Foreword 


This  volume  is  one  in  a  continuing  series  of  books  prepared  by 
the  Federal  Research  Division  of  the  Library  of  Congress  under 
the  Country  Studies — Area  Handbook  Program  sponsored  by  the 
Department  of  the  Army.  The  last  page  of  this  book  lists  the  other 
published  studies. 

Most  books  in  the  series  deal  with  a  particular  foreign  country, 
describing  and  analyzing  its  political,  economic,  social,  and  national 
security  systems  and  institutions,  and  examining  the  interrelation- 
ships of  those  systems  and  the  ways  they  are  shaped  by  cultural 
factors.  Each  study  is  written  by  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  social 
scientists.  The  authors  seek  to  provide  a  basic  understanding  of 
the  observed  society,  striving  for  a  dynamic  rather  than  a  static 
portrayal.  Particular  attention  is  devoted  to  the  people  who  make 
up  the  society,  their  origins,  dominant  beliefs  and  values,  their  com- 
mon interests  and  the  issues  on  which  they  are  divided,  the  nature 
and  extent  of  their  involvement  with  national  institutions,  and  their 
attitudes  toward  each  other  and  toward  their  social  system  and 
political  order. 

The  books  represent  the  analysis  of  the  authors  and  should  not 
be  construed  as  an  expression  of  an  official  United  States  govern- 
ment position,  policy,  or  decision.  The  authors  have  sought  to 
adhere  to  accepted  standards  of  scholarly  objectivity.  Corrections, 
additions,  and  suggestions  for  changes  from  readers  will  be  wel- 
comed for  use  in  future  editions.

Preface 


Like  its  predecessor,  this  study  attempts  to  review  the  history 
and  treat  in  a  concise  and  objective  manner  the  dominant  social, 
political,  economic,  and  military  aspects  of  South  Korea.  Under 
Roh  Tae  Woo,  who  was  elected  president  of  the  Sixth  Republic 
in  1987  (as  well  as  under  the  previous  president,  Chun  Doo  Hwan, 
1980-87),  South  Korea  has  been  struggling  to  maintain  its  eco- 
nomic successes.  Movement  in  more  democratic  directions  has  been 
much  slower  than  economic  development.  Political  unrest,  labor 
strikes,  and  student  agitation  continued  to  challenge  the  govern- 
ment in  the  early  1990s. 

Sources  of  information  included  books,  scholarly  journals,  for- 
eign and  domestic  newspapers,  official  reports  of  governments  and 
international  organizations,  and  numerous  periodicals  on  Korean 
and  East  Asian  affairs.  Chapter  bibliographies  appear  at  the  end 
of  the  book,  and  brief  comments  on  some  of  the  more  valuable 
sources  recommended  for  further  reading  appear  at  the  end  of  each 
chapter.  A  Glossary  also  is  included. 

Spellings  of  place-names  used  in  the  book  are  in  most  cases  those 
approved  by  the  United  States  Board  on  Geographic  Names. 
However,  the  generic  parts  appended  to  some  geographic  names 
have  been  dropped  and  their  English  equivalents  substituted:  for 
example,  Cheju  Island,  not  Cheju-do,  and  South  Ch'ungch'ong 
Province,  not  Ch'ungch'ong-namdo.  The  name  South  Korea  has 
been  used  where  appropriate  in  place  of  the  official  name,  Repub- 
lic of  Korea.  The  McCune-Reischauer  system  of  transliteration 
has  been  employed,  except  in  cases  of  the  names  of  some  promi- 
nent national  figures,  internationally  recognized  corporations,  and 
the  city  of  Seoul,  where  the  more  familiar  journalistic  equivalent 
is  used.  The  names  of  Korean  authors  writing  in  English  are  spelled 
as  given. 

Measurements  are  given  in  the  metric  system.  A  conversion  table 
is  provided  to  assist  those  readers  who  are  unfamiliar  with  metric 
measurements  (see  table  1,  Appendix). 

The  body  of  the  text  reflects  information  available  as  of  June 
1990.  Certain  other  portions  of  the  text,  however,  have  been  up- 
dated: the  Introduction  discusses  significant  events  that  have  oc- 
curred since  the  completion  of  research,  and  the  Bibliography 
includes  recently  published  sources  thought  to  be  particularly  helpful 
to  the  reader.

Introduction 


FOR  NEARLY  A  HALF-CENTURY,  the  Republic  of  Korea 
(South  Korea)  and  the  United  States  have  maintained  a  close  rela- 
tionship. Since  the  mid-1980s,  South  Korea  has  been  the  seventh 
or  eighth  largest  trading  partner  of  the  United  States,  and  the 
United  States  has  ranked  as  South  Korea's  first  or  second  trading 
partner.  In  1990,  nearly  four  decades  after  the  end  of  the  Korean 
War  (1950-53),  Washington  retained  more  than  45,000  troops  on 
the  Korean  Peninsula  committed  to  the  defense  of  South  Korea. 
During  the  1991  conflict  in  the  Persian  Gulf,  Seoul  joined  other 
coalition  partners  of  the  United  States  and  provided  a  military  med- 
ical team  and  several  hundred  million  dollars  in  support  of  the  cam- 
paign to  end  the  Iraqi  occupation  of  Kuwait. 

Ties  between  the  two  countries  extend  to  language,  education, 
and  culture.  In  1991  English  was  the  primary  foreign  language 
studied  in  South  Korea,  and  for  some  time  it  has  been  popularly 
said  that  more  Ph.Ds  from  American  universities  work  for  the  South 
Korean  government  than  for  the  United  States  government. 
Hundred  of  thousands  of  United  States  servicemen,  businessmen, 
Peace  Corps  volunteers,  and  missionaries  have  lived  and  worked 
in  South  Korea,  and  as  many  as  1 .5  million  South  Koreans — one 
fourth  of  all  overseas  Koreans — have  emigrated  to  the  United  States. 

The  Korean  Peninsula  has  been  inhabited  since  paleolithic  times, 
and  Korean  historians  trace  the  ethnic  roots  of  the  Korean  people 
at  least  as  far  back  as  the  pottery-using  cultures  of  the  fourth  and 
third  centuries  B.C.  Early  tribal  groups  formed  numerous  federa- 
tions, and  over  the  centuries  these  combined  into  larger  state-like 
entities.  Sometime  before  the  fourth  century  B.C.,  at  least  one  of 
these  entities  had  begun  to  refer  to  its  leaders  by  the  Chinese  title 
for  king,  wang.  Three  of  these  states,  boasting  an  aristocratic  so- 
cial structure  and  centralized  institutions  of  government,  had  come 
to  dominate  Korea  by  the  early  centuries  of  the  present  era,  con- 
ducting trade  and  intermittent  warfare  with  each  other  and  with 
China.  Stretching  down  from  Manchuria  in  the  north  was  the  king- 
dom of  Koguryo;  in  the  southwest  and  southeast,  respectively,  the 
kingdoms  of  Paekche  and  Silla  held  sway.  Korean  political,  cul- 
tural, and  linguistic  unity  dates  back  to  the  unification  of  these  three 
kingdoms  under  Silla  in  the  seventh  century  A.D.,  making  Korea, 
despite  its  present  temporary  division  into  two  states,  one  of  the 
oldest  unified  nations  in  the  world. 


xxin 


Geographically  poised  between  China  and  Japan,  Korea  devel- 
oped its  own  social  and  cultural  patterns.  More  deeply  influenced 
than  Japan  by  Chinese  culture,  Korea  adopted  the  Chinese  model 
of  monarchy  and  successive  dynasties,  rather  than  developing  a 
single  imperial  line  from  its  early  tribal  federations.  Yet  Korea  re- 
tained its  native  preference  for  a  strongly  aristocratic  social  order 
based  on  hereditary  lineages.  Korea  also  served  as  one  of  several 
cultural  bridges  between  its  two  regional  neighbors,  taking  pride 
in  passing  along  advanced  Chinese  political,  philosophical,  reli- 
gious, and  literary  ideas  and  models  to  what  Koreans  consistently 
perceived  as  a  less  well-developed  Japan. 

Korea's  geographic  position  often  made  it  a  focal  point  for  re- 
gional conflict.  Recovering  from  two  Japanese  invasions  in  the  late 
sixteenth  century  and  Manchu  incursions  several  decades  later, 
Korea's  last  traditional  dynasty — the  kingdom  of  Choson  (1392- 
1910) — withdrew  into  self-protective  isolation,  stricdy  regulating 
travel  and  commerce  with  Japan  while  maintaining  its  tributary 
status  with  China.  This  policy  was  increasingly  challenged,  how- 
ever, during  the  nineteenth  century,  when  Western  diplomats, 
traders,  and  adventurers  sought  to  open  all  of  East  Asia,  includ- 
ing what  they  termed  the  Korean  "Hermit  Kingdom,"  to 
European-style  trade  and  diplomatic  relations.  In  the  end,  Japan 
forced  open  the  Korean  door,  imposing  a  Western-style  "unequal 
treaty"  on  Korea  in  1876. 

At  the  turn  of  the  century,  Korea  was  the  object  of  two  wars 
as  China  and  Japan  in  turn  fought  to  maintain  footholds  on  the 
peninsula  and  to  exclude  a  Russia  keenly  interested  in  Korea's 
warm- water  ports.  In  the  first  half  of  the  twentieth  century,  Korea 
was  victimized  by  several  decades  of  colonization  by  Japan 
(1910-45),  becoming  by  the  1930s  a  stepping  stone  and  industrial 
base  for  Japanese  military  expansion  into  Manchuria  and  north- 
ern China.  Although  many  Koreans  fought  for  independence  from 
Japanese  rule,  Korea's  liberation  in  1945  was  brought  about  not 
by  Korean  efforts  but  by  the  Allied  victory  over  Japan  and  by  the 
division  of  Korea  into  two  zones  of  occupation  by  the  United  States 
and  the  Soviet  Union.  In  the  southern  zone,  the  United  States  Army 
Military  Government  in  Korea  lasted  for  three  years  before  the 
establishment  of  the  Republic  of  Korea.  South  Korea's  immedi- 
ate postwar  fate  was  dominated  not  only  by  the  Cold  War  antago- 
nism of  the  two  great  powers  but  also  by  seemingly  irreconcilable 
political  differences  among  Koreans  themselves.  Separate  and  an- 
tagonistic states  controlled  the  two  halves  of  the  peninsula  by  1948, 
setting  the  stage  for  the  considerable  civil  conflict  that  led  to  the 
Korean  War  (1950-53). 


XXIV 


Given  the  tragic  and  bitter  legacy  of  the  loss  of  national  indepen- 
dence under  Japanese  colonial  rule,  the  experience  of  national  par- 
tition in  1945,  and  the  ensuing  civil  war,  educational  authorities 
in  South  Korea  have  emphasized  areas  of  national  identity  in  school- 
book  treatments  of  Korean  history  and  language.  Despite  many 
differences  among  South  Koreans,  this  carefully  nourished  national 
consciousness  centered  perceptions  on  national  independence  and 
the  place  of  Korea  on  the  stage  of  world  history.  Such  thinking 
underlies  much  of  the  vigorously  pursued  economic  development 
of  the  past  three  decades  and  also  carried  on  a  long  tradition  of 
modern  Korean  thought.  For  example,  after  Japan  seized  control 
of  Korean  foreign  relations  and  military  affairs  in  1905,  Korean 
historian  Ch'oe  Nam-son  compared  the  nation's  parlous  condition 
with  the  glories  of  ancient  Korean  dynasties  and  asked,  "How  long 
will  it  take  us  to  accomplish  the  goal  of  flying  our  sacred  national 
flag  above  the  world? ' '  As  energetic  national  preparations  for  the 
1988  Seoul  Olympics — under  the  slogan  "Korea  to  the  world,  the 
world  to  Korea" — demonstrated,  toward  the  end  of  the  century 
South  Koreans  still  were  striving  for  national  success  and  an  in- 
ternational reputation  in  response  to  that  same  impulse. 

South  Korean  urbanization — which  increased  by  a  rate  of  more 
than  4  percent  annually  during  the  1960s  and  1970s — continued 
at  a  slightly  slower  rate  of  3  percent  per  year  in  the  1980s.  Accord- 
ing to  the  1990  census,  Seoul  was  one  of  the  world's  largest  cities. 
Its  more  than  10.6  million  people  accounted  for  almost  one  quarter 
of  the  country's  43.5  million  people.  The  concentration  of  the  popu- 
lation in  Seoul  prompted  efforts  by  city  planners  to  decentralize 
government  and  other  functions  by  moving  some  ministries  and 
agencies  to  Taejon.  The  growth  of  Seoul  and  other  cities,  although 
partly  caused  by  interurban  migration,  also  was  accompanied  by 
a  reduction  of  the  rural  farming  population,  especially  in  the  poorer 
areas  of  the  southwest.  This  migration  was  reflected  in  Seoul  by 
the  numerous  restaurants  that  offered  regional  specialties  and  by 
the  electoral  districts  that  produced  bloc  votes  for  presidential  can- 
didates from  one  or  another  province  in  the  December  1987 
presidential  election. 

Another  social  change  with  political  implications  was  the  in- 
creased emphasis  on  higher  education  during  the  1980s.  When  army 
General  Chun  Doo  Hwan  took  power  in  1980,  he  approved  a  plan 
to  double  college  and  university  enrollments  within  four  years. 
Perhaps,  as  some  observers  said,  the  change  was  intended  to  sub- 
merge traditional  student  protest  in  a  sea  of  aspiring  professionals 
and  white-collar  workers.  Yet  planners  also  knew  that  broader  edu- 
cation was  vital  to  continued  economic  growth,  inasmuch  as  the 


xxv 


country's  exports  faced  increasing  competition  from  labor-rich 
Third  World  countries  and  Seoul  sought  to  shift  to  knowledge- 
intensive  and  high-technology  industries.  By  1990,  according  to 
a  Ministry  of  Education  study,  one  South  Korean  in  four  was  a 
student.  The  number  of  South  Koreans  in  college  by  the  late  1980s 
comprised  some  35  percent  of  the  relevant  age-group,  a  higher  per- 
centage than  Japan  or  any  country  in  the  world  except  the  United 
States  and  the  Philippines. 

The  changes  in  higher  education  corroded  old  political  patterns 
and  in  several  ways  may  have  set  the  stage  for  the  political  and 
constitutional  reforms  of  the  late  1980s.  With  the  spread  of  scien- 
tific and  technical  education  and  the  continued  growth  of  a  new 
managerial  elite,  the  military's  claim — heard  especially  in  the  high- 
growth  years  of  the  1960s  and  early  1970s — to  managerial  and  tech- 
nical leadership  became  increasingly  irrelevant.  The  more  educated 
populace  also  seemed  less  tolerant  of  press  censorship  and  other 
authoritarian  practices.  Meanwhile,  increasing  student  enrollments 
and  the  consequent  rise  in  the  number  of  college  graduates  in  the 
job  pool  created  even  greater  discontent  among  many  unemployed 
and  underemployed  graduates  and  provided  a  setting  in  which  a 
small  but  increasingly  radical  student  dissident  movement — often 
financed  with  sizable  student  association  fees — could  find  its  voice. 

The  steady  modernization  and  urbanization  of  society  were  ac- 
companied by  a  continued  growth  in  nostalgia  for  Korea's  past. 
Even  in  the  countryside,  the  1980s  saw  a  continuation  of  the  late 
1970s  revival  of  folk  arts,  often  supported  by  generous  government 
subsidies  for  regional  festivals  and  *  'living  cultural  treasures" — 
experts  in  traditional  technologies,  crafts,  and  arts,  such  as  architec- 
ture, temple  painting,  or  traditional  p  'ansori  folk  opera.  Shaman- 
ism, ignored  by  modernizing  elites  in  the  1950s  and  1960s,  was 
much  more  openly  practiced  in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  when  it  was 
not  unusual  to  see  a  new  office  building  or  major  tourist  hotel  for- 
mally opened  with  shamanistic  rites.  Many  urban  professionals  en- 
joyed taking  their  children  to  visit  the  Folk  Village  near  Seoul  where 
they  could  examine  a  well- scrubbed  reconstruction  of  nineteenth- 
century  country  life  and  try  to  imagine  a  quieter,  less  hurried  time. 
The  revival  of  traditional  culture  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  cut  across 
class  and  political  lines.  It  had  a  political  dimension  as  well,  seen 
both  in  dissident  student  adaptations  of  traditional  anti- aristocratic 
mask  dramas  that  lampooned  the  social  and  political  establishment 
and  in  government  promotion  of  school  trips  to  the  shrine  of 
sixteenth-century  naval  hero  Yi  Sun- sin. 

Religious  commitment  was  strong  for  many  South  Koreans, 
nearly  half  of  whom  were  affiliated  with  an  organized  religious 


xxvi 


community  in  the  1980s.  About  20  percent  of  the  population  was 
Buddhist,  whereas  a  somewhat  larger  and  more  rapidly  growing 
Christian  community  gave  South  Korea  the  second  largest  propor- 
tion of  Christians  in  Asia,  following  the  Philippines.  Although  con- 
servative on  the  whole,  the  country's  Christian  population  also 
included  some  of  the  most  active  elements  of  the  political  dissident 
movement. 

Confucianism  was  dominant  during  the  last  dynasty  (1392-1910) 
but  declined  in  force  as  a  political  philosophy  following  the  loss 
of  independence  to  Japan  in  1910.  Nevertheless,  it  retained  a  lin- 
gering impact  on  social  relations  even  in  the  early  1990s.  Attempts 
to  revive  Confucian  ethical  values,  whether  through  the  Park  Chung 
Hee  government's  campaign  for  filial  piety  and  loyalty  in  the  1970s 
or  in  occasional  public  seminars  or  newspaper  editorials  through 
the  early  1990s,  reflected  both  a  decline  in  the  practice  of  Confu- 
cianism as  a  living  creed  and  the  feeling  of  many  South  Koreans 
that  rapid  modernization  and  the  growth  of  materialism  had  created 
an  ethical  vacuum. 

Population  policies  begun  in  the  1960s  continued  their  momen- 
tum through  the  1980s.  Tax  and  medical  insurance  benefits  for 
smaller  families,  for  example,  provided  additional  incentives  for 
family  planning  in  the  early  1980s.  The  government  also  distributed 
posters,  such  as  one  featuring  an  attractive  young  couple  and  the 
slogan,  "Have  one  child  and  raise  it  well."  The  effect  of  such  ef- 
forts continued  to  be  felt  in  a  decline  in  the  number  of  primary 
and  middle  school  students;  the  number  of  middle  school  students 
alone  dropped  by  half  a  million  during  the  1980s.  The  success  of 
the  family  planning  program  was  suggested  by  the  desire  of  other 
Asian  countries  to  send  officials  to  Seoul  for  training. 

As  the  number  of  births  per  couple  reached  1 .9  in  1990,  the  popu- 
lation growth  rate  dropped  to  just  over  0.9  percent  from  almost 
1.6  a  decade  earlier,  causing  the  Economic  Planning  Board  to 
predict  serious  labor  shortages  and  to  authorize  importing  increased 
numbers  of  foreign  workers.  Many  factories  already  had  been  com- 
pensating for  such  shortfalls  by  hiring  illegal  immigrants  (1,000 
such  workers  were  deported  in  1990),  or  by  breaking  prevailing 
patterns  to  hire  married  women  in  substantial  numbers.  By  1991 
South  Koreans  also  were  beginning  to  reflect  on  the  social  and  policy 
implications  of  two  emerging  problems:  a  possible  male-female  im- 
balance by  the  end  of  the  1990s,  resulting  from  a  continuing  prefer- 
ence for  sons  and  use  of  family  planning  techniques;  and  projections 
of  a  steadily  increasing  proportion  of  elderly  in  the  population  over 
the  coming  two  decades.

South  Korea's  economic  growth  continued  to  be  driven  by  the 
import  of  raw  materials  and  semi-finished  components  (the  latter 
proportionally  declining  in  the  late  1980s)  and  the  export  of  finished 
industrial  products.  Manufacturing  accounted  for  more  than  30 
percent  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glossary),  aided 
by  the  rapid  modernization  of  technology  and  the  continuous  rein- 
vestment of  trade  proceeds.  By  the  end  of  the  1980s,  the  Republic 
of  Korea  was  the  world's  tenth  largest  steel  producer  and  had  made 
major  strides  in  mastering  the  production  technologies  required 
for  the  home  electronics  and  semiconductor  industries.  South 
Korean-made  televisions,  personal  computers,  videocassette  record- 
ers, and  microwave  ovens  increasingly  became  known  under  their 
own  brand  names,  although  dependence  on  Japan  for  key  compo- 
nents and  some  assembly  production  for  Japanese  companies  also 
continued. 

The  automotive  industry  gained  a  firmer  footing  under  close 
government  direction  following  overexpansion  in  the  late  1970s. 
Most  of  the  growth  in  the  early  1980s  was  fueled  by  overseas  sales, 
which  began  to  boom  in  1985,  but  also  was  stabilized  by  a  rapidly 
growing  domestic  market  by  the  end  of  the  decade.  Textiles  and 
construction,  both  staples  among  the  export  industries  in  the  1970s, 
continued  to  play  an  important  role  through  the  1980s.  As  South 
Korea's  comparative  advantage  in  labor  became  increasingly  subject 
to  challenge  from  developing  economies  in  Asia  and  elsewhere, 
however,  planners  looked  to  even  greater  social  investment  in  high- 
technology  fields,  such  as  materials  science,  biotechnology,  elec- 
tronics, and  aerospace,  and  to  an  economy  that  would  become 
technology-intensive  sometime  during  the  1990s. 

Growth  in  the  service  sector,  comprising  real  estate,  supply  ser- 
vices, entertainment,  the  hotel  industry,  and  other  services,  con- 
tinued in  the  late  1980s,  outpacing  increases  in  manufacturing.  The 
number  of  workers  in  service  industries  increased  by  8  percent  be- 
tween 1988  and  1989,  amounting  to  more  than  twice  the  rate  of 
increase  in  manufacturing-sector  employees  during  the  same  period. 
In  the  first  half  of  1990,  the  total  number  of  workers  in  manufac- 
turing declined  for  the  first  time  since  the  early  1960s.  In  1990  the 
Economic  Planning  Board,  concerned  over  this  trend  and  a  pro- 
jected shortfall  of  69,000  new  manufacturing  workers  for  the  year, 
announced  its  Industrial  Manpower  Supply  Program.  The  pro- 
gram was  designed  to  stem  the  exodus  of  skilled  manpower  from 
manufacturing  industries  by  offering  long-term  workers  preferred 
admission  to  college  and  university  night-school  programs.  The 
government  also  prepared  to  use  tax  penalties  and  higher  utility 
rates  to  slow  the  growth  in  what  it  viewed  as  unproductive  "  con- 
sumption industries."

As  South  Korea  continued  to  industrialize  and  urbanize  during 
the  1980s,  the  agricultural  sector  drifted  into  stepchild  status.  Offi- 
cial support  for  rice  prices  dropped  behind  the  rate  of  inflation  in 
the  mid-1980s  as  Seoul  attempted  to  reduce  government  costs. 
Urban  growth  contributed  to  a  series  of  problems.  Young  people 
were  sent  to  the  cities  for  education  or  left  the  farms  to  seek  em- 
ployment and  left  behind  a  smaller  and  increasingly  older  farm 
population.  Young  bachelor  farmers  had  greater  difficulty  in  finding 
wives  willing  to  undergo  the  rigors  of  rural  life.  Productivity  gains 
failed  to  keep  up  with  changes  in  population,  leading  to  greater 
imports  of  wheat  and  soybeans.  Rising  land  prices  caused  by  the 
housing  squeeze  and  commercial  and  industrial  construction  gave 
an  impression  of  increased  farmers'  assets,  even  as  modern 
machinery  costs  and  increased  use  of  consumer  credit  contributed 
to  higher  farm  indebtedness.  Tenancy  increased  from  21  percent 
to  more  than  30  percent  during  the  decade,  as  urban  investors  and 
the  larger  scale  farming  encouraged  by  the  government  absorbed 
increasingly  scarce  and  costly  farm  lands.  Average  farm  incomes 
had  fallen  well  below  urban  incomes  by  the  end  of  the  decade.  By 
1 990  many  farmers  could  agree  with  the  statement  of  the  founder 
of  a  matchmaking  center  for  bachelor  farmers  that  it  was  "time 
to  turn  the  government's  attention  to  farmers'  life  and  welfare." 

Part  of  increasing  farm  indebtedness  during  the  second  half  of 
the  1980s  was  used  to  finance  consumer  durables  that  brought  farm 
families  closer  to  national  standards,  even  as  the  gap  between  rural 
and  urban  incomes  was  increasing.  A  1990  report  of  the  Ministry 
of  Agriculture  and  Fisheries  indicated  that  more  than  90  percent 
of  rural  households  had  refrigerators,  electric  rice  cookers,  and  pro- 
pane gas  ranges.  Even  more  significant  were  major  increases  in 
rural  ownership  of  consumer  goods,  such  as  telephones  and  color 
television  sets,  which  served  to  link  rural  families  with  national  and 
international  developments  and  issues.  Such  linkage,  in  turn,  may 
have  contributed  both  to  an  increasing  awareness  of  the  growing 
rural-urban  gap  and  to  the  politicization  of  farmers'  movements 
in  response  to  foreign  pressures  to  liberalize  agricultural  markets. 

In  political  life,  South  Korea  began  the  1980s  with  an  old  pat- 
tern. For  the  third  time  in  two  decades,  a  military  leader  or  former 
military  leader  declared  a  state  of  political  crisis,  rewrote  the  con- 
stitution, and  drove  prominent  civilian  politicians  from  govern- 
ment through  farfetched  legal  charges  or  under  the  guise  of 
"political  purification."  Re-elected  president  in  electoral  college 
voting  in  February  1981,  former  General  Chun  Doo  Hwan  con- 
solidated his  control  through  dominance  over  the  court  system,  use 


xxix 


of  the  state  security  apparatus,  and  tight  restriction  of  the  media. 
By  the  second  half  of  the  decade,  however,  Chun's  government 
had  lost  considerable  political  capital.  In  the  National  Assembly 
elections  of  1985,  Chun's  Democratic  Justice  Party  was  able  to  re- 
tain control  of  the  legislature  only  through  a  system  of  proportion- 
ality that  converted  its  scant  35  percent  of  the  popular  vote  into 
54  percent  of  the  seats.  Polls  taken  in  1986  showed  that  only  41 
percent  of  people  queried  expressed  confidence  in  political  leaders 
and  that  less  than  50  percent  of  respondents  were  satisfied  with 
the  kind  of  society  in  which  they  lived.  Dissatisfaction  with  govern- 
ment control  of  the  media  was  especially  strong  and  was  evident 
in  newspaper  editorials  and  a  popular  campaign  to  withhold  pay- 
ment of  compulsory  viewers'  fees  to  the  state-run  television  network. 

The  gradual  reemergence  of  banned  political  figures,  such  as 
Kim  Dae  Jung  and  Kim  Young  Sam,  began  in  1985  and  culmi- 
nated in  the  full  restoration  of  political  rights  to  all  former  politi- 
cians in  a  political  compromise  between  the  ruling  and  opposition 
political  parties  that  followed  severe  civil  disturbances  in  June  1987. 
Subsequent  events  marked  a  watershed  in  South  Korean  politics. 
First,  the  government  removed  virtually  all  restrictions  on  the 
media.  Next,  in  late  1987,  the  Constitution  was  revised — the  first 
constitutional  revision  since  1960  that  was  drafted  through  a  process 
of  multiparty  discussions.  The  1987  revision  promised  substantial 
changes  in  the  unequal  power  relationships  among  the  three 
branches  of  government  that  had  prevailed  at  least  since  the  in- 
ception of  theyusin  constitution  in  1972.  Under  the  new  fundamen- 
tal law,  the  president  lost  the  power  to  rule  through  emergency 
decrees  and  to  dissolve  the  legislature.  The  National  Assembly 
gained  new  rights  to  investigate  state  affairs,  to  hold  longer  an- 
nual sessions,  and  to  approve  Supreme  Court  appointments.  These 
and  other  constitutional  provisions  pointed  to  more  potential  au- 
tonomy for  the  legislature,  the  court  system,  and  for  the  constitu- 
tional review  of  legislation. 

The  presidential  election  of  December  1987  placed  a  former  army 
general,  Roh  Tae  Woo  of  the  ruling  Democratic  Justice  Party,  in 
the  Blue  House,  or  presidential  mansion.  A  minority  president, 
he  won  only  36  percent  of  the  votes  cast.  Kim  Young  Sam  and 
Kim  Dae  Jung,  who  together  accounted  for  54  percent  of  the  votes, 
accused  Roh's  party  of  election  fraud,  while  apologizing  to  the  pub- 
lic for  their  failure  to  agree  between  themselves  on  a  unified  oppo- 
sition candidacy.  The  charge  of  fraud  on  a  scale  great  enough  to 
have  swung  the  election  was  undermined  at  the  time  by  the  frag- 
mentary and  anecdotal  evidence  presented  and  by  the  insistence 
of  each  of  the  two  Kims  that  he  was  the  one  who  would  have 


xxx 


prevailed  in  the  absence  of  government  misconduct.  In  1990, 
however,  the  government  admitted  to  one  serious  legal  breach — 
the  diversion  of  more  than  US$14  million  dollars  from  the  1987 
national  budget  to  support  Roh's  election  campaign.  For  some  ob- 
servers, it  remained  an  open  question  whether  other  large-scale 
irregularities  may  have  occurred,  or  what  further  steps  the  govern- 
ment might  have  taken  to  ensure  victory  had  the  two  major  oppo- 
sition candidates  been  unified. 

In  the  National  Assembly  elections  held  in  April  1988,  the  rul- 
ing party  lost  a  working  majority  for  the  first  time  in  South  Korea's 
history.  The  new  balance  of  forces  in  the  legislature  made  a  re- 
ality of  the  separation  of  powers  provided  for  in  the  new  Constitu- 
tion when  opposition  assembly  members  joined  forces  to  reject 
President  Roh's  first  appointment  for  chief  justice  of  the  Supreme 
Court  in  the  summer  of  1988.  Through  the  rest  of  1988  and  1989, 
additional  signs  of  the  new  order  were  seen  in  the  distribution  of 
committee  chairmanships  among  the  ruling  and  opposition  par- 
ties and  in  the  process  of  compromise,  as  floor  leaders  of  the  four 
principal  parties  periodically  met  to  negotiate  working  agendas  for 
the  legislature  and  its  committees.  As  1989  ended,  Roh's  party  was 
engaged  in  secret  negotiations  with  two  of  the  three  opposition  par- 
ties to  bring  this  process  of  compromise  under  firmer  control. 

As  a  result  of  these  talks,  Roh's  party  merged  with  Kim  Young 
Sam's  Reunification  Democratic  Party  and  Kim  Chong-p'il's  New 
Democratic  Republican  Party  to  create  a  new  Democratic  Liberal 
Party  (DLP)  in  January  1990.  Some  observers  likened  the  result- 
ing coalition  to  Japan's  Liberal  Democratic  Party.  Each  of  the 
former  opposition  party  leaders  clearly  hoped  to  become  an  im- 
portant power  broker  within  the  ruling  party  and  perhaps  also  to 
become  the  party's  candidate  for  the  1992  presidential  election. 

In  the  short  term,  the  formation  of  the  DLP  provided  the  presi- 
dent with  a  substantial  majority  in  the  National  Assembly,  while 
politically  isolating  his  most  uncompromising  political  opponent, 
Kim  Dae  Jung.  Seen  in  longer-term  perspective,  the  merger  cur- 
tailed the  broader  processes  of  compromise  and  cooperation  in  the 
National  Assembly  that  had  included  even  Kim's  Party  for  Peace 
and  Democracy  (PPD)  in  1988  and  1989.  It  further  put  the  new 
ruling  party  in  the  awkward  position  of  having  to  pass  important 
legislation  in  the  absence  of  opposition  politicians,  who  boycotted 
the  legislature  on  several  occasions  during  1990.  The  merger  also 
complicated  factional  politics  within  the  ruling  party. 

Although  politicians  were  permitted  to  change  parties  under  the 
1987  Constitution  and  related  laws,  Kim  Dae  Jung  immediately 
labelled  the  move  a  "coup  d'etat  against  representative  politics" 


xxxi 


and  called,  unsuccessfully,  for  new  elections.  A  small  number  of 
legislators  from  Kim  Young  Sam's  party  also  objected  to  the  new 
super-party  and  eventually  formed  the  small  Democratic  Party. 
Kim  Dae  Jung's  isolated  Party  for  Peace  and  Democracy  spent 
much  of  1990  and  early  1991  fulminating  against  the  DLP  and 
attempting  to  embarrass  the  government  politically  by  boycotting 
National  Assembly  sessions  or  attempting  to  resign.  The  disengage- 
ment of  the  PPD  often  seemed  to  leave  it  marginalized  and  unable 
to  contribute  to  major  legislation  or  even  to  influence  issues  in  which 
it  had  an  immediate  political  interest,  such  as  the  scheduling  of 
small  district  local  elections  in  March  1991 .  Awareness  of  the  costs 
of  intransigence  may  have  prompted  a  more  moderate  approach 
in  the  second  half  of  1991.  In  private  talks  with  President  Roh  in 
September,  Kim  Dae  Jung  successfully  lobbied  for  several  regional 
development  projects  in  the  Cholla  region. 

By  mid- 1991  the  DLP  coalition  was  beginning  to  show  signs  of 
strain,  brought  about  by  differences  over  questions  such  as  the  tim- 
ing of  the  upcoming  1992  presidential  and  National  Assembly  elec- 
tions and  disagreement  over  how  the  party's  presidential  candidate 
would  be  chosen.  On  most  such  issues,  Kim  Chong-p'il  and  Presi- 
dent Roh  formed  a  mini-coalition  within  the  party,  opposed  by 
Kim  Young  Sam  and  his  followers.  Competition  for  the  party's 
presidential  nomination  reintensified  after  National  Assembly  elec- 
tions in  March  1992,  in  which  the  DLP  won  slightly  less  than  50 
percent  of  the  seats.  The  DLP  was  able  to  recover  a  bare  majority 
by  absorbing  several  members  who  had  run  as  independents. 

Kim  Dae  Jung's  party  encountered  major  defeats  in  local 
elections  in  March  and  June  1991 .  It  subsequently  absorbed  small 
numbers  of  opposition  lawmakers,  becoming  in  turn  the  New 
Democratic  Party  and  finally,  under  Kim's  joint  leadership  with 
Yi  Ki-t'aek,  the  Democratic  Party  (DP)  in  September.  The  DP, 
which  included  some  members  from  outside  the  Cholla  region,  con- 
tinued to  fight  the  ruling  DLP  across  a  variety  of  issues,  including 
tax  and  budget  policy,  hyperinflation  in  urban  land  prices,  and 
corruption.  Like  the  Kim  Young  Sam  faction  within  the  DLP,  the 
DP  opposed  possible  revision  of  the  Constitution  to  create  a 
parliamentary  system  of  government.  In  National  Assembly  elec- 
tions in  March  1992,  the  DP  won  a  respectable  31.1  percent  of 
the  seats. 

Outside  the  world  of  the  parties,  other  features  of  political  life 
changed  during  the  1980s.  Professional  associations  and  interest 
groups,  long  under  the  domination  of  the  state,  began  to  strive  for 
more  autonomy.  Farmers'  associations — traditionally  little  more 
than  mechanisms  for  communicating  government  policies — began 


xxxn 


to  proliferate  and  to  protest  trade  liberalization  measures.  Profes- 
sional associations  of  university  teachers,  journalists,  and  lawyers 
also  became  increasingly  outspoken  on  political  issues.  The  major 
business  conglomerates — chaebol — sought  a  greater  role  in  economic 
policy  formation.  The  voices  of  industrial  associations  were  heard 
more  clearly  as  the  respective  economic  ministries  began  to  gain 
influence  within  a  less  centralized  state  planning  structure.  At  the 
fringes  of  politics,  an  extremist  wing  of  the  leftist  student  move- 
ment conducted  sporadic  violence  through  the  1980s.  The  violence 
peaked  in  dozens  of  arson  or  Molotov  cocktail  assaults  against 
government  offices,  commercial  establishments,  police  boxes,  and 
United  States  diplomatic  and  cultural  facilities  in  late  1988  and 
1989. 

South  Korea's  diplomacy  during  the  1980s,  while  remaining 
oriented  toward  the  West,  also  aggressively  pursued  closer  ties  with 
China,  the  Soviet  Union,  and  East  European  countries.  Trade  with 
these  countries,  obscured  by  Seoul's  nonpublication  of  the  rele- 
vant import-export  statistics,  continued  to  grow  throughout  the  de- 
cade, and  was  matched  by  a  variety  of  other  contacts,  culminating 
in  the  participation  of  the  Soviet  Union,  China,  and  all  the  major 
East  European  countries  in  the  1988  Seoul  Olympics.  These  ef- 
forts, which  South  Korea  termed  pukpang  chongch'aek,  meaning 
"Nordpolitik"  or  northern  policy,  were  intended  to  diversify  the 
country's  global  trade  relations  and  to  give  Seoul  greater  leverage 
in  its  difficult  relationship  with  the  Democratic  People's  Republic 
of  Korea  (North  Korea). 

Seoul's  northern  policy  alone  would  probably  have  accomplished 
little  without  the  dramatic  liberalizing  reforms  in  East  European 
countries,  which  made  it  possible  for  South  Korea  to  establish  diplo- 
matic relations  with  all  nations  of  Eastern  Europe  by  the  end  of 
the  1980s.  The  opening  of  diplomatic  relations  with  the  Soviet 
Union  in  September  1990  followed  a  series  of  high-level  bilateral 
meetings  in  1989  and  early  1990. 

South  Korea's  two-way  trade  with  communist  countries  increased 
by  one-third  in  1990  to  reach  an  estimated  US$5.6  billion.  Increased 
trade  relations  with  the  Soviet  Union  followed  closely  on  the  heels 
of  the  1988  Seoul  Olympics,  driven  by  Moscow's  perception  that 
South  Korea  could  play  an  important  role  in  the  development  of 
the  Soviet  Far  East.  As  with  other  East  European  countries,  South 
Korea's  exports  to  the  Soviet  Union  were  heavily  concentrated  in 
electrical  and  electronic  appliances.  During  1990  and  early  1991, 
news  of  bilateral  exchanges,  civil  aviation  agreements,  and  pend- 
ing commercial  deals  between  the  chaebol  and  the  Soviet  Union  filled 
the  South  Korean  press.  By  the  end  of  1991 ,  South  Korea  had  paid 


xxxiii 


or  approved  slightly  more  than  half  of  a  promised  US$3  billion 
package  of  loans,  commodity  credits,  and  project  assistance  to  the 
Soviet  Union,  and  it  was  expected  that  Seoul's  aid  program  would 
continue  with  the  new  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States. 

Trade  with  China,  which  began  with  quiet  transactions  in  the 
late  1970s,  was  estimated  to  have  reached  US$1  billion  in  1985 
and  more  than  US$5  billion  in  1991 .  The  importance  of  the  Seoul- 
Beijing  economic  relationship  was  demonstrated  in  the  establish- 
ment of  trade  offices  with  limited  consular  functions  in  the  two  cap- 
itals in  October  1991  and  a  trade  agreement  two  months  later,  in 
which  South  Korea  and  China  exchanged  most-favored-nation  sta- 
tus. The  political  component  in  such  trade  remained  prominent, 
as  evidenced  in  Seoul's  tolerance  for  sustained  balance  of  payments 
deficits.  In  the  case  of  trade  with  China,  such  deficits  grew  from 
US$1.2  billion  in  1989  to  a  projected  US$2  billion  for  1991. 

Probably  because  China  remained  more  sensitive  than  the  Soviet 
Union  to  North  Korea's  reactions,  progress  in  moving  toward  diplo- 
matic relations  between  Seoul  and  Beijing  was  slower  than  the 
moves  establishing  formal  trade  ties.  In  the  mid-1980s,  the  two 
countries  had  increased  quasi-diplomatic  contacts  to  include  a  num- 
ber of  negotiations  to  resolve  a  series  of  sea  and  air  incidents,  and 
China  permitted  South  Korea's  attendance  at  international  con- 
ferences and  meetings  of  United  Nations  organizations  in  China. 
The  two  countries  also  participated  jointly  in  a  variety  of  athletic 
competitions  and  sports  exchanges.  In  September  1990,  China  ex- 
tended courtesy  diplomatic  status  to  South  Korean  athletic  offi- 
cials attending  the  Asian  Games  in  Beijing;  and  by  mutual 
agreement  senior  diplomats  in  the  trade  representative  offices  held 
formal  diplomatic  immunities  and  privileges  under  the  Vienna  Con- 
vention, reportedly  performing  consular  as  well  as  commercial 
duties.  Beijing  sent  a  vice  foreign  minister  to  the  Seoul  meeting 
of  the  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia 
and  the  Pacific  in  April  1991;  South  Korean-Chinese  discussions 
during  the  meeting  provided  the  highest  level  official  contact  to 
that  date  between  the  two  countries.  In  May  1991,  when  it  be- 
came clear  that  China  would  no  longer  support  its  North  Korean 
ally  by  vetoing  South  Korea's  membership  in  the  United  Nations, 
some  observers  believed  that  the  two  countries  had  moved  even 
closer  to  establishing  formal  diplomatic  ties. 

Over  the  past  two  decades,  South  Korea's  relations  with  North 
Korea  have  been  characterized  by  alternating  periods  of  tension 
and  dialogue.  A  joint  communique  issued  by  the  two  countries  on 
July  4,  1972,  agreed  to  continue  discussions  concerning  political 
and  military  questions  and  confidence-building  measures  to  be

implemented  through  a  North-South  Coordinating  Committee  and 
Red  Cross  channels.  Through  the  1970s,  however,  further  discus- 
sions stalled  as  each  side  reaffirmed  its  position  in  an  effort  to  claim 
and  retain  the  initiative  and  to  deny  legitimacy  to  the  other  side. 

In  early  1980,  the  two  countries  for  the  first  time  referred  to  each 
other  by  their  official  names  and  agreed  to  work  toward  prime 
ministers'  talks.  By  the  following  year,  negotiations  stalled  again 
after  P'yongyang  made  a  number  of  political  demands  on  the  Chun 
Doo  Hwan  government — including  withdrawal  of  United  States 
troops  from  South  Korea — as  a  precondition  for  further  talks  and 
also  sponsored  an  abortive  attempt  to  have  Chun  assassinated  by 
two  Canadian  gangsters.  A  second  attempt — a  bombing  in  October 
1983 — failed  to  kill  the  South  Korean  president  but  killed  four  cabi- 
net ministers  and  thirteen  other  officials  during  a  state  visit  to  Ran- 
goon, Burma.  In  1984  Seoul  rejected  Pyongyang's  proposals  for 
three-way  talks  that  would  have  included  Washington  but  excluded 
South  Korea  from  key  discussions  on  military  topics.  Bilateral  dis- 
cussions during  the  same  year  concerning  a  joint  Olympics  team 
failed  to  achieve  results  in  time  for  the  Los  Angeles  Olympics  in 
July. 

After  South  Korean  acceptance  of  North  Korean  rice,  cement, 
and  medicine  for  southern  flood  victims  in  September  1984,  the 
two  sides  conducted  talks  and  some  exchanges  on  a  range  of  issues 
for  a  sixteen-month  period  through  early  1986.  These  discussions 
in  the  mid-1980s  were  sometimes  acrimonious  and  frequently  in- 
terrupted, each  side  presenting  proposals,  as  one  observer  noted, 
that  almost  seemed  intended  to  provoke  rejection  by  the  other  or 
to  play  to  the  galleries  of  world  opinion.  In  retrospect,  however, 
it  can  be  seen  that  the  mid-1980s  discussions  were  successful  in 
establishing  institutions  for  dialogue  on  both  sides  and  in  laying 
down  multiple  channels  of  contact  and  communication  that  con- 
tinued to  function  through  the  early  1990s. 

A  series  of  talks  to  reunite  families  separated  by  national  divi- 
sion and  the  war  took  dozens  of  Red  Cross  representatives  and  even 
more  journalists  from  each  side  across  the  Demarcation  Line  dur- 
ing three  visits  in  1984.  In  September  1985,  several  dozen  North 
Koreans  and  South  Koreans  met  with  separated  family  members, 
and  a  similar  number  of  folk  art  performers  from  each  side  gave 
concerts  in  the  two  capitals. 

In  the  area  of  economic  cooperation,  vice-ministerial  level  con- 
ferences met  at  P'anmunjom  on  a  number  of  occasions  during  1984 
and  1985,  exploring  for  the  first  time  specific  trade,  transporta- 
tion, and  other  joint  projects.  South  Korean  and  North  Korean 
legislators  met  twice  in  July  1985  to  explore  political  issues.  Bilateral 


XXXV 


discussions  began  in  1984  concerning  a  North  Korean  proposal 
to  cohost  the  1988  Seoul  Olympic  Games.  After  an  interlude  fol- 
lowing the  North  Korean  bombing  of  a  South  Korean  airliner  over 
the  Andaman  Sea  in  November  1987,  Olympic  talks  continued 
through  mid- 1988,  when  they  broke  down  in  disagreement  over 
the  number  of  games  to  be  hosted  in  P'yongyang. 

The  two  Koreas  continued  to  talk  past  each  other  concerning 
broader  political  issues  during  much  of  1988  and  1989.  President 
Ron's  July  1988  proposal  for  freer  contacts  and  expanded  exchanges 
between  the  two  Koreas  and  the  eventual  establishment  of  a  Korean 
commonwealth  was  met  with  North  Korean  reiteration  of  Kim  II 
Sung's  1972  proposal  for  a  transitional  Democratic  Confederal 
Republic  of  Korea.  Meanwhile,  Seoul  began  to  disclose  the  exis- 
tence of  a  quiet  trade  relationship  between  the  two  countries  and 
in  early  1989  allowed  a  major  industrialist  to  travel  to  P'yongyang 
to  discuss  additional  forms  of  economic  cooperation.  North  Korea 
generally  welcomed  these  steps  but  also  continued  to  demand  abro- 
gation of  South  Korea's  National  Security  Act,  under  which  Seoul 
prosecuted  several  unauthorized  South  Korean  travellers  to  North 
Korea. 

An  important  breakthrough  in  relations  between  the  two  Koreas 
began  in  1990,  which  saw  the  beginning  of  a  series  of  prime 
ministerial  talks.  Held  alternately  in  Seoul  and  P'yongyang,  these 
garnered  substantial  publicity  but  little  progress  until  mid- 1991, 
when  it  became  clear  that  Seoul  had  won  China's  support  for  its 
plan  to  have  both  Koreas  simultaneously  admitted  to  the  United 
Nations.  That  event  took  place  in  September.  During  the  fourth 
round  of  prime  ministers'  talks  in  P'yongyang  in  October,  the  two 
Koreas  agreed  to  work  on  a  nonaggression  accord.  This  document, 
the  Agreement  on  Reconciliation,  Nonaggression,  Exchange  and 
Cooperation,  was  signed  in  Seoul  on  December  13,  1991.  It  took 
effect  in  mid- February  1992,  at  the  time  of  the  sixth  round  of  prime 
ministerial  talks  in  P'yongyang.  In  late  December  1991,  the  two 
Koreas  signed  a  separate  agreement  barring  either  side  from  hav- 
ing or  using  nuclear  weapons. 

Although  the  new  agreement  was  in  itself  a  landmark,  observers 
noted  that  it  was  essentially  a  promissory  note,  in  which  the  two 
Koreas  pledged  to  cease  negative  actions  toward  each  other  and  to 
continue  to  work  toward  resolution  of  several  important  issues.  These 
issues  included  a  declaration  of  nonaggression,  a  separate  peace 
treaty,  and  measures  to  promote  free  travel  and  correspondence. 
The  question  of  mutual  inspection  of  nuclear  facilities,  which  South 
Korea  held  to  be  of  overriding  importance,  still  was  being  discussed 
by  working-level  negotiators  in  late  March  1992.

South  Korea's  relationship  with  the  United  States  increasingly 
was  focused  on  bilateral  economic  issues,  spurred  by  a  current  ac- 
count surplus  that  began  in  the  mid-1980s  and  increasing  United 
States  pressures  to  open  South  Korean  markets  for  agricultural  and 
industrial  products  as  well  as  telecommunications  and  finance  ser- 
vices. These  issues  posed  a  problem  not  only  for  South  Korean 
diplomacy,  but  also  contributed  to  often  tumultuous  domestic  criti- 
cism of  Seoul  whenever  it  appeared  to  show  signs  of  weakness  in 
negotiations  with  Washington. 

An  important  issue  in  South  Korean-United  States  relations  dur- 
ing the  1980s  was  the  joint  security  relationship.  This  relationship 
not  only  encompassed  technical  issues  such  as  the  size,  composi- 
tion, financial  support,  and  legal  status  of  United  States  forces  sta- 
tioned in  South  Korea,  but  also  included  a  psychological  dimension 
because  of  the  popularly  perceived  role  of  the  joint  United  States- 
Republic  of  Korea  Combined  Forces  Command  in  the  brutal  kill- 
ings of  civilians  in  Kwangju  in  May  1980  during  the  coup  d'etat 
of  Chun  Doo  Hwan.  Facts  surrounding  the  Kwangju  incident — 
deliberately  distorted  under  Chun  Doo  Hwan's  martial  law 
authorities — remained  unclarified  until  the  United  States  govern- 
ment issued  a  detailed  statement  on  the  subject  in  1989.  The  state- 
ment, prepared  in  response  to  a  South  Korean  National  Assembly 
query,  showed  that  the  United  States  had  not  approved  the  coup 
and  that  the  troops  used  in  Kwangju  in  1980  were  not  under  oper- 
ational control  of  the  Combined  Forces  Command  but  had  taken 
their  orders  from  South  Korean  army  authorities  under  General 
Chun. 

The  Korean  War  permanently  enhanced  the  role  of  the  mili- 
tary in  South  Korean  society  and  politics  as  well  as  in  the  defense 
of  the  nation.  Although  South  Korean  military  officers  did  not  seek 
to  intervene  actively  in  politics  under  the  rule  of  President  Syng- 
man  Rhee  (1948-60),  the  coups  d'etat  of  generals  Park  Chung  Hee 
in  1961  and  Chun  Doo  Hwan  in  1980  demonstrated  that  some  ele- 
ments in  the  army  believed  that  the  nation's  security  demanded 
periodic  corrections  in  the  course  of  politics  as  well  as  prepared- 
ness against  North  Korea.  The  army's  influence  on  society  and 
politics  during  the  1980s  continued  to  be  seen  in  the  laws  that 
prevented  the  news  media  from  freely  covering  political-military 
issues,  mandatory  student  participation  in  the  college-level  Stu- 
dent Defense  Corps,  the  custom  of  preferential  placement  of  re- 
tired senior  officers  in  the  civil  service  and  in  state-run  corporations, 
and  in  the  frequent  practice  of  punitively  drafting  students  expelled 
for  demonstrating  against  the  government.  At  an  even  broader  level, 
harsh  discipline  within  the  military  probably  provided  the  most 


xxxvn 


significant  political  socialization  for  the  more  than  75  percent  of 
South  Korean  males  who  served  in  the  regular  army,  the  reserves, 
or  the  Homeland  Reserve  Force. 

Many  of  these  practices  were  the  subject  of  reforms  outlined  in 
the  Ministry  of  National  Defense  White  Paper  in  1988,  when  the 
Roh  administration  abolished  the  Student  Defense  Corps  and  made 
efforts  to  standardize  conscription  practices  and  to  provide  some 
protection  to  the  rights  of  recruits.  As  opinion  surveys  conducted 
in  1990  indicated,  however,  the  public  continued  to  support  re- 
forms that  would  improve  conditions  of  service,  eliminate  preferen- 
tial placement  of  retired  military  officers  in  the  civil  service,  and 
move  military  installations  away  from  populated  areas.  In  the  same 
year,  the  government  promulgated  additional  regulations  intended 
to  reduce  the  more  severe  aspects  of  military  life  and  protect  the 
basic  rights  of  recruits. 

As  the  1990s  began,  however,  some  observers  believed  that 
change  in  many  military  practices  would  come  slowly.  One  of  the 
most  outspoken  criticisms,  voiced  in  a  South  Korean  army  publi- 
cation in  1990,  was  by  an  army  major  general  who  charged  that 
"a  trend  characterized  by  assaults,  abusive  language  and  torture 
prevails  in  the  barracks."  He  called  upon  the  army  to  reform  it- 
self to  regain  the  trust  of  the  public.  The  charges  were  given  addi- 
tional credence  two  months  later  when  a  former  marine  corps  officer 
was  convicted  on  charges  of  torturing  a  subordinate.  In  October 
1990,  the  minister  of  national  defense  was  relieved  of  his  position 
after  a  former  undercover  agent  of  the  Defense  Security  Command 
disclosed  that  the  military  counterintelligence  organization  had  con- 
tinued to  maintain  dossiers  and  conduct  surveillance  on  some  1 ,300 
prominent  civilians,  including  politicians,  clergymen,  and  jour- 
nalists. The  government  pledged  its  efforts  to  return  the  Defense 
Security  Command  to  its  original  function.  The  following  year, 
however,  the  government  admitted  as  true  new  media  charges  that 
the  DSC  was  investigating  several  student  activists. 

Under  President  Chun  Doo  Hwan's  force  modernization  pro- 
gram, military  spending  increased  dramatically  during  the  1980s, 
exceeding  estimated  North  Korean  military  spending  during  most 
of  the  decade  and  nearly  doubling  to  US$10  billion  a  year  by  1990. 
As  a  result  of  improvements  in  the  defense  industrial  base  that  began 
in  the  mid-1970s,  70  percent  of  the  equipment  and  weaponry  used 
by  the  armed  forces  was  being  produced  by  domestic  defense  in- 
dustries by  the  late  1980s. 

At  the  end  of  the  1980s,  the  armed  forces  numbered  about 
650,000.  The  army  continued  to  divide  responsibilities  among  three 
commands.  The  First  Army  and  the  Third  Army  defended  the 


xxxviii 


country  from  the  threat  of  North  Korean  attack  in  their  positions 
along  the  Demilitarized  Zone.  The  Second  Army,  positioned  well 
south  of  Seoul,  was  charged  with  logistical  and  training  responsi- 
bilities and  managing  the  military  reserve  system.  Some  of  the  coun- 
try's forward  defense  was  also  provided  by  the  marine  corps,  which 
was  charged  with  defense  of  the  Han  River  estuary  and  five  is- 
lands located  close  to  North  Korea.  Specialized  army  units,  such 
as  the  Capital  Defense  Command,  defended  the  seat  of  govern- 
ment, while  the  Defense  Security  Command  in  Seoul  was  respon- 
sible for  military  counterintelligence  and  monitoring  politics  within 
and  outside  of  the  military. 

The  air  force  expanded  its  fighter  squadrons  during  the  1980s, 
operating  almost  700  combat,  transport,  and  training  aircraft  under 
its  three  commands.  In  wartime,  it  assumed  control  of  civilian  air- 
ports and  sections  of  major  highways  adapted  for  use  as  runways. 
During  the  1980s,  the  air  force  added  the  F-16  and  the  Republic 
of  Korea-United  States  coproduced  F-5  to  its  fighter  inventory. 
The  smaller  navy  also  modernized  during  the  decade,  focusing  on 
antisubmarine  warfare  and  the  deployment  of  new,  domestically 
produced  submarines,  frigates,  fast-attack  craft,  and  patrol  boats. 

In  1 990  Roh  moved  the  headquarters  of  the  army  and  air  force 
(with  navy  to  follow)  to  Taejon  in  an  effort  to  promote  more  effec- 
tive interservice  cooperation  and  more  efficient  command  and  con- 
trol of  the  armed  forces  during  wartime.  In  that  same  year,  the 
armed  forces  began  a  three-  to  five-year  plan  to  reorganize  the  com- 
mand structure.  Under  the  Armed  Forces  Organization  Act  passed 
in  July  and  promulgated  in  October,  the  joint  chiefs  of  staff  sys- 
tem in  use  since  the  Korean  War  would  be  replaced  with  a  more 
centralized  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  headquarters  in  which  operational 
control  of  the  military  forces  would  be  centralized  in  the  hands  of 
the  chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff.  The  new  Joint  Chiefs 
of  Staff  structure  was  designed  to  give  Seoul  a  wartime  command 
structure  separate  from  the  United  States-Republic  of  Korea  Com- 
bined Forces  Command. 

Fundamental  to  the  restructuring  was  the  separation  of  the  oper- 
ational and  administrative  functions  immediately  below  the  minister 
of  national  defense.  Under  the  reorganization,  which  took  effect 
on  Armed  Forces  Day,  October  1,  1990,  the  minister  of  national 
defense  defined  military  policy,  consolidated  planning,  and  allo- 
cated resources.  The  newly  invigorated  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  had 
the  authority  to  employ  military  units  of  all  the  military  services, 
including  task  forces  organization  for  joint  operations.  Unified  oper- 
ations, strategic  planning,  intelligence,  and  logistic  directorates  con- 
solidated functions  previously  controlled  by  the  separate  services, 


xxxix 


and  the  service  headquarters  were  reduced  to  maintenance,  sup- 
port, logistics,  personnel,  and  administrative  functions.  The  ser- 
vices were  to  have  reduced  intelligence  organizations,  but  most  of 
their  intelligence  assets  were  to  be  transferred  to  the  newly  created 
Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  Defense  Intelligence  Command. 

The  45,000  United  States  troops  in  Korea  in  1990  included  a 
small  contingent  at  P'anmunjom  with  the  United  Nations  Com- 
mand, some  32,000  United  States  Army  members  under  the  Eighth 
Army,  and  12,000  United  States  Air  Force  personnel  under  the 
Seventh  Air  Force.  Military  issues  relating  to  the  Combined  Forces 
Command  and  other  topics  were  discussed  in  annual  bilateral  Secu- 
rity Consultative  Meetings  and  in  other  joint  talks.  In  April  1990, 
the  United  States  Department  of  Defense  announced  a  program 
to  shift  gradually  the  United  States  military  presence  in  South  Korea 
to  a  smaller  and  more  supportive  role  as  international  political  con- 
ditions and  strengthened  South  Korean  defense  capabilities  per- 
mitted. As  part  of  this  program,  the  United  States  and  South  Korea 
also  agreed  to  disband  the  United  States-Republic  of  Korea  Com- 
bined Field  Army  and  to  separate  the  Ground  Component  Com- 
mand from  the  Combined  Forces  Command  during  the  1991-93 
period.  The  two  countries  further  agreed  to  appoint  a  South  Korean 
senior  officer  as  commander  of  the  Ground  Component  Command 
and  to  replace  the  senior  member  of  the  United  Nations  Command 
to  the  Military  Armistice  Commission  (MAC) — who  had  been  a 
United  States  officer  since  the  signing  of  the  armistice  in  1953 — with 
a  South  Korean  general.  The  appointment  of  a  South  Korean  army 
major  general  to  the  senior  MAC  position  was  made  in  March  1991 . 

At  the  twenty-second  Security  Consultative  Meeting  in  Novem- 
ber 1990,  Seoul  agreed  to  increase  its  financial  support  for  United 
States  forces  stationed  in  South  Korea  from  US$2.7  billion  in  1990 
to  US$2.8  billion  the  following  year.  This  figure  includes  valua- 
tions for  contributions  in  real  estate,  logistics  support,  discounted 
costs,  and  tax.  Other  issues  discussed  included  Seoul's  requests  for 
eased  United  States  restrictions  on  its  exports  of  coproduced  mili- 
tary hardware  and  improved  terms  for  United  States  Foreign  Mili- 
tary Sales  to  South  Korea.  Discussions  also  occurred  concerning 
possible  reductions  in  the  Team  Spirit  exercise  scheduled  for  1991, 
in  part  because  of  United  States  military  commitments  in  the  Per- 
sian Gulf  and  in  part  because  of  budgetary  reasons.  The  exercise 
was  reduced  in  scale  in  1990  and  1991  and  cancelled  in  1992 

In  January  1991,  South  Korea  and  the  United  States  signed  an 
amended  Status  of  Forces  Agreement  (SOFA)  governing  the  legal 
position  of  United  States  forces  in  South  Korea.  This  agreement,  the 
first  major  revision  of  the  1966  SOFA,  expanded  Seoul's  criminal 


xl 


jurisdiction  over  United  States  personnel.  Other  provisions  of  the 
agreement  concerned  customs  procedures  and  the  disposition  of 
property  no  longer  used  by  United  States  forces  in  South  Korea. 

In  1991  President  Bush  announced  that  the  United  States  would 
withdraw  its  nuclear  weapons  from  the  Korean  Peninsula,  and  later 
in  the  year,  in  a  statement  accepted  by  United  States  authorities, 
President  Roh  Tae  Woo  declared  that  the  country  was  free  of  such 
weapons.  In  1989  the  United  States  had  stated  that  North  Korea 
had  a  plutonium  reprocessing  facility  theoretically  capable  of  sup- 
porting nuclear  weapons  development.  By  mid- 1991,  United  States, 
Japanese,  and  South  Korean  estimates  held  that  North  Korea  was 
much  closer  to  producing  a  nuclear  weapon  than  previously  real- 
ized. By  the  end  of  the  year,  North  Korea,  which  had  signed  the 
Treaty  on  the  Nonproliferation  of  Nuclear  Weapons  in  1985,  still 
had  not  set  a  date  for  on-site  inspections  of  nuclear  facilities  by 
the  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency.  In  the  joint  statement 
issued  after  the  close  of  the  twenty-third  United  States-Republic 
of  Korea  Security  Consultative  Meeting  in  November  1991,  both 
countries  declared  that  they  had  "agreed  to  postpone  the  second 
stage  reduction  of  United  States  forces  in  Korea  until  such  time 
as  the  North  Korean  threat  and  uncertainties  of  developing  nuclear 
weapons  have  disappeared  and  the  security  in  this  region  is  fully 
guaranteed."  This  fact  meant  that  withdrawals  would  stop  once 
United  States  forces  were  drawn  down  to  the  36,000  target  for  stage 
one.  It  was  also  confirmed  at  the  meeting  that  the  United  States- 
Republic  of  Korea  Combined  Field  Army  would  be  dissolved  and 
that  a  Korean  general  would  be  made  Combined  Forces  Command 
ground  component  commander  in  1992,  further  decreasing  the 
United  States  profile.

Chapter  1.  Historical  Setting 


Panghwasuru  Pavilion,  port  of  Suwon  Castle 


A  SMALL  COUNTRY,  approximately  the  size  of  Britain,  Korea 
is  located  on  a  peninsula  that  protrudes  southward  from  the  north- 
eastern corner  of  the  Asian  continent.  It  is  an  old  country,  whose 
people  evolved  as  one  nation  from  the  seventh  century  until  1945, 
when  the  country  was  divided  by  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet 
Union  at  the  end  of  World  War  II.  The  ensuing  cold  war  created 
two  Korean  governments,  one  in  the  north  known  as  the  Demo- 
cratic People's  Republic  of  Korea  (DPRK),  and  another  in  the  south 
known  as  the  Republic  of  Korea  (ROK).  The  two  Koreas  engaged 
in  a  bitter  war  between  1950  and  1953  and  remained  divided  as 
of  1990,  even  though  the  two  governments  began  to  talk  to  each 
other  in  1971. 

South  Korea  and  North  Korea  took  distinctly  different  paths  of 
development  after  they  were  divided.  By  1990  North  Korea  had 
emerged  as  a  staunch  communist  society,  while  South  Korea  was 
evolving  into  a  liberal  democracy  after  many  years  of  military  dic- 
tatorship. The  two  societies,  however,  shared  a  common  tradition 
and  culture. 

Origins  of  the  Korean  Nation 

As  is  true  of  all  countries,  Korea's  geography  was  a  major  fac- 
tor in  shaping  its  history;  geography  also  influenced  the  manner 
in  which  the  inhabitants  of  the  peninsula  emerged  as  a  people  shar- 
ing the  common  feeling  of  being  Koreans  (see  Physical  Environ- 
ment, ch.  2).  The  Korean  Peninsula  protrudes  southward  from 
the  northeastern  corner  of  the  Asian  continent  and  is  surrounded 
on  three  sides  by  large  expanses  of  water.  Although  Japan  is  not 
far  from  the  southern  tip  of  this  landmass,  in  ancient  times  events 
on  the  peninsula  were  affected  far  more  by  the  civilizations  and 
political  developments  on  the  contiguous  Asian  continent  than  by 
those  in  Japan  (see  fig.  1). 

Because  the  Yalu  and  Tumen  rivers  have  long  been  recognized 
as  the  border  between  Korea  and  China,  it  is  easy  to  assume  that 
these  rivers  have  always  constituted  Korea's  northern  limits.  But 
such  was  not  the  case  in  the  ancient  period.  Neither  of  the  rivers 
was  considered  to  be  sacrosanct  by  the  ancient  tribes  that  dotted 
the  plains  of  Manchuria  and  the  Korean  Peninsula.  Because  the

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

The  Korean  people  trace  their  origins  to  the  founding  of  the  state 
of  Choson.  Choson  rose  on  the  banks  of  the  Taedong  River  in  the 
northwestern  corner  of  the  peninsula  and  prospered  as  a  civiliza- 
tion possessing  a  code  of  law  and  a  bronze  culture.  The  Choson 
people  gradually  extended  their  influence  not  only  over  other  tribes 
in  the  vicinity,  but  also  to  the  north,  conquering  most  of  the  Liao- 
dong  Basin.  However,  the  rising  power  of  the  feudal  state  of  Yen 
in  northern  China  (1122-225  B.C.)  not  only  checked  Choson's 
growth,  but  eventually  pushed  it  back  to  the  territory  south  of  the 
Ch'ongch'on  River,  located  midway  between  the  Yalu  and  Taedong 
rivers.  The  Chinese  had  discovered  iron  by  this  time  and  used  it 
extensively  in  farming  and  warfare;  the  Choson  people  were  not 
able  to  match  them.  Yen  became  established  in  the  territory  vacated 
by  Choson. 

Meanwhile,  much  of  what  subsequentiy  came  to  constitute  China 
proper  had  been  unified  for  the  first  time  under  Qin  Shi  Huangdi. 
Subsequently,  Yen  fell  to  the  Qin  state;  the  Qin  Dynasty  (221-207 
B.C.)  was  in  turn  replaced  by  a  new  dynasty,  the  Han  (206  B.C. - 
A.D.  220).  In  195  B.C.  a  former  officer  of  Yen  took  over  the  throne 
of  Choson  by  trickery,  after  which  he  and  his  descendants  ruled 
the  kingdom  for  eighty  years;  but  in  109-108  B.C.  China  attacked 
Choson  and  destroyed  it  as  a  political  entity.  The  Han  Chinese 
then  ruled  the  territory  north  of  the  Han  River  as  the  Four  Eastern 
Districts;  the  original  territory  of  Choson  became  Lolang  (or  Nang- 
nang  in  Korean).  (North  Korean  historians  have  argued  that  the 
Lolang  District  was  located  more  to  the  northwest  of  the  Korean 
Peninsula,  perhaps  near  Beijing.  This  theory,  however,  has  not 
been  universally  accepted.)  Until  the  Han  period,  the  Korean 
Peninsula  had  been  a  veritable  Chinese  colony.  During  some  400 
years,  Lolang,  the  core  of  the  colony,  had  become  a  great  center 
of  Chinese  art,  philosophy,  industry,  and  commerce.  Many  Chinese 
immigrated  into  the  area;  the  influence  of  China  extended 
beyond  the  territory  it  administered.  The  tribal  states  south  of  the 
Han  River  paid  tribute  to  the  Chinese  and  patterned  much  of  their 
civilization  and  government  after  Chinese  models. 

The  Three  Kingdoms  Period 

The  territory  south  of  the  Han  River  is  relatively  distant  from 
the  Asian  continent;  hence,  the  people  living  there  were  initially 
able  to  develop  independently,  without  much  involvement  with 
events  on  the  continent.  The  early  settlers  of  this  region  gradually 
organized  themselves  into  some  seventy  clan  states  that  were  in 
turn  grouped  into  three  tribal  confederations  known  as  Chinhan, 
Mahan,  and  Pyonhan.  Chinhan  was  situated  in  the  middle  part  of 


4 


Historical  Setting 


the  peninsula,  Mahan  in  the  southwest,  and  Pyonhan  in  the 
southeast.  Their  economies  were  predominantly  agricultural,  and 
their  level  of  development  was  such  that  they  built  reservoirs  and 
irrigation  facilities.  These  tribal  states  began  to  be  affected  by  what 
was  happening  in  the  region  north  of  the  Han  River  around  the 
first  century  B.C. 

About  the  middle  of  the  third  century  A.D.,  the  Chinese  threat 
began  to  serve  as  a  unifying  political  force  among  the  loose  con- 
federations of  tribes  in  the  southern  part  of  the  peninsula.  Adopt- 
ing the  Chinese  political  system  as  a  model,  the  tribes  eventually 
merged  into  two  kingdoms,  thereby  increasing  their  chances  of  sur- 
vival against  Chinese  expansionism.  The  two  kingdoms  eventually 
came  to  play  an  important  role  in  Korean  history. 

Geographic  features  of  the  southern  parts  of  the  land,  in  partic- 
ular the  configuration  of  mountain  ranges,  caused  two  kingdoms 
to  emerge  rather  than  one.  In  the  central  part  of  Korea,  the  main 
mountain  range,  the  T'aebaek  Range,  runs  north  to  south  along 
the  edge  of  the  Sea  of  Japan,  which  lies  off  the  east  coast  of  the 
peninsula.  Approximately  three-fourths  of  the  way  down  the  penin- 
sula, however,  at  roughly  the  thirty- seventh  parallel,  the  moun- 
tain range  veers  southwest,  dividing  the  peninsula  almost  in  the 
middle.  This  extension,  the  Sobaek  Range,  proved  politically  sig- 
nificant; the  tribes  west  of  it  were  not  shielded  by  any  natural  bar- 
riers against  the  Chinese-occupied  portion  of  the  peninsula,  whereas 
those  to  the  southeast  were  protected.  Moreover,  the  presence  of 
the  mountains  prevented  the  tribes  in  the  two  regions  from  estab- 
lishing close  contacts. 

The  tribal  states  in  the  southwest  were  the  first  to  unite,  calling 
their  centralized  kingdom  Paekche.  This  process  occurred  in  the 
mid-third  century  A.D.,  after  the  Chinese  army  of  the  Wei  Dy- 
nasty (A.D.  220-65),  which  controlled  Lolang,  threatened  the  tribes 
in  A.D.  245.  The  Silla  Kingdom  evolved  in  the  southeast.  Silla 
historians  traced  the  kingdom's  origin  to  57  B.C.,  but  contemporary 
historians  regard  King  Naemul  (A.D.  356-402)  as  having  been  the 
earliest  ruler.  Some  of  the  tribal  states  in  the  area  of  the  lower  Nak- 
tong  River,  along  the  south  central  coast  of  the  peninsula,  did  not 
join  either  of  these  kingdoms.  Under  the  name  Kaya,  they  formed 
a  league  of  walled  city-states  that  conducted  extensive  coastal  trade 
and  also  maintained  close  ties  with  the  tribal  states  in  western  Japan. 
Sandwiched  between  the  more  powerful  Silla  and  Paekche,  Kaya 
eventually  was  absorbed  by  its  neighbors  during  the  sixth  century 
(see  fig.  2). 

The  northern  kingdom  of  Koguryo  emerged  from  among  the 
indigenous  people  along  the  banks  of  the  Yalu  River.  The  Han

Chinese  seized  the  area  in  108  B.C.,  but  from  the  beginning 
Chinese  rulers  confronted  many  uprisings  against  their  rule.  Start- 
ing from  a  point  along  the  Hun  River  (a  tributary  of  the  Yalu), 
the  rebels  expanded  their  activities  to  the  north,  south,  and 
southeast,  increasingly  menacing  Chinese  authority.  By  A.D.  53 
Koguryo  had  coalesced  into  an  independent  centralized  kingdom; 
the  subsequent  fall  of  the  Han  Dynasty  and  ensuing  political  divi- 
sions in  China  enabled  Koguryo  to  consolidate  and  extend  its  power. 
Despite  repeated  attacks  by  Chinese  and  other  opposition  forces, 
by  391  the  kingdom's  rulers  had  achieved  undisputed  control  of 
all  of  Manchuria  east  of  the  Liao  River  as  well  as  of  the  northern 
and  central  regions  of  the  Korean  Peninsula.  Koguryo 's  best-known 
ruler,  King  Kwanggaet'o — whose  name  literally  means  "broad  ex- 
pander of  territory" — lived  to  be  only  thirty-nine  years  of  age,  but 
reigned  twenty-one  years,  from  391  to  412.  During  that  period, 
Kwanggaet'o  conquered  65  walled  cities  and  1,400  villages,  in  ad- 
dition to  aiding  Silla  when  it  was  attacked  by  the  Japanese.  His 
accomplishments  are  recorded  on  a  monument  erected  in  414  in 
southern  Manchuria.  Koguryo  moved  its  capital  to  P'yongyang  in 
427  and  ruled  the  territory  north  of  the  Han  River.  But  Koguryo 's

expansion  caused  it  to  come  into  conflict  with  the  Sui  Dynasty  of 
China  (581-617)  in  the  west  and  Silla,  which  was  beginning  to  ex- 
pand northward,  in  the  south. 

Although  Koguryo  had  been  strong  enough  to  repulse  the  forces 
of  the  Sui  Dynasty,  combined  attacks  by  Silla  and  the  Tang  Dy- 
nasty of  China  (618-907)  proved  too  formidable.  Koguryo' s  ally 
in  the  southwest,  Paekche,  fell  before  Tang  and  Silla  in  660;  the 
victorious  allies  continued  their  assault  on  Koguryo  for  the  next 
eight  years  and  eventually  vanquished  the  weary  kingdom,  which 
had  been  suffering  from  a  series  of  famines  and  internal  strife. 

Silla  thus  unified  Korea  in  668,  but  the  kingdom's  reliance  on 
China's  Tang  Dynasty  had  its  price.  Eventually  Silla  had  to  forcibly 
resist  the  imposition  of  Chinese  rule  over  the  entire  peninsula,  which 
Silla' s  rulers  did,  but  their  strength  did  not  extend  beyond  the  Tae- 
dong  River.  Much  of  the  former  Koguryo  territory  was  given  up 
to  the  Chinese  and  to  other  tribal  states.  It  remained  for  later  dy- 
nasties to  push  the  border  northward  to  the  Yalu  and  Tumen  rivers. 

The  Evolution  of  Korean  Society 

After  the  Three  Kingdoms  period,  Korea  witnessed  the  rise  and 
fall  of  three  dynasties— unified  Silla  (668-935),  Koryo  (918-1392), 
and  Choson  (1392-1910).  Each  of  these  dynasties  was  marked  by 
initial  periods  of  consolidation,  the  flourishing  of  civilization,  and 
eventual  decline. 

Silla 

The  first  215  years  of  the  Silla  Dynasty  were  marked  by  the  estab- 
lishment of  new  political,  legal,  and  education  institutions  of  con- 
siderable vigor.  Domestic  and  foreign  trade  (with  Tang  China  and 
Japan)  prospered.  Scholarship  in  Confucian  learning,  mathematics, 
astronomy,  and  medicine  also  flourished.  Buddhism,  introduced  to 
the  peninsula  in  A.D.  372,  reached  its  zenith  (see  Religion,  ch.  2). 

Silla  began  to  decline,  however,  in  the  latter  part  of  the  eighth 
century  when  rebellions  began  to  shake  its  foundations.  By  the  latter 
half  of  the  ninth  century,  two  rivals  had  emerged.  The  chaotic  sit- 
uation eventually  led  to  the  emergence  of  a  new  Koryo  Dynasty 
in  918  under  a  former  officer,  Wang  Kon. 

KoryO 

The  founder  of  Koryo  and  his  heirs  consolidated  control  over 
the  peninsula  and  strengthened  its  political  and  economic  founda- 
tions by  more  closely  following  the  bureaucratic  and  land- grant 
systems  of  Tang  China.  The  rise  of  the  Kitan  Liao  tribe  in  the 
north,  however,  threatened  the  new  dynasty.  The  Liao  invaded 


7

in  1010;  Koryo  was  engulfed  in  devastating  wars  for  a  decade.  After 
peace  was  restored,  Koryo' s  inhabitants  witnessed  nearly  a  century 
of  thriving  commercial,  intellectual,  and  artistic  activities  parallel 
to  those  taking  place  under  the  Song  Dynasty  (960-1279)  in  China. 
The  Koryo  leaders  actively  sought  to  imitate  the  Song's  advanced 
culture  and  technology.  In  turn,  the  Song  looked  upon  Koryo  as 
a  potential  ally  against  the  tribal  invaders  to  whom  it  had  been 
forced  to  abandon  northern  China  in  1127.  Stimulated  by  the  rise 
of  printing  in  Song  China,  Koryo  also  made  great  headway  in  print- 
ing and  publication,  leading  to  the  invention  of  movable  metal  type 
in  1234,  two  centuries  before  the  introduction  of  movable  type  in 
Europe. 

By  the  twelfth  century,  Koryo  was  plagued  by  internal  and  ex- 
ternal problems.  Power  struggles  and  avariciousness  among  the 
ruling  classes  led  to  revolts  by  their  subjects.  The  situation  was  ag- 
gravated by  the  rise  in  the  north  of  the  Mongols,  who  launched 
a  massive  invasion  in  1231.  The  Koryo  armies  put  up  fierce 
resistance  but  were  no  match  for  the  highly  organized  mounted 
troops  from  the  north,  whose  forces  swept  most  of  the  Eurasian 
continent  during  this  period. 

The  Mongol  Empire  under  Khubilai  Khan  enlisted  Koryo  in 
its  expeditions  against  Japan,  mustering  thousands  of  Korean  men 
and  ships  for  ill-fated  invasions  in  1274  and  1281 .  In  each  instance, 
seasonal  typhoons  shattered  the  Mongol-Koryo  fleets,  giving  rise 
to  the  myth  of  kamikaze,  or  the  "  divine  wind."  Korea,  in  the  mean- 
time, was  completely  under  Mongol  domination.  Koryo  kings  mar- 
ried Mongol  princesses.  Only  in  the  early  fourteenth  century,  when 
the  Mongol  Empire  began  to  disintegrate  and  the  Ming  Dynasty 
(1368-1644) — founded  by  a  former  Chinese  peasant — pushed  the 
Mongols  back  to  the  north,  did  Koryo  regain  its  independence. 
In  1359  and  1361,  however,  Koryo  suffered  invasions  by  a  large 
number  of  Chinese  rebel  armies,  known  as  the  Red  Banner  Ban- 
dits, who  sacked  and  burned  the  capital  at  Kaesong,  just  north  of 
the  mouth  of  the  Han  River.  The  country  was  left  in  ruins. 

As  the  Mongols  retreated  to  the  north  and  the  Ming  established 
a  garrison  in  the  northeastern  part  of  the  Korean  Peninsula,  the 
Koryo  court  was  torn  between  pro-Ming  and  pro-Mongol  factions. 
General  Yi  Song-gye,  who  had  been  sent  to  attack  the  Ming  forces 
in  the  Liaodong  region  of  Manchuria,  revolted  at  the  Yalu  and 
turned  his  army  against  his  own  capital,  seizing  it  with  ease.  Yi  took 
the  throne  in  1392,  founding  Korea's  most  enduring  dynasty.  The 
new  state  was  named  Choson,  the  same  name  used  by  the  first 
Korean  kingdom  fifteen  centuries  earlier,  although  the  later  entity

usually  has  been  called  simply  the  Choson  Dynasty  or  the  Yi  Dy- 
nasty. The  capital  of  Choson  was  at  Seoul. 

The  ChosOn  Dynasty 

The  Koryo  Dynasty  had  suffered  from  a  number  of  internal 
problems;  Yi  and  his  followers  implemented  drastic  reforms  to  place 
the  new  dynasty  on  firmer  ground.  One  of  these  problems  revolved 
around  the  deterioration  of  land  administration,  a  basic  issue  in 
a  predominantly  agrarian  society.  Contrary  to  the  law  specifying 
public  (governmental)  ownership  of  land,  powerful  clans  and  Bud- 
dhist temples  had  acquired  a  sizable  proportion  of  farmland.  By 
exacting  a  disproportionate  share  of  crops  in  the  form  of  rents,  the 
"landlords"  were  causing  economic  destitution  and  social  discon- 
tent among  the  peasants.  By  illicitly  removing  the  farms  from  tax 
rolls,  these  clans  and  temples  reduced  the  government's  income, 
thus  straining  the  treasury.  Yi  had  sided  with  reformists  even  be- 
fore he  took  power,  hence  it  was  natural  for  him  to  rectify  past 
inequities  after  ascending  to  the  throne. 

The  reform  of  the  land  system,  however,  had  direct  repercus- 
sions on  the  practice  of  Buddhism  because  Buddhist  temples  and 
monks  had  been  among  those  exacerbating  the  land  problem.  The 
economic  influence  of  the  temples  was  eliminated  when  they  lost 
vast  lands.  The  rectification  went  beyond  economic  reform, 
however,  because  the  dominant  forces  in  the  new  dynasty  were 


9 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

devout  Confucianists  who  regarded  Buddhism  as  a  false  creed.  The 
fact  that  Buddhist  monks  had  wielded  a  strong  influence  in  poli- 
tics, the  economy,  and  society  during  the  latter  part  of  the  Koryo 
Dynasty — and  that  many  of  them  had  been  corrupted  by  power 
and  money — strengthened  the  opposition  to  Buddhism.  Accord- 
ingly, the  new  dynasty  launched  a  sweeping  attack  on  Buddhism 
and  its  institutions,  an  attack  that  had  profound  and  enduring  ef- 
fects on  the  character  of  civilization  on  the  peninsula. 

Many  of  the  outstanding  temples  were  permitted  to  remain  in- 
tact; indeed,  a  few  Choson  monarchs  were  devout  Buddhists. 
Nevertheless,  Buddhism  exerted  little  influence  over  the  religious 
life  of  Korea  under  the  Choson  Dynasty;  nor  did  any  organized 
religion  replace  it.  Although  many  people  adhered  to  shamanism, 
geomancy,  fortunetelling,  and  superstitions,  Korea  effectively  be- 
came a  secular  society. 

The  Choson  Dynasty  had  an  auspicious  beginning.  During  the 
reign  of  the  fourth  monarch,  King  Sejong  (1418-50),  a  Buddhist, 
enormous  strides  were  made  in  the  arts,  science,  and  technology. 
The  Korean  script,  known  as  han'gul  (see  Glossary),  which  even- 
tually came  into  common  usage  in  the  twentieth  century,  was  de- 
veloped by  scholars  at  that  time. 

After  Sejong,  however,  the  dynasty  fell  into  the  hands  of  lesser 
men,  and  in  the  late  fifteenth  century  the  country  began  a  long 
decline.  Succession  to  the  throne  often  caused  long  and  bitter  strug- 
gles, particularly  when  a  ruler  did  not  leave  behind  an  heir  who 
had  reached  the  age  of  majority.  Members  of  the  Confucian- 
educated,  scholar-official  elite  yangban  (see  Glossary)  class  quarreled 
over  minor  points  of  Confucian  ritual  and  etiquette,  especially  the 
proper  period  of  mourning  upon  the  death  of  a  royal  personage. 
Factional  groups  began  vying  for  power,  frequently  going  to  the 
extreme  of  exterminating  the  members  of  defeated  factions.  The 
civil  service  examination  became  a  sham,  and  corruption  ran  ram- 
pant. Royal  relatives  and  members  of  powerful  factions  increased 
their  landholdings,  which  became  exempt  from  taxes  and  thereby 
reduced  the  dynasty's  sources  of  revenue.  The  farmers  suffered 
more  and  more  from  tax  burdens  and  other  extractions  imposed 
by  greedy  officials  and  landlords.  In  short,  the  country  was  not 
being  effectively  governed.  To  make  matters  worse,  Japanese  at- 
tacks in  1592  and  1597  and  Manchu  assaults  in  1627  and  1636 
ravaged  the  country's  economy  and  turned  much  of  the  farmland 
to  waste  for  a  long  period  thereafter. 

The  resulting  social  and  economic  depression  of  the  seventeenth 
and  eighteenth  centuries  fostered  the  rise  of  a  new  intellectual  move- 
ment advocating  the  practical  use  of  human  knowledge.  Pioneered 


10 


Historical  Setting 


by  a  Confucian  scholar  named  Yi  Su-kwang,  the  new  thought — 
soon  to  be  called  Sirhak  (practical  learning) — was  partly  inspired 
by  the  firsthand  knowledge  of  occidental  sciences  that  Yi  Su-kwang 
had  acquired  while  on  official  visits  to  Beijing.  As  historian  Ki- 
baik  Lee  has  noted,  Sirhak  thought  encompassed  a  variety  of  in- 
tellectual activities  and  several  diverse  viewpoints.  These  included 
proposals  for  refinement  of  the  traditional  administrative  and  land 
systems,  advocacy  of  commercial  and  manufacturing  activity,  and 
a  renewed  interest  in  Korean  history  and  language.  Brought  to 
maturity  in  the  late  eighteenth  century  by  Chong  Yag-yong,  the  Sir- 
hak Movement  was  supported  by  a  group  of  discontented  schol- 
ars, petty  officials,  former  bureaucrats,  and  commoners. 

The  Sirhak  Movement  found  itself  in  direct  confrontation  with 
the  dominant  trend  in  neo-Confucian  thought,  which  stressed  the 
metaphysical  and  abstract  teachings  of  the  renowned  Chinese 
philosopher  Zhu  Xi  (see  Traditional  Social  Structure,  ch.  2).  Nei- 
ther the  efforts  of  such  wise  and  able  kings  as  Yongjo  (1725-75)  and 
Chongjo  (1776-1800),  nor  those  of  the  Sirhak  scholars,  were  able  to 
reverse  the  trend  against  empirical  studies  and  good  government. 

Western  ideas,  including  Christianity,  reached  Korea  through 
China  in  the  seventeenth  century.  By  1785,  however,  the  govern- 
ment had  become  incensed  over  the  rejection  of  ancestor  worship 
by  Roman  Catholic  missionaries,  and  it  banned  all  forms  of  Western 
learning.  Western  ships  began  to  approach  Korean  shores  after 
1801,  seeking  trade  and  other  contacts,  but  the  government  rejected 
all  overtures  from  abroad.  When  news  of  the  Opium  War  in  China 
(1839-42)  reached  Korea,  the  dynasty  had  all  the  more  reason  to 
shut  the  doors  tighdy  against  Western  "barbarians."  In  the  mean- 
time, the  Choson  Dynasty  suffered  from  a  series  of  natural  calam- 
ities including  floods,  famines,  and  epidemics,  as  well  as  large-scale 
revolts  of  the  masses  in  the  northwest  (1811-12)  and  southwest  (1862 
and  1894-95). 

The  expansion  of  Western  powers  in  East  Asia  in  the  nineteenth 
century  significantly  altered  the  established  order,  in  which  Korea 
had  been  dominated  by  China.  China  under  the  Qing  Dynasty 
(1644-191 1)  was  in  decline;  its  power  waned  rapidly  under  the  con- 
certed attacks  of  such  Western  nations  as  France,  Britain,  and  Rus- 
sia. Stimulated  by  these  events,  Japan  proceeded  to  modernize  after 
having  been  forced  to  open  its  ports  by  Commodore  Matthew  C. 
Perry  of  the  United  States  Navy  in  1853-54.  Korea,  however,  re- 
mained dormant,  having  closed  itself  to  all  outside  contacts  in  the 
early  eighteenth  century. 

The  Japanese  were  the  first  foreign  power  in  recent  history  to 
succeed  in  penetrating  Korea's  isolation.  After  a  warlike  Japanese 


11

provocation  against  Korea  in  1875  (when  China  failed  to  come  to 
Korea's  aid),  the  Japanese  forced  an  unequal  treaty  on  Korea  in 
February  1876.  The  treaty  gave  Japanese  nationals  extraterritorial 
rights  and  opened  up  three  Korean  ports  to  Japanese  trade.  In  retali- 
ation, China  sought  to  counter  Japan  by  extending  Korea's  exter- 
nal relations  and  playing  off  one  Western  power  against  another. 
Accordingly,  Korea  signed  treaties  with  the  United  States,  Britain, 
Italy,  Russia,  and  other  countries  within  the  decade  after  the  one 
with  Japan. 

Internally,  the  Korean  court  split  into  rival  pro- Chinese,  pro- 
Japanese,  and  pro-Russian  factions,  the  latter  two  having  more 
reformist  and  modernizing  orientations.  In  1895  the  Japanese 
minister  to  Korea  masterminded  the  assassination  of  the  Korean 
queen,  who  with  her  clan  had  opposed  reform-oriented,  Japanese- 
supported  leaders.  The  Korean  king,  however,  rejected  not  only 
Japan  but  also  the  various  reform  measures  and  turned  for  sup- 
port to  one  of  Japan's  adversaries — Russia.  The  king  fled  to  the 
Russian  legation  in  Seoul  to  avoid  possible  Japanese  plots  against 
him  and  conducted  the  nation's  business  from  there.  The  Japanese 
blunder  had  served  the  Russians  well. 

In  the  meantime,  under  the  leadership  of  So  Chae-p'il,  who  had 
exiled  himself  to  the  United  States  after  participating  in  an  unsuc- 
cessful palace  coup  in  1884,  a  massive  campaign  was  launched  to 
advocate  Korean  independence  from  foreign  influence  and  con- 
trols. As  well  as  supporting  Korean  independence,  So  also  advo- 
cated reform  in  Korea's  politics  and  customs  in  line  with  Western 
practices.  Upon  his  return  to  Korea  in  1896,  So  published  Tong- 
nip  simmun  (The  Independent),  the  first  newspaper  to  use  the  han- 
gul  writing  system  and  the  vernacular  language,  which  attracted 
an  ever-growing  audience  (see  The  Korean  Language,  ch.  2).  He 
also  organized  the  Independence  Club  to  introduce  Korea's  elite 
to  Western  ideas  and  practices.  Under  his  impetus  and  the  influence 
of  education  provided  by  Protestant  mission  schools,  hundreds  of 
young  men  held  mass  meetings  on  the  streets  and  plazas  demand- 
ing democratic  reforms  and  an  end  to  Russian  and  Japanese  domi- 
nation. But  the  conservative  forces  proved  to  be  too  deeply 
entrenched  for  the  progressive  reformers,  who  trashed  the  paper's 
offices.  The  reformers,  including  Syngman  Rhee,  then  a  student 
leader,  were  jailed.  So  was  compelled  to  return  to  the  United  States 
in  1898,  and  under  one  pretext  or  another  the  government  sup- 
pressed both  the  reform  movement  and  its  newspaper. 

The  revolt  of  1894-95,  known  as  the  Tonghak  Rebellion,  had 
international  repercussions.  Like  the  Taiping  rebels  in  China  thirty 
years  earlier,  the  Tonghak  (see  Glossary)  participants  were  fired

by  religious  fervor  as  well  as  by  indignation  about  the  corrupt  and 
oppressive  government.  The  rebellion  spread  from  the  southwest 
to  the  central  region  of  the  peninsula,  menacing  Seoul.  The  Korean 
court  apparendy  felt  unable  to  cope  with  the  rebels  and  invited  Chi- 
na to  send  troops  to  quell  the  rebellion.  This  move  gave  Japan  a 
pretext  to  dispatch  troops  to  Korea.  The  two  countries  soon  en- 
gaged in  the  First  Sino-Japanese  War  (1894-95),  which  accelerat- 
ed the  demise  of  the  Qing  Dynasty  in  China. 

The  victorious  Japanese  established  their  hegemony  over  Korea 
via  the  Treaty  of  Shimonoseki  (1895)  and  dictated  to  the  Korean 
government  a  wide-ranging  series  of  measures  to  prevent  further 
domestic  disturbances.  In  response,  the  government  promulgated 
various  reforms,  including  the  abolition  of  class  distinctions,  the 
liberation  of  slaves,  the  abolition  of  the  ritualistic  civil  service  ex- 
amination system,  and  the  adoption  of  a  new  tax  system. 

Russian  influence  had  been  on  the  rise  in  East  Asia,  in  direct 
conflict  with  the  Japanese  desire  for  expansion.  In  alliance  with 
France  and  Germany,  Russia  had  just  forced  Japan  to  return  the 
Liaodong  Peninsula  to  China  (which  Japan  had  seized  during  the 
First  Sino-Japanese  War)  and  then  promptly  leased  the  territory 
from  China.  The  secret  Sino-Russian  treaty  signed  in  1896  also 
gave  the  Russians  the  right  to  build  and  operate  the  Chinese  Eastern 
Railway  across  northern  Manchuria,  which  served  as  a  link  in  the 
Russian  Trans-Siberian  Railway  to  Vladivostok.  Russia  proceed- 
ed to  acquire  numerous  concessions  over  Korea's  forests  and  mines. 

The  strategic  rivalry  between  Russia  and  Japan  exploded  in  the 
Russo-Japanese  War  of  1904-5,  won  by  Japan.  Under  the  peace 
treaty  signed  in  September  1905,  Russia  acknowledged  Japan's 
'  'paramount  political,  military,  and  economic  interest"  in  Korea. 
A  separate  agreement  signed  in  secret  between  the  United  States 
and  Japan  at  this  time  subsequentiy  aroused  anti- American  senti- 
ment among  Koreans.  The  Taft-Katsura  Agreement  was  cynical 
by  modern  standards,  exchanging  what  amounted  to  a  lack  of  in- 
terest and  military  capability  in  Korea  on  the  part  of  the  United 
States  (Japan  was  given  a  free  hand  in  Korea)  for  a  lack  of  interest 
or  capability  in  the  Philippines  on  the  part  of  Japan  (Japanese  im- 
perialism was  diverted  from  the  Philippines).  Given  the  diplomatic 
conventions  of  the  times,  however,  the  agreement  was  a  much  weak- 
er endorsement  of  the  Japanese  presence  in  Korea  than  either  the 
Russo-Japanese  peace  treaty  or  a  separate  Anglo-Japanese  accord. 
Two  months  later,  Korea  was  obliged  to  become  a  Japanese  pro- 
tectorate. Thereafter,  a  large  number  of  Koreans  organized  them- 
selves in  education  and  reform  movements,  but  by  then  Japanese

dominance  in  Korea  was  a  reality.  Japan  annexed  Korea  as  a  colony 
on  August  22,  1910. 

Characteristics  of  Society  under  the  Dynasties 
Cultural  Expression 

Koreans,  like  the  other  East  Asian  peoples,  have  a  highly  devel- 
oped aesthetic  sense  and  over  the  centuries  have  created  a  great 
number  of  paintings,  sculptures,  and  handicrafts  of  extraordinary 
beauty.  Among  the  very  earliest  are  the  paintings  found  on  the 
walls  of  tombs  of  the  Koguryo  Kingdom  (located  in  what  is  now 
North  Korea)  and  around  the  China-North  Korea  border  area. 
These  paintings  are  colorful  representations  of  birds,  animals,  and 
human  figures  that  possess  remarkable  vitality  and  animation.  Simi- 
lar, though  less  spectacular,  tombs  are  found  around  the  old  capi- 
tals of  the  kingdoms  of  Paekche  and  Silla  in  present-day  South 
Korea.  A  number  of  gold  objects,  including  a  gold  crown  of  great 
delicacy  and  sophistication  dating  from  the  Three  Kingdoms  period, 
have  been  found  in  South  Korea. 

Buddhism  was  the  dominant  artistic  influence  during  the  later 
Three  Kingdoms  period  and  the  Silla  and  Koryo  dynasties.  Themes 
and  motifs  that  had  originated  in  India  passed  to  Korea  through 
Central  Asia  and  China.  A  number  of  bronze  images  of  Buddha 
and  the  Bodhisattvas  were  made  during  the  sixth,  seventh,  and 
eighth  centuries.  The  images  are  not  mere  copies  of  Indian  or  north 
Chinese  models,  but  possess  a  distinctly  ' 'Korean"  spirit  that  one 
critic  has  described  as  4 'as  indifference  to  sophistication  and  ar- 
tificiality and  a  predisposition  toward  nature."  The  striking  stone 
Buddha  found  in  the  Sokkuram  Grotto,  a  cave  temple  located  near 
Kyongju  in  North  Kyongsang  Province,  was  carved  during  the  Silla 
Dynasty  and  is  considered  to  be  the  finest  of  Korean  stone  carvings. 
During  the  centuries  of  Buddhism's  ascendancy,  a  large  number 
of  stone  pagodas  and  temples  were  built,  one  of  the  most  famous 
being  the  Pulguksa  Temple  near  Koyngju. 

The  Koryo  Dynasty  is  best  remembered  for  its  celadons,  or 
bluish- green  porcelains,  considered  by  many  specialists  to  be  the 
best  in  the  world,  surpassing  even  the  Chinese  porcelains  upon 
which  they  were  originally  modeled.  Many  have  intricate  designs 
of  birds,  flowers,  and  other  figures  rendered  in  light  and  dark- 
colored  clay  on  the  blue-green  background;  some  are  delicately 
formed  into  the  shapes  of  flowers,  animals,  and  objects.  Choson 
Dynasty  pottery  tended  to  be  simpler  and  more  rustic  and  had  a 
great  influence  on  the  development  of  Japanese  artistic  appreciation 
from  the  late  sixteenth  century  on.  After  the  attempted  Japanese 


15 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

invasions  of  Korea  in  the  1590s,  Korean  potters  were  taken  back 
to  Japan. 

During  the  Choson  Dynasty,  Buddhism  was  no  longer  a  source 
of  artistic  inspiration.  The  art,  music,  and  literature  of  the yangban 
were  deeply  influenced  by  Chinese  models,  yet  exhibited  a  distinc- 
tively Korean  style.  Korean  scholar-officials  cultivated  their  skills 
in  the  arts  of  Confucian  culture — Chinese  poetry,  calligraphy,  and 
landscape  painting.  Poetry  was  considered  to  be  the  most  impor- 
tant of  these  arts;  men  who  lacked  poetic  ability  could  not  pass  the 
civil  service  examinations.  Scholars  were  expected  to  refine  their 
skill  in  using  the  brush  both  in  calligraphy,  the  ornamental  writ- 
ing of  Chinese  characters  that  was  considered  an  art  in  itself,  and 
in  landscape  painting,  which  borrowed  Chinese  themes  and  styles. 
However,  scholarly  calligraphers  and  landscape  painters  were  con- 
sidered amateurs.  Professional  artists  were  members  of  the  chung- 
in  (see  Glossary)  class  and  were  of  low  status,  not  only  because  their 
painting  tended  to  diverge  from  the  style  favored  by  the  upper  class 
but  because  it  was  too  realistic.  Particularly  among  the  yangban, 
Chinese  dominance  of  cultural  expression  was  assured  by  the  fact 
that  Korean  intellectual  discourse  was  largely  dependent  on  Chinese 
loanwords.  Scholars  preferred  to  write  in  Chinese  rather  than  in 
native  Korean  script. 

One  uniquely  Korean  style  of  painting  that  developed  during 
this  period  was  found  in  the  usually  anonymous  folk-paintings  (min- 
hwa),  which  depicted  the  daily  life  of  the  common  people  and  used 
genuine  Korean  rather  than  idealized  or  Chinese  settings.  Other 
folk  paintings  had  shamanistic  themes  and  frequentiy  depicted  her- 
mits and  mountain  deities. 

A  distinctive  position  in  traditional  Korean  literature  is  occupied 
by  a  type  of  poem  known  as  the  sijo — a  poetic  form  that  began  to 
develop  in  the  twelfth  century.  It  is  composed  of  three  couplets  and 
characterized  by  great  simplicity  and  expressiveness: 

My  body  is  mortal,  commonly  mortal. 
My  bones  end  in  dust,  soul  or  no  soul. 
My  lord  owns  my  heart,  though,  and  that  cannot 
change. 

This  poem  is  by  Chong  Mong-ju  (1337-92),  a  Koryo  Dynasty 
loyalist  who  was  assassinated  at  the  foundation  of  the  Yi  Dynasty. 
The  poet  refers  to  his  political  choice  not  to  side  with  the  new 
government. 

Many  of  these  poems  reveal  a  sensitivity  to  the  beauties  of  na- 
ture, delight  in  life's  pleasures,  and  a  tendency  toward  philosophical 


16 


Historical  Setting 


contemplation  that  together  produce  a  sense  of  serenity  and,  some- 
times, loneliness.  Frequently  the  poems  reveal  a  preoccupation  with 
purity,  symbolized  by  whiteness: 

Do  not  enter,  snowy  heron,  in  the  valley  where  the 

crows  are  quarreling. 
Such  angry  crows  are  envious  of  your  whiteness, 
And  I  fear  that  they  will  soil  the  body  you  have 

washed  in  the  pure  stream. 

The  development  of  a  Korean  alphabet  (today  known  as  han  'gul) 
in  the  fifteenth  century  gave  rise  to  a  vernacular,  or  popular,  liter- 
ature. Although  the  native  alphabet  was  looked  down  upon  by  the 
yangban  elite,  historical  works,  poetry,  travelogues,  biographies,  and 
fiction  written  in  a  mixed  script  of  Chinese  characters  and  han  'gul 
were  widely  circulated.  Some  vernacular  literature  had  what  could 
be  interpreted  as  social  protest  themes.  Probably  the  earliest  of  these 
was  The  Tale  of  Hong  Kil-tong  hy  Ho  Kyun.  The  protagonist,  Hong 
Kil-tong,  was  the  son  of  a  nobleman  and  his  concubine;  his  ambi- 
tion to  become  a  great  official  was  frustrated  because  of  his  mother's 
lowly  background.  He  became  a  Robin  Hood  figure,  stole  from 
the  rich  to  give  to  the  poor,  and  eventually  left  Korea  in  order  to 
establish  a  small  kingdom  in  the  south.  Other  vernacular  writers 
included  Kim  Man-jung,  who  wrote  The  Nine  Cloud  Dream,  which 
dealt  with  Buddhist  themes  of  karma  and  destiny,  and  The  Story 
of  Lady  Sa.  Pak  Chi-won's  Tale  of  a  Yangban  gave  a  realistic  account 
of  social  life  in  eighteenth- century  Korea.  In  1980  Korean  schol- 
ars discovered  a  nineteenth-century  vernacular  novel  that  told  of 
the  complicated  relationships  among  members  of  four  yangban  and 
commoner  clans  over  five  generations  in  a  very  detailed  and  realistic 
manner.  At  235  volumes,  this  work  is  one  of  the  longest  novels 
ever  written. 

P'ansori  combine  music  and  literary  expression  in  ballad-form 
stories,  which  are  both  recited  and  sung  by  a  performer  accompa- 
nied by  a  drummer  who  sets  the  rhythms — a  kind  of  "one-man 
opera"  in  the  words  of  one  observer.  P'ansori  usually  are  inspired 
by  myths  or  folk  tales  and  have  Confucian,  Buddhist,  or  folkloric 
themes.  In  the  1970s  and  1980s,  dissident  students  often  drew  on 
the  techniques  of  traditional  folk  drama  to  satirize  contemporary 
politics. 

Korean  folk  tales  are  closely  tied  to  religious  traditions  and  usually 
have  shamanistic,  Buddhist,  or  Confucian  themes.  While  Confucian 
tales  tend  to  be  moralistic  and  didactic,  Buddhist  and  shamanistic 
tales  are  highly  imaginative  and  colorful,  depicting  the  relationships

among  spirits,  ghosts,  gods,  and  men  in  many  different  and  often 
humorous  ways. 

Korean  Identity 

That  the  Korean  kingdoms  were  strongly  affected  by  Chinese 
civilization  and  its  institutions  was  not  surprising.  Not  only  were 
the  Chinese  far  more  numerous  and  often  more  powerful  militarily 
than  the  Koreans,  but  they  also  had  a  more  advanced  technology 
and  culture.  Chinese  supremacy  in  these  realms  was  acknowledged 
not  only  by  the  Koreans,  who  were  militarily  inferior,  but  also  by 
those  who  were  powerful  enough  to  conquer  China,  such  as  the 
Kitan  Liao,  who  ruled  parts  of  northern  China,  Manchuria,  and 
Mongolia  between  907  and  1127;  the  Mongols  who  ruled  China 
from  1279  to  1368;  the  Jurchen  tribes,  who  later  seized  northern 
Manchuria;  and  the  Manchus,  who  ruled  China  between  1644  and 
1911.  The  adoption  of  Chinese  culture  was  more  than  simply  an 
expression  of  submission  to  China,  it  also  was  the  indispensable 
condition  of  being  civilized  in  the  East  Asian  context.  This  situa- 
tion continued  until  the  inroads  of  Western  civilization  substan- 
tially altered  the  political  and  cultural  map  of  Asia  in  the  latter  part 
of  the  nineteenth  century. 

The  adoption  of  Chinese  culture  and  institutions  by  the  Korean 
kingdoms,  however,  did  not  obliterate  the  identity  of  the  Korean 
people.  Koguryo  had  risen  against  the  Chinese  conquerors,  and 
Silla  had  stubbornly  resisted  Chinese  attempts  to  turn  it  into  a 
colony.  While  Silla  and  subsequent  dynasties  were  obliged  to  pay 
tribute  to  the  various  Chinese,  Mongol,  and  Jurchen  dynasties, 
and  although  Korea  was  subjected  to  direct  overlordship  by  the 
Mongols  for  a  century,  the  Korean  kingdoms  were  able  to  survive 
as  independent  entities,  enabling  their  citizens  to  maintain  an  iden- 
tity as  a  separate  people. 

Further  contributing  to  the  maintenance  of  this  identity  was  the 
Korean  language,  which  linguists  generally  agree  belongs  to  the 
Altaic  language  family  of  Inner  Asia.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the 
indigenous  language  was  deeply  affected  by  the  country's  long  con- 
tact with  China.  Not  only  did  its  written  form  rely  on  Chinese 
characters  until  the  fifteenth  century,  but  about  half  of  its  vocabu- 
lary was  of  Chinese  origin.  Nevertheless,  the  language  is  very  differ- 
ent from  Chinese  in  its  lexicon,  phonology,  and  grammar.  Although 
at  one  time  the  ruling  classes  were  set  apart  from  the  rest  of  the 
population  by  their  knowledge  of  Chinese  characters  and  their  abil- 
ity to  use  Chinese  in  its  written  form,  since  the  unification  of  the 
peninsula  by  the  Silla  Dynasty  all  Koreans  have  shared  the  same 
spoken  language.

Historical  Setting 


Political  and  Social  Institutions 

Despite  the  fact  that  Korea  would  undergo  numerous  reforms, 
palace  coups,  and  two  dynastic  changes  after  the  Silla  period,  many 
of  the  political  and  social  systems  and  practices  instituted  during 
the  Silla  Dynasty  persisted  until  the  nineteenth  century.  Their 
Chinese  inspiration,  of  course,  had  much  to  do  with  the  durability 
of  these  systems.  One  lasting  principle  was  that  of  centralized  rule. 
From  the  time  of  the  Koguryo,  Paekche,  and  Silla  states  of  the  Three 
Kingdoms  period,  royal  houses  always  governed  their  domains 
directly,  without  granting  autonomous  powers  to  local  adminis- 
trators. The  effectiveness  of  the  central  government  varied  from 
dynasty  to  dynasty  and  from  period  to  period,  but  the  principle 
of  centralization — involving  a  system  of  provinces,  districts,  towns, 
and  villages — was  never  modified. 

Another  feature  that  endured  for  centuries  was  the  existence  of 
a  stratified  social  system  characterized  by  a  clear  distinction  be- 
tween the  rulers  and  the  ruled.  Under  the  Silla  Dynasty,  society 
was  rigidly  organized  into  a  hereditary  caste  system.  The  Koryo 
Dynasty,  which  succeeded  Silla,  instituted  a  system  of  social  class- 
es according  to  which  the  rest  of  the  population  was  subordinate 
to  an  elite  composed  of  scholar-officials.  By  passing  the  higher  civil 
service  examination  and  becoming  a  government  official  a  com- 
moner could  become  a  member  of  the  elite,  but  since  examina- 
tions presupposed  both  the  time  and  wealth  for  education,  upward 
mobility  was  not  the  rule.  This  system  continued  during  the  Cho- 
son  Dynasty.  The  strength  of  the  aristocratic  tradition  may  have 
been  one  factor  contributing  to  the  relative  weakness  of  the  Korean 
monarchy,  in  which  the  king  usually  presided  over  a  council  of 
senior  officials  as  primus  inter  pares,  rather  than  governing  as  ab- 
solute ruler. 

During  the  Choson  Dynasty,  family  and  lineage  groups  came 
to  occupy  tremendous  importance.  Because  one's  social  and  polit- 
ical status  in  society  was  largely  determined  by  birth  and  lineage, 
it  was  only  natural  that  a  great  deal  of  emphasis  was  placed  on 
family.  Each  family  maintained  a  genealogical  table  with  meticulous 
care.  Only  male  offspring  could  prolong  the  family,  and  clan  lines 
and  theirs  were  the  only  names  registered  in  the  genealogical  ta- 
bles; therefore,  the  birth  of  a  son  was  regarded  as  an  occasion  of 
great  joy.  The  Confucian  stress  on  the  family  reinforced  the  im- 
portance Koreans  attached  to  the  family. 

The  Confucian  principle  of  Five  Relationships  (see  Glossary) 
governing  social  behavior  became  the  norm  of  Korean  society. 
Righteousness  toward  the  sovereign,  filial  piety,  deference  to  older 


19 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

and  superior  persons,  and  benevolence  to  the  younger  and  inferior 
became  inviolable  rules  of  conduct.  Transgressors  of  these  rules 
were  regarded  as  uncultured  beings  unfit  to  be  members  of  society. 
Whether  in  the  family  or  society  at  large,  people  in  positions  of 
authority  or  occupying  superior  status  commanded  respect. 

Still  another  enduring  feature  of  traditional  society  under  the 
Choson  Dynasty  was  the  dominance  of  the yangban  class.  The yangban 
not  only  held  power  but  also  controlled  the  national  wealth  in  the 
form  of  land.  The  court  permitted  the  yangban  to  collect  revenues 
on  the  land  as  remuneration  for  their  services.  Because  much  com- 
mercial activity  was  related  to  tributary  missions  to  China  or  to 
government  procurements,  the  wealth  of  the  merchants  often  was 
dependent  upon  the  discretion  of  the  yangban. 

Finally,  because  under  the  Choson  Dynasty  one  could  enter  into 
the  scholar-official  elite  by  passing  examinations  based  on  Confu- 
cian writings  and  penmanship,  the  entire  society  stressed  classical 
education.  The  arts  of  war  were  accorded  a  lesser  status,  even 
though  the  founders  of  both  the  Koryo  and  Choson  dynasties  were 
generals  and  despite  the  fact  that  the  country  had  suffered  from 
numerous  foreign  invasions. 

Korea  under  Japanese  Rule 

Korea  underwent  drastic  changes  under  Japanese  rule.  Even  be- 
fore the  country  was  formally  annexed  by  Japan  in  1910,  the 
Japanese  caused  the  last  ruling  monarch,  King  Kojong,  to  abdi- 
cate the  throne  in  1907  in  favor  of  his  feeble  son,  who  was  soon 
married  off  to  a  Japanese  woman  and  given  a  Japanese  peerage. 
Japan  then  governed  Korea  under  a  residency  general  and  subse- 
quently under  a  governor  general  directly  subordinate  to  Japanese 
prime  ministers.  All  of  the  governor  generals  were  high-ranking 
Japanese  military  officers. 

In  theory  the  Koreans,  as  subjects  of  the  Japanese  emperor,  en- 
joyed the  same  status  as  the  Japanese;  but  in  fact  the  Japanese 
government  treated  the  Koreans  as  a  conquered  people.  Until  1921 
they  were  not  allowed  to  publish  their  own  newspapers  or  to  or- 
ganize political  or  intellectual  groups. 

Nationalist  sentiments  gave  rise  to  a  Korean  student  demonstra- 
tion in  Japan,  and  on  March  1,  1919,  to  a  Proclamation  of  In- 
dependence by  a  small  group  of  leaders  in  Seoul.  With  the 
consolidation  of  what  became  known  as  the  March  First  Move- 
ment, street  demonstrations  led  by  Christian  and  Ch'ondogyo  (a 
movement  that  evolved  from  Tonghak)  groups  erupted  through- 
out the  country  to  protest  Japanese  rule.

In  the  wake  of  the  protest,  Japan  granted  considerable  latitude 
to  Korea.  As  historians  have  noted,  the  ensuing  intellectual  and 
social  ferment  of  the  1920s  marked  a  seminal  period  in  modern 
Korean  history.  Many  developments  of  the  period,  including  the 
organization  of  labor  unions  and  other  social  and  economic  move- 
ments, had  continuing  influence  into  the  postliberation  period.  In 
the  1930s,  however,  the  ascendancy  of  the  military  in  Japanese  poli- 
tics reversed  the  change.  Particularly  after  1937,  when  Japan 
launched  the  Second  Sino-Japanese  War  (1937-45)  against  China, 
the  colonial  government  decided  on  a  policy  of  mobilizing  the  entire 
country  for  the  cause  of  the  war.  Not  only  was  the  economy  reor- 
ganized onto  a  war  footing,  but  the  Koreans  were  to  be  totally  assim- 
ilated as  Japanese.  The  government  also  began  to  enlist  Korean 
youths  in  the  Japanese  army  as  volunteers  in  1938  and  as  conscripts 
in  1943.  Worship  at  Shinto  shrines  became  mandatory,  and  every 
attempt  at  preserving  Korean  identity  was  discouraged. 

The  Korean  economy  also  underwent  significant  change.  Japan's 
initial  colonial  policy  was  to  increase  agricultural  production  in 
Korea  to  meet  Japan's  growing  need  for  rice.  Japan  had  also  be- 
gun to  build  large-scale  industries  in  Korea  in  the  1930s  as  part 
of  the  empire-wide  program  of  economic  self-sufficiency  and  war 
preparation.  Between  1939  and  1941,  the  manufacturing  sector 


21 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

represented  29  percent  of  Korea's  total  economic  production.  The 
primary  industries — agriculture,  fishing,  and  forestry — occupied 
only  49.6  percent  of  total  economic  production  during  that  period, 
in  contrast  to  having  provided  84.6  percent  of  total  production  be- 
tween 1910  and  1912. 

The  economic  development  taking  place  under  Japanese  rule, 
however,  brought  little  benefit  to  the  Koreans.  Virtually  all  indus- 
tries were  owned  either  by  Japan-based  corporations  or  by  Japanese 
corporations  in  Korea  (see  The  Japanese  Role  in  Korea's  Economic 
Development,  ch.  3).  As  of  1942,  Korean  capital  constituted  only 
1 .5  percent  of  the  total  capital  invested  in  Korean  industries.  Korean 
entrepreneurs  were  charged  interest  rates  25  percent  higher  than 
their  Japanese  counterparts,  so  it  was  difficult  for  Korean  enter- 
prises to  emerge.  More  and  more  farmland  was  taken  over  by  the 
Japanese,  and  an  increasing  proportion  of  Korean  farmers  either 
became  sharecroppers  or  migrated  to  Japan  or  Manchuria.  As 
greater  quantities  of  Korean  rice  were  exported  to  Japan,  per  capita 
consumption  of  rice  among  the  Koreans  declined;  between  1932 
and  1936,  per  capita  consumption  of  rice  declined  to  half  the  level 
consumed  between  1912  and  1916.  Although  the  government  im- 
ported coarse  grains  from  Manchuria  to  augment  the  Korean  food 
supply,  per  capita  consumption  of  food  grains  in  1944  was  35  per- 
cent below  that  of  1912  to  1916. 

Under  Japanese  rule,  intellectual  influences  different  from  tradi- 
tional Buddhist,  Confucianist,  and  shamanistic  beliefs  flooded  the 
country.  Western-style  painting  was  introduced,  and  literary  trends, 
even  among  writers  who  emphasized  themes  of  social  protest  and 
national  independence,  tended  to  follow  Japanese  and  European 
models,  particularly  those  developed  during  the  late  nineteenth  and 
early  twentieth  centuries.  The  works  of  Russian,  German,  French, 
British,  American,  and  Japanese  authors  were  read  by  the  more 
educated  Koreans,  and  Korean  writers  increasingly  adopted 
Western  ideas  and  literary  forms.  Social  and  political  themes  were 
prominent.  Tears  of  Blood,  the  first  of  the  "new  novels,"  published 
by  Yi  In-jik  in  serial  form  in  a  magazine  in  1906,  stressed  the  need 
for  social  reform  and  cultural  enlightenment,  following  Western 
and  Japanese  models.  Yi  Kwang-su's  The  Heartless,  published  in 
1917,  stressed  the  need  for  mass  education,  Western  science,  and 
the  repudiation  of  the  old  family  and  social  system.  Ch'ae  Man- 
sik's  Ready  Made  Life,  published  in  1934,  protested  the  injustices 
of  colonial  society. 

In  the  1920s  and  1930s,  socialist  ideas  began  to  influence  the 
development  of  literature.  In  1925  left-wing  artists,  rejecting  the 
romanticism  of  many  contemporary  writers,  established  the  Korean

Proletarian  Artists'  Federation,  which  continued  until  it  was  sup- 
pressed by  Japanese  authorities  in  1935.  One  of  the  best  represen- 
tatives of  this  group  was  Yi  Ki-yong,  whose  1936  novel  Home  tells 
of  the  misery  of  villagers  under  Japanese  rule  and  the  efforts  of 
the  protagonist,  a  student,  to  organize  them.  Poets  during  the  coloni- 
al period  included  Yi  Sang-hwa,  Kim  So-wol,  and  Han  Yong-un. 
But  the  beginning  of  the  Second  Sino-Japanese  War  marked  a 
period  of  unprecedented  repression  in  the  cultural  sphere  by 
Japanese  authorities,  which  continued  until  Korea's  liberation  in 
1945. 

From  the  late  1930s  until  1945,  the  colonial  government  pur- 
sued a  policy  of  assimilation  whose  primary  goal  was  to  force  the 
Koreans  to  speak  Japanese  and  to  consider  themselves  Japanese 
subjects.  In  1937  the  Japanese  governor  general  ordered  that  all 
instruction  in  Korean  schools  be  in  Japanese  and  that  students  not 
be  allowed  to  speak  Korean  either  inside  or  outside  of  school.  In 
1939  another  decree  "encouraged"  Koreans  to  adopt  Japanese 
names,  and  by  the  following  year  it  was  reported  that  84  percent 
of  all  Korean  families  had  done  so.  During  the  war  years,  Korean- 
language  newspapers  and  magazines  were  shut  down.  Belief  in 
the  divinity  of  the  Japanese  emperor  was  encouraged,  and  Shinto 
shrines  were  built  throughout  the  country.  Had  Japanese  rule  not 


23

ended  in  1945,  the  fate  of  indigenous  Korean  language,  culture, 
and  religious  practices  would  have  been  extremely  uncertain  (see 
Korea  and  Japan,  ch.  2). 

Japanese  rule  was  harsh,  particularly  after  the  Japanese  militarists 
began  their  expansionist  drive  in  the  1930s.  Internal  Korean 
resistance,  however,  virtually  ceased  in  the  1930s  as  the  police  and 
the  military  gendarmes  imposed  strict  surveillance  over  all  people 
suspected  of  subversive  inclinations  and  meted  out  severe  punish- 
ment against  recalcitrants.  Most  Koreans  opted  to  pay  lip  service 
to  the  colonial  government.  Others  actively  collaborated  with  the 
Japanese.  The  treatment  of  collaborators  became  a  sensitive  and 
sometimes  violent  issue  during  the  years  immediately  following 
liberation. 

World  War  II  and  Korea 

On  August  8,  1945,  during  the  final  days  of  World  War  II,  the 
Soviet  Union  declared  war  against  Japan  and  launched  an  inva- 
sion of  Manchuria  and  Korea.  By  then,  Japan  had  been  depleted 
by  the  drawn-out  war  against  the  United  States  and  its  Allies,  and 
Japanese  forces  were  in  no  position  to  stave  off  the  Soviets.  The 
dropping  of  atomic  bombs  on  Hiroshima  and  Nagasaki  on  August 
6  and  August  9,  respectively,  had  led  the  Japanese  government 
to  search  for  ways  to  end  the  war.  On  August  15,  1945,  Japan  sur- 
rendered unconditionally. 

The  Japanese  surrender  and  the  Soviet  landing  on  the  Korean 
Peninsula  totally  altered  the  history  of  contemporary  Korea.  At 
the  Cairo  Conference  of  December  1943,  the  Allies  had  decided 
to  strip  Japan  of  all  the  territories  it  had  acquired  since  1894,  the 
beginning  of  Japan's  expansionist  drive  abroad.  The  United  States, 
China,  and  Britain  had  agreed  at  Cairo  that  Korea  would  be  allowed 
to  become  free  and  independent  in  due  course  after  the  Allied  vic- 
tory. The  Soviet  Union  agreed  to  the  same  principle  in  its  decla- 
ration of  war  against  Japan. 

Although  the  United  States  president,  Franklin  D.  Roosevelt, 
and  Marshal  Josef  V.  Stalin  of  the  Soviet  Union  had  agreed  to 
establish  an  international  trusteeship  for  Korea  at  the  Yalta  Con- 
ference of  February  1945,  no  decision  had  been  made  on  the  exact 
formula  for  governing  the  nation  in  the  aftermath  of  Allied  victory. 
The  landing  of  Soviet  forces,  however,  compelled  the  United  States 
government  to  improvise  a  formula  for  Korea.  Unless  an  agree- 
ment were  reached,  the  Soviets  could  very  well  occupy  the  entire 
peninsula  and  place  Korea  under  their  control.  Thus,  on  August 
15,  1945,  President  Harry  S  Truman  proposed  to  Stalin  the  divi- 
sion of  Korea  at  the  thirty-eighth  parallel.  The  next  day  Stalin 


24 


Historical  Setting 


agreed.  Evidently  Stalin  did  not  wish  to  confront  the  United  States 
by  occupying  the  entire  peninsula.  He  may  also  have  hoped  that 
the  United  States,  in  return,  would  permit  the  Soviet  Union  to 
occupy  the  northern  half  of  the  northernmost  major  Japanese  is- 
land, Hokkaido  (see  fig.  3). 

The  Allied  foreign  ministers  subsequently  met  in  Moscow  on 
December  7,  1945,  and  decided  to  establish  a  trusteeship  for  a  five- 
year  period,  during  which  a  Korean  provisional  government  would 
prepare  for  full  independence;  they  also  agreed  to  form  a  joint 
United  States-Soviet  commission  to  assist  in  organizing  a  single 
4 'provisional  Korean  democratic  government."  The  trusteeship 
proposal  was  immediately  opposed  by  nearly  all  Koreans,  espe- 
cially the  Korean  right  under  Syngman  Rhee,  who  used  the  issue 
to  consolidate  his  domestic  political  base.  The  Korean  communists 
objected  at  first,  but  quickly  changed  their  position  under  Soviet 
direction. 

The  joint  commission  met  intermittently  in  Seoul  from  March 
1946  until  it  adjourned  indefinitely  in  October  1947.  The  Soviet 
insistence  that  only  those  "democratic"  parties  and  social  organi- 
zations upholding  the  trusteeship  plan  be  allowed  to  participate  in 
the  formation  of  an  all- Korean  government  was  unacceptable  to 
the  United  States.  The  United  States  argued  that  the  Soviet  for- 
mula, if  accepted,  would  put  the  communists  in  controlling  posi- 
tions throughout  Korea. 

South  Korea  under  United  States  Occupation, 
1945-48 

The  three-year  occupation  by  the  United  States  of  the  area  ap- 
proximating present-day  South  Korea,  following  the  liberation  of 
Korea  from  Japan,  was  characterized  by  uncertainty  and  confu- 
sion. This  difficult  situation  stemmed  largely  from  the  absence  of 
a  clearly  formulated  United  States  policy  for  Korea,  the  intensifi- 
cation of  the  confrontation  between  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet 
Union,  and  the  polarization  of  Korean  politics  between  left  and 
right.  Although  the  United  States  had  maintained  diplomatic  ties 
with  the  Choson  Dynasty  between  1882  and  1905,  Korea  in  1945 
still  was  a  remote  country  known  only  to  a  small  number  of  mis- 
sionaries and  adventurous  businessmen,  holding  little  importance 
in  the  official  scheme  of  things.  And  although  the  United  States 
had  proposed  the  thirty-eighth  parallel  as  a  dividing  line  between 
the  two  occupation  armies,  United  States  policymakers  still  were 
unsure  of  the  strategic  value  of  South  Korea.  United  States  policy

toward  Korea  became  more  uncertain  after  the  deadlock  of  the 
United  States-Soviet  joint  commission.  While  United  States  officials 
were  pessimistic  about  resolving  their  differences  with  the  Soviet 
Union,  they  remained  committed  to  the  December  1945  decision 


26 


Historical  Setting 


of  the  Allied  foreign  ministers  (made  during  their  Moscow  meet- 
ing) that  a  trusteeship  under  four  powers,  including  China,  should 
be  established  with  a  view  toward  Korea's  eventual  independence. 
Thus,  United  States  officials  were  slow  to  draw  up  long-range 
alternative  plans  for  South  Korea. 

Moreover,  as  the  Soviet  Union  consolidated  its  power  in  North 
Korea  and  the  Nationalist  Party  (Guomindang  or  Kuomintang — 
KMT)  government  of  Chiang  Kai-shek  began  to  falter  in  China, 
United  States  strategists  began  to  question  the  long-run  defensibility 
of  South  Korea.  By  1947  it  appeared  that  South  Korea  would  become 
the  only  area  of  mainland  Northeast  Asia  not  under  communist  con- 
trol. According  to  one  highly  placed  official,  this  was  an  "exposed, 
unsound  military  position,  one  that  [was]  doing  no  good." 

Lieutenant  General  John  R.  Hodge,  commander  of  the  United 
States  occupation  forces  in  Korea,  was  obliged  to  work  under  a 
severe  handicap — a  mission  of  maintaining  peace  and  order  until 
the  international  conflict  over  Korea  was  resolved.  Possessing  very 
limited  resources,  Hodge  was  expected  to  pursue  the  "ultimate 
objective"  of  fostering  "conditions  which  would  bring  about  the 
establishment  of  a  free  and  independent  nation." 

General  Hodge  had  to  contend  with  hostile  Korean  political 
groups.  Before  United  States  forces  had  landed  in  Korea  in  Sep- 
tember 1945,  the  Koreans  had  established  self-governing  bodies, 
or  people's  committees.  The  leaders  of  these  committees  had  organ- 
ized the  Central  People's  Committee,  which  proclaimed  the  estab- 
lishment of  the  "Korean  People's  Republic"  on  September  6,  1945. 
Exiles  abroad,  mainly  in  China,  had  organized  the  "Korean  Provi- 
sional Government"  in  Shanghai  as  early  as  1919  and  had  sus- 
tained a  skeletal  organization  in  other  parts  of  China  until  1945. 

The  United  States  recognized  neither  the  republic  nor  the  provi- 
sional government.  The  provisional  government  was  headed  by 
Syngman  Rhee,  its  first  president,  and  Kim  Ku  and  Kim  Kyu- 
sik,  premier  and  vice  premier,  respectively.  The  United  States 
would  not  recognize  any  group  as  a  government  until  an  agree- 
ment was  reached  among  the  Western  Allies.  The  exiles  were  mol- 
lified by  the  favorable  treatment  they  received  when  they  returned 
to  South  Korea,  but  were  incensed  by  the  order  to  disband  issued 
by  the  United  States  Army  Military  Government  in  Korea.  The 
military  government  that  administered  the  American-occupied  zone 
proceeded  to  disband  the  local  people's  committees  and  impose 
direct  rule,  assigning  military  personnel  who  lacked  language  skills 
and  knowledge  of  Korea  as  governors  at  various  levels. 

The  Korean  Communist  Party,  resuscitated  in  October  1945, 
had  been  a  major  force  behind  the  Central  People's  Committee 


27 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

and  the  "Korean  People's  Republic"  and  quickly  built  a  substan- 
tial following  among  the  workers,  farmers,  and  students.  The  party 
eventually  changed  its  stance  on  trusteeship  and  came  out  in  sup- 
port of  it  on  January  3,  1946.  Because  the  party  was  under  the 
control  of  the  Soviet  command  in  P'yongyang,  it  came  into  direct 
confrontation  with  the  United  States  Army  military  government. 

The  situation  was  exacerbated  in  December  1945  when  the  de- 
cision to  establish  a  trusteeship  was  announced.  To  the  Koreans, 
who  had  anticipated  immediate  independence,  the  decision  to 
implement  a  five-year  trusteeship  was  humiliating,  and  the  initially 
warm  welcome  to  United  States  troops  as  liberators  cooled.  By  early 
1946,  the  United  States  Army  military  government  had  come  to 
rely  heavily  on  the  advice  and  counsel  of  ideologically  conserva- 
tive elements,  including  landlords  and  other  propertied  persons. 

The  United  States  initially  supported  the  returned  exiles  and  the 
conservative  elements,  but  between  May  1946  and  April  1947,  the 
military  government  tried  to  mobilize  support  behind  a  coalition 
between  the  moderate  left  represented  by  Yo  Un-hyong  (or  Lyuh 
Woon  Hyung),  who  had  been  the  figurehead  of  the  Central  People's 
Committee,  and  the  moderate  right,  represented  by  Kim  Kyu-sik, 
vice  premier  of  the  exiled  government.  This  attempt  only  intensi- 
fied splits  within  the  left-wing  and  right-wing  camps  without  produc- 
ing any  positive  results.  The  moderates'  argument  that  the  Koreans 
should  oppose  the  trusteeship  was  unacceptable  to  the  other  par- 
ties. Communist  leaders,  on  the  other  hand,  were  driven  under- 
ground in  May  1946  after  the  discovery  of  a  currency-counterfeiting 
operation  run  by  the  party.  The  left-wing  and  right-wing  groups, 
in  the  meantime,  frequently  engaged  in  violent  clashes  not  only 
on  ideological  grounds,  but  also  because  of  their  opposing  views 
about  the  trusteeship  decision. 

In  December  1946,  the  military  government  established  the  South 
Korean  Interim  Legislative  Assembly  to  formulate  draft  laws  to 
be  used  as  "the  basis  for  political,  economic,  and  social  reforms." 
South  Korea's  problems,  however,  required  solutions  at  a  much 
higher  level.  The  left-wing  political  groups,  consolidated  under  the 
rubric  of  the  South  Korean  Workers'  Party,  ignored  the  assem- 
bly. The  conservative  Korean  Democratic  Party,  supported  by  land- 
lords and  small-business  owners,  opposed  the  assembly  because  their 
principal  leaders  were  excluded  from  it.  Although  many  of  the  as- 
sembly's forty-five  elected  members  were  conservatives,  most  of 
the  forty-five  appointed  members  were  moderates  nominated  by 
Kim  Kyu-sik,  who  had  emerged  as  Hodge's  choice  for  political 
leadership.  Unfortunately,  Kim  lacked  dynamism  and  broad  sup- 
port among  the  masses.

Historical  Setting 


Economy  and  Society 

These  circumstances  had  thrown  South  Korea's  economy  into 
complete  chaos.  Even  if  the  occupation  forces  had  arrived  with  a 
carefully  laid  economic  plan,  the  situation  would  have  been  difficult 
because  the  Japanese  had  developed  Korea's  economy  as  an  in- 
tegral part  of  their  empire,  linking  Korea  to  Japan  and  Manchuria. 

The  division  of  Korea  into  two  zones  at  an  arbitrary  line  fur- 
ther aggravated  the  situation.  There  were  many  inherent  problems 
in  building  a  self-sufficient  economy  in  the  southern  half  of  the 
peninsula.  Most  of  the  heavy  industrial  facilities  were  located  in 
northern  Korea — the  Soviet  zone — including  the  chemical  plants 
that  produced  necessary  agricultural  fertilizers.  Light  industries  in 
southern  Korea  had  been  dependent  on  electricity  from  the  hydrau- 
lic generators  located  on  the  Yalu  River  on  the  Korean- Manchurian 
border;  electric  generating  facilities  in  the  south  supplied  only  9 
percent  of  the  total  need.  Railroads  and  industries  in  the  south  also 
had  been  dependent  upon  bituminous  coal  imported  from  Man- 
churia, Japan,  and  the  north  (although  the  south  had  been  exporting 
some  excess  anthracite  to  the  north). 

The  problems  were  compounded  by  the  fact  that  most  of  Korea's 
mines  and  industries  had  been  owned  and  operated  by  Japan.  As 
the  United  States  Army  military  government  let  the  700,000 
Japanese  depart  from  South  Korea  in  the  months  following  the  start 
of  the  American  occupation,  almost  all  of  the  mines  and  factories — 
now  enemy  properties  vested  in  the  military  government — were 
without  managers,  technicians,  and  capital  resources.  This  situa- 
tion led  to  severe  problems  of  unemployment  and  material 
shortages. 

The  months  after  the  arrival  of  occupation  forces  also  witnessed 
a  vast  inflow  of  population.  South  Korea's  population,  estimated 
at  just  over  16  million  in  1945,  grew  by  21  percent  during  the  next 
year.  By  1950  more  than  1  million  workers  had  returned  from 
Japan,  120,000  from  China  and  Manchuria,  and  1 .8  million  from 
the  north.  The  annual  rate  of  increase  of  births  over  deaths  con- 
tinued at  about  3.1  percent.  Since  rural  areas  were  inhospitable 
to  newcomers,  most  of  the  refugees  settled  in  urban  areas;  Seoul 
received  upwards  of  one-third  of  the  total.  The  situation  was  fur- 
ther aggravated  by  scarcities  of  food  and  other  commodities  and 
by  runaway  inflation,  caused  in  part  by  the  fact  that  the  departing 
Japanese  had  flooded  Korea  with  newly  printed  yen. 

The  social  unrest  created  by  these  developments  can  be  easily 
surmised.  By  1947  only  about  half  the  labor  force  of  10  million 
was  gainfully  employed.  Labor  strikes  and  work  stoppages  were 


29 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


recurrent  phenomena,  and  demonstrations  against  the  United  States 
Army  military  government's  policies  drew  large  crowds.  Temporary 
stoppages  of  electricity — supplied  from  the  northern  areas — in  the 
early  part  of  1946  and  late  1947  plunged  the  southern  region  into 
darkness  on  each  occasion,  deepening  the  despair  of  the  populace. 
The  disillusioned  and  disconcerted  people  paid  keen  atten- 
tion to  political  leaders  of  various  persuasions  who  offered  new  ways 
of  solving  the  Korean  problem. 

Establishment  of  the  Republic  of  Korea 

In  this  atmosphere,  the  United  States  scuttled  an  earlier  plan 
to  provide  US$500  million  over  five  years  for  South  Korean  devel- 
opment. It  then  submitted  the  Korean  problem  to  the  United 
Nations  (UN)  in  September  1947.  In  November  the  UN  General 
Assembly  recognized  Korea's  claim  to  independence  and  made 
preparations  for  the  establishment  of  a  government  and  the  with- 
drawal of  occupation  forces.  The  United  Nations  Temporary  Com- 
mission on  Korea  arrived  to  supervise  the  election  of  a  national 
assembly,  which  was  held  in  May  1948.  The  Soviet  Union, 
however,  objected  to  the  UN  resolution  and  refused  to  admit  the 
commission  to  the  Soviet-controlled  zone  in  the  north.  It  was  becom- 
ing increasingly  clear  that  two  separate  regimes  would  be  estab- 
lished on  the  peninsula. 

The  prospect  of  perpetuating  the  division  of  Korea  catapulted 
some  of  the  southern  political  leaders  to  action,  significantly  alter- 
ing the  political  configuration  there.  The  choice  they  faced  was  be- 
tween immediate  independence  at  the  price  of  indefinite  division, 
or  postponement  of  independence  until  the  deadlock  between  the 
United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union  was  resolved.  Rhee  had  cam- 
paigned actively  within  Korea  and  the  United  States  for  the  first 
alternative  since  June  1946.  Other  major  figures  in  the  right-wing 
camp,  including  Kim  Ku  and  Kim  Kyu-sik,  decided  to  oppose  the 
"separate  elections"  in  the  south,  hoping  to  resolve  the  interna- 
tional impasse  by  holding  talks  with  their  northern  counterparts. 
The  group  led  by  the  two  Kims  made  their  way  to  P'yongyang, 
the  future  capital  of  North  Korea,  in  April  1948,  boycotted  the 
May  1948  elections,  and  were  discredited  when  P'yongyang  cut 
off  electricity,  leaving  Rhee  a  clear  field  although  he  lacked  grass 
roots  support  apart  from  the  Korean  Democratic  Party.  By  this 
time,  the  communists  in  the  south  had  lost  much  of  their  political 
following,  particularly  after  a  serious  riot  in  October  1946;  most 
of  their  leaders  congregated  in  the  north.  The  moderate  left-wing 
camp  was  in  disarray  after  their  leader,  Yo  Un-hyong,  was  assas- 
sinated in  July  1947.  Kim  Kyu-sik  had  been  the  clear  choice  of  the

United  States  Army  military  government,  but  he  could  not  be  dis- 
suaded from  his  fruitless  trip  to  P'yongyang. 

The  National  Assembly  elected  in  May  1948  adopted  a  consti- 
tution setting  forth  a  presidential  form  of  government  and  specifying 
a  four-year  term  for  the  presidency.  Syngman  Rhee,  whose  sup- 
porters had  won  the  elections,  became  head  of  the  new  assembly. 
On  this  basis,  when  on  August  15,  1948,  the  Republic  of  Korea 
(South  Korea)  was  proclaimed,  Rhee  assumed  the  presidency.  Four 
days  after  the  proclamation,  communist  authorities  completed  the 
severing  of  north-south  ties  by  shutting  off  power  transmission  to 
the  south.  Within  less  than  a  month,  a  communist  regime,  the  Demo- 
cratic People's  Republic  of  Korea  (North  Korea),  was  proclaimed 
under  Premier  Kim  II  Sung,  who  claimed  authority  over  the  entire 
country  by  virtue  of  elections  conducted  in  the  north  and  the  under- 
ground elections  allegedly  held  in  the  south.  Rhee  scarcely  had  time 
to  put  his  political  house  in  order  before  North  Korea  launched 
its  attack  on  South  Korea  in  June  1950. 

The  South  Korean  army  had  come  into  being  in  September  1948 
(see  The  South  Korean  Army  after  World  War  II,  ch.  5).  A  commu- 
nist-led revolt  of  army  regiments  in  the  southern  part  of  the  penin- 
sula in  October  of  the  same  year,  known  as  the  Yosu-Sunch'on 
rebellion,  had  consumed  much  of  the  army's  attention  and 
resources,  however,  and  a  massive  purge  in  the  aftermath  of  that 
revolt  weakened  the  entire  military  establishment.  Given  South 
Korea's  precarious  future  and  the  communist  victory  in  China, 
the  United  States  was  not  eager  to  provide  support.  By  June  29, 
1949,  United  States  occupation  forces  had  been  withdrawn,  save 
for  a  handful  of  military  advisers,  and  Korea  had  been  placed  out- 
side of  the  United  States  defense  perimeter. 

The  Korean  War,  1950-53 

In  the  meantime,  the  communists  had  built  a  formidable  politi- 
cal and  military  structure  in  North  Korea  under  the  aegis  of  the 
Soviet  command.  They  had  created  a  regional  Five-Province  Ad- 
ministrative Bureau  in  October  1945,  which  was  reorganized  into 
the  North  Korean  Provisional  People's  Committee  in  February  1946 
and  shed  the  "Provisional"  component  of  its  name  twelve  months 
later.  The  communists  also  expanded  and  consolidated  their  party's 
strength  by  merging  all  of  the  left-wing  groups  into  the  North 
Korean  Workers'  Party  in  August  1946.  Beginning  in  1946,  the 
armed  forces  also  were  organized  and  reinforced.  Between  1946 
and  1949,  large  numbers  of  North  Korean  youths — at  least 
10,000 — were  taken  to  the  Soviet  Union  for  military  training.  A 
draft  was  instituted,  and  in  1949  two  divisions — 40,000  troops — 


31 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

of  the  former  Korean  Volunteer  Army  in  China,  who  had  trained 
under  the  Chinese  communists  and  had  participated  in  the  Chinese 
civil  war  (1945-49),  returned  to  North  Korea. 

By  June  1950,  North  Korean  forces  numbered  between  150,000 
and  200,000  troops,  organized  into  ten  infantry  divisions,  one  tank 
division,  and  one  air  force  division.  Soviet  equipment,  including 
automatic  weapons  of  various  types,  T-34  tanks,  and  Yak  fighter 
planes,  had  also  been  pouring  into  North  Korea  in  early  1950. 
These  forces  were  to  fight  the  ill-equipped  South  Korean  army  of 
less  than  100,000  men — an  army  lacking  in  tanks,  heavy  artillery, 
and  combat  airplanes — plus  a  coast  guard  of  4,000  men  and  a  police 
force  of  45,000  men. 

The  events  following  the  June  1950  invasion  proved  the  superi- 
ority of  North  Korean  military  forces  and  the  soundness  of  their  over- 
all invasion  strategy.  South  Korea's  army  was  simply  overwhelmed; 
Seoul  fell  within  three  days.  By  early  August,  South  Korean  forces 
were  confined  in  the  southeastern  corner  of  the  peninsula  to  a  terri- 
tory 140  kilometers  long  and  90  kilometers  wide.  The  rest  of  the  ter- 
ritory was  completely  in  the  hands  of  the  North  Korean  army. 

The  only  unforeseen  event  complicating  North  Korea's  strategy 
was  the  swift  decision  by  the  United  States  to  commit  forces  in  sup- 
port of  South  Korea.  On  June  26,  1950,  Truman  ordered  the  use 
of  United  States  planes  and  naval  vessels  against  North  Korean 
forces,  and  on  June  30  United  States  ground  troops  were  dispatched. 
The  United  States,  fearing  that  inaction  in  Korea  would  be  inter- 
preted as  appeasement  of  communist  aggression  elsewhere  in  the 
world,  was  determined  that  South  Korea  should  not  be  over- 
whelmed and  asked  the  UN  Security  Council  to  intervene.  When 
Douglas  MacArthur,  the  commanding  general  of  the  United 
Nations  forces  in  Korea,  launched  his  amphibious  attack  and  landed 
at  Inch'on  on  September  15,  the  course  of  the  war  changed 
abruptly.  Much  of  North  Korea  was  taken  by  United  States  and 
South  Korean  forces  before  Chinese  "volunteers"  intervened  in 
October,  enabling  North  Korea  to  eventually  restore  its  authority 
over  its  domain.  The  war  lasted  until  July  27,  1953,  when  a  cease- 
fire agreement  was  signed  at  P'anmunjom.  By  then,  the  war  had 
involved  China  and  the  Soviet  Union,  which  had  dispatched  air 
force  divisions  to  Manchuria  in  support  of  North  Korea  and  had 
furnished  the  Chinese  and  North  Koreans  with  arms,  tanks,  mili- 
tary supplies,  fuel,  foodstuffs,  and  medicine.  Fifteen  member- 
nations  of  the  United  Nations  had  contributed  armed  forces  and 
medical  units  to  South  Korea. 

The  war  left  indelible  marks  on  the  Korean  Peninsula  and  the 
world  surrounding  it.  The  entire  peninsula  was  reduced  to  rubble; 


32 


Historical  Setting 


casualties  on  both  sides  were  enormous.  The  chances  for  peaceful 
unification  had  been  remote  even  before  1950,  but  the  war  dashed 
all  such  hopes.  Sizable  numbers  of  South  Koreans  who  either  had 
been  sympathetic  or  indifferent  to  communism  before  the  war  be- 
came avowed  anticommunists  afterwards.  The  war  also  intensi- 
fied hostilities  between  the  communist  and  noncommunist  camps 
in  the  accelerating  East- West  arms  race.  Moreover,  a  large  num- 
ber of  Chinese  volunteer  troops  remained  in  North  Korea  until 
October  1958,  and  China  began  to  play  an  increasingly  important 
role  in  Korean  affairs.  Because  tension  on  the  Korean  Peninsula 
remained  high,  the  United  States  continued  to  station  troops  in 
South  Korea  over  the  strenuous  objections  of  North  Korean  leaders. 
The  war  also  spurred  Japan's  industrial  recovery  and  the  United 
States'  decision  to  rearm  Japan. 

The  Syngman  Rhee  Era,  1948-60 
The  Political  Environment 

Even  though  Syngman  Rhee  had  been  handily  elected  president 
by  the  National  Assembly  in  1948 — with  180  of  the  196  votes  cast 
in  his  favor — he  quickly  ran  into  difficulties.  South  Korean  poli- 
tics during  Rhee's  regime  (1948-60)  essentially  revolved  around 
Rhee's  struggle  to  remain  in  power  and  the  opposition's  efforts 
to  unseat  him.  Constitutional  provisions  concerning  the  presidency 
became  the  focal  point. 

Because  Rhee's  four-year  term  of  office  was  to  end  in  August 
1952  under  the  1948  constitution,  and  because  he  had  no  prospect 
of  being  reelected  by  the  National  Assembly,  he  supported  a  con- 
stitutional amendment,  introduced  in  November  1951,  to  elect  the 
president  by  popular  vote.  The  proposal  was  resoundingly  defeated 
by  a  vote  of  143  to  19,  prompting  Rhee  to  marshal  his  supporters 
into  the  Liberal  Party.  Four  months  later,  in  April  1952,  the  opposi- 
tion introduced  another  motion  calling  for  a  parliamentary  form 
of  government.  Rhee  declared  martial  law  in  May,  rounded  up 
the  assembly  members  by  force,  and  called  for  another  vote.  His 
constitutional  amendment  to  elect  the  president  by  popular  vote 
was  railroaded  through,  passing  with  163  votes  of  the  166  assem- 
bly members  present.  In  the  subsequent  popular  election  in  August, 
Rhee  was  reelected  by  72  percent  of  the  voters. 

The  constitution,  however,  limited  the  president  to  only  two 
terms.  Hence,  when  the  end  of  Rhee's  second  term  of  office  ap- 
proached, the  constitution  again  was  amended  (in  November  1954) 
by  the  use  of  fraudulent  tactics  that  allowed  Rhee  to  succeed  him- 
self indefinitely.

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

In  the  meantime,  South  Korea's  citizens,  particularly  the  urban 
masses,  had  become  more  politically  conscious.  The  press  frequently 
exposed  government  ineptitude  and  corruption  and  attacked  Rhee's 
authoritarian  rule.  The  Democratic  Party  capitalized  on  these  par- 
ticulars; in  the  May  1956  presidential  election,  Rhee  won  only  55 
percent  of  the  votes,  even  though  his  principal  opponent,  Sin  Ik-hiii, 
had  died  of  a  heart  attack  ten  days  before  the  election.  Rhee's  run- 
ning mate,  Yi  Ki-bung,  fared  much  worse,  losing  to  the  Democratic 
Party  candidate,  Chang  Myon  (John  M.  Chang).  Since  Rhee  was 
already  eighty-one  years  old  in  1956,  Chang's  victory  caused  a 
major  tremor  among  Rhee's  supporters. 

Thereafter,  the  issue  of  Rhee's  age  and  the  goal  of  electing  Yi 
Ki-bung  became  an  obsession.  The  administration  became  increas- 
ingly repressive  as  Liberal  Party  leaders  came  to  dominate  the 
political  arena,  including  government  operations,  around  1958.  Yi, 
formerly  Rhee's  personal  secretary,  and  his  wife  (Mrs.  Rhee's  con- 
fidant and  a  power-behind-the-scenes)  had  convinced  the  child- 
less Rhee  to  adopt  their  son  as  his  legal  heir.  For  fear  that  Rhee's 
health  might  be  impaired,  he  was  carefully  shielded  from  all  infor- 
mation that  might  upset  him.  Thus,  the  aged  and  secluded  pres- 
ident became  a  captive  of  the  system  he  had  built,  rather  than  its 
master. 

In  March  1960,  the  Liberal  Party  managed  to  reelect  Rhee  and 
to  elect  Yi  Ki-bung  vice  president  by  the  blatant  use  of  force.  Rhee 
was  reelected  by  default  because  his  principal  opponent  had  died 
while  receiving  medical  treatment  in  the  United  States  just  before 
the  election.  As  for  Yi,  he  was  largely  confined  to  his  sickbed — a 
cause  of  public  anger — but  "won"  8.3  million  votes  as  against  1.8 
million  votes  for  Chang  Myon.  The  fraudulent  election  touched 
off  civil  disorders,  known  and  celebrated  as  the  April  19  Student 
Revolution,  during  which  142  students  were  killed  by  the  police. 
As  a  result,  Rhee  resigned  on  April  26,  1960.  The  next  day  all 
four  members  of  the  Yi  family  died  in  a  suicide  pact.  This  account 
has  been  challenged  by  some  who  believed  Yi's  family  was  killed 
by  his  bodyguards  in  hopes  of  enabling  Rhee  to  stay  on. 

Rhee,  a  self-righteous  man  convinced  of  his  indispensability  to 
Korea,  loathed  his  critics  and  opponents  and  equated  criticism  with 
treason.  Although  his  record  as  a  national  hero  and  his  skill  in  han- 
dling United  States-Korean  relations  won  him  admiration  during 
the  immediate  years  after  the  Korean  War,  Rhee  became  a  cap- 
tive of  the  people  surrounding  him.  In  the  late  1950s,  his  policies 
were  largely  without  results  as  rapid  changes  in  the  economy  and 
society  deeply  affected  South  Korea's  system.

Historical  Setting 


Society  under  Rhee 

The  transformation  of  South  Korean  society  during  the  Rhee 
era  was  of  revolutionary  proportions  because  of  the  convergence 
of  a  number  of  forces.  A  major  impetus  for  social  change  was  the 
greatly  enhanced  opportunity  for  education.  Although  Japan  had 
introduced  a  modern  education  system  to  Korea,  opportunities  for 
Koreans  were  purposely  limited,  particularly  at  the  secondary  and 
university  levels.  Educational  opportunities  were  greatly  expand- 
ed immediately  after  the  Japanese  defeat,  and  the  trend  continued 
through  the  Korean  War  and  afterwards.  Higher  education  provided 
more  opportunities  for  upward  mobility  to  a  large  number  of  young 
people.  This  opening  also  meant  greater  political  awakening  among 
the  young,  particularly  in  view  of  the  strong  emphasis  placed  on 
democratic  values  and  ideas  by  teachers  and  intellectuals.  For  the 
first  time,  Korean  youths  were  provided  open  access  to  democratic 
ideas  both  at  school  and  through  the  mass  media.  These  Western 
ideas  became  the  norm  against  which  to  judge  the  government  in 
power  when  the  exigencies  of  the  war  period  were  removed. 

A  land  reform  law  enacted  in  June  1949  also  had  a  leveling  effect 
on  Korean  society.  Under  this  law,  nearly  1  million  sharecroppers, 
or  approximately  40  percent  of  total  farm  households,  became  small 
landowners.  The  reform  also  brought  about  the  decline  of  the  land- 
lord class  that  had  formed  the  backbone  of  traditional  Korean  society 
for  centuries.  Because  big  business  and  industrial  groups  did  not 
emerge  until  the  late  1950s  and  early  1960s,  almost  everyone  in  soci- 
ety was  placed  on  an  equal  footing. 

The  Korean  War  had  the  most  significant  effect  on  the  social 
system.  The  movement  of  large  armies  up  and  down  the  length  of 
the  peninsula  was  accompanied  by  civilian  refugees.  People  of  diverse 
backgrounds  intermingled  for  prolonged  periods,  deeply  affecting 
everyone's  way  of  life.  The  indiscriminate  destruction  of  property 
during  the  war  also  had  the  effect  of  homogenizing  Korean  society. 

The  war  caused  hundreds  of  thousands  of  young  men  from  rural 
areas  to  enlist  in  the  army,  exposing  them  to  modern  organiza- 
tion, technologies,  and  a  new  world  outlook.  The  war  also  gave 
rise  to  a  large  officer  corps  that  later  developed  into  an  increasingly 
significant  social  group. 

Better  education  and  the  government's  postwar  economic  poli- 
cies contributed  to  accelerated  urbanization.  Reconstruction  projects 
created  jobs  in  the  cities,  while  the  government's  effort  to  control 
the  prices  of  farm  products  made  it  unprofitable  to  till  small  farm 
plots.  The  urban  population  increased  rapidly  from  11.6  percent 


35 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

in  1940  to  24.4  percent  in  1955  and  28.3  percent  in  1960.  These 
changes  had  a  direct  impact  on  politics  because  the  better-educated 
and  urbanized  elements  became  increasingly  vocal  and  more  in- 
dependent in  their  political  judgments. 

The  Postwar  Economy 

The  war  had  destroyed  most  of  South  Korea's  production  facil- 
ities. The  South  Korean  government  began  rehabilitation  as  soon 
as  the  battle  zone  near  the  thirty-eighth  parallel  stabilized  in  1952. 
The  United  Nations  Korean  Reconstruction  Agency  and  members 
of  the  UN,  principally  the  United  States,  also  provided  badly  needed 
financial  assistance.  Seoul  depended  heavily  on  foreign  aid,  not 
only  for  defense,  but  also  for  other  expenditures.  Foreign  aid  con- 
stituted a  third  of  total  budget  in  1954,  rose  to  58.4  percent  in  1956, 
and  was  approximately  38  percent  of  the  budget  in  1960.  The  first 
annual  United  States  economic  aid  bill  after  the  armistice  was 
US$200  million;  aid  peaked  at  US$365  million  in  1956  and  was 
then  maintained  at  the  US$200  million  level  annually  until  the 
mid-1960s. 

The  scarcity  of  raw  materials  and  the  need  to  maintain  a  large 
army  caused  a  high  rate  of  inflation,  but  by  1958  prices  had  stabi- 
lized. The  government  also  intensified  its  effort  to  increase  indus- 
trial production,  emphasizing  power  generation  and  textile  and 
cement  production.  In  order  to  reduce  dependence  on  imports,  such 
principal  items  as  fertilizer  and  steel  began  to  be  produced  domes- 
tically. 

The  average  rise  in  the  gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glos- 
sary) was  5.5  percent  from  1954  through  1958.  Industrial  produc- 
tion led  the  advance,  growing  by  nearly  14  percent  per  year.  The 
tightening  of  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  in  1958,  coupled  with 
the  phasing  out  of  the  United  Nations  Korean  Reconstruction 
Agency  program  and  the  reduction  in  direct  aid  from  the  United 
States  in  1957,  caused  a  shortage  of  raw  materials  for  import- 
dependent  industries  and  led  to  an  overall  economic  decline.  By 
1958  Liberal  Party  leaders  paid  more  attention  to  political  survival 
than  to  economic  development.  The  government  adopted  a  com- 
prehensive Seven-Year  Economic  Development  Plan  in  January 
1960,  but  before  the  plan  could  be  implemented,  the  student  revo- 
lution brought  down  the  government. 

The  Democratic  Interlude 

Rhee's  resignation  left  a  political  void  subsequently  filled  by  Ho 
Chong,  whom  Rhee  had  appointed  foreign  minister  the  day  be- 
fore he  resigned.  Although  Ho  was  a  lifelong  friend  of  Rhee,  he  had 


36 


Historical  Setting 


maintained  amicable  relations  with  Democratic  Party  leaders  and 
thus  was  acceptable  to  all  concerned.  Between  April  and  July  1960, 
Ho's  transitional  government  maintained  order,  exiled  Rhee  and 
his  wife  to  Hawaii,  and  prepared  for  a  new  general  election  of  the 
National  Assembly  in  July.  That  body  revised  the  constitution  on 
June  15,  instituting  a  parliamentary  form  of  government  with  a 
bicameral  legislature.  In  the  July  election,  the  Democratic  Party 
won  175  of  the  233  seats  in  the  lower  house  of  the  National  Assem- 
bly. The  second  largest  group,  the  independents,  won  forty-nine 
seats.  The  Liberal  Party  won  only  two  seats.  In  the  upper  house, 
the  Democratic  Party  won  thirty-one  of  the  fifty-eight  seats. 

The  Democratic  Party  had  been  a  coalition  of  two  divergent  ele- 
ments that  had  merged  in  1955  to  oppose  Rhee.  When  the  com- 
mon enemy — Rhee  and  his  Liberal  Party — had  been  removed  from 
the  scene  and  opportunities  for  power  were  presented,  each  group 
sought  to  obtain  the  spoils  for  itself. 

The  Democratic  Party  candidate  for  the  presidency  in  the  March 
1960  election,  Cho  Pyong-ok,  died  of  illness  shortly  before  the  elec- 
tion, just  as  his  predecessor,  Sin  Ik-hui,  had  in  1956.  The  two 
groups  openly  struggled  against  each  other  during  the  July  elec- 
tions for  the  National  Assembly.  Although  they  agreed  on  Yun 
Po-son  as  presidential  candidate  and  Chang  Myon  as  their  choice 
for  premier,  neither  had  strong  leadership  qualities  nor  commanded 
the  respect  of  the  majority  of  the  party  elite.  Yun  and  Chang  could 
not  agree  on  the  composition  of  the  cabinet.  Chang  attempted  to 
hold  the  coalition  together  by  reshuffling  cabinet  positions  three 
times  within  a  five-month  period.  In  November  1960,  the  group 
led  by  Yun  left  the  Democratic  Party  and  formed  the  New 
Democratic  Party  (Simmindang) . 

In  the  meantime,  the  tasks  confronting  the  new  government  were 
daunting.  The  economy  suffered  from  mismanagement  and  cor- 
ruption. The  army  and  police  needed  to  be  purged  of  the  political 
appointees  who  had  buttressed  the  dictatorship.  The  students,  to 
whom  the  Democratic  Party  owed  its  power,  filled  the  streets  almost 
daily,  making  numerous  wide-ranging  demands  for  political  and 
economic  reforms,  but  the  Democratic  Party  had  no  ready-made 
programs.  Law  and  order  could  not  be  maintained  because  the 
police,  long  an  instrument  of  the  Rhee  government,  were  demoral- 
ized and  totally  discredited  by  the  public.  Continued  factional  wran- 
gling caused  the  public  to  turn  away  from  the  party. 

This  situation  provided  a  fertile  ground  for  a  military  coup. 
Whereas  Rhee  had  been  able  to  control  the  military  because  of 
his  personal  prestige,  his  skill  in  manipulating  the  generals,  and 
the  control  mechanisms  he  had  instituted,  Chang  lacked  all  these 


37

advantages.  When  the  demands  of  the  young  army  officers  under 
Major  General  Park  Chung  Hee  were  rebuffed,  and  as  political 
power  appeared  to  be  increasingly  hanging  in  the  balance  with  no 
one  clearly  in  charge,  the  army  carried  out  a  coup  d'etat  on  May 
16,  1961.  Chang's  own  army  chief  of  staff,  Chang  To-yong,  joined 
the  junta,  and  Chang's  fragile  government  was  toppled.  (The  junta 
subsequently  tried  and  convicted  General  Chang  for  attempting 
to  take  over  the  junta.)  The  young  officers'  initial  complaint  had 
been  that  Chang  Myon  had  not  kept  a  campaign  pledge  to  weed 
out  corrupt  generals  from  the  South  Korean  army,  and  some 
Korean  sources  attributed  this  failure  to  the  intervention  of  high- 
ranking  United  States  military  officers,  who  feared  the  weakening 
of  South  Korea's  national  security. 

Yun  Po-son  sided  with  the  junta  and  persuaded  the  United  States 
Eighth  Army  and  the  commanders  of  various  South  Korean  army 
units  not  to  interfere  with  the  new  rulers.  Yun  stayed  on  as  presi- 
dent for  ten  months  after  the  military  junta  took  over  power,  thereby 
legitimizing  the  coup.  A  small  number  of  young  officers  command- 
ing 3,600  men  had  succeeded  in  toppling  a  government  with 
authority  over  an  army  of  600,000. 

South  Korea  under  Park  Chung  Hee,  1961-79 

The  junta  under  Park  Chung  Hee  quickly  consolidated  its  power, 
removed  those  it  considered  corrupt  and  unqualified  from  govern- 
ment and  army  positions,  and  laid  plans  for  the  future.  The  thirty- 
two-member  Supreme  Council  for  National  Reconstruction  (SCNR) 
became  all-powerful. 

The  Korean  Central  Intelligence  Agency  (KCIA)  was  created 
in  June  1961  to  prevent  a  countercoup  and  to  suppress  all  poten- 
tial enemies.  It  was  to  have  not  only  investigative  power,  but  also 
the  power  to  arrest  and  detain  anyone  suspected  of  wrongdoing 
or  harboring  antijunta  sentiments.  The  KCIA  extended  its  power 
to  economic  and  foreign  affairs  under  its  first  director,  Colonel  (re- 
tired) Kim  Chong-p'il,  a  relative  of  Park,  and  one  of  the  original 
planners  of  the  coup  against  Chang. 

In  May  1961 ,  the  junta  pledged  to  make  an  all-out  effort  to  build 
a  self-reliant  economy  and  to  carry  out  a  "  great  human  revolu- 
tion" by  wiping  out  all  corruption  and  evil  practices  in  the  govern- 
ment and  by  introducing  a  "fresh  and  clean  morality."  The 
National  Assembly  was  dissolved,  and  high-level  civilian  officials 
were  replaced  by  military  officers.  By  1963  the  junta's  economic 
policies  had  not  produced  any  favorable  results. 

The  KCIA  under  Kim  Chong-p'il  was  involved  in  a  number 
of  scandals  that  considerably  tarnished  the  junta's  image.  The

military  leaders  had  worked  actively  to  establish  a  political  party, 
later  known  as  the  Democratic  Republican  Party  (DRP),  which 
existed  from  1963  to  1980,  in  preparation  for  the  return  of  politics 
to  the  civilians.  Former  politicians,  however,  were  prohibited  from 
engaging  in  organizational  activities.  Although  Park  had  announced 
in  February  1963  that  he  would  not  participate  in  civilian  politics, 
the  following  month  he  announced  a  popular  referendum  to  decide 
whether  the  junta  should  extend  its  rule  for  another  four  years. 
Facing  stiff  opposition  from  both  the  South  Korean  public  and  the 
United  States,  the  plan  for  a  referendum  was  canceled. 

The  Military  in  Politics 

The  junta  had  drawn  up  a  new  constitution  and  had  put  it  before 
a  popular  referendum  in  December  1962,  receiving  78.8  percent 
of  the  vote.  Under  the  new  constitution,  the  president  was  to  be 
elected  by  direct  popular  vote  and  have  strong  powers — including 
the  authority  to  appoint  the  premier  and  cabinet  members  without 
legislative  consent  and  to  order  emergency  financial  and  economic 
measures.  Under  United  States  pressure,  Park,  who  had  held  the 
position  of  acting  president  following  Yun's  resignation  in  March 
1962,  retired  from  the  army  as  a  four-star  general  and  ran  as  the 
DRP  candidate  in  the  October  1963  presidential  election.  He  was 
elected  by  a  narrow  margin,  winning  46.6  percent  of  the  vote,  as 
compared  with  45. 1  percent  for  Yun  Po-son,  the  New  Democratic 
Party  candidate.  In  the  subsequent  election  for  the  unicameral  legis- 
lature, held  in  November  1963,  the  government  won  110  of  the 
175  seats. 

Until  1971  South  Korea  operated  under  the  political  framework 
it  had  adopted  in  1963.  Even  though  Park  imposed  some  restric- 
tions on  members  of  the  press,  intellectuals,  and  opposition  politi- 
cians, these  groups  were  permitted  considerable  latitude  to  criticize 
the  government  and  to  engage  in  organizational  activities.  Although 
there  were  numerous  student  demonstrations,  particularly  in  1965 
when  the  government  normalized  its  relations  with  Japan  and  sent 
45,000  combat  troops  to  support  the  Republic  of  Vietnam  in 
response  to  a  request  from  the  United  States,  the  students  were 
controlled  and  there  were  no  casualties  in  confrontations  with  the 
police.  The  presidential  and  National  Assembly  elections  in  1967 
and  1971  were  closely  contested  but  won  by  Park.  In  order  to  suc- 
ceed himself  for  the  third  time  in  1971,  Park  amended  the  consti- 
tution in  1969. 

In  December  1971,  Park  again  tightened  his  control  over  the 
country.  He  proclaimed  a  national  emergency  and  forced  through 
the  National  Assembly  a  bill  granting  him  complete  power  to 


39

control,  regulate,  and  mobilize  the  people,  the  economy,  the  press, 
and  everything  else  in  the  public  domain.  In  October  1972,  he 
proclaimed  martial  law,  dissolved  the  National  Assembly,  closed 
all  universities  and  colleges,  imposed  strict  press  censorship,  and 
suspended  political  activities.  Within  a  few  days  he  "submitted" 
a  new  draft  constitution — designated  the  yusin  (revitalization) 
constitution — to  a  national  referendum.  The  1972  constitution  al- 
lowed Park  to  succeed  himself  indefinitely,  to  appoint  one- third 
of  the  National  Assembly's  members,  and  to  exercise  emergency 
powers  at  will.  The  president  was  to  be  chosen  by  the  more  than 
2,000  locally  elected  deputies  of  the  supposedly  nonpartisan  National 
Conference  for  Unification,  who  were  to  cast  their  votes  as  an  elec- 
toral college  without  debate. 

Students  and  intellectuals  conducted  a  national  campaign  to 
revise  the  1972  constitution  in  the  fall  of  1973.  As  the  student  cam- 
paign began  to  gather  momentum,  the  president  issued  his  first 
emergency  decree  in  January  1974  outlawing  all  such  campaigns. 
Successive  emergency  measures  imposed  further  restrictions  on 
other  segments  of  society,  but  the  harshest  and  most  comprehen- 
sive restrictions  were  imposed  by  Emergency  Measure  Number 
Nine,  issued  in  May  1975,  which  made  it  a  crime  either  to  criti- 
cize the  constitution  or  to  provide  press  coverage  of  such  an  activity, 
subject  to  a  penalty  of  more  than  a  year's  imprisonment.  Student 
participation  in  politics  or  coverage  of  student  political  activities 
in  the  press  were  subject  to  the  same  punishment.  The  president 
justified  the  harsh  measures  by  citing  the  need  for  national  unity 
in  the  face  of  an  alleged  threat  of  attack  from  North  Korea. 

Having  concentrated  all  power  around  himself,  Park  suppressed 
his  opponents  harshly.  KCIA  agents  abducted  Kim  Dae  Jung, 
Park's  opponent  in  the  1971  presidential  elections,  from  a  hotel 
in  Tokyo  in  August  1973,  precipitating  a  major  crisis  in  South 
Korean-Japanese  relations.  Kim  had  been  abroad  after  the  elec- 
tion and  remained  there  after  Park  declared  martial  law,  traveling 
between  Japan  and  the  United  States  and  conducting  anti-Park 
activities.  Students  demonstrating  against  the  yusin  constitution  were 
summarily  incarcerated.  In  March  1976,  prominent  political  lead- 
ers, including  former  President  Yun  and  presidential  candidate 
Kim,  issued  the  Democratic  Declaration  calling  for  the  restoration 
of  democracy.  Park  had  them  arrested  and  sentenced  to  five  to  eight 
years  in  prison. 

In  the  meantime,  Park  narrowly  avoided  an  assassination  at- 
tempt by  a  South  Korean  youth  (resident  in  Japan),  whose  stray 
bullets  killed  the  president's  wife  instead  in  August  1974.  After  this 
incident,  Park  became  more  reclusive  and  came  to  rely  more  and

more  on  his  chief  bodyguard,  Ch'a  Chi-ch'ol,  of  the  Presidential 
Security  Force. 

Force  alone  could  not  sustain  the  authoritarian  system.  Park's 
strongest  defense  against  his  critics  had  been  the  high  rate  of  eco- 
nomic growth  under  his  leadership  (see  The  Government  Role  in 
Economic  Development,  ch.  3).  By  1978,  however,  the  growth  rate 
had  begun  to  decline,  and  inflation  had  become  a  serious  problem. 
Seoul  successfully  weathered  the  first  "oil  shock"  when  Middle 
Eastern  suppliers  drastically  raised  prices  in  1973,  but  was  hard 
hit  by  the  second  shock  in  1978-79.  In  December  1978,  Park  be- 
latedly adopted  a  stabilization  plan  to  cool  down  the  economy,  but 
the  plan  caused  a  serious  recession,  leading  to  a  succession  of 
bankruptcies  and  increased  unemployment. 

The  first  overt  manifestation  of  workers'  discontent  appeared 
in  August  1979  with  demonstrations  by  200  women  employees  of 
the  Y.H.  Industrial  Company,  which  had  just  gone  bankrupt. 
Women  workers  occupied  the  headquarters  of  the  opposition  New 
Democratic  Party  and  demanded  the  right  to  manage  the  compa- 
ny themselves.  When  the  workers  refused  to  obey  the  government's 
order  to  disperse,  some  1,000  riot  policemen  raided  the  building. 
Pandemonium  occurred,  and  one  of  the  workers  died — it  was 
unknown  whether  she  had  jumped,  was  pushed,  or  was  jostled  to 
her  death.  Despite  the  government's  efforts,  the  "Y.H.  Incident" 
became  a  rallying  cry  of  the  opposition. 

Aside  from  the  visible  social  unrest  caused  by  political  suppres- 
sion and  economic  recession,  the  opposition  camp  had  reason  to 
become  emboldened  in  its  criticism  of  the  government  in  1979.  Dis- 
affection was  particularly  severe  in  urban  areas.  Although  the  New 
Democratic  Party  was  suffering  from  internal  dissension,  it  won 
a  plurality  in  the  December  1978  general  elections  for  the  Nation- 
al Assembly,  the  first  general  elections  to  be  held  since  1973.  In 
the  1978  elections,  the  Democratic  Republican  Party  won  only  30.9 
percent  of  the  popular  vote,  a  decline  of  7.8  percent  from  1973. 
In  contrast,  the  opposition  obtained  34.7  percent,  an  increase  of 
2.2  percent  from  1973.  Independent  candidates  won  27.2  percent 
of  the  vote  (twenty-two  seats  in  the  National  Assembly);  fifteen  of 
the  twenty-two  subsequently  joined  the  New  Democratic  Party, 
although  three  were  "persuaded"  to  switch  to  the  government 
party.  Because  one-third  of  the  National  Assembly's  members  were 
government- appointed,  the  opposition  could  not  command  a 
majority. 

The  new  leader  of  the  New  Democratic  Party,  Kim  Young 
Sam,  began  his  challenge  to  the  government  in  June  1979.  He  an- 
nounced to  the  foreign  press  his  readiness  to  meet  with  Kim  II  Sung, 


41 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

the  North  Korean  president,  to  discuss  matters  relating  to  unifi- 
cation and  delivered  a  scathing  attack  on  the  government  in  the 
National  Assembly.  He  argued  that  the  government  had  been  in 
power  too  long  and  had  been  clearly  discredited  by  the  elections; 
that  Emergency  Measure  Number  Nine  suffocated  peoples'  free- 
dom and  was  clearly  unconstitutional;  that  Seoul  had  colluded  with 
hoodlums  to  assault  the  New  Democratic  Party  headquarters  and 
to  harass  him;  that  the  suppression  of  human  rights  had  become 
an  international  disgrace;  that  the  people  should  be  permitted  to 
elect  their  own  president  through  direct  elections  and  be  allowed 
to  live  without  fear;  and  that  a  fair  distribution  of  wealth  should 
be  permitted  without  government  interference.  The  government 
immediately  retaliated  and  ousted  Kim  from  the  National  Assem- 
bly. In  a  show  of  solidarity,  all  opposition  members  of  the  Nation- 
al Assembly  resigned  on  October  13,  1979. 

The  Y.H.  Incident  and  the  harsh  confrontation  between  the 
government  and  the  opposition  parties  agitated  the  college  students. 
Students  in  Taegu  and  Seoul  staged  campus  rallies  and  demon- 
strations in  September  1979.  In  mid-October,  students  in  Pusan 
poured  into  the  streets  and  clashed  with  police,  leading  the  govern- 
ment to  declare  martial  law  in  that  city.  In  late  October,  students 
in  Masan  launched  a  demonstration.  The  government  placed  the 
city  under  4  'garrison  decree, ' '  and  the  army  took  over  the  respon- 
sibility for  public  order. 

Close  Park  associates  such  as  Kim  Chong-p'il  were  reported  to 
have  counseled  the  president  to  meet  some  of  the  student  demands 
and  reduce  repression,  but  were  opposed  by  presidential  security 
chief  Gh'a  Chi-ch'ol.  Ch'a  also  sharply  disagreed  with  Kim  Chae- 
gyu,  the  director  of  the  KCIA,  who  had  counseled  moderation  in 
the  government's  handling  of  the  student  protesters.  On  October 
26,  1979,  the  nation's  most  powerful  figures — Park,  Ch'a,  and  Kim 
Chae-gyu — met  in  a  KCIA  safe  house  restaurant  for  dinner  to  dis- 
cuss, among  other  things,  the  Pusan  situation.  In  the  sharply  divided 
discussion  that  followed,  Kim  gunned  down  Park,  Ch'a,  and  their 
bodyguards. 

It  could  be  argued  that  Park  had  created  his  own  dilemma  by 
instituting  the  yusin  constitution  and  by  assuming  unlimited  pow- 
ers. If  he  had  loosened  control,  however,  the  demand  for  reforms 
might  have  spread,  proving  impossible  to  contain.  The  system  had 
provided  for  neither  a  pressure-release  valve  nor  an  escape  hatch. 

In  his  eighteen  years  in  power  (1961-79),  Park  had  been  obsessed 
with  ushering  the  country  into  the  ranks  of  developed  nations,  had 
pursued  his  goal  relentlessly,  and  had  achieved  considerable  results. 
Having  been  trained  under  the  Japanese,  he  closely  patterned  his 


42 


Historical  Setting 


development  strategies  after  Japan's,  where  a  feudal  society  had 
been  turned  into  a  modern  nation  between  the  1860s  and  1930s. 

The  Japanese  leaders  of  the  Meiji  era  (1868-1912),  however, 
possessed  two  advantages  over  Park.  First,  they  had  operated  in 
a  period  when  the  masses  were  less  politically  conscious  and 
authoritarian  control  was  more  easily  accepted.  This  was  not  the 
situation  in  South  Korea,  where  students  had  already  toppled  a 
government  in  1960.  Second,  the  Japanese  also  had  a  built-in  sys- 
tem of  checks  and  balances  because  the  top-echelon  leaders  oper- 
ated in  a  council  where  different  leaders  interacted  among 
themselves  as  equals.  Park,  by  contrast,  operated  on  a  one-man- 
rule  basis,  unchecked  by  constraints  on  his  own  decision-making 
powers. 

Economic  Development 

South  Korea's  economy  grew  rapidly  under  Park.  The  military 
leaders,  with  little  previous  political  or  administrative  experience, 
and  lacking  a  developmental  program,  later  turned  to  the 
economists  and  planners  for  assistance.  The  Economic  Planning 
Board  was  established  in  1961.  A  program  of  rapid  industrializa- 
tion based  on  exports  was  launched.  The  shift  in  orientation  was 
reflected  in  the  First  Five-Year  Economic  Development  Plan 
(1962-66),  and  the  subsequent  second  (1967-71),  third  (1972-76), 
and  fourth  (1977-81)  five-year  economic  development  plans. 

Park's  policies  encouraged  private  entrepreneurs.  Businesses  were 
given  powerful  incentives  to  export,  including  preferential  treat- 
ment in  obtaining  low-interest  bank  loans,  import  privileges,  per- 
mission to  borrow  from  foreign  sources,  and  tax  benefits.  Some 
of  these  businesses  later  became  the  chaebol  (see  Glossary;  The  Ori- 
gins and  Development  of  Chaebol,  ch.  3). 

Toward  these  ends,  the  currency  was  drastically  devalued  in  1961 
and  1964,  and  import  quotas  for  raw  materials  eased.  Private  saving 
was  encouraged  by  raising  interest  rates,  and  funds  were  borrowed 
from  abroad.  Exports  also  were  encouraged  by  direct  subsidies; 
all  taxes  and  restrictions  on  the  import  of  intermediate  goods  that 
were  to  be  used  to  produce  export  products  were  removed.  As  the 
existing  industries — textiles,  clothing,  and  electrical  machinery, 
among  others — had  been  stagnant  because  of  a  lack  of  imported 
raw  materials,  these  policies  produced  immediate  results. 

These  developmental  programs  required  enormous  amounts  of 
capital.  As  the  level  of  United  States  assistance  stabilized,  the  Park 
regime  turned  to  "financial  diplomacy"  with  other  countries.  The 
normalization  of  relations  with  Japan  in  1965  brought  Japanese 
funds  in  the  form  of  loans  and  compensation  for  the  damages 


43 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

suffered  during  the  colonial  era.  Park  made  a  state  visit  to  the  Fed- 
eral Republic  of  Germany  in  1964  that  resulted  in  the  extension 
of  government  aid  and  commercial  credits.  The  availability  of  funds 
and  the  increasing  level  of  exports  elevated  Seoul's  credit  rating, 
making  it  possible  to  increase  borrowing  in  the  open  international 
market.  Further,  the  conflict  in  Indochina  stimulated  economic 
growth.  Seoul's  export  drive  also  owed  much  to  the  availability 
of  an  educated  labor  force  and  a  favorable  international  market. 

South  Korean  businesses  discovered  that  they  could  successfully 
compete  abroad.  As  idle  capacity  was  used  up  and  the  demand  for 
new  manufacturing  investment  rose,  increasing  numbers  of  for- 
eign investors  were  attracted  to  South  Korea. 

Foreign  exchange  earnings  improved  as  export  and  foreign 
receipts  rose.  The  government  also  took  steps  to  increase  tax 
revenues  and  stabilize  consumer  prices.  Much  of  the  price  stabiliza- 
tion program  was  carried  out  at  the  expense  of  farmers,  who  were 
forced  to  accept  the  government's  policy  of  low  grain  prices.  Agricul- 
tural development  lagged  behind  until  1971,  when  the  government 
shifted  to  a  policy  of  high  grain  prices  and  inaugurated  the  Sae- 
maul  undong  (New  Community  Movement)  aimed  at  improving 
the  farm  village  environment  and  increasing  agricultural  produc- 
tion and  income  (see  The  Agricultural  Crisis  of  the  Late  1980s, 
ch.  3). 

Official  statistics  indicated  rapid  economic  growth.  Substantial 
successes  were  achieved  under  the  first  two  five-year  economic  devel- 
opment plans.  The  manufacturing  sector  provided  the  main  stimu- 
lus, growing  by  15  percent  and  21  percent,  respectively,  during 
the  two  plans.  Domestic  savings  rates  grew  and  exports  expanded 
significantly  (see  Economic  Plans,  ch.  3).  A  new  economic  strategy 
emphasizing  diversification  in  production  and  trade  proved  gener- 
ally successful  in  the  1970s.  Under  the  third  plan,  the  government 
made  a  bold  move  to  expand  South  Korea's  heavy  and  chemical 
industries,  investing  in  steel,  machinery,  shipbuilding,  electron- 
ics, chemicals,  and  nonferrous  metals.  South  Korea's  capability 
for  steel  production  and  oil  refining  rose  most  notably.  Refineries 
for  zinc  and  copper  and  modern  shipbuilding  facilities  were  con- 
structed; automobiles  began  to  be  exported  to  a  few  markets.  The 
plan  sought  to  better  prepare  South  Korea  for  competition  in  the 
world  market  and  to  facilitate  domestic  production  of  weaponry. 

The  quadrupling  of  oil  prices  beginning  in  1973  severely  threat- 
ened the  South  Korean  economy,  which  depended  heavily  on 
imported  oil  for  energy  production.  Construction  contracts  in  the 
Middle  East,  however,  provided  the  necessary  foreign  exchange 


44

to  forestall  a  balance-of-payments  crisis  and  to  continue  the  high 
rate  of  growth. 

The  growth-oriented  economic  strategy  emphasizing  exports  in- 
evitably produced  side  effects.  Although  the  government  previously 
had  been  able  to  manage  these  side  effects  and  effectively  surmount 
various  economic  crises,  the  situation  began  to  deteriorate  in  1978. 
The  emphasis  on  exports  had  produced  a  shortage  of  domestic  con- 
sumer goods  that  was  exacerbated  by  the  increasing  demands 
brought  about  by  rising  wages  and  the  advance  in  living  standards. 
Price  controls  imposed  on  producers  of  consumer  goods  discouraged 
the  manufacture  of  these  goods.  Meanwhile,  the  inflow  of  dollars 
rapidly  expanded  the  money  supply  and  inflation  became  a  seri- 
ous problem.  According  to  a  Bank  of  Korea  report,  consumer  prices 
rose  only  14.4  percent  in  1978,  but  most  observers  agreed  that  the 
actual  rate  was  near  30  percent. 

The  high  rate  of  inflation  continued  into  1979.  According  to  a 
report  issued  by  the  Economic  Planning  Board  in  August  1979, 
the  average  household's  cost  of  living  had  gone  up  26.3  percent 
from  the  previous  year.  Although  wages  had  been  rising  rapidly 
during  the  previous  several  years — spurred  by  shortages  of  skilled 
and  semiskilled  workers — the  rise  in  wages  began  to  slow  down. 
The  average  wage  increased  1 2  percent  during  the  year  preceding 
August  1979. 

To  address  these  ills,  Park  had  replaced  the  economic  team  in 
the  cabinet  in  December  1978  and  adopted  stabilization  measures 
entailing  the  lowering  of  the  growth  rate:  a  stringent  tight-money 
policy;  a  switch  of  investment  capital  planned  for  heavy  industries 
to  light  industries  producing  consumer  products;  a  reduction  of 
price  controls  to  encourage  more  production  of  consumer  goods; 
and  assistance  for  the  poor.  But  these  measures  caused  a  reces- 
sion, produced  a  succession  of  bankruptcies  among  small  and  medi- 
um loan-dependent  enterprises,  and  increased  unemployment. 

Society  under  Park 

The  rapid  pace  of  industrialization  not  only  changed  much  of 
the  South  Korean  landscape,  as  farmlands  were  converted  into  high- 
ways and  factory  sites,  but  also  profoundly  modified  social  struc- 
ture, social  values,  and  behavior.  As  late  as  1965,  some  58.7  percent 
of  the  labor  force  was  engaged  in  agriculture  and  fishery,  but  the 
percentage  declined  to  50.4  percent  in  1970  and  38.4  percent  in 
1978.  The  percentage  of  workers  engaged  in  secondary  industries, 
including  mining  and  manufacturing,  rose  from  10.3  percent  in 
1965  to  35.2  percent  in  1970  and  38.4  percent  in  1978.  Industri- 
alization led  to  a  rapid  increase  in  South  Korea's  urban  population, 


45 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

which  rose  from  28.3  percent  of  the  total  in  1960  to  54.9  percent 
in  1979.  Rapid  urbanization  compounded  the  problems  of  hous- 
ing, transportation,  sanitation,  and  pollution,  and  exacerbated  other 
social  problems. 

Improved  living  standards  and  ever-increasing  job  opportuni- 
ties accelerated  the  desire  among  South  Koreans  for  education,  par- 
ticularly at  secondary  schools  and  institutions  of  higher  learning. 
In  1960  about  one-third  of  children  between  twelve  and  fourteen 
years  of  age  attended  middle  schools;  that  proportion  increased  to 
53.3  percent  in  1970  and  74.0  percent  in  1975.  In  1960  some  19.9 
percent  of  the  population  between  fifteen  and  seventeen  years  of 
age  attended  high  schools;  that  proportion  increased  to  29.3  per- 
cent in  1970  and  40.5  percent  in  1975.  By  1970  about  9.3  percent 
of  college-age  youths  attended  colleges  and  universities,  and  the 
number  of  university  graduates  exceeded  30,000  a  year.  Eight  years 
later,  41,680  students  graduated  from  four- year  institutions  of 
higher  learning  (see  Education,  ch.  2). 

Most  workers  with  higher  education  qualifications  were  absorbed 
by  the  rapidly  growing  industrial  and  commercial  sectors,  joining 
the  ranks  of  the  growing  middle  class.  Demands  and  rewards  for 
people  in  the  more  prestigious  fields — doctors,  lawyers,  economists, 
scientists,  and  managers — were  increasing.  The  number  of  white- 
collar  workers  in  commerce,  industry,  banking,  civil  service,  and 
the  teaching  profession  also  rose,  as  did  the  number  of  small  en- 
trepreneurs and  retailers. 

A  high  proportion  of  those  people  who  regarded  themselves  as 
middle  class  resided  in  Seoul,  the  locale  for  much  of  the  nation's 
wealth,  talent,  and  many  of  its  cultural  resources.  As  beneficiaries 
of  the  rapidly  expanding  economy,  much  of  the  middle  class  either 
was  content  with  its  situation  or  indifferent  to  politics.  Many  highly 
educated  persons  in  this  group  who  found  themselves  in  less  well- 
paid  positions  than  they  would  have  liked  remained  dissatisfied, 
and  together  with  students  and  intellectuals  they  formed  the  core 
of  opposition  to  the  Park  regime. 

Rural  villages  also  underwent  changes  of  revolutionary  propor- 
tions, particularly  after  1971.  As  the  government  had  emphasized 
industrial  growth  and  slighted  the  agrarian  sector,  agricultural 
production  lagged;  its  annual  rate  of  growth  during  the  1967-72 
period  was  only  about  2.5  percent.  With  overall  GNP  growing  at 
over  10  percent  a  year  during  the  same  period,  the  rural  economy 
steadily  lost  ground,  until  by  1969  farm  income  was  only  a  little 
more  than  half  that  earned  by  urban  workers.  This  situation  con- 
tributed to  the  high  rate  of  migration  to  the  cities  and  eroded  po- 
litical support  for  the  president  (see  Agriculture,  ch.  3). 


46 


Historical  Setting 


This  situation  led  the  government  to  take  active  measures  to  in- 
crease farm  productivity  and  income  in  1971.  Government  subsi- 
dies to  farmers  were  increased  by  setting  relatively  high  prices  for 
grains.  Higher-yield  rice  varieties  were  introduced.  Advanced 
agricultural  technology  was  made  more  widely  available  through 
extension  services,  and  more  fertilizers  and  credits  were  provided. 
As  a  result  of  these  measures,  farm  productivity  and  farm  income 
increased  very  rapidly  during  the  ensuing  years,  and  the  rate  of 
emigration  to  the  cities  tapered  off. 

The  Saemaul  Movement  was  instituted  with  great  fanfare  by 
Park  in  the  fall  of  1971 .  The  movement  was  envisioned  as  a  higlily 
organized,  intensively  administered  campaign  to  improve  the  ' 'en- 
vironment" quality  of  rural  life  through  projects  undertaken  by  the 
villagers  themselves  with  government  assistance.  The  bureaucracy, 
particularly  at  the  regional  and  local  levels,  was  mobilized  on  a 
massive  scale  to  ensure  that  the  program  would  be  carried  through 
to  completion  in  all  36,000  villages.  The  initial  emphasis  was  on 
improving  village  roads  and  bridges  and  replacing  thatch  with  tile 
or  composition  roofs. 

The  momentum  was  maintained  and  increased  in  subsequent 
years  as  the  Saemaul  Movement  evolved  into  a  major  ideological 
campaign  aimed  at  the  psychological  mobilization  of  the  entire  coun- 
try in  support  of  "nation  building."  During  the  first  two  or  three 
years,  emphasis  continued  to  be  on  improving  the  village  environ- 
ment, but  later  focus  was  shifted  toward  projects  designed  to  raise 
agricultural  productivity  and  farm  income. 

As  local  government  officials  were  jolted  out  of  their  traditional 
lethargy  by  the  continuing  insistence  of  higher  authorities  that 
essential  services  be  delivered  to  farmers,  the  farmers  began  to  have 
ready  access  to  agricultural  extension  services,  rural  credit,  and 
market  information.  The  result  of  improved  services  and  increased 
resource  allocation  was  that  farmers  became  more  confident  of  their 
ability  to  improve  the  village  environment  through  their  own 
cooperative  efforts  and  became  more  convinced  of  the  usefulness 
of  outside  official  help.  As  a  result  of  the  Saemaul  Movement,  about 
85  percent  of  villages  had  electricity,  and  about  60  percent  of  farm 
households  had  television  sets  by  the  late  1970s.  Some  85  percent 
of  rural  children  continued  from  free,  obligatory  primary  school- 
ing to  middle  school,  and  over  50  percent  of  these  middle  school 
pupils  were  entering  high  schools.  Many  farmers  also  acquired 
modern  amenities  that  had  been  available  only  to  city  dwellers  just 
a  decade  earlier,  such  as  sewing  machines,  radios,  irons,  and  wall 
clocks.

Foreign  Relations 

Relations  with  North  Korea 

Even  though  the  Korean  War  ended  in  a  truce  agreement  in 
July  1953,  a  high  level  of  tension  remained  between  the  two  coun- 
tries. Although  North  Korea  presented  numerous  proposals  for 
peaceful  unification  after  signing  the  truce,  none  was  premised  on 
the  notion  of  the  continuation  of  the  existing  South  Korean  govern- 
ment, which  made  the  proposals  unacceptable  to  Seoul. 

Throughout  the  Park  era,  relations  with  North  Korea  were 
marked  by  mutual  distrust  and  discord,  with  only  a  brief  respite 
between  July  1972  and  June  1973  when  the  two  sides  engaged  in 
high-level  negotiations.  Hopes  were  raised  that  tensions  might  be 
reduced  and  a  way  toward  unification  of  the  divided  nation  found. 
Entrenched  suspicions  made  the  contentious  issues  separating  the 
two  sides  even  more  difficult  to  solve,  and  the  talks  were  broken 
off  (see  Relations  with  North  Korea,  ch.  4).  Meanwhile,  the  armed 
confrontation  continued  (see  The  Threat  from  the  North,  ch.  5). 

The  continuing  failure  of  the  negotiations  reflected  the  depth  of 
the  gap  separating  the  two  Koreas — particularly  noteworthy  in  view 
of  the  mellowing  international  environment  evidenced,  for  exam- 
ple, by  China's  much-improved  relations  with  both  the  United 
States  and  Japan.  There  were  indications  that  both  China  and  the 
United  States  exerted  considerable  influence  on  the  Korean  negoti- 
ations, but  without  marked  effect.  Leaders  in  the  north  and  the 
south  found  their  ideologies  and  aims  totally  incompatible.  South 
Korea's  leaders  were  determined  to  keep  their  society  free  from 
communism,  while  North  Korea's  leaders  were  committed  to  the 
cause  of  bringing  "people's  democratic  revolution"  to  the  south. 

Relations  with  Japan 

The  most  important  development  in  South  Korea's  diplomacy 
under  Park  was  the  normalization  of  relations  with  Japan.  Although 
South  Korea  had  traded  with  Japan  since  1948  and  the  two  coun- 
tries had  engaged  in  negotiations  since  1951,  disagreement  on  a 
number  of  issues  had  prevented  diplomatic  ties.  The  junta  under 
Park  actively  sought  to  normalize  relations.  Negotiations  resumed 
in  October  1961 ,  culminating  in  an  agreement  in  June  1965  to  es- 
tablish diplomatic  relations  (see  Relations  with  Japan,  ch.  4).  Park 
settled  for  a  fraction  of  the  "reparations"  earlier  demanded  by 
Rhee,  and  Japanese  fishermen  were  given  access  to  South  Korean 
waters  outside  of  the  three-mile  territorial  limit  (Rhee  had  prohib- 
ited Japanese  fishermen  from  coming  any  closer  than  the  medial 
line  between  Japan  and  Korea).  Under  the  treaty,  the  Japanese 


50 


Historical  Setting 


government  was  to  provide  the  capital  necessary  for  an  industri- 
alization program  and  to  open  up  ever- increasing  loans,  invest- 
ments (both  public  and  private),  and  trade  (see  Foreign  Economic 
Relations,  ch.  3).  The  treaty  normalizing  relations  was  denounced 
as  a  sellout  by  the  opposition  and  the  intellectuals  and  touched  off 
prolonged,  widespread  student  demonstrations. 

South  Korean-Japanese  relations  since  normalization  have  been 
amicable,  but  were  considerably  strained  by  the  abduction  from 
Tokyo  of  Kim  Dae  Jung  in  August  1973,  which  resulted  in  long 
and  embarrassing  negotiations.  In  1979  South  Korean-Japanese 
relations  entered  a  new  era  as  the  two  countries  began  informal 
ties  on  defense  matters,  such  as  the  establishment  of  the  Korean- 
Japanese  Parliamentary  Conference  on  Security  Affairs. 

Relations  with  the  United  States 

South  Korea  continued  to  depend  on  United  States  military  as- 
sistance. In  spite  of  initial  United  States  hesitation  about  support- 
ing Park  in  1961,  the  two  countries  maintained  close  economic, 
military,  and  diplomatic  ties.  South  Korea  dispatched  combat  troops 
to  the  Republic  of  Vietnam  (South  Vietnam)  in  1965  to  augment 
United  States  forces  there,  and  President  Lyndon  B.  Johnson  paid 
a  personal  visit  to  Seoul  in  October  1966  to  show  his  appreciation. 

Friction  began  to  develop  in  the  Washington- Seoul  relationship 
after  the  United  States  withdrew  one  of  its  two  divisions  from  South 
Korea  in  1971  and  intensified  after  Park  instituted  rigorous  authori- 
tarian measures  under  his  1972  constitution.  This  tension  led  to 
an  accelerated  effort  by  the  Park  government  to  gain  support  in 
the  United  States  Congress.  The  methods  used  by  Seoul's  lobbyists 
ultimately  resulted  in  the  embarrassing  "Koreagate"  affair  of  1977, 
involving  former  Ambassador  Kim  Dong-jo  and  rice  dealer  Park 
Tong  Sun.  Investigations  by  the  Ethics  Committee  and  by  the  Sub- 
committee on  International  Organizations  of  the  Committee  on 
International  Relations  of  the  United  States  House  of  Represen- 
tatives received  much  press  coverage  and  weakened  United  States 
support  for  South  Korea. 

During  his  presidential  election  campaign  in  1976,  Jimmy  Carter 
pledged,  if  elected,  to  withdraw  all  combat  troops  from  South  Korea. 
His  victory  aggravated  United  States-South  Korean  relations  con- 
siderably (see  Relations  with  The  United  States,  ch.  4).  In  March 
1977,  the  United  States  decided  to  withdraw  its  ground  combat 
forces  over  a  four-to-five  year  period.  Some  3,600  troops  subse- 
quently were  withdrawn,  but  further  reductions  were  suspended 
in  1979.  In  the  meantime,  President  Carter  and  the  Congress  con- 
tinued to  press  for  the  improvement  of  the  human  rights  climate 


51 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

in  South  Korea.  Relations  between  the  two  countries  were  at  a  low 
point  in  1979,  just  before  Park's  assassination.  In  early  1981,  Presi- 
dent Ronald  Reagan's  administration  announced  that  further  with- 
drawals were  not  being  considered. 

The  Transition 

Soon  after  Park's  October  26,  1979  assassination,  South  Korea 
went  through  kaleidoscopic  changes — intense  and  open  competi- 
tion for  power,  student  upheavals,  a  military  takeover,  a  gruesome 
massacre,  and  the  emergence  of  a  new  authoritarian  order.  Since 
Park  had  concentrated  virtually  all  political  power  around  him- 
self, his  assassination  created  a  political  vacuum.  One  of  his  main 
pillars  of  power,  the  director  of  the  Presidential  Security  Force, 
was  assassinated  with  him;  the  director  of  the  other  major  political 
instrument,  the  KCIA,  was  quickly  arrested  by  the  Martial  Law 
Command  for  conducting  the  assassinations.  In  addition,  the 
National  Assembly,  one-third  of  its  members  presidential  appoin- 
tees, had  been  rendered  impotent  by  the  yusin  constitution. 

Ch'oe  Kyu-ha,  premier  under  Park,  was  elected  president  in 
December  1979  by  the  National  Conference  for  Unification,  a  rub- 
ber stamp  electoral  college.  Ch'oe  had  no  independent  political  base. 
He  reaffirmed  the  need  for  a  new  constitution  in  his  December 
21  inaugural  speech,  stating  that  a  new  constitution  supported  by 
a  majority  of  the  people  would  be  adopted  within  a  year  and  that 
a  fair  general  election  would  be  held  soon  afterward. 

Even  before  his  inauguration,  Ch'oe,  as  acting  president,  had 
abolished  Emergency  Measure  Number  Nine.  Several  hundred  in- 
dividuals serving  prison  terms  or  being  investigated  on  charges  of 
violating  that  decree  were  released  on  December  8.  One  of  those 
benefiting  from  the  release  was  Kim  Dae  Jung,  who  had  been  un- 
der house  arrest  and  whose  civil  rights  were  to  be  restored  on  Febru- 
ary 29,  1980.  Also  affected  were  student  activists  who  had  been 
arrested  for  staging  campus  demonstrations. 

Lieutenant  General  Chun  Doo  Hwan,  the  head  of  the  Defense 
Security  Command,  was  responsible  for  conducting  the  investiga- 
tion of  Park's  assassination.  Chun  used  the  factionalism  rife  with- 
in the  military  to  assert  his  control  over  the  army  on  December 
12,  1979.  He  promptly  set  about  uprooting  the  Park-era  power 
elite  and  building  a  new  political  base.  This  power  play,  combined 
with  increasing  social  and  labor  unrest,  economic  instability,  and 
the  factionalism  within  and  between  the  ruling  and  opposition  par- 
ties, set  the  scene  for  the  military's  consolidation  of  power  and  cul- 
minated in  Chun's  assumption  of  the  presidency  in  August  1980. 

Politics  in  South  Korea  in  1980  mainly  revolved  around  framing 


52 


Historical  Setting 


a  new  constitution.  The  principal  opposition  party,  the  New 
Democratic  Party  under  Kim  Young  Sam,  advocated  concluding 
the  process  by  August  15,  but  President  Ch'oe,  evidently  under 
military  pressure,  was  not  ready  to  expedite  the  constitutional 
process.  The  scheduling  issue  led  to  a  major  student  upheaval  in 
May  1980,  followed  by  a  military  takeover. 

The  Democratic  Republican  Party 

In  the  meantime,  the  country  underwent  a  brisk  process  of  poli- 
tical realignment.  Although  Park  had  organized  and  headed  the 
Democratic  Republican  Party  in  1963  to  mobilize  mass  support 
behind  his  regime,  by  1972  he  had  discarded  it  when  he  imposed 
the  yusin  constitution.  As  a  result,  the  DRP  had  only  a  nominal 
existence  at  the  time  of  Park's  death.  It  was  incumbent  upon  the 
new  president  of  the  DRP,  Kim  Chong-p'il,  to  revive  the  party. 
The  DRP  had  suffered  a  disastrous  loss  in  the  December  1978  Na- 
tional Assembly  elections.  This  situation  led  to  a  call  for  "rectifi- 
cation" (chongp'ung)  within  the  party,  which  meant  removing  certain 
top  leaders  who  had  attracted  notoriety  for  illicit  wealth  and  un- 
democratic political  behavior. 

The  New  Democratic  Party 

The  New  Democratic  Party  (NDP),  the  principal  opposition 
party,  also  had  its  share  of  problems.  Kim  Young  Sam  was  elected 
as  NDP  leader  for  three  years  in  1979,  so  his  position  would  have 
been  secure  had  not  the  Ch'oe  government  restored  Kim  Dae 
Jung's  civil  rights.  Even  though  Kim  Dae  Jung,  the  NDP  presiden- 
tial candidate  in  1971 ,  had  been  out  of  the  political  arena  for  more 
than  seven  years,  he  commanded  a  large  political  following.  Be- 
cause the  NDP  was  expected  to  win  the  forthcoming  election  by 
a  wide  margin,  the  presidency  of  the  republic  was  at  stake  in  the 
negotiations  for  Kim  Dae  Jung's  reinstatement  in  the  party.  In 
the  end,  negotiations  broke  off,  and  on  April  7,  1980,  Kim  Dae 
Jung  declared  that  he  would  no  longer  seek  to  rejoin  the  NDP. 

Although  Kim  Young  Sam  and  his  supporters  had  waged  a  fierce 
political  struggle  against  President  Park  toward  the  end  of  his  rule, 
many  of  those  in  leadership  positions  in  the  NDP  had  tended  to 
be  accommodating  to  the  Park  regime.  Kim  Dae  Jung  and  his  fol- 
lowers, on  the  other  hand,  represented  the  active  dissident  students, 
intellectuals,  and  progressive  Christians  who  had  engaged  in  direct 
struggle  against  the  Park  regime.  The  chaeya  serydk  (literally,  forces 
in  the  field,  but  the  term  also  means  an  opposing  political  force) 
were  more  radical  in  orientation.  Kim  Dae  Jung  and  his  group 


53 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

wished  to  expedite  the  process  of  restoring  democracy,  even  if  it 
meant  forcing  the  hands  of  Ch'oe  and  his  supporters. 

Students  in  1980 

While  professional  politicians  engaged  in  the  struggle  for  realign- 
ment, college  students  were  restless  for  action.  The  students  ini- 
tially were  concerned  with  campus  affairs.  As  soon  as  the  new 
semester  began  in  March  1980,  students  on  various  campuses  began 
to  demand  the  removal  of  professors  with  close  ties  to  the  Park 
regime  and  of  university  owner-presidents  who  had  amassed  for- 
tunes by  operating  their  institutions.  They  also  demanded  autonomy 
from  government  control.  The  students  held  rallies  and  on-campus 
demonstrations  and  in  some  cases  occupied  college  offices.  As  a 
result  of  the  unrest,  many  university  presidents  resigned. 

In  early  May  1980,  however,  the  students'  slogans  began  to 
change.  Students  demanded  that  martial  law  be  lifted  immediately 
and  that  the  "remnants  of  the yusin  system,"  including  Chun,  be 
removed.  They  also  demanded  the  guarantee  of  labor  rights,  the 
removal  of  "compradore  capital,"  and  the  protection  of  farmers' 
rights.  Although  student  demonstrations  had  been  confined  to  their 
campuses  when  the  issues  raised  concerned  institutional  matters, 
they  now  began  to  spill  out  into  the  streets. 

The  massive  demonstrations  by  the  students  continued  until  May 
16,  when  Premier  Sin  Hyon-hwak  promised  that  the  government 
would  attempt  to  speed  up  the  process  of  adopting  a  new  constitu- 
tion. Ch'oe  even  shortened  his  Middle  Eastern  trip  by  a  day  and 
returned  home  on  the  evening  of  May  1 7 .  Student  demonstrations 
paralyzed  the  nation  and  sent  politicians  and  government  leaders 
to  their  council  meetings.  According  to  an  unconfirmed  report,  Sin 
even  offered  his  resignation  to  the  president  upon  his  return  and 
advised  the  president  to  remove  Chun. 

General  Chun  Doo  Hwan  Takes  Over 

Whatever  counsel  the  civilian  leaders  may  have  offered  Ch'oe, 
the  military's  position  prevailed.  Chun  Doo  Hwan,  as  head  of  the 
Defense  Security  Command,  had  already  replaced  the  army  chief 
of  staff  in  December  1979  and  had  taken  the  command  of  the  KCIA 
in  April  1980. 

Chun's  methodical  and  speedy  actions  after  May  17  clearly  re- 
vealed that  he  had  a  well-laid  plan.  He  issued  a  decree  closing  down 
the  colleges  and  universities  and  prohibiting  all  political  gather- 
ings. All  publications  and  broadcasts  were  to  receive  prior  censor- 
ship, criticism  of  the  incumbent  and  past  presidents  was  outlawed, 
and  the  manufacture  and  spreading  of  rumors  were  forbidden. 


54 


Historical  Setting 


Chun's  plan  aimed  not  only  at  quelling  demonstrations  but  also 
at  destroying  the  power  base  of  all  existing  political  figures  and 
groups. 

The  arrest  of  Kim  Dae  Jung  and  other  arch  enemies  of  Park 
was  to  be  expected  as  soon  as  the  military  stepped  in  on  May  1 7 . 
But  the  arrest  of  Kim  Chong-p'il  and  other  people  who  had  been 
influential  under  Park  came  as  a  total  surprise. 

The  Kwangju  Uprising 

Chun's  hard-line  policy  led  to  a  confrontation  in  Kwangju,  a 
city  of  600,000  people  located  170  miles  south  of  Seoul,  in  South 
Cholla  Province,  the  scene  of  an  uprising  and  bloodbath  between 
May  18  and  27.  As  noted  in  a  report  issued  by  the  Martial  Law 
Command,  the  students  and  ''hot-blooded  young  soldiers"  con- 
fronted each  other;  angry  citizens  joined  in,  driven  by  alleged 
rumors  that  the  ■ 1  soldiers  of  Kyongsang  Province  origin  came  to 
exterminate  the  seeds  of  the  Cholla  people." 

The  Kwangju  massacre  was  to  became  an  important  landmark 
in  the  struggle  for  South  Korean  democracy.  It  heightened  provin- 
cial hostility  and  marked  the  beginning  of  the  rise  of  anti-American 
sentiment  in  South  Korea. 

According  to  the  report,  the  sequence  of  events  was  triggered 
by  student  demonstrations  on  the  morning  of  May  18  in  defiance 
of  the  new  edict.  Some  200  Chonnam  University  students  began 
demonstrating  in  the  morning,  and  by  2:00  P.M.  they  had  been 
joined  by  more  than  800  additional  demonstrators.  City  police  were 
unable  to  control  the  crowd.  At  about  4:00  P.M.,  the  Martial  Law 
Command  dispatched  a  Special  Forces  detachment  consisting  of 
paratroopers  trained  for  assault  missions.  The  report  did  not  men- 
tion it,  but  the  paratroopers  killed  a  large  number  of  people. 

On  May  20,  some  10,000  people  demonstrated  in  Kwangju.  On 
May  21,  the  Special  Forces  were  withdrawn,  and  the  city  was  left 
to  the  rioters.  A  memorial  service  was  held  on  May  24,  with  ap- 
proximately 15,000  citizens  in  attendance. 

On  May  25,  approximately  50,000  people  gathered  for  a  rally 
and  adopted  a  resolution  calling  for  the  abolition  of  martial  law 
and  the  release  of  Kim  Dae  Jung.  A  committee  of  leading  citizens 
was  organized  on  May  23  to  try  to  settle  the  impasse,  but  "im- 
pure elements"  and  "maneuverers  behind  the  scene"  allegedly  ob- 
structed an  effective  solution.  On  May  27,  at  3:30  A.M.,  an  army 
division  that  had  been  circling  the  city  for  three  days  launched  an 
attack.  After  light  skirmishes,  the  army  quashed  the  revolt  in  less 
than  two  hours.  The  army  arrested  1 ,740  rioters,  of  whom  730  were 
detained  for  investigation.

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

A  number  of  conclusions  can  be  drawn  from  the  Martial  Law 
Command's  account.  The  uprising  started  with  student  demon- 
strations. The  Martial  Law  Command  dispatched  assault  troops 
whose  random  killings  angered  citizens  who  had  not  participated 
in  the  initial  student  demonstrations.  According  to  later  reports 
by  the  command,  nearly  200  persons  were  killed,  including  22  sol- 
diers and  4  policemen;  of  the  civilians  killed,  only  17  died  on  the 
final  day  of  assault.  And,  regardless  of  who  spread  the  "wanton 
rumors,"  they  evidently  were  credible  enough  to  prompt  the  gather- 
ing of  50,000  Kwangju  citizens. 

Chun,  touring  the  city  after  the  revolt  had  ended,  told  the  peo- 
ple of  Kwangju  not  to  make  an  issue  of  what  had  happened,  but 
to  learn  from  it.  The  specter  of  Kwangju,  however,  was  to  haunt 
him  for  years  to  come. 

There  were  several  aftereffects  resulting  from  the  Kwangju  in- 
cident. It  deepened  the  chasm  that  had  existed  between  the  Kyong- 
sang  provinces  (from  which  Park  and  Chun  originated)  and  the 
Cholla  provinces,  of  which  Kwangju  is  a  capital  and  from  which 
the  opposition  leader  Kim  Dae  Jung  came  (see  Population  Settle- 
ment Patterns,  ch.  2).  The  United  States'  role  also  was  controver- 
sial. General  John  A.  Wickham,  Jr.  had  released  South  Korean 
troops  from  the  South  Korea-United  States  Combined  Forces  Com- 
mand to  end  the  rebellion,  and  President  Reagan  had  strongly  en- 
dorsed Chun's  actions  (see  Relations  with  the  United  States,  ch.  4). 

The  Chun  Regime 

Having  suppressed  the  Kwangju  uprising  with  brute  force, 
General  Chun  Doo  Hwan  further  tightened  his  grip  on  the  govern- 
ment. He  and  three  of  his  close  associates  served  as  the  core  of 
the  junta  committee,  known  as  the  Special  Committee  for  National 
Security  Measures.  The  three  were  Lieutenant  General  Ch'a  Kyu- 
hon  (deputy  chief  of  staff  of  the  army),  Major  General  Roh  Tae 
Woo  (commander  of  the  Capital  Garrison  Command),  and  Major 
General  Chong  Ho-yong  (commander  of  the  Special  Forces).  The 
junta  vested  in  itself  the  authority  to  pass  laws  and  to  make  all  de- 
cisions affecting  the  state  until  a  new  National  Assembly  came  into 
being. 

On  August  5,  1980,  Chun  promoted  himself  from  lieutenant 
general  to  full  general  in  preparation  for  retiring  from  the  army 
on  August  22.  On  August  27  he  was  elected  president  by  the 
National  Conference  for  Unification,  receiving  2,524  of  the  2,525 
votes  cast.  The  single  dissenting  vote  was  invalidated  for  an 
unknown  reason. 


56 


Historical  Setting 


Chun  presented  his  objective  at  his  September  1 ,  1980,  inaugu- 
ration: to  create  a  new  society  where  all  past  corrupt  practices  would 
be  replaced  by  mutual  trust  and  justice.  In  order  to  accomplish 
this  goal,  he  planned  to  remove  the  old  politicians  from  the  scene; 
only  those  certified  as  "clean"  would  be  permitted  to  participate 
in  building  the  new  order. 

In  the  economic  field,  Chun  intended  to  do  away  with  excessive 
protection  of  industries  and  to  encourage  creativity.  An  increase 
in  employment  opportunities  would  be  facilitated,  and  coopera- 
tion and  coprosperity  between  labor  and  management  would  be 
brought  about.  Farmers'  income  would  be  increased  by  continu- 
ing the  Saemaul  Movement. 

The  1980  Constitution 

One  of  Chun's  inaugural  promises  was  the  promulgation  of  a 
new  constitution  and  the  holding  of  a  national  referendum  to  ap- 
prove it.  On  September  29,  1980,  the  government  announced  the 
draft  of  a  constitution  that  in  many  ways  was  the  most  democratic 
South  Korea  had  ever  had — except  for  the  supplementary  provi- 
sions and  the  procedure  for  presidential  election.  The  guarantee 
of  peoples'  democratic  rights  was  absolute,  including  the  right  to 
privacy  in  communications,  the  prohibition  of  torture,  and  the  in- 
admissability  in  court  trials  of  confessions  obtained  by  force.  The 
president,  who  was  to  be  elected  by  an  electoral  college  and  to  serve 
a  single  seven-year  term,  was  given  strong  powers,  including  the 
right  to  dissolve  the  National  Assembly,  which  in  turn  could  bring 
down  cabinets  but  not  the  president.  In  the  event  that  the  consti- 
tution was  amended  to  extend  the  president's  term  of  office,  such 
changes  were  not  to  be  applied  to  the  incumbent.  The  document 
received  the  overwhelming  approval  of  the  voters — 91 .6  percent — at 
the  national  referendum  held  on  October  22,  1980. 

The  constitution,  however,  was  a  "promissory  note."  Until  the 
new  National  Assembly  was  elected  and  inaugurated,  the  Legisla- 
tive Council  for  National  Security,  to  be  appointed  by  Chun,  would 
enact  all  laws.  A  supplementary  provision  in  the  constitution  also 
called  for  the  dissolution  of  all  existing  political  parties.  In  effect, 
by  offering  to  bring  in  a  democratic  government  by  June  1981, 
Chun  had  obtained  a  mandate  to  change  the  political  landscape 
in  whatever  form  he  chose.  The  new  constitution  placed  South 
Korea  under  a  constitutional  dictatorship  from  October  1980  to 
June  1981. 

Purges 

Chun  zealously  pushed  his  campaign  to  weed  out  corruption. 


57 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

The  clean-up  campaign  began  in  May  1980  when  Kim  Chong- 
p'il  and  others  were  forced  to  give  up  their  wealth  and  retire  from 
politics.  In  June  some  300  senior  KCIA  agents  were  dismissed. 
In  July  1980,  more  than  230  senior  officials,  including  former  cabi- 
net officers,  were  dismissed  on  corruption  charges.  The  ax  also  fell 
on  4,760  low-level  officials  in  the  government,  state-owned  firms, 
and  banks,  with  the  proviso  that  the  former  officials  not  be  rehired 
by  such  firms  within  two  years.  The  Martial  Law  Command  ar- 
rested 1 7  prominent  politicians  of  both  the  government  and  oppo- 
sition parties  for  investigation  and  removed  some  400  bank  officials, 
including  4  bank  presidents  and  21  vice  presidents.  The  govern- 
ment also  announced  the  dismissal  of  1 ,819  officials  of  public  enter- 
prises and  affiliated  agencies,  including  39  (some  25  percent)  of 
the  presidents  and  vice  presidents  of  such  enterprises  and  banks 
and  128  board  directors  (more  than  22  percent). 

The  "clean-up  campaign"  also  extended  to  the  mass  media.  On 
July  31 ,  1980,  the  172  periodicals  that  allegedly  caused  "social  decay 
and  juvenile  delinquency"  were  summarily  abolished,  among  them 
some  of  the  finest  intellectual  magazines  of  liberal  inclination  and 
prestigious  journals  for  general  audiences.  This  action  resulted  in 
the  dismissal  of  hundreds  of  journalists  and  staff.  The  daily 
newspapers  not  affected  by  the  purge  also  were  directed  to  weed 
out  "corrupting,"  that  is,  liberal  writers  (see  The  Media,  ch.  4). 

Chun's  "Cultural  Revolution" 

In  the  wake  of  Chun's  purge,  the  government  also  launched  a 
massive  reeducation  program  for  the  nation's  elites.  High  govern- 
ment officials,  judges,  prosecutors,  business  executives,  college 
professors,  and  their  spouses — 32,000  persons  in  all — were  brought 
together  for  an  intensive  three-day  training  program  at  Saemaul's 
New  Community  Training  Centers  in  Suwon  and  elsewhere.  The 
training  regimen  included  morning  exercises,  environmental 
cleanup,  lectures  on  the  New  Community  Movement,  and  discus- 
sion sessions  on  "the  proper  way  of  life." 

This  training  program,  initiated  under  Park's  regime,  eventu- 
ally was  to  be  extended  to  the  general  public.  In  August  1980,  the 
government  launched  another  massive  propaganda  campaign,  or- 
ganizing "Bright  Society  Rallies"  in  major  cities  where  tens  of  thou- 
sands of  citizens  were  mobilized  to  hear  speeches.  In  addition, 
"Cleansing  Committees"  were  established  at  all  levels  of  govern- 
ment down  to  the  local  ward  (ri  and  dong)  levels  (see  Local  Ad- 
ministration, ch.  4).

Historical  Setting 


Economic  Performance 

The  new  regime  inherited  an  economy  suffering  from  all  the  side 
effects  of  Park's  export-oriented  development  program  and  policy 
of  expanding  heavy  and  chemical  industries  (see  Economic  Develop- 
ment, this  ch.;  Industrial  Policies,  ch.  3).  The  international  eco- 
nomic environment  of  the  early  1980s  was  extremely  unfavorable, 
a  situation  that  further  restricted  South  Korea's  exports.  It  was 
necessary,  therefore,  for  the  Chun  regime  to  concentrate  on  stabili- 
zation, and  it  devoted  its  first  two  years  to  controlling  inflation  while 
attempting  to  bring  about  economic  recovery.  Investment  was 
redirected  from  the  capital-intensive  heavy  and  chemical  industries 
towards  labor-intensive  light  industries  that  produced  consumer 
goods.  Import  restrictions  were  lifted. 

The  economy  began  to  improve  in  1983  because  of  stringent  anti- 
inflationary  measures  and  the  upturn  in  the  world  economy.  While 
South  Korea  had  suffered  a  negative  growth  rate  in  1980,  it  at- 
tained an  8.1  percent  growth  rate  in  1983.  Exports  began  increas- 
ing in  mid- 1983  and  the  economy  began  to  gain  strength.  A  good 
harvest  in  1983  also  helped.  South  Korea  attained  its  1983  export 
target  of  US$23.5  billion,  a  7.6  percent  increase  from  1982. 

In  December  1983,  Seoul  unveiled  its  revised  Fifth  Five- Year 
Economic  and  Social  Development  Plan.  The  plan  called  for  steady 
growth  for  the  next  three  years,  low  inflation,  and  sharply  reduced 
foreign  borrowing.  Exports  were  to  rise  by  15  percent  a  year,  infla- 
tion was  projected  to  be  held  at  1.8  percent,  and  per  capita  GNP 
was  to  rise  to  US$2,325  by  1986.  The  annual  growth  rate  was  plan- 
ned to  average  7.5  percent  though  the  actual  performance  was 
higher.  The  real  GNP  growth  rate  was  7  percent  in  1985,  but  for 
the  next  three  years  12.9  percent,  12.8  percent,  and  12.2  percent, 
respectively. 

Foreign  Policy 

United  States 

One  of  the  most  salient  elements  of  the  Chun  regime  was  its  close 
ties  with  the  Reagan  administration.  The  ties  were  in  sharp  con- 
trast to  the  strained  Washington-Seoul  relationship  under  presi- 
dents Carter  and  Park,  when  the  United  States  government  had 
criticized  Park's  dictatorial  policies  and  attempted  to  implement 
Carter's  campaign  pledge  to  withdraw  United  States  ground  combat 
troops  from  South  Korea.  The  relationship  also  had  been  strained 
because  of  the  1977  Koreagate  scandal. 

Reagan  provided  unmitigated  support  to  Chun  and  to  South 


59 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

Korea's  security.  Chun  was  Reagan's  first  official  guest  in  the  White 
House.  Reagan  reaffirmed  his  support  of  Chun  by  visiting  Seoul 
in  November  1983. 

While  Reagan's  support  considerably  buttressed  Chun's  stature 
in  domestic  politics  and  the  international  arena,  it  also  fueled  the 
subculture  of  anti- Americanism.  The  opposition  forces  in  South 
Korea,  suffering  from  the  government's  stringent  suppression, 
denounced  United  States'  support  for  the  Chun  regime  as  a  cal- 
lous disregard  for  human  rights  and  questioned  the  United  States' 
motives  in  Korea.  The  past  image  of  the  United  States  as  a  staunch 
supporter  of  democracy  in  South  Korea  was  replaced  with  that  of 
defender  of  its  own  interests,  a  policy  impervious  to  injustices  com- 
mitted in  South  Korea.  This  view  was  accentuated  by  the  fact  that 
Chun's  White  House  visit  occurred  only  several  months  after  the 
Martial  Law  Command  had  brutally  suppressed  the  student  up- 
rising in  Kwangju.  (It  was  later  revealed  by  Richard  V.  Allen,  Na- 
tional Security  Advisor  to  President  Reagan,  that  Chun's  visit  was 
part  of  Washington's  diplomatic  effort  to  spare  the  life  of  Kim  Dae 
Jung,  who  had  been  sentenced  to  death.)  This  atmosphere  led  some 
of  South  Korea's  radical  elements  to  take  extreme  measures,  such 
as  arson  committed  at  the  United  States  Information  Service  build- 
ing in  Pusan  in  March  1982  and  the  occupation  of  the  United  States 
Information  Service  Library  in  Seoul  in  May  1985.  Students  who 
demonstrated  against  the  Chun  government  invariably  carried  anti- 
American  slogans. 

Japan 

The  Chun  government  also  brought  about  a  significant  change 
in  South  Korea's  relations  with  Japan.  In  1981  Chun  utilized  the 
United  States'  support  and  its  strategy  of  allocating  greater  respon- 
sibility to  Japan  in  the  East  Asian  region  to  persuade  Tokyo  to 
grant  Seoul  a  large  public  loan.  The  negotiations  lasted  until  early 
1983  and  aroused  many  conflicting  emotions  in  both  countries. 
However,  Chun  was  able  to  obtain  a  US$4  billion  low-interest  loan 
that  significantiy  contributed  to  boosting  South  Korea's  credit  rating 
and  to  accelerating  its  economic  recovery;  Seoul's  foreign  debt  had 
reached  US$41  billion  at  the  end  of  1983  and  was  badly  in  need 
of  an  improved  credit  rating.  Japanese  prime  minister  Nakasone 
Yasuhiro  capped  the  negotiation  process  by  paying  a  state  visit  to 
Seoul  in  January  1983.  Whereas  other  Japanese  prime  ministers 
had  visited  Seoul  for  inaugurations  or  funerals,  this  was  the  first 
state  visit  to  South  Korea  by  a  Japanese  leader  since  the  country 
was  liberated  from  Japan  in  1945. 


60 


Historical  Setting 


China  and  the  Soviet  Union 

Chun  continued  Park's  policy  of  improving  relations  with  Chi- 
na and  the  Soviet  Union  and  attached  considerable  importance  to 
these  two  countries,  long  the  allies  of  North  Korea.  Beijing  and 
Moscow  were  thought  to  have  much  influence  in  charting  the  fu- 
ture of  the  Korean  Peninsula  and  were  thus  a  part  of  Nordpolitik 
(see  Relations  with  the  Soviet  Union;  Relations  with  China,  ch.  4). 

Seoul's  official  contact  with  Beijing  was  facilitated  by  the  land- 
ing of  a  hijacked  Chinese  civilian  airliner  in  May  1983.  China  sent 
a  delegation  of  thirty-three  officials  to  Seoul  to  negotiate  the  return 
of  the  airliner,  marking  the  beginning  of  frequent  exchanges  of  per- 
sonnel. For  example,  in  March  1984,  a  South  Korean  tennis  team 
visited  Kunming  for  a  Davis  Cup  match  with  a  Chinese  team.  In 
April  1984,  a  thirty-four-member  Chinese  basketball  team  arrived 
in  Seoul  to  participate  in  the  Eighth  Asian  Junior  Basketball  Cham- 
pionships. Some  Chinese  officials  reportedly  paid  quiet  visits  to 
South  Korea  to  inspect  its  industries,  and  South  Korean  officials 
visited  China  to  attend  various  international  conferences.  Since  Chi- 
na and  South  Korea  began  indirect  trade  in  1975,  the  volume  has 
steadily  increased  (see  Foreign  Trade  Policy,  ch.  3). 

The  Soviet  Union's  unofficial  relationship  with  South  Korea  be- 
gan in  1973,  when  it  permitted  South  Koreans  to  attend  an  inter- 
national conference  held  in  the  Soviet  Union.  In  October  1982, 
a  Soviet  official  attended  an  international  conference  in  South  Korea 
on  the  preservation  of  cultural  relics.  The  uproar  following  the 
Korean  Air  (KAL)  007  incident  in  September  1983,  when  the  Soviet 
air  force  shot  down  the  KAL  passenger  airplane,  brought  about 
a  hiatus  in  contacts,  but  the  unofficial  relationship  resumed  in  1988. 

The  Demise  of  the  Chun  Regime 

Even  though  Chun  Doo  Hwan's  government  had  attained  con- 
siderable results  in  economy  and  diplomacy,  his  government  failed 
to  win  public  trust  or  support.  In  spite  of  Chun's  lofty  pronounce- 
ments, the  public  basically  regarded  Chun  as  a  usurper  of  power 
who  had  deprived  South  Korea  of  its  opportunity  to  restore 
democracy.  Chun  lacked  political  credentials;  his  access  to  power 
derived  from  his  position  as  the  head  of  the  Defense  Security 
Command — the  army's  nerve  center  of  political  intelligence — and 
his  ability  to  bring  together  his  generals  in  the  front  lines. 

Chun  and  his  military  followers  failed  to  overcome  the  stigma 
of  the  Kwangju  incident,  and  the  new  "just  society"  that  he 
promised  did  not  materialize.  In  fact,  between  1982  and  1983,  at 
least  two  of  the  major  financial  scandals  in  South  Korea  involved 


61 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

Chun's  in-laws.  The  Chun  government's  slogans  became  hollow. 
While  Park  had  gained  respect  and  popularity  through  the  record- 
breaking  pace  of  economic  development,  Chun  could  not  repeat 
such  a  feat.  In  the  1985  National  Assembly  elections,  opposition 
parties  together  won  more  votes  than  the  government  party,  clearly 
indicating  that  the  public  wanted  a  change.  Moreover,  increasing 
numbers  of  people  had  become  more  sympathetic  to  the  students, 
who  presented  increasingly  radical  demands. 

One  of  the  most  serious  problems  the  government  faced  was  that 
the  argument  for  restricting  democracy  became  less  and  less  credi- 
ble. The  people  had  long  been  tolerant  of  various  restrictions  im- 
posed by  succeeding  governments  because  of  the  perceived  threat 
from  the  north,  but  the  consensus  eroded  as  the  international  en- 
vironment moderated.  More  and  more  people  became  cynical  about 
repeated  government  pronouncements,  viewing  them  as  self-serving 
propaganda  by  those  in  power.  This  tendency  was  particularly 
pronounced  among  the  post-Korean  War  generation  that  constitut- 
ed a  majority  of  the  South  Korean  population. 

The  unpopular  Chun  regime  and  its  constitutional  framework 
was  brought  down  in  1987  largely  by  the  student  agitation  that 
beset  the  regime.  Student  activists  set  the  tone  and  agenda  of  the 
society  as  a  whole  because  the  government  and  the  government- 
controlled  press  had  lost  their  credibility.  The  opposition  parties 
worked  with  the  students,  although  they  disagreed  on  the  ultimate 
aim — the  politicians  wanted  reform,  while  the  students  demanded 
revolution.  The  opposition  politicians  wanted  constitutional  reform 
to  replace  the  existing  system  of  electing  the  president  through  the 
handpicked  electoral  college  with  direct  popular  election.  The  stu- 
dents attacked  not  only  the  military  leaders  in  power  but  also  the 
entire  socio-political  and  economic  establishment. 

A  small  number  of  confirmed  radicals  led  the  student  movement. 
They  argued  that  the  basic  cause  for  the  political  and  social  malaise 
in  South  Korea  was  "American  imperialism,"  which  they  believed 
had  dominated  South  Korea  ever  since  it  was  liberated  from  Japan 
in  1945.  In  their  view,  "American  imperialism"  buttressed  the 
military  dictatorship  and  the  exploitative  capitalist  system;  the  strug- 
gle against  the  military  dictatorship  and  American  imperialism  was 
inseparable.  This  position  was  the  same  argument  that  North  Korea 
had  been  advancing  since  1946,  but  a  more  important  source  of 
intellectual  persuasion  came  from  the  revisionist  school  of  histori- 
ography that  swept  United  States  academia  during  the  1970s. 

The  revisionist  argument  was  very  similar  to  that  of  Lenin  on 
imperialism.  The  Cold  War  was  seen  as  the  inevitable  outcome  of 
the  United  States  capitalist  system's  need  for  continuous  economic

expansion  abroad.  United  States  participation  in  the  Korean  War 
and  the  subsequent  stationing  of  United  States  forces  in  South  Korea 
satisfied  such  a  need,  according  to  this  perspective.  For  the  revi- 
sionists, it  was  irrelevant  that  the  United  States  had  decided  to  aban- 
don Korea  in  September-October  1947,  or  that  the  United  States 
had  withdrawn  its  occupation  forces  from  South  Korea  in  1949. 
The  communist  countries,  whether  the  Soviet  Union  or  North 
Korea,  were  seen  as  passive  entities  reacting  against  the  aggres- 
sive actions  of '  'American  imperialists' '  rather  than  pursuing  their 
own  goals.  The  fact  that  the  United  States  had  interjected  itself 
into  the  Korean  War  in  1950,  and  that  it  continued  to  station  its 
troops  in  South  Korea  after  the  war,  was  evidence  enough. 

The  revisionist  arguments  found  a  fertile  soil  among  the  univer- 
sity students.  The  inquisitive  students  had  long  viewed  the  one- 
sided anticommunist  propaganda  emanating  from  official  and 
established  sources  as  stifling  and  as  leaving  too  many  questions 
unanswered.  The  new  arguments  sounded  logical  and  convincing, 
particularly  when  some  of  the  revisionists  took  liberty  with  histor- 
ical evidence.  Increasing  numbers  of  students  took  to  the  streets 
to  denounce  the  military  dictatorship  and  American  imperialism. 

Initially,  the  public  was  apathetic  to  the  confrontation  between 
the  student  demonstrators  and  government,  but  the  daily  fracas 
on  the  streets  and  the  never-ending  smell  of  tear  gas  aroused  their 
ire.  The  news  about  the  torture  and  death  of  a  student,  Pak  Chong- 
ch'ol,  by  the  police  touched  the  sore  nerves  of  the  people.  Presi- 
dent Chun  attempted  to  squash  the  opposition  by  issuing  a  decla- 
ration on  April  13,  1987,  to  suspend  the  ''wasteful  debate"  about 
constitutional  reform  until  a  new  government  was  installed  at  the 
end  of  his  seven-year  term.  The  declaration  was,  instead,  his  re- 
gime's swan  song.  Chun  wanted  to  have  his  successor  "elected" 
by  his  handpicked  supporters;  the  public  greeted  the  declaration 
with  universal  outrage.  Even  the  Reagan  administration,  which 
had  been  taciturn  about  South  Korea's  internal  politics,  urged  the 
Chun  government  not  to  ignore  the  outrage.  Finally,  on  June  29, 
1987,  Roh  Tae  Woo,  the  government  party's  choice  as  Chun's  suc- 
cessor, made  a  dramatic  announcement  in  favor  of  a  new  democratic 
constitution  that  embodied  all  the  opposition's  demands.

George  McAfee  McCune's  Korea  Today  is  particularly  valuable  for 
the  period  between  1945  and  1948.  The  period  of  Japanese  colonial

A  number  of  books  treat  Korea  in  the  modern  era,  although  most 
of  them  emphasize  the  political  aspect  of  the  society.  Gregory 
Henderson's  book  is  particularly  valuable  for  its  treatment  of 
modern  and  contemporary  periods  through  the  late  1960s.  The  1961

FEW  SOCIETIES  HAVE  CHANGED  as  rapidly  or  as  dramati- 
cally since  the  end  of  World  War  II  as  that  of  the  Republic  of  Korea 
(South  Korea).  When  the  war  ended  in  1945,  the  great  majority 
of  the  people  living  in  the  southern  half  of  the  Korean  Peninsula 
were  poor  peasants.  The  Japanese  colonial  regime  from  1910  to 
1945  had  promoted  modernization  of  the  economy  and  society.  The 
regime's  efforts,  however,  had  a  limited,  and  mainly  negative,  im- 
pact on  most  Koreans  inasmuch  as  the  main  intent  of  the  modern- 
ization program  was  to  serve  Japan.  The  poverty  and  distress  of 
the  South  Koreans  were  deepened  by  the  Korean  War  of  1950-53 
when  numerous  people  died  and  cities  and  towns  were  devastated. 
During  the  next  four  decades,  however,  South  Korea  evolved  into 
a  dynamic,  industrial  society.  By  1990  educational  and  public  health 
standards  were  high,  most  people  lived  in  urban  areas,  and  a  com- 
plex structure  of  social  classes  had  emerged  that  resembled  the  social 
structures  of  developed  Western  countries  or  Japan.  The  country 
also  was  making  substantial  progress  in  its  evolution  from  a  mili- 
tary dictatorship  similar  to  that  of  many  Third  World  regimes  to 
a  democratic,  pluralistic  political  system.  In  the  mid-1950s,  few 
observers  could  have  imagined  that  Seoul,  the  country's  capital, 
would  emerge  from  the  devastation  of  war  to  become  one  of  the 
world's  most  vibrant  metropolitan  centers — rivaling  Tokyo,  Hong 
Kong,  and  Los  Angeles. 

Colonial  occupation,  war,  and  the  tragedy  of  national  division 
fostered  abrupt  social  changes.  Rapid  economic  growth  engendered 
profound  changes  in  values  and  human  relationships.  Yet  there 
also  was  continuity  with  the  past.  Confucian  and  neo-Confucian 
ideas  and  institutions,  which  flourished  during  the  Choson  Dynasty 
(1392-1910),  continued  to  have  an  important  impact  in  1990.  The 
Confucian  influence  was  most  evident  in  the  tremendous  value 
placed  on  education,  a  major  factor  in  South  Korea's  economic 
progress.  Equally  evident  was  the  persistence  of  hierarchical,  often 
authoritarian,  modes  of  human  interaction  that  reflected  neo- 
Confucianism's  emphasis  on  inequality. 

The  complex  kinship  structures  of  the  past,  sanctified  by  Con- 
fucianism, had  eroded  because  of  urbanization  but  did  not  disap- 
pear. In  1990  Koreans  were  more  likely  to  live  in  nuclear  families 
than  their  parents  or  grandparents,  but  old  Confucian  ideas  of  filial 
piety  still  were  strong.  At  the  same  time,  contemporary  social  values 
were  influenced  by  traditional  but  non-Confucian  Korean  values,

such  as  shamanism  and  Buddhism,  and  by  ideas  brought  into  the 
country  from  the  West  and  Japan. 

The  population  of  the  Korean  Peninsula,  sharing  a  common  lan- 
guage, ethnic  identity,  and  culture,  was  one  of  the  world's  most 
homogeneous.  Although  there  were  significant  regional  differences 
even  within  the  relatively  small  land  area  of  South  Korea,  neither 
the  Democratic  People's  Republic  of  Korea  (North  Korea)  nor 
South  Korea  had  significant  non-Korean  ethnic  minorities.  This 
homogeneity,  and  the  sense  of  a  shared  historical  experience  that 
it  promoted,  gave  the  people  of  South  Korea  a  strong  sense  of 
national  purpose.  However,  the  years  of  Japanese  colonial  rule, 
the  division  of  the  peninsula  after  World  War  II,  the  establishment 
of  two  antagonistic  states  in  the  north  and  south,  and  the  profound 
changes  in  the  economy  and  society  caused  by  industrialization  and 
urbanization  since  the  1950s  led  many  South  Koreans  to  search 
anew  for  their  national  identity  and  place  in  the  world.  Often,  the 
concern  for  identity  expressed  itself  as  xenophobia,  the  creation 
of  a  "national  mythology"  that  was  given  official  or  semiofficial 
sanction,  or  the  search  for  the  special  and  unique  "essence"  of 
Korean  culture. 

Physical  Environment 
Land  Area  and  Borders 

The  Korean  Peninsula  extends  for  about  1,000  kilometers  south- 
ward from  the  northeast  part  of  the  Asian  continental  landmass. 
The  Japanese  islands  of  Honshu  and  Kyushu  are  located  some  200 
kilometers  to  the  southeast  across  the  Korea  Strait;  the  Shandong 
Peninsula  of  China  lies  190  kilometers  to  the  west.  The  west  coast 
of  the  peninsula  is  bordered  by  the  Korea  Bay  to  the  north  and 
the  Yellow  Sea  to  the  south;  the  east  coast  is  bordered  by  the  Sea 
of  Japan  (known  in  Korea  as  the  East  Sea).  The  8,640-kilometer 
coastline  is  highly  indented.  Some  3,579  islands  lie  adjacent  to  the 
peninsula.  Most  of  them  are  found  along  the  south  and  west  coasts. 

The  northern  land  border  of  the  Korean  Peninsula  is  formed 
by  the  Yalu  and  Tumen  rivers,  which  separate  Korea  from  the 
provinces  of  Jilin  and  Liaoning  in  China.  The  original  border 
between  the  two  Korean  states  was  the  thirty-eighth  parallel  of  lati- 
tude. After  the  Korean  War,  the  Demilitarized  Zone  (DMZ — see 
Glossary)  formed  the  boundary  between  the  two.  The  DMZ  is  a 
heavily  guarded,  4, 000-meter- wide  strip  of  land  that  runs  along 
the  line  of  cease-fire,  the  Demarcation  Line  (see  Glossary),  from 
the  east  to  the  west  coasts  for  a  distance  of  241  kilometers  (238  kilo- 
meters of  that  line  form  the  land  boundary  with  North  Korea). 


70 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


The  total  land  area  of  the  peninsula,  including  the  islands,  is 
220,847  square  kilometers.  Some  44.6  percent  (98,477  square 
kilometers)  of  this  total,  excluding  the  area  within  the  DMZ,  con- 
stitutes the  territory  of  the  Republic  of  Korea.  The  combined  ter- 
ritories of  North  Korea  and  South  Korea  are  about  the  same  size 
as  the  state  of  Minnesota.  South  Korea  alone  is  about  the  size  of 
Portugal  or  Hungary  and  is  slightly  larger  than  the  state  of  Indiana. 

The  largest  island,  Cheju,  lies  off  the  southwest  corner  of  the 
peninsula  and  has  a  land  area  of  1,825  square  kilometers.  Other 
important  islands  include  Ullung  in  the  Sea  of  Japan  and  Kangh- 
wa  Island  at  the  mouth  of  the  Han  River.  Although  the  eastern 
coastline  of  South  Korea  is  generally  unindented,  the  southern  and 
western  coasts  are  jagged  and  irregular.  The  difference  is  caused 
by  the  fact  that  the  eastern  coast  is  gradually  rising,  while  the 
southern  and  western  coasts  are  subsiding. 

Lacking  formidable  land  or  sea  barriers  along  its  borders  and 
occupying  a  central  position  among  East  Asian  nations,  the  Korean 
Peninsula  has  served  as  a  cultural  bridge  between  the  mainland 
and  the  Japanese  archipelago.  Korea  contributed  greatly  to  the  de- 
velopment of  Japan  by  transmitting  both  Indian  Buddhist  and 
Chinese  Confucian  culture,  art,  and  religion.  At  the  same  time, 
Korea's  exposed  geographical  position  left  it  vulnerable  to  inva- 
sion by  its  stronger  neighbors.  When,  in  the  late  nineteenth  cen- 
tury, British  statesman  Lord  George  Curzon  described  Korea  as 
a  "sort  of  political  Tom  Tiddler's  ground  between  China,  Rus- 
sia, and  Japan,"  he  was  describing  a  situation  that  had  prevailed 
for  several  millennia,  as  would  be  tragically  apparent  during  the 
twentieth  century. 

Topography  and  Drainage 

Early  European  visitors  to  Korea  remarked  that  the  land  resem- 
bled "a  sea  in  a  heavy  gale"  because  of  the  large  number  of  suc- 
cessive mountain  ranges  that  crisscross  the  peninsula.  The  tallest 
mountains  are  in  North  Korea.  The  tallest  mountain  in  South 
Korea  is  Mount  Halla  (1,950  meters),  which  is  the  cone  of  a  vol- 
canic formation  constituting  Cheju  Island.  There  are  three  major 
mountain  ranges  within  South  Korea:  the  T'aebaek  and  Sobaek 
ranges  and  the  Chiri  Massif  (see  fig.  4). 

Unlike  Japan  or  the  northern  provinces  of  China,  the  Korean 
Peninsula  is  geologically  stable.  There  are  no  active  volcanoes,  and 
there  have  been  no  strong  earthquakes.  Historical  records,  however, 
describe  volcanic  activity  on  Mount  Halla  during  the  Koryo  Dy- 
nasty (918-1392  A.D.).

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

Over  the  centuries,  Korea's  inhabitants  have  cut  down  most  of 
the  ancient  Korean  forests,  with  the  exception  of  a  few  remote, 
mountainous  areas.  The  disappearance  of  the  forests  has  been  a 
major  cause  of  soil  erosion  and  flooding.  Because  of  successful 
reforestation  programs  and  the  declining  use  of  firewood  as  a  source 
of  energy  since  the  1960s,  however,  most  of  South  Korea's  hills 
in  the  1980s  were  amply  covered  with  foliage.  South  Korea  has 
no  extensive  plains;  its  lowlands  are  the  product  of  mountain  ero- 
sion. Approximately  30  percent  of  the  area  of  South  Korea  con- 
sists of  lowlands,  with  the  rest  consisting  of  uplands  and  mountains. 
The  great  majority  of  the  lowland  area  lies  along  the  coasts,  particu- 
larly the  west  coast,  and  along  the  major  rivers.  The  most  important 
lowlands  are  the  Han  River  plain  around  Seoul,  the  P'yongt'aek 
coastal  plain  southwest  of  Seoul,  the  Kum  River  basin,  the  Nak- 
tong  River  basin,  and  the  Yongsan  and  the  Honam  plains  in  the 
southwest.  A  narrow  littoral  plain  extends  along  the  east  coast. 

The  Naktong  is  South  Korea's  longest  river  (521  kilometers). 
The  Han  River,  which  flows  through  Seoul,  is  514  kilometers  long, 
and  the  Kum  River  is  401  kilometers  long.  Other  major  rivers  in- 
clude the  Imjin,  which  flows  through  both  North  Korea  and  South 
Korea  and  forms  an  estuary  with  the  Han  River;  the  Pukhan,  a 
tributary  of  the  Han  that  also  flows  out  of  North  Korea;  and  the 
Somjin.  The  major  rivers  flow  north  to  south  or  east  to  west  and 
empty  into  the  Yellow  Sea  or  the  Korea  Strait.  They  tend  to  be 
broad  and  shallow  and  to  have  wide  seasonal  variations  in  water 
flow. 

News  that  North  Korea  was  constructing  a  huge  multipurpose 
dam  at  the  base  of  Mount  Kumgang  (1,638  meters)  north  of  the 
DMZ  caused  considerable  consternation  in  South  Korea  during 
the  mid-1980s.  South  Korean  authorities  feared  that  once  it  was 
completed,  a  sudden  release  of  the  dam's  waters  into  the  Pukhan 
River  during  north- south  hostilities  could  flood  Seoul  and  para- 
lyze the  capital  region.  During  1987  the  Kumgang-san  Dam  was 
a  major  issue  that  Seoul  sought  to  raise  in  talks  with  P'yongyang. 
Although  Seoul  completed  a  "Peace  Dam"  on  the  Pukhan  River 
to  counteract  the  potential  threat  of  Pyongyang's  dam  project 
before  the  1988  Olympics,  the  North  Korean  project  apparently 
still  was  in  its  initial  stages  of  construction  in  1990. 

Climate 

Part  of  the  East  Asian  monsoonal  region,  South  Korea  has  a  tem- 
perate climate  with  four  distinct  seasons.  The  movement  of  air  mass- 
es from  the  Asian  continent  exerts  greater  influence  on  South 
Korea's  weather  than  does  air  movement  from  the  Pacific  Ocean.

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Winters  are  usually  long,  cold,  and  dry,  whereas  summers  are  short, 
hot,  and  humid.  Spring  and  autumn  are  pleasant  but  short  in  du- 
ration. Seoul's  mean  temperature  in  January  is  -  5°C  to  -  2.5°C; 
in  July  the  mean  temperature  is  about  22.5°C  to  25°C.  Because 
of  its  southern  and  seagirt  location,  Cheju  Island  has  warmer  and 
milder  weather  than  other  parts  of  South  Korea.  Mean  tempera- 
tures on  Cheju  range  from  2.5°C  in  January  to  25°C  in  July. 

The  country  generally  has  sufficient  rainfall  to  sustain  its  agricul- 
ture. Rarely  does  less  than  75  centimeters  of  rain  fall  in  any  given 
year;  for  the  most  part,  rainfall  is  over  100  centimeters.  Amounts 
of  precipitation,  however,  can  vary  from  year  to  year.  Serious 
droughts  occur  about  once  every  eight  years,  especially  in  the  rice- 
producing  southwestern  part  of  the  country.  About  two-thirds  of 
the  annual  precipitation  occurs  between  June  and  September. 

South  Korea  is  less  vulnerable  to  typhoons  than  Japan,  Taiwan, 
the  east  coast  of  China,  or  the  Philippines.  From  one  to  three 
typhoons  can  be  expected  per  year.  Typhoons  usually  pass  over 
South  Korea  in  late  summer,  especially  in  August,  and  bring  tor- 
rential rains  (see  fig.  5).  Flooding  occasionally  causes  considera- 
ble damage.  In  September  1984,  record  floods  caused  the  deaths 
of  190  people  and  left  200,000  homeless.  This  disaster  prompted 
the  North  Korean  government  to  make  an  unprecedented  offer  of 
humanitarian  aid  in  the  form  of  rice,  medicine,  clothes,  and  building 
materials.  South  Korea  accepted  these  items  and  distributed  them 
to  flood  victims. 

Population 

Although  a  variety  of  different  Asian  peoples  had  migrated  to 
the  Korean  Peninsula  in  past  centuries,  very  few  have  remained 
permanentiy.  Hence,  by  1990  both  South  Korea  and  North  Korea 
were  among  the  world's  most  ethnically  homogeneous  nations.  The 
number  of  indigenous  minorities  was  negligible.  In  South  Korea, 
people  of  foreign  origin,  including  Westerners,  Chinese,  and 
Japanese,  were  a  small  percentage  of  the  population,  whose  resi- 
dence was  generally  temporary.  Like  their  Japanese  neighbors, 
Koreans  tend  to  equate  nationality  or  citizenship  with  member- 
ship in  a  single,  homogeneous  ethnic  group  or  "race"  (minjok,  in 
Korean).  A  common  language  and  culture  also  are  viewed  as  impor- 
tant elements  in  Korean  identity.  The  idea  of  multiracial  or  mul- 
tiethnic nations,  like  India  or  the  United  States,  strikes  many 
Koreans  as  odd  or  even  contradictory.  Consciousness  of  homogenei- 
ty is  a  major  reason  why  Koreans  on  both  sides  of  the  DMZ  viewed 
their  country's  division  as  an  unnatural  and  unnecessary  tragedy.

Against  the  background  of  ethnic  homogeneity,  however,  sig- 
nificant regional  differences  exist.  Within  South  Korea,  the  most 
important  regional  difference  is  between  the  Kyongsang  region, 
embracing  North  Kyongsang  and  South  Kyongsang  provinces  in 
the  southeast,  and  the  Cholla  region,  embracing  North  Cholla  and 
South  Cholla  provinces  in  the  southwest.  The  two  regions,  sepa- 
rated by  the  Chiri  Massif,  nurture  a  rivalry  said  to  reach  back  to 
the  Three  Kingdoms  Period,  which  lasted  from  the  fourth  century 


76 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


to  the  seventh  century  A.D.,  when  the  kingdoms  of  Paekche  and 
Silla  struggled  for  control  of  the  peninsula  (see  The  Origins  of  the 
Korean  Nation,  ch.  1;  fig.  2).  Observers  noted  that  interregional 
marriages  are  rare,  and  that  as  of  1990  a  new  four-lane  highway 
completed  in  1984  between  Kwangju  and  Taegu,  the  capitals  of 
South  Cholla  and  North  Kyongsang  provinces,  respectively,  had 
not  been  successful  in  promoting  travel  between  the  two  areas. 

South  Korea's  political  elite,  including  presidents  Park  Chung 
Hee,  Chun  Doo  Hwan,  and  Roh  Tae  Woo,  have  come  largely  from 
the  Kyongsang  region.  As  a  result,  Kyongsang  has  been  a  special 
beneficiary  of  government  development  assistance.  By  contrast, 
the  Cholla  region  has  remained  comparatively  rural,  undeveloped, 
and  poor.  Chronically  disaffected,  its  people  righdy  or  wrongly  have 
a  reputation  for  rebelliousness.  Regional  bitterness  was  intensified 
by  the  May  1980  Kwangju  incident,  in  which  about  200  and 
perhaps  many  more  inhabitants  of  the  capital  of  South  Cholla 
Province  were  killed  by  government  troops  sent  to  quell  an  insur- 
rection. Many  of  the  troops  reportedly  were  from  the  Kyongsang 
region  (see  Students  in  1980,  ch.  1;  United  States  Forces  in  South 
Korea,  ch.  5). 

Regional  stereotypes,  like  regional  dialects,  have  been  breaking 
down  under  the  influence  of  centralized  education,  nationwide  me- 
dia, and  the  several  decades  of  population  movement  since  the 
Korean  War.  Stereotypes  remain  important,  however,  in  the  eyes 
of  many  South  Koreans.  For  example,  the  people  of  Kyonggi 
Province,  surrounding  Seoul,  are  often  described  as  being  cultured, 
and  Ch'ungch'ong  people,  inhabiting  the  region  embracing  North 
Ch'ungch'ong  and  South  Ch'ungch'ong  provinces,  are  thought 
to  be  mild-mannered,  manifesting  trueyangban  virtues  (see  Tradi- 
tional Social  Structure,  this  ch.).  The  people  of  Kangwon  Province 
in  the  northeast  are  viewed  as  poor  and  stolid,  whereas  Koreans 
from  the  northern  provinces  of  P'yongan,  Hwanghae,  and  Ham- 
gyong,  now  in  North  Korea,  are  perceived  as  being  diligent  and 
aggressive.  Cheju  Island  is  famous  for  its  strong-minded  and  in- 
dependent women. 

Population  Trends 

The  population  of  South  Korea  has  grown  rapidly  since  the 
republic's  establishment  in  1948.  In  the  first  official  census,  taken 
in  1949,  the  total  population  of  South  Korea  was  calculated  at 
20,188,641  people.  The  1985  census  total  was  40,466,577.  Popu- 
lation growth  was  slow,  averaging  about  1 . 1  percent  annually  during 
the  period  from  1949  to  1955,  when  the  population  registered  at 
21.5  million.  Growth  accelerated  between  1955  and  1966  to  29.2 


77 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

million  or  an  annual  average  of  2.8  percent,  but  declined  signifi- 
cantly during  the  period  1966  to  1985  to  an  annual  average  of  1.7 
percent  (see  fig.  6).  Thereafter,  the  annual  average  growth  rate 
was  estimated  to  be  less  than  1  percent,  similar  to  the  low  growth 
rates  of  most  industrialized  countries  and  to  the  target  figure  set 
by  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Social  Affairs  for  the  1990s.  As  of 
January  1,  1989,  the  population  of  South  Korea  was  estimated  to 
be  approximately  42.2  million. 

The  proportion  of  the  total  population  under  fifteen  years  of  age 
has  risen  and  fallen  with  the  growth  rate.  In  1955  approximately 
41.2  percent  of  the  population  was  under  fifteen  years  of  age,  a 
percentage  that  rose  to  43.5  percent  in  1966  before  falling  to  38.3 
percent  in  1975,  34.2  percent  in  1980,  and  29.9  percent  in  1985. 
In  the  past,  the  large  proportion  of  children  relative  to  the  total 
population  put  great  strains  on  the  country's  economy,  particu- 
larly because  substantial  resources  were  invested  in  education  fa- 
cilities (see  Primary  and  Secondary  Schools,  this  ch.).  With  the 
slowdown  in  the  population  growth  rate  and  a  rise  in  the  median 
age  (from  18.7  years  to  21.8  years  between  1960  and  1980),  the 
age  structure  of  the  population  has  begun  to  resemble  the  colum- 
nar pattern  typical  of  developed  countries,  rather  than  the  pyra- 
midal pattern  found  in  most  parts  of  the  Third  World. 

The  decline  in  the  population  growth  rate  and  in  the  proportion 
of  people  under  fifteen  years  of  age  after  1966  reflected  the  success 
of  official  and  unofficial  birth  control  programs.  The  government 
of  President  Syngman  Rhee  (1948-60)  was  conservative  in  such 
matters.  Although  Christian  churches  initiated  a  family  planning 
campaign  in  1957,  it  was  not  until  1962  that  the  government  of 
Park  Chung  Hee,  alarmed  at  the  way  in  which  the  rapidly  increas- 
ing population  was  undermining  economic  growth,  began  a  nation- 
wide family  planning  program.  Other  factors  that  contributed  to 
a  slowdown  in  population  growth  included  urbanization,  later  mar- 
riage ages  for  both  men  and  women,  higher  education  levels,  a 
greater  number  of  women  in  the  labor  force,  and  better  health  stan- 
dards (see  Public  Health  and  Welfare,  this  ch.). 

Public  and  private  agencies  involved  in  family  planning  included 
the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Social  Affairs,  the  Ministry  of  Home 
Affairs,  the  Planned  Parenthood  Federation  of  Korea,  and  the 
Korea  Institute  of  Family  Planning.  In  the  late  1980s,  their  activi- 
ties included  distribution  of  free  birth  control  devices  and  infor- 
mation, classes  for  women  on  family  planning  methods,  and  the 
granting  of  special  subsidies  and  privileges  (such  as  low-interest 
housing  loans)  to  parents  who  agreed  to  undergo  sterilization.  There 


78 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 

were  502,000  South  Koreans  sterilized  in  1984,  as  compared  with 
426,000  in  the  previous  year. 

The  1973  Maternal  and  Child  Health  Law  legalized  abortion. 
In  1983  the  government  began  suspending  medical  insurance 
benefits  for  maternal  care  for  pregnant  women  with  three  or  more 
children.  It  also  denied  tax  deductions  for  education  expenses  to 
parents  with  two  or  more  children. 

As  in  China,  cultural  attitudes  pose  problems  for  family  plan- 
ning programs.  A  strong  preference  for  sons — who  in  Korea's  Con- 
fucian value  system  are  expected  to  care  for  their  parents  in  old 
age  and  carry  on  the  family  name — means  that  parents  with  only 
daughters  usually  continue  to  have  children  until  a  son  is  born. 
The  government  has  encouraged  married  couples  to  have  only  one 
child.  Such  encouragement  has  been  a  prominent  theme  in  public 
service  advertising,  which  stresses  "have  a  single  child  and  raise 
it  well." 

Total  fertility  rates  (the  average  number  of  births  a  woman  will 
have  during  her  lifetime)  fell  from  6.1  births  per  female  in  1960 
to  4.2  in  1970,  2.8  in  1980,  and  2.4  in  1984.  The  number  of  live 
births,  recorded  as  711,810  in  1978,  grew  to  a  high  of  917,860  in 
1982.  This  development  stirred  apprehensions  among  family  plan- 
ning experts  of  a  new  "baby  boom."  By  1986,  however,  the  number 
of  live  births  had  declined  to  806,041. 

Given  the  size  and  age  structure  of  the  population  in  1990, 
however,  substantial  increases  are  expected  over  the  next  few  de- 
cades. According  to  the  government's  Economic  Planning  Board, 
the  country's  population  will  increase  to  between  46  and  48  mil- 
lion by  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century,  with  growth  rates  rang- 
ing between  0.9  and  1.2  percent.  The  population  is  expected  to 
stabilize  (that  is,  cease  to  grow)  in  the  year  2023  at  around  52.6 
million  people.  In  the  words  of  Asiaweek  magazine,  the  "stabilized 
tally  will  approximate  the  number  of  Filipinos  in  1983,  but  squeezed 
into  less  than  a  third  of  their  [the  Philippines']  space." 

Population  Settlement  Patterns 

South  Korea  was  one  of  the  world's  most  densely  populated  coun- 
tries, with  an  estimated  425  people  per  square  kilometer  in 
1989 — over  sixteen  times  the  average  population  density  of  the  Unit- 
ed States  in  the  late  1980s.  By  comparison,  China  had  an  estimat- 
ed 1 14  people,  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West  Germany) 
246  people,  and  Japan  323  people  per  square  kilometer  in  the  late 
1980s.  Because  about  70  percent  of  South  Korea's  land  area  is 
mountainous  and  the  population  is  concentrated  in  the  lowland 
areas,  actual  population  densities  were  in  general  greater  than  the 


79 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


80 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


average.  As  early  as  1975,  it  was  estimated  that  the  density  of  South 
Korea's  thirty-five  cities,  each  of  which  had  a  population  of  50,000 
or  more  inhabitants,  was  3,700  people  per  square  kilometer.  Be- 
cause of  continued  migration  to  urban  areas,  the  figure  was  doubt- 
less higher  in  the  late  1980s. 

In  1988  Seoul  had  a  population  density  of  17,030  people  per 
square  kilometer  as  compared  with  13,816  people  per  square  kilo- 
meter in  1980.  The  second  largest  city,  Pusan,  had  a  density  of 
8,504  people  per  square  kilometer  in  1988  as  compared  with  7,272 
people  in  1980.  Kyonggi  Province,  which  surrounds  the  capital  and 
contains  Inch'on,  the  country's  fourth  largest  city,  was  the  most 
densely  populated  province;  Kangwon  Province  in  the  northeast 
was  the  least  densely  populated  province. 

The  extreme  crowding  in  South  Korea  in  1990  was  a  major  fac- 
tor not  only  in  economic  development  and  in  the  standard  of  liv- 
ing but  also  in  the  development  of  social  attitudes  and  human 
relationships.  More  than  most  other  peoples,  South  Koreans  have 
had  to  learn  to  live  peacefully  with  each  other  in  small,  crowded 
spaces,  in  which  the  competition  for  limited  resources,  including 
space  itself,  is  intense.  Continued  population  growth  means  that 
the  shortage  of  space  for  living  and  working  will  grow  more  se- 
vere. According  to  the  government's  Economic  Planning  Board, 
the  population  density  will  be  530  people  per  square  kilometer  by 
2023,  the  year  the  population  is  expected  to  stabilize. 

Urbanization 

Like  other  newly  industrializing  economies,  South  Korea  ex- 
perienced rapid  growth  of  urban  areas  caused  by  the  migration  of 
large  numbers  of  people  from  the  countryside.  In  the  eighteenth 
and  nineteenth  centuries,  Seoul,  by  far  the  largest  urban  settle- 
ment, had  a  population  of  about  190,000  people.  There  was  a  strik- 
ing contrast  with  Japan,  where  Edo  (Tokyo)  had  as  many  as  1 
million  inhabitants  and  the  urban  population  comprised  as  much 
as  10  to  15  percent  of  the  total  during  the  Tokugawa  Period 
(1600-1868).  During  the  closing  years  of  the  Choson  Dynasty  and 
the  first  years  of  Japanese  colonial  rule,  the  urban  population  of 
Korea  was  no  more  than  3  percent  of  the  total.  After  1930,  when 
the  Japanese  began  industrial  development  on  the  Korean  Penin- 
sula, particularly  in  the  northern  provinces  adjacent  to  Manchuria, 
the  urban  portion  of  the  population  began  to  grow,  reaching  11.6 
percent  for  all  of  Korea  in  1940. 

Between  1945  and  1985,  the  urban  population  of  South  Korea 
grew  from  14.5  percent  to  65.4  percent  of  the  total  population  (see 
fig.  7).  In  1988  the  Economic  Planning  Board  estimated  that  the

urban  portion  of  the  population  will  reach  78 . 3  percent  by  the  end 
of  the  twentieth  century.  Most  of  this  urban  increase  was  attributa- 
ble to  migration  rather  than  to  natural  growth  of  the  urban  popu- 
lation. Urban  birth  rates  have  generally  been  lower  than  the  national 
average.  The  extent  of  urbanization  in  South  Korea,  however,  is 
not  fully  revealed  in  these  statistics.  Urban  population  was  defined 
in  the  national  census  as  being  restricted  to  those  municipalities 
with  50,000  or  more  inhabitants.  Although  many  settlements  with 
fewer  than  50,000  inhabitants  were  satellite  towns  of  Seoul  or  other 
large  cities  or  mining  communities  in  northeastern  Kangwon 
Province,  which  would  be  considered  urban  in  terms  of  the  living 
conditions  and  occupations  of  the  inhabitants,  they  still  were  offi- 
cially classified  as  rural. 

The  dislocation  caused  by  the  Korean  War  accounted  for  the 
rapid  increase  in  urban  population  during  the  early  1950s. 
Hundreds  of  thousands  of  refugees,  many  of  them  from  North 
Korea,  streamed  into  the  cities.  During  the  post-Korean  War  period, 
rural  people  left  their  ancestral  villages  in  search  of  greater  economic 
and  educational  opportunities  in  the  cities.  By  the  late  1960s,  migra- 
tion had  become  a  serious  problem,  not  only  because  cities  were 
terribly  overcrowded,  but  also  because  the  rural  areas  were  losing 
the  most  youthful  and  productive  members  of  their  labor  force. 

In  the  early  1970s,  the  Park  Chung  Hee  government  launched 
the  Saemaul  undong  (New  Community  Movement)  as  a  rural 
reconstruction  and  self-help  movement  to  improve  economic  con- 
ditions in  the  villages,  close  the  wide  gap  in  income  between  rural 
and  urban  areas,  and  stem  urban  migration — as  well  as  to  build 
a  political  base.  Despite  a  huge  amount  of  government- sponsored 
publicity,  especially  during  the  Park  era,  it  was  not  clear  by  the 
late  1980s  that  the  Saemaul  undong  had  achieved  its  objectives. 
By  that  time  many,  if  not  most,  farming  and  fishing  villages  con- 
sisted of  older  persons;  relatively  few  able-bodied  men  and  women 
remained  to  work  in  the  fields  or  to  fish.  This  trend  was  apparent 
in  government  statistics  for  the  1986-87  period:  the  proportion  of 
people  fifty  years  old  or  older  living  in  farming  communities  grew 
from  28.7  percent  in  1986  to  30.6  percent  in  1987,  whereas  the 
number  of  people  in  their  twenties  living  in  farming  communities 
declined  from  11.3  percent  to  10.8  percent.  The  nationwide  per- 
centages for  people  fifty  years  old  or  older  and  in  their  twenties 
were,  in  1986,  14.9  percent  and  20.2  percent,  respectively  (see 
Agriculture,  ch.  3). 

In  1985  the  largest  cities  were  Seoul  (9,645,932  inhabitants),  Pusan 
(3,516,807),  Taegu  (2,030,672),  Inch'on  (1,387,491),  Kwangju 
(906,129),  and  Taejon  (866,695).  According  to  government  statistics, 


84 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


the  population  of  Seoul,  one  of  the  world's  largest  cities,  surpassed 
10  million  people  in  late  1988.  Seoul's  average  annual  population 
growth  rate  during  the  late  1980s  was  more  than  3  percent.  Two- 
thirds  of  this  growth  was  attributable  to  migration  rather  than  to 
natural  increase.  Surveys  revealed  that  "new  employment  or  seek- 
ing a  new  job,"  "job  transfer,"  and  "business"  were  major  rea- 
sons given  by  new  immigrants  for  coming  to  the  capital.  Other 
factors  cited  by  immigrants  included  "education"  and  "a  more 
convenient  area  to  live."  To  alleviate  overcrowding  in  Seoul's 
downtown  area,  the  city  government  drew  up  a  master  plan  in  the 
mid-1980s  that  envisioned  the  development  of  four  "core  zones" 
by  2000:  the  original  downtown  area,  Yongdungp'o-Yoido,  Yong- 
dong,  and  Ch'amsil.  Satellite  towns  also  would  be  established  or 
expanded.  In  the  late  1980s,  statistics  revealed  that  the  daytime 
or  commuter  population  of  downtown  Seoul  was  as  much  as  six 
times  the  officially  registered  population.  If  the  master  plan  is  suc- 
cessful, many  commuters  will  travel  to  work  in  a  core  area  nearer 
their  homes,  and  the  downtown  area's  daytime  population  will 
decrease.  Many  government  ministries  have  been  moved  out  of 
Seoul,  and  the  army,  navy,  and  air  force  headquarters  have  been 
relocated  to  Taejon. 

In  1985  the  population  of  Seoul  constituted  23.8  percent  of  the 
national  total.  Provincial  cities,  however,  experienced  equal  and, 
in  many  cases,  greater  expansion  than  the  capital.  Growth  was  par- 
ticularly spectacular  in  the  southeastern  coastal  region,  which  en- 
compasses the  port  cities  of  Pusan,  Masan,  Yosu,  Chinhae,  Ulsan, 
and  P'ohang.  Census  figures  show  that  Ulsan 's  population  increased 
eighteenfold,  growing  from  30,000  to  551,300  inhabitants  between 
1960  and  1985.  With  the  exception  of  Yosu,  all  of  these  cities  are 
in  South  Kyongsang  Province,  a  region  that  has  been  an  especial- 
ly favored  recipient  of  government  development  projects.  By  com- 
parison, the  population  of  Kwangju,  capital  of  South  Cholla 
Province,  increased  less  than  threefold  between  1960  and  1985, 
growing  from  315,000  to  906,129  inhabitants. 

Rapid  urban  growth  has  brought  familiar  problems  to  developed 
and  developing  countries  alike.  The  construction  of  large  numbers 
of  high-rise  apartment  complexes  in  Seoul  and  other  large  cities 
alleviated  housing  shortages  to  some  extent.  But  it  also  imposed 
hardship  on  the  tens  of  thousands  of  people  who  were  obliged  to 
relocate  from  their  old  neighborhoods  because  they  could  not  af- 
ford the  rents  in  the  new  buildings.  In  the  late  1980s,  squatter  areas 
consisting  of  one-story  shacks  still  existed  in  some  parts  of  Seoul. 
Housing  for  all  but  the  wealthiest  was  generally  cramped.  The  con- 
centration of  factories  in  urban  areas,  the  rapid  growth  of  motorized 


85 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


traffic,  and  the  widespread  use  of  coal  for  heating  during  the  severe 
winter  months  have  caused  dangerous  levels  of  air  and  water  pol- 
lution. Although  environmental  awareness  is  increasing,  a  polluted 
environment  will  adversely  affect  the  quality  of  life  in  the  cities  for 
some  time  to  come. 

Koreans  Living  Overseas 

Large-scale  emigration  from  Korea  began  around  1904  and  con- 
tinued until  the  end  of  World  War  II.  During  the  Japanese  colonial 
occupation,  many  Koreans  emigrated  to  Manchuria  (present-day 
China's  northeastern  provinces  of  Liaoning,  Jilin,  and  Heilong- 
jiang),  other  parts  of  China,  the  Soviet  Union,  Hawaii,  and  the 
continental  United  States.  Most  emigrated  for  economic  reasons; 
employment  opportunities  were  scarce,  and  many  Korean  farm- 
ers lost  their  land  after  the  Japanese  introduced  a  system  of  land 
registration  and  private  land  tenure,  imposed  higher  land  taxes, 
and  promoted  the  growth  of  an  absentee  landlord  class  charging 
exorbitant  rents.  Koreans  from  the  northern  provinces  of  Korea 
went  mainly  to  Manchuria,  China,  and  Siberia.  Many  people  from 
the  southern  provinces  went  to  Japan.  Koreans  were  conscripted 
into  Japanese  labor  battalions  or  the  Japanese  army,  especially  dur- 
ing World  War  II.  In  the  1940-44  period,  nearly  2  million  Koreans 
lived  in  Japan,  1.4  million  in  Manchuria,  600,000  in  Siberia,  and 
130,000  in  China.  An  estimated  40,000  Koreans  were  scattered 
among  other  countries.  At  the  end  of  World  War  II,  approximately 
2  million  Koreans  were  repatriated  from  Japan  and  Manchuria. 

More  than  4  million  ethnic  Koreans  lived  outside  the  peninsula 
during  the  early  1980s.  The  largest  group,  about  1.7  million  peo- 
ple, lived  in  China.  Most  had  assumed  Chinese  citizenship.  The 
Soviet  Union  had  about  430,000  ethnic  Koreans.  One  observer 
noted  that  Koreans  had  been  so  successful  in  running  collective 
farms  in  Soviet  Central  Asia  that  being  Korean  was  often  associated 
by  other  Soviets  with  being  rich. 

By  contrast,  many  of  Japan's  approximately  700,000  Koreans 
had  below-average  standards  of  living.  This  situation  occurred  part- 
ly because  of  discrimination  by  the  Japanese  majority  and  partly 
because  of  the  fact  that  a  large  number  of  resident  Koreans,  loyal 
to  the  North  Korean  regime  of  Kim  II  Sung,  preferred  to  remain 
separate  from  and  hostile  to  the  Japanese  mainstream.  The  pro- 
North  Korea  Chosen  soren  (General  Association  of  Korean  Resi- 
dents in  Japan)  initially  was  more  successful  than  the  pro-South 
Korea  Mindan  (Association  for  Korean  Residents  in  Japan)  in  at- 
tracting adherents  among  residents  in  Japan.  Since  diplomatic  re- 
lations were  established  between  Seoul  and  Tokyo  in  1965,  however,

the  South  Korean  government  has  taken  an  active  role  in  promot- 
ing the  interests  of  their  residents  in  Japan  in  negotiations  with 
the  Japanese  government  (see  Relations  with  Japan,  ch.  4).  It  also 
has  provided  subsidies  to  Korean  schools  in  Japan  and  other  com- 
munity activities. 

By  the  end  of  1988,  there  were  over  2  million  South  Korean  over- 
seas residents.  North  America  was  the  preferred  destination — the 
choice  of  over  1.2  million  of  these  residents.  Korean  immigrants 
in  the  United  States  and  Canada  gained  a  reputation  for  hard  work 
and  economic  success.  South  Koreans  also  were  overseas  residents 
of  Japan  (at  least  680,000),  Central  America  and  South  America 
(85,000),  the  Middle  East  (62,000),  Western  Europe  (40,000),  other 
Asian  countries  (27,000),  and  Africa  (25,000).  A  limited  number 
of  South  Korean  government- sponsored  migrants  setded  in  Chile, 
Argentina,  and  other  Latin  American  countries.  Because  of  South 
Korea's  rapid  economic  expansion,  an  increasing  number  of  its 
citizens  resided  abroad  on  a  temporary  basis  as  business  execu- 
tives, technical  personnel,  foreign  students,  and  construction  work- 
ers. A  small  number  of  overseas  South  Koreans  had  migrated  back 
to  South  Korea,  primarily  because  of  the  much  improved  economic 
conditions  and  the  difficulties  in  adjusting  to  living  abroad. 

Social  Structure  and  Values 

The  social  values  of  contemporary  South  Korea  reflect  the  syn- 
thesis and  development  of  diverse  influences,  both  indigenous  and 
foreign.  Probably  the  most  important  of  these  is  the  neo-Confucian 
doctrine  of  the  Chinese  philosopher  Zhu  Xi  (1130-1200),  first  in- 
troduced into  Korea  during  the  closing  years  of  the  Koryo  Dynasty 
(918-1392).  The  rulers  of  the  Choson  Dynasty  (1392-1910)  adopted 
it  as  their  state  ideology.  The  most  important  Korean  neo- 
Confucian  philosopher,  Yi  Hwang,  also  known  as  Yi  T'oe-gye 
(1501-70),  had  a  great  influence  on  later  generations  of  Confu- 
cianists  not  only  in  Korea  but  also  in  Japan. 

Neo-Confucianism  combines  the  social  ethics  of  the  classical 
Chinese  philosophers  Confucius  (Kong  Zi,  551-479  B.C.)  and 
Mencius  (Meng  Zi,  372-289  B.C.)  with  Taoist,  or  Daoist,  and 
Buddhist  metaphysics.  One  of  the  doctrine's  basic  ideas  is  that  the 
institutions  and  practices  of  the  ideal  human  community  are  an 
expression  of  the  immutable  principles  or  laws  that  govern  the  move- 
ments of  the  cosmos.  Through  correct  social  practice,  as  defined 
by  the  Confucian  sages  and  their  commentators,  individuals  can 
achieve  a  kind  of  spiritual  unity  with  heaven.  Neo-Confucianism 
defines  formal  social  relations  on  all  levels  of  society.  Social  relations 
are  not  conceived  of  in  terms  of  the  happiness  or  satisfaction  of 


88 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


the  individuals  involved,  but  in  terms  of  the  harmonious  integra- 
tion of  individuals  into  a  collective  whole  that  mirrors  the  harmo- 
ny of  the  natural  order. 

Neo-Confucianism  in  Korea  was  becoming  rigid  and  increasingly 
conservative  by  the  mid-1 500s.  The  practice  of  neo-Confucianism 
emphasized  hierarchy  in  human  relations  and  self-control  on  the 
individual  level.  Society  was  defined  in  terms  of  the  Five  Relation- 
ships (o  ryun  in  Korean;  w u  lun  in  Chinese)  that  had  been  formulated 
by  classical  Chinese  thinkers,  such  as  Mencius,  and  subsequently 
sanctified  by  the  neo-Confucian  metaphysicians:  "between  father 
and  son  there  should  be  affection;  between  ruler  and  minister  there 
should  be  righteousness;  between  husband  and  wife  there  should 
be  attention  to  their  separate  functions;  between  old  and  young 
there  should  be  a  proper  order;  and  between  friends  there  should 
be  faithfulness."  Only  the  last  was  a  relationship  between  equals. 
The  others  were  based  on  authority  and  subordination,  including 
the  first  relationship,  which  involved  not  so  much  mutual  love  as 
the  unquestioning  subordination  of  the  son  to  the  will  of  his  father. 

Throughout  traditional  Korean  society,  from  the  royal  palace 
and  central  government  offices  in  Seoul  to  the  humblest  household 
in  the  provinces,  the  themes  of  hierarchy  and  inequality  were  per- 
vasive. Persons  were  expected  to  nurture  "sincere"  attitudes,  which 
meant  not  so  much  expressing  what  one  "really"  felt  as  "reflect- 
ing on"  or  "clarifying"  one's  thoughts  and  feelings  until  they  con- 
formed to  traditional  norms.  There  was  no  concept  of  the  rights 
of  the  individual.  The  ideal  man  or  woman  was  one  who  controlled 
his  or  her  passions  or  emotions  in  order  to  fulfill  to  the  letter  a  host 
of  exacting  social  obligations. 

In  the  context  of  wider  society,  a  well-defined  elite  of  scholar- 
officials  versed  in  neo-Confucian  orthodoxy  was  legitimized  in  terms 
of  the  traditional  ethical  distinction  between  the  educated  "superior 
man"  or  "gentieman"  and  the  "small  man"  who  seeks  only  profit. 
The  distinction  was  a  central  theme  in  the  writings  of  Confucius 
and  Mencius.  Confucianism  as  a  political  theory  proposed  a  benevo- 
lent paternalism:  the  masses  had  no  role  in  government,  but  the 
scholar-officials  were  supposed  to  look  after  them  as  fathers  look 
after  their  children. 

Just  as  the  father  commanded  unquestioning  obedience  in  the 
household  and  the  scholar-official  elite  did  so  in  the  nation  as  a 
whole,  there  was  also  a  hierarchy  in  international  relations.  China, 
the  homeland  of  neo-Confucianism  and  the  most  powerful  nation 
in  the  region,  was  the  center  of  Choson  Korea's  cultural  universe 
for  most  of  the  dynasty's  duration. 

Foreign  observers  have  been  impressed  with  the  diversity  of  the 


89 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

Korean  character  as  expressed  in  day-to-day  human  relations. 
There  is,  on  one  hand,  the  image  of  Koreans  as  self- controlled, 
deferential,  and  meticulous  in  the  fulfillment  of  their  social  obli- 
gations; on  the  other  hand,  there  is  the  Korean  reputation  for  vola- 
tility and  emotionalism,  for  being  the  "Irish  of  the  East."  The 
ecstasy  and  euphoria  of  shamanistic  religious  practices,  one  of 
Korea's  most  characteristic  cultural  expressions,  contrasts  sharply 
with  the  austere  self-control  of  Confucian  ancestor  rituals  (see 
Religion,  this  ch.). 

Although  relatively  minor  themes  in  the  history  of  Korean  ethics 
and  social  thought,  the  concepts  of  equality  and  respect  for  individu- 
als are  not  entirely  lacking.  The  doctrines  of  Ch'ondogyo  (see  Glos- 
sary), an  indigenous  religion  that  originated  in  the  nineteenth 
century  and  combines  elements  of  Buddhism,  Taoism,  shaman- 
ism, Confucianism,  and  Catholicism,  teach  that  every  human 
"bears  divinity"  and  that  one  must  "treat  man  as  god." 

Western  social  and  political  values  such  as  democracy,  individua- 
lism, the  equality  of  the  sexes  (also  seen  in  Ch'ondogyo),  and  na- 
tional self-determination  were  introduced  by  late  nineteenth-century 
Korean  reformers  and  by  West  European  and  North  American  mis- 
sionaries, who  had  a  profound  effect  upon  the  development  of  Korean 
education  and  political  values.  These  concepts  have  played  an  in- 
creasingly prominent  role  in  South  Korean  life  in  recent  decades. 

Although  by  no  means  democratic,  the  Confucian  tradition  it- 
self contains  anti- authoritarian  themes.  Mencius  taught  that  the 
sovereign  and  his  officials  must  concern  themselves  with  the  wel- 
fare of  the  people  and  that  a  king  who  misuses  his  power  loses  the 
right  to  rule — the  doctrine  of  the  Mandate  of  Heaven.  In  Korean 
as  well  as  Chinese  history,  there  were  many  Confucian  statesmen 
who,  often  at  the  cost  of  their  own  lives,  opposed  the  misuse  of 
power  by  those  in  authority.  The  tradition  of  political  protest  in 
South  Korea,  particularly  by  university  students,  owes  as  much 
to  this  aspect  of  the  Confucian  tradition  as  it  does  to  democratic 
and  Marxist  concepts  imported  from  the  West.  Just  as  out-of-power 
"rustic  literati,"  or  sarim,  pursued  purely  moral  and  academic 
studies  and  disdained  government  service  at  various  times  during 
the  Choson  period,  so  modern-day  university  students,  claiming 
to  be  the  "conscience  of  the  nation, ' '  have  opposed  the  bureaucratic 
and  professional  elite  in  government  and  private  business. 

Thus,  to  depict  traditional  Korean  social  values  in  terms  of  an 
authoritarian  Confucian  tradition  is  overly  simplistic.  A  more  com- 
prehensive account  of  social  values  might  describe  them  in  terms 
of  interacting  dualities,  a  kind  of  yin-yang  opposition  and  synthe- 
sis. There  is  the  tension,  for  example,  between  self-control  and 


90 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


solemnity,  on  the  one  hand,  and  almost  explosive  volatility  at  the 
level  of  individual  behavior,  on  the  other;  between  the  duty-bound 
austerity  of  Confucian  family  life  and  ritualism,  and  the  ecstasy 
and  abandon  of  shamanistic  rites;  between  the  conservatism  of 
agricultural  villages  and  the  looser  social  organization  of  fishing 
communities;  between  the  orthodox  concept  of  male  supremacy 
and  the  reality  of  much  "hidden"  female  power;  between  the 
"higher"  rationalized,  humanistic,  or  scientific  culture  imported 
from  China,  Japan,  or  the  West,  and  much  older  indigenous  or 
native  cultural  themes;  between  hierarchy  and  equality;  and  be- 
tween slavish  deference  to  authority  and  principled  resistance. 

Traditional  Social  Structure 

In  Choson  Dynasty  Korea,  four  rather  distinct  social  strata  de- 
veloped: the  scholar-officials,  collectively  referred  to  as  the  yang- 
ban;  the  chungin  (literally  "middle  people"),  technicians  and  ad- 
ministrators subordinate  to  theyangban;  the  sangmin,  or  commoners, 
a  large  group  composed  of  farmers,  craftsmen,  and  merchants;  and 
the  ch'ommin  (despised  people),"  at  the  bottom  of  society.  To  en- 
sure stability,  the  government  devised  a  system  of  personal  tallies 
in  order  to  identify  people  according  to  their  status. 

In  the  strictest  sense  of  the  term,  yangban  referred  to  government 
officials  or  officeholders  who  had  passed  the  civil  service  examina- 
tions that  tested  knowledge  of  the  Confucian  classics  and  their  neo- 
Confucian  interpreters.  They  were  the  Korean  counterparts  of  the 
scholar-officials,  or  mandarins,  of  imperial  China.  The  termyang- 
ban,  first  used  during  the  Koryo  Dynasty,  means  literally  "two 
groups,"  that  is,  civil  and  military  officials.  Over  the  centuries, 
however,  its  usage  became  rather  vague,  so  that  the  term  can  be 
said  to  have  several  overlapping  meanings.  Strictly  speaking,  ayang- 
ban  lineage  was  one  that  consistently  combined  examination  suc- 
cess with  appointments  to  government  office  over  a  period  of  some 
generations.  During  the  Choson  period,  examination  candidates 
had  to  show  several  generations  of  such  ancestry  on  both  sides  to 
be  admitted  to  the  civil  service  examinations.  A  broader  use  of  the 
term  included  within  the  yangban  two  other  groups  that  could  be 
considered  associated  with,  but  outside  of,  the  ruling  elite.  The 
first  group  included  those  scholars  who  had  passed  the  preliminary 
civil  service  examination  and  sometimes  the  higher  examinations 
but  had  failed  to  secure  government  appointment.  In  the  late  Cho- 
son Dynasty,  there  were  many  more  successful  examination  candi- 
dates than  there  were  positions.  The  second  group  included  the 
more  remote  relatives  and  descendants  of  government  officials. 
Even  if  these  people  were  poor  and  did  not  themselves  serve  in  the 


91 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

government,  they  were  considered  members  of  a  "yangban  family" 
and  thus  shared  the  aura  of  the  elite  as  long  as  they  retained  Con- 
fucian culture  and  rituals. 

An  interesting  development  in  the  social  history  of  the  Choson 
Dynasty  occurred  after  the  government  began  to  sell  honorary 
patents  of  office  to  people  who  were  not  yangban  to  raise  revenue 
following  the  dislocations  of  the  Hideyoshi  invasions.  Wealthy  com- 
moners sometimes  went  beyond  such  status  symbols  to  commis- 
sion forged  genealogies  or  to  take  on  other  trappings  of  yangban 
status.  This  form  of  social  climbing  was  highly  irritating  to  tradi- 
tional yangban  families  of  the  types  mentioned  above.  Probably  even 
more  common  were  former  yangban  families  that  had  drifted  down 
into  genteel  poverty  and  commoner  status.  Both  developments  show 
that  the  Choson  Dynasty  class  system  was  beginning  to  lose  some 
of  its  rigidity  on  the  eve  of  the  momentous  changes  of  the  late 
nineteenth  century. 

Yangban  serving  as  officials  could  enrich  themselves  because  they 
were  given  royal  grants  of  land  and  had  many  opportunities  for 
graft;  but  unemployed  scholars  and  local  gentry  often  were  poor. 
They  were  a  kind  of  "twilight  elite"  that  was  both  feared  and  yet 
often  mocked  in  peasant  entertainments.  In  his  satirical  Tale  of  a 
Yangban,  the  writer  Pak  Chi-won  (1737-1805)  describes  the  life  of 
a  yangban,  however  poor,  as  one  of  enforced  idleness,  exacerbated 
by  the  need  to  maintain  appearances.  A  yangban  had  to  study  Con- 
fucian literature  and  pass  at  least  the  preliminary  examinations. 
He  was  prohibited  from  engaging  in  manual  labor  or  commerce 
and  had  to  present  an  image  of  poise  and  self-control.  A  yangban 
could  not,  among  other  things,  "poke  and  play  with  his  chopsticks," 
"eat  raw  onions, ' '  or  "puff  hard  on  his  pipe,  pulling  in  his  cheeks. ' ' 
Yet  he  exercised  much  arbitrary  power  in  his  own  village.  In  prin- 
ciple, the  yangban  were  a  meritocratic  elite.  They  gained  their  po- 
sitions through  educational  achievement.  Certain  groups  of  persons 
(artisans,  merchants,  shamans,  slaves,  Buddhist  monks,  and  others) 
were  prohibited  from  taking  the  higher  civil  service  examinations, 
but  these  formed  only  a  small  minority  of  the  population.  In  the- 
ory, the  examinations  were  open  to  the  large  majority  of  people 
who  were  farmers.  In  the  early  years  of  the  Choson  Dynasty,  some 
commoners  may  have  been  able  to  attain  high  positions  by  pass- 
ing the  examinations  and  advancing  on  sheer  talent.  In  later  years, 
talent  was  a  necessary  but  not  sufficient  prerequisite  for  entry  into 
the  core  elite  because  of  the  surplus  of  successful  examinees.  In- 
fluential family  connections  were  virtually  indispensable  for  ob- 
taining high  official  positions.  Moreover,  special  posts  called 
"protection  appointments"  were  inherited  by  descendants  of  the 


92 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Choson  royal  family  and  certain  high  officials.  Despite  the  emphasis 
on  educational  merit,  the  yangban  became  in  a  very  real  sense  a 
hereditary  elite. 

Below  theyangban  yet  superior  to  the  commoners  were  the  chung- 
in,  a  small  group  of  technical  and  administrative  officials.  They 
included  astronomers,  physicians,  interpreters,  and  professional 
military  officers,  as  well  as  artists.  Local  functionaries,  who  were 
members  of  a  lower  hereditary  class,  were  an  important  and  fre- 
quentiy  oppressive  link  between  theyangban  and  the  common  people. 
They  were  often  the  de  facto  rulers  of  a  local  region. 

The  commoners,  or  sangmin,  composed  about  75  percent  of  the 
total  population.  These  farmers,  craftsmen,  and  merchants  alone 
bore  the  burden  of  taxation  and  were  subject  to  military  conscrip- 
tion. Farmers  had  higher  prestige  than  merchants,  but  lived  a  hard 
life.  Below  the  commoners,  the  ''base  people,"  or  ch'dmmin,  did 
what  was  considered  vile  or  low-prestige  work.  They  included  ser- 
vants and  slaves  in  government  offices  and  resthouses,  jailkeepers 
and  convicts,  shamans,  actors,  female  entertainers  (kisaeng),  profes- 
sional mourners,  shoemakers,  executioners,  and,  for  a  time  at  least, 
Buddhist  monks  and  nuns.  Also  included  in  this  category  were  the 
paekchong,  apparentiy  descended  from  Inner  Asian  nomads,  who 
dealt  with  meat  and  the  hides  of  animals,  were  considered  "un- 
clean," and  lived  in  segregated  communities.  Slaves  were  treated 
as  chattels  but  could  own  property  and  even  other  slaves.  Although 
numerous  at  the  beginning  of  the  Choson  Dynasty,  their  numbers 
had  dwindled  by  the  time  slavery  was  officially  abolished  at  the 
end  of  the  nineteenth  century. 

During  their  invasions  in  1592  and  1597,  the  armies  of  the 
Japanese  warlord  Toyotomi  Hideyoshi  destroyed  many  genealogical 
records,  making  it  difficult  to  determine  who  was  and  who  was  not  a 
member  of  &  yangban  family.  Also,  as  Japanese  armies  were  approach- 
ing Seoul,  slaves  in  the  capital  rose  up  and  burned  documentary 
evidence  of  their  servitude.  By  the  late  eighteenth  and  nineteenth 
centuries,  the  old  social  distinctions  were  breaking  down.  During 
the  early  Choson  Dynasty,  commoners  did  not  have  family  names 
or  class  affiliations  (see  Traditional  Family  Life,  this  ch.).  However, 
they  began  to  adopt  names  in  order  to  avoid  the  stigma  of  low  sta- 
tus. Counterfeit  genealogies  could  frequendy  be  purchased,  and 
commoners  sometimes  attached  their  names  to yangban  genealogies 
to  avoid  military  service  taxes.  Other  late  Choson  Dynasty  social 
changes  included  the  gradual  shift  of  agricultural  labor  from  slave 
status  to  contractual  arrangements  and  the  emergence  of  "en- 
trepreneurial farmers" — commoners  who  earned  small  surpluses 
through  innovative  agricultural  techniques.

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

The  Emergence  of  a  Modern  Society 

In  1894  a  program  of  social  reforms,  known  as  the  Kabo  Re- 
forms, was  initiated  by  pro-Japanese  Korean  officials.  Yangban  and 
commoners  were  made  equal  before  the  law,  the  old  Confucian 
civil  service  examinations  were  abolished,  and  slavery  and  ch'dm- 
min  status  was  ended.  Modern  forms  of  government  and  adminis- 
tration, largely  borrowed  from  Japan,  were  adopted.  In  the  years 
before  annexation,  a  self- strengthening  movement  and  government 
reforms  attempted  to  regain  Korean  control  of  the  pace  and  direc- 
tion of  change.  However,  it  was  only  following  the  Japanese  annex- 
ation in  1910  that  the  rapid  social  transformation  of  Korea  began. 

Rural  society  was  radically  transformed.  Traditionally,  all  land 
belonged  to  the  king  and  was  granted  by  him  to  his  subjects. 
Although  specific  parcels  of  land  tended  to  remain  within  the  same 
family  from  generation  to  generation  (including  communal  land 
owned  by  clans  and  lineages),  land  occupancy,  use,  and  owner- 
ship patterns  often  were  legally  ambiguous  and  widely  divergent 
from  one  part  of  the  country  to  another.  There  was  no  institution 
of  private  property  during  the  Choson  Dynasty.  The  Japanese, 
however,  conducted  a  comprehensive  land  survey  between  1910 
and  1920  in  order  to  place  landownership  on  a  modern  legal  foot- 
ing. Farmers  whose  families  had  tilled  the  same  soil  for  genera- 
tions but  could  not  prove  ownership  in  a  way  satisfactory  to  the 
colonial  authorities  had  their  land  confiscated.  Such  land  came  into 
the  hands  of  the  colonial  government,  to  be  sold  to  Japanese  land 
companies,  such  as  the  Oriental  Development  Company,  or  to 
Japanese  immigrants.  As  research  by  Edward  Graegert  has  shown, 
however,  the  survey  also  helped  to  confirm,  or  in  some  cases  even 
to  improve,  the  position  of  some  members  of  the  existing  Korean 
landlord  class.  Many  were  former  yangban  who  cooperated  with  the 
Japanese.  Those  yangban  who  remained  aloof  from  their  country's 
new  overlord  often  fell  into  poverty.  The  farmers  themselves  either 
became  tenants  or  were  forced  to  leave  the  land.  During  the  depres- 
sion of  the  1930s,  thousands  emigrated  to  the  cities  or  overseas. 
Many  others  fled  to  the  hills  to  become  'Tire-field"  (slash-and-burn) 
farmers,  living  under  extremely  harsh  and  primitive  conditions. 
By  1936  this  last  group  numbered  more  than  1.5  million  people. 

The  Japanese  built  railroads,  highways,  schools,  and  hospitals 
and  established  a  modern  system  of  administration.  These  changes 
were  intended  to  link  the  colonial  economy  more  effectively  to  that 
of  Japan.  The  new,  modern  sector  required  technically  trained  ex- 
perts. Although  the  top  positions  were  invariably  occupied  by 
Japanese,  Koreans  worked  on  the  lower  levels  as  secondary  technical

and  administrative  personnel.  Thus,  while  the  number  of  Korean 
high  officials  in  the  colonial  administration  increased  from  only  354 
to  442  people  between  1915  and  1942,  the  number  of  junior  offi- 
cials increased  from  15,543  to  29,998  in  the  same  period.  Japan's 
industrial  development  policies  during  the  1930s  and  1940s, 
although  concentrated  in  the  northern  half  of  the  peninsula  adja- 
cent to  Manchuria,  created  a  new  class  of  workers  and  lower-level 
industrial  managers  who  played  an  important  role  in  the  industrial 
development  of  South  Korea  after  1945. 

The  great  majority  of  Koreans  suffered  under  Japanese  rule.  A 
large  number  of  farmers  were  forced  off  their  land  after  1910;  in- 
dustrial workers  and  miners  working  for  Japanese-owned  firms  were 
often  treated  little  better  than  slaves.  Under  colonial  agricultural 
policies,  rice  cultivation  was  maximized,  although  most  rice  was 
grown  for  consumption  in  Japan. 

Nevertheless,  development  under  Japanese  colonial  rule  provided 
some  foundation,  however  unintentionally,  for  South  Korea's  im- 
pressive post- 1945  economic  growth  (see  Korea  under  Japanese 
Rule,  ch.  1).  A  small  group  of  Korean  entrepreneurs  emerged  who 
fostered  close  ties  with  the  colonial  government,  and  Japanese  busi- 
ness interests  established  family-held  firms  that  were  the  precursors 
of  South  Korea's  present-day  chaebol,  or  business  conglomerates. 
It  is  a  tribute  to  their  acumen  that  these  entrepreneurs  were  able 
to  survive  and  prosper  in  a  colonial  economy  dominated  overwhelm- 
ingly by  Japanese  capital. 

Three  developments  after  1945  were  particularly  important  for 
South  Korea's  social  modernization.  The  first  was  the  land  reform 
carried  out  by  United  States  and  South  Korean  authorities  between 
1945  and  1950.  The  institution  of  private  property  was  retained, 
but  the  American  occupation  authorities  confiscated  and  redistribut- 
ed all  land  held  by  the  Japanese  colonial  government,  Japanese 
companies,  and  individual  Japanese  colonists.  The  Korean  govern- 
ment also  carried  out  a  reform  whereby  Koreans  with  large  land- 
holdings  were  obliged  to  divest  most  of  their  land.  A  new  class  of 
independent,  family  proprietors  was  created. 

The  second  development  was  the  great  influx  from  North  Korea 
and  other  countries  of  repatriates  and  refugees.  In  the  1945-49  peri- 
od, between  1.5  million  and  2  million  Koreans  returned  to  South 
Korea  from  Japan,  the  northeast  provinces  of  China,  and  other 
foreign  countries.  With  the  establishment  of  a  communist  state  in 
North  Korea,  a  large  number  of  refugees  fled  to  South  Korea  and 
were  joined  by  many  more  during  the  Korean  War.  A  conservative 
estimate  of  the  total  number  of  refugees  from  the  north  is  1 .2  million.

Most  of  the  northerners  settled  in  the  cities — new  recruits  for  the 
country's  industrial  labor  force. 

The  third  development  was  a  direct  result  of  the  Korean  War. 
Traditionally  Koreans,  like  their  Chinese  and  unlike  their  Japanese 
neighbors,  considered  the  military  to  be  a  low-status  occupation. 
Korea  did  not  have  its  own  armed  forces  during  the  colonial  peri- 
od, although  some  Koreans  served  in  the  Japanese  military,  espe- 
cially after  1941,  and  a  handful,  such  as  former  President  Park 
Chung  Hee,  received  officer's  training.  The  North  Korean  inva- 
sion of  June  1950  and  the  three  years  of  fighting  that  followed  cast 
the  South  Korean  military  establishment  into  the  role  of  savior  of 
the  country.  And  since  the  coup  d'etat  of  May  1961  that  estab- 
lished Park  Chung  Hee,  the  military  establishment  has  held  con- 
siderable political  power.  Roh  Tae  Woo,  elected  president  in  1987, 
was  a  retired  general  with  close  connections  to  the  military  elite. 

Universal  military  conscription  of  men  has  played  an  important 
role  in  South  Korea's  development,  both  in  political  socialization 
and  in  integrating  a  society  divided  by  strong  regional  prejudices. 
It  also  has  exposed  the  nation's  young  men  to  technical  training 
and  to  a  disciplined  way  of  life. 

During  the  three  decades  after  Park's  1961  coup  d'etat,  the  goal 
of  the  military  elite  was  to  create  a  harmonious,  disciplined  society 
that  was  both  technically  advanced  and  economically  efficient.  Eco- 
nomic modernization,  however,  has  brought  social  changes — 
especially  in  education  and  urbanization — that  have  had  a  corro- 
sive effect  on  the  military's  authoritarian  view  of  society  and  have 
promoted  the  emergence  of  a  more  contentious,  pluralistic  society 
than  many  in  the  military  have  found  desirable. 

Social  Classes  in  Contemporary  South  Korea 

Rapid  economic  growth,  industrialization,  and  urbanization  have 
caused  a  profound  transformation  in  the  class  structure  of  South 
Korean  society  since  the  end  of  the  Korean  War.  One  of  the  most 
important  changes  has  been  the  emergence  of  a  "new"  middle  class 
consisting  of  civil  servants,  salaried  white-collar  workers  in  large 
private  companies,  and  professionals  with  specialized  training,  such 
as  engineers,  health  care  professionals,  university  professors,  archi- 
tects, and  journalists.  The  number  of  factory  workers  also  has  grown 
impressively.  According  to  figures  provided  by  Kim  Kyong-Dong, 
a  sociologist  at  Seoul  National  University,  the  portion  of  the  popula- 
tion that  can  be  labeled  "new  middle  class"  (excluding  self- 
employed  professionals)  grew  from  6.6  percent  to  17.7  percent 
between  1960  and  1980.  The  proportion  of  industrial  workers 
expanded  from  8.9  percent  to  22.6  percent  of  the  labor  force  during 


96 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


the  same  period.  Independent  farmers  and  members  of  the  rural 
lower  class,  including  agricultural  laborers,  experienced  correspond- 
ing declines  in  percentage:  together,  they  accounted  for  64  per- 
cent of  the  population  in  1960  but  only  31.3  percent  in  1980. 

The  urban  lower  class,  consisting  to  a  great  extent  of  recent  arri- 
vals from  rural  parts  of  the  country  living  in  squatter  areas,  com- 
posed an  estimated  6.6  percent  of  the  population  in  1960  and  5.9 
percent  in  1980.  An  "old"  middle  class  consisting  of  shopkeepers 
and  small  business  proprietors  in  urban  and  rural  areas,  self- 
employed  professionals,  and  self-employed  craftsmen  grew  modestiy 
from  13  percent  to  20.8  percent  of  the  population  between  1960 
and  1980.  Kim's  figures  also  include  what  he  euphemistically  calls 
an  "upper-middle"  class — the  country's  economic  and  social  elites, 
whose  numbers  grew  from  0.9  percent  to  1 .8  percent  of  the  popu- 
lation between  1960  and  1980. 

Another  way  of  viewing  contemporary  South  Korean  society  is 
to  consider  the  sources  of  social  inequality.  In  a  1988  article,  Korea 
specialist  David  I.  Steinberg  focused  on  several  of  these  sources, 
which  include  the  disparity  in  living  standards  between  urban  and 
rural  areas — the  main  motivation  behind  sustained  urban  migra- 
tion. Although  the  Saemaul  Movement  was  successful  in  narrowing 
the  gap  between  rural  and  urban  incomes  during  the  mid-1970s, 
disparities  subsequently  reemerged.  Steinberg  also  noted  that 
despite  the  land  reform  of  the  late  1940s,  tenancy  has  grown,  and 
that  by  1981  as  many  as  46  percent  of  all  farmers  were  "full  or 
partial  tenants." 

Discrimination  on  both  the  community  and  individual  levels 
against  the  people  of  North  C holla  and  South  C holla  provinces  re- 
mains a  second  important  source  of  inequality.  Disparities  in  per 
capita  income  between  Seoul  and  the  provinces  of  North  and  South 
Kyongsang  had  virtually  disappeared  by  the  early  1980s,  but  per 
capita  incomes  in  the  capital  were  still  1 .8  times  those  in  the  Chol- 
la  region  in  1983.  As  in  most  other  Asian  (and  most  Western)  coun- 
tries, gender  differences  remain  another  source  of  major  inequalities 
(see  Changing  Role  of  Women,  this  ch.). 

Government  control  of  the  financial  system  has  created  substan- 
tial inequalities  between  the  favored  chaebol,  which  at  least  until 
the  late  1980s  had  access  to  credit  at  low  rates,  and  capital- starved 
smaller  businesses  that  had  to  rely  on  nonbank  sources  of  credit. 
Official  support  of  the  chaebol  as  the  engines  of  South  Korean  eco- 
nomic growth  and  industrialization  was  clearly  reflected  in  the  dif- 
ferences between  salaries  and  working  conditions  of  employees  in 
large  and  small  enterprises.  Also,  the  Park  and  Chun  regimes' 
hostile  policies  toward  labor  unions  kept  workers'  wages  low — and 


97 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

internationally  competitive.  In  Steinberg's  words,  "The  Korean 
worker  has  been  asked  to  suffer  for  the  good  of  society  as  a 
whole  .  .  .  . "  Activists  who  tried  to  organize  independent  unions 
were  harassed,  arrested,  imprisoned,  and  frequently  tortured  by 
the  authorities.  During  the  liberalization  that  began  in  1987, 
however,  the  government  permitted  the  establishment  of  indepen- 
dent labor  unions  and  assumed  a  new  attitude,  at  times  approaching 
neutrality  in  labor-management  disputes  (see  Interest  Groups,  ch.  4). 

Education  remained  the  single  most  important  factor  affecting 
social  mobility  in  the  1990s.  With  the  exception  of  the  military, 
whose  top  echelons  were  educated  at  the  Korea  Military  Academy, 
the  postwar  elites  of  South  Korea  shared  one  characteristic:  they 
were  graduates  of  the  most  prestigious  universities.  There  was  a 
well-defined  hierarchy  of  such  schools,  starting  with  Seoul  National 
University  at  the  top  and  followed  by  Yonse  University  and  Koryo 
University  (more  commonly  known  as  Korea  University  in  En- 
glish). Ehwa  Woman's  University  was  the  top  institution  for  women 
(see  Education,  this  ch.). 

A  survey  conducted  in  the  mid-1970s  by  the  Korea  Develop- 
ment Institute,  a  research  organization  funded  by  the  government 
but  having  considerable  operational  independence,  revealed  that 
25  percent  of  a  sample  of  entrepreneurs  and  35  percent  of  a  sam- 
ple of  higher  civil  servants  had  attended  Seoul  National  Universi- 
ty. The  university's  control  of  entry  into  the  government  and 
business  elites  is  comparable  to  that  exercised  by  the  University 
of  Tokyo  in  Japan.  One  major  difference,  however,  is  that  for  a 
Japanese  student  an  extended  period  of  study  or  residence  abroad 
is  not  considered  advisable  because  it  interrupts  one's  career 
"track"  within  a  single  bureaucracy  or  corporation;  many  promi- 
nent South  Koreans,  however,  obtain  advanced  degrees  at  univer- 
sities in  the  United  States  and  in  Western  Europe. 

The  social  importance  of  education  is  one  of  the  major  continui- 
ties between  traditional  and  contemporary  Korea.  People  at  the 
top  require  blue-ribbon  educational  backgrounds,  not  only  because 
education  gives  them  the  cultural  sophistication  and  technical  ex- 
pertise needed  to  manage  large,  complex  organizations,  but  also 
because  subordinates  will  not  work  diligently  for  an  uneducated 
person — especially  if  subordinates  are  educated  themselves.  "Old 
school  ties"  are  also  increasingly  necessary  for  advancement  in  a 
highly  competitive  society.  At  the  bottom  of  the  steep  higher- 
education  pyramid  are  low-prestige  "diploma  mills"  whose  gradu- 
ates have  little  chance  of  breaking  into  elite  circles.  Yet  gradua- 
tion even  from  these  institutions  confers  a  sort  of  middle-class  status. 


98 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Despite  impressive  increases  in  university  enrollments,  the  cen- 
tral importance  of  education  credentials  for  social  advancement  has 
tended  to  widen  the  gap  between  the  middle  and  lower  classes.  In- 
come distribution  is  more  unequal  than  in  Japan  or  Taiwan,  with 
pronounced  disparities  between  college  and  secondary- school  gradu- 
ates. Many  workers  know  that  their  comparatively  low  wages  make 
it  virtually  impossible  for  them  to  give  their  children  a  college  edu- 
cation, a  heavy  financial  burden  even  for  middle-class  families. 

In  the  workplace,  men  and  women  with  a  middle- school  or 
secondary-school  education  are  often  treated  with  open  contempt 
by  university  graduate  managers.  The  latter  address  them  with  rude 
or  abrupt  words  whose  impact  is  amplified  by  the  status-sensitive 
nature  of  the  Korean  language  (see  The  Korean  Language,  this 
ch.).  The  result  has  been  bitter  resentment  and  increasing  labor 
militancy  bordering  on  political  opposition  to  the  status  quo. 

During  the  1980s,  the  concept  of  minjung  (the  masses)  became 
prominent  in  the  thinking  and  rhetoric  of  radical  students,  mili- 
tant labor  unionists,  activists  identified  with  the  Christian  churches, 
and  progressive  but  generally  non-Marxist  intellectuals.  Although 
its  meaning  is  vague,  minjung  encompasses  not  only  the  urban 
proletariat  in  the  Marxist  sense  but  also  the  groups,  including  farm- 
ers, small  bourgeoisie,  students,  and  skilled  craftsmen,  who  allegedly 
have  been  exploited  by  the  country's  numerically  small  ruling  class 
(the  military  elite,  top  bureaucrats,  and  big  business).  National 
elites  were  viewed  as  collaborating  with  foreign  (particularly  United 
States  and  Japanese)  capitalists  in  order  to  create  a  situation  of  per- 
manent dependence  on  foreign  capital.  The  emphasis  on  neo- 
colonialist  themes  by  minjung  spokespeople  drew  deeply  on  South 
Korean  populist,  nationalist,  and  xenophobic  sentiments  to  place 
the  origin  of  social  evils  outside  the  Korean  race. 

Traditional  Family  Life 

Filial  piety  {hyo  in  Korean;  xiao  in  Chinese),  the  second  of  the 
Five  Relationships,  defined  by  Mencius  as  affection  between  father 
and  son,  traditionally  has  been  the  normative  foundation  of  Korean 
family  life.  Though  its  influence  has  diminished  over  time,  this  rela- 
tionship remains  vitally  important  in  contemporary  South  Korea. 
Entailing  a  large  number  of  reciprocal  duties  and  responsibilities 
between  the  generations  of  a  single  family,  it  generally  has  been 
viewed  as  an  unequal  relationship  in  which  the  son  owed  the  father 
unquestioning  obedience.  Neo-Confucianists  thought  that  the 
subordination  of  son  to  father  was  the  expression,  on  the  human 
level,  of  an  immutable  law  of  the  cosmos.  This  law  also  imposed 
a  rigidity  on  family  life.

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

Family  and  lineage  continuity  traditionally  was,  and  to  a  great 
extent  remains,  a  supremely  important  principle.  This  principle 
reflects  Mencius's  view  that  of  all  possible  unfilial  acts,  to  deprive 
one's  parents  of  posterity  is  the  worst.  Historically,  the  Korean 
family  has  been  patrilineal.  The  most  important  concern  for  the 
family  group  was  producing  a  male  heir  to  carry  on  the  family  line 
and  to  perform  ancestor  rituals  in  the  household  and  at  the  family 
gravesite.  The  first  son  customarily  assumed  leadership  of  the  fam- 
ily after  his  father's  death  and  inherited  his  father's  house  and  a 
greater  portion  of  land  than  his  younger  brothers.  This  inheritance 
enabled  him  to  carry  out  the  ritually  prescribed  obligations  to  his 
ancestors. 

Ancestor  worship  was,  simultaneously,  a  social  ethic  and  a 
religion.  In  some  ways,  it  was  the  most  optimistic  of  faiths.  It  taught 
that  deceased  family  members  do  not  pass  into  oblivion,  to  an  after- 
life, or,  as  the  Buddhists  believe,  to  rebirth  as  humans  or  animals 
in  some  remote  place,  but  remain,  in  spiritual  form,  securely  within 
the  family  circle.  For  traditionally  minded  Koreans,  the  presence 
of  the  deceased  could  be  an  intensely  real  and  personal  one.  Fear 
of  death  was  blunted  by  the  consoling  thought  that  even  in  the  grave 
one  would  be  cared  for  by  one's  own  people.  Succeeding  genera- 
tions had  the  obligation  of  remembering  the  deceased  in  a  yearly 
cycle  of  rituals  and  ceremonies. 

Traditionally,  the  purpose  of  marriage  was  to  produce  a  male 
heir  to  carry  on  the  family  line  rather  than  to  provide  mutual  com- 
panionship and  support  for  husband  and  wife.  Marriages  were 
arranged.  A  go-between  or  matchmaker,  usually  a  middle-aged 
woman,  carried  on  the  negotiations  between  the  two  families  in- 
volved who,  because  of  a  very  strict  law  of  exogamy,  sometimes 
did  not  know  each  other  and  often  lived  in  different  communities. 
The  bride  and  groom  met  for  the  first  time  at  the  marriage  cere- 
mony, a  practice  that  ended  in  the  cities  by  the  1930s. 

The  traditional  Korean  kinship  system,  defined  by  different  obli- 
gations in  relation  to  ancestor  worship,  was  complex.  Anthropolo- 
gists generally  view  it  in  terms  of  four  separate  levels,  beginning 
with  the  household  on  the  lowest  level  and  reaching  to  the  clan, 
which  included  a  large  number  of  persons  often  spread  over  an 
extensive  geographical  area.  The  household,  chip  or  jip  (see  Glos- 
sary) in  Korean,  consisted  of  husband  and  wife,  their  children,  and 
if  the  husband  were  the  eldest  son,  his  parents  as  well.  The  eldest 
son's  household,  the  stem  family,  was  known  as  the  "big  house" 
(k'unjip),  whereas  that  of  each  of  the  younger  sons,  a  branch  family 
containing  husband,  wife  and  children  only,  was  known  as  the  "little 
house"  (chagunjip).  It  was  through  the  stem  family  of  the  eldest  son 


100

dance  performance

that  the  main  line  of  descent  was  traced  from  generation  to  gener- 
ation. The  eldest  son  was  responsible  for  rituals  in  honor  of  the 
ancestors,  and  his  wife  was  responsible  for  producing  the  all- 
important  male  heir. 

The  second  level  of  kinship  was  the  "mourning  group"  (tangnae), 
which  consisted  of  all  those  descendants  of  a  common  patrilineal 
forbearer  up  to  four  generations  back.  Its  role  was  to  organize 
ceremonies  at  the  grave  site.  These  rites  included  the  reading  of 
a  formal  message  by  the  eldest  male  descendant  of  the  tangnae  pro- 
genitor and  the  offering  of  elaborate  and  attractive  dishes  to  the 
ancestral  spirits. 

Similar  rituals  were  carried  out  at  the  third  level  of  kinship  or- 
ganization, the  lineage  (p'a — see  Glossary).  A  lineage  might  com- 
prise only  a  handful  of  households,  but  in  some  cases  included 
hundreds  and  even  thousands  of  households.  The  lineage  was 
responsible  for  the  rites  honoring  ancestors  of  the  fifth  generation 
or  above,  performed  at  a  common  grave  site.  During  the  Choson 
Dynasty,  the  lineage  commonly  possessed  land,  grave  sites,  and 
buildings.  Croplands  were  allocated  to  support  the  ancestral  ceremo- 
nies. The  lineage  also  performed  other  functions:  the  aid  of  poor 
or  distressed  lineage  members,  the  education  of  children  at  schools 
maintained  by  the  p  'a,  and  the  supervision  of  the  behavior  of  youn- 
ger lineage  members.  Because  most  villagers  were  members  of  a 
common  lineage  during  the  Choson  Dynasty,  the  p'a  performed

many  of  the  social  services  on  the  local  level  that  are  now  provided 
by  public  schools,  police,  and  social  welfare  agencies. 

The  fourth  and  most  inclusive  kinship  organization  was  the  clan, 
or,  more  accurately,  the  tongjok  (surname  origin  group).  Among 
ordinary  South  Koreans,  this  group  was  commonly  known  as  the 
pongwan,  or  "clan  seat."  Members  of  the  same  tongjok  shared  both 
a  surname  and  origins  in  the  generally  remote  past.  Unlike  mem- 
bers of  the  smaller  kinship  groups,  however,  they  often  lacked  strong 
feelings  of  solidarity.  Important  tongjok  include  the  Chonju  Yi,  whose 
lineage  seat  was  in  Chonju  in  North  Cholla  Province  and  who 
claimed  as  their  progenitor  the  founder  of  the  Choson  Dynasty, 
Yi  Song-gye;  and  the  Kimhae  Kim,  whose  lineage  seat  was  in  Kim- 
hae  in  South  Kyongsang  Province  and  who  claimed  as  their  com- 
mon ancestor  either  the  founder  of  the  ancient  kingdom  of  Kaya 
or  one  of  the  kings  of  the  Silla  Dynasty  (A.D.  668-935). 

Approximately  249  surnames  were  used  by  South  Koreans  in 
the  late  1980s.  The  most  common  were  Kim  (about  22  percent  of 
the  population),  Li  or  Yi  (15  percent  of  the  population),  Pak  or 
Park  (8.5  percent),  Ch'oe  (4.8  percent),  and  Chong  (4.2  percent). 
There  are,  however,  about  150  surname  origin  groups  bearing  the 
name  Kim,  95  with  the  name  Yi,  35  with  the  name  Pak,  40  with 
the  name  Ch'oe,  and  27  with  the  name  Chong. 

In  many  if  not  most  cases,  the  real  function  of  the  tongjok  was 
to  define  groups  of  permissible  marriage  partners.  Because  of  the 
strict  rule  of  exogamy,  people  from  the  same  tongjok  were  not  per- 
mitted to  marry,  even  though  their  closest  common  ancestors  in 
many  cases  might  have  lived  centuries  ago.  This  prohibition,  which 
originated  during  the  Choson  Dynasty,  had  legal  sanction  in 
present-day  South  Korea.  An  amendment  to  the  marriage  law  pro- 
posed by  women's  and  other  groups  in  early  1990  would  have 
changed  this  situation  by  prohibiting  marriages  only  between  per- 
sons who  had  a  common  ancestor  five  generations  or  less  back. 
However,  the  amendment  was  strongly  opposed  by  conservative 
Confucian  groups,  which  viewed  the  exogamy  law  as  a  crystalli- 
zation of  traditional  Korean  values.  Among  older  South  Koreans, 
it  is  still  commonly  thought  that  only  uncivilized  people  marry 
within  their  clan  group.

the  start  of  the  1990s  exhibits  a  number  of  departures  from  tradi- 
tional family  and  kinship  institutions.  One  example  is  the  tenden- 
cy for  complex  kinship  and  family  structures  to  weaken  or  break 
down  and  be  replaced  by  structurally  simpler  two- generation,

nuclear  families.  Another  closely  related  trend  is  the  movement 
toward  equality  in  family  relations  and  the  resulting  improvement 
in  the  status  of  women.  Thirdly,  there  is  a  movement  away  from 
lineage-  and  neighborhood-based  social  relations  toward  functionally 
based  relations.  People  in  the  cities  no  longer  work  among  their 
relatives  or  neighbors  in  the  fields  or  on  fishing  boats,  but  among 
unrelated  people  in  factories,  shops,  and  offices.  Finally,  there  is 
an  increasing  tendency  for  an  individual's  location  and  personal 
associations  to  be  transitory  and  temporary  rather  than  permanent 
and  lifelong,  although  the  importance  of  school  ties  is  pivotal.  There 
is  greater  physical  mobility  as  improved  transportation  facilities, 
superhighways,  and  rapid  express  trains  make  it  possible  to  travel 
between  cities  in  a  few  hours.  Subsidiary  transportation  networks 
have  broken  down  barriers  between  once-isolated  villages  and  the 
urban  areas  (see  Transportation  and  Telecommunications,  ch.  3). 
Mobility  in  human  relations  also  is  becoming  more  apparent  as 
people  change  their  residences  more  frequently,  often  because  of 
employment,  and  an  increasing  proportion  of  the  urban  popula- 
tion lives  in  large,  impersonal  apartment  complexes. 

Matchmaking  was  a  big  business  in  Seoul  and  other  cities  in  con- 
temporary society;  coffee  shops  and  lounges  often  were  crowded 
on  weekends.  In  a  change  from  traditional  society,  prospective 
brides  and  grooms  held  scores  of  interviews,  sonpogi,  before  deciding 
on  the  companion  they  would  like  to  date-for-marriage.  Many  of 
these  young  men  and  women  changed  their  minds  after  these  dates, 
and  the  process  began  again.  Yonae,  or  "love  match"  marriages, 
occurred  with  increasing  frequency. 

Contrary  to  the  Confucian  ideal,  the  nuclear  family  consisting 
of  a  husband,  wife,  and  children  is  becoming  predominant  in  con- 
temporary South  Korea.  It  differs  from  the  traditional  "branch 
family,"  or  "little  house"  (chagunjip),  for  two  reasons:  the  conju- 
gal relationship  between  husband  and  wife  tends  to  take  precedence 
over  the  relationship  between  the  son  and  his  parents,  and  the 
nuclear  family  unit  is  becoming  increasingly  independent,  both  eco- 
nomically and  psychologically,  of  larger  kinship  groups.  These 
developments  have  led  to  greater  equality  among  the  family  units 
established  by  the  eldest  and  younger  sons.  Whereas  the  isolated 
nuclear  family  was  perceived  in  the  past  as  a  sign  of  poverty  and 
misfortune,  the  contemporary  nuclear  family  is  often  viewed  as  the 
result  of  a  conscious  choice  made  by  those  who  do  not  wish  their 
privacy  invaded  by  intrusive  relatives. 

Economic  relations  between  the  generations  of  a  single  family 
changed  radically  in  the  transition  from  traditional  rural  to  modern 
urban  society.  In  the  past,  the  male  head  of  the  patrilineal  family 


103 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


controlled  all  the  property,  usually  in  the  form  of  land,  and  was 
generally  the  sole  provider  of  economic  support.  With  the  develop- 
ment of  modern  industry  and  services,  however,  each  adult  gener- 
ation and  nuclear  family  unit  has  become  more  or  less  economi- 
cally independent,  although  sons  might  depend  upon  their  parents 
or  even  their  wife's  parents  for  occasional  economic  assistance — 
for  example,  in  purchasing  a  house.  Because  urban  families  usually 
live  apart  from  their  paternal  in-laws,  even  when  the  householder 
is  the  eldest  son,  the  wife  no  longer  has  to  endure  the  domination 
of  her  mother-in-law  and  sister-in-law.  In  many  cases,  the  family 
is  closer  to  the  wife's  parents  than  to  the  husband's.  The  modern 
husband  and  wife  often  are  closer  emotionally  than  in  the  old  fam- 
ily system.  They  spend  more  time  together  and  even  go  out  so- 
cially, a  formerly  unheard-of  practice.  Yet  the  expectation  still 
remains  that  elderly  parents  will  live  with  one  of  their  children, 
preferably  a  son,  rather  than  on  their  own  or  in  nursing  homes. 
This  expectation  could  change  in  the  last  decade  of  the  century, 
however,  with  the  expansion  of  health  care  and  social  welfare  fa- 
cilities. 

Outside  the  nuclear  family,  blood  relationships  still  are  impor- 
tant, particularly  among  close  relatives,  such  as  members  of  the 
same  tangnae,  or  mourning  group.  Relations  with  more  distant  rela- 
tives, such  as  members  of  the  same  lineage,  tend  to  be  weak,  espe- 
cially if  the  lineage  has  its  roots  in  a  distant  rural  village,  as  most 
do.  Ancestor  rites  are  practiced  in  urban  homes,  although  for  few- 
er generations  than  formerly:  the  majority  of  urban  dwellers  seem 
to  conduct  rites  only  in  honor  of  the  father  and  mother  of  the  fam- 
ily head.  As  a  result,  there  are  far  fewer  ancestors  to  venerate  and 
far  fewer  occasions  on  which  to  hold  the  household  ceremonies. 
In  some  ways,  however,  increased  geographical  mobility  has  helped 
to  preserve  family  solidarity.  In  the  late  1980s,  during  New  Year's, 
Hansik  (Cold  Food  Day  in  mid- April),  and  Ch'usok  (the  Autumn 
Harvest  Festival  in  mid- September),  the  airplanes,  trains,  and  high- 
ways were  jammed  with  people  traveling  to  visit  both  living  rela- 
tives and  grave  sites  in  their  ancestral  communities. 

Changing  Role  of  Women 

During  the  Koryo  and  early  Choson  Dynasties,  it  was  customary 
for  the  married  couple  to  live  in  the  wife's  parents'  household.  This 
arrangement  suggests  that  the  status  of  women  was  then  higher 
than  it  was  later  during  most  of  the  Choson  Dynasty.  Neo- 
Confucian  orthodoxy  dictated  that  the  woman,  separated  from  her 
parents,  had  a  primary  duty  of  providing  a  male  heir  for  her  hus- 
band's family.  According  to  Confucian  custom,  once  married,  a 


104 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


woman  had  to  leave  her  parents'  household  permanently  and  then 
occupy  the  lowest  position  in  her  husband's  family.  She  was  often 
abused  and  mistreated  by  both  her  mother-in-law  and  sisters-in- 
law — at  least  until  the  birth  of  a  son  gave  her  some  status  in  her 
husband's  family.  The  relationship  between  wife  and  husband  was 
often,  if  not  usually,  distant,  aptiy  described  by  the  Korean  proverb: 
"By  day,  like  seeing  a  stranger;  by  night,  like  seeing  a  lover."  Cho- 
son  Dynasty  law  prohibited  widows  from  remarrying,  although  a 
similar  prohibition  was  not  extended  to  widowers.  Further,  the  sons 
and  grandsons  of  widows  who  defied  the  ban,  like  children  of  second- 
ary wives,  were  not  allowed  to  take  the  civil  service  examinations 
and  become  scholar-officials. 

The  duty  of  a  woman  to  her  husband,  or  rather  to  her  husband's 
family,  was  absolute  and  unquestionable.  In  the  traditional  society, 
only  men  could  obtain  a  divorce.  A  husband  could  divorce  his  spouse 
if  she  were  barren — barrenness  being  defined  simply  as  the  inabili- 
ty to  bear  sons.  Even  if  a  husband  did  not  divorce  his  wife,  he  had 
the  right  to  take  a  second  wife,  although  the  preferred  solution  for 
a  man  without  a  son  during  the  Choson  Dynasty  was  to  adopt  a 
son  of  one  of  his  brothers,  if  available.  The  incompatibility 
of  a  wife  and  her  in-laws  was  also  grounds  for  divorce. 

In  contemporary  society,  both  men  and  women  have  the  right 
to  obtain  a  divorce.  Social  and  economic  discrimination,  however, 
makes  the  lot  of  divorced  women  more  difficult.  The  husband  may 
still  demand  custody  of  the  children,  although  a  revision  of  the  Family 
Law  in  1977  made  it  more  difficult  for  him  to  coerce  or  to  deceive 
his  wife  into  agreeing  to  an  unfair  settlement.  The  rate  of  divorce 
in  South  Korea  is  increasing  rapidly.  In  1975  the  number  of  divorces 
was  17,000.  In  the  mid-1980s,  the  annual  number  of  divorces  was 
between  23,000  and  26,000,  and  in  1987  there  were  45,000  divorces. 

The  tradition  of  total  female  submission  persisted  in  Korean  vil- 
lages until  relatively  recent  times.  One  Korean  scholar  who  came 
from  the  conservative  Ch'ungch'ong  region  south  of  Seoul  recalled 
that  when  a  high  school  friend  died  of  sickness  during  the  1940s, 
his  young  bride  committed  suicide.  Her  act  was  commemorated  in 
her  own  and  the  surrounding  communities  as  an  outstanding  ex- 
ample of  devotion  to  duty. 

Traditionally,  men  and  women  were  strictiy  segregated,  both  in- 
side and  outside  the  house.  Yangban  women  spent  most  of  their  lives 
in  seclusion  in  the  women's  chamber.  It  is  said  that  the  traditional 
pastime  of  nolttwigi,  a  game  of  jumping  up  and  down  on  a  seesaw- 
like contraption,  originated  among  bored  women  who  wanted  to 
peek  over  the  high  walls  of  their  family  compounds  to  see 


105

what  the  outside  world  was  like.  Economic  necessity  gave  women 
of  the  lower  classes  some  freedom  as  they  participated  in  farm  work 
and  sometimes  earned  supplemental  income  through  making  and 
selling  things. 

A  small  minority  of  women  played  an  active  role  in  society  and 
even  wielded  political  influence.  These  people  included  female  sha- 
mans (mudang),  who  were  called  upon  to  cure  illnesses,  tell  fortunes, 
or  in  other  ways  enlist  the  help  of  spirits  in  realizing  the  wishes 
of  their  clients.  Despite  its  sponsorship  of  neo-Confucianism,  the 
Ghoson  Dynasty  had  an  office  of  shamanism,  and  female  shamans 
often  were  quite  influential  in  the  royal  palace.  The  female  physi- 
cians who  treated  female  patients  (because  male  physicians  were 
forbidden  to  examine  them)  constituted  another  important  group 
of  women.  Sometimes  they  acted  as  spies  or  policewomen  because 
they  could  get  into  the  female  quarters  of  a  house.  Still  another 
group  of  women  were  the  kisaeng.  Some  kisaeng,  or  entertainers, 
were  merely  prostitutes;  but  others,  like  their  Japanese  counter- 
parts the  geisha,  were  talented  musicians,  dancers,  painters,  and 
poets  and  interacted  on  nearly  equal  terms  with  their  male  patrons. 
The  kisaeng  tradition  perpetuated  one  of  the  more  dubious  legacies 
of  the  Confucian  past:  an  extreme  double  standard  concerning  the 
sexual  behavior  of  married  men  and  women  that  still  persists.  In 
the  cities,  however,  many  middle  class  women  have  begun  to  break 
with  these  traditions. 

An  interesting  regional  variation  on  traditional  female  roles  con- 
tinued in  the  late  1980s.  In  the  coastal  villages  of  Cheju  Island, 
women  divers  swam  in  search  of  seaweed,  oysters,  and  other  ma- 
rine products  and  were  economically  self-sufficient.  Often  they 
provided  the  main  economic  support  for  the  family  while  the  hus- 
band did  subsidiary  work — took  care  of  the  children  and  did  house- 
hold chores — in  sharp  contrast  to  the  Confucian  norm.  The  number 
of  women  divers  was  dwindling,  however,  and  men  were  increas- 
ingly performing  jobs  in  service  industries.  Confucian  ancestor  wor- 
ship was  rarely  practiced;  female-centered  shamanistic  rites, 
however,  were  widespread. 

The  factories  of  South  Korea  employ  hundreds  of  thousands  of 
young  women  on  shop  floors  and  assembly  lines  making,  among 
other  things,  textiles  and  clothes,  shoes,  and  electronic  components. 
South  Korea's  economic  success  was  bought  in  large  measure  with 
the  sweat  of  these  generally  overworked  and  poorly  paid  female 
laborers.  In  the  offices  of  banks  and  other  service  enterprises,  young 
women  working  as  clerks  and  secretaries  are  indispensable.  Un- 
like their  sisters  on  Cheju  Island,  however,  the  majority  of  these 
women  work  only  until  marriage.

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 

Although  increasing  numbers  of  women  work  outside  the  home, 
the  dominant  conception,  particularly  for  the  college-educated  mid- 
dle class,  is  that  the  husband  is  the  "outside  person,"  the  one  whose 
employment  provides  the  main  source  of  economic  support;  the 
wife  is  the  "inside  person,"  whose  chief  responsibility  is  main- 
tenance of  the  household,  Women  tend  to  leave  the  labor  force  when 
they  get  married.  Many  women  manage  the  family  finances,  and 
a  large  number  join  kye,  informal  private  short-term  credit  associ- 
ations that  give  them  access  to  funds  that  might  not  be  obtainable 
from  a  conventional  bank.  Probably  the  most  important  responsi- 
bility of  married  women  is  the  management  of  their  children's 
education. 

On  the  surface,  Korean  women  often  appear  docile,  submissive, 
and  deferential  to  the  wishes  of  their  husbands  and  in-laws.  Yet 
behind  the  scenes,  there  is  often  considerable  "hidden"  female  pow- 
er, particularly  within  the  private  sphere  of  the  household.  In  areas 
such  as  household  finances,  South  Korean  husbands  usually  defer 
to  their  wives'  judgment.  Public  assertion  of  a  woman's  power, 
however,  is  socially  disapproved,  and  a  traditional  wife  maintained 
the  image,  if  not  the  reality  of  submissiveness.  And,  as  in  other 
male-dominated  societies,  Korean  men  often  jokingly  complain  that 
they  are  henpecked. 

In  traditional  Korean  society,  women  received  little  formal  edu- 
cation. Christian  missionaries  began  establishing  schools  for  girls 
during  the  late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries.  Ehwa 
Woman's  University,  the  most  prestigious  women's  institution, 
began  as  a  primary  school  established  by  Methodist  missionaries 
in  1886  and  achieved  university  status  after  1945.  Chongsin  Girls' 
School  and  Paehwa  Girls'  School  were  founded  in  1890  and  1898, 
respectively,  in  Seoul.  Songui  Girls'  School  was  established  in  1903 
in  P'yongyang.  By  1987  there  were  ten  institutions  of  higher  edu- 
cation for  women,  including  universities,  colleges,  and  junior  col- 
leges; women  accounted  for  approximately  28  percent  of  total  en- 
rollment in  higher  education.  There  were  approximately  262,500 
women  students  in  colleges  and  universities  in  1987.  However,  only 
about  16  percent  of  college  and  university  teachers  were  women 
in  1987. 

The  growing  number  of  women  receiving  a  college  education 
has  meant  that  their  sex  role  differs  from  that  of  their  mothers  and 
grandmothers.  Many  college-educated  women  plan  independent 
careers  and  challenge  the  right  of  parents  to  choose  a  marriage  part- 
ner. The  often  fierce  battles  between  university  students  and  police 
during  the  late  1980s  included  female  participants.  A  correspon- 
dent for  the  Far  Eastern  Economic  Review  quoted  a  male  student  leader 


107 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

as  saying  that  "short  girls  make  great  demonstrators,  as  they're 
very  tough  and  very  hard  to  catch. ' '  Whether  politically  active  South 
Korean  university  women  will  follow  their  Japanese  counterparts, 
who  demonstrated  during  the  1960s  and  1970s,  into  a  world  of  child- 
raising  and  placid  consumerism  remains  to  be  seen.  The  number 
of  employed  married  women,  however,  increased  by  approximately 
12.6  percent  annually  in  the  years  since  1977. 

In  1983,  51.8  percent  of  women  living  in  rural  areas  were  em- 
ployed as  compared  with  37.8  percent  of  women  living  in  urban 
areas.  Most  of  the  women  working  in  rural  areas  were  over  the 
age  of  thirty,  as  young  females  (and  males)  tended  to  move  to,  and 
seek  employment  in,  cities  and  industrial  areas. 

Official  South  Korean  statistics  indicated  that  43.6  percent  of 
women  were  in  the  work  force  by  1988.  Prospects  for  lower  class 
women,  however,  were  frequendy  grim.  In  some  cases,  they  were 
obliged  to  become  part  of  the  "entertainment  industry"  in  order 
to  survive  economically.  According  to  one  estimate,  brothels,  bars, 
massage  parlors,  discos,  and  what  are  known  as  "Taiwan  style" 
barbershops  (that  is,  those  often  employing  a  greater  number  of 
masseuses  than  barbers)  employed  as  many  as  1  million  women, 
though  not  all  were  prostitutes.  This  underworld  of  abuse,  exploi- 
tation, and  bitter  shame  had  begun  to  be  criticized  and  exposed 
by  women's  activists. 

Cultural  Identity 

South  Korea's  homogeneous  population  shares  a  common  eth- 
nic, cultural,  and  linguistic  heritage.  National  self-image  is,  on  one 
level,  unambiguously  defined  by  the  convergence  of  territorial,  eth- 
nic, linguistic,  and  cultural  identities  (see  Population,  this  ch.).  Yet 
intense  feelings  of  nationalism,  so  evident  in  athletic  events  like 
the  1986  Asian  Games  and  the  1988  Olympic  Games  held  in  Seoul, 
revealed  anxiety  as  well  as  pride  concerning  South  Korea's  place 
in  the  world.  More  than  Western  peoples  and  even  more  than  the 
Japanese,  South  Korean  individuals  are  inclined  to  view  themselves 
as  a  tightly  knit  national  community  with  a  common  destiny.  In 
a  rapidly  changing  world,  however,  it  is  often  difficult  for  them 
to  define  exactly  what  being  a  South  Korean  is.  To  outsiders,  the 
intense  concern  with  identity  is  perhaps  difficult  to  understand; 
it  reflects  a  history  of  subordinate  relations  to  powerful  foreign  states 
and  the  tragedy  of  national  division  after  World  War  II. 

Many  modernized,  urban-dwelling  South  Koreans  embark  on  a 
search  for  the  "essence"  of  their  culture,  which  commonly  expresses 
itself  as  hostility  to  foreign  influences.  For  example,  the  poet  Kim 
Chi-ha,  whose  opposition  to  the  Park  regime  in  the  1970s  was  a 


108 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


model  for  a  younger  generation  of  dissidents,  attacked  the  govern- 
ment as  much  for  its  neglect  of  traditional  values  as  for  its  antidemo- 
cratic tendencies. 

Seoul  has  not  been  slow  to  employ  traditionalism  for  its  own  ends. 
In  1987  the  government  adopted  guidelines  for  the  revision  of  his- 
tory textbooks,  instructing  publishers  to  describe  the  foundation 
of  the  Korean  nation  by  Tan 'gun  in  2333  B.C.  as  "a  reflection 
of  historical  facts"  rather  than  simply  a  myth.  The  legendary  Tan- 
gun  was,  according  to  the  myth,  the  son  of  god  and  a  bear- woman. 
According  to  a  Far  Eastern  Economic  Review  commentator,  "...  peo- 
ple ranging  from  reputable  university  scholars  to  chauvinist  mys- 
tics regard  Tan 'gun  as  the  personification  of  ethics  and  values  that 
emphasize  a  native  Korean  identity  against  the  foreign  religions 
and  philosophies  of  Buddhism,  neo-Confucianism,  Christianity  and 
Marxism  that  have  otherwise  dominated  Korean  history  and 
thought. ' '  Tan'gun's  legendary  kingdom  is  older  than  China's  first 
legendary  dynasty,  the  Xia  (2205-1766  B.C.),  and  its  antiquity 
asserts  Korea's  cultural  autonomy  in  relation  to  its  largest  neigh- 
bor. There  have  been  proposals  that  the  government  subsidize  the 
rites  of  the  numerically  small  community  of  believers  in  Taejong- 
gyo  and  other  cults  that  worship  Tan 'gun. 

Problems  of  cultural  identity  are  closely  connected  to  the  trage- 
dy of  Korea's  division  into  two  hostile  states.  Many  members  of 
the  younger  generation  of  South  Koreans  born  after  the  Korean 
War  fervently  embrace  the  cause  of  t'ongil,  or  reunification,  and 
believe  that  it  is  the  superpowers,  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet 
Union,  who  are  to  blame  for  Korea's  national  division.  The  South 
Korean  government's  dependence  on  the  United  States  has  been 
cited  as  one  of  the  principal  reasons  for  the  lack  of  improvement 
in  north-south  ties.  While  a  majority  of  South  Koreans  remain  sus- 
picious of  the  North  Koreans,  many  South  Koreans  also  share  the 
sentiments  expressed  by  Kim  Chi-ha:  "Our  name  is  division,  and 
this  soiled  name,  like  an  immovable  destiny,  oppresses  all  of  us." 
When  parts  of  the  wall  dividing  East  Berlin  and  West  Berlin  were 
knocked  down  in  November  1989,  Koreans  reflected  sadly  that 
breaching  the  DMZ  would  not  be  such  a  simple  task. 

Korea  and  Japan 

National  or  ethnic  groups  often  need  an  "other,"  a  group  of 
outsiders  against  whom  they  can  define  themselves.  While  Western 
countries  with  their  individualistic  and,  from  a  Confucian  perspec- 
tive, self-centered  ways  of  life  provide  important  images  of  "other- 
ness" for  South  Koreans,  the  principal  source  of  such  images  for 
many  years  has  been  Japan.  Attitudes  toward  Japan  as  an  "other" 


109 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

are  complex.  On  the  most  basic  level,  there  is  hostility  fed  by 
memories  of  invasion  and  colonial  oppression,  present-day  economic 
frictions,  and  the  Japanese  government's  inability  or  unwilling- 
ness to  do  anything  about  discriminatory  treatment  of  the  large 
Korean  minority  in  Japan.  The  two  countries  have  a  long  history 
of  hostility.  Admiral  Yi  Sun-sin,  whose  armor-plated  boats  even- 
tually defeated  the  Japanese  navy's  damaging  attacks  in  the  1590s, 
is  South  Korea's  most  revered  national  hero. 

The  Japanese  Ministry  of  Education,  Science,  and  Culture's 
adoption  in  the  1980s  of  revised  textbook  guidelines,  softening  the 
language  used  to  describe  Japan's  aggression  during  World  War 
II,  inspired  outrage  in  South  Korea  as  well  as  in  other  Asian  coun- 
tries. The  textbook  controversy  was  a  major  impetus  for  a  nation- 
al campaign  to  build  an  Independence  Hall,  located  about  100 
kilometers  south  of  Seoul,  to  keep  alive  memories  of  Japanese 
colonial  exploitation.  Opened  on  August  15,  1987,  the  anniver- 
sary of  Korea's  liberation  from  Japan,  the  building  houses  grim 
exhibits  depicting  the  atrocities  of  the  Japanese  military  against 
Korean  nationalists  during  the  colonial  period. 

During  the  colonial  period,  and  particularly  during  World  War 
II,  the  Japanese  initiated  assimilation  policies  designed  to  turn 
Koreans  into  obedient  subjects  of  the  Japanese  emperor.  Under 
the  slogan  "Nissen  ittai"  (Japan  and  Korea  as  One),  newspapers 
and  magazines  published  in  the  Korean  language  were  closed,  the 
Korean  Language  Society  was  disbanded,  and  Korean  writers  were 
forced  to  publish  only  in  Japanese.  Students  who  spoke  Korean 
in  school  were  punished.  There  was  pressure  to  speak  Japanese 
at  home,  adopt  Japanese  family  and  given  names,  and  worship  at 
Shinto  shrines,  the  religious  basis  for  which  had  been  transplant- 
ed from  the  home  islands.  Korean  Christians  who  refused  to  show 
reverence  to  the  emperor  as  a  divinity  were  imprisoned  or  ostra- 
cized. In  the  words  of  historian  Ki-baik  Lee  (called  Yi  Ki-baek  in 
Korean),  ''Japan's  aim  was  to  eradicate  consciousness  of  Korean 
national  identity,  roots  and  all,  and  thus  to  obliterate  the  very  ex- 
istence of  the  Korean  people  from  the  face  of  the  earth." 

This  shared  historical  experience  has  provoked  not  only  hostili- 
ty but  also  a  desire  to  purge  Korean  culture  of  lingering  Japanese 
influences.  In  the  late  1980s,  the  government  continued  to  pro- 
hibit the  distribution  of  Japanese-made  movies  and  popular  mu- 
sic within  the  country  in  order  to  prevent  unwanted  contemporary 
influences  from  crossing  the  Korea  Strait. 

On  a  more  polite  level,  depiction  of  Japan  as  the  "other"  in- 
volves contrasting  the  "essences"  of  the  two  countries'  cultures. 
This  process  has  spawned  a  popular  literature  that  compares,  among 


110 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


other  things,  the  naturalness  and  "resonance"  of  Korean  art  and 
music  and  the  alleged  imitativeness  and  constriction  of  their 
Japanese  counterparts;  the  "individualism"  (of  a  non- Western  sort) 
of  Koreans  and  the  "collectivism"  or  group  consciousness  of  the 
Japanese;  and  the  lyric  contrast  between  the  rose  of  Sharon,  Korea's 
national  flower,  which  blooms  robustly  all  summer  long,  and  the 
Japanese  cherry  blossom,  which  has  the  "beauty  of  frailty"  in 
springtime. 

The  search  for  a  cultural  "essence"  involves  serious  contradic- 
tions. The  literature  of  Korean  cultural  distinction  is  strikingly  simi- 
lar to  Japanese  attempts  to  prove  the  "uniqueness"  of  their  own 
cultural  heritage,  although  "proof  of  Japan's  uniqueness  is  usually 
drawn  from  examples  of  Western  countries  (the  significant  "other" 
for  modernized  Japanese).  Ironically,  official  and  unofficial  spon- 
sorship of  the  Tan 'gun  myth,  although  a  minor  theme,  bears  an 
uncanny  resemblance  to  pre-World  War  II  Japanese  policies 
promoting  historical  interpretations  of  the  nation's  founding  based 
on  Shinto  mythology. 

Mixed  in  with  feelings  of  hostility  and  competition,  however, 
is  genuine  admiration  for  Japanese  economic,  technological,  and 
social  achievements.  Japan  has  become  an  important  market  for 
South  Korean  manufactured  products.  Both  countries  have  been 
targets  of  criticism  by  Western  governments  accusing  them  of  un- 
fair trading  practices.  Friendly  interest  in  South  Korea  is  growing 
among  the  Japanese  public  despite  old  prejudices,  and  large  num- 
bers of  young  Japanese  and  South  Koreans  visit  each  others'  coun- 
tries on  school  and  college  excursions.  Like  South  Koreans, 
Japanese  liberals  have  been  disturbed  by  official  attempts  to  re- 
vise wartime  history. 

The  Korean  Language 

Modern  Korean  language  is  descended  from  the  language  of  the 
Silla  Kingdom,  which  unified  the  peninsula  in  the  seventh  centu- 
ry. As  Korean  linguist  Yi  Ki-mun  notes,  the  more  remote  origins 
of  the  Korean  language  are  disputed,  although  many  Korean  lin- 
guists, together  with  a  few  western  scholars,  continue  to  favor  the 
now  widely-contested  nineteenth-century  theory  of  an  Altaic  fam- 
ily of  languages  supposed  to  include  Korean,  Japanese,  and  Mon- 
golian, among  other  languages.  Although  a  historical  relationship 
between  Korean  and  Japanese  has  not  been  established,  modern 
Korean  and  Japanese  have  many  similar  grammatical  features,  no 
doubt  in  part  because  of  close  contacts  between  the  two  during  the 
past  century.  These  similarities  have  given  rise  to  considerable 
speculation  in  the  popular  press.  The  linguist  Kim  Chin-wu,  for 


111 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

example,  has  hypothesized  that  Korea  and  Japan  stood  at  the  end 
of  two  routes  of  large-scale  migration  in  ancient  times:  a  northern 
route  from  Inner  Asia  and  a  southern  route  from  southern  China 
or  Southeast  Asia.  In  a  variant  on  the  "southern  origins"  theory 
of  some  Japanese  scholars,  he  views  the  two  languages  as  reflect- 
ing disparate  "northern' '  and  "southern"  influences,  with  Korean 
showing  more  influence  from  the  northern,  Inner  Asian  strain. 

Both  Korean  and  Japanese  possess  what  is  sometimes  called  "po- 
lite" or  "honorific"  language,  the  use  of  different  levels  of  speech 
in  addressing  persons  of  superior,  inferior,  or  equal  rank.  These 
distinctions  depend  both  on  the  use  of  different  vocabulary  and 
upon  basic  structural  differences  in  the  words  employed.  For  ex- 
ample, in  Korean  the  imperative  "go"  can  be  rendered  kara  when 
speaking  to  an  inferior  or  a  child,  kage  when  speaking  to  an  adult 
inferior,  kaseyo  when  speaking  to  a  superior,  and  kasipsio  when  speak- 
ing to  a  person  of  still  higher  rank.  The  proper  use  of  polite  lan- 
guage, or  levels  of  polite  speech,  is  an  extremely  complex  and  subde 
matter.  The  Korean  language,  like  Japanese,  is  extremely  sensi- 
tive to  the  nuances  of  hierarchical  human  relationships.  Two  per- 
sons who  meet  for  the  first  time  are  expected  to  use  the  more  distant 
or  formal  terms,  but  they  will  shift  to  more  informal  or  "equal" 
terms  if  they  become  friends.  Younger  people  invariably  use  for- 
mal language  in  addressing  elders;  the  latter  will  use  "inferior" 
terms  in  "talking  down"  to  those  who  are  younger. 

The  Korean  language  may  be  written  using  a  mixture  of  Chinese 
ideograms  (hancha)  and  a  native  Korean  alphabet  known  as  han  'gul, 
or  in  han  'gul  alone,  much  as  in  a  more  limited  way  Indo-European 
languages  sometimes  write  numbers  using  Arabic  symbols  and  at 
other  times  spell  numbers  out  in  their  own  alphabets  or  in  some 
combination  of  the  two  forms.  Han' gul  was  invented  by  scholars 
at  the  court  of  King  Sejong  (1418-50),  not  solely  to  promote  liter- 
acy among  the  common  people  as  is  sometimes  claimed,  but  also, 
as  Professor  Gari  K.  Ledyard  has  noted,  to  assist  in  studies  of 
Chinese  historical  phonology.  According  to  a  perhaps  apocryphal 
decree  of  the  king,  an  intelligent  man  could  learn  han  'gul  in  a  morn- 
ing's  time,  and  even  a  fool  could  master  it  in  ten  days.  As  a  result, 
it  was  scorned  by  scholars  and  relegated  to  women  and  merchants. 
The  script,  which  in  its  modern  form  contains  forty  symbols,  is 
considered  by  linguists  to  be  one  of  the  most  scientific  ever  devised; 
it  reflects  quite  consistently  the  phonemes  of  the  spoken  Korean 
language. 

Because  of  its  greater  variety  of  sounds,  Korean  does  not  have  the 
problem  of  the  Japanese  written  language,  which  some  experts  have 
argued  needs  to  retain  a  sizable  inventory  of  Chinese  characters 


112 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


to  distinguish  a  large  number  of  potentially  ambiguous  homo- 
phones. Since  1948  the  continued  use  of  Chinese  characters  in  South 
Korea  has  been  criticized  by  linguistic  nationalists  and  some  edu- 
cators and  defended  by  cultural  conservatives,  who  fear  that  the 
loss  of  character  literacy  could  cut  younger  generations  off  from 
a  major  part  of  their  cultural  heritage.  Since  the  early  1970s,  Seoul's 
policy  governing  the  teaching  and  use  of  Chinese  characters  has 
shifted  several  times,  although  the  trend  clearly  has  been  toward 
writing  in  han'gul  alone.  By  early  1990,  all  but  academic  writing 
used  far  fewer  Chinese  characters  than  was  the  case  in  the  1960s. 
In  1989  the  Korean  Language  and  Education  Research  Associa- 
tion, citing  the  need  for  Chinese  character  literacy  "at  a  time  when 
the  nation  is  entering  into  keen  competition  with  Japan  and  China" 
and  noting  that  Japanese  educators  were  increasing  the  number 
of  Chinese  characters  taught  in  elementary  schools,  recommended 
to  the  Ministry  of  Education  that  instruction  in  Chinese  charac- 
ters be  reintroduced  at  the  primary- school  level. 

Although  the  Korean  and  Chinese  languages  are  not  related  in 
terms  of  grammatical  structure,  more  than  50  percent  of  all  Korean 
vocabulary  is  derived  from  Chinese  loanwords,  a  reflection  of  the 
cultural  dominance  of  China  over  2  millennia.  In  many  cases  there 
are  two  words — a  Chinese  loanword  and  an  indigenous  Korean 
word — meaning  the  same  thing.  The  Chinese-based  word  in 
Korean  sometimes  has  a  bookish  or  formal  flavor.  Koreans  select 
one  or  the  other  variant  to  achieve  the  proper  register  in  speech, 
or  in  writing,  and  to  make  subtle  distinctions  of  meaning  in  accor- 
dance with  established  usage. 

Large  numbers  of  Chinese  character  compounds  coined  in  Japan 
in  the  nineteenth  or  twentieth  centuries  to  translate  modern  Western 
scientific,  technical,  and  political  vocabulary  came  into  use  in  Korea 
during  the  colonial  period.  Post- 1945  United  States  influence  has 
been  reflected  in  a  number  of  English  words  that  have  been  ab- 
sorbed into  Korean. 

Unlike  Chinese,  Korean  does  not  encompass  dialects  that  are 
mutually  unintelligible,  with  the  possible  exception  of  the  variant 
spoken  on  Cheju  Island.  There  are,  however,  regional  variations 
both  in  vocabulary  and  pronunciation,  the  range  being  compara- 
ble to  the  differences  that  might  be  found  between  Maine  and  Ala- 
bama in  the  United  States.  Despite  several  decades  of  universal 
education,  similar  variations  also  have  been  heard  between  highly 
educated  and  professional  speakers  and  Koreans  of  working  class 
or  rural  backgrounds.  Standard  Korean  is  derived  from  the  language 
spoken  in  and  around  Seoul.  More  than  forty  years  of  division  has 


113 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

meant  that  there  are  also  some  divergences  in  the  development  of 
the  Korean  language  north  and  south  of  the  DMZ. 

Education 

Like  other  East  Asian  countries  with  a  Confucian  heritage,  South 
Korea  has  had  a  long  history  of  providing  formal  education. 
Although  there  was  no  state- supported  system  of  primary  educa- 
tion, the  central  government  established  a  system  of  secondary 
schools  in  Seoul  and  the  provinces  during  the  Choson  Dynasty. 
State  schools  suffered  a  decline  in  quality,  however,  and  came  to 
be  supplanted  in  importance  by  the  sowon,  private  academies  that 
were  the  centers  of  a  neo-Confucian  revival  in  the  sixteenth  cen- 
tury. Students  at  both  private  and  state-supported  secondary  schools 
were  exempt  from  military  service  and  had  much  the  same  social 
prestige  as  university  students  enjoy  today  in  South  Korea.  Like 
modern  students,  they  were  frequently  involved  in  politics.  Higher 
education  was  provided  by  the  Confucian  national  university  in 
the  capital,  the  Songgyungwan.  Its  enrollment  was  limited  to  200 
students  who  had  passed  the  lower  civil  service  examinations  and 
were  preparing  for  the  higher  examinations. 

During  the  late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries,  modern 
private  schools  were  established  both  by  Koreans  and  by  foreign 
Christian  missionaries.  The  latter  were  particularly  important  be- 
cause they  promoted  the  education  of  women  and  the  diffusion  of 
Western  social  and  political  ideas.  Japanese  educational  policy  af- 
ter 1910  was  designed  to  turn  Koreans  into  obedient  colonial  sub- 
jects and  to  teach  them  limited  technical  skills.  A  state  university 
modeled  on  Tokyo  Imperial  University  was  established  in  Seoul 
in  1923,  but  the  number  of  Koreans  allowed  to  study  there  never 
exceeded  40  percent  of  its  enrollment;  60  percent  of  its  students 
were  Japanese  expatriates. 

When  United  States  military  forces  occupied  the  southern  half 
of  the  Korean  Peninsula  in  1 945 ,  they  established  a  school  system 
based  on  the  American  model:  six  years  of  primary  school,  six  years 
of  secondary  school  (divided  into  junior  and  senior  levels),  and  four 
years  of  higher  education.  Other  occupation  period  reforms  included 
coeducation  at  all  levels,  popularly  elected  school  boards  in  local 
areas,  and  compulsory  education  up  to  the  ninth  grade.  The  govern- 
ment of  Syngman  Rhee  reversed  many  of  these  reforms  after  1948: 
in  most  cases  only  primary  schools  remained  coeducational  and 
education  was  compulsory  only  up  to  the  sixth  grade  because  of 
a  lack  of  resources.  The  school  system  in  1990,  however,  reflects 
the  system  established  under  the  United  States  occupation. 


114 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


During  the  years  when  Rhee  and  Park  Chung  Hee  were  in  pow- 
er, the  control  of  education  was  gradually  taken  out  of  the  hands 
of  local  school  boards  and  concentrated  in  a  centralized  Ministry 
of  Education.  In  the  late  1980s,  the  ministry  was  responsible  for 
administration  of  schools,  allocation  of  resources,  setting  of  enroll- 
ment quotas,  certification  of  schools  and  teachers,  curriculum  de- 
velopment (including  the  issuance  of  textbook  guidelines),  and  other 
basic  policy  decisions.  Provincial  and  special  city  boards  of  educa- 
tion still  existed.  Although  each  board  was  composed  of  seven  mem- 
bers who  were  supposed  to  be  selected  by  popularly  elected 
legislative  bodies,  this  arrangement  ceased  to  function  after  1973. 
Subsequently,  school  board  members  were  approved  by  the  minister 
of  education. 

Most  observers  agree  that  South  Korea's  spectacular  progress 
in  modernization  and  economic  growth  since  the  Korean  War  is 
largely  attributable  to  the  willingness  of  individuals  to  invest  a  large 
amount  of  resources  in  education:  the  improvement  of  "human 
capital."  The  traditional  esteem  for  the  educated  man,  originally 
confined  to  the  Confucian  scholar  as  a  cultured  generalist,  now 
extends  to  scientists,  technicians,  and  others  working  with  special- 
ized knowledge.  Highly  educated  technocrats  and  economic  plan- 
ners could  claim  much  of  the  credit  for  their  country's  economic 
successes  since  the  1960s.  Scientific  professions  were  generally 
regarded  as  the  most  prestigious  by  South  Koreans  in  the  1980s. 

Statistics  demonstrate  the  success  of  South  Korea's  national  edu- 
cation programs.  In  1945  the  adult  literacy  rate  was  estimated  at 
22  percent;  by  1970  adult  literacy  was  87.6  percent,  and  by  the 
late  1980s  various  sources  estimated  it  at  around  93  percent.  South 
Korean  students  have  performed  exceedingly  well  in  internation- 
al competitions  in  mathematics  and  science.  Although  only  primary 
school  (grades  one  through  six)  was  compulsory,  percentages  of 
age-groups  of  children  and  young  people  enrolled  in  primary,  second- 
ary, and  tertiary  level  schools  were  equivalent  to  those  found  in 
industrialized  countries,  including  Japan.  Approximately  4.8  mil- 
lion students  in  the  eligible  age-group  were  attending  primary  school 
in  1985.  The  percentage  of  students  going  on  to  optional  middle 
school  the  same  year  was  more  than  99  percent.  Approximately 
34  percent,  one  of  the  world's  highest  rates  of  secondary- school 
graduates,  attended  institutions  of  higher  education  in  1987,  a  rate 
similar  to  Japan's  (about  30  percent)  and  exceeding  Britain's  (20 
percent). 

Government  expenditure  on  education  has  been  generous.  In 
1975  it  was  W220  billion  (for  value  of  the  won — see  Glossary),  the 
equivalent  of  2.2  percent  of  the  gross  national  product  (GNP — see 


115 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

Glossary),  or  13.9  percent  of  total  government  expenditures.  By 
1986  education  expenditure  had  reached  won  3.76  trillion,  or  4.5 
percent  of  the  GNP,  and  27.3  percent  of  government  budget 
allocations. 

Social  emphasis  on  education  was  not,  however,  without  its 
problems,  as  it  tended  to  accentuate  class  differences.  In  the  late 
1980s,  possession  of  a  college  degree  was  considered  necessary  for 
entering  the  middle  class;  there  were  no  alternative  pathways  of 
social  advancement,  with  the  possible  exception  of  a  military  career. 
People  without  a  college  education,  including  skilled  workers  with 
vocational  school  backgrounds,  often  were  treated  as  second-class 
citizens  by  their  white-collar,  college-educated  managers,  despite 
the  importance  of  their  skills  for  economic  development.  Intense 
competition  for  places  at  the  most  prestigious  universities — the  sole 
gateway  into  elite  circles — promoted,  like  the  old  Confucian  sys- 
tem, a  sterile  emphasis  on  rote  memorization  in  order  to  pass  sec- 
ondary school  and  college  entrance  examinations.  Particularly  after 
a  dramatic  expansion  of  college  enrollments  in  the  early  1980s, 
South  Korea  faced  the  problem  of  what  to  do  about  a  large  num- 
ber of  young  people  kept  in  school  for  a  long  time,  usually  at  great 
sacrifice  to  themselves  and  their  families,  and  then  faced  with  limited 
job  opportunities  because  their  skills  were  not  marketable. 

Primary  and  Secondary  Schools 

In  the  late  1980s,  primary  schools  were  coeducational,  although 
coeducation  was  quite  rare  at  the  middle-school  and  high-school 
levels.  Enrollment  figures  for  1987  on  the  primary- school  level  were 
4,771,722  pupils  in  6,531  schools,  with  130,142  teachers.  A  decline 
from  the  1980  figure  of  5,658,002  pupils  was  caused  by  popula- 
tion trends.  Some  54  percent  of  primary  school  teachers  were  male. 

In  1987  there  were  approximately  4,895,354  students  enrolled 
in  middle  schools  and  high  schools,  with  approximately  150,873 
teachers.  About  69  percent  of  these  teachers  were  male.  The 
secondary- school  enrollment  figure  also  reflected  changing  popu- 
lation trends;  there  were  3,959,975  students  in  secondary  schools 
in  1979.  Given  the  importance  of  entry  into  higher  education,  the 
majority  of  students  attended  general  or  academic  high  schools  in 
1987:  1 ,397,359  students,  or  60  percent  of  the  total,  attended  general 
or  academic  high  schools,  as  compared  with  840,265  students  in 
vocational  secondary  schools.  Vocational  schools  specialized  in  a 
number  of  fields:  primarily  agriculture,  fishery,  commerce,  trades, 
merchant  marine,  engineering,  and  the  arts. 

Enrollment  in  kindergartens  or  preschools  expanded  impressively 
during  the  1980s.  In  1980  there  were  66,433  children  attending 


116 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


901  kindergartens  or  preschools.  By  1987  there  were  397,020  chil- 
dren in  7,792  institutions.  The  number  of  kindergarten  and 
preschool  teachers  rose  from  3,339  to  1 1 ,920  during  the  same  peri- 
od. The  overwhelming  majority  of  these  teachers — approximately 
92  percent — were  women.  This  growth  was  attributable  to  several 
factors:  Ministry  of  Education  encouragement  of  preschool  edu- 
cation, the  greater  number  of  women  entering  the  work  force, 
growth  in  the  number  of  nuclear  families  without  a  grandparent 
available  to  take  care  of  children,  and  the  feeling  that  kindergar- 
ten might  give  children  an  4 'edge"  in  later  educational  competi- 
tion. Kindergartens  often  paid  homage  to  the  expectations  of  parents 
with  impressive  graduation  ceremonies,  complete  with  diplomas, 
academic  caps,  and  gowns. 

Competitive  entrance  examinations  at  the  middle-school  level 
were  abolished  in  1968.  Although  as  of  the  late  1980s,  students 
still  had  to  pass  noncompetitive  qualifying  examinations,  they  were 
assigned  to  secondary  institutions  by  lottery,  or  else  by  location 
within  the  boundary  of  the  school  district.  Secondary  schools,  for- 
merly ranked  according  to  the  quality  of  their  students,  have  been 
equalized,  with  a  portion  of  good,  mediocre,  and  poor  students 
being  assigned  to  each  one.  The  reform,  however,  did  not  equal- 
ize secondary  schools  completely.  In  Seoul,  students  who  performed 
well  in  qualifying  examinations  were  allowed  to  attend  better  quality 
schools  in  a  "common"  district,  whereas  other  students  attended 
schools  in  one  of  five  geographical  districts.  The  reforms  applied 
equally  to  public  and  private  schools,  both  of  whose  enrollments 
were  strictly  controlled  by  the  Ministry  of  Education. 

Although  primary-  and  secondary- school  teachers  traditionally 
enjoyed  high  status,  they  often  were  overworked  and  underpaid 
during  the  late  1980s.  Salaries  were  less  than  those  for  many  other 
white-collar  professions  and  even  some  blue-collar  jobs.  High  school 
teachers,  particularly  those  in  the  cities,  did  however,  receive  siz- 
able gifts  from  parents  seeking  attention  for  their  children,  but  teach- 
ing hours  were  long  and  classes  crowded  (the  average  class  contained 
around  fifty  to  sixty  students). 

In  May  1989,  teachers  established  an  independent  union,  the 
National  Teachers  Union  (NTU — Chon'gyojo).  Their  aims  includ- 
ed improving  working  conditions  and  reforming  a  school  system 
that  they  regarded  as  overly  controlled  by  the  Ministry  of  Educa- 
tion. Although  the  government  promised  large  increases  in  allo- 
cations for  teachers'  salaries  and  facilities,  it  refused  to  give  the 
union  legal  status.  Because  teachers  were  civil  servants,  the  govern- 
ment claimed  they  did  not  have  the  right  to  strike  and,  even  if  they 
did  have  the  right  to  strike,  unionization  would  undermine  the  status 


117

of  teachers  as  "role  models"  for  young  Koreans.  The  government 
also  accused  the  union  of  spreading  subversive,  leftist  propaganda 
that  was  sympathetic  to  the  communist  regime  in  North  Korea. 

According  to  a  report  in  the  Asian  Wall  Street  Journal,  the  union 
claimed  support  from  82  percent  of  all  teachers.  The  controversy 
was  viewed  as  representing  a  major  crisis  for  South  Korean  edu- 
cation because  a  large  number  of  teachers  (1,500  by  November 
1989)  had  been  dismissed;  violence  among  union  supporters,  op- 
ponents, and  police  had  occurred  at  several  locations;  and  class 
disruptions  had  caused  anxieties  for  families  of  students  preparing 
for  the  college  entrance  examinations.  The  union's  challenge  to 
the  Ministry  of  Education's  control  of  the  system  and  the  charges 
of  subversion  had  made  compromise  seem  a  very  remote  possibil- 
ity at  the  start  of  1990. 

Higher  Education 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  university  a  South  Korean  high  school 
graduate  attended  was  perhaps  the  single  most  important  factor 
in  determining  his  or  her  life  chances.  Thus,  entrance  into  a  pres- 
tigious institution  was  the  focus  of  intense  energy,  dedication,  and 
self-sacrifice.  Prestigious  institutions  included  the  state-run  Seoul 
National  University,  originally  established  by  the  Japanese  as  Seoul 
Imperial  University  in  1923,  and  a  handful  of  private  institutions 
such  as  Yonse  University,  Koryo  University,  and  Ehwa  Woman's 
University. 

Because  college  entrance  depends  upon  ranking  high  in  objec- 
tively graded  examinations,  high  school  students  face  an  "exami- 
nation hell,"  a  harsh  regimen  of  endless  cramming  and  rote 
memorization  of  facts  that  is  probably  even  more  severe  than  the 
one  faced  by  their  counterparts  in  Japan.  Unlike  the  Confucian 
civil  service  examinations  of  the  C  ho  son  Dynasty,  their  modern 
reincarnation  is  a  matter  of  importance  not  for  an  elite,  but  for 
the  substantial  portion  of  the  population  with  middle-class  aspira- 
tions. In  the  late  1980s,  over  one-third  of  college-age  men  and  wom- 
en (35.2  percent  in  1989)  succeeded  in  entering  and  attending 
institutions  of  higher  education;  those  who  failed  faced  dramati- 
cally reduced  prospects  for  social  and  economic  advancement. 

The  number  of  students  in  higher  education  had  risen  from 
100,000  in  1960  to  1 .3  million  in  1987,  and  the  proportion  of  college- 
age  students  in  higher-education  institutions  was  second  only  to 
the  United  States.  The  institutions  of  higher  education  included 
regular  four-year  colleges  and  universities,  two-year  junior  voca- 
tional colleges,  four-year  teachers'  colleges,  and  graduate  schools. 
The  main  drawback  was  that  college  graduates  wanted  careers  that

would  bring  them  positions  of  leadership  in  society,  but  there  sim- 
ply were  not  enough  positions  to  accommodate  all  graduates  each 
year  and  many  graduates  were  forced  to  accept  lesser  positions. 
Ambitious  women,  especially,  were  frustrated  by  traditional  bar- 
riers of  sex  discrimination  as  well  as  by  the  lack  of  positions. 

A  college-bound  high  school  student,  in  the  late  1980s,  typical- 
ly rose  at  dawn,  did  a  bit  of  studying  before  school  began  at  7:30 
or  8:00  A.M.,  attended  school  until  5:00  P.M.,  had  a  quick  dinner 
(often  away  from  home),  and  then  attended  evening  cramming 
classes  that  could  last  until  10:00  or  11:00  P.M.  Sundays  and  holi- 
days were  devoted  to  more  cramming.  Because  tests  given  in  high 
school  (generally  once  every  two  or  four  weeks)  were  almost  as  im- 
portant in  determining  college  entrance  as  the  final  entrance  ex- 
aminations, students  had  no  opportunity  to  relax  from  the  study 
routine.  According  to  one  contemporary  account,  a  student  had 
to  memorize  60  to  100  pages  of  facts  to  do  well  on  these  periodic 
tests.  Family  and  social  life  generally  were  sacrificed  to  the  supreme 
end  of  getting  into  the  best  university  possible. 

The  costs  of  the  '  'examination  hell"  have  been  evident  not  only 
in  a  grim  and  joyless  adolescence  for  many,  if  not  most,  young 
South  Koreans,  but  also  in  the  number  of  suicides  caused  by  the 
constant  pressure  of  tests.  Often  suicides  have  been  top  achievers 


119

who  despaired  after  experiencing  a  slump  in  test  performance.  In 
addition,  the  multiple  choice  format  of  periodic  high  school  tests 
and  university  entrance  examinations  has  left  students  little  oppor- 
tunity to  develop  their  creative  talents.  A  "facts  only"  orientation 
has  promoted  a  cramped  and  unspontaneous  view  of  the  world  that 
has  tended  to  spill  over  into  areas  of  life  other  than  academic  work. 

The  prospects  for  basic  change  in  the  system — a  deemphasis  on 
tests — were  unlikely  in  the  late  1980s.  The  great  virtue  of  facts- 
based  testing  is  its  objectivity.  Although  harsh,  the  system  is  believed 
to  be  fair  and  impartial.  The  use  of  nonobjective  criteria  such  as 
essays,  personal  recommendations,  and  the  recognition  of  success 
in  extracurricular  activities  or  personal  recommendations  from 
teachers  and  others  could  open  up  all  sorts  of  opportunities  for  cor- 
ruption. In  a  society  where  social  connections  are  extremely  impor- 
tant, connections  rather  than  merit  might  determine  entry  into  a 
good  university.  Students  who  survive  the  numbing  regimen  of 
examinations  under  the  modern  system  are  at  least  universally 
acknowledged  to  have  deserved  their  educational  success.  Top 
graduates  who  have  assumed  positions  of  responsibility  in  govern- 
ment and  business  have  lent,  through  their  talents,  legitimacy  to 
the  whole  system. 

Following  the  assumption  of  power  by  General  Chun  Doo  Hwan 
in  1980,  the  Ministry  of  Education  implemented  a  number  of  re- 
forms designed  to  make  the  system  fairer  and  to  increase  higher 
education  opportunities  for  the  population  at  large.  In  a  very  popu- 
lar move,  the  ministry  dramatically  increased  enrollment  at  large. 
The  number  of  high  school  graduates  accepted  into  colleges  and 
universities  was  increased  from  almost  403,000  students  in  1980 
to  more  than  1.4  million  in  1989.  This  reform  decreased,  temporar- 
ily, the  acceptance  ratio  from  one  college  place  for  every  four  ap- 
plicants in  1980  to  one  for  every  three  applicants  in  1981 .  In  1980 
the  number  of  students  attending  all  kinds  of  higher  educational 
institutions  was  almost  600,000;  that  number  grew  almost  100  per- 
cent to  1,061,403  students  by  1983.  By  1987  there  were  1,340,381 
students  attending  higher  educational  institutions.  By  1987  junior 
colleges  had  an  enrollment  of  almost  260,000  students,  and  col- 
leges and  universities  had  an  enrollment  of  almost  990,000  students. 
Other  higher  education  institutions  enrolled  the  balance. 

A  second  reform  was  the  prohibition  of  private,  after-school  tutor- 
ing. Formerly,  private  tutors  could  charge  exorbitant  rates  if  they 
had  a  good  "track  record"  of  getting  students  into  the  right  schools 
through  intensive  coaching,  especially  in  English  and  in  mathemat- 
ics. This  situation  gave  wealthy  families  an  unfair  advantage  in 
the  competition.  Under  the  new  rules,  students  receiving  tutoring 


120 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


could  be  suspended  from  school  and  their  tutors  dismissed  from 
their  jobs.  There  was  ample  evidence  in  the  mid-1980s,  however, 
that  the  law  had  simply  driven  the  private  tutoring  system  under- 
ground and  made  the  fees  more  expensive.  Some  underpaid  teachers 
and  cash-starved  students  at  prestigious  institutions  were  willing 
to  run  the  risk  of  punishment  in  order  to  earn  as  much  as  W300,000 
to  W500,000  a  month.  Students  and  their  parents  took  the  risk 
of  being  caught,  believing  that  coaching  in  weak  subject  areas  could 
give  students  the  edge  needed  to  get  into  a  better  university.  By 
the  late  1980s,  however,  the  tutorial  system  seemed  largely  to  have 
disappeared. 

A  third  reform  was  much  less  popular.  The  ministry  established 
a  graduation  quota  system,  in  which  increased  freshman  enroll- 
ments were  counterbalanced  by  the  requirement  that  each  four- 
year  college  or  university  fail  the  lowest  30  percent  of  its  students; 
junior  colleges  were  required  to  fail  the  lowest  15  percent.  These 
quotas  were  required  no  matter  how  well  the  lowest  30  or  15  per- 
cent of  the  students  did  in  terms  of  objective  standards.  Ostensi- 
bly designed  to  ensure  the  quality  of  the  increased  number  of  college 
graduates,  the  system  also  served,  for  a  while  to  discourage  stu- 
dents from  devoting  their  time  to  political  movements.  Resentment 
of  the  quotas  was  widespread,  and  family  counterpressures  were 
intense.  The  government  abolished  the  quotas  in  1984. 

College  Student  Activism 

Student  activism  has  a  long  and  honorable  history  in  Korea.  Stu- 
dents in  Choson  Dynasty  secondary  schools  often  became  involved 
in  the  intense  factional  struggles  of  the  scholar-official  class.  Stu- 
dents played  a  major  role  in  Korea's  independence  movement,  par- 
ticularly the  March  1 ,  1919,  country- wide  demonstrations  that  were 
harshly  suppressed  by  the  Japanese  military  police.  Students  pro- 
tested against  the  Rhee  and  Park  regimes  during  the  1950s,  1960s, 
and  1970s.  Observers  noted,  however,  that  while  student  activists 
in  the  past  generally  embraced  liberal  and  democratic  values,  the 
new  generation  of  militants  in  the  1980s  was  far  more  radical.  Most 
participants  have  adopted  some  version  of  the  minjung  ideology  that 
was  heavily  influenced  by  Marxism,  Western  "dependence  the- 
ory," and  Christian  "liberation  theology,"  but  was  also  animat- 
ed by  strong  feelings  of  popular  nationalism  and  xenophobia. 

The  most  militant  university  students,  perhaps  about  5  percent 
of  the  total  enrollment  at  Seoul  National  University  and  compara- 
ble numbers  at  other  institutions  in  the  capital  during  the  late  1980s, 
were  organized  into  small  circles  or  cells  rarely  containing  more 
than  fifty  members.  Police  estimated  that  there  were  seventy-two 


121

such  organizations  of  varying  orientation  (see  Political  Extremism 
and  Political  Violence,  ch.  4). 

Religion 

Religious  Traditions 

Shamanism 

Koreans,  like  other  East  Asians,  have  traditionally  been  eclec- 
tic rather  than  exclusive  in  their  religious  commitments.  Their  re- 
ligious outlook  has  not  been  conditioned  by  a  single,  exclusive  faith 
but  by  a  combination  of  indigenous  beliefs  and  creeds  imported 
into  Korea.  Belief  in  a  world  inhabited  by  spirits  is  probably  the 
oldest  form  of  Korean  religious  life,  dating  back  to  prehistoric  times. 
There  is  a  rather  unorganized  pantheon  of  literally  millions  of  gods, 
spirits,  and  ghosts,  ranging  from  the  "god  generals"  who  rule  the 
different  quarters  of  heaven  to  mountain  spirits  (sansiri).  This  pan- 
theon also  includes  gods  who  inhabit  trees,  sacred  caves,  and  piles 
of  stones,  as  well  as  earth  spirits,  the  tutelary  gods  of  households 
and  villages,  mischievous  goblins,  and  the  ghosts  of  persons  who 
in  many  cases  met  violent  or  tragic  ends.  These  spirits  are  said 
to  have  the  power  to  influence  or  to  change  the  fortunes  of  living 
men  and  women. 

Korean  shamans  are  similar  in  many  ways  to  those  found  in 
Siberia,  Mongolia,  and  Manchuria.  They  also  resemble  the  yuta 
found  on  the  Ryukyu  Islands,  in  Okinawa  Prefecture,  Japan.  Cheju 
Island  is  also  a  center  of  shamanism. 

Shamans,  most  of  whom  are  women,  are  enlisted  by  those  who 
want  the  help  of  the  spirit  world.  Female  shamans  hold  hut,  or  ser- 
vices, in  order  to  gain  good  fortune  for  clients,  cure  illnesses  by 
exorcising  evil  spirits,  or  propitiate  local  or  village  gods.  Such  ser- 
vices are  also  held  to  guide  the  spirit  of  a  deceased  person  to  heaven. 

Often  a  woman  will  become  a  shaman  very  reluctantly — after 
experiencing  a  severe  physical  or  mental  illness  that  indicates  "pos- 
session" by  a  spirit.  Such  possession  allegedly  can  be  cured  only 
through  performance  of  a  hut.  Once  a  shaman  is  established  in  her 
profession,  she  usually  can  make  a  good  living. 

Many  scholars  regard  Korean  shamanism  as  less  a  religion  than 
a  "medicine"  in  which  the  spirits  are  manipulated  in  order  to 
achieve  human  ends.  There  is  no  notion  of  salvation  or  moral  and 
spiritual  perfection,  at  least  for  the  ordinary  believers  in  spirits. 
The  shaman  is  a  professional  who  is  consulted  by  clients  whenever 
the  need  is  felt.  Traditionally,  shamans  had  low  social  status  and 
were  members  of  the  ch'dmmin  class.  This  discrimination  has  con- 
tinued into  modern  times. 


122 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Animistic  beliefs  are  strongly  associated  with  the  culture  of  fish- 
ing villages  and  are  primarily  a  phenomenon  found  in  rural  com- 
munities. Shamans  also  treat  the  ills  of  city  people,  however, 
especially  recent  migrants  from  the  countryside  who  find  adjust- 
ment to  an  impersonal  urban  life  stressful.  The  government  has 
discouraged  belief  in  shamanism  as  superstition  and  for  many  years 
minimized  its  persistence  in  Korean  life.  Yet  in  a  climate  of  grow- 
ing nationalism  and  cultural  self-confidence,  the  dances,  songs,  and 
incantations  that  compose  the  hut  have  come  to  be  recognized  as 
an  important  aspect  of  Korean  culture.  Beginning  in  the  1970s, 
rituals  that  formerly  had  been  kept  out  of  foreign  view  began  to 
resurface,  and  occasionally  a  Western  hotel  manager  or  other  execu- 
tive could  even  be  seen  attending  a  shamanistic  exorcism  ritual  in 
the  course  of  opening  a  new  branch  in  Seoul.  Some  of  these  aspects 
of  hut  have  been  designated  valuable  cultural  properties  that  should 
be  preserved  and  passed  on  to  future  generations. 

The  future  of  shamanism  itself  was  uncertain  in  the  late  1980s. 
Observers  believed  that  many  of  its  functions  in  the  future  proba- 
bly will  be  performed  by  the  psychiatric  profession  as  the  govern- 
ment expands  mental  health  treatment  facilities.  Given  the 
uncertainty  of  social,  economic,  and  political  conditions,  however, 
it  appears  certain  that  shamans  will  find  large  numbers  of  clients 
for  some  time  to  come. 

Taoism  and  Buddhism 

Taoism,  which  focuses  on  the  individual  in  nature  rather  than 
the  individual  in  society,  and  Buddhism  entered  Korea  from  Chi- 
na during  the  Three  Kingdoms  period  (fourth  to  seventh  centu- 
ries A.D.).  Taoist  motifs  are  seen  in  the  paintings  on  the  walls  of 
Koguryo  tombs.  Buddhism  was  the  dominant  religious  and  cul- 
tural influence  during  the  Silla  (A.D.  668-935)  and  Koryo 
(918-1392)  dynasties.  Confucianism  also  was  brought  to  Korea  from 
China  in  early  centuries,  but  it  occupied  a  subordinate  position 
until  the  establishment  of  the  Choson  Dynasty  and  the  persecu- 
tion of  Buddhism  carried  out  by  the  early  Choson  Dynasty  kings 
(see  Social  Structures  and  Values,  this  ch.). 

Christianity 

Roman  Catholic  missionaries  did  not  arrive  in  Korea  until  1794, 
a  decade  after  the  return  of  the  first  baptized  Korean  from  a  visit 
to  Beijing.  However,  the  writings  of  the  Jesuit  missionary,  Mat- 
teo  Ricci,  who  was  resident  at  the  imperial  court  in  Beijing,  had 
been  brought  to  Korea  from  China  in  the  seventeenth  century.  It 
appears  that  scholars  of  the  Sirhak,  or  practical  learning,  school 


123 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

were  interested  in  these  writings.  Largely  because  converts  refused 
to  perform  Confucian  ancestor  rites,  the  government  prohibited 
the  proselytization  of  Christianity.  Some  Catholics  were  executed 
during  the  early  nineteenth  century,  but  the  anti-Christian  law  was 
not  stricdy  enforced.  By  the  1860s,  there  were  some  17,500  Roman 
Catholics  in  the  country.  There  followed  a  more  rigorous  persecu- 
tion, in  which  thousands  of  Christians  died,  that  continued  until 
1884. 

Protestant  missionaries  entered  Korea  during  the  1880s  and, 
along  with  Catholic  priests,  converted  a  remarkable  number  of 
Koreans.  Methodist  and  Presbyterian  missionaries  were  especially 
successful.  They  established  schools,  universities,  hospitals,  and 
orphanages  and  played  a  significant  role  in  the  modernization  of 
the  country.  During  the  Japanese  colonial  occupation,  Christians 
were  in  the  front  ranks  of  the  struggle  for  independence.  Factors 
contributing  to  the  growth  of  Protestantism  included  the  degener- 
ate state  of  Korean  Buddhism,  the  efforts  made  by  educated  Chris- 
tians to  reconcile  Christian  and  Confucian  values  (the  latter  being 
viewed  as  purely  a  social  ethic  rather  than  a  religion),  the  encourage- 
ment of  self-support  and  self-government  among  members  of  the 
Korean  church,  and  the  identification  of  Christianity  with  Korean 
nationalism. 

A  large  number  of  Christians  lived  in  the  northern  part  of  the 
peninsula  where  Confucian  influence  was  not  as  strong  as  in  the 
south.  Before  1948  P'yongyang  was  an  important  Christian  center: 
one-sixth  of  its  population  of  about  300,000  people  were  converts. 
Following  the  establishment  of  a  communist  regime  in  the  north, 
however,  most  Christians  had  to  flee  to  South  Korea  or  face  perse- 
cution. 

New  Religions 

Ch'ondogyo,  generally  regarded  as  the  first  of  Korea's  "new 
religions,"  is  another  important  religious  tradition.  It  is  a  synthe- 
sis of  Confucian,  Buddhist,  shamanistic,  Taoist,  and  Catholic  in- 
fluences. Ch'ondogyo  grew  out  of  the  Tonghak  Movement  (also 
called  Eastern  Learning  Movement)  established  by  Ch'oe  Che-u, 
a  man  of  yangban  background  who  claimed  to  have  experienced  a 
mystic  encounter  with  God,  who  told  him  to  preach  to  all  the  world. 
Ch'oe  was  executed  by  the  government  as  a  heretic  in  1863,  but 
not  before  he  had  acquired  a  number  of  followers  and  had  com- 
mitted his  ideas  to  writing.  Tonghak  spread  among  the  poor  peo- 
ple of  Korea's  villages,  especially  in  the  Cholla  region,  and  was 
the  cause  of  a  revolt  against  the  royal  government  in  1894.  While 
some  members  of  the  Tonghak  Movement — renamed  Ch'ondogyo

(Teachings  of  the  Heavenly  Way) — supported  the  Japanese  annex- 
ation in  1910,  others  opposed  it.  This  group  played  a  major  role, 
along  with  Christians  and  some  Confucians,  in  the  Korean  nation- 
alist movement.  In  the  1920s,  Ch'ondogyo  sponsored  Kaebyok  (Cre- 
ation), one  of  Korea's  major  intellectual  journals  during  the  colonial 
period  (see  The  Media,  ch.  4). 

Ch'ondogyo' s  basic  beliefs  include  the  essential  equality  of  all 
human  beings.  Each  person  must  be  treated  with  respect  because 
all  persons  "contain  divinity;"  there  is  "God  in  man."  Moreover, 
men  and  women  must  sincerely  cultivate  themselves  in  order  to 
bring  forth  and  express  this  divinity  in  their  lives.  Self-perfection, 
not  ritual  and  ceremony,  is  the  way  to  salvation.  Although  Ch'oe 
and  his  followers  did  not  attempt  to  overthrow  the  social  order  and 
establish  a  radical  egalitarianism,  the  revolutionary  potential  of 
Ch'ondogyo  is  evident  in  these  basic  ideas,  which  appealed  espe- 
cially to  poor  people  who  were  told  that  they,  along  with  scholars 
and  high  officials,  could  achieve  salvation  through  effort.  There 
is  reason  to  believe  that  Ch'ondogyo  had  an  important  role  in  the 
development  of  democratic  and  anti-authoritarian  thought  in  Korea. 
In  the  1970s  and  1980s,  Ch'ondogyo' s  antecedent,  the  Tonghak 
Movement,  received  renewed  interest  among  many  Korean  in- 
tellectuals. 

Apart  from  Ch'ondogyo,  major  new  religions  included  Taejong- 
gyo,  which  has  as  its  central  creed  the  worship  of  Tan' gun,  legend- 
ary founder  of  the  Korean  nation.  Chungsanggyo,  founded  in  the 
early  twentieth  century,  emphasizes  magical  practices  and  the  cre- 
ation of  a  paradise  on  earth.  It  is  divided  into  a  great  number  of 
competing  branches.  Wonbulgyo,  or  Won  Buddhism,  attempts  to 
combine  traditional  Buddhist  doctrine  with  a  modern  concern  for 
social  reform  and  revitalization.  There  are  also  a  number  of  small 
sects  which  have  sprung  up  around  Mount  Kyeryong  in  South 
Ch'ungch'ong  Province,  the  supposed  future  site  of  the  founding 
of  a  new  dynasty  originally  prophesied  in  the  eighteenth  century. 

Several  new  religions  derive  their  inspiration  from  Christianity. 
The  Chondogwan,  or  Evangelical  Church,  was  founded  by  Pak 
T'ae-son.  Pak  originally  was  a  Presbyterian,  but  was  expelled  from 
the  church  for  heresy  in  the  1950s  after  claiming  for  himself  unique 
spiritual  power.  By  1972  his  followers  numbered  as  many  as  700,000 
people,  and  he  built  several  "Christian  towns,"  established  a  large 
church  network,  and  managed  several  industrial  enterprises. 

Because  of  its  overseas  evangelism,  the  Hold  Spirit  Association 
for  the  Unification  of  the  World  Christianity,  or  Unification  Church 
(T'ongilgyo),  founded  in  1954  by  Reverend  Sun  Myong  Moon 
(Mun  Son-myong),  also  a  former  Christian,  is  the  most  famous

Korean  new  religion.  During  its  period  of  rigorous  expansion  during 
the  1970s,  the  Unification  Church  had  several  hundred  thousand 
members  in  South  Korea  and  Japan  and  a  substantial  (although 
generally  overestimated)  number  of  members  in  North  America 
and  Western  Europe.  Moon  claimed  that  he  was  the  "messiah" 
designated  by  God  to  unify  all  the  peoples  of  the  world  into  one 
"family,"  governed  theocratically  by  himself. 

Like  Pak's  Evangelical  Church,  the  Unification  Church  has  been 
highly  authoritarian,  demanding  absolute  obedience  from  church 
members.  Moon,  for  example,  has  arranged  marriages  for  his  youn- 
ger followers;  United  States  television  audiences  were  treated  some 
years  ago  to  a  mass  ceremony  at  which  several  hundred  young 
"Moonies"  were  married.  Also  like  Pak,  Moon  has  coupled  the 
church's  fortunes  to  economic  expansion.  Factories  in  South  Korea 
and  abroad  manufacture  arms  and  process  ginseng  and  seafood, 
artistic  bric-a-brac,  and  other  items.  Moon's  labor  force  has  worked 
long  hours  and  been  paid  minimal  wages  in  order  to  channel  profits 
into  church  coffers.  Virulently  anticommunist,  Moon  has  sought 
to  influence  public  opinion  at  home  and  abroad  by  establishing 
generally  unprofitable  newspapers  such  as  the  Segye  ilbo  in  Seoul, 
the  Sekai  nippo  in  Tokyo,  and  the  Washington  Times  in  the  United 
States  capital  and  by  inviting  academics  to  lavish  international  con- 
ferences, often  held  in  South  Korea.  At  home,  the  Unification 
Church  was  viewed  with  suspicion  by  the  authorities  because  of 
its  scandals  and  Moon's  evident  desire  to  create  a  "state  within 
a  state."  His  influence,  however,  had  declined  by  the  late  1980s. 

Religion  in  Contemporary  South  Korea 

According  to  government  statistics,  42.6  percent  or  more  than 
17  million  of  South  Korea's  1985  population  professed  adherence 
to  an  organized  religious  community.  There  were  at  least  8  mil- 
lion Buddhists  (about  20  percent  of  the  total  population),  about 
6.5  million  Protestants  (16  percent  of  the  population),  some  1.9 
million  Roman  Catholics  (5  percent),  nearly  500,000  people  who 
belonged  to  Confucian  groups  (1  percent),  and  more  than  300,000 
others  (0.7  percent).  Significantly,  large  metropolitan  areas  had 
the  highest  proportions  of  people  belonging  to  formal  religious 
groups:  49.9  percent  in  Seoul,  46.1  percent  in  Pusan,  and  45.8 
percent  in  Taegu.  The  figures  for  Christians  revealed  that  South 
Korea  had  the  highest  percentage  of  Christians  of  any  country  in 
East  Asia  or  Southeast  Asia,  with  the  exception  of  the  Philippines. 

Except  for  the  Christian  groups,  which  maintain  a  fairly  clear- 
cut  distinction  between  believers  and  nonbelievers,  there  is  some 
ambiguity  in  these  statistics.  As  has  been  pointed  out,  there  is  no 


127 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

exact  or  exclusive  criterion  by  which  Buddhists  or  Confucianists 
can  be  identified.  Many  people  outside  of  formal  groups  have  been 
deeply  influenced  by  these  traditions.  Moreover,  there  is  nothing 
contradictory  in  one  person's  visiting  and  praying  at  Buddhist  tem- 
ples, participating  in  Confucian  ancestor  rites,  and  even  consult- 
ing a  shaman  and  sponsoring  a  kut.  Furthermore,  the  statistics  may 
underrepresent  the  numbers  of  people  belonging  to  new  religions. 
Some  sources  have  given  the  number  of  adherents  of  Ch'ondogyo 
as  over  1  million. 

Given  the  great  diversity  of  religious  expression,  the  role  of 
religion  in  South  Korea's  social  development  has  been  a  complex 
one.  Some  traditions,  especially  Buddhism,  are  identified  primar- 
ily with  the  past.  Buddhist  sites  such  as  the  Pulguksa  Temple  and 
the  Sokkuram  Grotto  in  Kyongju  and  the  Haeinsa  Temple  near 
Taegu  are  regarded  by  most  South  Koreans  as  important  cultural 
properties  rather  than  as  places  of  worship.  Confucianism  remains 
important  as  a  social  ethic;  its  influence  is  evident  in  the  immense 
importance  Koreans  ascribe  to  education.  Christianity  is  identi- 
fied with  modernization  and  social  reform.  Many  Christians  in  con- 
temporary South  Korea,  such  as  veteran  political  opposition  leader 
Kim  Dae  Jung,  a  Catholic,  have  been  outspoken  advocates  of  hu- 
man rights  and  critics  of  the  government.  Christian-sponsored  or- 
ganizations such  as  the  Urban  Industrial  Mission  promote  labor 
organizations  and  the  union  movement.  New  religions  draw  on 
both  traditional  beliefs  and  on  Christianity,  achieving  a  baffling 
variety  and  diversity  of  views.  It  has  been  estimated  that  there  were 
as  many  as  300  new  religions  in  South  Korea  in  the  late  1980s, 
although  many  were  small  and  transient  phenomena. 

Public  Health  and  Welfare 

Health  conditions  have  improved  dramatically  since  the  end  of 
the  Korean  War.  Between  1955  and  1960,  life  expectancy  was  es- 
timated at  51.1  years  for  men  and  54.2  years  for  women.  In  1990 
life  expectancy  was  sixty- six  years  for  men  and  seventy-three  years 
for  women.  The  death  rate  declined  significantly,  from  13.8  deaths 
per  1,000  in  1955-60  to  6  deaths  per  1,000  in  1989— one  of  the 
lowest  rates  among  East  Asian  and  Southeast  Asian  countries. 

Nevertheless,  serious  health  problems  remained  in  1990.  South 
Korea's  infant  mortality  rate  was  significandy  higher  than  the  rates 
of  other  Asian  countries  and  territories  such  as  Japan,  Taiwan, 
Hong  Kong,  Singapore,  and  peninsular  Malaysia.  Although  prac- 
tically all  the  inhabitants  of  Seoul  and  other  large  cities  had  access  to 
running  water  and  sewage  disposal  in  the  late  1980s,  environmental 


128 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


pollution  and  poor  sanitation  still  posed  serious  threats  to  public 
health  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas. 

Health  Conditions 

The  main  causes  of  death  traditionally  have  been  respiratory 
diseases — tuberculosis,  bronchitis,  and  pneumonia — followed  by 
gastrointestinal  illnesses.  However,  the  incidence  and  fatality  of 
both  types  of  illness  declined  during  the  1970s  and  1980s.  Diseases 
typical  of  developed,  industrialized  countries — cancer,  heart,  liver 
and  kidney  ailments,  diabetes,  and  strokes— were  rapidly  becom- 
ing the  primary  causes  of  death.  The  incidence  of  parasitism,  once 
a  major  health  problem  in  farming  communities  because  of  the 
widespread  use  of  night  soil  as  fertilizer,  was  reported  in  the  late 
1980s  to  be  only  4  percent  of  what  it  had  been  in  1970.  Encephali- 
tis, a  viral  disease  that  can  be  transmitted  to  humans  by  mosqui- 
toes, caused  ninety-four  deaths  in  1982.  To  reduce  fatalities,  the 
Ministry  of  Health  and  Social  Affairs  planned  to  vaccinate  17.2 
million  persons  against  the  disease  by  1988. 

The  tensions  and  social  dislocations  caused  by  rapid  urbaniza- 
tion apparently  increased  the  incidence  of  mental  illness.  In  1985 
the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Social  Affairs  began  a  large-scale  pro- 
gram to  expand  mental  health  treatment  facilities  by  opening  mental 
institutions  and  requiring  that  new  hospitals  have  wards  set  aside 
for  psychiatric  treatment.  The  ministry  estimated  the  number  of 
persons  suffering  from  mental  ailments  at  around  400,000. 

South  Korea  has  not  been  entirely  immune  from  the  health  and 
social  problems  generally  associated  with  the  West,  such  as  acquired 
immune  deficiency  syndrome  (AIDS)  and  addictive  drugs.  A  hand- 
ful of  AIDS  cases  was  reported  during  the  late  1980s.  Seoul  respond- 
ed by  increasing  the  budget  for  education  programs  and  instituting 
mandatory  AIDS  testing  of  prostitutes  and  employees  of  entertain- 
ment establishments.  An  AIDS  Prevention  Law  was  promulgated 
in  November  1987.  In  late  1989,  the  government  drafted  a  law 
requiring  AIDS  testing  of  foreign  athletes  and  entertainers  intending 
to  reside  in  South  Korea  without  their  spouses  for  more  than  three 
months.  Previously,  the  majority  of  those  infected  with  AIDS  had 
been  prostitutes  working  near  United  States  military  bases,  ocean- 
going seamen,  and  South  Koreans  working  abroad.  In  the  late 
1980s,  however,  homosexuals  began  to  account  for  an  increasing 
number  of  those  infected  with  the  AIDS  virus.  The  traditional 
Korean  attitude  toward  homosexuality,  which  was  to  deny  its  ex- 
istence, made  it  extremely  difficult  to  treat  this  part  of  the  popula- 
tion.   The   200-percent   annual   increase   in   the  number 


129 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

of  AIDS-infected  persons  (from  one  reported  case  in  1985  to  twenty- 
two  cases  in  1988)  worried  health  officials. 

While  the  use  of  heroin  and  other  opiates  was  rare  in  South  Korea 
and  the  use  of  cocaine  limited,  the  use  of  crystalline  methampheta- 
mine,  or  "ice,"  known  in  South  Korea  as  hiroppon,  had  become 
a  serious  problem  by  the  late  1980s.  Estimates  of  the  number  of 
South  Korean  abusers  of  this  illegal  drug  (known  in  the  United 
States  as  speed)  ranged  from  100,000  to  300,000  people  in  the  late 
1980s.  Because  use  of  the  drug  was  believed  to  involve  just  low- 
status  members  of  society,  such  as  prostitutes  and  gangsters,  the 
problem  of  hiroppon  abuse  had  long  been  ignored  in  South  Korea. 
The  problem  received  greater  attention  from  police  and  other 
government  agencies  during  the  late  1980s  as  the  drug  increased 
in  popularity  among  professionals,  students,  office  workers,  house- 
wives, entertainers,  farmers,  and  laborers.  Some  observers  sug- 
gested the  drug's  popularity  was  caused  in  part  by  a  high-pressure 
work  environment,  in  which  people  used  hiroppon  to  cope  with  long 
working  hours.  It  also  has  been  suggested  that  the  tighter  border 
controls  imposed  by  Seoul  have  resulted  in  diverting  the  product 
to  the  domestic  market  and  contributing  to  greater  domestic  con- 
sumption. 

An  estimated  2,000  to  4,000  kilograms  of  methamphetamine  were 
produced  within  South  Korea  annually,  much  of  this  total  destined 
for  shipment  to  Taiwan,  Japan,  and  the  United  States  by  South 
Korean  and  Japanese yakuza,  or  gangsters.  Since  the  majority  of 
users  injected  the  drug  intravenously  (although  smoking  and  snort- 
ing it  were  becoming  popular),  South  Korean  health  officials  were 
concerned  that  the  drug  could  contribute  to  the  spread  of  AIDS. 
In  1989  Seoul  established  a  new  antinarcotics  division  attached  to 
the  prosecutor  general's  office  and  increased  almost  fourfold  the 
number  of  drug  agents. 

Health  Care  and  Social  Welfare 

The  traditional  practice  of  medicine  in  Korea  was  influenced 
primarily,  although  not  exclusively,  by  China.  Over  the  centuries, 
Koreans  had  used  acupuncture  and  herbal  remedies  to  treat  a  wide 
variety  of  illnesses.  Large  compilations  of  herbal  and  other  prescrip- 
tions were  published  during  the  Choson  Dynasty:  the  85-volume 
Hyangyak  chipsongbang  (Great  Collection  of  Korean  Prescriptions) 
published  in  1433  and  the  365-volume  Uibangyuch'wi  (Great  Col- 
lection of  Medicines  and  Prescriptions)  published  in  1445.  Shops 
selling  traditional  medicines,  including  ginseng,  a  root  plant  be- 
lieved to  have  strong  medicinal  and  aphrodisiac  qualities,  still  were 
common  in  the  1980s.  Because  of  the  expense  of  modern  medical 


130 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


care,  people  still  had  to  rely  largely  on  such  remedies  to  treat  seri- 
ous illnesses  until  the  1980s,  particularly  in  rural  areas. 

The  number  of  physicians,  nurses,  dentists,  pharmacists,  and 
other  health  personnel  and  the  number  of  hospitals  and  clinics  have 
increased  dramatically  since  the  Korean  War  (see  fig.  8).  In  1974 
the  population  per  physician  was  2,207;  by  1983  this  number  had 
declined  to  1 ,509.  During  the  same  period,  the  number  of  general 
hospitals  grew  from  36  to  156  and  the  number  of  hospital  beds  tri- 
pled from  19,062  to  59,099.  Most  facilities,  however,  tended  to 
be  concentrated  in  urban  areas,  particularly  in  Seoul  and  Pusan. 
Rural  areas  had  limited  medical  facilities  because  in  the  past  there 
had  been  little  incentive  for  physicians  to  work  in  areas  outside 
the  cities,  where  the  major  of  the  people  could  not  pay  for  treat- 
ment. Several  private  rural  hospitals  had  been  established  with 
government  encouragement  but  had  gone  bankrupt  in  the  late 
1980s.  The  extension  of  medical  insurance  programs  to  the  rural 
populace,  however,  was  expected  to  alleviate  this  problem  to  some 
extent  during  the  1990s. 

The  South  Korean  government  committed  itself  to  making  med- 
ical security  (medical  insurance  and  medical  aid)  available  to  vir- 
tually the  entire  population  by  1991 .  There  was  no  unified  national 
health  insurance  system,  but  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Social  Af- 
fairs coordinated  its  efforts  with  those  of  employers  and  private  in- 
surance firms  to  achieve  this  goal.  Two  programs  were  established 
in  1977:  the  Free  and  Subsidized  Medical  Aid  Program  for  people 
whose  income  was  below  a  certain  level  and  a  medical  insurance 
program  that  provided  coverage  for  individuals  and  their  immediate 
families  working  in  enterprises  of  500  people  or  more.  Expenses 
were  shared  equally  by  employers  and  workers.  In  1979  coverage 
was  expanded  to  enterprises  comprising  300  or  more  people,  as 
well  as  to  civil  servants  and  teachers  in  private  schools.  In  1981 
coverage  was  extended  to  enterprises  employing  100  or  more  peo- 
ple and  in  1984  to  firms  with  as  few  as  16  employees.  In  that  year, 
16.7  million  persons,  or  41 .3  percent  of  the  population,  had  medi- 
cal insurance.  By  1988  the  government  had  expanded  medical  in- 
surance coverage  in  rural  areas  to  almost  7.5  million  people.  As 
of  the  end  of  1988,  approximately  33.1  million  people,  or  almost 
79  percent  of  the  population,  received  medical  insurance  benefits. 
At  that  time,  the  number  of  those  not  receiving  medical  insurance 
benefits  totaled  almost  9  million  people,  mostly  independent  small 
business  owners  in  urban  areas.  In  July  1989,  however,  Seoul  ex- 
tended medical  insurance  to  cover  these  self-employed  urbanites, 
so  that  the  medical  insurance  system  extended  to  almost  all  South 
Koreans.  Differences  in  insurance  premiums  among  small  business

owners,  government  officials  and  teachers,  people  in  farming  and 
fishing  areas,  and  those  employed  by  business  firms  remained  a 
divisive  and  unresolved  issue. 

Medical  insurance  programs  for  farming  and  fishing  communi- 
ties, where  the  majority  of  people  were  self-employed  or  worked 
for  very  small  enterprises,  also  were  initiated  by  the  government. 
In  1981  three  rural  communities  were  selected  as  experimental  sites 
for  implementation  of  a  comprehensive  medical  insurance  program. 
Three  more  areas,  including  Mokp'o  in  South  Cholla  Province, 
were  added  in  1982.  Industrial  injury  compensation  schemes  were 
begun  in  the  early  1960s  and  by  1982  covered  3.5  million  workers 
in  most  major  industries. 

During  the  1980s,  government  pension  or  social  security  insur- 
ance programs  covered  designated  groups,  such  as  civil  servants, 
military  personnel,  and  teachers.  Private  employers  had  their  own 
schemes  to  which  they  and  workers  both  contributed.  Government 
planners  envisioned  a  public  and  private  system  of  pensions  covering 
the  entire  population  by  the  early  1990s.  In  the  wake  of  rapid  eco- 
nomic growth,  large  sums  have  been  allocated  for  social  develop- 
ment programs  in  the  national  budget.  In  FY  (fiscal  year — see 
Glossary)  1990,  total  spending  in  this  area  increased  40  percent 
over  the  previous  year.  Observers  noted,  however,  that  serious  defi- 
ciencies existed  in  programs  for  the  handicapped,  single-parent 
families,  and  the  unemployed.

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

Virtues  in  Conflict,  a  collection  of  essays  edited  by  Sandra  Matiel- 
li,  and  Kim  Yung-chung's  Women  of  Korea  discuss  women's  roles 
in  Korean  society.  Female  shamans  are  discussed  in  Kim  Harvey 
Youngsook's  Six  Korean  Women  and  Laurel  Kendall's  The  Life  and 
Hard  Times  of  a  Korean  Shaman.  Kim  Chin-wu's  The  Making  of  the 
Korean  Language  provides  an  informative  account  of  that  subject. 

Interesting  discussions  of  South  Korea's  changing  social  classes 
are  contained  in  David  I.  Steinberg's  The  Republic  of  Korea  and  in 
Kim  Kyong-Dong's  "Social  Change  and  Societal  Developments 
in  Korea  since  1945."  Although  its  1980  publication  date  precludes 
discussion  of  the  major  changes  that  have  occurred  since  that  year, 
Education  and  Development  in  Korea  by  Noel  F.  McGinn  et  al.  pro- 
vides excellent  background  on  this  important  subject.  Recent  de- 
velopments are  covered  in  some  depth  by  publications  such  as  the 
Far  Eastern  Economic  Review,  whose  weekly  "Arts  and  Society"  sec- 
tion deals  extensively  with  education  and  other  social  matters.  Other 
periodicals  containing  discussions  of  South  Korean  society,  edu- 
cation, and  cultural  expression  include  Korea  Journal,  the  Social  Science

where  a  hidden  road  for  transporting  military  provisions  begins 


IN  THE  FIRST  THREE  decades  after  the  Park  Chung  Hee 
government  launched  the  First  Five-Year  Economic  Development 
Plan  in  1962,  the  South  Korean  economy  grew  enormously  and 
the  economic  structure  was  radically  transformed.  South  Korea's 
real  gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary)  expanded  by  an 
average  of  more  than  8  percent  per  year,  from  US$2.3  billion  in 
1962  to  US$204  billion  in  1989.  Per  capita  annual  income  grew 
from  US$87  in  1962  to  US$4,830  in  1989.  The  manufacturing  sec- 
tor grew  from  14.3  percent  of  the  GNP  in  1962  to  30.3  percent 
in  1987.  Commodity  trade  volume  rose  from  US$480  million  in 
1962  to  a  projected  US$127.9  billion  in  1990.  The  ratio  of  domes- 
tic savings  to  GNP  grew  from  3.3  percent  in  1962  to  35.8  percent 
in  1989. 

The  rapid  economic  growth  of  the  late  1980s,  however,  slowed 
considerably  in  1989.  The  growth  rate  was  cut  almost  in  half  from 
the  previous  year  (to  a  still-robust  approximate  6.5  percent),  the 
inflation  rate  increased  as  wages  soared  even  higher,  and  there  was 
speculation  concerning  a  small  trade  deficit  in  the  early  1990s.  These 
developments  all  pointed  to  a  gradual  slowing  of  the  expansion  of 
the  rapidly  maturing  economy.  Nevertheless,  it  also  was  clear  that 
rapidly  rising  domestic  demand  would  keep  the  economy  healthy 
(even  with  a  slight  drop-off  of  exports),  unless  a  major  political  crisis 
were  to  shock  the  country. 

The  most  significant  factor  in  rapid  industrialization  was  the 
adoption  of  an  outward-looking  strategy  in  the  early  1960s.  This 
strategy  was  particularly  well  suited  to  that  time  because  of  South 
Korea's  poor  natural  resource  endowment,  low  savings  rate,  and 
tiny  domestic  market.  The  strategy  promoted  economic  growth 
through  labor-intensive  manufactured  exports,  in  which  South 
Korea  could  develop  a  competitive  advantage.  Government  initia- 
tives played  an  important  role  in  this  process.  The  inflow  of  for- 
eign capital  was  greatly  encouraged  to  supplement  the  shortage  of 
domestic  savings.  These  efforts  enabled  South  Korea  to  achieve 
rapid  growth  in  exports  and  subsequent  increases  in  income. 

By  emphasizing  the  industrial  sector,  Seoul's  export-oriented  de- 
velopment strategy  left  the  rural  sector  relatively  underdeveloped. 
Increasing  income  disparity  between  the  industrial  and  agricultural 
sectors  became  a  serious  problem  by  the  1970s  and  remained  a 
problem,  despite  government  efforts  to  raise  farm  income  and  im- 
prove living  standards  in  rural  areas.

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

By  the  early  1970s,  however,  the  industrial  sector  had  begun  to 
face  problems  of  its  own.  Up  to  that  time,  the  industrial  structure 
had  been  based  on  low  value-added  and  labor-intensive  products, 
which  faced  increasing  competition  and  protectionism  from  other 
developing  countries.  The  government  responded  to  this  problem 
in  the  mid-1970s  by  emphasizing  the  development  of  heavy  and 
chemical  industries  and  by  promoting  investment  in  high  value- 
added,  capital-intensive  industries. 

The  structural  transition  to  high  value-added,  capital-intensive 
industries  was  difficult.  Moreover,  it  occurred  at  the  end  of  the 
1970s,  a  time  when  the  industrial  world  was  experiencing  a  pro- 
longed recession  following  the  second  oil  price  shock  of  the  decade 
and  protectionism  was  resulting  in  a  reduction  of  South  Korean 
exports.  By  1980  the  South  Korean  economy  had  entered  a  period 
of  temporary  decline:  negative  growth  was  recorded  for  the  first 
time  since  1962,  inflation  had  soared,  and  the  balance-of-payments 
position  had  deteriorated  significantly. 

In  the  early  1980s,  Seoul  instituted  wide-ranging  structural  re- 
forms. In  order  to  control  inflation,  a  conservative  monetary  policy 
and  tight  fiscal  measures  were  adopted.  Growth  of  the  money  supply 
was  reduced  from  the  30  percent  level  of  the  1970s  to  15  percent. 
Seoul  even  froze  its  budget  for  a  short  while.  Government  inter- 
vention in  the  economy  was  greatly  reduced  and  policies  on  imports 
and  foreign  investment  were  liberalized  to  promote  competition. 
To  reduce  the  imbalance  between  rural  and  urban  sectors,  Seoul 
expanded  investments  in  public  projects,  such  as  roads  and  com- 
munications facilities,  while  further  promoting  farm  mechanization. 

These  measures,  coupled  with  significant  improvements  in  the 
world  economy,  helped  the  South  Korean  economy  regain  its  lost 
momentum  in  the  late  1980s.  South  Korea  achieved  an  average 
of  9.2  percent  real  growth  between  1982  and  1987  and  12.5  per- 
cent between  1986  and  1988.  The  double  digit  inflation  of  the  1970s 
was  brought  under  control.  Wholesale  price  inflation  averaged  2.1 
percent  per  year  from  1980  through  1988;  consumer  prices  increased 
by  an  average  of  4.7  percent  annually.  Seoul  achieved  its  first  sig- 
nificant surplus  in  its  balance  of  payments  in  1986  and  recorded 
a  US$7.7  billion  and  a  US$11.4  billion  surplus  in  1987  and  1988 
respectively.  This  development  permitted  South  Korea  to  begin 
reducing  its  level  of  foreign  debt.  The  trade  surplus  for  1989, 
however,  was  only  US$4.6  billion  dollars,  and  a  small  negative 
balance  was  projected  for  1990  (see  table  2,  Appendix). 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  domestic  market  became  an  increasing 
source  of  economic  growth.  Domestic  demand  for  automobiles  and 
other  indigenously  manufactured  goods  soared  because  South 


138 


The  Economy 


Korean  consumers,  whose  savings  had  been  buoyed  by  double- 
digit  wage  increases  each  year  since  1987  and  whose  average  wages 
in  1990  were  about  50  percent  above  what  they  had  been  at  the 
end  of  1986,  had  the  wherewithal  to  purchase  luxury  items  for  the 
first  time.  The  result  was  a  gradual  reorientation  of  the  economy 
from  a  heavy  reliance  on  exports  toward  greater  emphasis  on  meet- 
ing the  needs  of  the  country's  nearly  43  million  people.  The  shifts 
in  demand  and  supply  indicated  that  economic  restructuring  was 
underway,  that  is,  domestic  consumption  was  rising  as  net  foreign 
demand  was  falling.  On  the  supply  side,  the  greater  growth  in  ser- 
vices mirrored  what  the  people  wanted — more  goods,  especially 
imports,  and  many  more  services. 

By  1990  there  was  evidence  that  the  high  growth  rates  of  the 
late  1980s  would  slow  during  the  early  1990s.  In  1989  real  growth 
was  only  6.5  percent.  One  reason  for  this  development  was  the 
economic  restructuring  that  began  in  the  late  1980s — including 
the  slower  growth  of  major  export  industries  that  were  no  longer 
competitive  on  the  world  market  (for  example,  footwear)  and  the 
expansion  of  those  industries  that  were  competitive,  such  as  elec- 
tronics. 

The  Japanese  Role  in  Korea's  Economic  Development 

The  Japanese,  who  dominated  Korea  from  the  late  1890s  to  1945 
and  who  governed  Korea  as  a  colony  from  1910  to  1945,  were 
responsible  for  the  initial  economic  modernization  of  Korea.  Be- 
fore 1900  Korea  had  a  relatively  backward  agricultural  economy. 
According  to  scholar  Donald  S.  Macdonald,  for  centuries  most 
Koreans  lived  as  subsistence  farmers  of  rice  and  other  grains  and 
satisfied  most  of  their  basic  needs  through  their  own  labor  or  through 
barter.  The  manufactures  of  traditional  Korea — principally  cloth, 
cooking  and  eating  utensils,  furniture,  jewelry,  and  paper — were 
produced  by  artisans  in  a  few  population  centers. 

Following  the  annexation  of  Korea  in  1910,  Japan  thrust  a 
modern  blend  of  industrial  capitalism  onto  a  feudal  agrarian  society. 
By  the  end  of  the  colonial  period,  Japan  had  built  an  extensive  in- 
frastructure of  roads,  railroads,  ports,  electrical  power,  and  govern- 
ment buildings  that  facilitated  both  the  modernization  of  Korea's 
economy  and  Japan's  control  over  the  modernization  process.  The 
Japanese  located  various  heavy  industries — steel,  chemicals,  and 
hydroelectric  power — across  Korea,  but  mainly  in  the  north. 

The  Japanese  government  played  an  even  more  active  role  in 
developing  Korea  than  it  had  played  in  developing  the  Japanese 
economy  in  the  late  nineteenth  century.  Many  programs  drafted 


139 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


in  Korea  in  the  1920s  and  1930s  originated  in  policies  drafted  in 
Japan  during  the  Meiji  period  (1868-1912).  The  Japanese  govern- 
ment helped  to  mobilize  resources  for  development  and  provided 
entrepreneurial  leadership  for  these  new  enterprises.  Colonial  eco- 
nomic growth  was  initiated  through  powerful  government  efforts 
to  expand  the  economic  infrastructure,  to  increase  investment  in  hu- 
man capital  through  health  and  education,  and  to  raise  productivity. 

In  some  respects,  South  Korean  patterns  of  development  after 
the  early  1960s  closely  followed  the  methodology  introduced  by  the 
Japanese  fifty  years  earlier — industrialization  from  above  using  a 
strong  bureaucracy  that  formulated  and  implemented  economic 
policies.  Many  of  the  developments  that  took  place  in  Chosen,  the 
Japanese  name  for  Korea  during  the  period  of  colonization,  had 
also  occurred  in  pre-World  War  II  Japan;  they  were  implementa- 
tion of  a  strong  education  system  and  the  spread  of  literacy;  the 
rise  of  a  strong,  authoritarian  government  that  combined  civilian 
and  military  administration  to  govern  the  state  with  strict  discipline; 
the  fostering  and  implementation  of  comprehensive  economic  pro- 
grams by  the  state  through  its  control  of  the  huge  national 
bureaucracy;  the  close  collaboration  between  government  and  busi- 
ness leaders;  and  the  development  of  industries  by  the  major 
Japanese  zaibatsu  (commercial  conglomerates). 

Some  political  analysts,  for  example,  Bruce  Cumings  and  Gavan 
McCormick,  have  been  impressed  with  the  common  elements  in 
prewar  and  postwar  economic  growth  in  South  Korea  and  espe- 
cially with  top-down  government  management  of  the  economy. 
Economists,  such  as  Paul  W.  Kuznets,  however,  also  draw  atten- 
tion to  the  dysfunctional  aspects  of  the  colonial  legacy  and  find  some 
of  the  discontinuities  important. 

Between  the  end  of  World  War  II  and  Park  Chung  Hee's  ascen- 
sion to  power  in  1961 ,  South  Korea's  political  and  economic  links 
to  the  Japanese  colonial  period  were  ruptured.  There  was  consider- 
able disruption  after  1945  because  of  plant  exhaustion;  the  loss  of 
linkages  with  Japanese  capital  and  with  upstream  and  downstream 
industrial  facilities;  the  loss  of  technical  expertise,  distribution  sys- 
tems, and  markets;  and  the  subsequent  obliteration  of  the  indus- 
trial plant  during  the  Korean  War  (1950-53). 

The  Government  Role  in  Economic  Development 

In  1961  General  Park  Chung  Hee  overthrew  the  popularly  elected 
regime  of  Prime  Minister  Chang  Myon.  A  nationalist,  Park  wanted 
to  transform  South  Korea  from  a  backward  agricultural  nation  into 


140 


The  Economy 


a  modern  industrial  nation  that  would  provide  a  decent  way  of  life 
for  its  citizens  while  at  the  same  time  defending  itself  from  outside 
aggression.  Lacking  the  anti-Japanese  nationalist  credentials  of  Syng- 
man  Rhee,  for  example,  Park  sought  both  legitimacy  for  his  regime 
and  greater  independence  for  South  Korea  in  a  vigorous  program 
of  economic  development  that  would  transform  the  country  from 
an  agricultural  backwater  into  a  modern  industrial  nation. 

Park's  government  was  the  beneficiary  of  the  Syngman  Rhee 
administration's  decision  to  use  foreign  aid  from  the  United  States 
during  the  1950s  to  build  an  infrastructure  that  included  a  nation- 
wide network  of  primary  and  secondary  schools,  modern  roads, 
and  a  modern  communications  network.  The  result  was  that  by 
1961,  South  Korea  had  a  well-educated  young  work  force  and  a 
modern  infrastructure  that  provided  Park  with  a  solid  foundation 
for  economic  growth. 

The  Park  administration  decided  that  the  central  government 
must  play  the  key  role  in  economic  development  because  no  other 
South  Korean  institution  had  the  capacity  or  resources  to  direct 
such  drastic  change  in  a  short  time.  The  resulting  economic  sys- 
tem incorporated  elements  of  both  state  capitalism  and  free  enter- 
prise. The  economy  was  dominated  by  a  group  of  chaebol  (see 
Glossary),  large  private  conglomerates,  and  also  was  supported  by 
a  significant  number  of  public  corporations  in  such  areas  as  iron 
and  steel,  utilities,  communications,  fertilizers,  chemicals,  and  other 
heavy  industries.  The  government  guided  private  industry  through 
a  series  of  export  and  production  targets  utilizing  the  control  of 
credit,  informal  means  of  pressure  and  persuasion,  and  tradition- 
al monetary  and  fiscal  policies  (see  The  Origins  and  Development 
of  Chaebol,  this  ch.). 

The  government  hoped  to  take  advantage  of  existing  technolo- 
gy to  become  competitive  in  areas  where  other  advanced  industri- 
al nations  had  already  achieved  success.  Seoul  presumed  that  the 
well-educated  and  highly  motivated  work  force  would  produce  low- 
cost,  high-quality  goods  that  would  find  ready  markets  in  the  United 
States  and  the  rest  of  the  industrial  world.  Profits  generated  from 
the  sale  of  exports  would  be  used  to  further  expand  capital,  pro- 
vide new  jobs,  and  eventually  pay  off  loans. 

In  1961  Park  extended  government  control  over  business  by  na- 
tionalizing the  banks  and  merging  the  agricultural  cooperative 
movement  with  the  agricultural  bank.  The  government's  direct  con- 
trol over  all  institutional  credit  further  extended  Park's  command 
over  the  business  community.  The  Economic  Planning  Board  was 
created  in  1961  and  became  the  nerve  center  of  Park's  plan  to 


141 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

promote  economic  development.  It  was  headed  by  a  deputy  prime 
minister  and  staffed  by  bureaucrats  known  for  their  high  intellec- 
tual capability  and  educational  background  in  business  and  eco- 
nomics. Beginning  in  the  1960s,  the  board  allocated  resources, 
directed  the  flow  of  credit,  and  formulated  all  of  South  Korea's 
economic  plans.  In  the  late  1980s,  the  power  to  allocate  resources 
and  credit  was  restored  to  the  functional  ministries.  In  1990  the 
Economic  Planning  Board  primarily  was  charged  with  economic 
planning;  it  also  coordinated  and  often  directed  the  economic  func- 
tions of  other  government  ministries,  including  the  Ministry  of 
Finance.  The  board  was  complemented  by  the  Korea  Development 
Institute,  an  independent  economic  research  organization  funded 
by  the  government.  Other  government  bodies  directing  the  econ- 
omy included  the  Office  of  the  President,  which  included  a  senior 
secretary  for  economic  affairs;  the  Ministry  of  Finance;  the  Ministry 
of  Trade  and  Industry;  the  Ministry  of  Labor;  and  the  Bank  of 
Korea,  which  was  controlled  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance. 

Park's  first  major  goal,  which  was  immediately  successful,  was 
to  establish  a  self-reliant  industrial  economy  independent  of  the 
massive  waves  of  United  States  aid  that  had  kept  South  Korea  afloat 
during  the  Rhee  years.  Modernizing  the  economy  and  maintain- 
ing overall  sustained  growth  were  additional  goals  in  the  1970s. 
Significant  economic  policies  included  strengthening  key  industries, 
increasing  employment,  and  developing  more  effective  manage- 
ment systems.  Because  South  Korea  was  dependent  on  imports  of 
raw  materials,  such  as  oil,  a  major  government  objective  was  to  sig- 
nificantly increase  the  level  of  exports,  which  meant  stressing  greater 
international  competitiveness  and  higher  productivity.  The  early 
economic  plans  emphasized  agriculture  and  infrastructure,  the  latter 
were  closely  tied  to  construction.  Later,  the  emphasis  shifted  consecu- 
tively to  light  industry,  electronics,  and  heavy  and  chemical  indus- 
tries. Using  these  strategies,  an  export-driven  economy  developed. 

The  government  combined  a  policy  of  import  substitution  with 
the  export-led  approach.  Policy  planners  selected  a  group  of  stra- 
tegic industries  to  back,  including  electronics,  shipbuilding,  and 
automobiles.  New  industries  were  nurtured  by  making  the  impor- 
tation of  such  goods  difficult.  When  the  new  industry  was  on  its 
feet,  the  government  worked  to  create  good  conditions  for  its  ex- 
port. Incentives  for  exports  included  a  reduction  of  corporate  and 
private  income  taxes  for  exporters,  tariff  exemptions  for  raw  materi- 
als imported  for  export  production,  business  tax  exemptions,  and 
accelerated  depreciation  allowances. 

The  export-led  program  took  off  in  the  1960s;  during  the  1970s, 
some  estimates  indicate,  Seoul  had  the  world's  most  productive 


142

economy.  The  annual  industrial  production  growth  rate  was  about 
25  percent;  there  was  a  fivefold  increase  in  the  GNP  from  1965  to 
1978.  In  the  mid-1970s,  exports  increased  by  an  average  of  45  per- 
cent a  year. 

Industrial  Policies 

The  major  issue  facing  the  Park  regime  in  the  early  1960s  was 
the  grinding  poverty  of  the  nation  and  the  need  for  economic  poli- 
cies to  overcome  this  poverty.  A  critical  problem  was  raising  funds 
to  foster  needed  industrial  development.  Domestic  savings  were  very 
low,  and  there  was  little  available  domestic  capital.  This  obstacle 
was  overcome  by  introducing  foreign  loans  and  inaugurating  attrac- 
tive domestic  interest  rates  that  enticed  local  capital  into  produc- 
tion. Of  South  Korea,  Taiwan,  Hong  Kong,  and  Singapore,  only 
South  Korea  financed  its  economic  development  with  a  dramatic 
build-up  of  foreign  debt,  debt  that  totaled  US$46.8  billion  in  1985, 
making  it  the  fourth  largest  Third  World  debtor.  Foreign  corporate 
investments  were  primarily  of  Japanese  origin. 

As  noted  by  consultant  David  I.  Steinberg,  Seoul  administered 
a  series  of  economic  development  plans.  The  government  mobilized 
domestic  capital  by  encouraging  savings,  determined  what  kinds  of 
plants  could  be  constructed  with  these  funds,  and  reviewed  the  poten- 
tial of  the  products  for  export.  In  this  sense,  the  will  of  the  govern- 
ment to  undertake  economic  development  played  a  crucial  role;  the 


143 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

role  of  the  government,  however,  was  not  limited  to  such  mea- 
sures as  mobilizing  capital  and  allocating  investments. 

Steinberg  also  pointed  out  that  Park's  government  restructured 
industries,  such  as  defense  and  construction,  sometimes  to  stimu- 
late competition  and  other  times  to  reduce  or  eliminate  it.  The  Eco- 
nomic Planning  Board  established  export  targets  that,  if  met,  yielded 
additional  government- subsidized  credit  and  further  access  to  the 
growing  domestic  market.  Failure  to  meet  such  targets  led  to  Seoul's 
withdrawal  of  credit. 

Economic  Plans 

Economic  programs  were  based  on  a  series  of  five-year  plans 
that  began  in  1962.  The  First  Five- Year  Economic  Development 
Plan  (1962-66)  consisted  of  initial  steps  toward  the  building  of  a 
self-sufficient  industrial  structure  that  was  neither  consumption 
oriented  nor  overdependent  on  oil.  Such  areas  as  electrification, 
fertilizers,  oil  refining,  synthetic  fibers,  and  cement  were  empha- 
sized. The  Second  Five- Year  Economic  Development  Plan  (1967-71) 
stressed  modernizing  the  industrial  structure  and  rapidly  building 
import-substitution  industries,  including  steel,  machinery,  and  chem- 
ical industries.  The  Third  Five- Year  Economic  Development  Plan 
(1972-76)  achieved  rapid  progress  in  building  an  export-oriented 
structure  by  promoting  heavy  and  chemical  industries.  Industries 
receiving  particular  attention  included  iron  and  steel,  transport 
machinery,  household  electronics,  shipbuilding,  and  petrochemicals. 
The  developers  of  heavy  and  chemical  industries  sought  to  supply 
new  industries  with  raw  materials  and  capital  goods  and  to  reduce 
or  even  eliminate  dependence  on  foreign  capital.  New  (and  criti- 
cal) industries  were  to  be  constructed  in  the  southern  part  of  the 
peninsula,  far  from  the  border  with  North  Korea,  thus  encourag- 
ing economic  development  and  industrialization  outside  the  Seoul 
area  and  providing  new  employment  opportunities  for  residents  of 
the  less  developed  areas. 

The  Fourth  Five-Year  Economic  Development  Plan  (1977-81) 
fostered  the  development  of  industries  designed  to  compete  effec- 
tively in  the  world's  industrial  export  markets.  These  major  stra- 
tegic industries  consisted  of  technology-intensive  and  skilled 
labor-intensive  industries  such  as  machinery,  electronics,  and  ship- 
building. The  plan  stressed  large  heavy  and  chemical  industries,  such 
as  iron  and  steel,  petrochemicals,  and  nonferrous  metal.  As  a  result, 
heavy  and  chemical  industries  grew  by  an  impressive  51.8  percent 
in  1981;  their  exports  increased  to  45.3  percent  of  total  output.  These 
developments  can  be  ascribed  to  a  favorable  turn  in  the  export  per- 
formance of  iron,  steel,  and  shipbuilding,  which  occurred  because 


144 


The  Economy 


high-quality,  low-cost  products  could  be  produced  in  South  Korea. 
By  contrast,  the  heavy  and  chemical  industries  of  advanced  coun- 
tries slumped  during  the  late  1970s.  In  the  machinery  industries, 
investments  were  doubled  in  electric  power  generation,  integrat- 
ed machinery,  diesel  engines,  and  heavy  construction  equipment; 
the  increase  clearly  showed  that  the  industries  benefited  from  the 
government's  generous  financial  assistance  program. 

The  late  1970s,  however,  witnessed  worldwide  recession,  rising 
fuel  costs,  and  growing  inflation.  South  Korea's  industrial  struc- 
ture became  somewhat  unbalanced,  and  the  economy  suffered  from 
acute  inflation  because  of  an  overemphasis  on  investment  in  heavy 
industry  at  a  time  when  many  potential  customers  were  not  in  a 
position  to  buy  heavy  industrial  goods. 

The  Fifth  Five- Year  Economic  and  Social  Development  Plan 
(1982-86)  sought  to  shift  the  emphasis  away  from  heavy  and  chem- 
ical industries,  to  technology-intensive  industries,  such  as  preci- 
sion machinery,  electronics  (televisions,  videocassette  recorders, 
and  semiconductor-related  products),  and  information.  More  at- 
tention was  to  be  devoted  to  building  high-technology  products  in 
greater  demand  on  the  world  market. 

The  Sixth  Five-Year  Economic  and  Social  Development  Plan 
(1987-91)  to  a  large  extent  continued  to  emphasize  the  goals  of 
the  previous  plan.  The  government  intended  to  accelerate  import 
liberalization  and  to  remove  various  types  of  restrictions  and  non- 
tariff  barriers  on  imports.  These  moves  were  designed  to  mitigate 
adverse  effects,  such  as  monetary  expansion  and  delays  in  indus- 
trial structural  adjustment,  which  can  arise  because  of  a  large  sur- 
plus of  funds.  Seoul  pledged  to  continue  phasing  out  direct  assistance 
to  specific  industries  and  instead  to  expand  manpower  training  and 
research  and  development  in  all  industries,  especially  the  small  and 
medium- sized  firms  that  had  not  received  much  government  atten- 
tion previously.  Seoul  hoped  to  accelerate  the  development  of  science 
and  technology  by  raising  the  ratio  of  research  and  development 
investment  from  2.4  percent  of  the  GNP  to  over  3  percent  by  1991 . 

The  goal  of  the  Seventh  Five-Year  Economic  and  Social  Develop- 
ment Plan  (1992-96),  formulated  in  1989,  was  to  develop  high- 
technology  fields,  such  as  microelectronics,  new  materials,  fine 
chemicals,  bioengineering,  optics,  and  aerospace.  Government  and 
industry  would  work  together  to  build  high-technology  facilities  in 
seven  provincial  cities  to  better  balance  the  geographic  distribu- 
tion of  industry  throughout  South  Korea.

in  real  terms  and  as  a  proportion  of  real  GNP,  since  the  end  of 
the  Korean  War,  stabilizing  at  between  20  and  21  percent  of  GNP 
during  most  of  the  1980s.  Government  spending  in  South  Korea 
has  been  less  than  that  for  most  countries  in  the  world  (excepting 
the  other  rapidly  growing  Asian  economies  of  Japan,  Taiwan,  and 
Singapore).  The  share  of  government  spending  devoted  to  invest- 
ment and  other  capital  formation  activities  increased  steadily  through 
the  periods  of  the  first  and  second  five-year  plans  (1962-71),  peaking 
at  more  than  41  percent  of  the  budget  in  1969.  Since  1971  invest- 
ment expenditures  have  remained  at  less  than  30  percent  of  the 
budget,  while  the  share  of  the  budget  occupied  by  direct  govern- 
ment consumption  and  transfer  payments  has  continued  to  increase, 
averaging  more  than  70  percent  during  the  1980s. 

During  the  1980s,  the  largest  areas  of  government  expenditure 
were  economic  services  (including  infrastructural  projects  and 
research  and  development),  national  defense,  and  education.  Eco- 
nomic expenditures  averaged  several  percentage  points  higher  than 
defense  expenditures,  which  remained  stable  at  about  22  to  23  per- 
cent of  the  budget  (about  6  percent  of  GNP)  during  the  decade. 
In  1990  the  government  was  studying  plans  to  lower  defense  ex- 
penditures to  5  percent  of  GNP.  Some  observers  noted  a  trend 
toward  a  slight  increase  in  the  portion  of  the  budget  devoted  to 
social  spending  during  the  1980s.  In  1987  expenditures  for  social 
services — including  health,  housing,  and  welfare — were  16.4  per- 
cent of  the  budget,  up  from  13.9  percent  in  1980,  and  slighdy  higher 
than  1987  government  oudays  for  education  (see  table  3,  Appendix). 

The  government  revenue  structure  was  virtually  totally  depen- 
dent on  taxes  (see  table  4,  Appendix).  By  the  early  1980s,  nearly 
two-thirds  of  tax  money  was  collected  in  the  form  of  indirect  taxes. 
Revenues  collected  by  the  central  government  in  1987  rose  to 
19,270.3  billion  won  (for  value  of  the  won — see  Glossary),  up  from 
13.197.5  billion  won  in  1984. 

The  Government  and  Public  and  Private  Corporations 

Following  the  Korean  War,  foreign  aid  became  the  most  im- 
portant source  of  funds  for  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation 
of  the  economy.  What  was  left  of  the  Japanese-built  industrial  plant, 
most  of  which  by  the  1950s  either  was  obsolete  or  had  been  de- 
stroyed by  warfare),  generally  was  turned  over  to  private  owners, 
who  were  chosen  more  often  for  their  political  loyalty  than  for  their 
economic  acumen.  Moreover,  Rhee  favored  certain  businessmen 
and  companies  with  government  contracts  in  exchange  for  finan- 
cial support  of  his  political  endeavors.  It  was  during  this  period 
that  a  group  of  entrepreneurs  began  companies  that  later  became 


146 


The  Economy 


the  chaebol,  or  business  conglomerates.  The  chaebol  were  groups  of 
specialized  companies  with  interrelated  management.  These  group- 
ings of  affiliated  companies  dominated  South  Korea's  economy  in 
the  late  1980s  and  often  included  businesses  involved  in  heavy  and 
consumer  industries  and  electric  and  electronic  goods,  as  well  as 
trading  companies  and  real  estate  and  insurance  concerns. 

The  chaebol  were  responsible  for  the  successful  expansion  of  South 
Korea's  export  capacity.  According  to  Steinberg,  in  1987  the 
revenues  of  the  four  largest  chaebol  were  US$80.7  billion,  a  figure 
equivalent  to  two- thirds  of  Seoul's  total  GNP.  In  that  year,  the 
Samsung  Group  had  revenues  of  US$24  billion;  Hyundai,  US$22.7 
billion;  Daewoo,  US$16  billion;  and  Lucky-Goldstar,  US$18  bil- 
lion. The  revenues  of  the  next  largest  chaebol,  Sunkyong,  totaled 
US$7.3  billion  in  1987.  The  top  ten  chaebol  represented  40  percent 
of  all  bank  credit  in  South  Korea,  30  percent  of  value  added  in 
manufacturing,  and  approximately  66  percent  of  the  value  of  all 
South  Korean  exports  in  1987.  The  five  largest  chaebol  employed 
8.5  percent  of  the  manufacturing  work  force  and  produced  22.3 
percent  of  all  manufacturing  shipments.  Despite  a  rash  of  strikes 
against  the  chaebol  beginning  in  1987,  the  chaebol  generally  had  higher 
compensation  and  better  working  conditions  than  their  lesser  South 
Korean  competitors. 

The  Origins  and  Development  of  Chaebol 

Although  South  Korea's  major  industrial  programs  did  not  be- 
gin until  the  early  1960s,  the  origins  of  the  country's  entrepreneur- 
ial elite  were  found  in  the  political  economy  of  the  1950s.  Very 
few  Koreans  had  owned  or  managed  larger  corporations  during 
the  Japanese  colonial  period.  After  the  departure  of  the  Japanese 
in  1945,  some  Korean  businessmen  obtained  the  assets  of  some 
of  the  Japanese  firms,  a  number  of  which  grew  into  the  chaebol  of 
the  1990s.  These  companies,  as  well  as  certain  other  firms  that  were 
formed  in  the  late  1940s  and  early  1950s,  had  close  links  with  Syng- 
man  Rhee's  First  Republic,  which  lasted  from  1948  to  1960  (see 
The  Syngman  Rhee  Era,  1948-60,  ch.  1).  It  was  alleged  that  many 
of  these  companies  received  special  favors  from  the  government 
in  return  for  kickbacks  and  other  payments. 

When  the  military  took  over  the  government  in  1961,  military 
leaders  announced  that  they  would  eradicate  the  corruption  that 
had  plagued  the  Rhee  administration  and  eliminate  injustice  from 
society.  Some  leading  industrialists  were  arrested  and  charged  with 
corruption,  but  the  new  government  realized  that  it  would  need 
the  help  of  the  entrepreneurs  if  the  government's  ambitious  plans 
to  modernize  the  economy  were  to  be  fulfilled.  A  compromise  was 


147 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

reached,  under  which  many  of  the  accused  corporate  leaders  paid 
fines  to  the  government.  Subsequentiy,  there  was  increased  cooper- 
ation between  corporate  and  government  leaders  in  modernizing 
the  economy. 

Government-chaebol  cooperation  was  essential  to  the  subsequent 
economic  growth  and  astounding  successes  that  began  in  the  early 
1960s.  Driven  by  the  urgent  need  to  turn  the  economy  away  from 
consumer  goods  and  light  industries  toward  heavy,  chemical,  and 
import-substitution  industries,  political  leaders  and  government 
planners  relied  on  the  ideas  and  cooperation  of  the  chaebol  leaders. 
The  government  provided  the  blueprints  for  industrial  expansion; 
the  chaebol  realized  the  plans.  However,  the  chaebol-led  industriali- 
zation accelerated  the  monopolistic  and  oligopolistic  concentration 
of  capital  and  economically  profitable  activities  in  the  hands  of  a 
limited  number  of  conglomerates. 

Park  used  the  chaebol  as  a  means  towards  economic  growth.  Ex- 
ports were  encouraged,  reversing  Rhee's  policy  of  reliance  on  im- 
ports. Performance  quotas  were  established. 

The  chaebol  were  able  to  grow  because  of  two  factors — foreign 
loans  and  special  favors.  Access  to  foreign  technology  also  was  crit- 
ical to  the  growth  of  the  chaebol  through  the  1980s.  Under  the  guise 
of 4 'guided  capitalism,"  the  government  selected  companies  to  un- 
dertake projects  and  channeled  funds  from  foreign  loans.  The 
government  guaranteed  repayment  should  a  company  be  unable 
to  repay  its  foreign  creditors.  Additional  loans  were  made  avail- 
able from  domestic  banks.  In  the  late  1980s,  the  chaebol  dominated 
the  industrial  sector  and  were  especially  prevalent  in  manufactur- 
ing, trading,  and  heavy  industries. 

The  chaebol  were  often  compared  with  Japanese  keiretsu  (the  suc- 
cessor of  the  zaibatsu),  but  as  David  I.  Steinberg  has  noted,  there 
were  at  least  three  major  differences.  First,  the  chaebol  were  family 
dominated.  In  1990,  for  example,  in  most  cases  the  family  that 
founded  the  major  business  in  the  chaebol  remained  in  control,  while 
in  Japan  the  keiretsu  were  controlled  by  professional  corporate 
management.  Second,  individual  chaebol  were  prevented  from  buy- 
ing controlling  shares  of  banks,  and  in  1990  government  regula- 
tions made  it  difficult  for  a  chaebol  to  develop  an  exclusive  banking 
relationship.  The  keiretsu  usually  worked  with  an  affiliated  bank  and 
had  almost  unlimited  access  to  credit.  Third,  the  chaebol  often  formed 
subsidiaries  to  produce  components  for  exports,  while  large 
Japanese  corporations  often  employed  outside  contractors. 

The  tremendous  growth  that  the  chaebol  experienced,  beginning 
in  the  early  1960s,  was  closely  tied  to  the  expansion  of  South  Korean 
exports.  Growth  resulted  from  the  production  of  a  diversity  of  goods 


148 


The  Economy 


rather  than  just  one  or  two  products.  Innovation  and  the  willing- 
ness to  develop  new  product  lines  were  critical.  In  the  1950s  and 
early  1960s,  chaebol  concentrated  on  wigs  and  textiles;  by  the 
mid-1970s  and  1980s,  heavy,  defense,  and  chemical  industries  had 
become  predominant.  While  these  activities  were  important  in  the 
early  1990s,  real  growth  was  occurring  in  the  electronics  and  high- 
technology  industries.  The  chaebol  also  were  responsible  for  turn- 
ing the  trade  deficit  in  1985  to  a  trade  surplus  in  1986.  The  cur- 
rent account  balance,  however,  fell  from  more  than  US$14  billion 
in  1988  to  US$5  billion  in  1989. 

The  chaebol  continued  their  explosive  growth  in  export  markets 
in  the  1980s.  By  the  late  1980s,  the  chaebol  had  become  financially 
independent  and  secure — thereby  eliminating  the  need  for  further 
government-sponsored  credit  and  assistance.  By  1990  the  chaebol 
also  had  begun  to  produce  for  a  growing  domestic  market. 

The  chaebol  were  powerful  independent  entities  acting  in  the  econ- 
omy and  politics,  but  sometimes  they  cooperated  with  the  govern- 
ment in  the  areas  of  planning  and  innovation.  The  government 
worked  hard  to  encourage  competition  among  the  chaebol  in  cer- 
tain areas  and  to  avoid  total  monopolies. 

Another  reason  for  the  success  of  the  chaebol  was  their  access  to 
foreign  technology.  Rather  than  having  to  develop  new  areas 
through  research  and  technology,  South  Korean  firms  could  pur- 
chase foreign  patents  and  technology  and  produce  the  same  goods 
made  elsewhere  at  lower  costs.  Hyundai  cars,  for  example,  used 
an  engine  developed  by  the  Mitsubishi  Corporation  of  Japan. 

The  role  of  big  business  extended  to  the  political  arena.  In  1988 
a  member  of  a  chaebol  family,  Chong  Mong-jun,  president  of  Hyun- 
dai Heavy  Industries,  successfully  ran  for  the  National  Assembly. 
Other  business  leaders  also  were  chosen  to  be  members  of  the  Na- 
tional Assembly  through  the  proportional  representation  system. 

The  Role  of  Public  Enterprise 

A  government-led  economic  development  policy  during  the  1960s 
was  necessary  because  the  less  experienced  and  capital-poor  pri- 
vate entrepreneurs  lacked  the  wherewithal  to  develop  several  crit- 
ical industries  that  were  necessary  to  the  nation's  economic  growth. 
The  government  determined  that  establishing  public  corporations 
to  develop  and  manage  these  highly  strategic  industries  was  the 
fastest  and  most  efficient  way  to  foster  growth  in  a  variety  of  key 
areas. 

During  the  1960s,  public  enterprises  were  concentrated  in  such 
areas  as  electrification,  banking,  communications,  and  manufac- 
turing. In  1990  these  enterprises  were,  in  many  cases,  efficient 


149 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

revenue-producing  concerns  that  produced  essential  goods  and  ser- 
vices at  low  costs,  but  which  also  produced  profits  that  were  used 
for  new  capital  investments  or  to  produce  funds  for  public  use  else- 
where. In  the  1980s,  Seoul  was  slowly  privatizing  a  number  of  these 
firms  by  selling  stocks,  but  the  government  remained  the  principal 
stockholder  in  each  company.  In  the  1980s,  an  important  func- 
tion of  public  enterprises  was  the  introduction  of  new  and  expen- 
sive technology  ventures. 

In  1985  the  public  enterprise  sector  consisted  of  about  90  enter- 
prises employing  305,000  workers,  or  2.7  percent  of  total  employ- 
ment in  the  nonagricultural  sector.  There  were  four  categories  of 
public  enterprises:  government  enterprises  (staffed  and  run  by 
government  officials),  government-invested  enterprises  (with  at  least 
50  percent  government  ownership),  subsidiaries  of  government- 
invested  enterprises  (usually  having  indirect  government  funding), 
and  other  government-backed  enterprises.  Government-invested 
public  enterprises,  such  as  the  Korea  Electric  Power  Corporation 
(KEPCO)  and  the  Pohang  Iron  and  Steel  Company  (POSCO), 
represented  the  core  of  the  new  enterprises  established  during  Park's 
regime.  In  the  late  1980s,  roughly  30  percent  of  the  revenues 
produced  by  public  enterprises  came  from  the  manufacturing  sec- 
tor and  the  other  70  percent  from  such  service  sectors  as  the  elec- 
trical, communications,  and  financial  industries. 

Pohang  Iron  and  Steel  Company 

In  the  1960s,  the  Park  government  concluded  that  self-sufficiency 
in  steel  and  the  construction  of  an  integrated  steelworks  were  es- 
sential to  economic  development.  Because  South  Korea  had  not 
had  a  modern  steel  plant  before  1968,  many  foreign  and  domestic 
businesses  were  skeptical  of  Seoul's  decision  to  invest  heavily  in 
constructing  a  steel  plant.  Despite  the  skepticism,  however,  POSCO 
began  production  in  1972,  just  four  years  after  the  company's  in- 
auguration in  April  1968  with  only  thirty-nine  employees. 

Japan  provided  the  money  for  the  construction  of  the  initial  plant, 
following  an  agreement  made  at  the  Third  South  Korea-Japan 
Ministerial  Meeting  in  1969.  Financing  included  US$73.7  million 
in  government  grants  and  loans,  US$50  million  in  credit  from  the 
Japan  Export-Import  Bank,  and  technical  assistance  from  Nippon 
Steel  and  other  corporations.  This  cooperation  was  one  consequence 
of  the  normalization  of  relations  with  Japan  in  1965  and  reflected 
the  view  of  the  government  of  Japan  as  noted  in  the  Nixon-Sato 
communique  of  November  21,  1969,  that  "the  security  of  the 
Republic  of  Korea  is  essential  to  the  security  of  Japan."

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

POSCO  is  located  in  the  southeastern  port  city  of  P'ohang.  Previ- 
ously a  fishing  port  whose  major  industry  was  processing  fish  and 
marine  products,  P'ohang  is  now  a  major  industrial  center  with 
almost  250,000  people.  In  addition  to  the  huge  integrated  steel  mill, 
P'ohang  has  an  industrial  complex  housing  companies  that 
manufacture  finished  steel  products  of  raw  materials  provided  by 
POSCO. 

POSCO  first  began  to  sell  plate  products  in  1972  and  focused 
its  sales  policies  on  the  domestic  market  to  improve  steel  self- 
sufficiency  at  home.  Special  efforts  were  made  to  supply  quality 
iron  and  steel  to  related  domestic  companies  at  below  export  price 
to  strengthen  their  international  competitiveness. 

POSCO's  growth  has  been  immense.  By  the  late  1980s,  POSCO 
was  the  fifth  biggest  steel  company  in  the  noncommunist  world, 
with  an  annual  production  approaching  12  million  tons  worth  3 
trillion  won.  The  further  expansion  of  POSCO's  productivity  and 
size,  however,  was  sought  at  a  time  when  the  steel  industries  of 
the  United  States  and  Japan  were  declining.  POSCO's  second- 
phase  mill  at  Kwangyang  was  completed  in  August  1988.  A  third- 
phase  mill  was  expected,  by  the  early  1990s,  to  further  increase 
crude  steel  production  to  a  total  output  of  approximately  17.2  mil- 
lion tons  a  year.  In  terms  of  productivity,  POSCO  was  rated  the 
world's  best  steel  manufacturer  throughout  the  late  1980s  and  also 
was  rated  at  the  top  in  terms  of  facilities. 

In  1987  Seoul  announced  that  it  was  going  to  transform  POSCO 
into  a  private  company  in  line  with  the  government's  new  policy 
of  privatizing  state-run  corporations.  The  government  planned  to 
retain  a  majority  share  of  the  stock;  initial  reports  in  the  South 
Korean  press  in  1988  indicated  that  the  sale  of  public  shares  was 
going  slower  than  anticipated. 

Korea  Electric  Power  Corporation 

KEPCO  is  a  government  agency  whose  goal  is  to  provide  abun- 
dant electric  power  and  to  develop  reliable  power  resources.  The 
south  of  Korea  traditionally  had  received  its  electric  power  from 
power  stations  in  present-day  North  Korea,  but  the  Pyongyang 
government  cut  off  power  to  South  Korea  in  1948.  The  catastrophes 
of  the  Korean  War  also  posed  electrical  supply  problems.  The  sit- 
uation had  not  improved  greatly  by  1961  when  the  new  military 
junta  merged  three  smaller  electric  companies  to  form  the  Korea 
Electric  Company  (KECO).  Seoul  invested  heavily  in  KECO, 
realizing  that  adequate  sources  of  power  were  a  basic  prerequisite 
to  industrialization.  In  1982  KECO  was  reorganized  as  a  public 
corporation  and  became  known  as  KEPCO.  All  shares  were  owned 


152 


The  Economy 


by  the  government.  In  1988  Seoul  decided  to  sell  30  percent  of  all 
shares  to  the  public. 

KEPCO,  one  of  the  largest  public  corporations  in  South  Korea, 
with  30,289  employees,  serviced  about  99.8  percent  of  the  populace 
in  1988.  It  derived  about  12  percent  of  its  electricity  from  hydro- 
electric sources,  50  percent  from  thermal  sources  (coal,  oil,  and 
gas-fired),  and  the  rest  from  a  growing  number  of  nuclear  power 
plants.  It  was  hoped  that  nuclear  power  would  be  developed  fur- 
ther to  lower  reliance  on  oil,  gas,  and  coal  imports.  KEPCO  offi- 
cials pronounced  their  nuclear  power  plants  safe  from  any  potential 
nonmilitary  accidents  and  said  that  extraordinary  measures  had 
been  taken  to  protect  the  plants  in  case  of  a  North  Korean  attack. 

Financing  Development 

Financing  South  Korea's  economic  development  in  the  1990s 
was  expected  to  differ  from  previous  decades  in  two  main  respects: 
greater  reliance  on  domestic  sources  and  more  emphasis  on  equity 
relative  to  debt.  Beginning  in  the  1960s,  foreign  credit  was  used 
to  finance  development,  but  the  amount  of  foreign  debt  had 
decreased  since  the  mid-1980s.  According  to  the  Sixth  Five- Year 
Economic  and  Social  Development  Plan  (1987-91),  an  average  an- 
nual growth  rate  of  8  percent  was  expected,  together  with  account 
surpluses  of  about  US$5  billion  a  year  through  1991. 

To  realize  these  growth  targets,  South  Koreans  needed  the  gross 
domestic  savings  rate  to  exceed  the  domestic  investment  rate;  ad- 
ditionally, they  needed  the  financing  of  future  economic  growth 
to  come  entirely  from  domestic  sources.  Such  a  situation  would 
involve  reducing  foreign  debt  by  US$2  billion  a  year;  and  South 
Korea  would  become  a  net  creditor  nation  in  the  mid-1990s. 
Through  the  promotion  and  reform  of  the  securities  markets,  es- 
pecially the  stock  market,  and  increased  foreign  investment,  the 
sixth  plan  encouraged  the  diversification  of  sources  and  types  of 
corporate  finance,  especially  equity  finance. 

Domestic  savings  were  very  low  before  the  mid-1960s,  equiva- 
lent to  less  than  2  percent  of  GNP  in  the  1960  to  1962  period.  The 
savings  rate  jumped  to  10  percent  between  1970  and  1972  when 
banks  began  offering  depositors  rates  of  20  percent  or  more  on  sav- 
ings accounts.  This  situation  allowed  banks  to  compete  effectively 
for  deposits  with  unorganized  money  markets  that  had  previously 
offered  higher  rates  than  the  banks.  The  savings  rate  increased  to 
16.8  percent  of  GNP  in  1975  and  28  percent  in  1979,  but  tem- 
porarily plunged  to  20.8  percent  in  1980  because  of  the  oil  price 
rise.  After  1980,  as  incomes  rose,  so  did  the  savings  rate.  The 
surge  of  the  savings  rate  to  36.3  percent  in  1987  and  35.8  percent  in 


153 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


1989  reflected  the  sharp  growth  of  GNP  in  the  1980s.  The  prospects 
for  continued  high  rates  of  saving  were  associated  with  continued 
high  GNP  growth,  which  nevertheless  declined  to  6.5  percent  in 
1989. 

According  to  Donald  S.  Macdonald,  through  the  early  1980s 
funds  for  investment  came  primarily  from  bilateral  government 
loans  (mainly  from  the  United  States  and  Japan),  international  lend- 
ing organizations,  and  commercial  banks.  In  the  late  1980s, 
however,  domestic  savings  accounted  for  two-thirds  or  more  of  total 
investment. 

Throughout  the  1980s,  the  financial  sector  underwent  signifi- 
cant expansion,  diversification  of  products  and  services,  and  struc- 
tural changes  brought  about  by  economic  liberalization  policies. 
As  noted  by  Park  Yung-chul,  financial  liberalization  eased  interest 
ceilings.  Deregulation  increased  competition  in  financial  markets, 
which  in  turn  accelerated  product  diversification.  In  the  early  1980s, 
securities  companies  were  permitted  to  sell  securities  through  a 
repurchase  agreement.  By  1985  banks  also  were  allowed  to  engage 
in  the  repurchase  agreements  of  government  and  public  bonds.  In 
1981  finance  and  investment  corporations  started  dealing  in  large- 
denomination  commercial  paper.  The  new  form  of  commercial 
paper  was  issued  in  minimum  denominations  of  10  million  won, 
compared  to  the  previous  minimum  value  for  commercial  paper 
of  1  million  won. 

In  order  to  extend  their  ability  to  raise  cash,  investment  and 
finance  companies  introduced  a  new  cash-management  account  with 
a  4  million  won  minimum  deposit  in  1983.  Investment  and  finance 
corporations  managed  client  funds  by  investing  them  in  commer- 
cial paper  corporate  bonds  and  certificates  of  deposit.  Money- 
deposit  banks  in  the  mid-1980s  began  offering  similar  accounts, 
known  as  household  money-in- trust.  Trust  business  formerly  had 
been  the  exclusive  domain  of  the  Bank  of  Seoul  and  Trust  Com- 
pany; however,  after  1983  all  money-deposit  banks  were  autho- 
rized to  offer  trust  services. 

The  financial  system  underwent  two  major  structural  changes 
in  the  late  1970s  and  1980s.  First,  money-deposit  banks  saw  a  sus- 
tained erosion  of  their  once-dominant  market  position  (from  80 
percent  in  the  1970  to  1974  period  to  55  percent  by  1984).  One 
reason  for  this  decline  was  that  in  the  1970s  nonbank  financial  in- 
termediaries, such  as  investment  trust  corporations,  finance  com- 
panies, and  merchant  banking  corporations,  were  given  preferential 
treatment.  Further,  because  the  costs  of  intermediation  at  these 
nonbank  financial  institutions  were  lower  than  at  banks  (with  their 
many  branches  nationwide  and  their  multitudes  of  small  savers  and 


154 


The  Economy 


borrowers),  their  cost  advantages  and  higher  lending  rates  allowed 
them  a  larger  market  share. 

The  second  structural  change  was  the  rapid  increase  of  commer- 
cial paper  and  corporate  debenture  markets.  Another  development 
was  the  steady  growth  of  investment  trust  corporations  in  the  1980s. 

Because  of  the  introduction  of  tax  and  financing  incentives  by 
the  government  that  encouraged  companies  to  list  their  shares  on 
the  stock  market,  the  Korean  Stock  Exchange  grew  rapidly  in  the 
late  1980s.  In  1987  more  than  350  companies  were  listed  on  the 
exchange.  There  was  an  average  daily  trading  volume  of  10  mil- 
lion shares,  with  a  turnover  ratio  of  80  percent.  In  1989  the  stock 
market  was  tarnished  by  accusations  of  insider  trading  among  the 
five  major  South  Korean  securities  firms.  The  Securities  and  Ex- 
change Commission  launched  an  investigation  in  late  1989.  The 
popular  index  of  the  market  soared  to  a  high  of  1,007.77  points 
on  April  1,  1989,  but  plunged  back  to  the  800s  in  late  1989  and 
early  1990. 

Business  financing  was  obtained  primarily  through  bank  loans 
or  borrowing  on  the  informal  and  high-interest  "curb  market"  of 
private  lenders.  The  curb  market  served  individuals  who  needed 
cash  urgently,  less  reputable  businesspeople  who  engaged  in  specu- 
lation, and  the  multitudes  of  smaller  companies  that  needed  oper- 
ating funds  but  could  not  procure  bank  financing.  The  loans  they 
received,  often  in  exchange  for  weak  collateral,  had  very  high  in- 
terest rates.  The  curb  market  played  a  critical  role  in  the  1960s 
and  1970s  in  pumping  money  into  the  economy  and  in  assisting 
the  growth  of  smaller  corporations.  The  curb  market  continued 
to  exist,  along  with  the  formal  banking  system,  through  the  1980s. 

Industry 

The  growth  of  the  industrial  sector  was  the  principal  stimulus 
to  economic  development.  In  1987  manufacturing  industries  ac- 
counted for  approximately  30  percent  of  the  gross  domestic  product 
(GDP — see  Glossary)  and  25  percent  of  the  work  force.  Benefit- 
ing from  strong  domestic  encouragement  and  foreign  aid,  Seoul's 
industrialists  introduced  modern  technologies  into  outmoded  or 
newly  built  facilities  at  a  rapid  pace,  increased  the  production  of 
commodities — especially  those  for  sale  in  foreign  markets — and 
plowed  the  proceeds  back  into  further  industrial  expansion.  As  a 
result,  industry  altered  the  country's  landscape,  drawing  millions 
of  laborers  to  urban  manufacturing  centers. 

A  downturn  in  the  South  Korean  economy  in  1989  spurred  by 
a  sharp  decrease  in  exports  and  foreign  orders  caused  deep  concern 
in  the  industrial  sector.  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry  analysts 


155 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

stated  that  poor  export  performance  resulted  from  structural 
problems  embedded  in  the  nation's  economy,  including  an  overly 
strong  won,  increased  wages  and  high  labor  costs,  frequent  strikes, 
and  high  interest  rates.  The  result  was  an  increase  in  inventories 
and  severe  cutbacks  in  production  at  a  number  of  electronics,  auto- 
mobile, and  textile  manufacturers,  as  well  as  at  the  smaller  firms 
that  supplied  the  parts.  Factory  automation  systems  were  introduced 
to  reduce  dependence  on  labor,  to  boost  productivity  with  a  much 
smaller  work  force,  and  to  improve  competitiveness.  It  was  esti- 
mated that  over  two- thirds  of  South  Korea's  manufacturers  spent 
over  half  of  the  funds  available  for  facility  investments  on  auto- 
mation. 

In  1990  South  Korean  manufacturers  planned  a  significant  shift 
in  future  production  plans  toward  high-technology  industries.  In 
June  1989,  panels  of  government  officials,  scholars,  and  business 
leaders  held  planning  sessions  on  the  production  of  such  goods  as 
new  materials,  mechatronics — including  industrial  robotics,  bioen- 
gineering,  microelectronics,  fine  chemistry,  and  aerospace.  This 
shift  in  emphasis,  however,  did  not  mean  an  immediate  decline 
in  heavy  industries  such  as  automobile  and  ship  production,  which 
had  dominated  the  economy  in  the  1980s. 

Except  for  mining,  most  industries  were  located  in  the  urban 
areas  of  the  northwest  and  southeast.  Heavy  industries  generally 
were  located  in  the  south  of  the  country.  Factories  in  Seoul  con- 
tributed over  25  percent  of  all  manufacturing  value-added  in  1978; 
taken  together  with  factories  in  surrounding  Kyonggi  Province, 
factories  in  the  Seoul  area  produced  46  percent  of  all  manufactur- 
ing that  year.  Factories  in  Seoul  and  Kyonggi  Province  employed 
48  percent  of  the  nation's  2.1  million  factory  workers. 

Steel 

In  1989  South  Korea  was  the  world's  tenth  largest  steel  producer, 
accounting  for  2.3  percent  of  world  steel  production.  South  Korea 
continued  to  expand  crude  steel  production — 19.3  million  tons  for 
1988,  up  14.9  percent  over  1987.  Domestic  demand  for  steel 
products  increased  8.5  percent  from  15  million  tons  to  16.3  mil- 
lion tons  over  the  same  period  because  of  the  growing  demands 
of  South  Korean  industry.  Domestic  demand  accounted  for  70  per- 
cent of  the  total,  mostly  because  of  the  increased  needs  of  such  steel- 
consuming  industries  as  automobiles,  shipbuilding,  and  electronics. 

The  steel  industry  grew  in  the  1970s  after  the  government  con- 
structed the  POSCO  mill  to  service  Seoul's  rapidly  growing  au- 
tomobile, shipbuilding,  and  construction  industries.  In  1988  South 
Korea's  steel  industry  included  200  steel  companies.  Iron  and  steel 


156 


The  Economy 


production  was  expected  to  increase  in  the  early  1990s,  given  the 
output  increases  in  domestic  user  industries.  Exports  were  likely 
to  be  flat  or  to  decline  because  of  decreased  international  demand. 

Electronics 

In  1989  South  Korea  was  a  major  producer  of  electronics,  produc- 
ing color  televisions,  videocassette  recorders,  microwave  ovens,  ra- 
dios, watches,  personal  computers,  and  videotapes.  In  1988  the 
electronics  industry  produced  US$23  billion  worth  of  goods  (up 
35  percent  from  1987),  to  become  the  world's  sixth  largest  manufac- 
turer. The  total  value  of  parts  and  components  (including  semi- 
conductors) produced  in  1988  totaled  US$9.7  billion,  overtaking 
consumer  electronics  production  (US$9.2  billion)  for  the  first  time. 
Manufacture  of  industrial  electronics  also  grew  significantly  in  1988 
and  totaled  US$4.6  billion  (20  percent  of  total  production).  Elec- 
tronics exports  grew  rapidly  in  the  late  1980s  to  more  than  US$15 
billion  in  1988,  up  40  percent  from  1987 — to  become  Seoul's  leading 
export  industry.  Although  South  Korean  electronic  goods  enjoyed 
substantial  price  competitiveness  over  Japanese  products,  the  elec- 
tronics industry  continued  to  be  heavily  dependent  on  Japanese 
components,  an  important  factor  in  South  Korea's  chronic  trade 
deficit  with  Japan.  Some  South  Korean  firms  formed  joint  ven- 
tures with  foreign  concerns  to  acquire  advanced  technology.  In  the 
late  1980s,  South  Korea's  leading  electronics  firms  (Samsung, 
Lucky-Goldstar,  and  Hyundai)  began  establishing  overseas  plants 
in  such  markets  as  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West  Ger- 
many), Britain,  Turkey,  and  Ireland. 

By  1 990  significant  shifts  were  occurring  within  the  electronics 
industry.  In  1989  South  Korea  had  lost  some  of  its  cost  advantage 
to  newer  consumer  electronics  producers  in  Southeast  Asia.  At  the 
same  time,  production  of  electronic  components  and  of  industrial 
electronics,  particularly  computers  and  telecommunications  equip- 
ment, continued  to  expand  to  such  an  extent  that  overall  demand 
for  South  Korean  electronics  products  was  expected  to  increase 
modesdy  in  the  early  1990s.  In  1990  Seoul  projected  that  the  micro- 
electronics industry  would  grow  at  an  annual  rate  of  17.2  percent 
in  the  early  1990s. 

Shipbuilding 

During  the  1970s  and  1980s,  South  Korea  became  a  leading 
producer  of  ships,  including  oil  supertankers,  and  oil-drilling  plat- 
forms. The  country's  major  shipbuilder  was  Hyundai,  which  built 
a  1 -million-ton  capacity  drydock  at  Ulsan  in  the  mid-1970s.  Daewoo 


157 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

joined  the  shipbuilding  industry  in  1980  and  finished  a  1 .2-million- 
ton  facility  at  Okp'o  on  Koje  Island,  south  of  Pusan,  in  mid-1981 . 
The  industry  declined  in  the  mid-1980s  because  of  the  oil  glut  and 
because  of  a  worldwide  recession.  There  was  a  sharp  decrease  in 
new  orders  in  the  late  1980s;  new  orders  for  1988  totaled  3  million 
gross  tons  valued  at  US$1.9  billion,  decreases  from  the  previous 
year  of  17.8  percent  and  4.4  percent,  respectively.  These  declines 
were  caused  by  labor  unrest,  Seoul's  unwillingness  to  provide  finan- 
cial assistance,  and  Tokyo's  new  low-interest  export  financing  in 
support  of  Japanese  shipbuilders.  However,  the  South  Korean  ship- 
ping industry  was  expected  to  expand  in  the  early  1990s  because 
older  ships  in  world  fleets  needed  replacing. 

Automobiles  and  Automotive  Parts 

The  automobile  industry  was  one  of  South  Korea's  major  growth 
and  export  industries  in  the  1980s.  By  the  late  1980s,  the  capacity 
of  the  South  Korean  motor  industry  had  increased  more  than 
fivefold  since  1984;  it  exceeded  1  million  units  in  1988.  Total  in- 
vestment in  car  and  car-component  manufacturing  was  over  US$3 
billion  in  1989.  Total  production  (including  buses  and  trucks)  for 
1988  totaled  1.1  million  units,  a  10.6  percent  increase  over  1987, 
and  grew  to  an  estimated  1.3  million  vehicles  (predominantly  pas- 
senger cars)  in  1989.  Almost  263,000  passenger  cars  were  produced 
in  1985 — a  figure  that  grew  to  approximately  846,000  units  in  1989. 
In  1988  automobile  exports  totaled  576,134  units,  of  which  480,119 
units  (83.3  percent)  were  sent  to  the  United  States.  Throughout 
most  of  the  late  1980s,  much  of  the  growth  of  South  Korea's  auto- 
mobile industry  was  the  result  of  a  surge  in  exports;  1989  exports, 
however,  declined  28.5  percent  from  1988.  This  decline  reflected 
sluggish  car  sales  to  the  United  States,  especially  at  the  less  expen- 
sive end  of  the  market,  and  labor  strife  at  home. 

The  industry  continued  to  grow,  however,  because  of  a  surge 
in  domestic  demand,  up  47  percent  during  the  first  half  of  1989. 
In  1989,  for  the  first  time  since  car  exports  had  doubled  in  1985, 
domestic  sales  surpassed  exports;  two-thirds  of  the  cars  manufac- 
tured were  sold  domestically.  Most  of  the  domestic  demand  came 
from  first-time  car  buyers  whose  savings  had  been  buoyed  by 
double-digit  wage  increases  each  year  since  1987.  Other  factors  lead- 
ing to  the  growing  domestic  demand  for  motor  vehicles  included 
stable  or  slightly  decreased  new  car  prices  because  of  cuts  in  spe- 
cial consumption  taxes,  reduced  fuel  taxes,  and  growing  econo- 
mies of  scale  by  manufacturers. 

Throughout  the  1970s  and  1980s,  the  automobile  industry  was 
subject  to  a  series  of  government  controls  and  directives  designed 


158

159 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

to  nurture  the  industry  and  prevent  excess  competition.  For  most 
of  the  1980s,  Hyundai  was  the  only  company  permitted  to  manufac- 
ture passenger  cars,  but  in  1989  Kia  Motors  and  Daewoo  were 
allowed  to  reenter  the  passenger  car  business.  In  1989  Ssangyong 
Motors  became  South  Korea's  fourth  car  manufacturer. 

South  Korea's  auto  parts  industry  grew  rapidly  in  the  late  1980s, 
from  US$3.8  billion  in  1987  to  US$4.6  billion  in  1988  (US$4  bil- 
lion produced  locally).  Automotive  parts  imports,  most  of  which 
came  from  Japan,  totaled  US$610  million  in  1988  (down  from 
US$700  million  in  1987).  In  1989  South  Korean  automobile  and 
parts  manufacturers  planned  to  spend  more  than  2  trillion  won 
(US$2.8  billion)  on  facility  expansion,  research,  and  development. 

Armaments 

South  Korea  is  an  important  manufacturer  of  armaments,  both 
for  domestic  use  and  for  export  (see  Military  Production,  ch.  5). 
During  the  1960s,  South  Korea  was  largely  dependent  on  the  United 
States  to  supply  its  armed  forces,  but  after  the  elaboration  of  Presi- 
dent Richard  M.  Nixon's  policy  of  Vietnamization  in  the  early 
1970s,  South  Korea  began  to  manufacture  many  of  its  own 
weapons.  These  included  M-16  rifles,  artillery,  ammunition,  tanks, 
other  military  vehicles,  and  ships.  Aircraft  were  assembled  under 
coproduction  arrangements  with  United  States  firms.  Arms  exports, 
including  quartermaster  goods,  vehicles,  and  weaponry,  reached 
nearly  US$975  million  in  1982  but  declined  during  the  rest  of  the 
decade,  reaching  only  US$50  million  in  1988.  In  1989  Seoul  an- 
nounced that  its  fledgling  aerospace  industry  was  planning  to 
produce  an  indigenously  designed  high-performance  jetfighter  for 
its  air  force  within  two  decades.  The  South  Korean  aerospace  in- 
dustry also  developed  a  Korean  Fighters  Program  in  cooperation 
with  McDonnell  Douglas  of  the  United  States,  with  the  goal  of  "ac- 
quiring the  capacity  to  design  and  manufacture  supersonic  jet- 
fighters." 

Construction 

Construction  has  been  an  important  South  Korean  export  in- 
dustry since  the  early  1960s  and  remains  a  critical  source  of  for- 
eign currency  and  "invisible"  export  earnings.  By  1981  overseas 
construction  projects,  most  of  them  in  the  Middle  East,  accounted 
for  60  percent  of  the  work  undertaken  by  South  Korean  construc- 
tion companies.  Contracts  that  year  were  valued  at  US$13.7  bil- 
lion. In  1988,  however,  overseas  construction  contracts  totaled  only 
US$1 .6  billion  (orders  from  the  Middle  East  were  US$1 .2  billion), 
a  1  percent  increase  over  the  previous  year,  while  new  orders  for 


160 


The  Economy 


domestic  construction  projects  totaled  US$13.8  billion,  an  8.8  per- 
cent increase  over  1987.  The  result  was  that  South  Korean  con- 
struction companies  concentrated  on  the  rapidly  growing  domestic 
market  in  the  late  1980s.  By  1989  there  were  signs  of  a  revival  of 
the  overseas  construction  market — the  Dong  Ah  Construction  Com- 
pany signed  a  US$5.3  billion  contract  with  Libya  for  the  second 
phase  of  Libya's  Great  Man-Made  River  Project,  which,  when  all 
five  phases  were  completed,  was  projected  to  cost  US$27  billion. 
South  Korean  construction  companies  signed  over  US$7  billion 
of  overseas  contracts  in  1989. 

Textiles  and  Footwear 

Textiles,  clothing,  and  leather  products  made  up  about  24  per- 
cent of  South  Korea's  manufacturing  output  in  1980.  Over  10,000 
textile  and  footwear  enterprises  employed  more  than  four  workers 
each,  and  34,000  smaller  shops  manufactured  such  products  in 
1978.  Throughout  the  1980s,  textiles  played  a  critical  role  in  Seoul's 
exports,  accounting  for  US$11.9  billion,  or  19.6  percent  of  total 
export  earnings.  In  1989  the  export  of  textiles  (valued  at  US$15,340 
million)  grew  8.5  percent  over  the  1988  level.  Textile  manufac- 
turers, concerned  about  diminishing  export  competitiveness  because 
of  wage  increases  and  won  revaluation,  expanded  their  overseas 
investments  in  1987  and  1988.  Seoul  approved  sixty-six  investment 
projects  totaling  US$38.4  million  from  January  1,  1978,  through 
the  end  of  September  1988.  Most  of  these  investments  were  locat- 
ed in  the  Caribbean  Basin  region  and  Southeast  Asia.  Upgrading 
product  lines — particularly  towards  high  fashion — and  further  shift- 
ing to  the  expanding  domestic  market  were  expected  to  cause  slow 
growth  in  the  industry  in  the  early  1990s. 

South  Korea's  footwear  industry  also  expanded  in  the  late  1980s. 
Footwear  exports  in  1988  totaled  US$3.8  billion,  a  34.7  percent 
increase  over  1987,  6.3  percent  of  Seoul's  total  exports  by  value. 
Economic  forecasters,  however,  predicted  that  the  industry  would 
decline  in  the  1990s  despite  the  surge  of  orders  in  1989;  they  at- 
tributed the  1989  surge  to  political  unrest  in  China,  normally  a 
major  producer  of  footwear. 

Chemicals 

The  chemical  industry  began  full  production  in  the  1970s. 
Although  dependent  on  imports  of  raw  materials  and  certain  high- 
technology  commodities,  the  chemical  industry  supplied  many  of 
the  intermediate  inputs  for  textile,  plastic,  synthetic  rubber,  rub- 
ber shoe,  and  paint  factories,  and  had  made  South  Korea  virtually 
self-sufficient  in  fertilizers.  The  chemical  fertilizer  industry,  a 


161 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

large  part  of  the  chemical  industry,  met  most  of  South  Korea's 
domestic  consumption  demands. 

In  1987  chemical  and  pharmaceutical  exports  increased  by  27 
percent  over  the  previous  year,  but  accounted  for  only  2.8  percent 
of  total  exports;  imports  in  that  category  comprised  11.2  percent 
of  total  imports.  The  chemical  industry  was  expected  to  expand 
in  the  early  1990s,  with  new  capacity  coming  online  and  Seoul  com- 
mitted to  spending  money  for  research  and  development  and  con- 
structing new  production  facilities.  Pharmaceuticals,  agricultural 
chemicals,  dyes,  pigments,  paint,  perfumes,  surface  active  agents 
(surfactants)  including  synthetic  detergents,  and  catalysts  were  tar- 
geted as  major  areas  for  investment. 

In  the  late  1980s,  petrochemical  production  facilities  included 
twenty-five  companies,  thirty-six  plants,  two  naphtha  crackers,  and 
three  aromatics  extraction  plants,  with  an  aggregate  total  produc- 
tion capacity  of  505,000  tons  of  ethylene  per  annum.  There  were 
two  large  petrochemical  complexes,  one  in  Ulsan,  the  other  in  Yosu. 
South  Korea  was  an  important  producer  of  chemical  fertilizers  in 
the  late  1970s  (671,000  nutrient  tons  exported  in  1980),  but  both 
exports  and  production  declined  in  the  1980s. 

Energy 

The  Korean  Peninsula  is  only  modestly  endowed  with  natural 
resources,  and  North  Korea  has  far  more  natural  resources  than 
South  Korea.  During  the  Japanese  colonial  period  (1910-45),  the 
north  served  as  the  center  for  mining  and  industry  whereas  the 
south,  with  somewhat  greater  rainfall,  a  warmer  climate,  and  slight- 
ly greater  arable  terrain,  served  as  the  center  for  rice  production, 
(see  Physical  Environment,  ch.  2). 

South  Korea's  mineral  production  is  not  adequate  to  supply  its 
manufacturing  output.  Energy  needs  are  also  met  by  importing 
bituminous  and  anthracite  coal  and  crude  petroleum.  In  1987  ap- 
proximately 23.4  million  tons  of  anthracite  coal,  approximately 
4,000  tons  of  tungsten,  565,000  tons  of  iron  ore,  and  47,000  tons 
of  zinc  ore  were  mined.  Lesser  amounts  of  copper,  lead,  molybde- 
num, gold,  silver,  kaolin,  and  fluorite  also  were  mined  (see  fig.  9). 

Energy  producers  were  dominated  by  government  enterprises, 
although  privately  operated  coal  mines  and  oil  refineries  also  ex- 
isted. In  1990  South  Korea  still  had  no  proven  oil  reserves.  Off- 
shore oil  possibilities  in  the  Yellow  Sea  and  on  the  continental  shelf 
between  Korea  and  Japan  yielded  nothing  through  the  1980s,  but 
exploration  continued.  South  Korea's  coal  supply  was  both  insuffi- 
cient and  of  low  quality.  The  potential  for  hydroelectric  power  was 
very  limited  because  of  tremendous  seasonal  variations  in  the

weather  and  the  concentration  of  most  of  the  rainfall  in  the  sum- 
mer months.  Accordingly,  Seoul  placed  an  increasingly  heavy  em- 
phasis on  developing  nuclear  power  generation. 

Electric  power  in  South  Korea  was  provided  by  the  Korea  Elec- 
tric Power  Corporation  (KEPCO).  When  KEPCO's  predecessor, 
KECO,  was  founded  in  1961,  annual  power  production  was  1,770 
million  kilowatt-hours  (kwhr);  production  reached  73,992  million 
kwhr  in  1987.  The  ratio  of  usage  during  1987  was  17.9  percent 
for  residential  customers,  16.2  percent  for  public  and  service  busi- 
nesses, and  65.9  percent  for  the  industrial  sector.  Energy  used  in 
electric  power  generation  consisted  primarily  of  nuclear,  coal,  oil, 
and  liquified  natural  gas  (LNG).  Of  the  54,885  million  kwhr  of 
electricity  generated  in  1985,  22  percent  came  from  nuclear  plants 
then  in  operation,  74  percent  from  thermal  plants  (oil  and  coal), 
and  4  percent  from  hydroelectric  sites.  It  was  predicted  in  1988 
that  the  generation  structure  by  the  year  2000  would  be  10.2  per- 
cent hydroelectric,  12.2  percent  oil,  22.9  percent  coal,  10.2  per- 
cent LNG,  and  44.5  percent  nuclear. 

South  Korea  placed  a  heavy  emphasis  on  nuclear  power  gener- 
ation. The  country's  first  nuclear  power  plant,  the  Kori  Number 
One  located  near  Pusan,  opened  in  1977.  Eight  plants  were  oper- 
ational in  1987  when  atomic  power  generation  was  an  estimated 
71,158  million  kilowatts,  or  53.1  percent  of  total  electric  power. 

South  Korea's  first  antinuclear  protests  occurred  in  December 
1988  when  residents  near  the  Kori  complex  demonstrated  against 
low-level  waste  that  had  been  secretly  buried  just  outside  the  plant. 
In  1989  residents  near  other  nuclear  reactors  protested  the  environ- 
mental damage  they  said  was  caused  by  the  units.  Sixteen  antinuclear 
groups  joined  together  to  form  the  Movement  for  the  Eradication 
of  Nuclear  Power  Plants.  The  government,  however,  asserted  that 
the  South  Korean  nuclear  program  was  well  run  and  that  none 
of  the  193  antinuclear  protests  reported  since  1977  was  serious. 

Agriculture 

At  the  start  of  the  economic  boom  in  1963,  the  majority  of  South 
Koreans  were  farmers.  Sixty-three  percent  of  the  population  lived 
in  rural  areas.  In  the  next  twenty-five  years,  South  Korea  grew 
from  a  predominandy  rural,  agricultural  nation  into  an  urban,  new- 
ly industrialized  country  and  the  agricultural  workforce  shrunk  to 
only  21  percent  in  1989  (see  fig.  10).  Government  officials  expected 
that  urbanization  and  industrialization  would  further  reduce  the 
number  of  agricultural  workers  to  well  under  20  percent  by  2000. 

South  Korea's  agriculture  had  many  inherent  problems.  South 
Korea  is  a  mountainous  country  with  only  22  percent  arable  land

and  less  rainfall  than  most  other  neighboring  rice-growing  coun- 
tries (see  Land  Area  and  Borders;  Climate,  ch.  2).  A  major  land 
reform  in  the  late  1940s  and  early  1950s  spread  ownership  of  land 
to  the  rural  peasantry.  Individual  holdings,  however,  were  too  small 
(averaging  one  hectare,  which  made  cultivation  inefficient  and  dis- 
couraged mechanization)  or  too  spread  out  to  provide  families  with 
much  chance  to  produce  a  significant  quantity  of  food.  The  enor- 
mous growth  of  urban  areas  led  to  a  rapid  decrease  of  available 
farmland,  while  at  the  same  time  population  increases  and  bigger 
incomes  meant  that  the  demand  for  food  greatly  outstripped  sup- 
ply. The  result  of  these  developments  was  that  by  the  late  1980s 
roughly  half  of  South  Korea's  needs,  mainly  wheat  and  animal  feed 
corn,  was  imported. 

Compared  with  the  industrial  and  service  sectors,  agriculture 
remained  the  most  sluggish  sector  of  the  economy.  In  1988  the  con- 
tribution of  agriculture  to  overall  GDP  was  only  about  10.8  per- 
cent, down  from  approximately  12.3  percent  the  previous  year. 
Most  economists  agreed  that  the  country's  rural  areas  had  gained 
more  than  they  had  contributed  in  the  course  of  industrialization. 
Still,  the  growth  of  agricultural  output,  which  averaged  3.4  per- 
cent per  year  between  1945  and  1974,  6.8  percent  annually  dur- 
ing the  1974-79  period,  and  5.6  percent  between  1980  and  1986, 
was  credible.  The  gains  were  even  more  impressive  because  they 
added  to  a  traditionally  high  level  of  productivity.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  overall  growth  of  the  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishing 
sector  was  only  0.6  percent  in  1987  as  compared  with  the  manufac- 
turing sector,  which  grew  16  percent  during  1986  and  1987.  Dur- 
ing the  first  half  of  1989,  the  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fisheries 
sector  grew  5.9  percent,  as  opposed  to  manufacturing's  2.9  percent. 

Major  Crops 

Rice  was  the  most  important  crop  and  yields  were  impressive. 
As  noted  by  Donald  S.  Macdonald,  however,  rising  wage  levels 
and  land  values  have  made  it  expensive  to  produce.  Rice  represent- 
ed about  90  percent  of  total  grain  production  and  over  40  percent 
of  farm  income;  the  1988  rice  crop  was  6.5  million  tons.  Rice  was 
imported  in  the  1980s,  but  the  amount  depended  on  the  success 
of  domestic  harvests.  The  government's  rice  support  program 
reached  a  record  US$1 .9  billion  in  1986,  as  compared  with  US$890 
million  in  1985.  By  raising  procurement  prices  by  14  percent  over 
the  1986  level,  Seoul  achieved  a  rice  price  structure  that  was  about 
five  times  that  of  the  world  market  in  1987. 

Barley  was  the  second  most  important  crop.  Its  production 
declined  from  about  1 .5  million  tons  in  1970  to  about  561 ,500  tons

in  1988.  Other  crops  included  such  grains  as  millet,  corn,  sorghum, 
buckwheat,  soybeans,  and  potatoes.  Fruits  and  vegetables  includ- 
ed pears,  grapes,  mandarin  oranges,  apples,  peaches,  Welsh  on- 
ions, Chinese  cabbage,  red  peppers,  persimmons,  cabbage,  peaches, 
and  radishes.  Other  important  cash  crops  included  cotton,  hemp, 
sesame,  tobacco,  and  ginseng.  In  1988,  livestock  heads  included 
native  Korean  cattle  (2  million),  hogs  (4.9  million),  and  poultry 
(almost  59  million). 

Forestry  and  Fishing 

South  Korean  farmers  have  always  used  the  nation's  forests  for 
fuel  and  household  products,  but  centuries  of  overutilization  and 
poor  resource  management  had  practically  denuded  the  country- 
side by  the  end  of  the  Choson  Dynasty  (1392-1910).  World  War 
II  interrupted  Japanese  efforts  to  replace  the  ravaged  forest  stock 
and  the  Korean  War  brought  to  a  peak  the  destruction  of  Korea's 
forests.  After  the  1950s,  Seoul  slowly  developed  the  organizational 
and  technical  expertise  to  save  the  nation's  trees.  Despite  frequent 
setbacks,  reforestation  had  proceeded  fairly  successfully  by  the 
1970s;  the  total  volume  of  timber  had  grown  from  a  low  of  30.8 
million  cubic  meters  in  1954  to  over  164.4  million  cubic  meters 
in  1984.  The  density  of  the  woodlands  expanded  from  an  average 
of  4.8  to  17.8  cubic  meters  per  hectare  of  forest  during  the  same 
period. 

By  1984  over  20  percent  of  the  nation's  6.5  million  hectares  of 
forest  belonged  to  the  government;  most  was  managed  by  the  Office 
of  Forestry,  a  branch  of  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs.  Another 
8  percent  was  owned  by  local  public  authorities;  72  percent  was 
privately  owned.  In  1985  about  two-thirds  of  South  Korea  was 
covered  by  forests.  Until  the  1970s,  reforestation  had  taken  place 
primarily  in  national  forests;  as  a  result  of  this  situation,  the  den- 
sity of  government-owned  forests  was  about  three  times  greater  than 
that  of  private  forests.  Most  forest  owners  were  smallholders  with 
inadequate  financial  resources  to  purchase  and  maintain  seedlings. 
However,  upon  the  introduction  of  the  Saemaul  Movement,  an 
ambitious  rural  development  program  launched  by  Park  in  1971, 
the  performance  of  the  Village  Forestry  Associations — similar  to 
and  often  overlapping  with  the  agricultural  cooperatives — improved 
significantly.  Between  1972  and  1979,  forestry  agents  and  village 
associations  planted  1 .4  million  hectares  with  3.4  million  seedlings. 

Although  the  fuel  needs  of  most  farmers  were  met  by  wood  from 
local  forests  or  coal  briquettes,  the  growing  industrial  demand  for 
timber  was  not  adequately  supplied  by  domestic  production.  In 
1977  South  Korea  imported  88  percent  of  its  timber,  mostly  from 


167 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


Malaysia  and  Indonesia.  In  1985  South  Korea  imported  US$538 
million  worth  of  wood,  lumber,  and  cork;  imports  were  US$549 
million  in  1986. 

South  Korea's  fishing  industry  contributed  both  to  the  welfare 
of  the  consumer  and  to  export  earnings.  Although  the  value-added 
income  from  fishing  contributed  less  than  1  percent  of  GNP  and 
the  fishing  population  decreased  by  over  18  percent  during  the  1970s 
(to  745,000  persons),  fishery  products  contributed  5  percent  of  the 
value  of  commodity  exports.  Fishery  production  totaled  470,000 
tons  in  1962,  1.3  million  tons  in  1972,  2.6  million  tons  in  1982, 
and  3.3  million  tons  in  1987.  In  1988  South  Korean  fishing  house- 
holds earned  about  US$10,000  on  average. 

Most  of  the  expansion  of  production  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  was 
the  result  of  deep-sea  fishing  operations.  The  major  fishing  ports 
were  Ulsan  and  Masan.  In  the  late  1980s,  the  production  of  sea- 
weed, oyster,  and  other  products  of  coastal  and  offshore  breeding 
farms  declined,  but  the  catch  of  tuna  and  squid  in  deep-sea  fishing 
rose.  Fishing  trawlers  brought  in  about  250,000  tons  of  pollock  off 
the  coast  of  Alaska  in  1985,  a  catch  that  both  contributed  to  the 
South  Korean  diet  and  was  exported  to  United  States  food  processors. 

In  1985  there  were  90,970  fishing  vessels  harvesting  a  total  catch 
of  858,471  tons.  Of  these  vessels,  71,836  were  motorized  (836,633 
tons)  and  19,134  (21,838  tons)  were  nonmotorized.  These  num- 
bers reflected  a  major  change  from  1962,  when  only  6,085  vessels 
out  of  45,504  were  motorized. 

The  Agricultural  Crisis  of  the  Late  1980s 

Agricultural  labor  costs  rose  as  young  people  left  rural  areas  for 
urban  jobs,  and  farm  work  mainly  was  done  by  women  and  old 
men.  Farmers'  relative  earnings  improved  during  the  1970s,  but 
fell  in  the  1980s.  The  gap  between  incomes  of  urbanites  and  peo- 
ple in  rural  areas  widened  considerably  in  the  late  1980s.  In  1988 
the  average  income  of  people  in  gun  (counties)  amounted  to  79.1 
percent  of  that  of  people  in  cities,  as  compared  with  84.7  percent 
in  1985.  South  Korean  farming  households  earned  about 
US$12,000  in  1988,  up  24.4  percent  from  1987.  In  comparison, 
the  average  income  for  an  urban  family  in  1989  was  about 
US$15,000.  Nonfarm  income  in  1989  comprised  39.5  percent  of 
average  farm  household  earnings,  as  compared  with  more  than  50 
percent  in  Japan  and  approximately  70  percent  in  Taiwan. 

Farm  families  accumulated  debts  averaging  about  US$4,620  per 
household  in  1988  and  had  average  assets  of  about  US$66,057. 
The  purchase  of  modern  farm  machinery  as  well  as  of  many  new 
consumer  goods  contributed  to  higher  debts.  The  35  percent  rise 


168 


The  Economy 


in  assets  between  1987  and  1988  mainly  was  because  of  a  41  percent 
increase  in  the  price  of  land.  Budgetary  pressures  from  the  govern- 
ment on  agricultural  price  supports  also  reduced  farm  income. 

There  was  increased  rental  of  farmland  in  the  1980s.  The  per- 
centage of  rented  farmland  among  total  farmland  rose  from  2 1  per- 
cent in  1980  to  30.5  percent  in  1985.  The  percentage  of  farm 
households  renting  some  of  their  land  among  total  farm  households 
expanded  rapidly  from  37.1  percent  in  1980  to  64.7  percent  in  1985. 
Nonfarmer  ownership  of  tenant  farmland  also  increased  to  63  per- 
cent in  1985. 

The  farmers  who  rented  land  were  mainly  the  small-landed  farm- 
ers adversely  affected  by  Seoul's  agricultural  open-door  policy  of 
the  1980s.  Under  this  policy,  the  government  sought  cheap  cereal 
prices  by  increasing  cheap  imports  and  promoted  large-scale  farm- 
ing where  crops  could  be  produced  more  cheaply  and  efficiently. 
In  the  early  1970s,  a  farm  family  could  meet  almost  100  percent 
of  household  expenses  by  farming  0.5  to  1  hectare,  but  by  1985 
such  small  plots  of  land  only  met  59.8  percent  of  expenses.  Many 
farmers  had  to  rent  extra  land  to  augment  their  incomes. 

Poor  prospects  on  the  farm  depleted  farm  villages  as  the  young 
left  and  the  old  died.  Parents  sent  their  children  to  the  towns  and 
cities  for  a  better  education.  Young  farmers  who  could  not  find 
wives  also  left  for  the  cities. 

The  government  initiated  various  programs  to  improve  rural  con- 
ditions. The  most  extensive  of  these  was  the  New  Community 
Movement  (Saemaul  undong,  known  as  the  Saemaul  Movement). 
Its  goal  was  to  mobilize  villagers  in  their  own  service.  At  first  Sae- 
maul projects  were  aimed  at  improving  household  living  conditions. 
Later,  projects  were  directed  more  to  the  village  as  a  whole  and 
included  the  construction  of  roads,  bridges,  irrigation  ditches,  and 
common  compost  plots.  Next,  the  program  focused  on  more  eco- 
nomic concerns — group  farming,  common  seed  beds,  livestock 
production,  forestation,  and  even  joint  marketing  and  factories. 
Better  health  and  sanitation  as  well  as  beautification  of  the  environ- 
ment also  became  program  goals.  The  government  provided  the 
materials  and  small  amounts  of  money  to  the  villagers,  who  sup- 
plied the  labor.  In  the  early  1980s,  President  Chun  removed  con- 
trol over  the  Saemaul  Movement  from  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs 
and  left  most  decisionmaking  to  the  Saemaul  leaders  and  bureau- 
crats, headed  by  the  president's  younger  brother,  Chon  Kyong- 
hwan.  The  Saemaul  Movement  initially  was  quite  successful  but 
deteriorated  in  the  early  1980s.  Chon  Kyong-hwan,  arrested  on 
a  variety  of  corruption  charges  in  1988,  was  accused  of  large-scale

extortion  and  embezzlement  while  he  was  chairman  of  the  move- 
ment between  1981  and  1987. 

South  Korea,  a  high-cost  agricultural  producer,  prohibited  un- 
restricted beef  and  rice  imports  and  severely  limited  many  other 
agricultural  imports.  Foreign  trading  partners  such  as  the  United 
States  pressured  South  Korea  to  open  up  the  agricultural  market, 
but  Seoul  said  that  its  farmers  would  be  hurt  badly  by  the  impor- 
tation of  inexpensive  beef,  rice,  tobacco,  and  other  products.  In 
April  1989,  Seoul  released  a  list  of  243  agricultural  products  sched- 
uled for  import  liberalization  by  1991,  but  the  list  did  not  include 
beef.  In  the  late  1980s,  many  farmers,  already  deeply  in  debt,  were 
told  by  the  government  that  they  might  have  to  compete  in  the 
world  market  and  took  to  the  streets  to  protest  against  foreign  de- 
mands and  to  demand  further  protection  from  the  government. 

In  the  late  1980s,  farmers  gained  political  strength  through  the 
increased  activities  of  various  farm  associations  and  the  formation 
of  new  organizations,  such  as  the  National  Association  of  Farmers 
(Chon'guk-nongmin  hyophoe)  established  in  1987.  The  Korean 
Catholic  Farmers  Association  and  Protestant  Farmers  Association 
became  active  in  1987.  These  and  other  independent  farm  groups 
applied  strong  pressure  on  the  government  to  alleviate  their  problems. 
Rural  residents  made  up  less  than  one  quarter  of  South  Korea's 
voters,  but  they  elected  almost  half  of  the  National  Assembly;  thus, 
they  exercised  virtual  veto  power  over  farming  legislation. 

Prospects 

The  long-term  prospects  for  agriculture  were  not  encouraging. 
Traditionally  the  peninsula's  rice  basket,  South  Korea  had  not  been 
self-sufficient  agriculturally  for  many  years.  In  the  late  1980s,  almost 
half  the  nation's  foodstuff  needs  were  imports,  mostly  wheat  and 
animal  feed  corn.  Natural  disasters  compounded  the  problems  of 
farmers  in  the  1980s.  As  a  result  of  these  factors,  the  share  of  the 
GNP  provided  by  the  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishing  sector  share 
of  the  GNP  shrank  5.2  percent  in  1987. 

However,  the  situation  was  not  totally  bleak  in  the  early  1990s. 
Although  the  purchasing  power  of  the  agricultural  sector  had  been 
declining  since  the  early  1960s  relative  to  other  sectors  of  the  econ- 
omy, the  rate  of  agricultural  productivity  increased  in  the  1980s. 
Livestock  raising  and  rice  cultivation  had  come  to  dominate  the 
agricultural  sector  over  a  variety  of  traditional  agricultural  pursuits. 

Service  Industries 

Service  industries  included  insurance,  restaurants,  hotels,  laun- 
dries, public  bath  houses,  health-related  services,  and  entertainment

The  Economy 


establishments.  There  were  thousands  of  small  shops  marketing 
specialized  items,  large  traditional  marketplaces,  and  streamlined 
buildings  housing  corporate  and  professional  offices.  Game  rooms 
featuring  Ping-Pong  tables,  or  billiards,  and  tearooms  serving  a 
variety  of  beverages  were  located  on  almost  every  downtown  city 
corner. 

South  Korea's  hosting  of  the  1988  Seoul  Olympics  from  Sep- 
tember 18  to  October  2,  1988,  made  1988  a  boom  year  for  tourism. 
More  than  2  million  tourists  spent  US$3.3  billion,  an  increase  in 
the  number  of  tourists  and  the  dollars  spent,  respectively,  of  24.9 
percent  and  42.2  percent  over  1987.  Japanese  visitors  accounted 
for  48  percent  of  the  total;  tourists  from  the  United  States  made 
up  14.9  percent.  The  Korean  National  Tourist  Corporation  predict- 
ed that  in  1990  almost  3  million  tourists  would  visit  the  country. 

An  improved  transportation  and  communications  infrastructure, 
increasing  incomes,  enhanced  consumer  sophistication,  and  govern- 
ment tax  incentives  encouraged  the  development  of  a  modern  dis- 
tribution network  of  chain  stores,  supermarkets,  and  department 
stores  (see  Transportation  and  Telecommunications,  this  ch.). 

In  the  mid-1980s,  the  largest  employer  of  South  Korea's  ser- 
vice sector  was  retail  trade.  A  growing  number  of  workers  were 
employed  by  the  mostly  department  stores  (most  of  which  were 
owned  by  chaebol)  that  were  opening  rapidly  in  the  downtown  areas 
of  major  urban  centers.  The  vast  majority  of  retailers  were  small 
merchants  in  cities,  towns,  and  villages,  each  with  a  modest  store- 
front, or  stand,  limited  stock,  and  poor  access  to  capital,  but  the 
great  majority  of  South  Koreans  made  their  purchases  from  these 
small  retailers.  In  1986  there  were  approximately  26,054  whole- 
sale and  542,548  retail  establishments  and  233,834  hotels  and 
restaurants  that  employed  about  1 . 7  million  people  (these  figures 
probably  do  not  include  family  members  working  in  small  stores) . 

The  distribution  system  was  far  from  perfect,  and  managers 
recognized  the  need  for  better  organization  and  management.  Most 
of  the  nation's  wholesalers  were  located  in  Seoul  and  accounted 
for  most  of  the  turnover  of  goods.  Most  of  the  sales  outlets  were 
located  in  the  heart  of  urban  centers.  Cargo  truck  terminals  and 
warehouse  facilities  were  spread  irregularly  through  city  neigh- 
borhoods. 

Money  and  Banking 

When  Park  Chung  Hee  became  president  in  1961 ,  he  organized 
a  highly  centralized  government  with  the  power  to  direct  the  econ- 
omy. Park  quickly  nationalized  all  banks,  took  control  of  foreign 
borrowing,  and  merged  the  agricultural  cooperative  movement  with 


171 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

the  agricultural  bank.  The  government  also  took  control  of  all  forms 
of  institutional  credit,  giving  Park  great  control  over  the  business 
community. 

The  government  began  to  liberalize  the  banking  system  in  the 
mid-1980s  by  denationalizing  several  banks,  but  refused  to  allow 
individual  chaebol  to  acquire  controlling  shares  in  these  banks.  The 
government  still  maintained  strong  managerial  controls  over  these 
banks  through  the  Bank  of  Korea's  Office  of  Bank  Supervision  and 
Examination,  which,  under  the  guidance  of  the  Monetary  Board, 
supervised  and  regularly  examined  banking  institutions.  Most  of 
the  credit  provided  by  these  banks  went  to  the  chaebol,  but  the  banks 
also  were  required  by  law  to  make  at  least  one-third  of  their  busi- 
ness loans  to  small  and  medium-sized  firms. 

South  Korea's  financial  sector  in  the  late  1980s  included  a  diver- 
sified commercial  banking  system,  a  securities  market,  and  a  wide 
range  of  secondary  financial  institutions.  The  banks  kept  pace  with 
the  rest  of  the  economy,  particularly  after  the  liberalization  and 
modernization  of  financial  institutions  in  the  mid-1980s  and  the 
establishment  of  the  capital  market  system  based  on  the  Fifth  Five- 
Year  Economic  and  Social  Development  Plan. 

The  Bank  of  Korea  was  established  as  the  central  bank  on  June 
12,  1950.  Its  major  functions  included  the  issuance  of  all  currency; 
the  formulation  and  execution  of  monetary  and  credit  policies;  the 
conduct  of  the  bulk  of  foreign  exchange  control  business;  the 
research,  collection,  and  preparation  of  statistics  on  many  aspects 
of  South  Korea's  financial  system;  and  the  supervision  and  regu- 
lation of  the  activities  of  private  banks.  The  Bank  of  Korea  en- 
gaged in  loan  and  deposit  transactions  for  the  government; 
additionally,  the  bank  transacted  various  government  business 
activities.  It  also  made  loans  to  and  received  deposits  from  other 
banking  institutions;  all  banks  maintained  their  solvency  through 
balances  at  the  Bank  of  Korea. 

South  Korea's  five  major  commercial  banks  (Chohung,  Com- 
mercial, First,  Hanil,  and  Seoul)  were  privately  held.  Together  with 
two  city  bank  joint  ventures — the  Kor-Am  Bank  and  the  Shin-Han 
(co-owned  with  the  United  States  and  Japan  respectively) — there 
were  961  commercial  bank  branches  across  South  Korea  at  the  end 
of  1987.  Local  banks  were  found  in  every  province. 

The  Bank  of  Korea  regulated  all  commercial  banking  activities 
under  the  provisions  of  the  General  Banking  Act  passed  in  1954. 
Commercial  banks  got  their  money  through  deposits  from  the 
general  public,  international  loans,  and  funds  borrowed  from  the 
Bank  of  Korea.  The  lending  activities  of  commercial  banks  focused 
on  short-term  loans  or  discounts  because  long-term  lending  was 


172 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

still  the  prerogative  of  such  specialized  banks  as  the  Korea  Exchange 
Bank,  Korea  Housing  Bank,  and  National  Agricultural  Coopera- 
tives Federation.  In  the  late  1980s,  the  banking  industry  operated 
according  to  a  "prime"  bank  system  whereby  each  major  South 
Korean  bank  was  assigned  one  domestic  commercial  bank.  Un- 
der specific  legislation  designed  to  achieve  certain  functions  or  to 
assist  special  markets,  six  special  banks  received  funds  from  the 
government  and  from  the  sales  of  debentures. 

Three  other  financial  development  institutions  supplied  credit 
for  business  and  government  projects.  The  Export-Import  Bank 
of  Korea  extended  medium-  and  long-term  credit  to  both  suppli- 
ers and  buyers  to  facilitate  exports  of  capital  goods  and  services, 
major  resources  development,  and  overseas  investment.  The  Korea 
Development  Bank,  which  was  the  government's  shareholder  in 
state-run  enterprises,  raised  funds  from  the  government  as  well  as 
from  international  financial  institutions  and  foreign  banks  to  fund 
key  industries  and  infrastructure  projects.  The  Korea  Long-Term 
Credit  Bank  financed  equipment  investment. 

Small  and  Medium-Sized  Businesses 

Small  and  medium-sized  businesses — generally  those  with  less 
than  400  employees — accounted  for  US$1 1  billion,  or  32  percent, 
of  South  Korea's  exports  in  1986.  By  1987  these  businesses  gener- 
ated an  estimated  US$14  billion,  but  the  export  percentage  dropped 
to  30  percent  as  large  automobile  and  electronics  groups  led  ex- 
port growth.  Small  and  medium-sized  businesses  contributed  38.9 
percent  to  the  GNP  in  1986  when  calculated  on  a  value-added  basis. 

Many  of  South  Korea's  smaller  firms  manufacture  specialized 
parts  or  equipment  for  the  larger  chaebol.  As  is  the  case  with  keiretsu 
in  Japan,  many  of  the  chaebol  in  South  Korea  assemble  and  mar- 
ket goods  under  their  own  brandnames,  but  rely  on  smaller  sup- 
port firms  to  manufacture  most  of  the  individual  parts.  Wages  are 
often  lower  in  the  smaller  firms  than  at  the  chaebol,  and  working 
conditions  often  are  worse. 

Starting  in  1 983 ,  Seoul  selected  a  number  of  the  more  promis- 
ing smaller  firms  to  receive  special  government  assistance.  These 
businesses  were  eligible  for  a  number  of  tax  breaks,  help  in  secur- 
ing financing,  and  consultations  and  technical  education  from  the 
Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry.  Small  businesses  were  central  to 
the  government's  policy  of  producing  more  sophisticated  technol- 
ogy locally;  additionally,  they  were  critical  to  the  government's 
strategy  of  encouraging  regional  development  away  from  the  over- 
crowded area  around  Seoul.  In  1989  the  government  announced 
a  plan  to  spend  billions  of  won  to  help  small  and  medium-sized

industries  seek  structural  improvements  so  that  they  could  move 
away  from  labor-intensive  production  in  favor  of  technology- 
intensive  production. 

The  Labor  Force 

Despite  significant  increases  in  wages  in  the  1980s,  labor  unions 
in  the  late  1980s  continued  their  wave  of  strikes  demanding  better 
working  conditions  and  wages.  The  ferocity  and  sheer  size  of  the 
labor  movement  caught  management  and  the  government  by  sur- 
prise. During  his  first  year  or  so  in  office,  President  Roh  Tae  Woo 
was  confronted  with  considerable  labor  unrest;  there  were  more 
than  300  strikes  in  the  first  three  months  of  1989  (see  Interest 
Groups,  ch.  4).  Emboldened  by  the  political  reforms  of  1987  and 
by  reports  that  the  rate  of  South  Korea's  economic  growth  was 
greater  than  the  improvements  in  their  own  incomes  and  life-styles, 
many  workers  agitated  for  a  greater  share  of  the  nation's  prosperity 
and  sought  more  freedom  and  responsibility  at  the  workplace  and 
an  end  to  the  traditional  paternalism  of  management.  Lost  produc- 
tion was  estimated  to  have  climbed  to  US$6  billion  in  1989  from 
US$4.4  billion  in  1988. 

Workers  were  caught  in  a  revolution  of  rising  expectations,  as 
a  wave  of  rising  urban  land  values  and  housing  costs  outpaced  aver- 
age real  wage  increases  of  more  than  70  percent  during  the  1980s. 
Moreover,  wages  for  manual  workers,  who  were  responsible  for 
much  of  the  production  and  export  that  fueled  the  economy,  were 
much  lower  than  the  national  average.  In  the  late  1980s,  working 
families  still  found  themselves  struggling  to  meet  minimum  stan- 
dards of  living.  Employees  also  were  expected  to  work  long  and 
often  erratic  hours  in  exchange  for  steady  employment  and  were 
frustrated  over  a  lack  of  benefits  and  individual  say.  One  labor  acti- 
vist noted  in  1989  that  the  labor  movement  "is  not  a  class  struggle. 
We  just  want  better  working  conditions  and  better  status  for  work- 
ers. We  have  been  looked  down  on  in  Korea  for  a  very  long  time. ' ' 

Worker  complaints  were  focused  on  three  areas:  low  wages,  long 
working  hours,  and  a  high  number  of  industrial  accidents.  In  1986 
the  average  wage  of  a  South  Korean  worker  was  US$381  a  month 
(339,474  won),  including  overtime  and  all  allowances.  The  basic 
wage  was  US$287,  or  255,408  won,  but,  according  to  the  govern- 
ment, the  basic  wage  necessary  to  sustain  a  "decent"  way  of  life 
was  US$588  (524,1 13  won).  Thus,  the  average  worker  only  earned 
two-thirds  of  what  the  government  thought  necessary  to  sustain 
a  family  of  four.  In  1987  semiskilled  workers  typically  received 
US$1 .50  to  US$2.00  per  hour  and  worked  fifty-five  to  sixty  hours 


175 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


a  week;  unskilled  workers  worked  twelve-hour  days  seven  days  a 
week,  earning  US$125  a  month. 

There  were,  however,  dramatic  increases  in  wages  in  1988  and 
1989.  Labor  stoppages  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  coupled  with 
a  scarcity  of  labor,  led  to  20-percent  salary  increases  for  workers 
in  the  manufacturing  sector  in  1988  and  25-percent  salary  increases 
in  that  sector  in  1989.  These  raises  later  spread,  increasing  wages 
across  the  entire  economy  18.7  percent  in  1989.  By  1989  some  South 
Korean  economists  were  worrying  about  the  effect  that  skyrocket- 
ing wages  would  have  on  the  cost  of  domestic-made  goods  and  the 
consequent  impact  on  export  prices.  The  situation  was  especially 
worrisome  because  the  wages  paid  to  workers  in  South  Korea's 
major  competitors  were  growing  far  more  slowly. 

South  Korea  was  known  for  having  the  world's  longest  working 
hours.  In  1986  the  Korean  worker  averaged  about  54.7  hours  a 
week.  This  situation  was  the  natural  consequence  of  the  low  wage 
system  that  necessitated  extended  hours  and  extra  work  to  earn 
minimum  living  expenses. 

Wages  and  Living  Conditions 

The  economic  expansion  of  the  1980s  caused  rapid  improvements 
in  the  living  conditions  of  many  South  Koreans,  which  does  not 
mean,  however,  that  all  lived  comfortably.  Indeed,  one  had  only 
to  wander  the  narrow  alleys  of  Seoul,  Inch 'on,  or  other  South 
Korean  cities  to  see  poor  living  conditions.  In  1990  families  in  slum 
areas  of  Seoul  usually  had  electricity  and  running  water,  as  well 
as  a  small  range  for  cooking,  a  television,  and  a  radio  or  two.  But 
living  space  was  crowded,  furniture  was  shabby,  and  buildings  were 
badly  built  and  gloomy.  People  in  poorer  families  seemed  to  be 
fairly  healthy  and  had  adequate  diets.  The  level  of  starvation,  as 
well  as  the  cost  of  some  foodstuffs,  seemed  low.  Beggars  and  the 
homeless  who  wandered  the  streets  were  infrequent.  Although  there 
were  some  noticeable  exceptions,  farming  families  generally  lived 
in  small  houses,  with  few  of  the  basic  luxuries  of  middle-class  ur- 
ban families. 

Living  conditions  in  South  Korea's  cities,  however,  were  im- 
proving in  the  late  1980s.  According  to  the  Economic  Planning 
Board,  in  April  1988,  the  average  monthly  income  in  Seoul  and 
other  major  cities  was  612,400  won  (US$868)  a  rise  of  16.1  per- 
cent over  the  previous  year. 

A  composite  portrait  of  average  middle-class  families  in  Seoul 
would  show  the  following:  a  husband  in  his  early  forties,  a  wife 
about  six  years  younger,  and  two  children,  aged  thirteen  and  ten. 
The  family  would  live  in  a  fairly  small  apartment,  consisting  of 


176 


The  Economy 


a  hallway,  one  small  bedroom  with  bunk  beds  for  the  children,  a 
small  room  with  several  bureaus  and  with  mats  as  floor  coverings, 
a  television  set  and  a  videocassette  recorder,  and  a  hi-fi  stereo.  This 
room  would  serve  as  an  eating  area  and  family  room  during  the 
day  and  as  the  parents'  sleeping  area  at  night.  There  also  would 
be  a  larger  room  partitioned  off  into  three  sections:  a  living  room 
with  three  elaborate  easy  chairs,  a  more  formal  dining  area,  and 
a  small  kitchen  with  an  oven-range,  sink,  washing  machine,  shelves, 
and  cabinets.  The  mother  would  stay  at  home;  the  father  would 
work  from  9:00  A.M.  to  10:00  P.M.  six  days  a  week.  There  would 
be  a  fairly  new  car,  probably  a  Hyundai,  which  the  father  would 
use  to  drive  to  work. 

A  survey  of  income  distribution  in  South  Korea  in  1985  and  1988 
showed  that  average  household  income  had  risen  on  average  14.8 
percent  per  year,  from  5,857,000  won  (US$8,645  based  on  the  1989 
exchange  rate  of  US$1  =  677.5  won)  to  8,863,000  won  (US$13,081). 
The  Gini  coefficient,  a  commonly  used  measure  of  income  distri- 
bution, dropped  slightiy  from  0.3449  in  1985  to  0.3355  in  1988. 
The  comparable  figure  stood  at  0.285  in  Japan  in  1985  and  at  0.364 
in  the  United  States  in  1978. 

As  noted  by  David  I.  Steinberg,  economic  growth  translated  into 
fairly  equitable  income  distribution  when  compared  with  other  na- 
tions experiencing  similar  development  and  its  attendant  problems. 
When  Park  took  office,  approximately  40  percent  of  the  popula- 
tion lived  below  the  poverty  line;  by  the  late  1980s,  less  than  10 
percent  of  the  population  lived  under  the  poverty  line,  although 
incomes  at  the  top  of  the  scale  had  increased  faster  than  those  at 
the  bottom.  Salary  increases  had  not  been  constant  under  Park's 
regime  because  Park  did  not  want  high  labor  costs  to  detract  from 
the  competitiveness  of  South  Korean  goods  on  the  international 
market.  By  the  late  1980s,  capital-intensive  higher  technology  was 
more  important.  Further,  although  wages  had  increased  substan- 
tially in  the  late  1980s,  this  increase  was  not  because  of  the  good 
will  of  the  chaebol  or  the  government,  but  was  the  result  of  a  great 
many  strikes  and  a  shortage  of  skilled  workers  as  industry  expanded 
and  large  numbers  of  workers  moved  to  the  Middle  East  to  work 
on  construction  projects. 

The  purchasing  power  of  the  average  citizen  rose  rapidly  in  the 
1980s.  Real  per  capita  GNP  more  than  doubled  between  1983  and 
1988  (from  US$1,914  to  US$4,040)  and  was  expected  to  reach 
US$5,100  by  1991.  South  Korea  was  already  transforming  itself 
into  a  durable  consumer  society.  By  the  late  1980s,  television  sets 
and  refrigerators  had  become  a  standard  part  of  the  average  house- 
hold, and  ownership  of  an  automobile  was  not  unusual.  Families 


177 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

tended  to  consume  more  meat,  fresh  vegetables  and  fruit,  canned 
or  processed  foods,  and  to  eat  less  rice  than  in  previous  decades. 
They  also  dressed  in  modern  fashions  made  from  quality  fabrics. 

Higher  incomes  led  to  significant  shifts  in  consumption  patterns. 
For  example,  in  1963  the  average  family  spent  57.4  percent  of  its 
budget  on  food.  Twenty  years  later,  the  share  going  to  food  had 
fallen  to  40  percent  and  was  expected  to  continue  to  fall  (but  not 
as  rapidly  as  in  the  past).  Despite  the  decreasing  share  of  food  in 
the  consumer  budget,  the  absolute  value  of  food  consumed  grew 
regularly  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  and  was  expected  to  continue  to 
do  so  in  the  1990s.  Rising  incomes,  the  increased  mobility  of  the 
average  person,  and  a  high  literacy  rate  demonstrated  evident  so- 
cioeconomic progress. 

Industrial  Safety 

Of  the  almost  5  million  workers  employed  in  70,865  South 
Korean  factories  in  1986,  some  142,000  (nearly  3  percent)  were 
so  badly  injured  that  they  had  to  be  hospitalized  for  more  than  four 
days.  There  were  1,660  workers  killed  in  industrial  accidents,  mean- 
ing an  average  of  just  over  four  workers  died  each  day.  Long  work- 
ing hours  and  bad  working  conditions  contributed  to  high  rates 
of  injury  and  death. 

Transporation  and  Telecommunications 
Roads 

Domestic  transportation  improved  greatly  during  the  1980s,  and 
growth  was  evident  in  all  sectors.  The  rapid  improvement  and  ex- 
tension of  public  roads  and  the  increasing  availability  of  motor  ve- 
hicles contributed  enormously  to  the  mobility  of  the  population. 
Approximately  51,000  kilometers  of  roadways  spanned  the  coun- 
try in  1988,  46.3  percent  of  which  were  paved.  Express  highways 
facilitated  travel  between  major  cities  and  reached  a  combined 
length  of  1,539  kilometers  in  1988,  as  compared  to  86.8  kilome- 
ters in  1967  (see  fig.  11).  The  1980s  saw  the  increased  paving  of 
roads  and  the  building  of  ultramodern  highways  around  Seoul  (es- 
pecially in  the  vicinity  of  the  Olympic  stadiums)  and  between  Seoul 
and  such  major  cities  as  Pusan  and  Taegu.  In  1989  the  govern- 
ment announced  that  it  would  start  construction  on  nine  new  ex- 
pressways with  a  combined  length  of  1,243  kilometers.  In  1996, 
when  the  expressways  and  two  additional  projects  were  expected 
to  be  completed,  South  Korea  was  expected  to  have  twenty-one 
expressways  with  a  combined  length  of  2,840  kilometers. 

The  total  number  of  motor  vehicles  climbed  rapidly  in  the  1980s.

The  Economy 


By  1987  there  were  approximately  845,000  passenger  cars  and 
748,000  commercial  vehicles,  up  from  a  combined  total  of  about 
744,000  in  1980.  In  1988  South  Korean  automakers  produced 
504,000  vehicles  for  domestic  sale  and  576,134  vehicles  for  export. 
In  the  first  nine  months  of  1989,  domestic  sales  reached  nearly 
800,000  vehicles. 

The  expansion  and  rapid  improvement  of  South  Korea's  long- 
distance highway  system  led  to  the  growth  of  an  excellent  intercity 
bus  system  in  the  1980s.  In  1988  there  were  ten  express  bus  com- 
panies operating  a  fleet  of  some  900  buses  connecting  all  of  the 
major  cities  of  Korea. 

Subways  and  Railroads 

In  1990  subways  were  gradually  replacing  buses  as  the  main 
means  of  transportation  in  Seoul.  The  Seoul  subway,  the  first  part 
of  which  opened  in  1974,  was  operated  by  the  Seoul  Metropolitan 
Rapid  Transit  Company.  In  1985  the  system  carried  approximately 
3  million  passengers  daily.  In  1990  the  subway  had  more  than  200 
kilometers  of  track,  enabling  commuters  to  reach  any  station  within 
the  45 -kilometer  radius  of  the  capital  city  within  an  hour.  One  line 
connected  Seoul  with  Inch 'on.  Four  subway  lines  served  Seoul, 
in  addition  to  the  lines  of  the  Korean  National  Railroad. 

South  Korea  has  an  excellent  railroad  network.  The  first  rail- 
road, which  linked  Seoul  and  Inch 'on,  was  opened  in  September 
1899.  Other  major  lines  were  laid  by  the  Japanese  during  the  coloni- 
al period;  these  included  lines  originating  in  Mokp'o,  Masan,  and 
Pusan.  These  lines  connected  to  Seoul  and  to  Sinuiju  in  North 
Korea,  where  they  were  linked  with  the  Trans-Siberian  Railway. 
The  railroad  network  was  badly  damaged  during  the  Korean  War, 
but  it  was  later  rebuilt  and  improved. 

Throughout  the  1970s  and  1980s,  the  Korean  National  Railroad, 
a  state-run  corporation  under  the  Ministry  of  Transportation,  was 
in  charge  of  all  rails  and  continued  electrifying  heavily  used  tracks 
and  laying  additional  tracks.  As  of  1987,  the  combined  length  of 
the  country's  railroad  network  was  approximately  6,340  kilome- 
ters, including  approximately  761.8  kilometers  of  double-track  rail- 
roads and  1,023  kilometers  of  electric  railroads.  Suburban  lines 
were  electrified  and  connected  to  the  Seoul  subway  system.  Roll- 
ing stock  included  459  diesel  locomotives,  90  electric  locomotives, 
133  motor  coaches,  and  370  electric  motor  cars.  In  1989  Seoul 
announced  that  it  was  studying  the  possibility  of  constructing  high- 
speed railway  systems  similar  to  those  in  Japan  and  France. 

Railroads  in  the  1980s  were  useful  primarily  in  the  transporta- 
tion of  freight,  but  they  also  were  important  for  passenger  traffic 


181 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

around  Seoul  and  in  the  heavily-traveled  corridor  linking  the  cap- 
ital with  the  southern  port  of  Pusan.  Although  the  railroad  system 
grew  little  during  the  1980s  (there  were  already  5,600  kilometers 
of  tracks  in  1980),  rail  improvements — the  increased  electrifica- 
tion of  tracks,  replacement  of  older  tracks,  and  the  addition  of  rolling 
stock — allowed  rail  traffic  to  boom.  Some  of  the  busiest  lines  south 
of  Seoul  linking  the  capital  with  Pusan  and  Mokp'o  had  three  or 
four  tracks.  The  1980s  also  saw  the  introduction  of  high-speed  trains 
connecting  Seoul  with  Pusan,  Chonju,  Mokp'o,  and  Kyongju.  The 
famous  "Blue  Train"  between  Seoul  and  Pusan  (via  Taejon  and 
Taegu)  took  only  four  hours  and  fifty  minutes  and  offered  two  class- 
es of  service,  first  class  and  special.  In  1987  approximately  525  mil- 
lion passengers  and  59.28  million  metric  tons  were  transported  by 
the  railroad  system. 

Civil  Aviation 

Although  most  interurban  travel  was  either  by  express  bus  or 
by  train,  air  service  between  major  cities  was  increasingly  availa- 
ble and  popular,  especially  among  business  travelers.  Korean  Air, 
founded  by  the  government  in  1962  and  privately  owned  since  1969, 
was  South  Korea's  sole  airline  until  1988.  Korean  Air  served  nine 
major  domestic  routes  in  1988  and  also  offered  international  ser- 
vice to  Japan,  the  United  States,  Canada,  West  Germany,  France, 
Hong  Kong,  Iraq,  Libya,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  Saudi  Ara- 
bia, Singapore,  Switzerland,  Taiwan,  Thailand,  and  the  United 
Arab  Emirates.  A  second  carrier,  Asiana  Airlines,  was  established 
in  1988  to  serve  three  domestic  cities.  Seoul's  Kimp'o  International 
Airport  nearly  doubled  in  size  by  1989  (largely  because  of  the  Seoul 
Olympics)  to  accommodate  the  rapidly  growing  number  of  air 
travelers.  There  also  were  international  airports  at  Pusan  and 
Cheju;  another  was  planned  for  Ch'ongju. 

Telecommunications 

Communications  services  improved  dramatically  in  the  1980s 
with  the  assistance  of  foreign  partners  and  as  a  result  of  the  de- 
velopment of  the  electronics  industry.  The  number  of  telephones 
in  use  in  1987  reached  9.2  million,  a  considerable  increase  from 
1980,  when  there  were  2.8  million  subscribers  (which,  in  turn,  was 
four  times  the  number  of  subscribers  in  1972). 

Radio,  and  in  more  recent  years  television,  reached  virtually  ev- 
ery resident  (see  The  Media,  ch.  4).  The  Japanese  established  a 
radio  station  in  Seoul  in  1927;  by  1945  there  were  about  60,000 
radio  sets  in  the  country.  By  1987  there  were  approximately  42 
million  radio  receivers  in  use,  and  more  than  100  radio  stations 


182 


The  Economy 


were  broadcasting.  Transistor  radios  and  television  sets  have  made 
their  way  to  the  most  remote  rural  areas.  Television  sets,  now  mass- 
produced  in  South  Korea,  became  far  less  expensive;  most  city  peo- 
ple and  a  significant  number  of  rural  families  owned  or  had  access 
to  a  television.  Ownership  of  television  sets  grew  from  25,000  sets 
when  broadcasting  was  initiated  in  1961  to  an  estimated  8.6  mil- 
lion sets  in  1987,  and  more  than  250  television  stations  were  broad- 
casting. 

Foreign  Economic  Relations 

Exports  were  the  key  to  South  Korea's  industrial  expansion.  Until 
1986  the  value  of  imports  was  greater  than  exports.  This  situation 
was  reversed,  however,  in  1986  when  South  Korea  registered  a 
favorable  balance  of  trade  of  US$4.2  billion.  By  1988  the  favor- 
able balance  had  grown  to  US$1 1 .4  billion.  Financing  this  persis- 
tent, although  not  unexpected,  gap  between  domestic  and  imported 
resources  was  a  principal  concern  for  economic  planners.  In  the 
1950s  and  1960s,  much  of  the  trade  deficit  was  financed  by  for- 
eign aid  funds,  but  in  the  last  two  decades,  borrowing  from  and 
investment  in  international  capital  markets  have  almost  completely 
substituted  for  economic  aid. 

Aid,  Loans,  and  Investment 

Foreign  economic  assistance  was  essential  to  the  country's  recov- 
ery from  the  Korean  War  in  the  1950s  and  to  economic  growth 
in  the  1960s  because  it  saved  Seoul  from  having  to  devote  scarce 
foreign  exchange  to  the  import  of  food  and  other  necessary  goods, 
such  as  cement.  It  also  freed  South  Korea  from  the  burden  of  heavy 
international  debts  during  the  initial  phase  of  growth  and  enabled 
the  government  to  allocate  credit  in  accordance  with  planning  goals 
(see  The  Post-War  Economy,  ch.  1).  From  1953  to  1974,  when 
grant  assistance  dwindled  to  a  negligible  amount,  the  nation 
received  some  US$4  billion  of  grant  aid.  About  US$3  billion  was 
received  before  1968,  forming  an  average  of  60  percent  of  all  in- 
vestment in  South  Korea.  As  Park's  policies  took  effect,  however, 
the  dependence  on  foreign  grant  assistance  lessened.  During  the 
1966-74  period,  foreign  assistance  constituted  about  4.5  percent 
of  GNP  and  less  than  20  percent  of  all  investment.  Before  1965 
the  United  States  was  the  largest  single  aid  contributor,  but  there- 
after Japan  and  other  international  sponsors  played  an  increasingly 
important  role. 

Apart  from  grant  assistance,  other  forms  of  aid  were  offered; 
after  1 963  South  Korea  received  foreign  capital  mainly  in  the  form 
of  loans  at  concessionary  rates  of  interest.  According  to  government 


183 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

sources,  between  1964  and  1974  such  loans  averaged  about  6.5  per- 
cent of  all  foreign  borrowing.  Other  data  suggested  a  much  higher 
figure;  it  seemed  that  most  loans  to  the  government  were  conces- 
sional, at  least  through  the  early  1970s.  International  Monetary 
Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary)  data  showed  that  imports  financed 
through  such  means  as  foreign  export-import  loans  with  reduced 
rates  of  interest  totaled  11.6  percent  of  all  imports  from  1975  to 
1979.  The  aid  component  of  these  loans  was  only  a  fraction  of  their 
total  value. 

During  the  mid-1960s,  South  Korea's  economy  grew  so  rapidly 
that  the  United  States  decided  to  phase  out  its  aid  program  to  Seoul. 
South  Korea  became  increasingly  integrated  into  the  international 
capital  market;  from  the  late  1960s  to  the  mid-1980s,  development 
was  financed  with  a  series  of  foreign  loans,  two-thirds  of  which  came 
from  private  banks  and  suppliers'  credits.  Total  external  debt  grew 
to  a  high  of  US$46.7  billion  in  1985.  Positive  trade  balances  in 
the  late  1980s  led  to  a  rapid  decline  in  foreign  debt — from  US$35.6 
billion  in  1987  to  an  expected  US$23  billion  by  1991 .  Account  sur- 
pluses in  1990  were  expected  to  enable  Seoul  to  reduce  its  foreign 
debt  from  its  1987  level  of  about  28  percent  of  GNP  to  about  10 
percent  by  1991. 

United  States  assistance  ended  in  the  early  1970s,  from  which 
time  South  Korea  had  to  meet  its  need  for  capital  investment  on 
the  competitive  international  market  and,  increasingly,  from  domes- 
tic accounts.  The  government  and  private  industry  received  funds 
through  commercial  banks,  the  World  Bank  (see  Glossary),  and 
other  foreign  government  agencies.  In  the  mid-1980s,  total  direct 
foreign  equity  investment  in  South  Korea  was  well  over  US$1 
billion. 

The  fact  that  South  Korea  was  so  dependent  on  foreign  trade 
made  it  very  vulnerable  to  international  market  fluctuations.  The 
rapid  growth  of  South  Korea's  domestic  market  in  the  late  1980s, 
however,  began  to  reduce  that  dependence.  For  example,  a  dra- 
matic rise  in  domestic  demand  for  automobiles  in  1 989  more  than 
compensated  for  a  sharp  drop  in  exports.  Furthermore,  while 
Seoul's  huge  foreign  debt  left  it  vulnerable  to  changes  in  the  avail- 
ability of  foreign  funds  and  in  international  interest  rates,  Seoul's 
economic  and  debt  management  strategy  was  very  effective. 

South  Korea's  philosophy  concerning  direct  foreign  investment 
had  undergone  several  major  changes  tied  to  the  changing  politi- 
cal environment.  Foreign  investment  was  not  allowed  through  the 
1950s.  In  1962  the  Foreign  Capital  Inducement  Act  established 
tax  holidays,  equal  treatment  with  domestic  firms,  and  guaran- 
tees of  profit  remittances  and  withdrawal  of  principal.  Despite  the 


184 


The  Economy 


provisions  of  the  act,  there  was  little  foreign  investment  activity 
until  after  the  establishment  of  diplomatic  relations  between  South 
Korea  and  Japan  in  1965. 

Seoul  had  to  mobilize  both  external  and  internal  sources  when 
it  launched  its  First  Five- Year  Economic  Development  Plan  in  1962. 
The  Foreign  Capital  Inducement  Act  was  amended  in  1966  to  en- 
courage a  greater  inflow  of  foreign  capital  to  make  up  for  insuffi- 
cient domestic  savings.  A  rapid  inflow  of  investment  followed  until 
1973,  when  the  act  was  changed  to  restrict  the  flow  of  investments. 
Beginning  in  the  late  1970s,  however,  the  government  gradually 
began  to  remove  restrictions  as  domestic  industries  began  to  grow 
and  needed  to  be  strengthened  to  cope  with  international  compe- 
tition. But  until  the  early  1980s,  South  Korea  relied  heavily  on  bor- 
rowing and  maintained  a  somewhat  restrictive  policy  towards 
foreign  direct  investment. 

Donald  S .  Macdonald  has  pointed  out  that  under  the  liberaliza- 
tion policy,  restrictions  on  foreign  direct  investment  were  eased 
in  1984  and  1985.  Seoul  changed  its  control  policy  on  foreign  invest- 
ment from  a  *  'positive  list"  to  a  "negative  list"  basis,  which  meant 
that  any  activity  not  specifically  restricted  or  prohibited  was  open 
to  investment.  An  automatic  approval  system  was  introduced  un- 
der which  all  projects  meeting  certain  requirements  were  to  be  im- 
mediately and  automatically  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance. 

Seoul  twice  revised  the  negative  list  system  after  its  initial 
introduction — first  in  September  1985  and  again  in  April  1987 — to 
open  more  industrial  sectors  to  foreign  investors.  In  1984  there  were 
339  items,  or  34  percent  of  the  999  items  on  the  Korean  Standard 
Industrial  Classification,  on  the  negative  list.  As  of  July  1987,  there 
were  788  industrial  sectors  open  to  foreign  investment.  In  the 
manufacturing  sector,  97.5  percent  of  all  industries  (509  out  of  522) 
were  open  to  foreign  investment. 

In  December  1987,  Seoul  announced  a  policy  to  liberalize  the 
domestic  capital  market  by  1992.  The  program  called  for  liberalizing 
foreigners'  investment  funds,  offering  domestic  enterprises  rights 
on  overseas  stock  markets,  and  consolidating  fair  transaction  orders. 
Seoul  planned  to  allow  direct  foreign  investment  in  its  stock  mar- 
ket in  1992. 

Of  the  total  direct  investment  in  South  Korea  from  1962  to  1986, 
which  amounted  to  US$3,631  billion,  Japan  accounted  for  52.2 
percent  and  the  United  States  for  29.6  percent.  In  1987  Japan  in- 
vested US$494  million,  or  44.9  percent  of  the  total  foreign  invest- 
ment of  US$1.1  billion.  Japan  invested  mainly  in  hotels  and 
tourism,  followed  by  the  electric  and  electronics  sector.  Direct  in- 
vestment from  the  United  States  showed  a  remarkable  increase  since 


185 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


the  early  1980s,  accounting  for  54.4  percent  of  the  1982-86  total 
investment.  The  United  States  invested  a  total  of  about  US$255 
million,  or  approximately  24  percent  of  the  1987  investment.  Cumu- 
lative United  States  investment  was  about  US$1 .4  billion  by  1988. 

There  was  a  dramatic  rise  in  foreign  investment  in  the  late  1980s. 
Approvals  of  foreign  equity  investments  reached  an  all-time  high 
of  US$1,283  billion  in  1988,  a  16.6  percent  increase  over  1987. 
As  in  previous  years,  approvals  for  Japanese  investments  were  the 
dominant  factor;  they  totaled  US$696  million  (up  41  percent  from 
1987),  followed  by  United  States  investors  with  US$284  million 
(up  1 1  percent),  and  West  European  sources,  US$240  million  (up 
14  percent).  Investment  approvals  in  the  service  sector  doubled  in 
1988  to  US$561  million,  which  included  two  large  Japanese  hotel 
projects  totaling  US$344  million.  Investment  approvals  in  the 
manufacturing  sector,  however,  declined  from  US$775  million  in 
1987  to  US$710  million  in  1988. 

South  Koreans  began  investing  abroad  in  the  1980s.  Before  1967 
there  was  virtually  no  South  Korean  investment  overseas,  but  there- 
after there  was  a  slow  growth  because  of  Seoul's  need  to  develop 
export  markets  and  procure  natural  resources  abroad.  In  the  1970s, 
South  Koreans  invested  in  trading,  manufacturing,  forestry,  and 
construction  industries.  By  the  early  1980s,  a  sharp  reduction  in 
development  projects  in  the  Middle  East  led  to  a  decline  in  South 
Korean  investment  there.  Mining  and  manufacturing  investments 
continued  to  grow  throughout  the  decade.  In  1987,  out  of  a  total 
South  Korean  overseas  investment  of  US$1,195  million  (745 
projects),  US$574  million  was  invested  in  developed  countries  and 
the  remaining  US$621  million  was  invested  in  developing  countries. 

One  of  the  most  noticeable  economic  achievements  in  the  1980s 
was  Seoul's  reversal  of  the  balance  of  payments  deficit  to  a  sur- 
plus. This  improvement  was  largely  attributable  to  strong  over- 
seas demand  for  South  Korean  products  and  to  the  reduction  in 
expenditures  for  oil  imports.  In  addition,  the  "invisible"  trade  ac- 
count (monies  from  tourism  and  funds  sent  home  by  nationals) 
had  improved  considerably  in  the  late  1980s  because  of  temporary 
increases  in  revenue  from  tourism,  receipts  from  overseas  construc- 
tion, and  structural  decreases  in  interest  payments  (see  table  5,  Ap- 
pendix). 

South  Korea's  success  in  achieving  a  balance  of  payments  sur- 
plus, however,  was  not  without  some  drawbacks.  It  led  to  harsh 
trade  disputes  with  the  United  States  and  other  developed  nations, 
as  well  as  to  inflationary  pressures.  To  cope  with  these  problems, 
Seoul  had  to  modify  its  enthusiastic  promotion  of  exports  in  favor 
of  a  policy  restraining  trade  surpluses  within  reasonable  limits.

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

An  important  measure  restraining  the  growing  foreign  trade  im- 
balance between  South  Korea  and  the  United  States  was  Seoul's 
decision  to  revalue  the  won  against  the  United  States  dollar.  A 
stronger  won  made  American  imports  cheaper,  increased  the  cost 
of  South  Korean  exports  to  the  United  States,  and  slowed,  but  did 
not  reverse,  the  growth  in  the  South  Korea-United  States  trade 
deficit  as  of  1989.  The  United  States  pressed  for  further  apprecia- 
tion of  the  won  in  1989.  In  April  1989,  the  United  States  Depart- 
ment of  the  Treasury  accused  South  Korea  of  continued 
'  'manipulation"  of  the  South  Korean  currency  to  retain  an  artifi- 
cial trade  advantage.  South  Korean  officials  and  businesspeople, 
however,  complained  that  the  already  rapid  appreciation  of  the  won 
was  slowing  economic  growth  and  threatening  exports.  In  May 
1989,  South  Korea  avoided  being  called  an  unfair  trader  by  the 
United  States  and  forestalled  possible  United  States  trade  sanctions, 
but  the  nation  paid  a  high  price  by  promising  to  open  up  its  agricul- 
tural market,  ease  investment  by  foreigners,  and  remove  many  im- 
port restrictions  (see  table  6,  Appendix). 

Foreign  Trade  Policy 

Seoul  stated  in  1987  that  its  foreign  trade  policy  was  structured 
for  further  expansion,  liberalization,  and  diversification.  Because 
of  the  paucity  of  natural  resources  and  traditionally  small  domes- 
tic market,  South  Korea  has  had  to  rely  heavily  on  international 
trade  as  a  major  source  of  development.  Seoul  also  sought  to  diver- 
sify trading  partners  to  ease  dependence  on  a  few  specific  markets 
and  to  remedy  imbalances  in  the  present  tendency  to  bilateral  trade. 

Exports  and  Imports 

The  rapid  growth  of  South  Korea's  economy  in  the  late  1980s 
led  to  significant  increases  in  exports  and  imports  (see  table  7 ,  Ap- 
pendix). In  the  wake  of  the  1988  Seoul  Olympics,  South  Korea's 
trade  surplus  exceeded  US$1 1  billion  and  foreign  exchange  revenue 
had  increased  sharply.  Seoul's  trade  with  communist  countries 
surged  in  1988.  Trade  with  Eastern  Europe  was  US$215  million, 
trade  with  China  almost  US$1 .8  billion,  and  trade  with  the  Soviet 
Union  US$204  million. 

In  1989  total  exports  grew  to  US$74.29  billion,  and  imports  to- 
taled US$67.21  billion.  South  Korea's  annual  trade  exceeded 
US$100  billion  for  the  first  time  in  1988,  making  it  the  world's 
tenth  largest  trading  nation. 

During  the  1960s  and  early  1970s,  the  commodity  structure  of 
Seoul's  principal  exports  changed  from  the  production  of  primary 
goods  to  the  production  of  light  industrial  goods.  After  1974  there 


188 


The  Economy 


was  a  rapid  expansion  in  the  production  and  export  of  heavy  in- 
dustrial and  chemical  products.  By  1986  the  share  of  heavy  indus- 
trial and  chemical  products  in  total  exports  had  expanded  to  55.5 
percent  (as  compared  to  18.9  percent  in  1980)  whereas  the  share 
of  light  industrial  products  had  shrunk  to  40.9  percent  (as  com- 
pared to  71.1  percent  in  1980). 

South  Korea  had  depended  greatly  on  the  United  States  and 
Japan  as  its  major  trading  partners,  with  75.6  percent  of  all  ex- 
ports going  to  these  markets  in  1970.  Success  at  diversifying  ex- 
port markets  led  to  a  reduction  in  the  United  States-Japan  export 
market  share  to  55.6  percent  in  1986.  The  Middle  East  accounted 
for  12  percent  of  South  Korea's  export  trade  from  1972  to  1977, 
but  its  share  declined  to  5.2  percent  in  1986  because  of  the  col- 
lapse of  the  construction  boom  in  the  Middle  East  and  the  Iran- 
Iraq  war  (1980-88).  Exports  to  Western  Europe  declined  from  18.8 
percent  in  1979  to  15  percent  in  1986.  Exports  to  developing  areas, 
such  as  Latin  America  (0.8  percent  in  1972;  3.6  percent  in  1986) 
and  Oceania  (0.9  percent  in  1972;  1.4  percent  in  1986),  grew. 

Indirect  Seoul-Moscow  trade  was  estimated  at  about  US$20  mil- 
lion in  1978,  with  Moscow  importing  electronics,  textiles,  and 
machinery  and  exporting  coal  and  timber.  By  the  late  1980s,  South 
Korea's  global  fur  trader,  Jindo,  was  expected  to  produce  US$20 
million  worth  of  fur  garments  annually  in  a  joint  venture  with  the 
Soviet  Ministry  of  Light  Industry.  South  Korean  businesspeople 
were  offered  such  Soviet  products  as  instruments  for  nuclear  en- 
gineering and  technology  for  processing  mineral  ores  and  concen- 
trates. In  the  first  ten  months  of  1989,  bilateral  trade  between  Seoul 
and  Moscow  reportedly  increased  156  percent  from  1988  figures 
to  US$432  million. 

Since  the  early  1960s,  the  structural  pattern  of  imports  had  shown 
changes,  particularly  in  the  relatively  decreasing  share  of  import- 
ed consumer  goods  and  the  accelerated  growth  of  industrial  sup- 
plies and  capital  equipment  imports.  The  share  of  consumer  goods 
imported  in  1962  was  24.1  percent  of  total  imports;  this  share 
declined  to  9.8  percent  of  total  imports  in  1986  because  of  increased 
South  Korean  production  of  these  goods  for  the  domestic  market. 
The  declining  share  of  raw  materials  as  a  percentage  of  imports 
during  the  early  1970s  was  reversed  in  1974  because  of  the  increased 
value  of  oil  imports  (caused  by  the  1973  war  in  the  Middle  East). 
By  1979  crude  oil  was  25  percent  of  South  Korea's  total  import 
requirements.  This  figure  dropped  to  8.4  percent  in  1988  because 
of  the  use  of  other  sources  of  energy  and  the  decline  in  the  price 
of  petroleum  in  the  late  1980s.

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

South  Korean  exports  to  the  United  States  in  1988  rose  to 
US$21.5  billion,  a  17-percent  increase  over  1987;  imports  rose  to 
US$12.8  billion,  a  46-percent  increase  over  the  1987  level.  The  per- 
centage of  total  South  Korean  exports  destined  for  the  United  States 
market  decreased  to  35.3  percent  in  1988  from  38.7  percent  in  1987. 
At  the  same  time,  the  United  States'  share  of  total  South  Korean 
imports  rose  to  24.6  percent,  up  from  21.4  percent  in  1987.  By  1988 
Seoul's  favorable  balance  had  grown  to  more  than  US$8.7  billion. 

In  1989  imports  rose  to  US$57  billion  (up  18  percent  from  1988) 
whereas  exports  reached  US$61  billion,  a  2-percent  increase  from 
1988.  The  trade  surplus  was  reduced  from  US$11.5  billion  to 
US$4.3  billion  and  was  projected  to  decline  even  more.  Invisible 
receipts  rose  10  percent,  but  payments,  mainly  reflecting  a  big  in- 
crease in  South  Korean  travel  abroad,  were  up  20  percent.  Thus, 
the  surplus  on  invisible  trade  was  reduced  from  US$1.3  billion  to 
US$400  million. 

Korea  in  the  Year  2000 
The  Setting 

South  Korea's  high  GNP  growth  rate  during  the  1960s  and  1970s 
was  accompanied  by  growth  in  the  labor  supply  and  a  rising  share 
of  national  product  going  into  capital  formation — from  15  percent 
in  the  early  1960s  to  more  than  30  percent  in  the  late  1970s.  In 
1988  South  Korean  economic  planners  predicted  that  in  the  1990s 
the  share  of  the  GNP  devoted  to  capital  formation  would  not  con- 
tinue to  rise  and,  in  fact,  might  fall  slightly.  Lower  birthrates  and 
an  aging  population  would  result  in  slow  growth  of  the  labor  force. 

In  the  late  1980s,  South  Korean  economic  planners  expected 
growth  to  continue  at  somewhat  reduced  rates  through  2000,  a  result 
of  slower  growth  in  inputs.  Large  increases  in  productivity, 
however,  could  be  expected  to  push  GNP  growth  beyond  1988  lev- 
els. The  rapid  growth  of  exports  had  enabled  the  country  to  special- 
ize in  the  products  it  made  best  and  to  import  those  it  produced 
less  efficiendy.  No  change  in  this  balance  was  foreseen.  However, 
domestic  producers  would  have  to  rely  more  on  the  domestic  mar- 
ket for  growth  than  in  the  past.  Protection  of  domestic  producers 
might  prompt  less  productivity;  but  if  competition  against  foreign 
products  were  allowed,  a  favorable  impact  on  productivity  might 
be  expected. 

The  government  borrowed  heavily  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  to 
finance  economic  development.  By  the  mid-1980s,  South  Korea 
was  one  of  the  world's  major  debtors.  South  Korea  recorded  a 
favorable  balance  of  trade  for  the  first  time  in  1986;  there  was  an 


190 


The  Economy 


even  more  favorable  balance  in  1987.  Funds  generated  from  this 
trade  surplus  allowed  South  Korea  to  reduce  its  total  foreign  debt 
to  US$35.6  billion  by  1987  and  were  expected  to  allow  a  further 
reduction  to  US$23  billion  by  1991.  Since  1986  there  had  been 
a  drastic  change  in  domestic  savings,  with  savings  growing  to  36 
percent  in  1987  as  compared  to  33  percent  in  1986.  The  twin  fac- 
tors of  increasing  debt  and  low  domestic  savings  that  had  threat- 
ened growth  in  the  past  had  been  mitigated  to  a  considerable 
degree. 

The  Role  of  Science  and  Technology 

The  most  important  sources  of  productive  growth  for  South 
Korean  manufacturers  had  traditionally  been  directly  or  indirect- 
ly related  to  the  ability  of  South  Korean  companies  to  acquire  new 
technology  from  abroad  and  to  adapt  it  to  domestic  conditions, 
rather  than  paying  the  cost  of  research  and  development.  However, 
as  Seoul's  industry  and  exports  continued  to  evolve  toward  higher 
levels  of  technology,  domestic  research  and  development  efforts 
needed  to  be  increased.  Fortunately  for  South  Korea,  its  high  lev- 
el of  well-educated  workers,  who  constitute  a  formidable  brain  trust 
for  future  research  and  development,  are  its  major  asset. 

The  Seoul  government  began  investing  in  technology  research 
institutes  soon  after  the  republic  was  established.  The  Korean  Atom- 
ic Energy  Commission  founded  in  1959  was  responsible  for  research 
and  development,  production,  dissemination,  and  management  of 
technology  for  peaceful  applications  of  atomic  energy.  In  the 
mid-1960s,  the  government  established  the  Ministry  of  Science  and 
Technology  to  oversee  all  government  research  and  development 
activities  and  the  Korea  Institute  of  Science  and  Technology  to  func- 
tion as  an  industrial  research  laboratory.  In  the  1970s,  in  order 
to  better  coordinate  research  and  development,  two  scientific  com- 
munities were  established — one  in  Seoul,  the  other  near  Taejon. 
The  Seoul  complex  included  the  Korea  Institute  of  Science  and 
Technology,  the  Korea  Development  Institute  (affiliated  with  the 
Economic  Planning  Board),  the  Korea  Advanced  Institute  of 
Science,  and  the  Korea  Atomic  Energy  Research  Institute.  Plans 
for  the  Daeduk  Science  Town  near  Taejon  were  far  more  ambi- 
tious. Modeled  after  the  Tsukuba  Science  City  in  Japan,  by  the 
late  1980s  the  Daeduk  Science  Town  accommodated  laboratories 
specializing  in  shipbuilding,  nuclear  fuel  processing,  metrology, 
chemistry,  and  energy  research.  The  government  founded  the 
Korea  Advanced  Institute  of  Science  to  develop  and  offer  gradu- 
ate science  programs,  and  it  also  encouraged  universities  to  de- 
velop their  own  undergraduate  programs  in  science.

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

The  tremendous  growth  of  Samsung  since  the  mid-1980s  was 
strong  evidence  of  the  high  productivity  in  such  modern  industries 
as  electronics.  The  group's  total  sales  nearly  doubled  (8.4  billion 
won  to  14.6  billion  won)  between  1984  and  1986,  while  the  num- 
ber of  employees  only  increased  from  122,000  to  147,000.  The  rea- 
son for  this  high  degree  of  productivity  was  South  Korea's  move 
away  from  labor-intensive  industries  to  those  that  were  highly  au- 
tomated. 

South  Korean  planners  realized  that  the  country  needed  to  ad- 
vance quickly  in  such  areas  as  high  technology  if  the  economy  were 
to  grow  while  matching  foreign  competition.  POSCO's  decisions 
to  build  the  Pohang  Institute  of  Science  and  Technology  and  the 
Research  Institute  of  Industrial  Science  and  Technology  were  ex- 
amples of  this  trend.  POSCO  also  used  a  great  deal  of  money  to 
lure  back  more  than  100  top  South  Korean  scientists  and  researchers 
who  had  emigrated  abroad. 

The  Pohang  Institute  of  Science  and  Technology  also  maintained 
a  major  undergraduate  and  graduate  school.  By  1988  the  institute 
had  a  faculty  of  132  teachers,  about  500  undergraduate  students, 
and  approximately  110  graduate  students.  Only  one  of  every  fifteen 
applicants  was  accepted  and  only  those  students  who  scored  in  the 
top  2  percent  of  the  nation's  college  entrance  examinations  were 
allowed  to  apply. 

POSCO's  efforts  represented  a  great  change  from  the  past.  As 
of  the  late  1980s,  many  of  South  Korea's  younger  scientists,  tech- 
nocrats, and  economic  planners  in  had  received  their  graduate  edu- 
cation in  the  United  States.  Throughout  the  1970s  and  1980s,  the 
government  sponsored  the  scientific  and  technical  education  of 
many  graduate  students  at  prestigious  institutions,  such  as  Har- 
vard University  and  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology. 
The  success  of  the  Pohang  Institute  of  Science  and  Technology 
meant  that  many  of  South  Korea's  future  scientific  and  technical 
leaders  would  be  educated  at  home. 

In  1 990  Seoul  announced  an  ambitious  plan  to  promote  science 
and  technology  so  that  high-technology  activities  would  dominate 
the  economy  by  the  year  2000.  The  Ministry  of  Science  and  Tech- 
nology intended  to  coordinate  technology-related  projects  between 
government  and  industry  in  a  variety  of  fields  including  semicon- 
ductors, computers,  chemistry,  and  new  materials. 

The  anticipated  slowdown  in  economic  growth  could  well  be 
counteracted  by  the  continued  high  rate  of  capital  formation,  in- 
creased productivity  of  labor,  and  expansion  of  the  education  sys- 
tem. Until  South  Korea's  per  capita  income  reached  that  of  the  most 
advanced  industrial  nations  and  as  long  as  South  Korea  remained 


192 


The  Economy 


a  4 'follower"  country  benefiting  from  the  experiences  of  others  while 
avoiding  their  mistakes,  it  was  likely  that  strong  growth  would 
continue. 

In  1987  the  Korea  Development  Institute  issued  a  report,  Korea 
Year  2000,  that  profiled  South  Korean  economic  development  in 
2000.  The  Korea  Development  Institute  noted  that  the  industrial 
structure  would  be  highly  developed  and  would  resemble  that  of 
advanced  countries  inasmuch  as  high  value-added  industries,  high- 
technology  industries,  and  soft  industries  grew  relatively  rapidly. 
Further,  changes  in  industrial  structure  were  expected  rapidly  to 
reduce  the  demand  for  unskilled  workers  while  simultaneously  in- 
creasing the  demand  for  professional  and  technical  manpower, 
resulting  in  further  change  of  the  employment  structure. 

The  Korea  Development  Institute  also  noted  that  the  Ministry 
of  Science  and  Technology  had  prepared  a  long-range  plan  of 
science  and  technology  for  the  twenty-first  century  that  took  into 
account  limited  available  resources.  Accordingly,  Seoul  selected 
its  comparative  advantage  areas,  including  informatics — 
particularly  information  storage  and  retrieval  and  electronic  data 
processing — ,  fine  chemicals,  and  precision  machinery  in  the  short 
term;  biotechnology,  new  materials,  and  public  benefit  areas,  such 
as  the  environment,  health,  and  welfare,  in  the  mid- term;  and 
oceanography  and  aeronautics  for  the  mid-  and  long  term. 

The  Economic  Future 

The  Korea  Development  Institute  also  forecasted  in  1988  that 
South  Korea's  per  capita  GNP  would  exceed  US$10,000  early  in 
the  twenty-first  century.  The  institute  predicted  that  Seoul  would 
enjoy  a  higher  sustained  growth  rate  than  average  through  the 
1990s;  that  the  manufacturing  industry  would  play  a  pivotal  role 
in  the  economy  in  the  twenty-first  century;  and  that  the  service 
industry  would  become  knowledge-intensive  in  order  to  meet  the 
needs  of  a  highly  diversified  industrialized  society.  The  share  of 
the  primary  sector  (agriculture,  forestry,  and  fisheries)  would  sink 
to  nearly  5  percent  by  the  turn  of  the  century,  whereas  the  second- 
ary sector  (industry)  would  rise  to  over  40  percent  and  the  service 
sector  would  be  at  about  55  percent.  Major  areas  of  industrial 
growth  would  include  automobiles,  electronics,  and  machinery. 

In  1988  Kim  Duk-choong  of  Sogang  University  listed  five  main 
points  that  were  expected  to  make  the  "Korean  economic  future 
look  bright."  He  noted  that  South  Korea  had  drastically  reduced 
its  foreign  debts  since  1985,  greatiy  increased  the  rate  of  domestic 
savings,  improved  on  the  equitable  distribution  of  income  through- 
out the  population,  increased  the  role  of  small  and  medium- sized 


193 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

corporations  in  the  economy,  and  made  the  transition  from  a  labor- 
oriented  to  a  technology-oriented  economy.  He  expected  that  these 
positive  economic  developments  would  easily  outweigh  existing 
problems  and  lead  to  real  growth  in  years  to  come. 

Kim's  optimism  had  merit,  but  there  were  other  important  is- 
sues that  could  inhibit  economic  growth,  for  example,  rising  pro- 
tectionist sentiments  in  the  United  States,  Japan,  and  elsewhere. 
Another  problem  was  the  fact  that  the  chaebol  tended  to  restrict  sub- 
contracting and  to  keep  as  much  production  as  possible  inhouse, 
which  meant  that  the  smaller  industries  and  businesses,  which  bore 
the  brunt  of  slowdowns  in  Japan,  would  not  be  able  to  act  as  shock 
absorbers.  Moreover,  as  South  Korea  moved  up  the  technological 
ladder,  it  would  face  stiff  competition  from  advanced  nations  like 
Japan  and  up-and-coming  nations  like  Thailand.  There  also  was 
the  intangible  problem  of  the  resolve  of  South  Korea's  workers, 
who  labored  six  days  a  week  with  little  vacation  time.  What  effect 
would  a  slackening  of  resolve  have  on  the  South  Korean  worker 
by  the  2000?  In  general,  the  future  of  South  Korea's  economy 
looked  very  bright,  but  there  were  enough  intangibles  to  make  ac- 
curate predictions  difficult  at  best.

Chapter  4.  Government  and  Politics 


Hwaso  Gate,  with  parapet,  Suwon  Castle 


THE  CRISIS  OF  JUNE  1987  brought  public  dissatisfaction  with 
the  Chun  Doo  Hwan  government  to  a  head  (see  The  Demise  of 
the  Chun  Regime,  ch.  1).  The  next  eight  months  saw  the  begin- 
ning of  a  compromise  between  the  ruling  and  opposition  camps 
that  marked  a  potential  watershed  in  South  Korean  politics.  Poli- 
ticians who  had  been  in  exile  or  under  house  arrest  for  many  years 
returned  to  leadership  roles.  The  media,  unleashed  from  both  cen- 
sorship and  official  guidance,  began  a  qualitative  and  quantitative 
explosion.  A  newly  critical  press  probed  previously  hidden  aspects 
of  the  military,  the  national  security  agencies,  and  the  government 
more  aggressively  than  ever  before. 

For  the  first  time  since  the  fall  of  the  Syngman  Rhee  regime  in 
1960,  the  Republic  of  Korea  produced  a  constitution  through 
deliberative  processes  rather  than  through  military  intervention  or 
emergency  measures.  Moreover,  elections  for  the  presidency  in  De- 
cember 1987  and  for  the  National  Assembly  in  April  1988  rede- 
fined the  political  process;  a  minority  president  leading  a  minority 
party  began  a  five-year  term  with  full  awareness  that,  at  least  in 
the  near  term,  compromise  was  necessary  for  political  survival. 

The  search  for  the  political  middle  ground  was  handicapped  by 
external  pressures  upon  ruling  and  opposition  parties  alike.  On 
President  Roh  Tae  Woo's  right,  conservative  bureaucrats,  mili- 
tary leaders,  and  Democratic  Justice  Party  members  held  over  from 
the  Chun  period  watched  the  president  carefully.  During  the  first 
two  years  of  Roh' s  rule,  the  rightists  grew  increasingly  suspicious 
of  the  process  of  compromise  and  upset  with  the  direction  taken 
by  South  Korea's  emerging  left,  both  within  and  outside  of  the 
political  process.  The  traditional  opposition  parties — the  Reunifi- 
cation Democratic  Party  and  the  Party  for  Peace  and  Democracy 
led  by  Kim  Young  Sam  and  Kim  Dae  Jung,  respectively — felt  simi- 
lar pressures  from  younger  and  more  progressive  elements  within 
their  parties,  as  well  as  from  the  more  radical  opposition  outside 
the  political  process.  By  mid- 1989  the  Roh  government  appeared 
to  have  reached  its  limit  of  reform  and  began  to  return  to  earlier 
patterns  of  political  control,  including  the  broad  use  of  the  National 
Security  Act  and  national  security  agencies  to  limit  dissent. 

The  National  Assembly  came  into  its  own  in  the  late  1980s  and 
at  least  temporarily  achieved  the  balance  of  powers  provided  for 
in  the  1987  Constitution.  For  the  first  time  in  South  Korea's  his- 
tory, the  government  party,  as  a  minority  in  the  legislature,  was 


199 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

forced  to  seek  procedural  and  substantive  compromises  with  three 
opposition  parties.  Partisan  conflict  was  temporarily  muted  for  the 
Seoul  Olympics  in  September  1988  but  surfaced  again  at  the  end 
of  the  year  in  a  series  of  legislative  committee  hearings  concerning 
corruption  under  Chun.  Further  debate  in  1989  led  to  a  political 
compromise  late  in  the  year  that  resolved  the  question  of  the  "lega- 
cies" of  the  Fifth  Republic  (1980-87)  that  had  animated  politics 
in  the  legislature  since  the  beginning  of  the  Roh  administration. 

A  judicial  revolt  in  mid- 1988  forced  the  resignation  of  a  chief 
justice  appointed  by  the  Chun  administration,  the  subsequent  ap- 
pointment of  a  more  politically  independent  successor,  and  the 
replacement  of  several  dozen  senior  judges.  An  administrative  re- 
form commission  conducted  a  surprisingly  independent  investiga- 
tion of  numerous  government  agencies,  including  the  national 
security  bodies  that  had  long  interfered  in  the  political  process. 

The  pattern  of  politics  outside  the  formal  institutions  of  govern- 
ment continued  to  change  as  the  1990s  began.  New  interest  groups, 
particularly  within  the  intellectual  professions,  emerged  to  challenge 
the  government- sponsored  professional  associations  in  fields  such 
as  journalism,  teaching,  and  the  arts.  These  developments  in  turn 
often  provoked  heavy-handed  responses  from  the  government,  long 
accustomed  to  controlling  professional  organizations  through  na- 
tionwide umbrella  groups.  Cause-oriented  groups  of  various  po- 
litical persuasions  prepared  to  launch  new  parties,  stimulated  by 
the  prospect  of  local  council  elections  to  be  held  in  1990. 

Many  of  the  political  developments  of  the  late  1980s  reflected 
important  and  irreversible  social  and  economic  changes  that  had 
occurred  during  the  previous  two  decades.  As  the  1990s  began, 
a  key  question  of  South  Korean  politics  remained  the  degree  to 
which  the  development  of  a  better-educated  and  more  affluent 
populace — essential  to  South  Korean  modernization,  yet  corrosive 
of  the  older  style  of  political  leadership — would  contribute  to  greater 
political  liberalization. 

The  Constitutional  Framework 

Despite  centuries  of  authoritarian  and  autocratic  rule,  reform 
thinkers  in  nineteenth-century  Korea  had  debated  the  subject  of 
government  and  advocated  the  rule  of  law  and  eventual  constitu- 
tional government  as  early  as  the  1890s.  The  notion  of  a  govern- 
ment limited  by  checks  and  balances  under  a  constitutional  order 
was  not  entirely  new  to  the  Korean  political  setting  in  1945.  Organi- 
zations such  as  the  Self- Strengthening  Society  (Chaganghoe)  used 
translations  to  promote  the  study  of  numerous  European  consti- 
tutions and  legal  codes  during  the  years  just  before  Japan  annexed

Government  and  Politics 


Korea  in  1910.  During  Japanese  rule  (1910-45),  a  self-styled 
Korean  government  in  exile  in  China  drafted  several  charters  and 
constitutions.  Within  colonial  Korea,  a  small  Protestant  commu- 
nity conducted  self-governing  denominational  meetings  in  accor- 
dance with  rules  of  parliamentary  procedure.  Japanese  rule  in 
Korea,  however,  was  itself  largely  exempt  even  from  Japanese  con- 
stitutional constraints  (see  Korea  under  Japanese  Rule,  ch.  1). 
Despite  Korean  interest  in  the  idea  of  constitutionalism,  therefore, 
the  colonial  experience  provided  Koreans  with  little  opportunity 
to  experience  the  practice  of  limited  government. 

Since  the  formation  of  an  independent  South  Korean  republic 
in  1948,  the  term  constitutionalism — as  it  is  popularly  understood 
in  Western  democracies — has  become  a  major  focus  of  political 
strife.  Although  the  concept  has  been  interpreted  in  various  ways, 
there  has  been  at  least  a  nominal  consensus  that  constitutionalism 
would  foster,  if  not  guarantee,  a  general  framework  for  benevo- 
lent and  effective  government.  The  constitution  would  help  protect 
certain  individual  rights  and  provide  safeguards  against  the  con- 
centration of  power  in  the  hands  of  a  dictatorial  group. 

There  have  been  numerous  difficulties  in  adapting  constitution- 
alism to  South  Korea,  not  the  least  of  these  being  the  reluctance 
of  incumbent  leaders  to  step  down  peacefully  and  prepare  for  a 
transfer  of  power  through  the  constitutional  process.  The  politics 
of  constitutional  manipulation  has  been  deadly  serious,  calculated 
to  bolster  or  prolong  the  tenure  of  incumbent  presidents  or  to  lend 
an  aura  of  legitimization  to  a  regime  brought  to  power  by  a  coup 
(see  table  8,  Appendix).  South  Korea  experienced  its  first  peace- 
ful transfer  of  power  since  independence  only  in  1987  (see  Politi- 
cal Dynamics,  this  ch.).  In  most  of  the  leadership  changes  prior 
to  1987,  the  incumbents  used  forceful  tactics — including  martial 
law  and  other  surreptitious  parliamentary  maneuvers — to  change 
the  constitution.  The  1990s  began  with  discussions  of  possible  fur- 
ther changes  in  the  fundamental  law.  It  appeared  that  South  Korea 
had  yet  to  escape  a  pattern  in  which  both  powerholders  and  their 
political  rivals  perceived  a  constitution  as  a  tool  for  holding  power 
rather  than  as  a  framework  for  long-term  governance,  and  in  which 
each  administration  required  one  or  more  constitutional  revisions. 

The  constitutional  framework  of  the  Sixth  Republic,  which  started 
in  1987,  was  based  on  a  constitutional  bill  that  was  passed  by  the 
National  Assembly  on  October  12,  1987,  and  subsequently  approved 
by  93  percent  of  the  voters  in  a  national  referendum  on  October 
28  (see  The  Legislature,  this  ch.).  The  bill  was  the  product  of  pains- 
taking negotiation  and  compromise  among  the  major  political  parties 
in  the  National  Assembly,  unlike  the  preceding  two  constitutions,

which  were  essentially  unilaterally  drafted  by  the  executive  branch 
and  then  submitted  to  referendums  under  emergency  measures  or 
martial  law.  The  1987  Constitution  became  effective  on  February 
25,  1988,  when  Roh  Tae  Woo  was  inaugurated  as  president.  The 
new  Constitution,  which  consisted  of  a  preamble,  130  articles,  and 
supplementary  provisions,  strengthened  the  power  of  the  Nation- 
al Assembly  and  considerably  reduced  the  power  of  the  executive. 
Its  adoption  marked  only  the  second  time  that  the  government  and 
opposition  parties  had  produced  a  constitutional  amendment  bill 
by  consensus  in  South  Korea's  modern  history  and  the  first  time 
that  such  cooperation  had  been  successful  (the  first  occasion,  in 
1980,  was  cut  short  by  a  military  coup  d'etat).  The  new  fundamental 
law,  the  first  since  1960  not  intended  to  extend  the  rule  of  the  in- 
cumbent president,  provided  for  direct  election  of  the  president, 
an  issue  the  opposition  parties  had  campaigned  for  since  1985.  It 
also  eliminated  or  modified  a  number  of  provisions  that  had  come 
under  criticism  since  theyusin  (revitalization)  constitutional  amend- 
ment in  1972. 

The  1987  Constitution  declares  South  Korea  a  democratic  repub- 
lic, its  territory  consisting  of  "the  Korean  Peninsula  and  its  adja- 
cent islands. "  Popular  sovereignty  is  the  norm  of  the  state;  all  public 
officials  are  described  as  servants  of  the  people;  and  the  tenure  and 
political  impartiality  of  these  officials  are  protected  by  the  provi- 
sions of  law.  In  language  not  found  in  earlier  constitutional  amend- 
ments, the  Constitution  states  that  the  "Republic  of  Korea  shall 
seek  unification  and  shall  formulate  and  carry  out  a  policy  of  peace- 
ful unification  based  on  the  principles  of  freedom  and  democra- 
cy." In  another  innovation  clearly  aimed  at  the  past  influence  of 
the  military  on  politics  and  political  succession,  the  Constitution 
stipulates  that  "political  neutrality  shall  be  maintained"  by  the 
armed  forces. 

The  section  on  fundamental  rights  reflects  continued  evolution 
toward  the  affirmation  of  civil  rights  and  due  process  of  law  (see 
Human  Rights,  this  ch.).  Individuals  may  not  be  punished,  placed 
under  preventive  restrictions,  or  subjected  to  involuntary  labor  "ex- 
cept as  provided  by  law  and  through  lawful  procedures. ' '  The  pro- 
tection of  habeas  corpus,  restored  in  the  1980  constitution  but  rarely 
honored  in  practice  in  political  cases  under  the  Chun  government, 
is  further  reinforced.  People  detained  or  arrested  must  be  informed 
of  the  reason  and  of  their  right  to  be  assisted  by  counsel.  Family 
members  of  those  arrested  or  detained  must  be  informed  of  the 
fact  "without  delay."  Prosecutors'  failure  to  indict  a  criminal  sus- 
pect or  accused  person  placed  under  detention  might  entitle  the 
person  to  claim  compensation  for  wrongful  arrest.  Warrants  must

be  issued  by  a  judge  "through  due  procedures"  rather  than  at  the 
mere  request  of  prosecutors,  as  had  often  occurred,  especially  in 
political  cases,  in  the  past.  Other  new  provisions  include  the  right 
of  citizens  to  receive  aid  from  the  state  if  they  suffer  injury  or  death 
because  of  the  criminal  acts  of  others;  the  autonomy  of  institutions 
of  higher  learning;  and  recognition  of  extended  labor  rights. 

The  articles  on  rights,  like  other  portions  of  the  Constitution, 
originated  during  a  process  of  political  compromise  that  deferred 
a  number  of  complex  or  controversial  issues  until  a  later  date.  A 
number  of  new  social  welfare  provisions  were  left  to  subsequent 
legislation.  These  measures  included  aspirations  to  protect  work- 
ing women  from  unjust  discrimination,  state  protection  for  citizens 
incapacitated  by  disease  and  old  age,  environmental  protection 
measures,  housing  development  policies,  and  "protection  for 
mothers"  (see  Public  Health  and  Welfare,  ch.  2). 

As  in  earlier  constitutions,  the  formal  provision  of  a  right  was 
often  qualified  by  other  constitutional  provisions  or  by  related  laws. 
The  most  significant  of  these  pre-existing  laws  was  the  National 
Security  Act,  which  severely  truncated  rights  of  due  process  speci- 
fied in  the  Constitution  and  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  (1954) 
for  persons  accused  of  a  variety  of  political  offenses. 

The  Constitution  affirms  both  the  right  and  the  duty  to  work 
and  requires  legislation  for  minimum  wages  and  standards  of  work- 
ing conditions  to  "guarantee  human  dignity."  Special  protection 


203 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

is  provided  to  working  women  and  working  children.  Except  for 
workers  in  important  defense  industries,  workers  have  the  right 
to  independent  association,  collective  bargaining,  and  collective 
action — a  marked  change  from  the  1980  constitution,  which  stat- 
ed that  collective  action  could  be  regulated  by  law.  By  1990, 
however,  not  all  of  the  numerous  laws  that  restricted  the  exercise 
of  labor  rights  had  been  thoroughly  subjected  to  the  scrutiny  of 
the  Constitution  Court  (see  The  Judiciary,  this  ch.). 

Chapter  Nine  of  the  Constitution,  which  is  concerned  with  the 
economy,  continues  the  theme  of  the  previous  constitution  in  com- 
mitting the  state  to  fostering  economic  growth  and  foreign  trade. 
As  was  the  case  under  the  1980  constitution,  tenant  farming  is  tech- 
nically prohibited,  but  leasing  or  proxy  management  of  farmland 
is  recognized  in  the  interest  of  increasing  agricultural  productivity 
and  rational  land  utilization.  The  new  Constitution  permits  regu- 
lations designed  to  "ensure  the  proper  distribution  of  income"  and 
prevent  "abuse  of  economic  power."  In  an  implicit  recognition 
of  severe  disparities  in  regional  development  in  the  past,  the  state 
is  also  charged  with  ensuring  balanced  development  of  all  regions 
of  the  country.  The  government  is  responsible  for  establishing  na- 
tional standards  and  for  developing  technical,  scientific,  and  hu- 
man resources. 

Separation  of  powers  came  from  the  political  process  as  well  as 
from  the  formal  structure  of  government  embodied  in  the  Consti- 
tution. The  Sixth  Republic's  Constitution  provides  greater  formal 
balance  than  earlier  constitutions  among  the  three  branches  of 
government.  In  important  substantive  areas,  it  strengthens  the  legis- 
lature and  the  judiciary.  In  other  areas,  it  sets  broad  policy  guide- 
lines but  leaves  legislation  to  the  legislators.  The  resulting  formal 
checks  and  balances  were  reinforced  by  the  outcome  of  the  April 
1988  general  elections,  in  which  the  president's  party — the  Demo- 
cratic Justice  Party — lost  a  working  majority  in  the  legislature  for 
the  first  time  since  the  establishment  of  the  Republic  of  Korea. 

The  process  for  amending  the  Constitution  received  public  atten- 
tion in  early  1990  when  the  Democratic  Justice  Party  and  two  of 
the  three  major  opposition  parties  announced  plans  to  merge  and 
to  amend  the  Constitution  to  provide  for  a  cabinet-responsibility 
system.  Proposed  amendments  to  the  Constitution  could  be  intro- 
duced by  the  president  or  by  a  simple  majority  of  members  of  the 
National  Assembly.  A  favorable  vote  of  two- thirds  of  the  National 
Assembly  members  is  required  before  amendments  can  be  placed 
before  a  national  referendum.  To  be  successful,  amendments  re- 
quire a  majority  vote  by  at  least  one-half  of  the  electorate  eligible 


204 


Government  and  Politics 


to  vote  in  general  elections.  An  incumbent  president  may  not  benefit 
from  an  amendment  extending  the  term  of  the  presidency. 

The  Government 
The  Legislature 

The  unicameral  National  Assembly  consists,  according  to  the 
Constitution,  of  at  least  200  members.  In  1990  the  National  Assem- 
bly had  299  seats,  224  of  which  were  directly  elected  from  single- 
member  districts  in  the  general  elections  of  April  1988.  Under 
applicable  laws,  the  remaining  seventy-five  representatives  were 
appointed  by  the  political  parties  in  accordance  with  a  proportional 
formula  based  on  the  number  of  seats  won  in  the  election.  By  law, 
candidates  for  election  to  the  National  Assembly  must  be  at  least 
thirty  years  of  age.  As  part  of  a  political  compromise  in  1987,  an 
earlier  requirement  that  candidates  have  at  least  five  years'  con- 
tinuous residency  in  the  country  was  dropped  to  allow  Kim  Dae 
Jung,  who  had  spent  several  years  in  exile  in  Japan  and  the  Unit- 
ed States  during  the  1980s,  to  return  to  political  life.  The  Nation- 
al Assembly's  term  is  four  years.  In  a  change  from  the  more 
authoritarian  Fourth  Republic  and  Fifth  Republic  (1972-80  and 
1980-87,  respectively),  under  the  Sixth  Republic,  the  National  As- 
sembly cannot  be  dissolved  by  the  president. 

Legislators  are  immune  from  arrest  or  detention,  except  in  cases 
of  flagrante  delicto,  while  the  National  Assembly  is  in  session.  If 
an  arrest  occurs  before  the  National  Assembly  session  begins,  the 
legislator  concerned  must  be  released  for  the  duration  of  the  ses- 
sion. National  Assembly  members  also  enjoy  legal  immunity  for 
statements  made  in  that  forum.  Greater  freedom  of  the  media  and 
independence  of  the  courts,  combined  with  the  power  of  the  oppo- 
sition parties  in  the  legislature,  gave  greater  substance  to  this  im- 
munity during  the  first  two  years  of  the  Sixth  Republic  than  under 
the  preceding  government,  when  prosecutors  and  the  courts  did 
not  honor  such  immunity. 

The  position  of  the  National  Assembly  in  the  Constitution  is 
much  stronger  than  it  had  been  under  the  Fifth  Republic  (see  ta- 
ble 9,  Appendix).  The  annual  session  of  the  National  Assembly 
was  extended  to  100  days.  Extraordinary  sessions  of  thirty  days 
each  might  be  called  by  as  little  as  one-quarter  of  the  membership 
(versus  one-third  in  the  1980  constitution),  and  there  was  no  limit 
on  the  number  of  such  sessions  that  could  be  called  each  year.  The 
power  to  investigate  state  affairs  also  was  strengthened.  The  Na- 
tional Assembly  now  held  the  power  to  remove  the  prime  minister 
or  a  cabinet  minister  at  any  time,  rather  than  having  to  wait  a  year 


205 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


following  appointment,  as  had  been  the  case  before.  The  consent 
of  the  National  Assembly  was  required  for  the  appointment  of  all 
Supreme  Court  justices,  not  just  the  chief  justice.  The  National 
Assembly  performed  a  tie-breaking  function  in  presidential  elec- 
tions and  was  required  to  approve  or  to  disapprove  presidential 
emergency  measures  before  they  took  effect,  time  permitting. 
Failure  to  obtain  National  Assembly  approval  would  void  the  emer- 
gency measures. 

The  Executive 

The  president,  according  to  the  Constitution,  is  head  of  state, 
chief  executive  of  the  government,  and  commander  in  chief  of  the 
armed  forces.  The  Constitution  and  the  amended  Presidential  Elec- 
tion Law  of  1987  provide  for  election  of  the  president  by  direct, 
secret  ballot,  ending  sixteen  years  of  indirect  presidential  elections 
under  the  preceding  two  governments.  Presidential  succession  is 
for  a  single  five-year  term  by  direct  election,  which  must  be  held 
at  least  thirty  days  before  the  incumbent  president  retires.  If  a  pres- 
idential vacancy  should  occur,  a  successor  must  be  elected  within 
sixty  days,  during  which  time  presidential  duties  are  to  be  performed 
by  the  prime  minister  or  other  senior  cabinet  members  in  the  order 
of  priority  as  determined  by  law.  While  in  office,  the  chief  execu- 
tive is  exempt  from  criminal  liability  except  for  insurrection  or 
treason. 

The  president  may,  at  his  own  discretion,  refer  important  poli- 
cy matters  to  a  national  referendum,  declare  war,  conclude  peace 
and  other  treaties,  appoint  senior  public  officials,  and  grant  am- 
nesty (with  the  concurrence  of  the  National  Assembly).  In  times 
of  serious  internal  or  external  turmoil  or  threat,  or  economic  or 
financial  crises,  the  president  may  assume  emergency  powers  "for 
the  maintenance  of  national  security  or  public  peace  and  order." 
Emergency  measures  may  be  taken  only  when  the  National  As- 
sembly is  not  in  session  and  when  there  is  no  time  for  it  to  con- 
vene. The  measures  are  limited  to  the  "minimum  necessary." 

The  1987  Constitution  deleted  the  1980  constitution's  explicit 
powers  to  temporarily  suspend  the  freedoms  and  rights  of  the  peo- 
ple. However,  the  president  is  permitted  to  take  other  measures 
that  could  amend  or  abolish  existing  laws  for  the  duration  of  a  cri- 
sis. It  is  unclear  whether  such  emergency  measures  could  temporar- 
ily suspend  portions  of  the  Constitution  itself.  Emergency  measures 
must  be  referred  to  the  National  Assembly  for  concurrence.  If  not 
endorsed  by  the  assembly,  the  emergency  measures  can  be  revoked; 
laws  overridden  by  presidential  orders  regain  their  original  effect. 
In  this  respect,  the  power  of  the  legislature  is  more  vigorously 


206 


Government  and  Politics 


asserted  than  in  cases  of  ratification  of  treaties  or  declarations  of 
war,  in  which  the  Constitution  simply  states  that  the  National  Assem- 
bly "has  the  right  to  consent"  to  the  president's  actions.  In  a  change 
from  the  1980  constitution,  the  1987  Constitution  stated  that  the 
president  is  not  permitted  to  dissolve  the  National  Assembly. 

The  president  works  out  of  an  official  residence  called  the  Blue 
House,  so  named  because  of  the  building's  blue  roof  tiles.  He  is 
assisted  by  the  staff  of  the  Presidential  Secretariat,  headed  by  a 
cabinet-rank  secretary  general.  Apart  from  the  State  Council,  or 
cabinet,  the  chief  executive  relies  on  several  constitutional  organs 
(see  fig.  12). 

These  constitutional  organs  include  the  National  Security  Coun- 
cil, which  provides  advice  concerning  the  foreign,  military,  and 
domestic  policies  bearing  on  national  security.  Chaired  by  the  presi- 
dent, the  council  in  1990  had  as  its  statutory  members  the  prime 
minister,  the  deputy  prime  minister,  the  ministers  for  foreign  af- 
fairs, home  affairs,  finance,  and  national  defense,  the  director  of 
the  Agency  for  National  Security  Planning  (ANSP,  known  as  the 
Korean  Central  Intelligence  Agency — KCIA — until  December 
1980),  and  others  designated  by  the  president.  Another  body  was 
the  Advisory  Council  for  Peaceful  Unification  Policy,  inaugurat- 
ed in  June  1981  under  the  chairmanship  of  the  president.  From 
its  inception,  this  body  had  no  policy  role,  but  rather  appeared  to 
serve  as  a  government  sounding  board  and  as  a  means  to  disburse 
political  rewards  by  providing  large  numbers  of  dignitaries  and 
others  with  titles  and  opportunities  to  meet  periodically  with  the 
president  and  other  senior  officials. 

The  president  also  was  assisted  in  1990  by  the  Audit  and  Inspec- 
tion Board.  In  addition  to  auditing  the  accounts  of  all  public  insti- 
tutions, the  board  scrutinized  the  administrative  performance  of 
government  agencies  and  public  officials.  Its  findings  were  reported 
to  the  president  and  the  National  Assembly,  which  itself  had  broad 
powers  to  inspect  the  work  of  the  bureaucracy  under  the  provi- 
sions of  the  Constitution.  Board  members  were  appointed  by  the 
president. 

One  controversial  constitutional  organ  was  the  Advisory  Coun- 
cil of  Elder  Statesmen,  which  replaced  a  smaller  body  in  February 
1988,  just  before  Roh  Tae  Woo  was  sworn  in  as  president.  This 
body  was  supposed  to  be  chaired  by  the  immediate  former  presi- 
dent; its  expansion  to  eighty  members,  broadened  functions,  and 
elevation  to  cabinet  rank  made  it  appear  to  have  been  designed, 
as  one  Seoul  newspaper  said,  to  "preserve  the  status  and  position 
of  a- certain  individual.  "  The  government  announced  plans  to 
reduce  the  size  and  functions  of  this  body  immediately  after  Roh's

inauguration.  Public  suspicions  that  the  council  might  provide  for- 
mer President  Chun  with  a  power  base  within  the  Sixth  Republic 
were  rendered  moot  when  Chun  withdrew  to  an  isolated  Buddhist 
temple  in  self-imposed  exile  in  November  1988. 

The  State  Council 

The  top  executive  body  assisting  the  president  in  1990  was  the 


208 


Government  and  Politics 


State  Council,  or  cabinet,  the  members  of  which  in  1990  included 
the  president,  the  prime  minister,  and  from  fifteen  to  thirty  heads 
of  various  ministries  and  their  equivalents.  More  often  a  technocrat 
than  a  politician,  the  prime  minister  is  appointed  by  the  president 
with  the  consent  of  the  National  Assembly.  Other  cabinet  mem- 
bers, also  presidential  appointees,  are  supposed  to  be  recommended 
by  the  prime  minister  but  actually  are  chosen  by  the  president. 
As  was  also  true  under  the  1980  constitution,  no  member  of  the 
military  may  hold  a  cabinet  post  unless  he  is  retired  from  active 
service. 

The  State  Council  is  responsible  for  the  formulation  and  im- 
plementation of  basic  plans  and  policies  concerning  a  wide  range 
of  government  functions.  The  results  of  deliberation  by  the  coun- 
cil are  conveyed  to  the  Presidential  Secretariat  and  the  Office  of 
the  Prime  Minister,  the  two  principal  units  responsible  for  coordi- 
nation and  supervision  relating  to  various  government  agencies. 
Given  the  importance  of  economic  performance  to  the  stability  and 
security  of  the  nation,  the  Economic  Planning  Board  plays  a  sig- 
nificant role  in  the  administrative  and  economic  process.  The 
minister  of  the  board  by  law  doubles  as  deputy  prime  minister; 
his  senior  assistants,  many  of  them  holding  advanced  degrees  from 
foreign  universities,  have  been  among  the  ablest  public  servants 
in  the  country. 

As  South  Korean  observers  have  noted,  the  president's  power 
to  appoint  persons  to  senior  and  deputy  ministerial  positions  not 
only  has  administrative  significance  but  also  is  an  important  polit- 
ical tool  for  balancing  factional  interests  within  the  president's  party 
and  for  rewarding  loyalty.  The  South  Korean  media  closely  scruti- 
nize high-level  appointments  for  clues  to  politics  within  the  ruling 
party.  The  announcement  in  early  1990  of  plans  to  merge  the  rul- 
ing party  and  two  of  the  three  major  opposition  parties  and  to  insti- 
tute a  cabinet-responsibility  form  of  government  produced  even 
more  intensive  interest  in  cabinet  appointments. 

In  1989  a  presidentially  appointed  Administration  Reform  Com- 
mission concluded  a  fourteen-month  study  concerning  the  struc- 
ture of  the  government.  In  reporting  its  findings  to  the  president, 
the  panel  proposed  a  number  of  changes,  including  the  merger  or 
abolition  of  several  State  Council  ministries  and  other  government 
agencies.  Faced  with  strenuous  lobbying  by  officials  of  the  agen- 
cies concerned,  the  ruling  party  and  government  administration 
tabled  most  of  the  recommendations.  Several  proposals  were  im- 
plemented. The  new  Ministry  of  Culture,  established  in  late  1989 
from  the  former  Ministry  of  Culture  and  Information,  was  placed 


209 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


under  the  initial  direction  of  Yi  O-yong,  a  prominent  essayist  and 
literary  critic.  The  new  ministry  continued  the  cultural  and  artis- 
tic functions  of  its  predecessor  and  also  took  over  responsibilities 
concerning  national  and  public  libraries  and  national  language  policy 
from  the  Ministry  of  Education.  The  establishment  of  the  Minis- 
try of  Environment,  upgraded  from  the  former  Office  of  Environ- 
ment within  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Social  Affairs,  acknowledged 
that  national  development  over  the  preceding  three  decades  had 
often  neglected  environmental  concerns.  Its  establishment  redeemed 
a  pledge  made  in  both  the  1980  and  1987  constitutions  that  the 
people  of  South  Korea  ''shall  have  the  right  to  a  healthy  and 
pleasant  environment,"  and  that  the  government  would  take  mea- 
sures for  environmental  protection. 

The  Presidential  Secretariat 

The  Presidential  Secretariat,  often  referred  to  in  the  Western 
media  as  the  Blue  House  staff,  in  1 990  included  a  secretary  general 
of  cabinet  rank  and  six  or  seven  senior  secretaries  with  responsi- 
bility for  political,  economic,  and  other  specialized  areas.  As  in 
other  political  systems,  these  top  aides  enjoyed  special  presiden- 
tial confidence.  They  were  widely  believed  to  control  access  to  the 
chief  executive  and  to  influence  personnel  appointments  and  policy 
decisions. 

The  Judiciary 

The  administration  of  justice  was  the  function  of  the  courts  as 
established  under  the  Constitution  and  the  much-amended  Court 
Organization  Law  of  1949.  A  number  of  provisions  of  the  1987 
Constitution  were  intended  to  improve  judicial  independence,  which 
was  long  held,  even  within  the  judiciary  itself,  to  be  inadequate 
(see  Events  in  1988,  this  ch.;  table  10,  Appendix). 

At  the  top  of  the  court  system  in  1990  was  the  Supreme  Court, 
whose  justices  served  six-year  terms,  giving  them  a  measure  of  inde- 
pendence from  the  president,  whose  single  term  was  only  five  years 
(lower-level  judges  served  ten-year  terms.)  All  other  judges  were 
appointed  by  the  Conference  of  Supreme  Court  Justices  and  the 
chief  justice.  This  process  reverses  the  more  centralized  appoint- 
ment process  that  had  been  in  place  since  theyustn  system  of  1972, 
in  which  the  chief  justice  (under  the  direction  of  the  president,  in 
practice)  appointed  lower  court  judges.  All  but  the  chief  justice  may 
be  reappointed.  The  Supreme  Court  is  the  final  court  of  appeal 
in  all  cases,  including  courts-martial;  except  for  death  sentences, 
however,  military  trials  under  extraordinary  martial  law  may  not 
be  appealed. 


210 


Government  and  Politics 


High  Courts  in  Seoul,  Kwangju,  and  Taegu  hear  appeals  against 
decisions  of  lower  courts  in  civil  and  criminal  cases.  They  also  may 
assume  jurisdiction  over  litigation  brought  against  government 
agencies  or  civil  officials.  Courts  of  first  instance  for  most  civil  and 
criminal  matters  are  the  district  courts  in  Seoul  and  major  provincial 
cities.  The  Family  Court  in  Seoul  handles  matrimonial,  juvenile, 
and  other  family  law  matters;  in  other  cities  such  issues  are  adju- 
dicated in  the  district  courts. 

The  Constitution  divides  responsibility  for  constitutional  review 
of  laws  and  administrative  regulations  between  the  Supreme  Court 
and  the  Constitution  Court.  The  Supreme  Court  reviews  only  regu- 
lations, decrees,  and  other  enactments  issued  by  the  various  minis- 
tries of  other  government  agencies.  The  constitutionality  or  legality 
of  the  regulation  to  be  reviewed  must  be  at  issue  in  an  ongoing 
trial.  The  Constitution  Court  has  much  broader  powers.  It  decides 
on  the  constitutionality  of  laws  enacted  by  the  National  Assembly 
when  requested  by  a  court  to  aid  in  the  resolution  of  a  trial,  or 
in  response  to  a  constitutional  petition,  which  may  be  brought  by 
any  person  who  has  exhausted  available  legal  remedies.  The  Con- 
stitution Court  also  has  exclusive  power  to  rule  on  the  dissolution 
of  political  parties  and  impeachment  of  the  president,  cabinet  mem- 
bers, and  other  high  officials.  All  nine  members  of  the  Constitu- 
tion Court  must  be  qualified  to  be  judges.  The  president,  National 
Assembly,  and  chief  justice  each  select  three  members  of  the  court's 
nine-member  panel. 

The  Constitution  Court  began  operation  in  late  1988.  Unlike 
its  predecessors,  which  since  the  early  1960s  had  made  only  three 
rulings,  the  new  body  gave  rulings  in  400  of  the  more  than  500 
cases  considered  during  its  first  year.  Most  of  the  cases  heard  were 
constitutional  petitions.  In  a  series  of  major  decisions,  the  court 
declared  unconstitutional  a  law  prohibiting  creditors  from  suing 
the  government,  directed  the  National  Assembly  to  revise  a  por- 
tion of  the  National  Assembly  Law  requiring  independent  candi- 
dates to  pay  twice  the  deposit  of  party- affiliated  candidates,  declared 
the  Act  Concerning  Protection  of  Society  unconstitutional,  and  up- 
held the  constitutionality  of  a  law  prohibiting  third-party  involve- 
ment in  labor  disputes. 

The  Civil  Service 

For  centuries  the  most  honored  profession  in  Korea  was  govern- 
ment service,  which  had  been  more  or  less  preempted  by  the  scholar- 
official  class  (see  Traditional  Social  Structure,  ch.  2).  In  modern 
South  Korea,  however,  the  civil  service  has  lost  some  of  its  earlier 
prestige,  partly  because  financially  rewarding  jobs  have  been  more 


211 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

plentiful  in  private  industry  and  commerce.  Nonetheless,  the  up- 
per levels  of  the  civil  service,  particularly  in  the  economic  minis- 
tries, generally  draw  upon  some  of  the  best-trained  and  most 
technically  competent  members  of  the  population. 

Civil  servants  have  generally  enjoyed  reputations  as  competent 
and  dedicated,  but  the  proverbial  corruption  in  the  bureaucracy 
has  also  unfairly  brought  disrepute  to  the  profession  as  a  whole. 
Efforts  to  eliminate  malfeasance  have  been  continuous,  although 
they  have  been  perhaps  most  pronounced  (in  the  fashion  of  tradi- 
tional Chinese  and  Korean  dynastic  succession)  after  the  assump- 
tion of  power  by  a  new  regime.  The  record  of  reform  often  has 
been  mixed.  In  1980  Chun  Doo  Hwan  announced  a  far-reaching 
program  intended  to  "purify"  the  bureaucracy.  Many  South 
Koreans  welcomed  investigations  of  former  cabinet  ministers  and 
the  confiscation  of  large,  unexplained  fortunes  from  other  leaders, 
such  as  Kim  Chong-p'il,  accused  of  enriching  themselves  under 
the  preceding  Park  Chung  Hee  regime.  Chun  also  dismissed  more 
than  200  high  officials  and  1,000  lower-level  functionaries.  Politi- 
cal motives  were  clearly  evident  in  the  ouster  on  vague  charges  of 
all  opposition  politicians  of  any  prominence  and  in  the  removal 
of  public  officials  and  staff  members  of  state-run  corporations  likely 
to  remain  overly  loyal  to  the  late  president's  political  machine. 

The  anticorruption  reforms  of  Roh  Tae  Woo,  marked  by  great- 
er attention  to  due  process  and  broad  political  participation  than 
those  of  his  predecessor,  won  considerable  public  support.  In  his 
presidential  campaign,  Roh  had  joined  other  presidential  candi- 
dates in  promising  exposure  of  financial  irregularities  under  the 
Fifth  Republic  and  had  pledged  broader  disclosure  of  public  offi- 
cials' assets  through  the  amendment  of  existing  laws.  The  first 
promise  was  largely  honored.  The  question  of  Fifth  Republic  cor- 
ruption was  dealt  with  through  vigorous  prosecution  of  former  high- 
level  officials  and  relatives  of  former  President  Chun  Doo  Hwan 
charged  with  abuse  of  power  or  other  irregularities.  The  opposi- 
tion parties  played  a  major  role  in  the  process  by  participating  in 
an  unprecedented  series  of  National  Assembly  hearings  conduct- 
ed in  late  1988.  These  riveting  sessions,  often  televised,  attracted 
millions  of  viewers,  emptying  the  streets  of  Seoul  while  the  hear- 
ings were  taking  place  and  drawing  greater  members  even  than 
the  broadcast  earlier  in  the  year  of  the  Seoul  Olympics.  By  late 
1989,  the  courts  had  tried  and  sentenced  numerous  Chun  relatives 
and  former  high  officials,  including  a  former  ANSP  chief,  on  var- 
ious corruption  or  influence-peddling  charges. 

Despite  these  successes,  the  disclosure  of  senior  officials'  assets 
remained  an  elusive  goal  as  the  1980s  came  to  a  close,  hampered 


212 


Government  and  Politics 


by  the  lack  of  legal  measures  to  penalize  nondisclosure.  The  Na- 
tional Assembly  had  finally  passed  a  law  concerning  public  owner- 
ship of  property  that  would  require  land  owners  to  register  property 
in  their  true  names,  but  still  had  not  ratified  a  more  controversial 
bill  that  would  impose  stiff  penalties  for  the  failure  of  assembly- 
men, ministers,  and  vice-ministerial  level  officials  to  report  their 
financial  dealings. 

The  civil  service  is  managed  by  the  Ministry  of  Government  Ad- 
ministration. Recruitment  for  the  most  part  occurs  through  com- 
petitive examinations  held  annually  in  two  categories,  "ordinary" 
and  "higher"  examinations.  Those  passing  the  higher  tests  gener- 
ally are  recognized  as  bright  and  able  and  are  loosely  known  as 
members  of  the  so-called  higher  civil  service  examinations  clique. 
They  are  given  preference  in  appointment  and  over  the  years  have 
become  the  nucleus  of  bureaucratic  elites  scattered  in  three  major 
government  functions — general  administration,  foreign  affairs,  and 
the  administration  of  justice.  The  foreign  service  and  judiciary  are 
recruited  through  separate  examination  systems  that  are  extremely 
selective.  Faculty  members  at  state  universities,  although  selected 
according  to  traditional  academic  criteria  rather  than  solely  by  ex- 
amination, also  are  part  of  the  civil  service  system,  as  are  those 
who  have  passed  examinations  to  become  public  school  teachers. 

The  Constitution  provides  that  "all  public  officials  shall  be  ser- 
vants of  the  entire  people  and  shall  be  responsible  to  the  people" 
and  guarantees  the  political  impartiality  of  public  officials.  From 
the  perspective  of  the  citizen  needing  to  do  some  business  in  a  street- 
level  government  office,  however,  the  ethos  of  service  sometimes 
gives  way  to  the  traditional  self-regard  of  the  official,  a  situation 
encapsulated  in  the  traditional  phrase  kwanjon  minbi  (respect  for 
the  official,  contempt  for  the  people).  Political  neutrality  also  has 
been  undercut  by  the  persistence  of  political  and  bureaucratic  pres- 
sures on  civil  servants,  especially  during  national  elections.  These 
pressures  can  be  especially  intense  upon  low-ranking  officials  at 
the  bottom  of  the  bureaucratic  chain  of  command  and  on  those 
officials  in  the  upper  five  of  the  nine  civil  service  grades  who  serve 
as  presidential  appointees. 

In  early  1989,  the  number  of  government  officials  totaled 
700,026,  most  of  whom  worked  for  the  executive  branch  of  govern- 
ment. About  7,200  civil  servants  worked  for  the  judiciary.  The  new 
importance  of  the  National  Assembly  under  the  Sixth  Republic  was 
reflected  in  an  increase  in  staff  hired  by  the  legislative  branch  to 
some  2,700  employees — 500  more  than  during  the  final  year  of  the 
preceding  administration.  In  the  1980s,  about  one-third  of  civil 
service  employees  worked  in  local  government.  The  civil  service 


213 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

still  represents  a  cross  section  of  society.  However,  graduates  of 
the  so-called  big  three  universities — Seoul  National  University, 
Yonse  University,  and  Koryo  University  (more  commonly  called 
Korea  University  in  English) — continue  to  enjoy  an  advantage. 
Graduates  of  these  schools,  all  of  which  are  located  in  Seoul,  con- 
tinue to  have  an  edge  in  gaining  employment  in  the  government 
as  well  as  in  the  private  sector  and  are  disproportionately  represented 
in  the  higher  civil  service  grades. 

Local  Administration 

South  Korea  in  1990  was  divided  into  six  provincial-level  cities — 
the  special  city  (t'ukpyolsi)  of  Seoul  (Soul-t'ukpyolsi  to  Koreans) 
and  the  five  cities  directly  governed  (chikhalsi)  by  the  central 
government — Pusan,  Taegu,  Inch'on,  Taejon,  and  Kwangju — 
and  nine  provinces,  or  to  (see  Glossary),  including  Cheju  Island 
(see  fig.  1).  Major  cities  were  divided  into  wards  (ku)  and  precincts 
(tong).  A  province  was  composed  of  counties  (gun)  and  cities  (si) 
with  a  population  of  more  than  50,000.  A  county  consisted  of  towns 
(up)  with  a  population  of  20,000  and  more  each,  townships  (myon), 
and  villages  (rc).  Both  cities  and  towns  had  further  subdivisions 
designed  to  facilitate  communication  between  government  and  peo- 
ple on  local  community  matters. 

The  need  for  local  self-government  was  first  recognized  in  1948; 
a  local  autonomy  law  was  enacted  in  1949.  It  was  not  until  De- 
cember 1960,  however,  that  local  elections  for  the  mayors  of  Seoul 
and  Pusan,  provincial  governors,  and  local  councils — the  first  in 
Korean  history — were  held.  Under  the  system  in  operation  from 
the  military  coup  d'etat  of  May  1961  until  late  1969,  Seoul,  Pusan, 
and  the  provincial  governments  were  under  the  direct  control  of 
the  central  government.  In  view  of  its  special  importance,  Seoul 
was  controlled  by  the  central  government  and  made  subordinate 
to  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister.  Provincial  administrations  and 
the  special  cities  reported  to  the  Department  of  Local  Affairs  of 
the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs.  Likewise,  administrative  departments 
of  provincial  and  city  governments  maintained  close  contacts  with 
the  regional  and  central  offices  of  the  respective  cabinet  ministries. 
The  police  apparatus  in  each  locale  also  was  administratively  respon- 
sible to  the  National  Police  Headquarters  in  Seoul.  The  mayor  of 
Seoul  was  appointed  by  the  president  and  usually  was  regarded 
as  his  close  confidant.  Heads  of  other  administrative  divisions  were 
recommended  by  the  minister  of  home  affairs  for  presidential  approv- 
al. Mayors  of  ordinary  cities  and  county  chiefs — members  of  the 
civil  service — were  recommended  by  the  provincial  governor  for 
appointment  by  the  president.  Heads  of  towns  and  townships  were 


214 


Government  and  Politics 


named  by  county  chiefs,  heads  of  wards  and  precincts  by  mayors, 
and  village  chiefs  by  heads  of  townships. 

Under  the  system  of  proportionality  in  use  in  the  National  As- 
sembly in  1985,  the  majority  of  the  at-large  seats — two-thirds — 
was  given  to  the  party  that  came  in  first.  This  arrangement  dis- 
proportionately favored  the  government  party,  with  its  traditional 
advantages  of  incumbency.  Thus,  in  the  1985  general  elections, 
the  government  party  ended  up  with  a  little  over  35  percent  of  the 
popular  vote — the  largest  share — but  held  more  than  53  percent 
of  the  seats  in  the  legislature.  Conversely,  the  second-placed  party, 
with  roughly  29  percent  of  the  votes,  occupied  just  over  24  per- 
cent of  the  seats  after  the  at-large  seats  were  distributed.  The  two- 
member  district  system  used  in  1985  also  helped  the  government 
party,  which  had  litde  chance  of  finishing  first  in  many  pro- 
opposition  urban  districts,  but  could  hope  to  win  a  second-place 
seat  (see  table  11,  Appendix). 

In  late  1989,  the  National  Assembly  passed  legislation  designed 
to  increase  local  autonomy  over  the  following  two  years.  Under 
the  newly  amended  Act  Concerning  Local  Autonomy,  local  auto- 
nomy was  to  be  introduced  in  several  phases.  Local  councils  would 
be  elected  by  June  1990.  The  central  government  was  to  continue 
appointing  local  administrative  heads — including  mayors  of  the  six 
special  cities  and  nine  provinces — until  elections  for  those  posts, 
scheduled  for  1991,  could  be  held.  The  government  would  retain 
full  control  over  deputy  heads  of  special  cities  and  provinces  for 
the  first  four  years,  after  which  the  central  government  would  merely 
ratify  the  choices  of  the  mayors  and  provincial  governors.  In  a  last- 
minute  compromise,  the  National  Assembly  acceded  to  the  oppo- 
sition parties'  position,  permitting  political  parties  to  nominate  can- 
didates for  local  elections  either  individually  or  in  coalition  with 
other  parties.  Related  laws  scheduled  for  National  Assembly  consid- 
eration in  1990  were  expected  to  address  other  details  of  local 
government,  including  the  question  of  financial  autonomy. 

Political  Dynamics 

Compromise  and  Reform:  July-December  1987 

The  period  from  late  June  through  December  1987  saw  rapid 
implementation  of  political  reforms  in  an  unusual  mood  of  com- 
promise between  the  ruling  and  opposition  parties.  In  July  the 
government  paroled  357  political  offenders,  amnestied  more  than 
2,000  other  prisoners,  and  restored  full  political  rights  to  promi- 
nent opposition  figure  Kim  Dae  Jung.  In  August  the  National 


215 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

Assembly  established  a  committee  to  study  constitutional  revision. 
Representatives  of  four  parties  took  one  month  to  negotiate  and 
propose  a  draft  constitution  that  incorporated  most  of  the  provi- 
sions long  sought  by  the  opposition  parties:  greater  press  freedom 
and  protection  for  civil  rights,  a  stronger  National  Assembly,  and 
direct  presidential  elections.  After  the  bill  passed  the  National  As- 
sembly, more  than  93  percent  of  the  voters  approved  the  new  draft 
in  a  plebiscite  on  October  28,  1987. 

Anticipating  the  presidential  election  of  December  1987,  the  four 
major  presidential  candidates  (Roh  Tae  Woo,  Kim  Dae  Jung,  Kim 
Young  Sam,  and  Kim  Chong-p'il,  collectively  referred  to  in  the  me- 
dia as  "one  Roh  and  three  Kims")  began  their  informal  campaign- 
ing with  a  series  of  public  appearances  and  speeches  in  October. 

In  April  1987,  Kim  Young  Sam  and  Kim  Dae  Jung  had  led  their 
respective  factions,  who  together  included  seventy-two  National 
Assembly  members,  out  of  the  New  Korea  Democratic  Party 
(NKDP)  to  form  the  Reunification  Democratic  Party  (RDP). 
Summer-long  efforts  to  produce  a  single  RDP  presidential  candi- 
date failed.  By  late  September,  Kim  Young  Sam  was  finally  left 
in  control  of  the  party  when  Kim  Dae  Jung  and  his  followers  depart- 
ed to  form  a  new  party  of  their  own — the  Party  for  Peace  and 
Democracy  (PPD).  Kim  Young  Sam  announced  his  candidacy  on 
October  10,  and  the  RDP  convention  proclaimed  Kim  the  party's 
candidate  on  November  9.  Kim  Chong-p'il  was  affiliated  with  the 
New  Democratic  Republican  Party  (NDRP). 

Hoping  to  benefit  from  the  inability  of  Kim  Dae  Jung  and  Kim 
Young  Sam  to  agree  on  a  unified  candidacy,  Roh  Tae  Woo's 
Democratic  Justice  Party  (DJP)  expected  to  win  the  election  with 
a  plurality  of  1  million  votes  and  sweep  about  45  percent  of  the 
total  vote.  The  party's  strategy  was  based  on  the  substantive  ap- 
peal of  Roh  Tae  Woo's  June  29  declaration  in  favor  of  a  new 
democratic  constitution  and  other  reforms,  along  with  a  massive 
public  relations  campaign.  The  public  relations  campaign — roundly 
scored  by  Roh's  political  rivals — portrayed  the  former  four-star 
general  and  division  commander  (he  had  helped  Chun  depose  the 
army  chief  of  staff  in  December  1979)  as  a  simple,  "ordinary  man" 
who  would  bring  about  a  society  in  which  other  ordinary  people 
could  live  comfortably  and  more  affluently.  The  Roh  campaign 
also  avoided  the  traditionally  strident  slogans  of  South  Korean 
politics,  preferring  promising  phrases  such  as  "Commitment  to 
a  Bright  Future." 

DJP  strategists  seeking  the  youth  vote,  which  accounted  for  nearly 
60  percent  of  the  electorate,  acknowledged  the  party's  likely  problem 


216

with  the  more  opposition-minded  liberal  arts  college  graduates; 
instead,  they  focused  on  segments  of  the  young  population  believed 
to  be  more  easily  won,  such  as  high- school  graduates  and  techni- 
cal college  graduates.  As  the  campaign  continued,  Roh  increas- 
ingly attempted  to  distance  himself  from  his  patron,  Chun  Doo 
Hwan,  admitting  that  the  government  had  committed  torture  and 
"other  mistakes' '  and  affirming  that  not  even  the  head  of  state  could 
be  exempted  in  eradicating  corruption. 

The  other  conservative  candidate,  viewed  by  some  of  the  press 
as  a  "spoiler' '  who  would  take  votes  from  Roh  Tae  Woo,  was  Kim 
Chong-p'il.  Kim's  campaign  used  the  "man  of  experience"  theme 
and  was  structured  around  small  meetings  (especially  outside  his 
native  South  Ch'ungch'ong  Province),  some  larger  rallies,  and  care- 
fully chosen  television  spots  financed  from  the  coffers  of  the  Frater- 
nal Association  of  National  Revitalization  and  by  other  affluent 
and  conservative  South  Koreans.  In  his  speeches,  Kim  criticized 
Roh's  long  association  with  the  evils  of  the  Fifth  Republic  and  out- 
lined a  tentative  program  of  financial  relief  for  farmers,  coal  miners, 
and  others. 

Like  the  other  major  candidates,  Kim  Young  Sam  took  advan- 
tage of  the  liberalized  political  climate  to  begin  his  presidential  cam- 
paign with  a  series  of  public  rallies  even  before  the  October  28 
national  referendum  on  the  new  constitution.  The  failure  to  agree 
with  Kim  Dae  Jung  on  a  unified  opposition  candidacy  required 
a  two-pronged  offensive,  designed  both  to  divert  blame  for  poten- 
tially splitting  the  opposition  vote  in  the  election  and  to  attack  Roh 
Tae  Woo.  The  RDP's  slogans,  "End  Military  Government  with 
Kim  Young  Sam"  and  "A  Man  for  Peace,  Harmony,  and 
Honesty,"  reflected  the  dual  objectives  of  the  campaign.  On  Octo- 
ber 17,  1987,  Kim  told  a  home- town  audience  of  1  million  in  Pu- 
san  that,  unlike  Roh,  he  would  lead  a  corruption-free  government 
that  would  end  a  "long  tradition  of  military-backed  governments" 
and  would  make  appropriate  monetary  and  symbolic  compensa- 
tion to  those  killed  and  wounded  in  the  1980  "civilian  uprising" 
in  Kwangju.  In  a  large  rally  in  Taejon  on  October  24,  Kim  sug- 
gested that  a  Kim  Dae  Jung  candidacy  would  "bring  about  sharp 
confrontation  among  Cholla  and  Kyongsang  people. "  In  keeping 
with  the  name  of  his  party,  Kim  also  publicized  his  plan  for  "Five 
Steps  to  Peaceful  Unification"  on  October  12. 

Kim  Dae  Jung's  populist  campaign  themes  were  national  recon- 
ciliation, a  just  economy,  political  neutrality  of  the  military,  and 
pursuit  of  reunification.  The  platform  struck  a  balance  between 
appeals  to  Kim  Dae  Jung's  hoped-for  constituency  among  work- 
ers, farmers,  and  lower  middle-class  voters  and  reassurances  to 


217

voters  who  feared  that  a  Kim  Dae  Jung  candidacy  could  inflame 
regional  loyalties  or  result  in  vindictive  purges  against  those  who 
held  power  during  the  Fifth  Republic.  One  of  Kim's  sons  directed 
specialized  party  organs  such  as  the  United  Democratic  Youth  As- 
sociation to  attract  younger  voters.  Like  Roh  and  Kim  Young  Sam, 
Kim  Dae  Jung  was  able  to  assemble  1  million  participants  in  ral- 
lies in  Seoul  and  in  home-province  appearances,  while  drawing 
somewhat  smaller  crowds  in  other  provinces. 

In  addition  to  the  four  principal  candidates,  several  minor  par- 
ties also  offered  candidates.  These  included  relative  unknowns,  such 
as  Kim  Son-jok  of  the  Ilche  Party  (Unified  Party),  Sin  Chong-il 
of  the  Hanism  Unification  Party,  and  Hong  Suk-cha  of  the  Social 
Democratic  Party.  Another  candidate,  Paek  Ki-wan,  was  promi- 
nent in  dissident  circles.  Most  of  these  candidates  faded  as  the  cam- 
paign progressed,  eventually  withdrawing  their  candidacy  in 
support  of  one  or  another  major  candidate. 

The  election  results  closely  followed  projections  based  on  the 
regional  origins  of  the  four  major  candidates,  despite  protestations 
by  all  that  regionalism  should  not  divide  the  country.  Of  the  major 
candidates,  Roh  took  36.9  percent  of  the  votes,  Kim  Young  Sam 
28  percent,  Kim  Dae  Jung  26.9  percent,  and  Kim  Chong-p'il  only 
8  percent. 

Losers  in  the  election  had  been  charging  the  government  party 
with  illegal  electioneering  activities  ever  since  it  became  clear  in 
late  September  that  Kim  Dae  Jung  and  Kim  Young  Sam  would 
not  be  able  to  agree  on  a  unified  candidacy.  The  traditional  ad- 
vantages of  incumbency  were  evident  early;  by  October  the  busi- 
ness pages  of  Seoul's  daily  press  were  already  discussing  the 
"election  inflation"  caused  by  election-related  spending,  which  in- 
cluded government  disbursements  for  development  projects.  Such 
spending,  common  in  many  countries  prior  to  elections,  included 
a  substantial  decrease  in  the  price  of  heating  oil,  an  increase  in 
the  official  purchase  price  of  rice,  and  a  salary  increase  for  civil 
servants.  Also  common,  although  by  no  means  limited  to  the  rul- 
ing party,  were  customary  "transportation  costs"  given  to  people 
to  attend  rallies  and  the  wide  distribution  of  small  gifts,  such  as 
the  cigarette  lighters  bearing  Roh  Tae  Woo's  name,  dispensed  by 
the  ruling  party.  Political  cartoonists  could  easily  make  light  of  the 
latter  practice,  probably  because  it  had  been  many  years  since  the 
votes  of  South  Koreans,  even  in  rural  areas,  had  been  swayed  by 
simple  gifts  such  as  a  bowl  of  rice  wine  or  a  pair  of  rubber  shoes. 
One  candidate  seemed  to  sum  up  the  prevailing  attitude  in  remarks 
at  a  mid-November  rally:  "If  they  give  you  money,  take  it.  If  they 


218 


Government  and  Politics 


take  you  to  Mount  Sorak  for  sightseeing,  then  have  a  nice  jour- 
ney. But  on  16  December,  be  sure  to  give  your  vote  to  me." 

More  serious  irregularities  reported  prior  to  and  during  the  elec- 
tions included  acts  of  violence  or  intimidation  against  election  ob- 
servers, biased  television  coverage,  mobilization  of  local  officials 
and  neighborhood  organization  officers  to  encourage  people  to  vote 
for  Roh,  and  fraudulent  handling  of  ballot  boxes.  In  one  working 
class  district  in  Seoul,  for  example,  election  observers  seized  two 
ballot  boxes  being  surreptitiously  brought  in  to  a  polling  station 
on  the  morning  of  the  election.  The  government,  which  removed 
the  observers  by  force  two  days  later,  claimed  that  the  boxes  con- 
tained absentee  ballots,  but  had  no  explanation  for  why  they  were 
delivered  in  commercial  trucks  carrying  fruit,  bread,  and  other  con- 
sumer goods. 

Conversely,  few  election  observers  commented  on  the  intimidat- 
ing effect — no  less  on  potential  voters  than  on  candidates — of  acts 
of  violence  that  repeatedly  occurred  against  all  major  candidates. 
Candidates  were  forced  to  hire  phalanxes  of  bodyguards  with  plastic 
shields  for  protection  against  flying  objects  and  often  were  made 
to  cut  short  public  speeches  during  appearances  in  regional  strong- 
holds of  other  candidates.  In  spite  of  local  abuses,  it  was  difficult 
to  estimate  what  fraction  of  Roh  Tae  Woo's  plurality  of  almost 
2  million  votes,  out  of  23  million  cast,  may  have  been  improperly 
influenced.  Extravagant  claims  of  wholesale  manipulation  in  the 
computerized  vote  tabulation  were  made  difficult  to  assess  by  the 
failure  of  those  who  had  made  such  charges  to  present  convincing 
evidence.  Claims  of  election  rigging  also  were  undercut  at  the  time 
by  the  continued  insistence  of  both  the  Kim  Dae  Jung  and  Kim 
Young  Sam  camps  that  their  candidate  was  the  one  to  whom  the 
election  rightfully  should  have  gone. 

Within  a  week  after  the  election,  public  anger  at  the  outcome 
was  divided.  Protests  continued  against  election  irregularities  but 
were  accompanied  by  increasing  criticism  of  the  two  major  oppo- 
sition leaders  for  their  failure  to  produce  a  unified  candidacy  that 
could  have  defeated  the  government  party  candidate.  The  RDP 
and  PPD,  embarrassed  by  the  fact  that  Kim  Dae  Jung  and  Kim 
Young  Sam  together  received  54  percent  of  the  vote  to  Roh's  36 
percent,  both  apologized  to  the  public,  while  vowing  to  continue 
disputing  the  results  of  the  election.  Both  major  opposition  par- 
ties, together  with  Kim  Chong-p'il's  party,  gradually  turned  their 
attention  to  the  question  of  upcoming  National  Assembly  elections. 

Events  in  1988 

President-elect  Roh  Tae  Woo  outlined  his  1988  political  goals — both 


219 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


old  and  new — in  a  New  Year's  interview.  Some  of  Ron's  comments 
echoed  the  authoritarian  language  of  President  Chun's  1987  New 
Year's  speech,  which  had  typically  called  for  '  'grand  national  har- 
mony" in  which  transcendent  political  leadership  would  see  the 
country  through,  if  only  the  people  would  "rid  themselves  of  all 
vestiges  of  the  old  habit  of  confrontation  and  strife."  Roh  made 
ample  reference  to  traditional  themes,  speaking  of  * ' suprapartisan 
operation  of  national  affairs,"  "rooting  out  corruption,"  and  a 
mixture  of  persuasion  and  "stern  measures,"  if  necessary,  to  bring 
leftist  elements  back  into  the  fold.  Roh  also  seemed  to  promise 
genuine  innovations:  to  eliminate  authoritarian  practices,  to  in- 
vestigate and  punish  people  guilty  of  past  financial  scandals,  to  pro- 
tect the  press  from  harassment  by  law  enforcement  authorities,  to 
reorganize  intelligence  agencies,  to  demilitarize  politics,  and  to 
resolve  the  1980  Kwangju  incident  by  restoring  honor  to  the  vic- 
tims and  providing  remuneration  to  the  bereaved. 

Other  leaders  and  other  political  forces  also  had  their  own  agendas 
for  the  new  year.  Under  the  heading  of  "Liquidating  the  Legacy  of 
the  Fifth  Republic,"  the  opposition  parties  of  Kim  Dae  Jung  and 
Kim  Young  Sam  sought  to  investigate  corruption  in  the  Fifth  Repub- 
lic, to  reexamine  the  Kwangju  incident,  and,  as  well,  demanded 
the  release  of  all  political  detainees  and  the  reform  of  numerous 
laws  that  had  been  used  to  control  nonviolent  political  activity  and 
free  expression.  Like  Roh,  Kim  Dae  Jung's  ability  to  compromise 
was  limited  to  a  degree  by  his  own  desire  not  to  lose  influence  with 
an  offstage  constituency,  in  this  case  the  dissident  community  and 
other  elements  to  his  left.  Kim  Chong-p'il's  presidential  campaign 
had  also  made  use  of  these  themes  in  its  attacks  on  the  govern- 
ment party's  candidate,  Roh  Tae  Woo.  Of  even  greater  importance, 
however,  was  restoration  of  the  reputations  and  professional  careers 
of  numerous  individuals  from  the  Park  Chung  Hee  era  who,  like 
Kim  himself,  had  been  purged  in  1980  during  Chun  Doo  Hwan's 
takeover.  These  individuals  included  more  than  8,800  civil  servants 
and  officers  of  state  corporations  as  well  as  several  dozen  senior 
military  officers  (from  the  army  chief  of  staff  down),  who  had  lost 
both  ranks  and  pensions.  Successful  resolution  of  these  issues  greatiy 
increased  Kim's  ability  to  work  with  the  government  party. 

Other  groups  in  society  had  their  own  expectations.  Members 
of  labor  unions  at  many  of  South  Korea's  large  corporations,  fresh 
from  a  major  campaign  of  strikes  in  late  1987,  hoped  for  the  right 
to  elect  their  own  leaders  and  organize  outside  the  framework  of 
the  government- sponsored  Federation  of  Korean  Trade  Unions 
(see  Interest  Groups,  this  ch.).  Some  dissident  organizations  hoped 
that  the  forthcoming  1988  Seoul  Olympics  could  be  held  jointly 


220

in  P'yongyang  and  Seoul  (see  Foreign  Policy,  this  ch.).  Leftist  stu- 
dents also  sought  opportunities  to  meet  with  North  Korean  stu- 
dents. Some  activist  students  hoped  to  establish  firmer  contacts  with 
farmers  and  the  growing  labor  movement,  while  at  the  violence- 
prone  fringe  of  the  radical  student  movement  others  planned  to 
continue  to  dramatize  their  grievances  through  arson  attacks  against 
United  States  and  South  Korean  government  facilities  (see  Politi- 
cal Extremism  and  Political  Violence,  this  ch.).  Still  other  dissidents 
planned  to  continue  demonstrating  against  the  Roh  government  out 
of  conviction  that  it  was  a  simple  continuation  of  the  previous  mili- 
tarized regimes. 

After  his  inauguration  in  February  1988,  Roh  took  steps  to  honor 
some  of  his  campaign  promises,  appointing  a  woman  to  his  cabi- 
net and  approving  the  rehabilitation  of  thirty-one  generals  dismissed 
in  Chun's  coups  of  1979  and  1980.  Another  commitment,  to  ap- 
point members  of  the  opposition  parties  to  cabinet  posts,  was  not 
met  when  the  two  major  parties  failed  to  propose  names  for  con- 
sideration. Four  of  the  new  cabinet  appointees,  however,  were  from 
the  C holla  provinces. 

Negotiations  among  the  major  political  parties  promptly  began 
over  amending  the  National  Assembly  Election  Law,  one  of  the 
major  political  issues  left  unresolved  in  the  1987  Constitution.  At 


221 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


stake  were  two  variables:  the  size  of  the  electoral  districts  and  the 
degree  of  proportionality.  Each  party  took  a  position  that  it  be- 
lieved would  be  to  its  advantage.  Initially,  the  government  party 
and  Kim  Chong-p'il's  NDRP  favored  different  mixtures  of  large 
and  small  districts.  Kim  Young  Sam's  party  was  divided  between 
its  rural  members,  who  also  favored  multiple-member  districts,  and 
the  leadership,  which  argued  for  single-member  districts.  Kim  Dae 
Jung's  party,  which  in  the  presidential  election  had  swept  all  but 
two  districts  in  Seoul,  hoped  to  use  its  heavily  concentrated  con- 
stituency in  the  Cholla  provinces  to  become  the  largest  opposition 
party  with  a  single-member  district  system. 

The  ruling  party  eventually  shifted  to  a  single-member  district 
formula  close  to  that  proposed  by  the  PPD,  but  finally  withdrew 
from  the  negotiations,  claiming  that  the  other  parties  could  not  come 
to  agreement  in  time.  In  a  manner  reminiscent  of  the  tactics  of 
the  Park  Chung  Hee  era,  the  ruling  party  took  advantage  of  its 
legislative  majority  to  pass  unilaterally  its  own  draft  amendment 
in  a  one-minute  session  held  at  2:00  A.M.  on  March  8,  1988.  The 
newly  amended  law  reinstated  single-member  electoral  districts, 
last  used  in  the  general  election  of  1970.  It  also  diluted  the  ele- 
ment of  proportionality  somewhat  by  reducing  the  number  of  at- 
large  seats  to  75,  or  about  one-fourth  of  the  total  of  299,  and  by 
more  evenly  distributing  them  among  the  participating  parties.  The 
opposition  parties  strongly  protested  (Kim  Dae  Jung's  party  less 
vigorously  than  the  others)  and  then  started  to  prepare  their  cam- 
paigns. 

According  to  most  observers,  the  results  of  the  general  election 
of  April  26,  1988,  set  the  stage  for  a  new  political  drama.  For  the 
first  time  in  South  Korean  history,  the  government  party  lost  its 
working  majority  in  the  legislature.  The  government  party  had 
hoped  to  emerge  victorious,  as  the  two  largest  opposition  parties 
again  split  the  antigovernment  vote.  With  34  percent  of  the  popu- 
lar vote,  however,  the  DJP  held  only  125  seats  (87  district  seats 
and  the  remainder  at-large),  well  under  the  150  needed  for  a  majori- 
ty. Kim  Chong-p'il's  party,  the  NDRP,  ended  up  with  a  total  of 
thirty-five  seats,  enabling  it  to  form  its  own  bargaining  group  in 
the  National  Assembly.  Kim  Young  Sam's  RDP  gained  a  small 
number  of  seats,  but  lost  in  overall  ranking  in  the  larger  body.  Kim 
Dae  Jung's  PPD  took  the  senior  opposition  party  position  with  more 
than  19  percent  of  the  vote  and  23  percent  of  the  total  number  of 
seats  (see  table  12,  Appendix). 

There  were  several  reasons  for  the  upset.  The  government  party 
might  have  made  a  stronger  showing  had  not  Roh,  intent  upon  con- 
solidating his  control  of  a  party  that  still  contained  many  holdovers 


222

from  the  Chun  period,  replaced  one-third  of  incumbent  legisla- 
tors with  political  newcomers.  Because  the  new  candidates  were 
not  able  to  build  up  quickly  the  personal  networks  necessary  for 
success  at  the  district  level,  the  ruling  party  in  effect  gave  up  one 
of  its  strongest  campaign  assets  on  the  eve  of  the  election.  Other 
factors  included  the  ruling  party's  lack  of  a  following  among  younger 
and  better-educated  voters  and  its  failure  to  distance  itself  suffi- 
ciently from  the  Chun  government  (the  former  president's  brother 
was  arrested  on  corruption  charges  one  month  before  the  election). 
Increasing  regionalism  also  played  a  role,  especially  in  the  Cholla 
provinces,  where  the  government  party  candidates  failed  to  win 
a  single  district  seat. 

The  impact  of  the  new  balance  of  political  forces  in  the  National 
Assembly,  characterized  by  the  press  asydsoyadae  (small  ruling  pow- 
er, large  opposition  power),  quickly  became  evident.  Even  before 
the  thirteenth  National  Assembly  convened  in  late  May  1988,  the 
floor  leaders  of  the  government  and  opposition  parties  met  to  agree 
upon  procedures  and  to  discuss  the  release  of  political  prisoners. 
These  four- way  talks  became  common  during  the  next  two  years, 
especially  for  routine  business  matters.  Four- way  talks  also  were 
used  to  negotiate  in  advance  such  political  issues  as  the  distribu- 
tion of  committee  chairmanships  (nine  for  opposition  parties,  seven 
for  the  government  party)  and  the  National  Assembly's  investiga- 
tion of  dozens  of  cases  of  corruption  or  other  irregularities  com- 
mitted under  the  preceding  Fifth  Republic. 

The  judiciary  also  moved  toward  greater  political  independence 
in  1988.  In  June  one-third  of  the  nation's  judges  demanded  that 
the  chief  justice  of  the  Supreme  Court,  Kim  Yong-ch'ol,  resign 
as  a  measure  to  restore  public  trust  in  the  politicized  court  system. 
Two  weeks  after  the  chief  justice  resigned  in  disgrace,  the  two  major 
opposition  parties  abstained  from  the  National  Assembly  vote  to 
confirm  Roh's  first  choice  for  the  vacancy,  thereby  causing  the 
nomination  to  fail.  This  action  resulted  in  the  nomination  of  Yi 
Il-kyu,  a  more  independent-minded  figure  known  for  not  bending 
to  political  pressure.  A  Supreme  Court  justice  during  the  Chun 
presidency — until  his  appointment  was  not  renewed  in  1986 — Yi 
had  won  wide  public  respect  for  overturning  lower  court  rulings 
in  political  cases.  Yi's  appointment  as  chief  justice  led  to  National 
Assembly  approval  of  thirteen  new  Supreme  Court  justices  and 
a  major  reshuffle  of  the  judiciary  in  July  that  affected  some  thirty- 
five  senior  District  Court  and  High  Court  judges.  At  a  meeting 
of  chiefs  of  all  court  levels  in  December  1988  when  the  Supreme 
Court  was  drafting  a  revision  to  the  Court  Organization  Law  that 
would  give  the  judiciary  full  control  over  its  own  budgets,  Chief 


223 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

Justice  Yi  Il-kyu  called  on  the  judiciary  to  "take  a  hard  look  at 
ourselves  for  the  situation  in  which  the  public  felt  distrust  for  the 
judiciary"  and  pledged  that  he  would  "never  tolerate  any  outside 
influence  in  court  proceedings." 

Under  Yi's  leadership,  the  South  Korean  judiciary  became  more 
independent.  This  trend  continued  into  1989,  as  courts  overturned 
the  parliamentary  election  victories  of  two  government  party  can- 
didates on  charges  of  illegal  campaigning  and  sentenced  numer- 
ous former  officials  and  relatives  of  former  President  Chun  Doo 
Hwan  to  prison  terms  on  corruption  and  power- abuse  charges.  In 
another  unprecedented  action  in  late  1989,  a  judge  acting  on  his 
own  initiative  granted  bail  to  a  student  activist  charged  with  violat- 
ing the  National  Security  Act. 

The  Seoul  Olympics,  scheduled  to  begin  in  September  1988,  con- 
tributed to  a  tacit  political  truce  where  the  more  contentious  and 
difficult  political  questions,  such  as  the  revisions  of  "bad  laws" 
sought  by  the  two  larger  opposition  parties,  were  concerned.  The 
primary  focus  of  partisan  politics  during  1988  was  the  settling  of 
old  accounts  concerning  the  Fifth  Republic.  These  issues,  in  turn, 
were  divided  into  two  categories:  questions  related  to  Chun's  sei- 
zure of  power  in  late  1979  and  early  1980,  including  the  Kwangju 
incident,  and  questions  concerning  corruption  and  other  irregular- 
ities during  the  period  of  Chun's  rule  through  1987.  In  July  1988, 
following  the  president's  veto  of  two  bills  that  would  have  expand- 
ed the  legislature's  inspection  powers — for  example,  enabling  the 
National  Assembly  to  order  judicial  warrants  forcing  subpoenaed 
witnesses,  such  as  former  President  Chun,  to  testify — the  govern- 
ment party  agreed  with  the  three  major  opposition  parties  to  hold 
hearings  into  numerous  irregularities  of  the  Fifth  Republic.  Other 
special  committees  established  in  July  were  charged  with  studying 
reunification  policy,  democratization  issues,  problems  of  region- 
alism in  politics,  the  conduct  of  the  Seoul  Olympics,  and  irregular- 
ities in  the  recent  presidential  and  general  elections. 

In  twenty  meetings  held  between  late  September  and  mid- 
December  1988,  the  committee  investigating  corruption  under  the 
Chun  government  interviewed  dozens  of  witnesses,  many  of  them 
high-level  civilian  and  military  officers.  The  televised  hearings  daz- 
zled the  public  with  revelations  concerning  the  suppression  of  me- 
dia independence  in  1980,  the  extortion  of  political  funds  from  large 
corporations,  and  improprieties  connected  with  the  Ilhae  Institute, 
a  charitable  foundation  established  by  Chun  Doo  Hwan  (see  The 
Media,  this  ch). 

The  hearings  had  several  effects.  Pressures  against  the  former 
president  grew  as  the  hearings  continued;  in  late  November  1988, 


224 


Government  and  Politics 


Chun  appeared  on  television  to  apologize  to  the  nation,  taking 
responsibility  for  what  he  termed  the  "tragic  consequences"  in 
Kwangju  in  1980.  He  also  stated  that  he  would  surrender  US$24 
million  in  cash  and  property  and  announced  that  he  would  seek 
seclusion  in  a  Buddhist  monastery  in  repentance.  The  hearings  led 
to  subsequent  criminal  prosecutions  of  numerous  members  of 
Chun's  family,  as  well  as  former  high  officials,  including  the  former 
director  of  the  Agency  for  National  Security  Planning,  Chang  Se- 
dong.  The  hearings  also  gave  many  South  Koreans  their  first  op- 
portunity to  see  their  legislators  in  action  and  set  a  precedent  for 
future  broadcasts  of  National  Assembly  business. 

The  drama  of  the  hearings  drew  attention  away  from  the  more 
prosaic  business  of  the  National  Assembly,  which  during  the  year 
passed  dozens  of  laws  and  decided  on  a  1989  budget.  Despite  often 
strong  disagreements  among  parties,  these  results  underscored  the 
role  of  four-way  talks  in  the  process  of  political  compromise,  previ- 
ously a  rare  commodity  in  South  Korean  politics.  The  resulting 
de  facto  coalition  foreshadowed  the  merger  of  three  of  the  four  par- 
ties in  early  1990. 

People  dissatisfied  with  Roh's  first  year  as  president  overlooked 
significant  political  factors,  including  the  restraining  impact  of  world 
attention  prior  to  the  1988  Seoul  Olympics  on  Roh's  conduct.  Roh 
did  make  effective  moves  to  consolidate  his  political  position  dur- 
ing the  year,  including  a  series  of  appointments  and  reshuffles 
within  the  Democratic  Justice  Party,  the  cabinet,  and  the  senior 
ranks  of  the  military.  Changed  political  circumstances  in  1989  made 
it  possible  for  Roh  to  move  more  decisively  to  deal  with  opponents 
inside  and  outside  the  National  Assembly. 

Returning  to  the  Politics  of  National  Security,  1989 

In  his  1989  New  Year's  address,  President  Roh  promised  greater 
efforts  in  reaching  out  to  communist  bloc  countries  and  in  improving 
relations  with  the  Democratic  People's  Republic  of  Korea  (North 
Korea).  He  also  emphasized  continued  democratization,  coupled 
with  stability.  The  emphasis  on  stability  was  shared  by  the  NDRP, 
which  in  its  New  Year's  statement  noted  the  need  to  correct  the 
unbalanced  distribution  of  wealth  and  to  eliminate  conflicts  based 
on  regionalism  but  also  rejected  "any  action  to  undermine  political 
and  social  stability."  Both  the  RDP  and  the  PPD  viewed  1989  as 
the  year  for  the  final  resolution  of  Fifth  Republic  issues  and  called 
for  the  appointment  of  a  special  prosecutor  to  investigate  impar- 
tially criminal  charges  stemming  from  the  National  Assembly  in- 
vestigations.

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

The  president's  willingness  to  move  toward  tighter  social  con- 
trols was  given  further  impetus  by  developments  in  the  first  few 
months  of  the  year.  In  February  farmers  angry  over  the  govern- 
ment's liberalization  of  agricultural  trade  staged  large-scale,  some- 
times violent,  demonstrations  in  Seoul.  During  the  same  month, 
the  nationwide  leftist  student  organization,  the  National  Associa- 
tion of  University  Student  Councils  (Chondaehyop)  challenged  the 
government's  desire  to  retain  the  initiative  between  the  two  Koreas 
by  announcing  plans  to  send  members  to  Pyongyang's  World 
Youth  and  Student  Festival  scheduled  for  July.  In  March  a  sub- 
way workers'  strike  paralyzed  commuter  transportation  in  Seoul 
for  seven  days.  Nationwide  labor  unrest  continued  through  April 
with  a  violent  strike  by  Hyundai  shipyard  workers.  Student  demon- 
strators continued  to  match  police  tear  gas  with  Molotov  cocktails 
through  the  early  months  of  the  year.  In  May  the  nation  was 
shocked  when  students  who  had  taken  police  officers  hostage  in 
a  building  at  Tongui  University  in  Pusan  set  a  fire  that  took  the 
lives  of  seven  police  officers  who  had  stormed  the  facility. 

These  events  were  accompanied  by  signs  of  uneasiness  among 
advisers  of  President  Roh.  In  March  a  cabinet  minister,  known 
as  a  spokesman  for  those  in  the  military  seeking  a  crackdown  on 
labor  union  and  student  radicalism,  resigned.  A  week  later,  at 
graduation  ceremonies  of  the  Korea  Military  Academy,  the  acade- 
my superintendent  twice  failed  to  salute  the  president  and  in  his 
speech  complained  that  "people  have  such  confused  perceptions 
about  which  are  hostile  and  which  are  friendly  countries  that  they 
do  not  know  who  our  enemy  is."  Pressures  on  the  president  to 
curb  what  these  and  other  conservatives  in  the  military  and  the 
government  party  believed  was  a  trend  toward  deterioration  in- 
creased further  in  late  March,  when  it  became  known  that  two 
prominent  South  Korean  dissidents  had  traveled  to  P'yongyang, 
where  they  met  with  North  Korean  leader  Kim  II  Sung  and  at- 
tended a  church  service.  These  developments  and  others,  such  as 
the  announcement  in  June  that  a  former  opposition  legislator  had 
made  an  unauthorized  trip  to  North  Korea  in  1988,  gave  the  presi- 
dent the  rationale  to  reverse  another  trend — the  declining  involve- 
ment of  the  national  security  agencies  in  domestic  political  life. 

During  the  political  openness  of  1988,  a  report  of  the  govern- 
ment's Administration  Reform  Commission  had  denigrated  the 
Agency  for  National  Security  Planning,  on  grounds  that  the  agency 
had  in  the  past  "violated  human  rights  on  many  occasions  and 
interfered  in  politics,  thus  incurring  the  condemnation  of  the  pub- 
lic." As  ruling  and  opposition  parties  studied  ways  to  limit  the  agen- 
cy's role  in  domestic  political  surveillance,  the  ANSP  also  appeared 


226 


Government  and  Politics 


to  take  a  new  approach,  announcing  that  it  was  scaling  back  domes- 
tic operations,  sharing  classified  documents  on  external  security 
issues  at  press  conferences,  and  sending  new  agency  directors  to 
pay  respects  to  the  presidents  of  the  opposition  parties.  By  early 
1989,  political  agreement  had  been  reached  on  a  revised  ANSP 
law  that  would  require  the  agency  to  observe  the  right  of  habeas 
corpus,  remain  politically  neutral,  and  end  other  forms  of  inter- 
ference in  domestic  political  life. 

The  president's  response  to  the  growing  political  crisis  of  early 
1989  was  to  grant  a  renewed  mandate  to  the  police  and  security 
agencies.  In  view  of  increasing  attacks  on  police  boxes,  a  long- 
standing program  to  provide  police  with  M- 1 6  rifles  was  stepped 
up  and  new  rules  of  engagement  issued,  permitting  police  to  fire 
in  self-defense  on  Molotov  cocktail- throwing  demonstrators.  In  the 
aftermath  of  the  Tongui  University  incident,  the  National  Assem- 
bly quickly  passed  a  law  providing  special  penalties  for  the  use  of 
Molotov  cocktails.  In  early  April,  the  president  established  a  Joint 
Security  Investigations  Headquarters  to  coordinate  the  work  of 
police,  intelligence,  and  national  security  agencies.  This  organ, 
which  was  in  existence  from  early  April  through  late  June  1989, 
investigated  student  union  groups,  dissident  organizations,  and  an 
antigovernment  newspaper,  eventually  arresting  more  than  500  per- 
sons (including  the  pair  who  had  traveled  to  North  Korea  in  March) 
on  suspicion  of  "aiding  an  antistate  organization" — North 
Korea — under  the  broad  terms  of  the  National  Security  Act. 

The  Joint  Security  Investigations  Headquarters  was  disbanded 
in  June  under  pressure  from  the  National  Assembly.  Public  prose- 
cutors and  the  Agency  for  National  Security  Planning,  however, 
continued  making  arrests  and  pursuing  investigations  into  a  vari- 
ety of  political  activities  on  national  security  grounds.  There  also 
was  a  resumption  of  the  quasi-legal  or  illegal  practices  common 
in  national  security  cases  before  1988:  breaking  into  the  campaign 
headquarters  of  an  opposition  candidate  in  a  by-election  in  July; 
publishing  lists  of  banned  "antistate"  books  even  after  a  civil  court 
ruling  that  such  a  ban  was  illegal;  arresting  people  for  reading  or 
possessing  books  considered  to  be  pro-North  Korean;  arresting  an 
antigovernment  journalist  for  planning  unauthorized  coverage  of 
North  Korea;  and  ignoring  court  orders  to  allow  arrested  political 
detainees  to  meet  with  their  attorneys.  By  the  end  of  1989,  all  people 
who  had  traveled  to  North  Korea  without  authorization  had  been 
convicted  and  sentenced  to  lengthy  prison  terms. 

The  role  of  the  ANSP  was  further  strengthened  during  the  rest 
of  the  year.  As  part  of  a  cabinet  shuffle  in  July,  Roh  appointed 
a  former  high- school  classmate,  with  a  reputation  for  a  hardline 


227 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


approach  as  a  prosecutor  under  the  Fifth  Republic,  as  head  of  the 
ANSP.  In  the  National  Assembly,  discussion  of  amendments  that 
would  ease  sections  of  the  National  Security  Act  and  restrict  the 
powers  of  the  ANSP  were  indefinitely  postponed.  In  September 
the  government  introduced  an  amendment  that  would  enable  the 
ANSP  to  bypass  the  constitutional  guarantees  of  access  to  a  law- 
yer in  national  security  cases.  In  late  1989,  the  government  claimed 
that  342  people  had  been  charged  under  the  National  Security  Act 
during  the  year. 

Parties  and  Leaders 

Unlike  the  two  former  military  leaders  who  had  preceded  him, 
Roh  Tae  Woo  followed  an  indirect  course  to  the  chairmanship  of 
the  Democratic  Justice  Party  (DJP)  and  the  presidency.  A  Korea 
Military  Academy  classmate  of  Chun  Doo  Hwan  and  Chong  Ho- 
yong  and  a  1959  graduate  of  the  United  States  Army  Special 
Warfare  School,  Roh  had  passed  through  a  succession  of  career- 
building  military  commands,  including  a  brigade  of  the  Special 
Warfare  Command,  before  moving  a  regiment  of  his  frontline  Ninth 
Division  into  Seoul  to  support  Chun's  forcible  removal  of  the  army 
chief  of  staff  and  other  senior  military  leaders  on  December  12, 
1979.  As  Chun  consolidated  his  political  position  through  the  spring 
and  summer  of  1980,  he  placed  Roh  in  the  most  politically  sensi- 
tive military  posts,  naming  him  to  be  commander  of  the  Capital 
Garrison  Command  and,  later,  the  Defense  Security  Command. 
After  Chun  became  president  in  1980,  however,  he  retired  Roh 
from  the  military  and  used  him  to  fill  a  series  of  government  posts, 
beginning  with  a  position  as  second  minister  of  political  affairs, 
a  position  that  was  apparently  created  especially  for  Roh.  After 
a  short  period  as  minister  of  sports  in  the  spring  of  1982,  Roh  served 
for  fifteen  months  as  the  minister  of  home  affairs. 

In  retrospect  it  seems  clear  that  Roh's  ability  simultaneously  to 
benefit  by,  yet  distance  himself  politically  from,  his  association  with 
Chun  began  in  mid- 1983  when  he  was  moved  from  the  post  of 
minister  of  home  affairs  to  take  the  chairmanship  of  South  Korea's 
Olympic  Committee,  which  he  held  through  1986.  With  the  Olym- 
pic Committee  portfolio,  Roh  was  able  to  avoid  entanglement  in 
increasingly  tough  police  handling  of  the  student  movement  while 
remaining  in  the  public  eye  as  the  person  who  had  successfully 
managed  the  campaign  to  have  Seoul  selected  as  the  site  of  the  1988 
Games  of  the  XXIV  Olympiad.  After  his  election  to  the  National 
Assembly  in  April  1985,  Roh  emerged  as  a  significant  figure  in 
the  DJP  when  Chun  appointed  him  to  the  party  presidency. 


228 


Government  and  Politics 


At  the  end  of  the  first  two  years  of  the  Roh  presidency,  the  DJP 
was  a  different  party  from  that  bequeathed  by  Chun  in  1981 .  Roh 
had  surprised  political  observers  when  he  dismissed  one-third  of 
the  party's  local  chapter  chairmen  and  denied  the  party's  nomi- 
nation in  the  April  1988  National  Assembly  election  to  126  incum- 
bent party  members  in  favor  of  relatively  unknown  and  new  party 
members.  These  decisions  undoubtedly  cost  the  party  heavily  in 
the  number  of  seats  won,  but  they  also  enabled  Roh  to  begin  to 
reshape  the  party  in  his  own  image.  By  December  1988,  Roh  was 
ready  to  consolidate  his  control  of  the  DJP.  Within  four  days,  Roh 
replaced  twenty  of  twenty- three  cabinet  ministers,  eliminating  vir- 
tually all  those  carried  over  from  the  Chun  administration.  He  also 
reshuffled  the  senior  DJP  leadership,  removing  Park  Chun-kyu, 
a  former  adviser  to  Park  Chung  Hee's  Democratic  Republican 
Party,  from  the  chairmanship. 

The  numerically  dominant  membership,  or  mainstream,  of  the 
DJP  was  made  up  of  figures  from  the  city  of  Taegu  and  North 
Kyongsang  Province,  a  group  sometimes  characterized  by  the  press 
as  the  TK  Mafia,  or  TK  Division  (TK  for  Taegu  and  Kyongsang). 
This  trend  had  become  evident  during  the  Fifth  Republic  under 
Chun  and  within  the  Democratic  Republican  Party  under  Park 
Chung  Hee  before  him.  Roh  also  attempted,  however,  to  replace 
Chun  loyalists  within  the  party  with  individuals  who  were  more 
likely  to  owe  him  their  primary  loyalty.  Roh  supporters  included 
some  members  of  an  influential  subset  of  the  TK  group  made  up 
of  individuals  who  had  graduated  from  Kyongbuk  High  School, 
Roh's  alma  mater.  In  December  1988,  for  example,  all  of  the  presi- 
dent's senior  staff  were  Roh's  fellow  high- school  alumni.  Taegu - 
Kyongsang  ties  also  extended  to  numerous  civil  and  military  posts, 
most  notably  all  army  chiefs  of  staff  after  1980,  one-quarter  of 
director-level  officers  in  the  Korean  National  Police,  and  120  of 
662  prosecutors  in  1989. 

A  second  group  that  supported  the  president  comprised  a  num- 
ber of  older  politicians  whom  the  Seoul  press  termed  the  New  Elders 
Group.  Members  of  this  group  fled  from  North  Korea  in  the  1940s 
or  during  the  Korean  War,  held  senior  positions  in  various  walks 
of  life,  especially  journalism,  and  played  an  important  role  in  rally- 
ing the  votes  of  other  former  North  Koreans  in  Kyonggi  and  Kang- 
won  provinces  in  the  1987  presidential  election.  For  this  service, 
they  were  allowed  to  return  to  political  life,  in  many  cases  for  the 
first  time  since  persons  of  North  Korean  origin  lost  political  in- 
fluence following  the  fall  of  Syngman  Rhee  in  1960  and  the  1961 


229 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

coup  d'etat  of  Park  Chung  Hee.  As  a  group,  they  were  strongly 
anticommunist  and  favored  the  restoration  of  *  'law  and  order"  in 
the  face  of  rising  dissent  in  South  Korean  society. 

Political  alignments  within  the  ruling  party  tended  to  form  around 
personalities  rather  than  ideas  because  of  the  importance  of  per- 
sonal networks  in  South  Korean  society  and  the  fact  that  under 
the  Constitution  Roh  could  not  succeed  himself.  In  August  1989, 
President  Roh  removed  Yi  Chong-ch'an  from  a  senior  party  post. 
Yi,  the  leader  of  a  group  of  DJP  members  hailing  from  the  Seoul 
area,  was  known  to  favor  greater  democracy  within  the  party  and 
to  oppose  revision  of  the  Constitution  to  create  a  cabinet-responsible 
system.  After  the  announcement  in  early  1990  that  the  parties  of 
Kim  Young  Sam  and  Kim  Chong-p'il  would  merge  with  that  of 
Roh  Tae  Woo,  observers  expected  the  roles  both  of  ideas  and  of 
personal  alignments  or  factions  to  be  even  more  significant  in  the 
new,  enlarged  Democratic  Liberal  Party. 

New  Democratic  Republican  Party  (NDRP)  leader  Kim  Chong- 
p'il  had  been  nominated  as  the  presidential  candidate  of  the 
Democratic  Republican  Party  following  Park's  assassination  in  late 
1979,  but  Kim  was  arrested  by  Chun  on  corruption  charges  dur- 
ing the  latter' s  takeover  in  1980.  Kim  was  accused  of  corruption 
and  stripped  of  most  of  his  personal  assets  in  South  Korea.  He  spent 
six  years  in  the  United  States.  In  March  1986,  he  returned  to  South 
Korea  to  attempt  to  reconstruct  Park's  old  party  and  restore  his 
own  political  fortunes.  In  a  series  of  speeches  in  1986  and  1987, 
Kim  spoke  of  the  need  to  continue  the  "revitalizing"  tasks  of  the 
yusin  phase  of  Park  Chung  Hee  (see  South  Korea  under  Park  Chung 
Hee,  1961-79,  ch.  1).  His  appeal  initially  was  to  former  officials, 
cashiered  military  leaders,  and  others  who  had  lost  their  positions 
in  1980.  As  Kim's  message  changed  to  emphasize  his  association 
with  the  beginnings  of  South  Korea's  modern  economic  develop- 
ment in  the  1960s,  he  began  to  attract  some  younger,  conserva- 
tive South  Koreans,  and  many  from  his  native  Ch'ungch'ong 
Province.  By  October  30,  1987,  when  Kim's  NDRP  was  formally 
established,  people  under  the  age  of  forty  made  up  more  than  half 
of  the  party's  3,000  charter  members.  Others  included  the  twenty- 
one  National  Assembly  members  of  the  now  defunct  Korea 
Nationalist  Party,  which  during  the  1980s  had  provided  a  home 
for  political  survivors  of  Park  Chung  Hee's  party. 

Kim  Young  Sam  was  a  veteran  politician  with  a  strong  consti- 
tuency in  Pusan  and  in  South  Kyongsang  Province.  As  a  Nation- 
al Assembly  member  for  the  opposition  New  Democratic  Party 
(NDP)  in  the  1960s,  he  fought  a  series  of  losing  battles  against  Park 
Chung  Hee  on  such  issues  as  normalization  of  relations  with  Japan 


230 


Government  and  Politics 


in  1965.  By  1970  he  had  risen  to  the  top  policy-making  committee 
of  the  NDP.  He  lost  the  party's  nomination  to  political  rival  Kim 
Dae  Jung  in  the  presidential  election  of  1971  but  continued  to  hold 
top  party  posts  through  1979,  when  the  government-dominated 
National  Assembly  expelled  him  after  he  called  for  the  resignation 
of  Park  and  the  abandonment  of  the  yusin  system.  This  incident 
contributed  to  large-scale  unrest  in  Pusan  and  nearby  Masan  and 
may  have  indirectly  contributed  to  Park's  assassination. 

Kim  Young  Sam,  like  other  well-known  political  figures,  such 
as  Kim  Chong-p'il  and  Kim  Dae  Jung,  was  banned  from  politics 
in  1980  by  Chun  Doo  Hwan;  he  spent  the  early  1980s  under  house 
arrest.  A  Presbyterian  elder,  Kim  used  the  enforced  leisure  in  well- 
publicized  self-improvement  along  traditional  cultural  lines  common 
to  exiled  South  Korean  politicians.  He  was  occasionally  photo- 
graphed while  practicing  calligraphy  in  his  book-lined  study,  or 
while  on  permitted  outings  with  his  Democratic  Alpine  Club. 
Government  censorship  prevented  detailed  press  coverage  of  his 
twenty- three-day  hunger  strike  against  the  Chun  government  in 
May  and  June  1983.  Although  Kim's  house  arrest  was  lifted  after 
the  hunger  strike,  his  political  rights  were  not  restored  until  after 
the  February  1985  National  Assembly  elections.  Kim  subsequent- 
ly joined  his  faction  members  in  the  newly  formed  New  Korea 
Democratic  Party  as  an  official  party  adviser;  his  long-time  rival, 
Kim  Dae  Jung,  directed  his  own  faction  in  the  party  from  outside 
it  as  a  member  of  the  Council  for  Promotion  of  Democracy. 

In  the  late  1980s,  South  Korean  political  observers,  increasing- 
ly interested  in  the  question  of  leadership  succession  within  the  op- 
position parties,  focused  their  attention  more  on  generational 
groupings  than  on  factions.  Seen  this  way,  the  RDP  was  broadly 
divided  into  old-line  Kim  Young  Sam  loyalists  and  some  additional 
experienced  opposition  politicians  in  their  fifties  and  an  emergent 
group  of  younger  politicians,  mostly  in  their  forties.  Many  of  the 
latter  group  began  their  first  terms  in  the  National  Assembly  in 
1988.  They  typically  brought  to  their  political  careers  progressive 
political  credentials  earned  in  human  rights  law,  labor  relations, 
or  other  fields.  Several  members  of  this  group  received  nationwide 
attention  for  their  cogent  interrogation  techniques  during  the  Na- 
tional Assembly  hearings  in  late  1988. 

At  the  time  of  the  presidential  elections  in  December  1987,  sixty- 
two-year-old  opposition  leader  Kim  Dae  Jung  from  the  Cholla 
region  was  in  many  ways  the  South  Korean  political  candidate  best 
known  outside  of  South  Korea.  A  one-time  newspaper  publisher, 
a  Roman  Catholic  of  eclectic  views,  and  a  charismatic  popular 
speaker  elected  to  the  National  Assembly  four  times  in  the  1960s,

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

Kim  had  an  international  reputation  that  stemmed  largely  from 
the  continuous  efforts  of  the  South  Korean  government  to  keep 
him  out  of  the  country,  in  prison,  or  under  house  arrest  following 
his  near- victory  over  Park  in  the  1971  presidential  election.  He 
had  built  active  support  organizations  among  South  Koreans  in 
Japan  and  the  United  States  by  the  time  the  Korean  Central  In- 
telligence Agency  kidnapped  him  at  a  Tokyo  hotel  in  1973.  Fol- 
lowing United  States  intervention  to  save  his  life  during  the 
abduction,  he  was  brought  back  to  South  Korea  to  stand  trial  for 
alleged  violation  of  the  election  law  and  Park's  Emergency  Meas- 
ure Number  Nine.  He  served  several  years  of  imprisonment  and 
house  arrest,  then  was  released  and  had  his  civil  rights  restored 
in  1980  on  the  heels  of  the  October  1979  assassination  of  Park. 

Again  arrested  under  martial  law  in  May  1980,  Kim  Dae  Jung 
was  accused  of  fomenting  the  Kwangju  incident  and  sentenced  to 
death  by  a  military  court  on  sedition  charges  that  the  United  States 
Department  of  State  described  at  the  time  as  "far-fetched"  (see 
The  Kwangju  Uprising,  ch.  1).  Under  pressure  from  the  United 
States  government,  his  death  sentence  was  subsequendy  reduced 
to  life  and  then  to  twenty  years'  imprisonment.  This  term  was  sus- 
pended in  late  1982  when  Kim  went  to  the  United  States  to  seek 
medical  treatment.  In  the  United  States,  Kim  divided  his  time 
among  a  research  appointment  at  Harvard  University,  the  Korean 
Institute  for  Human  Rights  in  Alexandria,  Virginia  (informally 
known  as  the  Kim  Dae  Jung  Embassy),  and  wide-ranging  travels 
to  speak  before  Korean- American  groups  and  United  States  civic, 
academic,  and  human  rights  organizations.  Kim  returned  to  South 
Korea  in  February  1985  on  the  eve  of  the  National  Assembly  elec- 
tions. In  March  1985,  he  was  released  from  the  1980  general  ban 
on  political  activity,  although  the  suspended  criminal  charges  still 
in  effect  meant  that  he  could  neither  belong  to  a  party  nor  run  for 
office.  He  immediately  joined  with  Kim  Young  Sam,  who  had  also 
had  his  ban  lifted,  to  establish  the  Council  for  Promotion  of 
Democracy.  Although  Kim  Dae  Jung  spent  most  of  the  next  two 
years  under  house  arrest,  he  telephonically  provided  informal 
guidance  to  his  faction  within  the  New  Korea  Democratic  Party 
and,  after  April  1985,  within  the  Reunification  Democratic  Party 
(RDP).  As  part  of  the  political  understanding  reached  in  late  June 
1987,  the  government  dropped  all  outstanding  charges  against  him 
and  he  reemerged  to  participate  fully  in  politics.  After  negotiations 
with  the  Kim  Young  Sam  faction  of  the  RDP  failed  to  reach  agree- 
ment concerning  a  unified  candidacy,  the  Kim  Dae  Jung  faction 
and  its  supporters  left  in  October  1987  to  form  the  Party  for  Peace

Government  and  Politics 


and  Democracy  (PPD).  The  December  16  election  was  fast  ap- 
proaching when  Kim  received  his  party's  presidential  nomination

As  the  1990s  began,  the  PPD  was  made  up  of  at  least  three  dis- 
cernible groups.  The  first  group  comprised  old-line  Kim  Dae  Jung 
followers  who  occupied  the  senior  positions  in  the  party  hierarchy 
and  gave  unquestioning  loyalty  to  the  party  leader.  A  second  group, 
making  up  more  than  one-half  of  the  party's  seventy-one  Nation- 
al Assembly  seats  after  the  April  1988  election,  consisted  of  first- 
termers  obliged  by  custom  to  play  a  low-key  role  in  party  affairs 
until  they  acquired  more  political  experience.  Within  this  group, 
however,  was  a  subgroup  of  activists  with  long  experience  in  cause- 
oriented  groups  and  human  rights  law.  Many  of  these  activists  had 
worked  for  the  party  in  the  National  Assembly  elections  in  1985; 
a  few  had  run  as  independents  in  1988  before  formally  joining  the 
party.  Many  of  this  group,  organized  as  the  Study  Group  for  Peace- 
ful and  Democratic  Reunification  (P'yongminyon)  within  the  party, 
participated  conspicuously  in  National  Assembly  hearings  in  1988. 
Collectively,  they  constituted  the  party's  left  wing  and  its  link  with 
the  broader  dissident  movement  outside  of  the  National  Assem- 
bly. Political  speculation  in  late  1989  centered  on  whether  this  group 
would  continue  to  exert  a  leftward  pull,  seeking  to  bring  the  posi- 
tion of  the  PPD  closer  to  that  of  South  Korea's  emergent  left.  Ob- 
servers noted  that  several  PPD  members  of  this  group  also  were 
members  of  the  Coalition  for  a  National  Democratic  Movement 
(Chomminyon)  formed  in  January  1989  and  were  likely  to  be  in- 
volved with  that  organization's  plans  to  form  a  progressive  politi- 
cal party  to  participate  in  the  first  local  council  elections  scheduled 
to  take  place  in  1990. 

Chomminyon  was  one  of  a  variety  of  groups  that  considered  plans 
to  form  cause-oriented  political  parties  in  anticipation  of  local  council 
elections.  These  bodies  included  a  group  of  some  fifty  former  cabinet 
members  and  retired  generals  who  believed  that  the  government 
party  was  not  conservative  enough  and  at  least  two  groups  of  en- 
vironmentalists who  planned  to  establish  parties  dedicated  to  that 
issue.  A  proposed  Green  Party,  like  its  European  counterparts, 
planned  to  emphasize  antiwar  and  antinuclear  issues  as  well  as  the 
cause  of  the  environment,  but  also  supported  a  concept  of  "Oriental 
humanity"  that  would  promote  respect  for  the  elderly  and  other 
traditional  virtues. 

Interest  Groups 

Despite  its  Constitution  and  formal  structure,  the  South  Korean 
government  has  never  fully  conformed  to  the  liberal  democratic 


233 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


model  that  sees  the  state  as  a  simple  summation  of  diverse  and  com- 
peting interests  within  society.  In  politics,  as  in  economic  life,  South 
Korea  has  more  closely  fit  the  "strong  state"  model,  in  which  the 
government  has  tended  to  outweigh  particular  social  or  group  in- 
terests. Nonetheless,  the  balance  between  the  government  and  var- 
ious interest  groups  showed  some  dramatic  changes  in  the  late 
1980s;  as  the  1990s  began,  observers  found  it  likely  that  such 
changes  would  continue,  despite  efforts  by  the  government  to  re- 
tain its  traditionally  strong  position. 

During  most  of  the  postwar  period,  the  South  Korean  gov- 
ernment had  encouraged  organizations  for  the  communication  of 
economic  interests,  but  had  not  encouraged  professional  or  occupa- 
tional interest  groups  to  voice  political  demands.  Independent  or 
unsanctioned  interest  groups  had  come  into  existence  from  time 
to  time  to  challenge  fundamental  policies  of  the  government.  In 
the  late  1980s,  such  challenges  accounted  for  a  sizable  proportion 
of  extragovernmental  political  activity. 

The  relationship  between  government  and  business  associations 
in  South  Korea  had  its  roots  in  the  period  of  Japanese  colonial  rule, 
when  the  governor  general  established  the  Seoul  Chamber  of  Com- 
merce and  Industry  and  other  industrial  associations  as  a  means 
of  communicating  economic  policies  to  the  business  community. 
Since  1952  all  businesses  have  been  required  by  South  Korean  law 
to  belong  to  the  Korean  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  the 
bylaws  and  initial  membership  of  which  closely  paralled  those  of 
the  Seoul  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  of  the  colonial  peri- 
od. Since  1961 ,  when  the  Park  government  began  its  economic  de- 
velopment plans,  the  Federation  of  Korean  Industry  has  represented 
the  major  conglomerates.  A  larger  organization,  the  Federation 
of  Small  and  Medium  Industries,  has  had  much  less  influence.  The 
Korea  Traders'  Association  and  the  Korean  Federation  of  Textile 
Industries  round  out  the  four  major  industrial  associations.  In  1989 
there  were  some  200  additional  business  associations  licensed  by 
the  state  (see  The  Government  and  Public  and  Private  Corpora- 
tions, ch.  3). 

In  most  cases,  the  government  recognizes  only  a  single  associa- 
tion as  the  representative  of  that  industry.  Major  business  leaders 
may  have  individual  access  to  administrators  through  personal  ties 
and  might  be  able  to  influence  the  government  in  minor  ways,  such 
as  obtaining  exemptions  from  specific  taxes.  For  the  most  part, 
however,  business  associations  through  the  1980s  were  dominated 
by  the  government.  As  noted  by  one  specialist,  "It  is  through  in- 
dustry associations  that  the  Korean  government  implements  its  poli- 
cies, enforces  routine  compliance,  gathers  information,  and

monitors  performance."  In  the  1980s,  this  process  was  sometimes 
facilitated  by  the  placement  of  retiring  senior  military  or  national 
security  officials  in  industry  association  positions. 

Institutional  changes  and  pressures  toward  open  markets  began 
to  change  the  traditional  government-business  relationship  in  the 
mid-and  late  1980s.  Larger  corporations  became  interested  in  hav- 
ing a  role  in  policy  formulation  more  commensurate  with  their  con- 
tribution to  more  than  two  decades  of  economic  growth.  This 
interest  took  several  forms,  including  substantial  corporate  con- 
tributions to  all  major  political  parties  during  elections.  As  eco- 
nomic ministries  grew  in  influence  within  a  more  decentralized 
economic  planning  structure  in  the  1980s,  the  related  industry  as- 
sociations gained  a  greater  voice,  just  as  was  true  in  Japan  and 
the  United  States.  Growing  liberalization  of  the  domestic  market 
under  foreign  pressure  also  led  to  greater  friction  between  the  in- 
terests of  specific  economic  sectors  and  the  need  of  the  government 
to  satisfy  its  foreign  critics  or  risk  a  loss  of  access  to  vital  foreign 
markets.  As  the  1990s  began,  these  frictions  seemed  likely  to  con- 
tinue and  to  lead  eventually  to  further  readjustments. 

In  general,  the  higher-paid  professions  establish  and  administer 
their  own  associations  and  cooperate  closely  with  the  appropriate 
government  ministries  but  receive  no  government  support.  These 


235 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

associations  are  chiefly  concerned  with  maintaining  standards  and 
the  economic  status  of  the  professions  concerned  and  have  been 
traditionally  regarded  by  the  government  as  politically  safe.  The 
major  exception  has  been  the  Korean  Bar  Association,  which  be- 
came increasingly  outspoken  on  human  rights  and  related  legal  is- 
sues in  the  1970s  and  1980s. 

The  government  has  attempted  to  keep  tight  controls  on  the  in- 
tellectual professions,  sponsoring  the  formation  of  the  Korean  Fed- 
eration of  Education  Associations  and  the  Federation  of  Artistic 
and  Cultural  Organizations  of  Korea.  Membership  in  the  Korean 
Federation  of  Education  Associations  was  compulsory  for  all 
teachers  through  high-school  level.  Members  of  these  umbrella 
groups  received  significant  medical  benefits,  and  they  tended  to 
avoid  political  controversy.  The  Korean  Newspaper  Association 
and  Korean  Newspaper  Editors'  Association  were  politically  cau- 
tious during  the  early  1980s,  but  became  much  less  constrained 
during  the  early  years  of  Roh's  rule. 

Dissident  associations  have  frequently  grown  from  the  intellec- 
tual sector  of  society.  The  Minjung  Culture  Movement  Associa- 
tion (mtnjung  means  populist)  was  formed  in  1985  by  dissident  artists 
and  writers  who  did  not  want  to  belong  to  the  state-controlled  Fed- 
eration of  Artistic  and  Cultural  Organizations  of  Korea.  Similar 
organizations  of  dissident  journalists,  such  as  the  Association  of 
Journalists  Dismissed  in  1980,  or  the  Democratic  Press  Movement 
Association,  often  were  dealt  with  harshly  under  the  Fifth  Repub- 
lic. The  Association  of  Korean  Journalists,  although  more  broad- 
ly based  and  less  ideological,  was  quick  to  resist  censorship  and, 
after  a  change  in  the  law  in  1988,  supported  the  formation  of  jour- 
nalists' unions. 

The  government  has  been  especially  sensitive  about  unautho- 
rized professional  associations  among  teachers.  Many  teachers,  and 
some  opposition  political  leaders,  have  been  determined  to  reduce 
the  state's  control  over  the  political  views  of  teachers  and  the  con- 
tent of  education.  In  early  1989,  President  Roh  vetoed  an 
opposition- sponsored  amendment  to  the  Education  Law  that  would 
have  allowed  teachers  to  form  independent  unions.  In  spite  of  the 
president's  veto,  activist  leftist  teachers — numbering  about  10  per- 
cent of  the  nation's  primary  through  high-school  faculties — 
announced  their  intention  to  form  such  a  union.  The  National 
Teachers  Union  (Chon'gyojo),  inaugurated  in  late  May  1989,  criti- 
cized the  Korean  Federation  of  Education  Associations  as 
progovernment  and  weak  in  protecting  teachers'  rights  (see  Primary 
and  Secondary  Schools,  ch.  2).  The  Ministry  of  Education  respond- 
ed by  dismissing  more  than  1,000  members  of  the  new  union  in 


236 


Government  and  Politics 


the  spring  and  summer  of  1989,  resulting  in  the  eventual  with- 
drawal of  more  than  10,000  additional  teachers.  The  Agency  for 
National  Security  Planning  conducted  a  well-publicized  investiga- 
tion into  the  union's  ideology,  with  the  implication  that  members 
could  be  charged  with  aiding  an  antistate  organization  under  the 
National  Security  Act.  Police  broke  up  pro-National  Teachers 
Union  rallies;  members  participating  in  a  signature- gathering  cam- 
paign to  support  the  union  were  charged  with  traffic  violations. 
Eventually,  several  teachers'  union  leaders  received  prison  terms 
on  various  charges.  The  Ministry  of  Education  produced  new  guide- 
lines that  permitted  teachers'  colleges  to  deny  admission  to  stu- 
dents with  activist  records  and  that  allowed  district  education  boards 
to  screen  out  "security  risks"  when  testing  candidates  for  employ- 
ment. These  measures  effectively  halted  the  activities  of  the  National 
Teachers  Union. 

The  modern  Korean  labor  movement,  including  unions  of  skilled 
and  unskilled  workers,  dates  to  the  first  decade  of  Japanese  colonial 
rule.  South  Korean  law  and  constitutions  since  1948  have  recog- 
nized the  "three  rights"  of  labor:  the  right  to  organize,  the  right 
to  bargain  collectively,  and  the  right  to  take  collective  action.  In 
practice,  however,  the  government  has  consistently  attempted  to 
control  labor  and  mitigate  the  effects  of  unionism  through  the  use 
of  a  variety  of  legal  and  customary  devices,  including  company- 
supported  unions,  prohibitions  against  political  activities  by  unions, 
binding  arbitration  of  disputes  in  public  interest  industries,  which 
include  70  percent  of  all  organized  labor,  and  the  requirement  that 
all  unions  be  affiliated  with  one  of  the  seventeen  government- 
sponsored  industrial  unions  and  with  a  general  coordinating  body, 
the  Federation  of  Korean  Trade  Unions  (FKTU).  In  the  1980s, 
large  companies,  often  supported  by  the  police  and  intelligence 
agencies  of  the  government,  also  exerted  pressure  on  unions  to  pre- 
vent strikes,  to  undermine  the  development  of  white-collar  unions, 
to  retain  control  of  union  leaders,  and  to  prevent  persons  with  some 
college  education  from  attempting  to  organize  workers  by  taking 
positions  as  industrial  laborers. 

Despite  such  measures,  the  government  has  never  exercised 
total  control  of  the  labor  movement.  Even  the  FKTU  occasionally 
has  been  able  to  file  administrative  suits  against  government  rul- 
ings or  to  lobby — sometimes  successfully — against  laws  that  would 
have  a  negative  impact  on  working  conditions  or  rights  of  unions. 
Through  most  of  its  existence,  however,  the  federation  has  been 
able  to  do  little  beyond  submit  proposals  for  legal  reform  to  the 
government.  Throughout  the  postwar  period,  dissenting  labor  or- 
ganizations either  have  attempted  to  function  apart  from  the 


237 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

government- sanctioned  structure  under  the  FKTU,  or  have  formed 
rival  umbrella  organizations,  such  as  the  National  Council  of  Trade 
Unions,  established  in  1958. 

South  Korea  experienced  an  explosion  of  labor  disputes  from 
1987  through  1989  under  the  more  open  political  conditions  fol- 
lowing the  crisis  of  late  June  1987  and  the  pressures  created  by 
long-deferred  improvements  in  wages  and  working  conditions  (see 
table  13,  Appendix;  Social  Classes  in  Contemporary  South  Korea, 
ch.  2).  More  than  3,500  labor  disputes  occurred  from  August 
through  November  1987.  Most  were  quickly  resolved  by  negotiated 
wage  increases  and  by  the  prospect  that  another  common 
demand — freer  scope  for  union  activities — would  be  met  in  forth- 
coming legislation.  In  1988  labor-related  laws  were  amended  to 
make  it  easier  to  establish  labor  unions  and  to  reduce  government 
intervention  in  labor  disputes.  Unions  were  still  prohibited, 
however,  from  articulating  any  demands  that  the  government  in- 
terpreted as  political  in  nature. 

In  1988  the  number  of  unions  increased  from  4,000  to  more  than 
5,700.  This  figure  included  numerous  new  white-collar  unions 
formed  at  research  institutes,  in  the  media,  and  within  the  larger 
corporations. 

There  was  a  general  privatization  of  labor-management  conflict 
during  1988  and  1989  as  the  government  adopted  a  more  neutral, 
hands-off  stance.  Companies  experimented  widely  with  tactics  such 
as  lockouts  (5  in  1987;  224  in  1988),  and  labor  unions  achieved 
new  levels  of  joint  action  by  workers  in  different  regions  and  in- 
dustries. The  government's  ability  to  manage  organized  labor 
through  the  traditional  means  of  controlling  the  FKTU  declined. 
The  FKTU,  under  criticism  for  the  many  years  it  had  represent- 
ed the  government  more  than  labor,  also  began  to  take  a  more  in- 
dependent posture  as  the  1980s  came  to  a  close.  In  1989  the 
once-docile  umbrella  organization  prepared  to  sponsor  union  can- 
didates in  anticipated  local  elections  (an  illegal  activity  under  ex- 
isting law)  and  held  education  seminars  and  rallies  to  press  for 
"economic  democracy"  through  revision  of  labor  laws  and  other 
reforms.  Notwithstanding  the  increasing  ability  of  labor  to  organize 
and  to  present  economic  demands,  however,  the  government  con- 
tinued to  suppress  leftist  labor  groups  that  appeared  to  have  broad 
political  goals  or  that  questioned  the  legitimacy  of  the  government, 
such  as  the  National  Council  of  Labor  Unions  (Chonnohyop),  which 
was  formally  established  in  early  1990. 

In  early  1990,  the  government  announced  new  measures  to  sup- 
port its  return  to  more  restrictive  policies  governing  strikes.  The 
number  of  intelligence  agents  at  key  industries  was  more  than 


238 


Government  and  Politics 


doubled  (from  163  to  337)  and  a  special  riot  police  task  force — 
sixty-three  companies  in  strength — was  deployed  against  "illegal" 
strikes. 

During  the  postwar  period,  articulation  of  workers'  interests  had 
been  weakest  for  South  Korea's  farming  population.  In  1946  the 
government  used  the  Korea  Federation  of  Peasants  to  mobilize  the 
rural  population  against  leftist  peasant  unions.  The  Federation  of 
Agricultural  Cooperatives,  established  in  1957,  was  also  largely 
funded  and  administered  by  the  state.  Its  purpose  was  not  to 
represent  farmers'  interests  but  to  facilitate  government  control  over 
the  purchase  and  sale  of  grain  and  farmers'  purchases  of  fertilizer. 

Although  most  South  Korean  farmers  continued  to  belong  to 
cooperatives,  two  pressures  converged  in  the  late  1980s  to  change 
the  way  in  which  farmers'  interests  were  represented.  First,  as  rural- 
urban  income  disparities  grew  in  the  late  1970s  and  1980s,  farmer 
dissatisfaction  with  the  government  cooperatives'  role  in  setting 
crop  prices  and  the  costs  of  agricultural  supplies  also  increased  (see 
Agriculture,  ch.  3).  Some  farmers  turned  to  independent  organi- 
zations, such  as  the  Korean  Catholic  Farmers  Association  or  the 
Christian  Farmers  Association.  These  groups,  which  were  viewed 
as  dissident  organizations  by  the  government,  performed  a  varie- 
ty of  services  for  farmers  and  also  took  public  positions  on  govern- 
ment agricultural  and  price  policies,  sometimes  using  mass  rallies. 
The  second  change,  which  affected  larger  numbers  of  farmers,  was 
the  result  of  South  Korea's  growing  trade  surpluses  in  the  late  1980s 
(see  Foreign  Trade  Policy,  ch.  3).  As  the  government  responded 
to  pressure  from  major  trading  partners,  such  as  the  United  States, 
to  open  South  Korea's  domestic  markets,  farmers  became  increas- 
ingly active  in  large-scale  protest  rallies  against  both  the  government 
and  the  major  political  parties.  As  the  1990s  began,  it  was  clear 
that  the  traditional  harmony  of  political  interests  between  a  conser- 
vative rural  population  and  conservative  governments  had  ended. 

Political  Extremism  and  Political  Violence 

The  deliberate  use  of  violence,  including  occasional  assassina- 
tion, to  express  or  advance  political  goals  was  common  among  both 
the  right  and  the  left  in  South  Korea  after  liberation  in  1945  and 
up  to  the  outbreak  of  the  Korean  War  in  June  1950.  Subsequent 
political  violence  up  to  the  1980s,  apart  from  exchanges  between 
police  and  participants  in  political  demonstrations  or  rallies,  was 
largely  limited  to  the  illegal  government  use  of  violence  or  the  threat 
of  violence  to  suppress  dissent  and  intimidate  political  opponents. 
During  the  presidency  of  Syngman  Rhee  (1948-60),  for  example, 
the  government  mobilized  the  Anticommunist  Youth  League  and 


239 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


members  of  street  gangs  to  smash  facilities  of  critical  newspapers 
and  intimidate  opposition  candidates  for  election  (see  The  Syngman 
Rhee  Era,  1948-60,  ch.  1).  The  Park  government  continued  ille- 
gal police  practices,  including  torture  of  some  dissidents,  intellec- 
tuals, and  even  members  of  the  National  Assembly,  and  was  often 
indirectly  involved  in  violence.  The  Korean  Central  Intelligence 
Agency  (KCIA)  also  used  various  means,  including  physical  threats, 
to  intimidate  South  Korean  journalists  in  the  United  States.  Such 
methods  continued  under  Chun,  occasionally  resulting  in  the  deaths 
of  political  defendants  under  police  torture.  Police  were  passively 
present  while  hired  thugs  broke  up  dissident  religious  services  or 
union  meetings.  Under  Roh  Tae  Woo,  police  handling  of  politi- 
cal suspects  retained  some  of  the  illegal  violence  of  earlier  times, 
although  improved  media  freedom  also  meant  greater  scrutiny  of 
police  misconduct.  In  contrast  with  earlier  regimes,  however,  the 
Roh  government  permitted  prosecution  and  conviction  of  police 
officers  and  even  of  military  personnel  in  several  cases  involving 
violence  during  its  first  year  in  office. 

Under  a  special  "afforestation  program"  administered  by  the 
Defense  Security  Command,  more  than  400  student  activists  were 
punitively  induced  into  the  army  during  the  Chun  years.  Accord- 
ing to  a  Ministry  of  National  Defense  report,  at  least  five  commit- 
ted suicide  or  were  killed,  and  many  were  forced  to  become 
informants  (see  The  Defense  Security  Command,  ch.  5).  At  least 
50  people  died  (of  some  10,000  incarcerated)  in  the  government's 
"triple  purity"  (samch'ong)  reeducation  camps  in  the  early  1980s. 
Ten  years  after  the  May  1980  Kwangju  incident,  many  South 
Koreans  continued  to  believe  that  the  initial  violence  committed  by 
armed  Special  Forces  troops  against  civilian  demonstrators  on  that 
occasion  was  deliberate.  The  former  martial  law  commander  for  the 
region  told  a  National  Assembly  committee  in  1988  that  civilian  pro- 
tests were  not  violent  enough  at  the  beginning  to  justify  the  use 
of  elite  forces  and  that  army  brutality  aggravated  the  situation. 

Public  violence  against  government  institutions  was  rare  from 
the  1950s  through  the  early  1980s.  When  students  overthrew  the 
Syngman  Rhee  government  in  April  1960,  mobs  destroyed  the 
headquarters  of  Rhee' s  Anticommunist  Youth  League.  More  spon- 
taneous forms  of  violence  often  occurred  during  student  protest 
rallies  in  the  1950s,  1960s,  and  1970s,  when  small  numbers  of  rock- 
throwing  students  at  the  edges  of  large  rallies  clashed  with  club- 
wielding  riot  police,  or  security  forces  dispatched  martial  arts 
experts  and  plainclothes  officers  to  beat  or  arrest  demonstrators. 
Students  also  occasionally  beat  up  police  informants  or  plainclothes 


240 


Government  and  Politics 


officers.  This  pattern  changed  following  the  killings  of  students  and 
other  demonstrators  in  Kwangju  in  May  1980. 

The  Kwangju  incident  permanently  stained  the  legitimacy  of  the 
Chun  government  for  subsequent  generations  of  student  activists, 
many  of  whom  also  blamed  the  United  States  for  what  they  be- 
lieved to  be  its  supportive  role.  The  use  of  Molotov  cocktails  by 
some  elements  among  student  demonstrators,  both  as  a  counter 
to  increasingly  effective  police  use  of  tear  gas  and  as  a  reflection 
of  increased  militancy,  became  a  feature  of  student  demonstrations 
during  the  1980s. 

Another  threshold  was  crossed  in  March  1982,  when  several  stu- 
dents deliberately  set  a  fire  in  the  American  Cultural  Center  in 
Pusan,  causing  severe  damage  and,  inadvertently,  the  death  of 
another  South  Korean  student  studying  in  the  building  at  the  time. 
In  a  related  statement,  the  students  said  they  were  beginning  an 
anti-United  States  struggle  to  eliminate  United  States  power  from 
South  Korea.  The  students  blamed  the  United  States  for  causing 
"the  permanent  national  division  of  Korea"  and  for  "supporting 
the  military  regime  that  refuses  democratization,  social  revolution, 
and  development." 

In  April  1985,  radical  students,  together  with  veteran  activists 
released  from  prison  the  year  before,  formed  the  Struggle  Com- 
mittee for  the  Liberation  of  the  Masses,  the  Attainment  of  Democra- 
cy, and  the  Unification  of  the  Nation,  or  Sammint'u.  The  ideology 
of  this  organization  borrowed  from  dependency  theory  in  blam- 
ing a  "dependent  industrialization  process"  dominated  by  the  Unit- 
ed States  for  South  Korea's  social  and  political  problems. 
Sammint'u  supported  various  forms  of  direct  action,  including  in- 
filtration of  labor  unions  and  forcible  occupations  of  United  States 
and  South  Korean  government  facilities.  Sammint'u  activists  con- 
ducted a  number  of  such  actions,  including  a  three-day  seizure  of 
the  United  States  Information  Service  (USIS)  building  in  Seoul 
in  May  1985  and  the  occupation  of  two  regional  offices  of  the  Minis- 
try of  Labor  in  November  of  the  same  year.  Although  Sammint'u 
was  suppressed  in  1986  under  the  National  Security  Act  as  an  "anti- 
state"  organization,  its  emphasis  on  well-organized  occupations 
and  other  actions  (rather  than  the  more  spontaneous  forms  of  tradi- 
tional student  protest)  and  its  ability  to  mobilize  students  across 
campus  lines  marked  a  permanent  change  in  student  protest  tac- 
tics (see  College  Student  Activism,  ch.  2). 

By  the  late  1980s,  violence-prone  student  radicals,  although  a 
small  minority  even  among  politically  active  students,  demonstrated 
increasing  effectiveness  in  organizing  occupations  and  arson  as- 
saults against  facilities.  In  1988,  under  the  general  guidance  of  the 


241 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

National  Association  of  University  Student  Councils  (Chondae- 
hyop) and  the  Seoul  Area  Federation  of  Student  Councils 
(Soch'ongnyon),  small  groups  of  students  armed  with  Molotov  cock- 
tails, metal  pipes,  and  occasionally  tear  gas  grenades  or  improvised 
incendiary  or  explosive  devices  and  staged  more  than  two  dozen 
raids  on  United  States  diplomatic  and  military  facilities.  Students 
also  conducted  a  similar  number  of  attacks  against  offices  of  the 
government  and  ruling  party  and  the  suburban  Seoul  residence 
of  former  President  Chun  (see  table  13,  Appendix). 

Anti-United  States  attacks  in  1989  began  in  February  with  a  sei- 
zure of  the  USIS  library  in  Seoul  and  attempted  arson  at  the  Ameri- 
can Cultural  Center  in  Kwangju.  Additional  incidents  continued 
through  the  year  at  about  the  same  level  as  in  1988,  culminating 
in  the  violent  occupation  of  the  United  States  ambassador's  resi- 
dence by  six  students  in  December.  In  the  spring  of  1989,  there 
were  numerous  incidents  of  arson  and  vandalism  against  Hyun- 
dai automobile  showrooms  in  many  cities,  as  Chondaehyop  mobi- 
lized member  organizations  nationwide  to  support  a  strike  by 
Hyundai  shipyard  workers.  Other  attacks  occurred  throughout  the 
year  against  Democratic  Justice  Party  (DJP)  offices  and  South 
Korean  government  facilities. 

As  the  1980s  ended,  however,  violence-prone  radical  groups  also 
suffered  setbacks  and  found  themselves  under  increased  pressure 
from  the  courts,  police,  and  public  and  student  opinion.  The  deaths 
of  seven  police  officers  in  a  fire  set  by  student  demonstrators  in 
Pusan  in  May  1989,  the  arrest  of  Chondaehyop  leaders  on  Na- 
tional Security  Act  charges  stemming  from  the  unauthorized  trav- 
el of  a  member  of  the  organization  to  P'yongyang  over  the  summer, 
and  the  beating  to  death  of  a  student  informer  by  activists  at  one 
university  in  Seoul  in  October  contributed  to  this  pressure.  In  stu- 
dent council  elections  throughout  the  country  in  late  1989,  students 
at  many  campuses  defeated  student  council  officers  associated  with 
the  Chondaehyop's  "national  liberation"  strategy,  often  replac- 
ing them  with  other  leaders  who  favored  a  "people's  democracy" 
approach,  emphasizing  organizational  work  among  farmers  and 
the  labor  movement  over  violent  assaults  on  symbolic  targets,  at 
least  for  the  near  term. 

Many  South  Korean  commentators  interpreted  the  outcome  of 
the  1989  campus  elections  as  a  renunciation  of  violent  methods  or 
as  a  turn  away  from  radical  student  activism.  Other  observers  noted, 
however,  the  ideological  and  organizational  complexity  of  "peo- 
ple's democracy"  elements,  some  of  which  had  in  the  past  equaled 
or  exceeded  Chondaehyop's  commitment  to  violent  activism.  As 
the  1990s  began,  it  seemed  likely  that  at  least  some  radical  elements, 


242 


Government  and  Politics 


although  perhaps  increasingly  driven  underground  like  their  coun- 
terparts in  Japan,  would  remain  committed  to  the  use  of  violence 
as  a  political  tool. 

Human  Rights 

Traditional  Korean  political  thought,  rooted  in  neo-Confucianism, 
placed  some  emphasis  on  benevolent  rule  and  on  the  government's 
paternalistic  responsibility  to  redress  grievances  of  the  population. 
These  ideas  were  carried  further  in  the  nineteenth  century  by  the 
Tonghak  Movement  (tonghak  means  Eastern  Learning),  which  es- 
poused equality  of  the  sexes  and  of  social  classes.  Interest  among 
Koreans  in  modern  human  rights,  however,  and  especially  in  civil 
and  political  rights  protected  by  law  began  late  in  the  Choson  Dy- 
nasty (1392-1910)  with  the  natural  rights  ideas  of  enlightenment 
movement  (kaehwa)  reformers,  such  as  Kim  Ok-kyun,  So  Chae- 
p'il,  and  Pak  Yong-hyo  (see  The  Choson  Dynasty,  ch.  1). 

The  Japanese  colonial  period  (1910-45)  saw  further  diffusion 
of  such  ideas.  In  1919  Koreans  who  had  fled  Japanese  colonial  rule 
established  a  government-in-exile  in  Shanghai  that  affirmed  wide- 
ranging  civil  and  political  rights — freedoms  of  the  ballot,  religion, 
press,  movement,  property,  and  social  and  sexual  equality.  Within 
Korea  in  the  1920s,  labor  and  tenant  farmers  unions  spread  the 
idea  of  rights  and  provided  experience  in  organizational  and  pro- 
test techniques.  As  colonial  rule  continued,  many  Korean  nation- 
alists came  to  assume  the  desirability  of  a  modern  legal  order  and 
due  process  of  law,  especially  while  experiencing  dual  legal  stan- 
dards and  abuses  such  as  torture  and  fabrication  of  evidence  in 
political  cases.  Meanwhile,  Koreans  serving  in  the  colonial  police 
and  receiving  training  in  the  Japanese  Imperial  Army  often  ab- 
sorbed the  increasingly  stringent  and  authoritarian  perspective  of 
Japanese  militarism. 

Human  rights  performance  did  not  immediately  improve  fol- 
lowing the  liberation  of  Korea  from  Japanese  rule  in  1945.  Many 
factors — national  division,  ideological  conflict,  and  violent  confron- 
tation even  before  the  outbreak  of  the  Korean  War  in  1950 — 
contributed  to  this  problem.  Japanese-style  practices  held  over  from 
the  colonial  days  also  were  to  blame.  The  United  States  Army  Mili- 
tary Government  in  Korea  (1945-48),  confronted  with  serious 
problems  of  public  order,  found  itself  retaining  the  old  colonial 
police  apparatus  and  its  Korean  personnel  (see  South  Korea  un- 
der United  States  Occupation,  1945-48,  ch.  1).  United  States- 
sponsored  legal  reforms,  such  as  an  effort  to  institute  habeas  corpus 
in  1946,  often  failed;  attempts  by  United  States  advisers  to  prevent 
South  Korean  police  from  using  torture,  especially  in  political  cases, 


243 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

also  were  unsuccessful.  Under  Syngman  Rhee,  South  Korea  con- 
tinued the  prewar  pattern  of  using  law  and  the  police  for  political 
purposes — intimidating  the  judiciary,  arresting  journalists,  and  ap- 
plying extralegal  pressures  against  the  teaching  profession  and  mem- 
bers of  the  new  National  Assembly. 

Under  the  presidencies  of  Park  and  Chun  such  problems  wors- 
ened, and  there  were  increasing  signs  of  tension  between  the  govern- 
ment and  its  supporters,  who  sought  to  ignore  or  minimize  such 
rights,  and  many  South  Koreans,  including  some  even  within 
the  government,  who  believed  that  civil,  legal,  and  political  rights 
should  be  honored.  This  tension  was  evident  in  the  affirmations 
of  rights  found  in  most  of  South  Korea's  postwar  constitutions  and 
especially  in  the  government's  need  for  increasingly  stringent  mea- 
sures to  control  a  restive  judiciary  under  theyusin  constitution.  The 
forced  resignations  of  judges  and  the  resort  to  military  tribunals 
in  some  political  trials  were  rationalized  on  national  security 
grounds,  but  only  served  to  show  that  by  the  mid-1970s  the  gov- 
ernment was,  on  such  matters,  no  longer  able  to  command  the 
respect  and  cooperation  of  a  significant  part  of  the  country's  legal 
profession. 

The  Chun  government  modified  some  of  the  worst  features  of 
the yusin  constitution  by  removing  the  admissibility  of  confessions 
as  evidence,  for  example,  but  continued  most  of  the  abusive  police 
and  judicial  practices  of  the  Park  period  with  little  change.  Penal 
sentences  for  people  found  guilty  of  offenses  under  certain  politi- 
cally relevant  laws — the  National  Security  Act  and  the  Act  Con- 
cerning Assembly  and  Demonstration,  for  example — actually  were 
harsher  under  Chun  than  under  the  preceding  yusin  system. 

In  addition  to  the  growing  disaffection  of  the  legal  profession 
in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  South  Korea's  modernization  had  gener- 
ated two  social  trends — rapid  urbanization  and  dramatic  increases 
in  literacy  and  education  levels — that  were  essential  to  industriali- 
zation, irreversible,  and  highly  corrosive  of  traditional  authoritar- 
ian practices.  Public  outrage  against  the  police  torture  and  killing 
of  a  student  during  an  interrogation  in  early  1987  helped  to  fuel 
the  growing  political  crisis  that  culminated  in  the  tulmultuous  events 
in  June. 

The  agreement  in  late  1989  between  opposition  and  government 
parties  concerning  the  legacy  of  the  Fifth  Republic  left  unresolved 
the  question  of  what  the  press  and  many  politicians  referred  to  as 
revision  of  akpop  (evil  laws).  These  were  laws  long  used  in  South 
Korea  to  restrict  and  punish  nonviolent  political  activity.  The  abo- 
lition in  1988  of  one  such  law,  the  Basic  Press  Act  of  December 
1980,  had  important  and  immediate  effects  on  freedom  of  the  press. 


244 


Government  and  Politics 


Other  laws  remained  on  the  statute  books  and  were  increasingly 
used  in  1989  as  the  Roh  administration  reached  the  apparent  limits 
of  its  willingness  to  tolerate  dissent.  Despite  Roh's  initial  reputa- 
tion for  moderation,  police  records  reported  in  the  press  show  that 
by  late  1989  the  Roh  government  had  more  than  doubled  the  Chun 
administration's  rate  of  arrests  for  political  offenses. 

As  measured  in  numbers  of  persons  under  investigation,  stand- 
ing trial,  or  serving  sentences,  the  Act  Concerning  Assembly  and 
Demonstration  continued  under  Roh,  as  under  the  Fifth  Repub- 
lic, to  be  the  law  most  frequently  used  to  restrict  and  control  non- 
violent political  expression.  The  law  gave  police  chiefs,  of  whom 
there  were  twenty-four  in  Seoul  alone,  the  authority  to  deny  per- 
mission, without  appeal,  for  any  proposed  demonstration.  Police 
also  had  wide  discretion  over  treatment  of  participants  in  illegal 
demonstrations,  determining  whether  a  given  participant  was  to 
be  charged  with  sponsoring  an  illegal  demonstration,  which  car- 
ried the  threat  of  a  seven-year  prison  term,  or  with  varying  degrees 
of  participation,  which  could  be  punished  as  a  misdemeanor  or  even 
with  a  simple  warning.  Police  had  on  occasion  taken  actions  un- 
der the  law  to  prevent  persons  from  attending  meetings  that  the 
police  believed  were  "likely  to  breed  social  unrest." 

The  National  Security  Act,  as  amended  in  1980,  restricted  "anti- 
state  activities"  that  endangered  "the  state  or  the  lives  and  free- 
dom of  the  citizenry. ' '  However,  Seoul  used  the  law  not  only  against 
espionage  or  sabotage,  but  also  to  control  and  punish  domestic  dis- 
sent, such  as  the  publication  of  unorthodox  political  commentary, 
art,  or  literature,  on  the  grounds  that  such  expressions  benefited 
an  "antistate  organization."  In  divided  Korea,  almost  any  act  of 
opposition  to  the  South  Korean  government  could  be  and  has  been 
characterized  as  benefiting  North  Korea.  Arrests  under  the  law  have 
been  made  for  a  wide  variety  of  actions,  including  the  sale  of  cas- 
sette tapes  containing  antigovernment  songs;  the  sale,  possession, 
or  reading  of  books  and  other  publications  on  the  government's 
banned  list;  or  chanting  anti- American  slogans  at  a  student  rally. 
Ordinary  procedural  protections  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Proce- 
dure were  not  provided  for  defendants  for  offenses  under  this  law. 
Any  liaison  with  antistate  organizations  was  also  punishable  un- 
der the  law,  although  in  the  late  1980s  there  was  considerable  de- 
bate concerning  the  government's  selectivity  in  allowing  some 
politicians  and  businessmen  to  travel  to  North  Korea  or  meet  with 
North  Korean  officials  while  severely  punishing  critics  of  the  govern- 
ment who  did  the  same  thing.  There  was  a  surge  in  prosecutions 
for  various  offenses  under  the  National  Security  Act  in  1989,  despite 
continuing  talk  of  amending  the  law  to  facilitate  broader  contacts 


245 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

with  the  north.  In  early  1990,  as  the  third  year  of  Roh's  adminis- 
tration began  and  as  the  government  mulled  over  plans  to  sign 
several  international  agreements  concerning  human  rights,  it  was 
still  unclear  whether  or  when  the  promise  of  Roh's  1988  inaugural 
speech,  that  "the  day  when  freedoms  and  human  rights  could  be 
slighted  in  the  name  of  economic  growth  and  national  security  has 
ended,"  would  be  redeemed. 

The  Media 

Modern  Korean  journalism  began  after  the  opening  of  Korea 
in  1876.  The  Korean  press  had  a  strong  reformist  and  nationalis- 
tic flavor  from  the  beginning  but  faced  efforts  at  political  control 
or  outright  censorship  during  most  of  the  twentieth  century.  Many 
Korean  journalists  established  a  tradition  of  remaining  indepen- 
dent. They  were  often  critical  of  the  government,  zealously  pro- 
testing any  attempts  at  press  censorship.  At  annexation  in  1910, 
the  Japanese  governor  general  assumed  direct  control  of  the  press 
along  with  other  public  institutions.  Following  the  March  First 
Movement  in  1919,  Japanese  authorities  loosened  their  overt  con- 
trol over  cultural  activities  and  permitted  several  Korean 
newspapers  to  function  while  maintaining  some  behind-the-scenes 
direction  over  politically  sensitive  topics.  During  the  1920s,  Korean 
vernacular  newspapers,  such  as  Tonga  ilbo  (East  Asia  Daily),  and 
intellectual  journals,  such  as  Kaebyok  (Creation),  conducted  run- 
ning skirmishes  with  Japanese  censors.  Japanese  authorities  pro- 
hibited sales  of  individual  issues  on  hundreds  of  occasions  between 
1926  and  1932.  Japan's  war  mobilization  in  the  ensuing  years  ended 
any  semblance  of  autonomy  for  the  Korean  press;  all  Korean- 
language  publications  were  outiawed  in  1941. 

Following  the  period  of  the  United  States  Army  Military  Govern- 
ment in  Korea  (1945-48),  which  saw  a  burgeoning  of  newspapers 
and  periodicals  of  every  description  as  well  as  occasional  censor- 
ship of  the  media,  almost  all  subsequent  South  Korean  govern- 
ments have  at  times  attempted  to  control  the  media.  Syngman 
Rhee's  government  continued  the  military  government's  Ordinance 
Number  Eighty-Eight,  which  outlawed  leftist  newspapers.  Rhee 
also  closed  moderate  newspapers  and  arrested  reporters  and  pub- 
lishers on  numerous  occasions  between  1948  and  1960.  On  taking 
power  in  1961,  Park  Chung  Hee's  Supreme  Council  for  National 
Reconstruction  closed  all  but  fifteen  of  Seoul's  sixty-four  daily 
newspapers  and  refused  to  register  a  comparable  percentage  of  the 
country's  news  services,  weeklies,  and  monthly  publications  while 
using  its  own  radio  and  news  agencies  to  promote  its  official  line. 
The  Park  government  also  used  the  Press  Ethics  Commission  Law 


246 


Government  and  Politics 


of  1964  and,  after  1972,  emergency  decrees  that  penalized  criti- 
cism of  the  government  to  keep  the  media  in  line.  In  1974  the 
government  ordered  a  number  of  journalists  fired  and  used  the 
KCIA  to  force  Tonga  ilbo  to  stop  its  reporting  on  popular  opposi- 
tion to  the  Park  government  by  intimidating  the  paper's  advertisers. 

During  the  Park  and  Chun  years,  the  government  exercised 
considerable  control  and  surveillance  over  the  media  through  the 
comprehensive  National  Security  Act.  In  late  1980,  the  Chun  gov- 
ernment established  more  thorough  control  of  the  news  media  than 
had  existed  in  South  Korea  since  the  Korean  War.  Independent 
news  agencies  were  absorbed  into  a  single  state-run  agency,  numer- 
ous provincial  newspapers  were  closed,  central  newspapers  were 
forbidden  to  station  correspondents  in  provincial  cities,  the  Chris- 
tian Broadcasting  System  network  was  forbidden  to  provide  news 
coverage,  and  two  independent  broadcasting  companies  were  ab- 
sorbed into  the  state-run  Korean  Broadcasting  System  (KBS).  In 
addition,  the  Defense  Security  Command,  then  commanded  by 
Roh  Tae  Woo,  and  the  Ministry  of  Culture  and  Information  or- 
dered hundreds  of  South  Korean  journalists  fired  and  banned  from 
newspaper  writing  or  editing. 

The  Basic  Press  Act  of  December  1980  was  the  legal  capstone 
of  Chun's  system  of  media  control  and  provided  for  censorship  and 
control  of  newspapers,  periodicals,  and  broadcast  media.  It  also 
set  the  professional  qualifications  for  journalists.  Media  censorship 
was  coordinated  with  intelligence  officials,  representatives  of  vari- 
ous government  agencies,  and  the  presidential  staff  by  the  Office 
of  Public  Information  Policy  within  the  Ministry  of  Culture  and 
Information  using  daily  "reporting  guidelines"  (podo  chich'im)  sent 
to  newspaper  editors.  The  guidelines  dealt  exhaustively  with  ques- 
tions of  emphasis,  topics  to  be  covered  or  avoided,  the  use  of  govern- 
ment press  releases,  and  even  the  size  of  headlines.  Enforcement 
methods  ranged  from  telephone  calls  to  editors  to  more  serious  forms 
of  intimidation,  including  interrogations  and  beatings  by  police. 
One  former  Ministry  of  Culture  and  Information  official  told  a 
National  Assembly  hearing  in  1988  that  compliance  during  his  ten- 
ure from  1980  to  1982  reached  about  70  percent. 

By  the  mid-1980s,  censorship  of  print  and  broadcast  media  had 
become  one  of  the  most  widely  and  publicly  criticized  practices  of 
the  Chun  government.  Even  the  government-controlled  Yonhap 
News  Agency  noted  in  1989  that  "TV  companies,  scarcely  worse 
than  other  media,  were  the  main  target  of  bitter  public  criticism 
for  their  distorted  reporting  for  the  government  in  the  early  1980s. " 
Editorials  called  for  abolition  of  the  Basic  Press  Act  and  related 
practices,  a  bill  was  unsuccessfully  introduced  in  the  National 


247 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

Assembly  to  the  same  end,  and  a  public  campaign  to  withhold  com- 
pulsory viewers'  fees  in  protest  against  censorship  by  the  KBS  net- 
work received  widespread  press  attention.  By  the  summer  of  1986, 
even  the  ruling  party  was  responding  to  public  opinion. 

The  political  liberalization  of  the  late  1980s  brought  a  loosening 
of  press  restraints  and  a  new  generation  of  journalists  more  will- 
ing to  investigate  sensitive  subjects,  such  as  the  May  1980  Kwangju 
incident.  Roh's  eight-point  declaration  of  June  29,  1987,  provid- 
ed for  "a  free  press,  including  allowing  newspapers  to  base  cor- 
respondents in  provincial  cities  and  withdrawing  security  officials 
from  newspaper  offices."  The  South  Korean  media  began  a  rapid 
expansion.  Seoul  papers  expanded  their  coverage  and  resumed  the 
practice  of  stationing  correspondents  in  provincial  cities.  Although 
temporarily  still  under  the  management  of  a  former  Blue  House 
press  spokesman,  the  MBC  television  network,  a  commercial  net- 
work that  had  been  under  control  of  the  state-managed  KBS  since 
1980,  resumed  independent  broadcasting.  The  number  of  radio 
broadcast  stations  grew  from  74  in  1985  to  1 1 1  (including  both  AM 
and  FM  stations)  by  late  1988  and  to  125  by  late  1989.  The  num- 
ber of  periodicals  rose  as  the  government  removed  restrictions  on 
the  publishing  industry  (see  Transportation  and  Telecommunica- 
tions, ch.  3;  table  15,  Appendix). 

There  also  were  qualitative  changes  in  the  South  Korean  me- 
dia. The  Christian  Broadcasting  System,  a  radio  network,  again 
began  to  broadcast  news  as  well  as  religious  programming  in  1987. 
In  the  same  year,  the  government  partially  lifted  a  long-standing 
ban  on  the  works  of  North  Korean  artists  and  musicians,  many 
of  whom  were  of  South  Korean  origin.  A  newspaper  run  by  dissi- 
dent journalists  began  publication  in  1988.  A  number  of  other  new 
dailies  also  appeared  in  1988.  Many  of  the  new  weekly  and  monthly 
periodicals  bypassed  the  higher  profits  of  the  traditional  general 
circulation  magazines  to  provide  careful  analyses  of  political,  eco- 
nomic, and  national  security  affairs  to  smaller,  specialized  au- 
diences. Observers  noted  a  dramatic  increase  in  press  coverage  of 
previously  taboo  subjects  such  as  political-military  relations,  fac- 
tions within  the  military,  the  role  of  security  agencies  in  politics, 
and  the  activities  of  dissident  organizations.  Opinion  polls  dealing 
with  these  and  other  sensitive  issues  also  began  to  appear  with  in- 
creasing regularity.  Journalists  at  several  of  the  Seoul  dailies  organ- 
ized trade  unions  in  late  1987  and  early  1988  and  began  to  press 
for  editorial  autonomy  and  a  greater  role  in  newspaper  manage- 
ment. 

In  1989  South  Korea's  four  largest  dailies,  Hanguk  ilbo,  Chun- 
gang  ilbo,  Choson  ilbo,  and  Tonga  ilbo,  had  a  combined  circulation  of 


248 


Government  and  Politics 


more  than  6.5  million  readers.  The  antiestablishment  Hangydre  sim- 
mun  (One  Nation  News)  had  450,000  readers — less  than  the  major 
dailies  or  smaller  papers  like  Kyonghyang  simmun  or  Soul  simmun  but 
larger  than  four  more  specialized  economic  dailies.  All  the  major 
dailies  were  privately  owned,  except  for  the  government-controlled 
Hanguk  ilbo.  Several  other  daily  publications  had  specialized  reader- 
ships among  sport  fans  and  youth.  Two  English-language  news- 
papers, the  government- subsidized  Korea  Herald  and  the  Korea  Times, 
which  was  affiliated  with  the  independent  Soul  simmun,  were  widely 
read  by  foreign  embassies  and  businesses.  A  Chinese-language  daily 
served  South  Korea's  small  Chinese  population  (see  Population, 
ch.  2). 

The  Yonhap  News  Agency  provided  domestic  and  foreign  news 
to  government  agencies,  newspapers,  and  broadcasters.  Yonhap 
also  provided  news  on  South  Korean  developments  in  English  by 
computerized  transmission  via  the  Asia-Pacific  News  Network.  Ad- 
ditional links  with  world  media  were  facilitated  by  four  satellite 
link  stations.  The  International  Broadcast  Center  established  in 
June  1988  served  some  10,000  broadcasters  for  the  1988  Seoul 
Olympics.  The  government's  KBS  radio  network  broadcast  over- 
seas in  twelve  languages.  Two  private  radio  networks,  the  Asia 
Broadcasting  Company  and  Far  East  Broadcasting  Company, 
served  a  wide  regional  audience  that  included  the  Soviet  Far  East, 
China,  and  Japan. 

The  South  Korean  government  also  supported  Naewoe  Press, 
which  dealt  solely  with  North  Korean  affairs.  Originally  a  propagan- 
da vehicle  that  followed  the  government  line  on  unification  policy 
issues,  Naewoe  Press  became  increasingly  objective  and  moderate 
in  tone  in  the  mid-1980s  in  interpreting  political,  social,  and  eco- 
nomic developments  in  North  Korea.  Vantage  Point,  an  English- 
language  publication  of  Naewoe  Press,  provided  in-depth  studies 
of  North  Korean  social,  economic,  and  political  developments. 

Except  for  two  newspapers  (one  in  Korean  and  one  in  English) 
that  the  government  owned  or  controlled  and  the  state  television 
network,  ownership  of  the  media  was  for  the  most  part  distinct  from 
political  or  economic  power.  One  exception  was  the  conservative 
daily,  Chungang  ilbo.  Under  the  close  oversight  of  its  owner,  the 
late  Samsung  Group  founder  and  multimillionaire  Yi  Pyong-ch'ol, 
the  paper  and  its  affiliated  TBC  television  network  generally  sup- 
ported the  Park  government  during  the  1970s.  Its  relations  with 
the  government  became  strained  after  1980,  however,  when  Chun 
Doo  Hwan  forced  TBC  to  merge  with  KBS.  A  journalists'  strike 
at  Chungang  ilbo  in  1989,  in  one  of  many  similar  incidents  at  the 


249 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

major  South  Korean  newspapers,  won  even  greater  management 
and  editorial  independence. 

Most  of  South  Korea's  major  newspapers  derived  their  financial 
support  from  advertising  and  from  their  affiliation  with  major  pub- 
lishing houses.  The  Tonga  Press,  for  example,  published  not  only 
the  prestigious  daily  Tonga  ilbo,  but  also  a  variety  of  other  periodi- 
cals, including  a  newspaper  for  children,  the  general  circulation 
monthly  Sin  tonga  (New  East  Asia),  a  women's  magazine,  and  spe- 
cialized reference  books  and  magazines  for  students.  Throughout  the 
postwar  period,  Tonga  ilbo  has  been  noted  for  its  opposition  sympathies. 

South  Korea's  principal  antiestablishment  newspaper,  Hangyore 
simmun,  began  publication  in  May  1988.  It  was  founded  by  dissident 
journalists  who  were  purged  by  the  government  in  the  early  1970s 
or  in  1980;  many  of  the  paper's  reporters  and  editorial  staff  left  posi- 
tions on  mainstream  newspapers  to  join  the  new  venture.  The  struc- 
ture and  approach  of  the  paper  reflected  the  founders'  view  that  in 
the  past  the  South  Korean  news  media  had  been  too  easily  co-opted 
by  the  government.  The  paper  had  a  human  rights  department  as 
well  as  a  mass  media  department  to  keep  an  eye  on  the  government's 
press  policy  and  to  critique  the  ideological  and  political  biases  of 
other  newspapers.  The  paper's  nationalism  and  interest  in  national 
reunification  were  symbolically  represented  in  the  logo,  which  depict- 
ed Lake  Ch'onji  at  the  peak  of  Mount  Paektu  in  North  Korea;  in 
the  exclusive  use  of  the  Korean  alphabet;  and  by  the  type  font  in 
which  the  paper's  name  was  printed — the  font  dated  from  a  famous 
Korean  publication  of  the  eighteenth  century.  The  paper  was  printed 
horizontally,  rather  than  vertically  like  other  Seoul  dailies.  In  other 
innovations,  the  Hangyore  simmun  relied  on  sales  revenues,  private 
contributions,  and  the  sale  of  stock,  rather  than  on  advertising  from 
major  corporations,  in  line  with  its  claim  to  be  "the  first  newspaper 
in  the  world  truly  independent  of  political  power  and  large  capi- 
tal."  The  newspaper  came  under  increasing  government  pressure 
in  1989  (see  Political  Dynamics,  this  ch.). 

South  Korea  also  had  extensive  and  well-developed  visual  me- 
dia. The  first  Korean  film  was  produced  in  1919,  and  cinemas  sub- 
sequently were  built  in  the  larger  cities.  The  result  of  the  spread 
of  television  sets  and  radios  was  the  dissemination  of  a  homogenized 
popular  culture  and  the  impingement  of  urban  values  on  rural  com- 
munities. 

Foreign  Policy 
Organization  and  Operation 

The  Constitution  of  the  Sixth  Republic  vests  the  conduct  of  foreign 


250 


Government  and  Politics 


affairs  in  the  presidency  and  the  State  Council,  subject  to  the  ap- 
proval of  the  National  Assembly.  The  president  and  the  State  Coun- 
cil, through  the  prime  minister  and  the  minister  of  foreign  affairs, 
make  periodic  reports  on  foreign  relations  to  the  legislature.  The 
president  receives  or  dispatches  envoys  without  legislative  confir- 
mation; treaties,  however,  must  receive  legislative  consent.  Decla- 
rations of  war,  the  dispatch  of  troops  overseas,  and  the  stationing 
of  foreign  troops  within  the  national  borders  also  are  subject  to  legis- 
lative approval  (Article  60  of  the  Constitution).  The  National  As- 
sembly has  a  standing  Foreign  Affairs  Committee  that  reports  its 
deliberations  to  plenary  sessions  of  the  assembly.  The  assembly  may 
also  establish  ad  hoc  committees  to  consider  questions  of  special 
importance  to  the  state. 

Constitutionally,  major  foreign  policy  objectives  are  established 
by  the  president.  The  chief  foreign  policy  advisers  in  the  State  Coun- 
cil are  the  prime  minister,  who  heads  the  cabinet,  and  the  minister 
of  foreign  affairs.  From  time  to  time,  these  officials  may  be  ques- 
tioned by  the  National  Assembly;  the  Assembly  may  pass  a  recom- 
mendation for  the  removal  from  office  of  the  prime  minister  or  a 
State  Council  member  (Article  63).  The  president  is  assisted  by 
the  National  Security  Council  in  the  formulation  and  execution 
of  foreign,  military,  and  domestic  policies  related  to  national  security 
prior  to  their  deliberation  by  the  State  Council  (Article  91).  The 
Agency  for  National  Security  Planning,  its  mission  akin  to  that 
of  a  combined  United  States  Central  Intelligence  Agency  and  Fed- 
eral Bureau  of  Investigation,  has  direct  access  to  the  president  and 
operates  at  his  personal  direction  in  the  overall  conduct  of  foreign 
policy  (see  The  Agency  for  National  Security  Planning,  ch.  5). 

Diplomatic  missions  abroad  conduct  foreign  policy.  The  Ministry 
of  Foreign  Affairs  was  established  with  functional  and  area  divi- 
sions. The  foreign  ministry  staff  consists  of  civil  service  members 
and  a  highly  professionalized  career  foreign  service  corps,  select- 
ed on  the  basis  of  at  least  a  college  education  and  performance  in 
a  highly  competitive  examination  supervised  by  the  Ministry  of 
Government  Administration.  Regarded  as  prestigious  social  posi- 
tions, diplomatic  posts  attract  ambitious  and  bright  individuals  who 
undergo  an  intensive  training  program  conducted  by  the  Foreign 
Affairs  Research  Institute.  The  institute  in  the  late  1980s  had  a 
very  rigorous  curriculum  in  international  diplomacy,  specialized 
area  training,  and  intensive  language  training. 

Basic  Goals  and  Accomplishments 

The  external  posture  of  South  Korea  in  general,  and  toward 
North  Korea  in  particular,  began  a  new  chapter  in  the  1980s.  While 


251 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

retaining  its  previous  goal — enhancing  political  legitimacy,  mili- 
tary security,  and  economic  development  by  maintaining  close  ties 
with  the  West — South  Korea  greatly  expanded  its  diplomatic 
horizons  by  launching  its  ambitious  pukpang  chongch  'aek  (see  Glos- 
sary), northern  policy,  or  Nordpolitik.  Nordpolitik  was  Seoul's  ver- 
sion of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany's  (West  Germany) 
Ostpolitik  of  the  early  1970s.  Although  the  policy's  origins  can  be 
traced  back  to  1973  under  Park,  it  was  greatly  invigorated  by  Roh. 

Seoul's  Nordpolitik  was  designed  for  a  number  of  rather  ambi- 
tious but  initially  ill-defined  objectives.  Seoul's  basic  dilemma  in 
its  Nordpolitik  appeared  to  be  how  to  reconcile  its  traditional  ties 
with  the  West  with  its  new  opportunities  in  the  East.  First, 
policymakers  felt  that  their  economic  and  military  reliance  on  the 
West  was  excessive,  mendicant,  and  too  lengthy.  Seoul  sought  to 
correct  this  situation  by  establishing  its  own  self-reliant  global 
posture.  This  desire  to  be  less  dependent  became  particularly  acute 
as  Seoul's  Western  allies  greatly  improved  relations  with  Eastern 
Europe,  the  Soviet  Union,  and  China. 

Second,  Nordpolitik  was  designed  to  expand  and  diversify  trade 
relations  on  a  global  scale  to  cope  with  increasing  trade  protec- 
tionism from  the  United  States.  Intentionally  or  not,  the  policy 
aroused  anti- Americanism.  Ironically  enough,  the  rising  anti- 
United  States  feeling  was  accompanied  by  increasing  demands  for 
economic  and  political  democracy,  culminating  in  the  Kwangju 
incident  in  May  1980. 

Finally,  Nordpolitik  involved  the  pursuit  of  wide-ranging  rela- 
tions with  socialist  countries  and  contacts  and  dialogue  with  North 
Korea.  It  had  often  been  observed  that  political  leaders  in  Pyong- 
yang and  Seoul  utilized  their  confrontational  postures  to  sustain 
their  political  legitimacy.  Claiming  that  Pyongyang's  response  had 
been  far  from  satisfactory,  Seoul's  policymakers  solicited  assistance 
and  cooperation  from  Pyongyang's  socialist  allies  to  induce  and 
persuade  P'yongyang  to  become  more  accommodating.  Yet  Seoul's 
success  in  improving  relations  with  P'yongyang' s  socialist  allies  had 
not  resulted  in  substantially  improved  relations  with  P'yongyang 
by  1990.  In  fact,  for  the  short  term,  Seoul  even  might  have  less- 
ened its  chances  for  improved  relations  with  P'yongyang  by  hav- 
ing improved  its  relations  with  North  Korea's  socialist  allies  and 
by  raising  the  question  of  whether  Nordpolitik  was  primarily 
designed  to  confront  and  compete  with  P'yongyang.  Thus  far, 
Nordpolitik  clearly  demonstrated  the  limited  power  of  P'yongyang' s 
socialist  allies,  particularly  Moscow  and  Beijing,  vis-a-vis  the  ex- 
tremely self-reliant  North  Korea.  In  reality,  Seoul  may  have  grossly 
underestimated  Pyongyang's  firmly  established  independence.

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

On  the  whole,  however,  Nordpolitik  was  successful,  and  Seoul's 
accomplishments  could  be  readily  observed  in  sports,  trade,  and 
diplomacy.  The  1988  Seoul  Olympics  was  a  major  catalyst  for  Nord- 
politik. It  was  the  first  Olympic  Games  in  twelve  years  not  marred 
by  a  bloc-level  boycott  and  had  the  highest  participation  ever —  1 59 
nations  and  more  than  9,000  athletes.  Seoul  gained  new  global 
recognition  and  visibility  as  more  than  3  billion  people  around  the 
world  watched  the  games  being  televised  live. 

Had  it  not  been  for  the  North  Korean  bombing  of  KAL  858  over 
the  Andaman  Sea  in  November  1987,  Seoul  might  have  been  more 
willing  to  reach  out  to  P'yongyang.  While  the  much-feared  and 
predicted  North  Korean  misbehavior  over  South  Korea's  staging 
of  the  Olympics  did  not  materialize,  Seoul  probably  was  relieVed 
by  Pyongyang's  absence  from  the  games. 

Seoul's  international  trade  record  has  been  impressive  (see  For- 
eign Economic  Relations,  ch.  3).  While  encountering,  along  with 
other  newly  industrialized  nations,  mounting  trade  friction  with 
the  United  States  and  other  major  markets,  Seoul  emerged  in  the 
late  1980s  as  the  world's  tenth-largest  trading  nation.  Economic 
reforms  and  the  open-door  policies  of  socialist  countries,  coupled 
with  their  recognition  of  Seoul's  economic  growth,  pushed  economic 
trade  and  cooperation  between  South  Korea  and  socialist  coun- 
tries into  full  swing. 

Perhaps  Seoul's  most  impressive  success  was  in  diplomacy.  Liter- 
ally implementing  the  1988  Olympics  slogan,  "From  Seoul  to  the 
World,  and  from  the  World  to  Seoul,"  by  the  beginning  of  1990 
South  Korea  had  established  diplomatic  relations  with  133  coun- 
tries and  had  138  diplomatic  missions,  including  representative 
offices  and  a  consulate  department  in  Moscow.  Conversely,  North 
Korea  had  diplomatic  relations  with  102  countries  and  85  overseas 
missions.  An  impressive  number  of  young  South  Korean  diplo- 
mats were  trained  in  the  West  and  actively  implemented  Nord- 
politik. These  diplomats  were  also  supported  by  the  aggressive 
worldwide  market  diversification  programs  of  South  Korea's  big 
business  establishments,  the  chaebol,  and  by  an  increasingly  large 
number  of  overseas  South  Koreans,  many  of  whom  become 
salespersons  of  South  Korean  products  (see  The  Origins  and  De- 
velopment of  Chaebol,  ch.  3). 

After  Roh's  inauguration  in  February  1988,  Nordpolitik  was  par- 
ticularly invigorated.  In  a  July  7,  1988,  statement  primarily  aimed 
at  insuring  the  success  of  the  Olympics,  Roh  unveiled  a  six-point 
plan  to  ease  forty  years  of  bitter  confrontation  between  Seoul  and 
P'yongyang  and  to  clear  the  way  for  peaceful  unification  of  the 
divided  peninsula.  In  the  afterglow  of  the  Olympics,  Roh  made 


254 


Government  and  Politics 


his  diplomatic  debut  as  the  first  South  Korean  president  to  address 
the  United  Nations  (UN)  General  Assembly,  on  October  18,  1988. 
Roh's  speech  called  for  a  six-nation  consultative  conference  to  dis- 
cuss a  broad  range  of  issues  concerning  peace,  stability,  progress, 
and  prosperity  in  Northeast  Asia.  Pledging  unilaterally  never  to 
use  force  first  against  North  Korea,  Roh  proposed  to  replace  the 
existing  1953  armistice  agreement  with  a  peace  treaty. 

Relations  with  the  United  States 

South  Korea's  relations  with  the  United  States  have  been  most 
extensive  and  intense  since  1948.  This  relation  was  perhaps  inevita- 
ble because  South  Korea  was  primarily  established  by  the  United 
States  and  was  saved  from  a  total  collapse  in  the  course  of  the 
Korean  War  (1950-53)  by  the  United  States-initiated,  United 
Nations- sponsored  rescue  operation.  During  the  subsequent  four 
decades,  however,  Seoul  came  of  age  economically,  politically,  and 
even  militarily  and  was  no  longer  as  economically  or  militarily  de- 
pendent on  the  United  States.  Instead,  by  the  1990s  it  was  seeking 
to  establish  a  partnership  for  progress.  The  Seoul- Washington  rela- 
tionship in  this  transition  was  increasingly  subject  to  severe  strains. 

Trade  had  become  a  serious  source  of  friction  between  the  two 
countries.  In  1989  the  United  States  was  South  Korea's  largest  and 
most  important  trading  partner,  and  South  Korea  was  the  seventh- 
largest  market  for  United  States  goods  and  the  second-largest  market 
for  its  agricultural  products.  Friction,  however,  had  been  caused 
in  the  late  1980s  by  South  Korea's  trade  surplus.  Correcting  and 
eliminating  this  trade  imbalance  became  the  center  of  economic 
controversy  between  Seoul  and  Washington.  Although  Seoul  gave 
in  to  Washington's  demands  to  avoid  being  designated  as  a  "pri- 
ority foreign  country"  (PFC)  under  the  United  States  "Super  301 " 
provisions  of  the  Omnibus  Trade  and  Competitiveness  Act  of  1988, 
economic  policymakers  in  Seoul  greatiy  resented  this  unilateral  eco- 
nomic threat.  They  also  feared  that  the  PFC  designation  would 
fuel  anti- Americanism  throughout  South  Korea. 

Security  was  another  source  of  strain.  Some  policymakers  in 
Seoul  and  Washington  maintained  that  United  States  forces  should 
remain  in  South  Korea  as  long  as  Seoul  wanted  and  needed  them. 
Not  only  did  94  percent  of  South  Koreans  support  the  presence 
of  United  States  forces,  but  even  the  vocal  opposition  parties  fa- 
vored a  continued  United  States  military  presence  in  South  Korea. 
Stability  in  the  peninsula,  they  argued,  had  been  maintained  be- 
cause strong  Seoul-Washington  military  cooperation  had  deterred 
further  aggression. 


255 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


Other  policymakers,  however,  felt  that  United  States  troops 
should  gradually  be  leaving  South  Korea.  They  argued  that  South 
Korea  in  the  late  1980s  was  more  economically,  militarily,  and  po- 
litically capable  of  coping  with  North  Korea.  Moreover,  they  doubt- 
ed that  P'yongyang  could  contemplate  another  military  action, 
given  its  acrimonious  relationships  with  Moscow  and  Beijing.  In 
Washington,  meanwhile,  an  increasing  number  of  United  States 
policymakers  advocated  gradual  troop  withdrawal  for  budgetary 
reasons.  The  consultations  on  restructuring  the  Washington- Seoul 
security  relationship  held  during  Secretary  of  Defense  Richard  B . 
Cheney's  February  1990  visit  to  South  Korea  marked  the  begin- 
ning of  the  change  in  status  of  United  States  forces — from  a  lead- 
ing to  a  supporting  role  in  South  Korea's  defense.  In  addition,  Seoul 
was  asked  to  increase  substantially  its  contribution  to  defense  costs. 
Although  the  precise  amount  of  savings  would  be  difficult  to  mea- 
sure, the  United  States  would  likely  save  at  least  US$2  billion  to 
US$3  billion  annually  if  defense  costs  were  restructured  as  the  United 
States  wished.  Furthermore,  disengagement  would  avoid  the  potential 
for  American  entanglement  in  complicated  internal  South  Korean 
politics.  In  short,  it  was  suggested  that  it  was  time  for  Seoul  to  be 
treated  as  an  independent  entity  responsible  for  its  own  security. 

Politics  also  strained  relations  between  Seoul  and  Washington. 
An  increasingly  sensitive  South  Korean  nationalism  was  faced  with 
what  Seoul  viewed  as  a  hardened  Washington.  The  United  States 
role  in  the  May  1980  Kwangju  uprising  was  the  single  most  press- 
ing South  Korean  political  issue  of  the  1980s.  Even  after  a  decade, 
Kwangju  citizens  and  other  Koreans  still  blamed  the  United  States 
for  its  perceived  involvement  in  the  bloody  uprising. 

Washington's  policymakers  applauded  Nordpolitik  as  a  neces- 
sary adjustment  of  the  relationship  between  Seoul  and  Moscow. 
However,  the  South  Korean  press  contributed  to  a  distorted  zero- 
sum  notion  of  the  situation,  suggesting  that  improving  ties  with 
the  Soviet  Union  would  cause  strains  in  the  relationship  with  the 
United  States.  In  his  February  1989  speech  to  the  South  Korean 
National  Assembly,  President  George  Bush  defined  continuity  and 
change  as  the  guideposts  in  Seoul- Washington  relations. 

Relations  with  the  Soviet  Union 

Seoul-Moscow  relations  entered  a  new  era  in  the  1980s.  In  many 
ways,  Roh's  Nordpolitik  and  Mikhail  Gorbachev's  "New  Think- 
ing" had  something  in  common — they  were  attempts  to  reverse 
their  nations'  recent  histories.  Their  efforts,  while  supported  by 
popular  longings,  still  confronted  serious  resistance  from  conser- 
vative and  powerful  bureaucracies.  In  a  fundamental  sense,  the 


256 


Government  and  Politics 


Soviet  economic  crisis  appeared  responsible  for  Moscow's  improved 
relations  with  Seoul.  Politically,  Gorbachev  had  signaled  Soviet 
interest  in  improving  relations  with  all  countries  in  the  Asia-Pacific 
region  irrespective  of  sociopolitical  system,  including  South  Korea, 
as  was  clearly  spelled  out  in  his  July  1986  Vladivostok  and  August 
1988  Krasnoyarsk  speeches. 

Improved  Seoul-Moscow  relations  appear  to  have  been  careful- 
ly and  systematically  planned  in  three  related  stages:  sports,  trade, 
and  political  relations.  The  Seoul  Olympics  was  a  major  catalyst. 
The  Soviets  were  eager  to  participate  in  the  games,  if  only  for  the 
sake  of  the  athletic  competition.  Seoul's  most  honored  guests  were 
from  the  Soviet  Union.  Moscow  sent  more  than  6,000  Soviets  to 
South  Korea.  Soviet  tourist  ships  came  to  Pusan  and  Inch 'on,  and 
Aeroflot  planes  landed  in  Seoul.  And  when  the  Soviet  team  head- 
ed for  home,  it  also  took  along  thirty- six  South  Korean  television 
sets,  seven  minibuses,  four  large  buses,  four  cars,  and  one  copy 
machine — all  gifts  from  Daewoo. 

Economically,  Seoul  and  Moscow  were  natural  partners.  South 
Korea  had  been  seeking  to  trade  with  the  Soviet  Union  even  be- 
fore Gorbachev  came  to  power.  Gorbachev  desired  foreign  capital 
and  high  technology,  as  well  as  Seoul's  help  in  alleviating  the  Soviet 
economic  crisis  through  direct  investment,  joint  ventures,  and  trade. 
Moreover,  with  the  advantage  of  geographic  proximity,  South 
Korea  was  an  ideal  source  of  badly  needed  consumer  goods  and 
managerial  skills.  As  early  as  May  1979,  during  a  visit  to  Helsinki, 
then  South  Korean  minister  of  foreign  affairs  Pak  Tong-jin  signed 
an  agreement  obtaining  Finnish  assistance  in  exporting  South 
Korean  products  to  the  Soviet  Union  and  Eastern  Europe.  Seoul 
has  welcomed  trade  opportunities  with  Moscow  and  considers  the 
Soviet  Union  a  significant  part  of  the  global  market.  Moreover, 
the  natural  resources  Seoul  increasingly  needs — oil,  metals,  tim- 
ber, and  fish — are  abundant  in  the  Soviet  Far  East.  Trade  with 
the  Soviet  Union,  Eastern  Europe,  and  China  would  also  allevi- 
ate South  Korea's  apprehension  over  the  United  States'  increas- 
ing trade  protectionism.  Moreover,  South  Korea's  expanding  trade 
with  Eastern  Europe  and  the  Soviet  Union  initially  was  encouraged 
by  the  United  States,  although  Washington  later  became  increas- 
ingly concerned  over  possible  high-technology  transfers. 

Because  of  the  lack  of  diplomatic  relations,  most  South  Korean- 
Soviet  trade  initially  was  indirect;  Eastern  Europe,  Hong  Kong, 
Japan,  and  Singapore  served  as  intermediaries.  With  an  increas- 
ing volume  of  trade,  Seoul  and  Moscow  began  trading  direcdy,  using 
facilities  near  Vladivostok  and  Pusan.  Several  major  South  Korean 


257 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

businesses,  including  Daewoo,  Sunkyong,  and  Lucky-Goldstar, 
traded  directly  with  the  Soviet  Union  in  1990. 

Based  on  mutual  economic  interests,  the  Korean  Trade  Promo- 
tion Corporation  (KOTRA)  and  the  Soviet  Chamber  of  Commerce 
and  Industry  exchanged  a  trade  memorandum  in  1988  pledging 
mutual  assistance  in  establishing  trade  offices  in  1989.  During  a 
six-day  visit  to  Seoul  in  October  1988,  Vladimir  Golanov,  deputy 
chairman  of  the  Soviet  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  was 
received  by  officials  of  South  Korea's  major  multinationals. 
KOTRA  president  Yi  Sun-gi  signed  the  trade  memorandum  in 
Moscow  in  December  1988.  Seoul's  trade  office  in  Moscow  opened 
in  July  1989;  Moscow's  trade  office  in  Seoul  opened  in  April  1989. 
In  December  1989,  Seoul  invited  Soviet  officials  to  attend  a  trade 
exhibition  where  members  of  the  Soviet  state-run  Tekhsnabeksport 
displayed  impressive  high-technology  items. 

Political  relations  were  developing  gradually.  South  Korea's  new- 
found wealth  and  technological  prowess  had  been  attracting  the 
interest  of  a  growing  number  of  socialist  nations.  In  initiating  Nord- 
politik,  its  chief  architect  Pak  Ch'6r-6n — Roh's  confidential  for- 
eign policy  adviser — was  rumored  to  have  visited  Moscow  to  consult 
with  Soviet  policymakers.  Kim  Young  Sam  visited  Moscow  from 
June  2  to  June  10,  1989,  with  the  apparent  approval  of  the  Roh 
administration.  Selected  from  among  several  other  South  Korean 
politicians  (including  Kim  Dae  Jung,  who  had  reportedly  been  in- 
vited to  Moscow)  to  make  certain  that  the  newly  emerging  Seoul- 
Moscow  relationship  would  proceed  steadily,  Kim  Young  Sam  was 
received  as  a  guest  of  the  Soviet  Institute  of  World  Economy  and 
International  Relations  (IMEMO).  He  participated  in  talks  with 
various  Soviet  officials,  including  the  newly  elected  chairman  of 
the  Supreme  Soviet,  academician  Yevgeni  Primakov.  In  a  joint  state- 
ment, the  Reunification  Democratic  Party  (RDP)  and  IMEMO 
pledged  to  promote  closer  trade  and  cultural  ties  between  the  two 
nations.  While  Kim  Young  Sam  was  in  Moscow,  the  Kremlin 
announced  that  it  would  allow  some  300,000  Soviet-Koreans  who 
had  been  on  the  Soviet  island  of  Sahkalin  since  the  end  of  World 
War  II  to  return  permanently  to  South  Korea — clearly  a  reflec- 
tion of  the  continuing  improvement  in  Seoul-Moscow  relations. 

Moscow  even  arranged  a  Seoul-P'yongyang  meeting.  During 
the  meeting,  which  was  planned  by  IMEMO,  Kim  Young  Sam, 
with  Roh's  prior  approval,  met  with  the  North  Korean  ambassador 
to  the  Soviet  Union,  Kwon  Hui-gyong,  who  reportedly  proposed 
a  regular  exchange  between  the  RDP  and  the  Korean  Workers' 
Party  (KWP),  as  well  as  a  North-South  summit  meeting.  Kim 
also  met  with  Ho  Tarn,  chairman  of  the  Committee  for  Peaceful

Government  and  Politics 


Reunification  of  the  Fatherland  (CPRF),  who  came  to  Moscow 
from  P'yongyang. 

The  progress  in  Seoul-Moscow  relations  was  extraordinary. 
Given  the  complementary  and  parallel  interests  between  Seoul  and 
Moscow,  their  relations  were  likely  to  proceed  even  if  there  were 
temporary  setbacks.  A  highly  experienced  South  Korean  diplomat, 
Kong  No-myong,  was  assigned  to  the  Moscow  consulate;  an  equally 
experienced  Soviet  diplomat  was  posted  to  Seoul.  In  June  1990, 
Roh  held  his  first  summit  with  President  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev 
in  San  Francisco.  Moscow's  "Seoul  Rush"  may  be  regarded  as 
an  effort  to  reconcile  (and  possibly  to  terminate)  its  past  political- 
military  obligations  to  P'yongyang  with  the  new  economic  and  stra- 
tegic opportunities  in  Seoul.  Seoul's  "Moscow  Rush"  had  been 
conceived  primarily  as  a  way  to  utilize  its  growing  economic  power 
for  political  purposes,  particularly  in  its  relations  with  P'yong- 
yang. On  the  other  hand,  if  indeed  the  final  destination  of  Nord- 
politik  was  P'yongyang,  Seoul  had  thus  far  proved  to  be  less 
successful  than  Moscow. 

Relations  with  Japan 

Korea  is  geographically  close,  yet  emotionally  distant  from  Japan. 
Given  the  historical  relationship  between  the  two  countries,  the 
paradoxical  nature  of  their  relation  is  readily  understandable.  Since 
normalizing  relations  in  1965  at  the  urging  of  the  United  States, 
Seoul  and  Tokyo  have  held  annual  foreign  ministerial  conferences. 
The  usual  issues  discussed  have  been  trade,  the  status  of  the  Korean 
minority  population  in  Japan,  the  content  of  textbooks  dealing  with 
the  relationship,  Tokyo's  equidistant  policy  between  P'yongyang 
and  Seoul,  and  the  occasional  problems  (see  Foreign  Policy,  ch.  1). 

At  the  first  of  three  ministerial  conferences  held  in  1987  (in  Seoul, 
New  York,  and  Geneva,  respectively),  the  two  countries'  foreign 
ministers  discussed  pending  issues,  including  Seoul's  trade  deficit 
with  Tokyo.  The  Japanese  minister  of  foreign  affairs  pledged  to  as- 
sist Seoul  in  its  role  as  host  of  the  Olympics.  Seoul  and  Tokyo  signed 
a  bilateral  agreement  on  sea  rescue  and  emergency  cooperation. 

The  1988  foreign  ministerial  conference  was  held  in  Tokyo.  There 
the  two  countries  agreed  to  expand  exchanges  of  youths,  students, 
and  teachers  and  to  establish  the  twenty-first  century  committee 
between  the  two  nations,  as  well  as  a  joint  security  consultative 
committee  for  the  Seoul  Olympics. 

Roh's  Nordpolitik  somewhat  relaxed  Seoul's  vehement  opposi- 
tion to  Tokyo's  approach  to  P'yongyang.  The  Japan  Socialist  Party, 
in  particular,  has  become  active  in  improving  relations  not  only 
between  P'yongyang  and  Tokyo,  but  also  between  itself  and  Seoul. 


259 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

As  the  Japan  Socialist  Party  has  abandoned  its  posture  favoring 
P'yongyang,  Seoul  has  welcomed  the  new  equidistant  policy,  in- 
viting a  former  secretary  general  of  the  Japan  Socialist  Party, 
Ishibashi  Masashi,  to  Seoul  in  October  1988.  Ishibashi's  visit  was 
unusually  productive,  not  only  in  improving  his  party's  image  in 
Seoul,  but  also  in  his  reported  willingness  to  mediate  between  Seoul 
and  P'yongyang.  Although  Tokyo  appeared  willing  to  assist  Seoul 
in  improving  relations  not  only  with  P'yongyang  but  also  with  Bei- 
jing, it  did  not  seem  to  welcome  the  much-improved  Seoul-Moscow 
relationship.  Further,  Seoul-Tokyo  relations  became  somewhat 
strained  when  in  1989  Tokyo  began  steps  to  improve  relations  with 
P'yongyang. 

Relations  with  China 

Nordpolitik  has  been  viewed  as  less  attractive  in  Beijing  than 
in  Moscow.  Beijing's  needs  for  Seoul  in  the  1980s  were  hardly 
matched  with  those  of  Moscow,  particularly  in  economic  terms. 
Still,  because  of  complementary  economic  needs  and  geographic 
proximity,  South  Korea  and  China  began  to  trade  actively.  The 
absence  of  any  official  relations,  however,  made  it  difficult  to  ex- 
pand trade  between  Seoul  and  Beijing  because  South  Korea  could 
not  legally  protect  its  citizens  and  business  interests  in  China. 

Beijing,  in  comparison  with  Moscow,  has  been  politically  closer 
to  P'yongyang,  a  situation  that  has  slowed  political  improvements 
between  Beijing  and  Seoul  despite  the  increasing  volume  of  trade 
between  the  two  countries.  Furthermore,  China  has  attempted  to 
mediate  between  North  Korea  and  the  United  States  and  North 
Korea  and  Japan  and  also  has  initiated  and  promoted  tripartite 
talks  among  P'yongyang,  Seoul,  and  Washington. 

Active  South  Korean-Chinese  people-to-people  contacts  have 
been  encouraged.  Academics,  journalists,  and  particularly  fami- 
lies divided  between  South  Korea  and  China  were  able  to  exchange 
visits  freely  in  the  late  1980s.  Nearly  2  million  ethnic  Koreans,  es- 
pecially in  the  Yanbian  Korean  Autonomous  Prefecture  in  China's 
Jilin  Province,  have  interacted  with  South  Koreans. 

It  has  been  difficult  to  determine  what  effect  the  political  tur- 
moil in  China  will  have  on  Sino-Korean  relations.  After  the  mili- 
tary crackdown  on  demonstrators  in  Beijing  in  June  1989, 
P'yongyang  predictably  came  out  in  support  of  Beijing's  repres- 
sive actions.  Seoul,  on  the  other  hand,  produced  a  more  muted 
response  that  did  not  condone  the  actions  in  Tiananmen  Square 
but  did  not  condemn  them  either.  Trade  between  the  two  coun- 
tries continued  to  increase.

Relations  with  North  Korea 

Nordpolitik's  final  destination — P'yongyang — has  proved  difficult 
to  reach.  After  nearly  two  decades,  inter-Korean  relations  had  not 
improved  measurably.  In  fact,  it  may  be  argued  that  political  leaders 
in  Seoul  and  P'yongyang  have  skillfully  used  the  perceived  mutual 
threat  to  maintain  and  justify  their  political  legitimacy.  Their  pos- 
tures may  seem  reasonable,  given  that  until  the  precarious  1953 
armistice  agreement  is  replaced  by  a  permanent  peace  treaty,  the 
Korean  War  cannot  be  considered  completely  over.  Nevertheless, 
Seoul  and  P'yongyang  have  been  increasing  their  contacts  across 
and  around  the  Demilitarized  Zone  (DMZ)  in  a  gradual  and  un- 
even fashion.  These  expanding  contacts  appear  quite  natural  be- 
cause there  are  an  estimated  10  million  separated  family  members. 
Moreover,  South  Korean  business  leaders  have  been  keenly  aware 
of  potential  economic  benefits  in  improved  relations  with  North 
Korea.  Inasmuch  as  inter-Korean  contacts  are  gradually  becom- 
ing a  "growth  industry,"  their  prospects  appear  promising. 

Inter-Korean  relations  may  be  divided  into  four  periods.  The 
first  stage  covered  the  period  between  1972  and  1973;  the  second 
stage  was  initiated  by  Pyongyang's  delivery  of  relief  goods  to  South 
Korea  after  a  typhoon  caused  devastating  floods  in  1984;  and  the 
third  stage  began  with  the  exchange  of  home  visits  and  perform- 
ing artists  in  1985.  The  fourth  stage,  activated  by  Nordpolitik  un- 
der Roh,  was  represented  by  expanding  public  and  private  contacts 
between  the  two  Koreas.  These  working-level  contacts  have  included 
Red  Cross  talks  aimed  at  exchanging  home  visits  by  divided  fami- 
lies and  performing  artists;  sports  talks  aimed  at  establishing  a  uni- 
fied team  for  the  1990  Beijing  Asian  Games;  economic  trade  at 
the  level  of  premiers;  preliminary  talks  for  joint  parliamentary  meet- 
ings; and  expanded  academic  and  religious  exchanges. 

The  Nordpolitik  blueprint — Roh's  declaration  of  July  7,  1988 — 
opened  a  new  chapter  in  inter-Korean  dialogue.  Calling  for  the 
building  of  a  single  "national  commonwealth,"  Roh  solicited  the 
assistance  of  Washington  and  Tokyo  to  improve  Seoul's  relations 
with  Moscow  and  Beijing.  At  the  same  time,  he  encouraged  Wash- 
ington and  Tokyo  to  improve  relations  with  P'yongyang  and  to  ex- 
pand inter-Korean  exchanges.  Roh  urged  a  positive  response  from 
P'yongyang;  North  Korea's  reaction,  however,  was  not  positive. 

P'yongyang  issued  an  immediate  and  detailed  statement  on  July 
11,  1988.  The  CPRF  dismissed  Roh's  proposal  as  old  wine  in  a 
new  bottle,  claiming  that  only  the  1972  three  basic  principles  for 
Korean  reunification — reunification  by  peaceful  means,  by  tran- 
scending ideological  differences  (nationalism),  and  without  external 


261 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

interference  (self-determination) — could  be  the  basis  to  improve 
inter-Korean  dialogue.  Seen  from  Pyongyang's  perspective,  Roh's 
July  7  proposal  was  nothing  more  than  a  political  ploy  to  cope  with 
increasing  radical  student  agitation  that  opposed  Seoul's  hosting 
of  the  Olympics  without  Pyongyang's  participation.  Consequendy, 
Roh's  statement  angered  rather  than  mollified  Pyongyang's 
posture,  which  was  based  on  Kim  II  Sung's  proposal  to  establish 
a  Democratic  Confederal  Republic  of  Korea. 

Meanwhile,  Seoul  began  to  speak  more  openly  about  the  rising 
level  of  direct  and  indirect  inter-Korean  trade,  much  to  the  dis- 
pleasure of  P'yongyang.  P'yongyang  claimed  that  Seoul  had  fabri- 
cated these  trade  stories.  By  1988,  however,  Seoul  began  to  reduce 
tariffs  and  other  duties  to  liberalize  trade  with  P'yongyang.  Trade 
statistics  provided  by  Seoul  and  P'yongyang  on  north- south  trade 
were  largely  unreliable  inasmuch  as  each  government  had  its  own 
reasons  for  reporting  high  or  low  figures.  Much  of  the  trade  was 
conducted  through  third  parties. 

Pyongyang's  response  to  Seoul  consisted  of  three  points:  ask- 
ing for  the  repeal  of  the  National  Security  Act,  which  designated 
P'yongyang  an  enemy;  making  a  declaration  of  nonaggression;  and 
establishing  a  "Peaceful  Reunification  Committee."  Over  the  next 
few  months,  Roh's  government  attempted  to  make  progress  toward 
satisfying  each  of  these  requirements.  In  his  October  18,  1988,  Unit- 
ed Nations  speech,  Roh  advocated  convening  a  six-nation  consul- 
tative conference  to  achieve  a  permanent  peace  setdement  in  Korea 
and  called  for  establishing  a  partnership  with  P'yongyang.  In  his 
1989  New  Year's  address,  Kim  II  Sung  extended  an  invitation  to 
the  presidents  of  the  major  South  Korean  political  parties  and  re- 
ligious leaders,  including  Cardinal  Kim  Soo  Hwan,  Reverend  Mun 
Ik-hwan,  and  Reverend  Paek  Ki-wan,  for  a  leadership-level  inter- 
Korean  reunification  meeting  to  be  held  in  P'yongyang.  However, 
any  meaningful  inter-Korean  dialogue  bogged  down  at  Pyong- 
yang's objections  to  the  annual  United  States-South  Korean  Team 
Spirit  military  exercises. 

Economic  relations  have  demonstrated  more  promise.  An  autho- 
rized public  visit  to  North  Korea  by  Chong  Chu-yong,  honorary 
chairman  of  the  Hyundai  Group,  in  early  1989  (in  technical  viola- 
tion of  South  Korea's  National  Security  Act)  was  a  remarkable 
breakthrough.  After  years  of  behind-the-scene  efforts,  Chong, 
through  a  South  Korean  intermediary  in  Japan,  was  invited  by 
P'yongyang  and  fulfilled  his  long- cherished  dream  of  seeing  his 
relatives  at  his  native  village,  near  scenic  Kumgang-san.  Chong 
was  received  in  P'yongyang  by  Ho  Tarn,  Chairman  of  the  Com- 
mittee for  the  Peaceful  Reunification  of  the  Fatherland,  and  by 


262

Republic  of  Korea,  Washington 


business  leaders  eager  to  discuss  large-scale  economic  cooperation, 
such  as  joint  ventures  and  development  of  the  tourist  industry. 
Chong's  visit  caused  euphoric  expectations  and  also  engendered  other 
visits. 

Many  of  Chong's  expected  business  dealings,  however,  suffered 
temporary  setbacks  after  his  return  to  South  Korea.  These  setbacks 
were  primarily  caused  by  the  unauthorized  visits  to  North  Korea 
of  Reverend  Mun  Ik-hwan  (March- April  1989),  South  Korean  law- 
maker So  Kyong-won  (who  had  secretly  visited  P'yongyang  in  Au- 
gust 1988,  had  been  accused  of  the  visit  in  June  28,  1989,  and  had 
been  sentenced  in  December  1989  to  fifteen  years  in  prison),  and 
dissident  South  Korean  student  representative,  Im  Su-kyong  (who 
had  attended  the  thirteenth  World  Youth  and  Student  Festival,  July 
1-8,  1989,  in  P'yongyang  and  later  had  been  sentenced  to  a  prison 
term).  The  government's  harsh  handling  of  these  visits  clearly 
showed  that  it  intended  to  keep  the  initiative  in  dealings  with  North 
Korea,  but  the  action  also  appeared  to  some  Koreans  to  contradict 
Roh' s  July  7  statement  encouraging  free  inter-Korean  contacts  at 
various  levels.  That  Roh's  statement  itself  seemed  to  disregard  the 
National  Security  Act  added  momentum  to  dissident  calls  for  the 
law's  abrogation  or  revision. 

Relations  with  International  Organizations  and  the  Third  World 

South  Korea  has  been  very  active  in  the  United  Nations  (UN) 


263 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

even  though,  as  of  1990,  it  was  not  a  member.  Seoul  has  taken 
a  vigorous  part  in  the  activities  of  various  subsidiary  and  special- 
ized UN  agencies,  as  well  as  other  international  organizations,  and 
has  had  active  permanent  missions  to  the  UN,  the  UN  Economic 
and  Social  Council  and  its  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for 
Asia  and  the  Pacific,  and  the  European  Community.  An  increas- 
ing number  of  UN  Security  Council  members,  including  the  Soviet 
Union,  tended  to  consider  seriously  Seoul's  bid  for  separate  entry 
into  the  UN.  This  move  was  vehemently  opposed  by  North  Korea, 
which  claimed  that  such  a  recognition  would  make  the  division  of 
Korea  permanent. 

Seoul's  activities  in  the  Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  Confer- 
ence (PECC)  were  particularly  noteworthy.  As  a  founding  mem- 
ber of  the  PECC,  South  Korea  played  a  key  role  in  liberalizing  trade 
networks  throughout  the  entire  Pacific  region.  The  South  Korean 
national  committee  of  the  PECC  represented  academic,  business, 
and  government  interests.  The  national  committee  was  extremely 
useful  not  only  in  formulating  Seoul's  trade  policies,  but  also  in  com- 
municating these  policies  to  other  members'  national  committees  and 
in  successfully  negotiating  mutually  advantageous  trade  agreements. 

Equally  impressive  has  been  Seoul's  diplomacy  toward  the  de- 
veloping world.  Being  a  developing  nation  itself,  South  Korea  has 
identified  with  other  developing  nations.  For  this  reason,  and  in  ap- 
parent competition  with  P'yongyang,  Seoul  has  been  actively  seek- 
ing to  improve  relations,  particularly  with  nonaligned  nations,  based 
on  the  principles  of  good  neighborliness,  reciprocity,  and  equality. 
As  of  January  1990,  Seoul  had  full  diplomatic  relations  with  seventy- 
eight  members  of  the  Nonaligned  Movement,  including  Yugosla- 
via and  Algeria.  To  promote  economic  assistance  and  expand  trade, 
Seoul  established  the  Economic  Development  Cooperation  Fund  in 
1987.  South  Korea  signed  three  loan  agreements:  US$13  million 
for  a  road  construction  project  in  Indonesia,  US$10  million  for 
modernization  of  fishing  vessels  in  Peru,  and  US$10  million  for  rail- 
way projects  in  Nigeria.  To  promote  better  relations  with  develop- 
ing countries  on  the  basis  of  south-south  cooperation,  Roh  made 
state  visits  to  Malaysia,  Indonesia,  and  Brunei  in  November  1988. 

Future  Prospects 

Seoul  became  more  globally  conscious  in  the  1980s.  South  Korean 
contacts  with  foreigners  have  been  largely  a  post-Korean  War 
phenomenon.  Indeed,  Seoul's  expanding  foreign  business  contacts 
have  been  greatiy  stimulated  by  the  fierce  rivalry  with  North  Korea. 
Seoul's  basic  goals  are  still  to  enhance  political  legitimacy,  military 
security,  and  economic  development  vis-a-vis  P'yongyang.  After  the 


264 


Government  and  Politics 


1988  Seoul  Olympics,  however,  South  Korea's  diplomatic  horizon 
was  greatly  expanded  because  of  Roh's  Nordpolitik,  which  had  suc- 
cessfully transformed  South  Korea's  sports  industry,  economic  re- 
lations, and  diplomacy  (although  its  success  with  P'yongyang  was 
limited) . 

Lacking  a  reconciliation  with  North  Korea — the  final  destina- 
tion of  Nordpolitik — Roh's  remarkable  accomplishments  will  re- 
main incomplete.  In  his  1990  New  Year  policy  statement,  Roh 
observed  that  "the  East  European  wave  of  reform  toward  freedom 
and  prosperity  is  bound  to  teach  North  Korea  before  long. ' '  He 
added  that  he  hoped  that  "similar  change  will  take  place  in  the 
North  in  an  orderly  and  peaceful  fashion."  Roh  pledged  "[a]ll- 
out  efforts  ...  to  convince  North  Korea  .  .  .  that  it  should  join 
the  trend  of  world  history  and  open  up."

A  number  of  introductory  books  on  South  Korean  domestic  pol- 
itics and  foreign  relations  are  available  in  English.  Ki-baik  Lee's 
A  New  History  of  Korea  is  a  Korean  scholar's  perspective  on  Korean 
political  history,  valuable  chiefly  for  its  examination  of  the  period 
before  1945.  Ramon  H.  Myers  and  Mark  Peattie's  The  Japanese 
Colonial  Empire,  1895-1945  sheds  light  on  the  colonial  roots  of  sub- 
sequent South  Korean  political  cultural  and  behavior.  Young  Whan 
Kihl's  Politics  and  Policies  in  Divided  Korea  compares  political  leader- 
ship and  styles  in  the  two  Koreas,  while  Ralph  N.  Clough's  Em-

extradiplomatic  foreign  policies  as  seen  through  the  prism  of  rivalry 
between  the  two  Koreas.  Dae-Kyu  Yoon's  Law  and  Political  Authority

1989  "United  States  Government  Statement  on  the  Events  in 
Kwangju,  Republic  of  Korea,  in  May  1980"  also  is  a  valuable 
document. 

Following  the  abolition  of  the  Basic  Press  Act  in  1988,  the  South 
Korean  media  became  a  rich  source  of  both  factual  and  interpre- 
tive material  on  politics  and  government.  Korea  Newsreview,  based 
on  coverage  of  the  government-owned  Korea  Herald  newspaper, 
presents  weekly  articles  concerning  politics  and  foreign  affairs, 
generally  from  a  progovernment  point  of  view;  beginning  in  1987, 
the  publication  has  also  printed  the  writings  of  dissenting  guest 
columnists.  The  full  spectrum  of  Seoul's  Korean-language  news 
media  coverage  on  political  topics  is  sampled  and  translated  in  the 
Foreign  Broadcast  Information  Service's  Daily  Report:  East  Asia. 
The  United  States  Embassy  in  Seoul  publishes  its  Press  Transla- 
tions: Korea  six  days  each  week. 

Outside  political  analysis  may  be  found  in  monthly  periodicals, 
including  Asian  Survey  and  The  Journal  of  Northeast  Asian  Studies.  The 
monthly  Korea  Update  contains  news  and  commentary  on  politics 
and  human  rights  issues.  Perceptive  accounts  of  the  political  scene 
are  found  in  Far  Eastern  Economic  Review  and  Asian  Wall  Street  Jour- 
nal, as  well  in  major  United  States  dailies  such  as  the  Washington 
Post,  New  York  Times,  and  Christian  Science  Monitor. 

Among  annual  publications  are  Korea  Annual,  published  by  the 
state- sponsored  Yonhap  News  Agency,  and  the  Asia  Yearbook,  pub- 
lished by  the  Far  Eastern  Economic  Review.  Amnesty  International's 
Report  on  Human  Rights  contains  a  chapter  on  South  Korea  in  each 
annual  edition,  as  does  the  Department  of  State's  Country  Reports 
on  Human  Rights  Practices.  (For  further  information  and  complete

DURING  SOUTH  KOREA'S  Fifth  Republic  (1981-87),  the 
modernization  of  the  armed  forces  was  one  of  the  highest  priori- 
ties of  Chun  Doo  Hwan's  administration.  As  a  result,  when  Chun's 
term  in  office  ended,  he  left  behind  one  of  the  best-equipped  mili- 
tary forces  in  Asia.  Army  units  had  been  reorganized  and  equipped 
with  indigenously  produced  weapons.  The  improvement  of  defense 
fortifications  and  supply  systems  along  the  southern  side  of  the 
Demilitarized  Zone  (DMZ)  ensured  that  ground  forces  were  bet- 
ter prepared  to  defend  South  Korea  than  at  any  time  since  the  end 
of  the  Korean  War  (1950-53).  An  automated  air  defense  system, 
jointly  managed  by  the  army  and  air  force,  reduced  the  possibility 
that  South  Korea  would  be  caught  unprepared  in  the  event  of  a 
surprise  attack.  As  a  by-product  of  rapid  industrialization  and 
coproduction  agreements  with  United  States  and  West  European 
firms,  South  Korean  aircraft  producers  and  shipbuilders  were  able 
to  supply  most  of  the  country's  needs  for  modern  fighter  aircraft, 
helicopters,  coastal  patrol  vessels,  and  other  equipment  required 
by  the  air  force  and  navy. 

A  tenuous  peace  held  throughout  the  1980s  on  the  Korean 
Peninsula — tenuous  because  the  government  of  the  Democratic  Peo- 
ple 's  Republic  of  Korea  (North  Korea)  in  P'yongyang  continued 
to  expand  its  armed  forces  and  to  deploy  two-thirds  of  all  military 
units — army,  navy,  and  air  force — in  a  combat-ready  status  close 
to  the  DMZ.  Moreover,  North  Korean-directed  terrorist  activity 
against  South  Korea  threatened  to  provoke  a  renewal  of  hostili- 
ties. In  1980  P'yongyang  and  Seoul  each  had  about  600,000  mili- 
tary personnel  on  active  duty.  From  1980  to  1985,  the  North  Korean 
armed  forces  increased  by  150,000  people,  whereas  the  South 
Korean  armed  forces  expanded  modestly  by  about  5,000  people. 
In  1990  North  Korea's  armed  forces  had  1.4  million  military  per- 
sonnel on  active  duty.  South  Korea's  armed  forces  had  650,000 
persons  on  active  duty  and  another  1,240,000  persons  in  the 
reserves. 

Under  Chun's  leadership,  Seoul  cautiously  promoted  a  peace- 
ful dialogue  with  North  Korea  and  encouraged  the  expansion  of 
north-south  contacts  in  the  early  1980s;  P'yongyang  remained  unin- 
terested in  these  overtures  and  on  at  least  two  occasions  perpetrat- 
ed terrorist  attacks  that  increased  tension  on  the  Korean  Peninsula. 
The  primary  purpose  of  South  Korean  peace  proposals  in  1981 
and  1982  was  to  realize  a  summit  meeting  between  Chun  and  North 


269 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

Korean  president  Kim  II  Sung.  South  Korean  leaders  hoped  that 
the  establishment  of  a  government- to- government  dialogue  would 
lead  to  agreements  reducing  the  size  of  the  armed  forces  of  both 
countries  and  establishing  the  framework  for  a  peace  plan  to  replace 
the  1953  armistice. 

In  October  1983,  a  P'yongyang-directed  terrorist  attack  result- 
ed in  the  cessation  of  the  peace  process.  A  bomb  that  exploded  in 
Rangoon,  Burma,  killed  twenty-one  people,  including  seventeen 
high-ranking  officials  of  the  South  Korean  government  then  visit- 
ing Burma.  The  bombing  was  planned  and  executed  by  personnel 
drawn  from  North  Korean  army  units.  Chun's  decision  not  to  retali- 
ate with  force  set  a  precedent  that  won  him  praise  from  abroad 
and  sympathy  for  his  unpopular  regime  at  home.  Seoul's  reliance 
on  diplomatic  and  economic  measures  to  counter  terrorism  rather 
than  a  small-scale  attack  on  a  North  Korean  target,  which  could 
be  used  as  an  excuse  for  beginning  an  all-out  war,  effectively  mobi- 
lized international  public  opinion  to  limit  trade  and  other  contacts 
with  North  Korea. 

Another  terrorist  attack  occurred  in  September  1987  when  two 
North  Korean  saboteurs  placed  a  bomb  on  a  Seoul-bound  Korean 
Air  Boeing  707  aircraft  carrying  ninety- five  passengers  and  twenty 
crew  members.  The  plane  exploded  over  the  Andaman  Sea  (south 
of  Burma),  killing  all  aboard.  Chun,  following  the  precedent  set 
in  1983  after  the  Rangoon  bombing,  ruled  out  military  retaliation 
and  asked  the  international  community  to  condemn  North  Korea 
for  its  continued  belligerence. 

South  Korea  also  experienced  an  increase  in  politically  motivated 
domestic  violence  during  the  1980s.  For  the  first  time,  a  small,  vocal 
segment  of  the  population  persistently  challenged  former  and  cur- 
rent military  leaders,  including  Chun,  to  stay  out  of  politics.  The 
1980  Kwangju  rebellion  was  used  by  disenfranchised  politicians 
and  disillusioned  radical  students  as  a  rallying  cry.  Moderates  were 
encouraged  to  pressure  Chun  to  change  the  constitution  and  pub- 
lic security  laws  to  guarantee  that  soldiers,  police,  and  the  intelli- 
gence services  would  never  again  be  turned  against  the  people. 
Seoul's  claims  that  the  radical  student  organizations  were  fronts 
for  North  Korea  gradually  lost  credibility,  particularly  in  1985, 
when  student  participation  in  the  political  process  contributed  to 
the  high  proportion  of  votes  cast  for  the  New  Korea  Democratic 
Party  in  that  year's  parliamentary  elections.  Public  indignation  con- 
cerning increasingly  brutal  attacks  on  dissidents  by  police  became 
a  major  political  issue  in  January  1987  when  Pak  Chong-ch'ol,  a 
Seoul  National  University  student,  was  tortured  and  subsequent- 
ly died  while  in  police  custody.  From  March  through  June  1987, 


270 


National  Security 


combat  police  units  of  the  Korean  National  Police  responsible  for 
crowd  control  were  constantly  on  the  move  as  antigovernment 
demonstrations,  sometimes  including  tens  of  thousands  of  ordinary 
citizens,  became  everyday  occurrences  in  Seoul,  Pusan,  Kwangju, 
and  other  cities. 

After  the  inauguration  of  Roh  Tae  Woo  as  president  in  Febru- 
ary 1988,  attention  once  again  reverted  to  North  Korea  as  the  fore- 
most threat  to  security.  Roh  made  good  his  promise  to  ensure  the 
safety  of  athletes  and  spectators  from  around  the  world  who  came 
to  Seoul  for  the  1988  Seoul  Olympics.  Japan  and  the  United  States 
provided  direct  security  assistance  during  this  period,  the  former 
by  closely  monitoring  the  thousands  of  airline  flights  and  visitors 
passing  through  Tokyo  and  other  Japanese  cities  en  route  to  the 
event,  the  latter  by  deploying  additional  air,  naval,  and  security 
units  in  and  around  South  Korea  before  and  during  the  Olym- 
pics. Following  the  Olympics,  Roh  relaxed  restrictions  on  South 
Korean  contacts  with  North  Koreans,  gave  in  to  increasing  demands 
for  social  spending,  and  acknowledged  growing  skepticism  about 
the  threat  from  P'yongyang,  all  of  which  resulted  in  reducing  the 
percentage  of  the  budget  spent  on  defense.  These  policies  were 
designed  to  encourage  reciprocal  moves  by  North  Korea  and  to 
reduce  tension  between  the  two  Koreas. 

In  1989  Roh  publicized  plans  to  restructure  the  South  Korean 
armed  forces  to  enhance  their  defensive  capabilities.  Seoul  also 
planned  to  acquire  new  types  of  technologically  sophisticated 
weapons  to  prepare  the  armed  forces  for  warfare  and  defense  in 
the  twenty-first  century. 

Development  of  the  Armed  Forces 
KoguryO,  Si  I  la,  and  KoryO  Kingdoms 

Historical  records  suggest  that  the  Koguryo  Kingdom  was  the  first 
Korean  state  to  emphasize  the  military  arts.  From  the  first  through 
the  fourth  centuries  A.D.,  the  Koguryo  tribes  frequently  fought 
with  Chinese  and  other  groups  for  control  of  the  region  from  the 
Liao  River  south  to  the  Yalu  River,  the  latter  forming  today's  in- 
ternational boundary  between  North  Korea  and  China.  Modern 
South  Korean  textbooks  emphasize  an  unbroken  history  of  foreign 
incursions.  Like  the  early  warrior  kings  of  Paekche  and  Silla, 
however,  King  Kwanggaet'o,  who  ruled  Koguryo  from  391  to  412, 
significantly  added  to  his  state's  territory  by  military  conquest,  absorb- 
ing neighboring  tribes  and  fortified  towns  throughout  present-day 
northeastern  China  and  down  into  the  Korean  Peninsula  (see  Silla; 


271 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

Koryo,  ch.  1).  The  Koguryo  established  military  units  in  each  of 
their  five  tribes.  Each  tribal  army  had  about  10,000  men.  An  elected 
leader  in  charge  of  all  military  forces  in  the  kingdom  headed  the 
chain  of  command.  It  was  considered  an  honor  for  a  man  to  be 
selected  to  be  a  soldier  by  the  council  of  elders. 

In  the  seventh  century,  the  Silla  Kingdom  united  Korea  south 
of  the  Taedong  River  and  successfully  resisted  repeated  campaigns 
by  the  rulers  of  Sui  (581-617)  and  Tang  (618-907)  China  to  con- 
quer all  of  Korea.  Under  Silla  rule,  the  king  placed  military  com- 
manders in  charge  of  civil  and  military  affairs  in  all  of  the  country's 
local  districts.  A  military  academy  was  established  in  the  capital 
city  of  Kyongju  and  was  open  to  young  men  of  aristocratic  birth. 
Upon  completion  of  their  training,  these  young  men  were  given 
the  title  hwarang,  meaning  Flower  Knight.  Most  of  the  great  mili- 
tary leaders  of  Silla  trained  at  this  academy  and  dedicated  their 
lives  to  military  service. 

During  the  Koryo  Dynasty  (918-1392),  Korea  remained  in- 
dependent until  the  kingdom  was  invaded  by  the  Mongols  in  1231 . 
King  Taejo  (918-39)  was  a  merchant  and  military  leader  who  re- 
unified the  peninsula  after  the  political  fragmentation  that  followed 
the  decline  of  the  Silla  Dynasty  in  the  late  ninth  century.  During 
the  reign  of  King  Munjong  (1046-83),  Korea's  northern  bound- 
aries once  again  reached  the  Yalu  and  Tumen  rivers.  King  Mun- 
jong established  two  military  districts  along  the  northern  border 
and  based  army  units  there  to  defend  the  kingdom.  Following  a 
military  coup  led  by  socially  and  economically  disgruntled  gener- 
als in  1170,  Koryo  kings  (most  notably  those  of  the  Ch'oe  family) 
became  virtual  puppets  of  military  leaders  from  1196  to  1258.  In 
1259,  at  the  end  of  several  years  of  warfare  with  the  Mongols,  Koryo 
capitulated,  becoming  a  vassal  of  the  Mongol  Yuan  Dynasty 
(1279-1364)  based  in  Dadu,  which  is  modern  Beijing  (see  The  Evo- 
lution of  Korean  Society,  ch.  1).  King  Kongmin  (1351-74), 
however,  increasingly  resisted  Yuan-imposed  institutions  and  sided 
with  the  Ming  Dynasty  (1368-1644)  against  the  Mongols.  Yi  Song- 
gye,  one  of  Kongmin's  commanders,  rebelled  against  the  effort  of 
Kongmin' s  son  to  reverse  Korea's  pro-Ming  orientation  and  in 
1392  established  the  Choson  Dynasty. 

The  Choson  Dynasty  and  the  Japanese  Colonial  Period 

In  1592  Japan  dispatched  a  force  of  approximately  170,000  men 
in  700  ships  to  conquer  Korea.  The  Japanese  army  landed  at  Pu- 
san  in  March  and  controlled  most  of  the  Korean  Peninsula  by  July. 
The  small  Korean  navy  under  Admiral  Yi  Sun-sin  used  ironclad 
battleships  known — because  of  their  appearance — as  turtle  boats

to  make  frequent  attacks  on  the  Japanese  fleet  attempting  to  resup- 
ply  Japanese  forces  in  Korea.  King  Sonjo  requested  military  assis- 
tance from  Beijing  and,  as  the  Chinese  and  Korean  armies  gradually 
pushed  the  Japanese  south,  the  Korean  navy  frustrated  Japanese 
efforts  to  initiate  new  attacks  on  the  Korean  Peninsula.  Although 
Japan's  first  attempts  to  subjugate  Korea  were  unsuccessful,  many 
of  the  central  organizations  of  the  Korean  imperial  military  sys- 
tem were  weakened  by  the  impact  of  the  invasion. 

In  the  seventeenth  and  eighteenth  centuries,  Korean  rulers  gener- 
ally devoted  little  attention  to  the  military,  although  King  Injo 
(1623-49)  did  reorganize  the  army  and  establish  five  permanent 
military  bases  in  the  country.  Military  service  became  unpopular 
after  the  Japanese  invasion.  The  yangban  (see  Glossary)  class  no 
longer  provided  a  large  source  of  strong  military  leaders,  and  the 
lower  classes  generally  preferred  to  pay  a  tax  that  exempted  them 
from  conscription.  Because  Korean  rulers  had  little  contact  with 
the  outside  world,  the  Korean  military  establishment  remained 
uninformed  about  developments  of  new  weapons  and  modern  bat- 
tlefield tactics  until  the  middle  of  the  nineteenth  century. 

In  the  late  1860s,  the  advisers  of  King  Kojong  (1864-1907), 
alarmed  by  the  interest  of  the  United  States,  France,  Russia,  and 
other  Western  countries  in  opening  Korea  to  foreign  trade,  con- 
vinced him  to  modernize  the  Korean  army.  During  the  next  two 
decades,  Korean  military  missions  travelled  to  China  and  Japan 
to  study  modern  warfare.  King  Kojong  had  neither  the  money  nor 
the  will  to  establish  a  large  army,  and  he  continued  to  rely  primarily 
on  the  Chinese  for  military  protection.  In  the  1880s,  Chinese  ad- 
visers trained  2,000  Korean  troops  and  organized  them  into  four 
elite  units  that  were  intended  to  be  King  Kojong' s  palace  guard. 
The  Tonghak  Rebellion  in  Cholla  Province  in  1894  provided  Japan 
with  an  excuse  to  dispatch  troops  to  Korea,  and  Japanese  forces 
were  sent  in  July  with  the  dual  mission  of  eliminating  Chinese  in- 
fluence on  the  Korean  Peninsula  and  laying  the  foundation  for  the 
eventual  colonization  of  the  country. 

Japanese  victories  in  the  First  Sino-Japanese  War  (1894-95)  and 
the  Russo-Japanese  War  (1904-05) — both  partially  fought  in 
Korea — left  Korea  without  any  foreign  powers  willing  to  oppose 
the  Japanese  annexation  of  Korea.  Soon  after  the  Treaty  of  Ports- 
mouth was  signed  in  July  1905,  formally  ending  the  Russo-Japanese 
War,  Japan  stationed  large  contingents  of  police  and  army  units 
in  Korea  and  disbanded  the  Korean  army.  Korea  became  a 
Japanese  colony  in  August  1910. 

In  the  1920s  and  1930s,  the  main  staging  areas  for  Korean  mili- 
tary groups  whose  aim  was  to  end  Japanese  rule  in  Korea  were 


273 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

in  Nanjing,  China;  along  the  Korean  border  in  Jilin  and  Liao- 
ning  provinces;  and  in  Irkutsk  in  the  Soviet  Union.  The  Nanjing- 
based  groups  received  military  training  from  and  supported  Chiang 
Kai-shek's  Guomindang  (Kuomintang  or  KMT — the  National  Peo- 
ple's Party,  or  Nationalist  Party).  Until  1939  there  were  several 
small  Nationalist  and  communist  military  groups  that  used  guer- 
rilla tactics  to  harass  the  Japanese  in  Korea  and  Manchuria  (as 
northeast  China  was  then  known).  By  the  end  of  1940,  the  Japanese 
Imperial  Army  had  destroyed  most  organized  resistance  along  the 
Korean  border  with  China;  many  Korean  communists  who  had 
belonged  to  these  groups  joined  the  Northeast  People's  Revolu- 
tionary Army  of  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  (see  Korea  under 
Japanese  Rule,  ch.  1).  A  small  number  of  Soviet-controlled  Korean 
military  units  were  organized  in  Irkutsk  as  early  as  1921. 

The  South  Korean  Army  after  World  War  II 

In  November  1945,  the  United  States  Army  Military  Govern- 
ment in  Korea  (1945-48)  began  the  task  of  organizing  Korean  mili- 
tary and  police  forces.  In  December  a  school  for  training  military 
officers  was  established;  the  South  Korean  National  Constabulary 
was  organized  in  January  1946.  The  United  States  originally  had 
planned  to  assist  South  Korea  in  developing  only  those  police  and 
military  organizations  necessary  to  maintain  law  and  order  dur- 
ing the  period  Korea  was  to  be  under  the  five-year  Soviet- American 
trusteeship.  By  1948,  however,  it  was  apparent  that  South  Korea 
would  need  to  expand  the  National  Constabulary  into  a  larger  and 
more  conventionally  organized  army  to  adequately  defend  itself 
from  a  possible  invasion  by  North  Korea.  For  this  reason,  the  Unit- 
ed States  provided  funds  and  training  to  expand  the  eight  provin- 
cial units  and  one  capital  city  unit  of  the  National  Constabulary 
from  regiments  to  brigades  (see  South  Korea  under  United  States 
Occupation,  1945-48,  ch.  1). 

In  November  1948,  the  Republic  of  Korea  National  Assembly 
passed  the  Armed  Forces  Organization  Act.  Under  the  provisions 
of  this  act,  the  National  Constabulary  was  reorganized  into  an  army 
comprising  seven  divisions.  In  June  1949,  when  the  last  United 
States  Army  units  deployed  in  Korea  as  part  of  the  post- World  War 
II  occupation  forces  withdrew,  leaving  behind  a  500-person  mili- 
tary advisory  group,  the  leaders  of  the  South  Korean  army  con- 
trolled an  organization  that  had  been  internally  weakened  by 
subversion  and  political  factionalism  and  that  lacked  enough  trained 
personnel  and  modern  weapons  to  prepare  adequately  for  war. 

North  Korea's  effort  to  win  control  of  the  south  using  guerrilla 
warfare  forced  South  Korea's  military  leaders  to  concentrate  on

counterinsurgency  operations.  In  the  fall  of  1949,  North  Korean 
guerrilla  units  attempted  to  gain  control  of  remote  areas  and  small 
towns  in  the  mountainous  areas  of  eastern  and  southern  South 
Korea.  It  was  estimated  that  as  many  as  5,000  guerrillas  trained 
in  North  Korea  were  infiltrated  into  these  areas  by  the  winter  of 

1949.  Two  South  Korean  army  divisions  and  one  army  brigade 
were  quickly  deployed  to  conduct  sweep  and  destroy  missions  to 
eliminate  the  guerrillas.  Counterinsurgency  operations  were  initiat- 
ed in  South  Cholla  Province  in  October  1949.  In  some  areas,  South 
Korean  villages  were  evacuated  both  to  protect  civilians  and  to  as- 
sist counterinsurgency  units  in  locating  guerrilla  bases.  By  April 

1950,  less  than  500  North  Korean  guerrillas  remained  in  South 
Korea.  Although  the  counterinsurgency  program  succeeded  in  end- 
ing the  threat  posed  by  the  guerrillas,  it  had  a  deleterious  effect 
on  the  army,  necessitating  reorganization  and  retraining  for  con- 
ventional war  preparedness. 

War  on  the  Korean  Peninsula 

When  North  Korea  invaded  South  Korea  in  June  1950,  the  poor 
quality  of  the  South  Korean  armed  forces  immediately  became  ap- 
parent. Although  South  Korea  had  94,000  troops  when  North 
Korea  began  its  all-out  surprise  attack,  one  week  later  only  20,000 
troops  could  be  accounted  for.  By  early  September  1950,  the

invading  forces  held  all  of  South  Korea  except  for  the  Pusan-Taegu 
corridor  in  the  southeast. 

The  United  Nations  (UN)  Security  Council,  upon  the  request 
of  the  United  States,  condemned  North  Korea's  invasion  of  South 
Korea  and  asked  members  of  the  UN  to  assist  South  Korea.  Fifteen 
nations  besides  the  United  States  and  South  Korea  eventually 
provided  troops;  all  forces  fought  under  the  UN  flag  and  under 
the  unified  command  of  General  Douglas  A.  MacArthur,  com- 
mander in  chief  of  UN  forces.  These  combined  forces  successfully 
broke  North  Korea's  extended  supply  lines  by  landing  at  Inch 'on 
in  September  1950.  The  invading  forces  were  pushed  back  to  near 
the  Chinese  border.  Only  the  massive  intervention  of  the  Chinese 
People's  Volunteers  (CPV)  in  October  averted  the  defeat  of  the 
North  Korean  forces.  United  Nations  and  communist  forces  fought 
to  a  standstill. 

In  July  1953,  an  armistice  was  signed  that  in  1990  remained  the 
only  agreement  preventing  the  renewal  of  hostilities  on  the  penin- 
sula. The  armistice  fixed  the  boundaries  of  the  241 -kilometer  DMZ 
as  the  border  between  North  Korea  and  South  Korea.  It  also 
established  a  Military  Armistice  Commission,  comprising  China, 
North  Korea,  the  United  States,  and  South  Korea,  to  resolve  ar- 
mistice violations  and  prevent  the  resumption  of  hostilities.  As  of 
1990,  the  Chinese  representative  still  was  posted  to  the  Military 
Armistice  Commission,  attended  its  plenary  sessions,  participat- 
ed in  secretarial  meetings,  officers  of  the  day  meetings,  language 
officers  meetings,  and  observed  Neutral  Nations  Supervisory  Com- 
mission meetings,  but  deferred  to  North  Korea's  representative. 

South  Korea's  Response  to  the  North  Korean  Military  Buildup 

In  the  1960s,  P'yongyang  began  a  sustained  expansion  of  its 
armed  forces  that  continued  without  interruption  through  the  1980s 
(see  fig.  13).  Under  presidents  Syngman  Rhee  and  Park  Chung 
Hee,  the  South  Korean  military  remained  largely  dependent  on 
the  United  States  to  deter  a  second  North  Korean  invasion  and 
to  provide  much  of  the  training  and  equipment  needed  by  the  armed 
forces.  When  the  First  Republic  (1948-60)  fell,  South  Korea's  mili- 
tary institutions  were  stronger  relatively  than  most  of  its  other 
government  agencies.  Each  service  had  a  well-established  school 
system  and  adequate  supplies  of  weapons,  ships,  and  aircraft  from 
World  War  II  and  the  Korean  War. 

Because  of  internal  politics  and  Syngman  Rhee's  policy  of  con- 
trolling the  promotion  and  assignment  of  all  general  rank  officers, 
the  military  leadership  was  already  at  the  edge  of  involvement  in  the 
nation's  politics.  Park  Chung  Hee  and  the  other  military  leaders 


276 


National  Security 


who  participated  in  the  May  1961  coup  d'etat  that  brought  down 
the  Second  Republic  (1960-61)  were  motivated  largely  by  dissatis- 
faction with  their  corrupt  and  ineffective  military  and  civilian  su- 
periors (see  The  Democratic  Interlude,  ch.  1).  They  believed  that 
South  Korea's  survival  as  a  nation  depended  on  the  reestablish- 
ment  of  social  and  economic  stability.  They  viewed  the  strength 
of  the  armed  forces  and  the  reinstitution  of  the  National  Security 
Act  of  1960  and  other  laws  intended  to  reduce  civil  disturbances 
as  necessary  means  to  restore  order  and  promote  sound  economic 
development.  By  1963  when  Park  won  election  to  the  presidency 
of  the  Third  Republic  (1963-72)  as  a  civilian,  he  already  had  placed 
other  former  military  leaders,  mostly  members  of  the  eighth  class 
of  the  Officer  Candidate  School  who  had  graduated  in  1949,  in 
key  government  positions. 

Two  of  Park's  major  objectives  during  the  Third  Republic  were 
to  improve  defense  cooperation  with  the  United  States  and  to 
modernize  the  armed  forces  (see  South  Korea  under  Park  Chung 
Hee,  1961-79,  ch.  1).  In  pursuit  of  these  goals,  Park  devoted  one- 
third  of  all  government  spending  to  defense  in  1965.  As  a  sign  of 
support  for  United  States  policies  in  Southeast  Asia  and  in  exchange 
for  the  substantial  financial  and  material  contributions  for  modern- 
izing the  army,  Park  deployed  units  of  the  South  Korean  army 
and  marine  corps  to  the  Republic  of  Vietnam  (South  Vietnam). 

In  the  early  1970s,  the  Park  administration,  with  United  States 
assistance  through  its  Foreign  Military  Sales  program,  promoted 
the  establishment  of  an  indigenous  defense  industry.  Park's  mili- 
tary advisers  were  concerned  that  Kim  II  Sung  already  had  built 
a  North  Korean  arms  industry.  The  Nixon  administration  was  call- 
ing for  Washington's  allies  to  assume  more  responsibility  for  their 
own  defense.  Nixon's  national  security  advisors  also  feared  that 
Seoul  might  be  too  weak  to  deter  a  North  Korean  invasion  unless 
it  began  to  manufacture  some  of  its  own  weapons. 

A  Defense  Industry  Bureau  was  established  in  the  Ministry  of 
National  Defense,  and  planning  for  a  defense  industry  was  incor- 
porated into  South  Korea's  first  Force  Improvement  Plan 
(1971-76).  Some  of  the  weapons  were  assembled  in  government- 
owned  plants.  Licensed  production  of  the  United  States-designed 
Colt  M-16  rifle  was  initiated  in  1971,  with  select  South  Korean 
companies  supplying  the  government  assembly  plant  with  most  of 
the  parts  for  the  weapon.  In  other  cases,  coproduction  responsibility 
was  entirely  delegated  to  civilian-managed  companies,  many  of 
which  already  had  produced  nonmilitary  items  with  technical  assis- 
tance from  various  United  States  firms.  The  Tacoma  Boatbuilding 
Company,  for  example,  assisted  a  South  Korean  shipbuilding

company  based  in  Chinhae  in  constructing  several  classes  of  patrol 
boats,  including  the  Paegu-class  derived  from  the  Asheville-class, 
which  was  equipped  with  Harpoon  antiship  missiles. 

Park's  assassination  in  1979  did  not  obscure  his  regime's  con- 
tributions to  improving  the  armed  forces  during  the  eighteen  years 
he  was  in  power.  He  reorganized  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense 
and  each  of  the  armed  services  to  enhance  the  government's  capa- 
bility to  manage  any  military  contingency,  including  an  all-out 
attack  by  North  Korea  across  the  DMZ,  small-scale  infiltrations 
along  South  Korea's  extensive  8,640-kilometer  coastiine,  and  var- 
ious types  of  low-intensity  conflict,  such  as  commando  raids  that 
targeted  industrial,  power,  and  communications  facilities,  or  at- 
tempts by  terrorists  to  assassinate  key  government  officials. 

President  Chun  Doo  Hwan  perpetuated  the  military's  dominance 
over  politics  from  December  1979  until  Roh's  inauguration  in 


278 


National  Security 


February  1988  and  protected  Park's  legacy  of  simultaneously  im- 
proving the  country's  economic  and  military  capabilities.  Chun 
continued  Park's  policy  of  devoting  one-third  of  all  government 
spending  to  the  military,  outstripping  estimated  North  Korean  mili- 
tary expenditures  during  most  of  the  1980s.  Chun  also  continued 
Park's  policy  of  promoting  defense-related  research  and  develop- 
ment and  commercial  agreements  with  the  United  States,  Japan, 
and  Western  Europe — a  policy  that  provided  Seoul  with  access  to 
more  advanced  defense  technologies.  Particular  emphasis  was 
placed  on  expanding  the  air  force  and  establishing  a  modern  air 
defense  network. 

Korean  Air,  then  South  Korea's  only  civil  airline,  began 
coproduction  of  Northrop  F5-E/F  fighter  aircraft  in  1982.  At  the 
end  of  Chun's  term  in  office,  Seoul  was  considering  coproducing 
either  the  General  Dynamics  F-16  or  the  McDonnell  Douglas 
FA- 18.  During  Chun's  administration,  South  Korean  shipbuilders 
increased  production  of  various  types  of  frigates,  missile-equipped 
fast  attack  craft,  and  other,  smaller  naval  vessels.  Civilian  indus- 
tries also  became  more  involved  in  coproduction  of  defense  ord- 
nance, including  armored  personnel  carriers,  self-propelled  artillery, 
tanks,  and  communications  equipment. 

The  Military's  Role  in  Society 

As  the  1990s  began,  the  armed  forces  remained  the  largest  and 
most  influential  government  organization  in  South  Korea.  Over 
75  percent  of  South  Korean  males  over  the  age  of  twenty  had  served 
in  the  regular  army,  the  reserves,  or  the  Homeland  Reserve  Force, 
or  had  been  assigned  duties  supporting  the  armed  forces  under  the 
Conscription  Law  of  1949.  The  National  Technicians  Law  gave 
the  Ministry  of  National  Defense  the  authority  to  order  civilian 
industrial  plants  to  produce  military  items  and  to  draft  technicians 
with  special  skills  into  military  service  during  wartime.  The  Act 
Concerning  Protection  of  Military  Secrets  limited  the  freedom  of 
the  press  to  report  on  military  affairs.  The  Military  Installation 
Protection  Law  restricted  civilian  access  to  areas  around  military 
installations. 

The  Defense  White  Paper,  1988,  a  report  on  the  armed  forces  and 
military  preparedness  and  the  first  comprehensive  document  ever 
prepared  by  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense  for  the  public,  not- 
ed several  initiatives  the  Roh  administration  had  undertaken  to 
address  these  concerns.  During  both  the  Park  and  Chun  administra- 
tions, students  who  demonstrated  against  the  government  had  been 
expelled  frequently  from  school  and  drafted  into  the  army,  where 
they  were  treated  harshly  unless  they  demonstrated  a  willingness 


279 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


to  accept  government  doctrine  on  opposing  communism,  promot- 
ing the  common  good  of  society,  and  showing  respect  for  military 
and  political  power  figures.  In  the  Defense  White  Paper,  1988,  the 
Roh  administration  announced  that  new  conscription  policies  had 
been  formulated  that  would  standardize  selection  procedures  and 
end  past  abuses.  Officers  and  noncommissioned  officers  (NCOs) 
were  under  orders  to  follow  a  new  military  protocol  that  respected 
the  rights  of  soldiers  as  citizens.  Another  measure  announced  in 
1988  was  the  abolition  of  the  Student  Defense  Corps,  a  military 
training  organization  established  at  South  Korean  colleges  in  1969 
to  provide  mandatory  lectures  on  the  government's  national  secu- 
rity policies  and  mobilization  plans  and  instruction  in  handling 
weapons  and  military  tactics. 

Changes  in  the  living  and  working  environment  on  military  bases 
were  to  include  the  gradual  elimination  of  barracks  and  office  build- 
ings constructed  in  the  1950s,  expansion  of  education  programs 
to  prepare  soldiers  for  selected  jobs  in  the  civilian  sector  before  their 
discharge,  and  small  increases  in  pay.  Additionally,  in  order  to  al- 
leviate civil-military  discord,  the  Roh  administration  planned  to 
relocate  many  of  the  bases  in  urban  areas  to  suburban  or  rural  areas 
as  soon  as  possible.  Urban  growth  around  military  installations  in 
large  cities,  including  Seoul,  Pusan,  Taejon,  Inch'on,  Ch'unch'on, 
Masan,  YVonju,  Uijongbu,  and  Chinhae,  had  compromised  the 
security  of  these  bases  and  day-to-day  military  activities;  in  turn, 
the  bases  had  disturbed  the  normal  commercial  and  social  activi- 
ties of  civilians. 

In  the  1980s,  in  addition  to  their  regular  military  duties,  mili- 
tary units  continued  the  traditional  practice  of  aiding  farmers  in 
planting  and  harvesting  rice,  assisting  civil  authorities  in  prevent- 
ing loss  of  life  and  property  during  and  following  natural  disasters, 
delivering  medical  services  in  rural  areas,  and  providing  other  so- 
cial services.  In  1987  a  total  of  561,000  military  personnel  helped 
local  farmers  plant  their  rice,  and  392,000  military  personnel  were 
made  available  for  harvesting  the  crop.  The  army  and  the 
Homeland  Reserve  Force — more  than  1  million  troops — were  mobi- 
lized in  July  1987  to  perform  rescue  operations  and  repair  wind 
and  flood  damage  caused  by  a  typhoon.  Stranded  civilians  were 
evacuated  to  safety,  temporary  dikes  were  constructed  to  prevent 
flood  damage,  debris  was  cleared  from  roads,  and  temporary 
shelters  were  constructed  for  the  homeless. 

Government  policies  on  emergency  preparedness  were  designed 
to  quickly  mobilize  civilian  personnel  and  resources  to  support  the 
military  during  wartime.  The  Military  Manpower  Law  delegated 
responsibility  to  the  Office  of  Military  Manpower  Administration 


280 


National  Security 


of  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense  for  maintaining  computerized 
records  on  all  civilians  who  were  eligible  to  serve  in  the  Homeland 
Reserve  Force.  Men  and  women  between  the  ages  of  twenty  and 
sixty  who  had  not  been  assigned  duties  in  the  military  reserves  but 
had  technical  skills  needed  by  the  military  could  also  be  assigned 
to  support  the  military  during  wartime  or  a  national  emergency 
declared  by  the  president  and  approved  by  the  National  Assembly 
under  Article  77  of  the  1987  Constitution.  As  the  1990s  began, 
an  estimated  5  million  men  and  women  were  available  for  war- 
time duties  in  the  Homeland  Reserve  Force  and  designated  civilian 
industries  that  would  produce,  repair,  and  deliver  defense  goods 
to  the  military  in  wartime.  Another  important  element  of  emer- 
gency preparedness  was  a  plan  to  mobilize  civilian  ships,  aircraft, 
heavy  construction  equipment,  and  other  types  of  vehicles  and 
equipment  useful  to  the  military  in  wartime. 

Under  provisions  of  the  Emergency  Prepared  Resources  Manage- 
ment Law,  provincial  and  local  government  authorities  were  respon- 
sible for  registering  civilian  assets  that  were  to  be  included  in  the 
plan.  Periodic  exercises  of  the  plan  were  conducted  to  test  mobili- 
zation procedures.  Local  governments  were  required  to  provide 
the  Ministry  of  National  Defense  and  other  appropriate  ministries, 
including  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  and  Ministry  of  Trans- 
portation, with  their  mobilization  plans. 

Organization  and  Equipment  of  the  Armed  Forces 

The  National  Security  Council  and  the  Ministry  of  National 
Defense  were  the  primary  executive  bodies  responsible  for  mili- 
tary affairs.  The  former,  comprising  the  prime  minister,  the  director 
of  the  Agency  for  National  Security  Planning  (ANSP),  and  the 
ministers  of  national  defense,  foreign  affairs,  home  affairs,  and 
finance,  was  responsible  for  advising  the  president  on  security  is- 
sues and  was  convened  at  the  pleasure  of  the  president.  The  Minis- 
try of  National  Defense  was  organized  into  bureaus  responsible 
for  force  development,  budget,  personnel,  reserve  forces,  logistics, 
military  installations,  medical  affairs,  the  defense  industry,  and  the 
military  education  system. 

Army 

The  ground  forces  were  organized  into  three  armies  and  sever- 
al independent  operational  and  functional  commands  (see  fig.  14). 
The  First  Army  and  the  Third  Army  occupied  well-fortified  posi- 
tions stretching  southward  from  the  DMZ  about  fifty  kilometers. 
The  First  Army's  mission  was  to  defend  the  eastern  section  of  the 
DMZ.  The  Third  Army,  South  Korea's  largest  and  most  diversified 


281 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


Figure  14.  Deployment  of  South  Korean  and  United  States  Forces  in  South 
Korea,  1990 


combat  organization,  was  responsible  for  guarding  the  most  likely 
potential  attack  routes  from  North  Korea  to  Seoul^— the  Munsan, 
Ch'orwon,  and  Tongduch'on  corridors.  The  Second  Army  had 
operational  command  over  all  army  reserve  units,  the  Homeland 
Reserve  Force,  logistics,  and  training  bases  located  in  the  six 
southernmost  provinces.  Select  army  troops  were  assigned  to  the 
Capital  Defense  Command  (formerly  the  Capital  Garrison  Com- 
mand), whose  active  duty  component,  really  more  a  countercoup 


282 


National  Security 


force  than  a  defensive  force,  was  a  little  less  than  a  division  in  1990, 
organized  into  three  separate  security  groups  or  regiments.  They 
were  assigned  to  defend  the  Blue  House  (the  presidential  residence), 
major  government  and  Ministry  of  National  Defense  buildings, 
and  Kimp'o  International  Airport.  The  wartime  strength  of  the 
Capital  Defense  Command  comes  from  multiple  division  reserves, 
which  would  be  mobilized  during  a  conflict.  The  Capital  Defense 
Command  also  was  responsible  for  peacetime  training  of  all  Seoul 
area  reserves.  Functional  commands  included  the  Counterespionage 
Operations  Command,  subordinate  to  the  chairman  of  the  Joint 
Chiefs  of  Staff  and  responsible  for  interdicting  North  Korean 
saboteurs  and  espionage  agents;  the  Defense  Security  Command, 
the  army's  internal  security  organization;  and  the  Logistics  Base 
Command,  which  was  established  to  manage  the  movement  of  sup- 
plies to  the  frontlines. 

Active-duty  infantry  units  were  organized  as  combined  armed 
forces  with  armor  and  artillery  forces  subordinate  to  the  division 
or  brigade  commander.  The  Third  Army  and  First  Army  controlled 
nineteen  infantry  divisions  and  two  mechanized  infantry  divisions. 
In  1987  each  infantry  division  had  about  14,716  soldiers  but  in 
terms  of  transportation  and  communications  and  other  equipment 
was  considered  "light"  by  United  States  standards.  Each  infantry 
division  had  four  battalions  per  regiment,  three  infantry  regiments 
and  one  artillery  regiment,  a  reconnaissance/ranger  battalion  and 
an  armor  battalion  (some  only  had  armor  companies),  and  a 
reasonable  facsimile  of  combat  support  and  combat  service  sup- 
port units  in  comparison  to  United  States  counterparts.  The  two 
mechanized  infantry  divisions  each  had  three  mechanized/ 
maneuver  brigade  headquarters,  a  cavalry  battalion,  and  a  mix 
of  nine  armor  and  mechanized  infantry  battalions. 

The  army  was  responsible  for  the  ground  component  of  South 
Korea's  air  defense  network  and  had  two  surface-to-surface  mis- 
sile battalions  and  several  antiaircraft  gun  battalions.  The  surface- 
to-surface  missile  battalions  were  equipped  with  United  States- 
produced  HAWK  and  Nike  Hercules  missiles,  the  former  having 
a  range  of  42  kilometers,  the  latter  a  range  of  140  kilometers.  The 
field  armies  had  small  quantities  of  three  types  of  man-portable, 
shoulder-launched  surface-to-air  missiles.  These  included  the 
British-produced  Javelin  and  the  United  States-produced  Redeye 
missile.  Additionally,  there  were  three  types  of  antiaircraft  guns 
in  use:  the  Swedish-produced  Bofors  L/70  40mm;  the  Swiss- 
produced  Oerlikon  GDF-002  35mm;  and  the  domestically  produced 
Vulcan  20mm. 


283 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

The  Special  Warfare  Command  had  seven  brigades  trained  for 
wartime  missions  behind  enemy  lines.  Although  information  on 
the  organization  of  these  units  was  unavailable  in  1990,  they  prob- 
ably were  among  the  best-trained  and  most  combat-ready  forces 
in  the  army. 

A  single  aviation  brigade  operated  several  types  of  attack  and 
transport  helicopters  that  could  be  strategically  deployed  to  sup- 
port combat  operations  of  the  infantry  divisions  and  special  forces. 
Some  200  McDonnell  Douglas  500-MD  helicopters  were  produced 
under  license  by  Korean  Air  between  1976  and  1984.  At  least  fifty 
of  these  helicopters  were  equipped  with  TOW  antitank  weapons. 
The  remainder  were  used  as  transports  and  for  other  support  mis- 
sions. In  1990  South  Korea  also  had  about  50  McDonnell  Doug- 
las AH- IS  attack  helicopters  and  144  McDonnell  Douglas 
UH-1B/H  transport  helicopters. 

The  role  of  women  in  the  army  has  changed  in  the  late  twen- 
tieth century.  A  small,  all-volunteer  Women's  Army  Corps  (WAC) 
was  made  a  separate  unit  of  the  army  in  1971.  Women  were  re- 
quired to  be  high-school  graduates,  they  were  enlisted  for  a  two- 
year  tour  of  duty,  and  their  military  occupational  specialties  were 
limited  to  nursing  and  a  few  other  noncombat  positions. 

In  September  1989,  the  National  Assembly  revised  the  military 
personnel  law  which  governed  the  WAC ,  and  the  WAC  was  offi- 
cially deactivated  on  December  30,  1989.  Female  soldiers  were  for- 
mally reassigned  to  seven  branches  within  the  army:  infantry, 
administration,  intelligence,  finance,  education  and  information, 
logistics,  and  medical  service.  A  separate  WAC  school  and  per- 
sonnel center  remained. 

Between  1980  and  1990,  the  army  increased  in  size  by  only  a 
small  margin.  During  this  same  period,  however,  new  units  were 
formed;  the  procurement  of  new  tanks,  armored  personnel  carri- 
ers, field  artillery,  antitank  guns,  air  defense  missiles,  helicopters, 
and  other  types  of  military  equipment  significantly  improved  the 
defensive  capabilities  of  the  ground  forces  (see  table  16,  Appen- 
dix). In  1980  the  army  had  approximately  1,200  United  States- 
produced  M-47  and  M-48  tanks  and  500  mostly  United  States- 
produced  M-l  13  armored  personnel  carriers  (also  some  Fiat  6614 
wheeled  armored  personnel  carriers).  By  1990  South  Korea  had 
manufactured  200  of  the  domestically  produced  T-88  tank  and  had 
upgraded  most  of  its  M-48s  to  M-48A3s  or  M-48A5s.  During  the 
period  from  1980  to  1990,  the  number  of  field  artillery  pieces  more 
than  doubled,  going  from  2,000  to  4,200  pieces,  and  South  Korea 
began  to  introduce  larger  guns  to  extend  the  effective  range  of  fire. 
In  1980  the  army  was  equipped  with  57mm,  75mm,  90mm,  and 


284 


National  Security 


106mm  recoilless  rifles  for  antitank  use  and  TOWs.  In  1990  the 
TOW  and  LAW  still  were  the  primary  antitank  weapons.  The 
106mm/90mm  recoilless  rifles  increased  in  numbers  and  were  the 
basic  antitank  system  for  the  infantry,  although  lower  caliber 
weapons  still  existed.  The  TOWs  were  relatively  scarce  and  were 
organized  into  independent  units  separate  from  the  infantry  divi- 
sions' main  organization  and  equipment.  The  national  air  defense 
network  comprised  only  100  Vulcan  antiaircraft  guns  and  a  small 
number  of  Nike-Hercules  and  HAWK  surface-to-air  missiles  in 
1980;  by  1990  there  were  600  antiaircraft  guns,  and  the  Nike- 
Hercules  and  HAWKs  had  both  increased  in  number  and  under- 
gone significant  upgrades. 

Air  Force 

The  air  force  was  organized  into  three  commands  operating  ap- 
proximately 700  aircraft  from  eight  major  airbases:  the  Combat 
Air  Command  controlled  the  bulk  of  the  roughly  500  jet  combat 
aircraft;  a  small  Air  Transportation  Command  had  37  transport 
aircraft;  and  the  Air  Training  Command  used  7  types  of  trainers 
(see  table  17,  Appendix).  In  1990  the  air  force  had  40,000  person- 
nel on  active  duty.  Most  of  these  personnel  were  stationed  at  large, 
well-defended  air  bases  located  at  Suwon,  Osan,  Ch'ongju,  Kang- 
nung,  Taegu,  Kunsan,  Kwangju,  and  Sunch'on.  The  air  force  also 
operated  an  unknown  number  of  smaller  airbases.  Civilian  airfields, 
including  three  international  airfields  at  Seoul,  Pusan,  and  Cheju, 
would  be  utilized  in  wartime,  as  would  specially  designed  sections 
of  major  highways. 

The  Combat  Air  Command,  headquartered  at  Osan,  controlled 
aircraft  that  included  twenty-two  squadrons  of  ground  attack  fight- 
ers/interceptors, twenty-three  counterinsurgency  aircraft  in  one 
squadron,  twenty  reconnaissance  aircraft  in  one  squadron,  and 
fifteen  search-and-rescue  helicopters  in  one  squadron.  All  of  these 
aircraft  were  produced  in  the  United  States,  with  the  exception  of 
sixty-eight  Northrop  F-5E/Fs  that  were  coproduced  with  Korean 
Air.  The  294  Northrop  F-5s  and  36  General  Dynamics  F-16C/Ds 
were  the  primary  ground  attack  aircraft.  Approximately  130 
McDonnell  Douglas  F-4s  were  deployed  for  air  defense  but  were 
equally  useful  in  ground  attack.  All  three  types  of  aircraft  were  capa- 
ble of  being  used  in  either  role,  depending  on  their  armament.  The 
air  force  supported  army  counterinsurgency  programs  with  twenty- 
three  Cessna  A-37  aircraft,  used  as  forward  air  controllers,  but 
which  could  also  be  used  in  ground  attack.  Eight  Northrop  F-5s 
and  twelve  McDonnell  Douglas  F-4s  were  equipped  solely  for 


285 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


reconnaissance.  A  total  of  fifteen  Bell  UH-1B  and  UH-1H  helicop- 
ters were  available  for  search-and-rescue  operations. 

During  the  1980s,  the  air  force  modernization  program  focused 
primarily  on  the  formation  and  deployment  of  twelve  new  fighter 
aircraft  squadrons  and  the  establishment  of  an  automated  air  defense 
network.  The  F-16  provided  South  Korea  with  an  aircraft  believed 
to  be  technologically  superior  to  similarly  designed  communist  air- 
craft, including  the  Soviet-produced  MiG-29,  the  most  sophisti- 
cated aircraft  employed  by  the  North  Korean  air  force.  South 
Korea-United  States  coproduction  of  F-5  aircraft  demonstrated  the 
resolve  of  South  Korean  military  planners  to  promote  a  defense 
industry  that  simultaneously  utilized  advanced  United  States  tech- 
nology while  enhancing  indigenous  efforts  both  at  establishing  an 
aviation  industry  and  increasing  access  to  Western  technology. 

The  Tactical  Air  Control  Center  at  Osan  became  operational 
in  1983.  Reconnaissance  aircraft  and  air  defense  radar  sites  in- 
formed the  center  about  potentially  hostile  aircraft  before  they  en- 
tered South  Korean  airspace.  In  wartime  this  capability  was 
expected  to  allow  South  Korean  air  controllers  more  time  to  as- 
sess threat  and  the  ability  quickly  to  communicate  orders  to  inter- 
ceptor aircraft  and  surface-to-air  missile  sites. 

Navy  and  Marine  Corps 

In  1990  the  navy  and  marine  corps  remained  small  forces  primar- 
ily dedicated  to  protecting  the  nation's  territorial  waters  and  islands. 
There  was  one  large  naval  base  at  Chinhae,  and  seven  small  naval 
stations  located  at  Cheju,  Inch'on,  Mokp'o,  Mukho,  Pukp'yong-ni, 
P'ohang,  and  Pusan.  Both  the  navy  and  marine  corps  were  subor- 
dinate to  the  chief  of  naval  operations,  who  was  a  member  of  the 
Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff.  The  navy,  with  35,000  personnel,  was  organi- 
zed into  three  fleet  commands  and  separate  commands  for  aviation, 
amphibious  operations,  mine  warfare,  training,  and  logistics — all 
subordinate  to  the  first  vice  chief  of  naval  operations.  The  marine 
corps,  with  25,000  personnel,  was  organized  into  two  divisions  and 
one  brigade  under  the  Marine  Corps  Command.  Although  part 
of  the  navy,  marine  units  often  operated  under  army  control. 

During  the  1980s,  the  navy's  modernization  program  focused 
on  antisubmarine  warfare  and  the  deployment  of  new  types  of  in- 
digenously produced  submarines,  frigates,  missile-equipped  fast 
attack  craft,  and  patrol  boats.  Naval  vessels  deployed  with  the 
Eastern,  Western,  and  Southern  fleets  were  equipped  with  modern 
sonar  equipment,  depth  charges,  and  torpedoes  to  counter  more 
effectively  North  Korea's  growing  submarine  force  (see  table  18, 
Appendix).  Two  types  of  United  States-produced  and  one  type  of 


286 


National  Security 


French-produced  shipborne  surface-to-surface  and  surface-to-air 
missiles  were  used  by  the  navy  on  its  destroyers,  frigates,  and  fast 
attack  craft.  United  States-produced  Harpoon  surface-to-surface 
missiles,  with  a  ninety-kilometer  range,  were  deployed  on  Gearing- 
class  destroyers,  Ulsan-class  frigates,  and  Paegu-class  fast  attack 
craft  derived  from  the  Ashville-class.  French-produced  Exocet 
surface-to-surface  missiles,  with  a  seventy-kilometer  range,  were 
employed  on  Donghae  frigates  and  Kirogi-class  fast  attack  craft. 
Paegu  fast  attack  craft  were  equipped  with  United  States-produced 
Standard  surface-to-air  missiles. 

The  Naval  Aviation  Command  and  the  Naval  Amphibious  Com- 
mand operated  small  fleets  of  aircraft  and  landing  craft,  respec- 
tively, to  support  naval  fleet  and  marine  corps  operations. 
Twenty-five  Grumman  S-2  aircraft,  twenty-five  Hughes  500-MD 
helicopters,  and  ten  Bell  SA-316  helicopters  were  shore  based.  They 
were  deployed  for  surveillance  of  surface  ships  and  for  antisubma- 
rine warfare. 

The  marine  corps  was  assigned  the  defense  of  the  Han  River 
estuary  and  five  northwestern  islands  located  close  to  North  Korea. 
The  Naval  Amphibious  Command  operated  fifty-two  amphibious 
craft  in  support  of  the  marine  corps. 

Reserve  and  Civil  Defense  Forces 

The  reserve  forces  included  mobilization  reserve  forces  for  each 
of  the  armed  services  and  the  Homeland  Reserve  Force,  a  paramili- 
tary organization  responsible  for  community  and  regional  defense. 
Between  1968  and  1988,  males  between  the  ages  of  eighteen  and 
forty  were  eligible  for  defense  call-up  duty;  there  was  no  clear  policy 
on  the  age  at  which  a  recruit  was  eligible  for  retirement.  In  Janu- 
ary 1988,  a  new  policy  was  instituted  that  reduced  the  age-group 
of  the  male  population  subject  to  service  in  the  reserves:  only  males 
who  had  been  drafted  for  service  between  the  ages  of  nineteen  and 
thirty-four  were  required  to  serve  in  the  reserves.  The  period  of 
service  was  limited  to  between  six  and  eight  years,  depending  on 
the  individual's  age  at  conscription. 

The  mission  of  the  mobilization  reserves  was  to  provide  each 
of  the  services  with  well-trained  personnel  prepared  to  enter  com- 
bat as  soon  as  possible  in  wartime.  In  1990  there  were  1,240,000 
men  in  the  reserves:  1,100,000  in  the  army;  60,000  in  the  marines; 
55,000  in  the  air  force;  and  25,000  in  the  navy.  Most  recruits  had 
served  on  active  duty  in  their  respective  services  and  were  assigned 
to  a  reserve  unit  upon  completion  of  their  term  of  enlistment.  Units 


287 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

in  the  reserves  probably  closely  resembled  active-duty  organiza- 
tions. Mobilization  reserve  personnel  attended  regularly  scheduled 
training  about  one  day  a  month  and  also  participated  in  an  annu- 
al field  exercise  that  lasted  about  one  week.  Active-duty  officers 
and  NCOs  were  assigned  to  command  and  staff  positions  in  the 
reserves  at  battalion  and  higher  levels. 

The  Homeland  Reserve  Force  was  established  in  April  1968  as 
part  of  a  nationwide  program  to  increase  defense  preparedness  in 
the  wake  of  North  Korean  provocations.  In  January  1968,  a  North 
Korean  commando  unit  infiltrated  Seoul  and  attacked  the  Blue 
House  in  an  attempt  to  assassinate  President  Park  Chung  Hee. 
That  same  month,  two  additional  North  Korean  commando  units 
launched  attacks  on  towns  on  the  east  coast  in  attempts  to  encourage 
the  South  Korean  populace  to  overthrow  the  government. 
Homeland  Reserve  Force  personnel  were  given  basic  training  in 
physical  fitness,  weapons  familiarization,  and  defense  tactics  against 
various  types  of  attacks  by  enemy  forces.  In  wartime  these  units 
would  remain  close  to  or  in  their  own  cities,  villages,  or  towns, 
where  they  would  guard  roads,  power  plants,  factories,  and  other 
potential  military  targets. 

In  1975  the  National  Assembly  passed  the  Civil  Defense  Law, 
which  was  promulgated  to  establish  organizations  in  every  com- 
munity to  protect  lives  and  property  during  wartime  and  natural 
disasters.  Males  between  the  ages  of  nineteen  and  fifty  who  were 
not  drafted  for  service  in  the  military  were  recruited  for  service 
in  civil  defense  units.  In  1980  there  were  over  90,000  civil  defense 
personnel  in  the  country.  By  1990  their  numbers  were  more  than 
3.5  million.  Their  missions  included  air  raid  defense,  search  and 
rescue,  and  building  and  road  repair. 

Recruitment,  Training,  and  Conditions  of  Service 

All  males,  except  for  a  small  percentage  of  individuals  considered 
physically  or  socially  undesirable  for  military  service,  could  be  draft- 
ed into  the  army.  In  1990  there  were  407,000  males  nineteen  years 
of  age  who  were  required  to  register  for  military  service.  Approxi- 
mately 9.2  percent  of  these  young  men  were  rejected  for  conscrip- 
tion for  one  of  the  following  reasons:  having  a  physical  or  mental 
disability;  possessing  a  criminal  record;  being  an  orphan;  and  be- 
ing born  out  of  wedlock  or  having  one  parent  who  was  not  a  South 
Korean  citizen.  Conscripts  were  required  to  have  at  least  an  elemen- 
tary school  education;  77  percent  of  those  drafted  had  at  least  a 
high  school  education. 

The  Military  Manpower  Agency  was  responsible  for  assigning 
recruits  to  the  army,  navy,  marines,  the  Korean  Augmentation 


288 


Army  troops  participate  in  offshore  training  exercise.

of  the  United  States  Army  (KATUSA),  and  the  combat  police  units 
of  the  Korean  National  Police.  Recruits  could  request  assignment 
to  a  particular  service  and  were  assigned  based  on  their  education, 
technical  skills,  and  physical  condition.  About  85  percent  of  eligi- 
ble recruits  were  drafted  for  periods  of  between  thirty  and  thirty- 
six  months.  Candidates  for  the  KATUSA  program  were  required 
to  be  high  school  graduates  with  some  English-language  training. 
In  1990  approximately  5,000  men  in  KATUSA  served  with  the 
United  States  Army  units  in  South  Korea.  In  1990  the  air  force 
was  an  all-volunteer  force. 

The  conscription  system  was  flexible  and  allowed  most  young 
men  to  plan  their  service  in  a  way  that  would  promote  their  in- 
dividual career  goals.  High  school  graduates  who  had  been  accepted 
into  a  college  or  technical  school  or  who  were  attending  such  schools 
were  granted  deferments.  Conscripts  with  good  education  records 
and  aptitudes  suited  to  particular  military  specialties  were  select- 
ed to  be  trained  as  specialists  in  combat  support  branches  such  as 
signals,  ordnance,  and  engineers.  Even  conscripts  assigned  to  com- 
bat, however,  were  encouraged  to  take  classes  during  their  terms 
of  duty  to  prepare  for  employment  when  they  left  the  service. 

The  army,  navy,  and  air  force  each  had  a  full  range  of  recruit 
training  centers,  schools  for  technical  military  occupational  specialties, 


289 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


and  officer  training  courses.  Army  recruits  were  transported  from 
provincial  induction  centers  to  one  of  the  Second  Army's  recruit 
training  centers  for  basic  training.  Each  branch  of  the  army  had 
one  or  more  schools  that  offered  curricula  for  enlisted  personnel, 
NCOs,  and  officers.  The  large  number  of  schools  and  the  diversi- 
fied training  programs  available  to  servicemen  supported  the  ar- 
my's need  for  skilled  personnel  to  use,  maintain,  repair,  and 
resupply  combat  forces  during  wartime.  The  air  force  had  schools 
for  pilots,  air  technicians,  communication  and  electronics  specialists, 
aircraft  maintenance  specialists,  and  air  traffic  controllers.  The  navy 
had  its  own  schools  oriented  to  the  needs  of  the  three  fleets  and 
the  marine  corps. 

All  officers  and  enlisted  personnel  were  closely  supervised  and 
had  to  obey  strict  security  regulations  that  limited  their  contacts 
with  civilians,  including  their  own  families.  All  military  personnel 
were  provided  with  food,  clothing,  housing,  and  medical  services. 
A  variety  of  entertainment  and  recreational  programs  were  or- 
ganized on  military  installations  to  reduce  boredom  and  promote 
the  physical  health  and  morale  of  service  personnel. 

Officers  and  Noncommissioned  Officers 

Officers  were  graduates  of  army,  navy,  or  air  force  service  acade- 
mies, reserve  officer  training  cadet  programs  offered  at  civilian  col- 
leges, or  were  recruited  from  enlisted  personnel  for  selected 
short-term  service  in  noncombat  occupational  billets.  More  than 
90  percent  of  the  field- grade  officers  chosen  to  command  combat 
units  at  battalion  and  higher  levels  were  graduates  of  the  Korea 
Military  Academy  (in  the  case  of  the  army),  the  Air  Force  Acade- 
my, or  the  Naval  Academy.  Applicants  were  chosen  on  the  basis 
of  their  academic  records,  performance  in  competitive  examina- 
tions, physical  condition,  and  dedication  to  the  mission  of  the  armed 
forces.  Each  academy  offered  a  four-year  curriculum  to  provide 
the  cadet  with  a  bachelor's  degree  and  practical  military  skills. 
Graduates  of  the  military  academies  were  required  to  serve  ten  years 
in  the  military  and  made  up  5  percent  of  the  newly  commissioned 
officers  each  year.  Approximately  40  percent  of  the  new  second 
lieutenants  were  commissioned  from  the  Reserve  Officer  Train- 
ing Corps  (ROTC)  after  two  years'  training  and  a  two-year,  three- 
month  obligation.  Another  40  percent  of  the  new  second  lieutenants 
were  from  the  Third  Military  Academy,  which  had  a  twenty-  to 
thirty-six  week  training  course.  The  remaining  15  percent  were 
direcdy  commissioned  specialists,  including  personnel  in  the  medical 


290 


National  Security 


corps,  judge  advocates,  and  chaplains.  Most  of  the  recruits  of  the 
Third  Military  Academy  were  newly  graduated  from  junior  col- 
leges or  regular  colleges.  At  one  time  the  Third  Military  Academy 
was  itself  a  two-year  college.  Historically,  most  of  the  ROTC  officers 
left  after  completing  their  obligation,  but  the  graduates  of  the  Third 
Military  Academy  often  stayed  on  to  field-grade  rank  and  were 
the  dominant  source  of  commission  at  that  rank. 

Advanced  individual  training  for  officers  was  provided  at  the 
Army's  Command  and  General  Staff  College,  the  National  Defense 
College,  and  military  training  institutes  in  other  countries.  The 
Command  and  General  Staff  College  prepared  selected  field- grade 
officers  for  command  and  staff  duties  at  division,  corps,  and  army 
levels.  The  National  Defense  College  trained  a  limited  number  of 
selected  senior  officers  of  the  three  services  and  some  civilian  govern- 
ment officials  for  the  highest  command  and  staff  positions. 

Each  army  branch,  as  well  as  the  air  force,  navy,  and  marine 
corps,  was  responsible  for  selecting  NCOs  for  training  in  their  oc- 
cupational specialty.  Those  selected  were  required  to  reenlist  for 
two  to  seven  years,  depending  on  the  availability  of  replacements 
in  their  branch.  Army  staff  sergeants  were  selected  from  civilian 
applicants  and  eligible  enlisted  personnel  who  had  completed  the 
required  courses  of  studies  in  branch  schools.  The  navy  recruited 
petty  officers  through  examination  at  the  time  of  conscription.  Af- 
ter finishing  basic  training,  candidates  were  trained  for  their  duties 
in  a  branch  school.  The  air  force  followed  a  procedure  similar  to 
the  navy's.  Combat  marines  were  sent  to  army  schools  for  NCO 
training,  whereas  marines  in  service  branches  usually  attended  navy 
schools. 

Enlisted  Personnel 

Recruit  training  in  each  of  the  services  lasted  about  sixteen  weeks 
and  focused  on  physical  conditioning,  basic  military  skills,  and  the 
functions  of  combat  and  combat  support  units.  Conscripts  select- 
ed to  serve  in  the  army  and  marine  corps  were  sent  to  Second  Army 
recruit  training  centers  for  basic  training.  The  navy  and  air  force 
operated  their  own  recruit  training  centers. 

Uniforms,  Ranks,  and  Insignia 

The  rank  and  grade  structure  of  the  three  services  correspond- 
ed, with  minor  exceptions,  to  that  of  the  United  States  forces,  as 
did  the  correlation  between  rank  and  responsibility  (see  fig.  15). 
In  peacetime,  the  army  and  air  force  were  each  commanded  by 
a  four-star  general;  a  lieutenant  general  commanded  the  marines, 
and  an  admiral  commanded  the  navy. 


291

Service  uniforms  also  resembled  those  of  the  United  States  forces 
in  color  and  style.  Service  personnel  wore  a  summer  uniform  of 
denim  and  a  winter  uniform  of  wool.  Troops  in  forward  areas  wore 
a  more  expensive  padded  winter  uniform.  Noncommissioned 
officers  of  the  army  and  air  force  wore  a  tunic  buttoned  to  the  top; 
navy  noncommissioned  officers  wore  the  United  States-type  sea- 
man's blouse.  Officers'  uniforms  were  similar  to  those  worn  by 
officers  of  the  United  States. 

Defense  Spending  and  Military  Production 

From  the  end  of  the  Korean  War  to  1990,  South  Korea  had 
evolved  from  a  country  dependent  on  other  nations  for  its  nation- 
al security  to  a  strong  and  growing  nation,  increasingly  capable 
of  meeting  its  own  defense  needs.  Civilian  industries  maintained 
military  assembly  lines  as  a  separate,  and  generally  small,  part  of 
their  corporate  activities. 

Defense  Spending 

Seoul's  defense  budget  increased  in  proportion  to  the  growth  of 
the  national  economy  throughout  the  1970s  and  1980s,  demonstrat- 
ing how  strongly  national  leaders  felt  about  improving  the  armed 
forces  (see  fig.  16).  Between  1971  and  1975,  defense  spending  in- 
creased from  US$411  million  to  US$719  million.  Defense  expen- 
ditures averaged  about  4.5  percent  of  the  country's  gross  national 
product  (GNP — see  Glossary).  In  1976,  the  first  year  that  the 
government  included  proceeds  from  the  defense  tax  in  published 
figures  for  military  expenditures,  the  budget  for  the  armed  forces 
and  defense  industries  increased  100  percent  over  the  1975  figure 
to  US$1 .5  billion.  The  costs  involved  in  initiating  weapons  produc- 
tion and  the  loss  of  military  grant  aid  from  the  United  States  were 
the  major  reasons  for  the  gradual  increase  of  defense  spending  from 
5.2  percent  of  GNP  in  1979  to  6.2  percent  of  GNP  in  1982.  By 
1990  defense  spending  had  increased  to  almost  US$10  billion  a  year, 
but  because  of  the  dramatic  growth  in  the  country's  economy,  this 
figure  was  below  30  percent  of  the  government's  budget  and  less 
than  5  percent  of  GNP  for  the  first  time  since  1975. 

Annual  defense  budgets  were  proposed  by  the  Ministry  of  Na- 
tional Defense  and  approved  by  the  president  following  consulta- 
tions with  the  National  Assembly.  Beginning  in  fiscal  year  (FY — see 
Glossary)  1979,  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense  adopted  a  budget 
management  system  based  on  the  United  States  Department  of 
Defense  project  planning  budget  system.  The  South  Korean  system

focused  on  force  modernization  and  the  maintenance  of  military 
organizations  in  peacetime  at  70  percent  of  their  wartime  strength. 
The  government's  mobilization  and  resource  management  plans 
for  support  of  the  military  were  designed  to  bring  the  armed  forces 
up  to  full  strength  quickly  and  to  maintain  the  country's  capabili- 
ty to  supply  the  military  during  wartime.  Under  the  1987  Consti- 
tution, the  National  Assembly  was  accorded  more  responsibility 
to  review  the  defense  budget  and  to  recommend  appropriate  lev- 
els of  spending.  In  1990,  however,  the  president  continued  to  have 
the  final  say  on  budget  matters. 

Approximately  40  percent  of  the  defense  budget  was  devoted 
to  weapons  and  equipment  modernization  in  1990.  Defense  plan- 
ners established  a  number  of  long-range  goals:  to  establish  an 


294 


National  Security 


independent  reconnaissance  system  with  intelligence  satellites  and 
early  warning  aircraft;  to  improve  the  quality  of  firepower  and  the 
accuracy  of  domestically  produced  weapons;  to  deploy  indigenously 
produced  surface-to-air  and  tactical  surface-to-surface  missiles;  and 
to  replace  outdated  fighter  aircraft  and  naval  vessels  with  techno- 
logically advanced  models  that  would  neutralize  the  threat  of  North 
Korea's  modern  weapon  systems. 

The  operational  costs  of  the  three  armed  services  constituted  ap- 
proximately 35  percent  of  the  defense  budget.  Improvements  in 
training,  logistical  support  to  combat  units,  and  pay  and  benefits 
provided  to  military  personnel  were  a  part  of  the  increased  cost 
of  supporting  the  armed  forces.  The  acquisition  of  sophisticated 
new  types  of  weapons,  although  contributing  to  national  security, 
also  increased  operational  costs. 

The  remaining  25  percent  of  the  defense  budget  was  mostly  al- 
located among  the  armed  forces  reserves;  South  Korea's  share  of 
the  United  States-Republic  of  Korea  combined  defense  improve- 
ment program;  research  into  new  defense  technologies;  and  con- 
struction and  maintenance  of  military  installations. 

Military  Production 

The  Defense  Industry  Bureau  of  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense 
was  the  government  agency  responsible  for  managing  the  quanti- 
ty and  quality  of  domestically  produced  weapons  and  equipment. 
In  1990  South  Korean  industries  provided  about  70  percent  of  the 
weapons,  ammunition,  communications  and  other  types  of  equip- 
ment, vehicles,  clothing,  and  other  supplies  needed  by  the  military. 

Weapons  production  for  the  army  began  in  1971  when  the  Minis- 
try of  National  Defense  constructed  a  plant  to  assemble  United  States- 
designed  Colt  M-16  rifles.  The  memorandum  of  agreement  between 
the  United  States  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  authorized  produc- 
tion of  enough  rifles  to  supply  South  Korean  army  units.  However, 
the  agreement  prohibited  the  production  of  additional  M-16s 
without  the  permission  of  Colt  Industries  and  the  United  States 
government.  In  the  mid-1970s,  South  Korea  signed  agreements 
to  begin  licensed  production  of  many  types  of  United  States- 
designed  weapons,  including  grenades,  mortars,  mines,  and  recoil- 
less  rifles,  with  the  same  stipulations  as  those  for  the  M-16  rifle. 
South  Korea  also  began  to  manufacture  ammunition  for  the 
weapons  it  produced  for  the  army. 

By  1990  South  Korean  companies  had  army  contracts  to  produce 
tanks,  self-propelled  and  towed  field  guns,  two  types  of  armored 
vehicles,  and  two  types  of  helicopters.  A  division  of  Hyundai 


295 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

produced  the  88  Tank  (formerly  called  the  K-l  tank)  at  Ch'ang- 
won.  The  K-l  was  the  result  of  a  joint  United  States-South  Korean 
design.  The  88  Tank's  105mm  gun  was  an  improved  version  of 
the  same  caliber  gun  that  was  standard  on  South  Korea's  M-48A5 
tanks.  Although  a  few  components  of  the  tanks'  fire  control  and 
transmission  systems  were  imported,  Hyundai  and  South  Korean 
subcontractors  manufactured  most  of  the  systems.  One  of  the  Sam- 
sung Group's  businesses  produced  155mm  M-109  self-propelled 
howitzers.  Kia  Machine  Tool  was  the  manufacturer  for  the  KH-178 
105mm  and  the  KH-179  155mm  towed  field  guns.  The  KH-178 
and  KH-179  guns  were  derived  from  United  States-designed  ar- 
tillery but  were  considered  indigenously  designed.  Daewoo  Indus- 
tries and  Asia  Motors  had  a  coproduction  agreement  for  an 
Italian-designed  wheeled,  armored  personnel  vehicle.  Bell  Helicop- 
ters Textron  of  the  United  States  and  Samsung  coproduced  UH-1 
helicopters.  Sikorsky  Aircraft  Corporation,  also  of  the  United  States, 
had  a  contract  with  Daewoo  to  coproduce  H-76  helicopters. 

In  December  1989,  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense  selected 
the  McDonnell  Douglas  FA- 18  to  be  the  second  United  States- 
designed  fighter  aircraft  to  be  coproduced  in  South  Korea.  Sam- 
sung's aerospace  division  was  awarded  a  contract  to  manufacture 
the  airframe  and  engine;  Lucky-Goldstar  became  the  subcontrac- 
tor for  the  aircraft's  avionics.  McDonnell  Douglas  agreed  to  deliver 
twelve  FA- 18s  to  the  South  Korean  air  force  in  1993  and  to  assist 
Samsung  with  the  later  assembly  of  108  aircraft  in  South  Korea. 
As  of  1990,  the  entire  FA- 18  program  was  under  review  because 
of  increased  costs.  Korean  Air  used  its  depot  maintenance  facili- 
ties at  Kimhae  to  overhaul  most  types  of  aircraft  in  service  with 
the  South  Korean  air  force.  Additionally,  the  United  States  Air 
Force  contracted  with  Korean  Air  for  the  maintenance  of  its  F-4, 
F-15,  A-10,  and  C-130  aircraft  stationed  in  South  Korea,  Japan, 
and  the  Philippines. 

In  1990  South  Korean  shipbuilders  were  building  two  indigenous- 
ly designed  naval  vessels,  and  they  had  coproduction  agreements 
with  United  States,  Italian,  and  German  companies  for  several  other 
types  of  ships.  Four  shipbuilders — Hyundai,  Daewoo,  Korea  Ta- 
coma,  and  Korean  Shipbuilding  and  Engineering — constructed 
South  Korean-designed  Ulsan-class  frigates  and  Tonghae-class  cor- 
vettes for  the  navy.  During  the  1980s,  Korea  Tacoma,  a  South 
Korean-owned  subsidiary  of  the  United  States  Tacoma  Boatbuild- 
ing Company,  produced  one  class  of  patrol  gunboat  and  one  class 
of  landing  ship  for  the  navy.  The  Kirogi-class  patrol  boat  was  a 
larger  model  of  the  Tacoma-designed  Schoolboy-class  patrol  boat 
manufactured  in  South  Korea  during  the  1970s.  The  Kirogi-class 


296 


National  Security 


patrol  boat,  a  170-ton  vessel,  required  a  thirty-one-person  crew 
and  was  equipped  with  five  guns:  one  40mm  single-barreled  Bofors 
on  the  bow,  two  30mm  twin-barreled  Emerson  Electrics  in  the  stern, 
and  two  20mm  Oerlikon  twin-barreled  guns  behind  the  bridge.  The 
Kirogi-class  patrol  boat,  with  a  range  of  700  kilometers  and  a  max- 
imum speed  of  38  knots,  was  well  suited  for  its  inshore  patrol 
mission. 

The  Mulgae-class  landing  ship,  another  naval  vessel  designed 
and  produced  in  the  United  States  by  Tacoma  Boatbuilding  Com- 
pany, was  ordered  by  the  navy  to  augment  a  small  amphibious 
fleet  that  comprised  several  models  of  obsolescent  transport  craft 
produced  in  the  United  States  during  World  War  II  and  trans- 
ferred to  the  South  Korean  navy  in  the  1960s  and  1970s.  The 
Mulgae-class  landing  ship  was  designed  to  carry  an  infantry  com- 
pany with  its  weapons,  mechanized  and  wheeled  vehicles,  and  other 
supplies.  It  had  a  range  of  560  kilometers  and  a  maximum  speed 
of  13  knots.  In  1986  South  Korea's  Kangnam  Shipbuilding  Cor- 
poration began  construction  of  the  Swallow/Chebi  class  minehunter, 
which  was  based  on  the  Italian-designed  Lerici-class.  At  that  time, 
the  South  Korean  navy  had  only  eight  United  States-produced 
Kunsan-class  minesweepers  in  service  with  the  three  fleets.  The 
Swallow-class  minehunter  had  new  types  of  sonar  and  mine  coun- 
termeasure  equipment  that  was  expected  to  improve  the  navy's 
capability  to  locate  and  to  eliminate  minefields  in  international  ship- 
ping lanes  during  wartime. 

In  the  late  1980s,  production  of  submarines  designed  by  the  Fed- 
eral Republic  of  Germany  (West  Germany)  was  initiated.  Three 
150-ton  submarines  designed  by  the  Howaldswerke  Shipbuilding 
Corporation  were  in  service  with  the  navy  in  1990.  Howaldswerke 
also  had  plans  to  provide  technical  assistance  for  the  construction 
of  three  Type  209  submarines,  about  1 ,400  tons  each.  South  Korean 
military  planners  were  interested  in  using  submarines  to  protect 
critical  shipping  lanes  from  North  Korean  submarines  in  wartime. 

Strategic  Planning  for  War 

Under  the  terms  of  the  1954  Republic  of  Korea-United  States 
of  America  Mutual  Defense  Treaty,  the  United  States  and  South 
Korea  agreed  to  cooperate  in  defending  the  security  and  strategic 
interests  of  both  countries.  South  Korea's  deployment  of  army  and 
marine  units  to  South  Vietnam  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  demon- 
strated its  commitment  to  meeting  its  obligations  under  the  treaty. 
By  1990  the  United  States  had  stationed  44,500  military  person- 
nel in  South  Korea — a  signal  to  North  Korea  and  other  countries 


297 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

in  the  region  that  Washington  would  meet  its  security  commitments 
to  Seoul  under  the  Mutual  Defense  Treaty. 

United  States  Forces  in  Korea 

In  the  confusion  of  the  early  days  of  the  Korean  War,  Seoul 
placed  its  armed  forces  under  the  command  of  General  Douglas 
A.  MacArthur  as  United  Nations  (UN)  commander.  This  arrange- 
ment continued  after  the  armistice.  For  some  twenty-five  years, 
the  United  Nations  Command  headquarters,  which  had  no  South 
Korean  officers  in  it,  was  responsible  for  the  defense  of  South  Korea, 
with  operational  control  over  a  majority  of  the  units  in  the  South 
Korean  military.  The  command  was  the  primary  peacetime  plan- 
ning organization  for  allied  response  to  a  North  Korean  invasion 
of  South  Korea  and  the  principal  wartime  command  organization 
for  all  South  Korean  and  United  States  forces  involved  in  defend- 
ing South  Korea.  In  1978  a  binational  headquarters,  the  South 
Korea-United  States  Combined  Forces  Command  (CFC),  was 
created,  and  the  South  Korean  military  units  with  front-line  mis- 
sions were  transferred  from  the  United  Nations  Command  to  the 
CFC's  operational  control.  The  commander  in  chief  of  the  CFC, 
a  United  States  military  officer,  answered  ultimately  to  the  national 
command  authorities  of  the  United  States  and  the  Republic  of 
Korea  (see  fig.  17). 

Historically,  operational  control  of  South  Korea's  tactical  armed 
forces  has  made  the  United  States  commander  vulnerable  to  the 
politics  of  association.  United  States  commanders  have  rigidly 
avoided  commentary  on  South  Korean  party  politics,  confining 
public  statements  to  purely  military  matters  on  such  issues  as  arms 
buildups  and  threats  from  North  Korea.  However,  in  the  complex 
politics  of  the  Korean  Peninsula,  the  United  States  commander's 
military  opinions  often  have  been  publicly  manipulated  as  support 
for  Seoul's  authoritarianism. 

In  May  1961  and  December  1979,  the  command  structure  was 
breached  by  South  Korean  troops  participating  in  military  coups. 
A  more  complex  set  of  circumstances  occurred  in  May  1980,  when 
troops  were  withdrawn  from  the  CFC  under  existing  procedures 
and  dispatched  to  Kwangju  to  respond  to  the  student  uprising.  Con- 
fusion in  the  South  Korean  public  over  the  particular  circumstances 
of  the  incident,  the  United  States  position,  and  the  limits  of  the 
CFC's  control  led  many  South  Koreans  to  believe  that  the  United 
States  fully  supported  the  violent  suppression  of  the  uprising.  The 
lack  of  an  accurate  historical  record  for  nearly  ten  years  gener- 
ated widespread  misunderstanding,  and  it  has  been  credited  with 


298 


National  Security 


the  rise  of  anti- Americanism  in  South  Korea,  a  movement  which 
continues. 

Only  after  President  Chun  stepped  down  at  the  end  of  1987, 
and  the  opposition  in  the  National  Assembly  grew  stronger,  did 
the  United  States  begin  answering  the  questions  concerning  Unit- 
ed States  involvement  in  Kwangju.  On  June  19,  1989,  Washing- 
ton issued  the  "United  States  Government  Statement  on  Events 
in  Kwangju,  Republic  of  Korea,  in  May  1980,"  in  response  to 
formal  requests  from  the  National  Assembly.  The  statement  ad- 
dressed a  series  of  questions  related  to  the  rise  to  power  of  then 
Lieutenant  General  Chun  Doo  Hwan.  The  statement  noted  no  prior 
knowledge  of  the  assassination  of  President  Park  Chung  Hee,  nor 
warning  of  the  December  12,  1979,  incident,  in  which  a  group  of 
South  Korean  army  officers  led  by  Major  General  Chun  seized 
control  of  the  military.  It  was  revealed  that  Washington  repeated- 
ly protested  to  the  government  and  the  military  leadership  about 
the  misuse  of  forces  under  the  Combined  Forces  Command.  The 
report  also  stated  that  South  Korean  authorities  gave  the  United 
States  two  hours  advanced  warning  of  the  extension  of  martial  law 
on  May  18,  1980,  and  no  prior  warning  of  the  military's  intention 
to  arrest  political  leaders  or  to  close  both  the  National  Assembly 
and  the  universities. 

The  statement  clearly  noted  that  none  of  the  South  Korean  forces 
deployed  at  Kwangju  were,  during  that  time,  under  either  the  oper- 
ational control  of  the  CFC  or  the  control  of  any  United  States 
authorities.  Additionally,  the  United  States  had  neither  prior 
knowledge  of  the  deployment  of  special  forces  to  Kwangju  nor 
responsibility  for  their  actions  there.  The  report  addressed  the  use 
of  the  Twentieth  Division,  CFC,  and  clarified  that  the  CFC  agree- 
ment allowed  both  the  United  States  and  South  Korea  to  assert 
control  over  its  forces  at  any  time  without  the  consent  of  the  other. 
According  to  the  statement,  the  United  States  was  informed  in  ad- 
vance of  intentions  to  use  elements  of  the  Twentieth  Division  to 
reenter  Kwangju,  that  United  States  officials,  after  cautioning 
against  the  use  of  military  force  to  solve  a  political  crisis,  accepted 
that  it  would  be  preferable  to  use  the  Twentieth  Division  rather 
than  Special  Forces  units  (but  the  latter  were  also  involved) .  The 
report  further  documented  that  the  United  States  repeatedly  pro- 
tested public  distortions  of  Washington's  actions  and  policy  by  Seoul 
and  the  South  Korean  press,  namely  allegations  that  the  United 
States  knew  either  of  the  December  12  incident  in  advance  or  of 
the  extension  of  martial  law,  or  that  Washington  approved  of  the 
Special  Forces  actions  in  Kwangju.

National  Security 


While  the  report  rebutted  most  of  the  myths  of  American  cul- 
pability for  events  in  1979  and  1980,  the  ten-year  delay  in  issuing 
the  report  did  little  to  resolve  the  misgivings  held  by  many  South 
Koreans,  who  still  persisted  in  believing  that  the  United  States  was 
in  some  way  a  party  to  the  military  takeover  in  May  1980,  and 
the  harsh  suppression  of  the  Kwangju  demonstrations  that  followed. 

In  1990  a  few  hundred  United  States  military  personnel  were 
assigned  to  the  United  Nations  Command  headquarters  in  P'an- 
munjom,  in  the  DMZ,  and  were  responsible  for  representing  the 
United  States  at  meetings  of  the  Military  Armistice  Commission. 
Because  the  Seoul  and  P'yongyang  governments  had  never  negotiat- 
ed a  peace  agreement  after  the  Korean  War,  the  sometimes  shaky 
1953  armistice  concluded  between  the  United  Nations  Command, 
North  Korea,  and  China  remained  the  only  formal  channel  for  han- 
dling complaints  about  violations  of  the  truce. 

There  were  32,000  United  States  Army  personnel  in  South  Korea 
in  1990;  most  were  assigned  to  the  Eighth  Army,  which  included 
the  Second  Infantry  Division,  the  Seventeenth  Aviation  Brigade, 
and  other  detachments  deployed  north  of  Seoul  as  part  of  the  joint 
South  Korean-United  States  forward  defense  strategy.  If  a  con- 
flict were  to  occur,  the  Second  Infantry  Division  would  be  expect- 
ed to  serve  as  a  reserve  force  for  the  South  Korean  army  on  one 
of  the  main  invasion  routes  between  the  DMZ  and  Seoul.  United 
States  Army  personnel  with  command  or  planning  responsibilities 
for  combat  units  also  were  assigned  to  the  headquarters  of  the  CFC 
and  to  the  headquarters  of  the  Republic  of  Korea-United  States 
Combined  Field  Army,  of  which  the  Second  Infantry  Division  was 
the  main  American  component.  The  remaining  United  States  Army 
personnel  were  assigned  to  support  the  missions  of  selected  Unit- 
ed States  and  South  Korean  combat  units,  serving  primarily  in  com- 
munications, logistics,  and  training  positions. 

There  were  12,000  United  States  Air  Force  personnel  in  South 
Korea  in  1990.  They  were  assigned  to  units  responsible  for  early 
warning,  air  interception,  close  air  support  of  United  States  and 
South  Korean  ground  forces,  combat  support,  aircraft  maintenance, 
and  the  transportation  of  personnel  and  supplies  from  the  United 
States,  Japan,  and  other  United  States  military  installations  in  the 
Pacific.  The  Seventh  Air  Force,  headquartered  at  Osan  Air  Base, 
was  the  command  element  for  all  United  States  Air  Force  organi- 
zations in  South  Korea.  United  States  Lockheed  U-2  high-altitude 
reconnaissance  and  South  Korean  Grumman  E-2C  early  warn- 
ing aircraft  patrolled  the  North  Korean  border  and  monitored  the 
Soviet  Union's  air  and  naval  activities  in  the  Sea  of  Japan  area.

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

Advanced  F-16  fighter  aircraft  were  used  by  tactical  fighter  squad- 
rons based  at  Osan  and  Kunsan.  These  squadrons  operated 
alongside  South  Korean  air  force  tactical  squadrons  in  both  air  in- 
terception and  close  air  support  roles.  South  Korea  and  the  United 
States  jointly  managed  the  South  Korean  tactical  air  control  sys- 
tem, which  had  wartime  responsibility  for  Korean  airspace  and  the 
entire  South  Korean  coastline.  The  United  States  Military  Airlift 
Command  was  responsible  for  transporting  United  States  military 
personnel,  weapons,  and  supplies  from  the  United  States  and  lo- 
cations in  the  Pacific  to  South  Korea. 

United  States  Navy  and  United  States  Marine  Corps  personnel 
in  South  Korea  consisted  of  about  500  officers  and  enlisted  per- 
sonnel who  occupied  critical  staff  and  liaison  positions  in  the  CFC. 
The  United  States  Pacific  Command  in  Hawaii  frequently  deployed 
units  of  the  United  States  Pacific  Fleet,  based  in  Japan,  and  units 
of  the  marine  corps,  based  in  Okinawa  and  other  locations  in  the 
Pacific,  to  South  Korea  for  joint  training  exercises,  particularly 
Team  Spirit,  held  every  spring  to  promote  South  Korean-United 
States  military  cooperation  and  readiness.  During  the  1988  Seoul 
Olympics,  the  United  States  Seventh  Fleet  operated  in  the  Sea  of 
Japan  and  was  assigned  specific  missions  to  assist  units  of  the  CFC 
in  discouraging  P'yongyang  from  attempting  to  disrupt  the  Olympic 
Games. 

South  Korean  and  United  States  Cooperation 

In  1968  the  United  States  and  South  Korea  held  their  first  an- 
nual Security  Consultative  Meeting.  This  meeting  provided  high- 
level  defense  experts  from  the  two  countries  with  an  official  forum 
for  reassessing  the  nature  of  the  North  Korean  threat  to  South 
Korea,  for  agreeing  on  an  overall  defense  strategy  for  South  Korea, 
and  for  outlining  the  roles  of  both  countries  in  deterring  a  North 
Korean  invasion. 

During  the  1989  Security  Consultative  Meeting  in  Washington 
(the  meetings  were  held  in  alternate  years  in  Seoul  and  Washing- 
ton), the  two  nations  agreed  that  the  Moscow-assisted  moderniza- 
tion of  Pyongyang's  air  force  and  army  indicated  that  the  military 
situation  in  Northeast  Asia  remained  tense  and  unpredictable. 
Soviet  leader  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev's  Korean  policy,  focused  on 
promoting  unofficial  contacts  with  Seoul  though  Moscow,  continued 
to  bolster  Pyongyang's  military  establishment. 

South  Korean  and  United  States  leaders  who  attended  the  1 989 
Security  Consultative  Meeting  considered  it  unlikely  that  the  Soviet 
Union  would  initiate  a  military  conflict  targeting  South  Korea.  They 
believed,  however,  that  increasing  Soviet  military  support  for  North 


302 


National  Security 


Korea  made  it  highly  probable  that  the  Soviet  Union  would  con- 
tinue to  assist  North  Korea  if  war  broke  out.  For  this  reason,  United 
States  secretary  of  defense  Richard  B.  Cheney  and  South  Korean 
minister  of  national  defense  Yi  Sang-hun  agreed  to  strengthen  stra- 
tegic planning  through  existing  organizations,  such  as  the  CFC. 

Internal  Security 

From  the  founding  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  its  leaders,  while 
professing  liberal  democratic  ideals,  consistentiy  held  that  the  secu- 
rity threat  posed  by  an  aggressive,  communist  North  Korea  re- 
quired some  modification  of  Western  democracy  to  fit  Korean 
realities.  Confronted  with  a  heavily  armed  enemy  determined  to 
reunify  the  peninsula  on  its  own  terms — by  force,  if  necessary — 
successive  South  Korean  governments  gave  top  priority  to  exter- 
nal and  internal  security,  guaranteed  by  large  and  well- organized 
security  services.  The  need  for  social  order  and  discipline  in  the 
face  of  this  threat  remained  central  to  the  government's  approach. 
Faced  with  a  divided  country,  even  "loyal"  opposition  often  was 
suppressed  as  dangerously  disruptive.  On  more  than  one  occasion, 
political  opposition  was  confused  with  communist  subversion.  The 
communist  threat  at  times  provided  political  justification  for 
authoritarian  regimes  to  maintain  power  and  to  suppress  public 
criticism  or  demands  for  democracy.  In  both  1961  and  1980,  the 
military  cited  these  concerns  to  justify  its  interventions  in  South 
Korean  politics. 

The  Threat  from  the  North 

After  the  division  of  the  peninsula,  North  Korea  used  subver- 
sion and  sabotage  against  South  Korea  as  part  of  its  effort  to  achieve 
reunification.  North  Korea  was  unsuccessful  at  developing  a  covert 
political  infrastructure  in  South  Korea  or  forging  links  with  dissi- 
dents resident  in  South  Korea,  and  after  the  early  1960s  Pyong- 
yang's efforts  were  unproductive.  Based  on  available  evidence,  in 
1990  it  appeared  that  P'yongyang  placed  or  recruited  only  a  limit- 
ed number  of  political  agents  and  sympathizers  in  the  southern  part 
of  the  peninsula.  Pyongyang's  agents  acted  individually  for  the 
most  part,  did  not  maintain  regular  contact  with  one  another,  and 
received  only  intermittent  support  and  guidance. 

Peacetime  infiltration  by  North  Korean  agents  was  a  fact  of  life 
in  South  Korea  after  the  armistice  in  1953.  There  were,  however, 
clear  shifts  both  in  the  number  and  method  of  infiltrations  over 
the  years  and  in  their  goals.  Through  the  mid-1960s,  P'yongyang 
sent  agents  primarily  to  gather  intelligence  and  to  try  to  build  a 
covert  political  apparatus.  This  tactic  was  followed  by  a  dramatic 


303 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

shift  to  violent  attempts  to  destabilize  South  Korea,  including  com- 
mando raids  along  the  DMZ  that  occasionally  escalated  into  fire- 
fights  involving  artillery.  These  raids  peaked  in  1968,  when  more 
than  600  infiltrations  were  reported,  including  an  unsuccessful  at- 
tempt at  a  commando  attack  on  the  Blue  House  in  Seoul  and  the 
infiltration  of  over  120  commandos  on  the  east  coast.  In  1969  more 
than  150  infiltrations  were  attempted,  involving  almost  400  agents. 
In  1970  and  1974,  agents  attempted  unsuccessfully  to  assassinate 
President  Park.  In  the  1974  attempt,  during  an  August  15  ceremony 
marking  National  Liberation  Day  at  the  National  Theater  in  Seoul, 
the  assassin's  shots  missed  President  Park  but  killed  Mrs.  Park. 
Subsequently,  Pyongyang's  infiltration  efforts  abated  somewhat, 
and  the  emphasis  shifted  back  to  intelligence  gathering  and  covert 
networks. 

From  the  mid-1970s  to  the  early  1980s,  most  North  Korean  in- 
filtration was  done  by  heavily  armed  reconnaissance  teams,  which 
increasingly  were  intercepted  and  neutralized  by  South  Korean 
security  forces.  After  shifting  to  infiltration  by  sea  for  a  brief  peri- 
od in  the  1980s,  P'yongyang  apparently  discarded  military  recon- 
naissance in  favor  of  inserting  agents  from  third  countries.  North 
Korea  did  not  abandon  violence,  however,  as  was  shown  by  the 
abortive  1982  attempt  to  recruit  Canadian  criminals  to  assassinate 
President  Chun  Doo  Hwan,  the  1983  Rangoon  assassination  at- 
tempt that  killed  seventeen  South  Korean  government  officials  and 
four  Burmese  dignitaries,  and  the  1987  destruction  of  a  Korean 
Air  airliner  with  115  people  on  board.  In  the  airliner  bombing, 
North  Korea  broke  from  its  pattern  of  targeting  South  Korean 
government  officials,  in  particular  the  president,  and  targeted  or- 
dinary citizens. 

North  Korean  propaganda  concentrated  on  weakening  the  so- 
cial fabric  and  sowing  discord  between  the  South  Korean  govern- 
ment and  the  population.  Indirectly,  North  Korea  sought  to  turn 
dissident  elements  within  South  Korean  society  into  propagandists 
and  agitators  who  would  undermine  the  government.  P'yongyang 
achieved  some  limited  indirect  success  in  this  effort,  as  indicated 
by  the  repetition  of  some  of  its  themes  by  student  dissidents.  North 
Korean  coverage  of  dissident  activity  in  the  south  was  on  occasion 
so  timely  and  accurate  as  to  lead  some  members  of  the  South  Korean 
government  to  believe  that  dissent  in  the  south  was  directed  from 
the  north.  However,  despite  similarities  between  North  Korean 
propaganda  and  dissident  statements,  South  Korean  security  agen- 
cies never  convincingly  established  a  direct  connection  between 
the  dissidents  and  the  north,  although  in  the  late  1980s  some  ele- 
ments among  dissident  groups  increasingly  used  Marxist-Leninist

language  and  North  Korean  political  themes  (see  Political  Extre- 
mism and  Political  Violence,  ch.  4). 

Seoul's  Response 

The  pre-Korean  War  period  was  marked  by  political  turmoil 
and  widespread  demands  for  sweeping  political,  economic,  and  so- 
cial change.  As  the  communists  entrenched  themselves  in  the  north 
and  right-of-center  politicians  emerged  in  control  in  the  south,  the 
possibility  for  peaceful  unification  of  the  peninsula  disappeared. 
In  the  autumn  of  1946,  a  series  of  unorchestrated  leftist-led  labor 
strikes  and  rural  peasant  rebellions  were  suppressed  by  the  fledg- 
ling Korean  National  Police  after  some  1,000  deaths  and  30,000 
arrests.  The  communist  South  Korean  Workers'  Party  led  a  part- 
ly indigenous  guerrilla  movement  in  the  south  after  a  major  rebel- 
lion on  Cheju  Island  in  April  1948  that  claimed  tens  of  thousands 
of  lives.  South  Korea's  military  and  paramilitary  forces  were  be- 
set by  mutinies  and  defections  but  eventually  gained  the  upper  hand. 
In  reaction  to  the  communist-based  Yosu-Sunch'on  rebellion  of  Oc- 
tober 1948,  a  harsh  national  security  law  was  passed  in  December 
1949  that  made  communism  a  crime.  However,  the  law  was  so  com- 
prehensive and  vague  that  it  could  be  used  against  any  opposition 
group.  Under  the  law,  members  of  the  South  Korean  Workers'

Party  were  arrested  and  some  150,000  persons  were  barred  from 
political  activity.  Guerrilla  warfare  continued  until  the  end  of  1949, 
coupled  with  skirmishing  along  the  thirty-eighth  parallel.  North 
Korea's  conventional  attack  followed  when  it  became  clear  that  the 
insurgents  would  not  triumph  easily. 

Recollection  of  this  chaotic  period  and  the  invasion  from  North 
Korea  colored  subsequent  South  Korean  government  attitudes 
toward  internal  security.  Domestic  opposition,  especially  from  the 
left,  was  suspect.  President  Syngman  Rhee's  call  for  national  uni- 
ty provided  political  justification  for  limiting  the  activities  of  the 
opposition  during  the  1950s.  Although  the  regime  did  not  suppress 
all  opposition  or  independent  sources  of  information,  it  suppressed 
some  organized  opposition  and  criticism  (see  The  Media,  ch.  4). 

In  the  late  1950s,  as  Rhee  became  more  authoritarian,  the  gov- 
ernment increasingly  resorted  to  using  the  police  force  and,  to  a 
lesser  extent,  the  military  security  forces,  for  political  purposes. 
The  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  whose  charter  ranged  from  intelli- 
gence and  investigative  operations  to  supervision  of  local  and 
provincial  affairs,  emerged  as  a  powerful  political  force.  The  police, 
with  a  strong  core  of  veterans  from  the  Japanese  colonial  police 
(approximately  70  percent  of  the  highest  ranking  officers,  40  per- 
cent of  the  inspectors,  and  15  percent  of  the  lieutenants),  was  both 
effective  and  feared.  The  police  used  strong-arm  tactics  to  coerce 
support  for  the  ruling  party  during  elections  and  harassed  the  po- 
litical opposition.  The  prerogative  of  the  police  to  call  in  anyone 
for  questioning  was  a  powerful  tool  of  intimidation.  These  circum- 
stances inevitably  led  to  police  corruption,  politicized  law  enforce- 
ment, and  exploitation  of  the  populace  in  the  name  of  internal 
security.  Rhee's  political  survival  became  more  and  more  depen- 
dent on  the  police.  When  police  control  wavered  at  the  time  of  the 
April  19  student  revolution  in  April  1960,  his  regime  fell. 

The  short-lived  Chang  Myon  government  (July  1960  to  May 
1961)  did  not  survive  long  enough  to  articulate  an  internal  security 
policy  but  was  committed  to  a  more  open  political  system.  However, 
because  of  internal  conflict  within  the  ruling  party  and  the  obstruc- 
tions of  the  conservative  opposition,  society  was  in  a  state  of  polit- 
ical and  social  turmoil. 

Following  the  May  16,  1961,  military  coup,  the  Korean  Cen- 
tral Intelligence  Agency  (KCIA)  was  formed  on  June  19.  Directly 
under  the  control  of  the  Supreme  Council  for  National  Reconstruc- 
tion, the  KCIA,  with  nearly  unlimited  power,  emerged  as  the  or- 
ganization most  feared  during  the  Park  Chung  Hee  era.  Under 
Kim  Chong-p'il's  direction,  the  organization  weeded  out  anti-Park 
elements  and  became  the  prime  tool  keeping  the  regime  in  power.

National  Security 


Under  Park,  the  lack  of  advancement  in  civil  liberties  continued 
to  be  justified  by  referring  to  the  threat  from  North  Korea.  The 
political  influence  of  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  and  the  police 
declined  in  the  face  of  the  KCIA's  power.  The  relationship  between 
the  police  and  general  public,  however,  was  not  significantly  al- 
tered. As  Se-Jin  Kim  wrote  in  1971:  "The  former  still  act  with 
arbitrary  arrogance;  the  latter  respond  with  fear  but  not  respect. ' ' 

The  government  often  used  martial  law  or  garrison  decree  in 
response  to  political  unrest.  From  1961  to  1979,  martial  law  or  a 
variant  was  evoked  eight  times.  The  October  15,  1971,  garrison 
decree,  for  example,  was  triggered  by  student  protests  and  result- 
ed in  the  arrest  of  almost  2,000  students.  A  year  later,  on  October 
17,  1972,  Park  proclaimed  martial  law,  disbanded  the  National 
Assembly,  and  placed  many  opposition  leaders  under  arrest  (see 
Constitution;  Human  Rights,  ch.  4).  In  November  the  yusin  con- 
stitution (yusin  means  revitalization),  which  greatly  increased 
presidential  power,  was  ratified  by  referendum  under  martial  law. 

The  government  grew  even  more  authoritarian,  governing  by 
presidential  emergency  decrees  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the 
establishment  of  the  yusin  constitution;  nine  emergency  decrees  were 
declared  between  January  1974  and  May  1975.  The  Park  regime 
strengthened  the  originally  draconian  National  Security  Act  of  1960 
and  added  an  even  more  prohibitive  Anticommunism  Law.  Un- 
der those  two  laws  and  Emergency  Measure  Number  Nine,  any 
kind  of  antigovernment  activity,  including  critical  speeches  and  writ- 
ings, was  open  to  interpretation  as  a  criminal  act  of  "sympathiz- 
ing with  communism  or  communists"  or  "aiding  antigovernment 
organizations."  Political  intimidation,  arbitrary  arrests,  preven- 
tive detention,  and  brutal  treatment  of  prisoners  were  not  un- 
common. 

Opposition  to  the  government  and  its  harsh  measures  increased 
as  the  economy  worsened  in  1979.  Scattered  labor  unrest  and  the 
government's  repressive  reactions  sparked  widespread  public  dis- 
sent: mass  resignation  of  the  opposition  membership  in  the  Na- 
tional Assembly  and  student  and  labor  riots  in  Pusan,  Masan,  and 
Ch'angwon.  The  government  declared  martial  law  in  the  cities. 
In  this  charged  atmosphere,  under  circumstances  that  appeared 
related  to  dissatisfaction  with  Park's  handling  of  the  unrest,  on  Oc- 
tober 26,  1979,  KCIA  chief  Kim  Chae-gyu  killed  Park  and  the 
chief  of  the  Presidential  Security  Force,  Ch'a  Chi-ch'ol,  and  then 
was  himself  arrested.  Emergency  martial  law  was  immediately 
declared  to  deal  with  the  crisis,  placing  the  head  of  the  Defense 
Security  Command,  Major  General  Chun  Doo  Hwan,  in  a  posi- 
tion of  considerable  military  and  political  power.

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 


Popular  demand  for  the  restoration  of  civil  liberties  after  Park's 
death  was  immediate  and  widespread.  Acting  President  Ch'oe  Kyu- 
ha  revoked  Emergency  Measure  Number  Nine,  which  had  forbid- 
den criticism  of  the  government  and  the  yusin  constitution.  Civil 
rights  were  restored  to  almost  700  people  convicted  under  the  emer- 
gency decrees.  The  illegitimacy  of  the  yusin  constitution  was  ac- 
knowledged, and  the  process  of  constitutional  revision  begun. 

The  slow  pace  of  reform  led  to  growing  popular  unrest.  In  early 
May  1980,  student  demonstrators  protested  a  variety  of  political 
and  social  issues,  including  the  government's  failure  to  lift  emer- 
gency martial  law  imposed  following  Park's  assassination.  The  stu- 
dent protests  spilled  into  the  streets,  reaching  their  peak  during 
May  13  to  16,  at  which  time  the  student  leaders  obtained  a  promise 
that  the  government  would  attempt  to  speed  up  reform.  The  mili- 
tary's response,  however,  was  political  intervention  led  by  Lieu- 
tenant General  Chun  Doo  Hwan,  then  KCIA  chief  and  army  chief 
of  staff.  Chun,  who  had  forced  the  resignation  of  Ch'oe' s  cabinet, 
banned  political  activities,  assemblies,  and  rallies,  and  arrested 
many  ruling  and  opposition  politicians. 

In  Kwangju,  demonstrations  to  protest  the  extension  of  martial 
law  and  the  arrest  of  Kim  Dae  Jung  turned  into  rebellion  as  demon- 
strators reacted  to  the  brutal  tactics  of  the  Special  Forces  sent  to 
the  city.  The  government  did  not  regain  control  of  the  city  for  nine 
days,  after  some  200  deaths. 

General  Chun  Doo  Hwan,  as  chairman  of  the  standing  com- 
mittee of  the  Special  Committee  for  National  Security  Measures 
(SCNSM),  assumed  de  facto  leadership  of  the  country.  The 
pronouncement  of  martial  law  announced  as  a  result  of  Park's  as- 
sassination remained  in  effect  until  January  24,  1981.  Under  the 
Special  Committee  for  National  Security  Measures  and  the  Legis- 
lative Council  for  National  Security  that  replaced  it,  sweeping  po- 
litical controls  were  instituted.  Established  political  parties  were 
disbanded  and  over  800  people  banned  from  politics;  the  media 
were  restructured,  many  journals  were  abolished,  and  hundreds 
of  journalists  were  purged;  some  8,000  employees  were  purged  from 
government  or  government-controlled  companies  and  some  37,000 
people  were  arrested  and  "re-educated"  in  military  training  camps 
under  the  Social  Purification  Campaign;  and  military  court  juris- 
diction was  extended  to  such  civilian  offenses  as  corruption  and 
participation  in  antigovernment  demonstrations.  The  new  National 
Assembly  Law  and  the  amended  National  Security  Act  (which  was 
rewritten  to  incorporate  elements  of  the  1961  Anticommunist  Law) 
also  were  passed.  On  January  10,  1981,  the  Martial  Law  Command

allowed  people  to  resume  limited  political  activities  in  preparation 
for  the  presidential  election. 

The  Fifth  Republic's  constitution  marked  significant  progress 
from  the yusin  constitution.  As  implemented  by  the  newly  elected 
Chun  government,  however,  it  fell  far  short  of  popular  expecta- 
tions of  democraticization  that  had  been  raised  after  Park's  death. 
The  constitution  was  attacked  by  students  and  dissidents  as  Park's 
yusin  system  under  new  trappings.  The  government  attempted  to 
defuse  discontent  by  "decompression"  as  well  as  repression,  gradu- 
ally returning  civil  rights  to  those  banned  in  1980.  Addition- 
ally, the  government  opened  up  the  political  system  slightly  in  1983 
and  to  a  greater  degree  in  1985,  although  the  dissident  movement 
continued. 

Discontent  was  kept  under  control  until  1987  by  the  regime's 
extensive  security  services — particularly  the  Agency  for  National 
Security  Planning  (ANSP,  the  renamed  KCIA),  the  Defense  Secu- 
rity Command  (DSC),  and  the  Combat  Police  of  the  Korean  Na- 
tional Police  (KNP).  Both  the  civilian  ANSP  and  the  military  DSC 
not  only  collected  domestic  intelligence  but  also  continued  "intel- 
ligence politics." 

The  Act  Concerning  Assembly  and  Demonstration  was  used  to 
limit  the  expression  of  political  opposition  by  prohibiting  assem- 
blies likely  to  "undermine"  public  order.  Advanced  police  notifi- 
cation of  all  demonstrations  was  required.  Violation  carried  a 
maximum  sentence  of  seven  years'  imprisonment  or  a  fine.  Most 
peaceful  nonpolitical  assemblies  took  place  without  government  in- 
terference. However,  the  act  was  the  most  frequently  used  tool  to 
control  political  activity  in  the  Fifth  Republic,  and  the  Chun  re- 
gime was  responsible  for  over  84  percent  of  the  6,701  investiga- 
tions pursued  under  the  act. 

The  security  presence  in  city  centers,  near  university  campuses, 
government  and  party  offices,  and  media  centers  was  heavy. 
Citizens,  particularly  students  and  young  people,  were  subject  to 
being  stopped,  questioned,  and  searched  without  due  process.  The 
typical  response  to  demonstrations  was  disruption  by  large  num- 
bers of  Combat  Police,  short-term  mass  detention  of  demonstra- 
tors, and  selective  prosecution  of  the  organizers.  Arrest  warrants — 
required  by  law — were  not  always  produced  at  the  time  of  arrest 
in  political  cases. 

The  National  Security  Act  increasingly  was  used  after  1985  to 
suppress  domestic  dissent.  Intended  to  restrict  "antistate  activi- 
ties endangering  the  safety  of  the  state  and  the  lives  and  freedom 
of  the  citizenry,"  the  act  also  was  used  to  control  and  punish  non- 
violent domestic  dissent.  Its  broad  definition  of  offenses  allowed 


310 


National  Security 


enforcement  over  the  widest  range,  wider  than  that  of  any  other 
politically  relevant  law  in  South  Korea.  Along  with  other  politically 
relevant  laws  such  as  the  Social  Safety  Act  and  the  Act  Concern- 
ing Crimes  Against  the  State,  it  weakened  or  removed  procedural 
protection  available  to  defendants  in  nonpolitical  cases. 

Questioning  by  the  security  services  often  involved  not  only  psy- 
chological or  physical  abuse,  but  also  outright  torture.  The  1987 
torture  and  death  of  Pak  Chong-ch'ol,  a  student  at  Seoul  Nation- 
al University  being  questioned  as  to  the  whereabouts  of  a  class- 
mate, played  a  decisive  role  in  galvanizing  public  opposition  to  the 
government's  repressive  tactics. 

The  security  services  not  only  detained  those  accused  of  violat- 
ing laws  governing  political  dissent,  but  also  put  under  various  lesser 
forms  of  detention — including  house  arrest — those  people,  including 
opposition  politicians,  who  they  thought  intended  to  violate  the  laws. 
Many  political,  religious,  and  other  dissidents  were  subjected  to 
surveillance  by  government  agents.  Opposition  assembly  members 
later  charged  in  the  National  Assembly  that  telephone  tapping  and 
the  interception  of  correspondence  were  prevalent.  Ruling  party 
assembly  members,  government  officials,  and  senior  military  offi- 
cials probably  also  were  subjected  to  this  interference  although  they 
did  not  openly  complain. 

Listening  to  North  Korean  radio  stations  remained  illegal  in  1990 
if  it  were  judged  to  be  for  the  purpose  of  "benefiting  the  antistate 
organization"  (North  Korea).  Similarly,  books  or  other  literature 
considered  subversive,  procommunist,  or  pro-North  Korean  were 
illegal;  authors,  publishers,  printers,  and  distributors  of  such  materi- 
al were  subject  to  arrest. 

Use  of  tear  gas  by  the  police  (over  260,000  tear  gas  shells  were 
used  in  1987  to  quell  demonstrations)  increasingly  was  criticized; 
the  criticism  eventually  resulted  in  legal  restrictions  on  tear  gas  use 
in  1989.  The  government  continued,  however,  to  block  many  "ille- 
gal" gatherings  organized  by  dissidents  that  were  judged  to  incite 
"social  unrest."  In  1988  government  statistics  noted  6,552  rallies 
involving  1.7  million  people.  There  were  2.2  million  people  who 
had  participated  in  6,791  demonstrations  in  1989. 

Intelligence  Agencies 

The  Agency  for  National  Security  Planning 

The  Agency  for  National  Security  Planning  (ANSP)  was  origi- 
nally established  on  June  19,  1961  as  the  Korean  Central  Intelli- 
gence Agency  (KCIA)  directly  under  the  Supreme  Council  for 


311 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

National  Reconstruction  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  May 
16,  1961,  military  coup.  Its  duties  were  to  "supervise  and  coor- 
dinate both  international  and  domestic  intelligence  activities  and 
criminal  investigation  by  all  government  intelligence  agencies,  in- 
cluding that  of  the  military. ' '  Its  mission  was  akin  to  that  of  a  com- 
bined United  States  Central  Intelligence  Agency  and  Federal 
Bureau  of  Investigation. 

The  first  head  of  the  KCIA  was  Kim  Chong-p'il.  Kim,  utiliz- 
ing the  existing  Army  Counterintelligence  Corps,  built  a  3,000- 
member  organization — the  most  powerful  intelligence  and  inves- 
tigatory agency  in  the  republic.  The  KCIA  maintained  a  com- 
plex set  of  interlocking  institutional  links  with  almost  all  of  the 
government's  key  decision-making  bodies.  The  KCIA  had  a  near- 
monopoly  over  crucial  information  concerning  national  security 
under  the  charter  of  the  Act  Concerning  Protection  of  Military 
Secrets  and,  more  importantly,  possessed  considerable  veto  pow- 
er over  other  agencies  through  its  supervisory  and  coordination 
functions. 

The  KCIA's  practically  unlimited  power  to  investigate  and  to 
detain  any  person  accused  of  antistate  behavior  severely  restricted 
the  right  to  dissent  or  to  criticize  the  regime.  The  frequent  ques- 
tioning, detention,  or  even  prosecution  of  dissidents,  opposition 
figures,  and  reporters  seriously  jeopardized  basic  freedoms  and 
created  an  atmosphere  of  political  repression. 

After  the  1979  assassination  of  President  Park  Chung  Hee  by 
the  KCIA  director,  the  KCIA  was  purged  and  temporarily  lost 
much  of  its  power.  Chun  Doo  Hwan  used  his  tenure  as  acting  direc- 
tor of  the  KCIA  from  April  to  July  1980  to  expand  his  power  base 
beyond  the  military.  The  organization  was  renamed  the  Agency 
for  National  Security  Planning,  and  its  powers  were  redefined  in 
presidential  orders  and  legislation.  The  ANSP,  like  its  predeces- 
sor, was  a  cabinet-level  agency  directly  accountable  to  the  presi- 
dent. The  director  of  the  ANSP  continued  to  have  direct  presidential 
access.  In  March  1981,  the  ANSP  was  redesignated  as  the  prin- 
cipal agency  for  collecting  and  processing  all  intelligence.  The  re- 
quirement for  all  other  agencies  with  intelligence- gathering  and 
analysis  functions  in  their  charters  to  coordinate  their  activities  with 
the  ANSP  was  reaffirmed. 

Legislation  passed  at  the  end  of  1981  further  redefined  the 
ANSP's  legally  mandated  functions  to  include  the  collection,  com- 
pilation, and  distribution  of  foreign  and  domestic  information 
regarding  public  safety  against  communists  and  plots  to  overthrow 
the  government.  The  maintenance  of  public  safety  with  regard  to 
documents,  materials,  facilities,  and  districts  designated  as  secrets

National  Security 


of  the  state  was  the  purview  of  the  ANSP,  as  was  the  investigation 
of  crimes  of  insurrection  and  foreign  aggression,  crimes  of  rebel- 
lion, aiding  and  abetting  the  enemy,  disclosure  of  military  secrets, 
and  crimes  provided  for  in  the  Act  Concerning  Protection  of  Mili- 
tary Secrets  and  the  National  Security  Act.  The  investigation  of 
crimes  related  to  duties  of  intelligence  personnel,  the  supervision 
of  information  collection,  and  the  compilation  and  distribution  of 
information  on  other  agencies'  activities  designed  to  maintain  public 
safety  also  were  undertaken  by  the  ANSP.  By  1983  the  ANSP  had 
rebounded  and  again  was  the  preeminent  foreign  and  domestic  in- 
telligence organization. 

As  of  1990,  the  organizational  structure  of  the  ANSP  was  con- 
sidered classified  by  Seoul,  although  earlier  organizational  infor- 
mation was  public  knowledge.  Despite  the  social  and  political 
changes  that  came  with  the  Sixth  Republic  (1987-  ),  the  ANSP 
apparendy  still  considered  the  support  and  maintenance  of  the  presi- 
dent in  power  to  be  one  of  its  most  important  roles.  In  April  1990, 
for  example,  ruling  Democratic  Liberal  Party  (DLP)  coleader  Kim 
Young  Sam  complained  that  he  and  members  of  his  faction  wi- 
thin the  DLP  had  been  subjected  to  "intelligence  maneuvering  in 
politics"  that  included  wiretapping,  surveillance,  and  financial  in- 
vestigations. 

Nevertheless,  the  ANSP's  domestic  powers  were  indeed  curtailed 
under  the  Sixth  Republic.  Prior  to  the  change,  the  ANSP  had  had 
free  access  to  all  government  offices  and  files.  The  ANSP,  Defense 
Security  Command,  Office  of  the  Prosecutor  General,  Korean  Na- 
tional Police,  and  the  Ministry  of  Justice  had  stationed  their  agents 
in  the  National  Assembly  to  collect  information  on  the  activities 
of  politicians.  In  May  1988,  however,  overt  ANSP  agents,  along 
with  agents  of  other  intelligence  agencies,  were  withdrawn  from 
the  National  Assembly  building.  The  ANSP's  budget  was  not  made 
public,  nor  apparently  was  it  made  available  in  any  useful  man- 
ner to  the  National  Assembly  in  closed  sessions.  In  July  1989,  pres- 
sured by  opposition  parties  and  public  opinion,  the  ANSP  was 
subjected  to  inspection  and  audit  by  the  National  Assembly  for  the 
first  time  in  eighteen  years.  The  ANSP  removed  its  agents  from 
the  chambers  of  the  Seoul  Criminal  Court  and  the  Supreme  Court 
in  1988. 

As  of  1990,  however,  the  ANSP  remained  deeply  involved  in 
domestic  politics  and  was  not  prepared  to  relinquish  the  power  to 
prevent  radical  South  Korean  ideas — much  less  North  Korean 
ideas — from  circulating  in  South  Korean  society.  Despite  an  agree- 
ment in  September  1989  by  the  chief  policymakers  of  the  ruling 
and  opposition  parties  to  strip  the  ANSP  of  its  power  to  investigate 


313 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

pro-North  Korean  activity  (a  crime  under  the  National  Security 
Act),  the  ANSP  continued  enforcing  this  aspect  of  the  law  rather 
than  limiting  itself  to  countering  internal  and  external  attempts  to 
overthrow  the  government.  The  ANSP  continued  to  pick  up  radi- 
cal student  and  dissident  leaders  for  questioning  without  expla- 
nation. 

In  another  move  to  limit  the  potential  for  the  ANSP  to  engage 
in  "intelligence  politics,"  the  ANSP  Information  Coordination 
Committee  was  disbanded  because  of  its  history  of  unduly  influenc- 
ing other  investigating  authorities,  such  as  the  Office  of  the  Prose- 
cutor General.  Additionally,  the  ANSP,  responding  to  widespread 
criticism  of  its  alleged  human  rights  violations,  set  up  a  "watch- 
dog' '  office  to  supervise  its  domestic  investigations  and  to  prevent 
agents  from  abusing  their  powers  while  interrogating  suspects. 

Aside  from  its  controversial  internal  security  mission,  the  ANSP 
also  was  known  for  its  foreign  intelligence  gathering  and  analysis 
and  for  its  investigation  of  offenses  involving  external  subversion 
and  military  secrets.  The  National  Unification  Board  and  the  ANSP 
(and  the  KCIA  before  it)  were  the  primary  sources  of  government 
analysis  and  policy  direction  for  South  Korea's  reunification  strategy 
and  contacts  with  North  Korea.  The  intelligence  service's  reputa- 
tion in  pursuing  counterespionage  cases  also  was  excellent. 

The  ANSP  monitored  visitors,  particularly  from  communist  and 
East  European  countries,  to  prevent  industrial  and  military  espi- 
onage. Following  the  diplomatic  successes  of  the  late  1980s — the 
establishment  of  diplomatic  relations  with  the  Soviet  Union  and 
the  countries  of  Eastern  Europe,  and  the  increased  informal  con- 
tacts with  China,  Mongolia,  and  Vietnam — this  mission  grew  in 
importance.  The  security  watch  list  contained  162  out  of  3,808 
visitors  from  communist  nations  in  1988  and  226  out  of  6,444 
visitors  in  1989. 

The  Defense  Security  Command 

It  was  Syngman  Rhee,  not  the  military,  who  initiated  the  polit- 
ical involvement  of  the  military  in  intelligence  activities.  The  turning 
point  came  in  1952  when  Rhee  proclaimed  martial  law — and  the 
presence  of  military  police  in  the  chamber  of  the  National  Assem- 
bly guaranteed  passage  of  the  constitutional  amendment  he  sought 
over  the  objections  of  a  recalcitrant  legislative  branch  and  still- 
independent  judicial  branch.  Throughout  Rhee's  administration, 
two  military  units — the  Joint  Military  Provost  Marshal  and  the 
army  Counterintelligence  Corps  (CIC) — engaged  in  extralegal  and 
violent  political  tactics,  apparently  not  excluding  the  outright  mur- 
der of  politically  undesirable  people.  Although  the  details  never 


314

were  disclosed  fully,  more  than  a  few  minor  political  figures'  dis- 
appearances were  connected  to  the  two  units. 

Under  Park,  the  provost  marshal's  political  role  declined,  while 
the  CIC  and  its  successor,  the  Army  Security  Command  (ASC), 
concentrated  on  internal  military  security.  The  CIC/ASC,  which 
was  under  Park's  direct  control,  maintained  strict  surveillance  over 
all  high-ranking  officers.  It  acted  as  a  deterrent  to  would-be  coup 
leaders.  It  tried,  less  successfully,  to  prevent  the  rise  of  disruptive 
factions  within  the  military. 

The  Defense  Security  Command  was  formally  activated  in  Oc- 
tober 1977.  This  merger  of  the  Army  Security  Command,  the  Navy 
Security  Unit,  and  the  Air  Force  Office  of  Special  Investigations 
produced  a  single,  integrated  unit  under  the  direct  command  and 
operational  control  of  the  minister  of  national  defense.  Although 
technically  subordinate  to  the  minister,  the  DSC  commander  oper- 
ated semiautonomously  and  typically  had  personal,  direct  access 
to  the  president.  Given  the  disparity  in  service  size,  the  old  ASC 
predominated  within  the  DSC.  The  strength  of  the  DSC  varied 
over  time  within  a  probable  range  of  5,000  to  7,000  people  during 
the  1980s. 

The  DSC  (and  its  predecessors)  was  created  to  deal  with  the  real 
question  of  loyalty  within  a  military  on  a  divided  peninsula.  It  was 


315 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

inspired  by  the  Guomindang  model,  in  which  political  officers  moni- 
tored the  military  services  for  subversion  or  disloyalty.  The  DSC 
was  responsible  for  monitoring  the  military  for  loyalty;  for 
safeguarding  military  information;  for  monitoring  domestic  polit- 
ical, economic,  and  social  activities  that  might  jeopardize  military 
capabilities  and  national  unity;  for  maintaining  defense  industrial 
security — both  physically  and  in  terms  of  counterespionage;  for 
countering  North  Korean  infiltration;  for  detecting  espionage  and 
anticommunist  law  violations;  and  for  conducting  special  investi- 
gations at  the  direction  of  the  president. 

The  DSC  assigned  small  elements  to  all  major  military  units  to 
monitor  security  and  loyalty.  These  elements  operated  outside  the 
unit's  chain  of  command  and  performed  a  highly  effective  indepen- 
dent audit  function.  The  DSC  representatives  never  rivaled  unit 
commanders  as  political  officers  occasionally  had  in  communist  mili- 
tary units.  Their  input  into  officer  evaluations,  however,  often 
played  a  decisive  role  in  career  progression,  giving  DSC  members 
influence  far  beyond  their  rank  and  producing  friction  between  them 
and  the  "regular"  military.  Corruption  within  the  DSC  was  difficult 
to  verify,  but  political  manipulations,  misappropriation  of  operat- 
ing funds,  and  undue  influencing  of  promotions  certainly  occurred 
and  were  particularly  rampant  in  the  mid-  to  late  1970s. 

For  most  of  the  Park  regime,  the  ASC/DSC  remained  concerned 
primarily  with  internal  military  matters  and  was  involved  in  the 
Yun  P'il-yong  incident  in  1972  and  removing  the  army  chief  of 
staff,  General  Yi  Se-ho,  in  1979  for  corruption.  Yun  P'il-yong, 
head  of  the  Capital  Garrison  Command,  was  court  martialed,  along 
with  several  close  followers,  on  charges  of  bribery  and  corruption. 
His  "real"  offense,  however,  was  creating  a  faction  among  the  class- 
es of  the  four-year  graduates  of  the  Korea  Military  Academy.  Yun's 
faction  did  not  disappear  when  he  was  purged.  The  group  of  young 
officers,  who  called  themselves  the  "Hanahoe"  (One  Mind  Soci- 
ety), had  its  origins  in  an  alumni  group,  the  Taegu  Seven  Stars, 
of  seven  young  officers,  including  Chun  Doo  Hwan  and  Roh  Tae 
Woo,  from  the  first  graduating  class  of  the  Academy  (Class  11). 
The  Hanahoe  evolved  into  a  group  of  some  200  members  through 
ten  graduating  classes.  In  1979  and  1980,  Chun  drew  on  the  Hana- 
hoe in  his  ascent  to  power.  The  irony  of  Park's  death  at  the  hands 
of  his  KCIA  chief  in  1979,  however,  was  compounded  by  the  rise 
to  power  of  the  commander  of  the  DSC,  then  Major  General  Chun 
Doo  Hwan,  who  used  the  military's  anticoup  apparatus  to  ensure 
the  success  of  his  own  coup  (see  The  Chun  Regime,  ch.  1). 

During  and  following  Chun's  rise  to  power,  the  DSC  greatly 
expanded  its  charter  into  domestic  politics  and  during  the  early 


316 


National  Security 


1980s  was,  perhaps,  the  dominant  domestic  intelligence  service. 
The  DSC  was  "credited"  with  masterminding  the  media  reorgani- 
zation of  1980  and  with  being  the  midwife  for  the  first  political  par- 
ties of  the  Fifth  Republic.  Many  former  DSC  members  played 
prominent  roles  in  Chun's  administration  and  in  the  ruling 
Democratic  Justice  Party. 

The  end  of  the  Fifth  Republic  brought  the  DSC  under  even  more 
pressure  than  had  been  brought  against  the  ANSP  to  cut  back  on 
its  domestic  political  activities.  Both  the  DSC  and  the  ANSP  with- 
drew from  the  National  Assembly  at  the  same  time  in  1988.  In 
October  1988,  Minister  of  National  Defense  O  Cha-bok  reported 
to  the  National  Assembly  that  the  DSC  would  concentrate  on  coun- 
terespionage activities,  preventing  the  spread  of  communism,  con- 
ducting "relevant  research,"  major  restructuring,  and  would 
discontinue  the  investigation  of  civilians.  Subsequently,  the  DSC 
eliminated  the  Office  of  Information  that  had  been  charged  with 
collecting  information  on  civilians,  whose  members  had  been  ac- 
tive in  local  government  offices.  As  a  result  of  this  move,  116  small 
detachments  were  disbanded,  and  the  DSC  announced  plans  to 
cut  860  personnel,  or  14  percent  of  its  1990  strength.  Additional- 
ly, the  DSC  curtailed  its  involvement  in  security  screening  of  non- 
military  government  personnel.  An  official  of  the  DSC  claimed  that 
surveillance  of  politicians  was  turned  over  to  "another  agency." 
Given  the  historically  broad  interpretation  of  national  security 
threats  espoused  by  DSC  personnel,  however,  many  analysts  doubt- 
ed that  the  DSC  had  totally  disengaged  from  domestic  political  sur- 
veillance. Despite  the  democratic  trends  of  the  late  1980s, 
intelligence  and  security  agencies  still  were  populated  by  individuals 
who  were  both  institutionally  and  personally  loyal  to  the  president 
and  ready  to  use  any  means  at  their  disposal  to  support  him. 

Korean  National  Police 

Organized  by  the  United  States  Army  Military  Government  in 
1945,  the  Korean  National  Police  (KNP)  force  was  formally  acti- 
vated in  1948  by  the  new  Korean  government  and  placed  under 
the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs.  Even  after  the  establishment  of  a 
separate  military  service  in  1948,  the  police  force  retained  a 
paramilitary  role  and  was  employed  in  military  operations  during 
the  Korean  War. 

Attacked  in  its  early  years  as  a  remnant  of  Japanese  colonial  rule 
(1910-45),  beset  by  low  professionalism,  factionalism,  endemic  cor- 
ruption, and  political  manipulation,  the  Korean  National  Police 
nonetheless  still  evolved  into  a  relatively  modern  and  effective  force. 
Although  the  police  force  was  used  by  the  Rhee  regime  in  such 


317 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

a  flagrantly  political  way  that  it  was  held  in  low  esteem  by  the 
citizenry,  reforms  made  after  the  1961  military  coup  began  the 
police  force's  slow  evolution  into  a  professional  force.  Reorgani- 
zation, recruitment  by  examination,  merit  promotion,  and  modern 
concepts  of  management  and  training  were  instituted.  Further  im- 
provements came  during  the  1970s  when  modern  communication, 
data  processing,  and  crime  detection  practices  were  introduced. 

In  1975  the  director  general  of  the  KNP  was  elevated  to  vice- 
ministerial  rank  directly  under  the  minister  of  home  affairs.  The 
KNP  reported  through  its  own  channels  to  its  headquarters  in  Seoul. 
Provincial  governors  and  local  officials  had  no  authority  over  the 
police. 

In  addition  to  the  regular  police  functions  of  law  enforcement, 
criminal  investigation,  and  public  safety,  the  KNP  was  responsi- 
ble for  riot  control,  countering  student  demonstrations,  and  other 
public  disorders.  Coastal  security,  including  patrolling  coastal 
waters,  antismuggling  operations,  and  coordinating  counterespi- 
onage operations  with  the  navy  and  the  air  force,  were  also  its  pur- 
view. "Combat  operations"  against  small-scale  North  Korean 
infiltration  attempts;  the  monitoring  of  foreign  residents  in  South 
Korea;  anticommunist  operations,  including  counterintelligence 
activities  and  monitoring  of  "security  risks"  (historically  expand- 
ed to  including  monitoring  political,  labor,  economic,  academic, 
religious,  and  cultural  figures);  and  counterterrorist  operations  were 
all  part  of  the  mission  of  the  KNP.  There  sometimes  was  competi- 
tive overlap  between  the  KNP,  ANSP,  and  the  DSC. 

In  1989  the  KNP  was  a  130,000-person  organization  that  con- 
sisted of  a  headquarters,  thirteen  metropolitan/provincial  police 
bureaus,  the  Combat  Police,  the  National  Maritime  Police,  an  an- 
titerrorist  unit,  the  Central  Police  Academy,  and  other  support  ser- 
vices, such  as  a  forensics  laboratory,  a  hospital,  and  other  police 
schools.  As  of  January  1989,  there  were  201  police  stations  and 
3,220  police  substations  and  detachments  throughout  the  country. 

The  National  Police  Headquarters  exercised  authority  over  all 
police  components.  Metropolitan  and  provincial  police  bureaus  were 
responsible  for  maintaining  public  order  by  directing  and  super- 
vising their  own  police  stations  (see  fig.  18). 

The  police  station  was  responsible  for  maintaining  public  peace 
within  its  own  precinct.  The  police  station  had  seven  functioning 
sections:  an  administration  and  public  safety  section,  responsible 
for  operation  and  supervision  of  police  substations  and  boxes,  liti- 
gation of  minor  offenses,  traffic  control,  and  crime  prevention;  a 
security  section,  responsible  for  maintaining  public  order;  an  in- 
vestigation section,  responsible  for  investigating  criminal  incidents, 


318 


National  Security 


lawsuits,  booking  criminals,  custody  of  suspects,  detention-cell 
management,  and  transference  of  cases  and  suspects  involved  in 
criminal  cases  to  prosecution  authorities;  a  criminal  section,  respon- 
sible for  crime  prevention;  a  counterespionage  section;  and  an  in- 
telligence section,  responsible  for  collection  of  intelligence  and 
information.  The  police  substation  or  police  box  took  preliminary 
actions  in  all  criminal  incidents,  civic  services,  and  accidents. 

Police  boxes  were  the  South  Korean  equivalent  of  the  cop  on 
the  beat.  They  provided  direct  contact  between  the  people  and  the 
police.  Police  box  personnel  were  supposed  to  know  their  areas  and 
the  people  who  lived  and  worked  in  them.  Police  boxes  were  com- 
manded by  lieutenants  or  sergeants  and  had  reaction  vehicles  avail- 
able on  a  twenty-four-hour  basis. 

Weighed  down  by  a  wide  range  of  administrative  duties,  KNP 
personnel  spent  only  1 5  percent  of  their  time  on  routine  enforce- 
ment duties  in  1989.  Among  other  things,  the  KNP  collected  fines, 
approved  death  certificates,  and  processed  security  checks  for  pass- 
port applicants.  The  personnel  shortage  was  acute;  official  statis- 
tics showed  that  there  was  only  one  police  officer  (excluding  the 
Combat  Police,  who  accounted  for  nearly  half  the  strength  of  the 
KNP)  for  every  680  South  Koreans,  as  compared  with  one  police 
officer  for  every  390  people  in  the  United  States,  one  for  every  318 
people  in  West  Germany,  and  one  for  every  551  people  in  Japan 
(the  lowest  ratio  for  any  major  industrialized  noncommunist  coun- 
try). This  shortage  was  compounded  by  a  tight  budget  and  the  con- 
tinued preoccupation  with  riot  control,  which  left  the  force  ill 
equipped  to  deal  with  the  demands  of  an  increasingly  affluent  and 
sophisticated  society. 

Recruitment  and  training  were  done  through  the  Central  Police 
Academy,  the  National  Police  College,  and  the  Police  Consolidat- 
ed Training  School.  The  Central  Police  Academy  was  established 
in  1987.  It  had  a  maximum  capacity  of  35,000  recruits  and  was 
capable  of  simultaneously  offering  a  six-week  training  course  for 
police  recruits,  a  two-week  training  course  for  draftees  of  the  Com- 
bat Police,  and  a  variety  of  basic  specialized  training  courses  for 
junior  police.  Officials  planned  to  recruit  about  10,000  new  police 
officers  a  year  from  1989  to  1991  to  alleviate  the  personnel  short- 
age, although  their  ability  to  maintain  the  quality  of  the  force,  given 
the  low  starting  pay,  was  questioned.  Only  12  percent  of  police 
applicants  were  university  graduates  in  1989.  Screening  unsuita- 
ble recruits  was  problematic  because  neither  psychiatric  nor  poly- 
graph assessments  were  administered.  (In  1982,  for  example,  an 
unstable  police  officer  killed  fifty-four  people  in  one  night  follow- 
ing a  domestic  dispute.)

National  Security 


By  1989  the  National  Police  College  had  graduated  some  500 
officers  since  its  first  class  graduated  in  1985.  Each  college  class 
had  about  120  police  cadets,  divided  between  law  and  public  ad- 
ministration specializations.  The  National  Police  College  began  ad- 
mitting women  in  1989;  five  women  were  admitted  each  year.  The 
cadets  shared  a  collective  life  for  four  years  at  the  college.  The  goal 
was  to  establish  a  career  officers  corps  similar  to  those  created  by 
the  military  academies. 

The  Police  Consolidated  Training  School  provided  advanced 
studies,  basic  training  for  junior  police  staff,  and  special  practical 
training  courses  for  security  and  investigative  officers  from  the  coun- 
terespionage echelons  of  police  agencies.  It  also  trained  Maritime 
Police  instructors,  key  command  personnel  for  the  Combat  Police 
force,  and  foreign-language  staff  members. 

Revolvers  and  carbines  were  the  customary  weapons;  billy  clubs 
were  carried  by  patrol  officers.  The  gradual  replacement  of  car- 
bines by  rifles  began  in  1981.  In  1989  the  KNP  reemphasized  the 
planned  replacement  of  carbines  with  M-16  rifles.  Approximate- 
ly 4,300  M-16s  were  to  be  supplied  to  police  boxes  and  stations 
in  1989;  by  1999  a  total  of  110,000  M-16s  was  scheduled  to  be 
distributed.  Transportation  was  by  motorcycle,  bicycle,  jeep,  truck, 
and  squad  car. 

The  KNP's  special  weapons  and  tactics  squad  was  known  as 
Force  868.  Organized  in  1982,  its  members  were  trained  in  martial 
arts  and  counterterrorist  tactics.  It  received  significant  support  and 
advice  from  United  States  and  West  European  counterterrorist  task 
forces  preceding  the  1988  Seoul  Olympics  and  was  well  supplied 
with  the  more  specialized  equipment  needed  for  combating  ter- 
rorism. 

The  Combat  Police  force  was  technically  subordinate  to  the 
Ministry  of  National  Defense,  but  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs 
and  the  Korean  National  Police  were  responsible  for  its  operational 
management  and  budget.  During  hostilities,  the  Combat  Police 
reverted  to  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense.  The  members  of  the 
Combat  Police  were  conscripted  at  age  twenty  or  older  and  served 
for  approximately  two-and-a-half  years.  Divided  into  companies, 
the  Combat  Police  force  was  assigned  to  the  metropolitan  police 
bureaus.  Except  for  supervisory  personnel  who  were  regular  KNP 
officers,  members  of  the  Combat  Police  were  paramilitary;  their 
primary  responsibilities  were  riot  control  and  counterinfiltration. 
Under  normal  conditions,  they  did  not  have  law  enforcement  pow- 
ers as  did  regular  KNP  officers.  In  1967  the  Combat  Police  force 
was  organized  to  handle  counterinfiltration  and  antiriot  duties.

South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

Approximately  half  of  the  total  strength  of  the  KNP  was  formed 
into  350  Combat  Police/riot  control  companies.  The  percentage 
of  Combat  Police  in  the  total  force  increased  during  the  1980s.  In 
1982  there  were  39,706  Combat  Police,  about  40  percent  of  the 
police  total.  By  1987  Combat  Police  represented  45.8  percent  of 
the  total  force  with  54,100  members.  Since  service  in  the  Combat 
Police  was  regarded  as  fulfilling  a  military  obligation,  young  men 
who  did  not  wish  to  serve  the  compulsory  minimum  thirty-month 
service  in  the  military  could  choose  instead  a  thirty-five-month  stint 
with  the  Korean  National  Police  as  combat  police.  Draftees  into 
military  service  also  could  be  assigned  to  the  Combat  Police  force 
after  completion  of  basic  training. 

Although  the  police  were  relatively  well  trained  and  disciplined, 
illegal  police  behavior  in  the  conduct  of  investigations  or  handling 
of  suspects  was  occasionally  a  serious  problem.  In  1985,  for  exam- 
ple, as  a  result  of  some  form  of  official  misconduct,  one-fourth  of 
Seoul's  detectives  were  transferred,  demoted,  or  otherwise  dis- 
ciplined. Rough  treatment  of  suspects  before  a  warrant  was  ob- 
tained was  a  continuing  problem.  Redress  in  cases  of  official 
misconduct  normally  was  handled  internally  and  rarely  resulted 
in  criminal  charges  against  police  officials. 

Historically,  the  use  of  excessive  force  by  the  police  was  perva- 
sive. In  violent  confrontations  with  student  demonstrators,  police 
units  generally  remained  well  disciplined,  but  rioters  were  beaten 
on  apprehension,  often  by  plainclothes  police.  Charges  of  police 
beatings  in  nonpolitical  cases  were  made  fairly  frequently  and  some- 
times were  reported  in  the  press.  Antigovernment  youth  activists 
were  subjected  to  repeated  and  severe  physical  torture,  which  at 
times  resulted  in  death  during  interrogations.  Various  degrees  of 
physical  maltreatment,  including  sleep  and  food  deprivation,  electric 
shocks,  beating,  and  forced  water  intake  were  common  during  police 
interrogations  under  the  Rhee,  Park,  and  Chun  regimes.  With  the 
founding  of  the  Sixth  Republic,  such  reports  declined.  However, 
according  to  the  United  States  Department  of  State's  reports  on 
human  rights,  some  credible  allegations  of  torture  were  made  during 
the  last  half  of  1989  by  persons  arrested  under  the  National  Secu- 
rity Act.  Credible  allegations  of  cruel  treatment  also  continued  in 
1990.  Although  political  cases  received  the  most  publicity,  mistreat- 
ment of  people  detained  or  arrested  for  nonpolitical  crimes  is  al- 
leged to  be  widespread. 

Criminal  Justice 

Throughout  Korea's  history,  the  assimilation  of  foreign  laws  has 
taken  place  in  waves.  Korea  assimilated  the  codes  of  the  Chinese

Qin,  Wei,  and  Tang  dynasties  in  the  early  Three  Kingdoms  peri- 
od, the  codes  of  the  Tang,  Song,  and  Yuan  dynasties  in  the  Koryo 
period  (918-1392),  the  Ming  Code  in  the  Choson  Dynasty 
(1392-1910)  period,  Western  civil  law  at  the  close  of  the  Choson 
Dynasty  and  during  the  Japanese  occupation,  and  both  Continental 
Law  and  Anglo-American  law  after  liberation  in  1945.  The  Cho- 
son Dynasty  also  produced  numerous  codifications  of  Korean  law 
and  created  new  laws  as  necessary  to  deal  with  economic,  social, 
and  other  public  policy  issues.  Confucian  values  exerted  strong  in- 
fluence on  Korea's  traditional  law. 

With  the  end  of  the  Choson  Dynasty  in  1910,  decisive  changes 
occurred  in  Korean  law.  Traditional  Korean  institutions  were  sud- 
denly replaced.  Reform  measures,  characterized  by  the  introduc- 
tion of  Western  institutions,  began  with  the  Kabo  Reforms 
(1894-95)  forced  on  Korea  by  Japan  and  modeled  on  the  Japanese 
reforms  of  the  Meiji  Restoration  (1868).  These  hasty  reforms 
produced  many  laws  translated  from  Japanese  codes,  which  in  turn 
had  their  origins  in  Roman  and  Germanic  laws.  The  imposition 
of  institutions  by  the  Japanese  and  their  post- 19 10  use  for  repres- 
sive colonial  control  constituted  a  sharp  break  with  the  Korean  past. 

The  Westernized  legal  system's  key  features  included  its  origin 
in  the  European  civil  law  tradition;  prominent  roles  for  legal  scholars, 


323 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

university  professors,  and  legislators,  rather  than  judges;  codified 
law  rather  than  precedent  as  the  major  source  of  law;  and  an  in- 
quisitorial rather  than  adversarial  court  procedure.  In  other  respects, 
however,  Japanese  colonial  rule  continued  several  features  of  the 
traditional  Korean  legal  order.  Under  Japanese  colonial  rule,  for 
example,  there  was  no  constitutional  law,  no  guarantee  of  rights, 
and  no  judicial  review  of  the  exercise  of  political  power.  The  legal 
system  of  Korea  under  Japanese  rule  was  composed  essentially  of 
rules,  duties,  and  obligations.  Further,  there  was  little  institution- 
al or  procedural  separation  of  powers.  The  Japanese  governor 
general  had  even  greater  executive  and  legislative  power  than  tradi- 
tional Korean  kings  and  ruled  through  a  large,  efficient,  and  modern 
bureaucracy. 

After  independence,  revulsion  over  the  Japanese  occupation  moti- 
vated Korean  officials  to  devise  a  new  codification  designed  to 
replace  all  Japanese  laws,  decrees,  and  orders,  as  well  as  the  regu- 
lations and  decrees  of  the  United  States  Army  Military  Govern- 
ment in  Korea  (1945-48)  with  Korean  codes.  The  process  took  ten 
years.  Eventually,  the  Criminal  Code  (1953),  the  Code  of  Crimi- 
nal Procedure  (1954),  the  Civil  Code  (1958),  the  Civil  Procedure 
Law  (1960),  and  the  Commercial  Code  (1962),  as  well  as  other 
codes — deliberately  distinguished  from  previous  Japanese  codes — 
were  adopted.  In  most  substantive  areas,  however,  South  Korean 
law  retained  the  most  fundamental  principles  and  procedures  of 
continental  jurisprudence  as  originally  received  through  Japan. 

The  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  (1954)  governed  most  aspects 
of  the  enforcement  of  criminal  justice.  The  code  retained  the  basic 
characteristics  of  the  European  continental  legal  system  and  had 
some  features  of  Anglo-American  law.  Among  the  features  adapt- 
ed from  the  United  States  legal  system  were  a  requirement  for 
judicial  warrants;  modification  of  preliminary  examination; 
strengthening  of  the  system  of  state-appointed  counsel;  rejection 
of  hearsay  evidence  as  a  matter  of  rule;  and  a  requirement  for  cor- 
roborating evidence  obtained  in  confessions. 

The  first  exclusionary  ruling  on  a  confession  in  a  South  Korean 
court  based  on  the  constitutional  guarantee  of  the  right  to  legal 
counsel  occurred  in  late  1989.  Law  enforcement  and  security  agency 
officials,  however,  did  not  consider  themselves  compelled  to  ad- 
here to  legal  precedents  or  court  rulings  when  subsequently  inves- 
tigating other  cases.  Police  and  prosecutors,  especially  in  political 
or  espionage  cases,  still  limited  the  frequency  and  length  of  defen- 
dants' meetings  with  counsel,  except  when  taking  written  state- 
ments. Legislative  action  was  needed  for  the  South  Korean  system

to  proceed  beyond  court  redress  of  specific  violations  in  specific 
cases  to  the  establishment  of  general  guidelines. 

Crime 

During  the  late  1980s,  South  Korea  experienced  a  jump  in  its 
traditionally  low  rates  of  violent  crime.  A  growing  number  of  vio- 
lent crimes  were  directed  against  women,  a  fact  that  drew  special 
public  concern. 

The  Korean  National  Police  authorities  denied  that  there  was 
any  "organized  crime"  in  South  Korea,  although  police  boxes  in 
Seoul  in  1990  posted  signs  encouraging  citizens  to  report  any  in- 
formation concerning  p'ongnyokpae,  violent  bands  of  men  armed  with 
knives  and  improvised  weapons  who  contributed  to  the  rise  in  vio- 
lent assaults  throughout  the  city.  Although  there  were  some  ties 
between  Japan's  underworld — the  yakuza  (Japanese  gangsters) — 
and  South  Korean  criminal  groups  through  ethnic  Koreans  resid- 
ing in  Japan,  yakuza  "bosses"  did  not  direct  the  extension  of yakuza 
activities  into  South  Korea.  Nevertheless,  the  disturbing  increase 
in  violent  crime  and  apparent  disputes  between  criminal  groups 
suggested  that  if  organized  crime  did  not  yet  exist  in  South  Korea 
in  1989,  its  precursors  were  evident. 

Historically,  narcotics  abuse  in  South  Korea  had  been  very  low; 
it  was  confined  primarily  to  marginal  urban  low-income  groups 
and  did  not  include  either  heroin  or  cocaine  abuse  (see  Health  Con- 
ditions, ch.  2).  In  the  late  1980s,  narcotics  abuse  remained  low 
but  had  steadily  increased,  becoming  a  social  and  political  issue. 
In  reaction  to  this  increase,  enforcement  responsibility  was  trans- 
ferred from  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Social  Affairs  to  the  Nar- 
cotics Division  of  the  Supreme  Prosecution  Administration  under 
the  Ministry  of  Justice.  This  action  gave  narcotics  enforcement  a 
higher  priority,  more  staffing,  and  more  funding.  (Drug-related 
arrests  had  increased  from  810  in  1985  to  1,227  in  1987  and  to 
1,606  in  1988.)  Most  drug-related  criminal  activity  involved  the 
manufacture  or  abuse  of  methamphetamine  and  South  Korea's 
emergence  as  a  major  Asian  producer  of  hirropon,  an  illicit  metham- 
phetamine. A  related  problem  was  transshipment  of  Asian  heroin 
destined  for  the  United  States  and  other  world  markets. 

Criminal  Procedure 

In  the  absence  of  martial  law  or  emergency  decrees,  both  of  which 
historically  had  been  exercised  by  the  government  and  provisions 
for  which  remained  in  the  1987  Constitution,  criminal  procedure 
in  other  than  political  cases  followed  a  set  format.  Both  public  prose- 
cutors and  the  police  were  authorized  to  conduct  investigations  of 


325 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

criminal  acts.  Public  prosecutors  were  under  the  direction  and  su- 
pervision of  the  Office  of  the  Supreme  Prosecutor  General;  the 
supreme  prosecutor  general  was  appointed  by  the  president.  In  1990 
there  were  four  branches  of  the  Office  of  the  High  Prosecutor  Gener- 
al and  fourteen  district  offices.  Theoretically,  police  authority  to 
investigate  criminal  acts  was  subordinate  to  the  direction  and  review 
of  the  prosecutors.  Also,  the  arrest  of  a  suspect  required  a  judicial 
warrant  except  in  cases  of  flagrante  delicto  or  when  it  was  believed 
that  the  suspect  would  flee  or  commit  the  act  again.  The  request 
for  a  warrant  could  be  made  only  by  the  prosecutor. 

After  an  arrest,  the  suspect  had  to  be  transferred  to  the  public 
prosecutor  within  ten  days  and  indicted  within  ten  days  of  the  prose- 
cutor's  gaining  custody.  The  judge  was  permitted  to  extend  de- 
tention another  ten  days;  the  suspect  could  request  court  review 
of  the  legality  of  detention. 

The  public  prosecutor  initiated  legal  action.  The  name  of  the 
accused,  the  alleged  crime,  the  alleged  facts  of  the  case,  and  the 
applicable  laws  were  stated  in  the  indictment.  The  prosecutor  had 
significant  discretionary  power  to  decide  whether  or  not  to  bring 
the  case  to  court  based  on  his  interpretation  of  the  law  and  evi- 
dence, or  in  consideration  of  a  suspect's  age,  character,  motive, 
or  other  circumstances,  even  though  a  crime  had  been  committed. 

Prosecutors  normally  indicted  only  when  they  accumulated  what 
they  considered  overwhelming  evidence  of  a  suspect's  guilt.  The 
courts,  historically,  were  predisposed  to  accept  the  allegations  of 
fact  in  an  indictment.  This  predisposition  was  reflected  in  both  the 
low  acquittal  rate — less  than  0.5  percent — in  criminal  cases  and 
in  the  frequent  verbatim  repetition  of  the  indictment  as  the  judg- 
ment. The  principle  of  "  innocent  until  proven  guilty"  applied  in 
practice  much  more  to  the  pre-indictment  investigation  than  to  the 
actual  trial. 

During  the  1980s,  there  was  a  dispute  within  the  legal  system 
over  the  judiciary's  power  to  check  prosecution.  The  prosecution 
and  judiciary  differed  over  whether  or  not  the  law  gave  the  judiciary 
grounds  to  arraign  suspects  before  issuing  warrants.  The  judiciary 
tried  repeatedly  in  the  1980s  to  institutionalize  this  right  and  in 
1989  asserted  it  in  a  proceeding.  The  judiciary  was  riot  able  to  com- 
pel the  prosecution  to  accept  this  view,  however. 

At  the  prosecutor's  discretion,  a  case  could  be  brought  before  the 
court  by  summary  indictment  if  the  offense  were  punishable  by 
fines.  In  such  a  case,  the  judge  gave  a  summary  judgment  without 
holding  a  public  hearing.  The  accused  could  request  an  ordinary  trial. 

Once  indicted,  the  accused  had  the  right  to  be  released  on  bail. 
Exceptions  could  be  made  if  the  offense  were  punishable  by  death, 


326

life  imprisonment,  or  imprisonment  over  ten  years;  if  the  defen- 
dant were  a  recidivist;  if  there  were  suspicion  that  the  defendant 
would  destroy  evidence;  or  if  there  were  reasonable  grounds  to  sus- 
pect that  the  defendant  would  flee;  or  if  the  residence  of  the  defen- 
dant were  unknown.  In  1989  bail  was  granted  in  a  National  Security 
Act  case  for  the  first  time. 

The  constitutional  right  to  representation  by  an  attorney  was 
not  interpreted  as  applying  to  the  investigation  and  interrogation 
phases.  In  National  Security  Act  cases,  access  to  counsel  was  regu- 
larly denied  during  the  investigation  phase.  In  1989  lawyers  sought 
court  orders  granting  access,  but  neither  the  ANSP  nor  the  Prose- 
cutor General's  Office  felt  compelled  to  comply  when  the  Nation- 
al Security  Act  was  involved. 

There  was  no  jury  system.  Cases  that  involved  offenses  punish- 
able by  the  death  penalty,  life  imprisonment,  or  imprisonment  for 
not  less  than  one  year  were  tried  by  three  judges  of  a  district  or 
branch  court.  The  remaining  cases  were  heard  by  a  single  judge. 
Political  and  criminal  cases  were  tried  by  the  same  courts;  mili- 
tary courts  did  not  try  civilians  except  under  martial  law. 

At  least  five  days  before  trial,  the  defendant  was  served  a  copy 
of  the  indictment.  The  defendant  had  to  be  represented  by  coun- 
sel if  the  offenses  were  punishable  by  death  or  imprisonment  for 


327 


South  Korea:  A  Country  Study 

more  than  three  years.  The  court  appointed  defense  counsel  if  the 
defendant  was  unable  to  do  so  because  of  age,  mental  capacity, 
poverty,  or  other  handicaps  that  might  impair  choice  or  commu- 
nication. 

Hearings  generally  were  open  to  the  public.  If  danger  to  national 
security  or  prejudice  to  public  peace  or  good  morals  were  involved, 
the  judge  could  close  the  proceedings.  Charges  against  defendants 
in  the  courts  were  declared  publicly.  Trial  documents,  however, 
were  not  part  of  the  public  record.  In  lengthy  and  complex  indict- 
ments, the  relationship  between  specific  alleged  actions  and  viola- 
tions of  specific  sections  of  the  penal  code  could  become  unclear. 
In  cases  involving  a  mixture  of  political  and  criminal  charges,  this 
situation  at  times  led  to  charges  of  unfair  proceedings.  A  defen- 
dant had  the  right  to  remain  silent  and  free  from  physical  restraint 
in  the  courtroom.  Judges  generally  allowed  considerable  scope  for 
the  examination  of  witnesses. 

Either  the  defendant  or  the  prosecutor  could  appeal  a  judgment 
on  the  basis  of  law  or  fact.  Appeals  could  result  in  reduced  or  in- 
creased sentences.  A  Constitution  Court  was  established  in  1988 
to  relieve  the  burden  on  the  Supreme  Court  (see  The  Judiciary, 
ch.  4).  When  the  constitutionality  of  a  law  was  at  issue  in  a  trial, 
the  Supreme  Court  requested  a  decision  of  the  Constitution  Court. 
The  president,  chief  justice,  and  the  National  Assembly  each  named 
three  members  of  the  nine-member  Constitution  Court. 

The  Supreme  Court  retained  the  power  to  make  final  review 
of  the  constitutionality  or  legality  of  administrative  decrees,  regu- 
lations, or  actions  when  at  issue  in  a  trial.  Grounds  for  an  appeal 
to  the  Supreme  Court  were  limited  by  the  Code  of  Criminal  Proce- 
dure to  violation  of  the  Constitution,  law,  or  regulation  material 
to  the  judgment;  abolition,  alteration,  or  pardon  of  penalty;  a  grave 
mistake  in  factfinding;  or  extreme  impropriety  in  sentencing.  An 
interpretation  of  law  in  an  appeal  had  binding  effect  on  the  inferi- 
or court  only  when  the  case  was  remanded.  In  other  cases,  however, 
a  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  only  had  persuasive  effect. 

Judges  were  trained  professionally  and  were  among  the  best 
products  of  one  of  the  toughest  education  systems  in  the  world. 
The  qualifications  for  a  judge  were  the  completion  of  two  years 
of  courses  at  the  Judicial  Research  and  Training  Institute  after  pass- 
ing the  national  judicial  examination,  or  the  possession  of  qualifi- 
cations as  a  prosecutor  or  an  attorney.  Judges  were  members  of 
a  tiny  elite;  the  institute  had  only  3,692  graduates  from  1949  to 
1988.  In  1988  there  were  only  940  judges,  668  prosecutors,  and 
1,593  practicing  attorneys.  There  were  additional  requirements  for 
higher  positions:  fifteen  years  of  legal  experience  for  the  chief  justice 


328 


National  Security 


and  justices  of  the  Supreme  Court;  ten  years  of  experience  for  the 
chief  judge  of  an  appellate  court,  the  chief  judge  of  a  district  court, 
the  chief  judge  of  a  family  court,  and  the  senior  judge  of  an  appel- 
late court;  and  five  years  of  experience  for  the  judge  of  an  appel- 
late court,  the  senior  judge  of  a  district  court,  and  the  senior  judge 
of  a  family  court.  South  Korea's  president,  with  the  consent  of  the 
National  Assembly,  appointed  both  the  chief  justice  and,  upon  the 
recommendation  of  the  chief  justice,  the  other  justices  of  the 
Supreme  Court.  Under  the  1987  Constitution  and  the  Court  Or- 
ganization Law,  lower  justices  were  appointed  by  the  chief  justice 
with  the  consent  of  the  Conference  of  Supreme  Court  Justices. 

Historically,  the  executive  branch  exercised  great  influence  on 
judicial  decisions.  However,  there  were  some  indications  of  in- 
creased judicial  independence  in  1989.  In  a  number  of  cases,  the 
Constitution  Court  found  that  the  government  had  violated  the 
constitutional  rights  of  individuals.  Moreover,  the  Supreme  Court 
invalidated  the  results  of  the  elections  for  two  National  Assembly 
seats,  citing  election  law  violations  by  victorious  ruling  party  can- 
didates. 

Penal  administration  was  controlled  and  supervised  by  the  Minis- 
try of  Justice.  There  were  four  detention  facilities  (for  unconvict- 
ed detainees),  twenty-seven  correctional  institutions,  ten  juvenile 
training  institutes,  and  four  juvenile  classification  homes.  Condi- 
tions in  correctional  institutions  were  austere  and  particularly  harsh 
in  winter.  Discipline  was  strict.  Prisoners  who  broke  rules  or  pro- 
tested conditions  sometimes  were  physically  abused.  Under  nor- 
mal circumstances,  however,  convicts  were  not  physically  punished. 
Most  accusations  of  mistreatment  involved  persons  detained  or 
awaiting  trial  in  detention  facilities,  rather  than  those  who  were 
already  convicted  and  serving  their  sentences  in  prison.  Visitation 
was  strictly  limited  to  legal  counsel  and  immediate  families.  Mail 
was  subject  to  monitoring  and  occasional  censorship.  There  was 
no  significant  difference  in  the  treatment  of  prisoners  on  the  basis 
of  wealth,  social  class,  race,  or  sex.  The  treatment  of  political 
prisoners  could  be  better  or  worse  than  that  of  regular  prisoners. 
On  some  occasions,  special  provisions  were  allowed  for  political 
prisoners,  and  as  late  as  1989  it  also  was  alleged  by  human  rights 
activists  that  political  prisoners  sometimes  were  subjected  to  sleep 
deprivation  and  psychological  pressure. 

There  were  a  number  of  probationary  devices  that  permitted 
police  to  supervise  suspected  or  convicted  criminals,  including  defer- 
ral of  prosecution  and  suspension  of  sentence.  These  measures  in- 
creased judicial  flexibility  and  were  often  used  to  show  clemency. 
Probationary  devices  also  had  frequently  been  used  to  ensure  that

released  political  offenders  behaved  in  a  manner  acceptable  to  the 
government.  Criminals  who  showed  repentance  regularly  were  freed 
in  amnesties,  often  linked  to  holidays.  Amnesty  often  was  declared 
to  showcase  the  beneficence  of  the  state  in  forgiving  criminals.

Three  excellent  sources  on  the  South  Korean  armed  forces  are 
Edward  A.  Olsen's  "The  Societal  Role  of  the  Republic  of  Korea 
Armed  Forces"  in  The  Armed  Forces  in  Contemporary  Asian  Societies; 
Eugene  Kim's  "The  South  Korean  Military  and  Its  Political  Role" 
in  Political  Changes  in  South  Korea;  and  Young  Woo  Lee's  insightful 
article  "Birth  of  the  Korean  Army,  1945-50"  in  Korea  and  World 
Affairs.  The  Asian  Defence  Journal  often  has  comparative  analyses 
of  the  military  capabilities  of  the  North  Korean  and  South  Korean 
armed  forces.  Larry  A.  Niksch's  "The  Military  Balance  on  the 
Korean  Peninsula"  in  Korea  and  World  Affairs  and  Richard  L.  Snei- 
der's  The  Political  and  Social  Capabilities  of  North  and  South  Korea  for 
the  Long-  Term  Military  Competition  provide  useful  information  on  the 
Korean  arms  race.  Dae-Kyu  Yoon's  Law  and  Political  Authority  in 
Korea  is  an  excellent  and  detailed  study  of  the  interaction  of  law 
and  politics  in  South  Korea.  Two  books  by  South  Korean  army 
officers,  Colonel  Lee  Suk  Bok's  The  Impact  of  United  States  Forces 
in  Korea  and  Brigadier  General  Taek-Hyung  Rhee's  U.S.-ROK 
Combined  Operations  provide  the  South  Korean  perspective  on  United 
States-South  Korean  military  relations.  English-language  sources 
on  national  security  issues  are  published  regularly  by  the  Seoul 
government,  South  Korean  universities,  and  two  daily  newspapers, 
Korea  Herald  and  Korea  Times.  The  Ministry  of  National  Defense 
publishes  an  annual  White  Paper  that  provides  a  comprehensive  ex- 
amination of  military  organization,  defense  spending,  and  train- 
ing in  the  South  Korean  armed  forces.  The  National  Police 
Headquarters  annually  publishes  Korean  National  Police,  a  pictorial 
and  textual  description  of  that  organization.  Manwoo  Lee,  Ronald 
D.  McLaurin,  and  Chung-in  Moon's  (eds.),  Alliance  under  Tension: 
The  Evolution  of  South  Korean- U.S.  Relations  is  another  useful  source. 

The  subversive  activities  of  North  Korea  in  South  Korea  and 
abroad  and  the  causes  for  increased  domestic  violence  in  South 
Korea  in  the  1980s  are  discussed  in  official  reports  published  by 
the  United  States  Department  of  State  and  the  Committee  on  For- 
eign Affairs  of  the  United  States  House  of  Representatives.  The 
Bombing  of  Korean  Airlines  Flight  KAL-858,  by  the  United  States 
House  Committee  on  Foreign  Relations,  provides  a  comprehen- 
sive examination  of  North  Korea's  past  use  of  and  capabilities  for

future  acts  of  terrorism  targeting  South  Koreans.  Donald  N.  Clark's 
The  Kwangju  Uprising  examines  aspects  of  the  Kwangju  incident 
following  Chun  Doo  Hwan's  December  1979  coup.  Selig  S.  Har- 
rison's The  South  Korean  Political  Crisis  and  American  Policy  Options 
discusses  the  goals  of  radical  organizations  in  South  Korea  in  the 
mid-1980s.  For  information  concerning  the  history  of  the  Korean

Year  Developments 


1972   President  Park  Chung  Hee  dismisses  nine  Supreme  Court 

justices  who  had  overturned  a  law  denying  relatives  of  war 
veterans  right  to  claim  compensation  from  state.  Park's  1972 
yusin  constitution  rescinds  Supreme  Court's  power  to  review 
constitutionality  of  laws. 

1980   .  Six  Supreme  Court  justices  are  interrogated  by  security  agency 

and  subsequendy  forced  to  step  down  for  their  minority  views 
that  Kim  Chae-gyu,  President  Park's  assassin,  had  not  con- 
spired to  overthrow  government. 

Early  1980s   A  number  of  law  students  are  blacklisted  from  enrolling  in  Ju- 
dicial Training  and  Research  Institute  after  demonstrating 
against  1980  Chun  Doo  Hwan  coup  d'etat. 

1985   Two  Seoul  District  Court  judges  are  punitively  reassigned  to 

provincial  posts  after  acquitting  accused  student  demonstra- 
tors. A  third  judge  is  transferred  after  protesting  the  reas- 
signment. 


Supreme  Court  reverses  its  earlier  decision  in  appeal  case  of 
Kang  Chong-gon,  a  National  Security  Act  offender  under  con- 
tinued detention  after  his  original  sentence  had  expired. 

1986   Justice  Yi  Il-kyu  is  denied  reappointment  to  Supreme  Court. 

Among  his  independent  decisions  are  a  1963  determination 
that  voided  coerced  confession  made  by  suspect  on  spying 
charges  and  questioning  jurisdiction  of  1980  military  court 
in  1985  appeal  by  lawyer  linked  with  opposition  figure  Kim 
Dae  Jung.

ier terms  than  those  of  conventional  IBRD  loans.  The  IFC, 
founded  in  1956,  supplements  the  activities  of  the  IBRD

had  passed  the  civil  service  examinations  even  though  they  had
