FOREWORD 


Australia’s eleventh national census was taken on 30 June 1986. An 
important aspect of the census is that it can be used to examine the 
characteristics of people living in different geographic settings such 
as the local suburban areas, cities or, the focus of this report, the 
rural areas of Australia. 


The ABS defines rural areas in accordance with international 
definitions. They do not include the many middle sized towns 
providing focal points for the economic and cultural life of people 
living in the surrounding areas. It should also be noted that in a 
country the size of Australia with its diverse climatic and physical 
environments, the characteristics of the rural population vary 
considerably from one region to another. In a report of this size it is 
not possible to examine the extent of this diversity. Despite this, there 
are basic differences between lifestyles in rural and urban areas and 
it is with these differences that this report is largely concerned. 


The report is divided into three main sections. The first examines the 
growth, distribution and demographic characteristics (including 
birthplace and religion) of the people living in rural areas. The second 
section examines their educational and work experiences and their 
incomes, and highlights some of the major changes that have 
occurred between 1976 and 1986. The third section examines the 
living arrangements of people in rural areas; the types of households 
and families most commonly found, the types of dwellings most 
commonly occupied and some information on housing costs.

DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS 


People who were counted in the 1986 Census were classified as 
living in rural or urban areas on the basis of the number of people 
living in the settlement, town or city in which they lived. 


People who lived in small towns which had a population of between 
200 and 999 people were classified as living in rural localities (holiday 
resorts were treated differently - see rural locality in the Glossary). An 
example is the town of Berrima in NSW, at the 1986 Census its 
population numbered 645 people so it was considered to be a rural 
locality. Population centres with more than 99,999 people were 
classified as major urban centres and included all the State capital 
cities except Darwin. Smaller centres with populations greater than 
999 people were classified as other urban centres. 


People who could not be classified as living in major urban centres, 
other urban centres or rural localities were classified as living in other 
rural areas. Although some people who lived in other rural areas did 
have remote or isolated homes, the classification does not imply 
remoteness. 


Throughout this report the term rural areas represents the 
combination of rural localities and other rural areas. Urban areas are 
the combination of major urban and other urban centres. 


At the 1986 Census, 2.3 million people were counted in rural areas. 
This represented 15 per cent of all people counted in Australia, a 
proportion which is low compared to most other countries. Australia has 
long been recognised as having a highly urbanised society and, 
although differences in the definition of rural areas restrict international 
comparison, information from other developed countries with similar 
definitions confirm this. For example, in 1986 the proportion of 
Canada's people living in rural areas was 23 per cent (see UN 
Demography Yearbook, 1989). 


Following World War || and the implementation of soldier resettlement 
schemes there was a slight increase in the rural population. 
Subsequently, the proportion of Australia’s population which resided 
in rural areas declined considerably, from 21 per cent in 1954 to 14 
per cent in the 1970s. In 1971-76 there was a slight resurgence in 
the population growth rate of rural areas. This gained strength in 
1976-86 when rural growth averaged 1.9 per cent a year compared 
to average urban growth of 1.3 per cent a year. The growth in rural 
areas was the result not only of natural increase (the difference 
between the number of births and deaths), but also of an increasing 
number of people moving from urban to rural areas. Such movers 
included commuters settling on the outer fringes of major cities and city 
people, particularly retirees, moving to coastal localities. For more 
information see Population Growth and Distribution in Australia (Cat. 
No. 2504.0).

Three in four rural Australians lived in New South Wales (29 per 
cent), Queensland (24 per cent) or Victoria (22 per cent), reflecting 
these States’ large regions amenable to agricultural development. In 
comparison to the urban population, rural people were highly 
represented in Queensland, Tasmania and the Northern Territory 
(over 20 per cent of the State/Territory population). About 12 per cent 
of people in New South Wales and Victoria lived in rural areas. The 
Australian Capital Territory had virtually no rural population. 


Queensland experienced the greatest growth in rural population 
between 1976 and 1986, increasing by 35 per cent. In the Northern 
Territory the increase was 34 per cent and in New South Wales, 22 
per cent. Contrary to the national trend, the proportion of population 
living in rural areas declined in Western Australia, the Northern 
Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.

... Close to capital cities 


.. small towns in remote areas 


More men than women 


People living in rural areas were heavily concentrated near major 
capital cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth) although large 
numbers could also be found along the eastern seaboard of Australia, 
from southern New South Wales to far north Queensland. Regions 
with harsh climatic conditions, such as western Queensland and New 
South Wales, the Pilbara, the Kimberley and south-east Western 
Australia, had the smallest rural populations. 


At the 1986 Census 423,000 people in Australia lived in rural 
localities, representing 19 per cent of the total rural population. 
Typically, people in remote rural areas (such as north Queensland, 
the Northern Territory and the Pilbara) were more likely to have lived 
in rural localities than people in rural areas living close to capital 
cities. Exceptions to this pattern were the hinterlands of Adelaide and 
Perth which both had high proportions of people in rural areas 
counted in rural localities. 


Historically, men have outnumbered women by substantial margins in 
rural areas. For example, a ratio of 121 men for every 100 women 
was recorded at the 1954 Census. However, the proportion of men 
has steadily declined and in 1986 the ratio was 110 men per 100 
women in rural areas Compared to 97 men per 100 women in urban 
areas. During the same period there were improvements in the 
standard of living in rural areas, changes in the role of women in the 
labour force, and decreasing reliance on labour ensuing from 
increased mechanisation.

A younger age profile 


.. few young adults and older 
people 


On average, the population in rural areas was slightly younger than 
the population in urban areas with a median age of 30.5 years 
compared to 31.3 years. There were high proportions of children 
(aged 0-16 years) and ‘middle aged’ adults (aged 30-55 years), 
indicators of a relatively high proportion of ‘traditional’ families in rural 
areas (see Section 3).

There were also marked differences in the number of younger adults 
in rural and urban areas. People in their late teens and early twenties 
(the ages typically associated with leaving school and entering the 
labour force), were under-represented in rural areas. The situation 
was more evident in the number of rural women, with the ratio of 
males to females being substantially higher in the age group 15-24 
years than for any other age group, and for the same age group in 
urban areas. The low numbers may indicate that many younger rural 
people move to urban areas in order to pursue work and further 
education opportunities. The under-representation of young women 
may also be attributable to the types of occupations available in rural 
areas and the high unemployment levels among them. As with 
younger people, migration to urban areas may explain the 
under-representation of elderly people in rural areas. For example, 
the proportion of people aged 75 years and over in rural areas was 
approximately half that of those in urban areas.

Across all adult age groups, for both men and women, rural areas 
had a greater representation of married people with a total of 61 per 
cent of rural men and 67 per cent of rural women being married, 
compared to 58 per cent of urban men and 56 per cent of urban 
women. Younger adults in rural areas were more likely to be married 
than their urban counterparts. Forty-three per cent of rural women 
and 17 per cent of rural men aged 20-24 years were married compared 
to 32 per cent of women and 15 per cent of men in urban areas.

In contrast to the high representation of married people in rural areas, 
there was low representation of divorced, separated and widowed 
people, especially women. This suggests a tendency for people 
(especially women) whose marriages have ended to migrate to urban 
areas. It is also possible that the stability of marriage in rural areas 
is such that family dissolution is less common. The low representation 
of widows is consistent with the low numbers of elderly people.

Rural women tended to have had more children than those in urban 
areas. Allowing for differences in the age composition of women in 
rural and urban areas, the average number of children ever born to 
women in rural areas was 25 per cent higher than for women in 
major urban centres. A comparison of the number of births for women 
in each age group revealed a similar pattern.

The differences in age, sex and marital status between the rural and 
urban populations are indicative of a variety of factors operating over 
a long period of time. They include migration, levels of fertility and 
montality and rates of marriage and marriage dissolution. Although it 
is difficult to isolate the importance of any one of these factors, the 
high numbers of married people with children and the low numbers 
of people, particularly women, who were separated or divorced recorded 
in rural areas further indicate a more traditional society in rural areas. 


There were 228,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people 
counted in the 1986 Census, and 76,000 (33 per cent) lived in rural 
areas. This was considerably higher than the proportion of the total 
population (15 per cent) living in rural areas. Aboriginal people 
represented 3 per cent of the total Australian rural population and 56 per 
cent of the rural population of the Northern Territory. For more detailed 
information on the Aboriginal population in rural areas see Australia's 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander People (Cat. No. 2503.3).

Few migrants 


.. Mainly English speaking 


Although overseas migration has played a crucial role in Australia’s 
population growth and in shaping its cultural life, the impact in rural 
areas has been less marked. In 1986 more than 1 in 5 people in 
Australia had been born overseas, but in rural areas the proportion 
was only a little more than 1 in 10. New migrants tend to settle in 
urban areas; only 1 in 20 of those who had arrived between 1981 
and 1986 were counted in rural areas.

The largest group of migrants in rural Australia came from English 
speaking countries, particularly the UK and Ireland and New Zealand. 
Compared to their proportion of the total overseas-born population 
(44 per cent), people born in English speaking countries were highly 
represented in rural areas (59 per cent). Among non-English 
speaking countries, people from Germany and the Netherlands were 
also more highly represented in rural areas than might have been 
expected from their representation in the total overseas-born 
population. 


.. higher proportion of women 
in recent years 


Mainly Christians 


The sex ratio of the overseas-born population in rural areas (113 men 
to 100 women) was higher than that of the total overseas-born 
population (105 men to 100 women). However, of the migrants who 
arrived in Australia between 1981 and 1986, men were outnumbered 
by women (97 to 100) and of those who settled in rural areas, there 
were 93 men for every 100 women. Among the larger groups of 
recent migrants counted in rural areas the highest proportion of 
women occurred among people born in the Philippines. Although the 
number of recent Filipino migrants counted in rural areas was small 
(1,299) there was a ratio of 6 women to 1 Filipino man.

About 73 per cent of both rural and urban people reported their 
religion at the 1986 Census as Christian. The most common 
denomination in rural areas was Anglican (26 per cent) followed by 
Catholic (21 per cent). This relative order was the reverse of that in 
urban areas where 27 per cent quoted Catholic and 24 per cent 
quoted Anglican. People reporting non-Christian religions accounted 
for less than 1 per cent of rural people but over 2 per cent of urban 
people. A slightly higher proportion of rural than urban people did not 
answer the optional religion question.

EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT AND 
INCOME 


Many factors can affect the number of years a person spends at 
school and their participation in post-school education. For people 
living in remote rural areas, long distances and small populations 
pose particular problems. For example, many children of families in 
rural areas attend boarding schools in the cities and most institutions 
of higher learning are located in larger towns and cities. These 
factors may require students from rural areas to move to urban areas. 
Following completion of their studies it is also possible that many 
students would not return to rural areas where opportunities to utilise 
specialised skills are limited. 


People living in rural areas had left school at an earlier age than 
urban dwellers. Among those living in rural localities in 1986, 81 per 
cent had left schoo! when aged 16 years or younger, compared to 75 
per cent in other rural areas and 71 per cent in urban areas. Since 
1981, however, younger people in both rural and urban areas have 
been staying at school longer. Between 1981 and 1986 the proportion 
of people in rural areas who had left school when aged 17 years or 
older increased from 20 per cent to 24 per cent and in urban areas 
the proportion increased from 25 per cent to 29 per cent. In rural 
areas in 1986, women were slightly more likely than men to have 
stayed at school until they were at least 17 years of age while the 
reverse was true in urban areas.

The proportion of men in rural areas with post-school qualifications 
was less than that of men in urban areas. In comparison, there was 
little difference between women in rural and urban areas with similar 
proportions having post-school qualifications. 


In rural areas, there were more women with diplomas (5 per cent) 
than with degrees (3 per cent) or trade certificates (2 per cent). As 
with urban men, rural men with trade certificates far outnumbered 
those with other qualifications.

Children in rural areas accounted for 17 per cent of pre-school and 
infant/primary school students and 16 per cent of secondary school 
students. Children in rural areas were less likely to have been 
attending non-government schools than children in urban areas with 
non-government schools accounting for 16 per cent of rural primary 
school students compared to 25 per cent in urban areas. 
Corresponding figures for secondary school students were 23 per 
cent in rural areas and 31 per cent in urban areas. Rural students 
who attended boarding schools located in urban areas would have 
been counted as part of the urban population on census night.

The proportion of tertiary students who lived in rural areas was low, 
reflecting the low number of tertiary institutions, particularly 
universities, located in rural areas. Students in rural areas accounted 
for 11 per cent of students undertaking courses at TAFE Colleges 
and Colleges of Advanced Education and 6 per cent of students 
undertaking courses at University. 


In 1986, there were over 1 million people in the labour force in rural 
areas, representing 15 per cent of Australia's total labour force. 
Between 1976 and 1986 the labour force in rural areas increased at 
a much faster rate than the urban labour force with an average 
growth rate of 1.9 per cent a year compared to 1.7 per cent in urban 
areas. Although the growth of the labour force slowed in both areas 
between 1981 and 1986, rural areas still had slightly higher annual 
rates (1.6 per cent) than urban areas (1.4 per cent).

.. and high labour force 
participation 


... but low growth in women’s 
labour force participation 


14 


Men and women aged 15 years and over were more likely to have 
been in the labour force if they lived in rural areas than if they lived 
in urban centres. This difference is attributable in part to the different 
age structures in rural and urban areas. For example, youth (aged 
15-24 years) and the elderly (aged 65 years or more), who generally 
had low labour force participation rates, were both under-represented 
in rural areas. On the other hand, Aboriginal people, another group 
with low labour force participation rates, were over-represented in 
rural areas. In the prime working ages of 25-54 years the labour force 
participation rates of men in rural and urban areas were similar. 


A major factor in the growth of the Australian labour force has been 
the increased participation of women, but it is in the urban areas 
rather than the rural areas that this increase has occurred. Between 
1976 and 1986 the labour force participation rate of women in rural 
areas, already high in 1976 at 49 per cent, increased by only one 
percentage point. In urban areas it increased by 4 percentage points 
(43 per cent to 47 per cent). Over the same period, the labour force 
participation rate of men declined, particularly in urban areas.

Young women (aged 15-34 years) in rural areas recorded lower 
labour force participation rates than young women in urban areas; 
perhaps reflecting both fewer job opportunities available to young 
women in rural areas (evidenced by the higher levels of 
unemployment) and a greater likelihood of women in rural areas to 
start families at earlier ages. Like older men in rural areas, older 
women in rural areas had participation rates substantially higher than 
their urban counterparts. 


Through the late 1970s and early 1980s employment growth in both 
rural and urban areas did not keep pace with the overall growth in 
the labour force. This was most pronounced between 1981 and 1986 
when the number of employed people in urban areas increased by 
less than 4 per cent, half the increase in the size of the urban labour 
force. In rural areas the increase in employment was even lower, 
especially in rural localities where there was an employment growth 
of 1 per cent compared to the 9 per cent increase in the size of the 
rural labour force. The difference between the increase in the size of 
the labour force and in total employment resulted in high rates of 
unemployment, especially in rural localities. 


The economic base of rural areas differs considerably between 
regions and localities but, generally, can be characterised as having 
substantial numbers employed in agriculture and support service 
industries. In 1986, 294,000 people (34 per cent of employed men 
and 27 per cent of employed women) in rural areas were employed 
in the agriculture, forestry, hunting and fishing industries. Of these, 
95 per cent were employed in agriculture with the next largest 
sub-division, forestry and logging, accounting for only 2 per cent of 
workers. Employment in agriculture was more significant in other rural 
areas (35 per cent) than in rural localities (10 per cent) where 
employment in community services, predominantly in the fields of 
health and education (18 per cent), and wholesale/retail trade (17 per 
cent), was high.

Despite an increase in the total number of people employed in rural 
areas over the last decade, employment in agriculture, in both 
absolute and relative terms, has fallen. The number of people 
employed in agriculture declined by almost 34,000 between 1976 and 
1981 and a further 16,700 between 1981 and 1986. The proportion 
of people in rural areas employed in agriculture declined from 42 per 
cent in 1976, to 34 per cent in 1981 and to 31 per cent in 1986. The 
decline in agricultural employment in the five years between 1981 
and 1986 was more than offset by the growth in community services 
and wholesale/retail trade (additional employment of 31,000 and 
24,500 respectively). Rapid employment growth also occurred in 
finance, property and business services and recreation and personal 
services where the numbers of employed people increased by 39 per 
cent and 30 per cent respectively. 


Although employment numbers declined, the importance of the 
agricultural sector as a source of employment for men and women in 
rural areas, especially those designated as other rural areas, was 
confirmed by their occupations. Thirty per cent of men and 25 per 
cent of women in these areas were classified as farmers and farm 
managers.

An obvious difference between rural and urban areas is the range of 
available employment opportunities. In other rural areas the most 
common occupation for both men and women was farmer or farm 
manager, accounting for 30 per cent of employed men and 25 per 
cent of employed women. In rural localities occupations were more 
diverse with the five largest groups accounting for 28 per cent of men 
and 37 per cent of women.

There were marked regional differences in employment growth between 
the States and Territories. At the 1986 Census the largest decline in 
numbers of people employed in agriculture since 1981 had occurred in 
the rural areas of Victoria (8,600) and New South Wales (5,500). The 
Northern Territory and Queensland both recorded smail increases in the 
number of people employed in agriculture. Despite having the greatest 
employment decline in agriculture, Victoria followed Queensland and 
Tasmania as a State with a high increase in overall employment in rural 
areas.

High unemployment among

18 


The level of rural unemployment varied between each State and 
Territory but, overall, the pattern was compatible with the levels of 
unemployment recorded in urban areas. An exception was the 
Northern Territory with the highest level of rural unemployment 
recorded in the country (18 per cent) compared to 10 per cent 
unemployment in its urban areas. 


At the 1986 Census, levels of unemployment were higher in rural 
areas than in urban areas with women in rural areas just as likely to 
have been unemployed as men. As in urban areas, the highest levels 
of unemployment were recorded among the younger members of the 
labour force, particularly younger women. For example, the 
unemployment rate for women aged 15-19 years in rural areas was 
25 per cent, substantially higher than that recorded for either men in 
rural areas or people in urban areas of the same age group (all 20 
per cent).

In 1986, the annual income of individuals and households in rural 
areas was lower than in urban areas. The median annual income of 
rural men was $11,900, substantially less than that of men in urban 
areas ($15,500). Although the differences between women were less 
pronounced, women in rural areas also had lower incomes than their 
urban counterparts. The median income of rural households was 
similarly lower than that of urban households ($19,000 and $22,000 
respectively). Although 13 per cent of Australian households were in 
rural areas, 15 per cent of households in the lowest income group 
and 10 per cent in the highest group were in rural areas.

Men in rural localities had slightly higher median incomes than men 
in other rural areas ($12,400 and $11,800 a year respectively). This 
difference may be attributable to the influence of the incomes of 
farmers who were highly represented in other rural areas (men who 
were farmers or farm managers had a median income of $10,000, 
much lower than the median income of ail rural men). Conversely, 
women and households in rural localities had lower incomes than 
those in other rural areas. Women farmers had a median income 
($7,400 a year) well above that of rural women in general.

LIVING ARRANGEMENTS AND HOUSING 


In 1986, there were 5.3 million households in Australia, of which 
nearly 700,000 were found in rural areas. Over 80 per cent of rural 
households contained families, compared to 76 per cent of urban 
households. Households containing one family only were more 
prevalent in rural areas than in urban areas but there were also 
proportionally more households containing more than one family. 
Lone person households and group households were less common 
in rural areas. The distribution of household types in rural localities 
was very similar to that in urban areas (78 per cent were family 
households compared to 76 per cent in urban areas). Almost 85 per 
cent of households in other rural areas contained families.

Families differ considerably in their composition according to the 
presence or absence of a mother, father, children and/or other family 
members. The representation of different family types in rural and 
urban areas confirmed that the ‘traditional’ family unit of a couple and 
dependent child(ren) was more prevalent in rural areas. For example, 
of the 601,000 families in rural areas, 41 per cent consisted of a 
couple and their dependent child(ren). The equivalent proportion in 
urban areas was 35 per cent. One parent families represented 6 per 
cent of families in rural areas compared to 8 per cent in urban areas. 
Overall, the proportions of other family types, such as couple only 
families or couple families with adult family members, in rural and 
urban areas, were not very dissimilar. The distribution of family types 
further suggested that ‘traditional’ families were more common in 
other rural areas than in rural localities with 52 per cent of families in 
other rural areas containing at least a couple and dependent 
child(ren) compared to 45 per cent in rural localities.

The prevalence of the ‘traditional’ family unit in rural areas was 
further demonstrated by the fact that families in these areas generally 
had more children (29 per cent of families with dependent children 
had 3 or more dependent children living in the household) than 
families in urban areas (23 per cent), and that there were fewer 
couples involved in de facto relationships (5 per cent compared to 6 
per cent). There was also a particularly high proportion of one parent 
families headed by a male parent in rural areas (21 per cent 
compared to 13 per cent).

Although the average size of both rural and urban households has 
deciined over the years, rural households were still larger than urban 
households in 1986 with an average of 3.2 people compared to 2.8 
people. In rural areas, 20 per cent of households contained more 
than 4 people and 14 per cent contained 1 person only. In urban 
areas the figures were reversed with 20 per cent of households 
containing only 1 person and 14 per cent containing more than 4 
people. For more details see Australian Families and Households 
(Cat. No. 2504.0).

People in rural areas were more likely to have lived in a separate 
house than people in urban areas. More than 9 in 10 occupied 
private dwellings in rural areas were separate houses while in urban 
areas the proportion was slightly less than 8 in 10. Of the remaining 
private dwellings found in urban areas, the majority were flats, 
town-houses and other types of medium and high density housing. In 
rural areas, a substantial proportion of the occupied private dwellings 
(7 per cent) were caravans etc. in caravan parks or on residential 
land, and various forms of improvised housing.

Home ownership, an aspiration held by many Australians, had been 
realised by 38 per cent of households by 1986. !n rural areas 48 per 
cent of private dwellings were owned outright and 26 per cent were 
in the process of being paid off. In urban areas the level of home 
ownership (37 per cent) was considerably lower and there was a 
much higher proportion of householders paying off their homes (32 
per cent). The high levels of home ownership in rural areas resulted 
in renting being far less common, 17 per cent compared to 27 per 
cent in urban areas. Most renting households did so from private 
owners, but 7 per cent of households in urban areas and rural 
localities and 2 per cent of households in other rural areas rented 
public housing.

In 1986, median monthly mortgage payments in rural areas were 
considerably higher than those in urban areas. Although the median 
monthly mortgage payment for dwellings in rural localities ($305) was 
lower than in urban areas ($344), the other rural areas had an extremely 
high median monthly mortgage payment of $393.

In contrast to the high mortgage payments, the amount of rent paid 
by rural households was considerably lower than that paid by urban 
households. Over 50 per cent of rural households who rented their 
dwellings paid less than $50 per week. In comparison, the median 
level of weekly rent payments for urban dwellers was $76. 


Living long distances from shopping and service facilities, business 
contacts, schools, friends and places of entertainment is a distinctive 
aspect of rural life. While public transport services (e.g. school buses) 
are available in many rural communities, rural households are still 
heavily dependent on private transport to meet day to day needs. On 
average, rural households had greater access to motor vehicles 
(excluding motor bikes and tractors) than did urban households. Less 
than 1 in 20 households in other rural areas did not have access to 
a motor vehicle, in rural localities the ratio was almost 1 in 9, while 
in urban areas it was close to 1 in 7 households. Sixty-three per cent 
of households in other rural areas owned or used two or more 
vehicles and the average for every 20 households in all rural areas 
was 36 vehicles, 8 vehicles more than for every 20 households in 
urban areas.

At the 1986 Census, over 75,000 people were counted in almost 
5,000 non-private dwellings in rural areas. While the overall 
distribution of people in private and non-private dwellings was similar 
in rural and urban areas, there were major differences in the types of 
non-private dwellings inhabited. Only a small proportion (within the 
range of 5 to 8 per cent) of people in nursing homes, hospitals and 
homes for the aged, hostels for the homeless and hostels for the 
disabled, were counted in rural areas. 


People camping out on census night were mostly found in rural areas 
(88 per cent). Other types of non-private dwellings where high 
proportions of people were counted in rural areas were staff quarters, 
typically belonging to work gangs involved in road and railway 
maintenance, mining exploration and shearing (46 per cent), 
corrective institutions (25 per cent) and residential colleges (22 per 
cent).

GLOSSARY 


Two or more people related by blood, marriage or de facto 
relationship who live in the same household. 


A person living alone, or two or more persons who live and eat 
together in private residential accommodation. 


A population cluster which contains at least 100,000 people. Includes 
all capital city statistical divisions except Darwin. 


Include hotels, motels, boarding houses, nursing homes, hospitals, 
boarding schools, reformatories, prisons, staff quarters, religious and 
charitable institutions, defence establishments and similar group living 
quarters and tents, improvised homes etc. which had communal 
eating facilities. Where the accommodation includes seif-contained 
units, the units are considered as part of the non-private dwelling, not 
as separate households. 


A population cluster which contains less than 200 people. Aboriginal 
communities on pastoral properties, and people living on outstations 
are included in this category. 


A population cluster which contains between 1,000 and 99,999 
people, or a known holiday resort with a smaller population which 
contains at least 250 dwellings of which at least 100 were occupied 
on census night. 


Normally a house, flat, part of a house or even a room, but can also 
be a house attached to, or rooms above, shops or offices, an 
occupied caravan in a caravan park or boat in a marina, a houseboat 
or tent if it is standing on its own block of land. A caravan situated 
on a residential allotment is also classed as a private dwelling. An 
occupied private dwelling is the premises occupied by a household. 
Since there may be more than one household within a structure, 
there may also be more than one dwelling in a structure. The number 
of households is equal to the number of occupied private dwellings 
and caravans etc. in caravan parks. 


Comprise rural localities (see below) and other rural areas (see 
above). 


A population cluster which contains between 200 and 999 people. 
Excludes known holiday resorts of at least 250 dwellings of which at 
least 100 were occupied on census night. 

The number of males for every 100 females. 


Comprise major urban centres and other urban centres (See above).
