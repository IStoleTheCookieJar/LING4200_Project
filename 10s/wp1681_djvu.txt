Abstract 


This paper examines the state of financial development in the Latin America and Caribbean 
(LAC) region as well as potential growth and stability implications from further 
development. The analysis suggests that access to financial institutions has expanded notably 
in the past decade, and the region compares favorably with other emerging market regions on 
this dimension. The region, however, continues to lag behind peers on broader financial 
development, especially with respect to markets, though there is substantial heterogeneity 
across countries. Financial systems in many LAC countries are also underdeveloped relative 
to their macroeconomic fundamentals. Further financial development could convey net 
benefits to the region, provided there is adequate regulatory oversight to prevent excesses.

I. INTRODUCTION 


Growth has slowed in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and the region’s medium- 
term growth prospects have been marked down. Even during the most recent commodity 
super-cycle, LAC’s growth performance improved significantly relative to the previous 
decade but still underperformed relative to other emerging market (EM) regions. Going 
forward, in a less positive external environment with lower commodity prices and lower 
global growth, LAC countries would need to look for new growth engines. In this context, 
deepening financial systems through better market access, liquidity, and diversity of 
instruments can help unleash new growth sources, better reap the benefits from globalization, 
and transition to higher income levels. 


Since early 1990s, many LAC countries have undertaken significant efforts to expand scope 
and depth of their financial systems to promote diversification and growth, cope with shocks, 
and enhance macroeconomic stability. This paper examines the current state of financial 
development in Latin America, as well as implications for potential growth and stability from 
further development. In particular, we construct a measure of financial development for a 
large sample of advanced, emerging, and developing countries, estimate financial 
development gaps in relation to country’s current fundamentals, and evaluate the relationship 
of financial development with growth and stability. 


The literature has investigated the link between growth and financial development, usually 
narrowly defined, using private credit to GDP, liquid liabilities of the financial system to 
GDP, stock market capitalization to GDP, market turnover ratio (Levine 1997, Levine 2005). 
Some studies found that there may be too much finance after a certain point (Arcand, Berkes, 
and Panizza, 2015, Sahay and others, 2015a). A separate line of research explored 
benchmarking of financial development with respect to country’s fundamentals, including 
income level (Feyen, Kibuuka, and Sourrouille 2014). However, the two strands of research 
have not been put together in a unified framework. The studies focused on financial 
development in LAC are relatively scarce (De la Torre, Ize, and Schmukler 2012), and the 
issue of “too much” finance in LAC has not been systematically examined. 


This paper attempts to fill in these gaps. Its contribution, compared to the existing literature, 
is fivefold: (i) it provides a consistent empirical framework to estimate financial development 
gaps at the current level of fundamentals as well as long-term relationship between growth 
and stability on the one hand and financial development on the other, (ii) it refines the index 
of financial development constructed in IMF (Sahay and others 2015a), (iii) it improves the 
specification of the growth/stability regressions, (iv) it employs a more comprehensive 
stability measure than that used in the literature, and (v) explores the state of financial 
development in LAC. 


II. MEASURING FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT 


Financial development has proven difficult to measure in a comprehensive way. Typical 
proxies in the literature have included the ratio of private credit to GDP (Cavallo and 


Scartascini, 2012, Hansen and Sulla, 2013, Arcand, Berkes, and Panizza, 2015) and, to a 
lesser extent, stock market capitalization (e.g. Yartey, 2008). These traditional indicators, 
however, are too narrow to capture the broad spectrum of financial sector activities. Indeed, 
non-bank financial institutions (pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds etc.) have 
grown significantly over the past decade, providing opportunities for greater consumption 
smoothing, investment funding, and risk diversification across households and firms (Figure 
1). Similarly, financial markets have grown and become more diversified, with access to 
market finance available to a wider set of economic agents. 


To better capture different facets of these trends, a new comprehensive and broad-based 














index of financial development was Figure 1: Non Bank Assets 
developed by the IMF (Sahay and others (Regional averages in percent of GDP) 
2015a). The index contains two major a =e

countries for 1995-2013. Appendix 1 describes data processing and transformations. 











All the individual variables listed in Figure 2 were normalized into an index ranging between 
zero and | using the following formula: 
= Xig ~ min(X;,) 
“ max(x,) —min(x,) 
where J, ;, is the normalized variable x of country i on year f, min(x,,) is the lowest value of 


variable X, over all it; and Max(%,) is the highest value of %,. For those variables for which 


a decrease over time would reflect financial development, such as Interest Rate Spread, Bank 
Asset Concentration, Overhead Costs, Net Interest Margin, and Non-Interest Income, we use 
the reverse formula: 

_j- i —min(x,,) 


x,it 





max(x,,) —min(x,, ) 


The sub-components of the index were then aggregated using different methods. In 
particular, we estimated the weights using five methods: principal component model in levels 
and in differences, factor analysis in levels and in differences, as well as equal weights within 
a subcomponent of the index. The aggregation results were robust to these methods. For 
simplicity, we use an index with equal weights. Table 1 in Appendix 1 shows the total 
number of observations per region and per year.

There are some striking differences between our financial development index and more 
traditional measures (Figure 3). For example, driven by large domestic banks, Honduras’ 
credit ratio—the most common measure of financial deepening—is high, suggesting strong 
financial development. Honduras, however, neither fares well on non-bank institutional 
depth, efficiency of financial institutions, nor on all aspects of financial market development, 
resulting in a weaker composite index. In a similar vein, Trinidad and Tobago’s stock market 
capitalization is currently the third highest in the region but this ranking reflects to a large 
extent cross-listing of regional companies, while market access by domestic companies and 
market efficiency measured by the turnover ratio have remained low. That points to the 
limitations of market cap measures to signal financial development. Trinidad and Tobago 
also does not score well on access to financial institutions.

Ill. FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT: WHERE DOES LAC STAND? 


Overall, countries in LAC compare unfavorably with other emerging markets (EMs) with 
respect to financial development. In fact, only low-income countries (LICs) lag behind LAC 
(Figure 4). However, results vary by component: 


e LAC scores higher on financial institutions than on financial markets, a feature shared 
with LICs. Even so, the LAC region’s scores on depth and efficiency of financial 
institutions lag other EM regions, as do its metrics for all the sub-components of 
financial market development. This pattern has also broadly held over time. 


e LAC excels relative to other EMs is access to financial institutions, reflecting the 
emphasis that countries have placed on improving financial inclusion through 
improved bank and ATM networks'. However, LAC still lags other EM regions on 
the level of usage of financial services by households (Box 1). 


There is substantial variation in financial development across LAC (Figure 5). Chile and 
Brazil rank the highest in the development of financial markets and financial institutions, 
respectively. Peru, Colombia, and Mexico are next on the list; the latter has made major 
strides recovering from its 1994 crisis. 





' For a detailed analysis of financial inclusion in LAC see Dabla-Norris and others 2015. The link between 
financial inclusion and financial stability and growth is explored in Sahay and others, 2015b. 





e Chile’s financial reforms began in the mid-1970s, with measures to facilitate bond 
and equity market development. The creation of a fully-funded pension system 
generated a large domestic institutional investor base, which provided stable demand 
for private bonds of increasingly longer maturities. Reforms in the 2000s gave 
institutional investors further flexibility to increase the portion of their portfolios 
invested in domestic equities. Currently, the domestic bond market represents almost 
40 percent of GDP, while the market value of listed companies in the equity market 
(about 90 percent of GDP) far exceeds that of its neighbors. 


° Brazil, in contrast, saw rapid development in both financial institutions and markets 
over the past decade. The government implemented a market-friendly debt 
management strategy, which helped develop the domestic capital market, including 
lengthening maturities of government bonds, building benchmarks at different points 
along the yield curve, and reviving the market for covered bonds. These reforms also 
contributed to the development of Brazil’s financial institutions—insurance company 
assets to GDP more than doubled in the past decade, while mutual fund assets grew 
from 30 percent of GDP to 50 percent of GDP, making Brazil sixth in the world, 
excluding financial centers. The markets for private bonds, equities, and derivatives 
also grew remarkably. 


e After its 1994 crisis, Mexico focused on increasing trust in the banking system by 
strengthening regulations, reforming deposit insurance, and improving collateral 
execution and information sharing among credit bureaus.” At the same time, there 
were also reforms to promote financial education and competition in the banking 
sector. All these reforms contributed to an acceleration in credit growth, which is a 
welcome development given the still low credit to GDP ratio.

Other LAC countries (such as Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru) also experienced notable 
progress in financial development over the past decade. In particular, Colombia, and Peru 





10 


took large steps in developing financial institutions as the number of commercial bank 
branches more than quadrupled. In Ecuador the number of bank branches also grew 
dramatically, driven by the expansion of two large banks and the conversion of several 
cooperatives into commercial banks. On the market side, with the exception of the Bahamas 
and El Salvador, Lac countries have not made a notable progress. 


IV. FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND MACROECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS 


For most LAC countries, the current stage of financial development does not appear to be 
fully aligned with their respective macroeconomic fundamentals. Financial development 
gaps—computed as the deviation of our index from a prediction based on economic 
fundamentals, such as income per capita, government size, macroeconomic stability, and 
others—can help identify potential distortions or other sources of financial under/over- 
development for individual countries. This analysis, however, is only suggestive, a normative 
assessment of the link between financial development and growth and stability is provided in 
the next section. 


The exact specification of regressions linking financial development (FD), institutions (FI) 
and markets (FM) development indices to fundamentals is below. Following the literature on 


benchmarking financial development (Beck and others 2008) fundamentals (X/" ) included 


initial income per capita, government consumption to GDP, inflation, trade openness, 
educational attainment proxied by the average number of years of secondary schooling for 
people 25+, population growth, capital account openness, the size of the shadow economy 


(given its importance for the LAC region) and the rule of law. Instruments (4, ) for financial 


development such as the rule of law and legal origin dummies were also used. Predicted 
norms were computed using the following equation:° 


— I FI ' FI FI 
Fly, 7 o' X;, 7, 3',Z, +h, TE; 


it >? 


where FI, stands for one of the financial indices (FD, FI or FM). Gaps shown on Figure 5 
are the difference between the actual values of the index and the calculated norms. 





>The regressions explain a large portion of the variation in financial development, with R-squares of 0.74 and 
0.61 for institutions and market regressions, respectively. Nonetheless, the lack of a solid theory on the factors 
driving financial development implies that the correct model specification is subject to uncertainty. Hence, the 
gaps should be interpreted with due caution.

Consistent with the previous studies (De La Torre and others 2012, 2014), we find that 
shortfalls on institutional efficiency and depth as well as market access and efficiency are 
common in LAC. The gaps can reflect a variety of factors. For instance, financial systems 
that experienced crises in the more recent past may still be in recovery mode. In the case of 
the Dominican Republic, which experienced a financial crisis in 2003, for example, the /ower 
levels of development than those implied by fundamentals partly reflect the erosion of trust 
in financial institutions and depressed demand for credit as a consequence of the crisis. In 
Uruguay (banking crisis in 2002), on the other hand, the negative gap mostly reflects low 
access to financial institutions and markets. Negative gaps can also result from weak 
frameworks for obtaining or seizing collateral (for instance, Peru’s negative efficiency gap). 
In other cases, such as Jamaica’s negative efficiency gap, the lack of efficiency reflects both 
high levels of bank concentration and a historical investment dependence on low risk 
government debt which has hindered banks’ capacity for risk assessments when lending to 
the private sector, thus driving up spreads. Negative market efficiency gaps in LAC are 








12 


linked to offshoring by larger companies, according to De La Torre (2012), though the 
underlying drivers still need to be identified. 


Positive gaps in financial development should also be examined for indications of potential 
excess or inefficiency. For example, Bolivia’s use of regulated interest rates and credit quotas 
for certain sectors can pose risks to banks’ profitability and generate inefficient allocation of 
credit. Similarly, rapid credit growth in Honduras beyond what can be justified by 
macroeconomic fundamentals has largely fueled consumption due to scant investment 
opportunities. In yet other countries, notably in Central America, positive gaps in the 
development of financial markets capture the fact that stock markets feature a small number 
of listed firms but hardly see any trading activity, lack adequate legal and contractual 
infrastructure, and are not viewed as an affordable financing source by the majority of 
domestic companies. However, positive gaps do not necessarily indicate stability problems— 
they simply position countries with respect to an average of countries with similar 
fundamentals. 


Countries in LAC should explore the causes behind financial development gaps. Given that 
macroeconomic fundamentals are often difficult to change in the short-term, policies to 
alleviate gaps in financial development should be tailored to address country-specific 
distortions, if identified (see Conclusions and Appendix 2 for an example of application of 
the framework developed in this paper to the case of Costa Rica). 


A. The Nexus Between Finance, Stability, and Growth: What is in Store for LAC? 


Financial development has been shown to be positively related to economic growth4. 
Efficient financial systems help channel capital to productive uses, provide insurance against 
shocks, reduce information asymmetries, and can potentially alleviate poverty and inequality 
(Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Levine, 2004). Sound financial systems can also foster 
innovation and entrepreneurship through risk diversification (King and Levine, 1993). 
However, recent studies document the existence of a certain threshold of financial 
development beyond which additional deepening generates decreasing returns to growth and 
stability (Arcand and others, 2012; Arcand, Berkes, and Panizza, 2015, Sahay and others, 
2015a). One possible explanation is that large financial systems divert resources from 
productive activities to speculative and risky financial investments (Minsky, 1975)°. Also, 
excessive leverage and risk-taking can lead to increased economic and financial volatility 
with potentially negative consequences for long-term growth, especially if regulation and 
supervision are inadequate (IMF, 2003; Reinhart and Rogoff, 2011; Sahay and others, 2015a; 
and Sahay and others, 2015b). 





4Goldsmith (1969), McKinnon (1973), Shaw (1973), Beck and Levine (2004) and Levine (2005). 
‘Diminishing returns to growth from financial development were also documented in Cecchetti and Kharroubi 
(2012, 2015), Reshef (2013), Aizenman and others (2015), Cournéde and others, (2015), and IMF (2015).

The link between financial development, growth and stability was examined using a dynamic 
panel regression framework. Regressions use 5-year averages in order to abstract from 
cyclical fluctuations, and are estimated using dynamic panel techniques common in the 


growth literature®’. Real GDP growth (DY,,) is linked to financial development allowing for a 


potential non-linearity by adding a square of financial development while controlling for 
other factors that are likely to affect growth (below). In the case of individual sub- 
components of FI and FM, the interaction term between these two indices is included. The 


controls for the growth regression X) were the same as in the benchmarking regression 


(X!" ) with two additional variables: ratio of FDI to GDP and capital account openness. 


The impact of financial development on financial and macroeconomic instability used a 
similar framework. Financial instability (7S, ) is measured by the first principal component 


of the inverse of the distance to distress (z-score),7 real credit growth volatility, and real and 
nominal interest rate volatility. This combined variable allows capturing different facets of 
financial instability, thus improving over previous research which typically focused on a 
single variable. Growth volatility (GV, ) is measured by the standard deviation of GDP 
growth. The controls included initial income per capita, government consumption to GDP, 
trade openness, changes in terms of trade, growth in per capita income, capital flows to GDP, 


exchange rate regime, a measure of political stability, and an indicator for whether a country 
is an offshore financial center. 


The following three equations were estimated using the Arellano-Bond approach:

and one with the subcomponents:

system (capitalization and returns) with the volatility of those returns.

Following previous studies on this topic, we also find non-linear relationships between 
financial development and growth (Table | and Figure 6), and between financial 
development and instability in LAC.* Financial development initially lowers the risk of 
macroeconomic instability, perhaps by creating greater opportunities for risk management, 
insurance, and diversification. However, there appears to be a turning point after which the 
marginal contribution to greater stability turns negative (Appendix).’ Similar non-linearity 
also holds for financial development and growth, which is particularly pronounced in the 


8We use a measure of financial instability calculated as the first principal component of the inverse of the z-score 
(the distance to distress), real credit growth volatility, and real and nominal interest rate volatility. For growth 
volatility the standard deviation of GDP growth is used. 


°We tried testing the relevance of regulatory quality, as proxied by a dummy variable based on a z score (see 
Appendix), as a conditioning variable for the link between financial development and growth. However, 
adequately measuring regulatory quality presents a serious challenge due to (i) the lack of an appropriate measure 
across countries and over time, and, more important, (i1) because most regulatory changes occur in response to 
financial crises which also affect growth, causing endogeneity problems for the regression.

relationship between institutional depth and growth. This maybe because a large financial 
system is more likely to give room for excessively risky behavior (Bruno and Shin, H. Song, 
2014; Rajan 2005), which could generate excessive credit creation. This may, in turn, 
portend large credit losses and macroeconomic instability, thus hindering strong and durable 
growth (Cecchetti and Kharroubi 2015). However, the linear relationship between growth 
and financial services efficiency suggests continued welfare gains from a more efficient 
financial sector though there could be stability costs as reduced bank profitability could 
provide incentives to diversify into riskier business areas. The latter, however, is not 
necessarily the case — e.g. efficiency gains in the financial systems dominated by inefficient 
public banks could be obtained by creating a level playing field for private banks without 
increase in risk-taking. 


Comparing financial institutions and markets, while the relationship for financial institution 
development is quite robust across growth and stability regressions, effects from financial 
market development on any of the endogenous variables are weaker at lower levels of 
financial market development but become important at the higher development levels for 
growth and growth volatility. Financial market development is also complementary to 
institutional development in terms of raising growth.

Regression evidence also suggests that too much market development at the early stages of 
institutional development may have negative effects on stability. This is likely because the 
increased volatility from market development dominates when financial institutions are not 
strong enough to help insure against shocks. In particular, rapid market development driven 
by liberalization and deregulation without sound institutional and legal setting can make a 
country more vulnerable to market manipulation, volatile capital flows, and financial crises 
(Laeven 2014, De La Torre and Schmukler 2006). For similar levels of development, 





16 


however, institutions and markets complement each other positively for both growth and 
stability. Hence, a gradual approach, aimed at first securing gains in institutional 
development before taking steps towards market development, may be warranted. 


In sum, there is scope for further financial development in LAC over the longer horizon. 
Most of the countries in the region have not yet reached the turning point where marginal 
growth dividends from additional financial development become negative. Brazil and Chile 
are nearest this “optimum” level of financial development, whereas the Dominican Republic, 
Paraguay, and Honduras are on the opposite side of the spectrum (Figure 7). Note that these 
relationships stem from a partial analysis that assumes that all other growth determinants 
(such as income level, inflation, government size, etc.) are held constant while financial 
development is consistent with the level of macroeconomic fundamentals.

Thus, in the longer term, reaping maximum benefits from financial development for growth 
and stability would also require improving a country’s macroeconomic fundamentals, which 
in turn would support the further development of financial systems. This is an interactive 
process whereby financial systems are shaped by fundamentals, and fundamentals evolve 
partly as a function of more developed financial systems. Estimates should, however, be 
interpreted with caution since it is difficult to disentangle causality in econometric terms, 
even though instrumental variables were used to address potential endogeneity issues.'° 





OWe use system GMM estimation (Arellano and Bover, 1995; Blundell and Bond, 1998) to address the dynamic 
dependence of our variables of interest and potential endogeneity of control variables. We also employ additional 
instrumental variables used in the literature, namely, rule of law (Kaufmann, Kraay and Mastruzzi 2010) and a 
set of dummies for the country’s legal origin (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes and Shleifer 2008).

V. CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS 


Financial systems in LAC have developed and deepened in recent years but continue to lag 
other emerging market groupings, especially with respect to financial market development. 
More importantly, some countries have financial development gaps compared with the levels 
implied by their macroeconomic fundamentals. In particular, gaps on institutional efficiency 
and depth as well as market access and efficiency are common. 


Given that the fundamentals are sticky in the short term, countries should explore policies 
tailored to their own circumstances and that aim to remove the distortions and, in turn, help 
close the financial development gaps, if any. 


While there is no one-size-fits-all solution, the literature points to several important building 
blocks for a well-functioning financial system such as (1) strong property rights; (ii) efficient 
legal system; (111) low incidence of corruption; (iv) sufficient financial information; (iv) good 
corporate governance; and (v) sound prudential regulation and supervision of the banking 
system (Mishkin 2007, Laeven 2014). These building blocks could be useful in designing 
policies geared toward closing financial development gaps in LAC. 

For example, LAC countries that are recovering from financial crises could benefit from 
improving the credibility of financial systems, strengthening capital and liquidity buffers, 
ensuring credible deposit insurance, and addressing balance-sheet mismatches. Many of these 
reforms were undertaken in Mexico after the 1994 crisis and have proven invaluable— 
although a negative financial development gap still remains in Mexico. 


Countries that have negative gaps in the depth and efficiency of financial institutions (such as 
the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Peru) could explore strengthening institutional and 
legal frameworks related to property rights and collateral, as well as improving the efficiency 
of courts and credit reporting systems (Emerging Market Committee, 2012). 


Similarly, LAC countries that have underdeveloped bond markets (such as Costa Rica and 
Uruguay) could benefit from following market-friendly debt management and issuance 
strategies to help foster secondary markets for government securities, such as the use of 
standardized simple instruments with conventional maturities, as well as strengthening legal 
and regulatory frameworks. 


Finally, countries where stock markets are underdeveloped or inefficient, which includes the 
majority of LAC countries, could benefit from strong macroeconomic environment, 
institutional and legal frameworks, which promote investor rights, information disclosure, as 
well as policies that increase market size (e.g., pension reforms, carefully sequenced financial 
liberalization, corporate governance and tax reforms; see Laeven 2014). However, in smaller 
LAC economies developing domestic equity markets may not be justified due to the small 
market size. Hence, a careful investigation of specific country circumstances with the view of 
identifying constraints, including those outside of the financial sector such as poor corporate 
governance, as well as tradeoffs is needed.In countries where financial development levels 


18 


are higher than those implied by macroeconomic fundamentals (i.e., positive development 
gaps), efforts could be reinforced to enhance supervisory vigilance aimed at improving credit 
quality and avoiding problems of poor underwriting quality as well as strengthening 
macroprudential policy frameworks. 


In the longer term, as fundamentals continue to evolve, LAC countries could benefit from 
further financial development by stimulating economic growth without jeopardizing 
macroeconomic and financial stability. The process, however, is likely to be gradual and 
iterative with income growth supporting financial development and vice versa. 


When financial development proceeds too fast, it can lead to economic and financial 
instability, especially where regulation and supervision do not keep pace. Hence, developing 
regulation and supervision that are consistent with the existing level of financial development 
and embed enough flexibility to address future challenges in financial deepening is an 
important safeguard. 


The sequencing of reforms could also be important. Indeed, care should be taken in not 
promoting excessive market development when financial institutions are underdeveloped, 
since this would jeopardize macroeconomic and financial stability. 


Lastly, since financial integration will move in tandem as regional financial systems develop, 
care should be taken to reap the benefits from integration while safeguarding against risks. 
Furthering financial integration could help generate regional economies of scale (especially 
for smaller countries) enabling markets to achieve minimum viable sizes and facilitate 
regional risk diversification. On the other hand, closer interconnections would also require 
coordination across supervisory and regulatory agents in order to ensure appropriately 
organized responses (Enoch and others, 2016).

APPENDIX 1: DATA DESCRIPTION AND PROCESSING 


In this section we explain how we construct the Index of Financial Development (FD) and its 
components. Also, we explain where we get the data and how we process the information to 
produce the final Index. Table 2 shows Index’s components and subcomponents. 


Sources and data gathering 


Our data sources are referred in Table Al. We found annual data starting in the 1960s but for 
nearly all of the countries the data were only available from mid 1990s. Therefore, we decide 
to set our period of analysis from 1995 to 2013 (the last date available in most cases). Yet, 
the database was inadequate for building an index. For example, data gaps and outliers did 
not reflect accurately the general trends in the data. Most countries in Middle East, Sub- 
Sahara Africa and Latin America had large data gaps. As for some variables, like ATMs per 


thousands of adults, we could only find data available from 2004.

abroad. 


Building a consistent dataset 


To build a consistent dataset across regions and countries, and to obtain the longest possible 
sample period, we supplement and extrapolate the data where feasible. The data conversions 
also help with achieving a balanced panel. 


We supplement the data with national sources: from central banks and national statistic 
agencies. Alternative, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and the World Federation of 
Exchanges were used. Nonetheless, most of the data came from the IMF’s Financial Sector 


Assessment Program reports (FSAPs). For those countries that we could not find any data to 
fill the gaps, we use a linear interpolation procedure: that is the same as to fill the gaps with a 
linear projection between two available data points. 


20 


We identify outliers using two methods that take on count the trending nature of most of the 
series. Taking one country and one variable at the time, we estimate the trend component in 
the series and calculate the gap between the actual and the trend!''. We define an outlier as a 
point in time that is 3 standard deviations above or below our calculated gap. 


In some rare cases, however, where 2 or 3 outliers stand close to each other, this method did 
not single them out of the estimated trend; instead, these values pull the estimated trend 
closer to them. Hence, we run a second procedure: we calculate the growth rate of the 
variables, and taking one variable per country at the time, we define an outlier as a point 
where the growth rate exceeds 3 standard deviations of the sample period. Finally, we drop 
all the outliers and replace them with the linear interpolation method —just as we did at the 
beginning. 


A clean database with no gaps and with unbalanced samples was still not adequate to carry 
out principle components analysis for aggregation. Thus, we extrapolate the data backwards 





using a method called exponential smoothing". 








We apply this method to every variable per Table A2: Regions and Coverage 
country back to 1995. We also tried other Countries: "Total 
methods instead, but this last seemed to be the Region RERYERE:_ (ORs: 
most conservative of all. To extrapolate bastlple:Eacihic il, on

per region per year. 


The index constructed this way was aggregated as described using principle component and 
factor analysis as well as equal weights. The factor weights are theoretically most appropriate 
as the goal of the exercise is to identify the common factor underlying the movements in the 
variables (see also Amidzi¢c, Massara, and Mialou (2014) and Camara and Tuesta (2014) on 
the discussion of theoretical advantages of common factor analysis for weights construction). 
However, since the results turned out to be very similar (Table A2) for simplicity we present 
the results for the index with equal weights. 


The main differences between the index employed in this paper and that constructed in Sahay 
and others 2015a can be summarized as follows: 





'l The estimation of the trend component and the cycle uses a Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter with a lambda equal 
to 6.25. 
'2 See for example Holt (2004) and the references therein. 





ZA 


Our index is supplemented with additional data from IMF Financial Sector 
Assessment Programs and country reports. We extend the data back to 1995 while 
Sahay and others 2015a extend the missing series back to 1980. 


We use exponential extrapolation method in contrast to the average growth rates of 
all the non-missing observations of the variable employed in Sahay and others 201 5a. 


We employ a different procedure for eliminating outliers, namely, we eliminate 
observations that exceed three standard deviations above or below the trend while 
Sahay and others 2015a eliminate observations below the 5" and above the 95" 
percentiles. To fill in the resulting gaps from dropped outliers we use simple linear 
interpolation technique while Sahay and others 2015a employ a winsorization 
technique, which replaces the outliers with the values for the 5" and the 95" 
percentiles, respectively. 


We use equal weights while Sahay and others 2015a employ principle component 
analysis for index construction.

APPENDIX 2: AN EXAMPLE OF FRAMEWORK APPLICATION TO COSTA RICA 


This Appendix examines how the framework presented in the paper can be applied in the 
case of particular country such as Costa Rica. 


Where Does Costa Rica Stand? 
Costa Rica’s financial system deepened notably in the past decade but continues to lag 
behind those of other emerging markets. The improvements came from growth in financial 
institutions, in particular, better institutional access and improved efficiency. In contrast, 
market development stagnated. Despite the recent progress, Costa Rica continues to lag 
behind other emerging markets on many dimensions. In particular, it lags other EM groups 
on all of the subcomponents of financial market development. It is also behind other EMs on 
some aspects of institutional development, though performance varies by component. In fact, 
Costa Rica compares favorably on institutional access, outperforming all other EM country 
groupings. Good access reflects a relatively wide network of ATMs and bank branches per 
100,000 adults. However, the country lags behind other EMs on institutional efficiency, 
though it slightly exceeds the LAC average on this component. Low efficiency reflects high 
interest rate spreads, high overhead costs, and high net interest margins. Finally, Costa Rica 
is behind all other country groupings on institutional depth due to the low level of credit and 
deposits to GDP as well as small mutual fund and insurance industries.

Costa Rica’s financial development is also below the levels predicted by country’s 
fundamentals. A simple cross-country comparison above does not account for differences in 
the underlying macroeconomic conditions. Financial development gaps—the deviation of the 
financial development index from a prediction based on economic fundamentals, such as 
income per capita, government size, and macroeconomic stability—can help identify 
potential under or overdevelopment of Costa Rica, compared to countries with similar 
fundamentals. These gaps suggest that Costa Rica’s financial development is below the 





levels predicted by its macroeconomic 
fundamentals on all but two 
subcomponents. The exceptions are 
two narrow measures of institutional 
efficiency, namely, 3-bank asset 
concentration and non-interest income. 
Other measures, however, including 
lending-deposit spread, bank interest 
margin, and overhead cost, point to 
inefficiencies in the banking sector. To 
the extent that the negative gaps reflect 
distortions or market frictions, they 
need to be addressed. For example, 
high interest rate spreads are likely a 


reflection of the substantial presence of

Gaps with respect to fundamentals 





public banks, which lack strong incentives to improve efficiency. The relatively low credit- 
to-GDP ratio at least to some extent reflects a weak legal collateral framework, which was in 
place before 2015, and was probably one of the causes of the high collateral-to-loan ratio. 


Costa Rica has not yet reached the levels of institutional and market development that 
yield maximum benefits to growth and stability. Costa Rica is still far away from reaping 
the maximum benefits to growth and stability, in particular, in terms of financial market 
development. In the longer term, reaping maximum benefits from financial development for 
growth and stability would require improving Costa Rica’s macroeconomic fundamentals. 


Conclusions and Policy Recommendations 
e Costa Rica’s financial system deepened notably in the past decade, but continues to 
lag behind those of other emerging markets as well as the level of development 
implied by its macroeconomic fundamentals. 


e Given that the fundamentals are sticky in the short term, Costa Rica should aim at 
removing distortions that prevent the country from reaching its full financial 
development potential given the current state of macroeconomic fundamentals. 


>» To facilitate deepening on the side of financial institutions, Costa Rica should 
follow through on the modernization of its collateral framework while balancing 
it with proper regulation and supervision. In 2015, the country adopted a new 
secured transactions law that establishes a functional secured transactions system 
and a modern, centralized, notice-based collateral registry. The law also 
broadened the range of assets that can be used as collateral, including intangibles 
such as intellectual property rights, allowed a general description of assets granted 
as collateral and permitted out-of-court enforcement of collateral. Nevertheless, 





24 


careful monitoring is warranted at this stage to hinder abuse as the new system is 
being tested. 


To improve efficiency of financial intermediation it should ensure a level playing 
field for private banks compared to public banks. An important first step would be 
to remove the explicit guarantee currently given by the state to all colon- 
denominated deposits in state banks. 


Costa Rica could benefit from following market-friendly debt management and 
issuance strategies to help foster secondary markets for government securities, 
such as the use of standardized simple instruments with conventional maturities, 
as well as strengthening legal and regulatory frameworks. 


To promote the development of the stock market Costa Rica would certainly gain 
from a more robust macroeconomic environment, as well as stronger institutional 
and legal frameworks, which promote investor rights, information disclosure, as 
well as policies that increase market size, in particular, those supporting the 
development of an institutional investor base In recent years, an important step 
has been taken by allowing private participation into the insurance sector where it 
used to be a state monopoly but more could be done to encourage further entry. 
Strengthening protection of minority investors — an area where Costa Rica does 
not score well in Doing Business indictors - could also help. Finally, reviewing 
tax treatment of securities issuance and investment to make the tax system more 
attractive to issuers may be warranted as long as it does not jeopardize fiscal 
sustainability objectives. 


In the longer term, as fundamentals continue to evolve, including toward a higher 
income per capita, further financial development would be advantageous for Costa 
Rica in terms of growth and stability, provided there is adequate regulatory oversight 
to prevent excesses.
