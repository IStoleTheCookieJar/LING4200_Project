PAID  UP  OIL  AND  GAS  LEASE 

THIS  LEASE  AGREEMENT  (this  "Lease")  is  made  as  of  theÂ«?/  day  of  /Q/>+6&Cir  2008,  between  the 
Helen  Schuck,  whose  address  is  5032  Arborlawn  Dr,  Fort  Worth,  TX  76109,  as  Lessor,  and  XTO  Energy  Inc.,  whose 
address  is  810  Houston  Street,  Fort  Worth,  Texas  76102,  as  Lessee. 

1.  Leased  Premises.  In  consideration  of  a  cash  bonus  paid  upon  execution  of  this  Lease,  and  the  covenants  herein 
contained,  Lessor  hereby  grants,  leases  and  lets  exclusively  to  Lessee  the  land  described  on  Exhibit  "A"  attached  hereto  (the 
"leased  premises")  in  Tarrant  County,  Texas  (including  any  interests  therein  which  Lessor  may  hereafter  acquire  by 
reversion,  prescription  or  otherwise),  for  the  purpose  of  exploring  for,  developing,  producing  and  marketing  oil  and  gas.  For 
purposes  of  this  Lease,  "oil  and  gas"  means  oil,  gas  and  other  liquid  and  gaseous  hydrocarbons  and  their  constituent  elements 
produced  through  a  well  bore.  "Oil"  includes  all  condensate,  distillate  and  other  liquid  and  gaseous  hydrocarbons  produced 
through  a  well  bore.  "Gas"  includes  helium,  carbon  dioxide  and  other  commercial  gases,  as  well  as  hydrocarbon  gases. 
Expressly  excluded  from  this  Lease  are  lignite,  coal,  sulfur  and  other  like  minerals.  The  leased  premises  shall  include  all 
strips  and  gores,  streets,  easements,  highways  and  alleyways  adjacent  thereto.  Lessor  agrees  to  execute  at  Lessee's  request 
any  additional  or  supplemental  instruments  reasonably  necessary  for  a  more  complete  or  accurate  description  of  the  leased 
premises.  In  the  event  Lessor  owns  any  additional  acreage  than  that  for  which  bonus  was  originally  paid,  Lessee  shall  pay 
additional  bonus  at  the  rate  per  acre  on  which  bonus  was  originally  paid  when  this  Lease  was  acquired.  For  the  purpose  of 
determining  the  amount  of  any  shut-in  royalties  hereunder,  the  number  of  gross  acres  specified  on  Exhibit  "A"  shall  be 
deemed  correct,  whether  actually  more  or  less. 

2.  Term.  This  Lease  is  a  "paid  up"  lease  requiring  no  rentals.  Subject  to  the  other  provisions  contained  herein,  this 
Lease  shall  be  for  a  term  of  three  (3)  years  from  the  date  hereof  (the  "primary  term"),  and  for  as  long  thereafter  as  oil  or  gas 
or  other  substances  covered  hereby  are  produced  in  paying  quantities  from  the  leased  premises  or  from  lands  pooled 
therewith,  or  this  Lease  is  otherwise  maintained  in  effect  pursuant  to  the  provisions  hereof. 

3.  Royalty.  Royalties  on  oil,  gas  and  other  substances  produced  and  saved  hereunder  shall  be  paid  by  Lessee  to 
Lessor  as  follows:  (a)  for  oil  and  other  liquid  hydrocarbons  separated  at  Lessee's  separator  facilities,  the  royalty  shall  be 
twenty  five  percent  (25%)  of  such  production,  to  be  delivered  at  Lessee's  option  to  Lessor  at  the  wellhead  or  to  Lessor's 
credit  at  the  oil  purchaser's  transportation  facilities,  provided  that  Lessee  shall  have  the  continuing  right  to  purchase  such 
production  at  the  wellhead  market  price  then  prevailing  in  the  same  field  (or  if  there  is  no  such  price  then  prevailing  in  the 
same  field,  then  in  the  nearest  field  in  which  there  is  such  a  prevailing  price)  for  production  of  similar  grade  and  gravity;  and 
(b)  for  gas  (including  casinghead  gas)  and  all  other  substances  covered  hereby,  the  royalty  shall  be  twenty  five  percent  (25%) 
of  the  proceeds  realized  by  Lessee  from  the  sale  thereof,  computed  at  the  point  of  sale,  less  a  proportionate  part  of  ad  valorem 
taxes  and  production,  severance  or  other  excise  taxes,  and  less  the  permitted  unaffiliated  third  party  deductions  authorized 
below;  provided  that  Lessee  shall  have  the  continuing  right  to  purchase  such  production  at  the  prevailing  wellhead  market 
price  paid  for  production  of  similar  quality  in  the  same  field  (or  if  there  is  no  such  price  then  prevailing  in  the  same  field, 
then  in  the  nearest  field  in  which  there  is  such  a  prevailing  price)  pursuant  to  comparable  purchase  contracts  entered  into  on 
the  same  or  nearest  preceding  date  as  the  date  on  which  Lessee  commences  its  purchases  hereunder.  If  at  the  end  of  the 
primary  term  or  any  time  thereafter  one  or  more  wells  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith  are  capable  of 
producing  oil  or  gas  or  other  substances  covered  hereby  in  paying  quantities,  but  such  well  or  wells  are  either  shut-in  or 
production  therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee,  such  well  or  wells  shall  nevertheless  be  deemed  to  be  producing  in  paying 
quantities  for  the  purpose  of  maintaining  this  Lease.  A  well  that  has  been  drilled  but  not  fraced  shall  be  deemed  capable  of 
producing  in  paying  quantities.  If  for  a  period  of  ninety  (90)  consecutive  days  such  well  or  wells  are  shut-in  or  production 
therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee,  then  Lessee  shall  pay  shut-in  royalty  of  seventy-five  dollars  ($75.00)  per  acre  then 
covered  by  this  Lease  on  or  before  the  end  of  said  90-day  period  and  thereafter  on  or  before  each  anniversary  of  the  end  of 
said  90-day  period  while  the  well  or  wells  are  shut-in  or  production  therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee;  provided, 
however  that  if  this  Lease  is  otherwise  being  maintained  by  operations,  or  if  production  is  being  sold  by  Lessee  from  another 
well  or  wells  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  no  shut-in  royalty  shall  be  due  until  the  end  of  the  90-day 
period  next  following  cessation  of  such  operations  or  production.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  herein,  it  is 
expressly  understood  and  agreed  that  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term,  Lessee  shall  not  have  the  right  to  continue  this 
Lease  in  force  by  payment  of  shut-in  royalty  for  more  than  a  single  period  of  up  to  two  (2)  consecutive  years. 

Royalties  on  oil,  gas  and  other  substances  produced  and  saved  hereunder  which  are  processed  in  a  processing  plant 
in  which  Lessee,  or  an  affiliate  of  Lessee,  has  a  direct  or  indirect  interest,  shall  be  calculated  based  upon  the  higher  of  the 
proceeds  received  or  the  market  value  of  the  products  so  processed.  Similarly,  on  oil,  gas  and  other  substances  produced  and 
saved  hereunder  which  are  sold  to  Lessee,  or  an  affiliate  of  Lessee,  royalties  shall  be  paid  based  upon  the  higher  of  the 
market  value  of  the  products  so  sold  and  the  proceeds  received  by  Lessee  for  said  products.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the 
contrary  herein  except  for  nonaffiliated  third-party  charges  incurred  or  paid  by  Lessee  to  transport,  gather,  compress, 
stabilize  process  or  treat  gas  produced  from  the  leased  premises,  or  lands  pooled  therewith  (including  fuel  charges),  in  no 
event  shall  any  of  Lessor's  royalty  bear  any  part  of  the  costs  of  production  or  any  post-production  costs,  including  costs  of 
lifting  gathering,  dehydration,  compression,  separation,  delivery,  transportation,  manufacture,  processing,  treating  or 
marketing  or  for  construction,  operation  or  depreciation  of  any  plant  or  other  facility  or  equipment  for  processing  or  treating 
oil  or  gas  produced  from  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith.  In  no  event  shall  Lessor  receive  a  price  greater  than 
or  less  than  Lessee  in  sales  to  nonaffi Hates. 

As  used  herein,  "affiliate"  means  (i)  a  corporation,  joint  venture,  partnership  or  other  entity  that  owns  more  than 
ten  percent  (10%)  of  the  outstanding  voting  interest  of  Lessee  or  in  which  Lessee  owns  more  than  ten  percent  (10%)  of  the 


outstanding  voting  interest;  or  (ii)  a  corporation,  joint  venture,  partnership  or  other  entity  in  which,  together  with  Lessee, 
more  than  ten  percent  ( 1 0%)  of  the  outstanding  voting  interest  of  both  the  Lessee  and  the  other  corporation,  joint  venture, 
partnership*  or  other  entity  is  owned  or  controlled  by  the  same  person  or  group  of  persons. 

4.  Payments,  All  shut-in  or  other  royalty  payments  under  this  Lease  shall  be  paid  or  tendered  to  Lessor  at  the  above 
address,  or  at  such  address  or  to  Lessor's  credit  at  such  depository  institution  as  Lessor  may  provide  written  notice  of  from 
time  to  time.  All  payments  or  tenders  may  be  made  in  currency,  by  check  or  by  draft.  Unless  there  is  a  reasonable  title 
dispute  or  question  as  to  title,  Lessee  must  disburse  or  cause  to  be  disbursed  to  Lessor  its  royalty  on  production  from  a 
particular  well  not  later  than  one  hundred  twenty  (120)  days  after  the  end  of  the  month  of  first  sales  of  production. 
Thereafter,  Lessee  must  disburse  or  caused  to  be  disbursed  to  Lessor  its  royalty  on  production  by  the  last  day  of  the  second 
month  after  the  month  in  which  production  is  sold.  If  not  paid  when  due,  Lessor's  royalty  will  bear  interest  at  the  statutory 
rate  from  due  date  until  paid,  which  amount  Lessee  agrees  to  pay. 

5.  Continuous  Drilling  Obligations.  If  Lessee  drills  a  well  which  is  incapable  of  producing  in  paying  quantities  (a 
"dry  hole")  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  or  if  all  production  (whether  or  not  in  paying  quantities) 
permanently  ceases  from  any  cause,  including  a  revision  of  unit  boundaries  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Section  6  or  the 
action  of  any  governmental  authority,  then  in  the  event  this  Lease  is  not  otherwise  being  maintained  in  force  it  shall 
nevertheless  remain  in  force  if  Lessee  commences  operations  for  reworking  an  existing  well  or  for  drilling  an  additional  well 
or  for  otherwise  obtaining  or  restoring  production  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith  within  ninety  (90)  days 
after  completion  of  operations  on  such  dry  hole  or  within  ninety  (90)  days  after  such  cessation  of  all  production.  If  at  the  end 
of  the  primary  term,  or  at  any  time  thereafter,  this  Lease  is  not  otherwise  being  maintained  in  force  but  Lessee  is  then 
engaged  in  drilling,  reworking  or  any  other  operations  reasonably  calculated  to  obtain  or  restore  production  therefrom,  this 
Lease  shall  remain  in  force  so  long  as  any  one  or  more  of  such  operations  are  prosecuted  with  no  cessation  of  more  than 
ninety  (90)  consecutive  days,  and  if  any  such  operations  result  in  the  production  of  oil  or  gas  or  other  substances  covered 
hereby,  as  long  thereafter  as  there  is  production  in  paying  quantities  from  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith. 
After  completion  of  a  well  capable  of  producing  in  paying  quantities  hereunder,  Lessee  shall  drill  such  additional  wells  on  the 
leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith  as  a  reasonably  prudent  operator  would  drill  under  the  same  or  similar 
circumstances  (a)  to  develop  the  leased  premises  as  to  formations  then  capable  of  producing  in  paying  quantities  on  the 
leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  or  (b)  to  protect  the  leased  premises  from  uncompensated  drainage  by  any  well  or 
wells  located  on  other  lands  not  pooled  therewith.  There  shall  be  no  covenant  to  drill  exploratory  wells  or  any  additional 
wells  except  as  expressly  provided  herein. 

6.  Pooling.  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  but  not  the  obligation  to  pool  all  or  any  part  of  the  leased  premises  or  interests 
therein  with  any  other  lands  or  interests,  as  to  any  or  all  depths  or  zones,  and  as  to  any  or  all  substances  covered  by  this  lease, 
either  before  or  after  the  commencement  of  production,  whenever  Lessee  deems  it  necessary  or  proper  to  do  so  in  order  to 
prudently  develop  or  operate  the  leased  premises,  whether  or  not  similar  pooling  authority  exists  with  respect  to  such  other 
lands  or  interests;  provided,  however,  that  the  entire  leased  premises  covered  by  this  Lease  shall  be  included  in  any  unit 
created  pursuant  to  the  pooling  authority  granted  herein.  The  unit  formed  by  such  pooling  for  an  oil  well  which  is  not  a 
horizontal  completion  shall  not  exceed  eighty  (80)  acres  plus  a  maximum  acreage  tolerance  of  ten  percent  (10%),  and  for  a 
gas  well  or  a  horizontal  completion  shall  not  exceed  six  hundred  forty  (640)  acres  plus  a  maximum  acreage  tolerance  of  ten 
percent  (10%);  provided  that  a  larger  unit  may  be  formed  for  an  oil  well  or  gas  well  or  horizontal  completion  to  conform  to 
any  well  spacing  or  density  pattern  that  may  be  prescribed  or  permitted  by  any  governmental  authority  having  jurisdiction  to 
do  so.  For  the  purpose  of  the  foregoing,  the  terms  "oil  well"  and  "gas  well"  shall  have  the  meanings  prescribed  by  applicable 
law  or  the  appropriate  governmental  authority,  or,  if  no  definition  is  so  prescribed,  "oil  well"  means  a  well  with  an  initial  gas- 
oil  ratio  of  less  than  100,000  cubic  feet  per  barrel  and  "gas  well"  means  a  well  with  an  initial  gas-oil  ratio  of  100,000  cubic 
feet  or  more  per  barrel,  based  on  24-hour  production  test  conducted  under  normal  producing  conditions  using  standard  lease 
separator  facilities  or  equivalent  testing  equipment;  and  "horizontal  completion"  means  a  well  in  which  the  horizontal 
component  of  the  gross  completion  interval  in  the  reservoir  exceeds  the  vertical  component  thereof.  In  exercising  its  pooling 
rights  hereunder,  within  ninety  (90)  days  of  first  production,  Lessee  shall  file  of  record  a  written  declaration  describing  the 
unit  and  stating  the  effective  date  of  pooling  which  may  be  retroactive  to  first  production.  In  the  event  Lessor's  acreage  is 
included  in  a  well,  all  of  Lessor's  acreage  shall  be  included.  Production,  drilling  or  reworking  operations  anywhere  on  a  unit 
which  includes  the  leased  premises  shall  be  treated  as  if  it  were  production,  drilling  or  reworking  operations  on  the  leased 
premises,  except  that  the  production  on  which  Lessor's  royalty  is  calculated  shall  be  that  proportion  of  the  total  unit 
production  which  the  net  acreage  covered  by  this  Lease  and  included  in  the  unit  bears  to  the  total  gross  acreage  in  the  unit. 
Pooling  in  one  or  more  instances  shall  not  exhaust  Lessee's  pooling  rights  hereunder,  and  Lessee  shall  have  the  recurring 
right  but  not  the  obligation  to  revise  any  unit  formed  hereunder  by  expansion  or  contraction  or  both,  either  before  or  after 
commencement  of  production,  in  order  to  conform  to  the  well  spacing  or  density  pattern  prescribed  or  permitted  by  the 
governmental  authority  having  jurisdiction,  or  to  conform  to  any  productive  acreage  determination  made  by  such 
governmental  authority.  In  making  such  a  revision,  Lessee  shall  file  of  record  a  written  declaration  describing  the  revised 
unit  and  stating  the  effective  date  of  revision.  If  the  leased  premises  are  included  in  or  excluded  from  the  unit  by  virtue  of 
such  revision,  the  proportion  of  unit  production  on  which  royalties  are  payable  hereunder  shall  thereafter  be  adjusted 
accordingly.  In  the  absence  of  production  in  paying  quantities  from  a  unit,  or  upon  permanent  cessation  thereof,  Lessee  may 
terminate  the  unit  by  filing  of  record  a  written  declaration  describing  the  unit  and  stating  the  date  of  termination.  Pooling 
hereunder  shall  not  constitute  a  cross-conveyance  of  interests.  If  this  lease  now  or  hereafter  covers  separate  tracts,  no  pooling 
or  unitization  of  royalty  interest  as  between  any  such  separate  tracts  is  intended  or  shall  be  implied  or  result  merely  from  the 
inclusion  of  such  separate  tracts  within  this  Lease  but  Lessee  shall  nevertheless  have  the  right  to  pool  as  provided  above  with 
consequent  allocation  of  production  as  above  provided.  As  used  in  this  paragraph,  the  words  "separate  tract"  mean  any  tract 
with  royalty  ownership  differing,  now  or  hereafter,  either  as  to  parties  or  amounts,  from  that  as  to  any  other  part  of  the  leased 
premises. 

7.  Partial  Interests.  If  Lessor  owns  less  than  the  full  mineral  estate  in  all  or  any  part  of  the  leased  premises,  the 
royalties  and  shut-in  royalties  payable  hereunder  for  any  well  on  any  part  of  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith 
shall  be  reduced  to  the  proportion  that  Lessor's  interest  in  such  part  of  the  leased  premises  bears  to  the  full  mineral  estate  in 
such  part  of  the  leased  premises.

8.      Assignment.  The  interest  of  either  Lessor  or  Lessee  hereunder  may  be  assigned,  devised  or  otherwise  transferred 

neir  respective  heirs,  devisees,  executors,  administrators,  successors  and  assigns;  provided  however  if  Lessee  assign's  anv

18-  Off-Site  Drillsite.  As  a  result  of  land  development  in  the  vicinity  of  the  lease  premises,  governmental  rules  or 
ordinances  regarding  well  sites,  and/or  surface  restrictions  as  may  be  set  forth  in  this  lease  and/or  other  leases  in  the  vicinity, 
surface  locations  for  well  sites  in  the  vicinity  may  be  limited  and  Lessee  may  encounter  difficulty  securing  surface  location(s) 
for  drilling,  reworking  or  other  operations.  Therefore,  since  drilling,  reworking  or  other  operations  are  either  restricted  or  not 
allowed  on  the  lease  premises  or  other  leases  in  the  vicinity,  it  is  agreed  that  any  such  operations  conducted  at  a  surface 
location  off  of  the  lease  premises  or  off  of  lands  with  which  the  lease  premises  are  pooled  in  accordance  with  this  lease, 
provided  that  such  operations  are  associated  with  a  directional  well  for  the  purpose  of  drilling,  reworking,  producing  or  other 
operations  under  the  lease  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  shall  for  purposes  of  this  lease  be  deemed  operations 
conducted  on  the  lease  premises.  Nothing  contained  in  this  paragraph  is  intended  to  modify  any  surface  restrictions  or 
pooling  provisions  or  restrictions  contained  in  this  lease,  except  as  expressly  stated. 

19. Option  to  Extend.  Lessee  is  hereby  given  the  option,  to  be  exercised  prior  to  the  date  on  which  this  lease  or  any  portion 
thereof  would  expire  in  accordance  with  its  terms  and  provisions  of  extending  this  lease  for  a  period  of  two  (2)  years  as  to  all 
or  any  portion  of  the  acreage  then  held  hereunder  which  would  expire  unless  so  extended.  The  only  action  required  by  Lessee 
to  exercise  such  option  being  the  payment  to  Lessor  (or  for  Lessor's  credit  at  the  depository  bank  named  herein)  and/or  such 
parties  entitled  under  any  change  of  ownership  according  to  Lessee's  records,  an  additional  consideration  of  the  sum  of 
Twenty  Thousand  Dollars  ($20,000.00)  per  net  mineral  acre  owned  by  the  party  entitled  to  such  payment  at  such  time  of 
extension,  in  the  acreage  so  extended.  If  this  lease  is  extended  as  to  only  a  portion  of  the  acreage  then  covered  hereby,  Lessee 
shall  designate  such  portion  by  a  recordable  instrument.

other  provision  herein  and  that  the  parties  shall  attempt  in  good  faith  to  renegotiate  that  provision  so  determined  to  be  invalid

instrument.  Singular  and  plural  terms,  as  well  as  terms  stated  in  the  masculine,  feminine  or  neuter  gender,  shall  be  read  to
