ABSTRACT 


This  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  has  been  prepared  in  response  to  an  application 
submitted  on  May  25,  2010  to  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  by  PSEG 
Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG),  for  an  early  site  permit  (ESP).  The  proposed 
actions  requested  in  the  PSEG  application  are  (1 )  the  NRC  issuance  of  an  ESP  for  the  PSEG 
Site  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  and  Salem  Generating 
Station,  Units  1  and  2,  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  and  (2) 
U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  permit  action  on  a  Department  of  the  Army  permit 
application  to  perform  certain  construction  activities  on  the  site.  The  USACE  is  a  cooperating 
agency  with  the  NRC  in  preparing  this  EIS  and  participates  collaboratively  on  the  review  team. 

This  EIS  includes  the  review  team’s  analysis  that  considers  and  weighs  the  environmental 
impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site,  at 
alternative  sites  and  mitigation  measures  available  for  reducing  or  avoiding  adverse  impacts. 
The  EIS  also  addresses  Federally  listed  species,  cultural  resources,  essential  fish  habitat 
issues,  and  plant  cooling  system  design  alternatives. 

The  EIS  includes  the  evaluation  of  the  proposed  action’s  impacts  on  waters  of  the  United  States 
pursuant  to  Section  404  of  the  Clean  Water  Act  and  Section  1 0  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors 
Appropriation  Act  of  1899.  The  USACE  will  conduct  a  public  interest  review  in  accordance  with 
the  guidelines  promulgated  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  under  authority  of 
Section  404(b)  of  the  Clean  Water  Act.  The  public  interest  review,  which  will  be  addressed  in 


November  2015 


NUREG-2168 


Abstract 


the  USACE  permit  decision  document,  will  include  an  alternatives  analysis  to  determine  the 
least  environmentally  damaging  practicable  alternative. 

After  considering  the  environmental  aspects  of  the  proposed  NRC  action,  the  NRC  staffs 
recommendation  to  the  Commission  is  that  the  ESP  be  issued  as  requested. 

This  recommendation  is  based  on  (1)  the  application  submitted  by  PSEG,  including  Revision  4 
of  the  Environmental  Report  (ER),  and  the  PSEG  responses  to  requests  for  additional 
information  from  the  NRC  and  USACE  staffs;  (2)  consultation  with  Federal,  State,  Tribal,  and 
local  agencies;  (3)  the  staffs  independent  review;  (4)  the  staffs  consideration  of  comments 
related  to  the  environmental  review  that  were  received  during  the  public  scoping  process  and 
the  public  comment  period  following  the  publication  of  the  draft  EIS;  and  (5)  the  assessments 
summarized  in  this  EIS,  including  the  potential  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  ER  and  this 
EIS.  The  USACE  will  issue  its  Record  of  Decision  based,  in  part,  on  this  EIS.

EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY 


This  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  presents  the  results  of  a  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory 
Commission  (NRC)  environmental  review  of  an  application  for  an  early  site  permit  (ESP)  at  a 
proposed  site  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  In  support  of  its  proposed  action  of  issuing  a 
Department  of  the  Army  permit,  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  participated  in  the 
preparation  of  the  EIS  as  a  cooperating  agency  and  as  a  collaborative  member  of  the  review 
team,  which  consisted  of  the  NRC  staff,  its  contractor  staff,  and  the  USACE  staff. 

BACKGROUND 

On  May  25,  2010,  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG)  submitted  an 
application  to  the  NRC  for  an  ESP  at  the  PSEG  Site  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope 
Creek  Generating  Station  (HCGS)  and  Salem  Generating  Station  (SGS)  in  Lower  Alloways 
Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  On  June  5,  2015,  PSEG  submitted  a  fourth 
revised  version  of  its  application,  which  also  included  an  Environmental  Report  (ER). 

Upon  acceptance  of  PSEG's  initial  application,  the  NRC  review  team  began  the  environmental 
review  process  as  described  in  Title  10  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  52  by 
publishing  in  the  Federal  Register  on  October  15,  2010,  a  Notice  of  Intent  to  prepare  an  EIS  and 
conduct  scoping.  As  part  of  the  environmental  review,  the  review  team  did  the  following: 

•  considered  comments  received  during  the  60-day  scoping  process  that  began  on 
October  15,  2010,  and  conducted  related  public  scoping  meetings  on  November  4,  2010  in 
Carneys  Point,  New  Jersey; 

•  conducted  site  audits  from  April  17,  2012  through  April  19,  2012  and  from  May  7,  2012 
through  May  1 1 ,  2012; 

•  conducted  public  meetings  on  the  draft  EIS  on  October  1,  2014  in  Carneys  Point,  New 
Jersey  and  on  October  23,  2014  in  Middletown,  Delaware; 

•  considered  comments  received  during  the  105-day  comment  period  for  the  draft  EIS,  which 
began  on  August  22,  2014; 

•  reviewed  PSEG’s  ER  and  developed  requests  for  additional  information  using  guidance 
from  NUREG-1555,  Standard  Review  Plans  for  Environmental  Reviews  for  Nuclear  Power 
Plants:  Environmental  Standard  Review  Plan ;  and 

•  consulted  with  Native  American  tribes  and  Federal  and  State  agencies  such  as  the  U.S. 

Fish  and  Wildlife  Service,  the  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service,  the  Advisory  Council  on 
Historic  Preservation,  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection,  the  New 
Jersey  State  Historic  Preservation  Office,  and  the  State  of  Delaware  Office  of  Historical  and 
Cultural  Affairs.

Executive  Summary 


PROPOSED  ACTION 

The  proposed  actions  related  to  the  PSEG  application  are  (1)  the  NRC  issuance  of  an  ESP  for 
the  PSEG  Site  and  (2)  the  USACE  issuance  of  a  Department  of  the  Army  permit  pursuant  to 
Section  404  of  the  Federal  Water  Pollution  Control  Act  (Clean  Water  Act  [CWA])  and  Section  10 
of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors  Appropriation  Act  of  1899,  as  amended,  to  perform  certain  dredge 
and  fill  activities  on  the  site. 

PURPOSE  AND  NEED  FOR  ACTION 

The  purpose  and  need  for  the  NRC  proposed  action — issuance  of  the  ESP — is  to  provide  for 
early  resolution  of  site  safety  and  environmental  issues,  which  provides  stability  in  the  licensing 
process.  Although  no  reactor  will  be  built  at  the  PSEG  Site  under  this  action  (the  ESP),  to 
resolve  environmental  issues  the  staff  assumed  in  this  EIS  that  one  or  two  reactors  with  the 
parameters  specified  in  the  plant  parameter  envelope  (PPE)  would  be  built  and  operated.  Any 
new  nuclear  plant  would  provide  for  additional  electrical  generating  capacity  to  meet  the  need 
for  up  to  2,200  MW(e)  of  baseload  power  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey  by  2021 . 

The  objective  of  the  PSEG-requested  USACE  action  is  to  obtain  a  Department  of  the  Army 
individual  permit  to  perform  regulated  dredge  and  fill  activities  that  would  affect  wetlands  and 
other  waters  of  the  United  States.  The  basic  purpose  of  obtaining  the  Department  of  the  Army 
individual  permit  is  for  PSEG  to  conduct  work  associated  with  building  a  power  plant  to  generate 
electricity  for  additional  baseload  capacity. 

PUBLIC  INVOLVEMENT 

A  60-day  scoping  period  was  held  from  October  15,  2010  through  December  14,  2010,  and  on 
November  4,  2010,  the  NRC  held  public  scoping  meetings  in  Carneys  Point,  New  Jersey  during 
which  interested  parties  were  invited  to  provide  comments  on  the  applicant’s  ER.  The  review 
team  received  many  oral  comments  during  the  public  meetings  and  12  written  statements, 

7  letters,  and  1  e-mail  during  the  scoping  period  on  topics  including  surface-water  hydrology, 
ecology,  socioeconomics,  historic  and  cultural  resources,  air  quality,  uranium  fuel  cycle,  energy 
alternatives,  and  benefit-cost  balance. 

In  addition,  during  the  105-day  comment  period  on  the  draft  EIS,  the  review  team  held  public 
meetings  in  Carneys  Point,  New  Jersey  on  October  1,  2014  and  in  Middletown,  Delaware  on 
October  23,  2014.  A  combined  total  of  approximately  75  people  attended  the  public  meetings  in 
New  Jersey,  and  approximately  140  people  attended  the  public  meetings  in  Delaware. 

A  number  of  attendees  at  each  meeting  provided  oral  comments. 

AFFECTED  ENVIRONMENT 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS 
and  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The 
PSEG  Site  is  on  the  eastern  bank  of  the  Delaware  River  about  1 8  mi  south  of  Wilmington, 
Delaware,  and  30  mi  southwest  of  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania.  The  site  is  about  7  mi  east  of 
Middletown,  Delaware;  7.5  mi  southwest  of  Salem,  New  Jersey;  and  9  mi  south  of  Pennsville,

Cooling  water  for  any  new  nuclear  units  constructed  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  obtained  from 
the  Delaware  River.  These  units  would  use  either  mechanical  or  natural  draft  cooling  towers  to 
transfer  waste  heat  to  the  atmosphere.  A  portion  of  the  water  obtained  from  the  Delaware  River

EVALUATION  OF  ENVIRONMENTAL  IMPACTS 

When  evaluating  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  nuclear  power  plant  construction1 
and  operations,  the  NRC’s  authority  is  limited  to  construction  activities  related  to  radiological 
health  and  safety  or  common  defense  and  security;  that  is,  under  1 0  CFR  51 .4,  the 
NRC-authorized  activities  are  related  to  safety-related  structures,  systems,  or  components  and 
may  include  pile  driving;  subsurface  preparation;  placement  of  backfill,  concrete,  or  permanent 
retaining  walls  within  an  excavation;  installation  of  foundations;  or  in-place  assembly,  erection, 
fabrication,  or  testing.  In  this  EIS,  the  NRC  review  team  evaluates  the  potential  environmental 
impacts  of  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  for  the 
following  resource  areas; 

•  land  use, 

•  air  quality, 

•  aquatic  ecology, 

•  terrestrial  ecology, 

•  surface  water  and  groundwater, 

•  waste  (radiological  and  nonradiological), 

•  human  health  (radiological  and  nonradiological), 

•  socioeconomics  and  environmental  justice,  and 

•  historic  and  cultural  resources. 

This  EIS  also  evaluates  impacts  associated  with  accidents,  the  fuel  cycle,  decommissioning, 
and  transportation  of  radioactive  materials. 

The  impacts  are  designated  as  SMALL,  MODERATE, 
or  LARGE.  The  incremental  impacts  related  to  the 
construction  and  operations  activities  requiring  the 
NRC  authorization  are  described  and  characterized, 
as  are  the  cumulative  impacts  resulting  from  the 
proposed  action  when  the  effects  are  added  to,  or 
interact  with,  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably 
foreseeable  future  effects  on  the  same  resources. 

Table  ES-1  provides  a  summary  of  the  cumulative 
impacts  for  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review  team  found 
that  the  cumulative  environmental  impacts  would  be 
SMALL  for  several  resource  categories,  including 

demography,  nonradiological  health,  radiological  health,  severe  accidents,  waste,  fuel  cycle, 
decommissioning,  and  transportation. 


SMALL:  Environmental  effects  are 
not  detectable  or  are  so  minor  that 
they  will  neither  destabilize  nor 
noticeably  alter  any  important  attribute 
of  the  resource. 

MODERATE:  Environmental  effects 
are  sufficient  to  alter  noticeably,  but 
not  to  destabilize,  important  attributes 
of  the  resource. 

LARGE:  Environmental  effects  are 
clearly  noticeable  and  are  sufficient  to 
destabilize  important  attributes  of  the 
resource.

(a)  The  entry  “None”  for  Environmental  Justice  does  not  mean  there  are  no  adverse  impacts 

to  minority  or  low-income  populations  from  the  proposed  action.  Rather,  “None”  means 

that,  while  there  may  be  adverse  impacts,  those  impacts  do  not  affect  minority  or  low- 

income  populations  in  any  disproportionate  manner,  relative  to  the  general  population. 

The  cumulative  socioeconomic  impacts  for  physical  impacts,  infrastructure  and  community 
services,  and  air  quality  would  be  SMALL  to  MODERATE.  The  review  team  found  that  the 
cumulative  environmental  impacts  on  land  use,  surface-water  use  and  quality,  groundwater  use 
and  quality,  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecosystems,  and  historic  and  cultural  resources  would  be 
MODERATE.  However,  the  contributions  of  impacts  from  the  NRC-authorized  activities  would 
be  SMALL  for  all  of  the  above-listed  resource  areas,  except  for  land-use  impacts;  physical 
impacts,  infrastructure  and  community  services  impacts,  and  historic  and  cultural  resources. 
The  new  cooling  towers  would  contribute  to  MODERATE  cumulative  physical  impacts 
associated  with  aesthetics  in  certain  locations,  and  traffic  impacts  during  the  peak  periods  for 
building  a  new  nuclear  plant  would  contribute  to  MODERATE  cumulative  impacts  for 
infrastructure  and  community  services.

NUREG-21 68 


Executive  Summary 


Incremental  impacts  associated  with  the  development  of  the  causeway  and  the  transmission 
lines  would  be  the  principal  contributors  to  the  MODERATE  cumulative  impacts  for  land  use  and 
for  historic  and  cultural  resources.  Extensive  past  and  present  use  of  surface  water  from  the 
Delaware  River  would  be  the  primary  driver  for  the  MODERATE  impacts  for  surface-water  use 
and  quality.  Similarly,  extensive  past  and  present  groundwater  withdrawals  from  the  local 
aquifer  system  would  contribute  to  the  MODERATE  cumulative  impacts  to  groundwater 
resources. 

Cumulative  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecosystem  impacts  would  be  MODERATE  because  of  the 
loss  of  habitat  from  development  of  the  causeway  and  the  transmission  line  corridors.  The 
significant  history  of  the  degradation  of  the  Delaware  Bay  and  Delaware  River  Estuary  has  had 
a  noticeable  and  sometimes  destabilizing  effect  on  many  aquatic  species  and  communities. 
Building  and  operating  any  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  in  conjunction  with  the 
operations  of  the  existing  HOGS  and  SGS  nuclear  units,  would  contribute  to  MODERATE  to 
LARGE  cumulative  impacts  to  aquatic  ecosystems. 

The  cumulative  impacts  to  taxes  and  the  economy  would  be  beneficial  and  would  range  from 
SMALL  for  the  State  of  New  Jersey  and  the  region  to  LARGE  for  Salem  County. 

There  are  few  minority  or  low-income  populations  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  review  team 
identified  no  pathways  for  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  on  minority  or  low- 
income  populations. 

The  cumulative  impacts  on  air  quality  would  range  from  SMALL  for  criteria  pollutants  to 
MODERATE  for  greenhouse  gases,  based  on  both  their  emissions  and  associated 
concentrations  in  the  atmosphere. 

NEED  FOR  POWER  AND  ALTERNATIVES 

The  review  team  assessed  the  need  for  the  power  that  would  be  produced  by  the  proposed 
project  and  determined  that  if  the  plant  were  to  be  built  on  schedule  (i.e.,  by  2021 ),  there  would 
be  a  demonstrated  need  for  the  capacity  of  the  largest  proposed  reactor  design  in  the  PPE, 
such  that  the  benefits  of  the  proposed  project  (i.e.,  the  power  it  would  provide)  would  be 
realized. 

The  review  team  also  considered  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  alternatives  to 
issuing  an  ESP  for  the  PSEG  Site.  These  alternatives  included  a  no-action  alternative  (i.e.,  not 
issuing  the  ESP),  as  well  as  alternative  energy  sources,  siting  locations,  and  system  designs. 

The  no-action  alternative  would  result  in  the  ESP  not  being  granted  or  the  USACE  not  issuing 
its  permit.  Upon  such  a  denial,  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  in  accordance  with  the  10  CFR  52  (10  CFR  52-TN251)  process  referencing  an  approved 
ESP  would  not  occur,  and  the  predicted  environmental  impacts  would  not  take  place.  If  other 
generating  sources  were  built  to  meet  the  need  for  power,  either  at  another  site  or  using  a 
different  energy  source,  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  those  other  sources  would 
eventually  occur.  The  review  team  also  assessed  the  need  for  the  power  that  would  be 
produced  by  the  proposed  project  and  determined  that  if  the  plant  were  to  be  built  on  schedule 


NUREG-2168

November  2015 


Executive  Summary 


(by  2021),  there  would  be  a  demonstrated  need  for  the  capacity  of  the  largest  proposed  reactor 
design  in  the  PPE,  such  that  the  benefits  of  the  proposed  project  (the  power  it  would  provide) 
would  be  realized. 

Based  on  the  review  team’s  review  of  energy  alternatives,  the  review  team  eliminated  several 
energy  sources  (e.g.,  wind,  solar,  and  biomass)  from  full  consideration  because  those 
technologies  are  not  currently  capable  of  meeting  the  baseload  electricity  need.  The  review 
team  concluded  that,  from  an  environmental  perspective,  none  of  the  viable  baseload 
alternatives  (i.e.,  natural  gas,  coal,  or  a  combination  of  alternatives)  is  clearly  environmentally 
preferable  to  building  new  baseload  nuclear  power  generating  units  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Table  ES-2  provides  a  comparative  summary  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  viable  energy 
alternatives. 

The  review  team  compared  the  cumulative  effects  of  the  proposed  action  at  the  PSEG  Site 
against  those  at  the  alternative  sites.  The  following  four  alternatives  sites  were  selected  for 
review  (see  Figure  ES-2): 

•  Site  4-1  in  Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey; 

•  Site  7-1  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey; 

•  Site  7-2  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey;  and 

•  Site  7-3  in  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey. 

Table  ES-3  provides  a  comparative  summary  of  the  cumulative  impacts  for  the  alternative  sites. 
Although  there  are  differences  and  distinctions  between  the  cumulative  environmental  impacts 
of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  or  at  one  of  the 
alternative  sites,  the  review  team  concludes  that  these  differences  are  not  sufficient  to 
determine  that  any  of  the  alternative  sites  would  be  environmentally  preferable  to  the  PSEG  Site 
for  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  In  such  a  case,  the  PSEG  Site  prevails 
because  none  of  the  alternative  sites  are  clearly  environmentally  preferable. 

The  review  team  considered  various  alternative  systems  designs,  including  alternative  heat- 
dissipation  systems  and  multiple  alternative  intake,  discharge,  and  water-supply  systems. 

The  review  team  identified  no  alternatives  for  the  PSEG  Site  that  would  be  environmentally 
preferable  to  the  systems  designs  used  as  the  basis  for  analysis  in  this  EIS.  However,  if  at 
some  time  in  the  future  PSEG  requests  authorization  from  the  NRC  (e.g.,  a  combined  license) 
to  build  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  the  review  team  will  need  to  compare  the 
specific  heat  dissipation  design  chosen  to  the  other  designs  that  were  included  in  the  PPE 
(Section  9.4.1  provides  more  detail  on  this  matter).

Executive  Summary 


BENEFITS  AND  COSTS 

The  review  team  compiled  and  compared  the  pertinent  analytical  conclusions  reached  in  this 
EIS.  All  of  the  expected  impacts  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  were  gathered  and  aggregated  into  two  final  categories:  (1)  the  expected 
environmental  costs  and  (2)  the  expected  benefits  to  be  derived  from  approval  of  the  proposed 
action.  Although  the  analysis  in  Section  1 0.6  of  this  EIS  is  conceptually  similar  to  a  purely 
economic  benefit-cost  analysis,  which  determines  the  net  present  dollar  value  of  a  given  project, 
the  intent  of  that  section  is  to  identify  potential  societal  benefits  of  the  proposed  activities  and 
compare  them  to  the  potential  internal  (i.e.,  private)  and  external  (i.e. ,  societal)  costs  of  the 
proposed  activities.  In  general,  the  purpose  is  to  inform  the  ESP  process  by  gathering  and 
reviewing  information  that  demonstrates  the  likelihood  that  the  benefits  of  the  proposed 
activities  outweigh  the  aggregate  costs. 

On  the  basis  of  the  assessments  in  this  EIS,  the  building  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  with  mitigation  measures  identified  by  the  review  team,  would  accrue 
benefits  (e.g.,  the  electricity  produced)  that  most  likely  would  outweigh  the  economic, 
environmental,  and  social  costs.  For  the  NRC-proposed  action  (i.e.,  the  issuance  of  the  ESP), 
the  accrued  future  benefits  would  also  outweigh  the  costs  of  preconstruction,  construction,  and 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

RECOMMENDATION 

The  NRC  staffs  recommendation  to  the  Commission  related  to  the  environmental  aspects  of  the 
proposed  action  is  that  the  ESP  should  be  issued  as  proposed. 

This  recommendation  is  based  on  the  following: 

•  the  application,  including  the  ER  and  its  revisions,  submitted  by  PSEG; 

•  consultation  with  Federal,  State,  Tribal,  and  local  agencies; 

•  consideration  of  public  comments  received  during  scoping  and  the  public  comment  period 
following  the  publication  of  the  draft  EIS;  and 

•  the  review  team’s  independent  review  and  assessment  as  detailed  in  this  EIS. 

In  making  its  recommendation,  the  NRC  staff  determined  that  none  of  the  alternative  sites  is 
environmentally  preferable  (and  therefore,  also  not  obviously  superior)  to  the  PSEG  Site.  The 
NRC  staff  also  determined  that  none  of  the  energy  or  cooling-system  alternatives  assessed  is 
environmentally  preferable  to  the  proposed  action. 

The  NRC  staffs  determination  is  independent  of  the  USACE’s  determination  of  whether  the 
PSEG  Site  is  the  least  environmentally  damaging  practicable  alternative  pursuant  to  CWA 
Section  404(b)(1 )  Guidelines.  The  USACE  will  conclude  its  analysis  of  both  offsite  and  onsite 
alternatives  in  its  Record  of  Decision.

1.0  INTRODUCTION 


On  May  25,  2010,  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  received  an  application 
pursuant  to  Title  10  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  52  (TN251),  from  PSEG 
Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG),  for  an  early  site  permit  (ESP)  for  a  site  located 
adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  (HCGS)  and  Salem  Generating  Station 
(SGS)  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  On  June  23,  2015,  , 
PSEG  submitted  a  fourth  revised  version  of  its  application,  including  the  Environmental  Report 
(ER),  so  unless  stated  otherwise,  any  reference  in  this  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  to 
the  ER  refers  to  Revision  4  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Under  the  NRC  regulations  in  1 0  CFR  Part 
52  (TN251)  and  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  provisions  of  10  CFR  Part  51  (TN250),  which 
are  the  NRC  regulations  implementing  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969  (NEPA) 

(42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661 ),  the  NRC  is  required  to  prepare  an  EIS  as  part  of  its  review  of  an 
ESP  application. 

Following  the  issuance  of  the  draft  EIS,  PSEG  submitted  a  Federal  and  State  application  to  the 
U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  and  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental 
Protection  (NJDEP)  for  the  Alteration  of  Any  Floodplains,  Waterways,  or  Tidal  or  Nontidal 
Wetlands  in  New  Jersey  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

The  proposed  actions  related  to  the  PSEG  application  are  (1)  the  NRC  issuance  of  an  ESP  for 
the  PSEG  Site  and  (2)  the  USACE  permit  action  on  a  Department  of  the  Army  (DA)  permit 
application  pursuant  to  Section  404  of  the  Federal  Water  Pollution  Control  Act  (Clean  Water  Act 
[CWA];  33  USC  1251  et  seq.  [TN662])  and  Section  10  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors  Appropriation 
Act  of  1899  (RHAA;  33  USC  403  et  seq.  [TN660]).  The  USACE  is  a  cooperating  agency  with 
the  NRC  to  verify  that  the  information  presented  in  this  EIS  is  adequate  to  fulfill  the 
requirements  of  the  USACE  regulations  found  at  33  CFR  Part  320  et  seq.  (TN424)  and  the  U.S. 
Environmental  Protection  Agency’s  (EPA’s)  "Section  404(b)(1)  Guidelines  for  Specification  of 
Disposal  Sites  for  Dredged  or  Fill  Material”  (40  CFR  Part  230-TN427),  hereafter  the  404(b)(1) 
Guidelines.  The  USACE  has  the  authority  to  issue  permits  for  proposed  work  or  structures  in 
and  under  navigable  waters  and  the  discharge  of  dredged  and/or  fill  material  into  waters  of  the 
United  States.  The  USACE  regulates  activities  that  would  temporarily  or  permanently  impact 
wetlands  and  water  bodies  involved  in  this  project. 

1.1  Background 

An  ESP  is  a  Commission  approval  of  a  site  for  one  or  more  nuclear  power  facilities.  Issuance  of 
an  ESP  is  a  process  that  is  separate  from  the  issuance  of  a  construction  permit  (CP),  an 
operating  license  (OL),  or  a  combined  construction  permit  and  operating  license  (combined 
license  or  COL)  for  such  a  facility.  The  ESP  application  and  review  process  makes  it  possible 
to  evaluate  and  resolve  safety  and  environmental  issues  related  to  siting  before  the  applicant 
makes  a  large  commitment  of  resources.  If  an  ESP  is  approved,  the  applicant  can  “bank”  the  site 
for  up  to  20  years  for  future  reactor  siting.  An  ESP  does  not,  however,  authorize  construction  and 
operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant.  To  construct  and  operate  a  nuclear  power  plant,  an  ESP 
holder  must  obtain  a  CP  and  an  OL,  or  a  COL,  which  are  separate  major  Federal  actions  that 
require  their  own  environmental  reviews  in  accordance  with  10  CFR  Part  51  (TN250).

Introduction 


As  part  of  its  evaluation  of  the  environmental  aspects  of  the  action  proposed  in  an  ESP 
application,  the  NRC  prepares  an  EIS  in  accordance  with  10  CFR  52.18  (TN251)  and 
10  CFR  Part  51  (TN250).  Because  site  suitability  encompasses  construction  and  operational 
parameters,  the  EIS  addresses  impacts  of  both  construction  and  operation  of  reactors  and 
associated  facilities.  In  a  review  separate  from  the  EIS  process,  the  NRC  analyzes  the  safety 
characteristics  of  the  proposed  site  and  emergency  planning  information.  These  latter  two 
analyses  are  documented  in  a  separate  safety  evaluation  report  (SER)  (NRC  2015-TN4369) 
that  presents,  in  accordance  with  10  CFR  Part  52  (TN251),  the  conclusions  reached  by  the 
NRC  regarding  the  following  issues: 

•  whether  there  is  reasonable  assurance  that  a  reactor  or  reactors,  having  characteristics  that 
fall  within  the  parameters  for  the  site,  can  be  constructed  and  operated  without  undue  risk  to 
the  health  and  safety  of  the  public; 

•  whether,  if  complete  and  integrated  emergency  plans  are  submitted  (as  PSEG  did),  the 
emergency  plans  meet  the  applicable  requirements  of  10  CFR  Part  50  (TN249)  and  its 
appendices  such  that  there  is  reasonable  assurance  that  adequate  protective  measures  can 
and  will  be  taken  in  the  event  of  a  radiological  emergency;  and 

•  whether  site  characteristics  are  such  that  adequate  security  plans  and  measures  can  be 
developed. 

1.1.1  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 

The  applicant  for  an  ESP  need  not  provide  a  detailed  design  of  a  reactor  or  reactors  and  the 
associated  facilities,  but  should  provide  sufficient  bounding  parameters  and  characteristics  of 
the  reactor  or  reactors  and  the  associated  facilities  so  that  an  assessment  of  site  suitability  can 
be  made.  Consequently,  the  ESP  application  may  refer  to  a  plant  parameter  envelope  (PPE)  as 
a  surrogate  for  a  nuclear  power  plant  and  its  associated  facilities. 

A  PPE  is  a  set  of  values  of  plant  design  parameters  that  an  ESP  applicant  expects  will  bound 
the  design  characteristics  of  the  reactor  or  reactors  that  might  be  constructed  at  a  given  site. 

The  PPE  values  are  a  bounding  surrogate  for  actual  reactor  design  information.  Analysis  of 
environmental  impacts  based  on  a  PPE  approach  permits  an  ESP  applicant  to  defer  the 
selection  of  a  reactor  design  until  the  CP  or  COL  stage.  The  PPE  is  discussed  in  more  detail  in 
Section  3.2  and  Appendix  I  of  this  EIS. 

1.1.2  Site  Preparation  and  Preliminary  Construction  Activities 

PSEG  submitted  an  application  to  the  NRC  for  an  ESP  that  did  not  include  a  request  for  a 
limited  work  authorization  (LWA).  Prior  to  receiving  a  CP  or  COL,  the  holder  of  an  ESP  without 
an  LWA  may  only  perform  preliminary  activities  that  do  not  require  NRC  authorization,  as 
enumerated  in  10  CFR  50.10(a)(2)  (TN249).  These  preliminary  activities  can  include  clearing 
and  grading,  excavating,  erection  of  support  buildings  and  transmission  lines,  and  other 
associated  activities.  Because  the  ESP,  if  granted,  would  authorize  no  activities  that  would 
allow  discharges  into  jurisdictional  waters,  a  CWA  Section  401  certification  is  not  required  prior 
to  the  issuance  of  this  ESP.  Subsequently,  if  PSEG  applies  for  a  CP,  COL,  or  LWA,  a  CWA 
Section  401  certification  from  the  State  of  New  Jersey  would  be  required,  and  any  conditions  of 
the  CWA  Section  401  certification  would  be  incorporated  into  the  license  pursuant  to  10  CFR 


NUREG-2168

Introduction 


50.54(aa)  (TN249).  The  NRC  regulations  (10  CFR  50.54(aa)  [TN249])  incorporate  into  the 
license  any  conditions  in  the  CWA  Section  401  certification. 

The  purpose  of  the  USACE  action  is  to  provide  a  DA  action  on  PSEG’s  permit  application  to 
build  proposed  structures  and  perform  work  in  and  underwaters  of  the  United  States,  including 
wetlands,  and  to  discharge  dredged  and/or  fill  material  into  waters  of  the  United  States, 
including  jurisdictional  wetlands. 

1.1.3  NRC  ESP  Application  Review 

In  accordance  with  10  CFR  52.17(a)(2)  (TN251 ),  PSEG  submitted  an  ER  as  part  of  its  ESP 
application  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  ER  focuses  on  the  environmental  effects  of  construction 
and  operation  of  reactors  with  characteristics  that  fall  within  the  PPE.  The  ER  also  includes  an 
evaluation  of  alternative  sites  to  determine  whether  there  is  an  obviously  superior  alternative  to 
the  proposed  site.  The  ER  is  not  required  to  include,  but  does  include,  an  assessment  of  the 
benefits  of  the  proposed  action  (e.g.,  the  need  for  power)  and  a  discussion  of  energy 
alternatives. 

The  NRC  staff  conducts  its  reviews  of  ESP  applications  in  accordance  with  guidance  set  forth  in 
review  standard  RS-002,  Processing  Applications  for  Early  Site  Permits  (NRC  2004-TN2219). 
The  review  standard  draws  from  the  previously  published  NUREG-0800,  Standard  Review  Plan 
for  the  Review  of  Safety  Analysis  Reports  for  Nuclear  Power  Plants  (NRC  2007-TN61 3),  and 
NUREG-1 555,  Standard  Review  Plans  for  Environmental  Reviews  for  Nuclear  Power  Plants: 
Environmental  Standard  Review  Plan  (ESRP)  (NRC  2000-TN614).  RS-002  provides  guidance 
to  the  NRC  staff  reviewers  to  help  ensure  a  thorough,  consistent,  and  disciplined  review  of  any 
ESP  application.  As  stated  in  RS-002,  an  applicant  may  elect  to  use  a  PPE  approach  instead  of 
supplying  specific  design  information.  The  NRC  staffs  June  23,  2003,  responses  to  comments 
received  on  draft  RS-002  provide  additional  insights  on  the  NRC  staffs  expectations  and 
potential  approach  to  the  review  of  an  application  using  the  PPE  approach  (NRC  2003- 
TN2064).  Specifically,  the  NRC  staff  adapted  the  ESRP  review  guidance  to  the  PPE  concept. 
The  findings  in  this  EIS  reflect  the  adaptation  of  the  ESRP  guidance  to  the  PPE  approach. 

In  addition,  the  NRC  staff  also  considered  the  information  and  analyses  provided  in  NUREG- 
1437,  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants  (GEIS) 
(NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999-TN289;  NRC  2013-TN2654),  in  its  review.  Because  the  GEIS 
included  a  review  of  data  from  all  operating  nuclear  power  plants,  some  of  the  information  was 
useful  for  the  environmental  review  of  the  proposed  action.  The  NRC  staff  has  identified  in  the 
text  those  areas  where  this  information  has  been  used.  Additional  guidance  on  conducting 
environmental  reviews  is  provided  in  Interim  Staff  Guidance  on  Environmental  Issues  Associated 
with  New  Reactors  (NRC  2014-TN3767). 

Pursuant  to  1 0  CFR  51 .75(b)  (TN250),  an  EIS  prepared  by  the  NRC  staff  on  an  application  for 
an  ESP  focuses  on  the  environmental  effects  of  construction  and  operation  of  a  reactor,  or 
reactors,  that  has  design  characteristics  that  fall  within  the  site  characteristics  and  design 
parameters.

Introduction 


Such  an  EIS  must  also  include  an  evaluation  of  alternative  sites  to  determine  whether  there  is 
any  obviously  superior  alternative  to  the  site  proposed.  The  Commission  regulations  recognize 
that  certain  matters  need  not  be  resolved  at  the  ESP  stage  (e.g.,  an  assessment  of  the  benefits, 
need  for  power,  and  energy  alternatives)  and,  thus,  may  be  deferred  until  an  applicant  decides 
to  apply  for  a  CP  or  COL.  Nevertheless,  this  EIS  does  include  an  assessment  of  the  need  for 
power  (see  Chapter  8)  and  of  the  energy  alternatives  (see  Section  9.2). 

The  PSEG  ESP  application,  including  its  ER,  was  submitted  under  oath  or  affirmation. 
Applicants  use  the  body  of  the  NRC  regulatory  guidance  (e.g.,  Regulatory  Guides,  Review 
Standards,  and  Standard  Review  Plans)  and  can  take  advantage  of  approaches  and  methods 
that  are  acceptable  to  the  NRC  to  analyze  environmental  impacts.  The  NRC  staff  relied  upon 
the  ER  as  a  source  of  basic  information  about  the  plant  parameters,  the  site,  the  region,  and  the 
environment.  Subsequent  to  the  acceptance  of  the  application,  the  NRC  staff  visited  the  site; 
consulted  with  Federal,  State,  Tribal,  and  local  agencies;  and  conducted  its  own  independent 
review.  This  EIS  is  the  result  of  the  NRC  staffs  review  and  properly  includes  material  from 
various  sources,  including  the  ER.  Ultimately,  the  NRC  is  responsible  for  the  reliability  of  all  of 
the  information  used  in  its  EIS.  If,  as  part  of  its  independent  review,  the  NRC  determines  that 
information  presented  in  the  ER  is  useful  and  the  NRC  confirms  its  accuracy,  then  the  NRC  may 
use  the  information  in  its  EIS. 

If  a  CP  or  COL  applicant  references  the  ESP,  then  in  accordance  with  1 0  CFR  51 .50(c)  and 
51.92(e)  (TN250),  the  ER  would  contain — and  the  NRC  staff  would  consider — any  new  and 
significant  information  for  issues  related  to  the  impacts  of  construction  and  operation  of  the 
facility  that  were  resolved  in  the  ESP  proceeding.  Appendix  J  of  this  EIS  contains  a  list  of 
representations  and  assumptions  used  by  the  NRC  staff  to  assess  environmental  impacts 
associated  with  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  The  information  in 
Appendix  J  is  meant  to  aid  the  staff  and  the  applicant  in  identifying  new  and  potentially 
significant  information  at  the  COL  stage,  but  it  does  not  replace  the  analyses  in  the  EIS.  As 
described  above,  information  that  is  new  and  significant  is  subject  to  reexamination  at  the  COL 
or  CP  stage;  however,  the  alternative  site  selection  process  is  considered  to  be  resolved 
through  the  ESP  review  process  and  is  not  addressed  in  a  supplemental  EIS. 

As  provided  by  10  CFR  52.39(a)(2)  (TN251),  the  Commission  shall  treat  those  matters  that  are 
resolved  through  this  EIS  as  resolved  in  any  later  proceeding  on  an  application  for  a  CP  or  COL 
referencing  the  requested  PSEG  ESP.  However,  as  required  by  10  CFR  51.50(c)  (TN250),  a 
CP  or  COL  applicant  must  identify  whether  there  is  new  and  significant  information  on  these 
resolved  issues.  This  requirement  complements  the  obligation  of  a  CP  or  COL  applicant 
referencing  an  ESP  to  provide  information  to  resolve  any  significant  environmental  issue  not 
considered  in  the  previous  proceeding  on  the  ESP.  Issuance  of  either  a  CP  (and  OL)  or  a  COL 
to  construct  and  operate  a  nuclear  power  plant  is  a  major  Federal  action  that  requires  its  own 
environmental  review  in  accordance  with  10  CFR  Part  51  (TN250).  As  provided  in  10  CFR 
52.79  (TN251)  and  under  NEPA  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661),  the  CP  or  COL  environmental 
review  will  be  informed  by  the  EIS  prepared  at  the  ESP  stage,  and  the  NRC  staff  intends  to  use 
tiering  and  incorporation-by-reference  whenever  it  is  appropriate  to  do  so.  The  CP  or  COL 
applicant  must  address  any  other  issue  not  considered  or  not  resolved  in  the  EIS  for  the  ESP. 
Moreover,  pursuant  to  10  CFR  51.70(b)  (TN250),  the  NRC  is  required  to  independently  evaluate 
and  be  responsible  for  the  reliability  of  all  information  used  in  the  environmental  review  for  a  CP

Introduction 


or  COL  application,  and  the  NRC  staff  may  (1 )  inquire  into  the  continued  validity  of  information 
disclosed  in  an  ESP  EIS  that  is  referenced  in  a  COL  application  and  (2)  look  for  any  new  and 
potentially  significant  information  that  may  affect  the  assumptions,  analyses,  or  conclusions 
reached  in  an  ESP  EIS. 

In  addition,  measures  and  controls  to  limit  any  adverse  impact  will  be  identified  and  evaluated 
for  feasibility  and  adequacy  in  limiting  adverse  impacts  at  the  ESP  stage,  where  possible,  and  at 
the  CP  or  COL  stage.  As  a  result  of  the  NRC  staff  s  environmental  review  of  the  ESP 
application,  the  NRC  staff  may  determine  that  conditions  or  limitations  on  the  ESP  may  be 
necessary  in  specific  areas,  as  set  forth  in  10  CFR  52.24  (TN251).  Therefore,  the  NRC  staff 
identified  in  this  EIS  when  and  how  assumptions  and  PPE  values  limit  its  conclusions  on  the 
environmental  impacts  to  a  particular  resource  (see  Appendix  J). 

Following  requirements  set  forth  in  10  CFR  Part  51  (TN250)  and  the  guidance  in  RS-002 
(NRC  2004-TN2219),  the  NRC  environmental  staff  (and  technical  experts  from  Oak  Ridge 
National  Laboratory,  Argonne  National  Laboratory,  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory,  and  Pacific 
Northwest  National  Laboratory  retained  to  assist  the  NRC  staff)  visited  the  alternative  sites  in 
April  2012  and  the  PSEG  Site  in  May  2012  to  gather  information  and  to  become  familiar  with  the 
sites  and  their  environs.  During  these  site  visits,  the  NRC  staff  and  its  contractor  personnel  met 
with  the  applicant’s  staff,  public  officials,  Federal  and  State  regulators,  local  officials,  and  the 
public.  A  list  of  the  organizations  contacted  is  provided  in  Appendix  B.  Other  documents 
related  to  the  PSEG  ESP  application  were  reviewed  and  are  listed  as  references  where 
appropriate. 

Upon  acceptance  of  the  PSEG  ESP  application  for  docketing,  the  NRC  began  the 
environmental  review  process  described  in  10  CFR  Part  51  (TN250)  by  publishing,  in  the 
Federal  Register,  a  Notice  of  Intent  to  prepare  an  EIS  and  conduct  scoping  (75  FR  63521- 
TN1530).  The  NRC  staff  held  two  public  scoping  meetings  on  November  4,  2010  in  Carneys 
Point,  New  Jersey.  Subsequent  to  the  scoping  meetings  and  in  accordance  with  NEPA  (42 
USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661)  and  10  CFR  Part  51  (TN250),  the  NRC  staff  determined  and 
evaluated  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  constructing  and  operating  one  or  two  new 
nuclear  power  plants  at  the  PSEG  Site;  findings  are  in  this  EIS. 

To  guide  its  assessment  of  environmental  impacts  of  a  proposed  action  or  alternative  actions, 
the  NRC  has  established  a  standard  of  significance  for  impacts  using  Council  on  Environmental 
Quality  (CEQ)  guidance  (40  CFR  1508.27  [TN428]).  Using  this  approach,  the  NRC  has 
established  three  significance  levels— SMALL,  MODERATE,  or  LARGE— which  are  defined 
below. 


SMALL  -  Environmental  effects  are  not  detectable  or  are  so  minor  that  they  will  neither 
destabilize  nor  noticeably  alter  any  important  attribute  of  the  resource. 

MODERATE  -  Environmental  effects  are  sufficient  to  alter  noticeably,  but  not  to 
destabilize,  important  attributes  of  the  resource. 

LARGE  -  Environmental  effects  are  clearly  noticeable  and  are  sufficient  to  destabilize 
important  attributes  of  the  resource.

Introduction 


This  EIS  presents  the  NRC  staffs  analysis  that  considers  and  weighs  the  environmental 
impacts  of  the  proposed  action  at  the  PSEG  Site,  including  the  environmental  impacts 
associated  with  construction  and  operation  of  reactors  at  the  site,  the  impacts  of  constructing 
and  operating  reactors  at  alternative  sites,  the  environmental  impacts  of  alternatives  to  granting 
the  ESP,  and  mitigation  measures  available  for  reducing  or  avoiding  adverse  environmental 
effects.  It  also  provides  the  NRC  staffs  recommendation  to  the  Commission  regarding  the 
suitability  of  the  PSEG  Site  for  construction  and  operation  of  reactors  with  characteristics  that 
fall  within  the  PPE. 

1.1.4  USACE  Permit  Application  Review 

The  USACE  is  part  of  the  review  team  that  makes  a  determination  based  on  the  three 
significance  levels  established  by  the  NRC.  However,  the  USACE  independent  Record  of 
Decision  (ROD)  regarding  the  aforementioned  permit  application  will  reference  the  analyses  in 
the  EIS  and  present  any  additional  information  required  by  the  USACE  to  support  its  permit 
decision.  The  USACE  role  as  a  cooperating  agency  in  the  preparation  of  this  EIS  is  to  confirm 
that  the  information  presented  in  the  EIS  is  adequate  to  fulfill  the  requirements  of  the  USACE 
regulations  and  the  404(b)(1 )  Guidelines  (40  CFR  Part  230-TN427)  to  construct  the  preferred 
alternative  identified  in  the  EIS.  The  EIS  is  intended  to  present  information  adequate  to  fulfill  the 
requirements  of  the  USACE  regulations,  the  404(b)(1)  Guidelines  that  contain  the  substantive 
environmental  criteria  used  by  the  USACE  in  evaluating  discharges  of  dredged  or  fill  material 
into  waters  of  the  United  States,  and  the  USACE  public  interest  review  (PIR)  process.  The 
USACE  PIR  will  be  part  of  its  permit  decision  document  and  thus  will  not  be  addressed  in  the 
EIS. 

The  404(b)(1)  Guidelines  stipulate  that  no  discharge  of  dredged  or  fill  material  into  waters  of  the 
United  States  (including  jurisdictional  wetlands)  shall  be  permitted  if  there  is  a  practicable 
alternative  that  would  have  less  adverse  impact  on  the  aquatic  environment  so  long  as  the 
alternative  does  not  have  other  significant  adverse  environmental  consequences.  Even  if  an 
applicant’s  preferred  alternative  is  determined  to  be  the  least  environmentally  damaging 
practicable  alternative  (LEDPA),  the  USACE  must  still  determine  whether  the  LEDPA  is  in  the 
public  interest.  The  USACE  PIR,  described  in  33  CFR  320.4  (TN424),  directs  the  USACE  to 
consider  a  number  of  factors  in  a  balancing  process.  A  permit  will  be  not  be  issued  for  an 
alternative  that  is  not  the  LEDPA,  nor  will  a  permit  be  issued  for  an  activity  that  is  determined  to 
be  contrary  to  the  public  interest. 

In  this  EIS,  the  USACE  evaluates  certain  building  and  maintenance  activities  proposed  in 
waters  of  the  United  States,  including  wetlands  that  would  be  impacted  by  the  proposed  project. 
The  USACE  decision  will  reflect  the  national  concern  for  both  protection  and  use  of  important 
resources.  The  benefit  that  reasonably  may  be  expected  to  accrue  from  the  proposal  must  be 
balanced  against  its  reasonably  foreseeable  detriments.  Public  interest  factors  that  may  be 
relevant  to  the  proposal  will  be  considered  such  as  conservation;  economics;  aesthetics; 
general  environmental  concerns;  wetlands;  historic  and  cultural  resources;  fish  and  wildlife 
values;  flood  hazards;  floodplain  values;  land  use;  navigation;  shore  erosion  and  accretion; 
recreation;  water  supply;  water  quality;  energy  needs;  safety;  food  and  fiber  production;  mineral 
needs;  and  considerations  of  property  ownership,  including  cumulative  impacts  thereof  and,  in 
general,  the  needs  and  welfare  of  the  people.  Evaluation  of  the  impact  on  the  public  interest  will

include  application  of  the  404(b)(1)  Guidelines  promulgated  by  the  EPA  administrator  under 
authority  of  CWA  Section  404(b)  (40  CFR  Part  230-TN427).  The  USACE  will  address  all  of 
these  issues  in  its  permit  decision  document. 

As  part  of  the  USACE  permit  evaluation  process,  and  following  issuance  of  the  draft  EIS,  the 
USACE  released  a  public  notice  to  solicit  comments  from  the  public;  Federal,  State,  and  local 
agencies  and  officials;  Native  American  tribes;  and  other  interested  parties  in  order  to  consider 
and  evaluate  the  impacts  of  the  PSEG  proposed  project  (USACE  2014-TN4319). 

The  USACE  will  not  make  its  permit  decision  on  the  proposed  project  until  it  fully  considers  the 
recommendations  of  the  USACE  staff;  Federal,  State,  and  local  resource  agencies;  and 
members  of  the  public  and  assesses  the  cumulative  impact  of  the  total  project  and  until  the 
following  consultations  and  coordination  efforts  have  been  completed:  Section  106  of  the 
National  Historic  Preservation  Act  (54  USC  300101  et  seq.  -TN4157),  including,  as  appropriate, 
development  and  implementation  of  any  Memorandum  of  Agreement;  Endangered  Species  Act 
of  1973  (16  USC  1531  et  seq.  -TNI 010);  Essential  Fish  Habitat  Assessment  (NOAA  1999- 
TN1845);  state  water-quality  certifications;  and  state  coastal  zone  consistency  determinations. 

1.1.5  Preconstruction  Activities 

In  a  final  rule  dated  October  9,  2007,  “Limited  Work  Authorizations  (LWAs)  for  Nuclear  Power 
Plants”  (72  FR  57416-TN260),  the  Commission  defined  “construction”  (10  CFR  50.10  [TN249] 
and  1 0  CFR  51 .4  [TN250])  to  be  consistent  with  the  NRC’s  jurisdiction  over  activities  having  a 
nexus  to  radiological  health  and  safety  and/or  common  defense  and  security.  Many  of  the 
activities  required  to  build  a  nuclear  power  plant  are  not  part  of  the  NRC  action  to  license  the 
plant.  Activities  associated  with  building  the  plant  that  are  not  within  the  purview  of  the  NRC 
action  are  grouped  under  the  term  “preconstruction.”  Preconstruction  activities  include  clearing 
and  grading,  excavating,  erection  of  support  buildings  and  transmission  lines,  and  other 
associated  activities.  These  preconstruction  activities  may  take  place  before  the  application  for 
a  COL  is  submitted,  during  the  NRC  staff  review  of  a  COL  application,  or  after  a  COL  is  granted. 
Although  preconstruction  activities  are  outside  the  NRC  regulatory  authority,  nearly  all  of  them 
are  within  the  regulatory  authority  of  local,  State,  or  other  Federal  agencies. 

Because  the  preconstruction  activities  are  not  part  of  the  NRC  action,  their  impacts  are  not 
reviewed  as  a  direct  effect  of  the  NRC  action.  Rather,  the  impacts  of  the  preconstruction 
activities  are  considered  in  the  context  of  cumulative  impacts.  In  addition,  certain 
preconstruction  activities  involve  placing  structures  and  performing  work  in  and  under  navigable 
waters  and  discharging  dredged  and/or  fill  material  into  waters  of  the  United  States  (including 
jurisdictional  wetlands)  and  require  permits  from  the  USACE.  Such  activities  are  viewed  by  the 
USACE  as  direct  effects  related  to  its  Federal  permitting  action.  Chapter  4  of  this  EIS  describes 
the  relative  magnitude  of  impacts  related  to  construction  and  preconstruction  activities. 

1.1.6  Cooperating  Agencies 

NEPA  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661)  lays  the  groundwork  for  coordination  between  the  lead 
agency  preparing  an  EIS  and  other  Federal  agencies  that  may  have  special  expertise  regarding 
an  environmental  issue  or  jurisdiction  by  law.  These  other  agencies  are  referred  to  as 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Introduction 


“cooperating  agencies.”  Cooperating  agencies  have  the  responsibility  to  assist  the  lead  agency 
through  early  participation  in  the  NEPA  process,  including  scoping;  by  providing  technical  input 
to  the  environmental  analysis;  and  by  making  staff  support  available  as  needed  by  the  lead 
agency. 

Most  proposed  nuclear  power  plants  require  a  permit  from  the  USACE,  where  impacts  are 
proposed  to  waters  of  the  United  States,  in  addition  to  a  license  from  the  NRC.  Therefore,  the 
NRC  and  the  USACE  decided  the  most  effective  and  efficient  use  of  Federal  resources  in  the 
review  of  nuclear  power  projects  would  be  achieved  by  a  cooperative  agreement.  On 
September  12,  2008,  the  NRC  and  the  USACE  signed  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU) 
regarding  the  review  of  nuclear  power  plant  license  applications  (USACE  and  NRC  2008- 
TN637).  On  June  24,  201 1 ,  the  USACE  Philadelphia  District  agreed  by  letter  (USACE  2011- 
TN3305)  to  become  a  cooperating  agency  as  defined  in  10  CFR  51.14  (TN250). 

As  described  in  the  MOU,  the  NRC  is  the  lead  Federal  agency  and  the  USACE  is  a  cooperating 
agency  in  the  development  of  the  EIS.  Under  Federal  law,  each  agency  has  jurisdiction  related 
to  portions  of  the  proposed  project  as  major  Federal  actions  that  could  significantly  affect  the 
quality  of  the  human  environment.  The  goal  of  this  cooperative  agreement  is  the  development 
of  one  EIS  that  serves  the  needs  of  the  NRC  license  decision  process  and  the  USACE  DA 
permit  decision  process.  While  both  agencies  must  comply  with  the  requirements  of  NEPA 
(42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661),  both  agencies  also  have  independent  or  individual  mission 
requirements  that  must  be  met.  The  NRC  makes  license  decisions  under  the  Atomic  Energy 
Act  of  1954,  as  amended  (42  USC  201 1  et  seq.  -TN663),  and  the  USACE  makes  permit 
decisions  under  RHAA  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  -TN660)  and  CWA  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662). 
The  USACE  is  cooperating  with  the  NRC  to  ensure  that  the  information  presented  in  the  NEPA 
documentation  is  adequate  to  fulfill  the  requirements  of  the  USACE  regulations;  the  404(b)(1) 
Guidelines  (40  CFR  Part  230-TN427),  which  contain  the  substantive  environmental  criteria  used 
by  the  USACE  in  evaluating  discharges  of  dredged  or  fill  material  into  waters  of  the  United 
States;  and  the  USACE  PIR  process. 

As  a  cooperating  agency,  the  USACE  is  part  of  the  NRC  review  team  and  is  involved  in  all 
aspects  of  the  environmental  review,  including  scoping,  public  meetings,  public  comment 
resolution,  and  EIS  preparation.  The  NRC  public  meeting  with  the  USACE  serves  the  dual 
purpose  of  both  agencies,  with  the  USACE  referring  to  the  NRC-defined  public  meeting  as  its 
public  hearing.  The  USACE  district  engineer  or  designee  may  participate  in  joint  public 
hearings  with  other  Federal  or  State  agencies  in  accordance  with  33  CFR  Part  327  (TNI 788) 
provided  the  procedures  of  those  hearings  meet  the  requirements  of  this  regulation.  In  those 
cases  in  which  the  other  Federal  or  State  agency  allows  a  cross-examination  in  its  public 
hearing,  the  district  engineer  may  still  participate  in  the  joint  public  hearing  but  shall  not  require 
cross-examination  as  a  part  of  his  participation. 

The  USACE  refers  to  public  meetings  to  acquire  information  or  evidence  that  will  be  considered 
in  evaluating  a  proposed  DA  permit  as  hearings,  but  there  is  no  adjudicatory  process  involved 
such  as  the  NRC  hearings  conducted  by  the  Atomic  Safety  and  Licensing  Board.  For  the 
purposes  of  assessment  of  environmental  impact  under  NEPA  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661 ), 
the  EIS  uses  the  SMALL/MODERATE/LARGE  criteria  discussed  in  Section  1.1.3  of  this  EIS; 
this  approach  has  been  vetted  by  the  CEQ.

Introduction 


A  cooperating  agency  may  adopt  the  EIS  of  a  lead  Federal  agency  without  recirculating  it  when 
the  cooperating  agency  concludes,  after  an  independent  review  of  the  EIS,  that  its  comments 
and  suggestions  have  been  satisfied  and  issues  an  ROD.  The  goal  of  the  process  is  that  the 
USACE  will  have  all  the  information  necessary  to  make  a  permit  decision  when  the  final  EIS  is 
issued.  However,  it  is  possible  the  USACE  may  still  need  some  information  from  the  applicant 
to  complete  the  permit  documentation — information  that  the  applicant  could  not  make  available 
by  the  time  of  final  EIS  issuance.  Also,  any  conditions  required  by  the  USACE,  such  as 
compensatory  mitigation,  will  be  addressed  in  the  USACE  permit  (if  issued).  Compensation 
may  only  be  used  after  all  appropriate  and  practical  steps  to  avoid  and  minimize  adverse 
impacts  to  aquatic  resources,  including  wetlands  and  streams,  have  been  taken.  All  remaining 
unavoidable  impacts  must  be  compensated  to  the  extent  appropriate  and  practicable.  The 
USACE  permit,  if  issued,  would  include  special  conditions  to  the  effect  that  PSEG  must  confirm 
that  any  wetland  compensation  efforts  have  achieved  their  established  goals  and  requirements 
in  accordance  with  Compensatory  Mitigation  for  Losses  of  Aquatic  Resources,  Final  Rule 
([73  FR  19594-TN1789]  and  33  CFR  Parts  325  [TN425]  and  332  [TNI 472]). 

1.1.7  Concurrent  NRC  Reviews 

In  reviews  that  are  separate  from,  but  parallel  to,  the  EIS  process,  the  NRC  analyzes  the  safety 
characteristics  of  the  proposed  site  and  emergency  planning  information.  These  analyses  are 
documented  in  an  SER  (NRC  2015-TN4369)  issued  by  the  NRC  in  September  2015.  The  SER 
presents  the  conclusions  reached  by  the  NRC  regarding  (1)  whether  there  is  reasonable 
assurance  that  a  reactor  or  reactors,  having  characteristics  that  fall  within  the  parameters  for  the 
site,  can  be  constructed  and  operated  without  undue  risk  to  the  health  and  safety  of  the  public; 
(2)  whether  the  emergency  preparedness  program  meets  the  applicable  requirements  in  10 
CFR  Part  50  (TN249),  10  CFR  Part  52  (TN251),  10  CFR  Part  73  (TN423),  and  10  CFR  Part  100 
(TN282);  and  (3)  whether  site  characteristics  are  such  that  adequate  security  plans  and 
measures  as  referenced  in  the  above  regulations  can  be  developed. 

1.2  The  Proposed  Federal  Actions 

The  proposed  NRC  Federal  action  is  the  issuance,  under  the  provisions  of  10  CFR  Part  52 
(TN251 ),  of  an  ESP  for  the  PSEG  Site  for  approval  of  a  site  suitable  for  constructing  and 
operating  nuclear  power  facilities  that  fall  within  the  PPE  described  in  the  PSEG  ESP 
application  that  would  be  operated  as  a  merchant  plant  to  supply  baseload  electrical  power  to 
the  State  of  New  Jersey  and  to  the  PJM  Interconnection,  LLC  grid.  The  proposed  USACE 
Federal  action  is  a  permit  decision  on  a  DA  permit  application  pursuant  to  CWA  Section  404 
(33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  and  RHAA  Section  10  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  -TN660).  While 
PSEG  is  not  proposing  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  under  the  ESP 
application,  this  EIS  provides  the  NRC  and  USACE  analyses  of  the  environmental  impacts  that 
could  result  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  or  at  one 
of  four  alternative  sites.  These  impacts  are  analyzed  by  the  USACE  to  determine  whether  the 
proposed  site  is  the  LEDPA  that  would  meet  the  project  purpose  and  need.  These  impacts  are 
also  analyzed  by  the  NRC  to  determine  whether  there  is  an  alternative  site  that  is  obviously 
superior  to  the  proposed  site.

Introduction 


The  proposed  PSEG  Site  is  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS  on  the  southern 
part  of  Artificial  Island  on  the  east  bank  of  the  Delaware  River.  Of  the  819-ac  PSEG  Site,  PSEG 
owns  734  ac  as  part  of  the  existing  HCGS/SGS  site.  PSEG  developed  an  agreement  in 
principle  with  the  USACE  to  acquire  through  a  land  exchange  an  additional  85  ac  of  the  USACE 
Artificial  Island  Confined  Disposal  Facility  (CDF)  land  immediately  north  of  HCGS.  In  addition, 
during  plant  construction,  PSEG  would  temporarily  lease  from  the  USACE  45  ac  of  the  CDF 
land  north  of  the  proposed  site  as  the  location  of  the  concrete  batch  plant  and  a  construction 
laydown  area.  In  this  EIS,  the  proposed  land  exchange  and  land  lease  are  addressed  to  the 
extent  that  actions  resulting  from  the  exchange  or  the  lease  would  have  direct  impacts  on  the 
proposed  PSEG  Site  (i.e.,  from  the  long-term  use  of  85  ac  and  the  temporary  use  of  45  ac  to 
construct  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  Artificial  Island).*1) 

For  purposes  of  the  ESP  application,  PSEG  has  not  yet  selected  a  specific  reactor  technology. 
PSEG  developed  its  PPE  using  parameters  from  the  following  four  reactor  technologies. 

•  Advanced  Passive  1000  (API  000)  (two  units), 

•  U.S.  Evolutionary  Power  Reactor  (U.S.  EPR)  (one  unit), 

•  Advanced  Boiling  Water  Reactor  (ABWR)  (one  unit), 

•  U.S.  Advanced  Pressurized  Water  Reactor  (US-APWR)  (one  unit). 

This  EIS  analyzes  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  PPE  surrogate  reactor  at  the  proposed 
PSEG  Site.  Chapter  3  of  this  EIS  provides  detailed  information  about  the  site  layout  and  PPE 
selected  by  PSEG. 

1 .3  The  Purpose  and  Need  for  the  Proposed  Actions 

The  purpose  and  need  for  the  proposed  NRC  and  USACE  actions  is  described  below. 

1.3.1  NRC  Proposed  Action 

The  purpose  and  need  for  the  NRC  proposed  action  (i.e.,  ESP  issuance)  is  to  provide  for  early 
resolution  of  site  safety  and  environmental  issues,  which  provides  stability  in  the  licensing 
process.  Although  no  reactor  would  be  built  at  the  PSEG  Site  under  this  action  (the  ESP),  to 
resolve  environmental  issues  the  staff  assumed  in  this  EIS  that  a  reactor  with  the  parameters 
specified  in  the  PPE  would  be  built  and  operated.  One  of  the  issues  addressed  by  this  EIS  is 
the  projected  shortfall  in  baseload  capacity  within  the  State  of  New  Jersey  in  2021 .  The  ESP 
would  resolve  site  suitability  issues  related  to  the  building  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  that  would  provide  up  to  2,200  MW  of  new  baseload  capacity.  This  would  meet  a  portion 
of  the  expected  2021  power  deficit.  In  the  absence  of  an  ESP,  safety  and  environmental 
reviews  of  applications  for  OLs  under  10  CFR  Part  50  (TN249)  would  take  place  during  plant 
construction.  Alternatively,  ail  safety  and  environmental  issues  would  have  to  be  addressed  at 
the  time  of  the  NRC  staff  review  of  a  COL  submitted  under  1 0  CFR  Part  52  (TN251 )  if  no  ESP 
for  the  site  were  referenced.  Although  actual  construction  and  operation  of  the  facility  would  not 


(1 )  The  USACE  is  conducting  a  separate  NEPA  analysis  for  the  proposed  land  exchange  and  land  lease 
agreements  with  PSEG.  Cumulative  impacts  between  the  PSEG  proposed  project  and  the 
exchanged  land,  if  any,  will  be  addressed  in  Chapter  7  of  this  EIS.

Introduction 


take  place  unless  and  until  a  COL  were  granted,  certain  lead-time  activities,  such  as  ordering 
and  procuring  certain  components  and  materials  necessary  to  construct  the  plant,  may  begin 
before  the  COL  is  granted.  As  a  result,  without  the  ESP  review  process  there  could  be  a 
considerable  expenditure  of  funds,  commitment  of  resources,  and  passage  of  time  before  site 
safety  and  environmental  issues  are  finally  resolved. 

1.3.2  The  USACE  Permit  Action 

The  PSEG  permit  application  to  the  USACE  is  for  work  needed  to  prepare  the  PSEG  Site  for  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant.  As  part  of  the  evaluation  of  permit  applications  subject  to  CWA 
Section  404  (33  USC  1251  et  seq  -TN662),  the  USACE  must  define  the  overall  project  purpose 
in  addition  to  the  basic  project  purpose.  The  overall  project  purpose  establishes  the  scope  of 
the  alternatives  analysis  and  is  used  for  evaluating  practicable  alternatives  under  the  404(b)(1 ) 
Guidelines  (40  CFR  Part  230-TN427).  In  accordance  with  the  guidelines  and  the  USACE 
headquarters  guidance,  the  overall  project  purpose  must  be  specific  enough  to  define  the 
applicant’s  needs  but  not  so  narrow  and  restrictive  as  to  preclude  a  proper  evaluation  of 
alternatives.  The  USACE  is  responsible  for  controlling  every  aspect  of  the  404(b)(1)  Guidelines 
(40  CFR  Part  230-TN427)  analysis.  In  this  regard,  defining  the  overall  project  purpose  is  the 
sole  responsibility  of  the  USACE.  While  generally  focusing  on  the  applicant’s  statement,  the 
USACE  will,  in  all  cases,  exercise  independent  judgment  in  defining  the  purpose  and  need  for 
the  project  from  both  the  applicant’s  alternatives  and  the  public’s  perspective  (33  CFR  Part  325 
Appendix  B  (9)(c)(4)  [TN425]— see  also  33  CFR  Part  230  [TN2273]). 

Where  the  activity  associated  with  a  discharge  is  proposed  for  a  special  aquatic  site  (as  defined 
in  the  404(b)(1)  Guidelines,  40  CFR  Part  230,  Subpart  E  [TN427])  and  does  not  require  access 
or  proximity  to  or  siting  within  these  types  of  areas  to  fulfill  its  basic  project  purpose  (i.e.,  the 
project  is  not  “water  dependent”),  practicable  alternatives  that  avoid  special  aquatic  sites  are 
presumed  to  be  available  unless  clearly  demonstrated  otherwise  (404(b)(1)  Guidelines,  40  CFR 
230.10(a)(3)  [TN427]).  The  basic  purpose  for  the  PSEG  project  is  to  conduct  work  associated 
with  building  a  power  plant  to  generate  electricity  for  additional  baseload  capacity. 

Section  230.10(a)  of  the  404(b)(1)  Guidelines  (40  CFR  Part  230-TN427)  requires  that  “no 
discharge  of  dredged  or  fill  material  shall  be  permitted  if  there  is  a  practicable  alternative  to  the 
proposed  discharge  which  would  have  less  adverse  impact  on  the  aquatic  ecosystem,  so  long 
as  the  alternative  does  not  have  other  significant  adverse  environmental  consequences.” 
Section  230.10(a)(2)  of  the  404(b)(1)  Guidelines  states  that  “an  alternative  is  practicable  if  it  is 
available  and  capable  of  being  done  after  taking  into  consideration  cost,  existing  technology, 
and  logistics  in  light  of  overall  project  purposes.  If  it  is  otherwise  a  practicable  alternative,  an 
area  not  presently  owned  by  the  applicant  that  could  reasonably  be  obtained,  used,  expanded, 
or  managed  to  fulfill  the  basic  purpose  of  the  proposed  activity  may  be  considered.”  Thus,  this 
analysis  is  necessary  to  determine  which  alternative  is  the  LEDPA  that  meets  the  project 
purpose  and  need.  The  overall  purpose  of  the  project  is  to  construct  a  nuclear  power  plant 
facility  to  provide  for  additional  baseload  electrical  generating  capacity  to  meet  the  growing 
demand  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey.

Introduction 


1 .4  Alternatives  to  the  Proposed  Actions 

NEPA  Section  102(2)(C)(iii)  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661)  states  that  EISs  will  include  a 
detailed  statement  on  alternatives  to  the  proposed  action.  The  NRC  regulations  for 
implementing  Section  102(2)  of  NEPA  provide  for  inclusion  of  a  chapter  in  an  EIS  that  discusses 
the  environmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  action  and  the  alternatives  (10  CFR  Part  51,  Subpart 
A,  Appendix  A  [TN250]).  Chapter  9  of  this  EIS  discusses  the  environmental  impacts  of  four 
categories  of  alternatives:  (1 )  the  no-action  alternative,  (2)  energy  alternatives,  (3)  alternative 
sites,  and  (4)  system  design  alternatives. 

In  the  no-action  alternative,  the  action  would  not  go  forward.  The  NRC  could  deny  the  PSEG 
request  for  an  ESP.  The  no-action  or  permit  denial  alternative  also  is  available  to  the  USACE. 
The  no-action  alternative  is  one  which  results  in  no  activities  requiring  a  USACE  permit.  It  may 
be  brought  by  (1 )  the  applicant  electing  to  modify  his  proposal  to  eliminate  work  under  the 
jurisdiction  of  the  USACE  or  (2)  the  denial  of  the  permit.  If  the  request  and/or  permit  were 
denied,  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site 
in  accordance  with  the  10  CFR  Part  52  (TN251)  process  referencing  an  approved  ESP  would 
not  occur,  nor  would  any  benefits  intended  by  the  approved  ESP  be  realized. 

The  discussion  of  energy  alternatives  focuses  on  those  sources  of  energy  that  could  meet  the 
purpose  and  need  of  the  project  to  generate  baseload  power. 

The  four  alternative  sites  considered  in  detail  in  this  EIS  include  Site  4-1  in  Hunterdon  County, 
New  Jersey;  Sites  7-1  and  7-2  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey;  and  Site  7-3  in  Cumberland 
County,  New  Jersey.  Chapter  9  also  includes  sections  discussing  (1)  the  PSEG  region  of 
interest  for  identification  of  alternative  plant  sites,  (2)  the  methods  used  by  PSEG  to  select  the 
proposed  site  and  alternative  sites,  and  (3)  generic  issues  that  are  consistent  among  the 
alternative  sites.  Chapter  9  compares  the  environmental  impacts  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  to 
those  at  the  alternative  sites  and  qualitatively  determines  whether  any  of  those  alternative  sites 
is  obviously  superior  to  the  proposed  site. 

System  design  alternatives  include  heat  dissipation  and  circulating  water  systems,  intake  and 
discharge  structures,  and  water  use  and  treatment  systems.  Finally,  the  USACE  will  continue  to 
review  additional  efforts  to  avoid  and  minimize  potential  impacts  to  waters  of  the  United  States, 
including  wetlands  and  cultural  and  natural  resources  on  the  site. 

As  part  of  the  evaluation  of  permit  applications  subject  to  CWA  Section  404  (33  USC  1251  et 
seq.  -TN662),  the  USACE  is  required  by  regulation  to  apply  the  criteria  set  forth  in  the  404(b)(1) 
Guidelines  (40  CFR  Part  230-TN427).  These  guidelines  establish  criteria  that  must  be  met  for 
the  proposed  activities  to  be  permitted  pursuant  to  Section  404.  Specifically,  the  guidelines 
state,  in  part,  that  no  discharge  of  dredged  or  fill  material  shall  be  permitted  if  there  is  a 
practicable  alternative  to  the  proposed  discharge  that  would  have  less  adverse  impacts  on  the 
aquatic  ecosystem  provided  the  alternative  does  not  have  other  significant  adverse 
consequences  (40  CFR  230.10(a)  [TN427]).  If  it  is  otherwise  a  practicable  alternative,  an  area 
not  presently  owned  by  the  applicant  that  could  reasonably  be  obtained,  used,  expanded,  or 
managed  to  fulfill  the  basic  purpose  of  the  proposed  activity  may  be  considered.

Introduction 


1.5  Compliance  and  Consultations 

Before  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  reactor  or  reactors,  PSEG  is  required  to  hold  certain 
Federal,  State,  and  local  environmental  permits  and  meet  relevant  Federal  and  State  statutory 
requirements.  In  its  ER,  PSEG  provided  a  list  of  environmental  approvals  and  consultations 
associated  with  the  ESP.  Because  an  ESP  is  limited  to  establishing  the  acceptability  of  the 
proposed  site  for  future  development  of  a  nuclear  power  facility  a  number  of  authorizations 
PSEG  will  need  from  Federal,  State,  and  local  authorities  for  construction  and  operation  are  not 
yet  necessary. 

Concurrent  with  its  filing  of  the  ESP  application  to  the  NRC,  PSEG  filed  an  application  for  a 
Coastal  Zone  Management  Act  (16  USC  1451  et  seq.  -TN1243)  consistency  determination  from 
the  State  of  New  Jersey.  On  July  13,  2010,  the  NJDEP  Division  of  Land  Use  Regulation  issued 
its  determination  that  the  PSEG  ESP  application  is  consistent  with  the  New  Jersey  Rules  on 
Coastal  Zone  Management  (NJAC  7:7E-TN2272)  with  one  condition: 

"As  proposed,  the  project  will  require  a  CAFRA  Individual  Permit,  Coastal  Wetlands  Permit, 
Waterfront  Development  Permit  and  Freshwater  Wetlands  Individual  Permit  from  the 
Division.  These  permits  must  be  obtained  prior  to  any  construction  activities  on  the  site 
related  to  the  project  described  above”  (NJDEP  2010-TN235). 

PSEG  has  not  filed  an  application  for  a  CWA  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  Section  401 
certification  from  the  State  of  New  Jersey. 

The  NRC  staff  considered  the  necessary  authorizations  and  consultations  and  contacted  the 
appropriate  Federal,  State,  and  local  agencies  to  identify  any  compliance,  permit,  or  significant 
environmental  issues  of  concern  to  the  reviewing  agencies  that  may  impact  the  suitability  of  the 
PSEG  Site  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  reactors  that  fall  within  the  PPE. 

1.6  Report  Contents 

The  subsequent  chapters  of  this  EIS  are  organized  as  follows.  Chapter  2  describes  the 
proposed  site  and  discusses  the  environment  that  would  be  affected  by  the  addition  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant.  Chapter  3  examines  the  power  plant  characteristics  to  be  used  as  the 
basis  for  evaluation  of  the  environmental  impacts.  Chapters  4  and  5  examine  site  suitability  by 
analyzing  the  environmental  impacts  of  construction  (Chapter  4)  and  operation  (Chapter  5)  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant.  Chapter  6  analyzes  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  fuel  cycle, 
transportation  of  radioactive  materials,  and  decommissioning,  while  Chapter  7  discusses  the 
cumulative  impacts  of  the  proposed  action.  Chapter  8  discusses  the  need  for  power  from  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant.  Chapter  9  discusses  alternatives  to  the  proposed  action;  analyzes  energy 
sources,  alternative  sites,  and  systems  design;  and  compares  the  proposed  action  with  the 
alternatives.  Chapter  10  summarizes  the  findings  of  the  preceding  chapters  and  presents  the 
NRC  staffs  conclusions  and  recommendations  with  respect  to  Commission  approval  of  the 
proposed  site  for  an  ESP  based  on  the  NRC  staffs  evaluation  of  environmental  impacts.

2.0  AFFECTED  ENVIRONMENT 


The  site  proposed  by  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG),  for  an  early  site 
permit  (ESP)  and  a  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  action  on  a  U.S.  Department  of  the 
Army  (DA)  permit  is  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  (HCGS) 
and  Salem  Generating  Station  (SGS)  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township.  Salem  County,  New 
Jersey  (Figure  2-1).  The  proposed  site  location  is  described  in  Section  2.1,  followed  by 
descriptions  of  site  land  use.  water,  ecology,  socioeconomics,  environmental  justice,  historic 
and  cultural  resources,  geology,  meteorology  and  air  quality,  and  nonradiological  health,  and 
radiological  environment  in  Sections  2.2  through  2.11,  respectively.  Section  2.12  discusses 
related  Federal  projects. 

2.1  Site  Location 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek 
Township.  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  Artificial  Island  was  formed  from  dredge  spoils 
produced  as  a  result  of  maintenance  dredging  of  the  Delaware  River  navigation  channel  by  the 
USACE.  The  site  is  approximately  7  mi  east  of  Middletown,  Delaware;  7.5  mi  southwest  of 
Salem,  New  Jersey;  and  9  mi  south  of  Pennsville.  New  Jersey.  Figure  2-1  depicts  the  location 
of  the  PSEG  Site  in  relationship  to  nearby  counties  and  cities  within  the  context  of  the 
50-mi  region  and  the  6-mi  vicinity. 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  adjacent  to  HCGS  and  SGS  on  the  northwestern  portion  of  the 
existing  PSEG  property.  Figure  2-2  depicts  the  proposed  site  in  relation  to  the  existing  units. 
PSEG  owns  734  ac  of  the  site  and  has  developed  an  agreement  with  the  USACE  to  acquire 
85  ac  immediately  north  of  the  existing  PSEG  property.  Thus,  the  total  PSEG  Site  would 
encompass  819  ac.  Figure  2-3  presents  an  aerial  photograph  of  the  existing  PSEG  property. 
PSEG  calculated  the  center  point  of  a  new  plant  based  on  a  composite  drawing  of  a  surrogate 
plant  derived  from  the  four  reactor  technologies  on  which  PSEG's  plant  parameter  envelope 
(PPE)  is  based: 

•  Latitude:  39°28'23.744"  North 

•  Longitude:  75°32'24. 332"  West 

The  Delaware  River  borders  the  western  and  southern  sides  of  the  existing  PSEG  property. 
Lands  developed  by  the  USACE  as  the  Artificial  Island  Confined  Disposal  Facility  (CDF)  for  the 
placement  of  material  dredged  from  the  Delaware  River  are  located  immediately  north  of  the 
PSEG  property  along  the  east  bank  of  the  river.  Lands  consisting  of  tidal  marsh  are  located  to 
the  north  and  east  of  the  PSEG  property. 

PSEG's  proposed  site  is  located  15  mi  south  of  the  Delaware  Memorial  Bridge  near  Delaware 
River  Mile  (RM)  52  on  the  east  side  of  the  Delaware  River.  The  portion  of  the  river  flowing 
adjacent  to  the  site  is  2.5  mi  wide.  The  site  is  18  mi  south  of  Wilmington,  Delaware,  and  30  mi 
southwest  of  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania.

2.2  Land  Use 

This  section  discusses  existing  land  uses  and  land-related  issues  for  the  PSEG  Site,  including 
the  proposed  location  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Section  2.2.1  describes  land  use  on  the 
site  and  in  the  vicinity,  defined  as  the  area  encompassed  within  a  6-mi  radius  of  the  site. 

Section  2.2.2  discusses  land  use  along  the  existing  transmission  line  corridors  from  the  PSEG 
Site,  the  existing  access  road  corridor  for  the  PSEG  Site,  and  the  proposed  access  road  corridor 
for  the  PSEG  Site.  Section  2.2.3  discusses  land  use  in  the  region,  which  is  defined  as  the  area 
within  50  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site  boundary. 

2.2.1  The  Site  and  Vicinity 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  adjacent  to  HCGS  and  SGS  on  the  northwestern  portion  of  the 
existing  PSEG  property  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey 
(Figure  2-1).  The  site  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  on  the  east  bank  of  the 
Delaware  River.  The  creation  of  Artificial  Island  began  around  1900,  when  the  USACE  began 
disposing  of  hydraulic  dredge  spoils  within  a  diked  area  established  around  a  naturally  occurring 
sandbar  that  projected  into  the  river.  Over  the  years,  the  diked  area  was  enlarged  to 
accommodate  additional  spoils  materials  produced  as  a  result  of  maintenance  dredging  of  the 
Delaware  River  navigation  channel.  As  this  area  was  filled  in  and  enlarged,  it  became  known  as 
Artificial  Island  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Of  the  819-ac  PSEG  Site,  PSEG  owns  734  ac  as  part  of  the  existing  PSEG  property.  PSEG 
has  developed  an  agreement  in  principle  with  the  USACE  to  acquire  an  additional  85  ac  of  the 
USACE  Artificial  Island  CDF  land  immediately  north  of  HCGS  (Figure  2-2).  Therefore,  the 
PSEG  Site  would  total  819  ac.  In  addition,  during  plant  construction,  PSEG  would  temporarily 
lease,  from  the  USACE.  45  ac  of  the  Artificial  Island  CDF  land  north  of  the  PSEG  Site  as  the 
location  of  the  concrete  batch  plant  and  a  construction/laydown  area.  At  the  completion  of 
construction,  PSEG  would  return  the  45  ac  of  leased  land  to  the  USACE,  subject  to  any 
required  long-term  exclusion  area  boundary  (EAB)  control  conditions  from  the  NRC.  The  lands 
to  be  acquired  and  leased  by  PSEG  from  the  USACE  are  currently  part  of  the  350-ac  Artificial 
Island  CDF  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Of  the  existing  734-ac  PSEG  property,  a  total  of  373  ac  is  used  for  HCGS  (153  ac)  and  SGS 
(220  ac).  The  remaining  361  ac  is  composed  of  developed  upland  areas  in  industrial  use,  a 
variety  of  wetland  types,  and  maintained  stormwater  management  facilities  (e.g.,  swales  and 
detention  basins).  Much  of  this  land  previously  has  been  developed  and  disturbed  for  various 
power  plant  uses.  The  elevation  of  the  terrain  across  the  PSEG  Site  generally  ranges  from  5  to 
15  ft  North  American  Vertical  Datum  1988  (NAVD88),  and  developed  areas  of  the  site  are 
nominally  10  to  12  ft  NAVD88  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  HCGS  is  a  single-unit  boiling  water 
reactor  (BWR)  with  a  current  licensed  thermal  power  of  3,840  MW(t).  SGS  has  two  pressurized 
water  reactors  (PWR),  each  with  a  current  licensed  thermal  power  of  3,459  MW(t).  An  access 
road  connects  the  existing  PSEG  property  to  a  secondary  road  3.6  mi  to  the  east.  The  existing 
PSEG  property  can  also  be  accessed  from  the  Delaware  River;  barge  access  points  for  SGS 
and  HCGS  are  located  at  the  southern  end  and  western  side  of  Artificial  Island,  respectively 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).

Affected  Environment 


According  to  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP)  land  use  and 
land  cover  (LULC)  data  cited  by  PSEG  (2014-TN3281 ),  major  land  uses  within  the  PSEG 
property  boundary  include  industrial,  Ptog/77/tes-dominated  coastal  and  interior  wetlands,  old 
field,  other  urban  or  built-up,  Phragmites- dominated  old  field,  and  undeveloped  rights-of-way 
(ROWs).  Figure  2-4  and  Figure  2-5  present  the  types  and  distribution  of  land  use  on  and 
around  the  existing  PSEG  property,  and  Table  2-1  lists  the  area  for  each  land-use  category 
within  the  819-ac  PSEG  Site.  Dominant  land  uses  on  the  existing  PSEG  property  are  urban  or 
built  up  lands  that  include  the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  facilities  and  wetlands  dominated  by 
monotypic  populations  of  common  reed  ( Phragmites  australis ).  These  dominant  land  uses 
include  industrial  (31.9  percent),  Phragmites-6om\r\a\e6  coastal  wetlands  (17.3  percent),  and 
Phragmites- dominated  interior  wetlands  (12.9  percent).  Old  field  land  and  other  urban  or  built- 
up  land  account  for  9.5  and  7.0  percent  of  the  PSEG  property,  respectively.  The  remaining 
property  includes  altered  lands,  artificial  lakes,  deciduous  brush/shrubland,  deciduous 
scrub/shrub  and  herbaceous  wetlands,  disturbed  wetlands,  recreation  land,  tidal-related  lands, 
transportation/communication/utilities,  wetland  and  upland  ROWs,  Phragmites- dominated  urban 
areas  and  old  field,  and  managed  wetland  in  maintained  lawn  greenspace  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3281 ). 

Most  of  the  PSEG  Site  lies  within  the  current  PSEG  property  boundary.  However,  as  discussed 
above,  PSEG  would  acquire  additional  land  (85  ac)  north  of  HCGS  for  locating  permanent  plant 
facilities,  and  would  lease  additional  land  (45  ac)  north  of  HCGS  for  locating  temporary 
construction  support  facilities.  Of  the  85  ac  to  be  acquired  for  permanent  plant  facilities,  50  ac 
are  now  part  of  the  USACE  Artificial  Island  CDF  and  35  ac  are  now  part  of  an  adjoining  coastal 
marsh.  All  of  the  45  ac  to  be  leased  are  part  of  the  Artificial  Island  CDF  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

NJDEP  LULC  data  indicate  the  85-ac  parcel  to  be  acquired  by  PSEG  is  composed  primarily  of 
Phragmites-6 o m i n ated  coastal  and  interior  wetlands  (61.1  percent),  artificial  lakes 
(30.8  percent),  and  other  urban  or  built-up  lands  (5.5  percent),  as  seen  in  Table  2-1 
(PSEG  2014-TN3281 ).  The  45-ac  parcel  to  be  leased  by  PSEG  is  composed  primarily  of 
disturbed  and  Phragmites-6om\r\aie6  coastal  and  interior  wetlands  (91.1  percent)  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  The  entire  area  to  be  acquired  and  leased  is  highly  disturbed,  consisting  of 
unvegetated  sand  and  Phragmites-tiominateti  vegetation  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  actual 
acreage  of  wetland  habitat  and  open  water  within  the  existing  CDFs  at  Artificial  Island  may 
change  because  of  ongoing  dredge  disposal  operations. 

Activities  including  the  discharge  of  dredge  or  fill  materials  into  waters  of  the  United  States, 
including  wetlands,  require  permit  authorization  from  the  USACE  under  Section  404  of  the 
Clean  Water  Act  (CWA)  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662).  Additionally,  the  USACE  regulates  any 
work  or  structures  affecting  waters  of  the  United  States,  including  wetlands,  under  Section  10  of 
the  Rivers  and  Harbors  Appropriation  Act  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  -TN660).  NJDEP  regulates 
coastal  wetlands  under  the  New  Jersey  Wetlands  Act  of  1970  (NJSA  13:9A  et  seq.  -TN3361 ), 
and  freshwater  wetlands  are  regulated  under  the  New  Jersey  Freshwater  Wetlands  Protection 
Act  (NJAC  7:7A-TH4284)(PSEG  2012-TN2389).

PSEG  submitted  an  application  for  a  line  verification  letter  of  interpretation  (LOI)  to  NJDEP  for 
the  PSEG  Site.  Additionally,  PSEG  submitted  a  Jurisdictional  Determination  Request  to  the 
USACE  to  clarify  the  USACE’s  jurisdiction  on  the  USACE’s  85-ac  CDF  facility  immediately  north 
of  the  PSEG  Site.  As  part  of  their  request,  PSEG  submitted  results  of  jurisdictional  wetland 
delineation  conducted  in  accordance  with  procedures  identified  in  the  Federal  Manual  for 
Identifying  and  Delineating  Jurisdictional  Wetlands  (USACE  et  al.  1989-TN4285)  and  Corps  of 
Engineers  Wetland  Delineation  Manual  (USACE  1987-TN2066)  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Freshwater 
wetland  complexes  were  identified,  flagged,  and  surveyed.  Hydrophytic  vegetation,  hydric  soils, 
and  wetland  hydrology  were  identified  and  described  at  each  of  the  data  collection  points. 
Additionally,  PSEG  submitted  a  description  of  the  85-ac  CDF  facility  along  with  interpretation  of 
USACE  Regulatory  Guidance  and  descriptions  of  the  CDF  hydrology,  hydrophytic  vegetation, 
and  hydric  soil  to  support  wetland  determination  (PSEG  2012-TN2389). 


A  total  of  39  Federal  jurisdictional  freshwater  wetland  units  covering  approximately  1 58.7  ac 
were  identified  by  the  USACE  in  a  letter  dated  February  24,  2014,  to  PSEG  (USACE  2014- 
TN3282).  These  areas  were  identified  as  Block  26,  lots  2,  4,  4.01 ,  5,  and  5.01  in  Lower 
Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  Any  proposal  to  perform  work,  build 
structures,  or  discharge  dredge  or  fill  material  into  the  identified  areas  would  require  prior 
approval  from  the  Philadelphia  District  Corps  of  Engineers.  Figure  2-6  depicts  the  jurisdictional 
wetlands  (considered  important  terrestrial  habitat)  on  the  PSEG  Site.  The  printed  version  of  this 
figure  may  not  be  legible;  however,  the  electronic  version  is  viewable  when  zoomed  in. 

Figure  2-6  includes  wetlands  mapped  by  NJDEP  (coastal  wetlands)  and  those  delineated  on  the 
site  as  part  of  the  site  (e.g.,  USACE  CDF  facility,  PSEG  desilt  basin,  and  freshwater  wetlands). 

A  total  of  1 64.9  ac  of  coastal  wetlands  and  1 58.68  ac  of  freshwater  wetlands  have  been 


mapped  on  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  USACE  2014-TN3282).  The  39  Federal 
jurisdictional  freshwater  wetland  units  were  individually  identified  as  Al ,  AA,  B1 ,  BB,  CC,  CDF3, 
D,  D1 ,  Dla,  Dlb,  Die,  Did,  DD,  E,  F,  FI,  G,  G1,  H,  HI,  I,  II,  J,  K,  L,  N,  O,  01,  P,  Q,  R,  S,  T,  U, 
V,  W,  X,  Y,  and  Z.  USACE  jurisdictional  freshwater  wetlands  located  in  unit  CDF3  were 
identified  during  a  site  investigation  on  December  5,  2013.  The  remaining  USACE  jurisdictional 
wetland  units  were  included  in  the  NJDEP  LOI  (USACE  2014-TN3282). 


The  only  roads  and  transmission  corridors  that  traverse,  or  are  located  near,  the  PSEG  property 
are  those  that  serve  SGS  and  HCGS.  In  addition,  no  prime  farmland  soils  are  within  the 
boundaries  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Large  portions  of  the  PSEG  Site  were  disturbed  previously  for 
construction  of  SGS  and  HCGS  or  were  used  by  the  USACE  for  dredge  material  disposal. 

Salem  County  is  situated  within  the  Atlantic  Coastal  Plain,  which  is  composed  of  a  sequence  of 
unconsolidated,  highly  permeable  to  relatively  impermeable  quartz-dominated  gravel,  sand,  silt, 
glauconitic  sand  (i.e.,  greensand),  and  clay  strata.  Therefore,  the  principal  mineral  resources 
within  Salem  County  are  sand  and  gravel,  but  no  gravel  or  sand  mining  operations  occur  on  the 
PSEG  Site  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 


Cultural  resources  within  the  area  likely  to  be  affected  by  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  have  been  identified,  including  archaeological  sites  and  architectural 
resources.  Details  are  provided  in  Sections  2.7  and  4.6.

Affected  Environment 


Under  the  Federal  Coastal  Zone  Management  Act  (CZMA)  (16  USC  1451  et  seq.  -TNI 243), 
activities  of  Federal  agencies  affecting  coastal  zones  must  be  consistent  with  the  approved 
coastal  management  program  (CMP)  of  the  state  or  territory  to  the  maximum  extent  practical. 
CZMA  provisions  apply  to  all  actions  requiring  Federal  approval  (e.g.,  new  plant  licenses  and 
license  renewals)  that  affect  the  coastal  zone  in  a  state  or  territory  with  a  Federally  approved 
CMP.  The  PSEG  Site  is  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  CZMA,  so  PSEG  filed  an  application  for 
a  CZMA  consistency  determination  from  the  State  of  New  Jersey.  On  July  13,  2010,  NJDEP’s 
Division  of  Land  Use  Regulation  issued  its  determination  that  PSEG’s  ESP  application  is 
consistent  with  New  Jersey’s  Rules  on  Coastal  Zone  Management  as  amended  to  January  20, 
2009  (NJAC  7:7E-TN2272)  with  one  condition: 

“As  proposed,  the  project  will  require  a  [Coastal  Area  Facility  Review  Act  (NJSA 
13:19  et  seq.  -TN4304)  CAFRA  Individual  Permit,  Coastal  Wetlands  Permit, 

Waterfront  Development  Permit,  and  Freshwater  Wetlands  Individual  Permit  from 
the  Division.  These  permits  must  be  obtained  prior  to  any  construction  activities 
on  the  site  related  to  the  project  described  above”  (NJDEP  2010-TN235). 

The  New  Jersey  State  Planning  Commission’s  State  Plan  Policy  Map  delineates  a  “Heavy 
Industry-Transportation-Utility  Node”  on  Artificial  Island,  including  501  ac  of  the  existing  734-ac 
HCGS/SGS  site  (PSEG  2012-TN2282).  In  2002,  NJDEP  amended  the  CAFRA  Planning  Map  to 
include  the  Energy  Facility  Node,  recognizing  among  other  things  that  this  designation  would 
enable  PSEG  to  maintain  and  upgrade  its  existing  nuclear  facilities.  The  “Node”  designation 
allows  for  increased  impervious  cover  and  intensity  of  use  (PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

On  May  30,  2012,  PSEG  submitted  a  petition  to  the  Department  of  State,  Office  for  Planning 
Advocacy  (OPA),  for  expansion  of  PSEG’s  existing  Heavy  Industry-Transportation-Utility  Node 
(PSEG  201 2-TN2282).  The  expansion  of  the  Node  boundary  to  the  north  would  include  the 
location  of  the  proposed  nuclear  power  plant  and  288  ac  of  the  Artificial  Island  CDF.  In  addition 
to  288  ac  of  land  within  the  CDF,  PSEG  also  petitioned  for  an  amendment  to  the  existing  Node 
for  land  currently  on  PSEG  property.  This  amendment  would  increase  the  existing  Node  on  the 
PSEG  Site  from  501  to  534  ac  (PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

PSEG’s  petition  for  Node  change  is  currently  under  review  at  OPA.  PSEG  anticipates  OPA  will 
deem  the  application  complete  soon  and  that  the  remaining  process  of  acquiring  OPA  approval 
and  subsequent  amendment  to  New  Jersey’s  Coastal  Zone  Management  Rules  (NJAC  7:7E- 
TN2272)  would  take  8  to  16  months  (PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

Salem  County,  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle  County,  Delaware  are  the  only  counties  located 
within  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  (Figure  2-7).  Most  of  the  land  north  and  east  of  the 
PSEG  Site  is  owned  by  the  Federal  government  (under  control  of  the  USACE)  and  the  State  of 
New  Jersey.  Of  the  USACE  land  north  of  the  PSEG  Site,  305  ac  has  been  developed  for  use 
as  the  Artificial  Island  CDF  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

Affected  Environment 


The  PSEG  Site  and  all  surrounding  land  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  is  located  in  the  Coastal  Lowlands 
subregion  of  the  Atlantic  Coastal  Plain,  is  at  a  low  elevation,  and  has  little  topographical  relief. 
The  Coastal  Lowlands  is  characterized  by  poor  drainage,  shallow  water  tables,  abundant 
wetlands,  and  tidal  streams  and  rivers.  Land  uses  within  the  Coastal  Lowlands  include 
wetlands  (46  percent),  agriculture  (27  percent),  forest  (20  percent),  urban  (6  percent),  and 
barren  land  (1  percent)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

According  to  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  LULC  data  cited  in  the  PSEG  Environmental 
Report  (ER)  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280),  three  major  land  uses  (open  water,  wetlands,  and 
agriculture)  account  for  94  percent  of  the  total  73,71 1  ac  within  the  6-mi  vicinity.  Table  2-2 
presents  the  acreage  for  each  of  13  land  uses  within  the  vicinity.  Open  water  (primarily  the 
Delaware  River)  represents  36.4  percent  of  the  total  vicinity  area,  while  wetlands  (emergent 
herbaceous  and  woody  wetlands)  and  agriculture  represent  34.7  and  23.2  percent, 
respectively.  Developed  land,  forests,  and  barren  land  account  for  the  remaining  land  use 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Figure  2-7  defines  the  areas  within  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  that  are 
included  within  the  vicinity  and  depicts  the  distribution  of  the  land  cover  and  land  use  within  this 
area.

Affected  Environment 


Figure  2-8  identifies  prime  farmland  and  farmland  of  unique  or  statewide  importance  within  the 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  areas  that  could  be  affected  by  causeway  development  are 
identified  using  soil  information  (types  and  slopes)  specified  as  prime  by  the  U.S.  Department  of 
Agriculture  (USDA)  Natural  Resource  Conservation  Service  (NRCS)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Prime  farmland  of  statewide  importance  is  located  in  uplands  east  of  the  PSEG  Site.  In  contrast, 
farmlands  of  "unique”  importance  correspond  to  lands  within  the  coastal  wetlands  and  may  relate 
to  the  historical  use  of  some  of  these  areas  for  salt  hay  farming.  As  illustrated  in  Figure  2-8, 
upland  areas  east  of  the  PSEG  Site  have  also  been  designated  by  Salem  County  as  “Farm 
Project  Area  3.”  However,  no  specific  tracts  having  restrictions  as  preserved  farmlands  have 
been  identified  within  6  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

There  are  no  accessible  highways,  major  airports,  or  railroads  within  6  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site.  In 
relation  to  the  PSEG  Site,  Delaware  Route  9  is  located  3  mi  to  the  west  and  Delaware  Routes  1 
and  13  are  located  over  5  mi  to  the  west.  New  Jersey  Route  49  is  located  7.5  mi  to  the 
northeast,  and  Interstate  295  and  the  Delaware  Memorial  Bridge  are  15  mi  to  the  north 
(Figure  2-9).  Philadelphia  International  Airport,  the  closest  major  airport,  is  located  30  mi  to  the 
northeast.  New  Castle  County  Airport  in  Delaware  is  a  small  regional  airport  located  south  of 
Wilmington  that  offers  a  small  number  of  commercial  operations.  The  closest  railroad  is  a 
Southern  Railroad  Company  of  New  Jersey  rail  line  located  8  mi  to  the  northeast  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

2.2.2  Offsite  Areas 

This  section  describes  land  use  along  the  existing  transmission  line  corridors  from  the  PSEG 
Site  (Section  2. 2. 2.1),  the  existing  access  road  corridor  for  the  PSEG  Site  (Section  2. 2. 2. 2),  and 
the  proposed  access  road  (i.e.,  causeway)  corridor  for  the  PSEG  Site  (Section  2. 2. 2. 3). 

2.2.2. 7  Existing  Transmission  Lines 

There  are  two  500-kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  lines  to  the  HCGS  switchyard  from  offsite  and  one 
500-kV  tie  line  from  HCGS  to  the  SGS  switchyard.  One  of  the  existing  offsite  lines  is  a  tie  to  the 
Red  Lion  Substation,  located  northwest  in  New  Castle  County,  Delaware,  and  the  other  is  a  tie 
to  the  New  Freedom  Substation,  located  northeast  in  Camden  County,  New  Jersey  (PSEG 
2015-TN4280). 

There  are  also  two  existing  500-kV  transmission  lines  to  the  SGS  switchyard  from  offsite  and 
one  500-kV  tie  line  from  SGS  to  the  HCGS  switchyard.  Both  offsite  lines  are  ties  to  the  New 
Freedom  Substation  in  Camden  County,  New  Jersey  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

The  transmission  corridor  ROWs  on  these  existing  lines  range  from  200  to  350  ft  wide.  The 
three  corridors  cross  Camden,  Gloucester,  and  Salem  counties  in  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle 
County  in  Delaware;  they  are  about  102  mi  in  total  length  (one  of  the  corridors  is  shared  by  two 
transmission  lines).  The  transmission  line  to  New  Castle  County  crosses  the  Delaware  River 
north  of  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).

Affected  Environment 


The  three  transmission  line  corridors  are  shown  on  Figure  2-10  and  contain  the  following  lines 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

•  Hope  Creek-New  Freedom:  extends  northeast  from  HCGS  for  43  mi  in  a  350-ft-wide 
corridor  to  the  New  Freedom  Substation  north  of  Williamstown,  New  Jersey.  This  line 
generally  shares  the  corridor  with  the  Salem-New  Freedom  line.  In  2008,  a  new  substation 
(Orchard)  was  installed  along  this  line,  dividing  it  into  two  segments. 

•  Salem-New  Freedom:  extends  northeast  from  SGS  for  50  mi  in  a  350-ft-wide  corridor  to  the 
New  Freedom  Substation.  This  line  generally  shares  the  corridor  with  the  HCGS-New 
Freedom  line. 

•  Hope  Creek-Red  Lion:  extends  north  from  HCGS  for  13  mi,  then  continues  west  over  the 
Delaware  River  approximately  4  mi  to  the  Red  Lion  Substation  in  Delaware.  One-third  of 
the  17-mi  corridor  is  350  ft  wide  and  the  remainder  is  200  ft  wide. 

•  Salem-New  Freedom  South:  extends  northeast  from  SGS  for  42  mi  in  a  variable  width 
corridor  (generally  350  ft  wide)  to  the  New  Freedom  Substation. 

PSEG  has  developed  a  description  of  existing  land  uses  along  these  transmission  lines  based 
on  an  analysis  of  USGS  LULC  data  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  PSEG  used  a  500-ft-wide  corridor 
centered  on  the  existing  ROWs  to  characterize  baseline  land  uses  along  the  existing  corridors. 
Three  major  land  uses  were  identified  (i.e. ,  agriculture,  forests,  and  wetlands)  that  collectively 
account  for  most  of  the  6,920  ac  within  the  three  corridor  ROWs.  Table  2-3  presents  the 
acreage  for  each  of  13  land  uses  along  the  existing  transmission  line  corridors.  Agriculture 
(pasture  hay  and  cultivated  crops)  represents  39  percent  of  the  total  ROW  area,  while  forests 
(deciduous,  evergreen,  and  mixed),  and  wetlands  (woody  and  emergent  herbaceous)  represent 
30  and  23  percent,  respectively.  Developed  land  (2  percent),  open  water  (3  percent),  and 
barren  land  (2  percent)  account  for  the  remaining  land  use  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

2. 2. 2. 2  Existing  A  ccess  Road 

The  existing  access  road  to  the  PSEG  property  extends  from  the  property  through  coastal 
wetlands  in  an  easterly  and  east-northeasterly  direction  for  3.6  mi,  where  it  connects  to  Alloway 
Creek  Neck  Road,  an  existing  secondary  road  (Figure  2-7).  Alloway  Creek  Neck  Road 
continues  through  uplands  to  the  town  of  Hancock’s  Bridge  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

2. 2. 2. 3  Proposed  Access  Road 

PSEG  has  stated  that  additional  access  road  capacity  is  necessary  to  address  future 
transportation  needs  for  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  To  provide  this  additional 
access  road  capacity,  PSEG  has  designed  a  three-lane  causeway  that  would  be  constructed  on 
elevated  structures  for  its  entire  length  through  the  coastal  wetlands.  The  proposed  causeway 
would  extend  about  5.0  mi  northeast  from  the  PSEG  Site  along  or  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope 
Creek-Red  Lion  transmission  corridor  ROW  to  the  intersection  of  Money  Island  Road  and 
Mason  Point  Road  (Figure  2-7).  PSEG’s  conceptual  design  for  the  causeway  specifies  a 
200-ft-wide  ROW  in  upland  areas  at  the  northern  and  southern  termini  and  a  48-ft-wide 
structure  for  the  elevated  portions  of  the  causeway  within  lowland  areas  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).

Existing  land  uses  along  the  proposed  causeway  alignment  are  shown  in  Figure  2-4  and 
summarized  as  part  of  the  vicinity  in  Table  2-2.  NJDEP  LULC  data  for  the  69-ac  area  that 
would  be  affected  by  causeway  construction  indicate  that  Phragmites- dominated  coastal  and 
interior  wetlands  combined  represent  41 .4  percent,  freshwater  tidal  marshes  make  up 
18.4  percent,  and  cropland  and  pastureland  represent  15.8  percent.  Other  minor  LULCs  along 
the  causeway  route  include  water,  developed  lands,  and  forest/old  fields  (PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

The  proposed  causeway  would  permanently  affect  an  additional  25.2  ac  of  offsite  wetlands,  the 
impacts  of  which  would  be  minimized  by  using  an  elevated  design.  The  wetland  types  that 
would  be  impacted  by  the  causeway  include  11.2  ac  of  Phragmites- dominated  coastal  wetlands, 
6.1  ac  of  freshwater  tidal  marshes,  4.4  ac  of  Phragmites- dominated  interior  wetlands,  1 .2  ac  of 
herbaceous  wetlands,  1.1  ac  of  wetlands  ROW,  0.9  ac  of  agricultural  wetlands  (modified), 

0.2  ac  of  former  agricultural  wetlands,  and  0.1  ac  of  mixed  scrub/shrub  wetlands.  The 
causeway  would  also  permanently  affect  2.4  ac  of  tidal  rivers,  inland  bays,  and  other  tidal 
waters  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

The  proposed  causeway  would  cross  NJDEP’s  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA,  NJDEP’s  Abbotts 
Meadow  WMA,  and  lands  that  are  part  of  PSEG’s  Alloway  Creek  Watershed  Wetland 
Restoration  (ACW)  Site,  which  is  part  of  PSEG’s  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  (EEP),  as 
shown  in  Figure  2-1 1  (PSEG  2012-TN2282).  These  three  properties  have  different  ownership 
and  deed  impediments,  including  some  parcels  that  are  under  a  Deed  of  Conservation 
Restriction  (DCR),  as  discussed  in  Section  4.1.

2.2.3  The  Region 

The  region  surrounding  the  PSEG  Site  is  defined  as  the  area  within  a  50-mi  radius  of  the  new 
plant  centerpoint.  A  50-mi  radius  is  used  to  define  the  region  because  almost  all  of  the  impacts 
of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  confined  to  that  area.  The  region 
includes  all  or  parts  of  25  counties  in  four  states  (i.e.,  three  in  Delaware,  seven  in  Maryland, 
seven  in  New  Jersey,  and  eight  in  Pennsylvania),  as  shown  in  Figure  2-12.  The  region  is  within 
the  Coastal  Lowlands,  Middle  Coastal  Plain,  and  Inner  Coastal  Plain  subregions  of  the  Mid- 
Atlantic  Coastal  Plain.  Section  2.2.1  describes  characteristics  of  the  Coastal  Lowlands.  The 
Middle  Coastal  Plain  is  the  other  major  subregion  near  the  PSEG  Site,  and  it  is  characterized  by 
variable  drainage,  abundant  forests,  low  topographic  elevations,  and  low  to  moderate  relief. 

Land  uses  in  the  Middle  Coastal  Plain  include  forest  (38  to  60  percent),  agriculture 
(27  to  39  percent),  wetlands  (9  to  21  percent),  urban  (3  to  7  percent),  and  barren  land 
(1  to  2  percent).  Similarly,  land  uses  in  the  Inner  Coast  Plain  include  forest  (46  to  59  percent), 
agriculture  (23  to  28  percent),  urban  (10  to  16  percent),  wetlands  (6  to  7  percent),  and  barren 
land  (2  to  3  percent)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Figure  2-12  delineates  the  areas  within  Delaware,  Maryland,  New  Jersey,  and  Pennsylvania 
that  are  included  within  the  region  and  depicts  the  distribution  of  LULC.  USGS  LULC  data 
indicate  that  four  major  land  uses  (agriculture,  forests,  open  water,  and  developed  lands) 
account  for  89  percent  of  the  total  area  (5,024,234  ac)  within  the  region.  Table  2-2  presents  the 
acreage  for  each  of  13  land  uses  within  the  region.  Agricultural  uses  represent  37  percent  of 
the  total  region  area,  while  forests  (deciduous,  evergreen,  and  mixed)  account  for  24  percent. 
Open  water  (principally  the  Delaware  Bay,  Delaware  River,  and  Chesapeake  Bay)  accounts  for 
16  percent  of  the  regional  area,  and  developed  lands  (open  space  and  low-to-high  intensity) 
represent  13  percent.  Wetlands  (10  percent)  and  barren  land  account  for  the  remaining  land 
use  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

As  shown  in  Figure  2-9,  major  highways  in  the  region  include  Interstates  76,  95,  276,  295,  476, 
495,  and  676.  Other  principal  roadways  include  New  Jersey  Route  55,  the  New  Jersey 
Turnpike,  the  Garden  State  Parkway,  and  the  Atlantic  City  Expressway.  The  Delaware  Bay, 
Delaware  River,  Chesapeake  and  Delaware  Canal,  and  Chesapeake  Bay  represent  the  major 
waterways  within  the  region.  Major  rail  lines  or  rail  systems  include  those  owned  by  Conrail, 
Southeastern  Pennsylvania  Transportation  Authority,  Port  Authority  Transit  Corporation,  and 
Southern  Railroad  of  New  Jersey  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).

2.3  Water 

This  section  describes  the  hydrological  processes  governing  movement  and  distribution  of  water 
in  the  existing  environment  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Water  use  and  monitoring  at  the  PSEG  Site  are 
also  described.  Surface  water  is  used  as  a  cooling  fluid  for  the  SGS  and  HCGS  units  at  the 
PSEG  Site,  and  would  be  used  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Groundwater 
is  used  for  SGS  and  HCGS  operations,  and  additional  groundwater  withdrawals  would  be 
needed  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  following  description  is  limited  to  only  those  parts 
of  the  hydrosphere  that  may  affect,  or  be  affected  by,  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

2.3.1  Hydrology 

This  section  describes  the  site-specific  and  regional  hydrological  features  of  the  existing 
environment  that  could  be  altered  by  building  or  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  A  description  of  the  site’s  hydrological  features  is  presented  in  Section  2.3.1  of  the 
PSEG  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  hydrological  features  of  the  site  related  to  site  safety 
(e.g.,  probable  maximum  flood)  are  described  in  the  PSEG  Site  Safety  Analysis  Report  (SSAR) 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4283). 

A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  withdraw  most  of  the  water  needed  during 
building  and  operations  from  the  Delaware  River  using  a  new  intake  structure  and  would 
discharge  the  blowdown  from  the  circulating  water  system  (CWS)  cooling  towers  to  the  river 
using  a  discharge  pipe.  A  new  causeway  would  also  be  built  from  the  PSEG  Site  toward  the 
northeast  and  would  cross  existing  water  bodies.  Development  of  a  new  plant  would  result  in 
building  in  floodplains  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  the  environment  described  in  this  section 
includes  the  following: 

•  the  Delaware  River  because  it  would  be  the  source  of  water  withdrawn  for  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  would  be  the  receiving  water  body  of  effluent 
discharge; 

•  the  coastal  streams  near  the  PSEG  Site  because  they  may  be  affected  by  building  a  new 
power  plant; 

•  the  local  surface-water  features  on  and  adjacent  to  the  site  that  may  receive  stormwater 
runoff; 

•  the  100-year  floodplains  near  the  PSEG  Site  because  some  building  would  occur  inside  the 
existing  100-year  floodplain; 

•  the  coastal  area  along  the  proposed  causeway  route  because  some  building  activity  would 
occur  within  this  area; 

•  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  because  conditions  in  the  estuary  affect  the  Delaware  River 
near  the  PSEG  Site; 

•  the  Chesapeake  and  Delaware  (C&D)  Canal  that  connects  the  Chesapeake  Bay  with  the 
Delaware  River  because  the  bidirectional  flow  in  the  canal  can  affect  water  levels  near  the 
PSEG  Site;  and 


NUREG-2168 


2-24 


November  2015 


Affected  Environment 


•  the  local  and  regional  groundwater  systems  because  they  are  the  source  of  freshwater 
needed  during  building  and  operation  of  a  new  plant. 

2.3. 7.7  Surface-  Water  Hydrology 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  on  the  eastern  bank  of  the  Delaware  River  at  Delaware  RM  52 
(Figure  2-13).  The  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  are  located  on  Artificial  Island  between  Delaware 
RM  51  and  52.  Artificial  Island  was  created  by  the  USACE’s  deposition  of  Delaware  River 
dredged  material  behind  a  natural  sandbar  and  bulkhead.  The  Delaware  River  is  about  2.5  mi 
wide  near  the  PSEG  Site. 

Numerous  streams  near  the  PSEG  Site  flow  into  the  Delaware  River  from  both  the  New  Jersey 
and  the  Delaware  sides  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  St.  Georges  Creek,  Augustine  Creek,  Silver  Run, 
Appoquinimink  River,  and  Blackbird  Creek  flow  into  the  Delaware  River  from  the  Delaware  side  at 
approximately  Delaware  RM  56.5,  53.5,  52.5,  51,  and  50.5,  respectively.  Mill  Creek,  Alloway 
Creek,  Hope  Creek,  Fishing  Creek,  and  Mad  Horse  Creek  flow  into  the  Delaware  River  from  the 
New  Jersey  side  at  about  Delaware  RM  56.5,  54,  48.5,  47.5,  and  45,  respectively. 

Figure  2-14  shows  the  water  bodies  (i.e.,  lakes,  streams,  marsh  creeks,  and  drainage  channels) 
on  and  immediately  adjacent  to  the  PSEG  Site.  Tidal  wetland  channels  that  start  on  the  eastern 
side  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  Artificial  Island  CDF  flow  toward  the  east  and  northeast  into 
Fishing  Creek.  Starting  east  of  the  north  end  of  the  Artificial  Island,  Fishing  Creek  flows  north 
into  the  Delaware  River  at  a  point  south  of  where  Alloway  Creek  flows  into  the  river.  The  small 
artificial  lakes  located  on  Artificial  Island  are  shallow,  perched  water  bodies,  isolated  from 
underlying  groundwater  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  These  artificial  lakes  are  used  for  the  disposal  of 
dredged  material  and  are  referred  to  as  desilt  basins  in  this  EIS  (see  Table  2-1). 

The  Delaware  River  near  the  PSEG  Site  is  tidally  influenced;  therefore,  the  water  surface 
elevations  generated  by  large  storm-surge  events  are  generally  higher  than  those  produced  by 
riverine  floods  in  the  Delaware  River.  Near  the  PSEG  Site,  the  Federal  Emergency 
Management  Agency  (FEMA)  prepares  flood  risk  maps  and  has  determined  the  1  percent 
annual  exceedance  flood  water  surface  elevation  from  extreme  storm  surge  events.  The  area 
inundated  by  the  1  percent  annual  exceedance  flood  water  surface  elevation  is  commonly 
known  as  the  100-year  floodplain.  The  1  percent  annual  exceedance  flood  water  surface 
elevation  at  the  confluence  of  the  Delaware  River  and  Alloway  Creek  is  8.9  ft  National  Geodetic 
Vertical  Datum  of  1929  (NGVD29)  (FEMA  1982-TN3214).  Near  the  PSEG  Site,  the  NAVD88  is 
about  0.84  ft  above  the  NGVD29.  Therefore,  the  1  percent  annual  exceedance  flood  water 
surface  elevation  at  the  confluence  of  the  Delaware  River  and  Alloway  Creek  is  8.1  ft  NAVD88. 

Because  the  100-year  floodplain  near  the  PSEG  Site  is  controlled  by  storm  surges,  the 
contiguous  floodplain  is  vast,  consisting  of  the  low-lying  coastal  areas.  The  applicant  estimated 
that  the  area  of  the  1 00-year  floodplain  within  a  6-mi  radius  of  the  PSEG  Site  is  59,681  ac 
(93.5  mi2)  (PSEG  2012-TN2244).

The  Delaware  River  Basin 

Most  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  is  located  within  the  States  of  New  York,  New  Jersey, 
Pennsylvania,  and  Delaware.  A  small  portion  of  the  northeastern  corner  of  Maryland  is  also 
within  the  basin.  The  Delaware  River  Basin  is  approximately  13,600  mi2  in  area,  including  the 
approximately  800-mi2  area  of  the  Delaware  Bay,  and  receives  approximately  45  in.  of  annual 
precipitation  (DRBC  2008-TN2277). 

The  East  Branch  Delaware  River  originates  near  Roxbury,  New  York,  and  flows  generally  west  (see 
Figure  2-1 3).  The  West  Branch  Delaware  River  originates  near  Stamford,  New  York,  and  also 
flows  generally  west.  The  East  and  the  West  Branches  meet  to  form  the  Delaware  River  below 
Hancock,  New  York.  From  this  point,  the  Delaware  River  flows  generally  to  the  south,  forming  the 
borders  between  the  States  of  New  York  and  Pennsylvania,  New  Jersey  and  Pennsylvania,  and 
New  Jersey  and  Delaware.  The  Delaware  River  expands  into  the  Delaware  Bay  and  discharges 
into  the  Atlantic  Ocean  near  Cape  Henlopen,  Delaware,  and  Cape  May,  New  Jersey.  The 
Delaware  River  Basin  Commission  (DRBC)  uses  a  river  mileage  system  for  location  and 
identification  along  the  Delaware  River  and  Bay  (DRBC  201 1-TN2412).  Mile  zero  in  the  river 
mileage  system  (Delaware  RM  0)  is  located  at  the  mouth  of  the  Delaware  Bay  on  the  intersection  of 
the  navigation  channel  with  a  line  between  Capes  Henlopen  and  May.  The  head  of  the  Delaware 
River  is  at  Delaware  RM  330.7  at  the  confluence  of  East  and  West  Branches  near  Hancock,  New 
York.

Parameters  measured  daily  in  the  Delaware  River  by  USGS  at  the  stream  gages  near  the 
PSEG  Site  are  shown  in  Table  2-4.  Discharge  is  measured  only  at  the  Trenton  and  Lambertville 
gages.  The  Trenton  gage  has  a  relatively  long  period  of  discharge  measurements  (since  1912 
and  continuing),  but  the  Lambertville  gage  has  only  a  9-year  record.  Gage  heights  are 
measured  at  several  other  locations. 

The  annual  discharge  of  the  Delaware  River  for  the  period  of  record  at  Trenton  is  shown  in 
Table  2-5.  The  annual  discharge  at  Trenton  varies  from  4,708  to  22,040  cfs  with  a  long-term 
mean  of  1 2,004  cfs.  The  maximum  annual  discharge  occurred  in  water  year  2011.  The  next 
four  largest  annual  discharges — 19,810,  18,190,  18,020,  and  17,540  cfs — occurred  in  water 
years  1928,  2004,  1952,  and  1973,  respectively.  The  maximum  instantaneous  peak  discharge 
measured  at  Trenton  was  329,000  cfs  on  August  20,  1955  (USGS  2013-TN2405).

Figure  2-15  shows  the  annual  discharge  in  the  Delaware  River  at  Trenton.  The  Delaware  River 
Basin  experienced  the  most  severe  drought  during  1961  to  1967  with  a  mean  annual  flow  of 
7,888  cfs  at  Trenton,  approximately  66  percent  of  long-term  mean  annual  discharge.  At 
Trenton,  the  annual  discharge  in  the  Delaware  River  fell  below  the  long-term  mean  annual 
discharge  in  1961  and  stayed  below  75  percent  of  the  long-term  mean  until  1968.  In  1972,  the 
annual  discharge  exceeded  the  long  term  mean  for  the  first  time  since  1960.  During  this 
extended  drought  period,  the  annual  discharge  at  Trenton  also  reached  its  historical  minimum  in 
1965,  when  it  fell  below  50  percent  of  the  long-term  mean  annual  discharge.  Other  multiyear 
periods  when  the  annual  discharge  at  Trenton  was  below  the  long-term  mean  annual  discharge 
include  1914  to  1915,  1917  to  1919,  1921  to  1926,  1929  to  1932,  1940  to  1942,  1949  to  1950, 
1980  to  1982,  1987  to  1989,  and  1991  to  1992.  The  annual  discharge  fell  below  75  percent  of 
the  long-term  mean  during  1921  to  1926,  1929  to  1932,  and  1980  to  1982.

Figure  2-15.  Annual  Discharge  at  the  Trenton  USGS  Streamflow  Gage 

An  analysis  of  the  monthly  Delaware  River  discharge  at  the  Trenton  USGS  streamflow  gage  for 
1 91 3  to  201 1  water  years  shows  that  low  flows  occur  in  late  summer  through  fall  with  a  late  fall 
peak  in  December  (Figure  2-16).  Discharge  reduces  with  the  onset  of  winter  before  reaching 
the  annual  peak  in  March  or  April.  In  late  spring  through  summer,  discharge  in  the  Delaware 
River  gradually  reduces,  reaching  annual  lows  from  July  through  October.  The  maximum 
monthly  discharge  of  60,840  cfs  occurred  in  March  1936,  and  the  minimum  monthly  discharge 
of  1,548  cfs  occurred  in  July  1965. 

The  mainstem  Delaware  River  does  not  have  any  reservoirs  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  However, 
there  are  24  reservoirs  on  its  tributaries  of  which  nine  are  water  supply  reservoirs,  two  are 
hydropower  reservoirs,  three  are  flood  control  reservoirs,  one  is  solely  used  for  flow 
augmentation,  and  the  remaining  nine  are  dual  or  multipurpose  reservoirs  used  for  water 
supply,  flow  augmentation,  and/or  flood  control  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  According  to  the 
USACE  National  Inventory  of  Dams  (USACE  2013-TN2407),  there  are  more  than  1 ,000  dams  in 
the  Delaware  River  Basin;  19  of  these  have  normal  storages  exceeding  10,000  ac-ft  as  listed  in 
Table  2-6).

The  Delaware  River  Estuary 

The  Delaware  River  Estuary  extends  approximately  134  mi  from  the  mouth  of  the  Delaware  Bay 
upstream  to  Trenton,  New  Jersey,  the  farthest  point  of  tidal  influence  (Cook  et  al.  2007- 
TN2983).  The  maximum  width  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  is  about  28  mi,  and  its  mean 
depth  is  about  26  ft  (Garvine  et  al.  1992-TN2989).  The  Delaware  River  Estuary  is  weakly 
stratified  with  a  typical  salinity  variation  of  only  1  practical  salinity  unit(1)  because  the  tidal  flux  is 
large,  exceeding  220  times  the  freshwater  discharge  from  Delaware  River  (Garvine  et  al.  1992- 
TN2989). 

The  first  mention  of  dredging  using  man-powered  treadmills  and  disposal  in  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  dates  back  to  1784  and  1803,  respectively,  and  the  first  mechanical,  steam-powered 
dredging  is  described  as  occurring  in  1804  (Snyder  and  Guss  1974-TN2280).  In  the  early  19th 
century,  depths  of  12  to  27  ft  were  adequate  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  In  1853,  to  improve 
navigation,  it  was  proposed  to  employ  a  combination  of  dredging  and  diking  the  stream  banks 
with  spoils  dumped  behind  stone-filled  timber  dikes  (Snyder  and  Guss  1974-TN2280).  After  the

defined  in  1978  as  the  dimensionless  ratio  of  the  electrical  conductivity  of  a  sample  of  water  to  that  of 
a  standard  potassium  chloride  solution.  Another  way  to  express  salinity  is  the  ratio  of  weight  of 
dissolved  salts  to  the  weight  of  the  water  as  parts-per-thousand  or  ppt.  There  is  a  small  numeric 
difference  between  salinities  of  the  same  water  expressed  using  the  two  methods.

Civil  War  and  reorganization  of  the  USACE  in  1866,  the  great  expansion  of  maritime  traffic  for 
the  Philadelphia  port  and  the  advent  of  international  shipping  lanes  into  the  Delaware  River  and 
Bay  prompted  the  need  for  a  permanent  shipping  channel  and  its  continued  maintenance 
(Snyder  and  Guss  1974-TN2280).  During  this  time,  a  depth  of  27  ft  at  low  water  was 
considered  adequate  for  the  shipping  channel.  Numerous  bars,  shoals,  and  flats  interrupted  the 
navigable  reaches.  In  1879,  the  first  rock  removal  occurred  at  Schooner  Ledge.  The  Rivers 
and  Harbors  Act  of  1899  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  -TN660)  authorized  a  survey  for  creation  of  a  30- 
ft-deep  channel  from  Philadelphia  to  Delaware  Bay.  Baker  and  Stony  Point  shoals  were 
enclosed  by  bulkheads  to  create  Artificial  Island,  the  principal  disposal  site  for  the  Lower 
Delaware,  when  excavation  began  for  a  30-ft-deep  channel  in  1900  (Snyder  and  Guss  1974- 
TN2280).  The  shipping  channel  from  the  Delaware  Bay  to  the  Philadelphia  Navy  Yard  was 
deepened  to  40  ft  by  dredging  conducted  from  December  1940  to  February  1942  (Snyder  and 
Guss  1974-TN2280). 

The  USACE  is  currently  deepening  the  existing  shipping  channel  to  a  depth  of  45  ft  mean  lower 
low  water  (USACE  201 1-TN2262).  Proposed  channel  side  slope  is  3  horizontal  to  1  vertical. 

The  channel  width  will  be  the  same  as  the  existing  channel  width,  which  is  400  ft  in  Philadelphia 
harbor,  800  ft  from  Philadelphia  Navy  Yard  to  Bombay  Hook,  and  1 ,000  ft  from  Bombay  Hook  to 
the  mouth  of  Delaware  Bay  (USACE  201 1-TN2262).  Approximately  16  million  yd3  of  material 
will  be  dredged  and  placed  in  USACE  CDFs  and  for  beneficial  uses  within  the  Delaware  Bay 
(USACE  201 1-TN2262). 

The  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  the  upper  Chesapeake  Bay  are  connected  via  the  C&D  canal, 
which  is  approximately  14  mi  long,  450  ft  wide,  and  35  ft  deep  (USACE  1997-TN2281 ).  Joining 
the  waters  of  the  Chesapeake  Bay  and  the  Delaware  River  Estuary — an  idea  envisioned  as  far 
back  as  the  17th  century — greatly  shortens  the  300-mi  trip  around  the  coast  of  Delaware  and 
Maryland  (USACE  2012-TN2408).  The  Chesapeake  and  Delaware  Canal  Company  built  the 
original  canal,  which  was  only  66  ft  wide  and  10  ft  deep,  from  1824  to  1829  (USACE  2012- 
TN2408).  The  Federal  Government  purchased  the  canal  in  1919.  The  canal  was  expanded  to  a 
width  of  90  ft  and  a  depth  of  12  ft  and  was  converted  to  operate  at  sea-level.  Another  expansion 
during  1933  to  1938  resulted  in  a  250-ft-wide  and  27-ft-deep  canal.  A  final  expansion  of  the  canal 
during  the  1960s  and  1970s  resulted  in  its  present-day  size  (USACE  2012-TN2408).  Because  of 
fluctuations  in  tides  and  circulations,  the  flow  in  the  C&D  canal  can  be  in  either  direction.  The 
Delaware  River  Estuary  end  of  the  C&D  canal  is  at  Delaware  RM  59.  The  C&D  canal  carries 
40  percent  of  the  shipping  traffic  into  and  out  of  the  Port  of  Baltimore  (USACE  2012-TN2408). 

Tides  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  are  semidiurnal.  The  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric 
Administration  (NOAA)  maintains  several  tide  gages  in  the  Delaware  River  and  Bay  area.  At 
the  mouth  of  the  Delaware  Bay,  NOAA  has  two  tide  gages  at  Lewes,  Delaware,  and  at  Cape 
May,  New  Jersey.  The  mean  tidal  ranges  at  these  stations  are  4.1  and  4.9  ft,  respectively 
(NOAA  2014-TN241 1 ).  The  mean  tidal  range  at  the  Trenton  Marine  Terminal,  New  Jersey, 
NOAA  tide  gage  is  8.2  ft  (NOAA  2014-TN241 1 ).  The  funnel  shape  of  the  estuary  and  the 
presence  of  the  shipping  channel  result  in  amplification  of  the  tidal  range  at  Trenton,  New 
Jersey  (DiLorenzo  et  al.  1993-TN2979).

2. 3. 1.2  Groundwater  Hydrology 

The  geology  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  surrounding  region  is  described  in  detail  in  SSAR 
Section  2.5  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  The  PSEG  Site  is  located  in  the  Coastal  Plain 
physiographic  province,  a  region  between  the  Atlantic  Ocean  and  the  Fall  Line  characterized  by 
generally  low  topographic  relief  and  underlain  by  semi-consolidated  to  unconsolidated 
sediments  consisting  of  clays,  silts,  sands,  and  some  gravel  (Trapp  and  Horn  1997-TN1865). 
The  Fall  Line  is  a  low  east-facing  cliff,  generally  parallel  to  the  Atlantic  coastline,  extending  from 
New  Jersey  to  the  Carolinas.  It  separates  the  Mesozoic  and  Tertiary  Coastal  Plain  sediments 
from  the  harder  Paleozoic  metamorphic  rocks  of  the  Piedmont  physiographic  province  to  the 
west.  The  PSEG  Site  is  approximately  18  mi  south  of  the  Fall  Line. 

Regional  Groundwater  Description 

Regional  groundwater  hydrology  is  described  in  ER  Section  2. 3. 1.2  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  and 
SSAR  Section  2.4.12  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283).  The  hydrogeologic  description  provided  in  these 
documents  is  consistent  with  the  regional  description  provided  in  Segment  1 1  of  the  Ground 
Water  Atlas  of  the  United  States  (Trapp  and  Horn  1997-TN1865).  The  PSEG  Site  is  located 
within  the  New  Jersey  Coastal  Plain  aquifer  system,  part  of  the  Northern  Atlantic  Coastal  Plain 
aquifer  system.  The  New  Jersey  Coastal  Plain  aquifer  system  consists  of  a  wedge-shaped 
mass  of  unconsolidated  sediments  of  clay,  silt,  sand,  and  gravel.  The  wedge  is  6,000  ft  thick  in 
Cape  May  County  and  thins  northwestward  to  the  Fall  Line. 

The  hydrogeologic  units  within  the  New  Jersey  Coastal  Plain  are  described  by  the  USGS  as 
southeast  dipping  permeable  fine-grained  to  coarse-grained  materials  separated  by  less 
permeable  fine-grained  materials,  resulting  in  a  multiple  aquifer  system  (Zapecza  1989-TN2994; 
Martin  1998-TN2259).  The  overlying  unconsolidated  units  reflect  the  topography  of  the 
underlying  bedrock  and  show  a  corresponding  southeasterly  dip  of  10  to  60  feet  per  mile  (ft/mi) 
(Spitz  and  dePaul  2008-TN2998).  In  general,  the  aquifers  are  thicker  near  the  ocean  and  thin 
progressively  toward  the  northwest  and  closer  to  the  western  borders  of  New  Jersey.  In  some 
instances,  aquifers  may  thin  out  entirely.  The  major  aquifers  within  the  New  Jersey  Coastal 
Plain  aquifer  system,  listed  from  deepest  to  shallowest,  are  the  Potomac-Raritan-Magothy  (PRM) 
aquifer  system,  Englishtown  aquifer,  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer,  Vincentown  aquifer, 

Piney  Point  aquifer,  Atlantic  City  800-ft  sand,  and  the  Kirkwood-Cohansey  aquifer  system 
(Martin  1998-TN2259).  Figure  2-17  illustrates  the  occurrence  of  these  aquifers  in  the  southern 
New  Jersey  Coastal  Plain  and  a  generalized  depiction  of  groundwater  flow  in  the  region. 

Regionally,  aquifer  recharge  primarily  occurs  from  precipitation  where  the  aquifer  units  outcrop. 
Additional  recharge  occurs  from  adjacent  aquifers  through  leaky  confining  units.  In  some  areas, 
aquifers  may  receive  induced  recharge  from  the  Delaware  River.  Using  a  combination  of 
regional  studies  and  model  calibration,  average  recharge  rates  for  the  New  Jersey  Coastal  Plain 
aquifer  system  were  estimated  by  the  USGS  to  range  from  6  to  20  in./yr  (Voronin  2003- 
TN2947),  with  the  lower  part  of  this  range  applicable  nearest  the  PSEG  Site.  Modeling  studies 
presented  in  the  SSAR  used  recharge  values  of  0. 1 5  to  8  in./yr  for  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4283).

Prior  to  significant  pumping,  groundwater  flow  in  the  New  Jersey  Coastal  Plain  aquifers 
generally  discharged  to  the  lower  reach  of  the  Delaware  River,  to  the  Delaware  and  Raritan 
Bays,  and  to  the  Atlantic  Ocean  (Martin  1998-TN2259).  Large-scale  groundwater  withdrawals 
in  the  1900s  reduced  the  heads  throughout  the  aquifer  system.  The  groundwater  head  in  the 
middle  PRM  aquifer  was  6  ft  NGVD29  in  1 946  at  a  well  located  about  1 0  mi  north  of  the  PSEG 
Site  (USGS  201 5-TN41 88).  Dames  and  Moore  (1 988-TN331 1 )  estimated  groundwater  heads 
to  be  -5  to  -6  ft  NGVD29  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  prior  to  the 
initiation  of  pumping  for  HCGS/SGS.  This  is  consistent  with  a  measured  head  of  -4  ft  recorded 
in  1969  by  the  USGS  for  a  well  located  on  Artificial  Island  and  screened  in  the  undifferentiated 
PRM  aquifer  (middle/lower  PRM  aquifers)  (USGS  2013-TN2999). 


Aquifer  pumping  has  had  a  significant  impact  on  groundwater  heads  and  groundwater  flow 
patterns,  impacting  the  availability  of  surface  and  groundwater  supplies  and  increasing  the 
potential  for  degradation  of  groundwater  quality  through  saltwater  intrusion  (dePaul  et  al.  2009- 
TN2948).  New  Jersey  has  designated  two  Water  Supply  Critical  Areas  in  the  New  Jersey 
Coastal  Plain  in  response  to  long-term  declines  in  groundwater  levels  where  groundwater  is  a 
primary  water  supply  (Spitz  and  dePaul  2008-TN2998).  Critical  Area  2  is  the  closest  to  the 
PSEG  Site  and  extends  into  the  easternmost  portion  of  Salem  County.  Withdrawals  from  the 
PRM  aquifer  system  are  restricted  in  Water  Supply  Critical  Area  2.  In  response  to  these 
restrictions,  some  withdrawals  in  Critical  Area  2  were  shifted  to  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel 
aquifer,  resulting  in  groundwater  head  reductions  in  that  aquifer  (Spitz  and  dePaul  2008- 
TN2998).  The  PSEG  Site  is  approximately  25  mi  southwest  of  Critical  Area  2  and  is  not  subject 
to  groundwater  withdrawal  restrictions  except  as  defined  in  applicable  permits. 

The  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  has  determined  that  the  New  Jersey  Coastal 
Plain  aquifer  system  is  a  sole  source  aquifer  (53  FR  23791 -TN2987).  This  decision  was  based

in  part  on  findings  that  75  percent  of  drinking  water  needs  in  the  area  were  derived  from 
groundwater  and  that  the  various  aquifers  respond  as  an  interrelated  aquifer  system. 

Onsite  Groundwater  Description 

To  characterize  the  local  hydrogeology,  existing  data  from  the  PSEG  Site  were  combined  with 
results  from  16  geotechnical  boreholes  and  16  observation  well  pairs  completed  for  the  ESP 
application.  Figure  2-18  shows  a  stratigraphic  section  for  the  PSEG  Site  based  on  the 
geotechnical  borings.  Geologic  formations  identified  at  the  site  correspond  to  the  layered 
aquifer-confining  unit  structure  described  in  the  regional  description  provided  above.  The  Piney 
Point  aquifer  and  Atlantic  City  800-ft  sand  are  not  present  at  the  site.  The  description  of  the  PRM 
aquifer  system  in  SSAR  Section  2.4.12  (PSEG  2015-TN4283)  differs  from  the  regional  description 
(e.g.,  in  dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948).  The  SSAR  describes  the  Raritan  Formation  as  part  of  the 
Potomac  Formation,  and  identifies  the  Upper  Raritan  aquifer  as  the  upper  PRM  aquifer  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  This  is  inconsistent  with  USGS  descriptions  and  with  the  description  in  Dames  and 
Moore  1988  (Dames  and  Moore  1988-TN331 1 ),  which  associate  the  Upper  Raritan  aquifer  with 
the  middle  PRM  aquifer.  This  EIS  follows  the  USGS  description  of  the  aquifers.  The  deepest 
geotechnical  borings  at  the  site  penetrated  the  upper  part  of  the  Potomac  Formation  (to  depths  of 
about  600  ft,  as  shown  in  Figure  2-1 8).  The  wells  supplying  the  majority  of  water  to  HCGS  and 
SGS  are  screened  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer  at  depths  of  about  800  ft  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283). 

The  surface  sediments  at  the  PSEG  Site  consist  of  artificial  fill  from  previous  construction 
activities  and  hydraulic  fill  from  channel  dredging  of  the  Delaware  River.  Plant  foundations 
would  be  constructed  on  the  sediments  of  the  Vincentown  formation  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
Elevations  of  the  top  of  the  units  and  average  thicknesses  are  given  in  Table  2-7. 

The  sediments  overlying  the  Vincentown  Formation  encountered  during  the  geotechnical 
investigation  at  the  PSEG  Site  were  identified  in  the  ER  and  SSAR  as  the  Kirkwood  Formation, 
and  were  subdivided  into  upper  and  lower  units  based  on  variations  in  lithology  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280;  PSEG  201 5-TN4283).  The  upper  unit  was  described  as  an  aquitard  and  stated  to 
consist  primarily  of  clay  and  silt  with  isolated  interbeds  of  silty  and  clayey  fine-  to 
medium-grained  sand  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  lower  unit  was  described  as  being  in 
hydraulic  communication  with  the  Vincentown  Formation  and  stated  to  consist  of  silty  and 
clayey  fine-  to  medium-grained  sand  and  fine  to  coarse  gravel  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The 
identification  of  the  sediments  overlying  the  Vincentown  Formation  on  Artificial  Island  as  the 
Kirkwood  Formation  differs  from  the  description  of  these  sediments  in  recent  USGS  and  New 
Jersey  Geological  Survey  publications.  These  publications  indicate  that  the  Kirkwood 
Formation  was  eroded  from  the  PSEG  Site  during  the  Pleistocene  and  identify  the  sediments 
overlying  the  Vincentown  Formation  at  Artificial  Island  as  belonging  to  the  Cape  May  Formation, 
subdivided  into  three  units  (Owens  &  Minard  1979-TN4189;  Stanford  201 1-TN4192).  According 
to  New  Jersey  bedrock  and  surficial  geology  maps,  the  Kirkwood  Formation  occurs  east  of 
Artificial  Island  (Owens  et  al.  1998-TN4190;  Newell  et  al.  2000-TN4191 ).  The  lithologic 
description  in  the  ER  of  the  Kirkwood  sediments  is  substantially  consistent  with  the  description 
of  the  Cape  May  Formation  sediments  found  in  Stanford  (201 1-TN4192).  This  EIS  refers  to  the 
sediments  overlying  the  Vincentown  Formation  as  the  Cape  May  Formation,  but  retains  a 
parenthetical  reference  to  the  Kirkwood  Formation  because  of  its  use  in  the  ER  and  SSAR.

(a)  The  Hornerstown  Formation  is  identifiable  by  its  high  glauconite  content  (Owens  et  al.  1999-TN4190)  and 
appears  to  be  misidentified  as  the  Navesink  Formation  in  the  PSEG  SSAR  (Appendix  2AA,  Boring  Logs 
[PSEG  2015-TN4283]).  Borehole  gamma  logs  shown  in  Stanford  (201 1-TN4192)  correlate  well  with  gamma 
logs  from  the  PSEG  Site  shown  in  SSAR  Figures  2. 5. 4. 1-1 1  to  2.5.4.1-14  and  suggest  that  the  top  of  the 
Hornerstown,  Navesink,  and  Mount  Laurel  Formations  are  about  25  ft  deeper  than  given  here  and  in  ER 
Section  2.6.2  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 


At  the  PSEG  Site,  the  upper  Cape  May  sediments  (identified  in  the  ER  as  Kirkwood  sediments) 
were  described  as  a  low-permeability  unit  separating  the  water-bearing  alluvium  from  the  more 
permeable  lower  Cape  May  sediments  and  the  Vincentown  aquifer  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Cape  May  Formation  sediments  are  depicted  as  continuous  across  Artificial  Island,  thinning  to 
the  east  where  they  overlie  the  Kirkwood  Formation  (Stanford  201 1-TN4192).  However,  the 
upper  surface  of  the  Vincentown  forms  an  erosional  unconformity,  and  the  alluvium  was  found 
to  directly  overlie  the  Vincentown  aquifer  in  one  of  the  geotechnical  boreholes  at  the  PSEG  Site 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

According  to  ER  Table  2.3-12  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  the  16  observation  well  pairs  installed  at 
the  PSEG  Site  were  completed  with  the  deeper  well  accessing  the  Vincentown  aquifer. 

Thirteen  of  the  upper  wells  were  installed  in  the  alluvium,  two  were  installed  in  the  hydraulic  fill, 
and  one  upper  well  was  installed  at  the  upper  boundary  of  the  Vincentown  aquifer  due  to  the 
absence  of  the  alluvium  at  that  location. 

PSEG  provided  time  series  plots  of  measured  groundwater  heads  and  contour  plots  of 
interpolated  groundwater  heads.  Groundwater  heads  in  the  two  wells  installed  in  the  hydraulic

fill  were  higher  than  the  surrounding  wells  installed  in  the  alluvium,  indicating  that  the 
groundwater  in  the  fill  is  likely  perched  water  and  not  in  direct  hydraulic  contact  with  the 
groundwater  in  the  alluvium.  Changes  over  time  in  the  monthly  head  values  were  generally  less 
than  2  ft  during  the  12-month  measurement  period.  There  was  no  clear  seasonal  variation  in 
heads.  High  frequency  head  measurements  in  two  wells  located  near  the  Delaware  River 
showed  that  groundwater  head  in  the  Vincentown  aquifer  was  strongly  influenced  by  the  tide. 
Tidal  influence  was  weaker  in  the  alluvium  and  appeared  to  decrease  rapidly  in  both 
hydrogeologic  units  with  increasing  distance  from  the  river. 

Average  horizontal  hydraulic  gradients  were  reported  in  ER  Table  2.3-15  and  were  generally 
less  than  0.001  ft/ft  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Vertical  gradients  based  on  average  head  values  in 
the  well  pairs  were  reported  in  ER  Table  2.3-16  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  majority  of  these 
gradients  indicated  downward  flow  from  the  alluvium  to  the  Vincentown  aquifer.  Where  it  is 
present,  the  low  permeability  of  the  intervening  upper  Cape  May  unit  (identified  in  the  ER  as  the 
upper  Kirkwood)  limits  vertical  flow  between  the  two  units. 

Groundwater  head  contour  maps  presented  in  the  ER  show  that  groundwater  in  the  alluvium 
and  the  Vincentown  aquifer  generally  flows  toward  the  Delaware  River.  For  the  September 
2009  sampling  period,  the  observation  wells  located  on  the  HCGS  and  SGS  were  included  in 
the  set  of  groundwater  head  data  for  the  alluvium.  The  head  contours  show  a  slight 
groundwater  mound  over  the  HCGS  site,  with  groundwater  flowing  outward,  generally  toward 
the  Delaware  River,  but  also  toward  the  marsh  to  the  northeast  of  the  PSEG  Site. 

Site-specific  groundwater  heads  in  the  deeper  aquifers  at  Artificial  Island  were  not  reported  in 
the  ER;  however,  heads,  pumping  rates,  and  salinity  data  for  SGS  and  HCGS  wells  were 
obtained  from  NJDEP  and  evaluated  by  the  review  team  (NJDEP  2013-TN3223).  Regionally, 
groundwater  heads  in  the  deeper  aquifers  are  influenced  by  the  large  regional  pumping  centers 
in  Camden,  Gloucester,  and  Salem  Counties,  New  Jersey,  and  in  New  Castle  County,  Delaware 
(dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948;  dePaul  and  Rosman  2015-TN4193).  At  the  PSEG  Site, 
groundwater  heads  in  the  middle  and  lower  PRM  aquifers  appear  to  be  affected  by  the  New 
Castle  County  withdrawals  (Plates  8  and  9,  dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948).  In  addition,  there  is  a 
local  depression  of  groundwater  head  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer  associated  with  HCGS  and 
SGS  groundwater  use  for  operations  (dePaul  and  Rosman  2015-TN4193).  The  head  measured 
in  USGS  observation  well  33-934  (site  observation  Well  J)  at  the  south  end  of  Artificial  Island 
was  -75  ft  in  2008,  a  drawdown  of  about  55  ft  below  the  apparent  regional  groundwater  head. 
Head  measured  in  this  well  varied  from  -47  to  -88  ft  NAVD88  during  2003  to  2013,  with  an 
average  value  of  -70  ft  NAVD88  during  this  period  (NJDEP  2013-TN3223).  Heads  in  other  site 
observation  wells  in  the  middle  PRM  and  lower  PRM  aquifers  also  varied  over  a  range  of  about 
40  ft  during  this  period  in  response  to  site  pumping  (NJDEP  2013-TN3223). 

The  horizontal  extent  of  drawdown  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer  from  groundwater  pumping  for 
HCGS  and  SGS  is  underestimated  in  dePaul  et  al.  (2009-TN2948)  and  in  dePaul  and 
Rosman  (2015-TN4193)  because  well  33-918,  shown  in  Plate  8  of  these  reports,  was 
mistakenly  included  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer  instead  of  in  the  lower  PRM  aquifer  where  it  is 
actually  completed.  Prior  5-year  synoptic  reports  show  a  greater  extent  of  drawdown  due  to  the 
HCGS  and  SGS  groundwater  pumping,  with  groundwater  elevations  of  -40  ft  extending  3  to

4  mi  from  HCGS/SGS  (Lacombe  and  Rosman  2001-TN4194;  Lacombe  and  Rosman  1997- 
TN4195;  Rosman  et  al.  1995-TN4196;  Eckel  and  Walker  1986-TN4197;  Walker  1983-TN4198). 

Aquifer  Material  Properties 

PSEG  evaluated  saturated  hydraulic  conductivity  by  completing  a  slug  test  in  eight  of  the 
observations  well  pairs  on  the  northern  portion  of  the  site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Average 
hydraulic  conductivity  values,  reported  in  ER  Table  2.3-17  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  were  about 
3.8  ft/d  in  the  alluvium  and  the  Vincentown  aquifer.  A  value  of  0.2  ft/d  was  reported  for  the 
single  well  installed  in  the  hydraulic  fill.  A  summary  of  hydraulic  properties  based  on  regional 
data  was  provided  in  SSAR  Table  2.4.12-1  for  all  of  the  hydrogeologic  units  identified  at  the  site 
(PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

Groundwater  Pathways 

A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  situated  in  an  area  of  low  topographic 
relief  adjacent  to  the  Delaware  River,  with  plant  excavation  extending  into  the  Vincentown 
aquifer.  Horizontal  hydraulic  gradients  are  small  in  the  Vincentown  aquifer  and  in  the  alluvium. 
Tidal  influence  on  groundwater  heads  is  prominent  near  the  Delaware  River,  but  the  general 
groundwater  flow  is  toward  the  river.  There  is  a  component  of  groundwater  flow  in  the  alluvium 
that  is  directed  to  the  northeast,  with  likely  discharge  to  the  marsh.  This  marsh  drains  to  the 
Delaware  River  via  Fishing  Creek  to  the  north  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Average  groundwater 
velocities  reported  in  the  ER  were  2.9  ft/yr  (in  the  northern  portion  of  the  site)  and  12.9  ft/yr  (in 
the  eastern  portion)  for  the  alluvium,  and  3.3  ft/yr  (in  the  northern  portion  of  the  site)  and  1 .7  ft/yr 
(in  the  eastern  portion)  for  the  Vincentown  aquifer  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Alternative 
groundwater  pathways  for  an  accidental  release  of  liquid  radioactive  effluents  are  discussed  in 
SSAR  2.4.13  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  The  staffs  evaluation  of  groundwater  pathways  and 
radionuclide  transport  will  be  documented  in  the  safety  evaluation  report  (SER)  (NRC  2015- 
TN4156). 

2.3.2  Water  Use 

This  subsection  describes  surface-water  and  groundwater  uses  that  could  affect  or  be  affected 
by  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Descriptions 
of  the  types  of  consumptive  and  nonconsumptive  water  uses,  identification  of  their  locations, 
and  quantification  of  water  withdrawals  and  returns  are  included  in  ER  Section  2.3  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  Water  use,  for  the  purposes  of  this  subsection,  is  broadly  defined,  encompassing 
human  water  supply  needs  for  drinking  and  domestic  uses,  industrial  uses,  and  agricultural 
uses.  It  also  includes  instream  uses  that  do  not  involve  water  diversion  such  as  navigation, 
recreation,  and  aquatic  habitat  needs  based  on  water  quality. 

2. 3. 2. 7  Surface-  Water  Use 

Water  Use  near  the  PSEG  Site 

The  waters  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  PSEG  Site,  at  approximately  Delaware 
RM  52,  are  brackish,  with  salinity  varying  seasonally  from  4  to  20  parts  per  thousand  (ppt) 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Major  consumptive  water  uses  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  are  those

for  HCGS  and  SGS.  HCGS  employs  a  closed-cycle  cooling  system.  The  average  HCGS 
withdrawal  from  the  Delaware  River  is  67  Mgd.  SGS  uses  a  once-through  circulating  water 
system.  The  SGS  intake  flow  is  limited  to  a  30-day  average  of  3,024  Mgd.  Because  SGS  uses 
a  once-through  cooling  system,  almost  all  of  the  withdrawn  water  is  returned  to  the  Delaware 
River  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Water  Use  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin 

As  decreed  by  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  in  1954,  the  City  of  New  York  has  rights  to 
withdraw  800  Mgd  of  water  from  the  Delaware  River  Basin  via  three  city-owned  headwater 
reservoirs:  Neversink,  Pepacton,  and  Cannonsville  (USGS  2004-TN2406).  The  Neversink, 
Pepacton,  and  Cannonsville  reservoirs  were  completed  in  1954,  1955,  and  1964,  respectively 
(NYCDEP  201 3-TN2409).  As  part  of  the  decree  and  agreement  among  the  States  of  New  York, 
New  Jersey,  Pennsylvania,  and  Delaware,  the  three  reservoirs  are  required  to  release  sufficient 
water  to  maintain  flow  objectives  of  1 ,750  and  3,000  cfs  at  Montague  and  Trenton,  New  Jersey, 
respectively.  An  out-of-basin,  100  Mgd  water  supply  to  central  and  northeastern  New  Jersey  is 
also  permitted  (USGS  2004-TN2406).  One  purpose  of  the  3000  cfs  target  flow  at  Trenton,  New 
Jersey,  is  to  maintain  the  salt  line  at  Delaware  RM  98,  downstream  of  public  water  supply 
intakes  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  The  salt  line  in  the  tidal  Delaware  River  is  a  location  where  the 
seven-day  average  chloride  concentration  equals  250  ppm  (DRBC  2008-TN2277). 

Within  the  Delaware  River  Basin,  over  8,736  Mgd  of  water,  including  surface  and  groundwater, 
are  used,  including  an  average  of  736  Mgd  exported  to  New  York  City  and  northeastern  New 
Jersey  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  Almost  90  percent  of  water  withdrawn  is  supplied  from  surface 
water  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  Within  the  basin,  65  percent  of  water  is  used  for  thermoelectric 
power  generation,  10  percent  is  used  for  public  water  supply,  7  percent  is  used  for  hydroelectric 
power  generation,  and  6  percent  is  used  for  industrial  purposes  (DRBC  2008-TN2277). 

Surface  water  accounts  for  64  percent  of  potable  water  supply,  and  groundwater  accounts  for 
the  remaining  36  percent  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  Ninety  percent  of  the  commercial  and 
residential  potable  water  is  supplied  by  public  water  supply  systems,  while  private  domestic 
wells  account  for  the  remaining  10  percent  (DRBC  2008-TN2277). 

The  DRBC  was  created  in  1961  through  signing  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  Compact  among 
the  Federal  Government  and  the  four  basin  States  of  New  York,  New  Jersey,  Pennsylvania,  and 
Delaware  (DRBC  2004-TN2278).  The  DRBC  is  responsible  for  protecting  water  quality, 
allocating  and  permitting  water  supply,  conserving  water  resources,  managing  drought,  reducing 
flood  losses,  and  developing  recreation  in  the  basin  (DRBC  2012-TN2279).  A  resolution  by  the 
governors  of  the  four  basin  states  in  1999  directed  the  development  of  a  comprehensive  water 
resources  plan  for  the  Delaware  River  Basin  (DRBC  2004-TN2278).  This  goal-based  plan  was 
developed  around  five  key  areas:  to  manage  the  quantity  and  quality  of  the  basin’s  waters  for 
sustainable  use;  to  manage  waterways  to  reduce  flood  losses,  improve  recreation,  and  protect, 
conserve,  and  restore  riparian  and  aquatic  ecosystems;  to  integrate  water  resources 
management  into  land-use  planning  and  growth  management;  to  strengthen  partnership  among 
stakeholders;  and  to  provide  stewardship  for  protection,  improvement,  and  restoration  of  water 
resources  (DRBC  2004-TN2278).  The  plan  defines  a  set  of  objectives  to  achieve  the  stated 
goals  (DRBC  2004-TN2278).

2. 3. 2. 2  Groundwater  Use 

The  New  Jersey  Coastal  Plain  is  a  major  source  of  groundwater  for  the  southern  half  of  New 
Jersey  and  is  the  primary  source  for  public  water  systems  in  Salem,  Gloucester,  and 
Cumberland  counties.  A  detailed  description  of  the  major  water  users  in  this  region  was 
supplied  in  the  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  including  a  list  of  groundwater  users  within  a  25-mi 
radius  of  the  PSEG  Site  that  are  permitted  for  withdrawal  of  more  than  1 00,000  gpd  (PSEG 
2015-TN4280).  Across  the  Delaware  River  in  New  Castle  County,  Delaware,  about  one-quarter 
of  the  public  water  is  obtained  from  a  groundwater  supply  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The 
Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  and  PRM  aquifer  systems  are  the  principal  sources  of  potable  water  in 
the  southern  region  of  New  Jersey  and  in  New  Castle  County,  Delaware  (dePaul  et  al.  2009- 
TN2948). 

The  locations  of  public  water  supply  wells  in  New  Jersey  and  wellhead  protection  areas  in  New 
Jersey  and  Delaware  within  a  25-mi  radius  of  the  PSEG  Site  are  reported  in  ER  Figure  2.3-20 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Water  withdrawal  rates  and  well  depth  information  are  provided  for 
public  water  supply  wells  that  do  not  fall  within  wellhead  protection  areas.  This  information  is 
not  available  for  wells  located  in  a  wellhead  protection  area  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

PSEG  stated  that  “there  are  no  offsite  public  water  supply  wells  or  private  wells  within  2  mi  of 
the  PSEG  Site”  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  nearest  groundwater-use  location  shown  on  ER 
Figure  2.3-20  is  a  wellhead  protection  area  approximately  3.0  mi  from  the  PSEG  Site,  across 
the  Delaware  River  in  New  Castle  County,  Delaware.  The  nearest  groundwater-use  location  in 
Salem  County  that  is  shown  on  ER  Figure  2.3-20  is  a  public  water  supply  well  approximately 
5.0  mi  from  the  PSEG  Site.  The  nearest  domestic  residences  in  Salem  County  are  located  on 
Alloway  Creek  Neck  Road  approximately  3.0  mi  from  the  PSEG  Site. 

Groundwater  is  the  only  source  of  freshwater  at  the  PSEG  Site,  and  PSEG  has  authorization 
from  NJDEP  (NJDEP  2012-TN3222)  and  DRBC  for  consumptive  use  of  up  to 

43.2  million  gallons  of  groundwater  per  month  (but  no  more  than  300  million  gal/yr)  to  support 
the  combined  operations  at  HCGS  and  SGS.  There  is  a  maximum  diversion  rate  of  2,900  gpm 
for  these  two  plants.  The  groundwater  is  used  for  potable,  industrial  process  makeup,  fire 
protection,  and  sanitary  purposes. 

Past  rates  of  groundwater  use  at  HCGS  and  SGS  were  obtained  from  the  ER  and  from  NJDEP 
records  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  NJDEP  2013-TN3223).  HCGS  derives  groundwater  from  two 
wells  installed  to  depths  of  816  ft  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer  (referred  to  in  the  ER  as  the  Upper 
Raritan  Formation  of  the  PRM  aquifer)  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  average  combined  pumping 
rate  from  these  wells  was  148  gpm  for  the  period  2002  to  2012.  SGS  derives  groundwater 
primarily  from  two  wells  installed  to  depths  of  840  and  1 ,135  ft  in  the  middle  and  lower  PRM 
aquifers  (referred  to  in  the  ER  as  the  Upper  and  Middle  Raritan  Formations  of  the  PRM  aquifer). 
Average  pumping  rates  between  2002  and  2012  were  206  and  31  gpm  from  the  middle  and 
lower  PRM  aquifers,  respectively.  SGS  also  has  two  wells  installed  in  the  Wenonah-Mount 
Laurel  aquifer.  These  wells  are  classified  as  standby  wells,  and  only  a  negligible  amount  of 
water  was  pumped  from  these  wells  during  2002  to  2012.

2.3.3  Water  Quality 

The  following  sections  describe  the  quality  of  surface-water  and  groundwater  resources  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site. 

2. 3. 3. 7  Surface -  Water  Quality 

Water  Quality  Near  the  PSEG  Site 

The  water  quality  of  the  Delaware  River  near  the  PSEG  Site  is  influenced  by  tidal  action, 
wind-induced  circulation,  and  freshwater  discharges  primarily  from  the  Delaware  River. 
Maximum  turbidity  within  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  occurs  near  the  location  of  the  PSEG  Site 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  DRBC  water-quality  requirements  (18  CFR  Part  410-TN3235),  as  well 
as  requirements  specified  in  New  Jersey  Administrative  Code  7:9B-1.14  (NJAC  7:9B-TN4286), 
apply  to  the  Delaware  River  near  the  PSEG  Site. 

PSEG  collected  quarterly  surface-water-quality  samples  at  1 1  locations  in  the  Delaware  River, 
the  desilt  basins  at  the  PSEG  Site,  and  Hope  and  Alloway  Creeks  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Figure  2-19  shows  these  surface-water-quality  sampling  locations.  The  Delaware  River 
sampling  location  is  AS-08.  The  applicant  analyzed  the  surface-water  samples  for  suspended 
solids,  total  dissolved  solids,  hardness,  biochemical  oxygen  demand,  chemical  oxygen  demand, 
phosphorus,  various  forms  of  nitrogen,  alkalinity,  chlorides,  inorganics  (i.e. ,  calcium,  sodium, 
potassium,  magnesium,  lead,  mercury,  and  zinc),  coliform,  and  phytoplankton  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

PSEG  also  measured  temperature,  dissolved  oxygen,  salinity,  color,  turbidity,  pH,  and  specific 
conductivity  in  the  field  at  the  surface-water-quality  sampling  locations  and  analyzed  the 
samples  for  tritium  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

PSEG  sampled  three  locations  quarterly  in  the  desilt  basins  present  on  the  proposed  PSEG  Site 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Salinity  ranged  from  1  to  2  ppt  with  a  mean  of  1.1  ppt,  fecal  coliform 
ranged  from  1  to  90  colonies  per  100  mL,  pH  was  between  5.9  and  8.1  with  a  mean  of  7.3,  and 
turbidity  ranged  from  10.1  to  712  nephelometric  turbidity  units  (NTU)  with  a  mean  of  about  124 
NTU.  All  sampled  inorganics  except  mercury  were  present.  Tritium  was  detected  in  one 
sample,  but  the  reported  concentration  was  below  the  laboratory  reporting  limit.  Tritium  was  not 
detected  in  subsequent  samplings,  and  because  the  location  is  not  along  the  migration  pathway 
for  HCGS  or  SGS,  the  applicant  reported  the  single  tritium  detection  as  a  false  positive  (PSEG 
2015-TN4280).  Analytical  results  for  the  desilt  basins  water-quality  samples  were  summarized 
in  ER  Table  2.3-26  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

The  Delaware  River  and  Estuary 

The  salt  line  (defined  as  a  chloride  concentration  of  250  mg/L)  is  an  important  indicator  to 
ensure  that  public  water  supplies  would  not  be  affected  by  the  presence  of  brackish  water.  The 
salt  line  moves  in  response  to  the  tides  and  variations  in  Delaware  River  freshwater  discharge. 
During  most  of  the  year  the  salt  line  is  located  between  the  Commodore  Barry  Bridge  at 
Delaware  RM  82  and  Reedy  Island  at  Delaware  RM  54  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  During  the 
drought  of  record  in  the  1960s,  the  salt  line  moved  to  its  most  upstream  historically  observed 
location  at  Delaware  RM  102  (DRBC  2014-TN321 1 ). 

As  of  February  13,  2014,  the  salt  line  was  approximately  at  the  Delaware  Memorial  Bridge 
at  RM  70.  For  comparison,  the  PSEG  Site  is  at  RM  54  in  the  tidal  portion  of  the  Delaware 
River,  and  average  seawater  chloride  concentration  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  35,000  mg/L. 

The  PSEG  SSAR  reports  a  range  in  the  chloride  concentration  in  the  Delaware  estuary  of  5,000 
to  15,000  mg/L  depending  on  the  season  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  Chloride  concentrations  in  the 
Delaware  River  vary  widely  during  the  course  of  a  year.  During  wetter  times  of  the  year,  such 
as  late  winter  and  early  spring,  the  salt  line  is  normally  located  farther  downstream  in  the  river. 

The  five  years  between  1999  and  2003  contained  a  mix  of  wet  periods  (2000  and  2003)  and  dry 
periods  (1999,  2001,  and  2002).  During  this  time,  the  salt  line  ranged  from  below  RM  54  (the 
furthest  downstream  location  the  DRBC  measures)  to  as  high  as  RM  89.  During  the  wettest 
years,  the  250  mg/L  chloride  concentration  stayed  at  or  below  the  normal  midmonth  locations 
for  most  of  the  year.  For  example,  in  2003,  annual  rainfall  surpluses  of  more  than  20  in.  in 
some  parts  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  kept  stream  flows  above  normal  for  much  of  the  year. 
As  a  result,  chlorides  in  the  river  were  kept  so  diluted  that  the  salt  line  location  was  consistently 
below  the  normal  location  (sometimes  by  as  much  as  30  mi)  from  June  through  December 
(DRBC  2004-TN3209). 

Since  1996,  every  two  years  DRBC  publishes  a  water-quality  assessment  report  for  the 
Delaware  River  and  Bay  (DRBC  201 2-TN2279).  The  most  recent  of  these  reports  was 
published  in  March  2012.  These  reports  contain  DRBC’s  water-quality  assessment  consistent 
with  Section  305(b)  of  the  Clean  Water  Act  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  and  are  used  by  the 
four  basin  states  for  consideration  in  preparation  of  their  lists  of  water  bodies  per  Section  303(d) 
of  the  Clean  Water  Act  (DRBC  201 2-TN2279).  The  DRBC  water-quality  standards  require  that 
all  surface  waters  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  should  be  maintained  for  six  uses:  agricultural, 
industrial,  and  public  water  supplies  after  reasonable  treatment  except  where  natural  salinity 
prevents  such  uses;  use  by  wildlife,  fish,  and  other  aquatic  life;  recreation;  navigation;  waste 
assimilation  such  that  other  uses  are  still  possible;  and  other  uses  that  the  DRBC’s 
comprehensive  plan  may  specify  (DRBC  2012-TN2279). 

The  DRBC  has  divided  the  Delaware  River  and  Bay  into  a  total  of  10  water-quality  management 
zones:  Zones  1 A  through  1 E  comprise  the  nontidal  portion  of  the  main  stem  Delaware  River 
upstream  of  Trenton,  New  Jersey;  Zones  2  through  5  are  located  in  the  tidal  portion  of  the  river 
downstream  of  Trenton,  New  Jersey;  and  Zone  6  is  the  Delaware  Bay  (DRBC  2012-TN2279). 
DRBC  designates  the  use  of  Zones  1 ,  2,  and  3  for  “public  water  supplies  after  reasonable 
treatment.”  The  DRBC-designated  uses  for  Zones  1 A  through  1 E  are  aquatic  life,  public  water 
supply,  recreation,  and  fish  consumption.  The  designated  uses  in  Zones  2  through  5  are

aquatic  life,  recreation,  and  fish  consumption.  In  Zones  2  and  3,  DRBC  additionally  specifies 
permissible  levels  of  specific  toxics  to  support  drinking  water  and  fish  consumption.  The 
designated  uses  for  Zone  6  are  aquatic  life,  recreation,  and  fish  and  shellfish  consumption 
(DRBC  2012-TN2279).  The  PSEG  Site  is  located  in  Zone  5,  which  extends  from  Delaware  RM 
48.2  to  78.8. 

In  the  2012  water-quality  assessment  report,  the  DRBC  lists  Zone  5  as  not  supporting  aquatic 
life  designated  use  (DRBC  2012-TN2279).  For  Zone  5,  DRBC  reported  that  96  percent  of  the 
dissolved  oxygen  observations  met  daily  mean  criterion,  and  all  of  the  observations  met  the 
seasonal  mean  criterion  (DRBC  2012-TN2279).  All  of  the  pH  observations  in  Zone  5  met  the 
criterion  for  Zone  5;  however,  only  37  percent  of  the  turbidity  observations  met  the 
instantaneous  maximum  criterion,  and  none  met  the  30-day  average  criterion  for  turbidity 
(DRBC  2012-TN2279).  DRBC  states  the  turbidity  conditions  in  Zone  5  may  be  related  to  the 
natural  occurrence  of  the  estuary  turbidity  maximum  within  the  zone.  In  Zone  5,  nearly 
99  percent  of  observations  met  the  temperature  criterion,  and  all  of  the  observations  met  the 
alkalinity  criterion.  Zone  5  does  not  have  a  criterion  for  total  dissolved  solids.  DRBC  reported 
exceedances  for  copper  and  methyl  mercury  in  Zone  5  (DRBC  2012-TN2279).  The  DRBC  also 
reported  that  Zone  5  met  all  criteria  for  primary  and  secondary  contact  recreation  and  therefore 
supports  recreation  use  (DRBC  2012-TN2279).  The  State  of  Delaware  issued  fish  consumption 
advisories  in  Zone  5  due  to  polychlorinated  biphenyls  (PCBs)  and  mercury  (DRBC  2012- 
TN2279).  Overall,  DRBC  reported  in  its  2012  water-quality  assessment  report  that  Zone  5  did 
not  support  aquatic  life  and  fish  consumption  but  did  support  recreation  (DRBC  2012-TN2279). 

PSEG  performed  quarterly  surface-water-quality  sampling  in  the  Delaware  River  adjacent  to  the 
proposed  site,  as  shown  in  Figure  2-19  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Salinity  ranged  from  4  to  14  ppt 
with  a  mean  of  8.2  ppt,  fecal  coliform  ranged  from  6  colonies  per  100  mL  to  too  numerous  to 
count,  pH  was  between  4.7  and  8.4  with  a  mean  of  6.5,  and  turbidity  ranged  from 
39.5  to  381  NTU  with  a  mean  of  150  NTU.  Tritium  was  not  detected  during  the  sampling  period. 
Of  the  inorganics,  mercury  was  not  detected  during  the  sampling  period  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 
Delaware  River  sample  analytical  results  were  summarized  in  ER  Table  2.3-25  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

Marsh  Locations  Near  the  PSEG  Site 

PSEG  performed  quarterly  surface-water-quality  sampling  at  seven  locations  within  tidal 
marshes  on  and  near  the  PSEG  Site.  Salinity  ranged  from  1  to  9  ppt  with  a  mean  of  3.4  ppt, 
fecal  coliform  ranged  from  1  colony  per  100  mL  to  too  numerous  to  count,  pH  ranged  from  4.7  to 
8.6  with  a  mean  of  6.8,  and  turbidity  ranged  from  about  26  to  449  NTU  with  a  mean  of  about 
117  NTU.  Of  the  inorganics,  mercury  was  not  detected.  Tritium  was  detected  once  near  the 
southeastern  edge  of  the  PSEG  Site,  but  the  reported  concentration  was  below  the  laboratory 
reporting  limit,  and  because  the  location  is  not  along  the  migration  pathway  for  HCGS  or  SGS, 
the  applicant  reported  the  single  tritium  detection  as  a  false  positive  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
Analytical  results  for  the  marsh  water-quality  samples  were  summarized  in  ER  Table  2.3-26 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).

Delaware  River  Sediment  Near  the  PS  EG  Site 

PSEG  obtained  sediment  samples  from  the  Delaware  River  at  eight  locations  near  the  PSEG 
Site  (see  Figure  2-19  for  sample  locations).  However,  these  samples  were  only  analyzed  for 
particle  size  distribution.  The  review  team  examined  the  Delaware  Estuary  Regional  Sediment 
Management  Plan  final  report  (DERSMPW  2013-TN4204)  for  information  characterizing  the 
quality  of  sediment  in  Delaware  River  Water  Quality  Zone  5.  About  55  percent  of  the  231 
samples  in  Zone  5  were  classified  as  probably  or  potentially  suitable  for  aquatic  habitat  use. 
About  98  percent  of  the  231  samples  were  classified  as  suitable  or  probably  suitable  for  upland 
beneficial  use.  The  most  prevalent  contaminants  of  concern  were  arsenic,  lead,  mercury,  and 
PCBs.  Two  samples  in  the  regional  database  were  from  just  offshore  of  Artificial  Island,  near 
the  proposed  plant  intake  structure  area.  These  samples  had  lead  and  arsenic  concentrations 
above  the  lower  effects  thresholds  and  were  determined  to  be  probably  suitable  for  aquatic 
habitat  use  and  suitable  for  upland  beneficial  use. 

2. 3.3.2  G round wa  ter  Quality 

Groundwater  quality  was  measured  quarterly  during  2009  in  the  16  observation  well  pairs 
installed  in  the  hydraulic  fill  and  the  alluvium  and  Vincentown  formations  to  support  development 
of  the  ESP  application.  These  shallow  water-bearing  zones  are  nonpotable  due  to  their  direct 
connection  with  the  saline  Delaware  River  and  are  most  likely  to  be  impacted  by  construction 
and  surficial  releases.  Groundwater  analytical  results  for  the  ESP  application  are  summarized 
in  ER  Tables  2.3-28  to  2.3-31  for  the  alluvium  and  Vincentown  aquifer  samples  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  Minimum,  maximum,  and  mean  measured  values  were  reported  for  suspended 
solids,  total  dissolved  solids,  hardness  as  calcium  carbonate  (CaCOs),  biochemical  oxygen 
demand,  chemical  oxygen  demand,  phosphorus,  nitrogen  forms,  alkalinity,  chloride,  selected 
inorganics  (calcium,  iron,  sodium,  potassium,  magnesium,  lead  and  mercury),  coliform,  carbon 
dioxide,  silica  tritium,  temperature,  dissolved  oxygen,  salinity,  color,  turbidity,  pH,  and  specific 
conductance.  The  results  of  these  analyses  indicate  the  groundwater  in  these  aquifers  is  saline 
and  not  potable.  Chloride  concentrations  in  the  alluvium  averaged  2,900  mg/L  in  the  northern 
portion  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  3,500  mg/L  in  the  eastern  portion  of  the  site.  Average  chloride 
concentrations  in  the  Vincentown  aquifer  were  4,500  mg/L  (northern  wells)  and  5,600  mg/L 
(eastern  wells).  Since  the  New  Jersey  secondary  drinking  water  standard  (DWS)  for  chloride  is 
250  mg/L,  these  wells  are  considered  nonpotable.  Tritium  was  detected  in  two  alluvium  water 
samples  at  concentrations  of  340  and  710  pCi/L.  These  samples  were  from  different  wells  and 
at  different  times,  indicating  the  absence  of  a  persistent  or  widespread  tritium  plume.  The  ER 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280)  states  that  the  positive  tritium  measurements  were  likely  false  positives 
because  the  values  are  very  close  to  the  laboratory  detection  limits.  In  addition,  the  EPA  DWS 
for  tritium  is  20,000  pCi/L. 

In  addition  to  the  ESP  application  groundwater  monitoring  effort,  PSEG  maintains  a  Radiological 
Groundwater  Protection  Program  (RGPP)  and  Tritium  Remediation  Monitoring  Wells.  These 
wells  were  installed  for  the  RGPP  at  HCGS  and  SGS  for  tritium  remediation  monitoring  at  SGS. 
They  are  located  in  the  shallow  water-bearing  strata  and  the  Vincentown  aquifer,  consistent  with 
the  wells  installed  in  conjunction  with  the  ESP  application  effort.

Affected  Environment 


Tritium  was  discovered  at  concentrations  above  the  EPA  DWS  (20,000  pCi/L)  in  the  shallow 
groundwater  near  SGS  Unit  1  in  early  2003  and  attributed  to  a  release  of  water  from  the  spent 
fuel  pool.  Groundwater  extraction  was  begun  in  early  2005  to  provide  control  of  groundwater 
flow  and  to  remove  tritiated  groundwater.  More  than  3  Ci  of  tritium  have  been  removed  by  the 
system,  and  it  is  estimated  that  0.1  to  1.0  Ci  of  tritium  still  remains  in  groundwater  and  dead  end 
pore  spaces  (ARCADIS  2012-TN3310).  The  mass  of  tritium  discharged  from  groundwater  to 
the  Delaware  River  was  estimated  to  be  0.128  Ci  during  the  first  quarter  of  2014  (ARCADIS 
2014-TN4207).  The  source  of  the  release  of  tritium-contaminated  water  to  the  environment  has 
been  controlled  by  clearing  and  maintaining  the  SGS  Unit  1  spent  fuel  pool  telltale  drains  and  by 
periodically  draining  the  seismic  gap  between  the  SGS  Unit  1  fuel  handling  and  auxiliary 
buildings,  where  water  from  the  spent  fuel  pool  has  migrated  (ARCADIS  2014-TN4207). 

In  general,  since  remediation  pumping  efforts  began,  the  concentrations  in  wells  installed  inside 
and  outside  the  Unit  1  cofferdam  have  declined,  and  most  concentrations  are  at  or  below  50 
percent  of  the  EPA  DWS.  Several  wells  remain  above  the  DWS,  and  monitoring  and  extraction 
activities  are  continuing.  One  well  near  the  reactor  building  (i.e.,  Well  AC)  remains  at  more  than 
10  times  the  EPA  DWS.  Extracted  groundwater  is  managed  according  to  the  current  SGS  NRC 
license  (ARCADIS  2012-TN3310). 

In  response  to  the  tritium  contamination  of  the  shallow  groundwater,  a  monitoring  well  was 
installed  in  the  Vincentown  aquifer  at  a  location  downgradient  of  the  spent  fuel  pool  release  (i.e., 
Well  AA-V).  Elevated  tritium  concentrations  were  measured  in  Well  AA-V.  Between  June  2013 
and  March  2014  the  tritium  concentration  in  Well  AA-V  varied  from  6,900  to  12,800  pCi/L 
(ARCADIS  2014-TN4207). 

In  contrast  to  SGS  Unit  1 ,  SGS  Unit  2  has  not  had  a  major  subsurface  release  of  tritium; 
however,  SGS  Unit  2  also  has  a  tritium  monitoring  system  of  ten  wells  installed  in  response  to 
detection  of  elevated  tritium  concentrations  in  a  catch  basin.  Monitoring  well  concentrations 
around  SGS  Unit  2  increased  during  a  high  precipitation  period  from  July  to  August  201 1  but 
have  since  returned  to  their  historical  concentrations  of  less  than  50  percent  of  the  EPA  DWS 
(ARCADIS  2012-TN3310;  ARCADIS  2014-TN4207). 

The  deeper  aquifers,  including  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  and  the  PRM,  are  used  as  potable 
sources  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  are  designated  by  EPA  as  sole  source  aquifers.  These  aquifers 
are  hydraulically  separated  from  the  upper  aquifers  by  a  series  of  confining  layers,  so  that  the 
water  quality  in  these  aquifers  is  not  likely  to  be  impacted  by  activities  limited  to  the  depth  of  the 
Vincentown  aquifer.  However,  saltwater  intrusion  in  the  deeper  aquifers,  which  is  influenced  by 
large-scale  groundwater  pumping,  is  an  ongoing  concern  (Cauller  et  al.  1999-TN2995).  As 
reported  in  the  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  chloride  samples  are  routinely  taken  from  the  water 
withdrawn  from  the  deeper  aquifers  as  part  of  HCGS  and  SGS  operation,  with  water-quality 
data  reported  to  the  NJDEP  in  accordance  with  Water  Allocation  Permit  120001 .  Quarterly 
chloride  data  reported  to  the  NJDEP  for  the  period  2003  to  2013  were  reviewed  and  are  plotted 
in  Figure  2-20.  With  notable  deviations,  the  chloride  concentrations  have  been  stable  over  time. 
Water  from  the  lower  PRM  aquifer  (PW-6)  has  a  much  higher  chloride  concentration  but  has 
generally  been  less  than  250  mg/L.

for  the  Period  2003-2013  (Source:  NJDEP  2013-TN3223) 


Actual  concentrations  at  these  wells  were  10  to  60  percent  less  than  those  predicted  by  Run  4 
of  the  1 987  Dames  and  Moore  modeling  effort  for  the  year  2007,  after  20  years  of  pumping  at 
over  twice  the  average  historic  pumping  rate  (875  vs.  379  gpm)  (Dames  and  Moore  1988- 
TN331 1 ).  An  evaluation  of  the  predicted  impacts  of  increased  pumping  during  construction  and 
operation  on  salinity  is  contained  in  Sections  4.2  and  5.2,  respectively. 

2.3.4  Water  Monitoring 

PSEG  was  able  to  consider  the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  monitoring  programs  as  part  of  the 
pre-application  monitoring  program  for  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  If  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  is  built  at  the  PSEG  Site,  many  of  these  same  monitoring  activities  would 
be  continued,  and  additional  monitoring  near  a  new  plant  could  be  added  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

PSEG  performed  surface-water-quality  monitoring  on  and  near  the  PSEG  Site  as  described  in 
Section  2.3.3. 1.  Monitoring  of  stream  discharges  and  surface-water-quality  assessments  are 
performed  by  USGS  as  described  in  Section  2.3.1.  DRBC  performs  extensive  water-quality 
monitoring  as  part  of  its  water-quality  assessment  reports  as  described  in  Section  2.3.3. 1 . 

PSEG  installed  16  observation  well  pairs  in  late  2008  through  January  2009  to  support 
development  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  new  wells  were  installed  on  both  the  northern  portion  of  the 
PSEG  Site,  where  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  located,  and  on  the  eastern  portion  of 
the  PSEG  Site,  which  may  be  used  as  support  and/or  laydown  areas  during  construction. 
Groundwater  heads  were  measured  monthly  during  2009  in  the  hydraulic  fill,  alluvium,  and 
Vincentown  aquifer,  as  described  in  Section  2. 3. 1.2.  These  data  were  used,  in  conjunction  with 
existing  data  from  the  PSEG  Site,  to  prepare  groundwater  potentiometric  surface  maps. 
Quarterly  measurements  of  groundwater  quality  were  made  in  2009,  as  described  in 
Section  2. 3. 3. 2.  Other  than  this  quarterly  monitoring  event  for  the  ESP  application,  PSEG

continues  to  monitor  the  tritium-impacted  monitoring  wells  monthly  (ARCADIS  2012-TN3310) 
and  the  water  supply  wells  quarterly  for  chlorides  (NJDEP  2012-TN3222). 

2.4  Ecology 

This  section  describes  the  terrestrial,  aquatic,  and  wetland  ecology  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity 
that  could  be  affected  by  the  building,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant.  Most  of  the  PSEG  Site  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  on  the  east  bank 
of  the  Delaware  River  adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek 
Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  This  county  is  in  southwestern  New  Jersey,  within  the 
Outer  Coastal  Plain  subdivision  of  the  Coastal  Plain  physiographic  province. 

Section  2.4.1  provides  a  general  description  of  the  terrestrial  environment,  while  Section  2.4.2 
provides  a  general  description  of  the  aquatic  environments,  on  and  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG 
Site,  as  well  as  the  corridor  for  the  proposed  causeway.  Detailed  descriptions  are  provided 
where  needed  to  support  the  analysis  of  potential  environmental  impacts  from  building, 
operating,  and  maintaining  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  causeway.  These  descriptions  also 
support  the  evaluation  of  mitigation  activities  and  monitoring  programs  identified  during  the 
assessment  to  avoid,  reduce,  minimize,  rectify,  or  compensate  for  potential  impacts. 

2.4.1  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Ecology 

This  section  identifies  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecological  resources  and  describes  species 
composition  and  other  structural  and  functional  attributes  of  the  biota  that  could  be  affected  by 
building,  operating,  and  maintaining  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  the 
proposed  causeway.  It  also  identifies  important  terrestrial  resources,  such  as  wildlife 
sanctuaries  and  natural  areas,  that  might  be  affected  by  the  proposed  action. 

The  entire  819-ac  PSEG  Site  is  within  the  Outer  Coastal  Plain  subdivision  of  the  Coastal  Plain 
physiographic  province.  The  site  is  also  within  the  Middle  Atlantic  Coastal  Plain  of  the  eastern 
temperate  forest  ecoregion.  This  ecoregion  is  a  flat  plain,  with  many  swampy  or  marshy  areas 
(Ator  et  al.  2005-TN2745).  Forest  cover  in  the  region  is  predominantly  loblolly  and  shortleaf 
pine  with  patches  of  oak,  gum,  and  cypress  near  major  streams,  as  compared  to  the  mainly 
longleaf  and  slash  pine  forests  of  the  warmer  Southern  Coastal  Plain  (Wiken  et  al.  2011- 
TN2744).  Specific  ecological  communities  present  in  the  Outer  Coastal  Plain  in  New  Jersey 
include  southern  mixed  oak  forest,  upland  pine  forest,  upland  oak  forest,  pine  plains,  red  maple 
and  sweet  gum  forest,  Virginia  pine  successional  forest,  coastal  white  cedar  forest,  pitch  pine 
lowland  forest,  hardwood  swamp,  pine  barrens  shrub  swamp,  emergent  marsh,  freshwater  tidal 
marsh,  pine  barrens  savannah,  salt  marsh,  coastal  dune  grassland,  coastal  dune  shrubland, 
coastal  dune  forest,  and  successional  communities  (CU  2010-TN2886). 

2.4. 7. 7  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Resources — Site  and  Vicinity 

Existing  Cover  Types  and  Vegetation 

Baseline  habitat  conditions  for  the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity  were  developed  using  historical 
studies  and  surveys  in  support  of  HCGS  and  SGS  licensing  and  supplemental  information 
provided  by  resource  agencies  and  surveys  conducted  in  2009  to  2010.  Floral  surveys  were 


NUREG-2168

November  2015 


Affected  Environment 


conducted  during  the  2009  growing  season  on  the  PSEG  Site  to  confirm  the  land  cover  types 
mapped  by  NJDEP.  The  floral  surveys  were  completed  along  eight  walking  transects  covering 
each  vegetation  cover  type  during  the  spring,  summer,  and  fall  to  account  for  variations  in 
growing  seasons.  The  presence  of  each  plant  species  was  recorded  along  transects,  and  the 
relative  abundance  was  classified  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Site 

Vegetation  communities,  also  referred  to  as  vegetation  cover  types,  were  identified  from  NJDEP 
LULC  data  for  the  PSEG  Site  and  offsite  areas  that  potentially  would  be  affected  by  the 
proposed  causeway  (Figure  2-4  and  Figure  2-5).  Six  vegetative  cover  types  were  identified: 
urban  or  built-up  land,  agricultural  land,  forest  land,  water,  wetlands,  barren  land,  and  managed 
wetlands.  Table  2-1  lists  the  area  and  percentage  of  the  PSEG  Site  represented  by  each  LULC 
type  available  within  the  PSEG  Site  boundary.  The  listed  coverage  types  are  common  within 
the  Outer  Coastal  Plain  subdivision  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

PSEG  conducted  a  field  survey  along  eight  walking  transects  during  the  2009  growing  season 
in  each  habitat  represented  on  the  PSEG  Site,  proposed  causeway,  and  existing  access  road 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Plant  species  and  relative  abundance  were  recorded  along  each 
transect.  The  six  cover  types  are  described  in  the  following  sections  in  order  of  decreasing 
extent  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Urban  or  Built-Up  Land  (Developed  Lands) — Urban  and  built-up  land  includes  the  following 
cover  types  identified  by  NJDEP  as  occurring  on  the  PSEG  Site:  industrial, 
transportation/communication/utilities,  wetlands  ROWs,  upland  ROWs  (developed),  upland 
ROWs  (undeveloped),  other  urban  or  built-up  land,  Phragmites-dommaied  urban  area,  and 
recreational  land.  Land  use  in  this  category  is  characterized  as  having  been  altered  by  human 
activities  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  Most  of  these  lands  on  the  PSEG  Site  are  related  to  power 
generation  at  HCGS  and  SGS  and  associated  structures.  The  urban  or  built-up  coverage  type 
accounts  for  358  ac  or  44  percent  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  is  located  mainly  on  the  west  side  of 
Artificial  Island  and  on  the  north  end  of  the  proposed  causeway  near  Money  Island  Road. 

Upland  ROWs  (undeveloped)  support  shrubby  vegetation  but  are  considered  under  the  urban  or 
built-up  land  category  as  a  result  of  vegetation  maintenance  practices  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Included  in  this  category  are  two  wetlands  subcategories:  wetland  ROWs  and  Phragmites- 
dominated  urban  area.  Wetland  ROWs  are  included  in  this  category  because  they  exhibit 
hydric  soils,  but  as  a  result  of  alterations  may  not  support  vegetation  typical  of  natural  wetlands 
(NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  Wetland  ROWs  account  for  23.8  ac  or  3  percent  of  the  site,  and 
Phragmites- dominated  urban  areas  account  for  0.5  ac  or  less  than  1  percent  of  the  site.  This 
type  of  land  use  provides  limited  habitat  for  wildlife  use  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Wetlands — The  wetlands  category  includes  areas  inundated  or  saturated  by  surface  waters  or 
groundwaters  at  a  frequency  and  duration  sufficient  to  support,  and  that  under  normal 
circumstances  do  support,  a  prevalence  of  vegetation  typically  adapted  for  life  in  saturated  soil 
conditions.  This  category  does  not  include  wetlands  that  have  been  modified  for  recreation, 
agriculture,  or  industry  that  are  described  under  specific  use  categories  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887). 
This  habitat  is  located  predominantly  on  the  north  and  northeast  portions  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The 
wetlands  category  accounts  for  284.9  ac  or  35  percent  of  the  site’s  total  available  habitat  (PSEG 
2015-TN4280).

Affected  Environment 


Wetlands  influenced  by  the  tidal  portions  of  the  Delaware  River  system  and  the  tidal  portions  of 
the  watercourses  draining  into  the  Atlantic  Ocean  are  categorized  as  coastal  wetlands 
(NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  Coastal  wetlands  found  on  the  site  include  saline  marshes  and 
P/7r3g/77/tes-dominated  coastal  wetlands.  Saline  marshes  are  associated  with  waters  with 
salinities  greater  than  1  ppt  and  are  open  graminoid  dominated  regions.  Saltmarsh  cordgrass 
( Spartina  alterniflora)  dominates  these  wetlands  in  areas  of  high  salinity.  Brackish  marshes  are 
co-dominated  by  big  cordgrass  ( Spartina  cynosuroides),  saltmarsh  cordgrass,  common  reed 
( Phragmites  australis ),  narrowleaf  cattail  ( Typha  angustifolia),  and  common  threesquare 
( Schoenoplectus  pungens ).  Salt  marshes  account  for  0.2  ac  or  less  than  1  percent  of  the  site 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  introduction  of  the  invasive  species  Phragmites  australis  displaces 
native  wetland  species,  degrading  habitat  diversity.  Phragmites-6orr\\na\e6  coastal  wetlands 
are  marsh  areas  dominated  by  Phragmites  australis  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  Phragmites- 
dominated  coastal  wetlands  are  the  most  common  wetland  type  found  on  the  site,  accounting 
for  155.6  ac  or  19  percent  of  the  site’s  vegetation  cover  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Isolated  wetlands  and  wetlands  generally  found  in  nontidal  lowlands  influenced  by  primary, 
secondary,  and  tertiary  courses  are  categorized  as  interior  wetlands  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887). 
Interior  Wetlands  found  on  the  PSEG  Site  include  deciduous  scrub/shrub  wetlands,  herbaceous 
wetlands,  and  Phra g mites- dominated  interior  wetlands.  Deciduous  scrub/shrub  wetlands  may  be 
composed  of  young  saplings  of  tree  species  such  as  red  maple  {Acer  rubrum),  ashleaf  maple 
{Acer  negundo),  sweetgum  {Liquidambar  styraciflua),  and  shrub  species  such  as  silky  dogwood 
{Cornus  amomum ),  red-osier  dogwood  (C.  sericea),  gray  dogwood  (C.  racemosa),  white 
meadowsweet  {Spiraea  alba),  steeplebush  (S.  tomentosa),  arrow-wood  {Viburnum  dentatum), 
and  hazel  alder  {Alnus  serrulata ).  This  category  also  includes  bogs  that  are  dominated  by 
Ericaceae  species,  and  the  soils  are  highly  acidic.  There  are  4.6  ac  of  deciduous  scrub/shrub 
wetlands  representing  less  than  1  percent  of  the  total  acreage  available  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
Herbaceous  wetlands  are  characterized  as  being  dominated  by  herbaceous  species  associated 
with  lake  edges,  open  flood  plains,  and  abandoned  wetlands  agricultural  fields.  Species  that  may 
dominate  this  cover  type  include  rice  cutgrass  {Leersia  oryzoides ),  reed  canarygrass  {Phalaris 
arundinacea ),  yellow  cowlilly  {Nuphar  lutea),  halberdleaf  tearthumb  {Persicaria  arifolium), 
arrowleaf  tearthumb  {P.  sagittat),  common  cattail  {Typha  latifolia ),  and  Phragmites  (NJDEP  2010- 
TN2887).  Herbaceous  wetlands  account  for  5.8  ac,  or  less  than  1  percent,  of  the  total  acreage  at 
the  PSEG  Site.  Phragmites-domlnaied  interior  wetlands  are  dominated  by  the  common  reed 
Phragmites  australis  and  account  for  1 18.7  ac  or  14.5  percent  of  the  site’s  acreage. 

The  most  common  species  observed  by  PSEG  during  2009  to  2010  walking  surveys  of  onsite 
wetland  habitats  included  groundsel  tree/sea  myrtle  {Baccharis  halimifolia),  Japanese 
honeysuckle  {Lonicera japonica ),  common  ragweed  {Ambrosia  artemisiifolia ),  mugwort 
{Artemisia  vulgaris),  horseweed  {Conyza  canadensis),  Queen  Anne’s  lace  {Daucus  carota), 
annual  fleabane  {Erigeron  annuus),  late  boneset  {Eupatorium  serotinum),  fescue  {Festuca  sp.), 
Carolina  crane’s-bill  {Geranium  carolinianum),  foxtail  barley  {Hordeum jubatum),  white  sweet 
clover  {Melilotus  albus),  yellow  sweet  clover  {Melilotus  officinalis),  blue  scorpion  grass  {Myosotis 
stricta),  Texas  toadflax  {Nuttallanthus  texenus),  common  reed,  American  plantain  ( Plantago 
rugelii),  plantain  {Plantago  virginica),  Canada  bluegrass  {Poa  compressa),  mile-a-minute  vine 
{Persicaria  perfoliatam),  red  sorrel  {Rumex  acetosella),  curly  dock  {Rumex  crispus),  green 
foxtail  {Setaria  viridis),  goldenrod  {Solidago  sp.),  and  purpletop  {Tridens  flavus)  (PSEG  2015-

Affected  Environment 


Forested  Land — Old  field  (<25  percent  brush  covered),  Phragmites-6 o m i nated  old  field,  and 
deciduous  brush/shrubland  identified  by  NJDEP  as  occurring  on  the  PSEG  Site  are  categorized 
under  forested  land,  brushland/shrubland.  Vegetation  cover  could  include  early  successional 
species  to  climax  species  and  are  between  0  and  20  ft  in  height.  Old  field  is  also  covered  in  this 
category  and  can  contain  shrubs  and  grasses  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  Forested  land  covers 
more  than  1 07.3  ac  of  the  site  or  1 3  percent  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Old  field  (<25  percent  brushed  covered)  is  predominantly  covered  by  grasses,  herbaceous 
species,  tree  seedlings,  and/or  saplings.  Phragmites-6 o m i nated  old  field  contains  open  fields 
predominantly  covered  by  the  common  reed.  Natural  forested  areas  covered  predominantly 
with  deciduous  species  less  than  20  ft  in  height  are  classified  under  deciduous  brush/shrubland. 
This  category  can  also  include  agricultural  lands  that  have  been  overgrown  with  brush 
(NJDEP  2010-TN2887). 

Walking  surveys  conducted  by  PSEG  in  2009  to  2010  on  brushland/scrubland  areas  indicated 
that  the  most  common  vegetation  species  were  groundsel  tree/sea  myrtle,  autumn  olive 
( Elaeagnus  umbellata),  multiflora  rose  ( Rosa  multiflora ),  Japanese  honeysuckle,  poison  ivy 
( Toxicodendron  radicans ),  annual  ragweed  ( Ambrosia  artemisiifolia ),  broomsedge  ( Andropogon 
virginicus ),  thyme-leaf  sandwort  ( Arenaria  serpyllifolia),  mugwort,  Queen  Anne’s  lace,  common 
spike  rush  {Eleocharis  palustris),  late  boneset  ( Eupatorium ),  fescue,  Chinese  lespedeza 
( Lespedeza  cuneata),  yellow  sweet  clover  ( Melilotus  officinalis),  blue  scorpion  grass,  common 
reed,  plantain,  Canada  bluegrass,  green  foxtail  grass,  Canada  goldenrod  ( Solidago  altissima), 
goldenrod,  and  purpletop  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Water — The  NJDEP  LULC  category  of  water  includes  all  areas  within  the  landmass  of  New 
Jersey  periodically  covered  by  water.  This  includes  the  artificial  lakes  and  tidal  rivers,  inland 
bays,  and  other  tidal  waters  found  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Artificial  lakes  include  water  bodies  that 
are  1  ac  and  larger  and  desilt  basins.  Water  control  structures  would  be  present  on  these  sites. 
Tidal  rivers,  inland  bays,  and  other  tidal  waters  include  tidal  portions  of  watercourses,  enclosed 
tidal  bays,  and  other  tidal  water  bodies  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  Land  cover  categorized  as 
water  accounts  for  approximately  46  ac  or  5.6  percent  of  the  site  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Barren  Land — Barren  lands  are  in  a  nonurban  setting  and  are  characterized  by  thin  soil,  sand, 
or  rocks.  These  land  cover  types  often  are  lacking  vegetative  cover,  or  the  vegetation  is  sparse 
(NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  The  NJDEP  LULC  data  indicates  that  two  subcategories  of  barren 
land — altered  lands  and  disturbed  wetlands — are  present  on  the  site.  Altered  lands  are 
nonurban  areas  that  have  been  changed  by  human  activities.  Disturbed  wetlands  are  former 
natural  wetlands  that  have  been  altered  by  clearing,  grading,  leveling,  filling,  and/or  excavating. 
The  soils  are  hydric,  but  the  land  lacks  vegetation  or  wetland  species.  Barren  lands  represent 
19.1  ac  of  the  site’s  total  acreage  or  2  percent  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Managed  Wetland — Managed  wetlands  are  characterized  by  hydric  soils  but  do  not  support 
typical  wetland  vegetation.  Some  examples  are  stormwater  swales,  golf  fairways  and 
recreational  fields,  and  open  lawn  areas  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  Managed  wetlands  account 
for  3.8  ac,  or  less  than  1  percent,  of  the  site  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).

Vicinity 

Portions  of  the  State  of  Delaware  and  the  Delaware  River  lie  within  the  6-mi  vicinity  in  addition 
to  portions  of  the  State  of  New  Jersey.  The  NJDEP  LULC  database  does  not  provide 
vegetation  cover  for  areas  outside  of  New  Jersey.  As  a  result,  the  USGS  LULC  database  was 
used  to  determine  the  vegetation  communities  for  areas  within  the  6-mi  vicinity.  Table  2-2 
quantifies  the  USGS  LULC  cover  types  found  on  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  USGS 
database  is  composed  of  nine  LULC  categories  (Anderson  et  al.  1976-TN2888).  Six  of  these 
categories  are  applicable  to  the  PSEG  vicinity:  urban  or  built-up  land  (developed  land), 
agricultural  land,  forest  land,  water,  wetlands,  and  barren  land.  Urban  or  built-up  land  accounts 
for  939  ac  or  1 .2  percent  of  the  available  land  use  in  the  vicinity.  Agricultural  land  includes 
cultivated  crops  and  pasture.  Approximately  17,097  ac,  or  23.2  percent,  of  the  vicinity’s 
available  vegetation  cover  is  agricultural.  Forested  land  in  the  vicinity  includes  deciduous, 
evergreen,  and  mixed  forests  and  accounts  for  approximately  2,653  ac  or  3.6  percent  of  the 
vicinity’s  available  vegetation  cover.  As  a  result  of  the  PSEG  Site’s  proximity  to  the  Delaware 
River  and  Bay,  water  is  the  largest  available  LULC  in  the  vicinity,  accounting  for  approximately 
26,837  ac  or  34.7  percent  of  the  vicinity.  There  are  about  16,555  ac  of  emergent  herbaceous 
wetlands  and  8,979  ac  of  woody  wetlands.  Together,  the  wetlands  LULC  accounts  for  34.6 
percent,  the  second  largest  vegetation  cover  type  in  the  vicinity.  Barren  land  makes  up  nearly 
651  ac  or  less  than  1  percent  of  the  LULC  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  existing  access  road  and  the  proposed  causeway  are  included  as  part  of  the  vicinity.  The 
existing  access  road  extends  3.6  mi  east-northeast  from  the  PSEG  Site  to  Alloway  Creek  Neck 
Road.  The  ROW  is  350  ft  wide  except  where  it  traverses  State-owned  lands,  where  it  is  450  ft 
wide  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG  holds  the  deed  of  easement  to  the  privately  owned  access 
road  and  is  responsible  for  its  maintenance  and  operation  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  1982- 
TN2889).  Vegetation  cover  types  (Table  2-3)  in  the  existing  access  road  include  134  ac  of 
agricultural  land,  146  ac  of  wetlands,  50  ac  of  urban  or  built-up  land,  39  ac  of  barren  land,  6  ac 
of  forest  land,  and  4  ac  of  water.  The  total  area  covered  by  the  existing  access  road  ROW  is 
379  ac  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Dominant  species  noted  along  the  access  road  include  common 
reed  and  saltmarsh  cordgrass  (PSEG  1982-TN2889).  PSEG  conducted  a  qualitative  field 
survey  of  the  road  side  vegetation  along  the  existing  access  road  in  the  2009  growing  season. 
The  survey  listed  83  species  of  plants  including  21  tree/sapling  species,  9  shrubs,  5  vines,  and 
48  herb  species.  No  endangered  or  threatened  plant  species  were  observed  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

Wildlife 

Historical  data  in  support  of  HCGS  and  SGS  licensing  activities  were  used  as  the  starting  point 
for  baselining  wildlife  data  for  the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity.  Additional  information  from  biological 
monitoring  reports  from  HCGS  and  SGS  operations,  resource  agencies,  conservation 
organizations,  and  field  surveys  was  used  to  supplement  historical  data.  Field  surveys  were 
completed  from  2009  to  2010  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).

Mammals 


PSEG  initiated  a  records  review  that  included  information  about  species  potentially  occurring  in 
the  region  from  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  wildlife  agencies.  The  records  review  was  supported 
by  qualitative  mammal  surveys  conducted  in  2009  and  2010.  Twenty-nine  mammal  species 
were  observed  during  the  field  surveys.  The  most  common  species  observed  were  white-tailed 
deer  ( Odocoileus  virginianus),  raccoon  ( Procyon  lotor),  eastern  cottontail  ( Sylvilagus  floridanus), 
opossum  ( Didelphis  virginiana),  and  eastern  gray  squirrel  ( Sciurus  carolinensis).  Other 
mammal  species  observed  on  the  site  or  in  the  vicinity  included  groundhog  ( Marmota  monax), 
muskrat  ( Ondatra  zibethicus ),  Norway  rat  ( Rattus  norveigecus),  coyote  (Cam's  latrans ),  river 
otter  ( Lontra  canadensis),  striped  skunk  (Mephitis  mephitis),  black  bear  (Ursus  americanus), 
and  red  fox  (Vulpes  vulpes).  Mammal  species  that  were  not  observed  during  the  survey  but  that 
have  been  observed  in  the  past  or  are  known  to  occur  on  the  site  or  vicinity  include  short-tailed 
shrew  (Blarina  brevicauda),  masked  shrew  (Sorex  cinereus),  big  brown  bat  (Eptesicus  fuscus), 
red  bat  (Lasiurus  borealis),  little  brown  myotis  (Myotis  lucifugus),  keen’s  myotis  (M.  keenii), 
small-footed  myotis  (Myotis  leibii),  tri-colored  bat  (Perimyotis  subflavus),  meadow  vole  (Microtus 
pennsylvanicus),  house  mouse  (Mus  musculus),  marsh  rice  rat  (Oryzomys palaustris),  white¬ 
footed  mouse  (Peromyscus  leucopus),  southern  bog  lemming  (Synaptomys  cooperi),  meadow 
jumping  mouse  (Zapus  hudsonius),  long-tailed  weasel  (Mustela  frenata),  and  gray  fox  (Urocyon 
cinereoargenteus)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Muskrat  was  the  most  observed  mammal  species  along  the  access  road  during  previous 
surveys.  In  addition,  house  mouse,  meadow  vole,  masked  shrew.  Norway  rat,  and  marsh  rice 
rat  were  the  most  commonly  captured  mammal  species  along  the  access  road  (PSEG  1982- 
TN2889).  No  Federally  or  State-listed  endangered  or  threatened  mammal  species  were 
observed  during  the  2009  qualitative  surveys  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Birds 


An  initial  records  review  was  conducted  to  identify  bird  species  recorded  in  the  vicinity  of  the 
PSEG  Site.  During  2009  to  2010  field  surveys,  15,1 12  birds  of  125  species  were  observed 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Previous  surveys  of  the  existing  access  road  have  identified  over 
180  avian  species  (PSEG  1982-TN2889).  Common  passerine  species  observed  during  field 
surveys  included  red-winged  blackbird  (Agelaius  phoeniceus),  common  grackle  ( Quiscalus 
guiscula),  brown-headed  cowbird  (Molothrus  ater),  mourning  dove  (Zenaida  macroura),  northern 
cardinal  (Cardinalis  cardinalis ),  American  crow  (Corvus  brachyrhynchos),  American  robin 
(Turdus  migratorius),  gray  catbird  (Dumetella  carolinensis),  common  yellowthroat  (Geothlypis 
trichas),  tree  swallow  (Tachycineta  bicolor),  barn  swallow  (Hirundo  rustica),  song  sparrow 
(Melospiza  melodia),  and  European  starling  (Sturnus  vulgaris).  Common  waterfowl  species 
recorded  included  Canada  goose  (Branta  canadensis),  snow  goose  (Chen  caerulescens), 
mallard  (Anas  platyrhynchos),  American  black  duck  (Anas  rubripes),  and  greater  scaup  (Aythya 
marila).  Shorebird  species  prevalent  during  the  survey  included  least  sandpiper  (Calidris 
minutilla)  and  lesser  yellowlegs  (Tringa  flavipes).  Gulls  commonly  observed  during  the  survey 
included  ring-billed  gull  (Larus  delawarensis)  and  greater  black-backed  gull  (Larus  marinus) 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Turkey  vulture  (Cathartes  aura)  was  another  bird  species  commonly 
observed  during  the  survey.

Affected  Environment 


Most  of  the  habitat  on  the  PSEG  Site  consists  of  areas  dominated  by  a  common  reed 
monoculture.  Phragmites  monocultures  have  limited  structure  and  provide  poor  quality 
foraging,  nesting,  and  cover  habitat  for  most  birds.  Therefore,  any  use  of  this  habitat  by  most 
birds  would  probably  be  of  a  transitory  nature.  Marsh  wrens  ( Cistothorus  palustris)  and  red¬ 
winged  blackbirds  are  two  species  that  could  potentially  use  the  fringes  of  the  Phragmites  areas 
for  breeding/nesting.  The  northern  harrier  ( Circus  cyaneus),  osprey  ( Pandion  haliaetus ),  and 
bald  eagle  ( Haliaeetus  leucocephalus)  are  three  coastal  habitat  raptor  species  observed  on  the 
site.  The  adjacent  Delaware  River  bordering  the  PSEG  Site  to  the  west  and  south  provides 
moderate  to  good  foraging  habitat  for  these  species.  Ospreys  nest  on  transmission  towers 
within  the  site  vicinity  along  the  existing  PSEG  access  road  and  proposed  causeway  corridor. 
Old  field  habitat  in  the  southeastern  portion  of  the  site  contains  eastern  red  cedar  and  autumn 
olive  and  provides  some  foraging  and  nesting  habitat  for  songbirds.  Typical  songbirds  observed 
in  this  area  included  northern  cardinal,  song  sparrow,  gray  catbird,  common  yellowthroat,  and 
yellow  warbler  ( Dendroica  petechia)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  site  and  vicinity  also  provide  foraging  habitat  for  wading  birds  and  shorebirds.  Species 
observed  in  the  area  included  great  blue  heron  ( Ardea  herodias),  green  heron  ( Butorides 
virescens),  little  blue  heron  ( Egretta  caerulea ),  great  egret  ( Ardea  alba),  snowy  egret  ( Egretta 
thula),  cattle  egret  ( Bubulcus  ibis),  black-crowned  night-heron  (Nycticorax  nycticorax),  glossy 
ibis  ( Plegadis  falcinellus),  black-necked  stilt  ( Himantopus  mexicanus),  greater  yellowlegs 
( Tringa  melanoleuca),  and  lesser  yellowlegs  ( Tringa  flavipes).  There  are  no  known  colonial 
waterbird  rookeries  on  the  PSEG  Site  or  within  the  6-mi  vicinity.  The  closest  is  about  9  mi  north 
of  the  site  on  the  Delaware  River  at  Pea  Patch  Island,  Fort  Delaware  State  Park.  The  rookery, 
located  at  the  northern  undeveloped  end  of  the  island,  is  the  largest  heron  and  egret  rookery  on 
the  east  coast  of  the  United  States.  Pea  Patch  Island  supports  5,000  to  12,000  breeding  pairs 
of  wading  birds.  The  nine  species  of  colonial  waterbirds  that  nest  at  this  rookery  are  the  great 
blue  heron,  great  egret,  little  blue  heron,  snowy  egret,  cattle  egret,  yellow-crowned  night-heron 
( Nyctanassa  violacea),  black-crowned  night-heron,  glossy  ibis,  and  tricolored  heron  ( Egretta 
tricolor)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  A  special  area  management  plan  was  developed  for  the  Pea 
Patch  Island  Heronry  Region  that  emphasizes  the  need  for  protection,  restoration, 
enhancement,  and  creation  of  suitable  foraging  and  nesting  habitat  for  wading  birds  and  other 
birds  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  (DCMP  and  NOAA  1998-TN4233). 

New  Jersey  is  located  within  the  Atlantic  migratory  flyway  (Birdnature.com  2013-TN2890).  Birds 
observed  in  the  PSEG  Site  vicinity  that  use  this  flyway  include  Canada  goose,  snow  goose, 
mallard,  American  black  duck,  greater  scaup,  least  sandpiper,  semipalmated  sandpiper  ( Calidris 
pusilla),  lesser  yellowlegs,  and  greater  yellowlegs  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Reptiles 

Qualitative  surveys  were  conducted  on  the  PSEG  Site  in  the  spring,  summer,  and  fall  of  2009  to 
record  reptile  species  found  in  the  various  habitats  on  the  site.  During  the  surveys,  three  turtle 
species  and  three  snake  species  were  recorded.  A  records  review  was  conducted  before  the 
initiation  of  field  surveys  to  determine  reptile  species  that  potentially  could  occur  in  the  region. 
This  included  gathering  information  from  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  WMAs  regarding  known 
ranges  of  reptile  species  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site,  as  well  as  details  on  any  listed  species  that

may  occur  in  the  area.  The  records  searches  were  supplemented  with  the  field  studies 
conducted  in  2009  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Reptiles  were  surveyed  through  general  site  reconnaissance  and  observation,  and  transect 
surveys  along  the  same  eight  study  transects  used  to  conduct  the  bird  and  mammal  surveys. 
Representative  portions  of  the  proposed  causeway  and  areas  adjacent  to  the  existing  access 
road  were  also  surveyed  qualitatively.  Historical  data  from  an  intensive  study  conducted  on 
Artificial  Island  and  vicinity  (1972  to  1978)  were  also  used  to  aid  in  the  characterization  of  reptile 
populations  and  the  identification  of  important  species  within  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

The  most  common  reptile  species  recorded  on  the  PSEG  Site  during  the  2009  field  surveys  was 
the  eastern  painted  turtle  ( Chrysemys  picta  picta).  A  total  of  1 1  additional  species  of  turtles,  1 1 
additional  species  of  snakes,  and  one  species  of  lizard  were  recorded  during  the  Artificial  Island 
study  from  1972  to  1978.  Federally  and/or  New  Jersey  State-listed  turtles  recorded  during  the 
Artificial  Island  study  included  the  bog  turtle  ( Glyptemys  muhlenbergii).  Sea  turtles  are 
discussed  in  Section  2.4.2.  The  bog  turtle  was  not  recorded  at  the  PSEG  Site  during  the  2009 
studies  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Amphibians 

Qualitative  surveys  were  conducted  on  the  PSEG  Site  in  the  spring,  summer,  and  fall  of  2009 
to  record  amphibian  species  found  in  the  various  habitats  on  the  site.  During  the  surveys,  five 
species  of  frogs  and  toads  were  recorded.  A  records  review  was  conducted  before  the 
initiation  of  field  surveys  to  determine  amphibian  species  that  potentially  could  occur  in  the 
region.  This  included  gathering  information  from  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  WMAs  regarding 
known  ranges  of  amphibian  species  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site,  as  well  as  details  on  any  listed 
species  that  may  occur  in  the  area.  These  records  searches  were  supplemented  with  the 
field  studies  conducted  in  2009  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Amphibians  were  surveyed  through  general  site  reconnaissance  and  observation,  spring 
night-time  anuran  (frog  and  toad)  call  surveys,  and  transect  surveys  along  the  same  eight  study 
transects  used  to  conduct  the  bird,  mammal,  and  reptile  surveys.  Representative  portions  of  the 
proposed  causeway  and  areas  adjacent  to  the  existing  access  road  were  also  surveyed 
qualitatively.  Historical  data  from  an  intensive  study  conducted  on  Artificial  Island  and  vicinity 
(1972  to  1978)  also  were  used  to  aid  in  the  characterization  of  amphibian  populations  and  the 
identification  of  important  species  within  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  most  common  amphibian  species  recorded  on  the  site  during  field  surveys  conducted  in 
2009  included  the  northern  spring  peeper  ( Pseudacris  crucifer)  and  southern  leopard  frog 
(. Lithobates  sphenocephalus).  In  July  2009,  green  tree  frogs  (Hyla  cinerea )  were  recorded  in 
ponds  within  the  desilt  basins  in  the  northwestern  portion  of  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  Green  tree  frogs  were  also  recorded  during  a  survey  conducted  in  June  to  July  2012 
at  three  onsite  locations  and  numerous  locations  in  the  site  vicinity  (AMEC  2012-TN3187).  The 
green  tree  frog  is  a  resident  species  in  Delaware;  however,  this  is  the  first  record  for  the  species 
in  New  Jersey.  Seven  additional  species  of  frogs  and  toads  and  nine  species  of  salamanders 
were  recorded  during  the  Artificial  Island  study  conducted  between  1972  and  1978.  This

included  the  New  Jersey  State-listed  eastern  tiger  salamander  ( Ambystoma  tigrinum).  The  tiger 
salamander  was  not  recorded  at  the  PSEG  Site  during  the  2009  studies  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Nuisance  Species 

Nuisance  species  are  disease  vectors  or  pests.  These  include  a  large  number  of  terrestrial 
wildlife  species  that  can  be  pests  in  urban,  suburban,  or  even  rural  settings.  Wildlife  species  in 
this  category  either  recently  or  previously  recorded  on  the  PSEG  Site  or  in  the  vicinity  include 
coyote,  Norway  rat,  and  European  starling.  Although  coyote  can  be  a  beneficial  predator  in 
natural  settings,  it  can  be  a  nuisance  in  urban  and  suburban  settings,  resulting  in  more 
confrontations  with  people  and  predation  on  pets  (i.e.,  small  dogs  and  cats).  The  Norway  rat 
and  European  starling  are  non-native  species  common  to  urban  and  surburban  areas.  Norway 
rats  can  damage  property  and  spread  diseases,  and  European  starlings  out-compete  native  bird 
species  for  nesting  habitat  and  become  a  general  nuisance  where  they  congregate  in  large 
roosting  flocks. 

Additional  nuisance  species  on  the  PSEG  Site  may  include  insects  such  as  ticks,  mosquitoes, 
and  wasps.  On  the  site,  the  one  known  disease  vector  is  the  blacklegged  or  deer  tick  ( Ixodes 
scapularis),  which  transmits  the  bacterial  pathogen  ( Borrelia  burgdorferi)  from  small  rodents, 
squirrels,  and  deer  to  humans  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Invasive  pest  plant  species  found  on  the  PSEG  Site  include  the  invasive  strain  of  common  reed, 
Lespedeza  cuneata,  and  others.  Common  reed  causes  the  most  concern  because  it 
out-competes  native  wetland  species.  Not  native  to  New  Jersey,  the  common  reed  first 
appeared  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  during  the  1950s,  following  several  years  of  repeated 
disturbance  by  hurricanes.  It  is  a  wetland  species  that  typically  occurs  in  marshes  and  along 
rivers,  lakes,  and  ponds.  The  plant  can  tolerate  moderate  salinity  and  thrives  in  disturbed 
wetland  areas.  Once  established  in  an  area  from  seed,  this  reed  reproduces  mainly  through 
vegetative  growth  by  rhizomes  and  stolons,  forming  dense  monoculture  communities  (PSEG 
2015-TN4280). 

Travel  Corridors 

Travel  corridors  provide  numerous  essential  functions  needed  for  the  survival  of  wildlife  species. 
Corridors  can  be  viewed  at  three  scales:  (1 )  local,  (2)  regional,  and  (3)  migratory.  In  diverse 
landscapes,  wildlife  travel  through  areas  of  favorable  habitat  that  connect  to  other  habitats  that 
meet  their  basic  needs  of  food  and  shelter.  On  a  local  level,  typical  travel  corridors  may  include 
brushy  or  forested  hedgerows,  fencerows,  stream  riparian  zones,  or  ridgetops.  The  PSEG  Site 
is  elevated  above  surrounding  coastal  habitats  (marshland  and  riverine),  making  it  more  of  a 
habitat  island  than  a  wildlife  travel  corridor.  Habitats  on  the  PSEG  Site  are  dominated  by  early 
successional  plant  communities  that  do  not  act  as  major  wildlife  travel  corridors.  Alloway  Creek 
and  associated  coastal  wetlands  are  part  of  an  extensive  coastal  wetland  complex  that  follows 
the  New  Jersey  coastline.  This  large  area  of  contiguous  habitat  may  be  considered  part  of  a 
larger  corridor  that  could  be  used  by  wildlife  for  dispersal  and  seasonal  movements  within  the 
project  vicinity  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Certain  species  of  wildlife  may  be  limited  to  movement 
in  human-made  travel  corridors,  which  include  existing  transmission  lines  and  an  existing 
access  road  on  the  PSEG  Site.

Affected  Environment 


The  Delaware  River,  as  part  of  the  Atlantic  Flyway,  acts  as  the  major  migratory  travel  corridor  in 
the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  This  is  one  of  the  four  major  flyways  in  North  America.  The  New 
Jersey  coastline  is  a  major  stopover  and  wintering  area  for  a  number  of  waterfowl  and  shorebird 
species.  New  Jersey’s  latitude  places  it  about  midway  between  the  equator  and  northern 
forests  and  Arctic  areas.  Its  central  location  means  it  serves  many  migratory  bird  populations. 

It  is  a  major  stopover  point  for  northern  bird  populations  during  migration  southward  in  the  fall 
and  northward  in  the  spring  and  acts  as  a  wintering  endpoint  for  a  number  of  species 
(NJ  Audubon  2014-TN2896).  The  Delaware  River  also  is  used  as  a  travel  corridor  by  coastal 
raptors  (e.g.,  bald  eagles,  northern  harriers,  and  ospreys)  for  foraging  and  while  searching  for 
nest  sites  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Human-Induced  Ecological  Effects  on  the  Site  and  Vicinity 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  on  Artificial  Island,  which  was  created  with  dredge  spoils  from  the 
Delaware  River.  The  southwestern  portion  of  the  island  is  dominated  by  the  roads,  parking,  and 
structures  associated  with  HCGS  and  SGS.  Activities  related  to  HCGS  and  SGS  present  the 
most  obvious  human-induced  disturbances  on  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  existing  nuclear  generation  stations  have  been  operating  for  37  years  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  The  existing  SGS  Unit  1  began  production  in  1976,  and  by  1986,  SGS  Unit  2  and 
HCGS  Unit  1  were  operating.  The  tallest  structure  is  the  HCGS  cooling  tower,  which  is  512  ft 
above  the  surrounding  landscape.  This  structure  has  a  localized  impact  on  migrating  birds  in 
the  area.  PSEG  monitored  bird  collisions  with  the  HCGS  cooling  towers  over  a  3-year  period 
ending  in  1986.  During  that  time  frame,  30  bird  mortalities  were  noted  and  attributed  to  the 
cooling  tower  (PSEG  1987-TN2893). 

Sources  of  noise  on  the  PSEG  Site  include  the  HCGS  cooling  tower;  vehicle  traffic; 
overhead  transmission  lines;  transformers;  heating,  ventilation,  and  air-conditioning  units;  and 
aircraft.  The  highest  noise  levels,  51.6  dBA,  are  attributed  to  the  operation  of  the  cooling 
tower  and  road  traffic  on  the  site.  While  noise  can  be  a  deterrent  to  wildlife  species,  many 
species  on  the  PSEG  Site  have  adapted.  This  adaptation  is  evident  by  the  numerous  bird 
species  present  near  the  cooling  tower  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

2.4. 1.2  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Resources— Existing  Transmission  Lines 

Four  existing  550-kV  transmission  lines  within  three  existing  transmission  corridors  convey 
power  from  SGS  and  HCGS.  The  existing  102  mi  of  transmission  corridors  cross  Salem, 
Gloucester,  and  Camden  Counties  in  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle  County  in  Delaware  (PSEG 
2015-TN4280).  The  existing  transmission  lines  include  Hope  Creek-New  Freedom,  Salem- 
New  Freedom,  Hope  Creek-Red  Lion,  and  Salem-New  Freedom  South.  The  Hope  Creek-New 
Freedom  line  is  operated  by  Public  Service  Electric  and  Gas  Company  (PSE&G)  for  the  extent 
of  its  43  mi  length  to  the  New  Freedom  substation  in  Williamstown,  New  Jersey.  It  lies  within  a 
350-ft-wide  ROW  and  is  segmented  by  the  Orchard  substation.  The  Salem-New  Freedom  line 
is  operate  by  PSE&G  and  runs  50  mi  northeast  to  the  New  Freedom  substation.  It  shares  the 
same  ROW  as  the  Hope  Creek-New  Freedom  line.  The  Hope  Creek-Red  Lion  transmission 
line  extends  north  for  13  mi,  where  it  then  crosses  west  over  the  Delaware  River  for  4  mi  to  the 
Red  Lion  substation  in  Delaware.  The  line  is  operated  by  PSE&G  in  New  Jersey  and  Pepco

Affected  Environment 


Holdings  Inc.  (PHI)  in  Delaware.  Most  of  the  ROW  is  200  ft  wide,  while  one-third  is  350  ft  wide. 
The  Salem-New  Freedom  South  transmission  line  is  operated  by  PSE&G  and  extends  to  the 
northeast  for  42  mi,  where  it  connects  with  the  New  Freedom  substation  in  Williamstown,  New 
Jersey.  The  ROW  is  about  350  ft  wide  but  varies  along  its  length  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Existing  Cover  Types  and  Vegetation 

Data  on  the  vegetation  cover  types  for  the  existing  transmission  ROWs  are  based  on  500-ft 
corridors  and  USGS  LULC  data.  The  total  area  covered  by  existing  transmission  lines  is 
6,920  ac,  including  2,682  ac  of  agricultural  land,  2,100  ac  of  forest  land,  244  ac  of  urban/built-up 
land,  1 ,564  ac  of  wetlands,  206  ac  of  water,  and  124  ac  of  barren  land.  Forest  land  includes 
1 ,843  ac  of  deciduous  forest  and  233  ac  of  evergreen  forest.  Wetlands  include  1 ,029  ac  of 
woody  wetlands  and  535  ac  of  emergent  herbaceous.  Transmission  line  ROWs  supporting  the 
PSEG  Site  are  contained  within  the  50-mi  region.  The  50-mi  region  consists  of  the  Middle 
Atlantic  Coastal  Plain,  Northern  Piedmont,  and  Atlantic  Coastal  Pine  Barrens.  Native  vegetation 
in  the  Middle  Atlantic  Coastal  Plain  consists  of  swampy,  marshy,  and  frequently  flooded  areas. 
Northern  Piedmont  consists  of  irregular  plains  and  low  hills.  Atlantic  Coastal  Pine  Barrens  are 
characterized  as  low,  undulating  parts  of  the  Atlantic  Coastal  Plain  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Wildlife 

Recent  surveys  for  wildlife  within  transmission  line  corridors  in  the  region  were  not  conducted. 
However,  wildlife  species  inhabiting  transmission  line  corridors  would  consist  of  those  found 
commonly  in  the  region.  This  includes  approximately  450  species  that  naturally  occur  in  New 
Jersey  (NJDEP  2012-TN3318).  PSEG  included  portions  of  the  existing  transmission  line 
corridors  as  part  of  their  2009  to  2010  surveys  of  the  vicinity.  Wildlife  species  along  the  existing 
transmission  line  ROWs  within  the  site  and  6-mi  vicinity  would  be  similar  to  those  species 
described  in  Section  2. 4. 1.1  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Human-Induced  Ecological  Effects  on  the  Existing  Transmission  Lines 

Transmission  line  ROWs  maintenance,  including  vegetation  removal  by  mechanical  means  and 
herbicides,  imposes  a  stress  on  terrestrial  resources  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Transmission  line 
ROWs  fragment  forested  habitats  and  act  as  a  barrier  to  wildlife  movements.  Additionally, 
transmission  line  ROWs  may  potentially  cause  avian  mortality  (NRC  2013-TN2654). 

2.4. 7. 3  Important  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Species  and  Habitats— Site  and  Vicinity 

This  section  discusses  important  species  and  habitats,  as  described  by  the  NRC  in  NUREG- 
1 555  (NRC  2000-TN614),  which  may  occur  on  and  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Important 
species  defined  under  NUREG-1555  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  commercially  and 
recreationally  valuable  species;  Federally  and  State-listed,  proposed,  and  candidate  threatened 
and  endangered  terrestrial  species;  species  essential  to  the  maintenance  and  survival  of  rare  or 
commercially  or  recreationally  valuable  species;  species  critical  to  structure  or  function  of  local 
terrestrial  ecosystems;  and  species  that  serve  as  biological  indicators  (NRC  2000-TN614). 
Several  species  in  the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity  are  identified  as  being  commercially  and 
recreationally  valuable  species  as  well  as  Federally  and  State-listed  threatened  or  endangered 
species.

“Important  habitat"  is  defined  by  the  NRC  in  NUREG-1555  as  wildlife  sanctuaries,  refuges  or 
preserves,  wetlands,  floodplains,  and  areas  identified  as  critical  habitat  by  the  U.S.  Fish  and 
Wildlife  Service  (FWS)  (NRC  2000-TN614). 

The  NJDEP,  Delaware  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environmental  Control  (DNREC), 
and  FWS  were  consulted  for  information  regarding  sensitive  species  and  habitats  in  the  vicinity 
of  the  PSEG  Site.  This  included  letters  of  correspondence  and  phone  conversations  as  well  as 
personal  meetings  with  NJDEP  and  DNREC  to  obtain  agency  input  on  threatened  and 
endangered  species,  sensitive  habitats,  commercial  and  recreational  species,  and  other 
characteristics  for  the  site  and  vicinity.  A  response  has  not  yet  been  received  from  FWS 
regarding  this  project.  However,  FWS  did  correspond  with  PSEG  in  response  to  a  request  for 
information  on  the  presence  of  threatened  and  endangered  species  related  to  the  HCGS  and 
SGS  license  renewal  applications.  Information  from  these  consultations,  as  well  as  existing 
Federal  and  State  lists  available  on  the  internet,  was  used  as  the  basis  for  identifying  important 
species  and  habitats  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Table  2-8  provides  a  list  of  threatened  and  endangered  species  identified  through 
correspondence  with  resource  agencies  as  potentially  occurring  in  the  region  surrounding  the 
PSEG  Site;  the  list  includes  updates  provided  in  the  revised  February  2012  NJDEP  threatened 
and  endangered  species  lists  (NJDEP  2012-TN2186).  Each  listed  bird  species  potentially 
occurring  in  the  study  area  is  listed  by  New  Jersey  and/or  Delaware,  while  none  are  Federally 
listed  species.  Each  of  these  species  either  has  been  observed  historically  in  the  vicinity  of  the 
PSEG  Site  or  has  been  observed  recently  as  part  of  the  2009  to  2010  data  collection  activities. 
Most  of  these  species  are  widely  foraging  (e.g.,  bald  eagle  and  red-shouldered  hawk)  or  species 
associated  with  upland  habitats  (e.g.,  Cooper’s  hawk  and  red-headed  woodpecker)  that  are 
unlikely  to  nest  in  the  immediate  project  area.  By  comparison,  ospreys  are  known  to  nest  on 
transmission  towers  along  both  access  corridors.  Northern  harrier  is  a  ground  nesting  and 
widely  foraging  species  that  may  also  nest  in  the  study  area.  Those  species  associated  with 
aquatic  habitats  include  pied-billed  grebe,  cattle  egret,  and  black-crowned  night-heron.  The 
Federally  threatened  bog  turtle  was  recorded  historically  for  Artificial  Island  during  a  study 
conducted  between  1972  and  1978  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).

Commercially  and  Recreationally  Valuable  Species 

Mammals.  Important  commercial  and  recreational  mammal  species  potentially  occurring  on  the 
PSEG  Site  and  in  the  vicinity  include  white-tailed  deer,  river  otter,  and  muskrat.  White-tailed 
deer  are  considered  important  because  they  are  recreationally  hunted  in  the  area  of  the  PSEG 
Site.  The  river  otter  and  muskrat  are  considered  important  because  they  are  commercially 
trapped  in  the  area  of  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

White-tailed  deer  were  observed  in  the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity  in  Phragmites-6om\nate6  wetland 
habitat  and  more  frequently  in  the  old  field  habitat  during  the  2009  to  2010  field  surveys.  The 
only  onsite  area  that  provides  forage  for  white-tailed  deer  is  the  old  field  habitat.  PSEG  allows 
for  limited  deer  hunting  on  the  PSEG  Site  under  controlled  conditions  to  cull  deer  populations 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  river  otter  and  muskrats  are  considered  to  be  commercially  important  because  they  are 
valued  as  furbearers.  Their  habitats  include  both  freshwater  and  coastal  areas  such  as  lakes, 
rivers,  marshes,  swamps,  and  estuaries.  River  otters  were  observed  at  the  PSEG  Site  and 
vicinity  in  the  spring  and  summer  during  the  2009  to  2010  field  survey  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

In  New  Jersey,  muskrats  occupy  a  number  of  estuarine  habitats,  including  impounded  and 
natural  tidal  and  inland  marshes,  along  with  freshwater  ponds,  streams,  and  lakes.  Muskrats 
were  observed  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  in  the  vicinity  in  spring  and  summer  during  the  2009  to 
2010  surveys  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  This  species  was  also  recorded  during  past  work 
conducted  in  the  Alloway  Creek  watershed  (PSEG  2004-TN2897). 

Birds.  Bird  species  potentially  occurring  on  the  site  or  in  the  vicinity  that  are  considered 
important  for  recreational  or  commercial  value  include  northern  pintail  ( Anas  acuta),  green¬ 
winged  teal  {Anas  crecca),  mallard,  American  black  duck,  ring-necked  duck  ( Aythya  collaris), 
greater  scaup,  bufflehead  {Bucephala  albeola),  hooded  merganser  ( Lophodytes  cucullatus), 
common  merganser  ( Mergus  merganser),  red-breasted  merganser  ( Mergus  serrator),  American 
coot  ( Fulica  americana),  Canada  goose  ,  snow  goose,  and  wild  turkey  ( Meleagris  gallopavo) 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  All  of  these  species  are  common  to  New  Jersey  and  were  observed 
either  on  the  PSEG  Site  or  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  during  the  course  of  the  2009  to  2010  survey. 
Several  recreational  species  were  observed  in  the  existing  access  road  corridor  as  well, 
including  the  Canada  goose,  mallard,  black  duck,  and  green-winged  teal  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Federally  and  State- Listed  Species 

Table  2-8  provides  a  list  of  threatened,  endangered,  and  special  concern  species  identified 
through  correspondence  with  resource  agencies  as  potentially  occurring  in  the  region 
surrounding  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  Federally  threatened  and  endangered  species  list  was  developed  using  the  FWS  species 
list  for  the  6-mi  vicinity.  Only  two  counties  were  identified  as  within  the  vicinity:  Salem  County, 
New  Jersey  and  New  Castle  County,  Delaware.  Six  Federally  listed  terrestrial  species  are 
known  or  believed  to  occur  on  the  PSEG  Site  or  in  the  vicinity.  All  six  species  are  Federally 
listed  as  threatened.  One  species  is  a  bird,  one  is  a  mammal,  one  is  a  reptile,  and  three  are

plants.  Of  the  Federally  listed  species,  only  the  bog  turtle  has  been  recorded  as  occurring  on 
the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Biological  assessments  (BAs)  for  the  bog  turtle,  northern 
long-eared  bat  ( Myotis  septentrionalis),  and  rufa  red  knot  ( Calidris  canutus  rufa)  are  included  in 
Appendix  F  in  support  of  consultation  with  the  FWS. 

NJDEP  Division  of  Fish  and  Wildlife  maintains  the  State’s  endangered  and  threatened  wildlife 
species  lists.  New  Jersey  endangered  and  threatened  species  are  those  whose  prospects  for 
survival  in  New  Jersey  either  are  immediately  in  danger  or  may  become  endangered  because  of 
loss  of  habitat,  exploitation,  predation,  competition,  disease,  disturbance,  or  contamination. 
Other  classifications  include  species  of  special  concern.  Additionally,  New  Jersey  distinguishes 
between  breeding  and  nonbreeding  populations  for  avian  species  (NJDEP  2014-TN3286). 

The  State  of  Delaware  Natural  Heritage  and  Endangered  Species  Program  is  maintained  by  the 
DNREC  Division  of  Fish  and  Wildlife  (DNREC  2013-TN3067).  Delaware’s  Division  of  Fish  and 
Wildlife  ranks  species  based  on  their  relative  rarity  in  the  State  and  in  either  of  the  State’s  two 
physiographic  provinces  (Piedmont  or  Coastal  Plain)  (DNREC  2006-TN2899).  The  ranking 
system  is  based  on  a  system  used  by  Nature  Serve,  a  nonprofit  conservation  organization.  The 
Delaware  State  status  ranks  include  SI,  defined  as  extremely  rare  species  in  Delaware; 

S2,  very  rare;  S3,  rare  to  uncommon;  and  S4,  apparently  secure.  The  letter  “B"  refers  to 
breeding  status  and  nonbreeding  status.  In  response  to  the  applicant,  the  Division  of  Fish  and 
Wildlife  provided  a  list  of  endangered  species  and  species  of  concern  in  a  letter  dated 
April  7,  2009  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Table  2-8  provides  a  list  of  rare  species  within  the  6-mi 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  within  the  State  of  Delaware’s  boundaries  and  only  in  areas  that  have 
been  surveyed  as  of  March  31,  2009.  DNREC  Division  of  Fish  and  Wildlife  has  not  surveyed  all 
the  areas  within  Delaware  and  additional  rare  species  not  listed  may  occur  within  the  vicinity  of 
the  project  area. 

Additionally,  several  State-listed  species  were  observed  near  the  existing  access  road,  such  as 
the  cattle  egret,  black-crowned  night-heron,  and  osprey.  These  species  were  noted  during  the 
2009  qualitative  surveys,  as  well  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Bog  turtle.  The  bog  turtle  is  a  nongame  species  Federally-listed  as  threatened,  New  Jersey 
State-listed  as  endangered,  and  Delaware  State-listed  as  endangered.  Bog  turtles  inhabit  fens, 
bogs,  and  wet  meadows  characterized  by  mucky,  organic  soil  that  remains  saturated  by 
groundwater.  Plant  communities  in  bog  turtle  habitat  vary  in  species  composition  but  are  almost 
always  dominated  by  low-growing  grasses,  sedges,  rushes,  ferns,  scattered  cattails,  and  forbs. 
Shrub  and  tree  cover  is  typically  low,  and  physical  features  of  the  habitat  include  spring-derived 
rivulets,  shallow,  mucky  pools,  and  abundant  sedge  or  moss-covered  hummocks.  Bog  turtles 
spend  much  of  their  time  hiding  in  cool,  soft  muck  that  provides  cover  and  aids  in 
thermoregulation  during  warm  summer  months.  After  emerging  from  subterranean  hibernacula 
in  the  spring,  they  spend  much  of  that  season  into  early  summer  basking  on  hummocks  and 
other  areas.  Mating  occurs  primarily  in  May  and  June.  Females  lay  their  eggs  in  drier  areas  of 
the  marsh  such  as  sedge  and  moss  hummocks  or  rotted  tree  stumps.  The  diet  of  the  bog  turtle 
is  mainly  invertebrates,  particularly  slugs.  They  may  also  feed  on  carrion,  small  berries,  sedge 
seeds,  young  cattail  shoots,  and  duckweed.  Once  abundant  throughout  New  Jersey,  the  bog 
turtle  is  now  restricted  to  the  remaining  rural  portions  of  the  state,  including  Sussex,  Warren, 
Hunterdon  and  Salem  Counties.  They  require  large  contiguous  areas  of  land  for  dispersal.

Affected  Environment 


Intense  land  uses  impact  bog  turtle  habitat  through  direct  alteration  of  wetlands  and  secondary 
impacts  such  as  stormwater  inputs,  water  table  drawdown  and  nutrient  enrichment 
(NJDEP  2014-TN3287). 

The  primary  threats  to  bog  turtle  populations  in  New  Jersey  have  been  habitat  loss  due  to 
natural  succession,  habitat  fragmentation,  and  illegal  collection.  Vegetation  succession  has  a 
negative  impact  on  bog  turtles  by  eliminating  open  areas,  resulting  in  the  reduction  of  suitable 
nesting  sites  and  basking  habitat.  Important  microclimates  may  also  be  eliminated  and  a 
monoculture  created  with  the  infiltration  of  invasive  plant  species  such  as  Phragmites,  reed 
canary  grass,  or  purple  loosestrife.  Bog  turtle  colonies  are  isolated  with  habitat  fragmentation, 
which  has  the  potential  to  result  in  decreased  genetic  diversity  and  to  impact  the  colonization  of 
new  sites.  Bog  turtles  are  also  killed  when  trying  to  cross  roadways  that  split  wetlands 
(CWFNJ  2014-TN3288). 

The  bog  turtle  was  recorded  historically  for  Artificial  Island  and  vicinity  during  a  study  conducted 
between  1972  and  1978.  There  were  no  records  for  this  species  in  the  latest  surveys  conducted 
by  PSEG  in  2009  to  2010.  Methods  used  for  surveying  reptiles  and  amphibians  on  the  PSEG  Site 
during  2009  to  2010  included  general  site  reconnaissance  and  observation,  evening  anuran  (frog) 
call  surveys  in  the  spring,  and  transect  surveys  along  eight  transects  also  used  for  bird  and 
mammal  surveys.  Representative  portions  of  the  proposed  causeway  and  areas  adjacent  to  the 
existing  access  road  were  also  surveyed  qualitatively  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Sensitive  joint-vetch.  The  sensitive  joint-vetch  ( Aeschynomene  virginica)  is  Federally-listed 
threatened.  It  is  a  member  of  the  legume  family  that  can  grow  up  to  6  ft  tall.  It  is  an  annual  with 
yellow  flowers  that  cluster  on  short  lateral  branches  (FWS  2014-TN3319).  Germination  occurs 
in  May  to  June,  and  it  flowers  from  July  to  September  and  sometimes  into  October. 

Habitat  for  the  sensitive  joint-vetch  includes  intertidal  zones  that  are  fresh  or  slightly  salty  in 
areas  with  extensive  marshes  that  are  subject  to  two  cycles  of  flooding  a  day  (FWS  2014- 
TN3319).  The  sensitive  joint-vetch  prefers  sediments  that  are  bare  or  contain  sparse  vegetation 
along  river  banks  within  6  ft  of  the  low  water  mark.  It  can  also  occur  in  tidal  marsh  interiors, 
such  as  those  associated  with  swales  or  areas  of  muskrat  eat-out  and  accreting  point  bars. 

Sensitive  joint-vetch  is  threatened  by  dredging  and  filling  of  marshes,  dam  construction, 
shoreline  stabilization,  commercial  and  residential  development,  sedimentation,  impoundments, 
water  withdrawal  projects,  invasive  plants,  introduced  insect  pests,  pollution,  recreational 
activities,  agricultural  activities,  mining  timber  harvest,  and  saltwater  intrusion  due  to  sea-level 
rise  (FWS  2014-TN3319).  It  is  listed  as  historically  occurring  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site 
and  may  still  be  present.  The  2009  survey  did  not  indicate  that  it  was  present  on  the  site  or  in 
the  vicinity. 

Swamp  pink.  The  swamp  pink  (Helonias  bullata)  is  Federally-listed  as  threatened  (FWS  2014- 
TN3320).  It  is  a  perennial  member  of  the  lily  family  with  dark  green  leaves  that  are  smooth  and 
oblong  and  form  an  evergreen  rosette  at  its  base.  The  leaves  can  been  seen  year  round.  Its 
flower  stalks  can  grow  over  3  ft  tall  and  are  topped  with  a  1  to  3  in.  long  cluster  of  30  to  50  small 
pink  flowers  with  blue  anthers.  It  flowers  in  the  spring  between  March  and  May  (FWS  2014- 
TN3321 ).

Affected  Environment 


Swamp  pink  is  an  obligate  wetland  species  and  occurs  in  a  variety  of  palustrine  forested 
wetlands  with  canopy  closures  of  20  to  100  percent.  It  can  be  found  co-located  with  Atlantic 
white-cedar  ( Chamaecyparis  thyoides),  red  maple,  pitch  pine  ( Pinus  rigida),  American  larch 
{Larix  laricina),  black  spruce  ( Picea  mariana),  red  spruce  (P.  rubens),  sweet  pepperbush 
( Clethra  a  Ini  folia),  sweetbay  magnolia  ( Magnolia  virginiana),  sphagnum  mosses  ( Sphagnum 
spp.),  cinnamon  fern  ( Osmunda  cinnamomea),  skunk  cabbage  ( Symplocarpus  foetidus),  and 
laurels  ( Kalmia  spp.).  Swamp  pink  is  limited  to  wetlands  that  are  perennially  saturated,  but  not 
inundated,  by  flood  waters.  It  prefers  areas  where  the  water  table  is  at  or  near  the  surface  with 
only  slight  fluctuations  during  the  spring  and  summer,  such  as  areas  with  groundwater  seepage 
and  lateral  movement  (FWS  2014-TN3321). 

The  primary  threats  to  this  species  are  from  pollution  (such  as  sediment  from  construction), 
invasive  species,  and  changes  to  the  groundwater  that  could  be  caused  by  development  or 
offsite  activities.  Other  threats  include  wetland  clearing,  draining,  and  filling;  collection; 
trampling;  and  climate  change  (FWS  2014-TN3321 ). 

It  is  known  to  or  believed  to  occur  in  the  following  New  Jersey  counties:  Atlantic,  Burlington, 
Camden,  Cape  May,  Cumberland,  Gloucester,  Middlesex,  Monmouth,  Morris,  Ocean,  and 
Salem.  In  Delaware,  swamp  pink  is  known  to  or  believed  to  occur  in  Kent,  New  Castle,  and 
Sussex  counties  (FWS  2014-TN3321 ).  Less  than  1  percent  of  the  PSEG  Site  contains  habitat 
suitable  to  support  swamp  pink,  and  its  occurrence  was  not  noted  in  surveys  conducted  in  2009. 

Small  whorled  poqonia.  The  small  whorled  pogonia  ( Isotria  medeoloides)  is  Federally-listed  as 
threatened.  It  is  a  perennial  member  of  the  orchid  family  that  can  grow  2  to  14  in.  in  height.  It 
possesses  a  whorl  of  five  or  six  milky  green  leaves  near  the  top  of  the  stem  beneath  a  solitary 
or  paired  greenish-yellow  flower.  It  blooms  from  May  to  June,  and  its  capsule  matures  in  the  fall 
(FWS  2014-TN3322). 

The  small  whorled  pogonia  grows  in  a  variety  of  habitats  including  upland,  mid-successional, 
and  wooded,  usually  with  mixed-deciduous  or  mixed-deciduous/coniferous  forests  with  canopy 
trees  ranging  from  40  to  75  years  old.  Canopy  species  in  habitat  preferred  by  small  whorled 
pogonia  consist  of  red  maple,  eastern  hemlock  ( Tsuga  canadensis),  northern  red  oak  ( Quercias 
rubra),  white  oak  ( Q .  alba),  black  oak  (Q.  velutina),  scarlet  oak  ( Q .  coccinea),  white  pine  ( Pinus 
strobus),  American  beech  (Fagus  grandifolia),  sweet  gum  ,  and  tulip  poplar  ( Liriodendron 
tuiipifera).  Typically,  the  canopy  trees  are  8  to  18  in.  in  diameter. 

Small  whorled  pogonia  prefers  areas  with  sparse  ground  layer  vegetation  and  acid  dry  soils  that 
lie  on  a  gentle  slope.  It  is  associated  with  the  following  ground  layer  species:  partridge  berry 
( Mitchella  repens),  Indian  cucumber  root  ( Medeola  virginiana),  New  York  fern  ( Theiypteris 
noveboracensis),  sweet  lowbush  blueberry  (Vaccinium pallidum),  rattlesnake  plantain 
( Goodyera  pubescens),  red  maple  seedlings,  oak  seedlings,  Canada  mayflower  ( Maianthemum 
canadense),  wintergreen  ( Gauitheria  procumbens),  starflower  ( Trientalis  borealis),  running 
cedar  ( Lycopodium  digitatum),  Virginia  creeper  ( Padhenocissus  guinguefolia),  cat-brier  ( Smilax 
glauca),  and  Christmas  fern  ( Polystichum  acrostichoides)  (FWS  2014-TN3322). 

The  primary  threat  to  the  small  whorled  pogonia  is  habitat  destruction.  Other  threats  include 
collection,  inadvertent  damage,  and  recreation.  It  is  not  known  or  believed  to  occur  in  Salem

County,  and  its  nearest  known  location  in  New  Jersey  is  Sussex  County  in  the  north 
(FWS  2014-TN3322).  The  PSEG  Site  lacks  suitable  habitat  for  the  small  whorled  pogonia,  and 
surveys  conducted  in  2009  did  not  reveal  any  on  the  site  or  the  vicinity.  It  is  listed  as  having  the 
potential  to  occur  in  New  Castle  County,  Delaware,  which  is  within  the  6  mi  vicinity. 

Northern  long-eared  bat.  The  northern  long-eared  bat  is  listed  Federally  as  threatened.  The 
northern  long-eared  bat  is  distributed  in  39  states,  including  New  Jersey.  Hibernacula  are 
typically  found  in  small  crevices  or  cracks  on  cave  or  mine  walls  or  ceilings,  and  seven  known 
sites  occur  within  New  Jersey.  Hibernacula  used  by  northern  long-eared  bats  are  typically 
large,  with  large  passages,  constant  cool  temperatures,  high  humidity,  and  no  air  currents. 
Additionally,  northern  long-eared  bats  have  been  seen  overwintering  in  railroad  tunnels,  storm 
sewer,  and  other  unsuspected  retreats.  In  the  summer,  northern  long-eared  bats  roost 
underneath  bark  or  in  crevices  or  cavities  of  live  trees  and  snags  of  various  tree  species.  Tree 
species  include  black  oak,  northern  red  oak,  silver  maple  (Acer  saccharinum),  black  locust 
( Robinia  pseudoacacia ),  American  beech,  sugar  maple  (Acer  saccharum),  sourwood 
( Oxydendrum  arboreum),  and  shortleaf  pine  ( Pinus  echinata ).  They  also  have  been  observed 
roosting  in  or  under  the  eaves  of  human-made  structures  such  as  bams,  buildings,  sheds,  and 
cabins. 

Northern  long-eared  bats  are  not  a  long-distance  migratory  species,  and  movements  between 
summer  and  winter  hibernacula  are  between  35  and  55  mi.  Breeding  occurs  between  late  July 
and  early  October.  Home  ranges  are  approximately  46  to  425  ac  for  females  and  161  ac  for 
males.  Northern  long-eared  bats  emerge  at  dusk  and  fly  along  hillsides  through  forest 
understory  gleaning  insects  from  vegetation.  Northern  long-eared  bats  have  a  diverse  diet  of 
insects,  most  commonly  beetles,  moths,  and  arachnids.  Mature  forests  are  an  important  habitat 
for  the  northern  long-eared  bat’s  foraging  technique.  The  primary  threat  to  the  northern 
long-eared  bat  is  attributed  to  white  nose  disease  caused  by  the  fungus  Geomyces  destructans 
(78  FR  61046-TN3207). 

Maternity  roosts  and  hibernacula  for  the  northern  long-eared  bat  are  known  to  occur  in  the 
following  New  Jersey  counties:  Atlantic,  Bergen,  Burlington,  Camden,  Hunterdon,  Mercer, 
Morris,  Ocean,  Passaic,  Salem.  Somerset,  Sussex,  and  Warren  (FWS  2014-TN3208).  No 
surveys  were  conducted  on  the  PSEG  Site  for  bats  species.  However,  suitable  habitat  for 
hibernacula  and  maternity  roosts  and  habitat  important  for  foraging  does  not  exist  on  the  PSEG 
Site.  Northern  long-eared  bat  are  known  to  occur  in  the  northern  and  central  portions  of  Salem 
County,  New  Jersey,  within  the  PSEG  Site  6-mi  vicinity  (78  FR  61046-TN3207). 

Rufa  red  knot.  The  rufa  red  knot  is  Federally  listed  as  threatened,  New  Jersey  State-listed  as 
endangered,  and  Delaware  State-listed  as  endangered.  Rufa  red  knots  are  9  to  1 1  in.  in  length 
and  considered  a  medium-sized  shorebird  (79  FR  73705-TN4267). 

Rufa  red  knots  migrate  annually  between  their  breeding  grounds  in  the  Canadian  Arctic  and 
wintering  locations  in  the  southeastern  United  States,  northeastern  Gulf  of  Mexico,  northern 
Brazil,  and  Tierra  del  Fuego  (located  on  the  southern  tip  of  Argentina).  Refa  red  knots  use  the 
Delaware  Bay  as  a  final  stopover  for  migrations  to  breeding  grounds  in  the  spring.

Rufa  red  knots  are  found  primarily  on  beaches  of  sand  or  peat  at  the  mouths  of  tidal  creeks, 
along  the  edge  of  tidal  marshes  dominated  by  salt  marsh  cordgrass  ( Spartina  alterniflora)  and 
saltmeadow  cordgrass  (S.  patens),  and  in  salt  pannes  (i.e.,  shallow,  high  salinity,  mud-bottomed 
depressions  on  the  marsh  surface)  and  shallow  coastal  ponds  or  embayments.  Radio  tracking 
has  shown  that  rufa  red  knots  usually  roost  along  the  shoreline  or  in  sandy  washovers  above 
the  high  tide  line;  however,  they  also  roost  in  bare,  shallow-water  openings  0.5  to  1 .3  mi  (850  to 
2,050  m)  inland  in  adjacent  salt  marsh.  The  preference  for  inland  roost  sites  is  greater  at  night 
and  during  spring  tides,  and  Delaware  Bay  is  the  only  area  in  which  rufa  red  knots  have  been 
observed  roosting  inland. 

Rufa  red  knots  must  take  advantage  of  seasonally  abundant  food  resources  at  migration 
stopovers  to  build  up  fat  reserves  for  the  next  leg  of  migration.  Delaware  Bay  serves  as  a 
seasonal  migration  stopover  for  rufa  red  knots  due  to  the  abundance  of  horseshoe  crab  eggs. 

The  primary  threats  to  rufa  red  knot  populations  along  the  Delaware  Bay  include  sea-level  rise, 
shoreline  stabilization,  and  coastal  development.  The  rufa  red  knot  is  not  known  to,  or  believed 
to,  occur  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The  nearest  known  occurrence  of  the  rufa  red  knot  is  in 
adjacent  counties  (i.e.,  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey  and  Kent  County,  Delaware).  The 
PSEG  Site  does  not  contain  suitable  habitat  to  support  migrating  rufa  red  knots.  The  rufa  red 
knot  was  not  recorded  in  the  2009  to  2010  field  surveys  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Further 
horseshoe  crabs  have  not  been  reported  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  or 
in  offsite  small  and  large  marsh  creeks  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005- 
TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009- 
TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011-TN2571;  PSEG  2013-TN2586). 

Northern  goshawk.  The  northern  goshawk  (Accipiter gentilis)  is  New  Jersey  State-listed  as 
endangered  for  breeding  population  and  special  concern  for  nonbreeding  population.  It  is  listed 
because  of  the  limitation  of  habitat  available  for  breeding  (NJDEP  2012-TN3247). 

Northern  goshawks  nest  in  mature,  contiguous  forests  away  from  human  activity  and 
development.  They  may  also  nest  in  wooded  swamps,  lower  gentle  slopes,  or  flat  areas  at 
higher  elevations.  Nests  may  be  located  in  either  deciduous  or  coniferous  trees,  although 
deciduous  trees  are  used  more  frequently  in  New  Jersey  (NJDEP  2012-TN3247).  Northern 
goshawks  breed  in  areas  with  large-sized  trees,  a  closed  canopy,  and  an  open  understory 
(PSEG  2012-TN2389). 

Outside  the  breeding  season,  goshawks  frequent  a  wider  variety  of  habitat  types.  In  migration 
and  during  winter,  they  may  forage  in  mature  as  well  as  young  woods,  scrubby  areas,  and  tree 
lines  along  marshes  or  open  fields.  Forested  areas  are  favored  for  roosting  because  they 
provide  protection  against  the  weather.  The  greatest  threat  to  the  northern  goshawk  is  habitat 
destruction  (NJDEP  2012-TN3247).  Northern  goshawks  have  been  reported  in  the  project 
vicinity  during  recent  (2008  to  2009)  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Counts  for  Salem 
County  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  Audubon  201 3-TN2414).  The  northern  goshawk  may  use  the 
PSEG  Site  and  vicinity  periodically  for  foraging  during  migration  or  during  the  winter. 

Grasshopper  Sparrow.  The  grasshopper  sparrow  ( Ammodramus  savannarum)  is  New  Jersey 
State-listed  as  threatened  for  the  breeding  population  and  special  concern  for  the  nonbreeding

population.  Preferred  habitat  for  the  grasshopper  sparrow  consists  of  short  to  medium  bunch 
grasses  interspersed  with  bare  ground,  shallow  litter  layer,  scattered  forbs,  and  few  shrubs 
(CWFNJ  2012-TN3248). 

Grasshopper  sparrows  prefer  to  nest  in  open  habitats  including  agricultural  lands  and  airports 
that  contain  suitable  habitat.  These  sparrows  breed  in  grasslands,  upland  meadows,  pastures, 
hay  fields,  and  old  field  habitats.  They  may  use  small  grassland,  but  they  prefer  areas  greater 
than  99  ac.  Nests  are  constructed  by  the  females  near  the  base  of  a  clump  of  grass  in  a 
shallow  depression.  Habitat  loss  is  the  primary  threat  to  the  grasshopper  sparrow 
(CWFNJ  2012-TN3248). 

One  grasshopper  sparrow  was  observed  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  in  the  spring  during  the 
2009  to  2010  PSEG  survey.  Grasshopper  sparrows  have  also  been  reported  in  the  USGS 
North  American  Breeding  Bird  Survey  (BBS)  bird  count  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  PSEG  Site 
provides  some  limited  habitat  for  this  species,  with  some  higher  quality  habitat  present  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  site. 

Cattle  egret.  The  cattle  egret  is  New  Jersey  State-listed  as  threatened  for  the  breeding 
population  and  special  concern  for  the  nonbreeding  population.  Cattle  egrets  are  very  common 
around  the  United  States  and  the  world,  but  changes  in  land  use  from  livestock  operations  have 
caused  their  population  to  decline  in  New  Jersey.  This  species  of  egret  prefers  to  forage  and 
roost  in  agricultural  fields  and  pastures  and  nest  in  mixed  species  colonies  on  marsh  islands 
(NJDEP  2012-TN3249). 

Cattle  egrets  were  observed  in  fairly  good  numbers  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  during  the 
2009  to  2010  PSEG  survey,  mainly  in  the  spring  and  fall.  They  also  were  recorded  during  the 
BBS  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  PSEG  Site  may  provide  limited  foraging  habitat  for  this 
species,  with  higher  quality  foraging  habitat  being  present  in  the  site  vicinity. 

Red-shouldered  hawk.  The  red-shouldered  hawk  ( Buteo  lineatus )  is  New  Jersey  State-listed  as 
endangered  for  breeding  population  and  special  concern  for  nonbreeding  population.  Red¬ 
shouldered  hawks  prefer  wetland  forests  as  well  as  uplands,  fragmented  woods,  small  forests, 
open  areas,  and  edges  (NJDEP  2014-TN3254). 

Their  nesting  habitat  includes  deciduous,  coniferous,  and  mixed  woodland  remote  old  growth 
forests  with  standing  water,  closed  upper  canopies,  and  open  subcanopies.  They  nest  in  large 
deciduous  trees  and  sometimes  coniferous  trees.  Nesting  habitats  in  southern  New  Jersey 
include  hardwood  or  mixed  hardwood/cedar  swamps  containing  red  maple,  black  gum  ( Nyssa 
sylvatica),  sassafras  ( Sassafras  albidum ),  sweetbay  magnolia,  and  Atlantic  white  cedar.  They 
require  large  continuous  wooded  tracts  for  breeding,  typically  270  to  838  ac  for  the  eastern 
populations,  with  average  distances  of  about  0.75  to  1 .0  mi  between  nests.  Habitat  loss  is  the 
primary  threat  to  red-shouldered  hawks  (NJDEP  2014-TN3254). 

No  red-shouldered  hawks  were  observed  during  the  2009  to  2010  field  survey.  However,  they 
have  been  identified  near  the  site  during  recent  (2009  to  2010)  Audubon  Society  Annual 
Christmas  Bird  Counts  for  Salem  County  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  Audubon  2013-TN2414). 

This  species  was  also  recorded  during  past  work  conducted  in  the  Alloway  Creek  watershed

(PSEG  2004-TN2897).  The  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity  provides  foraging  habitat  for  this  species, 
while  larger  wooded  areas  in  the  vicinity  provide  potential  nesting  habitat.  Preferred  nesting 
habitat  is  not  available  on  the  PSEG  Site. 

Northern  harrier.  The  northern  harrier  is  New  Jersey  State-listed  as  endangered  for  the 
breeding  population  and  special  concern  for  the  nonbreeding  population  and  Delaware 
State-listed  as  endangered.  Northern  harriers  prefer  open  tidal  marshes,  emergent  wetlands, 
fallow  fields,  grasslands,  meadows,  airports,  and  agricultural  areas.  Northern  harriers  will  build 
nests  in  brackish  or  saline  marshes  along  the  Delaware  Bay  shores  in  salt  hay  ( Spartina 
patens ),  marsh  elder  (Iva  frutescens),  or  reed  grass  ( Phragmites  communis).  They  will  also 
nest  in  freshwater  tidal  marshes  containing  common  reed  or  sedges.  However,  common  reed 
makes  for  poor  foraging  habitat  because  of  the  thick  stands  it  forms  (NJDEP  2014-TN3255). 

Habitat  loss  is  the  greatest  threat  to  northern  harriers  in  New  Jersey  (NJDEP  2014-TN3255). 
The  PSEG  Site  does  contain  marsh  habitat  that  may  provide  nesting  and  foraging  habitat  for  the 
northern  harrier.  During  the  2009  to  2010  field  survey,  northern  harriers  were  commonly 
observed  in  all  seasons.  Sightings  were  near  open  areas,  both  on  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity. 
They  were  observed  foraging  above  the  marsh.  Although  northern  harriers  were  not  confirmed 
nesting  on  the  site  or  in  the  vicinity,  they  are  ground  nesters  and  could  potentially  nest  near  the 
study  area.  The  northern  harrier  was  also  identified  near  the  PSEG  Site  during  BBS  and  recent 
(2005  to  2010)  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Counts  for  Salem  County  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280;  Audubon  2013-TN2414).  This  species  was  also  recorded  during  past  work  conducted 
in  the  Alloway  Creek  watershed  (PSEG  2004-TN2897). 

Bobolink.  The  bobolink  ( Dolichonyx  oryzivorus)  is  New  Jersey  State-listed  as  threatened  for  the 
breeding  population  and  special  concern  for  the  nonbreeding  population.  In  1979,  the  bobolink 
was  listed  by  the  State  of  New  Jersey  as  threatened  because  of  population  decline  and  habitat 
loss.  During  the  breeding  season  (early  summer),  bobolinks  frequent  low-intensity  agricultural 
areas,  including  hayfields  and  pastures.  They  also  may  be  found  in  fallow  fields  and  meadows 
that  contain  grasses,  forbs,  and  wildflowers.  The  highest  densities  of  bobolinks  are  found  in 
larger  fields;  however,  they  may  also  nest  in  smaller  fields  of  5  to  10  ac.  Following  the  breeding 
season  in  late  June  to  early  July,  bobolinks  frequent  freshwater  and  coastal  marshes  where 
they  will  stay  for  several  weeks  while  molting.  A  second  influx  of  migrating  bobolinks  occurs 
along  the  Atlantic  and  Delaware  Bay  coasts  in  late  August  (CWFNJ  2012-TN3271 ). 

Females  will  choose  the  nest  site,  which  is  established  on  the  ground  near  a  large  clump  of 
grass.  Bobolinks  winter  in  South  America.  The  greatest  threat  to  the  bobolink  is  the  loss  of 
preferred  habitat  such  as  agricultural  fields  (CWFNJ  2012-TN3271 ).  One  bobolink  was 
observed  on  the  site  in  the  spring  during  the  2009  to  2010  PSEG  survey  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
Bobolink  nesting  habitat  is  not  available  on  the  PSEG  Site. 

Horned  lark.  The  horned  lark  ( Eremophila  alpestris)  is  New  Jersey  State-listed  as  threatened 
for  breeding  population  and  special  concern  for  nonbreeding  population.  This  is  the  only  true 
lark  native  to  the  New  World  (CWFNJ  2012-TN3256). 

Horned  larks  prefer  open  habitats  with  short,  sparse  grasses  and  wildflowers,  bare  ground,  and 
few  shrubs.  They  will  leave  sites  as  vegetation  becomes  denser.  Horned  larks  have  become

increasingly  localized  in  New  Jersey.  They  are  most  common  in  the  Wallkill  River  Valley,  parts 
of  Warren,  Salem,  and  Cumberland  counties,  and  Lakehurst  Naval  Station  in  Ocean  County. 
They  will  frequent  mowed  areas  around  airstrips  where  suitable  agricultural  and  nonforested 
habitats  are  rare  (CWFNJ  2012-TN3256). 

Horned  larks  eat  mostly  weed  seeds,  grass  seeds,  and  waste  grains.  Young  are  fed  insects, 
and  adults  also  eat  some  insects,  such  as  grasshoppers,  caterpillars,  ants,  and  wasps 
(CWFNJ  2012-TN3256).  They  also  may  eat  snails,  fruits,  and  berries  (PSEG  2012-TN2389). 

The  horned  lark  is  one  of  the  earliest  birds  to  nest,  with  males  establishing  territories  in  January 
and  February.  Females  build  nests  in  small  depressions  on  the  bare  ground  next  to  bunch 
grasses  or  other  plants,  and  nests  are  lined  with  fine  plant  materials.  The  greatest  threats  to  the 
horned  lark  include  loss  of  habitat  and  native  plant  species  (CWFNJ  2012-TN3256). 

One  horned  lark  was  observed  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  in  the  spring  during  the  2009  to 
2010  PSEG  survey.  Horned  larks  also  have  been  reported  in  the  BBS  and  during  recent 
(2008  to  2010)  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Counts  for  Salem  County  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280;  Audubon  2013-TN2414).  The  PSEG  Site  provides  some  limited  habitat  for  this 
species,  with  some  higher  quality  habitat  present  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site. 

Peregrine  falcon.  The  peregrine  falcon  ( Falco  peregrinus)  is  New  Jersey  State-listed  as 
endangered  for  the  breeding  population,  and  special  concern  for  the  nonbreeding  population. 
Historically,  peregrine  falcon  nest  sites  were  restricted  to  cliffs  and  rock  outcroppings.  With 
increased  human  development,  they  began  to  nest  on  human-made  structures.  There  are  no 
remaining  peregrine  falcon  cliff  nests  in  New  Jersey.  Artificial  nest  platforms  were  erected 
during  the  days  of  peregrine  population  recovery,  and  these  platforms  are  still  used  today. 
Peregrines  favor  open  areas  for  foraging  and  frequently  hunt  over  marshes,  beaches,  or  open 
water  (NJDEP  2014-TN3316). 

They  feed  mainly  on  birds,  including  passerines  and  small  geese.  They  occasionally  eat 
mammals  and  rarely  eat  amphibians,  fish,  or  insects  (White  et  al.  2002-TN3329).  Peregrine 
falcons  have  been  reported  in  the  PSEG  Site  vicinity  during  recent  (2005  to  2006)  Audubon 
Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Counts  for  Salem  County  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  Audubon  2013- 
TN2414).  The  main  threats  to  the  peregrine  falcon  are  chemical  contaminants  such  as  PCBs 
and  predation  from  other  species  such  as  the  great  horned  owl  ( Bubo  virginianus) 

(NJDEP  2014-TN3316). 

American  kestrel.  The  American  kestrel  ( Falco  sparverius)  is  New  Jersey  State-listed  as 
threatened  for  both  breeding  and  nonbreeding  populations.  American  kestrels  frequent  large, 
open  areas  with  low  vegetation  and  are,  therefore,  attracted  to  managed  areas  such  as  farms, 
parks,  and  pastures.  Habitat  preferences  vary  between  sexes  outside  the  breeding  season, 
with  males  preferring  more  forested  areas  and  females  still  preferring  areas  that  are  more  open. 
Kestrels  hunt  from  available  perches  (branches,  utility  lines,  etc.)  or  hover,  preying  on  insects, 
reptiles,  mice,  voles,  and  sometimes  birds  (NJDEP  2012-TN3257). 

Kestrels  are  secondary  cavity  nesters,  utilizing  natural  cavities  and  woodpecker  holes.  They  will 
also  use  nesting  opportunities  provided  by  man,  including  cavities  in  the  eaves  of  buildings  and

barns,  and  nest  boxes.  These  provide  important  nesting  space  for  kestrels  impacted  by  snag 
removal  and  competition  from  other  species  (e.g.,  squirrels  and  European  starlings).  The  lack 
of  suitable  nest  sites  is  one  theory  for  the  decline  of  kestrel  numbers  in  recent  years.  Kestrel 
numbers  are  particularly  experiencing  declines  in  the  northeast  where  lack  of  nesting  sites  is 
thought  to  be  a  factor.  The  shift  away  from  farmland  to  development  and  reforestation  is  a 
contributing  factor  to  habitat  loss.  Critical  habitat  disappears  as  urban  and  suburban 
development  fragment  large  open  areas  into  smaller  patches.  The  increase  in  raptor  species 
including  Cooper’s  and  sharp-shinned  hawks  may  be  another  factor  for  the  decline.  Presence 
of  West  Nile  virus  in  this  species  may  also  be  a  concern.  Fortunately,  nest  box  programs  have 
been  successful  in  providing  viable  nesting  habitat  (NJDEP  2012-TN3257). 

American  kestrels  have  been  reported  in  the  PSEG  Site  vicinity  by  BBS  and  during  recent 
(2005  to  2010)  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Counts  for  Salem  County  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280;  Audubon  201 3-TN2414).  This  species  was  also  recorded  during  past  work  conducted 
in  the  Alloway  Creek  watershed  (PSEG  2004-TN2897). 

Bald  eagle.  The  bald  eagle  is  New  Jersey  State-listed  as  endangered  for  the  breeding  population 
and  as  threatened  for  the  nonbreeding  population  and  Delaware  State-listed  as  endangered.  It 
was  removed  from  the  Federal  endangered  species  list  in  2007.  However,  it  is  still  protected 
Federally  under  the  Bald  and  Golden  Eagle  Protection  Act  (16  USC  668  et  seq.  -TN1447) .  By 
1970,  only  one  bald  eagle  nest  remained  in  New  Jersey,  and  the  species  was  listed  as 
endangered.  Bald  eagles  reside  year-round  in  New  Jersey  and  typically  remain  in  the  vicinity  of 
their  nest  site.  The  largest  concentration  of  bald  eagles  is  along  the  Delaware  Bay  in  Salem  and 
Cumberland  counties.  Bald  eagles  also  are  present  in  central  and  northern  New  Jersey  near 
lakes,  reservoirs,  and  rivers.  They  may  move  southward  in  winter  from  the  northern  parts  of  their 
range  and  may  stop  over  in  New  Jersey.  During  the  January  2008  midwinter  eagle  survey, 

264  bald  eagles  were  recorded  in  New  Jersey;  this  was  the  highest  count  since  surveys  began  in 
1978  (CWFNJ  2012-TN3258). 

Bald  eagles  roost  in  forested  areas  but  forage  near  water  bodies  in  areas  such  as  rivers,  lakes, 
and  marshes.  They  nest  in  the  tops  of  large,  mature  trees  and  typically  use  the  same  nests 
year  after  year.  Juvenile  birds  generally  leave  the  area  in  late  August  and  may  winter  in  the 
Chesapeake  Bay  area,  where  open  water  and  food  are  abundant  (PSEG  2015-TN4280; 

CWFNJ  2012-TN3258). 

Because  of  their  large  size,  bald  eagles  require  a  large  foraging  area.  The  main  prey  for  bald 
eagles  is  fish,  but  they  are  opportunistic  and  also  will  feed  on  waterfowl,  turtles,  rabbits,  snakes, 
muskrats,  other  small  animals,  and  carrion  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  CWFNJ  2012-TN3258).  Bald 
eagles  use  a  sit-and-watch  foraging  behavior  from  large  perch  trees  near  water.  In  New  Jersey, 
ideal  locations  for  foraging  are  the  Delaware  River,  Delaware  Bay,  and  associated  tidal  marshes 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

During  the  2009  to  2010  field  survey,  bald  eagles  were  occasionally  observed  flying  on  the  site 
and  perched  along  the  Delaware  River  at  the  south  end  of  the  PSEG  Site  during  all  seasons. 
Bald  eagle  use  of  the  PSEG  Site  is  most  likely  for  foraging.  Bald  eagles  have  been  recorded  in 
recent  years  (2005  to  2010)  near  the  site  during  the  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird 
Count  for  Salem  County  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  Audubon  2013-TN2414).  In  nesting  surveys

conducted  annually  by  the  NJDEP,  during  the  five-year  span  from  2004  to  2008,  bald  eagles 
had  nested  within  a  6-mi  radius  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Two  nests  were  confirmed  (one  near  the 
town  of  Elsinboro,  and  the  other  along  Alloway  Creek)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  This  species  was 
also  recorded  during  past  work  conducted  in  the  Alloway  Creek  watershed  (PSEG  2004- 
TN2897). 

Red-headed  woodpecker.  The  red-headed  woodpecker  ( Melanerpes  erythrocephalus)  was 
listed  in  New  Jersey  in  1979  as  threatened  for  both  breeding  and  nonbreeding  populations.  The 
decline  of  red-headed  woodpeckers  is  a  result  of  mortality  from  vehicle  collisions,  competition 
with  the  European  starling  for  nesting  sites,  harvesting  of  feathers  for  hats,  and  killing  by 
farmers  because  of  damage  to  fruit  and  berry  crops.  Red-headed  woodpecker  habitat  includes 
open  woods,  deciduous  forests,  forest  edges,  river  bottoms,  orchards,  grasslands  with  scattered 
trees,  and  clearings.  They  prefer  areas  with  dead  or  dying  trees  that  provide  cavities  for  nesting 
and  sparse  undergrowth  to  facilitate  foraging  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Red-headed  woodpeckers  have  an  omnivorous  diet  consisting  of  insects,  spiders,  worms,  nuts, 
seeds,  berries,  fruit,  and  occasionally  small  mammals.  They  may  also  eat  the  young  and  eggs 
of  bluebirds,  house  sparrows,  and  chickadees.  They  search  for  food  from  either  a  perch  or  the 
ground.  Much  of  the  food  found  by  red-headed  woodpeckers  is  stored  in  existing  natural  or 
human-made  cavities  or  crevices.  No  red-headed  woodpeckers  were  observed  during  the  2009 
to  2010  field  survey,  nor  have  they  been  reported  in  the  BBS  or  the  Audubon  Society  Annual 
Christmas  Bird  Counts  for  Salem  County.  Suitable  nesting  habitat  for  the  red-headed 
woodpecker  is  not  available  on  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Black-crowned  night-heron.  The  black-crowned  night-heron  is  New  Jersey  State-listed  as 
threatened  for  the  breeding  population  and  as  special  concern  for  the  nonbreeding  population. 
The  black-crowned  night-heron  was  a  historically  common  breeding  species  along  the  New 
Jersey  coast.  The  population  decline  is  attributed  to  habitat  destruction,  disturbance  of  nesting 
colonies,  and  contaminants  (NJDEP  2012-TN3259). 

Nesting,  roosting,  and  foraging  habitat  for  black-crowned  night-herons  includes  forests, 
shrub/scrub,  marshes,  and  ponds.  Heronries  may  be  located  in  wooded  swamps,  coastal  dune 
forests,  vegetated  dredge  spoil  islands,  scrub  thickets,  or  mixed  Phragmites  marshes  that  are 
close  to  water.  Black-crowned  night-herons  forage  in  marshes  and  along  pond  edges  and 
creeks.  Shallow  tidal  pools,  tidal  channels,  mudflats,  and  vegetated  marsh  also  provide 
foraging  habitat  in  coastal  salt  marshes  (NJDEP  2012-TN3259). 

The  black-crowned  night-heron  is  an  opportunistic  feeder  that  prefers  foraging  in  shallow  water. 
The  diet  of  this  species  consists  primarily  of  fish;  the  diet  also  may  include  leeches,  earthworms, 
and  aguatic  and  terrestrial  insects.  These  herons  also  eat  crayfish,  mussels,  sguid,  amphibians, 
lizards,  snakes,  rodents,  birds,  eggs,  carrion,  plant  materials,  and  garbage  and  refuse  from 
landfills  (PSEG  2012-TN1489). 

Black-crowned  night-herons  were  observed  in  low  numbers  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site  along 
Alloway  and  Hope  Creeks  in  spring  and  summer  during  the  2009  to  2010  PSEG  survey.  They 
were  also  recorded  during  BBS  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  This  species  also  was  recorded  during 
past  work  conducted  in  the  Alloway  Creek  watershed  (PSEG  2004-TN2897).

Osprey.  The  osprey  is  New  Jersey  State-listed  as  threatened  for  the  breeding  population.  The 
loss  of  nesting  sites  and  contamination  of  food  by  persistent  pesticides  (mainly  DDT)  caused  the 
decline  of  this  species  in  New  Jersey  and  throughout  the  eastern  United  States.  Nest  platforms 
have  been  installed  by  PSEG  in  the  ACW  Site  as  part  of  the  PSEG  EEP  program  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

Ospreys  frequent  areas  in  close  proximity  to  water  including  coastal  rivers,  marshes,  bays,  and 
inlets,  as  well  as  inland  rivers  and  lakes.  Ospreys  nest  on  live  or  dead  trees,  human-made 
nesting  platforms,  light  poles,  channel  markers,  abandoned  duck  blinds,  and  other  artificial 
structures  close  to  water  offering  unobstructed  views  of  the  surrounding  area.  The  osprey’s 
acceptance  and  use  of  these  artificial  nesting  sites  has  played  a  key  role  in  the  recovery  of  this 
species  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Ospreys  in  New  Jersey  arrive  on  their  breeding  grounds  in  late 
March.  Nests  are  constructed  of  sticks  and  lined  with  softer  vegetation.  Breeding  begins  in 
April  or  May.  Ospreys  leave  New  Jersey  for  their  wintering  grounds  in  late  August  to  early 
September  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  CWFNJ  2012-TN3260). 

Ospreys  in  New  Jersey  nest  along  the  Atlantic  Coast  from  Sandy  Hook  to  Cape  May  and 
on  the  Delaware  Bay  and  River  in  Cumberland,  Salem,  and  Gloucester  counties.  In  addition, 
reintroduction  efforts  on  northern  New  Jersey  lakes  have  resulted  in  ospreys  nesting  along 
the  upper  Delaware  River  (CWFNJ  2012-TN3260). 

The  osprey’s  main  diet  consists  of  fish.  Ospreys  are  opportunistic  and  will  eat  whatever  fish 
species  are  accessible.  However,  given  the  abundance  of  fish  in  a  given  area,  their  diet  may 
consist  of  only  two  to  three  species.  Ospreys  hunt  for  prey  while  in  flight  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

During  the  2009  to  2010  field  survey,  ospreys  were  occasionally  observed  in  the  spring  and 
summer  both  on  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Active  osprey  nests  were 
observed  on  transmission  towers  along  the  current  PSEG  access  road  from  the  plant  north 
toward  Money  Island  Road.  Nests  were  also  observed  on  human-made  nesting  platforms  along 
Alloway  Creek.  Ospreys  have  also  been  identified  near  the  site  in  the  BBS.  In  an  osprey 
nesting  and  productivity  study  conducted  annually  (beginning  in  2006)  by  the  New  Jersey 
Division  of  Fish  and  Wildlife,  it  was  reported  that  the  number  of  young  per  nest  in  the  Salem 
County-Artificial  Island  area  has  averaged  between  1.7  and  2.0  birds  from  2006  to  2008. 
Additionally,  The  Nature  Conservancy  has  conducted  an  annual  nesting  and  productivity  study 
on  PSEG  EEP  wetland  restoration  sites  since  1999.  The  Alloway  Creek  wetland  restoration  site 
is  the  only  site  within  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Nesting  platforms  have  been  monitored 
at  this  wetland  site  since  2001 ,  and  the  number  of  young  per  nest  has  ranged  from  zero  to  three 
for  2001  to  2009.  There  are  four  nesting  platforms  on  the  ACW  Site.  The  number  of  active 
nests  each  year  has  varied  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Savannah  Sparrow.  The  savannah  sparrow  ( Passerculus  sandwichensis)  is  New  Jersey  State- 
listed  as  threatened  for  the  breeding  population.  This  species  breeds  in  the  ridge  and  valley 
and  highlands  regions  of  northern  New  Jersey  and  in  the  inner  coastal  plain  of  southwestern 
New  Jersey.  The  savannah  sparrow  is  a  common  migrant  through  New  Jersey  from  mid- 
September  through  early  November  in  the  fall  and  from  mid-March  through  late  April  in  the 
spring.  This  sparrow  is  an  uncommon  winter  resident  seen  in  small  flocks  along  the  coast, 
inland  grasslands,  and  fields  (CWFNJ  2012-TN3261 ).

NUREG-2168 


Affected  Environment 


Savannah  sparrows  nest  in  a  variety  of  open  habitats.  For  a  field  to  be  suitable  for  savannah 
sparrows,  it  must  include  a  mix  of  short  and  tall  grasses,  a  thick  litter  layer,  dense  ground 
vegetation,  and  scattered  shrubs,  saplings,  or  forbs.  Savannah  sparrows  require  large 
grasslands  of  approximately  20  to  40  ac.  Near  the  ocean  they  may  also  frequent  tidal  salt 
marshes  and  estuaries.  Savannah  sparrows  depend  on  seasonally  abundant  food  sources. 
During  the  nesting  season,  savannah  sparrows  feed  on  invertebrates  such  as  insects,  larvae, 
and  caterpillars.  In  coastal  areas,  they  may  eat  tiny  crustaceans.  The  young  are  fed 
invertebrates,  along  with  fruit  and  berries.  A  cup  nest  constructed  by  the  female  is  concealed  by 
vegetation  in  a  slight  depression  on  the  ground.  The  nest  is  located  in  clumps  of  grass  or  at  the 
base  of  a  shrub  and  is  woven  of  thick  grasses  and  lined  with  thinner  grasses  (CWFNJ  2012- 
TN3261 ). 

Habitat  loss  and  modern  agricultural  practices  are  a  threat  to  nesting  savannah  sparrows  in 
New  Jersey.  The  amount  of  suitable  habitat  has  experienced  a  reduction  with  the  decline  in 
farming,  succession,  and  the  development  of  open  space  (CWFNJ  201 2-TN3261 ).  Two 
savannah  sparrows  were  observed  on  the  site  in  the  spring  during  the  2009  to  2010  PSEG 
survey.  They  have  also  been  reported  during  recent  (2009  to  2010)  Audubon  Society  Annual 
Christmas  Bird  Counts  for  Salem  County  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Pied-billed  grebe.  The  pied-billed  grebe  ( Podilymbus  podiceps)  is  New  Jersey  State-listed  as 
endangered  for  breeding  population  and  as  special  concern  for  nonbreeding  population  and 
Delaware  State-listed  as  endangered  for  breeding  population.  There  are  only  two  known 
breeding  sites  in  New  Jersey.  The  New  Jersey  Natural  Heritage  Program  considers  the  pied¬ 
billed  grebe  to  be  “critically  imperiled  in  New  Jersey”  (NJDEP  2012-TN3262). 

The  greatest  threats  to  pied-billed  grebe  populations  in  New  Jersey  are  habitat  degradation  and 
destruction  resulting  from  the  draining,  dredging,  filling,  pollution,  and  siltation  of  wetlands.  The 
breeding  habitat  for  this  species  (palustrine  emergent  wetlands,  inland  wetlands  such  as 
marshes  and  swamps  without  flowing  water,  and  less  than  0.5  percent  ocean-derived  salinity)  is 
one  of  the  most  threatened  wetland  types  in  the  United  States.  Pied-billed  grebes  nest  in 
freshwater  marshes  associated  with  ponds,  bogs,  lakes,  reservoirs,  or  slow  moving  rivers  and, 
infrequently,  in  coastal  estuaries  that  receive  minimal  tidal  fluctuations.  These  grebes  typically 
frequent  areas  with  emergent  or  aquatic  vegetation,  which  provides  good  locations  for  nesting 
sites.  Nests  float  and  are  anchored  to  marsh  vegetation  in  shallow  water.  Clutch  sizes  range 
from  2  to  10  eggs,  with  an  incubation  period  of  23  to  27  days.  The  breeding  season  starts  in 
April  and  runs  through  October.  They  frequent  a  greater  variety  of  habitats  outside  the  breeding 
season,  including  brackish  marshes,  estuaries,  inlets,  tidal  creeks,  and  coastal  bays.  Pied-billed 
grebes  eat  small  fish,  crustaceans,  and  aquatic  insects  and  their  larvae  (NJDEP  2012-TN3262; 
PSEG  2012-TN2389). 

The  PSEG  Site  does  contain  marshes  that  may  be  suitable  for  nesting  pied-billed  grebes. 
However,  pied-billed  grebes  were  not  observed  during  the  2009  to  2010  PSEG  survey.  They 
have  been  recorded  in  low  numbers  during  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Counts  for 
Salem  County  (2006  to  2007  and  2008  to  2009)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  Audubon  2013-TN2414). 

Eastern  tiger  salamander.  The  eastern  tiger  salamander  is  New  Jersey  State-listed  as 
endangered  and  Delaware  State-listed  as  endangered.  Tiger  salamanders  are  the  largest

salamander  species  in  New  Jersey.  Life  requirements  include  both  upland  and  wetland  habitat 
that  contain  ponds  suitable  for  breeding,  forested  areas,  and  soil  types  that  allow  burrowing 
(loamy  sand  and  sandy  loams  are  preferred).  Tiger  salamanders  remain  underground  much  of 
the  year  in  tunnels  and  burrows  or  under  logs.  They  emerge  from  their  burrows  from  late 
October  to  March  during  mild  temperatures  and  rain  that  trigger  nocturnal  movement.  Most 
juvenile  tiger  salamanders  will  emerge  in  July  and  disperse  to  underground  tunnels  and 
burrows.  With  the  loss  of  natural  breeding  ponds,  tiger  salamanders  have  used  gravel  pits  and 
farm  ponds.  Ponds  must  have  clean  water  and  be  free  of  fish  that  prey  on  salamander  eggs 
and  larvae.  Tiger  salamanders  require  ponds  that  hold  water  long  enough  for  metamorphosis 
to  be  completed,  yet  have  a  dry  period  that  will  prevent  predatory  fish  from  inhabiting  the  pond. 
Therefore,  breeding  ponds  are  usually  only  two  to  four  feet  deep  (CWFNJ  2012-TN3263). 

Terrestrial  habitats  that  may  be  frequented  by  tiger  salamanders  include  old  fields  and 
deciduous  or  mixed  woodlands  (e.g.,  oak  and  pine  or  oak  and  holly).  Vegetation  around  the 
ponds,  including  sedges  and  sphagnum  moss,  and  aquatic  vegetation  in  the  pond  itself  provide 
cover  for  these  salamanders.  Losses  of  habitat  and  pond  pollution  have  led  to  tiger  salamander 
declines  in  New  Jersey.  High  road  mortality  while  crossing  roads  to  breeding  ponds  is  also  a 
significant  impact.  The  New  Jersey  Natural  Heritage  Program  considers  this  species  to  be 
imperiled  in  New  Jersey  because  of  rarity.  The  tiger  salamander  has  avoided  localized 
extinction  because  it  has  the  ability  to  use  human-made  pools  for  breeding  ponds.  Surveys  of 
this  species  conducted  in  1995  revealed  that  the  tiger  salamander  occurred  at  only  a  limited 
number  of  sites  in  Atlantic  and  Cumberland  Counties  (CWFNJ  2012-TN3263).  The  eastern 
tiger  salamander  was  not  observed  on  the  site  or  in  the  vicinity  during  the  2009  to  2010  PSEG 
survey.  However,  tiger  salamanders  were  recorded  during  an  ecological  survey  conducted  on 
Artificial  Island  from  1972  through  1978  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Important  Habitats 

No  areas  on  the  PSEG  Site  are  Federally  designated  as  critical  habitat  for  any  Federally-listed 
threatened  or  endangered  species.  This  section  includes  important  wetlands,  wildlife 
sanctuaries,  refuges,  and  preserves. 

Wetlands 


Activities  including  the  discharge  of  dredge  or  fill  materials  into  waters  of  the  United  States, 
including  wetlands,  require  permit  authorization  from  the  USACE  under  Section  404  of  the  CWA 
(33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662).  Additionally,  the  USACE  regulates  any  work  or  structures 
affecting  navigable  waters  of  the  United  States,  including  wetlands,  under  Section  1 0  of  the 
Rivers  and  Harbors  Appropriation  Act  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  -TN660).  NJDEP  regulates  coastal 
wetlands  under  the  New  Jersey  Wetlands  Act  of  1 970  (NJSA  1 3:9A  et  seq.  -TN3361 ),  and 
freshwater  wetlands  are  regulated  under  the  New  Jersey  Freshwater  Wetlands  Protection  Act 
(NJAC  7:7A-TH4284)  (PSEG  2012-TN2389). 

PSEG  submitted  an  application  for  line  verification  to  NJDEP  for  the  PSEG  Site.  Additionally, 
PSEG  submitted  a  Jurisdictional  Determination  Request  to  the  USACE  to  clarify  the  USACE’s 
jurisdiction  on  the  USACE’s  85-ac  CDF  facility  immediately  north  of  the  PSEG  Site.  As  part  of 
its  request,  PSEG  submitted  results  of  jurisdictional  wetland  delineation  conducted  in

accordance  with  procedures  identified  in  the  Federal  Manual  for  Identifying  and  Delineating 
Jurisdictional  Wetlands  (USACE  et  al.  1989-TN4285)  and  Corps  of  Engineers  Wetland 
Delineation  Manual  (USACE  1987-TN2066)  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Freshwater  wetland  complexes 
were  identified,  flagged,  and  surveyed.  Hydrophytic  vegetation,  hydric  soils,  and  wetland 
hydrology  were  identified  and  described  at  each  of  the  data  collection  points.  Additionally, 

PSEG  submitted  a  description  of  the  85-ac  CDF  facility  along  with  interpretation  of  USACE 
Regulatory  Guidance  and  descriptions  of  the  CDF  hydrology,  hydrophytic  vegetation,  and  hydric 
soil  to  support  wetland  determination  (PSEG  2012-TN2389). 

A  total  of  39  Federal  jurisdictional  freshwater  wetland  units  covering  approximately  158.7  ac 
were  identified  by  the  USACE  in  a  letter  dated  February  24,  2014,  to  PSEG  (USACE  2014- 
TN3282).  These  areas  were  identified  as  Block  26,  lots  2,  4,  4.01,  5,  and  5.01  in  Lower 
Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  Any  proposal  to  perform  work,  build 
structures,  or  discharge  dredge  or  fill  material  into  the  identified  areas  would  require  prior 
approval  from  the  Philadelphia  District  USACE.  Figure  2-6  depicts  the  jurisdictional  wetlands 
(considered  important  terrestrial  habitat)  on  the  PSEG  Site.  The  printed  version  of  this  figure 
may  not  be  legible;  however,  the  electronic  version  is  viewable  when  zoomed  in.  Figure  2-6 
includes  wetlands  mapped  by  NJDEP  (coastal  wetlands)  and  those  delineated  on  the  site  as 
part  of  the  site  (USACE  CDF  facility,  PSEG  desilt  basin,  and  freshwater  wetlands).  A  total  of 
1 64.9  ac  of  coastal  wetlands  and  1 58.68  ac  of  freshwater  wetlands  have  been  mapped  on  the 
PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  USACE  2014-TN3282).  The  39  units  were  individually 
identified  as  Al,  AA,  B1,  BB,  CC,  CDF3,  D,  D1,  Dla,  Dlb,  Die,  Did,  DD,  E,  F,  FI,  G,  G1,  H, 

HI,  I,  II,  J,  K,  L,  N,  O,  01,  P,  Q,  R,  S,  T,  U,  V,  W,  X,  Y,  and  Z.  The  USACE  jurisdictional 
freshwater  wetlands  located  in  unit  CDF3  were  identified  during  a  site  investigation  on 
December  5,  2013.  The  remaining  USACE  jurisdictional  wetland  units  were  included  in  the 
NJDEP  line  verification  (USACE  2014-TN3282). 

Most  of  the  PSEG  Site  is  surrounded  by  tidal  marsh  dominated  by  near  monocultures  of  the 
invasive  common  reed.  This  is  also  the  case  for  most  of  the  tidal  marsh  surrounding  Hope 
Creek,  Alloway  Creek,  and  associated  smaller  marsh  creeks.  Most  of  the  coastal  wetlands 
occur  within  the  northern  portion  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  connect  to  the  contiguous  Alloway  Creek 
and  Hope  Creek  coastal  wetland  systems  (marshes)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  eastern  portion  of  the  PSEG  Site  contains  primarily  freshwater  wetlands  dominated  by 
monocultures  of  Phragmites.  They  are  predominantly  tidal  wetland  systems  that  are  contiguous 
with  coastal  wetlands  mapped  by  the  New  Jersey  Wetlands  Act  of  1970  (NJSA  13:9A  et  seq.  - 
TN3361 ).  Functionally,  these  wetlands  are  similar  to  the  coastal  wetlands  and  are  tidally 
influenced  systems.  Some  areas  on  Artificial  Island,  such  as  the  CDF  and  the  PSEG  Site  desilt 
basins,  have  been  diked  and  are  no  longer  tidally  influenced  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  PSEG  EEP  manages  the  ACW  Site  just  north  of  Alloway  Creek.  The  restoration  program 
has  successfully  restored  several  common  reed-dominated  wetlands  with  Spartina  alterniflora, 
Spartina  cynosuroides,  Spartina  patens ,  Persicaria  hydropiper ,  and  Sagittaria  la ti folia  as  part  of 
the  program  since  1995,  encompassing  an  area  of  more  than  14,550  ac  throughout  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  in  accordance  with  site-specific 
NJDEP-approved  management  plans.  Common  reed  communities  are  treated  using  herbicides, 
or  tidal  exchange  is  reestablished  that  allows  native  marsh  species  (e.g.,  saltmarsh  cordgrass)

to  repopulate  the  wetland  sites.  Monitoring  is  conducted  in  accordance  with  an  NJDEP 
approved  Improved  Biological  Monitoring  Work  Plan  program.  Each  site  is  monitored  yearly  to 
ensure  a  successful  restoration  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Restoration  programs  such  as  the 
Alloway  Creek  program  could  increase  the  functionality  of  degraded  wetlands. 

Wildlife  Sanctuaries,  Refuges,  and  Preserves 

There  are  numerous  wildlife  sanctuaries,  refuges,  and  preserves  within  the  Atlantic  Coastal 
Plains  Ecoregion.  In  Delaware,  portions  of  three  counties  within  the  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains 
Ecoregion  include  two  National  Wildlife  Refuges  (NWRs)  (Bombay  Hook  and  Prime  Hook,  with 
a  combined  25,978  ac)  and  12  state  parks  (totaling  7,469  ac).  New  Castle  County  in  Delaware 
has  1 1  state  parks  totaling  7,403  ac  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  Delaware  Wildlife  Action  Plan 
(DNREC  2006-TN2899)  identifies  Key  Wildlife  Habitats  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  These 
areas  are  identified  as  Key  Wildlife  Habitats  either  because  they  have  the  potential  to  support  a 
high  diversity  of  Species  of  Greatest  Conservation  Need  or  they  are  part  of  a  large 
complex/block  capable  of  supporting  an  array  of  plant  and  animal  species.  Key  Wildlife  Habitats 
documented  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site  include  chestnut  oak-hairgrass  forest,  early  successional 
habitats,  impoundments,  mixed  broadleaf  freshwater  tidal  marshes,  Spartina  high  salt  marshes, 
and  unvegetated  intertidal  mudflats  and  wetlands  (DNREC  2006-TN2899). 

Portions  of  seven  counties  in  Maryland  fall  within  the  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains  Ecoregion.  This 
area  includes  two  NWRs  (Susquehanna  and  Eastern  Neck),  one  national  trust,  three  private 
parks,  and  six  state  parks.  A  total  of  39,71 1  ac  of  recreational  lands  occur  in  these  seven 
Maryland  counties  (PSEG  2012-TN1489). 

New  Jersey  has  the  largest  land  area  within  the  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains  Ecoregion  dedicated  to 
recreational  use  (217,197  ac).  These  lands  include  two  NWRs  (Cape  May  and  Supawna 
Meadows),  which  together  total  15,600  ac.  Other  recreational  resources  in  New  Jersey  within 
the  50  mi  radius  include  three  land  trusts  (8,365  ac)  and  eight  state  parks  (193,231  ac).  The 
National  Park  Service  (NPS)  has  designated  a  300-mi-long  area  along  the  coastline  as  the  New 
Jersey  Coastal  Heritage  Trail  extending  from  Deepwater  on  the  Delaware  River  to  Raritan  Bay 
on  the  Atlantic  Ocean.  Within  the  four-county  region  in  New  Jersey,  Cumberland  County  has 
7,756  ac  committed  to  two  natural  land  trusts  (Glades  Wildlife  Refuge  and  Peak  Reserve). 

Salem  County  has  17,775  ac  that  are  mainly  associated  with  the  Supawna  Meadows  NWR 
(4,600  ac),  four  state  parks  (12,566  ac),  the  Burdon  Hill  Preserve  (609  ac),  Mad  Horse  Creek 
WMA  (9,498  ac),  and  Abbott  Meadows  (1,011  ac).  A  portion  of  the  Delsea  Region  of  the  New 
Jersey  Coastal  Heritage  Trail  is  located  in  Salem  and  Cumberland  Counties,  including  a 
welcome  center  at  Fort  Mott  State  Park  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Pennsylvania  has  the  lowest  amount  of  acreage  dedicated  to  recreational  land  within  the 
Atlantic  Coastal  Plains  Ecoregion.  For  the  eight  Pennsylvania  counties,  there  are  17,775  ac  of 
recreational  land  within  the  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains  Ecoregion.  This  includes  200  ac  of  the  John 
Heinz  NWR  at  Tinicum;  3,500  ac  at  Valley  Forge  National  Historical  Park;  9,718  ac  within 
six  state  parks;  and  4,357  ac  within  17  land  trusts  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Figure  2-7  in  Section  2.2  shows  WMAs  and  other  wildlife  areas  within  a  6-mi  radius  of  the  PSEG 
Site.  The  following  is  a  brief  discussion  of  those  areas:

Affected  Environment 


Cedar  Swamp  Wildlife  Area  (Delaware).  Cedar  Swamp  Wildlife  Area,  managed  by  the 
Delaware  Division  of  Fish  and  Wildlife,  consists  of  four  large  land  tracts  totaling  over  5,500  ac  of 
wilderness  near  Townsend,  Delaware,  and  the  mouth  of  Delaware  Bay.  The  site  offers  wildlife 
watching  and  hunting  opportunities,  including  waterfowl  hunting,  deer  hunting  (including 
categories  for  firearms,  archery,  and  disabled  hunters),  and  small  game  hunting  opportunities 
(EcoDelaware  2014-TN3265;  DNREC  2012-TN3264). 

Augustine  Wildlife  Area  (Delaware).  Augustine  Wildlife  Area  consists  of  four  large  land  tracts 
totaling  almost  2,700  ac  of  wilderness  near  Port  Penn  and  the  Delaware  River.  The  site 
contains  the  Port  Penn  Trail,  a  1-mi  path  that  winds  its  way  between  a  tidal  marsh  and  the 
Delaware  River.  This  trail  is  located  across  the  street  from  the  Port  Penn  Interpretive  Center, 
and  it  is  open  from  October  1  to  February  1 .  Near  the  trail  head  are  an  authentic  floating  cabin 
and  a  historic  muskrat-skinning  shack.  The  site  offers  wildlife  watching  along  with  a  number  of 
hunting  opportunities.  These  hunting  opportunities  include  waterfowl  hunting,  deer  hunting 
(including  categories  for  firearms,  archery,  and  disabled  hunters),  small  game  hunting,  and 
falconry  (EcoDelaware  2014-TN3266;  DNREC  2012-TN3267). 

Abbotts  Meadow  Wildlife  Management  Area  (New  Jersey).  Abbotts  Meadow  is  a  1,468-ac 
WMA  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  It  is  a  hotspot  for  viewing  birds  of  grasslands  and  early 
successional  habitats.  The  farm  fields,  marsh  edge  and  meadows,  and  hedgerows  that 
separate  them  provide  a  perfect  habitat  for  a  variety  of  species.  Baltimore  and  orchard  orioles 
are  often  seen  darting  through  the  hedgerows,  along  with  northern  cardinals  and  field  sparrows. 
In  the  winter  waterfowl  and  wading  birds  can  be  seen  in  the  marsh,  and  raptors  such  as 
northern  harriers  can  sometimes  be  seen.  Ospreys  are  common  during  late  spring  and 
summer,  while  bald  eagles  are  more  often  seen  during  the  colder  months.  Groundhogs  are 
commonly  seen  along  the  roads  and  fields  of  the  WMA.  Muskrat  dens  are  found  throughout  the 
marsh.  The  site  also  provides  hiking,  fishing  and  hunting  opportunities  (NJDEP  2012-TN3269). 

Mad  Horse  Creek  Wildlife  Management  Area  (New  Jersey).  The  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA  in 
Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  is  9,498  ac.  It  offers  opportunities  for  boating, 
saltwater  fishing,  hunting,  and  bird  watching  (waterfowl  and  other  birds).  The  area  has  foraging 
and  nesting  habitat  for  bald  eagles,  ospreys,  and  great  blue  herons.  There  is  parking  as  well  as 
a  boat  ramp  at  the  end  of  Stowneck  Road.  The  area  contains  both  tidal  marsh  and  upland 
habitat  (PSEG  2012-TN1489;  OTWNJ  2012-TN3270). 

Important  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Species  and  Habitats — Existing  Transmission  Lines 

Important  Species.  Important  species  having  the  potential  to  occur  in  the  existing  transmission 
line  corridors  are  similar  to  those  species  that  could  potentially  occur  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  in 
the  6-mi  vicinity  as  described  above.  Federally  and  State-listed  species  in  transmission  line 
ROWs  are  the  same  species  as  listed  above. 

Important  Habitats.  Important  habitats  having  the  potential  to  occur  in  the  existing  transmission 
line  corridors  and  access  road  are  similar  to  those  habitats  that  occur  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  in 
the  6-mi  vicinity  as  described  above.  The  existing  transmission  ROWs  servicing  HOGS  and 
SGS  are  not  known  to  extend  through  Federally  designated  critical  habitat.  However,  wetland

habitats  exist  along  their  route.  In  addition  to  important  wetland  habitat,  existing  transmission 
ROWs  are  routed  through  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA  and  Abbotts  Meadow  WMA. 

2. 4. 1.4  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Monitoring 

PSEG  conducts  vegetation  cover  and  geomorphology  monitoring  as  part  of  its  EEP.  This 
program  has  been  ongoing  since  1995  and  includes  four  wetland  restoration  sites  and  two 
reference  sites.  The  objective  of  these  programs  is  to  restore  Phragmites  dominated 
communities  with  native  marsh  species.  The  biological  monitoring  program  is  conducted 
subject  to  an  NJDEP  approved  work  plan  and  each  site  is  monitored  yearly  to  evaluate  the 
success  of  the  restoration  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

2.4.2  Aquatic  Ecology 

This  section  describes  the  aquatic  environments  and  their  associated  biological  resources  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  that  could  be  affected  by  building,  operating,  or  maintaining  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  site.  It  describes  the  spatial  and  temporal  distribution,  abundance, 
life  history  stages,  and  attributes  of  biotic  assemblages  that  could  be  affected  by  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  and  identifies  “important”  or  irreplaceable  aquatic  natural 
resources  that  could  be  affected.  The  surface-water  hydrology  and  water  quality  that  support 
these  aquatic  resources  in  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  are  described  in  Section  2.3. 

The  principal  aquatic  systems  that  could  be  affected  include  the  onsite  artificial  lakes  and  small 
marsh  creeks,  the  extensive  area  of  marsh  creeks  north  of  the  PSEG  Site  where  the  proposed 
causeway  would  be  constructed,  and  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

2. 4.2. 7  Aquatic  Resources  of  the  Site  and  Vicinity 

Artificial  Lakes  and  Onsite  Small  Marsh  Creeks 

Aquatic  systems  in  the  PSEG  Site  vicinity  include  small  artificial  lakes,  as  described  in 
Table  2-1,  that  are  within  dredged  material  containment  berms  (desilt  basins)  and  wetland 
ecosystems — including  their  extensive  network  of  interconnected  marsh  creeks.  The  desilt 
basins  are  located  in  the  northwestern  area  of  the  existing  PSEG  Site  and  have  a  variable 
combined  surface  area  that  depends  on  use  and  operation  of  the  basins  for  dredge  disposal 
operations  (identified  as  open  water/pond  in  Figure  2-21).  The  desilt  basins  function  as  perched 
water  bodies  hydrologically  isolated  from  the  adjacent  coastal  wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
Aquatic  habitats  associated  with  the  desilt  basins  are  considered  poor  for  sustaining  balanced 
indigenous  biotic  communities  because  they  are  shallow;  have  silt  and  sand  substrates;  and  lack 
adequate  physical  structure,  nutrient  regimes,  and  hydrodynamic  flow  for  maintaining  high  levels  of 
in  situ  biological  productivity  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  These  human-made  systems  are  part  of  the 
USACE  CDF  facility  and  PSEG's  active,  licensed  desilt  basin  and  not  hydrologically  connected  to 
the  Delaware  River  or  tidally  influenced;  therefore,  they  are  transitory  and  subject  to  use  as  disposal 
areas  for  material  dredged  as  part  of  ongoing  maintenance  activities.

Affected  Environment 


The  biological  communities  of  these  desilt  basins  and  onsite  small  marsh  creeks  consist 
primarily  of  benthic  invertebrates  and  fish  communities,  and  are  listed  by  species  in  Tables  2-9 
and  2-10,  respectively.  Fish  were  collected  from  small  onsite  creeks  using  weirs  and  seines  set 
at  high  tide  and  retrieved  at  low  tide.  Recent  sampling  in  2009  showed  that  diversity  and 
standing  stock  biomass  of  the  fish  community  is  relatively  low,  with  six  to  seven  species  typically 
dominating  during  most  seasons  of  the  year  (PSEG  201 3-TN2586).  Basically,  four  levels  of  the 
food  chain  are  represented  in  these  basins,  including  (1)  small  fish  that  are  considered  top- 
water  insectivores  (Sheepshead  Minnow,  Cyprinodon  variegatus;  Banded  Killifish,  Fundulus 
diaphanus;  and  Mummichog,  F.  heteroclitus );  (2)  detritivores/bottom  feeders  represented  by 
Common  Carp  ( Cyprinus  carpio)\  (3)  omnivores  represented  by  Pumpkinseed  ( Lepomis 
gibbosus )  and  Bluegill  ( L .  macrochirus)\  planktivores  represented  by  Inland  Silverside  ( Menidia 
beryllina)',  and  (4)  piscivores  represented  by  Largemouth  Bass  (Micropterus  salmoides). 

Relative  abundance  of  fish  in  these  systems  is  higher  in  the  spring  and  summer,  reflecting 
recruitment  of  young-of-the-year  into  the  populations  during  these  periods. 

Macroinvertebrates  were  sampled  using  a  ponar  dredge  in  onsite  desilt  basins,  onsite  small 
marsh  creeks,  offsite  large  marsh  creeks,  and  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  PSEG 
shoreline  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Assessment  of  the  macroinvertebrate  community  in  2009  also 
displayed  low  diversity  of  the  benthic  macroinvertebrates  in  these  desilt  basins,  with  primarily 
only  two  phyla,  the  annelids  and  the  arthropods,  being  represented  as  shown  in  Table  2-9 
(PSEG  2013-TN2586).  The  oligochaete  worms  in  the  family  Tubificidae  ( Limnodrilus  spp.)  and 
one  insect  genus,  the  non-biting  midge  (i.e. ,  Chironomus),  are  the  dominant  organisms  in  terms 
of  biomass  and  relative  abundance  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  most  abundant  invertebrate 
species  in  the  benthic  community  of  the  smaller  marsh  creeks  are  oligochaetes  ( Limnodrilus 
and  other  tubificids)  and  amphipods  ( Gammarus  daiberi and  Leptocheirus  sp.)  (PSEG  2013- 
TN2586).  The  low  diversity,  biomass,  and  abundance  of  the  macroinvertebrate  community  in 
these  desilt  basins  are  probably  major  regulators  of  the  structure  and  function  of  the  fish 
communities  because  these  food  sources  provide  relatively  poor  bioenergetic  and  nutritive 
value. 

Marsh  Creek  Drainages 

The  onsite  interconnected  system  of  marsh  creeks  is  represented  by  four  major  drainages 
including  Mill  Creek,  Alloway  Creek,  Fishing  Creek,  and  Hope  Creek  along  with  a  large  number 
of  small  to  medium  size  interconnected  streams  throughout  the  area  north  and  east  of  the 
existing  PSEG  Site  (Figure  2-21 ).  All  but  the  most  upstream  intermittent  segments  of  these 
streams  are  tidally  influenced  because  of  their  hydrologic  connection  to  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  (PDE  2012-TN2191).  Physicochemical  conditions  such  as  salinity  and  temperature  can 
fluctuate  rather  widely  in  these  streams  over  periods  of  hours  or  weeks,  depending  upon 
climatic  conditions,  freshwater  discharge  at  the  headwaters,  and  tidal  height  and  influence. 
Typically,  in  the  upper  reaches  of  these  streams,  salinity  conditions  are  considered  oligohaline 
(salinity  range  from  0.5  to  5  ppt)  while  the  lower  reaches,  which  are  more  tidally  influenced,  are 
classified  as  mesohaline  (salinity  range  of  5  to  18  ppt)  (PSEG  2013-TN2586).  The  spatial 
gradients  along  the  streams  of  physicochemical  factors  (salinity,  temperature,  dissolved  oxygen, 
nutrients)  influence  the  composition,  productivity,  relative  abundance,  and  spatial  distribution  of 
the  resident  biological  communities.

Fish  communities  were  sampled  in  small  and  large  reference  creek  habitats  and  in  habitats  that 
were  restored  by  PSEG.  Monthly  sampling  between  May  and  November  was  achieved  using 
otter  trawls  in  large  marsh  creeks  and  weir  sampling  in  small  marsh  creeks  (PSEG  2004- 
TN2565).  The  marsh  creek  segments  in  the  lower  bay  included  Dennis  Township,  Commercial 
Township,  and  Moores  Beach,  and  upper  bay  sites  included  Browns  Run,  Mill  Creek,  Mad 
Horse  Creek,  and  Alloway  Creek  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  marsh  creeks  nearest  the  PSEG  Site  are  Mill  Creek,  Alloway  Creek,  and  Mad  Horse  Creek, 
and  they  show  different  fish  assemblages  between  2003  and  2010  from  those  sampled  in  the 
small  PSEG  desilt  basins  and  onsite  drainage  creeks  (Table  2-10).  Mad  Horse  Creek  occurs  to 
the  south  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  is  not  depicted  on  Figure  2-21 . 

The  smaller  segments  of  the  nearest  marsh  creek  systems  were  dominated  in  all  seasons  by 
the  Mummichog,  with  both  Atlantic  Silverside  ( Menidia  menidia )  and  Bay  Anchovy  ( Anchoa 
mitchilli)  also  being  present  on  a  consistent  basis  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566; 
PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513; 

PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ).  The  Mummichog  is  typically  found  in  tidal  creek 
systems  from  New  England  to  the  South  Atlantic  coast  and  is  characterized  by  having  a 
relatively  high  physiological  tolerance  to  varying  physicochemical  factors  and  also  displaying 
high  site  fidelity  and  residing  all  or  most  of  their  lives  in  tidal  creek  systems  (Sweeney  et 
al.  1998-TN2205).  As  is  typical  of  most  small  marsh  creek  systems,  fish  community  diversity  is 
low,  varying  from  one  to  five  species  depending  on  the  season,  and  fish  biomass  is  almost 
always  dominated  by  one  or  two  species.

NUREG-2168 


Affected  Environment 


The  fish  collection  data  of  the  larger  marsh  creek  segments  are  shown  in  Table  2-10  and  are 
composed  of  a  higher  total  number  and  diversity  of  species  between  2003  and  2010  than  the 
small  marsh  creek  segments.  Several  of  these  species  normally  are  associated  with  tidal 
estuaries  and  higher  salinity  regimes.  The  most  consistently  abundant  species  present  in  these 
larger  creek  segments  are  the  Bay  Anchovy,  Atlantic  Menhaden  ( Brevoortia  tyrannus ),  and 
White  Perch  ( Morone  americana ).  Other  species  that  are  generally  common  and  occasionally 
abundant  include  the  Weakfish  ( Cynoscion  regalis),  Striped  Bass  ( Morone  saxatilis),  Hogchoker 
( Trinectes  maculatus),  Atlantic  Silverside,  Atlantic  Croaker  ( Micropogonias  undulatus ),  and  Spot 
( Leiostomus  xanthurus).  Several  of  these  estuarine-associated  species  such  as  juvenile 
Atlantic  Menhaden,  Weakfish,  and  Atlantic  Croaker  use  the  larger  marsh  creek  segments  as 
feeding  and  nursery  areas  before  migrating  back  to  higher  salinity  and  more  open  waters  as 
more  developed  juveniles  or  adults  (MDNR  2013-TN2156). 

However,  as  with  the  macroinvertebrate  communities  in  the  desilt  basins  and  small  marsh 
creeks,  diversity  in  these  larger  marsh  creeks  is  also  low  (see  Table  2-9).  Amphipods  are  the 
most  dominant  group  of  invertebrates,  being  represented  by  Corophium  sp.  and  Gammarus 
daiberi {PSEG  2013-TN2586). 

Delaware  River  Estuary 

The  Delaware  River  and  Delaware  Bay  are  a  part  of  the  larger  Delaware  Estuary  and  River 
Basin  that  extends  from  headwaters  in  New  York  State  to  the  coastal  plains  near  Cape 
Henlopen  in  Delaware  (PDE  2012-TN2191 ).  The  Delaware  Bay  extends  from  the  confluence  of 
the  Delaware  River  with  the  Atlantic  Ocean  from  Delaware  River  Kilometer  (RKM)  0  to  RKM  87 
[RM  0  to  RM  54],  The  Delaware  River  Estuary  includes  the  Delaware  Bay  and  extends  up  the 
tidal  Delaware  River,  which  is  characterized  by  brackish  water  between  Delaware  RKM  87  and 
RKM  129  (RM  54  to  RM  80)  and  becomes  freshwater  at  Delaware  RKM  129  (RM  80)  (BBL  and 
Integral  2007-TN21 26).  The  PSEG  Site  near  the  mouth  of  Alloway  Creek  is  at  Delaware  RKM 
84  (RM  52)  (DRBC  201 1-TN2412)  and  is  considered  to  be  in  the  lower  estuary  watershed  unit 
of  the  Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin  (PDE  201 2-TN21 91 ).  Characterization  of  the  region 
dates  back  to  pre-Revolutionary  War  times  when  shipping  and  trading  at  developing  ports  from 
the  mouth  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  to  inland  Delaware,  Pennsylvania,  and  New  Jersey 
increased  use  of  the  watershed  (Berger  et  al.  1994-TN2127).  Increasing  urbanization  and 
industrialization  of  the  region  from  1840  to  present  day  have  significantly  contributed  to  the 
degradation  of  the  watershed  with  habitat  alteration,  water  diversion,  and  increased  pollution  of 
the  Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin  ecosystems  as  no  environmental  policies  were 
established  until  the  1960s  and  later  (Berger  et  al.  1994-TN2127).  According  to  the  most  recent 
status  report  on  the  Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin,  the  region  continues  to  see  some 
decline  in  environmental  health  indicators  such  as  removal  of  estuary  sediments  and  increases 
in  nitrogen  and  contaminant  levels.  However,  environmental  conditions  such  as  technology 
implementation  to  increase  fish  passage  and  restoration  of  targeted  aquatic  habitats  have 
improved  the  aquatic  ecology  for  the  watershed  (PDE  201 2-TN21 91 ).  The  DRBC  stated  in  the 
State  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  report  for  2013  that  increases  in  temperature  and  salinity  are 
expected  with  future  sea-level  rise  and  climate  change  over  a  period  of  time  in  the  future 
(DRBC  2013-TN2609).  The  DRBC  conclusion  is  supported  by  the  U.S.  Global  Change 
Research  Program  regarding  the  very  high  likelihood  that  sea  levels  will  rise  and  create  different 
environmental  conditions  within  this  century  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).  Because  the  Delaware

Affected  Environment 


River  Estuary  near  the  PSEG  Site  is  already  a  zone  of  tidally  influenced  fluctuation  with  variable 
salinity  and  temperature,  these  potential  changes  are  likely  to  result  in  movement  of  populations 
of  marine  and  euryhaline  species  farther  up  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

The  biological  communities  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in  the  area  of  the  PSEG  Site  are 
typical  of  those  that  exist  all  along  the  main  reaches  of  the  Delaware  Bay  system.  To  mitigate 
egg  and  larval  fish  loss  through  the  cooling  system  for  SGS.  PSEG  proposed  and  established 
an  estuary  enhancement  program  (EEP)  to  restore  salt  marshes  and  provide  monitoring  and 
other  structural  enhancements  to  mitigate  losses  of  aquatic  species  through  impingement  and 
entrainment  at  SGS  (Balletto  and  Teal  201 1-TN2612).  The  EEP  established  an  ongoing 
biological  monitoring  program,  in  addition  to  habitat  restoration,  to  track  the  success  of  the 
mitigation  actions.  Because  of  the  biological  monitoring  surveys  that  have  been  conducted  in 
this  area  of  the  Delaware  Bay  since  the  mid-1980s  in  support  of  the  environmental  requirements 
for  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  SGS  and  the  HCGS.  an  extensive  long-term  data  set 
exists  on  the  fishery  and  benthic  macroinvertebrate  communities  of  this  area. 

Submerged  aquatic  vegetation  has  not  historically  been  observed  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary 
near  the  PSEG  Site  primarily  because  of  the  high  levels  of  turbidity  (Miller  et  al.  2012-TN2686), 
and  submerged  aquatic  vegetation  was  not  observed  in  the  sampling  areas  near  the  PSEG  Site 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Biological  monitoring  and  characterization  of  the  fish  communities  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  and  near  the  PSEG  Site  are  based  on  trawling  and  seining  surveys  which  have  been 
conducted  annually  for  several  years  and  also  on  power  plant  impingement  and  entrainment 
data  sets  for  SGS  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG 
2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011- 
TN2571 ).  Table  2-1 1  lists  the  diversity  of  species  from  the  combined  trawling  and  seining 
sampling  efforts  between  2003  and  2010  for  the  entire  Delaware  River  Estuary  region  from 
RKM  0  to  RKM  117  (RM  0  to  RM  72.7)  and  for  sampling  zone  7  (nearest  the  PSEG  Site)  from 
RKM  80  to  RKM  100  (RM  49.7  to  RM  62.1).  Species  collected  from  seining  efforts  are  listed 
only  as  being  present.  Bottom  trawls  using  a  semi-balloon  otter  trawl  were  used  to  collect 
samples  once  per  month  from  April  through  November  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005- 
TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009- 
TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ).  and  between  2003  and  2004,  pelagic 
trawl  studies  were  also  conducted  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566).  Seining  was 
performed  twice  a  month  between  July  and  October  and  once  per  month  in  June  and  November 
using  a  100  ft  long  by  6  ft  deep  bagged  haul  seine  (PSEG  2004-TN2565:  PSEG  2005-TN2566; 
PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG 
2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Trawling  and  seining  species  abundance  and  diversity  reflect  the  variable  salinity  levels  with  the 
lower  bay  zones  near  the  mouth  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  showing  the  highest  salinity 
levels  and  the  salinity  gradually  decreasing  through  the  mid-bay  zone  to  the  upper-bay  zones 
near  the  PSEG  Site  (see  Figure  2-22).  Predominantly  marine  species  and  anadromous  species 
dominated  the  mouth  of  the  bay  with  a  transition  to  more  euryhaline  species  in  the  mid-  and 
upper-bay  zones.  Trawling  and  seining  surveys  in  2003  and  2004  examined  zones  further 
upriver  from  the  upper  bay  zones  and  collected  primarily  freshwater  and  anadromous  species 
(PSEG  2004-TN2565:  PSEG  2005-TN2566).

TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011-TN2571. 


Based  on  the  most  recent  8  years  of  trawling  and  seining  surveys,  the  species  richness  of  the 
fish  community  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  upper  bay  sampling  zone  7  and  seining  sites 
between  RKM  80  and  RKM  100  (RM  49.7  and  RM  62.1)  near  the  PSEG  Site  was  relatively  high, 
with  over  30  different  species  over  the  8-year  span  representing  a  variety  of  freshwater,  marine, 
and  anadromous  species  (see  Table  2-11). 

Over  the  8-year  data  collection  period,  the  dominant  species  near  the  PSEG  Site  were 
Hogchoker,  Bay  Anchovy,  Atlantic  Croaker,  Weakfish,  White  Perch,  and  Hickory  Shad  ( Alosa 
mediocris),  while  other  commonly  abundant  species  included  Striped  Bass  and  American  Eel 
{Anguilla  rostrata). 

As  mentioned  previously,  additional  sampling  studies  include  the  impingement  and  entrainment 
studies  at  SGS  between  1986  and  1987  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572)  and  2003  to 
2010  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568; 
PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011-TN2571;  PSEG 
2015-TN4280).  An  additional  impingement  study  was  performed  between  1986  and  1987  for 
HCGS  (VJSA  1 988-TN2564;  ECS  1 989-TN2572).  Results  of  8  years  of  SGS  impingement 
studies  between  2003  and  2010  confirm  the  diversity  and  composition  of  the  fish  communities  in 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  PSEG  Site  are  similar  to  those  demonstrated  by  the 
trawling  and  seining  results  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567; 
PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG 
201 1-TN2571 ).  Small  differences  in  species  composition  between  surveys  based  on  active 
(i.e.,  trawling,  seining)  and  passive  (i.e. ,  impingement)  collection  methods  could  be  due  to  a 
combination  of  factors  such  as  sampling  methodology,  gear  types,  and  location  and  orientation 
of  intake  structures  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

common  in  bay  and  river  habitats  along  the  Atlantic  coast  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Summer 
samples  were  numerically  dominated  by  Weakfish,  which  averaged  over  50  percent  of  the  total 
collection  period  between  2003  and  2010  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566; 

PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513; 

PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ).  Other  relatively  common  species  that  displayed 
variations  in  seasonal  abundance  were  Atlantic  Croaker  and  Blueback  Herring  ( Alosa  aestivalis ) 
(most  abundant  in  winter),  Bay  Anchovy  (spring),  and  Striped  Bass  (summer  and  fall).  Based 
on  the  impingement  collections  from  both  SGS  and  HCGS,  there  are  no  evident  long-term 
temporal  patterns  in  either  fish  community  richness  or  abundance,  although  specific  species 
such  as  White  Perch  have  increased  in  abundance  in  impingement  sampling  at  SGS  between 
the  mid-1980s  and  the  2000s,  while  Bay  Anchovy  has  decreased  (PSEG  2004-TN2565; 

PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569; 

PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ;  VJSA  1988-TN2564; 

ECS  1989-TN2572;  PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Ichthyoplankton  diversity  was  characterized  most  recently  in  2003  and  2004  (PSEG  2004- 
TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566).  Nocturnal  sampling  was  conducted  twice  a  month  between 
April  and  July  using  a  1 .0-m  diameter,  500-pm  mesh  plankton  net  that  was  towed  over  1 0-ft 
depth  intervals.  Samples  were  sorted  and  identified  to  the  lowest  taxon  level  practical.  In  the 
sampling  zone  nearest  the  PSEG  Site,  post-yolk  sac  larval  Striped  Bass,  Weakfish  eggs, 
and  Bay  Anchovy  eggs  were  the  most  abundant  species  and  life  stages  collected  over  the 
2-year  period  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566). 

The  benthic  macroinvertebrate  community  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  PSEG  Site 
was  characterized  during  two  periods,  1971  to  1976,  and  again  during  the  spring  and  fall  of 
2009,  as  shown  in  Table  2-9  (Connelly  et  al.  1977-TN2588;  PSEG  2013-TN2586).  The 
composition  and  species  richness  of  the  macroinvertebrate  community  in  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  near  the  site  is  similar  to  those  benthic  communities  in  other  areas  of  the  Delaware  Bay 
within  several  miles  of  the  site.  A  total  of  19  invertebrate  taxa  were  identified  during  the  2009 
sampling  period  by  ponar  dredge,  but  only  a  few  species  dominated  the  composition  of  the 
benthic  community  in  numerical  abundance  and  standing  crop  biomass.  These  species 
included  polychaetes,  amphipods,  and  isopods  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2013-TN2586). 

2. 4. 2. 2  Aquatic  Resources — Offsite  Areas 

Four  existing  500-kV  transmission  lines  within  three  existing  transmission  corridors  convey 
power  from  SGS  and  HCGS.  The  existing  102  mi  of  transmission  corridors  cross  Salem, 
Gloucester,  and  Camden  Counties  in  New  Jersey,  and  New  Castle  County  in  Delaware  (PSEG 
2015-TN4280).  The  Delaware  River  Estuary  is  the  only  major  water  body  crossed  by 
transmission  lines  as  described  in  Section  2.2.2. 1. 

The  proposed  causeway  would  be  built  in  the  area  of  numerous  medium-  to  large-sized  marsh 
creek  segments  directly  north  and  east  of  the  PSEG  Site.

2. 4. 2. 3  Important  A  qua  tic  Species  and  Habitats 

Important  species  include  those  that  are  commercially  and  recreationally  important  species; 
Federally  listed  threatened,  endangered,  or  candidate  species;  and  those  species  listed  by  the 
States  of  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  as  threatened,  endangered,  or  of  special  concern  that 
could  be  affected  by  building,  operating,  or  maintaining  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site.  Species  essential  to  the  maintenance  or  survival  of  the  above  species  or  critical  to  the 
structure  and  function  of  the  aquatic  ecosystem  are  also  included. 

Important  aquatic  habitats  include  wildlife  sanctuaries,  refuges  and  preserves,  critical  habitats 
for  listed  species,  and  essential  fish  habitat. 

Commercially  and  Recreationally  Important  Species 

In  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  PSEG  Site  vicinity,  21  species  offish  are  considered  as 
being  commercially  or  recreationally  important  in  New  Jersey  or  Delaware.  In  addition  to  these 
fish  species,  five  species  of  invertebrates  occurring  in  the  region  are  commercially  harvested  in 
New  Jersey  and  Delaware:  blue  crab  ( Callinectes  sapidus),  eastern  oyster  ( Crassostrea 
virginica),  knobbed  whelk  ( Busycon  carica),  channeled  whelk  ( Busycotypus  canaliculatus),  and 
northern  quahog  clam  ( Mercenaria  mercenaria)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  A  sixth  invertebrate 
species,  the  horseshoe  crab  ( Limulus  polyphemus),  is  harvested  in  Delaware.  Since  2008  there 
has  been  a  moratorium  in  place  on  the  harvest  of  horseshoe  crabs  in  New  Jersey 
(ASMFC  2014-TN351 1 ). 

American  Eel 


The  American  Eel  ( Anguilla  rostrata)  is  a  catadromous  species  that  spawns  in  the  Sargasso 
Sea  and  migrates  to  fresh  inland  waters  as  juveniles  and  young  adults.  Females  continue 
migration  upstream  to  freshwater  habitats  that  are  highly  oxygenated  and  provide  sufficient  food 
resources.  Males  tend  to  stay  in  brackish,  estuarine  waters.  Migration  for  reproductively  active 
adults  begins  in  the  fall,  and  spawning  occurs  in  midwinter  (FWS  201 1-TN2145).  The  American 
Eel  prefers  soft  mud  or  sand  substrates  and  is  widespread  throughout  the  mid-Atlantic  in 
estuaries,  rivers,  creeks,  lakes,  and  ponds.  Commercial  harvests  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware 
totaled  129,065  lb  and  90,631  lb,  respectively,  in  201 1  (NOAA  2013-TN2174).  Recreational 
harvests  in  201 1  totaled  31 ,898  individuals  in  New  Jersey  and  1 5,313  in  Delaware 
(NOAA  2013-TN2175). 

In  201 1 ,  the  FWS  issued  a  90-day  finding  on  a  petition  to  consider  listing  the  American  Eel  as  a 
threatened  species  under  the  Endangered  Species  Act  (16  USC  1531  et  seq.  -TNI 010)  and

American  Shad 


The  American  Shad  ( Alosa  sapidissima)  is  an  anadromous  fish  that  spends  most  of  its  adult  life 
in  the  open  ocean,  returning  to  natal  freshwater  streams  for  spawning  activities.  The  spawning 
season  begins  in  March  and  ends  in  May,  and  the  young  migrate  downriver  to  estuary  habitat 
following  hatching  where  they  wait  for  water  temperatures  to  begin  to  decrease  before  moving 
offshore  (Rohde  et  al.  1994-TN2208).  American  Shad  complete  adulthood  development  in  the 
ocean  where  they  feed  on  plankton,  small  crustaceans,  and  small  fish.  Adults  return  to  natal 
freshwater  sources  to  spawn  between  4  and  6  years  of  age  (DRBC  201 1-TN2140).  Commercial 
harvests  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  totaled  1,886  lb  and  8,967  lb,  respectively,  in  2011 
(NOAA  2013-TN2174). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  American  Shad  are 
commonly  found  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  in  the  large 
marsh  creeks  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-

Atlantic  Croaker 


The  Atlantic  Croaker  ( Micropogonias  undulatus )  is  a  member  of  the  drum  family  (Sciaenidae) 
and  is  caught  both  commercially  and  for  sport.  The  Atlantic  Croaker  ranges  along  the  Atlantic 
coast  and  Gulf  of  Mexico  waters  and  estuaries  characterized  by  muddy  and  sandy  mud  bottoms 
(MDNR  201 3-TN21 56).  The  Atlantic  Croaker  spawns  over  the  continental  shelf  over  a 
protracted  spawning  season  starting  in  early  July  and  extending  to  March  in  warmer  waters 
(Miller  et  al.  2003-TN2613).  Larvae  drift  into  coastal  estuaries  and  mature  to  feed  on  small 
crustaceans,  polychaete  worms,  and  mollusks  (MDNR  2013-TN2156).  Commercial  harvests  in 
New  Jersey  and  Delaware  totaled  465,1 17  lb  and  1 1 ,346  lb,  respectively,  in  201 1  (NOAA  2013- 
TN2174).  Recreational  harvests  in  201 1  totaled  203,324  individuals  in  New  Jersey  and  277,222 
in  Delaware  (NOAA  2013-TN2175). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  Atlantic  Croaker  are  one 
of  the  most  abundant  finfish  species  caught  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  near  the  PSEG 
Site  and  were  also  observed  in  the  offsite  small  and  large  marsh  creeks  near  the  PSEG  Site

Atlantic  Menhaden 


The  Atlantic  Menhaden  ( Brevoortia  tyrannus)  is  a  marine  fish  harvested  extensively  in  the 
United  States  for  use  as  a  bait  fish  and  for  nutrient  value  (NOAA  2012-TN2176).  Atlantic 
Menhaden  are  found  in  coastal  and  estuarine  waters  along  the  Atlantic  coast.  Spawning  occurs 
in  continental  shelf  waters  between  March  and  May  and  again  between  September  and  October 
(NOAA  2012-TN2176).  Larvae  mature  to  juveniles  in  estuarine  habitats,  and  then  migrate  in 
schools  to  marine  waters  while  filter-feeding  on  zooplankton  and  phytoplankton  (NOAA  2012- 
TN2176).  Commercial  harvests  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  totaled  74,324,485  lb  and 
64,566  lb,  respectively,  in  2011  (NOAA  2013-TN2174). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  observed  consistent  abundance  of 
Atlantic  Menhaden  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  in  the  onsite  small

Black  Drum 


Black  Drum  ( Pogonias  cromis)  is  a  long-lived  fish  that  ranges  along  the  western  Atlantic  coasts 
of  North  and  South  America  and  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  (Sutter  et  al.  1 986-TN2206).  Black  Drum  is 
a  bottom  feeder  that  feeds  on  small  crustaceans,  marine  worms,  and  small  fishes  found  in 
sandy  or  soft  bottom  habitats  in  estuaries  and  coastal  rivers  (Jones  and  Wells  1998-TN2212). 
Adults  move  inshore  to  spawn  in  the  spring  and  overwinter  offshore.  Juveniles  occupy  tidal 
creeks  and  salt  marsh  habitats  (Jones  and  Wells  1998-TN2212).  Black  Drum  is  an  important 
species  in  terms  of  commercial  and  recreational  fisheries  and  is  a  valued  food  fish.  Commercial 
harvests  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  totaled  3,130  lb  and  49,604  lb,  respectively,  in  201 1 
(NOAA  2013-TN2174).  Recreational  harvests  in  2011  totaled  25,244  individuals  in  New  Jersey 
and  936  in  Delaware  (NOAA  2013-TN2175). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  found  Black  Drum  in  Delaware 
River  Estuary  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  in  the  offsite  small  and  large  marsh  creeks  near

Black  Sea  Bass 


The  Black  Sea  Bass  ( Centropristis  striata)  is  a  member  of  the  sea  bass  family  (Serranidae)  and 
has  an  unusual  life  history.  Black  Sea  Bass  start  out  as  females  with  full  reproductive  capability 
and  then  switch  to  become  fertile  males  sometime  around  6  years  of  age.  Off  coastal  New 
Jersey,  spawning  occurs  between  May  and  June.  Adults  overwinter  in  deep  offshore  waters 
and  move  inshore  in  the  spring.  Both  juveniles  and  adults  feed  on  benthic  invertebrates  such  as 
crustaceans  and  squid  (MDMF  2006-TN2159).  Black  Sea  Bass  are  highly  valued  by  both 
commercial  and  recreational  fishermen  throughout  the  mid-Atlantic  as  a  food  fish.  Commercial 
harvests  of  Black  Sea  Bass  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  totaled  293,609  lb  and  3,524  lb, 
respectively,  in  2011  (NOAA  2013-TN2174).  Recreational  harvests  in  2011  totaled 
1,568,503  individuals  in  New  Jersey  and  326,358  in  Delaware  (NOAA  2013-TN2175). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  Black  Sea  Bass  are  more 
commonly  abundant  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  to  the  south  of  the  PSEG  Site.  A  single 
fish  was  collected  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site,  and  none  were

Bluefish 


The  Bluefish  ( Pomatomus  saltatrix)  is  found  worldwide  in  both  tropical  and  temperate  waters. 
Bluefish  are  found  in  schools  along  both  inshore  and  offshore  habitats  characterized  by  high 
energy  wave  action,  estuaries,  or  brackish  waters  (MDMF  2006-TN2160).  Along  the  Atlantic 
coast,  Bluefish  spawn  between  June  and  August  offshore  over  the  continental  shelf. 

Juveniles  remain  offshore  and  feed  on  crustaceans,  small  fish,  and  mollusks  (MDMF  2006- 
TN2160).  Adults  form  large  schools  and  migrate  along  coastal  waters  while  feeding  on 
fish,  crustaceans,  and  cephalopods.  Bluefish  are  fished  commercially  but  are  a  popular 
recreational  species  because  of  their  abundance,  flavor,  and  reputation  as  a  sport  fish 
(Pottern  et  al.  1989-TN2193).  Commercial  harvests  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  totaled 
709,418  lb  and  10,449  lb,  respectively,  in  201 1  (NOAA  201 3-TN2174).  Recreational  harvests  in 
201 1  totaled  3,448,169  individuals  in  New  Jersey  and  240,574  in  Delaware  (NOAA  2013- 
TN2175). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  found  Bluefish  commonly  abundant 
in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  south  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  less  abundant  in  Delaware  River

The  Butterdish  ( Peprilus  triacanthus)  is  a  forage  fish  for  other  fish  species  such  as  Silver  Hake 
( Merluccius  bilinearis),  Bluefish,  and  Swordfish  ( Xiphias  gladius).  Butterdish  range  along  the 
Atlantic  coast  from  Newfoundland  southward  to  eastern  Florida  and  the  Gulf  of  Mexico. 
Butterdish  migrate  in  schools  to  inshore  habitats  in  the  summer  and  offshore  in  the  winter 
(Overholtz  2006-TN21 89).  Spawning  occurs  offshore  from  May  through  October.  Adults  feed 
mainly  on  jellyfish,  squids,  marine  worms,  and  crustaceans  (Overholtz  2006-TN2189). 
Commercial  harvests  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  totaled  64,717  lb  and  101  lb,  respectively,  in

Channel  Catfish 


The  Channel  Catfish  ( Ictalurus  punctatus )  is  a  freshwater  species  that  is  also  commonly  found 
in  estuarine  waters  (MDNR  2013-TN2157).  In  New  Jersey,  the  Channel  Catfish  inhabits  clear, 
warm  lakes  and  moderate  to  large  rivers  characterized  by  clean  sand,  gravel,  or  rock/rubble 
substrate  (NJDEP  2013-TN2187).  Spawning  occurs  in  late  spring  when  females  lay  eggs  in 
nest  sites  along  depressions,  crevices,  or  undercut  banks.  Adults  feed  on  plant  material  and 
prey  on  other  fish,  insects,  and  crustaceans  (MDNR  201 3-TN21 57).  Channel  Catfish  are 
harvested  recreationally  and  commercially,  with  a  commercial  harvest  in  Delaware  of  17,329  lb 
in  201 1  (NOAA  2013-TN2174).  Recreational  harvests  in  2007  totaled  24,245  individuals  in  New 
Jersey  and  26,800  in  Delaware  (NOAA  201 3-TN21 75). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  collected  Channel  Catfish  in 
Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site,  in  the  offsite  large  marsh  creeks  near  the

Conger  Eel 

The  Conger  Eel  {Conger  oceanicus)  is  similar  to  the  American  Eel  in  appearance  and  life 
history.  Conger  Eels  occur  along  the  Atlantic  coast  from  Massachusetts  to  northern  Florida,  as 
well  as  the  northern  Gulf  of  Mexico,  where  they  occupy  coastal  portions  of  estuaries  and  waters 
over  the  continental  shelf  (Levy  et  al.  1 988-TN221 1 ).  Spawning  adults  migrate  to  the  Sargasso 
Sea  from  late  summer  through  winter  (Hood  et  al.  1988-TN2213).  Larvae  metamorphose  into 
juveniles  and  feed  primarily  on  decapod  crustaceans,  whereas  larger  eels  prefer  fish  (Levy  et 
al.  1988-TN221 1 ).  Commercial  harvests  of  Conger  Eels  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  totaled

Northern  Kinqfish 

The  Northern  Kingfish  ( Menticirrhus  saxatihs)  ranges  along  the  western  Atlantic  from 
Massachusetts  to  southern  Florida  and  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  Northern  Kingfish  occupy  shallow 
coastal  waters  and  estuaries  characterized  by  muddy-sand  substrates  (Corbett  2004-TN2136). 
Spawning  occurs  between  April  and  August  in  bays  and  sounds,  just  outside  of  estuary  habitats. 
Northern  Kingfish  prey  on  crustaceans,  small  mollusks,  marine  worms,  other  fish,  and  crabs 
(Corbett  2004-TN2136).  The  Northern  Kingfish  fishery  is  primarily  recreational,  although  there 
is  a  small  commercial  fishery.  Commercial  harvests  in  Delaware  totaled  21  lb  in  201 1 
(NOAA  2013-TN2174).  Recreational  harvests  in  201 1  totaled  330,062  individuals  in  New 
Jersey  and  10,145  in  Delaware  (NOAA  2013-TN2175). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  Northern  Kingfish  are 
commonly  abundant  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site,  but  rare  in  the 
offsite  large  marsh  creeks  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;

Northern  Searobin 


The  Northern  Searobin  ( Prionotus  carolinus )  is  a  bottom-dwelling  fish  that  prefers  habitats 
characterized  by  sandy  flats.  Adults  move  to  offshore  waters  to  spawn  between  late  spring  and 
summer  (CBP  2012-TN2135).  The  adults  prey  actively  on  a  variety  of  crustaceans,  mollusks, 
annelid  worms,  and  small  fish  (Bigelow  and  Schroeder  1953-TN2129).  The  commercial  harvest 
in  New  Jersey  for  all  searobins  in  201 1  totaled  27,370  lb  (NOAA  2013-TN2174).  Recreational 
harvests  for  all  searobins  in  201 1  totaled  1 .568,503  individuals  in  New  Jersey  and  38,658  in 
Delaware  (NOAA  2013-TN2175). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  Northern  Searobin  are

Scup 

The  Scup  ( Stenotomus  chrysops),  also  known  as  the  Porgy,  ranges  along  the  continental  shelf 
of  North  America  and  is  most  common  between  Cape  Cod,  Massachusetts  and  Cape  Hatteras, 
North  Carolina  (MDMF  2006-TN2161 ).  Scup  form  schools  in  offshore  waters  to  overwinter  and 
move  to  inshore  habitats  characterized  by  smooth  bottom  substrate  in  the  spring  and  summer. 
Adults  spawn  every  year,  with  spawning  occurring  between  May  and  August.  Adults  feed  on 
small  crustaceans,  mollusks,  annelid  worms,  jellyfish,  and  sand  dollars  (MDMF  2006-TN2161 ). 
Scup  is  fished  commercially  and  recreationally.  The  commercial  harvest  totaled  3,726,460  lb  in 
New  Jersey  and  8  lb  in  Delaware  in  201 1  (NOAA  2013-TN2174).  Recreational  harvests  in  201 1

Silver  Hake  feed  nocturnally  on  cephalopods  and  crustaceans  and  move  down  the  water 
column  to  rest  during  the  day  on  sandy,  muddy,  or  pebbly  substrate  (Col  and  Traver  2006- 
TN2148).  Silver  Hake  spawn  in  offshore  waters  between  May  and  June,  and  juveniles  may 
migrate  into  the  shallower  waters  of  estuaries  in  late  spring  or  early  summer  (Col  and 
Traver  2006-TN2148).  Silver  Hake  have  been  harvested  commercially  since  the  1960s  due  to 
their  abundance.  However,  overfishing  resulted  in  much  reduced  landings,  and  this  fishery  now 
has  declined  to  a  fraction  of  historical  landings  (Col  and  Traver  2006-TN2148).  The  commercial 
harvest  in  New  Jersey  totaled  3,037,593  lb  in  201 1  (NOAA  2013-TN2174). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  Silver  Hake  are  not  found

Spot 

Spot  ( Leiostomus  xanthurus )  occupy  estuarine  and  coastal  habitats  characterized  by  sandy  or 
muddy  bottoms  up  to  depths  of  60  m  (197  ft).  Juveniles  move  closer  to  inshore  habitats  during 
the  winter  and  move  offshore  in  late  fall  as  they  mature  and  prepare  for  spawning  activities. 

The  diet  of  the  juvenile  and  adult  Spot  includes  crustaceans,  polychaetes,  and  mollusks  (Phillips 
et  al.  1989-TN2192).  The  commercial  harvests  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  totaled  54,890  lb 
and  81 ,868  lb,  respectively,  in  201 1  (NOAA  201 3-TN21 74).  A  total  of  347,596  Spot  in  Delaware 
and  1 ,484  in  New  Jersey  were  harvested  recreationally  in  201 1  (NOAA  2013-TN2175). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  Spot  are  found  in

The  Striped  Bass  ( Morone  saxatilis )  is  an  anadromous  fish  that  ranges  along  the  Atlantic  coast 
of  North  America  and  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  from  western  Florida  to  Louisiana.  The  mid-Atlantic 
coastal  waters  are  considered  the  major  spawning  grounds  for  this  species — spawning  occurs 
between  April  and  June  in  or  near  freshwater  (Fay  et  al.  1983-TN2144).  Juveniles  prey  on 
small  crustaceans,  annelid  worms,  and  insects;  adults  feed  on  a  variety  of  other  fishes  and

Summer  Flounder 

The  Summer  Flounder  ( Paralichthys  dentatus)  ranges  along  the  Atlantic  coast  from  Maine  to 
northern  Florida.  The  Summer  Flounder  prefers  sandy  substrate  for  burrowing  but  may  also 
use  mud  or  silt  substrates  found  in  estuary  habitats  (Grimes  et  al.  1989-TN2150).  Spawning 
behaviors  are  not  clearly  understood  but  are  assumed  to  occur  sometime  between  late  fall  and 
early  spring  in  bottom  habitats  along  continental  shelf  waters  (Grimes  et  al.  1989-TN2150). 
Larvae  drift  into  estuarine  habitats  where  juvenile  development  takes  place.  Adults  feed  on 
smaller  fish,  squids,  crustaceans,  moliusks,  marine  worms,  and  sand  dollars  (Grimes  et 
al.  1989-TN2150).  It  is  an  excellent  food  fish  and  an  important  species  in  both  recreational  and 
commercial  harvests.  Commercial  harvests  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  totaled  2.830,403  lb 
and  836  lb,  respectively,  in  201 1  (NOAA  201 3-TN21 74).  Recreational  harvests  in  201 1  totaled

Weakfish 


The  Weakfish  ( Cynoscion  regalis)  is  a  member  of  the  drum  family  (Sciaenidae).  Weakfish 
range  along  the  Atlantic  coast  of  the  United  States  and  are  most  abundant  between  New  York 
and  North  Carolina  (MDNR  2013-TN2158).  Spawning  occurs  between  May  and  mid-July 
following  a  northern  migration  to  nearshore  coastal  waters  and  estuarine  areas  in  the  Delaware 
Bay  (Mercer  1989-TN2162).  Larvae  and  juveniles  primarily  feed  on  small  crustaceans  and 
anchovies.  Adults  prey  on  other  fish  such  as  the  Atlantic  Menhaden  and  Bay  Anchovy 
(MDNR  201 3-TN21 58).  Weakfish  are  harvested  recreationally  and  commercially  and  are  an

White  Perch 


The  White  Perch  ( Morone  americana)  has  a  native  range  that  includes  Atlantic  slope  drainages 
from  Canada  to  South  Carolina  (Stanley  and  Danie  1983-TN2195).  Spawning  occurs  primarily 
in  freshwater  habitats  in  estuaries,  rivers,  lakes,  and  marshes  but  also  can  occur  occasionally  in 
brackish  water  between  May  and  July.  The  eggs  attach  to  bottom  substrates,  and  larvae  and 
juveniles  remain  in  the  inshore  areas  of  these  areas  for  up  to  1  year  (Stanley  and  Danie  1983- 
TN2195).  White  Perch  return  to  brackish  waters  to  overwinter  in  deep  pools  of  tidal  creeks  or 
tributaries  and  bays.  Adults  prey  on  fish  eggs  and  larvae/juveniles  of  other  fish  species,  young 
squids,  and  crustaceans  (Stanley  and  Danie  1983-TN2195).  White  Perch  are  harvested 
commercially  and  recreationally  and  are  trophically  important  as  both  prey  and  predator. 
Commercial  harvests  in  Delaware  totaled  152,400  lb  in  201 1  (NOAA  2013-TN2174). 
Recreational  harvests  in  2011  totaled  731 ,360  individuals  in  New  Jersey  and  320,605  in

Windowpane  Flounder 

The  Windowpane  Flounder  (Scophthalmus  aquosus )  is  found  in  estuaries,  nearshore  waters, 
and  waters  along  the  continental  shelf  of  the  northwestern  Atlantic  from  the  Gulf  of  St. 

Lawrence  in  Canada  to  northern  Florida  (Hendrickson  2006-TN2153).  Adults  prefer  muddy  or 
fine-grain  sandy  substrates  in  waters  within  a  salinity  range  of  5.5  to  36  ppt  (Chang  et  al.  1999- 
TN2133).  Spawning  starts  in  February  or  March  and  peaks  in  May  over  inner  continental  shelf 
waters  (Chang  et  al.  1999-TN2133).  Adults  prey  on  small  crustaceans,  annelid  worms,  sea

cucumbers,  squids,  and  other  small  mollusks.  Although  it  is  not  currently  a  major  target  of  the 
commercial  fishing  industry,  1 1 ,902  lb  were  harvested  commercially  in  New  Jersey  in  2009 
(NOAA  2013-TN2174). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  Windowpane  Flounder  are 
not  commonly  found  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  are  rare  in 
offsite  large  marsh  creeks  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;

Winter  Flounder 


The  Winter  Flounder  ( Pseudopleuronectes  americanus )  ranges  along  the  Atlantic  coast  from 
Labrador,  Canada  to  the  State  of  Georgia.  Winter  Flounder  prefer  a  variety  of  bottom 
substrates  in  inshore  bays  and  estuaries  during  the  winter  and  migrate  to  deeper  water  in  the 
summer  (Hendrickson  et  al.  2006-TN2154).  Winter  Flounder  spawn  in  inshore  waters  at  night 
between  November  and  June  (Grimes  et  al.  1 989-TN21 50).  Eggs  adhere  to  each  other  to  form 
large  clumps  on  the  bottom.  Juveniles  remain  in  their  natal  shallow  waters  during  their  first 
summer  and  feed  on  diatoms,  small  crustaceans,  and  mollusks.  Adults  prey  on  small 
crustaceans,  annelid  worms,  small  mollusks,  and  fish  (Hendrickson  et  al.  2006-TN2154).  The 
Winter  Flounder  is  a  major  commercial  species  and  is  the  most  important  recreationally  caught 
flounder  in  inshore  waters  of  the  mid-Atlantic  (Grimes  et  al.  1989-TN2150).  The  commercial 
harvest  in  New  Jersey  totaled  6,051  lb  in  201 1  (NOAA  2013-TN2174).  The  recreational  harvest 
totaled  83,086  individuals  in  New  Jersey  in  2007  (NOAA  2013-TN2175). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  Winter  Flounder  are  not 
found  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  or  in  offsite  marsh  creeks  near  the 
PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-

Harvested  Invertebrates 

Five  species  of  invertebrates  occurring  in  the  region  have  been  harvested  commercially  in  New 
Jersey  and  Delaware.  These  species  are  blue  crab,  eastern  oyster,  channeled  whelk,  knobbed 
whelk,  and  northern  quahog  clam  (NOAA  2013-TN2174).  A  sixth  species,  the  horseshoe  crab, 
is  harvested  in  Delaware.  Since  2008  there  has  been  a  moratorium  in  place  on  the  harvest  of 
horseshoe  crabs  in  New  Jersey  (ASMFC  2014-TN351 1 ).

Blue  Crab 


The  blue  crab  ( Callinectes  sapidus)  ranges  along  coastal  waters  of  the  Atlantic  coast  from 
Massachusetts  to  South  America,  including  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  Blue  crabs  reside  in  benthic 
estuarine  habitats  characterized  by  low  salinity  waters  in  bays  and  estuaries  to  higher  salinities 
in  ocean  waters  (Hill  et  al.  1989-TN2155).  After  mating,  females  migrate  to  salinity  habitats  of 
greater  than  20  ppt.  The  female  broods  the  fertilized  eggs  and  then  releases  the  larvae,  which 
are  carried  away  with  the  current.  The  juveniles  return  to  the  estuarine  habitat  for  further  growth 
and  development.  Blue  crabs  feed  on  bivalves  and  a  variety  of  detrital  matter  (Hill  et  al.  1989- 
TN2155).  The  blue  crab  is  the  most  common  edible  crab  along  the  east  coast  of  the  United 
States  and  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  The  blue  crab  is  a  major  commercial  species  nationally  and  in 
the  mid-Atlantic  region,  with  harvests  of  9,599,249  lb  in  New  Jersey  and  3,501 ,968  lb  in 
Delaware  in  2011  (NOAA  2013-TN2174). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  blue  crabs  are  abundant  in 
Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  in  offsite  small  and  large  marsh  creeks 
near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;

PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ;  PSEG  2013-TN2586).  Blue  crab  had  high  impingement  density  rates  at 
SGS  and  HCGS  between  1986  and  1987  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572)  and,  while 
still  commonly  impinged  at  SGS  between  2003  and  2010,  the  density  rate  declined  compared 
with  density  rates  in  the  mid-1980s  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-

TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Eastern  Oyster 

The  eastern,  or  American,  oyster  ( Crassostrea  virginica)  is  a  marine  bivalve  that  settles  in 
shallow  saltwater  bays,  lagoons,  and  estuaries  along  the  Atlantic  coast  from  Canada  to  the 
Florida  Keys  and  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  (Stanley  and  Sellers  1986-TN2196).  Oysters  settle  in 
waters  with  a  salinity  at  least  as  high  as  10  ppt  and  attach  to  hard  substrates  in  aggregations 
known  as  oyster  reefs.  Adults  tolerate  a  wide  range  of  salinity  conditions,  but  optimal  embryo 
development  requires  a  salinity  range  of  15  to  23  ppt.  The  eastern  oyster  reproduces  by 
broadcast  spawning  of  sperm  and  eggs  into  the  water  column  from  late  spring  into  the  fall 
(Stanley  and  Sellers  1986-TN2196). 

Larvae  typically  settle  on  established  oyster  reefs  or  where  shell  substrate  is  present.  Oysters 
filter  feed  to  collect  planktonic  diatoms,  ostracods,  and  small  eggs  (Stanley  and  Sellers  1986- 
TN2196).  Under  optimum  conditions,  oysters  can  live  for  up  to  20  years  (Stanley  and 
Sellers  1986-TN2196).  The  eastern  oyster  supports  a  commercial  fishery  along  the  Atlantic 
coast  and  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  The  commercial  fishery  for  eastern  oyster  reported  a  harvest  of 
62,349  lb  in  201 1  for  Delaware  and,  according  to  NOAA  commercial  records,  the  last-reported 
commercial  fishery  in  New  Jersey  reported  a  harvest  of  550,086  lb  in  2008  (NOAA  2013- 
TN2174).  Additional  records  of  harvests  for  oysters  in  Delaware  Bay  from  direct  marketing  of 
natural  seed  beds  report  a  somewhat  consistent  average  harvest  of  around  83,000  bushels  per 
year  between  2008  and  2013  (HSRL  2014-TN4199).

Affected  Environment 


In  Delaware  Bay,  oyster  harvest  has  been  an  important  industry.  Natural  populations  were 
quickly  overharvested,  leading  to  establishment  of  aquaculture  and  fishery  management 
practices  in  the  early  1900s.  However,  increasing  industrial  pollution  and  lack  of  public  health 
sanitation  practices  led  to  declines  in  the  fishery  as  well  as  the  contribution  of  protozoan 
parasites  that  further  reduced  commercial  oyster  landings  (Canzonier  2004-TN2132). 
Significant  efforts  have  been  made  to  restore  oyster  habitat  and  conditions  for  propagation  in 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary  to  re-establish  this  fishery  (PDE  201 1-TN2190). 

Trawling  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  found  no  eastern  oysters  in  Delaware  River  Estuary 
waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  or  in  offsite  small  and  large  marsh  creeks  near  the  PSEG  Site 
(PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568; 

PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571;  PSEG 
2013-TN2586).  However,  the  Hope  Creek,  Fishing  Creek,  and  Liston  Range  oyster  beds  lie 
about  6  mi  to  the  south  of  Artificial  Island  and  SGS  (HSRL  2014-TN41 99). 

Horseshoe  Crab 


The  horseshoe  crab  ( Limulus  polyphemus)  is  a  marine  arthropod  that  occupies  both  shallow 
sandy  aquatic  habitats  and  deeper  nearshore  coastal  waters.  Horseshoe  crabs  occur  in  the 
Gulf  of  Mexico  and  along  the  northern  Atlantic  coast  of  North  America.  Spawning  involves 
onshore  migration  that  starts  in  the  spring  and  concludes  in  the  summer,  usually  during  evening 
high  tides  (CBP  2013-TN2134).  Females  lay  eggs  in  the  sand  that  take  about  a  month  to 
incubate  before  hatching.  Horseshoe  crabs  are  scavengers  and  feed  on  small  mollusks, 
worms,  dead  fish,  and  algae  (CBP  2013-TN2134).  The  horseshoe  crab  is  also  a  major 
commercial  species  in  the  region,  with  a  harvest  of  292,704  lb  in  Delaware  in  201 1 
(NOAA  2013-TN2174). 

There  have  been  no  reports  of  horseshoe  crab  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  near  the 
PSEG  Site  or  in  offsite  small  and  large  marsh  creeks  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565; 
PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG

Northern  Quahoq  Clam 

The  northern  quahog  clam  ( Mercenaria  mercenaria),  also  known  as  the  hard  clam,  is  a  heavily 
cultured  species  along  the  Atlantic  coast  (FAO  2004-TN2141 ).  The  northern  quahog  clam 
ranges  along  the  Atlantic  coast  from  Canada  to  southern  Florida  and  along  the  coastal  Gulf  of 
Mexico.  Northern  quahog  clams  prefer  the  intertidal  zone  of  coastal  lagoons  and  estuaries  on 
mud  and  sand  flats  with  a  salinity  range  between  12  and  30  ppt  (FAO  2004-TN2141 ). 

Broadcast  spawning  occurs  for  external  fertilization,  and  juveniles  secrete  byssal  threads  to 
assist  in  attaching  to  the  bottom.  As  is  common  in  bivalves,  the  northern  quahog  clam  feeds  by 
filtering  water  for  phytoplankton  (FAO  2004-TN2141 ).  The  northern  quahog  clam  is  harvested 
commercially  in  the  region,  with  harvests  of  1,516,071  lb  in  New  Jersey  in  2008  and  38,512  lb  in 
Delaware  in  2011  (NOAA  2013-TN2174). 

There  have  been  no  reports  of  northern  quahog  clam  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  near  the 
PSEG  Site,  or  in  offsite  small  and  large  marsh  creeks  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-

Whelk 

Both  the  knobbed  ( Busycon  carica)  and  channeled  ( Busycotypus  canaliculatus)  whelk  have 
been  harvested  commercially  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  waters  with  landings  between  2006 
and  2013  totaling  close  to  4  million  pounds  for  knobbed  whelk  and  more  than  1 .8  million  pounds 
for  channeled  whelk  (NOAA  2013-TN2174).  Both  whelk  species  occur  along  the  Atlantic  Coast 
from  Cape  Cod,  Massachusetts,  to  central  Florida  and  prefer  estuarine  or  shallow  shelf  water 
habitats  between  1  and  50  m.  Fertilized  eggs  develop  within  egg  capsule  strings  that  are 
anchored  to  the  ocean  floor.  Whelk  feed  on  bivalves  and  may  be  found  associated  with  oyster 
reefs  and  clam  beds  (Anderson  et  al.  2015-TN4200;  Davis  and  Sisson  1988-TN4201 ). 

There  have  been  no  reports  of  knobbed  or  channeled  whelk  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters 
near  the  PSEG  Site  or  in  offsite  small  and  large  marsh  creeks  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-

Ecologically  Important  Species 

The  Alewife  ( Alosa  pseudoharengus),  Atlantic  Silverside,  Bay  Anchovy,  and  Blueback  Herring 
are  considered  important  species  because  they  are  (1)  essential  to  the  maintenance  and 
survival  of  rare  or  commercially  or  recreationally  valuable  species,  (2)  critical  to  the  structure 
and  function  of  the  local  aquatic  ecosystems,  or  (3)  both. 

Alewife 


The  Alewife  ( Alosa  pseudoharengus)  is  an  anadromous  fish  closely  related  to  the  Blueback 
Herring.  Alewife  range  along  Atlantic  coastal,  riverine,  and  estuarine  habitats.  Broadcast 
spawning  occurs  during  spring  and  early  summer  months  in  freshwater  habitats  characterized 
by  gravel,  sand,  or  submerged  vegetation  substrate  (Fay  et  al.  1983-TN2142).  Juveniles 
remain  in  freshwater  nursery  habitats  until  fall,  when  they  migrate  to  brackish  and  marine  waters 
(Fay  et  al.  1983-TN2142).  Alewife  form  schools  and  feed  on  crustaceans,  insects,  small  fishes, 
and  fish  eggs,  and  they  are  forage  prey  for  larger  marine  species  (Fay  et  al.  1983-TN2142). 

In  2011,  the  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  (NMFS)  published  a  petition  to  consider  listing 
the  Alewife  (76  FR  67652-TN2080)  under  the  Endangered  Species  Act  (16  USC  1531  et 
seq.  -TNI 010).  However,  NOAA  determined  in  August  of  2013  that  listing  the  Alewife  as 
threatened  or  endangered  was  not  warranted  at  the  time  (78  FR  48944-TN2607). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  Alewife  are  common  in 
Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  and  in  offsite  small  and  large  marsh  creeks  near  the  PSEG  Site 
(PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;

PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Atlantic  Silverside 


The  Atlantic  Silverside  ( Menidia  menidia)  is  a  schooling  fish  that  occupies  the  shore  zone  of  salt 
marshes,  estuaries,  and  tidal  creeks  along  the  eastern  United  States  and  is  a  key  forage 
species  for  Striped  Bass,  Atlantic  Mackerel,  and  Bluefish  (Fay  et  al.  1983-TN2143).  In  the 
mid-Atlantic  region,  spawning  occurs  between  late  March  and  June  during  daylight  hours 
coinciding  with  high  tide.  Eggs  adhere  to  substrates  in  estuarine  intertidal  zones  such  as 
submerged  aquatic  vegetation.  Adults  are  omnivorous  and  prey  on  a  number  of  small  marine 
invertebrates,  insects,  algae,  and  diatoms  (Fay  et  al.  1983-TN2143). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  Atlantic  Silverside  are  not 
common  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  but  are  abundant  in  the  offsite 
small  and  large  marsh  creeks  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566:

ECS  1989-TN2572)  and  at  SGS  between  2003  and  2010  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005- 
TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009- 
TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Bay  Anchovy 

The  Bay  Anchovy  ( Anchoa  mitchilli)  is  a  small  schooling  fish.  Bay  Anchovy  occupy  euryhaline, 
estuarine,  and  connected  freshwater  habitats  and  can  tolerate  relatively  anoxic  conditions  in 
pollution-stressed  areas.  Spawning  occurs  in  waters  less  than  20  ft  deep  from  early  spring 
through  late  summer  (Morton  1989-TN2164),  and  females  spawn  every  4  to  5  days  during  the 
spawning  season  (Zastrow  et  al.  1991-TN2670).  The  Bay  Anchovy  is  a  key  species  in  aquatic 
food  webs  where  juveniles  and  adults  feed  primarily  on  zooplankton,  small  crustaceans,  and 
detritus  and  are  food  sources  for  predatory  fish  (Robinette  1983-TN339). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  Bay  Anchovy  are  highly 
abundant  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  and  in  offsite  small  and  large  marsh  creeks  near  the 
PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007- 
TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011- 
TN2571;  PSEG  2013-TN2586).  Bay  Anchovy  had  high  impingement  density  rates  at  SGS  and 
HCGS  between  1986  and  1987  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572),  and  while  still 
commonly  impinged  at  SGS  between  2003  and  2010,  had  lower  density  impingement  rates  than 
compared  to  the  mid-1980s  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567; 
PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;

Blueback  Herring 

The  Blueback  Herring  ( Alosa  aestivalis ),  like  the  Alewife,  is  an  anadromous  fish  that  lives 
primarily  in  marine  and  estuarine  waters  but  returns  to  freshwater  to  spawn  (Fay  et  al.  1983- 
TN2142).  The  Blueback  Herring  ranges  along  the  Atlantic  Coast  from  Canada  to  Florida. 
Blueback  Herring  spawn  in  the  spring  in  flowing  freshwater  habitats  characterized  by  hard 
substrate  (Fay  et  al.  1983-TN2142).  Juveniles  migrate  to  brackish  and  marine  waters  and 
mature  to  adulthood,  when  they  form  schools  and  prey  on  plankton  and  small  crustaceans  and 
are  forage  prey  for  larger  marine  species  (Fay  et  al.  1983-TN2142). 

Blueback  Herring  are  commercially  harvested  in  Delaware,  with  728  lb  taken  in  201 1 
(NOAA  201 3-TN21 74).  In  201 1 ,  NMFS  published  a  petition  to  consider  listing  the  Blueback 
Herring  (76  FR  67652-TN2080)  under  the  Endangered  Species  Act  (16  USC  1 531  et  seq.  - 
TNI 010).  However,  NOAA  determined  in  August  2013  that  listing  the  Blueback  Herring  as 
threatened  or  endangered  was  not  warranted  at  the  time  (78  FR  48944-TN2607). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  Blueback  Herring  are 
common  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  and  in  offsite  small  and  large  marsh  creeks  near  the 
PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007- 
TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011- 
TN2571 ;  PSEG  2013-TN2586).  Blueback  Herring  had  a  high  density  rate  of  impingement  at 
SGS  between  1986  and  1987  and  between  2003  and  2010  but  were  less  frequently  impinged  at 
HCGS  between  1986  and  1987  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572;  PSEG  2004-TN2565; 
PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG 
2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Non-Native  and  Nuisance  Species 

The  high  turbidity  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  precludes  the  development  of  algal  blooms 
near  the  PSEG  Site  (Miller  et  al.  2012-TN2686).  No  Asian  clams  ( Corbicula  spp.)  or  invasive 
blue  mussels  {Mytilus  spp.)  have  been  encountered  near  Artificial  Island  in  studies  from  the 
1980s  to  2009  (IAI  1980-TN2608;  PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006- 
TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010- 
TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

A  single  Asian  shore  crab  ( Hemigrapsus  sanguineus)  was  collected  in  surveys  at  one  marsh 
creek  sampling  station  in  May  2009  (PSEG  2013-TN2586).  In  addition,  three  other  invasive 
species — the  Chinese  mitten  crab  (Eriocheir  sinensis),  the  Northern  Snakehead  ( Channa 
argus),  and  the  Flathead  Catfish  ( Pylodictis  olivaris) — have  been  reported  in  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary.  Mitten  crabs  are  considered  potential  competitors  with  blue  crabs  and  can  damage 
estuarine  and  stream  habitat  by  extensive  burrowing.  Four  mature  male  mitten  crabs  were 
captured  in  commercial  crab  pots  in  late  May  2007  from  waters  near  New  Castle  County, 
Delaware  and  10  more  were  captured  in  2010  in  Delaware  Bay  (USGS  2012-TN2200).  The 
Northern  Snakehead  prefers  stagnant  waters  (e.g.,  shallow  ponds  and  swamps)  and  slow 
streams  and  has  a  wide  temperature  tolerance.  Northern  Snakeheads  have  been  observed  in 
New  Jersey  Delaware  River  Estuary  tributaries  starting  in  2009  but  are  not  believed  to  be 
established  in  Delaware  (USGS  2012-TN2201 ).  Flathead  Catfish  are  reported  to  occur  in  the

Delaware  River  Basin,  primarily  in  the  main  stem  of  the  Delaware  River  (NJDEP  2012-TN2185). 
Like  the  Northern  Snakehead,  Flathead  Catfish  are  voracious  predators  that  could  hinder  the 
shad,  sturgeon,  American  Eel,  and  Striped  Bass  restoration  efforts  in  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary. 

Federally  and  State-Listed  Species 

The  NRC  requested  information  from  the  FWS  by  letters  dated  October  26,  2010  (NRC  2010- 
TN2202)  and  July  31,  2013  (NRC  2013-TN2805)  regarding  endangered,  threatened,  candidate, 
and  proposed  species,  as  well  as  designated  and  proposed  critical  habitat  that  may  be  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  In  support  of  the  HCGS  and  SGS  license  renewal  applications,  FWS 
provided  information  on  June  29,  2010,  regarding  protected  species  in  the  vicinity.  Information 
from  these  consultations  was  used  as  the  basis  for  identifying  important  species  and  habitats 
(FWS  2010-TN2204). 

By  letter  dated  October  26,  2010  (NRC  2010-TN2203),  the  NRC  initiated  informal  Endangered 
Species  Act  (16  USC  1531  et  seq.  -TN1010)  section  7  consultation  with  NMFS  and  requested  a 
list  of  endangered,  threatened,  candidate,  and  proposed  species  as  well  as  designated  and 
proposed  critical  habitat  that  may  be  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  NMFS  provided  the 
requested  information  for  species  under  their  jurisdiction  by  letters  dated  December  9,  2010 
(NMFS  2010-TN2171)  and  October  25,  2013  (NMFS  2013-TN2804).  NMFS  received  the  draft 
EIS  (NRC  and  USACE  2014-TN4279)  and  BA  (NRC  and  USACE  2014-TN4313)  and  provided

Sea  Turtles 

The  Kemp’s  ridley  sea  turtle  ( Lepidochelys  kempii)  is  listed  as  Federally  and  State  endangered. 
The  Federally  threatened  Northwest  Atlantic  distinct  population  segment  (DPS)  of  the 
loggerhead  sea  turtle  ( Caretta  caretta)  is  listed  as  State  endangered  for  both  New  Jersey  and 
Delaware.  The  Atlantic  green  sea  turtle  ( Chelonia  mydas )  is  listed  as  endangered  at  both  the 
Federal  and  State  of  Delaware  levels  and  is  listed  as  threatened  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey.  All 
sea  turtles  have  certain  life  history  similarities  in  that  females  swim  ashore  to  sandy  beaches 
and  deposit  eggs  in  nesting  pits  that  are  covered  to  allow  incubation.  Juveniles  hatch,  struggle 
out  of  the  sandy  nest,  and  make  their  way  to  their  respective  ocean  habitats.  Although  there  are 
no  known  records  of  sea  turtles  nesting  along  Delaware  Bay  beaches,  sea  turtles  have  been 
observed  to  forage  in  Delaware  Bay  waters.  A  brief  overview  is  provided  for  the  sea  turtle 
species,  with  more  discussion  of  life  history  attributes  and  potential  for  impacts  in  Appendix  F  as 
part  of  the  BA  for  NMFS. 

Loggerhead  Turtle.  The  Northwest  Atlantic  DPS  of  the  loggerhead  sea  turtle  has  extensive 
migration  habits  that  extend  along  coastal  Atlantic  and  Gulf  of  Mexico  habitats  in  the  United 
States  (NMFS  and  FWS  2008-TN360).  During  the  summer,  Atlantic  loggerhead  turtles  migrate 
from  their  nesting  beaches  from  south  of  Virginia  northward  to  estuary  habitats  and  shelf  waters. 
Subadult  and  adult  loggerheads  are  primarily  bottom  feeders,  foraging  in  coastal  waters  for 
benthic  mollusks  and  crustaceans  (NMFS  and  FWS  2008-TN360).  It  is  unclear  whether  the 
turtles  over-winter  in  Delaware  Bay,  but  both  Delaware  Bay  and  Chesapeake  Bay  are  important 
summer  habitat  for  juveniles.  There  is  no  reported  loggerhead  turtle  nesting  along  Delaware 
Bay  beaches,  though  they  do  forage  in  the  bay.  Loggerhead  turtles  are  the  most  commonly 
observed  sea  turtle  species  in  the  vicinity  of  SGS.  In  1991 ,  23  loggerhead  sea  turtles  were 
recovered  from  the  SGS  cooling  water  intake  area.  Mitigation  measures  to  reduce  incidental 
intake  of  sea  turtles  at  the  SGS  were  implemented  between  1992  and  1993  (NMFS  1999- 
TN27 1 1 ).  Between  1 992  and  2001 ,  1 6  loggerhead  turtles  were  stranded  at  the  SGS  (NRC 
2010-TN281 1);  however,  none  have  been  stranded  since  2001  (NMFS  2014-TN4238),  and 
none  have  been  reported  stranded  at  HCGS  (NRC  2010-TN281 1 ).  The  conditions  of  the 
animals  and  reasons  for  their  take  are  not  known.  In  the  early  1990s,  sonic  and  satellite 
tracking  studies  of  loggerhead  sea  turtles  incidentally  taken  at  the  SGS  were  conducted 
(PSEG  2007-TN3122).  These  studies  indicate  the  released  turtles  did  not  show  a  particular 
affinity  for  the  SGS  intake  but  rather  moved  throughout  the  estuary.  Further  discussion  of  the 
potential  impacts  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  provided  in  Appendix  F 
under  the  BA  for  NMFS. 

Atlantic  Green  Turtle.  The  green  turtle  is  a  circumglobal  species  found  in  tropical  and 
subtropical  waters  along  continental  coasts  and  islands.  In  the  United  States,  green  sea  turtles 
primarily  nest  from  along  the  eastern  coastline  of  Florida  to  the  Georgia  border  (NMFS  and 
FWS  1991-TN358).  For  nesting,  females  require  the  high-energy  (wave-active),  sandy  beaches 
of  barrier  islands  and  mainland  shores  above  the  high-water  line.  Upon  emergence,  hatchlings 
immediately  seek  out  the  shore  and  open  water  (NMFS  and  FWS  1991-TN358).  Juvenile  green 
sea  turtles  drift  with  the  prevailing  surface-water  currents  until  they  reach  a  size  of  12  to  16  in.  at 
1  to  3  years;  then  they  return  to  shallow  coastal  waters,  where  they  spend  most  of  their  lives  in 
shallow  benthic  feeding  grounds.  Adult  green  turtles  feed  almost  exclusively  on  sea  grass  and 
algae  (NMFS  and  FWS  1991-TN358).

Affected  Environment 


The  green  turtle  is  not  reported  to  nest  along  Delaware  Bay  beaches  but  may  move  into  the  bay 
to  feed.  Green  turtles  are  occasionally  observed  in  Delaware  Bay.  A  total  of  two  Atlantic  green 
turtles  have  been  captured  at  SGS  since  it  began  operations,  one  in  1991  (alive)  and  one  in 
1992  (dead)  (NMFS  2014-TN4238).  Further  discussion  of  the  potential  impacts  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  provided  in  Appendix  F  under  the  BA  for  NMFS. 

Kemp’s  Ridley  Turtle.  In  the  continental  United  States,  the  Kemp’s  ridley  turtle  is  found 
throughout  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  and  United  States  Atlantic  seaboard  from  Florida  to  New  England 
(NMFS  et  al.  201 1-TN2169).  Nearly  all  reproduction  of  Kemp’s  ridley  turtles  takes  place  along  a 
single  9.3-mi  stretch  of  beach  near  Rancho  Nuevo,  Tamaulipas,  Mexico,  about  200  mi  south  of 
Brownsville,  Texas  (NMFS  et  al.  201 1 -TN21 69).  Hatchlings  migrate  rapidly  down  the  beach 
and  out  to  sea,  where  they  spend  a  period  of  about  2  years  in  the  pelagic  zone.  During  the 
pelagic  period,  they  feed  on  zooplankton  and  floating  matter,  including  Sargassum  weed  and 
the  associated  biotic  community.  After  a  pelagic  feeding  stage,  the  juvenile  ridleys  move  into 
shallow  coastal  waters  to  feed  and  grow.  The  young  subadults  often  forage  in  water  less  than 
3  ft  deep,  but  they  tend  to  move  into  deeper  water  as  they  grow  and  are  observed  associated 
with  portunid  crabs  (Callinectes  spp.),  their  most  common  prey. 

The  Kemp’s  ridley  turtle  is  not  reported  to  nest  along  Delaware  Bay  beaches,  but  it  has  been 
observed  foraging  in  Delaware  Bay.  In  1992,  two  live  and  two  dead  Kemp’s  ridley  turtles  were 
found  at  the  SGS  cooling  water  intake;  the  cause  of  mortality  was  not  reported  (PSEG  1992- 
TN3173).  In  1993,  a  live  Kemp’s  ridley  turtle  was  found  at  the  SGS  cooling  water  intake  (PSEG 
1999-TN2787).  Implementation  of  mitigation  measures  in  1993  reduced  the  likelihood  of 
additional  turtle  standings;  however,  two  Kemp’s  ridley  turtles  were  stranded  at  the  SGS  in 
2013  (PSEG  2013-TN2690;  PSEG  2013-TN3137)  and  two  more  in  2014  (PSEG  2015-TN4262). 
There  have  been  no  records  of  impingement  for  Kemp’s  ridley  turtles  at  HCGS  (NRC  2010- 
TN281 1 ).  Further  discussion  of  the  potential  impacts  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  is  provided  in  Appendix  F  under  the  BA  for  NMFS. 

Shortnose  Sturgeon 

The  Shortnose  Sturgeon  (Acipenser  brevirostrum)  was  initially  listed  as  a  Federally  endangered 
species  in  1967  and  is  designated  as  a  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  State  endangered  species 
(NOAA  2012-TN2173;  NJDEP  2012-TN2186;  DNREC  2013-TN3067).  Adult  Shortnose  Sturgeon 
use  freshwater  for  spawning  and  estuarine  and  marine  habitats  for  feeding.  Juveniles  migrate 
downriver  to  estuarine  waters  and  may  go  back  and  forth  between  freshwater  and  estuarine 
habitats  for  several  years  before  maturing  to  adults.  Adults  sometimes  migrate  to  marine 
habitats  for  feeding  but  live  the  majority  of  their  life  cycle  in  estuarine  habitats  (Rohde  et  al.  1994- 
TN2208;  NOAA  2012-TN2173).  Migration  to  spawning  habitat  occurs  in  late  winter  and  spring, 
and  adults  return  to  estuarine  waters  in  May  and  June  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149).  Spawning  occurs 
in  freshwaters  characterized  by  low-to-moderate  velocities  and  over  substrates  that  include  clay, 
sand,  gravel,  and  woody  debris.  Eggs  are  adhesive  and  survival  is  reportedly  dependent  on 
water  having  little  turbidity  (Rohde  et  al.  1994-TN2208).  Sturgeon  feed  on  benthic  invertebrates 
such  as  snails,  insect  larvae,  crustaceans,  and  worms  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149). 

Shortnose  Sturgeon  occur  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  system  (NOAA  2012-TN2173).  A 
Shortnose  Sturgeon  was  collected  in  a  bottom  trawl  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  just  to  the

south  of  the  PSEG  Site  in  2004  (PSEG  2005-TN2566).  Two  Shortnose  Sturgeon  were  collected 
in  2008  and  one  was  collected  in  2010  from  bottom  trawl  sampling  between  RKM  100  and  RKM 
120  (RM  62.1  and  RM  74.6)  to  the  north  of  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2011- 
TN2571 ).  From  the  commencement  of  operations  in  1977  through  2014,  32  Shortnose 
Sturgeon  impingements  have  been  reported  at  SGS — no  Shortnose  Sturgeon  impingements 
have  been  reported  at  HCGS  (NRC  2010-TN2811;  PSEG  2011-TN3365;  PSEG  201 1-TN3146;

Atlantic  Sturgeon 

The  Atlantic  Sturgeon  (Acipenser  oxyrinchus  oxyrinchus)  is  currently  listed  as  a  Federally 
protected  species  with  five  DPSs.  The  Gulf  of  Maine  DPS  is  considered  threatened,  and  the 
other  DPSs  (i.e.,  New  York  Bight,  Chesapeake  Bay,  Carolina,  and  South  Atlantic)  are  listed  as 
endangered  (77  FR  5880-TN2081;  77  FR  5914-TN4365).  Adult  or  subadult  Atlantic  Sturgeon 
occurring  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  may  be  a  part  of  any  of  the  five  DPS  populations  and 
are  considered  collectively  as  endangered.  The  Atlantic  Sturgeon  is  also  State-listed  as 
endangered  in  both  Delaware  and  New  Jersey  (Table  2-12).  Atlantic  Sturgeon  share  many  life 
history  characteristics  with  the  Shortnose  Sturgeon  in  that  adults  migrate  to  freshwater  to  spawn 
and  feed  on  benthic  invertebrates  such  as  worms,  crustaceans,  and  aquatic  insects 
(Gilbert  1989-TN2149).  Unlike  Shortnose  Sturgeon,  adult  Atlantic  Sturgeon  prefer  more  marine 
habitats  and  make  extensive  migrations  away  from  natal  estuaries  beginning  as  subadults 
(Gilbert  1989-TN2149).  Historically,  the  Delaware  River  supported  the  largest  population  of 
Atlantic  Sturgeon  along  the  Atlantic  coast  (Secor  and  Waldman  1999-TN2207).  Tagging  studies 
in  2005  and  2006  indicated  that  Atlantic  Sturgeon  followed  similar  migration  patterns  as 
Shortnose  Sturgeon  with  spawning  potentially  occurring  mid-to-late  June  in  the  upper  tidal 
Delaware  reaches  between  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania  and  Trenton,  New  Jersey  (Simpson  and 
Fox  2007-TN2194).  Gill  net  surveys  by  the  Delaware  Division  of  Fish  and  Wildlife  collected  over 
1 ,700  juveniles  near  Artificial  Island  and  the  Cherry  Island  Flats  (slightly  upstream)  between 
1991  and  1998  (ASSRT  2007-TN2082).  A  single  Atlantic  Sturgeon  was  collected  in  2004  and 
2009  in  bottom  trawl  sampling  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  between  RKM  100  and  RKM 
120  (RM  62.1  and  RM  74.6),  which  is  north  of  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2005-TN2566;  2010- 
TN2570).  An  additional  single  Atlantic  Sturgeon  was  collected  in  bottom  trawl  surveys  in  2006 
near  the  mouth  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  (PSEG  2007-TN2568).  Atlantic  Sturgeon  were 
not  reported  at  the  SGS  intake  screens  until  after  this  species  was  Federally  listed  as 
endangered.  Between  2012  and  May  31,  2015,  24  live  and  15  dead  Atlantic  Sturgeon  were 
reported  at  the  SGS  intake  system  and  no  impingements  were  reported  at  HCGS  (PSEG  2012- 
TN3142;  PSEG  2012-TN3143;  PSEG  2013-TN2693;  PSEG  2013-TN2694;  PSEG  2013-

impacts  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  provided  in  Appendix  F  under  the  BA 
for  NMFS.

Affected  Environment 


State-Listed  Species 

Three  New  Jersey  threatened  freshwater  mussel  species — the  tidewater  mucket  ( Leptodea 
ochracea ),  triangle  floater  ( Aiasmidonta  undulata),  and  eastern  pondmussel  ( Ligumia  nasuta) — 
are  listed  as  occurring  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey  (NatureServe  2012-TN2182; 

NatureServe  2012-TN2183;  and  NatureServe  2012-TN2184,  respectively).  As  these  are 
freshwater  species,  they  are  unlikely  to  occur  in  the  brackish  marsh  creeks  that  would  be 
crossed  by  the  proposed  causeway.  In  addition,  there  is  no  documented  occurrence  of  these 
unionid  mussels  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  (NJDEP  2013-TN3578).  Therefore,  these 
species  will  not  be  discussed  further. 

Essential  Fish  Habitat 

The  1996  amendments  to  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and  Management  Act 
(16  USC  1801  et  seq.  -TN1061)  identified  the  importance  of  habitat  protection  to  healthy 
fisheries.  The  amendments,  known  as  the  Sustainable  Fisheries  Act  of  1996  (Public  Law 
104-297,  16  USC  1801  et  seq.  -TN1060),  strengthened  the  authority  of  governing  agencies  to 
protect  and  conserve  the  habitat  of  marine,  estuarine,  and  anadromous  animals.  Essential  fish 
habitat  (EFH)  is  defined  as  the  waters  and  substrate  necessary  for  spawning,  breeding,  feeding, 
or  growth  to  maturity.  Identifying  EFH  is  an  essential  component  in  the  development  of  fishery 
management  plans  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  habitat  loss  or  degradation  on  fishery  stocks  and 
take  actions  to  mitigate  such  damage. 

NMFS  considers  the  estuarine  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  tidal  waters  near  the 
PSEG  Site  to  be  EFH  for  15  species  (PNNL  201 3-TN2687).  Appendix  F  contains  the  EFH 
assessment  (dated  June  2014)  and  a  supplemental  EFH  assessment  (dated  August  2015)  that 
consider  new  building  and  operation  activities  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site. 

2. 4. 2  A  A  qua  tic  Monitoring 

Extensive  biological  monitoring  data  exist  to  characterize  the  fish  and  macroinvertebrate 
communities  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  PSEG  Site.  Ecological  studies  near 
Artificial  Island  have  been  performed  since  the  late  1960s  to  characterize  the  aquatic 
communities.  In  compliance  with  the  New  Jersey  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System 
permit  for  SGS,  ongoing  annual  ecological  monitoring  studies  include  impingement  and 
entrainment  sampling  at  the  SGS  circulating  water  intake  structure;  fish  monitoring  in  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  and  marsh  creeks  with  trawls,  seines,  and  weirs;  and  monitoring  offish 
ladders  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  tributaries  (NRC  201 1 -TN31 31 ).  More  recent  surveys  of  the 
benthic  macroinvertebrates  and  fish  inhabiting  the  desilt  basins  and  the  smaller  marsh  creeks 
on  or  near  the  PSEG  Site  were  performed  from  winter  2009  through  winter  2010  (PSEG  2013- 
TN2586)  to  characterize  the  potential  area  of  immediate  impact  for  building  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

2.5  Socioeconomics 

This  section  describes  socioeconomic  resources  that  could  be  affected  by  building,  operating, 
and  decommissioning  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  It  is  organized  into  two 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Affected  Environment 


major  subsections  providing  details  on  demographics  and  community  characteristics.  These 
subsections  include  discussions  on  spatial  (e.g.,  regional,  vicinity,  and  site)  and  temporal  (e.g., 
10-year  increments  of  population  growth)  considerations,  where  appropriate. 

The  review  team’s  baseline  discussion  focuses  on  the  50-mi  region  surrounding  the  PSEG  Site. 
The  review  team  particularly  focuses  on  the  area  where  the  majority  of  operational  employees 
of  a  new  plant  would  reside.  The  review  team  assumes  this  area  would  coincide  with  the  area 
where  employees  of  the  SGS  and  HCGS  reside.  Approximately  1,300  people  are  employed  at 
SGS  and  HCGS.  Approximately  82.6  percent  of  these  employees  live  in  four  counties  in  two 
states.  These  counties  are  Salem  County  (41.0  percent),  Gloucester  County  (14.6  percent), 
and  Cumberland  County  (10.0  percent)  in  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle  County  (17.0  percent)  in 
Delaware  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  review  team  expects  the  construction  and  operations 
workers  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  likely  settle  in  these  same  areas.  The  remaining 

17.4  percent  of  the  workers  would  be  scattered  across  neighboring  counties  and  cities  and 
would  not  have  a  discernible  impact. 

Based  on  experience  with  construction  of  SGS  and  HCGS,  PSEG  believes  approximately 

84.5  percent  of  the  workforce  required  to  build  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  come  from  within 
the  50-mi  region  surrounding  the  proposed  site.  PSEG  assumes  the  remaining  15.5  percent  of 
workers  would  relocate  to  the  region  from  outside  and  would  choose  to  reside  in  the  same  four 
counties  that  house  the  majority  of  the  operations  workers  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Thus,  both 
adverse  and  beneficial  socioeconomic  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  plant  would  not  be 
noticeable  except  in  these  four  counties.  After  reviewing  the  PSEG  ER  and  other  information 
provided  by  the  applicant,  and  based  on  the  results  of  the  review  team’s  independent  analysis,  the 
staff  s  socioeconomic  analysis  focuses  on  Salem,  Gloucester  and  Cumberland  Counties  in  New 
Jersey  and  New  Castle  County  in  Delaware.  This  area  is  known  as  the  economic  impact  area. 

2.5.1  Demographics 

This  section  describes  the  population  of  the  PSEG  economic  impact  area,  focusing  first  on 
residents  who  live  in  the  area  permanently,  then  on  transients  who  may  temporarily  live  in  or 
visit  the  area,  and  finally  on  migrant  workers  who  travel  into  the  area  to  work  and  then  leave 
after  their  jobs  are  done. 

The  review  team  evaluated  the  demographic  characteristics  of  resident  populations,  transient 
populations,  and  migrant  workers  within  the  50-mi  region  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Because  the  focus 
of  the  review  team’s  analysis  is  on  the  economic  impact  area,  the  data  presented  focuses  on 
Salem,  Gloucester,  and  Cumberland  Counties  in  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle  County  in 
Delaware.  For  definitional  purposes,  “residents”  live  permanently  in  the  area,  while  “transients” 
may  temporarily  live  in  the  area  but  have  permanent  residences  elsewhere,  and  “migrant 
workers”  are  employed  seasonally  in  the  area.  “Transients”  are  not  defined  by  the  U.S.  Census, 
which  generally  only  captures  individuals  residing  in  the  area  during  the  time  of  the  census. 

The  data  used  in  this  section  were  derived  by  the  review  team  from  the  2000  and  2010 
censuses;  other  estimates  are  from  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau  (USCB),  including  the  2008,  2011, 
and  2012  American  Community  Survey  (ACS)  5-Year  Summary  Files;  and  the  U.S.  Department 
of  Agriculture's  2007  Census  of  Agriculture.  Census  data  and  ACS  estimates  were  used  to

make  comparisons  across  the  region  (by  sector),  among  counties,  and  with  the  states  of 
Delaware  and  New  Jersey.  Data  regarding  transient  populations  were  drawn  from  evacuation 
time  estimates  prepared  for  PSEG  in  2009  by  KLD  Engineering  (KLD  2009-TN2734). 

The  review  team  relied  on  population  projections  prepared  by  the  Delaware  Population 
Consortium  and  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Labor  and  Workforce  Development. 

2. 5. 7.7  Resident  Population 

As  shown  in  Table  2-13,  the  combined  population  of  the  four  counties  in  the  economic  impact 
area  was  1 ,045,640  in  201 1 .  More  than  half  of  this  population  (51 .31  percent)  lives  in  New 
Castle  County;  6.31  percent  reside  in  Salem  County,  the  host  county  of  the  PSEG  Site; 

14.93  percent  live  in  Cumberland  County;  and  27.45  percent  live  in  Gloucester  County 
(USCB  2002-TN2297;  USCB  2009-TN2344;  USCB  2012-TN2743).  Table  2-14  lists  the 
population  of  municipalities  and  townships  within  10  mi  of  the  site.  The  largest  population 
centers  are  Middletown,  Delaware  (17,608  residents)  and  Pennsville  Township,  New  Jersey 
(13,405  residents).  Salem,  New  Jersey,  located  about  8  mi  north  of  the  site,  has  5,239 
residents  (USCB  2012-TN2743).

Table  2-13  indicates  the  population  of  the  economic  impact  area  increased  at  a  rate  of 
0.97  percent  per  year  between  2000  and  2008,  with  average  annual  growth  ranging  from 
0.36  percent  in  Salem  County  to  1 .63  percent  in  Gloucester  County.  Between  2008  and  201 1 , 
population  growth  in  the  economic  impact  area  slowed  to  a  rate  of  0.17  percent  per  year,  with 
New  Castle  County  adding  residents,  while  the  three  New  Jersey  counties  experienced 
population  declines  (USCB  2002-TN2297;  USCB  2009-TN2344;  USCB  2012-TN2743). 

Table  2-15  presents  longer-term  population  trends  and  projections  for  counties  in  the  economic 
impact  area.  The  U.S.  Census  projects  the  population  of  the  overall  area  will  continue  growing, 
although  at  a  slower  rate  than  in  recent  decades.  New  Jersey  forecasts  Gloucester  County  will 
grow  at  the  highest  rate,  with  the  lowest  rate  of  growth  predicted  for  Salem  County.  According 
to  Delaware’s  projections,  New  Castle  County  will  continue  to  account  for  slightly  more  than  half 
of  the  population  of  the  economic  impact  area  (USCB  2002-TN3474;  DPC  2013-TN2317; 
NJLWD  2012-TN3096). 

Table  2-16  provides  the  age  and  gender  distribution  of  the  resident  population  within  the  four 
counties  of  the  economic  impact  area.  Women  account  for  more  than  half  of  the  population  in 
all  the  counties  except  Cumberland.  Delaware  is  51 .5  percent  female  and  New  Jersey  is 
51 .3  percent  female.  Cumberland  County  has  the  youngest  population  in  the  economic  impact 
area  with  a  median  age  of  36.7  years,  and  Salem  County  has  the  oldest  with  a  median  age  of 
40.8  years.  Delaware’s  average  age  is  38.6  years,  and  New  Jersey’s  average  age  is  38.7  years 
(USCB  201 1-TN2424). 

In  2012  in  New  Castle  County,  1 0.7  percent  of  the  population  has  income  below  the  poverty 
level,  slightly  lower  than  the  1 1 .2  percent  for  residents  of  the  State  of  Delaware.  In  the  New 
Jersey  portion  of  the  economic  impact  area,  Gloucester  County  has  a  significantly  lower  portion 
of  residents  below  the  poverty  level  (7.7  percent)  than  the  statewide  average  (9.4  percent), 
while  Cumberland  and  Salem  County  have  greater  percentages  of  the  population  below  the 
poverty  level  (16.1  percent  and  1 1 .2  percent,  respectively)  than  the  state  average  (USCB  2012- 
TN3095).  The  median  household  income  was  $71,133  for  Delaware  and  $71,180  for  New 
Jersey.  Table  2-17  provides  household  income  data. 

Table  2-18  provides  the  racial  and  ethnic  distribution  of  residents  within  the  economic  impact 
area.  African-American  residents  make  up  20  percent  of  the  population  within  the  economic 
impact  area,  ranging  from  11.1  percent  of  the  population  of  Gloucester  County  to  24.8  percent 
of  the  population  of  New  Castle  County.  Hispanic  residents  represent  less  than  10  percent 
of  the  population  of  the  four-county  economic  impact  area.  Gloucester  County  has  the 
lowest  proportion  of  Hispanic  residents  (4.6  percent),  and  Cumberland  County  the  highest 
(26.2  percent).  The  population  of  Cumberland  County  also  includes  10.2  percent  who 
self-identified  as  “some  other  race,”  much  higher  than  the  3.3  percent  average  for  the  economic 
impact  area  as  a  whole.  White  residents  are  the  most  prominent  race  in  all  four  counties, 
composing  more  than  two-thirds  of  the  population  in  each  (USCB  2002-TN3474).

2. 5. 1.2  Transient  Population 

Transient  populations  include  people  from  outside  the  area  who  work  in  or  visit  large 
workplaces,  schools,  hospitals  and  nursing  homes,  correctional  facilities,  hotels  and  motels, 
recreational  areas,  or  special  events  in  the  area.  A  study  published  in  2009  included  surveys  to 
estimate  the  2008  transient  population  within  10  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site  (KLD  2009-TN2734). 
Table  2-19  summarizes  the  study’s  findings.  Based  on  the  surveys,  the  transient  population 
within  10  mi  is  estimated  to  be  12,085,  with  66  percent  of  this  population  occurring  in  Delaware 
and  34  percent  in  New  Jersey.  Almost  all  of  this  population  occurs  5  to  10  mi  from  the  PSEG 
Site  and  includes  primarily  school  students  (34  percent),  employees  (other  than  those  at  SGS 
and  HCGS)  (34  percent),  tourists  and  recreationists  (26  percent),  and  people  undergoing 
medical  care  (5  percent).  The  study  did  not  determine  where  these  transient  populations 
originated,  and  some  of  them  may  reside  within  the  10-mi  area.

2. 5. 1.3  Migrant  Labor 

The  USCB  defines  a  migrant  laborer  as  someone  who  works  seasonally  or  temporarily  and 
moves  one  or  more  times  per  year  to  perform  seasonal  or  temporary  work.  Migrant  labor  in  the 
economic  impact  area  consists  mainly  of  refueling  outage  workers  at  SGS  and  HCGS  and 
migrant  farm  laborers.  Table  2-19  presents  data  on  transient  and  migrant  workers  in  the 
economic  impact  area. 

Scheduled  outages  to  carry  out  fuel  reloading,  equipment  maintenance,  and  other  projects 
occur  every  18  months  for  each  of  the  three  units  at  SGS  and  HCGS.  For  the  combined 
sites,  this  results  in  one  outage  every  6  months  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Between  1,034  and 
1,361  additional  workers  were  employed  during  the  most  recent  outages  (PSEG  2012- 
TN3099).  Because  each  outage  lasts  for  approximately  three  weeks,  it  is  unlikely  the  workers 
would  be  accompanied  by  their  families.  If  1 ,361  workers  migrate  into  the  economic  impact 
area  during  an  outage,  the  population  of  the  economic  impact  area  would  increase  by  about 
one-tenth  of  one  percent.  For  bounding  purposes,  if  all  of  the  workers  stayed  in  the  economic 
impact  area  county  with  the  smallest  population  (Salem  County)  during  the  outage,  the 
county’s  population  would  increase  by  2.1  percent. 

The  agricultural  sector  can  be  another  source  of  migrant  workers  due  to  seasonal  fluctuations  in 
labor  requirements.  The  2007  Census  of  Agriculture  indicates  164  farms  in  the  economic 
impact  area  employ  migrant  labor,  but  the  Census  of  Agriculture  does  not  directly  count  the 
number  of  migrant  workers.  Assuming  the  upper  bound  (i.e.,  that  all  2,471  outage  workers 
from  outside  the  region  of  interest  are  migrant  workers),  the  population  of  migrant  agricultural 
workers  is  negligible  compared  to  the  resident  population  of  the  economic  impact  area.  Even 
if  each  of  these  workers  in-migrated  with  two  additional  family  members  (resulting  in  a  total  of 
7,413  people),  the  2011  population  of  the  economic  impact  area  would  increase  only  by  less 
than  one  quarter  of  one  percent  (PSEG  2012-TN3099;  USDA  2007-TN31 12). 

2.5.2  Community  Characteristics 

This  section  characterizes  the  communities  that  could  be  affected  by  building  and  operating  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  following  subsections  describe  the 
socioeconomic  conditions  in  the  area,  including  the  economy,  tax-based  revenue, 
transportation,  aesthetics  and  recreation,  housing,  and  public  services. 

2. 5. 2.1  Economy 

The  review  team  expects  the  majority  of  direct  impacts  from  building  and  operating  a  new  plant 
would  occur  in  Salem  County,  where  the  PSEG  Site  is  located.  Unemployment  data  presented 
in  this  section  suggest  the  economy  of  the  economic  impact  area  grew  from  2002  through  2007, 
experienced  a  downturn  between  2008  and  2010,  and  recovered  modestly  in  201 1.  The 
economy  of  each  county  is  described  below. 

This  section  presents  information  on  the  labor  force,  employment,  and  income  within  the 
economic  impact  area.  Because  of  the  significant  national  economic  changes  that  have 
occurred  in  recent  years,  some  key  data  are  presented  for  a  10-year  period  to  illustrate  the 
disruptions  experienced  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  its  steps  toward  recovery.

The  data  in  Table  2-20  show  that  New  Castle  County,  Delaware  is  the  largest  employment 
center  of  the  economic  impact  area,  accounting  for  more  than  half  the  labor  force  and  employed 
persons  in  the  area  in  201 1 .  The  county  also  has  the  lowest  unemployment  rate  in  the 
economic  impact  area.  Within  the  New  Jersey  portion  of  the  economic  impact  area,  Gloucester 
County  is  the  largest  employment  center  and  has  the  lowest  rate  of  unemployment.  The 
unemployment  rate  of  New  Castle  County  matches  that  of  Delaware,  while  the  unemployment 
rates  of  the  New  Jersey  counties  exceed  that  of  the  state  as  a  whole  (BLS  2013-TN2342). 

Table  2-21  indicates  that  all  counties  in  the  economic  impact  area  experienced  gradually 
declining  rates  of  unemployment  from  2002  through  2007.  By  2010,  however,  unemployment 
rates  increased  significantly  in  all  the  counties,  ranging  from  increases  of  4.5  percentage  points 
for  New  Castle  County  to  7.0  percentage  points  for  Cumberland  County.  During  201 1 , 
unemployment  rates  again  declined  slightly  in  all  the  counties  (BLS  2013-TN2394;  BLS  2013- 
TN2342).

Table  2-22  presents  data  on  total  employment  by  industry  type  in  the  economic  impact  area  in 
2012.  In  Salem  County,  the  host  county  for  the  PSEG  Site,  the  top  four  employment  sectors 
include  educational  services  (22.8  percent  of  the  workforce),  manufacturing  (12.3  percent),  retail 
trade  (10.4  percent),  and  professional  and  scientific  services  (9.3  percent).  The  three  remaining 
counties  in  the  economic  impact  area  exhibit  similar  patterns,  although  the  rank  ordering  may 
change  slightly  (USCB  2013-TN31 13). 

Table  2-23  shows  the  residential  locations  of  operations  workers  at  SGS  and  HCGS  in  2008. 
According  to  these  data,  41  percent  of  the  workforce  resides  in  Salem  County,  and 
82.6  percent  resides  in  the  economic  impact  area  (including  Salem  County).  Nearly 
97  percent  of  the  workforce  resides  in  the  economic  impact  area  plus  five  additional 
counties  (Burlington  and  Camden  Counties,  New  Jersey;  Chester  and  Delaware  Counties, 
Pennsylvania;  and  Cecil  County,  Maryland).  Only  1.1  percent  of  the  operations  workers 
reside  more  than  50  mi  from  SGS  and  HCGS  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  review  team 
expects  operations  workers  for  a  new  plant  would  follow  a  similar  residential  pattern. 

The  three  reactors  at  HCGS  and  SGS  are  each  shut  down  for  refueling  every  18  months, 
resulting  in  an  outage  of  one  reactor  every  6  months  at  the  site.  At  these  times  workers  come 
into  the  area  to  refuel  the  reactors  and  perform  equipment  maintenance  and  other  projects. 
PSEG  employment  records  indicate  that  between  1,034  and  1,361  workers  were  involved  in 
each  of  the  most  recent  three  outages  (one  for  each  reactor)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Table  2-24 
summarizes  the  permanent  residential  locations  of  workers  participating  in  the  largest  of  these 
outages.  The  data  indicate  that  on  average,  about  29  percent  of  the  outage  workers  employed 
at  HCGS  and  SGS  live  in  the  economic  impact  area,  and  more  than  half  live  within  the  50-mi 
region  surrounding  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2012-TN3099).  The  percentage  of  workers  coming 
from  outside  the  50-mi  region  is  higher  for  outage  workers  than  for  the  workers  expected  to  be 
involved  in  building  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  because  outage  work  requires  a  higher 
percentage  of  specialty  workers  who  may  come  from  other  parts  of  the  country,  while  building  a 
new  plant  would  involve  a  higher  percentage  of  general  construction  workers  who  are  more 
likely  to  be  available  within  the  region. 

Table  2-25  presents  per  capita  income  data  for  the  counties  of  the  economic  impact  area  and 
the  states  of  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  for  the  period  2002  to  201 1 .  The  data  indicate  income 
levels  are  higher  in  New  Castle  and  Gloucester  Counties,  which  have  larger  populations  and 
labor  forces  than  Cumberland  and  Salem  Counties.  The  per  capita  income  of  New  Castle 
County  is  higher  than  that  of  the  State  of  Delaware,  while  the  income  levels  of  the  New  Jersey 
counties  within  the  economic  impact  area  are  lower  than  for  the  State  of  New  Jersey 
(USDC  2013-TN31 14). 

Table  2-25  also  shows  per  capita  incomes  grew  steadily  in  all  counties  of  the  economic  impact 
area  from  2003  through  2008  before  falling  for  most  counties  in  2009.  Growth  resumed  in  2010 
and  continued  through  2012  (USDC  2013-TN31 14).

2. 5. 2. 2  Taxes 

Table  2-26  summarizes  state  and  local  tax  rates  relevant  to  the  PSEG  Site.  Because  the  plant 
would  be  located  entirely  within  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  PSEG  would  be  obligated  to  pay  New 
Jersey  an  annual  energy  receipts  tax  of  9  percent  of  the  new  plant’s  total  net  income.  In 
addition,  the  plant  would  be  subject  to  annual  property  taxes  at  rates  established  for  Salem 
County,  currently  $1 .207  for  each  $100  of  assessed  value  (NRC  2013-TN31 16).

Sales  Taxes 

PSEG  also  would  pay  sales  taxes  on  purchases  of  materials  and  services.  As  shown  in 
Table  2-26,  applicable  sales  tax  rates  are  7  percent  in  New  Jersey  and  6  percent  in 
Pennsylvania,  with  purchases  within  Philadelphia  County,  Pennsylvania,  assessed  an  additional 
2  percent  tax.  Delaware  does  not  have  a  sales  tax.  Table  2-27  summarizes  the  operation- 
related  payroll  and  total  purchases  in  support  of  operations  at  HCGS  and  SGS  between  2005 
and  2008  in  each  of  the  relevant  jurisdictions  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  review  team  expects 
purchases  associated  with  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  distributed  similarly.  Thus, 
the  review  team  expects  approximately  65.0  percent  of  the  materials  and  services  purchases  for 
a  new  plant  would  be  subject  to  New  Jersey  sales  tax.  About  31.1  percent  of  materials  and 
services  purchases  would  be  subject  to  Pennsylvania  sales  tax,  with  approximately  10.2  percent 
of  the  purchases  subject  to  Philadelphia  County’s  additional  sales  tax.  New  Jersey  sales  and 
excise  taxes  brought  in  $11.7  billion  in  revenue,  and  Pennsylvania’s  sales  and  excise  taxes 
brought  in  $15.1  billion  in  revenue  in  201 1  (USGR  201 3-TN2652).

Corporate  and  Income  Taxes 

Employees  of  a  new  plant  would  contribute  income  taxes  and  property  taxes  to  the  jurisdictions 
where  they  reside  and  sales  taxes  where  they  make  purchases.  Based  on  data  presented  in 
Table  2-23,  72.4  percent  of  the  operations  workers  at  the  plant  would  be  expected  to  live  in  New 
Jersey,  17.1  percent  in  Delaware,  and  7.8  percent  in  Pennsylvania.  As  shown  in  Table  2-26, 
the  wages  and  salaries  of  employees  living  in  New  Jersey  would  be  subject  to  state  income  tax 
rates  of  between  1 .4  and  8.97  percent,  and  those  living  in  Pennsylvania  would  be  subject  to  a 
rate  of  3.07  percent  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Employees  residing  in  Delaware  would  be  subject 
to  state  income  tax  rates  ranging  from  0.0  percent  (for  incomes  under  $2,000)  to  $2,943.50  plus 
6.75  percent  of  the  amount  of  income  over  $60,000.  Table  2-27  indicates  how  the  operations 
payroll  for  HCGS  and  SGS  was  distributed  among  the  counties  where  employees  resided 
between  2005  and  2008.  The  review  team  expects  that  the  payroll  for  a  new  plant  would  be 
similarly  distributed.  In  2011,  New  Jersey  received  $10.6  billion,  Pennsylvania  received 
$9.8  billion,  and  Delaware  received  $1.0  billion  in  income  tax  revenue.  PSEG  has  a  9  percent 
energy  receipts  tax  rate  in  New  Jersey.  New  Jersey  received  $2.2  billion  in  revenue  in  201 1 
from  corporate  income  taxes  (USGR  2013-TN2652). 

Property  Taxes 

Employees  who  own  their  residences  would  pay  property  taxes  to  the  counties  and/or 
municipalities  in  which  their  homes  were  located.  In  the  New  Jersey  portion  of  the  economic 
impact  area,  property  tax  rates  vary  from  one  township  to  another  and  are  assessed  at  rates  per 
$1 00  of  assessed  value.  As  shown  in  Table  2-26,  rates  range  from  $1 .268  to  $3,688  in  Salem 
County,  $1,733  to  $5,503  in  Cumberland  County,  and  $2,232  to  $6,626  in  Gloucester  County

(NJ  Treasury  2013-TN2341 ).  Employees  residing  in  New  Castle  County,  Delaware,  would  pay 
a  county  property  tax  at  a  rate  of  0.7006  in  addition  to  a  municipal  or  school  district  property  tax 
at  rates  ranging  from  1 .8236  to  3.9901  (DEDO  2012-TN3121 ). 

2. 5. 2. 3  Transportation 

The  transportation  system  of  the  economic  impact  area  reflects  its  location  near  the  edge  of  the 
nation’s  fifth  largest  metropolitan  area,  the  Philadelphia  Metropolitan  Statistical  Area  (MSA) 
(USCB  2012-TN31 19).  Available  transportation  resources  include  a  diverse  road  network,  rail 
lines,  airports,  waterways,  and  public  transportation.  This  section  describes  each  of  these 
resources. 

Roads  and  Highways 

The  roads  in  the  economic  impact  area  are  an  extensive  network  ranging  from  major  interstate 
highways  in  the  northwest,  to  urban  street  networks  in  local  population  centers,  to  open 
highways  and  roads  in  more  rural  areas.  Figure  2-9  in  Section  2.2.1  shows  major  highways  in 
the  region.  Interstate  95,  which  connects  major  population  centers  on  the  East  Coast  from 
Miami,  Florida  to  the  Canadian  border,  passes  through  northern  New  Castle  County  near  the 
western  edge  of  the  economic  impact  area.  Interstate  295  diverges  from  Interstate  95  in 
northern  New  Castle  County,  crosses  the  Delaware  River  via  the  Delaware  Memorial  Bridge, 
and  traverses  the  northwestern  portions  of  Salem  and  Gloucester  Counties.  The  New  Jersey 
Turnpike,  a  major  north-south  connector  in  the  state,  also  passes  through  western  Salem  and 
Gloucester  Counties.  At  their  closest  points,  Interstate  295  and  the  New  Jersey  Turnpike  are 
approximately  14.0  mi  north  of  the  PSEG  Site. 

In  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site,  major  highways  include  New  Jersey  State  Routes  49  and  45, 
which  cross  the  New  Jersey  portion  of  the  economic  impact  area  in  northwest-to-southeast  and 
southwest-to-northeast  directions,  respectively.  These  highways  intersect  in  the  City  of  Salem, 
approximately  7.5  mi  northeast  of  the  site.  Delaware  Route  9  is  located  about  3.1  mi  west  of  the 
PSEG  Site,  and  Delaware  Routes  1  and  13  are  just  over  5  mi  to  the  west.  However,  these 
routes  are  located  on  the  other  side  of  the  Delaware  River  from  the  site  and  would  not  be 
affected  by  building  or  operating  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Figure  2-23  depicts  the  local  road  network  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  only  land 
access  to  HCGS  and  SGS  is  provided  by  Alloway  Creek  Neck  Road,  which  enters  the  southeast 
corner  of  the  existing  PSEG  property  and  ends  at  an  intersection  with  Hancocks  Bridge  Road 
approximately  7  mi  to  the  east.  From  this  intersection,  some  workers  from  Cumberland  County 
follow  Harmersville  Peck’s  Corner  Road  (County  Highway  657)  east  to  reach  New  Jersey  State 
Route  49.  However,  most  workers  travel  north  on  Hancocks  Bridge  Road  (County 
Highway  658)  to  the  City  of  Salem.  At  that  point,  they  may  choose  among  several  routes 
through  the  town  to  proceed  to  destinations  to  the  north,  northeast,  or  northwest  towards  the 
rest  of  the  economic  impact  area.  The  most  prominent  of  these  routes  are  New  Jersey  State 
Routes  49  and  45,  Grieves  Parkway,  Chestnut  Street,  and  Oak  Street.  Annual  traffic  volumes 
at  critical  locations  on  these  routes  are  shown  in  Table  2-28.

The  New  Jersey  Department  of  Transportation’s  FY  2012  to  2021  Statewide  Transportation 
Improvement  Program  (NJDOT  2012-TN2324)  includes  two  proposed  projects  for  Salem 
County  that  could  affect  the  accessibility  of  the  PSEG  Site: 

•  resurfacing  of  Commissioners  Pike  from  Woodstown  Road  (County  Road  [CR]  603)  to 
Watson  Mill  Road  (CR  672)  (approximately  11.7  mi  northeast  of  the  site)  and 

•  reconstruction  and/or  widening  of  Hancocks  Bridge  Road  (CR  658)  from  Fort  Elfsborg  Road 
(CR  624)  to  Hancocks  Bridge. 

In  conjunction  with  a  new  plant  at  the  site,  PSEG  would  build  a  causeway  from  the  site  to  the 
intersection  of  Money  Island  Road  and  Masons  Point  Road,  a  distance  of  approximately  4.8  mi 
(see  Figure  2-23).  The  northern  portion  of  the  causeway  would  follow  the  existing  alignment  of 
Money  Island  Road.  The  workforces  for  building  and  operating  a  new  plant  at  the  site  would  be 
expected  to  use  the  causeway  instead  of  the  existing  access  to  the  PSEG  Site.  Data  in 
Table  2-28  indicate  traffic  volumes  on  the  roads  at  the  northern  terminus  of  the  proposed 
causeway  (Fort  Elfsborg  Road  and  Money  Island  Road)  are  much  lower  than  those  on  other 
roads  in  the  vicinity  where  traffic  counts  were  conducted  (NJDOT  2012-TN2324). 

Rail 

Rail  lines  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  the  region  are  shown  on  Figure  2-9  in  Section  2.2.1. 
Lines  include  Norfolk  Southern  in  Delaware  and  Southern  Railroad  New  Jersey,  Conrail,  and 
Winchester  and  Western  in  New  Jersey.  The  railroad  closest  to  the  PSEG  Site  is  a  Southern 
Railroad  New  Jersey  line  that  serves  industries  in  the  City  of  Salem.  Only  freight  rail  service  is 
available  in  the  New  Jersey  portion  of  the  economic  impact  area.  The  nearest  Amtrak 
stations  are  in  Newark  and  Wilmington,  Delaware,  1 7  and  1 8  mi  northwest  of  the  PSEG  Site, 
respectively.

Air 

Table  2-29  lists  airports  serving  the  economic  impact  area.  The  New  Castle  County  Airport  in 
Delaware  provides  limited  commercial  and  private  air  services  connecting  to  other  major 
airports  in  the  region.  Two  additional  airports — one  each  in  New  Castle  County,  Delaware,  and 
Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey — serve  general  aviation  uses  only.  The  Philadelphia 
International  Airport  in  Pennsylvania,  approximately  31 .5  mi  northeast  of  the  PSEG  Site,  is  the 
nearest  airport  that  provides  commercial  flights  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

Water 

The  Delaware  River,  which  separates  the  Delaware  and  New  Jersey  portions  of  the  economic 
impact  area,  is  a  major  navigable  waterway  of  the  eastern  United  States.  A  total  of  12  ports  and 
harbors  are  located  along  the  river,  including  4  within  the  economic  impact  area:  Delaware  City 
and  the  Port  of  Wilmington  in  New  Castle  County,  Delaware;  Deepwater  Point  in  Salem  County, 
New  Jersey;  and  the  Port  of  Paulsboro  in  Gloucester  County,  New  Jersey  (WPS  2013-TN2353). 
The  existing  PSEG  property  is  located  at  Delaware  RM  52  and  includes  barge  slips  at  the 
southern  end  and  western  side  of  the  site. 

Public  Transportation 

Public  transportation  is  available  throughout  the  economic  impact  area.  The  Cumberland  Area 
Transit  System  provides  a  shared  ride  curb-to-curb  bus  transportation  service  to  county 
residents  who  are  at  least  60  years  old,  disabled,  veterans,  blind,  and  the  general  public.  Fares 
are  based  on  the  funding  source  that  is  available  to  the  client  and  the  purpose  of  the  trip  being 
provided  (Cumberland  County  2013-TN2309).  The  Gloucester  County  Transportation  Service 
provides  a  similar  service  to  Gloucester  County  residents,  with  an  added  category  for  low 
income  families  (Gloucester  County  2014-TN3123),  and  the  Salem  County  Specialized 
Transportation  Services  is  available  to  residents  who  are  60  and  over  or  disabled  (Salem 
County  201 3-TN2333).  New  Castle  County  public  transportation  is  provided  by  the  Delaware 
Transit  Corporation,  which  has  its  principal  hub  in  Wilmington.  This  transit  corporation  provides 
full-service  busing,  including  paratransit  services  (individualized,  non-fixed  routes),  and  has 
fixed  bus  routes  available  throughout  much  of  New  Castle  County  (NCATA  2014-TN3124). 

The  New  Jersey  Transit  has  several  bus  routes  that  serve  local  needs,  as  well  as  service  to 
Philadelphia  and  Atlantic  City.  New  Jersey  Transit  provides  one  local  bus  route  in  Salem 
County  and  four  bus  routes  that  provide  service  between  points  in  the  economic  impact  area 
and  Philadelphia  (New  Jersey  Transit  2014-TN3126).

2. 5.2.4  A  esthetics  and  Recreation 

The  economic  impact  area  is  located  primarily  in  the  Coastal  Plain  physiographic  province, 
which  is  characterized  by  gently  rolling  hills  and  valleys.  The  extreme  northwestern  corner  of 
New  Castle  County  is  in  the  Piedmont  province  and  exhibits  considerably  more  topographic 
relief  (NJDEP  2013-TN2329;  USGS  2013-TN2352).  Elevations  in  the  economic  impact  area 
range  from  sea  level  to  about  400  ft  in  the  Piedmont  province. 

The  immediate  visual  environment  of  the  PSEG  Site  is  dominated  by  the  Delaware  River,  which 
borders  the  site  to  the  west  and  south,  and  coastal  marshes  to  the  east  and  north  of  the  site. 

The  Delaware  River  is  approximately  2.7  mi  wide  at  this  point  and  consists  of  open  water  with 
occasional  commercial  and  recreational  water  craft.  The  coastal  marshes  extend  about  2.4  mi 
to  the  east  and  4.1  mi  to  the  north  and  consist  of  watercourses  meandering  through  marsh 
grasses.  Just  beyond  the  marshes,  the  topographic  character  changes  to  upland  agricultural 
areas  dominated  by  cultivated  fields,  deciduous  wooded  areas,  and  rural  residential 
development. 

The  industrial  visual  character  of  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS  facilities  contrasts  with  the  river 
and  coastal  marsh  surroundings.  The  structures  on  the  site,  particularly  the  HCGS  51 2-ft-tall 
cooling  tower  and  its  associated  plume,  are  prominently  visible,  particularly  from  the  Delaware 
River  and  from  the  opposite  shore  in  New  Castle  County.  While  these  features  are  also  visible 
from  the  surrounding  coastal  marshes,  trees  screen  them  from  view  from  the  upland  areas. 

The  economic  impact  area  offers  numerous  opportunities  for  outdoor  recreation.  The  Delaware 
River  immediately  west  of  the  PSEG  Site  is  used  for  recreational  boating  and  fishing.  In 
addition,  a  number  of  WMAs,  state  parks,  and  other  protected  areas  provide  settings  for  diverse 
outdoor  recreation,  including  boating,  fishing,  hunting,  bird  watching,  hiking,  and  camping. 
According  to  the  License  Renewal  EIS  for  HCGS/SGS  and  discussions  with  local  officials, 
muskrat  trapping  is  a  popular  recreational  activity  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site  (NRC  2012-TN2499; 
NRC  201 1-TN3131 ). 

New  Castle  County,  Delaware,  is  home  to  25  state  parks,  wildlife  areas,  and  other  recreational 
areas.  Several  recreation  areas  in  the  county  are  located  along  the  banks  of  the  Delaware  River 
and  offer  views  of  the  existing  structures  on  the  PSEG  Site.  These  areas  include  Augustine 
Beach  Access  Area  (169  ac),  Augustine  WMA  (2,667  ac),  and  Cedar  Swamp  State  WMA 
(4,840  ac)  (DNREC  201 1-TN3179;  DNREC  2013-TN2314;  Delaware  Greenways-TN2316). 

Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey,  hosts  two  natural  land  trusts  (Glades  Wildlife  Refuge  and 
Peak  Reserve)  that  occupy  7,756  ac.  In  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  17,775  ac  are  devoted  to 
recreation  and  wildlife  protection,  including  four  state  parks  (12,566  ac),  Supawna  Meadows 
National  Wildlife  Refuge  (4,600  ac),  Burdon  Hill  Preserve  (609  ac),  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA 
(9,500  ac),  and  Abbots  Meadow  WMA  (1,011  ac).  A  portion  of  the  New  Jersey  Coastal  Heritage 
Trail  runs  through  Salem  and  Cumberland  Counties. 

According  to  PSEG’s  ER,  5.97  million  people  visit  the  five  National  Wildlife  Refuges  and  two 
national  parks  annually.  Also,  there  are  27  recreational  facilities  within  10  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site 
with  approximately  3,100  daily  visitors  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).

Affected  Environment 


PSEG  allows  public  recreational  use  on  lands  it  owns  in  its  EEP,  including  marsh  and  upland 
areas  along  the  Delaware  Bay  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware.  These  include  two  wildlife 
observation  platforms  in  the  marsh  area  northeast  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Access  to  these  sites  is 
provided  by  Money  Island  Road,  and  facilities  include  parking  areas  and  boardwalks  to  the 
observation  decks. 

2. 5. 2. 5  Housing 

Approximately  83  percent  of  the  workforce  employed  at  HCGS  and  SGS  reside  in  the  economic 
impact  area.  An  additional  16  percent  live  within  50  mi  of  the  site  in  25  counties  in  New  Jersey, 
Delaware,  Pennsylvania,  and  Maryland  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Workers  involved  in  building 
and  operating  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  expected  to  follow  a  similar  residential  pattern. 
Thus,  this  section  concentrates  on  providing  housing  data  for  the  economic  impact  area,  while 
providing  less  detail  for  the  50-mi  region. 

Table  2-30  provides  data  describing  the  housing  environment  in  the  economic  impact  area.  In 
2012,  there  were  410,558  housing  units  in  the  economic  impact  area,  of  which  approximately 
92.6  percent  were  occupied.  Of  the  occupied  units,  approximately  72  percent  were  owner- 
occupied,  and  the  remainder  were  rental  units  (USCB  2010-TN3132).

Table  2-30  indicates  that  30,578  vacant  housing  units  were  available  for  purchase  or  rent  in  all 
counties  of  the  economic  impact  area  and  that  every  county  had  a  significant  supply  of  vacant 
units.  The  median  value  of  homes  in  the  economic  impact  area  ranged  from  $174,400  in 
Cumberland  County  to  $251 ,200  in  New  Castle  County,  while  the  average  monthly  rent  for 
rental  units  ranged  from  $936  in  Salem  County  to  $1,034  in  Gloucester  County  (USCB  2010-

Temporary  housing  is  available  at  many  hotels,  motels,  and  campgrounds  in  the  economic 
impact  area.  In  2007,  the  area  hosted  107  hotels,  including  60  in  New  Castle  County, 

17  in  Cumberland  County,  21  in  Gloucester  County,  and  9  in  Salem  County.  In  addition, 

10  campgrounds  and  recreational  vehicle  parks  (i.e.,  2  in  New  Castle  County,  4  in  Gloucester 
County,  and  4  in  Salem  County)  and  7  bed  and  breakfast  or  rooms  (i.e.,  3  in  New  Castle

County,  3  in  Cumberland  County,  and  1  in  Gloucester  County)  were  located  in  the  four-county 
area  (USCB  2007-TN3133). 

2. 5. 2. 6  Public  Services 

The  following  subsections  provide  information  about  public  services  provided  to  residents  of  the 
economic  impact  area.  The  public  services  discussed  include  water  and  wastewater;  police, 
fire,  and  medical  services;  social  services;  and  education. 

Water  and  Wastewater 

Residents  of  the  economic  impact  area  obtain  drinking  water  from  both  communal  water 
systems  and  individual  wells.  The  New  Castle  County  2012  Comprehensive  Plan  Update 
(NCCDE  2012-TN3151)  reports  the  county  is  served  by  six  water  systems,  including  four  public 
systems  and  two  private  systems.  In  addition,  numerous  private  wells  are  used  by  individual 
homeowners  and  businesses.  Surface  water  provides  75  percent  of  the  county’s  drinking  water, 
with  groundwater  providing  the  remaining  25  percent.  The  comprehensive  plan  estimates  there 
are  approximately  one  billion  gallons  of  surplus  drinking  water  available  within  the  county. 

The  comprehensive  plan  update  estimates  the  water  supply  of  the  northern  portion  of  New 
Castle  County  at  approximately  127  Mgd,  including  94  Mgd  surface  water  and  33  Mgd 
groundwater.  This  portion  of  the  county  is  considered  to  have  a  healthy  surplus  of  water  for 
peak  drought  demands  through  2020  and  beyond.  In  the  southern  portion  of  New  Castle 
County,  which  draws  all  its  water  from  aquifers,  the  available  groundwater  is  estimated  to  be 
20  to  30  Mgd.  In  this  area,  the  comprehensive  plan  update  expects  water  supplies  to  be 
adequate  through  2030  and  beyond,  based  on  conservative  projections  (NCCDE  2012- 
TN3151 ). 

Drinking  water  in  the  New  Jersey  portion  of  the  economic  impact  area  comes  from  a  number  of 
public  and  private  water  systems  and  from  individual  private  wells.  Table  2-31  lists  the  water 
systems  in  Cumberland,  Gloucester,  and  Salem  Counties,  along  with  information  about  the 
capacity  and  peak  demand  of  these  systems.  Capacity  exceeds  peak  demand  in  every  system. 

In  Cumberland  County  combined  peak  demand  is  86  percent  of  combined  capacity,  with  an 
excess  capacity  of  3.995  Mgd.  The  peak  demand  for  drinking  water  in  Gloucester  County  is 
63.8  percent  of  combined  capacity,  leaving  an  excess  capacity  of  24.733  Mgd.  In  Salem 
County  peak  demand  is  65.3  percent  of  combined  capacity,  with  an  excess  capacity  of 
2.646  Mgd.  Overall,  peak  demand  for  water  in  the  New  Jersey  portion  of  the  economic  impact 
area  is  70  percent  of  the  combined  capacity  of  the  water  systems,  leaving  an  excess  capacity  of 
31 .374  Mgd  (NJDEP  201 3-TN31 54).  Cumberland  County  officials  confirm  water  systems  in  the 
county  are  near  capacity,  while  Salem  County  officials  state  their  county  has  available  capacity 
above  current  usage  rates  (NRC  2012-TN2499).

According  to  data  in  Table  2-32,  wastewater  treatment  systems  in  New  Castle  County  had 
significant  excess  capacity  in  2008,  with  current  usage  amounting  to  69.20  percent  of  their  total 
capacities  and  32.36  Mgd  of  capacity  remaining.  However,  the  county’s  2012  comprehensive 
plan  update  (NCCDE  201 2-TN31 51 )  notes  that  the  northern  portion  of  the  county  (north  of  the 
Chesapeake  and  Delaware  Canal)  is  served  by  the  Wilmington  Wastewater  Treatment  Plant 
and  that  a  number  of  areas  in  this  part  of  the  county  have  little  or  no  remaining  available 
capacity.  In  these  areas,  unimproved  property  owners  desiring  to  develop  their  land  must  defer 
development  until  sufficient  capacity  becomes  available,  make  system  repairs  or  upgrades  that 
provide  sufficient  capacity  to  accommodate  the  proposed  development,  or  provide  onsite 
sewage  treatment. 

The  New  Castle  County  2012  plan  update  states  there  are  three  public  wastewater  treatment 
plants  in  the  southern  portion  of  the  county,  one  in  the  Town  of  Middleton  and  two  controlled  by 
the  county.  The  2008  data  in  Table  2-32  indicates  these  systems  are  small  (with  capacities 
ranging  from  0.05  Mgd  to  1.70  Mgd)  and  have  relatively  little  excess  capacity  remaining 
(0.01  Mgd  to  0.5  Mgd)  (NCCDE  2012-TN31 51 ). 

In  Salem  County,  seven  wastewater  treatment  plants  serve  34,059  people.  The  capacity  of 
these  plants  ranges  from  0.05  Mgd  to  1 .8  Mgd,  and  the  total  capacity  of  all  the  plants  is 
5.93  Mgd.  Current  flows  into  the  plants  total  3.88  Mgd,  leaving  an  excess  capacity  of  2.05  Mgd 
or  34.57  percent  of  the  total  capacity.  Average  daily  use  rates  for  the  individual  systems  range 
from  40  percent  of  capacity  for  two  plants  serving  the  Lower  Alloways  Creek  area  to  88  percent 
for  the  Penns  Grove  Sewer  Authority  (EPA  2012-TN3162). 

Three  wastewater  treatment  plants  in  Cumberland  County  serve  85,31 1  people.  The  plants 
have  a  combined  capacity  of  20.20  Mgd  and  an  average  daily  flow  of  1 1 .36  Mgd,  resulting  in  an 
excess  capacity  of  8.84  Mgd  (43.76  percent  of  total  capacity).  Usage-to-capacity  ratios  for  the 
individual  plants  range  from  48.72  percent  for  the  Cumberland  County  Utility  Authority  plant  to 
65.37  percent  for  the  Landis  Sewerage  Authority  plant  (EPA  2012-TN3162).  Cumberland 
County  officials  confirm  that  extra  capacity  is  available  within  the  county  (NRC  2012-TN2499). 
Gloucester  County  has  five  wastewater  treatment  plants  serving  190,369  people.  The 
combined  capacity  of  the  plants  is  28.25  Mgd,  and  the  total  average  daily  flow  is  22. 1 2  Mgd, 
leaving  an  excess  capacity  of  6. 1 3  Mgd  (27.7 1  percent  of  total  capacity).  Average  daily  use 
rates  for  the  individual  plants  range  from  50  percent  for  the  Harrison  sewage  treatment  plant  to 
91  percent  for  the  Greenwich  sewage  treatment  plant  (EPA  2012-TN3162).  County  officials 
note  most  of  the  public  wastewater  systems  serve  the  northern  portion  of  the  county,  while  the 
southern  portion  relies  mostly  on  individual  septic  systems  (NRC  2012-TN2499).

Affected  Environment 


Gloucester  County  and  Salem  County  are  engaged  in  planning  for  a  regional  wastewater 
treatment  system  that  would  link  to  a  treatment  plant  at  Carneys  Point  with  a  capacity  of 
20  Mgd.  The  new  system  would  allow  the  two  counties  to  replace  the  individual  septic  systems 
that  provide  service  to  more  rural  areas  (NRC  2012-TN2499). 

Police,  Fire,  and  Medical  Services 

Police  protection  in  the  economic  impact  area  is  provided  by  the  four  county  governments  and 
the  municipalities  within  them.  Table  2-33  presents  information  on  the  number  of  law 
enforcement  personnel  in  each  jurisdiction.  Salem  County  has  31 1  law  enforcement  personnel, 
including  268  officers  and  43  employees.  The  county  itself  employs  194  of  the  personnel,  and 
municipalities  within  the  county  employ  the  remaining  1 17.  Cumberland  County  has  447  law 
enforcement  personnel,  including  382  officers  and  65  civilian  employees.  A  total  of  383  of  the 
personnel  work  for  municipalities,  and  the  remaining  64  are  employed  by  the  county 
government.  Gloucester  County  has  706  law  enforcement  personnel,  including  647  officers  and 
59  civilian  employees.  Municipalities  employ  604  of  the  staff,  and  the  county  employs  102. 
There  are  1,041  law  enforcement  personnel  in  New  Castle  County,  including  836  officers  and 
205  civilian  employees.  The  county  employs  464  of  the  personnel,  while  municipalities  employ 
the  remaining  577  (USDOJ  201 1-TN31 1 1 ).  The  2010  ratios  of  residents  per  officer  are  246.6  in 
Salem  County,  410.7  in  Cumberland  County,  445.6  in  Gloucester  County,  and  644.1  in  New 
Castle  County. 

Fire  protection  in  the  economic  impact  area  is  provided  by  97  fire  departments  with  4,461 
firefighters.  Salem  County  has  19  fire  departments  with  407  firefighters,  Cumberland  County 
has  25  departments  and  695  firefighters,  Gloucester  County  has  57  departments  with 
1,343  firefighters,  and  New  Castle  County  has  34  departments  and  1,740  firefighters. (1)  The 
ratios  of  residents  per  firefighter  are  1 12.2  in  Salem  County,  200.2  in  Cumberland  County, 

212.1  in  Gloucester  County,  and  308.3  in  New  Castle  County.  Departments  in  Wilmington, 
Delaware;  Bridgeton,  New  Jersey;  and  Bridgeport,  New  Jersey  are  staffed  by  career  or  mostly 
career  (i.e.,  51  to  99  percent  are  career)  firefighters,  while  the  remaining  departments  rely 
mostly  or  entirely  on  volunteers  (FD  2014-TN3164). 

There  are  10  hospitals  in  the  economic  impact  area  with  a  total  of  2,697  hospital  beds. 
Cumberland  County  has  one  hospital  with  331  beds,  Gloucester  County  has  two  hospitals  with 
a  combined  total  of  256  beds,  Salem  County  has  two  hospitals  with  a  combined  total  of 
1 98  beds,  and  New  Castle  County  has  four  hospitals  with  a  combined  total  of  1 , 1 71  beds.  Of 
the  hospitals  in  New  Castle  County,  one  serves  only  veterans  (120  beds)  and  another  is  a 
children’s  hospital  (192  beds)  (AHD  2013-TN2306;  AHA  2013-TN2305).  Salem  County  officials 
note  that  Memorial  Hospital  of  Salem  County,  the  closest  hospital  to  the  proposed  site,  has 
significant  unused  capacity  (NRC  2012-TN2499). 


(1 )  Some  stations  are  substations  and  do  not  have  separate  staff.

Social  Services 


The  New  Jersey  Department  of  Health  is  responsible  for  social  services  in  the  state.  All 
counties  in  the  state  are  required  to  have  public  health  facilities  meeting  state  standards. 
Cumberland  and  Salem  counties  share  a  joint  facility  located  in  Salem  City.  In  addition, 
Cumberland  County’s  Department  of  Health  is  located  in  Millville.  Gloucester  County  is  served 
by  a  Department  of  Health  and  Senior  Services  in  Sewell  (NJDOH  2013-TN2391 ).  Each  county 
also  hosts  an  office  of  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Human  Services  that  provides  financial 
support,  transportation,  health  and  wellness  support,  and  other  services.  In  addition,  this 
department  operates  a  development  center  in  Cumberland  County  to  provide  care  and  training 
for  people  with  developmental  disabilities  (NJDHS  2013-TN2392). 

Social  services  in  Delaware  are  provided  by  the  Department  of  Health  and  Social  Services.  The 
department  provides  a  variety  of  services  through  an  office  in  New  Castle  County,  a  campus  in 
Delaware  City  providing  long-term  intermediate  care  and  alcohol  and  drug  rehabilitation,  the 
Delaware  Psychiatric  Center  in  New  Castle,  a  long-term  care  facility  in  Wilmington,  a  Child 
Support  Enforcement  facility,  and  numerous  service  centers  and  community  mental  health 
facilities  (DHSS  2013-TN2388). 

Education 

Table  2-34  lists  public  school  districts  in  the  economic  impact  area  along  with  their  enrollments,

in  15  public  school  districts  serving  75,058  students.  There  are  about  14  students  per  teacher

Cumberland  County  is  functioning  near  capacity.  The  Greenwich,  Logan,  Woolwich,  and 
Paulsboro  school  districts  in  Gloucester  County  and  the  Appoquinimink  district  in  New  Castle 
County  are  at  or  over  capacity.  Local  officials  in  Salem  County  indicate  schools  in  Elsinboro 
Township  and  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township  have  available  capacity  (NRC  2012-TN2499). 
New  Jersey  has  a  program  called  the  New  Jersey  Interdistrict  Public  School  Choice  Program 
that  allows  districts  to  enroll  students  who  may  not  necessarily  reside  within  the  same  district. 
This  program  does  not  cost  parents  extra.  For  the  2014-2015  school  year,  there  were 
136  districts  taking  part  in  this  program  (NJDOE  2014-TN3166).  Six  districts  in  Salem  County, 
four  in  Cumberland  County,  and  nine  in  Gloucester  County  take  part  in  the  program.  Delaware 
has  a  similar  program  called  Delaware  School  Choice  Program  that  has  193  schools  take  part 
throughout  the  state  (Delaware  2014-TN3167). 

There  are  10  colleges  and  universities  in  the  economic  impact  area  (CollegeStats  2014- 
TN3109).  Salem  Community  College  in  Carneys  Point  is  the  institution  closest  to  the  PSEG 
Site  (approximately  15  mi  north-northeast).  The  largest  college  or  university  in  the  economic 
impact  area  is  the  University  of  Delaware,  located  in  Newark,  approximately  18  mi  northwest  of 
the  site. 

2.6  Environmental  Justice 

Environmental  justice  requires  each  Federal  agency  to  identify  and  address,  as  appropriate, 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  human  health  and  environmental  effects  of  its  programs, 
policies,  and  activities  on  minority  and  low-income  populations  (59  FR  7629-TN1450).  The 
USCB  defines  minority  categories  as  the  following:  American  Indian  or  Alaskan  Native;  Asian; 
Native  Hawaiian,  or  other  Pacific  Islander;  Black  races;  Hispanic  ethnicity;  and  “other,”  which 
may  be  considered  a  separate  minority  category.  Low  income  refers  to  individuals  living  in 
households  meeting  the  official  poverty  measure  (USCB  2013-TN2363).  Executive  Order  (EO) 
12898  established  requirements  for  environmental  justice  (59  FR  7629-TN1450).  The  Council 
on  Environmental  Quality  (CEQ)  has  provided  guidance  for  addressing  environmental  justice 
(CEQ  1 997-TN452).  Although  the  Commission  is  not  required  to  comply  with  EO  12898,  the

NUREG-2168 


Affected  Environment 


Commission  has  voluntarily  committed  to  undertake  environmental  justice  reviews.  On  August 
24,  2004,  the  Commission  issued  its  policy  statement  on  the  treatment  of  environmental  justice 
matters  in  licensing  actions  (69  FR  52040-TN1009). 

This  section  describes  the  existing  demographic  and  geographic  characteristics  of  the  PSEG 
Site  and  its  surrounding  communities.  It  offers  a  general  description  of  minority  and  low-income 
populations  within  a  50-mi  region  surrounding  the  site.  The  characterization  in  this  section 
forms  the  analytical  baseline  from  which  the  determination  of  potential  environmental  justice 
impacts  will  be  made.  The  characterization  of  populations  of  interest  also  includes  an 
assessment  of  populations  of  particular  interest  or  unusual  circumstances,  such  as  minority 
communities  exceptionally  dependent  on  subsistence  resources  or  identifiable  in  compact 
locations,  such  as  Native  American  settlements. 

2.6.1  Methodology 

The  review  team  first  examined  the  geographic  distribution  of  minority  and  low-income 
populations  within  50  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site  using  data  from  the  U.S.  Census  American 
Community  Survey  5-year  summary  files  (2006-2010)  to  identify  minority  and  low-income 
populations.  The  review  team  then  verified  its  analysis  by  conducting  field  inquiries  of 
numerous  agencies  and  groups  (see  Appendix  B  for  the  list  of  organizations  contacted  and 
NRC  2012-TN2499,  for  the  field  notes). 

The  first  step  in  the  review  team’s  environmental  justice  review  is  to  examine  each  census  block 
group  that  is  fully  or  partially  included  within  the  50-mi  region  to  determine  whether  it  should  be 
considered  a  population  of  interest.  Census  block  groups  are  the  smallest  defined  area  for 
which  minority  and  low-income  populations  are  disaggregated.  USCB  defines  census  block 
groups  as  “statistical  divisions  of  census  tracts  ...  generally  defined  to  contain  between  600  and 
3,000  people”  (USCB  2013-TN2363).  If  either  of  the  two  criteria  discussed  below  identifies  a 
census  block  group,  that  census  block  group  is  considered  a  population  of  interest.  The  two 
criteria  are  whether 

•  the  population  of  interest  exceeds  50  percent  of  the  total  population  for  the  block  group  or 

•  the  percentage  of  the  population  of  interest  is  20  percentage  points  (or  more)  greater  than 
the  same  population’s  percentage  in  the  block  group’s  county. 

The  identification  of  census  block  groups  that  meet  either  of  the  above  criteria  is  not,  in  and  of 
itself,  sufficient  for  the  review  team  to  conclude  that  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts 
would  occur.  Likewise,  the  lack  of  census  block  groups  meeting  either  of  the  above  criteria 
cannot  be  construed  as  conclusive  evidence  of  no  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts 
to  a  population  of  interest.  To  reach  an  environmental  justice  conclusion,  the  review  team  must 
investigate  all  populations  in  greater  detail  to  determine  if  there  are  potentially  significant 
environmental  impacts  that  may  have  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  effects  on  minority  or 
low-income  communities.  To  determine  whether  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  effects 
may  occur,  the  review  team  considers  the  following: 


NUREG-2168

Affected  Environment 


Health  Considerations 

1 .  Are  the  radiological  or  other  health  effects  significant  or  above  generally  accepted  norms? 

2.  Is  the  risk  or  rate  of  hazard  significant  and  appreciably  in  excess  of  the  general  population? 

3.  Do  the  radiological  or  other  health  effects  occur  in  groups  affected  by  cumulative  or  multiple 
adverse  exposures  from  environmental  hazards? 

Environmental  Considerations 

1 .  Is  there  an  impact  on  the  natural  or  physical  environment  that  significantly  and  adversely 
affects  a  particular  group? 

2.  Are  there  any  significant  adverse  impacts  on  a  group  that  appreciably  exceed  or  are  likely  to 
appreciably  exceed  those  of  the  general  population? 

3.  Do  the  environmental  effects  occur  in  groups  affected  by  cumulative  or  multiple  adverse 
exposure  from  environmental  hazard?  (NRC  2007-TN2487). 

If  the  greater  detail  investigation  does  not  yield  any  potential  pathways  for  disproportionately 
high  and  adverse  impacts  on  populations  of  interest,  the  review  team  may  conclude  there  are 
no  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  effects.  If,  however,  the  review  team  finds  any  potential 
pathways  for  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts,  the  review  team  would  fully 
characterize  the  nature  and  extent  of  those  impacts  and  consider  possible  mitigation  measures 
to  lessen  those  impacts.  The  remainder  of  this  section  discusses  the  results  of  the  search  for 
potentially  affected  populations  of  interest. 

Drawing  on  data  presented  in  Section  2.5.1,  this  section  presents  the  demographics  of  the 
minority  and  low-income  populations  that  reside  within  a  50-mi  radius  of  the  PSEG  Site, 
including  the  economic  impact  area  consisting  of  Salem,  Gloucester,  and  Cumberland  Counties 
in  New  Jersey,  and  New  Castle  County,  Delaware.  The  consideration  of  a  50-mi  comparative 
geographic  area  surrounding  the  site  is  based  on  guidance  provided  by  NUREG-1555 
(NRC  2000-TN614). 

The  review  team  evaluated  all  census  block  groups  within  the  50-mi  region  to  identify  minority  and 
low-income  populations.  In  accordance  with  the  threshold  criteria  described  above,  the  review 
team  identified  block  groups  where  minority  or  low-income  populations  either  exceeded 
50  percent  of  the  block  group  total  population  or  were  at  least  20  percentage  points  higher  than 
the  corresponding  population  for  the  county  in  which  the  block  group  was  located.  Table  2-35 
presents,  for  the  50-mi  region,  the  percentage  of  minority  category  populations  in  each  state  and 
the  associated  threshold  values  for  the  second  (20  percent)  criterion. 

In  addition  to  the  minority  definitions  stated  above,  the  review  team  also  considered  Hispanic 
ethnicity  in  identifying  minority  populations.  According  to  the  USCB,  Hispanic  ethnicity  is  not  a 
race;  therefore,  a  Hispanic  individual  can  be  counted  in  any  of  the  race  categories  as  well  as  the 
Hispanic  ethnicity  category  (USCB  2000-TN2488).  The  review  team  did  not  include  Hispanic 
ethnicity  in  its  aggregate  race  estimate  because  the  Federal  government  considers  race  and 
Hispanic  origin  to  be  two  separate  and  distinct  concepts.

Figure  2-24  and  Figure  2-25  show  the  census  block  groups  with  minority  populations,  as  defined 
above,  within  the  50-mi  region.  There  are  4,139  census  block  groups  in  the  region,  of  which 
35.3  percent  had  an  “Aggregate  Minority"  (i.e.,  all  minority  groups  combined)  population  that 
exceeded  one  of  the  above  criteria  and  7.0  percent  had  Hispanic  population  that  exceeded  one 
of  the  above  criteria.  The  most  intense  concentrations  of  both  Aggregate  Minority  and  Hispanic 
populations  in  the  region  occur  in  Philadelphia  and  Delaware  Counties,  Pennsylvania;  Camden 
County,  New  Jersey;  and  New  Castle  County,  Delaware.  Most  of  the  block  groups  exceeding 
the  threshold  criteria  for  minority  populations  do  so  because  of  the  number  of  Black  residents 
(see  Figure  2-26). 

Table  2-36  presents  data  on  census  block  groups  exceeding  the  environmental  justice 
thresholds  in  the  four-county  economic  impact  area.  New  Castle  County,  Delaware  has  the 
largest  number  of  block  groups  exceeding  the  thresholds  for  the  Black,  Aggregate  Minority,  and 
Hispanic  block  categories.  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey  has  a  greater  share  of  block 
groups  exceeding  the  Aggregate  Minority  and  Hispanic  criteria  than  its  share  of  total  block 
groups.  None  of  the  four  counties  record  any  block  groups  exceeding  the  threshold  criteria  for 
the  categories  of  Asian,  Other  race,  or  Two  or  more  races.  The  census  block  groups  closest  to 
the  PSEG  Site  that  meet  the  minority  population  criteria  are  the  three  block  groups  that  make  up 
the  City  of  Salem,  approximately  8  mi  north  of  the  site.  These  block  groups  exceed  the 
thresholds  for  the  Black  and  Aggregate  Minority  categories. 

Figure  2-27  shows  the  census  block  groups  with  low-income  populations,  as  defined  above, 
within  the  50-mi  PSEG  region.  Approximately  12.8  percent  of  the  4,139  census  block  groups  in 
the  region  had  a  low-income  population  that  exceeded  one  of  the  above  criteria.  The  greatest 
concentrations  of  block  groups  exceeding  the  low-income  criteria  are  located  in  Philadelphia 
County,  Pennsylvania,  and  Camden  County,  New  Jersey. 

Within  the  four-county  economic  impact  area,  the  data  in  Table  2-36  show  more  than  half  of  the 
census  block  groups  with  low-income  populations  exceeding  the  threshold  criteria  are  located  in 
New  Castle  County,  Delaware.  In  addition,  the  proportion  of  such  block  groups  in  Cumberland 
County,  New  Jersey  is  significantly  greater  than  the  county's  share  of  total  block  groups.  The 
closest  census  block  group  to  the  site  with  a  low-income  population  as  defined  above  is  located 
in  the  southern  portion  of  Salem  City,  about  8  mi  north  of  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  figures  and  tables  used  in  this  section  are  modified  from  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280)  and  additional  information  provided  by  PSEG,  as  referenced.  The  methods  used  by 
PSEG  and  the  output  of  the  PSEG  analysis  have  been  verified  by  independent  analysis  by  the 
review  team  and  from  the  May  7  to  9,  2012  site  audit.

2.6.2  Scoping  and  Outreach 

NRC  staff  issued  advance  notice  of  public  EIS  scoping  meetings  in  accordance  with 
Commission  guidance  and  conducted  two  public  scoping  meetings  in  Carneys  Point,  Salem 
County,  New  Jersey  on  November  4,  2010.  Also,  from  May  7  to  9,  2012,  members  of  the 
review  team  met  with  elected  officials  of  each  county  in  the  economic  impact  area  as  well  as 
mayors  of  townships  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  One  purpose  of  these 
meetings  was  to  identify  and  assess  the  potential  for  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  effects 
on  minority  and  low-income  populations.  Through  these  meetings,  the  review  team  did  not 
identify  any  additional  groups  of  minority  or  low-income  populations  that  might  be  affected  by 
the  proposed  project. 

2.6.3  Special  Circumstances  of  the  Minority  and  Low-Income  Populations 

The  NRC  environmental  justice  methodology  includes  an  assessment  of  "pockets”  of 
populations  that  have  unique  characteristics  that  may  not  be  discerned  by  the  census  but  might 
receive  a  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impact  from  building  and  operation  of  a  project. 
Examples  of  unique  characteristics  might  include  lack  of  vehicles,  sensitivity  to  noise,  close 
proximity  to  the  plant,  or  subsistence  activities,  but  such  unique  characteristics  need  to  be 
demonstrably  present  in  the  population  and  relevant  to  the  potential  effects  of  the  plant.  If  the 
impacts  from  the  proposed  action  could  affect  an  identified  minority  or  low-income  population 
more  than  the  general  population  because  of  one  of  these  or  other  unique  characteristics,  then 
a  determination  is  made  whether  the  impact  on  the  minority  or  low-income  population  is 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  when  compared  to  the  general  population. 

2. 6. 3. 1  High-Density  Communities 

High-density  communities  are  minority  or  low-income  "pockets”  of  populations  that  are  not 
discerned  by  the  census  but  might  suffer  a  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impact  from 
building  or  operation  of  a  project.  Examples  include  densely  populated  low-income  housing 
projects  such  as  public  housing  or  U.S.  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  rental 
assistance. 

Salem  County  has  five  public  housing  projects,  two  in  Penns  Grove  (approximately  12  mi  from 
the  site)  and  three  in  Salem  City  (approximately  8  mi  from  the  site)  (Salem  County  2010- 
TN2486).  There  are  none  in  the  communities  closest  to  the  PSEG  Site  (Elsinboro  and  Lower 
Alloways  Creek  Townships).  The  review  team  identified  no  other  high-density  communities. 

2. 6. 3. 2  Subsistence 

The  review  team  also  thoroughly  searches  for  populations  that  may  have  common  subsistence 
behaviors  including  gardening,  gathering  plants,  fishing,  and  hunting.  These  behaviors  are 
used  to  supplement  store-bought  foodstuffs  or  medications  for  budgetary  purposes  or  for 
ceremonial  and  traditional  cultural  purposes.  Subsistence  information  is  typically  site-specific, 
and  the  review  team  must  take  care  to  differentiate  between  subsistence  and  recreational  uses 
of  natural  resources.  The  review  team  relied  on  a  study  conducted  for  PSEG  that  reports  on 
interviews  with  local  government  officials,  staff  of  social  welfare  agencies,  and  community- 
based  aid  programs  concerning  subsistence  living  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2012-TN2370). 


November  2015 


2-155 


NUREG-2168 


Affected  Environment 


According  to  the  study,  these  interviews  “identified  no  unusual  resource  dependencies  or 
practices  such  as  subsistence  agriculture,  hunting,  or  fishing.”  The  results  of  this  study  were 
independently  verified  between  May  7  and  9,  2012,  by  interviews  conducted  by  the  review  team 
with  local  officials  reporting  that  gardening,  hunting,  and  fishing  were  practiced  for  their 
recreational  value  rather  than  as  subsistence  activities. 

Through  its  review  of  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280),  its  own  outreach  and  research,  and 
scoping  comments,  the  review  team  did  not  identify  any  communities  with  unique  characteristics 
that  would  require  further  consideration. 

2.6.4  Migrant  Populations 

The  USCB  defines  a  migrant  laborer  as  someone  who  works  seasonally  or  temporarily  and 
moves  one  or  more  times  per  year  to  perform  seasonal  or  temporary  work.  Section  2.5. 1 .3 
discusses  the  two  largest  migrant  populations  within  the  economic  impact  area:  those 
associated  with  outages  at  HCGS  and  SGS  and  those  associated  with  agricultural  activities  in 
the  area.  That  discussion  finds  that  (1 )  up  to  1 ,361  workers  come  to  the  area  every  6  months  to 
perform  refueling  and  maintenance  at  the  existing  nuclear  plants  and  (2)  4,209  farm  workers  are 
employed  in  the  economic  impact  area  for  less  than  1 50  days  per  year,  some  or  all  of  whom 
may  be  migrant  workers.  Local  officials  indicate  migrant  agricultural  workers  are  employed 
seasonally  in  Cumberland  County  (residing  primarily  in  the  Bridgeton  area)  and  in  Gloucester 
County.  An  official  of  the  township  where  the  PSEG  Site  is  located  indicates  no  migrant  farm 
laborers  are  employed  in  the  township  (NRC  2012-TN2499). 

2.6.5  Environmental  Justice  Summary 

As  discussed  above,  the  review  team  found  that  35.3  percent  of  the  census  block  groups  in  the 
50-mi  PSEG  region  had  an  Aggregate  Minority  population  that  exceeded  one  of  the  criteria 
established  for  environmental  justice  analyses  and  that  7.0  percent  had  a  Hispanic  population 
that  exceeded  one  of  the  criteria.  The  review  team  found  that  12.8  percent  of  the  census  block 
groups  in  the  region  had  a  low-income  population  that  exceeded  one  of  the  criteria. 

The  review  team  found  that,  within  the  four-county  economic  impact  area,  more  than  half  of  the 
block  groups  with  Aggregate  Minority,  Hispanic,  or  low-income  populations  exceeding  the 
environmental  justice  thresholds  were  located  in  New  Castle  County,  Delaware.  The  block 
groups  nearest  to  the  PSEG  Site  with  populations  exceeding  the  criteria  are  located  within  the 
City  of  Salem,  approximately  8  mi  north  of  the  site.  These  block  groups  were  over  the 
thresholds  for  Black,  Aggregate  Minority,  and  low-income  populations. 

The  review  team  performed  analyses  in  greater  detail  before  making  a  final  environmental 
justice  determination.  These  analyses  can  be  found  in  Chapter  4  for  building-related  activities 
and  in  Chapter  5  for  project  operations. 

2.7  Historic  and  Cultural  Resources 

Historic  and  cultural  resources  refer  to  archaeological  sites,  historic  buildings,  shipwrecks,  and 
other  resources  considered  through  the  National  Historic  Preservation  Act  (NHPA)  (54  USC 
300101  et  seq.  -TN4157)  of  1966,  as  amended.  The  process  for  considering  these  resources 


NUREG-2168 


2-156 


November  2015 


Affected  Environment 


during  a  Federal  undertaking  is  identified  in  Section  106  of  the  NHPA  (36  CFR  Part  800- 
TN513).  In  accordance  with  Title  36  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  800.8(c),  the 
NRC  and  the  USACE  have  elected  to  use  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969,  as 
amended  (NEPA)  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661)  process  to  comply  with  NHPA.  As  a 
cooperating  agency,  the  USACE  is  part  of  the  review  team.  The  USACE  and  the  NRC  each 
have  their  own  areas  of  regulatory  responsibility  and  are  consulting  on  the  areas  of  the  project 
that  are  within  their  regulatory  authority.  Because  of  the  limited  regulatory  authority  of  each 
agency,  neither  agency  could  consult  on  the  entire  project.  The  NRC  is  consulting  on  the 
impact  (including  visual  impacts)  of  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on 
Artificial  Island.  The  USACE  is  consulting  on  areas  of  the  project  that  would  impact  wetlands, 
specifically  the  proposed  causeway  from  Money  Island  Road  to  the  PSEG  Site  and  potential 
dredge  areas  (barge  facility  and  water  intake). 

The  USACE  regulations  at  33  CFR  Part  325,  Appendix  C  (TN425),  describe  the  USACE 
obligation  to  comply  with  the  regulations  of  NHPA  (36  CFR  Part  800-TN513).  The  USACE 
utilizes  the  term  "permit  area”  to  describe  the  areas  within  their  regulatory  responsibilities.  In 
addition  to  any  specific  conditions  regarding  known  historic  and  cultural  resources  identified 
through  coordination  with  the  State  Historic  Preservation  Offices  (SHPOs)  and  Tribal  Historic 
Preservation  Offices  (THPOs),  every  USACE  DA  permit  includes  a  general  condition  that 
advises  and  requires  the  permittee  to  immediately  notify  the  USACE  if  any  previously  unknown 
resources  are  encountered  during  construction. 

The  NRC  has  determined  that  the  direct,  physical  area  of  potential  effect  (APE)  within  its 
authority  for  this  review  is  the  area  at  the  PSEG  Site  on  Artificial  Island  and  its  immediate 
environs  that  may  be  impacted  by  activities  associated  with  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  (Figure  2-28).  The  indirect  APE  that  encompasses  potential  visual  impacts 
for  this  review  is  located  within  the  PSEG  Site  vicinity  and  is  defined  as  a  zone  within  4.9  mi  of 
the  tallest  structures  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  The  USACE  permit  areas  are 
the  Money  Island  Access  Road  and  the  dredge  area  (Figure  2-28  and  Figure  2-29, 
respectively). 

For  the  purposes  of  NHPA  Section  106  review,  the  NRC  and  the  USACE  conducted 
consultation  with  the  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  SHPOs,  appropriate  THPOs,  Advisory  Council 
on  Historic  Preservation  (ACHP),  NPS,  interested  parties,  and  PSEG  for  onsite  and  offsite 
activities. 

Consultation  efforts  are  described  in  Section  2.7.3.  Additional  information  on  consultation  is 
also  located  in  Appendices  C  and  F.  Assessments  of  effects  from  construction  are  provided  in 
Section  4.6;  associated  assessments  relative  to  operations  are  provided  in  Section  5.6. 
Cumulative  effects  are  discussed  in  Section  7.5.

2.7.1  Cultural  Background 

This  section  provides  an  overview  of  the  historic  and  cultural  background  of  the  PSEG  Site  and 
region,  including  the  identification  of  historic  properties  and  cultural  resources  within  the  APEs. 
The  PSEG  Site  is  located  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  one  of  the  nine  townships  in 
Salem  County.  The  proposed  project  area  is  located  on  Artificial  Island,  an  island  created  by 
the  USACE  early  in  the  20th  century.  The  island  is  an  amalgamation  of  highly  disturbed 
hydraulic  dredge  spoils.  The  PSEG  Site  is  adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS/SGS  site  on  Artificial 
Island.  A  small  portion  of  the  north  end  of  Artificial  Island  is  within  the  State  of  Delaware. 

2. 7. 7.7  Paleo-lndian  Period 

The  first  conclusive  evidence  of  people  in  North  America  is  associated  with  the  Paleo-lndian 
Period,  which  dates  from  about  12000  BC  to  8000  BC.  This  was  a  period  of  major  climatic 
changes  as  the  glacial  conditions  that  persisted  during  the  last  age  abated  (ASNJ  2013- 
TN2399).  Climatic  conditions  in  New  Jersey  during  this  period  would  have  been  much  cooler 
and  wetter  than  today.  Tundra  and  spruce/pine  vegetation  would  have  predominated 
(Chesler  1982-TN2398).  During  this  period,  ocean  levels  were  lower  due  to  the  large  amounts 
of  water  trapped  in  the  ice  sheets  that  covered  North  America;  therefore,  New  Jersey’s 
coastlines  were  further  out  on  the  continental  shelf  than  they  are  today.  Paleo-lndian  cultures 
are  identified  by  the  large  fluted  points  associated  with  the  Clovis  culture  that  are  found 
throughout  North  America,  including  New  Jersey.  As  the  climate  moderated  toward  the  end  of 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Affected  Environment 


this  period,  people  adapted  their  behavior  to  accommodate  increasing  population  pressure, 
which  resulted  in  more  intensive  use  of  game  and  plant  life. 

2. 7. 1.2  A  rchaic  Period 

The  Archaic  Period  covers  the  7,000-year  period  between  about  8000  BC  and  about  1000  BC. 
Due  to  the  extensive  amount  of  time  covered  by  the  Archaic  Period,  it  is  often  refined  into  the 
Early  Archaic  Period  (around  8000  to  6500  BC),  the  Middle  Archaic  Period  (around  6500  to 
4000  BC),  and  the  Late  Archaic  Period  (4000  to  1000  BC).  The  division  between  the  Early, 
Middle,  and  Late  archaic  periods  is  partially  demarcated  through  changing  spear  and  dart  point 
styles.  The  environment  during  the  Early  Archaic  was  still  transitioning  away  from  the  glacial 
conditions  that  previously  existed.  Glacial  features  such  as  frost  thaw  basins  and  pingos 
(upthrusts  of  ice  and  earth)  still  were  found  on  the  landscape  and  were  used  by  early  archaic 
peoples  (ASNJ  2013-TN2399).  In  the  Middle  Archaic  Period,  temperatures  continued  to 
increase  and  the  sea  level  rose  accordingly.  It  is  assumed  that  many  of  the  coastal  camps  used 
by  earlier  peoples  (Paleo-lndian  and  Early  Archaic  peoples)  were  inundated  by  the  rising  ocean 
during  this  period  (ASNJ  2013-TN2399).  Middle  Archaic  sites  in  New  Jersey  show  evidence  of 
more  intensive  use  of  food  sources  (ASNJ  201 3-TN2399).  The  first  evidence  of  use  of  an  atlatl 
(a  spear  or  dart  thrower  that  increased  the  velocity  of  projectiles)  appears  during  the  Middle 
Archaic.  By  the  Late  Archaic  Period  (4000  to  1000  BC)  environmental  conditions  became 
similar  to  modern  conditions.  The  intensification  of  the  use  of  food  sources  continued 
throughout  this  period  and,  presumably,  population  pressures  also  increased  (ASNJ  2013- 
TN2399).  Stones  for  grinding  nuts  are  found  in  sites  dating  to  this  period.  There  is  also 
evidence  of  seasonal  exploitation  of  resources.

The  Woodland  Period  (1000  BC  to  AD  1000)  is  usually  defined  by  the  introduction  of  pottery 
and  the  bow  and  arrow,  along  with  the  first  evidence  of  horticulture.  This  2,000-year  period  is 
also  commonly  divided  by  archaeologists  into  an  Early  (1000  BC  to  AD  1),  Middle  (AD  1  to 
1000)  and  Late  Woodland  Period  (AD  1000  to  1600).  The  Early  Woodland  Period  is  defined  by 
the  introduction  of  pottery.  This  period  is  characterized  mainly  by  changes  in  pottery  styles  and 
projectile  point  styles  (Mounier  2003-TN2716).  The  Middle  Woodland  is  not  well  represented  in 
New  Jersey.  An  increase  in  permanent  settlements  occurred  during  the  Late  Woodland  Period. 
Pottery  styles  become  more  localized,  and  cache  pits  for  storing  food  are  used  more  heavily 
(Mounier  2003-TN2716).  Decorated  pottery  and  ceramic  pipes  also  are  associated  with  Late 
Woodland  sites.  The  Late  Woodland  Period  ends  with  the  coming  of  Europeans  to  North 
America. 

2. 7. 1.4  Contact  Period 

The  Contact  Period  refers  to  when  Europeans  first  arrived  and  interacted  with  Native  American 
populations.  New  Jersey  was  first  seen  by  Europeans  sailing  along  the  coast.  In  1524, 

Giovanni  da  Verrazzano  sailed  past  what  would  become  New  Jersey  (Chesler  1982-TN2398). 
The  local  population  at  the  time  of  contact  was  composed  of  Algonquian-speaking  people  called 
the  Lenape  (also  known  as  the  Delaware)  by  Europeans  (Veit  2002-TN2715).  Verrazzano  was 
followed  in  1609  by  Henry  Hudson,  who  was  exploring  the  area  on  behalf  of  the  Dutch.  The

Dutch  established  a  post  at  New  Amsterdam  (present-day  New  York  City)  in  the  1610s.  The 
first  permanent  European  settlements  in  New  Jersey  were  established  by  the  Dutch  in  the 
1620s. 

2. 7. 7.5  Historic  Period 

The  Dutch,  Swedes,  and  English  all  laid  claim  to  the  Delaware  River;  however,  it  was  the 
English  who  eventually  gained  control.  The  colony  of  New  Jersey  was  established  in  1664. 

The  colony  was  founded  on  principles  of  religious  tolerance.  Many  of  the  earliest  settlers  in  the 
colony  were  members  of  the  Society  of  Friends,  also  known  as  Quakers.  New  Jersey  was 
primarily  a  rural  colony  composed  of  agricultural  communities  (New  Jersey  2013-TN2718). 

During  the  American  Revolution  of  the  1770s,  New  Jersey  was  a  key  location  with  more  than 
100  battles  being  fought  in  the  state.  After  the  war,  New  Jersey  became  the  third  state  in  the 
union  in  1787.  New  Jersey  became  an  industrial  center  with  textiles,  clay  products,  and  iron 
and  steel  as  the  major  industries  (New  Jersey  2013-TN2718).  During  the  American  Civil  War, 
New  Jersey  fought  to  preserve  the  Union.  After  the  war,  the  state  continued  on  its  course  of 
industrialization.  Immigration  and  industrialization  led  to  issues  of  worker  rights  and  inspired  the 
election  of  progressive  politicians,  such  as  Woodrow  Wilson,  who  was  elected  governor  of  New 
Jersey  in  1910  and  president  of  the  United  States  in  1913.  The  Great  Depression  of  the  1 930s 
significantly  affected  the  industrial  base  in  New  Jersey.  However,  during  World  War  II  the 
economy  rallied  with  expansions  in  the  electronics  and  chemical  industries  (New  Jersey  2013- 
TN2718). 

Salem  County  is  located  in  the  southwestern  portion  of  the  state  and  is  bordered  by  the 
Delaware  River  on  the  west.  Most  of  the  land  along  the  Delaware  River  is  low  tidal  marshland. 
Some  of  the  earliest  European  settlements  in  New  Jersey  were  in  Salem  County  because  the 
county  controlled  the  Delaware  River.  Fort  Elfsborg  was  established  by  Swedish  settlers  south 
of  the  town  of  Salem  in  1642  (Harrison  1988-TN2714).  English  control  of  the  area  was  solidified 
in  the  1660s  to  1670s.  The  economy  of  Salem  County  revolved  around  timber,  agriculture,  and 
the  shipping  of  materials  between  Philadelphia  and  New  York.  Salt  hay  was  a  major  commodity 
for  the  region,  where  residents  relied  on  the  extensive  system  of  meadow  banks  and  dykes  that 
made  farming  of  the  marshlands  possible.  Many  of  the  patterned  brick  homes  found  in  the 
region  were  constructed  during  these  early  agriculturally  focused  years.  Glass  works  centered 
in  Wistarburg  were  established  in  1739  as  one  of  the  earliest  industrial  ventures  in  the  region. 
These  basic  components  of  the  local  economy  remained  relatively  uniform  until  the  Americans 
introduced  railroads  into  the  area  during  the  1830s.  At  that  point,  the  industrial  presence  in  the 
region  expanded.  During  the  19th  and  early  20th  centuries,  manufacturing,  agriculture,  and 
canning  developed  into  the  mainstays  of  the  local  economy.  World  War  II  saw  a  marked 
increase  in  chemical  plants  in  southern  New  Jersey.  The  local  economy  remained  consistent 
until  the  construction  of  the  PSEG  nuclear  power  plant  in  1985  (Harrison  1988-TN2714). 

2.7.2  Historic  and  Cultural  Resources  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  Offsite  Areas 

The  information  presented  in  this  section  was  collected  from  area  repositories,  the  New  Jersey 
SHPO,  the  New  Jersey  State  Museum  (NJSM),  the  Delaware  SHPO,  and  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG 
2015-TN4280).  Historic  properties  (resources  eligible  or  potentially  eligible  for  nomination  to  the

Because  of  the  limits  placed  on  the  agencies  by  their  regulatory  authorities,  each  agency  is 
responsible  for  a  distinct  APE.  The  APE  for  the  NRC  consists  of  the  PSEG  Site  on  Artificial 
Island,  which  would  be  the  location  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  and  the  area  affected  by  the

visual  impact  of  a  new  plant.  The  USACE  permit  area  is  that  area  that  would  be  affected  by  the 
proposed  causeway  from  Money  Island  Road  to  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  area  affected  by 
dredging  the  Delaware  River. 

NJSM  houses  the  archaeological  site  files  for  the  State,  and  the  New  Jersey  SHPO  houses 
information  on  historic  resources  such  as  buildings  and  houses,  including  information 
concerning  the  National  or  State  Register  eligibility  status  of  these  resources.  Online  sources 
were  used  to  identify  properties  listed  in  the  NRHP  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey  and  New 
Castle  County,  Delaware  (NPS  2013-TN2400). 

A  total  of  23  properties  are  listed  on  the  NRHP  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The  closest 
property  to  the  PSEG  Site  is  the  Joseph  Ware  House,  3.54  mi  to  the  northeast  of  the  site. 

2. 7.2. 7  NRC  Area  of  Potential  Effect 

Artificial  Island 

Artificial  Island  is  a  1,500-ac  island  created  by  the  USACE  beginning  in  the  early  20th  century. 
The  island  began  as  buildup  of  hydraulic  dredge  spoils  within  a  progressively  enlarged  diked 
area  established  around  a  natural  sandbar  that  projected  into  the  river  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ). 

A  review  of  NJSM  files  shows  that  there  are  no  previously  recorded  archaeological  or  above 
ground  historic  architectural  resources  identified  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Because  of  the  use  of 
hydraulic  fill  to  construct  the  island,  intact  archaeological  deposits  are  considered  unlikely 
within  the  fill  material.  PSEG  reviewed  the  soil  borings  collected  as  part  of  a  geotechnical 
investigation  of  the  PSEG  Site  to  determine  if  intact  prehistoric  soils  were  buried  during  the 
construction  of  Artificial  Island.  The  soil  borings  reveal  a  soil  stratigraphy  consisting  of 
40  to  50  ft  of  hydraulic  fill  material  overlying  a  rocky  streambed  deposit.  The  PSEG  soil  borings 
revealed  no  evidence  to  support  the  presence  of  buried  prehistoric  soils  underneath  Artificial 
Island  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Based  on  the  lack  of  evidence  for  paleosols  and  the  use  of 
historic  era  hydraulic  dredge  spoils  to  construct  the  island,  the  staff  determined  that  there  is  no 
potential  for  intact  archaeological  material  to  be  present  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  the  staff 
determined  that  there  is  no  effect  for  the  Artificial  Island  APE  because  there  are  no  NRHP  listed 
or  eligible  historic  properties  on  Artificial  Island. 

Visual  Resource  Review  from  the  Plant  Structures 

The  NRC  evaluated  and  consulted  under  Section  1 06  of  the  NHPA  with  the  New  Jersey 
and  Delaware  SHPOs  on  the  impacts  of  the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  in  the  final  environmental 
impact  statement  for  license  renewal  for  SGS  and  HCGS  (NRC  201 1-TN3131).  The  tallest 
structure  on  Artificial  Island  is  the  51 4-ft-tall  HCGS  natural  draft  cooling  tower  (NDCT),  which 
can  be  seen  from  many  miles  away  (particularly  the  cooling  tower  and  the  plume  it  produces). 
The  existing  HCGS/SGS  complex  can  easily  be  seen  from  the  marsh  areas  and  the  river  itself, 
while  in  the  more  populated  areas,  it  is  often  blocked  by  trees  or  houses  and  can  be  seen  only 
from  certain  angles.  In  NUREG-1437  Supplement  45  for  license  renewal  for  SGS  and  HCGS, 
consultation  resulted  in  a  determination  of  no  adverse  effect  to  any  property  listed  on  or  eligible 
for  listing  on  the  NRHP  (NRC  201 1-TN3131).

The  NRC  evaluated  the  visual  impact  analysis  performed  by  PSEG  for  the  ESP  application. 

The  analysis  was  aided  by  using  the  cooling  tower  for  the  existing  HCGS.  The  PPE  value  for 
the  height  of  the  proposed  cooling  towers  (590  ft)  is  higher  than  the  existing  tower  (514  ft). 

PSEG  conducted  two  visual  impact  assessments  for  the  project,  and  the  applicable  reports 
have  been  submitted  to  the  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  SHPOs  (MACTEC  2009-TN2543; 

AKRF  2012-TN2876).  The  assessments  focused  on  NRHP-listed  or  eligible  properties  within 
4.9  mi  of  the  site  and  from  which  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  visible.  The  visual  impact  analysis 
identified  several  historic  properties  located  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  that  have  the 
potential  to  be  visually  affected  by  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  site, 
including  six  NRHP-listed  or  eligible  architectural  resources  in  New  Jersey  and  18  in  Delaware 
(see  Table  2-37)  (AKRF  2012-TN2876).  Two  potentially  eligible  resources  were  identified  in 
New  Jersey,  and  one  was  noted  in  Delaware  (AKRF  2012-TN2876).  Most  of  the  resources 
identified  were  historic  houses;  however,  the  cooling  tower  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  visible 
from  two  historic  districts  in  Delaware  (Port  Penn  and  Ashton  historic  districts).  Additionally, 
one  of  the  resources  identified,  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House  in  New  Jersey,  has 
National  Historic  Landmark  (NHL)  status. 

2. 7. 2. 2  USA  CE  Permit  Area 

Money  Island  Access  Road 

The  permit  area  for  the  Money  Island  access  road  was  defined  in  a  memorandum  dated 
February  5,  2015  (USACE  2015-TN4340).  The  permit  area  is  50  feet  wide  (25  ft  on  either  side 
of  the  centerline)  and  extends  along  Money  Island  Road  to  Mason  Point  Road,  a  distance  of 
0.7  mi.  The  closest  NRHP  listed  property  to  the  proposed  causeway  is  the  Abel  and  Mary 
Nicholson  House,  less  than  1  mi  from  the  northern  terminus  of  the  causeway.  The  closest  listed 
property  in  New  Castle  County,  Delaware  is  the  Augustine  Beach  Hotel,  3  mi  northwest  of  the 
project  area. 

The  Phase  I  archaeological  survey  conducted  by  the  applicant  on  portions  of  the  proposed 
causeway  (that  are  outside  the  salt  marsh)  identified  six  archaeological  sites:  28SA179, 
28SA180,  28SA181, 28SA182,  28SA183,  and  28SA186  (PSEG  2009-TN2550).  Sites 
28SA179,  28SA180,  28SA181,  28SA182,  and  28SA183  are  all  multicomponent  sites  containing 
both  prehistoric  material  dating  to  the  ArchaicA/Voodland  Period  and  historic  material  dating  to 
the  18th  and  19th  centuries.  Site  28SA186  contains  material  only  from  the  18th  and  19th 
centuries.  The  New  Jersey  Historic  Preservation  Officer  stated  the  following  in  response  to 
scoping  comments:  “If  avoidance  is  not  possible,  Phase  II  archaeological  survey  will  be 
necessary  for  each  site  to  assess  their  eligibility  for  listing  on  the  National  Register  of  Historic 
Places”  (See  Appendix  D). 

The  applicant  conducted  the  Phase  II  survey  and  submitted  it  to  the  New  Jersey  SHPO 
(AKRF  2013-TN2653).  The  Phase  II  survey  found  that  the  limited  portions  of  Sites  28SA179, 
28SA180,  28SA182,  and  28SA186  that  could  be  affected  by  the  proposed  improvements  to 
Money  Island  Road  did  not  appear  to  possess  sufficient  integrity  or  significance  to  be 
considered  individually  eligible  for  the  State  or  NRHP  or  to  be  considered  eligible  as  contributing 
resources  to  either  the  Elsinboro-Lower  Alloway  Creek  Rural  Agricultural  District  or  the  John 
Mason  House.  The  New  Jersey  SHPO  recommends  that  additional  work  is  necessary  for  a 
determination  to  be  made  (NJDEP  2013-TN2742).

Dredging  Area 

A  Phase  I  survey  was  conducted  in  the  submerged  area  off  of  Artificial  Island  that  could  be 
affected  by  dredging  activities  for  the  barge  facility  and  the  water  intake  area  (PCI  2009- 
TN2544).  This  survey  identified  three  locations  that  may  represent  shipwrecks.  At  the  reguest 
of  the  New  Jersey  SHPO,  the  applicant  conducted  a  Phase  II  survey  and  determined  the 
material  appears  to  be  modern  debris  and  of  no  historical  significance  (PCI  2013-TN2749).  The 
New  Jersey  SHPO  concurred  by  letter  dated  October  28,  2013  (NJDEP  2013-TN2742)  (see 
Appendix  C).  The  USACE  has  yet  to  issue  its  determination.  Consultation  with  the  USACE  is 
ongoing. 

2.7.3  Consultation 

In  October  2010,  the  NRC  initiated  consultation  with  the  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  SHPOs,  the 
ACHP,  and  the  Native  American  tribes  listed  below.  The  letters  informed  the  consulting  parties 
that  the  NRC  is  coordinating  compliance  with  Section  1 06  of  the  NHPA  through  NEPA.  No 
Federally  recognized  tribes  are  located  within  the  state  of  New  Jersey.  However,  New  Jersey 
and  Delaware  maintain  lists  of  Tribal  groups  that  have  an  interest  in  the  region.  In

The  NRC  conducted  a  public  scoping  meeting  at  Salem  Community  College  in  Carneys  Point, 
New  Jersey,  on  November  4,  2010.  A  comment  was  received  regarding  the  new  access  road 
affecting  the  viewshed  of  the  historic  1722  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  pattern  brick  house.  The 
Swedish  Colonial  Society  commented  that  it  was  their  intention  to  discover  the  location  of  Fort 
Elfsborg,  which  had  once  stood  in  southern  New  Jersey  along  the  Delaware  River.  Although  the 
society  stated  that  it  does  not  appear  that  the  Mill  Creek  area,  where  it  is  believed  Fort  Elfsborg 
was  located,  will  be  affected,  the  society  requested  a  Phase  1  survey  of  the  area  to  ensure  that 
the  Fort  Elfsborg  historical  site  is  not  impacted,  compromised,  or  obliterated.  The  Mill  Creek 
area  where  the  society  believes  Fort  Elfsborg  is  located  is  west  of  Money  Island  Road.  Those 
portions  of  Money  Island  Road  that  would  be  affected  by  the  project  were  investigated  during 
the  archaeological  survey  conducted  for  that  portion  of  the  project.  No  evidence  of  Fort  Elfsborg 
was  discovered  during  the  archaeological  survey. 

The  New  Jersey  SHPO  provided  a  comment  during  scoping  that  it  was  currently  in  consultation 
with  the  NRC  and  other  interested  parties,  pursuant  to  Section  106  of  the  National  Historic 
Preservation  Act  (54  USC  300101  et  seq.  -TN4157).  The  NRC  also  consulted  with  the 
Delaware  SHPO.  As  discussed  in  the  visual  assessment  section  above,  the  applicant 
conducted  two  visual  assessments.  The  Delaware  SHPO  reviewed  the  reports  and  issued  a 
finding  of  “no  adverse  effect”  for  the  PSEG  ESP  project  on  any  properties  listed  on  or  eligible  for 
listing  on  the  NRHP  (DDHCA  2013-TN2639)  (see  Appendix  C).  Consultation  is  completed  with 
the  Delaware  SHPO.  The  New  Jersey  SHPO  concurred  that  there  will  be  no  effects  to  historic 
properties  from  dredging  in  the  Delaware  River  from  the  project  (NJDEP  2013-TN2742).

Likewise,  the  New  Jersey  SHPO  concurred  that  there  would  be  no  adverse  effects  to  historic 
properties  from  the  PSEG  ESP  (NJDEP  2013-TN2870).  Consultation  between  the  NRC  and  the 
New  Jersey  SHPO  was  completed  when  the  memorandum  of  agreement  (MOA)  was  executed 
between  the  consulting  parties  on  October  14,  2015  (NRC  2015-TN4377).  A  copy  of  the  final 
MOA  is  provided  within  Appendix  F.  Consultation  between  the  New  Jersey  SHPO  and  the 
USACE  is  ongoing. 

2.7.4  Post-Draft  EIS  Consultation  Activities 

On  December  4,  2014  (NJDEP  2014-TN4288),  the  NRC  received  a  revised  opinion  letter  from 
the  New  Jersey  SHPO  finding  that  the  project  would  result  in  an  adverse  effect  to  historic 
properties.  The  New  Jersey  SHPO  stated  that  the  visual  intrusion  of  two  new  NDCTs,  which 
are  included  in  the  PPE  for  the  project,  would  result  in  an  adverse  effect  to  the  Abel  and  Mary 
Nicholson  House  National  Historic  Landmark.  In  addition,  the  New  Jersey  SHPO  felt  that  the 
properties  at  349  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road  (Elsinboro  Township)  and  the  John 
Maddox  Denn  House  (1 12  Poplar  Street,  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township)  should  be 
considered  eligible  for  the  NRHP.  In  addition,  the  New  Jersey  SHPO  inquired  about  the 
consideration  given  to  identifying  paleosols  in  the  project  area. 

In  response  to  the  revised  New  Jersey  SHPO  opinion,  the  NRC  held  a  meeting  on  January  9, 
2015  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey  to  discuss  the  New  Jersey  SHPOs  concerns.  In  attendance 
at  the  meeting  were  representatives  from  the  New  Jersey  SHPO,  the  USACE,  PSEG,  AKRF 
(PSEG’s  contractor  who  conducted  the  historic  preservation  assessments  for  the  DEIS),  and  a 
local  historic  preservation  advocate  for  the  region.  Invited,  but  unable  to  attend,  was  the 
president  of  the  Salem  Old  House  Foundation.  During  the  site  visit,  all  of  the  properties  of 
concern  identified  by  the  New  Jersey  SHPO  were  visited  (i.e.,  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson 
House,  349  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road,  and  the  John  Maddox  Denn  House)  as  was 
the  project  location  for  the  Money  Island  Access  Road  project — specifically  the  Mason- 
Waddington  House  at  130  Money  Island  Road.  Figure  2-30  and  Figure  2-31  are  views  toward 
the  existing  HCGS  NDCT  from  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  NHL.  In  addition,  a  property  at  1 16 
Mason  Point  Road  was  identified  as  having  potential  for  historic  significance.  During  the 
meeting,  the  NRC  asked  if  the  2009  PSEG  report  on  paleosols  (PSEG  2015-TN4280) 
adequately  addressed  the  SHPOs  concern  on  that  matter.  A  representative  from  the  New 
Jersey  SHPO  stated  that  the  PSEG  report  adequately  addressed  paleosols  in  the  proposed 
project  area. 

The  consensus  from  the  January  9,  2015  meeting  was  that  additional  research  was  needed  to 
adequately  consider  the  effects  from  the  project.  Between  January  and  June  2015,  the  NRC 
met  with  the  New  Jersey  SHPO,  the  ACHP,  the  NPS,  interested  members  of  the  public,  and 
PSEG  to  discuss  the  effects  from  the  proposed  project  and  to  develop  possible  mitigation 
strategies  for  any  potential  effects.  Meetings  were  held  on:  January  9,  2015  in  Salem  County, 
New  Jersey;  February  12,  2015  in  Trenton,  New  Jersey;  March  26,  2015  in  Trenton,  New 
Jersey;  April  23,  2015  in  Trenton,  New  Jersey;  and  May  19,  2015  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey. 
Publicly  noticed  teleconferences  were  held  on  June  16,  2015  and  August  12,  2015  (NRC  2015- 
TN4368).

In  May  2015,  AKRF  issued  a  new  historic  assessment  which  considered  the  NRHP  eligibility  of 
the  properties  identified  by  the  New  Jersey  SHPO  and  the  potential  visual  effects  from  the 
project  on  historic  properties  (AKRF  2015-TN4287).  The  assessment  considered  four 
properties:  (i.e. ,  116  Mason  Point  Road,  the  Isaac  Smart  House  [489  Salem-Fort  Elfsborg 
Road],  349  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road,  and  the  Joseph  Darkin  House  [85  Amwellbury 
Road]).  All  other  properties  were  examined  in  previous  reports  conducted  for  the  proposed 
project  (MACTEC  2009-TN2543;  AKRF  2012-TN2876).  The  findings  were  presented  at  a 
consultation  meeting  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey  on  May  19,  2015.  In  attendance  were 
representatives  from  the  NRC,  the  New  Jersey  SHPO,  ACHP,  PSEG,  NPS,  and  interested 
members  of  the  public.  Per  36  CFR  800.10(c),  the  NRC  officially  notified  the  NPS  of  the 
potential  adverse  effect  to  a  NHL  (i.e.,  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House)  and  invited  NPS  to 
participate  in  consultation  by  letter  dated  June  24,  2015  (NRC  2015-TN4292).  The  AKRF  report 
(AKRF  201 5-TN4287)  found  that  the  two  proposed  NDCTs  in  the  PPE  for  the  ESP  would  only 
be  visible  from  the  following  properties:  349  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road  and  116 
Mason  Point  Road  (AKRF  201 5-TN4287).  In  addition,  as  established  in  the  January  9,  2015 
meeting,  the  two  proposed  NDCTs  from  the  ESP  PPE  would  also  be  visible  from  the  Abel  and 
Mary  Nicholson  House. 

Based  on  the  information  contained  in  the  AKRF  report  (AKRF  2015-TN4287)  and  the  site  visits 
and  meetings  which  occurred  between  January  and  June  2015,  the  NRC  issued  letters  on  June 
24,  2015  to  the  New  Jersey  SHPO  (NRC  2015-TN4290),  the  ACHP  (NRC  2015-TN4291 ),  and 
the  NPS  (NRC  2015-TN4292)  stating  its  determination  that  the  project  would  result  in  an  indirect 
visual  adverse  effect  on  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House  NHL,  the  property  at  349  Fort

TN4290;  NRC  2015-TN4291;  and  NRC  2015-TN4292,  respectively).  The  NRC  indicated  in  its 
letter  that  a  MOA  was  in  development  identifying  how  the  adverse  effect  to  these  three 
properties  would  be  resolved.  In  response,  the  ACHP  (ACHP-2015-TN4341 )  and  New  Jersey 
SHPO  (New  Jersey  SHPO-2015-TN4342)  agreed  to  participate  in  the  development  of  the  draft 
MOA.  On  September  4,  2015,  the  draft  MOA  was  issued  for  public  comment  in  Federal 
Register  (80  FR  53579-TN4344).  The  MOA  was  executed  on  October  14,  2015  (NRC  2015- 
TN4377),  thereby  completing  Section  106  consultation  for  the  proposed  action. 

2.8  Geology 

The  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  provides  a  description  of  the  geological,  seismological, 
and  geotechnical  conditions  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  site  lies  within  the  coastal  plain 
physiographic  province,  which  extends  from  the  Fall  Line  eastward  to  the  Atlantic  Ocean. 
Through  the  Fall  Line,  the  larger  streams  cascade  off  the  resistant  igneous  and  metamorphic 
rocks  down  to  sea  level.  Large  tidal  rivers,  such  as  the  Delaware,  flow  southeastward  across 
the  coastal  plain  to  the  Atlantic  Ocean.  The  topography  of  the  coastal  plain  is  a  terraced 
landscape  that  gently  stair-steps  down  to  the  coast  and  to  the  major  rivers.  The  risers  are 
former  shorelines,  and  the  treads  are  emergent  bay  and  river  bottoms.  The  higher,  older  plains 
in  the  western  part  of  the  coastal  plain  are  more  dissected  by  stream  erosion  than  the  lower, 
younger  terrace  treads.  This  landscape  was  formed  over  the  last  few  million  years  as  sea  level 
rose  and  fell  in  response  to  the  repeated  melting  and  growth  of  large  continental  glaciers  and  as 
the  coastal  plain  slowly  uplifted  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  New  Jersey  coastal  plain  is  underlain  by  a  thick  wedge  of  sediments  that  increases  in 
thickness  from  a  feather  edge  near  the  Fall  Line  to  about  6,000  ft  at  the  coast  near  Cape  May, 
New  Jersey.  These  sediments  rest  on  an  eroded  surface  of  Precambrian  to  early  Mesozoic 
rock.  They  range  in  age  from  Holocene  at  the  surface  to  Cretaceous  at  depth  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  The  stratigraphic  section  for  the  PSEG  Site  is  shown  in  Figure  2-32.  This  figure 
details  the  geologic  era  and  period,  stratigraphic  unit,  lithology,  and  approximate  thickness  at 
the  PSEG  Site. 

PSEG  borings  from  the  site  identified  14  stratigraphic  layers,  most  of  which  can  be  correlated  to 
the  regional  geologic  strata.  The  stratigraphic  layers  are  grouped  into  the  following  four  time 
periods  according  to  geologic  age  (from  oldest  to  youngest): 

•  Cretaceous  (Lower  and  Upper), 

•  Paleogene  (Lower  Tertiary), 

•  Neogene  (Upper  Tertiary),  and 

•  Quaternary  (Pleistocene  and  Holocene). 

The  Lower  Cretaceous  strata  encountered  during  the  geotechnical  investigation  at  the  PSEG 
Site  is  composed  of  a  single  unit,  the  Potomac  Formation,  which  is  recognized  in  only  the 
deepest  borings  performed  at  the  PSEG  Site.  This  unit  forms  the  base  of  the  shallow 
subsurface  (less  than  500  ft)  profile  at  the  site.  The  borings  at  the  PSEG  Site  were  not  deep 
enough  to  determine  the  depth  of  the  Potomac  Formation  at  the  site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

Formation  has  been  eroded  from  the  site  and  identify  the  sediments  above 
the  Vincentown  Formation  as  belonging  to  the  Pleistocene-aged  Cape  May

The  Upper  Cretaceous  strata  encountered  during  the  geotechnical  investigation  at  the  PSEG 
Site  is  composed  of  the  following  eight  formations,  listed  from  oldest  to  youngest: 

•  Magothy  Formation, 

•  Merchantville  Formation,

Affected  Environment 


•  Woodbury  Formation, 

•  Englishtown  Formation, 

•  Marshalltown  Formation, 

•  Wenonah  Formation, 

•  Mount  Laurel  Formation,  and 

•  Navesink  Formation. 

The  Paleogene  strata  (Lower  Tertiary)  encountered  during  the  investigation  at  the  PSEG  Site  is 
composed  of  two  formations,  listed  from  oldest  to  youngest: 

•  Hornerstown  Formation  and 

•  Vincentown  Formation. 

As  shown  in  Figure  2-32,  the  sediments  overlying  the  Vincentown  Formation  encountered 
during  the  geotechnical  investigation  at  the  PSEG  Site  were  identified  in  the  ER  and  SSAR  as 
the  Kirkwood  Formation  (Upper  Tertiary),  subdivided  into  upper  and  lower  units  based  on 
variations  in  lithology  and  the  alluvium  (Quaternary)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2015- 
TN4283).  Recent  studies  indicate  that  the  Kirkwood  Formation  was  eroded  from  the  PSEG  Site 
during  the  Pleistocene  and  identify  the  sediments  overlying  the  Vincentown  Formation  at 
Artificial  Island  as  belonging  to  the  Cape  May  Formation  (Quaternary)  (Owens  &  Minard  1979- 
TN4189;  Stanford  201 1-TN4192).  According  to  New  Jersey  bedrock  and  surficial  geology 
maps,  the  Kirkwood  Formation  occurs  east  of  Artificial  Island  (Owens  et  al.  1998-TN4190; 

Newell  et  al.  2000-TN4191 ). 

The  uppermost  sediments  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  artificial  and  hydraulic  fill. 

The  thickness  and  depth  to  the  tops  of  each  layer  and  the  hydraulic  characteristics  are 
discussed  in  Section  2.3  of  this  EIS. 

2.9  Meteorology  and  Air  Quality 

The  area  surrounding  the  PSEG  Site  is  a  continental  climate  and  includes  extremes,  but 
because  of  the  proximity  of  the  Delaware  Bay,  the  site  experiences  a  coastal  marine  influence. 
Elevations  in  the  southwest  portion  of  New  Jersey  are  between  sea  level  and  30.5  m  (100  ft) 
above  sea  level.  The  southwest  region  of  New  Jersey  is  the  warmest  and  driest  part  of  the 
state.  In  the  southwest  region,  prevailing  winds  vary  depending  on  the  orientation  and  distance 
to  water  bodies,  except  for  the  predominance  of  west-to-northwest  (rotating  clockwise)  winds  in 
winter.  High  humidity  is  common  in  this  portion  of  New  Jersey,  and  moderate  temperatures 
prevail  when  winds  flow  from  the  south  or  the  east.  As  described  above,  elevation  variations  at 
the  southern  end  of  the  state,  including  the  PSEG  Site  region,  are  minor.  Therefore,  the  primary 
remaining  factors  that  control  local  variation  of  the  continental  climate  in  the  region  are  the 
moderating  influences  of  the  Delaware  Bay  and  Atlantic  Ocean  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).

2.9.1  Climate 

2.9.1. 1  Wind 

The  PSEG  Site  lies  within  the  very  broad,  midlatitude  prevailing  westerly  wind  belt.  There  is 
some  variation  of  prevailing  winds  across  southern  New  Jersey  from  the  Atlantic  Ocean 
shoreline  to  the  Delaware  River  Valley.  During  the  2006  to  2008  period,  the  prevailing  annual 
wind  direction  for  the  site  was  from  the  northwest  (continental  polar  air  mass)  and  accounted  for 
about  1 1  percent  of  the  time.  There  was  also  a  secondary  maximum  from  the  southeast 
(Delaware  Bay  breeze),  which  accounted  for  about  9  percent  of  the  time.  Winds  from  the 
northwest  predominate  during  the  winter  months;  southeasterly  winds  predominate  followed  by 
northwesterly  winds  during  the  spring  months;  and  the  winds  from  minor  directions  show 
somewhat  higher  frequencies  than  prevailing  northwest-southeast  directions  during  the  summer 
and  autumn  months.  No  calm  winds  were  recorded  at  the  site  because  of  the  sensitivity  of  the 
onsite  sonic  wind  sensor  and  the  open  exposure  of  the  flat  terrain  and  Delaware  Bay  (PSEG 
2015-TN4283). 

2. 9. 1.2  T emperature 

The  area  surrounding  the  PSEG  Site  is  characterized  by  normal  and  extreme  temperatures 
based  on  10  representative  surrounding  observation  stations.  The  extreme  maximum 
temperature  recorded  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site  is  108°F  at  the  Marcus  Hook,  Pennsylvania, 
cooperative  monitoring  station  26  mi  to  the  north-northeast  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  extreme 
minimum  temperature  recorded  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site  is  -15°F  at  Millington,  Maryland,  located 
23  mi  to  the  southwest  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Because  of  its  location  near  the  Delaware  Bay,  the 
PSEG  Site  typically  experiences  temperatures  that  are  more  moderate  than  the  cooperative 
monitoring  stations  located  farther  inland  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283). 

2. 9. 1.3  Atmospheric  Water  Vapor 

Wet-bulb  temperature,  dew  point  temperature,  and  relative  humidity  data  summaries  were 
determined  from  the  Wilmington,  Delaware,  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  observation 
station  to  characterize  the  typical  atmospheric  moisture  conditions  near  the  PSEG  Site. 

For  a  25-year  period  of  record,  the  mean  annual  wet-bulb  temperature  was  48.9°F  at  the 
Wilmington,  Delaware,  NWS  site.  The  highest  monthly  mean  wet-bulb  temperature  was 
69.0°F  during  July,  and  the  lowest  monthly  mean  wet-bulb  temperature  was  29.0°F  during 
January.  The  mean  annual  dew  point  temperature  was  44.6°F  at  Wilmington,  which  also 
reaches  its  maximum  during  summer  and  minimum  during  winter.  The  highest  monthly  mean 
dew  point  temperature  was  66.1  °F  during  July,  and  the  lowest  monthly  mean  dew  point 
temperature  was  24.1°F  during  January  (PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

Based  on  a  30-year  period  of  record  from  the  data  recorded  at  the  Wilmington,  Delaware,  NWS 
site,  the  relative  humidity  averages  68  percent  on  an  annual  basis.  The  average  nighttime 
(at  0100  local  standard  time  [LST])  relative  humidity  levels  exceed  80  percent  from  June 
through  October.  Typically,  the  relative  humidity  values  reach  their  diurnal  maximum  in  the 
early  morning  (at  0700  LST)  and  diurnal  minimum  during  the  early  afternoon  (at  1300  LST) 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4283).

2. 9. 1.4  Precipitation 

Based  on  data  from  the  surrounding  monitoring  stations,  the  mean  annual  total  rainfall  for  the 
PSEG  Site  area  ranges  from  36.04  in.  at  the  site  to  46.28  in.  at  Dover,  Delaware.  The  mean 
annual  snowfall  recorded  at  the  surrounding  stations  ranges  from  7.5  in.  at  Glassboro,  New 
Jersey,  located  26  mi  to  the  northeast  to  19.3  in.  at  the  Philadelphia  International  Airport, 
located  30  mi  to  the  north-northeast.  The  maximum  recorded  24-hour  snowfall  of  30.7  in.  was 
measured  on  January  8,  1996,  at  the  Marcus  Hook  monitoring  station,  located  about  26  mi 
north-northeast  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  highest  24-hour  rainfall  total  in  the  area  was  1 1 .68  in. 
on  September  16,  1999,  at  the  Marcus  Hook,  Pennsylvania,  monitoring  station.  The  highest 
monthly  rainfall  total  in  the  site  area  was  16.13  in.,  recorded  during  September  1999  at  the 
same  monitoring  station.  The  maximum  monthly  snowfall  from  records  for  regional  stations  is 
40.0  in.  at  Hammonton,  New  Jersey,  during  February  1899  (PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

The  estimated  weight  of  the  100-year  return  period  ground  level  snowpack  for  the  PSEG  Site  is 
about  24  lb/ft2.  The  48-hour  probable  maximum  winter  precipitation  is  21  in.  of  water,  which 
corresponds  to  109  lb/ft2  (PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

2. 9. 1.5  Severe  Weather 
Thunderstorms  and  Lightning 

On  average,  approximately  28  days  with  thunderstorm  occurrences  happen  per  year  at  the 
Wilmington,  Delaware,  reporting  station.  The  majority  of  the  storms  recorded  (73  percent) 
occurred  between  May  and  August.  The  frequency  of  lightning  strikes  to  earth  per  square  mile 
per  year  is  approximately  8.6  for  the  PSEG  Site  and  surrounding  area.  The  power  block  area  of 
a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  an  area  of  approximately  70  ac  or  0.1 1  mi2. 

Given  the  annual  average  lightning  strike  to  earth  frequency  of  8.6  per  mi2/yr,  the  frequency  of 
lightning  strikes  in  the  power  block  area  is  about  one  strike  per  year  (PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

Extreme  Winds 

Basic  wind  speed  is  used  for  design  and  operating  bases.  Basic  wind  speed  is  defined  by  the 
American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers/Structural  Engineering  Institute  (ASCE/SEI)  7-05, 

“Minimum  Design  Loads  for  Buildings  and  Other  Structures,”  as  the  “3-second  gust  wind  speed 
at  33  ft  (10  m)  above  the  ground  in  Exposure  Category  C.”  Exposure  Category  C  relies  on  the 
surface  roughness  categories  as  defined  in  Chapter  6,  “Wind  Loads,”  of  ASCE/SEI  7-05. 
Exposure  Category  C  is  acceptable  at  the  PSEG  Site  because  of  scattered  obstructions  of 
various  sizes  in  the  immediate  site  area.  Exposure  Category  B  specifies  that  there  must  be 
“urban  and  suburban  areas,  wooded  areas,  or  other  terrain  with  numerous  closely  spaced 
obstructions  having  the  size  of  single-family  dwellings  or  larger”  prevailing  “in  the  upwind 
direction  for  a  distance  of  at  least  2,600  ft  (792  m)  or  20  times  the  height  of  the  building, 
whichever  is  greater.”  Neither  Exposure  Category  B  nor  Exposure  Category  D  accurately 
describes  the  conditions  at  the  PSEG  meteorological  tower.  The  basic  wind  speed  for  the 
PSEG  Site  is  90  mph,  based  on  the  plot  of  basic  wind  speeds  in  Figure  6-1 C  of  ASCE/SEI  7-05. 
Basic  wind  speeds  reported  for  hourly  weather  monitoring  stations  in  the  site  area  are  as 
follows:  100  mph  for  Dover  Air  Force  Base,  Delaware;  110  mph  for  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania; 


NUREG-2168 


2-174

Affected  Environment 


and  100  mph  for  Wilmington,  Delaware.  Therefore,  the  highest  of  the  four  basic  wind  speed 
values  selected  is  1 10  mph  for  the  return  period,  which  is  determined  by  multiplying  the  50-year 
return  period  value  by  a  factor  of  1.07,  listed  in  ASCE/SEI  7-05.  That  approach  produced  a 
100-year  return  period  3-second  gust  wind  speed  for  the  PSEG  Site  area  of  1 17.7  mph  (PSEG 
2015-TN4283). 

Tornadoes 

Total  tornadoes  and  waterspouts  recorded  in  a  surrounding  8-county  area  (New  Castle  and 
Kent  in  Delaware;  Cumberland,  Salem,  and  Gloucester  in  New  Jersey;  and  Queen  Anne’s, 

Kent,  and  Cecil  in  Maryland)  during  a  nearly  60-year  period  of  record  were  82  and  1, 
respectively.  The  strongest  tornadoes  found  in  the  database  for  Salem  County,  New  Jersey, 
were  both  rated  F2.  The  first  F2  tornado  occurred  on  July  14,  1960,  and  damaged  or  destroyed 
several  rural  and  residential  structures.  The  tornado  had  a  path  length  of  8  mi  and  a  width  of 
450  yd.  The  second  F2  tornado  in  Salem  County  occurred  on  August  17,  1988,  and  had  a  path 
length  of  2  mi  and  a  width  of  400  yards.  The  strongest  tornado  found  in  the  database  for  New 
Castle  County,  Delaware,  is  rated  F3  and  occurred  on  April  28,  1961.  That  storm  damaged  a 
warehouse  and  had  a  path  length  of  0.25  mi  and  a  width  of  30  yd  (PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

Per  Regulatory  Guide  1.76  (NRC  2007-TN3294),  the  site  is  located  in  tornado-intensity 
Region  II,  for  which  design  basis  tornado  characteristics  are  presented  in  the  following.  The 
maximum  wind  speed  resulting  from  passage  of  a  tornado  having  a  probability  of  occurrence  of 
1 0-7  per  year  is  200  mph.  The  translation  and  rotation  components  of  the  maximum  tornado 
wind  speed  are  40  mph  and  1 60  mph,  respectively.  The  distance  from  the  center  of  the  tornado 
at  which  the  maximum  rotational  wind  speed  occurs  is  150  ft.  The  maximum  pressure  drop 
from  normal  atmospheric  pressure  resulting  from  passage  of  the  tornado  is  0.9  psi,  and  the  rate 
of  pressure  drop  is  0.4  psi/s  (PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

Hail,  Snowstorms,  and  Ice  Storms 

Hail  can  accompany  severe  thunderstorms  and  can  be  a  major  weather  hazard,  causing 
significant  damage  to  crops  and  property.  Hail  events  have  increased  significantly  over  time, 
primarily  as  a  result  of  increased  reporting  efficiency  and  confirmation  skill.  This  increase  in  hail 
reports  is  also  likely  caused  by  the  increased  number  of  targets  because  of  urbanization.  This 
is  because  there  are  more  targets  damaged  by  hail  in  urban  areas  than  in  rural  areas. 

Estimates  of  hail  size  can  range  widely  based  on  the  surrounding  area’s  population  density  and 
the  years  considered.  The  NOAA  “Climate  Atlas  of  the  United  States”  was  used  to  estimate  that 
the  annual  mean  number  of  days  with  hail  1 .0  in.  or  greater  in  diameter  is  approximately  0.5  per 
year  at  the  PSEG  Site.  During  the  60-year  period  covered  in  the  NOAA  reference,  large  hail 
events  (i.e.,  those  with  hail  having  a  diameter  greater  than  1 .75  in.)  occurred  on  three  occasions 
each  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  and  New  Castle  County,  Delaware  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283). 

On  average  during  the  period  from  1961  to  1990,  snowfall  occurred  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  within 
the  surrounding  area  during  2.5  to  5.4  days  per  year.  Freezing  precipitation  occurred  in  the  site 
area  on  an  average  of  5.5  to  10.4  days  per  year.  Annual  snowfall  is  highly  variable  across  the 
region  and  ranges  from  10  in.  to  50  in.  Occasionally,  these  snow  events  are  accompanied  by, 
or  alternate  with,  sleet  and  freezing  rain  as  the  weather  system  moves  over  the  area.  As 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Affected  Environment 


discussed  in  Section  2.9.1 .4,  the  largest  recorded  daily  snowfall  for  the  site  climate  region  is 
30.7  in.  at  Marcus  Hook,  Pennsylvania,  on  January  8,  1996.  The  highest  monthly  total  of 
40.0  in.  occurred  at  Hammonton,  New  Jersey,  during  February  1899  (PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

Weather  records  for  Salem  County,  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle  County,  Delaware  indicate  that 
freezing  precipitation  events  tend  to  occur  each  year.  Based  on  the  period  of  1950  through  the 
winter  of  2008-2009,  the  maximum  thicknesses  of  ice  accumulation  are  typically  0.1  or  0.2  in. 
The  maximum  observed  ice  thickness  in  the  two  counties  was  about  0.5  in.  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4283). 

Tropical  Cyclones 

According  to  the  National  Hurricane  Center  online  historical  database,  between  1851  and 
2008,  1 09  tropical  cyclone  centers  passed  within  a  1 1 5-mi  radius  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Of  the 
109  tropical  cyclone  centers,  31  were  extra-tropical  depressions,  9  were  tropical  depressions, 

60  were  tropical  storms,  6  were  Category  1  hurricanes,  and  3  were  Category  2  hurricanes 
(PSEG  2015-TN4283).  Tropical  cyclones  have  occurred  within  this  area  as  early  as  May  and  as 
late  as  November.  The  highest  frequency  of  storms  occurs  during  September  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4283). 

Most  recently,  Hurricane  Sandy  came  through  the  PSEG  Site  in  Salem  County  on 
October  29,  2012,  bringing  heavy  rain  and  wind  and  causing  severe  flooding  throughout  New 
Jersey,  Delaware,  New  York,  and  nearby  areas.  This  storm  resulted  in  PSEG  workers  requiring 
several  days  to  restore  power  caused  by  damage  to  transmission  systems  (Gopinath  2012- 
TN3375). 

2.9. 1.6  A  tmospheric  Stability 

Stability  class  is  based  on  the  HCGS  and  SGS  onsite  primary  meteorological  tower  150-33  ft 
vertical  temperature  difference  (delta-T),  and  winds  are  based  on  33-ft  level  measurements 
(PSEG  2015-TN4283).  Table  2.3-27  in  the  PSEG  SSAR  (PSEG  2015-TN4283)  provides  the 
annual  mean  joint  frequency  distributions  of  wind  direction  and  wind  speed  versus  Pasquill 
atmospheric  stability  class  for  the  period  2006  to  2008.  Atmospheric  stability  is  a  critical 
parameter  for  estimating  atmospheric  dispersion  characteristics. 

There  is  a  predominance  of  slightly  stable  (Pasquill  stability  class  E)  and  neutral  (Pasquill 
stability  class  D)  conditions  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site.  Extremely  unstable  conditions  (Pasquill 
stability  class  A)  occur  about  12  percent  of  the  time,  while  extremely  stable  conditions  (Pasquill 
stability  class  G)  occur  about  7  percent  of  the  time.  Based  on  past  experience  with  stability  data 
at  various  sites,  a  predominance  of  slightly  stable  (Pasquill  stability  class  E)  and  neutral 
(Pasquill  stability  class  D)  conditions  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  is  generally  consistent  with 
expected  meteorological  conditions  (PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

2.9.2  Air  Quality 

The  discussion  of  air  quality  includes  the  six  common  “criteria  pollutants”  for  which  the  EPA  has 
set  National  Ambient  Air  Quality  Standards  (NAAQS)  (EPA  2013-TN1975):  ozone  (O3), 
particulate  matter  (PM10  and  PM2  5,  which  are  particulate  matter  with  a  mean  aerodynamic

diameter  of  less  than  or  equal  to  10  pm  and  2.5  pm,  respectively),  carbon  monoxide  (CO), 
nitrogen  dioxide  (NO2),  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2),  and  lead  (Pb).  The  air-quality  discussion  also 
includes  heat-trapping  greenhouse  gases  (GHGs),  primarily  carbon  dioxide  (CO2),  which  have 
been  the  principal  factor  causing  climate  change  over  the  last  50  years  (GCRP  2014-TN3472). 

The  EPA  designated  the  entire  state  of  New  Jersey  as  nonattainment  for  the  8-hour  O3  NAAQS 
(NJDEP  2013-TN2493).  Every  county  in  New  Jersey  is  part  of  a  multi-State  nonattainment 
area,  separated  into  northern  and  southern  counties.  The  northern  New  Jersey  counties  are 
part  of  the  New  York-Northern  New  Jersey-Long  Island  (NY-NJ-CT)  nonattainment  area,  and 
the  southern  New  Jersey  counties  are  part  of  the  Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic  City  (PA-NJ- 
MD-DE)  nonattainment  area  (NJDEP  201 3-TN2493).  The  PSEG  Site  is  located  in  Salem 
County,  New  Jersey.  Salem  County  is  in  the  PA-NJ-MD-DE  nonattainment  area  for  8-hour  O3 
NAAQS  (40  CFR  81.331  [TN255])  and  administratively  in  the  Metropolitan  Philadelphia 
Interstate  Air  Quality  Control  Region  (40  CFR  81.15  [TN255]).  With  the  exception  of  the  8-hour 
O3  NAAQS,  air  quality  in  Salem  County  is  in  attainment  with  or  better  than  national  standards  for 
criteria  pollutants.  Emissions  from  new  sources  in  attainment  areas  are  evaluated  by  the  State 
of  New  Jersey  through  the  Prevention  of  Significant  Deterioration  program.  In  nonattainment 
areas,  the  emissions  of  pollutants  that  are  precursors  to  O3  are  regulated  by  the  State  of  New 
Jersey.  The  primary  precursors  to  O3  are  oxides  of  nitrogen  (NOx)  and  volatile  organic 
compounds  (VOCs).  In  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  evaluation  of  new  sources  in  nonattainment 
areas  is  through  the  nonattainment  New  Source  Review  program  (NJAC  7:27-TN3290). 

New  Castle  County,  Delaware,  which  is  located  to  the  north  and  west  of  the  PSEG  Site,  is  in 
attainment  for  all  criteria  pollutants  except  the  8-hour  03  NAAQS  (40  CFR  81 .308  [TN255]). 
Along  with  Salem  County,  New  Castle  County  is  also  in  the  PA-NJ-MD-DE  nonattainment  area. 
Effective  September  4,  2014,  New  Castle  County  was  redesignated  from  nonattainment  area  to 
maintenance  area  for  the  PM2.5  NAAQS  (79  FR  45350-TN4293). 

The  closest  mandatory  Class  I  Federal  area  to  the  PSEG  Site  is  Brigantine  Wilderness  Area  at 
the  Edwin  B.  Forsythe  National  Wildlife  Refuge  north  of  Brigantine,  New  Jersey,  about  60  mi 
east  of  the  PSEG  Site  (40  CFR  81 .420  [TN255]).  Federal  Class  I  areas  are  afforded  additional 
protection  under  Section  1 69A  of  the  Clean  Air  Act  (42  USC  7401  et  seq.  -TN1 141 )  for  visibility 
criteria. 

Climate  changes  are  under  way  in  the  United  States  and  globally,  and  their  extent  is  projected 
to  continue  to  grow  substantially  over  the  next  several  decades  unless  concerted  measures  are 
taken  to  reverse  this  trend.  Climate-related  changes  include  rising  temperatures  and  sea  levels; 
increased  frequency  and  intensity  of  extreme  weather  (e.g.,  heavy  downpours,  floods,  and 
droughts);  earlier  snowmelts  and  associated  frequent  wildfires;  and  reduced  snow  cover, 
glaciers,  permafrost,  and  sea  ice.  Climate  changes  are  closely  linked  to  increases  in  GHGs 
(GCRP  2014-TN3472).  GHGs  are  transparent  to  incoming  short-wave  radiation  from  the  sun 
but  are  opaque  to  outgoing  long-wave  (infrared)  radiation  from  the  earth  s  surface.  The  net 
effect  over  time  is  a  trapping  of  absorbed  radiation  and  a  tendency  to  warm  the  earth’s 
atmosphere,  which  together  constitute  the  "greenhouse  effect.’  Since  the  onset  of  the  Industrial 
Revolution  in  the  mid-1700s,  human  activities  have  contributed  to  the  production  of  GHGs, 
primarily  through  the  combustion  of  fossil  fuels  (such  as  coal,  oil,  and  natural  gas)  and 
deforestation.  The  principal  GHGs  that  enter  the  atmosphere  because  of  human  activities 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Affected  Environment 


include  CO2,  methane  (ChU),  nitrous  oxide  (N2O),  hydrofluorocarbons,  perfluorocarbons,  and 
sulfur  hexafluoride.  However,  some  GHGs  such  as  CO2,  CH4,  and  N2O  are  emitted  to  the 
atmosphere  through  natural  processes  as  well. 

2.9.3  Atmospheric  Dispersion 

Projected  Air  Quality 

Generation  of  electricity  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  be  a  source 
of  criteria  pollutants.  However,  supporting  equipment  such  as  cooling  towers,  auxiliary  boilers, 
emergency  diesel  generators,  and/or  combustion  turbines  would  emit  criteria  pollutants.  Air- 
quality  impacts  of  these  sources  are  discussed  in  Section  5.7.  Impacts  of  air  emissions  during 
development  of  the  PSEG  Site  are  discussed  in  Section  4.7. 

Restrictive  Dispersion  Conditions 

Stagnation  conditions,  which  restrict  the  atmospheric  dispersion  and  can  contribute  to  pollution 
episodes,  occur  at  the  PSEG  Site  approximately  1 1  days  per  year  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  The 
potential  for  air  pollution  also  is  related  to  atmospheric  mixing  heights  and  wind  speeds  through 
the  mixing  layer  (Holzworth  1972-TN3024).  Table  2-38  summarizes  approximate  mean 
seasonal  and  annual  morning  and  afternoon  mixing  heights.  Lowest  morning  mixing  heights 
occur  during  summer,  and  highest  morning  mixing  heights  occur  during  winter.  Afternoon 
mixing  heights  are  lowest  during  winter  and  highest  during  summer.  Lowest  mean  wind  speeds 
occur  during  summer  mornings,  while  highest  mean  wind  speeds  occur  during  spring 
afternoons.

Short-  and  Long-Term  Dispersion  Estimates  from  Power  Plant  Operation 

Atmospheric  dispersion  consists  of  two  components:  (1 )  atmospheric  transport  due  to 
organized  or  mean  wind  flow  in  the  atmosphere  and  (2)  atmospheric  diffusion  due  to 
disorganized  or  random  air  movements.  The  magnitude  of  the  atmospheric  dispersion  is  a 
function  of  the  wind  speed,  wind  direction,  and  atmospheric  stability  class.  The  lower  the 
alphabetic  atmospheric  class  designation  (Class  A)  in  NRC  Regulatory  Guide  1.145 
(NRC  1983-TN279),  the  more  unstable  the  atmosphere  and  the  more  rapid  the  atmospheric

dispersion.  The  air-quality  analyses  for  emissions  from  supporting  facilities  (e.g.,  boilers  and 
diesel  generators)  are  described  in  Section  5.7. 

2. 9. 3. 7  Short-  Term  Dispersion  Estimates 

PSEG  calculated  short-term  dispersion  estimates  using  3  years  of  onsite  meteorological  data 
(January  1, 2006,  through  December  31, 2008).  These  estimates  were  based  on  distances  to 
the  exclusion  area  boundary  (EAB)  and  outer  boundary  of  the  low  population  zone  (LPZ)  as 
defined  in  Section  2  of  the  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  NRC  staffs  short-term  dispersion  estimates  for  use  in  design  basis  accident  calculations 
are  listed  in  Table  2-39.  They  are  based  on  the  PAVAN  computer  code  (Bander  1982-TN538) 
calculations  of  1-hour  and  annual  average  atmospheric  dispersion  (x/Q)  values  from  a  joint 
frequency  distribution  of  wind  speed,  wind  direction,  and  atmospheric  stability.  These  values 
were  calculated  for  the  shortest  distances  from  a  release  boundary  envelope  that  encloses  the 
PSEG  Unit  1  or  Unit  2  release  points  to  the  EAB  and  to  the  LPZ.  The  50  percent  EAB  x/Q  value 
listed  in  Table  2-39  is  the  median  1-hour  y/Q,  which  is  assumed  to  persist  for  2  hours.  The 
50  percent  LPZ  y/Q  values  listed  in  Table  2-39  were  determined  by  logarithmic  interpolation 
between  the  median  1-hour  y/Q,  which  was  assumed  to  persist  for  2  hours,  and  the  annual 
average  y/Q  following  the  procedure  described  in  NRC  Regulatory  Guide  1.145  (NRC  1983- 
TN279).

2. 9.3.2  L  ong-  T erm  Dispersion  Estimates 

Long-term  dispersion  estimates  for  use  in  evaluation  of  the  radiological  impacts  of  normal 
operations  were  calculated  by  PSEG  using  the  XOQDOQ  computer  code  (Sagendorf  et  al. 
1982-TN280)  and  3  years  of  onsite  meteorological  data  (January  1,  2006,  through  December 
31 ,  2008)  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283).  This  code  implements  the  guidance  set  forth  in  Revision  1  of 
NRC  Regulatory  Guide  1.111  (NRC  1977-TN91 )  for  estimation  of  y/Q  and  deposition  factors 
(D/Q)  for  use  in  evaluation  of  the  consequences  of  normal  reactor  operations.  The  results  of  the 
PSEG  calculations  are  presented  in  Table  2-40  for  receptors  of  interest,  including  the  nearest

2.9.4  Meteorological  Monitoring 

The  PSEG  Site  consists  of  819  ac  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  on  the  east 
bank  of  the  Delaware  River.  The  existing  PSEG  meteorological  tower  is  located  due  east  of 
SGS  and  southeast  of  the  proposed  location  of  the  power  block  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site.  The  surrounding  terrain  is  essentially  mixed  marsh,  cropland,  and  woodland 
with  only  an  occasional  grouping  of  low  trees.  Distances  between  the  existing  meteorological 
tower  and  significant  features  in  the  area  are  as  follows  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283): 

•  5,470  ft  southeast  of  the  power  block  area  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site, 

•  at  least  4,500  ft  from  the  SGS  and  HCGS  reactor  buildings, 

•  4,700  ft  southeast  of  the  existing  512-ft  tall  NDCT  at  HCGS, 

•  6,800  ft  southeast  of  the  cooling  towers  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  and 

•  about  1,180  ft  due  north  of  the  closest  portion  of  the  Delaware  Bay. 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  on  Artificial  Island,  a  human-made  portion  of  land  that  is  relatively  flat 
(Figure  2-33).  There  are  no  discernible  changes  in  elevation  or  vegetation  near  the 
meteorological  tower  that  would  adversely  affect  meteorological  measurements.  The  elevation 
of  the  meteorological  tower  is  1 1 .9  ft  NAVD.  The  site  grade  elevation  for  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  expected  to  be  36.9  ft  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283). 

The  meteorological  tower  is  a  300-ft  guyed,  triangular,  open-lattice  tower  with  a  solid  cement 
base.  As  shown  in  Figure  2-34  and  Figure  2-35,  instrumentation  booms  extend  outward  into  the 
prevailing  wind,  which  is  from  the  northwest.  The  sensors  are  mounted  on  the  booms  at 
distances  equal  to  more  than  twice  the  tower  maximum  horizontal  width.  Ground  cover  around 
the  tower  is  light  colored  gravel  surrounded  by  low-lying  marsh  land.  There  are  no  trees  of  any 
consequence  in  the  tower  vicinity  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).

PSEG  maintains  a  backup  meteorological  tower  consisting  of  a  33-ft  utility  pole  (seen  in 
foreground  of  Figure  2-34).  This  backup  tower  is  located  386  ft  south  of  the  primary  tower  and 
is  surrounded  by  vegetation  and  gravel  similar  to  that  surrounding  the  primary  tower  (PSEG 
2015-TN4283). 

2. 9. 4. 7  Instrumentation 

The  instrumentation  on  the  existing  meteorological  tower  is  as  follows  (PSEG  2015-TN4283): 

•  300-ft  level — wind  speed  and  direction,  sigma  theta,  300-33  ft  delta  temperature,  dry  bulb 
temperature,  and  relative  humidity; 

•  197-ft  level — wind  speed  and  direction,  sigma  theta,  and  197-33  ft  delta  temperature; 

•  150-ft  level — wind  speed  and  direction,  sigma  theta,  and  150-33  ft  delta  temperature; 

•  33-ft  level — wind  speed  and  direction,  sigma  theta,  dry  bulb  temperature,  dew  point 
temperature,  and  relative  humidity; 

•  surface — barometric  pressure,  precipitation,  and  solar  radiation;  and 

•  backup  tower  (33  ft) — wind  speed  and  direction  and  sigma  theta. 

The  meteorological  monitoring  system  uses  a  Met  One  instrumentation  package  and  data 
recording  system  located  in  a  12-ft  high  meteorological  building  adjacent  to  the  tower,  as  seen 
in  Figure  2-34.  The  data  recording  system  is  a  state-of-the-art  digital  system  with  displays  in  the 
meteorological  building.  The  wind  speed  and  direction  and  sigma  theta  sensors  are  Met  One 
50. 5H  Sonic  Wind  Sensors,  while  the  temperature  sensors  are  Met  One  Model  060A-2 
thermistors.  Delta-temperature  measurements  are  recorded  by  matched  pairs  of  Met  One 
Model  062MP  instruments.  The  dew  point  measurements  are  made  by  an  Edge  Tech  200M 
Chilled  Mirror  Sensor  at  the  33-ft  level.  The  precipitation  measurements  are  made  at  ground 
level  by  a  Met  One  Model  375  Tipping  Rain/Snow  Gauge  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283).  See 
Table  2-41  for  instrumentation  specifications. 

2. 9. 4. 2  Data  Recording 

Tower  sensors  are  digitally  sampled  once  per  second.  Fifteen  minute  and  hourly  averages  are 
calculated  and  stored  in  separate  15-min  and  hourly  average  files.  Precipitation  is  totaled 
hourly.  The  hourly  data  are  stored  to  be  later  used  in  yJQ  and  dose  assessment  calculations 
(PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

2. 9. 4. 3  Instrument  Maintenance 

Full  system  calibrations  are  done  on  a  3-month  basis.  These  calibrations  include  everything 
from  the  meteorological  sensors  to  the  data  acquisition  system.  Wind  sensors  are  swapped  out 
and  returned  to  Met  One  for  a  wind  tunnel  calibration  on  an  annual  basis  (during  every  fourth 
calibration)  (PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

The  maximum  height  of  influence  of  a  structure  wake  generally  does  not  exceed  2.5  times  the 
structure  height  for  a  squat  building  (width  greater  than  height)  such  as  the  meteorological 
building  at  the  base  of  the  primary  meteorological  tower.  The  meteorological  building  is  12  ft 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Affected  Environment 


high.  Based  on  that  height,  the  upper  limit  of  the  meteorological  building  aerodynamic  wake  will 
not  exceed  a  height  of  30  ft,  which  is  below  the  height  of  the  lowest  33  ft  wind  measurements  on 
the  primary  tower.  Therefore,  the  meteorological  building  aerodynamic  wake  does  not  affect 
meteorological  tower  wind  measurements.  Additionally,  the  10:1  distance/height  ratio  criterion 
does  not  apply  to  the  meteorological  building  because  its  height  (12  ft)  does  not  exceed  one  half 
the  height  of  the  lowest  wind  measurement  (33  ft). 

Overall,  the  topography  (including  raising  the  grade  for  a  portion  of  the  site)  and  existing  and 
new  plant  structures  in  the  vicinity  of  the  onsite  meteorological  towers  are  not  expected  to 
adversely  affect  meteorological  measurements.  Similarly,  vegetation  and  minor  structures  in 
the  vicinity  of  the  meteorological  towers,  such  as  the  meteorological  building,  will  not  adversely 
affect  meteorological  measurements.

2.10  Nonradiological  Health 

This  section  describes  aspects  of  the  environment  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  vicinity  of  the  site 
associated  with  nonradiological  human  health  impacts.  The  section  provides  the  baseline  for 
evaluation  of  impacts  to  human  health  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site.  Building  activities  have  the  potential  to  affect  public  and  occupational  health, 
create  impacts  from  noise,  and  impact  health  of  the  public  and  workers  from  transportation  of 
construction  materials  and  workers  to  the  building  site.  Operation  of  a  new  plant  has  the 
potential  to  impact  the  public  and  workers  at  the  PSEG  Site  from  operation  of  the  cooling 
system;  noise  generated  by  operations;  electromagnetic  fields  (EMF)  generated  by  transmission 
systems;  and  transportation  of  operations  and  outage  workers  to  and  from  the  site.

2.10.1  Public  and  Occupational  Health 

This  section  describes  public  and  occupational  health  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity  associated 
with  air  quality,  occupational  injuries,  and  etiological  agents  (i.e. ,  disease-causing 
microorganisms). 

2. 10. 1. 1  Air  Quality 

Public  and  occupational  health  can  be  impacted  by  changes  in  air  quality  from  activities  that 
contribute  to  fugitive  dust,  vehicle  and  equipment  exhaust  emissions,  and  automobile  exhaust 
from  commuter  traffic  (NRC  1996-TN288).  Air  quality  near  the  PSEG  Site  is  discussed  in 
Section  2.9.2.  As  discussed  in  that  section,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  and  New  Castle 
County,  Delaware,  are  designated  as  attainment  areas  for  all  criteria  pollutants  except  8-hour 
O3.  Recently,  New  Castle  County  was  redesignated  from  nonattainment  area  to  maintenance 
area  for  PM2.5.  Fugitive  dust  and  particulate  matter  from  engine  exhaust  (including  PM10  and 
PM2.5)  can  be  released  into  the  atmosphere  during  any  site  excavations  and  grading.  Most  of 
the  activities  that  generate  fugitive  dust  would  be  short  in  duration,  cover  a  small  area,  and 
controllable  using  watering,  application  of  soil  adhesives,  seeding,  and  other  best  management 
practices  employed  by  PSEG  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Exhaust  emissions  during  normal  plant  operations  associated  with  onsite  vehicles  and 
equipment,  as  well  as  from  commuter  traffic,  can  affect  air  quality.  Nonradiological  supporting 
equipment  (e.g.,  diesel  generators  and/or  gas  turbines,  auxiliary  boilers)  and  other 
nonradiological  emission-generating  sources  (e.g.,  storage  tanks)  or  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site 
are  not  a  significant  source  of  criteria  pollutant  emissions.  Diesel  generators  and/or  gas 
turbines  would  be  in  place  for  emergency  use  only  but  would  be  started  regularly  to  test  that  the 
systems  are  operational.  The  auxiliary  boilers  would  be  used  for  heating  buildings,  primarily 
during  the  winter  months,  and  for  process  steam  during  site  start-ups.  Emissions  from 
nonradiological  air  pollution  sources  are  permitted  by  the  Clean  Air  Act  (42  USC  7401  et  seq.  - 
TN1 141 )  and  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP). 

2.10.1.2  Occupational  Injuries 

In  general,  occupational  health  risks  to  workers  and  onsite  personnel  engaged  in  activities  such 
as  building,  maintenance,  testing,  excavation,  and  modifications  are  expected  to  be  dominated 
by  occupational  injuries  (e.g.,  falls,  electric  shock,  asphyxiation)  or  occupational  illnesses. 
Historically,  actual  injury  and  fatality  rates  at  nuclear  reactor  facilities  have  been  lower  than  the 
average  U.S.  industrial  rates,  with  a  2009  average  incidence  rate  of  0.6  per  100  workers 
(BLS  2010-TN2427).  The  annual  incidence  rates  (the  number  of  injuries  and  illnesses  per 
100  full-time  workers)  for  the  State  of  New  Jersey  and  the  United  States  for  electrical  power 
generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  workers  are  3.9  and  3.6,  respectively  (BLS  2010- 
TN2428;  BLS  2010-TN2731 ).  These  statistics  are  used  to  estimate  the  likely  number  of 
occupational  injuries  and  illnesses  for  operation  of  the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  and  to  predict 
the  likely  number  of  cases  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Occupational  injury  and  fatality  risks  are  reduced  by  strict  adherence  to  the  NRC  and 
Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  (OSHA)  safety  standards,  practices,  and 


NUREG-2168 


2-186

Affected  Environment 


procedures  required  to  minimize  worker  exposures.  Appropriate  state  and  local  statutes  also 
must  be  considered  when  assessing  the  occupational  hazards  and  health  risks  associated  with 
the  PSEG  Site.  Currently,  the  existing  PSEG  Site  has  programs  and  personnel  to  promote  safe 
work  practices  and  respond  to  occupational  injuries  and  illnesses  at  SGS  and  HCGS.  PSEG 
has  implemented  procedures  at  SGS  and  HCGS  providing  personnel  who  work  at  the  existing 
plants  with  an  effective  means  of  preventing  accidents  due  to  unsafe  conditions  and  unsafe 
acts.  They  include  safe  work  practices  to  address  hearing  protection;  personal  protective 
equipment;  electrical  safety;  chemical  handling,  storage,  and  use;  and  other  industrial  hazards. 
In  addition,  personnel  are  provided  with  training  on  safety  procedures  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

2.10.1.3  Etiological  A  gents 

Public  and  occupational  health  can  be  compromised  by  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  that 
encourage  the  growth  of  disease-causing  microorganisms  (etiological  agents).  Thermal 
discharges  from  the  water  circulation  system  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  to  the  Delaware 
River  have  the  potential  to  increase  the  growth  of  thermophilic  microorganisms.  The  types  of 
organisms  of  concern  for  public  and  occupational  health  include  enteric  pathogens  (such  as 
Salmonella  spp.,  Shigella  spp.,  and  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa),  thermophilic  fungi,  bacteria 
(such  as  Legionella  spp.),  and  free-living  amoeba  (such  as  Naegleria  fowlerianb 
Acanthamoeba  spp.).  These  microorganisms  could  give  rise  to  potentially  serious  human 
health  concerns,  particularly  at  high  exposure  levels. 

Available  data  assembled  by  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  for  the 
years  2000  to  2010  (CDC  2002-TN2444;  CDC  2002-TN2438;  CDC  2003-TN2437;  CDC  2004- 
TN2435;  CDC  2004-TN2436;  CDC  2005-TN2442;  CDC  2006-TN2445;  CDC  2006-TN2441; 

CDC  2007-TN2440;  CDC  2008-TN2439;  CDC  2008-TN557;  CDC  2010-TN2447;  CDC  2011- 
TN2446;  CDC  2011-TN2448;  CDC  2011-TN558;  CDC  2012-TN2378;  CDC  2013-TN2377)  were 
reviewed  for  outbreaks  of  Legionellosis,  Salmonellosis,  or  Shigellosis.  Outbreaks  that  occurred 
in  Delaware  or  New  Jersey  from  2000  to  2010  were  within  the  range  of  national  trends  in  terms 
of  cases  per  100,000  population  or  total  cases  per  year,  and  the  outbreaks  were  associated  with 
pools,  spas,  or  lakes.  The  Salem  County  Department  of  Health  and  the  New  Jersey  and 
Delaware  state  health  agencies  have  not  recorded  any  major  waterborne  disease  outbreaks  in 
the  Delaware  River  in  proximity  to  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  The  CDC  Council  of 
State  Territorial  Epidemiologists  Na egleria  Work  Group,  after  reviewing  the  data  from  different 
sources,  identified  123  fatal  cases  of  primary  amebic  meningoencephalitis  (PAM,  caused  by 
Naegleria  fowleri)  in  the  United  States  between  1962  and  2011;  most  cases  occurred  in 
southern  states  during  the  months  of  July  and  September,  and  no  cases  of  PAM  have  been 
associated  with  the  region  encompassing  the  Delaware  River  (CDC  2013-TN2375). 

2.10.2  Noise 

Any  pressure  variation  that  the  human  ear  can  detect  is  considered  as  sound,  and  noise  is 
defined  as  unwanted  sound.  Sound  is  described  in  terms  of  amplitude  (perceived  as  loudness) 
and  frequency  (perceived  as  pitch).  Sound  pressure  levels  are  typically  measured  by  using  the 
logarithmic  decibel  (dB)  scale  A-weighting  (denoted  by  dBA)  (ASA  1983-TN2836;  ASA  1985- 
TN2837).  The  dBA  measure,  which  is  widely  used  to  account  for  human  sensitivity  to 
frequencies  of  sound  (i.e.,  less  sensitive  to  lower  and  higher  frequencies  and  most  sensitive  to

Affected  Environment 


sounds  between  1  and  5  kHz),  correlates  well  with  a  human’s  subjective  reaction  to  sound. 
Several  sound  descriptors  have  been  developed  to  account  for  variations  of  sound  with  time. 

L90  is  the  sound  level  exceeded  90  percent  of  the  time,  called  the  residual  sound  level  (or 
background  level)  or  fairly  steady  lower  sound  level  on  which  discrete  single  sound  events  are 
superimposed.  The  equivalent  continuous  sound  level  (Leq)  is  a  sound  level  that,  if  it  were 
continuous  during  a  specific  time  period,  would  contain  the  same  total  energy  as  a  time-varying 
sound.  (Unless  designated  otherwise,  all  sound  levels  are  instantaneous  or  Leq  values 
measured  over  short  time  periods,  such  as  one  minute.)  In  addition,  human  responses  to  noise 
differ  depending  on  the  time  of  the  day  (e.g.,  higher  sensitivity  to  noise  during  nighttime  hours 
because  of  lower  background  noise  levels).  The  day-night  average  sound  level  (Ldn  or  DNL)  is 
a  single  dBA  value  calculated  from  hourly  Leq  over  a  24-hour  period,  with  the  addition  of 
10  dBA  to  sound  levels  from  10  p.m.  to  7  a.m.  to  account  for  the  greater  sensitivity  of  most 
people  to  nighttime  noise.  Generally,  a  3-dBA  change  over  existing  noise  levels  is  considered 
to  be  a  “just  noticeable”  difference,  while  a  10-dBA  increase  is  subjectively  perceived  as  a 
doubling  in  loudness  and  almost  always  causes  an  adverse  community  response  (ASA  1983- 
TN2836;  ASA  1985-TN2837). 

The  noise  around  the  PSEG  Site  is  typical  of  a  commercial  operation  in  a  mostly  rural  area 
because  there  are  no  schools,  businesses,  or  commercial  buildings  within  5  mi  of  the  site 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  primary  operational  noise  sources  associated  with  SGS  and  HCGS 
and  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  the  switchyard,  transformers,  and  cooling 
towers  (NDCTs,  mechanical  draft  cooling  towers  [MDCTs],  and  fan-assisted  NDCTs). 
Fan-assisted  NDCTs  are  continuous  noise  sources  during  plant  operation,  with  an  estimated 
noise  emission  of  60  dBA  at  1 ,000  ft.  The  estimated  noise  emissions  for  the  MDCTs  and 
NDCTs  are  58  and  50  dBA  at  1 ,000  ft,  respectively  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283).  These  operational 
noises  mix  with  those  from  traffic,  residential  activities,  and  natural  sources.  While  noise  is 
diminished  by  distance,  foliage,  and  geographic  features,  it  will  be  attenuated  much  less  over 
water. 

In  2009,  PSEG  conducted  a  baseline  noise  survey  and  concluded  that  the  noise  from  sources  at 
SGS  and  HCGS  met  the  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  industrial  standards  of  65  dBA  for  daytime 
at  the  PSEG  Site  property  boundary  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Based  on  natural  attenuation  of 
noise  over  distance,  noise  levels  estimated  for  the  onsite  cooling  towers  at  a  new  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  would  not  exceed  the  Delaware  and  New  Jersey  nighttime  noise  standards  of 
55  and  50  dBA,  respectively,  at  the  property  boundary  of  the  nearest  residence.  The  estimated 
fan-assisted  NDCT  noise  level  at  10,000  ft  is  41  dBA,  with  the  nearest  residences  located 
14,700  ft  to  the  west  and  15,900  ft  to  the  east  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

2.10.3  Transportation 

The  transportation  network  surrounding  the  PSEG  Site  consists  of  access  roads  for  SGS  and 
HCGS,  New  Jersey  state  and  county  highways,  and  a  railway.  Most  traffic  is  personal  vehicle 
and  over-the-road  tractor/trailer  transport.  Plant  workers  from  the  surrounding  areas  primarily 
travel  toward  SGS  and  HCGS  on  a  variety  of  interstate,  state,  and  secondary  roads  where  they 
converge  on  the  existing  access  road,  which  is  the  only  land  access  to  the  existing  PSEG 
property  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  A  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  an  additional  4.8-mi 
causeway  to  the  north-northeast  that  would  connect  with  CR  672  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283).  The 


NUREG-2168 


2-188

Affected  Environment 


construction  and  operations  workforces  for  a  new  plant  would  be  expected  to  use  this  causeway 
instead  of  the  existing  PSEG  property  access  road.  A  new  plant  would  also  have  direct  access 
to  the  Delaware  River  via  a  barge  unloading  facility. 

Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
could  have  impacts  to  traffic  patterns  along  roadways  and  intersections  in  the  Salem  County 
area.  In  2009,  PSEG  conducted  a  traffic  impact  analysis  to  determine  improvements  to  mitigate 
traffic  problems  (including  potential  traffic  accidents)  associated  with  increased  traffic  volume 
during  development  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  as  the  traffic  volume  is  projected  to  increase 
to  approximately  2,200  cars  during  building  and  to  1,200  cars  during  operation  and  refueling 
outages  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  It  is  anticipated  that  installation  of  traffic  controls  and  additional 
turn  lanes  as  part  of  the  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  would  improve  the  overall 
traffic  patterns  during  building  of  a  new  plant  as  well  as  afterwards  when  traffic  volume  supports 
operations  and  refueling  activities  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

2.10.4  Electromagnetic  Fields 

Transmission  lines  generate  both  electric  and  magnetic  fields,  referred  to  collectively  as  EMFs. 
Public  and  worker  health  can  be  compromised  by  acute  exposure  to  electrical  sources 
associated  with  power  transmission  systems,  including  switching  stations  (or  substations)  on  the 
site  and  transmission  lines  connecting  the  plant  to  the  regional  electrical  distribution  grid. 
Transmission  lines  operate  at  a  frequency  of  60  Hz  (60  cycles  per  second),  which  is  considered 
to  be  extremely  low  frequency  (ELF).  In  comparison,  television  transmitters  have  frequencies  of 
55  to  890  MHz,  and  microwaves  have  frequencies  of  1,000  MHz  and  greater  (NRC  1996- 
TN288).  The  existing  transmission  corridors  from  the  PSEG  property  are  described  in  Section 
3. 2. 2. 2.  HCGS  and  SGS  are  interconnected  with  the  regional  power  grid  via  four  transmission 
lines  extending  to  the  Red  Lion  substation  in  Delaware  and  the  New  Freedom  substation  in  New 
Jersey  as  part  of  the  PJM  Interconnection,  LLC  (PJM)  power  grid.  PSEG  has  evaluated 
transmission  requirements,  and  a  new  offsite  transmission  line  may  be  needed,  dependent  upon 
the  specific  reactor  technology  selected  and  other  transmission  projects  planned  within  the  PJM 
regional  transmission  system. 

Electric  shock  resulting  from  direct  access  to  energized  conductors  or  from  induced  charges  in 
metallic  structures  is  an  example  of  an  acute  effect  from  EMF  associated  with  transmission  lines 
(NRC  1996-TN288).  Objects  near  transmission  lines  can  become  electrically  charged  by  close 
proximity  to  the  electric  field  of  the  line.  An  induced  current  can  be  generated  in  such  cases, 
where  the  current  can  flow  from  the  line  through  the  object  into  the  ground.  Capacitive  charges 
can  occur  in  objects  that  are  in  the  electric  field  of  a  line,  storing  the  electric  charge,  but 
insulated  from  the  ground.  A  person  standing  on  the  ground  can  receive  an  electric  shock  from 
coming  into  contact  with  such  an  object  because  of  the  sudden  discharge  of  the  electrical 
charge  through  the  person’s  body  to  the  ground.  Such  acute  effects  are  controlled  and 
minimized  by  conformance  with  the  National  Electrical  Safety  Code  (NESC)  of  the  Organization 
of  PJM  States,  Inc.  (OPSI),  which  organizes  the  statutory  regulatory  agencies  in  the  13  states 
and  the  District  of  Columbia  where  PJM  operates  transmission  systems. 

Long-term  or  chronic  exposure  to  power  transmission  lines  have  been  studied  for  a  number  of 
years.  These  health  effects  were  evaluated  in  NUREG-1437,  which  concluded 


November  2015 


2-189 


NUREG-2168 


Affected  Environment 


“The  chronic  effects  of  electromagnetic  fields  (EMFs)  associated  with  nuclear 
plants  and  associated  transmission  lines  are  uncertain.  Studies  of  60-Hz  EMFs 
have  not  uncovered  consistent  evidence  linking  harmful  effects  with  field 
exposures.  EMFs  are  unlike  other  agents  that  have  a  toxic  effect  (e.g.,  toxic 
chemicals  and  ionizing  radiation)  in  that  dramatic  acute  effects  cannot  be  forced 
and  longer-term  effects,  if  real,  are  subtle.  Because  the  state  of  the  science  is 
currently  inadequate,  no  generic  conclusion  on  human  health  impacts  is 
possible”  (NRC  1996-TN288). 

2.11  Radiological  Environment 

A  radiological  environmental  monitoring  program  (REMP)  has  been  conducted  around  HCGS 
and  SGS  since  operations  began  in  1977  (SGS  Unit  1),  1981  (SGS  Unit  2),  and  1986  (HCGS). 
This  program  measures  radiation  and  radioactive  materials  from  all  sources,  including  the  SGS 
Unit  1  and  SGS  Unit  2  PWRs  and  the  HCGS  Unit  1  BWR.  The  REMP  includes  the  following 
exposure  pathways:  direct  (dosimeters),  airborne  (iodine  and  particulates),  waterborne  (surface 
water  and  groundwater,  drinking  water,  and  sediment),  and  ingestion  (milk,  vegetation,  fish,  and 
invertebrates).  A  pre-operational  environmental  monitoring  program  was  conducted  from  1973 
to  1976  to  establish  a  baseline  to  observe  fluctuations  of  radioactivity  in  the  environment  after 
operations  began  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  After  routine  operation  of  SGS  Unit  1  started  in  1977, 
SGS  Unit  2  started  in  1981,  and  HCGS  started  in  1986,  the  monitoring  program  continued  to 
assess  the  radiological  impacts  to  workers,  the  public,  and  the  environment.  The  results  of  this 
monitoring  are  documented  in  the  annual  environmental  operating  report  for  HCGS  and  SGS 
titled  201 1  Annual  Radioactive  Effluent  Release  Report  for  the  Salem  and  Hope  Creek 
Generating  Stations  (PSEG  2012-TN2724).  Administrative  controls  and  physical  barriers  are  in 
place  to  monitor  and  minimize  dose  from  the  operational  independent  spent  fuel  storage 
installation  (ISFSI). 

During  an  8-year  period  from  2004  to  2012,  PSEG  reported  the  annual  direct  radiation  exposure 
(annual  thermoluminescent  dosimeter  [TLD]  readings)  at  the  three  conservative  locations  close 
to  unrestricted  areas  ranged  from  41.2  to  63.0  mrem  for  the  existing  PSEG  Site 
(PSEG  2005-TN2725;  PSEG  2006-TN2726;  PSEG  2007-TN2728;  PSEG  2008-TN2747; 

PSEG  2009-TN2730;  PSEG  2010-TN2737;  PSEG  2011-TN2738;  PSEG  2012-TN2724). 
Trending  graphs  in  the  2012  Annual  Radioactive  Effluent  Release  Report  show  the  annual  total 
body  doses  due  to  liquid  and  gaseous  effluents  from  SGS  and  HCGS  released  in  the  years 
2007  to  2012  were  equal  to  or  less  than  approximately  0.16  mrem  (liquid)  and  equal  to  or  less 
than  0.011  mrem  (gaseous)  (PSEG  2012-TN2724). 

As  part  of  the  REMP,  PSEG  evaluated  the  maximum  dose  to  a  member  of  the  public  each  year 
using  effluent  concentration  and  historical  meteorological  data  for  the  existing  PSEG  Site.  For 
the  8  years  reviewed,  the  maximum  annual  total  body  doses  to  a  member  of  the  public  from 
operation  of  SGS  Units  1  and  2  and  HCGS  Unit  1  were  approximately  1.13  mrem/yr  inside  the 
site  boundary  (2006)  and  0.99  mrem/yr  outside  the  site  boundary  (2005)  (PSEG  2006-TN2726; 
PSEG  2007-TN2728).  These  data  show  that  doses  to  the  maximally  exposed  individuals 
around  the  existing  PSEG  Site  were  a  small  fraction  of  the  limits  specified  in  Federal 
environmental  radiation  standards  (10  CFR  Part  20-TN283;  10  CFR  Part  50-TN249;  Appendix  I; 
and  40  CFR  Part  190-TN739).

In  September  2002,  SGS  personnel  found  evidence  of  contaminated  water  leakage  through  a 
wall  into  the  Unit  1  Auxiliary  Building  Mechanical  Penetration  Room  (NRC  2006-TN1000).  Upon 
further  investigation,  it  was  determined  that  the  contamination  was  due  to  SGS  Unit  1  Spent 
Fuel  Pool  water  that  had  leaked  into  a  narrow  seismic  gap  between  SGS  Unit  1  Auxiliary 
Building  and  SGS  Unit  1  Fuel  Handling  Building  and  then  had  entered  the  Mechanical 
Penetration  Room.  The  root  cause  for  the  leakage  was  determined  to  be  the  drain  system  for 
the  SGS  Unit  1  spent  fuel  pool:  the  drain  system  had  become  obstructed,  resulting  in  a  buildup 
of  contaminated  water  between  the  spent  fuel  pool  liner  and  the  concrete  structure.  This  water 
then  migrated  through  a  wall  and  penetrations. 

As  discussed  in  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission's  Lessons  Learned  Task  Force 
Report{ NRC  2006-TN1000)  and  PSEG’s  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280),  the  SGS  Unit  1  licensee 
(PSEG)  initiated  several  actions  to  remediate  and  monitor  the  migration  of  spent  fuel  pool  water 
to  the  groundwater,  such  as 

•  initiated  drilling  wells; 

•  identified  tritium  contamination  in  nonpotable  groundwater  near  the  SGS  Unit  1  fuel  handling 
building  in  February  2003; 

•  initiated  an  extensive  groundwater  sampling  program  to  fully  characterize  the  contamination 
(maximum  tritium  levels  of  1 5,000,000  pCi/L  were  identified  in  the  groundwater  near  the 
seismic  gap); 

•  established  in  2004,  in  conjunction  with  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  the  Remedial  Investigation 
Work  Plan,  an  extensive  groundwater  remediation  program  that  includes  ongoing 
remediation  of  the  seismic  gap  (PSEG  2015-TN4280);  and 

•  by  December  2005,  extracted  about  1 .6  Ci  of  tritium  with  approximately  2  to  4  Ci  remaining 
to  be  extracted. 

PSEG’s  evaluations  did  not  identify  any  immediate  health  and  safety  consequences  to  onsite 
workers  or  members  of  the  public  (NRC  2006-TN1000).  No  contamination  is  believed  to  have 
migrated  to  any  populated  unrestricted  areas.  PSEG  assumed  that  the  tritium  has  reached  the 
Delaware  River,  calculated  the  resultant  exposure,  and  included  the  results  in  the  liquid  effluent 
data  of  the  2013  annual  effluent  release  report  (PSEG  2014-TN4219).  The  resulting  annual 
quantity  of  tritium  estimated  to  have  reached  the  Delaware  River  from  this  tritium  plume  of 
approximately  0.08  Ci  is  a  small  fraction  of  the  annual  radioactive  liquid  effluent  release  of 
tritium  of  approximately  700  Ci  from  SGS  Unit  1  and  2  and  HCGS  for  2013  (PSEG  2014- 
TN4219;  PSEG  2014-TN4220).  The  remediation  efforts  have  created  an  in-gradient  of  water, 
causing  the  shallow  groundwater  to  flow  toward  the  plant  instead  of  offsite.  No  other  plant- 
related  radionuclides  have  been  identified  in  the  groundwater. 

The  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission's  Lessons  Learned  Task  Force  Report  (NRC  2006) 
made  recommendations  regarding  potential  unmonitored  groundwater  contamination  at  U.S. 
nuclear  plants.  In  response  to  that  report,  the  Nuclear  Energy  Institute  (NEI)  developed  the 
Ground  Water  Protection  Initiative  (NEI  2007-TN1913).  Based  on  the  NEI  guidance,  PSEG 
initiated  the  RGPP  in  2006  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  status  of  the  RGPP  was  reported  in 
PSEG’s  annual  Radiological  Environmental  Operating  Reports  through  201 1  and  is  now

included  as  Appendix  C  of  PSEG’s  Annual  Radiological  Effluent  Release  Reports  to  fully  comply 
with  the  NEI  guidance  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  While  approximately  15  RGPP  wells  had 
occasional  tritium  levels  above  the  lower  limit  of  detection  of  approximately  300  pCi/L  (PSEG 
2015-TN4280),  the  detected  tritium  concentrations  were  far  below  the  EPA  DWS  of  20,000 
pCi/L  (41  FR  28402-TN2746). 

2.12  Related  Federal  Projects  and  Consultation 

This  section  describes  Federal  activities  within  the  50-mi  region  that  could  warrant  consideration 
along  with  the  building  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  as  part  of  a 
cumulative  impacts  analysis  in  accordance  with  40  CFR  1508.25  (TN428).  This  section  does 
not  include  a  description  of  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS,  as  the  environmental  effects  of  these 
facilities  and  their  ongoing  operations  are  included  as  part  of  the  baseline  conditions 
characterized  earlier  in  this  chapter.  Relevant  information  regarding  the  operations  of  the 
existing  HCGS  and  SGS  plants  is  discussed  further  in  the  cumulative  impact  analysis  in  Chapter 
7  of  this  EIS.  The  NRC  is  required  under  NEPA  Section  1 02(2)(c)  to  consult  with  and  obtain 
comments  of  any  Federal  agency  that  has  jurisdiction  by  law  or  special  expertise  with  respect  to 
any  environmental  impact  involved  in  the  subject  matter  of  this  EIS.  The  NRC  is  consulting  with 
the  NMFS,  FWS,  and  ACHP.  Consultation  correspondence  is  listed  in  Appendix  F.  In  addition, 
the  NRC  is  cooperating  with  the  USACE  in  the  preparation  of  the  EIS. 

According  to  the  guidance  in  NUREG-1555  (NRC  2000-TN614),  Federal  project  activities 
meeting  the  following  criteria  should  be  identified  and  described: 

•  project  activities  related  to  the  acquisition  and/or  use  of  the  site  and  transmission  corridors 
or  of  any  other  offsite  property  needed  for  the  proposed  project, 

•  project  activities  required  either  to  provide  an  adequate  source  of  plant  cooling  water  or  to 
ensure  an  adequate  supply  of  cooling  water  over  the  operating  lifetime  of  the  plant, 

•  project  activities  completed  as  a  condition  of  plant  construction  or  operation, 

•  project  activities  that  result  in  significant  new  power  purchases  within  the  applicant’s  service 
area  that  have  been  used  to  justify  the  need  for  power,  and 

•  planned  Federal  projects  that  are  contingent  on  the  new  plant  construction  and  operation. 

There  are  two  Federal  project  activities  identified  within  the  region: 

•  the  USACE  Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  and 

•  the  proposed  land  exchange  between  the  USACE  and  PSEG  involving  a  portion  of  the 
USACE  Artificial  Island  CDF  that  abuts  the  northern  boundary  of  the  existing  PSEG

The  USACE  actively  maintains  the  Federal  shipping/navigation  channel  in  the  Delaware  River 
and  Bay  to  a  depth  of  approximately  40  ft,  specific  to  the  various  reaches  of  the  channel.  In 
1992,  the  USACE  completed  a  feasibility  study  for  deepening  the  Delaware  Bay  and  River  main 
channel  from  40  to  45  ft.  This  feasibility  study  found  that  the  proposed  deepening  project  was

Affected  Environment 


environmentally  sound,  economically  justified,  and  technically  feasible.  As  a  result  of  the 
feasibility  study  findings,  Congress  authorized  the  proposed  channel  deepening  project.  Since 
1992,  there  have  been  additional  authorized  modifications  to  the  project.  The  USACE  issued  an 
additional  supplemental  EIS  in  1997  (USACE  1997-TN2281 )  and  EAs  in  2009  and  2011 
(USACE  2009-TN2663;  USACE  201 1-TN2262).  A  Project  Partnership  Agreement  was  signed 
by  the  USACE  and  the  Philadelphia  Regional  Port  Authority  in  2008. 

The  deepening  project  would  affect  a  stretch  of  the  Delaware  Bay  and  Delaware  River 
extending  from  the  Philadelphia  Harbor  (including  Camden,  New  Jersey)  to  the  mouth  of  the 
Delaware  Bay.  The  deepening  project  follows  the  existing  40-ft-deep  Federal  main  shipping 
channel  alignment.  No  change  is  proposed  to  the  existing  authorized  widths  in  the  straight 
portions  of  the  channel,  including  the  400-ft-wide  channel  in  Philadelphia  Harbor,  the 
800-ft-wide  channel  from  the  Philadelphia  Navy  Yard  to  Bombay  Hook,  and  the  1 ,000-ft-wide 
channel  from  Bombay  Hook  to  the  mouth  of  the  Delaware  Bay.  However,  1 1  of  the  16  existing 
bends  in  the  channel  will  be  widened  for  safer  navigation.  In  addition,  the  Marcus  Hook 
Anchorage  will  be  deepened  to  45  ft  (USACE  1997-TN2281;  USACE  2009-TN2663; 

USACE  201 1-TN2262). 

The  USACE  estimates  that  1 6  million  yd3  of  material  may  be  dredged  as  part  of  this  project. 

The  dredged  material  from  the  river  portion  will  be  placed  within  existing  Federal  upland  CDFs 
in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  (USACE  201 1-TN2262). 

Project  activities  in  the  vicinity  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  include  deepening 
the  main  channel  and  widening  two  bends  on  the  Delaware  side  of  the  river.  Following  the 
completion  of  the  deepening  project,  normal  channel  maintenance  dredging  operations  will  help 
ensure  the  new  channel  configuration.  The  discharge  and  intake  structures  for  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  be  located  in  areas  that  will  be  dredged  by  the  USACE 
as  part  of  its  deepening  project  and/or  impact  the  Federal  shipping/navigation  channel. 

The  environmental  impacts  of  the  deepening  project  and  associated  follow  up  maintenance 
dredging  are  discussed  as  part  of  cumulative  impacts  in  Chapter  7  of  this  EIS. 

Proposed  Land  Exchange  Between  the  USACE  and  PSEG 

The  USACE  owns  approximately  305  ac  of  land  north  of  the  existing  PSEG  property  that  are 
used  as  a  CDF  for  dredge  material  from  Delaware  River  channel  maintenance  operations.  This 
CDF,  known  as  the  Artificial  Island  CDF,  is  composed  of  three  cells,  and  the  southernmost  cell 
abuts  the  northern  boundary  of  the  existing  PSEG  property.  This  cell  is  used  intermittently  and 
currently  consists  of  fill  material  that  is  overgrown  by  common  exotic,  invasive  reed  ( Phragmites 
australis )  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

PSEG  has  developed  a  plant  layout  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  that  would  use  this  previously 
disturbed  CDF  and  limited  adjoining  marsh  areas  as  part  of  its  plant  facility  and  construction 
area.  PSEG  has  developed  an  agreement  in  principle  with  the  USACE  to  acquire  an  additional 
85  ac  immediately  north  of  HCGS  (see  Section  2.2  and  Figure  2-2).  Therefore,  with  the  land 
acquisition,  the  entire  PSEG  Site  would  be  819  ac.  Subsequent  to  the  agreement  in  principle 
with  the  USACE,  PSEG  would  develop  a  lease  agreement  for  an  additional  45  ac  of  USACE

CDF  land  north  of  the  PSEG  Site  for  the  concrete  batch  plant  and  temporary  construction/ 
laydown  use.  At  the  completion  of  construction,  the  45  ac  of  leased  land  would  be  returned 
to  the  USACE,  subject  to  any  required  long-term  EAB  control  conditions  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  The  environmental  impacts  of  the  PSEG  land  acquisition  and  lease  from  the 
USACE  are  assessed  as  part  of  cumulative  impacts  in  Chapter  7  of  this  EIS.

3.0  SITE  LAYOUT  AND  PLANT  PARAMETER  ENVELOPE 


The  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG)  Site  for  which  an  early  site  permit 
(ESP)  application  has  been  submitted  is  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek 
Generating  Station  (HCGS)  and  Salem  Generating  Station  (SGS)  Units  1  and  2,  in  Lower 
Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The  PSEG  Site  is  located  on  the 
southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  on  the  east  bank  of  the  Delaware  River,  about  15  mi  south  of 
the  Delaware  Memorial  Bridge;  18  mi  south  of  Wilmington,  Delaware;  30  mi  southwest  of 
Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania;  and  7.5  mi  southwest  of  Salem,  New  Jersey. 

Of  the  81 9-ac  PSEG  Site,  PSEG  owns  734  ac  as  part  of  the  existing  HCGS/SGS  site.  PSEG 
has  developed  an  agreement  in  principle  with  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  to 
acquire  through  a  land  exchange  an  additional  85  ac  of  the  USACE  Artificial  Island  Confined 
Disposal  Facility  (CDF)  land  immediately  north  of  HCGS.  Therefore,  with  the  land  acquisition, 
the  PSEG  Site  would  total  819  ac.  Also,  during  plant  construction  PSEG  would  temporarily 
lease  from  the  USACE  45  ac  of  the  CDF  land  north  of  the  proposed  site  as  the  location  of  the 
concrete  batch  plant  and  a  construction/laydown  area. 

This  chapter  describes  the  approach  PSEG  used  to  identify  the  key  plant  parameters  and  site 
characteristics  needed  to  assess  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  action 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  external  appearance  and  plant  layout  are  discussed  in  Section  3.1; 
plant  parameters  and  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  are  discussed  in  Sections  3.2 
and  3.3,  respectively;  and  operational  activities  are  discussed  in  Section  3.4. 

3.1  External  Appearance  and  Site  Layout 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS,  Units  1  and  2  (Figures  2-2 
and  Figure  3-1).  The  site  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  on  the  east  bank  of 
the  Delaware  River  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  Artificial 
Island  was  created,  beginning  early  in  the  20th  century,  when  the  USACE  began  disposing  of 
hydraulic  dredge  spoils  within  a  progressively  enlarged  diked  area  established  around  a  natural 
bar  that  projected  into  the  river.  The  existing  HCGS/SGS  site  is  generally  developed,  and 
surrounding  habitats  are  best  characterized  as  tidal  marsh  and  grassland.  Figure  3-1  provides 
an  aerial  photograph  of  the  existing  PSEG  property,  and  the  PSEG  Site  is  located  in  the 
undeveloped  area  to  the  left  of  the  HCGS  unit  and  cooling  tower  in  the  figure. 

SGS  consists  of  two  pressurized  water  reactors  (PWRs),  each  with  a  rated  power  level  of 
3,459  MW(t)  generating  capacity.  Unit  1  began  producing  electricity  in  1976,  and  Unit  2  began 
producing  electricity  in  1980.  HCGS  is  located  just  north  of  SGS  and  has  a  single  3,840  MW(t) 
boiling  water  reactor  (BWR)  nuclear  plant.  HCGS  was  originally  designed  as  a  two-unit  plant, 
but  during  the  construction  phase  the  project  was  scaled  back  to  one  unit.  HCGS  began 
operation  in  1986.

Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


The  existing  PSEG  property  totals  734  ac,  of  which  373  ac  are  used  for  HCGS  (153  ac)  and 
SGS  (220  ac).  The  minimum  distance  from  the  SGS  reactor  containment  buildings  to  the 
nearest  exclusion  area  boundary  (EAB)  formed  by  land  is  1,270  m  (4,166  ft).  The  minimum 
distance  from  the  HCGS  accident  release  point  to  the  nearest  EAB  formed  by  land  is  900  m 
(2,953  ft). 

Both  SGS  units  have  steel-lined  concrete  containment  vessels  consisting  of  a  reinforced 
concrete  cylindrical  wall,  a  hemispherical  dome,  and  a  reinforced  concrete  base.  Supporting 
structures  include  a  common  auxiliary  building,  service  building,  turbine  generator  building, 
administration  building,  circulating  and  service  water  intake  structures,  station  switchyard,  and 
separate  fuel  handling  buildings  for  each  unit. 

The  HCGS  primary  containment  is  a  steel  shell  enclosed  in  reinforced  concrete  interconnected 
to  a  torus  type  steel  suppression  chamber.  Supporting  structures  for  HCGS  include  an  auxiliary 
building,  turbine  building,  administration  building  and  warehouse,  service  water  intake  structure, 
switchyard,  and  natural  draft  cooling  tower  (NDCT). 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  adjacent  to  HCGS  and  SGS.  A  new  nuclear  power  plant  would 
require  about  225  ac  as  delineated  in  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan,  included  in  this 
environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  as  Figure  2-2.  As  discussed  in  Section  3.0,  PSEG  has 
developed  an  agreement  with  the  USACE  to  acquire  an  additional  85  ac  directly  north  of  the 
current  PSEG  property  line.  Therefore,  with  the  existing  734  ac  and  the  85-ac  land  acquisition, 
the  PSEG  Site  would  total  819  ac. 

For  purposes  of  the  ESP  application,  a  specific  plant  design  has  not  been  selected;  instead, 
a  set  of  plant  parameter  values  was  chosen  for  the  staff  evaluation  of  the  development  of  the 
PSEG  Site.  This  plant  parameter  envelope  (PPE)  is  based  on  the  addition  of  one  or  two  new 
power  generating  units.  Table  1-2  in  Appendix  I  of  this  EIS  lists  the  PPE  values  used  by  the 
staff.  PSEG  states  that  the  reactor  types  considered  in  developing  the  PPE  are  the  Advanced 
Boiling  Water  Reactor  (ABWR),  Advanced  Passive  1000  (API 000),  U.S.  Evolutionary  Power 
Reactor  (U.S.  EPR),  and  U.S.  Advanced  Pressurized  Water  Reactor  (US-APWR)  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

This  EIS  analyzes  the  environmental  impacts  at  the  PSEG  Site  of  building  and  operating  a 
surrogate  reactor  derived  from  the  parameters  of  four  reactor  technologies:  U.S.  EPR,  ABWR, 
US-APWR,  or  API 000.  Because  a  specific  reactor  technology  has  not  been  selected,  the 
environmental  impact  analyses  in  this  EIS  are  based  on  reactor  bounding  conditions  derived 
from  detailed  reactor  information  supplied  by  the  vendors  to  PSEG  and  not  on  any  specific 
reactor  design.  For  this  EIS,  the  total  bounding  PPE  value  for  the  new  plant  is 
6,830  gross  MW(t)  (dual  unit)  and  2,200  MW(e)  (dual  unit). 

The  proposed  plant  location  and  layout  on  the  PSEG  Site  are  shown  in  the  PSEG  Site 
Utilization  Plan  (Figure  2-2).  The  EAB  minimum  distance  of  600  m  (1 ,970  ft)  is  measured  from 
the  perimeter  of  the  power  block  envelope.  The  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  was  prepared  by 
first  establishing  site  layouts  for  each  of  the  four  reactor  technology  configurations  considered 
for  the  site.  The  primary  power  generation  areas  (e.g.,  power  block  area,  switchyard,  and 
cooling  tower  area)  would  be  located  in  the  same  general  area  on  the  site  for  each  layout

Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


considered.  Once  the  layouts  were  established,  the  bounding  footprint  for  each  specific  area 
(e.g.,  power  block  area)  was  developed  by  determining  the  maximum  east/west  and  north/south 
dimensions.  For  example,  to  define  the  power  block  area,  the  east/west  dimension  of  the  U.S. 
EPR  and  north/south  dimension  of  the  dual  unit  API  000  were  used  to  establish  the  power  block 
rectangle  area.  This  approach  provides  a  bounding  estimate  of  overall  land  use  on  the  PSEG 
Site. 

Permanent  land  impact  is  indicated  on  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  in  Figure  2-2  as  a 
crosshatched  area.  The  land  that  would  be  used  during  construction  is  indicated  by  diagonal 
hatching.  The  specific  areas  used  for  permanent  and  construction  support  features  would  not 
be  defined  until  after  a  reactor  technology  is  selected  but  would  be  within  the  overall  established 
PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  boundary. 

The  new  plant  power  block  structure  height  would  vary  depending  upon  the  reactor  design 
chosen.  The  bounding  structure  height  (excluding  any  cooling  towers)  from  finished  grade  to 
the  top  of  the  tallest  power  block  structure  would  be  234  ft. 

The  new  plant  circulating  water  system  (CWS)  would  include  one  or  two  natural  draft, 
mechanical  draft,  or  fan-assisted  natural  draft  wet  cooling  towers.  The  new  plant  would  also 
include  smaller  mechanical  draft  cooling  towers  for  service  water  system  (SWS)  cooling.  Water 
from  the  Delaware  River  would  be  used  for  makeup  water  for  the  cooling  water  systems.  The 
new  river  intake  and  discharge  structures  are  described  in  Section  3.2.2. 1. 

Existing  infrastructure  would  be  modified  to  integrate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  with  the 
existing  HCGS/SGS  units;  however,  none  of  the  existing  unit  structures  or  facilities  that  directly 
support  power  generation  would  be  shared  or  modified.  As  described  in  Section  3. 2. 2. 3, 
depending  on  the  reactor  technology  selected,  up  to  two  new  switchyards  would  be  required  for 
a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  and  the  existing  onsite  transmission  lines  would  be  modified  as 
required  to  incorporate  the  new  generation  capacity  into  the  electric  grid.  One  new  offsite 
transmission  line  may  be  required  depending  on  future  studies  by  the  regional  transmission 
organization,  PJM  Interconnection,  LLC  (PJM).  The  existing  security  perimeter  would  be 
expanded  to  include  a  new  plant.  The  existing  sewage  treatment  facility,  training  and 
administrative  buildings,  warehouses,  and  other  support  facilities  would  be  used,  expanded,  or 
replaced  to  support  a  new  plant  based  on  economic  and  operational  considerations. 

During  construction,  the  laydown  area  and  temporary  construction  support  facilities  would 
require  205  ac.  After  new  plant  construction  is  complete,  areas  used  for  construction  support 
would  be  restored  where  appropriate  to  match  the  overall  site  appearance  or  used  for  other 
necessary  site  or  industrial  support  purposes.  These  areas  include  equipment  laydown  and 
module  fabrication  areas,  batch  plant  area,  areas  around  completed  structures,  and 
construction  parking. 

3.2  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 

An  applicant  for  an  ESP  need  not  provide  a  detailed  design  of  a  reactor  or  reactors  and  the 
associated  facilities  but  should  provide  sufficient  values  for  parameters  for  the  reactor  or 
reactors  and  the  associated  facilities  so  that  an  assessment  of  site  suitability  can  be  made. 


NUREG-2168

Consequently,  the  ESP  application  may  refer  to  a  PPE  as  a  surrogate  for  a  nuclear  power  plant 
and  its  associated  facilities. 

A  PPE  is  a  set  of  values  for  plant  design  parameters  that  an  ESP  applicant  expects  would 
bound  the  design  characteristics  of  the  reactor  or  reactors  that  might  be  constructed  at  a  given 
site.  The  PPE  values  are  surrogates  for  actual  reactor  design  information.  The  analysis  is 
based  on  the  values  in  the  PPE  and  not  on  any  specific  reactor  design.  Analysis  of 
environmental  impacts  based  on  a  PPE  approach  permits  an  ESP  applicant  to  defer  the 
selection  of  a  reactor  design  until  the  construction  permit  (CP)  or  combined  construction  permit 
and  operating  license  (combined  license  or  COL)  stage.  The  PPE  reflects  the  value  of  each 
parameter  that  it  encompasses  rather  than  the  characteristics  of  any  specific  reactor  design. 

For  purposes  of  the  ESP  application,  PSEG  is  using  a  PPE  approach  that  includes  plant  design 
parameters  derived  from  four  different  reactor  technologies  (i.e. ,  API  000,  U.S.  EPR,  ABWR, 
and  US-APWR). 

This  EIS  analyzes  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  PPE  surrogate  derived  from  the  four  reactor 
technologies  using  either  one  unit  (U.S.  EPR,  ABWR,  or  US-APWR)  or  two  units  (API  000)  at 
the  PSEG  Site.  PSEG  would  not  be  required  to  use  any  of  these  designs  if  it  elected  to  proceed 
with  a  CP  or  COL  application.  For  example,  PSEG  could  reference  one  of  the  large  light  water 
reactors  listed  above  or  a  small  modular  reactor  (SMR)  such  as  the  Holtec  SMR-160(1)  or  any 
other  reactor  design.  However,  a  CP  or  COL  applicant  referencing  an  ESP  would  have  to 
address  whether  the  characteristics  of  the  reactor  ultimately  selected  fell  within  the  values  of  the 
design  parameters  specified  in  the  ESP. 

Review  Approach 

NUREG-1555,  Standard  Review  Plans  for  Environmental  Reviews  for  Nuclear  Power  Plants: 
Environmental  Standard  Review  Plan  (ESRP)  (NRC  2000-TN614),  and  review  standard 
RS-002.  Processing  Applications  for  Early  Site  Permits  (NRC  2004-TN2219),  provide  guidance 
to  the  staff  of  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  to  help  ensure  a  thorough, 
consistent,  and  disciplined  review  of  any  ESP  application.  The  staffs  June  23,  2003,  response 
to  comments  received  on  draft  RS-002  (NRC  2003-TN2064)  provides  additional  insights  into  the 
staffs  approach  to  the  review  of  an  application  using  the  PPE  approach. 

Because  PPE  values  were  used  as  a  surrogate  for  design-specific  values,  the  staff  expected 
PSEG  to  provide  information  sufficient  for  the  staff  to  develop  a  reasonable  independent 
assessment  of  potential  impacts  to  specific  environmental  resources.  In  some  cases,  the 
design-specific  information  called  for  in  the  ESRP  (NRC  2000-TN614)  was  not  provided  in  the 
PSEG  ESP  application  because  it  did  not  exist  or  was  not  available.  Therefore,  the  NRC  staff 
could  not  apply  the  ESRP  guidance  in  those  review  areas.  In  such  cases,  the  NRC  staff  used 
its  experience  and  judgment  to  adapt  the  review  guidance  in  the  ESRP  and  to  develop 
assumptions  necessary  to  evaluate  impacts  to  certain  environmental  resources  to  account  for 


(1)  The  review  team  is  aware  that  PSEG  is  providing  technical  support  to  Holtec  International 

(Holtec  International  2013-TN2807).  However,  this  information  is  not  material  to  the  review  of  the 
ESP  application  because  the  review  is  based  on  PPE  values  rather  than  a  specific  reactor  design.

this  missing  information.  These  assumptions  are  discussed  in  the  appropriate  sections  of  this 
EIS  and  are  summarized  in  Appendix  J  of  this  EIS. 

Because  the  PSEG  PPE  values  do  not  reflect  a  specific  design,  they  were  reviewed  for 
reasonableness.  The  NRC  staff  made  a  determination  that  the  application  was  sufficient  to 
enable  the  staff  to  conduct  its  required  environmental  review  and  that  the  PPE  values  are  not 
unreasonable  for  consideration  by  the  staff  when  making  its  finding  on  the  application  in 
accordance  with  Title  10  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  52.18  (TN251 ).  During 
its  environmental  review,  the  staff  used  its  judgment  to  determine  whether  PSEG  provided 
information  sufficient  for  the  staff  to  perform  its  independent  assessment  of  the  environmental 
impacts  of  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  PSEG  expects  that  the 
PPE  values  will  bound  the  design  characteristics  of  a  reactor  or  reactors  that  might  be 
constructed  at  the  PSEG  Site.  At  the  COL  stage,  as  required  by  10  CFR  52.79  (TN251 ),  the 
applicant  must,  in  addition  to  the  information  and  analysis  otherwise  required,  submit 
information  sufficient  to  demonstrate  that  the  design  of  the  facility  falls  within  the  parameters 
specified  in  the  ESP.  In  accordance  with  10  CFR  51.92(e)(7)  (TN250),  the  COL  supplemental 
EIS  must  analyze  new  and  significant  information  demonstrating  that  the  design  of  the  facility 
falls  outside  the  design  parameters  specified  in  the  ESP. 

Tables  3.3-1,  3.4-1,  and  3.4-2  from  the  PSEG  Environmental  Report  (ER)  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280)  and  Table  1.3-1  from  the  PSEG  Site  Safety  Analysis  Report  (SSAR)  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4283)  provide  information  from  various  reactor  designs  that  were  used  to  develop  the 
bounding  site-specific  PPE  values.  The  PPE  values  provided  in  these  tables  are  used  in  the 
staffs  analysis  and  are  reproduced  in  Appendix  I  of  the  EIS  unless  specifically  noted  otherwise. 

Throughout  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  PSEG  provides 

•  statements  of  plans  to  address  certain  issues  in  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  of

•  statements  of  planned  compliance  with  current  laws,  regulations,  and  requirements; 

•  statements  of  plans  for  future  activities  and  actions  that  it  will  take  should  it  decide  to  apply 
for  a  CP  or  COL; 

•  descriptions  of  the  PSEG  estimate  of  the  environmental  impacts  resulting  from  the 
construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site;  and 

•  descriptions  of  PSEG  estimates  of  future  activities  and  actions  of  others  and  the  likely 
environmental  impacts  of  those  activities  and  actions  that  would  be  expected  should  PSEG 
decide  to  apply  for  a  CP  or  COL. 

The  activities  described  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  actions  such  as  the  following: 

•  considering  the  results  of  testing  and  monitoring  during  the  development  of  a  CP  or  COL 
application; 

•  complying  with  the  NRC  regulations  and  those  of  other  agencies,  including  obtaining 
appropriate  permits  from  other  agencies;

•  taking  actions  to  mitigate  adverse  environmental  impacts  (e.g.,  best  management  practices); 
and 

•  addressing  certain  issues  at  the  CP  or  COL  stage  that  were  not  addressed  in  the  ESP 
application. 

Some  of  these  future  actions  are  those  that  PSEG  would  be  required  to  implement  because 
they  are  currently  required  by  law,  and  others  are  actions  that  PSEG  has  indicated  that  it  would 
implement  without  the  legal  obligation  to  take  such  actions. 

As  discussed  previously,  the  staff  developed  assumptions  necessary  to  evaluate  impacts  to 
certain  environmental  resources  to  account  for  missing  detailed  information.  In  addition  to  other 
sources  of  information  obtained  independently,  the  staff  considered  future  activities  and  actions, 
estimates  of  expected  environmental  impacts  that  were  identified  in  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280),  and  the  PPE  values  listed  in  Appendix  I  of  this  EIS  when  developing  the  inputs  and 
assumptions  used  in  the  NRC  staff  s  independent  review  of  the  environmental  impacts  of 
constructing  and  operating  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

3.2.1  Plant  Water  Use 

This  EIS  assesses  the  impacts  of  plant  water  use  based  on  the  values  of  design  parameters 
provided  in  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  At  the  ESP  stage,  the  staff  s  review  of  the 
design  parameters  is  limited  to  an  evaluation  of  whether  the  parameter  values  are  not 
unreasonable.  At  the  CP  or  COL  stage,  a  CP  or  COL  applicant  referencing  the  ESP  is  required 
to  demonstrate  that  the  specific  plant  design  would  fall  within  the  design  parameters  in  the  ESP. 
The  following  sections  describe  both  the  consumptive  and  nonconsumptive  water  uses  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  and  the  associated  plant  water  treatment  systems. 

Water  would  be  required  to  support  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  during  construction  and 
operation,  including  the  cooling  water  systems  for  plant  auxiliary  components  (e.g.,  SWS)  and 
makeup  water  for  the  ultimate  heat  sink  (UHS)  cooling  system.  The  majority  of  the  water  would 
be  withdrawn  from  the  Delaware  River  via  an  intake  structure.  The  bounding  cooling  water 
systems  flows  were  determined  for  site-specific  Delaware  River  water  quality  and  PSEG  Site 
meteorological  conditions,  and  the  bounding  SWS  flows  were  modified  for  site-specific  river 
water  quality.  The  freshwater  aquifer  would  supply  water  for  general  site  purposes  including  the 
potable  and  sanitary  water  system  (PSWS),  demineralized  water  distribution  system  (DWDS), 
fire  protection  system  (FPS),  and  other  miscellaneous  systems. 

3.2. 7. 7  Plant  Water  Consumption 

The  average  and  maximum  water  consumption  and  discharge  by  the  various  cooling  and  other 
water  systems  is  given  in  Table  3-1 .  This  includes  maximum  and  average  makeup  water  flow 
rates,  evaporation  rates,  drift  rates,  and  blowdown  rates  for  the  CWS  and  SWS  and  water 
supply  for  the  PSWS,  DWDS,  and  FPS.  Also  included  is  the  discharge  flow  rate  for  applicable 
systems,  including  miscellaneous  drains  and  liquid  radwaste.  The  average  values  are  the 
expected  limiting  values  for  normal  plant  operation,  and  the  maximum  values  are  those 
expected  for  upset  or  abnormal  conditions.  The  makeup  water  supply  source  for  the  CWS  and 
the  SWS/UHS  is  the  Delaware  River.  For  the  PSWS,  DWDS,  FPS,  and  other  miscellaneous 
systems,  plant  makeup  flows  are  from  an  onsite  freshwater  aquifer.  The  blowdown  and

discharge  water  flow  is  discharged  to  the  Delaware  River.  Figure  3-2  provides  a  water  balance 
diagram.  The  total  intake  from  the  Delaware  River  would  be  78,196  gpm  (average)  and 
80,600  gpm  (maximum).  The  total  intake  from  the  freshwater  aquifer  would  be  210  gpm 
(average)  and  953  gpm  (maximum).

Figure  3-2.  Plant  Water  Use  (Source:  Modified  by  staff  from  PSEG  2015-TN4280) 

The  CWS  and  SWS/UHS  cooling  towers  would  lose  water  from  evaporation,  blowdown,  and 
drift.  Evaporation,  blowdown,  and  drift  estimates  for  the  CWS  and  SWS/UHS  cooling  towers 
are  shown  in  Table  3-1.  Cooling  tower  performance  curves  have  not  yet  been  generated;  thus  a 
single  design  point  is  used  to  determine  CWS  parameters.  The  normal  operating  design  point 
for  the  cooling  tower  is  based  on  a  1  percent  maximum  annual  non-coincident  wet  bulb 
temperature  of  76.6°F.  No  seasonal  variability  is  evaluated  in  the  water  consumption  values 
presented.  Seasonal  variability  in  wet  and  dry  bulb  temperature  and  relative  humidity  results  in 
changes  to  cold  water  temperature,  system  flow  rates,  and,  ultimately,  evaporation  rates  from 
the  cooling  tower.  Historically,  the  NDCT  that  provides  heat  dissipation  for  the  HCGS  CWS 
produces  higher  evaporation  rates  in  the  summer  months  than  the  winter  months.  The  design 
point  noted  above  is  representative  of  a  1  percent  exceedance  summer  condition  at  the  PSEG 
Site.  As  such,  the  normal  operating  design  values  presented  for  water  use  at  the  new  plant  are 
conservative  when  considered  from  an  annual  use  perspective. 

The  combined  plant  blowdown  would  consist  of  CWS  blowdown,  SWS/UHS  blowdown,  PSWS 
blowdown,  DWDS  blowdown,  miscellaneous  drain  blowdowns,  liquid  radwaste  blowdown,  and 
SWS/UHS  makeup  filter  backwash.  The  combined  plant  blowdown  flows  would  discharge  into 
the  Delaware  River  at  a  flow  rate  of  51 ,946  gpm  (average)  and  53,222  gpm  (maximum). 

The  CWS  functions  as  the  heat  sink  for  normal  plant  processes  and  is  essential  to  power 
generation.  It  provides  a  continuous  supply  of  cooling  water  from  the  normal  plant  heat  sink  to 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


the  main  condensers  to  remove  the  heat  rejected  by  the  turbine  cycle.  The  main  condenser 
receives  exhaust  steam  from  the  turbines  and  cooled  water  is  pumped  from  the  cooling  tower 
through  the  main  condenser  and  back  to  the  cooling  tower,  where  heat  is  rejected  to  the 
atmosphere  by  evaporation.  The  CWS  also  accommodates  heat  loads  associated  with  turbine 
auxiliary  equipment. 

For  those  plant  designs  (i.e. ,  ABWR,  US-APWR,  U.S.  EPR)  that  use  active  safety-related  SWS 
and  UHS  cooling  towers,  the  SWS  provides  essential  cooling  to  safety-related  equipment  and 
may  also  cool  non-safety-related  auxiliary  components  used  for  normal  plant  operation.  It 
removes  heat  from  plant  components  by  providing  cooling  water  flow  during  normal  operation, 
during  safe  shutdown  of  the  reactor,  and  following  a  design  basis  accident.  Cooling  water  from 
the  UHS  cooling  towers  is  provided  to  the  component  cooling  water  system  heat  exchangers, 
emergency  diesel  generator  heat  exchangers,  and  pump  room  coolers  that  are  necessary  for 
normal  safe  shutdown  and  cooldown,  anticipated  operational  events,  and  accident  conditions. 
The  API 000  design  does  not  require  an  active  external  safety-related  UHS  system  to  reach 
safe  shutdown.  It  uses  a  non-safety-related  SWS  to  accommodate  plant  heat  loads. 

Additional  plant  systems  require  freshwater.  The  PSWS  supplies  water  needed  for  plant 
operation,  including  potable  water,  sanitary  water,  and  miscellaneous  systems.  The  DWDS 
supplies  makeup  water  of  reactor  coolant  quality  and  treated  water  for  other  station  operating 
requirements,  including  reactor  coolant  makeup.  The  FPS  supplies  water  to  the  wet  system 
type  fire  suppression  systems. 

Plant  water  use  during  construction  activities  would  require  freshwater  for  potable  and  sanitary 
use,  concrete  mixing  and  curing,  and  dust  control.  The  total  freshwater  requirement  for 
construction  would  be  171 ,932  gpd  or  1 19  gpm.  Of  this,  the  sanitary  discharge  would  be 
123,000  gpd  or  85  gpm.  The  remainder  of  the  supply  would  be  consumed.  These  construction 
flows  are  bounded  by  the  higher  total  freshwater  requirements  and  potable  and  sanitary  flows 
during  operation. 

3. 2. 1.2  Plant  Water  Treatment 

Treatment  systems  are  required  for  systems  supplied  by  surface  water  and  groundwater, 
including  circulating  water  makeup,  reactor  water  makeup,  service  water  makeup,  condensate, 
potable  water,  radwaste,  and  fire  protection.  The  majority  of  the  water  would  be  withdrawn  from 
the  Delaware  River  via  the  intake  structure.  The  intake  structure  would  be  located  at  Delaware 
River  River  Mile  (RM)  52,  situated  in  the  tidal  estuary  zone  of  the  Delaware  River,  where  it 
would  be  subject  to  tidal  saltwater  intrusion,  and  at  the  turbidity  maxima  on  the  Delaware  River. 
The  water  is  hard  and  brackish  with  elevated  levels  of  total  dissolved  solids  and  chlorides, 
elevated  levels  of  both  calcium  and  magnesium,  and  moderately  high  suspended  solids  levels. 

The  source  of  raw  water  makeup  for  the  CWS  would  be  the  Delaware  River.  Sulfuric  acid  would 
be  used  to  control  calcite  scale  as  required,  and  acid  addition  would  maintain  a  slightly  alkaline 
pH  level.  This  is  typical  when  using  tidal  estuary  water  makeup  and  is  consistent  with  the 
operational  experience  at  the  adjacent  HCGS.  The  combination  of  low  cycles  of  concentration 
and  acid  addition  would  be  used  so  that  other  scale  inhibitors  would  not  be  needed. 

Chlorination  would  control  microbial  growth  in  the  piping  and  condenser  to  prevent  biofouling 


NUREG-2168 


3-10 


November  2015 


Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


and  microbiological  deposits.  Sodium  hypochlorite  solution  would  be  used  to  control  biofouling 
and  would  be  limited  by  New  Jersey  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System  (NJPDES)  permit 
requirements.  Dechlorination  of  CWS  cooling  tower  blowdown  may  be  required  by  the  NJPDES 
permit.  A  sodium  bisulfite  solution  or  equivalent  would  be  injected  as  necessary  to  react  with 
residual  chlorine  before  discharge. 

The  source  of  raw  water  makeup  for  the  SWS/UHS  would  be  the  Delaware  River.  The  river 
water  would  be  treated  to  remove  suspended  solids  by  settling  in  clarifiers.  The  influent  would 
be  coagulated  and  flocculated  with  polyelectrolyte  addition  to  increase  sedimentation  rates  and 
improve  effluent  quality.  Settled  sludge  would  be  dewatered  for  disposal  using  mechanical 
dewatering  facilities  or  in  a  managed  impoundment.  Media  filters,  downstream  of  the  clarifiers, 
and  filter  backwash  may  be  used  to  provide  additional  suspended  solids  removal.  More 
comprehensive  chemical  treatment  would  be  provided  for  the  SWS/UHS.  The  river  water  would 
require  control  of  calcite  scale  and  control  of  iron  and  sediment  deposition.  Treatment 
chemicals  would  include  sulfuric  acid,  an  additional  blended  deposit  control  agent,  and  an 
oxidizing  biocide.  Sulfuric  acid  would  be  used  for  pH  reduction  to  aid  in  calcium  carbonate  scale 
control.  A  deposit  control  agent  would  be  used  to  control  calcium  carbonate  scaling,  to  protect 
against  calcium  phosphate  scaling,  and  to  control  silt  and  iron  deposition.  Sodium  hypochlorite 
solution  would  be  used  to  control  biofouling.  Dechlorination  of  SWS/UHS  cooling  tower 
blowdown  may  be  required  by  the  NJPDES  permit.  A  sodium  bisulfite  solution  or  equivalent 
would  be  injected  as  necessary  to  react  with  residual  chlorine  before  discharge. 

The  source  for  plant  makeup  water  for  the  PSWS,  DWDS,  FPS,  and  other  miscellaneous 
systems  would  be  the  onsite  freshwater  aquifer.  Makeup  water  for  the  PSWS  and  the  FPS 
would  not  be  treated.  Chlorination  would  be  provided  for  the  PSWS.  The  DWDS  makeup  water 
would  use  a  demineralization  treatment  system  such  as  a  dedicated  reverse  osmosis  system  to 
reduce  solids,  salts,  organics,  and  colloids  in  the  treated  water. 

3.2.2  Proposed  Plant  Structures 

This  EIS  assesses  the  impacts  of  proposed  plant  structures  based  on  the  values  of  design 
parameters  provided  in  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  At  the  ESP  stage,  the  staff’s 
review  of  the  design  parameters  is  limited  to  an  evaluation  of  whether  the  parameter  values  are 
not  unreasonable.  At  the  CP  or  COL  stage,  a  CP  or  COL  applicant  referencing  the  ESP  is 
required  to  demonstrate  that  the  specific  plant  design  would  fall  within  the  design  parameters  in 
the  ESP.  The  following  sections  describe  each  of  the  major  plant  structures:  the  reactor  power 
conversion  system,  structures  that  would  have  a  significant  interface  with  the  environment 
during  operation,  and  the  balance  of  plant  structures.  All  of  these  structures  are  relevant  in  the 
Chapter  4  discussion  of  the  impacts  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Only  the  structures 
that  interface  with  the  environment  are  important  to  the  operational  impacts  discussed  in 
Chapter  5. 

3. 2. 2. 7  Reactor  Po  wer  Con  version  System 

This  section  provides  a  general  discussion  of  the  reactor,  engineered  safety  features  (ESFs), 
and  the  power  conversion  system.  Reactor-specific  design  parameters  such  as  fuel  assembly 
description,  core  fuel  capacity,  and  condenser  total  heat  transfer  area  would  be  provided  during

NUREG-2168 


Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


the  COL  application  phase  following  reactor  technology  selection.  Bounding  parameters  from 
the  PPE  and  site-specific  characteristics  within  the  SSAR  (PSEG  2015-TN4283)  are  used  to 
establish  conceptual  reactor  descriptions. 

The  four  reactor  types  considered  for  the  new  plant  are  the  ABWR,  the  API 000,  the  U.S.  EPR, 
and  the  US-APWR.  The  API  000  plant  consists  of  two  units  and  associated  turbines  and  power 
conversion  equipment,  and  the  ABWR,  U.S.  EPR,  and  US-APWR  consist  of  one  unit  and 
associated  turbine  and  power  conversion  equipment.  The  ABWR  is  a  BWR,  and  the  API  000, 
U.S.  EPR,  and  US-APWR  are  PWRs.  The  design  life  for  a  new  facility  is  60  years  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4283),  and  the  initial  licensed  operating  life  is  40  years  based  on  the  Atomic  Energy  Act 
(42  USC  2011  et  seq.  -TN663)  and  current  regulations. 

The  rated  thermal  power  (RTP)  of  4,590  MW(t)  is  the  bounding  RTP  for  one  unit  and 
6,800  MW(t)  for  two  units  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  The  approximate  gross  and  net  electrical 
outputs  for  one  unit  are  1,710  MW(e)  and  1 ,600  MW(e),  respectively,  for  the  bounding  design. 
The  bounding  design  gross  and  net  electrical  outputs  for  two  units  are  about  2,400  MW(e)  and 
2,200  MW(e),  respectively. 

All  proposed  reactor  designs  use  uranium  as  the  fissile  material.  The  maximum  uranium 
enrichment  is  5  weight  percent  of  uranium-235  for  the  initial  fuel  load  (PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

The  maximum  average  assembly  discharge  burnup  is  54,200  MWd/MTU  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283). 
The  peak  fuel  rod  burnup  is  62,000  MWd/MTU  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  Each  of  these  values  is 
within  acceptable  NRC  limits. 

The  proposed  reactor  designs  use  active  and/or  passive  types  of  ESF  systems.  Active  systems 
rely  on  active  components  such  as  pumps  to  move  coolant  to  the  needed  locations,  while 
passive  systems  use  gravity  and  thermal  convection  to  achieve  equivalent  results.  Active 
systems  are  typically  powered  by  redundant  power  sources  such  as  emergency  diesel 
generators  or  gas  turbine  generators.  Passive  systems  use  gravity  to  move  coolant,  and  valves 
are  typically  actuated  by  safety-related  DC  power.  The  selected  design  would  rely  on  a  UHS  to 
remove  heat  from  safety-related  systems  and  discharge  it  to  the  atmosphere. 

The  power  conversion  system  for  each  of  the  advanced  reactor  designs  under  consideration 
uses  a  steam  turbine  to  generate  power  by  converting  the  reactor  heat  to  mechanical  energy. 
The  turbines  reject  exhaust  heat  to  the  normal  plant  cooling  water  system.  The  tube  material  for 
the  condenser  or  turbine  exhaust  cooling  heat  exchangers  has  not  been  selected. 

3. 2. 2. 2  Structures  with  a  Major  Environmental  Interface 

The  NRC  staff  divided  the  plant  structures  into  two  primary  groups:  those  that  interface  with  the 
environment  and  those  that  are  internal  to  the  reactor  and  associated  facilities  but  without  direct 
interaction  with  the  environment.  Examples  of  interfaces  with  the  environment  are  withdrawal  of 
water  from  the  environment  at  the  intake  structure,  release  of  water  to  the  environment  at  the 
discharge  structure,  and  release  of  excess  heat  to  the  atmosphere.  The  structures  or  locations 
with  environmental  interfaces  are  considered  in  the  staffs  assessment  of  the  environmental 
impacts  of  facility  construction  and  preconstruction  and  facility  operation  in  Chapters  4  and  5, 
respectively.  The  power-production  processes  that  would  occur  within  the  plant  itself  and  that 


NUREG-2168

did  not  affect  the  environment  are  not  relevant  to  a  National  Environmental  Policy  Act 
(42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661)  review  and  are  not  discussed  further  in  this  EIS.  However,  such 
internal  processes  are  considered  by  the  NRC  in  reactor-specific  design  certification 
documentation  and  in  the  NRC  safety  review  of  COL  applications. 

Cooling  Water  System 

The  cooling  water  system  for  the  new  plant  would  consist  of  a  CWS  and  an  SWS.  The  CWS 
would  provide  cooling  water  for  the  normal  heat  sink  that  would  consist  of  a  closed-loop  system 
composed  of  wet  cooling  towers,  water  pumps,  and  cooling  tower  basins.  The  circulating  water 
flow  rate  for  the  bounding  CWS  configuration  is  1.2  million  gpm.  The  CWS  heat  dissipation 
would  be  1.508  x  1010  Btu/hr.  The  CWS  cooling  towers  would  use  mechanical  draft,  natural 
draft,  or  fan-assisted  natural  draft  design.  The  cooling  towers  would  be  located  north  of  the 
power  block  area  of  the  plant  in  a  50-ac  area  (Figure  2-2).  The  CWS  makeup  water  average 
and  maximum  flow  would  be  75,792  gpm,  and  the  CWS  blowdown  average  and  maximum  flow 
rate  would  be  50,516  gpm. 

The  SWS  for  the  new  plant  would  remove  heat  from  the  balance  of  plant  auxiliary  equipment 
and  heat  exchangers  that  were  not  cooled  by  the  CWS.  All  reactor  designs  being  considered  by 
PSEG  for  the  site  contain  an  SWS.  The  SWS  for  the  ABWR.  US-APWR,  and  U.S.  EPR  designs 
performs  both  safety  and  nonsafety  cooling,  whereas  the  SWS  for  the  API  000  design  only 
performs  nonsafety  cooling.  The  SWS  design  is  specific  to  reactor  design  but  generally 
consists  of  cooling  towers,  water  pumps,  dedicated  water  basins,  and  heat  exchangers. 

Because  PSEG  has  used  a  PPE  approach,  a  safety-related  SWS  using  mechanical  draft 
cooling  towers  would  be  the  bounding  PPE  design  in  use  for  the  plant.  The  SWS  cooling 
towers  would  be  located  in  the  power  block  area.  The  UHS  heat  removal  requirement  is 
2.06  *  108  Btu/hr  during  normal  conditions,  4.72  *  108  Btu/hr  during  cooldown  conditions,  and 
3.95  x  108  Btu/hr  during  accident  conditions.  The  SWS  makeup  water  average  and  maximum 
flow  rates  would  be  2,404  and  4,808  gpm,  respectively,  and  the  SWS  blowdown  average  and 
maximum  flow  rates  would  be  1,140  and  2,280  gpm,  respectively.  The  UHS  makeup  water  flow 
rate  during  emergencies  would  be  4,568  gpm. 

The  combined  makeup  water  withdrawal  from  the  Delaware  River  would  average  78,196  gpm 
with  a  maximum  of  80,600  gpm.  The  combined  plant  blowdown,  including  CWS  and  SWS 
blowdowns,  SWS  makeup  filter  backwash,  and  plant  blowdown,  would  average  51,946  gpm 
with  a  maximum  flow  rate  of  53,222  gpm. 

Operational  Modes 

The  CWS  would  provide  cooling  functions  during  the  power  generation  mode.  The  CWS  would 
operate  at  its  maximum  heat  dissipation  capacity  because  the  plant  would  normally  operate  at 
100  percent  of  its  thermal  rating. 

The  SWS  would  provide  cooling  functions  during  power  generation,  cooldown,  refueling,  and 
plant  startup  modes.  In  addition,  the  SWS  may  also  provide  cooling  for  the  spent  fuel  pool  heat 
load  during  a  full  core  offload  condition.  Because  the  power  generation  mode  uses  the  most 
makeup  water,  all  other  mode  water  uses  are  bounded  by  the  power  generation  mode.

Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


Station  Capacity  Factor 

The  annualized  capacity  factor  for  the  plant  would  be  between  85  and  96.3  percent.  These 
values  are  bounding  for  the  purposes  of  different  analyses  performed  for  the  environmental 
review. 

Cooling  Water  Intake  System 

A  new  makeup  water  intake  structure  would  be  located  west  of  the  plant  on  the  Delaware  River 
shoreline  about  2,800  ft  north  of  the  HCGS  service  water  intake  structure  (Figure  2-2).  To  meet 
the  bounding  CWS  and  SWS  combined  makeup  water  demands  for  the  reactor  designs  being 
considered  for  the  PSEG  Site,  the  intake  structure  would  be  about  200  ft  wide  (facing  the 
Delaware  River  shoreline)  and  1 10  ft  deep  (extending  from  the  shoreline  landward).  The 
Delaware  River  in  front  of  the  intake  structure  would  need  to  be  dredged  to  an  elevation  of 
-19  ft  10  in.  NAVD88  (North  American  Vertical  Datum  of  1988)  to  allow  sufficient  depth  for 
water  withdrawal.  A  bar  rack  would  prevent  debris  from  entering  the  intake  bays,  and  a  trash 
rake  would  clean  the  debris  accumulated  on  the  bar  rack.  A  traveling  screen  would  prevent 
small  debris  from  reaching  farther  into  the  bays.  The  intake  structure  bay  and  screens  would  be 
sized  such  that  the  average  intake  through-screen  velocity  would  be  less  than  0.5  fps  to  meet 
the  requirements  of  the  Clean  Water  Act  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  Section  316(b)  Phase  I 
rule  (66  FR  65256-TN243). 

Discharge  System 

The  plant  discharge  would  consist  of  CWS  and  SWS  blowdowns,  SWS  makeup  filter  backwash, 
and  other  wastewater  streams  including  those  from  PSWSs,  demineralized  water  systems, 
miscellaneous  drains  blowdowns,  and  liquid  radwaste  flow.  The  combined  plant  discharge 
would  average  51 ,946  gpm  with  a  maximum  of  53,222  gpm.  An  NJPDES  permit  for  the  plant 
would  specify  volumes  and  constituent  concentrations  of  the  plant  discharge. 

The  discharge  system  would  consist  of  a  48-in. -diameter  pipe  located  about  8,000  ft  north  of  the 
existing  SGS  discharge,  2,500  ft  north  of  the  existing  HCGS  discharge,  and  1,000  ft  north  of  the 
makeup  water  intake  structure  of  the  plant.  The  discharge  pipe  would  extend  out  100  ft  into  the 
Delaware  River  from  the  shoreline  and  would  rest  on  a  layer  of  geotextile  fabric  and  granular 
bedding.  The  outlet  of  the  discharge  pipe  would  be  elevated  3  ft  above  the  river  bed,  and  the 
depth  of  water  at  the  outlet  would  be  1 2  ft  1 0  in.  below  mean  low  water.  The  discharge  pipe 
would  be  overlaid  with  geotextile  fabric  and  a  three-layered  granular  material  for  stability. 

Cooling  Towers 

The  plant  would  use  one  or  two  wet  cooling  towers  to  dissipate  waste  heat.  As  described 
above,  the  CWS  cooling  towers  would  use  mechanical  draft,  natural  draft,  or  fan-assisted 
natural  draft  design.  Makeup  water  to  offset  the  losses  from  evaporation,  blowdown,  and  drift 
would  be  provided  from  the  Delaware  River  via  the  new  intake  system.  Blowdown  from  the 
cooling  towers  would  be  discharged  to  the  Delaware  River  via  the  new  discharge  system.  The 
PPE  values  for  the  CWS  average  and  maximum  evaporation  loss  are  25,264  gpm  and  the 
average  and  maximum  drift  loss  are  12  gpm. 


NUREG-2168 


3-14 


November  2015 


Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


As  described  above,  the  SWS  cooling  towers  would  be  a  mechanical  draft  design.  Makeup 
water  for  the  SWS  cooling  towers  would  also  be  provided  from  the  Delaware  River  via  the  new 
intake  system,  and  blowdown  from  the  towers  would  be  discharged  to  the  Delaware  River  using 
the  new  discharge  system.  The  SWS  average  and  maximum  evaporation  losses  would  be 
1,142  and  2,284  gpm,  respectively,  and  the  average  and  maximum  drift  losses  would  be  2  and 
4  gpm,  respectively. 

Water  Treatment 


The  surface  water  withdrawn  from  the  Delaware  River  to  offset  evaporation,  blowdown,  and  drift 
losses  in  the  cooling  system  would  require  treatment.  Near  the  intake  structure  at  Delaware 
River  RM  52,  the  Delaware  River  is  subject  to  tidal  fluctuations  and  turbidity  maxima.  The  water 
of  the  Delaware  River  at  this  location  is  hard  and  brackish  and  would  have  elevated  levels  of 
suspended  and  total  dissolved  solids,  chlorides,  calcium,  and  magnesium. 

For  the  CWS,  sulfuric  acid  would  be  added  to  the  raw  water  withdrawn  from  the  Delaware  River 
to  control  calcite  scale  formation.  Chlorination  would  be  used  to  control  microbial  growth  and 
biofouling.  Sodium  hypochlorite  would  also  be  used  to  control  biofouling  and  would  be  subject 
to  NJPDES  permit  requirements.  The  NJPDES  permit  may  also  require  dechlorination  of  the 
CWS  blowdown  before  discharge,  which  may  be  carried  out  using  a  sodium  bisulfite  solution  or 
equivalent  to  control  residual  chlorine. 

For  the  SWS,  the  raw  water  withdrawn  from  the  Delaware  River  would  be  passed  through 
clarifiers  to  remove  suspended  solids.  The  clarifiers  may  use  polyelectrolyte  to  increase 
coagulation  and  flocculation.  Media  filters  may  be  used  to  remove  additional  suspended  solids 
after  the  raw  water  passes  through  the  clarifiers.  Sulfuric  acid,  additional  blended  deposit 
control  agent,  and  sodium  hypochlorite  would  be  used  to  reduce  pH  for  scaling  control,  to 
control  calcium  carbonate  and  calcium  phosphate  scaling,  and  to  control  biofouling.  A  sodium 
bisulfite  solution  or  equivalent  may  be  used  to  control  residual  chlorine  before  discharge  of  the 
blowdown  from  the  SWS  cooling  towers. 

Plant  makeup  water  to  the  PSWS,  DWDS,  FPS,  and  other  miscellaneous  uses  would  be 
provided  by  onsite  freshwater  withdrawn  from  the  aquifer.  Makeup  water  for  the  PSWS  and 
FPS  would  not  be  treated  except  for  chlorination  for  the  PSWS.  Makeup  water  for  the  DWDS 
would  use  a  demineralization  treatment  system  such  as  a  reverse  osmosis  system  to  reduce 
solids,  salts,  organics,  and  colloids  from  the  raw  freshwater. 

Power  Transmission  System 

The  new  plant  would  be  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS.  The  electric  power 
systems  for  these  existing  plants  generate  and  transmit  power  into  the  PJM  power  grid.  PJM  is 
a  regional  transmission  organization  that  manages  the  high  voltage  power  grid  and  coordinates 
the  movement  of  wholesale  electricity  in  a  market  that  serves  1 3  states  and  the  District  of 
Columbia. 

HCGS  and  SGS  have  separate,  dedicated  switchyards.  Both  switchyards  operate  nominally  at 
500  kV.  The  switching  station  designs  at  each  plant  incorporate  a  breaker-and-a-half  scheme 
for  high  reliability.  A  new  plant  switchyard  would  be  required  to  support  new  plant  operation. 

The  new  plant  switchyard  would  be  electrically  integrated  with  the  existing  switchyards  via  a  site 


November  2015 


3-15 


NUREG-2168 


Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


interposing  switchyard  to  provide  500-kV  connections.  Electric  power  generated  by  the  new 
plant  would  be  fed  through  isolated  phase  buses  to  main  transformer  banks  where  it  would  be 
stepped  up  to  500  kV  and  delivered  to  the  new  plant  switchyard.  The  bounding  land  use 
required  within  the  PSEG  Site  for  the  switchyards  is  63  ac  (SSAR  Table  1.3-1,  Item  15.1.1 
[PSEG  2015-TN4283]).  The  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  shown  in  Figure  2-2  depicts  the  relative 
locations  of  the  switchyards. 

The  configuration  of  the  new  switchyards  is  dependent  on  the  reactor  technology,  number  of 
units,  and  approach  for  integration  with  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS  switchyards.  The  new 
switchyards  would  require  additional  support  services  and  structures  for  grounding,  lightning 
protection,  switchyard  control  power,  and  area  lighting. 

Presently,  there  are  two  500-kV  transmission  lines  to  the  HCGS  switchyard  from  offsite 
locations  and  one  500-kV  tie  line  from  HCGS  to  the  SGS  switchyard.  One  offsite  line  is  a  17-mi 
tie  to  the  Red  Lion  Substation,  located  northwest  near  Newark,  Delaware,  and  the  other  line  is  a 
43-mi  tie  to  the  New  Freedom  Switching  Station,  located  northeast  in  Camden  County,  New 
Jersey.  All  three  lines  are  capable  of  providing  physically  independent  sources  of  offsite  power 
to  HCGS. 

In  addition,  there  are  two  500-kV  transmission  lines  to  the  SGS  switchyard  from  off  the  site  and 
one  500-kV  tie  line  from  SGS  to  the  HCGS  switchyard.  One  offsite  line  is  a  42-mi  tie  to  the  New 
Freedom  Switching  Station.  The  second  offsite  line  is  a  50-mi  tie  to  the  New  Freedom 
Switching  Station.  In  2008,  a  new  substation  (Orchard)  was  installed  along  this  line,  dividing  it 
into  two  segments.  All  three  lines  are  capable  of  providing  physically  independent  sources  of 
offsite  power  to  SGS  and  are  available  for  either  or  both  units. 

The  existing  transmission  lines  servicing  the  HCGS/SGS  site  have  adequate  thermal  capacity 
to  accommodate  the  additional  generation  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
Independent  of  this  project,  however,  PJM  is  evaluating  grid  improvements  to  address 
congestion  and  grid  stability  and  additional  offsite  transmission  lines  may  be  required. 

Access  Road 

PSEG  has  stated  that  additional  access  road  capacity  is  necessary  to  address  future 
transportation  needs  for  the  PSEG  Site.  To  provide  this  additional  access  road  capacity,  PSEG 
has  designed  a  new  three-lane  causeway  that  would  be  constructed  on  elevated  structures  for 
its  entire  length  through  the  coastal  wetlands.  The  proposed  causeway  would  extend  northeast 
for  about  5.0  mi  from  the  PSEG  property  along  or  adjacent  to  the  existing  transmission  corridor 
right-of-way  (ROW)  to  the  intersection  of  Money  Island  Road  and  Mason  Point  Road 
(Figure  2-5).  The  alignment  would  run  roughly  200  ft  east  of,  and  parallel  to,  the  existing  Hope 
Creek-Red  Lion  transmission  line  for  most  of  its  length.  The  PSEG  conceptual  design  for  the 
causeway  specifies  a  200-ft-wide  ROW  in  upland  areas  at  the  northern  and  southern  termini 
and  a  48-ft-wide  structure  for  the  elevated  portions  of  the  causeway  within  lowland  areas. 

Figure  3-3  provides  a  photo  simulation  of  the  existing  Hope  Creek-Red  Lion  transmission  line 
paralleled  by  the  proposed  causeway  through  the  Money  Island  Estuary.

Because  PSEG  has  determined  the  proposed  causeway  would  be  needed  to  support  the  new 
plant,  the  review  team  evaluated  the  impacts  of  the  proposed  causeway  as  part  of  the  project 
(Chapters  4,  5,  and  7  of  this  EIS). 

3.3  Construction  and  Preconstruction  Activities 

The  NRC  authority  is  limited  to  construction  activities  that  have  a  “reasonable  nexus  to 
radiological  health  and  safety  or  common  defense  and  security”  (72  FR  57416-TN260),  and  the 
NRC  has  defined  “construction”  within  the  context  of  its  regulatory  authority.  Examples  of 
construction  activities  (defined  at  10  CFR  50.10(a)  [TN249])  for  safety-related  structures, 
systems,  or  components  (SSCs)  include  driving  of  piles;  subsurface  preparation;  placement  of 
backfill,  concrete,  or  permanent  retaining  walls  within  an  excavation;  installation  of  foundations; 
or  in-place  assembly,  erection,  fabrication,  or  testing. 

Other  activities  related  to  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  that  do  not  require  NRC  approval, 
but  which  may  require  a  permit  from  the  USACE,  may  occur  before,  during,  or  after  the 
NRC-authorized  construction  activities.  These  activities  are  termed  “preconstruction”  in 
10  CFR  51.45(c)  (TN250)  and  may  be  regulated  by  other  local,  State,  Tribal,  or  Federal 
agencies.  Preconstruction  includes  activities  such  as  preparation  of  the  site  (e.g.,  site  clearing 
and  grading,  erosion  control,  and  other  environmental  mitigation  measures);  erection  of  fences; 
excavation;  erection  of  support  buildings;  creation  of  building  service  facilities  (e.g.,  roads, 
pipelines,  and  transmission  lines);  and  procurement  or  fabrication  of  components  occurring  at 
other  than  the  final,  in-place  location  at  the  site.  Further  information  about  the  delineation  of 
construction  and  preconstruction  activities  is  presented  in  Chapter  4  of  this  EIS. 

This  section  describes  the  structures  and  activities  associated  with  building  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  This  section  also  characterizes  the  major  activities  for  the 
principal  structures  to  provide  the  requisite  background  for  the  assessment  of  environmental 
impacts.  However,  it  does  not  represent  a  discussion  of  every  potential  activity  or  a  detailed 
engineering  plan. 

For  analysis,  PSEG  has  assumed  a  construction  schedule  based  on  the  two-unit  API  000 
reactor  technology  with  a  2016  construction  start  date  and  a  68-month  construction  schedule 
ending  in  2021  (Table  3-2)  (PSEG  2012-TN1489;  PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  PSEG  has  assumed  a 
targeted  commercial  operating  date  of  2021  for  the  first  unit  and  2022  for  the  second  unit 
(PSEG  2012-TN1489).  The  description  of  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  in  this 
section  assumes  that  construction  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  begin  following  site  preparation  for 
the  first  unit  and  that  construction  of  the  second  unit  would  begin  12  months  later. 

PSEG  has  not  yet  selected  a  specific  reactor  technology  for  the  site,  so  it  used  technical 
information  from  the  four  reactor  designs  covered  by  the  PPE  to  develop  bounding  parameters 
on  which  assessments  could  be  based  (PSEG  2012-TN1489).  These  bounding  parameters 
envelope  the  characteristics  of  the  proposed  facility  and  allow  for  an  evaluation  of  the  suitability 
of  the  site  for  future  construction  and  operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant.  Therefore,  the 
preconstruction  and  construction  activities  discussed  in  this  section  and  the  areas  depicted  on 
the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  (Figure  2-2)  are  intended  to  bound  the  assessment  of  onsite  and 
near  offsite  impacts.

3.3.1  Site  Preparation 

Site  preparation  would  include  clearing,  grubbing,  and  grading  the  site;  installing  erosion  control 
measures;  building  access  and  haul  roads;  installing  construction  security  infrastructure; 
installing  temporary  utilities  and  facilities  (e.g.,  storage  warehouses  and  the  concrete  batch 
plant);  preparing  the  laydown,  fabrication,  and  shop  areas;  relocating  existing  facilities  within  the 
PSEG  Site;  staging  equipment;  and  conducting  preparation  activities  to  support  power  plant 
construction.  Figure  2-2  depicts  the  locations  of  many  of  these  activities  based  on  the  PSEG 
Site  Utilization  Plan. 

Clearing  and  grubbing  the  site  would  begin  with  removing  the  vegetation.  The  site  grade  would 
then  be  made  uniform  to  ensure  access  to  all  areas  of  the  construction  site.  The  crosshatched 
areas  depicted  in  Figure  2-2  illustrate  the  areas  that  would  be  cleared,  grubbed,  and  graded 
(PSEG  2012-TN1489).

Erosion  control  measures  such  as  silt  fences  would  be  installed  around  the  various  work  areas 
to  prevent  surface-water  and  sediment  runoff.  Best  management  practices,  including  the 
establishment  of  a  stormwater  management  plan,  would  be  implemented  to  control  and  contain 
surface  runoff  (PSEG  2012-TN1489).  To  support  construction  at  the  PSEG  Site,  PSEG  would 
begin  building  the  proposed  causeway  (Section  2. 2. 2. 3  and  Section  3. 2. 2. 2,  Access  Road) 

24  months  before  plant  construction  (PSEG  2012-TN1489).  Building  the  causeway  would 
primarily  consist  of  driving  piles  from  a  top-down  or  parallel  temporary  structure  with 
prefabricated  roadway  spans  set  in  place  between  pile  clusters.  Most  of  the  causeway  structure 
would  be  made  of  prefabricated  elevated  sections  set  in  place  from  an  elevated  crane  to 
minimize  impacts  along  the  causeway  route.  PSEG  would  also  build  a  heavy  haul  road  along 
the  length  of  the  riverfront  west  of  the  site  (Figure  2-2)  to  support  the  transport  of  heavy 
modules  and  components  from  the  existing  HCGS  barge  facility  and  from  the  proposed  parallel 
barge  facility.  PSEG  would  build  temporary  construction  parking  lots  on  PSEG  property  in 
areas  near  the  construction  site.  Construction  laydown  and  fabrication  areas  would  be  cleared, 
grubbed,  graded,  and  graveled  or  paved  with  a  road  system  to  accommodate  the  site 
construction  traffic  (PSEG  2012-TN1489). 

Structures  and  equipment  needed  for  construction  site  security  would  include  access  control 
points,  fencing,  lighting,  physical  barriers,  and  guardhouses.  These  construction-level  security 
features  would  be  installed  during  the  early  part  of  site-preparation  activities  (PSEG  2012- 
TN1489). 

Temporary  utilities  needed  for  plant  construction  would  include  aboveground  and  underground 
infrastructure  for  power,  communications,  potable  water,  wastewater  and  waste  treatment 
facilities,  fire  protection,  and  construction  gas  and  air  systems.  These  temporary  utilities  would 
support  the  entire  construction  site  and  associated  activities,  including  construction  offices, 
warehouses,  storage  and  laydown  areas,  fabrication  and  maintenance  shops,  the  power  block, 
the  batch  plant  facility,  measuring  and  testing  equipment,  and  the  intake  and  discharge  areas. 
Temporary  construction  facilities  needed  would  include  offices,  warehouses  for  receiving  and 
storage,  temporary  workshops,  toilets,  training  facilities,  and  personnel  access  facilities.  The 
site  of  the  concrete  batch  plant  would  be  prepared  for  aggregate  unloading  and  storage,  and  the 
cement  storage  silos  and  concrete  batch  plant  would  be  erected  (PSEG  2012-TN1489). 

Activities  to  support  the  preparation  of  the  laydown,  fabrication,  and  shop  areas  would  include  a 
construction  survey  to  establish  local  coordinates  and  benchmarks  for  horizontal  and  vertical 
control;  grading,  stabilizing,  and  preparing  the  laydown  areas;  installing  construction  fencing; 
installing  shop  and  fabrication  areas,  including  the  concrete  slabs  for  formwork  laydown,  module 
assembly,  equipment  parking  and  maintenance,  fuel  and  lubricant  storage,  and  rigging  loft;  and 
installing  concrete  pads  for  cranes  and  crane  assembly  (PSEG  2012-TN1489). 

Preconstruction  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  include  some  limited  excavation  work 
because  structural  support  for  construction  excavation  would  be  installed  at  the  lateral  limits  of 
the  excavation  for  the  entire  power  block.  Structural  support  for  construction  excavation  could 
consist  of  cellular  cofferdams,  sheet  pile/tie-back  walls,  or  other  methods  that  would  be 
specified  in  a  COL.  Excavation  work  conducted  as  a  preconstruction  activity  would  be  to  a 
depth  of  about  50  ft  below  site  grade  (through  the  fill  and  alluvium)  (PSEG  2012-TN1489).

Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


As  described  in  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  and  based  on  New  Jersey  Department  of 
Environment  Protection  (NJDEP)  land  use  land  cover  (LULC)  classification  system,  the 
proposed  project  would  permanently  affect  58.3  ac  of  Phragmites  (common  reed)-dominant 
coastal  wetlands;  44.1  ac  of  Phragmites-tiominant  interior  wetlands;  11.7  ac  of  wetlands  ROW; 

4.6  ac  of  deciduous  scrub/shrub  wetlands;  4.0  ac  of  disturbed  wetlands  (modified);  2.9  ac  of 
tidal  rivers,  inland  bays,  and  other  tidal  waters;  0.9  ac  of  herbaceous  wetlands;  and  0.1  ac  of 
saline  marsh.  The  project  would  also  permanently  affect  40.3  ac  of  artificial  lakes. 

Jurisdictional  wetlands  (i.e.,  wetlands  regulated  by  the  USACE  under  Section  10  of  the  Rivers 
and  Harbors  Appropriations  Act  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  -TN660)  and  Section  404  of  the  CWA  [33 
USC  1251  et  seq  -TN662])  may  be  defined  and  identified  differently  than  wetlands  identified  as 
part  of  the  NJDEP  LULC  classification  system  and  are  subject  to  the  USACE  permitting 
requirements.  Therefore,  jurisdictional  wetlands  are  evaluated  separately  from  the  LULC 
analysis.  Because  the  USACE  uses  the  Cowardin  System  for  land-use  classification  of 
wetlands  and  waters,  the  overall  acreages  of  impacts  described  above  would  be  similar,  but 
may  not  be  identical,  to  the  acreage  calculations  for  the  USACE  values.  It  is  also  important  to 
note  that  the  habitat  condition  and  extent  of  wetlands  may  vary  with  time,  especially  in  modified 
or  disturbed  locations  (e.g.,  CDFs)  where  dredge  materials  are  being  deposited.  The  USACE 
has  prepared  and  approved  jurisdictional  determination  for  the  project  site  (USACE  2014- 
TN3282).  The  following  description  of  impacts  is  based  on  the  jurisdicational  wetlands 
determination. 

Building  materials  would  be  brought  to  the  site  and  stored  in  laydown  areas.  PSEG  expects  to 
use  six  temporary  laydown  areas  in  various  locations  on  the  site.  These  laydown  areas  would 
potentially  affect  9.1  ac  of  coastal  wetlands.  This  would  include  impacts  to  288  linear  ft  of  creek 
channel  (canal  ditch)  associated  with  one  laydown  area  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

PSEG  would  build  a  temporary  concrete  batch  plant  on  the  45-ac  parcel  to  be  leased  from  the 
USACE.  Building  this  batch  plant  would  potentially  affect  19.1  ac  of  coastal  wetlands 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

PSEG  would  build  a  heavy  haul  road  along  the  Delaware  River  shoreline  to  support  the 
movement  of  materials  from  the  temporary  laydown/batch  plant  area  within  the  45-ac  leased 
parcel  to  other  areas  of  the  construction  site.  Developing  this  haul  road  would  potentially  affect 

9.6  ac  of  coastal  wetlands.  Of  the  total  wetlands  affected  by  the  haul  road,  2.3  ac  would  only  be 
temporarily  affected  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Building  the  proposed  causeway  would  potentially  affect  1.8  ac  of  coastal  wetlands  on  the 
PSEG  Site.  Of  the  total  onsite  wetlands  affected  by  the  causeway,  0.9  ac  would  be  temporarily 
affected.  Potential  offsite  impacts  of  the  proposed  causeway  would  include  39.6  ac  of  coastal 
wetlands  and  1 .4  ac  of  freshwater  wetlands.  Of  the  total  offsite  wetlands  affected  by  the 
causeway,  19.6  ac  would  be  temporarily  affected.  Included  within  the  area  are  potential  impacts 
to  30  linear  ft  of  creek  channel  (stream)  on  the  site  and  2,123  linear  ft  of  creek  channel 
(stream/artificial  path)  off  the  site.  Actual  impacts  to  stream  channels  would  be  limited  to  pier 
locations  only,  and  stream  channels  would  most  likely  be  avoided  in  the  final  design 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).

3.3.2  Power  Block  Construction 

The  power  block  is  defined  as  all  SSCs  that  perform  a  direct  function  in  the  production, 
transport,  or  storage  of  heat  energy,  electrical  energy,  or  radioactive  wastes.  Also  included  are 
SSCs  that  monitor,  control,  protect,  or  otherwise  support  the  above  equipment  (PSEG  201 5- 
TN4283).  PSEG  states  that  70  ac  would  be  required  to  provide  space  for  the  power  block 
facilities  on  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

The  PSEG  Site  power  block  would  consist  of  an  area  encompassing  the  nuclear  island  and 
turbine  island  areas,  which  would  include  the  following  buildings  for  each  unit: 

•  reactor  building,  including  concrete  containment  vessel; 

•  power  source  buildings; 

•  UHS-related  structures; 

•  auxiliary  building; 

•  access  building;  and 

•  turbine  building. 

PSEG  developed  the  PPE  as  a  surrogate  plant  design  based  on  design  parameters  from  the 
API  000,  U.S.  EPR,  ABWR,  and  US-APWR,  under  consideration  for  the  site  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4283)  (Table  1-2  of  this  EIS).  Based  on  the  PPE,  PSEG  developed  a  general  layout  for  the 
limits  of  excavation  for  the  new  plant  location.  The  general  layout  identifies  a  power  block  area 
within  which  all  Seismic  Category  1  structures  for  any  of  the  four  technologies  would  be  located, 
excluding  the  outlying  Category  1  river  intake  structure  (if  required  by  the  specific  technology). 
As  a  preconstruction  activity,  PSEG  would  install  structural  support  for  excavation  at  the  lateral 
limits  of  the  construction  excavation  for  the  entire  power  block  (PSEG  201 2-TN 1489). 

Construction  excavation  (i.e.,  safety-related  excavation  for  Seismic  Category  1  structures) 
would  be  to  the  Vincentown  formation  foundation  level  (about  70  ft  below  site  grade)  and  would 
implement  a  second  set  of  structural  supports.  About  5  million  yd3  of  soil  would  be  excavated 
during  both  preconstruction  and  construction  of  the  two-unit  plant.  Material  that  cannot  be 
reused  in  the  excavation  would  be  retained  on  the  site.  PSEG  would  try  to  achieve  beneficial 
reuse  of  the  excavated  material  (PSEG  2012-TN1489). 

After  the  subsurface  preparations  have  been  completed  and  the  subgrade  has  been 
geologically  mapped,  the  foundations  would  be  installed.  The  reactor  building  basemat  would 
be  installed  first  because  it  is  the  deepest  structure.  The  detailed  steps  of  installing  the  reactor 
building  basemat  would  include  the  following: 

•  placement  of  backfill; 

•  installing  the  grounding  grid; 

•  forming  the  mud-mat  concrete  work  surface;  and 

•  reinforcing  steel  and  civil,  electrical,  mechanical/piping  embedded  items  (basemat  module) 
and  forming,  concrete  placement,  and  curing  (PSEG  2012-TN1489).

Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


Earthwork  for  the  construction  phase  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  involve  removing  unsuitable 
materials  (soils),  both  from  the  overall  power  block  area  and  from  below  the  Seismic  Category  1 
structures,  and  replacing  them  with  suitable  backfill  materials.  Two  categories  of  backfill  would 
be  used:  Category  1  and  Category  2.  Category  1  materials  would  be  placed  below  the 
basemat-bearing  grades  of  the  Category  1  structures  and  adjacent  to  the  below-grade  walls  of 
the  Category  1  structures.  Category  2  materials  would  extend  laterally  beyond  the  Category  1 
backfill  areas  out  to  the  lateral  limits  of  the  power  block  area.  The  lateral  and  vertical  extent  of 
the  excavation  for  the  Category  1  structures  within  the  roughly  70-ac  power  block  area  would 
depend  on  the  plant  technology  chosen  (PSEG  2012-TN1489). 

The  major  activities  associated  with  reactor  building  construction  (which  would  have  the  longest 
construction  duration  of  any  project  facility)  would  include 

•  erecting  the  reactor  concrete  containment  vessel  shell; 

•  placing  the  walls,  slabs,  and  reactor  pedestal; 

•  installing  the  reactor  vessel,  pool  modules,  and  primary  loop  components;  and 

•  setting  the  upper  reactor  building  roof  structure. 

The  mechanical;  piping;  heating,  ventilation,  and  air  conditioning;  and  electrical  installations 
would  begin  in  the  lower  elevations  of  the  reactor  building  and  would  continue  to  the  upper 
elevations  (PSEG  2012-TN1489). 

Turbine  building  construction  would  begin  with  the  pedestal  basement  and  buried  circulating 
water  piping  installation  followed  by  installation  of  the  pedestal  columns,  condenser  modules, 
and  pedestal  deck.  The  building  exterior  to  the  turbine  pedestal  would  be  erected,  and  then  the 
turbine  building  crane  and  the  exterior  walls  and  roof  would  be  installed.  The  turbine  and 
generator  would  be  assembled  inside  the  building  (PSEG  2012-TN1489). 

Support  facilities  that  would  be  constructed  within  the  power  block  include 

•  circulating  water  intake  and  discharge  structures, 

•  safety-related  piping  and  electrical  tunnels, 

•  UHS  structure, 

•  basin  and  pump  houses, 

•  machine  shop, 

•  fire  protection  pump  house, 

•  makeup  water  treatment  building, 

•  various  yard  tanks,  and 

•  laboratories  for  radiological  and  chemical  analyses  to  support  plant  operations  (PSEG  2012- 
TN1489). 

The  following  description  of  impacts  is  based  on  the  jurisdicational  wetlands  determination  as 
described  in  Section  3.3.1.  Power  block  construction  would  require  clearing  and  grading 
39.4  ac  of  coastal  wetlands.  This  would  include  1 ,335  linear  ft  of  creek  channel  (canal  ditch) 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).

Clearing  and  grading  an  area  for  the  proposed  cooling  tower  would  potentially  permanently 
affect  48.0  ac  of  coastal  wetlands.  This  would  include  1 ,280  linear  ft  of  creek  channel  (canal 
ditch)  and  1 ,187  linear  ft  of  creek  channel  (stream)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Construction  of  two  switchyards  would  require  clearing  and  grading  that  would  potentially 
permanently  affect  53.7  ac  of  coastal  wetlands.  Included  in  this  area  are  2,297  linear  ft  of  creek 
channel  (canal  ditch)  and  848  linear  ft  of  creek  channel  (stream)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Construction  of  the  new  cooling  water  intake  structure  would  require  lowering  the  Delaware 
River  bottom  by  4.5  ft  over  an  area  of  31  ac.  The  total  area  to  be  dredged  would  be  92  ac, 
extending  out  from  the  shoreline  1 ,700  ft,  or  1 3  percent  of  the  total  river  width  of  2.5  mi  in  this 
location.  Construction  of  the  intake  structure  features  along  the  Delaware  River  shoreline  would 
result  in  the  conversion  of  9.5  ac  of  riparian  zone  and  shallow  water  habitat  to  industrial  uses. 
The  intake  structure  would  potentially  permanently  affect  1 .5  ac  of  coastal  wetlands 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

3.3.3  Construction  Workforce 

PSEG  states  that  about  3,950  to  4,100  workers  would  be  on  the  site  for  construction  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  The  analyses  in  the  ER 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280)  assume  2016  as  the  construction  start  date  and  a  68-month  construction 
schedule  ending  in  2021. 

3.3.4  Summary  of  Resource  Commitments  During  Construction  and  Preconstruction 

Table  3-3  provides  a  list  of  the  significant  resource  commitments  associated  with  construction 
and  preconstruction.  The  values  in  the  table  combined  with  the  affected  environment  described 
in  Chapter  2  provide  the  basis  for  the  impacts  assessed  in  Chapter  4.  These  values  were 
stated  in  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  and  SSAR  (PSEG  2015-TN4283),  and  the  review 
team  has  confirmed  that  the  values  are  not  unreasonable.

3.4  Operational  Activities 


The  operational  activities  considered  in  the  staffs  environmental  review  are  those  associated 
with  structures  that  interface  with  the  environment.  Examples  of  operational  activities  are 
withdrawing  water  for  the  cooling  system,  discharging  blowdown  water  and  sanitary  effluent, 
and  discharging  waste  heat  to  the  atmosphere.  Safety  activities  within  the  plant  are  discussed 
by  PSEG  in  the  SSAR  portion  of  its  application  (PSEG  2015-TN4283)  and  are  reviewed  by  the 
NRC  in  its  safety  evaluation  report  (in  progress). 

The  following  sections  describe  the  operational  activities,  including  the  cooling  system  and  its 
operational  modes  (Section  3.4.1),  the  plant-environmental  interfaces  of  importance  during 
operation  (Section  3.4.2),  and  the  radioactive  and  nonradioactive  waste  management  systems 
(Sections  3.4.3  and  3.4.4). 

3.4.1  Description  of  Cooling  System  Operational  Modes 

The  operational  modes  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  considered  in  the  assessment  of 
operational  impacts  on  the  environment  (Chapter  5  of  this  EIS)  are  normal  operating  conditions 
and  emergency  shutdown  conditions.  These  are  the  nominal  conditions  under  which  maximum 
water  withdrawal,  heat  dissipation,  and  effluent  discharges  occur.  Cooldown,  refueling,  and 
accidents  are  alternative  modes  to  normal  plant  operation  during  which  water  intake,  cooling 
tower  evaporation  water  discharge,  and  radioactive  releases  may  change  from  nominal 
conditions.  The  primary  plant  cooling  shifts  from  the  CWS  to  the  essential  SWS  (ESWS)  during 
these  alternate  modes. 

3.4.2  Plant-Environmental  Interfaces  During  Operation 

When  in  operation,  the  new  plant  would  produce  electrical  energy  from  nuclear  fuel  using  a 
steam  turbine  system  as  described  in  Section  3.2.1.  Waste  heat  is  a  by-product  of  normal 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


power  generation  at  a  nuclear  power  plant.  The  excess  heat  that  remains  in  the  closed-loop 
steam  system  after  it  passes  through  the  turbines  would  be  transferred  to  the  atmosphere 
through  evaporation  using  cooling  towers,  as  described  in  Section  3. 2. 2. 2.  Water  for  the  new 
cooling  towers  would  be  obtained  from  a  new  intake  structure  to  be  built  on  the  Delaware  River, 
as  described  in  Section  3. 2. 2. 2.  The  following  sections  describe  the  proposed  plant- 
environmental  interfaces  during  operation  in  terms  of  its  CWS  (Section  3.4.2. 1),  landscape  and 
drainage  (Section  3. 4. 2. 2),  ESWS  or  UHS  (Section  3. 4. 2. 3),  and  emergency  diesel  generators 
(Section  3. 4. 2. 4). 

3. 4. 2. 7  Circulating  Water  System 

As  discussed  in  Sections  3.2.1  and  3.2.2,  a  new  makeup  water  intake  structure  would  be 
located  west  of  the  plant  on  the  Delaware  River  shoreline  about  2,800  ft  north  of  the  HCGS 
service  water  intake  structure  (Figure  2-2).  The  intake  structure  bay  and  screens  would  be 
sized  such  that  the  average  intake  through-screen  velocity  would  be  less  than  0.5  fps  to  meet 
the  requirements  of  the  Clean  Water  Act  Section  31 6(b)  Phase  I  rule  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  - 
TN662). 

The  plant  discharge  would  consist  of  CWS  and  SWS  blowdowns,  SWS  makeup  filter  backwash, 
and  other  wastewater  streams,  including  those  from  PSWSs,  demineralized  water  systems, 
miscellaneous  drains  blowdowns,  and  liquid  radwaste  flow  (Sections  3.2.1  and  3.2.2).  The 
combined  plant  discharge  would  average  51 ,946  gpm  with  a  maximum  of  53,222  gpm.  An 
NJPDES  permit  for  the  plant  would  specify  volumes  and  constituent  concentrations  of  the  plant 
discharge. 

The  plant  would  use  one  or  two  wet  cooling  towers  to  dissipate  waste  heat  (Sections  3.2.1  and 
3.2.2).  The  CWS  cooling  towers  would  use  mechanical  draft,  natural  draft,  or  fan-assisted 
natural  draft  design,  and  the  SWS  cooling  towers  would  be  a  mechanical  draft  design. 

3. 4. 2. 2  Landscape  and  Drainage 

At  the  ESP  stage,  PSEG  has  not  selected  a  single  reactor  design  that  would  be  used  for  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant.  Therefore,  detailed  site  layout  and  drainage  system  features  are  not 
available.  However,  PSEG  has  provided  a  general  description  of  landscape  and  drainage  in 
Chapter  2,  Section  2.4,  of  the  ESP  SSAR  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283).  The  following  discussion 
summarizes  the  information  provided  in  the  SSAR. 

The  design  basis  flood  elevation  would  be  32.1  ft  NAVD88  (see  Table  2. 4. 5-4  in  PSEG  2015- 
TN4283).  Safety-related  SSCs  for  the  new  plant  would  be  designed  with  flood  protection 
features  to  withstand  the  flood  height  of  the  design  basis  flood  and  its  associated  effects.  The 
site  would  be  graded  such  that  runoff  from  the  site  and  power  block  area  would  be  directed  to  a 
system  of  swales  and  pipes  that  would  discharge  to  the  Delaware  River.  At  this  stage,  PSEG 
has  stated  that  most  of  the  area  of  the  new  plant  would  drain  to  the  north  and  west,  away  from 
existing  facilities  at  SGS  and  HCGS. 

The  new  plant  would  require  a  stormwater  management  system.  However,  the  detailed  design 
of  the  stormwater  system  is  not  yet  complete  because  the  site  layout  is  currently  not  known  in 
the  absence  of  a  selected  reactor  design.  PSEG  would  be  required  to  follow  applicable  Federal, 


NUREG-2168

Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


State,  and  local  stormwater  management  regulations  and  to  implement  best  management 
practices  to  minimize  adverse  effects  on  water  quality. 

3. 4. 2. 3  Essential  Service  Water  System 

As  discussed  in  Sections  3.2.1  and  3.2.2,  and  shown  in  Table  3-1 ,  the  UHS  makeup  water  flow 
rate  during  emergencies  would  be  4,568  gpm. 

3. 4. 2. 4  Emergency  Diesel  Generators 

Diesel  generators  and/or  gas  turbines  would  be  used  during  emergency  conditions  to  provide 
electricity  for  water  pumping  and  support  for  other  emergency  activities.  When  in  use,  these 
diesel  generators  or  gas  turbines  would  emit  criteria  pollutants  (as  defined  under  the  U.S. 
Environmental  Protection  Agency  [EPA]  National  Ambient  Air  Quality  Standards  [EPA  2013- 
TN1975]).  Based  on  the  bounding  assumptions  for  the  PPE  (PSEG  2015-TN4283),  the  PSEG 
Site  would  have  six  backup  generators  (four  emergency  and  two  normal)  and/or  six  gas  turbines 
as  part  of  the  emergency  power  supply  system.  The  anticipated  annual  auxiliary  boiler,  diesel 
generator,  and  gas  turbine  air  emissions,  which  include  nitrogen  oxides,  sulfur  oxides,  carbon 
monoxide,  hydrocarbons  in  the  form  of  volatile  organic  compounds,  and  particulate  matter,  are 
provided  in  Table  3-4.  Modifications  to  the  SGS  and  HCGS  Title  V  Operating  Permit  under  the 
Clean  Air  Act  (42  USC  7401  et  seq.  -TN1 141 ),  addressing  emissions  and  compliance  with  State 
and  Federal  regulations,  would  be  required  for  a  new  plant.

3.4.3  Radioactive  Waste  Management  Systems 

Liquid,  gaseous,  and  solid  radioactive  waste  management  systems  would  be  used  to  collect  and 
treat  the  radioactive  materials  produced  as  by-products  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
at  the  PSEG  Site.  These  systems  would  process  radioactive  liquid,  gaseous,  and  solid  effluents 


November  2015 


3-27 


NUREG-2168 


Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


to  maintain  releases  within  regulatory  limits  and  to  levels  as  low  as  reasonably  achievable 
before  releasing  them  to  the  environment.  Waste  processing  systems  would  be  designed  to 
meet  the  design  objectives  of  10  CFR  Part  50  (TN249),  “Domestic  Licensing  of  Production  and 
Utilization  Facilities,”  Appendix  I  ( Numerical  Guides  for  Design  Objectives  and  Limiting 
Conditions  for  Operation  to  Meet  the  Criterion  "As  Low  as  is  Reasonably  Achievable"  for 
Radiological  Material  in  Light-Water-Cooled  Nuclear  Power  Reactor  Effluents ),  and  10  CFR  Part 
20  (TN283),  “Standards  for  Protection  Against  Radiation.” 

Radioactive  material  in  the  reactor  coolant  would  be  the  primary  source  of  gaseous,  liquid,  and 
solid  radioactive  wastes  in  light  water  reactors.  Radioactive  fission  products  build  up  within  the 
fuel  as  a  consequence  of  the  fission  process.  These  fission  products  would  be  contained  in  the 
sealed  fuel  rods,  but  small  quantities  escape  the  fuel  rods  into  the  reactor  coolant.  Neutron 
activation  of  the  primary  coolant  system  would  also  be  responsible  for  coolant  contamination 
and  for  induced  radioactivity  in  reactor  components. 

PSEG  has  not  identified  specific  radioactive  waste  management  systems  for  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site.  The  PPE  concept  was  used  to  provide  an  upper  bound  on  liquid 
radioactive  effluents,  gaseous  radioactive  effluents,  and  solid  radioactive  waste  releases. 
Adequate  design  information  to  estimate  liquid  and  gaseous  radioactive  effluents  was  available 
for  all  four  reactor  designs  considered  in  establishing  the  PPE  values.  Bounding  effluent 
concentrations  were  determined  based  on  a  composite  of  the  highest  activity  content  of  the 
individual  isotopes  for  a  single  unit  U.S.  EPR,  single  unit  ABWR,  single  unit  US-APWR,  and 
dual  unit  API 000.  Bounding  liquid  effluent  releases  and  gaseous  effluent  releases  are  provided 
in  Table  1.3-8  and  Table  1.3-7,  respectively,  of  the  PSEG  SSAR  (PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

Solid  radioactive  wastes  produced  from  operation  of  a  new  plant  would  be  either  dry  or  wet 
solids.  The  solid  radioactive  waste  management  system  would  receive,  collect,  and  store  solid 
wastes  before  onsite  storage  or  shipment  off  the  site.  PSEG  has  indicated  that  the  storage  of 
low-level  solid  waste  would  be  coordinated  with  the  storage  of  waste  from  the  existing  HCGS 
and  SGS.  The  estimated  bounding  annual  volume  of  radioactive  solid  waste  is  16,721 .5  ft3  per 
year  with  an  estimated  bounding  radioactive  material  activity  of  1.18  *  1 06  Ci  per  year 
(PSEG  2015-TN4283;_Table  1.3-1  for  the  volume  and  Table  1.3-3  for  the  activity). 

3.4.4  Nonradioactive  Waste  Management  Systems 

The  following  sections  provide  descriptions  of  the  nonradioactive  waste  systems  for  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  including  systems  for  chemical,  biocide,  and  sanitary 
waste  streams  and  other  effluents.  Detailed  information  regarding  nonradioactive  waste 
management  and  effluent  control  systems,  process/instrumentation  diagrams,  and  system 
process  flow  diagrams  would  be  provided  during  the  COL  application  phase  following  reactor 
technology  selection.  Bounding  parameters  from  the  PPE,  described  in  the  PSEG  SSAR 
(PSEG  2015-TN4283),  and  site-specific  characteristics  are  used  to  establish  conceptual 
nonradioactive  waste  system  descriptions. 

3. 4. 4. 1  Effluents  Containing  Chemicals  or  Biocides 

This  section  describes  the  nonradioactive  waste  systems  and  the  chemical  and  biocidal 
characteristics  of  the  nonradioactive  waste  streams  collected  by  the  wastewater  treatment

Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


system  before  discharge.  Water  chemistry  for  various  plant  water  uses  would  be  controlled  with 
the  addition  of  biocides,  algaecides,  corrosion  inhibitors,  scale  inhibitors,  and  dehalogenators. 
The  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  use  chemicals  and  biocides  similar  to  those  currently 
used  for  the  existing  operations  at  HCGS  and  SGS,  including  sodium  hypochlorite,  sodium 
silicate,  and  sodium  bisulfite.  The  following  nonradioactive  wastewater  constituents  may  be 
generated  in  the  secondary  systems  associated  with  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site: 

•  sodium  and  sulfate  salts  from  neutralized  sodium  hydroxide  and  sulfuric  acid  used  for 
regeneration  of  resins, 

•  sulfuric  acid  for  calcite  scale  control  in  cooling  water  systems, 

•  phosphate  from  cleaning  liquids, 

•  chloride, 

•  biocides  used  for  defouling  purposes, 

•  residual  oxidants, 

•  boiler  blowdown  chemicals,  and 

•  oil  and  grease  from  plant  floor  drains. 

Table  3-5  provides  the  estimated  concentrations  of  impurities  in  the  blowdown  water  and  other 
plant  flows,  which  contribute  to  cooling  water  and  plant  effluent  discharge  to  the  Delaware  River 
(PSEG  2015-TN4283).  The  chemical  concentrations  within  the  new  plant  effluent  streams 
would  be  controlled  through  engineering  and  operational  controls  to  meet  NJPDES 
requirements  as  well  as  requirements  set  by  Federal,  regional,  or  local  regulatory  agencies  at 
the  time  of  construction  and  operation.

3. 4. 4. 2  Sanitary  System  Effluents 

This  section  briefly  describes  the  anticipated  volumes  generated  during  construction  or 
operation  and  the  method  for  ultimate  disposal  of  treated  wastes. 

The  sewage  treatment  system  that  treats  the  daily  flow  from  the  existing  PSEG  Site  would  be 
upgraded  to  accommodate  a  new  power  plant.  Conceptually,  the  new  plant  could  include  two 
units,  each  with  a  capacity  of  70,000  gpd,  and  be  equipped  with  an  extended  aeration  activated 
sludge  system.  Each  unit  would  include  an  aeration  tank  and  clarifier  followed  by  a  chlorine 
contact  chamber.  A  single  surge  tank  would  be  provided  to  equalize  variations  in  influent  flows 
to  the  treatment  units.  A  sludge  holding  tank  would  be  provided  for  waste  sludge.  Residuals 
would  be  disposed  of  off  the  site  in  a  manner  similar  to  current  practices  at  the  existing  PSEG 
plants. 

PSEG  reports  the  bounding  influent  flow  to  the  sanitary  treatment  system  for  operating  the  new 
plant  on  average  would  be  93  gpm,  which  equates  to  an  average  daily  flow  rate  of  134,000  gpd. 
The  bounding  influent  flow  during  construction  is  123,000  gpd  (85  gpm  average)  based  on  the 
peak  construction  workforce  of  4,100  persons  (PSEG  2015-TN4283)  and  a  flow  of  30  gal  per 
capita  per  day  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

New  plant  effluent  discharges  would  be  regulated  under  the  provisions  of  the  Clean  Water  Act 
(33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662),  and  the  conditions  of  discharge,  including  total  suspended 
solids  and  5-day  biochemical  oxygen  demand,  would  be  specified  in  the  NJPDES  permit.  The 
estimated  operational  normal  and  maximum  effluent  flow  rate  from  the  sanitary  waste  water 
system  is  93  gpm  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

3. 4. 4. 3  Other  Nonradioactive  Waste  Effluents 
Gaseous  Emissions 

Nonradioactive  gaseous  and  particulate  emissions  would  result  from  the  cooling  towers,  the 
seasonal  and  intermittent  operation  of  the  auxiliary  boilers,  and  the  intermittent  testing  and 
operation  of  the  standby  power  system  generators.  The  primary  sources  of  emissions  would  be 
the  auxiliary  boilers,  standby  power  units  (e.g.,  diesel  generators,  gas  turbines,  and  engine- 
driven  emergency  equipment.  The  auxiliary  boilers  would  be  used  for  heating  the  new  plant 
buildings,  primarily  during  the  winter  months,  and  for  process  steam  during  plant  startups.  The 
standby  diesel  generators,  standby  gas  turbine  generators,  and  engine-driven  emergency 
equipment  would  be  used  intermittently  and  for  brief  durations.  Low  sulfur  fuels  would  be  used 
for  all  equipment,  thereby  minimizing  gaseous  and  particulate  emissions  during  the  periods 
when  the  equipment  operated.  The  cooling  towers  would  be  the  primary  source  of  particulate 
emissions.  These  emissions  commonly  include  particulates,  sulfur  oxides,  carbon  monoxide, 
hydrocarbons,  and  nitrogen  oxides  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  auxiliary  boilers’  exhaust  would  be  at  an  elevation  of  150  ft  above  grade,  the  standby  diesel 
generators’  exhaust  would  be  at  an  elevation  of  50  ft  above  grade,  and  the  gas  turbines’ 
exhaust  would  be  at  an  elevation  of  50  ft  above  grade.  Table  3-4  in  Section  3. 4. 2. 4  summarizes 
pollutant  emissions  from  the  cooling  towers,  auxiliary  boilers,  diesel  generators,  and  gas  turbine 


NUREG-2168

Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


generators.  PSEG  states  that  gaseous  and  particulate  releases  will  comply  with  Federal,  State, 
and  local  emissions  standards. 

PSEG  states  that  the  site  is  within  an  ozone  nonattainment  area  (Salem  County,  New  Jersey) 
and  adjacent  to  a  nonattainment  area  for  particulate  matter  smaller  than  2.5  pm  in  diameter 
(PM2.5)  (New  Castle  County,  Delaware).  However,  recently  New  Castle  County  was 
redesignated  from  nonattainment  area  to  maintenance  area  for  PM2.5.  The  new  plant  would 
comply  with  all  regulatory  requirements  of  the  Clean  Air  Act  (42  USC  7401  et  seq.  -TN1 141 ), 
including  requirements  of  the  NJDEP  Division  of  Air  Quality,  thereby  minimizing  any  impacts  on 
state  and  regional  air  quality.  Modifications  to  the  SGS  and  HCGS  Air  Operating  Permit  under 
Title  V  of  the  Clean  Air  Act  (42  USC  7401  et  seq.  -TN1 141 )  from  the  NJDEP  would  be  required 
for  the  plant  to  address  emissions  and  compliance  with  State  and  Federal  regulations. 

Small  amounts  of  volatile  organic  compounds  would  also  be  generated  from  the  use  of  common 
building  maintenance  materials  such  as  paints,  adhesives,  and  caulk;  from  mechanical 
maintenance  materials  such  as  oils  and  solvents;  and  periodically  from  activities  such  as 
asphalt  resealing. 

Liquid  Effluents 

Nonradioactive  liquid  effluents  that  potentially  drain  to  the  Delaware  River  would  be  limited 
under  the  NJPDES  permit.  These  liquid  effluents  would  primarily  be  discharges  from  site  storm 
drainage  outfalls  and  plant  drains  and  other  power  block  discharges  such  as  CWS  and  SWS 
blowdown  and  the  sanitary  water  system.  Existing  site  storm  drainage  outfalls  may  be  modified, 
and  new  outfalls  to  the  Delaware  River  may  be  constructed  to  accommodate  adjusted  flow 
paths  or  volumes  created  by  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Liquid  effluents  from  the  power  block  of  the  new  plant  would  be 
combined  with  the  cooling  tower  blowdown  and  sanitary  system  effluent,  treated  in  the 
wastewater  treatment  facility,  and  routed  to  the  common  plant  outfall  that  discharges  to  the 
Delaware  River.  Table  3-5  provides  a  summary  of  the  combined  discharge  from  the  five 
primary  flows.  The  design  of  the  stormwater  systems  for  a  new  plant  would  comply  with 
relevant  Federal,  State,  and  local  stormwater  regulations.  The  total  residual  chemical 
concentrations  in  the  discharges  to  the  Delaware  River  watershed  are  subject  to  limits 
established  by  the  NJDEP,  which  are  deemed  protective  of  the  water  quality  of  the  Delaware 
River  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Solid  Effluents 

Nonradioactive  solid  wastes  would  include  typical  industrial  wastes  such  as  metal,  wood,  and 
paper  and  process  wastes  such  as  nonradioactive  resins  and  sludge.  PSEG  is  currently  a 
conditionally  exempt  small-quantity  hazardous  waste  generator,  generating  less  than  100  kg  per 
month  (220  Ib/mo).  PSEG  maintains  the  programs  required  of  a  small-quantity  generator  and 
monitors  the  amount  of  hazardous  waste  generated  each  month.  Hazardous  waste  is  disposed 
of  through  licensed  disposal  facilities.  Universal  waste,  such  as  paint  waste,  lead-acid  batteries, 
used  lamps,  and  mercury-containing  switches,  is  segregated  and  disposed  of  off  the  site 
through  licensed  disposal  facilities.

NUREG-2168 


Site  Layout  and  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 


Normal  station  waste  (e.g.,  paper,  plastic,  glass,  and  river  vegetation)  is  segregated  and,  as 
much  as  possible,  processed  for  recycling.  Currently,  about  two-thirds  of  the  normal  station 
waste  is  transferred  to  recycling  vendors  and  the  remainder  either  incinerated  or  placed  in  a 
landfill  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Normal  station  waste  generated  by  a  new  plant  would  be 
accommodated  by  existing  practices  at  the  SGS  and  HCGS  sites.

Mixed  waste  is  a  combination  of  hazardous  waste  and  low-level  radioactive  material,  special 
nuclear  material,  or  by-product  materials.  Mixed  waste  could  be  created  during  activities  such 
as  routine  maintenance,  refueling,  and  radiochemical  laboratory  work.  The  NRC  (10  CFR)  and 
EPA  (40  CFR)  regulations  govern  generation,  management,  handling,  storage,  treatment, 
disposal,  and  protection  requirements  associated  with  these  wastes.  Management  of  these 
wastes  would  conform  to  applicable  Federal  and  State  requirements  in  a  manner  similar  to  that 
for  existing  PSEG  operations.  The  quantities  expected  from  a  new  plant  would  be  small 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).

4.0  CONSTRUCTION  IMPACTS  AT  THE  PROPOSED  SITE 


This  chapter  examines  the  environmental  issues  associated  with  building  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG)  Site  as  described  in  the 
application  for  an  early  site  permit  (ESP)  submitted  by  PSEG  to  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory 
Commission  (NRC).  Although  an  ESP  would  not  provide  NRC  authorization  to  conduct 
construction  activities,  as  part  of  its  application,  PSEG  submitted  (1)  an  Environmental  Report 
(ER)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  which  discusses  the  environmental  impacts  of  building,  operating, 
and  decommissioning  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  and  (2)  a  Site  Safety  Analysis  Report  (SSAR) 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4283),  which  addresses  safety  aspects  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant.  PSEG  also  submitted  a  Federal  and  State  Application  for  the  Alteration  of  Any 
Floodplain,  Waterway,  or  Tidal  or  Nontidal  Wetland  in  New  Jersey  to  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of 
Engineers  (USACE)  and  to  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP) 
(USACE  2014-TN4235). 

As  discussed  in  Section  3.3  of  this  environmental  impact  statement  (E IS),  the  NRC  authority 
related  to  building  new  nuclear  units  is  limited  to  construction  “activities  that  have  a  reasonable 
nexus  to  radiological  health  and  safety  and/or  common  defense  and  security”  (72  FR  57416- 
TN260).  The  NRC  has  defined  “construction”  within  the  context  of  its  regulatory  authority. 

Many  of  the  activities  required  to  build  a  nuclear  power  plant  do  not  fall  within  the  NRC 
regulatory  authority  and,  therefore,  are  not  “construction”  as  defined  by  the  NRC.  Such 
activities  are  referred  to  as  “preconstruction”  activities  in  Title  10  of  the  Code  of  Federal 
Regulations  (CFR)  51.45(c)  (TN250).  The  NRC  staff  evaluates  the  direct,  indirect,  and 
cumulative  impacts  of  the  construction  activities  that  would  be  authorized  if  the  holder  of  an  ESP 
applied  for  and  was  issued  a  combined  construction  permit  (CP)  and  operating  license  (i.e. , 
combined  license  [COL])  for  the  site.  The  environmental  effects  of  preconstruction  activities 
(e.g.,  clearing  and  grading,  excavation,  and  erection  of  support  buildings)  are  included  as  part  of 
this  EIS  in  the  evaluation  of  cumulative  impacts. 

As  described  in  Section  1.1.6,  the  USACE  is  a  cooperating  agency  on  this  EIS  consistent  with 
the  updated  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  signed  with  the  NRC  (USACE  and 
NRC  2008-TN637).  The  NRC  and  USACE  established  this  cooperative  agreement  because 
both  agencies  concluded  it  is  the  most  effective  and  efficient  use  of  Federal  resources  in  the 
environmental  review  of  a  proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant.  The  goal  of  this  cooperative 
agreement  is  the  development  of  one  EIS  that  provides  all  the  environmental  information  and 
analyses  needed  by  the  NRC  to  make  a  license/permit  decision  and  all  the  information  needed 
by  the  USACE  to  perform  analyses,  draw  conclusions,  and  make  a  permit  decision  in  the 
USACE  Record  of  Decision  documentation.  To  accomplish  this  goal,  the  environmental  review 
described  in  this  EIS  was  conducted  by  a  joint  NRC-USACE  team.  The  review  team  was 
composed  of  the  NRC  staff  and  its  contractors  and  staff  from  the  USACE. 

The  USACE  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  information  presented  in  this  EIS  is  adequate  to 
fulfill  the  requirements  of  the  USACE  regulations;  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency’s 
(EPA’s)  404(b)(1)  “Guidelines  for  Specification  of  Disposal  Sites  for  Dredged  or  Fill  Material” 

(40  CFR  Part  230-TN427),  hereafter  the  404(b)(1)  Guidelines,  which  contains  the  substantive 
environmental  criteria  used  by  the  USACE  in  evaluating  discharges  of  dredged  or  fill  material

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


into  waters  of  the  United  States;  and  the  USACE  public  interest  review  process.  The  USACE 
will  decide  whether  to  issue  a  permit  based  on  an  evaluation  of  the  probable  impact  including 
cumulative  impacts  of  the  proposed  activity  on  the  public  interest.  By  guidelines,  no  discharge 
of  dredged  or  fill  material  shall  be  permitted  if  there  is  a  practicable  alternative  to  the  proposed 
discharge  that  would  have  less  adverse  impact  on  the  aquatic  ecosystem  provided  the 
alternative  does  not  have  other  significant  adverse  consequences.  That  USACE  decision  will 
reflect  the  national  concern  for  both  protection  and  use  of  important  resources.  The  benefit 
which  reasonably  may  be  expected  to  accrue  from  the  proposal  must  be  balanced  against  its 
reasonably  foreseeable  detriments.  Factors  that  may  be  relevant  to  the  proposal  will  be 
considered  including  the  cumulative  effects  thereof;  among  those  are  conservation,  economics, 
aesthetics,  general  environmental  concerns,  wetlands,  historic  and  cultural  resources,  fish 
and  wildlife  values,  flood  hazards,  floodplain  values,  land  use,  navigation,  shore  erosion  and 
accretion,  recreation,  water  supply,  water  quality,  energy  needs,  safety,  food  and  fiber 
production,  mineral  needs,  considerations  of  property  ownership,  and,  in  general,  the  needs 
and  welfare  of  the  people. 

Many  of  the  impacts  the  USACE  must  address  in  its  analysis  are  the  result  of  preconstruction 
activities.  Also,  most  of  the  activities  conducted  by  a  COL  applicant  that  would  require  a  permit 
from  the  USACE  would  be  preconstruction  activities.  PSEG  plans  to  submit  an  application  to 
the  USACE  for  a  permit  to  conduct  the  following  activities:  filling,  dredging,  grading,  and 
building  structures. 

While  both  the  NRC  and  the  USACE  must  meet  the  requirements  of  the  National  Environmental 
Policy  Act  of  1969,  as  amended  (NEPA)  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661),  both  agencies  also 
have  mission  requirements  that  must  be  met  in  addition  to  the  NEPA  requirements.  The  NRC 
regulatory  authority  is  based  on  the  Atomic  Energy  Act  of  1954,  as  amended  (42  USC  201 1 
et  seq.  -TN663).  The  USACE  regulatory  authority  related  to  the  proposed  action  is  based  on 
Section  10  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors  Appropriations  Act  of  1899  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  -TN660), 
which  prohibits  the  obstruction  or  alteration  of  navigable  waters  of  the  United  States  without  a 
permit  from  the  USACE,  and  Section  404  of  the  Clean  Water  Act  (CWA,  33  USC  1344  et  seq.  - 
TNI  01 9),  which  prohibits  the  discharge  of  dredged  or  fill  material  into  waters  of  the  United 
States  without  a  permit  from  the  USACE.  Therefore,  the  applicant  may  not  commence 
preconstruction  or  construction  activities  in  jurisdictional  waters,  including  wetlands,  without  a 
USACE  permit.  The  USACE  will  complete  its  evaluation  of  the  proposed  project  after  it  fully 
considers  the  recommendations  of  the  USACE  staff;  Federal,  State,  and  local  resource 
agencies;  and  members  of  the  public  and  assesses  the  cumulative  impact  of  the  total  project 
and  after  the  following  consultations  and  coordination  efforts  are  completed:  Section  106  of  the 
National  Historic  Preservation  Act  (54  USC  300101  et  seq.  -TN4157),  including,  as  appropriate, 
development  and  implementation  of  any  Memoranda  of  Agreement;  the  Endangered  Species 
Act  of  1973  (16  USC  1531  et  seq.  -TNI 010);  Essential  Fish  Habitat  Assessment  (NOAA  1999- 
TN1845);  State  forest  conservation  plans;  State  water-quality  certifications;  and  State  coastal 
zone  consistency  determinations.  Because  the  USACE  is  a  cooperating  agency  under  the 
MOU  for  this  EIS,  the  USACE  decision  of  whether  to  issue  a  permit  will  not  be  made  until  after 
the  NRC-USACE  final  EIS  is  issued. 

The  collaborative  effort  between  the  NRC  and  the  USACE  in  presenting  the  discussion  of  the 
environmental  effects  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  in  this  chapter  and  elsewhere, 


NUREG-2168 


4-2 


November  2015 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


must  serve  the  needs  of  both  agencies.  Consistent  with  the  MOU,  the  NRC  and  USACE  staffs 
collaborated  in  the  (1)  review  of  the  ESP  application  and  information  provided  in  response  to 
requests  for  additional  information  (developed  by  the  NRC  and  the  USACE)  and 
(2)  development  of  the  EIS.  The  NRC  regulations  (10  CFR  51 .45(c)  [TN250])  require  that  the 
impacts  of  preconstruction  activities  be  addressed  by  the  applicant  as  cumulative  impacts  in  its 
ER.  Similarly,  the  NRC  analysis  of  the  environmental  effects  of  preconstruction  activities  on 
each  resource  area  would  be  addressed  as  cumulative  impacts,  normally  presented  in 
Chapter  7  of  the  EIS.  However,  because  of  the  collaborative  effort  between  the  NRC  and  the 
USACE  in  the  environmental  review,  the  combined  impacts  of  construction  activities  that  would 
be  authorized  by  the  NRC  with  the  eventual  issuance  of  a  COL  and  preconstruction  activities 
are  presented  in  this  chapter.  For  each  resource  area,  the  NRC  also  provides  an  impact 
characterization  solely  for  construction  activities  that  meet  the  NRC  definition  of  construction  at 
10  CFR  50.10(a)  (TN249).  The  combined  impacts  of  construction  and  preconstruction  activities 
are  considered  in  the  description  and  assessment  of  cumulative  impacts  in  Chapter  7  of  this 
EIS. 

For  most  environmental  resource  areas  (e.g.,  terrestrial  ecology),  the  impacts  are  not  solely  the 
result  of  either  preconstruction  or  construction  activities.  Rather,  the  impacts  are  attributable  to 
a  combination  of  preconstruction  and  construction  activities.  For  most  resource  areas,  the 
majority  of  the  impacts  would  occur  as  a  result  of  preconstruction  activities. 

This  chapter  is  divided  into  12  sections.  In  Sections  4.1  through  4.1 1 ,  the  review  team 
evaluates  the  potential  impacts  on  land  use,  water  use  and  quality,  terrestrial  and  aquatic 
ecosystems,  socioeconomics,  environmental  justice,  historic  and  cultural  resources, 
meteorology  and  air  quality,  nonradiological  health  effects,  radiological  health  effects, 
nonradioactive  waste,  and  applicable  measures  and  controls  that  would  limit  the  adverse 
impacts  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  An  impact  category  level — SMALL, 
MODERATE,  or  LARGE — of  potential  adverse  impacts  has  been  assigned  by  the  review  team 
for  each  resource  area  using  the  definitions  for  these  terms  established  in  Chapter  1 .  In  some 
resource  areas,  for  example,  in  the  socioeconomic  area  where  the  impacts  of  taxes  are 
analyzed,  the  impacts  may  be  considered  beneficial  and  would  be  stated  as  such.  The  review 
team  determination  of  the  impact  category  levels  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  mitigation 
measures  identified  in  the  ER  or  activities  planned  by  various  State  and  county  governments, 
such  as  infrastructure  upgrades  (discussed  throughout  this  chapter),  are  implemented.  Failure 
to  implement  these  upgrades  might  result  in  a  change  in  the  impact  category  level.  Possible 
mitigation  of  adverse  impacts,  where  appropriate,  is  presented  in  Section  4.11.  A  summary  of 
the  construction  impacts  is  presented  in  Section  4.12.  The  technical  analyses  provided  in  this 
chapter  support  the  results,  conclusions,  and  recommendations  presented  in  Chapters  7,  9, 
and  10. 

The  review  team  evaluation  of  the  impacts  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  draws  on  information  presented  in  the  PSEG  ER  and  SSAR  (PSEG  2015-TN4280  and 
PSEG  2015-TN4283,  respectively)  and  supplemental  documents,  the  USACE  permitting 
documentation,  and  other  government  and  independent  sources.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


4.1  Land-Use  Impacts 

This  section  provides  information  about  land-use  impacts  associated  with  site  preparation 
activities  (preconstruction)  and  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  breakdown  of  activities  into  preconstruction  and  construction  categories  is  provided  in 
Section  3.3  and  discussed  in  Section  4.1.1.  Topics  discussed  in  this  section  include  land-use 
impacts  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site  (Section  4.1.1)  and  at  offsite  areas, 
especially  the  proposed  causeway  alignment  (Section  4.1.2). 

4.1.1  The  Site  and  Vicinity 

The  following  characterizations  of  impacts  are  based  on  the  NJDEP  land  use  and  land  cover 
(LULC)  classification  system.  As  discussed  in  Section  2.2.1,  the  PSEG  Site  includes  819  ac,  of 
which  PSEG  owns  734  ac  as  the  existing  PSEG  property.  For  a  new  nuclear  power  plant, 
PSEG  would  acquire  from  the  USACE  an  additional  85  ac  north  of  Hope  Creek  Generating 
Station  (HCGS)  (Figure  2-2).  During  construction,  PSEG  would  temporarily  lease  from  the 
USACE  an  additional  45  ac  north  of  the  PSEG  Site  as  the  location  of  the  concrete  batch  plant 
and  a  construction/laydown  area  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Land-use  impacts  associated  with  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  would 
result  from  land  disturbance  and  changes  in  land  use  during  both  preconstruction  and 
construction  activities.  Preconstruction  activities  would  include  site  clearing  and  grading, 
implementing  erosion  control  and  other  environmental  mitigation  measures,  erecting  fences, 
excavation,  erecting  support  buildings,  and  building  onsite  roads  and  transmission  lines. 
Construction  activities  for  safety-related  structures,  systems,  or  components  would  include 
driving  piles;  subsurface  preparation;  placing  backfill,  concrete,  or  permanent  retaining  walls 
within  an  excavation;  installing  foundations;  or  assembling,  erecting,  fabricating,  or  testing  those 
structures  in  place. 

As  described  by  PSEG,  these  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  would  disturb  up  to 
430  ac  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  in  the  immediate  vicinity  (excluding  the  proposed  causeway).  Of 
this  total,  225  ac  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  permanently  disturbed  to  support  developed  or 
industrial  land  uses  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  (including  70  ac  for  the  power 
block),  and  205  ac  would  be  temporarily  disturbed  for  laydown  and  construction  areas  (160  ac 
on  the  PSEG  Site  and  45  ac  off  the  site)  (Table  4-1 )  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

The  225  ac  that  would  be  permanently  disturbed  to  support  urban  or  built-up  land  uses  includes 
108  ac  of  wetland  (primarily  Phragmites-  [common  reed-]  dominated  coastal  and  interior 
wetlands),  47  ac  of  urban  or  built-up  land  associated  with  HCGS  and  Salem  Generating  Station 
(SGS),  43  ac  of  water  (artificial  lakes  and  tidal  waters),  19  ac  of  barren  land,  and  9  ac  of 
forestland  (Table  4-1  and  Figure  4-1).  More  than  one-third  of  the  area  that  would  be 
permanently  disturbed  (85  ac  of  the  total  225  ac)  is  currently  part  of  the  USACE  Artificial  Island 
Confined  Disposal  Facility  (CDF).  The  urban  or  built-up  lands  on  the  PSEG  Site  that  would  be 
permanently  disturbed  have  been  or  are  being  used  for  construction  and  operation  of  HCGS 
and  SGS  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

of  old  field  and  Phragmites-tioir\'\r\a\.e6  old  field;  32  ac  of  wetlands  (primarily  Phragmites- 
dominated  interior  wetlands);  45  ac  of  urban  or  built-up  land;  and  3  ac  of  water,  barren  land,  and 
managed  wetlands.  Most  of  the  old  field  and  wetlands  that  would  be  temporarily  disturbed  are 
currently  part  of  the  Artificial  Island  CDF.  The  urban  or  built-up  lands  on  the  PSEG  Site  that 
would  be  temporarily  disturbed  have  been  or  are  being  used  for  construction  and  operation  of 
HCGS  and  SGS  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

The  45-ac  offsite  parcel  that  would  be  temporarily  disturbed  is  part  of  the  Artificial  Island  CDF 
and  includes  30  ac  of  wetlands  (primarily  Phragmites- dominated  interior  wetlands),  13  ac  of 
barren  land,  and  2  ac  of  urban  or  built-up  land  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

PSEG  stated  that  fill  material  would  be  needed  to  elevate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and 
associated  structures  to  final  grade  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  During  the 
Environmental  Site  Audit,  PSEG  stated  that  as  much  as  7.5  million  yd3  of  fill  material  could  be 
needed  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  that,  to  the  extent  possible,  this  material  would  come  from  the 
existing  PSEG  property.  If  additional  fill  material  were  needed  from  off  the  site,  PSEG  stated 
that  it  would  come  from  existing  permitted  borrow  areas  and  identified  numerous  potential 
borrow  sites  in  New  Jersey,  Delaware,  and  Maryland  (PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

Of  the  819-ac  PSEG  Site,  both  the  734-ac  parcel  owned  by  PSEG  and  the  85-ac  parcel  to  be 
acquired  by  PSEG  are  zoned  for  “Industrial  Use”  by  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township 
(LACT  1999-TN2416).  Thus,  building  a  new  nuclear  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  be 
consistent  with  existing  land  uses  at  HCGS  and  SGS  and  with  current  land-use  zoning. 

As  discussed  in  Section  2.2.1,  the  NJDEP  Division  of  Land  Use  Regulation  has  determined  that 
the  PSEG  ESP  application  is  consistent  with  State  of  New  Jersey  Rules  on  Coastal  Zone 
Management  as  amended  to  January  20,  2009,  with  one  condition: 

As  proposed,  the  project  will  require  a  CAFRA  [Coastal  Areas  Facilities  Review 
Act  (NJSA  13:19  et  seq.  -TN4304)]  Individual  Permit,  Coastal  Wetlands  Permit, 
Waterfront  Development  Permit,  and  Freshwater  Wetlands  Individual  Permit  from 
the  Division.  These  permits  must  be  obtained  prior  to  any  construction  activities 
on  the  site  related  to  the  project  described  above  (NJDEP  2010-TN235). 

The  New  Jersey  State  Planning  Commission  State  Plan  Policy  Map  delineates  a  "Heavy 
Industry-Transportation-Utility  Node" on  Artificial  Island,  including  501  ac  of  the  existing  734-ac 
PSEG  property  (see  Section  2.2.1).  PSEG  has  submitted  a  petition  to  expand  this  existing  node 
from  501  ac  to  534  ac  (to  include  the  location  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant)  and  to  add  288  ac 
of  the  USACE  Artificial  Island  CDF.  The  PSEG  petition  is  currently  under  review  by  the  State 
(PSEG  2012-TN2282).  If  approved,  this  node  expansion  would  facilitate  the  development  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site. 

There  are  no  prime  farmlands  or  farmlands  of  unique  or  statewide  importance  on  the  PSEG  Site 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280),  and  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  site  would  not  affect  any 
such  farmlands  in  the  vicinity.  Likewise,  there  are  no  lands  under  Deeds  of  Conservation 
Restriction  (DCRs)  or  Wildlife  Management  Areas  (WMAs)  on  the  PSEG  Site,  and  building  a

new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  site  would  not  affect  any  of  the  lands  under  DCRs  or  lands  in 
WMAs  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site  (PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

Overall,  the  land-use  impacts  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  be 
sufficient  to  alter  noticeably,  but  not  to  destabilize,  important  attributes  of  existing  land  uses  on 
the  site.  Much  of  the  land  disturbance  (205  ac  of  a  total  of  430  ac)  would  be  temporary,  and  the 
land  would  return  to  its  existing  use  once  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  were 
completed.  However,  most  of  the  permanent  land  disturbance  (143  ac  of  a  total  of  225  ac) 
would  occur  on  Phragmites- dominated  wetlands  and  artificial  lakes,  and  much  of  this  area 
(85  ac)  is  in  the  parcel  that  PSEG  would  acquire  from  the  USACE.  Land-use  impacts  on  this 
85-ac  parcel  would  be  somewhat  larger  than  those  on  the  existing  PSEG  property  because  it 
supports  the  USACE  dredging  operations  as  part  of  the  Artificial  Island  CDF.  The  Artificial 
Island  CDF  provides  the  USACE  with  dredge  spoil  disposal  capacity  adjacent  to  the  Delaware 
River,  and  the  USACE  would  need  to  replace  some  or  all  of  this  disposal  capacity  by  using  an 
existing  CDF  or  developing  a  new  CDF  at  another  location.  Combined,  the  change  in  land  use 
of  143  ac  from  Phragmites- dominated  wetlands  and  artificial  lakes  to  developed  and  industrial 
uses  and  the  USACE  loss  of  dredge  spoil  disposal  capacity  at  the  Artificial  Island  CDF  would 
alter  noticeably,  but  not  destabilize,  existing  land  uses  on  the  PSEG  Site. 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team  independent  review,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  combined  land-use  impacts  of  preconstruction  and  construction 
activities  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  MODERATE,  primarily  because  of  the  USACE  loss  of 
dredge  spoil  disposal  capacity  at  the  Artificial  Island  CDF.  Based  on  this  analysis,  and  because 
the  NRC-authorized  construction  activities  (i.e. ,  power  block  construction)  would  occur  on  the 
85-ac  parcel  that  PSEG  would  acquire  from  the  USACE,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the 
land-use  impacts  of  the  NRC-authorized  construction  would  also  be  MODERATE. 

4.1.2  Offsite  Areas 

As  discussed  in  Section  2. 2. 2. 3,  PSEG  proposes  to  build  a  three-lane  elevated  causeway  from 
the  northeast  corner  of  the  PSEG  property  along  or  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek-Red 
Lion  transmission  corridor  to  the  intersection  of  Money  Island  Road  and  Mason  Point  Road 
(Figure  2-7).  Portions  of  the  causeway  could  affect  jurisdictional  wetlands  and  would  be 
subject  to  USACE  review  and  permit  approval.  The  causeway  would  be  about  5.0  mi  long,  have 
200-ft-wide  rights-of-way  (ROWs)  in  upland  areas  at  the  northern  and  southern  termini,  and 
have  a  48-ft-wide  structure  for  the  elevated  portions  within  lowland  areas  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Land-use  impacts  associated  with  building  the  proposed  causeway  would  result  from  land 
disturbance  and  changes  in  land  use  due  to  preconstruction  activities.  Preconstruction  activities 
would  be  associated  with  road  building  at  each  end  of  the  causeway  and  with  building  the  piers 
on  which  the  elevated  causeway  would  be  installed.  Permanent  impacts  would  result  from  the 
placement  of  structures  (piers,  pilings,  or  other  support  structures)  and  shading  from  the 
50-ft-wide  causeway.  Temporary  impacts  would  result  from  the  temporary  placement  of  work 
mats  to  support  equipment,  materials,  and  personnel. 

As  described  by  PSEG,  these  preconstruction  activities  would  disturb  up  to  69.0  ac  along  the 
proposed  causeway  corridor.  Of  this  total,  45.5  ac  would  be  permanently  disturbed  to  support

developed  land  uses  associated  with  the  causeway,  and  23.5  ac  would  be  temporarily  disturbed 
for  laydown  and  construction  areas  (Table  4-2).  These  areas  of  disturbance  are  based  on  a 
50-ft-wide  permanent  ROW  and  an  additional  50-ft-wide  area  along  the  elevated  portion  to  be 
temporarily  affected  during  causeway  construction  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

The  45.5  ac  that  would  be  permanently  disturbed  for  the  causeway  includes  23  ac  of  wetlands 
(primarily  Phragmites-dominaied  coastal  wetlands),  12.4  ac  of  agricultural  land  (cropland  and 
pastureland),  3.5  ac  of  forestland,  2.4  ac  of  water,  and  4.2  ac  of  urban  or  built-up  land 
(associated  with  HCGS  and  SGS  and  lands  along  Money  Island  Road)  (Table  4-2).  The 
wetlands  that  would  be  permanently  disturbed  are  located  in  areas  that  are  part  of  the  PSEG 
Estuary  Enhancement  Program  (EEP),  the  Abbott’s  Meadow  WMA,  and  the  Mad  Horse  Creek

WMA.  The  agricultural  land  that  would  be  affected  is  no  longer  available  for  farming  because  it 
is  too  wet  for  agriculture  (e.g.,  coastal  marsh  areas  that  were  prime  farmland  when  historically 
drained  and  used  for  salt  hay  production).  The  developed  lands  that  would  be  affected  include 
1 .0  ac  of  residential  land  on  Money  Island  Road  (owned  by  PSEG  with  a  structure  used  as  a 
PSEG  environmental  project  office)  and  1 .0  ac  of  recreational  land  (composed  of  several  small 
areas  located  within  the  Abbott’s  Meadow  WMA  and  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA)  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

The  23.5  ac  that  would  be  temporarily  disturbed  for  the  causeway  includes  1 9.6  ac  of  wetland 
(primarily  Phragmites-6orr\'\naie6  coastal  wetlands  and  freshwater  tidal  marshes)  and  2.2  ac  of 
tidal  waters.  The  wetlands  that  would  be  temporarily  disturbed  are  located  in  areas  that  are  part 
of  the  PSEG  EEP,  the  Abbott’s  Meadow  WMA,  and  the  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

The  land  area  that  would  be  disturbed  for  the  proposed  causeway  from  the  PSEG  property 
north  to  Lower  Alloways  Creek  is  zoned  for  Industrial  Use  by  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township 
(LACT  1999-TN2416).  However,  the  land  area  that  would  be  disturbed  from  Lower  Alloways 
Creek  north  to  Money  Island  Road  is  zoned  for  Conservation  by  Elsinboro  Township,  while  the 
land  area  that  would  be  disturbed  along  Money  Island  Road  is  zoned  Rural  Residential 
(Elsinboro  2007-TN2417).  Thus,  building  the  causeway  would  be  consistent  with  current  zoning 
in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township  but  inconsistent  with  part  of  the  current  zoning  (i.e. , 
Conservation)  in  Elsinboro  Township.  PSEG  could  request  a  zoning  variance  from  Elsinboro 
Township  to  build  the  proposed  causeway  in  the  area  zoned  for  Conservation  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

As  discussed  in  Sections  2.2.1  and  4.1.1,  the  NJDEP  Division  of  Land  Use  Regulation  has 
determined  that  the  PSEG  ESP  application,  including  the  proposed  causeway,  is  consistent  with 
State  of  New  Jersey  Rules  on  Coastal  Zone  Management  (NJDEP  2010-TN235). 

About  34  ac  of  land  designated  as  prime  and  unique  farmlands  or  farmlands  of  unique 
importance  (based  on  soil  type)  would  be  affected  by  causeway  construction  (PSEG  2012- 
TN2282). 

Most  of  the  proposed  causeway  route  (4.0  mi  or  21 .0  ac  of  impact)  is  protected  under  DCRs 
held  by  the  State  of  New  Jersey  (PSEG  2012-TN2282).  These  DCRs  would  have  to  be 
released  by  the  State  for  the  causeway  to  be  built.  About  2.0  mi  (10.5  ac  of  impact)  of  the 
causeway  route  is  located  within  the  Alloway  Creek  Watershed  Wetland  Restoration  (ACW) 

Site,  which  is  part  of  the  PSEG  EEP  (Figure  2-1 1 )  and  subject  to  a  DCR  held  by  NJDEP.  These 
ACW  Site  lands  are  privately  owned  by  PSEG  and  were  not  purchased  with  funds  from  the 
State  Green  Acres  Program,  so  approval  from  the  NJDEP  commissioner  would  be  required  to 
release  the  DCR.  Before  any  release  of  the  DCR,  the  NJDEP  would  conduct  a  public  hearing 
and  the  NJDEP  commissioner  would  review  recommendations  by  NJDEP  staff  and  consider  the 
public  interest  in  preserving  the  lands  under  the  DCR.  PSEG  anticipates  that  it  would  have  to 
provide  the  State  with  compensatory  lands  for  any  ACW  Site  lands  released  from  the  DCR 
(PSEG  2012-TN2282). 


NUREG-2168

November  2015 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


About  0.4  mi  (0.8  ac  of  impact)  of  the  causeway  route  is  located  within  the  Abbott’s  Meadow 
WMA,  which  is  located  at  the  northern  end  of  Money  Island  Road  (Figure  2-1 1 )  (PSEG  2012- 
TN2282).  The  Abbott’s  Meadow  WMA  is  owned  by  the  State  of  New  Jersey  and  is  subject  to 
the  DCR  release  provisions  of  the  State  Green  Acres  Program,  the  program  used  by  NJDEP  to 
acquire  land  for  State  parks,  forests,  natural  areas,  and  WMAs.  To  release  a  DCR  on  land  that 
is  owned  by  the  State  and/or  purchased  with  Green  Acres  Program  funds,  NJDEP  would  need 
to  apply  to  the  State  House  Commission  for  a  disposal  of  land.  Compensation  for  a  major 
disposal  of  land  is  required  under  the  Green  Acres  Program,  and  all  such  compensation  must 
meet  certain  minimum  requirements.  The  application  for  disposal  must  include  an  appraisal  of 
the  land  to  be  disposed  of  (based  on  the  highest  value  of  the  land)  and  an  appraisal  of  the 
replacement  land  proposed  as  compensation.  For  successful  applications,  the  State  House 
Commission  executes  a  release  of  the  land  to  be  disposed  of  and  executes  with  the  applicant 
an  agreement  releasing  Green  Acres  Program  restrictions  on  the  land  disposed  and  subjecting 
the  replacement  land  to  the  Green  Acres  restrictions,  if  applicable  (PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

For  the  DCR  to  be  released  on  lands  in  the  Abbott’s  Meadow  WMA,  PSEG  has  identified 
compensatory  lands  at  the  Mason’s  Point  Site  in  Elsinboro  Township,  Salem  County,  near 
Alloway  Creek,  2.5  mi  upstream  from  the  creek  confluence  with  the  Delaware  River.  Although 
most  of  the  potential  compensatory  site  is  currently  owned  by  the  State,  PSEG  would  purchase 
additional  contiguous  lands  to  offset  the  loss  of  deed  restricted  and/or  State-owned  land 
associated  with  the  proposed  causeway  (PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

About  1 .6  mi  (9.7  ac  of  impact)  of  the  causeway  route  is  located  within  the  Mad  Horse  Creek 
WMA  (Figure  2-11),  which  is  owned  by  the  State  of  New  Jersey  (PSEG  2012-TN2282).  PSEG 
has  stated  that  there  is  no  readily  available  record  of  the  source  of  funding  for  the  Mad  Horse 
Creek  WMA  and  no  record  of  funding  through  the  New  Jersey  Green  Acres  Program.  PSEG 
has  also  stated  that  the  diversion  of  lands  for  development  of  the  causeway  would  be  subject 
to  essentially  the  same  process  as  lands  that  had  been  purchased  with  Green  Acres  Program 
funding  (PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

Overall,  the  land-use  impacts  of  building  the  proposed  causeway  would  be  sufficient  to  alter 
noticeably,  but  not  destabilize,  important  attributes  of  existing  land  uses.  Some  of  the  land 
disturbance  (23.5  ac  of  a  total  of  69.0  ac)  would  be  temporary,  and  the  land  would  return  to 
its  existing  use  once  the  causeway  was  completed.  However,  most  of  the  land  disturbance 
(45.5  ac  of  a  total  of  69.0  ac)  would  be  permanent  and  would  have  a  noticeable  impact  because 
it  would  occur  on  undeveloped  wetlands  protected  under  DCRs  within  the  ACW  Site,  the 
Abbott’s  Meadow  WMA,  and  the  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA.  Releasing  these  lands  from  the 
existing  DCRs  would  require  NJDEP  to  take  various  procedural  actions  and,  for  the  WMAs, 
would  require  that  PSEG  provide  compensatory  land  elsewhere.  The  change  in  land  use  to 
developed  lands  in  these  protected  areas  would  alter  noticeably,  but  not  destabilize,  existing 
land  uses  along  the  causeway  route. 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  land-use  impacts  of  building  the  proposed  causeway  would  be 
MODERATE,  primarily  because  of  the  permanent  change  in  land  use  within  areas  protected  by 
DCRs.  Because  building  the  proposed  causeway  would  not  be  part  of  the  NRC-authorized 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


construction  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  there  would  be  no  land- 
use  impacts  along  the  causeway  route  due  to  the  NRC-authorized  construction. 

4.2  Water-Related  Impacts 

Water-related  impacts  involved  in  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would 
be  similar  to  impacts  that  would  be  associated  with  any  large  industrial  construction  project  and 
not  much  different  than  those  seen  during  construction  of  the  SGS  and  HCGS. 

Before  initiating  building  activities,  including  any  site  preparation  work,  PSEG  would  be  required 
to  obtain  the  appropriate  authorizations  regulating  alterations  to  the  hydrological  environment. 
These  authorizations  would  likely  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  the  following.  Additional  detail 
regarding  the  items  listed  is  contained  in  Appendix  H. 

•  CWA  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  Section  404  Permit.  This  permit  would  be  issued  by 
the  USACE,  which  governs  discharge  of  dredged  and/or  fill  material  into  waters  of  the 
United  States.  This  permit  requires  both  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  Coastal  Zone 
Management  Program  concurrence. 

•  Section  10  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors  Appropriations  Act  of  1899  (33  USC  403  et  sea.  - 

TN660)  Permit.  This  permit  would  be  issued  by  the  USACE  to  regulate  any  structure  or 
work  in,  over,  under,  or  affecting  waters  of  the  United  States,  such  as  construction  and 
maintenance  of  intake,  discharge,  and  barge  structures  in  navigable  waters  of  the  Delaware 
River.  This  permit  requires  both  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  Coastal  Zone  Management 
Program  concurrence. 

•  Section  9  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors  Appropriations  Act  of  1899  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  - 

TN660)  Permit.  This  permit  would  be  issued  by  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  (USCG)  to  regulate 
construction  of  the  causeway  across  Alloway  Creek. 

•  Coastal  Zone  Management  Act  of  1972  (16  USC  1451  et  seq.  -TN1243).  Federal 
Consistency  Determination  has  been  made  with  conditions  by  NJDEP  stating  that  the 
project  submitted  for  NRC  review  is  consistent  with  New  Jersey’s  Rules  on  Coastal  Zone 
Management  (NJDEP  2010-TN235).  Delaware  concurrence  would  be  required  for  the 
USACE  permit  action. 

•  CWA  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  Section  401  Water  Quality  Certification.  This 
certification  would  be  issued  by  NJDEP  and  ensures  that  the  project  would  not  conflict  with 
State  and  Federal  water-quality  management  programs.  This  includes  dredging  and 
dewatering  activities. 

•  CWA  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  Section  402(p)  National  Pollutant  Discharge 

Elimination  System  (NPDES)  Permit.  This  permit  regulates  limits  of  pollutants  in  liquid 
discharges  to  surface  water.  EPA  has  delegated  the  authority  for  administering  the  NPDES 
program  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey  to  NJDEP.  A  stormwater  pollution  prevention  plan 
(SWPPP)  and  activities  related  to  construction  dewatering  would  be  covered  as  part  of  the 
New  Jersey  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System  (NJPDES)  permit. 

•  NJDEP  permits  would  be  required  for  temporary  dewatering  and  for  the  associated  drilling  of 
dewatering  wells.

•  NJDEP  permits  would  be  required  for  construction  in  the  100-year  floodplain,  in  wetlands, 
and  below  the  mean  high  water  line. 

•  A  local  permit  would  be  required  to  construct  and  operate  a  system  for  treating  dewatering 
effluent. 

4.2.1  Hydrological  Alterations 

This  section  (1)  identifies  and  describes  proposed  preconstruction  and  construction  activities, 
including  site  preparation,  onsite  activities,  and  offsite  activities  that  could  result  in  hydrologic 
alterations;  (2)  describes  and  analyzes  the  resulting  hydrologic  alterations  and  the  physical 
effects  of  these  alterations  on  other  water  users:  (3)  analyzes  the  practices  proposed  to 
minimize  hydrologic  alterations  having  adverse  impacts:  and  (4)  assesses  compliance  with 
applicable  Federal,  State,  regional,  local,  and  affected  Native  American  Tribal  standards  and 
regulations. 

Activities  that  could  produce  hydrologic  alterations  include  the  following: 

•  raising  the  plant  grade  to  the  36.9-ft  North  American  Vertical  Datum  of  1988  (NAVD88) 
elevation,  including  filling  of  40  ac  of  artificial  lakes  in  the  PSEG  desilting  basin  and  the 
Artificial  Island  CDF; 

•  clearing  land  at  the  project  site  and  building  infrastructure  such  as  roads  and  stormwater 
conveyance  and  retention  systems; 

•  building  new  structures  (reactor  containment  structures,  turbine  buildings,  cooling  towers, 
electrical  substations,  subgrade  piping  and  systems),  roads/rails,  and  parking  lots; 

•  building  cooling  water  intake  and  discharge  structures  on  the  Delaware  River  shoreline; 

•  dredging  nearshore  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  for  water  intake,  water  discharge,  and 
barge  access  areas; 

•  modifying  the  existing  HCGS  barge  slip; 

•  temporary  disturbance  of  currently  vegetated  areas  and  wetlands  for  construction  laydown 
areas,  concrete  batch  plants,  sand/gravel  stockpiles,  and  construction-phase  parking  areas; 

•  dewatering  foundation  excavations  during  construction;  and 

•  building  the  proposed  causeway. 

4.2. 7. 7  Surface  Water 

Hydrologic  alterations  potentially  affecting  surface-water  resources  at  and  near  the  PSEG  Site 
may  occur  as  a  result  of  filling  of  shallow  artificial  lakes,  building  activities,  filling  of  coastal 
marshes  and  creeks,  building  activities  within  the  Delaware  River,  and  building  in  floodplains. 
These  activities  are  described  in  the  following  sections. 

Artificial  Lakes 

About  40  ac  of  shallow  artificial  lakes  (referred  to  here  as  desilt  basins)  that  exist  on  the  PSEG 
Site  and  the  Artificial  Island  CDF  would  be  filled  (see  Table  4-1).  These  desilt  basins  are 


November  2015 


4-13 


NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


normally  hydrologically  isolated  from  the  surrounding  landscape  (i.e. ,  have  no  surface-water 
flow  to  downstream  areas).  The  desilt  basins  currently  provide  some  retention  of  rainfall  and 
stormwater  runoff,  and  the  retained  water  is  lost  from  the  desilt  basins  by  infiltration  and 
evaporation.  As  a  result  of  filling  the  desilt  basins,  runoff  from  this  area  would  increase.  The 
runoff  would  be  collected  in  engineered  stormwater  detention  basins  and  would  be  released  to 
the  Delaware  River  in  a  controlled  manner  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Because  of  the  small  area  of 
the  desilt  basins  compared  to  the  area  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  near  the  PSEG  Site,  the 
increased  runoff  from  the  filled  area  is  expected  to  be  minor  compared  to  the  discharge  of  the 
Delaware  River.  Therefore,  filling  the  desilt  basins  is  not  expected  to  affect  any  downstream 
areas  noticeably. 

The  desilt  basins  are  identified  in  the  jurisdictional  determination  of  wetlands  conducted  by  the 
USACE  (2013-TN3283).  Impacts  to  wetlands  are  described  in  Section  4.3.1. 

Land  Disturbance 

Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  related  to  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  would  result  in  permanent  structures  occupying  about  225  ac.  This  would  include  108  ac  of 
lands  mapped  as  wetland  cover  type  and  43  ac  of  open  water  areas  associated  with  artificial 
lakes  and  tidal  waters  (see  Table  4-1 ).  Phragmites- dominated  coastal  and  interior  (nontidal) 
wetlands  account  for  1 02  ac  of  the  1 08  ac  of  wetlands  within  permanent  use  areas.  Actual 
disturbance  of  these  wetland  areas  would  be  further  refined  and  minimized  during  the  detailed 
design  phase  subsequent  to  the  selection  of  a  reactor  technology  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

In  addition  to  permanent  changes  in  land  use  within  the  PSEG  Site,  preconstruction  and 
construction  activities  would  result  in  temporary  changes  in  land  use  to  160  ac  within  the  PSEG 
Site  and  45  ac  in  adjacent  offsite  areas.  Lands  impacted  by  these  temporary  use  areas  would 
include  45  ac  of  developed  lands,  80  ac  of  disturbed  old  field  or  Phragmites-dominaied  old  field, 
and  about  32  ac  of  lands  mapped  by  NJDEP  as  wetlands  (Table  4-1 ).  Phragmites-6om\r\a\.e6 
interior  wetlands  (24  ac)  account  for  the  majority  of  wetland  impacts  in  these  temporary  use 
areas. 

The  45  ac  in  the  adjacent  offsite  Artificial  Island  CDF  would  also  be  used  temporarily  to  support 
building  activities.  A  total  of  42  ac  of  lands  mapped  as  wetlands  by  NJDEP  would  be  used  to 
support  the  batch  plant  and  other  temporary  uses.  The  primary  land  uses  impacted  in  this  area 
include  Phragmites-dominaied  wetlands  (coastal  and  interior,  29  ac)  and  disturbed  wetlands 
(modified,  12  ac)  (Table  4-1). 

The  proposed  causeway  would  provide  vehicular  access  to  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

A  total  of  69  ac  would  be  impacted  by  building  this  causeway,  45.5  ac  permanently  and  23.5  ac 
temporarily.  Permanent  impacts  would  result  from  the  placement  of  structures  (piers,  pilings,  or 
other  support  structures)  in  the  wetlands  and  shading  from  the  50-ft-wide  causeway. 

Temporary  impacts  would  result  from  the  temporary  placement  of  work  mats  on  the  wetlands  to 
support  equipment,  materials,  and  personnel.  The  majority  of  the  impacts  would  be  to  open 
water  and  wetlands.  Impacts  to  lands  mapped  as  agricultural  lands  would  account  for  12.6  ac 
of  the  69  ac,  while  open  water,  forest,  and  urban  land  use  would  account  for  the  remaining 
acreage  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 


NUREG-2168 


4-14 


November  2015 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Potential  erosion  and  sedimentation  from  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  would  be 
controlled  using  appropriate  best  management  practices  (BMPs)  as  specified  by  the  PSEG 
SWPPP  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  SWPPP  contains  an  inspection  and  monitoring  plan  for 
verifying  that  BMPs  are  working  following  rainfall  events  during  preconstruction  and 
construction.  Preconstruction  activities  would  include  the  development  of  features  that  function 
as  permanent  stormwater  management  systems.  Such  features  would  be  developed  in  the 
detailed  site  design  and  would  include  permanent  grading  and  drainage  features  to  manage 
stormwater  runoff.  Surface-water  discharges  would  be  managed  using  sediment  traps  and 
sedimentation  basins  to  remove  suspended  solids  before  discharge  to  the  Delaware  River. 
BMPs,  including  both  structural  and  nonstructural  BMPs,  would  be  implemented  as  required  in 
NJPDES  construction  activity  permits  and  regulations  to  reduce  erosion  and  minimize  the  risk  of 
discharges  of  all  pollutants  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Coastal  Wetland  and  Marsh  Creeks 

Coastal  streams  and  marsh  creeks  would  be  altered  by  filling  that  would  result  in  elimination  of 
7,265  ft  of  creek  channels  and  isolation  of  2,320  ft  of  creek  channels  from  tidal  connection. 
Additionally,  the  proposed  causeway  would  cross  2,123  ft  of  creek  channels.  PSEG  would  use 
BMPs  during  preconstruction  and  construction  activities,  and  those  activities  would  be 
temporary  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  elimination  of  7,265  ft  of  creek  channels  represents  a 
0.7  percent  decrease  in  total  creek  length  within  the  PSEG  EEP  area  and  an  even  smaller 
percentage  if  all  creeks  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  are  considered. 

Because  the  marsh  creeks  are  within  the  100-year  floodplain,  filling  them  would  result  in 
alterations  of  the  surface-water  pathways  and  surface  runoff  volume  and  discharge.  These 
alterations  could  affect  the  flood-carrying  capacity  of  the  floodplain.  However,  as  stated  in 
Section  2.3.1 .1 ,  the  100-year  floodplain  near  the  PSEG  Site  is  controlled  by  storm  surges,  and 
therefore,  the  contiguous  floodplain  is  vast,  consisting  of  low-lying  coastal  areas.  The  applicant 
estimated  that  the  area  of  the  1 00-year  floodplain  within  a  6-mi  radius  of  the  PSEG  Site  is 
59,681  ac  or  93.5  mi2  (PSEG  2012-TN2244).  Because  the  creek  channels  that  would  be 
eliminated  make  up  a  small  percentage  (not  exceeding  0.7  percent)  of  the  total  creek  length  in 
the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site,  the  loss  of  floodplain  adjacent  to  the  eliminated  marsh  creek 
channels  would  result  in  alteration  to  a  correspondingly  small  area  of  the  1 00-year  floodplain. 
Therefore,  the  review  team  determined  that  the  effect  on  the  100-year  floodplain  would  not  be 
noticeable.  Stormwater  runoff  from  this  area  would  be  collected  in  engineered  detention  basins 
and  would  be  released  to  the  Delaware  River  in  a  controlled  manner  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
Because  the  filling  of  marsh  creeks  is  expected  to  result  in  alteration  of  a  small  area  compared 
to  the  area  of  the  1 00-year  floodplain  near  the  PSEG  Site,  and  because  stormwater  runoff 
would  be  released  to  the  Delaware  River  in  a  controlled  manner,  the  effect  of  this  alteration  on 
the  100-year  floodplain  and  the  Delaware  River,  both  in  terms  of  water  quantity  and  quality, 
would  be  minimal. 

Isolation  of  marsh  creeks  from  tidal  connection  would  reduce  the  discharge  to  the  tidal  areas. 
However,  because  the  tidal  area  is  vast  and  the  expected  area  altered  by  isolation  of  marsh 
creek  is  also  small  compared  to  the  contiguous  floodplain  near  the  PSEG  Site,  the  effect  on  the 
tidal  areas  near  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minimal. 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


The  proposed  causeway  would  cross  marsh  creeks  and  would  have  landing  areas  for  piers  to 
support  the  elevated  roadway.  These  landing  areas  are  expected  to  be  few  and  would  also  be 
very  small  in  size  compared  to  the  tidal  areas  and  the  100-year  floodplain  near  the  PSEG  Site 
(PSEG  201 2-TN2244).  Because  the  crossing  of  the  marsh  creeks  by  the  proposed  causeway 
would  only  alter  small  areas  compared  to  the  tidal  areas  and  the  100-year  floodplain  near  the 
PSEG  Site,  and  because  BMPs  would  be  in  use  during  preconstruction  activities,  the  effect  of 
this  alteration  on  the  tidal  areas  and  the  100-year  floodplain  would  be  minimal. 

Delaware  River 

The  Delaware  River  near  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  altered  by  installation  of  the  new  intake 
structure  and  the  new  barge  facility  and  by  dredging  needed  for  installation  of  the  new 
structures  and  the  existing  HCGS  barge  slip  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  About  9.5  ac  of  coastal 
wetlands  and  shallow  water  areas  would  be  filled  along  the  Delaware  River  shoreline  near  the 
PSEG  Site.  The  altered  shoreline  would  be  protected  from  erosion  using  placement  of  concrete 
or  riprap.  The  shoreline  and  shallow  water  areas  would  be  dredged  to  provide  adequate  depth 
for  the  new  intake  and  the  new  barge  facility.  The  bottom  of  the  Delaware  River  near  the  new 
intake  and  the  new  barge  facility  would  be  deepened  4.5  ft  over  a  31 -ac  area,  and  4.5  ft  over  a 
61 -ac  area,  respectively.  The  dredged  area  would  extend  about  1,700  ft  laterally  from  the 
shoreline  into  the  river.  The  dredging  is  expected  to  enlarge  the  cross-sectional  area  of  the 
Delaware  River  by  2.5  to  3.5  percent,  which  could  result  in  a  proportionally  reduced  average 
velocity  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  However,  these  changes  are  expected  to  be  minimal  because 
they  are  a  small  percentage  of  the  total  area. 

The  material  dredged  from  the  Delaware  River  is  estimated  to  be  665,000  yd3  in  volume  and 
would  be  disposed  of  on  the  site  or  at  another  approved  upland  disposal  site.  PSEG  proposes 
to  use  hydraulic  suction  dredging  to  minimize  increases  in  turbidity  and  sedimentation  and  limit 
the  duration  of  dredging  (PSEG  2015-TN4234).  PSEG  would  be  required  to  comply  with 
requirements  of  CWA  Sections  10  and  404  and  NJDEP  permits.  PSEG  would  also  use  BMPs 
to  minimize  disturbance  of  bottom  sediment  and  its  delivery  farther  out  into  the  Delaware  River 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  These  preconstruction  activities  would  be  temporary  and  localized. 
Because  (1)  the  disturbance  to  the  Delaware  River  would  be  controlled  by  CWA  Sections  10 
and  404  and  NJDEP  permits  that  are  protective  of  the  environment  and  (2)  PSEG  would  use 
BMPs  and  the  preconstruction  activities  would  be  temporary  and  localized,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  the  effects  of  these  alterations  to  the  Delaware  River  would  be  minimal. 

Floodplains 

Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  would  alter  the  100-year  floodplain  near  the  PSEG 
Site  by  placing  fill  material  in  about  152  ac  of  onsite  and  offsite  areas.  As  described  in 
Section  2. 3. 1.1,  the  1  percent  annual  exceedance  flood  water  surface  elevation  at  the 
confluence  of  the  Delaware  River  and  Alloway  Creek  is  8.9  ft  National  Geodetic  Vertical  Datum 
of  1929  (NAVD29;  FEMA  1982-TN3214)  or  8.1  ft  NAVD88.  Because  the  100-year  floodplain 
near  the  PSEG  Site  is  controlled  by  storm  surges,  the  contiguous  floodplain  is  vast,  consisting 
of  the  low-lying  coastal  areas.  PSEG  estimated  that  the  area  of  the  100-year  floodplain  within  a 
6-mi  radius  of  the  PSEG  Site  is  59,681  ac  or  93.5  mi2  (PSEG  2012-TN2244).

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


The  filling  of  1 52  ac  on  and  off  the  site  in  the  1 00-year  floodplain  could  change  the  flood- 
carrying  capacity  of  the  floodplain.  However,  because  the  100-year  floodplain  at  and  near  the 
PSEG  Site  is  controlled  by  storm  surges  and  has  a  very  large,  contiguous  area  several  hundred 
times  larger  than  the  filled  area  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site,  the  review  team  concludes  that 
the  effects  of  this  alteration  on  the  100-year  floodplain  would  be  minimal. 

4. 2. 1.2  Groundwater 

Building  activities  that  are  expected  to  alter  groundwater  hydrology  at  the  PSEG  Site  are 
placement  of  high  hydraulic  conductivity  structural  fill  in  safety-related  excavations  (including  the 
nuclear  island),  placement  of  fill  to  raise  the  plant  grade  to  36.9  ft  NAVD88,  placement  of 
impervious  surfaces,  and  stormwater  rerouting.  In  addition,  a  low-permeability  curtain  wall 
would  be  placed  from  the  land  surface  partway  into  the  nuclear  island  excavation  to  reduce 
inflow  during  dewatering  operations.  These  activities  are  expected  to  minimally  alter  the  spatial 
and  temporal  pattern  of  infiltration  and  recharge  at  the  site  and  to  alter  groundwater  flow 
directions  in  the  shallow  aquifers  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  site.  Building  activities  that  are 
expected  to  alter  the  groundwater  hydrology  over  a  wider  area  are  dewatering  of  the 
construction  excavation  and  use  of  groundwater  to  support  construction  needs. 

Dewatering  would  be  required  during  construction  of  the  nuclear  island  and  would  reduce 
groundwater  heads  in  the  hydrogeologic  units  affected  by  the  excavation.  The  nuclear  island 
would  be  excavated  to  an  elevation  of  -67  ft  NAVD88,  which  is  through  the  hydraulic  fill,  the 
alluvium,  and  the  Cape  May  (identified  in  the  ER  as  the  Kirkwood)  Formation  and  into  the  top  of 
the  Vincentown  Formation  (see  Figure  2-18).  The  review  team  expects  that  the  effects  of 
dewatering  would  be  confined  to  the  shallow  alluvium  and  Vincentown  aquifer  due  to  the  low- 
permeability  formations  underlying  the  Vincentown  aquifer.  The  applicant  has  confirmed  plans 
to  use  vertical  low-permeability  barriers  to  limit  horizontal  inflow  into  the  excavation 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4283),  which  would  also  limit  the  horizontal  extent  of  the  effects  of  the 
dewatering.  In  addition,  a  drop  in  shallow  groundwater  elevation  as  a  result  of  dewatering  is  not 
expected  to  affect  water  levels  in  local  wetlands  because  of  the  poor  hydraulic  connection 
between  the  shallow  aquifers  and  the  wetlands  and  because  the  wetlands  are  hydraulically 
connected  (tidal)  to  the  Delaware  River  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Groundwater  from  four  production  wells  within  the  middle  and  lower  Potomac-Raritan-Magothy 
(PRM)  aquifers  is  currently  used  to  supply  water  for  operation  of  the  SGS  and  HCGS  units  at 
the  PSEG  Site.  There  are  also  two  unused  backup  wells  in  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer. 
To  support  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  an  additional  1 1 9  gpm  of  groundwater 
would  be  pumped  from  two  new  production  wells,  which  the  applicant  has  reported  would  be 
located  within  the  PRM  aquifers  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Based  on  current  permitted  pumping 
limits,  the  applicant  has  flexibility  to  locate  the  new  wells  in  the  upper,  middle,  or  lower  PRM 
aquifers.  Water  for  construction  would  be  for  potable  use,  for  dust  suppression,  and  to  supply 
water  to  the  concrete  batch  plant.  This  additional  groundwater  use  would  lower  groundwater 
heads  and  has  the  potential  to  affect  salinity  levels  within  the  PRM  aquifers.  However,  these 
effects  would  be  limited  due  to  several  factors:  NJDEP  water  management  practices,  which 
have  reduced  groundwater  use  within  the  PRM  aquifers  over  time;  the  small  contribution  of  site 
use  to  overall  regional  aquifer  use  and  aquifer  capacity;  limited  hydraulic  communication

between  the  PRM  aquifers  and  the  overlying  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer;  and  distance  to 
other  nearby  water  supply  wells. 

4.2.2  Water-Use  Impacts 

This  section  describes,  analyzes,  and  assesses  the  potential  water-use  impacts  of  building  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  It  includes  analysis  and  evaluation  of  proposed 
practices  to  minimize  adverse  impacts  on  water  use. 

4. 2. 2. 1  Surface-  Water-  Use  Impacts 

Surface  water  would  not  be  used  to  support  building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  brackish 
nature  of  the  Delaware  River  near  the  PSEG  Site  makes  the  surface  water  undesirable  for 
building.  Small  amounts  of  water  from  stormwater  retention  ponds  might  be  used  for  dust 
suppression  during  building  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Because  the 
amount  of  water  used  from  these  retention  ponds  would  be  relatively  small,  the  review  team 
determined  that  the  water-use  impacts  on  the  surface-water  resource  would  be  SMALL. 

4. 2. 2. 2  Groundwater-Use  Impacts 

As  described  in  Section  4. 2. 1.2,  a  number  of  construction-related  activities  could  alter 
groundwater  hydrology  at  and  near  the  site.  Placement  of  fill  to  raise  the  plant  grade, 
placement  of  structural  fill  in  safety-related  excavations,  placement  of  impervious  surfaces,  and 
stormwater  rerouting  would  affect  infiltration  and  recharge  at  the  site  and  alter  groundwater  flow 
directions  within  the  shallow  aquifers  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site.  However,  impacts  on 
groundwater  use  would  be  limited  because  the  construction  period  would  be  temporary  and  the 
aquifers  affected  are  hydraulically  isolated  by  the  Delaware  River  and  the  tidally  influenced 
wetlands.  In  addition,  the  nearest  groundwater  users  are  3  to  5  mi  from  the  site,  and  the 
shallow  aquifers  affected  by  construction  are  not  used  as  a  water  supply  source  due  to  their 
salinity. 

The  greatest  potential  effects  of  construction  on  groundwater  uses  and  users  would  be  from  two 
primary  activities:  (1)  dewatering  to  facilitate  power  block  construction  and  (2)  groundwater 
pumping  for  preconstruction  and  construction  support  (including  concrete  batch  plant  supply, 
potable  water,  and  dust  suppression). 

Dewatering 

During  construction,  excavation  would  occur  throughout  the  entire  plant  area.  The  deepest 
excavation  would  occur  at  the  nuclear  island  foundation  where  the  hydraulic  fill,  alluvium,  and 
Cape  May  (identified  in  the  ER  as  the  Kirkwood)  Formation  would  be  completely  removed.  The 
nuclear  island  excavation  would  extend  to  a  competent  foundation  layer  within  the  Vincentown 
Formation  at  an  elevation  of  about  -67  ft  NAVD88.  There  would  be  two  sets  of  dewatering 
wells:  a  shallow  set  along  the  perimeter  of  the  plant  area  excavation  and  a  deeper  set  installed 
along  the  perimeter  of  the  deeper  nuclear  island  excavation.  Dewatering  flow  rates  would  be 
reduced  by  the  installation  of  low-permeability  soil-retention  barriers  along  both  the  shallow  and 
deep  excavation  perimeter  walls  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283).

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


The  applicant  used  groundwater  flow  modeling  to  determine  dewatering  rates  and  the  effects  of 
dewatering  on  existing  structures  important  to  safety  at  the  HCGS  and  SGS.  The  applicant’s 
dewatering  model  (MACTEC  2009-TN3323)  was  based  on  site-specific  geology  and  either 
site-specific  (when  available)  or  regional  values  for  hydraulic  conductivity  and  other  hydraulic 
parameters.  The  dewatering  model  considered  all  geologic  layers  from  the  hydraulic  fill  at  the 
land  surface  to  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer,  which  is  underlain  by  the  Marshalltown 
aquitard.  The  groundwater  dewatering  model  domain  covered  the  PSEG  Site  and  extended 
7,520  ft  in  a  north-south  direction  and  7,000  ft  in  an  east-west  direction.  The  model  was 
bounded  to  the  west  and  south  by  the  Delaware  River  and  to  the  north  and  east  by  tidally 
recharged  wetland  areas.  Because  the  domain  of  the  model  was  constrained  to  the  site  vicinity, 
the  review  team  concluded  that  the  results  could  not  be  used  as  the  sole  basis  for  estimating 
impacts  to  groundwater  beyond  the  tidally  recharged  wetland  areas. 

The  model  results  were  used  by  the  review  team  to  inform  the  evaluation  of  offsite  impacts. 
Based  on  the  results  of  modeling,  PSEG  estimated  that  initial  dewatering  rates  would  be 
between  5,200  and  5,600  gpm,  but  as  the  shallow  groundwater  system  adjusted  to  pumping, 
the  rate  would  diminish  over  time  to  between  3,400  and  5,400  gpm.  These  rates  do  not  include 
influx  of  water  from  storm  events,  which  would  be  temporary  and  involve  a  relatively  small 
volume  of  water  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  The  greatest  drawdown  in  groundwater  head  is 
predicted  to  occur  within  the  Vincentown  aquifer.  The  extent  of  drawdown  would  be  limited  west 
and  south  of  the  site  because  the  Vincentown  aquifer  is  hydraulically  connected  to  the  Delaware 
River.  If  drawdown  extends  beyond  the  site  boundary  to  the  north  and  east,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  the  impact  on  groundwater  use  would  be  limited  because  salinity  within  the 
Vincentown  aquifer  is  well  above  drinking  water  standards  and  the  aquifer  is  not  used  as  a 
source  of  potable  water  near  the  site.  Because  the  nearest  offsite  groundwater  use  is  3  to  5  mi 
from  the  site,  and  the  most  significant  drawdown  is  largely  confined  to  the  site,  dewatering 
during  construction  is  not  expected  to  affect  other  uses  and  users  of  groundwater  near  the  site. 

During  dewatering,  it  is  possible  that  pumping  might  induce  flow  upward  from  the  Wenonah- 
Mount  Laurel  aquifer  through  the  Navesink-Hornerstown  aquitard  and  into  the  Vincentown 
aquifer.  The  applicant’s  model  did  not  specify  the  amount  of  potential  upwelling  from  the 
Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer,  but  potential  flow  amounts  could  be  inferred  based  upon  the 
applicant’s  sensitivity  analysis.  In  this  analysis,  when  vertical  conductivity  of  the  Navesink 
aquitard  was  reduced  by  a  factor  of  2  and  all  other  parameters  were  held  constant,  total  flow  out 
of  the  wells  was  reduced  by  about  200  gpm  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  This  indicated  that  during 
pumping,  200  gpm  or  more  could  be  pulled  upward  from  the  Navesink  aquitard  and  the 
underlying  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer. 

The  review  team  performed  calculations  to  independently  verify  the  amount  of  potential  upward 
flow  induced  by  dewatering.  Based  on  the  drawdown  contours  shown  in  Figure  2.4.12-27  of  the 
PSEG  SSAR  (PSEG  2015-TN4283)  and  a  vertical  hydraulic  conductivity  of  the  Navesink- 
Hornerstown  confining  unit  of  0.005  ft/d,  consistent  with  SSAR  Table  2.4.12-1  and  information 
provided  by  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  (Voronin  2003-TN2947),  upward  flow  during 
dewatering  was  estimated  to  be  150  gpm.  This  relatively  small  amount  of  upward  flow  is  not 
likely  to  significantly  affect  flows  in  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer,  particularly  since  the 
impact  would  be  temporary.  In  addition,  the  nearest  wells  potentially  within  the  Wenonah-Mount 
Laurel  aquifer  are  the  HCGS  and  SGS  standby  potable  water  supply  wells,  which  are  not

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


routinely  pumped.  As  discussed  in  Section  2.3,  the  nearest  offsite  wells  are  several  miles  away. 
Because  of  their  distance  from  the  PSEG  Site,  these  wells  are  not  likely  to  be  affected  by  the 
upward  flow  induced  by  dewatering. 

The  shallow  hydraulic  fills  act  as  an  aquitard  that  currently  creates  perched  conditions.  The 
applicant  has  stated  that  during  completion  of  the  nuclear  island  the  excavation  would  be 
completely  backfilled  with  a  structural  fill  that  would  form  a  permeable  hydraulic  conduit 
connecting  the  perched  groundwater  with  the  Vincentown  aquifer.  As  a  result,  the 
potentiometric  surface  in  this  area  in  these  aquifers  would  be  similar,  and  dewatering  might 
induce  flow  from  the  river  and  nearby  wetlands.  Any  potential  impact  on  wetlands  would  be 
localized  and  would  be  offset  by  the  twice-daily  tidal  recharge. 

Groundwater  Pumping  for  Preconstruction  and  Construction  Support 

Water-use  requirements  for  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  plant  are  similar  to  those  for  other 
large  industrial  construction  projects.  Building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  use  on  average  119  gpm  of  groundwater  to  support  concrete  batch  plant  operations, 
dust  suppression,  and  potable  use  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  existing  water  supply  system 
currently  provides  379  gpm  to  support  HCGS  and  SGS  operations.  The  existing  water 
allocation  permits  allow  for  an  additional  withdrawal  of  sufficient  capacity  to  provide  the 
groundwater  needed  to  support  new  plant  construction  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Water-use  impacts  from  the  withdrawal  of  groundwater  to  support  plant  operations  are 
evaluated  in  Section  5. 2. 2. 2  and  are  determined  to  be  SMALL.  The  same  wells  would  be  used 
to  supply  groundwater  for  construction  and  for  plant  operation.  Because  the  construction- 
related  groundwater  use  (119  gpm)  would  be  less  than  the  proposed  use  for  plant  operation 
(210  gpm)  and  construction  withdrawals  would  occur  for  a  shorter  period  of  time,  water-use 
impacts  from  construction  would  be  bounded  by  the  impacts  from  operation.  The  review  team 
therefore  concludes  that  water-use  impacts  from  groundwater  withdrawals  to  support 
construction  would  be  minor. 

Groundwater-Use  Impacts  Summary 

Factors  that  would  limit  the  impacts  of  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  on 
groundwater  use  in  the  area  are  (1 )  the  temporary  nature  of  excavation  dewatering  and  the 
planned  use  of  low-permeability  soil-retention  barriers  to  limit  inflow  from  surrounding  shallow 
formations;  (2)  the  alluvium  and  Vincentown  aquifer  have  salinity  levels  above  drinking  water 
standards,  are  not  potable,  and  are  not  used  near  the  site;  and  (3)  potential  impacts  to  shallow 
water-bearing  units  may  be  offset  by  inflows  from  the  Delaware  River  and  tidally  influenced 
wetlands.  In  addition,  impacts  from  construction  pumping  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer  are 
bounded  by  the  impacts  from  pumping  to  support  plant  operation,  which  the  review  team 
determined  to  be  SMALL  (Section  5. 2. 2. 2).  As  a  result,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the 
groundwater-use  impacts  of  construction  and  preconstruction  would  be  SMALL  and  no  further 
mitigation  would  be  warranted.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


4.2.3  Water-Quality  Impacts 

The  water-quality  impacts  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  are  similar  to  those  associated 
with  the  development  of  any  large  industrial  site.  This  section  includes  identification  of  the 
activities  associated  with  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  related  to  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  that  could  affect  surface  and  groundwater  quality  and  analysis 
and  evaluation  of  proposed  practices  to  minimize  adverse  impacts  on  water  quality  by  these 
activities.  The  impacts  on  surface  water  and  groundwater  are  discussed  in  Section  4.2.3. 1  and 
Section  4. 2. 3. 2,  respectively. 

4.2.3. 7  Surface-  Water-  Quality  Impacts 

As  with  any  similar  large  building  project,  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
could  affect  nearby  surface  water  bodies  during  site-preparation  and  building  activities.  The 
site-preparation  and  building  activities  that  could  affect  surface  water  include  clearing 
vegetation,  disturbing  the  land  surface,  inadvertent  release  of  contaminants  associated  with 
building  materials  and  equipment,  activities  in  the  tidal  marsh  and  tidal  stream  areas  during 
building  of  the  proposed  causeway,  and  dredging  activities  in  the  Delaware  River.  Because  of 
alteration  of  the  land  surface,  alteration  of  surface  cover,  and  changes  to  drainage  patterns, 
both  the  quantity  and  quality  of  the  surface  runoff  from  the  site  may  change  and  result  in 
impacts  to  the  quality  of  the  surface-water  resources  near  the  site. 

Because  a  reactor  design  for  the  PSEG  Site  has  not  been  finalized,  the  details  of  site  layout, 
grading  plan,  and  drainage  design  have  not  been  determined.  However,  PSEG  estimates  that  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  would  require  permanent  development  of  about  50  ac  of  onsite  land 
and  temporary  use  of  about  39  ac  of  onsite  and  3  ac  of  offsite  lands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
These  areas  would  be  cleared  and  regraded  and  would  host  construction  material  and 
equipment.  As  stated  in  Section  3. 4. 2. 2,  the  site  would  be  graded  such  that  runoff  from  the  site 
and  power  block  area  would  be  directed  to  a  system  of  swales  and  pipes  that  would  discharge 
to  the  Delaware  River.  The  site  would  drain  to  the  north  and  west,  away  from  the  existing  SGS 
and  HCGS  facilities.  PSEG  would  be  required  to  obtain  an  NJPDES  permit  for  stormwater 
discharges  resulting  from  the  building  activities  and  to  develop  an  SWPPP  that  defined  BMPs 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

BMPs  could  consist  of  structural  (such  as  the  use  of  sedimentation  basins)  and  nonstructural 
(such  as  erosion  control)  methods  to  meet  discharge  water-quality  requirements.  The  nature 
of  the  PSEG  Site,  the  building  methods  used,  available  sediment,  and  potential  contaminants 
related  to  building  activities  are  not  substantially  different  from  any  other  large-scale  project. 
BMPs  have  been  successfully  used  in  SWPPPs  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  runoff  from  building 
sites  and  to  minimize  contaminants  that  adversely  affect  water  quality.  The  Delaware  River 
would  receive  the  stormwater  discharge  from  the  PSEG  Site.  The  Delaware  River  near  the 
PSEG  Site  is  influenced  by  tidal  action,  and  the  tidal  flux  greatly  exceeds  the  freshwater 
discharge  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Therefore,  the  review  team  has  determined  that  the 
controlled  release  of  stormwater  discharge  would  have  minimal  impact  on  the  Delaware  River 
near  the  PSEG  Site.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


To  support  building  the  new  intake  structure,  the  new  discharge  pipeline,  and  the  new  barge 
slip,  dredging  and  filling  within  the  Delaware  River  would  be  required.  In  addition,  the  existing 
barge  slip  would  be  deepened  and  therefore  would  require  dredging.  To  build  the  new  barge 
facility  and  the  new  intake  structure,  the  Delaware  River  bottom  would  be  lowered  4.5  ft  over  a 
92-ac  area,  requiring  dredging  of  665,000  yd3  of  sediment  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  dredged 
area  would  extend  1 ,700  ft  into  the  Delaware  River  from  the  shoreline.  The  dredged  material 
would  be  disposed  of  at  an  onsite  or  other  approved  upland  disposal  facility  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  Sediment  disturbed  during  these  activities  would  settle  after  the  activities  were 
completed  and  is  not  expected  to  have  a  long-term  impact.  The  area  of  these  activities  would 
be  a  small  fraction  of  the  area  of  the  Delaware  Bay  and  Delaware  River  Estuary,  and  the 
dredged  and  deepened  area  would  increase  the  Delaware  River  cross  section  by  less  than 
3.5  percent.  The  total  volume  of  sediments  to  be  dredged  for  the  proposed  plant  would  be 
about  4  percent  of  the  initial  dredged  volume  for  the  main  channel  deepening  project,  which  the 
USACE  concluded  would  have  water-quality  impacts  that  are  not  significant  (USACE  1997- 
TN2281;  USACE  2009-TN2663;  USACE  2011-TN2262;  USACE  2013-TN2851 ).  As  described 
in  Section  2.3.3. 1,  the  majority  of  sediment  samples  in  Delaware  River  Basin  Commission 
(DRBC)  Water  Quality  Zone  5  (where  Artificial  Island  is  located)  evaluated  in  the  Delaware 
Estuary  Regional  Sediment  Management  Plan  (DERSMPW  2013-TN4204)  were  determined  to 
be  suitable  or  potentially  suitable  for  aquatic  habitat  and  upland  beneficial  uses. 

Dredging  activities  would  require  permits  under  Section  10  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors 
Appropriation  Act  of  1899  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  -TN660)  for  dredging  and  filling  in  the  navigable 
waters  of  the  United  States  and  Section  404  of  the  CWA  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  for 
dredging  and  filling  in  waters  of  the  United  States.  Specific  sediment  sampling,  water-quality 
monitoring,  and  BMPs  would  also  be  required  as  part  of  the  NJDEP  dredging  permit  process 
(NJDEP  1997-TN4206).  Dredging  and  filling  activities  would  be  temporary  and  occur  during  the 
building,  placement,  or  improvement  of  the  facilities.  BMPs  would  be  used  during  the  dredging 
activity.  Therefore,  the  review  team  has  determined  that  dredging  and  filling  activities  in  the 
Delaware  River  for  building  new  facilities  and  improvement  of  existing  facilities  would  cause  only 
a  minor  and  temporary  impact  to  surface-water  quality. 

The  proposed  causeway  would  be  an  elevated  structure,  but  the  landing  sites  of  piers  would 
require  building  activities  in  coastal  wetlands  and  marshes.  The  building  activities  would  be 
limited  to  the  landing  sites  of  piers  and  to  any  needed  access  roads.  Because  of  the  elevated, 
spanned  nature  of  the  causeway,  placement  of  fill  in  the  coastal  area  would  be  minimized.  The 
causeway  would  cross  2,123  ft  of  marsh  creeks  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Building  the  causeway 
would  be  similar  to  building  any  other  elevated  roadway,  and  building  techniques  for  pier  landing 
areas  would  also  be  similar  and  use  sediment  erosion  and  delivery  control  methods  similar  to 
other  construction  activities.  Because  the  causeway  would  cross  navigable  waters,  PSEG 
would  be  required  to  obtain  a  permit  from  the  USCG  under  Section  9  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors 
Appropriation  Act  of  1899  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  -TN660)  and  a  permit  from  the  USACE  under 
Section  404  of  the  CWA  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662).  The  potential  impact  to  water  quality 
due  to  sediment  delivery  from  building  areas  for  the  causeway  would  also  be  temporary  and 
localized.  Because  building  techniques  would  help  reduce  the  volume  of  fill,  sediment  erosion 
and  delivery  controls  would  be  used,  appropriate  permits  would  require  the  applicant  to 
minimize  impacts  to  water  quality,  and  any  potential  impacts  would  be  localized  and  temporary,

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


the  review  team  has  determined  that  the  impacts  to  water  quality  from  building  the  proposed 
causeway  would  be  minor. 

Because  engineering  controls  (BMPs,  silt  fences,  detention  basins,  etc.)  regulated  by  a 
combination  of  NJPDES  and  USACE  permitting  would  be  in  use  during  building  activities,  the 
building-related  impacts  on  surface-water  quality  would  be  controlled,  localized,  and  temporary. 
Therefore,  the  review  team  has  determined  that  the  impacts  on  surface-water  quality  would  be 
SMALL. 

4. 2. 3. 2  Groundwater-  Quality  Impacts 

The  site-preparation  and  building  activities  that  could  affect  groundwater  include  inadvertent 
chemical  spills,  excavation  dewatering,  discharge  of  groundwater  to  adjacent  surface  water 
bodies,  and  use  of  groundwater  from  the  PRM  aquifers.  Potential  groundwater-quality  impacts 
from  these  activities  are  discussed  below. 

During  preconstruction  and  construction,  gasoline,  diesel  fuel,  hydraulic  lubricants,  and  other 
similar  products  would  be  used  for  construction  equipment.  BMPs  would  be  used  to  minimize 
potential  discharges  to  the  environment.  NJDEP  requires  that  chemical  discharges  to  the  soils 
and  groundwater  be  reported  and  subsequently  remediated  to  prevent  longer  term  impacts  to 
groundwater  quality  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Based  on  the  use  of  BMPs  and  NJDEP  remediation 
requirements,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  effect  on  groundwater  quality  of  an 
inadvertent  chemical  spill  would  be  localized  and  temporary.  As  a  result,  the  impacts  to 
groundwater  quality  would  be  minor. 

Dewatering  the  power  block  area  would  alter  the  shallow  groundwater  flow  patterns,  but  it  is  not 
anticipated  to  alter  groundwater  quality.  Because  the  two  upper  water-bearing  zones,  the 
alluvium  and  the  Vincentown  aquifer,  are  in  hydraulic  communication  with  the  Delaware  River, 
saline  water  from  the  river  may  be  drawn  into  the  groundwater  as  a  result  of  the  dewatering. 
However,  the  alluvium  and  Vincentown  aquifer  are  currently  too  saline  to  be  used  as  a  potable 
water  source  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Likewise,  any  upward 
groundwater  flow  from  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer  induced  by  the  dewatering  would  not 
adversely  affect  the  water  quality  of  the  saline  water  in  the  Vincentown  aquifer. 

Other  potential  effects  associated  with  the  dewatering  of  the  power  block  area  pertain  to  the 
release  of  the  excess  water  to  adjoining  water  bodies.  Groundwater  pumped  from  dewatering 
wells  within  the  construction  areas  would  be  free  of  fine  materials  due  to  the  use  of  well  screens 
and  would  be  discharged  directly  to  the  Delaware  River.  Water  withdrawn  from  open  surface 
excavations  would  be  pumped  to  an  onsite  settling  basin  before  being  discharged  through  a 
permitted  NJPDES  outfall.  PSEG  would  develop  BMPs  for  soil  erosion  control  as  required  by 
applicable  Federal  and  State  permits  and  regulations.  Once  dewatering  is  no  longer  needed, 
the  water  table  is  expected  to  return  to  static  conditions. 

As  discussed  in  Section  4. 2. 2. 2,  during  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  an  additional 
119  gpm  of  groundwater  for  potable  use,  dust  suppression,  and  the  concrete  batch  plant  would 
be  supplied  from  two  new  production  wells  within  the  PRM  aquifer  zones  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 
This  additional  groundwater  use  has  the  potential  to  impact  salinity  levels  within  the  PRM

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


aquifers.  Because  the  construction-related  groundwater  use  (119  gpm)  is  less  than  the 
proposed  use  for  plant  operation  (210  gpm),  and  construction  withdrawals  would  occur  for  a 
shorter  period  of  time,  water-quality  impacts  from  construction  would  be  bounded  by  the  impacts 
from  operation.  Groundwater-quality  impacts  from  plant  operation  are  discussed  in 
Section  5. 2. 3. 2  and  are  determined  to  be  SMALL.  The  review  team  therefore  concludes  that 
water-quality  impacts  from  groundwater  withdrawals  to  support  construction  would  be  minor. 

Factors  that  would  limit  the  impacts  of  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  on 
groundwater  quality  in  the  area  are  (1 )  the  use  of  PSEG  BMPs  for  spill  prevention  and  cleanup; 

(2)  the  temporary  nature  of  excavation  dewatering  and  construction-related  pumping;  and 

(3)  the  fact  that  the  alluvium  and  Vincentown  aquifer  have  salinity  levels  above  drinking  water 
standards,  are  not  potable  water  sources,  and  are  not  used  near  the  site.  In  addition,  impacts 
from  construction  pumping  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer  are  bounded  by  the  impacts  from 
pumping  to  support  plant  operation,  which  were  determined  by  the  review  team  to  be  SMALL 
(Section  5. 2. 3. 2).  As  a  result,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  impacts  of  the  proposed 
action  on  groundwater  quality  would  be  limited  in  magnitude,  localized,  and  temporary,  and 
therefore  SMALL. 

4.2.4  Hydrological  Monitoring 

Proposed  hydrological  and  chemical  monitoring  during  preconstruction  and  construction  are 
described  in  Sections  6.3.2  and  6.6.2  of  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Water 
discharges  during  building  activities  would  be  monitored  in  accordance  with  applicable  NJPDES 
permit  requirements  and  State  water-quality  standards  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Stormwater  and 
dewatering  discharges  would  be  monitored.  PSEG  would  be  required  to  develop  an  SWPPP 
that  would  specify  the  inspection  methods  and  BMPs  used  to  limit  the  impacts  of  construction 
discharges  to  surface  water  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  In  addition,  any  known  chemical,  fuel  oil,  or 
hydraulic  fluid  spills  would  be  reported  to  NJDEP  and  remediated  according  to  New  Jersey  spill 
response  requirements  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Delaware  River  monitoring  required  by  HCGS 
and  SGS  permits  would  continue  during  preconstruction  and  construction  activities. 

Groundwater  levels  would  be  monitored  in  existing  shallow  wells  to  confirm  that  the  HCGS  and 
SGS  facilities  are  not  adversely  affected  by  dewatering  and  to  evaluate  any  changes  in  water 
quality  to  the  alluvium  and  Vincentown  aquifer.  Monitoring  of  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  and 
PRM  aquifers  required  by  the  HCGS  and  SGS  water  allocation  permit  would  continue  during 
preconstruction  and  construction  activities,  providing  data  on  groundwater  heads  and  salinity  in 
these  aquifers. 

Water-quality  samples  would  be  collected,  preserved  (if  applicable),  and  transported  according 
to  NJDEP  chain  of  custody  requirements  and  those  of  the  analytical  laboratory  performing  the 
analyses  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  NRC  staff  has  verified  that  the  analytical  laboratories 
used  by  PSEG  are  certified  by  NJDEP. 

4.3  Ecological  Impacts 

If  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  were  to  be  constructed  at  the  PSEG  Site,  preconstruction  activities 
would  start  with  site  mobilization,  including  building  the  causeway,  barge  facility,  laydown  areas,

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


heavy  haul  road,  and  temporary  utility  supply  systems.  This  preconstruction/site  mobilization 
phase  would  continue  for  1  to  3  years,  during  which  time  most  impacts  to  onsite  terrestrial 
habitats,  wetlands,  marsh  creeks,  and  artificial  ponds  would  occur.  Construction-phase  impacts 
would  occur  over  a  period  of  about  5  years,  when  site  activities  would  include  site  excavation 
and  construction  of  safety-related  structures  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Section  4.3.1  provides  a  discussion  of  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  preconstruction 
and  construction  upon  terrestrial  resources,  while  Section  4.3.2  provides  a  discussion  of  the 
potential  impacts  upon  aquatic  resources. 

4.3.1  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Impacts 

This  section  describes  potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  resources  resulting  from  preconstruction 
and  construction  activities,  which  are  also  referred  to  as  building  activities,  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

4. 3. 7. 7  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Resources  -  Site  and  Vicinity 

Impacts  on  Habitats 

Proposed  ground-disturbing  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  offsite  areas  are  based  on  the 
PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  (Figure  2-2)  in  Section  2.1  and  uses  NJDEP  LULC  classification 
system.  Permanent  land  impacts  are  represented  by  crosshatched  areas  and  temporary  land 
impacts  by  diagonally  hatched  areas  in  Figure  2-2.  Potential  areas  of  impact  include  the  power 
block,  cooling  tower,  concrete  batch  plant,  intake  structure,  switchyard,  offices  and  warehouses, 
heavy  haul  road,  temporary  laydown  areas,  parking  areas,  and  proposed  causeway.  Building 
activities  include  clearing,  grubbing,  and  grading  the  site;  installing  erosion-control  measures; 
building  access  and  haul  roads;  installing  construction  security  infrastructure;  installing 
temporary  utilities  and  facilities  (e.g.,  storage  warehouses,  concrete  batch  plant);  preparing  the 
laydown,  fabrication,  and  shop  areas;  relocating  existing  facilities  within  the  PSEG  Site;  staging 
equipment;  and  conducting  preparation  activities  associated  with  power  plant  construction 
support.  The  applicant  has  not  determined  the  type  of  reactor  to  be  built  on  the  site  and  is  using 
a  plant  parameter  envelope  (PPE)  to  bound  associated  construction  and  preconstruction 
impacts.  The  terrestrial  ecology  impacts  represented  in  this  section  are  based  on  the  PPE,  and 
the  actual  limits  of  disturbance  (particularly  wetlands  and  jurisdictional  streams)  may  be  further 
minimized  during  the  design  phase  after  a  specific  reactor  technology  is  selected.  PSEG 
anticipates  that  once  a  design  is  selected,  and  if  the  NRC  approves  of  a  CP  or  COL, 
construction  and  preconstruction  activities  could  take  68  months  to  complete  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

Building  activities  would  result  in  the  permanent  or  temporary  disturbance  of  about  385  ac  of  the 
PSEG  Site,  45  ac  of  adjacent  offsite  areas,  and  69  ac  of  the  habitat  in  the  area  of  the  proposed 
causeway  (see  Figure  4-1 ,  Table  4-1 ,  and  Table  4-2).  The  45-ac  offsite  area  is  currently  owned 
by  the  USACE  and  is  used  as  a  CDF  for  disposal  of  dredge  materials.  In  addition,  the  permitted 
disposal  facility  on  the  PSEG  Site  is  used  for  disposal  of  materials  dredged  from  the  intake 
structures  of  HCGS  and  SGS.  Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  that  would  impact 
terrestrial  habitats  include  clearing  and  grubbing,  site  grading  of  upland  areas,  excavation,  and 
filling  of  various  site  areas  to  achieve  design  grades  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


A  total  of  205  ac  of  the  impacted  area  is  considered  temporary  (Table  4-1 ).  This  includes 
159.9  ac  on  the  site,  45.2  ac  on  adjacent  offsite  areas,  and  land  disturbances  during 
development  of  the  proposed  causeway  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Urban  or  Built-Up  Land  (Developed  Land) 

About  91  ac  or  26  percent  of  urban  or  built-up  land  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  used  during 
construction  and  preconstruction  activities.  Temporary  uses  would  account  for  almost  45  ac. 
Permanent  use  would  account  for  about  47  ac  or  1 3  percent  of  the  urban  or  built-up  land  used 
on  the  site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Offsite  impacts  to  urban  or  built-up  land  would  also  occur  in  the  adjacent  offsite  areas  and  along 
the  proposed  causeway  route.  Building  activities  in  the  adjacent  offsite  areas  would  temporarily 
make  use  of  2.4  ac  of  urban  or  built-up  lands.  The  proposed  causeway  would  permanently  use 
4.2  ac  and  temporarily  use  1 .4  ac  of  developed  lands  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

A  total  of  271  ac  of  the  affected  terrestrial  habitat  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity  would  be 
permanently  converted  to  developed  land  uses  containing  structures  or  pavement  or  other 
intensively  maintained  exterior  grounds.  There  is  about  939  ac  of  developed  land  in  the  vicinity 
and  630,938  ac  in  the  region.  The  proposed  action  would  add  an  additional  23  percent  of 
developed  land  uses  to  the  vicinity  and  make  use  of  about  6  percent  of  the  available  developed 
lands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  These  land  areas  on  the  site  or  in  the  vicinity  have  limited  value 
for  wildlife. 

Forestland 


Forestland  cover  type  is  mainly  present  in  the  southeast  portion  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Scattered 
old  field  communities  consisting  of  one  or  more  land-cover  types  also  occur  sporadically  in  the 
north  and  west  portions  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Construction  and  preconstruction  activities  would 
disturb  about  89  ac  of  the  available  forestland  on  the  site.  Permanent  use  would  result  in  the 
loss  of  8.7  ac  of  forestland,  and  80.3  ac  would  be  temporarily  disturbed.  The  permanent  change 
of  land  use  would  result  in  the  loss  of  about  8  percent  of  the  available  forestland  on  the  site. 

The  majority  of  the  onsite  forestland  to  be  permanently  lost  is  designated  as  deciduous 
brush/shrubland  habitat  (6  ac)  and  old  field  (<25  percent  brush  covered)  (2.6  ac)  under  the  New 
Jersey  LULC  system  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Less  than  1  ac  of  forestland  would  be  temporarily  disturbed  and  3.5  ac  would  permanently 
change  as  a  result  of  building  the  proposed  causeway.  No  forestland  would  be  disturbed  in 
adjacent  offsite  areas  during  building  activities  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

There  are  about  2,653  ac  of  forestland  available  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site,  and 
construction  and  preconstruction  activities  would  permanently  remove  less  than  1  percent  of 
that  available  habitat  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  impact  to  forestland  from  construction  and 
preconstruction  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  result  in  a  noticeable  impact  to  forestlands 
in  the  vicinity. 


NUREG-2168

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Water 

The  proposed  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  would  disturb  about  44  ac  of  water 
habitats  on  the  PSEG  Site.  About  40  ac  of  artificial  lakes  and  nearly  3  ac  of  tidal  rivers,  inland 
bays,  and  other  tidal  waters  would  be  permanently  disturbed.  The  permanent  loss  represents 
about  94  percent  of  the  available  water  habitats  on  the  site.  Less  than  1  ac  on  the  site  would  be 
temporarily  disturbed  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Building  activities  on  adjacent  offsite  areas  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  disturb  about 
5  ac  of  available  water  habitat  in  these  areas.  Temporary  disturbances  include  less  than  1  ac 
in  adjacent  offsite  areas  and  about  2  ac  in  the  causeway.  Permanent  losses  off  the  site  would 
occur  only  in  the  proposed  causeway  area,  and  losses  would  be  about  2  ac  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

There  are  about  26,837  ac  of  water  habitat  in  the  vicinity.  The  permanent  loss  of  this  habitat 
on  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity  represents  less  than  1  percent  of  the  total  available  habitat 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  loss  of  these  areas  would  not  have  a  noticeable  effect  on  the 
available  habitat  in  the  vicinity. 

Wetlands 


Wetlands  are  mainly  located  in  the  extreme  eastern  and  northern  portions  of  the  PSEG  Site  and 
represent  one  of  the  largest  available  habitats  on  the  site.  Building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
would  permanently  disturb  108  ac  of  wetlands,  including  0.1  ac  of  saline  marsh,  58.3  ac  of 
Phragmites-dom\na\ed  coastal  wetlands,  0.9  ac  of  herbaceous  wetlands,  4.6  ac  of  deciduous 
scrub/shrub  wetlands,  and  44.1  ac  of  Phragmites-d o m i n ated  interior  wetlands.  There  would  be 
31.8  ac  of  temporary  impacts  on  the  site,  including  5.1  ac  of  Phragmites- dominated  coastal 
wetlands,  2.5  ac  of  herbaceous  wetlands,  and  24.2  ac  of  Phragmites- dominated  interior 
wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Offsite  impacts  to  wetlands  from  building  activities  in  the  offsite  adjacent  areas  and  the 
proposed  causeway  would  total  72.8  ac.  A  permanent  loss  of  23  ac  would  occur  in  the  wetlands 
associated  with  the  proposed  causeway  and  include  losses  of  6.1  ac  of  freshwater  tidal  marsh, 

1 1.2  ac  of  Phragmites-dom\na\.ed  coastal  wetlands,  1.2  ac  of  herbaceous  wetlands,  0.1  ac  of 
mixed  scrub/shrub  wetlands  (coniferous  dominated),  and  4.4  ac  of  Phragmites- dominated 
interior  wetlands.  A  total  of  49.8  ac  would  be  temporarily  disturbed,  including  6.6  ac  of 
freshwater  tidal  marshes,  13.2  ac  of  Phragmites- dominated  coastal  wetlands,  29.2  ac  of 
Phragmites-dom\na\.ed  interior  wetlands,  and  0.8  ac  of  saline  marsh  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Potential  impacts  to  wetland  plant  communities  may  consist  of  actual  direct  damage  to  plants, 
compaction  of  wetland  soils,  and  short-term  reductions  in  productivity.  The  proposed  causeway 
would  be  designed  as  an  elevated  structure  to  minimize  potential  impacts  to  plant  communities. 
Permanent  impacts  to  wetland  plant  communities  along  the  causeway  would  be  limited  to 
placement  of  piers  and  direct  shading.  Shading  could  potentially  result  in  some  alteration  of 
plant  community  makeup  under  the  causeway  and  a  reduction  in  primary  productivity.  The 
building  method  for  the  proposed  causeway  has  not  yet  been  determined,  but  construction  work 
mats  are  expected  to  be  used  within  a  50-ft-wide  easement  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Reductions

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


in  primary  productivity  due  to  causeway  development  should  be  minimal  overall,  considering  the 
large  area  of  adjacent  coastal  wetlands  within  the  project  vicinity. 

A  total  of  1 31  ac  of  wetlands  would  be  lost  as  a  result  of  building  activities  on  the  PSEG  Site 
and  vicinity.  This  represents  less  than  1  percent  of  the  25,534  ac  of  wetlands  available  in  the 
vicinity.  Most  of  these  wetlands  are  dominated  by  near  monocultures  of  the  common  reed 
( Phragmites  australis ),  a  non-native  aggressive  invasive  plant  species  that  significantly  impacts 
wetland  diversity  and  habitat  structure  with  resultant  significant  impacts  to  wildlife  habitat  quality 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  However,  wetlands  are  an  important  habitat  and  the  alteration  of  these 
wetlands  would  be  noticeable.  Further  discussion  of  wetland  habitats  can  be  found  in 
Section  4. 3. 1.2,  which  discusses  important  species  and  habitats. 

Barren  Land 


About  19  ac  of  barren  land  would  be  disturbed  on  the  site  by  construction  and  preconstruction 
activities.  This  includes  permanent  impacts  to  nearly  all  of  the  1 5  ac  of  altered  lands  and  4  ac  of 
disturbed  wetlands  (modified).  Temporary  impacts  to  barren  land  on  the  site  include  less  than 
1  acofthe  available  disturbed  wetlands  (modified)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Offsite  barren  land  disturbances  in  the  vicinity  include  about  13  ac  of  temporary  impacts  in  the 
adjacent  offsite  areas.  No  barren  land  disturbances  are  expected  for  the  building  activities 
associated  with  the  proposed  causeway  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Disturbances  to  barren  lands  represent  about  3  percent  of  the  available  651  ac  of  barren  land  in 
the  vicinity  and  less  than  1  percent  of  the  54,142  ac  of  barren  lands  available  in  the  region 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Construction  and  preconstruction  impacts  on  barren  land  would  not 
noticeably  affect  barren  land  habitats  in  the  vicinity. 

Managed  Wetlands 

The  applicant  proposes  to  temporarily  disturb  2.7  ac  or  71  percent  of  the  available  managed 
wetlands  on  the  PSEG  Site.  There  would  be  no  permanent  impacts  to  managed  wetlands,  and 
there  are  no  managed  wetlands  available  in  offsite  areas  or  along  the  proposed  causeway  route 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  This  disturbance  would  not  noticeably  affect  managed  wetlands  in  the 
vicinity. 

Agricultural  Land 

Agricultural  lands  that  would  be  potentially  impacted  by  building  activities  include  near  offsite 
areas  along  the  proposed  causeway  route.  These  agricultural  land-cover  types  are  located  at 
the  north  end  of  the  proposed  causeway  in  Elsinboro  Township.  These  plant  communities 
consist  of  cultivated  crops  and  adventitious  weedy  species.  The  proposed  causeway  would 
permanently  disturb  12.4  ac  and  temporarily  disturb  0.2  ac  of  agricultural  land  in  the  vicinity. 

No  permanent  or  temporary  impacts  to  agricultural  lands  would  result  from  onsite  building 
activities  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  affected  agricultural  lands  represent  less  than  1  percent  of 
agricultural  lands  available  in  the  vicinity  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  These  impacts  would  not 
noticeably  affect  the  available  agricultural  habitats  in  the  vicinity.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Impacts  to  Wildlife 
Habitat  Loss  Impacts 

Loss  of  habitat  as  a  result  of  building  activities  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  impact  terrestrial  wildlife 
species  currently  inhabiting  the  site.  Some  direct  loss  of  less  mobile  species  and  displacement 
of  more  mobile  species  to  adjacent  areas  would  be  expected.  Less  mobile  species  may  include 
small  rodents,  amphibians,  and  turtles.  It  is  expected  that  larger  species  (e.g.,  raccoons, 
skunks,  groundhogs,  foxes,  coyotes,  and  deer)  and  other  more  mobile  species  (e.g.,  birds) 
would  be  capable  of  easily  moving  off  the  site.  However,  displacement  of  species  into 
surrounding  areas  would  likely  cause  increased  competition  for  resources  (i.e. ,  food,  cover,  and 
nesting  sites)  in  those  areas,  resulting  in  some  negative  overall  impacts  to  species  populations 
where  habitat  carrying  capacity  is  exceeded.  Due  to  the  extensive  permanent  and  temporary 
impacts  to  onsite  wetland  resources,  wildlife  species  that  are  dependent  on  this  habitat  for 
foraging,  cover,  and  reproduction  have  the  potential  to  be  adversely  affected.  However,  ample 
available  habitat  of  similar  structure  and  function  exists  in  the  vicinity  and  region. 

The  proposed  causeway  would  be  built  on  piers,  thereby  preserving  wildlife  travel  corridors.  By 
allowing  wildlife  travel  below  the  causeway,  this  elevated  design  would  minimize  the  possibility 
for  wildlife-vehicle  collisions  and  wildlife  mortality  compared  with  conventional  roadways  built  on 
embankments.  Wildlife  species  potentially  impacted  by  building  activities  are  generally  common 
in  the  region,  as  described  in  Section  2.4.1 .  The  surrounding  area  includes  large  tracts  of  land 
that  would  be  suitable  for  most  displaced  species,  with  competition  from  existing  resident 
species  in  those  areas  being  the  greatest  challenge  for  displaced  species  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

Potential  Noise  and  Fugitive  Dust  Impacts 

Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  in  the  vicinity  that  produce 
noise  and  fugitive  dust  would  likely  displace  wildlife  into  habitat  surrounding  the  work  areas. 

The  peak  noise  level  associated  with  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  would  be 
102  dBA  50  ft  away  from  work  areas,  attenuated  to  58  dBA  1,500  ft  away  (Table  3-3). 

Behavioral  impacts  attributed  to  noise  could  decrease  chances  for  wildlife  survival  and 
successful  reproduction.  Impacts  to  wildlife  can  range  from  nonexistent  to  serious  depending 
on  the  species  and  the  situation  (Larkin  1996-TN772).  In  past  studies  of  frequent  noise  events 
exceeding  80  dBA,  waterfowl  activities  demonstrated  only  minimal  responses  to  individual 
events  and  no  noticeable  disruptions  of  typical  behavior  patterns,  indicating  that  avian  species 
quickly  accommodate  to  the  noise  events  (Fleming  et  al.  2001-TN2419).  It  is  anticipated  that 
general  noise  levels  from  preconstruction  and  construction  would  dissipate  to  ambient  levels 
within  a  short  distance,  which  is  well  below  that  which  would  normally  cause  a  response  in 
wildlife  (NRC  2013-TN2654). 

PSEG  proposes  to  suppress  fugitive  dust  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  offsite  preconstruction  and 
construction  areas  by  using  water  from  local  stormwater  retention  ponds.  The  impact  of  fugitive 
dust  to  wildlife  species  would  be  negligible.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Potential  for  Collisions  with  Human-Made  Structures 


Avian  and  bat  collisions  with  human-made  structures  can  be  attributed  to  numerous  factors 
related  to  species  characteristics  such  as  flight  behavior,  age,  habitat  use,  and  seasonal  and 
diurnal  habitats  and  environmental  characteristics  such  as  weather,  topography,  land  use,  and 
orientation  of  the  structures.  This  is  a  particular  concern  in  the  area  of  the  PSEG  Site  because 
it  is  in  the  Atlantic  Flyway,  a  major  bird  migration  route.  Additionally,  bat  hibernacula  (shelters 
occupied  by  dormant  bats)  are  known  to  occur  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  Bird  and  bat 
collisions  with  construction  equipment,  such  as  cranes  or  new  structures,  have  the  potential 
to  occur  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Studies  of  avian  and  bat  collisions  with  elevated  construction 
equipment  are  lacking.  However,  surveys  conducted  in  the  vicinity  of  other  human-made 
structures  such  as  NDCTs  indicate  that  avian  mortalities  as  a  result  of  collisions  could  occur. 

The  findings  of  NUREG-1437,  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  License  Renewal  of 
Nuclear  Plants  (NRC  2013-TN2654),  demonstrated  that  mortalities  as  a  result  of  avian  collisions 
with  existing  structures  at  nuclear  power  plants  are  minor  and  typically  occur  with  structures 
more  than  300-ft  tall.  In  addition,  a  study  of  bat  collisions  with  wind  turbine  towers  indicated  that 
only  a  small  fraction  of  bats  collide  with  towers  and  the  number  was  not  sufficient  to  alter 
populations  (Erickson  et  al.  2002-TN771).  The  tallest  structure  on  the  PSEG  Site  is  the  NDCT 
associated  with  HCGS  (512  ft)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  During  a  year-long  study  from  1985  to 
1986,  PSEG  counted  a  total  of  30  avian  mortalities  with  no  Federal-  or  State-listed  endangered 
or  threatened  species  noted  (PSEG  1987-TN2893).  Therefore,  the  impacts  of  such  collisions 
during  preconstruction  and  construction  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  expected  to  be  negligible. 

Potential  Impacts  of  Artificial  Light 

Nighttime  artificial  lighting  has  the  potential  to  impact  wildlife  during  preconstruction  and 
construction  activities.  Frogs,  for  example,  have  been  found  to  inhibit  their  mating  calls  when 
exposed  to  excessive  light  at  night.  The  feeding  behavior  of  some  bat  species  may  also  be 
affected  by  artificial  lighting  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  In  addition,  artificial  lighting  could  create  or 
magnify  the  incidence  of  avian  collisions  if  tall  cranes  are  illuminated  for  nighttime  work. 
According  to  Evans  Ogden  (1996-TN3284),  the  largest  proportion  of  migrating  birds  affected  by 
human-built  structures  is  composed  of  songbirds.  This  is  apparently  because  they  typically 
migrate  at  night,  exhibit  low  flight  altitudes,  and  have  a  tendency  to  be  trapped  and  disoriented 
by  artificial  light.  This  makes  them  vulnerable  to  collisions  with  obstructions.  Wildlife  species  on 
the  PSEG  Site  and  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  are  acclimated  to  the  artificial  lighting  associated  with  the 
operating  nuclear  power  plants  and  support  structures.  As  previously  mentioned,  avian 
collisions  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  negligible  and  no  bat  species  mortalities  have  been  noted. 
Therefore,  artificial  light  impacts  to  wildlife  species  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

Summary  of  Impacts  to  Terrestrial  Habitats  and  Wildlife 

The  construction  and  preconstruction  impacts  on  terrestrial  habitats  and  wildlife  of  building  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  projected  to  be  minimal.  This  does  not  include 
impacts  to  important  species  and  important  wetlands,  wildlife  sanctuaries,  refuges,  and 
preserves.  Important  species  and  important  wetlands,  wildlife  sanctuaries,  refuges,  and 
preserves  are  discussed  further  in  Section  4.3.1 .2.  Habitat  available  for  terrestrial  wildlife  that 
currently  exists  at  the  PSEG  Site  where  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  would  occur

is  more  common  elsewhere  in  the  vicinity.  Avian  collisions  with  building  equipment  and 
temporary  facilities  would  be  minimal.  Noise  impacts  would  be  localized  and  attenuate  with 
distance.  Artificial  lighting  and  fugitive  dust  would  not  be  expected  to  disrupt  the  behaviors  of 
terrestrial  wildlife  beyond  the  building  area.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that 
preconstruction  and  construction  impacts  to  terrestrial  habitats  and  wildlife  would  be  negligible. 

4.3. 1.2  Important  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Species  and  Habitats 

Important  Species  -  PS  EG  Site  and  Vicinity 

This  section  describes  the  potential  impacts  on  important  species  from  construction  and 
preconstruction  activities  associated  with  building  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Important  species 
considered  in  this  section  include  Federally  proposed,  threatened,  or  endangered  terrestrial 
species;  State-listed  species;  and  other  ecologically  important  species.  As  part  of  the  NRC’s 
responsibilities  under  Section  7  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act  of  1 973  (16  USC  1531  et  seq.  - 
TN 1010),  the  NRC  will  prepare  a  biological  assessment  (BA)  before  issuance  of  the  final  EIS 
that  evaluates  potential  impacts  of  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  on  Federally  listed 
(or  proposed),  threatened,  or  endangered  aquatic  and  terrestrial  species  (Appendix  F). 

Section  2.4.1  describes  the  important  terrestrial  species  and  habitats  located  within  the  PSEG 
Site  and  vicinity.  Impacts  to  terrestrial  species  are  discussed  in  greater  detail  below. 

Terrestrial  Species  of  Recreational  or  Commercial  Value 

Northern  river  otters  ( Lontra  canadensis)  were  observed  in  the  Delaware  River  at  the  PSEG  Site 
during  the  2009  to  2010  field  survey.  They  are  an  economically  important  furbearer  species 
because  of  their  thick  and  very  durable  fur.  The  species  is  generally  most  abundant  in  food-rich 
coastal  areas  such  as  the  lower  portions  of  streams,  rivers,  and  estuaries  (Chapman  and 
Feldhamer  1982-TN3274).  Although  some  temporary  displacement  of  river  otters  may  occur 
during  preconstruction  or  construction  at  the  PSEG  Site,  suitable  habitat  would  remain  abundant 
in  the  Delaware  River,  Alloway  Creek,  Hope  Creek,  and  various  unnamed  tidal  creeks  in  the 
vicinity. 

Muskrats  ( Ondatra  zibethicus )  generally  prefer  coastal  marshes  and  marshy  areas  around 
lakes,  sloughs,  streams,  and  rivers.  However,  they  are  very  adaptable  and  can  also  be  found  in 
a  wide  range  of  habitats,  including  strip-mined  ponds,  ditches,  canals,  and  pits.  They  are 
considered  to  be  the  most  valuable  fur  animal  in  North  America  (Chapman  and 
Feldhamer  1982-TN3274).  Muskrats  are  abundant  in  the  coastal  and  freshwater  wetlands 
surrounding  the  PSEG  Site  and  were  observed  during  the  2009  to  2010  field  survey.  Building  at 
the  PSEG  Site  would  permanently  impact  a  little  less  than  127  ac  of  potential  muskrat  habitat  on 
the  site  and  a  little  more  than  25  ac  off  the  site.  This  would  result  in  the  displacement  of  some 
animals,  which  could  result  in  increased  competition  for  resources  in  surrounding  areas. 
Although  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  the  associated  causeway  would  result  in  loss  of  some 
habitat  for  this  species,  more  than  25,000  ac  of  wetlands  would  remain  in  surrounding  areas 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

White-tailed  deer  ( Odocoiieus  virginianus)  are  an  important  game  species  and  have  significant 
economic  value,  offering  major  recreational  hunting  opportunities.  White-tailed  deer  are  found

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


throughout  New  Jersey  and  are  absent  only  from  the  most  urbanized  areas.  Deer  hunters  in 
New  Jersey  spend  more  than  $100  million  a  year,  benefiting  a  wide  variety  of  businesses. 

White-tailed  deer  are  abundant  in  the  upland  agricultural  areas  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site 
and  were  commonly  observed  during  the  2009  to  2010  ecological  field  studies.  On  the  site, 
white-tailed  deer  were  occasionally  observed  in  the  upland  old  field  habitat  east  of  HCGS  and 
SGS  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Building  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  permanently  impact  almost  9  ac 
and  temporarily  impact  almost  100  ac  of  potential  white-tailed  deer  habitat  on  the  site  in 
undeveloped  upland  ROWs  and  forest/old  field  land-cover  types.  Impacts  to  potential 
white-tailed  deer  habitat  within  the  proposed  causeway  (agriculture,  forest/old  field,  upland 
ROWs  undeveloped,  agricultural  wetlands,  and  former  agricultural  wetlands)  include  almost 
18  ac  of  permanent  impacts  and  0.3  ac  of  temporary  impacts.  Portions  of  the  impacted  area  are 
located  near  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS  facilities,  where  buildings,  pavement,  and  the  noise  of 
operations  result  in  marginal  or  unsuitable  habitat  conditions  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  may  also  temporarily  increase  the  potential  for 
white-tailed  deer  mortality  due  to  vehicle  collisions  associated  with  displacement  and  movement 
of  deer  toward  upland  habitat  to  the  east  of  the  site.  More  than  16,000  ac  of  agricultural  habitat 
and  more  than  2,500  ac  of  forest/old  field  habitat  would  remain  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Displacement  of  animals  could  result  in  increased  competition  for 
resources  in  surrounding  areas. 

The  northern  pintail  ( Anas  acuta),  green-winged  teal  ( Anas  crecca ),  mallard  ( Anas 
platyrhynchos),  American  black  duck  ( Anas  rubripes),  ring-necked  duck  ( Anas  collaris),  greater 
scaup  ( Aythya  marila),  bufflehead  ( Bucephala  alboela),  hooded  merganser  ( Lophodytes 
cucullatus),  common  merganser  ( Mergus  merganser),  and  red-breasted  merganser  ( Mergus 
serrator)  ducks;  Canada  goose  ( Branta  canadensis)',  and  snow  goose  ( Chen  caerulescens) 
are  all  waterfowl  that  have  been  identified  as  important  species  at  or  near  the  PSEG  Site 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  These  12  species  of  waterfowl,  plus  the  American  coot  ( Fulica 
americana),  are  considered  important  species  based  on  their  recreational  value  as  game 
species  that  are  hunted  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Although  protected  by  the  Migratory 
Bird  Treaty  Act  (16  USC  703  et  seq.  -TN3331),  these  species  are  commonly  harvested  during 
yearly  hunting  seasons. 

The  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity  contains  relatively  abundant  waterfowl  habitat.  However,  the 
invasion  of  the  exotic  Phragmites  australis  has  transformed  habitat  that  was  a  historically 
diverse  marsh  ecosystem  into  a  habitat  of  limited  structure  and  function,  with  altered  nutrient 
cycles  and  hydrological  regimes.  Of  specific  concern  are  negative  impacts  to  habitat  quality  and 
diversity  for  waterfowl.  Dense,  monotypic  stands  of  Phragmites  provide  only  marginal  habitat 
for  resident,  migratory,  and  wintering  species  of  waterfowl.  Although  waterfowl  may 
occasionally  nest  in  this  habitat,  most  are  migratory,  using  the  area  as  a  stopping  point  or 
wintering  area  along  the  Atlantic  Flyway.  These  birds  primarily  use  open  water  areas  present 
on  the  PSEG  Site,  including  the  CDF/disposal  basins  and  tidal  creeks.  Preconstruction-  and 
construction-related  activities  would  impact  90  ac  of  unmapped  coastal-CDF/disposal  basin 
wetlands.  These  basins  are  mostly  surrounded  by  nearly  impenetrable  monotypic  stands  of 
Phragmites  and  are  generally  shallow,  supporting  only  minimal  aquatic  vegetation  and  benthic 
macroinvertebrate  communities.  Limited  habitat  structure  and  plant  species  diversity  in  these 


NUREG-2168

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


areas  provide  very  little  foraging  opportunity  for  waterfowl,  and  they  are  primarily  used  as 
resting  areas.  Building  activities  may  result  in  displacement  of  waterfowl;  however,  tidal  creeks 
and  more  than  25,000  ac  of  wetland  habitat  would  remain  abundant  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG 
Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  wild  turkey  ( Meleagris  gallopavo)  is  an  important  game  bird  species  that  has  been  recorded 
on  and  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Wild  turkeys  were  observed  during  the  2009  to  2010 
field  survey.  A  total  of  8.7  ac  of  suitable  turkey  habitat  (i.e. ,  deciduous  brush/shrubland,  old 
field,  and  upland  ROWs  undeveloped)  would  be  permanently  converted  to  developed  land- 
cover  types  on  the  PSEG  Site  as  a  result  of  preconstruction  and  construction  activities.  A  total 
of  99.9  ac  of  this  habitat  would  be  temporarily  eliminated.  Also,  a  total  of  1 6.8  ac  of  turkey 
habitat  (i.e.,  cropland,  pastureland,  or  other  agriculture;  forest/old  field;  and  upland  ROWs 
undeveloped)  would  be  permanently  impacted  by  building  the  proposed  causeway.  Wild 
turkeys  are  mobile  birds  capable  of  dispersing  to  adjacent  areas  with  suitable  habitat.  More 
than  1 6,000  ac  of  agricultural  land  and  more  than  2,500  ac  of  forest/old  field  would  remain 
available  to  turkeys  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  after  building  activities  were  completed 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Increased  competition  for  limited  resources  and  increased  competition 
for  females  by  males  would  probably  be  the  two  largest  impacts.  However,  a  fairly  limited 
amount  of  habitat  would  be  permanently  impacted  in  comparison  to  vast  areas  of  habitat  in  the 
immediate  vicinity. 

Federally  or  State-Listed  Terrestrial  Species 

Reptiles  and  Amphibians.  The  bog  turtle  ( Glyptemys  muhlenbergii)  is  listed  as  threatened 
Federally  and  State-listed  as  endangered  by  both  New  Jersey  and  Delaware.  This  species  was 
recorded  historically  for  Artificial  Island  and  the  vicinity  during  a  study  conducted  between  1972 
and  1978.  There  were  no  records  for  this  species  in  the  latest  surveys  conducted  by  PSEG  in 
2009  to  2010  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Although  the  most  recent  distribution  for  bog  turtles 
includes  Salem  County,  the  PSEG  Site  does  not  currently  contain  suitable  habitat  for  this 
species.  Bog  turtles  require  large  contiguous  areas  of  land  for  dispersal,  and  intense  land  uses 
such  as  those  found  on  the  PSEG  Site  are  not  favorable  to  this  species.  Furthermore, 
monocultures  of  invasive  species  such  as  Phragmites  are  not  conducive  to  bog  turtle  presence. 
Therefore,  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  be  expected  to 
impact  this  species. 

The  eastern  tiger  salamander  ( Ambystoma  tigrinum  tigrinum)  is  listed  as  endangered  by  New 
Jersey.  This  species  was  recorded  historically  during  the  Artificial  Island  study  from  1972  to 
1978.  There  were  no  records  for  this  species  in  the  latest  surveys  conducted  by  PSEG  from 
2009  to  2010  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Although  tiger  salamanders  will  use  human-made  ponds, 
it  is  not  believed  that  the  PSEG  Site  contains  sufficient  habitat  to  fulfill  all  life  requirements  to 
sustain  this  species.  Life  requirements  include  both  upland  and  wetland  habitat  that  contain 
ponds  suitable  for  breeding,  forested  areas,  and  soil  types  that  allow  burrowing  (loamy  sand  and 
sandy  loams  are  preferred).  Vegetation  around  the  ponds  used  by  this  species  normally 
includes  sedges  and  sphagnum  moss,  and  sufficient  aquatic  vegetation  is  needed  in  the  pond 
itself  for  cover.  The  altered  habitat  present  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  appear  to  be  conducive 
to  supporting  tiger  salamander  populations.  In  addition,  surveys  of  this  species  conducted  in 
1995  revealed  that  the  tiger  salamander  occurred  at  only  a  limited  number  of  sites  in  Atlantic

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


and  Cumberland  Counties  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Therefore,  building  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  would  not  be  expected  to  impact  this  species. 

Birds.  The  rufa  red  knot  ( Calidris  canutus  rufa)  is  Federally  listed  as  threatened,  and  State- 
listed  as  endangered  for  both  New  Jersey  and  Delaware.  This  species  has  not  been  previously 
recorded  on  the  PSEG  Site  or  vicinity  and  was  not  noted  in  field  surveys  conducted  from  2009 
to  2010  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  nearest  known  occurrence  of  the  rufa  red  knot  is  in 
adjacent  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey,  and  Kent  County,  Delaware  (79  FR  73705-TN4267). 
Additionally,  the  PSEG  Site  does  not  contain  suitable  habitat  or  forage  to  support  this  species. 
Therefore,  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  be  expected  to 
impact  the  rufa  red  knot. 

The  eight  birds  of  prey  identified  as  important  species  include  the  Cooper’s  hawk  ( Accipiter 
cooperii),  northern  goshawk  (Accipiter gentilis),  red-shouldered  hawk  (Buteo  lineatus),  northern 
harrier  ( Circus  cyaneus),  bald  eagle  ( Haliaeetus  leucocephalus),  osprey  ( Pandion  haliaetus), 
American  kestrel  ( Falco  sparverius)  and  peregrine  falcon  ( Falco  peregrinus).  The  Cooper’s 
hawk  is  listed  as  a  species  of  special  concern  in  New  Jersey.  Cooper’s  hawks  prefer  large 
tracts  of  forested  land,  where  they  nest  in  large  mature  trees.  One  was  observed  in  a  small  tree 
on  the  site  in  the  fall  of  2009.  Preferred  habitat  for  this  species  is  not  present  on  the  site,  and 
Cooper’s  hawks  are  more  likely  residents  of  forested  habitat  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site. 

Use  of  habitat  at  the  PSEG  Site  by  this  species  is  most  likely  of  a  transient  nature  during 
foraging.  Year-round,  migrating  and  wintering  birds  would  all  be  expected  to  use  the  site  in  this 
manner.  Preconstruction-  and  construction-related  impacts  to  Cooper’s  hawks  are  expected  to 
be  minimal. 

Northern  goshawks,  listed  as  endangered  for  the  breeding  population  and  as  a  species  of 
special  concern  for  the  nonbreeding  population  in  New  Jersey,  have  been  reported  in  the 
project  vicinity  during  recent  (2008  to  2009)  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Counts  for 
Salem  County  (Audubon  2013-TN2414).  This  species  breeds  in  mature  forests,  and  the  PSEG 
Site  contains  no  potential  breeding  habitat.  However,  goshawks  frequent  a  wider  variety  of 
habitats  outside  the  breeding  season  during  foraging.  These  habitats  include  scrubby  areas 
and  tree  lines  along  marshes  or  open  fields.  Potential  foraging  habitat  in  the  form  of  forest/old 
fields  and  wetlands  would  be  impacted  by  building  at  the  PSEG  Site.  However,  more  than 
27,000  ac  of  such  habitat  are  present  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site  (Audubon  2013-TN2414). 
Therefore,  impacts  to  potential  foraging  habitat  for  this  species  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

Although  the  red-shouldered  hawk,  a  New  Jersey-listed  endangered  species,  has  been 
identified  in  recent  years  near  the  PSEG  Site  during  the  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas 
Bird  Counts  (Audubon  2013-TN2414),  as  discussed  in  Section  2.4.1,  no  red-shouldered  hawks 
were  observed  on  the  site  during  the  2009  to  2010  field  survey  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Preferred  habitat,  deciduous  and  mixed  forest  communities  adjacent  to  water,  is  absent  on  the 
site  but  available  in  the  vicinity.  Only  transient  use  of  the  site  would  be  expected  for  this 
species.  Therefore,  preconstruction-  and  construction-related  impacts  to  red-shouldered  hawks 
are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

The  northern  harrier,  a  State-listed  endangered  species  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware,  has  been 
commonly  observed  foraging  in  the  coastal  wetlands  on  and  in  proximity  to  the  site.  Nests  were

not  observed  on  the  site  during  the  2009  to  2010  field  survey;  however,  nesting  habitat  in  the 
coastal  marsh  is  present  on  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity.  Onsite  habitat  potentially  used  by  the 
northern  harrier  that  could  be  impacted  by  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  includes 
26.1  ac  of  Phr ag  mites  -dominated  old  field,  63.4  ac  of  Phragmites-d  o  m  i  n  a  ted  coastal  wetlands, 
68.3  ac  of  Phragmites-dominaied  interior  wetlands,  56.9  ac  of  old  field,  and  0.1  ac  of  saline 
marsh.  Northern  harrier  habitat  within  the  proposed  causeway  that  could  be  permanently 
impacted  includes  1 1 .3  ac  of  agricultural  lands,  3.4  ac  of  old  field  habitats,  and  25.1  ac  of 
wetlands.  The  vast  majority  of  impacts  would  be  incurred  in  areas  consisting  of  near 
monocultures  of  the  invasive  reed  Phragmites  australis ,  which  generally  offers  habitat  of  limited 
structure  and  function  because  it  forms  dense,  impenetrable  stands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
However,  there  are  records  of  harriers  nesting  in  Phragmites- dominated  habitats  (NJDEP  2014- 
TN3255).  The  carrying  capacity  of  the  areas  for  nesting  harriers  could  be  impacted,  thereby 
decreasing  the  number  of  pairs  that  could  nest  in  the  area.  However,  abundant  higher  quality 
foraging  and  nesting  habitat  for  this  species  would  remain  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site. 
Because  impacts  incurred  would  be  to  habitat  of  limited  structure  and  function  and  ample 
high-quality  northern  harrier  habitat  would  remain,  impacts  to  the  northern  harrier  are  expected 
to  be  minimal. 

Due  to  its  successful  recovery,  the  bald  eagle  is  no  longer  a  Federally  listed  species  by  the  U.S. 
Fish  and  Wildlife  Service.  The  bald  eagle  was  identified  as  important  because  of  its  status  as  a 
Federally  protected  species  (16  USC  703  et  seq.  -TN3331;  Bald  and  Golden  Eagle  Protection 
Act,  16  USC  668  et  seq.  -TN1447)  and  as  a  State-listed  endangered  species  for  both  New 
Jersey  and  Delaware.  Although  bald  eagles  were  occasionally  observed  during  the  2009  to 
2010  onsite  field  survey,  there  are  no  known  bald  eagle  nests  or  suitable  roosting  habitat  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  absence  of  large  trees  or  suitable  structures  that  could 
support  nesting  activities  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Therefore,  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
and  causeway  are  not  anticipated  to  impact  bald  eagle  nesting,  foraging,  or  roosting  habitat,  so 
impacts  to  the  bald  eagle  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

Osprey,  a  New  Jersey  State-listed  threatened  species,  were  occasionally  observed  both  on  and 
in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  during  the  2009  to  2010  field  survey.  Active  osprey  nests  were 
observed  on  transmission  towers  along  the  current  access  road,  on  the  transmission  towers  that 
run  from  the  plant  north  toward  Money  Island  Road,  and  on  human-made  nesting  platforms 
constructed  by  PSEG  along  Alloway  Creek.  Natural  osprey  nesting  sites  such  as  large  trees 
are  not  present  on  the  site  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Impacts  to  osprey,  if  any,  would  be 
considered  minor  because  nesting  platforms  are  not  expected  to  be  impacted  by 
preconstruction  or  construction.  Furthermore,  food  and  foraging  habitat  (i.e.,  in  the  Delaware 
River)  would  remain  abundant  during  and  after  development  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant. 
Consequently,  impacts  on  osprey  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

American  kestrels,  State-listed  as  threatened  in  New  Jersey,  have  been  reported  in  the  PSEG 
Site  vicinity  by  the  USGS  North  American  Breeding  Bird  Survey  (BBS)  and  during  recent 
Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Counts  for  Salem  County  (PSEG  2015-TN4280; 
Audubon  2013-TN2414).  This  species  was  also  recorded  during  past  work  conducted  in  the 
Alloway  Creek  Watershed  (PSEG  2004-TN2897).  This  is  a  species  that  prefers  open  country. 
Building  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  permanently  disturb  less  than  3  ac  and  temporarily  disturb  a 
little  more  than  54  ac  of  old  field  habitat  that  could  serve  as  potential  habitat.  In  addition,

permanent  loss  of  agricultural  lands  due  to  building  the  causeway  would  be  11.3  ac.  However, 
there  are  more  than  2,500  ac  of  forest/old  field  habitat  and  more  than  16,000  ac  of  cropland- 
pastureland  and  other  agriculture  habitat  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site.  In  addition,  this  would  be 
expected  to  be  higher  quality  habitat  and  more  conducive  habitat  for  kestrels  than  what  currently 
exists  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Consequently,  impacts  of  preconstruction  and  construction  on 
kestrels  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

Peregrine  falcons,  State-listed  as  endangered  for  the  breeding  population  and  a  species  of 
special  concern  for  the  nonbreeding  population  in  New  Jersey,  have  been  reported  in  the  PSEG 
Site  vicinity  during  recent  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Counts  for  Salem  County 
(Audubon  2013-TN2414).  There  are  no  records  for  nesting  peregrine  falcons  in  Salem  County. 
Any  expected  use  of  the  PSEG  Site  by  peregrines  would  be  for  foraging,  which  would  most 
likely  occur  in  the  winter.  This  species  favors  open  areas  for  hunting,  frequently  hunting  over 
marshes,  beaches,  and  open  water.  Although  there  would  be  some  loss  of  wetlands  as  a  result 
of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  (108  ac  permanently,  31 .8  ac  temporarily)  and  the 
causeway  (23  ac  permanently,  19.6  ac  temporarily),  more  than  25,000  ac  of  wetlands  remain  in 
the  vicinity  of  the  site.  Therefore,  impacts  to  any  potential  foraging  habitat  for  this  species  are 
expected  to  be  minimal. 

A  number  of  wading  birds  have  been  documented  on  and/or  adjacent  to  the  PSEG  Site  during 
past  surveys  (Table  2-8).  Several  of  these  species  have  listed  status  in  New  Jersey  and/or 
Delaware.  These  species  include  several  State-designated  species  of  concern,  including  the 
great  blue  heron  ( Ardea  herodias),  little  blue  heron  ( Egretta  caerulea),  snowy  egret  ( Egretta 
thula),  and  glossy  ibis  ( Plegadis  falcinellus).  State-listed  endangered  and  threatened  species 
include  both  black-crowned  night-heron  (Nycticorax  nycticorax)  and  cattle  egret  ( Bubulcus  ibis). 
An  additional  State-listed  species,  the  pied-billed  grebe  {Podilymbus  podiceps),  has  been 
observed  in  low  numbers  during  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Counts  in  Salem 
County.  Common  terns  ( Sterna  hirundo),  a  State-designated  species  of  concern,  have  also 
been  recorded  at  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity.  Spotted  sandpipers  ( Actitis  macularius),  a  New 
Jersey  State-designated  species  of  concern,  may  also  frequent  such  areas.  There  are  no 
known  heron/egret  rookeries  or  tern  colonies  on  the  PSEG  Site.  However,  the  PSEG  Site  does 
contain  potential  foraging  habitat  that  would  be  permanently  impacted  by  building  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant.  This  includes  40  ac  of  artificial  lakes  (mainly  in  the  northeastern  portion  of  the  site) 
and  3  ac  of  tidal  rivers,  inland  bays,  and  other  tidal  waters  (Table  4-1 ).  However,  more  than 
26,000  ac  of  tidal  rivers,  inland  bays,  and  other  tidal  waters  would  remain  in  the  vicinity  of  the 
site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Therefore,  impacts  on  wading  birds  and  terns  are  expected  to  be 
minimal. 

A  number  of  New  Jersey  and/or  Delaware  State-listed  bird  species  that  typically  frequent  old 
fields  and  other  open  habitats  have  been  recorded  on  or  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  These 
include  State-designated  species  of  concern  including  brown  thrasher  ( Toxostoma  rufum), 
eastern  meadowlark  (Sturnella  magna ),  and  yellow-breasted  chat  ( Icteria  virens ).  Additionally, 
State-listed  endangered  and  threatened  species  such  as  horned  lark  ( Eremophiia  alpestris), 
bobolink  ( Dolichonyx  oryzivorus),  grasshopper  sparrow  ( Ammodramus  savannarum)  and 
savannah  sparrow  ( Passerculus  sandwichensis)  are  known  to  occur  in  these  habitats.  Building 
on  the  PSEG  Site  would  permanently  disturb  less  than  3  ac  and  temporarily  disturb  a  little  more 
than  54  ac  of  old  field  habitat  (Table  4-1 ).  However,  there  are  more  than  2,500  ac  of  forest/old

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


field  habitat  and  more  than  16,000  ac  of  cropland,  pastureland,  and  other  agriculture  habitat  in 
the  vicinity  of  the  site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  In  addition,  this  would  be  expected  to  be  higher 
quality  habitat  than  what  currently  exists  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  impacts  to  these  species 
are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

The  red-headed  woodpecker  ( Melanerpes  erythrocephalus)  breeding  and  nonbreeding 
populations  are  listed  by  New  Jersey  as  threatened.  No  red-headed  woodpeckers  were 
observed  during  the  2009  to  2010  field  survey,  nor  have  they  been  reported  in  USGS  BBS  or 
the  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Count.  In  addition,  the  site  and  vicinity  lack 
suitable  habitat  for  this  species  (i.e.,  open  woods,  deciduous  forests,  forest  edges,  river 
bottoms,  orchards,  grasslands  with  scattered  trees  and  clearings,  dead  or  dying  trees 
[Section  2.4.1]).  Therefore,  it  is  not  expected  that  there  would  be  any  preconstruction-  or 
construction-related  impacts  to  this  species. 

The  northern  parula  ( Parula  americana)  and  hooded  warbler  (Wilsonia  citrina),  New  Jersey 
State-designated  species  of  concern,  are  two  warbler  species  recorded  by  the  USGS  BBS  in 
the  vicinity  of  the  site.  The  site  does  not  contain  viable  nesting  habitat  for  either  species. 
However,  building  on  the  site  could  impact  potential  foraging  habitat  for  these  species. 

Bats.  Typical  hibernacula  and  maternity  roosting  habitat  suitable  for  the  northern  long-eared  bat 
(Myotis  septentrionalis )  does  not  exist  on  the  PSEG  Site,  and  the  bat  has  not  been  recorded  on 
the  site.  The  nearest  known  hibernacula  and  maternity  roost  are  in  northern  and  central  Salem 
County,  New  Jersey.  The  northern  long-eared  bat  is  not  expected  to  be  affected  by 
preconstruction  and  construction  activities  on  the  PSEG  Site. 

Plants.  Sensitive  joint-vetch  ( Aeschynomene  virginica )  is  a  Federally  threatened  plant  species 
that  is  known  to  occur  in  intertidal  zones  that  are  fresh  or  slightly  salty  in  areas  with  extensive 
marshes  subject  to  two  cycles  of  flooding  a  day.  It  prefers  sediments  that  are  bare  or  contain 
sparse  vegetation  along  river  banks  within  6  ft  of  the  low  water  mark.  It  can  also  occur  in  tidal 
marsh  interiors.  It  has  historically  occurred  within  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  but  has  not 
recently  been  recorded  on  the  site.  Suitable  habitat  is  not  expected  to  occur  on  the  PSEG  Site. 

Swamp  pink  ( Helonias  bullata)  and  small  whorled  pogonia  ( Isotria  medeoloides)  are  Federally 
listed  as  threatened.  Swamp  pink  is  an  obligate  wetland  species  that  occurs  in  palustrine 
forested  wetlands  with  canopy  closures  of  20  to  100  percent.  Although  it  is  believed  to  occur  in 
the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site,  suitable  habitat  does  not  exist.  Small  whorled  pogonia  grows  in 
upland,  mid-successional,  wooded  habitats,  usually  with  mixed  deciduous  or  mixed 
deciduous/coniferous  forest  with  canopy  trees  ranging  from  40  to  75  years  old.  Like  the  swamp 
pink,  suitable  habitat  on  the  PSEG  Site  is  not  available. 

Other  Important  Terrestrial  Species.  Green  tree  frogs  (Hyla  cinerea)  were  observed  on  the  site 
within  small  isolated  impounded  areas  within  the  PSEG  desilt  basin  during  the  2009  to  2010 
survey  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  A  survey  conducted  in  June  and  July  2012  also  detected  this 
species  in  the  same  general  onsite  location  and  numerous  offsite  locations  in  the  vicinity 
(AMEC  2012-TN3187).  This  was  a  new  species  record  for  New  Jersey,  although  its  range  does 
extend  throughout  the  Delmarva  Peninsula  to  the  south  and  west.  The  range  of  this  species 
appears  to  be  expanding,  and  it  is  not  listed  on  the  New  Jersey  special  concern  or  threatened

and  endangered  species  lists.  Based  on  the  overlay  of  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  shown  in 
Figure  4-1,  habitats  in  which  green  tree  frogs  were  observed  would  be  altered  or  eliminated  as 
part  of  preconstruction  and  construction  activities.  However,  based  on  the  prevalence  of 
records  for  the  green  tree  frog  at  numerous  offsite  locations  during  the  2012  survey 
(AMEC  2012-TN3187),  there  is  viable  habitat  for  this  species  in  a  number  of  areas  in  the  vicinity 
of  the  PSEG  Site. 

Summary  of  Impacts  on  Important  Terrestrial  Species  at  the  PSEG  Site 

The  construction  and  preconstruction  impacts  on  important  species  of  building  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  projected  to  be  minimal  with  no  additional  mitigation  needed. 
Habitat  available  for  important  species  that  currently  exist  at  the  PSEG  Site  where  construction 
and  preconstruction  activities  would  occur  is  more  common  elsewhere  in  the  vicinity.  Avian 
collisions  with  building  equipment  and  temporary  facilities  would  be  minimal.  Noise  impacts 
would  be  localized  and  attenuate  with  distance.  Artificial  lighting  and  fugitive  dust  would  not  be 
expected  to  disrupt  important  species  behaviors  beyond  the  building  area.  Therefore,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  preconstruction  and  construction  impacts  to  important  species 
would  be  negligible. 

Important  Habitats 

Wetlands 


Jurisdictional  wetlands  (i.e. ,  those  that  are  regulated  by  the  USACE  under  Section  10  of  the 
Rivers  and  Harbors  Appropriations  Act,  and  Section  404  of  the  CWA  [33  USC  1251  et  seq.  - 
TN662])  may  be  defined  and  identified  differently  than  wetlands  identified  as  part  of  the  NJDEP 
LULC  classification  system  and  are  subject  to  the  USACE  permitting  requirements.  Therefore, 
jurisdictional  wetlands  are  evaluated  separately  from  the  LULC  analysis.  Because  the  USACE 
uses  the  Cowardin  System  for  land-use  classification  of  wetlands  and  waters,  the  overall 
acreages  of  impacts  described  above  would  be  similar,  but  may  not  be  identical,  to  the  acreage 
calculations  for  the  USACE  values.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  habitat  condition  and 
extent  of  wetlands  may  vary  with  time,  especially  in  modified  or  disturbed  locations  (e.g.,  CDFs) 
where  dredge  materials  are  being  deposited.  The  USACE  has  prepared  and  approved 
jurisdictional  determination  for  the  project  site  (USACE  2014-TN3282).  The  following 
descriptions  of  impacts  are  based  on  the  jurisdictional  wetlands  determination. 

There  would  be  unavoidable  impacts  to  waters  of  the  United  States  and  State  waters  as  a  result 
of  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and 
related  facilities.  This  would  include  both  direct  and  indirect  impacts  to  wetland  resources  at  the 
PSEG  Site  and  along  the  proposed  causeway.  Direct  impacts  would  be  related  to  direct 
alteration  of  the  habitat  as  the  result  of  fill  placement,  shading,  and  other  preconstruction  and 
construction  activities.  There  would  also  be  the  potential  for  indirect  impacts  to  areas  outside 
the  wetlands.  These  indirect  impacts  might  include  pollutant  loading  (e.g.,  oil  and  grease)  from 
cars  traveling  along  the  proposed  causeway  and  erosion/sedimentation  caused  by  additional 
runoff  due  to  increases  in  impervious  surfaces  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Specific  site  use  areas  where  direct  impacts  to  wetlands  might  occur  include,  but  are  not  limited 
to,  the  power  block,  cooling  tower,  switchyard,  batch  plant,  heavy  haul  road,  parking,  intake 
structure,  and  temporary  laydown  areas,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  4-1.  Direct  impacts  are 
generally  associated  with  the  placement  of  fill  material  in  support  of  construction  activities.  As 
discussed  in  Section  4.3.1,  the  limits  of  the  site  use  areas  represent  a  bounded  configuration  of 
the  lands  potentially  affected  by  building  activities  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Onsite  building  activities  would  impact  a  total  of  63.4  ac  of  coastal  wetlands  and  122.5  ac  of 
unmapped  coastal  wetlands.  Of  the  122.5  ac  of  unmapped  coastal  wetlands  potentially 
impacted,  90  ac  are  situated  in  active  land  disposal  areas  (i.e.,  the  USACE  CDF  and  PSEG 
desilt  basin).  A  total  of  1 51 .2  ac  of  wetlands  are  in  proposed  onsite  permanent  use  areas,  and 
36.5  ac  are  in  onsite  and  adjacent  offsite  temporary  use  areas  (the  USACE  CDF).  The  impacts 
to  all  of  these  use  areas  are  considered  to  be  permanent,  and  mitigation  for  losses  would  occur 
in  other  areas  of  the  site  or  in  offsite  areas  (Section  4.3.1 .4)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

An  additional  39.6  ac  of  coastal  wetlands  and  1 .4  ac  of  unmapped  coastal/freshwater  wetlands 
off  the  site  would  be  impacted  by  building  the  proposed  causeway.  Offsite  impacts  associated 
with  the  causeway  would  be  minimized  through  the  use  of  an  elevated  road  and  bridge  design 
that  would  reduce  the  width  and  magnitude  of  impact  when  compared  to  building  on  fill.  Within 
a  50-ft-wide  corridor,  wetland  impacts  resulting  from  fill  would  be  limited  to  areas  directly 
affected  by  pier  placement.  Some  plant  community  alteration  is  expected  due  to  shading 
effects,  as  described  in  Section  4.3.1 .  Because  of  this,  the  50-ft-wide  corridor  was  assumed  to 
be  permanently  impacted.  It  was  also  assumed  that  construction  methods  would  include  the 
use  of  low-ground-pressure  equipment  and  work  mats  to  support  heavy  equipment  (e.g.,  pile 
drivers).  Work  mats  would  be  used  within  a  50-ft-wide  easement  and  removed  once  the 
causeway  is  completed  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Temporary  impacts  within  these  areas  would 
therefore  be  minimized,  with  limited  compaction  and  disturbance  to  wetland  soils  and 
substrates.  Therefore,  disturbance  is  anticipated  to  be  temporary  in  these  areas,  and  recovery 
following  the  building  phase  is  expected  to  be  rapid. 

Indirect  impacts  would  occur  within  adjacent  wetlands  and  surface  waters,  including  localized 
siltation  and  sedimentation.  Preconstruction-  and  construction-related  secondary  impacts  to  site 
wetlands  would  be  minimized  and  controlled  with  the  use  of  BMPs.  This  would  include  the  use 
of  silt  fences,  temporary  and  permanent  vegetative  stabilization,  mulching,  erosion-control 
blankets,  stormwater  detention  basins,  and  other  soil  erosion  and  sediment  control  practices,  as 
appropriate.  These  measures  would  reduce  the  risk  of  sediment  runoff  into  wetlands  adjoining 
the  site.  Grading  plans  would  also  be  used  to  control  site  runoff  from  developed  lands  and 
prevent  discharge  of  stormwater  into  adjacent  wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

In  total,  104.8  ac  of  coastal,  122.5  ac  of  unmapped  coastal,  and  1 .4  ac  of  freshwater  wetlands 
are  expected  to  be  impacted  by  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  the  proposed 
causeway.  Because  of  the  abundance  of  wetland  land-cover  types  within  the  vicinity 
(25,534  ac)  and  the  quality  of  the  impacted  resource  (i.e.,  the  dominance  of  Phragmites  and  the 
large  amount  of  onsite  acreage  represented  in  CDFs),  the  potential  impacts  to  this  cover  type 
are  expected  to  be  noticeable  and  may  warrant  mitigation  (additional  discussion  in 
Section  4. 3. 1.4  regarding  mitigation)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA  and  Abbotts  Meadow  WMA.  Portions  of  the  proposed  causeway  would 
traverse  sections  of  the  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA  and  Abbotts  Meadow  WMA.  About  1  ac  of 
these  WMAs  would  be  impacted.  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA  consists  of  9,500  acres  of  wildlife 
habitat  and  recreational  land,  and  Abbotts  Meadow  WMA  contains  1 ,000  acres  of  wildlife  habitat 
and  recreational  land.  The  impact  represents  less  than  1  percent  of  the  combined  available 
habitat  at  these  WMAs. 

Summary  of  Impacts  to  Important  Habitats 

Preconstruction-  and  construction-related  impacts  to  important  habitats  as  a  result  of  building  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  and  associated  support  structures  would  be  noticeable.  The  impacts 
to  about  229  ac  of  wetlands  would  be  noticeable,  but  not  destabilizing.  These  impacts  may 
warrant  mitigation,  as  prescribed  by  the  USACE.  Although  the  loss  of  about  1  ac  of  WMA  would 
not  be  noticeable,  it  would  have  a  localized  effect  on  species  dependent  on  the  resources. 

4. 3. 1.3  Terrestrial  Monitoring 

PSEG  has  not  proposed  terrestrial  monitoring  during  construction  or  preconstruction  activities 
associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  However,  PSEG  conducts  ecological  monitoring  as 
part  of  its  EEP  near  the  site  in  conjunction  with  its  NJPDES  permit  for  SGS.  These  ecological 
studies  include  vegetation  cover  and  geomorphology  monitoring  for  four  restoration  sites  and 
two  reference  sites.  Additionally,  the  USACE  could  require  PSEG  to  conduct  short-  and  long¬ 
term  monitoring  of  wetland  mitigation  activities  in  association  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
and  support  structures  as  part  of  compliance  with  the  USACE-issued  permits. 

4. 3. 1.4  Potential  Mitigation  Measures  for  Terrestrial  Impacts 

Mitigation  of  unavoidable  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  may  include  restoration  of 
habitats  disturbed  by  preconstruction  and  construction  activities,  creation  of  new  habitat  in 
previously  disturbed  areas,  and  enhancement  of  other  natural  habitat.  PSEG  has  indicated  that 
any  mitigation  plans  would  be  developed  in  consultation  with  the  applicable  Federal,  State,  and 
local  agencies.  Additionally,  PSEG-proposed  mitigation  would  be  done  both  on  the  site  and  off 
the  site  in  the  immediate  vicinity  to  the  extent  practicable  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG’s 
proposed  mitigation  measures  are  described  in  the  following  sections  for  both  upland  areas  and 
wetlands. 

Upland  Terrestrial  Habitats 

The  mitigation  of  temporary  impacts  to  terrestrial  resources  and  associated  wildlife  populations 
could  include  restoration  of  these  areas  with  native  cover  types.  Many  of  the  areas  identified  for 
temporary  use  are  previously  disturbed  habitats  that  have  become  reestablished  as  natural 
areas.  Mitigation  of  impacts  in  these  areas  to  stabilize  soils  and  reestablish  habitat  may  include 
grading  and  planting  with  native  plant  species.  The  adjacent  lands  to  be  temporarily  leased 
from  the  USACE  could  be  restored  to  a  use  and  cover  type  agreed  upon  with  the  USACE 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  These  measures,  in  combination,  could  restore  quality  habitat  for 
resident  wildlife  populations.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Wetlands 

Wetlands  are  considered  to  be  an  important  terrestrial  resource  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  provide 
habitat  for  wildlife  that  frequent  the  area.  The  quality  of  the  habitat  provided  by  wetlands  at  the 
site  is  impacted  by  the  fact  that  much  of  the  area  is  dominated  by  the  invasive  common  reed 
( Phragmites  australis).  These  wetlands  are  regulated  under  the  authority  and  jurisdiction  of  the 
USACE  and  NJDEP  (Section  2.4.1). 

The  USACE  approach  is  that  mitigation  may  only  be  used  after  all  appropriate  and  practical 
steps  to  avoid  and  minimize  adverse  impacts  to  aquatic  resources,  including  nontidal  wetlands 
and  streams,  have  been  taken.  Further,  the  USACE  requires  all  remaining  unavoidable  impacts 
to  be  compensated  to  the  extent  appropriate  and  practicable.  The  USACE  could  monitor  or 
require  monitoring  for  compliance  with  the  USACE-issued  permits.  The  USACE  permit  could 
include  special  conditions  that  could  require  PSEG  to  ensure  that  the  created  and  enhanced 
wetlands  meet  the  Federal  wetland  criteria  outlined  in  the  report  entitled  Corps  of  Engineers 
Wetlands  Delineation  Manual  (USACE  1987-TN2066).  If  the  USACE  did  not  find  the  wetlands 
and  stream  mitigation  satisfactory,  it  could  determine  whether  adverse  impacts  to  the  waterway 
and  wetlands  were  more  than  minimal  and  any  project  modifications  could  be  warranted.  Also, 
the  USACE  would  require  PSEG  to  assume  all  liability  for  accomplishing  the  corrective  work  in 
accordance  with  Compensatory  Mitigation  for  Losses  of  Aquatic  Resources  (73  FR  19594- 
TN1789;  33  CFR  Part  320-TN424;  33  CFR  Part  325-TN425). 

PSEG  could  take  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  impacts  to  jurisdictional  wetlands  to  the 
maximum  extent  possible.  A  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  located 
adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS  facilities  on  Artificial  Island.  Mitigation  measures  to  be 
taken  to  avoid  or  minimize  adverse  impacts  to  waters  of  the  United  States  could  include  the 
following:  minimizing  encroachment  into  coastal  wetlands:  minimizing  encroachment  into 
NJDEP-regulated  freshwater  wetlands:  use  of  already  existing  sediment  disposal  basins  for 
plant  development  (i.e. ,  the  PSEG  permitted  disposal  facility  and  the  USACE  CDF);  refinement 
of  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  (Figure  2-2)  to  avoid  various  wetland  areas  throughout  the 
PSEG  Site;  and  a  causeway  built  on  elevated  piers  or  bridges,  instead  of  on  fill,  to  minimize 
direct  impacts  to  tidal  wetlands  and  to  avoid  impacts  to  tidal  creeks  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Additional  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential  impacts  to  wetlands  could  be  formulated 
following  the  selection  of  a  reactor  technology  and  could  continue  to  be  devised  throughout  the 
design  phase  as  detailed  site  layouts  were  developed.  This  could  include  the  evaluation  of  soil 
management  and  use  options  aimed  at  reducing  the  limits  of  construction  (i.e.,  fill  areas)  to 
reduce  the  impact  footprint  from  that  shown  on  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  (Figure  2-2).  The 
options  available  would  depend  on  the  technology  chosen.  The  process  of  determining  the 
most  environmentally  sensitive  and  practicable  alternatives  could  continue  throughout  the 
permitting  process  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Compensatory  Actions 

Following  the  implementation  of  reasonable  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  impacts  to  wetlands, 
compensation  for  unavoidable  adverse  impacts  could  be  undertaken  with  the  execution  of  an 
approved  wetland  restoration  and/or  rehabilitation  program.  In  selecting  a  site  for  wetland

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


mitigation,  the  following  factors  are  typically  considered:  existing  land  use  (historic  and  current), 
property  ownership  or  potential  for  acquisition,  hydrologic  potential,  proximity  to  other  wetland 
sites,  site  topography,  connectivity  to  adjacent  natural  habitats,  site  accessibility,  and  the 
presence  of  or  potential  to  develop  hydric  soils  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Opportunities  for  wetland  mitigation  exist  at  various  locations  throughout  the  PSEG  Site 
and  vicinity.  Factors  that  may  influence  site  selection  for  wetland  creation  include 
topography,  soil  types,  watershed  size,  and  the  presence  of  adjacent  streams  as  a 
source  of  additional  water  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Once  a  candidate  mitigation  site  has  been  selected,  wetland  mitigation  could  be  achieved 
through  a  series  of  rehabilitation  and/or  restoration  methods.  These  methods  could  be 
site-specific  and  might  include  the  control  of  Phragmites,  restoration  of  the  hydrologic  state 
(levee  removal,  channel  design,  and  reestablishing  a  connection  of  upland  areas  to  tidal 
influences),  and  wetland  enhancement  that  included  the  restoration  of  desirable  and  native 
vegetation  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Wetland  mitigation  plan  details  would  primarily  be  guided  by  conditions  established  under  CWA 
Section  404  permits  issued  by  the  USACE  or  the  NJDEP  Land  Use  Regulation  Program  and 
Section  401  water-quality  certifications  issued  by  NJDEP.  Therefore,  specific  wetland  mitigation 
efforts  could  be  determined  as  part  of  such  authorizations  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Several  candidate  mitigation  areas  that  have  the  potential  to  meet  some  or  all  of  PSEG  wetland 
mitigation  needs  were  identified  during  the  ESP  application  process.  These  candidate 
mitigation  areas  include  portions  of  the  existing  PSEG  Site,  Mannington  Meadow,  Mason’s 
Point,  and  additional  areas  of  the  PSEG  ACW  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Wetland  mitigation  concepts  for  each  area  are  outlined  below  and  include  the  enhancement 
and/or  development  of  coastal  and  freshwater  wetland  systems.  A  network  of  marsh  creeks  is 
integral  to  the  restoration  of  coastal  marsh  and  would  address  the  loss  of  creeks  within  the 
existing  marsh. 

Onsite 

The  PSEG  Site  includes  about  149  ac  of  Phragmites- dominated  wetlands  that  could  be  used  for 
wetlands  mitigation.  Most  onsite  wetlands  are  tidally  influenced  coastal  wetlands  where 
Phragmites  control  may  allow  Spartina  (cordgrass)  and  other  native  marsh  species  to 
revegetate  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Mannington  Meadow 

Mannington  Meadow  is  a  brackish  estuary  located  on  the  Salem  River  in  Salem  County,  New 
Jersey.  It  provides  significant  habitat  for  numerous  species  of  migrating,  wintering,  and 
breeding  birds,  including  waterfowl,  shorebirds,  and  raptors.  The  area  also  supports  a  brackish- 
and  freshwater-based  fishery.  Mannington  Meadow  contains  open  water,  emergent  wetlands, 
and  adjacent  farmland.  The  presence  of  degraded  marsh  in  this  area  provides  the  potential  for 
restoration  opportunities  for  conversion  into  a  functional  tidal  brackish  ecosystem.  The  keys  to 
successful  restoration  in  this  area  could  include  increasing  the  incoming  freshwater  flow  from

the  Salem  River  and  reducing  the  coverage  of  Phragmites  to  allow  Spartina  and  other  desirable 
marsh  species  to  revegetate  the  area.  Mannington  Meadow  is  a  large  enough  area  (3,800  ac) 
to  provide  good  mitigation  opportunities;  however,  much  of  it  is  in  private,  State,  or  Federal 
ownership  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Mason's  Point 

Mason's  Point,  located  in  Elsinboro  Township  near  Alloway  Creek,  is  2.5  mi  upstream  from  the 
creek  confluence  with  the  Delaware  River.  Mason’s  Point  existed  as  an  impounded  coastal 
marsh  with  near  monotypic  stands  of  Phragmites  in  the  mid-1990s.  Levee  failure  after  that  time 
opened  the  system  to  limited  and  inefficient  tidal  flow  from  Alloway  Creek  into  portions  of  the 
site.  Full  salt  marsh  restoration  through  levee  removal  and  channel  installation  could  restore  the 
natural  daily  tidal  exchange.  In  addition,  Phragmites  control  could  promote  the  revegetation  of 
the  site  by  Spartina  and  other  desirable  marsh  species.  Mason’s  Point  is  owned  by  the  State  of 
New  Jersey  and  is  1,000  ac  in  area  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Alloway  Creek  Watershed 

The  western  portion  of  the  PSEG  ACW  Site  is  not  part  of  the  PSEG  EEP  restoration  area.  The 
ACW  is  located  in  Elsinboro  and  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Townships  in  Salem  County,  New 
Jersey.  The  ACW  was  originally  part  of  the  more  than  2,800-ac  Alloway  Creek  site  in  the  PSEG 
EEP.  Therefore,  herbicide  control  was  applied  at  the  beginning  of  the  program.  Afterward,  the 
Alloway  Creek  EEP  site  was  reduced  in  size.  This  left  more  than  1,400  ac  in  the  western 
portion  of  the  ACW  unrestored  outside  the  PSEG  EEP  restoration  area.  Currently,  this  western 
portion  is  a  non-impounded  coastal  marsh  with  monotypic  stands  of  Phragmites.  The  key 
component  of  restoration  would  consist  of  Phragmites  control  to  allow  Spartina  and  other 
desirable  marsh  species  to  revegetate  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

4. 3. 1.5  Summary  of  Construction  Impacts  on  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Resources 

Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  associated  with  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
on  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  a  negligible  impact  on  most  terrestrial  resources.  Also,  building 
activities  are  expected  to  have  a  minimal  effect  on  important  species  on  the  PSEG  Site. 
However,  the  permanent  loss  of  108  ac  and  the  temporary  loss  of  about  62  ac  would  have  a 
noticeable,  but  not  destabilizing,  effect  on  wetland  resources  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Additionally, 
preconstruction  activities  would  temporarily  affect  about  30  ac  of  offsite  wetland  resources. 
Mitigation  of  wetland  resources  may  be  warranted. 

Based  on  the  above  information,  the  review  team  concludes  that  impacts  on  terrestrial 
resources  from  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  MODERATE. 

The  MODERATE  impact  level  is  associated  with  the  loss  of  108  ac  of  important  wetland 
resources,  and  the  NRC-authorized  activities  would  be  significant  contributors  to  the  noticeable 
impact.  However,  given  the  amount  of  wetland  resources  in  the  area,  the  review  team 
determined  that  the  habitat  loss  would  not  destabilize  wetland  resources  in  the  vicinity.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


4.3.2  Aquatic  Impacts 

Before  initiating  any  site-preparation  or  development  activities,  PSEG  would  be  required  to 
obtain  the  appropriate  authorizations  regulating  alterations  to  waters  of  the  United  States, 
including  ponds  and  creeks.  The  list  of  probable  authorizations  is  presented  in  Section  4.2, 
with  additional  detail  in  Appendix  H.  Site-preparation  activities  that  could  directly  affect  onsite 
and  offsite  aquatic  ecosystems  include  site  preparation  for  installing  plant  structures  and  cooling 
towers,  switchyards,  and  the  temporary  laydown  area;  making  improvements  to  the  HCGS 
barge  slip;  building  the  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility  (also  referred  to  as  the  barge 
unloading  and  mooring  facility  in  the  USACE  public  notice  [USACE  2014-TN4319])  and  adjacent 
heavy  haul  road  bulkhead;  installing  the  cooling  water  system  intake  and  discharge  structures; 
and  building  the  proposed  causeway.  Aquatic  habitats  potentially  affected  include  the  onsite 
desilt  basins  and  small  marsh  creeks,  habitats  associated  with  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  and 
the  interconnected  system  of  tidal  wetlands  and  marsh  creeks  primarily  north  of  the  PSEG  Site. 
Potential  direct  impacts  on  aquatic  resources  as  a  result  of  site-preparation  activities  would 
involve  physical  alteration  of  habitat  (e.g.,  infilling,  dredging,  pile  driving)  including  temporary  or 
permanent  removal  of  associated  benthic  organisms,  sedimentation,  changes  in  hydrological 
regimes,  and  changes  in  water  quality.  Potential  indirect  impacts  include  increased  runoff  from 
impervious  surfaces  and  subsequent  erosion  and  sedimentation  and  isolation  of  marsh  creek 
segments  due  to  infilling  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

4.3.2. 7  Aquatic  Resources  -  Site  and  Vicinity 

Desilt  Basins  and  Onsite  Marsh  Creeks 

The  desilt  basins  located  on  the  PSEG  Site  have  variable  surface  area  depending  on  use  and 
operation  of  the  basins  for  dredge  disposal  operations  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  desilt  basins 
within  the  proposed  power  block  and  cooling  tower  areas  are  perched  water  bodies  used  for 
rainfall  and  stormwater  management  and  have  no  surface-water  connection  to  the  Delaware 
River  Estuary  or  adjacent  small  marsh  creeks  on  the  site.  Site-preparation  and  building 
activities  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  cooling  towers  would  involve  filling  in  the  desilt 
basins  and  thus  would  result  in  complete  conversion  of  these  desilt  basins  to  industrial  land  use. 
Sampling  surveys  of  these  desilt  basins  and  other  nearby  small  onsite  marsh  creeks  for  fish  and 
macroinvertebrates  indicate  low-diversity  communities  characterized  by  resident  fish  and 
macroinvertebrate  species  that  are  generally  ubiquitous  in  shallow  aquatic  freshwater  systems 
of  the  mid-Atlantic  coastal  region,  as  described  in  Section  2. 4. 2.1.  In  addition,  the  desilt  basins 
do  not  provide  unique  aquatic  habitat  or  support  populations  of  important  aquatic  species. 
Erosion  and  runoff  mitigation  practices  would  be  used  to  prevent  siltation  from  building  activities 
in  nearby  small  marsh  creeks  on  the  site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Although  loss  of  all  aquatic 
species  in  the  desilt  basins  would  occur,  the  loss  would  have  a  negligible  effect  on  aquatic 
resources  in  the  vicinity. 

The  most  dominant  and  biologically  productive  of  the  aquatic  ecosystems  in  the  vicinity  of  the 
site  and  those  areas  north  of  the  site  are  the  tidally  influenced  wetlands  and  their  interconnected 
system  of  marsh  creeks.  Potential  building  impacts  to  marsh  creeks  located  on  the  site  include 
infilling  and  elimination  of  portions  of  the  marsh  creek  system.  Although  some  small  and 
localized  areas  of  habitat  would  be  lost  or  impaired  by  building  activities,  large  amounts  of 


NUREG-2168

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


similar  habitat  exist  throughout  the  site.  Fish  and  mobile  macroinvertebrates  could  relocate  to 
other  areas  of  the  marsh  creek  system  not  affected  by  building  activities.  The  marsh  creek  and 
channelized  stream  segments  that  would  be  affected  by  building  activities  are  not  known  to 
support  any  Federally  or  State-listed  species,  nor  do  they  provide  unique  aquatic  habitats  that 
are  not  available  nearby.  Stormwater  control,  erosion  control,  stream  crossing,  and 
sedimentation  BMPs  would  be  followed  in  accordance  with  Federal  and  New  Jersey  permitting 
requirements  for  water  quality  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG  estimates  permanent  loss  of 
7,265  linear  ft  of  creek  channels  and  potential  isolation  of  2,320  linear  ft  of  marsh  creek 
channels  from  their  tidal  connection  due  to  placement  of  fill  from  the  switchyard,  power  block, 
temporary  laydown,  causeway,  and  cooling  tower  areas  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Within  the 
nearby  ACW  Site  there  are  a  total  of  16,343  channelized  streams  with  a  total  estimated  length 
of  1 ,105,485  ft  (see  Figure  2-21 ).  Therefore,  the  permanent  loss  of  onsite  marsh  creeks  due  to 
site  preparation  and  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  equivalent  to  only  0.7  percent 
of  the  total  marsh  creek  density  within  this  one  wetland  restoration  area  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Offsite  Marsh  Creek  Drainages 

An  estimated  2,123  linear  ft  of  marsh  creek  channels  off  the  site  would  be  crossed  by  the 
proposed  causeway  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Installation  of  the  elevated  causeway  would  require 
permanent  pier  placement  for  support  structures.  However,  PSEG  plans  to  avoid  placement  in 
stream  channels  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Runoff  from  disturbed  areas  would  be  temporary  and 
controlled  through  the  use  of  BMPs  required  for  water  quality  in  compliance  with  Federal  and 
New  Jersey  permitting  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Pile  driving  for  pier  placement  would  create 
short-term  noise  disturbances.  The  marsh  creek  system  and  wetlands  within  the  coastal 
wetlands  surrounding  the  site  are  characterized  by  a  high  density  of  channelized  streams  that 
have  low  biological  diversity  and  productivity,  as  described  in  Sections  2. 4. 1.1  and  2.4.2. 1. 
Aquatic  organisms  in  the  vicinity  are  mobile  and  would  likely  avoid  the  area  of  installation. 

Delaware  River  Estuary 

Installation  activities  with  the  potential  to  affect  the  aquatic  resources  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  include  improvements  to  and  use  of  the  existing  HCGS  barge  slip,  a  new  barge  storage 
area  and  unloading  facility,  an  adjacent  heavy  haul  road  bulkhead,  and  the  intake  and  discharge 
structures  along  the  eastern  shore  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  (Figure  2-2).  Shoreline 
installation  and  site-preparation  activities  would  require  an  SWPPP.  developed  as  part  of 
NJPDES  stormwater  permit,  which  would  describe  BMPs  to  control  sedimentation  and  erosion 
and  provide  stormwater  management.  Shoreline  structures  would  be  hardened  to  protect  them 
from  shoreline  erosion  using  placement  of  concrete  or  riprap  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
Approximately  1  ac  of  open  water  would  be  filled  (average  width  of  fill  would  be  10  ft)  due  to 
placement  of  the  bulkhead  cap  and  sheeting  along  the  bulkhead  shoreline  (PSEG  2014- 
TN4235). 

Improvements  to  the  HCGS  barge  slip  would  include  deepening  the  existing  barge  slip  by 
another  2  ft  to  accommodate  equipment-carrying  barges  (Cook  2009-TN2713).  An  estimated 
1 .350  yd3  of  dredged  material  would  be  removed  within  the  existing  HCGS  barge  slip  to  allow 
for  additional  clearance  of  barges  carrying  equipment  to  the  PSEG  Site.  If  the  final  plant 
designs  indicate  modules  larger  than  54  ft  in  width  are  required,  the  existing  60-ft-wide  HCGS

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


barge  slip  may  be  widened  an  additional  20  ft  along  the  south  side  of  the  barge  slip  and 
dredged  an  additional  2  ft  below  current  barge  slip  depth.  A  double  row  of  sheet  piling  would 
need  to  be  placed  before  removal  of  excess  earth  by  dredging.  An  estimated  5,800  yd3  of 
material  would  be  removed,  and  the  existing  riprap  at  the  front  end  of  the  slip  would  be  removed 
and  then  replaced  at  the  widened  river  end  of  the  slip  (Cook  2009-TN27 13). 

The  new  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility  would  require  dredging  about  440,000  yd3  of 
sediment  to  lower  the  river  bottom  by  4.5  ft  over  61  ac  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  An  additional 
0.05  ac  of  river  bottom  habitat  would  be  lost  for  installation  of  seven  20-ft-diameter  barge 
mooring  caissons.  Installation  of  a  new  intake  structure  would  require  dredging  of  about 
225,000  yd3  of  sediment  to  lower  the  river  bottom  by  4.5  ft  over  31  ac  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 
Dredging,  grading,  and  backfilling  activities  would  be  required  for  installation  of  a  new  discharge 
structure;  approximately  0.2  ac  of  tidal  waters  would  be  affected  (PSEG  2014-TN4235).  In  total, 
92  ac  of  open  water  habitat  would  be  permanently  affected  by  dredging.  Dredged  material 
disposal  would  be  either  on  the  site  or  in  another  approved  upland  disposal  facility  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

The  installation  of  the  barge  storage  and  unloading  facility,  haul  road  bulkhead,  and  intake  and 
discharge  structures  would  result  in  temporary  disturbances  to  the  aquatic  habitat  in  those 
portions  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  An  increase  in  suspended  sediments  could  occur 
during  dredging  activities;  however,  PSEG  determined  that  due  to  the  natural  high  turbidity  of 
the  Delaware  Estuary  at  the  project  location,  any  increase  in  sedimentation  would  not  be 
noticeable  (PSEG  201 5-TN4234).  PSEG  would  comply  with  NJDEP  and  USACE  permitting 
regulations  regarding  the  timing  and  duration  of  dredging  to  avoid  sensitive  aquatic  life  stage 
development  or  spawning  (e.g.,  the  current  USACE  work  window  to  avoid  dredge  activities 
occurs  between  March  1  and  June  30)  (PSEG  2015-TN4234).  As  described  in  Section  2. 3. 3.1, 
the  review  team  reviewed  a  recent  report  on  sediment  analysis  for  the  Delaware  River  Basin 
that  describes  sediment  samples  near  the  PSEG  Site  as  probably/potentially  suitable  for  aquatic 
habitat  restoration  projects  (DERSMPW  2013-TN4204).  Therefore,  dredging  in  this  area  near 
the  PSEG  Site  is  unlikely  to  introduce  adverse  exposure  from  sediment  contaminants  to  nearby 
aquatic  biota.  PSEG  proposes  to  use  a  hydraulic  suction  dredge  to  further  minimize  increases 
in  turbidity  and  sedimentation,  to  limit  the  duration  of  dredging,  and  to  avoid  the  need  to  handle 
dredged  material  twice  (PSEG  2015-TN4234).  PSEG  would  also  use  appropriate  BMPs  to 
minimize  sedimentation  effects  as  required  for  Federal  and  State  permitting.  Motile 
invertebrates,  fish,  and  sea  turtles  might  swim  into  this  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary, 
but  they  would  be  able  to  swim  away  or  likely  would  avoid  the  area  due  to  dredging  activity  and 
noise  from  pile  driving  that  may  occur  simultaneously. 

Mobile  macroinvertebrates  in  this  area  might  be  able  to  occupy  adjacent  habitat  in  the  Delaware 
River  Estuary  because  the  species  composition  and  abundance  of  the  macroinvertebrate 
community  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  site  are  similar  to  those  of  benthic 
communities  in  adjacent  benthic  areas  of  the  estuary.  Although  permanent  alteration  of  at  least 
92  ac  of  river  bottom  habitat  would  occur,  the  impacts  to  aquatic  communities  in  the  vicinity  are 
expected  to  be  minimal  because  benthic  organisms  would  begin  to  re-colonize  the  area 
following  the  completion  of  dredging  activities  (Wilber  and  Clarke  2007-TN4271 ).

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


The  depth  of  the  areas  identified  for  dredging  is  a  minimum  of  10  ft  (3.05  m)  relative  to  mean 
low  water  with  the  exception  of  the  western  boundary  of  Artificial  Island,  which  is  shallower  than 
10  ft  and  consists  of  artificially  placed  rock.  Mitigation  is  not  warranted  because  there  is  no 
shallow  water  habitat  conversion  to  deep  water  habitat  (PSEG  2015-TN4234),  and 
compensatory  mitigation  is  generally  not  required  where  a  habitat  change  does  not  occur. 

Installation  of  piles  would  generate  pulsed  noise  and  vibrations  that  may  affect  nearby  aquatic 
species.  PSEG  estimated  acoustic  effects  from  representative  pile-driving  studies  to  determine 
pile  installation  effects  on  aquatic  biota.  In-water  activities  included  daytime  installation  of  24- 
in. -wide  steel  sheeting  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  for  the  intake  structure  (650  sheet  piles),  the 
haul  road  bulkhead  (2,400  sheet  piles),  and  the  barge  unloading  facility  20-ft-diameter  caissons 
(1 ,200  sheet  piles)  with  a  vibratory  hammer.  Causeway  installation  would  also  occur  during  the 
daytime,  and  analysis  was  conducted  for  about  one  thousand  30-in. -square  concrete  piles  using 
an  impact  hammer  with  additional  cushioning  to  reduce  pile  head  damage  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4234).  PSEG  used  the  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  (NMFS)  Pile  Driving  Calculations 
spreadsheet  model  (Caltrans  2013-TN4236)  to  calculate  isopleths  for  the  peak  sound  pressure 
level  (SPLpeak),  cumulative  sound  exposure  level  (SELCUm),  and  behavioral  root  mean  square 
sound  pressure  level  (SPLrms)  using  specific  information  on  piles  such  as  installation  method, 
number  of  piles,  and  type  of  pile. 

The  criteria  for  fish  are  as  follows: 

•  206  dB  re:  IpPa  SPLpeak, 

•  187  dB  re:  1pPa2,s  SELCUm  for  fish  >  2  cm,  183  dB  re:  1pPa2-s  SELCUm  for  fish  <  2  cm,  and 

•  150dBre:  1pPaSPLrms. 

The  criteria  for  determination  of  the  potential  onset  of  physical  injury  includes  exceedance  of 
both  the  peak  sound  pressure  level  (SPLpeak)  and  the  cumulative  sound  exposure  level  (SELCum). 
A  determination  for  potential  behavioral  effects  is  made  using  exceedance  of  the  root  mean 
square  sound  pressure  level  (SPLrms)  (Caltrans  2013-TN4236).  Distances  from  the  pile-driving 
activity  that  exceed  these  criteria  are  presented  in  Table  4-3.

The  onset  of  injury  from  impulsive  sound  (pile  driving)  is  1 90  dB  re:  1  pPa  SPLrms  and  1 60  dB  re: 
1  pPa  SPLrms  for  disruption  of  natural  behavior  from  impulsive  sound  (NAVSEA  2013-TN4237). 

Based  on  the  NMFS  model,  the  206  dB  SPLpeak  is  only  exceeded  immediately  adjacent  to  pile¬ 
driving  activity  and  does  not  extend  1  m  (3  ft)  out  except  for  causeway  installation.  The 
187/183  dB  SELcum  for  fish  (which  is  similar  to  190  dB  SPLrms  for  sea  turtles)  exceedance 
distance  for  the  proposed  causeway  is  216/398  m  (709/1,306  ft);  however,  this  distance  extends 
over  mostly  vegetated  marsh  plain  and  shallow  marsh  creeks,  not  open  water  (Figure  4-2). 

The  behavioral  effects  criterion  of  150  dB  SPLrms  for  fish  is  exceeded  for  the  causeway  pile 
installation  up  to  1,165  m  (3,825  ft)  from  the  source,  which  is  mostly  vegetated  marsh  plain  and 
shallow  marsh  creeks  (PSEG  2015-TN4234).  For  vibratory  shoreline  steel  sheet  pile 
installation  at  Artificial  Island,  caisson  installation,  and  intake  installation,  the  behavioral  effects 
criterion  exceedance  for  fish  extends  from  the  source  out  to  74  m  (243  ft)  into  the  Delaware 
River  (Figure  4-2),  which  could  also  be  a  conservative  estimate  for  sea  turtles  (criterion  of  160 
dB  SPLrms). 

As  a  comparison,  PSEG  also  assessed  vessel-related  sounds  for  large  container  transport 
ships  moving  at  22.7  knots  and  smaller  tugboats.  Both  vessel  types  have  small  behavioral 
exceedance  zones  for  fish  of  349  m  (1 ,1 18  ft)  and  10.9  m  (36  ft),  respectively  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4234),  which  are  shown  in  Figure  4-2. 

Vessel  use  during  dredging  activities,  installation  of  the  in-water  structures,  offloading  of 
materials  from  barges,  and  transportation  of  large  system  components  to  the  PSEG  Site  may 
affect  the  aquatic  resources  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  particularly  the  benthos  or  benthic 
dwelling  organisms.  The  main  impacts  of  vessel  use  would  include  turbulence  from  propellers 
(prop  wash),  collisions  with  aquatic  species,  and  accidental  spills  of  materials  overboard.  PSEG 
estimated  the  annual  number  of  vessel  trips  for  the  installation  activities  correlated  to  the 
activities  described  for  the  Department  of  the  Army  permit  to  be  between  247  and  357.  This  is 
an  incremental  increase  to  the  reported  annual  average  of  4,485  commercial  vessel  trips  in  the 
Delaware  River  and  Estuary  between  2007  and  2014  (PSEG  2015-TN4234).  PSEG  assessed 
the  possibility  of  barge  traffic  near  the  PSEG  Site  coming  within  1  m  of  the  bottom  was  limited  to 
the  deepest  draft  vessels,  which  would  be  required  for  delivery  of  the  heaviest  power  plant 
components  and  would  be  limited  to  slow  travel  speeds  and  delivery  times  at  high  tide  during 
calm  weather  (PSEG  2015-TN4234).  Plant  heavy  component  construction  activity  would  not 
occur  under  an  ESP  and  would  be  reviewed  under  a  COL  application  to  construct  and  operate  a 
new  nuclear  plant.  The  review  team  determined  that  vessel  traffic  during  site-preparation 
activities  would  result  in  minimal  disturbance  to  benthic  habitats  associated  with  the  PSEG  Site 
as  it  would  occur  in  deeper  waters  associated  with  the  installation  of  piles  or  dredging  activities 
and  should  not  affect  the  general  resources  in  the  region  along  this  coast  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary.

4. 3. 2. 2  Important  A  qua  tic  Species  and  Habitats 

This  section  describes  the  potential  impacts  on  important  aquatic  species  resulting  from  site 
preparation  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  including  the  HCGS  barge  slip 
improvements,  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility,  haul  road  bulkhead,  intake  and 
discharge  structures,  and  causeway.  The  review  team  has  determined  that  building  impacts  on 
aquatic  resources  would  be  limited  to  the  onsite  desilt  basins  and  small  marsh  creeks,  marsh 
creek  and  stream  drainages,  and  a  small  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  The  general 
life  histories  of  these  species  are  presented  in  Section  2.4.2.  The  review  team  prepared  a  BA 
and  an  essential  fish  habitat  (EFH)  assessment  and  supplemental  documents  for  the  NMFS 
(see  Appendix  F)  documenting  the  potential  impacts  on  the  Federally  listed  threatened  and 
endangered  aquatic  species  for  the  BA  and  managed  species  for  the  EFH  assessment 
identified  in  correspondence  from  the  NMFS  (NMFS  2010-TN2171;  NMFS  2013-TN2804). 

Commercial/Recreational  Species 

American  Eel  ( Anguilla  rostrata)  and  White  Perch  ( Morone  americana)  have  been  observed  in 
the  desilt  basins  and  marsh  creeks,  and  the  Atlantic  Menhaden  ( Brevoortia  tyrannus)  and 
Striped  Bass  (M.  saxatiiis )  were  observed  in  the  marsh  creeks  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Filling  in 
the  onsite  desilt  basins  would  remove  this  habitat  and  result  in  a  loss  of  all  species  present  in 
these  water  bodies.  However,  only  a  few  American  Eel  and  White  Perch  were  observed  in 
these  habitats,  where  harvesting  is  not  permitted,  and  these  species  are  abundant  elsewhere  in 
the  offsite  marsh  creek  drainages  and  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  (see  Tables  2-10  and  2-1 1 
in  Section  2.4.2. 1 ).  Thus,  removal  of  onsite  desilt  basin  habitats  would  not  noticeably  affect 
population  abundances  for  the  commercial  or  recreational  fishery  of  these  species. 

All  commercial  and  recreational  species  listed  in  Section  2.4.2. 1  with  the  exception  of  the  Silver 
Hake  ( Merluccius  bilinearis ),  the  eastern  oyster  ( Crassostrea  virginica),  the  horseshoe  crab 
(. Limulus  polyphemus),  the  knobbed  whelk  ( Busycon  carica),  the  channeled  whelk  ( Busycotypus 
canaliculatus),  and  the  northern  quahog  clam  ( Mercenaria  mercenaria)  have  been  observed  in 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  between  2003  and  2010 
(PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568; 

PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Building  and  dredging  activities  associated  with  the  HCGS  barge  slip  improvements,  barge 
storage  area  and  unloading  facility,  haul  road  bulkhead,  intake  structure,  and  discharge 
structure  may  affect  local  habitat  use  by  these  species  due  to  noise  avoidance  and  sediment 
dispersion.  These  impacts  are  expected  to  be  temporary  and  minimized  with  the  use  of  BMPs 
as  described  in  Section  4.3.2. 1  to  minimize  sedimentation  and  erosion.  It  is  expected  that  fish 
and  blue  crabs  ( Callinectes  sapidus)  would  use  nearby  unaffected  habitat  and  would  resume 
use  of  the  habitats  within  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  PSEG  Site  after  completion  of 
these  activities.  In  addition,  these  species  are  present  throughout  the  Delaware  River  Estuary 
region,  and  any  effects  on  commercial  or  recreational  fisheries  due  to  installation  activities  in  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  not 
expected  to  be  noticeable.  Although  eastern  oyster  beds  are  present  within  6  mi  of  Artificial 
Island  to  the  south,  the  localized  building,  dredging,  and  installation  activities  are  not  expected 
to  affect  these  oyster  beds.

Ecologically  Important  Species 

All  four  ecologically  important  species  described  in  Section  2. 4. 2. 3  are  present  in  the  Delaware 
River  Estuary  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site:  Blueback  Herring  ( Alosa  aestivalis ),  Alewife 
(A  pseudoharengus ),  Atlantic  Silverside  ( Menidia  menidia ),  and  Bay  Anchovy  ( Anchoa  mitchilli) 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Building  and  dredging  activities  associated  with  the  HCGS  barge  slip 
improvements,  the  new  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility,  haul  road  bulkhead,  intake 
structure,  and  discharge  structure  may  affect  the  presence  of  or  habitat  use  by  these  species  in 
the  vicinity  of  these  activities  due  to  noise  avoidance  and  increased  sedimentation.  These 
impacts  are  expected  to  be  temporary  and  minimized  with  the  use  of  BMPs  to  reduce 
sedimentation  and  erosion.  It  is  expected  that  these  fish  would  also  avoid  noise  and  vibration 
associated  with  pile-installation  activities,  use  nearby  unaffected  habitat,  and  would  resume  use 
of  the  habitats  within  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  PSEG  Site  after  completion  of 
building  activities. 

Federally  and  State-Listed  Species 

As  part  of  their  responsibilities  under  section  7  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act  of  1 973  (16  USC 
1531  et  seq.  -TNI 010),  the  review  team  (NRC  and  USACE  staff)  prepared  a  BA  documenting 
potential  impacts  on  Federally  listed  threatened  or  endangered  aquatic  species  as  a  result  of 
building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review  team  received  comments  from  NMFS  (2014- 
TN4203)  and  additional  clarification  on  comments  (NRC  2015-TN4209)  and  then  prepared  a 
supplemental  BA.  The  BA  and  the  supplement  are  provided  in  Appendix  F  and  the  findings  and 
determinations  are  summarized  in  this  section.  No  critical  habitat  has  been  designated  for 
aquatic  species  under  NMFS  jurisdiction  in  the  action  area,  which  is  considered  the  area  that 
may  be  directly  or  indirectly  affected  by  the  proposed  action  (NMFS  2014-TN4238). 

Sea  Turtles 


The  Federally  threatened  Northwest  Atlantic  distinct  population  segment  of  the  loggerhead  sea 
turtle  ( Caretta  caretta)  and  the  Federally  endangered  Kemp’s  ridley  turtle  ( Lepidochelys  kempii) 
are  known  to  occur  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  may  swim 
near  the  SGS  cooling  water  intake  area  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  Federally  endangered 
Atlantic  green  sea  turtle  ( Chelonia  mydas)  is  also  known  to  occur  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary 
near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Sea  turtles  may  be  affected  by  noise  from 
installation  of  piles.  In  addition,  some  sea  turtles  rely  on  fish  prey  species  that  may  also  be 
affected  by  pile  installation  noise.  PSEG  provided  an  analysis  using  criteria  accepted  by  NMFS 
for  estimating  exceedance  distances  to  determine  cumulative  sound  exposure  effects  and 
behavioral  adverse  effects  to  fish  from  pile-driving  activities.  Figure  4-2  shows  the  areas  for 
noise  effects,  which  will  occur  over  a  period  of  approximately  50  days  for  causeway  piling 
installation,  10  days  for  intake  structure  sheet  piles,  and  20  days  each  for  haul  road  bulkhead 
and  caisson  sheet  pile  installation  (PSEG  2015-TN4234).  While  sea  turtle  effects  were  not 
specifically  assessed,  the  exceedance  distances  provide  a  conservative  analysis  for  sea  turtle 
for  injury  effect  and  adverse  behavioral  effect.  Given  the  short  duration  of  activity,  and  the 
abundance  of  nearby,  adjacent  unaffected  habitat,  it  is  likely  that  sea  turtles  and  their  mobile 
prey  will  avoid  the  zones  of  cumulative  sound  and  adverse  behavioral  effects  (NMFS  2014- 
TN4239).  Disruption  of  habitat  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  from  sedimentation  and  scouring

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


due  to  propeller  wash  is  expected  to  be  localized  and  temporary  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Sea 
turtles  likely  would  avoid  habitats  in  the  area  of  incoming  and  outgoing  barge  traffic  and  could 
find  unaffected  habitat  nearby  for  foraging  activities.  Therefore,  effects  on  sea  turtles  and  their 
prey  from  dredging,  pile-driving  activities,  and  barge  traffic  would  be  minor. 

Shortnose  Sturgeon 

Federally  endangered  Shortnose  Sturgeon  (Acipenser  brevirostrum)  spawn  in  freshwater 
habitats  in  the  Delaware  River  that  are  well  upstream  of  the  PSEG  Site  near  Delaware  River 
Mile  (RM)  52.  Surveys  of  Shortnose  Sturgeon  movement  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary 
revealed  an  overwintering  population  of  about  6,000  to  14,000  fish  in  the  upper  tidal  portion  of 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  T renton  at  Delaware  RM  131.6  (Hastings  et  al.  1 987-TN2260). 
Shortnose  Sturgeon  move  upstream  into  the  nontidal  reach  of  the  river  in  late  March, 
presumably  to  spawn  before  traveling  downstream  to  lower  tidal  waters  near  Philadelphia 
(O'Herron  et  al.  1993-TN2261 ).  Therefore,  building  activities  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary 
near  the  PSEG  Site  are  not  likely  to  affect  Shortnose  Sturgeon  eggs  or  larvae.  Migrating 
juvenile  and  adult  Shortnose  Sturgeon  may  occur  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  affected 
by  building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site.  One  Shortnose  Sturgeon  was  collected  in  a  trawling 
sample  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  site  in  2004  (PSEG  2005-TN2566),  and  two 
Shortnose  Sturgeon  were  collected  in  2008  and  one  in  2010  from  bottom  trawl  sampling 
between  Delaware  River  Kilometer  (RKM)  100  and  RKM  120  (RM  62.1  and  RM  74.6)  to  the 
north  of  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ).  It  is  expected  that  some 
dredging  will  coincide  with  pile-driving  activities  previously  described,  and  thus  discourage 
sturgeon  and  other  fish  species  from  foraging  in  the  immediate  area  as  described  for  similar  in¬ 
water  activates  in  the  Hudson  River  (NMFS  2014-TN4239).  Disruption  of  habitat  for  foraging  in 
these  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  is  expected  to  be  minor  and  temporary,  due  to  use  of 
hydraulic  dredge  technology,  and  compliance  with  USACE  and  NJDEP  work  window 
requirements.  Like  sea  turtles,  sturgeon  may  be  affected  by  vibration  and  noise  from  sheet  pile 
installation  and  an  increase  in  barge  traffic.  However,  given  the  short  duration  of  activity,  and 
the  abundance  of  nearby,  adjacent  unaffected  habitat,  it  is  likely  that  Shortnose  Sturgeon  and 
their  mobile  prey  will  avoid  the  zones  of  cumulative  sound  and  adverse  behavioral  effects 
(NMFS  2014-TN4239).  As  described  for  sea  turtles,  Shortnose  Sturgeon  would  likely  avoid 
habitats  in  the  area  of  incoming  and  outgoing  barge  traffic  and  could  find  unaffected  habitat 
nearby  for  foraging  activities.  Therefore,  adverse  effects  to  Shortnose  Sturgeon  and  their  prey 
from  dredging,  pile  installation  activities,  and  barge  traffic  would  be  minor. 

Atlantic  Sturgeon 

The  Federally  endangered  Atlantic  Sturgeon  {Acipenser  oxyrinchus  oxyrinchus)  has  life  history 
characteristics  similar  to  those  of  the  Shortnose  Sturgeon  with  the  exception  of  a  preference  for 
more  marine  habitats.  Tagging  studies  in  2005  and  2006  indicated  that  Atlantic  Sturgeon 
followed  migration  patterns  similar  to  those  of  the  Shortnose  Sturgeon,  with  spawning  potentially 
occurring  from  mid-to-late  June  in  the  upper  tidal  Delaware  reaches  between  Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania,  and  Trenton,  New  Jersey  (Simpson  and  Fox  2007-TN2194).  Atlantic  Sturgeon 
juveniles  were  also  observed  around  Artificial  Island  between  1991  and  1998  (ASSRT  2007- 
TN2082).  A  single  Atlantic  Sturgeon  was  collected  in  years  2004  and  2009  in  bottom  trawl 
sampling  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  between  Delaware  RKM  100  and  RKM  120  (RM

62.1  and  RM  74.6)  to  the  north  of  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2010-TN2570). 

It  is  expected  that  some  dredging  will  coincide  with  the  pile-driving  activities  previously 
described,  and  thus  discourage  fish  species  from  foraging  in  the  immediate  area  (NMFS  2014- 
TN4239).  Disruption  of  habitat  for  foraging  in  these  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  is 
expected  to  be  minor  and  temporary,  due  to  use  of  hydraulic  dredge  technology  and  compliance 
with  USACE  and  NJDEP  work  window  requirements.  Like  sea  turtles  and  Shortnose  Sturgeon, 
Atlantic  Sturgeon  may  be  affected  by  vibration  and  noise  from  sheet  pile  installation  and  an 
increase  in  barge  traffic.  However,  given  the  short  duration  of  activity,  and  the  abundance  of 
nearby,  adjacent  unaffected  habitat,  it  is  likely  that  Atlantic  Sturgeon  and  their  mobile  prey  will 
avoid  the  zones  of  cumulative  sound  and  adverse  behavioral  effects  (NMFS  2014-TN4239).  As 
described  above,  Atlantic  Sturgeon  would  likely  avoid  habitats  in  the  area  of  incoming  and 
outgoing  barge  traffic  and  could  find  unaffected  habitat  nearby  for  foraging  activities.  Therefore, 
adverse  effects  to  Atlantic  Sturgeon  and  their  prey  from  dredging,  pile  installation  activities,  and 
barge  traffic  would  be  minor. 

Essential  Fish  Habitats 

The  evaluation  of  EFHs  for  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  includes  a  determination  for  the 
presence  of  Habitat  Areas  of  Particular  Concern  (HAPCs),  as  well  as  a  site-specific  assessment 
offish  habitat.  HAPCs  are  identified  geographical  areas  that  have  elevated  importance,  provide 
important  ecological  functions,  and  are  vulnerable  to  degradation.  No  HAPCs  occur  in  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  (NOAA  2013-TN2177).  Site-specific  assessments  offish  habitats 
associated  with  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in  the  vicinity  of  the  HCGS  barge  facility,  barge 
storage  and  unloading  facility,  haul  road  bulkhead,  and  intake  and  discharge  structures  are 
presented  in  Appendix  F.  The  review  team  prepared  a  supplemental  EFH  to  address  additional 
comments  from  NMFS  related  to  wetlands  alterations,  dredging  activities,  and  pile  installation 
activities  (NMFS  2014-TN4203;  NRC  2014-TN4208).  The  EFH  assessment  and  supplemental 
information  document  in  Appendix  F  provide  the  known  distributions  and  records  of  managed 
species  and  life  stages  and  the  potential  ecological  impacts  of  building  activities  on  the  species, 
their  habitats,  and  their  prey.  Based  on  the  PSEG  plan  for  developing  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  the  review  team  believes  that  short-term  impacts  to  EFHs  associated 
with  dredging,  pile  installation  activities,  and  barge  traffic  would  be  minimal. 

4. 3.2.3  A  quatic  Monitoring 

The  potential  impacts  to  aquatic  resources  from  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and 
associated  facilities  would  be  monitored  under  the  terms  of  authorizations  from  Federal  and 
State  agencies  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Site  engineering  controls,  BMPs  as  described  in 
Section  4.3.2. 1,  erosion-control  measures,  and  siltation  control  measures  would  be  used  to 
manage  stormwater  runoff  and  keep  accidental  spills  from  affecting  nearby  surface  waters 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG  would  adhere  to  the  seasonal  in-water  timing  restrictions  that  are 
imposed  by  the  USACE  and  NJDEP  for  dredging  and  other  in-water  work  to  avoid  sensitive 
spawning  or  recruitment  windows  to  minimize  these  effects  (PSEG  2015-TN4234). 

4. 3. 2. 4  Potential  Mitigation  Measures  for  A  quatic  Impacts 

Impacts  on  aquatic  resources  are  expected  to  be  temporary  because  fish  and  mobile 
invertebrates  likely  would  avoid  areas  of  building  activity  in  the  marsh  creeks  and  Delaware

River  Estuary.  PSEG  plans  to  consult  with  local,  State,  and  Federal  agencies  regarding  any 
additional  and  practicable  mitigation  needs  related  to  the  development  of  the  PSEG  Site 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

4. 3. 2. 5  Summary  of  Impacts  to  A  qua  tic  Resources 

The  review  team  has  reviewed  the  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  associated  with 
a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  potential  impacts  of  those  activities  on 
aquatic  biota  in  the  desilt  basins  and  small  marsh  creeks,  the  marsh  creek  systems,  and  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary.  Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  would  have  the  largest 
effect  on  the  desilt  basins  and  some  onsite  marsh  creek  communities,  and  minor  effects  on 
aquatic  communities  in  the  offsite  marsh  creeks  and  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

Filling  in  the  desilt  basins  and  small  marsh  creeks  would  result  in  a  loss  of  those  habitats. 
However,  the  loss  of  habitat  and  species  in  the  marsh  creeks  is  expected  to  be  minimal 
compared  to  similar  unaffected  marsh  creek  habitats  in  the  region. 

Installation  of  the  new  barge  unloading  facility,  haul  road  bulkhead,  and  water  intake  and 
discharge  structures  and  improvements  to  the  HCGS  barge  slip  would  result  in  temporary 
impacts  at  distinct  locations  within  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  but  these  would  be  largely 
controlled  by  the  use  of  BMPs  associated  with  the  management  of  water  quality.  Based  on  this 
review,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  impacts  resulting  from  the  preconstruction  and 
construction  activities  would  be  minimal. 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  above  observations  from  the  review  team’s 
independent  evaluation,  the  review  team  concludes  that  impacts  to  onsite  aquatic  biota  during 
preconstruction  and  construction  would  be  SMALL,  provided  PSEG  complies  with  BMPs 
required  for  Federal  and  State  permitting.  Based  on  the  above  analysis,  and  because  the 
NRC-authorized  construction  activities  represent  only  a  portion  of  the  analyzed  activities,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  impacts  of  the  NRC-authorized  construction  activities  would  be 
SMALL  and  no  further  mitigation  measures  would  be  warranted. 

4.4  Socioeconomic  Impacts 

Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  (the  review  team  will  refer  to  these  as  building 
activities)  at  the  PSEG  Site  could  affect  individual  communities,  the  surrounding  region,  and 
minority  and  low-income  populations.  This  section  assesses  the  impacts  of  these  building- 
related  activities  and  the  associated  workforce  on  the  region.  The  review  team  reviewed  the 
PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  and  verified  the  data  sources  used  in  its  preparation  by 
examining  cited  references  and  independently  confirming  data  in  discussions  with  community 
members  and  public  officials  (NRC  2012-TN2499).  To  verify  data  in  the  ER,  the  review  team 
requested  clarifications  and  additional  information  from  PSEG  as  needed.  Unless  otherwise 
specified  in  the  sections  below,  the  review  team  has  drawn  upon  verified  data  from  PSEG 
(PSEG  2012-TN2450;  PSEG  2012-TN2370).  Where  the  review  team  used  different  analytical 
methods  or  additional  information  for  its  own  analysis,  the  sections  include  explanatory 
discussions  and  citations  for  the  additional  sources.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Although  the  review  team  considered  the  entire  region  within  a  50-mi  radius  of  the  PSEG  Site 
when  assessing  socioeconomic  impacts,  because  of  expected  commuter  patterns,  the 
distribution  of  residential  communities  in  the  area,  and  the  likely  socioeconomic  impacts,  the 
review  team  identified  a  primary  economic  impact  area  composed  of  the  four  counties  nearest 
the  site — Salem,  Cumberland,  and  Gloucester  Counties  in  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle  County 
in  Delaware — as  the  area  with  the  greatest  potential  for  economic  impacts. 

Section  4.4.1  presents  a  summary  of  the  physical  impacts  of  the  project.  Section  4.4.2  provides 
a  description  of  the  demographic  impacts.  Section  4.4.3  describes  the  economic  impacts, 
including  impacts  on  the  local  and  state  economy  and  tax  revenues.  Section  4.4.4  describes 
the  impacts  on  infrastructure  and  community  services.  Section  4.4.5  summarizes  the 
socioeconomic  impacts  of  building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

4.4.1  Physical  Impacts 

Building  activities  can  cause  temporary  and  localized  physical  impacts  such  as  noise,  fugitive 
dust,  air  emissions,  and  visual  aesthetic  disturbances.  The  review  team  expects  these  impacts 
would  be  mitigated  by  compliance  with  all  applicable  Federal,  State,  and  local  environmental 
regulations  and  site-specific  permit  conditions.  All  of  the  mitigation  activities  discussed  below 
are  identified  in  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Vibration  and  shock  impacts  are  not 
expected  because  of  the  strict  control  of  blasting  and  other  shock-producing  activities.  This 
section  discusses  potential  impacts  on  people,  buildings,  and  roads  from  building  activities. 

4. 4. 7.7  Workers  and  the  Local  Public 

This  section  discusses  potential  impacts  of  air  emissions,  noise,  and  vibrations  on  workers, 
nearby  residents,  and  transient  visitors  to  the  immediate  area  around  the  PSEG  Site.  The 
proposed  PSEG  Site  is  located  adjacent  to  three  existing  nuclear  power  plants:  the  HCGS  unit 
and  SGS  Units  1  and  2  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The 
PSEG  Site  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  on  the  east  bank  of  the  Delaware 
River,  about  15  mi  south  of  the  Delaware  Memorial  Bridge,  18  mi  south  of  Wilmington, 

Delaware,  30  mi  southwest  of  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania,  and  7.5  mi  southwest  of  Salem,  New 
Jersey. 

The  nearest  residences  to  the  PSEG  Site  are  located  about  2.8  mi  to  the  west  in  New  Castle 
County,  Delaware,  and  about  3.4  mi  to  the  east-northeast  in  the  Hancock’s  Bridge  community  of 
Salem  County,  New  Jersey  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  closest  recreational  areas  are  the 
Augustine  Beach  Access  Area  and  Augustine  Wildlife  Area,  which  are  about  3.1  and  3.6  mi 
across  the  Delaware  River  from  the  PSEG  Site.  Because  of  these  distances  and  the  use  of 
BMPs,  residents  of  the  area  are  not  expected  to  experience  impacts  in  the  form  of  noise, 
vibrations,  or  fugitive  dust  associated  with  onsite  building  activities. 

Because  physical  impacts  attenuate  rapidly  with  distance,  onsite  workers  involved  in  building 
activities  for  a  new  plant  would  experience  the  most  direct  exposure  to  physical  impacts, 
followed  by  operational  workers  at  the  adjacent  HCGS  and  SGS.  The  welfare  of  construction 
and  operations  workers  is  regulated  by  the  Federal  Occupational  Safety  and  Health 
Administration  (OSHA).  The  use  of  heavy  equipment  for  batch  concrete  production,  excavation, 


November  2015 


4-55 


NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


drilling,  and  pile  driving  would  generate  noise,  fugitive  dust,  emissions,  and  vibrations  affecting 
both  the  building  site  and  neighboring  areas.  OSHA  requires  all  contractors,  vendors,  and  other 
parties  involved  in  building  a  new  plant  to  follow  BMPs  to  minimize  and  control  dust,  to  use 
personal  protective  equipment  and  masks  in  areas  of  high  dust,  to  properly  maintain  equipment 
to  minimize  harmful  emissions,  and  to  implement  safety  measures  such  as  protective  earplugs 
and  other  hearing  protection  to  reduce  noise  impacts  to  workers  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Most 
members  of  the  operational  workforce  at  HCGS  and  SGS  work  indoors  and  would  experience 
only  intermittent  exposure  to  the  increased  fugitive  dust,  emissions,  and  noise  associated  with 
building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Consequently,  the  review  team 
determined  the  physical  impacts  to  onsite  workers  to  be  minimal. 

Workers  involved  in  building  the  proposed  4.8-mi-long  causeway  would  be  less  likely  to 
experience  the  effects  of  fugitive  dust,  emissions,  noise,  and  vibrations  because  less  equipment 
and  fewer  materials  would  be  involved  in  these  efforts  and  most  of  the  work  would  occur  away 
from  the  PSEG  Site.  In  addition,  contractors  involved  in  these  activities  would  use  the  BMPs 
discussed  previously  to  minimize  impacts  on  the  workforce  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  According  to 
PSEG,  the  closest  residence  is  a  single  home  located  to  the  west  of  the  intersection  of  the 
causeway  and  Mason  Point  Road.  The  causeway  would  be  built  over  marshland  where  no  one 
resides,  reducing  any  potential  physical  impacts  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  review  team 
determined  that  physical  impacts  from  emissions,  noise,  and  fugitive  dust  during  causeway 
construction  would  be  minor  and  temporary. 

The  physical  impacts  to  the  workers  and  the  local  public  from  building  activities  at  the  PSEG 
Site  and  the  offsite  causeway  would  be  minimal  and  would  be  considered  an  annoyance  or 
nuisance,  and  no  further  mitigation  beyond  that  identified  by  the  applicant  in  its  ER  is  warranted. 

4. 4. 1.2  Noise 

The  main  sources  of  noise  during  building  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  from  earthmoving 
activities,  concrete  mixers,  cranes,  portable  generators,  pile  driving,  and  paving  breakers. 

These  activities  would  have  a  noise  level  of  80-88  dBA  at  50  ft  and  50-58  dBA  at  1 ,500  ft.  New 
Jersey  provides  regulatory  limits  for  continuous  noise  sources.  During  the  daytime,  New  Jersey 
has  a  65-dBA  limit  at  the  property  line  of  industrial  facilities.  New  Jersey  also  has  65-dBA  limits 
at  residential  property  lines  during  the  day  and  50-dBA  nighttime  limits.  Delaware  has  similar 
regulatory  limits  of  65  dBA  at  residential  property  lines  and  55-dBA  nighttime  limits.  The  closest 
residences  are  14,700  ft  west  and  15,900  ft  east  of  the  site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Because  of 
these  distances  and  regulatory  limits,  the  review  team  does  not  expect  residents  of  the  area  to 
experience  impacts  in  the  form  of  noise  during  preconstruction  or  construction  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
Projected  noise  impacts  from  operation  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  discussed  in  further  detail  in 
Section  4.8.2. 

4. 4. 1.3  Air  Quality 

Salem  County  is  administratively  in  the  Metropolitan  Philadelphia  Interstate  Air  Quality  Control 
Region  (40  CFR  Part  81-TN255)  and  is  in  attainment  with  the  National  Ambient  Air  Quality 
Standards  (NAAQSs)  (40  CFR  Part  50-TN1089)  for  all  criteria  pollutants  except  8-hour  ozone, 
for  which  Salem  County  is  in  nonattainment.  Temporary  and  minor  effects  on  local  ambient  air 


NUREG-2168 


4-56 


November  2015 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


quality  would  occur  as  a  result  of  building  activities.  Dust  particle  emissions  would  be  generated 
during  land-clearing,  grading,  and  excavation  activities.  Air  quality  would  also  be  affected  by 
engine  exhaust  emissions  and  concrete  batch  plant  operations.  PSEG  would  create  emission- 
specific  strategies  and  measures  to  comply  with  the  NAAQS  (40  CFR  Part  50-TN1089)  and  the 
National  Emission  Standards  for  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants  (40  CFR  Part  63-TN1403).  PSEG 
indicates  it  would  create  a  dust  control  program  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Also,  PSEG  would 
need  to  acquire  a  New  Jersey  State  Construction  Air  Permit.  In  addition,  it  is  not  known  at  this 
time  whether  an  air  mitigation  plan  will  be  required  for  this  project  to  conform  to  the  state 
implementation  plan. 

The  review  team  understands  that  some  emissions  from  building  activities  are  unavoidable,  but 
the  physical  impacts  from  building  activities  would  be  minimal  and  maintained  within  regulatory 
limits.  Therefore,  mitigation  beyond  that  identified  by  the  applicant  in  its  ER  is  not  warranted. 
Further  discussion  about  air  quality  in  this  EIS  is  in  Section  4.7. 

4. 4. 1.4  Buildings 

Building  activities  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  be  likely  to  affect  any  offsite  buildings,  primarily 
because  of  the  distance  separating  the  site  from  other  development.  As  noted  previously,  the 
nearest  residence  is  located  2.8  mi  from  the  site.  The  nearest  industrial  and  commercial 
buildings  are  located  farther  away  and  would  also  not  be  affected  by  onsite  building  activities 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  structures  with  the  greatest  potential  to  be  affected  by  building  activities  associated  with  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  the  existing  facilities  at  HCGS  and  SGS, 
which  could  experience  vibration-related  impacts  associated  with  pile-driving  activities.  PSEG 
indicates  that  building  activities  would  be  planned,  reviewed,  and  conducted  in  a  manner  that 
ensures  no  adverse  effect  on  operations  at  HCGS  and  SGS  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  In 
accordance  with  10  CFR  Part  50,  Appendix  A  (TN249),  HCGS  and  SGS  have  been  built  to 
safely  withstand  shock  and  vibration  from  activities  associated  with  development  at  the  PSEG 
Site.  The  review  team  expects  that  these  measures  would  avoid  impacts  to  existing  structures 
on  the  PSEG  Site.  Buildings  along  the  proposed  causeway  route  include  a  PSEG 
environmental  project  office  and  one  residence  located  at  the  causeway’s  northern  terminus. 
This  portion  of  the  causeway  would  consist  of  the  at-grade  widening  of  the  existing  Money 
Island  Road.  Any  pile-driving,  blasting,  or  other  activities  that  create  significant  vibration  would 
occur  over  marshland,  not  along  the  at-grade  areas  near  the  residence  on  Mason  Point  Road 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  review  team  expects  that  no  structures  would  be  removed  to 
accomplish  this  widening,  and  the  required  work  activities  in  this  location  would  not  generate 
significant  vibrations. 

In  summary,  the  review  team  concludes  that  development  activities  associated  with  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  associated  causeway  would  not  affect  offsite 
buildings  and  that  impacts  to  buildings  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minimized  through  design 
and  construction  practices.  Thus,  the  impact  of  plant  development  on  buildings  would  be 
minimal,  and  no  mitigation  beyond  that  identified  by  the  applicant  in  its  ER  would  be  warranted.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


4. 4. 1.5  Transportation 
Roads 

Building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  affect  existing  roads  and  traffic  volumes  in  two  ways: 
the  addition  of  the  proposed  causeway  would  alter  traffic  patterns  in  the  area,  and  construction 
workers  and  other  traffic  related  to  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  the  causeway  would  increase 
traffic  on  the  local  roadway  network.  Section  2. 5.2.3  describes  the  local  transportation  network 
around  the  PSEG  Site,  and  Figure  2-23  depicts  the  road  and  highway  system  in  Salem  County. 

The  effects  of  the  proposed  causeway  on  local  traffic  patterns  would  be  experienced  primarily 
on  the  roads  that  connect  the  new  route  to  major  State  highways  (New  Jersey  State  Routes  45 
and  49)  in  the  vicinity  of  Salem.  In  addition,  vehicular  traffic  volumes  in  the  area  would  increase 
due  to  construction  workers  and  delivery  trucks  driving  to  and  from  the  PSEG  Site  each  day  and 
the  additional  personal  travel  by  in-migrating  workers  and  their  families.  Given  the  size  of  the 
resulting  increases  in  traffic  volumes,  it  is  likely  that  building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  would 
have  noticeable  physical  impacts  on  some  roads  in  the  economic  impact  area,  particularly  those 
providing  access  to  the  proposed  causeway,  including  Money  Island  Road,  Amwellbury  Road, 
Mason  Point  Road,  Fort  Elfsborg  Road,  Walnut  Street,  Hancocks  Bridge  Road,  and  Grieves 
Parkway.  These  impacts  could  warrant  increased  road  repairs  and  maintenance  and  cause 
additional  traffic  congestion  in  some  areas.  The  majority  of  road  degradation  would  occur  in 
Salem  County  and  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township.  Both  have  local  ordinances  that  require 
the  entity  contributing  to  the  degradation  to  provide  resources  to  improve  roadways 
(PSEG  2012-TN2370).  Elsinboro  Township  would  also  experience  some  road  degradation,  but 
the  township  has  similar  land  ordinances  (Salem  County  2013-TN2628).  Consequently,  due  to 
the  mitigating  aspect  from  local  ordinances,  the  review  team  considers  the  physical  impacts  to 
roads  from  building  to  be  minimal,  and  mitigation  beyond  that  identified  by  the  applicant  in  its 
ER  is  not  warranted.  Section  4.4.4. 1  discusses  the  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the  additional 
vehicular  traffic  on  local  roads  and  highways  in  the  context  of  existing  traffic  volumes,  road  and 
intersection  capacities,  and  level  of  service  (LOS). 

Water 

As  discussed  in  Section  2. 5. 2. 3,  there  is  an  existing  barge  facility  at  the  HCGS  site.  To  support 
delivery  of  large  components  and  equipment  for  building,  PSEG  indicated  that  the  existing 
barge  facility  at  HCGS  would  need  to  be  modified  and  a  parallel  barge  facility,  built  to  regulatory 
requirements,  would  need  to  be  constructed.  The  barge  slips  and  the  expected  barge  deliveries 
are  expected  to  have  a  negligible  impact  on  river  traffic  on  the  Delaware  River. 

Rail 

There  are  no  railroads  within  about  7  mi  of  the  site  (NRC  201 1-TN3131).  PSEG  has  not 
indicated  that  it  would  extend  a  rail  line  to  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review  team  expects  no  impacts 
to  rail  lines  in  the  area. 


NUREG-2168

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


4. 4. 1.6  Aesthetics 

Because  of  the  distance  to  occupied  areas,  activities  associated  with  building  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  visible  primarily  to  workers  on  the  site,  including 
operational  workers  at  HCGS  and  SGS.  Aesthetic  impacts  to  offsite  areas  would  occur  mainly 
as  a  result  of  the  introduction  of  large  new  elements,  including  cooling  towers,  reactor  domes, 
and  an  elevated  causeway,  into  the  visual  environment. 

Because  of  the  unobstructed  view,  boaters  on  the  Delaware  River  and  residents  and 
recreationists  near  the  river  in  New  Castle  County,  Delaware,  can  clearly  see  the  512-ft  HCGS 
cooling  tower,  the  three  reactor  domes  associated  with  HCGS  and  SGS,  and  smaller  structures 
on  the  PSEG  Site.  Residents  of  nearby  portions  of  Salem  County  (primarily  the  Hancocks 
Bridge  community)  and  recreationists  using  the  Abbotts  Meadow  WMA  are  mainly  able  to  see 
the  HCGS  cooling  tower,  although  the  tops  of  the  HCGS  and  SGS  reactor  domes  are  also 
visible  from  some  locations.  Figure  3-1  shows  the  current  layout  of  the  HCGS  and  SGS  sites 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

The  majority  of  building  activities  would  not  be  visible  off  the  site.  However,  building  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  eventually  add  to  the 
industrial  character  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  principal  visual  features  added  by  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  would  be  cooling  towers  (up  to  590-ft  tall),  reactor  buildings,  and  the  elevated 
causeway.  Under  Federal  Aviation  Administration  regulations,  the  cooling  towers  would  be 
appropriately  marked  with  lighting,  making  them  visible  during  nighttime  hours.  The  elevated 
causeway  would  be  a  dominant  feature  in  the  view  from  the  Money  Island  Road  viewing 
platform,  as  is  likely  to  also  be  the  case  in  the  immediately  adjacent  Abbotts  Meadow  WMA, 
which  receives  recreational  use  for  hunting  and  bird  watching. 

Even  though  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  causeway  would  be  in  keeping  with  the  industrial 
character  of  the  existing  PSEG  Site,  the  increased  intensity  of  the  visual  presence  of  structures 
on  the  site  plus  the  introduction  of  the  elevated  causeway  as  a  dominant  visual  element  in  a 
sensitive  recreational  location  would  constitute  a  noticeable,  but  not  destabilizing,  impact.  This 
impact  would  be  due  to  the  essential  character  of  the  new  structures  and  would  not  be 
amenable  to  mitigation  measures. 

4. 4. 1.7  Summary  of  Physical  Impacts 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  evaluation  and 
outreach,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  physical  impacts  of  building-related  activities  on 
workers  and  the  local  public  from  noise;  on  air  quality;  and  on  buildings  would  be  SMALL,  and 
no  mitigation  beyond  that  proposed  by  PSEG  would  be  warranted.  The  physical  impacts  on  the 
road  network  during  building  would  be  MODERATE.  As  discussed  in  Section  4. 4. 1.5,  PSEG 
would  provide  resources  to  mitigate  road  degradation  near  the  site.  The  addition  of  new  cooling 
towers  and  new  reactor  domes  at  the  PSEG  Site,  and  the  proposed  causeway  that  traverses 
the  EEP  area,  would  noticeably  affect  the  aesthetic  qualities  from  viewpoints  in  New  Castle  and 
Salem  Counties.  Thus,  the  review  team  concludes  that  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and 
causeway  would  have  a  MODERATE  physical  impact  on  aesthetic  resources  and  that  the 
impacts  would  not  be  amenable  to  mitigation. 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Based  on  the  above  information,  the  review  team  determined  the  impacts  of  NRC-authorized 
construction  activities  on  the  physical  aspects  of  the  affected  environment  for  MODERATE 
impact  categories  (roads  and  aesthetics)  would  also  be  MODERATE. 

4.4.2  Demography 

PSEG  estimates  that  preconstruction  activities  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant, 
including  site-preparation  work  and  building  the  proposed  causeway,  would  begin  in  the  second 
quarter  of  2015  and  last  about  24  months  (i.e.,  until  the  second  quarter  of  2017)  (PSEG  2012- 
TN1489).  In  ER  Section  4.4.1 .1 .1 .2.1 ,  PSEG  estimates  that  no  more  than  10  percent  of  the 
peak  construction  workforce  (no  more  than  410  workers)  would  be  needed  to  construct  the 
causeway  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  workforce  to  build  roads  in  New  Jersey  is  typically  trade 
union  labor.  There  are  sufficient  numbers  of  these  workers  available  within  a  reasonable 
commuting  distance  to  commute  daily  into  and  out  of  the  area.  The  review  team  expects  a 
negligible  demographic  impact  from  the  workforce  for  the  causeway. 

The  NRC-authorized  construction  activities  on  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  begin  in  the 
fourth  quarter  of  2016  and  be  completed  in  the  third  quarter  of  2021  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
PSEG  has  not  selected  a  reactor  technology,  but  using  the  workforce  requirements  for  two 
Advanced  Passive  1000  (API 000)  reactors,  PSEG  estimates  that  4,100  workers  would  be 
required  during  the  period  when  construction  activities  were  at  their  peak  (PSEG  2012-TN2450). 
Table  4-4  presents  the  number  of  workers  that  would  be  required  during  each  month  of  the 
construction  period.  For  most  socioeconomic  resources,  the  review  team  analyzed  only  the 
impacts  of  the  peak  construction  employment  period  as  an  upper  bound  to  potential  impacts, 
recognizing  that  impacts  would  likely  be  smaller  during  the  rest  of  the  building  period. 

Of  the  4,1 00  workers  required  at  peak  employment  to  build  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  PSEG 
estimates  that  2,870  (70  percent)  would  be  construction  trade  workers  and  the  remaining 
1 ,230  (30  percent)  would  be  nontrade  workers  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  largest  trade 
workforce  requirements  would  be  for  electricians  and  instrument  fitters  (12.0  percent),  structural 
steel  and  iron  workers  (12.0  percent),  and  pipefitters  (11.0  percent).  PSEG  estimates  that  most 
of  the  nontrade  workers  would  be  employed  during  the  construction  period  to  support  building 
activities  through  vending  and  subcontracting,  engineering  and  procurement,  indirect  support 
labor,  and  startup  activities. 

According  to  an  NRC  study  released  in  1981  (Malhotra  and  Manninen  1981-TN1430),  about 
15  to  35  percent  of  the  trade  and  nontrade  workforce  involved  in  building  nuclear  power  plants 
come  from  outside  the  50-mi  region  surrounding  the  plants.  The  study  also  found  that  trade 
workers  generally  drew  from  a  large  labor  force  within  the  region  and  had  lower  rates  of 
relocation  from  outside.  Nontrade  workers  and  specific  trades  that  were  not  well  represented  in 
the  region  were  found  to  have  higher  rates  of  relocation  from  outside  the  region.

Because  of  the  large  labor  force  available  within  the  50-mi  region  of  the  PSEG  Site,  which 
includes  much  of  the  Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington  metropolitan  area,  and  based  on  PSEG 
experience  with  HCGS  and  SGS  construction,  the  review  team  believes  that  most  of  the 
workers  required  to  build  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  drawn  from  the  labor  force  within 
the  region.  These  workers  would  maintain  their  current  residences  and  commute  to  the  work 
site. 

However,  the  number  of  boilermakers  (103  workers)  and  iron  workers  (495  workers)  required  to 
build  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  is  large  compared  to  the  number  of  such  workers  available  in 
the  regional  labor  force  (596  and  2,289  workers,  respectively)  (DDOL  2013-TN2421; 

MDDLLR  201 1-TN2422;  NJLWD-TN2423).  PSEG  estimates  that  these  specialty  workers  would 
be  required  from  the  second  quarter  of  201 8  through  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021 ,  a  period  of 
about  45  months  (PSEG  2012-TN2450).  Because  boilermakers  and  iron  workers  are  likely  to 
be  in  demand  by  other  construction  projects  in  the  region,  the  review  team  conservatively 
estimates  that  only  10  percent  of  the  regional  labor  force  in  these  two  specialties  would  be

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


available  to  support  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Thus,  the  review 
team  expects  that  the  region  would  supply  60  boilermakers  and  229  iron  workers,  and  that  the 
remaining  43  boilermakers  (103  minus  60)  and  266  iron  workers  (495  minus  229)  would  come 
from  outside  the  50-mi  region.  This  would  result  in  the  in-migration  of  a  total  of  309  trade 
workers  from  outside  the  region. 

The  NRC  study  of  migration  of  nuclear  power  plant  workers  (Malhotra  and  Manninen  1981- 
TN1430)  found  that  nontrade  workers  were  more  likely  than  trade  workers  to  migrate  from 
outside  the  50-mi  region.  However,  because  of  the  large  labor  force  in  the  Philadelphia 
metropolitan  area,  many  of  the  needed  nontrade  workers  are  likely  to  be  available  within  the 
PSEG  region.  The  review  team  concludes  that  it  is  not  unreasonable  to  expect  that  25  percent 
(the  midpoint  of  the  range  identified  by  the  NRC  study)  of  the  nontrade  workers  (or  308  workers) 
would  migrate  into  the  region  to  support  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
The  nontrade  workers  also  include  the  operations  and  maintenance  staff  and  startup  personnel, 
who  would  be  on  the  site  during  the  operations  period.  Socioeconomic  impacts  from  operations 
are  discussed  in  Section  5.4  of  this  EIS. 

In  summary,  the  review  team  expects  that  at  peak  construction  a  total  of  617  trade  and  nontrade 
workers  would  migrate  into  the  50-mi  region  surrounding  the  PSEG  Site  to  support  building  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant.  This  is  similar  to  PSEG’s  estimate  of  634  workers.  This  represents 
about  1 5  percent  of  the  peak  workforce,  a  figure  that  is  at  the  low  end  of  the  range  identified  by 
the  1981  NRC  study  (Malhotra  and  Manninen  1981-TN1430).  The  review  team  believes  that 
this  relatively  low  proportion  of  in-migrating  workers  is  not  unreasonable  because  of  the  large 
existing  and  forecast  labor  force  within  the  region.  Workforce  requirements  for  building  activities 
at  the  PSEG  Site  are  detailed  in  Table  4-5. 

Not  all  in-migrating  workers  would  bring  families  when  they  relocate  to  the  area;  however,  to 
provide  an  upper  bound  for  assessing  impacts,  the  review  team  assumes  that  every  worker 
would  be  accompanied  by  household  members.  The  average  household  size  is  2.55  people  in 
Delaware  and  2.68  people  in  New  Jersey  (USCB  201 1-TN2424).  To  ensure  that  the  upper 
bound  of  impacts  is  identified,  the  review  team  uses  the  higher  household  size  figure  for  New 
Jersey  to  estimate  that  a  total  of  1,654  people  (workers  and  their  household  members)  would 
move  into  the  region  at  peak  employment  while  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  is  being  built.  This  is 
similar  to  PSEG’s  estimate  of  1 ,712  in-migrating  persons. 

In-migrating  workers  and  their  families  are  likely  to  choose  to  live  in  locations  that  allow 
convenient  access  to  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  the  review  team  assumes  that  all  of  these 
workers  would  reside  within  the  economic  impact  area.  This  assumption  provides  an  upper 
bound  on  socioeconomic  impacts  by  concentrating  the  additional  population  within  the 
economic  impact  area.  PSEG  records  indicate  that,  of  current  HCGS  and  SGS  employees  who 
live  in  the  economic  impact  area,  12.1  percent  reside  in  Cumberland  County,  17.7  percent  in 
Gloucester  County,  49.6  percent  in  Salem  County,  and  20.6  in  New  Castle  County 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  review  team  assumes  that  in-migrating  workers  involved  in  building 
a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  follow  this  distribution  pattern.  The  resulting  increase  in 
population  within  the  economic  impact  area  is  summarized  in  Table  4-6.  The  in-migration  of 
workers  and  their  families  to  support  building  a  new  plant  would  increase  the  population  of  the 
economic  impact  area  by  less  than  about  two-tenths  of  1  percent.  The  increase  would  be  most

pronounced  in  Salem  County,  which  would  experience  about  a  1.21  percent  increase  in 
population.  These  estimates  are  during  peak  construction  and  would  be  less  during  other  times 
of  the  building  phase  and  constitute  minimal  increases  to  the  counties  in  the  economic  impact 
area.

Of  the  3,483  workers  that  are  from  the  region,  some  would  have  been  unemployed  prior  to 
building  activities.  In  March  2013,  the  national  unemployment  rate  for  the  construction  industry 
was  14.7  percent  (BLS  2013-TN2482).  Of  the  workforce  that  would  not  in-migrate,  the  review 
team  assumes  that  512  would  have  been  previously  unemployed.  Assuming  a  similar 
distribution  to  the  in-migrating  workforce,  20.6  percent  of  the  unemployed  workers  would 
already  reside  in  New  Castle  County  (105  workers),  while  79.4  percent  would  already  reside  in 
the  New  Jersey  counties  of  the  economic  impact  area.  About  62  workers  would  be  hired  in 
Cumberland  County,  88  in  Gloucester  County,  and  254  in  Salem  County.  In  the  economic 
impact  area,  1 ,129  jobs  would  have  been  filled  between  unemployed  workers  and  in-migrating 
workers. 

The  review  team  concludes  that  the  increased  levels  of  population  would  not  noticeably  affect 
the  demographic  character  of  the  economic  impact  area  or  any  of  its  counties  and  therefore  that 
the  impact  would  be  SMALL. 

4.4.3  Economic  Impacts  to  the  Community 

This  section  evaluates  the  economic  and  tax  impacts  on  the  50-mi  region  from  building  activities 
at  the  PSEG  Site,  focusing  primarily  on  Salem,  Cumberland,  and  Gloucester  Counties  in  New 
Jersey,  and  New  Castle  County  in  Delaware.  The  evaluation  assesses  the  impacts  and 
demands  from  the  workforce  for  building  at  the  PSEG  Site.  As  indicated  in  Section  4.4.2,  the 
review  team  assumes  617  workers  (about  1 5  percent  of  the  peak  construction  workforce)  would 
migrate  into  the  economic  impact  area.  Assuming  a  family  size  of  2.68,  the  review  team 
assumes  about  1,654  people  would  move  into  the  economic  impact  area. 

4.4.3. 7  Economy 

Direct  employment  for  large  industrial  or  infrastructure  projects  typically  benefits  the  local 
economy.  Each  direct  job  stimulates  spending  on  goods  and  services,  resulting  in  the  creation 
of  indirect  jobs.  PSEG  has  not  selected  a  reactor  technology,  but  for  the  purposes  of  this 
analysis,  the  review  team  assumes  two  API  000  reactors  with  an  output  of  2,200  MW(e).  This  is 
the  same  technology  PSEG  used  to  estimate  workforce  requirements  (PSEG  2012-TN2450).  In 
Section  3.2  of  this  EIS,  the  PPE  is  based  on  four  reactor  technologies.  The  API  000  has  the 
largest  output  in  megawatts  (electrical)  and  the  largest  workforce  of  the  four  technologies. 


NUREG-2168

November  2015 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Studies  of  new  power  plant  construction  indicate  that  the  estimated  construction  costs  of  a 
nuclear  power  plant  average  about  $4,000  per  kW(e)  in  2007  dollars  (MIT  2009-TN2481 ).  In 
2013,  the  inflation-adjusted  amount  would  be  $4,490.61  per  kW(e),  using  the  Bureau  of  Labor 
Statistics  Consumer  Price  Index  Inflation  Calculator.  Using  these  assumptions,  the  review  team 
assumes  a  planned  capacity  of  2,200  MW(e)  would  cost  about  $9,879  billion  in  2013  dollars. 

Given  the  highly  specialized  nature  of  nuclear  power  plant  components,  a  large  portion  of  the 
project’s  materials  and  equipment  would  be  imported  from  outside  the  region.  However,  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  would  require  substantial  amounts  of  bulk  materials  and  supplies  (including 
concrete,  steel  piping,  wiring,  and  electrical  components),  some  of  which  could  be  procured 
locally.  Because  PSEG  has  not  selected  a  reactor  technology,  it  projected  the  expected 
purchases  of  materials  based  on  purchases  during  operations  from  2005-2008  at  HCGS  and 
SGS.  These  estimates  are  in  Table  4-7.  The  review  team’s  estimates  in  Table  4-7  are  a 
reasonable  estimate  for  the  counties  within  the  economic  impact  area  based  on  the  past  history 
with  HCGS  and  SGS,  the  review  team’s  experience  with  other  licensing  reviews,  and  the 
characteristics  of  the  economy  in  the  economic  impact  area.  However,  the  estimates  for 
purchases  outside  of  the  economic  impact  area  represent  an  upper  bound  because  the  table 
assumes  all  purchases  of  supplies  and  services  would  be  made  in  the  United  States.  These 
estimates  may  be  adjusted  once  the  reactor  technology  and  construction  plan  are  finalized 
by  PSEG.

other  sectors  of  the  local  economy  at  vendors  and  shops  that  provide  materials  and  supplies  for

the  building  phase.  The  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  Bureau  of  Economic  Analysis  (BEA),

team  obtained  multipliers  from  the  BEA  for  the  economic  impact  area.  For  every  million  dollars 
spent  by  PSEG  on  purchases  of  services,  materials,  and  supplies,  10.7063  jobs  would  be 
supported  in  the  economic  impact  area  (BEA  2013-TN2594).  The  annual  spending  on  services, 
materials,  and  supplies  would  support  about  512  additional  jobs  in  the  economic  impact  area. 

In  addition  to  the  purchases  of  materials,  supplies,  and  services,  direct  employment  for  the 
building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  benefit  the  local  economy.  The  size  of  the 
construction  workforce  needed  for  PSEG  would  range  from  a  minimum  of  208  workers  to  a 
maximum  of  4,100.  Assuming  a  68-month  construction  cycle,  the  average  number  of  workers 
would  be  2,722  workers. 

The  types  of  construction  workers  that  would  be  used  on  the  project  and  the  number  of 
construction  workers  in  the  economic  impact  area  are  discussed  in  Section  4.4.2  of  this  EIS. 

The  annual  mean  wage  in  May  2012  for  a  Construction  and  Extraction  worker  (U.S.  Department 
of  Labor,  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics,  Standard  Occupational  Classification  code  470000)  in  the 
Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington  Metropolitan  Statistical  Area  was  $52,200  (BLS  2012- 
TN2483).  Although  the  size  of  the  building  workforce  and  associated  payroll  spending  would 
vary  depending  on  the  building  schedule  and  mobilization  each  particular  year,  assuming  an 
average  of  2,722  workers  per  year,  the  review  team  estimates  that  PSEG  would  spend  an 
average  of  $142  million  annually,  in  2012  dollars,  on  payroll  during  building.  At  peak 
construction,  this  number  rises  to  $214  million. 

As  discussed  in  Section  4.4.2,  most  of  these  wages  would  be  paid  to  construction  workers 
residing  in  the  economic  impact  area.  A  total  of  617  workers  are  expected  to  move  into  the 
economic  impact  area  at  peak  construction.  These  617  workers  would  receive  an  estimated 
annual  total  of  $32.21  million  in  compensation.  PSEG  would  hire  about  512  previously 
unemployed  construction  workers  who  would  receive  a  total  of  $26.72  million  in  compensation. 
This  total  would  be  $58.93  million  for  the  1 , 1 29  newly  hired  workers  in  the  economic  impact  area. 

New  workers  have  an  additional  indirect  effect  on  the  local  economy  because  they  stimulate  the 
local  economy  by  their  spending  on  goods  and  services  in  other  industries.  This  spending 
results  in  economic  demand  for  a  fraction  of  another  indirect  job.  The  review  team  obtained 
multipliers  from  the  BEA  for  the  economic  impact  area.  The  review  team  did  not  include 
workers  who  are  currently  employed  that  would  be  employed  at  the  PSEG  Site  because  their 
direct  and  indirect  effects  are  already  included  in  the  economic  impact  area  baseline. 

In  the  economic  impact  area,  BEA  estimates  that  for  every  new  construction  job  created,  an 
additional  0.8224  jobs  are  created  in  the  economic  impact  area  (BEA  201 3-TN2594).  According 
to  the  analysis  above,  PSEG  would  hire  617  in-migrating  workers  and  512  unemployed  workers 
during  the  peak  building  period,  or  1,129  newly  employed  workers.  These  1,129  direct  jobs 
would  result  in  928  indirect  jobs  created  (1 , 1 29  *  0.8224).  For  the  purposes  of  this  analysis,  the 
review  team  expects  these  workers  to  already  reside  in  the  economic  impact  area.  The 
estimated  impacts  to  each  county  are  listed  in  Table  4-8.  BEA  also  estimates  the  indirect 
earnings  multiplier  in  the  economic  impact  area.  This  multiplier  was  applied  to  the  wages  of 


NUREG-2168

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


new  workers  to  determine  the  effect  of  direct  earnings  on  the  local  economy.  For  every  dollar  of 
wages  earned  by  new  workers  during  peak  construction,  BEA  estimates  an  additional  $0.6926 
in  income  would  be  added  in  the  economic  impact  area.  The  $58.93  million  annual 
compensation  at  peak  construction  from  the  newly  hired  workers  would  lead  to  an  estimated 
$40.91  million  in  annual  indirect  wages  ($59.93  million  *  0.6926)  (BEA  2013-TN2594). 

Given  the  size  of  the  economies  and  workforces  in  the  economic  impact  area,  the  review  team 
estimates  the  impact  of  building  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minor,  and  positive,  except  in  Salem 
County  where  there  would  be  noticeable  and  beneficial  impacts  from  hiring  previously 
unemployed  direct  and  indirect  workers  and  from  local  spending  on  materials  and  supplies.

4. 4. 3. 2  Taxes 

The  tax  structure  for  the  economic  impact  area  and  region  is  discussed  in  Section  2.52.2  of  this 
EIS.  Primary  tax  revenues  associated  with  building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  from 
(1)  State  and  local  taxes  on  worker  incomes,  (2)  State  sales  taxes  on  worker  expenditures, 

(3)  State  sales  taxes  on  the  purchases  of  materials  and  supplies,  (4)  corporate  taxes,  and 
(5)  local  property  taxes  or  payments  in  lieu  of  taxes  based  on  the  assessed  value  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  during  building. 

State  and  Local  Income  Taxes 

Delaware  and  New  Jersey  would  receive  additional  income  tax  revenue  from  the  income  tax  on 
wages  of  new  workers.  Table  4-9  summarizes  the  estimated  new  income  tax  revenue  that 
would  be  received  by  the  two  states  during  peak  building.  The  exact  amount  of  income  tax 
revenue  is  determined  on  the  basis  of  many  factors  such  as  rates,  residency  status,  deductions, 
and  other  factors.  These  income  tax  revenues  would  be  smaller  in  nonpeak  building  years.

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


The  majority  of  the  building  workforce  would  already  live  in  the  region,  would  commute  daily 
to  and  from  the  site,  and  would  not  have  been  unemployed  elsewhere  prior  to  building 
activities  at  the  PSEG  Site.  For  the  purposes  of  this  analysis,  the  review  team  assumes  that  all 
1,129  workers  (unemployed  and  in-migrating)  would  live  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  would 
pay  income  taxes.  Of  these  workers,  232  would  pay  income  tax  in  Delaware  and  897  would  pay 
income  tax  in  New  Jersey.  They  would  provide  $0.89  million  and  $2.94  million  additional 
income  tax  revenue  to  Delaware  and  New  Jersey,  respectively.  This  is  about  a  nine  one- 
hundredths  of  1  percent  increase  in  Delaware  and  less  than  a  three  one-hundredths  of 
1  percent  increase  in  New  Jersey  compared  to  201 1  revenue.  The  indirect  workers  created 
from  the  building  workforce  would  contribute  further,  yet  minimal,  revenue  to  the  states.  As 
discussed  in  Section  4.4.2,  about  410  workers  would  be  needed  to  build  the  causeway.  These 
workers  would  already  reside  in  the  50-mi  region  and  pay  income  taxes  to  Delaware  and  New 
Jersey.  Because  the  size  of  the  causeway  workforce  is  10  percent  of  the  peak  building 
workforce,  its  impacts  to  State  revenue  would  be  minimal. 

PSEG  pays  an  energy  receipts  tax  to  the  State  of  New  Jersey  based  on  revenues  from 
electricity  sales.  However,  because  PSEG  would  not  sell  electricity  from  a  new  plant  during 
building,  the  energy  receipts  tax  would  not  change  from  the  baseline  tax  payments  to  New 
Jersey.  Consequently,  the  review  team  expects  the  impact  from  extra  income  taxes  on  State 
revenue  would  be  minimal  and  beneficial. 

State  Sales  Taxes  on  Worker  Expenditures 

Workers  would  spend  some  of  their  income  on  goods  and  services  that  may  be  taxed.  New 
Jersey  imposes  a  7  percent  sales  tax;  however,  Delaware  does  not  impose  a  sales  tax.  No 
localities  in  the  economic  impact  area  impose  an  additional  sales  tax.  Because  Delaware 
imposes  no  sales  tax  and  New  Jersey’s  201 1  revenue  from  sales  taxes  was  more  than 
$1 1  billion,  the  review  team  expects  a  minimal,  beneficial  impact  on  State  sales  tax  revenue 
from  in-migrating,  previously  unemployed,  and  indirect  worker  expenditures. 

State  Sales  Taxes  on  Materials  and  Supplies 

Section  4.4.3. 1  discusses  the  review  team’s  estimates  of  PSEG  expenditures  in  the  economic 
impact  area,  region,  and  beyond  during  building.  These  expenditures  may  be  subject  to  sales 
taxes.  New  Jersey  and  Pennsylvania  have  sales  taxes  of  7  and  6  percent,  respectively. 
Delaware  does  not  impose  sales  taxes.  Some  localities  in  New  Jersey  and  Pennsylvania 
impose  additional  sales  taxes  (e.g.,  Philadelphia  County  imposes  an  extra  2  percent  sales  tax). 
However,  none  in  the  economic  impact  area  impose  extra  sales  taxes.  The  distribution  of 
expenditures  across  the  localities  is  not  known. 

During  building,  the  review  team  estimates  about  $1  billion  a  year  would  be  spent  in  New  Jersey 
and  $500  million  in  Pennsylvania.  These  expenditures  would  bring  in  almost  $73  million  and 
$30  million  in  sales  tax  revenue  in  New  Jersey  and  Pennsylvania,  respectively  (Table  4-10). 
These  estimates  are  also  an  upper  bound  because,  as  discussed  in  Section  4. 4. 3.1,  the  review 
team  assumes  all  expenditures  during  building  would  be  in  Pennsylvania,  New  Jersey,  and 
Delaware.  These  would  account  for  a  six-tenths  of  1  percent  and  almost  a  two-tenths  of 
1  percent  increase  in  New  Jersey  and  Pennsylvania  sales  tax  revenues,  respectively.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Therefore,  the  review  team  believes  that  there  would  be  a  minimal,  positive  impact  on  sales  tax 
revenues  during  building.

Property  Taxes 

Property  taxes  that  would  be  paid  during  the  building  phase  by  construction  workers  that  are 
already  living  in  the  area  are  a  part  of  the  baseline  and  not  relevant  to  this  analysis. 

In-migrating  workers  would  most  likely  move  into  existing  houses  rather  than  constructing  new 
houses.  Thus,  the  in-migrating  workforce  would  result  in  a  transfer  of  property  taxes  instead  of 
an  increase  in  local  property  tax  revenues.  Based  on  the  above  assessments,  the  review  team 
determined  there  would  be  minor  property  tax  impacts  from  construction  workers. 

In  personal  interviews  with  administrators  in  Salem  County  and  Lower  Alloways  Creek 
Township,  the  review  team  discovered  that  no  property  tax  is  assessed  against  construction 
projects  in  progress.  PSEG  would  not  pay  property  taxes  to  Salem  County  until  the  new  plant  is 
completed  and  commercial  operations  are  started  (NRC  2012-TN2499). 

From  the  above  assessments,  the  review  team  determined  there  would  be  minor  construction- 
phase  property  tax  impacts  in  the  economic  impact  area. 

4. 4. 3. 3  Summary  of  Economic  Impacts  to  the  Community 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  evaluation  and 
outreach,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  economic  and  tax  impacts  would  be  SMALL  and 
beneficial  for  the  region  and  the  economic  impact  area,  with  the  exception  of  MODERATE  and 
beneficial  economic  impacts  in  Salem  County.  The  increased  benefits  to  Salem  County  would 
be  from  the  hiring  of  unemployed  direct  and  indirect  workers  and  from  PSEG  spending  on 
supplies  and  materials  at  local  shops  and  vendors.  Tax  revenue  to  local  jurisdictions  would 
accrue  through  personal  income,  sales,  and  property  taxes. 

4.4.4  Infrastructure  and  Community  Service  Impacts 

This  section  provides  the  estimated  impacts  on  infrastructure  and  community  services,  including 
transportation,  recreation,  housing,  public  services,  and  education. 

4. 4. 4. 7  Traffic 

Existing  transportation  routes  would  be  affected  by  the  transportation  of  equipment,  materials, 
supplies,  and  the  construction  workforce  to  the  PSEG  Site.  The  PSEG  Site  can  be  accessed 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


via  roads  and  the  Delaware  River,  and  both  modes  would  likely  be  used  during  building 
activities.  Large  components  and  equipment  would  be  transported  by  barge  via  the  Delaware 
River.  PSEG  plans  to  use  the  existing  HCGS  barge  facility  and  construct  a  new  barge  facility 
parallel  to  the  one  near  the  PSEG  Site  (EIS  Section  3.3.1 ).  Building-related  traffic  would 
primarily  use  the  proposed  causeway  to  avoid  disruptions  to  the  HCGS  and  SGS  workforce 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Personal  vehicles  and  trucks  on  roadways  would  be  the  primary 
transportation  mode  for  the  construction  workforce  and  would  affect  the  LOS  on  local  roadways, 
particularly  during  the  peak  building  period.  LOS  is  a  measure  of  time  delays  at  signalized  and 
unsignalized  intersections  ranked  from  A  to  F  based  on  delay  times  (Table  4-1 1 ).  The  lower 
value  of  each  noted  LOS  range  is  for  unsignalized  intersections,  and  the  higher  value  is  for 
signalized  intersections  (PSEG  2013-TN2525).

The  road  system  in  the  economic  impact  area  is  described  in  Section  2. 5. 2. 3.  Physical  impacts 
on  the  local  transportation  network  from  building  are  discussed  in  Section  4. 4. 1.5.  The  size  of 
the  workforce  would  vary  over  an  estimated  8-year  building  period  from  a  minimum  of 
208  workers  to  a  maximum  of  4,100  workers  at  peak  building.  During  shift  changes  at  peak 
employment,  2,200  vehicles  are  expected  to  use  local  roads.  PSEG  expects,  on  average, 

50  vehicles  per  day  to  deliver  construction  materials,  equipment,  and  supplies  to  the  site 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

PSEG  conducted  a  traffic  impact  analysis  (TIA)  to  determine  traffic  impacts  around  the  PSEG 
Site  (PSEG  2013-TN2525).  The  TIA  analyzed  deterioration  of  LOS  on  roads  and  intersections 
in  Salem  County  using  the  following  assumptions:  (1)  the  maximum  anticipated  construction 
workforce;  (2)  build-out  year  of  2021 ;  (3)  use  of  key  routes  even  though  other,  less-traveled 
routes  are  available;  and  (4)  traffic  load  based  upon  a  combination  of  peak  construction,  outage 
workforce,  maximum  operations  workforce  at  the  PSEG  Site,  and  baseline  background  traffic 
(which  incorporates  current  HCGS  and  SGS  employees)  (PSEG  2013-TN2525).  The  analysis 
in  the  TIA  is  significantly  more  conservative  than  the  analysis  presented  by  PSEG  in  its  ER 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  assumptions  are  detailed  in  Table  4-12  and  the  results  in 
Table  4-13.

342  workers. 

(d)  The  traffic  impact  analysis  assumes  all  trucks  used  for  building  would  be  traveling  to  the  site  during  peak  building. 
This  includes  trucks  used  for  fill,  concrete  shipments,  etc.,  that  would  actually  be  distributed  more  evenly 
throughout  the  building  phase.  The  average  number  of  trucks  per  day  would  be  closer  to  50  throughout  the 
building  phase. 

(e)  HCGS/SGS  personnel  are  considered  part  of  the  background  counts. 

Sources:  PSEG  2013-TN2525;  PSEG  2015-TN4280. 


The  TIA  indicated  that  five  intersections  in  Salem  County  would  have  traffic  levels  that 
deteriorated  below  New  Jersey  acceptable  standards  (LOS  B  or  better)  (PSEG  2013-TN2525). 
The  intersections  are 

•  Grieves  Parkway  and  Chestnut  Street  (unsignalized), 

•  Grieves  Parkway  and  Oak  Street  (unsignalized), 

•  Grieves  Parkway  and  Walnut  Street  (unsignalized), 

•  Front  Street  and  NJ  Route  49  (signalized),  and 

•  Market  Street  and  NJ  Route  49  (signalized). 

The  TIA  indicated  the  most  effective  mitigation  strategies  for  these  intersections  would  be  the 
following  (PSEG  2013-TN2525): 

•  changing  the  three  Grieves  Parkway  intersections  from  two-way  stop  sign  controls  to  traffic 
light  controls, 

•  constructing  turn  bays  at  the  Grieves  Parkway-Oak  Street  intersection,  and 

•  adding  another  turn  bay  at  the  Front  Street-NJ  Route  49  intersection. 

The  TIA  indicated  that,  without  mitigation  measures,  LOS  would  deteriorate.  The  suggested 
mitigation  measures  in  the  TIA  may  improve  the  LOS;  however,  some  intersections  would 
remain  below  the  New  Jersey  acceptable  standard.  There  is  no  room  to  expand  one  of  the 
intersections,  Broadway  (Route  49)  and  Market  St  (Route  45),  and  no  mitigation  measures  have 
been  suggested.  There  is  no  room  to  expand  the  Broadway  (Route  49)  and  Front  Street 
intersection  beyond  the  current  suggested  mitigation  measure.  The  proposed  causeway  would 
separate  all  traffic  to  and  from  the  new  plant  from  traffic  associated  with  the  existing  HCGS  and 
SGS  operations.  The  impacts  from  these  two  streams  of  traffic  (from  HCGS/SGS  operations 
and  PSEG  building  activities)  would  interact  when  they  converge  around  Salem  City 
(PSEG  2013-TN2525).

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


As  discussed  above,  the  TIA  is  based  on  a  combination  of  peak  construction  employment, 
outage  workforce,  operations  workforce,  and  baseline  background  traffic.  The  peak 
construction  workforce  is  assumed  to  occur  during  construction  months  42  through  51.  Without 
mitigation,  the  review  team  expects  the  traffic  impacts  from  building  would  be  noticeable  and  not 
destabilizing,  especially  for  the  key  intersections  identified  by  the  TIA.  If  the  mitigation  activities 
recommended  in  the  TIA  were  undertaken,  the  review  team  expects  the  impact  to  traffic  in  the 
region  would  be  minimal,  with  localized,  temporary,  noticeable,  and  adverse  impacts  around 
Salem. 

4. 4. 4. 2  Recreation 

Recreational  resources  in  the  economic  impact  area  may  be  affected  by  building  activities  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  Impacts  may  include  (1)  increased  user  demand  associated  with  the  projected 
increase  in  population  as  a  result  of  the  in-migrating  workforce  and  their  families,  (2)  impaired 
recreational  experience  associated  with  the  views  of  the  building  process  and  the  potential 
cooling  tower,  and  (3)  access  delays  associated  with  increased  traffic  on  local  roadways. 
Increased  user  demand  as  a  result  of  the  in-migrating  population  may  include  increased 
competition  for  recreational  vehicle  spaces  at  campgrounds,  which  could  be  used  for  temporary 
housing  for  some  of  the  workforce. 

As  discussed  in  Section  4.4.1,  there  would  be  some  aesthetic  impacts  at  recreational  areas  that 
have  an  unobstructed  view  of  the  PSEG  Site.  These  areas  are  typically  across  the  Delaware 
River  in  Delaware.  There  would  be  additional  aesthetic  impacts  from  the  PSEG  EEP  viewing 
platforms.  The  building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  add  to  the  industrial  nature  of  the  site. 
Also,  people  using  recreational  facilities  in  Salem  County  may  experience  traffic  congestion  on 
the  roads  during  the  morning  and  afternoon  commutes  of  the  building  workforce. 

However,  because  85  percent  of  the  workforce  for  building  already  lives  within  commuting 
distance  of  the  site,  the  review  team  does  not  expect  any  stresses  to  be  placed  upon  the 
capacity  of  recreational  facilities  near  the  PSEG  Site.  Also,  after  discussions  with  local  officials, 
the  review  team  does  not  expect  any  impacts  on  recreational  trapping  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site 
(NRC  2012-TN2499). 

The  economic  impact  area  and  the  region’s  parks  and  recreational  facilities  have  sufficient 
capacity  to  accommodate  in-migrating  workers  and  their  families,  and  the  review  team  expects 
no  impact  to  trapping  near  the  site.  The  review  team  expects  the  impacts  to  recreational 
activities  in  the  vicinity  to  be  minimal  except  for  a  noticeable  but  not  destabilizing  aesthetic 
impact  from  building  activities  at  the  site  that  cannot  be  reduced  through  mitigation  and  a 
localized,  temporary,  noticeable  but  not  destabilizing  impact  for  recreational  traffic. 

4. 4. 4. 3  Housing 

Section  2. 5. 2. 5  discusses  housing  information  for  the  economic  impact  area.  According  to 
Table  2-30,  there  are  30,578  vacant  housing  units  available  for  purchase  or  rent  in  all  counties 
of  the  economic  impact  area,  and  every  county  had  a  significant  supply  of  vacant  units.  As 
discussed  in  Section  4.4.2,  617  workers  and  their  families  would  move  into  the  economic  impact 
area  from  outside  the  50-mi.  region.  The  rest  of  the  peak  construction  workforce  is  expected  to 
come  from  the  region  and  commute  daily  to  the  site,  therefore  having  no  impact  on  the  housing 
stock.

In  addition  to  the  housing  stock  for  owner-occupied  housing  and  rental  units,  there  is  also 
sufficient  stock  of  temporary  housing  in  the  economic  impact  area,  if  workers  decide  to  stay  in 
hotels,  motels,  or  campgrounds.  Construction  workers  are  more  likely  to  take  advantage  of  the 
temporary  housing  stock  because  they  are  expected  to  be  at  the  PSEG  Site  for  a  relatively  short 
time  period.  Salem  County  officials  also  indicate  that  many  outage  workers  who  come  from 
outside  the  region  rent  out  rooms  in  single-family  homes  in  localities  near  the  site  (NRC  2012- 
TN2499). 

Given  the  large  supply  of  vacant  housing  relative  to  the  in-migrating  workforce  during  peak 
building  employment  and  the  availability  of  short-term  accommodations,  the  review  team 
expects  sufficient  housing  to  be  available  for  workers  relocating  to  the  area  and  that  there  would 
be  minimal  impacts  on  the  housing  supply  or  prices  in  the  local  area.  In  addition,  given  the 
large  supply  of  vacant  housing,  the  short-term  accommodations,  and  the  temporary  nature  of 
the  construction  workforce  in  the  area,  the  review  team  does  not  expect  the  in-migrating 
workers  and  families  would  stimulate  new  housing. 

Building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  could  affect  housing  values  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site.  In  a 
review  of  previous  studies  on  the  effect  of  seven  nuclear  power  facilities,  including  four  nuclear 
power  plants,  on  property  values  in  surrounding  communities,  Bezdek  and  Wendling 
(Bezdek  and  Wendling  2006-TN2748)  concluded  that  assessed  valuations  and  median  housing 
prices  have  tended  to  increase  at  rates  above  national  and  State  averages.  Clark  et  al. 

(Clark  et  al.  1 997-TN3000)  similarly  found  that  housing  prices  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  two 
nuclear  power  plants  in  California  were  not  affected  by  any  negative  views  of  the  facilities. 

These  findings  differ  from  studies  that  looked  at  undesirable  facilities,  largely  related  to 
hazardous  waste  sites  and  landfills,  but  also  including  several  studies  on  power  facilities 
(Farber  1998-TN2857)  in  which  property  values  were  negatively  affected  in  the  short-term,  but 
these  effects  were  moderated  over  time.  Bezdek  and  Wendling  attributed  the  increase  in 
housing  prices  to  benefits  provided  to  the  community  in  terms  of  employment  and  tax  revenues, 
with  surplus  tax  revenues  encouraging  other  private  development  in  the  area.  Given  the 
findings  from  the  studies  discussed  above,  the  review  team  expects  that  the  impact  on  housing 
values  from  building  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minor.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG,  interviews  with  local  officials,  and  its  own 
independent  review,  the  review  team  expects  there  would  be  minimal  impacts  in  the  economic 
impact  area  and  the  region  on  the  price  and  availability  of  housing  from  building  at  the  PSEG 
Site. 

4. 4. 4. 4  Public  Services 

This  section  discusses  the  impacts  on  existing  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  police,  fire, 
and  health  care  services  in  the  economic  impact  area. 

Water  Supply  and  Wastewater  Treatment  Services 

About  85  percent  of  the  project  workforce  would  be  local  workers  who  currently  reside  in  the 
region.  The  majority  of  these  workers  would  commute  from  their  homes  to  the  project  site  and 
would  not  relocate.  Therefore,  the  majority  of  workers  are  currently  served  by  the  water  supply 
and  wastewater  treatment  facilities  within  the  communities  in  which  they  reside. 

At  peak  employment,  the  review  team  expects  617  workers  and  their  families  to  move  into  the 
economic  impact  area.  This  would  constitute  a  total  of  1,654  people  moving  into  the  economic 
impact  area  at  peak  construction.  These  relocating  workers  would  increase  the  demand  on  the 
water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment  services  within  the  communities  where  they  would 
reside. 

The  review  team  calculated  the  increase  in  demand  for  residential  water  based  on  the  increase 
in  people,  using  the  New  Jersey  per  capita  demand  for  water  of  100  gpd  (Barnett  2010- 
TN2484).  Table  4-15  shows  the  impact  of  the  increased  population  on  the  excess  capacity 
within  each  county  of  the  economic  impact  area.  As  shown  in  Table  4-15,  Salem  County  would 
have  a  2.44  percent  increase  in  water  demand  and  the  rest  of  the  counties  in  the  economic 
impact  area  would  have  less  than  a  four-tenths  of  1  percent  increase. 

Given  the  small  increase  in  demand  that  would  result  from  the  in-migrating  workers  and  their 
families  compared  to  existing  supply,  the  review  team  determined  that  impacts  on  water  supply 
in  the  economic  impact  area  would  be  minimal,  and  mitigation  would  not  be  warranted.

capacity  within  each  county  of  the  economic  impact  area.  As  shown  in  Table  4-16,  Salem 
County  would  have  a  3.0  percent  increase  in  wastewater  demand,  and  the  rest  of  the  counties 
in  the  economic  impact  area  would  have  less  than  a  four-tenths  of  1  percent  increase.

Given  the  small  increase  in  demand  for  wastewater  treatment  that  would  result  from  the 
in-migrating  workers  and  their  families  compared  to  the  existing  supply,  the  review  team 
determined  that  impacts  on  wastewater  treatment  in  the  economic  impact  area  would  be 
minimal,  and  mitigation  would  not  be  warranted. 

PSEG  indicates  that  a  freshwater  aquifer  that  currently  supplies  HCGS  and  SGS  would  also 
supply  the  construction  site  with  potable  and  sanitary  water,  fire  protection  water,  and  water  for 
other  miscellaneous  construction  uses  such  as  concrete  batch  plant  supply  and  dust 
suppression.  PSEG  indicates  that  it  would  need  about  171 ,360  gpd  onsite  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  The  review  team  expects  the  impact  of  aquifer  use  on  groundwater  supply  in  the 
economic  impact  area  would  be  negligible  and  would  be  subject  to  permit  requirements. 

Further  analysis  of  groundwater  withdrawal  during  construction  is  in  Section  4.2  of  this  EIS. 
PSEG  also  has  a  wastewater  treatment  facility  on  the  site  for  the  HCGS  and  SGS,  but  it  was 
only  sized  for  the  demand  at  HCGS  and  SGS.  PSEG  would  install  a  new  sewage  treatment 
facility  or  expand  the  existing  one  to  meet  needs  for  the  PSEG  building  and  operations 
workforce.  There  would  be  no  offsite  treatment  of  wastewater  from  the  new  plant  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  Therefore,  there  would  be  no  impact  on  wastewater  facilities  from  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  review  team  concluded  from  the  information  provided  by  PSEG,  interviews  with  local 
planners  and  officials,  and  its  own  independent  evaluation  that  building  at  the  PSEG  Site  would 
have  minimal  impacts  on  the  local  water  supply  and  on  wastewater  treatment  facilities  and  no 
mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

Police,  Fire,  and  Health  Care  Services 

The  building  workforce  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  increase  the  demand  on  police,  fire,  and  health 
care  services  within  the  communities  where  workers  reside  and  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

About  85  percent  of  the  project  workforce  would  be  local  workers  who  currently  reside  in  the 
region.  The  majority  of  these  workers  would  commute  from  their  homes  to  the  project  site  and 
would  not  relocate.  Therefore,  the  existing  police,  fire,  and  health  care  services  in  the  50-mi 


NUREG-2168 


4-76 


November  2015 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


region  already  serve  the  majority  of  the  proposed  project's  construction  workers  within  the 
communities  in  which  they  reside. 

At  peak  employment,  the  review  team  expects  617  workers  and  their  families  to  move  into 
the  economic  impact  area  for  a  total  of  1 .654  people  (workers  plus  their  families).  These 
in-migrating  workers  and  their  families  would  increase  the  demand  on  the  police,  fire,  and  health 
care  services  within  the  communities  where  they  would  reside. 

No  county  in  the  economic  impact  area,  except  Salem  County,  has  a  projected  population 
increase  at  peak  employment  of  more  than  1  percent.  Salem  County’s  projected  increase  is 
1 .22  percent.  In  discussion  with  local  officials  of  the  localities  closest  to  the  site  (Lower 
Alloways  Creek  Township.  Elsinboro  Township,  and  Salem  County),  the  review  team  found  that 
such  minimal  increases  in  population  should  not  have  any  noticeable  effect  on  the  performance 
of  police,  fire,  and  health  care  services  at  peak  employment  in  the  economic  impact  area 
(NRC  2012-TN2499). 

Locally,  Elsinboro  Township  receives  police  services  from  a  contract  with  Lower  Alloways  Creek 
Township  and  its  fire  protection  and  emergency  medical  services  are  provided  by  volunteer 
forces.  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township  has  its  own  police  force  and  volunteer  fire  and 
emergency  medical  services  forces.  Salem  City  has  its  own  police  force  and  fire/emergency 
medical  services  as  well.  Salem  County  also  has  a  sheriffs  office  and  is  patrolled  by  State 
police.  All  hospitals  in  the  area  are  under  capacity  (NRC  2012-TN2499).  Because  of  their 
proximity  to  the  site,  these  three  jurisdictions  in  Salem  County  would  receive  the  greatest 
impacts  from  construction  worker  injuries  or  accidents  on  the  roads  leading  to  the  site  and  at  the 
site.  These  personnel  may  encounter  traffic  congestion  on  local  roadways  when  responding  to 
calls  when  the  building  workforce  is  commuting  to  the  site,  especially  during  peak  employment 
periods.  However,  the  area  around  the  PSEG  Site  is  sparsely  populated,  so  there  would  not  be 
a  high  demand  for  these  personnel  near  the  site.  In  addition,  measures  to  mitigate  traffic  delays 
have  been  recommended  and  are  discussed  in  Section  4.4.4. 1  of  this  EIS;  these  could  reduce 
the  impacts  on  emergency  responders  as  well  as  on  members  of  the  general  public  using  local 
roadways. 

Based  on  discussions  with  local  officials  and  its  own  independent  analysis,  the  review  team 
expects  a  minimal  impact  on  police,  fire,  and  health  care  services  from  building  activities  at  the 
PSEG  Site,  and  no  mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

4. 4. 4. 5  Education 

The  building  workforce  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  increase  the  demand  for  educational  services 
within  the  communities  where  workers  reside.  About  85  percent  of  the  project  workforce  would 
be  local  workers  who  currently  reside  in  the  region.  The  majority  of  these  workers  would 
commute  from  their  homes  to  the  project  site  and  would  not  relocate.  Therefore,  the  majority  of 
workers  are  currently  served  by  the  educational  services  within  the  communities  where  they 
reside. 

As  shown  in  Table  4-17,  during  peak  building  there  would  be  an  estimated  increase  of 
283  students  in  the  economic  impact  area.  The  review  team  determined  this  to  be  a  small 


November  2015 


4-77 


NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


increase  compared  to  the  existing  rolls  in  the  economic  impact  area  (more  than 
160,000  students,  as  shown  in  Table  2-34).  No  county  in  the  economic  impact  area  would 
experience  a  noticeable  increase  in  the  number  of  students  per  teacher.  The  greatest  increase 
in  student-to-teacher  ratios  would  be  in  Salem  County,  where  the  increase  would  be  slightly 
greater  than  one-tenth  of  a  student  per  teacher.  Some  schools  may  receive  higher  numbers  of 
children  during  peak  employment  because  of  amenities  and  the  school  choice  programs 
available  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware.

Because  of  these  estimates,  the  public  choice  programs,  and  discussions  with  local  officials,  the 
review  team  foresees  minimal  impacts  on  local  school  districts  and  schools  in  the  economic 
impact  area,  and  no  mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

4. 4. 4. 6  Summary  of  Community  Service  and  Infrastructure  Impacts 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  evaluation  and 
outreach,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  building-related  impacts  to  all  infrastructure  and 
community  services  would  be  SMALL  for  the  region  and  the  economic  impact  area,  with  the 
exception  of  recreation-related  traffic  and  aesthetics  near  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review  team 
expects  MODERATE,  temporary  adverse  impacts  on  traffic  on  local  recreation  routes  near  the 
PSEG  Site.  These  impacts  could  be  reduced  by  further  planning  and  mitigation  measures 
similar  to  those  discussed  in  the  TIA.  The  review  team  expects  MODERATE  adverse  impacts 
to  local  recreational  resources  due  to  impacts  on  “viewsheds”  and  noticeable  traffic  impacts. 

For  aesthetic  impacts  to  recreational  activities,  the  review  team  determined  that  additional 
mitigation  beyond  what  has  already  been  proposed  by  PSEG  would  not  reduce  the  expected 
impact  below  MODERATE. 

Based  on  the  above  information,  the  review  team  determined  the  impacts  of  NRC-authorized 
construction  activities  on  infrastructure  and  community  services  for  MODERATE  impact 
categories  (traffic  and  recreation-related  aesthetics)  are  integrally  related  to  the  period  of 
maximum  construction  workforce  and  therefore  would  also  be  MODERATE.

4.4.5  Summary  of  Socioeconomic  Impacts 

The  review  team  has  assessed  the  activities  related  to  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  and  the  potential  socioeconomic  impacts  in  the  region  and  economic  impact  area. 
The  above  discussion  includes  scenarios  with  and  without  mitigation.  However,  given  that  the 
applicant  identified  specific  mitigation  actions  for  each  category,  which  are  consistent  with 
industry  standards  or  required  by  local  ordinances  and  which  would  reduce  negative  impacts, 
the  review  team  finds  it  reasonable  to  assume  for  this  summary  that  those  mitigating  actions 
would  be  successfully  implemented.  Therefore,  for  clarity,  the  summary  discussion  below  refers 
strictly  to  the  expected  level  of  impacts  following  the  implementation  of  applicant-identified 
mitigation. 

Physical  impacts  on  workers  and  the  general  public  would  include  those  related  to  noise  levels, 
air  quality,  existing  buildings,  transportation  resources,  and  aesthetics.  The  review  team 
concludes  most  physical  impacts  from  building  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL,  with  the 
exception  of  MODERATE  impacts  to  local  roadways  and  aesthetics.  Physical  impacts  to  local 
roadways  would  be  manageable  with  mitigation  required  by  local  ordinances.  Aesthetic  impacts 
could  not  be  mitigated. 

On  the  basis  of  information  supplied  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team  interviews  conducted  with 
public  officials,  the  review  team  concludes  that  impacts  on  the  demographics  of  the  region  and 
economic  impact  area  from  building  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL.  Economic  impacts 
throughout  the  region  and  economic  impact  area  would  be  SMALL  and  beneficial,  with  the 
exception  of  MODERATE  and  beneficial  economic  impacts  to  Salem  County.  Tax  impacts 
would  be  SMALL  and  beneficial  throughout  the  region  and  economic  impact  area. 

Infrastructure  and  community  services  impacts  span  issues  associated  with  traffic,  recreation, 
housing,  public  services,  and  education.  Impacts  from  building  at  the  PSEG  Site  on  housing, 
public  services,  and  education  would  be  SMALL.  Traffic  impacts  are  expected  to  be  localized, 
short-term,  MODERATE,  and  adverse.  These  impacts  could  be  reduced  by  further  planning 
and  mitigation  measures  similar  to  those  discussed  in  the  TIA.  Recreational  impacts  would  be 
MODERATE  and  adverse  due  to  impacts  to  roadways  around  recreational  resources  and  on 
viewsheds  from  the  increased  industrial  character  of  the  PSEG  Site. 

4.5  Environmental  Justice  Impacts 

The  review  team  evaluated  whether  minority  or  low-income  populations  would  experience 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  human  health  or  environmental  effects  from  building  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  To  perform  this  assessment,  the  review  team 
(1)  identified  (through  U.S.  Census  Bureau  and  American  Community  Survey  demographic 
data,  the  PSEG  ER  [PSEG  201 5-TN4280],  and  site  visit  assessments)  minority  and  low-income 
populations  of  interest;  (2)  identified  all  potentially  significant  pathways  for  human  health, 
environmental,  physical,  and  socioeconomic  effects  on  those  identified  populations  of  interest; 
and  (3)  determined  whether  the  characteristics  of  the  pathway  or  special  circumstances  of  the 
minority  or  low-income  populations  would  result  in  a  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impact.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


To  perform  this  assessment,  the  review  team  followed  the  method  described  in  Section  2.6.1. 

In  the  context  of  building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site,  the  review  team  considered  the  questions 
outlined  in  Section  2.6.1 .  For  all  three  health-related  questions,  the  review  team  determined 
that  the  level  of  environmental  emissions  projected  is  well  below  the  protection  levels 
established  by  the  NRC  and  EPA  regulations  and  would  not  impose  a  disproportionate  and 
adverse  effect  on  minority  or  low-income  populations. 

4.5.1  Health  Impacts 

Section  4.8  assesses  the  nonradiological  health  effects  for  construction  workers  and  the  local 
population  from  fugitive  dust,  noise,  occupational  injuries,  and  transport  of  materials  and 
personnel.  In  Section  4.8,  the  review  team  concludes  that  nonradiological  health  impacts  would 
be  SMALL.  The  review  team’s  investigation  and  outreach  did  not  identify  any  unique 
characteristics  or  practices  among  minority  or  low-income  populations  that  might  result  in 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  nonradiological  health  effects. 

Section  4.9  assesses  the  radiological  doses  to  construction  workers  and  the  local  population 
and  concludes  that  the  doses  would  be  within  the  NRC  and  EPA  dose  standards.  Section  4.9 
concludes  that  radiological  health  impacts  on  the  construction  workforce  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  be  SMALL.  In  addition,  there  would  be  no  radioactive  material  on  the  construction  site 
except  for  very  small  sources  such  as  those  commonly  used  by  radiographers;  therefore,  there 
would  be  no  radiation  exposure  to  members  of  the  public  from  building  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Based  on  this  information,  the  review  team  concludes  that  there  would  be  no  disproportionately 
high  and  adverse  impact  on  low-income  or  minority  populations. 

4.5.2  Physical  and  Environmental  Impacts 

For  the  physical  and  environmental  considerations  described  in  Section  2.6.1 ,  the  review  team 
determined  through  literature  searches  and  consultations  that  (1)  the  impacts  on  the  natural  or 
physical  environment  would  not  significantly  or  adversely  affect  a  particular  group,  (2)  no 
minority  or  low-income  population  would  experience  an  adverse  impact  that  would  appreciably 
exceed  or  be  likely  to  appreciably  exceed  those  of  the  general  population,  and  (3)  the 
environmental  effects  would  not  occur  in  groups  affected  by  cumulative  or  multiple  adverse 
exposure  from  environmental  hazards. 

The  review  team  determined  that  the  physical  and  environmental  impacts  from  onsite  building 
activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  attenuate  rapidly  with  distance,  intervening  foliage,  and 
terrain.  There  are  four  primary  exposure  media  in  the  environment:  soil,  water,  air,  and  noise. 
The  following  sections  discuss  each  of  these  pathways  in  greater  detail. 

4.5.2. 7  Soil 

Building  activities  on  the  PSEG  Site  represent  the  largest  source  of  soil-related  environmental 
impacts.  The  site  is  well-defined,  and  access  is  restricted.  Soil-disturbing  activities  are 
localized  on  the  site,  sufficiently  distant  from  surrounding  populations,  and  have  little  ability  to 
migrate,  resulting  in  no  noticeable  offsite  impacts.  Soil  migration  would  be  minimized  by 
adherence  to  regulations,  permits,  and  the  use  of  BMPs.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


4. 5. 2. 2  Water 

Water-related  environmental  impacts  from  erosion-related  degradation  of  surface  water  and  the 
introduction  of  anthropogenic  substances  into  surface  and  groundwater  would  occur,  but  the 
impacts  would  be  mitigated  through  adherence  to  permit  requirements  and  BMPs.  Increased 
water  turbidity  during  dredging  activities  could  affect  nearshore  water  quality,  but  the  effect 
would  be  minimized  through  adherence  to  permit  requirements  and  BMPs.  Consumptive  use  of 
surface  water  for  building  activities  would  also  occur  but  would  have  only  a  minimal  effect 
because  the  water  supply  is  from  the  Delaware  River.  The  water-related  impacts  of  building 
activities  associated  with  the  proposed  action  would  be  of  limited  magnitude,  localized,  and 
temporary. 

4. 5.2.3  Air 

Air  emissions  are  expected  from  increased  vehicle  traffic,  construction  equipment,  and  fugitive 
dust  from  building  activities.  Emissions  from  vehicles  and  construction  equipment  would  be 
unavoidable  but  would  be  temporary  and  minor  in  nature  and  subject  to  management  under 
State  and  Federal  air  regulations  and  permits.  Furthermore,  because  of  the  distance  between 
the  site  and  the  closest  minority  or  low-income  population,  the  review  team  did  not  identify  any 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  from  air-related  pathways. 

4. 5. 2. 4  Noise 

Noise  would  result  from  clearing;  moving  earth;  preparing  foundations;  pile-driving;  concrete 
mixing  and  pouring;  erecting  steel  structures;  and  various  stages  of  facility  equipment 
fabrication,  assembly,  and  installation.  PSEG  would,  however,  use  standard  noise  control 
measures  for  construction  equipment,  limit  the  types  of  building  activities  during  nighttime  and 
weekend  hours,  notify  all  potentially  affected  neighbors  of  planned  activities,  and  establish  a 
construction-noise  monitoring  program.  The  review  team  determined  that  noise  impacts  on  the 
public  would  be  temporary  and  would  not  be  significant;  therefore,  the  review  team  determined 
there  would  be  no  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impact  on  any  minority  or  low-income 
population  from  noise. 

4. 5. 2. 5  Summary  of  Physical  and  Environmental  Impacts 

The  review  team’s  investigation  and  outreach  did  not  identify  any  unique  characteristics  or 
practices  among  minority  or  low-income  populations  that  might  result  in  physical  or 
environmental  impacts  on  them  that  were  different  from  those  on  the  general  population. 

As  discussed  in  Section  2.6,  most  of  the  census  block  groups  classified  as  minority  or  low- 
income  are  located  across  the  Delaware  River  in  New  Castle  County.  The  closest  block  groups 
to  the  site  are  about  8  mi  north  of  the  PSEG  Site  in  the  City  of  Salem.  The  census  block  groups 
would  not  be  affected  by  any  physical  or  environmental  impacts  because  of  the  distance  from 
the  site. 

On  the  basis  of  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review,  the 
review  team  found  no  pathways  from  soil,  water,  air,  and  noise  that  would  lead  to 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  on  minority  or  low-income  populations.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


4.5.3  Socioeconomic  Impacts 

Socioeconomic  impacts  (discussed  in  Section  4.4)  were  reviewed  to  evaluate  whether  there 
would  be  any  building  activities  that  could  have  a  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impact  on 
minority  or  low-income  populations.  Except  for  effects  on  traffic  and  recreational  resources,  all 
adverse  socioeconomic  impacts  associated  with  building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  are 
expected  to  be  SMALL  for  the  general  public.  The  review  team  found  that  there  could  be 
adverse  MODERATE  impacts  on  traffic  and  recreational  resources  in  Salem  County;  however, 
these  impacts  are  not  expected  to  disproportionately  affect  the  nearby  low-income  and  minority 
populations. 

4.5.4  Subsistence  and  Special  Conditions 

The  NRC  method  for  environmental  justice  assessments  includes  assessment  of  populations 
with  unique  characteristics  such  as  minority  communities  exceptionally  dependent  on 
subsistence  resources  or  identifiable  in  compact  locations,  such  as  Native  American  settlements 
or  high-density  concentrations  of  minority  populations. 

4.5.4. 7  Subsistence 

Access  to  the  PSEG  Site  is  restricted;  such  restricted  access  reduces  any  impact  on  plant¬ 
gathering,  hunting,  and  fishing  activities  at  the  site.  PSEG  and  the  review  team  independently 
interviewed  community  leaders  in  Salem  County  and  New  Castle  County  and  found  that  no 
such  practices  were  identified  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  nor  any  documented  subsistence 
fishing  in  the  Delaware  River.  As  discussed,  in  Section  2.6.3,  hunting,  plant-gathering,  and 
fishing  are  all  done  for  recreational  purposes. 

From  the  information  provided  by  PSEG,  interviews  with  local  officials,  and  the  review  team’s 
independent  evaluation,  the  review  team  concludes  that  there  would  be  no  building-related 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  on  subsistence  activities  on  minority  or  low-income 
populations. 

4. 5. 4. 2  High-Density  Communities 

As  discussed  in  Section  2.6.3,  there  are  no  high-density  communities  in  Elsinboro  and  Lower 
Alloways  Creek  Townships.  There  are  two  public  housing  projects  in  Penns  Grove  and  three  in 
Salem  City.  From  its  own  independent  evaluation  and  interaction  with  local  officials,  the  review 
team  does  not  predict  any  impacts  to  the  communities  in  Penns  Grove  from  building  activities  at 
the  PSEG  Site.  However,  the  three  Salem  City  communities  would  notice  an  adverse  effect 
from  construction  traffic  similar  to  the  rest  of  the  area  around  Salem  City.  The  review  team, 
after  discussions  with  local  officials  from  Salem,  does  not  believe  the  impact  would 
disproportionately  affect  those  communities  because  no  pathways  exist.  The  impacts  would  be 
temporary  in  nature  and  PSEG  has  provided  suggested  mitigation  strategies  to  limit  any 
impacts.

4.5.5  Migrant  Labor 

As  discussed  in  Section  2.6.4,  the  main  migrant  populations  closest  to  the  site  are  the  HCGS 
and  SGS  outage  workforces.  There  are  farm  workers  in  the  economic  impact  area  as  well,  but 
they  are  located  closer  to  or  in  Gloucester  and  Cumberland  Counties  and  not  near  the  PSEG 
Site.  Therefore,  from  the  information  provided  by  PSEG,  interviews  with  local  officials,  and  the 
review  team's  independent  evaluation,  the  review  team  concludes  that  there  would  be  no 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  on  minority  or  low-income  migrant  laborers. 

4.5.6  Summary  of  Environmental  Justice  Impacts 

The  review  team  evaluated  the  impacts  of  building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  on  environmental 
justice  populations.  The  review  team  did  not  identify  any  potential  environmental  pathways  by 
which  the  identified  minority  or  low-income  populations  in  the  50-mi  region  and  economic  impact 
area  would  likely  experience  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  human  health,  environmental, 
physical,  or  socioeconomic  effects  as  a  result  of  building  activities. 

Based  on  the  preceding  analysis,  and  because  the  NRC-authorized  construction  activities 
represent  only  a  part  of  the  analyzed  activities,  the  review  team  concludes  that  there  would  be 
no  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  on  minority  and  low-income  populations 
resulting  from  building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

4.6  Historic  and  Cultural  Resources 

NEPA  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661 )  requires  Federal  agencies  to  take  into  account  the 
potential  effects  of  their  undertakings  on  the  cultural  environment,  which  includes  archaeological 
sites,  historic  buildings,  and  traditional  places  important  to  a  community.  The  National  Historic 
Preservation  Act  of  1966,  as  amended  (NHPA,  54  USC  300101  et  seq.  -TN4157),  also  requires 
Federal  agencies  to  consider  impacts  to  those  resources  if  they  are  eligible  for  listing  on  the 
National  Register  of  Historic  Places  (NRHP).  Such  resources  are  referred  to  as  “historic 
properties”  in  NHPA.  As  outlined  in  36  CFR  800.8  (TN513),  “Coordination  with  the  National 
Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969”,  the  NRC  is  coordinating  compliance  with  Section  106  of 
NHPA  in  fulfilling  its  responsibilities  under  NEPA. 

Building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  could  affect  either  known  or  undiscovered  historic  and 
cultural  resources.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  NHPA  and  NEPA,  the  NRC  and  the 
USACE,  cooperating  Federal  agencies,  are  required  to  make  a  reasonable  and  good  faith  effort 
to  identify  historic  properties  and  cultural  resources  in  the  areas  of  potential  effect  (APEs)  and 
permit  areas  and,  if  present,  determine  whether  any  significant  impacts  are  likely.  Identification 
is  to  occur  in  consultation  with  the  appropriate  state  historic  preservation  officer,  Native 
American  tribes,  interested  parties,  and  the  public.  If  significant  impacts  are  possible,  efforts 
should  be  made  to  mitigate  them. 

Because  the  NRC  and  the  USACE  each  have  separate  regulatory  authority,  no  one  agency  is 
responsible  for  all  aspects  of  the  project.  The  NRC  is  responsible  for  effects  resulting  from  the 
construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Other  aspects  of  the  project,  such  as 
development  of  the  causeway  and  dredging  for  a  barge  facility,  are  the  responsibility  of  the

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


USACE.  Cultural  resources  that  could  be  affected  by  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  could 
include  archaeological  sites,  historic  resources  in  the  vicinity  of  the  plant,  and  traditional  cultural 
properties  of  significance  to  Native  Americans. 

The  NRC  is  responsible  for  considering  potential  effects  on  historic  and  cultural  resources  on 
Artificial  Island  and  any  potential  visual  impacts  resulting  from  the  construction  and  operation  of 
a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Artificial  Island  is  a  human-made  island  and  therefore  has  no 
potential  for  intact  archaeological  remains;  however,  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
could  visually  impact  historic  properties.  For  a  description  of  the  efforts  undertaken  to  identify 
historic  and  cultural  resources  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site,  see  Section  2.7.  Six  historic 
properties  listed  in  the  NRHP  in  New  Jersey  and  18  historic  properties  in  Delaware  are  visible  in 
the  4.9-mi  APE  from  the  project  area.  Two  additional  properties  with  the  potential  for  listing 
were  noted  in  New  Jersey,  and  one  property  with  the  potential  for  listing  was  found  in  Delaware 
(AKRF  2012-TN2876).  Analyses  conducted  on  behalf  of  PSEG  examined  the  visual  effect  of 
the  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  (MACTEC  2009-TN2543;  AKRF  2012-TN2876). 
Based  on  a  revised  New  Jersey  State  Historic  Preservation  Office  (SHPO)  opinion  received  on 
December  4,  2014  (NJDEP  2014-TN4288),  additional  research  was  undertaken  in  2015  (see 
Section  2.7.4  for  a  description  of  the  2015  efforts).  Consultation  conducted  from  January  to 
June  2015  found  that  two  new  natural  draft  cooling  towers  would  be  visible  from  the  Abel  and 
Mary  Nicholson  House  (127  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road,  Elsinboro  Township),  the 
property  at  349  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road,  and  the  property  at  116  Mason  Point  Road 
(AKRF  201 5-TN4287).  In  the  draft  EIS,  because  the  location  of  the  PSEG  Site  is  adjacent  to 
the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  units,  the  introduction  of  two  proposed  NDCTs  would  be  consistent 
with  the  existing  landscape.  Therefore,  the  NRC  determined  that  the  visual  impacts  from  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  would  not  have  an  adverse  effect  on  historic  properties.  The  Delaware 
SHPO  concurred  that  no  adverse  effects  to  historic  resources  under  its  jurisdiction  would  result 
from  the  project  (DDHCA  2013-TN2639)  (see  Appendix  C).  The  New  Jersey  SHPO  concurred 
that  no  adverse  effects  would  result  from  the  ESP  in  2013  (NJDEP  2013-TN2870). 

However  in  December  2014,  the  New  Jersey  SHPO  issued  a  new  opinion  of  adverse  effect  to 
the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House  National  Historic  Landmark  (NHL)  (NJDEP  2014-TN4288). 
After  additional  investigation,  the  NRC  determined  in  June  2015  that  the  introduction  of  two 
proposed  NDCTs  would  result  in  an  indirect  visual  adverse  effect  to  the  Abel  and  Mary 
Nicholson  House  NHL  (127  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road,  Elsinboro  Township),  and  the 
historic  properties  at  349  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road,  and  at  1 16  Mason  Point  Road 
(NRC  2015-TN4290).  The  effect  from  the  visual  intrusion  of  two  proposed  NDCTs  on  historic 
properties  would  be  variable  and  influenced  by  climatic  conditions.  The  effect  determination  for 
Delaware  remains  unchanged  (no  historic  properties  affected). 

The  USACE  is  responsible  for  considering  the  effects  on  historic  and  cultural  resources  of 
dredging  for  a  barge  facility,  water  intakes  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  and  construction  of  a 
causeway  and  the  Money  Island  access  road.  A  Phase  I  assessment  of  submerged  resources 
off  of  Artificial  Island  identified  three  possible  resources  (PCI  2009-TN2544).  A  Phase  II  survey 
was  performed  to  clarify  the  nature  of  the  submerged  resources,  and  they  were  determined  by 
the  contractors  conducting  the  survey  to  be  ineligible  for  NRHP  listing  (PCI  2013-TN2749).  The 
New  Jersey  SHPO  concurred  with  the  findings  of  the  Phase  II  study  that  no  historic  properties 


NUREG-2168 


4-84

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


would  be  affected  by  the  required  dredging  (NJDEP  2013-TN2742).  The  USACE  has  yet  to 
make  its  eligibility  and  effects  determinations  concerning  the  submerged  resources. 

An  archaeological  survey  completed  for  the  proposed  causeway  from  the  PSEG  Site  to  Money 
Island  Road  identified  six  archaeological  sites  (28SA179,  28SA180,  28SA181,  28SA182, 
28SA183,  and  28SA186).  All  six  sites  were  recommended  as  potentially  eligible  for  NRHP 
listing  by  the  contractors  performing  the  survey  (PSEG  2009-TN2550).  The  New  Jersey  SHPO 
indicated  that  additional  information  on  these  resources  was  necessary  and  recommended  that 
a  Phase  II  survey  was  needed.  PSEG  conducted  the  Phase  II  survey,  and  its  contractor 
recommended  that  the  sites  were  not  eligible  for  NRHP  listing.  It  was  the  contractor’s  opinion 
that  the  sites  do  not  possess  sufficient  integrity  or  significance  to  be  considered  individually 
eligible  for  NRHP  or  State  listing  or  to  be  considered  eligible  as  contributing  resources  to  either 
the  Elsinboro-Lower  Alloways  Creek  Rural  Agricultural  District  or  the  John  Mason  House 
(AKRF  2013-TN2653).  The  New  Jersey  SHPO  did  not  concur  with  the  assessment  and  has 
requested  that  additional  research  be  conducted  (NJDEP  201 3-TN2742).  The  USACE  has  yet 
to  make  its  eligibility  and  effects  determinations  concerning  the  six  sites  within  the  permit  area 
for  the  proposed  causeway. 

Several  Native  American  tribes  were  contacted  to  determine  whether  any  resources  of  concern 
to  them  were  in  the  project  area.  No  Native  American  tribes  have  responded  to  the  NRC,  so 
there  is  currently  no  indication  that  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  or  causeway 
would  result  in  adverse  effects  to  resources  of  concern  to  the  tribes.  Consultation  with  the  tribes 
will  continue  throughout  the  NEPA  process  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661 ).  No  traditional 
cultural  properties  have  been  identified  in  the  project  area.  For  a  description  of  the  consultation 
efforts  under  Section  106  for  the  project,  see  Section  2.7.3.  The  USACE  consultation  effort  is 
ongoing. 

As  discussed  above,  impacts  to  historic  and  cultural  resources  due  to  building  activities  are 
expected  to  occur  in  New  Jersey  where  three  historic  properties  would  be  visually  affected 
including  a  NHL.  No  adverse  effects  are  expected  to  archaeological  resources  from  NRC- 
authorized  construction  because  Artificial  is  a  man-made  island.  Additionally,  the  applicant  has 
a  procedure  for  inadvertent  discovery  of  archaeological  sites  during  construction  (PSEG  2012- 
TN2557).  For  the  purposes  of  the  review  team’s  NEPA  analysis,  based  on  (1 )  no  known 
significant  resources  on  Artificial  Island,  (2)  the  review  team’s  cultural  resource  analysis,  (3) 
PSEG's  procedure  for  inadvertent  discovery  of  archaeological  resources,  and  (4)  consultation 
with  the  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  SHPOs,  the  review  team  concludes  that  a  potential  indirect 
visual  adverse  effect  could  occur  in  New  Jersey.  Because  the  impact  is  indirect  and  can  be 
mitigated,  but  may  be  noticeable  depending  on  the  type  of  cooling  towers  selected,  the  overall 
NEPA  impacts  on  historic  and  cultural  resources  are  expected  to  be  SMALL  to  MODERATE. 
Even  though  the  proposed  project  is  over  4  mi  from  the  NHL  and  other  historic  properties,  and 
the  visibility  of  the  NDCTs  is  dependent  on  climatic  conditions  that  could  obscure  them  (see 
Figure  2-30  and  2-31  in  Section  2-7),  the  visual  impact  would  remain  noticeable.  If  mechanical 
draft  cooling  towers  were  selected  as  the  cooling  system,  there  would  be  no  impact  to  historic 
properties.  Potential  mitigation  strategies  were  discussed  during  consultation  and  could  include 
compensatory  or  off-setting  measures  (NRC  201 5-TN4368);  however,  the  parties  agreed  to 
defer  development  of  specific  mitigation  to  the  COL  application  stage.  A  draft  Memorandum  of 
Agreement  (MOA)  was  developed  for  the  ESP  by  the  agencies  and  consulting  parties,  which 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


identifies  the  process  for  developing  the  specific  mitigation  measures  at  the  COL  stage.  On 
September  4,  2015,  the  draft  MOA  was  issued  for  public  comment  in  the  Federal  Register  (80 
FR  53579-TN4344).  Section  106  consultation  for  the  NRC’s  portion  of  the  proposed  project  was 
completed  by  the  execution  of  the  MOA  on  October  14,  2015  (NRC  2015-TN4377).  A  copy  of 
the  final  MOA  is  provided  within  Appendix  F.  Consultations  between  the  USACE  and  the  New 
Jersey  SHPO  on  the  USACE  permit  area  for  the  ESP  are  ongoing.  This  consultation  process 
would  be  concluded  prior  to  the  issuance  of  any  Department  of  the  Army  permit.  The  New 
Jersey  SHPO  has  concurred  with  the  findings  from  PSEG’s  contractor  concerning  no  effects  on 
submerged  resources;  however,  the  USACE  has  yet  to  issue  its  finding. 

4.7  Meteorological  and  Air-Quality  Impacts 

Section  2.9  discusses  the  meteorological  characteristics  and  air  quality  at  and  around  the  PSEG 
Site.  The  primary  impacts  on  local  meteorology  and  air  quality  of  constructing  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  from  dust  generated  by  land-clearing  and  building 
activities,  emissions  from  equipment  and  machinery,  concrete  batch  plant  operations,  and 
emissions  from  vehicles  used  to  transport  workers  and  deliver  materials  to  and  from  the  site. 
Air-quality  impacts  directly  associated  with  these  activities  are  described  in  Section  4.7.1;  air- 
quality  impacts  associated  with  transportation  of  construction  workers  are  addressed  in 
Section  4.7.2. 

4.7.1  Construction  and  Preconstruction  Activities 

Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  result  in  temporary  impacts 
to  local  air  quality.  Equipment  and  vehicle  emissions  from  these  activities  would  contain  carbon 
monoxide,  oxides  of  nitrogen,  volatile  organic  compounds  (VOCs),  and  oxides  of  sulfur  to  a 
lesser  extent.  Fugitive  dust  particle  emissions  (such  as  PMio  and  PM2.5;  that  is,  particulate 
matter  with  a  mean  aerodynamic  diameter  of  less  than  or  equal  to  10  and  2.5  pm,  respectively) 
would  be  generated  during  windy  periods,  earthmoving,  concrete  batch  plant  operation,  and 
movement  of  vehicular  traffic  over  recently  disturbed  or  cleared  areas.  The  site  grade  would  be 
made  uniform  to  ensure  access  to  all  areas  of  the  construction  site.  The  crosshatched  areas 
depicted  on  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  (Figure  2-2)  illustrate  the  areas  to  be  cleared, 
grubbed,  and  graded.  Painting,  coating,  and  similar  operations  would  also  generate  emissions 
of  VOCs.  Additionally,  construction  of  the  proposed  causeway  and  roadway  improvements  may 
generate  fugitive  dust  and  equipment  emissions. 

As  discussed  in  Section  2.9.2,  with  the  exception  of  the  8-hour  ozone  NAAQS,  air  quality  in 
Salem  County  is  in  attainment  with  or  better  than  national  standards  for  criteria  pollutants. 

Salem  County  is  in  nonattainment  of  the  8-hour  ozone  NAAQS;  therefore,  in  accordance  with 
Section  176(c)  of  the  Clean  Air  Act  (42  USC  7401  et  seq.  -TN1 141),  the  General  Conformity 
Rule  (40  CFR  Part  93  Subpart  B  [TN2495])  applies.  The  NRC,  the  USACE,  and  the  USCG 
must  analyze  the  proposed  permit  action  for  conformity  applicability  pursuant  to  40  CFR 
93.150(a).  As  discussed  in  Section  1.1,  the  ESP  application  and  review  processes  make  it 
possible  to  evaluate  and  resolve  safety  and  environmental  issues  related  to  siting  before  the 
applicant  makes  a  large  commitment  of  resources,  but  it  does  not  authorize  construction  and 
operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant.  The  Federal  action  of  issuing  an  ESP  for  the  PSEG  Site 
does  not  directly  or  indirectly  cause  any  emissions  according  to  the  definitions  in  40  CFR  93.152 


NUREG-2168

November  2015 


Construction  impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


(TN1495),  and  therefore,  an  applicability  analysis  and  potential  conformity  determination  will  not 
be  performed  at  this  time.  However,  the  preliminary  activities  listed  in  10  CFR  50.10(a)(2) 
(TN249),  which  do  not  fall  under  NRC  regulatory  authority,  could  occur  irrespective  of  the  ESP 
permit  issuance.  Compliance  with  40  CFR  Part  93,  Subpart  B  (TN2495),  will  be  demonstrated 
when  an  application  for  a  CP  or  COL  is  submitted  to  the  NRC. 

Authorizations  for  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  are  listed  in  Table  1.3-2  of  the  ER 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  State  of  New  Jersey  regulates  air  quality  through  the  New  Jersey 
Administrative  Code  (NJAC),  Title  7,  Environmental  Protection,  Chapter  27,  "Air  Pollution 
Control  (NJAC  7:27-TN3290).  The  applicant  must  follow  New  Jersey  reporting  requirements 
for  air  emissions  that  would  be  generated  during  construction  and  preconstruction  activities. 
Additionally,  the  applicant  plans  to  implement  a  fugitive  dust  control  program  and  plans  for 
proper  maintenance  of  construction  equipment  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  A  dust  control  program 
would  identify  specific  mitigation  measures  to  control  fugitive  dust.  Section  4. 4. 1.3  of  the  ER 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280)  lists  mitigation  measures  specifically  related  to  dust  control  that  may  be 
used,  including  the  following: 

•  stabilizing  construction  roads  and  spoil  piles, 

•  limiting  speeds  on  unpaved  construction  roads, 

•  periodically  watering  unpaved  construction  roads, 

•  performing  housekeeping  (e.g.,  removing  dirt  spilled  onto  paved  roads), 

•  covering  haul  trucks  when  loaded  or  unloaded, 

•  minimizing  material  handling  (e.g.,  drop  heights,  double  handling), 

•  phased  grading  to  minimize  the  area  of  disturbed  soils,  and 

•  revegetating  road  medians  and  slopes. 

PSEG  would  create  emission-specific  strategies  and  measures  to  comply  with  the  NAAQS 
(40  CFR  Part  50-TN1089)  and  the  National  Emission  Standards  for  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants 
(40  CFR  Part  63-TN1403),  to  which  stationary  sources  such  as  generators  are  subject. 

Construction  and  preconstruction  activities,  such  as  operation  of  on-road  construction  vehicles, 
commuter  vehicles,  nonroad  construction  equipment,  and  marine  engines,  would  also  result  in 
greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions,  principally  carbon  dioxide  (CO2).  Assuming  a  7-year  period 
for  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  and  typical  construction  practices,  the  review 
team  estimates  that  the  total  construction/preconstruction  equipment  GHG  emissions  footprint 
for  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  on  the  order  of  78,000  MT 
CO2  equivalent  (C026)1  (an  emission  rate  of  about  11,100  MT  C02e  annually,  averaged  over 
the  period  of  construction/preconstruction).  This  amounts  to  about  0.008  percent  of  the  total 
estimated  GHG  emissions  in  New  Jersey  (143,400,000  MT  of  gross2  C02e)  in  2010 
(NJDEP  2008-TN2776).  This  also  equates  to  about  0.0002  percent  of  the  total  U.S.  annual 
emission  rate  of  6.7  billion  MT  C02e  in  2011  (EPA  201 3-TN281 5).  Appendix  K  of  this  EIS 


(1)  A  measure  to  compare  the  emissions  from  various  greenhouse  gases  (GHGs)  on  the  basis  of  their 
global  warming  potential,  defined  as  the  ratio  of  heat  trapped  by  one  unit  mass  of  the  GHG  to  that  of 
one  unit  mass  of  CO2  over  a  specific  time  period.

provides  the  details  of  the  review  team  estimate  for  a  reference  1,000-MW(e)  nuclear  power 
reactor. 

Based  on  its  assessment  of  the  relatively  small  construction  equipment  GHG  footprint  compared 
to  total  New  Jersey  and  U.S.  annual  GHG  emissions,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the 
atmospheric  impacts  of  GHGs  from  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  would  not  be 
noticeable  and  additional  mitigation  would  not  be  warranted. 

In  general,  emissions  from  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  for  building  a  nuclear 
power  plant,  including  GHG  emissions,  would  vary  based  on  the  level  and  duration  of  a  specific 
activity,  but  the  overall  impact  is  expected  to  be  temporary  and  limited  in  magnitude.  PSEG 
asserted  in  ER  Section  4. 4. 1.3  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  that  emission-specific  strategies  and 
measures  would  be  developed  and  implemented  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  applicable 
regulatory  limits  defined  by  the  National  Primary  and  Secondary  Ambient  Air  Quality  Standards 
(40  CFR  Part  50-TN1089).  Additionally,  a  dust  control  program  would  be  implemented. 
Considering  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  its  stated  intent  to  develop  and  implement 
strategies  to  reduce  emissions  to  ensure  compliance  with  Federal,  State,  and  local  regulations, 
the  review  team  concludes  that  the  impacts  on  air  quality  from  PSEG  Site  construction  and 
preconstruction  activities  would  not  be  noticeable  because  appropriate  mitigation  measures 
would  be  adopted. 

4.7.2  Traffic  (Emissions) 

During  building  activities,  about  3,150  commuter  vehicles  and  50  additional  trucks  and  other 
vehicles  would  pass  through  Elsinboro  and  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Townships  and  Salem  City 
daily.  This  traffic  would  include  the  passenger  cars  and  light  duty  trucks  of  the  preconstruction 
and  construction  workforce  and  truck  traffic  for  delivery  of  construction  materials  and  heavy 
equipment  used  to  support  development  (e.g.,  excavators,  bulldozers,  heavy  haul  trucks, 
cranes).  Potential  effects  of  this  daily  traffic  are  considered  as  indirect  impacts  associated  with 
onsite  building  activities.  Workers  may  carpool  or  shuttle  to  the  site,  thereby  minimizing  the 
number  of  workers  using  the  causeway  and  other  roadways.  Additionally,  the  existing  HCGS 
barge  slip  and  the  proposed  parallel  barge  facility  would  be  used  to  deliver  larger  components 
(constructed  at  offsite  facilities)  and  construction  materials  to  the  site.  Because  the  workforce 
would  be  divided  into  three  shifts,  the  increased  traffic  would  be  distributed  over  the  day,  with 
only  periodic  and  short-term  increases  at  shift  changes.  As  a  result,  increases  in  emission  levels 
are  expected  to  be  minimal  and  temporary,  even  when  combined  with  the  workforce  for  the 
existing  HCGS  and  SGS,  and  would  have  a  minimal  impact  on  air  quality  from  criteria  pollutants. 

The  workforce  associated  with  PSEG  Site  building  activities  would  primarily  use  the  proposed 
causeway  to  avoid  disruption  to  the  HCGS  and  SGS  operations  workforce  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  The  TIA  (PSEG  2013-TN2525)  indicates  that  traffic  from  Salem  City  to  the  proposed 
causeway  would  be  greatest  during  shift  changes.  The  receiving  roadways  are  likely  to 
experience  a  significant  increase  in  traffic  during  shift  changes  that  could  lead  to  periods  of 
congestion  and  decreased  air  quality.  However,  the  overall  impact  caused  by  increased  traffic 
volume  and  congestion  would  be  localized  and  temporary.  In  the  ER,  PSEG  identifies 
mitigation  measures  that  would  be  developed  before  building  activities  begin.  These  traffic 
mitigation  measures  would  reduce  the  impact  of  increased  traffic  on  air  quality.  Potential 


NUREG-2168 


4-88 


November  2015 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


mitigation  measures  involve  changes  to  intersections  to  reduce  congestion.  After  building 
activities  are  complete,  the  measures  implemented  would  remain  in  place  and  continue  to 
reduce  congestion. 

Workforce  transportation  would  also  result  in  GHG  emissions,  principally  CO;.  Assuming  a 
7-year  period  for  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  and  a  typical  workforce,  the  review 
team  estimates  that  the  total  workforce  GHG  emission  footprint  for  building  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  on  the  order  of  86,000  MT  C02e  (an  emission  rate  of 
about  12.300  MT  C02e  annually,  averaged  over  the  period  of  construction/preconstruction). 

This  amounts  to  about  0.009  percent  of  the  total  estimated  GHG  emissions  in  New  Jersey 
(143,400,000  MT  of  gross  CC>2e)  in  2010  (NJDEP  2008-TN2776).  This  also  equates  to  about 
0.0002  percent  of  the  total  U.S.  annual  emission  rate  of  6.7  billion  MT  C02e  in  201 1 
(EPA  201 3-TN281 5).  Appendix  K  of  this  EIS  provides  the  details  of  the  review  team  estimate 
for  a  reference  1,000-MW(e)  nuclear  power  reactor. 

Based  on  its  assessment  of  the  relatively  small  construction  and  preconstruction  workforce 
GHG  footprint  compared  to  the  New  Jersey  and  U.S.  annual  GHG  emissions,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  the  atmospheric  impacts  of  GHGs  from  workforce  transportation  would  not  be 
noticeable,  and  additional  mitigation  would  not  be  warranted.  Based  on  the  limited  increase  in 
local  vehicle  traffic  and  the  applicant's  stated  intent  to  develop  mitigation  measures  listed  in  the 
PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  impact  on  the  air  quality 
related  to  construction  and  preconstruction  activities,  including  the  effect  of  GHG  emissions, 
would  be  temporary  and  would  not  be  noticeable  if  the  applicant's  proposed  mitigation 
measures  are  adopted. 

4.7.3  Summary 

The  review  team  evaluated  potential  impacts  on  air  quality  associated  with  criteria  pollutants 
and  GHG  emissions  during  PSEG  Site  development  activities.  The  review  team  determined 
that  the  impacts  would  be  minimal.  On  this  basis,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  impacts 
on  air  quality  from  emissions  of  criteria  pollutants  and  GHGs  during  PSEG  Site  development 
would  be  SMALL  and  that  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted.  Because  the 
NRC-authorized  construction  activities  represent  only  a  portion  of  the  analyzed  activities,  the 
NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  air-quality  impacts  of  the  NRC-authorized  construction  activities 
would  also  be  SMALL,  and  no  further  mitigation  beyond  those  mitigation  measures  that  the 
applicant  has  committed  to  implement  would  be  warranted. 

4.8  Nonradiological  Health  Impacts 

Nonradiological  health  impacts  on  the  public  and  workers  from  preconstruction  and  construction 
activities  include  exposure  to  dust  and  vehicle  exhaust,  occupational  injuries,  noise,  and  risk 
from  the  transport  of  materials  and  personnel  to  and  from  the  site.  PSEG  discussed  these 
impacts  qualitatively  in  Sections  4.4.1  and  4.6  of  the  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

The  area  around  the  PSEG  Site  is  predominantly  rural,  and  the  two  counties  located  within  a 
6-mi  radius  are  New  Castle,  Delaware,  and  Salem,  New  Jersey  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Most  of 
the  land  surrounding  the  site  is  owned  by  the  Federal  government  and  the  State  of  New  Jersey, 
and  three  major  land  uses  (agriculture,  open  water,  and  wetlands)  account  for  94  percent  of 


November  2015 


4-89 


NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


land  use  within  this  6-mile  vicinity.  About  42,000  people  reside  within  10  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site — 
the  majority  within  5  to  10  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  There  is  no  resident 
population  within  2  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site,  and  an  estimated  75  individuals  reside  within  2  to  3  mi. 
Of  the  roughly  1 ,300  people  employed  at  the  existing  facilities  (SGS  and  HCGS)  on  the  PSEG 
property,  the  majority  (82.6  percent)  live  in  four  counties  in  two  states.  These  counties  are 
Salem  County  (41.0  percent),  Gloucester  County  (14.6  percent),  and  Cumberland  County 
(10.0  percent)  in  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle  County  (17.0  percent)  in  Delaware  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  People  who  would  be  vulnerable  to  nonradiological  health  impacts  from 
preconstruction  and  construction  activities  include  construction  workers  and  personnel  working 
at  the  PSEG  Site;  people  working  or  living  in  the  vicinity  or  adjacent  to  the  site;  and  transient 
populations  in  the  vicinity  (e.g.,  temporary  employees,  recreational  visitors,  tourists). 

The  nonradiological  impacts  on  health  are  described  in  the  following  sections:  Section  4.8.1, 
impacts  on  public  and  occupational  health;  Section  4.8.2,  impacts  of  noise;  and  Section  4.8.3, 
impacts  of  transporting  construction  materials  and  personnel  to  and  from  the  PSEG  Site.  A 
summary  of  nonradiological  health  impacts  is  provided  in  Section  4.8.4. 

4.8.1  Public  and  Occupational  Health 

This  section  includes  a  discussion  of  the  impacts  of  site  preparation  and  construction  on  public 
health  and  worker  health. 

4. 8. 7.7  Public  Health 

The  physical  impacts  on  the  public  from  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  include  air  pollution  from  dust  and  vehicle  exhaust  during  site  preparation.  The  PSEG  ER 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280)  indicated  that  physical  impacts  to  the  public  from  construction  and 
preconstruction  on  the  PSEG  Site  are  unlikely  because  the  nearest  residences  to  the  center 
point  of  the  new  plant  are  located  2.8  mi  west  in  Delaware  and  3.4  mi  east-northeast  near 
Hancocks  Bridge,  New  Jersey.  PSEG  stated  that  operational  controls  would  be  imposed  to 
mitigate  dust  emissions  to  meet  State  requirements.  Further,  engine  exhaust  would  be 
minimized  by  maintaining  equipment  in  good  mechanical  order,  and  the  operation  of  vehicles 
and  other  combustion-engine  equipment  would  comply  with  applicable  standards,  regulations, 
and  requirements  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Because  there  are  no  residences  in  the  immediate 
proximity  of  the  new  plant  location,  noise,  dust,  exhaust  emissions  from  equipment  and 
vehicles,  and  vibration  from  onsite  construction  activities  would  be  unlikely  to  have  direct 
physical  impacts  on  the  public  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  in  Salem  County,  administratively  within  the  Metropolitan  Philadelphia 
Interstate  Air  Quality  Control  Region  (40  CFR  Part  81-TN255),  and  Salem  County  is  in 
attainment  with  NAAQSs  for  all  criteria  pollutants  except  8-hour  ozone,  for  which  it  is  in 
nonattainment.  Salem  County  is  adjacent  to  New  Castle  County,  Delaware,  which  is  a 
maintenance  area  for  PM2.5.  Temporary  and  minor  effects  on  local  ambient  air  quality  would 
occur  as  a  result  of  building  activities.  Dust  particle  emissions  would  be  generated  during  land¬ 
clearing,  grading,  and  excavation  activities.  Local  air  quality  would  also  be  affected  by  engine 
exhaust  emissions  and  concrete  batch  plant  operations.  PSEG  would  create  emission-specific 
strategies  and  measures  to  comply  with  National  Primary  and  Secondary  Ambient  Air  Quality 


NUREG-2168 


4-90 


November  2015 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Standards  (40  CFR  Part  50-TN1089)  and  National  Emission  Standards  for  Hazardous  Air 
Pollutants  (40  CFR  Part  63-TN1403).  Furthermore,  PSEG  indicates  it  would  create  a  dust 
control  program  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

An  increase  in  daily  traffic  (up  to  3,150  construction  worker  vehicles  and  50  trucks)  is  expected 
during  peak  construction  along  roads  passing  through  Elsinboro  and  Lower  Alloways  Creek 
Townships  and  Salem  City  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  This  traffic  would  include  passenger  cars 
and  light  duty  trucks  of  the  construction  workforce  as  well  as  truck  traffic  for  delivery  of 
construction  materials  and  heavy  equipment  used  to  support  facility  construction  (e.g., 
excavators,  bulldozers,  heavy  haul  trucks,  cranes).  Construction-related  traffic  could  expose 
people  living  or  working  along  these  roads  to  additional  emissions  and  noise.  Because  the 
construction  workforce  would  be  divided  into  three  shifts,  the  increased  traffic  would  be 
distributed  over  the  day  with  only  periodic  and  short-term  increases  at  shift  changes,  which 
would  result  in  increases  in  emissions  and  noise  levels.  Additionally,  the  existing  HCGS  barge 
slip  and  the  proposed  parallel  barge  facility  would  be  used  to  deliver  larger  components 
(constructed  at  offsite  facilities)  and  construction  materials  to  the  PSEG  Site.  Because  barge 
traffic  would  be  intermittent,  it  would  not  represent  a  significant  impact.  Impacts  to  fishermen 
and  boaters  on  the  Delaware  River  from  noise,  dust,  exhaust  emissions  from  equipment  and 
vehicles,  or  water  transport  during  onsite  building  activities  would  be  minimal. 

4. 8. 1.2  Public  Health  Impacts  from  Offsite  Building  Activities 

PSEG  has  identified  the  proposed  causeway  as  the  major  offsite  building  activity  with  potential 
impacts  to  public  health.  The  proposed  causeway  would  extend  to  the  northeast  from  the 
PSEG  Site  for  4.8  mi  and  pass  over  tidal  marshland  areas.  The  only  nearby  residences  are 
located  at  the  extreme  northern  end  of  the  proposed  causeway.  A  single  residence  is  located 
just  to  the  west  of  the  intersection  of  the  proposed  causeway  and  Mason  Point  Road.  Building 
the  causeway  and  any  improvements  of  connecting  roadways  may  expose  residents  of  this  and 
other  nearby  buildings  to  temporary  and  intermittent  increases  in  noise,  dust,  and  air  pollution 
emissions  associated  with  these  activities.  PSEG  states  that  construction  practices  and 
controls  would  be  used  to  minimize  fugitive  dust,  and  all  construction  equipment  would  meet 
appropriate  emissions  standards  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Most  building  activities  would  be 
during  the  day,  thereby  reducing  nighttime  noise  levels.  Traffic  associated  with  building  the 
causeway  would  potentially  have  physical  impacts  similar  to  those  described  for  building  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site.  However,  because  the  proposed  causeway  building 
period  would  be  limited  and  the  peak  workforce  would  be  less  than  10  percent  of  the  peak 
construction  workforce  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  potential  impacts  from  causeway  building 
traffic  to  public  health  would  be  minimal. 

Most  of  the  proposed  causeway  would  be  built  on  support  structures  to  elevate  the  roadway 
above  the  marsh  to  minimize  impacts  to  the  wetlands.  Activities  would  include  pile  driving,  form 
construction,  and  steel  and  concrete  work.  Emissions,  noise,  and  vibrations  would  be  the 
primary  potential  physical  impacts  from  construction  activities  (Table  4-18).  However,  impacts 
to  public  health  would  be  unlikely  because  there  are  no  homes  near  the  proposed  elevated 
portions  of  the  causeway  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Impacts  to  the  public  near  the  northern  at- 
grade  portions  of  the  proposed  causeway  from  emissions,  noise,  and  vibration  would  be 
minimal  and  temporary.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


4. 8. 1.3  Construction  Worker  Health 

In  general,  human  health  risks  for  construction  workers  and  other  personnel  working  on  the 
site  would  be  expected  to  be  dominated  by  occupational  injuries  (e.g.,  falls,  electrocution, 
asphyxiation)  to  workers  engaged  in  activities  such  as  construction,  maintenance,  and 
excavation.  Historically,  actual  injury  and  fatality  rates  at  nuclear  reactor  facilities  have  been 
lower  than  the  average  U.S.  industrial  rates.  According  to  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics 
(BLS  201 1-TN2425),  the  fatal  work  injury  rate  has  continued  a  gradual  drop  from  5.8  to  3.3  per 
100,000  workers  from  1992  through  2009.  PSEG  expects  that  the  construction  workforce  for  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  would  peak  at  4,100  during  the  projected  68-month  construction 
period,  with  construction  commencing  in  2016  and  a  2021  commercial  operation  date 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  To  meet  this  68-month  schedule,  the  workforce  would  be  divided  into 
three  shifts,  with  about  60  percent  working  on  the  first  shift  (days),  35  percent  on  the  second 
shift  (evenings),  and  5  percent  on  the  third  shift  (overnight).

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


While  statistical  rates  show  some  variation,  they  can  be  used  to  estimate  health  impacts  on  the 
construction  workers.  The  peak  labor  force  involved  in  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  was 
multiplied  by  2009  fatal  injury  rates  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  (If  the  current  trend  of  declining 
deaths  continues,  these  numbers  should  be  bounding.)  Using  the  BLS  fatal  injury  rate  for  the 
overall  workforce  and  for  the  construction  sector  (BLS  201 1-TN2425),  one  would  not  expect  a 
fatality  (0.13-0.39  expected  fatal  injuries)  during  the  years  of  construction  of  a  new  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  The  BLS  also  tracks  different  kinds  of  nonfatal  work  injuries  (BLS  2010-TN2731; 
BLS  2010-TN2427;  BLS  2010-TN2428).  Applying  the  2009  rates  to  the  same  workforce  over 
the  years  of  work  produced  the  projected  occupational  illnesses  and  injuries  in  Table  4-19.  The 
total  number  of  reportable  injuries  and  occupational  illnesses  could  range  from  148  to  160  over 
the  duration  of  construction  for  the  new  plant.  Projected  nonfatal  accidents  and  occupational 
illnesses  severe  enough  to  cause  days  away  from  work  would  be  much  smaller,  ranging  from  45 
to  86,  with  New  Jersey  utility  construction  again  near  the  lower  end  of  the  estimate.  When 
interpreting  these  results,  it  is  especially  important  to  recall  that  they  are  gross  (total)  injury 
estimates,  if  the  workers  were  not  employed  building  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  they  would 
be  doing  other  work  or  would  be  unemployed.  As  noted  previously,  the  injury  rate  for  utility 
construction  activities  in  New  Jersey  is  near  the  lower  end  of  the  estimate.  Thus,  the  estimates 
developed  above  are  conservative  estimates  of  the  net  impact  of  new  plant  construction 
activities  on  workplace  injuries.

In  addition  to  the  BLS  data,  site-specific  injury  data  associated  with  staff  contracted  to  support 
refueling  outages  at  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS  were  provided  by  PSEG  (PSEG  2012- 
TN2403).  The  work  activities  associated  with  a  refueling  outage  (e.g.,  electrical  work,  welding, 
scaffold  erection,  heavy  load  rigging)  are  representative  of  many  of  the  activities  associated  with 
construction  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  The  rotating  refueling  outage  schedule  for  the  three 
existing  nuclear  units  at  SGS  and  HCGS  is  such  that  one  of  the  units  is  in  an  outage  every 
6  months.  The  routine  schedule  of  outages  for  the  three  existing  units  makes  the  SGS  and 
HCGS  sites  unique  in  that  they  experience  a  consistent  recruitment  of  nominally  1,000 
contracted  labor  support  staff  from  the  region.  This  recurrent  outage  support  staff  represents  a 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


reasonable  surrogate  for  long-term  nuclear  power  plant  construction  staff.  Each  outage  at  SGS 
and  HCGS  requires  about  1 ,000  contracted  staff,  depending  on  the  scope  of  work  for  a  given 
outage,  a  majority  of  which  are  provided  by  a  primary  support  staff  contractor  for  PSEG.  Injury 
incident  data  for  the  PSEG  primary  support  staff  contractor  were  collected  between  January 
2009  and  August  2012.  During  this  time  frame  there  were  57  total  reported  injuries  over  the 
course  of  more  than  1.12  million  person-hours  worked.  These  injuries  were  experienced  over  a 
number  of  craft  types  (e.g.,  carpenters,  electricians,  insulators,  laborers)  and  were 
predominantly  minor  in  nature  (e.g.,  abrasions,  sprains,  insect  bites,  eye  irritation).  The  low 
incidence  of  PSEG  site-specific  workplace  injuries  during  outage  construction  activities 
suggests  future  construction  activities  would  have  minimal  impacts  on  worker  health. 

Other  nonradiological  impacts  on  workers  who  would  clear  land  or  build  the  facility  would 
include  noise,  fugitive  dust,  and  gaseous  emissions  resulting  from  site-preparation  and 
development  activities.  Table  4-18  provides  typical  noise  and  emission  levels  associated  with 
construction  equipment.  Mitigation  measures  discussed  for  the  public  would  also  help  limit 
exposure  to  construction  workers.  Onsite  impacts  on  workers  also  would  be  mitigated  through 
training  and  use  of  personal  protective  equipment  to  minimize  the  risk  of  potentially  harmful 
exposure.  The  NRC  staff  assumes  that  PSEG  would  adhere  to  all  applicable  NRC,  OSHA,  and 
State  safety  standards  and  procedures  during  preconstruction  and  construction  activities. 

4. 8. 1.4  Summary  of  Public  and  Construction  Worker  Health  Impacts 

Based  on  the  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280),  the  permits 
and  authorizations  required  by  State  and  local  agencies,  and  the  review  team’s  independent 
review,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  nonradiological  health  impacts  to  the  public  and 
workers  from  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  would  be  SMALL  and  that  additional 
mitigation  beyond  the  actions  stated  above  would  not  be  warranted. 

4.8.2  Noise  Impacts 

Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  for  a  nuclear  power  plant  are  similar  to  those  for 
other  large  industrial  projects  and  involve  many  noise-generating  activities.  Regulations 
governing  noise  from  construction-type  activities  are  generally  limited  to  protecting  workers’ 
hearing.  Federal  regulations  governing  construction  noise  are  found  in  29  CFR  Part  1910 
(TN654)  and  40  CFR  Part  204  (TN653).  The  regulations  in  29  CFR  Part  1910  deal  with  noise 
exposure  in  the  construction  environment,  and  the  regulations  in  40  CFR  Part  204  generally 
govern  the  noise  levels  of  compressors.  New  Jersey  also  has  established  protective  noise 
levels.  NJAC  7:29  includes  regulatory  limits  on  continuous  noise  levels  at  the  residential 
property  line  from  industrial,  commercial,  public  service,  or  community  service  facilities.  For 
continuous  noise  sources,  the  protective  level  is  65  dBA  during  the  day  and  50  dBA  during  the 
night  at  the  residential  property  line  (NJAC  7:29-TN2732).  The  similar  Delaware  limits 
(7  Del  Admin.  C.  §  1 149-TN3001)  provide  for  a  protective  level  of  65  dBA  during  the  day  and 
55  dBA  during  the  night  for  residential  receptors. 

PSEG  states  that  activities  associated  with  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  would  involve  equipment  producing  peak  noise  levels  of  102  dBA  at  50  ft 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  As  illustrated  in  Table  4-18,  noise  strongly  attenuates  with  distance. 


NUREG-2168 


4-94 


November  2015 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Noise  levels  for  construction  equipment  typically  found  during  building  activities  at  a  nuclear 
power  plant  are  reduced  by  30  dBA  over  a  distance  of  1 ,450  ft.  A  10-dBA  decrease  in  noise 
level  is  generally  perceived  as  cutting  the  loudness  in  half.  For  context,  Tipler  and  Mosca 
(Tipler  and  Mosca  2008-TN1467)  list  the  sound  intensity  of  a  quiet  office  as  50  dBA,  normal 
conversation  as  60  dBA,  busy  traffic  as  70  dBA,  and  a  noisy  office  with  machines  or  an  average 
factory  as  80  dBA.  Construction  noise  (at  10  ft)  is  listed  as  1 10  dBA,  and  the  pain  threshold  is 
120  dBA. 

Based  on  the  peak  construction  noise  levels  of  102  dBA  at  50  ft  and  the  natural  attenuation  of 
noise  levels  over  distance,  the  bounding  condition  construction  noise  level  would  fall  below  the 
New  Jersey  daytime  standard  (65  dBA)  between  3,000  and  4,000  ft  from  the  source 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  closest  residences  and  recreation  areas  are  more  than  2  mi  from 
the  PSEG  Site.  Further,  noise  mitigation  could  be  accomplished  by  maintaining  equipment, 
verifying  that  noise  control  equipment  on  vehicles  and  equipment  is  in  proper  working  order,  and 
restricting  noise-  and  vibration-generating  activities  to  daylight  hours.  Occupational  exposure 
would  be  monitored,  and  construction  personnel  would  be  provided  with  hearing  protection 
when  appropriate. 

According  to  NUREG-1437  (NRC  1996-TN288),  noise  levels  below  60  to  65  dBA  are 
considered  to  be  of  small  significance.  More  recently,  the  impacts  of  noise  were  considered  in 
NUREG-0586,  Supplement  1  (NRC  2002-TN665).  The  criterion  for  assessing  the  level  of 
significance  was  not  expressed  in  terms  of  sound  levels  but  based  on  the  effect  of  noise  on 
human  activities.  The  criterion  in  NUREG-0586,  Supplement  1,  is  stated  as  follows: 

Noise  impacts  are  considered  detectable  if  sound  levels  are  sufficiently  high  to 
disrupt  normal  human  activities  on  a  regular  basis.  The  noise  impacts  are 
considered  destabilizing  if  sound  levels  are  sufficiently  high  that  the  affected  area 
is  essentially  unsuitable  for  normal  human  activities,  or  if  the  behavior  or 
breeding  of  a  threatened  and  endangered  species  is  affected. 

Considering  the  temporary  nature  of  construction  activities  and  the  location  and  characteristics 
of  the  PSEG  Site,  the  review  team  concludes  that  noise  impacts  from  preconstruction  and 
construction  activities  would  be  SMALL  and  that  no  further  mitigation  beyond  the  actions 
identified  above  would  be  warranted. 

4.8.3  Impacts  of  Transporting  Construction  Materials  and  Construction  Personnel  to 
the  PSEG  Site 

This  EIS  assesses  the  impact  of  transporting  workers  and  materials  to  and  from  the  PSEG  Site 
from  three  perspectives:  socioeconomic  impacts,  air-quality  impacts  resulting  from  the  dust  and 
particulate  matter  emitted  by  vehicle  traffic,  and  potential  health  impacts  caused  by  additional 
traffic-related  accidents.  The  socioeconomic  impacts  are  addressed  in  Section  4.4,  and  the  air- 
quality  impacts  are  addressed  in  Section  4.7.  The  human  health  impacts  are  addressed  in  this 
section  and  in  Section  4.9.  The  assumptions  that  were  made  to  determine  reasonable 
estimates  of  nonradiological  impacts  from  transportation  during  construction  are  discussed 
below.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


To  develop  representative  commuter  traffic  impacts,  traffic  accident,  injury,  and  fatality  rates  for 
New  Jersey,  data  were  obtained  from  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Transportation 
(NJDOT  2012-TN2430)  and  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation,  National  Highway  Traffic 
Safety  Administration  (NHTSA  2012-TN2429),  for  the  years  2006  to  2010.  The  New  Jersey 
traffic  statistics  indicate  there  are  3.63  accidents,  0.88  injuries,  and  0.77  fatalities  per  100  million 
vehicle  miles  (NJDOT  2012-TN2430).  The  estimated  impacts  of  transporting  construction 
workers  to  and  from  the  PSEG  Site  are  shown  in  Table  4-20.  The  total  annual  traffic  fatalities 
during  construction  are  estimated  to  be  less  than  0.21.  There  may  be  0.24  injuries  from  traffic 
accidents  associated  with  transport  of  the  construction  workforce.  The  addition  of  vehicles 
associated  with  personnel  performing  construction  activities  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  is  expected  to  result  in  a  minimal  increase  relative  to  the  current  traffic  accident 
injury  risk  in  the  area  surrounding  the  PSEG  Site.  The  implementation  of  mitigation  measures 
identified  in  Section  4.4  would  reduce  the  potential  for  traffic  accidents  in  the  area  surrounding 
the  PSEG  Site.

Traffic  associated  with  the  construction  workforce  traveling  to  and  from  the  PSEG  Site  would 
also  generate  noise.  The  construction  workforce  would  work  in  shifts,  with  the  largest  shift 
working  during  the  day.  Smaller  shifts  would  work  in  the  evening  and  night.  Because  of  this, 
the  increase  in  noise  relative  to  background  conditions  would  likely  be  most  noticeable  during 
shift  changes  in  the  morning  and  late  afternoon.  Posted  speed  limits,  traffic  control,  and 
administrative  measures  such  as  staggered  shift  hours  would  be  used  to  reduce  traffic  noise 
during  weekday  business  hours.  Potential  noise  impacts  to  the  community  would  be  intermittent 
and  limited  primarily  to  shift  changes.  Therefore,  human  health  impacts  from  noise  would  be 
minimal. 

Large  components  and  equipment  would  be  transported  by  barge  and  delivered  to  a  barge¬ 
unloading  facility  constructed  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Construction  of  this  unloading  facility  would  not 
result  in  impacts  to  the  public  because  its  location  is  in  an  access-restricted  area  of  the  PSEG 
Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Also,  a  concrete  batch  plant  would  be  located  on  the  PSEG  Site 
during  construction,  thus  further  reducing  the  number  of  trucks  needed  for  transport  of  materials 
during  construction  activities  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant. 

The  use  of  barges  for  transporting  large  components  and  equipment  to  the  PSEG  Site  and  the 
onsite  concrete  batch  plant  would  reduce  the  number  of  trucks  needed  for  construction 
activities.  Based  on  these  factors,  the  information  provided  by  PSEG,  and  the  review  team’s 
independent  evaluation,  the  review  team  concludes  that  impacts  of  transporting  building 
materials  and  personnel  to  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  during  preconstruction 
and  construction  activities  would  have  minimal  nonradiological  health  impacts.  The  NRC  staff 
also  concludes  that  no  further  mitigation  measures  beyond  those  proposed  by  PSEG  would  be 
warranted.

4.8.4  Summary  of  Nonradiological  Health  Impacts 

The  review  team  evaluated  the  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280)  and  the  permits  and  authorizations  required  by  State  and  local  agencies  to  build  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review  team  also  evaluated  impacts  on  public  health 
and  on  construction  workers  from  fugitive  dust,  occupational  injuries,  noise,  and  the  transport  of 
materials  and  personnel  to  the  PSEG  Site.  No  significant  impacts  related  to  the  nonradiological 
health  of  staff  or  personnel  were  identified  during  the  course  of  this  review. 

On  the  basis  of  information  provided  in  the  PSEG  ER  and  the  review  team’s  independent 
evaluation,  the  review  team  concludes  that  nonradiological  health  impacts  from  noise,  air 
quality,  and  occupational  injuries  from  preconstruction-  and  construction-related  activities  for  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  minimal.  Use  of  the  proposed  causeway  for  construction 
traffic,  implementation  of  proposed  improvements  to  roads,  and  installation  of  traffic  signals  and 
improved  traffic  patterns  would  reduce  transportation  impacts  associated  with  building-related 
activities.  On  the  basis  of  the  above  analysis,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  impacts  on 
nonradiological  health  would  be  SMALL,  and  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

4.9  Radiation  Health  Impacts 

Potential  sources  of  radiation  exposure  for  construction  workers  during  the  site-preparation  and 
construction  phases  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  include 
direct  radiation;  liquid  radioactive  waste  discharges;  and  gaseous  radioactive  effluents  from  the 
first  new  nuclear  unit  (if  a  multiunit  design,  such  as  the  API 000,  is  selected),  SGS  Units  1  and 
2,  and  HCGS  Unit  1 .  For  the  purposes  of  this  discussion,  construction  and  site-preparation 
workers  are  assumed  to  be  members  of  the  public.  Therefore,  the  dose  estimates  are 
compared  to  the  dose  limits  for  the  public,  pursuant  to  10  CFR  Part  20,  Subpart  D  (TN283). 

4.9.1  Direct  Radiation  Exposures 

In  the  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280),  PSEG  identified  three  sources  of  direct  radiation  exposure 
from  the  site:  (1)  casks  loaded  into  the  onsite  independent  spent  fuel  storage  installation 
(ISFSI),  (2)  SGS  Units  1  and  2  and  HCGS  Unit  1 ,  and  (3)  the  first  AP1000  unit  (if  an  AP1000 
design  is  chosen).  The  first  API  000  unit  would  be  placed  in  service  during  construction  of  the 
second  API 000  unit,  so  direct  radiation  from  the  first  unit  must  be  considered. 

PSEG  used  fence  line  thermoluminescent  dosimeters  (TLDs)  and  environmental  TLDs  to 
measure  direct  radiation  levels  at  locations  in  and  around  the  protected  area.  Direct  radiation 
dose  measurements  from  SGS  and  HCGS  were  taken  at  the  north  TLD  station  (1  SI)  with  an 
average  monthly  reading  of  4.77  mrem  resulting  in  an  equivalent  annual  dose  of  57.2  mrem 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  This  is  comparable  to  the  preoperational  dose  of  55  mrem/yr. 

Assuming  continuous  occupancy  would  result  in  an  annual  direct  radiation  dose  from  SGS  and 
HCGS  of  approximately  2.2  mrem.  Based  on  a  2,400-hour  work  year  for  a  construction  worker, 
PSEG  calculated  this  direct  radiation  pathway  would  provide  for  an  annual  construction  worker 
dose  of  about  0.6  mrem  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Direct  radiation  exposure  from  the  ISFSI  was  calculated  by  PSEG  using  the  Monte  Carlo 
N-Particle  computer  code,  considering  a  conservative  scenario  with  the  ISFSI  fully  loaded  with 
200  HI-STORM  100S  Version  B  (Model  100S-218)  storage  casks  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Doses  were  determined  at  distances  of  1 0  and  25  m  north  of  the  ISFSI  pad  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  Direct  radiation  doses  from  the  ISFSI  are  monitored  and  minimized  by  administrative 
controls  such  as  cask  loading  procedures  that  maximize  shielding  and  physical  barriers  such  as 
a  fence  to  establish  a  standoff  distance  that  minimizes  construction  worker  dose  to  remain 
within  regulatory  limits.  Administrative  controls  for  loading  the  ISFSI  limit  doses  from  exceeding 
1 00  mrem/yr  at  the  ISFSI  fence,  1 0  m  north  of  the  ISFSI  pad.  Based  on  this  dose  limit,  doses 
for  construction  workers  were  adjusted  for  the  25  m  location  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

As  provided  in  ER  Table  4.5-8,  the  annual  worker  dose  from  the  ISFSI  was  estimated  to  be 
10.3  mrem  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

If  a  dual-unit  API  000  is  selected  for  the  PSEG  Site,  one  unit  would  be  placed  in  service  while 
construction  workers  were  working  on  the  second  unit.  PSEG  calculated  the  direct  radiation 
doses  for  construction  workers  at  the  second  API  000  using  the  distance  of  800  ft  from  the  first 
API  000  containment  centerline  (the  expected  minimum  distance  between  containment  building 
centerlines).  The  shield  building  wall  and  compartment  shield  walls  for  the  reactor  vessel  and 
steam  generators  would  reduce  the  radiation  levels  outside  of  the  shield  building  to  less 
than  0.25  mrem/hr  according  to  the  API  000  Design  Certification  Document  (DCD) 
(Westinghouse  201 1 -TN261 ).  The  API  000  DCD  also  provides  a  nominal  distance  of  72.5  ft 
between  the  outside  surface  of  the  shield  building  wall  and  the  building’s  centerline 
(Westinghouse  201 1-TN261).  PSEG  applied  an  inverse  square  distance  model  to  the  AP1000 
DCD  dose  rate  to  determine  the  dose  rate  at  800  ft  from  the  first  containment  building  centerline 
along  with  an  adjustment  for  the  estimated  2,400-hour  work  year  for  a  construction  worker.  The 
resulting  annual  construction  worker  dose  was  estimated  by  PSEG  to  be  about  4.9  mrem 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

In  addition,  at  certain  times  during  construction,  PSEG  would  receive,  possess,  and  use  specific 
radioactive  by-product,  source,  and  special  nuclear  material  in  support  of  construction  and 
preparations  for  operation.  These  sources  of  low-level  radiation  are  required  to  be  controlled  by 
the  applicant’s  radiation  protection  program,  with  physical  protections  if  necessary,  and  have 
very  specific  uses  under  controlled  conditions.  Therefore,  these  sources  are  expected  to  result 
in  a  negligible  contribution  to  construction  worker  doses. 

4.9.2  Radiation  Exposures  from  Gaseous  Effluents 

Gaseous  radioactive  effluents  from  SGS  Units  1  and  2  are  released  at  a  plant  vent  receiving 
discharges  from  the  waste  gas  holdup  system,  condenser  evacuation  system,  containment 
purge  and  pressure/vacuum  relief  vents,  and  auxiliary  building  ventilation.  Gaseous  radioactive 
effluents  from  HCGS  are  released  at  the  north  plant  vent  and  the  south  plant  vent.  A  small 
amount  of  gaseous  radioactive  effluents  is  also  released  from  the  filtration,  recirculation,  and 
ventilation  system  vent  during  testing  periods. 

Gaseous  radioactive  releases  are  reported  to  the  NRC  annually.  The  gaseous  activity  emitted 
from  HCGS  and  SGS  Units  1  and  2  are  shown  in  Tables  1 A  and  1C  of  the  PSEG  Nuclear  LLC 
2008  Annual  Radioactive  Effluent  Release  Report  for  the  Salem  and  Hope  Creek  Generating 


NUREG-2168

November  2015 


Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Stations  (PSEG  2009-TN2730).  This  year  was  selected  by  PSEG  as  being  an  acceptable  basis 
for  estimating  the  normal  effluent  releases  during  construction  due  to,  in  part,  the  operating 
record  of  the  HCGS  and  SGS  units  that  year  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Using  the  2008  gaseous 
effluent  data  and  the  methods  in  the  PSEG  Offsite  Dose  Calculation  Manual  (PSEG  2010- 
TN2741),  the  estimated  dose  from  the  2008  gaseous  effluents  (submersion  in  cloud,  inhalation, 
and  deposition)  from  SGS  and  HCGS  was  determined  by  PSEG  to  be  less  than  0.01  mrem 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

For  the  case  of  two  API 000  units,  the  first  API  000  unit  would  be  placed  in  service  during 
construction  of  the  second  API  000  unit,  so  gaseous  effluents  must  be  considered.  The 
estimated  air  doses  are  based  on  a  postulated  DCD  atmospheric  dispersion  factor  (-// Q).  The 
doses  were  altered  for  site-specific  conditions  by  multiplying  them  by  the  ratio  of  the  site-specific 
dispersion  factor  to  the  DCD  dispersion  factor.  By  applying  a  y/Q  of  1 .6  *  1 0"5  s/m3 
(Westinghouse  201 1 -TN261 ),  and  the  hours  in  a  work  year  (2,400  hours),  PSEG  calculated  the 
annual  construction  worker  dose  for  gaseous  effluents  from  the  first  API  000  to  be  about 
2.67  mrem  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

4.9.3  Radiation  Exposures  from  Liquid  Effluents 

Liquid  radioactive  effluents  discharged  to  the  Delaware  River  were  evaluated  for  their 
contribution  to  the  total  effective  dose  equivalent  to  construction  workers.  The  principal 
exposure  pathways  are  fish  ingestion,  boating,  swimming,  and  shoreline  use  on  and  near  the 
Delaware  River.  There  are  no  dose  contributions  from  drinking  water  because  the  brackish 
water  of  the  Delaware  River  near  the  PSEG  Site  is  not  potable.  As  done  for  the  gaseous 
effluents,  PSEG  obtained  doses  from  liquid  effluents  from  the  PSEG  Nuclear  LLC  2008  Annual 
Radioactive  Effluent  Release  Report  for  the  Salem  and  Hope  Creek  Generating  Stations 
(PSEG  2009-TN2730).  Using  the  2008  liquid  effluent  data  (PSEG  2009-TN2730)  and  the 
methods  in  the  Offsite  Dose  Calculation  Manual  (PSEG  2010-TN2741),  the  estimated  annual 
construction  worker  whole  body  dose  from  liquid  effluents  of  HCGS  and  SGS  was  estimated  to 
be  less  than  0.01  mrem  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  For  the  case  of  two  AP1000  units,  PSEG 
applied  the  same  dose  from  this  pathway  as  that  for  members  of  the  public  from  liquid  effluents 
from  the  first  API  000  unit.  By  assuming  construction  workers  would  have  the  same  recreational 
and  consumption  patterns,  PSEG  estimated  an  annual  dose  of  about  0.19  mrem  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

4.9.4  Total  Dose  to  Site-Preparation  Workers 

PSEG  estimated  maximum  annual  total  effective  dose  equivalent  to  a  construction  worker  to  be 
about  1 8.7  mrem  based  on  a  2,400-hour  work  year  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  This  is  the  sum  of 
seven  sources:  (1)  SGS  and  HCGS  direct  sources,  (2)  ISFSI  direct  sources,  (3)  API 000  direct 
sources,  (4)  SGS  and  HCGS  gaseous  effluents,  (5)  AP1000  gaseous  effluents,  (6)  SGS  and 
HCGS  liquid  effluents,  and  (7)  API 000  liquid  effluents  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  This  estimate  is 
well  within  the  dose  limit  to  an  individual  member  of  the  public  (100  mrem  in  a  year)  found  in 
10  CFR  20.1301  (TN283).  The  maximum  estimated  annual  collective  dose  to  site-preparation 
workers,  based  on  an  annual  individual  dose  of  about  18.7  mrem  and  an  estimated  maximum 
workforce  of  4,100,  would  be  about  77  person-rem  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

4.9.5  Summary  of  Radiological  Health  Impacts 

The  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  estimates  of  doses  to  construction  workers  during  site- 
preparation  and  construction  activities  are  well  within  the  NRC  annual  exposure  limits  (i.e., 

100  mrem)  designed  to  protect  the  public  health.  Based  on  information  provided  by  PSEG  and 
the  NRC  staff’s  independent  evaluation,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  radiological  health 
impacts  to  construction  workers  engaged  in  building  activities  related  to  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL,  and  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

4.10  Nonradioactive  Waste  Impacts 

This  section  describes  the  environmental  impacts  that  could  result  from  the  generation, 
handling,  and  disposal  of  nonradioactive  waste  during  building  activities  for  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  types  of  nonradioactive  waste  that  would  be  generated, 
handled,  and  disposed  of  during  building  activities  would  include  construction  debris,  municipal 
waste,  excavation  spoils,  and  sanitary  waste.  The  potential  impacts  resulting  from  these  types 
of  wastes  are  assessed  in  the  following  sections. 

4.10.1  Impacts  to  Land 

Building  activities  related  to  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  generate  wastes  such  as 
construction  debris  and  spoils  (i.e.,  earthen  debris,  including  soil  and  rock).  These  materials 
would  be  sorted  at  the  PSEG  Site;  the  majority  would  be  reclaimed  as  recyclable  or  reusable 
material  and  the  remainder  disposed  of  in  appropriate  landfills.  Furthermore,  PSEG  currently 
implements  a  successful  waste-minimization  plan  for  SGS  and  HCGS  and  proposes  to  apply 
this  plan  to  building  activities  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2012- 
TN2458). 

PSEG  would  not  allow  open  burning  of  refuse,  garbage,  or  any  other  waste  material  on  the  site. 
The  solid  waste  would  be  taken  to  the  nearest  suitable  landfill  for  disposal  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  Hazardous  and  nonhazardous  solid  wastes  would  be  managed  according  to  county 
and  State  handling  and  transportation  regulations.  Consistent  with  current  PSEG  practice,  solid 
wastes  would  be  reused  or  recycled  to  the  extent  possible.  Wastes  appropriate  for  recycling  or 
reclamation  (e.g.,  used  oil,  antifreeze,  scrap  metal,  universal  wastes)  would  be  managed  using 
approved,  licensed  contractors.  Nonradioactive  solid  waste  destined  for  offsite  landfill  disposal 
would  be  handled  according  to  county,  State,  and  Federal  regulations  and  disposed  of  at 
approved,  licensed  offsite  commercial  waste  disposal  sites.  County  and  State  permits  and 
regulations  for  the  handling  and  disposal  of  solids  would  be  obtained  and  implemented.  The 
review  team  expects  that  solid-waste  impacts  would  be  minimal  and  that  additional  mitigation 
would  not  be  warranted. 

Based  on  the  waste  management  and  minimization  program  already  in  place  for  HCGS  and 
SGS  and  PSEG  plans  to  manage  solid  and  liquid  wastes  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  in  a 
similar  manner  and  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  Federal,  State,  and  local  requirements  and 
standards,  the  review  team  expects  that  impacts  to  land  from  nonradioactive  wastes  generated 
during  building  would  be  minimal  and  that  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted.

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


4.10.2  Impacts  to  Water 

Surface-water  runoff  from  site  development  activities  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  would  be  controlled  and  managed  according  to  existing  water  and  wastewater  treatment 
procedures  at  SGS  and  HCGS  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG  currently  maintains  engineering 
and  procedural  controls  that  prevent  or  minimize  the  release  of  harmful  levels  of  wastewater 
constituents  to  the  Delaware  River  watershed  consistent  with  Federal,  State  and  local 
requirements,  including  those  of  the  DRBC  related  to  surface-water  regulations  (72  FR  46931- 
TN2736).  There  would  be  an  increase  in  the  generation  of  sanitary  wastewater,  but  discharges 
from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  are  expected  to  be  minor  and  would  not  warrant  mitigation 
given  the  small  volume  of  these  constituents,  the  capacity  of  the  existing  wastewater  treatment 
system,  the  large  volume  of  the  receiving  water  body  (the  Delaware  River),  and  the  regular  tidal 
mixing  that  occurs  within  the  Delaware  River  adjacent  to  and  downstream  of  the  PSEG  Site. 

Chemical  treatment  of  the  safety-related  cooling  water  system  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  with  biocides,  dispersants,  molluskicides,  and  scale  inhibitors  would  be  required 
on  a  periodic  basis.  These  chemicals  are  subject  to  review  and  approval  for  use  by  NJDEP, 
and  wastewater  discharges  to  surface  water  would  comply  with  the  NJPDES  permit.  The  total 
residual  chemical  concentrations  in  the  discharges  to  the  Delaware  River  watershed  are  subject 
to  limits  established  by  NJDEP  that  are  deemed  protective  of  the  water  quality  of  the  Delaware 
River  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Stormwater  discharges  associated  with  building  activities  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would 
require  an  NJPDES  permit  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  PSEG  states  that  in  addition  to  the 
application  for  the  NJPDES  permit,  it  would  implement  an  SWPPP  designed  to  prevent  the 
discharge  of  harmful  quantities  of  pollutants  with  stormwater  discharge.  The  SWPPP  would 
follow  EPA  guidance  (EPA  1992-TN3300)  and  the  current  version  of  New  Jersey  Stormwater 
Best  Management  Practices  (NJDEP  2009-TN3221).  This  SWPPP  would  incorporate  drainage 
from  all  areas  and  facilities  associated  with  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
and  would  be  consistent  with  the  existing  SWPPPs  at  HCGS  and  SGS  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Based  on  the  existing  regulated  practices  for  PSEG's  management  of  liquid  discharges  for 
HCGS  and  SGS.  including  sanitary  wastewater,  and  the  plans  for  managing  stormwater,  the 
review  team  expects  that  impacts  to  water  from  nonradioactive  effluents  when  building  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minimal,  and  additional  mitigation  would  not  be 
warranted. 

4.10.3  Impacts  to  Air 

As  discussed  in  Sections  4. 4. 1.1  and  4.7.1,  PSEG  would  need  to  manage  fugitive  dust 
generated  during  preconstruction  and  construction  activities.  PSEG  would  use  air-quality 
protection  procedures  to  minimize  the  generation  of  fugitive  dust  and  the  release  of  emissions 
from  equipment  and  vehicles  and  comply  with  local  permits  from  the  NJDEP  Division  of  Air 
Quality. 

The  construction  environmental  controls  would  include  managing  the  use  of  unpaved  roads 
(speed  limits,  use  of  dust  suppression,  and  minimization  of  dirt  tracking  onto  paved  roads);

Construction  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


covering  haul  trucks;  phasing  grading  activities  to  minimize  the  exposed  amount  of  disturbed 
soils;  stabilizing  roads  and  excavated  areas  with  coarse  material  covers  or  vegetation;  and 
performing  proper  maintenance  of  vehicles,  generators,  and  other  equipment. 

Based  on  the  regulated  practices  for  managing  air  emissions  from  construction  equipment  and 
temporary  stationary  sources,  BMPs  for  controlling  fugitive  dust,  and  vehicle  inspection  and 
traffic  management  plans,  the  review  team  expects  that  impacts  to  air  from  nonradioactive 
emissions  while  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minimal. 
However,  additional  mitigation  may  be  warranted,  depending  on  the  outcome  of  the  NRC, 
USACE,  and  USCG’s  conformity  applicability  analyses,  which  are  required  by,  pursuant  to  the 
Clean  Air  Act  Section  176  (42  USC  7401  et  seq.  -TN1 141 )  and  40  CFR  Part  93,  Subpart  B 
(TN2495). 

4.10.4  Summary  of  Impacts 

Solid,  liquid,  and  gaseous  wastes  generated  when  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  would  be  managed  by  following  the  practices  currently  used  by  PSEG  during  the 
operation  of  HCGS  and  SGS  and  would  be  in  compliance  with  county,  State,  and  Federal 
regulations.  County  and  State  permits  and  regulations  for  handling  and  disposal  of  solid  and 
liquid  waste  would  ensure  compliance  with  the  CWA  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662),  NJDEP 
limits  and  requirements,  and  DRBC  water-quality  standards.  Solid  waste  would  be  recycled  or 
disposed  of  in  existing,  permitted  landfills.  Sanitary  wastes  would  be  treated  on  the  site  and 
discharged  locally  after  being  treated  to  the  levels  stipulated  in  the  NJPDES  permit.  An  SWPPP 
would  specify  the  mitigation  measures  to  be  put  in  place  to  manage  stormwater  runoff.  To  avoid 
any  noticeable  offsite  air-quality  impacts,  the  use  of  BMPs  to  control  dust  and  minimize  engine 
exhaust  emissions  would  be  expected. 

Based  on  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  evaluation,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  nonradioactive  waste  impacts  on  land,  water,  and  air  from  building 
activities  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL  and  that 
additional  mitigation  would  not  be  warranted. 

4.11  Measures  and  Controls  to  Limit  Adverse  Impacts  During  Construction 
Activities 

In  its  evaluation  of  environmental  impacts  during  building  activities  for  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  the  review  team  considered  PSEG’s  stated  intention  to  comply  with  the 
following  measures  and  controls  that  would  limit  adverse  environmental  impacts: 

•  compliance  with  applicable  Federal,  State,  and  local  laws,  ordinances,  and  regulations 
intended  to  prevent  or  minimize  adverse  environmental  impacts  (e.g.,  solid-waste 
management,  erosion  and  sediment  control,  air  emissions  control,  noise  control,  stormwater 
management,  discharge  prevention  and  response,  hazardous  material  management); 

•  compliance  with  applicable  requirements  of  permits  or  licenses  required  for  construction  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (e.g.,  DA  Section  404  Permit,  NPDES  permit); 

•  compliance  with  existing  PSEG  processes  and/or  procedures  applicable  for  environmental 
compliance  activities  during  construction  and  preconstruction  at  the  PSEG  Site  (e.g.,  solid-

waste  management,  hazardous  waste  management,  and  discharge  prevention  and 
response); 

•  incorporation  of  environmental  requirements  into  construction  contracts;  and 

•  identification  of  environmental  resources  and  potential  impacts  during  the  ESP  process  and 
the  development  of  revisions  to  the  PSEG  ER. 

Examples  of  PSEG's  stated  measures  to  minimize  impacts  and  protect  the  environment  include 
the  following: 

•  using  BMPs  for  construction  and  preconstruction  activities; 

•  implementing  plans  to  manage  stormwater  and  to  prevent  and  appropriately  address 
accidental  spills; 

•  managing  and/or  restoring  wetlands  and  marsh  creek  channels;  and 

•  adhering  to  Federal,  State,  and  local  permitting  requirements. 

The  review  team  considered  these  measures  and  controls  in  its  evaluation  of  the  impacts  of 
building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Table  4-21 ,  which  is  based  on 
Table  4.6-1  in  the  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  and  other  information  provided  by  the  applicant, 
summarizes  the  measures  and  controls  to  limit  adverse  impacts  when  building  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant.  Some  measures  apply  to  more  than  one  impact  category.

4.12  Summary  of  Preconstruction  and  Construction  Impacts 

The  impact  category  levels  determined  by  the  review  team  in  the  previous  sections  are 
summarized  in  Table  4-22.  The  impact  category  levels  for  the  NRC-authorized  construction 
discussed  in  this  chapter  are  denoted  in  the  table  as  SMALL,  MODERATE,  or  LARGE  as  a 
measure  of  their  expected  adverse  environmental  impacts,  if  any.  Impact  levels  for  the 
combined  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  are  similarly  noted.  Some  impacts,  such 
as  the  addition  of  tax  revenue  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  to  the  local 
economies,  are  likely  to  be  beneficial  and  are  noted  as  such  in  the  “Impact  Level”  columns.

5.0  OPERATIONAL  IMPACTS  AT  THE  PROPOSED  SITE 


This  chapter  examines  environmental  issues  associated  with  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Power,  LLC  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG)  Site  as  described  by  the 
applicant,  PSEG.  Although  an  early  site  permit  (ESP)  would  not  authorize  construction  or 
operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant,  as  part  of  its  application  for  an  ESP,  PSEG  submitted  an 
Environmental  Report  (ER)  that  discusses  the  environmental  impacts  of  station  operation  for  an 
initial  40-year  period  assuming  the  future  issuance  of  a  combined  license  (COL)  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  In  their  evaluation  of  operational  impacts,  the  staffs  of  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory 
Commission  (NRC)  and  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  (hereafter  known  as  the 
“review  team")  relied  on  operational  details  supplied  by  PSEG  in  its  ER  and  its  responses  to 
NRC  Requests  for  Additional  Information  (RAIs). 

This  chapter  is  divided  into  13  sections.  Sections  5.1  through  5.12  discuss  the  potential 
operational  impacts  on  land  use,  water,  terrestrial  and  aquatic  ecosystems,  socioeconomics, 
environmental  justice,  historic  and  cultural  resources,  meteorology  and  air  quality, 
nonradiological  health  effects,  radiological  health  effects,  nonradioactive  waste,  postulated 
accidents,  and  applicable  measures  and  controls  that  would  limit  the  adverse  impacts  of  station 
operation  during  an  assumed  40-year  operating  period.  Section  5.13  provides  a  summary  of 
operational  impacts. 

In  accordance  with  Title  10  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  51  (10  CFR  Part  51- 
TN250),  impacts  have  been  analyzed,  and  a  significance  level  of  potential  adverse  impacts 
(i.e.,  SMALL,  MODERATE,  or  LARGE)  has  been  assigned  by  the  review  team  to  each  impact 
category.  In  the  area  of  socioeconomics  related  to  taxes,  the  impacts  may  be  considered 
beneficial  and  are  stated  as  such.  The  review  team’s  determination  of  significance  levels  is 
based  on  the  assumption  that  the  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  ER  or  activities  planned 
by  various  state  and  county  governments,  such  as  infrastructure  upgrades,  would  be 
implemented.  Failure  to  implement  these  upgrades  might  result  in  a  change  in  significance 
level.  Possible  mitigation  of  adverse  impacts  is  also  presented,  where  appropriate.  A  summary 
of  these  impacts  is  presented  in  Section  5.13. 

5.1  Land-Use  Impacts 

Sections  5.1.1  and  5.1.2  contain  information  regarding  land-use  impacts  associated  with 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Section  5.1.1  discusses  land-use 
impacts  at  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site.  Section  5.1.2  discusses  land-use  impacts  at 
offsite  areas,  especially  the  proposed  causeway  alignment. 

5.1.1  The  Site  and  Vicinity 

Onsite  land-use  impacts  from  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 
Of  the  430  ac  disturbed  in  building  a  new  plant  (excluding  the  proposed  causeway),  only  225 
ac  (27.5  percent  of  the  819-ac  PSEG  Site)  would  be  occupied  by  permanent  structures  and 
supporting  facilities  during  operations.  Of  this  225-ac  area,  70  ac  would  be  permanently

NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


disturbed  for  the  power  block  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Section  4.1  discusses  the  land-use 
impacts  of  this  permanent  land  disturbance. 

Onsite  land-use  impacts  associated  with  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  result 
primarily  from  the  deposition  of  solids  from  cooling  tower  operation  (impacts  of  the  heat 
dissipation  system,  including  deposition,  are  discussed  in  Section  5.3).  PSEG  has  stated  the 
cooling  towers  would  be  located  north  of  the  power  block  as  shown  in  Figure  2-2.  There  is  the 
potential  for  fogging,  icing,  salt  drift,  and  noise  to  occur  from  cooling  tower  operations 
(NRC  201 3-TN2654).  However,  a  review  of  the  cooling  tower  operations  presented  in  the 
PSEG  ESP  application  indicates  that  land  uses  would  not  be  noticeably  affected  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  Adjacent  land  uses  north,  west,  and  east  of  the  proposed  cooling  tower  location  are 
the  Artificial  Island  Confined  Disposal  Facility,  the  Delaware  River,  and  coastal  marsh, 
respectively.  There  are  no  residences,  farmland,  or  other  developed  land  uses  within  2.8  mi  of 
the  PSEG  Site,  so  only  minor  salt  deposition  impacts  to  land  uses  on  the  site  or  in  the  vicinity 
are  expected  (see  Section  5.3). 

As  discussed  in  Section  4.1.1,  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  be 
consistent  with  existing  land  uses  at  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  (HCGS)  and  Salem 
Generating  Station  (SGS)  and  with  current  land-use  zoning  (Industrial)  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek 
Township  (LACT  1999-TN2416).  Further,  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental 
Protection  (NJDEP)  Division  of  Land  Use  Regulation  has  determined  the  PSEG  ESP  application 
is  consistent  with  New  Jersey  Rules  on  Coastal  Zone  Management  (see  Section  2.2.1).  PSEG 
has  submitted  a  petition  to  the  State  of  New  Jersey  to  expand  the  existing  “Heavy  Industry- 
Transportation-Utility  Node”  on  Artificial  Island  to  include  the  location  of  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  (PSEG  2012-TN2282)  (see  Section  2.2.1). 

There  are  no  prime  farmlands  or  farmlands  of  unique  or  statewide  importance  on  the  PSEG 
Site,  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  site  would  not  affect  any  such  farmlands  in 
the  vicinity.  Likewise,  there  are  no  lands  under  Deeds  of  Conservation  Restriction  (DCRs)  or 
Wildlife  Management  Areas  (WMAs)  on  the  PSEG  Site,  and  operating  a  new  plant  on  the  site 
would  not  affect  any  of  the  lands  under  DCRs  or  lands  in  WMAs  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site. 

Any  indirect  offsite  land-use  changes  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  incidental  to  plant 
operations,  such  as  conversion  of  land  to  housing  for  operations  and  outage  workers,  are 
expected  to  be  minor.  The  analysis  of  housing  impacts  in  Section  5.4.4  finds  sufficient  vacant 
permanent  housing  is  available  to  accommodate  the  projected  demand  from  workers  who  would 
operate  a  new  plant.  Thus,  no  substantial  offsite  land-use  impacts  in  the  vicinity  are  expected 
due  to  project  employment  during  operations. 

Overall,  the  land-use  impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  would 
be  minor  and  would  neither  destabilize  nor  noticeably  alter  any  important  attributes  of  existing 
land  uses  on  the  site  or  in  the  vicinity.  Therefore,  based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG 
and  the  review  team’s  independent  review,  the  review  team  concludes  the  land-use  impacts  of 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL.

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


5.1.2  Offsite  Areas 

Offsite  land-use  impacts  from  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  are  expected  to  be  minimal 
and  primarily  associated  with  the  proposed  causeway.  Of  the  69.0  ac  disturbed  in  building  the 
causeway,  about  45.5  ac  would  be  permanently  affected  or  occupied  by  permanent  structures 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Section  4.1  discusses  the  land-use  impacts  of  this  permanent  land 
disturbance. 

Two  land-use-related  issues  associated  with  the  long-term  presence  of  the  causeway  would 
result  from  shading  caused  by  the  50-ft-wide  causeway  structure  and  its  piers  and  other  support 
structures  and  automobile  traffic  on  the  causeway.  The  impacts  of  shading  on  surface  water 
and  aquatic  resources  are  discussed  in  Sections  4.2  and  4.3,  and  the  impacts  of  automobile 
traffic  on  water  quality,  ecological  resources,  and  socioeconomic  resources  are  discussed  in 
Sections  4.3  through  4.5. 

Over  the  operating  life  of  a  new  plant,  periodic  maintenance  would  be  required  to  ensure  the 
causeway  is  in  safe  operational  condition,  including  storm  drainage  features.  PSEG  has  stated 
that  maintenance  activities  would  include  repair  and  maintenance  of  the  roadway  surface  and 
catch  basins/drainage,  lane  striping,  and  periodic  management,  mowing,  and  cutting  of  adjacent 
vegetation  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  land-use  impacts  of  these  maintenance  activities  are 
expected  to  be  minimal. 

As  discussed  in  Section  4.1.2,  the  section  of  the  proposed  causeway  from  the  PSEG  property 
north  to  Lower  Alloways  Creek  is  zoned  for  Industrial  Use  by  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township 
(LACT  1999-TN2416).  However,  the  section  of  the  causeway  from  Lower  Alloways  Creek  north 
to  Money  Island  Road  is  zoned  for  Conservation  by  Elsinboro  Township,  while  the  section  along 
Money  Island  Road  is  zoned  Rural  Residential  (Elsinboro  2007-TN2417).  Thus,  the  causeway 
would  be  consistent  with  current  zoning  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  but  inconsistent 
with  part  of  the  current  zoning  (i.e.,  Conservation)  in  Elsinboro  Township.  PSEG  could  request 
a  zoning  variance  from  Elsinboro  Township  to  operate  the  proposed  causeway  in  the  area 
zoned  for  Conservation. 

As  discussed  in  Sections  2.2.1  and  4.1.1,  the  NJDEP  Division  of  Land  Use  Regulation  has 
determined  the  PSEG  ESP  application,  including  the  proposed  causeway,  is  consistent  with 
New  Jersey’s  Rules  on  Coastal  Zone  Management.  Most  of  the  proposed  causeway  route 
(21 .0  ac  of  impact)  is  protected  under  DCRs  held  by  the  State  of  New  Jersey  (PSEG  2012- 
TN2282).  If  these  DCRs  are  released  for  the  causeway  to  be  built  (see  Section  4.1.2),  the 
causeway  would  not  have  any  adverse  impacts  on  offsite  land  uses  protected  under  a  DCR, 
including  those  in  the  Alloway  Creek  Watershed  Wetland  Restoration  (ACW)  Site  and  Abbotts 
Meadow  and  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMAs. 

Overall,  the  land-use  impacts  of  the  proposed  causeway  during  operations  at  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  would  be  minor  and  would  neither  destabilize  nor  noticeably  alter  any  important 
attributes  of  existing  offsite  land  uses.  Therefore,  based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG 
and  the  review  team’s  independent  review,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  offsite  land-use 
impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  SMALL.

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


5.2  Water-Related  Impacts 

This  section  discusses  water-related  impacts  to  the  surrounding  environment  from  operation  of 
a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  primary  water-related  impacts  would  be 
associated  with  the  cooling  water  system  for  a  new  plant.  Details  of  the  operational  modes  and 
cooling  water  systems  associated  with  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  can  be  found  in 
Section  3.2.2.  Secondary  water-related  impacts  would  be  associated  with  groundwater 
withdrawals  for  operating  a  new  plant. 

Managing  water  resources  requires  understanding  and  balancing  the  tradeoffs  among  various, 
often  conflicting,  objectives.  In  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site,  these  objectives  include 
navigation,  recreation,  visual  aesthetics,  and  a  variety  of  beneficial  consumptive  water  uses. 

The  responsibility  for  regulating  water  use  and  water  quality  is  delegated  to  NJDEP  and  the 
Delaware  River  Basin  Commission  (DRBC). 

Water-use  and  water-quality  impacts  involved  with  operating  a  nuclear  power  plant  are  similar  to 
the  impacts  associated  with  any  large  thermoelectric  power  generation  facility,  and  PSEG  must 
obtain  the  same  water-related  permits  and  certifications  as  these  other  facilities.  Permits  and 
certifications  needed  would  include  the  following: 

•  Clean  Water  Act  (CWA,  33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  Section  401  Certification.  This  water- 
quality  certification  would  be  issued  by  NJDEP  and  would  ensure  that  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  would  not  conflict  with  State  water-quality  management  programs.  This 
certification  must  be  obtained  before  the  NRC  could  issue  a  COL  to  PSEG. 

•  CWA  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  Section  402(p)  National  Pollutant  Discharge 
Elimination  System  (NPDES)  Discharge  Permit.  This  permit  would  be  issued  by  NJDEP  and 
would  regulate  limits  of  pollutants  in  liquid  discharges  to  surface  water  (point  source 
stormwater  and  wastewater)  and  construction  dewatering.  A  stormwater  pollution 
prevention  plan  (SWPPP)  would  be  required. 

•  CWA  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  Section  404  Permit.  This  permit  would  be  issued  by 
the  USACE  and  would  be  required  for  the  discharge  of  any  dredged  and/or  fill  material 
during  operations  into  waters  of  the  United  States. 

•  CWA  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  Section  316(a).  This  section  regulates  the  cooling 
water  discharges  to  protect  the  health  of  the  aquatic  environment.  The  scope  would  be 
covered  under  the  NPDES  permit  with  NJDEP. 

•  CWA  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  Section  316(b).  This  section  regulates  cooling  water 
intake  structures  to  minimize  environmental  impacts  associated  with  their  location,  design, 
construction,  and  capacity.  The  scope  would  be  covered  under  the  NPDES  permit  with 
NJDEP. 

•  Section  10  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors  Act  of  1899  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  -TN660)  Permit.  This 

permit  prohibits  obstruction  or  alteration  of  navigable  waters  of  the  United  States  and  would 
be  issued  by  the  USACE  for  dredging  activities  that  may  be  needed  during  operations. 

•  Federal  Coastal  Zone  Management  Act  of  1972  (16  USC  1451  et  seq.  -TN1243) 

Certification.  This  concurrence  of  consistency  with  the  State  coastal  program’s  policies 


NUREG-2168 


5-4

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


would  be  issued  by  NJDEP.  It  applies  to  any  activity  that  is  on  land,  in  water  or  in  any 
natural  resource,  or  any  activity  that  affects  land  use,  water  use,  or  any  natural  resource  in 
the  coastal  zone,  if  the  activity  requires  a  Federal  license  or  permit. 

•  Delaware  River  Basin  Compact,  Section  3.8,  Resolution  No.  71-4  (DRBC  Res71-4-TN4296). 

PSEG  would  comply  with  the  DRBC  agreements  on  surface-water  withdrawal  from  the 
Delaware  River  (for  cooling)  and  groundwater  withdrawals  from  the  aquifer. 

•  New  Jersey  Water  Supply  Management  Act  (NJSA  58:1A-a  et  seq.  -TN4295).  Permits 
under  this  Act  would  be  issued  by  NJDEP  to  regulate  dewatering,  well  drilling,  and 
groundwater  use. 

PSEG  would  also  comply  with  other  applicable  regional,  state,  and  local  regulations  as 
described  in  its  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Section  5.2.1  discusses  the  hydrologic  alterations  in  surface  water  and  groundwater  related  to 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Water-use  impacts  from  operations 
are  discussed  in  Sections  5.2.2. 1  and  5.22.2  for  surface  water  and  groundwater,  respectively. 
Water-quality  impacts  from  operations  are  discussed  in  Sections  5.2.3. 1  and  5. 2. 3. 2  for  surface 
water  and  groundwater,  respectively.  Water  monitoring  during  plant  operation  is  discussed  in 
Section  5.2.4.  The  combined  impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
along  with  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS,  as  well  as  other  activities  in  the  surrounding 
environment,  are  discussed  in  Chapter  7  (Cumulative  Impacts). 

5.2.1  Hydrological  Alterations 

This  section  discusses  the  hydrological  alterations  and  the  resulting  effects  from  operation  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  As  stated  in  Section  4.2.1,  site  hydrological 
alterations  during  construction  and  preconstruction  would  include  a  change  to  the  local 
landscape  and  drainage  patterns,  which  could  cause  increased  runoff  or  erosion.  Hydrological 
alterations  to  the  Delaware  River  from  operations  would  include  increased  water  withdrawal, 
discharge  of  cooling  water  blowdown  and  wastewater,  and  maintenance  dredging  of  the  intake 
canal. 

During  construction  and  preconstruction,  the  power  block  for  a  new  plant  would  be  placed  on  an 
elevated  area,  with  drainage  directed  away  from  the  facilities.  Modifications  to  the  land  surface 
made  during  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  would  alter  the  local  hydrology,  and 
these  alterations  would  remain  during  plant  operations.  A  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be 
located  north  of  the  existing  HCGS  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Stormwater  runoff  from  the  PSEG 
Site  would  drain  primarily  to  the  Delaware  River.  A  detailed  design  of  retention  and  holding 
areas  has  not  been  determined,  but  an  SWPPP  would  be  in  place  to  manage  stormwater  runoff 
and  prevent  erosion.  An  SWPPP  would  be  required  to  meet  New  Jersey  Pollutant  Discharge 
Elimination  System  (NJPDES)  stormwater  discharge  requirements  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
Because  of  the  relatively  small  area  that  could  generate  increased  runoff  compared  to  the 
drainage  area  of  the  Delaware  River  near  the  PSEG  Site,  the  increased  runoff  is  not  expected 
to  noticeably  affect  the  hydrologic  conditions  in  the  Delaware  River  near  the  PSEG  Site. 
Because  best  management  practices  (BMPs)  would  be  used  as  required  by  NJPDES  under  the 
SWPPP,  and  because  the  additional  runoff-generating  area  is  small  compared  to  the  drainage

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


area  of  the  Delaware  River  near  the  PSEG  Site,  the  surface-water  quality  of  the  river  would  be 
minimally  affected  by  the  land  surface  modifications  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Land  surface  modification  would  also  alter  groundwater  infiltration  areas  because  of  the 
increased  amount  of  impervious  surface  at  the  PSEG  Site,  regrading  of  the  site,  and  the  filling  of 
some  onsite  water  bodies.  These  alterations  could  impact  groundwater  flow  in  the  alluvium  and 
Vincentown  aquifers  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site,  but  the  effects  are  expected  to  be  localized  to  the 
site.  Also,  the  alluvium  and  Vincentown  aquifers  are  not  used  locally  as  sources  of  potable 
water,  and  low-permeability  units  separate  them  from  the  deeper  aquifers  that  supply  potable 
water.  Therefore,  it  is  likely  that  water  supply  and  quality  in  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer 
and  the  Potomac-Raritan-Magothy  (PRM)  aquifer  system  would  be  unaffected  by  the 
hydrological  alterations  resulting  from  land  surface  modifications  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

As  described  in  Chapter  3,  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  withdraw  water 
from  the  Delaware  River  for  the  circulating  water,  service  water,  and  ultimate  heat  sink  (UHS) 
systems.  The  primary  hydrologic  alteration  from  this  water  use  would  be  the  reduction  of  flow  in 
the  Delaware  River,  which  could  affect  both  the  availability  of  water  for  other  uses  and  the 
salinity  of  the  upstream  reach  of  the  river.  In  addition,  the  intake  canal  would  require  periodic 
dredging.  The  impacts  from  consumptive  water  use  by  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  are 
evaluated  in  terms  of  the  estimated  reduction  in  Delaware  River  flow  in  absolute  and  relative 
terms  for  normal  and  maximum  operational  uses  and  for  long-term  average  flows  and  low  flows 
in  the  river.  These  impacts  are  discussed  in  Sections  5.2.2  and  5.2.3. 

Plant  blowdown  and  wastewater  would  be  discharged  to  the  Delaware  River,  with  potential 
effects  on  the  thermal  characteristics  of  the  river  and  on  water  quality.  The  impacts  of  plant 
discharges  to  the  Delaware  River  are  evaluated  in  Section  5.2.3. 

As  described  in  Chapter  3,  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  withdraw  water  from  the  PRM 
aquifer  system  for  those  plant  systems  requiring  fresh  water.  The  effect  of  this  groundwater  use 
would  be  a  reduction  in  the  hydraulic  head  in  the  confined  aquifer  around  the  pumping  wells. 

With  a  sufficient  reduction  in  head,  the  pumping  could  cause  salt  water  intrusion  in  the  aquifer. 
These  impacts  are  evaluated  in  terms  of  the  magnitude  and  extent  of  the  anticipated  reduction 
in  hydraulic  head  in  Sections  5.2.2  and  5.2.3. 

In  summary,  the  hydrological  alterations  applicable  to  operations  would  be  primarily  from  the 
intake  of  Delaware  River  water,  the  discharge  of  blowdown  water  and  associated  waste  streams 
to  the  river,  altered  drainage  patterns  from  landscape  changes,  withdrawal  of  groundwater  from 
the  PRM  aquifer  system,  and  periodic  dredging  of  the  intake  canal. 

5.2.2  Water-Use  Impacts 

This  section  describes  the  potential  impacts  on  surface-water  and  groundwater  uses  and  users 
resulting  from  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Information  presented 
in  PSEG’s  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  other  information  obtained  by  the  review  team,  and 
independent  analyses  performed  by  the  review  team  were  used  to  assess  the  impacts.

5. 2. 2. 7  Surface-  Water-  Use  Impacts 

A  major  concern  of  the  DRBC  is  preventing  salt  water  intrusion  in  the  upstream  regions  of  the 
Delaware  River  during  a  drought.  As  stated  in  Section  2. 3. 2.1,  instream  flow  objectives  are  in 
place  for  the  Delaware  River  to  maintain  the  salt  line  at  Delaware  River  Mile  (RM)  98, 
downstream  of  public  water  supply  intakes  on  the  river.  Salt  line  in  the  tidal  Delaware  River  is 
defined  as  the  location  where  the  7-day  average  chloride  concentration  equals  250  ppm 
(DRBC  2008-TN2277).  Several  programs  are  in  place  to  ensure  sufficient  freshwater  is 
available  to  prevent  upstream  salt  intrusion  from  occurring.  These  programs  involve  reservoirs 
that  can  be  used  to  release  water  to  the  river  during  a  drought.  PSEG  has  an  allocation  of 
6,695  ac-ft  of  storage  in  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  to  offset  the  consumptive  uses  of  its  existing 
power  plants  in  the  region  (HCGS,  SGS,  and  Mercer  Generating  Stations  1  and  2)  during  a 
drought  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  As  stated  in  Section  2.3.1. 1,  the  total  storage  in  the  Merrill 
Creek  reservoir  is  46,000  ac-ft.  The  DRBC  requires  releases  from  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir 
when  the  DRBC  drought  management  plan  causes  the  flow  objective  at  Trenton  to  fall  below 
3,000  cfs  and  the  equivalent  flow  at  Trenton  falls  below  3,000  cfs  for  two  consecutive  days 
(MCOG  2003-TN3312).  A  minimum  release  of  3  cfs  from  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  is  required  at 
all  times.  In  the  past,  releases  from  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  have  occurred  on  four  occasions 
(PSEG  2012-TN3313): 

•  41  days  between  September  13,  1991,  and  November  22,  1991,  with  a  total  release  of 
2,001,752,000  gallons  (6,143  ac-ft)  of  water; 

•  1 1  days  between  September  1 6,  1 995,  and  November  1 ,  1 995,  with  a  total  release  of 
502,988,000  gallons  (1,544  ac-ft)  of  water; 

•  16  days  between  December  15,  1998,  and  February  3,  1999,  with  a  total  release  of 
666,363,000  gallons  (2,045  ac-ft)  of  water;  and 

•  37  days  between  October  29,  2001 ,  and  January  25,  2002,  with  a  total  release  of 
1 ,658,472,000  gallons  (5,090  ac-ft)  of  water. 

After  these  periods  of  release,  the  reservoir  was  filled  by  pumping  water  over  periods  of  26,  11, 
27,  and  46  days,  respectively.  The  filling  periods  occurred  one  to  several  months  after  stopping 
the  previous  releases  (PSEG  2012-TN3313). 

The  average  consumptive  water  use  from  the  Delaware  River  for  operation  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  26,420  gpm  (58.9  cfs)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Water 
withdrawn  from  the  Delaware  River  is  brackish  with  up  to  18  ppt  salinity  and,  therefore,  is  not  fit 
for  potable  use.  The  DRBC  applies  an  equivalent  impact  factor  of  0.18  to  account  for  the 
difference  between  the  river  water  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  freshwater.  This  makes  the  water 
consumption  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  equivalent  to  a  freshwater 
consumption  of  4,756  gpm  (10.6  cfs).  This  equivalent  freshwater  consumptive  use  is  0.1  percent 
of  the  mean  annual  flow  at  Trenton,  New  Jersey,  during  the  historic  low  water  period  of  1961  — 
1967  (7,888  cfs),  and  0.7  percent  of  the  minimum  monthly  flow  (1,548  cfs,  recorded  in  July 
1965).  The  total  consumptive  losses  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  would  be  less  than  0.01  percent  of  the  tidal  flows  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

PSEG  has  not  selected  a  reactor  technology  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
One  reactor  technology  used  in  the  ESP  plant  parameter  envelope  (PPE)  approach,  the

Advanced  Passive  1000  (API  000),  may  require  surface-water  withdrawals  from  the  Delaware 
River  that  would  cause  the  currently  permitted  PSEG  allocation  of  6,695  ac-ft  in  the  Merrill 
Creek  reservoir  to  fall  short  by  465  ac-ft  or  6.9  percent  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  When  PSEG 
selects  a  reactor  technology,  PSEG  would  (1)  revise  the  consumptive  water  use  allocations  of 
other  plants  it  owns  and  supports  through  its  storage  allocation  in  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  or 
(2)  acquire  additional  storage  from  the  existing  rights  of  other  Merrill  Creek  co-owners  to  support 
NJDEP  permitting  and  DRBC  docketing  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
The  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  storage  capacity  of  46,000  ac-ft  far  exceeds  that  needed  to  meet  the 
additional  465  ac-ft  allocation  required  for  the  API  000.  In  addition,  the  DRBC  allows  for 
temporary  acquisition  of  releases  from  other  owners  of  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  storage 
(MCOG  2003-TN3312).  For  these  reasons,  the  review  team  determined  that  additional  surface- 
water  use  for  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  could  be  met  without  a  noticeable  impact 
to  the  instream  flow  targets  in  the  Delaware  River.  Because  the  consumptive  water  use  would 
be  a  small  percentage  of  the  river  flow,  even  under  drought  conditions,  and  it  is  reasonably 
foreseeable  that  there  would  be  sufficient  water  in  the  Merrill  Creek  Reservoir  to  offset  a  new 
plant’s  consumptive  use,  the  review  team  has  determined  that  the  impact  of  consumptive  use  of 
surface  water  by  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL. 

5. 2. 2. 2  Groundwater-Use  Impacts 

Groundwater  would  be  used  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  for  the  potable  and  sanitary  water 
system  (PSWS),  the  fire  protection  system  (FPS),  the  demineralized  water  distribution  system 
(DWDS),  and  other  minor  uses.  The  average  withdrawal  rate  for  operations  would  be  210  gpm, 
primarily  for  the  PSWS  and  DWDS,  with  a  maximum  withdrawal  rate  of  953  gpm,  two-thirds  of 
which  is  accounted  for  by  the  FPS  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Maximum  rates  would  be  temporary 
because  they  would  occur  only  during  abnormal  conditions.  Two  additional  wells  would  be 
installed  in  the  PRM  aquifers  to  supply  groundwater  for  a  new  plant  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

By  lowering  hydraulic  heads  in  the  PRM  aquifers,  groundwater  pumping  to  support  operation 
of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  could  impact  other  groundwater  users. 

The  nearest  public  supply  wells  that  withdraw  from  the  PRM  aquifer  system  are  located 
approximately  3  mi  across  the  Delaware  River  in  Delaware  and  over  5  mi  to  the  northeast  in 
Salem,  New  Jersey.  The  nearest  private  residences  are  located  approximately  2.8  mi  east  of 
the  site.  To  evaluate  the  potential  impact  on  these  groundwater  users,  the  review  team 
estimated  the  reduction  (drawdown)  in  groundwater  head  that  could  result  from  the  operational 
pumping  of  210  gpm  from  the  middle  PRM  aquifer. 

To  estimate  the  drawdown  at  offsite  locations,  the  review  team  completed  an  independent 
evaluation  using  an  analytical  solution  for  radial  flow  to  a  well  in  a  confined  aquifer  (the  Theis 
solution,  e.g.,  Freeze  and  Cherry  1979-TN3275).  The  review  team  expects  the  analytical 
solution  to  be  bounding  for  locations  offsite  (e.g.,  the  closest  groundwater  users)  because 
leakage  from  the  overlying/underlying  aquitard  units  would  tend  to  reduce  the  drawdown. 
Hydraulic  parameters  of  the  middle  PRM  aquifer  were  taken  from  a  modeling  study  at  the  site 
that  was  conducted  to  evaluate  potential  aquifer  responses  to  changes  in  groundwater 
withdrawal  rates  for  HCGS/SGS  operation  (Dames  and  Moore  1988-TN331 1 ). 

Dames  and  Moore  (1988-TN331 1 )  selected  parameter  values  to  match  groundwater  heads  and 
chloride  concentrations  measured  in  site  wells  in  1987.  The  transmissivity  value  used  in  the 


NUREG-2168 


5-8 


November  2015 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


analytical  solution  represents  a  central  value  from  the  Dames  and  Moore  model  (1,485  ft/d,  or 
11,110  gpd/ft)  and  is  within  the  range  of  values  presented  in  ER  Table  2.3-9  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  The  storage  coefficient  value  used  in  the  analytical  solution  matches  the  value  used 
by  the  Dames  and  Moore  model  (0.00009).  Use  of  a  larger  storage  coefficient  value,  such  as 
the  value  presented  in  ER  Table  2.3-9  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  would  decrease  the  estimated 
drawdown. 

The  analytical  solution  was  evaluated  for  use  at  the  PSEG  Site  by  comparing  it  to  model  results 
presented  in  Dames  and  Moore  (1 988-TN331 1 ):  20  years  of  pumping  at  1 987  rates  (493  gpm 
from  the  middle  PRM  aquifer).  The  analytical  solution  provided  a  reasonable  approximation,  as 
shown  on  the  left  side  of  Figure  5-1 .  The  analytical  solution  overestimated  drawdown  near  the 
pumping  well  because  all  pumping  was  concentrated  at  a  single  well  instead  of  distributing  it 
among  three  wells  as  is  the  actual  case.  The  analytical  solution  slightly  underestimated  the 
drawdown  at  4,500  ft.

Dames  and  Moore  (1988-TN331 1);  (right)  estimated  drawdown  from  40 years  of 
continuously  pumping  210  gpm  from  the  middle  PRM  aquifer. 

The  analytical  solution  was  applied  to  estimate  drawdown  after  40  years  of  continuous  pumping 
at  210  gpm.  The  resulting  drawdown  is  shown  on  the  right  side  of  Figure  5-1  as  a  function  of 
the  distance  from  the  pumping  well.  The  drawdown  is  16.6  ft  at  a  distance  of  3  mi  and  14.4  ft  at 
a  distance  of  5  mi.  According  to  U.S.  Geological  Survey  interpretations  of  regional  groundwater 
levels  (Lacombe  and  Rosman  2001-TN4194;  Lacombe  and  Rosman  1997-TN4195;  Rosman  et 
al.  1995-TN4196;  Eckel  and  Walker  1986-TN4197;  Walker  1983-TN4198),  existing  groundwater 
heads  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer  are  estimated  to  be  at  an  elevation  of  about  -40  ft  at  a 
distance  of  about  3  mi  from  the  PSEG  Site  as  a  result  of  past  and  current  HCGS  and  SGS 
groundwater  use.  An  additional  14-17  ft  of  drawdown  from  groundwater  use  by  the  proposed 
plant  would  pose  no  risk  of  dewatering  an  offsite  well  screened  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer. 
Because  of  leakage  from  the  overlying  and  underlying  aquitard  units,  actual  drawdown  is

expected  to  be  less  than  predicted  by  the  analytical  solution.  As  a  result,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  the  impact  on  nearby  groundwater  users  from  the  operational  use  of 
groundwater  by  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL,  and  no  further 
mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

5.2.3  Water-Quality  Impacts 

This  section  discusses  impacts  to  the  quality  of  water  resources  from  the  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Surface-water  impacts  would  include  those  from 
discharges  of  thermal,  chemical,  and  radiological  wastes  as  well  as  physical  changes  in  the 
Delaware  River  resulting  from  effluents  discharged  by  a  new  plant.  Groundwater  impacts  would 
include  those  from  inadvertent  chemical  spills  that  may  affect  shallow  (brackish)  groundwater 
and  pumping-induced  salinity  increases  to  deep  aquifers. 

5. 2. 3. 7  Surface-  Water-  Quality  Impacts 

Stormwater  Runoff 

During  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  stormwater  runoff  from  the  newly  developed 
areas  of  the  PSEG  Site  could  increase.  However,  as  stated  in  Section  5.2.1,  an  SWPPP  would 
be  in  place  to  manage  stormwater  runoff  and  prevent  erosion.  The  SWPPP  would  be  required 
to  meet  NJPDES  stormwater  discharge  requirements.  PSEG  would  use  BMPs  as  required  by 
N  JPDES  under  the  SWPPP  to  minimize  degradation  of  runoff  water  quality.  Because  of  the 
relatively  small  area  that  could  generate  increased  runoff  compared  to  the  drainage  area  of  the 
Delaware  River  and  the  use  of  BMPs,  the  increased  runoff  and  its  quality  are  not  expected  to 
noticeably  affect  Delaware  River  water  quality  near  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  the  review  team 
concluded  that  the  surface-water  quality  of  the  river  would  be  minimally  affected  by  stormwater 
runoff  during  operations. 

Thermal  Discharge 

During  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  blowdown  from  the  cooling 
water  system  cooling  towers  would  be  discharged  to  the  Delaware  River  using  a  discharge 
pipeline.  Thermal  discharges  are  allowed  and  regulated  as  part  of  the  NJPDES  permit 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  DRBC’s  Administrative  Manual  Part  III,  which  sets  water-quality 
requirements,  applies  to  all  public  and  private  waste  discharges  to  waters  to  the  Delaware  River 
Basin  (18  CFR  Part  410-TN3235).  Water-quality  standards  for  the  Delaware  River  Basin  are 
listed  in  Article  3  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  Water  Code,  and  water-quality  standards  for 
interstate  tidal  streams  are  listed  in  Section  3.30  of  Article  3  (DRBC  201 1-TN2371 ).  Zone  5  of 
the  interstate  tidal  streams  is  the  part  of  the  Delaware  River  between  Delaware 
RM  78.8  and  48.2;  the  discharge  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  occur 
in  this  zone.  Stream  water  quality  objectives  for  Zone  5  are  listed  in  Water  Code  Article  3 
Section  3.30.5.  The  temperature-related  standards  for  Zone  5  require  that  the  ambient  water 
temperature  in  the  river  outside  the  designated  heat  dissipation  area  (HDA)  may  not  increase  by 
more  than  4°F  (2.2°C)  from  September  through  May,  and  by  1 ,5°F  (0.8°C)  from  June  through 
August,  with  a  year-round  maximum  water  temperature  of  86°F  (30°C).  The  DRBC  defines  an 
HDA  for  thermal  discharges;  these  are  determined  on  a  case-by-case  basis  and  are  an  area

within  which  thermal  limits  set  by  the  DRBC  may  be  exceeded  (DRBC  201 1-TN2371 ).  The 
HDA  for  SGS  has  been  in  effect  since  1977.  The  HDA  for  SGS  was  modified  by  DRBC  in  1995 
and  2001,  with  the  2001  requirements  stated  in  the  2001  NJPDES  permit  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ). 

SGS  has  seasonal  HDAs.  From  June  through  August,  the  SGS  HDA  extends  25.300  ft 
upstream  and  21,100  ft  downstream  from  the  SGS  discharge,  with  its  lateral  extent  into  the  river 
reaching  no  closer  than  1 ,320  ft  from  the  eastern  edge  of  the  Delaware  River  shipping  channel 
(NRC  201 1-TN3131).  From  September  through  May,  the  SGS  HDA  extends  3,300  ft  upstream 
and  6,000  ft  downstream  from  the  discharge,  with  its  lateral  extent  into  the  river  reaching  no 
closer  than  3,200  ft  from  the  eastern  edge  of  the  Delaware  River  shipping  channel  (NRC  2011- 
TN3131).  PSEG  also  has  held  a  thermal  variance  for  SGS  under  Section  316(a)  since  the  1994 
NJPDES  permit.  In  2006.  PSEG  applied  for  the  NJPDES  permit  renewal  with  a  request  for 
renewal  of  the  31 6(a)  variance.  PSEG  submitted  a  timely  application  for  renewal  of  the 
NJPDES  permit;  therefore,  the  conditions  of  its  expired  permit  remain  in  effect  pursuant  to  New 
Jersey  Administrative  Code  (NJAC)  7:14A2.8  (TN4297).  The  30-day  average  SGS  circulating 
water  flow  for  its  once-through  cooling  system  is  about  3,024  million  gpd  or  4,679  cfs. 

The  HCGS  HDA  is  a  rectangle  extending  2,500  ft  upstream.  2,500  ft  downstream,  and  1,500  ft 
into  the  river  from  the  HCGS  blowdown  discharge  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  HCGS  blowdown 
discharge  is  located  approximately  4,000  ft  upstream  of  the  SGS  discharge.  The  blowdown 
discharge  pipe  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  located  approximately  100  ft  offshore  in 
the  river  and  approximately  2,500  ft  north  of  the  HCGS  discharge  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The 
discharge  pipe  outlet  for  a  new  plant  would  be  located  approximately  3.0  ft  above  the  river 
bottom,  and  the  average  discharge  and  velocity  would  be  approximately  51,946  gpm  or  116  cfs 
and  9.2  fps,  respectively  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Because  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  would  have  an  average  discharge  to  the  Delaware  River  about  60  percent  greater 
than  that  of  the  HCGS  discharge,  the  HDA  for  a  new  plant  is  expected  to  be  larger  than,  and 
overlap  with,  the  HCGS  HDA. 

To  determine  the  effects  of  discharge  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  Delaware  River, 
PSEG  used  the  Cornell  Mixing  Zone  Expert  System  (CORMIX)  to  perform  a  conservative 
analysis  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG  used  the  CORMIX  model  that  was  developed  to  support 
the  recent  HCGS  extended  power  uprate  application  as  the  starting  point  (PSEG  2012- 
TN2244).  During  the  thermal  plume  analysis  to  support  the  HCGS  power  uprate  application, 
PSEG  determined  that  June  was  the  critical  month  for  meeting  regulatory  criteria  for 
temperature  in  the  Delaware  River.  For  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  PSEG  evaluated  five 
discharge  thermal  plume  scenarios:  (1 )  during  ebb  tide  after  slack  water;  (2)  during  ebb  tide, 
running  tide;  (3)  during  low  water,  running  tide;  (4)  during  flood  tide  after  slack  water;  and 
(5)  during  flood  tide,  running  tide.  No  heat  loss  to  the  atmosphere  was  assumed,  which 
maximizes  water  temperature  in  the  plume.  The  discharge  from  a  new  plant  was  set  to  1 1 6  cfs. 
The  discharge  excess  temperature  was  set  to  17.3°F,  which  is  the  10  percent  exceedance 
excess  temperature  for  the  HCGS  discharge.  PSEG  assumed  discharge  from  a  new  plant 
would  be  similar  in  thermal  characteristics  to  discharge  from  HCGS  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 
Similarly,  PSEG  selected  the  excess  salinity  of  the  discharge  from  a  new  plant  as  0.81  kg/m3, 
which  is  more  than  the  10  percent  exceedance  excess  salinity  (0.61  kg/m3)  but  less  than  the 
5  percent  exceedance  excess  salinity  (0.88  kg/m3)  of  the  HCGS  discharge.  PSEG  used  the 
ambient  discharge  velocities  and  water  levels  in  the  Delaware  River  using  a  June  2008  Acoustic

Doppler  Current  Profiler  measurement  at  Reedy  Point  station  (PSEG  2012-TN2244).  The 
review  team  evaluated  the  CORMIX  simulation  input  parameters  selected  by  PSEG  for  the 
thermal  effects  assessment  and  determined  the  following  combination  would  result  in  a  thermal 
plume  that  would  be  larger  and  would  have  higher  water  temperature  than  typical  average 
conditions: 

•  1 0  percent  exceedance  excess  temperature  of  the  discharge, 

•  greater  than  10  percent  exceedance  excess  salinity  of  the  discharge,  and 

•  no  heat  exchange  with  the  atmosphere. 

Therefore,  the  review  team  concluded  that  the  thermal  effects  determined  by  PSEG  for  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  are  conservative. 

In  the  two  CORMIX  scenarios  run  during  slack  tide  (scenarios  1  and  4),  the  plume  extends 
directly  into  the  Delaware  River  away  from  the  discharge  point  because  the  tidal  velocities  are 
small.  For  scenarios  1  and  4,  the  CORMIX  results  showed  that  the  distances  along  the  plume 
centerline  where  the  excess  temperatures  would  fall  to  1 ,5°F  were  492  and  656  ft  from  the 
discharge,  respectively  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  lateral  extent  of  the  plume  transverse  to 
ambient  flow  was  427  ft  for  scenario  1  and  466  ft  for  scenario  4  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  In  the 
other  three  CORMIX  scenarios,  the  plume  is  quickly  turned  in  the  direction  of  the  advancing 
tide.  The  farthest  downstream  extent  of  the  plume  during  ebb  tide  before  the  temperature 
excess  falls  to  1 .5°F  was  443  ft  for  CORMIX  scenario  2,  and  the  farthest  upstream  extent  of  the 
plume  during  flood  tide  before  the  temperature  excess  falls  to  1 .5°F  was  295  ft  for  CORMIX 
scenario  5.  The  lateral  extent  of  the  plume  transverse  to  ambient  flow  was  450  from  the  point  of 
discharge  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Based  on  the  CORMIX  simulations,  the  thermal  plume  of  the  discharge  from  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  (defined  by  the  1.5°F  temperature  excess)  would  have  a  maximum  extent  of  about 
700  ft  into  the  river  from  the  discharge  location,  about  300  ft  upstream  from  the  discharge,  and 
about  500  ft  downstream  from  the  discharge.  This  plume  extent  is  smaller  than  the  HCGS  HDA 
and  would  partially  overlap  the  HCGS  HDA  during  slack  and  ebb  tides.  Because  the  new  plant 
discharge  would  be  larger  than  the  discharge  from  HCGS  and  the  distance  between  the  two 
discharge  locations  (about  2,500  ft)  is  much  larger  than  the  maximum  extent  of  the  new  plant’s 
thermal  plume,  the  review  team  determined  that  the  actual  overlap  of  the  thermal  plumes  from 
the  new  plant  and  HCGS  would  be  minor. 

The  extent  of  the  thermal  plume  from  the  new  plant  would  be  much  smaller  than  the  SGS  HDA 
and  would  be  completely  contained  within  the  existing  SGS  HDA.  Because  the  extent  of  the 
thermal  plume  from  a  new  plant  would  be  small  relative  to  the  approved  HDA  for  SGS,  and 
because  the  extent  of  its  largest  excess  temperatures  would  be  localized  near  the  discharge 
outlet  far  from  the  areas  of  large  excess  temperatures  at  SGS,  the  review  team  determined  the 
impacts  of  thermal  discharges  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  minor. 

Figure  5-2  illustrates  the  relationship  among  the  CORMIX-predicted  thermal  plume  from  the  new 
plant’s  discharge  during  flood  tide  (with  the  plume  size  defined  by  the  1.5°F  temperature 
excess),  the  HCGS  HDA,  and  the  approximate  thermal  plume  from  the  SGS  discharge  based 
on  surface  temperature  measurements  at  the  end  of  flood  tide  on  May  29,  1998.  PSEG 
reported  that  during  flood  tides,  the  excess  temperature  near  the  discharge  location  of  a  new

nuclear  power  plant  from  both  SGS  units  operating  at  full  capacity  is  about  3.6°F  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  The  HCGS  HDA  extends  2,500  ft  north  of  the  HCGS  discharge  point,  approximately 
where  a  new  nuclear  power  plant’s  discharge  point  would  be  located.  Therefore,  it  is  possible 
that  the  water  temperature  in  the  Delaware  River  could  rise  above  86°F  in  a  small  area  just 
outside  the  HCGS  HDA.  This  area  is  just  outside  the  location  where  the  excess  temperature 
from  discharge  from  a  new  plant  would  reach  1 ,5°F  when  the  ambient  Delaware  River 
temperature  is  at  or  above  79.4°F.  The  excess  temperatures  from  operations  of  the  SGS, 
HCGS,  and  a  new  plant  would  be  3.6°F,  1.5°F,  and  1.5°F,  respectively  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Based  on  analysis  of  statistics  of  water  temperature  data  measured  at  the  U.S.  Geological 
Survey  (USGS)  station  Delaware  River  at  Reedy  Island  Jetty,  Delaware,  the  review  team 
determined  that  median  water  temperature  exceeds  79.4°F  from  July  14  through  August  20. 
Therefore,  the  review  team  concluded  that  in  the  area  just  outside  the  HCGS  HDA  and  just 
outside  the  area  where  the  excess  temperature  from  the  discharge  for  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  would  reach  1 ,5°F,  water  temperature  in  the  Delaware  River  could  frequently  (more  than 
half  of  the  days)  exceed  86°F  when  all  units  of  SGS,  HCGS,  and  a  new  plant  are  operating. 
However,  as  shown  by  the  PSEG  CORMIX  modeling,  the  thermal  plume  quickly  mixes  and 
dissipates  in  the  river  such  that  the  plume  areas  are  small.  Also,  while  reviewing  the  NJDEP 
application  for  a  new  discharge  to  the  Delaware  River,  DRBC  and  NJDEP  would  have  the 
opportunity  to  designate  an  HDA  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  require  discharge  rules  that 
would  protect  the  aquatic  environment.  Therefore,  the  review  team  determined  that  the 
combined  discharges  from  SGS,  HCGS,  and  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  not  noticeably 
affect  the  Delaware  River. 

Nonradioactive  Liquid  Effluent  Discharge 

Nonradioactive  liquid  effluents  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  discharged  to  the 
Delaware  River  with  the  cooling  water  system  blowdown.  However,  releases  to  the  tidal  marsh 
areas  north  of  the  PSEG  Site  are  not  anticipated.  The  effluents  to  be  released  include 
stormwater  drainage  and  treated  power  block  discharges  such  as  oily  wastes,  acid/caustic 
wastes,  operational  wastes,  blowdown,  and  sanitary  wastes  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Potable 
and  sanitary  discharges  are  regulated  under  the  Clean  Water  Act  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  - 
TN662)  through  the  NJPDES  permit  and  the  requirements  of  DRBC.  Chemical  treatment  in  the 
cooling  water  system  would  include  biocides  and  other  chemicals  (corrosion  inhibitors)  to 
maintain  water  quality.  All  effluents  would  be  controlled  in  accordance  with  appropriate  permits 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  concentrations  of  pollutants  in  the  liquid  discharge  would  be  set  by 
NJDEP  in  the  NJPDES  permit  for  a  new  plant.  Once  discharged  to  the  Delaware  River,  liquid 
wastes  would  quickly  mix  in  the  ambient  flow  and  become  diluted.  The  review  team  determined 
that  discharge  of  nonradioactive  liquid  effluents  to  the  Delaware  River  would  not  cause  a 
noticeable  impact  on  the  water  quality  of  the  river.  Therefore,  water-quality  impacts  from 
nonradioactive  waste  discharge  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  minor,  and  no 
additional  mitigation  is  needed  beyond  that  specified  in  appropriate  permits. 

Physical  Effects  of  Discharge 

Discharge  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  have  a  relatively  high  velocity  of  9.2  fps 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  To  minimize  potential  scour,  the  river  bottom  near  the  outlet  of  the 


NUREG-2168 


5-14

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


discharge  pipe  would  be  armored  with  riprap  or  other  engineered  features.  Therefore,  the 
review  team  concluded  that  physical  effects  of  wastewater  discharge  during  operation  of  a  new 
plant  would  be  minimal. 

Also,  infrequent  dredging  of  the  intake  channel  and  the  barge  canal  area  may  be  needed  during 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  These  activities  would  be  infrequent, 
and  any  sediment  disturbed  would  quickly  settle  upon  cessation  of  the  activities.  Any  effects  to 
water  quality  during  these  periods  would  be  temporary  and  would  be  managed  using  BMPs. 
Therefore,  the  review  team  concluded  that  physical  effects  of  dredging  during  operation  of  a 
new  plant  would  be  minimal. 

Surface-Water-Quality  Impacts  Summary 

The  review  team  determined  that  the  impacts  of  operations  activities  on  the  quality  of  surface 
water  in  the  area  would  be  limited  because  (1 )  the  volume  of  stormwater  runoff  from  the  site 
would  be  small  compared  to  the  volume  of  the  Delaware  River,  and  BMPs  would  be  used; 

(2)  the  thermal  plume  for  the  proposed  plant  would  be  completely  contained  within  the  existing 
SGS  HDA;  (3)  DRBC  and  NJDEP  would  designate  an  HDA  for  the  proposed  plant  and  require 
discharge  rules  that  would  protect  the  aquatic  environment;  (4)  nonradioactive  liquid  effluent 
concentrations  would  meet  NJDEP  permit  requirements;  (5)  the  river  bottom  near  the  outlet  of 
the  discharge  pipe  would  be  armored  with  riprap  or  other  engineered  features;  and  (6)  dredging 
of  the  intake  would  be  infrequent  and  any  disturbed  sediment  would  quickly  settle.  Therefore, 
the  review  team  determined  that  impacts  on  water  quality  in  the  Delaware  River  from  operations 
of  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL. 

5. 2. 3. 2  Groundwater-  Quality  Impacts 

PSEG  does  not  plan  routine  discharges  to  groundwater  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Potential  impacts  to  groundwater  could  come  from 
nonroutine  chemical  spills  that  may  migrate  to  shallow  water  (brackish)  zones.  BMPs  would  be 
used  during  operations  to  minimize  potential  impacts  of  chemical  spills  on  groundwater  quality. 

If  a  spill  occurs,  NJDEP  requires  reporting  and  remediation  to  minimize  or  prevent  groundwater 
impacts.  The  site  grade  would  contain  engineered  fill  with  a  low  permeability  to  further  limit  the 
risk  of  groundwater  contamination  from  accidental  releases  to  the  land  surface  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  An  additional  factor  limiting  the  impact  of  any  spills  to  shallow  groundwater  is  the  lack 
of  use  of  these  aquifers  because  of  their  brackish  water. 

By  reducing  groundwater  head  in  the  region  surrounding  the  PSEG  Site,  operational  use  of 
water  from  the  PRM  aquifers  has  the  potential  to  induce  saltwater  intrusion.  Regional  estimates 
of  aquifer  salinity  are  based  on  limited  data  (Schaefer  1983-TN3007)  and  modeling  (Pope  and 
Gordon  1999-TN3006).  Recent  estimates  place  the  250-mg/L  line  of  equal  chloride 
concentration  close  to  Artificial  Island  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948). 
Chloride  data  from  the  HCGS  and  SGS  production  wells  presented  in  Section  2. 3. 3. 2  indicate 
that  the  concentration  has  been  fairly  stable  for  the  past  10  years.  Data  presented  in  Dames 
and  Moore  (Dames  and  Moore  1 988-TN331 1 )  show  that  chloride  concentration  in  1 987  was 
15  mg/L  in  wells  HC-1  and  HC-2  and  45  mg/L  in  PW-5.  These  concentrations  are  slightly  higher 
than  the  median  values  between  March  2003  and  September  2013:  8  mg/L  in  HC-1,  5  mg/L  in 


November  2015 


5-15 


NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


HC-2,  and  22  mg/L  in  PW-5.  The  higher  concentrations  in  1987  may  have  resulted  from  higher 
pumping  rates;  combined  pumping  from  the  middle  PRM  aquifer  was  493  gpm  in  1987  and 
averaged  369  gpm  between  2002  and  2009.  However,  regional  pumping  was  also  greater  in 
the  early  1980s,  as  this  was  before  the  establishment  of  Water  Supply  Critical  Area  2  and  may 
have  influenced  chloride  concentrations  in  the  HCGS/SGS  production  wells.  Combined 
pumping  for  HCGS/SGS  and  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  is  expected  to  average  579  gpm  from 
the  middle  PRM  aquifer  (369  gpm  plus  210  gpm),  less  than  100  gpm  (17  percent)  more  than  the 
1987  withdrawals. 

Dames  and  Moore  (1988-TN331 1 )  used  modeling  to  evaluate  the  potential  for  saltwater 
intrusion  from  expansion  of  HCGS/SGS  groundwater  pumping  from  the  middle  PRM  aquifer. 
They  considered  scenarios  with  598  gpm  and  736  gpm  of  pumping  from  the  middle  PRM 
aquifer.  The  higher  pumping  rates  produced  increases  in  chloride  concentrations  of 
17  and  24  mg/L,  respectively,  in  well  PW-5  and  an  increase  of  2-5  mg/L  in  wells  HC-1  and 
HC-2.  The  magnitude  of  these  increases  is  similar  to  the  differences  between  chloride 
concentration  in  1987  and  median  chloride  concentrations  during  2003-2013. 

The  available  data  and  the  modeling  results  suggest  that  operational  pumping  for  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  would  increase  chloride  concentrations  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer,  but  these 
increases  would  be  manageable.  Additional  factors  that  would  limit  the  impacts  are  the  lack  of 
significant  nearby  groundwater  use  and  the  availability  of  the  upper  PRM  aquifer  as  an 
alternative  water  source.  The  presence  of  aquitards  (Marshalltown,  Woodbury,  and 
Merchantville  Formations)  between  the  PRM  aquifers  and  the  overlying  saltwater-impacted 
aquifers  also  limits  the  potential  for  saline  intrusion  from  the  Vincentown  and  Wenonah-Mount 
Laurel  aquifers.  In  addition,  results  from  Pope  and  Gordon  (Pope  and  Gordon  1999-TN3006) 
showed  that  changes  in  aquifer  salinity  have  been  more  responsive  to  historic  sea  levels  than  to 
the  regional  groundwater  withdrawals  in  the  20th  century.  Therefore,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  the  groundwater  quality  impacts  from  the  operational  use  of  groundwater  by  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL,  and  no  further  mitigation  would  be 
warranted. 

5.2.4  Water  Monitoring 

Discharge  monitoring  of  all  waste  streams  is  required  to  demonstrate  compliance  with  NJPDES 
limits.  PSEG  anticipates  that  surface-water  monitoring  requirements  for  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant’s  NJPDES  permit  would  be  similar  to  those  for  the  HCGS  and  SGS.  These  monitoring 
requirements  would  include  continuous  temperature  monitoring  at  cooling  water  intake 
structures  and  at  the  discharge  point.  Because  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  be  a  new  facility  under  Phase  I  requirements  of  40  CFR  125.84,  monitoring  to 
demonstrate  compliance  with  40  CFR  125.87  would  be  required  under  the  NJPDES  permit  and 
would  include  monitoring  of  intake  velocity  (40  CFR  Part  125-TN254). 

Section  6.3  of  PSEG’s  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  describes  the  hydrological  monitoring  program 
that  would  be  used  to  control  potential  adverse  impacts  of  new  plant  operations  on  surface 
water  and  groundwater  and  identifies  alternatives  or  engineering  measures  that  could  be 
implemented  to  reduce  these  impacts.  Section  6.6  of  the  ER  describes  the  chemical  monitoring 


NUREG-2168 


5-16 


November  2015 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


program  for  surface-water  and  groundwater  quality.  The  objective  of  chemical  monitoring  is  to 
identify  changes  in  water  quality  that  may  result  from  new  plant  operations. 

PSEG  maintains  a  Radiological  Groundwater  Protection  Program  (RGPP)  and  tritium 
remediation  monitoring  wells.  The  wells  installed  for  the  RGPP  at  HCGS  and  SGS  and  for 
tritium  remediation  monitoring  at  SGS  are  generally  located  in  the  shallow  water-bearing  strata 
or  the  Vincentown  aquifer,  consistent  with  the  wells  installed  in  conjunction  with  the  ESP 
application.  A  monitoring  plan  would  be  developed  for  the  final  selected  plant  design  to  monitor 
potential  impacts  of  plant  operations  on  the  groundwater. 

5.3  Ecological  Impacts 

This  section  describes  the  potential  impacts  to  ecological  resources  from  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  impacts  are  discussed  separately  for  terrestrial 
ecosystems  (see  Section  5.3.1)  and  aquatic  ecosystems  (see  Section  5.3.2). 

5.3.1  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Impacts  Related  to  Operations 

The  main  concerns  regarding  potential  impacts  on  terrestrial  ecological  resources  from  the 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  associated  with  cooling  system 
operations.  Cooling  system  operations  can  result  in  the  deposition  of  dissolved  solids: 
increased  local  fogging,  precipitation,  or  icing;  a  greater  risk  of  bird  and  bat  collision  mortality: 
shoreline  alteration  of  the  source  water  body;  and  noise.  The  addition  of  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  also  result  in  increased  traffic  along  the  proposed  causeway  from 
additional  employees  at  the  site  (NRC  2013-TN2654;  NRC  1999-TN289). 

5.3. 7. 7  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Resources  -  Site  and  Vicinity 

Cooling  System  Impacts  on  Vegetation 

Cooling  system  operations  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  pose  the  most 
significant  risks  to  vegetation.  The  proposed  cooling  systems,  as  described  in  Chapter  3.  would 
use  a  recirculating  (closed-cycle)  cooling  water  system  that  includes  natural  draft  cooling  towers 
(NDCTs),  mechanical  draft  cooling  towers  (MDCTs),  or  fan-assisted  cooling  towers  during 
normal  operations.  The  circulating  water  system  (CWS)  cooling  towers  would  be  the  tallest 
structures  onsite  at  a  potential  height  of  590  ft  and  would  dissipate  heat  at  a  rate  of  1 .508  *  10'- 
Btu/hr  with  evaporation  losses  as  high  as  25,264  gpm  and  a  drift  loss  as  high  as  12  gpm.  The 
service  water  system  (SWS)  would  provide  cooling  functions  for  systems  not  serviced  by  the 
CWS  during  operation  and  during  cool  down,  refueling,  and  plant  start-up  modes.  The  shorter 
SWS  cooling  towers  would  dissipate  heat  at  a  maximum  rate  of  2,284  gpm  and  a  maximum  drift 
loss  of  4  gpm.  Because  the  impacts  from  the  SWS  cooling  towers  would  be  less  than  the  CWS 
cooling  towers,  discussion  of  potential  impacts  as  a  result  of  cooling  system  operations  will  be 
limited  to  the  CWS  cooling  towers  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Heat  from  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  transferred  to  the  atmosphere  in  the 
form  of  water  vapor  and  drift  from  cooling  towers.  Vapor  plumes  and  drift  can  affect  crops, 
ornamental  vegetation,  and  native  plants,  and  water  losses  can  affect  shoreline  habitat.  Total 
dissolved  solids  (TDS)  found  in  the  vapor  and  drift  have  the  potential  to  be  deposited  onto 
foliage  or  soil  and  cause  visible  damage  (e.g.,  necrotic  tissue  and  other  deformities)  and/or

chronic  effects  (e.g.,  reduced  growth  and  increased  susceptibility  to  disease).  NUREG-1555, 
Section  5. 3. 3. 2  (NRC  2000-TN614)  indicates  that  plants  are  generally  not  damaged  by  salt 
deposition  rates  of  1  to  2  kg/ha/mo.  Salt  deposition  rates  greater  than  10  kg/ha/mo  during  the 
growing  season  have  the  potential  to  cause  leaf  damage  in  some  vegetation  species. 

The  linear  mechanical  draft  cooling  tower  (LMDCT)  has  greater  potential  for  salt  drift  than  other 
proposed  cooling  tower  structures.  Therefore,  discussion  of  salt  deposition  as  a  result  of 
cooling  tower  drift  will  be  limited  to  the  deposition  rate  of  the  LMDCT.  The  results  of  Seasonal 
and  Annual  Cooling  Tower  Impact  (SACTI)  Prediction  Code  modeling  conducted  by  PSEG  and 
confirmed  by  the  staffs  independent  analysis  for  the  proposed  site  shows  that  the  maximum  salt 
deposition  rate  during  any  season  is  1.31  kg/ha/mo  (1.17  Ib/ac/mo)  during  the  winter.  The 
maximum  expected  salt  deposition  rate  in  any  direction  is  0.89  kg/ha/mo  (0.80  Ib/ac/mo) 

(Table  5-1)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  These  salt  deposition  rates  fall  within  the  rate  described  by 
NUREG-1555  as  generally  not  damaging  to  plants  (NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999-TN289). 

Analyses  performed  by  PSEG  have  shown  that  cooling  tower  drift  over  terrestrial  habitats  is 
primarily  to  the  east  (within  coastal  wetlands)  (Figure  5-3)  and  southeast  on  the  PSEG  Site. 

Most  of  the  plant  communities  within  the  salt  drift  zone  that  would  be  exposed  to  drift  from  the 
PSEG  cooling  towers  are  salt  marsh  or  brackish  marsh  ecosystems  dominated  by  species 
( Phragmites  australis  and  Spartina  alterniflora)  with  medium  to  high  salinity  tolerance.  Surveys 
conducted  previously  at  the  PSEG  Site  did  not  record  any  impacts  from  salt  deposition  due  to 
drift  from  the  existing  HCGS  NDCT  for  any  specific  plant  species.  Damage  to  native  vegetation 
has  not  occurred  at  HCGS,  which  uses  brackish  water  for  cooling  and  represents  a 
comparatively  high  probability  of  impact  from  operation  of  NDCTs  (NRC  1996-TN288; 

NRC  1999-TN289;  PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Previous  evaluations  of  increased  fogging,  icing,  humidity,  and/or  precipitation  caused  by 
cooling  tower  plumes  have  been  conducted  for  nuclear  power  plants  with  cooling  towers 
(natural  draft  and  mechanical  draft).  No  significant  impacts  were  reported  as  a  result  of  these 
evaluations  (NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999-TN289).  In  addition,  based  on  an  analysis 
conducted  for  the  PSEG  Site,  the  duration  of  any  fogging  and  other  cooling  tower-induced 
precipitation  events  would  be  expected  to  be  short  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Based  on  these  results,  combined  with  the  nature  of  the  local  plant  communities,  the  potential 
effects  of  cooling  tower  operations  on  surrounding  plant  communities  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  in 
the  vicinity  would  be  expected  to  be  minimal.

Noise  Impacts 

Noise  from  nuclear  power  plants  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  behavior  patterns  of  wildlife  species 
in  the  vicinity  (NRC  201 3-TN2654).  Principal  noise  sources  at  a  nuclear  power  plant  include 
natural  draft  and  mechanical  draft  cooling  towers,  transformers,  and  loudspeakers.  The 
bounding  level  for  noise  emissions  from  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  is  associated  with  fan-assisted  NDCTs,  as  presented  in  the  Site  Safety  Analysis  Report 
(PSEG  2015-TN4283).  The  estimated  “A”  weighted  noise  emission  for  this  type  of  cooling  tower 
is  60  decibels  (dBA)  at  1 ,000  ft.  Noise  measurements  recorded  on  the  site  demonstrate  that 
existing  noise  levels  attenuate  to  a  maximum  of  51 .6  dBA  (a  value  typical  of  ambient  low  noise 
environments)  near  the  site  boundary  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Noise  from  onsite  sources  associated  with  the  PSEG  Site  attenuates  with  distance.  For 
example,  a  source  with  a  noise  level  of  50  dBA  at  1 ,000  ft  has  a  noise  level  of  44  dBA  at 
2,000  ft  from  the  source,  and  a  source  with  a  noise  level  of  60  dBA  at  1 ,000  ft  has  a  dBA  of  54 
at  2,000  ft.  A  2009  baseline  ambient  noise  survey  indicates  noise  from  sources  at  the  existing 
HCGS  and  SGS  facilities  attenuates  to  levels  that  generally  represent  background  noise  values 
in  natural  environments  (see  Table  5-2).  This  noise  level  is  similar  to  that  measured  near  the 
PSEG  Site  boundary.  Noise  sources  within  the  adjacent  marsh  environment  include  wind, 
rustling  of  reeds  and  grasses  ( Phragmites ),  and  animal  noises  (frog  calls,  bird  songs,  etc.). 

There  are  no  known  Federally  listed  threatened  or  endangered  terrestrial  species  within  the 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  that  potentially  could  be  impacted  by  the  noise  of  plant  operations  (see 
Section  2.4.1).  In  addition,  the  expected  noise  level  is  well  below  threshold  levels  that  would 
generally  exhibit  a  response  in  wildlife  populations,  as  further  discussed  in  Section  4.3.1 .1 . 

Thus,  impacts  of  noise  from  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  are  expected  to  be  minimal.

Impacts  of  Avian  and  Bat  Collisions  with  Power  Plant  Structures 

Avian  mortality  resulting  from  bird  collisions  with  NDCTs  at  nuclear  plants  is  a  potential  concern. 
Existing  literature  suggests  that  structures  at  a  height  approximately  300  ft  or  taller  tend  to 
exhibit  higher  tendencies  for  bird  collisions  and  mortality  rates  (Kerlinger  2000-TN3188). 
Because  an  NDCT  could  potentially  be  600  ft  tall,  it  has  the  potential  to  cause  increased  bird 
mortality  rates.  The  NRC  concluded  that  relatively  shorter  mechanical  draft  towers  tend  to 
cause  negligible  mortality  rates  (NRC  2013-TN2654). 

As  described  in  Section  2. 4. 1.1,  the  PSEG  Site  is  within  the  Atlantic  Flyway  and  has  the 
potential  for  a  higher  number  of  avian  collisions.  PSEG  completed  a  report  on  avian  collisions 
at  HCGS  to  NJDEP  in  1 987.  The  report  was  based  on  studies  of  bird  collisions  because  of  the 
512  ft  NDCT  at  the  site.  There  were  30  mortalities  at  the  HCGS  site  during  the  year-long  study 
lasting  from  February  1985  to  January  1986,  and  no  Federally  or  State-listed  endangered  or 
threatened  species  were  among  the  mortalities  documented.  At  the  end  of  the  study  period, 
PSEG  concluded  that  the  HCGS  cooling  towers  appeared  to  be  an  insignificant  source  of  bird 
collisions  and  mortality  (PSEG  1987-TN2893). 

NRC  studies  found  that  bird  mortalities  do  occur  at  nuclear  power  plants,  but  such  mortalities 
decreased  when  proper  illumination  was  installed  on  the  towers.  Additionally,  the  NRC 
concluded  that  avian  collisions  with  nuclear  power  plant  structures  occur  at  rates  that  are 
unlikely  to  pose  a  significant  source  of  mortality  to  migratory  bird  populations  (NRC  2013- 
TN2654).  As  a  result,  bird  collisions  with  additional  structures  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  expected  to 
have  a  negligible  effect  on  resident  and  migratory  bird  populations. 

Literature  regarding  bat  collisions  with  cooling  tower  structures  is  limited.  However,  several 
studies  have  been  completed  regarding  bat  collisions  with  other  human-made  structures. 
Mortalities  because  of  collisions  with  television  and  communication  towers  were  recorded 
involving  eastern  red  ( Lasiurus  borealis ),  hoary  ( Lasiurus  cinereus),  and  silver-haired  bats 
(Lasionycteris  noctivagans).  These  incidents  have  been  recorded  in  Kansas,  Florida,  Missouri, 
North  Dakota,  and  Tennessee.  Similarly,  bats  have  been  known  to  collide  with  tall  buildings  in 
New  York  City  and  Chicago  (Erickson  et  al.  2002-TN77 1 ). 

Bat  mortalities  because  of  collisions  with  wind  turbines  are  well  documented.  Over  360  bats 
were  collected  from  wind  turbines  in  Minnesota,  and  the  highest  mortality  rate  of  32  bat 
mortalities  per  three  wind  turbines  was  recorded  at  a  wind  generating  facility  in  Tennessee. 

Only  6  of  the  39  species  of  bats  that  are  known  to  occur  in  the  United  States  were  affected. 

Most  of  the  mortalities  occurred  in  late  summer  to  early  fall  and  involved  mostly  migratory  tree 
bat  species.  These  migratory  species  included  mostly  hoary  bats,  eastern  red  bats,  and  silver- 
hair  bats.  Other  species  found  in  smaller  numbers  included  big  brown  bats  ( Eptesicus  fuscus), 
little  brown  bats  ( Myotis  lucifugus),  and  tri-colored  bats  ( Perimyotis  subflavus).  The  study 
suggests  that  bat  species  do  not  use  echolocation  during  migration,  which  can  result  in  higher 
rates  of  collision  with  human-made  structures.  Fewer  collisions  occurred  with  resident  bat 
populations  that  forage  near  these  structures.  Additionally,  evidence  suggests  that  bat 
collisions  with  human-made  structures  are  not  a  significant  source  of  population  declines 
(Erickson  et  al.  2002-TN771).

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Impacts  of  Artificial  Light 

Artificial  light  can  impact  wildlife  by  both  disorientation  and  attraction.  Nighttime  migrating  bird 
species  can  be  impacted  when  meteorological  conditions,  such  as  inclement  weather,  bring 
them  into  close  proximity  with  artificial  lighting.  Birds  may  become  disoriented  and  collide  with 
each  other  or  structures,  become  exhausted,  or  be  taken  by  predators  (Longcore  2004- 
TN3189).  Artificial  lighting  may  impact  terrestrial  mammal  nocturnal  predator-prey  relationships 
(Beier  2006-TN2380).  Light  pollution  also  may  have  significant  negative  impacts  on  the 
selection  of  flight  routes  by  bats  (Stone  et  al.  2009-TN3190).  When  exposed  to  artificial  light, 
green  frogs  were  found  to  exhibit  fewer  advertisement  calls  and  moved  more  frequently  than 
they  did  under  ambient  light  conditions;  this  could  result  in  potential  impacts  on  recruitment 
rates,  leading  to  effects  on  population  dynamics  (Baker  and  Richardson  2006-TN2379). 

Down  shielding  of  lights  to  prevent  light  from  being  directed  into  the  night  sky  can  help  reduce 
their  effects  on  migratory  birds.  This  means  lights  can  be  shielded  so  that  the  pattern  of 
illumination  is  below  the  horizontal  plane  of  the  light  fixture.  However,  this  will  not  prevent 
potential  impacts  to  other  species,  such  as  frogs  (Longcore  2004-TN3189). 

The  impacts  of  additional  lighting  could  be  lessened  by  using  low  sodium  lighting.  Down 
shielding,  as  described  above,  could  be  employed  to  further  mitigate  certain  impacts.  Operating 
experience  at  the  HCGS  has  not  shown  that  bird  collisions  with  units  have  been  a  noticeable 
issue  (PSEG  1987-TN2893).  It  is  not  expected  that  the  incremental  effect  of  lighting  added  for  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  would  increase  impacts  to  noticeable  levels,  particularly  if  down 
shielding  and  other  best  management  practices  (BMPs)  were  employed.  With  the  use  of 
appropriate  BMPs,  impacts  to  terrestrial  wildlife  from  the  additional  lighting  at  the  PSEG  Site  are 
expected  to  be  minimal.  Further  discussion  of  potential  impacts  of  artificial  lighting  on  terrestrial 
resources  can  be  found  in  Section  4.3.1 .1 . 

Impacts  of  increased  Vehicle  Traffic 

Increased  vehicle  traffic  as  a  result  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
has  the  potential  to  increase  wildlife  mortality  caused  by  vehicle  collisions.  PSEG  estimates  that 
the  onsite  workforce  could  increase  by  600  employees  during  normal  operations  and  by 
1,000  employees  during  refueling  operations  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  increase  in  workforce 
population  would  increase  the  amount  of  vehicle  traffic  on  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity.  Local 
wildlife  populations  could  decline  if  road-kill  rates  exceed  the  rates  of  reproduction  and 
immigration.  However,  road-kills  occur  frequently  and  wildlife  populations  are  not  significantly 
affected  (Forman  and  Alexander  1998-TN2250).  No  individual  Federally  or  State-listed 
threatened  or  endangered  species  were  identified  that  would  be  adversely  affected  by  vehicle 
traffic.  Therefore,  the  effect  of  increased  traffic  on  terrestrial  wildlife  populations  on  the  site  and 
in  the  vicinity  would  be  minimal. 

The  proposed  causeway  would  be  constructed  on  piers,  preserving  wildlife  travel  corridors 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  By  allowing  wildlife  travel  below  the  causeway,  this  elevated  design 
would  also  help  minimize  the  possibility  for  wildlife-vehicle  collisions  and  wildlife  mortality  on 
conventional  roadways  built  on  embankments.  The  elevated  design  would  also  minimize 
potential  impacts  to  plant  communities  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Permanent  impacts  to  wetland

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


plant  communities  along  the  causeway  would  be  limited  to  placement  of  piers  and  direct 
shading.  Shading  could  potentially  result  in  some  alteration  of  plant  community  makeup  under 
the  causeway  and  a  reduction  in  primary  productivity.  However,  because  the  effect  will  be  to  a 
small  area  relative  to  the  overall  plant  community,  impacts  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

Impacts  to  Shoreline  Habitat 

Based  on  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  (Figure  2-2),  the  western  shoreline  of  the  PSEG  Site 
would  be  modified  with  the  development  of  shoreline  plant  features  that  include  the  water  intake 
structure,  heavy  haul  road,  and  barge  facility.  In  total,  9.5  ac  of  nearshore  water  and  riparian 
shoreline  would  be  impacted  below  the  coastal  wetland  boundary,  also  known  as  the  New 
Jersey  upper  wetland  boundary.  Based  on  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan,  the  shoreline  would 
be  constructed  as  a  stabilized  shoreline  (using  riprap  or  other  appropriate  treatment) 

(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  This  would  be  the  condition  of  the  shoreline  during  the  operational 
phase  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  existing  disturbed  nature  of  the  shoreline  likely  provides  marginal  habitat  for  most  terrestrial 
species.  The  main  use  of  these  areas  is  likely  by  some  riparian  zone/edge  birds,  as  well  as 
waterfowl  and  other  birds  on  the  open  water.  Open  water  habitat  would  remain  during  the 
operational  phase,  but  the  riparian  zone  would  provide  little  habitat  after  the  installation  of  the 
riprap  bank.  However,  there  are  large  areas  of  similar  shoreline  habitat  of  higher  quality  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  site.  Therefore,  it  is  expected  that  the  shoreline  modifications  in  place  during  the 
operational  stage  would  have  a  negligible  impact  on  terrestrial  wildlife  populations. 

5. 3. 1.2  Important  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Species  and  Habitats  -  Operational  Impacts 

This  section  discusses  the  potential  impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  on  recreationally  valuable  species  and  Federally  and  State-listed  species,  as  well  as 
important  habitats  (including  wetlands)  as  defined  by  the  NRC  (NRC  2000-TN614).  To  meet 
responsibilities  under  Section  7  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act  of  1 973,  as  amended  (16  USC 
1531  et  seq.  -TNI 010),  the  review  team  is  preparing  a  biological  assessment  (BA)  that 
evaluates  potential  impacts  of  preconstruction,  construction,  and  operations  on  Federally  listed 
or  proposed  threatened  or  endangered  aquatic  and  terrestrial  and  wetland  species  (see 
Appendix  F).  There  are  no  areas  designated  as  critical  habitat  on  the  PSEG  Site,  in  the  6-mi 
vicinity,  or  along  the  proposed  causeway. 

Recreationally  and  commercially  valuable  species  include  those  that  are  routinely  hunted,  such 
as  white-tailed  deer  ( Odocoileus  virginianus)  and  a  number  of  avian  species.  There  are  also 
two  valuable  furbearer  species  in  the  area  (i.e.,  river  otter  and  muskrat). 

Most  of  the  species  identified  on  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity  are  common  to  the  region  (see 
Section  2.4.1 ).  Those  rare  or  listed  species  that  could  potentially  occur  on  the  site  more  likely 
frequent  higher  quality  habitat  in  the  region.

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


PSEG  Site  and  Vicinity 

Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Species  of  Recreational  or  Commercial  Value 

Recreationally  valuable  species  that  would  be  affected  by  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  include  numerous  avian  species  and  mammal  species.  As  discussed  in 
Section  4. 3. 1.2,  most  habitats  available  for  recreationally  valuable  species  on  the  PSEG  Site 
and  in  the  vicinity  are  common  to  the  region.  As  described  in  Section  5. 3. 1.1,  avian  species 
have  the  potential  to  be  affected  by  plant  structures.  There  is  no  evidence  linking  any  species 
present  on  the  site  to  critical  structure  or  function  at  the  ecosystem  level  or  that  any  species 
would  serve  as  a  biological  indicator. 

Federally  or  State-Listed  Threatened  or  Endangered  Species 

The  Federally  and  State-listed  species  that  have  the  potential  to  occur  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  in 
the  vicinity  are  described  in  Section  2. 4. 1.3  (Table  2-8).  The  only  Federally  listed  species  with  a 
recent  record  of  occurrence  in  the  vicinity  are  the  bog  turtle  ( Gyptemys  muhlenbergii),  northern 
long-eared  bat,  and  swamp  pink  ( Helonias  bullata).  All  of  these  species  are  discussed  below. 

Reptiles  and  Amphibians.  The  bog  turtle  is  Federally  listed  as  threatened  and  is  listed  by  both 
New  Jersey  and  Delaware  as  endangered.  This  species  was  recorded  historically  on  Artificial 
Island  and  in  the  vicinity  during  a  study  conducted  between  1972  and  1978.  However,  there 
were  no  records  for  this  species  in  the  latest  surveys  conducted  by  PSEG  in  2009  and  2010 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Although  the  most  recent  distribution  for  bog  turtles  includes  Salem 
County,  the  PSEG  Site  does  not  currently  contain  suitable  habitat  for  this  species.  In  addition, 
the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  (FWS)  previously  indicated  that  this  species  is  not  known  to 
occur  on  or  in  the  vicinity  of  the  HCGS  and  SGS  sites  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ).  Bog  turtles  require 
large  contiguous  areas  of  land  for  dispersal,  and  intense  land  uses  such  as  those  found  on  the 
PSEG  Site  are  not  favorable  to  this  species.  Furthermore,  monocultures  of  invasive  species, 
such  as  Phragmites,  are  not  conducive  to  bog  turtle  presence.  In  a  worst-case  scenario,  salt 
drift  could  affect  potential  bog  turtle  habitat  in  the  vicinity.  However,  the  chances  of  this 
happening  are  thought  to  be  minimal  because  no  damage  to  native  vegetation  has  been 
recorded  for  HCGS  (NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999-TN289).  Therefore,  it  is  not  expected  that 
the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  impact  this  species. 

The  eastern  tiger  salamander  ( Ambystoma  tigrinum  tigrinum )  is  listed  as  endangered  by  both 
New  Jersey  and  Delaware.  This  species  was  recorded  historically  during  the  Artificial  Island 
study  (1972  to  1978).  There  were  no  records  for  this  species  in  the  latest  surveys  conducted  by 
PSEG  in  2009  and  2010  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  altered  habitat  present  on  the  PSEG  Site 
would  not  appear  to  be  conducive  to  supporting  tiger  salamander  populations.  In  addition, 
surveys  of  this  species  conducted  in  1995  revealed  that  the  tiger  salamander  occurred  at  only  a 
limited  number  of  sites  in  Atlantic  and  Cumberland  Counties.  Therefore,  the  operations  phase 
of  the  PSEG  project  would  not  be  expected  to  impact  this  species. 

Birds.  The  nearest  known  occurrence  of  the  rufa  red  knot  ( Calidris  canutus  rufa)  is  in  adjacent 
Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey,  and  Kent  County,  Delaware.  This  species  has  the  potential 
to  be  impacted  by  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (79  FR  73705- 


NUREG-2168 


5-24 


November  2015 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


TN4267),  but  there  are  no  known  populations  of  the  rufa  red  knot  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  bird 
was  not  recorded  during  previous  bird  surveys  (PSEG  1987-TN2893;  PSEG  2015-TN4280; 
Audubon  2013-TN2414).  The  primary  risk  to  the  rufa  red  knot  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  from 
potential  collisions  with  power  plant  structures  during  migration.  The  PSEG  Site  does  not 
contain  suitable  habitat  or  forage  to  support  this  species. 

Eight  birds  of  prey  were  identified  as  important  species.  These  include  the  Cooper’s  hawk 
(• Accipiter  cooperii ),  northern  goshawk,  red-shouldered  hawk  ( Buteo  lineatus),  northern  harrier 
( Circus  cyaneus ),  bald  eagle  ( Haliaeetus  leucocephalus),  osprey  ( Pandion  haliaetus),  American 
kestrel  ( Falco  sparverius),  and  peregrine  falcon  ( Falco  peregrinus). 

The  Cooper's  hawk  is  listed  as  a  species  of  special  concern  in  New  Jersey  (Table  2-8). 

Cooper's  hawks  prefer  large  tracts  of  forested  land  where  they  nest  in  large,  mature  trees.  One 
was  observed  in  a  small  tree  on  the  site  in  the  fall  of  2009.  Preferred  habitat  for  this  species  is 
not  present  on  the  site,  and  Cooper’s  hawks  are  more  likely  residents  of  forested  habitat  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Use  of  habitat  at  the  PSEG  Site  by  this  species  is  most  likely  of  a 
transient  nature.  Therefore,  operations-related  impacts  to  Cooper’s  hawks  are  expected  to  be 
minimal. 

Northern  goshawks,  listed  as  endangered  for  the  breeding  population  and  of  special  concern  for 
the  nonbreeding  population  in  New  Jersey  (Table  2-8),  have  been  reported  in  the  project  vicinity 
during  recent  (2008  to  2009)  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Counts  for  Salem  County 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280;  Audubon  2013-TN2414).  The  PSEG  Site  contains  no  potential  breeding 
habitat  for  goshawks  and  probably  would  provide  only  marginal  nonbreeding  season  habitat  for 
this  species  during  the  operations  stage  of  the  project.  Given  the  abundance  of  nonbreeding 
season  habitat  in  the  site  vicinity  and  the  actual  rarity  of  this  species  in  the  area,  any  impacts  to 
the  northern  goshawk  would  be  expected  to  be  minimal. 

The  red-shouldered  hawk,  a  New  Jersey-listed  endangered  species  (Table  2-8),  has  been 
identified  in  recent  years  near  the  PSEG  Site  during  the  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas 
Bird  Counts  for  Salem  County  as  discussed  in  Section  2.4.1.  However,  no  red-shouldered 
hawks  were  observed  on  the  site  during  the  2009  to  2010  PSEG  field  survey.  There  is  no 
breeding  habitat  for  this  species  on  the  PSEG  Site,  and  this  species  probably  only  uses  the  site 
transiently.  Preferred  habitat  for  this  species  is  available  in  the  site  vicinity.  Therefore, 
operations-related  impacts  to  red-shouldered  hawks  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

The  northern  harrier,  listed  as  endangered  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  (Table  2-8),  was 
commonly  observed  foraging  in  the  coastal  wetlands  on  the  site  and  in  proximity  to  the  site. 
Nests  were  not  observed  on  the  site  during  the  2009  to  2010  field  surveys;  however,  nesting 
habitat  in  the  coastal  marsh  is  present  on  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity.  Onsite  habitat  would  have 
already  been  reduced  by  the  time  of  operations,  with  abundant  higher  quality  habitat  remaining 
in  the  vicinity.  The  northern  harrier  has  remained  a  common  species  in  the  area  with  ongoing 
operations  at  the  nearby  HCGS  and  SGS  facilities.  Therefore,  it  would  not  be  expected  that  this 
species  would  be  impacted  significantly  with  the  addition  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the 
PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  impacts  to  the  northern  harrier  during  the  operations  stage  are  expected 
to  be  minimal.

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Owing  to  its  successful  recovery,  the  bald  eagle  is  no  longer  a  Federally  listed  species  by  the 
FWS.  The  bald  eagle  was  identified  as  important  because  of  its  status  as  a  Federally  protected 
species  (16  USC  703  et  seq.  -TN3331;  16  USC  668  et  seq.  -TN1447)  and  as  a  State-listed 
endangered  species  for  both  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  (Table  2-8).  Although  bald  eagles  were 
occasionally  observed  during  the  2009  to  2010  onsite  field  survey,  there  are  no  known  bald 
eagle  nests  or  suitable  roosting  habitat  at  the  PSEG  Site.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  absence 
of  large  trees  or  suitable  structures  that  could  support  nesting  activities.  Therefore,  operations- 
related  impacts  to  the  bald  eagle  are  expected  to  be  minimal  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Ospreys,  a  threatened  species  in  New  Jersey  and  a  species  of  special  concern  in  Delaware 
(Table  2-8),  were  occasionally  observed  both  on  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site 
during  the  2009  to  2010  field  survey.  Active  osprey  nests  were  observed  on  transmission 
towers  along  the  current  access  road,  on  the  transmission  towers  that  run  from  the  proposed 
site  north  towards  Money  Island  Road,  and  on  human-made  nesting  platforms  constructed  by 
PSEG  along  Alloway  Creek.  Potential  nesting  habitat  in  the  form  of  additional  transmission 
towers  may  be  more  plentiful  after  the  construction  phase  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  The 
osprey  has  remained  a  common  species  in  the  area  with  ongoing  operations  at  the  nearby 
HCGS  and  SGS  facilities.  Therefore,  it  would  not  be  expected  that  this  species  would  be 
significantly  impacted  by  the  addition  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Consequently,  impacts  to 
the  osprey  during  the  operations  stage  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

American  kestrels,  listed  as  threatened  in  New  Jersey  (Table  2-8),  have  been  reported  in  the 
PSEG  Site  vicinity  by  the  USGS  North  American  Breeding  Bird  Survey  (BBS)  and  during  recent 
(2005-2010)  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Counts  for  Salem  County  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280;  Audubon  2013-TN2414).  This  species  was  also  recorded  during  past  work  conducted 
in  the  Alloway  Creek  Watershed  (PSEG  2004-TN2897).  The  species  was  not  recorded  on  the 
site  during  the  2009  to  2010  PSEG  survey.  This  species  prefers  open  country.  A  relatively 
small  amount  of  potential  American  kestrel  habitat  would  be  permanently  disturbed  by  building 
activities  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  causeway,  and  mitigation  of  those  areas  temporarily  disturbed 
may  actually  improve  habitat  for  this  species  during  the  operations  phase.  Large  areas  of 
higher  quality  and  more  suitable  habitat  are  also  present  in  the  site  vicinity.  Consequently, 
impacts  on  kestrels  during  the  operations  phase  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

Peregrine  falcons,  listed  as  endangered  for  the  breeding  population  and  of  special  concern  for 
the  nonbreeding  population  in  New  Jersey  (Table  2-8),  have  been  reported  in  the  PSEG  Site 
vicinity  during  recent  (2005  to  2006)  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Counts  for  Salem 
County  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  Audubon  2013-TN2414).  There  are  no  records  for  nesting 
peregrine  falcons  in  Salem  County.  Any  expected  use  of  the  PSEG  Site  by  peregrines  would  be 
for  foraging,  which  would  most  likely  occur  in  the  winter.  This  species  favors  open  areas  for 
hunting,  frequently  hunting  over  marshes,  beaches,  and  open  water.  There  would  be  some  loss 
of  potential  foraging  habitat  (i.e. ,  wetlands)  for  this  species  because  of  onsite  and  causeway 
development.  However,  large  areas  of  higher  quality  suitable  habitat  exist  in  the  site  vicinity, 
and  it  is  more  likely  that  peregrines  would  use  this  higher  quality  adjacent  habitat.  Therefore, 
impacts  on  peregrine  falcons  during  the  operations  phase  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

A  number  of  wading  birds  have  been  documented  on  and  adjacent  to  the  PSEG  Site  during  past 
surveys.  Several  of  these  species  have  listed  status  in  New  Jersey  and/or  Delaware 


NUREG-2168

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


(Table  2-8).  The  list  includes  the  following  State-designated  species  of  concern:  great  blue 
heron  ( Ardea  herodias),  little  blue  heron  ( Egretta  caerulea),  snowy  egret  ( Egretta  thula ),  and 
glossy  ibis  ( Plegadis  falcinellus).  State-listed  endangered  and  threatened  species  include 
black-crowned  night-heron  ( Nycticorax  nycticorax)  and  cattle  egret  ( Bubulcus  ibis).  An 
additional  State-listed  species,  the  pied-billed  grebe  (Podilymbus  podiceps),  has  been  observed 
in  low  numbers  during  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Counts  for  Salem  County. 
Common  terns  ( Sterna  hirundo),  State-designated  species  of  concern,  also  have  been  recorded 
at  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity.  Spotted  sandpipers  ( Actitis  macularius ),  New  Jersey  State- 
designated  species  of  concern,  may  also  frequent  such  areas.  There  are  no  known  heron/egret 
rookeries  or  tern  colonies  on  the  PSEG  Site.  The  PSEG  Site  does  contain  potential  foraging 
habitat  that  would  be  impacted  permanently  by  construction.  However,  large  areas  of  similar 
habitat  exist  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site.  In  addition,  these  species  have  continued  to  frequent  the 
area  with  ongoing  operations  at  the  nearby  HCGS  and  SGS  facilities  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
Therefore,  impacts  to  these  species  during  the  operations  phase  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

A  number  of  New  Jersey  and/or  Delaware  State-listed  bird  species  that  typically  frequent  old 
fields  and  other  open  habitats  have  been  recorded  on  or  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  These 
include  State-designated  species  of  concern,  including  brown  thrasher  ( Toxostoma  rufum), 
eastern  meadowlark  ( Sturnella  magna ),  and  yellow-breasted  chat  ( Icteria  virens).  Additionally, 
State-listed  endangered  and  threatened  species,  such  as  horned  lark  ( Eremophila  alpestris), 
bobolink  {Dolichonyx  oryzivorus),  grasshopper  sparrow  ( Ammodramus  savannarum),  and 
savannah  sparrow  ( Passerculus  sandwichensis),  are  known  to  occur  in  these  habitats 
(Table  2-8).  The  construction  phase  would  permanently  impact  potential  habitat  for  these 
species,  and  mitigation  to  restore  habitat  temporarily  impacted  could  actually  improve  habitat  for 
these  species  during  the  operations  phase.  In  addition,  these  species  would  most  likely  use  the 
large  areas  of  higher  quality  habitat  in  the  vicinity.  Therefore,  impacts  to  these  species  during 
the  operations  phase  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

The  red-headed  woodpecker  ( Melanerpes  erythrocephalus)  breeding  and  nonbreeding 
populations  are  listed  by  New  Jersey  as  threatened  (Table  2-8).  No  red-headed  woodpeckers 
were  observed  during  the  2009  to  2010  field  survey,  nor  have  any  been  reported  in  the  USGS 
BBS  or  the  Audubon  Society  Annual  Christmas  Bird  Counts  for  Salem  County.  In  addition,  as 
noted  in  Section  2.4.1,  the  site  and  vicinity  lack  suitable  habitat  for  this  species  (i.e. ,  open 
woods,  deciduous  forests,  forest  edges,  river  bottoms,  orchards,  grasslands  with  scattered  trees 
and  clearings,  and  dead  or  dying  trees).  Therefore,  it  is  not  expected  that  this  species  would  be 
present  during  the  operations  phase.  Consequently,  it  is  not  expected  that  there  would  be  any 
operations-related  impacts  to  red-headed  woodpeckers  as  a  result  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
at  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  northern  parula  ( Parula  americana )  and  hooded  warbler  ( Wilsonia  citrina ),  New  Jersey 
State-designated  species  of  concern,  are  two  warbler  species  recorded  during  USGS  BBS 
surveys  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site.  These  species  would  not  be  impacted  by  the  project  because 
the  site  contains  very  little  viable  habitat  to  support  them.  Only  transient  use  of  the  site  would 
be  expected  for  these  species. 

Plants.  The  sensitive  joint  vetch  ( Aeschynomene  virginica )  is  Federally  listed  as  threatened. 

The  historic  range  of  this  species  includes  New  Jersey  counties  of  Atlantic,  Burlington,  Camden,

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Cape  May,  Cumberland,  Gloucester,  Middlesex,  Monmouth,  Morris,  Ocean,  and  Salem,  and 
Delaware  counties  of  Kent,  New  Castle,  and  Sussex  (FWS  2014-TN3319).  Sensitive  joint  vetch 
is  an  obligate  wetland  species  that  occurs  in  palustrine  forested  wetlands  with  canopy  closures 
of  20  to  100  percent.  There  were  no  records  of  occurrences  during  studies  conducted  between 
1972  and  1978  and  surveys  conducted  from  2009  to  2010  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Sensitive 
joint  vetch  is  not  expected  to  occur  on  the  PSEG  Site  because  of  the  lack  of  available  habitat. 
Thus,  operational  impacts  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  are  not 
expected  to  affect  this  species. 

Swamp  pink  ( Helonias  bullata)  and  whorled  pogonia  ( Isotria  medeoloides)  are  Federally  listed 
as  threatened.  Swamp  pink  is  an  obligate  wetlands  species  that  occurs  in  palustrine  forested 
wetlands  with  canopy  closures  of  20  to  100  percent.  Although  it  is  believed  to  occur  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site,  suitable  habitat  does  not  exist  on  the  site.  Small  whorled  pogonia 
grows  in  upland,  mid-successional,  wooded  habitats,  usually  with  mixed  deciduous/coniferous 
forest  with  canopy  trees  ranging  from  40  to  75  years  old.  Like  the  swamp  pink,  suitable  habitat 
is  not  available  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Thus,  operational  impacts  associated  with  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  are  not  expected  to  affect  these  species. 

Mammals.  The  northern  long-eared  bat  ( Myotis  septentrionalis )  is  Federally  listed  as 
threatened.  It  is  known  to  occur  in  the  northern  and  central  portions  of  Salem  County,  New 
Jersey,  and  has  the  potential  to  be  impacted  by  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  The  primary  risk  to  northern  long-eared  bats  is  from  collisions  with  power  plant 
structures.  As  mentioned  in  Section  5.3.1 .1 ,  bat  collisions  are  known  to  occur  with  human- 
made  structures.  However,  collisions  are  attributed  to  bat  migrations  near  these  structures. 
There  are  no  known  bat  populations  on  the  PSEG  Site,  and  hibernacula,  maternity  roosts,  and 
foraging  habitat  are  not  available  on  the  site.  Northern  long-eared  bat  mortality  as  a  result  of 
collisions  with  plant  structures  would  not  be  expected.  Therefore,  the  review  team  has 
determined  that  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  affect  the 
northern  long-eared  bat. 

Other  Important  Species.  Green  tree  frogs  ( Hyla  cinerea )  were  observed  on  the  site  in  small 
isolated  impounded  areas  within  the  PSEG  desilt  basin  during  the  2009  to  2010  survey 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  A  survey  conducted  in  June  and  July  2012  also  detected  this  species  in 
the  same  general  onsite  location  as  well  as  in  numerous  offsite  locations  in  the  vicinity 
(AMEC  2012-TN3187).  This  was  a  new  species  record  for  New  Jersey,  although  its  range  does 
extend  throughout  the  Delmarva  Peninsula  to  the  south  and  west.  The  range  of  this  species 
appears  to  be  expanding  and  it  is  not  listed  on  the  New  Jersey  special  concern,  threatened,  or 
endangered  species  lists.  As  discussed  in  Section  4.3.1,  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on 
the  PSEG  Site  will  alter  or  eliminate  habitat  for  this  species.  However,  the  green  tree  frog  was 
recorded  in  numerous  offsite  locations  during  the  2012  survey,  some  in  the  vicinity  of  the 
existing  HCGS  and  SGS  facilities.  Therefore,  the  impacts  of  operations  on  this  species  would 
be  expected  to  be  minimal. 

Summary  of  Operational  Impacts  on  Important  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Species  at  the  PSEG 

Site  and  Vicinity.  The  impact  on  important  terrestrial  species  resulting  from  the  operation  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  is  projected  to  be  minimal  with  no  additional 
mitigation  needed.  Habitat  available  to  important  species  that  currently  exist  on  the  PSEG  Site

where  operational  activities  would  occur  is  more  common  elsewhere  in  the  vicinity.  Avian 
collisions  with  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  structures  would  be  minimal  and  would  not  be  a 
significant  threat  to  overall  bird  populations  in  the  area.  Noise  impacts  would  be  localized  and 
would  attenuate  with  distance.  Artificial  lighting  would  not  be  expected  to  significantly  disrupt 
important  species  behaviors  beyond  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that 
operational  impacts  to  important  terrestrial  and  wetland  species  would  be  negligible.

Jurisdictional  wetlands  (i.e.,  those  that  are  regulated  by  the  USACE  under  Section  404  of  the 
Clean  Water  Act  [33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662])  are  often  more  narrowly  defined  than  wetlands 
identified  as  part  of  the  NJDEP  land  use  and  land  cover  (LULC)  classification  system  and  are 
subject  to  USACE  permitting  requirements.  Therefore,  jurisdictional  wetlands  are  evaluated 
separately  from  the  LULC  analysis  presented  in  Section  5. 3. 1.1. 

Wetland  impacts  during  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be 
limited  to  the  operation  of  cooling  towers.  Cooling  tower  impacts  on  vegetation  are  discussed  in 
Section  5.3.1 .1 .  Cooling  towers  are  expected  to  have  the  greatest  influence  on  wetland 
communities  located  to  the  east  and  southeast  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  include  salt  marsh  or 
brackish  marsh  ecosystems  dominated  by  species  (Phragmites  australis  and  Spartina 
alterniflora)  with  medium  to  high  salinity  tolerance.  Previous  surveys  of  salt  drift  from  the 
existing  HCGS  cooling  tower  did  not  show  any  damage  as  the  result  of  salt  deposition,  soil 
salinization,  fogging,  or  icing.  Analysis  conducted  for  the  PSEG  Site  did  not  indicate  a  high  rate 
of  fogging  or  other  cooling  tower-induced  precipitation  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Therefore,  the 
impacts  on  wetlands  from  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  are 
expected  to  be  minimal. 

Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA  and  Abbotts  Meadow  WMA 


As  discussed  in  Section  4.3.1 .2,  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA  and  Abbotts  Meadow  WMA  would  be 
affected  by  the  addition  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site.  The  operational 
impacts  to  these  important  areas  are  associated  with  the  proposed  causeway.  The  proposed 
causeway  would  be  elevated  above  the  surface  through  these  areas,  and  the  flow  of  water 
through  wetlands  and  open  water  is  not  expected  to  be  affected  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
However,  damage  as  a  result  of  shading  may  occur.  Less  than  1  ac  is  expected  to  be  affected, 
which  is  less  than  1  percent  of  the  total  available  WMA.  Therefore,  the  impacts  of  operating  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  on  important  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitats  on  these 
WMAs  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

Summary  of  Impacts  to  Important  Habitats  at  the  PSEG  Site 

Impacts  to  important  habitats  as  a  result  of  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the 
PSEG  Site  are  expected  to  be  minimal.  The  main  impacts  to  wetlands  would  be  from  cooling 
tower  operations.  However,  no  perceptible  impacts  are  expected  based  on  the  nature  of  the 
vegetation  and  previous  studies  that  have  been  conducted  on  salt  deposition  resulting  from

NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


cooling  towers  in  similar  environments.  Less  than  1  percent  of  the  WMAs  would  be  impacted 
because  of  shading  created  by  the  proposed  causeway.  Although  noticeable,  the  shading 
would  have  only  a  localized  impact  on  species  dependent  on  this  resource.  Therefore,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  operational  impacts  on  important  habitats  would  be  negligible. 

5. 3. 1.3  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Monitoring  During  Operations 

PSEG  does  not  plan  to  conduct  terrestrial  and  wetland  monitoring  during  the  operations  phase 
of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

5. 3. 1.4  Potential  Mitigation  Measures  for  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Impacts 

PSEG  does  not  plan  any  specific  mitigation  measures  and  controls  for  ecosystems  during  the 
operations  phase  because  any  such  impacts  are  expected  to  be  negligible  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

5. 3. 1.5  Summary  of  Impacts  to  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Ecosystems 

The  potential  impacts  on  vegetation,  birds,  and  other  wildlife  due  to  operation  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  with  natural  draft,  mechanical  draft,  or  fan-assisted  proposed 
cooling  towers  are  likely  to  be  minimal.  Owing  to  the  nature  of  the  vegetation  in  the  vicinity  of 
the  PSEG  Site  (salt  marsh  or  brackish  marsh  ecosystems  with  medium  to  high  salinity 
tolerance),  impacts  from  salt  drift  during  operations  is  expected  to  be  minimal.  In  addition, 
surveys  conducted  previously  at  the  PSEG  Site  did  not  record  any  impacts  from  salt  deposition 
because  of  drift  from  the  existing  HCGS  NDCT  for  any  specific  plant  species.  Past  research 
has  shown  that  bird  collisions  with  cooling  towers  do  not  appear  to  impact  bird  population  levels. 
In  addition,  several  years  of  data  collected  at  the  existing  HCGS  NDCT  have  shown  few 
instances  of  bird  collisions.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  operational  impacts  to 
terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  would  be  SMALL. 

5.3.2  Aquatic  Impacts  Related  to  Operations 

This  section  discusses  the  potential  impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  on  the  aquatic  resources  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  nearby  streams  and 
ponds.  A  list  of  permits  and  certifications  required  to  operate  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  is 
included  in  Section  5.2. 

5.3.2. 1  Aquatic  Resources-Site  and  Vicinity 
Delaware  River  Estuary 

All  cooling  water  for  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be 
withdrawn  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  and  impacts  associated  with  operation  of  the  water 
intake  system  would  be  limited  to  aquatic  resources  within  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  For 
aquatic  resources,  the  primary  concerns  are  related  to  the  amount  of  water  withdrawn  and  the 
amount  of  water  consumed  through  evaporation  and  the  potential  for  organisms  to  be  impinged 
on  the  intake  screens  or  entrained  into  the  cooling  water  system.  Impingement  occurs  when 
aquatic  organisms  are  drawn  into  the  cooling  water  intake  and  are  trapped  against  the  intake 


NUREG-2168

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


screens  by  the  force  of  the  water  passing  through  the  cooling  water  intake  structure  (66  FR 
65256-TN243).  Impingement  can  result  in  starvation,  exhaustion,  asphyxiation,  descaling  of 
fish,  and  other  physical  injuries  (66  FR  65256-TN243).  Entrainment  occurs  when  aquatic 
organisms  drawn  into  the  intake  structure  are  small  enough  to  pass  through  the  intake  screens 
and  the  cooling  system.  Entrained  organisms  are  usually  passively  drifting  forms  (plankton)  or 
small,  weakly  swimming  early  life  stages  offish  and  shellfish  (66  FR  65256-TN243).  As 
entrained  organisms  pass  through  the  cooling  system  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  they 
would  be  subjected  to  mechanical,  thermal,  pressure,  and  chemical  stresses. 

A  number  of  factors,  such  as  the  type  of  cooling  system,  the  design  and  location  of  the  intake 
structure,  and  the  amount  of  water  withdrawn  from  the  source  water  body  greatly  influence  the 
degree  to  which  impingement  and  entrainment  affect  aquatic  biota.  Impingement  and 
entrainment  impacts  are  regulated  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  or  its 
designees  (in  this  case,  the  NJDEP)  under  Section  31 6(b)  of  the  CWA  (33  USC  1 251  et  seq.  - 
TN662).  Section  316(b)  “requires  that  the  location,  design,  construction,  and  capacity  of  cooling 
water  intake  structures  reflect  the  best  technology  available  for  minimizing  adverse 
environmental  impact.”  A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  employ  closed-cycle 
cooling  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Depending  on  the  quality  of  the  makeup  water,  closed-cycle, 
recirculating  cooling  water  systems  can  reduce  water  use  by  96  to  98  percent  of  the  amount  that 
the  facility  would  use  if  it  employed  a  once-through  cooling  system  (66  FR  65256-TN243).  This 
significant  reduction  in  the  water  withdrawal  rate  results  in  a  corresponding  reduction  in 
impingement  and  entrainment  losses. 

The  intake  design  through-screen  velocity  is  another  factor  that  greatly  influences  the  rate  of 
impingement  of  fish  and  shellfish  at  a  facility.  In  general,  the  higher  the  through-screen  velocity, 
the  greater  the  number  of  fish  impinged.  The  EPA  has  established  a  national  standard  for  the 
maximum  design  through-screen  velocity  of  no  more  than  0.5  fps  (66  FR  65256-TN243).  The 
EPA  determined  that  species  and  life  stages  evaluated  in  various  studies  could  endure  a 
velocity  of  1 .0  fps;  they  then  applied  a  safety  factor  of  two  to  drive  the  threshold  of  0.5  fps. 

PSEG  has  stated  that  the  proposed  intake  structure  would  be  located  flush  with  the  east 
shoreline  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  would  be  designed  to  have  a  through-screen 
velocity  of  less  than  0.5  fps  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  resulting  low  through-screen  velocity 
would  reduce  the  probability  of  impingement  because  most  fish  can  swim  against  such  low 
flows  to  avoid  the  intake  screens.  The  fish  protection  system,  including  the  traveling  screens 
and  fish  return,  would  be  designed  and  operated  to  comply  with  the  NJPDES  permit  that  would 
be  issued  for  the  cooling  system  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Another  factor  affecting  impingement  and  entrainment  losses  is  the  percentage  of  the  flow  of  the 
source  water  body  past  the  site  that  is  withdrawn  by  the  station.  To  minimize  impacts,  the  EPA 
determined  that  for  estuaries  or  tidal  rivers,  intake  flow  must  be  less  than  or  equal  to  1  percent 
of  the  tidal  excursion  (one  tidal  cycle  of  flood  and  ebb)  volume  (66  FR  65256-TN243).  Makeup 
water  for  the  cooling  system  would  be  drawn  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  at  an  average 
rate  of  78,196  gpm  (174  cfs),  with  consumptive  use  at  a  rate  of  26,420  gpm  (59  cfs) 

(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Tidal  flows  near  the  PSEG  Site  average  400,000  to  472,000  cfs,  and 
the  freshwater  flow  from  the  Delaware  River  and  its  tributaries  averages  20,240  cfs.  Therefore, 
the  makeup  water  use  rate  is  less  than  0.05  percent  of  the  average  flow  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Impingement 

Because  of  its  location  on  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  would  impinge  a  variety  of  freshwater  and  marine  fish  and  shellfish. 

Data  from  the  impingement  studies  for  SGS  (once-through  cooling)  indicate  that  between 
50  and  67  finfish  species  are  impinged  each  year,  compared  to  just  under  50  species  of  finfish 
impinged  at  HCGS  (closed-cycle  cooling)  between  1986  and  1987.  However,  the  number  of 
sampling  events  differed  dramatically  between  the  two  plants  with  only  46-48  sampling  events 
at  HCGS  over  the  same  years  (1986-87)  as  the  more  than  530  sampling  events  per  year  at 
SGS  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572).  The  species  composition  in  the  screen 
samples  also  varied  between  SGS  and  HCGS  during  the  1986-87  sampling  and  varied  at  SGS 
between  the  sampling  dates  in  the  1980s  and  sampling  dates  since  2003.  Table  5-3  compares 
important,  most  abundant,  and  total  finfish  species,  as  well  as  blue  crab  ( Callinectes  sapidus ), 
impinged  at  SGS  and  HCGS  between  1986  and  1987  and  at  SGS  between  2003  and  2010. 

Within  the  1986-1987  sampling  years,  species  composition  differed  between  SGS  and  HCGS. 
Many  of  the  abundant  or  important  species  impinged  at  SGS  were  either  not  as  abundant  at 
HCGS  at  similar  densities  or  were  noticeably  more  abundant  at  HCGS  than  at  SGS.  Species 
that  shared  similar  densities  included  blue  crab,  American  Eel  (Anguilla  rostrata),  Bay  Anchovy 
(. Anchoa  mitchilli),  and  Atlantic  Silverside  ( Menidia  menidia).  Total  density  of  impinged  fish  at 
both  SGS  and  HCGS  between  1986  and  1987  was  comparable  and  was  calculated  using  the 
number  of  a  given  species  collected  per  million  cubic  meters  of  intake  water  volume  sampled.

(f)  Includes  all  finfish  impinged,  not  just  those  listed  in  the  table. 


Differences  in  impinged  species  composition  between  SGS  and  HCGS  may  be  attributable  to 
the  different  physical  locations  of  the  intake  structures  of  the  two  existing  sites  (i.e.,  southwest 
for  the  SGS  cooling  water  intake  structure  versus  west  for  the  HCGS  service  water  intake 
structure)  and  differences  in  intake  screening  technology  and  screen  approach  velocities 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

The  comparison  of  the  SGS  1986-87  impingement  data  with  SGS  2003-10  impingement  data 
shows  shifts  in  specific  species  abundance.  Calculating  mean  density  impinged  per  volume  of 
water  corrects  for  the  difference  in  number  of  sampling  events  because  more  frequent  samples 
were  collected  between  2003  and  2010.  Interestingly,  the  total  abundance  of  blue  crab,  Bay 
Anchovy,  Summer  Flounder  ( Paralichthys  dentatus),  Oyster  Toadfish  ( Opsanus  tau),  and 
Hogchoker  ( Trinectes  maculatus)  diminished  by  a  factor  of  2  or  more  since  the  1986-87 
sampling  events.  However,  increases  in  Atlantic  Silverside,  White  Perch  ( Morone  americana), 
Striped  Bass  ( Morone  saxatilis),  Atlantic  Croaker  ( Micropogonias  undulatus),  American  Shad 
(. Alosa  sapidissima),  Channel  Catfish  {Ictalurus  punctatus),  Northern  Kingfish  ( Menticirrhus

saxatilis),  and  Gizzard  Shad  ( Dorosoma  cepedianum )  are  evident  since  the  1986-87  sampling. 
Of  note,  impingement  data  for  SGS  from  2008-10  (PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570; 
PSEG  201 1-TN2571),  were  also  examined  and  compared  with  the  2003-07  SGS  impingement 
data  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568; 
PSEG  2008-TN2569)  to  assess  any  recent  deviation  from  the  previous  2003-07  trend  (data  not 
shown  in  table).  Gizzard  Shad,  Northern  Kingfish,  Black  Drum  ( Pogonias  cromis),  and  Atlantic 
Menhaden  ( Brevoortia  tyrannus)  all  increased  by  a  factor  of  2  in  the  more  recent  sampling. 
However,  Blueback  Herring  ( Alosa  aestivalis ),  Atlantic  Croaker,  Butterfish  ( Peprilus  triacanthus), 
Channel  Catfish,  Scup  ( Stenotomus  chrysops),  and  Spotted  Hake  ( Urophycis  regia )  were  all 
reduced  by  a  factor  of  2  in  the  more  recent  sampling.  These  deviations  in  annual  averages  may 
represent  changes  to  environmental  conditions  at  the  larger  regional  scale  and  do  not  appear  to 
reflect  any  longer  term  trends  in  abundance. 

Impingement  mortality  was  not  reported  during  the  HCGS  impingement  sampling  in  1986  or 
1987  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572).  However,  sampling  at  SGS  between  1986 
and  1987  and  between  2003  and  2010  reported  between  97  percent  and  100  percent  live, 
undamaged  blue  crab  and  live  condition  for  greater  than  50  percent  of  the  finfish  impinged 
with  the  exception  of  White  Perch  and  Atlantic  Croaker  juveniles  between  1986  and  1987 
(VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572;  PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG

Historical  impingement  rates  for  the  aquatic  community  from  SGS  (2003-10)  and  HCGS  (1986- 
87)  were  used  to  estimate  potential  impingement  losses  associated  with  the  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006- 
TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010- 
TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ;  VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572).  HCGS  is  more  similar 
to  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  because  it  has  a  closed-cycle  cooling  system  design,  which 
differs  from  the  once-through  cooling  system  of  SGS.  SGS  withdraws  larger  volumes  of  water 
from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  with  a  faster  through-screen  velocity  (0.9  fps),  and  therefore, 
SGS  would  be  expected  to  impinge  more  fish  than  the  closed-cycle  cooling  systems  of  HCGS 
and  a  new  power  plant. 

PSEG  examined  the  most  recent  HCGS  impingement  data  from  1986  and  1987  with  same  year 
impingement  data  for  SGS  and  derived  a  correction  factor  by  dividing  the  HCGS  data  by  the 
SGS  data  to  allow  comparison  between  the  two  plants  and  normalize  the  differences  in  intake 
volume  and  velocity  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572).  Examination  of  1986-87 
density  impingement  rates  for  finfish  show  a  total  impingement  density  average  of 
2,095.4  organisms  per  million  cubic  meters  of  total  water  volume  for  HCGS  and  2,643.6 
organisms  per  million  cubic  meters  of  total  water  volume  for  SGS.  When  combining  both  finfish 
and  blue  crab  impingement  rates,  HCGS  has  a  total  impingement  density  average  of  4,545.5 
organisms  per  million  cubic  meters  of  total  water  volume  and  4,186.1  organisms  per  million 
cubic  meters  of  total  water  volume  for  SGS.  The  more  recent  impingement  rates  for  SGS 
between  2003  and  2010  report  a  finfish  impingement  rate  of  3,152.5  organisms  per  million  cubic 
meters  of  total  water  volume  and  a  combined  blue  crab  and  finfish  impingement  rate  of  3,842.9 
organisms  per  million  cubic  meters  of  total  water  volume.  Therefore,  a  correction  factor  may  not 
be  needed  to  assess  total  organism  impingement,  and  PSEG  used  a  conservative  approach  for

assessing  potential  impingement  rates  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  in  its  ER.  However,  for 
comparative  purposes,  PSEG  presented  in  its  ER  both  the  conservative  assumption  and  the 
correction  factor  for  estimating  potential  impingement  rates  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Sampled  total  finfish  density  was  moderately  lower  at  HCGS  relative  to  SGS  using  data  sets 
from  either  1986  to  1987  or  2003  to  2010,  possibly  because  of  the  lower  approach  velocities  to 
the  HCGS  screens.  The  only  commercially  important  invertebrate  vulnerable  to  substantial 
impingement  by  the  intake  structure  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  the  blue 
crab.  Blue  crab  densities  for  impingement  samples  at  SGS  were  690.4  per  million  cubic  meters 
of  total  water  volume  between  2003  and  2010  and  1 ,542.5  per  million  cubic  meters  of  total 
water  volume  in  1 986  to  1 987.  At  HCGS,  blue  crabs  were  impinged  at  a  mean  rate  of  2,450. 1 
per  million  cubic  meters  of  total  water  volume  in  1 986-87  (see  Table  5-3).  It  is  possible  that  the 
rate  of  impingement  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  for  blue  crab  may  be  less 
than  in  1986-87  because  there  was  a  significant  drop  in  impingement  abundance  of  blue  crab 
at  SGS  between  the  sampling  dates  in  the  1980s  and  the  average  of  8  years  of  more  recent 
sampling. 

The  applicant  estimated  impingement  rates  of  finfish  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  by  multiplying  the  more  recent  SGS  impingement  densities  by  a  correction  factor 
representing  the  ratio  of  the  total  finfish  impingement  density  at  HCGS  (1986-87)  to  that  of  SGS 
for  the  same  period.  Recent  examination  of  these  data  sets  and  impingement  rates  derives  the 
correction  factor  to  be  0.79  (2,095.4/2,643.6).  It  is  reasonable  to  use  the  historical  HCGS 
impingement  rate  correction  factor  for  the  estimate  of  impingement  rate  at  a  new  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  because  the  intake  design  velocity  for  a  new  plant  (less  than  0.5  fps)  is  more 
comparable  to  HCGS  than  to  SGS  (roughly  0.9  fps).  Thus,  the  estimated  total  impingement  rate 
of  finfish  due  to  operation  of  a  new  plant  is  2,490.5  per  million  cubic  meters  of  total  water 
volume  compared  to  the  more  recent  impingement  rate  of  3,152.5  per  million  cubic  meters  of 
total  water  volume  for  SGS.  White  Perch,  Atlantic  Croaker,  and  Weakfish  ( Cynoscion  regalis) 
are  expected  to  compose  the  majority  of  the  impingement  total.  The  proposed  maximum  rate  of 
water  withdrawal  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  equivalent  to  3.7  percent  of 
the  intake  flow  at  SGS  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Assuming  a  constant  withdrawal  of  78,196  gpm 
for  a  new  plant,  and  using  the  79  percent  correction  factor  for  finfish  impingement,  a  new  plant 
would  result  in  impingement  of  an  estimated  386,526  fish  annually.  Using  the  more 
conservative  assumption  with  no  correction  factor,  and  a  maximum  rate  of  water  withdrawal  for 
a  new  plant  of  3.7  percent  of  the  intake  flow  of  SGS,  about  489,148  fish  would  be  impinged 
annually  at  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

The  intake  structure  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  contain  traveling 
screens  to  collect  debris  and  fish.  Impinged  organic  debris  and  aquatic  organisms  would  be 
washed  from  the  traveling  screens  and  returned  to  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  Mixed  organic 
and  human-made  debris  (e.g.,  wood,  plastic)  collected  from  the  trash  racks  would  be  disposed 
of  offsite. 

Details  about  the  screen  design,  screen  wash,  and  fish  return  system  are  not  available,  but 
PSEG  has  stated  in  its  ER  that  the  screen  design  would  be  compliant  with  EPA  316(b)  Phase  I 
requirements  specified  in  40  CFR  125.84  (TN254),  similar  to  screens  at  HCGS,  and  would 
include  low-pressure  screen  washes  to  safely  remove  impinged  organisms  and  water-filled  fish

buckets  to  improve  the  survival  of  screen-washed  fish  and  shellfish  until  they  are  transported 
back  to  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  by  the  fish  return  system  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

In  terms  of  numbers,  the  estimated  conservative  impingement  of  most  fish  species  is  a  small 
percentage  of  the  commercial  and  recreational  harvests  of  these  species  in  Delaware  and  New 
Jersey,  as  described  in  Section  2.4.2.  Blue  crab,  Weakfish,  White  Perch,  and  Atlantic  Croaker 
potentially  would  have  the  highest  impingement  rates  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site.  However,  it  is  expected  that  a  large  portion  of  these  impinged  organisms  would  survive 
because  of  the  comparable  impingement  mortality  recorded  for  SGS  with  a  higher  through- 
screen  velocity  than  would  be  used  for  a  new  plant.  Based  on  the  planned  low  through-screen 
intake  velocity  and  the  use  of  closed-cycle  cooling,  the  review  team  concludes  that  impacts  from 
impingement  of  aquatic  organisms  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be 
minor. 

Entrainment 

Small,  passively  drifting,  or  weakly  swimming  aquatic  organisms  that  are  drawn  into  the  intake 
and  pass  through  the  openings  in  the  traveling  screens  and  through  a  closed-cycle  cooling 
system  are  conservatively  assessed  to  have  100  percent  mortality  (NRC  2000-TN614).  Some 
entrained  organisms  are  present  year-round,  such  as  phytoplankton  and  many  types  of 
zooplankton.  These  diverse  plant  and  animal  species  (often  referred  to  as  holoplankton)  are 
abundant  throughout  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  have  short  generation  times,  so  they  can 
rapidly  replace  the  losses  due  to  entrainment,  heat  shock,  and  other  stresses.  Other  entrained 
organisms,  such  as  the  larval  stages  offish,  crabs,  and  other  bottom-dwelling  crustaceans,  are 
present  only  seasonally  near  the  proposed  intake  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site.  However,  many  of  these  seasonally  planktonic  organisms  (collectively  referred  to  as 
meroplankton)  have  longer  life  spans  and  generation  times,  so  losses  from  cooling  system 
effects  are  not  as  readily  replaced. 

The  history  of  entrainment  sampling  at  SGS  and  analyses  of  entrainment  losses  are  described 
in  the  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants, 
Supplement  45  Regarding  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  and  Salem  Nuclear  Generating 
Station,  Units  1  and  2,  Final  Report  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ).  Most  recently,  entrainment  offish 
eggs,  larvae,  juveniles,  and  adults  in  the  SGS  cooling  water  system  was  studied  between  2003 
and  2010  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007- 
TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011- 
TN257 1 ).  Over  the  8-year  period,  between  25  and  38  species  were  identified  each  year  among 
the  entrained  fish  (eggs,  larvae,  small  juveniles,  and  adults).  Of  these,  92  percent  of  the 
entrainment  samples  were  composed  of  two  species:  Bay  Anchovy  (75.3  percent)  and  Naked 
Goby  ( Gobiosoma  bosc)  (16.7  percent).  Additional  species  that  composed  over  98  percent  of 
all  entrained  species  included  Atlantic  Croaker  (3.5  percent),  Striped  Bass  (1.4  percent), 
Weakfish  (0.8  percent),  Atlantic  Menhaden  (0.4  percent),  and  Atlantic  Silverside  (0.4  percent). 
Bay  Anchovy  was  the  most  abundantly  entrained  species  for  the  egg  (99.7  percent)  and  adult 
(57  percent)  life  stages,  while  Naked  Goby  was  the  most  abundantly  entrained  larval  species 
(49  percent),  and  Atlantic  Croaker  was  the  most  abundantly  entrained  juvenile  species 
(56  percent)  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007- 
TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011-

TN257 1 ).  Seasonal  vulnerability  to  entrainment  is  species-specific.  For  example,  eggs,  larvae, 
and  juveniles  of  Bay  Anchovy  were  most  numerous  in  entrainment  samples  in  summer  months 
(June  and  July),  whereas  Atlantic  Croaker  juveniles  were  most  abundant  in  the  fall  (October  and 
November)  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007- 
TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569:  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011- 
TN257 1 ).  In  general,  the  densities  of  entrained  individuals  for  most  fish  species  were  greatest 
in  the  spring  and/or  summer,  corresponding  to  the  spawning  periods  for  these  species.  Total 
densities  of  all  fish  life  stages  in  the  entrainment  samples  ranged  from  54.0/100  m3  (2003)  to 
264.2/100  m3  (2007)  and  averaged  125.0/100  m3  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

PSEG  applied  estimated  annual  entrainment  rates  from  SGS  directly  to  calculate  entrainment 
rates  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  entrainment  rates  at  SGS  were 
applied  to  a  new  plant  without  a  correction  factor  because  entrained  organisms  are  planktonic. 
Entrainment  rates  are  a  function  of  water  withdrawal  rates  and  are  not  influenced  by 
through-screen  velocities.  Entrainment  of  holoplankton  and  meroplankton  would  be  much 
smaller  for  a  new  plant  than  for  SGS  because  of  the  smaller  volume  of  water  withdrawn  by  the 
closed-cycle  system  at  a  new  plant.  Based  on  the  small  volume  of  water  withdrawn  for  the 
closed-cycle  cooling  water  system  at  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  the  annual  entrainment  of 
organisms  during  operation  of  the  intake  system  is  expected  to  be  minor  and  average  less  than 
125  organisms  per  100  m3.  The  species  most  likely  to  be  entrained  is  the  Bay  Anchovy,  a 
highly  abundant  species  in  the  area  with  females  spawning  every  4  to  5  days  over  the  spawning 
season  (Zastrow  et  al.  1991-TN2670). 

Cooling  Water  Discharge  Impacts 

Blowdown  from  the  cooling  towers.  SWS.  and  other  aqueous  waste  streams  at  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  combined  and  discharged  to  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  at  an  average  flow  rate  of  50,51 6  gpm  (113  cfs)  and  a  velocity  of  9.2  fps.  as  described 
in  Table  3-1.  The  submerged  48-in. -diameter  discharge  pipe  would  be  located  8,000  ft  north  of 
the  SGS  discharge  pipe  and  2.500  ft  north  of  the  HCGS  discharge  pipe.  The  outlet  of  the 
discharge  pipe  would  be  100  ft  from  the  shoreline,  12  ft  below  mean  lower  low  water  and  3  ft 
above  the  river  bottom  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Relative  to  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  the 
discharged  water  would  have  an  elevated  temperature  and  increased  concentration  of  both 
natural  chemical  constituents  and  chemical  contaminants.  Because  of  the  tidal  nature  of  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  in  this  area,  the  direction  of  the  thermal  discharge  plume  would  vary 
with  the  tidal  cycle. 

Thermal  Impacts 

Potential  thermal  impacts  on  aquatic  organisms  could  include  heat  stress,  cold  shock,  and  the 
creation  of  favorable  conditions  for  invasive  species. 

As  described  in  Section  5. 2. 3.1.  the  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  where  discharge 
would  occur  is  located  in  Zone  5  between  Delaware  RM  78.8  and  RM  48.2.  The  DRBC 
temperature-related  standards  for  Zone  5  require  that  the  discharge-induced  water  temperature 
increases  above  the  ambient  water  temperature  in  the  river  outside  the  permitted  HDA  may  not 
increase  by  more  than  4°F  (2.2°C)  from  September  through  May  and  by  1 ,5=F  (0.8CC)  from

NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


June  through  August,  with  a  year-round  maximum  water  temperature  of  86°F  (30°C)  (18  CFR 
Part  410-TN3235;  DRBC  2011-TN2371)  (Figure  5-2).  Recent  trawling  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  zone  in  the  vicinity  of  SGS  and  HCGS  between  2003  and  2010  has  not  identified 
significant  shifts  in  species  abundances  near  the  SGS  and  HCGS  discharge  areas  compared  to 
adjacent  zones  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007- 
TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011- 
TN2571 ).  The  volume  of  the  thermal  discharge  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  (50,516  gpm)  is  only  2.4  percent  of  that  from  SGS  (about  2,100,000  gpm  circulated  through 
the  once-through  cooling  system)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  As  discussed  in  Section  5. 2. 3.1,  the 
thermal  plume  of  the  discharge  (defined  by  the  1 ,5°F  temperature  excess)  from  a  new  plant 
would  have  a  maximum  extent  of  about  700  ft  into  the  river  from  the  discharge  location,  about 
300  ft  upstream  from  the  discharge,  and  about  500  ft  downstream  from  the  discharge.  This 
plume  would  be  contained  completely  within  the  existing  SGS  HDA  and  would  not  be  expected 
to  impede  fish  migration.  During  flood  tide  conditions,  when  the  median  water  temperature 
exceeds  79.4°F,  the  review  team  estimated  that  a  portion  of  the  thermal  plume  would  exceed 
86°F  due  to  the  cumulative  effects  from  SGS,  HCGS,  and  a  new  plant  (3.6°F,  1.5°F,  1.5°F, 
respectively;  see  Figure  5-2).  However,  the  combination  of  high-velocity  discharge,  turbulence 
in  the  discharge  outlet  area,  and  rapid  mixing  of  the  discharge  effluent  would  limit  the  size  of  the 
thermal  plume. 

A  factor  related  to  thermal  discharges  that  may  affect  aquatic  biota  is  cold  shock.  Cold  shock 
occurs  when  aquatic  organisms  that  have  been  acclimated  to  warm  water  are  exposed  to  a 
sudden  temperature  decrease.  This  sometimes  occurs  when  single-unit  power  plants  shut 
down  suddenly  in  winter  or  when  an  unseasonable  cold  weather  event  occurs.  Cold  shock  is 
less  likely  to  occur  at  a  multiple-unit  plant  because  the  temperature  decrease  from  shutting 
down  one  unit  is  moderated  by  the  heated  discharge  from  the  units  that  continue  to  operate. 
Based  on  the  foregoing,  any  thermal  impacts  on  the  fish  populations  due  to  cold  shock  would  be 
expected  to  be  minor. 

Chemical  Impacts 

As  described  in  Section  3.2.1 .2,  the  cycles  of  concentration  increase  the  concentration  of  TDS 
and  minerals  in  the  blowdown.  In  addition,  the  blowdown  would  contain  chemical  additives  such 
as  biocides  and  pH-adjusting  chemicals  to  ensure  proper  functioning  of  the  cooling  towers. 
Predicted  concentrations  of  dissolved  chemical  constituents  in  the  discharges  from  the  cooling 
water  and  other  systems  are  expected  to  be  compliant  and  controlled  by  the  terms  of  the 
NJPDES  permit  that  would  be  issued  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Physical  Impacts 

Because  of  the  increased  temperature  and  chemical  content  of  the  discharged  water  compared 
to  ambient  conditions,  the  plume  is  expected  to  be  negatively  buoyant  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
Due  to  the  discharge’s  high  velocity  of  9.2  fps,  there  would  be  rapid  mixing  with  tidal  currents 
upstream  and  downstream,  with  some  potential  for  scouring  occurring  at  the  point  of  discharge. 
To  minimize  the  scouring  potential,  PSEG  would  place  riprap  or  other  engineered  features  near 
the  end  of  the  discharge  pipe  and  reduce  the  possible  interactions  of  the  discharge  plume  with 
bottom  habitats  and  bottom-dwelling  aquatic  organisms  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Use  of  the  HCGS  barge  slip  and  the  new  barge  storage  and  unloading  facility  are  expected  to 
be  infrequent  during  operation.  However,  propeller  wash  may  cause  localized  scouring  and 
sedimentation  within  the  barge  slip.  Because  this  area  would  be  previously  disturbed  during  site 
preparation  and  used  during  transport  of  building  materials,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  temporary 
habitat  disruption  would  have  adverse  effects  on  the  aquatic  communities  in  the  area 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Adjacent,  undisturbed  habitat  is  available,  and  mobile  aquatic 
organisms  would  likely  avoid  the  barge  slip  area. 

Dredging  may  be  required  to  maintain  use  of  the  HCGS  barge  slip  and  the  intake  channel  as 
well  as  barge  storage  and  unloading  facility  during  operation.  Any  effects  to  water  quality,  such 
as  siltation,  during  these  infrequent  periods  would  be  temporary  and  would  be  managed  through 
the  use  of  Federal  and  State  permitting  requirements  for  use  of  BMPs,  and  dredged  material 
disposal  would  be  in  approved  upland  disposal  areas  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Mobile  organisms 
in  the  area  would  avoid  activities  involved  in  dredging  and  could  use  adjacent,  undisturbed 
habitat  during  the  temporary  disruption. 

Based  on  the  foregoing,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  thermal,  chemical,  and  physical 
impacts  of  discharge  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  on  habitat  and  aquatic 
biota  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  would  be  minor. 

Stormwater  Management 

As  described  in  5.2.3. 1 ,  PSEG  would  develop  an  SWPPP  to  minimize  stormwater  drainage 
effects  to  nearby  surface  waters.  The  SWPPP  would  be  required  to  meet  NJPDES  stormwater 
discharge  requirements.

Maintenance  of  the  proposed  causeway  could  result  in  soil  disturbance  (erosion,  suspended 
sediments,  sedimentation)  and  the  addition  of  road  chemicals  to  offsite  water  bodies.  The 
resulting  water-quality  degradation  could  in  turn  affect  aquatic  biota. 

Causeway  maintenance  activities  could  temporarily  degrade  surface-water  quality  and  aquatic 
habitats.  PSEG  expects  to  minimize  the  impacts  of  such  activities  by  using  temporary  work 
mats  and  other  impact-reducing  measures.  The  presence  of  the  causeway  would  introduce 
permanent  shading  patterns  for  the  marsh  creeks  crossed  by  the  causeway,  which  would 
reduce  sunlight  required  for  primary  productivity.  While  primary  productivity  may  be  reduced  for 
these  areas,  abundant  adjacent  marsh  creek  resources  would  be  expected  to  remain 
unaffected.  Compliance  with  Federal  and  State  permits  is  expected  to  prevent  degradation  of 
water  quality  and  aquatic  resources  through  use  of  required  BMPs  to  minimize  impacts 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

5. 3. 2. 3  important  A  qua  tic  Species  and  Habitats 

This  section  describes  the  potential  impacts  to  important  aquatic  species  and  habitats  from 
operation  and  maintenance  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Important  species 
include  Federally  threatened,  endangered,  or  candidate  species;  those  species  listed  by  the 
States  of  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  as  threatened,  endangered,  or  of  special  concern;

commercially  or  recreationally  important  fish  and  shellfish;  or  species  that  affect  the  well-being 
of  the  above  species  or  are  critical  to  the  structure  and  function  of  a  valuable  ecological  system. 
Important  aquatic  species  and  aquatic  habitats  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  are  described  in 
Section  2. 4. 2. 3. 

Important  Recreational  or  Commercial  Aquatic  Species 

In  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site,  21  species  of  finfish  have  been 
identified  as  being  commercially  or  recreationally  important  in  New  Jersey  or  Delaware  (see 
Section  2. 4. 2. 3).  In  addition  to  these  fish  species,  five  species  of  invertebrates,  which  occur  in 
the  region,  are  commercially  harvested  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware,  including  the  blue  crab, 
eastern  oyster  ( Crassostrea  virginica ),  knobbed  whelk  ( Busycon  carica),  channeled  whelk 
( Busycotypus  canaliculatus),  and  northern  quahog  clam  ( Mercenaria  mercenaria)  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  A  sixth  invertebrate  species,  the  horseshoe  crab  ( Limulus  polyphemus),  is  harvested 
in  Delaware.  Since  2008  there  has  been  a  moratorium  in  place  on  the  harvest  of  horseshoe 
crabs  in  New  Jersey  (ASMFC  2014-TN351 1 ). 

Previous  impingement  and  entrainment  studies  at  SGS  and  HCGS  commonly  collected  the 
following  commercially  or  recreationally  important  species:  Weakfish,  Atlantic  Croaker,  White 
Perch,  Striped  Bass,  and  blue  crab.  Although  these  species  were  observed  in  these  studies, 
trawling  and  seining  studies  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  show  that  these  populations 
experience  annual  changes  in  relative  density  throughout  the  watershed,  yet  remain  abundant 
(see  Section  2.4.2;  PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG 
2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011- 
TN2571 ). 

Trawl  surveys  in  the  PSEG  sampling  zone  near  SGS,  HCGS,  and  the  PSEG  Site  show  reduced 
numbers  of  commercially  and  recreationally  important  species  when  compared  to  other  regions 
in  the  estuary  because  most  of  these  species  prefer  marine  habitats  (PSEG  2004-TN2565; 
PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG 
2009-TN2513;  PSEG  201 0-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571).  Although  eastern  oyster  beds  are 
present  within  6  mi  of  Artificial  Island  to  the  south,  these  oyster  beds  are  not  likely  to  be  affected 
by  intake  or  discharge  operations.  Therefore,  cooling  water  intake  and  discharge  operation  at  a 
new  plant  is  not  expected  to  have  noticeable  effects  on  commercially  and  recreationally 
important  species  that  occur  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

Because  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  a  closed-cycle  cooling 
system,  the  amounts  of  water  withdrawn  and  discharged  would  be  a  small  fraction  of  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  flow.  In  addition,  traveling  intake  screens  with  a  low  through-mesh 
velocity  of  less  than  0.5  fps  would  permit  the  survival  of  a  portion  of  the  impinged  aquatic 
organisms  that  are  returned  to  the  river  (Section  5.3.2. 1).  The  effects  of  operation  of  a  new 
plant’s  cooling  system  on  important  aquatic  species  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  are  expected 
to  be  minor. 

Non-native  and  Nuisance  Species 

Invasive  species  that  may  occur  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  include  the  Asian  shore  crab 
( Hemigrapsus  sanguineus ),  Chinese  mitten  crab  {Eriocheir  sinensis),  the  Northern  Snakehead

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


( Channa  argus),  and  the  Flathead  Catfish  ( Pylodictis  olivaris).  While  each  of  these  species  has 
been  documented  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site,  there  are  no  reports  that  would  indicate  they 
have  increased  in  abundance  and  would  pose  a  risk  to  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant, 
nor  would  operation  of  a  new  plant  be  expected  to  increase  occurrences  of  these  species. 

Aquatic  Threatened  or  Endangered  Species 

As  part  of  their  responsibilities  under  section  7  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act  of  1973  (16  USC 
1531  et  seq.  -TN 1 010),  the  review  team  prepared  a  BA  documenting  potential  impacts  on 
Federally  listed  threatened  or  endangered  aquatic  species  as  a  result  of  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  loggerhead  sea  turtle  ( Caretta  caretta ),  Atlantic 
green  sea  turtle  ( Chelonia  mydas),  Kemp’s  ridley  sea  turtle  ( Lepidochelys  kempii),  Atlantic 
Sturgeon  (Acipenser  oxyrinchus  oxyrinchus),  and  Shortnose  Sturgeon  [A.  brevirostrum)  are 
Federally  listed  threatened  or  endangered  species  known  to  occur  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG 
Site  (NMFS  2010-TN2171;  NMFS  2013-TN2804).  A  BA  is  provided  in  Appendix  F,  and  the 
findings  and  determinations  are  summarized  in  this  section.  No  critical  habitat  has  been 
designated  for  species  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  (NMFS)  in 
the  action  area  (NMFS  2014-TN4238).  The  sea  turtles  and  sturgeon  do  not  nest  or  reproduce 
in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  intake  or  discharge.  Therefore,  the  impact  of  intake  or  discharge 
operations  on  newly  hatched  turtles  or  eggs  and  fry  of  sturgeon  would  be  insignificant.  Because 
the  flow  requirements  under  316(b)  require  through-screen  velocities  of  0.5  fps  or  less,  any 
juvenile,  subadult,  and  adult  healthy  sea  turtles  or  sturgeon  that  enter  the  intake  area  during 
operation  would  be  able  to  swim  away.  However,  injured  or  moribund  species  may  become 
entrapped  on  the  intake  trash  bars  or  traveling  screens.  There  have  been  no  documented 
protected  species  found  on  the  intake  trash  bars  or  traveling  screens  for  HCGS,  which  uses 
intake  and  discharge  technologies  (closed-cycle  cooling)  similar  to  what  is  being  proposed  for  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  For  the  once-through  cooling  intakes  at  SGS,  live 
and  dead  loggerhead,  Atlantic  green,  and  Kemp’s  ridley  sea  turtles,  as  well  as  Shortnose  and 
Atlantic  Sturgeon,  have  been  collected  from  the  intake  bays  or  trash  racks  and  documented 
extensively  as  part  of  the  operation  parameters  for  SGS  (see  Section  2. 4. 2. 3).  Discharge  of 
effluent  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  not  significantly  affect  Federally  or  State-listed 
species  due  to  rapid  mixing  under  tidal  influence  in  the  immediate  Delaware  River  Estuary 
discharge  area.  Dredging  or  maintenance  activities  for  the  HCGS  barge  slip,  intake  channel, 
barge  storage  and  unloading  facility,  haul  road  bulkhead,  and  causeway  are  expected  to  create 
temporary,  localized  disturbances  that  could  be  minimized  and/or  avoided  using  BMPs  required 
to  minimize  impacts  to  water  quality  under  Federal  and  State  permits.  This  may  also  be 
accomplished  through  permit  conditions  in  the  State  and  Federal  permits,  and  as  such  would 
not  adversely  affect  any  listed  species.  Therefore,  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  may  affect,  but  is  not  likely  to  adversely  affect,  juvenile,  subadult,  and  adult  sea 
turtles  or  sturgeon.  The  review  team  received  comments  from  the  NMFS  regarding  the 
uncertainty  of  operations  effects  for  the  ESP  permitting  process  (NMFS  2014-TN4203).  The 
review  team  and  NMFS  discussed  that  PSEG  would  need  to  apply  for  an  operating  license  or  a 
combined  construction  permit  and  operating  license  (COL)  in  the  future  and  that  NRC  would 
need  to  assess  operations  effects  in  another  BA  with  specific  operating  conditions  that  are  not 
currently  available  for  the  ESP.  NMFS  agreed  that  assessment  of  operations  effects  and 
addressing  operations  comments  would  not  be  needed  for  consultation  for  the  ESP  (NRC  2015- 
TN4209).

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Essential  Fish  Habitat 

The  Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and  Management  Act  (16  USC  1801  et  seq.  - 
TN1061)  defines  adverse  effects  to  essential  fish  habitat  (EFH)  as  including  “direct  or  indirect 
physical,  chemical,  or  biological  alterations  of  the  waters  or  substrate  and  loss  of,  or  injury  to, 
benthic  organisms,  prey  species,  and  their  habitat .  .  .  A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  would  affect  EFH  primarily  through  operation  of  the  cooling  water  system.  Water 
withdrawn  for  cooling  is  no  longer  available  as  fish  habitat,  and  fish  and  their  food  can  be  lost 
due  to  impingement  and  entrainment.  Blowdown  water  returned  to  the  Delaware  River  Estuary 
as  heated  effluent  would  change  the  natural  thermal  and  water  current  regimes  in  fish  habitat. 
Consequently,  the  proposed  action  has  the  potential  to  alter  at  least  some  aspects  of  EFH.  The 
EFH  assessment  in  Appendix  F  contains  a  detailed  discussion  of  potential  impacts  on  EFH. 

5. 3.2.4  A  qua  tic  Monitoring  During  Operation 

The  NJPDES  permit  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  monitoring 
requirements  related  to  thermal  and  chemical  constituents  of  waste  streams.  Discharge 
monitoring  of  regulated  chemical  constituents  would  be  part  of  ongoing  operations  of  a  new 
plant  to  ensure  compliance  with  NJPDES  permit  limits.  Monitoring  of  intake  effects  (entrainment 
and  impingement)  is  required  as  a  condition  of  the  NJPDES  permit  and  would  be  similar  to  the 
2  years  of  initial  monitoring  required  for  HCGS,  which  also  employs  a  closed-cycle  cooling 
system.  The  NJPDES  permit  is  required  for  the  entire  duration  of  site  operation  and  must  be 
renewed  every  5  years,  with  provisions  for  updating  monitoring  programs  and  parameters,  as 
necessary  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

5. 3. 2. 5  Summary  of  Operational  Impacts  to  Aquatic  Resources 

Operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  increase  the  entrainment  and 
impingement  of  aquatic  organisms  and  the  discharge  of  heat  and  chemical  contaminants  to  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  that  are  already  occurring  as  a  result  of  the  operation  of  SGS  and 
HCGS.  However,  because  a  new  plant  would  use  a  closed-cycle  cooling  system  and  a  fish 
screening  system  designed  to  increase  the  survival  of  impinged  fish,  these  impacts  are 
expected  to  have  no  more  than  minor  impacts  to  the  aquatic  resources  in  the  area.  Other 
impacts  from  operational  activities,  such  as  maintenance  dredging  and  causeway  maintenance, 
are  expected  to  be  minor.  Based  on  this  review,  the  review  team  has  determined  the  impacts 
resulting  from  operational  and  maintenance  activities  would  be  SMALL. 

5.4  Socioeconomic  Impacts 

Operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  could  affect  individual  communities, 
the  surrounding  region,  and  minority  and  low-income  populations.  This  section  assesses  the 
impacts  of  operations-related  activities  and  the  associated  workforce  on  the  region.  The  review 
team  reviewed  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  and  verified  the  data  sources  used  in  its 
application  by  examining  cited  references  and  independently  confirming  data  in  discussions  with 
community  members  and  public  officials  (NRC  2012-TN2499).  To  verify  data  in  the  ER,  the 
review  team  requested  clarifications  and  additional  information  from  PSEG  as  needed.  Unless 
otherwise  specified  in  the  sections  below,  the  review  team  has  drawn  upon  verified  data  from 
PSEG  (PSEG  2012-TN2450;  PSEG  2012-TN2370).  Where  the  review  team  used  different

analytical  methods  or  additional  information  for  its  own  analysis,  the  EIS  includes  explanatory 
discussions  and  citations  for  the  additional  sources. 

Although  the  review  team  considered  the  entire  region  within  a  50-mi  radius  of  the  PSEG  Site 
when  assessing  socioeconomic  impacts,  because  of  expected  commuter  patterns,  the 
distribution  of  residential  communities  in  the  area,  and  the  likely  socioeconomic  impacts,  the 
review  team  identified  a  primary  economic  impact  area  composed  of  the  four  counties  nearest 
to  the  site — Salem,  Cumberland,  and  Gloucester  Counties  in  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle 
County  in  Delaware — as  the  area  with  the  greatest  potential  for  economic  impacts. 

Section  5.4.1  presents  a  summary  of  the  physical  impacts  of  the  project.  Section  5.4.2  provides 
a  description  of  the  demographic  impacts.  Section  5.4.3  describes  the  economic  impacts, 
including  impacts  on  the  local  and  state  economy  and  tax  revenues.  Section  5.4.4  describes 
the  impacts  on  infrastructure  and  community  services.  Section  5.4.5  summarizes  the 
socioeconomic  impacts  of  operations  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

5.4.1  Physical  Impacts 

Operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  cause  physical  impacts  to  nearby  communities,  including 
noise,  odors,  exhausts,  thermal  emissions,  and  visual  intrusions.  The  review  team  expects 
some  of  these  impacts  would  be  mitigated  by  compliance  with  all  applicable  Federal,  State,  and 
local  environmental  regulations  and  site-specific  permit  conditions.  This  section  addresses 
potential  physical  impacts  that  may  affect  people,  buildings,  and  roads. 

5. 4. 7. 7  Workers  and  the  Local  Public 

This  section  discusses  potential  effects  of  air  emissions  and  noise  on  workers,  nearby  residents, 
and  nearby  users  of  recreational  facilities.  The  PSEG  Site  is  located  adjacent  to  the  existing 
HCGS  and  SGS,  Units  1  and  2,  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New 
Jersey.  The  site  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  on  the  east  bank  of  the 
Delaware  River,  about  15  mi  south  of  the  Delaware  Memorial  Bridge,  18  mi  south  of  Wilmington, 
Delaware,  30  mi  southwest  of  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania,  and  7.5  mi  southwest  of  Salem,  New 
Jersey. 

The  nearest  residences  to  the  PSEG  Site  are  located  about  2.8  mi  to  the  west  in  New  Castle 
County,  Delaware,  and  about  3.4  mi  to  the  east-northeast  in  the  Hancock’s  Bridge  community 
of  Salem  County,  New  Jersey  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  closest  recreational  areas  are  the 
Augustine  Beach  Access  Area  and  Augustine  Wildlife  Area,  which  are  approximately  3.1  and 
3.6  mi,  respectively,  across  the  Delaware  River  from  the  PSEG  Site.  Because  of  distance  and 
intervening  foliage,  residents  and  visitors  to  recreational  areas  would  experience  minimal 
impacts. 

All  activities  related  to  operation  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  occur  within  the  site  boundary  and 
would  be  performed  in  compliance  with  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  (OSHA) 
standards,  BMPs,  and  other  applicable  regulatory  and  permit  requirements. 

Because  of  the  close  proximity  of  workers  to  the  sources  of  operations-related  physical  impacts, 
onsite  workers  involved  in  operational  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  experience  the  most

NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


direct  exposure  to  physical  impacts,  followed  by  operational  workers  at  the  adjacent  HCGS  and 
SGS.  Excessive  noise  is  expected  inside  some  buildings,  so  workers  would  wear  personal 
protective  equipment.  Auxiliary  boilers,  cooling  towers,  emergency  diesel  generators,  and/or 
combustion  engines  would  be  required  to  meet  workplace  and  environmental  standards  before 
start-up.  The  PSEG  Site  would  comply  with  OSHA  standards  for  onsite  exposure  to  noise, 
vapors,  dusts,  and  other  air  contaminants  for  workers.  Operations  workers  also  would  receive 
safety  training.  Emergency  first  aid  care  would  be  available,  and  regular  health  and  safety 
monitoring  would  be  conducted  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Consequently,  the  review  team 
determined  the  physical  impacts  to  onsite  workers  would  also  be  minimal. 

5. 4. 1.2  Noise 

The  main  sources  of  noise  during  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  from  the  switchyard, 
transformers,  and  cooling  towers.  Fan-assisted  natural  draft  cooling  towers  (NDCTs)  are  the 
bounding  noise  element  with  60  dBA  at  1,000  ft.  At  10,000  ft,  the  noise  level  would  be  41  dBA. 
New  Jersey  provides  regulatory  limits  for  continuous  noise  sources.  During  the  day,  New 
Jersey  has  a  65-dBA  limit  at  the  property  line  of  industrial  facilities.  New  Jersey  also  has  65- 
dBA  limits  at  residential  property  lines  during  the  day  and  50-dBA  nighttime  limits.  Delaware 
has  similar  regulatory  limits  of  65  dBA  at  residential  property  lines  and  55-dBA  nighttime  limits. 
The  closest  residences  are  1 4,700  ft  west  and  1 5,900  ft  east  of  the  site.  The  closest 
recreational  areas  are  even  farther  than  the  residential  areas  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Because 
of  these  distances  and  regulatory  limits,  the  review  team  does  not  expect  residents  of  the  area 
to  experience  impacts  in  the  form  of  noise  during  operations.  Projected  noise  impacts  from 
operation  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  discussed  in  further  detail  in  Section  5.8.2. 

5.4. 1.3  Air  Quality 

The  main  sources  for  emissions  from  plant  operation  are  cooling  towers,  auxiliary  boilers  for 
plant  heating  and  startup,  engine-driven  emergency  equipment,  and  diesel  generators  and/or 
combustion  turbines.  Cooling  tower  emissions  are  discussed  separately  in  Section  5.7.  The 
bounding  PPE  assumptions  are  for  six  backup  diesel  generators.  Emissions  sources  discussed 
above  would  be  small,  would  be  used  infrequently  or  mostly  during  the  winter  months  (except 
the  cooling  tower),  and  would  require  permits  from  NJDEP.  Therefore,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  physical  impacts  on  air  quality  would  be  minimal.  Projected  air  emissions  and 
impacts  on  air  quality  from  operation  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  discussed  in  further  detail  in 
Section  5.7. 

5.4. 1.4  Buildings 

Activities  associated  with  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  affect  offsite  buildings  because 
of  distance  and  intervening  terrain.  Onsite  buildings  are  designed  to  withstand  any  impact  from 
operational  activities.  Consequently,  the  review  team  determines  the  operations  impacts  on 
onsite  and  offsite  buildings  would  be  minimal. 

5. 4. 1.5  Transportation 

This  EIS  assesses  the  impact  of  workers  commuting  to  and  from  the  PSEG  Site  from  three 
perspectives:  socioeconomic  impacts  from  congestion  and  reductions  in  levels  of  service

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


(LOS),  air-quality  impacts  resulting  from  the  emissions  from  vehicles,  and  the  potential  health 
impacts  caused  by  traffic-related  accidents.  Only  the  physical  impacts  are  addressed  here. 
Section  2. 5. 2. 3  describes  the  local  transportation  network  around  the  PSEG  Site,  and 
Figure  2-23  depicts  the  road  and  highway  system  in  the  economic  impact  area.  Section  4. 4. 1.3 
discusses  the  building  impacts  on  roads  in  the  economic  impact  area.  Section  5.4.4. 1 
addresses  traffic  impacts.  Air-quality  impacts  from  vehicle  emissions  are  addressed  in 
Section  5.7,  and  human  health  impacts  are  addressed  in  Section  5.8. 

Roads 

Use  of  area  roadways  by  commuting  workers  could  contribute  to  physical  deterioration  of 
roadway  surfaces.  However,  some  or  all  of  the  mitigation  measures  incorporated  during  the 
building  phase  would  remain  in  place  during  operations  (see  Section  4. 4. 1.3).  Given  the  much 
smaller  volume  of  traffic  on  the  roads  during  operations  compared  to  during  building,  the  review 
team  determines  that  the  overall  impacts  on  road  quality  would  be  less  than  the  impacts  on  road 
quality  from  building  activities.  Therefore,  the  operations-related  impacts  on  road  quality  would 
be  minimal. 

Water 

As  discussed  in  Section  2. 5. 2. 3,  there  is  an  existing  barge  facility  at  the  HCGS  site.  To  support 
delivery  of  large  components  and  equipment  for  building,  PSEG  indicated  that  the  existing 
barge  facility  at  HCGS  would  need  to  be  modified,  and  a  parallel  barge  facility  would  need  to  be 
constructed.  Both  would  be  built  to  regulatory  requirements.  The  barge  slips  and  the  expected 
barge  deliveries  are  expected  to  have  a  negligible  impact  on  river  traffic  on  the  Delaware  River. 

Rail 

There  are  no  railroads  within  about  7  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ).  PSEG  has  not 
indicated  it  would  extend  a  rail  line  to  the  site.  The  review  team  expects  no  impacts  to  rail  lines 
in  the  area. 

5.4. 1.6  Aesthetics 

Similar  to  the  discussion  in  Section  4.4.1 .4,  the  completed  PSEG  Site  would  be  visible  primarily 
to  onsite  workers.  Aesthetic  impacts  to  offsite  areas  would  occur  mainly  from  the  introduction  of 
large  new  elements  into  the  visual  environment,  including  cooling  towers,  reactor  domes,  and 
an  elevated  causeway. 

A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  further  contribute  to  the  industrial  character 
of  the  existing  PSEG  property,  which  also  includes  HCGS  and  SGS.  The  principal  visual 
features  added  by  a  new  plant  would  be  cooling  towers  (up  to  590  ft  tall)  and  their  associated 
plumes,  reactor  buildings,  and  the  elevated  causeway.  Under  Federal  Aviation  Administration 
regulations,  the  cooling  towers  would  be  appropriately  marked  with  lighting,  making  them  visible 
during  nighttime  hours.  Figure  5-4  and  Figure  5-5  depict  how  the  developed  PSEG  Site  would 
appear  from  several  sensitive  locations  during  daylight.  PSEG  modified  these  photographs  by 
adding  duplicated  images  of  the  existing  HCGS  facilities  to  simulate  the  appearance  of  potential 
new  facilities  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2012-TN1489).

Figure  5-4  reflects  how  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  appear  from  two  recreational  areas  in 
New  Castle  County,  Delaware.  Views  from  nearby  residential  areas  along  the  Delaware  shore 
would  be  similar.  Delaware  County  officials  indicated  that  residents  of  Delaware  would  notice 
the  new  construction  but  would  become  accustomed  to  the  viewshed  once  the  project  is 
finished  (NRC  2012-TN2499).  Figure  5-5  depicts  how  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  might 
appear  from  the  Hancock’s  Bridge  community  and  from  the  viewing  platform  along  Money 
Island  Road,  both  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey. 


The  additional  structures  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  clearly  visible  from  both  of  these  locations. 
The  elevated  causeway  would  be  a  dominant  feature  in  the  view  from  the  Money  Island  Road

viewing  platform  and  likely  in  the  immediately  adjacent  Abbotts  Meadow  WMA,  which  receives 
recreational  use  for  hunting  and  bird  watching. 

The  height  of  the  plumes  from  the  NDCTs  would  depend  on  weather  conditions  and  winds.  The 
median  plume  height  for  the  cooling  tower  would  be  1 ,574  ft  above  ground  level  and  would  be 
higher  during  the  winter  months  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  plume  would  look  similar  to  that  of 
the  HCGS  cooling  tower. 

Although  a  new  plant  and  causeway  would  be  in  keeping  with  the  industrial  character  of  the 
existing  PSEG  property,  the  increased  intensity  of  the  visual  presence  of  structures  on  the 
PSEG  Site  as  well  as  the  introduction  of  the  elevated  causeway  as  a  dominant  visual  element  in 
a  sensitive  recreational  location  would  constitute  a  noticeable,  but  not  destabilizing,  impact. 

This  impact  would  be  due  to  the  essential  character  of  the  new  structures  and  would  not  be 
amenable  to  mitigation  measures. 

5. 4. 1.7  Summary  of  Physical  Impacts 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  evaluation  and 
outreach,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  physical  impacts  of  operations-related  activities  on 
workers  and  the  local  public,  buildings,  and  transportation  would  be  SMALL,  and  no  mitigation 
beyond  that  proposed  by  PSEG  would  be  warranted.  However,  the  addition  of  new  cooling 
towers  and  new  reactor  domes  at  the  PSEG  Site,  and  the  proposed  causeway  that  traverses 
the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  (EEP)  area,  would  noticeably  affect  the  aesthetic  qualities 
from  viewpoints  in  New  Castle  and  Salem  Counties.  Thus,  the  review  team  concludes  that  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  and  causeway  would  have  a  MODERATE  physical  impact  on  aesthetic 
resources  and  that  the  impacts  would  not  be  amenable  to  mitigation. 

5.4.2  Demography 

PSEG  anticipates  it  would  need  600  employees  for  operations-related  activities  at  the  PSEG 
Site.  Based  on  the  current  residential  distribution  of  the  HCGS  and  SGS  operations  workforces, 
PSEG  estimated  82.6  percent  of  the  operations  workforce  for  a  new  plant  would  live  in  the 
economic  impact  area.  In  its  ER,  PSEG  found  SMALL  impacts  using  this  assumption  and  an 
assumed  100  percent  in-migration  of  operations  workers  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

According  to  a  1981  NRC  study  (Malhotra  and  Manninen  1981-TN1430),  40  to  60  percent  of 
“nonconstruction”  workforce  in-migrated  into  the  area  surrounding  the  construction  of  a  nuclear 
power  plant.  Given  the  large  labor  pool  within  a  50-mi  radius,  the  long  history  of  nuclear  power 
operations  in  the  economic  impact  area,  and  the  existence  of  a  Nuclear  Energy  Technology 
Program  at  Salem  County  Community  College,  the  review  team  expects  that  many  of  the  skills 
needed  for  the  operations  workforce  can  be  found  locally  and  that  about  40  percent  of  the 
operations  workforce  (240  workers)  would  be  in-migrants  into  the  region.  These  workers  would 
find  homes  according  to  the  same  residential  distribution  characteristics  as  the  current  SGS  and 
HCGS  operations  workers.  In  other  words,  82.6  percent  of  the  in-migrants  (198  workers)  would 
reside  in  the  economic  impact  area,  and  the  remaining  42  workers  would  be  sparsely  distributed 
throughout  the  rest  of  the  50-mi  region  and  beyond.

November  2015 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


As  discussed  in  Section  4.4,  the  review  team  assumes  in-migrating  workers  would  bring  their 
families.  Assuming  a  household  size  of  2.68,  the  review  team  predicts  a  population  increase  of 
643  people  in  the  region  and  530  in  the  economic  impact  area.  PSEG  records  indicate  that,  of 
current  HOGS  and  SGS  employees  who  live  in  the  economic  impact  area,  12.1  percent  reside 
in  Cumberland  County,  17.7  percent  in  Gloucester  County,  49.6  percent  in  Salem  County,  and 
20.6  in  New  Castle  County  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  resulting  increase  in  population  within 
the  economic  impact  area  is  summarized  in  Table  5-4.  The  in-migration  of  operations  workers 
and  their  families  would  increase  the  population  of  the  economic  impact  area  by  about  five- 
hundredths  of  1  percent.  The  increase  would  be  most  pronounced  in  Salem  County,  which 
would  experience  a  population  increase  of  about  four-tenths  of  1  percent.  The  review  team 
considers  such  increases  to  be  minimal  for  the  counties  in  the  economic  impact  area.

Some  of  the  workers  that  would  be  employed  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  been  previously 
unemployed.  In  2013,  the  unemployment  rate  in  Salem  County  was  6.3  percent  (NJLWD- 
TN4339).  Therefore,  of  the  workforce  that  already  lives  in  the  region  (360  workers),  the  review 
team  assumes  22  of  them  would  have  been  unemployed  when  hired  by  PSEG.  Assuming  the 
same  distribution  as  the  in-migrating  workforce,  20.5  percent  of  the  unemployed  workers  would 
already  reside  in  New  Castle  County  (5  workers),  while  79.5  percent  (17  workers)  would  already 
reside  in  the  New  Jersey  counties  of  the  economic  impact  area.  In  the  economic  impact  area, 
220  jobs  would  have  been  filled  between  unemployed  workers  (22)  and  in-migrating  workers 
(198).  Some  of  these  workers  would  already  be  at  the  site  as  part  of  the  342  operations  and 
maintenance  staff  and  103  startup  personnel  during  the  building  phase.  The  impacts  of  these 
workers  are  discussed  in  Section  4.4.2. 

In  addition  to  the  full-time  operations  workforce  at  the  PSEG  Site,  1 ,000  workers  would  be 
required  every  18-24  months  for  outages.  These  workers  would  have  a  similar  residential 
distribution  as  the  HCGS  Fall  2010,  SGS  Unit  1  Fall  201 1 ,  and  SGS  Unit  2  Spring  201 1  outages 
(PSEG  2012-TN2370).  About  70  percent  of  the  outage  workers  (700  workers)  would  in-migrate 
into  the  economic  impact  area  for  less  than  a  month  at  a  time  and  then  leave  at  the  end  of  the 
outage.  Because  outages  last  less  than  a  month,  outage  workers  typically  do  not  bring  their 
families.  The  maximum  size  of  the  in-migrating  workforce  during  operations  (240  operations 
workers  and  700  outage  workers)  is  about  one  and  a-half  times  the  in-migrating  peak 
employment  building  workforce  (617).  Because  the  in-migrating  building  phase  workforce 
constituted  less  than  one-fifth  of  1  percent  of  the  baseline  population,  the  review  team  expects 
the  demographic  impact  of  in-migrating  outage  and  operations  workers  to  be  similar  to  the 
demographic  impacts  during  building,  which  were  determined  to  be  minimal.

NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


The  review  team  concludes  that  these  levels  of  increase  would  not  noticeably  affect  the 
demographic  character  of  the  economic  impact  area  or  any  of  its  counties  and,  therefore,  the 
impact  would  be  SMALL. 

A  small  number  of  operations  workers  and  their  families  would  in-migrate  to  counties  outside  of 
the  economic  impact  area.  Their  impact  on  any  one  jurisdiction  would  not  be  noticeable.  The 
current  and  projected  populations  of  the  regional  area  are  so  large  and  the  in-migrating 
population  is  so  small  that  the  in-migrating  workers  would  represent  less  than  1  percent  of  the 
total  population  in  any  of  the  counties  where  these  employees  reside.  Therefore,  the  review 
team  concludes  that  the  demographic  impacts  of  operation  on  the  remainder  of  the  50-mi  region 
also  would  be  SMALL. 

5.4.3  Economic  Impacts  to  the  Community 

This  section  evaluates  the  economic  and  tax  impacts  on  the  50-mi  region  from  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  focusing  primarily  on  Salem,  Cumberland,  and 
Gloucester  Counties  in  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle  County,  Delaware.  The  evaluation 
assesses  the  impacts  and  demands  from  the  workforce  for  operating  a  new  plant.  As  indicated 
in  Section  5.4.2,  the  review  team  assumes  that  198  workers  would  migrate  into  the  economic 
impact  area.  Assuming  a  family  size  of  2.68,  the  review  team  assumes  approximately 
530  people  would  move  into  the  economic  impact  area. 

5. 4. 3. 7  Economy 

Operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  a  positive  impact  on  the 
local  and  regional  economy  through  direct  employment  of  the  operations  workforce,  purchases 
of  materials  and  supplies  for  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  plant  and  any  capital 
expenditures  that  occur  within  the  region. 

PSEG  would  employ  600  full-time  operations  workers  and  1,000  temporary  (about  1  month) 
outage  workers  every  18-24  months.  In  2004,  the  average  income  for  employees  at  SGS  and 
HCGS  was  $77,800  (NEI  2006-TN2491 ).  Based  on  that  number  and  according  to  the  Bureau  of 
Labor  Statistics  CPI  Inflation  Calculator,  the  2013  average  wage  would  be  $95,869.  For  an 
annual  workforce  of  600,  $57.5  million  would  be  paid  in  annual  wages  to  the  region  in  2013 
dollars.  In  the  economic  impact  area,  where  82.6  percent  of  the  operations  workers  would 
reside,  $47  million  would  be  paid  in  annual  wages.  A  total  of  $18.9  million  would  be  paid 
annually  to  the  198  in-migrating  workers  into  the  economic  impact  area  and  $2.1  million  to  the 
22  formerly  unemployed  workers. 

PSEG  would  also  pay  the  wages  of  the  1 ,000  outage  workers  that  would  come  every  1 8  to 
24  months.  Compared  with  workers  required  for  construction,  outage  workers  tend  to  be  highly 
specialized  and  come  from  many  different  areas,  companies,  and  vendors.  To  estimate  the 
wage  expenditures,  the  review  team  uses  the  annual  per  capita  income  in  New  Jersey,  which  is 
$53, 1 81 ,  or  $4,431  a  month.  Assuming  1 ,000  workers  for  exactly  1  month  are  needed  for 
outages,  PSEG  would  spend  $4,431  million  every  18-24  months  to  outage  workers. 
Approximately  30  percent  of  those  outage  workers  would  be  from  the  economic  impact  area,  so 
PSEG  would  spend  about  $1.32  million  to  local  workers  every  18-24  months.

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


PSEG  would  also  purchase  materials  and  supplies  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  plant, 
and  any  capital  expenditures  that  would  occur  in  the  region  would  also  have  direct  and  indirect 
effects  on  the  local  and  regional  economy.  Table  5-5  shows  the  estimates  for  purchases  by 
PSEG  for  operating  activities  at  the  new  plant.  PSEG  has  not  selected  a  reactor  technology, 
but  the  review  team’s  calculations  are  based  on  average  purchases  at  HCGS  and  SGS  from 
2005  to  2008.  Because  the  new  plant’s  output  would  be  a  maximum  of  2,200  MW(e),  the 
review  team  assumes  that  it  would  have  approximately  60  percent  of  the  average  annual 
purchases  that  occur  at  HCGS  and  SGS,  which  have  a  total  output  of  3,655  MW(e).  As  shown 
in  Table  5-5,  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  provide  an  annual  increase  in  economic  activity 
over  the  current  baseline.  The  purchases  by  PSEG  during  operations  would  support 
employment  in  other  sectors  of  the  local  economy  at  vendors  and  shops  that  provide  materials 
and  supplies  for  operations.  The  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  Bureau  of  Economic  Analysis 
(BEA),  Economics  and  Statistics  Division,  provides  Regional  Input-Output  Modeling  System 
regional  multipliers  for  industry  employment  and  earnings.  The  review  team  obtained  multipliers 
from  the  BEA  for  the  economic  impact  area.  For  every  million  dollars  spent  by  PSEG  on 
purchases  of  services,  materials,  and  supplies,  3.8474  jobs  are  supported  in  the  economic 
impact  area  (BEA  2013-TN2594).  The  annual  spending  on  services,  materials,  and  supplies 
would  support  approximately  60  additional  jobs  in  the  economic  impact  area.

New  workers  (i.e.,  in-migrating  workers  and  those  previously  unemployed)  would  have  an 
additional  indirect  effect  on  the  local  economy  because  they  would  stimulate  the  local  economy 
by  their  spending  on  goods  and  services  in  other  industries.  This  spending  results  in  economic 
demand  for  a  fraction  of  another  indirect  job.  The  review  team  obtained  multipliers  from  the 
BEA  for  the  economic  impact  area.  The  review  team  did  not  include  currently  employed 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


workers  who  would  be  employed  at  the  PSEG  Site  because  their  direct  and  indirect  effects  are 
already  included  in  the  economic  impact  area  baseline. 

In  the  economic  impact  area,  BEA  estimates  that  for  every  new  utility  industry  worker,  an 
additional  1.3032  workers  in  all  industries  is  created  (BEA  2013-TN2594).  According  to  the 
analysis  above,  PSEG  would  hire  198  in-migrating  workers  and  22  unemployed  workers.  These 
220  direct  jobs  would  result  in  286  indirect  jobs  created  (220  *  1 .3032).  For  the  purposes  of  this 
analysis,  the  review  team  expects  these  indirect  workers  to  already  reside  in  the  economic 
impact  area.  The  impacts  to  each  county  are  estimated  in  Table  5-6.  BEA  also  estimates  the 
indirect  earnings  multiplier  in  the  economic  impact  area.  This  multiplier  was  applied  to  the 
wages  of  new  workers  to  determine  the  effect  of  direct  earnings  on  the  local  economy.  For 
every  dollar  of  wages  earned  by  new  workers  during  operations,  BEA  estimates  an  additional 
$0.5276  in  income  would  be  added  in  the  economic  impact  area.  The  $21  million  annual 
compensation  from  the  newly  hired  workers  would  lead  to  an  estimated  $1 1 .08  million  in  annual 
indirect  wages  ($21  million  *  0.5276)  (BEA  201 3-TN2594). 

Given  the  size  of  the  economies  and  workforces  in  the  economic  impact  area,  the  review  team 
estimates  the  impact  of  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minor,  and  positive.

5. 4. 3. 2  Taxes 

The  tax  structure  for  the  economic  impact  area  and  region  is  discussed  in  Section  2. 5. 2. 2. 
Primary  tax  revenues  associated  with  operating  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  from 
(1)  State  and  local  taxes  on  worker  incomes,  (2)  State  sales  taxes  on  worker  expenditures, 

(3)  State  sales  taxes  on  the  purchases  of  materials  and  supplies,  (4)  corporate  taxes,  and 
(5)  local  property  taxes  or  payments  in  lieu  of  taxes  based  on  the  assessed  value  of  the  new 
PSEG  plant  during  operation. 

State  and  Local  Income  Taxes 

Delaware  and  New  Jersey  would  receive  additional  income  tax  revenue  from  the  income  tax  on 
wages  of  new  workers.  Table  5-7  summarizes  the  estimated  new  income  tax  revenue  that 
would  be  received  by  the  two  states  during  operations.  The  exact  amount  of  income  tax 
revenue  would  be  determined  on  the  basis  of  many  factors  such  as  rates,  residency  status, 
deductions,  and  other  factors.

(a)  DEDO  2012-TN2390;  assumed  $1,001  +  5.55%  per  worker. 

(b)  N J  T reasury  201 0-TN2338;  assumed  a  tax  rate  of  6.279%  or  an  average  of  income  tax  rates  of  1 .4%  to 

8.97%. 

The  majority  of  the  operations  workforce  would  already  live  in  the  region,  would  commute  daily 
from  the  site,  and  would  not  be  unemployed  prior  to  operations.  For  the  purposes  of  this 
analysis,  the  review  team  assumes  that  all  the  workers  (unemployed  and  in-migrating)  would 
live  in  the  economic  impact  area.  Approximately  220  workers  would  be  newly  employed  and 
would  then  pay  income  taxes.  Forty-six  workers  would  pay  income  tax  in  Delaware,  and 
174  would  pay  in  New  Jersey.  They  would  provide  $0.24  million  and  $1.05  million  in  additional 
income  tax  revenue  to  Delaware  and  New  Jersey,  respectively.  This  is  an  increase  of 
approximately  two-hundredths  of  1  percent  in  Delaware  and  one-hundredth  of  1  percent  in  New 
Jersey,  compared  to  201 1  revenue.  The  indirect  workers  would  also  pay  income  taxes,  but 
because  the  amount  of  indirect  jobs  created  is  similar  to  the  newly  employed  workforce 
(286  versus  220  workers),  their  tax  payments  would  be  minimal  compared  with  the  tax  base  in 
New  Jersey  and  Delaware. 

The  addition  of  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  a  noticeable  and  beneficial  impact  on 
New  Jersey’s  corporate  income  tax  revenue. 

No  localities  within  the  economic  impact  area  impose  extra  income  taxes  on  workers.  The 
review  team  believes  the  impact  from  extra  income  taxes  on  state  revenue  would  be  minimal 
and  beneficial. 

State  Sales  Taxes  on  Worker  Expenditures 

Workers  would  spend  some  of  their  income  on  goods  and  services  that  may  be  taxed.  New 
Jersey  imposes  a  7  percent  sales  tax;  however,  Delaware  does  not  impose  a  sales  tax.  No 
localities  in  the  economic  impact  area  impose  an  additional  sales  tax.  Because  Delaware 
imposes  no  sales  tax  and  New  Jersey’s  201 1  revenue  from  sales  taxes  was  over  $1 1  billion, 
the  review  team  expects  a  minimal,  beneficial  impact  on  state  sales  tax  revenue  from 
in-migrating  and  previously  unemployed  worker  expenditures. 

State  Sales  Taxes  on  Materials  and  Supplies 

Section  5.4.3. 1  discusses  the  review  team’s  estimates  of  PSEG  expenditures  in  the  economic 
impact  area,  region,  and  beyond  during  operations.  These  expenditures  may  be  subject  to 
sales  taxes.  New  Jersey  and  Pennsylvania  have  sales  taxes  of  7  and  6  percent,  respectively. 
Delaware  does  not  impose  sales  taxes.  Some  localities  in  New  Jersey  and  Pennsylvania 


November  2015 


5-53 


NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


impose  additional  sales  taxes  (e.g.,  Philadelphia  County  imposes  an  extra  2  percent  sales  tax). 
However,  none  in  the  economic  impact  area  impose  extra  sales  taxes. 

During  operations,  the  review  team  estimates  over  $339  million  a  year  would  be  spent  in  New 
Jersey  and  over  $162  million  would  be  spent  in  Pennsylvania.  These  expenditures  would 
bring  in  approximately  $23.7  million  and  $9.7  million  in  sales  tax  revenue  in  New  Jersey  and 
Pennsylvania,  respectively  (Table  5-8).  These  would  account  for  sales  tax  revenue  increases 
of  two-tenths  of  1  percent  and  almost  six-hundredths  of  1  percent  in  New  Jersey  and 
Pennsylvania,  respectively.  Therefore,  the  review  team  believes  that  there  would  be  a  minimal 
and  beneficial  impact  on  sales  tax  revenues  during  operations.

Corporate  Income  Taxes 

PSEG  would  also  pay  to  New  Jersey  a  corporate  energy  receipts  tax  of  9  percent  of  its  annual 
revenue  each  year  during  operations.  In  2011,  New  Jersey  received  $2.2  billion  in  corporate 
income  tax  revenue,  and  PSEG  paid  a  total  of  $146  million  for  all  of  its  business  operations 
(PSEG  201 1-TN3327).  Assuming  a  dual-unit  API  000  design  (the  largest  in  the  ER’s  PPE  in 
terms  of  megawatts  (electrical)  and  a  95  percent  capacity  factor,  PSEG  would  pay  the  energy 
receipts  tax  on  about  18,469  million  kWh  of  electricity  sold  in  the  state  of  New  Jersey.  At  an 
average  retail  rate  of  14.68  cents  per  kilowatt-hour  (DOE  2012-TN2524),  PSEG  would  have 
estimated  annual  revenues  of  about  $2.7  billion  and  would  pay  an  energy  receipts  tax  of  about 
$244  million  to  the  State  of  New  Jersey;  this  would  be  equal  to  about  1 1  percent  of  the  State’s 
201 1  corporate  income  tax  receipts. 

Assuming  an  Advanced  Boiling  Water  Reactor  (ABWR)  design  (the  smallest  in  the  ER’s  PPE  in 
terms  of  megawatts  (electrical)  and  a  95  percent  capacity  factor,  PSEG  would  pay  the  energy 
receipts  tax  on  about  10,914  million  kWh  of  electricity  sold  in  the  state  of  New  Jersey.  At  an 
average  retail  rate  of  14.68  cents  per  kilowatt-hour,  PSEG  would  have  estimated  annual 
revenues  of  about  $1 .6  billion  and  would  pay  an  energy  receipts  tax  of  about  $144  million  to  the 
State  of  New  Jersey;  this  would  be  equal  to  about  6.5  percent  of  the  State’s  201 1  corporate 
income  tax  receipts. 

Property  Taxes 

The  review  team  assumes  the  198  in-migrating  operations  workers  would  have  to  either 
purchase  an  existing  home  or  build  a  new  home  in  the  economic  impact  area.  For  existing 
homes,  the  property  tax  effect  would  be  zero,  because  the  residence  would  already  be  on  the 


NUREG-2168 


5-54 


November  2015 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


tax  rolls  for  the  county  and  township.  For  new  homes,  the  review  team  believes  only  a  limited 
number  of  in-migrating  workers  would  prefer  to  build  rather  than  buy  an  existing  structure. 

Given  the  magnitude  of  the  property  tax  base  in  each  of  the  four  counties  in  the  economic 
impact  area,  the  contribution  of  new  real  property  to  each  area  would  result  in  a  minor  but 
beneficial  impact. 

All  of  the  real  property  and  improvements  related  to  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  be  located  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  primarily  in  the  Lower  Alloways  Creek 
Township.  However,  the  review  team  determined  through  interviews  with  the  chief  financial 
officer  for  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township  that  the  township  does  not  have  a  property  tax  or  a 
school  tax,  but  instead  relies  on  the  distribution  of  the  energy  receipts  tax  from  the  State 
government.  The  review  team  also  determined  that  Salem  County  imposes  a  $1,207  per 
hundred  dollars  of  assessed  value  property  tax  on  all  improvements  and  that  PSEG  pays  the 
same  rate  (NRC  2012-TN2499).  For  an  API 000  design,  the  expected  property  tax  revenue  to 
Salem  County  would  be  about  $120  million  in  the  first  year  of  operation,  declining  thereafter 
over  the  40-year  life  of  the  plant.*1)  Over  the  40  years  of  service,  the  API  000  design  would 
generate  a  total  of  about  $2.5  billion  in  property  taxes  to  Salem  County.  For  the  ABWR  design, 
the  property  tax  revenue  would  be  about  $71  million  in  the  first  year  of  operation,  with  a  40-year 
total  of  about  $1 .4  billion  in  property  taxes.  Salem  County’s  2013  budget  shows  an  expected 
total  revenue  of  $84  million  (Salem  County  2013-TN2576).  Therefore,  the  proposed  project 
would  add  be  between  about  140  percent  (API 000)  and  82  percent  (ABWR)  to  the  current 
Salem  County  budget  in  the  first  year.  Consequently,  the  review  team  determined  that  Salem 
County  would  experience  a  major  and  beneficial  impact  from  the  anticipated  new  property  tax 
revenues,  and  the  economic  impact  area  would  experience  a  minimal  and  beneficial  impact. 

5. 4. 3. 3  Summary  of  Economic  Impacts  to  the  Community 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  evaluation  and 
outreach,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  economic  impacts  would  be  SMALL  and  beneficial 
for  the  region  and  the  economic  impact  area.  The  review  team  predicts  SMALL  and  beneficial 
impacts  to  sales  and  excise  tax  and  income  tax  receipts  in  the  economic  impact  area  and 
region.  The  review  team  also  predicts  MODERATE  and  beneficial  impacts  to  the  State  of  New 
Jersey  from  PSEG  corporate  tax  payments  and  LARGE  and  beneficial  impacts  to  Salem  County 
from  property  tax  payments. 

5.4.4  Infrastructure  and  Community  Service  Impacts 

This  section  provides  the  estimated  impacts  on  infrastructure  and  community  services,  including 
transportation,  recreation,  housing,  public  services,  and  education.

TN2650).

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


5. 4. 4. 7  Traffic 

Existing  transportation  routes  would  be  affected  by  an  increase  in  commuter  traffic  to  and  from 
the  PSEG  Site  associated  with  the  operations  and  outages  workforce  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The 
workforce  for  the  new  plant  would  primarily  use  the  proposed  causeway  to  avoid  disruptions  to 
the  HCGS  and  SGS  workforces  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  proposed  causeway  would 
separate  all  traffic  to  and  from  the  new  plant  from  traffic  associated  with  the  existing  HCGS  and 
SGS  operations.  The  impacts  from  these  two  streams  of  traffic  would  interact  when  they 
converge  around  Salem  City  (PSEG  2013-TN2525). 

PSEG  conducted  a  traffic  impact  analysis  (TIA)  to  determine  traffic  impacts  around  the  PSEG 
Site.  The  TIA  analyzed  deterioration  of  LOS  on  roads  and  intersections  in  Salem  County.  The 
TIA  used  the  following  assumptions:  (1)  the  maximum  anticipated  construction  workforce; 

(2)  build-out  year  of  2021;  (3)  assumed  selection  of  key  routes  although  other,  less-traveled 
routes  are  available;  and  (4)  traffic  load  is  based  upon  a  combination  of  peak  construction, 
outage  workforce,  maximum  operations  workforce  present  during  building  at  the  PSEG,  and 
baseline  background  traffic  (which  incorporates  current  HCGS  and  SGS  employees)  at  once 
(PSEG  2013-TN2525).  The  analysis  in  the  TIA  assumes  a  worst-case  traffic  scenario 
compared  to  the  analysis  presented  by  PSEG  in  its  ER.  Further  discussion  of  the  analysis  and 
its  assumptions  are  in  Section  4.4.4. 1. 

The  TIA  suggests  certain  mitigation  measures  to  alleviate  traffic  impacts  during  building,  which 
are  discussed  in  Section  4.4.4. 1.  According  to  Table  4-13,  some  intersections  would  have 
unacceptable  LOS  values  in  the  future  no-build  scenario.  Even  with  conservative  assumptions 
in  the  TIA,  these  intersections  show  improvement  with  the  implementation  of  suggested 
mitigation  measures.  Because  the  operations  workforce  and  the  outage  workforce  are 
significantly  smaller  than  the  assumptions  used  in  the  TIA  (approximately  1 ,200-1 ,300  vehicles 
per  day  compared  to  nearly  5,000  as  discussed  in  Table  4-12),  the  review  team  expects  impacts 
from  traffic  in  the  economic  impact  area  to  be  minimal  and  localized.  The  greatest  impacts 
would  be  during  shift  changes  with  an  outage  in  process. 

5. 4. 4. 2  Recreation 

Recreational  resources  in  the  economic  impact  area  may  be  affected  by  operations  activities  at 
the  PSEG  Site.  Impacts  may  include  (1 )  increased  user  demand  associated  with  the  projected 
increase  in  population  as  a  result  of  the  in-migrating  workforce  and  their  families,  (2)  an 
impaired  recreational  experience  associated  with  the  views  of  the  site  and  the  potential  cooling 
tower,  and  (3)  access  delays  associated  with  increased  traffic  from  extra  traffic  on  local 
roadways.  Increased  user  demand  as  a  result  of  the  in-migrating  population  may  include 
increased  competition  for  recreational  vehicle  spaces  at  campgrounds  and  at  hotels/motels, 
which  could  be  used  for  temporary  housing  for  some  of  the  workforce  during  outages  or  for 
recreational  purposes  by  the  new  operations  workforce. 

As  discussed  in  Section  5.4.1,  there  would  be  some  aesthetic  impacts  at  recreational  areas  that 
have  an  unobstructed  view  of  the  PSEG  Site.  These  areas  are  typically  across  the  Delaware 
River  in  Delaware.  There  would  be  additional  aesthetic  impacts  from  PSEG’s  EEP  viewing 
platforms.  Operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  add  to  the  already  industrial  nature  of  the  site. 


NUREG-2168 


5-56 


November  2015 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Also,  people  using  recreational  facilities  in  Salem  County  may  experience  traffic  congestion  on 
the  roads  during  morning  and  afternoon  commutes  of  the  operations  and  outage  workforces. 

However,  because  60  percent  of  the  operations  workforce  already  lives  within  commuting 
distance  of  the  PSEG  Site,  the  review  team  does  not  expect  the  in-migrating  portion  of  the 
operations  workforce  would  place  any  stresses  upon  the  capacity  of  recreational  facilities  near 
the  site.  The  economic  impact  area  and  region’s  parks  and  recreational  facilities  have  sufficient 
capacity  to  accommodate  in-migrating  workers  and  their  families  and  the  review  team  expects 
no  impact  to  trapping  near  the  site  (NRC  2012-TN2499). 

The  review  team  expects  the  impacts  to  recreational  activities  in  the  vicinity  to  be  minimal, 
except  for  a  noticeable  but  not  destabilizing  aesthetic  impact  from  operations  at  the  site  that 
would  not  be  amenable  to  mitigation. 

5. 4. 4. 3  Housing 

Section  2. 5. 2. 5  discusses  housing  information  for  the  economic  impact  area.  According  to 
Table  2-30,  there  are  30,578  vacant  units  in  the  economic  impact  area.  As  discussed  in  Section 
5.4.2,  1 98  workers  and  their  families  would  move  into  the  economic  impact  area.  The  rest  of 
the  operations  workforce  is  expected  to  come  from  the  region  and  commute  daily  to  the  site, 
therefore  having  no  impact  on  the  housing  stock. 

The  in-migrating  workers  and  families  may  choose  to  buy  available  vacant  housing  or  rent. 

Table  5-9  shows  the  estimated  impact  on  housing  availability  for  the  in-migrating  families.  As 
shown  in  the  table,  there  are  minimal  impacts  on  housing  supply.

Operations  workers  are  more  likely  to  take  advantage  of  the  permanent  housing  stock  or  build 
new  homes.  Outage  workers  are  more  likely  to  take  advantage  of  the  temporary  housing  stock 
because  they  are  expected  to  be  at  the  PSEG  Site  for  a  relatively  short  period  of  time.  In 
addition  to  the  housing  stock  for  owner-occupied  housing  and  rental  units,  there  is  also  sufficient 
stock  of  temporary  housing  in  the  economic  impact  area  if  workers  decide  to  stay  in  hotels, 
motels,  or  campgrounds.  Salem  County  officials  also  indicate  that  many  outage  workers  who 
come  from  outside  the  region  rent  rooms  in  single-family  homes  in  localities  near  the  site 
(NRC  2012-TN2499). 

Given  the  large  supply  of  vacant  housing  relative  to  the  in-migrating  operations  workforce  during 
operations  and  the  availability  of  short-term  accommodations  for  outage  workers,  the  review 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


team  expects  sufficient  housing  to  be  available  for  workers  relocating  to  the  area  and  minimal 
impacts  on  the  housing  supply  or  prices  in  the  local  area. 

Operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  could  affect  housing  values  in  the  vicinity.  In  a  review  of  previous 
studies  on  the  effect  of  seven  nuclear  power  facilities,  including  four  nuclear  power  plants,  on 
property  values  in  surrounding  communities,  Bezdek  and  Wendling  (Bezdek  and  Wendling 
2006-TN2748)  concluded  that  assessed  valuations  and  median  housing  prices  have  tended  to 
increase  at  rates  above  national  and  State  averages.  Clark  et  al.  (1997-TN3000)  similarly  found 
that  housing  prices  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  two  nuclear  power  plants  in  California  were  not 
affected  by  any  negative  views  of  the  facilities.  These  findings  differ  from  studies  that  looked  at 
undesirable  facilities,  largely  related  to  hazardous  waste  sites  and  landfills,  but  also  including 
several  studies  on  power  facilities  (Farber  1998-TN2857)  in  which  property  values  were 
negatively  affected  in  the  short-term,  but  these  effects  were  moderated  over  time.  Bezdek  and 
Wendling  (2006-TN2748)  attributed  the  increase  in  housing  prices  to  benefits  provided  to  the 
community  in  terms  of  employment  and  tax  revenues,  with  surplus  tax  revenues  encouraging 
other  private  development  in  the  area.  Given  the  findings  from  the  studies  discussed  above,  the 
review  team  determines  that  the  impact  on  housing  value  from  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  be  minor. 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG,  interviews  with  local  officials,  and  its  own 
independent  review,  the  review  team  expects  there  would  be  minimal  impacts  in  the  economic 
impact  area  and  the  region  on  the  price  and  availability  of  housing  from  operations  at  the  PSEG 
Site. 

5. 4. 4. 4  Public  Services 

This  section  discusses  the  impacts  on  existing  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  police,  fire, 
and  health  care  services  in  the  economic  impact  area. 

Water  Supply  and  Wastewater  Treatment  Services 

Approximately  60  percent  of  the  project  operations  workforce  would  be  local  workers  who 
currently  reside  in  the  region.  The  majority  of  these  workers  would  commute  from  their  homes 
to  the  project  site  and  would  not  relocate.  Therefore,  the  majority  of  workers  are  currently 
served  by  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities  within  the  communities  where 
they  reside. 

During  operations,  the  review  team  expects  198  workers  (530  people,  including  families)  to 
move  into  the  economic  impact  area.  These  relocating  workers  would  increase  the  demand  on 
the  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment  services  within  the  communities  where  they  reside. 

The  review  team  calculated  the  increase  in  demand  for  residential  water  based  on  the  increase 
in  people  and  using  the  New  Jersey  per  capita  demand  of  100  gallons  per  day  (gpd) 

(Barnett  2010-TN2484).  Table  5-10  shows  the  impact  of  the  increased  population  on  the 
excess  capacity  within  each  county  of  the  economic  impact  area.  As  shown  in  Table  5-10,  each 
county  has  less  than  a  1  percent  increase  in  demand  on  current  excess  capacity.

Given  the  small  increase  in  demand  that  would  result  from  the  in-migrating  workers  and  their 
families  compared  to  existing  supply,  the  review  team  has  determined  that  impacts  on  water 
supply  in  the  economic  impact  area  would  be  minimal,  and  mitigation  would  not  be  warranted. 

The  review  team  calculated  the  increase  in  demand  for  residential  wastewater  treatment  based 
on  the  increase  in  population  and  by  using  the  New  Jersey  per  capita  demand  for  wastewater 
treatment  of  75  gpd  (SJBC  2012-TN2485).  Table  5-1 1  shows  the  impact  of  the  increased 
population  on  the  excess  capacity  within  each  county's  wastewater  treatment  facilities  within  the 
economic  impact  area.  As  shown  in  Table  5-1 1 ,  no  county  in  the  economic  impact  area  would 
have  greater  than  a  1  percent  increase  in  demand  on  excess  capacity. 

Given  the  small  increase  in  demand  that  would  result  from  the  in-migrating  workers  and  their 
families  compared  with  existing  supply,  the  review  team  has  determined  that  impacts  on 
wastewater  treatment  in  the  economic  impact  area  would  be  minimal,  and  mitigation  would  not 
be  warranted.

PS7EG  indicates  that  a  freshwater  aquifer  that  currently  supplies  HCGS  and  SGS  would  also 
supply  the  new  plant  with  potable  and  sanitary  water,  fire  protection  water,  and  water  for  other 
miscellaneous  uses.  PSEG  indicates  that  it  would  need  between  302.400  and  1.37  million  gpd 
on  the  site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  review  team  believes  this  impact  would  be  negligible 
and  would  be  subject  to  permit  requirements.  Further  analysis  of  groundwater  withdrawal 
during  operation  is  in  Section  5.2.  PSEG  also  has  an  onsite  wastewater  treatment  facility  for 
HCGS  and  SGS,  but  it  was  sized  only  to  meet  the  demand  of  HCGS  and  SGS.  PSEG  would 
install  a  new  sewage  treatment  facility  or  expand  the  existing  one  to  meet  needs  for  the

construction  and  operations  workforce  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  so  there  would  be  no 
offsite  treatment  of  wastewater  from  the  new  plant  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Therefore,  there 
would  be  no  impact  on  public  wastewater  facilities  from  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  review  team  has  concluded  from  the  information  provided  by  PSEG,  interviews  with  local 
planners  and  officials,  and  its  own  independent  evaluation  that  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  have  minimal  impacts  on  the  local  water  supply  and  on  wastewater  treatment  facilities, 
and  no  mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

Police,  Fire,  and  Health  Care  Services 

The  operations  workforce  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  increase  the  demand  on  police,  fire,  and 
health  care  services  within  the  communities  where  workers  reside  and  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Approximately  60  percent  of  the  project  workforce  would  be  local  workers  who  currently  reside 
in  the  region.  The  majority  of  these  workers  would  commute  from  their  homes  to  the  project  site 
and  would  not  relocate.  Therefore,  the  majority  of  workers  are  currently  served  by  the  police, 
fire,  and  health  care  services  within  the  communities  where  they  reside. 

During  operations,  the  review  team  expects  198  workers  and  their  families  to  move  into  the 
economic  impact  area.  This  constitutes  a  total  of  530  people  moving  into  the  economic  impact 
area  during  operations.  These  relocating  workers  would  increase  the  demand  on  the  police, 
fire,  and  health  care  services  within  the  communities  where  they  reside. 

No  county  in  the  economic  impact  area  would  have  a  population  increase  greater  than  one-half 
of  1  percent.  In  discussion  with  local  officials  of  the  localities  closest  to  the  site — Lower 
Alloways  Creek  Township,  Elsinboro  Township,  and  Salem  County —  the  review  team  found  no 
need  to  increase  police,  fire,  or  health  care  services  because  of  in-migrating  operations  workers. 
The  review  team,  after  discussion  with  local  officials,  found  that  with  the  minimal  increases  in 
population,  there  should  be  only  a  negligible  effect  on  the  performance  of  police,  fire,  and  health 
care  services  in  the  economic  impact  area. 

Locally,  Elsinboro  Township  receives  police  services  from  a  contract  with  Lower  Alloways  Creek 
Township,  and  its  fire  and  emergency  medical  services  (EMS)  are  volunteer-based.  Lower 
Alloways  Creek  Township  and  Salem  City  have  their  own  police  force  and  volunteer  fire/EMS 
forces.  Salem  County  also  has  a  sheriffs  office  and  is  patrolled  by  State  police.  All  hospitals  in 
the  area  are  under  capacity  (NRC  2012-TN2499).  Because  of  their  proximity  to  the  site,  these 
three  jurisdictions  in  Salem  County  would  receive  the  most  impacts  from  operations  and  outage 
worker  injuries  or  accidents  on  the  roads  leading  to  the  site  and  at  the  site.  After  discussions 
with  local  officials  and  its  own  independent  analysis,  the  review  team  expects  a  minimal  impact 
on  these  services  from  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site,  and  no  mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

5. 4. 4. 5  Education 

The  operations  workforce  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  increase  the  demand  for  educational  services 
within  the  communities  where  workers  reside.  Approximately  60  percent  of  the  project 
workforce  would  be  local  workers  who  currently  reside  in  the  region.  The  majority  of  these 
workers  would  commute  from  their  homes  to  the  project  site  and  would  not  relocate.  Therefore, 


NUREG-2168

November  2015 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


the  majority  of  workers  are  currently  served  by  the  educational  services  within  the  communities 
in  which  they  reside. 

As  shown  in  Table  5-12,  during  operations  there  would  be  an  estimated  increase  of  34  students 
in  the  economic  impact  area.  This  is  a  small  increase  compared  to  the  existing  rolls  in  the 
economic  impact  area  (over  160,000  students,  as  shown  in  Table  2-34).  No  county  in  the 
economic  impact  area  would  have  a  noticeable  increase  in  the  number  of  students  per  teacher. 
The  only  increase  in  student-to-teacher  ratios  would  be  in  Salem  County,  where  the  review 
team  estimated  an  increase  of  one-hundredth  of  one  student  per  teacher.  Some  schools  may 
receive  higher  numbers  of  children  during  operations  because  of  amenities  and  the  school 
choice  programs  available  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware.  Because  of  these  estimates,  the 
public  choice  programs,  and  discussions  with  local  officials,  the  review  team  foresees  minimal 
impacts  on  local  school  districts. 

Based  on  the  review  team’s  independent  analysis  and  discussions  with  local  officials,  the  review 
finds  that  the  impacts  to  schools  in  the  economic  impact  area  would  be  minimal,  and  no 
mitigation  would  be  warranted.

5. 4. 4. 6  Summary  of  Community  Service  and  Infrastructure  Impacts 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  evaluation  and 
outreach,  the  review  team  concludes  that  impacts  to  all  infrastructure  and  community  services 
would  be  SMALL  for  the  region  and  the  economic  impact  area,  with  the  exception  of 
recreational  impacts  near  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review  team  expects  MODERATE  adverse 
impacts  to  local  recreational  resources  because  of  impacts  on  viewsheds  from  the  increased 
industrial  character  of  the  PSEG  Site. 

5.4.5  Summary  of  Socioeconomics 

The  review  team  has  assessed  the  activities  related  to  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  and  the  potential  socioeconomic  impacts  in  the  region  and  economic  impact 
area.  Physical  impacts  on  workers  and  the  general  public  include  those  on  noise  levels,  air

NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


quality,  existing  buildings,  roads,  and  aesthetics.  The  review  team  concludes  most  physical 
impacts  from  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL,  with  the  exception  of  a 
MODERATE  impact  to  aesthetics  that  could  not  be  reduced  through  mitigation. 

On  the  basis  of  information  supplied  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team  interviews  conducted  with 
public  officials,  the  review  team  concludes  that  impacts  from  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  on  the 
demographics  of  the  region  and  economic  impact  area  would  be  SMALL.  Economic  impacts 
throughout  the  region  and  economic  impact  area  would  be  SMALL  and  beneficial.  Tax  impacts 
would  be  SMALL  and  beneficial  throughout  the  region  and  economic  impact  area,  with  the 
exceptions  of  MODERATE  and  beneficial  corporate  income  payments  to  New  Jersey  and 
LARGE  and  beneficial  property  tax  payments  to  Salem  County. 

Infrastructure  and  community  services  impacts  span  issues  associated  with  traffic,  recreation, 
housing,  public  services,  and  education.  Impacts  from  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  on  traffic, 
housing,  public  services,  and  education  would  be  SMALL.  Recreational  impacts  would  be 
MODERATE  and  adverse  because  of  impacts  on  viewsheds  from  the  increased  industrial 
character  of  the  PSEG  Site,  which  would  not  be  amenable  to  mitigation. 

5.5  Environmental  Justice 

The  review  team  evaluated  whether  minority  or  low-income  populations  would  experience 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  human  health  or  environmental  effects  from  the  operation 
of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  To  perform  this  assessment,  the  review  team 
(1)  identified  (through  U.S.  Census  Bureau  and  American  Community  Survey  demographic 
data,  PSEG’s  ER,  and  on-the-ground  assessments)  minority  and  low-income  populations  of 
interest;  (2)  identified  all  potentially  significant  pathways  for  human  health,  environmental, 
physical,  and  socioeconomic  effects  on  those  identified  populations  of  interest;  and 
(3)  determined  whether  or  not  the  characteristics  of  the  pathway  or  special  circumstances  of  the 
minority  or  low-income  populations  would  result  in  a  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impact. 

To  perform  this  assessment,  the  review  team  followed  the  methodology  described  in 
Section  2.6.1.  In  the  context  of  operations  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site,  the  review  team 
considered  the  questions  outlined  in  Section  2.6.1.  For  all  three  health-related  questions,  the 
review  team  determined  that  the  level  of  environmental  emissions  projected  is  well  below  the 
protection  levels  established  by  NRC  and  EPA  regulations  and  would  not  impose  a 
disproportionate  and  adverse  effect  on  minority  or  low-income  populations. 

5.5.1  Health  Impacts 

Section  5.8  assesses  the  nonradiological  health  effects  for  operations  workers  and  the  local 
population  from  fugitive  dust,  noise,  occupational  injuries,  and  transport  of  materials  and 
personnel.  In  Section  5.8,  the  review  team  concludes  that  nonradiological  health  impacts  would 
be  SMALL.  The  review  team’s  investigation  and  outreach  did  not  identify  any  unique 
characteristics  or  practices  among  minority  or  low-income  populations  that  might  result  in 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  nonradiological  health  effects. 


NUREG-2168

November  2015 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Section  5.9  of  this  EIS  assesses  the  radiological  doses  to  the  operations  workforce  and  the  local 
population  and  concludes  that  the  doses  would  be  within  NRC  and  EPA  dose  standards. 

Section  5.9  concludes  that  radiological  health  impacts  on  the  operations  workforce  at  the  PSEG 
Site  would  be  SMALL. 

During  operations  at  a  new  plant,  PSEG  would  be  required  to  maintain  a  Radiological 
Environmental  Monitoring  Program  (REMP).  The  REMP  program  assesses  the  impact  of  the 
plant  on  the  environment,  and  samples  of  environmental  media  are  collected  and  analyzed  for 
radioactivity.  A  plant  effect  would  be  indicated  if  the  radioactive  material  detected  in  a  sample 
was  significantly  larger  than  the  background  level.  The  results  of  the  2009  REMP  sampling  and 
previous  REMP  reports  at  HCGS  and  SGS  indicate  that  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not 
result  in  any  offsite  impacts.  The  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection’s  Bureau 
of  Nuclear  Engineering  performs  an  independent  Environmental  Surveillance  and  Monitoring 
Program  (ESMP)  in  the  environment  around  HCGS  and  SGS.  The  ESMP  monitors  pathways 
for  entry  of  radioactivity  into  the  environment  to  identify  potential  exposures  to  the  population 
from  routine  and  accidental  releases  of  radioactive  effluent  and  to  provide  a  summary  and 
interpretation  of  this  information  to  members  of  the  public  and  government  agencies.  The  2008 
report  indicated  that,  overall,  there  were  no  received  measurable  exposures  of  radiation  above 
normal  background  to  residents  living  in  the  area  around  HCGS  and  SGS  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ). 
Per  regulatory  requirements,  the  review  team  expects  similar  results  for  a  new  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  Based  on  this  information,  the  review  team  concludes  that  there  would  be  no 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impact  on  low-income  or  minority  populations. 

5.5.2  Physical  and  Environmental  Impacts 

For  the  physical  and  environmental  considerations  described  in  Section  2.6.1 ,  the  review  team 
determined  through  literature  searches  and  consultations  that  (1)  the  impacts  on  the  natural  or 
physical  environment  would  not  significantly  or  adversely  affect  a  particular  group;  (2)  no 
minority  or  low-income  population  would  experience  an  adverse  impact  that  would  appreciably 
exceed  or  be  likely  to  appreciably  exceed  those  of  the  general  population;  and  (3)  the 
environmental  effects  would  not  occur  in  groups  affected  by  cumulative  or  multiple  adverse 
exposure  from  environmental  hazards. 

The  review  team  determined  that  the  physical  and  environmental  impacts  from  operations  at  the 
PSEG  Site  would  attenuate  rapidly  with  distance,  intervening  foliage,  and  terrain.  There  are 
four  primary  exposure  media  in  the  environment:  soil,  water,  air,  and  noise.  The  following 
subsections  discuss  each  of  these  pathways  in  greater  detail. 

5.5.2. 7  Soil 

The  review  team  did  not  identify  any  pathway  by  which  operations-related  impacts  on  soils  at 
the  PSEG  Site  would  impose  a  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impact  on  any  population  of 
interest.  The  review  team  considers  the  risk  of  soil  salinization  from  cooling  towers  to  be  low. 
Therefore,  the  review  team  determines  there  is  no  soil-related  pathway  by  which  minority  or 
low-income  populations  of  interest  could  receive  a  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impact. 


November  2015 


5-63 


NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


5. 5.2. 2  Water 

Operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  could  affect  the  water  quality  in  the  Delaware  River  and  water  use 
of  the  Delaware  River.  Water-quality  impacts  result  from  increased  stormwater  runoff  from  the 
impervious  surfaces  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  thermal  and  chemical  constituents  in  the  cooling 
water  discharges.  As  discussed  in  Sections  5.2  and  5.3.2,  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  would 
generate  a  small  thermal  plume  from  cooling  water  discharge  into  the  Delaware  River.  Solutes 
in  the  effluent  discharged  would  be  diluted  by  the  large  water  volume  of  the  Delaware  River.  In 
addition,  discharges  would  be  required  to  comply  with  limits  imposed  by  permits.  Consequently, 
the  increase  in  temperature  and  concentration  of  these  chemicals  and  the  thermal  plume 
impacts  in  the  Delaware  River  would  be  negligible.  Therefore,  the  review  team  determines 
there  is  no  water-related  pathway  by  which  minority  or  low-income  populations  of  interest  could 
receive  a  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impact. 

5. 5. 2. 3  Air 

Air  emissions  sources  associated  with  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  include  standby 
diesel  generators  and/or  gas  turbines,  auxiliary  boilers,  diesel-driven  pumps,  and  other  ancillary 
equipment.  These  emissions  sources  would  be  small,  occur  infrequently  or  mostly  during  the 
winter  months,  and  be  permitted  for  use  by  a  Clean  Air  Act  (CAA,  42  USC  7401  et  seq.  - 
TN1 141 )  Permit.  Modifications  to  the  SGS  and  HCGS  Title  V  Operating  Permit  under  the  CAA 
from  the  NJDEP  would  be  required  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  addressing 
emissions  and  compliance  with  State  and  Federal  regulations  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Cooling 
towers  would  emit  small  amounts  of  particulate  matter  as  drift.  However,  emissions  from  these 
sources  would  be  expected  to  have  only  a  minimal  impact  on  ambient  air  quality  in  offsite 
communities.  Therefore,  the  review  team  determines  there  is  no  air-related  pathway  by  which 
minority  or  low-income  populations  of  interest  could  receive  a  disproportionately  high  and 
adverse  impact. 

5. 5. 2. 4  Noise 

Primary  noise  sources  associated  with  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  cooling  towers 
and  transformers.  As  noted  in  Section  5.8.2,  noise  from  the  transformers  and  cooling  towers 
would  be  buffered  by  the  distance  of  the  plant  from  residences  such  that  ambient  sound  level 
should  not  increase  appreciably.  Noise  levels  are  anticipated  to  be  less  than  65  dBA  at  the 
nearest  noise-sensitive  receptor.  Therefore,  the  review  team  determines  there  is  no 
noise-related  pathway  by  which  minority  or  low-income  populations  of  interest  could  receive  a 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impact. 

5. 5. 2. 5  Summary  of  Physical  and  Environmental  Impacts 

The  review  team’s  investigation  and  outreach  did  not  identify  any  unique  characteristics  or 
practices  among  minority  or  low-income  populations  that  might  result  in  physical  or 
environmental  impacts  that  would  be  different  from  those  on  the  general  population. 

As  discussed  in  Section  2.6,  most  of  the  census  block  groups  classified  as  minority  or 
low-income  are  located  across  the  Delaware  River  in  New  Castle  County.  The  closest  block 
groups  to  the  PSEG  Site  are  about  8  mi  north  of  the  site  in  the  City  of  Salem.  The  census  block 


NUREG-2168 


5-64 


November  2015 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


groups  would  not  be  affected  by  any  physical  or  environmental  impacts  because  of  their 
distance  from  the  site. 

Based  on  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review,  the  review 
team  found  no  pathways  from  soil,  water,  air,  and  noise  that  would  lead  to  disproportionately 
high  and  adverse  impacts  on  minority  or  low-income  populations. 

5.5.3  Socioeconomic  Impacts 

Socioeconomic  impacts  (discussed  in  Section  5.4)  were  reviewed  to  evaluate  whether  there 
would  be  any  operational  activities  that  could  have  a  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impact 
on  minority  or  low-income  populations.  Except  for  adverse  effects  on  recreational  resources,  all 
adverse  socioeconomic  impacts  associated  with  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  expected  to 
be  SMALL  for  the  general  public.  The  review  team  found  that  there  could  be  adverse 
MODERATE  impacts  on  recreational  resources;  however,  these  impacts  are  not  expected  to 
disproportionately  affect  the  nearby  low-income  and  minority  populations. 

5.5.4  Subsistence  and  Special  Conditions 

NRC’s  environmental  justice  methodology  includes  an  assessment  of  populations  with  unique 
characteristics,  such  as  minority  communities  exceptionally  dependent  on  subsistence 
resources  or  identifiable  in  compact  locations,  such  as  Native  American  settlements  or 
high-density  concentrations  of  minority  populations. 

5. 5. 4. 7  Subsistence 

Access  to  the  PSEG  Site  is  restricted,  so  there  are  no  plant-gathering,  hunting,  or  fishing 
activities  at  the  site.  PSEG  and  the  review  team  independently  interviewed  community  leaders 
in  Salem  County  and  New  Castle  County  and  found  that  no  such  practices  were  identified  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  There  is  no  documented  subsistence  fishing  in  the  Delaware  River, 
and  all  hunting,  plant-gathering,  and  fishing  near  the  PSEG  Site  is  done  for  recreational 
purposes  (Section  2.6.3). 

From  the  information  provided  by  PSEG,  interviews  with  local  officials,  and  the  review  team’s 
independent  evaluation,  the  review  team  concludes  that  there  would  be  no  operations-related 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  on  subsistence  activities  on  minority  or  low-income 
populations. 

5. 5. 4. 2  High-Density  Communities 

As  discussed  in  Section  2.6.3,  there  are  no  high-density  communities  in  Elsinboro  and  Lower 
Alloways  Creek  Townships.  There  are  two  public  housing  projects  in  Penns  Grove  and  three  in 
Salem  City.  From  its  own  independent  evaluation  and  interaction  with  local  officials,  the  review 
team  does  not  predict  any  impacts  to  the  communities  in  Penns  Grove  because  of  its  distance 
from  the  site  and  because  no  pathways  exist  for  adverse  impacts.

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


5.5.5  Migrant  Labor 

As  discussed  in  Section  2.6.3,  the  main  migrant  populations  closest  to  the  site  are  the  HCGS 
and  SGS  outage  workforces.  Farm  workers  in  the  economic  impact  area  are  located  closer  to 
or  in  Gloucester  and  Cumberland  Counties  and  not  near  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  from  the 
information  provided  by  PSEG,  interviews  with  local  officials,  and  the  review  team’s  independent 
evaluation,  the  review  team  concludes  that  there  would  be  no  disproportionately  high  and 
adverse  impacts  on  migrant  laborers. 

5.5.6  Summary  of  Environmental  Justice  Impacts 

The  review  team  evaluated  the  proposed  operations  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  on 
environmental  justice  populations.  The  review  team  did  not  identify  any  potential  environmental 
pathways  by  which  the  identified  minority  or  low-income  populations  in  the  50-mi  region  and 
economic  impact  area  would  likely  experience  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  human 
health,  environmental,  physical,  or  socioeconomic  effects  as  a  result  of  operations  activities. 

5.6  Historic  and  Cultural  Resources 

Operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  has  the  potential  to  affect  historic  and 
cultural  resources.  Impact  levels  from  operation  are  dependent  on  the  resources  present. 
Section  2.7  describes  the  historic  and  cultural  resources  found  in  the  vicinity  of  the  project  area. 
Section  4.6  describes  the  effects  from  building  activities  on  historic  and  cultural  resources  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Both  the  NRC  and  the  USACE  are  responsible  for  considering  the 
effects  of  the  project  on  historic  and  cultural  resources.  The  NRC  is  responsible  for  any  effects 
to  historic  and  cultural  resources  that  could  occur  on  Artificial  Island  and  that  would  result  from 
the  visual  intrusion  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  The  USACE  is  responsible  for  effects  from 
any  required  dredging  and  the  construction  of  a  new  causeway  linking  Artificial  Island  to  Money 
Island.  No  impacts  to  historic  and  cultural  resources  are  expected  from  any  dredging  activities; 
however,  the  USACE  has  yet  to  make  its  effects  determination  on  this  aspect  of  the  project 
(NJDEP  2013-TN2742).  Consultation  is  ongoing  for  the  Money  Island  (i.e. ,  causeway)  and 
dredging  area  aspects  of  the  project.  In  most  cases,  any  impacts  to  historic  and  cultural 
resources  would  occur  during  building  when  most  ground-disturbing  activities,  which  pose  the 
main  threat  to  these  resources,  would  take  place.  Operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
would  not  be  expected  to  further  affect  these  resources. 

Operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  could  affect  the  viewshed  of  historic 
architectural  resources  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site  that  are  listed  in  or  eligible  for  listing  in  the 
National  Register  of  Historic  Places.  As  discussed  in  Section  2.7,  there  are  29  architectural 
resources  of  concern  in  line  of  sight  within  4.9  mi  of  the  project  area  (MACTEC  2009-TN2543; 
AKRF  2012-TN2876;  AKRF  2015-TN4287).  It  is  anticipated  that  operation  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  that  includes  two  NDCTs  (if  selected)  would  affect  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson 
House  National  Historic  Landmark  (NHL),  and  the  properties  at  349  Fort  Elfborg-Hancock 
Bridge  Road  and  116  Mason  Point  Road.  Even  though  the  proposed  project  is  over  4  mi  from 
the  NHL  and  other  historic  properties,  and  the  visibility  of  the  NDCTs  is  dependent  on  climatic 
conditions,  which  could  obscure  them  (see  Figure  2-30  and  2-31  in  Section  2-7),  the  visual 
impact  would  remain  noticeable.  In  addition  to  the  proposed  NDCTs,  vapor  plumes  from  the 


NUREG-2168 


5-66 


November  2015 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


towers  would  be  visible  during  plant  operations.  The  introduction  of  additional  plumes  would, 
however,  be  consistent  with  the  current  setting,  which  includes  the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS 
facilities  and  therefore  would  not  contribute  to  the  visual  adverse  effect.  Further  discussion  of 
the  visual  effects  from  the  new  plumes  is  provided  in  Section  5. 4. 1.6.  The  Delaware  State 
Historic  Preservation  Office  (SHPO)  concurred  that  no  historic  properties  in  Delaware  would  be 
visually  affected  by  the  project  (DDHCA  2013-TN2639).  In  December  2014,  the  New  Jersey 
SHPO  issued  a  new  opinion  that  the  ESP  could  result  in  an  adverse  visual  effect  to  the  Abel 
and  Mary  Nicholson  House  NHL  (NJDEP  2014-TN4288). 

No  traditional  cultural  properties  of  significance  to  Native  American  tribes  have  been  identified  in 
the  vicinity  of  the  project  area.  See  Section  2.7.3  for  additional  information  about  consultation 
with  Native  American  tribes. 

As  discussed  in  Section  4.6,  impacts  to  archaeological  resources  are  not  expected  to  occur  as  a 
result  of  NRC  authorized  activities.  In  the  event  that  significant  historic  and  cultural  resources 
were  encountered  during  operations,  PSEG  maintains  procedure  EN-AA-602-0006  for 
considering  cultural  resources  during  operations  (PSEG  2012-TN2557).  Operations  are 
expected  to  have  an  indirect  visual  adverse  effect  on  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House  NHL 
(127  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road,  Elsinboro  Township),  and  the  historic  properties  at 
349  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road  and  at  116  Mason  Point  Road  (NRC  2015-TN4291), 
which  are  all  in  New  Jersey,  if  NDCTs  are  selected.  No  historic  properties  would  be  affected  by 
operations  in  Delaware  (DDHCA  201 3-TN2639).  For  the  purposes  of  the  review  team’s  NEPA 
analysis,  based  on  (1)  no  known  significant  resources  on  Artificial  Island,  (2)  the  review  team’s 
cultural  resource  analysis,  (3)  PSEG’s  procedure  for  inadvertent  discovery  of  archaeological 
resources,  and  (4)  consultation  with  the  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  SHPOs,  the  review  team 
concludes  the  potential  indirect  visual  adverse  effect  could  result  from  operations  in  New 
Jersey.  Because  the  impact  is  indirect  and  can  be  mitigated  the  overall  NEPA  impacts  on 
historic  and  cultural  resources  are  expected  to  be  SMALL  to  MODERATE.  This  range  results 
from  the  fact  that  the  visual  effect  on  historic  properties  is  variable  and  influenced  by  climatic 
conditions  but  would  remain  noticeable  if  NDCTs  were  built.  If  mechanical  draft  cooling  towers 
were  selected  as  the  cooling  system,  there  would  be  no  impact  to  historic  properties.  Section 
106  consultation  for  the  NRC’s  portion  of  the  proposed  project  was  completed  by  the  execution 
of  the  Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA)  on  October  14,  2015  (NRC  2015-TN4377).  A  copy  of 
the  final  MOA  is  provided  within  Appendix  F.  . 

5.7  Meteorology  and  Air  Quality  Impacts 

The  primary  impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  on  local 
meteorology  and  air  quality  would  be  from  CWS  releases  to  the  environment  of  heat  and 
moisture  from  the  primary  cooling  system,  operation  of  auxiliary  equipment  (e.g.,  generators 
and  auxiliary  boilers),  and  mobile  emissions  (e.g.,  worker  vehicles).  Section  5.7.1  discusses 
potential  air-quality  impacts  from  nonradioactive  effluent  releases  from  the  PSEG  Site.  The 
potential  impacts  of  releases  from  operating  the  cooling  system  are  discussed  in  Section  5.7.2. 
Section  5.7.3  discusses  the  potential  air-quality  impacts  associated  with  transmission  lines 
during  plant  operation.

NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


5.7.1  Air-Quality  Impacts 

Section  2.9  describes  the  meteorological  characteristics  and  air  quality  of  the  PSEG  Site. 

Based  on  PSEG’s  plant  parameter  envelope  (PPE),  sources  of  air  emissions  would  include 
stationary  combustion  sources  (auxiliary  boilers,  four  emergency  diesel  generators,  two  regular 
diesel  generators,  and/or  six  gas  turbines),  cooling  towers  (one  or  two  natural  draft,  mechanical 
draft,  or  fan-assisted  natural  draft  wet  cooling  towers  and  smaller  mechanical  draft  cooling 
towers  for  SWS  cooling)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  and  mobile  sources  (worker  vehicles,  onsite 
heavy  equipment  and  support  vehicles,  and  delivery  of  materials  and  disposal  of  wastes). 
Stationary  combustion  sources  would  operate  only  for  limited  periods,  often  for  periodic 
maintenance  testing. 

5.7. 7.7  Criteria  Pollutants 

The  principal  air  emission  sources  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  be  cooling  towers,  auxiliary  boilers  for  heating  and  startup,  engine-driven  emergency 
equipment,  and  emergency  power  supply  system  diesel  generators  and/or  gas  turbines.  Based 
on  the  PPE  bounding  assumptions  (Appendix  I),  the  new  plant  would  have  six  backup 
generators  (four  emergency  diesel  generators  and  two  normal  diesel  generators)  and/or  six  gas 
turbines  as  part  of  the  emergency  power  supply  system.  The  anticipated  annual  auxiliary  boiler 
and  diesel  generator/gas  turbine  air  emissions,  which  include  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx),  carbon 
monoxide  (CO),  sulfur  oxides  (SOx),  hydrocarbons  in  the  form  of  volatile  organic  compounds 
(VOCs),  and  particulate  matter,  are  provided  in  Table  5-13.  Operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  would  increase  gaseous  and  particulate  emissions  to  the  air  by  a  small  amount,  primarily 
from  equipment  associated  with  auxiliary  systems  and  the  cooling  towers.  The  primary  sources 
of  emissions  from  auxiliary  systems  would  be  the  auxiliary  boilers,  standby  power  units  such  as 
diesel  generators  or  gas  turbines,  and  engine-driven  emergency  equipment.  The  auxiliary 
boilers  would  be  used  for  heating  buildings  associated  with  the  new  plant,  primarily  during  the 
winter  months,  and  for  process  steam  during  site  startups.  The  diesel  generators/gas  turbines 
and  engine-driven  emergency  equipment  would  be  used  intermittently  and  for  brief  durations 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  ' 

Low-sulfur  fuels  would  be  used  for  all  equipment,  minimizing  gaseous  and  particulate  emissions 
during  the  periods  when  the  equipment  operates.  The  cooling  towers  would  be  the  primary 
source  of  particulate  emissions  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Table  5-13  presents  PSEG’s  estimated  annual  nonradiological  emissions  associated  with 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  As  discussed  in  Section  2.9.2,  Salem 
County  is  in  a  nonattainment  area  for  the  8-hour  ozone  (O3)  National  Ambient  Air  Quality 
Standards  (NAAQSs,  40  CFR  81.331  [TN255]),  so  the  General  Conformity  Rule  (40  CFR  Part 
93,  Subpart  B  [TN2495])  applies.  The  primary  precursors  to  O3  are  NOx  and  VOCs.  New 
Jersey  is  located  inside  the  Northeast  Ozone  Transport  Region.  For  ozone  and  its  precursors  in 
states  within  the  Northeast  Ozone  Transport  Region,  such  as  New  Jersey,  the  applicable  40 
CFR  93.153(b)(1)  de  minimis  rates  (40  CFR  Part  93,  Subpart  B,  [TN2495])  are  100  tons  per 
year  (tpy)  for  NOxand  50  tpy  for  VOCs.  The  estimated  annual  NOx  emissions  in  Table  5-13  are 
57.3  tpy,  well  below  the  100  tpy  de  minimis  rate.  The  estimated  annual  VOC  emissions  are  202 
tpy,  significantly  larger  than  the  40  CFR  93.153(b)(1)  de  minimis  rate  (40  CFR  93,  Subpart  B, 


NUREG-2168

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


[TN2495]).  However,  the  CAA  regulations  at  40  CFR  93.153(d)(1)  state  that,  notwithstanding 
the  other  requirements  of  40  CFR  Part  93  (TN2495),  a  conformity  determination  is  not  required 
for  a  Federal  action  (or  portion  thereof)  that  includes  major  or  minor  new  or  modified  stationary 
sources  that  require  a  permit  under  the  New  Source  Review  (NSR)  program  or  the  Prevention 
of  Significant  Deterioration  (PSD)  program.  Therefore,  the  NRC  has  determined  that  it  is  not 
required  to  consider  the  NOx  and  VOC  emissions  from  the  operation  of  PSEG  in  the  applicability 
analysis  and  conformity  determination.  At  the  COL  stage,  the  NRC  staff  will  need  to 
demonstrate  conformity  with  the  applicable  state  implementation  plan  according  to  40  CFR 
93.150  to  comply  with  the  General  Conformity  Rule  (40  CFR  Part  93,  Subpart  B  [TN2495]). 
Because  the  ESP  does  not  authorize  the  activities  that  would  lead  to  these  emissions,  the 
General  Conformity  Rule  is  not  addressed  at  this  time. 

Air  emission  sources  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  managed  in 
accordance  with  Federal,  State,  and  local  air-quality  control  laws  and  regulations.  A  new  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  would  comply  with  all  regulatory  requirements  of  the  CAA.  including  requirements 
of  the  NJDEP  Division  of  Air  Quality,  thereby  minimizing  any  impacts  on  state  and  regional  air 
quality.  Modifications  to  the  SGS  and  HCGS  Title  V  Operating  Permit  under  the  CAA  from  the 
NJDEP  would  be  required  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  addressing  emissions 
and  compliance  with  State  and  Federal  regulations  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

The  EPA  revised  the  8-hour  ozone  NAAQS  on  March  27,  2008  (73  FR  16436-TN3337).  The 
primary  8-hour  ozone  standard  was  lowered  from  0.080  ppm  to  0.075  ppm.  The  secondary 
standard  was  also  strengthened  to  make  it  identical  to  the  revised  primary  standard.  New 
Jersey  submitted  recommendations  for  designating  nonattainment  areas  for  the  2008  revised 
ozone  standard  to  EPA  on  April  1,  2009.  On  January  6,  2010,  EPA  proposed  to  strengthen  the 
8-hour  ozone  NAAQS  set  in  March  2008.  EPA  is  proposing  to  strengthen  the  8-hour  "primary” 
ozone  standard,  designed  to  protect  public  health,  to  a  level  within  the  range  of  0.060  to 
0.070  ppm.

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


New  or  modified  sources  of  air  pollution  must  undergo  an  NSR  before  construction  and  obtain  a 
Title  V  operating  permit  if  they  emit  or  have  the  potential  to  emit  (PTE)  more  than  the  threshold 
values  in  NJAC  Title  7,  Chapter  27  (NJAC  7:127-TN3290)  for  criteria  air  pollutants.  Stationary 
equipment  such  as  diesel  generators  and  auxiliary  boilers  would  be  required  to  comply  with  the 
requirements  of  the  “National  Emission  Standards  for  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants  for  Source 
Categories”  given  in  40  CFR  Part  63  (TN1403).  These  regulations  specify  emission  limits  and, 
for  nonemergency  diesels,  performance  tests,  limitations  on  fuel  sulfur  content,  and  operating 
limitations.  In  addition,  depending  on  when  the  engines  are  built  and  installed,  there  may  be 
additional  requirements  under  the  “Standards  of  Performance  for  Stationary  Compression 
Ignition  Internal  Combustion  Engines”  (40  CFR  60,  Subpart  llll,  [TNI 020]).  These  Federal 
requirements  would  be  administered  by  the  State  and  included  in  the  Title  V  operating  permit. 
Given  the  small  size  and  infrequent  operation  of  combustion  equipment,  impacts  on  offsite  air 
quality  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

Additional  operations-related  traffic  would  also  result  in  vehicular  air  emissions.  Of  particular 
concern  is  NOx  because  it  contributes  to  ozone  formation,  and  Salem  County  is  in  an  8-hour 
ozone  nonattainment  area.  Nominal  localized  increases  in  emissions  would  occur  due  to  the 
increased  numbers  of  cars,  trucks,  and  delivery  vehicles  that  would  travel  to  and  from  the  ESP 
site.  Most  of  the  increased  traffic  would  be  associated  with  employees  driving  to  and  from  work. 
Once  the  workers  are  at  the  site,  the  volume  of  traffic  and  its  associated  emissions  is  expected 
to  decrease.  The  workforce  would  also  be  staggered  in  shifts,  which  would  further  reduce  the 
amount  of  traffic  during  peak  traffic  times  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Therefore,  impacts  to  local 
and  regional  air  quality  from  operations-related  traffic  would  be  minimal. 

Fugitive  dust  is  expected  to  be  generated  during  operation.  However,  dust  suppression 
methods  could  minimize  impacts  from  fugitive  dust.  These  include  watering  exposed  areas, 
reseeding,  or  stabilizing  areas  after  construction  activities  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

The  closest  mandatory  Class  I  Federal  area  where  visibility  is  an  important  value  is  the 
Brigantine  Wilderness  Area  at  the  Edwin  B.  Forsythe  National  Wildlife  Refuge  north  of 
Brigantine,  New  Jersey  (40  CFR  81.420  [TN255]),  approximately  60  miles  east  of  the  PSEG 
Site.  Considering  the  distance  to  the  Class  I  area,  which  is  not  downwind  of  prevailing  winds  at 
the  site,  and  the  minor  air  emissions  from  the  PSEG  Site,  there  is  little  likelihood  that  activities  at 
the  PSEG  Site  could  adversely  affect  air  quality  and  air-quality-related  values  (e.g.,  visibility  or 
acid  deposition)  in  this  Class  I  area. 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  evaluation,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  air-quality  impacts  of  criteria  pollutants  would  not  be  noticeable, 
and  additional  mitigation  would  not  be  warranted,  given  PSEG’s  commitment  to  manage  and 
mitigate  emissions  in  accordance  with  applicable  regulations. 

5. 7. 1.2  Greenhouse  Gases 

Operating  a  nuclear  power  plant  involves  the  emission  of  some  greenhouse  gases  (GHGs), 
primarily  carbon  dioxide  (C02).  The  review  team  has  estimated  that  the  total  GHG  footprint  for 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  for  40  years  is  on  the  order  of  634,000 
metric  tons  (MT)  of  C02  equivalent  (C02e,  an  emission  rate  of  about  1 5,850  MT  C02e  annually,

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


averaged  over  the  period  of  operation).  This  amounts  to  about  0.01 1  percent  of  the  total 
projected  GHG  emissions  estimate  in  New  Jersey  of  143,400,000  MT  of  gross  C02e  in  2010 
(NJDEP  2008-TN2776).  This  also  equates  to  about  0.0002  percent  of  the  total  United  States 
annual  emission  rate  of  6.7  billion  MT  C02e  in  201 1  (EPA  201 3-TN281 5).  The  value  of 
634,000  MT  C02e  includes  the  emissions  from  a  nuclear  power  plant  operating  (362,000  MT 
C02e)  and  the  associated  emissions  from  the  operations  workforce  (272,000  MT  C02e).  These 
estimates  are  based  on  GHG  footprint  estimates  in  Appendix  K. 

The  EPA  promulgated  the  PSD  requirements  and  the  Title  V  GHG  Tailoring  Rule  on  June  3, 
2010  (75  FR  31 514-TN1404).  This  rule  states  that,  among  other  items,  new  and  existing 
sources  not  already  subject  to  a  Title  V  permit,  or  that  have  a  PTE  at  least  100,000  tpy  (or 
75,000  tpy  for  modifications  at  existing  facilities)  C02e,  will  become  subject  to  the  PSD  and  Title 
V  requirements  effective  July  1 , 201 1 .  The  rule  also  states  that  sources  with  a  PTE  below 
50,000  tpy  C02e  will  not  be  subject  to  PSD  or  Title  V  permitting  before  April  30,  2016.  EPA  may 
decide  not  to  require  permits  for  sources  with  GHG  emissions  less  than  50,000  tpy.  Based  on 
the  review  team’s  estimate  of  1 5,850  MT  C02e  emitted  annually  from  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  PSEG  would  fit  into  the  category  of  smaller  sources  that 
are  subject  to  permitting  after  April  30,  2016,  or  may  be  exempt  from  permitting  (EPA  2014- 
TN2497). 

Based  on  its  assessment  of  the  plant  operations’  GHG  footprint  when  compared  with  annual 
GHG  emissions  for  New  Jersey  and  the  United  States,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the 
atmospheric  impacts  of  GHGs  from  plant  operations  would  not  be  noticeable,  and  additional 
mitigation  would  not  be  warranted. 

5.7.2  Cooling  System  Impacts 

The  proposed  cooling  systems  for  the  CWS  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  one  of  three  different 
closed-loop  evaporative  (wet)  designs:  mechanical  draft,  natural  draft,  or  fan-assisted  natural 
draft  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  For  this  impact  analysis,  the  first  two  designs  are  evaluated,  and 
the  impacts  of  the  last  design  are  considered  to  be  bounded  by  the  impacts  of  the  first  two 
designs.  The  mechanical  draft  design  consists  of  two  LMDCTs,  each  with  a  tower  length,  width, 
and  height  of  817  ft,  100  ft,  and  46  ft,  respectively.  Each  LMDCT  has  34  cells  with  a  cell 
diameter  of  31 .6  ft.  The  natural  draft  design  consists  of  two  NDCTs,  each  with  a  tower  height 
and  diameter  of  590  and  242  ft,  respectively.  In  addition,  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  would 
use  four  smaller  essential  SWS/UHS  cooling  towers;  the  heat  dissipated  by  these  towers  would 
be  an  order  of  magnitude  less  than  that  dissipated  by  cooling  towers  for  the  CWS.  Accordingly, 
impacts  from  the  SWS/UHS  cooling  towers  are  not  considered  further  in  the  analysis  because 
they  have  a  considerably  smaller  impact  than  the  CWS  cooling  towers. 

The  proposed  cooling  towers  would  remove  excess  heat  by  evaporating  water.  Upon  exiting 
the  tower,  water  vapor  would  mix  with  the  surrounding  air,  and  this  process  would  generally  lead 
to  condensation  and  formation  of  a  visible  plume,  which  would  have  aesthetic  impacts.  Other 
meteorological  and  atmospheric  impacts  include  ground-level  fogging/icing,  plume  shadowing, 
drift  deposition  from  dissolved  salts  and  chemicals  found  in  the  cooling  water,  and  ground-level 
temperature  and  humidity  increases.  In  addition,  plumes  from  the  cooling  towers  could  interact 
cumulatively  with  emissions  from  other  sources  and  the  existing  HCGS  cooling  tower.

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


The  Electric  Power  Research  Institute’s  SACTI  prediction  computer  code  was  used  to  estimate 
potential  seasonal  and  annual  impacts  associated  with  operating  the  proposed  cooling  towers 
(EPRI  1987-TN3335).  Site-specific,  tower-specific,  and  circulating-water-specific  engineering 
data  were  used  as  input  to  the  SACTI  model.  Three  years  (2006-2008)  of  onsite 
meteorological  data  combined  with  cloud  data  (such  as  cloud  cover  and  ceiling  heights)  from 
nearby  New  Castle  County  Airport  in  Wilmington,  Delaware,  and  mixing  height  data  from  the 
Dulles  International  Airport  in  Sterling,  Virginia,  which  is  the  closest  representative  upper-air 
station,  were  used  in  the  analysis  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2014-TN3334).  The  source  of 
cooling  water  for  these  towers  is  brackish  water  from  the  Delaware  River.  The  TDS  value  of 
12,900  mg/L  (or  12,900  ppm)  is  conservatively  assumed  for  the  analysis,  although  the  highest 
measured  mean  TDS  value  in  the  river  is  6,280  mg/L  (or  6,280  ppm).  As  cooling  water 
continues  to  evaporate  from  the  towers  or  be  lost  via  drift,  the  concentration  of  minerals  in  the 
water  increases,  which  can  lead  to  scaling  and  corrosive  conditions.  To  control  TDS  levels,  the 
portion  of  the  circulating  water  should  be  blown  down.  Because  of  the  use  of  brackish  water,  a 
lower  cycle  of  concentration  (1.5),  defined  as  the  ratio  of  TDS  concentration  in  the  circulating 
water  compared  to  the  raw  makeup  water,  is  assumed.  Both  the  mechanical  and  natural  draft 
designs  would  be  equipped  with  high-efficiency  drift  eliminators,  which  significantly  reduce 
particulate  matter  (PM)  emissions  (especially  larger  PM)  and,  thereby,  salt  deposition  around 
the  site.  Detailed  model  input  data  to  SACTI  for  LMDCTs  and  NDCTs  are  presented  in  ER 
Tables  5.3-5  and  5.3-6  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  SACTI  modeling  results  for  visible  plumes, 
ground-level  fogging/icing,  plume  shadowing,  and  salt  deposition  are  presented,  which  are 
made  by  the  applicant  and  confirmed  by  the  staffs  independent  analysis. 

Both  ground-level  temperature  and  humidity  would  increase  in  the  vicinity  of  the  warm  and 
humid  cooling  tower  plumes.  However,  any  increases  in  ground-level  temperature  and  humidity 
would  be  localized  and  short-lived  as  the  plume,  reaching  a  considerable  height,  disperses  and 
mixes  with  the  far  larger  volume  of  surrounding  air,  and  thus  ground-level  temperature  and 
humidity  increases  are  not  considered  further. 

5. 7.2. 7  Visible  Plumes 

Results  from  the  SACTI  analysis,  as  reported  by  PSEG  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2014- 
TN3334),  indicate  that  the  largest  frequency  of  visible  plume  occurrence  is  on  the  site.  For 
comparison,  the  nearest  plant  boundary  is  1 ,100  ft  from  the  center  of  the  tower  area.  On  an 
annual  basis,  SACTI  predicts  that  the  plume  lengths  from  the  LMDCTs  would  be  less  than 
1 ,969  ft  for  about  half  of  the  time  and  that  the  most  frequent  occurrences  would  be  9.5  percent 
of  the  time  (or  831  hr/yr)  at  328  ft  southeast  of  the  LMDCTs.  The  highest  probability  of  a  visible 
plume  near  the  nearest  plant  boundary  would  be  about  5.7  percent  of  the  time  (or  499  hr/yr)  at 
984  ft  north  of  the  LMDCTs.  By  season,  the  most  frequent  occurrence  is  predicted  during  the 
winter:  14.0  percent  of  the  time  (or  302  hr/yr)  at  328  ft  southeast  of  the  LMDCT  and  1 1 .9 
percent  of  the  time  (or  257  hr/yr)  at  984  ft  southeast  of  the  LMDCTs.  The  visible  plume 
frequency  would  be  reduced  with  increasing  distance  from  the  towers.  The  visible  plume  would 
extend  to  a  distance  of  1 ,640  ft  with  an  average  of  278  hr/yr  and  to  a  distance  of  3,281  ft  with  an 
average  of  179  hr/yr.  In  general,  the  visible  plumes  from  the  NDCTs  could  be  seen  more 
frequently  than  those  from  the  LMDCT  at  downwind  locations.  On  an  annual  basis,  SACTI 
predicts  that  the  plume  lengths  from  the  NDCTs  would  be  less  than  3,281  ft  about  half  of  the 
time  and  that  the  most  frequent  occurrences  would  be  about  9.5  percent  of  the  time  (or 


NUREG-2168 


5-72 


November  2015 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


831  hr/yr)  up  to  984  ft  southeast  of  the  NDCTs.  Of  these  occurrences,  the  most  frequent 
occurrence  is  predicted  during  the  winter,  14.0  percent  of  the  time  (or  302  hr/yr)  at  up  to  1,640  ft 
southeast  of  the  NDCTs.  The  visible  plume  would  extend  to  a  distance  of  1 ,640  ft  with  an 
average  of  499  hr/yr  and  to  a  distance  of  3,281  ft  with  an  average  of  282  hr/yr. 

Considering  the  physical  tower  heights,  the  visible  plume  could  reach  a  height  of  at  least 
112  and  820  ft  above  ground  level  for  the  LMDCTs  and  NDCTs,  respectively  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280;  PSEG  2014-TN3334).  On  an  annual  basis,  the  median  plume  height  for  the  LMDCTs 
would  be  about  702  ft,  while  that  for  the  NDCTs  would  be  about  1 ,574  ft.  Due  to  the  greater 
release  height  of  the  plumes,  the  NDCT  plumes  would  achieve  a  greater  height  above  ground 
level  than  the  LMDCT  plumes. 

The  visible  plume  frequencies  discussed  above  include  nighttime  hours  when  plumes  may 
not  be  perceived.  Thus,  cooling  tower  plumes  would  be  seen  less  frequently  than  the 
aforementioned  values,  considering  daytime  hours  only.  The  frequency  of  occurrence  of  long 
cooling  tower  plumes  from  either  LMDCTs  or  NDCTs  in  a  given  direction  is  predicted  to  be  low. 
Given  the  limited  elevations  and  extent  of  the  visible  plumes  from  both  designs,  any  associated 
impacts  would  be  minor  and  would  not  warrant  mitigation. 

5. 7. 2. 2  Ground  Fogging  and  Icing 

Ground-level  fogging  occurs  when  a  visible  plume  from  a  cooling  tower  contacts  the  ground.  In 
general,  fogging  is  predicted  to  occur  more  frequently  in  non-summer  months.  A  large  majority 
of  fogging  is  predicted  to  occur  within  the  PSEG  Site  boundary.  On  an  annual  basis,  fogging 
could  extend  up  to  3,609  ft  east-southeast  of  the  LMDCTs,  and  maximum  fogging  duration 
would  be  7  hours  at  1,312  ft  northwest  of  the  LMDCTs  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2014- 
TN3334).  On  a  seasonal  basis,  maximum  fogging  durations  and  distances  from  the  LMDCTs 
are  2.7  hours  at  656  ft  northwest  in  winter,  5.5  hours  at  656  ft  west-southwest  in  spring,  and  3.0 
hours  between  1 ,312  and  1 ,640  ft  northwest  in  fall.  No  fogging  is  predicted  to  occur  during  the 
summer.  As  discussed  in  Section  2.9.1,  the  prevailing  wind  direction  is  from  the  northwest,  but 
fogging  occurs  more  frequently  to  the  west,  which  suggests  that  meteorological  conditions 
conducive  to  fogging  are  associated  with  winds  from  the  east  and  southeast  (i.e. ,  the  Atlantic 
Ocean  and  Delaware  Bay).  As  a  consequence,  fogging  events  would  be  infrequent,  and  most 
fogging  events  would  be  limited  to  the  PSEG  Site,  which  would  not  significantly  affect  roadway 
conditions  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site  or  commercial  shipping  traffic  on  the  Delaware  River.  Icing 
may  occur  when  the  cooling  tower  plume  comes  in  contact  with  the  ground  (i.e.,  fogging  occurs) 
at  below-freezing  temperatures.  The  SACTI  model  predicts  that  no  icing  events  would  be 
anticipated  at  any  location  in  any  season,  which  suggests  that  fogging  events  would  not  occur 
during  freezing  conditions. 

Based  on  studies  of  actual  NDCTs,  the  SACTI  model  assumes  that  the  occurrence  of  fogging 
(and  icing)  is  an  insignificant  event  because  of  the  greater  plume  height  of  the  NDCTs  and 
therefore  does  not  estimate  their  occurrence. 

Meteorological  conditions  favoring  natural  fogs  also  favor  cooling  tower  fogging.  Natural  heavy 
fogging  in  the  PSEG  Site  area  occurs  about  26  days  per  year  on  average  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  Any  plume-induced  event  would  thus  be  infrequent  and  likely  to  occur  concurrently 
with  a  natural  fog.  Considering  that  fogging  events  occur  infrequently  and  most  frequently  on 


November  2015 


5-73 


NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


the  site,  and  that  no  icing  impacts  are  predicted,  potential  impacts  of  LMDCT-induced 
fogging/icing  are  anticipated  to  be  negligible  and  would  not  warrant  mitigation. 

5. 7. 2. 3  Plume  Shado  wing 

Plume  shadowing  from  cooling  tower  plumes  is  predicted  by  the  SACTI  model  by  calculating  the 
average  number  of  hours  the  visible  plume  would  shadow  the  ground.  Most  of  the  plume 
shadowing  would  occur  within  656  ft  of  the  towers  for  2,830  hr/yr  for  LMDCTs  and  1 ,658  hr/yr 
for  NDCTs  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2014-TN3334).  Plume  shadowing  frequency 
decreases  rapidly  with  increasing  distances.  Plume  shadowing  frequency  decreases  to  1 ,098 
hr/yr  at  1 ,312  and  345  hr/yr  at  3,281  ft  for  the  LMDCTs.  Similarly,  it  decreases  to  1,117  hr/yr  at 
1 ,312  and  412  hr/yr  at  3,281  ft  for  the  NDCTs.  Beyond  9,843  ft,  the  average  plume  shadowing 
frequency  would  be  less  than  145  hours  per  year,  about  3.3  percent  of  the  4,380  daylight  hours, 
which  would  be  insignificant  in  terms  of  effects  on  agricultural  production.  Given  the  limited 
agricultural  activities  around  the  PSEG  Site,  the  impacts  of  plume  shadowing  are  expected  to  be 
minor  and  would  not  require  mitigation. 

5. 7. 2. 4  Salt  Deposition 

The  NDCT  would  use  high-efficiency  drift  eliminators  to  minimize  the  loss  of  cooling  water  from 
the  tower  via  drift,  but  some  droplets  still  would  escape  from  the  tower  along  with  the  moving 
airstream  and  would  be  deposited  on  the  ground.  For  LMDCTs,  the  SACTI  model  predicted 
maximum  deposition  rates  of  0.89  (kg/ha/mo  annually  at  2,297  ft  east  of  the  towers 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2014-TN3334).  The  maximum  seasonal  impact  would  occur 
during  the  winter,  with  1 .31  kg/ha/mo  at  2,297  ft  east  of  the  towers,  while  the  minimum  seasonal 
impact  would  occur  during  the  summer,  with  0.56  kg/ha/mo  between  1 ,969  and  2,297  ft  east  of 
the  towers.  These  maximum  impacts  are  below  the  maximum  levels  considered  acceptable  in 
NUREG-1555  (NRC  2000-TN614)  (i.e.,  deposition  of  salt  drift  at  rates  of  1  to  2  kg/ha/mo,  which 
generally  is  not  damaging  to  plants).  The  predicted  deposition  rates  are  well  below  the  level  for 
which  deposition  rates  could  cause  leaf  damage  in  many  species  (i.e.,  approaching  or 
exceeding  10  kg/ha/mo  in  any  month  during  the  growing  season).  In  contrast,  potential  impacts 
from  the  NDCTs  would  be  much  lower,  and  maximum  concentrations  would  occur  farther  than 
those  from  LMDCTs  because  of  the  taller  plume  release  height,  which  is  the  sum  of  physical 
tower  height  and  buoyant  plume  rise  caused  by  a  greater  volume  of  hot  and  humid  effluents. 

For  the  NDCTs,  the  annual  maximum  deposition  rate  of  0.023  kg/ha/mo  is  predicted  to  occur 
between  4,265  and  7,546  ft  north  of  the  towers,  with  a  maximum  seasonal  deposition  of 
0.034  kg/ha/mo  in  winter  and  a  minimum  seasonal  deposition  of  0.024  kg/ha/mo  in  summer. 

The  predicted  deposition  rates  from  the  NDCTs  are  well  below  the  levels  of  concern.  Based  on 
2001  LULC  data  from  the  USGS,  1  percent  of  the  land  within  3  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site  is 
designated  as  medium-  and  high-intensity  developed  land,  while  surface  waters  and  wetlands 
comprise  about  90  percent  of  the  land  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Most  of  the  plant  communities 
within  the  salt  drift  zone  that  would  be  exposed  to  drift  from  the  cooling  towers  consist  of  salt 
marsh  or  brackish  marsh  ecosystems  dominated  by  medium-  to  high-salinity  tolerant  species. 
Thus,  the  impacts  of  salt  deposition  from  the  cooling  towers  on  nearby  vegetation  are  expected 
to  be  minor,  and  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted.

5. 7.2.5  Interaction  with  Other  Pollutant  Sources 

The  existing  HOGS  NDCT  is  located  more  than  0.6  mi  south-southeast  of  the  planned  location 
of  the  cooling  towers  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  plumes  from  the 
HCGS  tower  and  the  PSEG  Site  towers  would  usually  travel  in  parallel,  rather  than  in 
intersecting  directions.  The  potential  cumulative  interaction  of  existing  and  new  cooling  tower 
plumes  is  expected  to  be  insignificant  given  the  large  separation  distance  and  the  fact  that  the 
plumes  would  travel  along  nonintersecting  paths  most  of  the  time. 

Existing  combustion  sources  such  as  diesel  generators  (HCGS)  and  boilers  (SGS)  currently 
operate  infrequently  and  mostly  during  the  winter  months  Combustion  sources  that  would  be 
associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  operate  similarly  for  only 
limited  periods.  With  the  exception  of  particulates,  these  combustion  sources  emit  criteria  air 
pollutants  (such  as  NOX)  sulfur  dioxide  [SO2],  and  CO)  that  are  different  from  those  produced  by 
cooling  towers  (i.e.,  small  amounts  of  PM  as  drift).  Interaction  among  pollutants  emitted  from 
these  sources  and  the  cooling  tower  plumes  would  be  for  only  limited  periods  and  would  not 
have  a  significant  impact  on  air  quality.  Based  on  the  above  considerations  and  the  assumption 
that  cooling  towers  associated  with  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  similar  to  existing  cooling  towers 
used  at  other  nuclear  sites,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cooling  tower  impacts  on  air 
quality  would  be  minimal,  and  additional  mitigation  of  air-quality  impacts  would  not  be 
warranted. 

Conclusion.  As  discussed  above,  the  SACTI  model  predicts  that  potential  impacts  of  plumes 
from  the  cooling  towers  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  limited  primarily  to  the  immediate  onsite 
area  and  just  beyond  the  site  boundary.  The  cooling  towers  proposed  for  the  PSEG  Site  would 
be  equipped  with  high-efficiency  drift  eliminators,  which  are  intended  to  significantly  reduce  PM 
emissions  (especially  larger  PM)  and  salt  deposition.  The  area  around  the  PSEG  Site  is 
relatively  sparsely  populated  and  less  sensitive  to  the  potential  impacts  from  cooling  tower 
operations  (e.g.,  plume  shadowing  or  salt  deposition,  considering  limited  agricultural  activities). 
On  the  basis  of  the  analysis  presented  by  the  applicant  in  its  ER  and  the  staffs  independent 
evaluation  of  that  analysis,  the  staff  concludes  that  atmospheric  impacts  of  cooling  tower 
operation  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL  and  that  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

5.7.3  Transmission  Line  Impacts 

Impacts  of  existing  transmission  lines  on  air  quality  are  addressed  in  the  Generic  Environmental 
Impact  Statement  (GEIS)  for  License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants  ,  Revision  1  (NRC  2013- 
TN2654).  Small  amounts  of  ozone  and  even  smaller  amounts  of  NOx  are  produced  by 
transmission  lines.  The  production  of  these  gases  was  found  to  be  insignificant  for  745-kV 
transmission  lines  (the  largest  lines  in  operation)  and  fora  prototype  1,200-kV  transmission  line. 
In  addition,  it  was  determined  that  potential  mitigation  measures,  such  as  burying  transmission 
lines,  would  be  very  costly  and  would  not  be  warranted. 

There  are  currently  two  500-kV  transmission  lines  leading  to  HCGS,  two  500-kV  transmission 
lines  leading  to  SGS,  and  500-kV  tie  lines  between  the  two  switchyards.  PJM  Interconnection, 
LLC,  (PJM)  identified  the  potential  need  for  an  additional  500-kV  transmission  line  to  resolve 
grid  stability  issues.  The  existing  transmission  line  sizes  and  the  potential  new  offsite  500-kV 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


transmission  line  are  well  within  the  range  of  transmission  lines  evaluated  in  NUREG-1437, 
Revision  1  (NRC  201 3-TN2654).  The  review  team  therefore  concludes  that  air-quality  impacts 
from  the  transmission  lines  would  not  be  noticeable  and  mitigation  would  not  be  warranted. 

5.7.4  Summary 

The  review  team  evaluated  potential  impacts  on  air  quality  associated  with  criteria  pollutants 
and  GHG  emissions  from  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review 
team  also  evaluated  potential  impacts  of  cooling  system  emissions.  In  each  case,  the  review 
team  determined  that  the  impacts  would  be  minimal.  On  this  basis,  the  review  team  concludes 
that  the  impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  air  quality  from  criteria  pollutant 
emissions,  GHG  emissions,  the  cooling  system,  and  transmission  lines  would  be  SMALL  and 
that  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

5.8  Nonradiological  Health  Impacts 

This  section  addresses  the  nonradiological  human  health  impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Health  impacts  on  the  public  from  operation  of  the  cooling 
system,  noise  generated  by  operations,  electromagnetic  fields,  and  transporting  operations  are 
discussed.  Health  impacts  from  the  same  sources  for  workers  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  are 
also  evaluated.  Health  impacts  from  radiological  sources  during  operations  are  discussed  in 
Section  5.9. 

5.8.1  Etiological  Agents 

Operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  result  in  a  thermal  discharge  to 
the  Delaware  River  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Such  discharges  have  the  potential  to  increase  the 
growth  of  etiological  agents,  both  in  the  CWS  and  the  river.  Etiological  agents  include  enteric 
pathogens  (such  as  Salmonella  spp.),  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa ,  thermophilic  fungi,  bacteria 
(such  as  Legionella  spp.),  and  free-living  amoeba  (such  as  Naegleria  fowled  and 
Acanthamoeba  spp.).  These  microorganisms  could  result  in  potentially  serious  human  health 
concerns,  particularly  at  high  exposure  levels.  Available  data  assembled  by  the  U.S.  Centers 
for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  for  the  years  2000  to  2010  were  reviewed  for 
outbreaks  of  legionellosis,  salmonellosis,  or  shigellosis  within  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  and 
in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  (CDC  2002-TN2444;  CDC  2002-TN2438;  CDC  2003-TN2437; 

CDC  2004-TN2435;  CDC  2004-TN2436;  CDC  2005-TN2442;  CDC  2006-TN2445;  CDC  2006- 
TN2441 ;  CDC  2007-TN2440;  CDC  2008-TN2439;  CDC  2008-TN557;  CDC  2013-TN2377;  CDC 
2010-TN2447;  CDC  2011-TN2446;  CDC  2011-TN2448;  CDC  2011-TN558;  CDC  2012- 
TN2378).  Outbreaks  that  occurred  in  Delaware  and  New  Jersey  were  within  the  range  of 
national  trends  in  terms  of  cases  per  populations  of  100,000  and  in  terms  of  total  cases  per 
year;  the  outbreaks  were  associated  with  pools,  spas,  or  lakes.  Additionally,  the  Salem  County 
Department  of  Health  and  the  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  State  health  agencies  have  not 
recorded  any  major  waterborne  disease  outbreaks  in  the  Delaware  River  in  the  proximity  of  the 
PSEG  Site  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

The  CDC  Council  of  State  Territorial  Epidemiologists  Naegleria  Work  Group,  after  reviewing  the 
data  from  different  sources,  identified  121  fatal  cases  of  primary  amebic  meningoencephalitis

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


(PAM,  caused  by  Naegleria  fowleri)  in  the  United  States  from  1937  to  2007;  most  cases 
occurred  in  southern  states  during  the  months  of  July  and  September  (CDC  2013-TN2375;  Neil 
and  Berkelman  2008-TN2735).  No  outbreaks  of  Legionnaires’  disease,  PAM,  or  any  other 
waterborne  diseases  associated  with  HCGS  or  SGS  operations  have  been  reported  in  the  past. 
The  standard  practices  for  operating  cooling  towers  include  adding  biocides  to  the  water  to  limit 
growth  of  microorganisms  inside  the  towers  and  providing  appropriate  protective  equipment  for 
workers  who  enter  the  cooling  towers  for  maintenance  operations.  PSEG  would  use  biocides  to 
reduce  the  levels  of  microbial  populations  in  the  cooling  tower,  condenser  equipment,  and 
facilities  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Chlorination  controls  microbial  growth  in  the  piping  and 
condenser  to  prevent  biofouling  and  microbiological  deposits.  PSEG  policies  and  procedures 
regarding  industrial  hygiene  procedures  for  protection  of  workers  from  thermophilic 
microorganisms  in  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  follow  the  existing  PSEG  maintenance 
procedures  for  SGS  and  HCGS  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Sodium  hypochlorite  solution  also  is 
used  to  control  biofouling,  and  all  blowdown  waters  are  treated  to  comply  with  NJPDES  permit 
requirements  before  discharge  to  the  Delaware  River  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  existing  Delaware  River  water  temperature  conditions  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  and 
the  proposed  discharge  location  are  affected  by  the  presence  of  discharges  from  the  existing 
SGS  and  to  a  lesser  extent  HCGS  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Water  temperature  monitoring  data 
and  thermal  plume  analysis  indicate  that  the  SGS  HDA  envelops  the  HCGS  HDA  and  extends 
northward  along  the  shoreline  well  beyond  the  location  of  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  discharge, 
which  would  extend  only  about  100  ft  into  the  Delaware  River  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  It  is 
assumed  that  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  use  two  cooling  towers  (with  a 
mechanical  draft,  natural  draft,  or  fan-assisted  natural  draft  wet  cooling  tower)  and  would  have  a 
closed-loop  cooling  system  to  reduce  the  temperature  of  water  discharged  to  the  Delaware 
River.  The  thermal  plume  modeling  of  this  discharge  indicates  the  PSEG  Site  thermal  plume 
would  be  contained  within  600  ft  of  the  shoreline.  Consequently,  the  plume  from  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  would  be  contained  within  the  SGS  thermal  plume,  and  the  combined  excess 
temperatures  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  HCGS,  and  SGS  would  be  less  than  the 
maximum  temperature  in  the  existing  SGS  thermal  plume  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  NJDEP  has 
issued  a  discharge  permit  for  SGS  and  determined  that  the  SGS  thermal  plume  does  not  impact 
the  balanced  indigenous  community  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Furthermore,  existing  DRBC 
regulatory  standards  for  thermal  discharges  to  the  Delaware  River  state  that  temperature 
increases  above  ambient  outside  the  permitted  heat  dissipation  area  may  not  exceed  2.2°C 
(4°F)  from  September  to  May  or  0.8°C  (1 ,5°F)  from  June  through  August.  Overall  temperatures 
may  not  exceed  30°C  (86°F)  (72  FR  46931 -TN2736).  The  temperature  of  the  river  water  would 
be  below  the  optimal  temperatures  for  thermophilic  bacteria  to  grow  and  reproduce. 

Study  of  the  PSEG  Site  indicated  the  following: 

•  a  historical  low  incidence  of  diseases  from  etiological  agents  in  Delaware  and  New  Jersey 
associated  with  exposure  to  the  Delaware  River  in  proximity  to  the  PSEG  Site, 

•  a  relatively  small  volume  of  water  discharged  from  the  closed-cycle  cooling  system  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant, 

•  rapid  mixing  that  occurs  within  the  Delaware  River,  and 

•  the  small  size  of  the  heat  dissipation  area.

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


For  these  reasons,  the  review  team  concludes  the  impacts  on  human  health  from  the 
microorganisms,  including  thermophiles,  in  the  Delaware  River  and  the  cooling  towers  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minimal  and  that  mitigation  would  not  be 
warranted. 

5.8.2  Noise 

In  NUREG-1437  (NRC  1996-TN288),  the  NRC  staff  discusses  the  environmental  impacts  of 
noise  at  existing  nuclear  power  plants.  Common  sources  of  noise  from  site  operation  include 
cooling  towers,  transformers,  and  switchyards,  with  intermittent  contributions  from  loud 
speakers  and  auxiliary  equipment  such  as  diesel  generators.  These  noise  sources  are 
discussed  in  this  section. 

The  existing  HCGS  and  SGS  units  use  water  from  the  Delaware  River  to  remove  waste  heat. 
HCGS  has  a  closed-loop  cooling  system  with  an  NDCT,  and  SGS  has  a  once-through  cooling 
water  system  with  condenser  cooling.  A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have 
a  cooling  water  system  with  mechanical  draft,  natural  draft,  or  fan-assisted  NDCTs  with  a 
closed-loop  cooling  system.  Cooling  water  would  be  pumped  from  the  Delaware  River  by  an 
intake  pipeline,  and  blowdown  from  the  cooling  towers  would  be  returned  to  the  river  through  a 
discharge  pipeline  after  the  blowdown  was  mixed  with  other  site  operation  wastewater  and 
passed  through  a  wastewater  treatment  facility  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  main  source  of  continuous  noise  is  anticipated  to  be  the  two  cooling  towers  associated  with 
a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Two  fan-assisted  NDCTs  are  used  as  the  bounding  condition  for 
this  assessment  because  NDCTs  are  taller  than  MDCTs  (590  ft  versus  approximately  46  ft, 
respectively)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  fan-assisted  NDCT  is  a  continuous  noise  source 
during  site  operation  with  an  estimated  noise  emission  of  60  dBA  at  1 ,000  ft.  The  nearest 
PSEG  Site  boundary  is  west  of  the  cooling  towers,  1 , 1 00  ft  from  the  center  of  the  proposed 
cooling  tower  area;  the  next  closest  site  boundary  is  1 , 1 65  ft  to  the  east.  PSEG  also  has 
identified  heating,  ventilation,  and  air-conditioning  systems;  vents;  transformers  and  electrical 
equipment;  transmission  lines;  water  pumps;  material-handling  equipment;  motors;  and  public 
address  systems  as  additional  noise  sources  from  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Noise 
attributed  to  operations-related  truck  and  vehicular  traffic  would  be  intermittent,  primarily  during 
shift  changes. 

Applicable  protective  noise  levels  for  the  PSEG  Site  are  contained  in  NJAC  7:29,  which  includes 
regulatory  limits  on  continuous  noise  levels  at  the  residential  property  line  from  industrial, 
commercial,  public  service,  or  community  service  facilities.  For  continuous  noise  sources,  the 
protective  level  is  65  dBA  during  the  day  and  50  dBA  during  the  night  at  the  residential  property 
line  (NJAC  7:29-TN2732).  The  similar  Delaware  limits  (Part  VII,  Title  7,  Chapter  71  of  the 
Delaware  Code  [7  Del  Admin.  C.  §  1 149-TN3001])  provide  for  a  protective  level  of  65  dBA 
during  the  day  and  55  dBA  during  the  night  for  residential  receptors. 

According  to  NUREG-1437  (NRC  1996-TN288),  noise  levels  below  60  to  65  dBA  as  the 
day-night  average  noise  level  (DNL  or  Ldn)  are  considered  to  be  of  small  significance.  More 
recently,  impacts  of  noise  were  considered  in  NUREG-0586,  Supplement  1  (NRC  2002- 
TN665).  The  criterion  for  assessing  the  level  of  significance  was  not  expressed  in  terms  of 


NUREG-2168

November  2015 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


sound  levels  but  instead  was  based  on  the  effect  of  noise  on  human  activities  and  on 
threatened  and  endangered  species.  The  criterion  in  NUREG-0586,  Supplement  1,  is  stated  as 
follows. 


The  noise  impacts  are  considered  detectable  if  sound  levels  are  sufficiently  high 
to  disrupt  normal  human  activities  on  a  regular  basis.  The  noise  impacts  are 
considered  destabilizing  if  sound  levels  are  sufficiently  high  that  the  affected  area 
is  essentially  unsuitable  for  normal  human  activities,  or  if  the  behavior  or  breeding 
of  a  threatened  and  endangered  species  is  affected.  (NRC  2002-TN665) 

PSEG  conducted  a  baseline  noise  survey  in  2009  for  the  PSEG  Site  and  determined  that  noise 
from  sources  at  HCGS  and  SGS  attenuate  to  levels  that  meet  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  State 
standards  of  65  dBA  for  daytime  at  the  boundary  of  the  PSEG  property  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 
Based  on  the  natural  attenuation  of  noise  levels  over  distance,  noise  levels  for  the  fan-assisted 
NDCTs  for  the  PSEG  Site  are  estimated  at  a  distance  of  10,000  ft.  A  fan-assisted  NDCT  with  a 
noise  emission  level  of  60  dBA  at  1 ,000  ft  has  a  noise  level  of  41  dBA  at  1 0,000  ft.  PSEG 
states  that  the  closest  residences  are  1 4,700  ft  west  and  1 5,900  ft  east  of  the  PSEG  Site 
boundaries  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Thus,  noise  from  onsite  sources  would  attenuate  to  levels 
that  would  meet  the  New  Jersey  nighttime  noise  level  standards  (50  dBA)  at  the  property 
boundary  of  the  nearest  residence. 

The  review  team  concludes  the  impact  of  noise  from  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  would  be  minimal  (depending  on  the  reactor  and  cooling  tower  design  as  well  as 
equipment  choices)  and  that  mitigation  would  not  be  warranted. 

5.8.3  Acute  Effects  of  Electromagnetic  Fields 

Electric  shock  resulting  from  either  direct  access  to  energized  conductors  or  induced  charges  in 
metallic  structures  is  an  example  of  an  acute  effect  from  EMFs  associated  with  transmission 
lines  (NRC  1999-TN289).  Such  acute  effects  are  controlled  and  minimized  by  conformance 
with  National  Electrical  Safety  Code  (NESC)  criteria  and  the  Organization  of  PJM  States,  Inc. 
(OPSI),  which  organizes  the  statutory  regulatory  agencies  in  the  13  states  and  Washington, 

D.C.,  where  PJM  operates  transmission  systems.  The  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  states 
that  if  PJM  determines  that  new  transmission  lines  are  needed  for  additional  capacity  from  the 
PSEG  Site  or  to  support  the  regional  grid,  the  new  lines  would  meet  or  exceed  design 
requirements  set  forth  by  NESC  and  meet  the  Lower  Delaware  Valley  500  kV  Transmission 
Design  Criteria.  Also,  lines  would  meet  USACE  requirements  for  clearance  over  flood  levels 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG  and  PJM  both  have  committed  to  design  new  transmission  lines 
to  meet  present  NESC  criteria,  and  the  NRC  staff  assumes  that  if  new  transmission  lines  are 
needed,  such  lines  would  be  constructed  to  meet  NESC  criteria.  For  these  reasons,  the  review 
team  concludes  the  impact  to  the  public  from  acute  effects  of  EMFs  would  be  minimal,  and 
additional  mitigation  would  not  be  warranted. 

5.8.4  Chronic  Effects  of  Electromagnetic  Fields 

Power  transmission  lines  in  the  United  States  operate  at  60  Hz.  The  EMFs  resulting  from  60-Hz 
power  transmission  lines  fall  under  the  category  of  nonionizing  radiation  and  are  considered  to 


November  2015 


5-79 


NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


be  extremely  low  frequency  (ELF)  EMFs.  Research  on  the  potential  for  chronic  effects  from 
60-Hz  EMFs  from  energized  transmission  lines  was  reviewed  by  the  NRC  and  is  addressed  in 
NUREG-1437  (NRC  1996-TN288).  At  the  time  of  that  review,  research  results  were  not 
conclusive.  The  National  Institute  of  Environmental  Health  Sciences  (NIEHS)  directs  related 
research  through  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  (DOE).  An  NIEHS  report  (NIEHS  1999-TN78) 
contains  the  following  statement. 

The  NIEHS  concludes  that  ELF-EMF  (extremely  low  frequency-electromagnetic 
field)  exposure  cannot  be  recognized  as  entirely  safe  because  of  weak  scientific 
evidence  that  exposure  may  pose  a  leukemia  hazard.  In  our  opinion,  this  finding 
is  insufficient  to  warrant  aggressive  regulatory  concern.  However,  because 
virtually  everyone  in  the  United  States  uses  electricity  and  therefore  is  routinely 
exposed  to  ELF-EMF,  passive  regulatory  action  is  warranted  such  as  a  continued 
emphasis  on  educating  both  the  public  and  the  regulated  community  on  means 
aimed  at  reducing  exposures.  The  NIEHS  does  not  believe  that  other  cancers  or 
non-cancer  health  outcomes  provide  sufficient  evidence  of  a  risk  to  currently 
warrant  concern. 

The  staff  reviewed  available  scientific  literature  on  chronic  effects  to  human  health  from  ELF- 
EMFs  published  since  the  NIEHS  report  and  found  that  several  other  organizations  reached  the 
same  conclusions  (HPA  2006-TN1273;  WHO  2007-TN1272).  Additional  work  under  the 
auspices  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  updated  the  assessments  of  a  number  of 
scientific  groups  that  reflected  the  potential  for  transmission  line  EMFs  to  cause  adverse  health 
impacts  in  humans.  The  monograph  summarized  the  potential  for  ELF-EMFs  to  cause  diseases 
such  as  cancers  in  children  and  adults1  depression'  suicide'  reproductive  dysfunction' 
developmental  disorders'  immunological  modifications'  and  neurological  disease.  The  results  of 
the  review  by  WHO  (WHO  2007-TN1272)  found  the  extent  of  scientific  evidence  linking  these 
diseases  to  EMF  exposure  is  not  conclusive. 

These  conclusions  by  four  national  and  international  groups  are  in  agreement.  The  current 
scientific  evidence  regarding  the  chronic  effect  of  ELF-EMFs  does  not  conclusively  link  ELF- 
EMFs  to  adverse  health  impacts.  The  staff  will  continue  to  follow  developments  in  this  area. 

5.8.5  Occupational  Health 

In  general,  occupational  health  risks  for  the  PSEG  Site  are  expected  to  be  dominated  by 
occupational  injuries  to  workers  engaged  in  activities  such  as  maintenance,  testing,  and  site 
modifications.  Overexertions,  minor  bodily  injuries,  and  contact  with  an  object  or  equipment,  as 
well  as  falls,  slips,  and  trips,  are  the  most  commonly  encountered  injuries  associated  with  lost 
time  (BLS  2014-TN4222).  In  2009,  annual  incidence  rates  (the  number  of  injuries  and  illnesses 
per  100  full-time  workers)  for  electrical  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  workers 
for  New  Jersey  and  the  United  States  are  1.4  and  3.0,  respectively  (BLS  2010-TN2427; 

BLS  2010-TN2428).  Historically,  actual  injury  and  fatality  rates  at  nuclear  reactor  facilities  have 
been  lower  than  the  average  U.S.  industrial  rates.  In  2009,  the  incidence  rate  of  nonfatal 
injuries  and  illnesses  for  the  nuclear  electric  power  generation  industry  was  0.6  total  recordable 
cases  per  100  full-time-equivalent  employees,  with  0.1  cases  per  100  full-time-equivalent 
employees  involving  days  away  from  work,  job  transfer,  or  restriction  (BLS  2010-TN2427). 


NUREG-2168 


5-80 


November  2015 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Based  on  the  assumption  of  a  total  operations  workforce  of  600  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  these 
rates  suggest  that  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be 
associated  with  approximately  four  occupational  injuries  and  illnesses  per  year.  However,  these 
are  gross  estimates  and  do  not  take  into  account  risks  workers  would  face  if  they  were 
employed  somewhere  other  than  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

In  addition,  PSEG  monitors  current  operations  at  HCGS  and  SGS  for  OSHA  recordable  and 
nonrecordable  injury  rates  per  PSEG  Nuclear  procedure  SA-AA-123,  Injury  and  Illness 
Reporting  and  Recordkeeping  (PSEG  2012-TN2403).  This  procedure  ensures  accurate  and 
consistent  injury  recording  to  maintain  compliance  with  OSHA  regulations  and  PSEG  policy.  As 
of  June  2012,  the  HCGS  OSHA  recordable  rate  is  0.61,  which  represents  a  rolling  average  of 
injuries  per  200,000  person-hours  worked.  The  OSHA  recordable  rate  for  SGS  as  of  the  end  of 
June  2012  is  0.1 1  per  200,000  person-hours  worked.  The  201 1  HCGS  OSHA  recordable  rate 
was  0.34,  while  the  SGS  OSHA  recordable  rate  for  201 1  was  0.40.  These  OSHA  recordable 
rates  are  applicable  to  PSEG  employees  only. 

Occupational  injury  and  fatality  risks  are  reduced  by  strict  adherence  to  NRC  and  OSHA  safety 
standards  (29  CFR  Part  1910-TN654),  practices,  and  procedures.  Appropriate  State  and  local 
statutes  also  must  be  considered  when  the  occupational  hazards  and  health  risks  associated 
with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant’s  operation  are  being  assessed.  The  staff  assumes  adherence 
to  NRC,  OSHA,  and  State  safety  standards,  practices,  and  procedures  during  operation  of  a 
new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Additional  occupational  health  impacts  may  result  from  exposure 
to  hazards  such  as  noise,  toxic  or  oxygen-replacing  gases,  etiological  agents  in  the  condenser 
bays,  and  caustic  agents.  PSEG  reports  it  maintains  a  health  and  safety  program  to  protect 
workers  from  industrial  safety  risks  at  the  operating  units  and  would  implement  the  program  for 
a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2012-TN2403).  Health  impacts  on 
workers  from  nonradiological  emissions,  noise,  and  EMFs  would  be  monitored  and  controlled  in 
accordance  with  the  applicable  OSHA  regulations  and  would  be  minimal. 

5.8.6  Impacts  of  Transporting  Operations  Personnel  to  the  PSEG  Site 

The  general  approach  used  to  estimate  nonradiological  impacts  from  transport  of  operations 
and  refueling  personnel  to  and  from  the  PSEG  Site  was  the  same  as  that  used  to  calculate 
impacts  from  transport  of  the  construction  workforce.  The  parameter  assumptions  needed  to 
calculate  nonradiological  impacts  for  transportation  of  operational  workforce  are  discussed 
below. 

•  The  average  number  of  workers  needed  for  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  was  given  as  600  in  the  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280),  which  also  stated  that  a  peak

•  It  is  assumed  workers  travel  50  mi  roundtrip  to  the  PSEG  Site  for  250  days  per  year.  It  is 
assumed  that  no  sharing  of  personnel  with  HCGS  and  SGS  operations  staff  would  occur. 

•  To  develop  representative  commuter  traffic  impacts,  rates  of  New  Jersey  traffic  accidents, 
injuries,  and  fatalities  were  obtained  from  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Transportation 
(NJDOT  2012)  and  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation,  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety 
Administration  (USDOT  2012)  for  the  years  2006  to  2010.

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


The  estimated  impacts  of  transporting  operations  and  outage  workers  to  and  from  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  shown  in  Table  5-14.  The  total  number  of  traffic 
fatalities  during  operations,  including  both  operations  and  outage  personnel,  are  estimated  to 
average  less  than  0.15  annually.  The  estimated  average  number  of  injuries  would  0.18  annually 
from  traffic  accidents  among  both  the  permanent  operations  and  outage  workforces.  The 
addition  of  operational  personnel  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  expected  to  result  in  a  minimal,  if  not 
imperceptible,  increase  relative  to  the  current  traffic  injury  risk  in  the  area  surrounding  the 
PSEG  Site.

5.8.7  Summary  of  Nonradiological  Health  Impacts 

The  review  team  evaluated  health  impacts  on  the  public  and  workers  from  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  including  cooling  systems,  noise  generated  by  unit 
operations,  acute  and  chronic  impacts  of  EMFs  from  transmission  lines,  and  transportation  of 
operations  and  outage  workers  to  and  from  the  site.  Health  risks  to  workers  are  expected  to  be 
dominated  by  occupational  injuries  at  rates  below  the  average  U.S.  industrial  rates.  Health 
impacts  on  the  public  and  workers  from  operations  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  including 
exposure  to  etiologic  microorganisms,  noise  generated  by  plant  operations,  and  acute  impacts 
of  EMFs,  would  be  minimal.  Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s 
independent  review,  the  review  team  concludes  the  potential  nonradiological  health  impacts 
resulting  from  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL. 
Current  scientific  evidence  regarding  the  chronic  impacts  of  EMFs  on  public  health  is 
inconclusive,  and  the  staff  will  continue  to  follow  developments  in  this  area. 

5.9  Radiological  Impacts  of  Normal  Operations 

This  section  addresses  the  radiological  impacts  of  normal  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  on  the  PSEG  Site,  including  a  discussion  of  the  estimated  radiation  dose  to  a  member  of 
the  public  and  to  the  biota  inhabiting  the  area  around  the  PSEG  Site.  Estimated  doses  to 
workers  are  also  discussed.  The  determination  of  radiological  impacts  was  based  on  the  PPE 
approach,  where  bounding  direct  radiation  and  liquid  and  gaseous  radiological  effluents  were 
used  in  the  evaluation. 

5.9.1  Exposure  Pathways 

The  public  and  biota  would  be  exposed  to  increased  ambient  background  radiation  from  normal 
operations  of  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  via  liquid  effluent,  gaseous  effluent,  and  direct 
radiation  pathways.  PSEG  estimated  the  potential  exposures  to  the  public  and  biota  by 
evaluating  exposure  pathways  typical  of  those  surrounding  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  PSEG  considered  pathways  that  could  cause  the  highest  calculated  radiological

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


dose  based  on  the  use  of  the  environment  by  the  residents  located  around  the  site 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2015-TN4283).  For  example,  factors  such  as  the  location  of 
homes  in  the  area,  consumption  of  milk  from  dairy  cows  and  goats  in  the  area,  consumption  of 
meat,  and  consumption  of  vegetables  grown  in  area  gardens  were  considered. 

For  the  liquid  effluent  release  pathway,  PSEG  considered  the  following  exposure  pathways  in 
evaluating  the  dose  to  the  maximally  exposed  individual  (MEI):  (1 )  ingestion  of  aquatic 
organisms  as  food  (i.e. ,  fish  and  invertebrates);  (2)  ingestion  of  meats,  vegetables,  and  milk; 
and  (3)  radiation  exposure  from  swimming  and  boating  activities  on  the  Delaware  River.  The 
drinking  water  exposure  pathway  was  not  considered,  because  the  Delaware  River  is  composed 
of  brackish  water  and  is  not  a  potable  source  of  water.  Liquid  effluents  were  assumed  to  be 
released  through  a  site  outfall  into  the  Delaware  River.  The  analysis  for  population  dose 
considered  the  same  exposure  pathways  as  those  used  for  the  individual  dose  assessment. 

For  the  gaseous  release  pathway,  PSEG  considered  the  following  exposure  pathways  in 
evaluating  the  dose  to  the  MEI  and  to  the  population:  (1)  immersion  in  airborne  activity  in  the 
plume;  (2)  direct  radiation  exposure  from  deposited  activity  on  the  ground;  (3)  inhalation  of 
airborne  activity  in  the  plume;  (4)  ingestion  of  meat  and  milk,  including  goat  milk;  and  (5) 
ingestion  of  garden  fruit  and  vegetables  (see  Figure  5-6). 

For  population  doses  from  the  gaseous  effluents,  PSEG  used  the  same  exposure  pathways  as 
used  for  the  individual  dose  assessment,  including  the  assumed  cow  and  goat  milk  ingestion 
pathway.  All  agricultural  products  grown  within  50  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site  were  assumed  to  be 
consumed  by  the  population  within  50  mi  of  the  site  (Figure  5-6). 

PSEG  states  that  sources  of  direct  radiation  from  SGS  and  HCGS  (including  an  operational 
ISFSI)  are  shielded  and  do  not  contribute  significantly  to  the  external  radiation  levels  at  the  site 
boundary  or  the  population.  If  an  ISFSI  is  needed  for  a  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  the  impacts 
would  likely  be  similar,  namely  not  contributing  significantly  to  radiation  levels  at  the  site 
boundary  or  to  offsite  radiation  levels.  As  discussed  in  Section  2.11,  doses  from  SGS  and 
HCGS  due  to  direct  radiation  are  measured  using  thermoluminescent  dosimeters  located 
around  the  site,  and  the  measured  values  are  comparable  to  the  preoperational  background 
radiation  data.  PSEG  states  that  direct  dose  contribution  from  the  PSEG  Site  would  be 
bounded  by  the  ABWR  design  and  that  the  direct  dose  from  the  other  advanced  reactor  designs 
being  considered  would  be  less  than  the  ABWR  design  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2015- 
TN4283). 

Exposure  pathways  considered  by  PSEG  in  the  ER  in  evaluating  dose  to  biota  are  shown  in 
Figure  5-7  and  include  the  following 

•  ingestion  of  aquatic  foods, 

•  ingestion  of  water, 

•  external  exposure  from  water  immersion  or  surface  effect, 

•  inhalation  of  airborne  radionuclides, 

•  external  exposure  to  immersion  in  gaseous  effluent  plumes,  and 

•  surface  exposure  from  deposition  of  iodine  and  particulates  from  gaseous  effluents.

5.9.2  Radiation  Doses  to  Members  of  the  Public 

PSEG  calculated  the  dose  to  the  MEI  and  the  population  living  within  a  50-mi  radius  of  the 
PSEG  Site  from  both  the  liquid  and  gaseous  effluent  release  pathways  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
As  discussed  in  the  previous  sections,  direct  radiation  exposure  to  MEI  from  sources  of 
radiation  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  bounded  by  the  ABWR  design. 

5. 9.2. 7  L  iquid  Effluent  Path  way 

Liquid  pathway  doses  to  the  MEI  were  calculated  using  the  LADTAP  II  computer  program 
(Strenge  et  al.  1986-TN82).  The  following  activities  were  considered  in  the  dose  calculations: 

(1 )  consumption  of  meat;  (2)  consumption  of  fish,  shellfish,  or  other  aquatic  organisms  from 
water  sources  affected  by  liquid  effluents;  and  (3)  direct  radiation  from  swimming  in,  boating  on, 
and  shoreline  use  of  water  bodies  affected  by  liquid  effluents.  PSEG  stated  that  the  brackish 
water  from  the  Delaware  River  is  not  a  potable  source  of  water  and  is  not  used  for  irrigation  in 
the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  liquid  effluent  releases  used  in  the  estimates  of  dose  are  found  in  Table  5.4-2  of  the  ER 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Other  parameters  used  as  inputs  to  the  LADTAP  II  program — including 
the  effluent  discharge  rate,  dilution  factor  for  discharge,  transit  time  to  receptor,  and  liquid 
pathway  consumption  and  usage  factors  (i.e. ,  shoreline  usage  and  fish  consumption) — are 
found  in  ER  Tables  5.4-3,  11.2-3,  and  1 1.2-4  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG  calculated  liquid 
pathway  doses  to  the  MEI;  these  dose  estimates  are  shown  in  ER  Table  5.4-4  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  The  MEI  is  an  adult  for  whom  the  majority  of  the  dose  comes  from  fish  ingestion,  and 
the  maximally  exposed  organ  is  the  gastrointestinal  lining  of  lower  intestine  (GI-LLI).  ER  Table 
5.4-1 1  provides  the  annual  whole  body  and  thyroid  doses  to  the  population  for  the  various  liquid 
pathways  calculated  by  PSEG  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

The  NRC  staff  recognizes  the  LADTAP  II  computer  program  as  an  appropriate  method  for 
calculating  the  dose  to  the  MEI  for  liquid  effluent  releases.  The  staff  performed  an  independent 
evaluation  of  liquid  pathway  doses  by  using  input  parameters  from  the  ER,  and  results  were 
similar  to  those  in  the  ESP.  The  NRC  staff  judged  all  input  parameters  used  in  PSEG’s 
calculations  to  be  appropriate.  Results  of  the  staffs  independent  evaluation  are  presented  in

5. 9. 2. 2  Gaseous  Effluent  Path  way 

PSEG  calculated  the  gaseous  pathway  doses  to  the  MEI  using  the  GASPAR  II  computer 
program  (Strenge  et  al.  1987-TN83)  at  the  following  locations:  nearest  meat  animal,  nearest 
milk-producing  animals  (cow/goat),  nearest  residence,  nearest  vegetable  garden,  and  nearest 
site  boundary.  The  GASPAR  II  computer  program  was  also  used  to  calculate  annual  population 
doses.  The  following  activities  were  considered  in  the  dose  calculations:  (1)  direct  radiation 
from  submersion  in  the  gaseous  effluent  cloud  and  exposure  to  particulates  deposited  on  the 
ground;  (2)  inhalation  of  gases  and  particulates;  (3)  ingestion  of  milk  and  meat  from  animals 
eating  grass  affected  by  gases  and  particulates  deposited  on  the  ground;  and  (4)  ingestion  of 
foods  (e.g.,  vegetables)  affected  by  gases  and  particulates  deposited  on  the  ground. 

The  gaseous  effluent  releases  used  in  the  estimate  of  dose  to  the  MEI  and  population  are  found 
in  ER  Table  5.4-1  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Other  parameters  used  as  inputs  to  the  GASPAR  II 
program,  including  population  data,  milk  production  rates,  vegetable  production  rates,  meat 
production  rates,  atmospheric  dispersion  factors,  ground  deposition  factors,  receptor  locations, 
and  consumption  factors,  are  found  in  ER  Tables  5.4-5,  5.4-6,  and  5.4-7  (PSEG  2015-TN4280) 
or  were  obtained  by  the  staff  during  the  Environmental  Site  Audit. 

Gaseous  pathway  doses  to  MEI  calculated  by  PSEG  are  found  in  Site  Safety  Analysis  Report 
(SSAR)  Table  1 1.3-7  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283).  ER  Table  5.4-12  shows  the  annual  whole  body 
and  thyroid  doses  to  the  population  from  various  gaseous  pathways  calculated  by  PSEG 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

The  NRC  staff  recognizes  the  GASPAR  II  computer  program  as  an  appropriate  tool  for 
calculating  dose  to  the  MEI  and  population  from  gaseous  effluent  releases.  The  NRC  staff 
performed  an  independent  evaluation  of  gaseous  pathway  doses  and  found  similar  results  (see 
Table  5-16).  All  input  parameters  used  in  the  PSEG  calculations  were  judged  by  the  staff  to  be 
appropriate.  Results  of  the  NRC  staffs  independent  evaluation  are  found  in  Appendix  G.

5.9.3  Impacts  to  Members  of  the  Public 

This  section  describes  the  NRC  staffs  evaluation  of  the  estimated  impacts  from  radiological 
releases  and  direct  radiation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  evaluation 
addresses  dose  from  operations  to  the  MEI  located  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  population 
dose  (collective  dose  to  the  population  within  50  mi)  around  the  site. 

5. 9. 3. 7  Maximally  Exposed  Individual 

PSEG  states  the  total  body  and  organ  dose  estimates  to  the  MEI  from  liquid  and  gaseous 
effluents  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  within  the  design  objectives  of  Appendix  I 
(10  CFR  Part  50,  Appendix  I  [TN249]).  Total  body  and  maximum  organ  annual  doses  at  the 
nearest  location  from  liquid  effluents  were  well  within  the  respective  3  mrem  and  10  mrem 
Appendix  I  design  objectives.  Annual  doses  at  the  exclusion  area  boundary  from  gaseous 
effluents  were  well  within  the  Appendix  I  design  objectives  of  10  mrad  air  dose  from  gamma

compliance  with  Appendix  I  dose  design  objectives  and  found  similar  results,  as  shown  in 
Appendix  G.  Gaseous  and  liquid  effluents  from  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  below  the  Appendix  I

PSEG  compared  the  combined  dose  estimates  from  direct  radiation  and  gaseous  and  liquid 
effluents  from  the  existing  units  (SGS  Unit  1,  SGS  Unit  2,  and  HCGS  Unit  1)  and  a  new  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  against  the  40  CFR  Part  190  (TN739).  Table  5-18  shows  that  PSEG’s 
assessment  of  the  total  doses  to  the  MEI  would  be  well  below  the  standards  of  40  CFR  Part  1 90 
(TN739).  The  NRC  staff  completed  an  independent  evaluation  of  compliance  with  the 
standards  of  40  CFR  Part  190  (TN739)  and  found  similar  results,  as  shown  in  Appendix  G. 

5. 9. 3. 2  Population  Dose 

PSEG  estimates  the  annual  collective  total  body  dose  within  a  50-mi  radius  of  the  PSEG  Site  to 
be  65.9  person-rem,  based  on  the  liquid  and  gaseous  pathway  collective  doses  provided  in  ER 
Tables  5.4-1 1  and  5.4-1 2,  respectively  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Collective  dose  was  estimated 
using  a  combination  of  the  GASPAR  II  and  LADTAP  II  computer  codes,  accounting  for  gaseous 
and  liquid  effluent  pathways,  respectively.  The  estimated  collective  dose  to  the  same 
population  from  natural  background  radiation  is  estimated  to  be  about  2,531,000  person- 
rem/yr.  The  dose  from  natural  background  radiation  was  calculated  by  multiplying  the  50-mi 
radius  population  estimate  (8,138,635)  for  the  year  2081  by  the  annual  background  dose  rate 
(31 1  mrem/yr)  (NCRP  2009-TN420).  The  NRC  staffs  independent  estimate  of  the  collective 
dose  is  discussed  in  Appendix  G. 

Radiation  protection  experts  assume  that  any  amount  of  radiation  may  pose  some  risk  of 
causing  cancer  or  a  severe  hereditary  effect  and  that  the  risk  is  greater  for  higher  radiation 
exposures.  Therefore,  a  linear,  no-threshold  dose  response  relationship  is  used  to  describe  the 
relationship  between  radiation  dose  and  detriments  such  as  cancer  induction.  Simply  stated, 
any  increase  in  dose,  no  matter  how  small,  results  in  an  incremental  increase  in  health  risk.  A

recent  report  by  the  National  Research  Council  (2006-TN296),  the  Biological  Effects  of  Ionizing 
Radiation  (BEIR)  VII  report,  uses  the  linear,  no-threshold  dose  response  model  as  a  basis  for 
estimating  the  risks  from  low  doses.  This  approach  is  accepted  by  NRC  staff  as  a  conservative 
model  for  estimating  health  risk  from  radiation  exposure,  recognizing  the  model  probably 
overestimates  those  risks.  Based  on  this  method,  the  NRC  staff  estimated  the  risk  to  the  public 
from  radiation  exposure  using  the  nominal  probability  coefficient  for  total  detriment.  In  a  recent 
publication  of  the  International  Commission  on  Radiological  Protection  (ICRP,  ICRP  2007- 
TN422),  a  health  detriment  of  570  was  associated  with  fatal  cancers,  nonfatal  cancers,  and 
severe  hereditary  effects  per  1,000,000  person-rem  or  0.00057  effects  per  person-rem.

Note:  Not  Avail.  =  Not  Available.  The  Radioactive  Effluent  Release  Report  (RERR)  provides  total  liquid  and 

gaseous  dose  from  SGS  and  HCGS  but  does  not  provide  a  breakdown  into  the  separate  liquid  and  gaseous  dose 

component  for  organ  and  thyroid  dose.

account  for  dual  units  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

(c)  Liquid  MEI  for  the  limiting  organ  GI-LLI  dose  is  an  adult.  Value  is  obtained  from  ER  Table  5.4-4  and  multiplied 
by  two  to  account  for  dual  units  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

(d)  Gaseous  MEI  for  this  case  is  a  child.  Value  is  the  sum  of  child  total  body  dose  from  meat,  milk,  vegetable, 
and  inhalation  exposure  plus  the  ground  plan  and  plume  exposure  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

exposure  plus  the  ground  plan  and  plume  exposure  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

(f)  Gaseous  MEI  for  this  case  is  a  child,  and  the  limiting  organ  is  the  bone.  Value  is  the  sum  of  child  bone  dose 
from  meat,  milk,  vegetable,  and  inhalation  exposure  plus  the  ground  plan  and  plume  exposure  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).

Both  the  National  Council  on  Radiation  Protection  &  Measurements  (NCRP)  and  ICRP  suggest 
that  when  the  collective  effective  dose  is  smaller  than  the  reciprocal  of  the  relevant  risk 
detriment  (i.e. ,  less  than  1/0.00057,  which  is  less  than  1,754  person-rem),  the  assessment 
should  note  the  most  likely  number  of  excess  health  effects  is  zero  (NCRP  1995-TN728; 

ICRP  2007-TN422).  As  noted  above,  the  estimated  annual  collective  total  body  dose  to  the 
population  living  within  50  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site  is  65.9  person-rem,  which  is  less  than  the 
1 ,754  person-rem  value  that  both  ICRP  and  NCRP  suggest  would  most  likely  result  in  zero 
excess  health  effects  (NCRP  1995-TN728;  ICRP  2007-TN422).

In  addition,  at  the  request  of  the  U.S.  Congress,  the  National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  conducted  a 
study  and  published  a  report  in  1990  titled  Cancer  in  Populations  Living  Near  Nuclear  Facilities 
(Jablon  et  al.  1990-TN1257).  The  NCI  report  included  an  evaluation  of  health  statistics  around 
all  nuclear  power  plants,  as  well  as  several  other  nuclear  fuel  cycle  facilities,  in  operation  in  the 
United  States  in  1981;  it  found  "no  evidence  that  an  excess  occurrence  of  cancer  has  resulted 
from  living  near  nuclear  facilities”  (Jablon  et  al.  1990-TN1257). 

5. 9. 3. 3  Summary  of  Radiological  Impacts  to  Members  of  the  Public 

The  NRC  staff  evaluated  the  health  impacts  from  routine  gaseous  and  liquid  radiological  effluent 
releases  from  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Based  on  the  information  provided  by 
PSEG  and  NRC  staffs  own  independent  evaluation,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  there  would  be  no 
observable  health  impacts  to  the  public  from  normal  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  the 
health  impacts  would  be  SMALL,  and  additional  mitigation  would  not  be  warranted. 

5.9.4  Occupational  Doses  to  Workers 

PSEG  concluded  the  maximum  annual  occupational  dose  from  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  is 
expected  to  be  less  than  that  from  SGS  and  HCGS  because  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  designs 
and  application  of  technology  would  result  in  reduced  occupational  radiation  exposure.  For 
2007,  the  collective  total  effective  dose  equivalent  (TEDE)  to  workers  was  118  person-rem  at 
SGS  and  191  person-rem  at  HCGS  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  If  two  new  API  000  units  were 
constructed  at  the  PSEG  Site,  some  dose  would  be  received  by  construction  workers  at  the 
second  unit  from  operation  of  the  first  unit.  In  the  API  000  Design  Control  Document  (DCD) 
(Westinghouse  201 1 -TN261 ),  Westinghouse  estimated  an  annual  collective  dose  of 
63.2  man-rem/yr  for  the  following  activities:  reactor  operations  and  surveillance  (21 .8%);  routine 
inspection  and  maintenance  (19.2%);  in-service  inspection  (22.7%);  special  maintenance 
(23.7%);  waste  processing  (8.2%);  and  refueling  (4.4%).  Considering  this  estimate,  it  is 
expected  that  any  dose  received  by  construction  workers  at  the  second  new  unit  from  the 
operation  of  the  first  new  unit  would  be  SMALL. 

5.9.5  Impacts  to  Biota  Other  than  Humans 

PSEG  estimated  doses  to  biota  in  the  site  environs  using  surrogate  species.  Surrogate  species 
used  in  the  ER  are  well  defined  and  provide  an  acceptable  method  for  evaluating  doses  to  the 
biota  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Surrogate  species  analysis  was  performed  for  aquatic  species 
such  as  fish,  invertebrates,  and  algae,  and  for  terrestrial  species  such  as  muskrats,  raccoons, 
and  birds,  such  as  herons  and  ducks.  Exposure  pathways  considered  in  evaluating  doses  to 
biota  other  than  humans  were  discussed  in  Section  5.9.1  and  are  shown  in  Figure  5-7.  The 
NRC  staff  has  reviewed  PSEG’s  analysis  and  completed  an  independent  evaluation  that  found 
similar  results,  as  shown  in  Appendix  G. 

5. 9.5.1  L  iquid  Effluent  Path  way 

PSEG  used  the  LADTAP  II  computer  code  (Strenge  et  al.  1986-TN82)  to  calculate  doses  to  the 
biota  from  the  liquid  effluent  pathway.  In  estimating  the  concentration  of  radioactive  effluents  in 
the  Delaware  River,  PSEG  included  no  credit  for  dilution  or  transit  time  from  the  outflow.  Liquid 
pathway  doses  were  higher  for  biota  compared  to  humans  because  of  considerations  for 


November  2015 


5-91 


NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


bioaccumulation  of  radionuclides,  ingestion  of  aquatic  plants,  ingestion  of  invertebrates, 
increased  time  spent  in  water  and  on  the  shoreline  compared  to  humans,  and  the  assumption  of 
no  dilution  beyond  the  outflow.  The  liquid  effluent  releases  used  in  estimating  biota  dose  are 
found  in  ER  Table  5.4-13  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

5. 9. 5. 2  Gaseous  Effluent  Pathway 

Gaseous  effluents  would  contribute  to  the  total  body  dose  of  the  terrestrial  surrogate  species 
(i.e.,  muskrat,  raccoon,  heron,  and  duck).  The  exposure  pathways  include  inhalation  of  airborne 
radionuclides,  external  exposure  due  to  immersion  in  gaseous  effluent  plumes,  and  surface 
exposure  from  deposition  of  iodine  and  particulates  from  gaseous  effluents.  PSEG  used  the 
calculations  methods  of  MEI  from  gaseous  effluent  releases  described  in  Section  5.9.2  to 
calculate  dose  to  terrestrial  surrogate  species,  with  a  modification  increasing  the  ground 
deposition  factors  by  a  factor  of  two  to  account  for  the  closer  proximity  of  terrestrial  animals  to 
the  ground  compared  to  the  MEI.  The  gaseous  effluent  releases  used  in  estimating  dose  are 
found  in  ER  Table  5.4-1,  and  the  gaseous  doses  also  are  presented  in  ER  Table  5.4-13 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Total  body  dose  estimates  to  the  surrogate  species  from  the  gaseous 
pathway  are  shown  in  Table  5-19  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

5. 9. 5. 3  Impact  of  Estimated  Non  human  Biota  Doses 

The  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency  (IAEA)  and  NCRP  reported  a  chronic  absorbed  dose 
rate  of  no  greater  than  1 ,000  mrad/d  would  ensure  protection  of  aquatic  organism  population 
(IAEA  1992-TN712;  NCRP  1991-TN729).  IAEA  also  concluded  that  a  chronic  absorbed  dose 
rate  of  100  mrad/d  or  less  does  not  appear  to  cause  observable  changes  in  terrestrial  animal 
populations  (IAEA  1992-TN712). 

Table  5-20  compares  estimated  absorbed  dose  rates  to  surrogate  biota  species  produced  by 
releases  from  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  to  the  IAEA/NCRP  biota  dose  guidelines 
(IAEA  1992-TN712;  NCRP  1991-TN729).  The  absorbed  dose  rates  from  all  surrogate  species 
were  much  less  than  the  guidelines.  The  absorbed  dose  rate  estimated  for  the  PSEG  Site  is 
conservative  because  no  consideration  was  given  to  dilution  or  decay  of  liquid  effluents  during 
transit.  Actual  absorbed  dose  rates  to  biota  are  likely  to  be  much  less.

On  the  basis  of  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  NRC  staff  s  independent  evaluation, 
the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  radiological  impact  on  nonhuman  biota  from  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL,  and  additional  mitigation  is  not  warranted. 

5.9.6  Radiological  Monitoring 

A  REMP  has  been  in  place  for  the  PSEG  Site  since  operations  began  in  1977,  with 
preoperational  sample  collection  activities  from  1973  to  1976  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The 
REMP  includes  monitoring  of  the  airborne  exposure  pathway,  direct  exposure  pathway,  water 
exposure  pathway,  aquatic  exposure  pathway  from  the  Delaware  River,  and  ingestion  exposure 
pathway  in  a  5-mi  radius  of  the  station,  with  indicator  locations  near  the  site  perimeter  and 
control  locations  at  distances  greater  than  10  mi.  An  annual  survey  is  conducted  for  the  area 
surrounding  the  site  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  assumptions  used  in  the  analyses,  including  the 
occurrence  of  milk  production.  The  preoperational  REMP  sampled  various  media  in  the 
environment  to  determine  a  baseline  from  which  to  observe  the  magnitude  and  fluctuation  of 
radioactivity  in  the  environment  once  the  new  power  plant  began  operation. 

The  preoperational  program  included  collection  and  analysis  of  air  particulates,  precipitation, 
crops,  soil,  well  water,  surface  water,  fish,  and  silt,  as  well  as  measurement  of  ambient  gamma 
radiation.  After  operation  of  SGS  Unit  1  began  in  1977,  the  monitoring  program  continued  to 
assess  the  radiological  impacts  on  workers,  the  public,  and  the  environment.  Radiological 
releases  are  summarized  in  the  Annual  Radiological  Environmental  Operating  Report  (e.g., 
PSEG  2014-TN4299)  and  the  PSEG  Nuclear  LLC  Annual  Radioactive  Effluent  Release  Report 
for  the  Salem  and  Hope  Creek  Generating  Stations  (e.g.,  PSEG  2014-TN421 9).  The  limits  for 
all  radiological  releases  are  specified  in  the  respective  HCGS  and  SGS  offsite  dose  calculation 
manuals  (ODCMs).  Administrative  controls  and  physical  barriers  are  currently  in  place  or  will  be 
implemented  to  monitor  and  minimize  dose  to  construction  workers  from  the  independent  spent 
fuel  storage  installation  (ISFSI).

NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


As  discussed  in  Section  2.11,  operations  personnel  at  SGS  in  2002  identified  a  release  of 
radioactive  liquids  from  the  Unit  1  Spent  Fuel  Pool  to  the  environment.  In  the  HCGS  and  SGS 
annual  Radioactive  Effluent  Release  Reports  (RERR),  PSEG  describes  how  it  developed  a 
Remedial  Action  Work  Plan  and  installed  a  Groundwater  Recovery  System  to  remove  the 
groundwater  containing  tritium  (PSEG  2013-TN2739).  The  system  is  designed  to  prevent 
migration  of  the  tritium  plume  toward  the  plant  boundary  and  to  reduce  the  concentrations  of 
tritium  in  the  groundwater.  An  RGPP  was  established  in  2006  with  monitoring  wells  installed 
and  developed  for  both  SGS  and  HCGS  that  allow  for  groundwater  samples  to  be  collected  and 
analyzed  at  a  minimum  frequency  of  semi-annually  to  a  lower  limit  of  detection  of  200  pCi/L. 
RGPP  data  are  published  in  the  annual  RERR  (PSEG  2013-TN2739). 

No  additional  monitoring  program  has  been  established  for  the  PSEG  Site.  To  the  greatest 
extent  practical,  the  REMP  would  use  the  procedures  and  sampling  locations  used  by  the 
existing  REMP,  ODCMs,  and  recent  monitoring  reports  from  HCGS  and  SGS.  However,  if  any 
new  monitoring  locations  and  other  monitoring  requirements  are  established  for  a  new  plant, 
they  would  be  provided  in  the  COL  application  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  NRC  staff  have 
reviewed  these  documents  and  determined  the  current  operational  monitoring  program  is 
adequate  to  establish  the  radiological  baseline  for  comparison  with  the  expected  impacts  on  the 
environment  related  to  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

5.10  Nonradiological  Waste  Impacts 

This  section  describes  potential  impacts  on  the  environment  that  could  result  from  the 
generation,  handling,  and  disposal  of  nonradioactive  waste  and  mixed  waste  during  operation  of 
a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  As  discussed  in  Section  3.4.4,  the  types  of 
nonradioactive  waste  that  would  be  generated,  handled,  and  disposed  of  during  operational 
activities  include  solid  wastes,  liquid  effluents,  and  air  emissions.  Solid  wastes  include 
municipal  waste,  dredge  spoils,  sewage  treatment  sludge,  and  industrial  wastes.  Liquid  waste 
includes  NPDES-permitted  discharges  (such  as  effluents  that  contain  chemicals  or  biocides), 
wastewater  effluents,  site  stormwater  runoff,  and  other  liquid  wastes  (such  as  used  oils,  paints, 
and  solvents  that  require  offsite  disposal).  Air  emissions  would  primarily  be  generated  by 
vehicles,  auxiliary  boilers,  diesel  generators  and/or  gas  turbines,  and  cooling  towers.  In 
addition,  small  quantities  of  hazardous  waste  and  mixed  waste  (waste  that  has  both  hazardous 
and  radioactive  characteristics)  may  be  generated  during  plant  operations.  The  assessment  of 
potential  impacts  resulting  from  these  types  of  wastes  is  presented  in  the  following  subsections. 

5.10.1  Impacts  to  Land 

The  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  generate  solid  and  liquid 
wastes  similar  to  those  already  generated  by  the  current  operations  of  HCGS  and  SGS. 

Although  the  total  volume  of  solid  and  liquid  wastes  would  increase  with  the  addition  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  no  new  solid  or  liquid  waste  types  are  expected  to  result 
from  operating  the  new  plant  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG  has  indicated  it  would  continue  to 
use  recycling  and  waste  minimization  practices  in  place  at  SGS  and  HCGS  for  nonradioactive 
solid  waste  generated  from  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Solid  wastes — such  as 
used  oils,  antifreeze,  scrap  metal,  lead-acid  batteries,  and  paper — that  could  be  recycled  or 
reused  would  be  managed  through  the  approved  and  licensed  contractor.  Solid  waste  that

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


could  not  be  recycled  or  reused  would  be  transported  to  licensed  offsite  commercial  disposal 
sites  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Spoils  from  maintenance  and  dredging  could  be  used  as  fill 
material.  Debris  collected  on  trash  screens  at  the  water  intake  structure  would  be  disposed  of 
offsite  in  accordance  with  State  regulations.  Sanitary  wastes  generated  by  the  operation  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  treated  on  the  site  and  discharged  to  the  Delaware  River  in 
accordance  with  NJDEP  and  DRBC  permits  and  requirements.  Residual  wastes  are  disposed 
of  offsite  in  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations,  and  permit  conditions  imposed  by 
Federal,  State,  and  local  agencies. 

Effective  practices  for  recycling  and  minimizing  waste  are  already  in  place  at  SGS  and  HCGS, 
and  PSEG  plans  to  manage  solid  and  liquid  wastes  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  in  a  similar 
manner  in  accordance  with  applicable  Federal,  State,  and  local  requirements  and  standards. 
For  these  reasons,  the  review  team  expects  that  impacts  on  land  from  nonradioactive  wastes 
generated  during  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minimal 
and  that  no  further  mitigation  is  warranted. 

5.10.2  Impacts  to  Water 

Effluents  containing  chemicals  or  biocides  from  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  would  be  discharged  mainly  to  the  Delaware  River.  Discharge  sources  would 
include  cooling  tower  blowdown,  wastewater  from  auxiliary  systems,  and  stormwater  runoff. 
Sections  5.2.3. 1  and  5. 2. 3. 2  discuss  impacts  on  the  quality  of  the  surface  water  and 
groundwater,  respectively,  from  operation  of  a  new  plant.  Nonradioactive  liquid  effluents 
discharged  to  the  Delaware  River  would  be  subject  to  limitations  contained  in  the  site’s  NJDEP 
and  DRBC  water-quality  permits  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Because  there  are  regulated  practices 
for  managing  liquid  discharges  containing  chemicals  or  biocides  and  other  wastewater,  and 
because  there  are  plans  for  managing  stormwater,  the  review  team  concludes  that  impacts  on 
water  from  nonradioactive  effluents  during  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  would  be  minimal,  and  no  further  mitigation  is  warranted. 

5.10.3  Impacts  to  Air 

Operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  result  in  gaseous  and 
particulate  emissions  from  the  operation  of  emergency  diesel  generators  and/or  gas  turbines, 
engine-driven  emergency  equipment,  auxiliary  boilers,  and  cooling  towers.  The  emergency 
diesel  generators  and/or  gas  turbines  and  engine-driven  emergency  equipment  would  operate 
intermittently,  and  the  auxiliary  boilers  would  operate  primarily  during  the  winter  months.  The 
cooling  towers  would  operate  continuously  and  be  a  constant  source  of  particulate  emissions. 

In  addition,  increased  vehicular  traffic  associated  with  the  personnel  needed  to  operate  a  new 
plant  would  increase  vehicle  emissions  in  the  area.  Impacts  on  air  quality  are  discussed  in 
detail  in  Section  5.7.1 .  Increases  in  air  emissions  from  operation  of  a  new  plant  would  be  in 
accordance  with  permits  issued  by  the  NJDEP  Division  of  Air  Quality  that  would  ensure 
compliance  with  Federal,  State,  and  local  air-quality  control  laws  and  regulations.  Because 
there  are  regulated  practices  for  managing  air  emissions  from  stationary  sources,  the  review 
team  concludes  impacts  on  air  from  nonradioactive  emissions  during  the  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minor,  and  no  further  mitigation  is  warranted.

5.10.4  Mixed  Waste  Impacts 

Mixed  waste  contains  both  low-level  radioactive  waste  and  hazardous  waste.  The  generation, 
storage,  treatment,  and  disposal  of  mixed  waste  is  regulated  by  the  Atomic  Energy  Act  of  1964 
(42  USC  201 1  et  seq.  -TN663),  the  Solid  Waste  Disposal  Act  of  1965  (42  USC  82  et  seq.  - 
TNI 032)  as  amended  by  the  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act  (RCRA,  42  USC  6901 
et  seq.  -TN1281)  in  1976,  and  the  Hazardous  and  Solid  Waste  Amendments  (42  USC  6921  et 
seq.  -TNI 033)  (which  amended  RCRA  in  1984).  Neither  HCGS  nor  SGS  currently  has 
processes  that  result  in  the  generation  of  mixed  waste  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  In  the  past,  most 
mixed  wastes  generated  at  HCGS  and  SGS  resulted  from  the  contamination  of  oils  (hydraulic 
and  lubricating)  used  in  plant  systems.  All  oils  currently  used  in  plant  systems  are 
nonhazardous  and  do  not  result  in  mixed  waste  if  they  become  radiologically  contaminated. 
Processes  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  similarly  designed  to  prevent  the 
generation  of  mixed  waste  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG  has  contingency  plans  and  spill 
prevention  procedures  for  treatment,  storage,  and  disposal  in  the  unlikely  event  of  mixed  waste 
generation.  Because  effective  practices  for  minimizing  mixed  waste  are  already  in  place  at  SGS 
and  HCGS,  the  review  team  concludes  impacts  from  the  generation  of  mixed  waste  during 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minimal,  and  no  further 
mitigation  is  warranted. 

5.10.5  Summary  of  Waste  Impacts 

Solid,  liquid,  gaseous,  and  mixed  wastes  generated  during  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  handled  according  to  county,  State,  and  Federal  regulations. 
NPDES  permits  for  permitted  releases  of  cooling  and  auxiliary  system  effluents  would  ensure 
compliance  with  CWA  as  well  as  NJDEP  and  DRBC  water-quality  requirements.  Wastewater 
discharge  would  be  required  to  comply  with  NPDES  limitations.  Air  emissions  from  new  plant 
operations  would  be  compliant  with  air-quality  standards  as  permitted  by  NJDEP  Division  of  Air 
Quality.  Processes  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  designed  to  prevent  the  generation  of 
mixed  wastes. 

The  review  team  concludes  the  potential  impacts  from  nonradioactive  waste  resulting  from 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL,  and  further 
mitigation  is  not  warranted,  on  the  basis  of  the  following: 

•  information  provided  by  PSEG; 

•  effective  practices  for  recycling,  minimizing,  managing,  and  disposing  of  wastes  already  in 
use  at  SGS  and  HCGS; 

•  the  review  team’s  expectation  that  regulatory  approvals  would  be  obtained  to  regulate  the 
additional  waste  that  would  be  generated  during  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant;  and 

•  the  review  team’s  independent  evaluation. 

Cumulative  impacts  on  water  and  air  from  nonradioactive  emissions  and  effluents  are  discussed 
in  Sections  7.2.2. 1  and  7.6,  respectively.  For  the  purposes  of  Chapter  9,  the  staff  concludes 
that  (1)  there  would  be  no  substantive  differences  between  the  impacts  from  nonradioactive 
waste  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  those  at  the  four  alternative  sites,  and  (2)  no  substantive 
cumulative  impacts  warrant  further  discussion  beyond  those  discussed  for  the  alternative  sites 
in  Section  9.3.

5.11  Environmental  Impacts  of  Postulated  Accidents 

The  NRC  staff  considered  the  radiological  consequences  on  the  environment  of  potential 
accidents  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Consequence  estimates  are  based 
on  the  following  four  different  reactor  designs:  ABWR,  API  000  with  a  dual  unit,  the  U.S. 
Evolutionary  Power  Reactor  (U.S.  EPR),  and  the  U.S.  Advanced  Pressurized  Water  Reactor 
(US-APWR). 

The  term  “accident,"  as  used  in  this  section,  refers  to  any  off-normal  event  not  addressed  in 
Section  5.9  that  results  in  release  of  radioactive  materials  into  the  environment.  The  focus  of 
this  review  is  on  events  that  could  lead  to  releases  substantially  in  excess  of  permissible  limits 
for  normal  operations.  Normal  release  limits  are  specified  in  10  CFR  Part  20,  Appendix  B, 

Table  2  (TN283). 

Many  safety  features  combine  to  reduce  the  risk  associated  with  accidents  at  nuclear  power 
plants.  Safety  features  in  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  the  sites,  which  compose 
the  first  line  of  defense,  are  intended  to  prevent  the  release  of  radioactive  materials  from  the 
site.  The  design  objectives  and  the  measures  for  keeping  levels  of  radioactive  materials  in 
effluents  to  unrestricted  areas  as  low  as  reasonably  achievable  (ALARA)  are  specified  in 
10  CFR  50,  Appendix  I  (TN249).  There  are  additional  measures  designed  to  mitigate  the 
consequences  of  failures  in  the  first  line  of  defense.  These  include  NRC  reactor  site  criteria  in 
10  CFR  100  (TN282),  which  require  the  site  to  have  certain  characteristics  that  reduce  the  risk 
to  the  public  and  the  potential  impacts  of  an  accident,  and  emergency  preparedness  plans  and 
protective  action  measures  for  the  site  and  environs,  as  set  forth  in  10  CFR  50.47  (TN249), 

10  CFR  50,  Appendix  E  (TN249),  and  NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1  (NRC  1980-TN512).  All  of 
these  safety  features,  measures,  and  plans  make  up  the  defense-in-depth  philosophy  to  protect 
the  health  and  safety  of  the  public  and  the  environment. 

On  March  1 1 ,  201 1 ,  and  for  an  extended  period  thereafter,  several  nuclear  power  plants  in 
Japan  experienced  the  loss  of  important  equipment  necessary  to  maintain  reactor  cooling  after 
the  combined  effects  of  severe  natural  phenomena:  an  earthquake  followed  by  the  tsunami  it 
caused.  In  response  to  these  events,  the  Commission  established  a  task  force  to  review  the 
current  regulatory  framework  in  place  in  the  United  States  and  to  make  recommendations  for 
improvements.  The  task  force  reported  the  results  of  its  review  (NRC  201 1-TN684)  on  July  12 
and  July  1 9,  201 1 .  As  part  of  the  short-term  review,  the  task  force  concluded  that,  while 
improvements  are  expected  to  be  made  as  a  result  of  the  lessons  learned,  the  continued 
operation  of  nuclear  power  plants  and  licensing  activities  for  new  plants  do  not  pose  an 
imminent  risk  to  public  health  and  safety.  In  addition,  a  number  of  areas  were  recommended  to 
the  Commission  for  long-term  consideration.  Collectively,  these  recommendations  are  intended 
to  clarify  and  strengthen  the  regulatory  framework  for  protection  against  severe  natural 
phenomena,  for  mitigation  of  effects  of  such  events,  for  coping  with  emergencies,  and  for 
improving  NRC  program  effectiveness. 

On  March  12,  2012,  the  NRC  issued  three  orders  and  a  request  for  information  (RFI)  to  holders 
of  U.S.  commercial  nuclear  reactor  licenses  and  construction  permits  to  enhance  safety  at 
U.S.  reactors  based  on  specific  lessons  learned  from  the  event  at  Japan’s  Fukushima  Dai-ichi 
nuclear  power  plant  as  given  in  the  task  force  report.

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


The  first  and  third  orders  apply  to  every  U.S.  commercial  nuclear  power  plant,  including  recently 
licensed  new  reactors.  The  first  order  requires  a  three-phase  approach  for  mitigating 
beyond-design-basis  external  events.  Licensees  are  required  to  use  installed  equipment  and 
resources  to  maintain  or  restore  core,  containment,  and  spent  fuel  pool  cooling  during  the  initial 
phase.  During  the  transition  phase,  licensees  are  required  to  provide  sufficient,  portable,  onsite 
equipment  and  consumables  to  maintain  or  restore  these  functions  until  they  can  be 
accomplished  with  resources  brought  from  offsite.  During  the  final  phase,  licensees  are 
required  to  obtain  sufficient  offsite  resources  to  sustain  those  functions  indefinitely  (77  FR 
16091-TN2476).  The  second  order  requires  reliable  hardened  vent  systems  at  boiling  water 
reactor  facilities  with  “Mark  I”  and  “Mark  II”  containment  structures  (77  FR  16098-TN2477).  The 
third  order  requires  reliable  spent  fuel  pool  level  instrumentation  (77  FR  16082-TN1424).  The 
RFI  addressed  five  topics:  (1 )  seismic  reevaluations,  (2)  flooding  reevaluations,  (3)  seismic 
hazard  walkdowns,  (4)  flooding  hazard  walkdowns,  and  (5)  a  request  for  licensees  to  assess 
their  current  communications  system  and  equipment  under  conditions  of  onsite  and  offsite 
damage  and  prolonged  station  blackout  as  well  as  perform  a  staffing  study  to  determine  the 
number  and  qualifications  of  staff  required  to  fill  all  necessary  positions  in  response  to  a  multi¬ 
unit  event  (NRC  2012-TN2198;  NRC  2012-TN2903).  The  RFI  requested  reactor  licensees  to 
reevaluate  seismic  and  flooding  hazards  using  present-day  methods  to  determine  if  the  plant’s 
design  basis  needs  to  be  changed. 

On  April  30,  2015,  the  NRC  staff  proposed  rulemaking  to  the  Commission  in  SECY-15-0065 
concerning  the  mitigation  of  beyond-design-basis  events  that  would  establish  requirements  for 
certain  nuclear  power  reactor  licensees  and  applicants  (NRC  201 5-TN4300).  This  proposed 
rulemaking  would  principally  place  into  regulations  the  three  orders  previously  discussed  along 
with  other  additional  requirements.  Namely,  the  proposed  rulemaking  would  1 )  make 
generically  applicable  requirements  previously  imposed  by  order  for  mitigation  of  beyond- 
design-basis  external  events  and  for  monitoring  spent  fuel  pool  wide-range  level;  2)  include 
proposed  provisions  to  have  an  integrated  response  capability;  3)  include  proposed 
requirements  for  increased  emergency  response  capabilities  for  multi-unit  events;  4)  provide 
requirements  for  new  reactor  designs;  and  5)  address  a  number  of  petitions  for  rulemaking 
(PRMs)  submitted  in  the  aftermath  of  the  March  2011  Fukushima  Dai-ichi  event.  The 
Commission  will  determine  whether  to  approve  or  modify  the  NRC  staffs  proposed  rule  before  it 
is  published  for  public  comment. 

The  NRC  staff  issued  RAIs  to  PSEG  requesting  information  to  address  the  first  RFI  topic 
(NRC  2012-TN2904).  All  of  the  containment  designs  differ  from  those  identified  in  the 
second  order;  therefore,  the  actions  addressed  in  this  order  are  not  applicable  to  the  PSEG  Site. 
The  NRC’s  evaluation  of  PSEG’s  responses  is  addressed  in  the  NRC’s  Final  Safety  Evaluation 
Report,  which  includes  those  changes  that  were  identified  by  the  NRC  staff  as  being  necessary 
as  well  as  those  committed  by  the  applicant  in  their  regulatory  commitments  associated  with 
RAI  responses  or  otherwise.  All  these  changes  were  incorporated  by  the  applicant  in  Revision 
4  of  the  ESP  application  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  Additionally  the  NRC  staff  considered  all 
Fukushima  Near-Term  Task  Force  recommendations  contained  in  SECY-11-0124, 
“Recommended  Actions  To  Be  Taken  Without  Delay  From  The  Near-Term  Task  Force  Report” 
(NRC  201 1-TN4301 ;  NRC  201 1-TN4302),  for  applicability  to  the  PSEG  ESP  and  found  that 
most  were  outside  the  scope  of  site  suitability  requirements  for  the  ESP  review.  In  the  case  of 
the  flooding  and  seismic  reevaluations  components  of  Recommendation  2.1,  the  NRC  staff 


NUREG-2168 


5-98 


November  2015 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


determined  that  these  issues  were  adequately  addressed  in  the  application  as  noted  in  the 
following  text.  The  NRC  staffs  evaluation  of  the  Near-Term  Task  Force  recommendations  is 
provided  in  Chapter  20  of  the  Final  Safety  Evaluation  Report  (NRC  201 5-TN4369|ADAMS 
Accession  No.  ML15197A207|). 

The  severe  accident  evaluation  presented  later  in  this  section  draws  from  the  analyses 
developed  in  the  staffs  safety  review,  which  includes  consideration  of  severe  accidents  initiated 
by  external  events  and  those  that  involve  fission  product  releases.  The  staff  evaluation 
discusses  the  environmental  impacts  of  severe  accidents  in  terms  of  risk,  which  considers  the 
likelihood  of  both  a  severe  accident  and  its  consequences.  For  several  reasons  discussed 
below,  the  staff  has  determined  that  the  Fukushima  accident  and  the  NRC’s  implementation  of 
the  task  force  recommendations  do  not  change  the  staffs  conclusions  about  the  environmental 
impacts  of  design  basis  accidents  or  severe  accidents. 

Each  new  reactor  application  evaluates  the  natural  phenomena  that  are  pertinent  to  the  site  for 
the  proposed  reactor  design  by  applying  present-day  regulatory  guidance  and  methodologies. 
This  includes  the  determination  of  the  characteristics  of  the  flood  and  seismic  hazards.  With 
respect  to  flooding,  the  NRC  issued  a  letter  to  PSEG  documenting  the  need  for  PSEG  to 
provide  the  necessary  flood  hazard  analysis  in  the  SSAR  consistent  with  present-day  guidance 
and  methodologies  (NRC  2014-TN3589).  PSEG  addressed  the  NRC  staffs  needs  through  a 
series  of  RAI  responses  containing  technical  information  which  was  provided  into  Section  2.4  of 
the  SSAR  (NRC  2015-TN4283).  The  NRC  staff  reviewed  and  evaluated  digital  modeling  files, 
explanations  and  calculations  submitted  by  the  applicant  concerning  the  potential  for  flooding  at 
the  site  due  to  a  variety  of  causes  including  probable  maximum  precipitation,  probable 
maximum  flooding  on  rivers  and  streams,  potential  dam  failures,  maximum  surge  and  seiche 
flooding,  and  probable  maximum  tsunami.  Based  on  a  review  and  evaluation  of  the  applicant’s 
information,  the  NRC  staff  finds  that  the  applicant  appropriately  considered  flood-causing 
phenomena  and  their  combinations  that  are  relevant  for  the  PSEG  Site.  The  detailed  results  of 
the  NRC  staffs  safety  review  for  flooding  is  provided  for  public  inspection  in  Section  2.4, 
Hydrologic  Engineering,  of  the  Final  Safety  Evaluation  Report  (NRC  2015-TN4369|ADAMS 
Accession  No.  ML15197A207|). 

With  respect  to  the  consideration  of  severe  accidents  initiated  by  seismic  events,  PSEG 
submitted  its  response  (PSEG  2012-TN2905;  PSEG  2012-TN2906;  PSEG  2012-TN2907; 

PSEG  2013-TN2908;  PSEG  2013-TN2910)  to  the  staffs  seismic  hazard  RAI  (stemming  from 
the  first  RFI  topic)  (NRC  2012-TN2904).  In  this  RAI,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  evaluate 
the  impacts  of  the  newly  released  Central  and  Eastern  United  States  Seismic  Source 
Characterization  model,  as  documented  in  NUREG-21 15  (NRC  2012-TN3810),  on  the  PSEG 
Site-specific  seismic  hazard  calculation.  This  model  considers  the  latest  seismic  source 
information  for  the  Central  and  Eastern  United  States.  The  NRC  staff  reviewed  and  evaluated 
the  applicant’s  response,  which  was  incorporated  in  Section  2.5  of  the  SSAR  (NRC  2015- 
TN4283),  and  determined  that  the  applicant’s  analyses  of  vibratory  ground  motion  adequately 
characterized  the  PSEG  Site.  An  applicant  for  a  COL  or  CP  referencing  the  PSEG  Site  early 
site  permit,  is  expected  to  use  these  analyses  in  its  accident  analyses  and  design  margin 
determination.  The  detailed  results  of  the  NRC  staff’s  safety  review  for  seismic  events  is 
available  for  public  inspection  in  Section  2.5,  Geology,  Seismology,  and  Geotechnical 
Engineering,  of  the  Final  Safety  Evaluation  Report  (NRC  2015-TN4369|ML15197A207|).

In  addition  to  the  above  seismic  and  flooding  considerations,  the  safety  features  of  the  reactor 
designs  being  considered  further  support  the  conclusion  that  the  Fukushima  accident  does  not 
warrant  a  change  in  the  environmental  risks  of  severe  accidents  considered  in  this  PSEG  ESP 
EIS  analysis.  In  particular,  the  potential  design-related  vulnerabilities  raised  by  the  event  at 
Fukushima,  such  as  the  impact  of  the  beyond-design-basis  extended  loss  of  alternating  current 
(AC)  to  the  essential  and  nonessential  switchgear  buses,  would  not  materially  affect  the  current 
bounding  analysis  of  severe  accidents  for  the  PSEG  Site  because  the  planned  reactors  have 
been  designed  with  additional  capabilities  as  well  as  mitigating  strategies  to  withstand  such  a 
loss  of  power  and  prevent  and  mitigate  severe  accidents.  As  previously  noted  in  the  task  force 
report  for  one  of  the  designs  considered  in  the  ESP  application,  the  API  000  passive  safety 
systems  would  remove  the  decay  heat  from  the  reactor  core  upon  the  loss  of  alternating  and/or 
direct  current  electric  power  and  operate  to  maintain  adequate  core  cooling  for  a  period  of 
72  hours  without  further  operator  action,  unlike  the  facilities  at  the  Fukushima  site.  This  core 
cooling  by  the  passive  safety  systems  can  be  sustained  for  an  extended  period  beyond  72  hours 
where  the  only  operator  action  is  to  re-fill  the  internal  pool  that  provides  the  source  of  water  for 
the  passive  safety  systems.  Additional  details  are  provided  in  the  NRC  staffs  Safety  Evaluation 
Report  for  the  AP1000  design  certification,  NUREG-1793  Supplement  2  (NRC  201 1-TN2479). 

Other  reactor  designs  considered  by  PSEG  in  its  ER  rely  upon  active  safety  systems  and 
additional  coping  capabilities,  along  with  mitigating  strategies  for  a  beyond-design-basis  event 
such  as  an  extended  loss  of  AC  power  (NRC  2015-TN4280).  The  NRC  also  issued  orders  to 
the  construction  permit  and  design  certification  licensees  (77  FR  16091-TN2476;  77  FR  16082- 
TN1424).  The  US-APWR  and  U.S.  EPR  reactor  designs  that  are  currently  under  review  would 
satisfy  these  orders  before  their  certification.  If  the  ABWR  certified  design  is  proposed  for  a 
particular  site,  addressing  the  NRC  Fukushima,  then  related  orders  or  rules  would  be 
undertaken  as  part  of  the  site-specific  combined  or  operating  licensing  application  review 
process.  The  mitigation  strategies  for  beyond-design-basis  external  events  proposed  for  any 
new  reactor  application  would  be  evaluated  by  the  NRC  staff  against  the  functional 
requirements  of  NRC  Order  EA-1 2-049  as  described  in  Interim  Staff  Guidance  JLD-ISG-2012- 
01  (NRC  2012-TN3163).  In  accordance  with  the  Interim  Staff  Guidance,  future  COL  applicants 
would  be  responsible  for  describing  their  proposed  overall  implementation  of  these  mitigation 
strategies,  such  as  the  industry’s  “FLEX”  and  station  blackout  mitigating  strategies,  or  they  must 
provide  design  or  engineered  alternatives.  As  such,  at  the  time  of  a  COL  application,  PSEG 
would  need  to  document  how  the  selected  reactor  design  and  proposed  mitigation  strategies 
meet  the  requirements  of  the  orders. 

In  sum,  none  of  the  information  the  staff  has  identified  about  the  Fukushima  accident  or  the 
steps  taken  by  the  NRC  to  date  to  implement  the  task  force  recommendations  suggests  that  the 
seismic  and  flooding  hazards  or  the  available  mitigation  capability  (i.e. ,  passive  safety  systems) 
assumed  in  the  PSEG  ESP  EIS  analysis  of  severe  accidents  would  be  affected.  For  these 
reasons,  the  NRC’s  analysis  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  design  basis  and  severe  accidents 
presented  herein  remains  valid. 

This  section  discusses  (1 )  the  types  of  radioactive  materials;  (2)  the  paths  to  the  environment; 

(3)  the  relationship  between  radiation  dose  and  health  effects;  and  (4)  the  environmental 
impacts  of  reactor  accidents,  including  both  design  basis  accidents  (DBAs)  and  severe 
accidents.  The  environmental  impacts  of  accidents  during  transportation  of  spent  fuel  are 
discussed  in  Chapter  6.

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


The  potential  for  dispersion  of  radioactive  materials  in  the  environment  depends  on  the 
mechanical  forces  that  physically  transport  the  materials  and  on  the  physical  and  chemical 
forms  of  the  material.  Radioactive  material  exists  in  a  variety  of  physical  and  chemical  forms. 
The  majority  of  the  radioactive  material  in  the  fuel  is  in  the  form  of  nonvolatile  solids.  However, 
there  is  a  significant  amount  of  radioactive  material  in  the  form  of  volatile  solids  or  gases.  The 
gaseous  radioactive  materials  include  the  chemically  inert  noble  gases  (e.g.,  krypton  and 
xenon),  which  have  a  high  potential  for  release.  Radioactive  forms  of  iodine,  which  are  created 
in  substantial  quantities  in  the  fuel  by  fission,  are  volatile.  Other  radioactive  materials  formed 
during  the  operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  have  lower  volatilities  and,  therefore,  have  lower 
tendencies  to  escape  from  the  fuel  than  the  noble  gases  and  iodines. 

Radiation  dose  to  individuals  is  determined  by  their  proximity  to  radioactive  material,  the 
duration  of  their  exposure,  and  the  extent  to  which  they  are  shielded  from  the  radiation. 
Pathways  that  lead  to  radiation  exposure  include  (1)  external  radiation  from  radioactive  material 
in  the  air,  on  the  ground,  and  in  the  water;  (2)  inhalation  of  radioactive  material;  and 
(3)  ingestion  of  food  or  water  containing  material  initially  deposited  on  the  ground  and  in  water. 

Radiation  protection  experts  assume  that  any  amount  of  radiation  exposure  may  pose  some  risk 
of  causing  cancer  or  a  severe  hereditary  effect  and  that  the  risk  is  higher  for  higher  radiation 
exposures.  Therefore,  a  linear,  no-threshold  response  relationship  is  used  to  describe  the 
relationship  between  radiation  dose  and  detriments  such  as  cancer  induction.  A  report  by  the 
National  Research  Council,  the  BEIR  VII  report,  uses  the  linear,  no-threshold  dose  response 
model  as  a  basis  for  estimating  the  risks  from  low  doses  (National  Research  Council  2006- 
TN296).  This  approach  is  accepted  by  the  NRC  as  a  conservative  model  for  estimating  health 
risks  from  radiation  exposure,  recognizing  that  the  model  may  overestimate  those  risks. 

Physiological  effects  are  clinically  detectable  if  individuals  receive  radiation  exposure  resulting  in 
a  dose  greater  than  about  25  rad  over  a  short  period  of  time  (hours).  Doses  of  about  250  to 
500  rad  received  over  a  relatively  short  period  (hours  to  a  few  days)  can  be  expected  to  cause 
some  fatalities. 

5.11.1  Design  Basis  Accidents 

PSEG  evaluated  the  potential  consequences  of  postulated  accidents  to  demonstrate  that  an 
ABWR  unit,  two  API  000  units,  a  U.S.  EPR  unit,  or  a  US-APWR  unit  could  be  constructed  and 
operated  at  the  PSEG  Site  without  undue  risk  to  the  health  and  safety  of  the  public 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  These  evaluations  used  a  set  of  DBAs  representative  of  each  of  the 
reactor  designs  being  considered  for  the  PSEG  Site  and  site-specific  meteorological  data.  The 
set  of  accidents  covers  events  that  range  from  relatively  high  probability  of  occurrence  with 
relatively  low  consequences  to  relatively  low  probability  with  high  consequences. 

The  bases  for  analyses  of  postulated  accidents  for  these  four  designs  are  well  established 
because  these  reactors  are  being  reviewed  or  have  been  reviewed  in  the  NRC  advanced 
reactor  design  certification  process.  Potential  consequences  of  DBAs  are  evaluated  following 
procedures  outlined  in  regulatory  guides  and  standard  review  plans.  The  potential 
consequences  of  accidental  releases  depend  on  the  specific  radionuclides  released,  the  amount 
of  each  radionuclide  released,  and  the  meteorological  conditions.

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


As  stated  in  the  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  PSEG  applied  information  from  the  ABWR  DCD 
(GE  1997-TN2767),  where  the  source  terms  are  calculated  based  on  Regulatory  Guide  (RG) 
1.3,  Assumptions  Used  for  Evaluating  the  Potential  Radiological  Consequences  of  a  Loss  of 
Coolant  Accident  for  Boiling  Water  Reactors,  Revision  2  (NRC  1974-TN85);  RG  1.25, 
Assumptions  Used  for  Evaluating  the  Potential  Radiological  Consequences  of  a  Fuel  Handling 
Accident  in  the  Fuel  Handling  and  Storage  Facility  for  Boiling  and  Pressurized  Water  Reactors, 
Revision  0  (NRC  1972-TN87);  and  TID-14844,  Calculation  of  Distance  Factors  for  Power  and 
Test  Reactor  Sites  (DiNunno  et  al.  1962-TN21 ).  The  ABWR  source  terms  are  calculated  for  a 
power  level  of  4386  MW(t),  which  is  102  percent  of  4,300  MW(t)  (an  uprated  version  of  the 
standard  ABWR,  which  is  rated  at  4,005  MW(t)). 

PSEG  states  that  the  source  terms  for  the  API  000  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2012-TN2460) 
are  based  on  NUREG-1465,  Accident  Source  Terms  for  Light-Water  Nuclear  Power  Plants 
(NRC  1995-TN2766),  and  RG  1.183  (NRC  2000-TN517).  The  AP1000  source  terms  are 
calculated  for  a  power  level  of  3,468  MW(t),  which  is  102  percent  of  the  rated  core  power  of 
3,400  MW(t). 

PSEG  also  states  that  the  source  terms  for  the  U.S.  EPR  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280;  PSEG  2012- 
TN2460)  are  calculated  in  accordance  with  NUREG-0800  (NRC  2007-TN3036)  and  RG  1.183 
(NRC  2000-TN517).  The  U.S.  EPR  source  terms  are  calculated  for  a  reactor  power  of 
4,612  MW(t)  (4,590  MW(t)  rated  power  plus  22  MW(t)  heat  balance  measurement  uncertainty). 

PSEG  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  applied  information  from  the  US-APWR  DCD  (MHI  2008-TN3169), 
which  is  based  on  the  source  terms  methods  for  evaluating  potential  accidents  from  guidance  in 
NUREG-0800  (NRC  2007-TN3036)  and  RG  1.183  (NRC  2000-TN517).  The  US-APWR  source 
terms  are  calculated  for  a  reactor  power  of  4,555  MW(t)  (102  percent  of  the  rated  power  of 
4,466  MW(t)). 

For  environmental  reviews,  consequences  are  evaluated  assuming  realistic  meteorological 
conditions.  Meteorological  conditions  are  represented  in  these  consequence  analyses  by  an 
atmospheric  dispersion  factor,  which  is  also  referred  to  as  y/Q.  Acceptable  methods  of 
calculating  y/Q  for  DBAs  from  meteorological  data  are  set  forth  in  Regulatory  Guide  1 .145 
(NRC  1983-TN279).  Consistent  with  NUREG-1555  (NRC  2000-TN1 160),  the  50th  percentile 
y/Q  values  are  used  that  reflect  probable  accident  conditions. 

Table  5-21  lists  y/Q  values  pertinent  to  the  environmental  review  of  DBAs  for  the  PSEG  Site 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  first  column  lists  the  time  periods  and  boundaries  for  which  y/Q  and 
dose  estimates  are  needed.  For  the  exclusion  area  boundary,  the  postulated  DBA  dose  and  its 
atmospheric  dispersion  factor  are  calculated  for  a  short-term,  i.e.,  2  hours;  for  the  low  population 
zone,  they  are  calculated  for  the  course  of  the  accident,  i.e.,  30  days  composed  of  5  time 
periods.  The  second  column  lists  the  y/Q  values  presented  in  Tables  5.1 1-1-1, 7.1-38,  7.1-40, 
7.1-46,  and  7.1 .55  of  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG  calculated  the  y/Q  values 
listed  in  those  tables  using  onsite  meteorology  described  in  SSAR  Section  2.3  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4283). 

The  NRC  staff  reviewed  Section  2.9.3  meteorological  data  used  by  PSEG  and  the  PSEG 
atmospheric  dispersion  factors.  Based  on  these  reviews,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  the

Table  5-22,  Table  5-23,  Table  5-24,  and  Table  5-25  list  the  set  of  DBAs  considered  by  PSEG  for 
the  four  different  reactor  technologies  and  present  estimates  of  the  environmental 
consequences  of  each  accident  in  terms  of  total  effective  dose  equivalent  (TEDE).  TEDE  is 
estimated  by  the  sum  of  the  committed  effective  dose  equivalent  from  inhalation  and  the  deep 
dose  equivalent  from  external  exposure.  Table  5-22  is  for  the  US-APWR  design,  and  these 
values  are  from  Table  7.1-39  of  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Table  5-23  is  for  the  U.S. 
EPR,  and  these  values  are  from  Table  7.1-56  of  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Table  5-24  is  for  the  AP1000  (one  unit),  and  these  values  are  from  Tables  7.1-47  through  7.1-54 
of  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Finally,  Table  5-25  is  for  the  ABWR,  and  these  values 
are  from  Tables  7.1-41  through  7.1-45  of  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

(e)  The  level  of  activity  is  consistent  with  an  off-gas  release  rate  of  3.7  GBq/s  for  Case  1  and  14.8  GBq/s  for 
Case  2,  referenced  to  a  30-minute  decay.  The  iodine  concentrations  are  also  different  for  each  case. 

Source:  PSEG  2015-TN4280. 


Dose  conversion  factors  from  Federal  Guidance  Report  1 1  (Eckerman  et  al.  1988-TN68)  were 
used  to  calculate  the  committed  effective  dose  equivalent.  Similarly,  dose  conversion  factors 
from  Federal  Guidance  Report  12  (Eckerman  and  Ryman  1993-TN8)  were  used  to  calculate  the 
deep  dose  equivalent. 

The  Commission  has  determined  that  the  ABWR  meets  the  TEDE  dose  criteria  of  10  CFR  50.34 
(10  CFR  Part  52,  Appendix  A  [TN251];  10  CFR  Part  50-TN249).  Equivalent  TEDE  values  have 
been  estimated  for  ABWR  from  doses  reported  by  the  applicant  in  its  ER  by  multiplying  the 
thyroid  dose  by  a  factor  of  0.03  (the  organ  weighting  factor  for  the  thyroid)  and  adding  the 
product  to  the  whole  body  dose.  The  doses  are  also  converted  to  rems  from  the  original 
reported  values  in  sieverts  (Sv). 

The  NRC  staff  reviewed  the  PSEG  selection  of  DBAs  for  each  reactor  design  by  comparing  the 
accidents  listed  in  the  application  with  DBAs  considered  in  the  latest  respective  DCD  version 
released.  Although  some  enhancements  are  in  progress  with  these  design  certification 
documents,  no  significant  changes  in  information  pertaining  to  DBAs  are  anticipated  that  would 
alter  the  conclusions  presented  in  this  section.  The  US-APWR  DCD  is  Rev.  1  (MHI  2008- 
TN3169);  the  API 000  DCD  is  Rev.  17  (Westinghouse  2008-TN496);  the  U.S.  EPR  DCD  is  Rev. 
0  (AREVA  2007-TN1921 );  and  the  ABWR  is  Rev.  4  (GE  1997-TN2767).  The  API  000  final 
design  certification  was  based  on  DCD  Revision  19  (Westinghouse  2011-TN261),  and  the  DBAs 
in  PSEG’s  ER  for  the  API  000  (i.e.,  DCD  Rev.  17)  are  the  same.  DBAs  in  the  ER  are  the  same 
as  those  considered  in  the  design  certification;  therefore,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  set  of 
DBAs  is  appropriate.  In  addition,  the  NRC  staff  reviewed  the  calculation  of  the  site-specific 
consequences  of  DBAs  and  found  the  results  of  the  calculations  to  be  acceptable. 

There  are  no  environmental  criteria  related  to  the  potential  consequences  of  DBAs. 
Consequently,  the  review  criteria  used  in  the  NRC  staffs  safety  review  of  DBA  doses  are 
included  in  Table  5-22,  Table  5-23,  Table  5-24,  and  Table  5-25  to  illustrate  the  magnitude  of  the

calculated  environmental  consequences  (TEDE  doses).  In  all  cases,  the  calculated  TEDE 
values  are  considerably  smaller  than  the  TEDE  doses  used  as  safety  review  criteria. 
Considering  the  magnitude  of  the  doses  presented  in  Table  5-22,  Table  5-23,  Table  5-24  and 
Table  5-25,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  design  basis 
accidents  for  the  selected  reactor  designs  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  SMALL. 

NRC  staff  reviewed  PSEG  DBA  analysis  and  PSEG  Site-specific  data  in  PSEG  ER  for  the  four 
different  reactor  technologies  under  consideration  and  found  them  to  be  appropriate  and 
acceptable.  The  site-specific  analysis  results  demonstrate  that  all  US-APWR,  API 000, 

U.S.  EPR,  and  ABWR  accident  doses  meet  the  site  acceptance  criteria  of  10  CFR  50.34 
(TN249). 

The  results  indicate  the  environmental  risks  associated  with  DBAs  for  any  of  the  four  reactor 
technologies  considered  would  be  SMALL.  On  this  basis,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the 
environmental  consequences  of  DBAs  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  of  SMALL  significance  for 
any  of  the  four  reactor  technologies  considered. 

5.11.2  Severe  Accidents 

In  its  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  PSEG  considers  the  potential  consequences  of  severe 
accidents  for  four  different  reactor  technologies  at  the  PSEG  Site:  ABWR  (4,300  MW(t)), 

API 000  (two  units),  U.S.  EPR,  and  US-APWR.  Three  pathways  are  considered:  (1)  the 
atmospheric  pathway,  in  which  radioactive  material  is  released  to  the  air;  (2)  the  surface-water 
pathway,  in  which  airborne  radioactive  material  falls  out  on  open  bodies  of  water;  and  (3)  the 
groundwater  pathway,  in  which  groundwater  is  contaminated  by  a  basemat  melt-through  with 
subsequent  contamination  of  surface  water  by  the  groundwater. 

Because  the  PPE  does  not  include  source  terms  for  severe  accidents,  PSEG  bases  its 
evaluation  of  the  potential  environmental  consequences  for  the  atmospheric  and  surface  water 
ingestion  pathways  on  the  results  of  the  MELCOR  Accident  Consequence  Code  System 
(MACCS2)  computer  code  version  1.13.1  (Chanin  and  Young  1998-TN66)  using  source  term 
information  from  the  four  reactor  technologies  and  site-specific  meteorological,  population,  and 
land-use  data. 

The  MACCS  computer  code  (Chanin  et  al.  1990-TN2056;  Jow  et  al.  1990-TN526)  was 
developed  to  evaluate  the  potential  offsite  consequences  of  severe  accidents  for  the  sites 
covered  by  NUREG-1 1 50  (NRC  1 990-TN525).  MACCS2  is  the  version  of  MACCS  employed  in 
these  calculations  (Chanin  and  Young  1998-TN66).  The  MACCS  and  MACCS2  codes  evaluate 
the  consequences  of  atmospheric  releases  of  material  following  a  severe  accident.  The 
pathways  modeled  include  exposure  to  the  passing  plume,  exposure  to  material  deposited  on 
the  ground  and  skin,  inhalation  of  material  in  the  passing  plume  and  resuspended  from  the 
ground,  and  ingestion  of  contaminated  food  and  surface  water.  The  primary  enhancements  in 
MACCS2  are  that  MACCS2  has  (1)  a  flexible  emergency-response  model,  (2)  an  expanded 
library  of  radionuclides,  and  (3)  a  semidynamic  food-chain  model  (Chanin  and  Young  1998- 
TN66).

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


In  response  to  an  NRC  request  for  additional  information,  PSEG  provided  the  NRC  with  copies 
of  the  input  and  output  files  for  the  MACC2  computer  runs  (PSEG  2012-TN2462).  NRC  staff 
reviewed  the  input  and  output  files,  ran  independent  confirmatory  calculations  with  the  MACCS2 
code,  and  concurred  with  the  PSEG  results. 

Environmental  consequences  of  some  potential  surface-water  pathways  (e.g.,  swimming  and 
fishing)  are  not  evaluated  by  MACCS2.  PSEG  relied  on  generic  analyses  in  the  Generic 
Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants ,  NU  REG-1 437 
(NRC  2013-TN2654)  for  these  pathways.  Similarly,  the  MACCS2  code  does  not  address  the 
potential  environmental  consequences  of  the  groundwater  pathway. 

Three  types  of  severe  accident  consequences  were  assessed:  (1)  human  health,  (2)  economic 
costs,  and  (3)  land  area  affected  by  contamination.  Human  health  effects  are  expressed  in 
terms  of  the  number  of  cancers  that  might  be  expected  if  a  severe  accident  were  to  occur. 

These  effects  are  directly  related  to  the  cumulative  radiation  dose  received  by  the  general 
population.  MACCS2  estimates  both  early  fatalities  and  latent  cancer  fatalities.  Early  fatalities 
are  related  to  high  doses  or  dose  rates  and  can  be  expected  to  occur  within  a  year  of  exposure 
(Jow  et  al.  1990-TN526).  Latent  cancer  fatalities  are  related  to  exposure  of  a  large  number  of 
people  to  low  doses  and  dose  rates  and  can  be  expected  to  occur  after  a  latent  period  of 
several  (2  to  15)  years. 

Population  health-risk  estimates  are  based  on  the  population  distribution  within  a  50-mi  radius  of 
the  site.  Economic  costs  of  a  severe  accident  include  costs  associated  with  short-term 
relocation  of  people;  decontamination  of  property  and  equipment;  interdiction  of  food  supplies, 
land  and  equipment  use;  and  condemnation  of  property.  The  affected  land  area  is  a  measure  of 
the  areal  extent  of  the  residual  contamination  following  a  severe  accident.  Farmland 
decontamination  is  an  estimate  of  the  area  that  has  an  average  whole  body  dose  rate  for  the 
4-year  period  following  the  release  that  would  be  greater  than  0.005  Sv/yr  (0.5  rem/yr)  if  not 
reduced  by  decontamination  and  that  would  have  a  dose  rate  following  decontamination  of  less 
than  0.005  Sv/yr  (0.5  rem/yr).  Decontaminated  land  is  not  necessarily  suitable  for  farming. 

Risk  is  the  product  of  the  frequency  and  consequences  of  an  accident.  For  example,  the 
probability  of  a  severe  accident  (also  called  core  damage  frequency)  without  loss  of 
containment  for  a  US-APWR  (Release  Category  RC6)  is  estimated  to  be  1.1  *  10-6  per 
reactor-year  (Ryr)  for  internal  events.  The  cumulative  population  dose  associated  with  a  severe 
accident  without  loss  of  containment  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  calculated  to  be  16.9  person-Sv 
(1 ,690  person-rem).  The  population  dose  risk  for  this  release  class  is  the  product  of  1 .1  *  lO^6 
Ryr1  and  16.9  person-Sv  (1,690  person-rem),  which  equals  1.86  *  10~5  person-Sv  Ryr1 
(1.86  x  10~3  person-rem  Ryr1).  These  values  are  shown  in  Table  5-26. 

Core  damage  frequency  estimates  are  made  using  well  developed  methods  that  have  been 
updated  based  on  investigation  of  the  accident  at  Three  Mile  Island,  Unit  2,  and  research 
following  the  accident.  Core  damage  frequency  estimation  methods  used  to  generate  the 
estimates  presented  in  this  EIS  are  described  in  NUREG-1150,  Severe  Accident  Risk:  An 
Assessment  for  Five  U.S.  Nuclear  Power  Plants  (NRC  1990-TN525).  These  methods  explicitly 
consider  both  pre-accident  and  post-accident  human  errors.  The  core  damage  frequencies 
listed  in  this  EIS  are  those  estimated  for  the  US-APWR,  API  000  reactor,  U.S.  EPR,  and  ABWR

designs  as  part  of  the  design  certification  process.  The  following  sections  discuss  estimated 
risks  associated  with  the  air,  surface  water,  and  groundwater  pathways.  The  risks  presented  in 
the  following  tables  are  risks  per  year  of  reactor  operation. 

5. 7 1.2. 7  Air  Pathway 

The  MACCS2  code  directly  estimates  consequences  associated  with  releases  to  the  air 
pathway.  The  results  of  the  MACCS2  runs  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280)  for  the  four  reactor 
technologies  are  presented  in  Table  5-26,  Table  5-27,  Table  5-28,  and  Table  5-29.  For  the 
API  000  (Table  5-27),  values  for  one  unit  have  been  calculated.  Table  5-28  shows  the 
environmental  risks  for  the  U.S.  EPR.  The  estimated  risks  for  the  US-APWR  (Table  5-26)  are 
the  largest  of  the  four  reactor  technologies  considered,  and  the  estimated  risks  for  ABWR 
(Table  5-29)  are  the  lowest.  The  US-APWR  has  the  largest  values  for  all  of  the  categories  of 
the  tables:  core  damage  frequency,  population  dose,  early  fatalities  and  latent  cancer  fatalities, 
cost,  farm  land  decontamination,  and  population  dose  from  water  ingestion.  Therefore,  US- 
APWR  results  are  bounding  for  the  four  reactor  technologies  considered. 

The  core  damage  frequencies  given  in  the  prior  tables  include  internally  initiated  accident 
sequences.  Internally  initiated  accident  sequences  include  sequences  that  are  initiated  by 
human  error,  equipment  failures,  loss  of  offsite  power,  etc.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  core 
damage  frequencies  cited  by  PSEG  for  the  U.S.  EPR  and  US-APWR  are  those  from  the  Design 
Certification/Control  Document  and  Environmental  Report  submitted  as  part  of  the  application 
for  certification  of  the  U.S.  EPR  (AREVA  2007-TN1921 )  and  the  US-APWR  (MHI  2008-TN3169) 
reactor  designs.  The  NRC  staff  has  not  finished  its  evaluation  of  the  core  damage  frequencies. 
Consequently,  core  damage  frequencies  are  subject  to  change  as  the  design  certification  review 
continues.  Nevertheless,  core  damage  frequencies  in  these  tables  are  the  values  available  at 
the  time  PSEG  ER  was  prepared. 

Table  5-26,  Table  5-27,  Table  5-28,  and  Table  5-29  show  the  probability-weighted 
consequences  (i.e.,  risks)  of  severe  accidents  are  small  for  all  risk  categories  considered  for  a 
US-APWR,  an  API 000,  a  U.S.  EPR,  and  an  ABWR  located  on  the  PSEG  Site.  For  perspective, 
Table  5-30  and  Table  5-31  compare  the  health  risks  from  severe  accidents  for  a  US-APWR,  one 
API  000,  a  U.S.  EPR,  and  an  ABWR  at  the  PSEG  Site  with  the  risks  for  current-generation 
reactors  at  various  sites. 

In  Table  5-30,  the  health  risks  estimated  for  a  US-APWR,  an  AP1000,  a  U.S.  EPR,  and  an 
ABWR  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  compared  with  health-risk  estimates  for  the  five  reactors 
considered  in  NUREG-1150  (NRC  1990-TN525).  Although  risks  associated  with  both  internally 
and  externally  initiated  events  were  considered  for  the  Peach  Bottom  and  Surry  reactors  in 
NUREG-1150,  only  risks  associated  with  internally  initiated  events  are  presented  in  Table  5-30. 
The  resulting  health  risks  for  a  new  reactor  or  reactors  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  generally  lower 
than  the  risks  associated  with  current-generation  reactors  presented  in  NUREG-1150.

(f)  Cost  risk  includes  costs  associated  with  short-term  relocation  of  people,  decontamination,  interdiction,  and  condemnation.  It  does  not  include  costs  associated  with  health 
effects  (Jow  et  al.  1990-TN526). 

(g)  Land  risk  is  area  where  the  average  whole  body  dose  rate  for  the  4-year  period  following  the  accident  exceeds  0.005  Sv/yr  but  can  be  reduced  to  less  than  0.005  Sv/yr  by 
decontamination.

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


The  last  two  columns  of  Table  5-30  provide  average  individual  fatality  risk  estimates.  To  put 
these  estimates  into  context  for  the  environmental  analysis,  the  staff  compares  these  estimates 
to  the  safety  goals.  The  Commission  has  set  safety  goals  for  average  individual  early  fatality 
and  latent  cancer  fatality  risks  from  reactor  accidents  in  the  Safety  Goal  Policy  Statement 
(51  FR  30028-TN594).  These  goals  are  presented  here  solely  to  provide  a  point  of  reference 
for  the  environmental  analysis  and  do  not  serve  the  purpose  of  a  safety  analysis.  The  Policy 
Statement  expressed  the  Commission’s  policy  regarding  the  acceptance  level  of  radiological 
risk  from  nuclear  power  plant  operation  as  follows: 

•  Individual  members  of  the  public  should  be  provided  a  level  of  protection  from  the 
consequences  of  nuclear  power  plant  operation  such  that  individuals  bear  no  significant 
additional  risk  to  life  and  health. 

•  Societal  risks  to  life  and  health  from  nuclear  power  plant  operation  should  be  comparable  to 
or  less  than  the  risks  of  generating  electricity  by  viable  competing  technologies  and  should 
not  be  a  significant  addition  to  other  societal  risks. 

The  following  quantitative  health  objectives  are  used  in  determining  achievement  of  the  safety 
goals: 

•  The  risk  to  an  average  individual  in  the  vicinity  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  of  prompt  fatalities 
that  might  result  from  reactor  accidents  should  not  exceed  one-tenth  of  1  percent 

(0.1  percent)  of  the  sum  of  prompt  fatality  risks  resulting  from  other  accidents  to  which 
members  of  the  U.S.  population  are  generally  exposed. 

•  The  risk  to  the  population  in  the  area  near  a  nuclear  power  plant  of  cancer  fatalities  that 
might  result  from  nuclear  power  plant  operation  should  not  exceed  one-tenth  of  1  percent 
(0.1  percent)  of  the  sum  of  cancer  fatality  risks  resulting  from  all  other  causes. 

These  quantitative  health  objectives  are  translated  into  two  numerical  objectives,  as  follows: 

•  The  individual  risk  of  a  prompt  fatality  from  all  “other  accidents  to  which  members  of  the 
U.S.  population  are  generally  exposed,”  is  about  4.0  *  10~4  per  year,  including  a 

1.3  x  10~4  per  year  risk  associated  with  transportation  accidents  (NSC  2010-TN3240);  one- 
tenth  of  1  percent  of  these  figures  imply  that  the  individual  risk  of  prompt  fatality  from  a 
reactor  accident  should  be  less  than  4  *  10“7  per  Ryr. 

•  “The  sum  of  cancer  fatality  risks  resulting  from  all  other  causes”  for  an  individual  is  taken  to 
be  the  cancer  fatality  rate  in  the  U.S.,  which  is  about  1  in  500  or  2  *  10~3  per  year 

(Reed  2007-TN523);  one-tenth  of  1  percent  of  this  implies  that  the  risk  of  cancer  to  the 
population  in  the  area  near  a  nuclear  power  plant  because  of  its  operation  should  be  limited 
to  2  x  10~6  per  Ryr. 

MACCS2  calculates  average  individual  early  fatality  and  latent  cancer  fatality  risks.  The 
average  individual  early  fatality  risk  is  calculated  using  the  population  distribution  within  1  mi  of 
the  site  boundary.  The  average  individual  latent  cancer  fatality  risk  is  calculated  using  the 
population  distribution  within  1 0  mi  of  the  site.  For  sites  considered  in  NUREG-1 1 50 
(NRC  1990-TN525),  these  risks  were  well  below  the  Commission’s  safety  goals  (51  FR  30028- 
TN594).  In  general,  risks  calculated  for  the  US-APWR,  one  AP1000,  a  U.S.  EPR,  and  an 
ABWR  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  lower  than  the  risks  associated  with  the  current-generation 


NUREG-2168

Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


reactors  considered  in  NUREG-1 150.  While  the  US-APWR  design  at  the  PSEG  Site  may  have 
a  higher  average  individual  early  fatality  risk  than  two  of  the  reactors  assessed  in  NUREG- 
1 150,  all  risk  values  are  well  below  the  Commission’s  safety  goals. 

The  NRC  staff  compared  the  core  damage  frequency  and  population  dose  risk  estimate  for  a 
US-APWR,  an  API  000,  a  U.S.  EPR,  and  an  ABWR  at  the  PSEG  Site  with  statistics 
summarizing  the  results  of  contemporary  severe  accident  analyses  performed  for  over  70 
reactors  at  over  40  sites.  The  results  of  these  analyses  are  included  in  the  final  site-specific 
Supplements  1  through  49  to  the  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (GEIS)  for  License 
Renewal,  NUREG-1437  (NRC  2013-TN2654)  and  in  ERs  included  with  license  renewal 
applications  for  sites  for  which  supplements  have  not  been  published.  All  of  the  analyses  were 
completed  after  publication  of  NUREG-1 1 50  (NRC  1 990-TN525);  the  analyses  for  most  of  the 
reactors  used  MACCS2,  which  was  released  in  1997. 

Table  5-31  shows  that  core  damage  frequency  estimated  for  the  US-APWR,  API 000,  U.S. 

EPR,  and  ABWR  is  significantly  lower  than  those  of  current-generation  reactors.  Similarly,  the 
population  doses  estimated  for  any  of  the  four  reactor  technologies  considered  at  the  PSEG 
Site  are  well  below  the  mean  and  median  values  for  current-generation  reactors  that  have 
undergone  or  are  undergoing  license  renewal  and  are  lower  than  the  current  reactor  minimum 
except  for  the  US-APWR.  The  reason  the  US-APWR  population  dose  risk  is  larger  than  the 
current  reactor  minimum  (with  a  value  of  5.5  *  10~3  person-Sv/R-yr  for  Arkansas  Nuclear  One) 
is  due  to  the  larger  population  within  a  50-mi  range  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Population  projections  for 
the  year  2081  have  been  considered  for  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  year  2081 
has  been  selected  considering  the  40-year  operating  life  plus  the  potential  20-year  license 
extension.  The  startup  date  has  been  considered  in  the  year  2020.  The  population  projection 
for  the  year  2081  is  the  most  conservative  estimate  because  it  corresponds  to  the  highest 
population  value  at  the  end  of  the  site  operation,  assuming  the  population  always  increases  with 
time. 

Finally,  the  population  dose  risk  from  a  severe  accident  for  a  new  US-APWR  (this  is  the  reactor 
with  the  largest  population  dose  risk  of  the  four  reactors  considered)  at  the  PSEG  Site 
(1.15  x  10-2  person-Sv/Ryr)  may  be  compared  with  the  dose  risk  for  normal  operation  of  a 
US-APWR  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  population  dose  risk  from  normal  operation  of  a  US-APWR  is 
0.6  person-Sv/yr  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Thus,  the  population  dose  risk  associated  with  a 
severe  accident  is  less  than  the  dose  risk  associated  with  normal  operations. 

5.11.2.2  Surface-  Water  Path  ways 

Surface-water  pathways  are  an  extension  of  the  air  pathway.  These  pathways  cover  the  effects 
of  radioactive  material  deposited  on  open  bodies  of  water.  The  surface  water  pathways  of 
interest  include  exposure  to  external  radiation  from  submersion  in  water  and  activities  near  the 
water,  ingestion  of  water,  and  ingestion  of  fish  and  other  aquatic  creatures.  Of  these  pathways, 
the  MACCS2  code  evaluates  only  the  ingestion  of  contaminated  water.  The  risks  associated 
with  this  surface-water  pathway  calculated  for  the  PSEG  Site  are  included  in  the  last  column  of 
Table  5-26,  Table  5-27,  Table  5-28,  and  Table  5-29.  For  each  accident  class,  the  population 
dose  risk  from  ingestion  of  water  is  a  small  fraction  of  the  dose  risk  from  the  air  pathway.

NUREG-2168 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


Surface-water  pathways  involving  swimming,  fishing,  and  boating  are  not  modeled  by 

MACCS2.  Typical  population  exposure  risk  for  the  aquatic  food  pathway  for  sites  located 

on  small  rivers  was  considered  in  NUREG-1437  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  For  these  sites, 

the  population  dose  from  the  food  pathway  was  below  the  population  dose  from  the  air  pathway. 

Analysis  of  water-related  exposure  pathways  at  the  Fermi  reactor,  NUREG-0769 

(NRC  1981-TN675)  suggests  population  exposures  from  swimming  are  significantly  lower 

than  exposures  from  the  aquatic  ingestion  pathway. 

If  a  severe  accident  occurred  at  the  PSEG  Site,  it  is  likely  that  Federal,  State,  and  local  officials 
would  restrict  access  to  the  river/bay  near  the  site  and  in  contaminated  areas  around  the  site. 
These  actions  would  further  reduce  surface-water  pathway  exposures. 

Surface-water  bodies  within  the  50-mi  region  of  PSEG  Site  include  the  Chesapeake  Bay, 
Delaware  Bay,  Delaware  River,  Susquehanna  River,  Smyrna  River,  Schuylkill  River,  Cooper 
River,  and  the  several  reservoirs  listed  in  Table  2.3-3  of  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
The  tributary  streams  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  are  listed  in  Table  2.3-4  of  the  PSEG  ER 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  NRC  evaluated  doses  from  the  aquatic  food  pathway  (fishing)  for 
the  current  nuclear  fleet  discharging  to  various  bodies  of  water  in  NUREG-1437,  Generic 
Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants  (NRC  201 3-TN2654). 
The  NRC  evaluation  concluded  that  with  interdiction,  the  risk  associated  with  the  aquatic  food 
pathway  is  small  relative  to  the  atmospheric  pathway  for  most  sites  and  essentially  the  same  as 
the  atmospheric  pathway  for  the  few  sites  with  large  annual  aquatic  food  harvests.  The  new  site 
atmospheric  pathway  doses  are  lower  than  those  of  the  current  U.S.  nuclear  fleet;  therefore,  the 
doses  from  surface-water  sources  are  consistently  lower  for  a  new  reactor  at  the  PSEG  Site  as 
well. 

5.11.2.3  Groundwater  Path  way 

The  groundwater  pathway  involves  a  reactor  core  melt,  reactor  vessel  failure,  and  penetration  of 
the  floor  (basemat)  below  the  reactor  vessel.  Ultimately,  core  debris  reaches  the  groundwater 
where  soluble  radionuclides  are  transported  with  the  groundwater.  MACCS2  does  not  evaluate 
the  environmental  risks  associated  with  severe  accident  releases  of  radioactive  material  to 
groundwater.  However,  this  pathway  has  been  addressed  by  NUREG-1437  in  the  context  of 
renewal  of  licenses  for  current-generation  reactors  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  In  NUREG-1437,  the 
staff  assumes  a  1  *  10^  Ryr1  probability  of  occurrence  of  a  severe  accident  with  a  basemat 
melt-through  leading  to  potential  groundwater  contamination.  The  staff  concluded  that 
groundwater  contribution  to  risk  is  generally  a  small  fraction  of  the  risk  attributable  to  the 
atmospheric  pathway. 

The  NRC  staff  has  re-evaluated  its  assumption  of  a  1  *  10~4  Ryr1  probability  of  a  basemat 
melt-through.  The  NRC  staff  considers  the  1  x  10-4  probability  to  be  too  large  for  new  sites. 

The  probability  of  core  melt  with  basemat  melt-through  should  be  no  larger  than  the  total  core 
damage  frequency  estimate  for  the  reactor.  Table  5-30  gives  a  total  core  damage  frequency 
estimate  of  1.2  xIO-6  for  the  US-APWR,  the  largest  core  damage  frequency  of  the  four  reactor 
technologies  considered.  NUREG-1 150  (NRC  1990-TN525)  indicates  that  the  conditional 
probability  of  a  basemat  melt-through  ranges  from  0.05  to  0.25  for  current-generation  reactors. 
New  designs  include  features  to  reduce  the  probability  of  basemat  melt-through  in  the  event  of  a 


NUREG-2168 


5-116 


November  2015 


Operational  Impacts  at  the  Proposed  Site 


core  melt  accident.  On  this  basis,  the  staff  believes  a  basemat  melt-through  probability  of  less 
than  1.7  x  10~7  Ryr'  (MHI  2008-TN3317)  is  reasonable  and  still  conservative. 

The  groundwater  pathway  is  also  more  tortuous  and  affords  more  time  for  implementing 
protective  and  remedial  actions  and,  therefore,  results  in  a  lower  risk  to  the  public.  The  same 
consideration  applies  to  the  other  three  reactor  types  considered  at  the  PSEG  Site.  As  a  result, 
the  staff  concludes  the  risks  associated  with  releases  to  groundwater  are  sufficiently  small  that 
they  would  not  have  a  significant  effect  on  overall  risk  of  a  severe  accident  for  a  new  reactor  at 
the  PSEG  Site. 

5.11.2.4  Externally  Initiated  E vents 

The  analyses  described  above  are  specifically  for  internally  initiated  events.  PSEG’s  ER  and 
SSAR  do  not  address  potential  probability-weighted  consequences  (i.e.,  risk)  from  externally 
initiated  events.  The  consideration  of  externally  initiated  events  is  not  necessary  for  the  NRC 
staff  to  reach  a  finding  concerning  the  risks  of  the  reactor  designs  considered  by  PSEG  as 
related  to  the  risks  for  current-generation  reactors  from  severe  accidents.  However,  externally 
initiated  events  can  have  notable  contributions  to  the  total  averted  costs  dependent  on  the 
reactor  design.  As  outlined  by  10  CFR  52.79(a)(46)  (TN251 ),  Regulatory  Guide  1 .206 
(NRC  2007-TN3035),  and  Section  19.0  Revision  2  of  NUREG-0800  (NRC  2007-TN3036),  these 
events  are  required  to  be  included  in  the  Level  1  and  Level  2  of  the  probabilistic  risk 
assessment  and,  as  such,  would  be  considered  in  the  offsite  consequences  analysis  and  the 
severe  accident  mitigation  alternatives  (SAMA)  assessment.  Therefore,  the  NRC  staff  expects 
PSEG  would  include  externally  initiated  events  in  a  SAMA  assessment  for  a  combined  license 
application. 

5.11.2.5  Summary  of  Se  vere  A  ccident  Impacts 

The  NRC  staff  has  reviewed  the  analysis  in  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  and  conducted 
its  own  confirmatory  analysis  using  the  MACCS2  code.  The  results  of  the  PSEG  analysis  and 
the  NRC  analysis  indicate  that  the  environmental  risks  associated  with  severe  accidents  if  a 
US-APWR,  two  API 000  reactors,  a  U.S.  EPR,  or  an  ABWR  were  to  be  located  at  the  PSEG 
Site  would  be  small  compared  to  risks  associated  with  operation  of  the  current-generation 
reactors  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  other  sites.  These  risks  are  well  below  NRC  safety  goals.  On 
these  bases,  the  staff  concludes  the  probability-weighted  consequences  of  severe  accidents  at 
the  PSEG  Site  would  be  of  SMALL  significance  for  one  US-APWR  reactor,  one  U.S.  EPR 
reactor,  one  ABWR  reactor,  or  two  API 000  reactors. 

It  is  worth  noting  that  a  significant  effort  has  been  made  to  re-quantify  realistic  severe  accident 
source  terms  under  the  State-of-the-Art  Reactor  Consequence  Analysis  (SOARCA)  project 
(NRC  2012-TN3089;  NRC  2012-TN3092).  The  results  of  the  SOARCA  project  indicate  that 
source  term  timing  progresses  more  slowly,  and  releases  much  smaller  amounts  of  radioactive 
material  than  calculated  in  earlier  studies.  As  a  result,  public  health  consequences  from  severe 
nuclear  power  plant  accidents  modeled  in  SOARCA  are  smaller  than  previously  calculated. 

At  the  COL  stage,  the  NRC  staff  would  need  to  verify  that  the  environmental  impacts  of  severe 
accidents  from  the  selected  reactor  technology  at  the  PSEG  Site  remain  bounded  by  the

environmental  impacts  from  the  designs  and  their  respective  DCD  revisions  considered  in  this 
EIS.  For  the  COL  submission,  NRC  anticipates  that  applicant  analyses  will  be  comprehensive 
in  scope  and  will  address  all  applicable  internal  and  external  events  and  all  plant  operating 
modes. 

5.11.3  Severe  Accident  Mitigation  Alternatives 
This  section  is  not  required  for  an  ESP  permit. 

5.11.4  Summary  of  Postulated  Accident  Impacts 

The  NRC  staff  evaluated  the  environmental  impacts  from  both  DBAs  and  internally  initiated 
severe  accidents  for  four  different  reactor  technologies  (ABWR,  API  000  dual-unit,  U.S.  EPR, 
and  US-APWR)  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  NRC 
staff’s  independent  review,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  the  potential  environmental  impacts  from 
the  operation  of  the  four  reactor  designs  evaluated  in  this  EIS  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be 
SMALL.  However,  the  environmental  impacts  of  SAMAs  or  involving  other  reactor  designs

5.12  Measures  and  Controls  to  Limit  Adverse  Impacts  During  Operation 

In  its  evaluation  of  environmental  impacts  during  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site,  the  review  team  considered  PSEG’s  stated  intent  to  comply  with  the  following 
measures  and  controls  that  would  limit  adverse  environmental  impacts: 

•  compliance  with  applicable  Federal,  State,  and  local  laws,  ordinances,  and  regulations 
intended  to  prevent  or  minimize  adverse  environmental  impacts  (e.g.,  solid-waste 
management,  erosion  and  sediment  control,  air  emissions,  noise  control,  stormwater 
management,  discharge  prevention  and  response,  and  hazardous  material  management); 

•  compliance  with  applicable  requirements  of  permits  or  licenses  required  for  construction  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (e.g.,  Department  of  the  Army  Section  404 
Permit,  NPDES  permit); 

•  compliance  with  existing  PSEG  processes  and/or  procedures  applicable  for  environmental 
compliance  activities  during  construction  and  preconstruction  at  the  PSEG  Site  (e.g.,  solid- 
waste  management,  hazardous-waste  management,  and  discharge  prevention  and 
response); 

•  incorporation  of  environmental  requirements  into  construction  contracts;  and 

•  management  and  minimization  of  solid,  radiological,  chemical,  and  hazardous  wastes. 

Examples  of  PSEG  measures  to  minimize  impacts  and  protect  the  environment  include 

•  using  BMPs  for  construction  and  preconstruction  activities, 

•  implementing  plans  to  manage  stormwater  and  to  prevent  and  appropriately  address 
accidental  spills, 

•  managing  and/or  restoring  wetlands  and  marsh  creek  channels,  and

•  adhering  to  Federal,  State,  and  local  permitting  requirements. 

The  review  team  considered  these  measures  and  controls  in  its  evaluation  of  the  potential 
environmental  impacts  of  plant  operation.  Table  5-32  summarizes  the  measures  and  controls  to 
limit  adverse  impacts  during  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  based  on 
Table  5.10-1  in  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  and  other  information  provided  by  the 
applicant.  Some  measures  apply  to  more  than  one  impact  category.

Specific  Measures  and  Controls 


•  Minimize  potential  impacts  through  compliance  with  permitting 
requirements. 

•  Vegetation  management  primarily  through  mechanical  clearing,  with 
herbicide  application  in  accordance  with  integrated  pest  management 
plans:  herbicides  are  applied  by  trained  employees  licensed  to  apply 
herbicides 

•  Employees  trained  on  how  to  perform  work  in  a  manner  that  reduces 
adverse  environmental  impacts 

•  To  the  extent  feasible,  avoid  any  additional  disturbances  on  critical  or 
sensitive  terrestrial  habitats/species. 

•  As  practical,  machinery  use.  noise  suppression/mufflers,  and  vehicles 
are  maintained  to  reduce  emissions. 

•  Readily  available  spill  response  materials  and  personnel  trained  to 
respond  to,  clean  up,  and  report  spills 

•  Employees  trained  in  hazardous  materials/waste  procedures  to 
minimize  the  risk  of  spills 

•  Closed-cycle  cooling,  size  and  design  of  intake  screens  to  ensure  low 
approach  water  velocity  across  screens  of  less  than  0.5  fps  to  minimize 
impingement  and  entrainment. 

•  Discharges  to  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  are  expected  to  meet 
NJPDES  permitting  requirements.  Chemical  discharges  would  be 
monitored,  and  concentrations  are  expected  to  be  below  criteria  that 
are  protective  of  aquatic  life. 

•  Aquatic  resources  on  the  site  and  in  offsite  corridors  are  protected 
during  maintenance  activities  with  BMPs  that  comply  with  Federal  and 
State  permits  to  prevent  degradation  of  water  quality. 


•  Measures  to  mitigate  impacts  to  level  of  service  (LOS)  for  local  roads 
from  construction  traffic  would  be  left  in  place 

•  Coordination  with  NJDEP  on  final  modeling  of  air  emissions  and  ways 
to  reduce  PM25  emissions  to  meet  regulatory  limits 

•  Zoning  and  land-use  restriction  may  be  used  to  help  manage 
development. 

•  Train  and  appropriately  protect  employees  to  reduce  the  risk  or 
potential  exposure  to  noise. 

•  Monitor  release  of  waste  emissions  and  effluents. 

•  Train  workers  on  procedures  and  regulations  involving  waste 
emissions  and  effluents.

workforce. 

•  Increased  property  and  worker-related  taxes  can  help  offset  some  of 
the  problems  potentially  related  to  increased  population  such  as 
community  facilities  and  infrastructure,  police,  fire  protection,  and 
schools. 

•  Local  land  zoning  and  ordinances  can  help  mitigate  potential 
socioeconomic  growth  problems. 

•  Provide  appropriate  job  training  to  workers. 

•  Provide  onsite  services  for  emergency  first  aid,  and  conduct  regular 
health  and  safety  monitoring. 

•  No  mitigating  measures  or  controls  required  beyond  those  listed  above 

•  Follow  established  procedures  to  halt  work  and  consult  with  the  State 
Historic  Preservation  Office  if  a  potential  unanticipated  historic,  cultural, 
or  paleontological  resource  is  discovered. 

•  Obtain  air  permits  and  operate  systems  within  permit  limits,  and 
monitor  air  quality/emissions  as  required. 

•  Implement  site-wide  Safety  and  Medical  Program,  including  safety 
policies  and  safe  work  practices,  as  well  as  general  and  topic-specific 
training.

Calculated  doses  for  biota  other  than  humans  within  NCRP  and  IAEA 
guidelines. 

Implement  an  annual  offsite  Radiological  Environmental  Monitoring 
Program  to  evaluate  potential  exposures  and  doses  to  biota  other  than

Use  of  exposure  guidelines,  such  as  40  CFR  Part  190  (TN739),  that 
apply  to  members  of  the  public  in  unrestricted  areas,  is  considered  very 
conservative  when  evaluating  calculated  doses  to  biota  other  than 
humans.  The  ICRP  states  that "...  if  man  is  adequately  protected,  then 
other  living  things  are  also  likely  to  be  sufficiently  protected,”  and  uses 
human  protection  to  infer  environmental  protection  from  the  effects  of 
ionizing  radiation.

Also,  groundwater  flow  calculations  would  be  revised  once  the  final  plant  design  is 
determined  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  including  the  type  and  design  of  any  soil- 
retention  barrier  that  may  or  may  not  remain  in  place  around  the  power  block.  Details 
would  be  evaluated  in  the  combined  license  application  stage  of  the  application  process.

therefore,  have  a  MODERATE  physical  impact  on  aesthetic  resources. 

Demography  The  current  and  projected  populations  of  the  region  are  so  large  and  the  in-migrating  SMALL 

population  is  so  small  that  the  in-migrating  workers  would  represent  less  than  1%  of  the 
total  population  in  any  of  the  counties  where  these  employees  reside.  Therefore,  there 
would  be  no  demographic  impacts  of  operation  on  the  remainder  of  the  50-mi  region.
