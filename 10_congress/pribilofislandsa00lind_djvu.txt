EPIGRAPH 

There  is  history  as  others  view  it;  history  as  you  view  it;  and  history  that 

is  true  but  rarely  truly  understood. 


Song  of  St.  Paul 


Beloved  island  in  the  Bering  Sea 
In  dreams  at  night  you  drift  to  me 
On  wild,  cold  winds  that  bring  the  roar 
Of  stormy  seas  cast  on  your  shore. 

Again  I  hear  your  seabirds  cry, 

Your  teeming  seals  on  the  beach  nearby, 
Your  foxes  on  their  endless  roam, 
Your  church  bells  call  God’s  people  home. 

Once  more  I  see  your  children  play 
And  the  faces  of  friends  I  miss  today. 

I  know  your  roads  I  walked  along 
Will  see  me  back  to  hear  your  song. 

~ Ruth  M.  Sherwood ~

Preface 


At  the  outset  of  the  third  millennium  and  with  the  world’s  populations  routinely  talk¬ 
ing  about  a  global  economy,  it  seems  incredible  that  a  treeless,  five-island  archipelago 
with  a  total  area  of  about  seventy-eight  square  miles,1  situated  in  the  environmentally 
hostile  Bering  Sea  nearly  300  miles  from  the  Alaska  mainland,  could  have  contributed  to 
some  of  the  most  significant  political,  economic,  and  social  events  in  United  States  and 
Alaska  history.  The  Pribilof  Islands,  in  fact,  occasioned  the  most  historically  significant 
economic  event  for  the  United  States  in  the  early  era  of  the  Territory  of  Alaska,  prior  to 
the  1898  gold  rush.  Lost  in  the  annals  of  the  19th  century  gold  rush  and  the  20th  century 
oil  rush  is  the  equally  important,  but  earlier,  fur  rush  that  sought  the  luxurious  hides  not 
only  of  the  sea  otter,  but  also  of  the  northern  fur  seal  whose  principal  breeding  grounds 
are  on  the  Pribilof  Islands. 

On  July  27,  1868,  the  government  set  aside  the  Pribilof  Islands  as  a  “special  reserva¬ 
tion”  administered  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  for  the  protection  of  the  fur  seals. 
Briefly,  the  special  reservation  designation  restricted  access  to  the  islands  to  the  resident 
Aleut  [al-ee-ute]  Natives,  government  personnel,  and  contractors.  For  more  than  a  cen¬ 
tury  the  government  controlled  and/or  administered  an  industrial  monopoly  concerned 
with  the  harvesting  of  fur  seals  for  their  pelts.  The  Aleut  residents,  originally  brought 
to  the  uninhabited  islands  by  Russian  fur-traders  with  motives  similar  to  those  of  their 
American  successors,  served  as  the  primary  labor  force  on  the  islands.  The  U.S.  govern¬ 
ment  unwittingly  denied  the  Aleuts  many  of  their  civil  liberties.  Access  to  the  special 
reservation  required  Department  of  the  Treasury  or  its  successor  agency’s  approval. 

Government  reports,  correspondence,  maps,  photographs,  and  books  provided  the 
foundation  for  the  history  of  the  Pribilof  Islands  during  the  United  States  era.  Government 
and  non-government  scientists  sent  to  study  the  fur-seal  population  gave  detailed  de¬ 
scriptions  of  the  natural  history  of  these  remote  islands. 

The  sealskin  business  brought  tens  of  millions  of  dollars  to  the  U.S.  Treasury.  The 
islands  also  enriched  private  businessmen,  including  one  who  would  later  apply  his  earn¬ 
ings  toward  the  creation  of  the  California  signature  vineyard,  Inglenook.  In  the  1970s, 
Inglenook  became  the  Niebaum-Coppola  Winery,  and  subsequently  Rubicon,  owned  by 
film  producer  and  director  Francis  Ford  Coppola  and  his  wife,  Eleanor. 

After  Alaska  came  under  United  States  control,  law  enforcement  came  to  the  Pribilofs 
beginning  with  the  U.S.  Army,  soon  followed  by  the  U.S.  Revenue  Marine  Service  (which 
later  became  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard),  the  U.S.  Navy,  Treasury  agents,  company  lessee  agents, 
and  the  Aleut  people  themselves.  Potential  wars  or  military  conflicts  with  Great  Britain 
and  Japan  over  the  islands’  lucrative  fur-seal  trade  were  averted  diplomatically  in  the 
late  eighteenth  and  early  nineteenth  centuries,  respectively.  At  least  five  U.S.  Presidents 
participated  directly  in  decisions  related  to  the  Pribilof  Islands.  At  least  two  Presidents,

Preface 


Ulysses  Grant  and  Teddy  Roosevelt,  briefly  considered  exterminating  the  northern  fur- 
seal  herd  for  the  sake  of  peace. 

Over  the  decades,  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA) 
within  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  became  the  ultimate  successor  to  a  string  of 
federal  bureaucracies  responsible  for  the  special  reservation.  After  nearly  a  century  of 
complete  government  control,  the  islands’  Natives,  the  Aleuts  ( Unaagin ),2  were  acknowl¬ 
edged  as  the  rightful  holders  of  their  traditional  lands.  Several  federal  Acts  and  agree¬ 
ments,  such  as  The  Fur-Seal  Act  of  1966  (Public  Law  89-702)  and  its  1983  amendment, 
the  Alaska  Native  Claims  Settlement  Act  of  1971,  and  the  Transfer  of  Property  Agreement 
of  1984,  directed  the  transfer  of  public  lands  to  the  Aleuts.  Much  of  these  lands  lay  within 
the  Seal  Islands  National  Historic  Landmark  created  in  1966  under  the  National  Historic 
Preservation  Act  of  1966. 

Slow  progress  ensued  toward  the  completion  of  the  land  transfers.  During  the  interim, 
in  the  summer  of  1989  the  State  of  Alaska’s  Department  of  Environmental  Conservation 
(DEC)  issued  a  Notice  of  Violation  against  NOAA  for  an  oil  sheen  release  along  a  shore¬ 
line  at  St.  Paul  Island.  This  incident  motivated  one  of  the  island’s  land  recipients  to  ex¬ 
press  concern  about  other  potential  environmental  quality  issues  on  properties  being 
transferred  to  the  Aleuts.  Leaders  at  St.  George  Island  expressed  similar  concerns,  even 
though  all  appropriate  former  federal  property  had  already  been  transferred  to  them. 

In  response  to  these  environmental  concerns,  the  United  States  Environmental 
Protection  Agency  (EPA)  in  1992  launched  a  preliminary  investigation  at  both  islands 
to  assess  potential  contamination  and  liability  under  the  Comprehensive  Environmental 
Response,  Compensation,  and  Liability  Act  (CERCLA),  popularly  known  as  Superfund, 
and  the  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act  (RCRA).  In  1994,  EPA  issued  its  de¬ 
termination  that  no  contamination  posed  an  unacceptable  risk  to  human  health  or  the 
environment  under  CERCLA  or  RCRA. 

Unsatisfied  with  EPA’s  determination,  the  island  leaders  continued  to  allege  that  the 
United  States  government  had  caused  environmental  quality  violations.  Acknowledging 
a  basis  in  fact,  the  United  States  government  waived  its  sovereignty  and  NOAA  entered 
into  the  Pribilof  Islands  Environmental  Restoration  Agreement,  commonly  referred  to 
as  the  Two-Party  Agreement  (TPA)  with  the  State  of  Alaska  on  January  26,  1996.  The 
TPA  coincided  with  a  congressional  mandate,  Public  Law  104-91,  signed  by  President 
Clinton  on  January  6,  1996.  Section  3(c)  of  PL.  104-91,  entitled  “Resolution  of  Federal 
Responsibilities,”  required  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  to  clean  up  contaminants,  primar¬ 
ily  petroleum,  and  debris,  such  as  landfills,  on  the  Pribilof  Island  properties  left  by  the 
government  during  its  operation  of  the  commercial  fur-seal  industry. 

In  1999,  NOAA  directed  its  Director  of  the  Office  of  Response  and  Restoration,  David 
Kennedy,  to  address  the  matter  of  environmental  restoration.  Mr.  Kennedy  selected  the 
co-author  of  this  book,  John  Lindsay,  to  manage  the  undertaking.  During  the  course  of 
pieparations  the  agency  recognized  that  the  environmental  restoration  would  also  re- 
quiie  extensive  research  into  the  history  of  petroleum  contamination,  infrastructure  de¬ 
velopment,  industrial  debris,  and  solid  waste  landfills  on  the  islands.  As  a  result,  NOAA

Preface 


contracted  with  the  senior  author,  Betty  Lindsay,  a  genealogist  and  historical  researcher, 
to  research  and  compile  materials  about  the  history  of  the  Pribilof  Islands.  Subsequent  to 
her  contract,  it  was  learned  that  both  the  environmental  restoration  activities  on  public 
lands  and  within  a  National  Historic  Landmark,  and  the  property  transfer  from  public 
to  private  entities,  demanded  compliance  with  requirements  under  Section  106  of  the 
National  Historic  Preservation  Act  of  1966,  as  amended. 

The  initial  historical  research  recognized  that  fur-seal  management  and  science,  and 
issues  concerning  civil  rights  abuses  by  the  government,  overshadowed  the  more  personal 
aspects  and  sacrifices  that  individual  people  contributed  to  the  Pribilof  Islands’  history. 

During  the  first  fifty  years  of  American  possession,  the  Pribilof  Islands,  also  known 
as  the  Seal  or  Mist  Islands,  offered  up  many  stories  of  wealth,  political  intrigue,  romance, 
adventure,  and  tragedy.  They  often  appeared  in  such  publications  as  Harpers  and  Frank 
Leslie’s  Illustrated  Newspaper,  or  as  front  page  news  in  such  prestigious  outlets  as  the 
New  York  Times  and  the  Washington  Post.  Many  fascinating  people  and  events  would 
become  the  central  themes  of  novels,  poems,  music,  and  even  Hollywood  movies. 

Stories  about  northern  fur-seal  management,  harvesting,  and  the  health  and  welfare 
of  the  fur  seals  fill  volumes,  as  demonstrated  by  publications  like  History  of  Scientific  Study 
(Scheffer  et  al.,1984)  and  the  more  recent  The  Northern  Fur  Seal  (Callorhinus  ursinus):  A 
Bibliography  (Scott  et  al.,  2006)  and  Pribilof  Islands,  Alaska:  An  Annotated  Bibliography 
(Lindsay  and  Sclater,  2009).  Other  volumes  focused  on  the  tragedies  befalling  the  Aleuts 
who  ‘slaved’  for  Russian  and  American  fur-traders,  e.g.,  Torrey  (1978),  Slaves  of  the 
Harvest:  The  Story  of  the  Pribilof  Aleuts;  and  Jones  (1980),  A  Century  of  Servitude)  and 
on  their  relocation  during  WWII,  e.g.,  Kirtland  and  Coffin  (1981),  The  Relocation  and 
Internment  of  the  Aleuts  During  World  War  II,  and  Kohlhoff  (1995),  When  the  Wind  was 
a  River.  Several  film  documentaries  focused  on  these  subjects  as  well,  such  as  Islands 
of  Time  (Patricia  Stanley,  producer,  and  Dennis  Remick,  writer;  Fort  Yukon,  AI<:  Silky 
Way  Productions),  Aleut  Evacuation:  The  Untold  War  Story  (VHS;  Michael  and  Mary 
Jo  Thill,  producers;  Girdwood,  AI<:  Gaff  Rigged  Productions,  1992),  and  The  Aleut  Story 
(DVD;  Marla  Williams, producer  and  writer;  Anchorage,  AI<:  Sprokettheads,  2005).  More 
recent  films  such  as  The  Aleutians:  Cradle  of  the  Storms  (DVD;  Michael  Single,  producer, 
and  Beth  Harrington,  producer  and  writer;  Natural  History  New  Zealand  Ltd.,  2001,  and 
Oregon  Public  Broadcasting,  2002)  and  People  of  the  Seal  (DVD;  John  A.  Lindsay,  pro¬ 
ducer  and  writer,  and  Kate  Raisz,  writer;  Seattle,  WA:  NOAA,  2009),  sought  to  portray 
a  broader  cultural  heritage  perspective  on  the  Aleut  people.  During  the  1970s  and  early 
1980s,  the  Pribilof  Aleuts  came  under  attack  for  their  desire  to  pursue  their  only  signifi¬ 
cant  means  of  livelihood— fur  sealing— as  portrayed  in  a  1971  NBC  News  documentary 
Man’s  Thumb  on  Nature’s  Balance  hosted  by  Jack  Perkins.  The  documentaries  sought  to 
bring  a  human  face  to  the  story  of  the  Pribilofs  and  an  understanding  of  the  injustices  and 
indignities  suffered  by  so  many  on  these  remote  and  beautiful  sub-arctic  islands. 

Taken  collectively,  “The  People”  referred  to  in  the  book’s  title  include  not  only  the 
Aleuts,  but  government  officials,  businessmen,  scientists,  natural  historians,  church  of¬ 
ficials,  and  others  who  represent  the  human  experience  on  the  Pribilof  Islands.  When

Preface 


human  beings  are  involved  they  make  history,  and  human  history  is  made  up  of  both 
tragedy  and  comedy.  The  Pribilof  Islands’  history  is  full  of  each.  The  focus  of  this  book 
then  is  on  those  people  who  lived  on,  worked  at,  or  otherwise  influenced  and  shaped  the 
social,  political,  economic,  scientific,  and  natural  history  fabric  of  these  Pribilof  Islands. 

After  attempting  several  approaches  to  presenting  the  Pribilof  Islands’  human  his¬ 
tory,  the  senior  author  elected  to  illustrate  it  by  using  biographical  sketches,  including  in¬ 
dividual  genealogies  and  census  records  and  illustrations.  More  in-depth  Aleut  genealo¬ 
gies  and  census  records,  enhanced  with  illustrations,  are  presented  in  a  separate  volume 
{Pribilof  Islands,  Alaska:  Genealogy  and  Census,  2009). 

The  biographies,  genealogy  and  census  manuscripts  took  form  subsequent  to  the 
senior  author’s  contract  with  NOAA.  Manuscript  development  utilized  her  experience  in 
the  areas  of  genealogical  research  and  mathematics.  Her  personal  and  electronic  research 
forays  into  many  national  and  international  archival  collections  over  the  past  eight  years 
synthesized  her  original  vision.  The  biographical  stories  rely  heavily  on  quotes  from  in¬ 
dividuals  whose  lives  were  touched  by  the  Pribilof  Islands,  whether  directly  or  indirectly. 
The  stories  also  rely  heavily  on  “headquarters  history”  as  opposed  to  “grassroots  history,” 
as  anthropologist  William  S.  Laughlin  distinguished  the  two  source  types.3 

Not  unexpectedly,  challenges  in  the  research  involved  wading  through  untold  num¬ 
bers  of  “headquarters”  documents  that  used  the  popular  practice  of  identifying  gov¬ 
ernment  officials  only  by  their  initials.  The  senior  author  employed  numerous  research 
techniques  to  uncover  the  identities  of  these  officials.  Clues  used  to  trace  their  identities 
and  biographies  included  their  mention  in  various  records  of  formal  residences,  an  indi¬ 
vidual’s  age  during  service,  and  the  names  of  wives.  Search  applications  relied  on  various 
name  spellings.  A  list  of  approaches  taken  is  too  long  for  recounting  here. 

The  volume’s  temporal  focus  spans  the  period  from  the  United  States’  1867  purchase 
of  Alaska  to  1983,  which  was  the  end  of  federal  administration  on  the  Pribilof  Islands.  An 
emphasis  was  placed  on  identifying  individuals  of  the  Unaagin,  or  Aleut  inhabitants  of  the 
Pribilof  Islands,  using  biographical  information  contained  in  the  “headquarters  history.” 
For  the  period  covered  by  this  book,  the  “grassroots”  history  of  the  Unaagin  was  derived 
from  members  of  the  Pribilof  Islands  community  and  published  historical  records.  Also, 
while  the  focus  is  on  a  116-year  period  of  federal  administration,  some  important  events 
and  individuals  in  the  Pribilof  Islands’  story  are  included  from  the  Russian  period,  which 
began  in  1786.  The  biographical  sketches  are  almost  exclusively  limited  to  those  persons 
who  have  died. 

In  2001,  NOAA,  working  with  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey,  created  the  first  large-scale 
(1:25,000)  topographic  relief  maps  of  the  largest  two  Pribilof  Islands,  St.  George  and  St. 
Paul.  In  that  undertaking,  an  attempt  to  apply  Unangam  Tunuu  (Aleut  language)  to  place 
names  of  various  topographic  features  met  with  moderate  success.  Names  in  Unangam 
Tunuu,  as  well  as  Russian  words  and  text,  are  inserted  throughout  this  book  as  appro¬ 
priate.  [Note:  Beginning  with  the  Introduction,  foreign  or  Unangan  words  are  italicized 
on  their  first  use.]  They  are  intended  to  convey  an  appreciation  for  and  maintenance  of 
the  Unangam  (possessive  form  of  Unangan  [oo-nung-an],  the  Aleut  people)  cultural  iden-

Preface 


tity  and  heritage.  We  note  that  current  attempts  to  revive  Unangam  heritage  by  today’s 
Unangan  has  led  to  some  variant  translations  among  authors;  and  we  apologize  if  our 
usage  fails  to  comply  with  strict  standards. 

During  the  course  of  developing  the  manuscript,  we  debated  whether  to  emphasize 
only  the  positive  contributions  made  by  so  many,  to  the  exclusion  of  those  elements  that 
were  less  praiseworthy.  We  decided  that  the  Pribilof  Islands’  story,  because  of  its  public 
administration,  should  be  an  open  exposition  of  human  nature  as  it  appeared  in  the  his¬ 
tory  of  this  microcosm  of  American  society.4  The  motto  Past  is  Prologue  above  the  entry¬ 
way  to  the  National  Archives  in  Washington,  D.C.,  seems  apropos.  The  errors  of  the  past 
should  provide  purposeful  and  valuable  insights  to  the  present  and  the  future,  lest  others 
drift  and  tumble  over  the  same  cataracts  and  suffer  again  the  same  inequities,  whether  by 
the  government’s  or  their  own  hands. 

One  major  caveat  that  begs  understanding  of  this  present  work  is  that  it  is  only  a 
small  portion  in  the  relative  enormity  of  this  undertaking.  The  work  typically  fails  to  rep¬ 
resent  the  full  scope  of  contributions  of  any  individual  or  of  all  the  persons  who  were  a 
part  of  the  history  of  the  Pribilof  Islands.  The  number  of  individuals  is  too  daunting  and 
the  written  record  too  voluminous  and  dispersed  to  allow  for  adequate  coverage  within 
the  time  limits  set  for  this  project.  Lastly,  the  post-WWII  period,  through  the  termination 
of  government  administration  in  1983,  was  one  of  great  change  for  the  Pribilof  Natives. 
Much  more  could  be  written  about  the  individual  sacrifices  and  contributions  of  that 
period. 

The  Pribilovians  have  an  outstanding  heritage  upon  which  they  can  build  and  guide 
their  own  lives  for  a  better  tomorrow.  We  hope  this  work  will  serve  them  well,  as  they 
continue  to  make  history. 

Comments  about  the  Narrative  Text 

This  volume  relies  heavily  upon  the  words  of  those  who  lived  during  the  times  covered, 
for  their  observations  and  expressions  cannot  be  better  stated,  and  it  lessens  the  op¬ 
portunity  of  misstating  certain  facts.  We  have  left  most  words  the  way  they  originally 
appeared  in  the  various  documents.  Occasionally,  handwritten  documents  were  difficult 
to  interpret.  We  either  placed  a  question  mark  [?]  following  the  suspect  word,  or  stated 
that  it  was  indecipherable.  We  used  [sic]  relatively  sparingly  in  the  final  version,  although 
it  was  applied  frequently  in  drafts  because  reviewers  constantly  challenged  questionable 
spellings  or  proper  names.  For  example,  Seal  Islands  is  considered  a  proper  name,  but 
many  writers  during  the  period  spelled  it  in  lower  case.  Typically  we  corrected  obvious 
misspellings,  such  as  “ot”  to  “to,”  or  “htey”  to  “they.”  We  tried  to  leave  punctuation  as  it 
was  or  wasn’t  included,  but  occasionally  the  temptation  was  too  great  and  we  may  have 
inadvertently  amended  it.  Re-examining  the  records  was  too  onerous  a  task  to  justify  cor¬ 
recting  for  a  comma  that  should  or  should  not  have  been  there.

Internet  Research 

The  World  Wide  Web  afforded  ample  opportunity  to  expedite  historical  research  on  nu¬ 
merous  topics,  especially  genealogy,  biography,  and  geographical  locations.  Internet  sites 
come  and  go,  and  many  are  periodically  updated.  Herein,  web  addresses  utilized  in  the 
research  are  provided  in  the  endnotes.  The  date  on  which  a  website’s  information  was 
accessed  follows  the  address  in  parentheses,  although  we  did  not  strictly  adhere  to  this 
convention.  We  cannot  guarantee  that  by  the  time  the  reader  attempts  to  access  a  website 
cited  in  this  book,  the  information  will  be  available  or  the  same. 

Considerable  genealogical  research  relied  upon  the  following  subscription  web¬ 
sites:  GaleNet  (http://galenet.gale.com);  Ancestry.com  (http://www.ancestry.com);  and 
Ancestry  World  Tree  at  Ancestry.com  (http://www.ancestry.com/trees/awt/main.aspx). 
Public  libraries  typically  have  licensed  access  to  such  sites,  and  some  libraries  arrange  for 
home  access  for  some  patrons  and  students.  The  authors  also  used  the  GaleNet  product

We  want  to  thank  everyone  who  made  this  book  possible.  We  begin  by  saying  a  special 
thank  you  to  the  people  of  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  islands.  Some  of  you  answered  what 
may  have  seemed  unending  streams  of  questions  or  requests  for  written  records,  photo¬ 
graphs,  and  illustrations.  Even  though  Betty’s  trip  to  St.  Paul  Island  in  the  year  2000  was 
not  for  research,  it  gave  her  the  pleasure  of  meeting  the  people  themselves  at  an  island 
picnic  and  in  some  of  their  homes  and  provided  her  inspiration  to  write  this  and  other 
books  about  the  Pribilof  Islands.  Everyone  was  friendly  and  forthcoming  with  histori¬ 
cal  stories  and  traditions.  Betty  especially  wants  to  acknowledge  conversations  with  and 
access  to  historical  material  provided  by  librarian  Anita  Carden  and  her  husband,  School 
Superintendent  Jim  Carden,  former  City  Manager  John  R.  Merculief,  and  City  Clerk 
Phyllis  Swetzof,  as  well  as  the  kindness  of  Darlene  and  her  husband  John  Melovidov,  who 
invited  her  to  tea  and  surprised  her  with  firsthand  stories  about  the  islands. 

We  are  especially  indebted  to  Judith  Bittner  and  Joan  “Jo”  Anston,  Alaska  Office  of 
History  and  Archaeology,  who  provided  guidance  and  encouragement  that  led  to  the 
publication  of  this  book.  Also  Sonja  Kromann,  librarian  of  the  NOAA  Marine  Mammal 
Library,  Seattle,  Washington,  who  was  there  to  answer  our  many  questions  and  guide  us 
through  the  library’s  Fur-Seal  Archives.  We  are  very  grateful  to  the  staff  at  the  National 
Archives  and  Records  Administration  (NARA),  Pacific  Alaska  Region  in  Anchorage, 
Alaska,  especially  Bruce  Parham  and  Diana  Kodiak,  who  brought  so  many  records  to  our 
attention  and  labored  for  days  at  the  photocopier;  Henry  Gwiazda  in  the  Cartographic 
Section  at  the  NARA  repository  in  Washington,  D.C.;  and  Bill  Greathouse  at  the  NARA  re¬ 
pository  in  Seattle,  Washington.  We  are  indebted  to  the  following  members  of  the  Pribilof 
community  for  their  contributions  to  several  of  the  biographies:  Aquilina  Lestenkoff, 
Phyllis  Swetzof,  Ron  Philemonof,  Piama  Merculief,  and  Larry  Merculieff. 

We  searched  many  archives  and  libraries  both  electronically  and  in  person.  We 
found  materials  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  almost  every  state  in  the  nation.  We  give  spe¬ 
cial  thanks  to  Ellen  Alers,  Smithsonian  Institution  Archives;  Dave  Bergevin,  Smithsonian 
Photographic  Services;  Vyrtis  Thomas,  Susan  McElrath,  Gina  Rappaport,  and  Robert

The  fur-seal  fisheries  of  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  Island  are  the  key  to  control  all  the  resources  of  northern 
and  western  Alaska  and  the  forty  thousand  Indians  thereon.  Whichever  party — the  government  or  the 
monopolists — gets  control  of  those  fisheries,  with  their  assured  income  of  a  half  a  million  dollars  yearly,  and 
the  commercial  power  which  accompanies  it,  will  be  virtually  masters  of  both  the  trade  and  the  Indians  for 
the  next  ten  or  twenty  years. 


Vincent  Colyer,  United  States  Special  Indian  Commissioner, 
Report  of  the  Commissioner  of  Indian  Affairs,  November  1869,  561. 


Introduction 


THE  Seal  Islands  of  Alaska,  known  today  as  the  Pribilof  Islands,  arose  from  molten 
magma  flowing  through  fractures  in  the  floor  of  the  central  Bering  Sea.  St.  George  Island 
was  created  more  than  two  million  years  ago;  St.  Paul  Island’s  genesis  began  only  750,000 
years  before  the  present.  Approximately  9,000  years  ago,  pioneers  began  arriving  on  the 
Alaska  Peninsula  and  some  of  the  167  or  so  islands — the  Aleutian  Island  chain — that 
stretch  nearly  1,200  miles  toward  the  Russian  coastline.  Little  did  these  pioneers  realize 
that  they  were  headed  back  toward  the  land  of  their  ancestral  origin,  the  Asian  conti¬ 
nent.  Habitation  along  the  archipelago  was  suitable  only  for  a  people  who  could  master 
the  sea.  The  unique  population  of  settlers  with  sufficient  courage,  stamina,  and  intellect 
to  occupy  the  Aleutian  Islands  chain  eventually  referred  to  themselves  as  Unangan  or 
Unangas,  depending  upon  whether  they  spoke  the  eastern  or  central  Aleutian  dialect  (a 
western  or  Attuan  dialect  is  now  considered  extinct,  Bergsland  [1959]).  In  English,  those 
words  translate  simply  as  “the  people,”  which  is  how  many  indigenous  groups  designate 
themselves.  However,  Bergsland  {Aleut  Dictionary,  444)  suggested  Unangan  derives  from 
“seasider.”1  In  the  mid-eighteenth  century,  the  Russians  “discovered”  these  islands  and 
referred  to  the  inhabitants  as  “marine  Cossacks,”  or  “Aleuts.” 

In  1741,  Captains  Vitus  Bering  and  Gregorii  Chirikov  sailed  eastward  from  Kamchatka, 
Siberia,  into  the  Kamchatkan  Sea  (aka  Sea  of  Kamchatka)  under  the  Russian  tsarist  expan¬ 
sionist  philosophy  fostered  by  Peter  the  Great  and  subsequently  promoted  by  Empress 
Anna  Ioannovna  in  1740  and  her  successor,  Empress  Elizabeth,  in  1741.  Although  many 
adventurous  sailors,  including  Chirikov  and  naturalist  Georg  Wilhelm  Steller,  survived 
to  return  to  Russia,  Bering  and  others  died  from  disease,  attacks  by  indigenous  peoples, 
and  the  perils  unleashed  by  an  extremely  hostile  environment.  But  the  legacy  left  by  these 
sailors  encouraged  others  to  explore  what  became  known  as  the  Bering  Sea,  including 
the  islands  between  it  and  the  North  Pacific  Ocean.  The  Aleutian  Islands  yielded  con¬ 
siderable  wealth  in  the  form  of  sea-otter  pelts,  known  more  romantically  as  “soft  gold.” 
Russian  fur  hunters  and  traders— the  promyshlenniki— forced  the  Aleuts  to  compromise 
their  ancestral  ethos  of  conservation  and  to  ply  their  marine-cultural  skills  to  meet  the 
Russians’  avaricious  needs.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Eventually,  sea  otters  became  nearly  extinct  in  Alaska  and  elsewhere.  Fortunately  for 
the  promyshlenniki,  the  “soft  silver”  of  the  sea  bear,  as  Georg  Steller  had  described  it,  or 
northern  fur  seal  ( Callorhinus  ursinus),  offered  a  lucrative  alternative.  Fur  seals  had  been 
swimming  through  the  waters  of  the  Aleutian  Islands  for  as  long  as  the  Aleuts  could  re¬ 
member.  At  first  under  Russian  domination,  the  Aleuts  killed  relatively  small  numbers, 
giving  some  of  the  fur-seal  pelts  to  the  Russians,  who  then  traded  them  in  Russia  and 
China.  As  the  trade  value  of  the  seal  pelts  increased,  the  Russians  demanded  more  of 
them  from  the  Aleut  hunters. 

No  one  really  knew  where  the  seals  migrated,  on  either  the  north  or  south  side  of  the 
Aleutian  Islands  chain,  or  at  least  the  Aleuts  would  not  admit  to  knowing.  One  night,  as 
the  story  goes,  Russian  Navigator  Commander  Gavriil  Pribylov  supplied  an  Aleut  toion,2 
or  chief,  with  sufficient  liquor  to  loosen  the  toion’s  tongue.  The  Unimak  chief  told  Pribylov 
a  story  about  another  toion’s  son  who  became  caught  up  in  a  tempest  while  hunting  in 
his  baidarka  (kayak,  or  /qyax3).4  The  young  Unangan  hunter,  Igadagax ,5  was  carried  to 
the  shore  of  an  island—  Tanax  AmixT  (Aleut  for  “The  hand  Uncle”  or  “hand  of  Mother’s 
Brother”)7 — to  the  north,  where  he  found  the  breeding  grounds  of  laaqudax J8  (northern 
fur  seal). 

Pribylov  set  sail  in  June  1786,  and  soon  found  the  islands  that  now  bear  his  name.  His 
discovery  began  a  business  venture  that  would  last  nearly  200  years.  In  the  process,  sev¬ 
eral  abundant  marine  mammal  species  (sea  otter,  walrus,  and  sea  lion)  would  be  stripped 
of  an  ideal  refuge;  the  uninhabited  Seal  Islands  would  become  home  to  the  largest  Aleut 
community  during  the  twentieth  and  early  twenty-first  centuries;  and  the  Aleuts  of  this 
community  would  develop  a  new  cultural  identity.  Not  until  Russian  navigator  Gavriil 
Foginovich  Pribylov  brought  his  Russian  culture  and  alphabet  to  Tanax  Amix  did  docu¬ 
mentation  of  events,  names,  and  places  become  possible  for  that  land.  The  advent  of 
Russian  discovery  also  enabled  the  Unangan  to  begin  thinking  of  traditional  Tanax  Amix 
as  home. 

While  Russian  trading  companies  dominated  the  territory  and  promyshlenniki 
mastered  the  Aleuts,  the  Russian  Orthodox  Church  sought  to  provide  the  Natives  with 
spiritual  and  intellectual  well-being.  Church  officials,  led  by  Father  (later  Bishop)  Ivan 
Veniaminov,  not  only  developed  a  written  version  of  the  Aleuts’  oral  language  for  use  in 
spiritual  education,4  but  also  provided  the  first  comprehensive,  written  documentation  of 
Aleut  life,  culture,  and  environmental  setting.10 

During  this  early  period  the  Russian  imperial  government  continued  to  enlist  talent¬ 
ed  men,  similar  to  the  early  explorers  Bering  and  Steller,  to  lead  expeditions  and  gather 
information.  British,  French,  Spanish,  and  American  explorers  also  ventured  into  the  ter¬ 
ritory  claimed  by  Russians.  Many  of  these  men  set  down  their  observations,  often  with 
sketches  and  other  illustrations.  A  century  later,  English  translations  of  numerous  early 
writings  provided  Americans  with  colorful  documentation  of  the  early  history  of  what 
became  the  49th  state.  Unangan/Unangas  history  of  the  pre-European  contact  era  is  es¬ 
sentially  limited  to  the  writings  of  Veniaminov  and  a  few  others,  although  contemporary 
ethnologists  and  archaeologists  continue  to  bring  forth  new  perspectives.

Introduction 


Even  before  the  United  States  purchased  the  Territory  of  Alaska  from  Russia  in  1867, 
Americans  developed  an  interest  in  Alaska’s  natural  resources,  venturing  north  to  take 
whales,  sea  otters,  fur  seals,  fish,  and  ice,  as  well  as  to  survey  and  explore.  Some  of  these 
men  would  write  of  their  experiences  and  of  their  encounters  with  the  Aleuts.  By  the  time 
of  the  purchase,  however,  the  once  highly  profitable  whale  fishery  was  changing,  and  by 
1914  it  would  be  nearly  extinct.  The  only  sustainable  natural  resource  of  significant  value 
within  the  vast  territory  was  the  pelt  of  the  northern  fur  seal,  as  it  was  now  known,  which 
bred  almost  exclusively  on  the  Pribilof  Islands. 

Soon  after  the  United  States  took  ownership  of  Alaska,  fortune  hunters  set  sail  for 
the  Pribilofs.  They,  like  the  Russians,  used  the  islands’  indigenous  Aleuts  to  nearly  exter¬ 
minate  the  seal  herds,  despite  the  Aleuts’  protestations.  Fortunately,  the  U.S.  government 
recognized  the  long-term  economic  value  of  the  fur  seals  and  other  fur-bearing  mammals 
in  Alaska.  On  July  27,  1868,  Congress  passed  “An  act  to  extend  the  Laws  of  the  United 
States  relating  to  Customs,  Commerce,  and  Navigation  over  the  Territory  ceded  to  the 
United  States  by  Russia,  to  establish  a  Collection  District  therein,  and  for  other  Purposes.” 
Section  6  of  this  Act  provides  “That  it  shall  be  unlawful  for  any  person  or  persons  to  kill 
any  otter,  mink,  marten,  sable,  or  fur-seal,  or  other  fur-bearing  animal,  within  the  limits 
of  said  territory,  or  in  the  waters  thereof.  .  .”  (15  Stat.  240,  241).  Subsequently,  Congress 
passed  an  Act  on  March  3,  1869  providing  “That  the  islands  of  St.  Paul  and  St.  George, 
in  Alaska,  be,  and  they  are  hereby,  declared  a  special  reservation  for  government  pur¬ 
poses”  (15  Stat.  348)  intended  to  protect  fur-bearing  mammals  in  the  new  territory.11 
The  government  sent  the  military  to  protect  the  islands’  Native  inhabitants  and  to  keep 
unauthorized  persons  off  the  islands.  Revenue  agents  were  dispatched  in  1868  to  evaluate 
Native  living  conditions  and  the  vitality  of  the  seal  rookeries;  however,  delays  prevented 
them  from  arriving  until  1869.  The  agents  also  prevented  traders  from  shipping  sealskins 
taken  as  part  of  the  Natives’  subsistence  harvest,  until  duties  were  paid.  The  revenue 
agents  submitted  recommendations  on  how  the  U.S.  government  should  best  protect  and 
benefit  from  its  interests  on  the  islands.  The  government  chose  to  institute  an  industrial 
monopoly  on  the  islands  to  harvest  the  fur  seal  and  to  supply  the  federal  treasury  with  a 
sustainable  revenue  stream.  It  also  decreed  that  the  Aleuts  should  remain  as  the  harvest¬ 
ers  of  the  fur  seal  because  of  their  inherent  knowledge  and  skill,  thus  continuing  what  had 
become  their  traditional  vocation  under  the  Russians. 

Over  the  next  one  hundred-plus  years,  much  fact  and  fiction,  including  some  ro¬ 
mance,  would  be  written  about  the  valuable  fur  seal  industry,  the  businessmen  and  pi¬ 
rates  who  sought  the  wealth  derived  from  it,  and  others  who  aimed  to  control  the  wealth. 
The  U.S.  government  became  the  most  prolific  contributor  to  the  “headquarters  history.” 
U.S.  government  agents  of  the  Seal  Islands  justified  their  charge  through  daily  written 
documentation  and  reported  their  perspectives  on  the  health  and  welfare  of  the  Natives. 
Congressional  investigations  of  corruption  and  malfeasance,  allegations  of  mistreatment 
of  the  Aleuts,  and  international  claims  to  the  right  to  take  seals  filled  thousands  of  pages 
of  government  documents.  Government  scientists  eventually  played  a  significant  role  in 
the  management  of  the  seal  herds.  Science  and  scientists’  careers  do  not  advance  without 
a  written  record,  and  it  became  voluminous.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


In  the  Bering  Sea  from  approximately  1884  until  1911,  hunters  employing  the  prac¬ 
tice  known  as  pelagic  sealing,  or  the  killing  of  seals  in  the  open  sea,  waged  slaughter  on 
the  fur-seal  herd.  Men  from  Canada  and  America  used  canoes  launched  from  schooners 
to  hunt  seals  on  the  water,  a  practice  adopted  from  Northwest  American  Indians  such  as 
Pacheenahts,  Nuu-chah-nultas,  and  Clayoquots.  The  United  States  attempted  to  make 
the  practice  illegal  in  the  Bering  Sea  in  order  to  protect  its  interest  in  the  land  harvest. 

Many  of  the  pelagic  sealing  vessels  sailed  out  of  Canada,  although  California  and 
Washington  Territory  harbored  their  share.  The  Canadian  involvement  brought  its  sov¬ 
ereign,  Great  Britain,  into  the  political  fray.  In  an  attempt  to  resolve  the  dispute  between 
pelagic  sealers  and  the  U.S.  government,  an  International  Tribunal  of  Arbitration,  also 
referred  to  as  the  Fur-Seal  Arbitration,  was  convened  in  Paris,  France,  from  1892-93. 12 
Legal  preparations  for  the  case  resulted  in  innumerable  documents,  not  the  least  of  which 
was  the  sixteen-volume  U.S.  Senate,  Fur-Seal  Arbitration,  Proceedings  of  the  Tribunal  of 
Arbitration,  convened  at  Paris  under  the  Treaty  between  the  United  States  of  America  and 
Great  Britain,  concluded  at  Washington  February  29,  1892,  for  the  determination  of  ques¬ 
tions  between  the  two  governments  concerning  the  jurisdictional  rights  of  the  United  States 
in  the  waters  of  Bering  Sea,  published  in  1895  by  the  GPO. 

Newspapers  and  magazines  in  the  United  States,  Canada,  and  Great  Britain  fre¬ 
quently  reported  on  issues  related  to  the  case.  Unfortunately,  the  tribunal’s  award  (see 
text  box)  failed  to  settle  the  most  important  issue,  the  protection  of  the  fur  seal  from 
extinction.  The  seal  herd  continued  to  decline  because  of  both  the  pelagic  and  the  land 
harvests.  Further  scientific  investigations  were  launched  by  Great  Britain  and  the  United 
States  to  help  resolve  the  conflict  over  whether  the  principal  cause  of  the  seals’  decline 
was  pelagic  sealing  or  land  harvest.  Numerous  scientific  and  popular  writings,  congres¬ 
sional  hearings,  and  investigations  continued  for  a  few  years  after  the  signing  of  “The 
Convention  between  the  United  States  and  Other  Powers  Providing  for  the  Preservation 
and  Protection  of  Fur  Seals,”  popularly  known  as  the  “Fur-Seal  Treaty  of  1911,”  by  the 
United  States,  Great  Britain,  Russia,  and  Japan. 

From  1911  until  after  World  War  II  (WWII),  most  of  the  written  records  about  the 
Pribilof  Islands,  other  than  scientific  findings,  were  government  documents,  especial¬ 
ly  annual  reports  and  an  occasional  investigation  into  employee  malfeasance.  The  war 
brought  its  own  tragedy  to  the  people  of  the  Pribilof  and  Aleutian  islands.  More  stories 
would  be  written  about  that  period  than  any  other,  except  the  pelagic  sealing  era.  But 
events  of  WWII  also  shed  light  on  the  plight  of  the  Pribilof  Islands  Aleuts,  who,  with  the 
help  of  outsiders,  began  to  seek  full  entitlement  to  their  civil  rights,  including  the  right  to 
self-determination  that  the  federal  government  had  long  denied  them.  The  Aleuts’  strug¬ 
gle  progressed  slowly  between  1946  and  1963,  when  a  government  administrator  was 
brought  in  to  undertake  the  transition  from  federal  control  to  civil  administration  and 
private  land  ownership.  In  1983,  the  government  relinquished  all  of  its  responsibility  for 
administration  of  the  islands  and  management  of  the  fur-seal  industry,  excepting  the  seal 
and  bird  rookeries.  In  1984,  the  majority  of  federal  lands  were  transferred  to  Native  enti¬ 
ties  and  commercial  sealing  ended  when  the  U.S.  Senate  refused  to  ratify  an  extension  to 
the  1957  Interim  Convention  on  Conservation  of  North  Pacific  Fur  Seals.”13  Thereafter,

Introduction 


the  Marine  Mammal  Protection  Act  of  1972  (MMPA),  which  forbade  commercial  har¬ 
vests  of  marine  mammals,  took  precedence.  Struggling  to  develop  new  livelihoods,  the 
Aleut  people,  including  those  on  the  Seal  Islands,  turned  to  the  biologically  rich  Bering 
Sea  for  economic  diversification.  Offshore  petroleum  exploration  during  the  latter  twen¬ 
tieth  century  provided  some  potential  economic  relief,  but  that  effort  was  short-lived. 
The  Bering  Sea  fisheries,  the  most  productive  in  the  world,  offered  the  best  alternative. 
Federal  aid  and  investments  by  industrial  fish  processors  fueled  the  Seal  Islands’  future 
economy,  and  many  Aleuts  were  able  to  resume  an  ancestral  maritime-based  subsistence. 

Recorded  history  of  the  Pribilof  Islands  during  the  American  period  is  replete  with 
stories  of  individual  courage  and  fortitude  as  well  as  scandal  and  shame.  Told  through  the 
people  involved,  these  stories  are  among  the  many  colorful  threads  woven  into  the  fabric 
of  U.S.  and  Alaskan  history. 

The  biographical  portion  of  this  book  is  a  collection  of  sketches  of  remarkable  per¬ 
sons  now  deceased  who,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  played  a  part  in  the  history  of  the 
Pribilof  Islands.  The  only  exception  is  the  inclusion  of  centenarian  Victor  B.  Scheffer,  who 
at  the  time  of  this  writing  still  resides  in  Seattle.  Scheffer  helped  define  the  scientific  and 
management  history  of  the  fur-seal  herd.  The  focus  is  on  the  period  from  1867  (the  U.S. 
purchase)  to  1983,  when  administrative  control  and  most  land  ownership  on  the  two 
remote  islands  were  relinquished  to  the  resident  Aleuts. 

Many  of  the  people  included  in  this  book  never  set  foot  on  the  Pribilof  Islands 
but  were  significant  players  nonetheless.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Aleut  inhabitants  of 
the  Pribilof  Islands  (Unaagin)  rarely  left  written  records,  so  their  legacy  was  more  often 
chronicled  by  their  Russian  and  Anglo  contemporaries.  Consequently,  individual  Aleuts 
are  poorly  represented  among  the  biographies. 

The  biographies,  which  spotlight  more  than  200  individuals,  are  drawn  from  many 
sources  besides  standard  reference  works:  privately  published  books,  personal  diaries,  au¬ 
tobiographies  and  biographies,  letters,  firsthand  accounts  of  personal  experiences  noted 
in  official  reports,  newspaper  and  magazine  articles,  World  Wide  Web  sites,  and  the  ar¬ 
chives  of  assorted  institutions.  What  the  sources  reveal  are  always  interesting,  sometimes 
complex  and  intriguing,  and  often  adventurous  lives. 

Although  many  of  the  individuals  are  introduced  with  information  on  birth,  parent¬ 
age,  marriage,  offspring,  and  death,  the  genealogical  record  incorporated  herein  remains 
incomplete  for  many  and  entirely  wanting  for  some.  When  sufficient  details  allow,  a  bio¬ 
graphical  sketch  is  included  to  depict  the  individual’s  general  character  outside  of  the 
Pribilof  experience.  The  reader  may  occasionally  recognize  that  an  individual’s  behavior 
off  the  Pribilofs  either  accounts  for,  or  is  in  contradiction  to,  his  behavior  on  the  islands. 
The  general  biographical  sketch  is  often  followed  with  more  specific  Pribilof  Islands- 
related  experiences.  Excerpts  from  depositions  given  in  support  of  the  United  States  case 
before  the  International  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  from  1891  to  1893  are  included  when 
they  offer  insight  into  conditions  on  the  islands.  This  book  relies  heavily  upon  first-per¬ 
son  accounts.

AWARD 

of 

THE  TRIBUNAL  OF  ARBITRATION 
CONSTITUTED 

UNDER  THE  TREATY  CONCLUDED  AT  WASHINGTON, 

THE  29TH  OF  FEBRUARY,  1892 
BETWEEN 

THE  UNITED  STATES  OF  AMERICA 
AND  HER  MAJESTY  THE  QUEEN  OF  THE  UNITED  KINGDOM 
OF  GREAT  BRITAIN  AND  IRELAND* 

Article  1. 

The  Governments  of  the  United  States  and  of  Great  Britain  shall  forbid  their  citizens  and 
subjects  respectively  to  kill,  capture,  or  pursue,  at  any  time  and  in  any  manner  whatever, 
the  animals  commonly  called  fur  seals,  within  a  zone  of  sixty  miles  around  the  Pribilof 
Islands,  inclusive  of  the  territorial  waters. 

The  miles  mentioned  in  the  preceding  paragraph  are  geographical  miles  of  sixty  to  a  degree 
of  latitude. 

Article  2. 

The  two  Governments  shall  forbid  their  citizens  and  subjects  respectively  to  kill,  capture, 
or  pursue,  in  any  manner  whatever,  during  the  season  extending  each  year,  from  the  1st 
of  May  to  the  31st  of  July,  both  inclusive,  the  fur  seals  on  the  high  sea,  in  the  part  of  the 
Pacific  Ocean,  inclusive  of  the  Bering  Sea,  which  is  situated  to  the  north  of  the  35th  degree 
of  North  latitude,  and  eastward  of  the  180th  degree  of  longitude  from  Greenwich  till  it 
strikes  the  water  boundary  described  in  Article  1  of  the  Treaty  of  1867  between  the  United 
States  and  Russia,  and  following  that  line  up  to  Bering  Straits. 

Article  3. 

During  the  period  of  time  and  in  the  waters  in  which  the  fur  seal  fishing  is  allowed,  only 
sailing  vessels  shall  be  permitted  to  carry  on  or  take  part  in  fur-seal  fishing  operations. 

They  will,  however,  be  at  liberty  to  avail  themselves  of  the  use  of  such  canoes  or  undecked 
boats,  propelled  by  paddles,  oars,  or  sails,  as  are  in  common  use  as  fishing  boats. 

Article  4. 

Each  sailing  vessel  authorized  to  fish  for  fur  seals  must  be  provided  with  a  special  license 
issued  for  that  purpose  by  its  Government  and  shall  be  required  to  carry  a  distinguishing 
flag  to  be  prescribed  by  its  Government. 

Article  5. 

The  masters  of  the  vessels  engaged  in  fur  seal  fishing  shall  enter  accurately  in  their  official 
log  book  the  date  and  place  of  each  fur  seal  fishing  operation,  and  also  the  number  and  sex 
of  the  seals  captured  upon  each  day.  These  entries  shall  be  communicated  by  each  of  the 
two  Governments  to  the  other  at  the  end  of  each  fishing  season. 

Article  6. 

The  use  of  nets,  firearms,  and  explosives  shall  be  forbidden  in  the  fur  seal  fishing.  This 
lestriction  shall  not  apply  to  shotguns  when  such  fishing  takes  place  outside  of  Bering’s 
Sea,  during  the  season  when  it  may  be  lawfully  carried  on. 

Article  7. 

The  two  Governments  shall  take  measures  to  control  the  fitness  of  the  men  authorized  to 
en§age  in  fur  seal  fishing;  these  men  shall  have  been  proved  fit  to  handle  with  sufficient 
skill  the  weapons  by  means  of  which  this  fishing  may  be  carried  on.

Introduction 


Article  8. 

The  regulations  contained  in  the  preceding  articles  shall  not  apply  to  Indians  dwelling  on 
the  coasts  of  the  territory  of  the  United  States  or  of  Great  Britain  and  carrying  on  fur  seal 
fishing  in  canoes  or  undecked  boats  not  transported  by  or  used  in  connection  with  other 
vessels  and  propelled  wholly  by  paddles,  oars,  or  sails,  and  manned  by  Indians,  provided 
that,  when  so  hunting  in  canoes  or  undecked  boats,  they  shall  not  hunt  fur  seals  outside  of 
territorial  waters  under  contract  for  the  delivery  of  the  skins  to  any  person. 

This  exemption  shall  not  be  construed  to  affect  the  municipal  law  of  either  country,  nor 
shall  it  extend  to  the  waters  of  Bering  Sea  or  the  waters  of  the  Aleutian  Passes. 

Nothing  herein  contained  is  intended  to  interfere  with  the  employment  of  Indians  as 
hunters  or  otherwise  in  connection  with  fur  sealing  vessels  as  heretofore. 

Article  9. 

The  concurrent  regulations  hereby  determined  with  a  view  to  the  protection  and 
preservation  of  the  fur  seals  shall  remain  in  force  until  they  have  been,  in  whole  or  in  part, 
abolished  or  modified  by  common  agreement  between  the  Governments  of  the  United 
States  and  of  Great  Britain. 

The  said  concurrent  regulations  shall  be  submitted  every  five  years  to  a  new  examination, 
so  as  to  enable  both  interested  Governments  to  consider  whether,  in  the  light  of  past 
experience,  there  is  occasion  for  any  modification  thereof,  [portion  excluded  dealing  with 
liability  over  seized  vessels].

Washington  February  29,  1892,  for  the  determination  of  questions  between  the  two  governments

During  the  course  of  their  involvement  with  the  Pribilof  Islands,  the  authors  became 
acutely  aware  of  the  long-overdue  credit  owed  to  the  islands’  Aleut  population  for  its 
contribution  and  sacrifice  toward  the  protection  of  the  northern  fur  seal  and  the  genera¬ 
tion  of  significant  revenues  for  the  nation.  As  noted,  surviving  written  records  pertaining 
to  the  Pribilof  Islands’  Native  population— letters,  diaries,  log  books,  reports— were  pro¬ 
duced  mainly  by  non-Aleuts.  One  notable  exception  exists  in  the  depositions  mentioned 
above,  given  before  the  International  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  in  the  1890s.  Deponents 
included  Aleut  sealers,  who  occasionally  offered  Native  perspectives  of  life  on  the  Pribilof 
Islands. 

Throughout  the  biography,  the  terms  “agent,”  “assistant  agent,”  and  “special  agent” 
are  used  as  titles  for  the  U.S.  government  or  commercial  company  persons  with  authority 
over  the  management  and/or  administration  of  the  islands.  Over  time,  some  men  held 
more  than  one  title  as  they  rose  in  rank.  Occasionally,  in  the  Russian  and  early  American 
periods,  an  agent  was  referred  to  as  “governor.”  This  term  of  respect  was  merely  a  19th- 
century  colloquialism  for  “the  man  in  charge,”  not  the  equivalent  of  governor  of  the  state 
of  Alaska,  for  instance.  Women  never  became  agents,  although  many  worked  as  teachers 
or  nurses;  several  are  represented  herein.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


The  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  usually  at  the  direction  of  the  President  during  the 
1800s,  appointed  one  agent  and  typically  three  assistant  agents.  All  agents  took  oaths  to 
uphold  the  duties  of  their  assignment,  and  these  men  remained  in  service  until  relieved 
through  official  notification  from  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury.  Under  congressional 
orders,  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  also  sent  special  agents  and  assistant  special  agents 
on  short-term  assignments  to  gather  specific  information.  Special  agents  included  men 
such  as  Stephen  Buynitzky,  Charles  Bryant,  and  Hugh  McIntyre  in  1868,  Henry  W.  Elliott 
in  1890,  and  Joseph  Stanley-Brown  in  1892.  By  1913,  the  man  in  charge  held  the  title  of 
agent  and  caretaker.  Later  the  position  was  titled  superintendent. 

The  volume  begins  with  a  brief  history  of  Russian  Orthodox  churches  on  the  Seal 
Islands,  and  genealogies  and  biographical  sketches  of  the  clergymen  who  served  the 
Pribilof  Islands’  Native  communities.  The  post-cession  administration  on  the  Pribilof 
Islands  began  with  agent  Alexander  Milovidov  representing  Hutchinson,  Kohl  & 
Company,  and  two  of  the  first  U.S.  government  agents/assistant  agents,  Charles  Bryant 
and  Samuel  Falconer.14  The  expanded  biographical  sketches  and  genealogies  of  these 
three  men  follow  those  of  the  clergymen.  Subsequently,  the  stories  of  other  individuals 
who  lived  on,  worked  on,  or  otherwise  influenced  Pribilof  Islands  history  are  presented 
alphabetically.

5  The  Aleut  name  Igadagax  is  spelled  variously  in  the  literature.  As  used  herein,  the  name  is  as  given 
by  Knut  Bergsland,  Ancient  Aleut  Personal  Names,  200.  Waldemar  Jochelson,  Aleut  Tales  and 
Narratives,  Collected  in  1909-1910,  used  the  name  Iggadaagix.  See  Igadagax  biography  in  this 
volume. 

6  Veniaminov,  Notes  on  the  Islands,  134,  states  that  the  islands  discovered  by  Igadagax  were  called 
Amix.  The  origin  of  the  name  Tanax-Amix  is  uncertain.  Henry  W.  Elliott  in  The  Seal-Islands 

of  Alaska  (Kingston,  ON:  Limestone  Press,  1976  reprint  of  1881  edition),  146,  who  translated 
Veniaminov ’s  work,  spelled  the  islands’  name  “Ateek.” 

/  Veniaminov  wrote  the  first  full  account  of  the  legend  of  Igadagax.  No  archaeological  or  written 
evidence  is  known  to  exist  demonstrating  that  any  Unangan  inhabited  Tanax-Amix.  The  story  of 
Tanax-Amix  lives  through  a  fragment  of  oral  history  or  “memory  culture.”  The  value  of  memory 
culture  is  described  in  Margaret  Lantis  and  Robert  E.  Ackerman,  eds.,  Ethnohistory  in  Southwest

(Fairbanks:  Alaska  Native  Language  Center,  University  of  Alaska,  1994)  for  greater  detail  on  the  his¬ 
tory  of  linguistics  of  the  Aleut  language. 

1 1  There  is  a  good  discussion  of  this  topic  in  the  descriptive  pamphlet  for  National  Archives  microfilm 
publication  M720,  Alaska  File  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  (Washington,  DC:  National  Archives 
and  Records  Administration,  1968),  1. 

12  Solicitor  Edwin  W.  Sims,  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  and  Labor,  states,  “This  tribunal  which 
concluded  its  labors  in  Paris  in  1893,  is  usually  spoken  of  as  ‘The  Paris  Tribunal  of  Arbitration,’  and 
its  findings  and  award  as  ‘The  Award  of  the  Paris  Tribunal.’”  Edwin  W.  Sims,  Report  on  the  Alaskan 
Fur-Sea  Fisheries  (Washington,  DC:  GPO,  1906),  9.  We  have  decided  to  retain  the  phrases  “Tribunal 
of  Arbitration”  and  “Award  of  the  Tribunal.” 

13  “The  Interim  Convention  on  Conservation  of  North  Pacific  Fur  Seals”  was  the  international  agree¬ 
ment  under  which  the  fur  seal  had  been  harvested  commercially  since  1957,  and  the  skins  were  allo¬ 
cated  among  the  signing  nations.  The  convention  was  signed  by  Japan,  Canada,  the  Union  of  Soviet 
Socialist  Republics,  and  the  United  States.  The  convention  evolved  from  a  series  of  treaties  dating 
back  to  1891  beginning  with  the  Modus  Vivendi  which  placed  a  temporary  hold  on  pelagic  and  land 
killing  of  fur  seals  except  by  those  Natives  relying  upon  the  fur  seal  for  subsistence.  The  Modus  was 
followed  by  a  treaty  signed  on  Feb.  29,  1892,  between  Great  Britain  and  the  United  States;  see  also 
Victor  B.  Scheffer,  Clifford  H.  Fiscus,  and  Ethel  I.  Todd,  Flistory  of  Scientific  Study  and  Management 
of  the  Alaskan  Fur  Seal,  Callorhinus  ursinus,  1786-1964,  NOAA  Tech.  Rep.  NMFS  SSRF-780 
(Washington,  DC:  GPO,  1984),  10).  Two  decades  subsequently,  the  “Fur-Seal  Treaty  of  1911”  was 
concluded  among  the  United  States,  Russia,  Japan,  and  Great  Britain  on  behalf  of  Canada.  Japan 
withdrew  from  the  convention  during  Oct.  1941.  Not  until  1955  did  the  four  signatory  nations 
reconvene  to  renegotiate  a  treaty.  The  result  became  “The  Interim  Convention  on  Conservation  of 
North  Pacific  Fur  Seals  of  1957.”  The  convention  ended  in  1983,  when  the  U.S.  Senate  failed  to  ratify 
it.  At  that  time,  the  Marine  Mammal  Protection  Act  of  1972  dictated  the  handling  and  management 
of  the  northern  fur  seal. 

14  Hugh  H.  McIntyre  and  Charles  Bryant  were  the  first  two  special  agents  assigned  to  the  Pribilof 
Islands  by  the  Treasury  Department,  during  1868-9.  However,  McIntyre  did  not  spend  a  consider¬ 
able  amount  of  time  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  performance  of  that  duty,  as  his  duty  required  him  to 
travel  throughout  greater  Alaska.  In  1870,  McIntyre  worked  for  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company, 
the  government’s  first  lessee  to  harvest  the  fur  seals.  Therefore,  McIntyre’s  biography  is  presented 
among  the  larger  body  of  biographies.

The  First  Three  Managers 


Alexander  Milovidov,  Captain  Charles  Bryant,  and  Samuel  Falconer  represent 
the  outgoing  and  incoming  administrations  of  the  Russian-American  Company  and  the 
United  States  government,  respectively,  on  the  Pribilof  Islands,  Alaska,  following  the  ces¬ 
sion  of  Russian  America  in  1867.  During  the  1867-1870  interregnum,  the  administration 
of  the  Seal  Islands  was  chaotic  and  nearly  lawless.  The  Department  of  War  had  respon¬ 
sibility  for  maintaining  order  and  the  welfare  of  the  Natives  on  the  islands.  The  Treasury 
Department  was  to  protect  the  government’s  fur-seal  assets  and  ensure  the  collection  of 
appropriate  taxes.  Former  Russian-American  Company  Manager  Alexander  Milovidov, 
living  on  St.  Paul  Island,  brought  some  stability  during  the  transition  period.  The  U.S. 
Army  detailed  soldiers  to  the  islands  to  maintain  peace,  but  the  records  reviewed  by  the 
authors  did  not  indicate  that  any  of  these  military  men  were  exceptional  individuals.  In 
1868-69,  the  Treasury  sent  Captain  Charles  Bryant  and  Hugh  McIntyre  to  collect  infor¬ 
mation  and  give  advice  on  how  best  to  protect  the  nation’s  revenue-bearing  interests  in 
Alaska,  including  its  fur-seal  assets.  McIntyre  spent  little  time  on  the  Pribilof  Islands, 
as  he  also  traveled  about  the  Territory  of  Alaska  to  attend  to  similar  duties.  In  1870, 
the  Treasury  Department  was  directed  to  administer  the  Pribilof  Islands,  and  the  War 
Department  was  withdrawn.  The  Treasury  sent  Agent  Charles  Bryant,  who  previously 
served  as  a  revenue  agent,  to  reside  on  St.  Paul  Island  to  represent  the  nation’s  admin¬ 
istrative  interests.  Samuel  Falconer  was  selected  to  be  Bryant’s  assistant  agent,  residing 
on  St.  George  Island.  During  that  time  the  Treasury  also  awarded  a  lease  to  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company  to  manage  the  fur-seal  harvest  and  to  look  after  the  welfare  of  the 
Aleuts  on  the  islands.

Genealogy2 

Alexander  Milovidov,  the  son  of  Alfei  Gavrilov  Milovidov  (1789-1840)  and  Nadezhda 
Ulitovskii  Milovidov,3  was  born  August  21,  1821,  in  Sitka,  Alaska.  Alfei  Gavrilov 
Milovidov,  a  Russian-American  Company  employee,  had  emigrated  from  Moscow  to 
Russian  America  in  1815.4 

Alexander  married  Alexandra  Mikailova  Kaminskii.  Alexandra  was  born  at  Fort  Ross, 
California,  in  1838.  She  was  the  daughter  of  Mikhail  Ivanov  Kaminskii  (Kamenskii)  and 
an  unnamed  woman  he  married  at  the  Ross  Colony.  Fort  Ross  records  state  that  Mikhail 
Kaminskii’s  wife  was  an  Indian;  however,  the  Russian-American  Company  populated 
their  Fort  Ross  colony  with  Aleuts,  Alutiiqs,  and  Kenaitze  (Athabascans),  although  other 
Native  Americans  may  have  lived  there.  All  Native  Americans  residing  at  Ft.  Ross  were 
identified  with  the  “Indian”  descriptor.5  Alexander  Milovidov  died  on  St.  Paul  Island, 
Alaska,  on  October  5,  1870. 

Alexandra’s  father,  Mikhail  Kaminskii  (Kamenskii),  a  burgher  of  St.  Petersburg, 
Russia,  had  a  vocation  as  a  prikashchik  (Russian:  administrator  or  manager)  at  the  Ross

was  sent  to  Novo-Arkhangel’sk  (Sitka).6 

Alexandra  Milovidov  had  a  brother  named  Grigorii  Kamenskii.  Alexandra’s  death 
was  described  by  the  St.  Paul  Island  Agent  in  his  log: 

Alexandra  Milovidov  died  Monday,  August  19,  1895,  on  St.  Paul  Island,  at  the  residence

and  her  death  was  not  unexpected.  Simeon  Melovidov  local  school  teacher  and  son  of  the 
above  requested  that  school  be  dismissed  until  the  burial  of  his  mother  which  request  was 
granted.7 

Wednesday,  Aug.  21,  1895.  The  funeral  of  Mrs.  Alexandra  Melovidov  who  died  last  Monday 
took  place  at  2  p.m.  this  afternoon  from  her  late  residence  and  was  largely  attended.8

Biographical  Sketch 

At  some  time  between  1859  and  1861,  Russian-American  Company  Governor  Iogan 
Khaltusovich  (Ivan  Vasilevich)  Furuhjelm  (1859-63)  ordered  Alexander  Milovidov,  a 
Creole,  to  replace  Ivan  Repin  as  manager  of  the  Seal  Islands.  Repin’s  brutal  behavior  had 
demoralized  the  Aleut  workforce  and  inhibited  their  productivity.  Milovidov  arrived  in 
the  spring  of  1861.  His  Russian  superiors  strongly  impressed  upon  Milovidov  that  he 
should  strive  to  follow  in  the  footsteps  of  former  Manager  Kass'ian  Shaiashnikov,10  who 
had  died  not  long  before  (circa  1860).  Shaiashnikov  was  hailed  as  a  genius  and  a  saint, 
and  Milovidov  was  exhorted  to  perform  his  duties  as  sensibly,  efficiently,  faithfully  and 
accurately  as  Shaiashnikov  had  done.  He  was  advised  to  live  so  righteously  that  his  sub¬ 
ordinates  would  obey  him  out  of  respect  and  love,  as  they  had  followed  Shaiashnikov ’s 
leadership.  Corporal  punishment  was  forbidden;  after  Repin,  no  manager  had  power  as 
judge,  and  all  offenders  faced  trial  by  naval  officers  commanding  the  annual  supply  ship. 

Milovidov  inherited  many  pressing  duties  neglected  by  Repin.  Most  urgent  among 
them  included  responding  to  grievances  levied  by  Native  sealers  from  Kodiak  and  the 
Aleutians  demanding  to  leave  the  Seal  Islands  and  return  to  their  homes.  Milovidov  “was 
to  remind  these  petitioners  that  life  everywhere  was  hard  but  easiest  on  the  Seal  Islands 
where  provisions  were  plentiful  and  wages  the  highest  in  the  colony.”11

The  First  Three  Managers  ♦  Milovidov 


Although  reprimanded  in  1864  for  filling  only  half  an  order  for  20,000  dry  skins,  a 
failure  probably  due  to  the  weather,  Milovidov’s  comportment  pleased  his  superiors  and 
in  1866  they  paid  him  a  bonus  of  500  rubles.12 

In  1868,  the  year  after  the  U.S.  purchase  of  Alaska,  Hayward  Hutchinson  of 
Hutchinson,  Kohl,  &  Company,  arranged  for  a  census  of  the  St.  Paul  Island  Native  com¬ 
munity.13  In  the  census,  Alexander  Milovidov  and  his  family  are  at  the  head  of  the  list 
and  listed  as  Creoles.  The  United  States  government  conducted  its  first  census  in  St.  Paul 
Island  on  July  1,  1870.  Although  Alexander  Milovidov  didn’t  die  until  October  1870,  his 
wife  Alexandra  is  listed  as  a  widow  in  the  July  1870  census.14  Following  Alexander’s  death, 
his  eldest  son,  Anton,  became  the  head  of  the  household. 

The  former  head  of  the  family  Alexander  Melovedoff  (deceased),  was  a  Russian  Creole 
residing  on  the  Island  as  Storekeeper  for  the  Russian  American  Fur  Company  at  the  time 
of  the  transfer  of  the  Territory  to  the  United  States  and  removed  to  Sitka  in  1867,  where  he 
subsequently  became  an  American  Citizen  under  the  Treaty  of  Transfer,  having  complied 
with  the  conditions  prescribed  by  said  Treaty,  after  which  he  returned  to  this  Island  again 
as  storekeeper  for  the  Hutchinson  Kohl  &  Co.  in  the  spring  of  1868,  and  died  very  suddenly 
in  October  1870,  his  family  remaining  on  the  island  since.  A  daughter  of  his  named 
Alexandra  married  Henry  W.  Elliott,  Assistant  Treasury  Agent  in  July  1872. 15 

The  next  island  census  taken  by  the  government  was  dated  January  1,  1873.  The  fol¬ 
lowing  was  reported  in  the  Agent’s  Log  for  the  Milovidov  family: 

The  names  are  written  so  as  to  give  the  sound  as  they  are  pronounced  in  Russian. 

Anton  Meeloveedoff  born  1857  in  Kodiak,  18  years  old 
Alexandra,  his  mother,  born  California,  38  yrs  old 
Simeon,  his  brother,  born  Sitka,  6  years  old 
Marcia,  his  sister,  born  St.  Paul,  8  years  old 
Solomayah,  adopted  in  the  family,  16  years  old16 

Alexander  Milovidov’s  life  story,  although  brief,  was  one  of  opportunity  and  in¬ 
trigue  at  the  time  of  transition  from  Russian  to  American  sovereignty.  Opportunity  came 
through  his  involvement  with  Captain  Gustave  Nybom  (see  Nybom’s  biography)  and  the 
newly  formed  Hansen,  Nybom,  &  Co.  following  the  demise  of  his  employer,  the  Russian- 
American  Company.  Some  intrigue  between  Nybom  and  the  Milovidov  family  was  evi¬ 
dent  in  a  1922  letter  from  Henry  Elliott  to  his  oldest  daughter,  Grace,  whom  Elliott  af¬ 
fectionately  called  “Appy.”  In  the  letter,  Elliott  relayed  his  knowledge  of  the  family  story 
involving  Grace’s  grandfather  Alexander  Milovidov  and  Gustave  Niebaum  (Nybom). 

Dear  Appy:  You  ask  about  that  debt  of  Capt  Niebaum  to  Mother’s  father.  The  exact  status 
of  it,  I  never  could  get  from  anyone;  but  this  much  came  to  me  quite  direct.  When  Alaska 
was  transferred  Oct.  1867,  to  the  possession  of  the  U.S.A.,  Capt.  Niebaum  was  in  command 
of  a  small  vessel  belonging  to  the  Russian  American  Company  which  was  busy  supplying 
the  Seal  Islands  with  store  and  supplies  from  the  Sitka  depot  and  bringing  the  salted  seal 
skins  down  from  the  islands  to  Sitka.  When  the  Russian  American  Co.  at  Sitka  sold  all  of 
its  outfit  to  Hutchinson,  Kohl  &  Co.  of  San  Francisco  Oct.  1867,  it  covered  some  67,000  salt 
[sic]  seal  skins  then  in  the  warehouse  on  St.  Paul’s  Island. 

It  seems,  however,  that  Mother’s  father,  who  was  the  “Governor”  and  Russian  agent  in 
charge  of  the  islands,  took  some  70,000  seal  skins  during  the  summer  of  1867,  which 
were  not  listed  in  this  Sitkan  inventory  or  bill  of  sale  to  Hutchinson  Kohl  and  Co.  Captain 
Niebaum  with  Melividov’s  consent  put  these  skins  into  his  vessel,  and  had  them  under 


15 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


hatches  before  Hutchinson,  Kohl  Co.’s  steamer,  the  Fideliter,  arrived  at  the  islands,  and 
took  the  67,000  salt  skins  which  had  been  taken  in  1866  and  were  lying  in  the  salt  houses 
on  the  islands.  The  Fideliter  arrived  later  in  March  1868,  she  took  the  67,000  skins  aboard 
and  learned  of  the  other  70,000  which  had  been  taken  on  board  of  Niebaum’s  vessel.  An 
understanding  was  made  then  between  Niebaum,  Melividov  and  Hutchinson,  Kohl.  &  Co., 
whereby  Niebaum  and  Melividov  were  to  have  half  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  those  70,000 
skins  (they  were  then  worth  about  $3.00  per  skin). 

Mother’s  father,  Melividov  died  a  few  weeks  after  this  deal  was  made17  and  Captain 
Niebaum  was  the  only  witness  or  surviving  partner  to  that  deal.  I  never  could  find  out  the 
details.  Mrs.  Melividov  (Mother's  mother),  never  got  more  than  $5,000  or  $6,000  from 
Hutchinson  Kohl  &  Co.  She  ought  to  have  received  at  least  $40,000  and  would  have  done 
so  if  Melividov  had  not  suddenly  died  just  as  that  deal  was  made. 

I  did  not  know  anything  about  this  Niebaum-Melividov  deal  until  long  after  I  married 
Mother.  I  incidentally  learned  of  it  from  Capt.  Niebaum’s  partners  Sloss  and  Capt.  Kohl  in 
the  Alaska  Commercial  Co.  along  as  late  as  1881  or  1882.  Then,  in  1890, 1  asked  Dr.  H.  H. 
McIntyre  about  it  when  I  met  him  here.  He  told  me  substantially  what  I  have  stated  at  the 
opening  of  this  subject  above.  I  am  satisfied  that  Mrs.  Melividov  never  got  what  was  really 
coming  to  her  and  of  course  there  are  no  records  which  would  enable  any  one  to  get  it  for 
her  or  her  heirs.18

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Anton  Milovidov  emulated  his  father  as  an  intel¬ 
ligent  and  demonstrated  leader.  As  an  employee 
of  the  North  American  Commercial  Company,  he 
deposed  for  the  Fur-Seal  Arbitration,  which  con¬ 
vened  to  settle  an  international  controversy  over 
the  rights  to  and  manner  of  harvesting  fur  seals. 
Excerpts  from  his  deposition  offer  a  glimpse  into 
his  life  on  St.  Paul  Island. 

I  [Anton  Melovedoff]  am  38  years  of  age  and  I 
was  born  on  Kodiak  Island,  Alaska.  I  came  to  St. 
Paul  Island  in  1864,  the  first  time,  and  in  1869  the 
second  time.  I  have  resided  here  since  1869  and  I 
have  been  constantly  employed  among  the  Alaskan 
fur-seals  in  all  that  time.  I  have  had  a  large  and 
varied  experience  in  all  the  details  of  the  business 
as  it  has  been  carried  out  on  St.  Paul  Island,  and  I 
have  done  service  in  all  the  departments  from  the 
work  of  a  boy  to  that  of  First  Chief  of  the  Island. 

I  can  read  and  write  the  English,  Russian,  and 
Aleut  languages  and  I  can  interpret  them  into  one 
another.  I  have  read  a  considerable  amount  of  the 
controversies  on  the  Seal  Question. ...  I  became 
First  Chief  in  1884,  which  office  I  resigned  in  1891.

In  the  Russian  times,  before  1868,  the  seals  were  always  driven  across  the  Island  of  St.  Paul 
from  North  East  Point  to  the  village  salt  house— a  distance  of  12  1/2  miles— but  when  the 
Alaska  Commercial  Company  leased  the  islands  they  stopped  long  driving  and  built  salt 
houses  near  to  the  hauling  grounds,  so  that  by  1879  no  seals  were  driven  more  than  2  miles.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


The  killing  of  females  [fur  seal]  is  a  crime  on  St.  Paul  Island,  and  our  Church  teaches  that  it 
is  a  sin  to  kill  one,  and  our  people  know  that  the  death  of  a  cow  seal  means  one  pup  less  for 
meat  in  years  to  come.24 

As  Anton  Milovidov  stated  in  his  deposition,  he  became  first  chief  in  1884;  he  lost 
his  position  on  September  16,  1885,  but  regained  it  on  June  10,  1887.25  He  again  lost  the 
first  chief’s  position  in  1891  because,  as  he  stated  in  his  deposition  for  the  International 
Tribunal  of  Arbitration,  he  was  “working  in  the  interests  of  the  Company  rather  than  that 
of  the  Government.”26

Biographical  Sketch 

Simeon  Alexander  Milovidov  received  his  teacher  training  at  Oakmont  College,  San 
Francisco,  California.34 

In  1888,  at  the  age  of  twenty-one,  Simeon  A.  Milovidov  testified  before  the  House 
Committee  on  Merchant  Marine  and  Fisheries  during  its  investigation  of  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company.35  He  said  that  he  had  been  born  at  Sitka  and  moved  to  St.  Paul 
Island  at  three  months  of  age.  He  began  his  island  education  at  the  age  of  five  and  con¬ 
tinued  until  age  fifteen,  learning  arithmetic  and  how  to  read  and  write  English  at  the  St. 
Paul  school.  During  his  early  adulthood,  the  government  monitored  Simeon  Alexander 
Milovidov  s  travels  and  role  as  an  island  school  teacher.  The  following  notations  regarding 
Simeon’s  travels  are  based  on  comments  in  the  St.  Paul  Island  Agents’  Logs  and  respective 
agents’  annual  reports. 

August  4,  1886:  departed  for  college  at  age  19. 

May  31,  1887:  returned  from  school  at  Napa  [California].36 

August  18,  1888:  departed  for  the  winter  on  steamer  St.  Paul  to  attend 
school  in  San  Francisco. 

June  1,  1889:  returned  on  steamer  St.  Paul  from  San  Francisco. 

September  2,  1889:  began  teaching  on  St.  Paul  Island. 

July  21,  1889:  Anton  &  Simeon  buy  instruments  for  St.  Paul  Island  band. 

August  10,  1890:  embarked  for  San  Francisco  on  the  Arago. 

June  25,  1891:  Simeon  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska,  with  his  wife  on 
steamer  St.  Paul. 

September  2,  1891-April  28,  1911:  Simeon  served  as  the  school  teacher  on 
St.  Paul  Island. 

December  3,  1891  (Agent  Williams’  annual  report37):  “Mr.  Simeon 

Melivedoff  [sic],  a  native  sealer  has  been  placed  in  charge  of  the  schools 
on  St.  Paul  Island  by  the  lessees.  His  compensation,  I  understand,  has 
been  fixed  at  $50  per  month.” 

January  1,  1892:  Simeon  Melovidov,  the  teacher,  made  his  school  report 
today  for  the  months  of  September,  October,  November  and  December, 
showing  an  attendance  of  50  pupils;  boys  20  and  girls  30,  total  50. 

Average  attendance  99  percent.  Branches  taught— Spelling,  Reading, 

Writing,  Geography  and  Arithmetic.38 

Simeon  Alexander  Milovidov’s  son,  Alexander  Simeon  [5c],  left  St.  Paul  Island  on  June 
29,  1911,  to  attend  the  Chemawa  Indian  School  at  Salem,  Oregon.39  Then  on  August  25, 
1911,  Simeon  Alexander  Milovidov  [5]  and  the  rest  of  the  family  (wife  Alexandra,  daugh¬ 
ter  Margaret,  sons  Frank  and  Simeon  Jr.,  and  Marcia,  daughter  of  his  brother  Anton  who 
died  in  1896)  departed  St.  Paul  Island  aboard  the  vessel  Homer  bound  for  San  Francisco.

The  First  Three  Managers  ♦  Milovidov 


The  pending  event  and  the  departure  were  noted  in  the 
St.  Paul  Agent’s  Log. 

Mr.  Simeon  Melovidof,  the  school  teacher  here  for  many 
years,  will  remove  with  his  family  to  the  States  for  the 
purpose  of  putting  his  children  into  school  and  otherwise 
providing  for  their  future.40 

Simeon  Alexander  Milovidov  began  teaching  at  St. 

Paul  Island  during  the  fall  of  1889,  and  continued  to 
serve  the  community  until  1911.  Other  than  what  the 
agent  reported  as  shown  above,  we  are  curious  as  to 
why  the  Milovidov  family  chose  to  leave  the  Pribilofs 
in  1911.  The  family’s  youngest  child,  Simeon  Jr.,  was 
thirteen  years  old  at  the  time  of  their  move,  and  an 
eighth  grade  education  was  the  norm  for  the  time  on 
the  Pribilofs  and  in  America.  Also,  the  government 
provided  lodging  and  most  of  the  food,  and  the  elder 
Simeon’s  salary  was  $1,200  per  annum,  which  was  the  same  as  the  island’s  physician,  H. 
C.  Mills.41  We  conclude  that  Simeon  had  saved  a  considerable  sum  of  money,  as  many 
of  the  islands’  Aleut  workers  had,42  and  may  have  been  drawn  to  California  where  his 
mother  had  been  born,  and  where  his  sister,  Alexandra  Elliott,  age  seventy,  was  living  in 
Pleasanton  with  her  daughter  Grace  Elliott,  age  fifty.  He  may  also  have  been  lured  to  a 
nearby  vineyard  developed  by  his  former  Alaska  Commercial  Company  bosses  Gustave 
Niebaum  and  Hamden  McIntyre,  both  of  whom  had  worked  at  St.  Paul  Island. 

The  1920  U.S.  Census  placed  the  family  in  Sonoma,  California,  where  Simeon,  then 
fifty-two,  owned  a  poultry  farm  located  at  I  Street  Extension.  Simeon  Jr.  married  Nancy 
Elizabeth  James,  and  the  couple  resided  at  the  home  of  Simeon  Sr.  along  with  Simeon  Jr.’s

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Simeon  Alexander  Milovidov,  as  had  his  brother  Anton,  deposed  for  the  International 
Tribunal  of  Arbitration.  Simeon  Alexander’s  deposition  provides  some  autobiographical 
material. 

I  am  twenty  five  years  of  age,  and  I  was  born  at  Sitka,  Alaska.  I  came  to  St.  Paul  Island  in 
1867  and  resided  here  ever  since.  I  have  a  practical  knowledge  of  and  am  familiar  with 
the  fur-seal  industry  as  it  is  carried  out  on  St.  Paul  Island.  I  became  an  able  sealer  in  1879, 
and  worked  at  it  ever  since,  except  in  the  winters,  when  I  was  at  school.  I  have  driven  seals 
and  skinned  them  and  prepared  the  skins  for  shipment.  I  am  at  present  the  school  teacher 
on  St.  Paul  Island,  and  I  can  read  and  write  English  and  Russian,  as  well  as  the  Aleut 
language.43

Genealogy 

Alexander  Simeon  Milovidov  met  Nancy  Elizabeth  James  in  England  during  World 
War  I  while  in  the  U.S.  Navy.  Nancy  immigrated  to  the  United  States  after  the  war,  and 
they  married  at  Lawrence,  Kansas.44 

Two  children  were  born  to  the  union  of  Alexander  Simeon  and  Nancy  James: 
Alexander  “Alex”  Steele  and  Margaret  “Margarie”  Irene. 

Biographical  Sketch 

Alexander  Simeon’s  love  of  music  was  developed  at  an  early  age  with  his  family’s  en¬ 
couragement.  In  1889,  his  father  Simeon  Alexander  [5]  and  his  Uncle  Anton  Milovidov 
[3]  had  bought  violins  and  played  in  the  St.  Paul  Island  Band.  Alexander  Simeon  started 
his  musical  career  while  attending  the  Chemawa  Indian  School  at  Salem,  Oregon.  He 
graduated  from  Chemawa  circa  1915.  Alexander  Simeon  Milovidov  became  second  vio¬ 
linist  with  the  Indian  String  Quartet  and  toured  during  1917  with  the  Chautauqua  lec¬ 
turer  Richard  H.  Kennedy.45 

The  1920  U.S.  Census  recorded  Alexander  Simeon  living  in  Kansas  City,  Missouri. 
He  worked  as  a  printer  (a  printer’s  apprentice,  according  to  his  son  Alexander  Steele 
[5ci] )  at  a  publishing  company.  As  a  professional  musician,  he  performed  in  the  Orpheum 
Circuit,  in  vaudeville,  and  in  Hollywood  movies.  His  music  experience  became  a  step- 
pingstone  for  his  life’s  later  work  as  a  teacher.  He  taught  music  at  the  Haskell  Institute  in 
Lawrence,  Kansas,46  in  Oregon,  and  finally  in  Tacoma,  Washington,47  where  he  became 
well  known  as  the  high  school  music  teacher  and  band  leader.  He  developed  a  junior  sym¬ 
phony  orchestra  and  taught  all  orchestra  and  band  instruments  including  the  Hawaiian 
and  Spanish  guitar.48 

Alexander  Simeon’s  son,  Alex  Steele  Melovidoff,  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Army  Air  Corps 
in  December  1943.  He  received  his  initial  training  at  Iowa  State  Teacher’s  College,  Cedar

Falls,  Iowa,  then  went  for  primary  flight  training  at  Oxnard,  California,  and  finished  his 
training  at  Stockton,  California.  He  was  assigned  to  the  Las  Vegas  Army  Airfield  to  fly 
B-17  s  and  later  B-24’s.  In  November  1944,  Alex  was  shot  down  in  Austria.  The  Germans 
held  him  as  a  prisoner  of  war  until  May  of  1945.49 


Alexander  Simeon  Melovidoff  was  the  founder  and  president  of  the  Tacoma  Conservatory  of  Music. 
For  many  years  he  conducted  a  summer  band  concert  series  at  Point  Defiance  Park.  Mr.  Melovidoff  is 
depicted  in  the  photograph  with  “his  All-Tacoma  Band  as  they  appeared  in  1947.  Their  first  concert  in 
the  park  that  year  was  on  June  29th.  They  played  15  numbers!’  (“Tacoma  Band  Starts  Concert  Season

Genealogy 

Charles  Bryant,  the  son  of  William  Bryant  and  Mary  (Johnson)  Bryant,  was  born  May 
9,  1820,  in  Rochester,  Plymouth  County,  Massachusetts.  In  1851,  midway  through  the 
twenty-one  years  he  spent  at  sea  as  a  whaler,  Charles  Bryant  married  Hannah  Eldridge 
(1822-1892),  the  daughter  of  Peleg  Eldridge  and  Hannah  (Briggs)  Eldridge  of  Taunton, 
Massachusetts.  Charles  and  Hannah  Bryant  had  no  children  of  their  own,  but  raised  their 
niece  Janetta  Pierce,  daughter  of  Josiah  Pierce  and  Hannah  (Bryant)  Pierce.50  Captain 
Charles  Bryant  died  on  July  2, 1903,  aged  83.  Charles  Bryant  is  buried  in  the  Bryant  family 
plot  in  the  Sherman  Cemetery  at  Rochester,  Massachusetts.51

Biographical  Sketch 

Captain  Charles  Bryant  testified  in  Washington,  D.C.,  on  March  20,  1876,  before  the 
Committee  of  Ways  and  Means  of  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives.  The  committee 
had  directed  an  investigation  into  matters  relating  to  the  lease  granted  to  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company  for  the  right  to  kill  fur  seals  on  the  Pribilof  Islands. 

My  name  is  Charles  Bryant:  my  occupation  at  the  time  of  my  appointment  was  farming, 
but  the  principal  occupation  of  my  life-time  has  been  catching  whales;  my  place  of 
residence  was  Fairhaven,  Mass. ...  I  went  first  [to  the  Pribilofs]  in  April  of  1869  and 
remained  until  September  as  Treasury  agent  of  the  Government. ...  In  the  summer  of 
1870, 1  went  out  as  special  agent  to  relieve  the  necessities  of  the  natives  and  take  care  of 
them.  In  consequence  of  all  trade  being  interdicted  there,  and  their  not  being  allowed  to 
kill  seals,  they  were  in  a  condition  of  great  want  and  necessity.  I  was  sent  by  the  Secretary 
of  the  Treasury,  on  the  steamer  Lincoln,  to  supply  their  wants  and  necessities  until  such 
time  as  Congress  took  action.  At  the  time  I  left,  Congress  had  taken  no  action  in  regard  to 
the  leasing  of  the  islands. 

(Q) . . .  Suppose  any  of  the  natives  should  want  to  leave  the  islands,  are  they  kept  there 
against  their  will?  (A)  No,  sir;  they  are  always  at  liberty  to  leave;  that  is  a  standing  rule.52 

Charles  Bryant  first  went  to  sea  in  1840  as  a  twenty-year-old  seaman  on  the  Montezuma. 
From  1844  to  1847  he  served  as  a  seaman  on  the  Champion  and  from  1848  to  1850  as 
third  mate  on  the  Abraham  Barker.  He  was  second  mate  on  the  Gideon  Howland  from 
1850-1853  and  captained  that  vessel  from  1853  to  1857,  then  was  captain  of  the  America 
from  1857  until  he  retired  in  1861.  Charles  Bryant  purchased  a  farm  in  Fairhaven,  Bristol 
County,  Massachusetts,  where  he  lived  when  not  at  sea.  The  U.S.  Census  for  1860,  the 
year  before  he  retired  from  whaling,  listed  him  as  a  farmer. 

While  serving  in  the  Massachusetts  legislature  in  1867  and  1868,  Bryant  made  the  ac¬ 
quaintance  of  U.S.  Senator  Charles  Sumner,  whose  April  9,  1867,  speech  before  Congress 
favoring  the  proposed  purchase  of  Alaska  was  based  in  part  on  letters  from  Bryant.53 
Sumner  cited  Bryants  expert  knowledge  of  Alaskan  waters,  including  the  “Behring  Sea,” 
and  that  recognition  became  widespread  when  newspapers  throughout  the  country 


26 


The  First  Three  Managers  ♦  Bryant 


printed  Sumner’s  now-famous  “Speech  of  Hon. 
Charles  Sumner  of  Massachusetts  on  the  cession 
of  Russian  America  to  the  United  States.”  In  part, 
Sumner  said: 

Here  is  a  letter  . . .  from  Charles  Bryant,  Esq., ...  for 
eighteen  years  acquainted  with  these  seas,  where 
he  was  engaged  in  the  Whale  Fishery.  After 
mentioning  the  time  at  certain  places  as  reason 
for  the  acquisition  of  these  possessions,  he  says: 

But  the  cheapest  value,  and  this  alone  is  worth 
more  than  the  pittance  asked  for  it,  consists  in  the 
extensive  Cod  and  Halibut  fish  grounds.54 

Sumner’s  speech  did  not  credit  Bryant  with 
any  mention  of  the  fur  seal,  although  Sumner  spe¬ 
cifically  identified  the  “Prybelov”  islands”55  and 
recognized  their  potential  value.56  In  the  short 
term  the  Pribilof  Islands  would  provide  the  most 
valuable  natural  resource  derived  from  the  Alaska 
purchase,  and  Bryant  would  help  make  it  so. 

In  a  letter  to  an  “Esteemed  Friend,”  Bryant  re¬ 
counted  his  experiences  traveling  to  Alaska  in  the 
employment  of  the  government,  excerpted  here:

I  left  New  York  on  the  16  of  Sept  in  the  good  steamer  Ocean  Queen  with  about  seven 
hundred  passengers  two  hundred  of  which  were  in  the  first  class  cabin  . . .  arriving  in  San 
Francisco  Oct  9th  having  made  the  run  in  2354  days  there  was  plenty  of  agreeable  society 

books,  games,  music,  and  dancing  on  board - Leaving  San  Francisco  Oct  30  after  a 

stormy  passage  we  arrived  in  Sitka  Nov  23rd  having  been  25  days  on  our  passage  the 
weather  stormy,  the  sea  rough  and  plenty  of  seasickness  for  my  colleagues.  The  Reliance 
is  a  topsail  schooner  240  tons  measurement  officered  by  a  Capt  and  four  lieutenants  and 
manned  by  forty  seamen. ...  in  sixty  eight  days,  I  have  traversed  two  oceans  traveling  eight 
thousand  miles  and  had  put  the  breadth  of  the  whole  continent  between  myself  and  home 
and  here  I  stood  in  Alaska  [like  a]  piece  of  human  driftwood  borne  on  the  crest  of  the 
advancing  wave  of  prayers  and  [thrown]  on  the  remotest  bound  of  civilization  but  a  truce 
to  romance  [-]  stern  realities  surround  us  as  you  will  learn  before  I  close. 


. . .  you  want  to  know  something  about  the  other  subject  the  resources  of  the  Territory 
here  I  can  only  touch  points  there  has  been  about  a  million  in  value  carried  from  here  in 
furs  which  is  largely  in  excess  of  what  the  territory  can  supply  without  exhaustion,  furs  are 
now  about  as  high  as  in  San  Francisco,  its  lumber  I  have  not  yet  seen  but  two  kinds  only 
one  of  very  great  value  the  other  the  common  Norway  spruce,  but  of  this  in  future  the 
great  coal  mine  about  eighty  miles  from  here  is  immense  croping  out  over  a  large  extent  of 
territory  close  to  the  shore  where  there  are  safe  bays  and  harbors  with  every  natural  facility 
for  shipping  it.  But  it  has  proved  to  [sic]  resinous  for  steamery  its  intense  heat  evolved 
burning  out  furnaces  and  smokestack  to  soon  when  we  get  an  improvement  to  protect  or 
guard  against  these  consequences  it  will  be  invaluable.  It  would  be  so  now  for  blasting  or 
smelting  purposes  I  am  told  by  those  who  have  been  to  see  it  that  along  its  face  where  it  has 
been  opened  its  [seams  are  shaped]  like  veined  marble  composed  of  resin  in  some  places 
six  inches  in  thickness  . . .  You  remember  what  I  said  about  whales  taking  shelter  in  the 
straits  and  bays  around  these  Islands,  everything  I  learn  confirms  my  former  convictions

all  traders  report  seeing  in  July  August  Sept  Oct  immense  numbers  so  close  together  as  to 
render  it  unsafe  for  boats  to  pass  among  them  but  I  have  seen  no  one  that  knows  what  kind 
they  were.3 

After  Captain  Bryant’s  retirement  from  the 
Massachusetts  legislature  on  July  30,  1877,  he 
acquired  and  operated  the  Old  Meigs  Tavern  at 
Mattapoisett,  Massachusetts.  The  tavern  was 
built  in  1799.58  He  renamed  it  Bay  View  Hotel, 
which  became  the  Mattapoisett  Inn  and  since 
2005  has  been  the  Kinsale  Inn,  advertised  as  the 
oldest  seaside  inn  in  the  United  States  still  oper¬ 
ating  in  its  original  structure.59 

A  writer  named  Catherine  Cabot  befriended 
Charles  Bryant  at  Mattapoisett  and  interviewed 
him  at  length,  planning  to  write  his  biography. 
Cabot  expected  to  derive  a  considerable  sum  of 
money  from  the  publication.60  However,  it  ap¬ 
pears  that  she  never  succeeded  in  publishing  the 
full  story,  but  she  did  publish  the  following  article

cords  and  his  autobiography  taken  by  Ms.  Cabot 
have  disappeared. 


Two  other  biographies  of  Captain  Bryant  were  published,  in  1897  and  1899;  and  a 
fourth  was  written,  but  not  published,  by  a  Mattapoisett  historian  in  1967.  A  comparison 
among  the  last  three  biographies  reveals  how  historical  facts  can  become  altered  in  time. 
The  1897  biography  was  written  as  follows. 


Charles  Bryant  was  born  May  9,  1820  in  Rochester,  Plymouth  County,  Massachusetts,  the 
son  of  William  Bryant  and  Mary  Johnson.  He  began  to  learn  the  sail-maker’s  trade  in  New 
Bedford  when  sixteen  years  of  age,  and  worked  at  it  for  four  years  and  a  half,  shipping 
then  as  a  sail-maker  on  the  whaling  brig  Montezuma  which  cruised  in  the  Atlantic  Ocean, 

and  was  out  eighteen  months.  His  next 
engagement  was  as  boat  steerer  on  the  ship 
Julian,  also  a  whaling  vessel,  which  was 
one  and  a  half  years  out  from  the  home 
port,  cruising  in  the  North  Pacific.  He  was 
subsequently  engaged  as  third  mate  of  the 
ship  Nimrod,  which  was  out  thirty-four 
months  in  the  Pacific  Ocean,  returning  as 
second  mate;  as  second  mate  on  the  Ohio, 
which  was  gone  three  years  in  the  same 
waters;  as  mate  of  the  ship  Euphrates,  which 
was  out  from  port  nearly  three  years;  and 
lastly,  as  mate  of  the  whaling  ship  John 
Howland,  which  cruised  in  the  Okhotsk  Sea 
Charles  Bryant  in  rocking  chair  at  the  and  the  Arctic  Seas,  being  gone  forty-four

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


A  CHAPTER  OF  ALASKA. 


REVIOUS  to  the 
year  1867,  the 
land  situated  at 
the  extreme 
northwest  cor- 
nerof  our 
North  Ameri¬ 
can  continent 
was  to  the  peo- 
p  1  e  of  our 
country  practi¬ 
cally  unknown. 
It  was  at  that 
time  called 
Russian  Amer¬ 
ica,  and  was  the 
outpost  of  its 
parent  country, 
its  only  indus¬ 
try  that  of  the 
fur  trade,  which  was  carried  on  by  an 
organized  company  of  traders  known 
as  the  Russian  American  Fur  Com¬ 
pany.  In  time,  as  the  rapid  growth  of 
our  Pacific  coast  developed  new  needs, 
a  company  was  formed  in  California  to 
furnish  ice  in  quantities,  to  be  brought 
from  Russian  America  to  the  port  of  San 
Francisco  and  from  there  distributed. 
In  furtherance  of  this  project  the  plan 
was  conceived  by  the  ice  company  to 
lease  the  province  from  its  owners.  This 
matter  was  in  due  course  privately  laid 
before  the  suitable  legislators  in  Wash¬ 
ington,  at  whose  councils  the  importance 
of  its  commercial  value  to  our  country  as 
a  source  of  revenue  became  more  and 
more  apparent ;  and  Mr.  Seward,  then 
our  secretary  of  state,  with  the  far-seeing 
wisdom  of  able  statesmanship,  proceeded 
to  enter  into  preliminary  negotiations  with 
the  Russian  government,  through  its  min¬ 
ister,  Baron  Stoeckl,  for  the  purchase  of 
Russian  America.  The  matter  was  prac¬ 
tically  confined  to  the  knowledge  of  the 
two  prime  ministers  and  to  the  few  others 
whose  interests  favored  privacy  in  its 
consideration  until  the  time  should  be 
688

ripe  to  report  it  to  the  senate  for  rat¬ 
ification. 

Those  were  troublous  times  at  the 
capital ;  the  senate  was  watching  the 
President's  supposed  dangerous  designs, 
and  the  people  were  watching  the  senate 
and  anxiously  waiting  the  issue.  But 
amid  all  the  clamor  of  angry  debate, 
Mr.  Seward  in  the  State  Department  was 
quietly  preparing  to  carry  out  his  long- 
cherished  plans  for  the  annexation  of 
Russian  America.  The  “540  40'  or  fight  ” 
measure  of  1 846,  which  would  have  carried 
us  to  the  southeast  boundary  of  Russian 
America,  had  failed  through  the  efforts 
of  those  opposed  to  any  further  northern 
extension  of  our  boundaries.  In  i860, 
in  a  speech  at  St.  Paul,  Mr.  Seward,  with 
sure  prescience,  had  said  :  — 

“  Standing  here  and  looking  far  off  into  the 
northwest,  I  see  the  Russian  as  he  busily  occupies 
himself  in  establishing  seaports  and  towns  and 
fortifications  on  the  verge  of  this  continent,  as  the 
outposts  of  St.  Petersburg,  and  I  can  say,  ‘  Go 
on  and  build  up  your  outposts  all  along  the  coast, 
up  even  to  the  Arctic  Ocean;  they  will  yet 
become  the  outposts  of  my  own  country  —  monu¬ 
ments  of  the  civilization  of  the  United  States  in 
the  northwest.’  ” 

Later,  during  our  civil  war,  his  obser¬ 
vation  of  the  disadvantages  under  which 
we  labored  for  lack  of  advanced  naval 
outposts  strengthened  his  determination 
to  obtain  such  a  foothold  of  power.  And 
now  at  last,  in  1867,  he  found  the  way 
opening  before  him.  Russia  was  to  us 
a  friendly  neighbor;  for  her  own  safety 
she  would  in  no  case  allow  her  American 
province  to  pass  into  the  hands  of  any 
European  power  through  whom  it  might 
become  to  her  a  future  menace.  Under 
American  control  it  would  be  to  her  a 
safeguard  through  its  more  rapid  develop¬ 
ment,  and  to  the  United  States  it  would 
become  an  important  stronghold  for  com¬ 
mercial  and  naval  operations  on  our 
Pacific  coast.  The  subject  presented  so 
many  mutual  advantages,  instead  of  con¬ 
flicting  interests,  that  all  minor  considera-

tions  were  easily  adjusted  ;  the  two  prime 
ministers,  Seward  and  Gortchakof,  were 
not  long  in  coming  to  an  agreement,  and 
its  satisfactory  conclusion  seemed  now 
well  assured. 

On  Friday  evening,  March  29,  the 
Czar’s  consent  to  the  cession  of  the 
territory  was  received  by  the  Russian 
minister,  who  hastened  at  once  to  the 
residence  of  Mr.  Seward,  as  the  impor¬ 
tance  of  the  case  made  it  necessary  to 
take  immediate  action  before  the  end  of 
the  session  now  near  at  hand.  Charles 
Sumner,  then  chairman  of  the  com¬ 
mittee  on  foreign  relations,  was  at  once 
summoned,  together  with  the  officials 
and  secretaries  necessary  to  prepare  the 
matter  for  submission  to  the  senate  ;  in 
less  than  two  hours  the  brightly  lighted 
windows  of  the  State  Department  indi¬ 
cated  that  business  was  going  on  there 
as  at  mid-day ;  and  with  so  great  de¬ 
spatch  was  it  conducted,  that  by  four 
o’clock  on  Saturday  morning  the  mid¬ 
night  treaty  was  engrossed,  signed,  sealed 
and  ready  for  transmission  by  the  Presi¬ 
dent.*  A  few  hours  iater,  when  the 
message  was  announced  in  the  chamber, 
great  was  the  surprise  of  all  when  the 
secretary  ejaculated  rather  than  read,  “A 
treaty  for  the  cession  of  Russian  Amer¬ 
ica,”  —  a  surprise  still  further  increased 
when  Mr.  Sumner,  a  leading  opponent 
of  the  President,  rose  to  move  favorable 
action,  asking  that  a  hearing  be  assigned 
for  it  on  the  following  week.  At  the 
hearing  in  executive  session  the  treaty 
was  almost  unanimously  confirmed,  con¬ 
ditional  on  an  appropriation  to  be  made 
by  Congress  to  pay  for  the  purchase 
within  a  year.  The  treaty  provided  that 
the  territory  should  be  surrendered  to 
the  United  States  as  soon  as  a  qualified 
official  should  arrive  from  Russia  to  per¬ 
form  that  duty.  Count  PeterschofF  was 
appointed  for  this  purpose ;  and  in  Sep¬ 
tember,  1867,  accompanied  by  General 
Rosecranz  and  the  necessary  military 
force,  he  proceeded  to  Sitka  to  perform 
the  transfer.  With  the  usual  ceremonies 
attendant  on  such  occasions,  the  Russian

flag  gave  place  to  our  own,  and  Russian 
America  became  United  States  territory. 
At  Mr.  Sumner’s  request,  the  name  Alaska, 
already  belonging  to  the  peninsula  of  that 
country,  was  retained  and  adopted  as 
that  of  the  whole  territory. 

The  treaty  was  ratified  April  9,  1867. 
The  United  States  had  taken  possession 
of  the  new  territory,  but  had  not  paid 
for  it.  Measures  were  necessary  to  be 
taken  at  once  to  formulate  some  suitable 
plan  of  government  which  could  be  main¬ 
tained  for  the  best  good  of  the  native 
people  there  belonging  and  for  the 
increase  of  our  own  revenue  as  might 
be.  We  had  acquired  a  peculiar  pos¬ 
session,  needing  peculiar  and  hitherto 
untried  forms  of  government.  It  was 
a  crisis  in  which  no  one  seemed  to  know 
quite  the  best  thing  to  be  done  nor  the 
best  way  to  proceed ;  the  most  that  was 
known  of  the  region  was  that  it  was 
unknown  and  ice-bound.  But  as  in  all 
history,  the  right  man,  the  God-sent 
man,  has  always  been  found  for  the  emer¬ 
gency,  so  in  this  case,  one  who  had 
retired  from  his  long  whaling  voyages 
in  the  Pacific  seas,  which  had  furnished 
abundant  opportunity  for  thorough  and 
complete  observation  of  every  form  of 
natural  phenomena  thereto  pertaining, 
whose  brain  had  become  a  well-filled 
storehouse  of  valuable  knowledge  available 
for  just  this  or  similar  occasion  when  it 
should  arise,  who  had  in  the  retirement 
of  his  private  life  been  sought  for  and 
elected  a  member  of  the  Massachusetts 
legislature,  there  becoming  acquainted 
with  some  of  the  leading  men  in  public 
affairs,  and  through  them  with  scientific 
experts  and  with  influential  Washington 
legislators,  thus  by  successive  steps  mak¬ 
ing  the  necessary  connecting  links  in  the 
chain  of  events  which  was  to  bind  our 
new  possession  into  harmonious  and 
suitable  relations  with  already  existing 
conditions,  and  to  open  out  new  avenues 
of  interest,  of  profit  and  of  usefulness,  — 
this  one  of  all  others  in  our  country  best 
fitted  for  the  emergency  awaiting,  after 
his  many  years  of  almost  unconscious 
preparation,  was  found  well  equipped  and 
ready  for  his  country’s  service  at  her  call 
of  need.  Upon  him  devolved  the  task  to 
investigate,  to  formulate  and  to  carry  to

completion  plans  for  mutual  benefit, — 
the  work  of  a  statesman  and  of  a  philan¬ 
thropist,  of  a  man  sound  in  knowledge 
of  the  world’s  affairs,  of  good  judgment 
and  of  unimpeachable  integrity,  unselfish 
and  incorruptible. 

Providentially  the  man  and  the  hour 
had  met.  Hugh  McCulloch,  then  secre¬ 
tary  of  the  treasury,  at  the  instance  of 
several  eminent  men,  after  due  confer¬ 
ence  with  Charles  Bryant,  appointed  him 
as  special  agent  subject  to  the  authority 
and  supervision  of  the  Treasury  Depart¬ 
ment  which  had  assumed  charge  of  affairs 
in  our  new  territory,  with  instructions  to 
proceed  to  the  Pribylov  Islands,  the 
home  of  the  fur  seal  industry  which  had 
proved  of  so  great  value  to  its  former 
owners,  to  investigate  the  conditions 
there  existing,  and  to  report  upon  the 
necessary  steps  to  be  taken  for  the  sub¬ 
sistence  of  the  people  and  for  the  pro¬ 
tection  and  furtherance  of  our  own  inter¬ 
ests  as  well.  In  this  relation  Captain 
Bryant,  in  pursuance  of  his  duties  on  the 
islands,  resided  there  for  several  years, 
during  four  presidential  terms,  and  under 
the  supervision  of  seven  successive  treas¬ 
ury  secretaries,  instituting  and  perfecting 
the  various  systems  of  living,  of  educa¬ 
tion  and  of  industry  which  have  con¬ 
tinued  to  the  present  time.  It  is  of  him 
in  this  peculiar  relation  that  the  present 
paper  treats. 

Born  in  Plymouth  County,  Massachu¬ 
setts,  of  the  sturdy  Pilgrim  stock  whose 
independence  and  integrity  impressed  its 
character  so  strongly  on  the  beginnings  of 
our  Nevv  England  history,  his  earlier  years 
were  passed,  like  those  of  all  sons  of  the 
industrious  farmers  whose  occupation  was 
confined  to  achieving  not  only  a  liveli¬ 
hood,  but  the  comforts  of  that  time,  in 
the  multitude  of  duties  more  or  less 
arduous  and  shared  by  all  alike,  with  but 
little  schooling  except  that  obtained  from 
the  open  book  of  nature  surrounding 
and  enriching  the  minds  of  all  its  pupils 
who  had  eyes  to  observe  and  ability  to 
learn  its  lessons.  Doubly  fortunate  was 
he  in  the  fact  that  the  large  farming 
country  in  which  his  boyhood  years  were 
passed  was  also  a  seaport  (now  long  since 
in  its  decadence),  whose  industry  of  ship¬ 
building  furnished  an  opportunity  for

profitable  maintenance  to  the  lads  whose 
desires  or  whose  needs  prompted  them  to 
seek  for  such  outside  the  home  life  ;  and 
beyond  this  employment  the  next  step  out 
and  away  into  the  world  was  by  the  whal¬ 
ing  industry,  the  source  of  many  large 
fortunes  during  the  thirty  years  or  more 
in  which  it  flourished  so  prosperously  in 
the  years  following  1830.  From  the 
farming  towns  all  over  New  England  it 
recruited  its  workers,  offering  to  them 
attractive  inducements  to  see  some  part 
of  the  great  world  outside  of  and  beyond 
their  circumscribed  opportunities  for 
knowledge ;  and  among  others  we  find 
our  country  lad,  his  brain  teeming  with 
glorious  day-dreams  of  future  possibili¬ 
ties,  exiling  himself  from  his  boyhood 
home  with  its  beloved  inmates,  hoping 
thus  to  secure  a  surer  and  larger  compe¬ 
tence  for  their  future  when  the  disability 
of  increasing  years  should  render  them 
less  able  for  their  laborious  and  constant 
work.  Six  voyages  were  made  by  him 
during  the  eighteen  years  from  1840  to 
1858,  covering  all  latitudes  from  sixty  de¬ 
grees  south  to  the  frozen  barrier  of  the 
Northern  Arctic  Sea  in  latitude  seventy- 
two  degrees,  through  all  seas  inhabited

by  whales;  and  in  pursuit  of  this  calling 
he  visited  most  of  the  various  islands 
therein  situated,  making  himself  familiar 
in  every  instance  where  it  was  possible 
for  him  to  do  so  with  the  manners  and 
customs  of  the  people  and  with  their  na¬ 
tive  language. 

In  1867  and  1868  he  was  called  to  the 
Massachusetts  legislature  to  represent  the 
district  in  which  he  then  resided.  Here 
again  in  quite  a  different  field  were  this 
man’s  talents  of  observation,  of  well-cul¬ 
tivated  memory  and  of  disposition  to  use¬ 
fulness  in  whatever  line  of  life-work  he 
was  called  upon  to  fill  to  stand  him  in

good  stead.  Not  lightly  did  he  regard 
the  fulfilment  of  any  duty  intrusted  to  his 
care  ;  and  in  the  pursuance  of  his  official 
duties  the  impress  which  he  left  upon 
the  minds  of  his  associates  was  to 
open  up  to  him  further  opportunities 
and  heretofore  undreamed-of  possibili¬ 
ties.  Here  he  came  in  contact  with 
other  scientific  minds ;  and  through  a 
vote  of  his  own  favorable  to  the  appro¬ 
priation  of  a  sum  of  money  for  use  by 
Agassiz  in  the  preservation  of  the  re¬ 
markable  Brazil  collection,  his  own  wide 
and  thorough  knowledge  of  the  family 
of  fishes  of  nearly  every  kind  became 
known  to  the  men  who  shortly  were 
to  seek  this  knowledge  absolutely  un¬ 


attainable  through  any  other  of  our  own 
people. 

One  morning  in  the  spring  of  1868 
the  press  all  over  the  country  spread 
abroad  the  surprising  announcement  of 
Mr.  Sumner’s  submission  to  the  senate  of 
Mr.  Seward’s  treaty  (as  it  was  called) 
for  our  purchase  of  Alaska ;  and  great 
the  wonder  grew.  Laughable  were  the 
comments  and  ridiculous  the  criticisms 
of  those  all  uninformed,  the  general 
public  feeling  being  one  of  doubt  as  to 
any  possible  benefit  which  could  accrue 
to  us  from  the  possession  of  so  vast  an 
adjunct  to  our  landed  possessions.  Some 
witty  ones  made  merry  in  rhyme  as  ex¬ 
travagantly  set  forth  as  possible,  as  may 
be  seen  in  the  following  verses  from  a 
Boston  paper  at  that  time  :  — 

“  Know  ye  the  land  where  the  iceberg  and  myrtle 

With  early  geen  peas  and  walrus  combine? 

Where  the  Esquimaux  sups  upon  truffles  and 
turtle. 

And  the  white  polar  bears  upon  Esquimaux 
dine? 

Where  the  roses  are  blooming  all  the  year 
round, 

And  the  oranges  ripen  with  snow  on  the 
ground  ? 

I  Where  the  polar  bear  howls  in  the  barley  and 
wheat, 

And  the  settlers  are  howling  for  something  to 
eat? 

Oh,  know  ye  that  land?  ’Tis  the  land  of  the 
ice; 

’Tis  a  big  Russian  land  at  a  rushin’  big  price.” 

and  also  these  from  San  Francisco  :  — 

“  Lean  of  flank,  and  lank  of  jaw. 

See  the  real  Northern  Thor  !

With  its  lingual  disguises, 

Lo,  the  Arctic  prologue  rises :

The  First  Three  Managers  ♦  Bryant 


A  CHAPTER  OF  ALASKA. 


’Twould  be  strange  if  there  should  be  — 

Seems  I’ve  heerd  such  stones  told; 

Eh !  —  why,  bless  us  —  yes,  ’tis  gold  !  ” 

On  the  public  announcement  of  the  in¬ 
tended  purchase,  Captain  Bryant’s  inter 
est  in  the  matter  was  so  great  that  he  at 
once  consulted  several  prominent  men 
how  best  to  take  action,  which  resulted 
in  their  telegraphing  to  Mr.  Sumner  that 
one  of  the  members  of  the  Massachu¬ 
setts  legislature  was  thoroughly  familiar 
with  the  region  of  Alaska,  and  asking  if 
his  information  would  be  of  value.  Mr. 
Sumner  replied  that,  although  he  had 
volumes  of  Russian  records,  the  practical 
evidence  of  a  living  witness  would  be  in¬ 
valuable.  Captain  Bryant  therefore  im¬ 
mediately  sent  to  Mr.  Sumner  such  por¬ 
tions  of  his  private  journals  as  bore 
directly  upon  the  case,  which  testimony 
was  made  use  of  in  Mr.  Sumner’s  argu¬ 
ment  favoring  the  purchase,  and  portions 
of  it  were  printed  entire,  which  proved 
of  great  value  in  the  consummation  of 
the  treaty.  Mr.  Sumner  afterward  re¬ 
ferred  publicly  to  Captain  Bryant’s  aid  at 
that  time,  in  these  kindly  words  :  “  Gen¬ 
tlemen,  next  to  myself  you  owe  it  to  Cap¬ 
tain  Bryant  that  we  were  successful  in 
purchasing  so  valuable  a  territory.” 

The  Treasury  Department,  on  assuming 
control  of  affairs,  at  once  fitted  up  a 
revenue  cutter  for  active  service,  whose 
charts  were  referred  to  Captain  Bryant 
for  accurate  revision,  as  here  again 
he  alone  could  furnish  the  information 
needed;  and  in  September,  1868,  he 
himself,  acting  as  agent  for  the  Treasury 
Department,  set  sail  for  the  Seal  Islands, 
via  Panama,  to  San  Francisco,  thence  to 
Sitka.  But  at  that  point  he  found  himself 
farther  from  his  destination  than  if  he  had 
remained  in  San  Francisco.  In  March, 
1869,  however,  he  reached  the  islands 
by  a  chance  merchant  vessel;  and  after 
passing  the  entire  sealing  season  in  a 
careful  and  thorough  study  of  existing 
conditions,  be  returned  to  YVashington  to 
lay  his  report  before  the  Treasury  Depart¬ 
ment,  in  which  report  he  recommended 
methods  of  necessary  legislation. 

Owing  to  delay  in  affairs  at  Washington, 
the  final  consummation  of  our  purchase 
did  not  take  effect  until  July  27,  1868  ; 
and  at  that  date,  acting  on  authentic 


593 

information  regarding  the  indiscriminate 
slaughter  of  the  seals  by  various  raiding 
parties  from  many  ports,  immediately  fol¬ 
lowing  the  transfer  of  the  islands,  and 
before  our  own  officials  could  arrive  there, 
Congress,  in  the  absence  of  any  knowledge 
of  the  habits  of  the  seals  and  the  needs 
of  the  people,  passed  a  law  prohibiting  all 
killing. 

Up  to  the  time  of  Captain  Bryant’s 
arrival  at  the  Seal  Islands  in  1868,  noth¬ 
ing  had  been  known  of  the  habits  of  the 
fur  seals,  though  they  first  became  known 
to  commerce  through  the  discovery  of 
their  nurseries  on  the  rocky  islands  around 
Terra  del  Fuego  and  in  the  Southern 
Atlantic  and  Indian  Oceans ;  and  in  this 
direction,  therefore,  a  close  study  had  to 
be  made  of  their  needs  and  conditions. 
The  natural  laws  controlling  their  life  were 
found  to  be  inexorable,  differing  in  im¬ 
portant  degree  from  those  governing  all 
other  varieties  of  their  species.  As  their  • 
young  are  not  amphibious  before  fifty  or 
sixty  days  old,  it  is  necessary  for  their 
successful  rearing  that  they  should  be 
born  on  land  and  remain  there  until  able 
to  swim.  Special  conditions  of  climate 
are  requisite,  such  as  are  found  on  these 
islands  alone,  situated  where  the  colder 
current  from  Norton  Sound  meets  the 
warm  Japan  current  that  passes  through 
the  openings  between  the  Aleutian  Islands, 
producing  a  humid  condition  of  atmos¬ 
phere  through  the  summer  months,  often 
registering  ninety-six  per  cent  of  obscura¬ 
tion  of  the  sun.  The  male  seals  begin 
to  land  in  May,  the  whole  herd  following 
in  increasing  numbers,  staying  until 
November,  when  they  return  to  the  deep 
waters  and  remain  until  the  next  spring. 
During  these  months  on  land,  if  the 
mothers  are  killed  in  their  brief  absences 
from  their  young  necessary  to  obtain  food 
for  themselves,  the  young  seals  perish. 
The  males  while  on  land  partake  of  no 
food,  subsisting  entirely  on  the  store  of 
fat  and  oil  laid  up  in  their  blubber  through 
the  winter  season  when  they  annually 
return  to  feed  in  the  open  waters  between 
the  islands  and  the  mainland.  It  is  in 
these  waters  alone  that  an  amount  of  food 
is  found  of  fish  and  of  marine  life  neces¬ 
sary  to  sustain  them  for  the  ensuing 
season.  Some  conception  of  the  vast 


35 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


594  A  CHAPTER 

quantity  of  animal  life  which  exists  in 
these  waters  may  be  obtained  from  the 
knowledge  that  each  of  the  five  million 
seals  that  leave  the  islands  to  feed  re¬ 
quires  at  least  six  pounds  of  fish  per  day, 
—  thirty  million  pounds  of  food  daily  for 
all.  It  is  on  their  passage  through  and 
near  these  straits  that  the  seals  have 
been  wantonly  slaughtered  by  raiders  who 
hunted  them  in  vessels. 

The  full-grown  male  seal  weighs  between 
two  and  three  hundred  pounds ;  the  full- 
grown  female,  about  eighty  pounds.  Never 
more  than  one  seal  is  produced  at  a  birth, 
its  weight  being  about  five  pounds. 

A  short  time  before  Mr.  Seward’s 
death,  he  explained  to  Captain  Bryant 
the  details  of  a  plan  for  making  a  treaty 
with  Russia,  by  which  the  two  nations 
should  have  the  joint  control  of  those 
northern  waters  and  their  fisheries,  saying 
that  it  was  a  source  of  deep  regret  to 
him  that  his  successor  in  office  in  the 
State  Department  had  allowed  the  matter 
to  lapse.  At  the  time  we  bought  Alaska 
he  had  already  formed  this  plan,  his 
attention  being  called  to  its  necessity  by 
the  fishery  troubles  then  existing  and  by 
his  desire  to  guard  against  any  future 
contingency  that  might  arise  in  that  direc¬ 
tion.  He  had  therefore  carefully  com¬ 
piled  all  possible  data  and  statistics  for 
use  when  the  matter  should  be  ripe  for 
action,  —  a  matter  the  importance  of 
which  grew  on  his  mind  with  every  day 
of  his  life,  and  which  he  had  learned  to 
consider  one  of  the  greatest  acts  of  his 
statesmanship,  destined  to  be  regarded 
in  our  future  history  with  ever-increasing 
appreciation  of  his  wisdom  and  foresight 
in  its  successful  achievement. 

In  March,  1870,  Captain  Bryant  was 
sent  to  the  Pacific  coast  on  a  private 
mission  for  the  government;  and  while 
there,  learning  from  reliable  sources  of  the 
destitute  condition  of  the  natives  result¬ 
ing  from  the  enforcement  of  the  law 
passed  by  Congress  the  previous  year, 
prohibiting  all  killing,  —  for  without  com¬ 
merce  the  people  would  need  to  depend 
absolutely  upon  the  seals  for  food,  fuel 
and  clothing, —  he  laid  the  matter  at 
once  before  the  Treasury  Department,  on 
which  he  was  detached  from  the  private 
mission,  and  was  ordered  to  proceed  at 


OF  ALASKA. 

once  to  the  Seal  Islands  on  a  revenue  vessel 
with  supplies  for  the  natives,  there  to  take 
charge  until  Congress  should  enact  the 
necessary  laws  for  suitable  protection. 

In  Captain  Bryant’s  preliminary  report 
of  1869,  he  submitted  first  and  chief  of 
all  his  conviction  that  the  care  and  pro¬ 
tection  of  the  seals  by  well-regulated 
methods  would  tend  not  only  to  support 
the  natives  comfortably,  but  to  pay  a  con¬ 
siderable  revenue  to  the  United  States  by 
the  adoption  of  a  proper  system  of  man¬ 
agement  and  control.  Grafting  a  plan, 
therefore,  on  the  former  somewhat  inade¬ 
quate  methods  of  the  Russian  govern¬ 
ment,  he  recommended  that  the  islands 
be  leased  to  some  single  company  for 
the  right  to  take  a  certain  number  of 
seals  under  proper  restrictions  and  con¬ 
ditions,  with  reference  to  the  rights  and 
needs  of  the  people  and  the  requirements 
of  the  Treasury  Department.  This  course 
would  be  necessary  in  order  that  the  offi¬ 
cer  in  charge  of  the  islands  might  have 
full  authority  to  secure  the  enforcement  of 
the  conditions  ;  for  if  more  than  one  party 
were  allowed  to  trade  with  the  natives, 
their  competition  would  give  rise  to  irreg¬ 
ularities  which  could  not  be  traced  or 
fixed  upon  any  one,  and  the  result  would 
be  prejudicial  to  the  welfare  of  the  people. 
Captain  Bryant’s  plan  as  submitted  to  our 
government  was  adopted  with  modifica¬ 
tions  as  needs  arose ;  and  as  a  result  of 
his  recommendations  the  islands  were 
leased  to  the  Alaska  Commercial  Com¬ 
pany  under  certain  conditions,  in  addi¬ 
tion  to  which  the  company  voluntarily 
agreed  to  furnish  a  resident  physician  on 
each  island,  with  all  the  medicines  neces¬ 
sary  for  the  gratuitous  care  of  the  na¬ 
tives  ;  to  furnish  also  materials  and  skilled 
labor  to  aid  them  in  building  their  cot¬ 
tages  ;  and  at  a  later  date  they  also  im¬ 
ported  a  library  of  Russian  books  for  the

In  October,  1870,  the  first  vessel  of  the 
Alaska  Commercial  Company  arrived  with 
its  load  of  supplies  for  the  natives,  bring¬ 
ing  its  own  authority  as  lessee  and  also 
official  instructions  for  Captain  Bryant  to 
execute  the  plans  as  already  set  forth  by 
him.  At  this  time  there  were  two  hun¬

A  CHAPTER 


Island,  the  headquarters  of  the  settle¬ 
ment,  mostly  Aleuts  from  the  Aleutian 
Islands,  with  a  proportion  of  creole  blood, 
or  a  mixture  of  Russians  and  natives, 
most  of  whom  had  been  brought  from 
Sitka  on  the  transfer  of  the  territory. 
This  creole  element  was  of  great  service 
from  having  seen  better  conditions  of 
life,  and  from  having  acquired  sufficient 
knowledge  of  the  Russian  language  to  be 
able  to  speak  it ;  this  was  our  only  means 
of  communication  with  the  natives,  the 
Aleutian  language  being  too  difficult  to 
acquire  by  speech.  The  native  people 
are  undoubtedly  of  the  same  origin  as  the 
Japanese,  their  ancestors  having  probably 
drifted  in  vessels  to  these  shores  where 
they  found  the  conditions  of  life  severe 
and  strange,  and  at  so  remote  a  period 
as  to  have  lost  the  use  of  their  native 
language  ;  but  no  marked  change  has  oc¬ 
curred  in  their  physique,  they  having 
been  frequently  recognized  by  native 
Japanese  as  of  their  own  race,  though 
speaking  an  unknown  tongue. 

Congress  having  thus  in  1870  author¬ 
ized  a  fixed  condition  of  the  affairs  of 
the  islands  by  leasing  them  to  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company  for  twenty  years,  it 
next  became  important  to  administer  the 
civil  affairs  through  a  regular  staff  of  offi¬ 
cials  ;  and  for  information  in  this  direc¬ 
tion  Captain  Bryant  was  summoned  to 
Washington  in  1871  to  confer  with  the 
heads  of  the  Treasury  Department  as  to 
the  best  methods  to  be  pursued.  As  a 
result  it  was  determined  that  the  staff 
consist  of  four  officers,  —  the  agent,  one 
first  assistant  and  two  second  assistants. 
As  it  would  be  best  that  on  the  score  of 
health  each  one  should  leave  the  islands 
every  second  year,  it  would  be  necessary 
that  two  competent  officers  should  be  al¬ 
ways  in  charge  with  the  necessary  knowl¬ 
edge  for  the  proper  performance  of  the 
duties  required  ;  and  Captain  Bryant,  as 
duly  accredited  agent  of  our  Treasury 
Department,  in  the  spring  of  1872,  was 
permitted  to  personally  select  his  own  as¬ 
sistants,  and  was  himself  invested  with 
full  official  authority. 

To  realize  more  clearly  the  wide  scope 
of  this  undertaking,  we  will  consider  the 
geographical  situation  of  our  new  pur¬ 
chase.  Alaska  itself  is  two  thousand  eight

hundred  miles  from  east  to  west,  and 
over  seven  hundred  miles  north  to  south, 
or  about  twelve  times  the  size  of  New 
York  state ;  but  stretching  away  and 
beyond  Alaska  in  a  southwesterly  direc¬ 
tion  is  a  long  chain  of  islands,  the  western 
extremity  of  which  is  farther  west  of  San 
Francisco  than  is  the  distance  from  that 
city  eastward  to  the  coast  of  Maine.*  And 
two  hundred  miles  north  of  this  chain, 
situated  nearly  in  the  middle  of  Behring 
Sea,  lies  the  Pribylov  group  known  as  the 
Fur  Sea  Islands.  They  are  four  in  num¬ 
ber,  St.  Paul,  St.  George,  Otter  and 
Walrus,  the  two  latter  being  only  small 
outlying  rocks  of  St.  Paul’s  Island.  These 
islands  were  to  prove  by  far  the  most 
valuable  part  of  our  purchase,  from  the 
fact  of  their  being  the  yearly  resort  of 
the  fur  seal  in  enormous  numbers,  from 
the  wise  management  of  which  as  a 
source  of  revenue  our  government  hoped 
to  secure  valuable  returns.  They  are  of 
volcanic  formation,  seemingly  of  more 
recent  eruption  than  the  Aleutian  chain, 
and  are  distant  three  hundred  miles  from 
the  nearest  point  of  mainland  on  the 
north. 

As  to  the  part  allotted  by  our  special 
agent  to  the  people  themselves  in  the 
conduct  of  their  affairs,  he  improved  upon 
the  former  Russian  methods,  without 
decided  change,  and  appointed  one  of 
the  leading  chiefs  to  act  as  his  executive 
officer,  whose  duty  it  was  to  report  to 
him  at  night  all  the  occurrences  of  the 
day,  as  to  the  number  of  seals  killed  and 
all  other  matters  requiring  his  cognizance. 
This  plan  was  gradually  developed  and 
modified  from  time  to  time  as  the  condi¬ 
tions  seemed  to  direct  and  as  new  neces¬ 
sities  arose.  As  Captain  Bryant  reported 
to  the  department  at  Washington  only 

*  Wolf  Island,  Maine,  and  Attow,  the  western  extremity 
of  the  Aleutian  chain,  are  the  extremest  distances  of  the 
United  States  possessions.  They  are  7000  miles  apart.

once  a  year,  he  had  ample  time  to  test 
the  value  of  his  experiments  and  to  prove 
them ;  when  found  satisfactory,  they  were 
legalized  by  the  government  on  his  sub¬ 
mission.  In  this  simple  manner  affairs 
were  conducted  systematically  step  by 
step  and  without  any  friction.  In  cases 
of  misdemeanor  which  required  judicial 
action,  three  chiefs  were  constituted  a 
council  to  examine  and  to  report  their 
opinion  and  decision,  subject  always  to 
the  agent’s  approval.  So  just  and  honest 
were  these  men  that  seldom  were  any 
changes  necessary  to  be  made.  Their 
veracity  in  all  matters  coming  up  for 
settlement  Captain  Bryant  testifies  he 
never  had  reason  to  question,  and  he 
never  knew  of  an  attempt  at  evasion. 
They  were  men  who  in  any  civilized  com¬ 
munity  would  have  been  natural  leaders 
of  social  law  and  order. 

To  these  simple  people,  from  out  the 
mists  that  surrounded  their  isolated  island 
home,  had  appeared  in  substantial  vision 
the  apostle  of  the  era  of  better  things. 
To  their  sick  he  had  ministered,  their 
children  he  had  educated,  their  civil 
government  he  had  perfected.  In  all 
material  comforts  through  him  they  lacked 
nothing,  and  him  they  reverenced  equally 
with  their  religious  director.  Patriarchal 


in  its  simplicity  was  his  attitude  toward 
them  in  his  efforts  for  their  welfare  as 
a  community ;  physically,  mentally  and 
spiritually,  through  him  had  their  dormant 
faculties  been  awakened,  and  they  had 
grown  to  their  full  stature.  Naturally 
their  feeling  for  him  had  come  to  be  one 
of  unbounded  love  and  gratitude. 

Their  final  parting  I  will  give  in  Cap¬ 
tain  Bryant’s  own  words  :  “  The  relations 
between  the  people  and  myself  had  be¬ 
come  so  close  and  had  continued  so  long 
that  the  parting  was  a  heartfelt  one  on 
both  sides.  They  all  attended  us  to  the 
beach  on  our  departure  and  gathered 
around  us,  loath  to  have  us  leave  them. 
Many  shed  tears,  and  I  must  confess  1 
was  very  near  it  myself.  When  the  final 
adieus  were  said  they  all  assured  us  that 
they  should  go  to  the  church  to  pray  for 
our  safe  passage  and  happy  arrival  home, 
and  that  they  should  never  pray  for  them¬ 
selves  without  remembering  and  praying 
for  us.  The  last  sound  of  their  voices  as 
we  left  the  shore  was  Esc  Bogh  am  (God 
bless  you)  ;  and  our  last  sight  of  them 
was  as  they  stood  upon  the  cliffs  waving 
their  handkerchiefs  as  our  ship  steamed 
away  into  the  distance.  I  would  rather 
have  their  benediction  than  that  of  the 
highest  bishop  in  the  world.”

Deciding  then  to  retire  from  the  sea,  Mr.  Bryant  purchased  a  farm  at  East  Fairhaven,  where 
he  resided  some  twelve  years;  but  fortune  had  not  willed  that  he  should  retire  to  private 
life  so  soon,  and  he  was  called  from  his  farm  to  undertake  a  mission  to  Alaska  to  report 
on  the  fur-seal  interest  in  that  vicinity.  He  was  given  charge  of  the  islands  in  the  Behring 
Sea,  receiving  his  appointment  from  Hugh  McCulloch,  then  Secretary  of  the  United  States 
Treasury,  and  spent  the  winter  of  1868  at  Sitka,  returning  to  his  home  in  September  1869. 
In  March  1870,  he  was  sent  again  to  the  islands  in  the  seal  region  and  given  authority  to  act 
as  governor  of  the  natives  receiving  his  appointment  from  George  S.  Boutwell,  Secretary 
of  the  Treasury.  There  he  remained  until  1877,  when  he  returned  to  the  old  Bay  State  and 
settled  in  Mattapoisett,  his  home  up  to  the  present  time. 

Captain  Bryant  was  married  in  1851  to  Miss  Hannah  Eldridge,  daughter  of  Peleg  and 
Hannah  (Biggs)  Eldridge,  of  Taunton,  Mass.  He  has  no  children.62  He  has  long  been 
interested  in  public  affairs,  and  has  held  a  number  of  offices  of  trust.  In  1867  and 
1868,  while  a  resident  of  Fairhaven,  he  occupied  a  seat  in  the  State  legislature;  and  in 
Mattapoisett,  he  has  served  as  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Health,  and  as  a  member  of  the 
School  Board  for  four  years.  He  is  a  man  of  ability,  who  efficiently  performs  all  duties 
entrusted  to  him.63

The  First  Three  Managers  ♦  Bryant 


The  1889  biography  used  the  colonial  term  “governor,”  which  was  commonly  applied 
in  Russian  America  and  the  early  Territory  of  Alaska  to  men  in  authority.  The  usage  was 
misapplied  in  Bryants  1899  biography,  which  labeled  him  the  “First  Governor  of  Alaska.” 

Capt.  Charles  Bryant,  born  in  Old  Rochester  [Massachusetts],  near  Rounseville’s  Mill,  and 
now  residing  in  Mattapoisett,  had  the  distinction  of  being  the  “First  Governor  of  Alaska.” 

Many  years  ago,  while  in  Boston  as  a  member  of  the  Legislature,  he  made  the  acquaintance 
ot  [Louis]  Agassiz  and  [Senator]  Charles  Sumner.  After  the  Alaska  purchase,  Sumner  wrote 
to  Agassiz  to  know  where  he  could  find  “that  Arctic  whale  captain  who  knew  so  much 
about  seals.  The  result  was  that  Captain  Bryant  was  put  in  charge  of  the  seal  fisheries  at 
Sitka,  retaining  that  office  for  a  number  of  years.64 

The  term  “governor”  was  also  applied  to  two  other  Pribilof  Islands  agents,  but  those 
writings  limited  the  agents’  influence  to  the  Seal  Islands:  “Practically  speaking,”  says  one 
such  reference,  “the  Government  agents  are  the  Governors  of  the  islands  in  connection 
with  the  management  of  the  Seal  Business.”65 

The  obituary  of  Special  Agent  William  Gavitt  called  Bryant  “former  broker  and 
Governor  of  Seal  Island,  Alaska.”66 

As  is  apparent  from  these  writings,  the  labels  “Governor”  and  “Agent”  were  used  syn¬ 
onymously  to  describe  the  government  agents  during  that  period. 

In  the  fourth  biography,  Mattapoisett  historian  Charles  Mendell  applied  the  title  of 
“Governor”  to  honor  local  celebrity  Charles  Bryant.  The  term  remains  in  use  today  by 
some  residents  in  the  Mattapoisett  and  Rochester  areas  of  Massachusetts  who  are  quite 
proud  of  their  hometown  hero.  Mr.  Mendell’s  unpublished  biography  reads: 

YEARS  AGO 

CAPTAIN  CHARLES  BRYANT,  FIRST  GOVERNOR  OF  ALASKA 

Few  people  today  remember  one  of  Mattapoisett’s  most  distinguished  citizens,  Capt. 

Charles  R.  Bryant,  the  first  governor  of  Alaska,  which  is  this  year  celebrating  the  centennial 
of  its  purchase  from  Russia  by  the  United  States  in  1867.  Capt.  Bryant  also  played  a 
prominent  part  in  the  decision  to  buy  Alaska,  then  spent  ten  years  administering  the 
territory,  and  upon  his  return  retired  to  Mattapoisett  where  he  lived  the  last  25  years  of  his 
life  in  what  is  now  the  Mattapoisett  Inn  on  Water  Street. 

Capt.  Bryant  was  born  on  a  Rochester  [Massachusetts]  farm  in  1820,  one  of  a  family  of 
seven.  The  farm  boy  early  became  acquainted  with  Mattapoisett  by  picking  fruit  in  the 
summer  months  and  carrying  it  to  Mattapoisett — on  foot  most  of  the  time — to  Harlow 
and  LeBaron’s  general  store  (building  now  housing  Dr.  Mysliwy’s  office)  to  be  sold  to  the 
ship  carpenters  in  the  shipyards  along  the  waterfront.  Before  long  he  was  employed  by  the 
store  as  general  errand  boy.  In  this  way  he  became  familiar  with  all  the  hustle  and  bustle  of 
a  busy  seaport  and  with  the  constant  arrivals  and  departures  of  whalers  and  the  constant 
tales  of  whaling. 

At  the  age  of  20,  he  shipped  on  a  New  Bedford  whaler,  the  Montezuma.  In  the  next  18  years 
he  made  six  voyages  covering  the  Pacific  Ocean,  as  he  used  to  say,  from  latitude  60  degrees 
south  to  latitude  72  degrees  north,  from  the  Antarctic  to  the  Arctic.  His  second  voyage,  on 
the  Ship  Champion,  took  him  to  the  Northwest  Pacific  Coast,  as  did  his  four  subsequent 
voyages.  It  was  on  these  voyages  that  he  acquired  that  intimate  knowledge  of  the  Alaskan 
coast  and  Aleutian  Islands  that  later  made  him  a  logical  choice  as  the  government’s  first 
administrator  of  the  new  territory. 


39 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


On  this  second  voyage  on  the  Champion, 
the  ship’s  master  was  killed  by  the  breading 
[breaking]67  of  a  tackle-fall  and  young 
Bryant  was  evidently  promoted  to  boat 
steerer  or  harpooner.  At  any  rate,  on  his 
next  voyage  he  shipped  as  third  mate 
on  the  ship  Abraham  Barker,  and  on 
the  following  voyage  as  second  mate  of 
the  Ship  Gideon  Howard.  His  two  final 
voyages  he  sailed  as  captain,  first  of  the 
Gideon  Howland  and  second  of  the  ship 
America.  On  this  voyage  Capt.  Bryant 
carried  a  steam  whale  boat  to  be  tried  as 
an  experiment,  but  for  some  reason  it  was 
never  used.  (Perhaps  nobody  knew  how  to 
run  it.) 

Sometime  between  voyages  Capt.  Bryant  found  time  to  marry  Miss  Hannah  Eldredge  of 
New  Bedford.  When  he  returned  on  the  America  in  May  of  1861,  he  retired  from  the  sea 
and  bought  a  farm  and  built  a  house  in  East  Fairhaven  where  he  and  his  wife  went  to  live.  In 
1867  and  1868  he  was  elected  to  the  state  legislature.  It  is  interesting  to  speculate  whether 
Capt.  Bryant  considered  his  active  life  over  and  was  looking  forward  to  many  peaceful 
years  of  retirement  on  his  farm.  If  so,  he  was  in  for  a  big  surprise. 

Down  in  Washington  Secretary  of  State  Seward  and  the  powerful  Senator  Sumner  had 
achieved  passage  through  Congress  of  a  bill  to  purchase  Alaska  from  Russia  for  $7,000,000. 
Evidently  Capt  Bryant,  and  other  whale  men,  had  been  called  to  Washington  to  give 
testimony  before  the  bill  was  passed,  for  later  Senator  Sumner  stated  publicly:  “next 
to  myself  you  owe  it  to  Capt.  Charles  Bryant  that  we  were  successful  in  purchasing  so 
valuable  a  territory.”68  After  the  Purchase,  this  vast  new  territory  of  Alaska  was  placed 
under  the  administration  of  the  Treasury  Department,  and  an  administrator  had  to  be 
found.  Treasury  Secretary  McCulloch,  acting  on  the  recommendation  of  Senator  Sumner, 
appointed  Capt.  Bryant  as  Special  Treasury  Agent  to  govern  Alaska. 

When  Capt.  Bryant  sailed  for  Sitka  in  September,  1868,  the  task  confronting  him  was 
enormous. . . .  Bryant  sailed  to  the  Pribylofs,  he  found  complete  anarchy.  Taking  advantage 
of  the  absence  of  any  law  or  orders,  raiders  had  taken  over  and  were  slaughtering  seals  at 
a  rate  leading  to  extermination.  The  arrival  of  the  USS  Wyanda  (and  the  military  troops) 
put  an  end  to  this  and  allowed  Capt.  Bryant  time  to  survey  the  problem,  draw  up  a 
comprehensive  plan  of  action,  and  return  to  Washington  in  1869,  to  file  his  report  with  the 
Treasury  Department.  Incidentally,  by  this  time  the  first  transcontinental  railroad  had  been 
completed,  so  the  traveler  to  and  from  the  Pacific  no  longer  had  to  spend  three  or  four 
months  at  sea  nor  to  double  Cape  Horn. 

In  Washington,  Capt.  Bryant’s  report  met  with  complete  approval,  Alaska  was  made  a 
reservation  [only  the  Pribilof  Islands  were  a  reservation,  not  all  the  Alaska  Territory] 
under  the  authority  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  and  Secretary  Boutwell  placed  Capt. 
Bryant  in  charge. . . .  For  the  latter  years  of  his  stay  in  Alaska,  Capt.  Bryant’s  wife  and  niece 
journeyed  up  to  live  with  him.  The  captain  reported  that  the  last  winter  they  were  there 
was  the  coldest  for  60  years  and  the  temperature  in  February  averaged  four  degrees  above 
zero. 

After  serving  nearly  eight  years  under  three  presidents  and  seven  different  secretaries 
of  the  treasury,  Capt.  Bryant  resigned  and  with  his  wife  and  niece  returned  to  Fairhaven 
on  July  30,  1877.  Soon  thereafter  he  moved  to  Mattapoisett,  bought  the  old  Meigs  tavern 
(present  Mattapoisett  Inn)  and  lived  there  with  his  wife  and  niece  for  the  next  25  years.  He 
died  on  July  2,  1903,  aged  83.69

The  First  Three  Managers  ♦  Bryant 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

At  the  insistence  of  Professor  Louis  Agassiz  and  Benjamin  Pierce,  Superintendent  of  the 
Office  of  Coast  Survey,  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  Hugh  McCulloch  appointed  Captain 
Charles  Bryant  the  first  Special  Agent  of  the  U.S.  Treasury  assigned  to  the  Pribilof  Islands. 
Bryant’s  appointment  came  in  1868,  and  he  traveled  to  Sitka,  Alaska,  prior  to  his  arrival  at 
St.  Paul  Island  during  the  spring  of  1869.  Dr.  Hugh  H.  McIntyre  also  received  an  appoint¬ 
ment  as  agent  in  1868,  and  he  too  arrived  in  1869,  but  McIntyre  spent  little  time  on  the 
islands  (see  Hugh  McIntyre’s  biography).  Bryant’s  assignment  was  to  protect  the  interests 
of  the  Natives  on  the  islands,  who  were  allegedly  receiving  harsh  treatment  at  the  hands 
of  freebooting  sealers,  and  the  government’s  tax  revenue  interest  in  the  fur  seal.  Bryant’s 
observations  and  recommendations  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  received  significant 
credit  as  the  basis  for  legislation  leading  to  the  leasing  of  the  Pribilof  fur-seal  harvest  to  a 
private  company.70 

While  awaiting  passage  in  Sitka  to  the  Pribilofs,  Captain  Bryant  had  received  a  com¬ 
munique  (see  next  page)  from  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  McCulloch  directing  him  to 
expeditiously  proceed  to  the  Pribilofs  and  to  gather  intelligence  on  how  the  Russians  had 
conducted  business  on  the  islands.71 

Presumably,  the  Native  Chief  (Alexander  Milovidov?)  on  St.  Paul  Island  gave  the  fol¬ 
lowing  statement,  dated  September  1,  1869.  It  was  cited  as  a  translation  and  enclosed 
with  a  June  14,  1870,  report  by  Lieutenant  Winslow  B.  Barnes  of  the  U.S.  Revenue  Marine 
Service.72  Whether  the  document  was  addressed  to  Lieutenant  Barnes  or  Captain  Bryant 
is  unclear,  but  it  was  a  strong  statement  of  the  Pribilof  Aleuts’  unhappiness  with  their  new 
situation. 

Written  Statement  by  an  Unnamed  St.  Paul  Island  Native  Chief 

On  your  arrival  at  this  island  you  read  your  instructions  in  our  presence. 

Those  instructions  were  immediately  translated  to  us,  and  we  learned  from  them  that  the 
Secretary  of  the  Treasury  left  to  your  judgment  and  intrusted  [sic]  you  to  designate  the 
number  of  seals  we  can  kill  this  year. 

You  also  handed  us  a  translation  of  the  order  of  1868,  by  which  the  killing  of  seals  was 
prohibited. 

The  fulfillment  of  this  order  would  have  not  only  brought  us  to  extreme  poverty,  but  would 
have  deprived  us  of  means  of  subsistence. 

We  have  no  money  for  changing  the  place  of  our  residence,  and  the  prohibition  of  seal¬ 
killing  will  cause  our  ruin. 

You  decided  upon  a  certain  number  of  seals  to  be  taken  for  our  subsistence.  Knowing 
that  the  fixing  of  the  number  of  seals  was  left  to  you,  we  take  the  liberty  to  request  you  to 
increase  the  number  of  seals  to  be  killed  this  season,  and  beg  to  explain  hereby  the  reasons 
which  prompt  us  to  do  so. 

Twelve  cents  a  day  is  not  sufficient  for  our  food,  and  besides  food  we  want  warm  clothing 
for  the  cold  winter,  and  if  we  do  not  provide  them  our  families  will  suffer  from  the  rigor  of 
the  climate.  Our  houses  must  nearly  all  be  repaired. 

Most  of  us  have  debts  which  we  consider  it  our  duty  to  pay  before  expending  for  ourselves. 

We  have  a  church  and  a  school  which  we  support.  We  have  widows  and  orphans  who 
require  the  support  of  the  community.  Finally,  we  can  not  subsist  on  seal  meat  alone.

The  rigor  of  the  winters  and  the  discomfort  of  our  dwellings  made  us  acquire  the  habit  of 
drinking  tea,  which  warms  and  stimulates  us.  We  are  accustomed  to  this  beverage,  and  it  is 
difficult  for  us  to  dispense  with  it. 

We  request  you  to  give  due  attention  to  our  wants,  and  trust  that  you  will  perceive  the 
necessity  of  increasing  the  number  of  seals  you  have  decided  may  be  killed  in  one  year.73 

Captain  Bryant  and  his  assistant,  Agent  Hugh  H.  McIntyre,  may  have  known  of 
the  Native  Chief’s  letter  when  they  reported  to  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  Boutwell  on 
November  30,  1869,  but  they  may  not  have  seen  it  until  June  1870  when  Lt.  Barnes  re¬ 
leased  his  report.  Regardless,  Bryant’s  response  to  Secretary  McCulloch’s  earlier  instruc¬ 
tions  for  information  on  conditions  in  the  Pribilofs  Islands  did  not  agree  with  the  Native 
Chief’s  expressed  concerns.  For  example: 

Since  the  transfer  both  flour  and  bread  have  been  sent  to  the  islands  in  large  quantities,  and 
the  stores  are  well  supplied  with  necessary  articles  at  reasonable  prices,  so  that  the  people 
feel  the  change  of  government  to  have  been  to  them  a  benefit,  and  all  express  satisfaction 
with  their  present  condition.74

REPORTS  OF  CAPTAIN  CHARLES  BRYANT. 

Eatriiaven,  Mass.,  November  30, 1800. 

Sir:  Having  returned  from  Alaska,  where  I  was  ordered  as  special 
agent  of  the  Treasury  Department  in  September,  1808,  to  examine  into 
the  resources  of  the  Territory,  and  the  character  and  habits  of  its  vari¬ 
ous  tribes,  I  have  the  honor  to  submit  the  following  report: 

On  account  of  the  great  diversity  in  the  physical  features  of  the  Ter¬ 
ritory,  the  widely  varying  nature  of  the  products  of  the  different  sec¬ 
tions,  and  the  very  marked  difference  in  the  character  and  habits  of  the 
various  tribes,  I  have  deemed  it  necessary  to  describe  each  portion  of 
the  country  in  detail,  in  order  that  a  proper  idea  of  the  whole  Territory 
may  be  gained;  and  as  my  attention  was  more  particularly  called  to  the 
interests  of  the  fur-seal  trade  in  Behring’s  Sea,  I  will  begin  with  the 
islands  of  St.  Caul  and  St.  George.

ALASKA. 


TIIE  PltTBTLOV,  Oil  SEAL  ISLANDS. 

The  Pribilov  group  was  discovered  in  the  year  1785,  by  Captain  Prib- 
ilov,  who  came  from  Russia  to  take  charge  of  the  trading  post  at  Un- 
alaska.  Observing  large  numbers  of  seals  passing  north  through  the 
Aleutian  Islands  in  the  spring,  and  returning  in  the  fall,  he  conceived 
the  idea  that  some  unknown  land  to  the  northward  was  visited  by  them, 
and  accordingly  fitted  out  an  expedition  which  resulted  in  the  discovery, 
in  June,  1785,  of  the  island,  named  for  the  vessel  in  which  he  sailed, 
St.  George.  Jn  the  following  year,  in  a  clear  day,  the  people  left  on  St. 
George  saw  another  island  to  the  northward,  which,  from  the  day  of  its 
discovery,  was  named  St.  Paul. 

St.  Paul  Island  is  triangular  in  form,  sixteen  miles  long,  and  about 
four  and  one-half  miles  wide.  It  is  of  volcanic  origin,  and  consists  of 
a  cluster  of  cones  formed  by  the  cracking  of  the  earth’s  crust  and  the 
pouring  out  of  the  melted  matter  of  the  interior.  These  cones  through 
the  center  of  the  island  have  an  elevation  of  from  from  two  to  four 
thousand  feet,  and  a  diameter  at  the  base  of  from  half  a  mile  to  a  mile 
and  a  half,  while  those  along  the  shore  are  much  smaller,  having  a  diam¬ 
eter  of  one-eighth  to  one-half  a  mile  at  the  base.  These  cones  seem  to 
be  wholly  composed  of  clink-stones,  which  are  cracked  in  many  places, 
either  from  contraction  in  cooling  or  by  the  action  of  frost.  Where  the 
cones  project  into  the  water  they  form  rounded  points,  Hanked  by  a  belt 
of  loose  rocks  between  them,  and  the  water  varying  from  five  to  forty 
rods  in  width.  Between  these  points  the  shores  arc  composed  of  loose 
sand.  The  narrow  peninsula  projecting  two  and  one-half  miles  from 
the  island  in  a  southwesterly  direction,  and  forming  the  harbor  known 
as  Southwest  Bay,  was  formerly  an  island,  which  has  gradually  connected 
itself  with  the  larger  island,  to  which  it  is  attached  by  the  formation  of 
ail  immense  bank  of  fine  sand,  which  has  been  thrown  up  by  the  action 
of  the  water.  At  the  present  time,  the  small  cove  near  the  village,  and 
by  way  of  which  goods  are  lightered  to  the  store-houses,  is  slowly  filling 
up,  so  that  a  sand  bank  now  appears  where  one  year  ago  a  vessel  draw¬ 
ing  six  feet  of  water  was  lying  at  anchor. 

Near  the  center  of  the  island  one  of  the  cones  shows  the  rim  of  the 
crater  of  an  extinct  volcano  some  thirty  rods  in  diameter.  Around  its 
base  are  several  deep  fissures,  communicating  with  dark  caves.  This 
portion  of  the  island  is  composed  wholly  of  clink  stones  and  lava,  cov¬ 
ered  with  a  growth  of  moss. 

St.  George  Island  is  situated  about  forty  miles  southeast  from  St. 
Paul.  It  is  about  twelve  miles  long  by  four  miles  wide,  and  very  irreg¬ 
ular  in  shape.  Its  general  features  are  the  same  as  those  of  St.  Paul, 
except  that  the  shores  are  bolder  and  the  mountains  crossing  it  are  less 
conical.  The  island  bears  the  appearance  of  having  been  much  larger 
at  one  time,  t  he  surrounding  portions  appearing  to  have  been  again  sub¬ 
merged  after  the  upheaval,  leaving  the  shores  bold  and  prominent.  It 
is  only  on  the  sloping  shores  of  the  depressions  through  the  center  that 
the  seals  are  able  to  obtain  a  footing,  as  at  all  other  points  the  surf 
breaks  against  the  base  of  the  cliffs. 

Two  small  islands,  known  as  Walrus  and  Otter  Islands,  and  situated 
near  St.  Paul,  complete  the  Pribilov  group. 

Previous  to  my  arrival,  no  meteorological  records  had  been  kept  on 
i  he  islands.  My  own  observations  give  the  mean  temperature  of  the 
months  of  June,  July,  and  August,  respectively,  at  48°,  51°,  and  50° 
above  zero,  and  I  was  informed  that  during  the  last  winter  the  mercury 
Avas  tAvice  congealed.  Snow  falls  from  October  to  April ;  but  except  at

those  points  which  are  protected  from  the  wind,  does  not  attain  any 
great  depth.  During  the  months  of  March  and  April,  vast  masses  of 
ice,  which  have  formed  during  the  winter  in  Behring’s  Sea,  pass  to  the 
southward.  The  weather  at  this  season  is  very  severe,  the  storms  being 
long  and  violent.  But  little  fog  was  experienced  on  the  island  of  St. 
Paul  during  last  summer,  though  it  could  be  seen  a  few  miles  distant 
the  greater  part  of  the  time,  and  the  sun  was  generally  partially  obscured 
by  the  humid  atmosphere.  The  climate  docs  not  admit  of  agricultural 
pursuits,  but  there  are  at  least  one  thousand  acres  of  first  class  grazing 
land  along  the  southeast  shore  of  St.  Paul.  Last  year  a  horse  and  four 
cattle  were  placed  on  the  island  by  the  parties  doing  business  there. 
Directions  had  been  given  to  have  a  quantity  of  hay  prepared,  but  as 
the  wet  weather  prevented  this  from  being  done,  the  animals  were  forced 
to  subsist  on  the  dry  grass  of  the  marshes.  Contrary  to  the  general  ex¬ 
pectation,  the  spring  found  them  in  good  condition,  the  abundant  supply 
of  wild  rye  heads  having  proved  a  most  nutritious  food.  Sheep  and 
goats  have  been  added  to  the  stock,  during  the  present  season,  and  all 
are  doing  well.  I  have  been  thus  minute  in  description,  as  it  has  been 
asserted  that  the  islands  arc  barren  rocks,  destitute  of  vegetation. 

THE  PUR  SEAL. 

The  seals  resort  to  the  Pribilov  Islands  during  the  summer  months, 
apparently  for  the  sole  purpose  of  reproducing  their  species.  To  this 
end  each  age  or  class  contributes  its  share  of  labor  or  care,  remaining 
on  shore  or  in  the  water  as  may  be  necessary.  In  order  to  fully  under¬ 
stand  the  duties  of  the  various  classes,  a  description  of  the  animal  seems 
to  be  necessary  at  this  point. 

The  male  seal  attains  its  full  growth  at  the  age  of  six  years,  when  it 
measures  from  seven  to  eight  feet  in  length,  and  from  six  to  seven  in 
circumference.  Its  color  is  a  dark  brown  with  a  gray  over-hair  on  the 
neck  and  shoulders,  and  its  weight  is  from  six  to  twelve  hundred  pounds. 
These  alone  occupy  the  rookeries  with  the  females. 

A  full-grown  female  measures  from  four  to  five  feet  in  length  and 
three  feet  in  circumference,  and  weighs  from  one  to  three  hundred 
pounds.  It  differs  in  shape  somewhat  from  the  male,  in  having  a  shorter 
neck  and  greater  fullness  of  body  in  the  posterior  parts.  Its  color  when 
it  first  leaves  the  water  is  a  dark  “  steel-mixed”  on  the  back,  and  lighter 
about  the  breast  and  sides.  After  being  on  shore  a  few  days,  its  color 
gradually  changes  to  a  dark  brown  on  the  back  and  assumes  an  orange 
hue  on  the  breast  and  throat,  and  is,  therefore,  easily  distinguished  from 
i  'the  male.  The  female  attains  its  full  size  and  brings  forth  young  about 
the  third  or  fourth  year.  The  yearling  seals  weigh  from  forty  to  sixty 
pounds,  and  are  of  a  dark  brown  color,  with  a  lighter  shade  about  the 
throat.  The  intermediate  ages  from  one  to  six  are  readily  distinguished 
by  their  difference  in  size  and  form.  The  reproductive  organs  of  the 
male  are  developed  in  the  fourth  year  of  its  age,  but  it  has  not  yet  ac¬ 
quired  sufficient  strength  to  maintain  its  place  in  the  breeding  rookeries, 
which  are  occupied  exclusively  by  the  old  males  and  females  with  their 
pups.  These  rookeries  are  located  on  the  belt  of  loose  rock,  between 
the  liigh-water  mark  and  the  base  of  the  cliffs,  and  vary  in  width  from 
five  to  forty  rods.  The  stretches  of  sand  beach  between  the  rookeries 
are  occupied  by  the  young  seals  as  temporary  resting  places,  or  by  the 
sick  and  wounded  as  neutral  ground,  on  which  they  may  remain  undis¬ 
turbed.  The  old  males  return  each  year  to  the  same  rock  as  long  as 
they  are  able  to  maintain  their  position.  It  is  vouched  for  by  the  na-

fives  tli at  one  seal  came  for  seventeen  successive  seasons  to  the  same 
point.  The  male  seals  under  six  years  of  age  are  not  allowed  on  tlie 
breeding  rookeries,  and  they  are  generally  found  in  the  water  swimming 
along  the  shore  during  the  day,  and  at  night  on  the  uplands  above  the 
rookeries,  where  they  rest  scattered  about  like  a  flock  of  sheep.  Where 
a  long  continuous  shore  line  is  occupied  by  the  rookeries,  narrow  pas¬ 
sages  are  left  at  convenient  intervals,  through  which  the  young  seals 
may  pass  unmolested  to  and  from  the  uplands.  At  times  a  line  of  seals 
may  be  seen  for  hours  passing  in  single  tile  through  these  open  spaces. 
JT  at  any  time,  from  sudden  fright,  they  attempt  to  cross  the  rookeries  at 
any  other  point,  a  general  engagement  ensues,  resulting  in  the  killing 
anil  wounding  of  large  numbers,  and  if  the  females  with  their  pups  are 
on  the  rookeries,  many  of  the  latter  are  crushed  by  being  trampled  upon. 
Constant  care  is  necessary,  therefore,  on  the  part  ol  the  officer  in  charge, 
or  of  the  native  chiefs,  to  prevent  any  unusual  demonstration  to  alarm 
the  rookeries. 

The  special  duty  of  the  old  males,  or  wigs,  as  they  are  commonly 
called,  is  to  receive  the  females  on  their  arrival,  and  to  watch  over  and 
protect  their  young  until  large  enough  to  be  left  to  the  care  of  their 
mothers  and  the  younger  males,  or  bachelors,  as  the  latter  are  termed. 

From  the  first  to  the  middle  of  April,  when  the  snow  has  melted  from 
the  shore  and  the  drift-ice  from  the  north  ceased  running,  a  few  old  male 
seals  make  their  appearance  in  the  water  around  the  islands,  and  after 
two  or  three  days’  reconnoissance,  venture  on  shore  and  examine  the  rook¬ 
eries,  carefully  smelling  them.  If  everything  is  satisfactory  thus  far, 
after  a  day  or  two,  a  few  climb  the  slopes  and  lie  with  heads  erect  list¬ 
ening.  At  this  time,  if  the  wind  blows  in  the  direction  of  the  rookeries, 
all  fires  are  extinguished  and  all  unnecessary  noises  suppressed.  These 
scouts  soon  depart,  and  after  a  few  days  return  with  large  numbers  of 
the  male  seals  of  all  ages.  The  rookeries  are  taken  possession  of  by  the 
old  males,  who  drive  the  younger  ones  into  the  water,  or  to  the  uplands 
inside  the  rookeries.  In  locating  for  the  season,  the  old  males  each  re¬ 
serve  about  one  square  rod  of  ground  for  the  convenience  of  their  future 
families,  and  that  they  may  have  sufficient  room  in  which  to  execute 
their  awkward  movements  in  defending  themselves  against  the  attacks 
of  their  neighbors.  Male  seals  continue  to  arrive  daily  for  some  time, 
the  greater  part  of  whom  are  old  wigs,  who  fight  their  way  to  their  old 
places,  or  prepare  to  defend  some  newly  selected  ground  against  any 
former  occupant  that  may  claim  it.  They  acknowledge  no  right  save 
might,  so  that  the  quarrel  is  incessant  day  and  night,  and  the  continual 
growling  sounds  like  the  approach  of  a  distant  railroad  train. 

About  the  middle  of  June,  the  males  have  all  arrived  and  the  ground 
is  fully  occupied  by  them.  Soon  after  this  the  females  begin  to  come,  in 
small  numbers  at  first,  increasing  as  the  season  grows  later,  until  the 
middle  of  July,  when  the  rookeries  are  full  and  many  of  the  reservations 
of  the  old  males  overcrowded  with  their  respective  families.  When  the 
females  first  arrive  many  of  them  appear  desirous  of  returning  to  some 
particular  male,  and  frequently  climb  the  rocks  overlooking  the  rookeries 
and  utter  a  peculiar  cry  as  if  endeavoring  to  attract  the  attention  of  some 
acquaintance.  Changing  their  place  at  intervals,  this  cry  is  often  repeated 
until  some  bachelor  perceives  her  and  she  is  driven  to  the  rookeries 
and  quickly  appropriated.  It  seems  to  be  t  he  sole  duty  of  the  bachelors 
at  this  season  to  compel  the  females  to  take  their  places  in  the  rookeries, 
and  often  against  their  will.  When  the  female  reaches  the  shore,  the 
nearest  male  meets  and  coaxes  her  with  a  peculiar  clucking  noise  until 
he  gets  between  her  and  the  water,  when  his  tone  changes,  and,  with  a

growl  he  drives  her  to  a  place  in  his  family.  This  continues  until  the 
lower  row  begins  to  get  full,  whim  those  higher  up  from  the  shore,  watch¬ 
ing  their  opportunity  when  their  neighbor  is  off'  his  guard,  rob  his  fam¬ 
ily  to  augment  their  own.  This  they  do  by  taking  the  female  in  their 
mouths  and  carrying  her  to  their  own  ground.  Those  still  higher  up 
pursue  the  same  plan  until  all  the  space  is  occupied.  Frequently  a  strug¬ 
gle  ensues  between  two  males  for  the  same  female,  both  seizing  her  at 
once,  and  either  pulling  her  asunder  or  terribly  lacerating  her.  After 
the  ground  lias  been  covered  the  old  male  devotes  his  time  to  keeping 
order  in  his  family  and  driving  away  intruders.  Within  two  or  three 
days  after  their  arrival  the  females  give  birth  to  one  pup,  each,  which  is 
of  a  very  dark  brown  color,  and  weighs  from  six  to  twelve  pounds.  The 
mother  manifests  a  strong  attachment  for  her  young  and  distinguishes 
its  cry,  which  resembles  the  bleating  of  a  lamb,  among  thousands.  Soon 
after  the  birth  of  the  pup  the  female  receives  the  male  on  the  rocks,  but 
it  is  doubtful  whether  this  connection  is  often  perfect.  She  is  subsequently 
allowed  to  go  into  the  water,  where  she  is  followed  by  the|voung  males, 
by  whom  the  connection  is  repeated.  Upon  her  return  to  the  rookeries 
she  is  from  this  time  allowed  greater  freedom,  and  goes  at  will  from  one 
point  to  another.  By  the  middle  of  August  the  females  have  all  brought 
forth  their  young,  and  the  old  males,  who  have  constantly  occupied  their 
places  for  four  months  without  food,  resign  their  charge  to  the  bachelors 
and  go  into  the  water  for  the  apparent  purpose  of  feeding.  The  asser¬ 
tion  that  the  seals  live  so  long  without  food  seems  so  contrary  to  nature, 
that  I  will  state  that  1  took  special  pains  to  examine  daily  a  large  extent 
of  rookery  and  note  it  carefully.  The  rocks  on  the  rookeries  are  worn 
smooth  and  washed  by  the  surf,  and  any  discharge  of  excrement  could 
not  fail  to  be  seen.  1  found  in  a  few  instances  a  single  discharge  of  excre- 
mentitious  matter  on  the  arrival  of  the  seals,  but  nothing  subsequently 
to  indicate  that  any  food  is  taken  ;  nor  do  they  leave  the  rocks  at  any 
time  except  when  compelled  by  the  heat  to  seek  the  water  to  cool  them¬ 
selves. 


On  their  arrival  in  the  spring  they  are  very  fat  and  round,  but  at  the 
end  of  four  months  are  thin  and  of  little  more  than  half  their  former 
weight.  1  also  examined  the  stomachs  of  several  hundred  young  seals, 
but  was  unable  to  find  any  traces  of  food  in  them. 

The  udder  of  the  female  is  situated  about  half-way  between  the  fore 
and  hind  flippers,  and  is  furnished  with  four  teats.  The  milk  is  of  a 
yellowish  white  color,  insipid  to  the  taste,  and  is  said  to  contain  no  sugar. 
The  pups  nurse  but  seldom,  and  when  separated  from  the  mother  for 
thirty-six  hours  seem  in  no  haste  to  seek  nourishment  on  her  return. 

About  the  middle  of  July  the  great  body  of  the  last  year’s  pups  arrive 
and  occupy  the  slopes  with  the  younger  class  of  males,  while  the  young- 
females  join  the  older  ones  on  the  breeding  rookeries.  The  females  go 
into  the  water  to  feed  when  the  pups  are  some  six  weeks  old,  leaving 
them  on  the  uplands;  nor  do  the  young  seek  the  water  until  they  are 
several  months  old,  and  even  then  seldom  from  choice,  but  are  forced 
to  learn  to  swim  by  the  old  males.  About  the  last  of  October  the  seals 
begin  to  leave  the  island,  the  young  and  females  going  first,  and  the  old 
males  following  them.  By  the  first  of  December  all  have  departed.  In 
November  the  young  seals  stop  to  rest  for  a  few  days  on  the  Aleutian 
Islands,  where  several  hundred  are  annually  killed  by  the  natives. 


MANNER  OF  KILLING.

as  I  have  already  described,  a  party  of  hunters,  armed  with  clubs  of 
hard  wood,  approach  them  and  creep  quietly  between  the  rookeries  and 
the  shore,  and  at  a  given  signal  start  forward  at  once  and  drive  the 
animals  inland  in  a  body.  When  at  a  sufficient  distance  from  the  water, 
a  halt  is  made,  and  as  many  of  the  undesirable  seals  selected  out  ami 
sent  back  as  possible.  Only  those  of  the  ages  of  two  and  three  years 
are  considered  prime  skins.  The  remainder  of  the  flock  is  then  driven 
to  the  slaughter  ground,  which  is  sometimes  several  miles  distant.  It 
is  necessary  to  drive  them  inland  some  distance  in  order  that  the  smell 
of  blood  may  not  alarm  the  rookeries,  and  it  is  also  a  matter  of  conven¬ 
ience  to  have  the  seal  carry  his  own  skin  to  a  point  near  the  salt  houses; 
but  the  driving  must  be  conducted  with  the  greatest  care,  as,  when  the 
animal  is  overheated,  the  fur  loosens  and  the  skin  is  rendered  worthless. 
On  arriving  at  the  killing  ground,  a  few  boys  are  stationed  to  prevent 
them  from  straggling,  and  they  are  left  to  rest  and  cool,  after  which  a 
small  number  are  separated  from  the  flock,  surrounded,  and  driven 
closely  together,  where  they  are  confined  by  treading  on  each  other’s 
flippers.  In  this  position  the  desirable  animals  are  quickly  killed  by  a 
light  blow  on  the  nose  from  the  hunter’s  club,  and  all  others  are  allowed 
to  enter  the  water  at  the  nearest  point,  whence  they  return  to  the  spot 
from  which  they  were  driven  ;  this  is  repeated  until  the  whole  flock  has 
been  disposed  of.  In  the  skinning,  every  man  is  expected  to  contribute 
his  share  of  labor,  as  all  receive  a  portion  of  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  of 
the  skins.  As  the  seals  are  not  considered  as  being  wholly  at  rest  for 
the  season  until  the  females  arrive,  great  care  is  required  in  selecting 
the  proper  place  from  which  to  drive,  early  in  the  season,  and  this  is 
exercised  by  the  chief,  or  one  of  his  subordinate  officers,  who  has  the 
whole  direction  of  this  part  of  the  business. 

In  the  month  of  May,  only  such  small  numbers  as  arc  required  for  eat¬ 
ing  are  driven;  in  June  they  become  more  numerous,  and  are  then 
driven  for  their  skins,  although  the  percentage  of  prime  skins  in  any 
flock  is  very  small.  About  the  middle  of  July  the  females  go  from  the 
rookeries  into  the  water,  and  there  is  a  season  of  general  unrest  among 
all  classes  of  seals,  during  which,  for  a  period  of  about  ten  or  fifteen  days, 
none  are  killed. 

About  this  time  the  yearling  seals  arrive,  and  these,  together  with  a 
portion  of  the  females,  mix  with  the  young  males,  greatly  increasing  the 
difficulty  in  distinguishing  the  proper  animal  for  killing,  and  it  is  neces¬ 
sary  for  the  chief,  or  his  deputy  in  charge,  to  designate  each  seal 
to  be  slaughtered ;  only  the  strong  interest  which  the  natives  feel 
in  their  preservation  can  insure  the  proper  care  in  the  selection.  Sep¬ 
tember  and  October  are  considered  the  best  months  for  capturing  the 
seal.  In  addition  to  the  skin,  each  seal  yields  about  one  and  one-lialf 
gallons  of  oil,  and  the  lining  membrane  of  the  throat,  and  portions  of 
the  intestines,  which  latter  are  indispensable  to  the  Aleutians  at  all 
points,  being  used  in  the  manufacture  of  water-proof  clothing,  without 
which  they  could  not  venture  at  sea  in  their  skin  boats. 

It  will  be  seen  from  the  foregoing  description  of  the  habits  of  the  seal, 
that  their  preservation  and  increase  are  very  simple  matters,  the  only 
requirements  being  that  the  animals  shall  not  be  unnecessarily  disturbed 
at  any  time,  and  that,  for  killing,  the  males  only  shall  be  selected;  and 
L  will  add  that  the  increase  is  more  rapid,  when  a  portion  of  the  males 
are  killed  each  year,  since,  by  the  constant  fighting  of  this  sex,  when  in 
excess,  many  of  the  young  are  trampled  upon  and  destroyed.

MANNER,  OF  CURING  THE  SKINS. 

The  skins,  on  being  taken  to  the  salt  houses,  are  packed  in  square- 
bins  or  benches,  with  the  flesh  side  up,  on  which  a  quantity  of  salt  is 
scattered.  Here  they  are  allowed  to  remain  one  or  two  months,  when 
they  are  removed  and  folded  with  a  quantity  of  clean  salt,  and  firmly 
rolled  and  tied  for  shipment,  only  requiring  a  small  additional  quantity 
of  salt  on  being  removed  from  the  islands. 

NUMBER  OF  SEALS. 

There  are,  on  St,.  Paid  Island,  at  least  twelve  miles  of  shore  line, 
occupied  by  the  breeding  rookeries,  not  less  than  fifteen  rods  wide,  with 
an  average  of  twenty  seals  to  the  square  rod.  This  gives  the  whole 
number  of  breeding  males  and  females  at  1,152,000  ;  deducting  from  this 
number,  one-tenth,  for  males,  and  we  have  remaining  1,030,800  breeding 
females,  which  number  may,  with  care  in  killing,  be  largely  increased 
from  year  to  year,  until  the  islands  shall  ultimately  be  fully  occupied  by 
them. 

The  number  of  breeding  animals  on  St.  George  is  estimated  at  nearly 
one-lialf  as  many  as  occupy  St.  Paul.  In  addition  to  those  on  breeding 
rookeries,  we  have  the  large  number  of  young  seals,  scattered  about  at 
various  points,  and  swelling  the  total  number  of  animals  on  the  two 
islands  to  not  less  than  three  or  four  millions. 

I  will  remark  here,  that  the  peculiar,  humid  atmosphere,  and  unvary¬ 
ing  summer  temperature,  induced  by  the  meeting  of  the  warm  ocean 
currents  from  the  south  and  the  colder  ones  from  the  north,  seem  to 
render  these  islands  the  favorite  resort  of  the  seals  in  preference  to  those 
of  the  Aleutian  group. 

It  is  the  opinion  of  the  native  chiefs,  and  of  the  late  officers  of  the 
Russi an-Am erican  Company  who  have  been  stationed  on  the  seal  islands, 
that  1 00,000  skins  may  at  the  present  time  be  taken  from  both  islands 
without  diminishing  the  annual  production. 

FRICE  PAID  AND  RECEIVED  FOR  SKINS. 

The  late  Russian  company  allowed  the  natives  ten  cents  each  for  seal 
■  skins,  delivered  by  the  side  of  the  vessel  for  shipment,  which,  of  course, 
included  the  labor  of  salting,  packing,  <&c. 

The  American  traders  who  engaged  in  the  business  in  1868,  paid 
about  thirty  cents  each  for  the  skins  delivered  at  the  salt  houses,  and 
from  fifty  cents  to  one  dollar  per  day  for  all  labor  performed  in  preparing 
them  for  market.  During  the  last  season  the  sum  of  forty  cents  each  has 
been  paid  for  the  small  number,  amounting  to  about  sixteen  thousand, 
on  St.  Paul,  at  the  date  of  my  departure  from  the  island  the  last  of  Au¬ 
gust,  killed  for  the  sustenance  of  the  natives. 

London  is  the  principal  market  for  raw  seal  skins,  where  the  average 
price,  previous  to  1806,  was  about  three  dollars  per  skin,  but,  as  they 
became  fashionable  for  ladies’  wear,  in  1807  the  price  rose  to  seven  dol¬ 
lars  per  skin.  The  large  number  taken  in  1807  and  1808,  amounting  to 
about  three  hundred  thousand,  have  again  decreased  the  London  valua¬ 
tion  to  three  and  four  dollars  each. 

BUILDINGS  ON  TIIE  ISLANDS. 

The  late  Russian  company’s  buildings  are  situated  on  the  peninsula 


49 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


g  ALASKA. 

of  St.  Paul  Island,  and  comprise  three  dwelling  houses,  one  storehouse 
for  goods,  and  one  large  warehouse  for  salting  and  storing  skins.  They 
a, re  all  built  of  wood,  and  were  much  out  of  repair  when  the  transfer 
took  place.  The  parties  occupying  them  at  the  present  time  have  since 
repaired  them  at  an  expense  nearly  equal  to  their  original  cost.  Parties 
doing  business  on  the  islands  last  summer,  erected  several  new  build¬ 
ings  on  both  islands. 

The  village  of  the  natives,  grouped  about  the  company’s  buildings, 
comprises  some  forty  lints  on  St.  Paul,  and  about  half  as  many  on  St. 
George.  They  are  built  of  turf  and  thatched  with  grass.  Each  house 
has  two  or  three  apartments,  in  the  inner  one  of  which  the  family,  often 
comprising  ten  or  fifteen  persons,  live  in  a  space  seldom  exceeding  the 
dimensions  of  fifteen  feet  long  by  twelve  feet  wide,  and  six  feet  high. 
Some  of  the  houses  are  neatly  kept,  but  being  built  partly  under  ground, 
all  lack  light  and  ventilation.  There  being  no  wood  on  the  islands,  seal 
blubber  is  used  as  fuel,  the  smoke  of  which  is  very  disagreeable.  Con¬ 
siderable  lumber  has  been  distributed  amongthe  natives  during  the  past 
summer,  but  a  large  additional  quantity  is  needed  to  enable  them  to 
make  their  houses  comfortable. 

INHABITANTS. 

The  population  of  St.  Paul  comprises  248,  and  St.  George  127  na¬ 
tives  of  the  Aleutian  family.  This  includes  a  few  men  brought  from 
Kadiak  Island  last  summer,  and  who  express  their  intention  to 
return  to  their  native  place.  All  are  members  of  the  Greco-Russian 
church,  and  are  presided  over  by  a  subordinate  of  the  priest  at  Uua- 
laska.  They  carefully  observe  all  rites  and  ceremonies  of  the  church, 
which  goes  far  in  relieving  the  monotony  of  their  lives.  The  leading 
men  are  sufiieiently  educated  in  the  Russian  language  to  be  able  to  read 
and  write,  and  keep  their  accounts  of  labor  correctly.  The  marriage 
obligation  is  strictly  observed,  and  the  women  arc  modest  and  reserved 
in  their  deportment.  Under  the  Russian  company,  the  islands  were 
governed  by  agents  residing  here,  who  exercised  absolute  authority  in  the 
administration  of  the  affairs  of  the  company.  The  natives  were  held  as 
serfs,  and  allowed  no  claim  of  ownership  to  property,  or  to  any  interest 
outside  the  company.  A  chief  or  foreman  was  designated  by  the  agent, 
and  to  his  direction  all  were  expected  to  submit.  The  work  of  taking 
the  seals  is  performed  exclusively  by  the  men,  but  the  women  have  con¬ 
siderable  out-of-door  work  in  the  way  of  carrying  the  skins  to  the  store¬ 
houses,  and  bringing  fresh  water  from  a  distance  for  the  use  of  their 
families.  The  firm  of  Messrs.  Hutchinson,  Kohl  &  Co.,  composed,  in 
part,  of  the  officers  of  the  late  Russian  company,  who  came  to  the  island 
in  the  spring  following  the  transfer,  retained  in  their  service  the  former 
agents,  foremen,  and  natives,  and  continued,  as  far  as  practicable,  the 
old  system,  and  so  continue  to  do  up  to  the  present  time,  as  this  seems 
to  give  1  he  greatest  satisfaction  to  the  natives,  who  are  averse  to  changes. 

In  the  summer  of  18G8,  the  natives,  observing  that  too  large  a  number 
of  seals  were  being  killed,  and  being  fearful  that  migration  would  result, 
applied  to  their  former  officers  for  assistance,  who  informed  them  that 
their  power  had  ceased,  and  that  they  were  subjects  of  a  government 
where  the  people  regulated  their  own  affairs.  This  suggestion  they 
acted  upon,  and  proceeded  to  elect  a  chief  and  council  of  two,  as  the 
former  objected  to  taking  the  responsibility  of  government  unaided. 
These  officers  control  their  communities  in  all  ordinary  matters,  but  the 
voice  of  the  people  is  heard  on  all  important  questions.  Following  this

election,  the  men  organized  in  classes,  according  to  their  respective  worth 
and  ability.  On  St.  Paul  Island,  the  first  class  comprised  twenty-one 
men,  who  were  acknowledged  to  be  the  best  workmen,  and  of  the  best 
moral  standing ;  the  second  class,  of  sixteen,  comprising  those  less  willing 
to  work,  and  the  third  class  of  six  men,  made  up  of  the  idle  and  vicious. 
All  are  obliged  to  work  in  taking  seals,  and  the  proceeds  of  their  labor 
constitutes  a  public  fund,  out  of  which  the  priest  is  paid  $130  per  annum, 
and  the  chiefs  $40  each  for  extra  services,  and  the  remainder  is  divided 
pro  rata  among  the  different  classes,  after  appropriating  for  those  who 
arc  unable  to  work.  This  system  has  worked  harmoniously  thus  far,  and 
the  only  criminal  offense  recorded  is  that  of  drunkenness  and  abuse  of 
family,  for  which  the  offender  was  confined  in  the  salt-house  for  two 
days  ;  since  which  he  has  given  no  trouble.  Theft  and  all  petty  crimes 
are  unknown.  I  have  been  thus  minute  in  detail,  in  order  that  it  may 
he  understood  that  the  natives  of  the  islands,  under  a  proper  officer,  are 
able  to  defend  the  interests  of  the  government  with  little  expense. 


FOOT)  OF  THE  INHABITANTS. 


The  principal  food  of  the  islands  is  seal  meat,  from  the  recently  killed 
animals,  in  summer,  and  in  winter,  from  I  he  frozen  carcasses  of  those  killed 
very  late  in  the  season,  and  preserved  for  future  use.  After  removing 
the  skin  of  the  seal,  the  blubber,  from  one  to  four  inches  thick,  and 
completely  enveloping  the  carcass,  is  taken  off,  and  the  muscle  remains 
without  any  undue  intermixture  of  fatty  matters. 

The  flesh  of  the  yearling  seal  is  somewhat  darker  than  beef  when  raw, 
and  nearly  black  when  cooked.  It  is  juicy  and  tender,  but  lacks 
the  firmness  and  sweet  flavor  of  beef;  in  highly  seasoned  dishes  it  is 
relished  by  all ;  the  soldiers  preferred  it  to  salt,  rations  at  all  times.  A 
five  weeks’  old  pup,  roasted,  is  esteemed  a.  great  luxury.  The  meat  of  the 
sea-lion,  which  is  taken  in  small  numbers,  is  considered  superior  to  that 
of  the  seal.  Halibut  may  be  caught  in  large  numbers  a  few  miles  from 
the  islands,  and  small  waterfowls  and  snipe  are  obtainable  in  their  sea¬ 
son.  Breadstuff's  were  formerly  supplied  in  limited  quantities  by  the 
Russians,  chiefly  in  the  form  of  rye,  unground,  and  which  the  natives 
were  obliged  to  prepare  as  best  they  might  with  the  limited  facilities  at 
hand.  Since  the  transfer  both  flour  and  bread  have  been  sent  to  the 
islands  in  large  quantities,  and  the  stores  arc  well  supplied  with  all 
necessary  articles  at  reasonable  prices,  so  that  the  people  feel  the  change 
of  government  to  have  been  to  them  a  benefit,  and  all  express  satisfac¬ 
tion  with  their  present  condition. 

It  will  be  seen  from  the  foregoing  remarks  concerning  the  preserva¬ 
tion  of  the  seal,  and  of  the  requirements  of  the  natives,  that  one  is  de¬ 
pendent  on  the  other ;  that  is,  the  seals  can  be  preserved  only  by  placing 
it  in  the  interests  of  the  natives  to  guard  them  as  the  source  whence 
their  support  is  to  be  derived,  while  it  is  evident  on  the  other  hand  that, 
if  deprived  of  the  benefits  of  the  seal  fisheries,  they  would  have  no  means 
of  subsistence.  I  believe  that  nothing  less  than  the  interests  of  some 
parties  in  the  seal  trade  will  serve  to  protect  the  simple-minded  natives 
in  their  rights  without  incurring  great  expense  to  the  government,  and 
I  am  of  opinion,  therefore,  that  the  best  method  of  securing  the  desired 
object  is  to  give  to  one  responsible  company  the  right  of  purchasing  on 
the  islands,  at  proper  prices,  according  to  their  market  value,  a  stated 
number  of  skins — say,  for  the  present,  100,000  annually — in  return  for 
which  privilege  said  company  shall  give  security  for  the  payment  of  a 
proper  tax  to  the  government,  and  to  provide  for  the  natives  by  the  sale 
of  goods  at  reasonable  fixed  prices,  or  by  the  gratuitous  distribution  of

supplies  when  ncecssary,  and  also  to  care  for  the  sick,  and  maintain 
schools  on  the  islands  for  the  education  of  the  children. 

THE  SEA-LION. 

Along-  with  the  fur-seal  the  sea-lion  is  found  in  considerable  numbers 
on  the  Pribilov  Islands.  It  is  the  largest  of  the  seal  family,  and  fre¬ 
quently  measures  thirteen  feet  in  length,  and  weighs  from  fifteen  hun¬ 
dred  to  two  thousand  pounds.  Its  habits  arc  similar  to  those  of  the  fur- 
seal.  It  is  covered  with  a  thick  growth  of  light  brown  hair,  without  fur,  but 
the  skin  is  of  considerable  value  as  an  article  of  commerce  in  the  western 
part  of  the  Territory,  being  used  by  the  natives  to  cover  their  boats.  All 
the  Aleutian  Islands,  and  a  large  extent  of  the  mainland  coast,  are  de¬ 
pendent  on  the  Pribilov  group  for  their  supply  of  skins  for  this  purpose. 

The  principal  sea-lion  rookery  is  on  the  north  end  of  St.  Paul  Island, 
whence  the  animals  must  be  driven  ten  or  twelve  miles  to  bring  their 
skins  to  the  drying-frames,  where  they  are  prepared  for  market.  The 
animal  is  much  more  powerful  and  savage  than  the  fur-seal,  and  the 
hunters  are  frequently  seriously  injured  in  capturing  it.  In  killing  the 
larger  animals  it  is  necessary  to  use  the  rifle,  as  it  would  be  dangerous 
to  approach  them  with  the  ordinary  seal-club.  Their  flesh  is  preferred 
to  that  of  the  seal  as  an  article  of  food,  and  nearly  every  part  of  the  an¬ 
imal  is  made  use  of  in  the  manufacture  of  the  various  articles  necessary 
to  sea-otter  hunting.  Prom  one  to  two  thousand  sea-lions  are  taken  an¬ 
nually. 


In  1870,  the  Treasury  Department  appointed  Captain  Bryant  as  agent  to  oversee  the 
beginning  of  the  fur-seal  fishery  operation,  which  effectively  began  in  1871  under  a  twen¬ 
ty-year  lease  granted  by  the  United  States  to  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company. 

Bryant’s  annual  report,  dated  July  14,  1870,  stated  in  part: 

Sir:  In  compliance  with  the  instructions  of  the  Department  of  May  24,  1870,  ordering 
me  to  take  charge  of  the  sealing  islands  and  to  provide  for  the  immediate  wants  of  the 
inhabitants,  if  found  in  a  condition  of  necessity,  I  called  on  the  chiefs  at  each  island  to  give 
me  a  statement  of  the  actual  wants  of  the  population. 

From  the  information  so  obtained  and  from  the  absence  of  provisions  in  the  stores  of 
Hutchinson,  Kohl  &  Co.  and  William  &  Havens,  it  became  apparent  that  measures  should 
be  taken  for  supplying  from  such  stores  as  were  put  on  board  the  revenue  steamer  Lincoln 
in  prevision  of  that  emergency.  I  therefore  requested  the  commander  of  the  Lincoln  to  land 
on  the  islands  all  the  bread  and  flour  which  might  be  possibly  spared  from  his  vessel  as  well 
as  the  items  specially  ordered. . . . 

I  am  happy  to  report  that  thus  far  the  conditions  have  been  fully  complied  with.  The  store 
has  been  well  stocked  with  goods  of  good  quality  and  sold  at  low  prices.75 

According  to  Bryant’s  May  19,  1871  report,  island  conditions  had  improved  remark¬ 
ably.76 

It  appears  that  no  other  agent’s  Pribilof  experiences  have  been  written  about  more 
than  those  of  Bryant’s,  excepting  Henry  Wood  Elliott’s.  Elliott  served  under  Captain 
Bryant  during  1872-1873,  and  he  is  often  credited  with  saving  the  northern  fur  seal  from 
extinction.  Elliott  often  criticized  Bryant’s  management  style  and  his  seemingly  poor  un-

derstanding  of  the  seals’  natural  history  (see  Henry  Elliott  biography).  In  1873,  William 
Dali  countered  Elliot’s  criticisms  about  Bryant.  Excerpts  of  Dali’s  letter  follow: 

Nov.  14, 1873 

My  dear  Prof.  [Spencer  Baird] 

I  have  hurried  writing  to  you  on  account  of  a  matter  which  has  just  come  to  my  knowledge 
and  which  if  it  be  not  checked  may  lead  to  incalculable  mischief  and  injury  to  the 
Government.  I  hear  Henry  Elliott  has  preferred  charges  against  Capt.  Bryant  with  a  view  to 
having  him  ousted.  I  do  not  know  the  specific  nature  of  the  charges.  But  I  do  know  and  will 
vouch  for  the  following  facts. 

Bryant  is  a  perfectly  honest  man.  This  I  will  stake  my  existence  upon.  If  it  had  been 
otherwise,  I  have  frequently  heard  members  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  say,  “The 
damned  old  fool  might  have  been  rich  long  ago.” 

Nevertheless  he  may  have,  and  I  think,  has  been  guilty  of  some  indiscretions  the  main 
ones  being  that  he  has  allowed  the  prince  of  scoundrels  Dr.  McIntyre  to  persuade  him  into 
appointing  unworthy  men  as  deputies,  notably  Falconer,  (who  is  a  great  friend  of  Elliott’s) 
and  who  was  a  defaulter  in  his  accounts  when  in  the  Government  service  at  Sitka,  and  I 
have  been  told  escaped  there  by  bribing  the  inspector.  Falconer  is  and  has  been  in  the  pay 
of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company. 

I  understand  that  Bryant  was  also  persuaded  to  allow  the  killing  of  about  1000  seals  more 
than  the  law  allows  but  this  rests  upon  the  authority  of  members  of  that  company  and  the 
reason  given  was  that  a  certain  number  of  skins  had  been  spoiled  out  of  the  legal  number. 
Nevertheless,  whatever  mistake  in  judgment  may  have  been  made  by  him  I  am  persuaded 
that  no  very  serious  injury  to  the  interests  of  the  Government  can  happen  while  Bryant  is 
there. 

Elliott  has  been  made  a  complete  fool  of  by  playing  upon  his  vanity,  and  is  doubtless 
perfectly  honest  in  his  statements. 

I  understood  that  a  strong  effort  will  be  made  this  winter  to  replace  Bryant  by  Falconer 
whose  character  has  already  been  alluded  to  or  by  the  son  of  Senator  Morton.  The  latter

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


ON  THE  FUR  SEAL  ISLANDS. 


BY  THE  FIRST  SPECIAL  TREASURY  AGENT. 


ORTLY  after  the  cession 
of  Russian  America  to  the 
United  States,  the  latter 
government  began  to  take 
active  measures  for  the 
protection  of  the  few 
fisheries  of  the  islands  of 
the  ceded  territory,  and 
thus  it  happened  that  I,  as  one  who  had  had 
eighteen  years’  experience  as  a  whaler  in  the 
North  Pacific,  became  a  factor  in  the  plans 
for  protection.  My  knowledge  of  the  natural 
history,  conditions  of  life,  and  currents  of  the 
North  Pacific  had  brought  me  into  communi¬ 
cation  with  Professor  Louis  Agassiz  and  with 
Professor  Benjamin  Peirce,  who  was  at  the  time 
Superintendent  of  the  Coast  Survey,  and  at 
their  instance  I  was  appointed  by  Hon.  Hugh 
McCulloch,  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  first 
to  report  on  the  fur-seal  fisheries  and  then  to 
organize  a  system  by  which  the  interest  of  the 
islanders  could  be  guarded  and  the  seals  pro¬ 
tected  against  unnecessary  destruction.  The 
system  established  by  me  is  still  in  active  force. 
I  reached  the  Fur  Seal,  or  Pribyloff,  Islands 
early  in  March,  1869,  but  it  was  not  until  the 
spring  of  1871  that  order  was  finally  brought 
out  of  the  confusion  into  which  the  fisheries  had 
been  thrown  by  the  change  in  ownership,  and 
we  began  operations  under  the  lease  granted  to 
the  Alaska  Commercial  Company.  I  had  found 
the  natives  disorganized  and  terrified  concern¬ 
ing  their  future,  as  the  irregularities  practiced 
by  the  various  parties  who  had  raided  the  isl¬ 
ands  for  seals  in  the  previous  year  had  threat¬ 
ened  extermination  both  to  islanders  and  to 
seals ;  and  the  plan  of  fishing  finally  adopted 
was  grafted  on  the  general  method  which  the 
Russians  had  observed,  and  in  which  the  na¬ 
tives,  who  knew  it,  would  therefore  be  likely 
to*have  confidence. 

The  Russians  had  maintained  a  head  agent 
on  the  islands,  with  whom  had  been  associated 
two  creole  subordinates  who  had  been  suffi¬ 
ciently  educated  in  the  counting-houses  of  Sitka 
to  keep  the  accounts  with  the  natives  and  to 
direct  them  in  killing  the  seals  and  preparing 
the  skins.  A  certain  sum  was  allowed  the  isl¬ 
anders  for  compensation.  The  head  agent 
employed  three  or  four  of  the  most  capable 
men  to  direct  parties  at  work,  and  the  driving 
and  killing  of  the  seals  had  been  left  mainly  to 
these.  Their  method  had  been  to  drive  the 


seals  as  near  as  possible  to  the  salting-houses, 
in  order  that  the  labor  of  carrying  the  skins 
might  be  made  as  light  as  possible ;  and  they 
had  become  sufficiently  expert  in  their  work 
to  understand  that  by  killing  the  smaller  seals 
the  work  would  be  lighter,  though  no  discrimi¬ 
nation  was  made  as  to  the  quality  of  the  skins 
in  the  animals  killed.  The  number  of  skins 
taken  annually  had  varied  from  forty  thousand 
to  sixty  thousand. 

That  the  Government  agent  in  charge  of  the 
islands  might  have  full  power  to  enforce  and 
supervise  all  operations,  it  seemed  best  to  leave 
to  some  responsible  company  the  right  to  take 
a  stated  number  of  seals  under  restrictions  and 
regulations  that  would  best  subserve  the  in¬ 
terests  of  the  United  States  and  of  the  natives 
themselves,  who  were  to  have  the  exclusive 
right  to  kill  the  seals  and  salt  the  skins. 

When  the  sealing  began  in  the  spring  of  1871, 
itsoon  became  evident  that  the  clumsy  methods 
in  vogue  were  open  to  very  great  improvement. 
To  take  the  necessary  number  of  seals  to  fill 
out  the  annual  catch,  the  whole  working  force 
of  the  islands  was  kept  busy  from  the  1st  of 
June  until  September,  the  women' helping,  par¬ 
ticularly  in  carrying  the  skins  to  the  salting- 
houses.  These  had  been  built  too  far  from  the 
landing,  and  as  soon  as  possible  they  were 
moved  nearer  to  the  beach,  in  order  to  facili¬ 
tate  the  transfer  of  the  skins  to  the  boats  on 
shipping.  As  the  skins  prepared  for  shipment, 
and  all  the  salt  necessary  for  curing  them,  had 
to  be  carried  on  the  backs  of  the  natives  across 
a  broad  beach  of  soft  sand  and  through  the 
shallow  water  to  and  from  boats,  a  railway  of 
light  iron  rails  was  eventually  built,  to  be  laid 
in  movable  sections,  with  high-wheeled  flat¬ 
cars.  Mules,  carts,  and  harnesses  were  brought 
to  the  islands,  and  whenever  the  skins  were 
to  be  carried  to  the  salting-houses  from  the 
slaughter-grounds  the  boys  and  girls,  for  the 
sake  of  the  ride  back  in  the  empty  carts,  were 
ready  to  load  them.  This  relieved  the  women 
of  the  necessity  of  all  outdoor  work  in  sealing 
time,  except  occasional  journeys  for  the  nec¬ 
essary  supply  of  seal  flesh  for  food.  Later, 
when  we  had  taught  them  to  make  bread 
and  had  introduced  various  articles  of  food,  seal 
flesh  and  blubber,  which  had  been  formerly  al¬ 
most  the  sole  means  of  sustenance,  were  used 
much  less  frequently.  Under  the  lease  held  by 
the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  the  number

ON  THE  FUR  SEAL  ISLANDS. 


of  seals  to  be  killed  annually  was  limited  to 
100,000;  and  at  40  cents  a  skin,  the  sum  allowed 
the  natives  for  each  skin  brought  in,  $40,000 
was  annually  divided  among  the  islanders  em¬ 
ployed  in  the  killing  of  seals.  We  learned  when 
the  returns  for  the  first  season’s  catch  were 
made  that  the  skins  were  assorted  into  four¬ 
teen  or  fifteen  classes.  A  small  number — less 
than  ten  per  cent. — ranked  as  first-class,  at 
$14  a  skin  ;  about  the  same  per  cent,  fell  to 
less  than  $2.50  each,  while  the  general  average 
was  about  $5.87.  This  discrepancy  in  the  value 
of  the  skins  called  attention  at  once  to  the  ques¬ 
tion  of  what  constituted  the  difference  in  quality 
between  a  skin  worth  $14  and  one  worth  only 
$2.50.  An  agent  of  the  Company  was  sent  to 
London  to  examine  the  skins  as  they  were 
classified  for  the  market :  the  result  of  his  ex¬ 
amination  revealed  the  fact  that  the  fur  of  a 
seal  was  most  valuable  when  the  animal  was 
three  years  old,  the  proportion  being  that  at 
present  prices  a  two-year-old  seal  would  be 
worth  $15  or  $16,  a  three-year-old  $16  or 
$19,  a  four-year-old  $16,  and  a  five-year-old 
only  $2.50.  As  the  agent  had  the  opportunity 
of  selecting  the  animals  before  killing,  he  aimed 
to  take  as  many  three-year-old  seals  as  possible, 
making  out  the  one  hundred  thousand  from 
those  two  or  four  years  old.  This  trebled  the 
value  of  the  annual  catch  at  once.  Again,  it 
being  desirable  to  secure  the  quantity  with  the 
least  possible  loss  of  life,  a  careful  supervision 
of  the  manner  of  driving  the  seals  to  the 
slaughter-ground  was  instituted.  Very  fat  seals 
often  become  overheated  in  driving,  and  die 
from  convulsions,  rendering  their  fur  valueless 
for  the  market.  In  consequence  of  this  diffi¬ 
culty  each  driver  is  required  to  carry  a  club 
and  a  knife,  that  any  seal  showing  indications 
of  an  overheated  condition  may  be  killed  im¬ 
mediately  and  skinned.  These  skins  are  col¬ 
lected  after  the  herd  is  cared  for,  and  are 
usually  equal  to  eight  or  ten  per  cent,  of  the 
whole  drive. 

The  cost  of  maintaining  these  fisheries  is 
about  $10,000  a  year;  the  revenue  obtained 
during  the  twenty  years  that  the  present  lease 
has  been  running  amounts  to  $365,000  a  year. 
A  careful  count  is  made  of  the  number  of  skins 
taken,  each  party  through  whose  hands  they 
pass  keeping  its  own  account.  First  they  are 
counted  by  the  chiefs,  that  the  natives  may  be 
paid  a  proper  sum ;  the  Treasury  officer  in 
charge  of  the  islands  counts  them  when  they 
are  taken  from  the  salting-houses  for  shipment; 
when  received  at  the  side  of  the  vessel  they 
are  counted  by  the  executive  officer  for  his 
bills  of  lading;  at  San  Francisco  a  revenue 
officer  takes  charge  of  them  and  has  them 
counted ;  they  are  counted  again  at  the  ware¬ 
house  in  San  Francisco,  Avhere  they  are  packed 


9  °3 

in  one-hundred-gallon  tierces  and  shipped  to 
New  York,  and  thence  to  London,  where  they 
are  counted  twice  again  before  they  are  ready 
for  sale.  An  important  element  in  the  economy 
of  the  business  is  that,  by  reason  of  the  many 
improved  methods  used  in  capturing  and 
handling  the  seals,  the  time  required  for  this 
work  has  been  materially  shortened.  Formerly 
the  work  was  continued  from  the  1st  of  June 
until  September,  but  now  the  whole  time  re¬ 
quired  for  taking  the  one  hundred  thousand 
skins  and  shipping  them  has  been  shortened  to 
forty-five  days.  This  gain  in  time  also  increases 
the  value  of  the  skins,  as  the  fur  is  far  brighter 
when  the  seals  first  land. 

The  present  lease  to  the  Alaska  Commercial 
Company  expires  July  1,  1890.  When  the  lease 
was  granted,  in  1870,  the  bids  were  governed 
by  the  average  price  of  sealskins  in  London, 
which  had  never  exceeded  $6.  Under  the 
terms  of  the  lease  the  Company  paid  the  Gov¬ 
ernment  an  average  price  of  $3.65  per  skin.  If 
the  business  was  profitable  at  that  rate,  the 
Government  should  now  obtain  a  much  larger 
share,  in  consideration  of  the  trebled  value  of 
the  skins  in  the  London  market  at  the  present 
rime.  As  there  should  be  a  large  increase  in  the 
number  of  seals  now  available,  owing  to  the 
improved  methods  of  killing  which  reserve  all 
the  females,  a  far  larger  number  might  now 
be  killed  annually — perhaps  twice  as  many. 
The  seals  occupy  as  breeding- grounds  about 
eight  miles  of  coast-line,  and  at  the  beginning 
of  my  stay  on  the  islands  I  estimated  the  num¬ 
ber  of  breeding  females  to  be  fully  1,130,000. 
When  I  left,  eight  years  later,  a  similar  method 
of  computation  gave  1,800,000  breeding  fe¬ 
males  on  the  ground. 

The  males  come  to  the  islands  the  1st  of 
May  and  remain  until  about  the  20th  of  July, 
when  they  scatter  slowly,  although  a  large 
number  of  them  remain  as  late  as  Novem¬ 
ber.  The  males  appear  on  the  ground  first, 
and  soon  after  their  arrival  they  begin  to 
locate  about  a  rod  apart,  forming  a  line  the 
entire  length  of  the  shore.  The  younger  and 
weaker  males,  beaten  back  by  the  stronger, 
coast  along,  entering  the  bays,  and  haul  up  on  -« 
the  hillsides  and  in  the  valleys.  The  greatest 
number  at  any  one  time  upon  St.  Paul,  the 
largest  of  the  islands,  is  on  the  20th  of  July, 
when  we  have  estimated  the  number  to  be  five 
millions.  The  seals  really  walk  on  four  legs, 
raising  their  bodies  from  the  ground  as  they 
move.  Under  favorable  conditions  they  travel 
about  a  mile  and  a  half  an  hour,  and  the  long¬ 
est  drive  we  ever  made  was  eight  miles.  As 
England  alone  has  the  necessary  skilled  labor 
for  preparing  the  skins  for  final  sale,  she  re¬ 
ceives  an  amount  of  profit  from  the  fur-seal 
fisheries  equal  to  the  whole  profit  of  the  United

States  in  the  islands,  and  she  therefore  is 
equally  interested  in  the  question  of  wanton 
destruction  of  the  seals.  Under  such  circum¬ 
stances  an  international  agreement  for  the  pro¬ 
tection  and  regulation  of  the  trade  ought  not 
to  be  difficult  to  obtain. 

The  Fur  Seal  Islands  lie  nearly  in  the  middle 
of  Behring’s  Sea,  the  nearest  mainland  being 
three  hundred  miles  away  to  the  north.  When 
discovered  in  1789  they  were  uninhabited,  al¬ 
though  traces  of  firebrands  gave  proof  of  earlier 
visitors.  The  islands  are  four  in  number  — 
St.  Paul,  St.  George,  Otter,  and  Walrus,  the 
former  being  the  largest,  though  but  fifteen 
miles  long.  It  is  triangular  in  shape,  and  fur¬ 
nishes  ninety  per  cent,  of  the  whole  number 
of  seals.  The  average  mean  temperature  for 
the  year  is  about  the  same  as  that  of  New 
England,  though  it  is  cooler  in  summer  and 
warmer  in  winter.  The  islands  are  of  volcanic 
origin,  but  around  the  shores  accumulations 
of  marine  sand  have  been  washed  up  by  the 
sea,  which  high  winds  have  driven  over  the 
rocky  surface,  forming  a  light  soil.  The  moist 
climate  has  clothed  this  with  a  thick  vegeta¬ 
tion,  and  in  the  valleys  and  lower  plains  a 
wild  grass  resembling  rye  abounds,  which  fur¬ 
nishes  excellent  feed  for  horses  and  sheep.  On 
the  hillsides  great  masses  of  purple  lupine  grow, 
and  a  thick  moss-like  plant  is  found,  which 
bears  a  delicious  berry,  and  is  much  used  for 
making  wine  as  well  as  for  cooking  purposes. 

On  the  whole  group  of  Aleutian  Islands 
there  were  8000  people,  and  on  the  Fur  Seal 
Islands  about  400.  A  few  of  the  men  from  the 
latter  had  been  to  Sitka  on  Russian  vessels, 
and  two  or  three  had  been  taught  enough  of 
the  Russian  language  to  allow  them  to  act  as 
clerks  in  keeping  accounts  with  the  natives, 
but  the  great  body  of  the  people  had  never 
been  from  home.  They  had  no  money,  and 
trade  was  chiefly  a  barter.  The  houses  were 
merely  turf  huts,  half  underground,  and  the 
only  fuel  was  seal  blubber,  and  seal  flesh  and 
blubber  almost  the  only  food.  For  lighting 
their  huts  they  also  used  seal  oil,  in  small  dishes 
with  floating  wicks,  and  of  course  the  ceilings 
*  were  always  sooty.  The  necessity  for  improved 
habitations  was  evident,  and  later  when  the  seal¬ 
ing  company  holding  the  lease  offered  to  build 
houses  and  permit  the  natives  to  live  in  them 
free  of  rent,  no  time  was  lost  in  accepting  the 
generous  proposal.  Before  I  left  St.  Paul  there 
had  been  built  small  cottages  of  three  rooms 
sufficient  to  house  every  family  on  the  island. 
The  people  were  so  convinced  of  the  necessity 
of  keeping  their  habitations  underground  for 
warmth  that  at  first  we  could  not  convince 
them  that  houses  could  be  made  comfortable 
in  any  other  way.  We  passed  through  various 
stages  of  unsatisfactory  yieldings  to  this  preju¬ 


dice,  but  our  last  houses  were  the  best,  and  were 
built  on  high  ground,  uncompromisingly  above 
the  earth.  A  skillful  mechanic  was  brought  out 
by  the  sealing  company,  and  under  his  guid¬ 
ance  the  natives  soon  became  sufficiently  ex¬ 
pert  to  assist  very  materially  in  building.  After 
a  row  of  foundations,  the  length  of  the  street, 
had  been  made  ready,  the  people  were  divided 
into  three  gangs,  who  were  soon  able  to  put  up 
one  of  these  houses  and  finish  it  in  a  day.  One 
gang  laid  the  sills  and  floors,  another  set  up 
the  frame  and  boarded  the  house  laid  the 
day  before,  and  the  third  shingled  the  roof  and 
clapboarded  the  walls  of  the  one  framed  two 
days  before.  We  introduced  furniture  as  quick¬ 
ly  as  possible,  and  it  was  not  long  before  the 
islanders  were  as  comfortably  situated  as  are  the 
average  employees  in  any  manufacturing  com¬ 
munity. 

It  was  interesting  to  note  the  difference  in 
character  crop  out  as  the  community  gradually 
took  upon  itself  civilization.  Some  were  natu¬ 
rally  prudent,  and  easily  saved  a  surplus; 
others  would  be  in  debt  at  the  end  of  the  year. 
In  1877  a  small  proportion  of  their  number, 
perhaps  ten  per  cent.,  had  invested  about  ten 
or  twelve  hundred  dollars  with  the  Fur  Com¬ 
pany;  another  ten  per  cent,  were  always  in 
want;  the  remainder  spent  what  they  received. 
The  best  paid  class,  the  ablest  workers,  received 
over  four  hundred  dollars  each  for  their  sea¬ 
son’s  work,  and  as  they  could  obtain  a  large 
part  of  their  food  from  the  resources  of  the  isl¬ 
and  without  cost,  and  received  their  houses 
furnished,  rent  free,  their  needs  were  few.  To 
foreign  ways  in  clothes  and  fashion  they  in¬ 
clined  very  naturally.  The  year  before  my 
coming  sealing-parties  had  brought  to  the 
island  considerable  quantities  of  ready-made 
clothing  as  an  article  of  trade,  and  the  men 
were  consequently  fairly  well  dressed ;  but  only 
a  small  quantity  of  cloth  suitable  for  dresses 
had  been  taken,  and  the  women  had  not  be¬ 
gun  to  make  their  clothing  in  any  regular  form. 
But  in  time,  with  some  assistance,  their  ready 
adaptability  made  them  a  very  well-dressed 
people.  Before  I  came  away  the  wives  of  those 
who  had  been  saving  sent  their  measures  to 
Sitka  with  orders  for  silk  dresses  for  church 
wear,  and  the  young  men  arrayed  themselves 
in  broadcloth,  wore  gloves  and  well-blacked 
boots,  and  carried  perfumed  handkerchiefs. 

As  my  time  was  not  fully  taken  up  with  my 
duties,  and  good  fortune  brought  to  me  an 
abiding  place  of  unusual  size  for  St.  Paul,  I 
seized  the  happy  chance  of  making  my  house 
a  meeting-place  for  the  people,  and  especially 
for  the  children.  Later  we  fitted  up  a  school¬ 
room,  which  we  also  made  a  place  for  social 
entertainment,  and  kept  the  school  open  eight 
months  in  the  year.  We  were  greatly  assisted

in  our  school  duties  by  illustrated  books  and 
papers  sent  to  us ;  for  so  unvaried  and  barren 
was  the  scenery  of  the  island,  which  was  all 
of  the  world  these  children  had  ever  seen,  that 
it  was  well-nigh  impossible  for  them  to  com¬ 
prehend  physical  objects  of  the  simplest  nature. 
What  a  mountain  might  be  was  beyond  their 
understanding,  and  the  difficulty  of  explaining 
the  appearance  of  a  great  forest  to  children 
who  knew  no  vegetable  growth  larger  than  the 
purple  lupine  on  their  gentle  slopes  was  greater 
than  one  can  tell.  It  was  necessary,  however,  to 
exercise  the  strictest  censorship  in  our  illustrated 
lessons,  as  it  was  difficult  for  all  to  comprehend 
caricature  even  in  its  simplest  forms ;  even  the 
most  impossible  pictures  they  believed  repre¬ 
sented  facts. 

I  found  the  people  living  in  separate  fami¬ 
lies,  and,  as  far  as  I  could  see,  there  was  no 
more  immorality  among  them  than  would  be 


found  in  any  decent  civilized  community.  The 
women  were  modest  in  deportment,  the  chil¬ 
dren  obedient  and  respectful  to  their  parents, 
and  the  men  always  manifested  a  disposition 
to  assist  me  in  all  my  efforts. 

In  character  they  were  mild  and  gentle,  with 
the  expression  of  settled  melancholy  habitual 
to  those  races  which  have  no  amusements.  In 
this  respect,  however,  they  changed  greatly  as 
opportunity  developed  the  merriment  latent 
in  their  nature.  The  children  when  first  taught 
to  speak  did  so  in  a  serious  way,  and  the  utter 
absence  of  anything  like  hearty  laughter  in  a 
group  of  them  always  affected  me  strangely. 
It  seemed  as  if  their  avenues  of  expression 
were  closed  to  pleasure,  and  later,  when  they 
had  learned  the  simple  games  I  taught  them, 
it  was  a  great  satisfaction  to  me  to  hear  my 
rooms  ring  with  their  merry  voices.

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Captain  Bryant  deposed  for  the  Fur-Seal  Arbitration  on  April  16,  1892,  before  Notary 
Public  Sevellon  A.  Brown  at  Washington,  D.C. 

I  am  a  resident  of  Mattapoisett,  Plymouth  County,  State  of  Massachusetts,  and  am  72 
years  of  age.  In  September,  1868, 1  was  appointed  a  special  Treasury  agent  to  go  to  Pribilof 
Islands  for  the  purpose  of  investigating  and  reporting  as  to  the  habits  of  the  fur  seal,  the 
condition  of  the  islands,  and  the  most  advantageous  plan  to  be  adopted  for  the  government 
and  management  of  the  same.  Pursuant  to  such  appointment,  I  proceeded  to  the  Pacific 
coast,  and  in  March  1869  I  landed  on  St.  Paul  Island,  remaining  there  until  September 
of  the  same  year.  I  then  returned  to  Washington  and  laid  my  report  before  the  Treasury 
Department.  I  again  went  back  to  the  islands  in  July,  1870,  and  remained  there  until  the 
fall  of  1871.  Then,  in  April,  1872, 1  again  arrived  at  the  islands,  this  time  in  the  capacity  of 
a  special  agent  of  the  Treasury  Department  in  charge  of  the  seal  islands.  I  was  upon  the 
islands  as  such  agent  from  that  time  and  during  the  sealing  season  from  1872  to  1877. 

When  I  first  visited  the  seal  islands  in  1868  [1869?]  the  natives  were  living  in  semi¬ 
subterranean  houses  built  of  turf  and  such  pieces  of  driftwood  and  whalebones  as  they 
were  able  to  secure  on  the  beach.  Their  food  had  been  prior  to  that  time  insufficient  in 
variety,  and  was  comprised  of  seal  meat  and  a  few  other  articles,  furnished  in  meager 
quantity  by  the  Russian  Fur  Company.  They  had  no  fuel,  and  depended  for  heat  upon  the 
crowding  together  in  their  turf  houses,  sleeping  in  the  dried  grasses  secured  upon  the 
islands.  Forced  to  live  under  these  conditions  they  could  not  of  course  make  progress 
towards  civilization.  There  were  no  facilities  for  transporting  the  skins.  They  were  carried 
on  the  backs  of  the  natives,  entailing  great  labor  and  hardship. . . . 

Very  soon  after  the  islands  came  into  the  possession  of  the  American  Government  all  this 
was  changed.  Their  underground  earthen  lodges  were  replaced  by  warm,  comfortable 
wooden  cottages  for  each  family;  fuel,  food,  and  clothing  were  furnished  them  at  prices 
25  percent  above  the  wholesale  price  of  San  Francisco;  churches  were  built  and  school 
houses  maintained  for  their  benefit,  and  everything  done  that  would  insure  their  constant 
advancement  in  the  way  of  civilization  and  material  progress.  Instead  of  being  mere 
creatures  of  the  whims  of  their  rulers  they  were  placed  upon  an  equal  footing  with  white 
men,  and  received  by  law  a  stipulated  sum  for  each  skin  taken.  So  that  about  $40,000  was 
annually  divided  among  the  inhabitants  of  the  two  islands.  In  place  of  the  skin-clad  natives 
living  in  turf  lodges  which  I  found  on  arriving  on  the  island  in  1869, 1  left  them  in  1877 
as  well  fed,  as  well  clothed,  and  as  well  housed  as  the  people  of  some  of  our  New  England

villages.  They  had  school  facilities,  and  on  Sunday  they  went  to  service  in  the  pretty  Greek 
Church  with  its  tastefully  arranged  interior;  they  wore  the  clothing  of  civilized  men  and 
had  polish  on  their  boots.  All  these  results  are  directly  traceable  to  the  seal  fisheries  and 
their  improved  management. 

In  addition  to  this  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  as  previously  stated,  had  introduced 
far  better  facilities,  such  as  boats,  horses,  mules,  and  carts,  for  transporting  the  skins,  and 
improved  methods  of  caring  for  them.”78 


Samuel  A.  Falconer  (Falkner)  (1831-1915) 

Deputy  Collector  of  Customs,  Territory  of  Alaska,  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury, 
September  1868-September  1869 

Purser,  Hutchinson  &  Kohl  Steamer  Constantine,  September  1869-October  1870

Genealogy 

Samuel  (Falkner)  Falconer  9  was  born  September 
19,  1831,  at  Lancaster,  Glengarry  County, 

Ontario,  Canada,  the  son  of  James  Falkner 
(1798-1859)  and  Anne  Hay  Falkner.  He  lived 
on  the  Falkner  homestead  at  Lancaster  until  his 
marriage  to  Ellen  McKenzie  of  Williamstown, 
Ontario  Township.  Samuel  and  Ellen  Falkner 
had  three  children:  Ellen  Elizabeth;  Annie,  who 
married  Fred  Fleming;  and  Alexander  “Sandy” 
Falconer,  who  became  owner  of  a  hardware  store 
in  Deloraine,  Manitoba,  Canada.80  The  family 
records  presently  acquired  do  not  make  clear 
whether  Ellen  McKenzie  Falkner  died  before  or 
after  Samuel  came  to  the  United  States  in  1863. 

In  California  in  1880,  after  his  Alaska  service, 
Samuel  was  married  again,  to  widow  Josephine 
Erwin  Beckman  (1850-1905).  Joesephine  had 
two  children  by  her  previous  marriage,  William  and  Lillian  Beckman.  Lillian  (1870-1946) 
married  German-born  Baron  Albert  von  Steiger,  who  was  killed  by  Yaqui  Indians  near 
Ures,  Mexico,  February  25,  1906, 81  while  traveling  to  his  Mexican  gold  mines. 

The  1885  Dakota  Territory  census  showed  the  Samuel  Falconer  family  residing  in 
McLean  County  with  three  children  under  the  age  of  five;  Ida,  Frank,  and  Alfred.  Ida 
Daisy  was  born  September  17,  1880,  in  California,  and  eventually  married  Albert 
Swanson  of  Iowa  in  1905  at  Wilton,  North  Dakota.  She  died  March  6,  1978,  at  the  age  of 
ninety-eight.  Frank  Robert  (“Francis”)82  was  born  in  January  1883  in  the  Dakota  Territory. 
Alfred  Manley  was  born  in  April  1885  in  Dakota  Territory  and  died  in  Minneapolis,

Minnesota,  in  1948.  A  fourth  child,  Howard,  was 
born  into  the  Falconer  family  in  November  1886, 
also  in  Dakota  Territory;  he  married,  had  two  chil¬ 
dren  and  later  moved  to  Seattle,  Washington.83 

Biographical  Sketch 

At  the  age  of  thirty-two,  in  July  1863,  Samuel 
Falconer  crossed  the  St.  Lawrence  River  and 
landed  at  the  Port  of  Ogdensburg,  St.  Lawrence 
County,  New  York.  The  Civil  War  had  begun  in 
1861,  but  it  is  not  apparent  that  he  entered  the 
military  service. 

Beginning  in  1868,  Samuel  Falconer  served 
the  government  in  Alaska  for  eight  years.84  He 
was  Collector  of  the  Port  at  Sitka  during  the 
Ulysses  S.  Grant  administration  and  later  repre¬ 
sented  the  federal  government  looking  after  the 
seal  fisheries  in  the  Pribilofs. 

President  Andrew  Johnson  issued  an 
Executive  Order  August  26,  1868,  designating 
Sitka  a  port  of  entry  in  the  newly  acquired  District 
of  Alaska. 

The  port  of  Sitka  in  said  Territory,  is  hereby 
constituted  and  established  as  the  port  of  entry  for 
the  collection  district  of  Alaska,  provided  for  by 
said  act; . . .  the  shippers  giving  to  the  Collector  of 
Customs  at  the  port  of  shipment,  bonds  in  which 
it  shall  be  conditioned  that  articles  will,  on  their 
arrival  at  Sitka,  be  delivered  to  the  Collector  of 
Customs  or  the  person  there  acting  as  such,  to 
remain  in  his  possession  and  under  his  control  until 
sold  or  disposed  of  by  such  persons  as  the  military 
of  chief  authority  in  said  Territory  may  specify.85

In  his  annual  report  of  December  1,  1868, 
Secretary  of  the  Treasury  Hugh  McCulloch  an¬ 
nounced  “the  appointment  of  a  collector  [Samuel 
Falconer]  to  reside  at  Sitka,  who  left  for  his  post 
in  September  last.”

A  gentleman  from  this  Department  accompanied  him  to  assist  in  establishing  the 
collection  service  on  a  proper  foundation,  and  in  perfecting  arrangements  for  the 
prevention  of  smuggling.  Recognizing  also  the  vast  importance  of  reliable  information  on 
matters  not  immediately  connected  with  these  objects,  but  having  nevertheless  a  most 
important  bearing  upon  them  more  or  less  direct,  another  agent,  long  familiar  with  that 
country  [Charles  Byrant],  was  at  the  same  time  dispatched  with  directions  to  apply  himself 
to  the  ascertainment  of  its  natural  resources,  the  inducements  and  probable  channels  of 
trade,  and  the  needs  of  commerce  in  the  way  of  lights  and  other  aids  to  navigation.  He  was

also  particularly  entrusted  with  a  supervision  of  the  fur  interests  and  the  enforcement  of 
the  law  prohibiting  the  killing  of  the  most  valuable  fur-bearing  animals.86 

Hiram  Ketchum  Jr.,  Collector  of  Customs  for  the  District  of  Alaska,  officially  ap¬ 
pointed  Samuel  Falconer  on  December  14,  1868,  as  Special  Deputy  Collector  of  Customs 
for  the  District  of  Alaska  in  the  Territory  of  Alaska.8  Ketchum  and  Falconer,  along  with 
Charles  Bryant,  as  noted  in  Bryant’s  January  5,  1869,  letter  (see  Bryant’s  biography  for  ex¬ 
cerpts  of  the  letter),  had  left  the  port  of  New  York  on  September  16,  1868,  on  the  steam¬ 
ship  Ocean  Queen,  headed  for  San  Francisco  enroute  to  the  Territory  of  Alaska.88

Once  settled  into  his  position  at  Sitka,  Falconer  took  part  in  the  social  life  of  the  town. 
An  invitation  from  Madame  Kadvilavansky,  the  wife  of  Archpriest  Pavel  Kadvilavansky 
(1834?— 1878)  of  Sitka,89  read:  “Madam  Kadvilavansky  presents  her  compliments  to  Mr. 
Falconer  and  requests  the  pleasure  of  his  company  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Ivanoff  at  half  past 
six  o’clock  this  evening  Monday  December  21st  1868.”90 

Other  events  included  a  military  ball.  Captain  Charles  Bryant  wrote  of  Sitka’s  federal 
presence  at  the  time:  “It  consists  of  the  military  garrison  and  its  necessary  accompani¬ 
ments  of  soldiers  [or]  about  three  hundred  including  officers,  next  in  rank  is  the  civil 
service,  this  is  represented  by  one  collector  of  customs,  one  deputy,  two  special  agents; 
one  for  revenue  purposes  the  other  for  general  observation  and  one  clerk.”91  The  color¬ 
ful  invitation  to  the  ball  given  by  the  “Officers  of  the  Army,  Navy,  Revenue  Service  and 
the  Citizens  of  Sitka”  on  February  8,  1869,  was  sent  to  Falconer  by  the  “Committee  of 
Arrangements”  consisting  of  U.S.  Army — William  M.  Dennison  and  Charles  P.  Eagan; 
U.S.  Revenue  Service —  J.  R.  Delan;  and  U.S.  Navy —  E.  W.  Bridge.92

The  First  Three  Managers  ♦  Falconer 


Samuel  Falconer’s  duties  as  Deputy  Collector  of  Customs  gave  him  the  right  to  con¬ 
fiscate  illegal  cargo,  such  as  liquor  coming  into  the  Territory  of  Alaska.  One  of  his  confis¬ 
cations  was  protested  by  the  captain  of  the  bark  Monticello  in  1869. 

Sitka,  Alaska  Tery  Feby  27  1869 
Mr.  Samuel  Falconer 
Deputy  Collector  of  Customs 
Sitka,  A.  T. 

Sir: 

We,  the  undersigned,  Master  and  Supercargo  of  the  Am.  Bark  Monticello,  now  lying  in  the 
port  of  Sitka  and  bound  for  St.  Pauls’  island  and  other  ports  in  Alaska  Territory,  do  hereby 
protest  against  the  seizure  under  your  authority  of  one  qr.  Cask  of  whiskey  (40  galls).  We 
claim  that  the  said  whiskey  was  put  on  board  the  said  Bark  at  Honolulu  H.  I.  in  good  faith 
in  ignorance  of  any  law  prohibiting  the  importation  of  liquor  in  the  said  Territory — that 
on  ascertaining  the  existence  of  such  a  law  we  represented  to  you  our  readiness  to  execute 
sufficient  bonds,  that  the  said  whiskey  should  not  be  landed  in  the  Territory  or  used  in 
trading  with  Indians.  We  further  claim  that  we  had  not  up  to  the  time  of  the  seizure  of 
the  said  whiskey  violated  any  law  not  having  made  any  attempt  to  land  the  same  and  [not] 
having  intention  of  violating  any  law. 

J  [Jeremiah]  Potts  Master  of  Bk  [Bark]  Monticello 
I  Bates  Dickson,  Supercargo  of  Bk  Monticello 93 

The  Monticello  was  next  seen  at  St.  Paul  Island  on  March  26,  1869,  by  Inspectors  of 
Customs,  Mr.  La  Grange  and  Joseph  Wilson,  who  arrived  prior  to  Special  Agent  Charles 
Bryant  to  take  possession  of  the  island  for  the  government.  “On  our  arrival  we  found  the 
bark  Monticello  laden  with  trading  goods  from  the  port  of  Honolulu  in  the  Sandwich 
Islands.94  We  at  once  notified  the  captain,  in  accordance  with  our  orders  that  he  could  not 
land  his  cargo,  and  he  immediately  departed.”95 

In  1882,  following  his  Pribilofs  experience,  Samuel  Falconer  settled  in  North  Dakota 
and  engaged  in  the  ranching  and  stock-raising  business  along  the  Missouri  River,  eight 
miles  from  Wilton,  North  Dakota.96  The  township  bore  the  name  Falconer.  A  post  office 
with  Samuel  Falconer  as  postmaster  was  established  April  14,  1884,  on  the  Old  River 
Stage  Road  between  Bismarck  and  Washburn.  On  June  4,  1890,  he  received  a  deeded 
homestead  of  160  acres  in  Falconer,  North  Dakota. 

The  Falconer  long,  low  log  house,  which  served  as  a  home  and  post  office,  was  about  10 
miles  southeast  of  Washburn.97 

Falconer  swore  to  his  intention  to  become  a  citizen  of  the  United  States  on  April  12, 
1883,  in  Burleigh  County,  Dakota  Territory;  his  citizenship  was  sealed  February  7,  1889, 
at  the  same  location.  After  he  had  led  a  farmer’s  life  for  over  twenty  years,  the  citizens  of 
Wilton  elected  Samuel  Falconer  Justice  of  the  Peace  in  their  April  8,  1912,  election,  ac¬ 
cording  him  the  title  of  Judge  Samuel  A.  Falconer.  He  held  the  position  until  his  sudden 
death  in  1915.98

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

According  to  a  news  article  in  the  Wilton,  North  Dakota,  newspaper  Wilton  News,  Samuel 
Falconer  was  requested  to  meet  with  President  Rutherford  B.  Hayes  and  Secretary  of 
State  James  G.  Blaine  in  1892,  some  sixteen  years  after  his  Pribilof  Islands  career  ended. 

An  investigation  of  alleged  irregularities  in  the  seal  fisheries  during  the  administration  of 
President  Hayes,  required  the  presence  of  Mr.  Falconer  in  Washington  City  as  an  expert 
witness  and  while  in  the  Capital  City  he  met  many  prominent  men,  including  President 
Hayes  and  James  G.  Blaine." 

Falconer  received  a  letter  from  Secretary  Blaine  dated  and  posted  on  April  7,  1892, 
calling  him  to  Washington,  D.C.: 

It  is  desired  on  behalf  of  the  United  States  Government  that  you  will  come  to  Washington 
in  order  to  make  a  statement  of  your  knowledge  of  fur  seal  matters  on  the  Pribilof  Islands. 

It  will  be  most  convenient  to  the  Government  if  you  can  reach  here  on  or  about  the  14th 
or  15th  instant.  On  your  arrival  in  Washington  please  report  to  Mr.  John  W.  Foster  at  the 
Department  of  State.  You  will  be  paid  your  traveling  expenses  and  a  per  diem  while  in  this 
city.  I  have  to  request  that  upon  receipt  of  this  letter  you  will  advise  Mr.  John  W.  Foster,  at 
the  Department  of  State,  by  telegraph,  when  you  may  be  expected.  The  telegram  will  be 
paid  here.100 

Two  weeks  after  the  Blaine  letter  was  written,  Samuel  Falconer  deposed  for  the  Fur- 
Seal  Arbitration  at  Washington,  D.C.,  on  April  19,  1892.  His  testimony,  recorded  by 
Samuel  Brown,  provided  an  historical  outline  of  his  government  service  in  the  Territory 
of  Alaska  and  on  the  Pribilof  Islands. 

I  am  61  years  of  age,  and  am  now  a  wool  grower  by  occupation.  My  residence  is  Falconer, 

McLean  County,  State  of  North  Dakota.  In  1868,  during  the  month  of  October  I  went  to 
Sitka,  being  located  there  as  deputy  collector  of  customs,  in  which  position  I  remained 
until  September,  1869. 1  then  was  employed  until  September,  1870,  as  purser  on  board  the 
steamer  Constantine,  plying  monthly  between  Port  Townsend  and  Sitka. 

In  1870,  in  the  month  of  October,  having  been  appointed  assistant  Treasury  agent  for  the 
seal  islands  in  Bering  Sea,  I  proceeded  to  said  islands,  and  from  that  time  until  August, 

1876, 1  remained  constantly  in  charge  of  St.  George  Island,  excepting  during  the  winter 
of  1874-75.  For  a  few  days  during  each  one  of  these  years  I  visited  St.  Paul  Island,  never 
remaining  there  for  any  length  of  time. . . . 

In  1873, 1  assisted  Prof.  Henry  W.  Elliott  in  making  his  measurements  and  estimates  of  the 
number  of  seals  on  St.  George  Island.  We  set  up  stakes  at  some  distance  from  the  breeding 
rookeries  while  they  were  occupied.  Then  when  the  seals  were  gone  we  sighted  along  these 
stakes  to  determine  the  back  lines  of  the  rookeries  and  measured  the  areas  thus  determined 
with  a  tape  line,  using  our  judgment  by  observing  the  nature  of  the  ground  to  determine 
the  curvature  of  these  areas.  We  then  calculated  from  our  observations  three  seals  to  a 
square  yard,  and  multiplying  the  yards  in  the  areas  measured  by  three  made  our  estimate.101 

Henry  W.  Elliott’s  calculation  of  the  average  number  of  fur  seals  per  square  yard  even¬ 
tually  proved  grossly  inaccurate.102 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

After  serving  as  Deputy  Collector  of  Customs  in  Sitka  and  later  purser  aboard  the 
Hutchinson  &  Kohl  vessel  Constantine,  Samuel  Falconer  was  appointed  Assistant  Agent 
for  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury  and  was  assigned  to  the  Pribilof  Island  of  St. 


65 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


George.  Agent  Charles  Bryant  made  the  appointment  and  apparently  possessed  authority 
to  do  so,  although  he  required  confirmation,  as  explained  in  his  letter  from  St.  Paul  Island 
to  the  Honorable  George  S.  Boutwell,  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  Washington,  D.C.,  dated 
October  19,  1870. 

Sir:  On  the  9th  instant103  the  steamer  Constantine,  belonging  to  the  Alaska  Commercial 
Company  [formerly  owned  by  Hutchinson  &  Kohl],  arrived  here,  bringing  to  me  a  letter 
of  the  collector  of  customs  at  San  Francisco. ...  I  found  on  board  the  Constantine,  as 
passenger,  Mr.  Samuel  Falconer,  late  deputy  and  acting  collector  at  Sitka,  who  stated  to  me 
that  he  had  left  the  service  of  Hutchinson,  Kohl  &  Co.,  and  would  offer  his  services  to  the 
Government. 

Having  in  view  the  desire  expressed  to  me  by  Mr.  Buynitzky,  in  July,  to  be  relieved  this 
fall  from  his  temporary  duties  at  Saint  George,  in  consideration  of  urgent  family  matters 
requiring  his  presence  at  Washington,  I  thought  it  advisable  to  avail  myself  of  Mr. 

Falconer’s  offer,  and,  by  letter  of  the  10th  instant,  I  appointed  him,  subject  to  the  approval 
of  the  Department,  assistant  special  agent  [Assistant  Agent],  at  a  compensation  of  $6 
per  diem;  and  after  his  filing  the  customary  oath  of  office,  I  instructed  him  to  proceed, 
together  with  myself  to  the  island  of  Saint  George.  On  the  12th  instant  we  sailed  over  to 
Saint  George,  where  he  relieved  Mr.  Buynitzky,  who  was  thus  made  free  to  proceed  to 
Washington.104 

Falconer  went  to  work  before  receiving  official  approval  from  the  Treasury  Secretary 
of  his  appointment  by  Capt.  Bryant.  His  first  report  of  conditions  on  St.  George  covered 
the  period  from  his  appointment  of  October  1870  to  May  14,  1871.  It  read,  in  part: 

I  was  not  long  a  resident  of  the  place  until  I  found,  to  my  astonishment,  a  higher  degree 
of  civilization  existing  among  them  [native  population]  than  I  anticipated;  and  I  am 
happy  to  add  in  reference  to  this  that  the  new  arrivals  who  are  in  the  employ  of  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company  proved  to  be  no  ways  detrimental  to  them  in  their  ideas  but  on 
the  contrary  assisted  them  in  carrying  out  this  order  of  civilization  into  a  higher  degree 
of  perfection.  Indeed,  I  can  not  speak  too  highly  of  Mr.  Brown,  the  agent  of  this  company, 
who  has  been  very  particular  in  carrying  out  the  conditions  of  the  agreement  between  the 
company  and  the  Government,  and  the  many  other  acts  of  kindness  shown  them  in  aid  of 
their  comfort  has  rendered  him  quite  a  favorite  among  them. 

The  company  has  furnished  abundance  of  everything  that  is  necessary  for  the  comfort  and 
sustenance  of  life,  and  from  the  very  low  prices  charged  on  many  of  the  principal  articles 
has  left  no  room  for  complaints. 

In  speaking  of  these  people,  I  may  safely  state  that  I  know  of  no  class  of  the  human  race 
that  enjoy  themselves  any  more  than  they  do.  Scarcely  has  an  evening  passed  over  their 
heads  but  they  have  engaged  in  dancing  or  some  other  amusements. 

On  the  1st  of  November  last  a  school  was  reestablished  for  the  natives,  the  attendance  of 
which  numbers  about  25,  and  from  the  advanced  state  they  were  left  in  by  our  friend  Mr. 

Buynitzky  it  was  no  difficult  task  to  get  along  with  them.  They  are  making  rapid  progress, 
and  feel  anxious  to  learn  the  English  language.  Men  who  have  advanced  to  the  age  of  30 
and  40  attend  school  and  [are]  making  equal  progress. 

The  temperature  of  the  weather  I  kept,  and  used  Fahrenheit’s  thermometer.  For  the  last  two 
months  of  the  year  1870  the  mean  temperature  ranged  as  follows:  For  November,  30.80; 

December,  28.60;  for  January,  1871,  mean  30.04;  February,  23.22;  March,  14.85,  and  April, 

32.52. . . .  On  the  2d  of  this  month  the  ice  made  its  appearance  and  landed  on  the  north 
side  of  the  island  in  a  limited  quantity,  but  day  after  day  it  forced  its  way  along  from  the 
north  until  it  made  a  complete  bridge  between  this  island  and  that  of  St.  Paul.  Indeed,  I  am 
of  opinion  that  the  whole  surface  of  the  sea  to  the  north  of  this  was  a  solid  sheet  of  ice.  In  a 
report  given  by  a  former  agent  of  the  Territory,  it  was  stated  that  the  white  bear  was  known

to  frequent  these  islands.  At  that  time  I  doubted  the  assertion,  but  to-day  I  am  ready  to 
indorse  it.  Not  that  I  have  seen  any  pay  us  a  visit,  but  it  is  not  but  what  an  opportunity  has 
presented  itself  for  them  to  do  so.105 

Samuel  Falconer  served  as  assistant  agent  at  St.  George  Island  for  a  year  and  a  half 
before  his  official  certificate  of  appointment  was  received  in  March  of  1872.  Copies  of 
Falconer’s  Treasury  appointment  and  instructions  letters  were  preserved  in  family  papers, 
and  are  transcribed  here:

Assistant  Agent  Samuel 
Falconer,  March  13,  1872 
at  a  per  diem  of  $8.00.

3d.  Keep  an  accurate  record  of  marriages,  births,  and  deaths,  and  the  cause  of  their  death, 
as  they  occur. 

4th.  Keep  an  accurate  record  of  changes  and  removals,  arrivals  of  the  natives  to  and  from 
the  island. 

5th.  Keep  a  daily  journal  of  the  weather,  together  with  any  observations  or  remarks  that  are 
likely  to  be  of  future  use  to  the  general  interests  of  the  island. 

Assistant  Agent  Francis  Lessen,  a  copy  of  whose  instructions  is  here-with  transmitted  to 
you,  will  report  to  you  to  assist  in  the  performance  of  these  duties.107 

Samuel  Falconer  proved  industrious  in  his  responsibilities  as  assistant  agent  for  the 
Treasury  Department  at  St.  George  Island,  as  documented  in  his  annual  reports.  Before 
his  retirement  in  October  1876,  he  assisted  in  the  development  of  the  island’s  infrastruc¬ 
ture,  along  with  the  agents  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company.  In  1872,  he  helped  with 
the  construction  of  the  first  wooden  Native  houses  and  a  house  for  government  employ¬ 
ees.  By  1873,  he  had  outlined  roads  and  plank  walkways,  and  built  barns  and  a  workshop. 
He  had  a  well  dug  for  drinking  water  in  1874,  and  saw  to  the  construction  of  a  new  church 
and  school  building,  both  completed  in  October  1876,  just  before  he  left  government

service.  Other  detailed  descriptions  of  St.  George  Island  during  this  period  are  found 
in  Emma  J.  McIntyre’s  letter  to  her  mother  (presented  later  in  her  biography).  Emma’s 
husband,  William  McIntyre,  was  the  second  assistant  agent  for  the  Department  of  the 
Treasury  at  St.  George  Island  and  served  with  Samuel  Falconer.  The  following  two  seg¬ 
ments  of  Falconer’s  1873  and  1874  yearly  reports  offer  an  intimate,  detailed  picture  of  life 
on  this  island.  From  the  1873  report: 

The  material  for  the  Government  house,  landed  here  by  the  steamer  Alexander  in 
August  last,  was  erected  according  to  plans  and  specifications,  with  this  exception,  a  rock 
foundation  was  placed  underneath  the  building  instead  of  posts,  as  the  plan  provided, 
there  being  good  material  near  at  hand  for  that  purpose.  I  also  found  it  necessary  to  erect 
an  addition  9  feet  square  inclosing  the  back  door,  and  furnishing  a  suitable  place  for  water, 
coal,  etc. 


The  labor  account  for  the  erection  of  this  building  amounted  to  $377,  as  per  vouchers 
herewith  enclosed;  also  please  find  bills  to  the  amount  of  $159.97  for  necessary  articles 
purchased  for  the  use  of  the  building  in  all,  $536.97. 

I  may  here  state  that  the  foundation  when  complete  cost  about  $100  extra.  Thus  making  an 
additional  expense,  but  as  there  were  no  posts  on  the  island  suitable  for  the  purpose  I  was 
compelled  to  use  the  rock,  which  is,  in  my  opinion,  well  worth  the  difference. 

The  laborers  were  paid  according  as  the  work  progressed  through  the  kindness  of  the 
Alaska  Commercial  Company,  and  at  the  same  rate  per  diem  as  paid  by  said  company  when 
employed  by  them. 


Much  difficulty  was  experienced  during  the  erection  from  the  continuous  rains  and  general 
foul  state  of  the  weather.  In  consequence  of  this  there  was  but  one  other  building  erected 
last  season  -  by  Mr.  Adams,  the  company’s  agent,  which  was  finely  fitted  up  for  a  store,  the 
old  one  having  been  converted  into  a  schoolhouse.  In  September  last  the  company’s  bark 
Cyane  landed  a  large  quantity  of  lumber  for  native  houses,  but  their  erection  was  prevented 
for  like  reasons  already  stated.108 


In  August  of  1874,  Falconer  addressed  his  yearly  report  directly  to  Secretary  of  the 
Treasury  Benjamin  H.  Bristow  rather  than  per  protocol  as  an  attachment  to  Agent-in- 

Charge  Charles  Bryant’s  annual  report,  as  he  had 
previously  done.  Falconer’s  nine-page  report  in¬ 
cluded  not  just  a  general  overview  of  activities 
at  St.  George  Island  during  the  previous  year  but 
also  greater  detail  about  the  “habits  and  peculiar- 

fities  of  the  fur  seal.”109  Falconer  had  been  assisted 


Samuel  Falconer  in  Dakota  Territory. 
(Courtesy  Marilyn  Valkenburg  and  Steven 
R.  Day.) 


during  the  1873-74  season  by  fur-seal  expert 
Henry  W.  Elliott.  (Elliott  submitted  to  Secretary 
Bristow  his  277-page  Report  Upon  the  Condition 
of  Affairs  in  the  Territory  of  Alaska,  November 
10,  1874,  which  was  printed  by  the  Government 
Printing  Office  in  1875.)  During  this  time,  Elliott 
had  been  critical  of  Agent  Bryant’s  reporting  of 
the  fur-seal  conditions  in  his  communications  to 
Professor  Spencer  Baird  of  the  Smithsonian.110 
One  may  infer  from  Elliott’s  overt  behavior  that 
he  also  exerted  influence  on  Falconer  to  submit

The  First  Three  Managers  ♦  Falconer 


his  (Falconer’s)  annual  report  directly  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  over  the  head  of 
his  supervisor,  Bryant.  Statements  made  by  William  H.  Dali,  Acting  Assistant-in-Charge 
Alaska  Coast,  U.S.  Coast  Survey,  in  his  November  14,  1873,  letter  to  Spencer  Baird  sup¬ 
port  such  an  inference  (see  Charles  Bryant’s  biography).  In  his  letter,  Dali  also  mentioned 
that  Falconer  was  a  great  friend  of  Elliott’s.111  Falconer’s  1874  report,  excerpted  below, 
described  the  physical  nature  of  the  island,  the  habits  of  the  fur  seal  and  the  seals'  breed¬ 
ing  grounds,  aspects  of  the  seal  harvesting,  sea  lions,  and  interesting  details  about  the 
Native  population.  Regarding  the  Natives,  one  will  note  that  Falconer’s  1874  report  was 
in  marked  contrast  with  his  1871  report,  presented  above,  respecting  the  eagerness  of  the 
Native  population  to  learn  English. 

There  is  on  the  south  side  of  the  island  a  small  sea-lion  rookery,  where  these  animals 
number  about  4,000.  The  greater  portion  of  them  remain  around  the  island  all  winter,  or 
until  the  ice  drives  them  away.  A  great  many  are  taken  by  the  natives  during  this  season  for 
food,  the  flesh  being  of  a  much  finer  quality  and  flavor  than  that  of  the  fur  seal.  The  skins 
are  used  by  the  natives  in  the  construction  of  bidarkas  and  bidarrahs  (native  boats).112 

As  is  well  known,  the  natives  were  brought  by  the  Russians  from  the  Aleutian  Islands  and 
were  upon  the  island  when  it  was  ceded  to  the  United  States.  They  are  of  a  dark  copper 
color,  with  long,  lank,  and  black  coarse  hair.  The  beard  is  very  defective  and  never  makes 
any  appearance  until  the  man  is  well  advanced  in  years,  and  then  only  a  few  straggling 
hairs.  Their  medium  height  is  below  that  of  the  European,  with  a  few  rare  exceptions. . 

. .  They  are  good  natured  and  cheerful,  at  times  slightly  irascible,  but  are  never  cruel  or 
overbearing  except  when  under  the  influence  of  quas.m  They  possess  one  trait  of  character, 

I  think,  peculiar  to  themselves;  that  is,  they  never  harbor  revengeful  feelings.  I  have  known 
them  to  express  a  dislike  for  a  person,  but  when  he  had  left  the  island,  perhaps  never  to 
return,  they  remembered  only  the  kindness  they  received  at  his  hands  and  never  spoke  ill 
of  him.  They  are  industrious,  but  not  avaricious,  and  always  appear  ready  and  willing  to 
obey  the  summons  of  their  chief  or  the  agents  of  the  company  or  the  Government. 

In  their  expenditures  many  of  them  are  prodigal.  This,  however,  may  be  partly  attributed 
to  the  voluntary  generosity  of  the  company  in  providing  for  them  comfortable  houses 
rent  free,  furnishing  them  good  wages  for  their  labor,  and  supporting  their  widows  and 
orphans.114 

They  are  all  members  of  the  Greek  Church  and  appear  very  much  attached  to  their  faith, 
which  I  have  always  encouraged,  as  I  have  found  that  their  church  exercises  a  strong 
influence  over  them  for  good. 

The  worst  evil  they  are  addicted  to  is  quas  drinking.  This  is  a  kind  of  beer  they  brew 
from  flour  and  sugar,  and  sometimes  from  a  small  berry  that  grows  upon  the  island. 

Their  educational  progress  has  not  been  very  satisfactory,  from  the  fact  that  they  have  an 
antipathy  to  the  English  tongue,  believing  that  if  their  children  grow  up  with  a  knowledge 
of  our  language  and  customs  it  will  alienate  them  from  the  faith  of  their  parents,  and  they 
accordingly  encourage  the  absence  of  their  children  from  the  school.  They  desire  that 
their  children  should  acquire  the  Russian  language  first,  in  order  that  they  may  be  enabled 
to  read  the  liturgy  of  their  church.  For  this  purpose  and  when  they  have  had  school  they 
would  privately  teach  the  Russian  tongue,  the  children  all  assembling  at  a  particular  house 
for  this  purpose. 

If  a  priest  were  stationed  upon  each  island  who  would  instruct  them  in  both  languages 
and  give  them  to  understand  that  an  English  education  would  in  nowise  conflict  with  their 
religious  duties,  they  would  in  my  opinion,  encourage  their  children  to  attend  school  with 
more  regularity.  Their  progress  then  would  be  swift  and  sure,  as  they  are  naturally  apt 
scholars.  The  presence  of  a  priest  upon  the  island  would  also  have  a  moral  effect  upon  them

that  would  be  invaluable,  and  I  would  respectfully  recommend  to  the  Department  that 
some  provision  be  made  for  one  on  each  island.115 

Interestingly,  and  apparently  unbeknownst  to  Falconer,  Secretary  of  the  Treasury 
George  Boutwell  had  three  years  earlier  authorized  the  assigning  of  Russian  Orthodox 
“curates”  to  each  island  at  the  behest  of  the  Orthodox  bishop  at  San  Francisco.  Secretary 
Boutwell  wrote  on  July  19,  1871: 

Sir, 

The  Russian  Minister  has,  through  the  Secretary  of  State,  by  letter  dated  the  30th  of  June 
1871,  mentioned  that  the  Orthodox  Bishop  John  of  San  Francisco,  deems  it  necessary, 
in  order  to  supply  the  religious  wants  of  the  inhabitants  of  the  Islands  of  St.  Paul  and  St. 

George,  that  curates  of  the  same  religious  faith  should  be  sent  to  reside  at  said  islands. 

You  are  therefore  authorized,  under  and  by  virtue  of  the  powers  conferred  on  me  by  the 
Joint  Resolution  of  March  3,  1869,  to  allow  two  curates  who  may  be  furnished  with  the 
proper  testimonial  from  said  Bishop,  to  proceed  to  the  islands  named  for  the  purpose  of 
taking  up  their  residence  there  at  -  one  on  each  island.116 

The  next  day,  July  20,  1871,  Secretary  Boutwell  sent  a  letter  to  Agent  Bryant: 

I  transmit  herewith  for  your  information  and  guidance,  a  copy  of  the  Department’s  letter 
of  the  19th  instant,  to  the  Collection  of  Customs  at  Sitka,  Alaska,  authorizing  curates 
furnished  with  proper  testimonials  from  the  Orthodox  Bishop  John  of  San  Francisco,  to 
reside  upon  the  Islands  of  St.  Paul  and  St.  George.117 

Whether  Agent  Bryant  shared  this  correspondence  with  Assistant  Agent  Falconer 
was  not  determined,  nor  is  it  clear  that  the  Orthodox  Church  made  any  attempt  to  move 
a  priest  to  St.  George  Island  until  Father  Innokenty  Lestenkof  became  the  resident  cleric 
in  1882. 

Samuel  Falconer  remained  in  government  service  as  assistant  agent  of  St.  George 
Island  until  the  appointment  on  October  1,  1876,  of  Colonel  George  Marston  of  New 
Hampshire.

ent  authors  examined  Fur-Seal  Arbitration,  vol.  1,  89,  but  were  unable  to  find  the  cited  letter.  The 
Fur-Seal  Arbitration  series  contains  a  sixteenth  volume,  not  recognized  as  volume  16  but  rather 
titled  “Facsimiles  or  Documents  in  the  Alaskan  Archives,  Department  of  State  of  the  United  States,

Following  the  internal  cover  page,  the  document  begins  with  a  title,  “Russian  Correspondence 
Relating  to  the  Affairs  of  the  Russian  American  Company.”  The  aforementioned  letter  attributed  to 
Mr.  Milovidof  may  be  within  this  sixteenth  volume.  The  authors  have  come  across  other  citations  of 
various  page  numbers  within  the  sixteen-volume  set  of  U.S.  Senate,  Fur-Seal  Arbitration,  and  again 
were  unable  to  find  the  referenced  material.  We  conclude,  rightly  or  wrongly,  that  the  page  numbers

Island.  He  did  not  account  for  his  reasons  for  leaving  the  Pribilofs,  but  he  did  address  the  quality  of 
life.  "The  people  on  the  islands  are  allowed  in  large  measure,  to  govern  themselves.  In  former  years 
they  selected  their  own  chiefs,  who  dealt  directly  with  the  people  and  were  in  turn  dealt  with  by  the 
government  official.  Now  the  government  agents  appoint  a  man,  who  acts  as  an  overseer.”  (p.  4). 
“They  [the  Natives]  pay  nothing  for  rent,  taxes,  medical  attendance  or  schooling  and  for  [the]  largest 
part  of  the  year  they  get  their  meat  free.  (p.  4).  “Under  Government  control  the  natives  are  much 
better  off  than  [the]  great  majority  of  the  working  class  anywhere  in  the  world.  They  are  housed  in 
concrete  and  electrically  lighted,  comfortable  homes.  There  is  a  wireless  station  and  movie  picture 
shows  free  of  charge.  Now  since  [the]  seals  herd  increased,  their  earnings  will  increase  and  in  time 
will  even  become  wealthy.”  (p.  5)  “There  are  no  Commercial  Banks,  but  all  the  natives  savings  are 
kept  for  their  accounts — at  4%  in  San  Francisco  Banks,  and  the  accrual  interest  paid  them  annually.” 
(p.  6)  “Two  school  houses  presided  by  two  competent  teachers,  where  only  English  is  taught.”  (p.  6). 
“Diet  of  these  people  in  summer  is  mostly,  fresh  seal  meat,  cod  fish,  and  halibut;  in  winters  rein¬ 
deer,  salted  meats  and  canned  meats — canned  vegetables  +  fruit  and  potatoes  comprise  their  daily 
diet.”  (p.  7).  A  photocopy  of  Simeon’s  seven-page  discourse  was  provided  to  the  authors,  courtesy  of 
Simeon’s  grandson  Alexander  Steele  Melovidoff.

ACC;  we  do  not  know  whether  Dali’s  allegations  supported  the  investigation,  but  the  allegations  put 
before  the  investigators  were  found  to  lack  merit.

79  Samuel  and  his  brother  William  changed  the  spelling  of  the  family  name  from  Falkner  to  Falconer 
not  “in  the  late  1880’s  to  alleviate  the  confusion  in  receipt  of  mail”  as  otherwise  suggested,  but 
sooner,  as  Samuel  was  using  that  spelling  in  1868.  One  can  only  speculate  this  change  occurred 
when  they  immigrated  to  the  United  States  from  Canada.  Samuel’s  niece,  Hazel  L.  Falconer,  noted 
the  1880  date  as  family  oral  tradition  in  her  genealogy  notebook,  and  it  was  transcribed  in  the 
book  Burleigh  County:  Prairie  Trails  to  Hi-Ways,  by  Bauman  and  Jackman  (Dallas:  Taylor,  1978). 
Unfortunately,  the  genealogy  notebook  contained  numerous  inaccuracies  about  Samuel’s  Alaska 
work,  and  in  turn  these  inaccuracies  were  included  in  the  Bauman  and  Jackman  publication,  as  well 
as  other  family  history  publications.  For  example,  Samuel’s  appointment  to  the  post  in  Sitka,  his  job 
description,  and  how  he  obtained  it  are  reported  incorrectly.  Samuel’s  Customs  appointment  did 
not  come  from  Secretary  of  State  Robert  Lansing,  credited  with  the  appointment,  as  Lansing  was 
only  four  years  old  in  1868;  he  served  as  Secretary  of  State  from  1915-1920.  Also,  Samuel  never 
wrote  a  book  on  the  fur-seal  rookeries  although  he  did  assist  Henry  W.  Elliott  in  measurements 
and  gathered  information  for  Elliott’s  1873  publication.  Hazel  Falconer  spent  many  years  collecting 
family  history;  the  notebooks  of  her  work  are  with  Dorothy  Falconer,  Bismarck,  ND.  Pages  139-42

The  Russian  Orthodox  Church 

ON  THE  PRIBILOF  ISLANDS 


The  Russian  Orthodox  faith,  or  Orthodoxy,1  permeated  Native  life  throughout  the 
Aleutian  Islands  and  became  no  less  important  in  the  Seal  Islands.  First  introduced  by  the 
Russian  promyshlenniki  and  merchants  such  as  Gregorii  Shelikov,  and  later  (from  1794) 
aided  by  missionary  monks,  Russian  Orthodoxy  was  accepted  by  the  Unangan/Unangas 
as  their  own  faith  for  reasons  best  explained  by  experts  on  the  subject  (see  Veniaminov, 
Notes  on  the  Islands  of  the  Unalashka  District,  1984;  Afonsky,  A  History  of  the  Orthodox 
Church  in  Alaska,  1794-1917, 1977;  and  Oleksa,  Orthodox  Alaska:  A  Theology  of  Mission, 
1992).  The  Russian-American  Company,  established  in  1799,  furthered  the  spread 
of  Orthodoxy  beyond  the  Aleutians,  such  that  it  became  the  predominant  faith  in  the 
Territory  of  Alaska  during  the  19th  century.2 

Russian-American  Company  employees,  including  many  Aleuts,  built  the  first  chapel 
at  St.  George  Island  in  1833  using  driftwood  collected  along  the  shoreline.3  They  dedi¬ 
cated  the  chapel  to  Sv.  Georgii  Pobedonosets,  or  St.  George  the  Victor.4  The  little  chapel 
survived  until  it  was  replaced  in  1876. 

In  1897,  Alexander  Kedrovsky,  Dean 
of  the  Unalaska  Region,  with  the  as¬ 
sistance  of  the  St.  George  Island  priest, 
Father  Rafael  Kedrovsky,  consecrated 
the  1876  chapel  as  St.  George  Island’s 
first  church,  Church  of  St.  George  the 
Victorious,  Holy  Martyr.5

the  Victor  Chapel,  St.  George  Island.  The 
chapel  was  constructed  of  driftwood  in  1833.

Louis  Pinart,  circa  1871.  (Courtesy  Bancroft 
Library,  Univ.  of  California  Berkeley.) 


In  1934,  construction  began  on  a  new  place 
of  worship  to  replace  the  deteriorating  Church 
of  St.  George  the  Victorious,  Holy  Martyr.6 
In  1936,  Bishop  Alexii  consecrated  the  new 
Church  of  St.  George.7  The  St.  George  Island 
Agent  and  Caretaker,  John  W.  Lipke,  noted  in 
his  Annual  Report  of  1935: 

It  is  the  Agents  understanding  that  all  materials 
for  the  construction  of  this  church  are  to  be 
furnished  by  the  natives,  all  the  labor  is  to  be 
furnished  by  the  Bureau  of  Fisheries,  and  then 
only  at  times  when  it  will  not  interfere  with  other 
Government  [sic]  work.8 

Agent  Lipke  had  moved  to  St.  Paul  Island 
by  the  time  of  the  1936  Annual  Report,  which 
was  submitted  by  Agent  and  Caretaker  Lee.  C. 
McMillin,  who  wrote: 

Natives  this  year  [1936]  are  building  themselves 
a  new  church.  It  is  considerable  [sic]  bigger  than 
the  old  one.  Has  a  full  basement  and  will  be 
heated  by  a  furnace.  Material  and  supplies  for 
this  has  been  paid  for  from  the  Church  funds. 

This  is  exclusive  of  their  canteen  funds.  At 
present  writing  the  church  is  nearing  completion 
altho  it  will  take  them  quite  a  while  to  finish  it 
as  they  are  only  allowed  to  work  in  it  during 
working  hours  only  when  it  will  not  interfere 
with  the  Bureau’s  activities. 

Rt.  Rev.  Alexy  [Alexii],  Bishop  of  Alaska,  spent 
the  winter  on  St.  George  as  priest  of  the  Church 
in  place  of  Rev.  Shabanoff  who  is  out  to  the 
States  on  vacation.  Bishop  Alexy  expects  to 
dedicate  the  New  Church  before  he  leaves  in 
May.9

During  WWII,  the  St.  George  church  served 
as  a  chapel  for  troops  of  all  faiths  stationed  on 
the  island,  and  its  bell  tower  was  used  as  a  look¬ 
out  post.10  Forty  years  after  the  war  the  Aleuts 
received  compensation  for  damage  inflicted  by 
U.S.  military  troops  upon  churches  throughout 
the  Aleutians  as  well  as  on  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  islands.  As  amended,  the  Aleutian 
and  Pribilof  Islands  Restitution  Act  of  1988  authorized  a  Congressional  appropriation  of 
$4.7  million  to  restore  six  churches.  A  report  by  the  Aleutian-Pribilof  Islands  Association 
(APIA)—  Making  It  Right:  Restitution  for  Churches  Damaged  and  Lost  During  the  Aleut 
Relocation  in  World  War  II — helped  determine  the  level  of  compensation.11  Finally,  in 
1997-98,  the  Church  of  St.  George  the  Victorious  was  renovated  at  a  cost  of  $771, 368. 12

The  Russian  Orthodox  Church 


A  chapel  built  in  1821  on  St.  Paul  Island 
was  dedicated  to  St.  Peter  the  Apostle.13  Like 
the  first  chapel  on  St.  George  Island,  it  was 
constructed  of  wood  rather  than  sod  (many  of 
the  dwellings  were  of  sod).  In  1840,  a  new  and 
larger  chapel  was  built  using  funds  provided  by 
the  Russian-American  Company.14 

In  1869,  two  years  after  the  cession 
of  Russian  America  to  the  United  States, 
President  Ulysses  S.  Grant  sent  Special  Indian 
Commissioner  Vincent  Colyer  to  the  Pribilof 
Islands.  Colyer’s  report  on  his  St.  Paul  Island 
visit  included  only  one  reference  to  the  church: 

The  priest,  who  officiates  in  a  neatly-built 
church,  receives  one  hundred  and  thirty  dollars 
per  annum.  He  is  not  in  orders,  and  hardly 
ranks  as  a  deacon  in  the  church.  The  priest  from 
Unalaska  occasionally  comes  up  and  administers 
the  sacrament.15 

The  first  full-time  priest  came  to  St.  Paul 
Island  in  1875.  Under  the  terms  of  a  20-year 
lease  awarded  by  the  U.S.  government  to  the 
Alaska  Commercial  Company  (ACC)  in  1870, 
the  ACC  had  the  right  to  harvest  100,000  fur 
seals  per  year  in  the  Pribilofs,  but  it  also  had 
responsibility  for  maintaining  the  welfare  of  the 
Aleut  residents.  In  1873,  the  ACC  began  efforts 
to  replace  the  Russian-American  Company 
chapel  at  St.  Paul  Island  with  a  church.  In  that 
regard  government  Agent  Charles  Bryant  wrote 
in  his  annual  report  dated  September  20,  1873: 


Saints  Peter  and  Paul  Church  (1875-1905), 
built  by  Hamden  McIntyre,  St.  Paul  Island, 
1890s.  (NAA,  Joseph  Stanley-Brown  Lantern 
Slide  Coll.,  lot  54-245.)

Coll.,  lot  54-405.) 


The  [Alaska  Commercial  Company]  steamer 
[Alexander]  also  brought  two  carpenters  from 
San  Francisco  to  frame  and  build  a  church  for  the 
natives,  the  people  of  both  Saint  Paul  and  Saint 
George  having  last  year  agreed  with  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company  to  furnish  the  materials 
and  a  part  of  the  labor  for  this  purpose,  to  pay  for 
which  a  fund  nearly  sufficient  has  been  already 
accumulated,  by  setting  aside  for  that  object  two 
first-class  shares  of  the  seal  fund  annually.  The 
materials  have  since  then  been  landed  on  the 
islands,  and  the  church  on  Saint  Paul  has  been 
raised  and  boarded,  and  will  be  completed  before 
another  year;  that  on  Saint  George  will  be  built 
during  the  ensuing  winter.16

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


The  company  apparently  sent  two  additional  carpenters,  Messrs.  Mossman  and 
Davidson,  from  San  Francisco  to  help  the  Natives  build  the  church.17  The  Church  of 
Saints  Peter  and  Paul  was  completed  in  1875.  How  much  the  ACC  contributed  to  the 
cost  is  unclear,  as  the  records  were  likely  among  those  lost  during  the  1906  San  Francisco 
earthquake,  but  much  of  the  cost  was  donated  by  the  St.  Paul  Island  Native  sealing  crew.ls 
Several  anecdotal  notes  about  the  church  were  found  in  government  agents’  logs,  ex¬ 
cerpted  here: 

June  29,  1876 
Church  Bells 

They  raised  the  nine  bells  to  the  Belfry  of  the  new  church  today.  They  went  up  as  nice  as 
a  pin,  the  largest  but  one  was  raised  at  just  half  past  ten  A.M.  We  stood  and  saw  it  go  up 
into  place  fast  and  easy  as  one  could  snatch  a  kiss.  The  bells  were  cast  in  Boston,  the  whole 

weight  of  the  nine. _ (illegible) _ lbs.  They  cost  here  some  $3,000  about  $1,000  was  for 

freight  &  percentage.  They  came  from  Philadelphia  by  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company's 
new  Steamer  St.  Paul  as  she  came  round  to  San  Francisco  to  run  on  this  line.  The  Co. 

Agents  had  told  us  all  winter  that  the  Alaska  Commercial  Co.  was  going  to  give  the  bells  to 
the  Church,  but  it  turns  out  to  be  a  near  relative  to  the  widows  Support  Stories.19 

May  20,  1877 
Church  Dedication 

The  new  Greek  Church  was  dedicated  today  by  Father  Euakenta  Shaisnekoff  of  Ounalaska 
assisted  by  Father  Paul  Shisnekoff  of  this  place.  Service  was  from  7:30  a.m.  to  12:30  p.m.  At 
the  close  of  the  services  Father  Euakenta  addressed  the  people  relative  to  an  order  of  the 
Treasury  Agent  prohibiting  the  manufacture  and  use  of  beer  on  the  two  islands. . . .  thanks 
were  extended  by  the  priest  on  the  part  of  the  people  to  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company 
for  the  interest  manifested  by  the  company  in  the  building  of  the  church.  Also,  to  Mr. 

Hamden  W.  McIntyre  the  architect  and  builder.  The  edifice  was  commenced  in  1873  and 
has  cost  the  people  $14,000.00.”2° 

The  buildings  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  are  exposed  to  harsh  weather,  and  all  the  build¬ 
ings  show  it.  The  1875  church  soon  required  replacement.  In  1905,  San  Francisco  architect 
Nathaniel  Blaisdell  began  work  on  the  island’s  fourth  place  of  worship.  The  design  did  not 
include  the  traditional  onion  domes.  On  August  14,  1907,  Bishop  Innocent  (Pustynsky) 
consecrated  the  new  church,  located  a  bit  north  of  the  church  it  was  replacing.21 

The  St.  Paul  church  endured  insults  similar  to  those  inflicted  on  the  St.  George 
church  during  WWII.  On  June  6,  1980,  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Interior  included 
Saint  George  the  Great  Martyr  Orthodox  Church  and  the  Church  of  Saints  Peter  and 
Paul  on  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places.  In  2001,  funds  made  available  by  the 
Aleutian  and  Pribilof  Islands  Restitution  Act  of  1988  led  to  the  full  restoration  of  the 
Church  of  Saints  Peter  and  Paul.  In  2007,  in  celebration  of  its  one  hundredth  year,  the  St. 
Paul  Island  community,  led  by  Father  Maxim  Isaac,  constructed  and  placed  a  traditional 
onion  dome  atop  the  church’s  bell  tower. 

In  1975,  community  leader  Agafon  Krukoff  Jr.  summarized  the  importance  of  the 
church  to  the  people  of  the  Pribilof  Islands: 

The  people  have  known  Christianity  all  their  lives,  as  did  their  forefathers.  During  the  hard 
years  of  dictatorial  rule  under  the  Russian  flag  and  continuing  under  the  American  flag,  the 
Orthodox  Church  gave  them  their  only  hope  for  freedom.  And  now,  nearly  200  years  later,

the  ugliest  of  the  hardships  are  gone;  the  Church 
to  them  has  proved  its  strength.  The  Orthodox 
Church  still  stands  and  with  a  full  congregation 
that  is  still  supported  by  the  whole  population  of 
St.  Paul  [and  St.  George].22 

The  Russian  Orthodox  faith  was  the  foun¬

Unaagin  during  their  lives  under  the  oppressive 
administrations  of  both  Russia  and  the  United

Pribilof  Islands  Clergy— St.  George  Island 


St.  George  Island  was  served  by  visiting  clergy  from  San  Francisco  or  Unalaska  until  1882, 
except  for  brief  intervals  during  transitions.  The  Agents’  Logs  would  typically  note  these 
visits,  for  example: 

On  the  29th  ultimo  [July  1872]  the  company’s  steamer  H.  M.  Hutchinson  touched  here, 
having  on  board  the  Rev.  Father  Nickoli,  who  attended  to  the  spiritual  wants  of  the  people 
and  performed  the  marriage  ceremony  for  eight  couples.23

Reverend  Father  Innokenty  Lestenkov  was  the  “son  of  the  manager  [Mikhail  Innokentovich 
Lestenkov]27  of  the  Russian-American  Company  post  at  Attu  Island.  He  first  entered 
church  service  in  1846  and  was  ordained  a  priest  in  1880.  He  served  Unalaska  until  his 
departure  for  St.  George  Island  where  he  arrived  on  October  3,  1882.  He  presided  as 
priest  at  the  Church  of  Saint  George  the  Victorious  until  his  death  in  1895.”28

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Newly  arrived  in  1893,  Treasury  Agent-in-Charge  Joseph  Crowley  ordered  Assistant 
Agent  Joseph  Murray  to  recognize  Rev.  Lestenkov’s  family  as  members  of  the  St.  George 
community.  Why  a  family  that  had  resided  on  the  island  since  1882  was  not  previously 
considered  part  of  the  community  is  unknown. 

The  family  of  Rev.  Innokenty  Lestenkoff  [sic]  shall  be  considered  as  a  family  of  natives, 
and  receive  supplies  accordingly.  His  son  Michael,  who  is  a  member  of  the  family,  shall  in 
the  matter  of  the  distribution  of  supplies  be  regarded  as  its  head,  and  orders  for  the  family 
supplies  shall  be  issued  to  him.  And  a  double  ration  of  coal  shall  be  issued  to  the  family  so 
long  as  sickness  prevails  therein  as  at  present.29 


1896-1898:  Father  Rafael  Kedrovsky 

Biographical  Sketch 

Father  Rafael  Kedrovsky  was  born  in  Russia.  According  to  church  historian  Barbara 
Sweetland  Smith,  Father  Kedrovsky  led  a  lonely  life  at  St.  George  Island.  Fearing  that  the 
residents  were  members  of  the  once  fearsome  Tlingit  tribe,  he  refused  to  eat  their  food, 
which  consisted  of  seal  meat  and  birds.  During  his  two-year  residency,  Father  Kedrovsky 
inventoried  the  church  furnishings;  his  foresight  provided  invaluable  information  about 
the  early  church  icons  and  other  items.  After  WWII  that  information  became  an  essential 
component  for  undertaking  the  church  restoration.30

Genealogy 

Father  Peter  Kashevarof,  Creole  son  of  Father 
Peter  Phillipov  Kashevarof,  was  born  at 
Kodiak,  Alaska,  in  1857.31  Peter  Kashevarof 
was  the  youngest  of  four  brothers,  the  others 
being  Andrew,  Nicholas,  and  Vasillii.

Peter  Kashevarof  served  as  a  deacon  at 
Belkofsky  for  twelve  years  before  being  or¬ 
dained  a  priest  in  1898  by  Bishop  Nicholas 
(Ziorov).  He  arrived  at  St.  George  Island  the 
same  year  and  remained  until  his  death  in 
1930.32

1932-1935:  Father  Stefon  (Stephan)  Shabanoff 
Biographical  Sketch 

Father  Stefon  Shabanoff  was  said  to  have  emigrated  from  Russia  by  way  of  China,  seeking 
political  asylum  after  the  Russian  Revolution  of  1917.  He  eventually  made  his  way  to  the 
United  States  and  arrived  at  St.  George  Island  on  February  11,  1932.  While  on  St.  George 
Island,  he  planned  to  replace  the  sixty-year-old  church  with  a  new  one.  During  a  visit  to 
Seattle  in  1935  to  purchase  materials  for  the  new  building,  Father  Stefon  was  transferred 
to  an  unknown  destination.33 

1935-1936:  Bishop  Alexii  (Alexay)  Panteleev 

Biographical  Sketch 

Alexander  Panteleev  was  born  in  Russia  and  ordained  a  priest  in  his  hometown  of  Velikii 
Ustiug,  Russia.  His  first  assignment  as  a  priest  was  at  Unalaska  in  1910-12.  While  in  the 
Aleutians,  he  traveled  extensively  and  became  fluent  in  the  Aleut  language.  After  serving 
as  Dean  of  the  Cathedral  at  Sitka  and  following  the  death  of  his  wife,  Father  Alexander 
took  monastic  vows  and  assumed  the  name  Alexii.  He  became  Bishop  of  San  Francisco  in 
1927,  and  was  named  the  Bishop  of  Alaska  in  the  mid-1930s.34 

During  the  winter  of  1935-36,  Bishop  Alexii  arrived  at  St.  George  Island  to  fill  the 
vacancy  left  by  the  departure  of  Father  Shabanoff.  Bishop  Alexii  departed  St.  George  for 
St.  Paul  Island  on  May  13,  1936,  after  consecrating  the  new  church.35  During  his  stay  on 
St.  George  he  wrote  music  with  lyrics  in  Aleut  for  various  Lenten  services,  and  he  tutored 
the  island  choir,  which  became  well-respected  throughout  the  diocese.36

1937-1961:  Archimandrite  Theodosy  (Theodosious)  Kulchitsky  (circa 
1885-1961) 

Biographical  Sketch 

Theodosy  Kulchitsky3"  emigrated  from  Russia  to  the  United  States  in  1909  at  the  age 
of  twenty-four  and  within  four  years  had  become  a  monk.  On  September  3,  1937,  “The 
Right  Rev.  Theodore  Kulschizky  [sic]  arrived  to  take  up  duties  as  Priest  for  St.  George 
Native  church.”38 

Theodosy  Kulchitsky  accompanied  the  St.  George  community  when  the  Native 
residents  were  evacuated  to  Funter  Bay  during  WWII.  The  Agent  and  Caretaker’s  1941 
Annual  Report  offered  the  following  observation: 

Father  Theodosy,  listed  with  ‘Visitors’,  is  not  an  actual  visitor,  since  he  is  priest  of  the 
Church  here  and  his  salary  is  paid  by  the  Native  Community.  It  just  goes  to  show,  as  Father 
Baranoff  once  said,  there  are  three  kinds  of  people  on  the  Pribilofs,  viz.  white  employees, 
natives  and  priests.  The  same  difficulty  of  listing  him  is  encountered  in  making  up  the 
Annual  Census,  where  he  is  simply  shown  separate  from  the  Natives  and  Government 
Employees,  with  no  heading.39 

Archimandrite  Theodosy  continued  to  serve  the  St.  George  community  until  his 
death  in  1961.  He  encouraged  several  well-respected  Aleut  men  to  become  church  lead¬ 
ers,  including  Father  Michael  Lestenkof,  Deacon  Father  Andronik  Kashevarof,  and  Father 
Paul  Merculief.40

Biographical  Sketch 

Elary  Stepetin  Gromoff  was  one  of  the  acknowledged  leaders  of  the  Pribilovians  during 
their  efforts  to  gain  access  to  their  inherent  civil  rights  in  the  1940s  and  1950s.  He  was 
revered  for  his  knowledge,  intelligence,  and  leadership  abilities.  Elary  Stepetin  Gromoff 
provided  community  leadership  along  with  his  brother  Gabriel  (Gabe)  Stepetin:  they 
became  the  first  president  and  vice-president,  respectively,  of  the  St.  Paul  Chapter  of  the 
Alaska  Native  Brotherhood.  Gromoff  later  became  one  of  the  first  members  of  the  Aleut 
Community  Council  on  St.  Paul.  He  participated  in  all  the  council  meetings  regarding 
the  Pribilovians’  freedom,  and  he  wrote  letters  pleading  with  the  government  for  better 
treatment  of  the  islands’  Natives. 

Elary  Stepetin  Gromoff  ran  the  Point  Warehouse,  a  storage  facility  for  government- 
owned  tools  and  other  supplies.  (The  warehouse  burned  down  in  the  late  1980s.)  He  also 
owned  the  only  ice  cream  shop  on  St.  Paul  Island  and  was  caretaker  of  one  of  the  island’s 
four  communal  camp  houses;  he  built  and  maintained  the  camp  house  at  Tasmania, 
along  St.  Paul’s  extreme  northwest  shoreline.  It  is  still,  in  2008,  the  most  remote  cabin  on 
the  island. 

The  Father  Elary  Stepetin  Gromoff  began  his  religious  vocation  of  forty-five  years 
as  a  reader  for  the  Church  of  Saints  Peter  and  Paul  on  St.  Paul  Island.  In  February  1970,

His  daughter  Zenia  (Zena)  founded  the 
fashionable  Zena  Jeans  line  of  clothing,  a  com¬ 
pany  that  is  still  thriving  today.  His  son  Elary 
Jr.,  from  a  second  marriage,  was  the  first  Alaska 
Native  to  enter  West  Point  Military  Academy56 
and  the  first  Native  American  to  graduate  from 
the  Academy.  One  of  Father  Gromoff’s  daugh¬ 
ters  became  a  flight  attendant  on  Pan  American 
World  Airways.  His  daughter,  Alexandra 
(Alice),  attended  New  York  University  and 
settled  in  Seattle  after  graduation.  She  married 
Augustine  Tu  and  the  couple  resided  near  Lake 
City,  Washington.

Biographical  Sketch 

Innokenty  trained  for  the  Orthodox  clergy  at  Atka  under  the  Reverend  Iakov  Netsvetov, 
and  became  the  first  Alaska  Native  to  become  a  priest.  Bishop  Innocent  (Veniaminov) 
ordained  Reverend  Father  Innokenty  in  1848  at  St.  Michael.  As  dean  of  the  Aleutian 
District,  Father  Innokenty  served  St.  Paul  Island  and  various  Aleutian  communities  from 
his  base  in  Unalaska.  He  is  credited  with  translating  numerous  church  texts  into  Aleut, 
including  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles,  which  was  initiated  by  Father  Andrew  Siztsov.63  He 
is  also  remembered  as  a  teacher  with  exceptional  musical  talent.  In  1844,  before  his  ap¬ 
pointment  as  dean,  he  accompanied  Father  Iakov  to  begin  a  mission  at  Yukon  in  Russian 
America  (Ft.  Yukon,  Alaska).64

Genealogy 

Father  Paul  (Pavel)  Shaiashnikov  [4]  was  the 
brother  of  Innokenty  Shaiashnikov  [2], 65  and 
was  born  June  29,  1835,  to  Deacon  Kass'ian 
Shaiashnikov  [1]  and  Nadezhda  (surname  un¬ 
known)  of  St.  Paul  Island. 

A  St.  Paul  Island  census  taken  on  January 
1,  1873,  offered  the  following  vital  data: 

Paval  Shiesneekov,  age  38 

Meesher  [Mishu],  his  son  age  13 

(June  1,  1873,  father  and  son  left  for  Ounalska 

on  a  visit)66 


Biographical  Sketch 

Father  Paul’s  father,  Kass’ian  Shaiashnikov,  was  a  Creole  who  served  as  chief  manager  of 
the  Pribilof  Islands  for  the  Russian-American  Company6'  and  is  credited  with  using  his 
own  funds  to  build  St.  Paul  Island’s  first  chapel  in  1821.68  In  1875,  after  completing  studies 
at  the  Cathedral  School  in  San  Francisco,  Father  Paul  became  the  first  resident  priest  at 
St.  Paul  Island  and  arrived  in  time  to  see  the  completion  of  the  island’s  first  church.69  He 
succeeded  his  brother,  Innokenty,  who  had  served  the  island  on  periodic  visits  from  his 
official  post  at  Unalaska.  Father  Paul  provided  dedicated  service  to  the  people  of  the  St. 
Paul  Island  Aleut  community  until  1893. 

The  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s  Log  recorded  the  arrival  of  the  Shaiashnikoff  brothers 
aboard  the  Alexander. 


Father  Innocent  Shaiashnikoff  Arch  Priest  of  the  Russian  Greek  Church  on  affairs  of 
business  connected  with  the  church.  Also,  Father  Paul  Shaiashnikoff  and  son  Mishu  who 
went  from  here  in  1872  to  San  Francisco  to  be  ordained  by  the  Bishop  there  and  qualified 
for  the  pastorate  of  this  island.70 

In  1892,  North  American  Commercial  Company  Agent  Joseph  Stanley-Brown  re¬ 
ported  his  own  personal  conflicts  with  what  he  saw  as  the  moral  perspectives  of  the 
church  and  of  Father  Paul  himself  (topics  such  as  finances,  marriage  or  lack  thereof,  and 
education)  as  regards  the  Pribilof  Islands  Natives.71  Stanley-Brown’s  report  may  or  may 
not  have  influenced  Father  Paul’s  replacement  the  next  year. 

The  Rev.  Paul  Shaiashnikoff  remained  a  resident  of  St.  Paul  Island  after  his  replace¬ 
ment’s  arrival  in  1893.  He  died  on  the  island  on  October  14,  1896. 

The  church  bell  was  tolled  during  his  departure,  a  custom  in  the  Greek  Church  when  a 
Priest  is  dying.72 

The  natives  made  a  coffin,  and  dug  the  grave  under  the  eaves  of  the  church  for  Father  Paul 
Shaiashnikoff.  They  took  the  body  to  the  church  at  5  o’clock  this  evening.  They  will  watch 
with  him  in  the  church  during  the  night,  and  bury  him  in  the  morning.73

1893-1901:  Reverend  Father  Nikolai  Rysev  (1829-1911) 

Genealogy 

Nikolai  Rysev  was  born  in  1829  at  Sitka,  Alaska.  He  was  the  son  of  Russian-born  Stefan 
Rysev  and  Natalia  Maliutin,  an  Aleut.  Father  Rysev  married  Marina  Tapkin  of  Sitka  in 
1851,  and  the  couple  had  ten  children.  Father  Rysev  died  at  age  eighty-two  on  August  19, 
1911.  He  is  buried  at  Holy  Ascension  Cathedral  Cemetery  at  Unalaska,  as  are  his  wife  and 
son  Ivan  Rysev.74 


Biographical  Sketch 

Nikolai  Rysev  worked  for  the  Russian-American  Company  at  Sitka  and  subsequently 
served  Russia  in  the  Crimean  War.  In  1873,  at  the  age  of  forty-four,  he  entered  the  clergy 
and  initially  served  as  a  reader  at  Kodiak.  Eight  years  later  he  was  ordained  a  priest.  In 
1893,  he  relocated  to  St.  Paul  Island  as  the  community’s  second  resident  priest;  he  served 
until  1901.  5  The  Paul  Island  Agent’s  Log  noted:  “Rev.  Resoff  and  family,  parish  priest  ar¬ 
rives,  August  21,  1893.”76 

On  September  18,  1897,  Joseph  Murray  recorded  in  the  Agent’s  Log: 


They  have  some  17  Holydays  of  Obligation  during  the  year,  which  they  like  to  observe  as 
they  do  the  Sabbath;  and  I  have  promised  to  allow  them  to  do  so  except  in  cases  when 
vessels  are  to  be  discharged  or  laden  to  which  they  have  agreed.  The  following  named  days 
are  those  which  are  to  be  kept  holy:

St.  Michael’s  Day 

Presentation  of  Virgin  Mary  to  the  Church

Easter:  Mid  Pentecost:  Ascension  Day:  Trinity  Sunday.77 


The  observance  of  these  holy  days  may  appear  silly  to  some  "Modern  Thinkers;”  but  it 
should  be  borne  in  mind  that  our  Native  people  are  still  very  far  behind  our  modern 
notions  of  doubt  and  disbelief  and  that  “Religion  to  them  is  a  reality  not  to  be  doubted,  or 
called  in  question,  under  any  circumstances.  But  off  from  the  world  of  modern  thought,  as 
they  are,  their  only  comfort  in  life  is  their  firm  belief  in  a  personal  God:  a  literal  heaven  and 
hell;  death,  and  resurrection  to  eternal  bliss— and  I  feel  it  to  be  best  to  enable  them  to  take 
all  the  comfort  they  can  out  of  such  belief  and  such  surroundings,  and  consequently  I  have 
promised  to  give  them  the  holidays  named.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Reverend  Father  Nikolai  started  a  Russian  Church  School  on  St.  Paul  Island  in  1898. 

The  following  letter  from  Rev.  Rysev  was  transcribed  by  the  Treasury  Agent-in-Charge, 

Joseph  Murray,  into  his  log: 

St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska 
May  9th,  1898 
Mr.  Joseph  Murray 
U.S.  Treasury  Agent 

Dear  Sir:  In  accordance  with  your  request  that  I  explain  my  position  on  the  question  of  the 
proposed  Russian  School  on  St.  Paul  Island,  I  will  say  that  my  ecclesiastical  superior,  Rev. 

Alexander  Kedroosky  of  Unalaska  district,  has  instructed  me  to  open  a  Russian  School,  to 
be  opened  daily,  from  the  closing  of  the  Public  School  in  May  to  its  opening  in  September.  I 
herewith  enclose  a  list  of  the  daily  lessons  to  be  taught  in  the  Russian  School. 

Very  Respectfully, 

N.S.  Rysev 

Priest  of  S.  Paul  Island  Russ.  Church 

Reverend  Father  Nikolai  included  his  list  of  proposed  daily  exercises.  Reverend 
Nikolai  mentioned  about  five  months  of  church  schooling,  whereas  Agent  Murray  or  his 
assistant  penned  “for  eight  months.”78 

On  May  15,  1898,  Agent  Murray  replied  to  Reverend  Nikolai’s  request: 

Rev.  Nicoli  S.  Reesef. 

Dear  Sir:  In  reply  to  your  favor  of  the  9th  inst.  in  which  you  inform  me  that  your 
“Ecclesiastical  Superior”  at  Unalaska  has  instructed  you  to  open  a  Russian  School  on  St. 

Paul  Island  “from  the  closing  of  the  Public  School  in  May  to  its  opening  in  September;”  I 
have  to  say  that  no  school  can  be  opened,  or  held,  for  any  purpose  during  the  period  set 
apart  by  the  United  States  Government  for  vacation  for  the  children,  after  their  attendance 
at  the  Public  School  during  the  presiding  eight  months. 

You  will  remember  that  he  [Eminence  Nicholis,  Bishop  of  Alaska]  asked,  as  a  favor,  that 
the  priest  be  allowed  to  teach  the  gospel  in  the  Public  School  building,  on  Saturdays  and 
Sundays;  and  that  both  the  Treasury  Agent  and  the  Superintendent  of  the  Company  agreed 
to  have  it  so;  but  then  you  tell  us  you  have  been  instructed  to  open  a  “Russian”  School, 
six  days  per  week  for  eight  months  of  the  year  [the  log  book  has  an  entry  in  the  margin 
indicating  "eight”  should  read  "four”  months];  and  you  [word  illegible]  use  a  list  of  daily 
exercises  for  thirty  hours  per  week,  out  of  which  four  hours  only  are  to  be  given  to  the 
study  of  the  English  language. 

The  Bishop  complained  of  nothing  except  the  want  of  time  in  which  to  impart  religious 
instruction  to  the  children;  and  he  asked  that  two  days — Saturday  and  Sunday — be  given  up 
for  that  purpose  and  it  was  done. 

The  latest  instructions  received  from  the  government  is  that:  “None  but  English  language 
shall  be  taught  in  the  Schools.”  Yet  in  spite  of  the  regulation,  Rev.  Kodrovsky  orders  you  to 
open  a  “Russian”  School  for  eight  months  and  to  confine  the  children  there  every  day  of  the 
week;  thus  making  it  impossible  for  them  to  have  a  single  day’s  exercise  during  the  year! 

There  is  no  desire  on  the  part  of  the  United  States  or  its  Agents  to  meddle  with  the 
doctrines  or  dogmas  of  any  Church,  or,  in  any  manner,  to  abridge  the  rights  of  the  people  in 
their  mode  of  worship,  but  on  the  other  hand,  no  Church  can  be  allowed  to  interfere  with 
the  laws  of  Congress  or  with  the  regulations  of  the  Department  governing  the  Seal  Islands. 

Personally,  I  respectfully  suggest  that  your  Church  Ritual,  Catechism,  and  books  of 
religious  instruction  generally  prepared  for  School  Children,  be  printed  in  English  and 
introduced  into  the  Public  Schools  on  both  the  Seal  Islands;  thus  doing  away  with  the  last 
and  only  serious  cause  of  consternation  between  the  priests  and  the  Treasury  Agents.79

John  Zlobin  began  his  religious  vocation  as  a  missionary  to  Canada  in  1910.  In  Canada, 
he  became  a  tonsured  monk,  and  an  ordained  priest  the  following  year.  He  went  on  to 
serve  several  parishes  in  Canada  and  the  United  States.  By  1929,  when  he  arrived  at  St. 
Paul  Island,  Father  Zlobin  had  been  elevated  to  the  rank  of  Archimandrite.  After  leaving 
St.  Paul  in  1936,  he  moved  to  Sitka,  where  he  served  the  church  as  an  administrator  for 
the  parishes  of  Alaska.  Archimandrite  Zlobin  was  consecrated  Bishop  of  Alaska  in  1946. 
He  remained  in  that  position  until  his  1954  retirement.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Biographical  Sketch 

Michael  Dimitrovich  Lestenkof,  the  seventh 
child  of  Dimitri  Lestenkov  (Atka)  and  Alexandra 
Tetov  (St.  Paul  Island),  was  born  on  October  13, 
1913,  and  claimed  the  number  13  as  his  lucky 
number.  His  father,  Dimitri,  was  the  eldest  son  of 
the  Reverend  Father  Innokenty  Lestenkov,  who 
served  St.  George  Island  in  the  late  nineteenth 
century.  An  employee  of  the  Alaska  Commercial 
Company  at  Unalaska,  Dimitri  moved  to  St. 
George  in  1884  at  the  request  of  his  father  and 
was  ordained  a  church  reader.91 

Reverend  Father  Michael  was  of  the  first 
generation  of  Lestenkofs  born  on  the  Pribilof 
Islands.  Not  knowing  whether  he  was  born  at 
the  thirteenth  hour,  he  sometimes  threw  it  in 
for  the  story.  He  would  also  say  it  was  a  Friday, 
but  this  was  just  in  jest.  It  is  no  wonder,  says  his 
family,  that  he  would  be  done  visiting  this  land 
( tanaadaqadalix )  on  the  eleventh  day  at  the  eleventh  hour:  11:00  a.m.,  July  11,  2003.  Or 
was  this  so  he  would  be  buried  on  the  thirteenth  day  of  July?  (Church  tradition  requires 
that  the  deceased  be  buried  on  the  third  day,  or  July  13  in  Father  Michael’s  case.)  One  of 
his  favorite  sayings  was  from  the  funeral  liturgy,  “The  Earth  is  the  Lord’s;  the  round  world, 
its  fullness  and  all  that  dwell  therein.”  His  flock  found  significant  lessons  in  the  way  Rev. 
Father  Michael  marked  time’s  passages,  whether  humorous,  humbling,  or  profound.  His 
childhood  nickname  “ Lakuchax ”  translates  as  little  boy,  but  Michael  and  Stefanida  grew 
up  to  become  “Father”  and  “Matushka”  of  the  Pribilof  Islands’  Orthodox  Church.  Father 
Michael  favored  sayings  such  as,  “What  you  are  is  God’s  gift  to  you;  What  you  make  of 
yourself  is  your  gift  to  God”  and  “God  is  Time  and  Time  is  God.”

Johnston,  neg.  1981.  NOAA,  NMML 
Library,  Seattle,  WA.) 


About  five  years  after  he  was  born  on  St.  George  Island,  Lakuchax  had  a  vision. 
Awakened  from  sleep,  he  saw  an  iconostasis  (partition  or  screen,  decorated  with  icons, 
separating  the  sanctuary  from  the  rest  of  the  church)  in  the  bedroom.  Glancing  around  at 
his  still  sleeping  brothers,  he  got  out  of  bed,  walked  up  to  the  apparition  and  touched  it. 
A  bit  frightened  by  the  fact  that  he  could  feel  it,  he  jumped  back  in  bed.  Peering  out  from 
behind  a  blanket,  Lakuchax  could  still  see  the  iconostasis  there  in  his  bedroom. 

Many  years  later,  Michael  came  to  believe  that  this  vision  was  intended  to  let  him 
know  what  to  make  of  himself.  According  to  “These  Truths  We  Hold:  The  Holy  Orthodox 
Church,  Her  Life  and  Teachings,”  (Compiled  and  Edited  by  A  Monk  of  St.  Tikhon’s 
Monastery,  South  Canaan,  PA:  St.  Tikhon’s  Seminary  Press,  1986)  the  iconostasis  ex¬ 
presses  the  boundary  between  two  worlds,  the  Divine  and  the  human,  the  permanent 
and  the  transitory.  It  divides  the  two  worlds  but  also  unites  them  into  one  whole — a  place 
where  all  separation  is  overcome  and  where  reconciliation  between  God  and  man  is

achieved.  Lakuchax  began  his  service  in  1963  as 
an  Orthodox  priest  on  St.  George  Island  like  his 
grandfather  Innokenti,  the  first  Lestenkov  to  live 
on  St.  George.  In  1964,  Reverend  Father  Michael 
transferred  to  St.  Paul  Island.92 

Guided  by  an  awareness  that  time  is  not  to 
be  contended  with,  Reverend  Father  Michael 
lived,  accepted,  and  trusted  it  as  part  of  a  greater 
plan.  With  patience,  love,  and  humor,  he  helped 
bring  God  to  a  people  who  needed  to  get  through 
an  era  of  difficulty  and  change.  He  retired  from 
serving  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  1985  and  moved  to 
Seattle,  but  returned  to  St.  Paul  in  1997. 

For  forty  years  of  faithful  service  to  the 
Russian  Orthodox  Church,  Reverend  Father 
Michael  was  awarded  the  Jeweled  Cross.  Bishop 
Nikolai,  Diocese  of  Alaska,  made  arrangements 
to  present  the  award  to  Reverend  Father  Michael 
during  the  celebration  of  St.  Peter  and  St.  Paul’s 
Day  on  July  12,  2003.  The  Bishop  was  to  arrive  at 
St.  Paul  on  July  11,  but  his  flight  was  canceled  be¬ 
cause  of  mechanical  problems.  Reverend  Father  Michael  and  Stefanida  Lestenkof

Michael  died  that  day.  He  might  have  said  to  his 

people,  some  of  whom  also  now  rest  on  St.  Paul  Island,  that  he  had  already  received  his 
award.  It  was  the  gift  of  Memory  Eternal. 

When  he  was  six  years  old,  Lakuchax  lost  the  middle  finger  of  his  left  hand  while  play¬ 
ing  with  a  conveyor  belt  system  that  was  used  to  haul  rock  up  from  the  St.  Paul  Island 
shore  to  a  crusher.  Reverend  Father  Michael  often  told  the  story  of  his  sister  Elizabeth 
carrying  him  to  the  homes  of  people  who  would  feel  sorry  for  him  and  give  him  candy, 
which  he  then  had  to  share  with  his  sister. 

In  1929,  at  the  age  of  16,  he  was  sent  to  work  for  a  time  on  St.  Paul  Island.  He  recalled 
staying  at  Northeast  Point  during  the  commercial  seal  harvest.  He  told  of  a  time  when 
the  sealers  hauled  bundles  of  fur-seal  pelts  on  their  backs  from  the  killing  grounds  near 
Webster’s  house  on  the  eastern  end  of  the  island  to  the  western  side  of  Big  Lake.  At  Big 
Lake,  a  new  railcar  system  was  to  haul  them  back  into  the  village.  However,  the  railcar  did 
not  work,  so  the  men  had  to  haul  the  skins  all  the  way  back  to  the  Webster  House  area 
where  there  was  a  salt  house.  From  that  location,  they  would  haul  the  sealskins  by  sea  in 
nigalan  [open  skin  boats]  back  into  the  village. 

In  1959,  Michael  Lestenkof  received  his  30-year  pin  for  service  to  the  U.S.  govern¬ 
ment.

A  self-motivated  and  independent  man,  Michael  Lestenkof  also  started  his  own  busi¬ 
ness  on  the  islands,  first  on  St.  George  and  then  on  St.  Paul.  Just  how  this  business  first 
came  about  is  uncertain,  but  Chinese  men  worked  as  cooks  on  the  islands  at  various 
times,  and  the  male  fur-seal  penis  bone  (baculum)  or  “stick”  had  become  a  sought-after 
aphrodisiac  in  China.  The  general  scheme  operated  as  follows:  an  island  Native  agent 
with  access  to  the  killed  seals  would  hire  young  boys  to  collect  the  sticks.  Only  boys  seen 
as  honest  were  chosen,  as  not  all  were  considered  completely  honest.  The  Native  agent 
(in  this  case,  Michael  Lestenkof)  would  take  the  boys  to  breakfast  at  the  island  mess  just 
after  the  sealers  left  for  the  killing  field.93  After  breakfast  the  agent  transported  the  boys 
to  the  killing  field  where  they  waited  until  the  sealers  drove  the  seals  to  the  field  and  killed 
and  skinned  them.  The  boys  would  then  cut  the  “sticks”  from  the  male  carcasses  and  store 
them  in  a  bag.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  daily  harvest,  the  agent  would  drive  the  boys  back 
to  the  village  where  they  counted  and  deposited  their  sticks  through  a  hole  in  a  bin,  one 
hole  for  each  boy.  The  agent  then  collected  the  sticks  and  tacked  them  or  hung  them  over 
a  line  to  dry.  He  then  arranged  to  sell  the  dried  sticks  to  a  broker,  usually  in  San  Francisco 
or  Seattle.  The  broker  paid  the  agent  and  the  agent  paid  the  boys.  Prices  paid  to  the  boys 
varied  with  demand  and  quality  but  normally  ranged  between  ten  and  twenty-five  cents. 

About  1960,  Michael  and  his  wife,  Stefanida,  were  asked  by  the  community  of  St. 
George  if  he  was  ready  to  become  a  priest.  The  first  time,  he  said  “yes”  and  she  said  “no,” 
so  he  was  not  ordained.  They  were  asked  a  second  time,  and  this  time  both  answered, 
“Yes.”  They  said  they  had  talked  about  it  in  great  depth,  about  how  their  lives  and  their

friendships  would  change.  They  claimed  they  never  regretted  the  decision.  Michael  was 
ordained  in  1963  in  the  Sitka  Cathedral.  Stefanida  was  the  force  behind  him,  he  said; 
everything  about  his  “presentation”  to  his  flock  was  of  her  doing.  She  loved  to  cook  and 
bake  and  she  was  good  at  it.  They  had  a  brand  new  brick  home,  but  when  they  became 
Father  and  Matushka,  they  had  to  vacate  the  house  and  move  into  the  priest’s  house. 
Matushka  was  not  too  happy  about  leaving  a  brand  new  home  for  an  old  one. 

In  later  life  Reverend  Father  Michael  would  say,  “I  was  a  rugged  working  man.”  He 
helped  to  build  the  first  plank  roads  on  St.  George  Island.  His  first  carpentry  effort  was 
for  what  is  presently  [2006]  the  fire  house  at  St.  George.  It  was  his  family’s  first  home.  He 
built  steps  to  a  second  story  that  a  visitor  said  must  have  been  “built  for  cows,”  because 
they  were  huge  and  made  of  such  thick  wood.  (The  visitor  was  probably  Christopher 
Malavansky.)  After  that  Father  Michael  probably  remodeled  every  home  he  lived  in. 

When  they  were  transferred  to  St.  Paul  Island  in  August  of  1964  they  found  the  priest’s 
house  a  dark,  dingy  place  that  “only  a  monk  would  live  in,”  Matushka  said.  Remodeling 
took  place  “to  make  it  a  home.”

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


“When  I  came  to  the  community  of  St.  Paul,  I  spent  the  first  year  getting  to  know  it; 
getting  to  know  how  people  did  things,  Reverend  Father  Michael  said.  He  served  for  21 
years,  until  September  of  1985.  Reverend  Father  Michael  was  one  of  the  few  bilingual 
(English  and  Aleut)  teachers94  at  St.  Paul  School,  where  he  taught  for  about  five  years, 
from  1974  until  1979.  He  also  worked  as  a  hardware  clerk  to  earn  enough  hours  for  a 
retirement  pension  from  the  federal  government. 

On  June  13,  1985,  Reverend  Father  Lestenkof  testified  during  hearings  before 
the  Senate  Committee  on  Foreign  Relations  to  amend  the  Interim  Convention  on 
Conservation  of  North  Pacific  Fur  Seals  Between  the  United  States,  Canada,  Japan,  and 
the  Soviet  Union  (99th  Congress,  Senate  Hearing  99-218,  Treaty  Doc.  99-5). 95 


Assembly  of  God  Church 

Purportedly,  an  Alaska  Assembly  of 
God  Mission  Church  was  the  only  other 
Christian  church  to  root  itself  at  the  Pribilof 
Islands.  Government  Island  Manager  H. 
Euneau  wrote  in  his  1965  Sealing  Report  on 
December  22,  “a  minister  from  a  Protestant 
church  did  visit  St.  Paul  Island  during  this 
year.  No  development  has  resulted  from 
this  visit  as  yet.”  The  next  year  a  church 
building,  relatively  small  in  dimensions, 
stood  near  the  corner  of  Bartlett  Boulevard 
and  Airport  Road.  A  parsonage  was  also 
built.  Several  members  of  the  St.  Paul  com¬ 
munity  attended  the  new  church,  wheth¬ 
er  out  of  curiosity  or  a  real  desire  to  find  a  satisfactory  alternative  is  not  known.  The 
Unaagin  community  never  embraced  the  alternative  faith,  but  the  Assembly  of  God  did 
provide  a  place  of  worship  for  visitors,  transients,  and  some  Coast  Guardsmen  on  St.  Paul 
Island.  In  the  late  1990s,  Minister  Alvin  Capener  died  on  St.  Paul  Island.  His  wife,  Lillian 
Capener,  maintained  a  bed  and  breakfast  in  the  parsonage  until  her  death  circa  2007. 
The  Assembly  of  God  ministry  continued  to  serve  Coast  Guardsmen  and  transients  into 
2009.  The  church  building  went  into  disrepair  following  the  passing  of  Rev.  Capener.  In 
2008,  the  church  roof  collapsed,  but  a  visiting  minister  continued  to  provide  services  in 
the  parsonage.

1  Over  the  years,  the  literature  described  the  Russian  Orthodox  faith  variously:  Greek  Christian 
(David  Hunter  Miller,  The  Alaska  Treaty,  Kingston,  ON:  Limestone  Press,  1981,  209);  Greek 
Catholic  (Elliott,  Report  on  the  Prybilov  Group  or  Seal  Islands,  Alaska,  Washington,  DC:  GPO,  1873,

Pavel  Golovin,  sent  by  Imperial  Russia  to  inspect  conditions  within  the  Russian-American  Company 
colony  in  1861,  offered  his  opinion  about  Aleuts  and  their  faith:  “It  is  true  that  the  Aleuts  accepted 
Christianity  and  tried  to  go  to  church  and  diligently  attempted  to  fulfill  their  religious  obliga¬

who  have  a  good  understanding  of  the  Aleuts  feel  that  they  would  become  ardent  Mohammedans 
tomorrow,  if  the  government  ordered  them  to  do  so.  The  deeds  of  the  first  Russian  promyshlen-

War  II  (Anchorage,  AI<:  Aleutian/Pribilof  Islands  Assoc.,  1994,  53),  stated  that  the  1833  chapel  was 
made  of  driftwood,  whereas  Veniaminov,  Notes  on  the  Islands,  238,  wrote  that  it  was  made  of  wood, 
suggesting  that  possibly  rough-sawn  wood  was  brought  to  the  island  by  the  Russian-American 
Company  for  that  purpose.

construction  were,  in  part,  “raised  through  the  community  Canteen.”  Smith  and  Petrivelli  (55)  also 
noted  that  Bishop  Alexii  (Panteleev)  consecrated  the  church  on  May  10,  1936,  and  stayed  on  for  an¬ 
other  two  years  to  serve  the  community;  Smith,  The  Church  of  the  Holy  Great  Martyr,  13,  stated  that 
Bishop  Alexii  remained  at  St.  George  for  only  seven  months,  32;  whereas  the  agent’s  Official  Journal

of  its  clergy.  Deacons  hold  rank  in  the  Priesthood,  and  are  not  laymen.  Deacons  are  addressed  as 
“Father”  or  “Deacon  Father.”  Priests  are  also  addressd  informally  as  “Father.”  In  a  formal  address, 
married  Orthodox  Priests  are  addressed  as  “The  Reverend  Father.”  The  wife  of  a  Priest  “in  a  sense 
shares  her  husband’s  priesthood.”  The  Russian  title  “Matushka  (Ma-toosh-ka)  is  applied  in  Western 
societies  to  the  Priest’s  wife.  When  greeted  personally,  Bishops  are  addressed  as  “Your  Grace.”  “Your 
Eminence”  is  the  proper  title  for  Bishops  with  suffragans  or  assistant  Bishops,  Metropolitans,  and 
most  Archbishops.  Otherwise,  Bishops  are  addressed  as  “The  Right  Reverend  Bishop,”  followed  by 
their  first  name.  Archbishops,  Metropolitans,  and  Patriarchs  are  addressed  as  “The  Most  Reverend 
Archbishop”  (“Metropolitan,”  or  “Patriarch”).  An  Archimandrite  (the  highest  monastic  rank  below

Ascension  Cathedral  at  Unalaska,  Alaska.  (Anchorage:  Aleutian-Pribilof  Islands  Trust,  1997),  318;

52  Anna  Stepetin’s  birth  year  is  suspect  as  it  appears  as  both  1871  and  as  1879  in  numerous  St.  Paul 
Island  census  records.  The  date  “February  13”  and  the  place  of  birth,  “Unalaska,”  are  not  in  doubt.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


The  St.  Paul  Island  census  years  from  1890  to  1913  note  Anna’s  age  alone  without  giving  her  birth 
year.  Applying  simple  subtraction  one  is  led  to  infer  that  her  birth  year  is  circa  1871.  In  1914,  the 
1914  census  overlapped  with  the  Pribilof  Islands  Native  name  standardization  process  (see  Lindsay 
and  Lindsay,  Genealogy  and  Census,  2009,  3-4).  Treasury  Agent  Henry  C.  Fassett  transcribed 
information  from  church  handwritten  records.  He  wrote  Anna’s  birth  year  as  1879.  The  birth  year 
“1879”  appeared  in  the  census  records  from  1914  until  1925  when  Anna’s  birth  year  was  given  as 
"1871.”  The  1871  date  continued  to  be  applied  through  subsequent  years  (see  Lindsay  and  Lindsay, 
Genealogy  and  Census,  2009).  The  authors  believe  the  “1871”  birth  year  is  correct,  especially  when 
one  compares  it  to  the  birth  year  of  her  first  child,  Ouliana,  born  in  1887.  It  seems  reasonable  to 
conclude  that  Agent  Fassett  erred  in  his  original  transcription  in  1914.

61  Kass’ian  spelling  is  taken  from  Smith,  The  Church  of  the  Holy  Apostles,  27.  Richard  A.  Pierce,  Russian 
America,  451,  spelled  it  Kas’ian.  Fredericka  Martin  spelled  it  Kaysan.  Kass’ian’s  son,  Innokenty 
served  the  Pribilof  Islands  periodically  from  Unalaska. 

62  Pierce,  Russian  America,  451-2,  is  the  source  for  Shaiashnikov  family  genealogy.  Ray  Hudson,  ed., 
People  of  the  Aleutian  Islands  (Unalaska:  Unalaska  City  School  District,  1986),  100,  stated  that 
the  couple  had  nine  children;  Nikolai  was  not  among  those  listed  by  Pierce.  Pierce  stated  that  Petr 
Shaiashnikov  died  in  1965  at  110  years  of  age.  The  author’s  search  of  census  records  from  Unalaska 
and  Alaska  could  not  support  the  1965  date  and  suggest  that  1865  may  be  a  more  accurate  date.

80  Smith,  The  Church  of  the  Holy  Apostles,  29,  provided  most  of  Rev.  Orloff’s  biography. 

81  Oleksa,  Orthodox  Alaska,  196.  As  an  interesting  anecdote,  in  1912  Native  Chief  Nicoli  Gromoff  and 
the  sealers  decided  that  the  priest,  Fr.  Orlov,  should  receive  $350  as  his  “first  class  share”  of  the  seal 
revenue  funding  allotment  distributed  among  the  community,  plus  an  additional  $160  from  the  gov¬ 
ernment  appropriation  to  support  the  community.  The  first  class  share  represented  an  increase  from 
the  $250  share  previously  given  to  the  priest.  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s  Log,  Feb.  16,  1912. 

82  A  photo  of  Marcia,  Margaret,  and  Alexander  Melovidoff  along  with  Nadesda  and  Nicoli  Orloff  was 
printed  in  The  Washington  Post,  Nov.  11,  1890.  The  quality  of  the  image  was  too  poor  for  repro¬ 
duction  here.  The  name  “Nadesda”  belonged  to  the  deceased  mother  of  the  Orloff  children.  These 
authors  offer  no  explanation  for  “Nadesda”  being  given  as  the  pictured  girl’s  name,  but  we  suggest 
the  child’s  name  was  likely  Nadia. 

83  Smith,  The  Church  of  the  Holy  Apostles,  29,  is  the  source  of  information  about  Father  Kochergin.

88  Ibid.,  31,  is  the  source  of  the  biographical  information  about  Father  Baranov.  Note:  Smith  spells 
Baranov’s  given  name  as  both  “Markary”  and  "Makary.”  We  have  elected  to  spell  the  name  as 
“Makary,”  whereas  Lindsay,  Rappaport,  and  Lindsay,  Pribilof  Islands,  Alaska:  Guide  to  Photographs 
and  Illustrations  spelled  the  name  as  “Markary.”

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Cutter  Service  on  April  26,  1872,  at  New  York,  and  by  June  22,  1889,  served  as  Inspector 
of  Life-Saving  Stations  at  New  York. 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Captain  Charles  Abbey  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  April  8,  1892,  at 
Washington  D.C.,  before  Notary  Public  Sevellon  A.  Brown: 

I  am  51  years  of  age,  and  am  Captain  in  the  Revenue  Marine  . . .  and  have  been  in  the 
service  for  nearly  twenty-eight  years.  From  June  1886,  until  the  latter  part  of  August  1886, 

I  was  in  charge  of  the  revenue  steamer  Corwin,  cruising  in  Bering  Sea  for  the  purpose  of 
protecting  seal  life,  the  fur-seal  industry,  and  the  Government  interests  in  Alaska  generally. 

On  June  10,  1886, 1  left  the  Columbia  River,  proceeding  to  Unalaska  . . .  and  thence  . . .  the 
Pribilof,  or  Seal  Islands.  Soon  after  leaving  Unalaska  we  began  to  see  seals  in  the  water 
about  the  steamer.  Within  seven  hours  after  leaving  Unalaska  I  sighted  the  schooner  Sierra, 
of  and  from  San  Francisco,  with  her  boats  out  sealing. . . .  Before  I  could  overhaul  her  boats 
were  called  in  and  all  evidences  of  sealing  were  out  of  sight.  There  were  seal  skins  in  her 
hold;  but  as  there  was  no  evidence  that  any  had  been  taken  in  Bering  Sea,  I  disarmed  her, 
she  being  without  a  permit  for  use  of  arms  and  ammunition,  I  let  her  go.  The  next  morning 
sighted  the  schooner  City  of  San  Diego,  of  San  Francisco. ...  As  she  also  had  no  permit  for 
arms  and  ammunition,  I  disarmed  her. 

I  then  called  at  the  Pribilof  Islands  and  cruised  about  them  for  some  days  without  seeing 
any  vessels  of  any  kind. . . .  returning  to  St.  Paul ...  it  was  very  difficult  to  find  the  island 
because  of  the  dense  fog  . . .  thence  went  easterly  along  the  Aleutian  Islands.  On  the  17th 
seized  the  schooner  San  Diego,  of  and  from  San  Francisco  . . .  She  had  577  seal  skins  on 
board,  and  the  captain  confessed  to  having  taken  seals  in  Bering  Sea.  I  took  her  to  Unalaska 
that  night. 

On  August  1st  I  seized  a  boat  containing  three  men  and  eight  dead  seals.  Proceeding 
southeasterly,  seized  another  boat  with  men  and  several  dead  seals  on  board.  Seized  the 
schooner  Thornton,  of  and  from  Victoria,  British  Columbia.  The  two  [smaller]  boats 
seized  belonged  to  the  Thornton.  The  same  evening  seized  the  schooner  Carolena,  of 
Victoria  . . .  Half  an  hour  later  seized  four  boats  belonging  to  the  Carolena  with  dead  seals 
on  board.  That  night  spoke  [sic]  schooner  Twilight,  sealing,  but  the  captain  stated  they  had 
taken  no  seals  in  Bering  Sea,  and  on  account  of  the  schooners  I  had  in  tow  I  was  unable  to 
overhaul  her. 

The  next  morning  at  4:10  sighted  a  schooner,  evidently  a  sealer,  but  was  unable  to  pursue 
her,  owing  to  the  fact  of  having  the  Thornton  and  Carolena  in  tow.  At  4:40  a.m.  spoke 
the  schooner  Onward,  of  Victoria. . . .  The  master  acknowledged  he  had  been  sealing  in 
Bering  Sea.  Boarding  her  and  finding  seal  skins  and  unskinned  dead  seals  on  board,  I 
seized  her  and  took  her  also  in  tow.  At  7:20  a.  m.  sighted  another  schooner,  but  she  fled, 
and  outsailed  us.  At  1 1  a.m.,  sighted  a  schooner  under  shortened  sail.  She  at  once  changed 
her  course  and  made  all  sail  southeast  and  escaped.  Reached  Unalaska  that  night.  The 
Thornton  had  on  board  four  rifles  and  six  shotguns;  the  Onward,  one  rifle  and  thirteen 
shotguns;  the  Carolena,  four  rifles,  one  musket,  and  five  shotguns.  Altogether,  the  vessels 
I  seized  had  over  2,000  seal  skins.  My  orders  made  no  distinction  as  to  seizing  English  or 
American  vessels,  and  each  vessel  seized  received  the  same  treatment  without  relation  to 
the  nationality  of  its  crew  or  owner.  Fogs  are  almost  constant  in  Bering  Sea  in  the  summer 
time.  During  the  fifty-eight  days  I  cruised  in  those  waters  fifty-four  days  were  foggy  or 
rainy,  the  other  four  days  being  partly  clear.  The  reports  of  the  guns  of  the  hunters  might 
often  be  heard  when  no  vessel  could  be  seen. 

The  following  statements  here  made  in  relation  to  open-sea  sealing  are  based  upon  my  own 
observation,  and  also  upon  information  I  received  from  conversations  with  forty  or  fifty 
men  engaged  in  open-sea  sealing  in  Bering  Sea.  The  average  size  of  the  sealing  vessels  is 
from  25  to  50  tons,  and  the  number  of  the  crew  varies  from  10  to  20  or  25.  A  vessel  is  fitted

out  with  about  4  to  6  boats,  or  6  or  8  canoes.  The  white  hunters  used  either  a  Winchester 
rifle  or  a  double-barreled  shotgun,  and  a  gaff  with  a  shaft  4  or  5  feet  long.  The  Indians  use 
a  toggle-headed  spear,  with  a  shaft  7  or  8  feet  in  length.  Each  boat  has  a  rower  and  one  or 
two  hunters,  and  is  also  provided  with  a  compass,  small  amount  of  provisions,  ammunition 
locker,  seal  knives,  and  a  short  club.  The  boats,  on  being  lowered  from  the  vessel,  provided 
the  water  is  fairly  smooth,  go  toward  all  points  of  the  compass,  and  I  have  found  them  as 
far  as  6  miles  from  the  schooner. 

The  white  hunter  in  a  boat,  when  a  seal  appears  on  the  surface,  if  within  50  yards,  fires  at 
it.  If  killed  outright,  the  seal  immediately  sinks,  and  the  boat  is  rowed  for  the  place  where 
it  sank;  but  I  do  not  think  they  recover  many  seals  thus  killed,  and  every  sealer  stated  that 
they  seldom  expected  to  get  a  seal  when  killed  outright.  It  is  almost  impracticable  to  take 
a  seal  in  the  water  unless  it  is  wounded  so  that  it  is  stunned,  when  it  goes  into  a  “flurry,” 
similar  to  that  of  a  whale  when  it  is  wounded.  The  boat  then  being  pulled  alongside,  the  seal 
is  gaffed  and  dragged  into  it.  The  skill  of  the  hunter  has  a  great  deal  to  do  with  the  number 
of  seals  secured  of  those  killed  or  wounded,  but  the  most  expert  does  not  get  more  than 
half  he  hits  and  the  average  for  hunters  in  general  would  be  about  three  in  ten. . . .  the  seal 
hunter  shoots  every  kind  of  seal  he  sees.4 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Captain  Abbey  confiscated  five  pirate-sealing  vessels  during  the  1886  sealing  season.  The 
New  York  Times  reported  on  Abbey’s  triumph  that  year. 

Capt.  Abbey  up  till  last  spring  served  on  the  Atlantic  coast,  having  been  in  command  upon 
nearly  every  station  on  the  coast  from  Maine  to  Florida.  He  was  commanding  the  U.S. 

Grant  [USS  Grant ]  at  New  York  when  he  was  ordered  to  take  the  Corwin  on  last  summer’s 
hunt  for  seal  pirates,  to  protect  the  seal  fisheries  and  the  Government  interests  in  Alaska 
generally.5 

When  asked  by  a  representative  of  the  New  York  Times,  “What  condition  of  affairs 
made  it  necessary  that  you  should  be  sent  on  this  northern  cruise?”  Abbey  replied: 

The  Government  was  confronted  with  the  pressing  necessity  of  protecting  the  seal  upon 
and  around  the  Pribylof  or  Seal  Islands.  There  is  the  last  stamping  [sic]  ground  of  the 
fur  seal  his  last  hope.  He  had  been  driven  there  and  it  is  his  last  refuge.  He  has  been 
exterminated  from  the  Southern  Hemisphere,  and  he  breeds  now  at  these  islands  only, 
and  he  must  be  protected  or  sealskin  sacques  will  soon  become  curiosities.  When  Alaska 
was  bought  by  the  United  States  these  islands,  of  course,  were  included  in  the  purchase. 

Having  these  seals  upon  them  they  were  very  valuable;  in  fact  they  were  the  only  thing  then 
known  of  any  particular  value  in  Alaska,  and,  of  course,  were  reserved  by  the  United  States. 

In  1867,  the  country  was  ceded  to  us,  and  in  1870,  these  islands  were  leased  to  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company,  who  have  the  privilege  of  taking  100,000  seals  on  these  island  under 
special  supervision  of  the  officers  of  the  Treasury  Department.  Section  1956  of  the  Revised 
Statutes  prohibits  the  killing  of  any  fur-bearing  animal  in  Alaska  or  the  waters  thereof, 
except  by  the  natives,  or  as  otherwise  provided  by  the  lease  of  this  company,  and  this  lease 
expires  in  1890.6

Adams,  George  Russell  (1845-1933) 

Trader,  Parrott  &  Company,  1868 

Agent,  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  1870-1876 


Genealogy 

George  Russell  Adams  was  born  March  20,  1845,  at  Hallowell,  Maine,  the  son  of  Samuel 
Adams  and  Philomena  (Johnson)  Adams.  George  Adams  was  married  in  1877  at  San 
Francisco,  California,  to  Lillian  Gertrude  Hinckley,  born  at  Blue  Hill,  Maine,  October  26, 
1857,  of  Otis  Witham  Hinckley  and  Sara  Fisher  (Stevens)  Hinckley.  The  couple  had  three 
children  born  in  San  Francisco:  Edyth  L.  Adams,  born  January  7,  1878;  and  twins  Oliver 
Morton  Adams  and  Otis  Johnson  Adams,  born  April  7,  1882.  George  Russell  Adams  died 
February  24,  1933,  at  Los  Angeles,  California.9 

Biographical  Sketch 

George  R.  Adams  was  employed  as  a  San  Francisco  fur  dealer,  and  lived  at  home  with  his 
parents.  He  became  involved  with  the  Western  Union  Telegraph  Expedition  in  1865, 10 
also  known  as  the  American  Telegraph  Expedition  per  Adams’  Fur-Seal  Arbitration  de¬ 
position  given  below. 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

George  R.  Adams  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  April  6,  1892,  before  E.  A. 
Stowell  at  San  Francisco,  California: 

I  am  a  citizen  of  the  United  States  and  a  resident  Paso  Robles,  Cal.,  where  I  am  employed  in 
general  business.  I  first  went  to  Alaska  on  the  bark  Golden  Gate,  Captain  Scammon,  June 
10,  1865,  on  the  American  Telegraph  Expedition  and  explored  the  country  about  Bering 
Sea  from  St.  Michaels  north,  returning  in  September  1867. 

In  the  spring  of  1868, 1  returned  to  Alaska  soon  after  its  purchase  by  the  United  States. 

I  went  for  the  late  John  Parrott,  of  San  Francisco,  direct  to  the  islands  of  St.  Paul  and 
St.  George.  We  were  the  first  parties  who  went  to  those  islands  after  the  purchase,  and 
commenced  taking  seals  about  the  1st  of  July.  We  and  the  other  parties  took  about  65,000 
that  year  from  St.  George  alone.  We  killed  no  females  except  by  accident,  for  the  reason 
that  we  thought  at  that  time  the  skins  of  females  were  worthless. 

No  sealing  was  done  at  the  Pribilof  Islands  during  the  seasons  of  186911  and  1870  except  for 
food  for  the  natives,  the  Government  having  declared  these  islands  a  reservation,  and  the 
lessees  did  not  perfect  the  lease  in  time  to  commence  operations  that  year  (1870).  From  the 
start  I  was  employed  by  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  and  remained  in  their  service 
until  1876,  in  charge  of  the  company’s  business  on  St.  George  Island.  During  the  season  of 
1876, 1  was  in  charge  of  their  business  at  St.  Paul  Island.12 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Historian  Harold  F.  Taggart  (“Sealing  on  St.  George  Island,  1868”)  described  Adams’ 
work  under  William  H.  Ennis,  Agent  for  Parrott  &  Company  at  St.  George  Island  early 
(April  24)  in  1868.  When  Ennis  departed  to  attend  to  filing  proper  papers  for  trading  in 
Alaska,  he  left  Adams  and  Osborne  Howes  Jr.  in  charge  of  the  St.  George  sealing  opera-

tions.  Taggart  warned  his  readers  that  Adams  enjoyed  telling  a  good  tale  so  that  some  of 
his  yarns  might  best  be  taken  with  a  grain  of  salt.  For  example,  Adams  modified  or  clari¬ 
fied  Ennis’  real  reason  behind  his  departure  from  St.  George.  According  to  Adams,  Ennis 
had  to  have  his  vessel,  the  Caldera,  which  had  rum  aboard,  cleared  with  the  government 
before  the  Caldera  could  land  in  Siberia.  The  Parrott  crew,  said  Adams,  used  the  rum  to 
bribe  the  Natives  into  lightering  lumber  and  other  cargo  off  the  Caldera  during  a  reli¬ 
gious  holiday.  Further,  Adams  claimed  with  relish  that  he  got  the  islands’  Orthodox  priest 
“ gloriously ”  drunk  on  the  rum  because  the  priest,  Father  Shiesnikoff,13  had  vociferously 
decried  Adams’  disrespect  for  the  Natives  and  their  religion.14 

During  1868,  competition  among  rival  sealing  companies  required  either  diplomacy 
or  fisticuffs,  but  diplomacy  eventually  won  out.  Hutchinson,  Kohl  &  Company  held  the 
strongest  position  on  the  islands  for  taking  control  of  the  seal  harvest.  The  Company 
persuaded  most  of  its  competitors  to  enter  into  an  agreement  that  allowed  each  to 
profit  from  the  taking  of  the  seals.  In  July  1868,  Captain  Gustaf  Niebaum  of  Hutchinson, 
Kohl  arrived  at  St.  George  and  offered  Adams  a  company  position  at  St.  Michael  Island. 
Adams  accepted  Niebaum's  offer  and  traveled  to  St.  Michael  aboard  the  brig  Constantine 
to  accept  the  former  Russian-American  Company  property  from  the  Russian  governor, 
Prince  Maksoutoff.15 

Adams  wrote  of  his  escapades  at  the  Pribilofs  in  an  unpublished  article  titled  “Pioneer 
Fur  Sealing  in  Alaska.”16

Assistant  Special  Agent  Thomas  E.  Adams  served  on  St.  Paul  Island  under  Agent  Joseph 
Crowley  from  May  1893  until  the  end  of  the  sealing  in  1896,  excepting  September  1894- 
May  1895.  It  was  during  his  stay  through  the  winter  of  1896  that  the  first  St.  Paul  Village 
Council  was  formed— a  result  of  community  displeasure  over  the  theft  of  materials  from 
the  doctor’s  residence  and  the  village  shop.  A  search  of  people’s  homes  and  other  build¬ 
ings  located  the  stolen  items,  along  with  others  not  belonging  to  the  culprit.  The  thief  had 
been  after  medicinal  alcohol  and  other  materials  for  making  home  brew,  or  quass T  The 
Native  community  selected  a  group  of  men  to  form  a  council  to  address  the  quass  prob¬ 
lem,  as  well  as  other  community  issues.18  Government  officials  approved  of  the  council 
but  insisted  they  also  had  to  approve  any  decisions  it  made.  During  1896,  the  council  held 
at  least  four  meetings.  Adams  recorded  the  outcomes  in  the  Agent’s  Log;  his  record  of  the 
initial  meeting  read:

The  First  St.  Paul  Island  Council  is  Formed 

February  24,  1896 

The  immediate  men  who  are  termed  a  council  and  whom  I  consult  with  upon  all  matters 
pertaining  to  the  community  interests  and  welfare  are:  Apolan  Burdukasky,  Karp  Buterin, 

Aggie  Kushing,  Markel  Volkoff,  Theo  Sedick,  and  Martin  NederazofF. 

They  discuss  any  and  all  questions  with  the  officer  and  are  called  in  to  confer  with  him 
related  to  complaints,  adjustment  of  quarrels  and  punishment,  this  being  agreeable  to  the 
community.  They  then  communicate  the  result  of  their  conferences  with  the  govt,  official 
to  the  community  in  a  general  meeting.  The  council  after  consulting  with  the  adult  natives 
brought  to  me  for  consideration  the  following  regulation  drafted  among  themselves, 
without  suggestion  from  me,  and  asked  my  approval,  until  it  was  given.19 

The  following  week  the  St.  Paul  Village  Council  passed  its  first  resolution,  express¬ 
ing  its  concern  about  quass  brewing.  The  resolution  handed  to  Assistant  Special  Agent 
Adams  for  approval  read:

evils  of  quass  brewing  and  damaging  results  it  makes  upon  domestic  happiness  in  the 
community  and  have  as  the  result  of  our  own  sincere  wishes  as  well  as  those  of  Mr.  T.E. 

Adams,  U.S.  Treasury  Agent,  organized  ourselves  for  the  supervision  of  quass.  We  agree 
1st.  To  suppress  all  quass  brewing  and  its  use,  even  in  seclusion,  in  this  Community. 

2nd.  We  bind  ourselves  to  strictly  observe  the  fulfillment  of  the  above. 

3rd.  Any  person  or  persons  found  guilty  of  violating  any  or  part  of  these  resolutions  must 
undergo  such  punishment  as  shall  be  deemed  suitable.

The  Village  Council  convened  a  third  time  for  what  became  the  first  St.  Paul  Island 
community  meeting,  in  the  village  shop.  As  entered  into  the  Agent’s  Log: 

Sunday  May  10,  1896 

That  the  natives  had  agreed  not  to  shoot  sea  lions,  not  to  kill  sea  lion  pups  and  do  all  they 
could  to  protect  them. 

It  was  agreed  that  a  library  and  reading  room  should  be  started  and  that  monthly 
subscriptions  should  be  taken  up  for  the  purpose  of  purchasing  books,  and  an  effort  made 
to  secure,  by  purchase  or  otherwise,  the  use  of  the  old  billiard  hall. 

It  was  agreed  that  all  children  should  be  kept  at  home  after  dark  and  more  interest  should 
be  taken  in  the  school  and  having  the  children  learn. 

The  committee  also  asked  that  the  officials  of  the  Treasury  Dept,  make  some  enquiry 
relating  to  their  money,  a  fund  of  $15,000  or  more  deposited  with  the  chancery  years  ago. 

The  same  being  intended  to  draw  interest,  no  interest  has  ever  been  received  nor  can  they 
get  any  information  themselves  regarding  the  principle.21

I  was  asked  to  request  of  the  chief  agent  that  time  be  allowed  the  natives  during  the  1896 
season  to  do  the  following  work  which  is  necessary  for  themselves  and  the  community:  viz: 

To  dig  two  or  three  wells 

To  construct  a  wash  house  for  village  use 

To  construct  two  baths  for  village  use 

Two  of  the  bells  hanging  in  church  yard  were  donated  to  two  poor  congregations,  one  bell 
to  go  to  the  native  church  at  Kasquiquim  and  the  other  to  [unreadable] 

At  the  meeting  and  afterwards  $16.65  each  was  secured  towards  a  library  fund,  more  to  be 
subscribed  as  the  men  earn  some  money.22 

A  month  later  the  Natives  adopted  another  resolution,  which  they  submitted  and 
received  council  approval  for.  This  resolution  concerned  the  church  funds: 

Wednesday  June  10th  1896 

Resolved  that  the  money  belonging  to  church  of  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska,  now  in  the  hands  of 
the  church  officials  of  said  church,  will  not  be  permitted  to  be  shipped  from  this  island,  as  it 
is  needed  badly  for  the  repairs  of  the  church  and  its  vicinity,  also  for  the  priests  house  and 
cemetery  and  its  fence,  [unclear]  ...  on  behalf  of  the  people.

The  resolution  went  into  effect  on  July  8,  1896,  with  a  formal  letter  from  Agent  Joseph  B. 

Crowley  to  the  Unalaska  Ecclesiastical  Superintendent,  Reverend  Alexander  Kedrousky, 
when  granting  him  permission  to  visit  St.  Paul  Island  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining 
funds  much  needed  by  the  community  for  their  own  church  property.24

born  July  1857  in  Nova  Scotia,  Canada;  no  children  were  born  to  them.  By  1910,  the 
Alexanders  lived  on  Sixth  Street  in  Washington,  D.C.31 

Biographical  Sketch 

Alvin  Burton  Alexander  spent  his  youth  in  the  seaport  village  of  Lynn,  Massachusetts. 
The  1870  U.S.  Census  showed  him  to  be  sixteen  years  old  and  working  as  a  fisherman. 
Ten  years  later  he  remained  a  Lynn  resident,  unmarried,  and  working  as  a  carpenter  in  his 
father’s  shipbuilding  business.  Alvin  B.  Alexander  joined  the  U.S.  Fish  Commission  and 
crewed  with  the  Albatross  in  the  North  Pacific  as  a  fisheries  biologist  and  photographer 
until  at  least  1904.  He  subsequently  settled  in  Washington,  D.C.,  as  a  civil  servant  for  the 
Bureau  of  Fisheries.  His  photographs  of  the  pelagic  sealing  era  are  identified  in  many 
government  and  other  publications  by  his  recognizable  ABA  initials.32 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Alvin  B.  Alexander  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  May  26,  1892,  before  H.  L. 
Burkett  at  Fort  Townsend,  Washington:33 

Alvin  B.  Alexander  ...  37  years  of  age,  a  citizen  of  Gloucester,  Mass.,  and  have  been  for 
six  years  and  still  am  an  employee  of  the  U.S.  Fish  Commission  as  a  fishery  expert,  being 
detailed  for  service  on  the  Fish  Commission  steamer  Albatross.  On  March  29th  I  was 
detailed  for  temporary  service  on  the  United  States  revenue  steamer  Corwin,  and  am 
still  so  engaged.  During  my  service  on  the  Corwin  I  have  cruised  as  far  north  as  Yakutat 
Bay.  I  have  visited,  with  but  few  exceptions,  all  the  ports  and  native  villages  from  Dixon’s 
Entrance  to  and  including  Yakutat  Bay.  I  have  personally  conversed  with  the  Indians, 
owners  of  vessels,  seal  hunters,  both  native  and  white,  and  others  engaged  in  the  sealing 
business.  I  have  been  in  canoes  and  boats,  and  personally  observed  the  taking  of  seals  by 
all  methods  practiced  on  this  coast,  and  have  thus  sought  to  familiarize  myself  in  every 
way  with  the  aquatic  habits  of  the  seal,  their  habitat,  method  of  capture,  and  all  matters  of 
interest  connected  with  the  sealing  industry. 

From  my  general  knowledge  of  natural  history,  from  my  study  of  the  habits  of  seals,  as  well 
as  from  the  opportunities  I  have  had  to  acquaint  myself  with  the  sources  of  destruction 
which  are  at  work,  I  firmly  believe  that  pelagic  sealing  would  not  only  account  for  the 
diminution  of  the  seal  herd,  but  if  continued  the  seals  will  inevitably  be  commercially 
destroyed.34 

An  excerpt  of  Alvin  Alexander’s  testimony  was  used  by  the  British  to  counter  the 
popular  claim  that  continued  to  the  near-present  day  (2008)  that  the  fur  seal  sinks  almost 
immediately  upon  being  shot.  To  the  contrary,  Alexander  stated: 

It  has  been  my  observation  that  the  rapidity  with  which  seals  sink  is  influenced  by  several 
conditions.  A  pregnant  female  will  sink  less  quickly  than  a  male  of  equal  size.  If  a  seal  be 
shot  at  a  time  when  the  air  is  well  exhausted  in  the  lungs,  it  will  sink  more  quickly  than  if 
killed  when  the  lungs  are  inflated.  If  a  seal  is  asleep  and  shot  in  the  back  of  the  head  it  will 
float  for  several  minutes,  thus  enabling  the  hunter  to  secure  it.35 

Regardless  of  this  view  promoted  by  the  British,  Alexander  offered  additional  details 
as  to  why  the  nearly  indiscriminate  killing  of  seals  by  pelagic  sealers  was  significantly 
contributing  to  the  diminution  of  the  herd.3'1

Biographical  Sketch 

Merle  Alger  spent  his  early  years  as  a  farm  boy 
in  Springfield,  Virginia.  As  a  teenager  he  lived 
with  his  parents  and  family  in  Ranson,  Jefferson 
County,  West  Virginia.  In  1927,  Alger  became  a 
Jefferson  County  constable  in  Charles  Town,  a 
position  he  held  until  May  of  1935,  at  which  time 
he  left  the  town  for  his  assignment  with  the  U.S. 
Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  to  assist  with  the  sealing 
operations  on  the  Pribilof  Islands,  Alaska. 

Alger’s  grandson,  Dr.  Douglas  Allara,  re¬ 
called  being  told  how  his  grandfather  Merle  got 
the  Pribilof  assignment.  “It  was  the  middle  of  the 
Depression  era  and  when  Grandfather  was  ap¬ 
proached  by  his  well-known  acquaintance,  West 
Virginia’s  Senator  Jennings  Randolph,  and  asked, 
‘Do  you  want  a  job  in  Alaska  assisting  with  the 
sealing  industry  at  the  Pribilof  Islands?  You  and 
your  family  will  have  housing,  food,  all  expenses 
paid  for.’ ...  He  answered  yes.38 

Upon  his  return  to  Charles  Town  from 
Alaska,  Merle  Alger  was  appointed  Justice  of  the 
Peace  and  served  in  that  position  for  Jefferson 
County  until  June  1975.  Upon  his  retirement,

the  68  year  old  said  he  has  heard  about  20,500  criminal  cases  and  about  9,000  civil  cases 
during  his  tenure  in  the  court. . . .  Alger  said  he  won’t  miss  his  work,  adding,  “I  was  always 
busy  and  enjoyed  it,  but  I  can’t  take  it  anymore.”39 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Merle  E.  Alger,  his  wife  Rebecca,  and  their  daughter  Becky  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  on 
May  12,  1935,  just  as  the  sealing  season  had  begun.  Alger’s  first  assignment  was  leading 
a  crew  of  twelve  temporary  island  men  in  clearing  rock  from  the  Reef  Point  seal  runway. 
Several  years  later  the  Agent’s  Report  told  why  such  work  was  necessary: 

The  Reef  seal-way  at  the  point  where  it  commences  near  the  main  Reef  haul-out  grounds, 
has  lain  across  fields  of  great  stones.  In  times  past  many  seals  have  bruised  themselves 
by  falls  when,  during  drives,  they  have  scrambled  from  one  boulder  to  another.  Resulting 
from  these  injuries,  large  discolored  areas  developed  in  the  pelts,  to  their  commercial 
depreciation.”40 

Besides  working  on  the  seal  runway,  Alger  helped  with  various  other  jobs  during 
1935,  as  noted  in  the  Agent’s  Log:  repairing  the  road  at  the  radio  station;  driving  the  truck 
and  hauling  carcasses  for  the  by-products  plant  with  the  sealing  gang;  and  after  sealing 
season,  taking  charge  of  the  crew  cleaning  Ice  House  Lake.41 

During  Alger’s  stay  on  St.  Paul  Island,  the  Agent  Log  recorded  that  he  was  foreman 
for  repair  and  replacement  of  damaged  roadways,  in  particular  Northeast  Point  Road, 
which  took  most  of  1937  to  complete. 

The  new  scoria  road  toward  Marunich  on  St.  Paul  Island,  which  branches  westward  from 
the  Northeast  Point  Road  near  Halfway  Point,  was  extended  one-half  mile.  Considerable 
work  was  done  in  repairing  Northeast  Point  Road,  including  the  sodding  of  sand  dune 
along  the  roadway.  Some  repairs  also  were  made  on  Zapadni  Road.  In  the  spring  there  was 
built  a  retaining  wall  for  the  road  bank  around  Big  Lake,  where  high  water  and  continuous 
south  winds  had  caused  considerable  damage  during  the  winter.42 

While  on  St.  Paul  Island,  Alger  observed  the  arrivals  of  the  Japanese  training  ship 
Hakuyo  Maru  each  July  during  1935-37.  The  ship  and  crew  came  to  the  island  at  least 
one  day  each  year  during  Alger’s  time  on  the  Pribilof  Islands,  and  each  year  they  played

the  Hakuyo  Maru’s  Captain  Nakagawa  and  his  officers  also 
came  ashore.  After  Pearl  Harbor  was  bombed  in  1941, 
Alger  interpreted  the  Japanese  visits  to  St.  Paul  Island  as 
possible  spying  missions.  Alger  told  his  grandchildren  that 
he  remembered  the  Japanese  sailors  were  friendly  to  the 
children  and  asked  to  take  photographs  of  them,  then  posi¬ 
tioned  them  so  the  photographs  included  the  background 
images  they  were  really  after.43 

Alger  and  his  family  left  St.  Paul  Island  for  their  home 
in  West  Virginia  on  November  2,  1937.44  A  local  newspa¬ 
per  article,  “Real  Fisherman  to  Tell  Tales,”  announced  their 
homecoming  with  the  following  news  item  (however,  he

Agent,  North  American  Commercial  Company,  1882-1913

Genealogy 

Watson  Colt  Allis’  genealogy  was  summarized  by  renowned  Alaskan  author  Barrett 
Willoughby  in  the  St.  Helena  Star  newspaper  following  Allis’  death: 

Watson  Colt  Allis  was  born  June  15,  1857,  at  Topsfield,  Mass.  He  was  the  eighth  generation 
of  his  family  in  America.  When  a  babe  in  arms,  he  was  taken  to  Randolph,  Vermont,  where 
he  was  raised  to  young  manhood. 

His  father  was  Obediah  Dickinson  Allis,  a  professor  at  Dartmouth  College,  who  resigned 
from  that  post  to  preach  for  the  Congregational  Church  until  his  death.  His  mother  was 
Anne  Eliza  Colt,  one  of  eleven  children,  whose  father  was  a  New  York  merchant  and 
manufacturer  of  firearms  [Colt  Firearms  Co.].50 

Biographical  Sketch 

Alaskan  author  Barrett  Willoughby’s  biographical  sketch  about  Watson  Colt  Allis  in  the 
April  10,  1942,  edition  of  the  California  newspaper  St.  Helena  Star  continued  in  part: 

He  was  the  only  adventurer  in  his  colonial  family  who  ever  came  West.  After  having 
learned  a  trade  and  being  employed  by  the  Fairbanks  Seal  [Scale]  Co.  on  both  the  Atlantic 
and  Pacific  coast  he  became  interested  in  whaling  and  the  sealing  industry  of  the  North. 

His  adventures  included  a  whaling  expedition  within  the  Arctic  Circle  where  the  ship 
was  caught  in  the  ice  and  wrecked,  losing  a  fortune  and  narrowly  escaping  with  his  life. 

Later  he  was  associated  with  the  North  American  Commercial  Company  and  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company,  and  in  accord  with  the  development  ensuing  government  control 
of  Alaska,  he  entered  the  employ  of  the  United  States  Department  of  Commerce  with  the 
Bureau  of  Fisheries,  now  known  as  the  Wild  Life  Service,  in  the  regulation  and  protection 
of  the  fur  seal  herds  with  Summer  quarters  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  the  Bering  Sea.51 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Watson  C.  Allis  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  July  5,  1892,  before  Public 
Notary  E.  H.  Tharp  at  San  Francisco,  California: 

I  am  36  years  old,  an  American  citizen  residing  in  San  Francisco,  California,  and  by 
occupation  an  Agent  of  the  Fairbanks  Scale  Company,  engaged  in  selling  and  setting  up 
scales.  In  the  summer  of  1882,  and  again  from  the  spring  of  1887  to  the  fall  of  1889, 1  was 
Assistant  Agent  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  upon  St.  Paul  Island,  and  worked  four 
sealing  seasons  in  charge  of  a  gang  of  natives  engaged  in  seal  killing.  The  work  was  done 
under  the  general  direction  of  the  Superintendent  of  the  Sealeries,  who  placed  a  “boss”  or 
leader  at  the  head  of  each  gang  of  men.  It  was  the  business  of  the  boss  to  divide  his  gang  in 
proper  proportions  into  “killers,”  “rippers,”  and  “skinners.”  The  “killers”  were  generally  the 
same  men  day  after  day  through  the  season.  They  became  very  expert  in  the  management 
of  the  drove  and  the  use  of  the  seal  club,  and  very  rarely  made  the  mistake  of  hitting  a  seal 
that  was  not  wanted.52

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Watson  Colt  Allis  worked  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  from  1882  to  1922.  For  a  book  by  Barrett 
Willoughby  titled  Alaska  Holiday  (1940),  Allis  told  of  his  forty  years  on  the  Pribilof 
Islands,  known  to  him  as  the  “Treasure  Islands  of  the  Mists.”  Two  excerpts  are  given  here:

met.  Friendship  grew  Into  HcrtUI.  «iio  mine  from  Nfew--XdrX 


The  most  eventful,  as  well  as  the  most  harrowing, 
years  I  knew  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  were  the  so- 
called  Gay  Nineties  [referring  to  the  pelagic  sealing 
years  of  the  1890s]. . . .  The  native  Aleuts  called 
[Allis]  Tyone  [toion],  beloved  boss.53 


I  recall  a  pretty  little  girl  who  came  to  the  islands  as 
the  bride  of  our  newly-appointed  superintendent; 
and  even  now,  I  mentally  take  off  my  hat  to  her. 

The  Coast  Guard  cutter  bringing  the  new  boss  and 
his  wife  arrived  one  dreary,  drizzling  day.  Since  the 
sea  is  too  rough  for  the  maintenance  of  a  wharf  on 
St.  Paul,  the  cutter  had  to  anchor  about  two  miles 
offshore  to  discharge  its  freight  and  passengers  onto 
skin  boats  and  launches.  I  went  out  to  find  the  ship 
wallowing  to  her  scuppers  in  a  heavy  sea. 


My  first  glimpse  of  the  bride  revealed  her  clinging  to 
the  swaying  length  of  a  Jacob’s  ladder  that  alternately 
swung  her  far  out  over  the  waves,  then  snapped  her 
back  again  to  crash  against  the  side  of  the  heaving 
ship.  Below  her,  in  an  open  skin  boat,  crouched  the 
bridegroom,  yelling  to  her  to  let  go  and  drop  when 
the  tossing  cockle-shell  he  was  in  rose  on  a  swell  to 
meet  her.

Ericson  Photographs,  Archives,  Alaska 
and  Polar  Regions  Coll.,  Rasmuson 
Library,  University  of  Alaska  Fairbanks, 
p.  25) 


The  little  bride  watched  her  chance,  and  presently 
dropped  like  a  small  sack  of  potatoes  into  the 
bottom  of  the  skin  boat.  I  expected  hysterics;  but 
when  her  husband  helped  her  up,  she  was  laughing. 
Already  stowed  in  the  boat,  under  a  tarpaulin,  were 
her  household  treasures— a  tea  table,  a  sewing 
machine,  and — of  all  things — a  crate  of  prize 
chickens,  cackling  to  beat  all  get-out.  The  bride 
crawled  under  the  tarp  next  to  the  chickens  and  after 
clucking  soothingly  to  them,  peeped  out  to  make  gay 
comments  as  the  native  paddlers  worked  our  boat 
ashore  through  the  breakers.  The  drizzle  had  turned 
to  a  downpour  by  this  time. 


The  moment  she  stepped  to  the  land,  where  the 
Russian  priest  and  the  entire  native  population 
waited  to  greet  her,  things  began  to  happen.  She  was 
the  kind  of  girl  who  cannot  rest  until  everyone  and  everything  about  her  is  comfortable. 
The  first  to  claim  her  shocked  attention  were  our  veteran  Pribilof  hens,  every  one  of  which 
had  lost  its  comb  and  sundry  other  appendages  during  the  previous  freezing  winter.  We 
old-timers  laughed  at  her  idea  of  erecting  special  quarters,  with  electric  light  and  heat, 
for  all  Pribilof  poultry.  But  she  insisted,  so  it  was  done.  And  the  following  winter,  those 
pampered  tenants  of  her  ‘hen  hotel’  amazed  us  by  delivering  enough  eggs  to  supply  the 
officers  table  all  during  the  frozen  months.

husband  carpet  the  church.  The  old  priest,  aghast,  explained  that  such  a  thing  was  never, 
never  done!  But  in  the  end,  the  church  was  carpeted. 

The  native  funerals — and  there  were  many  that  year — filled  her  with  horror.  In  accordance 
with  an  old  custom,  the  open  coffin  was  placed  at  the  church  door,  and  every  native  on 
the  island  filed  past  and  pressed  a  kiss  on  the  face  of  the  departed.  The  little  bride  tried  to 
dissuade  them  from  this  unsanitary  practice.  Failing,  she  instituted  a  reform  by  having  the 
priest  bless  a  bolt  of  white,  sterilized  ribbon.  One  end  of  this  was  then  placed  across  the 
face  of  the  deceased  and,  after  each  kiss,  she  herself  rolled  the  ribbon  up  a  few  inches,  thus 
presenting  an  aseptic  spot  for  the  lips  of  the  next  mourner.54 

Watson  Colt  Allis’  activities  were  occasionally  transcribed  in  the  Agent  Logs.  For 
example: 

Mr.  Allis  and  four  men  put  in  an  arrangement  for  launching  the  bidarra  [sic].  This  [is]  a

men  began  the  creation  of  the  cemetery  fence.  Mr.  Allis  kindly  loaning  them  a  team  for  the

Andrews,  Roy  Chapman  (1884-1960) 

Assistant  Curator  of  Mammalogy,  American  Museum  of  Natural  History 
Cinematographer,  August  1913 

Genealogy 

Roy  Chapman  Andrews  was  born  on  January  26,  1884,  at  Beloit,  Wisconsin,  the  son 
of  wholesale  druggist  Charles  Ezra  Andrews  and  Cora  May  (Chapman)  Andrews.  Roy 
C.  Andrews  was  married  on  October  7,  1914,  at  Ossining,  New  York,  to  Yvette  Borup, 
daughter  of  Henry  Dana  Borup  and  Mary  Watson  Brandreth  Andrews.  The  marriage  of 
Roy  and  Yvette  ended  in  divorce  in  1931,  at  Paris,  France.  Andrews  was  married  a  second 
time  to  Wilheimina  Anderson  Christmas  on  February  21,  1935,  in  Manhattan,  New  York. 
Mrs.  Christmas  was  the  widow  of  Manhattan  stockbroker  Franklin  B.  Christmas,  and  the 
daughter  of  Chattanooga,  Tennessee,  surgeon  William  E.  Anderson  and  Lottie  Dewees 
Anderson.  Roy  Chapman  Andrews  died  in  Carmel,  California,  on  March  11,  I960.56 


Biographical  Sketch 

Roy  Andrews’  true-adventure  story,  Under  a  Lucky  Star,  is  a  vibrant  tale  about  his  life  as 
an  explorer  and  naturalist,  as  he  discovered  and  created  collections  of  artifacts  for  the 
American  Museum  of  Natural  History. 

From  the  time  that  I  can  remember  anything  I  always  intended  to  be  an  explorer,  to  work 
in  a  natural  history  museum,  and  to  live  out  of  doors.  Actually,  I  never  had  any  choice  of  a 
profession.  I  wanted  to  be  an  explorer  and  naturalist  so  passionately  that  anything  else  as 
a  life  work  just  never  entered  my  mind.  Of  course,  I  didn’t  know  how  I  was  going  to  do  it, 
but  I  never  let  ways  and  means  clutter  my  youthful  dreams.  I  have  often  said  that  if  I  had 
inherited  ten  million  dollars  at  birth  I  should  have  lived  exactly  the  kind  of  life  I  have  lived 
with  no  inheritance  at  all.  A  lot  of  money  probably  wouldn’t  have  been  good  for  me,  but  I 
believe  that  even  independent  wealth  couldn’t  have  switched  me  off  from  exploration.  The 


137 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


only  difference  would  have  been  that  I  would  have  financed  my  own  expedition  instead  of 
getting  other  people  to  pay  the  bills.  ’ 

Andrews  graduated  from  Beloit  College,  Beloit,  Wisconsin,  in  1906.  He  financed  his 
college  education  with  his  taxidermy  skills,  which  were  self-taught  “by  means  of  William  T. 
Hornaday’s  book,  Taxidermy  and  Home  Decoration .”58  Shortly  after  graduation  Andrews 
embarked  upon  his  life’s  career  as  an  explorer  (chronicled  in  his  book  in  the  third  person): 

That  summer  he  began  a  thirty-five  year  association  with  the  American  Museum  of  Natural 
History.  Arriving  in  New  York  City  with  only  thirty  dollars,  he  went  to  the  museum  and 
asked  the  director,  Hermon  C.  Bumpus,  for  a  job,  expressing  his  willingness  to  scrub 
floors,  if  necessary.  When  Bumpus  observed  that  college  graduates  should  not  scrub  floors, 
Andrews  replied  “not  just  any  floors,  but  Museum  floors  are  different.59 

He  was  hired  as  a  general  assistant  in  the  Department  of  Preparation,  where  he  mixed 
clay  and  helped  set  up  exhibits. 

Endowed  with  enormous  energy  and  ability,  Andrews  soon  established  a  reputation  in  the 
field  of  cetaceans.  Before  the  age  of  thirty,  he  was  a  leading  authority  on  whales.  One  of  his 
first  assignments  had  been  to  obtain  the  skeleton  of  a  whale  washed  up  on  Long  Island.  He 
had  to  work  waist-deep  in  freezing  sea  water  to  retrieve  the  remains.  Soon  afterward,  he 
helped  overcome  problems  in  the  construction  of  the  life-size  model  of  a  giant  blue  whale, 
one  of  the  museum’s  most  popular  exhibits.  He  was  appointed  assistant  in  mammalogy  in 
1909  and  assistant  curator  of  the  department  of  mammals  in  1918. 

Andrews  sailed  on  expeditions  to  the  Pacific  Ocean,  studying  whales  and  the  whaling 
industry.  The  museum  sent  him  to  British  Columbia  and  Alaska  in  1908,  and  in  1909-10 
he  was  its  representative  aboard  the  U.S.S.  Albatross  on  a  voyage  to  the  Dutch  East  Indies, 

Borneo,  and  the  Celebes.  In  1911-12  Andrews  studied  whales  off  Korea  and  Japan,  sending 
back  [to  the  Museum]  enough  specimens  of  the  California  gray  whale,  which  had  been 
believed  extinct.  After  returning  to  the  United  States,  he  received  the  M.S.  from  Columbia 
University  in  1913,  with  a  thesis  on  whales. 

Thriving  on  adventure,  Andrews  stalked  whales,  dissected  them,  sketched  them,  and 
recorded  their  characteristics.  He  persisted  despite  almost  constant  torment  from 
seasickness  and  a  number  of  harrowing  experiences.  Shipwrecked  on  a  Pacific  island, 
he  had  to  eat  monkeys  to  survive.  On  the  deck  of  a  whaler,  he  escaped  death  by  inches 
when  the  carcass  of  a  whale  slipped  from  a  tackle,  crushing  the  man  standing  beside  him. 
Throughout  his  life  he  made  light  of  the  perils  of  exploration,  claiming  that  he  found  it 
more  dangerous  to  live  in  a  modern  city  than  in  the  wild.60 

Andrews’  life  of  scientific  work  ended  in  New  York  City  at  the  American  Museum  of 
Natural  History.  At  the  museum,  he  served  as  vice  director  in  1931-34,  and  then  director 
in  1935-42.  In  the  spring  of  1937  he  bought  Pondwood  Farm  in  Colebrook,  Connecticut, 
to  which  he  and  his  wife  retired  in  1942.  In  retirement,  he  continued  to  write  about  his 
findings  as  an  explorer.  The  Roy  Chapman  Andrews  journals  and  papers,  along  with  his 
publications,  are  located  at  the  American  Museum  of  Natural  History,  New  York.61 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Roy  C.  Andrews,  Assistant  Curator  of  Mammalogy  at  the  American  Museum  of  Natural 
History  (AMNH),  traveled  at  the  behest  of  the  Commissioner  of  Fisheries,  Dr.  Hugh  M. 
Smith,  to  take  motion  pictures  of  fur  seals.  During  1913,  he  traveled  to  St.  Paul  Island 
aboard  the  yacht  Adventuress  owned  by  John  Borden,  who  was  on  his  way  to  the  Arctic 
to  collect  a  bowhead  whale  for  the  AMNH  collection.  Andrews  claimed  his  work  rep-

resented  the  first  motion  pictures  to  be  taken  at  the  Pribilofs.62  The  Agent’s  Log  tracked 
Andrews’  motion  picture  undertakings,  documenting  that  he  had  filmed  Gorbatch  and 
Reef  rookeries.  Thanks  to  some  Aleut  men,  he  also  filmed  the  driving,  killing,  and  skin¬ 
ning  of  bachelor  seals  ( lakuq ),  the  use  of  a  baidara  ( nidiliq ),  and  reindeer  ( itgayaq ),  which 
they  had  herded  to  the  village.  We  have  been  unable  to  determine  the  whereabouts  of 
Andrews’  film  archives,  if  in  fact  they  still  exist. 


Arkhimandritov,  Ilarion  Ivanovich  (1819-1872) 

Native  of  St.  George  Island 

Assistant  Navigator,  Russian- American  Company 
Captain,  Hutchinson,  Kohl  &  Company 


Genealogy 

Ilarion  Arkhimandritov63  was  born  November  2,  1819,  on  St.  George  Island,  Alaska,  to 
Ioann  (Ivan)  Arkhimandritov,  a  Russian,  and  his  Aleut  wife,  Natalia.  Ilarion  married  an 
American  woman,  Caroline  Otis  Thompson  Peters,  in  a  civil  ceremony  at  San  Francisco 
in  November  1863.  Their  marriage  was  consecrated  by  the  Orthodox  Church  in  Sitka.64 

Biographical  Sketch 

Ilarion  Arkhimandritov  became  one  of  the  first  students  educated  in  the  new  Orthodox 
school  for  Aleuts  opened  by  Father  Ioann  Veniaminov  in  August  1827.  By  September 
1831,  Arkhimandritov  began  his  seafaring  years  on  a  voyage  to  California  aboard  the 
sloop  Zarembo.  On  November  20,  1832,  he  sailed  from  Sitka  on  the  transport  Amerika, 
and  after  an  eight-month  voyage,  arrived  at  the  Port  of  St.  Petersburg,  Russia,  where  he 
enrolled  in  the  School  of  Merchant  Seafaring. 

He  had  the  civil  status  of  a  Creole,  equivalent  in  the  Russian  ranked  society  to  a  townsman 
or  burgher.  The  Russian  government  assigned  this  status  to  persons  of  Alaskan  birth 
who  claimed  at  least  one  Russian  ancestor  or  who  occupied  positions  of  responsibility  in 
management.  In  1837,  upon  completing  a  three-and-a-half  year  course  with  the  rank  of 
assistant  navigator,  he  returned  to  Sitka  on  the  Russian  American  Company  ship  Nikolai 
(Berens),  and  in  1840,  began  service  with  the  company  at  a  salary  of  1,000  rubles  a  year.65 

While  in  the  service  of  the  Russian-American  Company,  Illarion  Arkhimandritov 
collected  artifacts  and  made  charts  of  the  districts  of  Kodiak  and  Sitka. 

On  27  February  1860,  Arkhimandritov  left  Sitka  for  Woody  Island  with  the  bark  Kodiak, 
and  a  cargo  of  construction  timber  for  a  new  ice  house.  He  took  on  a  cargo  of  356  tons 
of  ice,  but  on  30  March  struck  an  underwater  rock  off  Spruce  Island.  All  personnel  were 
saved,  but  the  vessel  and  everything  on  board  were  lost.  The  vessel  drifted  to  Spruce  Island 
and  sank  directly  in  front  of  the  chapel  with  just  one  mast  above  water  and  a  yard  that 
made  it  look  like  a  cross.66 

In  1864,  on  a  trip  to  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  islands  to  deliver  supplies  from  Unalaska 
and  to  pick  up  furs,  he  was  asked  “to  chart  the  coastal  features  and  make  soundings  for  a 
new  atlas  of  the  colonies  to  be  published  by  the  Russian-American  Company.”67

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

The  U.S.  purchase  of  Russian  America  brought  some  changes  for  Arkhimandritov,  who 
settled  in  San  Francisco  for  a  short  period  in  1867.  He  shared  his  charts  and  nautical  infor¬ 
mation  with  George  Davidson,  a  surveyor  for  U.S.  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey,  and  other 
early  American  explorers  and  map  makers.  In  1868,  he  went  to  work  with  Hutchinson, 
Kohl  &  Company. 

In  1868,  the  inhabitants  of  St.  George,  St.  Paul,  and  Unalaska  Islands  requested  him  to 
be  their  protector  before  the  American  government  in  cases  of  violence,  offenses,  and 
the  ruin  of  their  rookeries  of  sea  animals  by  foreigners  of  different  nations.  His  work  for 
Hutchinson,  Kohl  &  Company  drew  criticism  from  Agapius  Honcharenko’s  Alaska  Herald, 
a  strident  critic  of  all  activities  of  that  firm  and  its  heir,  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company.68 

Historian  Harold  F.  Taggart  in  his  published  review,  “Sealing  on  St.  George  Island,  1868,” 
presented  another  side  of  Ilarion  Arkhimandritov  (which  he  spelled  “Archimanditoff”). 
In  Taggart’s  account,  Captain  Arkhimandritov  had  charge  of  the  Hutchinson,  Kohl  & 
Company  interests  on  the  Pribilofs  in  1868,  and  worked  effectively  with  other  competi¬ 
tors,  such  as  Taylor  and  Bendel,  and  Parrott  &  Company.  George  R.  Adams,  who  rep¬ 
resented  Parrott  &  Company  interests  at  the  time,  referred  to  Captain  Arkhimandritov 
as  “really  not  a  bad  fellow  as  Russians  with  a  little  authority  go.”  Conversely,  naturalist 
William  H.  Dali,  who  briefly  visited  St.  George  Island  in  1868,  apparently  encountered 
Arkhimandritov  and  referred  to  him  as  “an  unscrupulous  fellow,  who  terrified  the  na¬ 
tives.”69 

Armstrong,  John  (b.  1844) 

Agent,  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  St.  Paul  Island,  1877-1886 
Superintendent,  Inglenook  Vineyard  and  Wine  Cellars 

Genealogy 

John  Armstrong,  son  of  Joseph  Armstrong,  was  born  in  Scotland  during  the  year  1844. 
The  Armstrong  family  moved  to  Toronto,  Canada,  when  John  Armstrong  was  a  year  old. 
In  1872,  John  Armstrong  married  Jane  Yates,  who  was  born  in  Maine  in  October  1857. 
John  and  Jane  Armstrong  had  three  children:  Jeannette,  John,  and  Joseph.70 

Biographical  Sketch 

John  Armstrong  was  trained  as  an  engineer  and  worked  at  the  Marine  Engine  Works  in 
Dundas,  near  Hamilton,  Canada.  In  1860,  just  before  the  Civil  War,  he  moved  to  Chicago. 
He  worked  for  a  short  while  on  railroads  running  out  of  Chicago  before  being  called  upon 
for  active  service  in  the  war.  Although  he  did  not  carry  a  musket,  Armstrong’s  duties 
were  far  more  onerous  and  often  perilous.  He  served  in  the  Engineering  Department 
under  General  George  H.  Thomas,  who  was  responsible  for  transporting  Union  troops 
in  Tennessee  and  adjoining  parts.  After  the  war  Armstrong  went  to  the  West  Coast  and 
for  a  time  was  in  Ben  Holladay’s  employment  running  steamers.  In  1868,  he  was  made 
chief  engineer  of  the  Fidelity,  the  first  American  steamer  to  go  to  Alaska  for  the  Alaska

Commercial  Company.  He  remained  in  this  post  until  1877,  when  he  was  sent  to  Saint 
Paul  Island  as  the  resident  agent,  and  where  he  served  until  the  fall  of  1886. 

In  1891,  John  Armstrong  moved  to  San  Francisco  for  the  winter.  Captain  Gustave 
Niebaum  induced  Armstrong  to  stay  and  apply  himself  to  the  wine  business.  He  became 
the  viticulturist  of  the  Rutherford  Winery  and  superintendent  of  the  Inglenook  Vineyard 
and  Wine  Cellars,  the  magnificent  property  of  Captain  Niebaum  (see  Nybom  biography), 
at  Rutherford,  California.71 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

John  Armstrong  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  May  10,  1892,  before  Notary 
Public  Clement  Bennett  at  San  Francisco,  California: 

I  am  50  years  old,  and  reside  in  San  Francisco.  I  was  employed  in  Alaska  service  in 
connection  with  the  seal  fisheries  from  1868  to  1886,  inclusive.  During  the  first  eight  years 
of  the  time  I  was  chief  engineer  of  the  steamer  plying  between  San  Francisco  and  the  seal 
islands  and  other  Alaska  ports,  and  from  1877  to  1886  inclusive,  as  agent  of  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company,  living  almost  constantly  for  the  whole  ten  years  upon  St.  Paul 
Island.  I  always  assisted  in  the  seal-killing,  and,  in  common  with  all  other  employees  on  the 
islands,  made  the  seals  my  study  and  care.72 


Artomanoff,  Kerrick  (1826-1900) 

Aleut  Chief,  St.  Paul  Island,  1870-1877 
Genealogy 

Kerrick  (also  spelled  Kereck)  Artomanoff  was  born  at  Northeast  Point,  St.  Paul  Island, 
Alaska,  in  1826.  Kerrick  was  married  at  least  twice,  once  to  Olga  (maiden  name  un¬ 
known)73  and  subsequently  to  Alexandra  (maiden  name  unknown).74  According  to  the 
Pribilof  census  records  for  January  1,  1873,  Kerrick  had  at  least  four  children,  two  on  St. 
Paul  Island  (son  Gaerman  aged  26  and  daughter  Malaina  aged  20)  and  two  daughters  on 
St.  George  Island  (Vasselisse  aged  14  and  Kahseenia  [Uxenia]  aged  5). 75  The  mother(s)  of 
Kerrick  Artomanoff’s  children  is  uncertain.  “Kerrick  Artomanoff  age  75  died  of  La  grippe 
[flu]  at  an  early  hour  this  morning,”  wrote  Agent  James  Judge  in  the  Agent’s  Log  on  June 
20,  1900. 

Biographical  Sketch 

Kerrick  Artomanoff  “was  probably  the  oldest  person  on  the  Island  and  until  quite  re¬ 
cently  enjoyed  good  health.  He  was  first  chief  for  a  number  of  years  and  was  considered 
a  sort  of  land-mark  and  bureau  of  information  by  most  of  the  white  men  who  visited  the 
Island  during  the  last  quarter  of  a  century.” 6 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Kerrick  Artomanoff  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  June  8,  1892,  before 
Treasury  Agent-in-Charge  William  H.  Williams  at  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska:

Puibilof  Islands:  The  People 


I  am  a  native  Aleut,  and  reside  on  St.  Paul,  Pribilof  Group,  Alaska;  1  was  born  at  Northeast 
Point,  on  St.  Paul  Island  (1826)  and  am  67  years  of  age.  I  have  worked  on  the  sealing 
grounds  for  the  last  fifty  years  and  am  well  acquainted  with  the  methods  adopted  by  the 
Russian  and  American  Governments  in  taking  of  fur  seal  skins  and  in  protecting  and 
preserving  the  herds  on  the  island.  In  1870,  when  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company 
obtained  the  lease  of  the  Islands,  I  was  made  Chief,  and  held  the  position  for  seventeen 
years.  It  was  my  duty  as  Chief  to  take  charge  of  and  conduct  the  drives  with  my  people 
from  the  hauling  to  the  killing  grounds. 

The  methods  used  by  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  and  the  American  Government 
for  the  care  and  preservation  of  the  seal  were  much  better  than  those  used  by  the  Russian 
Government.  In  old  Russian  time  we  used  to  drive  seals  from  Northeast  Point  to  the  village, 
a  distance  of  nearly  13  miles,  and  we  used  to  drive  5  or  6  miles  from  other  hauling  grounds; 
but  when  the  Americans  got  the  Islands  they  soon  after  shortend  [sic]  all  the  drives  to  less 
than  3  miles. 

Our  people  like  the  meat  of  seal,  and  we  eat  no  other  meat  so  long  as  we  can  get  it. 

The  pup  seals  are  our  chicken  meat,  and  we  used  to  be  allowed  to  kill  3,000  or  4,000  male 
pups  every  year  in  November,  but  the  Government  agent  forbade  us  to  kill  any  in  1891  . . . 
[because  the  pups  were  considered  necessary  to  sustain  the  herd  in  light  of  the  recently 
recognized  diminution  of  the  herd  size];  but  we  do  not  like  any  other  meat  as  well  as  pup- 
seal  meat.  We  understand  the  danger  there  is  in  the  seals  being  all  killed  off  and  that  we  will 
have  no  way  of  earning  our  living.78

11  Officially  no  commercial  sealing  was  allowed  during  1869,  but  unofficially  at  least  as  many  as  87,000 
fur  seals  were  killed  under  the  guise  of  a  subsistence  harvest.  Alaska  Commercial  Co.  executive 
Hayward  M.  Hutchinson  stated  in  his  testimony  before  a  congressional  committee  in  1876  that 
87,000  sealskins  were  taken  in  1869.  Later  during  the  same  congressional  investigation,  he  changed 
the  number  without  clarifying  to  69,000  sealskins  taken.  U.S.  Congress,  House,  Alaska  Commercial

Shaiashnikoff,  who  must  have  coincidentally  been  on  the  island  at  that  time,  for  in  1868,  neither  St. 
George  nor  St.  Paul  had  a  resident  priest.  Father  Shaiashnikoff  served  all  the  Aleutians  as  well  as  the 
Pribilofs  from  his  principal  residence  in  Unalaska.

Charles  Howard  Baltzo  was  born  on  June  19,  1913,  in  Seattle,  Washington,  to  Charles 
Edward  Baltzo  and  Gertrude  (Martin)  Baltzo.  Charles  Baltzo  married  Ann  P.  Hammer  on

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Biographical  Sketch 

In  1944,  Charles  Howard  Baltzo  moved  his  family 
to  Alaska,  where  he  worked  on  salmon  research 
management  for  the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service 
until  he  accepted  a  challenging  assignment  to  the 
Pribilof  Fur-Seal  Program. 

As  described  in  “A  Family  Summer  at  the 
Pribilofs,”  in  the  November  1965  issue  of  Alaska 
Sportsman  magazine,  the  family  enjoyed  St. 
George  Island  life.  Son  Stan  had  an  exciting  first 
day  on  the  island.  He  and  Walter  Kashevarof,  a 
local  boy,  clambered  down  the  1,000-foot  cliff  at 
High  Bluffs  equipped  with  a  “ten-foot  pole  having 
a  pair  of  flexible  wooden  slats  tied  to  one  end  and 
protruding  past  the  end  of  the  pole.  The  two  slats 
served  as  the  fingers  which  gently  grasped  the  be- 
speckled  murre  egg  as  it  lay  in  its  nest.”  The  boys 
managed  to  collect  some  murre  eggs  without  fall¬ 
ing  into  the  sea.  In  October  1968,  at  the  end  of  his 
Pribilof  years,  Howard  and  Ann  retired  to  their  homestead  near  Wasilla,  Alaska.  Howard 
Baltzo  died  on  May  31,  2003. 2 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

In  January  1960,  the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service,  Bureau  of  Commercial  Fisheries,  ap¬ 
pointed  Charles  Howard  Baltzo  to  direct  the  transition  (or  “phase-out,”  as  it  is  commonly 
called)  from  federal  administration  to  self-rule  by  the  Pribilof  Native  communities. 

Mr.  Baltzo’s  primary  mandate  was  to  improve  the  overall  living  conditions  of  the  Pribilof 
people  in  light  of  impending  program  changes.  The  changes  Mr.  Baltzo  made  to  the 
program  are  set  forth  in  his  May  1963  report  entitled  "Program  for  Administration  of  the 
Pribilof  Island  Federal  Reservation  Embracing  Management  of  the  Fur  Seal  Resources 
and  Development  of  the  Resident  Aleut  Inhabitants.”  As  a  result  of  Mr.  Baltzo’s  work, 
the  Federal  Civil  Service  wage  scale  was  introduced  in  1962,  for  all  people  on  the  Islands 
working  for  the  Federal  Government.  With  this  change,  Pribilovian  wages  were  brought 
into  parity  with  the  rest  of  the  Federal  workforce.  In  turn,  in  kind  compensation  such 
as  free  rent  and  food  were  substantially  reduced,  being  provided  only  to  those  with 
insufficient  wages  to  cover  necessities.  The  Federal  Government  did,  however,  continue  to 
maintain  and  administer  the  stores,  laundries,  houses,  streets,  and  all  public  buildings  and 
to  fund  educational  and  medical  services  for  all  Pribilovians  on  both  Islands.  To  preserve 
Federal  jobs,  Pribilovian  residents  continued  to  be  employed  in  these  services.3 

Later,  Baltzo  recounted  his  view  of  the  situation. 

Nothing  existed  in  writing  until  the  emancipation  was  well  along,  but  my  job  was  clearly  to 
make  the  natives  independent  and  bring  them  into  the  mainstream.4 

Howard  Baltzo  “described  the  seal  program  as  a  three-headed  one,  involving  1)  man¬ 
agement  of  the  fur-seal  program  from  the  standpoint  of  luxury  furs;  2)  scientific  research

on  seals  to  understand  them  better;  and  3)  the  administration  of  two  villages  containing 
the  650  Aleut  natives  who  harvest  pelts  on  the  Pribilofs.”5 

While  some  former  agents  encouraged  improvement  in  conditions  for  the  Aleuts, 
Washington  lacked  the  will.  Now  with  the  political  will  for  change,  Baltzo’s  administra¬ 
tion  brought  about  numerous  changes,  such  as  the  Federal  Civil  Service  wage  scale,  the 
sale  of  alcoholic  beverages,  conversion  of  heating  from  coal  to  oil,  a  new  source  of  do¬ 
mestic  water  supply,  better  fire  protection,  and  a  grade  school  system  run  by  the  Alaska 
Department  of  Education.  The  changes  also  brought  about  the  end  of  free  rent  and  food 
for  all  but  the  very  needy,  and  increased  unemployment. 

Also,  beginning  in  January  1962,  Baltzo  submitted  monthly  reports  to  the  Seattle 
office,  thereby  eliminating  the  requirement  of  maintaining  an  agent’s  daily  log  that  had 
been  mandated  since  1870.6 

Then  in  1964,  the  government  reduced  its  role  in  oversight  of  the  fur-seal  harvest.  As 
reported  in  the  New  York  Times : 

“Always  before  we  had  a  team  of  overseers  and  bosses  to  tell  them  [Aleuts]  what  to  do,”  said 
C.  Howard  Baltzo,  Director  of  the  Bureau’s  Marine  Mammal  Resources  Program,  who  has 
spent  five  summers  on  St.  Paul  directing  the  work.  “This  year  is  a  milestone  and  the  Aleuts 
are  tremendously  proud  of  their  achievement.” 

Also  in  1964,  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Interior  designated  the  Pribilof  Islands  Fur 
Seal  Rookeries  National  Historic  Landmark.  Director  Baltzo  received  the  plaque  (dated 
1964)  in  1966  on  behalf  of  the  landmark  and  placed  it  on  a  boulder  above  Kitovi  Rookery, 
St.  Paul  Island. 

In  1967,  Baltzo  provided  guidance  to  the  communities  on  implementation  of  the  Fur- 
Seal  Act  of  1966.  His  term  ended  in  October  1968.

Nathan  Banks  was  born  on  April  13,  1868,  at 
Roslyn,  New  York,  to  Daniel  G.  Banks  and  Maria 
(Hawxhurst)  Banks.  Nathan  Banks  married  Mary 
A.  LaGar  on  June  2,  1897,  in  New  York,  and 
the  couple  had  three  sons:  Bryant,  Gilbert,  and 
Waldo;  and  five  daughters:  Ruth,  Bessie,  Nellie, 
Dorothy,  and  Elsie.  Nathan  Banks  died  on  January 
24,  1953,  at  his  Cambridge,  Massachusetts  home. 
He  was  eighty-four.8 

Biographical  Sketch 

Nathan  Banks  received  his  higher  education  at 
Cornell  University,  after  which  he  worked  for 
the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA).  At 
USDA  in  1880,  he  began  research  on  spider  mites 
(Family  Tetranychidae). 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Nathan  Banks  served  with  David  Starr  Jordan  as 

Nathan  A.  Banks  (USDA.  U.S.  National  an  entomologist  while  a  member  of  the  U.S.  Fish 

Mite  Collection  History).9  Commission  in  1897,  and  as  a  member  of  the 

1899  Harriman  Alaska  Expedition.  During  his 
brief  stints  at  the  Pribilof  Islands,  he  labored  to  identify  insects  and  arachnids  (mites) 
that  were  poorly  known  at  the  time.  The  Harriman  Report  described  eighty  species  of 
insects  on  the  Pribilof  Islands,  fifty-seven  of  which  were  new  to  science.10  From  1900  to 
1916,  Banks  was  assistant  entomologist  for  the  USDA,  publishing  extensively  on  spider 
mites  and  predator  mites  (Families  Stigmaeidae  and  Cunaxidae).  He  is  reported  to  have 
written  the  first  comprehensive  handbook  on  mites  in  English.  The  following  year,  he  left 
government  work  to  join  the  Harvard  Museum  of  Comparative  Zoology  at  Cambridge, 
Massachusetts.  Banks  made  a  third  research  trip  to  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  islands  in 
1914,  as  Curator  of  Insects  at  the  Harvard  Museum  of  Comparative  Zoology.  His  ef¬ 
forts  resulted  in  the  identification  of  new  species  of  Trichopteran  caddis  flies  (Family 
Limnephilidae),  a  Mecopteran  scorpion  fly  (Family  Panorpidae),  and  numerous  mites 
(Class  Arachnida).11

Genealogy 

Milton  Barnes  was  born  at  Barnesville,  Belmont 
County,  Ohio,  April  26,  1830,  the  son  of  Abel 
Barnes  and  Elizabeth  (Wilson)  Barnes.  Milton 
Barnes  was  married  on  June  27,  1860,  at 
Cambridge,  Guernsey  County,  Ohio,  to  Rhoda 
Allison,  daughter  of  James  Allison,  of  Washington, 

Pennsylvania.  Milton  and  Rhoda  Barnes  had  five 
children:  sons  Clarence,  Lowell,  and  Walter,  and 
daughters  Tirza  and  Maud.  Milton  Barnes  died 
January  2,  1895,  at  Westerville  Village,  Blendon 
Township,  Franklin  County,  Ohio,  and  was  in¬ 
terred  at  Otterbein  Cemetery  (lot  213,  section  1, 
grave  number  E6)  in  Westerville.  Rhoda  Barnes 
also  died  at  Westerville,  on  July  5,  1919. 12 

Biographical  Sketch 

Milton  Barnes  was  raised  on  a  farm  in  Belmont 
County,  Ohio,  in  a  family  of  eleven  siblings. 

His  paternal  ancestors  were  English  and  his  mother’s  side  Welsh.  His  early  life  was  spent 
on  a  farm,  and  his  education  such  as  could  be  obtained  at  a  country  school.  At  eighteen  he 
became  a  teacher,  and  at  nineteen  attended  Allegheny  College  at  Meadville,  Pennsylvania, 
but  failing  health  compelled  his  return  home.  He  studied  law  and  higher  mathematics  at 
an  academy  at  Salem,  Ohio,  and  then  entered  a  law  office  at  Mt.  Vernon,  and  in  January 
1859,  was  admitted  to  the  bar.  He  removed  to  Cambridge  and  established  an  office,  but 
in  1861  raised  a  company  of  soldiers  and  enlisted  [August  9,  1862]  as  Captain  in  the  62nd 
Ohio  Volunteer  Infantry.  Returning  home  on  sick  leave,  he  resigned  this  command,  and 
reenlisted  as  Lieutenant  Colonel  of  the  97th  Regiment,  with  which  he  did  gallant  service. 

He  was  twice  severely  wounded,  and  was  mustered  out  in  June  [10]  1865.  He  resumed  his 
law  practice  on  his  return  home,  and  in  1867,  and  again  in  1869,  was  elected  Prosecuting 
Attorney  of  Guernsey  County.  In  1876,  he  was  nominated  and  elected  Secretary  of  State 
and  reelected  in  1878. 13 

After  he  served  as  Secretary  of  State  in  Ohio  from  1876-1881,  Milton  Barnes  and  his 
family  moved  to  Westerville,  Ohio. 

After  coming  to  this  place  [Westerville,  Ohio]  he  established  and  became  editor  of  the 
Cleveland  Saturday  Ledger,  which  was  a  literary  magazine  of  merit.  At  the  close  of  this 
enterprise  he  entered  into  counsel  with  several  business  men  and  became  one  of  the 
founders  of  The  Fraternal  Mystic  Circle,  a  life  insurance  company  on  the  mutual  plan  and 
became  its  first  president.  For  several  years  he  gave  himself  assiduously  to  promoting 
the  interests  of  the  company  until  it  had  become  well  established. ...  In  May,  1891,  he 
received  the  important  appointment  from  Secretary  Foster  as  agent  of  the  U.S.  Treasury

Department  at  Washington  to  the  Alaskan  seal  fisheries,  sailing  for  that  most  distant 
American  post  the  same  month  he  received  the  appointment. . . .  What  he  had  seen 
and  what  he  had  learned  in  that  far  off  sea  and  island  in  their  relations  to  this  and  other 
governments,  so  impressed  him  with  their  importance  that  he  immediately  set  himself  to 
the  task  of  writing  a  book  bearing  the  title,  Alaska  and  the  Fur  Seal  Fisheries  of  Behring 
Sea.  This  volume  he  was  not  permitted  to  finish.  He  leaves  hundreds  of  neatly  and  carefully 
written  pages  of  manuscript  sufficient  for  a  large  book,  but  his  failing  health  cut  short  the 
work.14 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

The  note  below  was  drafted  by  Archivist  Dr.  Robert  Hawke  of  George  Mason  University 
to  introduce  a  letter  from  Milton  Barnes  to  his  son  Clarence  upon  the  elder  Barnes’  ar¬ 
rival  at  St.  George  Island. 

NOTE:  This  letter  of  June  21,  1891,  from  Milton  Barnes  to  a  younger  son,  Clarence,  is  the 
last  in  this  collection  and  the  only  one  therein  written  in  Barnes’  capacity  as  a  U.S.  Treasury 
Agent  assigned  to  the  “Fur  Seal  Islands”  (the  Pribilofs)  in  1891-1892.  Despite  physical 
infirmities  caused  by  a  paralytic  stroke  in  the  1880s,  Barnes  had  secured  his  appointment 
from  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  Charles  Foster,  who  had  previously  been  governor  of  and  a 
congressman  from  Ohio.  This  letter  details  Barnes’  trip  from  Ohio  to  the  Pribilofs - 

In  the  letter  he  mentions  one  of  his  superiors,  Assistant  Agent  A.  W.  Favender.  His 
observations  in  the  letter  on  the  seal  fishing  methods  and  trade  and  on  the  natives  accord 
with  official  accounts.15 

The  following  are  excerpts  from  a  nine-page  typed  transcription  of  Milton  Barnes’ 

letter  to  his  son. 

St.  George  Island,  Behring  Sea- 
June  21st,  1891 

My  dear  Clarence-- 

I  presume  this  letter,  dated  in  the  midst  of  Behring  Sea,  will  seem  quite  strange  to  you. 

But  so  it  is.  After  a  long  journey — altogether  near  5500  miles,  I  have  at  last  reached  my 
destination,  and  am  settled  down  in  my  “Summer  Residence”  Island  of  St.  George!  What 
a  great — strange  world  it  is!  I  had  but  little  conception  of  what  a  trip  it  would  be,  when 
I  waived  [sic]  you  &  Ma  adieu  as  my  train  steamed  out  of  the  union  Depot  at  Columbus 
[Ohio]  on  the  morning  of  May  15th.  I  was  to  be  sure,  exhilarated  at  the  thought  of  a  nice 
long  trip  overland,  by  rail,  to  the  Pacific  Coast — and  it  was  fully  realized,  as  I  had  a  real 
pleasant  trip  thence,  indeed! 

. . .  We  set  sail  on  the  27th  of  May — about  6  o’clock  P.M. — just  in  time  to  get  out  upon  the 
Pacific  Ocean  before  night  set  in.  The  weather  was  bright  and  clear  and  the  scene  was  a 
grand  one  as  I  sat  upon  the  upper  deck  and  watched  the  receding  view  as  we  passed  out 
through  the  Golden  Gate  out  upon  the  bosom  of  old  Ocean. . . . 

At  last  during  the  evening  of  the  10th  day  [June  6]  we  . . .  espied  land,  the  rock  bluffs  and 
headlands  of  Unalaska. . . .  Then  entering  the  water  of  the  Behring  Sea,  were  again  under 
way — and  24  hours  later  we  landed  at  St.  Paul — the  larger  of  the  Pribilov,  or  Fur  Seal 
Islands — having  been  14  days  en  route — St.  Paul  is  the  larger,  and  is  the  head  quarters  for 
the  sealing  operations— St.  George  is  36  miles  south  of  it— and  I,  having  been  assigned  for 
duty  here,  came  back  here  on  the  Rush,  on  the  15th  inst. . . .  There  is  a  small  village  here, 
as  there  is  on  St.  Paul,  consisting  of  a  government  house  for  the  Treasury  Agent,  a  house, 
office  and  warehouse  for  the  Company,  and  small  one  story  frame  cottages  for  the  natives, 
who  are  employed  by  the  Company,  in  the  business  of  killing  seals  and  taking  care  of  the 
skins.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


The  Government  house  is  a  one  story  frame,  about  32  feet  square,  and  divided  into  four 
apartments,  a  sitting  room — and  office  room,  and  two  bed  rooms — all  very  comfortably 
furnished.  The  Company’s  house  is  about  the  same,  only  more  extensive  and  with  a  dining 
room  and  attached  kitchen— They  also  have  quite  a  fine  library  of  about  six  or  seven 
hundred  volumes.  I  live  in  the  Government  house  and  take  my  meals  with  the  Company’s 
mess  about  400  feet  distance.  The  only  company  I  have  in  the  Government  house  is  a  Mr. 
Lavender,  Asst.  Treasury  agent,  who  is  going  home  this  summer,  and  I  will  then  be  left 
entirely  alone,  as  agent  in  charge.  In  the  Company’s  house,  however,  there  is  a  Physician, 

Dr.  Noyes,  their  agent  Mr.  Daniel  Webster,  a  cook  or  steward,  a  school  teacher,  and  a  man 
of  all  work.  These  with  myself  will  be  all  the  white  people  there  will  be  on  this  Island, 
after  Mr.  Lavender  leaves,  for  the  ensuing  year.  There  is  a  Greek  [Orthodox]  Church  here, 
established  when  these  Islands  were  in  the  possession  of  Russia.  The  Priest  is  a  native, 
but  conducts  his  church  service  in  the  Russian  language — the  natives  are  a  curious  sort  of 
people — very  dusky  complexion,  black  strait  hair,  small  in  stature,  resembling  a  mixture  of 
indian  [sic]  and  Japanese.  There  is  a  tradition  that  more  than  a  hundred  years  ago — several 
Japanese  vessels  from  the  Asiatic  coast  were  wrecked  on  the  Aleutian  islands,  and  the 
crews,  never  being  able  to  return  to  the  place  of  their  nativity,  remained,  intermarried  with, 
and  became  a  part  of,  what  is  now  the  native  population.  They  are  a  quiet,  peacable  [sic] 
and  inoffensive  people,  they  and  their  children  are  communicants  in  the  Greek  church — 
and  seem  devoted  to  their  religion.  Their  dialect  is  a  sort  of  guttural — a  mere  jargon,  which 
is  very  difficult  to  learn.  It  also  seems  very  difficult  for  them  to  learn  the  english  [sic] 
language.  Although  there  has  been  a  sort  of  school  kept  here  for  15  or  20  years — with  a 
teacher  furnished  by  the  Company  having  the  leases,  and  required  to  do  so  in  their  lease — 
yet  there  does’nt  [sic  passim]  seem  to  be  more  than  two  or  three  of  them  who  can  carry 
on  an  intelligent  conversation  in  English.  When  talking  with  them  the  treasury  agent  has 
to  use  one  of  those  as  interpreter.  I  don’t  understand  why  this  should  be,  as  the  children 
appear  to  be  naturally  bright  enough.  St.  George  island  [sic]  is  of  a  peculiar  formation,  but 
similar  to  St.  Paul.  There  is  no  timber  on  it,  the  surface  is  very  broken  and  hilly — has  the 
appearance  of  having  been  thrown  up  by  a  volcanic  eruption  in  some  remote  period  of  the 
world’s  history — the  elevation  from  three  to  nine  hundred  feet  above  the  sea  level — the 
rocky  surface,  having  become  eroded  by  the  action  of  the  weather — has  gradually  become 
covered  with  a  sort  of  soil — composed  of  decomposed  rock  and  vegetable  mould — in  which 
there  is  a  vigorous  growth  of  a  short  broad  leafed  grass  which  grows  in  bunches  or  tufts, 
all  closely  matted  so  that  when  you  step  on  it,  you  sink  down  over  shoe  top  and  then  strain 
yourself  to  make  the  next  step,  with  the  same  result  &  [it]  soon  tires  one  out  trying  to  walk 
over  it— through  all  this— The  green  coating  of  grassy  tufts  mixed  with  a  species  of  moss,  in 
summer  time,  lends  a  beautiful  tinge  to  these  hills  and  bluff — 

There  are  no  animals  or  game  except  the  Seals  and  a  few  of  the  species  of  blue  and  the 
white  fox,  which  are  caught  by  the  natives  by  traps,  their  fur  is  very  pretty  and  valuable — 
the  white  sea  gulls  and  other  birds  of  fine  plumage  cluster  along  the  rocky  bluffs — build 
their  nests  and  deposit  their  eggs  by  the  hundred  thousand. 

The  fur  seals  are  the  principal  object  of  the  cupidity  of  man,  hereabouts— Their  nature  and 
habits  are  very  strange  to  the  uninitiated— During  the  month  of  June  and  until  the  forepart 
of  October,  they  gather  here  by  the  thousand,  formerly  by  the  hundred  thousand,  but  of  late 
their  numbers  seem  to  be  decreasing  every  year,  not  only  on  account  of  the  large  number 
taken  legitimately  by  the  Company  having  the  lease  from  the  Government,  but  by  foreign 
vessels— chiefly  those  of  Great  Britain  and  Canada— and  private  poachers  or  marauders— 
who  are  constantly  cruising  in  Bering  Sea,  shooting  them  in  the  water,  killing  mostly  the 
females — 

As  to  the  manner  of  their  legitimate  killing  on  these  islands — They  come  up  from  the 
water  and  herd  upon  the  beach  near  the  edge  of  the  islands  called  rookeries  . . .  the  young 
males  . . .  are  the  only  ones  allowed  to  be  killed  for  their  skins,  by  the  Company  . . .  the 
natives,  who  are  in  the  employ  of  the  company — get  in  between  them  and  the  water, 
and  drive  them  in  a  flock,  like  a  flock  of  sheep — up  on  to  higher  ground — away  from  the 
rookeries  proper,  to  the  place  called  the  killing  ground— If  there  is  much  distance  to  travel, 


154

they  halt  and  rest  every  few  rods — to  catch  their  breath  and  give  them  rest — then  start 
them  on  again — when  they  have  arrived  on  the  killing  ground — the  natives  separate  twenty 
or  thirty  of  them  in  a  bunch  from  the  main  flock,  and  surround  them  and  commence 
beating  them  one  at  a  time  on  the  head  with  a  club,  made  in  the  shape  of  a  base  ball  club, 
only  longer  at  the  small  end — these  strokes  [stun]  them  . . .  men  catch  and  draw  them  away 
a  few  feet  and  stick  them  with  a  sharp  butcher  knife  and  proceed  to  remove  the  skin,  much 
the  same  as  a  butcher  slaughters  a  calf — these  natives  have  become  such  adepts  at  the 
business,  that  the  process  of  killing  and  skinning  only  occupies  from  three  to  five  minutes 
in  its  execution.  After  the  killing  is  over  for  the  day,  the  skins  are  hauled  to  the  Company’s 
ware  house — where  they  are  counted,  and  a  tally  kept  by  the  officer  in  charge,  whose  report 
of  the  number  taken,  is  the  basis  upon  which  the  Company  accounts  to  the  Government, 
so  much  apiece,  as  revenue.  The  skins  are  then  carefully  packed  and  salted  with  a  coating 
of  rock  salt,  in  which  they  lie  until  the  killing  season  is  over,  when  they  are  loaded  aboard 
the  Company’s  vessel  and  shipped  to  London,  England,  where  they  are  skillfully  cured 
and  dressed  for  the  market.  They  are  then  put  up  to  sale,  and  sold  at  public  auction  to 
the  highest  bidder,  to  manufacturers  of  seal  skin  sacks  and  other  articles  of  ladies  wear.  It 
looks  very  cruel  to  witness  the  wanton  destruction  of  these  seals  and  in  such  an  apparently 
brutal  manner.  The  natives  live  principally  on  seal  meat,  and  while  the  killing  is  going  on 
their  women  and  children  are  there  with  knives  and  sacks — cutting  out  choice  pieces  of 
the  meat,  and  the  blubber,  which  they  use  extensively  for  fuel.  Portions  of  the  meat  they 
use  while  it  is  fresh  and  a  part  of  the  lean  they  cut  into  strips  and  hang  up  on  cross  poles  to 
season  in  the  open  air  to  use  later  on. 

. . .  The  outlook  is  that  my  situation  will  be  a  pleasant — one  so  far  as  personal  comfort 
is  concerned.  Save  only  the  extreme  isolation — cut  off  from  all  communication  with 
home  and  friends  for  at  least  six  months  of  the  year.  There  has  recently  been  a  mail  line 
established  between  Unalaska  at  the  pass  through  the  Aleutian  chain  of  islands,  and 
Sitka,  or  Port  Townsend  on  the  coast,  which  is  to  carry  the  mail  to  and  from,  once  a 
month.  At  these  points  on  the  coast,  I  suppose  it  will  be  transferred  to  the  Pacific  Coast 
line  of  Steamers  that  regularly  ply  up  and  down  the  coast,  between  these  points  and  San 
Francisco — thence  overland  eastward — but  between  Unalaska  and  these  islands,  near  200 
miles,  there  will  be  nothing  to  carry  the  mail  to  and  from  here,  except  the  U.S.  Revenue 
cutters,  which  will  cruise  around  in  these  waters  in  the  summer  time.  Later  in  the  fall  they 
all  return  to  San  Francisco  to  “tie  up”  for  the  winter — I  have  no  doubt  [that]  after  about 
October,  it  will  be  quite  a  lonesome  life — but  I  have  been  overhauling  the  library  here,  and 
find  it  filled  with  well  selected  reading  matter,  &c — and  after  that  I  will  have  but  little  to 
do,  but  make  myself  as  comfortable  as  possible— with  the  facilities  at  my  command— In 
the  winter  time  I  am  told  the  nights  are  long— the  sun  going  down  about  three  o’clock  P.M. 
and  rising  about  nine  A.M.,  [making]  about  sixteen  to  eighteen  hours  of  darkness.  In  the 
summer  it  is  the  reverse — Since  I  came  here,  the  sun  doesn’t  go  down  until  nine  and  it  is 
after  ten  when  it  gets  dark  enough  to  have  a  lamp,  and  daylight  begins  to  break  about  two 
in  the  morning— The  [islands]  are  in  latitude  54  degrees  north,  and  Longitude  170  west— 

The  difference  in  time  between  this  and  Columbus  is  nearly  6  hours— so  that  when  you  are 
eating  supper  we  are  just  sitting  down  to  dinner — 

Now  my  dear  boy,  it  has  been  a  month  and  12  days  since  I  left  home  and  I  begin  to  want 
letters  pretty  badly  I  assure  you— won’t  you  sit  down  as  soon  as  you  receive  this,  and  write 
me  a  good  long  letter.  You  need’nt  [sic]  cut  it  short  for  the  want  of  material.  You  should 
remember  that  now,  isolated  as  [I]  am  and  will  be,  every  little  thing  concerning  yourself  or 
the  occurrences  around  you  will  be  of  interest  to  me,  although  they  may  be  stale  to  you. . . . 

And  Now  Good  Bye  my  dear  son. 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Milton  Barnes  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  before  Treasury  Agent-in-Charge 
William  H.  Williams  on  June  23,  1892,  at  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska: 


155 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


I  am  a  citizen  of  the  United  States  and  when  at  home  reside  near  Columbus,  Ohio.  Have 
been  temporarily  stationed  during  the  last  year  on  the  Island  of  St.  Paul ...  as  special 
employee  of  the  United  States  Treasury  Department  on  said  island. 

One  day,  during  the  latter  part  of  August  or  fore  part  of  September  last  (exact  date 
forgotten),  Col.  Joseph  Murray,  one  of  the  Treasury  agents,  and  myself,  in  company  with 
the  British  Commissioners,  Sir  George  Baden-Powell  and  Dr.  Dawson,  by  boat  visited  one 
of  the  seal  rookeries  of  that  Island,  known  as  Tolstoi  or  English  Bay.  On  arriving  there  our 
attention  was  at  once  attracted  by  the  excessive  number  of  dead  seal  pups  whose  carcasses 
lay  scattered  profusely  over  the  breeding  ground  or  sand  beach  bordering  the  rookery 
proper. . . . 

Some  days  after  this  ...  I  drove  with  Mr.  Fowler,  an  employe  [sic]  of  the  lessees,  to  what  is 
known  as  Half-Way  Point,  or  Polovinia  [sic]  rookery.  Here  the  scene  was  repeated,  but  on  a 
more  extensive  scale  in  point  of  numbers. . . .  This  condition  of  the  rookeries  in  this  regard 
was  for  some  time  a  common  topic  of  conversation  in  the  village  by  all  parties,  including 
the  more  intelligent  ones  among  the  natives,  some  of  whom  were  with  Mr.  J.  Stanley  Brown 
in  his  work  of  surveying  the  island.16 

The  seal  experts  later  (1896-97)  determined  that  the  vast  majority  of  pups  discussed 
in  Barnes’  deposition  succumbed  to  starvation  as  their  mothers  had  been  killed  at  sea  by 
the  pelagic  sealers.  Also,  infestation  by  parasitic  worms  caused  physical  weakness  that 
subjected  many  pups  to  death  by  trampling  from  the  movements  of  bull  and  cow  seals.17

Genealogy 

Edward  “Bob”  Lewis  Bartlett  was  born  to  Edward  and  Ida  Bartlett  at  Seattle,  King  County, 
Washington,  on  April  20,  1904.  Edward  Bartlett  married  Vide  Gaustad  on  August  14,

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

U.S.  Senator  Bartlett  was  approached  by  the  Director  of  the  Alaska  Human  Rights 
Commission,  Willard  L.  Bowman,  regarding  the  plight  of  the  Pribilof  Islands’  Native 
population.  Bartlett  took  up  the  charge  with  the  support  of  Bowman,  the  editors  of  the 
Tundra  Times,  and  “their  friends.”  Senator  Bartlett  visited  St.  Paul  Island  on  September 
9  and  10,  1965.  In  addition  to  touring  seal  rookeries,  private  homes,  and  the  school,  he 
met  with  members  of  the  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  communities  to  discuss  his  pending 
legislation,  which  on  June  7,  1965,  he  presented  before  the  89th  Congress,  1st  Session, 
as  S.  2102.  The  bill  became  the  Fur-Seal  Act  of  1966,  which  paved  the  way  toward  self- 
determination  for  the  Pribilof  Aleuts  and  assured  them  of  their  full  rights  as  citizens  of 
the  United  States.21

Biographical  Sketch 

John  Beaman  attended  Williston  Seminary  in  pursuit  of  a  ministry  vocation  and  later  en¬ 
tered  Amherst  College,  in  the  1863-64  academic  year.  He  enlisted  on  January  4, 1864,  as  a 
private  in  Nims  Battery,  2nd  Massachusetts  Light  Artillery.  He  received  his  discharge  on 
June  5,  1865,  after  being  hospitalized  as  a  prisoner  of  war  at  Hopewell  General  Hospital 
in  Alexandria,  Virginia.  At  Hopewell,  while  recovering  from  frostbite  and  exposure,  he 
met  his  future  wife,  Elizabeth  Dubois,  who  was  serving  as  a  nurse.  Before  their  marriage,

she  convinced  Beaman  to  pursue  a  career  in  engineering.  In  1867,  after  the  Civil  War, 
Beaman  entered  Rensselaer  Polytechnic  Institute  in  Troy,  New  York,  where  he  worked 
toward  a  degree  in  mine  engineering  until  1870.  He  participated  in  the  1870  Hayden 
Survey  to  New  Mexico  and  subsequently  served  as  a  civil  engineer  in  public  land  surveys 
throughout  the  United  States.  After  his  Pribilof  Islands  appointment,  he  became  a  mining 
engineer  in  Lewis,  Nevada,  and  later  Superintendent  of  Construction  of  Public  Buildings 
in  North  Hadley,  Massachusetts.  In  1902,  the  U.S.  Treasury  Department  sent  Beaman  to 
Greensboro,  North  Carolina,  to  oversee  post  office  and  government  building  construc¬ 
tion.23 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Much  of  what  we  know  of  John  Warren  Beaman’s  experiences  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  was 
recorded  in  detailed  journals  by  his  wife,  Elizabeth  “Libby”  Beaman,  which  her  grand¬ 
daughter  Betty  John  published  in  1987  as  the  book  Libby.  The  book  tells  of  Elizabeth 
making  a  plea  for  employment  for  her  husband  to  family  friend  and  U.S.  President 
Rutherford  B.  Hayes: 

“My  husband  was  with  the  [Geodetic]  Survey  Office.  You  abolished  it  six  months  ago.  Mr. 

Beaman  has  tried  to  find  work,  any  kind  of  work.  There  isn’t  any  work.  I  know  you  will  be 
angry  with  me  when  I  say  it  is  unfair  for  veterans  to  have  to  face  this — most  unfair  that 
someone  wounded  at  Red  River  should  have  to  walk  the  streets  looking  for  even  the  most 
menial  job.  The  men  who  fought  to  keep  this  nation  together  deserve  something  better 
than  that.”

“Yes,  a  trained  civil  engineer,  especially  trained  in  cartography. . . .”

Libby  did  not  let  her  husband  travel  to  the  Pribilofs  alone.  (The  book  Libby  claims

possibly  because  John  Beaman  was  dissatisfied  with  his  position,  or  because  of  Libby’s

about  Beaman’s  early  departure  in  his  1880  annual  report: 

Assistant  Agent  Beaman,  carrying  into  effect  a  threat  first  expressed  nearly  a  year  ago  and 
frequently  since,  has  for  personal  reasons  taken  the  responsibility  of  leaving  his  post  of  duty

of  my  own  previous  and  formal  disapproval  of  his  course.  He  embarked  from  St.  George

Boscowitz  and  Leah  Jane  (Phillips)  Boscowitz  of  Victoria,  B.C.28 

Biographical  Sketch 

Brothers  David  Aaron  and  Leopold  Joseph  Boscowitz  both  played  a  role  in  the  furrier 
business.  David  entered  Cambridge  University  in  1885.29  The  1898-1900  London  City 
Directory  listed  him  as  part  of  J.  Boscowitz  and  Sons,  fur  dealer.  As  a  spokesman  for 
the  Canadian  government,  Leopold  Joseph  Boscowitz  represented  Canadian  sealers  in 
London  during  the  1897  pelagic  sealing  controversy. 

Although  Leopold  Joseph  Boscowitz  declared  Canadian  sealers’  willingness  to  relin¬ 
quish  their  assets  for  a  price,  and  the  buyout  took  place,  not  all  the  sealers  were  pleased 
about  selling  their  boats  and  ending  their  pelagic  sealing  days  in  the  Bering  Sea.30

LONDON,  June  12— John  W.  Foster,  who  is  now  in  St.  Petersburg  [Russia],  is  expected  back  in 
London  on  July  1.  He  did  not  call  at  the  Foreign  Office  during  the  few  days  he  was  in  London, 
but  he  had  conferences  with  Col.  Hay,  and  on  the  day  previous  to  his  departure  he  had  an 
interview  of  nearly  an  hour  with  Mr.  Liebes  of  the  North  American  Commercial  Company, 
who  has  been  in  communication  with  the  Embassy  during  Mr.  Bayard’s  term  of  office  regarding 
the  false  statements  alleged  to  have  been  made  by  Canadian  sealers  respecting  the  sex  of  their 
catch.

During  the  interview  Mr.  Foster,  asked  as  to  the  propositions  he  was  to  lay  before  the  Russian 
Government,  replied  that  he  did  not  know  until  he  got  to  St.  Petersburg.  Mr.  Foster  was 
informed  by  Mr.  Liebes  that  his  going  to  Russia  and  any  arrangement  that  he  might  make  there 
would  not  be  binding  upon  England,  as  Great  Britain,  so  far  as  he  could  learn,  would  do  nothing 
in  the  matter  until  the  five  years  specified  by  the  Paris  award  had  expired.  The  Canadians, 
moreover,  said  Mr.  Liebes,  although  they  made  no  money  over  the  business,  would  not  be 
satisfied  to  give  in  unless  they  got  compensation. 

Mr.  Liebes  then  said  to  Mr.  Loster:  “I  will  be  very  willing,  personally,  to  pay  the  Canadians  any 
profits  they  have  made  during  the  past  three  years,  and  will  furnish  very  good  security  for  the 
amount,  provided  the  Governments  concerned  will  satisfy  the  Canadians  in  the  way  of  buying 
their  vessels.” 

“Would  they  be  satisfied?”  remarked  Mr.  Foster. 

Mr.  Liebes  replied:  “I  have  seen  here  Mr.  Leopold  Boscowitz,  son  of  Joseph  Boscowitz  of 
Victoria,  B.C.,  a  Canadian  sealer  having  large  interests,  and  he  said  to  me:  ‘I  assure  you  if  we  be 
compensated  for  our  vessels  the  question  can  be  settled  in  ten  minutes’  Mr.  Liebes  rejoined: 
“Have  you  authority  to  speak  for  any  one  besides  yourself?"  to  which  Mr.  Boscowitz  said:  “All 
the  Canadians  will  be  very  glad  to  be  bought  out.”

Genealogy 

Joseph  Boscowitz  and  his  brother,  Leopold,  na¬ 
tives  of  Floss,  Bavaria,  immigrated  to  Victoria, 
British  Columbia,  in  1860.  Joseph  lived  with  his 
family  at  both  Victoria  and  London,  England. 
Joseph  Boscowitz  married  a  Philadelphia  woman, 
Leah  Jane  Phillips,  in  December  1864,  at  Victoria. 
Joseph  and  Leah  Boscowitz  had  five  children: 
David  Aaron  (1866-1938),  Leopold  Joseph  (b. 
1868),  Barbara,  Leah,  and  Ada  Doris.  In  1923, 
Joseph  Boscowitz  died  in  Victoria  at  the  age  of 
eighty-eight.31 

Biographical  Sketch 

The  Boscowitz  brothers  initially  opened  a  to¬ 
bacco  shop  on  Yates  Street  in  Victoria.  In  1870, 
they  began  a  successful  fur  trade  business,  princi¬ 
pally  in  seal  pelts.  In  1877,  Joseph  Boscowitz  left 
Victoria  for  London  under  suspicion  of  alleged 
improprieties  regarding  the  issuance  of  deben¬

later,  Boscowitz,  his  wife,  and  some  of  their  children  returned  to  Victoria  to  expand  his 
business  investments,  including  J.  Boscowitz  and  Sons,  fur  dealers.32  In  1890,  Joseph  in¬ 
vested  further,  first  in  a  fleet  of  pelagic  sealing  vessels  and  then  beyond  sealing,  in  the 
Boscowitz  Steamship  Company,  the  Victoria  Theatre,  and  numerous  real  estate  holdings. 

In  1966,  James  I<.  Nesbitt  wrote  a  retrospective  about  Joseph  Boscowitz  that  includ¬ 
ed  his  personal,  political,  and  financial  activities;  it  was  published  in  The  Daily  Colonist 
under  the  title  “Boscowitz  Runs  the  Machine.”33  The  excerpt  below  was  extracted  by 
Nesbitt  from  a  special  edition  (1896)  of  The  Colonist: 

One  of  the  oldest  and  largest  commercial  enterprises  of  British  Columbia  is  that  of  J. 

Boscowitz  and  Sons,  fur  dealers  at  Fort  and  Wharf  Streets.  Thirty-five  years  ago  this 
enterprise  was  inaugurated,  and  from  the  outset  has  been  steadily  growing  until  the  present 
extensive  proportions  have  been  reached. 

Furs  of  all  kinds  are  dealt  in,  the  specialty  being  seal  skins,  and  an  idea  of  the  business  done 
in  these  may  be  gleaned  from  the  fact  that  the  firm  maintains  four  large  sealing  schooners 
and  handles,  on  an  average,  about  20,000  skins  a  year. 

The  highest  cash  prices  are  paid,  while  cash  advances  are  made  on  consignments,  on 
shipments  to  Europe,  in  fitting  out  schooners  for  sealing,  for  fur  trading,  salmon,  and 
on  cannery  supplies.  The  greater  portion  of  the  skins  bought  by  the  firm  is  sold  direct 
to  London  dealers.  The  operation  of  the  firm  has  always  been  characterized  by  liberality 
and  reliability.  Mr.  Joseph  Boscowitz  is  a  young  man  of  ability,  and  is  doing  a  great  deal  to 
advance  the  interests  of  the  firm.34 

Joseph  Boscowitz  “retired  from  active  business  with  the  wiping  out  of  the  sealing 
industry,”35  after  the  1911  Fur-Seal  Treaty  was  signed  by  Great  Britain  (representing 
Canada),  the  United  States,  Japan  and  Russia.

Fur  Dealer,  Boscowitz  and  Sons,  Victoria,  British  Columbia,  Canada,  1870  to  circa  1880 
Genealogy 

Leopold  Boscowitz  and  his  brother,  Joseph,  natives  of  Floss,  Bavaria,  immigrated  to 
Victoria,  British  Columbia,  in  1860.  The  two  brothers  initially  opened  a  tobacco  shop  on 
Yates  Street  in  Victoria.  In  1870,  they  began  a  successful  business  in  the  seal-pelt  trade. 

Leopold  Boscowitz  married  Margaretha  (Margaret)  Simon,  born  about  1821  in 
Salzungen,  Germany.  Margaretha  was  the  daughter  of  Michael  Simon  and  Christine 
(Erbe)  Simon. 

Leopold  Boscowitz’s  obituary  in  the  New  York  Times  on  the  day  after  his  death  at  his 
New  York  City  home  read: 

Leopold  Boscowitz,  a  retired  merchant,  died  suddenly  at  his  home,  130  East  Fifty-Sixth 
Street,  from  paralysis  of  the  brain.  He  was  sixty-three  years  old,  and  was  born  in  Floss, 

Bavaria.  He  came  to  this  country  in  1860,  and  settled  in  San  Francisco,  where  he  engaged 
in  the  tobacco  business.  Later  he  became  a  member  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company 
that  was  formed  after  the  purchase  of  Alaska  for  the  purpose  of  catching  seals.  He  retired 
from  business  about  fifteen  years  ago,  after  having  accumulated  a  fortune.  He  leaves  a  wife, 
whose  maiden  name  was  Miss  Margaret  Simons.36 

After  her  husband’s  death,  Margaret  Boscowitz  married  Ernst  H.  Bauer  on  June  21, 
1897.  She  died  March  29,  1902,  in  Manhattan,  New  York.37 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

The  Boscowitz  family  became  a  significant  force  in  the  Victoria,  British  Columbia,  mer¬ 
cantile  industry  and  exerted  considerable  influence  in  the  fur-seal  industry,  particularly 
with  respect  to  the  pelagic  sealing  fishery. 

Leopold,  fur  buyer,  a  resident  of  Victoria,  and  a  British  subject,  associated  with  his 
brother  Joseph.  In  1867  Boscowitz  was  on  the  spot  in  Sitka  as  soon  as  word  spread  of 
the  impending  transfer  [of  Russian  America  to  the  United  States].  Prince  Maksutov,  the 
governor  of  Russian  America,  is  said  to  have  told  him  that  he  could  buy  all  the  furs  that 
were  in  the  company  warehouses  in  Sitka  at  the  established  prices  at  which  the  RAC 
[Russian-American  Company]  had  been  selling  them.  The  cautious  Boscowitz  took  [only] 

16,000  fur-seal  skins  at  the  rock  bottom  price  of  forty  cents  apiece,  and  shipped  them  to 
Victoria,  where  they  sold  for  two  to  three  dollars  apiece.  When  he  received  word  from 
Victoria  of  his  success,  Boscowitz  tried  to  secure  the  remainder  of  the  skins,  but  meanwhile 
Maksutov  had  received  orders  not  to  sell  any  more. 

Boscowitz,  in  the  fur  trade,  and  a  fellow  resident  of  Victoria,  William  Kohl,  who  was 
in  shipping,  were  well  known  to  each  other.  After  the  transfer  both  went  to  Sitka  at 
approximately  the  same  time.  They  presumably  heard  that  Captain  Gustave  Niebaum,  a 
Russian  American  Company  (RAC)  skipper,  with  four  associates,  had  bought  from  Prince 
Maksutov  the  RAC  brig  Konstantin  (Constantine)  and  were  fitting  her  out  for  a  voyage  to 
the  Pribylov  Islands  to  pick  up  a  cargo  of  sealskins  to  be  taken  to  San  Francisco  for  sale. 

Boscowitz  and  Kohl  appear  to  have  come  together  with  the  idea  of  arranging  to  acquire 
the  cargo  upon  its  arrival  in  San  Francisco,  so  Boscowitz  evidently  thought  of  Adolf 
Wasserman,  a  well-placed  San  Francisco  fur  dealer.  Therefore,  Boscowitz  and  Kohl  left 
Sitka  together  for  San  Francisco  on  the  John  L.  Stephens,  arriving  22  November  [1867]. 

They  joined  forces  with  Wasserman  and  on  18  January  1868  returned  to  Sitka  on  the 


163 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


steamer  Fideliter  (Erskine).  In  Sitka  Boscowitz  and  Kohl  found  another  entrepreneur,  H. 

W.  Hutchinson,  who  represented  a  group  which  included  Abraham  Hirsch,  and  the  San 
Francisco  merchants  Louis  Sloss  and  Louis  Gerstle.  Hutchinson,  in  a  business  coup  had 
first  made  a  bulk  purchase  of  RAC  moveable  goods  from  Prince  Maksutov. 

Hutchinson,  Kohl,  and  Boscowitz  were  together  for  some  time  in  Sitka  and  on  24  January 
1868,  left  on  the  same  ship  as  Prince  Maksutov  reaching  San  Francisco  on  February  5.  At 
Sitka,  or  on  shipboard,  they  probably  agreed  to  combine  forces.  There  they  got  together 
with  their  respective  San  Francisco  associates,  Sloss  and  Gerstle,  and  Wasserman,  and  by 
the  beginning  of  March  had  united  as  Hutchinson,  Kohl  and  Company.  When  Niebaum 
arrived  in  the  Constantine  on  2  March  with  a  cargo  of  sealskins,  which  he  delivered  to 
Wasserman,  he  too  was  offered  an  association  with  the  new  firm.  Presumably  Niebaum’s 
four  associates  declined  or  were  bought  out.  Now  there  were  seven;  an  eighth  partner,  John 
F.  Miller,  was  brought  in  1870. 

In  October  1868  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  was  formed,  at  first  virtually 
synonymous  with  the  Hutchinson,  Kohl  Company.  Passage  on  1  July  1870  of  legislation 
authorizing  an  exclusive  twenty-year  sealing  lease  of  the  Pribylov  Islands  to  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company  began  a  two-year  changeover  of  Hutchinson,  Kohl  interests  to 
the  Alaska  Commercial  Company.  Boscowitz,  not  being  an  American  citizen  and  hence 
excluded  by  terms  of  the  lease,  was  eliminated  in  early  1872,  having  to  sell  1,400  shares 
to  Mark  Livingston,  another  German-Jewish  pioneer  merchant  in  San  Francisco  and  a 
close  friend  of  Wasserman,  who  probably  interested  him  [Livingston]  in  the  investment. 
Returning  from  San  Francisco  on  14  March  1871,  he  [Boscowitz]  thereafter  remained  in 
Victoria  as  a  property  owner  and  furrier,  making  frequent  visits  to  Europe.38

“Ward  Bower  leaves  a  magnificent  record  of  achievement  in  the  field  of  conservation,  and 
his  retirement  will  be  distinctly  felt,"  said  Mr.  Day.  “His  is  the  longest  record  of  continuous 
service  in  Federal  fisheries  work.  In  his  years  of  duty,  he  has  become  a  specialist  on  Alaska, 
and  an  authority  on  the  aquatic  resources  of  that  great  Territory.  Under  his  administration 
. . .  the  North  Pacific  fur  seal  herd  had  increased  from  125,000  animals  in  1911  to  more 
than  3,300,000  today,  and  through  wise  management  during  this  period  of  growth,  about 
1,300,000  sealskins  have  been  taken  from  surplus  male  animals  to  enrich  the  Treasury  of 
the  United  States  by  more  than  10  million  dollars. 

This  outstanding  accomplishment  in  the  field  of  wildlife  restoration  is  only  one  of  the 
monuments  to  Mr.  Bower’s  tireless  devotion  to  the  cause  of  conservation.  In  addition,  he 
has  had  a  guiding  hand  in  the  development  and  management  of  the  valuable  salmon  and 
other  commercial  fisheries  of  Alaska,  directing  and  encouraging  the  research  on  which

Ward  T.  Bower  came  by  his  interest  in  fishery  conservation  naturally. . . .  [H]is  father, 
Seymour  Bower,  was  for  20  years  the  active  head  of  the  Michigan  Fish  Commission,  the 
forerunner  of  the  present  Department  of  Conservation  of  Michigan.  Educated  in  Detroit, 
Mr.  Bower  joined  the  staff  of  the  U.S.  Fish  Commission  as  an  apprentice  fish  culturist  on 
July  1,  1900,  at  the  fish  cultural  station  at  Northville,  Michigan.  This  organization  in  1903, 
was  designated  as  the  Bureau  of  Fisheries  and  in  1940,  it  was  merged  with  the  Biological 
Survey  to  form  the  present  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service. 

For  the  first  ten  years  of  his  service,  Mr.  Bower  was  identified  with  fish  cultural  activities, 
holding  positions  of  responsibility  at  stations  in  Michigan,  Minnesota,  and  California,  and 
finally  going  to  the  Washington  office  as  Superintendent  of  fish  distribution.  In  1911,  Mr. 
Bower  entered  full  time  work  in  the  Division  of  Alaska  Fisheries  with  which  he  has  been 
associated  continuously  ever  since,  holding  variously  the  positions  of  Inspector,  Assistant 
Agent,  Agent,  Administrative  Officer,  and  Chief.  During  the  years  since  1911,  he  has  spent 
many  months  in  Alaska,  and  in  1922  he  accompanied  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  Commerce 
on  a  world  cruise  to  investigate  the  maritime  industries  and  economic  conditions  in 
Russia,  Japan,  China,  India,  Egypt,  France,  Italy,  Germany,  Belgium,  the  British  Isles,  and 
elsewhere. 

Mr.  Bower  has  been  a  member  of  the  American  Fisheries  Society  since  1900,  an  officer  of 

the  Society  for  five  terms,  and  editor  of  its  publications  two  different  years - Mr.  Bower  is 

the  author  of  more  than  40  publications  on  a  variety  of  subjects  in  the  fields  of  fish  culture, 
aquarium  management,  fishery  conservation,  marine  mammals,  and  Alaska.”41

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Willard  Bowman  became  the  first  Executive 
Director  for  the  Alaska  State  Committee  for 
Human  Rights  and  served  from  1963  to  1975. 
Later  he  was  Chairman  of  the  Alaska  State  House 
Rules  Committee.  He  investigated  administrative 
procedures  governing  the  Pribilof  Aleuts  after 
the  Tundra  Times  wrote  extensively  about  living 
standards  on  the  islands.  He  “allied  himself  with 
the  editor  of  [the  Tundra  Times],  and  assistant 
editor  Thomas  A.  Snapp,  in  fighting  for  the  rights 
of  the  Pribilof  people.  Bowman  did  much  to  bring 
about  the  desired  end  from  the  standpoint  of  the  native  citizens.  He  battled  those  who 
would  only  whitewash  a  bad  situation.”44  Later,  Senator  E.  L.  Bartlett  became  involved, 
and  the  three  worked  together  to  help  address  human  rights  problems  involving  the 
Pribilof  Aleut  population.  Bowman  “was  a  great  humanitarian.  He  did  not  live  in  vain.  He 
achieved  better  things  in  life  for  people  no  matter  who  they  were.”45

He  was  also  an  active  member  of  the  NAACP  in 
Anchorage.  He  was  elected  to  the  State  House  of 
Representatives  in  three  consecutive  elections 
(1970,  1972,  and  1974).  Representative  Bowman 
was  one  of  the  first  Black  Americans  to  serve  in

Buterin,  James  P.  (1857-1883) 

School  Teacher,  St.  Paul  Island,  1878-1882 
Biographical  Sketch 

James  Buterin,  Chief  Karp  Buterin’s  younger  brother,  left  St.  Paul  Island  on  September  9, 
1872,  at  age  fifteen  for  schooling  in  San  Francisco.46  He  later  went  to  Rutland,  Vermont, 
at  the  direction  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  (ACC),  which  began  to  send  prom¬ 
ising  young  Aleuts  off  the  island  for  their  education;  he  was  the  first  person  so  sent.47 
He  returned  to  St.  Paul  Island  on  May  12,  1878,  aboard  the  ACC  steamer  St.  Paul  to 
teach  at  the  school.  His  first  year  of  teaching  began  on  September  2,  1878,  with  forty  stu¬ 
dents;  the  school  year  ended  on  May  8,  1879.  Comments  in  the  Agent’s  Log  and  Agent’s 
Annual  Report  praised  his  service:  “Mr.  Butrin  is  worthy  of  commendation  for  the  faith¬ 
ful  manner  in  which  he  has  [unreadable]  discharged  his  arduous  duties.  A  great  deal  of 
difficulty  has  been  experienced  in  compelling  the  individual  attendance  of  many  of  the 
children  for  the  reason  that,  with  a  few  exceptions,  the  parents  are  perfectly  indifferent 
about  it,  and  in  some  cases  have  made  all  sorts  of  excuses  to  prevent  their  children  from 
attending  regularly.”  The  agent  took  effort  to  mention  that  student  Julia  Kushin  was  pres¬ 
ent  every  day  during  the  term.48 

On  St.  Paul  Island  the  school  is  fortunate  in  being  conducted  by  a  native  teacher,  James 
Buterin,  who  possesses  a  good  English  education,  and  much  industry,  tact,  and  energy.  The 
attendance  at  the  last  term  [1879]  averaged  39  out  of  a  total  enrollment  of  42  pupils.49 

James  Buterin  continued  as  teacher  on  St.  Paul  Island  until  the  close  of  the  school 
year,  May  15,  1882.  Ill  health  had  plagued  him  throughout  the  school  year  and  forced 
him  to  leave  the  Pribilofs.  He  departed  on  July  28,  1882,  aboard  the  steamer  St.  Paul  to 
seek  medical  care  on  the  West  Coast.50  James  Buterin  died  in  California  in  March  1883 
of  consumption.51 


Buterin,  Karp  (b.  1851) 

Aleut  Chief,  St.  Paul  Island,  1891-1893 
Genealogy 

Karp  Buterin  was  born  October  25,  1851,  on  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska.52  Karp  was  the  son 
of  Chief  Kerick  Bootrin  and  Lokeli  (aka  Lokelia)  Bootrin  (1819-1875).  Karp  Buterin  mar¬ 
ried  Parascovia  (surname  unknown)  born  August  7,  1854  in  Unalaska,  Alaska.  Parascovia 
Buterin  died  on  St.  Paul  Island,  March  10,  1923.53  Karp  Buterin  died  sometime  after 
1928.54 

Biographical  Sketch 

Agent  George  Tingle  spoke  highly  of  Karp  Buterin’s  father,  Chief  Kerick  Bootrin,  in  his 
1888  testimony  before  a  congressional  committee:  “Old  Kerrick  Booterin,  the  most  intel¬ 
ligent  native  of  the  islands,  told  me  that  under  Russian  rule  he  was  the  highest  salaried

man  on  the  islands.  That  he  was  the  head  carpen¬ 
ter  and  the  highest  payment  he  ever  received  from 
Russia  in  one  year  was  $60.  That  man  now  receives 
about  $600,  or  a  little  over,  in  cash.  He  has  charge  of 
the  boats,  and  is  one  of  the  first-class  men.”55 

Karp  Buterin’s  mother,  Lokeli  Bootrin,  died 
February  26,  1875,  of  bronchitis  at  age  fifty-six. 
According  to  Agent  Charles  Bryant,  she  was  the 
oldest  woman  on  St.  Paul  Island.  She  had  served 
as  head  housekeeper  for  the  Russian-American 
Company,  and  she  continued  in  the  same  capac¬ 
ity  for  Hutchinson,  Kohl,  &  Co.  and  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company  until  the  fall  of  1872,  when 
she  went  to  Unalaska  to  spend  the  winter  with 
friends.  “She  has  always  been  a  bright  character  for 
honesty  and  faithfulness  and  is  more  respected  than 
any  other  native  woman  on  the  island.”56 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Karp  Buterin,  head  chief  at  St.  Paul  Island,  gave  the 
following  deposition  [excerpted]  to  the  Tribunal 
of  Arbitration  before  Treasury  Agent-in-Charge 
William  H.  Williams  at  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska,  on 
June  9,  1892: 


I  am  39  years  of  age  and  I  was  born  on  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska,  and  I  have  always  lived 
here.  I  have  a  practical  knowledge  of  the  fur-seal  industry  as  it  is  done  on  St.  Paul  Island, 
for  I  have  been  working  at  it  all  of  my  life  since  I  was  able  to  work.  I  have  driven  seals  and 
clubbed  and  skinned  them;  I  have  had  charge  of  the  drives  and  I  have  been  second  chief  for 
four  years,  and  I  am  head  chief  now,  being  elected  in  1891.  As  chief  it  is  my  duty  to  see  that 
the  rookeries  are  not  troubled  by  anyone,  to  teach  my  people  to  obey  the  law  and  my  young 
men  how  to  drive  seals  to  the  killing  grounds  without  injuring  them.57 

The  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s  Log  often  provided  anecdotal  glimpses  of  everyday  life  on 
the  island.  An  entry  on  October  11,  1897,  made  mention  of  Karp  Buterin. 

Aggie  Kushin,  Nicoli  Krukoff  and  Markel  Volkoff  with  a  force  of  Assistants,  were  to  remove 
the  shed  of  the  Billiard  hall  over  to  Karp  Buterin’s,  where  it  will  be  joined  to  Karp’s  house  as 
an  addition.

Biographies  B  ♦  Buterin  -  Buynitzky 


Buynitzky,  Stephen  Nestor  (1832-1903) 

Special  Agent,  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury,  St.  George  Island,  1870 
First  Schoolteacher  on  St.  George  Island 

Special  Agent,  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury,  St.  Paul  Island,  July  1871-April  1872 
Genealogy 

Stephen  Buynitzky  was  born  in  December  1832,  at  Disna,  Russia.  According  to  a  family 
genealogist,  Stephen  Buynitzky  left  Russia  circa  1861.  Stephen  married  Carolina  Petsch, 
daughter  of  Julius  and  Eleanor  Picker,  in  Washington,  D.C.,  around  1870.  Stephen  and 
Carolina  Buynitzky  had  three  children:  Julius  Stephen  (1874-1977),  who  became  a  drug¬ 
gist  in  Washington,  D.C.;  Eleanor  (1880-1917),  who  became  an  assistant  in  the  National 
Weather  Service  library;  and  Alexander  (1888-1970),  who  clerked  in  the  U.S.  Navy 
Department.  Stephen  Buynitzky  died  in  Washington,  D.C.,  April  3,  1903.58 

Biographical  Sketch 

Mr.  Buynitzky  came  to  the  United  States  with  an  interesting  legacy  and  gifted  talent. 

Stephen  was  once  a  Baron  but  left  that  title  and  his  son  Alex  behind  in  Russia  because 
the  son  would  have  lost  his  land  and  his  title  had  he  left  the  country.  Stephen  left  Russia 
around  1861  probably  because  political  change  was  about  to  claim  all  his  wealth.  Here  in 
this  country  he  became  affectionately  known  as  the  Baron.  He  was  a  founder  of  a  French 
Society  in  DC  and  his  obituary  states  that  they  began  his  memorial  service  with  the  Polish 
National  Anthem  because  it  was  where  he  was  born.59 

In  1868,  Julius  Petsch  [his  future  father-in-law]  of  Hanover,  Prussia,  and  Stephen  Buynitzky 
of  St.  Petersburg,  Russia,  jointly  filed  a  U.S.  Patent  for  an  ingenious  vacuum  coffee  brewer 
consisting  of  an  integrated  pot  with  internal  upper  and  lower  chambers,  suspended  by 
trunnions  from  a  stand  over  a  spirit  heater.  Due  to  the  asymmetrical  shapes  of  the  two 
chambers,  when  the  water  rises  to  the  upper  chamber,  the  pot  becomes  unbalanced  and 
tips  to  the  side.  This  process  extinguishes  the  heater,  and  when  the  vacuum  pulls  the 
brewed  coffee  back  into  the  lower  chamber,  the  pot  swings  back  to  vertical,  simultaneously 
tripping  a  small  hammer  which  then  strikes  a  bell  to  indicate  that  the  coffee  is  ready.60 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

In  addition  to  being  an  agent  at  St.  George,  Stephen  Buynitzky  founded  the  island’s  first 
American  school  and  briefly  served  as  schoolteacher  in  1870.  In  1871,  Buynitzky  pub¬ 
lished  a  book  through  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  about  the  Aleut  language  titled 
English- Aleutian  Vocabulary  (Sail  [San]  Francisco:  Alta  California  Book  and  Job  Printing 
House.  No.  529  California  Street,  1871.)  A  copy  of  this  rare  book  is  located  in  the  Loussac 
Library,  Anchorage. 

Mr.  Buynitzky  provided  the  following  information  about  himself  during  two  investi¬ 
gations  of  the  Fur  Seal  Islands: 

I  am  a  Russian  by  birth  and  am  60  years  of  age.  I  graduated  from  the  Imperial  Lyceum  at  St. 
Petersburg,  an  institution  for  the  nobility.  I  am  now  a  resident  of  the  city  of  Washington.61 

...  I  am  now  a  citizen  of  the  United  States - My  first  orders  from  the  Treasury 

Department  bore  date  May  25,  1870.  That  was  some  time  before  the  act  in  relation  to  this

matter  [the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  lease]  was  passed.  There  was  no  near  prospect 
of  the  act  being  passed  at  that  session,  as  the  session  was  then  far  advanced,  and  the 
expectation  of  Secretary  Boutwell,  I  understood,  was  that  no  legislation  on  the  subject 
would  be  had  that  session.  At  the  same  time  he  knew  that  the  natives  there  were  destitute, 
he  having  prohibited  any  vessels  from  landing  there  while  the  question  of  the  management 
of  the  island  was  pending  before  Congress.  My  instructions  were,  acting  under  the  orders 
of  Captain  Bryant,  the  special  agent  of  the  Treasury  Department,  to  assist  him  in  taking 
charge,  for  the  time  being,  of  the  two  islands.  I  reported  to  Captain  Bryant,  and  was  put 
in  charge  of  Saint  George,  while  he  himself  sailed  to  Saint  Paul.  We  had  a  small  lot  of 
provisions,  such  as  salt,  flour,  etc.,  and  were  expecting  our  orders  and  further  news  from 
the  States.  In  that  condition  we  remained  there  about  three  months.  At  the  end  of  the  three 
months  (on  the  12th  of  October,  1870)  the  steamer  Constantine  arrived  at  Saint  George, 
and  brought  to  the  agents  of  the  Alaska  Company  a  copy  of  the  act  of  July  1,  and  a  copy 
of  the  orders  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  to  allow  that  company  to  take  possession  of 
the  skins  which  had  accumulated  on  the  island  at  the  time.  It  also  brought  orders  to  myself 
to  proceed  to  Washington  and  resume  my  duties  as  clerk  in  the  office  of  the  Secretary.  At 
that  period  I  was  acting  in  utter  ignorance  of  any  law  having  been  passed  by  Congress  in 
regard  to  the  management  of  fur-seal  fisheries,  and  of  any  lease  having  been  granted  to  any 
one.  I  immediately  left  and  returned  to  Washington. . . .  The  second  time  I  was  ordered 
to  proceed  to  the  island  of  Saint  Paul,  there  to  report  to  Captain  Bryant,  who  was  then  in 
charge,  and  to  act  entirely  under  his  orders  so  long  as  he  wanted  my  services  there,  and  in 
case  he  should  conclude  to  go  to  Washington,  that  I  should  remain  on  the  island  of  Saint 
Paul  and  take  charge  of  his  duties.  Captain  Bryant  concluded  to  go  to  Washington,  and 
gave  me  orders  to  remain  on  the  island.62

25  Libby  was  not  the  first  white  woman  to  visit  the  islands.  For  example,  the  wives  of  Capt.  Charles 
Bryant  and  Dr.  Hugh  McIntyre  accompanied  their  husbands  to  St.  Paul  Island  at  least  as  early  as 
1871.  Betty  John’s  book  exercised  creative  license  about  certain  aspects  of  life  and  conditions  on  the 
island.  For  example,  her  mention  of  blue  butterflies  has  not  been  confirmed  and  her  confinement  in 
her  living  quarters  for  over  two  months  during  the  winter  of  1880  is  not  substantiated  by  the  Agent’s 
Logs  (John,  Libby,  159-168).  Also,  Libby’s  diary  stated  that  she  and  her  husband  departed  St.  Paul 
Island  Aug.  3,  1880  (p.  197),  whereas  the  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s  Log  stated  that  they  departed  on  July 
30,  1880.

Lost  Creek,  Indiana,  where  he  was  educated  and 

worked  on  the  family  farm.  He  graduated  from  the  University  of  Indiana  June  17,  1896, 
with  a  BA  degree  in  zoology.  He  studied  with  ichthyologists  Carl  Eigenmann  and  Barton 
W.  Evermann  at  the  University  of  Indiana  before  his  appointment  as  scientific  assistant 
with  the  U.S.  Fish  Commission  in  1897.  His  position  as  assistant  naturalist  afforded 
him  experience  aboard  the  Fish  Commission’s  steamer  Albatross  to  the  Bering  Sea,  the 
Hawaiian  Islands,  and  the  South  Pacific.  In  1903,  Chamberlain  was  appointed  naturalist 
for  the  Albatross  and  charged  with  responsibility  for  the  natural  history  collections  gath¬ 
ered  by  members  of  the  scientific  research  vessel.  He  participated  in  expeditions  inves¬ 
tigating  the  Alaska  salmon  fisheries  during  1901  and  1903  and  a  Hawaiian  expedition  in 
1902.  His  last  tour  was  with  Louis  Agassiz’s  Philippine  expedition  in  1907.  Chamberlain 
resigned  his  post  as  naturalist  for  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Fisheries  in  1911  to  accept  the  posi¬ 
tion  of  agent  for  the  Alaskan  salmon  fisheries.  Subsequently,  he  became  naturalist  and 
agent  at  St.  Paul  Island  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  in  1913.5 


Chamberlain’s  “many  contributions  to  the  marine  sciences  include  pioneering  studies 
of  salmon  and  native  fish  populations  in  Alaska  and  California,  collections  of  thousands 
of  natural  history  specimens  on  board  the  Albatross,  design  and  construction  of  collect¬

Newly  appointed  Agent  Fred  Chamberlain  landed  at  St.  Paul  Island  on  July  13,  1913, 
and  by  July  15  had  taken  ill  and  become  bedridden.  On  August  24,  the  island’s  physician, 
Dr.  McGovern,  issued  a  diagnosis  of  consumption  (tuberculosis).  Dr.  McGovern  advised 
Chamberlain  to  leave  as  soon  as  possible  if  he  had  any  desire  to  recover;  otherwise  he

would  likely  perish  within  three  months.7  The  cutter  Manning  arrived  within  a  week  of  a 
request  to  move  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Chamberlain  off-island.  The  Agent’s  Log  noted: 

Put  Mr.  Chamberlain  in  a  cot  with  mattress  and  springs  and  hauled  him  to  east  landing 
with  wagon  and  mules  at  10:30  A.M.,  and  carried  him  to  MANNING  in  our  surf  boat. 
MANNING’S  crew  hoisted  him  aboard  with  blocks  and  tackle  attached  to  the  cot.  The  sea 
was  smooth  and  the  whole  trip  was  made  without  a  single  jolt  or  shake  up  for  the  patient.* 

Philip  Hatton,  who  began  his  Pribilof  Islands  career  in  1911  as  a  teacher,  assumed 
Chamberlain’s  responsibilities  as  agent.  Hatton  would  come  under  investigation  within 
another  year  for  gross  malfeasance  (see  Alvin  Whitney’s  biography  for  additional  details).

Genealogy 

Harry  D.  Chichester  was  born  April  20,  1872,  in  Port  Lavaca,  Texas,  son  of  Elijah  Chich¬ 
ester  (1846-1904)  and  grandson  of  the  Reverend  Elijah  Chichester  of  Lansingburgh,  New 
York.  Harry’s  mother  was  Maria  (Brown)  Chichester,  born  1849  in  Louisiana,  of  John 
Leopold  Brown  and  Elizabeth  Frances  (Marr)  Brown.  In  1910,  Harry  Chichester  married 
Emilie  A.  Perpall.  Emilie  Chichester  died  November  7,  1970,  in  Cincinnati,  Ohio;9  Harry 
Chichester  died  at  St.  Paul  Island  on  May  31,  1911. 

Biographical  Sketch 

Harry  Chichester  received  a  public  school  education  and  graduated  from  George 
Washington  University  medical  school  in  1910.  He  worked  as  a  car  accountant  for  the 
Southern  Pacific  Railroad  and  as  a  clerk  for  the  Customs  and  Freight  Department  with 
the  Mexican  International  Railroad  before  his  experiences  at  the  Alaska  Fur-Seal  Islands. 
His  wife,  Emilie  A.  Perpall  Chichester,  became  a  librarian  in  Brooklyn,  New  York,  after 
returning  from  the  Pribilof  Islands  following  her  husband’s  death.10 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Harry  Chichester  first  came  to  Alaska  as  an  assistant  to  Special  Agent  Joseph  Stanley- 
Brown  in  1892.  He  remained  in  service  as  agent  for  the  Pribilof  Islands  lessee,  the  North 
American  Commercial  Company.  Although  his  duty  station  was  in  Unalaska  from  May 
1893  to  1900,  he  frequented  the  Pribilofs  as  the  company’s  agent.  In  1898,  he  published 
a  book  of  his  photographs  entitled  Seals  and  the  Seal  Islands.  The  American  Museum 
of  Natural  History  in  New  York  City  maintains  an  archival  collection  of  some  347  of

inch  glass  plates  includes  Alaska  and  Pribilof  Islands  subjects  as  well  as  subjects  from 
elsewhere  in  North  America,  the  Arctic,  and  the  Yukon.11 


On  April  27,  1901,  Chichester  became  assistant  agent  for  Alaskan  seal  fisheries  at 
a  salary  of  $2,190  per  annum.  His  first  assignment  was  at  St.  George  Island,  where  he 
served  from  1901  to  1909.  In  that  time  he  worked  on  the  islands  only  during  the  sealing 
season  and  attended  college  during  the  off  season. 


In  1906,  Chichester  had  an  encounter  with  a  foreign  vessel  that  speaks  to  the  pres¬ 
ence  of  marauders  in  the  islands. 


Notwithstanding  the  presence  of  so  many  Japanese  schooners  in  the  close  vicinity  of 
the  islands,  no  actual  attempts  were  made  by  them  to  raid  the  rookeries  on  St.  George 
Island.  One  schooner,  however,  after  having  approached  the  St.  George  village  landing  the 
previous  day,  sent  several  boats  ashore  on  September  5  at  Garden  Cove.  Upon  discovery 
Agent  Chichester  and  a  native  guard  proceeded  to  the  cove  and  found  only  one  man  from 
the  schooner  ashore.  On  approach  of  Agent  Chichester’s  party  this  man,  a  Japanese,  hailed 
the  ship,  which  was  close  inshore,  asking  the  captain  of  the  schooner  to  come  to  the  beach. 
The  latter  in  a  small  boat  manned  by  three  sailors  came  ashore  in  response  to  the  hail, 
and  all  were  placed  under  arrest  with  the  man  already  ashore.  The  captain  stated  to  Mr.

Statutes  which  they  violated  (section  1959),  which  forbids  landing  on  the  islands  without  a 
permit,  unfortunately,  carried  no  penalty  other  than  summary  removal  from  the  islands.12 

In  1910,  Harry  Chichester  returned  to  St.  Paul  Island  as  the  newly  married  Dr. 
Chichester,  having  graduated  as  a  Doctor  of  Medicine  from  George  Washington 
University  on  June  9  of  that  year.  Within  a  year’s  time,  Dr.  Chichester  would  succumb  in 
a  tragic  accident. 

On  May  31,  1911,  a  distressing  accident  occurred  on  St.  Paul  Island.  Dr.  Harry  D. 

Chichester,  assistant  agent,  and  Dr.  Walter  L.  Hahn,  the  naturalist  on  the  seal  islands,  with 
their  wives  and  a  native,  Neon  Tetof  [sic;  see  Tetoff’s  biography],  while  sailing  on  the  lagoon 
were  unable  to  put  about  successfully  in  the  high  wind  and  by  the  capsizing  of  their  boat 
were  exposed  to  the  ice-cold  water  for  more  than  an  hour.  All  were  alive  when  rescued,  and 
Mrs.  Chichester  and  Mrs.  Hahn,  by  the  diligent  efforts  of  the  physician  were  resuscitated. 

The  native  also  survived,  but  Dr.  Chichester  and  Dr.  Hahn,  necessarily  left  without  medical 
attention  for  a  time,  succumbed  to  the  effects  of  the  exposure. 

In  addition  to  looking  after  all  business  and  administrative  affairs  of  the  islands  ...  Dr. 

Chichester  . . .  having  graduated  in  medicine  in  the  preceding  spring  and  during  his 
medical  course  he  had  given  special  attention  to  those  diseases,  such  as  pulmonary 
infections  which  are  most  prevalent  among  the  Aleuts.  These  studies  and  his  intimate 
knowledge  of  the  conditions  on  the  seal  islands  led  him  to  believe  that  all  infectious 
diseases  can  be  completely  eradicated  in  those  restricted  localities,  and,  inspired  by  this 
ambition  and  hope,  he  entered  vigorously  upon  the  securing  of  the  vital  and  statistical  data 
necessary  to  enable  him  to  formulate  a  definite  method  of  procedure.  The  progress  he  had 
made  was  so  encouraging  as  to  induce  the  belief  that  had  he  lived,  Dr.  Chichester  would 
have  realized  his  ambition  completely.  Unquestionably,  he  would  have  been  able  greatly  to 
improve  health  conditions  on  the  Pribilofs.13 


BRIDE  IS  AN  ARCTIC  WIDOW 

Charles  C.  Perpall,  a  Government  weigher,  living  at  100  Marlborough  Road,  Brooklyn,  received 
a  telegram  yesterday  from  his  daughter,  who,  eleven  months  ago,  left  home  to  marry  Dr.  Harry 
Dennison  Chichester  and  go  with  him  to  Alaska.  The  telegram  told  of  the  death  of  her  husband, 
and  said  she  is  now  one  of  the  few  inhabitants  of  one  of  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  Bering  Sea.  She 
will  return  to  Brooklyn  as  soon  as  the  Government  agents  arrive  on  their  Summer  tour.  Miss 
Perpall  was  a  student  at  Packer  Institute  in  Brooklyn  when  she  met  Dr.  Chichester,  who  then 
was  a  student  in  George  Washington  University.  He  received  his  degree  last  June,  and  was  then 
appointed  by  the  Government  as  Governor  [Agent]  of  one  of  the  Pribilof  Islands.  Rather  than  be 
separated  from  him,  Miss  Perpall  and  he  were  married  last  July  in  St.  Paul’s  Church,  New  York 
City,  and  the  couple  started  on  their  5,000  mile  trip.  With  them  was  a  scientist  named  Hahn.  A  few 
days  ago  a  dispatch  to  Washington  notified  the  Government  that  Hahn  had  been  killed  in  a  boat 
accident.  Yesterday  Mr.  Perpall  received  the  telegram  from  his  daughter. 

The  island  is  cut  off  from  communication  with  the  world  from  October  until  June,  so  no  definite 
news  of  the  accident  can  be  learned  until  the  arrival  of  the  first  mail  ship  about  the  middle  of  July.

Alaska,  1910-1913 

Agent,  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce,  Bureau  of  Fisheries,  St.  Paul  Island,  1914-1917 
Superintendent,  Pribilof  Islands,  1918-1939 

Genealogy 

Harry  John  Christoffers  was  the  only  son  of  railroad 
station  agent  Harry  G.  Christophers17  of  New  York 
City  and  Christina  (McVicar)  Christoffers.  Harry  J. 

Christoffers  married  Elsie  Tatiana  Kokrine  (1891  — 

1961)  in  1918  at  Tacoma,  Washington.  Elsie  was  born 
at  Kokrines,  Alaska,  to  Henry  Gregory  Kokrine,  a 
Finnish  fur  trader  of  the  Yukon  River  gold  rush  era, 
and  his  third  wife,  Tatiana  (Teyotaa)  Larion  Kokrine. 

Elsie’s  father  had  immigrated  to  Alaska  during  the 
Russian-American  era  and  chose  to  remain  after  the 
Alaska  Purchase.  Her  mother,  Teyotaa  Larion  Kokrine, 

“was  of  Athabascan,  probably  Koyukon  heritage.”18 
According  to  family  oral  tradition,  Teyotaa  Larion  was 
the  daughter  of  an  Alaskan  chief,  a  point  noted  in  a 
1946  news  column.19  Missionary  Robert  McDonald 
in  his  journal  of  July  14,  1872,  referred  to  Larion  as  a 
chief  of  the  “Koyookuk  Indians”  belonging  to  Fort  Nulatke,  near  Fort  St.  Michael,  on  the 
Yukon  River.20  Harry  J.  and  Elise  Christophers  had  one  son,  Harry  John  Christoffers  Jr. 
Harry  J.  Christophers  Sr.  died  at  Bellingham,  Washington,  September  8,  1939.21

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Harry  John  Christoffers  Jr.,  as  noted  in  various  Agents’  Log  entries,  spent  many  of  his 
early  years  in  the  Pribilof  Islands  with  his  parents.  Agent  Watson  Colt  Allis  (see  Allis’ 
biography)  paid  tribute  to  the  child  in  a  1938  interview  with  author  Barrett  Willoughby: 

The  taking  of  the  annual  seal  census  is  not  a  job  for  a  timid  person,  even  though  the  count 
is  facilitated  by  the  use  of  cameras.  The  rookeries  are  laid  off  in  sectors,  which  are  then 
photographed.  The  pictures  are  shot  from  exactly  the  same  angle  each  year,  to  assure  a 
true  comparison.  This  is  made  easy  by  marking  suitable  boulders  in  each  sector  with  white 
symbols,  on  which  the  camera  can  be  accurately  aligned.  On  the  bachelor  hauling  grounds, 
the  photographer  is  never  in  any  danger.  But  getting  down  into  the  sacred  harems  guarded 
by  warrior  bulls  is  a  feat  that  calls  for  steady  nerves,  sharp  eyes,  and  the  ability  to  leap  long 
distances  on  short  notice.  The  present  superintendent,  Harry  Christoffers,  prefers  to  do 
this  work  personally.  He  spends  hours  sitting  quietly  among  the  battling  bulls,  “getting 
acquainted”;  moving  only  with  the  utmost  deliberation.  To  guard  against  unexpected 
attacks  from  the  rear,  he  must  take  an  assistant  whose  nerves  are  as  steady  as  his  own. 

The  best  “man”  he  has  found  for  this  hazardous  job  of  lookout  is  his  own  small  son  who, 
accustomed  to  seals  from  infancy,  is  utterly  without  fear  of  the  beasts.22 

Harry  John  Christoffers  received  numerous  accolades  for  his  work  spanning  twenty- 
five  years  as  a  Pribilof  Islands  agent.  Two  examples: 

Mr.  Christoffers  was  born  at  London,  Dane  County,  Wisconsin,  on  August  13,  1888.  Within 
a  few  weeks  after  his  graduation  from  the  University  of  Wisconsin  in  1910,  he  entered 
the  Bureau  of  Fisheries  employ  as  scientific  assistant.  About  a  year  later  he  was  appointed 
warden  in  Alaska,  and  throughout  the  subsequent  28  years  of  his  service  was  identified 
with  the  Alaska  work. 

For  16  years  he  was  in  direct  charge  of  fur-seal  operations  centering  at  the  Pribilof  Islands, 
the  greatest  activity  of  this  kind  in  the  world.  Under  his  administration,  the  herd  more 
than  trebled  in  size,  increasing  from  about  650,000  to  over  2,000,000  animals,  and  at  the 
same  time  yielding  upward  of  700,000  skins.  Unquestionably,  he  was  a  leading  authority  on 
Alaska  fur  seals  and  established  a  wide  reputation  for  his  contribution  to  the  conservation 
of  a  great  wildlife  resource.

During  the  administration  of  Mr.  Christoffers  not  only  was  there  a  great  increase  in 
the  size  but  also  extraordinary  improvements  were  made  to  the  plant  and  equipment 
at  the  Pribilof  Islands,  such  as  the  erection  of  many  new  dwellings  and  other  important 
structures,  the  building  of  roads  and  wharves,  and,  in  fact,  almost  complete  rehabilitation 
of  the  establishment.  A  further  improvement  was  the  addition  of  the  seagoing  tender 
Penguin  for  the  transportation  of  supplies  and  personnel  between  Seattle  and  the  Islands. 

Mr.  Christoffers  made  trips  each  season  on  this  vessel  and  took  particular  interest  and 
pride  in  the  fine  performance  of  the  arduous  service  by  this  craft. ...  He  had  a  broad 
human  understanding  and  sympathy,  a  notable  example  of  which  was  his  interest  in  the 
more  than  400  native  inhabitants  of  the  Pribilof  Islands.  They  had  the  highest  regard  for 
him,  recognizing  that  always  he  was  eminently  fair  and  just  and  endeavored  constantly  to 
further  their  welfare.23 

In  a  1940  annual  report,  Christoffers  was  remembered: 

To  his  constructive  and  untiring  efforts,  more  than  to  those  of  any  other  single  person,  may 
be  attributed  the  excellent  results  achieved  in  the  management  of  the  fur-seal  industry  and 
the  improvements  in  housing  and  other  conditions  for  the  welfare  of  the  natives.24 

In  researching  Harry  John  Christoffers  Sr.,  the  authors  made  contact  with  his  grand¬ 
son,  Henry  J.  Christoffers,  PhD  in  mathematics  from  the  University  of  Chicago.  Dr. 
Christoffers  brought  forward  a  collection  of  16  mm  and  35  mm  movie  films,  presumably 
taken  by  his  grandfather  during  the  1930s.  NOAA  acquired  these  films  and  converted 
them  to  a  digital  format.  Many  depict  natural  history  subjects  at  the  Pribilofs,  and  to  a 
lesser  extent  scenes  of  human  activity.  In  2009,  NOAA  donated  the  original  films  to  the 
National  Archives  and  Records  Administration  in  College  Park,  Maryland.

Ezra  Westcote  Clark  II  became  a  Washington,  D.C.,  attorney.  He  worked  for  the 
U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury  from  May  3,  1871,  until  March  6,  1886.  His  first  direct 
acquaintance  with  the  Seal  Islands  occurred  during  his  duty  as  Chief  of  the  Revenue 
Marine  Bureau,  a  position  he  held  in  Washington,  D.C.,  from  1878  to  1885.  The  Board 
of  Geographical  Names  designated  the  Clark  River  in  Alaska  after  him  in  honor  of  his 
service,  which  led  to  discoveries  in  the  new  Territory  of  Alaska. 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Secretary  of  the  Treasury  William  Windom  opened  bids  on  February  21,  1890,  for  a  new 
twenty-year  commercial  harvest  lease  of  the  Seal  Islands.  Bid  no.  7,  one  of  twelve  bids, 
was  submitted  by  Ezra  Clark,  along  with  associates  Bateman,  Lemon,  and  others.  Despite 
the  Clark  investor  group’s  offer  “to  pay  a  bonus  of  $120,000  in  addition  to  the  rental  of 
$50,000.00  per  annum  and  the  tax  of  $2.00  per  skin,”29  they  lost  to  the  North  American 
Commercial  Company  of  New  York  and  San  Francisco,  as  described  in  a  New  York  Times 
article: 

[The  North  American  Commercial  Company  won]  . . .  exclusive  privilege  of  taking  fur  seals

1,  1890.  The  directors  of  the  company  are:  Lloyd  Tevis,  Henry  Cowell,  Matthias  Meyer,  and 
Isaac  Liebes,  all  of  San  Francisco,  and  Albert  Miller  of  Oakland,  Cal.,  D.O.  [Darious  Ogden] 

Mills  of  New  York  is  a  stockholder  of  the  company.  Its  capital  stock  is  $2,000,000.00. 

The  company  proposes  to  pay  an  annual  rental  of  $60,000.00  for  the  lease,  and,  in  addition 
to  the  revenue  tax  of  $2  upon  each  seal  skin,  it  will  pay  $7.62  Vi  for  each  fur-seal  skin  that 
shall  be  taken  and  shipped  by  it.  The  company  also  proposes  to  pay  50  cents  per  gallon 
for  each  gallon  of  seal  oil;  to  furnish,  free  of  charge  to  the  native  inhabitants  of  the  islands 
of  St.  Paul  and  St.  George,  annually,  such  quantity  of  dried  salmon  as  the  Secretary  of  the 
Treasury  may  direct;  to  furnish,  under  the  direction  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  the 
natives  the  salt  and  barrels  necessary  for  preserving  meat.  So  far  as  may  be  practicable 
and  consistent  with  the  interests  of  the  company,  it  will  encourage  the  dressing,  dyeing, 
and  marketing  of  sealskins  within  the  United  States,  and  operate  its  lease  in  the  interest  of 
American  citizens. 

The  annual  revenue  to  the  Government  under  this  lease,  on  the  basis  of  100,000  seals  per 
annum  will  be  about  $1,000,000  as  against  about  $300,000  under  the  present  lease  to  the 

Despite  or  because  of  this  turn  of  events, 
Clark  arrived  in  the  Pribilof  Islands  on  May 
10,  1898,  at  age  fifty-nine,  with  his  wife, 
Sylvia.  The  majority  of  his  thirteen-year  ser¬ 
vice  was  on  St.  George  Island;  he  worked  on 
St.  Paul  Island  only  during  the  years  1901- 
02  and  1905-06.  His  duties  “under  the  direc¬ 
tion  of  the  agent”  included  taking  charge  of 
matters  “pertaining  to  the  fur-seal  fisheries 
of  Alaska,  including  relations  with  lessees 
of  the  seal  islands  and  the  natives,  guarding 
the  seal  herds  and  custody  of  buildings  and 
Government  property.”31  The  Clarks  stayed 
throughout  some  years  on  St.  George  Island; 
other  years  they  returned  in  the  off  season  to  the  States.  During  his  tenure,  Ezra  Clark 
made  entries  in  the  Agent’s  Log  for  whichever  island  he  was  assigned  to.  His  wife  taught 
the  “junior  school  children”32  according  to  St.  George  Island  Agent’s  Log  entries. 

Ezra  Clark  presented  the  idea  of  bringing  reindeer  to  the  islands  to  Secretary  Metcalf 
of  the  Department  of  Commerce  and  Labor  in  a  letter  to  Washington,  D.C.,  dated  March 
24,  1905. 

Sir:  I  beg  the  attention  of  the  department  to  the  following  statement  and  recommendation: 

For  some  years  past  the  Government  has  been  engaged  in  establishing  a  herd  of  reindeer  in 
northern  Alaska.  The  object  has  been  accomplished  by  importing  the  original  stock  from 
Siberia  and  augmenting  it  by  propagation  at  the  several  Alaska  stations.  The  herd  now 
numbers  over  8,000,  distributed  at  ten  or  a  dozen  stations.  The  purpose  of  the  undertaking 
is  to  furnish  a  means  of  subsistence  for  the  simple  natives  of  our  most  northern  coasts  in 
place  of  the  wild  game  which  is  being  driven  out  by  the  encroachment  of  civilization. 

The  reindeer  afford  to  the  northern  natives  food  and  clothing,  and  furnish  beasts  of  burden 
to  transport  the  people  and  their  supplies  over  the  frozen  tundra.  The  female  deer  yield  a 
very  rich  milk.  Introducing  the  reindeer  is  a  beneficent  work.

The  object  of  this  communication  is  to  recommend  that  this  department  take  steps  to  have 
a  small  band  of  reindeer  transferred  to  each  of  the  seal  islands,  with  the  purpose  of  creating 
a  herd  as  a  source  of  subsistence  of  the  native  residents  of  those  islands.  In  view  of  the 
steady  diminution  of  the  seal  herd,  some  provision  is  likely  to  become  necessary  in  the  not 
distant  future.  In  any  event,  the  enterprise  would  be  a  good  one  from  an  economical  point 
of  view.  The  reindeer  would  increase  rapidly,  without  cost  for  food  or  superintendence.  The 
presence  of  Government  agents  the  year  round  would  insure  the  necessary  oversight. 

The  mosses  and  grasses  of  the  seal  islands,  of  which  there  is  a  great  abundance,  are  of  the 
precise  character  required  by  these  animals.  There  is  no  question  of  the  adaptability  of  the 
islands  to  the  raising  of  reindeer.  Examination  by  experts  from  the  north  shows  them  to  be 
especially  fitted  for  the  purpose.  The  animals  are  tractable  and  gentle,  and  no  disturbance 
of  other  animals  on  the  island  need  be  apprehended  from  their  presence.  The  seals  are 
not  disturbed  by  horses,  cattle,  or  sheep,  which  have  run  loose  on  the  islands  from  time 
immemorial. 

The  Bureau  of  Education,  under  the  Interior  Department,  had  charge  of  the  reindeer 
business  in  Alaska,  and  Dr.  Sheldon  Jackson,  of  the  said  bureau,  the  general  agent  of 
education  for  Alaska,  has  immediate  charge  of  it.  The  writer  has  conferred  with  this 
gentleman  on  the  subject,  who  sees  no  obstacle  to  the  plan  here  recommended.  The 
revenue  cutters  have  always  transported  the  reindeer  from  Siberia,  and  may  be  availed  of  to 
bring  down  from  northern  Alaska  the  few  required  to  form  the  nucleus  of  a  herd  for  each 
seal  island. 

I  therefore  respectfully  recommend  that  a  letter  be  addressed  to  the  honorable  the 
Secretary  of  the  Interior,  requesting  that  a  small  herd  of  reindeer,  preferable  50  to  75 
females,  with  the  necessary  proportion  of  males,  be  transferred  from  the  Government  herd 
in  Alaska  to  the  seal  islands  of  the  Pribilof  group,  an  equal  number  to  each  of  the  islands  of 
St.  Paul  and  St.  George. 

It  is  understood  that  no  expense  will  be  involved  in  this  measure,  as  the  revenue  cutter 
would  render  this  service  while  in  the  performance  of  her  regular  cruising,  and  the  reindeer 
are  now  owned  by  the  Government. 

Very  respectfully, 

Ezra  W.  Clark 

Assistant  Agent  Alaskan  Fur-Seal  Service33 

The  Department  apparently  accepted  Clark’s  concept,  as  on  August  31,  1911,  twenty- 
five  reindeer— twenty-one  cows  (does)  and  four  bulls— were  introduced  on  St.  Paul  Island 
and  the  next  day  twelve  cows  and  three  bulls  were  delivered  to  St.  George.34  The  herds 
multiplied  on  each  island,  but  poaching  during  and  after  WWII  and  in  particular  harsh 
weather  brought  the  Pribilof  herds  to  extinction  by  1950.35  However,  reindeer  were  suc¬ 
cessfully  reintroduced  to  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  islands  in  1951  and  1980,  respectively. 

An  article  appeared  in  the  Washington  Star  describing  the  Clarks’  life  in  the  Pribilof 
Islands,  probably  based  on  a  letter  from  Sylvia  Clark  to  a  family  member  in  Washington, 
D.C.: 

At  age  73,  Ezra  Clark’s  tenure  in  the  Seal  Islands  concluded,  two  years  after  termina¬ 
tion  of  the  North  American  Commercial  Company  lease  in  1910.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


She’s  from  Washington  and  Lives  Up  On  a  Seal  Island 

St.  Paul  and  St.  George  are  the  homes  of  nearly  all  the  seals  remaining  in  existence  and  they 
are  about  1,800  miles  west  of  the  entrance  to  Puget  Sound  and  about  200  northwest  of  the 
Aleutian  Islands,  beginning  at  Unimak  Pass.  St.  George,  which  is  the  smaller  of  the  two,  being 
about  six  by  twelve  miles  in  extent,  is  forty  miles  from  St.  Paul,  and  it  has  a  population  of  about 
100  Aleuts,  and  four  or  five  whites,  consisting  of  Maj.  Clark  and  his  wife,  a  physician,  and  two 
or  three  clerks  of  the  North  American  Commercial  Co.,  which  controls  the  seal  business,  and 
has  stores  and  warehouses  on  both  islands.  The  little  village  of  St.  George  consists  of  twenty- 
five  or  thirty  houses,  including  the  company’s  buildings,  the  agent’s  house  and  a  Greek  church. 
There  are  no  other  houses  on  the  islands,  and  Mrs.  Clark  is  the  only  white  woman.  Her  home  is 
a  small  cottage  of  small  rooms,  very  cozy  and  comfortable,  with  books  and  pictures  and  a  fine 
outlook  over  the  sea.  She  does  no  cooking  in  her  own  house,  as  the  company  officials  take  their 
meals  at  the  company  house  near  by.  Mrs.  Clark’s  nearest  neighbor  is  the  wife  of  the  agent  on 
St.  Paul,  who  is  less  lonely  because  she  has  with  her  two  small  children,  Mrs.  Clark’s  children 
being  grown  and  having  their  own  homes  in  the  states.  There  is  no  communication  between 
the  islands  except  by  one  of  the  company’s  ships  and  by  revenue  cutters,  as  other  ships  are  not 
permitted  to  visit  the  islands.  These  ships  come  only  in  the  summer,  and  from  October  until 
June  Mrs.  Clark  does  not  expect  to  see  any  one  or  hear  anything  from  the  United  States,  or  to 
send  word  home,  no  matter  what  happens.  Sickness,  death,  disaster  may  come  to  her  far  off  in 
that  forbidding  sea  or  may  visit  her  own  at  home,  but  no  word  may  come  or  go  until  navigation 
is  resumed.  St.  George  is  absolutely  without  trees,  but  its  rolling  surface  and  mountains,  1,000 
feet  high,  are  beautifully  green  with  coarse  grass  and  moss,  wild  flowers  of  brilliant  hues  dot  the 
level  stretches  near  the  sea.  Blue  foxes  abound,  and  over  the  rocks  at  the  water’s  edge  thousands 
and  thousands  of  seals  in  ceaseless  activity  disport  themselves  noisily  day  and  night  from  June 
until  December,  while  millions  of  water  fowl  fill  the  air  and  the  sea  and  flutter  about  the  cliffs. 
Three  hundred  days  in  the  year  the  weather  is  dark  and  dismal,  and  fogs  hide  the  islands  for 
days  at  a  time.  The  cold  is  never  excessive,  but  the  winter  storms  are  severe,  and  terrific  gales 
sweep  over  sea  and  land.  Tnere  is  no  harbor,  and  ships  come  to  anchor  a  mile  or  more  from 
shore.36

with  other  special  investigations  of  the  seal  herds  for  the  Bureau  of  Fisheries  in  1909  and 
1912-1913. 

James  Macoun,  a  scientist  representing  the  Canadian  government  on  the  commis¬ 
sion,  cited  an  incident  involving  George  Clark  that  recounts  a  challenge  facing  scientists, 
then  and  now,  studying  the  Pribilof  Island  fur-seal  herds  during  their  breeding  period: 

on  one  occasion  last  year  when  we  were  counting  pups  a  bull  chased  Mr.  Clarke  [sic],  Dr. 

Jordans  assistant,  and  his  retreat  being  cut  off  he  jumped  from  a  low  cliff  into  the  sea  rather 
then  attempt  to  defend  himself  against  the  enraged  bull.38 

St.  Paul  Island  Agent  Joseph  Crowley  commented  on  George  Clark’s  dedication  and 
tenacity  during  the  1896-1897  fur-seal  investigations: 

June  24  [1897]  Thursday 

Mr.  Clark,  Secretary  to  Dr.  Jordan,  on  behalf  of  the  American  Commission  on  the  Seal 
question,  is  the  busiest  man  on  the  Island,  and  certainly  one  of  the  closest  of  observers. 

There  is  no  doubt  of  his  knowing  the  day  of  landing  of  all  the  mother  seals  at  present  on  the 
rookeries  within  an  hours  walk  of  the  village;  the  birthday  of  every  pup  seal  up  to  date,  on 
the  same  rookeries,  and  the  cause  of  the  death  of  all  of  them  that  have  died  thus  far!  Late  at 
night,  and  early  in  the  morning  and,  all  day,  he  is  out  on  some  rookery  observing  seal  life, 
nor  does  he  ever  complain  of  being  tired,  although  he  walks  so  much  over  the  roughest  of 
rough  ground  for  many  miles  daily.39 

During  1912  and  1913,  Professor  George  Clark  of  Stanford  University  revisited  the 
Pribilof  Islands,  with  support  from  the  U.S.  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey,  to  map  the  seal 
rookeries.  Several  days  before  Clark’s  arrival  on  St.  Paul  Island  in  1913,  he  sent  a  telegram 
to  St.  Paul  Island  Agent  Walter  Lembkey  concerning  a  trip  to  the  islands  by  Henry  Wood 
Elliott  and  his  stenographer,  A.  J.  Gallagher: 

Commissioner  directs  avoiding  friction  and  facilitating  their  work  which  is  to  be  shared 
in  by  Chamberlain  and  myself  [Clark]  or  two  Department  representatives.  Full  Records  to 
be  kept  and  signed  in  duplicate.  Hope  operations  can  await  our  arrival.  Inform  [Assistant 
Agent]  Proctor  [on  St.  George  Island].40 

Renowned  fur-seal  naturalist  and  conservationist  Henry  Wood  Elliott  had  been 
sent  by  Chairman  Rothermel  of  the  Congressional  Committee  of  Expenditures  in  the 
Department  of  Commerce  to  conduct  an  independent  investigation  of  the  fur-seal  herd. 
He  and  Gallagher  had  arrived  on  July  9,  1913,  aboard  the  Tahoma .41  Agent  Lembkey  ap¬ 
parently  was  unaware  of  the  particulars  of  Elliott’s  mission,  as  attested  by  Lembkey ’s 
entry  into  the  Agent’s  Log: 

Elliott,  whose  connection  with  the  much-vexed  “seal  question,”  is  well  known,  comes  under 
some  sort  of  authority  derived  so  far  as  I  can  gather  from  the  Congressional  Committee  of 
Expenditures  in  the  Department  of  Commerce  to  investigate  seal  life.  Mr.  Gallagher,  a  most 
pleasant  gentleman,  is  a  reporter  for  the  Congressional  committee  and  seems  to  be  here  for 
the  purpose  of  taking  notes  as  dictated  by  Mr.  Elliott.42 

The  day  before  Professor  Clark’s  arrival,  Lembkey  received  instructions  from  Bureau 
of  Fisheries  Commissioner  Hugh  B.  Smith  that  clarified  Clark’s  telegram:  they  were  to 
conduct  a  corroborating  investigation  alongside  that  of  Elliott  and  Gallagher.  At  that 
point  Elliott  and  Gallagher  had  been  in  the  field  for  several  days.  Agent  Lembkey  found 
Elliott  and  Gallagher  at  the  Lagoon  Rookery  (which  no  longer  exists),  where  he  informed 


193 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


them  of  his  instructions.  Elliott  at  that  point  made  known  his  feelings  about  Lembkey’s 
instructions  as  well  as  his  feelings  toward  Clark,  as  recorded  by  Agent  Lembkey: 

I  informed  Mr.  Elliott  courteously  of  my  instructions  from  the  Commissioner  and 
stated  that  I  was  there  in  pursuance  of  those  instructions,  with  the  idea  of  sharing  in 
any  investigation  they  may  make  until  the  arrival  of  Mr.  Chamberlain  [see  Frederick 
Chamberlain  biography]  and  Mr.  Clark  which  I  expected  would  be  tomorrow.  Mr.  Elliott 
immediately  went  off  into  what  might  be  described  only  as  a  tantrum.  He  stated  that  he 
was  here  as  the  representative  of  a  Committee  of  Congress  to  make  an  entirely  independent 
investigation:  that  if  Mr.  Clark  wished  to  come  along  he  could  do  so;  or  he  could  go  to  hell, 
just  as  he  pleased.  That  he  had  a  personal  antipathy  to  Clark  because  the  latter  had  been 
writing  vituperative  letters  about  him  for  two  years  and  that  Clark  was  an  ignorant  person 
and  could  not  be  allowed  to  check  up  Elliott’s  work.  I  was  forced  to  reply  to  Mr.  Elliott  that 
I  would  be  obliged  to  carry  out  the  instructions  of  my  superior  officer,  and  that  if  Mr.  Clark 
was  not  here  I  would  accompany  him,  furthermore  that  in  accompanying  him  I  would 
not  go  to  hell.  Elliott  stated  that  he  had  not  intended  to  make  any  reference  to  me  . . .  that 
he  meant  Mr.  Clark  wholly;  I  told  him  that  Mr.  Clark  was  an  associate  of  mine  and  that  I 
objected  strongly  to  the  use  of  such  a  term  in  connection  with  him.  He  persisted  in  talking 
of  interference  with  his  work  and  continued  in  an  irrational  and  passionate  manner,  in 
spite  of  my  repeated  assurance  that  the  whole  object  of  the  instructions  was  to  have  made 
a  careful  and  impersonal  investigation  by  both  parties,  as  the  result  of  which  an  agreed 
statement  of  facts  would  be  prepared  to  and  signed  by  both  sides.  He  told  me  he  would  not 
submit  to  any  joint  investigation  . . .  and  that  he  would  not  enter  into  any  joint  work  with 
Clark  or  anyone.43 

The  Agent’s  Log  thereafter  offered  no  comment  on  relations  between  Clark  and 
Elliott,  except  that  Clark  went  to  meet  Elliott  at  Northeast  Point  the  evening  of  July  14, 
and  returned  without  Elliott  the  following  afternoon.  Elliott  and  Gallagher  proceeded 
to  St.  George  Island  on  July  17  without  Clark.  Following  their  return  to  St.  Paul  Island 
on  July  19,  only  one  other  encounter  between  Elliott  and  Clark  was  noted  in  the  Agent’s 
Log.  Although  of  little  significance,  it  sustained  the  lack  of  respect  Elliott  held  for  Clark.44 
Clark,  Elliott,  Gallagher,  and  Lembkey  departed  St.  Paul  Island  on  July  30,  with  Clark 
debarking  at  St.  George  Island  to  continue  his  assignment,  which  included  drafting  topo¬ 
graphical  maps  of  the  rookeries  and  seal  harems  on  both  islands.  Clark’s  highly  accurate 
maps  were  not  recognized  as  such  until  biologists  Wilfred  H.  Osgood,  Edward  A.  Preble, 
and  George  H.  Parker  published  them  as  part  of  their  1914  investigations.45

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Harry  Clark  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  May  16,  1892,  before  Notary 
Public  R.  Hilderbrandt  in  the  County  of  Tehama,  California: 

I  am  32  years  old,  a  native  of  Vermont,  and  now  a  resident  of  Vina,  Tehama  County  Cal., 
and  by  occupation  foreman  of  vineyard  cultivation  at  Governor  Stanford’s  Vina  Ranch. 

From  1884  to  1889,  inclusive,  I  was  in  the  employ  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  of 
San  Francisco,  on  St.  George  Island,  Alaska,  engaged  through  each  sealing  season  as  boss 
of  a  gang  of  seal  hunters  and  in  the  winter,  excepting  that  of  1886  and  1887,  as  teacher  and 
storekeeper  on  that  island. 

My  work  as  the  leader  of  the  "sealing  gang”  gave  me  as  perfect  opportunity  as  could  be  had 
for  studying  the  habits  and  peculiarities  of  the  seal  and  determining  the  best  manner  of 
caring  for  them. 

I  was  reared  on  a  farm,  and  have  been  familiar  from  boyhood  with  the  breeding  of 
domestic  animals,  and  particularly  with  the  rearing  and  management  of  young  animals; 
hence  a  comparison  of  the  young  seals  with  the  young  of  our  common  domestic  species  is 
most  natural.  From  my  experience  with  both  I  am  able  to  declare  positively  that  it  is  easier 
to  manage  and  handle  young  seals  than  calves  or  lambs.46

birds  as  a  youth  led  him  away  from  his  medical  career 
into  the  field  of  ornithology,  which  became  his  life’s 
work.

Coues’  assignments  in  the  army  took  him  to  various  outposts  in  the  West  at  a  time  when  it 
was  as  yet  little  affected  by  civilization.  He  was  stationed  at  Fort  Whipple,  Arizona,  in  1864; 
at  Fort  Macon,  North  Carolina,  in  1869-70;  at  Fort  Randall,  Dakota,  in  1873;  and  he  was 
appointed  naturalist  and  secretary  of  the  United  States  Northern  Boundary  Commission, 
1873-76.  Wherever  he  was  located  he  made  collections,  discovering  a  number  of  hitherto 
unknown  bird  species  and  securing  a  vast  amount  of  information  for  later  publications. 
Realizing  that  the  exploration  of  the  West  had  so  increased  the  knowledge  of  its

ornithology  as  to  render  all  general  works  on  the  subject  out  of  date,  he  conceived  and 
published,  in  1872,  his  famous  Key  to  North  American  Birds.™ 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Elliott  Coues’  Ornithology  of  the  Prybilov  Islands  (1875)  represented  the  first  written 
scientific  study  of  birds  at  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  islands.  He  identified  the  specimens 
provided  by  Henry  Wood  Elliott  and  relied  on  Elliott’s  1872-73  field  notes  to  write  his 
important  study.49 

In  1875,  J.  E.  Harting  of  Great  Britain  published  The  Fauna  of  the  Prybilov  Islands, 
which  included  excerpts  of  Coues’  Ornithology  of  the  Prybilov  Islands  as  well  as  some 
material  about  mammals  found  in  Report  on  the  Prybilov  Group  or  Seal  Islands  of  Alaska 
by  Henry  Wood  Elliott  (1873).  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  Richardson  had  pulled  Henry 
Elliott’s  report  because  he  found  some  of  the  naturalist’s  denigrating  comments  about 
both  the  government  and  the  Alaska  Natives  too  offensive  for  publication.  Henry  Elliott 
revised  the  offensive  material  and  the  document  was  published  under  different  titles  in

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Joseph  B.  Crowley  was  appointed  by  President  Grover  Cleveland  as  special  Treasury  agent 
to  the  Seal  Islands  in  1893,  and  he  continued  in  that  position  until  the  end  of  the  1897 
sealing  season.  The  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  issued  Crowley  the  following  instructions: 

Instructions  to  Treasury  Agent,  Seal  Island 

Treasury  Department 

Office  of  Secretary 

Washington,  D.C.  April  26,  1893 

Mr.  Joseph  B.  Crowley, 

Special  Agent  in  charge  of  Seal  islands, 

Washington,  D.C. 

Sir: 

Having  been  appointed  Treasury  Agent  in  charge  of  the  Seal  Islands  in  Alaska  you  are 
directed  to  proceed  to  San  Francisco,  California,  so  as  to  arrive  there  as  early  as  the  10th 
proximate,  and  to  take  passage  on  the  first  available  conveyance  to  the  islands.  Special 
Agents  Hall,  Adams,  and  Murray  will  accompany  you,  one  of  whom  you  will  assign  to 
duty  in  charge  of  St.  George  Island  to  relieve  Special  Agent  Lavender,  who  will  return  to 
his  home  by  the  first  vessel  leaving  the  islands.  One  of  these  Agents  will  relieve  Lieutenant 
Ainsworth  of  the  Revenue  Marine  Service,  who  was  temporarily  detailed  for  duty  on  the 
island  of  St.  Paul. 

Upon  arrival  at  the  islands  you  will  at  once  assume  charge  of  the  interests  and  property 
of  the  Government  and  see  to  it  that  your  authority  as  the  chief  representative  of  the 
Government  there  is  properly  respected.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Enclosed  herewith  you  will  find  a  copy  of  the  contract  between  the  U.S.  and  the  North 
American  Commercial  Co.  and  it  will  be  your  duty  to  see  that  its  provisions  are  enforced 
and  that  the  rights  of  the  Government  and  those  of  the  Lessees  there- under  are  duly 
protected. 

Copy  of  the  Modus  Vivendi  between  the  U.S.  and  Great  Britain  is  also  enclosed  for  your 
information,  which  you  will  observe  continues  in  force  pending  the  arbitration  of  the 
Bering  Sea  Question,  unless  otherwise  provided  for  after  Oct.  31st  1893. 

In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Modus  Vivendi  the  number  of  seals  to  be  taken 
during  the  season  of  1893  will  be  limited  to  7,500.  In  taking  this  number  you  will  permit  no 
seals  to  be  killed  except  those  yielding  good  marketable  skins.  The  killing  of  pup  seals  for 
food  for  the  natives  or  any  purpose  will  not  be  permitted. 

The  killing  season  will  begin  as  soon  after  your  arrival  as  in  your  judgment  the  rookeries 
are  in  proper  condition  for  driving,  and  the  time  for  taking  seals  is  left  to  your  discretion, 
with  the  exception  that  no  seals  are  to  be  taken  during  the  stagy  period,  which  is 
understood  to  be  the  period  between  the  10th  of  Aug.  and  the  30th  of  Sept. 

It  is  believed  that  the  killing  should  be  confined  between  the  1st  of  June  and  the  10th  of 
Aug.  a  better  quality  of  skins  would  be  obtained  and  less  injury  be  done  to  the  rookeries. 
This  matter  is,  however,  left  as  above  stated,  to  your  discretion,  and  in  reference  hereto  you 
will  confer  fully  with  the  representative  of  the  company;  its  interests  and  those  of  the  Govt, 
in  the  preservation  of  the  Fur  Seal  Industry  being  identical.  You  will  endeavor  to  cultivate 
and  promote  harmonious  relations  with  the  Agents  of  the  Company  with  respect  to  affairs 
on  the  islands,  taking  care  at  all  times  that  the  provisions  of  the  law  and  of  the  contract  are 
faithfully  observed. 

Should  any  disagreement  arise  between  you  and  the  Company’s  Superintendent  with 
respect  to  the  construction  of  the  law  on  the  contract  between  the  Government  and  said 
Company,  or  upon  any  matter  of  administration  on  the  islands,  your  decision  must  govern 
for  the  time  being,  but  in  all  such  cases  you  will  require  the  Superintendent  to  furnish  you 
a  statement  in  writing  of  his  news  upon  the  question  involved,  which  you  will  submit  to  the 
Department  with  your  annual  report. 

The  Department  desires  you  to  make  a  thorough  examination  during  the  sealing  season 
as  to  the  habits,  numbers  and  condition  of  the  seals  and  seal  rookeries,  the  results  of  such 
observations  to  be  embodied  in  your  annual  report. 

The  care  and  welfare  of  the  natives  will  receive  your  careful  attention  and  you  will  see  that 
the  Lessees  shall  perform  all  the  obligations  of  their  contract  towards  these  people.  You 
will  ascertain  the  prices  charged  at  the  Company’s  stores  and  compare  them  with  prices  at 
San  Francisco  and  will  report  any  instances  where  the  natives  are  compelled  to  pay  more 
than  a  fair  price  for  articles  sold  them,  and  you  will  also  inspect  the  articles  sold  them,  and 
you  will  also  inspect  the  articles  supplied  as  to  quality  and  quantity,  and  if  deficient  you 
will  report  the  fact  to  the  Department.  The  compensation  to  be  paid  by  the  Company  to 
the  natives  for  killing,  salting,  and  loading  the  seal  skins  on  board  the  Company’s  steamer 
will  be  fifty  cents  for  each  skin  taken  from  the  islands  during  the  season.  The  money  thus 
earned  constitutes  a  community  fund,  and  is  to  be  divided  among  the  natives  according  to 
their  respective  classification.  This  division  may  be  made  by  the  Company  subject  to  your 
approval  and  you  will  transmit  with  your  report  a  schedule  showing  the  apportionment 
with  the  name  of  each  person  sharing  therein. 

Under  previous  instructions  from  this  Department:  A  system  was  adopted  by  which 
orders  are  made  upon  the  Company  for  supplies  necessary  for  the  support  of  the  native 
inhabitants.  This  system  will  be  continued  by  you.  An  appropriation  of  $19,500  was  made 
by  Congress  for  the  current  fiscal  year  for  the  support  of  the  natives,  and  the  same  amount 
has  been  appropriated  for  the  coming  fiscal  year.  Careful  accounts  will  be  kept  both  upon 
the  islands  of  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  of  the  articles  thus  furnished  in  order  that  you  may 
be  able  to  certify  the  bills  of  the  Company  therefore.  The  supplies  to  be  furnished  will  be

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


confined  to  the  substantial  means  of  subsistence.  The  funds  appropriated  will  probably  fall 
short  of  the  amount  needed  for  necessaries,  and  the  natives  should  not  be  permitted  to  buy 
at  the  Company’s  stores  expensive  luxuries.  You  will  endeavor  to  secure  the  co-operation  of 
the  Agents  of  the  Company  in  enforcing  economy  in  these  expenditures. 

The  Department  has  arranged  with  the  North  American  Commercial  Company  to  deliver 
to  the  islands  two  hundred  ninety  (290)  tons  of  coal  in  addition  to  the  eighty  (80)  tons 
which  they  are  required  to  furnish  under  the  terms  of  the  lease.  This  will  be  a  supply  of  St. 
Paul  and  St.  George  for  the  ensuing  fiscal  year. 

You  will  take  account  of  the  coal  to  be  furnished  by  the  Company  and  cause  it  to  be  divided 
as  follows,  unless  in  your  judgment  a  different  division  should  be  made  in  the  interest  of 
the  natives: 

On  St.  Paul  Island 

For  the  Government  House — 10  tons 
For  use  of  the  natives — 240  tons 

On  St.  George  Island 
For  the  Government  House — 10  tons 
For  the  use  of  the  natives — 110  tons 
Total=370  tons 

The  schools  upon  each  of  the  islands  of  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  are  to  be  maintained  from 
Sept.  1st  to  May  1st,  and  are  to  be  open  five  days  in  the  week.  It  will  be  your  duty  and  that 
of  the  Agents  who  may  be  assigned  to  the  islands  during  the  winter  to  see  that  the  teachers 
appointed  by  the  Company  are  competent  to  teach  the  English  language,  and  that  they 
faithfully  perform  this  duty. 

The  North  American  Commercial  Company  under  its  lease  has  the  exclusive  privilege  to 
trade  in  seal  skins  on  the  islands  of  St.  Paul  and  St.  George,  and  you  will  see  that  no  other 
persons  are  allowed  to  trade  with  the  natives  for  peltries  of  any  kind. 

It  is  understood  that  the  number  of  blue  foxes  on  the  islands  has  greatly  decreased.  For  the 
benefit  of  the  natives,  to  whom  fox  skins  hair  has  heretofore  been  a  source  of  considerable 
income,  you  will  take  such  measures  in  co-operation  with  the  Agents  of  the  lessees  as  in 
your  judgment  may  be  deemed  best  to  restrain  the  wholesale  killing  of  foxes  during  the 
winter.  It  is  believed  that  if  the  foxes  could  be  trapped  in  such  a  way  as  to  prevent  his  injury 
and  all  females  so  caught  turned  loose,  such  a  course  would  tend  to  increase  the  supply  of 
these  valuable  animals  and  you  are  authorized  to  take  such  measures  as  may  seem  best  to 
promote  this  end.  The  lessees  have  the  exclusive  privilege  of  purchasing  these  skins  from 
the  natives  and  you  will  inform  yourself  as  to  their  value,  and  will  fix  a  fair  price  for  them  to 
be  paid  by  the  Company  to  the  natives. 

Visitors  who  may  come  upon  the  islands  will  not  be  permitted  to  trade  with  the  natives  and 
no  unauthorized  person  will  be  allowed  to  land  upon  the  islands.  (Under  no  circumstances 
will  visitors  be  allowed  to  go  upon  the  rookeries  as  it  is  understood  that  miscellaneous 

visiting  by  unauthorized  persons  is  injurious  to  the  Seal  herd.) 

You  will  be  personally  present  upon  the  grounds  during  the  killing  season,  and  support  the 
officers  of  the  company  in  securing  faithful  work  by  the  natives. 

You  will  endeavor  to  secure  the  good  will  and  confidence  of  the  native  inhabitants  and 
advise  them  of  their  rights  as  American  citizens,  and  by  proper  means  endeavor  to  increase 
their  friendship  to  the  Government  and  people  of  the  U.  S. 

You  will  give  careful  attention  to  the  sanitary  condition  of  the  villages  and  houses  of  the 
people,  and  will  require  the  Company  to  make  such  repairs  to  the  dwellings  as  are  needed 
from  time  to  time  to  make  them  comfortable. 

It  is  not  intended  that  the  appropriation  of  Congress  for  the  care  of  these  people  shall  be 
disbursed  to  them  entirely  as  a  gratuity,  but  they  will  be  expected  as  an  equivalent  therefore 


200

to  perform  such  services  as  you  may  elect  such  as  guarding  the  rookeries,  making  roads, 
repairing  dwellings,  unloading  and  delivering  coal  for  their  use,  and  carrying  in  effect  such 
other  measures  as  you  may  deem  advisable  for  the  improvement  of  the  sanitary  condition 
of  the  villages  and  general  health  of  the  natives.  The  work  thus  performed,  however,  must 
not  be  regarded  as  relieving  the  Company  from  their  obligation  under  the  lease  to  employ 
the  natives  for  such  work  upon  the  islands  as  they  are  fit  to  perform  at  a  fair  and  just 
compensation,  and  to  contribute  all  reasonable  efforts  to  secure  the  friendship,  health, 
education,  and  promote  the  morals  and  civilization  of  such  native  inhabitants. 

It  is  understood  that  many  of  the  natives  use  sugar  to  make  quass,  and  then  indulge  in 
drunkenness  and  disorderly  conduct.  As  the  chief  representative  of  the  U.S.  on  the  islands 
it  will  be  your  duty  to  correct  these  evils  and  punish  offenders  against  good  order  and 
good  morals  on  the  islands.  The  mode  of  accomplishing  this  must  be  left  to  your  sound 
judgment,  but  such  measures  as  may  be  adopted  must  be  of  a  mild  correction  character, 
and  must  in  no  case  be  harsh  or  oppressive. 

When  it  is  established  that  a  man  or  woman  has  made  quass  from  the  sugar  supplied  them 
the  further  issue  of  sugar  to  such  persons  should  be  restricted  or  entirely  cut  off;  but  care 
should  be  taken  to  avoid  punishing  the  innocent  members  of  a  family  by  such  deprivation 
on  account  of  the  misuse  of  sugar  by  one  of  their  number. 

A  copy  of  these  instructions  will  be  furnished  by  you  to  the  Agent  to  be  placed  in  charge  of 
St.  George  Island,  and  to  the  Agt.  who  may  be  at  any  time  placed  in  temporary  charge  of 
St.  Paul  Island,  for  their  guidance.  You  will  make  such  assignment  of  the  Assistant  Agents 
as  you  may  deem  best,  but  neither  the  island  of  St.  George  nor  St.  Paul  must  be  left  at  any 
time  without  the  presence  of  a  Special  Agent. 

Respectfully  yours, 

C.  A.  Hamlin, 

Acting  Secretary 
A.K.F.55 

It  appears  an  unlikely  coincidence  that  the  Treasury  Department  appointed  Joseph 
Crowley  as  agent  at  this  juncture  of  the  Seal  Islands  history.  Crowley  was  an  appointed 
judge  from  Crawford  County,  Illinois,  and  if  ever  the  islands  needed  an  agent  familiar 
with  upholding  the  law,  this  was  the  time.  The  Bering  Sea  controversy  over  the  rights  to 
the  seal  fishery  was  in  arbitration  before  an  international  tribunal  at  Paris,  France.  The 
Treasury  Department  needed  an  exceptional  man  to  assist  them  in  the  field. 

U.S.  Treasury  Agent-in-Charge  Joseph  Crowley  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  aboard  the 
North  American  Commercial  Company  steamer  Farallon  on  June  3,  1893.  He  replaced 
acting  Agent-in-Charge  Lt.  D.  J.  Ainsworth,  Revenue  Marine.56  Crowley  stayed  on  St. 
Paul  Island  during  the  sealing  seasons  of  his  tenure,  while  the  assistant  special  agents 
covered  for  him  throughout  the  calendar  year. 

Numerous  examples  as  gleaned  from  the  Agent's  Log  depict  Agent  Crowley  set¬ 
ting  about  his  business  in  accordance  with  his  instructions  from  Acting  Secretary  of  the 
Treasury  Hamlin.  Interested  students  are  encouraged  to  delve  into  the  historical  record 
for  more  information  and  to  allow  individual  interpretation  as  to  the  significance  of 
Crowley’s  influence  in  the  short  or  long  term.  Some  examples  are  provided  here. 

Special  Assistant  Agent  Thomas  E.  Adams  (see  Adams’  biography)  worked  with  the 
community  to  form  the  first  St.  Paul  Island  Council,  which  led  to  the  adoption  of  Native 
community  rules.  Crowley  applied  his  legal  expertise  to  settle  a  question  raised  by  the 


201 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


council  regarding  use  of  the  Pribilof  Island  church  funds  to  support  other  than  Pribilof 
Island  community  needs.  Other  actions  of  Crowley’s  were  recorded  by  the  agent: 

Wednesday  lune  21st  1893 

32  native  men  call  on  Treasury  Agent  Crowley  at  Government  House,  and  request  the 
removal  of  Chief,  Nicoli  Krukoff  for  cause  and  after  hearing  charges  the  matter  of  removal 
of  the  chief  was  deferred,  time  indefinite  and  the  natives  go  away  satisfied.5 

Friday  lune  23rd  1893 

The  labor  of  unloading  coal  [circa  125  tons]  from  steamer  [Farallon]  still  in  progress. . . . 

Lee,  the  companies  [sic]  Chinese  Laundry  man  called  [and]  filed  complain  [sic]  against  Paul 
Koshievnikoff  a  small  native  boy  for  throwing  and  striking  him  in  the  face  with  a  stone.  The 
boy  was  sent  for  and  came  to  Government  house  accompanied  by  his  mother  who  after 
facts  gave  her  young  son  a  good  strapping  and  accompanied  him  home.58 

Friday  lune  28,  1893 

Assistant  Agent  [Joseph]  Murray,  in  pursuance  of  instructions  from  Chief  Agent  Crowley 
ordered  the  following  [four  of  eight  orders;  the  other  four  were  specific  to  individual 
families]:59 

1.  No  native  having  money  on  deposit  with  the  N.A.C.  Company  on  account  of  inheritance, 
shall  be  permitted  to  withdraw  the  deposit,  or  any  portion  thereof,  or  to  contract 
indebtedness  to  the  Company  to  be  paid  therefrom,  unless  upon  written  order  of  the 
Government  Agent  in  charge. 

2.  No  native  having  credit  on  account  of  the  division  of  earnings  in  taking  and  handling  seal 
pelts,  or  for  fox  skins  sold  to  the  N.A.C.  Company,  shall  be  paid  money  by  the  Company  on 
account  of  such  credits  except  as  specified  by  the  Government  Agent  in  charge,  in  writing. 

7.  That  the  compensation  to  natives,  when  employed  by  the  Government,  shall  hereafter  be 
$1.50  per  day,  and,  by  the  hours,  15  cents,  instead  of  10  cents,  as  heretofore  these  being  the 
rates  allowed  on  St.  Paul  Island. 

8.  That  hereafter,  until  further  orders,  widows  and  their  families  shall  be  supplied  with 
coats  by  the  Government — the  ration  to  be  the  same  as  to  other  families. 

Monday  July  3rd  1893 

The  smoke  house  used  in  1892  for  smoking  and  curing  seal  meat  was  overhauled,  cleaned 
out  and  converted  into  a  coal  house  for  native  coal.  There  was  eleven  barrels  of  smoked 
shoulders  taken  out  of  same  but  as  the  natives  refuse  to  eat  same  they  were  thrown  away 
and  the  house  filled  with  coal.60 


Tuesday  July  4th  1893 

Day  bright  -  sun  shining  and  warm.  The  Government  House  decorated  with  American 
Flags.  The  forenoon  was  passed  by  the  natives  smoking  cigars  furnished  by  Company 
and  Government  agents  and  in  singing  songs  of  their  own  selection.  Their  rendition  of 
"America”  was  far  superior  to  what  we  often  hear  on  picnic  grounds  down  in  the  states. 
While  partaking  a  sumptuous  dinner  at  Co.  house  the  telephone  bell  rang  and  following 
it  came  the  information  from  the  watchmen  at  N.E.  Point.  “Schooner  in  sight!”  Soon  after 
dinner,  two  sail  boats  could  be  seen  from  top  of  hill  at  west  landing.  They  were  near  shore 
at  west  point.  Some  natives  fishing  about  two  miles  out  could  both  see  and  hear  them 
shooting  from  their  sail  boats.  Agent  Adams  accompanied  by  four  natives  went  on  guard 
at  S.W.  Bay  Rookery  and  west  point,  and  Agent  Crowley  accompanied  by  four  natives  went 
to  N.E.  Point  to  assist  the  guard  there  and  the  schooner  was  found  in  sight  as  reported, . . . 
until  about  11  o’clock  P.M  when  it  disappeared  from  sight. 

Who  is  having  the  best  time?  The  men  of  the  revenue  cutters  down  at  Unalaska  or  the  seal 
poachers  just  out  of  gunshot  reach  along  the  rookeries  of  St.  Paul  Island?61

Genealogy 

Richard  Guy  Culbertson  was  born  in  1895, 
at  Woodleaf,  North  Carolina.  During  a  fur¬ 
lough  from  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  1924,  Richard 
Culbertson  met  and  married  Mary  S.  Sandidge 
of  Lynchburg,  Virginia,  while  she  was  teaching  in 
Mooresville,  North  Carolina.  Richard  and  Mary 
Culbertson’s  son,  Richard  K.  Culbertson,  was  born 
at  St.  Paul  Island  in  1928.  After  retiring  from  gov¬ 
ernment  service,  Richard  Guy  Culbertson  resided 
in  Greenville,  North  Carolina,  until  his  death  on 
October  3,  1969.  Mary  Culbertson  subsequently

where  she  died  in  1988.63 

Biographical  Sketch 

Richard  Culbertson  was  educated  at  King 
Business  College  in  Charlotte,  North  Carolina. 

During  World  War  I,  he  joined  the  U.S.  Navy 
and  served  as  a  yeoman  on  the  supply  ship  USS 
Nashan,  which  worked  in  Alaskan  waters.  During  that  duty  Culbertson  became  familiar 
with  the  Pribilof  Islands,  and  in  1920  he  applied  for  a  position  with  the  Department  of 
Commerce. 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Richard  Culbertson  began  his  Pribilof  Islands  career  on  St.  George  Island  as  a  senior 
schoolteacher  in  1923.  The  following  sealing  season  he  became  an  assistant  agent,  a  posi¬ 
tion  he  maintained  for  three  years  while  alternating  as  a  teacher  during  the  off-season.  He

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


subsequently  served  on  St.  Paul  Island  as  the  agent,  storekeeper,  disbursing  officer,  jailer, 
and  “keeper  of  the  spirits”  [liquor]  from  late  1927  through  the  1929  sealing  season. 

Mary  Culbertson  organized  and  taught  “junior  school”  (kindergarten)  at  St.  George 
Island;  she  later  taught  in  the  junior  school  at  St.  Paul  Island.  Her  letters  home  during  the 
fall  of  1924  provided  her  parents  with  descriptive  views  into  everyday  island  life — living 
conditions,  means  of  communication,  social  activities,  and  occasional  electric  interrup¬ 
tions — as  excerpted  here: 


St.  George  Island,  Alaska 
Sept  2,  1924 

The  coast  guard  cutter  “Mojove”  brought  mail  from  Unalaska,  an  overnight  trip  from  here. 

As  soon  as  some  native  children,  who  have  the  keenest  eyes  ever,  saw  the  top  of  the  mast 
on  the  distant  horizon,  they  began  yelling,  “steamer,  steamer,”  at  the  top  of  their  voices. 

Soon  we  heard  her  steamer  whistle,  saw  her  anchor  flag  go  up,  and  then  our  men  put  off  in 
a  skin  boat  towed  by  the  launch  to  bring  in  our  mail  bags. 

...  I  am  afraid  that  Dick  and  I  are  going  to  be  disappointed  in  getting  our  own  house  this 
fall.  There  were  so  few  natives  here  to  work  during  the  season  that  it  has  taken  longer  to 
install  the  new  water  system  for  the  village.  The  cold  weather  may  set  in  before  the  concrete 
walls  can  be  poured  and  the  top  put  on.  Should  they  get  that  much  done  before  freezing  we 
would  be  o.k.  All  our  sand  and  gravel  has  to  be  brought  in  boats  from  a  beach  some  miles 
away.  This  can  only  be  done  when  the  sea  is  very  calm  too.  As  things  are  now,  we  couldn’t 
ask  to  be  more  comfortably  situated  except  for  a  place  to  do  our  own  cookies. 

. . .  For  the  last  week  we  have  had  company  in  our  house.  The  radio  operator  and  his  wife, 

Mr.  &  Mrs.  Picken,  who  are  packing  up  their  household  furniture  preparatory  to  going  to 
the  states  about  the  8  or  10  of  Sept.  That  means  that  our  radio  station  will  be  a  thing  of 
the  past.  But  we  have  been  blessed  with  a  radio  telephone  with  which  by  ringing  a  little 
buzzer  we  can  call  up  and  talk  with  the  people  on  St.  Paul  anytime.  All  messages  will  be 
telephoned  to  us  instead  of  being  sent  in  code.  We  often  hold  lengthy  conversations  with 
folks  forty  miles  away  with  no  connecting  wires  between! 

October  22,  1924 

Our  light  engine  is  crippled  these  days.  The  crank  shaft  broke  so  we  have  to  use  kerosene 
lamps  until  December  when  we  get  a  new  shaft. 

. . .  The  wind  blows  so  hard  that  the  carpet  ripples  and  the  wall  paper  rattles.  That’s  true! 

Not  in  our  apartment,  however,  but  upstairs  in  my  school  room  facing  the  north.  This 
house  is  about  fifty  years  old,  and  will  be  torn  down  next  year  which  is  not  any  too  soon. 

These  rooms  we  have  are  some  that  Dick  practically  built  over  last  year  before  he  came 
home  so  that  they  are  as  nice  as  can  be. 

Our  new  house  is  going  up  slowly.  The  basement  walls  have  been  poured,  and  the  men  are 
almost  ready  to  pour  the  first  floor  walls.  Then  comes  the  roof  making  a  place  the  men  can 
work  on  inside  all  winter.  We  can  watch  them  work  right  back  of  our  house  here. 

One  of  the  natives  is  making  me  an  ivory  comb.  He  makes  lovely  ones  too,  copies  patterns 
from  books.64 

The  Culbertson  family  left  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  1929,  when  the  U.S.  Bureau  of 
Fisheries  assigned  Richard  office  duties  at  Washington,  D.C.

Experience 

At  the  beginning  of  his  career  William  H.  Dall 
worked  with  Henry  Wood  Elliott  in  the  South 
Tower  Room  at  the  Smithsonian  Institution.  At 
the  time,  they  considered  themselves  friends. 
Together  in  1865,  they  took  advantage  of  an  op¬ 
portunity  to  participate  in  the  Western  Union

Alaska.  The  Expedition  was  divided  into  three  divisions:  Canadian,  Russian  American,  and 
Asian.  Although  Dali  and  Elliott  socialized  together  during  that  time,2  they  took  separate 
paths.  Dali  went  to  Russian  America,  including  the  Yukon  River  region,  whereas  Elliott 
went  with  the  Canadian  Division.  In  1866,  after  the  untimely  death  of  the  Expedition’s 
leader,  Robert  Kennicott  (1835-1866),  Dali,  then  an  aspiring  biologist  and  paleontolo¬ 
gist,  became  Director  of  the  Scientific  Corps  for  the  Expedition.3  When  in  1867  the 
Expedition  was  terminated  for  the  reason  of  obsolescence  following  the  successful  laying 
of  the  Atlantic  cable  to  Europe,  Dali  remained  in  Alaska  until  the  late  summer  of  1868 
to  conduct  further  exploration.4  Dali  credited  Henry  Elliott  in  his  book  Alaska  and  Its 
Resources  (1870):  “The  illustrations  are  all  from  original  sketches  by  the  writer,  or  from 
the  articles  themselves,  and  owe  whatever  artistic  merit  they  may  possess  to  the  pencil  of 
Mr.  H.  W.  Elliott.”  However,  it  appears  that  from  that  point  their  paths  began  to  part  (see 
Henry  Wood  Elliott  biography).5 

In  1892,  Dali  summarized  his  professional  experience  in  a  deposition  before  John 
J.  Malone  on  April  9,  1892,  for  the  U.S.  presentation  before  the  International  Fur-Seal 
Tribunal  of  Arbitration. 

That  in  connection  with  my  scientific  studies  at  Cambridge,  Mass.,  I  devoted  nearly  three 
years  to  the  study  of  biology,  anatomy,  and  medicine;  that  since  completing  my  studies  with 
Prof.  Louis  Agassiz  at  Cambridge  [Massachusetts],  in  the  year  1863, 1  have  been  engaged 
in  scientific  work,  and  am  now  a  paleontologist  in  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey.  I  first  visited 
Bering  Sea  in  the  summer  of  1865  as  a  member  of  the  scientific  corps  of  the  Western  Union 
Telegraph  expedition.  Visited  the  Aleutian  Islands  and  went  to  St.  Michael,  passing  near  the 
Pribilof  group. ...  In  the  fall  of  1868  I  made  my  way  back  to  San  Francisco  on  the  schooner

Francis  Steele,  owned  by  the  Pioneer  American  Fur  Company  [aka  Parrott  and  Company], 
which  had  a  station  at  St.  George  Island,  where  we  stopped  on  our  way  south,  and  thus 
gave  me  a  chance  to  observe  seal  life  for  several  weeks.  In  1871  I  joined  the  U.S.  Coast  and 
Geodetic  Survey  for  the  purpose  of  carrying  out  a  proposed  survey  of  the  Aleutian  chain  of 
islands.  I  was  thus  engaged  from  the  summer  of  1871  to  the  end  of  the  season. . . .  During 
this  period  had  opportunity  to  familiarize  myself  with  aquatic  seal  life,  and  in  1874  made  a 
reconnaissance  survey  of  the  Pribilof  Islands,  which  afforded  me  additional  opportunity  to 
observe  seal  life  on  the  rookeries.6 

Others  would  add  to  Dali’s  summary  of  professional  experience: 

In  addition  to  his  services  for  the  government  he  also  held  the  chair  of  invertebrate 
paleontology  in  the  Wagner  Institute  of  Science  in  Philadelphia  ...  he  received  in  1889,  the 
gold  medal  of  the  Institute.  During  1899-1915,  he  was  an  honorary  curator  of  the  Bishop 
Museum  in  Hawaii.7 

In  Dali’s  1892  deposition  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  he  included  comments  about 
his  1868  visit  to  St.  George  Island: 

During  my  visit  to  St.  George  Island  in  1868, 8  this  vast  territory  of 
Alaska  had  just  fallen  into  the  possession  of  the  United  States,  and  the 
Government  had  not  yet  fairly  established  more  than  a  beginning  of 
an  organization  for  its  management  as  a  whole,  without  mentioning 
such  details  as  the  Pribilof  Islands.  In  consequence  of  this  state  of 
affairs  private  enterprise,  in  the  form  of  companies  dealing  in  furs,  had 
established  numerous  sealing  stations  on  the  islands.  During  my  stay, 
except  on  a  single  occasion,  the  driving  from  the  hauling  grounds,  the 
killing,  and  skinning  was  done  by  the  natives  in  the  same  manner  as 
when  under  the  Russian  rule,  each  competing  party  paying  them  so 
much  per  skin  for  their  labor  in  taking  them.  Despite  the  very  bitter  and 
more  or  less  unscrupulous  competition  among  the  parties,  all  recognized 
the  importance  of  preserving  the  industry  and  protecting  the  breeding 
grounds  from  molestation,  and  for  the  most  part  were  guided  by  this 
conviction.9 

In  Alaska  and  Its  Resources,  Dall  proposed  that  the  Pribilof 
Islands’  Aleuts,  through  legislation,  be  the  sole  authorities  to  kill  fur 
seals  and  to  sell  the  pelts  to  trading  companies,  who  themselves  (i.e., 
the  companies)  would  be  required  to  pay  taxes  to  the  government  on 
each  pelt  purchased.10 

Dall  described  the  Pribilovians’  utilization  of  the  seal: 

The  flesh  of  a  young  fur-seal,  placed  in  running  water  overnight  and 
then  broiled,  is  far  from  disagreeable.  In  fact,  it  tastes  almost  exactly  like 

mutton-chop.  The  young  sea-lion  is  said  to  be  even  better  eating - The 

Aleuts  make  boot-soles,  which  are  very  durable,  of  the  skin  of  the  flippers. 

The  fat  cut  from  the  nearest  carcass  serves  them  for  fuel.  The  blubber  of 
the  fur-seal  makes  oil  of  the  first  quality,  and  is  worth  about  two  dollars  a 
gallon. . . .  Each  seal  will  make  half  a  gallon.11 

The  British  had  challenged  the  U.S.  claim  of  sovereignty  over  the 
entire  Bering  Sea  east  of  the  Russian  territorial  line  and  its  claim  to 
the  northern  fur  seal  both  on  the  high  seas  and  within  the  territorial  sea.  To  that  end, 
the  British  attempted  to  overturn  every  stone  concerning  the  Seal  Islands  to  uncover 
facts  and  opinions  in  support  of  their  case  before  an  International  Tribunal  of  Arbitration

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


convened  at  Paris,  France.  Respecting  Dali,  the  British  counsel  borrowed  his  following 
statements: 

I  have  not  arrived  at  that  point  where  I  should  believe  that  the  Government  habitually 
employs  dishonest  Agents,  though  long  experience  in  Alaska  might  shake  any  man’s 
optimism.12 

...  it  would  be  very  desirable  that  the  officers  of  the  United  States  employed  on  the 
Pribyloff  Islands  should  be  prohibited  from  receiving  pay  from,  or  rendering  services 
for  pay  to,  the  Company  whom,  practically,  they  are  placed  there  to  watch.  That  this  has 
occurred  in  several  instances  I  am  aware,  and  probably  in  some  cases  without  any  improper 
intent  on  either  side;  but  it  is  evident  at  once  that  it  opens  a  wide  door  for  scandal,  if  not  for 
fraud.13 

William  H.  Dali  was  appointed  Acting  Assistant  of  the  U.S.  Coast  Survey,  later  to 
become  the  U.S.  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey,  in  1871.  In  1884,  he  accepted  a  position 
as  paleontologist  with  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey,  which  assigned  him  to  the  National 
Museum  as  Curator  for  the  Division  of  Mollusks  and  Tertiary  Fossils.14  In  that  capacity, 
Dali  participated  in  the  Harriman  Expedition  to  Alaska,  which  included  a  stop  at  the 
Pribilof  Islands  in  1899. 

Dali  wrote  a  significant  number  of  scientific  publications  as  a  result  of  his  explo¬ 
rations  into  the  Alaska  frontier.  His  1870  publication  Alaska  and  Its  Resources  was  ac¬ 
cepted  for  many  years  as  the  authoritative  text  regarding  Alaska.15  Besides  the  Dali  sheep 
(originally  Dali’s  sheep),  several  geographical  features  in  Alaska  bear  Dali’s  name,  includ¬ 
ing  Dali  Island  in  Southeast  Alaska  and  Dali  Mountain  in  the  McKinley  Range.16  Among 
Dali’s  most  important  Aleutian  works  were  On  the  Remains  of  the  Later  Prehistoric  Man 
Obtained  from  Caves  in  the  Catherina  Archipelago,  Alaska  Territory,  and  Especially  from 
the  Caves  of  the  Aleutian  Islands  (1878)  and  On  Masks,  Labrets  and  Certain  Aboriginal 
Customs  with  an  Inquiry  into  the  Bearing  of  their  Geographic  Distribution  (1884).

Biographies  D  ♦  Dall  -  Duffield 


Biographical  Sketch 

William  Ward  Duffield  spent  the  majority  of 
his  adult  life  in  government  service  as  a  mili¬ 
tary  leader  and  civil  engineer.  President  Grover 
Cleveland  appointed  him  Superintendent  of  the 
U.S.  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey  at  Washington, 

D.C.,  in  1894.  Earlier  he  had  been  prominent 
as  a  civil  engineer  with  many  of  the  country’s 
major  railroad  construction  lines.  He  also  served 
two  terms  as  a  Michigan  state  senator.  Duffield 
received  his  degree  as  a  civil  engineer  from 
Columbia  College  [now  Columbia  University]  in 
New  York  City  in  1842. 

Duffield  ...  a  Senator  from  Wayne  County  in 
1879  . . .  became  a  resident  of  Detroit  in  1836. 

By  profession  a  civil  engineer,  also  a  member  William  Ward  Duffield.  (Middletown 

of  the  Detroit  bar.  He  was  adjutant  of  the  2d  Daily  Argus,  Middletown,  NY,  Oct.  9, 

Tennessee  in  the  Mexican  war;  was  engineer  and 

superintendent  of  railroads  in  New  York;  surveyed  the  Detroit  &  Milwaukee  railroad  in 
1852  from  Pontiac  to  Grand  Haven;  also  the  road  from  Detroit  to  Port  Huron,  and  from 
Mendota  to  Galesburg,  Ill.;  went  out  in  1861  as  lieutenant  colonel  of  the  4th  Michigan 
infantry,  and  became  colonel  of  the  9th  infantry;  commanded  23d  brigade,  was  military 
governor  of  Kentucky,  and  was  wounded  and  compelled  to  resign;  had  charge  of  coal  mines 
in  Pennsylvania  and  iron  mines  in  Kentucky,  and  was  chief  engineer  of  the  Kentucky  union 
railroad.18 

Duffield  had  also  worked  as  a  civil  engineer  surveying  government  lands  in  the  west¬ 
ern  Dakota  and  Colorado  territories  during  1869-1872.  He  was  made  chief  engineer  of 
the  Kentucky  Union  Railroad  in  1885  and  took  charge  of  the  survey  and  examination  of 
all  the  lands  of  that  line.  While  residing  in  Pineville,  Kentucky,  and  working  as  chief  engi¬ 
neer  building  the  Kentucky  Union  Railroad,  Duffield  received  word  from  Washington.19 

In  September,  1894,  General  Duffield  was  honored  by  President  Cleveland  with  the 
appointment  as  superintendent  of  the  Geodetic  Survey;  and  we  again  quote  from  the 
Detroit  Free  Press  of  September  26,  1894:  “The  appointment  of  General  W.W.  Duffield, 
of  Detroit,  to  be  superintendent  of  the  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey,  in  place  of  Professor 
T.C.  Mendenhall,  resigned,  was  announced  at  the  Treasury  Department,  Washington, 

September  25th.  The  position  is  worth  six  thousand  dollars  per  annum. . . .  The  selection 
of  General  Duffield  for  this  important  position  was  made  by  the  President  after  careful 
consideration  of  the  claims  and  qualifications  of  more  than  a  score  of  candidates,  several  of 
whom  possessed  unusual  scientific  attainments  in  the  line  of  work  of  the  survey.  General 
Duffield’s  great  experience  as  an  engineer,  and  especially  his  national  reputation  in  his 
profession,  which  guaranteed  that  his  appointment  would  be  well  received,  finally  decided 
the  President  in  his  favor. . . .  General  Duffield  is  an  earnest  and  lifelong  Democrat,  and 
was  elected  to  the  Michigan  State  Senate  of  1881  [also  1879],  He  was  alternate  at  large  for 
Don  M.  Dickinson  in  the  Democratic  National  Convention  in  1892.  His  qualifications  for 
the  important  position  to  which  he  has  been  nominated  are  everywhere  conceded,  and  his 
residence  in  different  portions  of  the  country  has  given  him  an  extensive  circle  of  warm 
friends  that  will  be  heartily  pleased  that  the  gallant  veteran  has  received  such  handsome 
recognition.20

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Several  months  after  taking  his  new  post,  Duffield  received  news  that  funds  would  be 
made  available  for  many  mapping  projects,  including  in  Alaska. 

Considerable  work  under  the  coast  and  geodetic  survey  has  been  made  possible  by 
the  Sundry  Civil  bill. ...  It  is  estimated  that  it  will  take  nearly  $20,000  to  conduct 
this  important  work. . . .  There  will  be  also  resurveys  of  San  Francisco  Harbor,  and  a 
continuation  of  the  exploration  of  the  waters  of  Alaska,  including  a  survey  of  the  Aleutian 
Islands  and  an  examination  of  the  mouth  of  the  Yukon  River.21 

During  mapping  in  1895,  Lt.  Commander  E.  K.  Moore,  USN,  named  Duffield 
Peninsula  on  the  north  coast  of  Baranof  Island  for  General  William  Ward  Duffield.22  The 
discovery  of  gold  in  the  Yukon  in  1896,  and  the  resulting  frenzy  of  the  Gold  Rush  gave 
new  urgency  to  a  longstanding  boundary  dispute  between  Alaska  and  Canada.  General 
Duffield’s  office  was  central  to  the  discussion. 

Washington,  Aug.  22.  -  Gen.  Duffield:  The  boundary  line  is  fixed  by  treaties  between  this 
country  and  Great  Britain  and  between  Russia  and  Great  Britain.  The  work  of  the  surveyors 
is  definitely  to  mark  the  lines  laid  down  by  those  treaties.  We  have  an  engineering  party 
engaged  in  that  labor,  and  so  have  the  English,  and  the  surveys  are  being  made  as  rapidly  as 
the  appropriations  and  the  seasons  will  permit.  When  the  work  is  completed,  a  report  will 
be  made  to  the  respective  Governments.23 

Nothing  can  be  done  more  than  already  has  been  done  toward  marking  the  boundary  line 
between  Alaska  and  the  British  possessions  along  the  one  hundred  and  forty-first  meridian 
until  the  Senate  passes  upon  the  boundary  treaty  now  before  it.  There  is,  however,  no  doubt 
of  the  location  of  the  line  along  this  meridian,  and  most  people  in  the  locality  know  where 
it  is. . . .  Gen.  Duffield  has  spent  considerable  time  in  Alaska.  He  expresses  the  opinion 
that  a  railroad  easily  can  be  constructed  from  Taku  Inlet  to  the  Klondike  gold  fields,  and 
believes  that  the  enterprise  will  be  worth  undertaking,  because  of  the  richness  of  the 
mines.24 

Duffield  was  also  quoted  as  saying: 

The  one  hundred  and  forty-first  meridian  was  designated  as  the  boundary  between  Russia 
and  Great  Britain,  and  nothing  remained  after  our  acceptance  of  that  understanding  but 
to  locate  the  meridian.  The  location  was  made  on  the  north  of  the  Porcupine  River  by  our 
surveyors,  and  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Yukon  by  the  Canadians  under  Ogilvie,  and  their  work 
there  checked  by  our  men.  We  found  that  where  the  Ogilvie  line  crossed  Forty  Mile  Creek 
it  was  15-100  of  a  second  or  six  feet  and  nine  inches  too  far  east,  and  where  it  crossed 
the  Yukon  it  was  14  seconds  or  618  feet  too  far  west.  Thus  it  may  be  seen  that  the  line  as 
located  by  Ogilvie  is  substantially  correct.  There  is  no  possibility  of  an  error  the  correction 
of  which  could  place  the  new  gold  region  in  American  territory.  The  nearest  point,  Dawson 
City,  is  fifty  miles  on  the  Canadian  side  of  the  Ogilvie  line.  If  the  treaty  now  before  the 
Senate  providing  for  fixing  the  boundary  is  ratified,  a  commission  will  be  appointed  to 
perform  this  duty.25 

The  Alaskan  boundary  dispute  that  had  plagued  Duffield’s  service  was  not  fully 
settled  for  another  twenty-eight  years.  In  1898,  a  Joint  High  Commission  between  the 
United  States  and  Great  Britain  was  formed  as  Duffield  had  suggested.  However,  five 
years  would  pass  before  an  agreement  on  the  dispute  would  be  reached.  On  January  24, 
1903,  the  two  nations  finally  agreed  to  appoint  an  Alaskan  Boundary  Tribunal  consisting 
of  six  impartial  judges  to  resolve  the  dispute.  The  majority  of  the  tribunal  decided  in  favor 
of  the  articles  in  question;  thus  the  boundary  along  hundreds  of  miles  in  Southeast  Alaska 
was  finally  settled  on  October  20,  1903.26  Two  other  treaties,  one  in  1908  and  another  in 
1925,  between  the  United  States  and  Great  Britain  also  addressed  the  Alaska-Canadian

boundary.  The  1908  treaty  provided  for  a  permanent  commission,  and  the  1925  treaty 
agreed  to  maintain  a  20-foot  wide  demarcation  along  the  border.2 

Having  been  appointed  by  President  Cleveland,  General  Duffield  was  requested  to 
resign,  as  was  the  custom,  when  the  administration  of  William  McKinley  took  office  in 
October  1897.  Duffield  stepped  down  on  November  30,  1897,  and  resided  with  his  wife 
in  Washington,  D.C.,  until  his  death.  His  replacement  as  Superintendent  of  the  Coast 
Survey  was  Dr.  Henry  Smith  Pritchett.28 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

“In  April  1897  the  coast  survey  was  directed  to  conduct  a  topographical  survey  of  the 
Pribilof  Islands  and  the  seal  rookeries,”  wrote  geographer  Donald  J.  Orth.  “Complete  top¬ 
ographical  surveys  were  made  of  St.  Paul,  St.  George,  Walrus,  and  Otter  Islands.  Results 
of  these  surveys  were  published  on  the  U.S.  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey  charts  in  1898.”29 
The  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s  Log  for  May  1897  noted: 

The  geodetic  surveying  party  was  landed.  Capt.  Tuttle  and  Dr.  Call  of  the  Bear  called  this 
morning.  The  surveying  party  consists  of: 

Wm.  Ward  Duffield,  chief;  Fremont  Morse,  Geo.  R.  Putnam  and  Geo.  L.  Flower,  assistants; 

Henry  J.  Slaken,  Joseph  E.  Freeman,  Wm.  S.  Broughton,  Chas.  H.  Roesch,  and  Fletcher 
G.  Forny,  Edward  P.  Rudolph  and  Gustov  Bergman,  workmen.  The  purpose  is  to  make  a 
minute  survey  of  the  Islands,  and  especially  the  seal  rookeries  thereon,  and  prepare  maps 
in  detail  of  the  same.30

United  States  in  the  panhandle  of  Alaska,  i.e.,  Southeast  Alaska.  The  Canadians  desired  a  boundary 
that  would  give  them  access  to  the  sea  via  the  heads  of  several  estuaries  or  fjords  along  the  coastal 
range  of  mountains.  The  United  States  sought  a  boundary  35  miles  (56  km)  easterly  of  the  coastal 
range.  The  tribunal  moved  the  United  States’  claim  a  bit  westward  of  its  preferred  boundary,  but  left

Elkins,  Stephen  Benton  (1841-1911) 

Secretary  of  War,  International  Fur-Seal  Arbitration,  1891-1893 
U.S.  Senator,  West  Virginia,  1895-1911 

Genealogy 

Stephen  Benton  Elkins  was  born  near  New 
Lexington,  Perry  County,  Ohio,  on  September  26, 

1841,  to  Philip  Duncan  Elkins  and  Sarah  (Withers) 

Elkins.  Stephen  Benton  Elkins  married  twice. 

Elkins  married  his  first  wife,  Sarah  Simms  Jacobs, 
on  June  10,  1866.  Stephen  and  Sarah  Elkins  had 
two  daughters:  Katherine  and  Sarah.  His  second 
marriage,  in  1875,  was  to  Hallie  Davis,  daughter  of 
Senator  Henry  Gassaway  Davis  of  West  Virginia. 

Stephen  and  Hallie  Elkins  produced  five  more 
children:  Davis,  Stephen  B.  Jr.,  Richard,  Blaine, 
and  Catherine  Elkins.  The  senior  Elkins  died  at 
Washington,  D.C.,  on  January  5,  191 1.1 


Biographical  Sketch 

Stephen  Elkins  graduated  from  the  University  of 
Missouri  at  Columbia  in  1860.  He  taught  for  a 
time  but  continued  his  studies  in  law  and  in  1864 
was  admitted  to  the  Missouri  Bar.  That  same  year 
he  signed  on  as  a  cattle  drover  and  ended  up  at  Albuquerque  in  the  New  Mexico  Territory.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Upon  his  arrival  [in  New  Mexico],  he  began  to  learn 
Spanish  so  he  could  represent  those  living  in  the 
area.  Within  one  year,  the  people  so  respected  Elkins 
that  they  elected  him  to  the  territorial  house  of 
representatives.  He  served  in  that  body  from  1864  to 
1865,  and  then  worked  as  territorial  district  attorney 
in  1866.  President  Andrew  Johnson  in  1867  named 
Elkins  territorial  attorney  general  and  charged  him 
with  ending  slavery  in  the  territory.2 

Elkins  served  as  a  U.S.  district  attorney  from 
1870  to  1872.  In  a  subsequent  business  career  he 
became  “a  wealthy  railroad  baron  by  the  1880’s 
. . .  a  prosperous  businessman  who  had  invested  in 
land  and  mining.”3 

The  1910  U.S.  Census  taken  at  the  town  found¬ 
ed  by  Stephen  Elkins  in  Randolph  County,  West 
Virginia,  recorded  his  sons  as  having  joined  their 
father  as  railroad  and  mining  executives.

Directory  of  the  United  States  Congress,

Elkins  spent  the  remainder  of  his  life  in  gov¬ 
ernment  service,  ending  with  his  time  as  U.S. 
Senator  for  West  Virginia  from  1895  to  1911. 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Elkins  had  been  an  “American  lawyer,  industrialist,  and  political  leader,”4  and  his  political 
loyalties  led  to  his  service  as  Secretary  of  War  beginning  in  1891.  During  his  tenure,  the 
international  dispute  over  pelagic  sealing  (the  killing  of  seals  in  open  waters)  in  the  Bering 
Sea  escalated  and  led  to  an  International  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  at  Paris,  France.  The 
Tribunal  was  expected  to  resolve  the  dispute  over  sovereign  rights  to  the  Bering  Sea  and 
a  U.S.  claim  to  sole  ownership  of  northern  fur  seals,  outside  of  Russia  and  Japan,  follow¬ 
ing  the  purchase  of  Russian  America.  Elkins  and  Secretary  of  State  James  Gillespie  Blaine, 
both  members  of  President  Benjamin  Harrison’s  (1889-1893)  Cabinet,  spoke  fervently 
against  pelagic  sealing.  Harrison’s  administration  argued  for  “an  international  agreement 
under  which  the  sealing  interests  of  the  United  States  might  be  fairly  protected  and  the 
seals  of  the  Northern  Pacific  Ocean  saved  from  wanton  destruction.” 

The  former  [1885-1889]  Secretary  [Thomas  Francis]  Bayard  had  not  contended  for  any 
exclusive  jurisdiction  on  the  part  of  the  United  States  in  the  waters  of  Bering  Sea  beyond 
the  ordinary  limit  of  a  marine  league  from  the  coast.  His  negotiations  were  interrupted 
after  the  failure  to  ratify  the  treaty  relating  to  the  Atlantic  fisheries,  and  the  result  of  the 
political  canvass  of  1888  had  prevented  their  resumption.  The  subject  was  necessarily 
opened  by  Mr.  Harrison’s  Administration  in  consequence  of  the  seizure  of  British  vessels 
in  the  effort  to  prevent  unauthorized  sealing  within  what  were  legally  designated  as  the 
Waters  of  Alaska.5 

Newspapers  quickly  linked  the  outspoken  criticisms  against  pelagic  sealing  by  the 
wealthy  and  influential  Secretary  of  War,  Stephen  Elkins,  to  his  social,  political  and  finan¬ 
cial  affiliations  with  the  owners  of  the  North  American  Commercial  Company  (NACC).

Biographies  E  ♦  Elkins  -  Elliott 


After  the  NACC  received  the  highly  contentious  and  much  sought-after  twenty-year  mo¬ 
nopoly  to  harvest  the  fur  seal  (1890-1909),  critics  portrayed  Elkins  and  the  NACC  as  a 
single  entity.  Headlines  in  the  New  York  Times  and  Washington  Post  referred  to  the  com¬ 
pany  as  “Elkins’s  Company”  as  in  the  following  New  York  Times  article  of  June  20,  1891: 

ELKINS’S  COMPANY  PROTESTS 
IT  WILL  CLAIM  DAMAGES— IT  ALSO  OFFERS  SOME  ADVICE. 

Washington,  June  19. — The  North  American  Commercial  Company  of  San  Francisco, 
lessee  of  the  right  to  take  fur  seal  on  the  islands  of  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  in  Alaska,  for  the 
period  of  twenty  years  from  May  1,  1890,  have  filed  a  protest  with  the  Acting  Secretary  of 
the  Treasury  against  a  close  season.6 

The  company  represents  that  it  has  faithfully  complied  with  all  requirements  of  the  law  and 
has  obeyed  all  orders  and  directions  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  relating  to  the  same. 

It  calls  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  lease  to  them  was  let  under  contract  and  that,  relying 
upon  the  Government’s  assurance,  it  agreed  to  pay  a  sum  three  times  greater  than  that  paid 
by  the  former  lessee.7 

Elkins’  Executive  Department  position  failed  to  alter  the  Treasury  Department’s  de¬ 
cision  to  limit  sealing  on  the  Pribilof  Islands,  thereby  denying  the  NACC  the  right  to 
exercise  its  original  lease  term  to  take  100,000  seals  per  year.  During  its  first  year  the 
company  secured  25,152  sealskins  and  in  1896  it  secured  30,004.  Annual  takes  during 
its  twenty-year  lease  typically  varied  from  approximately  7,000  to  19,000.8  The  govern¬ 
ment  reportedly  received  $3,235,063  in  gross  revenues  from  the  NACC,  while  it  spent 
$5,472,607  to  protect  the  fur  seals  during  the  20-year  leasing  period.  The  result  was  a  net 
revenue  loss  of  $2,237,544.9 

After  President  Harrison  failed  to  secure  a  second  term  in  office,  Stephen  B.  Elkins 
returned  to  private  practice  in  1893.

Daughter  of  St.  Paul  Island  Russian  Governor  Alexander  Milovidov 
Instructor  of  Russian  Language  and  Wife  of  Henry  Wood  Elliot 

Genealogy 

Alexandra  Milovidov  Elliott  was  born  on  March  27,  1856,  at  Kodiak,  Russian  America, 
the  first  of  two  daughters  of  Russian-American  Company  Agent  Alexander  (Aleksandr 
Alfeev)  Milovidov  and  his  wife  Alexandra  (Aleksandra  Mikhailova)  Kaminsky  (Kaminskii) 
Milovidov,  a  Creole.  Alexander  Milovidov  moved  his  family  to  St.  Paul  Island  during 
1861.  At  the  age  of  sixteen,10  Alexandra  married  Assistant  U.S.  Treasury  Agent  Henry 
Wood  Elliott,  nine  years  her  senior,  at  St.  Paul  Island  on  July  21,  1872.  The  couple’s  first 
child,  Grace,  was  born  on  the  island  in  1873.  After  Grace’s  birth,  the  family  moved  over 
to  St.  George  where  they  spent  the  summer. 

Later  that  year,  Henry,  Alexandra,  and  Grace  Elliott  resettled  in  Henry’s  hometown 
of  Rockport  (later  Lakewood),  Ohio.  Henry  and  Alexandra  Elliott  raised  ten  children: 
Grace  (1873-1980),  born  on  St.  Paul  Island;  Flora  (1876-1974),  who  married  John  N.

Biographical  Sketch 

Alexandra  Milovidov  and  Henry  Elliott  married  at  the  Church  of  Saints  Peter  and  Paul 
on  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska,  on  July  21,  1872  (see  next  page).  Some  historians  have  offered 
that  the  couple  was  wed  at  Unalaska,  250  miles  to  the  south,  because  there  was  no  resi¬ 
dent  priest  in  the  Pribilofs  at  that  time.  One  source  specifically  (and  erroneously)  stated, 
“Visiting  priest  Nikolai  F.  Kovrigin  of  Sitka  performed  the  ceremony  [at  Unalaska].  Six 
witnesses  included  prominent  representatives  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company.”16 
Father  Nikolai  of  Sitka  was  indeed  away  on  visitation,  but  not  at  Unalaska  at  the  time  of 
Alexandra’s  marriage;  he  was  at  St.  Paul  Island.  Father  Nikolai  had  boarded  the  ship  H.M. 
Hutchinson  at  Unalaska  and  traveled  to  St.  Paul  Island  to  perform  his  parochial  duties. 
Several  excerpts  from  Agent  Charles  Bryant’s  Log  place  him  on  St.  Paul  in  July: 

Friday  July  19,  1872 

During  the  night  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company’s  Steam  Schooner  H.M.  Hutchinson, 

[arrived]  with  Capt  A.  Nielson,  one  of  the  firms  making  the  annual  visit  to  their  different 
trading  posts  in  the  Territory.  The  schooner  also  has  unloaded  a  passenger  Father  Nicholi 
[sic],  a  priest  of  the  Russian  Greek  Church  making  a  tour  to  minister  to  the  spiritual  wants 
of  the  people.  [The]  vessel  has  also  several  other  passengers.  [A]fter  breakfast  the  party 
landed  and  the  weather  being  foul  the  vessel  got  under  weigh  [sic]  and  stood  out  to  sea  for 
an  offing  [word  legibility  uncertain].  Father  Nicholi  proceeding  at  once  to  his  parochial 
duties.

Saturday  July  20th 

In  the  evening  four  native  couples  were  married  by  the  priest. 

Sunday  July  21st 

Weather  hazy  with  light  west  wind  and  fog  at  times  in  afternoon.  Schooner  H.M. 

Hutchinson  came  to  anchor  off  the  East  Landing. 

In  the  evening  Assistant  Treas.  Agent  Henry  W.  Eliott  [sic]  was  joined  in  marriage  to  Miss 
Alexandra  Melovedoff  according  to  the  rites  of  the  Greek  Church  of  which  the  bride  is  a 
member.17 

The  day  after  the  wedding  Henry  Elliott  wrote  to  “My  dear  old  Friend,”  William  H. 
Dali,  about  his  bride: 

Captain  Niebaum  will  tell  you  of  my  marriage  to  the  daughter  of  the  late  Russian  Governor 
of  the  Island  and  as  we  have  a  good  piano  here  and  Mrs.  Bryant’s  society,  I  think  she’ll  make 
quite  a  woman  for  any  position  in  life,  even  though  she  was  born  and  raised  in  Alaska: 
her  physique  is  superb  and  she  is  exceedingly  quick  and  ambitious  of  learning.  She  is  my 
"voucher  of  no  uncertain  signature”  for  the  Russian  language,  which  I  now  begin  to  use 
quite  freely.18 

Elliott’s  later  critics,  and  they  were  many,  charged  that  he  often  sought  to  elevate  him¬ 
self  by  association.  Although  the  record  indicates  that  he  did  frequently  use  other  people 
for  his  own  gain,  his  marriage  does  not  seem  to  be  such  an  instance.  However,  Alexandra 
was  instrumental  in  Elliott’s  understanding  of  Aleut  folk  lore  and  historical  Russian  re¬ 
cords,19  such  as  Ivan  Veniaminov’s  Zapiski  ob  ostrovakh  Unalashkinskago  otdeyla  ( Notes 
on  the  Islands  of  the  Unalashka  District ),  which  Elliott  applied  to  his  various  writings.  As 
best  he  could  Henry  Elliott  protected  his  Alaskan  Creole  wife  from  the  cruel  disparage¬ 
ment  of  the  often  racist  society  of  the  time.20 

In  an  1873  letter,  Henry  Elliott  wrote  to  Dali,  his  former  roommate  at  the  Smithsonian, 
as  he,  Alexandra,  and  their  baby  Grace  departed  the  island.  He  quipped,  “Don’t  throw  in 
any  sarcasm  about  the  baby  here,  I  tell  you  my  wife  is  a  splendid  little  woman  and  the 
baby  is  ‘the  very  image’  etc.”21  Author  Margaret  Manor  Butler  later  reflected  on  Alexandra 
Elliott: 

In  1873  he  brought  his  young  wife  and  baby  daughter  Grace  back  home  to  Rockport. 

Residents  were  very  friendly  to  the  petite  brown-eyed  Russian  wife,  who  found  English 
such  a  difficult  language.  They  admired  her  beauty  and  her  long  black  hair— so  long  she 
could  sit  on  it.  She  loved  flowers  and  gardening  and  was  very  devoted  to  her  growing 

family,  which  finally  numbered  ten  children - When  Alexandra  was  first  introduced 

to  Cleveland  social  circles,  she  created  quite  a  stir.  Friends  and  curious  acquaintances 
deposited  their  decorated  calling  cards  and  stayed  for  a  brief  chat  with  the  very  young 
and  attractive  Mrs.  Elliott.  Her  beauty  was  something  to  be  talked  about— blue  black  hair 
arranged  in  a  coiled  braid  on  top  of  her  head,  clear  beautiful  skin,  a  petite  figure,  and  brown 
eyes  with  a  depth  of  understanding  that  bridged  the  gap  of  language,  and  a  ready  smile  that 
won  her  a  host  of  friends. 

It  was  she  who  before  long  assumed  the  responsibility  of  raising  their  ten  children  in  a 
strange  land,  while  her  husband  found  his  life  work  in  Alaska  and  Washington,  D.C.  His 
career  proved  a  turbulent  one,  and  the  commotion  in  a  household  of  twelve  seemed  mild  in 
contrast  to  the  confusion  in  congressional  circles.” 

The  long  absences  of  Alexandra’s  husband,  coupled  with  his  devotion  to  the  fur  seal 
cause,  presumably  led  to  the  couple’s  separation  by  1920.  Thereafter,  individual  members

of  the  family  moved  west— Grace  to  California  farm  country,  and  Lionel,  John,  Louise, 
Edith,  and  Marsha  to  Seattle,  Washington.  Alexandra  remained  in  Lakewood  with  her 
son  Frank  for  a  time  but,  by  1930,  she  had  joined  her  daughter  Grace  near  San  Francisco. 
The  1930  U.S.  Census  recorded  her  as  Alexandra  Melovidoff  rather  than  Elliott.  She  re¬ 
mained  in  California  farm  country  until  her  death  in  1949.  After  her  mother’s  death, 
Grace  moved  to  Seattle,  Washington.23

Genealogy 

Henry  Wood  Elliott  was  born  on  November  13,  1846,  at 
Cleveland,  Ohio,  to  Franklin  Reuben  Elliott,  a  horticultur¬ 
ist,  and  Sophia  Appolonia  (Hopkins)  Elliott.  At  the  time,  the 
family  lived  in  “the  old  Governor  [Reuben]  Wood  mansion 
in  Rocky  River  [Ohio]  where  their  children,  Henry  Wood, 
Frank,  Katherine,  Cara,  and  Cora  were  born.”24  Henry  was 
apparently  given  his  middle  name  after  the  prestigious 
Governor  Wood  of  Ohio,  in  whose  former  home  the  Elliott 
family  resided.25  At  twenty-five,  Henry  Wood  Elliott  married 
a  sixteen-year-old  Creole  named  Alexandra  Milovidov26  at 
St.  Paul  Island  on  July  21, 1872. 2  Alexandra  was  the  daughter 
of  Alexander  and  Alexandra  Kaminsky  Milovidov.  Alexander 
Milovidov  was  the  last  governor  on  the  Seal  Islands  for  the 
Russian-American  Company  (see  Alexandra  Elliott’s  biog¬ 
raphy).  Henry  and  Alexandra  Elliott’s  first  child,  Grace,  was  born  on  St.  Paul  in  1873. 
After  leaving  the  Seal  Islands,  the  Elliott  family  grew  to  include  ten  children  while  living 
at  Lakewood  (previously  Rockport),  Ohio.  From  their  home  in  Lakewood,  Henry  regu¬ 
larly  commuted  to  Washington,  D.C.,  and  intermittently  to  Alaska.  Eventually  he  went 
into  debt  (see  endnote  42),  and  he  and  Alexandra  separated  for  unknown  reasons.  Henry 
Wood  Elliott  died  at  age  eighty-four  in  Seattle,  Washington,  on  May  25,  1930.28 

Biographical  Sketch 

Henry  Wood  Elliott’s  father,  Franklin  Elliott,  was  a  close  friend  of  physician  and  natural 
scientist  Dr.  Jared  P.  Kirtland,  who  founded  the  Cleveland  Academy  of  Science.  Despite 
some  significant  financial  setbacks,  Franklin  Elliott  managed  to  purchase  a  22-acre  lot  in

Rockport,  Ohio,  next  door  to  Dr.  Kirtland,  who  helped 
him  to  procure  the  land.  Franklin  then  “concentrated 
his  energy  in  turning  the  place  into  a  paradise  with 
rare  shrubs  and  flowers  and  fruit  trees  of  every  va¬ 
riety, ”2C'  as  well  as  tennis  courts,  grape  vineyards, 
summer  houses,  winding  paths,  and  a  pond  with  a 
large  collection  of  goldfish.  Franklin  Elliott  eventually 
published  the  widely  acclaimed  Elliott’s  Fruit  Book; 
or  the  American  Fruit-Grower’s  Guide  in  Orchard 
and  Garden.  It  was  in  this  setting  that  the  adolescent 
Henry  began  developing  his  artistic  talent.  Through 
his  father’s  scientific  associations  with  men  such  as 
Smithsonian  Secretary  Joseph  Henry  and  Assistant 
Secretary  Spencer  Baird,  Henry  would  springboard 
into  renown  and  occasional  notoriety.30

Henry’s  father  secured  a  position  for  his  six- 
teen-year-old  son,31  who  was  still  in  high  school, 
under  Joseph  Henry,  Secretary  of  the  Smithsonian 
Institution.  Many  of  Elliott’s  contemporaries  were 
uncertain  as  to  whether  Henry  had  just  an  honor¬ 
ary  position,  as  suggested  by  Elliott  historian  Robert 

Shalkop,32  or  whether  he  had  no  official,  professional  affiliation  at  all  with  the  presti¬ 
gious  institution,  even  though  he  boarded  there  during  his  early  years  and  kept  in  com¬ 
munication  with  senior  members  of  the  institution.  The  U.S.  House  Ways  and  Means 

Committee  queried  Elliott  about  his  affilation 
with  the  Smithsonian  Institution  during  its  1876 
inquiry  into  the  business  affairs  of  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company:

Q.  You  are  connected  with  the  Smithsonian? 

A.  I  am  an  associate  of  the  Smithsonian.  They  give 
me  a  room  where  I  sleep,  and  a  working-room,  in 
return  for  my  voluntary  services  as  a  collector.33 

In  1884,  he  answered  a  similar  question  asked 
by  Congressman  Morrison,  chairman  of  the  same 
committee,  “I  thought  that  you  were  connected 
with  the  Smithsonian  Institution.”  Elliott  replied, 
“Only  as  an  associate  and  collaborateur’.’34  During 
his  early  years  at  the  Smithsonian,  the  young 
Elliott  met  and  roomed  with  William  H.  Dali, 
who  would  become  a  leading  scientist  and  rec¬ 
ognized  authority  on  the  subject  of  Alaska  (see 
Dali’s  biography).  Dali  also  spoke  before  a  con-

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People _ 

gressional  committee  about  Elliott’s  affiliation 
with  the  Smithsonian: 

Elliott  occasionally  occupied  a  sleeping  cuddy 
in  one  of  the  towers  in  exchange  for  voluntary 
service — a  loose  connection  he  readily  admitted.35 

Elliott’s  Smithsonian  experience  may  have  in¬ 
advertently  taught  him  to  seek  advantage  in  order 
to  compete  among  formally  trained  academics, 
as  it  appears  he  never  completed  high  school. 
Through  their  Smithsonian  connections,  Elliott 
and  William  Dali  acquired  positions  with  the 
1865-1867  Western  Union  Telegraph  Expedition 
(aka  Collins  Overland  Expedition,  and  the 
Russian-American  Telegraph  Expedition).  The 
Expedition  was  divided  into  three  divisions: 
Canadian,  Russian  American,  and  Asian.  36  Dali 
and  Elliott  socialized  together  during  that  time, 
but  the  two  later  took  separate  paths.  Dali  went  to 
Russian  America  and  the  Yukon  River  area,  and 
Elliott  went  with  the  Canadian  Division,  where  he 
became  a  telegraph  operator.  In  1867,  the  Expedition  was  terminated  because  the  Trans- 
Siberian  telegraph  was  no  longer  considered  practical.  However,  Dali  stayed  in  Alaska 
to  conduct  further  exploration  until  1868,  while  Elliott  stayed  in  Canada  as  a  telegraph 
operator  until  circa  1870. 

Elliott’s  interests  in  natural  history  waned  due  to  his  growing  interest  in  the  telegraph. 
He  became  an  expert  telegraph  operator  with  the  Canadian  Division.  Self-conscious 
about  his  change  of  heart  for  natural  history,  Elliott  wrote  to  Professor  Joseph  Henry,  his 
mentor  at  the  Smithsonian: 

As  month  after  month  has  passed  by  the  mortifying  thought  of  my  failure  to  make, 
and  send  to  the  Smithsonian  a  Natural  History  Collection!.]  [My  failure  to  make  such  a 
collection]  has  caused  me  to  burn  several  letters  that  have  been  written  for  my  friends  at 
the  Smithsonian.37 

Elliott  also  wrote: 

I  am  much  pleased  with  the  telegraph  business  and  they  tell  me  that  I  have  acquired  it  very 

rapidly  having  had  about  six  months  practice - Please  . . .  tell  them  [the  Baird  family  and 

others]  that  so  completely  devoid  of  romance  or  interest  has  wild  life  become  to  me,  that  I 
cannot  bring  myself  to  write  to  them  of  it.38 

Henry  Elliott’s  romance  with  the  telegraph  waned  quickly.  In  1871,  he  accepted 
a  position  as  the  official  artist  for  the  Hayden  Survey  of  the  Yellowstone  region.39  The 
survey’s  prominent  guest  artists,  Thomas  Moran  and  William  Henry  Jackson,  became 
Elliott’s  mentors,  and  it  was  their  art  works,  rather  than  Elliott’s,  that  filled  most  of  the 
illustrated  pages  in  Hayden’s  report,  the  document  that  convinced  Congress  to  designate 
Yellowstone  as  the  nation’s  first  National  Park  in  1872.40  From  this  experience,  Elliott

likely  grasped  the  significance  of  landscape  art  as  an  influence  on  public  opinion,  and 
his  association  with  Moran  and  Jackson  could  only  have  helped  him  to  develop  his  own 
artistic  mastery.  But  Dali’s  1870  Alaska  and  Its  Resources  probably  inspired  Elliott  even 
more.  In  April  1872,  Elliott  wrote  his  former  roommate: 

Dear  Dali,  I  am  going  to  St.  Pauls  [sic]  nominally  as  an  Agent  of  the  Government  assisting 
Capt.  Bryant  but  really  to  make  as  big  a  collection  as  I  can  and  collect  as  much  material 
for  a  monograph  of  the  Seal  Islands  as  I  can  during  my  stay  out  there  which  keeps  me  until 
October  1873.41 

One  biographer  described  Henry  Wood  Elliott’s  personality  as  “dogmatic,  logical,  in¬ 
temperate,  courageous,  tactless,  idealistic,  and  fundamentally  quixotic,  suffering  many 
defeats  with  undiminished  faith  in  the  final  triumph  of  justice.  We  find  scant  reference, 
however,  to  any  aspect  of  his  life  not  related  to  seals.”42 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Henry  Wood  Elliott  arrived  at  the  Seal  Islands  on  April  24,  1872,  before  the  appearance 
of  any  significant  numbers  of  migratory  wildlife.  While  he  dreamed  of  making  a  mark  for 


229 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


himself  as  a  natural  historian,  he  could  not  have  envisioned  what  challenges  and  oppor¬ 
tunities  lay  before  him. 

Beginning  with  Elliott’s  first  St.  Paul  assignment,  and  with  some  poetic  license,  author 
James  Thomas  Gay  praised  Elliott’s  devotion  to  the  conservation  of  the  fur  seal. 

From  the  first  day  he  landed  on  the  islands  and  viewed  the  staggering  spectacle  of  countless 
seals  on  the  rookeries,  his  fascination  ripened  [Elliott  landed  in  April  when  seals  are 
essentially  absent  from  the  islands;  if  any  were  present  it  wasn’t  a  “staggering  spectacle’’]. 

Soon  he  developed  such  a  passionate  interest  in  the  animals  that  his  observations,  study 
and  note  taking  occupied  most  of  his  time.  He  made  numerous  sketches  and  drawings 
of  seal  life  as  well  as  of  the  islanders.  It  was  from  these  early  experiences  on  the  islands, 
apparently,  that  Elliott  developed  his  life-long  admiration  for  the  fur  seal.43 

Soon  after  his  arrival  at  the  Seal  Islands,  Elliott  felt  less  suited  for  his  official  role  of 
Treasury  Agent.  He  determined  to  devote  his  energies  more  appropriately,  as  expressed 
in  a  May  1872  letter  to  his  mentor  of  sorts,  Professor  Spencer  Baird: 

As  soon  as  I  shall  have  finished  my  work  this  summer  on  St.  George  I  shall  come  down  and 
resign  my  position  as  Government  Agent  for  I  wish  to  retire  into  private  life  where  I  can 
devote  myself  entirely  to  art  for  I  have  already  made  such  progress  with  the  management 
of  color  during  the  past  winter  that  I  do  not  fear  entering  into  competition  with  the  best  of 
artists. 

I  now  have  painted  a  gallery  of  seventy  five  pictures  eighteen  inches  by  twelve  which 
illustrate  the  wonderful  life  on  these  Islands  and  the  peculiarities  of  Bering  Sea.  This 
series  of  paintings  I  value  at  $15,000.  The  copyright  alone  to  it  I  shall  dispose  of  to  some 
leading  photographer  for  a  sum  not  less  than  $5000  -  and  have  made  from  it  a  series  of 
transparencies  or  glass  slides  for  a  lime  lighted  magic  lantern  to  illustrate  a  lecture  which  I 
have  prepared  upon  the  subject.44 

Also,  in  1872  Elliott  wrote: 

See  about  getting  my  successor,  for  there  is  work  yet  for  scientific  collections,  and  by  that 
procedure  prevent  some  dissatisfied  pothouse  politician  from  coming  up  and  making 
mischief.45 

Henry  Elliott’s  credentials  as  a  naturalist  and  artist,  especially  on  the  subject  of  the 
Seal  Islands,  would  grow  over  the  next  four  decades,  and  he  would  speak  before  vari¬ 
ous  congressional  committees  on  numerous  occasions,  either  lobbying  to  protect  the  fur 
seals  or  as  a  witness  during  investigations  of  misconduct  by  leasing  companies  and/or 
government  officials. 

I  first  visited  those  islands  in  April  1872,  by  the  joint  action  of  Prof.  Spencer  F.  Baird, 
then  assistant  secretary  of  the  Smithsonian  Institution,  and  Secretary  Boutwell,  Treasury 
Department.  The  Secretary  allowed  me  to  go  up  as  an  assistant  Treasury  agent,  with 
the  distinct  understanding  that  I  was  to  be  allowed  time  to  engage  in  these  (sealing) 
investigations,46  and  when  through,  to  return  without  leave  of  absence.  When  I  got  up 
there  I  had  an  idea  that  I  should  be  able  to  come  back  the  same  year,47  but  I  found  things  so 
different  from  what  I  had  understood,  that  I  made  another  visit  in  1874,  under  authority  of 
a  special  act  of  Congress;  and  again  in  1876,  on  my  own  responsibility.48 

As  previously  suggested,  it  remains  unclear  whether  Elliott  received  his  commission 
as  assistant  Treasury  agent  to  actually  study  fur  seals,  as  some  authors  maintain,49  or  as 
his  letter  to  Dali  suggested,  he  withheld  his  own  agenda  to  write  a  “monograph  of  the  Seal 
Islands”  from  his  Smithsonian  benefactors  and  employer.  Regardless,  he  did  correspond

frequently  with  Professor  Baird  at  the  Smithsonian,  who  thus  kept  abreast  of  Elliott’s 
findings  on  the  Seal  Islands.50 

In  pursuit  of  compiling  his  monograph,  Elliott  sought  out  scientist  Dr.  Elliott  Coues, 
who,  in  1872,  had  just  published  his  famous  Key  to  North  American  Birds.  Elliott  sent 
Coues  bird  specimens  he  collected  on  the  Pribilofs  for  identification,  along  with  his  field 
notes.  Although  Elliott  implied  in  a  letter  to  Dali  that  he  (H.  W.  Elliott)  would  write  the 
chapter  on  ornithology,  that  did  not  come  to  pass.51  By  the  fall  of  1873,  Elliott  had  pro¬ 
duced  his  monograph,  Report  of  the  Prybilov  Group,  or  Seal  Islands,  of  Alaska,  but  Dr. 
Coues  wrote  the  chapter  titled  “Ornithology  of  the  Prybilov  Islands,”  an  impressive  ad¬ 
dition  to  Elliott’s  1873  manuscript.52  Unfortunately  for  both  authors,  some  statements  in 
Elliott’s  report  outraged  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  William  Richardson.  Elliott  had  written 
numerous  vulgar  comments  about  Alaska  Natives.  For  example:  “I  cannot  speak  highly  of 
their  chastity  [although]  the  women  seldom  sell  themselves.”53  Also,  “These  people  are  ex¬ 
ceedingly  thoughtless  and  improvident,  shiftless  and  dirty,  all  exist,  even  the  best  of  them, 
as  a  matter  of  course,  with  one  or  two  exceptions,  in  a  state  of  profound  ignorance.”54  He 
also  made  unfavorable  allegations  against  the  government,  charging  that  agents  on  the 
island  were  “entirely  incompetent  or  dishonest.”  Secretary  Richardson  ordered  the  Report 
pulled  off  the  Government  Printing  Office’s  press,  and  the  already-printed  copies  were 
discarded  in  a  trash  bin. 

Elliott  claimed  that  only  seventy-five  copies  of  his  work  were  printed  before  the  press 
was  shut  down.  Purportedly,  he  recovered  all  seventy-five  copies  from  the  trash.55  Only 
a  few  are  known  to  remain  today.56  James  E.  Harting’s  The  Fauna  of  the  Prybilov  Islands 
included  excerpts  about  fauna  from  Elliott’s  contraband  Report  of  the  Prybilov  Group,  or 
Seal  Islands,  of  Alaska.  Harting  stated  in  his  Preface:

Biographies  E  ♦  Elliott 


During  the  early  part  of  1874  (Dr.  Coues  informs 
me  that  the  work  referred  to,  although  dated 
1873,  was  not  actually  published  until  either 
January  or  February  1874),  a  valuable  report  on 
this  remarkable  group  of  islands,  by  Mr.  H.  W. 

Elliott  and  Dr.  Elliott  Coues,  was  published  by  the 
American  Government.  As  I  learn  from  one  of  the 
authors  that  only  seventy-five  copies  of  the  work 
were  issued,  and  as  I  have  reason  to  believe,  the 
only  copy  in  England  is  the  one  now  before  me. 

Subsequent  to  his  failed  attempt  to  publish 
his  monograph,  Elliott  submitted  A  Report  upon 
the  Condition  of  Affairs  in  the  Territory  of  Alaska 
on  November  16,  1874.  Published  in  1875  by  the 
Government  Printing  Office,  the  Report  included 
observations  on  Alaska  in  general  as  well  as  on  the 
Pribilof  Islands.  The  chapters  in  the  Report  about 
the  Pribilofs  were  similar  to  the  material  present¬ 
ed  in  Elliott’s  “unpublished”  monograph,  minus 
the  illustrations.57  For  example,  Chapter  Seven, 

“The  Habits  of  the  Fur  Seal,  Etc.,”  and  Chapter 
Nine,  “Ornithology  of  the  Prybilov  Islands,”  in  the 
Report  are  nearly  verbatim  versions  of  the  mate¬ 
rial  in  Elliott’s  1873  (printed  1874)  monograph,  under  the  headings  “The  Seal-Life  on  the

offending  material  did  not  appear  in  the  1875  report. 

An  ornately  bound  version  of  the  Report  in  the  authors’  possession  has  “Elliott  1874” 
imprinted  on  the  cover’s  spine,  and  “1875”  on  the  internal  cover  page.  It  does  not  in¬ 
clude  either  the  maps  or  the  illustrations  that  Elliott  referred  to  in  his  cover  letter  to  the 
Secretary  of  the  Treasury,58  nor  in  his  letters  to  his  friend  William  H.  Dali. 

As  I  think  it  not  at  all  unlikely  but  that  I  shall  meet  you  in  San  Francisco  next  Spring  I  have 
not  thought  it  worth  while  to  write  much  about  my  work,  etc,  there  is  so  much  to  say  and 
discuss  which  becomes  confusion  worse  confounded  when  put  back  and  forth  upon  paper: 
a  memoir  upon  the  Prybilov  Islands  is  now  passing  through  the  press  illustrated  by  50 
plates,  9  by  6  inches,  royal  quarto,  and  a  detailed  chapter  upon  the  ornithology  by  Elliott 
Coues  based  upon  my  MS.S.  and  material.59 

I  will  have  a  few  copies  ready  for  me  in  fixing  legislation  very  soon  but  Heaven  only  knows 
when  my  plates  will  be  ready  for  the  binder.60 

If  a  version  of  the  1874/1875  Report  was  published  with  Elliott’s  illustrations,  the  au¬ 
thors  did  not  locate  it  during  the  course  of  their  research. 

Elliott  eventually  achieved  his  personal  goal  of  producing  a  natural  history  mono¬ 
graph  about  the  Pribilof  Islands.61  In  1881,  the  Government  Printing  Office  published  A

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Seal  Islands  of  Alaska,  Section  IX  [Monograph 
A]  of  the  Tenth  Census  of  the  United  States.  The 
full  U.S.  Bureau  of  Census,  10th  Census,  was  not 
published  until  1883-1884;  this  apparent  anoma¬ 
ly  between  publication  dates  has  confused  efforts 
to  identify  the  seemingly  disparate  documents 
with  the  same  or  similar  title.63  To  add  to  the  con¬ 
fusion,  a  revised  edition  was  published  in  1882, 
under  the  same  title.64 

Elliott  continued  to  write  for  the  govern¬ 
ment  about  his  observations  on  the  Seal  Islands. 
In  1890,  in  response  to  a  report  submitted  by 
Treasury  Agent  Charles  Goff,  Congress  passed 
an  “order  of  special  act  approved  April  5,  1890” 
to  revisit  the  condition  of  the  fur-seal  fisher¬ 
ies  of  Alaska.65  Goff  had  alleged  that  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company  was  taking  undersized 
seals  and  that  the  fur-seal  herd  was  in  serious  de¬ 
cline.  Elliott  was  charged  by  Congress  with  leading  the  investigation,  and  Charles  Goff 
assisted  him.  In  1896,  Congress  issued  the  Report  Upon  The  Present  Condition  Of  The 
Fur-Seal  Rookeries  Of  The  Pribilov  Islands  Of  Alaska,66  which  included  current  (1890)  il¬ 
lustrations  and  maps  of  the  seal  rookeries.  As  will  be  discussed,  the  report  would  lead  to 
significant  changes  in  wildlife  conservation  efforts  and  in  the  management  of  the  Pribilof 
Islands  regarding  the  fur  seals  and  the  Unaagin  (the  Aleuts  of  the  Pribilof  Islands).  In  1898, 
the  Government  Printing  Office  published  Elliott's  observations  from  1872-1874  and 
from  1890  in  a  compendium  titled  Fur-Seal  Fisheries.  None  of  these  post- 1873  publica¬ 
tions  included  forty-nine  plates  that  were  part  of  his  “unpublished”  monograph.67  These 
fine  examples  of  his  artistry  were  likely  a  portion  of  those  that  Elliott  desired  to  sell  later 
for  $15,000. 

When  Elliott  returned  to  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  1890,  the  North  American  Commercial 
Company  (NACC)  had  replaced  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  (ACC)  as  the  govern¬ 
ment’s  lessee.  Consequently,  the  NACC  and  not  the  ACC  was  subjected  to  Elliott’s  wrath 
over  the  decimation  of  the  seal  herd.  At  this  juncture  Elliott  became  an  untiring  advo¬ 
cate  for  the  preservation  of  the  fur  seal.  However,  the  U.S.  government  and  commercial 
sealing  interests  were  not  yet  ready  for  the  concept  of  wildlife  conservation.  In  1905,  in 
partnership  with  U.S.  Secretary  of  State  John  Hay,  Elliott  drafted  a  treaty  for  managing 
the  seal  herds,  but  politics,  including  the  end  of  Hay’s  tenure,  interfered.  Unwilling  to 
give  up,  yet  frustrated  by  his  inability  to  sway  Congress,  Elliott  sought  the  assistance  of 
other  influential  men  dedicated  to  the  conservation  cause.  He  apparently  also  finally  ac¬ 
knowledged  his  own  boisterous  and  bullying  flaws  and  approached  a  potential  advocate, 
Dr.  William  T.  Hornaday,  Director  of  the  New  York  Zoological  Gardens,  to  speak  on  his 
behalf.  Hornaday  is  credited  with  saving  the  American  bison  from  extinction.  He  was 
also  an  esteemed  member  of  the  board  of  governors  of  the  Camp-Fire  Club  of  America,

an  organization  of  hunters  and  naturalists  (see  Hornaday’s  biography).  Finally  Elliott’s 
conservationist  passion  met  with  some  success. 

In  1911,  Russia,  Japan,  Great  Britain,  and  the  United  States,  the  four  nations  most 
concerned  with  sealing,  signed  a  treaty  outlawing  open-water  sealing  and  accepting 
on-shore  management  of  the  seal  herds  by  the  United  States.  The  Convention  between 
the  United  States  and  Other  Powers  Providing  for  the  Preservation  and  Protection  of  Fur 
Seals,  popularly  known  as  the  Fur-Seal  Treaty  of  1911,  was  the  first  international  treaty  to 
address  wildlife  conservation. 

**** 


To  his  detriment,  Henry  W.  Elliott  initiated  backdoor  attacks  on  friends  and  associ¬ 
ates  who,  in  his  mind,  competed  with  him  as  experts  on  the  subject  of  Alaska  and  more 
specifically  the  Pribilof  Islands  and  fur  seals.  Others  (e.g.,  Victor  B.  Scheffer  et  al.,  Flistory 
of  Scientific  Study,  Lisa  Marie  Morris,  Keeper  of  the  Seal,  and  William  T.  Hornaday,  Thirty 
Years  War  for  Wild  Life:  Gains  and  Losses  in  the  Thankless  Task)  have  touched  upon  the 
negative  aspects  of  Elliott’s  character,  but  a  full  retrospection  awaits  a  seriously  inclined 
student,  who  will  have  much  to  ponder  in  some  of  Elliott’s  more  caustic  writings.  For 
example: 


May  1872 

This  exhibition  of  seal  life  ...  is  really  a  wonderful  sight  and  it  has  thus  far  been  touched  by 
Dali  and  Bryant  in  the  most  superficial  manner,  especially  Dali.  That  which  Capt.  Bryant 
has  written  is  full  of  error  from  beginning  to  end - Allen’s  paper68  is  much  in  error.59

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


May  1873 

Dear  Professor  Baird: ...  To  my  great  surprise,  the  result  of  a  years  observation  and 
survey  among  the  Seals  and  over  the  Island  of  St.  Pauls,  proves  [all  emphasis  by  Elliott] 
conclusively  that  almost  every  statement  made  by  Capt.  Bryant,  Dali,  and  Scammon  on  this 
subject  of  the  Seal  life,  is  not  correct,  and  in  nine  paragraphs  out  of  every  ten  in  Capt  B’s 
“Account  of  the  Habits  etc”  in  the  Bulletin  M.  C.  Zool.  Vol.  II  no.  1  [“On  the  habits  of  the 
Northern  Fur  Seal  (Callorhinus  ursinus  Gray),  with  a  Description  of  the  Pribyloff  Group 
of  Islands.”  Bulletin  of  the  Museum  of  Comparative  Zoology  2  (1):  89-108.  1870],  the  very 
reverse  of  his  statement  exists  and  occurs!  I  have  in  consequence  of  all  this  fanciful  and 
garbled  work  of  Bryant,  Dali  and  Scammon,  given  attention  to  every  point,  no  matter  how 
minute  and  have  spared  no  physical  exertion  or  exposure  in  order  that  I  might  arrive  at  the 
truth  and  have  subsequent  observers  endorse  my  work  and  confirm  my  theories.  0 

Soon  after  Elliott  wrote  to  Baird  criticizing  Dali,  he  wrote  to  Dali  with  an  apparent 
air  of  friendship. 

Dear  Dali: . . .  have  finished  my  Memoir  upon  the  Seal  Life  of  these  Islands. . . .  My  work 
upon  the  Seals  will  be  rough  for  Scammon,  Bryant,  and  others  but  it  cannot  be  helped; 
these  gentlemen  have  been  far  too  superficial  in  their  examinations  and  have  published 
authoritatively  incorrect,  glaringly  so,  statements,  concerning  the  Fur  Seal  of  the  North 
Pacific. ...  I  regret  exceedingly  not  to  have  a  meeting  with  you. . . .  the  heartfelt  hope  that 
you  will  be  successful  both  for  this  season  and  the  next,  I  am  ever  your  friend, 

Henry  W.  Elliott.71 

Later  surveys  and  writings  by  others,  such  as  Joseph  Stanley-Brown,  David  Starr 
Jordan,  and  Victor  B.  Scheffer,  challenged  Elliott’s  own  descriptions  of  the  seal  rookeries 
and  seal  behavior.  Spencer  Baird  wrote  to  William  Dali: 

I  always  knew  that  our  lively  Henry  was  mendacious,  but  did  not  suppose  he  could  manage 
to  get  quite  so  far  from  the  truth  as  in  the  account  of  the  condition  of  your  Collection  at  the 
Smithsonian. ...  It  will  give  me  great  pleasure  to  choke  Henry,  for  telling  such  lies.72 

Nonetheless,  the  aspiring  artist  and  naturalist’s  public  and  congressional  popularity 
rose  during  the  1870s  to  the  early  1880s  as  “Elliott  soon  gained  a  reputation  as  an  author¬ 
ity  not  only  on  the  Alaska  fur  seal  but  on  the  whole  territory.”7,3  His  views  met  with  disfa¬ 
vor  with  some  politicians,  scientists  and  businessmen,  however,  “during  the  last  decade 
of  the  19th  century  and  the  first  two  decades  of  the  20th  century  [when]  the  seal  herd 
was  rapidly  declining  in  number,  .  .  .  Henry  W.  Elliott  was  goading  public  officials  and 
harrying  businessmen,  large  and  small,  who  were  continuing  to  reap  profitable  harvests 
of  sealskins.”74 

Over  the  years  Elliott  lectured  and  published  many  popular  articles  and  books  using 
his  illustrations  to  spark  audience  interest.75  He  collaborated  with  internationally  rec¬ 
ognized  artist  Henry  Sandham  for  an  article  “Leo  Marinus,  The  Sea-King,”  in  Scribner’s 
Monthly  of  October  1878.  His  popular  1886  book  Our  Arctic  Province  finally  gave  Elliott 
an  even  greater  audience  beyond  the  scientific  field.  Articles  and  books  such  as  these, 
along  with  his  art,  propelled  him  into  mainstream  celebrity  as  an  authority  on  Alaska. 

After  his  1890  visit  to  the  Pribilof  Islands,  Elliott  argued  for  the  next  twenty  years 
for  the  cessation  of  the  killing  of  the  northern  fur  seal  on  land  and  at  sea.  Then  in  1907, 
Elliott,  when  asked  if  he  was  paid  for  any  of  his  services,  disclosed  his  clandestine  link  to 
the  ACC  with  the  following  statement  before  the  House  Committee  of  Ways  and  Means: 


236 


“I  was  paid  for  it;  I  was  well  paid  for  it.  [Hearing 
before  Committee  of  Ways  and  Means,  January 
25,  1907,  p.  69,  MS].”76 

Unfortunately  for  Elliott,  his  unsubstantiated 
“scientific  observations,”7’  his  obnoxious  reputa¬ 
tion,  and  his  surreptitious  relationship  with  the 
ACC,  which  had  begun  at  least  as  early  as  1876, 
made  him  an  unwelcome  lobbyist  in  Washington 
political  circles. 

In  1911,  the  House  of  Representatives  held  a 
hearing  led  by  the  Committee  on  Expenditures 
in  the  Department  of  Commerce  and  Labor,  To 
Investigate  the  Fur-Seal  Industry  of  Alaska.  The 
committee’s  report  included  various  sources  de¬ 
scribing  Elliott’s  relationship  with  the  ACC,  and 
the  findings  further  impugned  Elliott’s  reputa¬ 
tion.  Nonetheless,  in  reply  to  the  specific  ques¬ 
tion,  “Were  you  not  an  employee  of  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Co.?”  Henry  Elliott  replied,  “No  sir;  I 
never  was  an  employee  of  the  Alaska  Commercial 
Co.”  8  However,  additional  congressional  com¬ 
mittee  responses  included: 

[Henry  Elliott]  Entered  the  service  of  [the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company]  two  years  after  his 
employment  in  the  Treasury  [i.e.  1876]  as  “counsel 
and  adviser”  and  “under  salary  of  the  company”  (p. 
36,  H.R.  2027,  48th  Cong.,  1st  sess.)79  and  [Elliott] 
“accepted  and  had  at  their  hands  a  retainer  to 
appear  whenever  it  was  necessary,  from  1881  until 
the  date  the  lease  was  lost,  the  12th  of  March, 
1890.”80 

From  this  it  is  evident  that  when  Elliott  visited 
the  islands  in  1876  “on  my  own  responsibility”  he 
was  actually  employed  by  the  Alaska  Commercial 
Co.,  on  whose  vessel,  the  steamship  St.  Paul,  he 
traveled.  He  was  likewise  so  employed  when  the 
monograph  was  written,  although  he  specifically 
denied  the  same  (H.  R.  2027,  p.  36,  above  cited) 
and  also  while  lobbying  for  the  bill  in  1890,  under 
which  he  was  appointed  special  agent  and  of  which 
he  boasted  “in  four  weeks  we  had  that  act.”81 

And 

The  exposure  of  his  connection  with  the 
commercial  interests  which  he  had  previously 
denied,  together  with  his  statements  of  a 
scandalous  nature  affecting  public  men,  most  of 
whom  were  dead,  not  only  resulted  in  his  being

thoroughly  discredited  by  the  committee,  but  disgusted  and  incensed  the  latter  to  such  an 
extent  that  it  prohibited  further  printing  of  the  proceedings  and  practically  suppressed  the 
entire  [record  of  the]  hearings.  (Fur  Trade  Review,  March,  1907,  pp.  190  and  192. )82 

William  T.  Hornaday  later  wrote  in  his  memoir  about  his  experience  with  Elliott. 
Hornaday  seemed  to  forgive  Elliott  for  his  unsavory  behavior,  highlighting  his  dedication 
to  preserving  the  fur  seals’  existence. 

In  the  spring  of  1909,  the  writer  [Hornaday]  came  broad  awake  to  a  compelling  sense  of  his 
duty  to  “do  something”  to  save  the  vanishing  fur  seals. . . . 

It  was  clear  that  nothing  could  be  accomplished  by  more  recriminations,  more  quarreling, 
or  more  fighting.  But  perhaps  something  good  might  be  accomplished  by  outsiders  who 
were  friendly  to  all  parties  concerned!  With  his  matchless  fund  of  fur-seal  knowledge  and 
experience,  Mr.  Elliott  would  make  a  powerful  advisor  and  ally,  but  for  the  sake  of  peace 
and  progress,  it  would  be  cruelly  necessary  for  him  to  remain  in  the  background!  The 
situation  had  become  so  bad  that  any  change  in  it  would  be  for  the  better. 

. . .  Without  a  moment’s  hesitation,  Mr.  Elliott  cheerfully  pledged  himself  to  accept  and 
abide  by  the  harsh  conditions  that  the  hopeless  situation  demanded;  and  he  loyally  kept  his 
word.83 

Hornaday,  who  made  certain  that  Elliott’s  crusade  to  save  the  fur  seal  became  a  last¬ 
ing  legacy,  would  also  write  of  the  blow  to  his  own  reputation  for  taking  on  the  fur-seal 
conservation  fight  with  Elliott: 

the  cost  to  me  in  old  friendships  forever  broken  was  great.  Even  today  [1931]  it  is  painful  to 
contemplate.  I  have  many  ex-friends  who  never  will  forgive  me  for  having  started  that  fur- 
seal  salvage  campaign,  nor  for  its  having  been  successful.84 

Others  wrote: 

In  1911,  Elliott’s  dream  of  saving  the  Alaskan  fur  seal  from  extinction  was  realized  when 
the  four  powers  (Russia,  Japan,  Great  Britain  and  the  United  States)  agreed  to  the  North 
Pacific  Sealing  Convention  [The  Fur-Seal  Treaty].  The  powers  prohibited  all  pelagic  sealing 
in  the  open  ocean,  including  Bering  Sea.  Each  signatory  agreed  to  a  system  of  mutually 
satisfactory  compensation.  A  five-year  land-killing  suspension  for  the  Pribilof  herd  was 
added  by  Congress  due  largely  to  Elliott’s  efforts.85 

Despite  the  1911  Congressional  investigation  which  cast  a  scathing  light  on  Elliott, 
his  persuasive  manner  enabled  him  to  once  again  gain  authority  to  investigate  seal  life  on 
the  Pribilofs  in  1913.  On  June  20,  1913,  the  Committee  on  Expenditures,  chaired  by  John 
H.  Rothermel 

ordered,  That  Henry  W.  Elliott  is  hereby  appointed  as  a  duly  qualified  expert  to  gather 
certain  information  touching  the  conduct  of  public  affairs  on  the  seal  islands  of  Alaska 
as  the  chairman  of  the  committee  shall  require,  and  that  Andrew  F.  Gallagher  is  hereby 
appointed  as  a  duly  qualified  expert  stenographer  and  notary  to  accompany  Mr.  Elliott  and 
record  the  details  of  that  information  as  it  shall  be  developed  under  the  instructions  of  the 
chairman.86 

A.  J.  Gallagher,  a  stenographer  for  the  committee,  accompanied  Elliott  to  take  dicta¬ 
tion.  The  St.  Paul  Agent’s  Log  told  something  of  their  trip  during  the  summer  of  1913: 

At  9  30  a.m.  Henry  W.  Elliott  and  A.  J.  Gallagher  landed  on  the  West  side  in  the 
TAHOMA’s  boat.  Elliott,  whose  connection  with  the  much-vexed  “seal  question,”  is 
well  known,  comes  under  some  sort  of  authority  derived  so  far  as  I  can  gather  from  the 
Congressional  Committee  of  Expenditures  in  the  Department  of  Commerce  to  investigate

seal  life.  Mr.  Gallagher,  a  most  pleasant  gentleman,  is  a  reporter  for  the  Congressional 
committee  and  seems  to  be  here  for  the  purpose  of  taking  notes  as  dictated  by  Mr.  Elliott. 

No  information  as  to  their  coming  has  been  received  by  me  from  the  Department,  and  as 
Mr.  Elliott  did  not  specifically  state  the  cause  and  object  of  his  mission,  I  must  accept  as  a 
fact  his  coming  here  with  proper  authority.  Mr.  Elliott  announced  to  me  vehemently  that 
it  was  his  intention  to  ascertain  the  area  occupied  by  the  [breeding]  seals  at  present  as  a 
means  of  determining  hereafter  their  increase  or  the  contrary;  that,  to  use  his  expression, 
he  will  not  tolerate  the  counting  of  pups  hereafter  by  anyone,  and  that  he  who  does  count 
the  pups  will  be  made  sorry  for  it.  He  stated  that  the  question  of  increase  or  decrease 
of  seals  was  the  only  important  question  to  be  considered,  and  that  mere  numbers,  i.e. 
whether  there  were  one  hundred  thousand  or  whether  there  were  two  hundred  thousand 
in  the  herd  was  not  important  as  compared  with  the  general  question  of  increase  or 
decrease.87 

Agent  and  Caretaker  Walter  Lembkey  soon  exposed,  at  least  to  himself,  Elliott’s  ruse. 

As  a  result  of  the  talk  this  afternoon,  Mr.  Elliott  showed  me  for  the  first  time,  this  evening,  a 
copy  of  his  instructions.  Mr.  Gallagher  stated  to  me  that  they  were  there  under  a  resolution 
of  the  House,  whereas,  upon  reading  the  instructions  I  find  that  no  resolution  of  the  House 
was  passed  authorizing  their  visit,  but  their  instructions  refer  merely  to  a  resolution  of  the 
Committee,  their  instructions  being  signed  by  Mr.  Rothermel  the  chairman.  They  refer 
repeatedly  to  oral  instructions  not  covered  by  the  written  ones.  The  whole  idea  I  can  gather 
from  the  attitude  and  speech  of  the  two  gentlemen  is  that  they  are  wholly  surprised  and 
indignant  over  the  proposition  to  associate  with  anyone  in  an  investigation  of  seal  life  and 
that,  they  would  rather  omit  entirely  further  investigation,  or  carry  it  on  surreptitiously, 
than  to  submit  to  any  joining  of  their  work  with  others  from  the  Department.  I  am  forced 
to  believe  that  Mr.  Elliott’s  endeavor  is  to  establish  a[n]  ex  parte  case;  that  he  is  here  not 
as  a  fair  investigator  but  as  a  special  attorney  acting  solely  in  the  interests  of  clients — [the 
text  from  hereout  until  July  13,  1913,  appears  to  have  been  redacted  as  the  sentence  ends 
without  a  period,  and  the  last  quarter  of  the  log  book  page  is  uncharacteristically  blank].88 

Lembkey’s  Agent’s  Log  continued  recounting  anecdotes  of  Elliott  and  Gallagher’s  ac¬ 
tivities  and  behavior  on  the  islands  until  their  July  30,  1913,  departure  aboard  the  Cutter 
Unalga.  Agent  Lembkey  embarked  with  Elliott  and  neither  man  ever  returned  to  the 
Pribilof  Islands.  Elliott  returned  to  Washington,  D.C.,  to  file  a  lengthy  report  with  nu¬ 
merous  exhibits  that  became  Document  no.  1  in  the  House  Committee  on  Expenditures 
in  the  Department  of  Commerce,  Investigation  of  the  Fur-Seal  Industry  of  Alaska  con¬ 
ducted  on  October  13,  1913,  and  January  17,  1914.  However,  Elliott’s  investigation  was 
clouded  by  the  earlier  findings  against  him  during  the  Hearing  before  the  Committee  of 
Ways  and  Means  January  25,  1907,  and  the  House  Hearings  before  the  Committee  on 
Expenditures  in  the  Department  of  Commerce  and  Labor  during  191 1.89  Consequently, 
Congress  refused  to  pay  Elliott’s  expenses  and  compensation.  The  committee  chairman, 
John  H.  Rothermel,  apparently  solely  authorized  Elliott  and  Gallagher’s  1913  investiga¬ 
tion  and  Rothermel,  “narrowly  escaped  being  expelled  before  the  expiration  of  his  term” 
for  his  complicity  with  Elliott.90 

For  the  rest  of  his  life  Elliott  remained  unrelenting  in  his  efforts  to  save  the  fur  seal, 
but  his  reputation  became  so  tarnished  that  his  good  intentions  received  little  respect. 
William  T.  Hornaday  succinctly  dealt  with  Henry  Wood  Elliott’s  legacy  in  his  book  Thirty 
Years  War  for  Wild  Life:  Gains  and  Losses  in  the  Thankless  Task : 

By  the  year  2000  Mr.  Elliott’s  great-great-grandchildren  may  receive  for  him  “the  thanks  of 
Congress!”  But  I  doubt  it!91

Mr.  Hornaday’s  doubts  notwithstanding,  in  2007  NOAA  recognized  Henry  Wood 
Elliott’s  contribution  to  the  protection  of  the  northern  fur  seal  and  the  North  Pacific  Fur- 
Seal  Treaty  of  1911  as  one  of  the  ten  most  interesting  and  significant  events  in  the  agen¬

same  expedition  (see  Dali’s  biography).  Ennis’  tour  of  duty  took  him  to  Sitka,  where  he 
was  introduced  to  the  Governor  of  Russian  America  and  his  wife,  Prince  and  Madame 
Maksutov.98  By  1870,  Ennis  had  become  a  fur  dealer  in  San  Francisco. 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

William  Ennis  entered  the  employ  of  San  Francisco  trader  Parrott  &  Company  in  1868, 
after  his  return  from  the  Western  Union  Telegraph  Expedition.99  He  served  aboard  the 
schooner  Caldera  as  the  company’s  supercargo  (manager  of  a  vessel’s  cargo),  and  as  agent 
on  St.  George  Island  in  1868.  His  experiences  on  St.  George  were  covered  in  a  memoir 
titled  “Cruise  of  the  Caldera.”100  Excerpts  are  reproduced  here  courtesy  of  the  California 
Historical  Society. 


Cruise  of  the  “Caldera” 

The  objects  of  the  owners  of  this  vessel  wish  for  the  purpose  of  trading  along  the  North 
western  coast  of  our  new  territory  “Alaska”  and  of  taking  such  notes  of  that  country  and  its 
resources  as  would  enable  the  owners  to  determine  whether  by  carrying  on  the  fur  trade 
extensively,  money  could  be  made  in  sufficiently  large  sums  as  to  warrant  the  venture. 

For  this  purpose  the  “Caldera”  a  Schooner  of  one  hundred  and  twenty  three  tons  was 
purchased  and  fitted  up  as  conveniently  as  possible  and  its  command  placed  into  the 
hands  of  one  Capt.  Kensil,  but  this  person  having  resigned  his  position,  the  owners  were 
compelled  to  seek  other  parties  to  carry  out  their  intentions.  After  some  delay  and  looking 
around,  they  were  fortunate  enough  to  secure  the  services  of  Captain  C.P.  Holcomb,  a 
man  eminently  adapted  for  the  command,  who  had  long  been  in  command  of  a  whaling 
vessel  among  the  ice  &  snows  of  an  Artie  [sic]  clime,  and  whose  success  during  his  long 
experience  as  captain  was  ample  proof  that  the  right  man  had  at  last  been  found.  The 
writer  of  this  was  employed  as  super  cargo,  trading  &  business  agent  for  the  owners  and  for 
this  position  he  was  indebted  for  the  knowledge  he  possessed  of  the  Northern  Country,  the 
habits  and  languages  of  the  Russian  and  Esquimaux  having  been  acquired  by  him  while  in 
the  employ  of  the  Russian  Telegraph  Company. 

The  20th  day  of  March  found  our  compliment  [sic]  of  men  complete  and  on  Sunday  the 
22nd  we  bid  adieu  to  San  Francisco  and  stood  down  the  Bay  with  the  following  persons  on 
board:  C.P.  Holcomb,  Commander  of  vessel;  Wm.  H.  Ennis,  Supercargo  &  Agent;  Geo.  R. 
Adams,  Trader;  Osborn  Howes  Jr.,  Clerk;  Tos.  C.  Welden,  1st  mate;  E.  Huckins,  2nd  mate; 
Wm.  Commance,  sailor;  Wm.  Athnidgo,  sailor;  Fred  Peterson,  sailor;  John  Monoque,  sailor; 
Wm.  Holley,  cook. 


“St.  George  Island” 

After  a  short  run  we  sighted  the  smoking  volcano  “Shilmidinsky”  to  the  west  of  “Ounimak” 
and  running  through  the  “pass”  with  a  good  fresh  breeze  we  entered  Behring  Sea  and 
headed  for  the  “Island”  which  we  sighted  April  23rd.  The  morning  of  the  24th  anchored 
off  the  town  and  after  dinner  went  on  shore.  Found  the  Russian  Agent  very  gentlemanly 
and  explained  to  him  that  it  was  my  intention  to  build  houses  &  establish  sealing  stations. 
Gained  some  valuable  information  from  him  regarding  the  time  the  seals  came,  their 
habits,  customs.  He  informed  us  that  100,000  could  be  killed  in  a  season.  I  shall  be  content 
however,  if  we  secure,  10,000  for  our  trouble.  April  25th  landed  our  lumber  &  commenced 
the  building  of  our  house,  found  that  we  were  short  of  timber  necessarily  making  our 
quarters  rather  contracted.  In  the  afternoon  commenced  to  blow  a  fresh  gale  causing  us 
to  stop  landing.  As  there  is  no  harbor  on  the  island,  we  are  continually  annoyed  by  gales 
of  wind  which  cause  us  to  slip  our  anchors  &  run  out  to  sea,  and  when  the  gale  moderated 
to  run  in  &  anchor.  Another  great  difficulty  we  are  obliged  to  contend  against  is  the  serf 


241 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


[sic]  which  rolls  “mountains  high”,  making  it  an  unpleasant  as  well  as  dangerous  business 
to  land  goods.  Friday  May  1st.  Schooner  “Thos.  Woodward”  came  in  &  anchored  and 
finding  she  had  men  to  land  on  the  Island  to  carry  on  the  fishing,  thought  it  judicious  to 
enter  into  an  agreement  to  work  the  island  jointly  instead  of  opposing  one  another.  Drew 
up  a  contract  obliging  each  party  to  land  $5000  worth  of  goods  and  at  the  end  of  the  season 
to  equally  divide  the  skins,  said  contract  to  hold  good  for  the  period  of  three  years.  The 
"Woodward”  having  a  large  quantity  of  lumber  on  board,  landed  a  sufficient  number  of 
boards  &  shingles  to  erect  a  large  and  commodious  House.  While  engaged  in  this  work  the 
Steamer  “Fideliter”  belonging  to  “Hutchins  Khole  [sic]  &  Co”  arrived  and  took  possession 
of  their  houses  &  goods  on  the  Island  making  themselves  a  formidable  opposition  to  our 
parties.  After  much  wrangling  &  quarrelling  we  compromised  the  matter  by  entering 
into  a  contract  with  them  to  monopolize  the  entire  Island  between  us  &  maintain  it  by 
force  should  force  be  required.  At  last  after  much  difficulty  &  worry,  I  managed  to  settle 
everything  satisfactory  and  left  as  my  agents  on  the  Island  Messrs  Adams  and  Howes  with 
definite  instructions  for  their  guidance.  Before  leaving  the  subject  of  St.  George  Island  I 
must  not  forget  to  state  that  a  terrific  gale  of  wind  sprang  up  while  laying  at  anchor  and  we 
narrowly  escaped  shipwreck  on  the  brakers!  [sic]  At  this  time  I  discovered  that  my  goods 
and  vessel  were  in  danger  of  confiscation  by  the  Government  on  account  of  not  clearing 
properly  for  trading  on  the  American  shores  of  "Alaska.”  This  I  was  not  aware  of,  not  having 
seen  any  publicity  of  the  order.101 

Ennis’  account  related  to  fur-trading  activities  on  St.  George  Island  in  1868.  He  appar¬ 
ently  elected  not  to  mention  either  Messrs.  Parrott  &  Company  or  the  year  1868,  but  he 
did  refer  to  the  schooner  Caldera  rather  than  to  a  fictional  schooner  christened  Katie,  as 
another  writer  about  the  journey  had  done.  Osborne  Howes  Jr.  (see  Howes’  biography  as 
well  as  paragraph  three  of  the  reproduced  narrative  below)  was  the  author  of  an  unsigned 
1872  New  York  Times  article,  “An  Adventure  in  Behring  Sea,”  about  his  excursion  to  St. 
George  Island  in  1868  aboard  the  schooner  Katie.  A  search  of  the  Port  of  San  Francisco 
records  by  the  present  authors  verified  that  the  Caldera,  and  not  the  Katie,  entered  the 
Port  at  the  time  in  question,  suggesting  that  Katie  is  a  pseudonym  for  the  Caldera  in  the 
New  York  Times  piece. 

According  to  historian  Harold  Taggart,  after  returning  from  the  Pribilof  Islands  and 
marrying  Susan  Coates,  William  Ennis  soon  set  sail  on  an  adventure  to  Norton  Sound  for 
Parrott  &  Co.  Thereafter,  William  Ennis  seems  to  have  drifted  from  recorded  history.102

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Melville  C.  Erskine  was  one  of  the  first  American  sealers  to  go  to  the  Pribilof  Islands.  He 
continued  to  visit  the  Seal  Islands  each  year  for  twenty-four  years  as  an  employee  of  the 
Alaska  Commercial  Company.  He  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  before  Notary 
Public  Clement  Bennett  in  San  Francisco,  California,  on  April  6,  1892. 

I  am  55  years  of  age.  I  reside  in  San  Francisco.  I  am  a  master  mariner  by  occupation.  I  have 
been  going  to  the  Bering  Sea  twenty-four  years.  I  went  first  to  the  seal  islands  in  April  1868, 
and  have  been  going  there  ever  since,  visiting  the  islands  every  year  until  1890. 1  have  been 
cruising  along  the  coast  from  here  to  the  Aleutian  Islands,  and  have  had  an  opportunity 
of  ascertaining  the  habits  of  the  seals.  A  year  ago  last  March  I  saw  a  herd  of  seals  of  from 
500  to  600  just  above  Cape  Mendocino  [California].  I  have  also  often  met  large  numbers 
scattered  along  the  coast  of  Cape  Flattery  [Washington],  generally  from  10  to  20  miles 
offshore. ...  I  have  been  for  the  past  twenty-four  years  and  am  now  employed  by  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company,  the  former  lessees  of  the  seal  islands.104

31  Elliott’s  age  at  the  time  he  began  his  position  in  the  Smithsonian  varies  among  authors,  e.g.  Gay, 
“Henry  W.  Elliott,”  211,  stated  he  was  fifteen,  whereas  Butler,  who  interviewed  family  members  for 
The  Lakewood  Story,  97,  suggested  that  he  was  sixteen  because  he  didn’t  begin  sketching  until  that 
age,  and  as  a  reward  for  his  artistry  his  father  introduced  him  to  prominent  men  in  Washington,

Haven  and  London:  Yale  University  Press,  1965),  50,  stated,  “A  Brooklyn  woman  wrote  to  the 
Smithsonian  to  inquire  whether  Elliott  was  entitled  to  the  appellation  ‘professor.’  Baird  said  no, 
but  mentioned  that  Elliott  had  had  ‘large  experience’  in  exploring  the  Northwest.  Sherwood  cited 
Baird  to  Mrs.  Harriet  M.  Sutter,  Nov.  20,  1878,  SIA,  stating  “In  fact,  neither  Dali  nor  Elliott  was  on 
the  Smithsonian  payroll.”

remainder  of  the  summer”  (U.S.  Congress,  House,  Appendix  A  to  Hearings  Before  the  Committee

has  put  in  her  appearance  today  for  the  last  time  this  year  and  on  her  I  am  to  go  down  with  my

44  Elliott’s  artworks  eventually  totaled  in  the  hundreds.  The  Carnegie  Museum  of  Natural  History 
acquired  fifty  of  Elliott’s  works.  In  2008,  Curator-in-Charge  Dr.  David  R.  Watters,  Section  of 
Anthropology,  wrote  in  his  unpublished  “Extracts  from  documents  concerning  the  Elliott  water- 
colors  housed  in  the  Carnegie  Museum  of  Natural  History,  Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania”  how  Elliott’s 
watercolors  came  into  the  Museum’s  possession.  The  following  excerpt  was  taken  from  "Monthly 
Reports  of  the  Director  [to  the  Museum  Committee],  in  vol.  2,  June  30,  1905-Oct.  17,  1910,  and

Report  of  August  31,  1907: 

I  am  in  receipt  of  a  letter  from  Mr.  Henry  W.  Elliott  in  which  he  informs  me  that  he  has  transferred 
his  interest  in  the  collection  of  fifty  water  color  sketches  of  the  seal  herds  of  Alaska,  now  on  deposit 
with  us,  to  Mr.  M.  R.  Hemler  of  Cleveland,  Ohio,  and  requesting  me  to  hold  the  same  subject  to  his 
order,  and  in  the  event  of  the  purchase  of  this  collection  by  the  Trustees  of  the  Carnegie  Institute 
that  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  be  paid  to  him  to  the  extent  of  Mr.  Elliott’s  indebtedness  to  Mr. 

Hemler.  I  am  also  in  receipt  of  a  letter  from  the  United  Banking  &  Savings  Co.  of  Cleveland,  Ohio, 


245 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


informing  me  of  the  assignment  of  Mr.  Elliott’s  interest  in  the  drawings  alluded  to  and  stating  that 
the  indebtedness  for  which  this  assignment  was  made  is  evidenced  by  notes  of  Professor  Elliott  as 
follows:  $1081.91  and  interest  from  November  17,  1906;  $399.16  and  interest  from  August  20,  1907. 

This  transaction  relates  to  a  matter  concerning  which  I  have  already  spoken  to  you  several  times 
privately.  I  think  the  Committee  ought  to  look  into  this  matter  of  the  drawings,  and  it  is  possible 
that  it  would  be  advisable  for  us  to  purchase  them  if  satisfactory  arrangements  could  be  made.  I 
have  made  some  inquiries  quite  recently  of  Mr.  W.  H.  Dali  of  Washington,  and  of  other  gentlemen. 

They  speak  very  highly  of  the  drawings,  but  none  of  them  expressed  himself  to  me  as  inclined 
to  recommend  the  purchase  at  the  price  which  Mr.  Elliott  has  demanded  for  them,  to  wit,  five 
thousand  dollars.  Of  course  we  all  know  that  the  seal  herd  has  disappeared  and  in  two  or  three  years 
from  now  will  be  absolutely  extinct,  when  these  drawings,  which  represent  the  herd  at  the  height  of 
its  most  prosperous  period  of  existence,  will  be  of  very  great  value  and  interest. 

More  than  ten  years  elapsed  before  the  Carnegie  Museum  secured  the  collection,  as  suggested  in 
the  following  letter  from  a  Mr.  Mahlon  R.  Hemler  (b.  Feb.  1845,  PA;  d.  May  20,  1929,  Cleveland, 
OH,  U.S.  Census,  1900,  Cleveland),  who  was  a  grocer  on  Franklin  Ave,  Cleveland,  OH,  and  a  one¬ 
time  neighbor  of  Mr.  Elliott’s  in  the  Cleveland,  OH  area: 

July  16,  1918 

I,  M.  R.  Hemler  state  that  I  received  these  pictures  as  collateral  for  approximately  $1500.00,  owed 
me  by  W.  [sic]  W.  Elliott,  in  A.D.  1907,  and  that  I  have  received  no  interest  on  the  debt  for  eleven 
years.  I  had  hoped  to  get  $2000.00,  but  will  accept  $1200.00,  provided  a  payment  of  $500.00  is  made 
in  August,  1918,  the  balance  within  a  year  from  date  of  first  payment.

46  The  records  examined  are  not  clear  on  this  assertion  by  Elliott  that  he  was  sent  to  participate  in 
any  “investigations.”  Rather  the  record  shows  that  he  had  his  own  agenda  about  the  natural  history 
of  the  islands,  and  not  particularly  the  seals. 

47  In  a  letter  to  William  H.  Dali,  Elliott  explicitly  stated  he  is  expected  to  remain  on  the  islands  until 
Oct.  1873.  Letter  from  Henry  W.  Elliott  to  William  H.  Dali,  Apr.  22,  1872,  SIA,  RU  7073,  box  10,

1873.

submitted  his  report  in  1873  as  he  claimed. 

53  Ibid.,  28. 

54  In  the  paragraph  previous  to  this  quote  from  his  report  Elliott  had  written:  “The  only  point  upon 
which  I  would  dwell  with  reference  to  the  inhabitants  of  the  Prybilov  Islands  is,  that  they  are  not 
Indians  in  our  acceptation  of  the  term,  not  any  more  so  than  are  the  lower  classes  who  live  in  so 
much  squalor  and  ignorance  in  all  our  great  cities  and  industrial  centers.”  In  his  next  paragraph, 
Elliott  may  actually  have  been  referring  back  to  “the  lower  classes,”  in  the  previous  paragraph,  but 
it  may  not  have  read  that  way  to  the  Treasury  Secretary. 

55  Scheffer,  They  Stopped  the  Press  on  His  Book,  27,  cited  a  quote  by  Elliott:  “[a]  report  of  mine  made 
upon  the  Pribylov  islands  in  September,  1873,  and  . . .  printed  by  the  Treasury  Department  during 
my  absence  in  Alaska.  Owing  to  causes  of  which  I  have  necessarily  no  personal  knowledge,  only 
75  copies  of  this  report  were  struck  off.” 

56  In  a  letter  from  Treasury  Secretary  B.  H.  Bristow  to  Chairman,  Committee  on  Territories,  Senator 
P.  W.  Hitchcock,  Bristow  stated,  “A  limited  number  of  a  similar  report  by  Mr.  Elliott  in  1873, 

was  printed  with  illustrations  but  only  one  copy  thereof  remains  within  files  of  the  Department.”

of  the  University  of  Washington,  Seattle,  and  other  locations. 

57  Several  of  the  illustrations  in  Elliott’s  1873  (printed  1874)  monograph  Report  of  the  Prybilov

61  Several  years  ago,  the  authors  found  several  printed  copies  of  two  versions  of  Elliott’s  monograph 
at  a  Juneau,  Alaska,  antiquarian  bookshop.  The  two  soft-cover  versions  ( Report  on  the  Seal  Islands 
of  Alaska  [1880]  and  The  History  and  Present  Condition  of  the  Fishery  Industries:  The  Seal  Islands 
of  Alaska  (1881)  have  caused  some  confusion  over  the  years  as  to  the  number  of  Elliott’s  published 
works.  Version  one  is  undated  although  it  includes  a  transmittal  letter  from  Elliott  to  the  super¬ 
intendent  of  the  Tenth  Census,  Francis  A.  Walker,  with  a  date  of  Mar.  31,  1880.  In  this  “1880” 
printing,  the  foldout  maps  of  the  two  major  Pribilof  Islands  are  in  monochrome  and  are  included 
at  the  end  of  the  book.  Version  two  is  dated  1881  and  includes  colored  maps  as  frontispieces.  The 
1881  version  was  also  reprinted  in  1882  as  A  Monograph  of  the  Seal-Islands  of  Alaska,  by  Henry 
W.  Elliott,  with  additions  from  the  “Report  on  the  Fishery  Industries  of  the  Tenth  Census”  (U.S. 
Commission  of  Fish  and  Fisheries,  176-page  Special  Bulletin).  Limestone  Press  (1976)  reprinted 
the  1881  version,  but  not  as  an  exact  copy  of  either  the  1880  or  1881  versions  in  our  posses¬ 
sion.  For  example,  the  foldout  maps  of  the  two  islands  are  placed  as  front  and  back  end-papers, 
respectively.  Version  two  (1881)  and  the  reprinted  version  (1976)  have  the  same  outer  cover 
clearly  marked  with  the  publication  date  of  1881,  and  included  within  the  title  is  Tenth  Census  of 
the  United  States/The  History  and  Present  Condition  of  the  Fishery  Industries/The  Seal  Islands  of 
Alaska,  by  Henry  W.  Elliott;  the  reprinted  version  lacks  the  artistic  bordering  around  the  title.  The 
second  title  pages  of  the  1881  and  1976  (reprint)  versions  both  read  “Section  IX  [Monograph  A] 

A  Monograph  of  the  Pribylov  Group,  Or  The  Seal-Islands  of  Alaska  by  Henry  W.  Elliott.”  All  three 
versions  have  176  pages  of  narrative.  We  presume  the  first  version  (1880)  was  a  proof. 

62  The  1881  version  of  A  Monograph  of  the  Pribylov  Group,  or  Seal  Islands  of  Alaska  (Kingston,  ON: 
Limestone  Press)  was  republished  in  1976  (ISBN  0-919642-72-1).  The  second  title  page  reads 
“Section  IX  [Monograph  A],  A  Monograph  of  the  Pribylov  Group  or  the  Seal-Islands  of  Alaska  by 
Henry  W.  Elliott,  with  Twenty-Nine  Plates,  Two  Maps,  and  Twelve  Sketch-Maps  of  the  Islands 
and  the  Rookeries  by  the  Author.” 

63  The  1880  “Tenth  Census”  was  prepared  by  Ivan  Petroff,  who  at  one  time,  according  to  Orth, 
Dictionary  of  Alaska  Place  Names,  Geological  Survey  Paper  567  (Washington,  DC:  GPO,  1967), 
26,  was  employed  to  gather  resources  and  translate  Russian  text  for  use  in  H.  H.  Bancroft’s  1886 
History  of  Alaska,  1730-1885.  (San  Francisco:  A.  L.  Bancroft,  1886.)  Orth  (1079,  under  “Petroff”) 
also  stated  that  a  preliminary  86-page  version  of  the  1880  census  was  published  in  1881,  but  the 
final  document  was  not  published  until  1884. 

64  Cf.  Orth,  Dictionary,  12;  in  his  Selected  Bibliography  (1082)  he  cites  the  Tenth  Census  as  “U.  S. 
Bureau  of  the  Census,  1884,  Tenth  Census  of  Alaska:  see  bibliography  Petroff,  1884.”  The  Census 
Office  became  the  Bureau  of  the  Census  in  1903.  The  complexity  of  the  various  republished  titles 
and  dates  of  Elliott’s  government  publications  may  have  resulted  in  some  confusion  or  errors.

67  Several  of  the  illustrations  in  the  1882  version  had  captions  similar  to  those  of  the  1873  original, 
but  the  illustrations  were  not  the  same.  For  example,  plates  “unnumbered”  (1873),  IX  (1882),  and 
45  (1890),  captioned  “The  North  Shore  of  St.  Paul’s  Island,”  all  seemingly  illustrated  from  the  same 
perspective  at  North  Rookery,  are  different  artistic  interpretations. 

68  Joel  Asaph  Allen  (1838-1921)  was  one  of  America’s  leading  naturalists  during  the  late  19th  and 
early  20th  centuries.  Which  of  Allen’s  papers  Elliott  was  referring  to  is  uncertain.

73  Gay,  Henry  W.  Elliott,  213.  Though  Elliott  claimed  great  knowledge  of  the  Territory  of  Alaska  and 
was  more  knowledgeable  than  most  in  political  circles,  he  was  not  well  traveled  in  it.  Once  chal¬ 
lenged  to  answer  the  question  of  his  expertise  on  the  Territory  he  offered:  “I  may  say  at  the  outset, 
that  while  I  concede  for  the  sake  of  argument  that  Mr.  Dali  ‘has  seen  more  of  the  country  than 
any  other  individual,’  I  am  not  willing  to  grant  the  plain  inference  that  he  has  studied  that  which

77  Elliott’s  calculation  of  the  1872-73  seal  herd  put  the  population  over  4.7  million.  This  estimate 
proved  to  be  a  gross  miscalculation,  as  later  investigators  placed  it  closer  to  2.5  million.  In  1890 
Elliott  argued  that  the  precipitous  decline  of  the  seal  herd  was  due  to  land  killing  and  not  to  pe¬ 
lagic  sealing — again  a  gross  error.  His  arguments  that  overdriving  male  seals  “so  injured  the  testes 
of  these  animals  as  to  make  them  impotent”  proved  wrong.  The  government’s  case  against  Elliott 
is  presented  in  U.S.  Congress,  House,  Appendix  A,  1153-62.  Also  see  Victor  B.  Scheffer,  Clifford

Agent  and  Caretaker,  Department  of  Commerce,  St.  Paul  Island,  1914-1918 
Genealogy 

Henry  Clifford  Fassett  was  popularly  known  as  “Harry.”  Henry  Fassett  was  born  May 
9,  1870,  to  Harris  Harding  Fassett  and  Emma  Louise  (Neal)  Fassett  at  Pacheco,  Contra 
Costa  County,  California.  The  Fassett  family  was  descended  from  Captain  John  Fassett 
(1743-1803),  one  of  Ethan  Allen’s  Green  Mountain  Boys  in  Vermont,  and  Harry  Fassett 
(1794-1872),  one  of  the  first  physicians  in  Johnstown,  Licking  County,  Ohio.  Harry  C. 
Fassett  married  Myra  Beck  (1884-1948)  of  Mississippi  in  1918  while  he  was  on  leave 
from  the  Pribilof  Islands;  they  had  no  children.  Harry  Fassett  died  December  9,  1953. 1

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Biographical  Sketch 

In  1854,  Harris  Harding  Fassett  left  Ohio  for  the 
gold  fields  of  California  to  join  his  brother  and 
sister,  Chitt  and  Ann.  The  Fassett  family  became 
shopkeepers  in  Pacheco,  and  eventually  in  San 
Francisco.2  In  1889,  Harris’  son,  Harry  Clifford 
Fassett,  went  to  work  for  Huntington  Hopkins 
and  Company  of  San  Francisco,  before  signing  on 
at  age  nineteen  as  clerk  stenographer  on  the  U.S. 
Fish  Commission’s  steamer  Albatross.  As  stenog¬ 
rapher,  Fassett  kept  the  vessel’s  scientific  records, 
which  he  did  “until  the  close  of  its  Philippine 
Expedition  in  1910.  He  took  part  in  almost  con¬ 
tinuous  investigations,  including  expeditions  to 
Hawaii,  Panama,  the  South  Seas  (1899),  Japan, 
and  Alaska  (1897)  ”3  The  1900  U.S.  Census  listed 
him  as  clerk  on  the  Albatross,  off  the  coast  of 
Japan.  Geographer  Donald  Orth  credited  Fassett 
with  studies  aboard  the  Albatross  in  southeast 
Alaska  during  1900-1901.4  Orth  further  credited 
Fassett  with  drafting  several  maps  of  the  Alaskan  coast,  and  with  two  Alaska  geographical 
names,  Fassett  Glacier  and  Fassett  Point.  Sharon  Landwehr  of  the  California  Academy  of 
Sciences  summarized  Harry  Fassett ’s  science  career: 

A  resident  of  San  Francisco  since  1934  and  a  member  of  the  California  Academy  of 
Sciences  since  1945,  Harry  Fassett  was  particularly  interested  in  the  Academy’s  Library  and 
donated  all  of  his  books  over  a  period  of  years,  along  with  extensive  Reports  and  Bulletins 
of  the  U.S.  Fish  Commission,  Department  of  Commerce,  Department  of  Agriculture,  Coast 
Geodetic  Survey  and  more.  At  the  time  of  his  death  on  December  9,  1953,  in  San  Francisco, 

Fassett  was  the  last  surviving  member  of  the  team  that  made  the  steamer  Albatross  famous 
as  an  oceanographic  institution.5 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Harry  Fassett  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  during  the  spring  of  1914,  as  agent  and  care¬ 
taker.  He  held  that  position  until  May  21,  1919,  when  he  departed  St.  Paul  on  the  steamer 
Saturn.  After  a  temporary  leave  beginning  in  December  1917,  Harry  returned  on  May  8, 
1918,  with  his  wife,  Myra  B.  Fassett,  who  was  employed  as  a  temporary  assistant  on  the 
island  that  year.6 

One  of  the  most  significant  changes  during  Harry  Fassett’s  tenure  on  the  Pribilof 
Islands  was  the  standardization  of  spellings  of  surnames  and  given  names  among  the 
Native  population.  The  spellings  administered  by  Fassett  are  still  being  used  today.7 

Notwithstanding  the  documented  fact  that  name  spellings  were  standardized  in 
1916,  a  legend  persists  today  (2008)  that  the  government  and/or  the  mail  carrier  (Reeve 
Aleutian  Airways)  modified  the  surnames  of  families  on  the  islands  to  improve  mail  ser¬ 
vice.  For  example,  two  individuals  with  the  same  given  and  family  name,  such  as  John 


Harry  Clifford  Fassett.  (Photo:  Carl

Merculieff,  at  times  resided  on  each  island.  To  improve  mail  delivery,  either  the  post 
office  or  the  mail  carrier  modified  the  surname  of  the  entire  “Merculieff”  family  to  end 
in  a  single  f  (Merculief)  on  one  island  while  retaining  the  “ff”  on  the  other  island.  If 
this  legendary  modification  in  spelling  did  occur,  the  authors  did  not  find  any  supporting 
documentation.8 


Fish,  Charles  Pattison  (1842-1879) 

Meteorologist,  U.S.  Army  Signal  Corps,  Weather  Service,  St.  Paul  Island,  1872-1876 
Genealogy 

Charles  Pattison  Fish  was  born  September  11,  1842,  in  Michigan,  to  physician  David 
Dickinson  (Dixon)  Fish  (1814-1886)  and  Elizabeth  (Pattison)  Fish.  Charles  Fish  had 
one  brother,  Everett  W.  Fish,  and  four  sisters:  Francis  E.,  Ella  S.,  Anna  E.,  and  Harriet  B. 
Fish.  Charles  married  January  15,  1871,  in  the  London  district  of  Marylebone,  Middlesex 
County,  England,  to  Emily  Eleanor  Herbert  Clarke,  daughter  of  Robert  Herbert  Clarke. 
Emily  was  born  circa  1850,  in  St.  Margaret  Parish,  Kings  Lynn  Borough,  Norfolk  County, 
England.  Emily  Fish  died  in  Washington,  D.C.,  April  20, 1917.  Charles  Fish  died  September 
26,  1879,  at  New  York  City.9 

Biographical  Sketch 

In  his  youth,  Charles  and  his  brother,  Everett  W.  Fish,  lived  with  their  grandparents  Dr. 
Samuel  Warren  Pattison  and  Phoebe  (Atwood)  Pattison  in  Ypsilanti,  Washtenaw  County, 
Michigan.  Dr.  Pattison  was  one  of  the  early  physicians  to  practice  in  Michigan,  begin¬ 
ning  in  1836  at  Fenton  and  Owosso  for  thirty-six  years,  followed  by  thirty-one  years  in 
Ypsilanti,  where  he  died  October  23,  1881,  at  the  age  of  eighty-four.10  The  grandfather’s 
choice  of  profession  influenced  Fish’s  father,  David,  as  well  as  his  brother,  Everett,  who 
after  studying  at  the  University  of  Michigan  became  a  professor  of  medicine,  as  well  as  a 
journalist.  Charles  did  not  follow  the  family  tradition  of  practicing  medicine  but  rather 
followed  a  military  career  in  the  U.S.  Army.  At  the  age  of  eighteen,  he  enlisted  as  a  private 
with  the  Michigan  troops  of  St.  Clair  County.  In  the  Civil  War  he  served  in  Company  H, 
Michigan  3rd  Cavalry  Regiment.  He  was  promoted  to  sergeant  and  had  served  his  last 
two  years  as  hospital  steward  when  he  mustered  out  in  1866  at  San  Antonio,  Texas.11 

After  the  war,  Fish  participated  in  commercial  ventures  in  the  south  and  at  west¬ 
ern  forts.  These  endeavors  eventually  brought  him  to  London,  England,  where  he  met 
and  married  his  wife,  Emily.  Charles  and  Emily  Fish  resided  in  Battersea,  Wandsworth 
District,  County  Surrey,  England,  where  Fish  was  listed  as  an  American  merchant  in  the 
1871  census.  Charles  and  Emily  arrived  at  New  York  from  London  on  November  15, 1871. 
On  February  8,  1872,  Fish  re-entered  military  service  as  a  sergeant  in  order  to  participate 
in  the  newly  formed  weather  unit  within  the  U.S.  Army  Signal  Service.12  Fish  served  five 
years  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  before  resigning  from  military  service  with  an  honorable  dis¬ 
charge  on  September  12,  1876.  He  turned  his  attention  to  writing  and  was  identified  as  a 


253 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


New  York  reporter  upon  his  death  in  1879.  On  careful  observation  one  can  see  that  the 
copy  of  the  marriage  certificate  submitted  by  Emily  Fish  in  her  1891  application  for  Civil 
War  pension  benefits  had  been  altered  to  read  1873  as  the  year  of  marriage,  rather  than 
the  year  1871  as  recorded  in  the  England  Marriage  Register  of  that  year.  The  numeral  one 
(1)  is  visible  behind  the  smudged  numeral  three  (3)  in  two  places  where  it  appears  on  the 
certificate.  In  her  declaration  for  widow’s  pension  application,  Emily  entered  1873  as  the 
year  of  marriage.  The  question  arises  as  to  the  reason  for  tampering  with  the  submitted 
document.  Why  was  it  so  important  to  change  the  year  of  their  marriage  and  run  the  risk 
of  criminal  prosecution?  We  assume  the  answer  lies  in  Fish’s  1872  application  for  service 
into  the  Signal  Corps’  Weather  Service  training  program.  At  that  time  during  the  infancy 
of  the  program,  “only  unmarried  men  between  the  ages  of  twenty-one  and  forty  were 
eligible.”13  When  Fish  re-enlisted  in  the  Army  on  February  8,  1872,  he  listed  himself  as  a 
single  man  in  order  to  meet  that  requirement.14 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

On  June  21,  1860,  President  James  Buchanan  created  the  U.S.  Army  Signal  Corps  with  his 
signing  of  the  Army  appropriations  bill  for  fiscal  year  1861. 15  During  its  formative  years 
the  U.S.  Army  Signal  Corps  was  often  called  the  Signal  Service.16 

Charles  Fish  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  on  August  14,  1872,  as  a  member  of  the  U.S. 
Army  Signal  Service.  He  was  the  first  to  establish  a  meteorological  station  on  the  Pribilof 
Islands.  Emily  Fish  accompanied  her  husband  to  St.  Paul  Island  and  served  as  a  school 
teacher.17 

Fish  was  required  to  submit  weekly  reports  of  the  daily  meteorological  records  to  the 
Office  of  the  Chief  Signal  Officer.  Focation  was  noted  as  latitude  57°  T  9"  N,  longitude 
170°  17'  52"  W.  At  9  a.m.  each  day,  he  recorded  the  wind  direction  and  velocity,  cloudi¬ 
ness,  weather  condition,  ocean  swell,  thermometer  reading,  barometer  reading,  snow 
or  rain,  and  any  significant  remarks.  The  meteorological  information  he  obtained  was 
passed  daily  to  the  government  agents  on  St.  Paul;  they  in  turn  recorded  it  as  the  first  item 
in  the  Agent’s  Log.  In  Henry  W.  Elliott’s  printed  but  unpublished  1873  report  (see  Elliott 
biography)  there  is  a  tribute  to  Charles  Fish’s  meteorological  work  on  St.  Paul  Island. 
(Interestingly,  Fish  would  later  not  be  so  kind  to  Elliott.) 

The  Climatology  of  the  Prybilov  Islands 

Mr.  Chas.  P.  Fish  has  made  an  exceedingly  exhaustive  and  full  report  to  the  Chief  Signal- 
Officer  of  the  Army,  at  Washington,  and  which  will  be  published  soon.  It  is  so  complete 
that  I  shall  refer  all  to  it  who  may  wish  to  watch  the  weather  closely  through  a  year,  or 
years,  on  the  Seal  Islands,  and  simply  note  here  that  the  winter  of  1872-73  was  one  of 
great  severity,  according  to  the  natives,  much  more  so  than  usual,  it  being  generally  very 
much  warmer;  but,  cold  as  it  was,  the  lowest  marking  by  the  thermometer  was  12°  below 
zero,  and  that  for  a  few  hours  only  during  one  day  in  February,  while  the  mean  of  the 
month  was  but  18°  above.  The  coldest  month,  March,  gave  a  mean  of  12°  above,  while  the 
usual  winters  have  a  mean  of  only  22°  or  26°;  but  the  high  north  winds,  blowing  more  than 
three-fourths  of  the  time,  make  all  out-door  exercise  impracticable;  for  instance,  one  day  in 
March,  1873,  it  blew  at  the  rate  of  eighty-eight  miles  per  hour  with  as  low  a  temperature  as 
minus  4°!  With  a  wind  traveling  only  twenty-four  or  twenty-five  miles  an  hour,  at  a  much

higher  temperature,  as  at  15°  or  16°  above,  it  is  necessary  to  be  most  thoroughly  wrapped 
up  to  guard  against  freezing,  if  any  journey  is  to  be  made  over  the  Islands. 

There  are  but  two  seasons,  winter  and  summer.  To  the  former  belong  November, 

December,  January,  February,  March,  and  April,  with  a  mean  of  20°to  28°,  while  the 
transition  to  summer  is  but  a  slight  elevation  in  temperature,  only  15°  to  20°,  and  of  the 
summer  months,  July  is  the  warmest,  with  a  mean  of  48°  or  50°. 

It  is  astonishing  how  rapidly  snow  melts  here  at  a  single  degree  above  freezing,  and  after 
several  consecutive  days  at  34°  and  36°,  grass  begins  to  grow,  even  if  it  be  under  melting 
drifts  and  the  frost  is  many  feet  deep  in  the  ground.  The  report  of  Mr.  C.P.  Fish,  Signal 
Service,  United  States  Army,  cannot  fail  to  be  of  great  interest  to  meteorologists  who 
will  find  subjects  for  much  thought  and  reflection  in  its  elaborate  details;  and  with  the 
permission  of  the  Chief  Signal  Officer,  I  compiled  the  following  table  from  the  reports  of 
his  office,  showing  the  range  of  barometer,  thermometer,  wind,  cloudiness,  &c.,  during  a 
severe  winter  on  St.  Paul’s  [sic]  Island.18 

Charles  Fish  resigned  from  the  Signal  Service  in  September  1876  and  left  St.  Paul 
Island  (see  Edward  Gill  biography — Gill  replaced  Fish  in  1876).  Several  months  after 
Fish  returned  to  Washington,  D.C.,  he  submitted  a  fourteen-page  letter  to  Secretary 
of  the  Treasury  Lot  M.  Morrill  to  introduce  the  one-hundred-page  Report  of  General 
Government  Charges  on  past  and  present  management  on  the  Fur  Seal  Islands,  containing 
suggestions  as  to  the  rectification  of  all  and  thereon  existing.  No  specifications  appended 
or  enclosed  although  at  hand.1"  The  report  was  full  of  accusations  aimed  at  Agent  Bryant, 
Agent  Falconer,  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  (ACC)  agents,  and  Special  Agent 
Henry  W.  Elliott.  Fish  objected  to  how  the  seal  industry  was  being  managed,  objected  to 
statements  within  the  agents’  yearly  reports  that  he  considered  false,  and  wrote  of  many 
reasons  why  he  thought  new  management  was  needed.  He  wanted  to  see  a  permanent 
meteorological  observatory  on  St.  Paul  Island  with  Fish  as  manager.  The  subject  of  educa¬ 
tion  of  the  Aleuts  was  mentioned  often  within  the  report  and  the  letter.  Where  his  wife 
Emily  had  been  the  teacher  on  St.  Paul  Island,  he  felt  her  progress  with  teaching  the  chil¬ 
dren  to  read,  write,  and  speak  English  was  not  emphasized  enough  by  both  the  company 
and  government  agents  as  an  important  achievement.  The  Fish  letter  and  report  of  com¬ 
plaints  did  not  result  in  any  special  congressional  committee  investigation  or  changes  in 
management  or  administration. 

President  Rutherford  B.  Hayes  took  office  March  5,  1877,  and  John  Sherman  was 
appointed  as  the  new  Secretary  of  the  Treasury.  In  vain  attempts  to  return  to  St.  Paul 
Island,  Fish  wrote  more  letters  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  both  to  chastise  the  ACC 
and  to  gain  favor  for  an  appointment  as  ‘weatherman’  of  the  Pribilof  Islands.  The  first 
letter  of  March  11, 1877,  addressed  invoices  issued  by  the  ACC.  The  letter  included  a  long 
list  of  items  purchased  by  Fish,  what  Fish  was  charged,  and  what  Fish  thought  the  items 
were  worth.  Fish  also  included  a  general  statement  outlining  his  work  of  the  day  on  St. 
Paul  Island:  “practical  predictions  of  weather  including  direction  of  wind  velocity  of  usual 
sunshine  and  cloudiness,  predictions  of  rain  or  snow  and  temperature  with  93%-98% 
verification  each  prediction.”21 

On  August  13,  1877,  Fish  wrote  a  more  direct  appeal  for  his  appointment  and  return 
to  the  Seal  Islands:

and  Agriculture,  compiled  by  Henry  W.  Elliott.19 


Biographies  F  ♦  Fish  -  Fowler 


I  have  long  had  in  contemplation  the  establishment  of  an  independent  Meteorological 
winter  Observatory  on  the  Seal  Islands,  and  if  appointed  to  an  agency  thereon,  or,  what  is 
far  more  necessary,  a  general  commissionship  there,  for,  I  know,  from  the  out  come  of  the 
past,  that  the  results  will  justify  my  selection.  At  the  risk  of  undue  self  assertion,  I  cannot 
but  beg  you  to  consider  that  I  know  more  of  Alaska,  including  the  Fur  Seal  Islands  whereon 
is  concentrated  the  principal  of  Alaskan  wealth,  than  any  other  American  visitor.  I  have 
paid  especial  attention  to  its  interesting  history  and  present  needs.  Indeed  concerning 
all  its  present  availabilities  and  future  claims  I  can  at  any  time,  if  ordered,  fully  report 
to  the  proper  governmental  center.  I  have  arranged  a  topographical  system  for  charting 
annually  the  seal  hauling  grounds;  although  naturally  opposed  with  violence  by  the 
Alaska  Commercial  Co.,  I  know  that  it  can  be  carried  into  successful  operation.  I  am  fully 
convinced  that  some  energy  for  the  preservation  of  our  valuable  Alaskan  interests  ought 
to  be  displayed,  contrasting  though  it  may  with  the  corruption  of  the  past.  With  a  final 
statement  that  Mrs.  Fish  taught  the  children  of  St.  Paul  Island  to  read,  write  and  speak  the 
English  language.22 

Charles  Pattison  Fish  never  returned  to  the  Pribilof  Islands.

Fur-Seal  Arbitration 

Herbert  V.  Fletcher  provided  the  following  deposition  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration 
before  Notary  Public  William  H.  Du  Bois  at  Randolph,  Vermont,  on  June  18,  1892: 

I  am  a  citizen  of  Randolph,  VT.,  where  I  have  had  my  home  nearly  all  my  life.  I  am  by  trade 
a  machinist  and  blacksmith  and  by  occupation  a  farmer.  In  1882  I  went  to  St.  Paul  Island 
in  the  service  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  as  their  chief  mechanic,  and  remained 
there  two  years  and  four  months,  including  the  sealing  seasons  of  1882,  1883,  and  1884. 

I  was  employed  a  considerable  portion  of  the  time  in  the  annual  seal  killing,  and  at  other 
times  my  work  took  me  frequently  to  the  various  parts  of  the  island,  so  that  in  the  course 
of  my  stay  there  I  became,  as  all  do  who  live  there  a  year  or  more,  very  familiar  with 
everything  pertaining  to  the  seals.23

1892,  before  Treasury  Agent-in-Charge  William  H.  Williams. 

I  am  46  years  of  age,  and  was  born  at  Stoneham,  Mass.  I  have  been  a  resident  of  the  Pribilof 
Islands  most  of  the  time  since  1879,  a  resident  of  the  seal  islands  for  the  past  ten  years; 
formerly  assistant  agent  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Com.,  now  agent  of  the  North  American 
[Commercial]  Company.  I  have  had  eight  years’  experience  on  the  sealing  fields  of  St.  Paul 
and  St.  George  islands,  and  I  have  a  practical  knowledge  of  the  habits  of  the  fur-seal  while 
on  the  islands,  and  of  the  methods  used  in  taking  and  preparing  the  skins  for  shipment.24 


Fowler,  Hubert  Green  (b.  1845) 

Assistant  Agent,  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury,  St.  Paul  Island,  1884-1885 
Genealogy 

Hubert  Green  Fowler  was  born  in  November  1845,  in  Stoneham,  Massachusetts,  to 
Benjamin  Fowler  and  Sophia  Cowdrey  (Stevens)  Fowler.  Colman  Lowell  Fowler  was  his 
brother.25 

Biographical  Sketch 

The  U.S.  Census  for  1880,  before  Hubert  Fowler’s  appointment  to  St.  Paul  Island,  noted 
that  he  was  a  school  principal  in  Norwich,  Connecticut.  He  later  settled  as  a  farmer  in 
Mona,  Richmond  County,  Montana,  where  he  was  still  living  in  1920. 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Agent  George  R.  Tingle’s  1885  annual  report  stated  that  Hubert  Fowler  was  “removed,” 
and  the  report  suggested  an  ominous  circumstance.26  Around  the  same  period  (April 
1885),  St.  Paul  Agent  Henry  Glidden  expressed  interest  in  the  outcome  of  the  presidential 
elections.27  Then  on  May  29,  1885,  Glidden  entered  into  the  Agent’s  Log  that  he  himself 
was  being  replaced  because  of  “a  change  in  the  politics  of  the  national  administration,” 
i.e.,  Benjamin  Harrison  had  defeated  President  Grover  Cleveland.  The  records  examined 
were  not  clear  on  this  point,  but  it’s  possible  that  Assistant  Agent  Fowler  and  Glidden 
were  both  political  appointees  and  consequently  lost  their  jobs  following  the  election.

Genealogy 

John  Fratis  was  born  January  20,  1845, 28  at  the  Ladrone  Islands29  (Guam),  among  the 
Mariana  Islands  in  the  South  Pacific  Ocean.  Agent  Charles  Bryant  noted  in  the  1873  St. 
Paul  Island  census  that  John  Fratis  was  a  Spanish  Creole  native  of  Guam.  Agent  Bryant 
wrote  in  his  annual  report  dated  September  20,  1873: 

An  attempt  was  made,  on  June  11,  by  the  general  agent  of  the  Alasl<a  Commercial 
Company  to  induce  the  chiefs  to  adopt,  as  a  native,  to  share  in  the  sealing  and  its  profits, 
an  employe  of  the  company,  a  Spanish  creole,  a  native  of  the  Ladrone  Islands.  This  being 
contrary  to  the  formerly  established  law  of  the  Russians,  and  the  principle  always  kept  in 
view  in  all  legislation — that  to  the  natives  of  the  island  belongs  the  privilege  of  doing  the 
labor  and  receiving  the  pay — this  was  not  permitted.30 

The  unnamed  individual  in  Bryant’s  report  was  very  likely  John  Fratis. 

John  Fratis  married  Poleana  (Ooleana)  Schepetina  [Stepeten],  a  native  of  St.  Paul 
Island,  in  October  1870.31  John  and  Poleana  Fratis  had  six  children,  all  born  on  St.  Paul 
Island:  Anna,  born  1870,  died  June  28,  1889;  Dahria  (a  daughter),  born  March  26,  1874;  a 
son,  May  7,  1876, 32  Susanna,  born  1877;  Ellen,  1883;  and  John  Jr.,  June  18,  1886. 

After  Poleana’s  death  circa  1889, 33  John  Sr.  left  St.  Paul  Island  for  Unalaska  on  August 
19,  1889,  in  search  of  a  new  wife.34  He  returned  to  St.  Paul  on  September  22,  1889, 35  mar¬ 
ried  to  nineteen-year-old  Akoolena  (Akulina)  Kozmia.36  Akulina  gave  birth  to  four  chil¬ 
dren  at  St.  Paul  Island:  Agrifma,  born  June  13,  1892;  Simeon,  February  15,  1894;  Juliana, 
January  13,  1896;  and  Martha,  February  19,  1899.37  John  Fratis  Sr.  died  January  26,  1906, 
on  St.  Paul  Island  at  sixty-four  years  of  age.3s 


Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

John  Fratis  Sr.  provided  the  following  deposition  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  June 
10, 1892,  before  Treasury  Agent-in-Charge  William  H.  Williams  at  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska: 

I  am  47  years  of  age  and  was  born  on  the  Ladrone  Islands.39 1  can  speak  the  English, 

Russian,  and  Spanish  languages,  and  I  understand  the  Aleut  as  it  is  spoken  by  the  natives 
of  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska.  I  came  to  St.  Paul  Island  in  1869,  and  married  a  native  woman 
and  became  one  of  the  people;  was  made  a  native  sealer  and  have  resided  here  ever  since. 

From  1859-1869, 1  was  employed  on  whaling  vessels  working  in  Bering  and  Okhotsk  Seas 
and  the  Arctic  Ocean.  I  have  been  along  the  coast  of  Bering  and  Okhotsk  seas  and  along 
the  coast  of  Alaska  in  the  North  Pacific  Ocean  from  Sitka  to  Unalaska,  and  I  never  saw  or 
heard  tell  of  any  place  in  American  waters  in  that  whole  region,  where  the  Alaskan  fur  seals 
haul  out  on  land  or  breed,  excepting  on  the  seal  islands  of  Bering  Sea  known  as  the  Pribilof 

Islands _ When  Mr.  Webster  had  charge  of  the  killing  at  Northeast  Point ...  I  generally

did  the  cooking  there,  and  I  cooked  seal  meat  every  day,  and  we  all  ate  it,  and  our  people 
live  on  seal  meat,  yet  I  never  saw  a  sick  or  a  diseased  seal  or  a  carcass  that  was  unfit  for

John  Fratis  landed  at  St.  Paul  Island  during  March  1869,  as  a  cook  in  the  employ  of 
Williams  and  Havens  Company  of  New  London,  Connecticut.  In  1870,  he  began  working 
as  a  cook  and  sealer  with  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company.  Fratis  spent  most  of  his  life 
on  St.  Paul  Island  except  for  the  year  1872-73,  which  he  spent  at  San  Francisco  because  of 
ill  health,  and  1891-92  when  he  and  his  family  wintered  at  St.  George  Island,  where  John 
Fratis  worked  as  cook  for  the  North  American  Commercial  Company.41

Gavitt,  William  (1855-1923) 

Special  Agent,  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury,  St.  George  Island,  1887-1888 
Genealogy 

William  Gavitt  was  born  in  January  1855  at  Evansville,  Indiana.  He  was  the  son  of 
Evansville’s  distinguished  Major  John  Smith  Gavitt,  who  died  in  a  Civil  War  battle  at 
Frederickstown,  Missouri,  on  October  21,  1861,  and  Frances  A.  (Lamphere)  Gavitt. 
William  Gavitt  married  Dora  Venneman  on  April  27,  1887,  in  Evansville.  One  week  after 


263 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


the  wedding,  the  couple  set  out  from  San  Francisco  for  Alaska,  arriving  at  St.  George 
Island  on  May  30  of  that  year.  William  Gavitt  died  on  August  7,  1923  in  Evansville. 


William  Gavitt  was  partly  educated  in  the 
public  schools  and  St.  John’s  school  of  this  city 
[Evansville],  and  partly  in  the  college  at  Teutopolis, 
Illinois.  [He]  was  a  student  at  Notre  Dame,  Indiana 
[at  age  17,  on  September  26,  1872,  studying 
Commerce;  he  received  a  Commercial  Diploma 
on  June  24,  1874],  and  afterward  [became  an] 
electrician  at  that  celebrated  institution  of  learning. 
When  a  mere  boy  he  was  upon  the  western  plains, 
during  the  Black  Hills  gold  excitement,  as  one 
of  the  advance  telegraph  operators.  In  1887,  he 
was  appointed  special  agent  for  the  United  States 
Treasury  Department,  in  charge  of  St.  George 
William  Gavitt.  (Univ.  of  Notre  Dame  Island,  Behring  Sea,  one  of  the  seal  islands.  He 

Archives.)  was  complimented  by  the  United  States  Senate 

in  reports  read  before  them  and  by  Hon.  C.S. 
Fairchild,  his  superior  officer,  then  secretary  of  the  treasury.  Mr.  Gavitt ’s  efforts  on 
behalf  of  the  oppressed  natives  of  Alaska  have  been  well  known  and  have  been  properly 
complimented.  He  will  do  his  duty  as  he  finds  it,  regardless  of  consequences.  He  was 
arbitrator  in  the  great  railroad  strikes  here,  when  capital  and  labor  were  in  anger  arrayed 
against  each  other.  In  brief,  these  sorts  of  differences,  because  of  his  high  sense  of  fitness 
and  justice,  were  usually  referred  to  him,  and  he  did  the  public  much  good  by  his  wise 
decisions  and  timely  services.  He  was  a  citizen  who  was  well  known.10 


Biographical  Sketch 

William  Gavitt  and  his  brothers  John  and  Joseph 
were  raised  by  their  grandmother,  Alice  Smith 
Gavitt.  After  her  death  in  1867,  the  boys’  guard¬ 
ian,  John  Augustus  Reitz,  saw  to  their  education. 
Reitz,  a  wealthy  businessman  involved  with  rail¬ 
roads,  banking,  and  real  estate,  had  a  great  influ¬ 
ence  on  Gavitt.8  In  1897,  author  Joseph  P.  Elliott 
summarized  the  achievements  of  William  Gavitt ’s 
life,  which  he  characterized  as  an  honorable  one:9 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

William  Gavitt ’s  service  as  a  special  agent  of  the  Treasury  Department  at  the  Seal  Islands 
lasted  just  over  one  year,  from  May  1887  through  August  1888.  Whether  he  became  a 
victim  of  powerful  foes  or  simply  couldn’t  endure  the  pressures  of  remote  island  life  is  for 
other  students  of  history  to  ascertain. 

In  his  reports  on  St.  George  Island  activities,  Special  Agent  Gavitt  levied  accusations 
of  impropriety  against  employees  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company.  Those  reports  led 
to  the  formation  of  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives  Committee  on  Merchant  Marine 
and  Fisheries,  originally  convened  as  a  special  committee 

[t]o  investigate  the  fur-seal  fisheries  of  Alaska  and  all  contracts  or  leases  made  by  the 
Government  with  any  person  or  companies  for  the  taking  of  fur  seals  and  other  fur-bearing

animals  in  Alaska;  the  character,  duration,  and  condition  of  such  contracts  or  leases;  and 
whether  and  to  what  extent  the  same  have  been  enforced  and  complied  with  or  violated; 
the  receipts  there-from,  and  the  expenses  incurred  by  the  Government  on  account  of  any 
such  contract  or  leases;  and  to  fully  investigate  and  report  upon  the  nature  and  extent  of 
the  rights  and  interests  of  the  United  States  in  the  fur  seals  and  other  fisheries  in  the  Bering 
Sea  in  Alaska;  whether  and  to  what  extent  the  same  have  been  violated,  and  by  whom;  and 
what,  if  any,  legislation  is  necessary  for  the  better  protection  and  preservation  of  the  same.11 

On  December  18,  1888,  William  Gavitt  testified  before  the  U.S.  House  Committee  on 
Merchant  Marine  and  Fisheries  regarding  his  earlier  allegations  of  maltreatment  of  the 
Aleuts  on  St.  George  Island,  as  well  as  of  government  officials,  by  employees  of  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company.  For  example,  Gavitt  alleged  that  some  Native  husbands  were 
threatened  with  physical  harm  if  their  wives  were  not  allowed  to  visit  the  ACC  employees 
for  immoral  purposes.  An  Aleut  girl  was  denied  the  right  of  marriage  “in  order  to  keep 
that  girl  for  a  prostitute.”  The  island  priest  was  intimidated  for  attempting  to  intervene  on 
behalf  of  his  parishioners.12  The  modern  term  “whistle-blower”  could  aptly  apply  to  him. 

The  company’s  intentions,  I  believe,  are  honest  and  upright,  but  in  regard  to  their  men 
employed  on  the  island  I  can  not  use  severe  language  sufficient  to  cover  their  case.  The 
men  with  whom  I  have  dealt,  that  is,  myself  and  my  wife,  did  not  respect  the  laws  of  God, 
or  man  or  my  wife’s  presence  or  my  position.  I  am  referring  to  Mr.  Webster,  Dr.  Lutz,  John 
Kirk,  and  a  man  named  John  Hall.  This  administration  expected  a  Government  officer  to 
take  his  wife  there,  and  I  took  my  wife  from  the  altar  to  the  St.  George  Island,  and  I  have 
regretted  it  ever  since.  I  wish  a  distinction  to  be  understood  between  the  honest  intention 
of  the  gentlemen  in  San  Francisco  and  that  crowd  of  men  that  they  have  entrusted  with 
their  business  on  that  island.  I  wish  for  that  to  be  distinctly  understood.  I  believe  that 
the  company  itself  is  honest  and  upright  in  its  intentions. ...  I  refer  to  their  powers  to 
antagonize  a  sworn  officer  of  the  law  and  to  make  him  miserable  and  crucify  him.13 

Gavitt  lacked  influential  and  outspoken  supporters  willing  or  able  to  testify  in  his 
favor.  He  stood  nearly  alone  in  his  attack  against  the  injustices  he  observed  at  St.  George 
Island.  He  did  have  the  support  of  at  least  some  of  the  St.  George  Island  Natives  (see  Peter 
Rezanoff’s  biography).  However,  they  apparently  lacked  credibility  among  members  of 
the  congressional  committee. 

Gavitt  was  characterized  by  others,  including  his  supervisor,  Special  Treasury  Agent 
of  the  Seal  Islands  George  Tingle,  as  an  incompetent  man  with  a  weak  mind,  unable 
to  perform  the  task  at  hand.  Tingle  obtained  affidavits  from  ACC  employees  Dr.  Lutz, 
Daniel  Webster,  and  John  Kirk  denying  Gavitt ’s  allegations.  Gavitt  was  further  discredited 
in  testimonies  given  by  those  called  before  the  committee;  they  claimed  that  no  impropri¬ 
eties  or  misconduct  by  employees  of  the  lessee  had  occurred  on  the  Island  of  St.  George. 
Agent  Tingle  presented  William  Gavitt  to  the  Committee  as  a  man  who  had  disturbed 
harmony  between  the  Natives  and  the  white  people  of  the  station  and  who  had  falsified 
the  Treasury  Department’s  daily  journal  (the  log).14 

Few  came  to  Gavitt ’s  defense,  but  one  was  Special  Agent  T.  F.  Ryan.  A  New  York  Times 
article  reported: 

T.F.  Ryan,  another  special  agent  of  the  Government  at  the  island  of  St.  George  from  April 
1885  to  1887,  attributed  the  lack  of  discipline  and  the  loose  morals  on  the  island  of  St. 

George  partly  to  the  improper  conduct  and  neglect  of  duty  of  some  of  the  Government 
agents,  which  was  in  turn  imitated  by  the  agents  of  the  company.  When  witness  [Ryanij] 
went  to  the  islands  he  had  no  instructions  from  the  Government.  The  Secretary  of  the 


265 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Treasury  had  told  him  to  write  his  own  instructions.  Witness  then  formulated  rules 
forbidding  females  on  the  island  from  visiting  the  company  and  the  Government  houses, 
but  Mr.  Tingle,  his  superior  officer,  had  declared  such  a  rule  null  and  void.  It  was  impossible 
to  imagine,  he  said,  what  influenced  Mr.  Tingle  to  do  this,  as  the  order  was  issued  in  the 
interests  of  law  and  decency.16 

The  1888  congressional  investigation  focused  the  attention  of  leading  newspapers 
on  the  affairs  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  in  the  Seal  Islands.  Critics  took  aim  at 
and  weakened  the  company’s  credibility  as  a  lessee  when  it  was  vying  for  renewal  of  the 
twenty-year  contract  the  next  year.  The  Alaska  Commercial  Company  lost  the  contract, 
although  not  entirely,  if  at  all,  due  to  Gavitt’s  expose;  other  political  intrigues  involving 
President  Benjamin  Harrison  and  Secretary  of  State  James  Blaine  likely  played  significant¬ 
ly  in  the  decision  to  award  the  new  twenty-year  lease  to  the  North  American  Commercial 
Company.  George  Tingle,  government  agent  testifying  in  opposition  to  Gavitt,  became 
agent  of  the  North  American  Commercial  Company. 

The  committee  failed  to  take  issue  with  Gavitt’s  allegations,  and  life  on  the  Pribilofs 
continued  without  change.  Gavitt  returned  to  Indiana,  where  he  had  a  strong  family  pres¬ 
ence.  After  his  year  in  Alaska,  he  became  a  community  leader,  recognized  as  a  strong 
individual— not  a  weak  personage,  as  presented  to  the  committee  by  men  of  influence. 

Possibly  Gavitt’s  personality  was  ill-suited  for  St.  George  community  life.  Even  today 
environmental  conditions  are  harsh,  and  despite  having  satellite  communications  and 
paved  runways  (installed  2005-06),  the  Pribilof  Islands— and  St.  George  Island  in  par¬ 
ticular — remain  relatively  isolated  from  mainland  Alaska.  Outsiders  who  worked  on 
those  remote  islands  for  any  length  of  time  in  the  late  nineteenth  century  likely  possessed 
strong-willed  and  often  rough  personalities,  and  their  work  required  physical  stamina 
unlike  anything  imaginable  today.  Further,  their  employers,  both  public  and  private,  ex¬ 
pected  financial  success,  which  was  not  easily  achieved.  Such  men  might  well  not  respect 
those  with  more  gentle  manners. 

As  a  postscript,  the  character  and  credibility  of  William  Gavitt’s  supervisor,  George 
Tingle,  came  into  question  in  1890  when  he  encountered  Treasury  Agent  Charles  Goff 
(see  Goff’s  and  Tingle’s  biographies).

Biographical  Sketch 

Richard  Geoghegan  had  a  childhood  accident  which  left  him  physically  disabled  for 
life.  According  to  Pribilof  Islands  historian  and  Aleut  civil  liberties  advocate  Fredericka 
Martin,  his  physical  handicap  steered  his  interest  toward  self-study  of  language,  beginning 
with  Chinese.  His  scholarly  achievements  earned  him  scholarships  to  Oxford  University 
from  linguists  Professor  James  Legge  and  Oxford  University  Vice-Chancellor  Jowett.  He 
graduated  and  taught  languages  at  various  colleges  in  England.  Then,  as  he  recounted: 

When  I  came  to  Alaska,  in  the  fall  of  1902,  the  possible  connections  between  the  Asiatic 
and  the  American  languages  attracted  my  attention  and  as  at  that  time,  I  was  in  the  employ 
of  our  Uncle  Samuel  [“Uncle  Sam”]  as  an  officer  of  his  district  court,20 1  had  an  opportunity 
for  traveling  over  practically  all  parts  of  this  Territory,  and  became  especially  intrigued  by 
the  Aleut  tongue.  My  official  duties  and  the  necessity  for  constantly  moving  from  place  to 
place  allowed  me  but  scant  opportunity  to  acquire  a  speaking  knowledge  of  it,  or  even  to 
make  all  the  notes  that  I  should  have  desired,  but,  later,  when  I  settled  in  Fairbanks,  1  took 
pains  to  secure  all  the  known  printed  matter  in  and  on  Aleutian.  This,  not  with  the  idea 
of  dedicating  my  days  to  “Innuitology,”  but  rather  for  the  purpose  of  making  comparisons 
with  Chinese,  Japanese,  Manchu,  Tibetan,  Korean,  Siamese  and  Kambojoan,21  etc.,  whereof 
I  picked  up  smatterings  in  the  previous  years.22 

Fredericka  Martin  followed  Geoghegan’s  commentary  with  her  own: 

A  smattering,  if  I  may  be  forgiven  for  explaining  the  obvious,  often  seemed  to  Richard 
Geoghegan  synonymous  with  what  others  would  consider  the  result  of  a  lifetime’s  study, 
for  his  “smatterings”  consisted  of  an  encyclopedic  knowledge  of  over  two  hundred 
languages  and  dialects.23 

Richard  Geoghegan’s  death  left  his  good  friend  Fredericka  Martin  to  complete  work 
on  his  book  The  Aleut  Language.  However,  Geoghegan’s  words  introduced  his  work: 

The  Aleut  language  is  such  a  strongly  differentiated 
dialect  of  the  regular  Eskimo  language  that  it  may 
almost  be  characterized  as  a  distinct  language 
although  its  structure  is  purely  Eskimoid. 

Dr.  Svend  Frederiksen  of  the  University  of 
Copenhagen  informed  me  that  specimens  of  the 
language  spoken  on  Kodiak  Island  which  I  sent 
him  were  readily  understandable.  He  is  thoroughly 
conversant  with  Greenlandic  Eskimo.  However  the 
examples  of  Aleut  I  submitted,  with  the  exception 
of  an  occasional  word,  were  not  comprehensible. 

And  the  Reverend  Hinz  who  has  written  a  grammar 
of  the  Kuskokwim  Eskimo  dialect,  reported  that 
although  he  could  understand  the  samples  of 
Kodiak  dialect  the  Aleutian  seemed  almost  a 
foreign  tongue. 

These  differences  pose  an  interesting  problem  for 
philologists.24 

The  present  authors  did  not  learn  whether 
Richard  Geoghegan  ever  visited  the  Pribilof 
Islands,  but  the  significance  of  his  contribution

Gill,  Edward  James  (1851-1876) 

Meteorologist,  U.S.  Army  Signal  Corps,  Weather  Service,  1876 
Genealogy 

Edward  James  Gill  was  born  March  21,  1851,  in  Brooklyn,  New  York,  the  son  of  James 
Darrell  Gill  and  Emily  W.  (Vosburgh)  Gill.  Edward  Gill  was  orphaned  at  an  early  age. 
Edward’s  mother  died  in  Brooklyn,  New  York,  February  11,  1857.  Edward  Gill’s  father 
was  born  in  Newfoundland,  Canada,  of  Nicolas  Gill  and  Elizabeth  (Burton)  Gill.  James 
Darrell  Gill  died  in  Brooklyn  on  March  9,  1864.  Edward’s  siblings  were:  Theodore  Nicolas; 
Adelaide  E.;  Albert  J.;  Anselle  V.  W.;  Caroline  Emily;  and  Herbert  A.  Gill.  Edward  J.  Gill 
died  on  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska,  October  22,  1876. 25 

Biography 

Edward  James  Gill  was  descended  from  Captain  Michael  Gill  (1672-1720),  a  merchant 
trader  of  Charlestown,  Massachusetts,  who  in  1698  began  shipping  salt,  salt  pork,  and 
New  England  cider  to  Newfoundland.  Michael’s  two  sons,  Michael  Jr.  (1699-1773)  and 
Nicholas  Gill,  emigrated  from  New  England  to  St.  John’s,  Newfoundland,  and  by  1768 
were  leaders  in  Newfoundland’s  government.  “The  Gills  seem  to  have  held  most  of  the 
Government  offices;  Michael  was  Judge  of  the  Vice-Admiralty  Court,  Keeper  of  the  Rolls, 
J.P.  [Justice  of  the  Peace],  public  auctioneer,  sole  sworn  broker,  and  sole  notary  public, 
and,  later  on,  lieutenant-colonel  of  militia;  his  brother  Nicholas  seems  to  have  had  all 
the  other  posts.”26  In  the  1790s,  Edward’s  grandfather,  Nicolas  Gill  Jr.  (1770-1855),  with 
Edward’s  uncle,  Joseph  Gill,  founded  Gill  &  Company,  a  trading  firm  headquartered  at  St. 
John’s. 

The  Gill  firm  was  involved  in  the  West  Indian  trade  exporting  salt  cod  to  the  Indies  and 
importing  rum  and  molasses.  Nicolas  also  established  a  branch  of  the  firm  in  New  York 
City  in  the  1830’s.  Nicolas  Gill  sent  his  son  James  Darrell  Gill  to  New  York  to  manage  the 
family  firm.  That  firm  operated  as  a  distribution  centre  for  Newfoundland  products  such 
as  seal  pelts,  seal  oil,  cod-liver  oil,  and  furs.  In  return,  sugar,  corned  beef,  and  clothing  were 
shipped  to  Newfoundland.27 

Descendants  of  the  Gill  family  in  the  United  States  prospered  and  continued  the  family 
relationship  with  the  sea — not  in  the  pursuit  of  commerce  but  in  the  pursuit  of  science. 
Three  brothers  were  involved  with  the  Bering  Sea  and  the  Seal  Islands.  Edward,  the  sub¬ 
ject  of  this  biography,  embarked  on  a  career  with  the  Army  Signal  Corps  Weather  Service 
as  a  meteorologist,  although  his  life  ended  suddenly  on  St.  Paul  Island.  Edward’s  sister, 
Caroline  Gill,  acknowledged  him  in  her  last  will  and  testament: 

Item  6. 1  give  and  bequeath  to  the  Bishop  of  the  Protestant  Episcopal  Church  in  Alaska 
in  whose  jurisdiction  is  located  the  grave  of  my  brother  Edward  J.  Gill,  in  the  Island  of  St. 

Paul,  Alaska,  and  his  successors  in  office  the  sum  of  One  thousand  dollars  ($1000)  in  trust

to  invest  and  re-invest  the  same  in  some  safe  securities  and  to  apply  the  income  arising 
there  from  to  the  care  of  the  grave  and  headstone  of  my  said  brother.28 

Edwards  older  brother,  Theodore  Nicolas  Gill  (1837—1914),  became  a  recognized 
expert  taxonomist  in  ornithology,  ichthyology,  mammalogy,  and  malacology.  He  became 
a  librarian  at  the  Smithsonian  Institution,  and  later  he  became  an  assistant  librar¬ 
ian  (1866-75)  at  the  Library  of  Congress.  He  became  a  professor  of  zoology  at  George 
Washington  University.  Edward’s  younger  brother,  Herbert  A.  Gill  (1857-1937),  served 
as  the  chief  clerk  of  the  U.S.  Fish  Commission  in  Washington,  D.C.,  in  1893.  During 
1895-96,  Herbert  Gill  served  as  the  Acting  Commissioner  of  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Fisheries, 
which  had  authority  over  the  Seal  Islands.29 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

In  May  1876,  the  St.  Paul  Island  Bering  Sea  Weather  and  Signal  Station  was  the  most  remote 
of  the  twenty-two  Signal  Service  stations31’  under  the  War  Department.31  Meteorologist 
Edward  Gill  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  on  May  20,  1876,  to  replace  meteorologist  Charles 
P.  Fish,  who  had  resigned  his  commission.32  Gill  was  the  second  meteorologist  stationed 
on  St.  Paul  Island  after  the  inception  of  the  National  Weather  Service  within  the  U.S. 
Army  Signal  Service  in  1870.  (See  Charles  P.  Fish  biography  for  a  brief  history  of  the  Army 
Signal  Corps,  Signal  Service,  and  Weather  Service).  He  was  in  government  service  for 
only  five  months  before  he  died  on  October  22,  1876,  of  a  heart  attack  resulting  from  ex¬ 
haustion  and  cold.  He  had  ventured  to  the  north  shore  of  St.  Paul  Island  with  Dr.  Dennis 
Meany  and  carpenter  Seth  Washburn.  The  men  were  guided  by  two  Natives,  Antone 
Melovedoff  and  Ivan  Galanin,  when  a  gale  overtook  the  party. 

They  crossed  the  island  by  the  eastern  base  of  Bogosloff  and  arrived  at  the  north  shore 
about  eleven  o’clock,  stopped  at  the  station  house  there  and  lunched,  from  there  they 
started  to  follow  the  shore  around  the  west  end  and  south  side  of  the  island  back  to  the 
village  stopping  at  the  north  west  station  house  to  lunch  again  continuing  on  past  the 
west  point  and  turned  then  heading  for  the  station  at  S.W.  bay  and  when  within  one  mile 
of  there  the  storm  came  on,  the  wind  blowing  in  their  faces  they  were  soon  wet  through. 

Here  Mr.  Gill  first  gave  out  complaining  of  weakness  in  his  knees.  They  reached  the  station 
house  there  at  a  quarter  before  five.  The  old  house  here  had  been  allowed  to  go  into  decay 
and  a  new  one  partially  built  in  that  there  was  no  shelter  there  and  the  whole  party  were 
too  exhausted  that  to  remain  there  would  be  at  the  risk  of  all  their  lives.  The  two  natives 
were  sent  forward  to  reach  the  village  and  send  assistance  while  the  others  followed  as 
they  best  could.  These  two  natives  reached  the  village  about  half  past  seven  but  [were]  so 
worn  out  that  at  first  they  could  not  be  understood.  As  soon  as  they  were  able  to  give  the 
necessary  information,  the  mules  were  harnessed  to  the  wagon  and  Mr.  Hamden  McIntyre 
and  a  driver  started.  But,  owing  to  the  thick  darkness,  it  was  necessary  for  one  to  go  on 
foot  ahead  with  a  lantern  to  find  the  way.  [W]hen  a  half  mile  out  Mr.  Washburn  was  met 
saying  that  Mr.  Gill  was  near  the  lake  unable  to  come  any  further  and  that  Dr.  Meany  was 
with  him.  All  possible  haste  was  made  and  on  reaching  the  lake,  Mr.  Gill  was  found  to  be 
helpless  and  Dr.  Meany  was  in  a  dangerous  condition.  They  were  immediately  brought  to 
the  house  where  preparations  were  made  to  receive  them.  All  possible  efforts  were  made 
to  restore  them  with  the  foregoing  result.  On  leaving  S.  W.  bay  Mr.  Gill  was  unable  to 
travel  without  assistance.  Dr.  Meany  and  Mr.  Washburn  had  him  between  them  until  they 
reached  the  head  of  the  Lagoon  when  the  tide  was  so  high  that  they  had  to  walk  on  the 
upland  where  the  thick  grass  so  entangled  Mr.  Gills  feet  as  to  make  traveling  impossible  so 
that  at  this  point  Mr.  Gill  lay  down.  Dr.  Meany  remained]  and  help[ed]  his  limbs  and  body 
to  keep  up  the  circulation  while  Mr.  Washburn  continued  to  the  village,  reaching  it  without

assistance  before  the  boyes  [sic]  overtook  him  on  their  return. . . .  Mr.  Hamden  McIntyre 
[of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company]  took  charge  of  the  body,  had  him  removed  to  his 
quarters  and  laid  out  in  his  uniform. . . .  Mr.  McIntyre  made  a  coffin.  A  grave  was  dug  in  the 
cemetery  by  permission  for  his  interment  with  the  understanding  that  should  there  be  any 
objection  from  the  priest  to  his  remaining  there  he  is  to  be  removed.33 

Edward  James  Gill’s  remains  still  lie  undisturbed  beneath  a  granite  stone  in  the  grave¬ 
yard  adjacent  to  the  Russian  Orthodox  Church  at  St.  Paul  Island.

Glidden,  Henry  A.  (b.  1821) 

Agent,  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury,  St.  Paul  Island,  1882-1885 
Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Agent  Henry  Glidden’s  entries  into  the  Agent’s  Log  offered  perspective  on  the  isolation 
of  the  Pribilof  Islands.  His  entries  during  April  of  1885,  also  suggested  concern  about  his 
future  as  agent,  as  agents  were  typically  political  appointees  during  that  era. 

The  steamer  Dora  appeared  in  sight  in  the  direction  of  St.  George  island,  apparently  from 
six  to  ten  miles  away.  A  cordon  of  ice  about  the  island  of  St.  Paul  prevented  her  coming  any 
nearer  and  she  was  obliged  to  put  back  and  return  to  Onnalaska.  It  was  an  aggravation  and 
a  disappointment  as  we  were  curious  to  get  the  news  from  the  outside  world,  especially  the 
result  of  the  presidential  election  in  November  last.

Capt.  Williams  of  the  brig  Hidalgo  called  at  the  island  for  a  few  moments  and  brought  us 
a  bundle  of  papers.  From  these  we  learn  that  Grover  Cleveland,  a  democrat,  was  elected 
president.34 

Glidden’s  brief  entry  to  the  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s  Log,  May  29,  1885,  stated,  “Being 
relieved  from  duty  by  a  change  in  the  politics  of  the  national  administration.  I  return  to 
San  Francisco  by  the  St.  Paul  in  a  few  days”35  George  R.  Tingle  replaced  him  as  agent-in- 
charge  on  that  day. 

According  to  the  Agent’s  Log,  Henry  Glidden’s  wife  accompanied  him  on  the  island 
during  his  tenure.36

agent  in  charge  of  the  seal  islands  under  Secretary  Folger.  On  May  31,  1882, 1  arrived  on  St. 

Paul  Island,  and  remained  there  until  June  8,  1885,  only  returning  once  to  the  States  to  pass 
the  winter  of  1883-84. 1  was  located  the  entire  time  on  St.  Paul  Island.37 


Goff,  Charles  James  (1847-1905) 

Special  Agent,  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury,  St.  Paul  Island,  1889-1890 


Genealogy 

Charles  Goff  was  born  on  July  3, 1847,  at  the  family 
home  known  as  “Waldomore”3s  in  Clarksburg, 
Harrison  County,  Virginia  (now  West  Virginia). 
Charles  was  the  fifth  child  of  nine  children  born 
to  Waldo  Potter  Goff  and  Harriet  Louise  (Moore) 
Goff.  Charles  Goff  married  Eva  S.  Hart  (1855-95), 
daughter  of  Ira  Hart,  the  local  iron  works  manu¬ 
facturer,  on  October  31,  1876,  in  Clarksburg. 
After  a  successful  business  career,  “Charles  James 
Goff,  died  57  years  old,  at  Providence  Hospital, 
Washington,  D.C.,  Jan.  7,  1905.”39 

Biographical  Sketch 

Charles  Goff  spent  his  formative  years  in  the  com¬ 
pany  of  such  prominent  relatives  as  his  father,  a 
“self  made  prosperous  merchant  and  land  specu¬ 
lator,”  justice  of  the  peace  and  former  state  sena¬ 
tor;40  his  uncle,  Nathan,  who  “organized  the  First 

National  Bank  in  Harrison  County,  became  the

county’s  wealthiest  citizen,  and  served  several  terms  in  the  West  Virginia  Legislature;”41 
and  brothers  Thomas,  a  physician,  and  Nathan  Jr.,  a  lawyer  and  politician. 

Charles  Goff's  military  service  as  a  U.S.  Volunteer  from  Virginia  during  the  Civil 
War  earned  him  the  rank  of  captain  and  artillery  quartermaster  in  the  Union  Army.42  In 
1898,  Captain  Goff  volunteered  to  serve  the  United  States  during  the  Spanish-American 
War,  and  served  as  an  assistant  quartermaster.  Captain  Charles  Goff  became  part  of  the 
Harrison  County  delegation  to  the  Republican  State  Convention  on  July  27,  1876.43 

The  1880  U.S.  Census  recorded  the  family  as  living  in  the  Coal  District  of  Clarksburg, 
with  Charles  Goff  working  as  a  liquor  merchant,  and  his  wife,  Eva,  age  25,  keeping  house. 
The  census  also  listed  a  daughter,  Ira  Hart,  age  one  and  one-half  years.  Goff’s  Uncle 
Nathan  (1798-1885),  age  82,  a  banker,  lived  next  door.44  In  1881,  Goff’s  brother  Nathan 
Jr.  was  appointed  Secretary  of  the  Navy  in  President  Rutherford  Hayes’  Cabinet.  Nathan 
Jr.  asked  Secretary  of  the  Interior  Carl  Schurz  to  appoint  his  brother  Charles  as  an  Indian 
agent  in  New  Mexico.45  Charles’  subsequent  experience  in  New  Mexico,  as  well  as  the 
Goff  family’s  political  position  in  the  Republican  Party,  presumably  led  to  his  selection  as 
a  Treasury  agent  for  St.  Paul  Island  in  1889,  under  the  newly  installed  Republican  presi¬ 
dent,  Benjamin  Harrison.  His  appointment  followed  the  resignation  of  Treasury  Agent 
George  R.  Tingle,  a  fellow  West  Virginian. 

The  lives  of  brothers  Charles  and  Nathan  Jr.  were  closely  knit  in  politics  as  well  as  in 
business.  Many  of  Charles  Goff’s  business  ventures  such  as  those  in  Clarksburg,  West 
Virginia  are  listed  in  Acts  of  the  West  Virginia  Legislature. 46  Among  his  partners  in  these 
buisiness  ventures  was  Hugh  H.  McIntyre,  former  government  special  agent  and  then 
ACC  superintendent  and  general  manager  on  St.  Paul  Island. Charles’  business  ventures 
included: 

Feb  10,  1883:  Atwell  Burglar  Proof  Sash  Lock  Company,  Clarksburg 

March  3,  1884:  Clarksburg  Natural  Gas  Company,  Clarksburg  (his  brothers-in-law  John  B. 

Hart  and  Charles  M.  Hart  were  also  partners) 

1886-1890:  silver  mill  in  New  Mexico  (partners  included  his  brother  Nathan  Jr.)47 

August  8,  1887:  Harrison  County  Oil  and  Gas  Company  was  incorporated.  (His  brother, 
now  Judge  Nathan  Goff,  and  brother-in-law  Charles  M.  Hart  were  members.)  “The 
Company’s  purpose  was  to  bore  for,  obtain,  and  sell  oil  and  natural  gas,  with  its  main  office 
in  Clarksburg,”  with  a  total  authorized  capital  of  $500, 000.48 

March  31,  1890:  Harrison  County  Development 
Company,  "organized  by  a  certain  H.H.  McIntyre 
of  West  Randolph,  VT.”49  “The  company’s  purpose 
was  to  mine,  manufacture  and  sell  oil,  gas,  coal, 
iron  ore  and  other  minerals,  and  to  construct 
necessary  tramways  and  railways,  with  its  main 
office  in  Clarksburg.”50 

November,  1893:  Cherry  Camp  Oil  Company 
(brother  Nathan  Jr.  was  also  a  partner)51 

Charles  Goff  died  in  1905.  His  obituary  from  Goff  homestead  “ Waldomore (National

Captain  Goff’s  Death. 

Captain  Charles  J.  Goff,  of  this  city,  died  in  Providence  hospital  in  Washington  City  at  6:00 
o’clock  Saturday  morning,  but  word  was  not  received  here  until  6:00  o’clock  that  evening. 

He  had  been  in  Washington  about  a  month  and  was  stopping  at  the  National  Hotel.  A  week 
prior  to  his  death  he  was  seized  with  pneumonia  and  Wednesday  was  removed  from  the 
hotel  to  the  hospital,  where  his  condition  was  not  regarded  serious  until  a  few  hours  before 
death  came. 

Charles  J.  Goff  was  born  in  Clarksburg  fifty-seven  years  ago,  and  was  a  son  of  Waldo  P. 

Goff,  now  deceased,  who  was  a  prominent  merchant  that  came  here  from  New  York  in 
pioneer  days  and  became  one  of  Clarksburg’s  leading  citizens.  Captain  Goff  married  Miss 
Eva  Hart,  sister  of  Messrs.  Charles  M.  and  John  B.  Hart,  Mrs.  H.  T.  Wilson  and  Miss  Lillie 
Hart,  and  daughter  of  Ira  Hart,  now  deceased.  Mrs.  Goff  died  nine  years  ago  last  July. 

Surviving  him  of  the  immediate  family  is  his  daughter,  Mrs.  Ira  Camden,  wife  of  S.  D. 

Camden,  of  Parkersburg;  Judge  Nathan  Goff,  his  brother,  Mrs.  Richard  T.  Lowndes,  Sr.,  and 
Mrs.  George  W.  Porter,  of  Indianapolis,  sisters  of  the  deceased. 

Captain  Goff  served  as  a  railway  mail  clerk  a  number  of  years,  running  between  Grafton 
and  Washington  City,  and  under  the  Harrison  administration  he  served  as  inspector  and 
agent  for  the  United  States  government  at  the  Island  of  St.  Paul,  near  Alaska,  the  work  of 
the  position  being  the  protection  of  furs,  seals,  fisheries,  etc.  Later  he  was  Immigration 
Inspector  for  the  United  States  and  was  stationed  at  Montreal  and  other  parts  of  Canada 
and  other  points  of  country  [sic],  having  his  headquarters  for  some  time  in  New  York  City. 

During  the  Spanish-American  war  Captain  Goff  held  a  position  as  assistant  quartermaster 
and  had  charge  of  the  transport,  now  Thomas,  running  then  between  Key  West  and  Cuba 
and  part  of  the  time  was  stationed  at  Santiago,  Cuba,  and  after  the  famous  battle  was  in 
charge  of  the  department  of  supplies  there. 

At  the  close  of  the  war  he  came  home  and  engaged  in  the  development  of  oil  fields  in  the 
county,  especially  near  and  around  Bristol,  where  a  splendid  development  was  well  under 
way  at  the  time  of  his  demise,  and  from  which  he  and  those  associated  with  him  in  the 
business  were  deriving  handsome  revenues. 

The  deceased  was  one  of  Clarksburg’s  life-long  prominent  citizens  in  business,  society 
and  politics.  For  many  years  he  was  active  in  the  Republican  battles  for  supremacy  in  this 
state  and  did  the  party  good  service,  commanding  at  all  times  a  wide  influence,  not  only 
in  his  native  county,  but  other  parts  of  the  state  as  well.  He  was  a  gentleman  of  intellectual 
attainment,  cultured  and  whole-souled  and  every  one  who  knew  him  did  so  only  to  be  his 
friend,  as  he  was  one  whose  friendship  was  warm  and  sincere. 

The  remains  arrived  Monday  morning  accompanied  by  Dr.  W.P.  Goff,  his  nephew,  and  S.D. 
Camden,  his  son-in-law,  who  went  to  Washington  City  Saturday  night  to  bring  them  home, 
and  were  taken  to  his  home  at  the  Waldomoore  [sic]. 

The  funeral  will  be  held  at  the  residence  Tuesday  afternoon  at  2:30  o’clock  and  will  be 
conducted  by  Rev.  J.  F.  Plummer,  of  Christ  Episcopal  church.  Interment  will  be  in  the  Odd 
Fellows  cemetery.52 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Charles  GofF  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  in  Washington,  D.C.,  on  April  13, 
1892,  before  Notary  Public  Sevellon  A.  Brown.  Following  is  an  excerpt  from  his  deposi¬ 
tion. 


I  am  45  years  of  age.  During  the  years  1889  and  1890  I  occupied  the  position  of  special 
Treasury  agent  in  charge  of  the  Pribilof  Islands.  I  was  located  on  St.  Paul  Island,  only 
visiting  St.  George  Island  occasionally.  About  the  1st  of  June,  1889, 1  arrived  on  St.  Paul 


273 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Island  and  remained  there  until  October  12,  1889,  when  I  returned  to  San  Francisco  for 
the  winter.  Again  went  to  the  islands  in  1890,  arriving  there  about  the  last  week  in  May 
and  remaining  until  August  12,  1890. . . .  During  my  first  year  on  the  islands  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company  was  the  lessee  thereof,  and  during  my  second  year  the  North 
American  Commercial  Company.  In  1889, 1  made  careful  observations  of  the  rookeries 
on  St.  Paul  Island  and  marked  out  the  areas  covered  by  the  breeding  grounds.  In  1890  I 
examined  these  lines  made  by  me  the  former  year  and  found  a  very  great  shrinkage  in  the 
spaces  covered  by  breeding  seals. 

In  1889  it  was  quite  difficult  for  the  lessees  to  obtain  their  full  quota  of  100,000  skins;  so 
difficult  was  it  in  fact,  that  in  order  to  turn  off  a  sufficient  number  of  four  and  five  years- 
old  males  from  the  hauling  grounds  for  breeding  purposes  in  the  future,  the  lessees  were 
compelled  to  take  about  50,000  skins  of  seals  of  one  or  two  years  of  age.  I  at  once  reported 
this  fact  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  and  advised  the  taking  of  a  less  number  of  skins 
the  following  year.  Pursuant  to  such  report  the  Government  fixed  upon  the  number  of 
skins  to  be  taken  as  60,000,  and  further  ordered  that  all  killing  of  seals  upon  the  islands 
should  stop  after  the  20th  day  of  July.  I  was  further  ordered  that  I  should  notify  the  natives 
upon  the  Aleutian  Islands  that  all  killing  of  seals  while  coming  from  or  going  to  the  seal 
islands  was  prohibited.53 

Charles  James  Goff  came  from  a  financially  secure  and  politically  powerful  family. 
He  was  not  one  to  be  easily  intimidated,  and  by  association  with  his  brother  Nathan,  he 
represented  a  political  threat  to  the  North  American  Commercial  Company  (NACC)  and 
to  Stephen  B.  Elkins,  who  in  1891  became  the  Secretary  of  War  (see  Elkins  biography). 
Circumstantial  it  may  be,  but  Goff’s  involuntary  resignation  as  Treasury  agent  suggests 
he  became  a  victim  of  politics. 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Whereas  William  Gavitt  created  a  controversy  over  abuses  to  humans  on  the  Pribilofs 
(see  Gavitt’s  biography),  Charles  James  Goff  stirred  the  pot  to  a  boil  over  the  unbridled 
slaughter  of  fur  seals. 

The  thirty-two-year-old  Goff  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  in  1889.  He  approached  his 
job  as  Treasury  agent  with  seriousness;  he  was  not  afraid  to  uphold  his  duties  by  taking  a 
stand.  In  1889,  he  reported  to  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  William  Windom,  his  alarm  over 
a  marked  decline  and  apparent  depletion  of  the  Pribilof  Islands  seal  herd.  His  actions  led 
to  considerable  political  intrigue  and  inspired  others  to  save  the  northern  fur  seal  from 
extinction— the  fate  encountered  by  most  of  its  cousins.  Agent  Goff  wrote: 

close  observation  . . .  revealed  the  fact  that  it  [the  decline  of  the  seal  rookeries]  was  owing 
to  the  scarcity  of  the  seals  . . .  and  as  the  killing  by  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company 
proceeded,  the  daily,  weekly,  and  monthly  receipts  were  much  smaller  than  ever  before. 

The  small  number  of  pups  killed  ...  for  food  . . . ,  and  the  alarming  decrease  in  the  daily, 
weekly,  and  monthly  receipts  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  and  as  a  dernier  [last]54 
resort  by  said  company  to  secure  their  100,000  skins  the  killing  of  smaller  seals  than  was 
customary,  attest  conclusively  . . .  that  there  is  a  scarcity  of  seals,  and  that  within  the  last 
year  or  so  they  are  from  some  cause  decreasing  far  beyond  the  increase. 

As  this  is  the  last  year  of  the  present  lease  and  there  is  a  new  lease  to  be  made,  I  would 
respectfully  suggest  that  it  is  of  vital  importance  to  the  existence  of  seal  life  that  the  annual 
quota  in  the  future  be  limited  to  the  taking  of  60,000  skins  as  the  maximum  from  the 
Pribilof  Islands.55

Biographies  G  ♦  Goff 


Goff  s  report  was  in  marked  contrast  to  the  one  given  by  his  predecessor,  George  R. 
Tingle,  in  1888  (the  same  man  who  took  issue  with  Assistant  Agent  William  Gavitt  at  St. 
George  Island  the  year  before).  Tingle  wrote  that  the  herd  was  at  least  maintaining  its  full 
number. 

I  have  made  frequent  and  close  inspections  of  the  rookeries  this  year  and  find  the  lines  of 
occupancy  extended  beyond  those  of  last  year. ...  It  is  certain,  however,  this  vast  number  of 
animals  ...  is  still  on  the  increase. 

The  number  of  seals  at  present  shown  to  be  on  the  breeding  rookeries  of  the  two  islands  is 
as  follows  -  6,357,750.56 

Oddly,  Tingle  stated  elsewhere  in  his  report:  “I  think  that  a  deduction  of  one-fourth 
from  the  above  would  show  more  nearly  correct  the  true  number  of  seals  on  the  islands.57 

The  difference  between  the  assessments  of  Tingle  in  1888  and  Goff  in  1889,  when 
the  latter  reported  that  the  ACC  encountered  difficulties  securing  its  100,000  skins,  is 
remarkable. 5s  Four  to  six  million  seals  and  they  can’t  fill  their  quota  of  100,000?  This  must 
have  been  the  question  going  through  Goff’s  mind.  Following  an  investigation  in  1890 
by  Goff  and  Henry  Elliott,  as  mentioned  below,  the  fur-seal  census  on  the  islands  totaled 
1,059,000  seals;  the  estimates  would  continue  to  fall  to  150,000  by  1903.59 

Goff’s  annual  report  for  1889,  dated  July  31,  1889,  coincided  with  the  end  of  the  seal 
harvest.  He  sent  an  unusual  supplementary  report  dated  December  23, 1889,  to  Secretary 
of  the  Treasury  Windom  from  his  home  in  Clarksburg,  West  Virginia.  The  report  con¬ 
tained  an  alarming  statement: 

From  the  first  I  was  forcibly  impressed  with  the  decrease  in  number,  taking  as  a  guide  the 
report  of  my  predecessor,  the  Hon.  George  R.  Tingle;  but  thinking  I  might  be  mistaken, 
and  not  wishing  to  sound  a  needless  alarm  to  the  Department,  I  ventured  the  suggestion  of 
taking  60,000  seals  as  the  maximum  for  the  first  five  years  of  the  new  lease,  the  number  to 
be  increased  or  decreased  as  the  Secretary  may  deem  advisable.  I  now,  without  hesitation, 
after  a  more  careful  observation  of  the  entire  situation,  think  that  my  suggestion  of  60,000 
was  too  high,  and  would  respectfully  insert  instead  50,000  as  the  maximum. ...  I  regard 
it  absolutely  essential,  for  the  future  of  the  rookeries,  that  prompt  action  be  taken  by  the 
Department  for  the  suppression  of  illegal  killing  of  seals  in  Bering  Sea,  and  that  the  utmost 
economy  be  observed  in  taking  the  seals  allowed  by  law.  There  should  be  no  killing  after 
July  20.60 

Goff’s  recommendation  did  not  sit  well  with  the  potential  new  lease-holders,  the 
NACC,  or  with  the  Harrison  administration.  Nonetheless,  he  rattled  the  cage  sufficiently 
to  bring  attention  to  the  potential  plight  of  a  significant  U.S.  revenue  source.  Congress 
legislated  to  send  an  expert  to  the  Seal  Islands  to  investigate  Goff’s  allegations.  Henry 
Wood  Elliott,  the  only  recognized  fur-seal  expert  at  the  time,  accepted  the  appointment 
from  Treasury  Secretary  Windom. 

In  the  meantime,  the  North  American  Commercial  Company  secured  the  next  twen¬ 
ty-year  lease  to  harvest  seals,  effective  May  1890,  and  the  ACC  transferred  its  property 
on  the  islands  to  the  NACC.  Secretary  Windom  directed  Charles  Goff  to  oversee  the 
transfer;  Rudolph  Neumann  for  the  ACC  and  George  R.  Tingle  for  the  NACC  conducted 
inventories  and  appraised  the  value  of  property.61  Two  days  after  the  inventory  had  been 
completed  on  both  islands,  and  settlement  concluded,  Nathan  Goff  Jr.  arrived  “to  remain 


275 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


during  the  season.”  However,  he  stayed  for  only  two  weeks.62  Although  his  trip  was  not 
mentioned  directly  in  the  St.  Paul  Island  Treasury  Agent’s  Log,  we  might  assume  Nathan 
journeyed  to  the  Seal  Islands  to  support  his  brother  against  possible  retribution  by  the 
NACC  including  George  Tingle,  and  to  lend  his  legal  and  political  acumen  in  support  of 
the  government’s  interest. 

While  Henry  Wood  Elliott  and  Agent-in-Charge  Charles  Goff  toiled  to  protect  the 
fur  seal  from  extinction  under  their  combined  authorities,  which  were  limited  to  the  land 
harvest  alone,  a  small  number  of  influential  officials  in  the  government’s  executive  branch 
fully  recognized  the  impact  of  pelagic  sealing  on  the  size  of  the  herd — and  more  impor¬ 
tantly  to  them,  the  impact  on  the  coffers  of  the  NACC  and  the  U.S.  Treasury. 

Before  Elliott  presented  his  report  of  the  investigation,  Goff  submitted  three  signifi¬ 
cant  findings.  The  first: 

1.  With  this  undeniable  decrease  in  merchantable  seals,  and  knowing  the  impoverished 
conditions  of  the  rookeries  and  hauling  grounds,  and  believing  it  to  be  inimical  to  the  best 
interests  of  the  Government  to  extend  the  time  for  killing  beyond  July  20, 1  adhered  to  the 
letter  and  spirit  of  your  instructions  to  me  and  closed  the  killing  season  July  20,  against  the 
bitter  protestations  of  Mr.  George  R.  Tingle,  general  manager  for  the  lessees.63 

Goff  enclosed  Tingle’s  protest,  which  included  the  following: 

The  law  says  the  lessees  shall  give  the  natives  a  maintenance  out  of  the  taking  of  the  seal 
skins.  How  can  that  provision  of  the  law  be  carried  out  when  the  Government  steps  in 
and  stops  the  lessees  from  killing  when  they  are  taking  a  thousand  seals  a  day?  By  the 
enforcement  of  your  order  . . .  you  deprive  the  natives  of  a  maintenance;  you  deprive  the 
Government  of  large  revenue;  or  cause  the  North  American  Commercial  Company  great 
loss;  you  turn  over  to  the  marauders  and  other  natural  enemies  of  the  seals  in  the  water 
many  thousands  of  fine,  killable,  merchantable  seals,  which  we  could  take  without  any 
detriment  whatever  to  the  rookeries. 

We  have  every  reason  to  believe,  from  the  marked  increase  of  new  arrivals  of  seals,  that 
if  we  were  allowed,  by  you  to  continue  our  killing  under  the  law  we  could  fill  our  quota  of 
60,000  seals.64 

By  July  20,  1890,  the  NACC  had  killed  only  21,357  seals,65  whereas  the  year  before  the 
total  killed  by  the  ACC  by  July  20  reached  100, 135, 66  and  the  ACC  had  struggled  to  reach 
that  number.  The  average  number  of  seals  killed  per  day  of  harvest  in  1890  was  522;  in 
1889  the  average  was  1,974.67  Tingle’s  arguments  for  extending  the  harvest  season  to  July 
31,  as  provided  by  law,  with  the  prospect  of  the  NACC  reaching  a  quota  of  60,000 — never 
mind  100,000 — lacked  credibility. 

Goff’s  other  two  findings  were  stated  thus: 

2. 1  respectfully  suggest  that  there  be  no  killing  of  fur  seals  for  their  skins  on  these  islands, 
nor  in  the  waters  of  Bering  Sea,  for  an  indefinite  number  of  years,  to  be  named  by  the 
Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  and  let  nature  take  her  course  in  replenishing  the  rookeries.68 

3.  The  limited  number  of  seals  killed  this  season  by  the  lessees  will  undoubtedly  leave  the 
majority  of  the  natives  in  absolute  want,  and  their  condition  will  appeal  to  the  Department 
for  aid. 

The  amount  distributed  to  the  natives  upon  the  islands  of  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  was 
$6,783.30  and  $1,644.80,  respectively.  This  will  not  be  sufficient  to  provide  them  with  the 


276 


Biographies  G  ♦  Goff 


necessaries  of  life  until  the  steamers  return  in  the  spring,  especially  so  with  the  natives  of 
St.  George  Island. 

The  Department  will  have  to  make  some  provision  for  the  support  and  maintenance  of 
these  people,  as  their  mode  of  making  a  living  has  been  destroyed  for  the  present,  and  the 
future  is  only  what  the  charity  of  the  Government  will  make  it.  There  is  utterly  nothing 
here  upon  which  they  can  depend  for  a  livelihood  until  the  much  wished-for  return  of  seals 
takes  place,  an  event  too  far  in  the  future  to  give  even  a  promise  of  better  times  to  these 
unfortunate  people.69 

Historian  G.  Wayne  Smith  correctly  recognized  a  “skirmish”  between  Stephen  B. 
Elkins,  social  and  financial  friend  of  the  NACC,  and  the  Goffs,  one  that  later  cost  Charles 
Goff  his  position  as  government  agent  on  the  Pribilof  Islands.  Nathan  Goff  Jr.  was  a  po¬ 
litical  foe  of  Stephen  B.  Elkins,  who  was  appointed  by  the  Harrison  Administration  as 
Secretary  of  War  in  1891  and,  as  noted,  had  close  ties  with  the  NACC  (see  Elkins  biogra¬ 
phy).  Historian  Smith  wrote  in  his  book  about  Nathan  Goff  Jr.: 

One  can  imagine  that  Elkins  took  quick  advantage  of  the  defeats  Goff  suffered  [failing 
to  win  the  governorship  of  West  Virginia]  in  1888  and  1889  and  the  loss  of  the  1890 
campaign.  Elkins’  high  position  in  the  party  also  had  enabled  him  to  influence  certain 
patronage  matters  with  some  adversity  to  Goff’s  interests.70 

Agent  Goff’s  recommendation  to  bring  a  halt  to  pelagic  sealing  did  not  go  unheeded 
by  President  Harrison.  The  President,  Secretary  of  War  Elkins,  and  Secretary  of  State 
Blaine  did  their  best  to  “persuade”  the  British  to  stop  killing  seals  at  sea.  However,  while 
publicly  agreeing  that  the  land  harvest  must  also  step  back  in  intensity,  they  secret¬ 
ly  worked  the  system,  in  part  through  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  Foster,  who  replaced 
Secretary  Windom  in  1891,  to  enable  their  social  and  political  friends  of  the  NACC  to 
continue  the  land  harvest.  Normally  Elliott  reported  to  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  Foster; 
however,  when  Elliott  was  about  to  release  his  1890  report,  which  contained  damning 
information  not  only  about  pelagic  sealing  but  also  about  the  land  harvest,  Secretary  of 
State  Blaine  interceded  with  him  to  withhold  the  report,  and  Elliott  agreed.  When  word 
of  the  cabal  leaked  out  over  cocktails,  the  land  harvest  was  moderated/1  But  pelagic  seal¬ 
ing  went  full  bore  and  the  fur-seal  herd  continued  its  precipitous  decline. 

As  postulated  by  one  author,  Goff  was  quietly  relieved  of  his  position  because  of  his 
initial  whistle-blowing,  which  cost  the  NACC  its  right  to  harvest  up  to  100,000  seals  per 
annum. 

One  lost  patronage  skirmish  concerned  his  [Nathan’s]  younger  brother,  Charles  J.  Goff, 
who  had  been  appointed  as  a  Treasury  agent  to  the  Alaskan  seal  fisheries  in  1890  [1889]  by 
Secretary  of  the  Treasury  William  Windom.  In  May,  1891,  after  only  one  [two]  season[s]  he 
was  removed,  allegedly  at  the  behest  of  the  North  American  Commercial  Company,  whose 
wrath  he  had  incurred  by  recommending  a  cessation  of  the  taking  of  seals  for  one  year.72 

Charles  Goff’s  efforts  were  not  lost  on  the  news  media.  From  the  New  York  Times  in 
May  1891: 

TO  EXTERMINATE  THE  SEALS

interested  parties  about  as  readily  as  he  adopted  vagaries  of  the  Director  of  the  Mint,

Commercial  Company  to  displace  Special  Agent  Goff  from  the  supervision  of  the  sealing

Events  of  the  Year  1889.,) 


industry,  and  has  appointed  Mr.  J.  Stanley-Brown 
to  go  to  the  islands  as  his  “own  man.”  Charles  J. 
Goff  is  the  brother  of  the  Hon.  Nathan  Goff  of 
West  Virginia.  He  appears  to  have  been  honest 
and  he  was  brave  enough  to  stop  the  killing  of  the 
seals  by  the  leases  [lessees]  before  they  had  taken 
the  number  allowed  to  be  killed  under  the  lease, 
because  he  saw  that  there  were  not  [sufficient] 
“killable”  seals  on  the  ground  to  justify  the  attempt 
and  he  considered  that  the  discretion  reposed  to 
him  by  the  department  ought  to  be  exercised  to 
reduce  the  quota.  He  reported  the  seals  rapidly 
diminishing,  that  young  seals  were  being  driven 
and  redrivin  [sic]  over  the  hauling  grounds,  and 
that  under-sized  seals  were  being  killed  to  make  up 
the  catch,  and  concluded  that,  “It  is  but  a  question 
of  a  few  years,  unless  immediately  attended  to, 
before  the  seal  question  of  the  Pribilof  group  of 
islands  will  be  a  thing  of  the  past.” 


Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  seals  were  looked 
upon  as  inexhaustible  and  were  officially  reported  to  be  increasing  as  late  as  1888,  the  time 
has  suddenly  come  when  experiment  and  imagination  must  cease  and  the  truth  be  told.  But 
the  friends  of  Mr.  Blaine,  for  whom  he  has  seen  fit  to  discourage  the  promised  agreement 
with  Great  Britain  do  not  love  the  truth  when  it  gets  in  their  way.  They  discredited  the  Goff 
report.  The  man  who  was  referred  to  by  Mr.  Goff  as  having  made  the  1888  report  that  the 
seals  were  increasing  was  Mr.  George  Tingle,  who  was  then  Special  Agent  of  the  Treasury. 
His  report  was  very  acceptable  to  the  Alaska  Company,  but  it  has  proved  troublesome  to 
the  State  Department,  for  the  British  people  interested  in  poaching  have  repeatedly  thrown 
Tingle’s  report  in  the  face  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  answer  his  suggestions  about  the 
importance  of  a  protective  agreement. 


Mr.  Tingle  is  now  Superintendent  of  the  North  American  Commercial  Company  and 
Mr.  Blaine’s  friends,  the  lessees,  are  now  quoting  his  flattering  report  of  the  condition  of 
the  rookeries  in  1890  to  justify  Mr.  Blaine  in  refusing  to  make  an  arrangement  for  a  close 
season.  Mr.  Goff  made  a  report  that  agrees  with  the  report  of  Prof.  Elliott,  the  substance  of 
which  is  printed  in  THE  TIMES  of  this  morning.  Being  convinced,  from  the  fact  that  nearly 
all  the  young  bull  seals  had  disappeared,  that  there  would  be  a  serious  diminution  of  the 
number  of  young  seals  at  the  rookeries  this  season,  and  a  more  noticeable  falling  off  next 
season,  he  recommended  that  there  be  no  killing  of  seals  at  the  islands  and  in  the  waters  of 
Bering  Sea  for  an  indefinite  number  of  years,  and  that  nature  be  allowed  to  take  her  course 
in  re-establishing  the  former  condition  of  the  rookeries. 


. . .  Mr.  Brown,  who  has  been  picked  out  by  Elkins  and  his  friends  to  go  to  Alaska  in  a 
revenue  cutter  to  look  at  the  rookeries,  will  probably  be  taken  in  hand  by  Mr.  George  R. 
Tingle,  who  for  reasons  reported  that  the  seals  were  increasing  in  spite  of  all  the  assaults 
upon  them,  and  he  will  make  a  report  different  from  that  made  by  Mr.  Goff,  which  has 
displeased  the  Treasury,  Mr.  Elkins,  Mr.  Blaine,  and  his  friends.  Mr.  Brown  does  not  know 
anything  about  seals.  Mr.  Elliott,  whose  report  Mr.  Blaine  has  suppressed,  and  to  whom 
some  one  near  Mr.  Blaine  seems  to  have  indulged  in  persistent  lying  for  several  months, 
is  devoted  to  the  subject  and  has  no  object  in  misrepresenting  the  true  situation  of  affairs. 
He  says  that  there  has  been  no  thought  of  taking  the  Russians  into  the  agreement,  for  the 
reason  that  there  is  no  occasion  to  do  so.  The  poachers  were  all  Americans  or  British,  and 
some  times  Americans  under  the  British  flag,  and  that  the  co-operation  of  Great  Britain 
and  the  United  States  to  stop  sealing  would  stop  it  all  in  Bering  Sea,  except  at  the  Russian 
grounds  under  lease.

As  soon  as  the  North  American  Commercial  Company’s  vessel  has  left  Sitka  and  the 
“Free-for-all”  seal  season  has  become  inevitable,  it  is  probable  that  Mr.  Blaine  will  be  heard 
shouting  lustily  in  condemnation  of  the  British  refusal  to  agree  to  a  close  season.  He  will 
be  fully  aware  that  it  will  be  too  late  to  do  anything  then  to  stop  the  indiscriminate  killing 
and  particularly  to  stop  the  killing  by  the  lessees  of  seals  that  ought  to  be  protected  if  the 
species  is  to  be  perpetuated.  Prof.  Elliott  says  that  while  the  slaughter  by  the  poachers  is 
great,  it  is  not  so  destructive  of  possible  future  seals  as  the  legalized  killing  on  the  Pribilof 
Islands.  The  suggestion  thrown  out  by  Mr.  Blaine  that  the  interference  of  the  Treasury  in 
the  business  of  the  lessees  may  involve  the  Government  in  suits  for  damages  is  one  of  the 
arguments  put  forward  in  all  of  the  Blaine  versions  of  this  story,  and  seems  to  have  been  in 
the  mind  of  Mr.  Tingle  when  he  protested  last  July  against  the  stopping  by  Mr.  Goff  of  the 
slaughter  of  small  seals.73 

However,  Charles  Goff’s  courageous  efforts  appeared  then  to  drop  below  the  radar  of 
recognition  until  eminent  fur-seal  biologist  Victor  B.  Scheffer  commented  in  1984: 

Thus  Goff,  with  Elliott’s  blessing,  pioneered  in  1890  the  practice  of  closing  the  sealing 
season  when  field  conditions  warrant  it,  in  advance  of  a  prescribed  date."4

Genealogy 

Nicolas  Gray  was  born  during  March  1861  in 
Russia.  Both  of  his  parents  were  of  Russian  de¬ 
scent.  Gray’s  wife,  Maria  (surname  unknown), 
was  born  in  Alaska  in  January  1884  to  a  German 
father  and  Alaskan  mother.  5 

Biography 

Nicolas  Gray  emigrated  from  Russia  to  America 
in  1874  and  settled  in  San  Francisco,  California. 
He  first  traveled  to  Unalaska,  Alaska,  from  San 
Francisco  in  May  of  1880,  as  a  teacher  in  the 
employ  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company.  In 
1883,  the  company  transferred  Gray  to  St.  Paul 
Island,  where  he  remained  as  a  schoolteacher 
until  the  spring  of  1890;  at  that  time  the  company 
sent  him  back  to  Unalaska  to  work  as  a  clerk  and 
storekeeper. 

In  1887,  Nicholas  Gray  helped  form  and  lead 
a  St.  Paul  Island  band,  and  in  1896,  he  formed  a 
brass  band  at  Unalaska.  He  worked  as  a  clerk  for 
the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  until  at  least 
1906.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


The  U.S.  Census  for  1910  showed  Gray  living  in  San  Francisco  at  the  same  residence 
as  89-year-old  Eugene  Cox,  former  vice-president  of  the  North  American  Commercial 
Company.76 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Nicolas  Gray  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  aboard  the  steamer  St.  Paul  on  May  31,  1883, 
as  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company’s  new  teacher  for  the  island  children,  replacing  a 
Mr.  Atkins.77  Gray  was  fully  bilingual  in  Russian  and  English  and  was  considered  a  good 
teacher,  according  to  the  government  agents,  who  reported  that  the  children  loved  him. 

School  commenced  today  [September  3,  1883]  with  54  children  in  attendance  14  boys  and 
40  girls.  At  the  request  of  the  Priest,  Fridays  of  each  week  [are]  to  be  devoted  to  teaching 
the  Russian  language  by  some  one  selected  by  the  Priest.  Mondays,  Tuesdays,  Wednesdays, 
and  Thursdays  are  for  teaching  the  English  language  five  hours  each  day:  three  hours  in  the 
forenoon  and  two  hours  in  the  afternoon;  instead  of  two  hours  each  day  for  five  days  in  the 
week  as  has  been  the  custom  heretofore.78 

The  school  closed  today  [May  8,  1884].  The  closing  exercises  were  witnessed  by  the 
Treasury  Agent,  A.C.  Co’s.  Agent,  the  resident,  the  priest,  George  Butrin  [Aleut  Chief] 
and  Mrs.  Melovedoff.  The  exercises  consisted  of  reading,  recitations  of  poetry  and  a  few 
questions  in  geography.  The  reading  was  very  good  indeed  with  the  exception  of  one  or 
two  of  the  older  scholars,  but  little  attention  was  paid  to  the  pauses,  was  read  very  rapidly. 

The  questions  in  geography  were  all  answered  satisfactorily,  and  without  hesitation.  The 
recitations  in  poetry  were  good,  without  prompting  but  very  indistinct.  There  is  a  marked 
improvement  in  the  school  in  the  lessons  and  in  the  confidence  of  the  children  in  reciting.79 

As  years  progressed,  so  did  the  island  children  under  Gray’s  instruction.  An  1887 
entry  in  the  Agent’s  Log  recognized  Gray’s  accomplishments. 

There  has  been  a  large  improvement  with  the  school  this  term;  the  condition  of  the 
children  as  to  cleanliness,  promptness  in  attending,  the  order  and  discipline;  but  very 
seldom  a  pupil  has  been  absent  or  tardy  without  a  good  and  sufficient  cause;  to  all 
appearance  it  has  been  a  pleasure  to  the  children  to  be  in  the  schoolroom  with  their 
teacher.  Mr.  Gray  has  been  very  much  interested  in  his  school  and  to  him  large  credit  is  due 
for  the  prosperous  condition  of  the  school;  he  appears  to  have  the  confidence  and  love  of 
all  the  children,  prompt  in  every  duty  as  a  teacher,  kind  and  courteous  to  all  and  he  has  the 
confidence  and  love  of  all  his  scholars  and  from  love  and  respect  they  seem  to  obey;  should 
Mr.  Gray  continue  to  be  their  teacher,  not  many  years  will  pass  before  some  of  them  will  be 
able  to  teach  their  own  school.80 

An  entry  in  the  1887  log  also  reported  the  outstanding  introduction  of  the  St.  Paul 
Island  Band  in  the  fall  of  that  year. 

During  the  fall  of  1887  and  1888,  the  following  named  persons  paid  the  amounts  set 
opposite  their  names  to  Mr.  N.  Gray  for  the  purchasing  of  several  musical  instruments  and 
music  for  a  band  for  the  Island  of  St.  Paul.  Said  instruments  and  music  to  remain  upon 
this  island  and  any  of  the  natives  that  wish  to  play  can  do  so.  Also  any  of  the  white  people 
and  the  instruments  are  the  property  of  the  band  whoever  they  may  be  from  time  to  time 
composed  of  native  and  any  of  the  white  people  who  come  to  use  them.

malfeasance  and  abuse  of  the  Aleuts  in  her  A  Century  of  Servitude:  Pribilof  Aleuts  under  U.S.  Rule 
(Washington,  DC:  Univ.  Press  of  America).  The  H.R.  no.  3883  report  dealt  with  similar  allegations, 
but  only  during  Gavitt’s  year  at  St.  George  Island  (May  1887  through  Aug.  1888),  while  Jones  held 
it  up  as  evidence  for  nearly  a  century  of  events.  In  the  1940s,  author  and  Aleut  civil-rights  advocate 
Fredericka  Martin  characterized  Agent  Tingle  as  an  “arrogant”  and  "pompous  and  egoistical  man”

Hahn,  Walter  L.  (1879-1911) 

Scientific  Assistant,  Naturalist,  U.S.  Bureau  of  Fisheries,  St.  Paul  Island,  1910 
Genealogy 

Walter  L.  Hahn  was  born  at  Bascom,  Indiana,  on  May  20,  1879,  to  German  immigrant 
parents.  Walter  Hahn  married  schoolteacher  Alta  F.  Ives  on  June  14,  1910,  at  South  Bend, 
St.  Joseph  County,  Indiana.  Walter  Hahn  died  at  St.  Paul  Island  on  May  31,  1911;  Alta 
Hahn  left  the  islands  for  Portage,  Indiana,  where  she  became  a  school  principal.1 

Biographical  Sketch 

Walter  Hahn  was  educated  in  Indiana  schools.  He  graduated  in  1903  from  Indiana 
University  with  an  AB  degree  and  took  a  position  as  an  aide  for  the  U.S.  National  Museum. 
He  became  a  scientific  assistant  for  the  Department  of  Agriculture  in  1905,  and  in  1908, 
he  received  a  PhD  in  zoology  from  Indiana  University.  Thereafter,  he  served  as  a  scientific 
assistant  in  the  Department  of  Commerce  and  Labor,  Bureau  of  Fisheries.  Immediately 
before  his  assignment  as  naturalist  on  the  Pribilof  Islands,  Hahn  taught  biology  at  the 
State  Normal  School  in  Springfield,  South  Dakota.2 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Dr.  Walter  L.  Hahn  was  the  first  full-time  naturalist  stationed  on  the  Seal  Islands.  The 
U.S.  government  created  the  naturalist  position  when  it  assumed  full  management  and 
administrative  responsibilities  following  the  expiration  of  the  final  twenty-year  lease  to 
North  American  Commercial  Company  on  May  1, 1910.  Hahn’s  annual  salary  was  $3,000. 

Dr.  Hahn  entered  upon  his  duties  as  naturalist  in  the  fall  of  1910.  His  training,  wide  field 
experience,  and  well-known  ability  and  enthusiasm  as  a  zoologist  and  practical  business 
man  were  assurance  that  his  appointment  to  the  position  of  naturalist,  just  established, 
would  prove  a  wise  selection.  His  report,  written  up  to  the  very  day  of  his  death,  shows  that 


287 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


he  possessed  a  remarkably  clear  understanding  of  the  problems  with  which  he  had  to  deal. 

Arriving  at  the  islands  August  23,  1910,  he  made  daily  observation  and  study  of  the  seals 
and  foxes  throughout  the  fall,  winter,  and  spring.  He  also  gave  attention  to  the  birds  and 
other  animals  on  and  about  the  islands,  to  the  plants,  and  to  meteorological  phenomena, 
and  gave  much  thought  to  the  local  educational  problems  and  the  intellectual  and  moral 
well-being  of  the  natives,  working  out  a  system  of  education  such  as  he  believed  best 
adapted  to  their  needs.3 

What  began  as  a  pleasant  outing  one  day  just  months  after  his  arrival  on  the  island 
ended  in  the  deaths  of  Walter  Hahn  and  a  companion. 

On  May  31,  1911,  a  distressing  accident  occurred  on  St.  Paul  Island.  Dr.  Harry  D. 

Chichester,  assistant  agent,  and  Dr.  Walter  L.  Hahn,  the  naturalist  on  the  seal  islands,  with 
their  wives  and  a  native,  Neon  Tetof  [sic],  while  sailing  on  the  lagoon  were  unable  to  put 
about  successfully  in  the  high  wind  and  by  the  capsizing  of  their  boat  were  exposed  to  the 
ice-cold  water  for  more  than  an  hour.  All  were  alive  when  rescued,  and  Mrs.  Chichester 
and  Mrs.  Hahn,  by  the  diligent  efforts  of  the  physician  were  resuscitated.  The  native  also 
survived,  but  Dr.  Chichester  and  Dr.  Hahn,  necessarily  left  without  medical  attention  for  a 
time,  succumbed  to  the  effects  of  the  exposure.4 

Additional  details  about  the  accident  are  provided  in  the  Chichester  and  Neon  Tetoff 
biographies. 


Hajny,  Richard  (1921-2004) 

Resident  Biologist,  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service,  Bureau  of  Commercial  Fisheries,  St. 
Paul  Island,  1 964-1 970 

Genealogy 

Richard  Hajny  was  born  on  May  20,  1921,  in  Fairfield,  Nebraska,  to  Frank  Willard  Hajny 
and  Mary  B.  (Mazour)  Hajny.  Richard  met  nurse  Dixie  Alene  West  in  Wrangell,  Alaska, 
where  they  married  on  May  26,  1948  at  St.  Rose  of  Lima  Church.5  Richard  and  Dixie 
Hajny  raised  three  children  on  St.  Paul  Island:  Francis  (Frank),  Phyllis,  and  Matthew. 
Richard  Hajny  died  in  Seattle  on  February  8,  2004.  Dixie  Hajny  died  on  April  18,  2006. 

Biographical  Sketch 

Richard  Hajny  first  traveled  to  Alaska  in  1939  while  serving  with  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  in 
Southeast  Alaska.  After  WWII,  he  attended  Oregon  State  University  and  worked  sum¬ 
mers  as  a  research  biologist  in  the  Aleutians  for  the  Bureau  of  Commercial  Fisheries.  On 
St.  Paul  Island,  his  wife,  Dixie,  served  the  community  in  her  capacity  as  a  registered  nurse 
and  even,  when  the  need  arose,  as  the  island’s  doctor.  Their  daughter,  Phyllis,  returned  to 
St.  Paul  Island  during  adulthood  and  married  Simeon  Swetzof,  who  is  (in  2008)  Mayor 
of  the  City  of  St.  Paul.  Phyllis  became  active  in  civic  affairs  and  serves  as  St.  Paul  City 
Clerk.6

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Richard  "Dick”  Hajny  arrived  in  the  Pribilofs  in 
1964  and  served  as  the  Bureau  of  Commercial 
Fisheries’  first  resident  biologist  on  the  islands; 
his  job  was  to  record  the  movements  of  reindeer, 
foxes  and  seals.  Up  to  that  time  the  resident  man¬ 
agers,  although  biologists,  did  not  undertake  any 
scientific  endeavors.  Hajny  resided  on  St.  Paul 
Island  from  1964  until  August  1967,  when  his 
position  was  relocated  to  Seattle.  However,  he 
continued  to  work  summers  in  the  Pribilofs  and 
spent  the  off-season  in  the  Seattle  office.  In  1966, 
he  was  instrumental  in  the  conversion  of  seal- 
pelt  blubbering  from  manual  labor  to  mechani¬ 
cal  means.  The  increase  in  efficiency  led  to  lower 
production  cost,  but  at  the  expense  of  jobs,  al¬ 
though  many  of  the  job  losses  affected  only  those 
who  came  to  the  islands  solely  for  employment 
during  the  summer  seal  harvest.  Hajny  resided  in 
the  island  community  during  the  passage  of  the 
Fur-Seal  Act  of  1966.  He  served  as  biologist  until 
his  retirement  in  1970. 7 


On  October  3,  1970,  just  before  Hajny’s  re¬ 
tirement,  the  Bureau  of  Commercial  Fisheries  was 
renamed  the  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service, 
and  transferred  from  the  Department  of  the 
Interior  to  the  Department  of  Commerce  , within 
Commerce’s  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric 
Administration. 


Although  retired  from  government  service, 

Richard  and  Dixie  Hajny  remained  involved 
with  the  Pribilof  Islands.  Together  they  returned 
to  provide  wildlife  presentations  and  served  as 
guides  to  summer  tour  groups.  Richard  Hajny 
was  recognized  for  his  ivory  craftsmanship.8  In  2008,  the  family  of  Richard  and  Dixie 
Hajny  “cast  their  ashes  over  Southwest  Point  so  that  they  may  remain  forever  on  St.  Paul 
Island.”9

Haley,  George  and  Cora  (1870-1954  and  1872-1931) 

Teachers,  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce,  St.  George  Island,  1914-1915 

Genealogy 

George  Haley  was  born  November  28,  1870,  to 
stonemason  William  Smith  Haley  and  Lucinda  Ellen 
(Gray)  Haley  of  Brownfield,  Maine.  On  February  26, 
1906,  George  married  Cora  M.  Giles  in  Brownfield, 
Maine.  Cora,  born  February  19,  1872,  was  the  daugh¬ 
ter  of  Mary  E.  (Snow)  Giles  and  Loring  R.  Giles,  a 
Brownfield  dry  goods  merchant.  As  newlyweds, 
George  and  Cora  traveled  to  Japan  just  two  weeks 
before  the  San  Francisco  earthquake  in  April  1906. 
Cora  Haley  passed  away  in  Berkeley,  California, 
on  December  4,  1931. 10  George  Haley  died  at  San 
Francisco  in  1954. 

Biographical  Sketch 

George  Haley  graduated  in  1891  from  Fryeburg 
Academy,  Fryeburg,  Maine. He  earned  a  Bachelor  of 
Science  degree  in  1911  from  the  University  of  Maine 
and  in  1928  a  Doctor  of  Philosophy  in  biology  from 
the  University  of  San  Francisco  (St.  Ignatius  College). 
He  would  later  head  the  university’s  biology  depart¬ 
ment.  Cora  Giles  was  a  normal  school  graduate  and 
became  a  teacher.11 

George  Haley  was  brought  up  on  a  farm  where  he  developed  the  lifetime  love  for 
flora  and  fauna  that  ultimately  made  him  famous  on  several  continents.  Dr.  Whitman  G. 
Stickney,  a  childhood  cohort,  wrote,  “He  was  a  born  teacher  whose  influence  extended 
far  beyond  the  classroom  . . .  everywhere  he  went  he  imparted  information  to  young  and 
old,  with  a  contagious  enthusiasm.”12  Dr.  Haley  also  taught  English  and  mathematics  at 
the  Japanese  Naval  College,  Tokyo.13 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

George  and  Cora  Haley  succeeded  G  Dallas  Hanna  and  his  wife  as  teachers  on  St.  George 
Island,  beginning  September  26,  1914.  George  Haley  taught  the  senior  students  while 
Cora  worked  with  those  of  kindergarten  age  (Junior  School),  as  well  as  teaching  older 
girls  in  sewing  classes.  Although  the  school  had  recently  been  enlarged  and  remodeled 
when  the  Haleys  began  teaching,  it  remained  a  one-room  schoolhouse.  A  strong  empha¬ 
sis  was  placed  upon  the  teaching  of  English,  a  language  still  not  widely  accepted  by  the 
Native  communities  in  the  Pribilofs  thirty-eight  years  after  cession  from  Russia.

The  Haleys  wrote  a  long  report  at  the  end  of 
the  school  year  on  May  26,  1915.  Only  excerpts 
made  it  into  the  agency’s  annual  report,  and  the 
even  shorter  excerpts  given  here  are  meant  as 
representations  of  their  devotion  to  teaching. 
Their  report  attempted  to  communicate  their 
perception  of  the  educational  shortfalls  on  the 
island  along  with  their  apparently  sincere  at¬ 
tempts  to  overcome  them.

One  of  the  greatest  obstacles  in  the  progress  of 
the  pupils  here  is  the  fact  that  they  do  not  speak 
English.  With  one  or  two  exceptions,  English 
is  spoken  in  none  of  the  homes,  so  when  the 
child  comes  to  school  at  the  age  of  six  years 
his  vocabulary  is  usually  limited  to  the  words, 

“good-by,”  “yes,”  and  “no”  It  is  not  difficult  for  a 
child  to  acquire  a  working  knowledge  of  a  foreign 
tongue  under  the  proper  conditions.  Many  of  the 

children  of  the  foreign-born  citizens  of  the  United  States  hear  only  their  native  tongue  in 
their  homes;  but  when  they  enter  the  public  schools  not  only  the  language  of  the  school  but 
the  language  of  the  playground  is  English,  and  the  playground  is  where  the  child  gets  the 
greater  part  of  his  practice  in  speaking.  It  is  in  free  conversation  that  one  learns  to  think  in 
a  foreign  tongue.  Such  children  usually  are  desirous  of  speaking  English — it  may  be  with 
no  higher  motive  than  because  “the  others  do” — and  the  parents  encourage  progress  in 
English,  feeling  that  whatever  line  of  work  the  children  will  follow  after  leaving  school  it 
will  be  an  aid  in  their  advancement.  Here  the  conditions  are  very  different — the  medium 
of  communication  of  the  playground  is  Aleut,  so  as  soon  as  the  threshold  of  the  school 
building  is  passed  there  is  no  attempt  to  speak  English.  Then  apparently  the  parents  feel  no 
interest  in  their  children  speaking  English.  It  may  be  that  they  see  no  advantage  in  it. 


. . .  Objects  familiar  to  the  children  and  animal  and  plant  life  of  the  island  have  been  made 
subjects  of  the  language  lessons  both  for  oral  and  written  work.  Some  games  have  been 
taught  the  children  in  the  hope  that  the  English  words  used  would  become  common  in 
their  undirected  plays.  When  the  weather  permitted,  a  short  walk  was  a  part  of  the  daily 
program  for  the  little  ones,  during  which  time  an  endeavor  was  always  made  that  the 
conversation  should  be  in  English,  thus  names  of  out-of-door  objects  and  actions  have  been 
acquired  without  a  conscious  effort.  During  the  last  of  the  spring  months,  nature  lessons 
have  been  given,  not  only  that  the  children  might  have  some  knowledge  of  animals  and 
plants  of  the  island  but  also  as  a  means  of  cultivating  the  power  of  observation.14 

The  Haleys  remained  on  St.  George  Island  for  one  school  year  before  transferring  to 
St.  Paul  Island,  where  George  taught  school  for  five  more  years  and  Cora  for  four.  The 
agent’s  annual  report  for  the  1915-16  school  year  on  St.  Paul  commended  the  Haleys’ 
educational  progress. 


Special  effort  was  made  to  have  the  children  speak  and  read  English  and  to  think  in  that 
language,  and  much  ingenuity  was  displayed  by  the  teachers  in  their  efforts  to  secure  the 
desired  results.  Attention  was  given  to  the  health  of  the  pupils  and  gymnastics  were  made 
a  part  of  the  regular  program.  Music,  games,  and  nature-study  work  were  interspersed 
with  the  more  formal  phases  of  school  routine.  The  increased  facility  in  the  use  of  English 
on  the  part  of  the  children,  and  the  marked  improvement  in  their  conduct  and  general 
appearance,  have  been  made  the  subject  of  very  favorable  comment.15

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People  

Dr.  Haley  was  also  an  avid  naturalist  who  endeavored  to  understand  the  Seal  Islands’ 
natural  history.  The  following  excerpts  were  taken  from  the  field  notes  of  Dr.  George 
Haley  as  obtained  from  the  Special  Collections  of  the  California  Academy  of  Sciences. 
He  gathered  these  notes  while  holding  his  teaching  position  on  the  Pribilof  Islands.  In 
his  notes,  Dr.  Haley  did  not  italicize  or  underline  species  names  and  several  species  were 
either  misspelled  or  incorrectly  identified. 

FIELD  NOTES  ON  THE  COMMON  PLANTS 
OF  THE  PRIBILOF  ISLANDS 

On  the  treeless  slopes  of  the  Pribilof  Islands,  spring 
and  autumn  clasp  hands.  When  the  drift  ice  passes 
away,  the  fogs  surround  the  hills  and  valleys.  Dr. 

C.H.  Merriman,  of  the  Bering  Sea  Commissioners, 
gives  a  concise  description  of  the  natural  features. 

. .  .“In  summer  the  islands  are  almost  constantly 
enveloped  in  fog.  The  atmosphere  is  saturated  (the 
wet  and  dry  bulbs  registering  the  same)  and  the 
temperature  is  uniformly  low,  the  thermometer 
ranging  from  45  to  48  degrees  F.  or  rarely  to  50 
degrees  F.” 

The  sand  dunes  abound  with  Cochlearia 
officinalis,  Arenaria  peploides,  Lathrus  maritinus 
[sic],  Mertensia  maritina  [sic]  and  one  species 
of  Polemonium.  On  the  cliffs  are  found  Draba 
hirta,  Arabis  ambigua,  Sagina  linnaei,  and 
Saxifraga  bracteata.  Near  the  villages  will  be 
found  Ranunculus  hyperboreus,  Ranunculus 
reptans  (in  ponds)  and  Chrysanthemum  articum 
(edge  of  bogs).  In  the  bogs  may  be  found  Rubus 
chamaemorus,  Pedicularis  sudetica,  and  Palasites 
[sic]  frigida.  On  the  grassy  slopes  of  the  uplands 
are  found  the  mats  of  Silene  acaulis,  Arenaria 
macrocaspa  [sic]  Pursh,  and  Eritrichium 
chamissonis. 

The  yellow  acres  of  poppies  and  blue  valleys  of  lupines  are  characteristic  of  the  landscape. 

The  heaths  are  pink  with  the  figworts,  Pedicularis  langsdorfii,  and  blue  patches  of  blue  bells 
abound.  The  “Poochka”  (Umbelliferae)  is  the  largest  of  any  plant  on  the  islands,  the  foxes 
can  hide  in  the  masses  of  vegetation.  The  natives  eat  the  stalks  early  in  the  spring. 

The  plants  are  in  a  constant  dilemma;  to  be  conspicuous  to  the  insects  in  order  to  be 
fertilized;  to  be  inconspicuous  in  raising  their  heads  in  the  face  of  wind  and  weather.  Hence, 
the  brilliant  masses  of  color  and  the  low  mats  of  vegetation. 

The  indigenous  species  have,  as  a  rule,  minute  seeds.  Because  of  their  small  size  they  might 
have  been  carried  on  the  feet  of  aquatic  birds  or  in  their  alimentary  canals.  The  drift  ice 
in  winter  and  the  high  winds  would  possibly  carry  other  seeds.  It  is  significant  that  a  new 
volcanic  island  (Bogoslof)  south  of  the  Pribilofs,  had  some  grass  and  a  few  primroses  only 
three  years  after  being  raised  above  the  water. 

An  iris  (Iris  setosa)  has  recently  been  found  near  the  site  of  the  old  Russian  village,  west 
of  North  Rookery,  St.  George  and  the  geranium  at  Whitney  Pond,  St.  Paul  may  have  been 
introduced  from  Unalaska  where  both  species  are  abundant.  Since  the  above  writing,  the 
writer  has  been  on  St.  Paul  again  (1925)  and  found  G.  erianthum  growing  abundantly  on 
north  slope  of  Lake  Hill.

Biographies  H  ♦  Haley 


George  Haley  ended  his  service  in  the  island  schools  at  the  close  of  the  1920  school 
year.lb  Cora  Haley  resigned  from  teaching  on  St.  Paul  Island  in  1919  and  spent  the  early 
part  of  1920  with  her  mother  and  brother  in  Brownfield,  Maine,  as  noted  in  the  1920  U.S. 
Census. 

When  Mrs.  Haley  was  dying  in  1931,  she  asked  that  she  be  buried  on  far  off  St.  Paul’s  Island 
of  the  Pribilofs  among  the  rocks  they  both  loved  so  much.  Mrs.  Haley’s  ashes  were  flown 
to  St.  Paul  Island  where  they  were  inurned  deep  in  a  rock  crevice  close  to  the  shore  where 
wind-lashed  waves  will  wash  back  and  forth  until  an  H-bomb  war  possibly  changes  the  flow 
of  tides.17 

Sorrowful  natives,  some  her  former  students,  conducted  a  burial  service  for  her  in  the 
[rites]  of  the  Greek  Catholic  faith.  From  that  day  until  the  Aleuts  living  there  were  taken 
to  the  Alaskan  coast  for  their  own  safety  when  war  came  even  to  their  barren  waste  land, 
hardy  wild  flowers  were  kept  growing  near  the  little  stone  slab  bearing  the  name,  “Mrs. 

Cora  Giles  Haley.”  After  the  war  ended  the  natives  returned,  new  flowers  were  planted. 

George’s  last  request  was  that  his  ashes  be  buried  beside  his  wife’s  grave  on  St.  Paul  Island.18 

Karl  W.  Kenyon,  seal  biologist  with  the  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service,  received  Dr.  Haley’s 
ashes  on  September  9,  1954,  at  St.  Paul  Island.  The  following  is  an  excerpt  from  his  kindly 
letter  to  Dr.  Robert  C.  Miller,  Director  of  the  California  Academy  of  Sciences. 

Dr.  Haley’s  ashes  reached  the  Pribilofs  shortly  before  I  left;  thus  I  was  not  on  hand  for  the 
funeral. ...  I  did  speak  briefly  to  one  of  the  natives  who  was  present  at  the  funeral.  Mr. 

Roy  Hurd,  who  was  at  that  time  Agent  in  charge  of  St.  Paul  Island,  was  the  government 
representative  who  witnessed  the  burial.  Two  natives  who  had  known  Dr.  Haley,  Gabriel 
Stepatin,  and  Elary  Gromoff,  were  also  present  and  Elary  told  me  that  a  small  metal  plaque 
was  inscribed  to  mark  the  grave,  which  is  near  Kamenista.19 

In  1960,  after  a  forty-year  absence,  naturalist  G  Dallas  Hanna  revisited  St.  Paul  Island 
(as  discussed  below  in  his  biography).  Dr.  Hanna  was  a  friend  of  the  Haleys  and  was 
requested  to  place  a  more  durable,  engraved  plaque  at  their  resting  place  by  Kamanista.

‘You  can  drive  there  in  ten  minutes,’  and  he  was  right!”20  The  above  photographs  taken

ment  Agent’s  Log.  G  and  Rosanna  had  one  daughter,  Edna,  born  on  St.  Paul  Island  in 
1915.  Elizabeth  served  as  a  teacher  during  her  years  on  the  islands.  G  Hanna’s  second 
marriage  was  to  Margaret  Scott  Moore  (September  4,  1906-1997),  born  in  Orange, 
Franklin  County,  Massachusetts.  Margaret  was  the  daughter  of  dairyman  John  Moore  and 
Grace  M.  (Perkins)  Moore.21  G  Dallas  Hanna  died  November  29,  1970  at  San  Francisco, 
California.22 

Biographical  Sketch 

G  Dallas  Hanna’s  first  field  position,  following 
graduation  from  the  University  of  Kansas,  took 
him  as  an  employee  of  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Fisheries 
to  Alaska’s  Bristol  Bay  area  in  the  spring  of  1911. 

His  apparent  mission  was: 

to  find  out  everything  he  could  about  the  fisheries, 
aquatic  biology,  and  miscellaneous  wildlife 
resources  of  the  area. . . . 

In  the  winter  of  1912-13  he  made  a  historic  trip 
of  a  thousand  miles  by  dog  sled,  from  the  head  of 
Bristol  Bay  to  Idadorod  [sic]  and  return. ...  He 
collected  800  birds  and  mammals  for  the  United 
States  National  Museum. ...  All  that  science 
needed  was  the  skin  and  skulls.  The  meat  he 
apportioned  between  himself  and  his  sled  dogs. . . . 

His  new  assignment  [1913-1920]  was  to  the 
Pribilof  Islands,  more  remote  and  wet  and  cold 
and  fog-bound  even  than  Bristol  Bay.  Here 
he  kept  count  of  the  Alaskan  fur  seal-herd  . . . 
and  formed  lasting  friendships  with  the  local 
human  inhabitants,  both  Aleuts  and  the  few 
resident  whites,  through  his  interest  in  them 
and  his  ingenuity  in  suggesting  new  solutions 
to  the  particular  problems  of  an  inhospitable 
environment. 

In  addition  to  his  duties  as  custodian  and  census-taker  of  the  fur  seals  on  their  breeding 
grounds,  Dr.  Hanna  studied  the  general  natural  history  of  the  Pribilofs  and  published 
papers  on  both  the  birds  and  the  mammals.  He  also  interested  himself  in  the  geology  and 
paleontology  of  the  islands,  and  took  up  the  study  of  fossil  diatoms — a  specialty  that  was  to 
play  an  important  role  in  his  subsequent  career. . . . 

Dr.  Hanna’s  interest  in  microfossils  . . .  began  in  1916  when  working  on  a  fossil  diatom 
deposit  on  St.  Paul  Island;  he  designed  a  new  type  of  “mechanical  finger”  clamped  to  his 
microscope  for  greater  ease  in  handling  and  mounting  individual  diatom  specimens  for 
study.  This  is  still  the  best  apparatus  available  for  such  extremely  delicate  work  and  is  in 
constant  use  today.23 

In  a  fifty-year  career,  Hanna  became  recognized  as  a  leading  paleontologist  and  in¬ 
ventor  of  equipment  for  scientific  research.  He  served  as  director  of  the  Naval  Arctic 
Research  Laboratory  at  Point  Barrow  (1955-57)  and  continued  his  research  in  the  arctic 
throughout  his  life.  He  conducted  geological  field  explorations  for  the  National  Academy 
of  Sciences.  He  introduced  the  use  of  microfossils  for  the  identification  of  oil-bearing

strata  (Reiber-Hanna,  patent  no.  1,665,058.  April  13,  1928).  At  the  California  Academy 
of  Sciences  he  led  a  team  that  designed  and  constructed  the  Morrison  Planetarium  pro¬ 
jector,  at  the  time  considered  the  finest  of  its  kind  in  the  world.  He  also  worked  with 
Eastman  Kodak  Company  (1954)  in  the  development  of  a  precise  and  inexpensive  color 
printing  process.24 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

When  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce,  Bureau  of  Fisheries,  sent  G  Dallas  Hanna  to 
the  Pribilof  Island  of  St.  George  as  an  assistant  warden  and  teacher  in  1913, 25  no  one 
could  have  envisioned  the  impact  the  man  would  have  on  conserving  the  history  of  the  is¬ 
lands.  Hanna  took  numerous  photographs  of  daily  life  experiences,  the  sealing  processes, 
work  crews,  families  at  work  and  at  play,  school  children,  plant  life,  birds,  landscapes,  seal 
rookeries,  young  and  old  seals,  and  buildings  being  constructed,  moved  or  razed.  Along 
with  photographs  he  gathered  field  collections  of  biological,  geological,  and  paleonto¬ 
logical  specimens;  and  he  compiled  meticulous  notes  while  also  writing  daily  logs  on  St. 
George  and  St.  Paul  islands  (1916-1917  and  1918,  respectively). 

After  learning  that  the  St.  George  Tanaq 
Corporation  had  acquired  many  of  Hanna’s 
original  5x7  inch  and  8x10  inch  glass  plate 
negatives  of  photographs  taken  on  the  Pribilof 
Islands,  NOAA  worked  collaboratively  with 
the  Native  corporation  in  2007-2008  to  cata¬ 
logue  and  temporarily  conserve  the  negatives. 
Together,  these  entities  enlisted  the  assistance 
of  the  Anchorage  Museum  at  Rasmuson  to 
scan  the  negatives.  Subsequently,  the  nega¬ 
tives  were  transferred  along  with  electronic 
files  of  the  images  to  the  National  Archives 
and  Records  Administration,  Pacific  Alaska 
Region,  in  Anchorage,  Alaska,  for  permanent 
conservation.26  The  field  collections  are  found  largely  at  the  U.S.  National  Museum  in 
Washington,  D.C.,  and  the  California  Academy  of  Sciences  in  San  Francisco,  California. 
Nine  percent  (forty-one)  of  his  438  publications  from  1909-1961  listed  by  the  California 
Academy  of  Sciences  focused  on  the  Pribilof  Islands,  covering  the  period  1914  to  19517 
Examples  include  his  doctoral  thesis  “The  Alaskan  Fur  Seal”  (1918);  “Geological  Notes 
on  the  Pribilof  Islands,  Alaska,  with  an  Account  of  the  Fossil  Diatoms”  (1918);  “Random 
Notes  on  Alaska  Snow  Buntings”  (1923);  and  “Rare  mammals  of  the  Pribilof  Islands, 
Alaska”  (1923). 

In  1923,  Hanna  attempted  to  publish  a  manuscript  recounting  his  observations  and 
experiences  on  the  Seal  Islands  infused  with  historical  background  of  the  islands.  His 
draft  manuscript,  entitled  “The  Alaska  Fur-Seal  Islands”  was  found  among  files  at  NOAA’s 
National  Marine  Mammal  Faboratory  (NMMF)  Fibrary  in  Seattle,  Washington.  Hanna 
had  been  unsuccessful  in  his  attempts  to  publish  the  manuscript.  This  junior  author

edited  and  published  Hanna’s  eighty-five-year-old  manuscript  as  a  limited  edition  in  2008 
through  NOAA  and  the  Government  Printing  Office. 

Amazingly,  G  and  Elizabeth  also  taught  school  on  the  islands.  Also,  “For  a  period  of 
several  months,  beginning  in  October,  1913,  the  radio  station  on  St.  George  Island  was 
operated  by  Mr.  G.  Dallas  Hanna,  the  Bureau’s  schoolteacher  on  the  island.”28 

The  Pribilof  Islands  offered  many  avenues  for  Hanna  to  expand  his  natural  history 
research  and  studies,  and  in  June  of  1919,  he  received  a  PhD  from  George  Washington 
University.  His  thesis  concerned  the  natural  history  of  the  Pribilof  Islands.  While  Hanna 
subsequently  accepted  an  appointment  with  the  California  Academy  of  Sciences  in  1919, 
he  continued  to  work  on  the  Pribilofs  during  the  summers  of  1919  and  1920. 

In  1919  he  accepted  an  appointment  as  Curator  of  the  Department  of  Paleontology  [now 
Geology]  in  the  California  Academy  of  Sciences,  at  the  invitation  of  the  Academy’s  then 
director,  Barton  Warren  Evermann,  who — in  his  previous  capacity  as  chief  of  the  Alaska 
Division  of  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Fisheries — had  acquired  first-hand  knowledge  of  Dr.  Hanna’s 
brilliant  mind  and  versatile  abilities.29 

In  1960,  Hanna  revisited  St.  Paul  Island  for  one  week  in  the  company  of  his  second 
wife  Margaret  and  a  Mr.  I<.  I<.  Bechtel,  President  of  the  Belvedere  Scientific  Fund.  Hanna 
visited  with  Agent  Roy  Hurd  and  Program  Director  Howard  Baltzo,  among  others.  The 
group  asked  Hanna  numerous  questions  about  his  recollections  of  conditions  and  events 
on  the  island.  They  recorded  the  questions  and  answers  on  tape.  The  tape  was  later  tran¬ 
scribed  and  titled  “A  Comparison  of  Conditions  on  St.  Paul  Island  During  1913-1920 
with  the  Present.”  Hanna  also  prepared  a  “resume,”  as  he  termed  it,  in  a  very  limited  edi¬ 
tion  of  two  copies.  Copies  of  each  document  were  sent  to  Victor  B.  Scheffer  with  the  Fish 
and  Wildlife  Service  at  Sand  Point,  Seattle,  Washington.  Hanna  wrote  in  his  brief  cover 
letter  to  Scheffer: 

I  am  glad  to  be  able  to  send  you  a  copy  of  the  “Comments.”  It  is  a  very  disconnected  sort 
of  thing  and  tape  recording  was  new  to  me.  Except  for  Mr.  Bechtel’s  insistence  I  am  sure  it 
would  not  have  been  copies  [sic]. 

After  returning  from  St.  Paul,  I  wrote  out  a  resume  of  my  observations  in  what  seems  to 
me  to  be  in  better  form.  I  have  only  two  copies  of  this  but  have  enclosed  it  with  the  tape 
recording.  If  you  should  have  it  copied  by  any  chance,  you  might  send  it  back  to  me;  or  a 
substitute  copy  would  do. 

Scheffer  left  a  typed  copy  of  Hanna’s  August  5,  1960,  six-page,  plus  two  maps  and 
one  photograph,  “resume”  titled  “Random  Comparisons  of  St.  Paul  Island  as  Observed 
by  Dr.  G.  Dallas  Hanna  in  1960  After  an  Absence  of  40  Years”  in  the  files  at  the  NMMF 
Fibrary  in  Seattle.  Scheffer  presumably  returned  the  original  two  copies  back  to  Hanna, 
as  per  Scheffer’s  statement  in  a  letter  of  reply  dated  December  12,  1960,  which  is  also  in 
the  NMMF  Fibrary  files.

The  1894  U.S.  Census  of  St.  Paul  Island  listed 
Alexander  “Alex”  Hanson  as  a  thirty-six-year-old 
bachelor.  The  1895  census  recorded  his  marriage 
to  Lukina  (aka  Lukaria  and  Lukeria;  nickname

1,  1877.  Lukina  was  the  daughter  of  Aggie  and 
Mary  Kushin.  Lukina’s  two-year  old  son,  Nestor 
Kushin,  born  November  7,  1892,  on  St.  Paul 
Island,31  was  the  third  member  of  the  Alexander 
and  Lukina  Hanson  family.  Alex  Hanson  died  on 
Sunday,  May  17,  1896,  a  month  after  the  birth  of 
the  couple’s  son,  John  (April  9,  1896).  The  St.  Paul 
Agent’s  Log  noted: 

Native  fishing,  only  4  fish  caught.  Among  those 
fishing  was  Alex.  Hanson.  Upon  his  return  home 
he  dropped  dead  of  heart  failure.  Every  effort  was 
made  to  discern  signs  of  life  without  success.32 

In  1901  widow  Lukeria  (Kushin)  Hanson 
married  Alexander  Galaktionef  (born  at  Atka 
in  1872)  on  St.  Paul  Island.  The  St.  Paul  Island  Census  of  1910  showed  Alexander  and 
Lukeria  Galaktionef  had  the  following  four  children  from  their  marriage  and  two  from 
other  unions:  Mary,  born  May  29,  1902;  Matrona,  October  17,  1903;  Aggie,  November  3, 
1906;  Anna  Hanson,  stepdaughter,  born  August  14,  1900;33  John  Hanson,  born  1896  (left 
St.  Paul  Island  for  Salem  Indian  Training  School  in  Chemawa,  Oregon34  on  June  29, 1911); 
and  Nestor  Kushin,  stepson,  born  November  7,  1892. 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Alexander  Hanson35  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  April  30,  1892,  before 
Notary  Public  Clement  Bennett  at  San  Francisco,  California.  The  following  is  an  excerpt 
from  that  deposition. 

I  am  34  years  of  age,  a  native  of  Sitka,  Alaska,  and  was  educated  in  the  public  schools  of 
California,  and  afterwards  attended  school  six  years  in  Lovisa,  Finland,  returning  to  the 
United  States  in  1875,  when  18  years  old.  I  immediately  took  service  as  a  second  mate 
on  the  schooner  Matthew  Turner,  and  later  on  the  steamer  Dora,  vessels  of  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company  sailing  to  Alaska,  and  was  employed  a  great  part  of  the  time,  for  two 
years  and  a  half,  in  the  Unalaska  district.  In  1886, 1  went  to  St.  Paul  Island  of  the  Pribilof 
group,  and  have  since  remained  there  constantly  from  that  time  until  August,  1891. 1  was 
employed  there  in  various  occupations  in  connection  with  sealing,  but  chiefly  in  handling 
sealskins  and  as  one  of  the  killing  gang,  and  am  familiar  with  every  phase  of  the  business.36

Genealogy 

John  Hanson  was  born  April  9,  1896,  on  St.  Paul 
Island  to  Alexander  Hanson  and  Lukina  (Lukaria, 
Lukeria;  nickname  Lucy37)  Kushin  Hanson 
(see  Alexander  Hanson  biography).  John  mar¬ 
ried  Chionia  Stepetin  on  August  9,  1916,  on  St. 
Paul.  Chionia  was  born  December  16,  1895,  on 
the  island,  the  daughter  of  Dorofay  Stepetin. 
According  to  the  St.  Paul  Island  1930  Census, 
John  and  Chionia  had  three  children  born  on  St. 
Paul  Island:  Frances,  a  daughter,  born  December 
30,  1917;  Xenofont,  a  son,  born  February  9,  1919; 
and  John  Alexander  Jr.,  born  February  4,  1920. 
On  June  9,  1950,  John  Hanson  Sr.  was  buried  on 
St.  Paul  Island,  with  the  whole  village  joining  in  a 
procession  to  the  cemetery. 

Biographical  Sketch 

John  Hanson  left  St.  Paul  Island  for  Salem  Indian 
Training  School  in  Chemawa,  Oregon,  on  June 
29,  1911.  According  to  the  island’s  1920  census, 
he  had  returned  to  St.  Paul  Island  from  Oregon 
and  was  working  as  a  sealer.  He  became  the  is¬ 
land’s  reindeer  herdsman  and,  later,  the  sealing 
crew  foreman  on  St.  Paul.

Soon  after  John  Hanson’s  passing,  his  son  Xenofont  found  a  fossilized  mammoth 
tooth  on  the  beach  in  the  wake  of  a  storm  at  Northeast  Point,  while  beachcombing  with 
zoologist  Victor  B.  Scheffer.  Scheffer  wrote: 

My  companion  was  Xenophon  [sic]  Hanson,  a  native  of  St.  Paul  who  speaks  the  Aleut 
tongue  as  well  as  English.  He  was  born  on  the  island  and  now  works  for  the  Government 
as  an  electrician.  He  suddenly  stooped  and  picked  up  a  strange  object,  which  he  is  shown 
holding  in  the  accompanying  illustration  [next  page]. 

Brushing  off  the  sand  he  brought  it  to  me,  turning  it  over  curiously  in  his  hands.  One 
glance  revealed  that  it  was  a  cheek  tooth  of  the  mammoth,  a  relative  of  the  elephant,  gone 
from  the  face  of  the  earth  for  10,000  years.  Not  since  the  1890’s  had  mammoth  remains 
been  found  on  St.  Paul  Island.  We  took  the  tooth  to  the  village  and  found  that  it  measured 
nine  and  one-quarter  inches  in  length  and  weighed  three  pounds,  eleven  ounces.  It  seemed 
to  be  partially  fossilized,  although  it  was  not  embedded  in  a  stony  matrix. . . .  Since  1836, 
discoveries  of  mammoth  remains  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  have  been  reported  five  times.  The 
most  recent  find  before  Hanson’s  was  one  made  by  Dr.  Robert  Evans  Snodgrass  in  1897,  in 
a  volcanic  cave  on  St.  Paul.38

Genealogy 

John  Peabody  Harrington  was  born  in  Waltham,  Massachusetts,  on  April  29, 1883,  to  Elliott 
Harrington,  a  prominent  lawyer,  and  Mary  L.  (Peabody)  Harrington.  John  Harrington  was 
married  briefly  to  Carabeth  Tucker,  with  whom  he  had  a  daughter,  Awona.39 

Biographical  Sketch 

John  Harrington  and  family  moved  to  Santa  Barbara,  California,  in  1886.  At  Santa 
Barbara,  Harrington’s  interest  in  Native  languages  began  while  listening  to  the  Indians 
speak  at  the  local  mission.  After  his  graduation  from  Stanford  University  in  1905,  he 
began  his  life’s  work,  “to  collect  extensive  and  accurate  linguistic  data  from  the  nearly 
extinct  languages  of  Southern  California.”40  However,  he  would  end  up  expanding  that 
goal.  In  1915  he  joined  the  Bureau  of  American  Ethnology,  where  he  concentrated  his 
research  on  ethnologic  and  linguistic  studies.41  “From  then  until  his  retirement,  nearly 
forty  years  later,  Harrington  had  .  .  .  virtually  unbounded  freedom  to  wander  the  North 
American  continent  carrying  out  his  mission  of  linguistic  and  cultural  documentation.”42 
Now  housed  at  the  Smithsonian  Institution,  his  collection  contains  data  for  125  languag¬ 
es  gathered  from  California  and  the  Far  West. 

Carabeth  Tucker  and  John  Harrington  were  research  colleagues.  In  1975,  at  nearly 
80,  Carabeth  Laird  published  a  biographical  portrait  of  her  former  husband  under  the 
title  Encounter  with  an  Angry  God.

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

John  Peabody  Harrington  worked  at  St.  Paul 
Island  from  October  to  mid-December  1941, 
studying  Aleut  customs,  taking  photographs,  and 
collecting  linguistic  sounds  in  the  form  of  descrip¬ 
tive  stories.  He  acquired  “an  extensive  [Aleut] 
vocabulary  and  a  number  of  written  texts”  with 
the  assistance  of  scribe  John  (Ivan)  Yatchmeneff, 
who  was  the  son  of  ethnographer  Waldemar 
Jochelson’s  assistant  Aleksey  M.  Yachmenev43 
(see  Jochelson’s  biography).  In  December  1941, 
Harrington  made  a  series  of  sound  recordings 
on  eighteen-inch  aluminum  discs,  capturing  the 
Aleut  language  in  both  word  and  song.  According 
to  James  R.  Glenn  in  1991,  fifteen  discs  were  ar¬ 
chived  at  the  Smithsonian  Institution  National 
Anthropological  Archives  (NAA),  and  thirteen 
others  at  the  National  Archives  and  Records

before  Notary  Public  Clement  Bennett  at  San  Francisco,  California.  The  following  is  an 
excerpt: 

I  reside  in  San  Francisco,  and  am  by  occupation  master  of  a  vessel.  Have  been  in  the 
employ  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  since  1881,  and  in  the  discharge  of  my  duties 
have  visited  annually,  with  one  exception,  the  different  trading  posts  on  the  islands  of 
the  Aleutian  Archipelago,  and  on  the  Alaskan  coast  in  the  Bering  Sea  as  far  north  as  St. 

Michaels,  and  prior  to  1890  I  went  annually  to  the  seal  islands  in  the  Bering  Sea.46 


Healy,  Captain  Michael  Augustine  (1839-1904) 

U.S.  Revenue  Marine  Service,  1865-1903 
Genealogy 

Michael  Augustine  Healy  was  born  on  September 
22,  1839, 4  on  a  1,600-acre  plantation48  near 
Macon,  Georgia.  Michael  was  the  youngest  son 
of  Irish  immigrant  plantation  owner  Michael 
Morris  Healy  (b.  ca.  1785-d.  1850),  and  Mary 
(aka  Maria)  Eliza  Clark  Smith  (1802-1850),  a 
mulatto  slave  purchased  by  the  senior  Michael 
Healy  from  Sam  Griswold,  a  gun  manufacturer 
of  Clinton,  Georgia.  Mary  Smith  was  the  slave 
daughter  of  Major  James  Smith  and  his  slave, 
also  named  Maria  and  also  of  Clinton,  Georgia.49 

Under  Georgia  law,  the  senior  Healy  could  not  marry  a  slave;  the  two  entered  into  a 
common-law  relationship.  Georgia  law  at  the  time  also  prevented  slave  owners  from  free¬ 
ing  their  slaves  except  by  a  special  act  of  the  state  legislature.50  Because  Mary  was  techni¬ 
cally  a  slave,  so  were  their  ten  children,  including  Michael  Augustine  Healy. 

Michael  A.  Healy  married  Mary  Jane  Roach  (1835-1907),  daughter  of  John  and 
Margaret  Roach,  in  Boston,  Massachusetts,  on  31  January  1865.  Margaret  Healy  accom¬ 
panied  Michael  on  many  voyages  to  the  Bering  Sea  and  bore  him  one  son,  Frederick  A. 
Healy  (1870-1912).51 

Michael  Augustine  Healy  died  of  a  heart  attack  one  year  after  retirement  on  August 
30,  1904,  at  San  Francisco,  California.52

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Biographical  Sketch 

The  local  Georgia  schools  closed  their  doors  to  the  Healy  “slave”  children.  In  1837,  Michael 
Morris  Healy  defiantly  determined  that  his  children  would  not  be  deprived  of  an  educa¬ 
tion.  He  sought  opportunity  for  his  children  in  the  North.  Several  of  the  Healy  brothers 
enrolled  at  Holy  Cross  College,  and  in  1849,  the  young  Michael  A.  Healy  enrolled  at  Holy 
Cross  grammar  school  in  Worcester,  Massachusetts.53  William  Lucey’s  book  Vie  Catholic 
Church  In  Maine  examined  the  Healy  story  and  offered  some  background  as  to  how  the 
Healy  children  ended  up  at  Holy  Cross  College: 

A  providential  meeting  between  Michael  Healy,  the  father,  and  Bishop  Fitzpatrick  of 
Boston,  changed  the  lives  of  the  Healy  children.  The  bishop  told  him  to  send  his  sons  to 
Holy  Cross  College  in  Worcester,  only  one  year  in  operation,  and  his  daughters  to  Boston 
where  his  own  sister  would  look  out  for  them.  In  the  fall  of  1844,  the  four  Healys  enrolled 
at  the  college,  Sherwood  coming  from  the  plantation  to  join  James,  Hugh  and  Patrick  who 
were  in  New  Jersey.54 

The  younger  Michael  Healy  ran  away  from  school  several  times,  twice  from  Holy 
Cross  and  once  from  a  Catholic  school  in  Quebec.  Eventually  the  call  of  the  sea  won  out 
over  education  in  his  mind.55 

In  1855,  not  quite  sixteen  years  of  age  and  thanks  to  his  influential  brother  James, 
Michael  Healy  embarked  on  a  life  at  sea  as  mate  aboard  the  clipper  ship  Jumna  out  of 
the  port  of  Boston.  After  ten  years  on  merchant  ships  where  his  career  fared  poorly, 
Michael  received  an  appointment  from  Abraham  Lincoln  to  the  Revenue  Marine  Service. 
At  that  time  an  appointment  to  a  respectable  government  position  required  “the  support 
of  influential  benefactors.”  Purportedly,  his  brother  James,  now  personal  secretary  to  the 
Catholic  Bishop  of  Boston,  had  attained  sufficient  political  status  to  arrange  for  the  ap¬ 
pointment.  Michael  had  matured  and  had  been  passing  for  white;  otherwise  he  probably 
would  not  have  made  it  into  the  ranks  of  either  the  Navy  or  Revenue  Marine.  He  now 
dedicated  his  life  to  the  Service  and  rose  in  rank  from  third  lieutenant  on  March  4,  1865, 
to  captain  on  March  3,  1883.56 

Michael  Healy  became  known  as  “Hell  Roaring  Mike”  by  the  men  who  served  with 
him.  He  never  lost  a  ship  under  his  command,  but  he  did  lose  the  respect  of  his  crew 
when,  in  the  last  six  years  of  his  service,  he  began  to  show  signs  of  drinking  to  excess. 
Charges  were  brought  against  him  twice.  On  the  second  occasion  he  was  demoted,  but 
he  was  restored  to  the  rank  of  captain  a  year  before  his  retirement  in  September  1903. 
Through  it  all,  his  wife  Mary  Jane  remained  loyal.57 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Captain  Michael  A.  Healy  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  April  7, 1892,  before 
Notary  Public  Clement  Bennett  at  San  Francisco,  California.  The  following  is  from  his  de¬

been  in  command  of  the  United  States  revenue  steamer  Bear,  prior  to  which  time  I  had

were  employed  almost  exclusively  in  navigating  the  waters  of  Bering  Sea,  guarding  the 
seal  islands,  and  protecting  the  seals  found  in  those  waters  from  destruction  by  poaching 
vessels  engaged  in  what  is  known  as  pelagic  sealing.  My  first  voyage  was  made  to  the  seal 
islands  in  1869,  and  I  have  cruised  annually  for  the  last  twelve  years  in  the  Alaskan  waters 
about  the  Pribilof  Islands  up  to  the  present  time.58 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Captain  Michael  Healy  commanded  a  succession  of  cutters:  Chandler  (1877),  Thomas 
Corwin  (1880-86),  Bear  (1886-95),  McCulloch  (circa  1900),  Golden  Gate  and  Hartley 
(circa  1901-02)  and  Thetis  (1902-03). 59  During  his  years  of  service  in  the  Bering  Sea, 
Healy  was  not  only  captain  of  his  ship,  but  he  also  served  the  people  of  the  Pribilof  Islands 
and  Alaska  as  a  census-taker,  judge,  mail  carrier,  and  food  and  materials  supplier.  The 
uncontrolled  exuberance  of  those  Americans  who  went  unleashed  to  feast  upon  Alaska’s 
biological  bounty  brought  famine  and  insult  to  Native  societies  by  their  introduction  of 
alcohol,  disease,  firearms,  and  western  culture.  In  an  attempt  to  compensate  for  the  re¬ 
duction  in  subsistence  resources,  especially  seals,  whales  and  walrus,  Captain  Healy  on 
the  Bear  cooperated  with  the  Reverend  Sheldon  Jackson  to  arrange  the  delivery  of  the  first

Henriques,  Captain  John  A.  (1826-1906) 

U.S.  Revenue  Marine  Service,  1854-1906  (Captain  1866-1906) 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Captain  John  A.  Henriques  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  April  7,  1892, 
before  Notary  Public  George  Y.  Coffin  at  Washington,  D.C.  An  excerpt  follows. 

of  New  London,  Conn.,  being  duly  sworn,  deposes  and  says:  I  am  65  years  of  age,  and  a 
captain  in  the  U.S.  Revenue  Marine,  and  have  been  in  the  service  for  twenty-nine  years. 

In  the  fall  of  1868  I  was  ordered  to  Sitka  and  in  the  spring  of  1869  received  instructions  to 
proceed  at  once  with  the  revenue  steamer  Lincoln  to  Bering  Sea  in  order  to  protect  the  seal 
life  from  depredations,  information  having  been  received  that  seal-skins  had  been  taken 
from  the  Pribilof  Islands  by  unauthorized  persons  during  the  previous  season. . . .  On  the 
13th  of  May  I  left  Kodiak  pursuant  to  orders,  with  14  men  of  the  Second  Artillery  and  the 
commissioned  officer,  Lieutenant  Mast. . . .  On  May  22nd,  I  landed  a  portion  of  the  troops 
and  Lieutenant  Barnes,  of  the  revenue  service,  with  rations  and  stores,  on  St.  Paul  Island, 
one  of  the  Pribilof  group.  The  troops  were  here  landed  for  the  purpose  of  enforcing  the 
United  States  Statute  providing  for  the  protection  of  seal  life. 

After  landing  I  called  all  the  natives  together,  and  through  an  interpreter  informed  them  of 
the  purport  of  the  orders  and  directions  of  the  Treasury  Department. ...  I  had  heard  from 
the  natives  that  seals  were  very  timid,  and  thereupon  ordered  all  the  dogs  on  the  island  to 
be  killed,  which  order  was  executed  within  ten  minutes  after  it  was  given.  I  further  asked 
the  natives  to  surrender  all  firearms  in  their  possession  until  the  close  of  the  sealing  season. 

. . .  this  also  they  immediately  did.  During  the  time  I  was  on  the  island  I  particularly  noticed 
the  care  that  the  natives  took  not  to  disturb  the  seal  rookeries,  even  warning  some  of  our 
party  from  the  use  of  tobacco  in  any  form  in  the  neighborhood  of  such  rookeries. . . .  On 
May  24th  I  landed  Lieutenant  Henderson,  of  the  Revenue  Marine,  on  St.  George  Island 
with  the  remainder  of  the  troops. . . .  Lieutenant  Henderson  was  vested  with  the  same 
authority  on  St.  George  Island  that  Lieutenant  Barnes  had  on  St.  Paul  Island.  [The  natives] 
readily  complied  with  the  orders  in  relation  to  dogs  and  the  use  of  firearms.62

Biography 

W  illiam  Hereford  received  his  BS  from  Santa  Clara  College  at  San  Jose,  California,  in 
1874.  He  graduated  with  a  MD  degree  from  the  University  of  Pennsylvania  in  1877.  He 
was  a  qualified  surgeon.64 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Dr.  William  Hereford  began  his  medical  career 
in  Alaska  with  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company 
in  1880.  He  took  a  position  with  the  North 
American  Commercial  Company  when  the  ACC 
lost  its  bid  to  renew  the  Seal  Islands  lease  with 
the  government. 

Dr.  Hereford  was  an  avid  photographer; 
he  joined  forces  with  Pribilof  Islands  teacher 
Nicolas  Gray  to  provide  future  historians  with 
interesting  images  of  human  life  on  the  Seal 
Islands.  Some  of  Dr.  Hereford’s  photographs  are 
conserved  in  the  Alaska  State  Library  at  Juneau. 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Dr.  Hereford  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  April  12,  1892,  before  Notary 
Public  Clement  Bennett  at  San  Francisco,  California.  The  following  is  an  excerpt. 

I  am  39  years  of  age,  and  am  a  physician.  I  hold  the  degree  of  B.S.,  Santa  Clara  College, 

S.J.,  year  1874,  also  a  regular  graduate  of  the  medical  department  of  the  University  of 
Pennsylvania,  year  1877;  am  a  regular  practitioner  of  medicine  and  surgery.”65 

I  entered  the  service  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  August,  1880,  for  the  purpose  of 
being  one  of  the  resident  physicians  on  the  seal  islands  [sic  passim],  and  was  continuously 
in  their  employ  until  May,  1890,  at  which  time  I  went  into  the  employ  of  the  North 
American  Commercial  Company  in  the  same  capacity  until  the  latter  part  of  August,  1891, 
having  left  by  resignation.  I  was  in  the  service  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  almost 
ten  years  and  with  the  North  American  Commercial  Company  about  fifteen  months,  and 
had  a  total  connection  with  the  seal  islands  a  little  over  ten  years.  Seal  and  seal  life  being 
the  only  and  all  absorbing  topic  of  conversation,  business,  food,  etc.,  equally  with  the 
natives  as  ourselves,  one  naturally  becomes  almost  as  familiar  with  the  fur-seals  and  their 
habits,  as  a  farmer  would  with  those  of  the  cattle  and  horses  on  his  farm. 

In  my  capacity  of  physician  and  surgeon  to  the  sealing  companies  ...  I  was  stationed  the 
first  year,  i.e.  1880  and  1881,  at  St.  George  Island,  and  in  1881  and  1882  at  Unalaska,  at 
which  time  my  duties  required  me  to  sail  from  Unalaska  to  Attu,  Belkofskie,  Atka,  Unga, 
etc.  I  have  been  from  Kodiak  to  Attu  and  have  visited  the  way  places  between  those 
points. . . .  After  1882  I  was  at  St.  Paul  Island,  with  the  exception  of  my  vacations  in  San 
Francisco,  Cal.,  until  1890  and  1891,  when  I  was  again  placed  on  St.  George  Island.66 

Dr.  Hereford  talked  about  the  edible  portions  of  the  fur  seal: 

The  brain,  heart,  liver,  and  kidneys  make  very  good  eating,  and  taste  about  the  same 
as  those  of  other  animals.  The  meat,  however,  which  must  be  entirely  freed  from  all  its 
blubber  or  fat,  though  quite  nutritious  and  palatable,  is  somewhat  soft,  of  a  dark  color,  and

1860  and  imprisoned  at  Constantinople.  After  his 
release,  he  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  1865, 
near  the  end  of  the  Civil  War.70  “He  was  active  in

Dr.  Hopkins’  obituary  summarized  his  life  as  a  scientist: 

When  Hopkins  died,  on  November  2,  2001,  he  was  remembered  as  “the  Arctic  scientist 
who  promoted  the  theory  that  a  now-submerged  land  link  between  Siberia  and  Alaska

Seward  Peninsula  in  the  early  1940’s  as  a  research  scientist  with  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey. 
Working  with  botanists,  archeologists  and  other  scientific  specialists  in  the  1950s  and 
’60s,  Hopkins  promoted  the  theory  that  the  land  bridge  linked  Asia  and  North  America 
and  allowed  humans,  animals  and  plant  communities  to  migrate  some  12,000  years  ago. 
Hopkins  worked  as  a  research  scientist  for  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  from  1942  until

He  taught,  conducted  research,  and  directed  the  Alaska  Quaternary  Center  until  his 
retirement  in  1994.78 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Dr.  David  Hopkins  led  geologic  studies  of  the  Pribilof  Islands.  During  the  summers  of 
1962  and  1965,  his  field  work  included  studying  the  evidence  for  the  age  of  St.  George 
and  St.  Paul  islands.  An  in-depth  study  of  fossil  evidence,  volcanic  activity,  and  geologic 
profiles  indicated  that  St.  George  Island  was  older  than  St.  Paul  Island  by  nearly  two  mil¬ 
lion  years.79 

A  small  ice  cap  . . .  and  at  least  two,  probably  four,  cirque  glaciers  occurred  on  St.  George 
Island,  Pribilof  Islands,  probably  during  the  Illinoian  Glaciation.  Snowbanks  persisted 
during  a  later  cold  cycle,  probably  during  the  Wisconsin  Glaciation,  with  no  glaciers 
existing.  We  found  no  evidence  of  glaciation  on  other  Pribilof  Islands. 

The  Pleistocene  history  of  the  Pribilof  Islands  interests  geologists,  anthropologists,  and 
biogeographers  because  the  islands  lie  near  the  southwestern  edge  of  the  continental  shelf 
that  extends  between  Alaska  and  Siberia,  beneath  the  Bering  and  Chukchi  Seas.  The  islands 
are  thus  favorably  situated  to  provide  a  record,  as  to  time  and  environment,  of  former  land 
connections  between  Asia  and  America.80

species.  He  is  credited  with  saving  the  American  bison  from  extinction.  His  book  Thirty 
Years  War  for  Wildlife:  Gains  and  Losses  in  the  Thankless  Task  is  his  own  testament  to  his 
passion.85 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Henry  Wood  Elliott  (see  Elliott’s  biography)  had  worked  feverishly  to  convince  the  United 
States  government  to  enter  into  a  treaty  to  save  the  northern  fur  seal  from  extinction.  The 
Hay-Durand  Agreement  for  a  Fur-Seal  Treaty  of  1905  grew  from  collaboration  among 
Secretary  ol  State  John  Hay,  Henry  W.  Elliott,  and  U.S.  Senators  Dillingham,  Pratt,  and 
Foraker.  These  men  had  crafted  a  fur-seal  treaty  between  the  United  States  and  Great 
Britain  that  called  for  an  end  to  pelagic  sealing,  joint  control  over  the  fur-seal  harvests, 
and  a  fair  division  of  profits.  Secretary  Hay  approved  the  draft  on  March  7,  1905.  British 
Ambassador  to  the  United  States  Sir  Mortimer  Durand  approved  the  draft  three  weeks 
later  on  March  27. 

Secretary  Hay  died  on  July  1,  1905,  during  a  sea  voyage  taken  for  health  reasons.  He 
had  instructed  Henry  Elliott  to  finalize  the  document,  and  Elliott  and  Second  Assistant 
Secretary  of  State  Alvey  Adee  met  with  Hay’s  replacement,  Secretary  Elihu  Root  on  that 
account.  Secretary  Root  scrapped  the  treaty  for  undisclosed  reasons.86 

In  1906,  the  fur  seal’s  strongest  protagonist,  Henry  Elliott  “reached  a  point  where 
hope  died;  he  saw  that  he  could  go  no  further.  At  last  he  became  so  ill  with  anxiety  to  save 
his  beloved  seals  from  extinction  that  his  insistence  turned  savage,  and  his  relations  with 
certain  scientists  and  bureau  officers  of  Washington  became  a  complete  wreck.”87  Early  in 
1907,  Elliott  prevailed  upon  Hornaday  to  “do  something  to  save  those  fur  seals.”88 

In  the  spring  of  1909,  Hornaday  suddenly  realized  a  sense  of  duty  and  boldly  ac¬ 
cepted  Elliot’s  request  for  help  to  save  the  fur  seal.  However,  Hornaday  “brutally  pro¬ 
posed  to  Elliot”  that  he  refrain  from  all  contact  with  government  officials.  Elliot  accepted 
Hornaday ’s  proposal.89 

Hornaday  accepted  Elliott’s  challenge  with  the  zeal  he  gave  to  other  wildlife  conser¬ 
vation  causes.  He  began  by  proposing  a  resolution  before  a  meeting  of  the  Committee 
on  Resolutions  at  the  Seventh  International  Zoological  Congress  in  Boston  in  1907.  The 
committee  president  was  the  renowned  zoologist  Alexander  Agassiz,  son  of  the  late 
Louis  Agassiz.  Hornaday ’s  resolution  failed  to  pass  due  to  the  protest  of  an  aged  Russian 
delegate  “on  the  ground  that  it  touched  ‘the  realm  of  foreign  diplomacy’,  and  therefore  lay 
beyond  the  terms  of  his  authority  to  act.”90 

By  January  1909,  estimates  of  the  Pribilof  Islands’  fur-seal  population  ranged  from 
30,000  to  130, 000.91  The  Toronto  Globe  printed  an  editorial  on  the  subject  of  opposing 
a  treaty  that  closed  with:  “If  this  fur-seal  business  has  ever  been  equaled  for  organized 
deception  and  hidden  political  influence  the  world  has  never  been  enlightened  by  the 
disclosure.”92 


311 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Hornaday  then  made  a  bold  political  move.  He  had  recently  become  chairman  of  the 
newly  formed  Committee  on  Wild  Life  Protection  of  the  Camp-Fire  Club  of  America;  he 
also  served  on  the  club’s  board  of  governors.93 

Brandishing  facts  and  figures,  Hornaday  won  the  board’s  unanimous  approval  and 
convinced  the  committee  of  “the  need  for  strong  action,  and  the  necessity  for  interference 
in  the  fur-seal  situation  by  independent  private  citizens.”  Hornaday  wrote,  “for  better 
or  worse  .  .  .  the  Club  made  good  throughout  the  stormy  two  years’  campaign  that  fol¬ 
lowed.”94  Commitment  in  hand,  Hornaday  traveled  to  Washington  to  meet  with  the  chair¬ 
man  of  the  new  Senate  Committee  on  the  Conservation  of  National  Resources,  Senator 
Joseph  M.  Dixon  of  Montana.  Hornaday  handed  Dixon  a  resolution  prepared  by  Elliott 
that  echoed  the  failed  Hay-Durand  Treaty  effort  of  1905-06: 

(1)  The  immediate  stoppage  of  the  leasing  system. 

(2)  The  making  of  a  treaty  with  England,  Japan,  and  Russia  to  stop  the  killing  of  seals  at  sea, 
on  a  percentage  compensation  basis,  and 

(3)  A  5-  or  10-year  close  season  for  the  recuperation  of  the  herds.95 

Dixon  declared  he  would  “spare  no  effort  in  trying  to  secure  the  passage  of  a  satis¬ 
factory  bill,”  but  he  failed  to  make  progress.96  Hornaday  then  sent  a  letter  appealing  to 
Secretary  of  State  Philander  C.  Knox  to  back  the  treaty  that  was  being  touted  on  the  one 
hand  as  “in  negotiations,”  while  on  the  other  hand  “no  steps  have  been  taken.” 

After  all  these  years  of  failures  in  attempts  to  improve  the  condition  of  the  unfortunate  and 
persecuted  fur  seals  by  treaty  measures,  it  is  now  high  time  for  you  and  your  Department 
to  take  hold  of  this  matter,  and  achieve  one  diplomatic  triumph!97 

According  to  Hornaday  his  letter  to  Secretary  Knox  was  never  answered— “but, 
believe  me  or  not,  within  ten  days  from  its  posting  [the  letter]  the  wheels  of  the  State 
Department  were  in  motion,  and  they  never  stopped  moving  until  Secretary  Knox  DID 
‘achieve  one  diplomatic  triumph!’  ”98 

On  December  10,  1909,  the  Camp-Fire  Club  released  a  nearly  2,000-word  article, 
“The  Loss  of  the  Fur  Seal  Industry.”  According  to  Hornaday  it  was  printed  in  full  by  about 
twenty-five  newspapers.99  Taking  a  pacific  stance,  the  Camp-Fire  Club  declared  that 
“there  would  be  no  exhibitions  of  bad  blood,  no  quarreling,  and  no  fighting!  On  the  con¬ 
trary,  it  will  be  a  love-feast.”100 

However,  a  contrary  scenario  played  out.  In  Hornaday ’s  words: 

And  then — ye  gods  and  little  fishes!  At  the  beginning  of  the  third  act  of  the  play,  there 
started,  and  continued  right  down  to  the  end,  the  bitterest  and  most  brutal  fight  ever 
waged  around  the  fur  seal.101  When  I  first  entered  the  United  States  Capitol  filled  with 
a  desire  to  play  a  part  in  the  salvage  of  the  fur  seal  and  its  “industry”,  I  little  dreamed 
that  I  was  breaking  into  a  hornet’s  nest  of  the  first  magnitude.  It  was  reeking  with  selfish 
interests,  cross  purposes,  intrigue,  and  chicanery.  In  my  crass  innocence,  I  assumed  that 
the  case  had  become  so  bad  and  so  desperate  that  everyone  would  welcome  every  sane  and 
logical  remedial  effort,  and  play  fair!102 

Within  three  months  of  the  article  in  the  press,  the  Senate  Committee  on  the 
Conservation  of  National  Resources,  chaired  by  Senator  Dixon,  convened  a  hearing 
on  “A  Bill  to  protect  the  fur-seal  fisheries  of  Alaska,  and  of  other  purposes.”  Outside  of 


312 


Biographies  H  ♦  Hornaday 


Congress,  only  Hornaday  was  invited  or  even  notified  of  the  hearing.  Hornaday  quips 
as  to  the  possible  reason:  “Save  Mr.  Elliott,  no  one  outside  of  Congress  manifested  the 
slightest  interest  in  the  fate  of  the  unhappy  fur  seals.”103  Hornaday  presented  himself  and 
the  cause  magnificently.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  testimony,  the  eleven-member  com¬ 
mittee  moved  and  unanimously  passed  a  resolution  “that  the  Chairman  be  instructed  to 
communicate  to  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  and  Labor  the  view  of  the  Committee  that  a 
new  lease  for  the  killing  of  fur  seals  should  not  be  made,  and  that  steps  should  be  taken  to 
secure  treaties  with  foreign  governments  for  the  prevention  of  pelagic  sealing.”104 

After  nearly  forty  years,  the  committee’s  message  put  an  end  to  the  fur-seal  fisheries 
leasing  system.  The  North  American  Commercial  Company’s  lease  expired  at  the  end  of 
April  1910.  Heretofore,  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  and  Labor  had  been  intent  on  making 
a  new  lease.  Hornaday  wrote,  “The  Bureau  of  Lisheries  held  that  the  making  of  a  new  lease 
was  mandatory;  and  up  to  the  starting  of  our  campaign  not  a  soul  in  the  Advisory  Board 
of  the  Lur  Seal  Service,  nor  in  the  Department  of  Commerce  and  Labor  had  said  anything 
whatever  against  the  making  of  a  new  lease,  nor  in  proposal  of  any  new  measures  for  the 
saving  of  the  seal  herds.”105 

Department  of  Commerce  and  Labor  Secretary  Charles  Nagel  had  convinced  the 
President  to  allow  his  agency  to  redraft  the  bill  by  successfully  arguing  that  the  Dixon 
Resolution  was  “inadequate.”106  Nagel’s  version  allowed  the  killing  of  2,500  seals  per  year 
over  the  proposed  five-year  moratorium  for  subsistence  of  Pribilof  Natives,  and  $50,000 
per  year  for  the  “care  of  the  idle  seal-killers  and  their  families.”107  But  more  significantly, 
the  legislation  contained  language,  inserted  by  Secretary  Nagel,  authorizing  the  Secretary 
“all  power  over  the  seals,  to  kill  or  not  to  kill,  as  he  might  choose.”108  This  statement  prob¬ 
ably  reflected  the  mindset  of  the  Bureau  of  Lisheries  agents  displayed  by  Agent  Walter 
Lembkey  back  in  1906: 

Unless  this  settlement  [of  the  pelagic  sealing  question]  on  a  satisfactory  basis  appears 
imminent,  I  would  recommend  the  killing  on  land  of  every  seal  that  can  be  killed  under 
existing  law.109 

Hornaday,  representing  the  Camp-Lire  Club,  boldly  approached  President  William 
Howard  Taft  upon  learning  of  Secretary  Nagel’s  intent  to  leave  “future  killings  of  fur  seals 
in  his  [the  Secretary’s]  sole  control.”  Hornaday  asked  the  President  to  send  a  message  to 
Congress  requesting  that  it  pass  the  bill,  but  with  a  proviso  negating  Nagel’s  attempt  to 
nullify  the  bill’s  goal  of  protecting  the  seal  herd  from  further  slaughter  until  it  recovered 
to  sustainable  numbers.110 

On  March  15,  1910,  President  Taft  sent  the  following  message  to  Congress: 

It  appears  that  the  seal  herds  on  the  islands  named  have  been  reduced  to  such  an  extent 
that  their  early  extinction  must  be  looked  for,  unless  measures  for  their  preservation  be 
adopted. . . .  TLe  herds  have  been  reduced  to  such  an  extent  that  the  question  of  profit  has 
become  a  mere  incident,  and  the  controlling  question  has  become  one  of  conservation. . . . 

The  discontinuance  of  this  policy  [of  killing]  is  recommended  in  order  that  the  United 
States  may  be  free  to  deal  with  the  general  question  in  its  negotiations  with  foreign 
countries.111

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


On  April  21,  1910,  Congress  passed  An  Act  to  protect  the  seal  fisheries  of  Alaska,  and 
for  other  purposes  (S.7942;  Public  Act  no.  146).  The  effective  date  of  May  1,  1910,n~  was 
commensurate  with  the  expiration  of  the  North  American  Commercial  Company  lease. 
Some  significant  mandates  in  the  legislation  included: 

A  continued  ban  on  pelagic  sealing  by  U.S.  nationals 
A  ban  on  killing  females  and  pups  on  land 
Termination  of  the  leasing  system 

However,  the  bill  did  not  offer  the  total  ban  on  killing  sought  by  Hornaday.  He  stressed 
to  Senator  Dixon  that  Secretary  Nagel  “should  give  some  definite  assurance  that  except 
for  food  no  seals  would  be  killed  on  the  Seal  Islands  for  the  next  five  years.”115  Senator 
Dixon  replied,  “As  I  understand  it,  the  policy  of  the  administration  is  to  enforce  a  closed 
season.  That  is  the  desired  policy.”114  Dixon’s  reply  was  again  politically  expedient.  On 
May  1,  1910,  within  two  weeks  after  the  bill  was  signed,  news  was  published  in  Seattle 
“that  Fish  Commissioner  [Ward  T.]  Bowers  intended  to  kill  an  unstated  number  of  fur 
seals  for  commercial  purposes,  because  ‘they  ought  to  be  killed.’  ”115  As  Hornaday  put  it, 
“the  gentlemen’s  agreement  with  a  Committee  of  the  Senate  was  completely  ignored.”116 

On  May  10,  1910,  Dr.  Hornaday  and  the  Camp-Fire  Club  sent  a  strong  letter  of  pro¬ 
test  to  Secretary  Nagel.  Hornaday  later  wrote  that  Nagel’s  reply  “was  defiant,  and  wholly 
unsatisfactory.  A  stronger  protest  followed  the  first  one,  and  the  correspondence  became 
savage.”117  The  final  straw  came  on  August  1,  1910,  when  it  was  learned  that  12,920  fur 
seals,  including  7,733  pups,  females,  and  yearlings,  had  been  killed  for  their  pelts  on  the 
Pribilofs.118 

Around  this  time,  Secretary  Nagel  apparently  sought  relief  from  Hornaday ’s  constant 
assault.  Presumably  Nagel  wrote  to  the  president  of  the  New  York  Zoological  Society. 
Nagel  asked  if  Hornaday  spoke  for  the  Society  or  the  Bronx  Zoo.  The  society’s  president 
responded  that  Charles  S.  Townsend,  Director  of  the  New  York  Aquarium,  also  reign¬ 
ing  under  the  auspices  of  the  Zoological  Society,  was  himself  a  defender  of  the  seals. 
However,  neither  represented  the  Society  on  the  issue  over  the  fur  seals.119  Regardless, 
Hornaday ’s  own  acclaim  and  his  role  in  the  Camp-Fire  Club  of  America  gave  him  all  the 
standing  necessary  for  this  fight.  Hornaday  continued  his  assault. 

Hornaday  wrote  to  Henry  Elliott,  “One  of  my  answers  to  the  seal  killers  was — Henry 
W.  Elliott!”  Recall  that  back  in  1909,  Hornaday  “brutally”  requested  Elliott  to  stay  quietly 
in  the  background  feeding  technical  expertise  and  advice  to  his  fellow  fur-seal  advocates. 
Hornaday  wrote  on: 

This  action  is  an  act  of  war.  The  lid  is  now  off.  So  far  as  I  am  concerned  you  are  henceforth 
entirely  at  liberty  to  fight  the  common  enemy  just  as  you  see  fit;  for  it  must  now  be  a  fight 
to  the  absolute  defeat  of  one  side  or  the  other.120 

Elliott  wholeheartedly  entered  the  fray  “inspired  by  memories  of  former  battles  when 
he  fought  alone;  by  the  memories  of  years  of  official  blundering,  failures,  and  maltreat¬ 
ment  of  the  seals,  and  of  indignities  that  had  been  heaped  upon  him  when  overwhelmed 
by  enemies.  Mr.  Elliott  had  the  situation  so  thoroughly  in  hand,  and  he  so  well  main¬ 
tained  the  advantage  of  being  absolutely  right,  that  very  little  further  effort  by  us  was

The  Camp  Fire  Club  of  America  has  appointed  a  Committee  on  Pro¬ 
tective  Legislation  and  Game  Preserves,  consisting  of  fifteen  scientists  and 
lawyers,  with  Dr.  William  T.  Hornaday,  Director  of  the  New  York  Zoo¬ 
logical  Park,  as  Chairman.  This  Committee  recentlv  met  for  organiza¬ 
tion  and  every  member  pledged  his  active  support  to  the  two  measures 
which  will  be  undertaken  at  this  time, — one  being  national  legislation 
looking  toward  a  ten-year  closed  season  on  fur  seals  under  the  control  of 
the  United  States;  the  other  an  active  campaign  to  have  set  aside  in  the 
mountains  of  Montana,  including  the  Lake  Macdonald  District,  a  large 
area  of  the  public  domain  as  a  public  park,  to  be  controlled  as  is  the 
Yellowstone  Park  in  Wyoming.  The  plan  contemplates  taking  up  as 
rapidly  as  possible  the  better  protection  of  game  birds  and  other  phases 
of  the  subject. 

The  members  of  the  Committee  above  mentioned  are  under  agreement 
to  pursue  this  work  energetically  not  only  in  Washington,  but  also  by 
correspondence  with  men  of  influence  in  other  parts  of  the  country,  and 
by  co-operating  with  officers  of  other  societies  who  are  in  active  sympathy 
with  the  desired  result.  Inasmuch  as  these  gentlemen  are  willing  to  give 
their  time,  it  is  believed  that  others  who  are  not  in  a  position  to  take  an 
active  part,  will  be  glad  to  subscribe  a  proposed  fund  of  $2,000  to  cover 
necessary  expenses. 

The  undersigned  have  consented  to  become  members  of  a  finance  com¬ 
mittee  to  raise  this  amount  for  the  purpose  stated,  and  are  glad  to  under¬ 
take  the  work.  We  wish  to  assure  you  as  a  fellow  sportsman,  that  we 
will  greatly  appreciate  any  subscription  towards  this  fund  that  you  may 
care  to  make.  Checks  may  be  drawn  to  the  order  of  B.  Dominick,  Jr. 
Treas.,  and  mailed  to  him  at  his  address  in  envelope  which  we  enclose. 

We  trust  you  will  join  us.

WASHINGTON.  Jan.  17.— Allegations 
of  a  sensational  character  reflecting 
upon  former  high  officials  and  agents 
of  the  American  Government,  as  well 
as  upon  men  Interested  in  the  North 
American  Commercial  Company  of  San 
Francisco,  are  embraced  in  two  reports 
made  public  to-day  by  Representative 
John  H.  Rothermel  of  Pennsylvania. 
Chairman  of  the  House  Committee  on 
Expenditures  in  the  Department  of 
Commerce. 

These  reports  were  made  to  the  House

January  18,  1914. 


necessary.”121  A  congressional  hearing  on  the  matter 
which  opened  on  May  21,  1911,  and  closed  on 
March  14,  1914,  resulted  in  a  two-volume,  1,948- 
page  testimony  about  fur  sealing.  Secretary  Nagel 
submitted  more  than  1,200  pages  of  documents 
claiming  to  represent  every  report,  letter,  and  other 
miscellaneous  document  written  by  the  seal  agents 
to  the  department  from  January  1,  1904,  to  June  24, 
1911.  Nagel’s  compilation  became  Appendix  A  to 
the  Hearings  on  House  Resolution  no.  73.  Appendix 
A  is  an  extremely  valuable  historical  compilation  for 
the  period  covered. 

Subsequent  to  the  Hearings  on  House  Resolution 
no.  73,  Congress  passed  legislation  placing  a  five- 
year  moratorium  on  the  killing  of  fur  seals.  The  goal 
of  Henry  W.  Elliott  and  the  Camp-Fire  Club  was 
achieved,  although  many  lasting  wounds  resulted 
from  the  verbal  fisticuffs.  The  hearings  opened 
the  way  for  negotiations,  drafting,  and  ratification 
by  Congress  and  the  President  of  a  fur-seal  treaty 
signed  by  Russia,  Great  Britain,  Japan  and  the 
United  States.  The  treaty  is  popularly  referred  to 
as  the  Fur-Seal  Treaty  of  19 11, 122  or  North  Pacific 
Fur-Seal  Treaty,123  but  more  accurately  it  is  “the 
convention  ...  for  the  preservation  and  protec¬ 
tion  of  the  fur  seals  and  sea  otter  which  frequent 
the  water  of  the  north  Pacific  Ocean”124  or  Fur-Seal 
Convention}23  The  convention  was  signed  on  July  7, 
1911,  and  ratified  by  Congressional  Statute  (37  Stat. 
499)  on  August  24,  1912, 126  with  all  the  provisions 
sought  by  Elliott  and  Hornaday. 

Hornaday  summarized  the  impact  on  his  social 
well-being  years  after  the  “war”  ended:  “The  cost 
to  me  in  old  friendships  forever  broken  was  great. 
Even  today  [1931]  it  is  painful  to  contemplate.  I 
have  many  ex-friends  who  never  will  forgive  me  for 
having  started  that  fur-seal  salvage  campaign,  nor 
for  its  having  been  successful.”127

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Hoverson,  Carl  M.  (1901-1982) 

Teacher  and  Radio  Operator,  St.  Paul  Island,  1936-1941 

Acting  Agent  and  Storekeeper,  December  1 941 -October  1 942 

Storekeeper,  Funter  Bay,  Alaska,  June-December  1943 

Bureau  of  Fisheries,  Agent  and  Caretaker,  St.  George  Island,  April  1944-1949 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Carl  Hoverson  was  St.  George  agent  and  caretaker  when  the  Pribilovians  were  repatriat¬ 
ed  to  their  St.  George  Island  home  after  being  sent  to  Funter  Bay  during  WWII.  Eloquent 
descriptions  of  the  Aleuts’  return  appear  in  several  works,  such  as  Dean  Kohlhoff ’s  When 
the  Wind  Was  a  River  (pp.  148-149).  Agent  Hoverson  accompanied  the  island’s  Natives 
on  the  voyage  home.  The  transport  William  L.  Thompson  first  anchored  at  St.  Paul  Island 
during  the  evening  of  May  13,  1944,  and  because  of  rough  water  there  it  remained  at  St. 
Paul  until  the  late  evening  of  May  24,  when  it  then  traveled  to  St.  George.  During  the  in¬ 
terim,  a  group  of  men  traveled  to  St.  George  to  make  ready  as  best  as  possible  before  the 
arrival  of  the  larger  community. 

The  morning  of  May  19,  a  small  advance  working  party  left  Village  Cove  [St.  Paul  Is.] 
aboard  the  escort  vessel  USCG  ATLANTA,  for  St.  George  Island.  The  ATLANTA  arrived 
at  Garden  Cove  at  noon.  No  landing  could  be  made  on  the  village  side  because  of  the  rough 
sea  [but]  all  passengers  were  ashore  and  had  started  for  the  village  at  3  P.M.  The  ATLANTA 
left  for  St.  Paul. 

The  purpose  of  this  small  working  party  was  to  prepare  the  village  for  the  arrival  of  the 
main  group  of  people  who  were  still  aboard  the  transport  anchored  at  St.  Paul  Island. 

Many  tasks  were  accomplished  in  the  space  of  a  few  days.  It  was  necessary  to  cut  through 
16  inches  of  ice  before  water  could  be  pumped  into  the  storage  tanks.  The  wooden  water- 
main  was  tapped  in  two  places  so  that  the  frozen  sections  could  be  by-passed.  Water  was 
brought  to  the  village  through  connected  sections  of  garden  hose  so  that  the  hot-water 
heating  systems  could  be  filled.  Broken  pipes  and  castings  were  repaired  or  replaced. 

Bidarrah  covers  were  patched  and  placed  on  their  frames,  and  repairs  were  made  to 
disabled  trucks  so  that  cargo  work  could  begin  promptly  as  soon  as  the  ship  reached  the 
island.  Stoves  were  installed  in  various  places.  Fires  were  built  in  heaters  and  heating 
systems  of  all  the  houses  so  that  the  dwellings  would  be  warm  and  dry  for  their  incoming 
occupants.  The  light  plants  were  tested  and  the  cold  storage  system  put  into  operation. 

At  10:30  P.M.,  May  24,  the  WILLIAM  L.  THOMPSON  arrived  off  Village  Landing  [St. 

George]  but,  because  of  the  rough  sea,  no  cargo  nor  passengers  could  be  taken  ashore. 

Violent  seas  continued  and  it  was  not  until  May  27  that  all  of  the  people  could  be  brought 
to  land  [at  Zapadni].128 

Agent  and  Caretaker  Hoverson’s  annual  report  spoke  with  cautious  optimism  of  the 
return. 

When  the  natives  returned  from  their  sojourn  in  southeastern  Alaska,  it  was  the  attitude,  in 
some  quarters,  that  the  people  would  be  restless  and  discontented  with  their  former  mode 
of  life  and  that  they  would  leave  or  have  an  intense  longing  to  leave  for  the  comparatively 
larger  sphere  of  activity  in  other  regions  again. 

Fortunately,  this  school  of  thought  has  proven  to  be  without  premise.  The  natives  were 
happy  to  return  to  their  home  soil.  None  of  them  have  expressed  any  desire  to  forsake 
their  island  for  a  precarious  existence  elsewhere.  Many  of  them  have  been  anxious  and 


318 


Biographies  H  ♦  Hoverson 


concerned  about  their  kinfolk  who  did  not  return  with  the  rehabilitation  group.  They 
realize  that,  although  there  may  not  be  quite  the  freedom  of  action,  there  is  much  greater 
security  here. 

The  native  homes  are  clean  and  well-cared  for,  and  the  people  are  proud  of  their  dwellings. 
Some  of  the  houses  are  too  congested,  but  this  condition  can  be  fully  corrected  only  by  the 
construction  of  additional  residences.  The  inconvenience  and  lack  of  privacy  caused  by 
overcrowding  has  been  alleviated,  in  some  instances,  by  alterations.  However,  this  is  not 
the  answer  to  the  whole  problem. 

The  Women’s  Sewing  Club  was  reorganized  early  last  fall,  and  this  organization  has  been 
active  and  diligent.  Their  meetings  are  held  in  the  sewing  room  of  the  School. 

Other  forms  of  recreation  or  social  activity  have  been:-skating,  skiing,  dancing,  and 
basketball.  Two  of  the  men  are  particularly  interested  in  photography. 

An  effort  was  made  to  reorganize  the  Community  Club  but  to  no  avail.  The  older  men,  who 
are  now  in  the  majority,  were  either  tepid  in  their  enthusiasm  or  ill-disposed  towards  the 
matter.  The  outcome  of  the  discussion  was  that  the  club  would  be  reorganized  as  soon  as 
the  young  men  return  from  the  army.  A  community  club  is  a  valuable  asset  to  a  village  such 
as  this.  It  is  an  organization  where,  among  other  things,  civic  problems  are  discussed  and 
acted  upon;  it  can  be  a  powerful  influence  for  progress  and  public  good. 

Seventeen  of  the  St.  George  native  men  are  now  in  the  Armed  Forces.  The  absence  of  so 
many  not  only  severely  reduces  the  size  of  the  working  gang  but  cripples  social  life  of  the 
island.  It  is  probable  that  more  of  the  boys  will  be  inducted  before  the  war  terminates. 

The  general  health  of  the  village  has  been  much  better  than  it  was  at  Funter,  where  living 
conditions  were  depressive.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


The  disposition  of  the  people  is  good.  This  is  reflected  in  the  interest  taken  in  the 
improvement  of  their  houses  and  the  attitude  towards  the  work  of  the  island.  There  have 
been  difficulties  and  vexing  problems  to  be  faced  and  solved,  but  such  are  incident  to  every 
community.129 

Hoverson’s  annual  report  continued  with  “Comments  and  Recommendations,”  in¬ 
cluding: 

St.  George  Island  was  vacated  by  its  inhabitants  for  a  period  of  almost  two  years. 

Deterioration  coupled  with  abuse  of  equipment  in  that  space  of  time  has  resulted  in  a  huge 
backlog  of  repair  work.  As  stated  before,  the  exterior  of  every  building  in  the  village  needs 
paint,  roads  are  in  bad  shape,  and  machinery  is  in  a  precarious  condition. 

Before  the  people  were  evacuated,  every  truck  had  been  overhauled  and  was  in  good  shape. 

At  the  beginning  of  rehabilitation,  not  a  truck  on  the  place  was  in  serviceable  condition. 

The  vehicles  had  been  used  roughly  during  the  army  occupancy  and  what  repair  work  had 
been  done  was  no  longer  apparent. 

Twice  this  past  winter  cargo  was  handled  at  Zapadni.  There  is  no  dock  at  this  place  nor 
[are]  there  any  boat  ways  for  launching  the  lighters  [bidarrahs].  Boxes,  crates,  and  other 
items  of  freight  have  to  be  pulled  and  pushed  across  the  rocks.  Containers  break  open  and 
goods  are  damaged. . . .  The  construction  of  a  dock  and  boat  ways  at  this  location  is  sorely 
needed. . . . 

Additional  native  houses  have  become  a  necessity.  Three  of  the  residences  now  house 
two  families,  each.  Two  families  living  in  a  four  or  five-room  house  with  no  basement 
nor  upstairs  results  in  over-crowding,  lack  of  privacy,  discontentment,  and  irritability. 

Marriages  are  contemplated  by  several  of  the  native  soldiers  when  they  return  after  their 
service  in  the  Army.  At  least  six  new  native  houses  should  be  constructed. 

To  relieve  the  congestion,  some  of  the  present  native  dwellings  have  had  a  room  built  into 
the  upstairs.  Such  a  room  is  not  always  so  satisfactory  because  of  the  low-gabled  roofs. 

When  additional  houses  are  built  the  pitch  of  the  roof  should  be  steeper.  The  building 
should  be  a  four- room  affair  with  an  upstairs  room  and  cement  basement.130

Howes,  Osborn(e)  Jr.  (1846-1907) 

Sealer,  St.  George  Island,  1868 
Editor,  Boston  Herald 

Genealogy 

Osborn(e)  Howes  Jr.  was  born  December  8,  1846,  at  Yarmouth,  Massachusetts,  the  son 
of  Boston  shipping  merchant  Captain  Osborn  Howes  (1806-1893)  and  Abigail  Kelley 
(Cowell)  Howes.  Howes  Jr.  married  Grace  Bartow,  twenty-four-year-old  daughter  of  John 
and  Catherine  Bartow,  at  Buffalo,  New  York,  February  3,  1875.  The  marriage  was  re¬ 
corded  both  in  Boston  and  in  Buffalo,  New  York,  with  the  change  in  the  spelling  from 
“Osborn”  to  “Osborne.”  Osborne  and  Grace  Howes  had  four  children  born  at  Boston: 
Osborne  III,  born  August  6,  1877  (d.  1934),  married  Mildred  Cox,  daughter  of  William 
Emerson  Cox  and  Josephine  (Nickerson)  Cox;  Natalie,  born  November  3, 1880,  died  1889; 
Gretchen,  born  March  2,  1884,  married  Charles  Sidney  on  October  1,  1907,  at  Brookline, 
Massachusetts;  and  Kenneth,  born  January  11,  1886,  married  Edith  Forbes  Perkins  on 
January  21,  1922,  at  Framingham,  Massachusetts.  Osborn(e)  Howes  Jr.  died  April  9,  1907, 
in  Brookline,  Massachusetts.131

Biographies  H  ♦  Hoverson  -  Howes 


Biography 

The  Howes  family  had  settled  about  1635  on  Cape  Cod,  Massachusetts,  where  the  fam¬ 
ily  s  sea  captains  became  well  known.  By  1818,  with  the  Howes  family  settled  in  Boston,  a 
young  Osborn  Sr.  began  sailing  on  merchant  ships  for  Thomas  B.  Curtis.  In  1840,  “Osborn 
Howes  of  Boston,  the  first  American  captain  to  set  foot  in  Turkey,  formed  with  his  broth- 
er-in  law  the  firm  of  Howes  &  Crowell,  trading  with  China,  Western  Europe,  California, 
and  Australia.  132  The  shipping  house  of  Howes  &  Crowell  was  known  for  twenty-five 
years  as  “one  of  the  leading  firms  in  that  business  in  the  United  States.”133  By  1875,  Osborn 
Howes  Jr.  added  the  letter  “e”  to  Osborn(e).  We  can  only  assume  he  did  so  to  eliminate 
confusion  after  he  became  involved  in  the  family  business. 

In  1868,  while  in  California  on  business  for  his  father,  Osborn  Jr.  was  hired  by  Parrott 
Company  of  Connecticut  as  supercargo  on  a  whaling  vessel  headed  to  Alaska.  He  de¬ 
scribed  his  Alaska  experiences  in  articles  titled  “The  Fur  Seal  Fishery  in  Alaska”  and  “An 
Adventure  in  the  Behring  Sea.”  He  would  later  become  editor  of  the  Boston  Herald,  a 
lawyer,  and  a  leading  businessman  of  Boston.134 

On  April  10,  1907,  the  New  York  Times  printed  an  obituary  for  Osborn  Howes  Jr.  that 
read  in  part: 

Osborn  Howes,  Secretary  of  the  Boston  Board  of  Fire  Underwriters,  Japanese  Consul  for 
this  city,  and  a  well-known  newspaper  man,  died. . . .  Mr.  Howes  made  a  particular  study  of 
municipal  government  and  was  one  of  the  special  committee  in  1884  which  prepared  the 
present  city  charter.  He  was  a  life-long  Democrat  and  on  several  occasions  unsuccessfully 
contested  the  Senatorial  seat  in  Brookline.135 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Osborne  Howes  Jr.  wrote  of  his  experiences  in  the  Pribilof  Islands: 

I  left  San  Francisco  early  in  March  on  board  a  schooner  cleared  by  Messrs.  Parrott  &  Co. 
of  that  city,  for  a  trading  voyage  in  Bering  Sea  and  the  coast  of  Kamchatka.  It  was  the  first 
vessel  to  reach  the  island,  arriving  at  St.  George,  in  the  latter  part  of  April.  I  was  landed 
with  the  goods,  and  the  schooner  continued  on  her  voyage  toward  the  coast  of  Kamchatka. 

I  immediately  secured  possession  of  the  salt  house  and  the  services  of  the  natives  for  the 
season. 

In  a  few  days  a  schooner  representing  the  firm  of  Hutchinson,  Kohl,  &  Co.  also  landed 
representatives  on  St.  George  Island.  Not  long  after  the  arrival  of  this  second  schooner 
a  third,  in  the  interest  of  the  firm  of  Williams  &  Haven,  landed  men  on  the  opposite  side 
of  the  island,  at  Zapadni  rookery.  This  firm  had  headquarters  on  St.  Paul  Island.  It  was 
impossible  for  these  separate  interests  to  carry  on  their  operations  independently,  and 
they  therefore  placed  their  business  under  my  charge.  Drives  were  made  alternately  for  the 
different  companies  and  the  natives  employed  in  turn. 

Before  the  season  was  well  under  way  a  fourth  expedition  was  landed  on  the  south  side  of 
the  island  across  the  point  from  East  rookery.  There  were  three  men  in  the  party,  and  they 
set  about  killing  the  seals  on  the  rookery  without  driving  them.  The  natives  objected  to 
this  because  it  involved  the  killing  of  females.  The  men  were  remonstrated  with,  but  were 
obdurate.  One  was  bribed  off  by  the  promise  of  double  wages,  but  the  other  two  continued 
their  work.  They  were  finally  taken  prisoners  and  sent  off  to  Sitka  by  the  first  schooner  that 
touched  at  the  island.  With  them  were  returned  the  men  brought  from  Sitka,  who  were 
found  to  be  unsuited  for  the  work.  When  the  captain  of  the  schooner  whose  men  were 
interfered  with  arrived  in  the  fall  for  his  cargo  of  skins  he  was  pacified  by  being  allowed  to

take  the  results  of  one  big  drive  made  by  the  natives 
for  his  benefit. 

The  work  of  the  sealing  was  carried  out  by 
the  natives  under  the  direction  of  their  chief. 
Representatives  of  the  different  companies  did  not 
concern  themselves  with  the  work  of  driving  or 
killing.  They  simply  paid  the  natives  so  much  per 
skin— 30  to  35  cents— payment  being  made  in  trade 
goods.  The  natives  evidently  followed  the  traditions 
of  earlier  days  in  their  work.  They  seemed  very 
jealous  and  careful  of  the  seals,  avoiding  any 
disturbance  of  the  breeding  grounds.  Their 
objection  to  the  methods  of  killing  on  East  rookery 
was  based  upon  the  ground  that  if  the  females  were 
killed  there  would  be  no  seals  in  the  years  to  come. 

Most  of  the  seals  killed  were  taken  from  North 
rookery  and  Zapadni.  No  drives  were  made  from 
Staraya  Artel.  Only  occasional  drives  were  made 
from  East  rookery.  All  the  animals  were  killed  on 
the  ground  below  the  village. 

Each  man  knocked  down  his  own  allowance  of 
seals  and  skinned  them  afterwards.  Sixty  was 
considered  the  usual  day’s  work  for  a  man.  The 
rule  of  the  companies  was  that  skins  too  small,  too 
large,  or  cut  would  not  be  accepted  or  paid  for.  The 
sealers  were  therefore  very  careful  in  the  work.  A 
day’s  killing  averaged  from  800  to  1,800.  There  were 
about  thirty  available  men  among  the  natives. 

Of  the  conditions  on  St.  Paul  I  heard  only  indirectly 
through  the  representatives  of  Williams  &  Haven, 
who  in  their  work  were  evidently  directed  by 
instruction  from  the  head  station  on  St.  Paul,  where 
the  same  methods  were  probably  employed.  The  Williams  &  Haven  and  Hutchinson,  Kohl 
&  Co.’s  interests  were  supreme  on  St.  Paul,  and  they  divided  the  rookeries  between  them. 

To  the  best  of  my  recollection  1 15,000  were  taken  on  St.  George  and  250,000  on  St.  Paul 
during  the  season.136 

From  its  timing  and  contents  we  believe  an  unsigned  article,  “An  Adventure  in 
Behring  Sea,”  printed  in  the  New  York  Times  on  August  4,  1872,  was  written  by  Osborne 
Howes  Jr.  Whether  fact  or  fiction  as  regards  its  central  life-and-death  narrative,  it  is  grip¬ 
ping  and  wonderfully  descriptive. 

AN  ADVENTURE  IN  BEHRING  SEA 

In  the  spring  of  1868,  the  territory  formally  known  as  Russian  America  was  ceded  to  the 
United  States,  and  all  the  trading  privileges  which  before  had  been  held  by  the  Russian 
American  Fur  Company,  were  thrown  open  to  the  world.  Little  was  known  of  the  country 
even  in  our  Pacific  sea  ports;  true,  the  Western  Union  Telegraph  Company  had  explored 
certain  parts  of  it  in  their  attempt  to  open  communication  with  Asia,  but  they  had  confined 
themselves  more  to  its  geographical  bearings  than  its  resources;  American  whalers,  in  their 
cruises  after  oil  had  entered  every  gulf  and  bay  on  its  coast;  but  as  they  had  been  debarred 
from  landing  except  when  in  need  of  wood  and  water,  their  knowledge  beyond  that  of 
locality,  was  extremely  slight.  Of  course  many  reports  were  in  circulation  respecting  the 
wonderful  quantity  and  quality  of  the  furs  obtained  there,  but  all  of  them  of  a  vague  and

uncertain  character;  however,  the  people  of  the  coast  and  of  San  Francisco  in  particular, 
quickly  prepared  to  take  advantage  of  any  opening  that  might  show  itself;  merchants  began 
fitting  out  small  vessels  to  trade  there;  old  miners  who  had  “done”  California  and  Nevada, 
gathered  their  traps  together  for  a  prospecting  tour  to  this  new  field  of  enterprise;  land 
speculators  hurried  to  stake  out  claims  near  the  little  towns  of  Sitka  and  Kodiak;  needy 
adventurers  by  the  score  crowded  every  means  of  transportation,  most  of  them  careless  or 
ignorant  of  future  prospects,  but  going  in  the  hope  that  some  good  would  come  of  it. 

A  desire  to  see  the  world,  which  had  already  taken  me  over  the  greater  portions  of  it, 
landed  me  in  the  Winter  of  the  above  year  in  San  Francisco.  Whatever  wish  I  may  have 
had  to  remain  permanently  in  that  delightful  place  was  quickly  taken  out  of  my  head  when 
the  opportunity  presented  itself  of  going  to  the  unknown  northern  region.  The  way  in 
which  this  happened  was  as  follows:  A  number  of  gentlemen  had  fitted  out  a  schooner, 
the  Katie  for  a  sealing  and  trading  voyage  but  just  as  she  was  on  the  point  of  departure  the 
supercargo  [manager  of  a  vessel’s  cargo]  was  taken  sick  and  they  had  to  delay  sailing  until 
they  could  find  someone  to  fill  his  place.  Hearing  of  this,  I  offered  my  services  and  though  I 
possessed  but  few  of  the  requirements  necessary  for  the  situation  I  was  accepted  as  the  best 
substitute  they  could  readily  obtain. 

Why  describe  the  sea  voyage?  They  are  all  very  similar;  the  alternation  of  wind  and  calm; 
the  ineffable  glories  of  a  sunrise;  the  quenching  as  it  were  of  the  molten  orb  in  the  water  at 
evening;  the  golden  pathway  made  by  the  moon  across  the  restless  sea;  all  of  these  can  be 
seen  in  any  vessel  and  in  any  clime.  Let  it  suffice,  therefore,  to  say  that  on  the  2nd  of  May, 
after  a  fair  run  of  three  weeks,  we  came  to  anchor  off  the  island  of  St.  George,  in  the  south 
eastern  portion  of  Behring  Sea.  It  had  been  a  foggy  day,  but  the  wind  had  partially  cleared 
the  air,  and  we  could  see  quite  plainly  the  outline  of  the  jagged  cliffs  and  wild  hilltops 
covered  with  snow. 

It  was  our  intention  to  erect  a  station  on  this  island,  enter  into  an  agreement  with  the 
natives,  and  thereby,  being  the  first  comers,  secure  a  monopoly  of  the  fur  seals  which  come 
there  yearly  in  large  numbers.  In  carrying  out  our  design  we  were  eminently  successful,  and 
finding  that  this  was  to  constitute  the  principal  part  of  our  business,  I  concluded  to  let  the 
schooner  make  the  rest  of  the  voyage  (which  was  to  extend  to  the  coast  of  Siberia)  without 
me,  and  to  stay  on  the  island  in  order  to  more  effectually  superintend  the  business;  so, 
having  landed  a  large  quantity  of  goods  and  provisions,  the  schooner  prepared  to  take  her 
departure. 

It  was  a  mournful  day  to  me,  when,  having  bade  the  captain  and  their  interpreter  good- 
by,  I  saw  them  row  out  through  the  surf,  and  watched  them  until  they  disappeared  in  the 
eddying  mist,  which  had  already  hidden  the  Katie  from  sight.  They  were  not  to  return 
until  the  latter  part  of  November,  nearly  seven  months,  and  it  would  be  difficult  for  the 
reader  to  realize  the  feeling  of  loneliness  that  now  took  possession  of  me.  I  was  entirely 
isolated,  having  no  one  with  whom  I  could  associate  but  the  native  Aleuts,  whose  language 
I  understood  but  very  imperfectly.  However,  there  was  nothing  to  do  but  to  make  the 
best  of  it  and  I  therefore  determined  to  thoroughly  survey  the  island,  as  a  means  of 
occupying  my  mind  for  two  or  three  weeks  until  the  seals  should  begin  to  arrive.  Though 
but  a  small  place,  it  was  certainly  a  wild  one;  centuries  of  rough  change  by  the  elements 
had  so  diversified  its  naturally  irregular  outlines  as  to  leave  it  one  mass  of  steep  hills 
interconnected  by  long  dark  valleys.  With  the  exception  of  three  or  four  little  strips  of 
beach,  high  cliffs  best  led  out  over  the  water  at  almost  every  point,  and  into  the  rocky 
caverns  at  their  base  the  sea  clashed  and  thundered  with  a  perpetual  roar.  So  rocky  was  the 
soil  that  I  could  not  find  even  a  shrub,  though  in  the  Summer  months  long  rank  grasses 
grow  everywhere  in  great  abundance.  Overhead  hung  almost  a  perpetual  fog-bank,  making 
the  day  well  nigh  as  gloomy  as  the  night;  sometimes  the  mists  would  scatter  for  a  day  or 
two  and  I  could  see  far  across  the  water  to  the  northward  the  tops  of  the  hills  on  the  island 
of  St.  Paul,  another  seal-island  considerably  larger  than  St.  George. 

The  natives  were  very  kind  and  good-natured;  every  day  they  would  go  far  across  the  hills 
and  return  laden  with  different  kinds  of  game  or  with  eggs  of  sea-fowl,  which  they  obtained

by  being  lowered  a  hundred  feet  or  more  down  the  face  of  the  cliff,  and  would  always  bring 
them  to  me  in  order  that  I  might  have  the  first  choice.  I  soon  became  well  acquainted  with 
all  the  inhabitants  upon  the  island;  attended  the  little  receptions  they  gave  upon  their 
“name’s  day”,  as  it  is  called  by  the  Russians;  acted  as  godfather  for  their  children  when 
they  were  christened — for  all  the  Aleutians  are  members  of  the  Greek  Church — on  which 
occasions  I  yet  further  endeared  myself  to  them  by  keeping  “open  house”  and  providing  an 
unlimited  amount  of  tea,  sugar  and  crackers  for  their  entertainment.  When  the  seals  came 
there  was  work  enough  to  do;  what  with  driving,  killing,  salting  and  packing,  keeping  store, 
acting  as  governor,  doctor  and  adviser.  I  had  my  time  fully  taken  up;  and  so  months  went 
by,  the  seasons  passed  over,  and  I  began  counting  the  weeks  that  must  elapse  before  the 
Katie  would  return  to  take  on  board  the  large  lot  of  furs  we  had  collected  and  stored  in  the 
Lefka  (hut  made  of  earth)  on  the  beach. 

One  night  in  the  middle  of  October  I  was  awakened  from  my  sleep  by  someone  coming 
into  my  little  cabin  and  roughly  shaking  me  by  the  shoulder.  Starting  up,  I  saw  by  a  strange 
glare  of  light  that  seemed  to  fill  the  room,  the  Nirachie,  or  head  native  on  the  island.  He 
made  an  ineffectual  attempt  to  speak  and  pointed  with  his  hand  to  the  window,  while  his 
face  wore  an  expression  of  inevitable  fear  and  consternation.  In  an  instant  I  was  at  the 
window;  both  heaven  and  earth  seemed  one  blaze  of  light,  and  for  a  moment,  I  thought 
that  the  old  volcano,  which  had  slumbered  for  ages  beneath  the  island,  had  again  started  to 
life.  A  second  glance,  however,  brought  to  my  mind  the  hardly  more  deniable  conviction, 
that  the  storehouse,  containing  our  entire  supply  of  provisions  and  the  adjoining  outhouses 
filled  with  salted  seals  which  the  natives  had  prepared  for  their  Winter’s  sustenance,  were 
wrapped  in  a  sheet  of  flame. 

Now  that  two  years  had  passed,  and  I  am  sitting  in  my  quiet  library  writing  this,  I  cannot 
recall  my  feelings  at  that  moment  without  experiencing  a  thrill  of  horror.  A  bitter  cold  gale 
blew  from  the  north,  laden  with  the  inevitable  mist,  which  though  it  prevented  the  fire 
from  being  seen  at  any  distance,  served  by  its  refractions  to  fill  with  redoubled  intensity  of 
light  the  little  space  in  which  it  was  visible. 

When  I  reached  the  spot  the  natives  had  all  arrived,  but  too  terror-stricken  for  motion, 
were  stupidly  gazing  at  the  great  surging  flames,  which  they  now  beheld  for  the  first  time  in 
their  lives.  Of  custom,  my  first  cry  was  for  water.  We  were  wholly  unprepared  for  anything 
of  this  kind;  the  pond  from  which  we  obtained  our  supply  of  fresh  water  was  more  than 
half  a  mile  distant  and  it  was,  therefore,  out  of  the  question  to  go  there;  the  sea,  however 
was  within  300  yards  of  the  building,  but  in  order  to  reach  it,  it  was  necessary  to  descend 
a  steep  narrow  path,  leading  down  the  side  of  a  cliff,  difficult  during  the  day,  but  at  night 
dangerous.  Still  it  must  be  done  and  in  less  than  two  minutes  I  had  all  the  inhabitants  of 
the  village — men,  women  and  children — with  the  exception  of  three  or  four  of  the  older 
men,  whom  I  kept  to  assist  me  in  breaking  out  some  of  the  goods,  dispatched  to  obtain  the 
precious  liquid. 

All  our  exertions  proved  wholly  futile;  the  fire,  when  discovered,  was  under  too  great 
headway  to  be  subdued  by  any  of  the  rude  appliances  we  could  command,  and  with  the 
exception  of  three  boxes  of  hard  bread,  which  I  succeeded  to  breaking  out,  the  entire 
building,  with  outhouses  and  contents  was  reduced  to  a  smoldering  heap  before  our  eyes. 

It  was  about  3  o’clock  in  the  morning  when  I  told  the  natives,  who  now  that  the  first 
excitement  had  passed,  were  making  loud  lamentations  that  they  had  better  go  to  their 
homes  and  get  rested,  and  that  I  would  tell  them  after  I  had  had  time  to  think  it  over,  what 
had  best  be  done.  For  me  it  was  no  time  for  resting;  my  mind  was  well  nigh  paralyzed 
by  the  sudden  calamity  that  had  overtaken  me,  and  it  was  long  before  I  could  collect  my 
thoughts  sufficiently  to  give  the  subject  reasonable  consideration.  What  was  to  be  done! 
Both  seals  and  birds  had  left  us  for  their  Winter’s  sojourn  in  a  milder  climate— fish  there 
were  none,  for  the  seals  had  driven  them  away — there  was  absolutely  nothing  on  the  island 
that  we  could  use  for  food.

The  natives  had  made  their  weekly  purchase  of  provisions  five  days  before,  and  I  knew  from 
their  natural  improvidence  that  they  could  not  have  more  than  two  days  ordinary  supply 
on  hand;  in  my  own  house  I  had  enough  to  keep  them  for  three  or  four  days  more — but 
what  then?  The  Katie  would  not  return  for  five  weeks  and  head  winds  might  delay  her  two 
or  three  weeks  longer.  What  were  we  to  live  upon  in  the  meantime!  We  must  certainly  go 
to  St.  Paul,  which  was  the  only  settlement  within  attainable  distance  to  procure  food;  but 
then  the  equally  perplexing  question  arose,  how  should  we  get  there?  St.  Paul  was  only 
forty  miles  away  and  in  good  weather,  with  an  ordinary  ship’s  boat,  I  should  have  thought 
nothing  of  the  trip;  but  at  this  season  of  the  year  fair  weather  was  exceptionable  and  our 
only  means  of  conveyance  was  a  bidara  or  Aleutian  skin-boat.  This  was  a  large  ungainly 
craft,  being  about  as  symmetrically  formed  as  a  child’s  Noah’s  ark.  It  was  made  of  a  rude 
framework  of  drift-wood  and  whalebone  covered  with  the  skins  of  the  sea-lion,  which  had 
been  dried  in  the  sun  and  sewn  together;  it  was  about  thirty  feet  long,  by  twelve  foot  beam, 
and  propelled  by  oars,  yet  carried  a  small  square  sail  to  be  used  when  the  wind  was  directly 
aft.  On  discharging  our  vessel  we  had  found  it  very  useful  but  though  very  seaworthy  when 
newly  oiled,  after  it  had  been  in  the  water  a  few  hours  the  skin  covering  became  damp 
and  rotten,  so  that  a  very  slight  pressure  would  break  it;  yet  this  was  the  only  means  of 
transportation  we  had,  and  go  we  must. 

In  the  morning  I  assembled  all  the  natives,  and  having  told  them  the  plan  I  had  decided 
upon,  made  them  bring  all  the  food  they  had  in  their  houses  which  with  what  I  had,  I 
placed  under  the  charge  of  the  Nirachie  in  order  that  regular  rations  might  be  served  out 
and  nothing  wasted.  It  required  sixteen  men  to  man  the  bidara,  and,  that  no  hard  feeling 
might  be  created,  I  let  the  able-bodied  men  of  the  village,  amounting  altogether  to  forty, 
draw  lots  in  order  to  see  which  of  them  should  go  on  the  expedition.  Having  decided  this, 
and  seen  that  the  best  was  put  in  proper  condition  for  the  trip,  I  sat  down  and  wrote  a  letter 
containing  a  statement  of  our  misfortune  to  the  Captain  of  the  Katie  so  that  in  case  we 
should  never  return,  and  upon  his  arrival  he  should  find  no  one  alive  upon  the  island,  he 
might  know  the  cause  of  it;  and  I  also  told  him  that  he  would  find  the  furs  in  the  Lefka  all 
right. 

Our  wish  now  was  for  a  moderately  pleasant  day,  in  order  to  start;  and  luckily  for  us  we 
did  not  have  to  wait  long,  for  the  next  morning  brought  us  an  unusually  calm  sea,  with  a 
light  breeze  from  the  South.  Parting  kisses  and  blessings  were  given,  and  we  were  soon  off, 
steering  directly  for  our  destination,  and  going  as  fast  as  wind  and  oar  could  carry  us.  It  was 
a  delightful  day,  the  wind  staying  by  us  and  aiding  us  so  that  at  four  o’clock  in  the  afternoon 
we  landed  on  the  island  whose  dark  cliffs  we  had  seen  for  hours  rising  higher  and  higher 
out  of  the  blur  sea.  There  were  several  American  companies  on  the  island,  and  as  they 
had  an  abundant  supply  of  provisions,  I  found  no  difficulty  in  obtaining  all  I  wished;  so  we 
worked  late  into  the  night  in  getting  them  from  the  storehouse  down  to  the  landing,  that 
we  might  be  in  readiness  to  start  by  daylight,  our  skin-boat  having  been  dried  and  oiled  in 
the  meantime. 

It  was  some  time  after  midnight  when,  just  as  I  was  on  the  point  of  bidding  my  entertainers 
good-night,  and  seeking  an  hour  or  two  of  rest,  one  of  my  men,  named  Evan  Switzoff,  a 
favorite  of  mine,  came  to  me  and  said  he  would  like  to  have  me  come  to  the  church,  as  he 
was  about  to  be  married.  It  seemed  that  he  had  been  engaged  to  an  Aleutian  girl  on  St. 

Paul,  Natalia  by  name,  for  three  years,  and  that  the  present  was  the  first  time  during  this 
period  that  he  had  had  an  opportunity  of  seeing  her,  and  though  there  was  a  dangerous 
trip  home  in  anticipation,  neither  of  them  was  willing  to  allow  so  excellent  an  occasion 
for  consummating  their  long-postponed  happiness  to  pass  by  unnoticed.  I  endeavored  to 
point  out  the  danger  to  which  he  was  exposing  her  by  so  doing,  but  though  I  might  have 
convinced  him,  I  found  that  argument  was  entirely  wasted  upon  her,  and  so  gave  it  up. 

The  little  church  was  brilliantly  lighted  by  numerous  wax  candles  of  all  sizes  from  an 
immense  one  six  feet  long  and  a  foot  in  diameter  down  to  the  thin  tapers  which  some  of 
the  natives  carried  in  their  hands.  The  bride  was  wonderfully  arrayed,  considering  the 
place  and  the  short  notice  she  had  received,  being  resplendent  in  a  very  light  nicely-fitting

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


calico  dress,  with  crinoline,  a  little  white  bonnet  and  a  net  of  imitation  coral  jewelry;  but 
the  acme  of  style  was  reached  through  a  pair  of  green  kid  gloves,  in  which  the  fair  one 
had  imprisoned  her  hands  for  the  first  time.  Beside  this  “glass  of  fashion”,  poor  Evan  in 
his  pea-jacket  made  but  a  sorry  appearance;  however,  love  seemed  to  overcome  all  those 
minor  difficulties,  and  after  a  long  service,  rendered  wearisome  by  perpetual  bowings, 
but  redeemed  by  beautiful  chanting,  they  were  pronounced  man  and  wife,  and  the  whole 
company  went  to  the  bride’s  father’s  to  partake  of  such  refreshment  as  he  might  provide, 
after  which  I,  at  least,  sought  my  much-needed  rest. 

The  next  day  was  also  a  fine  one;  the  sun  rose  on  a  perfectly  calm  sea,  and,  having  bade  our 
kind  friends  adjou  [sic],  we  slowly  rowed  our  now  heavily  laden  boat  out  of  the  little  harbor. 
Hour  after  hour  passed  by,  and  though  we  did  not  progress  as  rapidly  as  when  the  boat  was 
empty,  we  still  went  along  at  a  very  good  rate  of  speed,  and  St.  Paul  was  becoming  more 
and  more  faint  in  the  distance.  Owing  to  the  immense  amount  of  labor,  both  mental  and 
physical,  I  had  performed  during  the  past  few  days,  and  the  very  small  quantity  of  rest,  I 
had  been  able  to  obtain,  I  felt  very  tired,  and  about  noon  seeing  that  all  was  going  on  well,  I 
stretched  myself  out  on  a  pile  of  boxes  so  that  I  might  get  a  little  sleep  The  sun  was  shining 
with  unprotected  supremacy,  and  I  put  my  handkerchief  over  my  face  to  protect  it  from  the 
unwanted  heat.  The  men  were  pulling  easily;  Natalia  was  seated  by  her  husband,  and,  just 
as  I  dropped  off  I  heard  her  singing  an  old  Russian  song  the  burden  of  which  was,  “Cooreet 
tropka  tobacco" 

I  must  have  slept  several  hours,  for  when  some  one  awoke  me  a  great  change  had  taken 
place.  The  sun  was  completely  lost  to  sight  by  dark  thick  folds  of  fog  which  intervened,  and 
though  there  was  as  yet  but  little  wind  our  boat  rose  and  fell  on  each  wave  of  a  long  heavy 
swell  that  came  rolling  toward  us  from  the  northward,  which  I  instantly  recognized  as  the 
precursor  of  one  of  our  fierce  gales. 

The  steersman  estimated  that  we  must  be  about  eight  miles  from  St.  George;  and  though 
he  had  been  steering  by  compass  for  an  hour  or  two  since  the  fog  settled  down  on  us, 
he  seemed  to  be  rather  uncertain  in  precisely  what  direction  our  Island  lay.  Taking  the 
large  oar  by  which  the  boat’s  course  was  directed,  I  sent  the  former  helmsman  forward  to 
help  row;  and  having  made  an  estimate  by  the  wind,  the  compass  and  my  predecessor’s 
approximations  as  to  what  our  course  should  be,  I  headed  the  boat  in  that  direction,  and 
trusted  to  good  fortune  for  a  favorable  result. 

Time  passed  away,  night  came  on,  but  we  saw  no  signs  of  the  island.  In  vain  we  strained 
our  eyes  over  the  white  caps,  which  were  now  beginning  to  crest  the  waves;  no  sight  of 
land  was  vouchsafed  to  us,  only  a  great  dread  darkness  on  every  hand.  This  soon  became 
so  intense  that  I  could  not  see  the  oarsman  nearest  to  me;  still  they  pulled  on  until  one 
of  them  cried  in  a  wild  hopeless  way,  “We  have  passed  by  the  Island!”  thus  giving  verbal 
utterance  to  a  fear  I  had  felt  but  had  not  dared  to  express.  The  rowers  stopped  and  our 
boat  losing  headway,  swung  heavily  round  into  the  trough  of  the  sea.  After  a  few  moments 
deliberation  my  mind  was  made  up.  Our  only  chance  of  escape  was,  if  possible,  to  lay  where 
we  were  until  the  morning,  and  then  endeavor  to  find  the  island;  so  I  headed  the  boat  into 
the  wind,  and  still  having  three  or  four  men  row  easily  to  keep  her  from  drifting,  let  the 
others  take  any  manner  of  rest  they  had  the  heart  for. 

But  what  a  night  it  was!  The  wind  increased  every  hour,  and  to  add  to  our  misery,  about 
midnight  our  boat  began  to  leak;  first  in  one,  and  then  in  two,  three,  four  and  five  places  in 
quick  succession,  while  at  each  lurch  the  slender  framework  would  bend  and  twist  as  if  it 
would  break  and  let  our  boat  fall  apart.  There  was  no  help  for  it— some  of  our  goods  must 
be  thrown  overboard;  so  clothing,  sugar  and  tea  were  quickly  passed  over  the  side,  and 
went  surging  along  to  the  leeward.  This  lightened  the  boat;  but  every  half  hour  showed  a 
new  leak  to  be  stopped,  while  all  the  men  were  kept  steadily  at  work  rowing,  or  bailing  out 
the  water  that  came  in  torrents  over  the  bow  and  sides.

At  last  the  day  began  to  dawn,  but  none  too  soon,  for  it  was  evident  to  me  that  we  could 
not  keep  above  water  another  hour.  With  the  growing  light  the  fog  also  lifted  for  a  time, 
and  to  our  great  delight  we  saw  the  Island  of  St.  George  under  our  lee,  only  about  a  mile  off. 

The  shouts  of  joy  from  the  natives  were,  however,  quickly  changed  to  cries  of  despair,  when 
they  saw  the  long  line  of  breakers  which,  beginning  a  quarter  of  a  mile  or  so  from  the  shore, 
swept  in  huge  white  waves  with  irresistible  force  upon  the  beach. 

If  we  were  to  land,  we  must  do  so  here.  To  go  around  to  the  leeward  side  of  the  island  while 
such  a  gale  was  blowing  would  have  been  absolutely  impossible,  even  had  our  boat  been  in 
good  condition;  as  it  was,  we  should  sink  before  we  had  made  a  tenth  of  the  distance.  To 
row  in  over  the  surf  would  result  in  complete  destruction  of  our  boat,  cargo,  and  most,  if 
not  all,  of  our  lives;  those  reaching  the  shore  having  only  a  lingering  death  by  starvation  to 
look  forward  to;  remaining  where  we  were  was  equally  certain  death.  For  the  first  time  in 
all  my  troubles  I  lost  heart  entirely.  “And  this,  thought  I,  is  the  end  of  all  my  planning,  to 
perish  miserably  when  within  sight  of  the  destination!” 

It  was  at  this  moment  of  universal  despair  that  Evan  Switzoff  prompted  to  mental  exertion 
more  by  the  presence  of  a  loved  one  than  by  any  fear  of  personal  danger  suggested  carrying 
a  surf-line  to  the  shore  and  by  its  aid  thought  that  the  boat  might  be  safely  taken  through 
the  breakers.  Surf  lines  are  often  used  whenever  it  is  necessary  for  boats  to  land  on  an 
unsheltered  beach.  It  is  merely  a  strong  rope  securely  fastened  to  a  buoy  outside  of  the 
breakers,  and  thence  carried  through  them  to  the  land,  where  it  is  also  fastened;  a  boat 
wishing  to  reach  the  shore  goes  to  the  buoy,  and  the  rope  having  been  taken  on  board,  two 
men  stand  at  the  bows,  and  two  at  the  stern,  and  pull  her  through  the  surf  stern  forward, 
in  much  the  way  small  ferry-boats  used  to  be  taken  across  our  Western  rivers;  but  should 
the  men  by  any  mischance  loose  their  hold  of  the  rope,  the  boat  will  instantly  swing  round 
and  capsize.  It  is  a  dangerous  method,  but  far  preferable  to  landing  without  it,  which  in  the 
present  case  was  impossible. 

The  idea  was  cheerfully  received — but  who  was  to  take  the  line  ashore?  One  suggested  that 
it  be  fastened  round  a  box,  and  that  the  waves  would  carry  it  to  the  beach,  where  we  could 
see  that  the  inhabitants  of  the  village  had  now  assembled,  and  that  they  would  understand 
what  it  meant,  and  would  fasten  the  line.  In  an  instant  the  natives  had  sized  a  box,  and  had 
secured  a  line  round  it  preparatory  to  throwing  it  over.  But  I  crushed  their  short-lived  hope 
by  telling,  what  was  an  only  too  obvious  fact,  that  there  was  but  little  chance  of  the  box 
ever  reaching  the  small  strip  of  beach;  in  all  probability  it  would  be  dashed  to  pieces  on  the 
long  line  of  rocks  which  stretched  for  miles  on  either  side,  in  which  case  their  friends  on 
shore  would  never  think  of  looking  for  a  line;  and  should  the  trial  meet  with  such  an  end, 
we  could  not  keep  afloat  long  enough  to  make  another,  I  ended  by  asking  for  a  volunteer  to 
undertake  the  dangerous  work. 

A  short,  though  seemingly  long  silence  followed  my  words,  each  one  looking  at  his 
neighbor  in  the  hope  that  he  would  speak;  though,  for  my  part,  the  danger  in  remaining 
seemed  fairly  as  great  as  that  of  going  and  I  would  willingly  have  volunteered  had  I  known 
how  to  swim.  At  last  the  silence  was  broken  by  a  cry  from  Natalia,  as  Evan  started  up 
and  began  throwing  off  his  clothes  while  the  rest  of  the  men,  as  if  released  from  some 
enchantment,  fell  to  work  bailing  out  the  water  which  during  their  delay  had  increased  so 
much  that  it  threatened  to  sink  us  instantly. 

We  were  now  just  outside  of  the  breakers,  so  we  let  go  the  anchor,  and  Evan,  kissing  the 
weeping  Natalia,  and  grasping  my  hand  as  I  fastened  a  line  round  his  body,  was  off.  Over 
the  waves  he  went,  now  lost  and  now  appearing;  holding  his  head  high  up  while  the  line 
which  I  had  ready  was  paying  out,  dragged  loosely  behind.  The  people  on  the  beach  seemed 
to  have  seen  him,  for  they  went  a  little  way  into  the  surf,  ready  to  seize  him  when  he  should 
come  near.  All  went  well,  and  he  was  within  one  hundred  yards  of  the  beach  when  a  huge 
wave,  which  had  well  nigh  swamped  us,  rushed  in  upon  him  towering  up  a  deceitful  mass 
of  curling  foam.  He  was  so  far  away  that  I  could  not  see  what  took  place,  but  know,  by  the 
rapidity  with  which  the  line  ran  through  my  hands  that  some  accident  had  befallen  him.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Soon  we  saw  the  natives  rush  into  the  water,  and  a  moment  after  return  and  go  higher  up 
the  beach.  Then  the  stress  upon  the  line,  which  for  a  time  had  eased,  was  renewed,  and 
feeling  certain  that  they  must  have  the  other  end,  I  made  mine  taut  to  a  stronger  rope, 
of  which,  thank  fortune,  we  had  an  abundance,  and  launched  it  over  the  side.  In  about 
ten  minutes  there  was  a  great  waving  of  coats  and  hats  on  the  beach — a  signal,  we  took 
it,  that  the  rope  had  been  received  and  made  fast;  so,  hauling  it  in  as  tightly  as  we  could, 
we  secured  it  with  a  buoy  to  the  hawser  of  the  anchor,  and  cut  ourselves  loose.  It  needed 
all  our  strength  and  skill  and  even  with  that  we  were  a  dozen  times  on  the  very  verge  of 
destruction.  But  a  good  Providence  willed  it  otherwise;  for  in  a  few  minutes  our  keep 
touched  lightly  upon  the  sand,  a  hundred  hands  seized  our  gunwale  on  both  sides  and  we 
were  run  high  and  dry  upon  the  beach. 

That  was  indeed  a  joyful  greeting.  How  many  times  I  was  embraced  and  kissed  by  men, 
women  and  children  I  cannot  tell,  and  should  be  ashamed  to  if  I  could;  but  in  all  this  I 
missed  Evan’s  face  and  my  first  inquiry  was  for  him.  Having  at  length  received  a  coherent 
direction,  I  ran  to  the  little  hut  on  the  beach,  where  I  was  told  he  lay.  But  I  was  not  the 
first;  poor  Natalia,  I  found  her  kneeling  over  the  cold,  wet  body  of  her  husband,  trying  by 
rubbing  his  face  with  her  hands,  and  by  kissing  to  bring  him  back  to  life.  I  feared  there 
was  no  hope,  still  a  moment  after  I  was  hurrying  up  the  hill  to  my  house  to  procure  some 
stimulants.  It  was  useless;  he  had  been  neglected  too  long;  and  in  humble  likeness  to  One 
far  greater,  had  saved  our  lives  at  the  cost  of  his  own. 

My  memory  will  lose  much  that  it  holds  dear  before  I  forget  the  sweet  harmony  of  those 
old  Slavonian  [sic]  chants  one  of  rejoicing  and  one  of  sorrow,  which  the  men  sang  as  they 
stood  around  the  little  hut  now,  alas,  containing  a  double  sacrifice. 

The  rest  may  be  briefly  told.  By  strict  economy  the  reduced  provisions  we  had  succeeded 
in  bringing  from  St.  Paul  proved  more  than  sufficient.  The  Katie  arrived  in  due  season, 
landing  abundant  supplies,  and  taking  on  board  in  return  the  furs  we  had  collected.  With 
the  event  my  banishment  ended,  and  on  the  2nd  of  December,  just  seven  months  after  my 
arrival,  from  the  deck  of  our  schooner,  we  hurried  southward,  I  saw  the  mist  gather  round 
that  lone  little  island  for  the  last  time.137

Genealogy 

Eli  Lundy  Huggins  was  born  August  1,  1842,  in  Schuyler  County,  Illinois,  son  of  the 
Reverend  Alexander  Gilliland  Huggins  and  Lydia  (Pettijohn)  Huggins.  While  stationed 
at  Kodiak,  Alaska,  Eli  Huggins  had  a  liaison  with  Alexandra  (Aleksandra)  Kashevarov  (b. 
May  15, 1846),  daughter  of  Ivan  (Ioann)  Kashevarov  and  Elisaveta  (Elizaveta)  Grigor'evna 
Klimovskoi.138  A  son,  Zinovii  (Zenoa,  Zenoah)  Alexander  “Zeno”  Kashevarov  Huggins 
(aka  Rufus  Huggins),139  was  born  to  Alexandra  on  October  8,  1870  (d.  May  31,  1955),  just 
as  Eli  was  to  leave  St.  Paul  Island.  The  son,  who  first  lived  with  a  relative  of  his  father  in 
California,  became  an  artist  and  having  married  a  French  woman  lived  most  of  his  adult 
life  in  France.  Eli  Huggins  died  October  22,  1929,  at  San  Diego,  California.140

welfare  of  the  islands’  Natives.  Lt.  Huggins  was  in  command  on  the  Pribilofs  for  three 
months,  until  September  10,  1870.142  During  his  stay  he  wrote  at  least  two  letters  and  a 
note  to  his  sisters  Fannie  and  Hattie,  who  were  living  in  California.  The  Bancroft  Library 
at  the  University  of  California,  Berkeley,  has  conserved  the  two  letters  and  note.  They  are

Saint  Paul  Island  Alaska 
July  25,  1870 

My  dear  Fannie: 

I  sent  by  the  steamer  "Alexander”  which  sailed  for  San  Francisco  last  week,  a  letter  to  Jane, 
and  100  dollars.  Since  then  nothing  worthy  of  note  has  occurred  to  me  except  a  Journey 
to  Walrus  Island  sixteen  miles  from  here.  It  was  a  cold  dreary  trip  in  an  open  boat,  but  I 
was  well  paid  for  it.  Besides  myself  were  Count  Veritenikoff  and  five  natives  who  rowed  the 
boat.  When  we  left  here  at  three  o’clock  in  the  morning  we  hoped  to  sail  most  of  the  way, 
but  the  wind  being  contrary  the  natives  had  to  row  most  of  the  way.  We  arrived  at  Walrus 
Island  at  nine  in  the  morning.  The  Island  is  half  a  mile  long  and  an  eighth  of  a  mile  in 
width.  At  this  time  of  year  it  is  covered  with  swarms  of  gulls  and  other  aquatic  fowl  who  go 
there  to  breed.  When  we  landed  on  the  island,  they  rose  in  great  clouds,  and  made  a  noise 
like  that  of  a  high  wind  in  a  forest.  We  could  hardly  step  without  breaking  the  eggs  which 
almost  covered  the  ground.  The  natives  went  to  work  and  filled  the  boat  with  eggs  as  full  as 
it  would  hold.  I  am  not  fond  of  gull  eggs,  but  can  eat  them  at  a  pinch.  They  are  dark  colored 
&  have  a  rank  flavor. 

There  were  hundreds  of  walrus  on  the  rocks  when  we  arrived  there,  but  after  shooting  a 
few  of  them  the  rest  took  to  the  water  and  did  not  come  back  till  afternoon,  when  I  shot 
one  and  took  the  tusks.  The  tusks  are  two  feet  long.  The  walrus  is  an  immense  animal, 
almost  as  large  as  an  elephant.  At  noon  the  natives  made  a  fire  of  walrus  blubber,  and  made 
tea.  They  also  cooked  eggs  and  seal  meat.  We  left  Walrus  Island  early  in  the  afternoon, 
and  reached  home  at  seven  o’clock.  The  natives  were  obliged  to  row  all  the  way  back 
against  wind  and  tide  current,  and  were  almost  exhausted  when  we  got  back.  My  most 
congenial  companion  here,  Dr.  Gildersleve,  went  to  San  Francisco  on  the  “Alexandra”

which  is  an  irreparable  loss  to  me.  The  people  left  are  but  little  company  to  me.  I  expect 
a  German  doctor  here  by  the  first  vessel.  His  name  is  Cramer.  I  have  seen  him  but  have 
not  much  acquaintance  with  him.  There  is  a  good  deal  of  sickness  among  the  natives. . . . 
Dr.  Gildersleve  attributes  this  to  their  underground  dwellings  which  are  always  damp  and 
mouldy.  They  live  in  these  underground  abodes,  not  as  I  used  to  suppose  on  account  of 
extreme  cold,  but  because  they  can  not  get  wood  on  any  of  the  Aleutian  Islands  to  build 
houses.  These  islands,  St.  Paul  and  St.  George,  were  not  inhabited  when  the  Russians  first 
discovered  them.  The  Russians  brought  natives  from  various  islands  to  live  on  them.  There 
is  one  family  here  from  Kamschatka.  They  are  very  much  darker  than  the  Aleutians,  but  I 
think  are  finer  looking.  They  have  been  here  thirty  years  and  speak  the  Aleutian  language. 


St.  Paul  Island  Alaska 
Sept.  10,  1870 

My  dear  Hattie: 

Time  passes  rapidly  away  even  in  Behrings  sea  and  by  the  time  this  reaches  you  it  will  be 
nearly  five  years  since  I  left  home.  You  have  changed  much  more  than  I  have  no  doubt.  You 
must  be  a  young  lady  grown  now.  It  seems  a  little  strange  to  me  to  think  of  you  so.  I  would 
not  have  you  here  to  remain  for  anything  but  I  often  wish  that  my  sisters  could  be  here  for 
a  few  hours  to  accompany  me  in  one  of  my  walks.  It  would  astonish  you  to  see  the  seals  I 
think.  The  young  seals  which  were  born  in  June  and  July  are  learning  to  swim  now.  It  is  a 
singular  fact  that  a  young  seal  can  not  swim,  and  would  drown  as  soon  as  an  infant  if  left 
alone  in  the  water.  They  are  now  (the  youngest  of  them)  about  six  weeks  old,  and  as  tall  as 
a  large  cat,  but  three  times  as  heavy.  The  old  males  are  as  large  as  a  horse  and  have  a  mane 
like  that  of  an  old  buffalo.  They  are  a  formidable  looking  animal,  and  if  any  one  who  had 
never  seen  or  heard  of  them  before  should  suddenly  come  upon  them  it  would  frighten  him 
as  much  as  a  pack  of  lions.  They  are  not  dangerous  though  for  they  never  fight  when  they 
have  a  chance  to  run,  and  they  move  so  slowly  on  shore  that  a  small  child  can  easily  keep 
out  of  their  way.  I  take  some  long  walks  all  alone  when  the  weather  is  fine.  Little  blue  foxes 
come  out  of  their  holes  and  bark  at  me  as  I  go  by.  They  live  on  seal  meat. 

Berries  are  ripe  on  the  island  now  and  I  see  native  women  and  girls  out  picking  them  every 
day.  There  are  two  kinds  of  berries.  I  do  not  like  either  of  them  much  except  preserved. 

One  kind  is  a  good  deal  like  a  red  raspberry  only  the  seeds  are  much  larger  and  coarser. 

The  other  kind  is  like  huckleberries.  The  women  complain  that  the  foxes  eat  more  than 
their  share  of  the  berries.  Some  of  the  natives  are  quite  industrious  and  anxious  to  improve 
their  condition  and  be  “alle  same  Americansky,”  but  there  is  not  much  chance  of  that  as 
long  as  they  are  obliged  to  live  in  underground  houses  and  burn  seal  blubber  for  fuel.  It 
makes  a  very  rank  black  smoke  which  ruins  everything  in  the  house.  There  are  not  trees  on 
the  island  so  they  will  have  to  continue  as  they  are  for  a  time  yet.  I  think  hardy  trees  would 
grow  here,  and  have  written  to  the  bureau  of  Agriculture  in  Washington  to  send  either 
young  sprouts  or  seeds  of  maple,  cottonwood.  I  think  if  there  is  any  one  here  to  take  an 
interest  in  the  matter  after  I  leave  they  can  have  large  groves  twenty  years  hence. 

The  natives  here  will  have  to  live  on  seal  meat  if  a  vessel  does  not  come  soon.  The  sugar  and 
tobacco  is  all  gone  already,  which  to  them  is  a  greater  misfortune  than  if  the  flour  was  all 
gone.  They  have  to  make  their  beer  of  berries  alone  now.  It  is  quite  intoxicating,  but  they 
like  it  better  when  they  have  sugar  to  put  in  it.

Hutchinson,  Hayward  Malcolm  (1832-1883) 

Baltimore  Merchant  and  Founder  of  Hutchinson,  Kohl  &  Company 
Secretary,  Treasurer,  and  Stockholder,  Alaska  Commercial  Company 

Genealogy 

Hayward  Malcolm  Hutchinson  was  born  January  19,  1832,  in  Milford,  New  Hampshire. 
He  was  the  son  of  David  Hutchinson  and  Elizabeth  (Hayward)  Hutchinson,  whose  origi¬ 
nal  surname  was  his  given  name.  Hayward  married  Elizabeth  Catherine  Abbott,  daughter 
of  Edwin  Abbott  and  Catherine  (Johnson)  Abbott,  on  September  7,  1859,  at  Baltimore, 
Maryland,  as  reported  in  the  Baltimore  Sun  of  September  9, 1859.  Hayward  and  Catherine 
Hutchinson  had  two  daughters:  Linda  (married  to  Charles  Ball,  and  later  to  John  S.  Webb)

and  Katie  (married  to  John  F.  Olmstead),  both  born  in  Baltimore.145  Hayward  Hutchinson 
died  at  age  fifty-one  on  May  10,  1883,  in  Washington,  D.C.,  after  he  had  “amassed  a  for- 

Biographical  Sketch 

Hayward  Hutchinson  was  educated  in  Milford’s 
one-room  Schoolhouse  #3  on  Union  Street,  a 
school  established  by  his  grandfather  Nehemiah 
Hayward.  He  completed  his  formal  education  at 
Mt.  Vernon,  New  Hampshire,  a  few  miles  from 
Milford.147 

Hutchinson  lived  in  Washington,  D.C.,  for  a 
short  time.  In  1880,  he  and  his  family  settled  on 
293  acres  purchased  in  1875  by  his  wife,  Elizabeth, 
in  the  Berry’s  District  of  Montgomery  County, 
Maryland.  The  family  established  a  home  there 
that  they  named  “Sitka  Farm.”  “He  built  a  large 
estate  on  land  that  now  comprises  the  Hillandale 
development  in  eastern  Montgomery  County  to 
the  east  of  New  Hampshire  Avenue,  just  north  of 
the  Beltway  (I-495).”148  Today,  only  the  overseer’s 
house  remains.  According  to  the  March  1976 
issue  of  The  Hillandaler,  a  Montgomery  County 
historical  newsletter,  Hutchinson  also  built  the 
Sitka  Baptist  Church  for  his  hired  black  men  and 
women  laborers.149 

The  Hutchinson  and  Hayward  families  were  active  in  many  spheres.  Their  ac¬ 
complishments  included  the  world-famous  Hutchinson  Family  Singers,  the  Bartlett  & 
Hayward  Company  of  Baltimore,  and  the  Hutchinson  &  Kohl  Company  of  California, 
which  evolved  to  become  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company. 

John  W.  Hutchinson,  as  head  of  the  Family  Singers,  was  looking  for  an  advertising 
agent  when  he  approached  his  nephew,  Hayward,  on  the  subject: 

March  14,  1853,  this  tour  ended.  We  went  home  and  at  once  began  negotiations  with 
Hayward  Hutchinson,  son  of  my  oldest  brother  David,  to  go  out  on  the  road  as  our  advance 
agent.  He  did  not  go,  but  soon  after  went  to  Baltimore  and  commenced  a  business  career 
that  made  him  both  famous  and  wealthy.150 

In  1853,  when  Hayward  was  twenty-one,  he  and  brothers  Jesse  and  Elias  left  New 
Hampshire  to  join  their  uncles,  George  and  Jonas  Hayward,  in  the  Bartlett  &  Hayward 
Company,  an  innovative  business  producing  stoves  that  they  had  started  in  1844  in 
Baltimore.  The  business  grew  to  become  one  of  Baltimore’s  largest  iron  manufacturers, 
shifting  its  focus  to  ornamental  iron  work,  steam  heating  and  “the  construction  of  com¬ 
plete  plants  for  making  illuminating  gas.  This  firm  furnished  the  heating  apparatus  for  the 


tune  in  the  fur  seal  business.”146

Johns  Hopkins  Hospital,  the  City  Hall  of  Baltimore;  also  those  in  the  Treasury,  State,  War, 
and  Navy  building;  Post  Office  and  new  Library  at  Washington. . . .  They  employ  from  800 
to  1,200  men  . . .  built  a  variety  of  tools  for  the  manufacture  of  guns.”151  One  may  conclude 
that  it  was  as  an  outgrowth  of  these  enterprises  that  Hayward  M.  Hutchinson  entered  into 
the  manufacture  and  selling  of  cooking  utensils  to  the  Union  Army  during  the  Civil  War. 
As  a  consequence,  Hayward  became  acquainted  with  General  Lovell  Harrison  Rousseau, 
the  military  commander  heading  Customs  and  Trade  during  the  Civil  War.  After  the  war, 
in  1867,  General  Rousseau  suggested  to  Hayward  that  he  accompany  the  general  to  Sitka 
in  Russian  America  (via  San  Francisco)  where,  as  the  presidentially  appointed  United 
States  Commissioner,  Rousseau  would  accept  the  territorial  transfer  from  the  Russian 
Governor  Prince  Maksutov.152  As  noted  in  Hayward  Hutchinson’s  1883  obituary: 

Mr.  Hutchinson  being  the  oldest  of  the  firm,  his  business  and  inclination  led  him  to  do 
much  traveling,  and  about  the  close  of  the  war,  at  which  time  he  was  in  rather  poor  health, 
he  made  a  trip  to  Alaska.  Here  he  became  acquainted  with  the  Russian  governor  of  that 
province,  and  seeing  an  opportunity,  formed  a  company  and  obtained  for  it  the  fur  seal 
business,  by  which  he  amassed  a  fortune.153 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Hayward  M.  Hutchinson  saw  more  than  one  “opportunity”  on  his  western  journey.  He 
made  good  contacts  in  San  Francisco  while  traveling  with  General  Rousseau.  At  New 
Archangel  (Sitka)  he  developed  more  contacts.  Hutchinson’s  business  acumen  enabled 
him  to  outmaneuver  potential  rivals,  such  as  Oppenheim  &  Co.  of  London,  England.154 
His  successful  acquisition  of  the  Russian-American  Company’s  (RAC)  major  assets  en¬ 
abled  him  to  establish  a  significant  competitive  foothold  in  the  territory.  With  the  RAC 
assets  in  hand,  he  formed  Hutchinson,  Kohl  8c  Company,  which  he  parlayed  into  the 
Alaska  Commercial  Company  (ACC).  Then  in  1871,  he  entered  into  a  lease  with  Russia, 
thereby  obtaining  sole  rights  to  the  Russian  northern  fur-seal  herd  at  the  Commander 
Islands.155  Hutchinson’s  bold  business  moves  succeeded  in  securing  ACC  monopolies 
over  the  northern  fur-seal  trade  in  the  United  States  and  Russia. 

The  ACC’s  successful  bid  for  the 
lease  to  the  Pribilof  Islands  fur-seal  har¬ 
vest  rankled  many  businessmen  with 
like  intentions.  Some  of  these  men,  such 
as  Louis  Goldstone,  who  represented 
numerous  other  interests,156  went  all-out 
to  discredit  the  ACC  in  futile  attempts 
to  obtain  their  own  direct  access  to  the 
fur-seal  wealth.  They  formed  the  Anti- 
Monopoly  Association  and  contributed 
to  the  creation  of  the  Alaska  Herald 
newspaper  in  San  Francisco  (1868-72) 
to  print  occasional,  spurious  articles 
about  the  ACC  (see  Honcharenko  biog¬ 
raphy).  These  efforts  succeeded  in  spur-

ring  Congress,  in  1876,  to  open  an  inquiry  into  the  performance  of  the  ACC  under  its 
lease  from  the  U.S.  government.157 

Hutchinson  first  testified  before  a  subcommittee  of  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives 
Ways  and  Means  Committee  in  Washington,  D.C.,  on  April  24,  1876,  and  then  again  on 
May  3.  Subcommittee  members  queried  Hutchinson  on  his  involvement  in  the  Alaska 
sealing  industry  and  the  circumstances  leading  to  the  government’s  twenty-year  lease  of 
the  Seal  Islands  to  the  ACC. 


In  his  April  24,  1876,  testimony,  Hutchinson  responded  to  numerous  questions  from 
Congressman  Hill.  His  responses  are  abridged  here: 


I  reside  in  Washington.  I  have  resided  here  since  December,  1868  ...  I  was  living  here 
during  the  time  of  the  lease  of  the  Alaska  Islands  to  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company.  I 
am  a  stockholder  in  the  company,  and  was  originally  an  officer,  first  elected  secretary  then 
treasurer.  The  Alaska  Commercial  Company  owned  nothing  except  the  lease  when  the 
lease  was  obtained,  but  afterward  all  the  business  of  my  company,  Hutchinson,  Kohl  & 

Co.,  was  sold  or  transferred  to  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company.  Mr.  Miller  was  the  first 
president  of  the  company  and  is  its  president  now,  but  many  changes  have  occurred  with 
the  directors.  The  company  employs  agents  for  the  discharge  of  its  business  in  Alaska.  The 
attorney  for  the  company  at  present  is  Mr.  Jefferies.  When  I  came  here  to  Washington, 
in  1868, 1  had  a  very  vague  idea  of  the  way  to  proceed  to  get  some  legislation  for  Alaska, 
and  I  looked  around  and  employed  a  gentleman  who  consented  to  be  an  attorney  for  the 
company.  That  was  Mr.  J.A.  Creswell.  I  went  to  Elkton  [Maryland]  to  see  him  on  the  subject 
in  December,  1868. 1  explained  my  business  and  proposition,  and  asked  his  advice  as  to  the 
drafting  of  the  bill.  I  asked  him  to  come  to  Washington  and  be  the  attorney  of  the  company. 
He  kept  that  position  until  his  appointment  as  Postmaster  General.  The  company  had  been 
organized  under  the  State  laws  of  California  in  the  fall  of  1868. 158 


WILLIAM  KOHL

Hutchinson  continued  his  testimony  in  re¬ 
sponse  to  questions  posed  by  Congressman 
Fernando  Wood,  Chairman  of  the  Subcommittee 
of  the  Ways  and  Means  Committee.  Hutchinson 
identified  the  men  involved  with  securing  the 
lease  and  those  employed  as  officers  of  the  ACC. 
He  stated  emphatically  that  no  wrongdoing  or 
undue  influence  entered  into  the  acquisition  of 
the  lease.  Again,  his  testimony  is  abridged  here. 

I  did  myself,  and  in  my  own  name,  purchase  the 
property  of  the  old  Russian-American  Company. 

I  went  to  Alaska  in  1867.  I  started  north  from 
Victoria,  with  a  small  vessel,  in  December,  1867, 
and  went  to  Sitka  with  the  full  intention  of  buying 
the  interest  of  the  Russian-American  Company, 
their  buildings,  boats,  and  paraphernalia  which 
were  not  transferred  to  the  United  States.  I  bought 
all  their  goods  and  chattels  at  Sitka  at  a  fixed  price 
per  yard,  per  pound,  per  dozen,  etc.,  according  to 
the  catalogue  which  they  had  of  the  goods  on  hand. 

I  bought  everything  they  had.  I  bought  everything 
in  my  own  name  except  one  vessel  [schooner 
H.M.  Hutchinsonl,  which  I  bought  in  the  name  of 
Hutchinson  &  Hirsch.  It  was  then  the  conception 


338 


Biographies  H  ♦  Hutchinson 


of  having  the  lease  given  to  me  arose.  I  do  not  think  I  thought  of  it  until  I  went  north  [in 
1868]  and  saw  the  condition  of  things  on  the  islands;  this  great  seal-life,  and  its  importance 
to  the  people  of  this  country  and  of  Alaska.  I  never  dreamed  of  such  a  thing  as  having  any 
privilege  or  that  there  was  any  necessity  for  it.  But  after  living  there  one  season,  and  seeing 
the  danger  of  the  destruction  of  the  seal-fisheries,  I  then  wanted  the  privilege  perpetuated, 
so  as  to  get  my  money  out  of  the  business.159 

According  to  Gustave  Niebaum,  Hayward  Hutchinson  first  visited  the  Pribilofs 
aboard  the  newly  acquired  schooner  H.M.  Hutchinson.  It  “landed  at  St.  Paul  Island's 
Northeast  Point  in  1868  following  the  transfer  of  property  to  the  United  States.  Hayward 
Hutchinson  and  the  crew  landed  in  great  style  and  carried  an  American  flag  to  the  high¬ 
est  hill  claiming  the  island  as  an  American  island.”  That  high  hill  at  Northeast  Point  bears 
the  name  Hutchinson  Hill.160 

After  his  arch-competitor,  Louis  Goldstone,  testified,  Hutchinson  went  before 
the  committee  again,  on  May  3,  1876,  and  responded  (A)  to  questions  (Q)  posed  by 
Congressman  Hill: 

Hill  (Q):  Hutchinson,  Kohl  &  Co.,  as  1  understand,  took  from  Saint  Paul  and  Saint  George’s 
Islands  some  eighty-odd  thousand  seal-skins  previous  to  this  lease  in  1869.  They  paid  the 
Government  a  royalty  of  $1.00  per  skin,  did  they  not? 

Hutchinson  (A):  Yes,  Sir. 

Hill  (Q):  Who  owned  those  80,000  skins? 

Hutchinson  (A):  I  would  like  to  state  that  we  did  not  take  these  skins  from  the  island 
until  after  the  law  was  passed.  We  killed  the  seals  in  1869,  but  the  skins  were  not  taken 
away  until  1870,  after  the  lease  had  been  awarded  to  us.  I  believe  Mr.  Boutwell  [Treasury 
Secretary]  recommended  to  some  members  of  the  committee  that  those  skins  then  on  the 
island,  which  had  already  been  taken  in  1869,  be  taxed  $1.00,  and  that  was  put  into  the  law; 
we  were  taxed  a  dollar  apiece  for  them.  Those  skins  belonged  to  Hutchinson,  Kohl  &  Co., 
and  Williams,  Haven  &  Co.  of  New  London,  Conn. 

Hill  (Q):  Who  are  Williams,  Haven  &  Co.? 

Hutchinson  (A):  Williams,  Haven  &  Co  are  Mr.  Henry  P.  Haven,  of  Connecticut,  who  died 
last  Sunday,  and  Richard  Chapel.  They  are  whalers.  They  took  seals  and  whales,  and  had 
been  at  that  business  in  the  Pacific  for  a  great  many  years.  They  had  a  vessel  in  the  water  of 
the  Okhotsk  Sea,  I  think,  seal-fishing  in  1866.  While  their  vessel  was  at  Honolulu  in  1866, 
the  captain  became  acquainted  with  a  Russian  captain  who  put  in  there  in  distress  with 
the  remainder,  or  a  portion,  of  the  Alaska  seal-skins  taken  by  the  old  Russian  company 
and  there  this  captain  learned  of  this  interest.  He  left  his  vessel  at  Honolulu,  went  to 
Connecticut,  and  conferred  with  his  employers.  Then  Mr.  Chapel,  one  of  the  concerns, 
went  out  to  Honolulu  and  fitted  out  this  vessel  and  another  one  and  sent  them  to  the 
Alaska  Islands  as  early  as  April,  1868. 

When  we  arrived  on  the  island  we  found  three  men  had  been  landed  there  by  a  small 
vessel,  and  the  other  large  vessel  was  lying  off  the  island  ready  to  land  whenever  the  wind 
and  the  ice  would  allow.  They  sealed  on  their  own  account  during  1868. 1  was  there  on 
the  island  at  the  time.  When  I  went  there  I  found  a  great  deal  of  wrangling  and  quarreling 
between  the  two  interests  of  Hutchinson,  Kohl  &  Co.,  and  Captain  Morgan,  of  the 
Connecticut  people.  One  of  our  vessels,  a  steamer,  had  landed  before  me  with  Mr.  Bosquet, 
who  also  was  interested,  with  instructions  to  go  to  sealing;  but  he  and  Captain  Morgan 
had  a  great  deal  of  trouble  and  annoyance.  I  tried  to  arrange  to  seal  together,  but  Captain 
Morgan  was  not  at  all  inclined  to  make  any  arrangement.  We  had  working  for  us  all  of  the 
inhabitants  of  Saint  Paul  Island,  numbering  about  90  men.  Captain  Morgan  had  the  people 
that  he  brought  with  him  from  Honolulu  to  seal.  Williams,  Haven  &  Co.  did  their  business 


339 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


on  the  Pacific  coast,  and  the  management  of  it  was  by  a  younger  Mr.  Williams  in  Honolulu. 
The  quarreling  became  almost  serious.  They  commenced  sealing  much  earlier  that  season 
than  the  Russians  had  sealed  before.  When  I  came  there,  about  the  9th  May,  1868, 1  found 
this  wrangling  going  on,  and  my  people  very  much  inclined  to  drive  away  the  others;  that 
is,  to  have  a  quarrel  with  them.  They  had  about  24  men  to  our  90. 1  went  to  see  Mr.  Morgan 
at  his  quarters.  We  talked  it  over  a  long  time  and  tried  to  have  some  arrangement  that  we 
might  seal  according  to  the  old  rules  of  the  Russian  company,  of  which  I  had  learned  a  great 
deal  in  my  journey  to  San  Francisco  with  the  Russian  commissioner.  My  four  month  stay 
in  Sitka  also  gave  me  information  as  to  the  manner  of  doing  business.  When  I  came  to  the 
island  1  found  that  the  natives  were  very  tenacious  about  the  manner  of  killing,  and  did  not 
want  the  seals  killed  excepting  by  the  old  rules  of  the  company,  which  had  preserved  these 
animals  for  so  many  years.  Morgan’s  men  killed  old  seals,  cows,  or  anything  they  came 
across.  The  idea  was  to  get  all  they  could.  We  failed  to  make  any  arrangement,  but  agreed 
to  work  at  separate  points.  There  are  six  or  seven  different  rookeries  from  which  seals  are 
driven  to  be  killed.  We  divided  the  rookeries.  The  Morgan  party  drove  from  two  or  three, 
while  we  drove  from  the  others,  so  that  there  was  no  conflict  in  regard  to  the  territory  to 
drive  from.  The  business  closed  up  in  1868  with  their  taking  what  they  could  with  their 
twenty-four  people,  and  we  taking  what  we  could  with  our  ninety  people.  I  then  came  to 
Washington,  seeing  that  this  business  would  be  destroyed  unless  there  was  something 
done,  and  came  with  a  very  indefinite  idea  what  to  ask,  and  in  fact  not  prepared  to  ask  for 
anything  except  some  legislation  looking  to  the  preservation  of  these  animals.  My  visit  here 
finally  resulted  in  legislation. 

Early  in  1869,  while  I  was  here  in  that  regard,  these  people  came  down  from  Connecticut 
and  made  an  offer  of  a  dollar  a  skin  to  the  Committee  on  Commerce.  Williams,  Haven  & 

Co.  were  two-fifths  owners,  and  Hutchinson,  Kohl  &  Co.  three-fifths  owners  of  the  87,000 
skins  taken  in  1869. 161 

Hill  (Q):  What  interest  had  Ennis,  Parrott  &  Wasserman  in  that  case? 

Hutchinson  (A):  None. 

Hill  (Q):  And  you  say  that  Taylor  &  Bendell  had  no  interest?” 

Hutchinson  (A):  None. 

Hill  (Q):  They  brought  suit  however  for  an  interest? 

Hutchinson  (A):  Yes,  sir;  they  brought  suit  in  1871  for  the  cash  for  that  portion  of  the  skins 
taken  from  Saint  George  Island,  to  wit,  24,000.  That  was  under  an  old  arrangement  with 
Burgam  &  Co.  In  that  1868  matter  that  I  spoke  of,  Taylor  &  Bendell  landed  a  schooner  at 
Saint  George  Island,  and  another  party  (with  whom,  I  think,  Mr.  Parrott  and  a  gentleman 
named  House,  from  Boston,  had  an  interest)  landed  another  schooner,  so  that  when  our 
people  returned  the  second  time  to  Saint  George  Island,  they  found  these  two  schooners 
there  with  their  people  ashore  putting  up  a  small  building,  adobe  mostly,  and  preparing 
to  seal.  Our  people  went  into  an  arrangement  to  work  Saint  George  Island  together,  they 
having  a  portion  and  our  people  having  a  portion.  [See  Osborne  Howes  biography  for 
additional  insight  into  Parrott  &  Co.  involvement.]  In  March  1869  I  think,  Congress  passed 
a  resolution  making  those  islands  a  Government  reservation,  and  allowing  the  Secretary  of 
the  Treasury  to  designate  who  might  remain  on  the  island,  or  go  there.  We  got  permission, 

I  think  from  Secretary  McCulloch,  to  go  on  this  island  and  kill  as  ma/iy  seals  were 
necessary  for  the  support  of  the  people.  Then  we  killed  those  69,000;  24,000  from  Saint 
George  and  the  remainder  from  Saint  Paul.162  After,  Taylor  &  Bendell  claimed  an  interest  in 
these  24,000,  and  brought  suit  against  us  for  their  interest  in  them.  We  notified  them  before 
we  went  north  in  1869,  that  that  arrangement  ceased  between  the  two  concerns.163 

The  Ways  and  Means  Committee  resolved: 

That  in  the  opinion  of  this  House  there  is  no  just  ground  of  complaint  against  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company  or  the  officers  of  the  Government  who  were  intrusted  under  the  law

Igadagax 

Aleutian  Islands  Hunter  and  Explorer 
Genealogy 

Igadagax  was  the  son  of  Unimak  Island  Toion  Akkagnikax,  born  sometime  before  1786. 
Discovery  of  the  Seal  (Pribilof)  Islands 

Traditional  Unangan  (Aleut)  folklore  recounts  the  discovery  of  the  Tanax-Amix 1  or  Seal 
Islands  by  Igadagax,2  the  son  of  an  Unangan  toion  (chief)  on  Unimak  Island.3  The  first 
written  record  of  this  intriguing  story  is  in  Ivan  Veniaminov’s  1840  publication  Zapiski 
ob  ostrovakh  Unalashkinskago  otdeyla,  which  has  been  translated  in  whole  or  part  by 
several  linguists.  The  version  these  authors  relied  upon  was  translated  by  Dr.  Lydia  T. 
Black  and  Richard  H.  Geoghegan  and  published  by  Limestone  Press  in  1984.4  Artist  and 
fur-seal  naturalist  and  advo¬ 
cate  Henry  Wood  Elliott  may 
have  been  the  first  to  publish 
Veniaminov’s  tale  in  English,5 
and  Waldemar  Jochelson  the 
second  person.  Elliott’s  trans¬ 
lation  differs  markedly  from 
Jochelson’s,  and  only  in  some 
details  from  Dr.  Lydia  Black’s 
given  below,  but  the  general 
concepts  are  clear  from  all.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


while  traveling  around  in  his  baidarka  [iqyax],  had  been  carried  away  from  shore  by  a  storm 
coming  up  from  the  southeast.  It  being  impossible  for  him  to  approach  his  home  shore 
or  any  neighboring  place,  he  had  been  forced  to  commit  himself  to  the  mercy  of  the  wind 
and  had,  so  it  seems,  after  three  or  four  days,  been  carried  to  the  island  of  [St.  Paul],  the 
northernmost  of  the  Pribilovs.  Here  he  remained  until  spring,  hunting  various  animals.  In 
the  spring,  during  clear  weather,  he  saw  the  peaks  of  Unimak  and  decided  to  put  to  sea  and, 
after  a  voyage  of  three  or  four  days,  safely  reached  his  native  Unimak,  bringing  with  him 
many  sea  otter  tails  and  rnordki  [the  larger  part  of  the  sea  otter  skin,  possibly  with  snouts]. 
They  [Aleut  storytellers]  point  out  on  St.  Paul  Island  a  spot  where  his  yurta  is  supposed 
to  have  been.  I  find  nothing  improbable  or  impossible  in  this  narrative  because,  by  the 
testimony  of  inhabitants  of  St.  Paul,  the  peaks  of  Unimak  are  visible  in  clear  weather  in  the 
spring  time,  and  Mr.  Sarychev  has  heard  the  word  Ami: t,  in  an  ancient  song,  which  [the 
Aleuts]  either  were  unable  or  unwilling  to  explain,  and  which  is  the  ancient  name  of  the 
Pribvlov  Islands.1 2 3 4 5 6 


1  The  Unangan  words  Tanax-Amix,  for  the  islands  discovered  by  IgadagaX,  are  spelled  variously  in  the 
literature,  see  Waldemar  Jochelson,  History,  Ethnology  and  Anthropology  of  the  Aleut  (Washington, 
DC:  Carnegie  Institute,  1933),  76;  and  Knut  Bergsland,  Aleut  Dictionary  (Fairbanks:  Univ.  of  Alaska, 
Alaska  Native  Language  Center,  1994),  66.  Translations  for  these  words  include  “The  Land-Uncle”  or 
“The  Island-Uncle”  by  Jochelson,  History,  Ethnology  and  Anthropology,  76,  and  William  S.  Laughlin, 
Aleuts:  Survivors  of  the  Bering  Land  Bridge  (NY:  Holt,  Reinhart,  Winston,  1980),  12;  they  have  also 
been  translated  as  “Mother’s  Brother.” 

2  The  spelling  and  phonetic  distinctions  of  “Igadagax?’  vary  among  transliterators;  this  spelling 
is  taken  from  Knut  Bergsland,  Ancient  Aleut  Personal  Names  =  Kadaangim  Asangin/Asangis: 
Materials  from  the  Billings  Expedition,  1790-1792  (Fairbanks:  Univ.  of  Alaska,  Alaska  Native 
Language  Center,  1998),  200.  The  spelling  “Igadagax" comes  from  Jochelson’s  History,  Ethnology  and 
Anthropology,  77.  Ivan  Veniaminov  s  Notes  on  the  Islands  of  the  Unalashka  District  [ Zapiski  ob  ostro- 
vakh  Unalashkinskago  otdeyla ],  ed.  Richard  A.  Pierce,  trans.  Lydia  T.  Black  and  R.  H.  Geoghegan 
(Kingston,  ON:  Limestone  Press,  1984),  134,  apparently  relied  on  Henry  Wood  Elliott,  A  Report 
Upon  the  Conditions  of  Affairs  in  the  Territory  of  Alaska  (Washington:  GPO,  1875),  241,  who  also 
performed  a  transliteration  of  Veniaminov’s  text  using  the  phonetic  spelling,  Eegad-dahgeek.  The 
authors  are  aware  that  other  spellings  are  also  employed. 

3  Anthropologist  William  S.  Laughlin  stated  that  an  Aleut  named  “Ivory  Smasher”  was  “one  of  the 
Aleut  heroes  who  landed”  at  St.  Paul  Island  before  the  arrival  of  the  Russians.  These  authors  did 
not  learn  of  any  other  “heroes,”  so  it  is  unclear  whether  Laughlin  was  referring  to  Igadagax  as 
Ivory  Smasher  or  someone  else  ( Aleuts :  Survivors  of  the  Bering  Land  Bridge,  12  and  113).  Laughlin 
also  stated  that  Ivory  Smasher  came  from  the  island  of  Tigalda,  rather  than  Unimak  as  stated  by 
Veniaminov,  Notes  on  the  Islands,  134,  suggesting  that  he  is  not  the  same  individual  as  Igadagax 
{Aleuts:  Survivors,  113). 

4  Veniaminov,  Notes  on  the  Islands,  134-5. 

5  Henry  Wood  Elliott,  A  Report  Upon  the  Conditions  of  Affairs,  241. 

6  The  translation  given  here  of  Veniaminov,  Notes  on  the  Islands  District,  134-5,  was  interpreted 
by  Dr.  Lydia  Black  based  in  part  on  an  earlier  translation  by  Richard  Geoghegan  (unpublished);  a 
comparison  of  the  two  serves  to  enlighten  the  lay  reader,  not  to  assume  that  any  translation  neces¬ 
sarily  represents  the  exact  written  meaning  of  the  original  author.  Knut  Bergsland,  Ancient  Aleut 
Personal  Names,  200,  suggested  “lgadagaxu  could  mean  “monster  kind  of  scarecrow,”  or  “starfish”  in 
the  eastern  Aleut  dialect.  Knut  Bergsland ,  Aleut  Dictionary,  704,  provided  the  Aleut  word  “Iqyax:” 
for  the  baidarka  or  kayak.

Genealogy 

Sheldon  Jackson  was  born  on  May  18,  1834,  at 
Minaville,  New  York,  to  Samuel  Clinton  Jackson 
and  Delia  (Sheldon)  Jackson.  Sheldon  Jackson 
died  in  Alaska  on  May  2,  1909. 1 

Biographical  Sketch 

Sheldon  Jackson  graduated  in  1855  from  Union 
College  at  Schenectady,  New  York,  and  in  1858 
from  Princeton  Theological  Seminary,  Princeton, 

New  Jersey.  He  served  as  a  missionary  at  Indian

In  1885,  he  became  U.S.  General  Agent  of 
Education  for  Alaska.  Besides  his  work  to  intro¬ 
duce  the  reindeer  as  an  additional  food  source  for 
Alaska  Natives,  Jackson  established  missions  at 
Fort  Wrangell,  Sitka,  and  Point  Barrow.  Historic

and  1900.  The  Sheldon  Jackson  Papers  are  housed  at  the  Presbyterian  Historical  Society 
in  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania.2 

Jackson  prefaced  his  1895  explanation  for  bringing  reindeer  to  Alaska  with  observa¬ 
tions  about  the  plight  of  other  mammals  that  had  been  decimated  by  commerce  in  the 
Bering  Sea  and  Arctic  Ocean: 

As  the  great  herds  of  buffalo  that  once  roamed  the  Western  prairies  have  been 
exterminated  for  their  pelts,  so  the  whales  have  been  sacrificed  for  the  fat  that  incased  their 
bodies  and  the  bone  that  hung  in  their  mouths  [baleen].  With  the  destruction  of  the  whale 
one  large  source  of  food  supply  for  the  natives  has  been  cut  off. 

Another  large  supply  was  derived  from  the  walrus,  which  once  swarmed  in  great  numbers 
in  those  northern  seas.  But  commerce  wanted  more  ivory,  and  the  whalers  turned  their 
attention  to  the  walrus,  destroying  thousands  annually  for  the  sake  of  their  tusks. . . .  The 
walrus,  as  a  source  of  food  supply,  is  already  very  scarce. 

The  sea  lions,  once  so  common  in  Bering  Sea,  are  now  becoming  so  few  in  number  that  it  is 
with  difficulty  that  the  natives  procure  a  sufficient  number  of  skins  to  cover  their  boats. . . . 

In  the  past  the  natives,  with  tireless  industry,  caught  and  cured,  for  use  in  their  long 
winters,  great  quantities  of  fish,  but  American  canneries  have  already  come  to  some  of  their 
streams,  and  will  soon  be  found  on  all  of  them,  both  carrying  the  food  out  of  the  country, 
and  by  their  wasteful  methods,  destroying  the  future  supply. . . .  [A]nd  the  business  still  in 
its  infancy — means  starvation  to  the  native  races  in  the  near  future.3 

With  those  and  other  dire  observations,  Sheldon  Jackson,  United  States  General 
Agent  of  Education  in  Alaska,  justified  the  introduction  of  reindeer,  a  domesticated  cari¬ 
bou,  to  Alaska  for  Native  subsistence. 

In  1891,  Jackson  journeyed  to  Siberia  aboard  the  Revenue  Cutter  Bear  to  determine 
whether  reindeer  could  be  purchased  from  Natives  in  Siberia  and  then  be  transported 
alive.  Private  donations  ($2,146)  helped  cover  the  cost  of  the  venture  after  Congress  had 
declined  to  allocate  the  requested  funds  ($15,000).  The  Siberian  Natives,  “knowing  noth¬ 
ing  of  the  use  of  money,”  accepted  trade  goods  as  barter  for  sixteen  reindeer.  With  the 
help  of  Captain  Michael  Healy  of  the  Bear,  he  transported  the  animals  to  Alaska.  Despite 
severe  Arctic  weather,  the  reindeer  survived  aboard  ship  for  some  three  weeks.  The  crew 
of  the  Bear  finally  landed  them  in  good  condition  at  Amaknak  Island,  in  the  harbor  of 
Unalaska.4 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

With  Dr.  Samuel  Call,  Sheldon  Jackson  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  on  June  1,  1892,  aboard 
the  Bear,  with  Captain  Michael  Healy  again  in  command.  The  men  spent  the  day  evalu¬ 
ating  environmental  conditions  on  the  island  and  the  potential  need  by  the  Natives  for 
domestic  reindeer  as  a  supplementary  source  of  subsistence.5  However,  it  was  not  until 
1911,  with  a  push  by  Alaskan  Fur-Seal  Service  Assistant  Agent  Ezra  W.  Clark,  that  rein¬ 
deer  were  introduced  to  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  islands  (see  Ezra  Westcote  Clark  II  biog¬ 
raphy).

Anthropologist 

Genealogy 

Waldemar  Jochelson  (Vladimir  Il’ich  Iokhel’son)  was  born  in  Vilna  (aka  Vilnius), 
Lithuania.6 

Biographical  Sketch 

Waldemar  Jochelson  became  an  anarchist  within  the  revolutionary  and  terrorist  organi¬ 
zation  Peoples  Will  ( Narodnaya  Volya)  while  a  university  student  in  Vilnius,  Lithuania. 
Eventually,  the  state  arrested  him  for  his  activities  and  sentenced  him  to  three  years  of 
solitary  confinement  and  ten  years  of  exile  in  northeastern  Siberia.  In  Siberia,  he  and 
fellow  revolutionaries  became  interested  in  the  ethnology  and  orthography  of  Siberian 
Natives.  His  publications  resulting  from  this  area  of  intense  interest  led  to  a  leadership 
role  on  a  Russian  Geographical  Society-sponsored  expedition.  That  expedition’s  success 
led  in  turn  to  others,  including  the  Aleut-Kamchatka  Expedition,  also  sponsored  by  the 
Russian  Geographical  Society.  The  Aleut-Kamchatka  Expedition  took  Jochelson  to  the 
Aleutians  and  Pribilof  Islands.  According  to  Unangam  Tunuu  linguists  Knut  Bergsland 
and  Moses  Dirks  (Jochelson,  Aleut  Tales  and  Narratives,  7),  Jochelson  engaged  “talented 
assistants,  managed  to  find  the  few  surviving  storytellers  of  the  time,  and  so  rescued  from 
oblivion  a  large  body  of  Aleut  traditions.” 


Waldemar  Jochelson  sits  atop 
stepladder  with  a  young  woman 
(niece  Lidia  Domherr?)  lean- 
ing  against  him.  Wife  Dina 
Lazareona  Jochelson  is  seated

Jochelson  himself  published  only  a  very  small  part  of  his  material,  in  1923,  and  the  corpus 
published  in  the  present  edition  [Aleut  Tales  and  Narratives \  is  no  longer  complete,  but 
still  it  is  a  copious  and  irreplaceable  source  of  Aleut  lore. 

Today  . . .  very  little  is  left  of  the  original  Aleut  storytelling  tradition  (apart  from  fairy  tales 
and  other  stories  borrowed  from  the  Russians).  The  Jochelson  collection  constitutes  nearly 
all  that  remains  of  this  heritage  and  thus  is  of  great  importance,  not  only  to  specialists 
and  to  the  general  public  interested  in  such  matters,  but  also,  not  the  least,  to  the  Aleuts 
themselves  as  part  of  their  cultural  identity.7 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Agent  Walter  Lembkey  entered  comments  into  the  Agent’s  Log  about  Jochelson’s  visit  to 
St.  Paul  Island  in  1910: 

Dr.  Jochelson  has  been  making  ethnological  studies  of  the  natives  of  the  Aleutian  Islands, 

Kodiak  and  the  littoral  of  Bering  Sea  and  came  here  for  the  purpose  of  continuing  his 
investigations  here.  He  works  under  the  auspices  of  the  Royal  Geographic  Society  of 
Russia.8 

And  from  Lembkey ’s  Log  on  July  19,  1910: 

Shortly  after  the  [U.S.  Revenue  Cutter]  MANNING  left  her  anchorage,  a  strange  large 
steamer  was  sighted. ...  As  the  fog  shut  in,  we  could  make  out  the  MANNING  steaming 
toward  her  at  full  speed.  Later  the  fog  lifted  and  disclosed  the  MANNING  lying  by  the 
steamer.  The  latter  was  soon  seen  to  be  flying  the  Russian  flag. . . .  The  MANNING  then 
left  her,  and  the  [U.S.  Revenue  Cutter]  PERRY  which  had  come  from  North  East  Point . . . 
anchored  off  the  flagstaff  well  inside  the  stranger.

About  5  p.m.  a  boat  from  the  latter  came  ashore.  From  Lieutenant  Schildknecht,  in  charge 
of  the  boat,  it  was  learned  that  the  strange  vessel  was  the  transport  KOLIMA  of  the  Russian 
Imperial  Navy,  from  Petropavlovsk  . . .  and  that  its  object  in  calling  here  was  to  take  aboard 
Professor  Jochelson,  and  to  transport  him,  his  wife  and  his  collection  to  Kamschatka  [sic]. 

The  same  log  reported  that  the  Jochelsons  boarded  the  Kolima  for  Unalaska  and  then 
Petropavlovsk. 

[ochelson  recorded  a  version  of  the  Aleut  tale  of  discovery  of  Tanax  Amix  from  Isidor 
Solovyov  at  Unalaska  in  1909.  Here  it  is  in  translation  by  Knut  Bergsland  and  Moses 
Dirks.9  (See  Igadagax  biography  for  Ivan  Veniaminov’s  version  as  translated  by  Dr.  Lydia 
Black.) 


Tanax- Amix* 

1  ChagnachXilaX  went  out  of  his  house,  got  up  on  top  of  his  house  and  began  to  make 
observations.  Recalling  what  had  happened  on  TanaX-AmiX,  he  became  violent.  3While  he 
was  meditating,  SiluX-AliglaX  came  out  to  him.  4“My  beloved  cousin,  you  could  still  tell  us 
about  what  happened  on  TanaX-AmiX,  but  you  are  apparently  still  not  going  to  do  it?” 

5"One  like  you  should  not  say  it  like  that,  fool.” 

gLetting  his  two  bumblebees  out  of  his  nose  at  him,  letting  his  two  blowflies  out  of  his  eyes 
at  him,b  letting  his  eyes  down  along  the  ridge  of  his  nose,c  performing  as  a  demon  before 
him,  he  made  him  step  back  from  him  so  that  he  fell  into  his  house. 

7Then  he  got  into  his  killer  whale  [form]  and  went  to  sea.  gWhile  he  was  traveling  under 
the  water,  he  killed  an  animal,  a  sea  lion  bull  which  had  none  older  than  itself,  and  took  it 
ashore.  gPutting  it  in  the  crook  of  his  arms,  he  ascended  Makushin  Volcano  with  it.  1QHe 
put  it  down  between  two  hillsd  of  this  plain.c  1  ]Then  he  came  down  and  spent  the  night  in 
his  house. 

1 2The  next  morning,  when  daylight  came,  he  again  got  up  on  top  of  his  house.  1 3While  he 
was  there,  his  cousin  Silux-Aliglax  again  came  out  to  him.  14He  said  to  his  cousin,  1 5“Well, 
stop  being  like  that  and  take  us  to  TanaX-AmiX” 

1  g“That’s  how  you  kept  saying  it  yesterday,  fool!”  he  said  and  began  to  let  his  two 
bumblebees  appear  out  of  his  nose  at  him.  17He  began  to  let  his  two  blowflies  appear  out 
of  his  eyes  at  him.  1  gHe  took  off  his  parka.  1  gHe  let  his  eyes  down  along  the  ridge  of  his 
nose  at  him.  20Tucking  up  his  sleeves  before  him,  he  began  to  perform  as  a  demon  for  him. 

2  ^  Making  him  step  back  from  him,  he  had  him  enter  into  his  house. 

22After  that  he  put  on  his  largest  killer  whale  [skin]  as  a  guise  and  stepped  into  the  sea. 
23He  killed  the  largest  whale.  24Heading  ashore  with  it,  after  he  got  up  on  land  with  it, 
putting  it  in  the  crook  of  his  arms,  he  ascended  with  it  again.  25Taking  it  over  the  plain/  he 
put  it  down  between  the  two  hills  of  the  plain.  26Thinking  that  he  was  strong,  he  rejoiced. 
27And  so  he  reached  his  house  and  spent  the  night  again. 

2gThe  next  morning  when  daylight  came,  he  got  up  on  top  of  his  house  and  began  to  make 
observations  again.  2gHis  cousin  went  out  to  him  and  said  to  him,  30“That’s  what  you  could 
do,  that’s  what  you  could  say,  so  get  ready,”  he  said  and  turned  to  him,  but  he  turned  just  to 
where  he  had  been.6  31  Being  so  many,  he  made  for  himself1  only  the  forepart  of  a  tent1  and 
spent  the  night. 

32The  next  morning  he  got  into  his  killer  whale  [form]  and  stepped  into  the  sea  along  with 
his  war  party.  33He  said  to  his  war  party,  34“Not  [along]  the  bottom  of  the  sea,  not  [along] 
the  surface  of  the  sea,  travel  only  by  way  of  the  subsurface  of  the  sea!”  34bAnd  all  of  them 
got  into  their  killer  whale  [forms]  and  set  out.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


35When  they  had  traveled  like  that  for  a  while,  they  began  to  surface  to  breathe.  3gThey 
saw  that  Unalaska  Island  had  become  very  low  [as  seen  from  there]  where  they  surfaced. 
37While  they  were  thus  breathing,  the  chief  of  the  war  party  again  said  to  them,  3g“Not 
[along]  the  bottom  of  the  sea,  not  [along]  the  surface  of  the  sea,  travel  only  by  way  of  the 
subsurface  of  the  sea!” 

39Getting  into  their  killer  whale  [forms]  they  traveled  on.  4QAfter  a  while  they  again  began 
to  surface  to  breathe.  41  They  saw  that  Tanax-Amix  was  lying  there  like  a  seat  pad1  floating 
on  the  sea. 

42And  so  one  by  one  they  began  getting  into  their  baidarkas.  43And  Chagnachxilax  put 
on  a  gut  parka  which  the  gut  of  a  humpback  whale  that  had  none  older  than  itself  was 
not  enough  to  make,  and  which  was  pieced  out  with  its  throat-folds.  44He  let  his  two 
bumblebees  out  of  his  eyes  one  after  another.  45He  let  his  two  blowflies  out  of  his  nose 
one  after  another.  4gHe  let  his  eyes  down  along  the  ridge  of  his  nose.  4/Loading  in  six  fur 
seals,  he  paddled  along  with  his  war  party.  4gHaving  paddled  close  to  land,  he  stopped  with 
his  war  party.  49“Over  there  one  could  not  get,  also  over  there  one  could  not  get.  5QFrom 
where  you  are  do  not  move  a  bit  farther.  51  If  I  am  permitted  to  get  ashore  safely,  I  will  make 
a  signal  over  my  head  to  you  like  this.” 

51  He  paddled  away  from  his  war  party.  52Having  paddled  for  a  while,  he  landed  on  the 
beach  below  the  village.  53His  nephew  Akaagniqax  came  down  to  the  beach  to  him. 

54“After  he  discovered  and  reached  this  island  Tanax-Amix,  baidarkas  began  to  paddle  to 
stir  its  waters  not  long  ago.” 

55“Yes,  your  father  Igadagax  used  to  tell  me  that  when  one  tried  to  discover  and  did 
discover  this  island  Tanax-Amix,  he  became  envious  for  itk  and  came  here.” 

5gWhen  he  got  out  of  his  baidarka  and  stepped  on  a  rock,  he  cracked  it.  57“Put  my  baidarka 
farther  up  on  the  beach  for  me  to  a  place  where  it  will  decay,  you  fool!” 

sgAnd  he  ordered  his  nephew  to  pick  up  his  baidarka  [and  carry  it]  on  his  right-hand  side. 
59And  he  picked  up  the  baidarka  and  started  to  walk  with  it.  g0He  went  up  the  beach  with 
it  until  he  (the  uncle)  saw  that  he  tore  on  it  (the  boat),  one  after  another,  the  six  fur  seals  he 
had  as  a  bracelet.1  g1“Is  that  all  right?”  he  said  to  his  uncle. 

62"I  told  you  to  put  it  farther  up,  didn’t  I,  you  fool!” 

63He  saw  that  his  fingers  were  stretched."1  g4Without  tearing  off  a  single  blade  of  grass,  he 
fell  face-down  onto  the  baidarka. 

65 Chagnachxilax  stepped  over  to  his  baidarka  and  took  out  the  waterbag  made  of  the 
urinary  bladder  of  a  humpback  whale,  emptied  the  water  out  of  it,  wrung  it  out,  and  gave 
it  to  his  nephew  Akaagniqax  saying,  66“Bring  back  to  me  in  it  only  the  life  water  of  your 
father  Igadagax,  do  not  bring  back  to  me  in  it  water  for  killing,  you  fool!” 

67When  the  water  was  brought  down  to  him,  he  poured  it  out  and  said,  g8“Do  not  bring  me 
again  water  for  killing,  fool,  but  bring  me  in  it  only  your  father’s  life  water.” 

69When  the  life  water  was  brought  to  him,  he  began  to  wash  himself  with  it.  7QAfter 
washing  himself,  he  put  his  sleeve  upright."  71  The  baidarkas  began  to  land,  and  after 
jumping  out,  they  all  took  their  baidarkas  up  on  the  beach. 

72lgadagax! s  son  Akaagniqax  went  up  and  said  to  his  father,  73“Strong  demons  have  landed, 
and  my  strength  you  made  so  that  it  wouldn’t  give  out  has  given  out,  so  do  not  do  what  you 
usually  do,  do  not  carry  on  a  frightful  thing,  a  demon-war.  74But,  woman  dwarf,"  arrange 
rather  a  feast  for  me.” 

75“They  are  people  from  the  mainland,11  they  have  fine  things,  although  they  are  not  that 
numerous, q  being  killed,  being  appropriated,  their  belongings  may  be  appropriated.”

76“Do  not  even  call  on  me!” 

77When  the  baidarkas  had  all  landed,  the  wife  of  a  bull  fur  seal  came  down.  78He  saw  her 
jump  on  the  baidarkas,  bite  off  all  the  spears  on  them/  and  come  at  him.  7gWhen  she  was 
about  to  jump  onto  his  baidarka,  he  made  her  fall  in  the  crook  of  his  arms  and  said  to  her, 
80“Tell  your  father  that  I  tell  you  to  tell  him  that  I  want  to  feel  the  wound  of  the  teeth  of  a 
beast  like  myself,  of  a  demon  like  myself.”5  81  She  went  up.  82ChagnachxilaX  saw  Igadagax 
bring  down  his  treat,  freshly  boiled  meat. 

Jochelson’s  explanatory  note: 

From  the  history  of  the  Russian  travels  in  the  Pacific  Ocean  we  know  that  the  Pribilov 
Islands  were  uninhabited  at  the  time  of  their  discovery.  They  were  discovered  by  Gerasim 
Pribilov,  whose  name  was  given  to  the  islands,  in  1786.  From  the  contents  of  this  heroic 
narration  one  may  draw  the  conclusion  that  the  Pribilovs  were  discovered  and  visited,  or 
even  inhabited,  by  Aleut  before  the  Russians,  if  not  in  very  old  times.  Of  course,  we  do  not 
know  how  far  this  tradition  may  be  regarded  as  historical  material.  By  the  name  Tanax- 
Amix  (Land  Uncle)'  in  some  texts  are  called  the  islands  St.  Paul  and  St.  George,  while  in 
others  St.  Paul  only  is  called  by  this  name.  I  give  here  only  a  part  of  the  narration,  told  in 
Unalaska  by  the  blind  Aleut  Solovyov,  as  far  as  it  was  translated  by  me  into  Russian  with 
the  assistance  of  my  Aleut  interpreters,  and  I  am  sorry  to  say  that  the  remainder  two  thirds 
of  the  text  I  am  not  able  now  to  translate.  The  language  of  the  text  is  very  far  from  the 
present  spoken  dialects  of  the  Aleut  language,  with  which  I  am  familiar." 

Jochelson’s  footnotes: 

a.  Jochelson’s  note:  “This  is  the  old  name  for  the  Pribilof  Islands  and  means  ‘Land-Uncle.’ 
Thus  also  was  called  St.  Paul  Island.”  The  name,  however,  is  a  stem  in  -g-,  see  sentence  2, 
whereas  ami-x  ‘maternal  uncle’  is  a  vowel  stem.  Cf.  (h)am/g-‘vicinity,  country’.

Numerous  interpretations  of  the  discovery  by  Igadagax  of  Tanax-Amix  have  been  re¬ 
ported,  and  each  is  clearly  based  upon  a  common  theme,  but  each  is  clearly  an  interpreta¬ 
tion  by  the  storyteller  as  well.  Oral  histories  and  story  traditions  fulfilled  important  social 
and  cultural  roles  in  pre-literate  societies.  They  disseminated  vital  information,  taught 
accepted  behavior  and  practices,  and  entertained.  Modern  western  people  face  challeng¬ 
es  to  understanding  and  appreciating  oral  traditions — first,  because  stories  come  to  us 
through  the  filter  of  ethnographers  or  ethnohistorians;  and  second,  because  oral  histories 
and  lore  from  pre-literate  peoples  do  not  fit  with  modern  western  patterns  of  knowledge 
and  thinking,  which  value  linear  sequence  and  chronology.10

Biographical  Sketch 

Edward  Johnston  was  a  clerk  and  naturalist  for 
the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Fisheries  aboard  the  steamer 
Albatross  before  becoming  an  agent  on  the  Seal 
Islands.  When  not  working  in  Alaska,  he  resided 
at  his  poultry  farm  in  Petaluma,  Sonoma  County, 
California,  with  his  wife  and  son.17  After  Johnston 
died,  a  friend  recalled,  “Edward  Johnston  was 
happiest  when  he  could  leave  behind  the  cares  of 
the  office  and  spend  a  few  day  and  nights  [collect¬ 
ing  specimens]  in  some  of  the  beautiful  collecting 
locales  of  the  West.”18 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Edward  Johnston  became  a  government  agent 
at  the  Seal  Islands  in  1919,  and  brought  his  wife, 
Ella,  to  the  island  at  that  time.  He  filled  his  spare 
time  as  a  botanist,  butterfly  and  moth  taxono¬ 
mist,  and  avid  photographer.  For  further  relax¬ 
ation,  Johnston  “increased  the  known  species  of 
Heterocera  [moths]  from  eight  to  twenty  species” 
on  the  Pribilof  Islands.19 

According  to  a  letter  written  by  former 
Pribilof  Islands  Fur-Seal  Program  Director  C. 
Howard  Baltzo,  the  California  Academy  of 
Sciences  in  San  Francisco  was  the  conservator  of 
Johnstons  photographic  collection.  The  archive 
reportedly  included  approximately  thirty-six 
glass  plate  portraits  of  Pribilof  Native  families, 
one  hundred  ninety-two  5x7-inch  glass  plate 
negatives,  and  about  five  hundred  nitrate  film 
negatives  of  Pribilof  plants.  Johnston  intended  to 
insert  the  plant  photographs  in  his  three-volume 
manuscript  of  the  islands’  botany.  Apparently  the 
text  became  dated  and  was  deemed  unworthy 
of  publication,20  while  the  family  portraits  went 
missing.21  Very  much  to  the  surprise  and  delight 
of  the  authors,  in  February  2008  the  missing 
negatives  were  found  in  a  former  Naval  Air  Field 
hangar  at  Sand  Point  in  Seattle,  Washington,  by 
NOAA  photo  archivist  Gina  Rappaport.22  The 
hangar  is  part  of  the  NOAA  Western  Regional 
Center  campus  along  the  western  shoreline  of 


Superintendent  Edward  Clyde  Johnston, 
St.  Paul  Island,  circa  1942.  (Fredericka 
Martin  Photograph  Coll.,  91-223-16,

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Lake  Washington.  Gina  Rappaport  and  the  pres¬ 
ent  authors  were  well  along  with  the  draft  of 
Pribilof  Islands,  Alaska:  Guide  to  the  Photographs 
and  Illustrations  when  Rappaport  re-examined 
historical  collections  attributed  to  Dr.  Victor 
Scheffer  and  noticed  a  wooden  box  among 
Scheffer’s  collection  with  a  return-address  ship¬ 
ping  label  from  G  Dallas  Hanna.  She  lifted  the 
wooden  cover  to  find  the  negatives,  which  includ¬ 
ed  thirty-two  portraits  rather  than  thirty-six,  238 
5x7-inch  glass-plate  botanical  negatives,  and  455 
film  negatives.  Taken  at  St.  George  Island  during 
December  1922,  the  exquisite  portraits  represent 
many  of  the  families  still  residing  on  the  islands 
in  2008.  These  portraits  are  presented  in  Pribilof 
Islands,  Alaska:  Genealogy  and  Census,24  as  well 
as  in  the  aforementioned  Guide  to  Photographs 
and  Illustrations. 

Superintendent  Johnston  was  in  charge  when  the  Pribilof  Natives  were  evacuated 
during  WWII  after  a  Japanese  attack  at  Dutch  Harbor  in  the  Aleutian  chain.  One  assumes 
that  Johnston  wrote  out  of  naivete  and  not  duplicity  in  a  letter  to  Mr.  G.  Donald  Gibbins, 
vice  president  of  the  Fouke  Fur  Company: 

All  our  people — white  and  natives — are  established  at  Funter  Bay  on  the  west  side  of  the 
northern  tip  of  Admiralty  Island.  It  is  about  50  miles  from  Juneau — 20  minutes  by  airplane. 

The  St.  Paul  section  is  quartered  at  an  abandoned  cannery  on  one  side  of  the  bay  and  the 
St.  George  section  at  an  abandoned  mine  on  the  opposite  side.  It  is  about  one  mile  straight 
across  or  two  miles  around  the  beach  at  the  head  of  the  bay.  The  locations  are  not  bad  and 
with  some  lumber  for  repairs  and  partitions  in  large  bunkhouses  (and  many  other  things) 
some  degree  of  comfort  may  be  obtained.  We  were  exceedingly  lucky  that  the  evacuation 
was  not  ordered  in  early  winter  as  it  takes  considerable  time  to  get  500  men,  women 
and  children  comfortably  settled  for  the  winter.  We  are  greatly  indebted  to  the  Forestry 
Service,  the  Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs,  as  well  as  cannery  and  mine  owners,  for  the  fullest 
cooperation.  Everyone  has  been  willing  to  donate  their  services  and  equipment  whenever 
possible.25 

Johnston  apparently  did  not  recognize  that  one  of  the  most  infamous  tragedies  in 
Aleut  history  under  United  States  rule  was  unfolding  under  his  watch.  The  story  remains 
vivid  today  for  those  who  survived  the  ordeal  in  crowded,  unheated,  and  unhealthy  quar¬ 
ters.  This  story  became  the  subject  of  several  books,  including  Slaves  of  the  Harvest:  The 
Story  of  the  Pribilof  Aleuts26  and  When  the  Wind  Was  a  River 27  It  has  also  been  vividly 
portrayed  in  several  film  documentaries,  including  Aleut  Story, 28  The  Aleutians:  Cradle  of 
the  Storms  29  and  People  of  the  Seal .30

Former  Pribilof  Islands  naturalist

ment  service  in  1913  as  Deputy  Commissioner 
of  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Fisheries,  a  post  he  held 
for  two  years.  He  was  appointed  Superintendent 
(Director)  of  the  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey 
in  1915,  and  remained  in  that  position  until 
his  death  in  1929.33  On  a  leave  of  absence  from 
this  position,  he  served  in  the  U.S.  Signal  Corps 
during  World  War  I  and  rose  in  rank  to  Colonel, 

Division  of  Military  Aeronautics,  1st  Army  Air 
Service.  For  his  meritorious  service,  Jones  was 
made  an  Officer  of  the  Order  of  S.S.  Maurizio 
and  Lazzaro  and  Fatigue  de  Guerre  by  the  King 
of  Italy.  His  concern  after  the  war  for  returning 
soldiers  and  their  welfare,  particularly  for  their 
ability  to  assimilate  into  the  workforce,  led  him 
to  organize  the  first  American  Legion  Post— no. 

1,  in  Washington,  D.C.34  NOAA’s  former  Chief  of 
the  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey  was  described  in 
a  biographical  sketch  (excerpted): 

In  addition  to  his  duties  as  Director  of  the  Coast 
and  Geodetic  Survey,  Colonel  Jones  served  as 
Commissioner  of  the  Internal  Boundary  between 
the  United  States  and  Canada  and  Alaska  and  Canada,  from  February  1921  until  his  death. 

He  was  a  member  of  the  Aerial  Patrol  Commission  of  the  United  States.35 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

In  1914,  E.  Lester  Jones  was  in  the  midst  of  a  general  investigation  into  the  status  of 
Alaskan  fisheries  when  on  short  notice  he  was  dispatched  to  the  Pribilof  Islands  to  look 
into  allegations  of  improprieties  by  some  of  the  government’s  employees  there.  He  sum¬ 
marized  his  original  intentions  in  Alaska: 

By  direction  of  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  [Redfield],  I  was  instructed  to  proceed  to 
Alaska  (1)  in  order  to  make  a  thorough  survey  and  investigation  of  the  various  fishery 
industries,  (2)  to  visit  the  fur-seal  fisheries  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  and  make  studies  in 
connection  therewith  for  the  purpose  of  formulating  a  more  definite  and  businesslike 
policy  for  the  administration  of  those  islands,  and  (3)  to  inquire  into  the  status  of  the  minor 
fur-bearing  animals,  including  both  the  matter  of  the  protection  of  the  wild  stock  and  the 
development  of  the  industry  of  rearing  such  animals  in  captivity.36 

Then  he  received  orders  to  cut  short  his  current  investigations  at  Seward  and  “pro¬ 
ceed  at  once  to  those  islands  [Pribilofs]  to  investigate  irregularities  in  regard  to  the  con¬ 
duct  of  certain  Government  officials.”37  He  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  on  July  10,  1914,  and 
subsequently  telegraphed  Secretary  Redfield: 

I  wired  Commissioner  [of  Fisheries]  yesterday  recommending  that  immediate  preparations 
be  made  for  new  agents  on  islands,  as  evidence  so  far  positively  warrants  these  charges. 

Would  earnestly  urge  Navy  Department  to  act  in  case  of  Wireless  Operator  McClenny,  now 
on  St.  George’s  Island,  as  charges  against  him  are  very  serious.38

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


In  his  two  weeks  on  the  island,  Jones  did  look  into  administrative  matters  including 
current  conditions  for  the  Natives  and  details  of  a  study  of  fox  herds  on  both  islands. 
(He  left  the  review  of  the  sealing  industry  to  other  experts.)  He  introduced  his  published 
report  with  a  restatement  of  the  islands’  importance: 

There  is  probably  no  part  of  Alaska  concerning  which  more  interest  is  manifested  than  the 
Pribilof  Islands,  in  Bering  Sea.  The  fact  that  they  are  the  breeding  ground  of  the  largest 
rookeries  of  fur  seals  in  the  world  make  them  not  only  of  great  interest  but  a  valuable  asset 
to  the  United  States  Government.39 

But  he  also  dealt  with  the  charges  of  gross  misconduct  by  several— not  all  —gov¬ 
ernment  officials  on  both  inhabited  islands  (see  Alvin  Whitney  biography  for  additional 
information). 

Among  the  charges  that  have  been  lodged  against  the  principal  Government  agents  on 
the  Pribilof  Islands  are  debauching  the  wives  of  natives,  terrorizing  their  husbands  into 
silence,  drunkenness  and  furnishing  intoxicants  to  the  natives,  creating  a  condition  in  the 
community  that  has  resulted  in  death  and  lawlessness,  and  permitting  the  unlawful  killing 
of  fur  seal  pups.40 

An  investigation  was  made  of  charges  against  the  agent  and  caretaker,  and  the  storekeeper 
on  St.  Paul  Island,  and  against  the  agent  and  caretaker  on  St.  George  Island.  Nothing  was 
left  undone  to  bring  about  a  fair  and  full  hearing,  and  testimony  of  all  the  white  employees 
on  both  islands,  as  well  as  of  a  large  number  of  natives,  was  taken  and  the  investigation  was 
sweeping  and  impartial.  It  showed  beyond  a  question  of  doubt  that  a  deplorable  condition 
has  existed  on  these  islands  for  years,  and  resulted  in  the  dismissal  from  the  service  of  both 
men  on  St.  Paul  Island.  All  Government  officials  who  have  allowed  the  morals  of  the  islands 
to  be  disturbed  have  violated  their  oath  of  office  and  are  guilty  of  gross  misconduct  if  not  of 
criminal  negligence.41 

Jones’  report  was  wide-ranging:  the  overall  living  conditions  of  the  Natives;  housing; 
Native  beer,  or  quass;  schools;  Native  wages,  supplies,  and  rations;  occupations;  new  of¬ 
fices  and  salaries  for  responsible  government  officials;  physicians;  hospital  stewards;  need 
for  a  temporary  dentist;  improvements  required  at  the  Government  House  and  Company 
House;  janitor  service;  distribution  of  seal  meat;  the  possibility  of  cattle  raising;  roads  for 
St.  George  Island;  supply  ship  costs  and  the  installation  of  aerial  cable  and  lighters  for 
unloading  ships;  and  improvement  of  landing  regulations.  The  report  also  included  his 
separate  personal  addresses  to  the  Natives  of  St.  George  Island,  July  17, 1914,  and  St.  Paul 
Island,  July  20,  1914.  Jones  concluded  his  report: 

The  whole  Pribilof  Islands  problem  may  be  summarized  thus:  If  moral,  intellectual,  and 
general  conditions  are  to  be  improved;  if  the  business  of  the  islands  is  to  be  carried  on 
along  businesslike  lines  (and  surely  the  proposition  of  these  islands,  including  the  fur-seal 
and  fox  herds,  is  largely  commercial),  then  the  situation  must  be  viewed  from  an  entirely 
different  standpoint  than  hitherto;  for  the  returns  the  Government  is  to  receive  from  its 
investment  warrant  the  expenditure  of  a  sum  of  money  large  enough  to  give  the  officials  of 
the  Government  and  the  natives  civilized  surroundings,  and  provide  adequate  means  and 
necessary  facilities  to  accomplish  a  proper  administration  of  the  affairs  of  these  islands.42 

Jones’  investigation  led  to  the  dismissal  of  several  employees  and  court-martial  of  the 
Navy  employee.  Additional  improvements  to  the  islands  were  forthcoming.

Genealogy 

David  Starr  Jordan  was  born  on  January  19,  1851, 
at  Gainesville,  Wyoming  County,  New  York,  to 
Hiram  Jordan  (b.  February  12,  1809)  and  Huldah 
Lake  (Hawley)  Jordan  (b.  July  9, 1812  in  Whitehall, 

New  York).  While  a  student  at  Cornell,  David 
Jordan  met  his  first  wife,  Susan  Bowen  (1845- 
1885),  whom  he  married  in  1875.  David  and 
Susan  Jordan  had  three  children:  Edith,  Harold, 
and  Thora,  before  Susan  died  in  1885.  With  his 
second  wife,  Jessie  Knight  (m.  1887),  David  Jordan 
had  three  more  children:  Knight  Starr,  Barbara, 
and  Eric  Knight.  David  Starr  Jordan  died  at  Santa 
Clara,  California,  on  September  19,  1931.43 

Biographical  Sketch 

David  Starr  Jordan  was  educated  at  his  home¬ 
town  school  in  Gainesville,  New  York.  He  was  a 
devoted  student  of  science,  especially  astrono¬ 
my  and  botany,  and  was  offered  a  scholarship  to 
Cornell  University  in  1869.  After  graduation  from  Cornell  in  1872,  he  taught  botany;  his 
wife  Susan  was  also  a  trained  botanist. 

Jordan  furthered  his  formal  education  with  an  MD  from  Indiana  Medical  College 
(1875)  and  a  PhD.  from  Butler  University  (1878).  He  had  been  strongly  influenced  by 
Louis  Agassiz  after  attending  a  summer  school  session  taught  by  the  renowned  ichthyolo¬ 
gist  in  1873.  Jordan  in  turn  became  the  leading  American  ichthyologist.  He  published  645 
works  on  fishes  and  1,372  publications  on  a  wide  variety  of  other  topics.  In  his  cataloging 
of  fishes  from  many  parts  of  the  world,  he  collected  information  on  7,800  species.  Jordan’s 
publications  were  compiled  in  a  bibliography  by  Alice  N.  Hays,  published  by  Stanford 
University  Press  in  1952. 

Jordan  was  not  only  a  student  and  teacher  of  science  but  also  a  leader  in  the  educa¬ 
tional  and  political  arenas.  He  was  president  of  Indiana  University  (1885-1891),  president 
of  Leland  Stanford  Junior  University  (1891-1913),  and  Chancellor  Emeritus  of  Stanford 
University  (1913-1916).

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


While  occupied  with  academic  duties,  Jordan  found  time  to  take  part  in  many  other 
scientific  and  educational  activities,  and  even  political  discussions.  From  1879  until 
1890,  he  was  closely  associated  with  the  United  States  Fish  Commission;  in  1880,  he  was 
in  charge  of  fishery  investigations  on  the  Pacific  coast;  and  in  1896-1897,  he  was  the 
American  representative  on  the  commission  for  studying  the  fur  seals  in  the  Bering  Sea.  He 
was  always  active  in  organizations  for  the  abolition  of  war.  His  varied  reminiscences  were 
published  in  1922  in  two  volumes  entitled  The  Days  of  a  Man.*4 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

David  Starr  Jordan’s  direct  connection  with  the  Pribilof  Islands  began  in  1896,  when 
Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  Charles  Sumner  Hamlin  requested  his  assistance  in 
a  special  investigation  of  the  Seal  Islands,  known  as  the  Fur-Seal  Commission  of  1896- 
1897,  or  as  the  Jordan  Commission.  Dr.  Jordan  agreed  to  head  the  commission;  he  chose 
several  scientists  from  the  U.S.  National  Museum  and  the  U.S.  Fish  Commission’s  steam¬ 
er  Albatross  to  assist  him,  along  with  several  dedicated  students  of  science  at  Stanford 
University,  his  personal  secretary,  and  an  agent  of  the  U.S.  Treasury  at  the  Pribilof  Islands. 
The  investigation  was  “an  outgrowth  of  a  belief  on  the  part  of  the  United  States  that  the 
regulations  formulated  by  the  Paris  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  ‘for  the  protection  and  pres¬ 
ervation  of  the  fur  seal’  had  failed  to  accomplish  their  avowed  object.”45 

Congress  passed  an  act  that  outlined  the  organization  of  the  Commission; 

Resolved  by  the  Senate  and  House  of  Representatives  of  the  United  States  of  America  in 
Congress  assembled,  That  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  be,  and  is  hereby,  authorized  to 
expend,  from  any  moneys  in  the  Treasury  not  otherwise  appropriated,  a  sum  sufficient  to 
provide  for  the  employment  of  persons  to  conduct  a  scientific  investigation,  during  the 
fiscal  years  eighteen  hundred  and  ninety-six  and  eighteen  hundred  and  ninety-seven,  of  the 
present  condition  of  the  fur-seal  herds  on  the  Pribilof,  Commander,  and  Kuril  islands  in  the 
North  Pacific  Ocean  and  Bering  Sea,  said  amount  not  to  exceed  for  both  said  years  the  sum 
of  five  thousand  dollars. 

The  Secretary  is  also  authorized  to  employ  a  stenographer  in  connection  with  this 
investigation  at  a  rate  of  compensation  not  exceeding  one  thousand  five  hundred  dollars 
per  annum,  and  to  pay  his  compensation  and  expenses  out  of  any  moneys  in  the  Treasury 
not  otherwise  appropriated. 

The  President  is  authorized  to  detail,  for  the  purposes  of  assisting  in  this  investigation,  any 
officer  or  officers  or  employees  of  the  United  States  Government,  their  actual  expenses 
and  the  expenses  of  the  person  or  persons  employed  under  the  preceding  paragraph  to 
be  paid  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  out  of  any  moneys  in  the  Treasury  not  otherwise 
appropriated. 

The  President  may  detail  a  vessel  of  the  United  States  for  the  purpose  of  carrying  out  this 
investigation.46

Members  of  the  commission  were  to  report  their  findings  to  the  Secretary  of  the 
Treasury.  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  Hamlin  instructed  Jordan: 

The  principal  object  of  this  investigation  is  to  determine  by  precise  and  detailed 
observations  first,  the  present  condition  of  the  American  fur-seal  herd;  second,  the  nature 
and  imminence  of  the  causes,  if  any,  which  appear  to  threaten  its  extermination;  third, 
what,  if  any,  benefits  have  been  secured  to  the  herd  through  the  operation  of  the  act  of 
Congress  and  act  of  Parliament  based  upon  the  award  by  the  Paris  Tribunal  of  Arbitration; 
fourth,  what,  if  any,  additional  protective  measures  on  land  or  at  sea,  or  changes  in  the 
present  system  of  regulations  as  to  the  closed  season,  prohibited  zone,  prohibition  of 
firearms,  etc.,  are  required  to  insure  the  preservation  of  the  fur-seal  herd.  Your  inquiries 
should  furthermore  be  extended,  in  so  far  as  the  time  and  circumstances  permit  to  embrace 
the  consideration  of  all  important  questions  relating  to  the  natural  history  of  the  seal  both 
at  sea  and  on  the  islands,  with  special  reference  to  their  bearing  upon  the  sealing  industry.50 

Added  to  the  general  instructions  was  a  list  of  thirteen  specific  questions  for  which 
Congress  sought  answers,  covering  such  topics  as  the  effect  of  pelagic  sealing,  destruc¬ 
tion  of  nursing  pups,  mortality  of  seals  on  the  islands,  travel  routes  of  the  seal  herd,  seal 
breeding  habits  and  food  supplies,  and  whether  the  Alaskan  fur  seals  were  intermingling 
with  the  Asiatic  herds — all  this  with  a  $5,000  budget. 

From  the  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s  Log  on  September  8,  1896,  at  the  close  of  the  com¬ 
mission’s  first  season: 

Every  one  feels  that  the  investigation  carried  out  under  Dr.  Jordan’s  efficient  lead  will  be 
sure  to  result  in  some  measures  to  be  put  in  force  toward  doing  away  with  pelagic  sealing  at 
least.  He  has  certainly  left  no  stone  unturned.  He  has  been  ably  served  by  every  member  of 
the  Commission  and  they  have  all  worked  harmoniously  together. 

The  branded  seal  pups  are  reported  to  be  doing  first  rate.  Messer’s  Macoun  and  Barrett- 
Hamilton  have  begun  making  a  collection  of  fungi.51 

At  the  end  of  the  second  season  the  commission  summarized  its  findings,  which  were 
reported  in  the  New  York  Times: 

The  primary  cause  of  shrinkage  of  females  on  the  breeding  ground  is  the  pelagic  catch  of 
last  Fall  and  this  Spring.  To  this  is  added  the  loss  due  to  starvation  of  orphaned  pups  in 
1894,  which  should  this  year  have  lived  to  give  birth  to  their  first  pups.  This  starvation  in 
1894  affecting,  as  it  did,  in  a  like  measure  the  male  herd,  is  the  cause  of  the  diminution  of 
the  killable  seals  on  the  hunting  grounds. 


373 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


The  decline  of  the  herd  is  everywhere  more  distinctly  marked  than  it  was  last  year  owing 
to  the  effects  of  the  resumption  of  pelagic  killing  in  Bering  Sea  after  the  modus  vivendi  of 
1893.  For  1898  the  shrinkage  will  be  still  greater.  The  evil  effects  of  pelagic  sealing  in  any 
particular  year  are  still  more  clearly  felt  three  and  four  years  after.  Even  if  pelagic  sealing 
should  be  stopped  at  once,  the  decline  of  the  herds  must  go  on  until  after  1900. 

The  pelagic  fleet  in  Bering  Sea  numbers  about  29  vessels,  as  against  68  last  year.  The  report 
of  the  catches  shows  that  they  were  unprofitable.  No  seizures  have  been  made.  The  only 
new  fact  discovered  this  year  has  been  that  a  parasitic  worm  infesting  the  sandy,  rocky 
areas  is  the  cause  of  a  large  part  of  the  early  mortality  among  pups  which  was  ascribed  in  a 
general  way  last  year  to  trampling. 

The  early  mortality  as  a  whole  shows  a  decrease  relative  to  the  decreased  number  of 
animals.  The  branding  of  young  female  seals  which  will  be  begun  after  Sept.  1,  will  be 
carried  on  by  Col.  Murray,  chief  agent  on  the  islands,  and  Mr.  F.  F.  Farmer,  electrician.  The 
skins  of  the  branded  cows  returned  this  year  to  the  islands  show  clearly  the  permanency 
of  the  mark,  and  its  efficiency  to  render  the  skin  un-salable  without  injury  to  the  animal 
or  to  the  herd.  Branding  has  the  same  effect  upon  the  fur  seal  herd  that  branding  calves  or 
shearing  sheep  on  those  animals.  The  idea  that  the  seals  might  be  driven  away  by  branding 
is  sheer  nonsense. 

The  salt  lagoon  on  St.  Paul  Island  has  been  fenced  and  the  males  too  young  to  be  killed  this 
year  will  be  herded  there  until  the  close  of  the  pelagic  sealing.52 

At  the  close  of  the  Fur-Seal  Commission  investigations  in  1897,  the  United  States,  Canada, 
Britain,  Russia,  and  Japan  met  in  Washington,  D.C.,  to  discuss  the  findings.  After  much 
debate,  an  agreement  was  reached  to  reduce  pelagic  sealing.  Excerpts  from  Jordan’s  pre¬ 
sentation  were  published  in  the  press: 

Within  the  past  two  years  it  has  several  times  been  proposed  that  we  should  settle  the  fur 
seal  question  once  and  for  all  by  the  slaughter  of  the  entire  herd  on  its  breeding  grounds. 

It  is  scarcely  necessary  to  point  out  that  this  course  of  action  would  not  accomplish  the 
desired  end.  As  the  animals  are  never  all  present  at  one  time  on  the  islands,  a  remnant 
would  be  left,  which  in  time  would  revive  the  herd,  and  with  it  the  whole  question.  In  the 
meantime  every  objection  which  has  been  urged  against  pelagic  sealing  would  be  justly 
chargeable  against  such  a  slaughter.  The  proposition  is  an  abominable  one,  without  a  single 
redeeming  feature. 

The  fur  seal  is  the  noblest  of  all  the  mammals  of  the  sea.  From  the  naturalist’s  point  of  view 
it  is  one  of  the  most  interesting  forms  of  life  on  the  earth.  From  the  commercial  view  it  is 
one  of  the  most  valuable.  Unlike  the  buffalo,  the  elk,  the  stag,  and  like  animals,  it  occupies 
territory  that  cannot  be  used  for  any  other  purpose.  Where  the  former  animals  once 
roamed  great  cities  have  sprung  up,  but  the  haunts  of  the  fur  seal  would  be  deserted  for  all

The  Fur-Seal  Commission  published  three  volumes  of  their  report  (Parts  1,  2,  and 
4)  in  1898,  and  a  fourth  volume  (Part  3)  in  1899  (David  Starr  Jordan,  editor,  The  Fur 
Seals  and  Fur-Seal  Islands  of  the  North  Pacific  Ocean,  U.S.  Dept  of  the  Treasury,  Doc. 
2017,  Washington,  DC:  GPO).  Part  1  concerned  the  history  of  the  problem  and  the  main 
phases  of  the  controversy.  Part  2  contained  the  detailed  journal  of  daily  observations  and 
abstracts  from  the  St.  Paul  Agents’  Log  of  twenty  years,  as  it  pertained  to  seal  habits.  Part 
3  addressed  detailed  scientific  and  special  reports,  with  the  findings  of  national  science 
experts.  Part  4  included  the  reports  of  Leonhard  Stejneger  respecting  his  investigation 
on  Commander  and  Kuril  Islands  (the  Russian  fur-seal  islands).  The  total  cost  to  the  U.S. 
Treasury  for  the  1896-1899  Commission  was  $45,000.

On  January  1,  1909,  twelve  years  after  the  Fur-Seal  Commission  of  1897,  and  as  the 
North  American  Commercial  Company’s  twenty-year  lease  to  harvest  fur  seals  on  the 
Pribilof  Islands  was  approaching  its  end,  management  of  the  Alaskan  Fur-Seal  Service 
was  placed  under  the  auspices  of  the  Bureau  of  Fisheries.54  Secretary  of  Commerce  and 
Labor,  Oscar  S.  Straus,  asked  the  following  experts  to  be  part  of  an  Advisory  Board  of  the 
Fur-Seal  Service: 

Fur-Seal  Board 

David  Starr  Jordan,  Chairman 
Leonard  Stejneger 
Frederic  A.  Lucas 
Edwin  A.  Sims 
Charles  H.  Townsend 

Commission  of  Fisheries 

Barton  W.  Evermann,  Chair 
Walter  I.  Lembkey 
Millard  C.  Marsh 

George  M.  Bowers,  Commissioner  of  Fisheries 
Hugh  M.  Smith,  Deputy  Commissioner  of  Fisheries 
Harry  D.  Chichester,  Assistant  Fur  Seal  Agent 
George  A.  Clark,  Special  Scientific  Expert 

Dr.  Jordan’s  leadership  of  scientific  investigations  in  the  Seal  Islands  was  a  key  factor 
in  influencing  the  attitude  of  the  governments  of  the  United  States  and  other  nations 
toward  conservation  management. 

The  government  assumed  all  administrative  and  management  responsibility  for  the 
fur-seal  industry  in  the  Pribilofs,  effective  May  1,  1910,  and  with  it  forever  ended  the  leas¬ 
ing  program.  In  the  fall  of  that  year,  the  first  full-time  naturalist,  Dr.  Walter  Hahn,  began 
work  on  the  islands.  This  and  other  major  changes  in  administration  and  management  of 
the  fur-seal  industry  were  soon  followed  by  the  Fur-Seal  Treaty  of  1911,  hailed  as  the  first 
international  wildlife  conservation  treaty.  With  an  act  of  Congress  it  put  an  end  to  com¬ 
mercial  sealing  for  five  years  and  prohibited  the  importing  of  sealskins  by  the  signatory 
nations — thus  effectively  putting  an  end  to  pelagic  sealing.55 

In  an  interview  with  author  Barrett  Willoughby,  former  Pribilof  Islands  Agent  Watson 
Colt  Allis  said,  “I  remember  a  day  when  Dr.  David  Starr  Jordan  unexpectedly  met  an  ‘idle’ 
bull  in  the  grass  at  the  top  of  a  cliff.  The  beast  lunged  at  him.  Both  rolled  together  to  the 
bottom.  The  doctor  managed  to  escape  with  only  a  sprained  ankle.  It  was  while  he  was 
confined  to  the  house  afterward  that  he  wrote  his  famous  seal  classic  Matka”56  Matka 
and  Kotik  became  an  extremely  popular  children’s  story,  published  in  several  editions.

Genealogy 

James  Judge  was  born  July  22,  1867,  at  Columbus,  Franklin  County,  Ohio,  to  Irish  immi¬ 
grants  John  and  Bridget  (Higgins)  Judge.5  James  had  one  brother,  Frank  J.,  and  six  sisters: 
Mary,  Margaret,  Catherine,  Bettie,  Lida,  and  Annie,  all  of  whom  were  born  and  lived  in 
Columbus.  James  Judge  married  Helen  Sultzer  (born  August  1870  in  Ohio)  on  May  12, 
1894,  in  Cook  County,  Illinois.58  James  Judge  died  at  Columbus,  Ohio,  on  September  13, 
1919,  and  was  interred  at  Mt.  Calvary  Cemetery  in  Columbus.59 

Biographical  Sketch 

James  Judge  was  educated  in  public  schools  and  graduated  from  a  business  college.  He 
worked  as  a  clerk  and  retail  grocer  before  entering  government  service.  The  1904  person¬ 
nel  vita  on  James  Judge  noted  that  he  was  qualified  as  a  lawyer.60 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

James  Judge  and  his  new  bride  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  on  June  6,  1894.  He  was  sworn  in 
by  Agent  Joseph  B.  Crowley  as  a  special  agent  of  the  Treasury  on  July  1, 1894,  and  assigned 
duty  as  agent-in-charge  of  the  seal-killing  program.  He  was  made  special  agent-in-charge 
from  August  29,  1894,  until  the  return  of  Agent  Crowley  on  June  10,  1895.  James  and 
Helen  Judge  remained  on  St.  Paul  Island  until  September  14, 1895,  when  they  departed  on 
the  revenue  cutter  Corwin  for  San  Francisco.  The  Judges  returned  to  the  Pribilof  Islands 
on  June  15,  1896.  James  served  as  assistant  agent  on  St.  George  Island  until  July  1,  1898. 
Then  he  was  assigned  to  St.  Paul  Island  from  August  21,  1898,  until  August  11,  1899,  first 
as  assistant  agent  appointed  from  Ohio's  12th  Congressional  District  of  Franklin,  then  as 
agent  following  the  death  of  Agent  Joseph  Murray  in  August  1898.  (Judge  assumed  the 
duties  as  agent  before  his  position  as  assistant  agent  was  officially  terminated  on  October 
31,  1898.)  As  to  his  duties:  “the  agent  has  charge  of  matters  pertaining  to  the  fur-seal 
fisheries  of  Alaska,  including  relations  with  lessees  of  the  seal  islands  and  the  natives, 
guarding  the  seal  herds,  custody  of  buildings  and  Government  property.”61  Judge  served 
on  St.  Paul  Island,  with  short  intervals  of  leave,  until  1912. 

James  and  Helen  Judge  both  actively  sought  to  assist  the  St.  Paul  Island  Native  com¬ 
munity,  particularly  during  a  deadly  epidemic  of  measles  in  1900.62  James  helped  with 
capital  improvements  on  St.  Paul  Island:  a  Native  carpentry  shop,  blacksmith  shop, 
gun  house,  movie  theater  behind  the  Native  carpentry  shop,  and  a  telephone  line  from 
Zapadni  Rookery  to  beyond  Middle  (Polovina)  Hill.  The  Judges  were  also  instrumental  in 
the  growth  and  development  of  the  island’s  Native  culture— and  some  imported  culture 
as  well:

not  ge  through  them.  A  great  many  sea  otter  were  in  the  cave  east  of  the  village.  The  cave 

at  the  time  was  much  bigger  than  at  present.  The  men  used  to  walk  all  around  inside  the 

e  and  needed  a  lantern  to  see.  They  went  just  to  look  around.  Sea  otter  used  to  have 

heir  young  there.  Sea  otter  have  no  regular  breeding  season.  Sea  otter  were  never  known 

e  up  on  t  e  ground  [land].  At  that  time  there  were  lots  of  walrus  at  S  E  Point— the 

narrow  bay  between  Sea  Lion  Point  and  Tolstoi  point  was  called  amagatha  togomulga-

walrus  bay.  Walrus  are  polygamous  and  came  there  to  breed.  EofF  remembers  seeing  them 
there.  They  were  exterminated  by  being  killed  on  the  rookery.  The  Russians  did  the  killing 
to  get  the  ivory  and  skins.  The  natives  are  of  the  opinion  that  other  walrus  would  have 
come  had  the  Russian  taken  the  carcasses  from  the  rookery. 

At  the  time  sea  lions  extended  from  Sea  Lion  Point  considerably  beyond  Garden  Cove. 

They  estimated  way  inland.  A  story  is  told  of  some  men  in  a  barabara  when  some  sea  lions 
crawled  over  the  roof  and  it  gave  way  precipitating  the  animals  down  upon  the  men.  In 
the  struggle  that  ensued  one  of  the  men  had  his  leg  bitten  off  by  a  sea  lion.  He  died  from 
the  effects  of  the  wound.  Another,  at  another  time,  man  lost  his  life  by  a  sea  lion  [illegible] 
on  him  while  they  making  the  . . .  [drive?].  Both  those  men  were  at  work  on  the  sea  lion 
skins.  There  were  two  barabaras.  At  that  time  there  were  two  villages  on  the  island — one 
at  Zapadni.  The  other  at  Staraya  Artel.  The  men  worked  Garden  Cove  every  spring  and 
summer  to  take  sea  lion  skins. 

Sea  lions  hauled  out  at  two  places  on  Zapadni.  These  were  shot  on  the  rookeries  by  the 
Russian  officers.  They  did  it  to  get  the  [illegible]  sinew,  etc.  rather  than  the  skins.  The 
largest  rookery  began  2  Vi  miles  west  of  the  watch  house  and  extended  around  such 
[illegible]  point  about  Vi  mile.  The  other  rookery  began  at  rock  just  south  of  present 
breeding  ground  of  seals  and  extended  about  Vi  mile.  The  carcasses  were  left  on  the  rookery 
and  natives  think  that  the  reason  that  other  sea  lions  never  came  there  afterwards. . . .  Sea 
lions  were  killed  just  south  of  where  the  village  now  stands.  At  that  time  seals  were  not 
driven  from  East  rookery  at  all.  They  began  to  drive  East  Rookery  when  the  village  was  first 
erected  where  it  now  stands.  When  it  was  determined  to  build  the  present  village,  fires 
were  built  in  the  vicinity  of  the  seals  &  sea  lions  to  drive  them  away.  It  was  necessary  to 
keep  the  fires  going  for  a  long  time,  and  day  and  night  before  the  animals  all  left.  All  those 
old  men  were  born  on  the  present  village  site  in  community  houses.  There  was  only  one  of 
those  houses  and  every  family  in  the  village  lived  under  that  roof.  The  agent  had  a  house  for 
himself.  One  family  would  have  5#  of  flour  every  month,  l 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9A#  of  tea.  Sugar  about  1  lb. . . . 

The  agent  used  to  make  the  quass  and  deal  it  out.  The  young  men  got  none.  There  was 
plenty  to  drink  at  the  dances.  Two  kinds  of  dances— native  -  Russian.  The  natives  made 
their  own  music.

Kashevaroff,  Phillip 

Pelagic  Sealer 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Phillip  Kashevaroff  was  not  a  Pribilovian,  although  he  very  likely  had  relatives  residing  in 
the  Pribilof  Islands.  But  because  his  deposition  for  the  Fur-Seal  Tribunal  of  Arbitration 
presented  an  illuminating  perspective  from  a  pelagic  sealer,  it  is  transcribed,  in  part, 
below.  Kashevaroff  deposed  before  Treasury  Agent  Albert  W.  Lavender  on  April  1 1, 1892. 
Phillip  Kashevaroff  stated: 

Am  47  years  old;  born  at  and  reside  in  Sitka.  Am  by  occupation  a  mariner.  The  last  year  I 
spent  hunting  seal  on  the  schooner  Allie  Alger.  First  seal  were  seen  olf  Sitka  Sound  in  May 
by  me.  We  followed  the  seals  as  far  as  Sand  Point  on  Unger  [sic:  Unga]  Island.  The  shotgun 
was  used  altogether  for  taking  seal.  About  three  seal  are  secured  out  of  every  ten  shot.  The 
majority  of  seal  are  cows  with  pup.  Everything  is  killed  that  comes  near  the  boat.  I  think 
the  seal  are  about  as  plentiful  along  this  coast,  but  much  more  scarce  farther  west.  The 
cause  of  this  scarcity  is  too  much  pelagic  hunting.  Last  year  I  was  not  in  Bering  Sea,  but 
was  on  the  Russian  side.  Have  taken  cows  seals  full  of  milk  30  miles  from  Copper  Islands. 

Did  not  see  any  big  bulls  on  Attu  Islands.  I  think  if  sealing  in  Bering  Sea  was  stopped  and 
the  indiscriminate  killing  of  cows  was  stopped,  seal  would  again  become  plentiful  along  the 
coast.  When  I  was  with  the  Russian  Company,  I  spent  six  years  looking  for  rookeries,  but 
was  unable  to  find  any  place  where  the  fur  seal  hauled  out  elsewhere  than  on  the  Pribilof 
Islands.1

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Louis  Kimmel  provided  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  with  interesting  information  about 
the  mortality  of  fur  seals  ancillary  to  the  harvest  at  the  Pribilof  Islands.  Such  information 
was  used  by  the  Tribunal  in  making  its  decisions  about  the  impacts  of  pelagic  sealing  and 
land  harvests  on  the  fur-seal  population.  Kimmel  deposed  before  Notary  Public  Svellon 
A.  Brown  at  Washington,  D.C.,  on  March  25,  1892:

I  am  a  resident  of  La  Fayette,  Indiana,  and  am  63  years  of  age.  During  the  years  1882  and 
1883  was  the  assistant  Treasury  Agent  located  on  St.  George  Island  of  the  Pribilof  Group.  I 
arrived  on  the  island  May  31,  1882,  and  remained  there  continuously  until  the  later  part  of 
July,  1883. 

After  every  "drive”  that  took  place  while  I  was  on  the  island  I  went  back  over  the  ground 
along  which  the  seals  had  been  driven  to  see  if  any  seals  had  been  killed  by  overdriving. 
The  entire  number  of  seals  killed  in  all  these  “drives”  did  not  exceed  one  hundred,  and  the 
majority  of  them  were  killed  by  the  large  seals  crushing  the  smaller  ones  to  death.  In  every 
case  of  a  seal  being  killed  on  the  “drive,”  I,  as  Government  agent,  imposed  a  fine  in  order 
that  they  might  be  more  careful  in  the  future.5

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Jacob  Kotchooten  provided  the  following  histori¬ 
cal  information  about  changes  in  the  seal  harvest 
process  as  part  of  his  deposition  for  the  Tribunal 
of  Arbitration.  Kotchooten  deposed  before 
Treasury  Agent-in-Charge  William  H.  Williams 
at  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska,  on  June  8,  1892: 


Jacob  Kochutin,  St.  Paul  Island, 

1930.  (NARA,  Pacific  Alaska  Region, 
Anchorage,  RG  22,  Administrative 
Correspondence,  ca.  1888-1987.) 


Alexandra  Kochutin  died  April  15,  1947,  on  St. 
Paul  Island,  Alaska.19  Agent  Daniel  C.  R.  Benson 
wrote  in  the  log,  “Alexandra  Kochutin  passed 
away  at  7:00  am.  She  was  the  island’s  oldest  resi¬ 
dent  and  would  have  been  84  next  month.”20 


Biographical  Sketch 

Jacob  Kochutin  spent  his  life  as  a  sealer. 
Government  Agent  Harry  Peterson  wrote  about 
Kotchooten  in  his  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s  Log: 

Jacob  Kochutin,  age  80  years,  died  at  4:30  p.m. 
today  of  Myocarditis.  He  is  survived  by  his  wife, 

Alexandra,  and  son,  Theodore.  Jacob  was  the  oldest 
native  on  the  island  and  is  honorably  remembered 
for  his  long  and  faithful  service  here.  He  had  the 
reputation  of  being  the  fastest  and  most  efficient 
seal  skinner  and  it  is  probable  that  he  has  skinned 
more  of  these  animals  than  any  sealer  since  1867.21 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 


I  am  a  native  of  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska,  and  I  am  40  years  of  age.  I  am  a  native  sealer,  and 
have  worked  among  seals  on  St.  Paul  Island  all  my  life,  and  I  remember  when  I  was  first 
rated  a  man,  some  twenty-three  years  ago;  it  was  when  Kerrick  Buterin  was  chief,  and  he 
used  to  follow  us  up  when  we  went  to  drive  seals,  and  tell  us  to  walk  along  as  slow  as  we 
could,  so  as  not  to  tire  the  seals  or  worry  them  in  any  way. 

In  1879  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  built  a  salt  house  about  2  miles  from  Halfway 
Point,  and  after  that  the  seals  were  never  driven  more  than  2  miles. 

Ten  or  twelve  years  ago  the  rookeries  and  sea  were  full  of  seals,  but  now  there  is  not  a 
great  many;  we  used  to  kill  85,000  in  less  than  two  month’s  time  on  St.  Paul  Island,  and  our 
people  earned  plenty  of  money  to  buy  everything  they  wanted,  and  in  the  winter  we  killed 
2,000  to  3,000  male  pups  for  food  and  clothing.  Now  we  are  not  allowed  to  kill  any  more 
pups,  and  only  7,500  male  seals  for  food,  and  our  people  are  very  much  worried  to  know 
what  is  to  become  of  themselves  and  children.22

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

In  his  deposition  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration,  Nicoli  Krukoff,  as  second  chief,  pro¬ 
vided  the  following  insights  about  the  seal  harvest  at  St.  Paul  Island.  Krukoff  deposed 
before  Treasury  Agent-in-Charge  William  H.  Williams  at  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska,  on  June 
8,  1892: 

I  am  43  years  of  age  and  was  born  at  Sitka,  Alaska.  I  can  read  and  speak  the  Russian, 

Aleut,  and  English  languages.  I  came  to  St.  Paul  Island  in  1869,  and  have  been  here  ever 
since,  constantly  employed  among  the  fur  seals,  and  I  have  had  daily  experience  in  all  the 
branches  of  the  business,  from  driving  the  seals  to  preparing  the  skins  for  shipment,  and 
I  am  at  present  the  second  chief  on  St.  Paul  Island,  to  which  position  I  was  appointed  in 
1891. 

The  driving  is  all  done  by  our  own  people  under  direction  of  the  chiefs  and  we  never  drive 
faster  than  about  half  a  mile  in  one  hour.  We  very  seldom  drive  twice  from  one  rookery  in 
one  week  and  very  few  cows  get  into  a  drive  before  the  middle  of  August. 

The  Government  has  forbidden  us  to  kill  any  more  pups  and  we  get  other  meat  instead. 

All  our  people  know  the  seal  are  getting  scarcer  every  year  and  we  think  it  is  because  of 
the  schooners  coming  in  and  shooting  the  cows  in  the  sea.  Sometimes  they  try  to  land  on 
the  rookeries,  but  we  drive  them  off  with  guns  and  they  never  get  many  seals  that  way.  We 
earn  very  little  wages  now,  and  we  expect  the  Government  to  keep  us  in  food  and  clothing. 

Unless  the  schooners  are  stopped  the  seals  will  all  be  gone  soon  and  then  I  do  not  know 
what  my  people  can  do  for  a  living;  they  know  nothing  of  other  work  and  there  is  nothing

Hanson  (Hansen)  by  1895.36  Nestor  married  Nellie  Golovin  on  August  28,  191 1. 3  Nellie 
was  born  May  23,  1892,  at  Morzhovi,  Alaska.38  She  was  apparently  an  orphan  residing  at 
the  Jesse  Lee  Home  in  Unalaska,  which  may  have  contributed  to  the  discrepancies  in  the 
St.  Paul  Island  census  records  which  cite  both  Morzhovi  and  Unalaska  as  her  birthplac¬ 
es.39  Nestor  and  Nellie  Kushin  had  one  son,  John  Hunter  Kushin,  born  at  St.  Paul  Island, 
October  3,  1914.40  Nestor  died  March  27,  1916.41  Aggie  Kushin  died  September  12,  1900, 
of  “capillary  bronchitis  super-induced  by  measles.”42 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Aleut  sealer  Aggie  Kushin  expressed  his  concern  about  the  impact  of  pelagic  sealing  not 
only  on  the  seal  population  but  also  upon  the  Pribilof  Islands’  Native  community.  He  de¬ 
posed  before  Treasury  Agent-in-Charge  William  H.  Williams  on  St.  Paul  Island,  on  June 
6,  1892: 

I  was  born  at  Simshoe,  Kurile  Islands,  and  am  37  years  of  age.  I  came  to  St.  Paul  Island 
in  1867  and  have  resided  here  ever  since.  I  can  read  and  write  in  the  Russian  and  Aleut 
languages,  and  am  able  to  interpret  the  one  into  the  other;  and  I  understand  the  English 
language  fairly  well.  At  present  and  for  several  years  past  I  am  assistant  priest  in  the  Greek 
Catholic  Church.  My  occupation  on  the  island  is  that  of  native  sealer,  and  I  have  been  such 
since  1870. 1  have  a  thorough  knowledge  of  the  taking  of  fur  seals  for  skins  in  all  its  details 
as  it  has  been  done  on  St.  Paul  Island  since  1870. 

I  never  saw  many  sealing  schooners  before  1884,  but  they  have  been  coming  more  and 
more  every  year  since,  and  I  notice  that  as  the  schooners  multiply  in  the  sea  the  seals 
decrease  on  the  rookeries.  I  do  not  mean  to  say  that  the  seals  were  injured  because  a  few 
were  killed  on  the  rookeries,  when  men  from  schooners  landed  on  the  islands  in  the  night 
or  when  the  fog  was  very  thick,  for  the  number  killed  in  that  way  never  amounted  to  much, 
as  it  is  not  often  the  raiders  can  land  on  a  rookery  and  escape  with  their  plunder.  When, 
in  1886,  we  all  saw  the  decrease  of  seals  upon  the  hauling  ground  and  rookeries,  we  asked 
each  other  what  was  the  cause  of  it,  but  when  we  learned  that  white  men  were  shooting 
seal  in  the  water  with  guns  we  knew  what  was  the  matter;  we  knew  that  if  they  killed  seals 
in  the  water  that  they  must  be  nearly  all  females  that  were  going  out  to  feed,  because  the 
males  stay  on  the  islands  until  they  get  ready  to  go  away  in  the  fall  or  winter. 

I  never  heard  any  of  the  old  men  who  have  lived  here  for  fifty  years  before  my  time  speak 
of  such  a  thing  as  sickness  or  death  among  the  seals.  We  eat  the  flesh  of  the  seal  and  it 
constitutes  the  meat  supply  of  the  natives,  and  seals  from  two  to  five  years  old  have  been 
killed  by  them  for  food  every  week  during  their  stay  on  the  land  ever  since  the  islands  were 
peopled,  and  no  one  has  yet  found  a  diseased  seal  either  young  or  old. 

When  I  first  came  here  seals  used  to  be  driven  from  Half  way  [sic]  Point  to  the  village,  a 
distance  of  about  six  miles;  and  from  Zapadnie  to  the  village  a  distance  of  nearly  five  miles. 

Wet,  or  very  damp,  cool  weather  was  chosen  for  such  drives,  and  we  started  the  drive 
at  about  six  o’clock  at  night  and  driving  all  night  reached  the  village  at  from  six  to  eight 
o’clock  next  morning. 

The  seals  are  never  driven  at  a  greater  speed  than  one  mile  in  three  hours;  and  the  men 
who  do  the  driving  have  to  relieve  each  other  on  the  road  because  they  travel  so  slowly  they 
get  very  cold. 

No  one  knows  better  than  the  natives  that  our  prosperity  is  in  the  protection  of  the 
seals.  They  are  our  food  supply,  and  our  earnings  from  taking  the  skins  enable  us  to  live 
comfortably.  Should  the  Company  desire  us  to  kill  female  seals,  every  native  in  the  village 
would  be  interested  in  having  the  Government  officer  know  it.43

Agent,  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury,  St.  George  Island,  1891-1893 
Genealogy 

Albert  Webster  Lavender  was  born  August  22, 

1842,  at  White  Point,  Queens,  Nova  Scotia, 

Canada,1  to  Allen  Lavender  and  Catherine 
(Hoffman)  Lavender.  Allen  Lavender’s  family  had 
English  roots  and  had  established  itself  in  South 
Carolina  during  colonial  days.  The  family  relocat¬ 
ed  to  Nova  Scotia  after  the  Revolutionary  War,  as 
they  retained  English  sympathies,  but  eventually 
returned  to  the  United  States  and  settled  on  Cape 
Cod.  Albert’s  father,  Allen  Lavender,  was  born  at 
Charleston,  South  Carolina,  and  became  a  sea 
captain.  Catherine  Hoffman,  of  Dutch  heritage, 
was  born  in  New  York’s  Mohawk  Valley.2 

Albert  Webster  Lavender  married  Mary

South  Dakota),6  Albert  Lavender  married  Deborah  Rooke  Wynn  (born  in  Yankton,  South 
Dakota),  a  widow  with  one  son,  Frank  Wynn.  Deborah  Rooke  Lavender  died  October  18, 
1911,  and  Albert  Lavender  died  on  December  24,  1916,  both  in  Yankton,  South  Dakota. 

Biographical  Sketch 

Albert  Lavender’s  father  and  seven  of  Albert’s  uncles  served  as  captains  of  ocean-go¬ 
ing  craft  in  the  days  when  American  clippers  were  known  on  every  sea.  Captain  Albert 
Lavender,  three  of  his  brothers,  and  many  of  his  cousins  followed  the  family  tradition  by 
commanding  saltwater  vessels.8  Because  of  illness,  Albert  was  compelled  to  give  up  the 
sea  and  in  1872  had  settled  in  South  Dakota,  where  he  became  a  businessman.  In  1890, 
he  sold  his  grocery  and  general  store  in  Scotland,  South  Dakota 

to  accept  an  appointment  as  special  agent  of  seal  fisheries  for  the  Federal  government, 
serving  throughout  President  Benjamin  Harrison’s  administration. ...  He  kept  guard  over 
the  seals  in  the  Pribyloff  islands,  limited  the  killing  of  the  animals  and  prevented  illegal 
sealing,  serving  until  June  15,  1893.  He  did  not  know  until  that  date  that  Grover  Cleveland 
was  a  candidate  for  the  presidency  and  had  been  elected.  He  was  ordered  to  report  at 
Washington  and  in  September  of  the  same  year  arrived  again  in  Yankton,  though  he  was 
frequently  called  upon  in  Washington  for  information  until  the  following  December.9 

Captain  Albert  Lavender’s  time  in  the  Pribilof  Islands  was  only  one  of  many  action- 
filled  and  rewarding  life  experiences.  Excerpts  from  his  biography  in  the  History  of  Dakota 
Territory,  vol.  5,  by  George  Kingsbury  illustrate  not  only  Captain  Lavender’s  personality 
but  also  the  type  of  man  who  served  on  the  Pribilof  Islands. 

Captain  Lavender  of  this  review  was  actively  connected  with  seafaring  from  the  age  of 
eight  or  nine  years,  and  yet,  is  frank  enough  to  confess  that  he  never  left  port  without  being 
seasick  for  a  longer  or  shorter  period.  From  early  boyhood  he  went  with  fishing  fleets  to  the 
banks  of  Newfoundland  and,  working  his  way  upward,  was  for  thirteen  years  in  command 
of  vessels.  For  ten  years  he  represented  the  same  firm,  sailing  out  of  New  York,  and  he  has 
visited  every  port  of  any  importance  on  the  five  continents,  in  Australia  and  in  the  islands 
of  the  South  Sea.  His  many  years  of  life  at  sea  at  length  affected  his  throat  and  while  at 
Buenos  Aires,  South  America,  his  voice  was  lost  completely  as  a  result  of  bronchitis.  A  sea 
captain  without  a  voice  is  like  a  ship  without  a  rudder  and  so  he  decided  to  quit  the  sea  for 
a  time.  An  uncle  at  Yankton  [South  Dakota]  recommended  that  he  try  the  western  climate 
and  the  11th  of  January,  1872,  witnessed  his  arrival  in  Dakota.  Today  he  is  one  of  the  most 
widely  known  citizens  of  Yankton.  He  has  been  identified  with  many  lines  of  business  in 
this  state  and  has  held  various  offices  of  trust  in  the  service  of  the  national  government. 

After  reaching  Yankton  he  purchased  a  grocery  business,  in  which  he  engaged  from  1872 
until  1879.  He  then  opened  a  general  store  in  connection  with  his  grocery  and  at  the  same 
time  established  a  branch  store  in  Scotland  [SD].  In  1882  he  sold  his  Yankton  store,  but 
continued  business  in  Scotland  until  1890,  when  he  sold  out. . . . 

On  his  return  to  Yankton  Captain  Lavender  purchased  cattle.  He  had  previously  engaged 
in  that  business  while  conducting  his  store  and  he  continued  to  deal  in  cattle  until  the 
Spanish-American  War,  when  he  was  appointed  paymaster  in  the  navy,  serving  on  the 
flagship  Cincinnati,  most  of  the  time  in  Cuban  waters.  The  Cincinnati  was  about  thirty 
miles  east  of  Santiago  when  they  heard  the  guns  of  battle.  At  full  speed  she  raced  along 
the  coast,  hoping  to  get  into  the  battle,  but  arrived  only  in  time,  after  a  chase  of  eighty  or 
ninety  miles,  to  see  the  last  vessel,  the  Santa  Maria,  sinking.  Captain  Lavender  was  the  only 
paymaster  chosen  from  civil  life  and  because  he  could  speak  Spanish  he  was  sent  aboard 
the  Santa  Maria  to  receive  the  surrender  of  the  vessel.  He  remained  in  the  naval  service 


392 


Biographies  L  ♦  Lavender  -  Lembkey 


until  January  1,  1899,  when  he  resigned  and  returned  to  Yankton,  since  which  time  he  has 
been  upon  the  road  for  the  Excelsior  Mill  Company,  buying  produce  which  he  ships  to 
larger  markets.  He  is  thoroughly  familiar  with  all  trade  conditions  in  his  territory  and  is 
one  of  the  best  salesmen  on  the  road.10 

Captain  Lavender  has  been  familiar  with  the  history  of  Dakota  from  the  early  territorial 
days  when  Indians  were  hostile  and  soldiers  were  continually  passing  to  and  fro  between 
the  forts  and  army  posts.  He  was  in  Yankton  when  General  Custer  arrived  there  in  the 
midst  of  a  three  days’  snow  storm,  covering  April  12,  13  and  14,  1873.  He  lived  in  the 
territory  through  the  period  of  the  grasshopper  scourge  and  the  hard  times  caused  by 
drought.  During  the  flood  of  the  spring  of  1881  he  was  one  of  the  rescue  party  and  with 
a  launch  of  a  steamer  and  a  crew  he  spent  two  weeks  in  constant  rescue  work,  returning 
to  town  only  when  assured  that  all  settlers  along  the  bottoms  of  the  Missouri  and  James 
rivers  were  safe.  He  rescued  two  hundred  and  fourteen  at  Gayville  alone  and  more  than 
that  number  from  farm  houses  or  on  barns  or  hay  stacks,  where  they  had  taken  refuge 
throughout  the  flooded  districts.  Many  there  are  who  owe  their  lives  to  Captain  Lavender’s 
untiring  efforts  in  their  behalf  and  all  but  one  from  the  flooded  districts  were  brought 
out  alive.  He  was  in  Chicago  with  a  shipment  of  cattle  on  the  12th  of  January,  1888,  and 
therefore  missed  the  fearful  blizzard  of  that  date.  Among  his  many  souvenirs  and  trophies 
of  the  long  years  which  he  spent  at  sea  is  a  mass  of  melted  Spanish  money  from  the  Santa 
Maria,  which  is  both  curious  and  artistic,  resembling  antique  Chinese  carving  of  grotesque 
figures.  He  has  one  mass  weighing  eleven  pounds  in  the  First  National  Bank  at  Elk  Point. 

His  son  in  Colorado  has  another  of  the  four  given  him  on  the  Santa  Maria  and  the  fourth 
he  presented  to  a  friend  in  Washington.11 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Albert  Lavender  was  the  Treasury  Agent  at  St.  George  Island  during  the  years  1891-93. 
His  deposition  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  offered  some  additional  insight  into  the 
extent  of  pelagic  sealing.  Lavender  was  deposed  by  Notary  Public  C.  L.  Hooper  on  June 
7,  1892,  in  Alaska: 

I  am  49  years  of  age,  a  citizen  of  the  United  States,  and  a  resident  of  Scotland,  South 
Dakota.  I  am  now,  and  have  been  for  two  years  past,  employed  as  special  agent  of  the 
Treasury  Department,  assigned  to  duty  as  agent  in  charge  of  St.  George  Island.  While 
in  Unalaska  in  September,  1891,  awaiting  transportation  to  San  Francisco,  I  had  an 
opportunity  to  examine  personally  the  seal  catch  of  the  steam-sloop  Challenge,  which  had 
been  warned  out  of  the  sea,  and  was  undergoing  repairs  at  the  harbor  named.  The  catch 
amounted  to  172  skins,  which  were  all  taken  in  Berhing  Sea  at  various  distances  from  the 
seal  islands,  and  of  this  number  only  three  were  those  of  male  seals,  one  of  these  being  an 
old  bull,  and  the  other  two  being  younger  males.12

At  the  age  of  nine,  Walter  Lembkey  was  residing  with  his  uncle,  Justice  of  the  Peace  John 
J.  Rankin,  and  attending  public  school  in  Bellefonte,  Pennsylvania.  He  graduated  from 
Columbia  University  in  New  York  City  in  1893,  with  an  LLM  degree.  Before  entering 
government  service,  Lembkey  was  an  editor  for  a  local  newspaper,  general  secretary  of 
the  YMCA,  and  deputy  recorder  of  deeds;  he  also  dealt  in  general  real-estate  business.  As 
a  college  student  he  had  earned  money  as  a  clerk-copyist  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  the 
Treasury  from  1890  to  1892. 16 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Walter  Lembkey  was  appointed  assistant  agent  of  the  seal  fisheries  on  March  22,  1899, 
through  the  Sixth  County  Congressional  District  of  Pennsylvania.  His  wife,  Grace,  and 
their  daughter,  Julia,  accompanied  him.  Lembkey  was  later  promoted  to  agent,  with  “gen-

eral  charge  of  all  matters  pertaining  to  the  fur-seal  fisheries  of  Alaska,  including  relations 
with  lessees  of  the  seal  islands  and  the  natives,  guarding  the  seal  herds,  custody  of  build¬ 
ings  and  Government  property.”17 

During  his  first  year  on  St.  Paul  Island,  an  issue  arose  regarding  funds  held  by  the 
North  American  Commercial  Company  (NACC)  for  the  translation  of  the  “Russian 
Church  Ritual”  into  Aleut.  The  resident  priest  and  Native  chiefs  asked  Assistant  Agent 
Lembkey  to  write  an  official  letter  on  their  behalf  to  the  NACC.  Lembkey  wrote  to  NACC 
Agent  J.  C.  Redpath: 

Office  of  Special  Agent  Treasury  Department 
St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska 
August  14,  1899 
Mr.  J.C.  Redpath 

Agent,  N.A.  Commercial  Company 
Sir: 

At  a  recent  conference  between  Mr.  Morton,  the  Treasury  Agent  in  charge,  and  the  natives 
of  this  Island,  the  latter  expressed  a  wish  that  the  amount  of  money  now  on  deposit  with 
your  company,  contributed  in  past  years  by  the  natives  of  this  Island,  for  the  translation  of 
their  Church  Ritual  from  Russian  into  Aleut,  be  paid  by  you  to  the  Russian  Consistory  at 
San  Francisco,  it  being  understood  that  a  portion  of  the  Ritual  has  already  been  translated. 

In  this  request  Mr.  Morton  acquiesced  and  directed  me  to  issue  an  order  for  the  amount. 

You  are  therefore  hereby  requested  to  pay  to  Rev.  Nicholi  Reeseff,  the  resident  priest  on  this 
Island  of  the  Russian  Church,  the  amount  above  referred  to,  amounting  to  fifteen  hundred 
and  ninety  two  dollars  and  eighty  four  cents  ($1,592.84)  the  amount  to  be  forwarded  by 
him  to  the  Russian  Consistory  at  San  Francisco,  to  be  placed  to  the  credit  of  the  natives  of 
this  Island,  for  the  translation  above  referred  to. 

This  letter  shall  constitute  your  voucher  for  the  payment  of  the  above  amount. 

Respectfully  yours, 

W.J.  Lembkey  Treas.  Agent,  St.  Paul  Island 

Received  the  above  amount  from  transmission  to  the  Russian  Ecclesiastical  Consistory  at 
San  Francisco,  to  be  used  in  translating  the  Church  Ritual  from  the  Russian  Language  into 
Aleut.

Later,  Agent  Lembkey  became  embroiled  in  struggles  with  the  marauding  pelagic 
sealers.  Beginning  in  the  mid- 1880s  and  throughout  most  of  the  first  decade  of  the  twen¬ 
tieth  century,  American  and  Canadian  pelagic  sealers  killed  hundreds  of  thousands  of  fur 
seals  in  the  Bering  Sea.  Greed  emboldened  some  sufficiently  to  dare  to  land  on  the  shores 
of  the  Seal  Islands.  Usually  under  the  shroud  of  the  nearly  omnipresent  fog,  the  maraud¬ 
ers  would  land  and  kill  many  fur  seals.  Some  of  these  pirates  were  captured  and  their 
vessels  seized,  thanks  to  the  bravery  of  the  islanders.  Deadly  force  was  always  a  prospect, 
but  it  never  came  to  pass  until  1906. 

The  Japanese  had  been  totally  unprepared  for  pelagic  sealing  in  the  waters  around 
northern  Japan,  where  fur  seals  passed  during  their  annual  migration.  Eventually  the 
Japanese  awoke  to  the  many  foreigners,  primarily  Americans  and  Canadians,  reaping  huge

profits  in  their  backyard  from  natural  resources 
including  sea  otters  and  fur  seals.  That  realization, 
stoked  by  their  own  desire  for  big  profits,  motivat¬ 
ed  Japanese  fishers  to  take  bold  moves.  In  1893, 
the  Imperial  Fisheries  Company  (Dai  Nippon 
Suisan  Kaisha)  outfitted  the  Chishima  no.  1  and 
the  Chishima  Maru  no.  3  for  pelagic  sealing.19  Not 
bound  by  the  Paris  Arbitration  Tribunal  decision, 

Japan  moved  eastward.  In  time,  market  changes 
and  U.S.  laws  essentially  eliminated  competition 
by  American  and  Canadian  pelagic  sealers  sail¬ 
ing  out  of  North  America,  but  the  same  factors  in 
turn  encouraged  Japan  to  move  in  for  the  kill  and 
American  sealers  to  sail  under  Japanese  colors.20 

In  July  1906,  Agent  Lembkey  reported  at  least 

thirteen  Japanese  sealing  schooners  surround-  Walter,  Julia,  and  Grace  Lembkey,  circa

mg  St.  Paul  Island,  killing  seals  both  outside  and  iv.) 

inside  the  three-mile  territorial  limit.  He  observed 

that  with  the  Japanese  pelagic  sealers  hovering  off 

the  coast,  just  the  process  of  counting  seals  on  the 

rookeries  would  work  disadvantageously  toward 

protecting  the  seals. 

this  island  [St.  Paul]  after  July  15  was  surrounded 
by  a  large  fleet  of  Japanese  pelagic  schooners 
hunting  seals  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the 
island.  To  have  continued  counting  under  these 
circumstances  would  have  involved  the  driving  off 
the  rookeries  of  large  numbers  of  female  breeding 
seals  to  fall  the  prey  of  pelagic  hunters  within  sight 
of  land.21 


Possibly  emboldened  by  the  presence  of  so 
many  compatriots,  Japanese  sealers  decided  to 
raid  St.  Paul  Island  at  Northeast  Point  on  July  16, 

1906,  with  fatal  consequences.  Several  Japanese 
sealers  were  killed  by  an  armed  island  guard. 

Coincidentally,  Edwin  W.  Sims,  Esq.,  solicitor 
with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  and 
Labor,  arrived  a  few  days  after  the  raid  and  re¬ 
corded  accounts  of  the  incident.  Sims’  report  honored  Agent  Lembkey  and  the  island’s 
Aleut  guard  and  attested  to  the  stressful  conditions  facing  the  island  inhabitants  during 
the  pelagic  sealing  era.22  (See  Edwin  W.  Sims  biography  for  appropriate  excerpts  of  the 
reporting  of  the  Japanese  raid.)

The  U.S.  Consul  in  Hokodate,  Japan,  estimated  that  the  1906  Japanese  pelagic  seal¬ 
ing  fleet  took  7,000  seals  around  the  Pribilof  Islands.  Agent  Lembkey  contended  that 


397 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


that  number  was  low  if  one  considered  the  inefficiencies  of  pelagic  sealing — that  is,  the 
number  of  seals  recovered  was  small  in  proportion  to  those  killed  by  pelagic  sealers.  In 
comparison,  the  North  American  Commercial  Company  take  of  sealskins  in  1906  totaled 
14,476.  Adding  the  number  taken  by  Canadian  sealers,  with  figures  put  forward  by  the 
London  trade  sales  for  “Northwest  coast”  skins,  the  1906  pelagic  take  in  the  Bering  Sea 
totaled  27,216.23 

Despite  the  deaths  of  the  Japanese  marauders  at  the  hands  of  the  Americans,  pelagic 
sealers  continued  to  approach  the  Pribilof  Islands.  Reading  the  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s 
Log  for  1906  reveals  the  relative  magnitude  of  the  incursions  around  St.  Paul  and  Otter 
Islands,  as  well  as  some  of  the  frustrations  associated  with  those  distractions.  In  the  early 
1900s  more  revenue  cutters  began  to  patrol  the  Bering  Sea  against  pelagic  sealers,  but  not 
until  1907,  the  year  after  the  deaths  of  the  Japanese  sealers,  did  the  revenue  cutter  patrols 
around  the  Pribilofs  become  more  forceful. 

The  patrol  about  the  islands  during  the  summer  of  1907  was  energetic  and  by  far 
the  most  active  put  forward  in  the  history  of  the  islands.  There  is  no  question  that  the 
captains  in  command  of  the  cutters  used  every  effort  to  prevent  landings  and  to  capture 
schooners  within  the  three-mile  limit.24 

Even  so,  Japanese  efforts  to  kill  seals  showed  no  sign  of  decreasing,  and  weather  con¬ 
ditions,  including  fog  and  strong  winds,  shielded  the  pelagic  sealers  from  detection  and 
aided  them  in  escape.  Lembkey  recorded  several  incidents  in  the  1907  St.  Paul  Island 
Agent’s  Log. 

July  18,  1907 

While  hauling  in  the  skins  which  lay  near  the  well  house  . . .  the  company’s  teamster 
Edward  met  three  Japanese  sailors,  who  with  packs  on  their  backs,  were  walking  overland 
to  the  village.  He  ordered  them  into  the  wagon  and  drove  with  them  into  the  village. 

The  men  could  not  speak  English  and  none  in  the  village  could  talk  Japanese.  The  Chinese 
laundryman,  however,  by  writing,  could  make  out  here  and  there  a  word  in  common,  and, 
after  giving  them  something  to  eat,  which  they  requested  by  means  of  pantomime,  they 
were  brought  to  the  Government  House  and  an  attempt  was  made  to  ascertain  the  facts  in 
connection  with  their  landing.

Biographies  L  ♦  Lembkey 


After  a  great  deal  of  trouble  and  conflicting  statements  due  to  misunderstanding  on  both 
sides,  their  statement  amounted  to  the  facts  that  they  were  of  the  schooner  EUN  MARU, 
sailing  from  Sindai,  Japan,  of  48  tons  burden,  and  carried  25  men  and  7  boats.  The  master’s 
name  was  Kimdo  Skiroka.  On  July  17,  they  approached  the  island  in  search  of  water  and 
struck  a  rock,  sinking  in  45  minutes.  None  of  the  crew  were  drowned.  These  men  did  not 
know  what  became  of  the  other  boats.  They  made  signs  immediately  upon  arrival  that 
they  wanted  food.  The  leader  showed  on  the  map  of  the  island  the  location  of  their  landing 
which  was  in  the  neighborhood  of  Lincoln  Bight.  They  were  given  quarters  in  the  Seduli 
house. 

They  had  quite  heavy  packs  on  their  backs  when  they  arrived  at  the  village,  consisting  of 
clothing,  ammunition  box,  with  shell  loaded  and  empty,  and  two  shotguns,  one  10  and  one 
12  gauge.  In  the  afternoon,  after  arriving  at  their  quarters,  the  men  changed  their  clothing 
and  appeared  very  well  dressed. 

It  is  hard  to  believe  the  statement  that  their  ship  was  wrecked,  especially  since  they  had 
all  their  clothing  with  them,  guns,  compasses,  etc.,  and  cannot  account  for  the  other  men 
in  the  crew.  They  probably  are  deserters.  They  tried  to  explain  to  the  Chinese  who  acted 
as  interpreter  that  the  captain  was  rough  with  them,  and  went  through  a  pantomime  of 
striking  and  tying  the  hands  behind  the  back.  They  repeated  the  story,  however,  several 
times  of  the  ship’s  having  been  wrecked.  The  interpreting  was  done  through  the  Chinese 
writing  characters  on  paper  which  were  shown  to  the  Japanese,  who  in  turn  wrote 
characters  on  paper  in  reply.  How  much  of  this  either  side  could  understand  is  conjectural. 

July  19,  1907 

The  watchman  sent  yesterday  to  explore  the  North  Shore  to  ascertain  whether  the 
statement  made  by  the  Japanese  castaways  to  the  effect  that  their  schooner  struck  a  rock 
and  sunk  is  correct,  returned  last  night  about  midnight.  They  state  that  nothing  can  be  seen 
of  any  wrecked  ship.  Their  boat  was  hauled  up  on  the  North  Shore  near  Lincoln  Bight.  It 
contained  six  oars,  six  row-locks,  1  sail,  1  water-cask,  full,  one  bottle  of  water,  one  long  pole 
with  three  hooks,  2  rain  coats  and  one  sou’wester. 

The  watchmen  [sic]  further  reported  that,  when  he  was  in  the  vicinity  of  West  Point,  he  saw 
16  schooners  and  about  30  small  boats,  the  latter  all  operating  in  the  vicinity  of  West  Point. 

...  Of  the  30  boats  seen,  6  were  well  inside  the  3-mile  limit,  and  only  about  400  yards  from 
shore.  Upon  seeing  the  watchmen  approaching,  the  boats  turned  and  made  away  as  rapidly 
as  they  could. 

This  is  the  record  day  for  schooners.  The  sixteen  seen  on  the  North  and  West  sides  are 
supplemented  by  7  more,  reported  by  the  watch  at  North  East  Point,  at  the  other  extreme 
of  the  island.  This  makes  23  schooners  in  sight  from  the  island  in  one  day. 

Prom  the  fact  that  nearly  all  the  boats  from  the  16  schooners  on  the  west  side  operated  in 
the  vicinity  of  West  Point,  it  must  be  believed  that  the  seals,  in  traveling  about  the  island 
converge  at  this  point  in  the  swift  currents  that  make  past  this  locality  as  the  tide  ebbs  and 
flows.  The  sealers  have  been  quick  to  grasp  this  fact,  and  to  take  advantage  of  it,  as  shown 
by  their  hovering  in  that  place  whenever  the  weather  is  favorable. 

The  infamous  Toyai  Maru  involved  in  the  1906  raid  returned  to  haunt  the  Bering  Sea 
in  1907.  This  time  the  crew  from  the  cutter  Perry  boarded  the  Japanese  sealer  to  find  “sev¬ 
eral  white  men  aboard.”  According  to  the  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s  Log  entries  below,  the 
Japanese  sealers  Kinzai  Maru  nos.  1,  2,  and  3  also  had  white  men  aboard,  and  the  owner 
was  purported  to  be  the  wife  of  the  U.S.  Consul  to  Japan,  Mr.  I<ing.-D 

June  19,  1907 

At  6  p.  m.,  a  telephonic  message  was  received  from  the  watchmen  at  North-East  Point  to 
the  effect  that  three  schooners  were  in  sight  to  the  N.  W.  of  the  point,  and  sailing  directly 
in.  The  guard  was  instructed  by  the  Chief,  at  my  instance,  not  to  all[ow]  any  boat’s  crew 


399 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


to  land  but  to  fire  warning  shots,  should  it  be  attempted.  At  7  p.  m.,  I  had  the  second  chief 
[give]  a  call  up  the  Point,  and  it  was  reported  that  two  of  the  schooners  were  about  6  miles 
out,  and  were  not  moving,  but  that  one  of  them  was  coming  in,  and  was  at  that  time  about 
4  miles  off  shore. 

The  guard  was  instructed  to  keep  the  village  advised  as  often  as  possible. 

June  20,  1907 

The  watchmen  at  North-East  Point  report  this  morning  that  the  MANNING  was  lying  to 
the  westward  of  Hutchinson  Hill,  in  the  same  position  where  the  schooners  were  lying  last 
night.  The  schooners,  however,  were  out  of  sight. 

June  21,  1907 

Mr.  and  Mrs.  Judge  drove  to  North-East  Point  this  afternoon.  In  the  evening  . . .  Mr.  Judge 
telephoned  that  a  schooner  had  been  seen  by  the  guard  there  this  morning,  presumably 
about  8  miles  out. 


June  22,  1907 

At  about  1:30,  the  cutter  [MANNING]  got  under  way,  steering  in  the  direction  of  Otter 
Island.  There  she  fell  in  with  two  schooners  that  evidently  had  been  hidden  behind  the 
island.  It  is  stated  that  one  of  the  schooners  was  towed  by  the  Cutter  toward  the  Village. 

. . .  The  other  schooner  sailed  in  a  Westerly  direction.  It  is  not  known  whether  any  of  the 
schooners  mentioned  were  seized. 

A  telephonic  message  from  Mr.  Judge  at  North-East  Point  contained  the  information  that, 
at  7  o’clock,  there  were  two  schooners  in  sight  from  that  place.  Both  were  a  considerable 
distance  from  the  Island.  There  were,  therefore,  four  schooners  sighted  today. 

Watch  was  changed  at  North-East  Point  today,  four  men  taking  the  places  of  those  who 
have  been  on  watch  there  during  the  week. 

June  24,  1907 

A  schooner  was  seen  to  the  Eastward  of  Otter  Island  and  several  miles  away.  Evidently  she 
had  boats  out,  as  she  remained  in  one  position  for  a  long  time. 

June  25,  1907 

About  1:30  in  the  afternoon,  native  men  who  were  watching  from  the  village  hill  reported 
that  three  small  boats  were  in  the  vicinity  of  Otter  Island  ...  it  was  seen  to  fire  from  shot¬ 
guns.  The  smoke  from  the  guns,  as  they  were  fired,  could  be  plainly  seen  with  glasses. . . . 

I  observed  the  two  boats  to  land  at  Otter  Island  and  the  crews  to  go  ashore  there  and 
enter  the  house.  Evidently  there  were  no  seals  on  the  Island,  for  the  boat’s’  [sic]  crews  soon 
reimbarked. . . .  Evidently  they  were  the  crews  of  two  schooners  lying  in  the  directions 
taken  by  the  boats. 

About  7  p.m.,  the  PERRY  was  sighted  some  distance  off  West  Point.  She  anchored  on  the 
West  side  about  9  p.m. . . .  The  Captain  stated  that  he  had  boarded  the  schooner  to  the 
N.W.  sighted  this  morning,  to  which  one  of  the  boats  at  Otter  Island  evidently  belonged. 

The  Captain  also  told  me  that  the  prize  which  he  captured  off  the  Island  the  other  day  and 
took  to  Unalaska  was  released  on  order  of  Captain  Munger,  fleet  captain,  on  the  ground 
that  the  evidence  obtainable  showing  her  culpability  was  not  sufficient  to  justify  her 
being  held  for  court.  No  sealskins  were  found  in  the  boats,  but  arms  and  all  other  sealing 
paraphernalia  were  in  them  when  taken  inside  the  3-mile  limit.  It  is  a  question  in  my  mind 
whether  the  evidence  did  not  justify  the  sending  of  the  captain  and  the  crews  of  the  boats 
to  Valdez,  as  the  section  of  the  Alaska  Criminal  code  which  provides  penalties  for  attempts 
states  that  if  a  person  attempts  to  commit  crime,  "and  in  such  attempt  does  any  act  toward 
the  commission  of  such  crime,  but  fails  or  is  intercepted  in  the  perpetration  thereof,”  he 
shall  be  punished  upon  conviction.  (Sec.  192,  March  3,  1899.)  There  is  no  doubt,  from

the  implements  in  the  boat,  that  it  was  the  intention  of  these  sealers  to  violate  our  law 
by  taking  seals  in  our  waters,  and  were  only  kept  from  so  doing  by  their  interception  and 
arrest  by  the  Cutter. 

The  Captain  informed  me  also  that  yesterday  Captain  Cantwell  in  overhauling  a  schooner 
had  to  fire  one  blank  and  one  solid  shot  in  her  direction  before  the  schooner  came  into  the 
wind. 


June  26,  1907 

All  hands  went  to  the  Point  in  the  afternoon.  The  Government  boat  was  taken  up  loaded 
with  coal  and  supplies  for  the  watchmen. 

Shortly  after  our  arrival  there  the  guard  reported  a  schooner  “close  in”  toward  Hutchinson 
Hill.  In  about  an  hour  the  entire  guard  came  armed  to  Webster  House,  stating  that  the 
schooner  was  standing  in  toward  the  rookery  and  was  very  close  to  shore.  Mr.  Judge  and 
I,  therefore,  with  the  guard,  ran  over  to  Hutchinson  Hill.  On  our  arrival  there,  we  saw  the 
schooner  standing  to  the  N.  E.  and  at  least  3  miles  off  shore.  The  guard  watched  her  until 
she  went  out  of  sight  on  her  course. 

June  28,  1907 

While  killing  seals  this  morning  at  the  Point  several  shots  were  heard  coming  out  of  the  fog 
from  the  water  in  the  direction  of  Sea  Lion  Neck. 

June  30,  1907 

At  11  o’clock  three  shots  were  heard  out  on  the  water  in  the  direction  of  Zapadni  Point, 
followed  by  three  more  at  11.27  and  four  more  at  11.40.  A  guard  was  summoned, 
provisioned  and  armed,  and  the  four  men  were  sent  to  Zapadni  rookery  by  boat,  with 
instructions  to  guard  that  rookery  from  invasion,  and  to  make  a  drive  of  seals  early 
tomorrow  morning,  when  the  sealing  gang  would  come  over. . . .  The  fog  is  thick,  and  the 
weather  calm. 

In  the  afternoon,  probably  40  shots  were  fired  off  Zapadni  Point.  Firing  was  heard  also  in 
English  Bay  to  the  N.W.  of  the  Milage.  In  the  evening,  cannon  shots  were  heard  to  the  S.W. 
of  the  village,  as  a  signal  for  the  small  boats  to  assemble.  The  fog  was  too  thick  to  make  out 
anything. . . . 

The  guard  at  North-East  Point  reports  that  they  heard  cannon  firing  in  that  vicinity  this 
afternoon. 

Incursions  into  the  three-mile  limit  would  continue  under  the  veil  of  fog.  Eventually, 
the  community  became  somewhat  complacent  as  recorded  by  the  agent. 

July  4,  1907 

The  presence  of  schooners  . . .  excites  little  or  no  comment,  so  long  as  the  vessels  are 
outside  the  3-mile  limit,  and  although  sealing  vessels  are  sighted  almost  daily  they  are  not 
always  reported  unless  sighted  from  the  village,  or  something  of  importance  occurs  in 
connection  therewith. 

On  August  13,  1907,  the  NACC  steamer  Homer  delivered  to  St.  Paul  Island  two  10- 
barrel,  30-caliber,  model  1897  Gatling  guns,  three  1.65  caliber  Hotchkiss  mountain  guns, 
twenty-five  30-caliber  Model  1898  rifles,  and  five  38-caliber  Colt  Model  1901  revolvers 
from  the  Rock  Island,  Illinois,  Arsenal.26  According  to  the  Agent’s  Log,  these  weapons 
were  brought  “for  the  protection  of  the  island,”2  presumably  against  potential  maraud¬ 
ing  sealers.  The  Agent’s  Log,  however,  revealed  that  this  weaponry  found  other  practical 
applications.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Men  with  cannons  (possibly  Hotchkiss  42 
mm  and  revolving  37  mm)  aimed  out  to  sea, 
with  several  men  holding  ramrods  for  load¬ 
ing  barrels.  These  weapons  were  meant  to 
protect  St.  Paul  Island  from  sealing  pirates, 
although  they  were  more  often  used  to  signal 
ships.  1912.  (NARA,  Pacific  Alaska  Region, 
Anchorage,  RG  22,  U.S.  Bureau  of  Fisheries, 
1907-1921.) 


Today  Chief  Merculif,  two  natives  and  I  mounted  and  cleaned  the  other  two  [Hotchkiss 
guns]  and  I  fired  a  blank  shell  from  each  of  the  three  guns.  The  mechanism  of  these  guns 
is  simple  they  are  easily  handled  and  without  doubt  very  effective  for  short  distances. 

The  rapidity  with  which  the  natives  followed  the  literature  available  on  the  subject  was 
gratifying.28 

Eight  men  and  I  spent  the  entire  day  cleaning  and  mounting  the  two  Gatling  guns  brought 
up  by  the  HOMER.  One  was  ready  for  business  shortly  before  noon.  We  took  it  to  the 
school  house  where  I  fired  about  30  shots.  One  of  the  shells  then  became  jammed  and  as 
we  were  not  thoroughly  familiar  with  the  mechanism  it  took  us  considerable  time  to  extract 
the  Shell.  We  then  tried  it  again,  and  the  gun  worked  beautifully.  About  50  shells  were 
fired  without  any  thing  going  wrong.  These  guns  are  superb  pieces  of  machinery,  which 
will  require  considerable  attention  to  keep  them  in  a  state  of  efficiency.  The  discharge  of  a 
[Gatling]  is  not  unlike  that  of  a  bunch  of  fire  crackers  but  of  course  much  louder. 

In  order  to  familiarize  the  natives  with  the  Hotchkiss  guns  the  three  empty  shells  on  hand 
were  re-primed  and  fired  from  the  shop  door  several  times.  The  Hotchkiss  guns  were  then 
cleaned  when  both  mountain  and  gatlings  were  covered  with  the  paulins  and  all  gear  that 
came  with  them.  The  reloading  of  the  Hotchkiss  shells  for  signaling  is  a  very  simple  matter. 

Lieut.  Stromberg  [of  the  Perry]  complimented  us  on  setting  up  the  guns,  especially  as 
neither  the  natives  nor  I,  had  ever  seen  a  Gatling,  and  not  a  scrap  of  literature  accompanied 
either  piece. 

All  work  on  the  guns  was  done  in  the  native  shop,  which  we  found  extremely  convient  [sic] 
and  without  which  we  would  have  been  seriously  handicapped,  as  the  Company  shop  was 
in  constant  use  by  the  Co  employees,  and  there  was  no  other  suitable  place  on  the  Island. 

While  the  shop  was  built  for  the  use  of  the  natives,  it  is  evident  that  the  Government  will 
be  a  large  user  of  it.29 

The  records  examined  did  not  indicate  that  the  Hotchkiss  and  Gatling  guns  ever  saw 
action  against  marauding  sealers,  but  sightings  of  schooners  continued  around  St.  Paul 
until  the  end  of  August  1907. 

On  June  25,  1913,  Agent  Lembkey  received  a  telegram  from  the  Secretary  of 
Commerce  notifying  him  “that  the  position  of  agent,  seal  fisheries,  was  abolished  by  law, 
to  take  effect  June  30  instant.”  On  July  1,  1913,  he  received  another  telegram  stating  that 
he  was  temporarily  appointed  special  assistant  agent-in-charge  until  Mr.  Chamberlain, 
the  naturalist  to  replace  Dr.  Walter  Hahn,  who  had  died  of  exposure  earlier  in  the  year,  ar-

rived  at  the  island  (see  the  biography  for  Walter  Hahn).  Mr.  Chamberlain  arrived  aboard 
the  Homer  on  July  14,  1913,  and  Lembkey  left  the  island.  Agent  Lembkey ’s  departure  from 
the  Seal  Islands  was  either  good  timing,  or  indirectly  responsible  for  one  of  the  most  in¬ 
famous  scandals  to  envelop  the  Pribilof  Islands  over  the  behavior  of  the  government  staff. 
The  next  year,  several  government  officials  were  charged  with  gross  misconduct.  Given 
that  Agent  Lembkey  had  conducted  himself  as  an  honorable  leader,  those  officials  who 
remained  behind  and  fell  into  disgrace  may  not  have  done  so  if  Lembkey  and  his  positive 
influence  had  remained  on  the  island.  Conversely,  Lembkey  might  have  been  caught  up  in 
the  scandal  by  association  (see  E.  Lester  Jones  and  Alvin  Whitney  biographies). 

The  1920  U.S.  Census  showed  that  Lembkey  had  returned  to  Washington,  D.C.,  after 
his  service  in  the  Pribilof  Islands.  He  worked  as  a  law  clerk  for  the  War  Department.

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

St.  George  Island  Assistant  Agent  Abial  Loud  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration 
on  April  15,  1892,  before  Notary  Public  Charles  L.  Hughes  at  Washington,  D.C.  Excerpts 
provide  the  dates  of  his  service  in  the  Pribilofs: 

I  am  a  resident  of  Hampden,  Me.,  and  am  55  years 
of  age.  On  April  4,  1885, 1  was  appointed  special 
assistant  Treasury  agent  for  the  seal  islands,  and 
immediately  started  for  the  islands,  arriving  at 
the  island  of  St.  Paul  on  May  28  or  30,  spent  that 
season  on  St.  Paul  Island,  and  returned  for  the 
winter  to  the  States,  leaving  the  islands  on  the  18th 
of  August.  Went  back  again  next  spring  arriving 
there  in  the  latter  part  of  May,  and  remained  until 
August,  1887. . . .  Spent  the  season  of  1888  and 
1889  on  St.  George  Island,  returning  in  the  fall  of 
1889  to  the  States.  In  1889  I  spent  some  time  in  the 
fall  on  St.  Paul  Island. 

In  July,  1887, 1  captured  the  sealing  schooner  Angel 
Dolly  while  she  was  hovering  about  the  islands. 

I  examined  the  seal  skins  she  had  on  board,  and 
about  80  percent  were  females. 

I  have  conversed  with  the  captains  of  several 
marauding  schooners,  and  others  who  were 
employed  in  pelagic  sealing  have  informed  me 
that  they  usually  use  rifles  in  shooting  seals  in  the 
water.  Some,  however,  use  shotguns,  but  to  no  great 
extent.  From  these  conversations  I  should  judge 
they  did  not  secure  more  than  one-half  of  the  seals 
killed.30

Genealogy 

Frederic  Augustus  Lucas  was  born  March  25,  1852,  at  Plymouth,  Massachusetts,  the  son 
of  Augustus  H.  Lucas,  a  clipper  ship  captain,  and  Elizabeth  O.  (Sylvester)  Lucas.  Frederic 
Lucas  married  Annie  J.  Edgar  on  February  13,  1884.31  Frederic  Lucas  died  on  February  9, 
1929,  in  Flushing,  New  York.32 

Biographical  Sketch 

“On  one  of  several  long  voyages  with  his  father,  [Frederic]  . . .  met  a  man  who  influenced 
the  whole  course  of  his  life.  This  was  Professor  Ward  of  Rochester,  who  took  young  Lucas 
into  his  Natural  Science  Establishment  at  Rochester.  He  studied  taxidermy,  osteology, 
geology  and  comparative  anatomy  from  1871  until  his  appointment,  eleven  years  later, 
as  osteologist  of  the  United  States  National  Museum  in  Washington.”33  Lucas  joined  the 
Smithsonian  Institution  in  1882  as  an  “osteological  preparatory”  (a  scientist  who  prepares 
bones  for  further  study  or  examination).  He  became  assistant  curator  of  the  Division 
of  Comparative  Anatomy  at  the  U.S.  National  Museum  in  1887-98  and  served  as  cura-

tor  from  1898  to  1904.  He  remained  at  the  Smithsonian  for  twenty-two  years  and  then 
became  curator-in-chief  of  the  Brooklyn  Institute  of  Arts  and  Sciences.34  From  the  New 
York  Times  obituary  for  Dr.  Frederic  Lucas  on  February  10,  1920: 

In  1904  Dr.  Lucas  came  to  Brooklyn  as  curator-in-chief  of  the  museums  of  the  Brooklyn 
Institute  of  Arts  and  Sciences.  In  May,  1911,  he  was  appointed  director  of  the  American 
Museum  of  Natural  History  to  succeed  Dr.  Hermon  C.  Bumpus.  Among  the  authorities 
who  endorsed  his  selection  were  Dr.  William  T.  Hornaday,  Director  of  the  Bronx  Zoological 
Gardens,  and  Charles  H.  Townsend,  director  of  the  Aquarium,  both  of  whom  had  worked 
with  Dr.  Lucas  thirty-five  years  before  at  Professor  Ward’s  in  Rochester.

Lutz,  John  Edwin  (1857-1937) 

Lieutenant,  Revenue  Marine,  Pribilof  Islands  Guard,  1884 
Genealogy 

John  Edwin  Lutz  was  born  in  October  1857  at  Circleville,  Pickaway  County,  Ohio,  one  of 
three  sons  of  lawyer  John  A.  Lutz  and  Mary  H.  (Humphreys)  Lutz.  John  Lutz’s  brothers, 
also  born  in  Circleville,  were  Harry  E.  Lutz,  born  September  18,  1860,  and  Samuel  J.  Lutz, 
born  in  1867. 

John  Edwin  Lutz  married  twice,  first  in  1896  to  Nellie  R.  Miller,  born  September 
1865,  daughter  of  Oakland,  California,  banker  William  E.  and  Augusta  Miller.  John  and 
Nellie  Lutz  had  two  daughters:  Winifred  A.  Lutz,  born  November  1898,  and  Eulila  E.  Lutz, 
born  June  1899,  both  in  Oakland.  Nellie  R.  Miller  Lutz  died  in  Oakland  on  November  25, 
1904.  John  Lutz  married  again  in  1906  at  Oakland  to  Ruby  Smith,  born  June  20,  1878, 
in  California,  and  died  June  18,  1956,  in  Napa,  California.  No  children  were  born  of  this 
second  marriage.  John  Edwin  Lutz  died  in  Los  Angeles,  California,  on  February  15,  1937, 
and  is  buried  at  the  Los  Angeles  National  Cemetery.37 

Biographical  Sketch 

At  age  eighteen,  John  Edwin  Lutz  passed  rigorous  entrance  exams  and  entered  the  Revenue 
Cutter  School  of  Instruction,  which  later  became  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  Academy.  In  June 
1881,  he  was  one  of  ten  cadets  to  graduate  since  the  school  had  opened  in  1877.  After 
graduation,  he  became  a  third  lieutenant  in  the  Revenue  Marine  Service  and  was  stationed 
out  of  San  Francisco.  He  soon  commanded  revenue  cutters  in  Alaskan  waters  and  on 
Puget  Sound  in  Washington  state.38  Among  other  things,  Lutz  was  involved  in  land  ven- 


406 


Biographies  L  ♦  Lucas  -  Lutz 


tures  such  as  building  the  Union  Pacific  railroad  terminus  at  Port  Crescent,  Washington, 
and  the  operation  of  a  car  ferry  to  Victoria,  British  Columbia.39 

John  Lutz  settled  in  Oakland,  California,  in  1896,  after  his  first  marriage.  The  1900 
and  1910  U.S.  Censuses  recorded  John  E.  Lutz  as  a  “miner,  copper  mine  operator.”  He  had 
interests  in  the  gold  and  copper  mines  in  the  Yerington  District  and  Buckskin  Range  of 
Nevada,  which  had  reported  making  a  rich  strike  in  1906.  By  the  1920  U.S.  Census,  Lutz 
had  re-joined  the  Navy  as  a  first  lieutenant.40 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Third  Lieutenant  John  E.  Lutz  served  under  Captain  Michael  A.  Healy,  U.S.  Revenue 
Marine,  aboard  the  steamer  USS  Corwin.  In  1884,  he  was  detailed  to  the  Pribilof  Islands 
and  specifically  to  Otter  Island  to  protect  the  fur  seals  against  raids  by  pirates.  In  an 
ancillary  capacity,  he  received  orders  to  collect  bird  specimens  at  Otter  Island  for  the 
Smithsonian  Institution’s  collection.  His  observations  of  bird  behavior  resulted  in  inter¬ 
esting  commentaries  about  several  species — from  nest  building  and  rebuilding  to  egg 
laying  to  notes  on  fledglings.41 

Lutz’s  report  for  the  period  June  1  to  September  29,  1884,  recommended  monitoring 
Otter  Island  from  St.  Paul  Island:42 

A  comparatively  small  number  of  seals  visited  Otter  Island  this  season.  While  the  necessity 
of  this  detail  for  the  protection  of  Otter  Island  and  St.  Paul  Island  are  self-evident,  I  would 
respectfully  suggest  that  the  officer  sent  there  could  perform  that  duty  better  if  stationed 
on  the  latter  island  instead  of  the  former.  He  should,  of  course,  be  instructed  to  visit  Otter 
Island  whenever  practicable,  as  well  as  the  more  remote  portions  of  St.  Paul  Island,  in 
order  to  observe  any  possible  depredations.  Marauders  are  not  so  likely  to  attempt  to  take 
seal  from  Otter  Island,  which  is  so  well  protected  by  rocks  and  heavy  surf,  as  they  are  to 
visit  the  northern  part  of  St.  Paul  Island,  where  a  fine  sandy  beach  extends  for  miles  on 
either  side  of  the  island,  and  seals  are  to  be  found  in  great  abundance.  With  the  small  boat 
provided  for  use  on  Otter  Island,  and  a  crew  of  only  two  men,  it  would  be  impossible, 
usually,  to  board  and  seize  any  vessel  which  might  be  detected  in  the  attempt  to  kill  seals. 

I  would  respectfully  urge  the  necessity  of  having  a  small  boat  howitzer  provided  for  the 
officer  detailed  for  duty  at  that  place.  With  that,  and  a  large  boat  and  crew  which  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company  would  be  willing  to  furnish  whenever  desired,  one  officer  stationed 
on  the  island  of  St.  Paul  could  protect  it  and  the  adjacent  waters  from  the  depredations  of 
marauding  vessels,  and  would  also  be  able  to  take  by  force  any  vessel  found  violating  the 
law.43 

On  August  20,  1884,  after  having  been  stationed  on  Otter  Island  since  June  10, 44 
Lieutenant  Lutz  and  his  two-man  detail  departed  for  St.  Paul  Island.45  On  August  29, 
a  schooner  was  observed  southwest  of  St.  Paul  Island.  Nothing  came  of  the  sighting. 
Then  in  the  afternoon  of  August  30,  another  schooner  traveled  along  the  western  shore 
of  St.  Paul  Island.  Lutz  surmised  from  the  vessel’s  behavior  that  it  intended  to  take  seals 
on  St.  Paul’s  north  shore.  A  patrol  composed  of  Lutz  and  his  two  men,  six  Aleuts,  and  a 
volunteer  from  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  (ACC)  rowed  about  twenty  miles  to 
Northeast  Point  in  a  whaleboat  furnished  by  the  ACC.  There  the  crew  linked  up  with  the 
Aleut  watchman.  On  the  31st,  Lutz  monitored  the  vessel,  which  lay  to  twenty  miles  off¬ 
shore.  By  noon  the  inevitable  fog  obscured  the  vessel.  Because  the  schooner  lay  to  “in  the 
middle  of  the  Bering  Sea,”  Lutz  could  only  assume  that  the  crew  intended  to  come  ashore 


407 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


for  seals.  At  12:30  a.m.  on  September  first  the  vessel  came  within  a  mile  of  shore  on  the 
eastern  side  of  Northeast  Point.  Lutz  immediately  launched  the  whaleboat.  After  a  mile- 
and-a-half  row,  the  crew  reached  the  anchored  vessel  around  1:00  a.m.46 

I  boarded  her  with  my  men  and  found  the  master  of  the  vessel  on  board.  Upon  being 
questioned,  he  freely  admitted  that  he  was  there  for  the  purpose  of  sealing,  and  that  his 
boats  had  been  sent  ashore  to  make  a  catch.  I  then  waited  for  the  return  of  the  boats. 

During  the  wait  for  the  sealers’  return,  “The  master  . . .  pleaded  to  be  released,  making 
various  excuses,  and  saying  that  I  would  ‘lose  nothing’  if  I  would  let  the  vessel  go.”4 
Eventually  three  boats  returned  to  the  schooner.  The  crew  disposed  of  many  of  the  seals 
overboard  in  an  initial  attempt  to  escape,  but  in  the  end  they  surrendered  with  twenty- 
one  seal  carcasses.  Thereupon,  Lieutenant  Lutz  notified  Master  Gustave  Isaacson  that  he 
was  seizing  the  schooner  Adele  of  Hamburg,  Germany. 48 

The  Adele,  built  at  Shanghai  in  1877  as  a  pilot  boat,  measured  fifty  British  tons.  It  was 
known  as  “The  Flying  Dutchman”  because  of  its  daring  raids  on  sealing  grounds  under 
various  masters.49  Isaacson  had  sailed  the  Adele  from  Yokohama,  Japan,  on  April  9,  1877, 
with  three  white  officers  and  eighteen  Japanese  crew.  Two  other  white  men  were  aboard 
but  not  listed  on  the  manifest;  the  captain  claimed  they  were  passengers.  However,  these 
passengers  had  accompanied  the  poachers  ashore  and  by  association  participated  in  the 
poaching.  Unbeknownst  to  Lutz,50  the  two  had  joined  the  Adele  after  leaving  the  crew  of 
the  Nemo,  which  following  its  purchase  in  1884  from  the  Russians  by  adventurer,  sea  otter 
hunter,  and  author  H.  J.  Snow,  had  been  sent  to  the  Pribilofs.51  The  Adele’s  papers  demon¬ 
strated  she  was  cleared  “for  a  hunting  voyage  to  the  North  Pacific,  the  Kurile  Islands,  and 
return.  She  was  therefore  out  of  the  waters  for  which  she  cleared,  in  addition  to  which 
she  had  no  name  painted  on  the  stern.”52  The  skins  already  on  board  included  those  of  217 
seal,  ten  sea  otter,  eighteen  sea  lion,  and  thirteen  fox. 

I  had  now  six  white  men  to  contend  with,  and  some  of  them  were  outspoken  in  their 
determination  not  to  be  arrested.  They  were  beginning  to  arouse  a  spirit  of  resistance 
in  the  captain  also,  when  I  called  him  aside,  formally  notified  him  that  I  had  seized  his 
vessel  in  behalf  of  the  Government  of  the  United  States,  warned  him  against  resistance 
and  demanded  the  vessel’s  papers. . . .  One  of  the  passengers,  Sullivan  by  name,  was  more 
disposed  to  resist  arrest  than  any  of  the  others,  saying  that  all  he  possessed  “was  in  the 
vessel.”  As  I  could  not  hope  to  keep  six  well-armed  men  under  restraint  with  my  small 
force,  and  as  the  vessel  did  not  afford  any  safe  place  for  confinement,  I  deemed  it  necessary 
to  send  them  ashore  to  be  kept  there  until . . .  the  arrival  of  the  [cutter]  Corwin  A 

After  daylight,  they  sailed  the  Adele  to  the  village. 

Soon  after  our  arrival  at  the  village,  word  was  received  by  telephone  from  Northeast  Point 
that  a  schooner  was  there  engaged  in  the  capture  of  seals,  and  that  another  vessel  was 
approaching  from  the  northward.  It  was  necessary  to  drive  off  these  marauders  as  soon  as 
possible,  so  I  procured  a  fresh  crew  of  natives  and  started  forthwith.54 

Lieutenant  Lutz  commandeered  the  Adele  for  the  return  to  Northeast  Point,  where 
he  intended  to  “give  chase”  to  the  other  pirates.55 

Upon  reaching  Northeast  Point  I  saw  one  schooner  lying  at  anchor,  about  six  miles  off¬ 
shore,  her  people  being  then  engaged  probably  in  skinning  the  seals  taken  from  the  beach. 

As  soon  as  I  stood  off  in  her  direction  she  got  under  way  for  the  northward.  Then  she  stood 
off  and  on,  making  signals  by  dipping  the  peak  of  her  mainsail,  from  which,  as  well  as  from 
a  chance  remark  made  by  one  of  the  officers  of  the  Adele,  I  inferred  that  these  vessels  had

been  acting  in  concert.  Finally  she  hove  to  when  nine  or  ten  miles  off-shore  and  waited  for 
me.  It  was  dusk  when  I  drew  near  her  and  her  people  could  not  distinguish  the  revenue 
Hag  until  I  was  within  one  hundred  yards  of  her.  I  then  observed  that  the  vessel’s  name  had 
been  painted  out.  She  immediately  filled  [sic]  away  and  made  all  sail.  I  caused  two  shots 
to  be  fired  across  her  bow  and  two  into  the  upper  part  of  her  rigging,  hailing  her  people 
after  every  shot  and  repeating  the  order  for  them  to  heave-to.  Muttered  imprecations  were 
the  only  reply  until  after  the  fourth  shot,  when  they  fired  into  us.  I  then  directed  my  men 
to  aim  lower,  so  as  to  rake  the  decks  of  the  other  vessel.  I  stopped  fire  at  intervals  to  see 
if  she  would  heave-to.  She  fired  five  or  six  shots  into  us,  which  we  returned  with  fifty  or 
sixty  rounds.  We  suffered  no  damage,  and  they  probably  received  little  or  no  injury,  as  they 
were  all  under  cover.  Darkness  had  set  in,  the  wind  freshened,  and  I  finally  abandoned  the 
chase.56 

Lutz  returned  to  the  village  to  prepare  for  his  voyage  aboard  th e  Adele  to  San  Francisco, 
where  the  crew  would  be  prosecuted  for  the  illegal  taking  of  fur  seals.  During  the  day  of 
September  2,  three  more  vessels  were  sighted  off  Northeast  Point,  but  he  decided  that  “as 
the  authorities  had  now  been  given  sufficient  time  for  equipping  and  sending  out  armed 
parties  to  protect  different  portions  of  the  island,  I  considered  it  unnecessary  for  me  to 
remain”57 

Lieutenant  Lutz  eventually  reached  San  Francisco  with  the  Adele  and  her  crew, 
except  for  nine  of  the  Japanese  who  were  left  on  St.  Paul  Island  to  be  brought  south  by 
the  Corwin.  After  some  delay,  the  white  men  were  arrested  at  San  Francisco  and  the  nine 
other  Japanese  held  as  witnesses.  In  the  end  all  the  Japanese  were  released,  including 
those  left  on  St.  Paul,  and  the  vessel  returned  to  its  owner  in  Yokohama.58  The  officers  of 
the  Adele  pleaded  guilty  and  were  sentenced  to  four  months  imprisonment.59 

In  1885,  Special  Agent  George  R.  Tingle  recorded  the  following  epilogue  to  th eAdele’s 
seizure  and  the  consequent  fate  of  Lieutenant  John  E.  Lutz: 

On  Sunday,  the  12th  of  July,  while  the  lessees’  steamer  Dora,  was  on  her  course  from  St. 

Michaels,  via  St.  Paul,  to  Unalaska,  she  sighted  a  schooner  about  15  miles  from  St.  Paul, 
and  under  orders  from  me  to  go  alongside  of  any  suspicious  craft  he  might  fall  in  with,  he 
stood  for  the  schooner  with  full  steam  and  sail.  When  close  enough  to  see  with  his  glass, 
he  discovered  her  crew  (about  20  men)  very  busy  on  deck.  He  could  not  tell  whether  they 
were  throwing  cargo  overboard,  or  disposing  of  it  otherwise.  The  men  all  disappeared  on 
the  nearer  approach  of  the  steamer,  which  was  not  long  coming  alongside  of  the  schooner, 
whose  name  was  painted  out.  The  captain,  when  asked  by  Captain  Hogue  of  the  steamer 
Dora,  said  he  was  from  Victoria,  and  gave  the  name  of  his  vessel  as  the  Adele,  but  Captain 
Hogue  recognized  her  as  the  same  piratical  schooner  captured  here  last  fall  by  Lieutenant 
Lutz,  of  the  revenue  marine,  with  her  crew  ashore  killing  seals  on  the  rookery,  and  loading 
them  in  their  boats.  She  was  taken  to  San  Francisco  by  Lieutenant  Lutz,  who  landed 
her  safely  and  delivered  her  to  the  authorities.  The  voyage  from  here  in  her  was  a  very 
dangerous  one,  and  the  exposure  to  which  Lieutenant  Lutz  was  subjected  so  prostrated  him 
and  shattered  his  health  that  he  is  still  an  invalid.  The  authorities  released  the  vessel,  and 
set  all  hands  free;  and  the  Government  relieved  Lieutenant  Lutz  of  his  commission.  This 
is  the  reward  of  an  officer  in  the  faithful  discharge  of  his  duty.  The  captain  of  the  steamer 
Dora,  not  having  any  authority  to  board  her,  had  to  let  her  go  to  ply  her  unlawful  avocation. 

The  captain  of  the  schooner  acknowledged  that  he  thought  the  Dora  was  the  revenue 
cutter  Corwin  when  she  started  for  him,  as  they  are  very  similar  vessels.  The  presence  of 
this  marauder  the  next  season  after  being  captured  and  released,  shows  the  boldness  of  her 
captain  and  his  disregard  for  the  laws.60 

We  did  not  find  any  information  to  corroborate  Tingle’s  story  as  to  the  lieutenant’s 

fate.

Macoun,  James  Melville  (1862-1920) 

Chief  Naturalist,  Biological  Division,  Geological  Survey  of  Canada 
Pribilof  Islands  Fur  Seal  and  Plant  Specialist,  1891-1920 

Genealogy 

James  Melville  Macoun  was  born  on  November  7, 

1862,  in  Belleville,  Ontario,  Canada,  to  the  “Dean 
of  Canadian  Naturalists,”  John  Macoun,  and 
his  wife,  Ellen  (Terrill)  Macoun.1  On  January  3, 

1889,  James  Macoun  married  Mary  MacLennan, 
born  at  Whitby,  Ontario,  circa  1863,  the  daugh¬ 
ter  of  Kenneth  and  Margret  Douglas  (Ireland) 

MacLennan.2  James  Macoun  died  at  the  age  of  fif¬ 
ty-eight  on  January  8,  1920,  in  Ottawa,  Canada.3 


Biographical  Sketch 

“The  Macoun  name  is  connected  with  practi¬ 
cally  all  the  botanical  research  work  of  Canada, 
and  many  of  the  plant  species  of  Canada  bear 
the  name  of  Macoun.”4  James  Macoun  graduated  James  Macoun_  (Jheo_  Hoim>  «James  M 
from  Belleville  High  School  and  earned  a  degree  Macoun’,’ 240.) 

in  botany  from  Albert  College,  Belleville,  Ontario,  Canada.  In  1883,  he  became  his  fa¬ 
ther’s  assistant  at  the  Canadian  Geological  Survey.5  The  two  collected  many  specimens 
of  Canadian  and  Pribilof  Islands  flora  and  wrote  numerous  botanical  books.  Their  speci¬ 
mens  were  added  to  Canada’s  National  Herbarium  of  the  Geological  Survey.6

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

James  Macoun’s  reputation  as  a  first-rate  biologist  led  to  his  selection  as  Canada’s  natural 
history  expert  during  Great  Britain’s  appeal  to  the  Paris  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  for  the 
resolution  of  claims  by  the  United  States  that  it  had  sole  authority  over  the  Bering  Sea  and 
the  northern  fur  seal  east  of  longitude  180  degrees.  James  Macoun’s  biographer,  Harlan 
Smith,  wrote: 

In  1891,  when  the  fur-seal  industry  of  the  Pacific  Islands  was  a  subject  of  diplomatic 
concern  between  Great  Britain,  Canada,  and  the  United  States,  he  was  chosen  by  Dr. 

George  M.  Dawson,  then  director  of  the  Geological  Survey  and  Behring  Sea  Commissioner 
for  Canada,  to  accompany  him  on  a  trip  of  investigation  to  Behring  Sea.  His  services  in  the 
study  of  the  life  history  and  habits  of  the  fur  seal  were  so  valuable  that  he  was  retained  on 
this  work  in  1892  and  1893,  and  was  sent  to  Europe  as  an  expert  in  connection  with  the 
fur-seal  arbitration." 

The  British  believed  they  received  an  honorable  resolution  of  their  claims  before  the 
Tribunal  of  Arbitration. 

[James  Macoun],  the  Canadian  sealing  expert,  thinks  the  most  important  points  settled  by 
the  agreement  of  the  experts  at  Washington  acquit  Canada  of  all  wrong.  The  experts  agree, 
he  says,  that  pelagic  sealing  is  conducted  according  to  the  rules  under  the  Paris  award,  and 
that  so  long  as  the  haunts  of  the  seals  on  land  are  protected,  and  the  protected  zone  at  sea 
is  maintained,  the  seals  are  in  no  danger  of  actual  extermination.8 

Despite  that  positive  assessment,  Great  Britain  agreed  with  the  United  States  that 
additional  scientific  investigation  was  warranted  to  ascertain  the  truth  on  the  contin¬ 
ued  decline  of  the  fur-seal  population.  Consequently,  Macoun  was  enlisted  to  represent 
Great  Britain  and  Canada  on  the  1896-97  Bering  Sea  Fur-Seal  Commission;  he  also  par¬ 
ticipated  in  further  scientific  investigations  headed  by  Commissioner  David  Starr  Jordan. 
In  1914,  Macoun  was  appointed  by  the  British  government  to  join  another  American 
team  of  scientists  including  Wilfred  Osgood,  Edward  Preble  and  George  Parker,  whose 
mission,  in  large  part,  was  to  ascertain  the  Pribilof  seal-herd  demographics  (see  Wilfred 
Osgood  biography).  Pribilof  Islands  schoolteacher  and  naturalist  G  Dallas  Hanna  made 
the  acquaintance  of  Macoun  during  that  time.  Hanna  affectionately  wrote,  “Macoun  was 
here  [St.  Paul  Is.]  in  1913  [1914].  He  didn’t  get  out  very  much.  He  was  an  old  man  in  1913 

[1914 — at  52  years  of  age].  He  went 
down  to  see  the  [Doctor]  one  day  and 
said,  ‘Doctor,  my  foot  hurts.  I  wish 
you’d  tell  me  what’s  the  matter  with 
my  foot.’  The  Dr.  said,  ‘Well,  if  you’d 
change  shoes  and  put  the  left  one  on

very  celebrated  in  Canadian  natural 
history,  but  he  was  not  in  very  good 
physical  condition.”9

Biographies  M  ♦  Macoun 


Macouns  participation  did  not  appear  to  lead  to  a  report  about  his  findings.  Eminent 
lur-seal  expert  Dr.  Victor  Scheffer  commented  in  this  regard,  “We  find  no  record  of  a  pub¬ 
lished  report. 10  Regardless,  James  Macoun’s  scientific  contributions  at  the  Seal  Islands 
made  him  the  recognized  Canadian  seal  expert. 

In  1896  and  in  1914  he  was  again  sent  to  the  Behring  Sea.  In  1911  [James  Macoun]  spent  10 
weeks  in  Washington  as  one  of  the  Canadian  representatives  at  the  fur-seal  conference.  For 
his  special  international  work  in  connection  with  the  fur-seal  he  was  highly  commended 
by  Lord  Bryce,  then  British  Ambassador  at  Washington,  and  received  a  C.M.G.  for  his 
services.11 

While  Macouns  charge  was  to  study  the  fur  seal,  given  his  background  he  naturally 
became  more  interested  in  the  plants  of  the  Pribilof  Islands  than  counting  seals.  He  au¬ 
thored  papers  on  mosses  and  plant  identification.  Part  3  of  the  Fur-Seal  Commission’s 
report  (David  Starr  Jordan,  editor,  The  Fur  Seals  and  Fur-Seal  Islands  of  the  North  Pacific 
Ocean,  U.S.  Dept  of  the  Treasury,  Doc.  2017,  Washington,  DC:  GPO.)  contained  Macoun’s 
report  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  flora.12  Macoun  wrote  later,  “The  Pribylov  Islands  are  not  so 
barren  and  bleak  as  they  are  generally  supposed  to  be.  Except  where  the  rocks  have  not 
yet  been  covered  with  soil  the  ground  is  everywhere  hidden  by  a  luxuriant  growth  of  grass 
interspersed  with  beautiful  flowers.  Though  the  hours  of  sunshine  are  few  in  summer  this 
does  not  affect  the  coloring  of  the  blossoms,  for  I  have  nowhere  seen  deeper,  richer  colors 
than  are  exhibited  by  the  flowers  growing  on  the  Pribylov  Islands.”13 

Whether  Macoun’s  interpretations  about  the  cause  of  the  seal  herd’s  decline  were 
influenced  by  his  country’s  strong  desire  to  support  its  case  for  limiting  harvesting  and 
sustaining  pelagic  sealing  is  unclear  to  these  authors.  Certainly  the  historical  record  re¬ 
veals  Canada’s  predilection  for  its  fishers  working  out  of  British  Columbia.  The  following 
example  of  seeming  bias  by  Macoun  appeared  in  an  independently  published  account 
(i.e.,  outside  the  Fur-Seal  Commission’s  report)  of  his  interpretations. 

Some  pups  undoubtedly  die  of  starvation,  but  the  number  is  small  and  even  when  the 
mother  is  killed  before  the  young  one  can  procure  food  from  the  sea  it  not  infrequently 
secures  nourishment  from  other  females.  Several  such  cases  have  been  noted  by  me.14 

This  account  suggests  that  Macoun’s  powers  of  observation  regarding  seal  biology 
were  poor,  although  the  same  cannot  be  said  regarding  his  botanical  observations.  The 
female  northern  fur  seal  is  not  known  to  feed  other  than  its  own  pup,  and  as  seen  in  the 
accompanying  photograph,  many  dead  seal  pups  littered  the  beaches.  However,  Macoun’s 
other  writings  offer  interesting  perspectives  about  human  life  on  the  Bering  Sea  during 
those  times. 

The  native  seal-killer  on  the  islands  ...  is  concerned  only  with  the  work  of  killing  the 
seals  and  the  consequent  feasting  such  an  ample  supply  of  fresh  meat  affords  him.  While 
the  men  are  busy  clubbing  and  skinning  the  seals,  the  women  and  children  are  employed 
in  cutting  off  the  best  parts  of  the  carcase  for  use  as  food.  All  parts  of  the  seal  are  eaten, 
tongue,  heart  and  liver,  as  well  as  the  solid  flesh.  A  part  of  what  is  not  consumed  during 
the  summer  is  dried  for  winter  use,  though  the  process  is  a  long  one  on  account  of  the 
prevailing  foggy  or  wet  weather,  and  the  drying  meat  is  unsavoury  to  a  white  man,  both  in 
appearance  and  odour.  At  the  table  of  the  sealing  company  such  meat  is  served  in  some 
form  at  every  meal.  As  dressed  by  cooks  of  experience  it  is  very  palatable,  though  rather 
gamy  in  flavour.  The  liver,  is  particularly  good,  at  least  those  who  are  fond  of  liver  say  so.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


The  life  of  the  pelagic  seal  hunters  is  in  every  respect  a  hard  one.  On  board  the  schooner  his 
quarters  are  crowded  and  his  fare  often  poor.  He  is  allowed  to  remain  on  board  in  the  very 
roughest  weather,  any  day  on  which  the  boats  may  be  lowered  with  safety  being  considered 

a  suitable  one  for  hunting _ Often  in  the  North  Pacific,  and  nearly  always  in  Behring  Sea, 

the  fog  is  so  dense  that  the  vessel  can  be  distinguished  only  a  few  yards  away,  but  these 
hardy,  adventurous  men,  taking  their  lives  in  their  hands,  set  out  to  look  for  seals  with  the 
same  unconcern  as  if  the  day  were  clear.15

film  scripts  for  the  Department  of  Defense.  In  1920,  while  stationed  at  Camp  Hancock  in 
Augusta,  Georgia,  he  met  and  married  Agnes  Sharp  Flythe.  A  prolific  author,  Marshall 
published  at  least  one  novel  per  year  from  1920  until  his  death  in  1967.26 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Edison  Marshall  was  an  internationally  acclaimed  American  adventure  novelist  when  he 
arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  on  August  4,  1926,  aboard  the  U.S.  naval  vessel  USS  Vega.2'  He 
was  traveling  the  Seal  Islands  and  other  parts  of  Alaska  to  gather  information  for  a  new 
book.  On  St.  Paul  Island  he  spent  ten  days  watching  the  assembly  of  seals  and  collecting 
information  for  his  next  adventure  novel,  The  Far  Call.  The  1927  publication  was  an  over¬ 
night  success.  The  dust  jacket  of  the  1928  edition  proclaimed: 

Edison  Marshall’s  growing  public  will  find  him  in  THE  FAR  CALL  surpassing  any  of  his 
earlier  efforts  and  bidding  for  the  title  of  one  of  the  foremost  adventure  writers  of  today 
with  a  voice  that  cannot  be  denied.  Here  is  the  reckless  and  bloody  story  of  a  polyglot  gang 
of  seamen  who  set  out  in  these  modern  days  to  perform  the  greatest  act  of  piracy  since 
the  time  of  Captain  Kidd.  Here  is  the  old  lure  of  strong  men  grappling  each  other;  here  is 
barricade-fighting,  thundering  sea  and  wickedness  contrasted  with  the  beauty  of  woman 
and  the  courageous  tenderness  of  love.  Marshall  knows  his  men,  his  women,  his  settings. 

Let  his  gifted  pen  shang-hai  you  to  the  north  oceans.28 

Hollywood  loved  the  story,  and  Walter 
Woods  adapted  the  book  for  the  screen.  Two 
years  later,  director  Allan  Dwan  and  Fox  Studios 
brought  Marshall’s  story  to  life.  A  “CINEMA 
FLASH”  in  the  March  24,  1929,  edition  of  the 
New  York  Times  noted,  “Allan  Dwan  has  com¬ 
pleted  ‘The  Far  Call’  featuring  Charles  Morton 
and  Leila  Hyams  about  the  piratical  raiding 
on  the  seal  preserves  of  the  Pribilof  Islands.”29 
Other  actors  of  note  included  Bernard  Siegel 
as  “Aleut  Chief”  and  Randolph  Scott  in  his  first 
credited  movie  role,  in  the  part  of  villain/hero 
“Helms.”30 

The  Department  of  Commerce  granted 
Fox  Studios  permission  to  film  on  the  Pribilof 
Islands  during  the  1925  sealing  season.  The  St. 
Paul  Island  agent  recorded: 

Senator  Clarence  C.  Dill,  accompanied  by  his  secretary  Mr.  Frank  T.  Bell  and  motion 
picture  man  Mr.  Merl  LaVoy  were  brought  ashore  from  the  USCGC  Haida.  The  latter 
(LaVoy)  carried  permit  No.  151  signed  by  Acting  Secretary  of  Commerce  L.  Walter 
Drake.  The  party  was  escorted  to  Observation  Rock  and  afterward  to  Lukanin.  Mr.  LaVoy, 
motion  picture  man  for  Fox  Film  Company,  took  pictures  of  seal  life  at  both  Gorbatch  and 
Lukanin.31 

Marshall’s  other  books  served  as  the  basis  for  five  silent  movies  and  five  sound  films, 
including  the  1958  epic  The  Vikings.

Genealogy 

George  Marston  was  born  in  Sandown,  New 
Hampshire,  on  January  7,  1825,  the  son  of  wheel¬ 
wright  Amos  Marston  and  Susan  (Flanders) 

Marston.  George  married  Henrietta  A.  Clark, 
also  of  Sandown,  in  1846.  George  and  Henrietta 
Marston  had  three  children:  Henrietta  E.  Marston, 
born  June  12,  1847,  at  Sandown;  Andrew  Jackson 
Marston,  born  October  1,  1850,  at  Portsmouth, 

New  Hampshire;  and  Annie  Susan  Marston, 
born  March  1853,  in  New  Hampshire.  Henrietta 
Marston  died  June  30,  1861;  George  Marston 
died  August  16,  1888,  at  San  Diego,  California,32 
and  he  was  interred  at  the  Mt.  Hope  Cemetery  in 
San  Diego. 

Biographical  Sketch 

George  Marston  was  a  businessman,  politician,  newspaperman,  and  community  leader. 
He  had  a  farm  situated  on  the  town  line  of  Sandown  and  Hampstead,  New  Hampshire, 
but  his  business  and  political  life  often  took  him  elsewhere.  As  a  newlywed  in  the  1850s, 
Marston  ran  a  grocery  store  in  Portsmouth,  New  Hampshire,  and  “took  quite  a  promi¬ 
nent  part  in  politics  during  the  administration  of  President  [Franklin]  Pierce  [1853-1857] 
and  occupied  a  government  position  in  the  treasury  department  at  Washington.”33 

George  was  undoubtedly  influenced  by  his  uncle  Gilman  Marston  (1811-1890)  to 
become  involved  with  the  political  scene.  Gilman  had  earned  a  law  degree  from  Harvard 
in  1840  and  maintained  a  law  practice  in  Exeter,  New  Hampshire.  A  Republican,  he  was 
elected  New  Hampshire’s  representative  and  senator  to  the  36th  and  37th  Congress,  re¬ 
spectively,  from  1859-1863.  With  his  uncle’s  encouragement,  George  Marston  became 
“Doorkeeper”  to  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives  on  February  6,  1860,  a  position  he 
held  for  two  years.34  During  the  Civil  War  years,  George  was  a  paymaster  for  the  Army. 
Afterward  he  accepted  a  two-year  government  appointment  as  Superintendent  of  Internal 
Revenue.  In  1868,  he  entered  into  a  business  venture  as  part  owner  of  the  Portsmouth 
Chronicle  in  New  Hampshire. 

Following  Marston’s  tour  at  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  the  later  1870s,  he  returned  to  his 
farm  in  New  Hampshire  where  he  lived  until  moving  to  San  Diego,  California,  ten  years 
later.35

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Assistant  Special  Agent  George  Marston 
arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  on  June  27, 
1875.36  In  the  Agent’s  Log,  Marston  ex¬ 
pressed  his  discomfort  at  being  left  in 
charge  following  the  departure  of  Agent 
Charles  Bryant  on  August  6, 1875,  aboard 
the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  (ACC) 
steamer  Alexander .37  Nonetheless, 

Marston’s  entries  suggested  that  he  was 
an  honorable  man  and  readily  accepted 
his  responsibilities  to  oversee  the  welfare 
of  the  Natives  and  the  business  practices 
of  the  government’s  lessee,  the  ACC. 

September  24,  1875 

A  deputation  of  the  natives  called  upon 
Asst.  Treas.  Agt.  Marston,  and  expressed 
a  desire  to  have  the  1st  chief  Bootrin  displaced,  and  the  2nd  chief  Artimonoff  appointed 
in  his  stead.  They  stated  that  Bootrin  was  not  their  choice;  that  he  is  intemperate  and 
has  other  faults,  which,  in  their  opinion  disqualifies  him  for  the  position.  Their  charging 
Bootrin  with  intemperance  is  hardly  consistent,  for  they  all  drink  and  Artimonoff  was 
himself  very  drunk  on  the  21st  inst.38  There  seems  to  be  two  parties  in  the  village,  the 
strongest  of  which  is  the  church  party,  and  it  is  the  latter  that  desire  the  appointment  of 
Artimonoff.  The  [lessees’]  officers  desire  the  retention  of  Bootrin,  as  they  say  he  is  a  man 
of  better  sense,  more  industrious,  and  reliable  and  fully  competent  for  the  position.  The 
natives  also  complained  that  there  was  partiality  shown  in  the  distribution  of  the  sea  lion 
moneys.  Mr.  B.G.  McIntyre,  the  [lessee’s]  agent,  denies  this,  and  says  that  there  are  a  few 
indolent  men,  especially  among  the  older  natives  who  never  participate  in  the  drives,  nor 
clean  the  skins  . . .  that  he  (McIntyre)  was  perfectly  willing  to  pay  every  man  for  his  labor 
but  did  not  believe  in  encouraging  indolence,  or  in  paying  the  lazy  for  the  work  they  refuse 
to  perform,  and  which  is  accomplished  by  the  industrious — in  other  words,  to  those  who 
do  the  labor  he  shall  give  the  pay.  Col.  Marston  after  hearing  their  grievances  desired  them 
to  call  again  on  Monday  next.39

September  27,  1875 

In  the  meeting  had  with  natives  in  the  salthouse,  it  was  decided  that  no  changes  be  made  in 
the  chiefs  at  present.  I  also  told  them  that  the  sea  lion  belonged  to  the  people  and  could  not 
be  bargained  away.40 

The  following  entry  by  Assistant  Treasury  Agent  William  McIntyre  (no  relation  to 
ACC  agent  B.  G.  McIntyre)  was  challenged  by  Marston,  as  noted  in  the  November  first 
entry  to  the  Agent’s  Log. 


October  24,  1875

manner,  papered,  painted,  and  are  peculiarly  adapted  to  the  climate,  and  the  habits  of  the 
people.  These  sixty  four  houses  have  cost  the  Company  about  $44,800.00,  and  as  it  was  an 
obligation  voluntarily  assumed  by  them,  it  is  but  justice  to  state  that  they  are  entitled  to

the  gratitude  of  every  Aleute  [sic]  on  the  island.  This  noble  generosity  on  the  part  of  the 
Company  is  in  keeping  with  their  general  dealings  with  the  natives  especially  in  providing 
at  their  own  expense  for  all  the  widows  and  orphans.  Similar  provision  is  being  made  for 
the  natives  at  St.  George,  and  for  some  at  Onalaska.  The  village  of  St.  Paul  will  today,  in 
health,  and  all  the  comforts  of  life,  compare  favorably  with  any  town  of  the  same  number  of 
inhabitants  in  the  states,  (over*  next  page)41 

The  postscript  marked  with  an  asterisk  was  presumably  added  by  Marston  and  re¬ 
ferred  to  the  log  entry  for  November  first: 

November  1,  1875 

The  record  of  Sunday  Oct.  24th,  the  page  before  this,  got  into  this  book  without  my  seeing 
it.  As  I  was  in  charge  of  the  Island  at  the  time,  I  wish  to  say  ‘tis  not  true.  These  houses  only 
cost  the  Co.  about  three  hundred  dollars  each,  and  they  give  nothing.  The  houses  were  built 
to  get  possession  of  the  land  by  the  Co.  Natives  done  much  of  the  work  themselves.  Geo. 
Marston.42 

An  additional  log  entry,  written  by  Marston  on  October  25,  is  included  here  because 
of  historical  interest  in  the  evolution  of  dwelling  types  on  the  islands,  beginning  with  the 
semi-subterranean  sod-covered  homes  called  barabaras  to  wood-frame  and  concrete/ 
brick  homes. 


October  25,  1875 

Natives  engaged  in  pulling  down  Moleveedoffs  old  house,  it  having  been  decided  [to  build] 
a  new  one  a  little  north  of  the  site  occupied  by  the  old  one;  also  the  Priest’s  barrabrakie  [sic 
passim],  which  is  torn  down  to  make  room  for  Moleveedoffs  house.  A  new  barrabrakie  will 
be  built  back  of  Artimonoffs  house,  to  be  occupied  by  Cassian  Shyenekoff  and  wife,  and 
Herman  Artimonoff.43 

On  November  21,  Marston’s  growing  displeasure  over  the  antics  of  the  ACC  agents 
was  expressed  through  a  somewhat  disjointed  commentary  in  an  apparent  moment  of 
frustration  and  rage: 

The  truth  is — he  [Co.  Agent  B.G.  McIntyre]  got  his  Irish  up  because  I  would  not  let  him 
bargain  with  [Native  Chief]  Butrin  to  drive  these  peoples  to  go  at  the  risk  of  their  health 
and  lives  to  get  Sea  lion  [sic]  belonging  solely  to  this  people  and  then  take  them  [sea  lion 
skins]  all  away  from  them  on  his  own  terms.  So  to  spit  his  spite  out  upon  me  and  Capt. 

Bryant,  (as  he  made  his  brags)  he  had  this  house  built,  and  put  where  Dr.  McIntyre  [B.G. 

McIntyre’s  brother],  Genl.  Co.  Agt.,  had  told  both  Capt.  Bryant  and  me  none  should  be 
built.  Said  he  [emphasis  by  Marston]  would  teach  these  Gov’t  Agents  to  keep  their  place.  At 
the  time  I  was  arguing  against  putting  the  house  there,  he  said  he  knew  that  Capt.  Bryant 
did  not  want  one  there,  and  that  he  should  like  to  accommodate  him,  but  he  says  that  is 
asking  too  much.  As  Ben  McIntyre  nor  the  Alaska  Comm.  Co.  neither  of  them  own  one 
foot,  no  not  one  inch  of  land  on  this  whole  Island.  The  audacity  of  the  above  remark  from 
the  truthful  creature  was  more  farcical  than  decent.  It  put  me  in  mind  of  the  record  in 
the  Bible,  where  the  devil  took  our  Savior  up  into  a  high  mountain  and  offered  him  all  the 
Kingdom  of  the  earth,  if  he  would  fall  down  and  worship  him — a  nice  offer,  when  the  old 
tormentor  owned  not  an  inch  of  all  God’s  creation.44 

Marston’s  feelings  toward  the  ACC  agents  had  not  subsided  by  the  next  day. 

November  22,  1875 

They  killed  the  Sea  lion  today  about  12  PM45  without  informing  me  anything  about  it.  A 
contemptible  trick  that  will  not  be  again  passed  over. 

The  Sea  lion  belong  to  this  people,  and  by  the  eternal  they  shall  have  them  to  use  or  dispose 
of  as  they  please  without  let  or  hindrance  from  anyone,  or  any  power,  tis  all  the  resource

Rows  of  houses  constructed  by  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  likely  during  the  1870s,

they  have  for  some  months  of  the  year,  except  a  few  fox  skins  that  they  have  to  compete  for 
in  getting,  with  some  of  the  employees  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Co. 

The  Alaska  Commercial  Co.  have  a  lease  to  take  fur  Seal,  under  certain  regulations,  and 
nothing  more.  This  last  would  seem  to  be  enough,  as  they  make  more  money  out  of  that 
alone  for  the  amount  involved,  than  any  other  business  on  God’s  given  earth,  or  in  the 
waters  thereof.  So  I  say  they  ought  to  be  satisfied,  and  teach  their  agents  to  leave  the  Sea 
lion  business  to  the  people  under  the  Gov’t,  officer.  I  make  the  Record  because  an  attempt 
was  made  by  Butrin  one  of  the  Chiefs  to  bargain  away  to  the  A.C.  Co.  all  the  Sea  lion  skins, 
intestines,  throats,  etc.  without  consulting  the  peoples.  Five  or  six  of  the  best  citizens  came 
to  me  and  made  complaint,  about  his  bargaining  away  their  rights.  I  have  now  settled  as 
I  understand  Capt.  Bryant  had  it.  That  the  Sea  lion  belong  to  this  people,  and  under  the 
Supervision  of  the  Gov’t  Agent  in  charge,  will  generally  be  driven  here  and  killed,  so  that 
the  meat-blubber  and  all  can  be  saved  to  them.46 

Assistant  Agent  George  Marston  was  reassigned  to  St.  George  Island  on  September 
22,  1876,  to  replace  William  McIntyre  (as  noted,  no  relation  to  the  ACC’s  Benjamin 
McIntyre),  who  resigned  effective  September  30,  1876.47  He  made  numerous  observa¬ 
tions  in  the  Agent's  Log  about  life  and  conditions  on  the  islands,  wonderfully  descriptive 
despite  somewhat  idiosyncratic  spelling  and  writing  style. 

Religion 

This  [emphasis  by  Marston]  is  Russian  Christmas.  Church  service  from  two  this  morning 
and  so  along  at  intervals  all  day.  At  5  p.m.  we  all  attended.  Mr.  Artimonoff  had  chairs  kindly 
provided  for  the  Americans.  After  church  was  out  we  went  to  the  Company  House,  where 
we  were  entertained  by  the  singers  who  were  round  with  stars,  and  other  mottoes  of  some

sort  of  flags  with  them  borne  by  the  boys.  They  sang  very  well,  and  their  emblems  looked 
quite  pretty.48 

The  masqueraders  were  round  in  several  parties  some  with  accordions,  they  played  and 
danced.  A  number  of  them  called  here.  They  behaved  first  rate  and  I  enjoyed  the  calls.  I 
came  near  forgetting  to  say  that  the  old  lady  who  does  the  washing  at  the  Company  House 
was  one  of  the  above  party  dressed  in  men’s  clothes.  She  carried  it  out  well,  and  danced  as 
spry  as  a  Boy,  and  appeared  as  young  as  any  of  them.49 

This  is  the  last  day  of  Christmas  “praisnicks”  called  Christiania  (Chrischana)  day.  At  the 
close  of  Church  Service  (about  noon)  the  priest  blessed  a  large  cask  of  water  for  the  season, 
the  natives  all  run  for  their  various  vessels  to  get  some  of  this  water  to  take  home  some 
with  pitchers  some  with  tea  pots  some  with  bowls,  etc.  etc.  The  winding  up  of  the  church 
service  was  very  interesting  as  it  put  me  in  mind  of  the  beginning  of  battle  or  the  4th  of 
luly.  It  was  the  firing  of  five  heavy  guns,  each  loaded  with  one  and  a  half  pounds  of  powder. 
They  were  let  off  on  the  Plaza  in  front  of  the  Govt,  house  about  noon.  These  guns  spoke  in 
loud  tone.50 

Three  marriages  took  place  at  the  church  this  forenoon.  Timafay  Evanoff  and  Evo  Austigoff, 
Stephen  KozerofF  and  Maria  Sedick,  Stepetin  NeaderazofF  to  Anna  Meeseekin.  After  the 
Priest  had  got  through  with  the  long  service,  which  was  performed  as  the  parties  stood  side 
by  side  with  large  spermacetic  candles  lighted  in  the  hand  of  each  of  the  lovers,  they  all 
kissed  three  times  each,  that  is,  each  of  the  pair.  Thus  were  three  couples  united  in  the  holy 
bonds  of  matrimony  today. 

After  the  above  was  over,  a  child  ten  days  old  of  Markiel  VolcofF  was  brought  in  by  Doctress 
Mary  Sedick  to  be  christened,  this  ceremony  was  longer  than  the  moral  law,  the  little  thing 
yelled  and  had  to  be  nursed  while  the  Priest  was  saying  or  reading  over  the  long  service, 
finally  he  got  through  reading  and  the  child  was  stripped  and  then  taken  by  the  Priest  and 
dipped  three  times  into  a  tub  of  water — he  saying  over  some  sort  of  rite,  he  then  put  the 
child  into  the  arms  of  Stephen  Belevlazoff,  Godfather,  who  stood  two  paces  to  the  rear  of 
the  tub  of  water  with  linen  &  calico  across  his  arms  and  lighted  candle  in  hand  to  receive 
the  said  infant. 


While  this  rite  was  being  performed  an  incident  occurred  which  is  proper  here  to  record. 

As  Mrs.  Dr.  Mary  Sedick  who  had  brought  the  child  in,  and  was  standing  by  the  side  of  the 
Godfather  to  take  it  home  again  as  soon  as  the  sendee  was  over,  she  was  suddenly  called 
out  from  her  place  to  attend  upon  the  wife  of  John  Fratis  in  the  birth  of  another  son.  She 
left  as  gracefully  and  as  easy  as  a  swan  could  swim  down  the  lagoon,  and  with  as  little  noise 
or  flutter,  simply  whispering  to  Mrs.  Beleylazoff  to  take  her  place,  while  she  assisted  in 
bringing  another  sealer  to  St.  Paul,  on  this  eventful  Sunday  May  7th  1876.51 

Father  Nicholv  [Nikolai  Kovrigin]  conducted  the  church  service  today.  His  interesting  and 
eloquent  discourse  was  listened  to  very  attentively  by  a  large  audience.  No  man  could  talk 
better  than  he  did  to  them,  he  advised  them  to  send  their  children  to  the  school  that  the 
American  government  had  kindly  provided  for  them,  and  for  them  to  learn  the  English 
language,  as  they  were  now  and  always  would  be  under  the  great  American  nation  and  a 
part  of  it.  A  ball  was  given  in  the  evening  at  the  school  house  under  the  auspices  of  the 
Agents  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Co.,  much  rain  during  the  night.52 

Father  Nicholas  T.  Koveregein  (Father  Nikolai)  departed  St.  Paul  Island  on  July  27, 
1876.53 


Sleigh  ride 

Fair  day  and  plenty  of  snow,  by  invitation  of  B.G.  McIntyre  went  to  a  sleigh  ride  on  a  sled  or 
land  schooner  fixed  up  with  four  chairs  fastened  with  cords.  We  were  drawn  by  two  mules 
in  tandem,  with  Nicholi  [Krukoff?]  on  the  forward  one  as  guide,  footman  and  post  rider. 
The  party’  was  made  up  of  four,  Mrs.  C.P.  Fish,  Airs.  Wm.  J.  Alclntyre,  B.G.  Alclntyre  and 
myself.  We  had  a  gay  and  palatial  ride.  I  got  tipped  off  one  by  my  chair  leg  getting  into  a

Fredericka  (Freddie)  Imogene  Martin  was  born 
in  Cooperstown,  New  York,  on  June  2,  1905. 

Her  father  died  in  an  accident  before  her  birth. 

When  she  was  five  her  mother  remarried  and 
they  moved  to  Oneonta,  New  York.  Fredericka 
Martin  married  Dr.  Samuel  Righter  Berenberg 
(born  August  2,  1910,  died  June  1982  at  Paris, 

France)62  in  1940.  They  had  one  child— a  daugh¬ 
ter,  Tobyanne— born  on  St.  Paul  Island  in  1941. 

Martin  and  Berenberg  divorced  in  1950,  and  she 
moved  to  Cuernavaca,  Mexico.  Fredericka  Martin 
died  October  4,  1992,  at  Cuernavaca  at  the  age 
of  eighty-seven  years.63  Her  daughter  interred  her

Biographical  Sketch 

A  biographical  sketch  of  Fredericka  Martin  pre¬ 
pared  by  Jessica  Weglein  of  New  York  University’s 
Tamiment  Library  shows  the  development  of  Martin’s  strong  character  and  humanity, 
qualities  that  aided  the  Pribilof  Aleuts  in  achieving  their  long-sought  independence  from 
being  wards  of  the  government: 

Fredericka  (Freddie)  Imogene  Martin  -  Spanish  Civil  War  nurse,  writer,  and  historian  . . . 
a  spirited  child  by  her  own  account . . .  grew  up  in  a  warm  and  indulgent  family.  Following 
high  school,  she  lived  and  worked  with  the  St.  Margaret  Episcopalian  Order  of  Nuns 
in  Jersey  City,  New  Jersey,  and  in  1925  attended  the  affiliated  nursing  school  of  Christ 
Hospital.  She  graduated  with  honors  and  as  a  young  woman  practiced  professionally  in 
hospitals  throughout  New  York  City.  As  supervisor  and  head  nurse  she  served  on  the 
staffs  of  Bellevue,  Fordham,  Lying-In  Hospital,  and  Crotona  Park  Hospital.  In  1929,  Martin 
married  English-born  Alexander  Cohen.  During  the  early  1930s  Martin  became  an  active 
member  in  the  nurses  union,  attended  political  science  classes  at  the  Labor  Temple  in  New 
York  City,  and  began  developing  her  aptitude  for  foreign  languages,  learning  Russian  and 
Yiddish.  In  1935,  while  visiting  her  in-laws  in  England  she  traveled  to  Germany  and  Russia. 

Her  time  abroad  awakened  her  to  the  growing  threat  of  Fascism.  When  she  returned,  a 
nurses’  union  colleague  encouraged  Martin  to  become  active  in  the  then  nascent  Medical 
Bureau  to  Aid  Spanish  Democracy.  Initially  organized  by  a  group  of  doctors  and  concerned 
citizens  to  provide  medical  supplies,  food  and  clothing  to  the  beleaguered  Spanish 
Republic,  by  late  1936  the  Medical  Bureau  was  recruiting  personnel  to  send  to  Spain  as 
well. 

On  January  16,  1937  Martin  embarked  on  the  S.S.  Paris  as  part  of  the  first  American 
medical  unit  to  Spain.  Under  the  leadership  of  surgeon  Dr.  Edward  Barsky,  Martin  served 
as  chief  nurse  and  administrator  of  the  American  Hospital  division.  The  first  unit  traveled

with  four  ambulances,  12  tons  of  medical  supplies  and  all  the  necessary  equipment  to  outfit 
a  50-bed  hospital.  During  her  period  of  service,  Martin  supervised  the  work  of  fifty-four 
nurses,  aided  in  the  organization  of  six  American  hospitals  on  four  fronts,  and  helped  set 
up  a  mobile  operating  unit.  She  also  organized  literacy  classes  and  trained  Spanish  women 
to  assume  some  of  the  nursing  and  hospital  administration  duties.  Her  commanding 
bearing  (at  nearly  5’9”  she  was  a  full  head  taller  than  most  of  her  staff),  authoritative 
mien,  and  maternal  attention  to  both  the  patients  in  the  ward  and  the  nurses  under  her 
management,  earned  her  the  affectionate  appellation  of  “Ma.” 

In  February  1938  Martin  returned  to  the  United  States  to  conduct  a  yearlong  national 
speaking  tour,  recruiting  personnel  and  raising  funds  to  keep  the  medical  volunteers  in 
Spain  supplied.  During  the  West  Coast  stretch  of  her  tour  Martin  shared  the  stage  with  a 
representative  of  the  Catalan  government,  and  writer  Dorothy  Parker.  Following  her  tour, 

Martin  enrolled  in  the  Public  Administration  program  at  New  York  University.  Her  studies 
were  cut  short  when,  in  April  1939,  she  was  invited  to  establish  and  serve  as  superintendent 
of  a  hospital  in  Greenbelt,  Maryland— a  federally  funded  housing  initiative  created  under 
the  Resettlement  Administration. 

Martin’s  union  with  Cohen  ended  in  an  amicable  divorce  in  the  late  1930s  and  [in  1940] 
she  married  her  second  husband,  Dr.  Samuel  Berenberg  [a  doctor  at  Greenbelt].  In  1941 
Berenberg  took  a  medical  assignment  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  300  miles  off  the  coast  of 
Alaska  in  the  Bering  Sea.  With  Martin’s  assistance,  Berenberg  managed  the  Fish  and 
Wildlife  Hospital  on  St.  Paul  Island.  Martin’s  work  brought  her  into  contact  with  the 
indigenous  Aleut  sealing  community,  non-citizen  wards  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  the 
Interior.  Stirred  by  their  struggle  for  self-determination  and  freedom  from  decades 
of  discrimination  and  exploitation  (first  under  the  Russians  and  later  the  American 
government),  Martin  spent  the  next  ten  years  of  her  life  advocating  on  behalf  of  the 
community.  She  came  to  be  regarded  as  an  expert  on  the  Aleut,  producing  a  series  of 
articles  and  books  including  The  Hunting  of  the  Silver  Fleece  [1946],  and  Sea  Bears:  the 
Story  of  the  Fur  Seal  [1960],  editing  an  Aleut  language  dictionary,  and  translating  numerous 
manuscripts  and  articles. 

With  the  bombing  of  Pearl  Harbor,  Martin  and  Berenberg  returned  to  Greenbelt  with 
their  newborn  daughter  Tobyanne  (named  for  Toby  Jensky  and  Anne  Taft,  two  nursing 
colleagues  who  had  served  with  Martin  in  Spain).  They  settled  in  New  York  City  where 
Berenberg  became  the  chief  of  the  Department  of  Health’s  Child  Health  Services  and 
Martin  embarked  on  her  career  as  a  writer.  Following  the  dissolution  of  their  marriage, 

Martin  moved  with  the  9-year-old  Tobyanne  in  1950  to  Cuernavaca,  Mexico.  A  cultural 
outpost  for  Spanish  exiles  and  American  expatriates,  Cuernavaca  proved  to  be  a  congenial 
home  for  Martin.  For  the  next  40  years  she  supported  herself  as  translator,  a  travel  book 
writer,  and  an  instructor  at  a  Spanish  language  institute,  working  with  her  former  Medical 
Bureau  colleague  and  fellow  expatriate  Lini  (Fuhr)  de  Vries.64 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Fredericka  Berenberg  nee  Martin  accompanied  her  husband  Samuel  R.  Berenberg,  a  spe¬ 
cialist  in  childhood  diseases,  to  St.  Paul  Island,  where  he  worked  at  the  U.S.  Fish  and 
Wildlife  Service  hospital.  They  arrived  aboard  the  Fish  and  Wildlife  supply  vessel  Penguin 
on  June  24,  1941.  “Freddie”  was  seven  months  pregnant  at  the  time. 

While  preparing  for  the  trip,  Martin’s  curiosity  about  the  Aleut  people  and  con¬ 
cern  for  their  welfare  somehow  connected  her  with  linguist  Richard  Henry  Geoghegan 
of  Fairbanks,  Alaska.65  Martin  and  Geoghegan  corresponded  regularly;  he  supplied  her 
with  historical  background  material  about  the  Aleuts  and  the  Pribilof  Islands,  and  she 
assisted  him  as  editor  and  typist  for  his  1944  book  TJte  Aleut  Language:  The  Elements  Of

and  English. 

The  language  and  overall  well-being  of  the  people  of  St.  Paul  Island  became  a  lifelong 
obsession  for  Fredericka  Martin.  In  June  1942,  the  U.S.  military  evacuated  the  Natives 
and  civilian  government  personnel  from  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  response  to  the  Japanese 
aerial  attack  on  Dutch  Harbor.66  The  islands’  Natives  and  some  government  personnel 
were  relocated  to  Funter  Bay,  Alaska.6  The  Berenberg  family  also  traveled  to  the  Funter 
Bay  Relocation  Camp,  but  they  did  not  debark  from  the  transport  Delarof.  The  family 
continued  on  to  Seattle,  Washington.68  The  traumatic  relocation  and  the  dismal  sight  of 
the  relocation  camps  troubled  Fredericka  Martin.  She  immediately  began  sending  off  let¬ 
ters  to  government  officials  advocating  better  living  conditions  for  the  Pribilof  Aleuts.69 
Government  officials  allegedly  accused  Fredericka  Martin  of  being  a  communist  to  un¬ 
dermine  her  efforts  to  help  the  Pribilovians — accusations  that  eventually  backfired  as 
they  were  brought  to  light  to  discredit  the  government  and  to  sustain  Martin’s  heroic 
efforts  to  bring  justice  to  the  people  of  the  Pribilofs  (Jones,  A  Century  of  Servitude,  126).70 
Among  her  efforts,  she  proposed  a  plan  to  properly  pay  the  Natives  for  work  performed 
in  government  service.  Martin’s  plan  was  finally  implemented  in  1951.  While  it  lacked 
the  same  equities  entitled  to  other  workers  in  the  United  States,  it  served  as  the  first  step 
toward  full  compensation  and  benefits  allowed  under  the  Civil  Service  Act.  The  initial 
step  provided  “for  a  small  annual  wage  with  a  gradual  transition  to  a  full  one.”  It  also  al¬ 
lowed  for  annual  wage  increases  “based  on  wage  rates  on  the  Alaska  Peninsula  and  the 
consumer  price  index  for  a  moderate  income  family  in  Seattle,”  and  a  continuation  of,  but 
at  a  reduced  rate,  the  “seal  bonus.”  The  seal  bonus  was  based  on  the  number  of  sealskins 
taken  by  the  Natives  and  the  amount  received  from  sales.71 

A  substantial  part  of  Martin’s  work  on  behalf  of  the  Aleuts  materialized  in  her  writ¬ 
ings  about  the  islands,  in  her  own  books,  in  magazine  and  newspaper  editorials,  and  in 
translations  of  other  writers’  works.72 

In  1986,  Fredericka  Martin  returned  to  Alaska— first  to  Fairbanks,  where  she  received 
an  honorary  doctorate  from  the  University  of  Alaska,  and  then  to  St.  Paul,  where  she  was 
made  an  honorary  citizen  of  the  island.73

Maynard,  Richard  (1832-1907) 

Photographer,  British  Commission  to  Pribilof  Islands,  1892 
Genealogy 

Richard  Maynard  was  born  in  Stratton,  Cornwall,  England,  on  February  22,  1832,  to 
Thomas  Maynard  and  Mary  (Squires)  Maynard.  Richard  married  Hannah  Hatherly 
(1834-1918)  in  England  in  1852.74 

Biographical  Sketch 

Richard  Maynard  was  apprenticed  as  a  shoemaker  and  fashioner  of  leather  goods,  but  he 
felt  a  connection  to  the  sea,  a  calling  he  pursued  in  the  coasting  trade  between  England 
and  Wales  during  the  summer  months.  Eventually  the  Maynards  moved  to  Brownville, 
Ontario,  Canada.  The  Fraser  River  gold  rush  of  1859  brought  Maynard  further  west,  and 
he  and  his  wife,  Hannah,  settled  in  Victoria,  British  Columbia,  in  1862.  Richard  learned 
photographic  techniques  from  his  wife,  who  “having  learned  photography  in  Ontario, 
opened  one  of  Victoria’s  first  portrait  studios,  Mrs.  R.  Maynard’s  Photographic  Gallery, 
on  Johnson  Street.  Richard,  a  shoemaker  by  trade,  opened  an  adjoining  boot  and  shoe 
store,  but  he  preferred  photography.  The  Maynards  traveled  throughout  the  Pacific 
Northwest,  creating  an  extensive  collection  of  negatives.  .  .  .  Hannah  and  her  husband 
Richard  practiced  landscape  photography. . . .  Hannah’s  work  in  both  landscape  and  por-

trait  photography  has  made  an  important  contribution  to  the  documentation  of  British 
Columbia  history.”75 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

The  Canadian  government  appointed  Richard  Maynard  as  its  official  photographer  to  the 
British  Commission  investigating  the  fur-seal  question  posed  before  the  Paris  Tribunal 
of  Arbitration.  Maynard  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  on  the  afternoon  of  July  21,  1892,  with 
James  Macoun,  Canadas  seal  expert  and  botanist 6  (see  James  Macoun’s  biography). 
Maynard  documented  his  daily  experiences  in  letters  to  Hannah.  The  following  three 
lengthy  missives  found  in  the  British  Columbia  Archives  were  handwritten  and  have  been 
transcribed  exactly  as  composed,  leaving  intact  Maynard’s  colorful  spellings — in  which 
the  reader  occasionally  can  almost  hear  his  British  accent  coming  through — as  well  as  his 
colorful  descriptions.  It’s  easy  to  imagine  the  pleasure  that  the  letters  from  “your  loving 
husband,”  written  after  exhausting  days  on  the  island,  brought  to  his  family.

Dear  Wife  we  arrived  here  all  right  &  you  must  excuse  me  for  not  writing  more  a  letter 
from  Oonalaska  for  I  was  only  given  one  hour  notice  when  leavin  thair  &  did  not  know 
than  that  the  Danube  was  goin  back  to  Victoria  until  one  of  the  men  told  me  just  as  we 
were  starting  so  I  put  one  of  the  little  books  in  an  envelope  &  gave  it  to  him  to  take  to  the 
waiter  that  had  my  packing  of  clothes  &  plates  to  take  to  you,  it  is  very  foggy  at  present  6  in 
the  morning  but  we  are  goin  about  12  miles  to  a  rookery  today. 

July  23,  1892 

Well  we  have  been  to  [North]  east  Point  &  got  back  &  have  seen  something  that  no  one 
would  believe  unless  he  seen  it  for  himself  in  the  shape  of  seals,  we  also  seen  lots  of  blue 
foxes  &  all  kinds  of  birds,  but  only  one  little  snow  bunting.  I  would  like  to  get  some  of  them 
but  no  one  is  allowed  to  fire  a  gun  on  the  Island  &  no  one  allowed  to  walk  about  without 
some  one  with  him  for  fear  he  would  disturb  the  seals  we  seen  lots  of  them  dead  laying 
around  killed  by  fighting  with  one  another  &  in  tumbing  about  in  the  fight  the  kill  lots  of 
than  pups,  it  is  very  foggy  today  so  I  have  nothing  to  do  by  walk  around  &  write,  to  day 
I  saw  several  Snow  Buntings  &  lots  of  other  birds  that  I  would  like  to  get  but  expect  to 
get  some  on  St.  George  Island  as  that  is  the  Island  for  birds,  I  wish  I  had  more  plates  Mr. 
McGowen  wants  the  plates  I  fetched  for  myself  I  ought  to  have  brought  double  what  I  did. 

Sunday  24 

Still  very  foggy  &  cold  the  mail  steamer  is  supposed  to  leave  here  today  so  I  had  better  close 
this  letter  &  if  she  dose  not  go  I  may  get  something  else  to  put  in  so  good  by  for  the  present 
from  your  loving  husband

Many  of  Richard  and  Emma  Maynard’s  photographs  are  conserved  by  the  British 
Columbia  Archives  in  Victoria,  B.C.  The  Archives  cataloged  Richard  Maynard’s  photo¬ 
graphs  in  a  notebook  that  is  kept  separate  from  his  photo  collection.  In  1985,  Author 
David  Mattison  said  of  Richard  Maynard’s  work: 

Mr.  Maynard’s  photographic  work  has  been  of  the  highest  order  of  excellence,  and  all  the 
photography  bearing  the  Maynard  imprint  represents  the  best  in  that  art.  He  has  done  a 
great  deal  of  work  along  this  line  for  the  government.  He  was  in  the  Behring  Sea  and  took 
the  photographs  of  the  seals,  which  were  sent  to  Paris  to  be  used  for  evidence  in  the  famous 
arbitration  case  concerning  the  seal  fisheries.78

and  Rosabelle  had  three  children:  Mary,  born 
October  10,  1874;  Bradford,  born  August  12, 

1880,  and  Alice,  born  August  23, 1885.  4  Benjamin 
McIntyre’s  brothers  were  Hugh  H.  and  Hamden, 
who  also  worked  at  the  Pribilof  Islands. 

Biographical  Sketch 

Benjamin  McIntyre  spent  his  early  life  in 
Randolph,  Vermont,  on  his  father’s  farm  and  in 
the  local  public  schools.  “Ben  was  much  more 
than  a  passing  good  fellow.  He  was  not  only  a 
most  successful,  energetic,  enterprising  business 
manager,  and  the  most  trusted  of  all  the  numer¬ 
ous  agents  of  his  employers,  but  a  large-hearted, 
generous,  free-handed  man,  whose  friends  loved 
him  with  surpassing  affection  and  whose  en¬ 
emies  respected  him  because  they  could  not  do 
otherwise.”80  During  1869-1870,  Benjamin  was 
engaged  in  the  manufacture  of  paper  boxes  in 
Boston. 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Probably  under  the  influence  of  his  brother  Hugh  McIntyre,  Benjamin  traveled  to  Alaska 
and  went  to  work  for  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  (ACC).  His  brother  Hugh  had 
first  worked  for  the  federal  government  as  a  special  agent  in  Alaska,  including  the  Seal 
Islands  (1868  through  early  1870;  see  Hugh  H.  McIntyre  biography).  Benjamin  McIntyre 
rapidly  rose  to  the  position  of  general  agent  for  the  ACC  at  Kodiak  and  continued  therein 
until  his  violent  and  untimely  death  on  November  1,  1886.  “On  that  day,  the  evening  of 
his  departure  for  home  while  entertaining  his  friends  at  dinner  at  his  headquarters  sta¬ 
tion  on  Kodiak  Island,  Alaska,  an  assassin  [“Peter  Andresoff,  A  Russian  from  the  River 
Don”  area  of  Russia81],  in  revenge  for  some  fancied  wrong  done  him  by  the  company,  shot 
through  the  window,  killing  him  instantly  and  wounding  others  at  the  table.  The  miscre¬ 
ant  perished  from  cold  and  hunger  in  the  Kodiak  Mountains  in  attempting  to  escape.”82 

One  of  the  people  sitting  at  the  table  when  Benjamin  McIntyre  was  shot  was  the 
English  explorer  Heywood  Walter  Seton  Karr,  on  a  New  York  Times  expedition  to  Alaska. 
Karr  recounted  the  incident  as  follows: 

St.  Paul,  Kodiak  Island,  Alaska 
November  3d,  1886 

The  night  before  last  I  was  the  eye-witness  to  a  shocking  murder— none  other  than  that  of 
the  general  agent,  whose  corpse  is  on  board.  We  start  at  noon  for  California,  nearly  two 
thousand  miles  distant. 

We  were  seated  at  supper  at  six  o’clock  in  the  evening — McIntyre  at  the  head  of  the  table, 
and  Woche,  a  storekeeper,  at  the  foot.  Ivan  Petroff  [Customs  and  Signal  Service  Officer]

was  by  my  side.  The  meal  was  nearly  over,  and  McIntyre  had  half-turned  to  get  up  from 
his  chair,  when  a  terrible  explosion  suddenly  occurred,  filling  the  room  with  smoke  and 
covering  the  table  with  fragments  of  plates  and  glasses. 

McIntyre  never  moved,  for  he  was  killed  stone-dead  in  a  moment.  Woche  fell  under  the 
table,  and  then  rushed  out  streaming  with  blood  in  torrents,  for  he  was  shot  through  the 
lower  part  of  the  head.  The  double  glass  window  was  smashed  to  atoms,  for  a  cowardly 
fellow  had  fired  through  it,  from  just  outside,  with  a  spreading  charge  of  slugs,  presumably 
aiming  at  McIntyre,  who  received  the  main  part  of  it  in  his  back.  Meantime  the  murderer 
who  had  thus  shot  into  a  group  of  unarmed  and  unsuspecting  persons  had  time  to  escape. 

I  succeeded  in  stopping  the  bleeding  from  Woche’s  wounds,  every  one  appearing  paralysed! 

The  suspected  man,  Peter  Sanderson,  a  Cossack  of  the  Don,  cannot  be  found.  He  had, 
we  found,  attempted  to  fire  his  sloop,  lying  at  anchor  near  the  wharf;  and  had  refused 
employment  at  cod-fishing,  in  order,  as  he  said,  to  be  present  at  the  departure  of  the 
schooner.  He  had  also  been  seen  loitering  with  a  gun  behind  the  house.  He  owed  money 
to  McIntyre,  who  had  twice  fitted  him  out  for  sea-otter  hunting,  but  both  times  he  was 
unsuccessful.  We  have  been  scouring  the  woods  with  rifles,  but  the  natives  are  frightened 
to  death.  Not  a  light  can  be  seen  in  any  house  after  dark  for  fear  of  its  being  shot  into  by 
this  madman,  who  is  still  at  large  if  he  has  not  committed  suicide.  Nor  can  any  of  them 
be  got  to  stir  out  at  night,  or  to  keep  watch  like  sentries  over  the  sloop,  in  case  he  should 
return,  unless  a  white  man  is  with  them.83

Genealogy 

Emma  Jane  Baker  was  born  on  August  13,  1848,  to  Ashford  Baker  and  Julia  A.  Baker, 
in  Weymouth,  Massachusetts.  Emma  Baker  married  William  J.  McIntyre,  a  native  of 
New  York,  born  in  July  1845  to  Scottish  immigrant  parents  (see  biography  of  William 
McIntyre).  The  wedding  took  place  sometime  before  their  departure  in  1874  to  the 
Pribilof  Islands,  where  William  J.  McIntyre  was  appointed  Assistant  Special  Agent  to  the 
U.S.  Treasury  Department.84 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Emma  was  seven  months  pregnant  when  the  McIntyres  arrived  at  St.  George  Island  in 
1874.  She  dedicated  some  time  to  writing  a  “little  book,”  recording  her  observations  of  the 
Pribilof  Islands.85  Her  writings,  sent  to  her  mother,  recorded  important  details  about  life 
on  the  Seal  Islands  during  the  early  1870s.

My  Dear  Mother, 

I  have  from  time  to  time  written  in  this  little  book  matter  with  reference  to  this  island,  its 
inhabitants,  etc,  which  I  thought  might  be  of  interest  to  you.  I  send  it  in  this  shape  for  your 
perusal.  It  will  be  more  conveniently  read  than  if  scattered  over  several  sheets  of  paper.  You 
can  do  with  it  whatever  you  please — 

Your  devoted  daughter 
Emma 

The  island  of  St.  George  embraces  an  area  of  twenty-seven  square  miles,  showing 
everywhere  traces  of  volcanic  origins.  It  seems  to  be  a  huge  pile  of  rocks  partially  covered 
with  cinders  and  decomposed  vegetable  matter.  Some  of  the  Aleutian  islands  still  have 
active  volcanoes,  but  St.  George  has  none. 

On  some  portions  of  the  island  cliffs  rise  almost  perpendicular  from  the  sea,  to  the  height 
of  900  feet  and  more;  other  portions  of  the  sea-margin  are  rocky  and  more  gently  sloping 
inland.  There  are  only  three  very  small  sandy  beaches  on  the  island,  one  of  these  is  not  far 
from  the  village  and  is  a  pleasant  walk  at  low  tide. 

Fresh  water  ponds  supply  drinking  water  for  the  natives.  A  well  has  been  dug  for  the 
use  of  the  white  people  on  the  island,  but  it  is  shallow  and  sometimes  becomes  dry,  and 
is  consequently  not  always  to  be  relied  upon.  There  are  no  trees  or  shrubs  growing,  the 
only  vegetation  is  tall  coarse  grass,  the  wild  celery,  a  small  plant  bearing  a  berry  similar  in 
appearance  to  the  huckleberry  and  a  few  plants  bearing  blossoms  quite  pretty  to  look  at 
but  devoid  of  fragrance.  The  grass  furnishes  good  grazing  for  the  cattle,  sheep,  goats,  etc, 
which  have  been  brought  here  by  the  A.  C.  Co.  The  celery  root  is  considered  by  the  natives 
as  good  eating.  The  brown  berry  is  used  by  them  in  brewing  their  “quass”  a  vile  intoxicating 
drink.  I  have  commenced  making  a  collection  of  the  plants  and  flowers  of  the  island.  I 
have  written  instructions  as  to  the  best  manner  of  pressing  them,  obtained  from  Mrs.  H.H. 
McIntyre.  They  were  furnished  to  her  by  a  lady  botanical  friend.  At  a  certain  season  in  the 
Fall,  quite  pretty  sea  mosses  are  washed  up  on  the  South  shore  of  the  island.  If  possible  I 
shall  obtain  some  of  these. 


Temperature  of  the  Island 

Very  erroneous  ideas  are  entertained  in  regard  to  the  temperature  of  this  island.  Most 
persons  suppose  it  to  be  intensely  cold  in  winter  and  nearly  as  much  so  in  summer.  It 
would  be  so,  but  for  the  warm  ocean  currents  from  Japan,  which  reach  both  St.  George  and 
St.  Paul.  On  the  mainland  in  the  same  latitude  the  mercury  falls  as  low  as  50  &  60  degrees 
below  zero  while  here  it  is  seldom  if  ever  as  low  as  zero.  St.  Paul  is  a  little  colder  than  St. 
George.  The  temperature  varies  so  little  throughout  the  year  that  the  climate  is  very  healthy 
where  persons  live  in  comfortable  houses  and  observe  the  rules  of  health.  There  is  very 
much  fog  and  dampness  during  the  summer  and  Fall,  these  being  the  conditions  under 
which  the  seals  make  their  rookeries  here  in  preference  to  any  other  islands.  They  cannot 
bear  much  sunshine. 

There  are  many  bright  pleasant  days  during  the  year,  however,  particularly  in  the  spring 
&  early  summer  before  the  seals  commence  to  come  ashore.  This  month  of  May  has  been 
very  pleasant.  Occasionally  there  have  been  showers  of  rain  and  flurries  of  snow  but  no 
storms  of  severe  winds.  On  a  very  clear  day  &  from  a  high  point,  St.  Paul  can  be  seen.  St 
Paul  is  much  lower  than  St.  George  so  that  they  can  oftener  see  us  than  we  them.  Distance 
between  the  islands  is  40  miles.  The  coldest  weather  on  St.  George  the  past  winter  was  26 
degrees  above  zero.  How  does  this  compare  with  winters  in  the  Eastern  states? 

The  average  temperature  for  the  year  1871  was  28  degrees  + 

1872  was  28  degrees  + 

1873  was  29  degrees  + 


443 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


The  lowest  at  any  time  was  14.85  degrees,  this  was  the  average  for  the  month  of  March 
1871.  After  reading  this,  you  will  not  fear  of  our  freezing  up  here,  and  when  you  also  know 
that  we  have  ten  tons  of  coal  brought  every  year  for  the  Government  House. 

The  natives  burn  the  blubber  of  the  seal  for  fuel,  except  when  the  Company  furnishes  them 
with  coal  or  they  find  drift  wood  on  the  beaches  and  rocks.  In  speaking  of  the  vegetation  of 
the  Island,  I  neglected  to  mention  the  mosses.  So  moist  is  the  atmosphere  that  they  grow 
wherever  there  is  a  rock  for  them  to  grow  upon.  They  are  great  in  variety  and  beauty.  Mac 
obtained  some  on  the  highest  point  of  the  island  that  are  the  loveliest  I  ever  saw;  indeed  I 
did  not  know  that  mosses  ever  grew  so  pretty,  I  can  scarcely  describe  them  to  you,  but  will 
try. 

Some  are  a  thick  bed  of  bright  green  with  a  frosting  of  light  drab;  and  growing  thick  all  over 
the  moss  are  small  flowers  in  pink,  French  blue  and  violet  with  different  colored  centers. 
Another  kind  is  light  brown  in  two  or  three  shades  with  a  small  little  green  blossom 
surrounded  with  brown.  Another  has  a  growth  on  it  of  bright  coral  color.  There  are  many 
other  varieties,  but  these  are  the  finest. 


The  Natives 

Number  about  one  hundred  &  twenty.  They  are  a  mixture  of  Russian  and  Aleut.  Some 
are  full-blooded  Aleuts.  The  children  all  speak  the  Aleutian  language  &  the  parents  speak 
both  Aleut  &  Russian.  The  most  intelligent  speak  the  most  &  the  best  Russian.  Only  a 
very  few  speak  any  English.  There  are  two  brothers  named  Rezanzoff  who  understand  it 
very  well  &  speak  some.  The  Chief  does  not  speak  it  at  all.  When  the  Islands  came  into 
possession  of  the  United  States,  he  was  an  old  man  &  did  not  feel  ambition  to  learn  it  on 
that  account.  Under  the  Russian  dominion,  the  condition  of  these  people  was  fearful.  They 
lived  like  savages  and  were  dealt  with  in  the  most  severe  manner  by  the  Russians.  In  fact, 
the  Russians  themselves  who  spent  their  time  here  had  not  sufficient  ambition  to  live  much 
better  than  the  natives  themselves.  The  agents  describe  the  condition  of  things  three  or 
four  years  ago,  when  they  first  came  here,  as  most  deplorable.  Only  one  small  miserable 
wooden  building  on  the  island  besides  the  church  and  very  little  to  eat.  The  natives  were 
obliged  to  depend  upon  the  resources  of  the  island  mainly  for  food. 

Fancy  the  difference  of  things  then  and  now.  The  Government  has  a  fine  house  with  every 
convenience  for  the  agents  who  live  there.  The  Alaska  Commercial  Company  have  put  up 
a  large  dwelling  house  containing  sleeping,  round  sitting-room,  dining-room,  wash-room, 
store-room  &  a  very  fine  kitchen;  also  a  building,  a  portion  of  which  is  a  stable  and  the 
remainder  a  work  shop,  a  nice  large  store,  two  stories  high,  well  built  and  stocked  with 
goods  of  every  description;  a  ware-house  also  full  of  goods;  a  salt-house  for  the  salt  and 
skins  and  a  nice  building  for  the  pigs  and  poultry.  As  fast  as  they  can,  they  are  putting  up 
good  houses  for  the  natives  and  intend  in  another  year  to  take  down  all  the  turf  houses 
and  give  them  all  wooden  dwellings.  They  charge  the  natives  nothing  for  these,  and  require 
them  to  pay  no  rent.  This  is  also  being  done  at  St.  Paul,  where  a  great  many  more  will  be 
required  than  here.  The  Company  are  not  compelled  to  do  any  of  this.  Everything  is  done 
in  a  generous  spirit,  and  their  treatment  of  the  natives  is  always  just  and  kind.  Any  services 
rendered  them  by  the  natives  are  always  repaid  in  coin  and  they  are  often  paid  more  than 
they  deserve,  for  they  work  very  slowly  at  everything  but  sealing,  at  which  they  are  from 
long  practice,  very  expert. 

The  white  people  on  the  island  all  mess  together  at  the  Company’s  house,  having  more 
excellent  living.  They  hire  good  cooks  from  San  Francisco.  The  fare  consists  of  fresh  fish 
(cod  and  halibut  caught  by  the  natives  near  the  shore  of  the  island),  fresh  meat  occasionally 
chickens,  eggs,  milk,  everything  in  the  way  of  canned  fruits  and  vegetables,  nice  bread, 
splendid  butter  &  coffee,  etc,  etc.  The  tea  is  poor  and  that  is  the  only  thing.  They  have  had 
plenty  of  fresh  milk  all  the  past  winter  on  St.  George,  and  would  have  had  at  St.  Paul  if 
the  cow  had  been  properly  taken  care  of.  On  St.  George  there  are  now  ten  cows  and  two 
heifers,  several  goats,  two  sheep,  hogs  &  chickens  in  abundance;  so  that  when  meat  is 
wanted,  you  see  they  have  only  to  kill  &  eat.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


One,  of  course,  misses  fresh  strawberries,  melons,  peaches  &  such  as  that,  but  there  is 
nothing  in  the  way  of  substantials  to  be  desired.  Whenever  the  Steamer  or  vessel  comes  up 
from  San  Francisco  she  always  brings  such  fruit  as  will  keep  on  the  voyage.  The  natives  eat 
fish,  sea-lion  &  seal  meat  both  fresh  and  dried,  birds  and  eggs  and  groceries  from  the  store, 
which  are  always  sold  to  them  at  reasonable  rates.  Many  of  them  have  chickens  of  their 
own  and  the  Company  buy  the  eggs  of  them.  A  few  have  pigs.  The  Company  build  for  most 
of  their  dwellings  a  good  sized  building  apart  for  a  hen  house,  wood  house,  etc.  they  are 
paying  the  natives  now  to  paint  all  of  the  buildings  and  in  another  year,  this  will  be  a  very 
pretty  little  village.  The  houses  of  the  Gov.  &  Company  agents  are  to  have  a  fence  around  to 
keep  the  animals  at  a  respectful  distance. 

The  natives  are  generally  shorter  of  stature  than  Americans.  Their  color  is  much  that  of  the 
Chinese,  some  are  darker.  They  are  generally  very  healthy  some  of  them  living  to  a  good 
old  age.  Their  faces  are  not  at  all  repulsive  and  a  few  of  the  children  are  absolutely  pretty. 

As  regards  cleanliness  they  are  improving  very  much,  as  they  get  wooden  houses  and  see 
how  the  white  people  live.  Some  of  their  houses  are  kept  tolerably  clean.  Formerly  they 
had  not  much  idea  of  neatness.  The  government  agent  has  authority  to  compel  them  to 
keep  cleared  up  outside  their  buildings  and  Mr.  Falconer,  who  has  been  here,  now  for  four 
years,  has  improved  their  habits  &  condition  very  much,  through  his  unfailing  industry  and 
good  judgment.  He  has  had  a  nice  road  made  over  the  hill  from  the  shore  up  to  the  village; 
has  had  good  dry  soil  or  cinders  (for  such  is  the  character  of  the  soil)  placed  all  around  the 
government  buildings  and  the  brow  of  the  hill  and  has  kept  things  in  good  condition.  In 
this  particular  St.  George  is  far  ahead  of  St.  Paul. 

The  natives  dress  in  good  comfortable  clothes. 
Some  of  them  are  quite  well  off,  having  several 
hundred  dollars.  This  they  mostly  earn  during 
the  sealing  season.  Some  of  them  make  coats 
&  blankets  of  the  pup  skins  and  sell  them. 

One  thing  they  are  not  allowed  to  buy  in  as 
great  quantities  as  they  would  like,  and  that  is 
sugar;  for  with  this  they  would  be  constantly 
brewing  "Quass’  and  be  all  the  time  beastly 
intoxicated.  They  get  all  of  it  they  can,  however, 
and  use  many  things  as  a  substitute;  and  it  is 
necessary  for  the  gov.  &  Co’s  agents  to  work 
together  to  prevent  their  brewing.  They  are 
very  shrewd  in  concealing  this  and  it  requires 
a  vigilant  eye  to  detect  them  in  the  act.  If  they 
are  found  intoxicated  they  should  afterwards 
be  reprimanded  and  their  allowance  of  sugar 
shortened  for  a  while  as  a  punishment.  The 
women  drink  as  well  as  the  men.  They  do  not 
dare  to  resist  the  “government,”  it  is  a  magic 
work  [sic]  with  them.  So  fond  are  they  of  liquor, 
that  they  will  drink  Bay  Rum,  Cologne  and 
Florida  Water.  The  Company  had  sent  great 
quantities  of  these  articles  to  St.  George,  but  it 
soon  disappeared  and  they  have  been  advised 
to  do  so  no  more  as  the  natives  will  employ  any 
subterfuge  to  get  it. 

They  are  very  respectful  to  all  white  people 
here,  but  are  rather  deficient  in  gratitude  for 
favors  done  them. . . .  They  are  good  natured 
and  cheerful  and  not  at  all  revengeful.  The 
women  know  little  about  laundry  work.  A  flat 
iron  was  unknown  among  them  a  few  years 


Aleut  wearing  a  traditional  kamleika  made 
from  sea-lion  intestine.  This  garment  was 
worn  by  those  traveling  in  traditional  ocean¬ 
going  craft,  but  it  was  also  worn  on  land  as 
protection  against  the  rain  and  mist.  The 
man  in  the  photo  is  armed  with  a  club  used 
to  kill  fur  seals  and  a  knife  used  to  remove 
the  flippers  and  skin  from  the  seal  carcass.

ago.  One  or  two  girls  from  the  Islands  have  been  down  to  San  Francisco  and  learned  how 
to  wash  and  iron  and  have  taught  some  of  the  others.  We  have  a  woman  here  now  who 
does  our  washing  quite  well,  but  she  is  very  slow  about  it.  Any  kind  of  housework  they,  of 
course,  know  how  to  do  only  indifferently  if  at  all. 

The  Chief  was  appointed  by  the  A.C.Co.  when  they  took  possession  here.  He  is  quite 
intelligent  and  a  man  of  good  sense.  He  rings  a  bell  whenever  work  is  to  be  done,  thus 
calling  the  men  together  and  appoints  such  as  he  chooses  for  particular  kinds  of  work.  The 
agents  always  consult  with  him  when  they  wish  to  make  a  drive  of  seal  or  wish  assistance 
from  either  the  men  or  women  in  the  house  or  outside.  He  can  read  and  write  Russian  and 
keeps  account  of  the  labor  of  each  man.  Still  he  has  no  absolute  authority  among  them. 
There  is  always  a  second  chief  to  take  his  place  in  case  of  sickness  or  death. 

These  people  are  all  members  of  the  Greek  Church  and  are  very  devout  as  well  as 
superstitious.  The  service  is  read  by  one  of  the  men  as  they  cannot  afford  to  keep  a  priest 
for  so  small  a  church.  They  all  stand  during  service.  They  formerly  went  in  boats  to  St. 

Paul  to  attend  service,  but  finding  this  tiresome  &  dangerous,  they  resolved  to  build  for 
themselves  a  church  of  such  drift-wood  as  they  could  pick  up  from  time  to  time.  With  great 
credit  to  themselves  for  patience  &  perseverance,  they  accomplished  this  end  and  the  little 
old-fashioned  building  stands  now,  soon  however,  to  be  replaced  by  a  new  &  larger  church. 
The  new  building  will  be  placed  farther  up  on  the  hill  &  the  old  one  torn  down.  The  spot 
where  it  stands  will  always  be  sacred  ground  to  them  and  they  will  always  cross  themselves 
when  passing  it. 

At  St.  Paul  they  have  a  new  church  nearly  finished.  There  is  also  a  building  on  that  island 
which  is  a  great  curiosity.  It  is  built  in  the  native  style  of  building,  the  rafters  being  entirely 
composed  of  the  jaw  bones  of  whales.  It  has  stood  there  a  great  many  years  evidently  and 
bids  fair  to  last  a  century  longer. 


The  Sea  Lion 

There  is  on  the  south  side  of  the  Island  a  small  sea-lion  rookery  where  these  animals 
number  about  four  thousand  the  greater  portion  of  which  remain  around  the  Island  all 
winter  or  until  the  ice  drives  them  from  it.  During  this  time  many  are  taken  by  the  natives 
for  food,  the  flesh  being  of  a  much  finer  flavor  than  that  of  the  fur  seal.  The  skin  is  of  much 
value  for  the  manufacture  of  their  “Bidarkiee”  and  “Biderahs”  The  Bidarkies  are  long, 
narrow  boats  covered  on  the  top  and  excepting  one,  two  or  three  openings  where  men  may 
sit.  They  can  draw  their  water-proof  coats  made  of  the  intestines  of  the  sea-lion  over  these 
openings  &  tie  themselves  in,  thus  keeping  the  boat  perfectly  dry  even  if  a  wave  should 
break  over  &  give  the  men  themselves  a  drenching.  The  Biderahs  are  large  open  boats  with 
a  capacity  of  three  or  four  tons  burden.  These  are  mostly  used  in  loading  &  reloading  the 
Steamer.  They  are  very  light  &  so  strong  and  smooth  is  the  covering  that  they  easily  glide 
over  rocks  without  injury.  The  natives  used  to  use  the  sinews  of  the  Sea-Lion  for  thread,  the 
flipper  for  the  soles  of  their  boots  &  lining  of  the  throat  for  the  boot  leg.  They  make  very 
few  now  as  the  Company  furnishes  them  with  plenty  of  good  leather  boots  and  shoes. 

Foxes 

There  are  both  blue  and  white  foxes  upon  the  island.  The  latter  were  very  numerous 
when  the  Island  was  first  discovered  by  the  Russians.  The  white  fox  evidently  made  its 
way  to  the  island  on  the  ice  from  the  Arctic  or  main  land  during  some  severe  winter;  but 
the  appearance  of  the  blue  fox  is  unaccountable,  as  the  Pribyloff  islands  and  Attou  in  the 
extreme  western  end  of  the  Aleutian  chain,  are  the  only  places  in  America  where  they  are 
known  to  exist. 


Birds 

The  sides  of  the  cliffs  are  the  favorite  resort  of  myriads  of  water  fowl  who  come  here  every 
season  to  breed  while  others  breed  under  the  rocks  in  the  centre  of  the  Island.  During  the 
spring  &  summer  months  the  natives  very  readily  secure  without  incurring  much  danger, 
all  the  eggs  they  desire.  Stationing  themselves  along  the  edges  of  the  cliffs,  they  entrap  a

great  many  of  the  birds  by  means  of  a  net  fastened  over  a  hoop  attached  to  the  end  of  a 
long  pole.  One  can  see  in  one  minute  here,  more  birds  than  in  a  lifetime  anywhere  on  the 
Continent.  Mac  is  making  a  collection  of  the  birds,  their  nests  and  eggs.  He  has  learned  to 
stuff  the  birds  &  hopes  to  secure  two  of  each  species  before  he  leaves  the  island. 

Flies 

Are  very  numerous  during  the  summer  but  they  do  not  annoy  one  in  the  least.  They  have  a 
growth  of  fur  upon  them  and  to  me  are  a  great  curiosity.  There  are  no  other  insects  of  any 
consequence,  no  reptiles  &  no  cats  or  dogs. 

Of  the  seal  I  shall  write  but  little  as  there  is  so  much  to  be  said.  When  I  return,  I  will  tell  you 
all  you  wish  to  know  concerning  them.  Good  sealing  weather  is  such  as  we  are  having  while 
I  write  this — a  south  wind,  heavy  fog  &  occasional  showers  of  rain.  From  the  first  of  April 
until  the  middle  of  June  there  was  no  rain  of  consequence  and  there  was  much  fear  the  Co. 
would  not  be  able  to  secure  the  desired  number  of  skins.  Two  months  &  a  half  of  bright 
sunshiny  weather  has  been  heretofore  unknown  on  these  islands.  The  seals  will  not  haul 
up  much  on  the  rookeries  unless  it  is  foggy  and  cloudy  &  they  cannot  be  skinned  in  the 
sunshine  as  a  few  minutes  of  the  suns’  rays  upon  them  causes  the  fur  to  become  loose.  They 
are  a  very  pretty  animal  and  on  our  return  we  hope  to  be  able  to  show  you  specimens  of  the 
pup  and  the  one  year  old.  Mac  has  already  secured  the  former  and  skinned  it.  It  makes  a 
pretty  specimen. 

Our  house  has  a  large  sitting-room  with  small  office  at  one  end  separated  by  folding  doors, 
two  good-sized  sleeping-rooms  with  closets,  a  front  and  back  entry,  back  store-room  and  a 
good  sized  attic.  For  furniture  we  have  a  fine  large  lounge,  plenty  of  cane-seat  chairs,  a  nice 
little  rocker  for  me,  a  fine  writing-desk,  table  and  chairs.  Our  chamber  furniture  is  cheap, 
but  the  bedding  is  excellent.  Hair  mattress  and  springs,  and  plenty  of  blankets.  The  A.C. 

Co.,  sent  up  when  I  came  a  fine  Wheeler  and  Wilson  sewing-machine,  which  I  am  to  have 
the  use  of  while  here.  Shall  endeavor  to  make  good  use  of  it  for  the  benefit  of  their  agents. 

I  have  done  for  myself  and  others  a  great  deal  of  sewing  of  various  kinds  since  I  came. 

There  having  been  none  but  gentlemen  here  to  look  after  things,  a  lady’s  supervision  and 
assistance  was  greatly  needed.  Mr.  Falconer  the  gentleman  who  has  been  occupying  our 
house,  has  kept  it  very  neat  however. 

During  the  summer  season  at  least  we  all  are  very  busy.  For  the  gentlemen,  there  is  the 
sealing  and  egging,  loading  and  unloading  of  the  Steamer  two  or  three  times  during  the 
season,  the  store  to  look  after,  carpenter  work  to  be  done,  etc,  etc.  For  me,  I  have  some  little 
housework,  sewing,  reading,  study  of  Russian,  etc.  I  have  a  nice  guitar.  I  am  learning  to  play 
some  of  it.  It  is  quite  a  comfort  as  I  have  no  piano.  Mac  and  1  are  making  very  fair  progress 
in  our  study  of  Russian.  We  do  not  expect  to  ever  speak  it  fluently  or  very  correctly,  but 
would  like  to  be  able  to  converse  freely  with  the  natives. 

The  women  and  children  frequently  call  at  the  house.  They  will  sit  for  a  while,  look  about 
them,  watch  with  much  interest  whatever  I  am  doing  &  then  go,  no  conversation  having 
been  carried  on  between  us.  They  are  always  quiet  and  respectful. 

This  winter  I  am  going  to  have  put  upon  my  sleeping-room  a  small  stove  with  place  on  top 
to  heat  water,  etc,  so  that  when  the  weather  is  severe,  we  need  not  depend  wholly  upon 
the  large  sitting-room  stove  for  warmth  and  comfort.  I  have  no  doubt  that  we  shall  pass  a 
very  comfortable  winter,  although  we  shall  be  looking  forward  with  much  anxiety  for  the 
steamer’s  arrival  in  the  spring  with  news  of  our  friends.  May  it  be  only  good,  cheering  news 
after  nine  or  ten  long  months  of  silence  and  expectation.86

Genealogy 

Hamden  Wallace  McIntyre88  was  born  at  Randolph,  Vermont,  September  28,  1834.  His 
father,  James  McIntyre,  was  a  native  of  Vermont,  as  was  his  mother,  Charlotte  (Blodgett) 
McIntyre,  whose  ancestry  can  be  traced  to  Connecticut.  Hamden’s  paternal  ances¬ 
tors  were  Scots.  Hamden  spent  his  boyhood  on  his  father’s  Randolph  farm.  Hamden’s 
brothers  were  Benjamin  and  Hugh  Henry,  who  also  worked  in  the  Pribilof  Islands.  “Mr. 
McIntyre  was  joined  in  marriage  at  Elmira,  New  York,  in  November  1859,  with  Miss 
Susan  H.  Johnson,  a  native  of  Maine.  They  had  two  children.”89  Hamden  died  at  Randolph,

Biographical  Sketch 

Captain  Hamden  W.  McIntyre 

The  gentleman  who  is  most  concerned  in  this  biographical  sketch  is  a  man  whose  modesty 
is  scarcely  less  marked  than  his  ability.  He  is  in  the  prime  of  life,  uncommonly  tall  and  in 
bearing,  a  courteous  gentleman  . . . 

He  was  educated  in  his  native  State,  at  an  Orange  County  [Vermont]  grammar  school, 
working  and  teaching  school  between  times  to  pay  his  tuition.  At  the  age  of  twenty  years, 
he  learned  the  trade  of  piano  and  organ  maker.  In  1857,  he  went  to  Canada,  where  he 
became  the  superintendent  of  a  lumber  firm,  near  Ottawa,  and  remained  three  years  in 
their  employ.  In  1860,  he  returned  to  Elmira,  New  York,  and  engaged  in  the  manufacturing 
of  machinery. . . .  On  the  breaking  out  of  the  [Civil]  war,  he  left  his  business  under  the 
management  of  his  foreman  and  went  to  Washington,  District  of  Columbia,  where  he  was 
appointed  as  an  engineer  in  the  navy  yard,  remaining  there  employed  in  the  adjustment  of 
gunboat  machinery  until  1865,  when  he  enlisted  in  the  First  New  York  Veteran  Cavalry,  and 
was  discharged  the  same  year  near  Charleston,  South  Carolina;  then  he  returned  to  Elmira 
and  conducted  his  manufacturing  business  [until  1870]. 

Mr.  McIntyre’s  favorite  studies  have  been  chemistry  and  mathematics,  the  former  being 
first  in  his  regard.  His  bent  of  mind  in  this  direction  led  him  doubtless  to  the  study 
of  fermentation  and  practical  wine-making  at  the  cellars  of  the  Pleasant  Valley  Wine 
Company  in  New  York,  simply  as  a  pastime  during  a  period  of  idleness  enforced  by  ill- 
health^]  [Further]91  and  broader  reading  and  study  of  this  and  kindred  subjects  followed, 
during  the  long  winter  nights  of  a  ten-years  residence  in  Alaska,  where  he  was  agent  at  St. 

Paul’s  Island  for  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company. 

In  1881  he  commenced  wine  making  in  California  at  Captain  Niebaum’s  Inglenook  Winery 
in  Napa  County,  remaining  there  until  1887,  when  he  came  to  Vina  and  took  entire  charge 
of  the  vineyard  and  winery  of  Leland  Stanford.  He  is  a  master  of  civil  and  mechanical 
engineering.  The  winery  building[s]  at  Vina,  with  the  exception  of  the  old  fermenting 
house,  were  constructed  from  his  designs  and  under  his  personal  supervision,  and  many  of 
the  leading  wineries  of  the  State  have  also  been  constructed  from  his  designs  in  whole  or  in 
part,  or  from  his  plans  and  drawings  in  full.  Among  them  may  be  mentioned  the  Inglenook 
Winery  at  Rutherford,  Bourne  &  Wise’s  at  St.  Helena,  M.M.  Estee’s  at  Napa,  Mrs.  Collins’  at 
Mountain  View,  John  Burson’s  at  Oakville,  Goodman  &  Co.’s  at  Oak  Knoll,  near  Napa  City, 

C.P.  Adamson’s  and  Ewer  &  Atkinson’s  at  Rutherford,  Leland  Stanford’s  at  Menlo  Park  and 
the  late  John  A.  Paxton’s  at  Santa  Rosa.92

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Hamden  McIntyre  worked  as  an  engineer  for  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  on  St. 
Paul  Island.  The  Agent’s  Log  credited  him  with  engineering  the  construction  of  the  fol¬ 
lowing  buildings  on  St.  Paul  from  1872  to  1880:  1872 — Government  House,  store  house, 
Point  Warehouse,  four  Native  dwellings;  1873 — new  church  completed;  1875 — twelve 
new  Native  homes  built,  six  in  progress;  1879 — salt  house;  1880 — telephone  line  instal¬ 
lation.  Regarding  the  telephone  line,  Agent’s  Log  entries  read:  “Telephone  completed  to 
N.E.  Point  at  4  p.m.,  and  communication  had  a  perfect  success,”93  and  “The  Company 
[ACC]  has  constructed  a  telephone  line  connecting  St.  Paul  Village  with  the  Northeast 
Point  of  the  island,  where  the  largest  rookery  is  located.”94 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition: 

Hamden  McIntyre  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  May  16,  1892,  before 
Notary  Public  R.  Hilderbrandt  in  the  County  of  Tehama,  California.  The  following  ex¬ 
cerpts  were  taken  from  that  deposition: 

I  am  an  American  citizen,  a  native  of  the  State  of  Vermont;  my  age  is  57  years;  I  am  a 
resident  of  Vina,  Tehama  County,  California,  and  by  occupation  General  Manager  of 
Senator  Leland  Stanford’s  Vina  ranch  and  Palo  Alto  Vineyard.  In  the  year  1871, 1  entered 
the  service  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  and  was  assigned  to  duty  at  the  Pribilof 
group  of  islands  in  Bering  Sea,  first  in  the  capacity  of  chief  mechanic  and  later  as  resident 
Agent  in  charge  of  the  island  of  St.  Paul. 

I  left  San  Francisco  for  Alaska  early  in  April  of  1871,  and  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  about  the 
beginning  of  May  the  same  year,  on  which  island  I  resided  continuously  until  the  close  of 
the  sealing  season  of  the  year  1881,  leaving  there  in  the  month  of  August,  except  that  I  was 
absent  on  leave  during  a  portion  of  the  winter  season  in  1874,  1877,  and  1880. . . . 

Under  personal  instruction  from  the  late  Senator  John  F.  Miller,  then  president  of  the 
Alaska  Commercial  Company,  I  made  a  series  of  observations  in  order  to  determine 
as  nearly  as  practicable  the  area  of  ground  occupied  by  the  seals,  and  incidentally  their 
number,  approximately,  during  the  season  of  1871  for  the  purpose  of  noting  the  changes 
which  might  occur  from  year  to  year. 

I  was  enabled  from  the  observations  so  made  to  make  a  chart  or  map  having  upon  it 
bearing  and  distances,  the  whole  of  which  were  verified  by  Lieut.  Washburn  Maynard,  of 
the  U.S.  Navy,95  slight  differences  in  our  measurements  and  observations  only  being  noted.” 

The  erection  of  “salt  houses”  at  suitable  places  for  curing  the  sealskins  was  one  of  the 
earliest  works  undertaken,  and  several  were  erected  at  points  convenient  to  the  largest 
“hauling  grounds.”  In  addition  to  this,  teams  were  furnished  and  skins  hauled  to  the  salting 
places  or,  in  other  instances,  they  were  taken  by  boats  as  most  convenient. 

In  this  manner  the  necessity  for  long  drives  was  obviated  and  the  work  made  easier  in  all 
respects. 

I  have  also  no  doubt  as  to  the  final  result  of  this  indiscriminate  [pelagic]  sealing.  The  dense 
fogs  which  prevail  over  Bering  Sea  in  summer  render  the  drawing  of  an  imaginary  line  of 
protection  about  the  seal  islands  absolutely  futile  and  inoperative  for  such  purpose;  and 
unless  full  protection  is  afforded  the  animals,  their  extermination  must  follow  as  surely  as 
in  the  case  of  the  seals  at  the  South  Shetland  Islands,  or  the  buffalo  on  the  plains  on  North 
America.96

Benjamin  and  Hamden,  who  also  worked  at  the  Pribilof  Islands  (see  Hamden  McIntyre 
and  Benjamin  McIntyre  biographies). 


Biographical  Sketch 

The  following  biographic  material  for  Dr.  Hugh  H.  McIntyre  is  taken  from  the  1895  The 
Illustrated  Historical  Souvenir  of  Randolph,  Vermont,  by  Nickerson  and  Cox. 

Hugh  H.  McIntyre  was  reared  on  his  father’s  farm  and  educated  at  Edward  Conant’s 
school  at  Randolph  Center.  He  enlisted  in  the  10th  Vt.  Vols.  in  August,  1862,  before  he 
was  eighteen  years  old,  served  one  year  with  his  regiment,  and  was  then  transferred  to 
the  U.S.  regular  army  Signal  Corps,  where  he  continued  with  the  Army  of  the  Potomac 
until  the  close  of  the  war.  He  was  employed  as  clerk  in  the  office  of  the  Secretary  of  the 
Treasury  from  1866  to  1868,  and  as  Special  Treasury  Agent  for  Alaska  from  1868-1870.  He 
installed  the  first  Collector  of  Customs  in  that  territory  and  reported  on  the  seal  fisheries 
of  Bering  Sea  in  1869.  He  left  the  Treasury  Department  in  1870  to  accept  the  position  of 
superintendent  of  the  seal  fisheries  for  the  lessees,  and  had  active  charge  and  management 
of  them  from  this  time  until  1890;  and  was  again  employed  by  the  government  as  agent  of 
the  State  Department  in  1892,  in  preparing  evidence  concerning  the  same  to  be  used  before 
the  international  board  of  arbitration  in  Paris  in  1893.  Dr.  McIntyre  studied  medicine  and 
graduated  from  the  medical  department  of  Georgetown  College  in  1868,  and  studied  law  in 
the  Boston  University  in  1875-1876." 

In  1899,  Hugh  McIntyre  graduated  from  the  American  School  of  Osteopathy, 
Kirksville,  Missouri,  and  in  1900,  he  studied  at  the  Post  Graduate  Medical  College,  New 
York  City.100 


Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Dr.  Hugh  McIntyre  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  at  least  seven  times  in  1892 
(March  31,  April  5,  May  6,  May  12,  July  28,  and  twice  on  August  l),101  providing  his  per¬ 
spective  on  sealing  at  the  Pribilof  Islands.  In  his  sworn  testimony  on  March  31,  1892,  he 
stated: 

I  went  to  that  Territory  in  1868  as  special  Treasury  agent ...  to  report  what  action  was 
necessary  to  be  taken  by  the  Government  for  preserving  the  seal  rookeries  and  securing 
a  revenue  therefrom.  I  arrived  at  Sitka  in  November  1868,  remained  there  a  few  days  and 
went  thence  to  Victoria,  British  Columbia,  touching  at  all  principal  points  between  Sitka 
and  Victoria,  spending  the  entire  winter  of  1868  and  1869  among  the  Indians  and  fur

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


traders,  learning  their  traditions  and  customs,  and  noting  their  catches  of  furs  and  manner 
of  doing  business.  It  came  to  my  knowledge  at  that  time  that  a  considerable  number  of  fur- 
seals  were  being  killed  by  the  Indians,  mostly  by  the  use  of  spears,  in  the  waters  adjacent 
to  Vancouver’s  and  Queen  Charlotte’s  islands  [sic].  The  total  catch  obtained  in  this  way 
amounted  at  this  time  ...  to  3,000  to  5,000  skins  per  annum. ...  In  the  spring  of  1869,  I 
joined  the  United  States  revenue  steamer  Lincoln,  and  made  the  summer’s  cruise  in  her  of 
about  four  months,  touching  at  many  points  along  the  Alaska  coast  between  Sitka  and  the 
most  westerly  island  of  the  Aleutian  Archipelago,  visiting  the  Pribilof  group  twice  during 
the  season.102 

On  May  12,  1892,  Dr.  McIntyre  offered  additional  comments  to  his  testimony: 

I  returned  to  Washington,  D.C.,  in  November  1869,  and  was  placed  in  charge  of  work 
during  the  following  winter  and  spring  pertaining  to  Alaska  and  the  sealeries,  in  the  office 
of  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury. 

In  June,  1869, 103  1  accepted  the  position  of  general  agent  of  the  Alaska  Commercial 
Company,  and  in  the  following  August,  when  the  lease  of  the  right  to  take  seals  was 
executed,  I  became  superintendent  of  seal  fisheries  for  the  lessees,  and  remained  in  this 
position  until  the  spring  of  1890. 

And  on  July  28,  1892: 

As  superintendent  of  the  seal  fisheries  [for  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company]  I  visited

until  1889,  inclusive,  excepting  1883,  1884  and  1885.  I  usually  remained  on  the  islands

catch,  examining  the  conditions  of  seal  life,  studying  the  habits  of  the  seals,  and,  in  brief, 
doing  such  work  as  the  interests  of  the  lessees  seemed  to  demand.  I  also  went  twice  to 
London,  first  in  1872,  and  again  in  1886,  to  attend  the  fur  seal  trade  sales  with  a  view  to 
becoming  more  thoroughly  acquainted  with  the  demands  of  the  sealskin  market.  My  duties 
as  such  special  Treasury  agent  and  superintendent  demanded  and  received  my  attention 
to  every  detail  of  seal  life  and  its  relation  to  commerce.  In  the  execution  of  these  duties 
I  was  constantly  aided  by  able,  intelligent  assistants  and  native  seal  hunters,  whose  daily 
observations  and  reports  were  from  time  to  time  communicated  to  me.104 

The  work  of  seal  killing  is  done  by  the  Aleutian  inhabitants  of  the  seal  islands  under  the 
immediate  supervision  of  the  superintendent  for  the  lessees  and  his  assistants.  The  natives 
are  directed  by  their  chiefs,  who  are  either  chosen  by  themselves  or  appointed  by  the 
Treasury  agent  in  charge.  The  force  of  natives  is  divided  into  gangs  of  20  to  30  men,  each 
gang  being  led  by  an  assistant  superintendent  and  native  chief,  and  comprise  the  proper 
number  of  "clubbers,”  “rippers,”  and  “skinners.”105 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

David  Starr  Jordan,  and  others  as  a  consequence,  erroneously  characterized  Dr.  Hugh 
McIntyre’s  journey  to  and  role  at  the  Pribilof  Islands  as  a  special  Treasury  agent  in  1869. 
Dr.  McIntyre’s  testimonies  above  should  clarify  the  record.  Jordan  wrote: 

In  the  spring  of  1869,  Dr.  H.H.  McIntyre,  the  representative  of  the  United  States 
Government,  landed  upon  the  island,  establishing  the  authority  of  the  Government,  and 
taking  the  necessary  steps  for  the  protection  of  the  rookeries. 

The  period  of  lawlessness  which  marked  the  season  of  1868  was  thus  terminated  in  1869  by 
Dr.  McIntyre.  He  was  appointed  in  1868  and  endeavored  to  reach  his  destination  in  the  fall 
of  that  year,  but  on  account  of  the  lateness  of  the  season  he  was  forced  to  winter  at  Sitka.106 

On  the  contrary,  according  to  McIntyre’s  testimony  to  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration 
presented  previously,  McIntyre  worked  in  Washington,  D.C.  for  the  Secretary  of  the 
Treasury.  Then  in  June  1869,  McIntyre  took  a  position  as  a  general  agent  for  the  ACC. 
It  was  Captain  Charles  Bryant,  also  a  special  Treasury  agent,  rather  than  Dr.  McIntyre, 
who  served  with  principal  civil  authority  over  the  Pribilof  Islands  beginning  in  1869  (see 
Charles  Bryant  and  Henry  Wood  Elliott  biographies). 

Beginning  in  1871  and,  as  best  known,  ending  in  1872,  Hugh  McIntyre  took  the  first 
known  stereographic  photographs  on  the  Pribilof  Islands.10  “Could  you  but  know  the 
difficulties  under  which  they  [photographs]  were  produced,”  he  wrote,  “you  would  pro¬ 
nounce  them  good  however  bad  they  may  be.  The  weather  does  not  allow  me  to  work 
more  than  one  day  in  two  weeks.”  About  taking  pictures  of  fur  seals,  which  is  no  less 
challenging  today,  he  recalled,  “In  1872,  I  carried  a  photographer’s  camera  near  the  .  .  . 
rookery  on  St.  Paul  Island,  and  while  focusing  the  instrument  with  my  head  under  the 
black  cloth,  and  the  attention  of  my  attendant  was  diverted,  two  old  bulls  made  a  savage 
attack  upon  me,  which  I  avoided  by  dodging  and  running.  The  camera  was  left  where  I 
had  placed  it  and  could  not  be  recovered  until  seal  clubs  had  been  sent  for  and  one  of  the 
bulls  killed  and  the  other  knocked  down  and  stunned.” 

Emma  McIntyre  wrote  several  letters  to  family  members  in  Vermont  during  her  resi¬ 
dence  on  St.  Paul  Island.  These  personal  writings  offer  interesting  vignettes  into  life  and 
notable  personages  on  the  island  at  the  time.  The  following  was  collected  for  a  presenta¬ 
tion  by  Alaska  historian  Robert  E.  King:

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Mr.  [Henry  Wood]  Elliott  is  quite  a  young  man  and  exceedingly  free  in  his  manners. 

Was  at  his  ease  the  moment  he  entered  the  house.  As  far  as  we  can  judge  by  one  day’s 
acquaintance  he  will  be  a  very  pleasant  addition.  He  is  quite  a  genius.  He  has  been 
sketching  on  his  trip  out.  He  made  a  few  sketches  at  Ounalaska  and  this  morning  was 
making  duplicates  on  small  cards  to  send  back.  He  painted  in  water  colors  three  of  them  in 
an  hour  or  two.  Splendidly  done  too.  I  was  surprised.  They  are  very  nicely  executed  and  so 
natural  that  I  recognized  everything.  He  is  a  naturalist  and  will  get  all  sorts  of  specimens 
here.  Is  stirring  early  in  the  morning  he  says.  In  fact  seems  to  be  a  wide-awake  jovial 
Yankee.  [April  26,  1871] 109 

Emma  McIntyre  wrote  less  kindly  about  Captain  Charles  Bryant,  St.  Paul  Island 
Treasury  Agent-in-Charge,  with  whom  they  shared  a  residence.  She  referred  to  him  as 
“the  conceited  old  goose,”  and  “such  a  boor  we  have  to  curb  personal  dislike  in  order  to 
be  very  sweet  for  him,  but  he  brings  his  wife  which  I  think  will  in  great  measure  abate  our 
trouble  with  him.”  She  followed  that  statement  with,  “She  keeps  him  decently  tidy  and 
orders  him  around  a  little  I  think.”110 

H.  H.  McIntyre  took  excerpts  from  the  log  book  of  Captain  Alfred  N.  Tulles,  of  the 
schooner  Angel  Dolly ,  and  presented  them  as  a  witness  before  “the  House  Committee 
on  Merchant  Marine  and  Fisheries,  Fiftieth  Congress,  second  session,  report  No.  3883.” 
Treasury  Agent  George  R.  Tingle  had  seized  the  vessel  for  violation  of  the  revenue  laws 
on  July  28,  1887,  near  Otter  Island.  Capt.  Tulles  was  reportedly  accidentally  killed  by  his 
own  hand  on  that  day.  The  following  excerpts  represent  most  but  not  all  of  McIntyre’s 
presentation: 

July  4,  1887.— Hove  to  30  miles  southwest  of  St.  George  island.  At  1.30  out  boats.  Got  5 
seals. 

July  5,  1887. — Out  boats  at  6.30  a.m.  Returned  at  11.15  p.m.  with  11  seals,  one  boat  getting 

6. 

July  9,  1887. — I  am  not  on  the  hunting  ground,  but  keep  sail  on  the  vessel  as  we  may  pick 
up  a  sleeping  seal. 

July  11,  1887. — Caught  7  seals. 

July  13,  1887.— Caught  12  seals;  they  were  around  the  vessel  as  thick  as  bees  (the  seal).  Had 
it  been  clear  we  would  have  caught  100  easy. 

July  16,  1887.— Saw  3  sleeping  seals  from  the  vessel.  Got  boat  over  and  got  them.  I  have  not 
seen  the  sun  for  nine  days,  therefore  I  have  had  no  observations,  yet  I  know  that  I  am  not 
over  14  miles  from  St.  George  Island. 

July  17,  1887. — Out  boats  at  10.30.  a.m.  the  seals  around  the  vessel  in  hundreds.  The  boats 
would  not  go  any  distance  from  the  vessel.  Had  they  gone  away  they  could  have  caught  200 
or  300  seals.  They  were  afraid  of  the  fog,  yet  I  told  them  that  it  would  clear  up,  which  it  did 
at  3.30  p.  m.,  and  continued  thus  all  the  rest  of  the  day.  They  are  the  hardest  set  of  hunters 
that  were  ever  in  Bering  Sea,  who  caught  20  seals  and  used  250  rounds  of  ammunition. 

They  get  1  out  of  10  they  fire  at.  Well,  I  will  never  be  caught  with  such  a  crowd  again.  The 
head  hunter  fired  100  shells  and  got  6  seals.  The  vessel  is  lying  between  the  islands  of  St. 

Paul  and  St.  George.  Just  as  soon  as  the  fog  clears  off  the  land  I  will  have  to  move,  as  I 
might  have  the  cutter  after  me.  I  came  here  to  get  a  load  of  seals,  and  by  God,  if  I  had  any 
men  with  me,  I  would  get  them,  too.  They  are  all  a  set  of  curs,  genuine  one,  too. 

July  21,  1887. — Out  boats  at  6.30  a.m.,  coming  back  to  vessel  at  9  p.m.  One  boat  returned 
at  7  p.m.  This  was  the  head  hunter.  He  is  out  last  and  first  back  as  always.  Caught  30  seals; 
one  boat  got  14.  This  is  the  best  day’s  work  we  have  done  yet.  From  the  amount  of  growling 
among  the  boat  pullers  I  conclude  that  they  fired  at  and  missed  nearly  200  seals.  They  had 
100  loaded  shells  each  when  they  left  the  ship,  and  when  they  came  back  all  were  emptied, 
so  they  did  some  tall  firing.

July  23,  1887. — To-day  I  asl<ed  Daniel  McCue,  boat  puller  for  Charles  Loderstrom,  how 
it  was  that  his  boat  got  only  9  seals.  I  told  him  that  I  had  seen  40  sleeping  seals  from  the 
vessel,  and  that  he  must  have  seen  more  as  he  was  pulling  about.  His  answer  was  that  if 
he  had  a  man  that  knew  how  to  shoot,  that  the  boat  could  not  carry  all  the  seals  that  were 
missed.  “Why,  Captain,”  he  said,  “it  is  enough  to  discourage  a  man.  You  pull  up  to  a  sleeping 
seal  to  within  10  feet,  fire  at  him  and  see  the  shot  go  6  feet  the  other  side  of  him.”  I  then 
asked  J.  Linquist,  puller  for  boat  two.  He  said:  “Captain,  don’t  ask  me  how  many  we  have 
seen,  but  ask  me  how  many  we  missed,  and  I  will  tell  you.”  I  asked  him  the  above  question; 
he  said  100. 1  now  asked  Joe  Spooner  the  same  questions  as  above;  his  answer  was,  “We 
only  want  hunters,  and  we  would  be  going  home  now  with  1,500  skins  at  the  very  least.” 

July  24,  1887. — As  fine  a  day  as  was  ever  in  San  Francisco.  A  flat  calm  with  the  sea  smooth 
as  glass.  Got  out  the  boats  at  6.30  p.m.,  coming  back  at  7.30  with  14  seals.  Why,  one  boat 
with  an  ordinary  hunter  could  get  that  many  without  going  100  yards  from  the  ship.  I  killed 
2  inside  of  ten  minutes,  and  it  was  then  nearly  dark. 

July  25,  1887. — Nice  weather.  Out  boats  at  7  p.m.  Came  back  with  4  seals.  Big  catch. 

July  26,  1887. — There  were  thousands  of  seals  around  the  vessel.  I  shot  and  killed  7  from 
the  vessel,  but  only  got  1,  through  the  tardiness  of  the  hunters.  At  4.30  I  put  the  boats  out; 
came  back  at  7.30  with  1  seal.  The  water  was  fairly  covered  with  seals,  yet  they  only  caught 
1. 


The  log  closes  on  the  28  th  of  July,  1887,  on  which  day  the  captain  was  killed  and  his  vessel 
seized  for  violation  of  revenue  laws. 

His  signals  were:  (1)  come  back  to  the  vessel;  (2)  want  a  boat  for  dead  seals;  (3)  keep  near  the 
vessel;  bad  weather  or  fog;  (4)  cutter  in  sight.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

William  McIntyre  arrived  at  St.  George  Island  on  May  11, 1874,  with  his  wife,  Emma,  who 
was  seven  months  pregnant. 

In  the  absence  of  Agent  Samuel  Falconer,  McIntyre  assumed  charge  of  St.  George 
Island  during  the  winter  months  of  1874-1875.  A  month  after  the  birth  of  Margarite, 
William  McIntyre  dealt  with  pelagic  sealers  working  from  the  schooner  Cygnet  sailing  out 
of  Santa  Barbara,  California.  He  reported  the  incident  March  15, 1875,  to  the  Secretary  of 
the  Treasury  as  part  of  his  1874  yearly  report. 

Sir:  On  the  1st  of  September  last,  the  natives  reported  that  the  crew  of  the  otter-hunting 
schooner  Cygnet  were  shooting  seals  from  the  deck  of  the  vessel,  as  she  lay  at  anchor  in 
Zapadnee  Bay,  five  miles  from  the  village.  When  a  seal  was  killed  they  would  lower  a  boat, 
take  it  on  board,  and,  after  skinning  it,  would  throw  the  carcass  overboard.  I  immediately 
sent  a  party  of  natives  to  watch  the  Cygnet,  and  ascertain,  if  possible,  how  many  seals  were 
killed,  and  also  sent  a  letter  to  the  captain  of  the  vessel,  informing  him  that  his  actions  were 
illegal  and  that  he  must  leave  these  shores  at  once.  As  there  were  no  boats  on  the  south  side 
of  the  island,  signals  were  made  for  a  boat  from  the  Cygnet  to  come  ashore. 

The  next  day  the  natives  informed  me  that  the  signals  were  unanswered  and  that  no 
communication  was  had  with  the  vessel;  that  the  crew  had  lowered  two  boats,  and  were 
killing  seals  in  the  water,  under  the  cliff  near  the  rookery,  and  that  the  seals  were  evidently 
much  alarmed,  as  they  were  leaving  the  breeding  and  hauling  grounds,  and  were  taking  to 
the  water  in  great  numbers.  A  heavy  sea  was  running  on  the  north  side  of  the  island,  and 
the  breakers  rendered  it  extremely  hazardous  to  launch  the  whale-boat  and  sail  around 
the  island  to  South-west  Bay,  and,  as  the  natives  are  poor  sailors,  I  did  not  deem  it  prudent 
to  make  the  attempt.  Still,  I  wished  to  give  the  captain  of  the  vessel  timely  warning  before 
proceeding  to  any  harsh  measures.  (I  had  armed  the  natives,  with  the  intention  of  repelling 
by  force  any  attempts  to  kill  seals  on  the  rookeries  or  within  rifle-shot  of  the  shore,  if 
the  crew  still  persisted  in  doing  so  after  the  receipt  of  my  letter  by  the  captain.)  I  had  the 
natives  carry  one  of  their  bydarkies  across  the  island  to  Zapadnee  and  sent  the  letter  before 
referred  to,  and  also  requested  an  interview  with  the  captain  on  the  beach,  which  he  at 
once  granted. 

Captain  Kimberly  was  very  much  astonished  when  informed  that  he  was  violating  the  laws 
of  the  United  States;  acknowledged  that  he  had  been  killing  seals,  but  maintained  that  the 
jurisdiction  of  the  Government  did  not  extend  to  the  waters  of  Behring  Sea,  but  only  over 
the  Pribyloff  Islands.  I  informed  him  that  the  phraseology  of  the  act  approved  July  1,  1870, 
was  quite  plain  and  there  was  no  mistaking  its  meaning;  that  the  second  section  of  said  act 
provides  ***  “that  it  shall  be  unlawful  to  kill  any  seal  in  the  water  adjacent  to  said  islands, 
or  on  the  beaches,  cliffs,  or  rocks  where  they  haul  up  from  the  sea  to  remain;  and  any 
person  who  shall  violate  either  of  the  provisions  of  this  or  the  first  section  of  this  act  shall 
be  punished,  on  conviction  thereof,  for  each  offense  by  a  fine  of  not  less  than  two  hundred 
dollars  nor  more  than  one  thousand  dollars,  or  by  imprisonment  not  exceeding  six  months, 
or  by  such  fine  and  imprisonment  both,  at  the  discretion  of  the  court  having  jurisdiction 
and  taking  cognizance  of  the  offense;  and  all  vessels,  their  tackle,  apparel,  and  furniture, 
whose  crew  shall  be  found  engaged  in  the  violation  of  any  of  the  provisions  of  this  act,  shall 
be  forfeited  to  the  United  States.” 

He  replied  that,  if  that  was  the  law,  of  course  he  had  violated  it,  but  had  done  so  innocently; 
that  he  was  engaged  in  otter-hunting,  and  had  at  that  time  two  hundred  skins  on  board; 
that  he  was  looking  for  a  kelp-patch  to  the  west  of  the  island,  where  he  expected  to  find 
otter  in  abundance,  and  was  only  waiting  for  calm  weather,  so  that  he  could  hunt  them  in 
small  boats,  and  that  he  had  not  fitted  out  for  any  purpose  other  than  otter-hunting.  In 
reply  to  the  inquiry  as  to  why  he  had  not  answered  my  signals  and  sent  a  boat  ashore,  he 
replied  that  he  supposed  they  were  made  by  the  natives,  prompted  either  by  motives  of

trade  or  curiosity,  and  therefore  paid  no  attention  to  them;  had  he  known  that  they  were 
made  by  white  men  he  should  have  sent  a  boat  ashore  at  once. 

I  informed  Captain  Kimberly  that  he  must  return  to  me  the  skins  of  all  the  seals  he  had 
killed  and  leave  the  shores  of  this  island  at  once.  The  natives  reported  that  he  had  killed 
thirty-four  seals,  but  Captain  Kimberly  said  that  he  had  killed  thirty-five,  and  would 
bring  them  ashore  at  once,  which  he  did.  These  skins  I  salted  and  stored  in  the  company’s 
magazine  at  Zapadnee,  where  I  supposed  they  would  be  perfectly  safe;  but  the  foxes 
effected  an  entrance  into  the  salt-house  by  digging  under  the  floor  and  destroyed  every  one 
of  them.  It  may  be  proper,  however,  to  state  that  these  skins  were  deemed  stagey  by  the 
company  s  agent,  or  I  should  have  turned  them  in  to  the  company,  to  be  included  in  this 
year’s  quota.  The  Cygnet  left  that  same  afternoon,  September  2,  1874,  and  has  not  been 
seen  in  these  waters  since.  The  captain’s  full  name  is  Samuel  Kimberly,  and  the  second 
officer’s  Cannon;  the  latter  was  engaged  in  sealing  on  this  island  in  1868.

Assistant  Treasury  Agent,  St.  George,  Alaska  Ter.115 

In  addition  to  his  statement  about  pelagic  sealers,  McIntyre  wrote  about  general  con¬ 
ditions  on  St.  George  during  1874-1875: 

There  has  been  a  great  deal  of  sickness  on  the  island  during  the  past  winter.  At  one  time 
it  seemed  as  if  every  one  on  the  village  was  down  with  sickness.  From  the  8th  of  August 
up  to  the  date  of  this  report  [March  1875]  there  have  been  nine  deaths  and  only  four 
births.  Among  the  deaths  three  were  grown  people  and  the  remainder  were  children.  Only 
one  accident  occurred  during  the  winter,  and  that  was  occasioned  through  carelessness 
in  handling  a  gun,  the  charge  of  which  passed  through  the  native’s  hand,  necessitating 
amputation  at  the  wrist. . . .  The  school  has  been  kept  open  in  accordance  with  law; 
the  average  daily  attendance  was  eleven,  and  the  progress  of  the  scholars  has  been  very 
flattering. ...  I  have  had  the  Government  house  thoroughly,  cleaned,  papered,  and  painted 
both  inside  and  out  with  two  coats;  the  inside  I  painted  white  and  the  outside  a  very  pretty 
brown,  with  white  trimmings.  I  have  also  painted  the  fence  a  light  brown.  In  the  fall  I 
banked  the  foundations  up  to  the  woodwork.  A  new  floor  is  necessary  for  the  office  and 
large  rooms;  the  old  floor  is  badly  worn,  and  has  shrunk  a  great  deal,  and  I  have  to  request 
that  you  authorize  me  to  put  down  a  new  floor  during  the  fall  or  winter;  a  new  stove  is  also 
wanted,  and  a  new  carpet  and  double  bedstead;  these  are  the  only  additional  improvements 
necessary  at  present.  I  considered  the  repairs  made  this  spring  absolutely  necessary  for 
the  proper  preservation  of  the  property.  The  following  is  the  meteorological  record  for  the

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Agent  Charles  Bryant  objected  to  Assistant  Agent  William  McIntyre’s  renovations 
to  the  Treasury  agent’s  house  and  fence  on  St.  George  Island,  since  he  had  not  been  au¬ 
thorized  to  spend  funds  for  that  purpose.  Although  Bryant  was  satisfied  with  McIntyre’s 
overall  management  of  St.  George  Island,  he  had  received  complaints  about  McIntyre’s 
treatment  of  a  Native’s  eight-year-old  son  who  failed  to  attend  the  English  school.  The 
boy’s  father  wanted  to  instruct  his  son  in  Russian  at  home  rather  than  sending  him  to  the 
English  school.117 

Assistant  Agent  William  McIntyre  was  assigned  to  St.  Paul  Island  for  the  winter 
months  of  1875-76  and  worked  with  Agent  George  Marston,  who  stepped  in  when 
Charles  Bryant  suddenly  departed  the  island,  with  some  minor  adversarial  incidents  (see 
Marston’s  biography).  McIntyre  returned  to  St.  George  Island  during  the  spring  of  1876, 
and  resigned  from  service  effective  that  fall,  September  30,  1876. 118  He  was  replaced  by 
George  Marston.

Genealogy 

Lee  Carroll  McMillin  was  born  in  Seattle,  Washington,  on  January  31,  1895,  and  was 
educated  in  the  local  schools.  By  1920,  Lee  McMillin  had  married  a  local  woman  named 
Dorothy  (family  name  unknown;  born  1898,  died  1978),  who  accompanied  him  to  the 
Pribilof  Islands.  Lee  McMillin  died  in  Seattle  on  September  5,  1945. 119 

Biographical  Sketch 

When  the  World  War  I  draft  registration  took  place  in  1917,  Lee  McMillin  was  living  in 
Kent,  Washington,  working  as  a  shipping  clerk  for  the  American  Paper  Company.  Since 
the  death  of  his  parents,  he  had  assumed  responsibility  for  raising  his  two  younger  sib¬ 
lings.

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Max  Meilbronner’s  deposition  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  May  6,  1892,  before 
Notary  Public  Clement  Bennett  at  San  Francisco,  California,  is  excerpted  here: 

I  am  secretary  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  and  as  such  have  in  my  custody  all 
record  books  of  the  Company;  and  among  them  the  daily  records  or  “log  book”  kept  by  the 
agents  of  the  Company  on  St.  George  Island  from  1873  to  1889,  inclusive,  and  on  St.  Paul 
Island  from  1876  to  1889,  inclusive. . . .  The  reports  of  the  superintendent  for  the  lessees 
show  that  it  was  the  custom  of  the  Company’s  agents  on  the  islands  to  frequently  patrol 
the  rookeries  whenever  the  weather  was  such  that  a  landing  could  be  effected  on  them,  and 
to  keep  watchmen  at  points  distant  from  the  villages,  whose  special  duty  it  was  to  report 
every  unusual  or  suspicious  occurrence.  For  this  purpose  the  northeast  point  of  St.  Paul 
Island  was  connected  with  the  village  by  telephone  in  1880,  a  distance  of  12  miles,  and  the 
natives  instructed  in  the  use  of  the  instrument.120

Genealogy 

Thomas  Corwin  Mendenhall  was  born  October  4,  1841,  at  Hanoverton,  Ohio,  the  son  of 
Stephan  and  Mary  (Thomas)  Mendenhall.121 

Biographical  Sketch 

Thomas  C.  Mendenhall  grew  up  in  Ohio.  At  the  age  of  sixteen  he  began  to  teach  school  and 
in  1873  became  a  professor  of  physics  and  mechanics  at  Ohio  State  University.  In  1878,  he 
was  a  professor  at  the  Imperial  University  of  Japan  and  Director  of  the  Observatory;  he 
returned  in  1881  to  Ohio  State  as  a  professor  of  physics.  In  1884,  he  joined  the  Weather 
Bureau,  then  within  the  Army  Signal  Corps,  as  a  professor  of  electricity.  In  1888,  President 
Benjamin  Harrison  named  Mendenhall  Superintendent  of  the  U.S.  Coast  and  Geodetic 
Survey.  Mendenhall  became  president  of  Worcester  Polytechnic  Institute,  Worcester, 
Massachusetts,  in  1894.122 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Thomas  C.  Mendenhall  investigated  the  biology  and  ecology  of  the  northern  fur  seal 
as  one  of  several  commissioners  appointed  to  the  Bering  Sea  Commission  by  President 
Benjamin  Harrison.  See  the  biography  of  Clinton  Hart  Merriam  for  additional  informa¬

Merkul’iev,  Vasilii  Petrovich  (d.  1828) 

Manager  of  Pribilof  Islands  Russian- American  Company,  1799-1828  (?) 

Genealogy 

Vasilii  Petrovich  Merkul’iev,  a  burgher  from  Tomsk,  Russia,  married  Ekaterina,  an  Aleut 
woman  possibly  from  Umnak,  on  July  5, 1790.  Ekaterina’s  name  had  been  bestowed  during 
a  lay  baptism.  The  marriage  took  place  at  a  small  settlement,  Shettaq  (or  Sheshtaq),  on 
Kodiak  Island.  Vasilii  and  Ekaterina  had  two  sons,  Dmitrii  and  Iakov.130  “Vasilii  Merkul’iev 
perished  with  other  men  in  1828  when  their  baidara  sank  in  the  perilous  strait  off  of 
Akutan  Island.”131  Professor  Lydia  T.  Black  suggested  that  Vasilii  Merkul’iev  was  the  an¬ 
cestor  to  “several  prominent  Aleut  families  on  both  St.  George  and  St.  Paul  Islands.”132 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Beginning  in  1799,  Vasilii  Merkul’iev  served  as  the  Russian-American  Company’s  first 
Pribilof  Islands  manager.  He  was  partly  responsible  for  bringing  Natives  from  the  Aleutian 
chain  to  live  and  work  on  the  Pribilof  Islands.133  Russian  historian  Kiril  T.  Khlebnikov 
wrote  about  Vasilii  Merkul’iev: 

An  interesting  event  occurred  with  one  detachment  of  Merkul’ev’s  [sic]  artel  in  1799.  They 
were  planning  on  sailing  from  Georgii  Island  to  Pavel  Island  to  hunt  in  a  large  baidara  with 
42  men  on  board.  Soon  after  they  left  the  shore  they  were  covered  by  a  thick  fog  followed 
by  strong  wind  from  the  northwest  which  turned  into  a  bitter  storm.  To  lighten  the  baidara 
they  threw  all  their  property  into  the  sea,  and  with  great  effort,  without  food  or  water,  were 
barely  able  to  hold  on  during  the  storm,  which  lasted  eight  days.  Finally  they  saw  the  coast 
of  North  America  and  landed  there.  The  Aglegmuts  [sic]  who  inhabited  that  place  not  only 
did  not  want  to  give  them  food,  but  seeing  that  they  were  exhausted  and  weak  wanted  to 
attack  and  kill  them.  Under  the  pretext  of  promising  them  food,  they  called  them  to  come 
to  their  settlement,  but  the  Russians  understood  their  intention  and  decided  not  to  give  in 
to  their  false  promise,  which  would  lead  them  to  painful  death,  deciding  it  would  be  better 
to  drown  at  sea. . . .  The  large  baidara  under  sail  quickly  drew  away  from  the  shore,  thereby 
saving  the  travelers  from  death.  Next  day,  weak  and  desperate,  they  reached  Unga  Island 
where  there  were  Russian  artels  of  Shelikhov’s  company.134

Merriam,  Dr.  Clinton  Hart  (1856-1942) 

Naturalist,  Founder  of  U.S.  Biological  Survey 

Bering  Sea  Commissioner,  Fur-Seal  Investigation,  1891-1892 

Genealogy 

Clinton  Hart  Merriam  was  born  December 
5,  1855,  in  New  York  City  to  Clinton  Levi  and 
Caroline  (Hart)  Merriam.  Clinton  Hart  Merriam 
married  Virginia  Elizabeth  Gosnel  of  West 
Virginia  at  Berkeley,  California,  on  October  15, 
1886. 135  Virginia  Merriam  died  in  1937;  Clinton 
Hart  Merriam  died  March  19,  1942,  at  Berkeley, 
California. 


Virgina  and  Clinton  Hart  Merriam  had  two 
daughters.  One  became  Mrs.  Talbot,  whose  hus¬ 
band  served  as  director  of  the  research  branch  of 
the  United  States  Forestry  and  Range  Experiment 
Station  in  California.  The  other  daughter  married 
Henry  Abbott  of  Washington,  D.C.,  the  assistant 
to  the  head  of  the  Soil  Conservation  Service.136

Biographical  Sketch 

Dr.  Clinton  Hart  Merriam’s  remarkable  career  as  a  scientist  began  when  he  was  a  twelve- 
year-old  collecting  insects  and  birds.  He  soon  graduated  to  “reptiles,  marine  invertebrates 
and  plants.”137  Ultimately,  his  exploration  and  collecting  trips  took  him  to  “every  state  in 
the  Union,  Alaska  and  Bermuda.”138  Like  artist  Henry  Wood  Elliott,  Merriam  participated 
in  a  Hayden  Expedition  to  Yellowstone — Merriam  in  1872  at  the  age  of  sixteen,  Elliott  in 
1870.  Both  men  went  on  to  play  important  roles  on  the  Pribilof  Islands. 

After  graduating  from  Sheffield  Scientific  School  at  Yale  in  1877,  Merriam  earned 
a  degree  from  Columbia’s  College  of  Physicians  and  Surgeons.  He  practiced  medicine 
for  six  years,  until  1885,  when  his  irrepressible  scientific  interests  led  him  to  Europe. 
A  summons  to  head  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture’s  Division  of  Ornithology  and 
Mammalogy  (which  became  the  U.S.  Biological  Survey,  and  is  now  the  Fish  and  Wildlife 
Service)  brought  him  back  to  the  states.  After  resigning  from  the  Biological  Survey  in 
1910,  he  became  a  research  associate  at  the  Smithsonian  Institution.  In  1917,  while 
still  working  at  the  Smithsonian,  Merriam  became  the  chairman  of  the  U.S.  Board  on 
Geographic  Names,  and  he  also  embarked  on  an  ethnographic  study  of  Pacific  Coast 
Indians.139  Merriam  produced  an  exceptional  amount  of  written  work  and  is  credited 
with  developing  the  “life  zones”  concept  of  mapping  the  distribution  of  plants  and  ani¬ 
mals — a  significant  contribution  to  the  budding  science  of  ecology.140

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

As  head  of  the  U.S.  Biological  Survey,  C.  Hart  Merriam  was  part  of  a  scientific  team  as¬ 
signed  to  investigate  the  fur-seal  question  in  preparation  for  the  U.S.  position  before  the 
1893  International  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  convened  at  Paris,  France.  Other  team  mem¬ 
bers  included  Joseph  Stanley-Brown  and  Thomas  C.  Mendenhall.  They  sailed  aboard  the 
U.S.  Fish  Commission’s  Albatross  and  visited  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  July  and  August  1891; 
Merriman  also  studied  the  plants  of  the  islands.141 

Merriman’s  record  stands  as  a  great  individual  accomplishment,  but  he  and  fellow 
commission  member  Thomas  Mendenhall  were  criticized  for  the  quality  of  their  assis¬ 
tance  to  the  U.S.  case  before  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration.  An  article  by  Henry  W.  Elliott  in 
The  Globe  is  a  lengthy  condemnation  of  the  U.S.  role  in  the 

failure  on  the  part  of  the  Bering  Sea  tribunal  of  arbitration  to  prescribe  adequate  rules 
and  regulations  for  the  protection  and  preservation  of  the  fur-seal  herd  of  Alaska  on  the 
islands  and  in  the  sea.142  [Merriam  and  Mendenhall  are]  two  utterly  inexperienced  men  as 
commissioners. . . .  These  commissioners  did  not  get  into  the  islands  until  one  week  after 
the  breeding  season  had  ended  (July  29,  1891);  they  remained  there  just  nine  days,  and  then 
returned  direct  to  Washington;  they  prepared  a  report,  which  erroneously  declared  that 
all  injury  to  the  life  of  the  fur-seal  herd  was  due  entirely  to  the  result  of  pelagic  sealing. . . . 

Then  as  scientists  they  stultified  themselves.  They  allowed  themselves  to  be  quoted  by  our 
[U.S.]  counsel ...  as  saying  in  the  name  of  science  that  the  fur  seal  was  not  a  wild  animal; 
that  it  comported  itself  in  the  Pribylov  Islands  precisely  as  cattle,  swine  or  sheep  do  on  our 
farms,  and  that  we  bear  the  same  relation  to  it  as  master  and  owner.143 

Although  fur-seal  expert  Victor  Scheffer  praised  Merriam’s  and  Mendenhall’s  ef¬ 
forts  many  years  later,144  their  inadequate  participation  and  that  of  the  U.S.  legal  team 
compelled  Treasury  Secretary  J.  W.  Foster  to  order  another,  more  intensive  investigation 
in  the  Territory  of  Alaska  in  1892.  Despite  the  Secretary’s  extra  effort,  the  Tribunal  of 
Arbitration  issued  an  award  lacking  both  adequate  protective  measures  and  enforcement 
authority,  a  decision  that  hastened  the  diminution  of  the  fur-seal  herd.  Whether  anyone 
in  1891  could  have  prevailed  despite  the  political  intrigues  of  the  period  is  a  question  yet 
to  be  explored  (see  Blaine  and  Elkins  biographies  for  additional  insights). 

Dr.  Merriam  returned  to  the  islands  July  9,  1899,  as  part  of  the  Edward  Henry 
Harriman  expedition  exploring  Alaskan  coastal  villages.145

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Biographical  Sketch 

From  John  Franklin  Miller’s  obituary  in  the  New  York  Times: 

General  Miller  was  in  his  fifty-fifth  year  and  a  native  of  Indiana,  his  parents  being 
Virginians  by  birth.  He  received  an  academic  education  at  South  Bend  and  began  the 
study  of  law  in  1849,  graduating  from  the  New  York  Law  School  three  years  later.  He  then 
returned  to  South  Bend  and  began  to  practice,  but  in  1863  he  left  Indiana  and  went  to 
California,  where  he  opened  a  law  office  in  Napa,  practicing  there  and  in  San  Francisco. 

He  remained  on  the  Pacific  slope  only  three  years  when  he  returned  to  his  native  State  and 
resumed  the  practice  of  his  profession.  He  was  a  member  of  the  Indiana  State  Senate  in 
1860,  but  resigned  his  seat  on  the  outbreak  of  the  war  to  take  a  position  on  Gov.  Morton’s 
staff,  with  the  rank  of  Colonel ...  he  was  brevetted  Major  General  [1865].  At  the  close  of 
the  war  he  was  offered  a  commission  in  the  regular  army,  but  declined  a  reappointment 
and  devoted  himself  to  building  up  a  commercial  business  [Alaska  Commercial  Company] 
in  which  he  made  a  large  fortune.  He  was  a  Republican  candidate  for  Presidential  Elector 
in  1872,  1878,  1880,  a  member  of  the  State  Constitutional  Convention  in  1879,  and  was 
elected  to  the  United  States  Senate  as  a  Republican  to  succeed  Newton  Booth,  taking  his 
seat  March  4,  1881. 147 


JOHN  F.  MILLER 

President  1870-1881 

General  in  United  States  Army,  serving  with 
Grant  during  the  Rebellion;  elected  U.  S.  Senator, 
and  died  in  office. 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

When  John  Franklin  Miller  agreed  to  the  presi¬ 
dency  of  the  newly  formed  Alaska  Commercial 
Company  in  1870,  he  was  already  a  successful 
lawyer  with  a  distinguished  military  record.  His 
legal  expertise  and  four  years  experience  as  a  cus¬ 
toms  collector  in  San  Francisco  equipped  him 
to  head  a  company  destined  to  become  one  of 
the  world’s  leading  suppliers  of  furs.  By  the  time 
he  left  the  ACC  for  the  U.S.  Senate  in  1881,  he 
and  those  invested  in  the  company  had  become 
wealthy  men. 

Miller  aggressively  pursued  control  of  the 
Pribilof  Islands  fur  industry.  As  a  result,  the  ACC 
wound  up  paying  twice  as  much  into  the  feder¬ 
al  treasury  coffers  as  expected  under  their  lease 
with  the  government.148  The  following  were  offi¬

Biographical  Sketch 

Norman  Miller  studied  science  as  a  young  man  and  became  a  druggist  in  Washington, 
D.C.,  in  1880.  At  that  time,  he  resided  in  Washington  with  his  wife,  Annie,  and  their  one- 
year-old  daughter,  Juliet.  He  later  made  his  home  in  Oakland,  California,  while  working 
with  the  U.S.  Fish  Commission.151  “Mr.  Miller  had  been  with  the  fish  commission  fifteen 
years,  and  joined  the  Albatross  when  she  was  first  commissioned  fourteen  years  ago.  He 
came  around  the  Horn  on  the  Albatross  and  was  a  zealous  worker  in  his  chosen  field, 
making  many  important  discoveries  in  marine  life  on  all  the  coasts  of  the  Pacific.”152 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Norman  Briscoe  Miller  is  best  known  for  his  photographs  of  the  Pribilof  Islands  —land¬ 
scapes,  seal  rookeries,  and  pelagic  sealers.  His  photographs  bearing  the  “NBM”  signa¬ 
ture  were  shot  during  the  1890s  while  he  was  working  as  laboratory  assistant  to  Charles 
Townsend  aboard  the  research  steamer  Albatross.

(1904-1989  and  1907-1989) 

Award-Winning  Cinematographers,  Disney  film  Seal  Island 
Genealogy 

Alfred  George  Milotte  was  born  November  24,  1904,  in  Appleton,  Wisconsin,  son  of 
Alphonse  E.  and  Ivy  P.  Milotte.  Alfred  Milotte  and  Elma  Moore  Jolly  were  married  on  June 
15,  1934,  in  Ketchikan,  Alaska.  Elma  was  born  in  Seattle  July  1,  1907,  daughter  of  Elmer 
and  Eva  Jolly  of  Puyallup,  Washington.153  Alfred  and  Elma  died  five  days  apart,  she  on 
April  19,  1989,  in  Puyallup,  Washington,  and  he  on  April  24  at  Gig  Harbor,  Washington.154 

Biographical  Sketch 

Alfred  Milotte  received  his  education  in  Seattle  and  attended  the  University  of  Washington 
and  Cornish  Art  School  (Cornish  College  of  Arts).  He  also  studied  at  the  Art  Institute  of 
Chicago  and  the  Chicago  Academy  of  Fine  Arts.  Elma  graduated  from  the  University  of 
Washington  in  1930  with  a  degree  in  education.  The  two  began  their  film  career  in  Alaska 
during  the  1930s,  working  out  of  their  photographic  studio  in  Ketchikan,  Alaska.  Alfred 
“worked  as  a  commercial  artist  and  lecturer  in  Alaska  and  produced  war  and  educational 
films  during  the  late  1930’s  and  early  1940’s.”155  The  couple  “lectured  and  showed  films  on 
Alaska  for  many  years  until  Walt  Disney  happened  to  see  some  of  their  work.  Without  any 
specific  projects  in  mind,  Disney  hired  them  to  film  the  Alaska  wilderness.”156  Alfred  and

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Elma  maintained  an  eleven-year  association  with  Disney,  shooting  wilderness  locations 
in  Alaska,  Florida,  Africa,  and  Australia.  Their  first  film,  Seal  Island,  won  an  Academy 
Award  in  1948  for  best  short  subject  documentary  (Film;  Winston  Hibler,  producer,  and 
James  Algar,  director;  Burbank,  CA:  Walt  Disney  Studios,  1948).  That  success,  along  with 
the  couple’s  subsequent  Academy  Award-winning  Alaskan  Eskimo,  led  Disney  to  send 
the  Milotte  film  team  to  Africa  and  Australia,  trips  that  resulted  in  “the  theatrical  motion 
pictures  The  African  Lion  and  Nature’s  Strangest  Creatures,  as  well  as  several  television 
productions.  Cameras  in  Africa  was  the  personal  story  of  the  Milottes  with  an  introduc¬ 
tion  by  Walt  Disney.”157  In  all,  the  Millotes  won  six  Academy  Awards  for  documentary 
and  short  subject  nature  films.  Alfred  Milotte  also  illustrated  a  number  of  Disney  nature 
books  and  wrote  several  children’s  books.158 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

In  August  of  1947,  “Alfred  and  Elma  shot  more  than  15,000  feet  of  16mm  Kodachrome, 
which  Walt  is  thinking  of  editing  into  a  two-reeler  now  tentatively  titled,  ‘Seal  Island’”159 
Seal  Island  was  filmed  on  location  in  the  Pribilofs  and  depicted  the  life  cycle  of  the  north¬ 
ern  fur  seal  in  its  natural  habitat,  along  with  the  islands’  abundant  bird  and  plant  life.  The 
two-reel,  twenty-seven-minute  documentary  was  produced  and  narrated  by  Winston 
Hibler  (1910-1976),  animated  by  James  N.  Algar  (1912-1998),  written  by  Jack  Jungmeyer 
(1883-1961),  and  edited  by  Anthony  Gerard  (1895-1987).  Seal  Island  was  Disney’s  first 
true-life  nature  film  and  the  first  in  his  television  series  “True  Life  Adventures,”  which  ran 
circa  1950- 1960.160  As  previously  noted,  Seal  Island  won  an  Oscar  in  1948.

Biographical  Sketch161 

John  Misikin  was  one  of  several  Aleut  leaders  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  from  the  1920s  until 
the  1950s  who  were  involved  in  the  effort  to  gain  the  Natives’  inherent  civil  rights  as  citi¬ 
zens  of  the  United  States.  Misikin  participated  in  surreptitious  meetings  during  the  late 
forties  to  plan  the  strategy  for  the  Pribilovians’  quest  for  freedom.  The  islanders  looked 
up  to  Misikin  and  other  leaders  for  their  knowledge,  intelligence,  and  leadership  abili¬ 
ties.  Misikin  is  one  of  five  men  portrayed  in  a  painting  now  hanging  in  the  St.  Paul  City 
Council  chambers.  The  portrait  was  commissioned  by  former  St.  Paul  City  Mayor  Larry 
Merculieff. 

John  Misikin  served  as  the  custodian  of  St.  Paul  Island  Orthodox  Church  for  decades 
and  was  the  cook  for  government  personnel  staying  at  the  Company  House,  as  it  was 
known  locally.  The  Company  House  became  the  King  Eider  Hotel  after  the  government 
withdrew  from  administration  of  the  islands  in  1983. 162 

John  Misikin’s  son,  Victor,  became  the  local  government  foreman  and  was  notorious 
among  many  of  the  local  people  for  being  a  hard  driver.  163

Genealogy 

Norman  D.  Morgan  was  born  in  San  Francisco 
on  December  9,  1885,  the  son  of  Daniel  Morgan, 
a  native  of  Guysborough  County,  Nova  Scotia, 
Canada,  who  had  immigrated  to  San  Francisco 
in  1870.  However,  Norman  was  raised  by  William

Experience 

Norman  Morgan  attended  San  Francisco’s  public 
schools.  In  1910,  he  received  the  degree  of  doctor 
of  medicine  from  Cooper  Medical  College,  now 
part  of  Stanford  University. 

Dr.  Morgan  entered  the  United  States  Army  as  a  contract  surgeon,  in  which  capacity  he 
served  for  one  year.  This  led  to  an  advancement  to  the  position  of  surgeon  in  the  army, 
with  an  assignment  to  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  the  Bering  Sea  off  Alaska,  where  he  remained 
during  the  year  1912  [sic;  1910-191 1],  He  then  returned  to  San  Francisco,  having  been 
honorably  discharged  from  the  military  service,  and  here  took  up  his  private  practice, 
specializing  in  surgical  work. . . .  During  the  period  when  the  United  States  was  engaged 
in  the  World  war  [World  War  I],  Dr.  Morgan  was  overseas  for  eighteen  months  in  the 
French  war  zone,  and  at  the  time  of  his  honorable  discharge  he  held  the  rank  of  major 
in  the  medical  corps.  After  the  close  of  the  war,  he  received  a  special  degree  from  the 
London  Hospital  in  recognition  of  his  valuable  services  in  surgery.  He  is  also  a  Fellow  of

I  am  44  years  of  age  and  reside  in  the  town  of  Groton,  Conn.  In  1886, 1  shipped  as  second 
mate  of  the  bark  Peru,  owned  by  the  firm  of  William  [s]  &  Haven,  of  the  city  of  New 
London,  Conn.,  which  vessel  was  commanded  by  my  father,  Capt.  Ebenezer  Morgan,  and 
sailed  on  that  bark  from  Honolulu  about  the  27th  day  of  February,  1868,  for  the  purpose 
of  catching  seals  on  the  islands  in  Bering  Sea,  Williams  &  Haven  having  for  many  years 
been  engaged  in  seal  fisheries,  and  being,  so  far  as  I  know,  the  largest  firm  in  the  United 
States  engaged  in  that  business.  We  sailed  to  the  port  of  Sitka  and  there  supplied  to  the 
commander,  Gen.  Jefferson  C.  Davis,  for  permission  to  land  the  cargo  of  the  bark  on  the 
Pribilof  Islands  and  take  seals  on  those  islands.  At  the  end  of  the  season  I  remained  on  the 
island  of  St.  Paul,  one  of  the  said  Pribilof  Islands,  until  August,  1869,  as  a  representative  of 
Williams  &  Haven’s  interest  in  and  about  said  island.  In  the  last  mentioned  year  I  returned 
to  this  country,  and,  at  the  request  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  of  which  Williams 
&  Haven  were  stockholders,  I  was  employed  in  the  year  1874  to  return  to  the  Pribilof 
Islands  as  a  representative  of  said  Alaska  Commercial  Company. 

In  pursuance  of  such  request  I  returned  to  the  island  as  agent  of  said  last-mentioned 
company  in  charge  of  the  island  of  St.  George,  which  with  the  islands  of  St.  Paul,  Otter, 
and  Walrus,  constitute  the  group  known  as  the  Pribilof  Islands.  I  arrived  at  said  island 
some  time  in  May,  1874;  took  up  my  residence  there,  and  remained  in  my  capacity  of 
agent  in  and  about  that  island  during  each  sealing  season  thereafter  until  the  year  1887. 

At  the  expiration  of  the  sealing  season  of  1887, 1  returned  to  the  United  States,  and  in 
1891,  was  engaged  by  the  Russian  Sealskin  Company,  of  St.  Petersburg,  as  chief  agent  of 
that  company,  to  proceed  to  the  islands  of  Komandorski,  consisting  of  Copper  and  Bering 
Islands,  commonly  called  the  Commander  Islands. . . . 

On  my  first  arrival  in  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  1868,  several  other  vessels,  representatives 
of  different  interests,  were  there  for  the  purpose  of  killing  seals;  and  the  natives  of  these 
islands,  called  Aleuts,  were  nearly  all  employed  by  one  or  other  of  the  vessels  in  the 
business  of  killing  seals.  I  noticed  that  the  natives  always  remonstrated  whenever  any 
female  was  killed  and  stated  that  that  was  forbidden,  and  I  am  informed  that  it  always  had 
been  forbidden  by  the  Russian  Government. . . .  My  knowledge  of  the  catch  of  1868  enables 
me  to  state  that  the  destruction  of  seals  from  all  sources  in  that  year  was  about  240,000. 166

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

John  Morton  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  May  11,  1892,  before  Notary 
Public  Clement  Bennett  at  San  Francisco,  California.  The  following  is  from  his  deposi¬ 
tion. 


I  am  United  States  shipping  commissioner  at  San  Francisco.  The  Alaska  Commercial 
Company  obtained  the  lease  of  the  seal  islands  in  1869  [1870].  In  the  fall  of  that  year  I  went 
to  Alaska  on  the  steamer  Constantine  as  an  agent  of  said  company,  arriving  at  St.  Paul 
Island  in  October,  where  I  remained  until  the  close  of  the  sealing  season  in  the  following 
year.  During  the  summer  of  1872, 1  visited  all  of  the  trading  posts  of  the  company,  both  on 
the  mainland  of  Alaska  and  the  various  islands,  thus  spending  the  entire  summer  in  Bering 
Sea.  This  trip  was  extended  to  Copper  and  Bering  islands,  belonging  to  the  Russians,  and 
of  which  members  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  had  control  at  that  time,  and  to 
Petropaulovski  in  Kamchatka.  In  the  course  of  our  voyage  in  1872,  we  touched  twice  at  the 
seal  islands  of  Alaska,  spending  there  altogether,  perhaps,  a  week  or  ten  days.  During  our 
stay  at  St.  Paul  this  year,  I  visited  (in  July)  most  of  the  rookeries  and  hauling  grounds  of  the 
fur-seals. 

The  summer  of  1873  I  spent  on  St.  George,  and  while  there  my  business  called  me 
frequently  to  the  various  portions  of  the  island  where  the  seals  were  accustomed  to 
congregate. ...  In  1875  and  again  in  1876  I  went  north,  spending  both  seasons  on  St.  Paul 
Island.  I  resigned  my  position  with  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  in  the  fall  of  1876,  but 
in  the  spring  of  1877  I  was  appointed  to  the  position  of  Treasury  agent  at  the  seal  islands 
(in  charge),  and  entered  upon  the  discharge  of  my  official  duties  in  May  of  that  year.  169

islands  in  the  fall  of  1884. 1  spent  four  summers  on  St.  George  Island,  and  one  winter,  from 
1877  to  1881,  and  four  summers  and  four  winters  on  St.  Paul  Island,  from  1881  to  1884.170

Biographical  Sketch 

[In  1849,  the  Muir  family]  immigrated  to  the  United  States  and  settled  near  the  Fox 
River  in  Wisconsin.  John  helped  to  clear  the  land,  worked  on  the  farm  and  attended  the 
University  of  Wisconsin,  1860-1864,  paying  his  tuition  with  money  earned  by  farming 
and  school  teaching.  He  made  extended  botanical  and  geological  excursions  in  Wisconsin, 

Indiana,  Michigan  and  Canada  and  in  the  southern  states  ...  in  1868  visited  the  Yosemite 
Valley,  California,  exploring  and  examining  its  flora  and  fauna.  He  lived  an  isolated  life  in 
the  Sierra  Nevada  mountains  for  ten  years,  exploring  the  glacial  formations;  was  a  member 
of  an  exploring  expedition  connected  with  the  geodetic  survey  in  the  Great  Basin,  1876-79; 
made  several  trips  to  the  northwest  region,  and  while  in  Alaska  discovered  the  Glacier  bay 
and  the  great  Glacier  which  bears  his  name.  He  also  made  a  trip  to  the  headwaters  of  the 
Yukon  and  McKenzie  rivers,  and  in  1881  was  connected  with  one  of  the  expeditions  to 
search  for  the  lost  Jeannette  expedition.  The  honorary  degree  of  A.M.  was  conferred  on 
him  by  Harvard  in  1896  and  that  of  LL.D.  by  the  Wisconsin  State  University  in  1897.  He

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

United  States  Treasury  Agent  Harrison  Gray  Otis  wrote  about  the  arrival  of  the  Revenue 
Cutter  Corwin,  which  carried  some  esteemed  guests  to  St.  Paul  Island  on  May  23,  1881. 

About  1  p.m.  the  U.S.  Revenue  Cutter  “Thomas  Corwin,”  from  San  Francisco  May  4,  and 
Ounalaska  May  22,  arrived,  anchored  on  the  west  side,  and  was  boarded  by  the  agents. 

Capt.  Hooper,  commanding,  came  ashore  with  several  of  his  officers  bringing  newspaper 
files  for  April.  After  procuring  from  the  A.C.  Co.  some  330  pup-seal  skins  (in  blankets)  for 
use  in  his  expected  Arctic  expedition,  he  set  sail  from  the  East  side  about  7:30  p.m.  and 
bore  away  to  the  northward.173 

Among  the  members  of  the  Corwin  expedition  was  naturalist  John  Muir,  who  gave 
his  impressions  of  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  his  book  Cruise  of  the  Corwin: 

St.  Paul,  Alaska,  May  23,  1881 

About  four  o’clock  yesterday  morning  the  Corwin  left  Unalaska,  and  arrived  at  St.  Paul 
shortly  after  noon  to-day,  the  distance  being  about  one  hundred  and  ninety  miles.  This 
is  the  metropolis  of  the  Fur  Seal  Islands,  situated  on  the  island  of  St.  Paul — a  handsome 
village  of  sixty-four  neat  frame  cottages,  with  a  large  church,  schoolhouse,  and  priest’s 
residence,  and  a  population  of  nearly  three  hundred  Aleuts,  and  from  twelve  to  twenty 
whites. 

It  is  interesting  to  find  here  an  isolated  group  of  Alaskan  natives  wholly  under  white 
influence  and  control,  and  who  have  a  great  part  abandoned  their  own  pursuits,  clothing, 
and  mode  of  life  in  general,  and  adopted  that  of  the  whites.  They  are  all  employed  by  the 
Alaska  Commercial  Company  as  butchers,  to  kill  and  flay  the  hundred  thousand  seals  that 
they  take  annually  here  and  at  the  neighboring  island  of  St.  George.  Their  bloody  work  lasts 
about  two  months,  and  they  earn  in  this  time  from  three  hundred  to  six  hundred  dollars 
apiece,  being  paid  forty  cents  per  skin. 

The  Company  supplies  them  with  a  school,  medical  attendance,  and  comfortable  dwellings, 
and  looks  after  their  welfare  in  general,  its  own  interest  being  involved.  They  even  have  a 


473 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


bank,  and  are  encouraged  to  save  their  money,  which  many  of  them  do,  having  accounts 
of  from  two  hundred  to  three  thousand  dollars.  Fortunately,  the  Aleuts  of  St.  Paul  and 
St.  George  are  pretty  effectively  guarded  against  whiskey  and  to  some  extent  against 
kvass  also.  Only  limited  quantities  of  sugar  and  other  kvass  material  are  sold  to  them. 
Nevertheless  one  of  their  number  told  one  of  our  officers  to-day  that  he  had  a  bank  account 
of  eight  hundred  dollars  and  would  give  it  all  for  five  bottles  of  whiskey;  and  an  agent  of  the 
Company  gave  it  as  his  opinion  that  there  were  not  six  perfectly  sober  Aleuts  on  the  whole 
island  to-day. 

The  number  of  fur  seals  that  resort  to  these  two  islands,  St.  Paul  and  St.  George,  during  the 
breeding  season,  is  estimated  at  from  three  to  four  million,  and  there  seems  to  be  no  falling 
off  in  numbers  since  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  began  operations  here.  Only  young 
males  are  killed  by  the  Company,  but  many  of  both  sexes  are  taken  far  from  here  among 
the  Aleutian  Islands  and  around  the  shores  of  Vancouver  Island  and  the  outermost  of  the 
Alexander  Archipelago. 

No  one  knows  certainly  whence  they  come  or  whither  they  go.  But  inasmuch  as  they  make 
their  appearance  every  year  about  the  shores  of  the  Aleutian  Islands  shortly  after  their 
disappearance  from  St.  Paul  and  St.  George,  and  then  later  to  the  southward,  toward  the 
coast  to  British  Columbia,  it  is  supposed  that  they  are  the  same  animals,  and  that  they  thus 
make  journeys  every  year  of  a  thousand  miles  or  more,  and  return  to  their  birthplaces  like 
shoals  of  salmon.  They  begin  to  appear  on  the  breeding-grounds  about  the  first  of  June. 
These  are  old  males,  who  at  once  take  up  their  stations  on  high  ground  a  short  distance 
from  the  shore,  and  keep  possession  of  their  places  while  they  await  the  coming  of  the 
pregnant  females  who  arrive  about  a  month  later,  accompanied  by  the  younger  members 
of  the  community.  At  the  height  of  the  season  the  ground  is  closely  covered  with  them,  and 
they  seldom  go  back  into  the  water  or  take  any  food  until  the  young  are  well  grown  and  all 
are  ready  to  leave  the  islands  in  the  fall. 

In  addition  to  the  one  hundred  thousand  taken  here,  the  Company  obtains  about  forty 
thousand  by  purchase  from  the  Russians  at  Bering  and  Copper  Islands,  and  from  Indians 
and  traders  at  different  points  south  as  far  as  Oregon.  These  skins  are  said  to  be  worth 
fifteen  dollars  apiece  in  the  London  market,  to  which  they  are  all  sent.  The  government 
revenue  derived  from  the  one  hundred  thousand  killed  each  year  is  $317,000. 

Next  in  importance  among  the  fur  animals  of  Alaska,  is  the  sea-otter,  of  which  about  six 
thousand  a  year  are  taken,  worth  from  eighty  dollars  to  one  hundred  dollars  apiece. 

The  Aleuts  obtain  from  thirty  to  fifty  dollars  in  goods  or  money,  an  alternative  not  due  to 
the  fact  that  the  goods  are  sold  for  their  money  value,  but  to  the  fact  that  the  traders  sooner 
or  later  receive  back  whatever  money  they  pay  out  instead  of  goods.  Unlimited  competition 
would,  of  course,  run  the  price  much  higher,  as,  for  example,  it  has  done  in  south-eastern 
Alaska.  Here  the  only  competition  lies  between  the  Western  Fur  and  Trading  Company 
and  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company.  The  latter  gets  most  of  them.  Each  company  seeks 
the  good-will  of  the  best  hunters  by  every  means  in  its  power,  by  taking  them  to  and 
from  the  hunting  grounds  in  schooners,  by  advancing  provisions  and  all  sorts  of  supplies, 
by  building  cottages  for  them,  and  supplying  them  with  the  services  of  a  physician  and 
medicine  free.  Only  Indians  are  allowed  by  law  to  take  furs,  and  whites  married  to  Indian 
women.  This  law  had  induced  some  fifteen  white  men  to  marry  Indians  for  the  privilege  of 
taking  sea-otter.  They  have  settled  at  Unga  Island,  one  of  the  Shumagin  group,  where  there 
is  a  village  of  some  hundred  and  eighty-five  Indians. 

Seen  from  the  sea,  all  the  Pribilof  Islands— St.  Paul,  St.  George,  and  Otter  Island— appear 
as  mere  rocks,  naked  and  desolate  fragments  of  lava,  wasted  into  bluffs  where  they  touch 
the  sea,  and  shorn  off  on  top  by  the  ice-sheet.  The  gray  surfaces  are  roughened  here  and 
there  by  what,  at  a  distance,  seem  to  be  degraded  volcanic  cones.  Nevertheless,  they  are 
exceedingly  interesting,  not  only  because  of  the  marvelous  abundance  of  life  about  them— 
seals,  water  birds,  and  fishes — but  because  they  tell  so  grand  a  story  concerning  the  ice- 
sheet  that  swept  over  them  all  from  the  north.174

John  Muir  wrote  eloquently,  but  at  least  two  of  his  statements  were  not  factual.  It  is 
now  known  that  glaciers  never  covered  St.  Paul  Island;  and  the  fur  seals  at  the  time  of  his 
visit  very  likely  numbered  fewer  than  two  million,  if  not  far  fewer  than  two  million,  rather 
than  “three  to  four  million.”

October  4,  1898,  shortly  after  arriving  home  from 
St.  Paul  Island.  Anna  Balakshin,  an  Aleut  girl, 
had  left  St.  Paul  with  him  on  August  23,  1898, 
to  attend  school  in  Fort  Collins,  Colorado,  with 
his  children.  Anna  returned  to  St.  Paul  Island  on 
June  10,  1899,  after  spending  the  winter  with  the 
Murray  family.176

[Joseph  Murray]  . . .  came  from  a  humble  yet  Library,  Thomas  L.  Moore  Coll.) 

honest  parentage  and  early  developed  those  traits 

of  character  that  made  him  a  marked  man  throughout  his  eventful  career.  His  leading 
characteristics  were  liveliness  of  temperament,  enthusiasm,  ready  sympathy  with  the  weak 
or  suffering,  and  untiring  energy.  He  was  educated  in  the  national  schools  of  Ireland  and 
at  Salford  College  in  England,  but  did  not  remain  long  enough  at  school  to  thoroughly 
perfect  his  education,  but  inspired  by  a  love  of  adventure  he  enlisted  at  the  age  of  sixteen 
years  in  the  Foreign  legion  of  the  army  of  France  and  fought  under  Marshal  McMahon  in 
the  campaign  of  1859  against  Austrians. ...  At  the  conclusion  of  hostilities,  Murray  then 
but  about  18  years  old,  came  to  America  in  company  with  several  other  young  compatriots 
with  the  express  purpose  of  enlisting  in  the  Union  army.  He  landed  in  New  York  and  joined 
the  famous  69th  New  York  Volunteers,  which  was  attached  to  General  Francis  Meagher’s 
Irish  Brigade  in  consequence  of  his  previous  military  experience.  Murray  was  appointed 
drill  master  of  the  regiment.  Entering  the  service  in  1861.  He  attained  the  rank  of  second 
lieutenant  before  being  mustered  out. 


After  the  war  Mr.  Murray  went  to  New  York  City  where  he  acted  for  a  time  as  bookkeeper 
in  a  wholesale  house.  He  then  went  to  Paterson,  N.J.  and  was  employed  as  foreman  in

a  factory  there. ...  In  1870,  being  attracted  by  the  novel  and  adventurous  spirit  of  the 
Greeley  colony  then  being  organized  in  New  York  by  the  late  N.C.  Meeker,  he  joined  that 
enterprise  and  came  to  Colorado  and  assisted  materially  in  the  establishment  of  the  colony 
and  the  organization  of  the  town  of  Greeley.  For  three  years  he  followed  the  destinies  of  the 
newly  organized  colony,  when  he  removed  to  Larimer  County  and  taking  up  a  ranch  under 
the  homestead  laws  near  Fossil  Creek,  five  miles  south  of  this  city,  went  into  farming.  1 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Joseph  Murray  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  March  19, 1892,  before  Notary 
Public  Charles  L.  Hughes  at  Washington,  D.C.: 

I  reside  at  Fort  Collins,  Colo.;  I  am  49  years  of  age,  and  I  am  the  first  assistant  special  agent 
at  the  seal  islands  in  Bering  Sea.  That  in  pursuance  of  Department  instructions  to  me, 
dated  April  20,  1889, 1  proceeded  to  the  seal  islands  and  landed  on  St.  George  Island  May 
31,  1889.  That  I  had  charge  of  that  island  until  July  1,  1890,  and  I  was  present  during  the 
whole  of  two  sealing  seasons  on  the  island  of  St.  George. ...  In  pursuance  of  instructions 
from  Agent  Goff,  I  left  St.  George  Island  on  the  19th  of  July,  1890,  and  landed  on  St.  Paul 
Island  on  the  20th  of  the  same  month,  and  remained  there  until  August,  1891. 178 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

The  circumstances  that  brought  Joseph  Murray  to  the  Pribilof  Islands  began  during 
President  Benjamin  Harrison’s  campaign  in  1889: 

Bankrupt  and  harassed  by  a  thousand  perplexities  he  did  not  know  which  way  to  turn 
when  the  Harrison  campaign  opened  with  its  high  tariff  issues.  Mr.  Murray  was  always  a 
high  tariff  man  and  offered  his  services  to  the  republican  managers  as  a  stump  speaker. 

He  was  readily  accepted,  as  his  fame  as  a  forcible  and  witty  public  speaker  was  known  far 
and  wide.  He  was  sent  down  into  Indiana  to  deliver  tariff  speeches  before  the  laboring 
classes  and  spoke  night  and  day  to  immense  crowds.  The  state  was  carried  for  Harrison 
and  in  recognition  of  services  rendered,  Mr.  Murray  was  appointed  special  agent  of  the 
treasury  department  to  take  charge  of  the  Alaskan  seal  fisheries  which  were  being  rapidly 
depleted  by  the  incursions  of  the  pelagic  sealers.  Here  was  a  field  that  just  suited  his 
restless,  energetic  nature  and  he  plunged  into  the  discharge  of  his  new  duties  with  all  his 
accustomed  vim  and  it  is  stated  that  he  said  shortly  before  his  death,  that  he  never  worked 
so  hard  as  he  had  done  in  the  ten  years  that  he  had  been  in  charge  of  the  seal  fisheries, 
which  was  no  doubt  true  to  the  letter  and  a  fact  to  which  his  untimely  death  may  be 
attributed.  In  the  care  of  the  seal  rookeries  and  the  supervision  of  the  fish  canneries  he  had 
an  enormous  territory  to  cover.  From  Sitka,  the  capital  of  the  territory,  to  the  western  most 
island  owned  by  the  United  States  is  nearly  5,000  miles. 

Then,  during  all  of  his  administration,  the  country  has  been  engaged  with  Great  Britain  in 
the  seal  embargo  which  added  much  to  the  labor  and  perplexities  of  his  position.  He  was 
appointed  assistant  commissioner  to  investigate  the  seal  rookeries  of  Russia  and  Japan  and 
sailed  thousands  of  miles  through  arctic  seas  making  these  investigations.  He  inaugurated 
many  new  methods  in  caring  for  the  seals  and  protecting  them  from  the  terrible  inroads 
being  made  by  the  pelagic  sealers.  Among  these  were  the  branding  of  the  female  seals  in 
order  to  destroy  the  commercial  value  of  their  skin  and  the  protection  from  the  rapacious 
marauders  of  open  sea  sealing,  and  the  herding  of  male  seals  on  the  seal  islands  [sic]  during 
the  open  season. 

It  was  upon  his  recommendation  that  the  joint  high  commission,  composed  of 
representatives  of  the  governments  of  the  United  States,  Great  Britain,  Russia  and  Japan, 
was  appointed  to  investigate  the  seal  rookeries  and  report  some  more  feasible  code 
of  regulations  for  their  care  and  protection  than  have  hitherto  been  in  vogue,  and  it  is 
expected  that  the  commission  will  make  their  final  report  during  the  coming  winter  and

that  their  recommendations  will  result  in  the  settlement  of  the  vexed  seal  question  between 
the  United  States  and  Great  Britain  for  many  years  to  come.179 

Government  agents  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  lived  with  the  constant  threat  of  clashes 
with  pelagic  sealers,  many  of  whom  possessed  such  bravado  that  they  would  invade  the 
islands  to  kill  seals  or  would  ram  the  agents’  small  boats  when  in  chase.  Agents  Joseph 
Crowley  and  Joseph  Murray  wrote  in  a  joint  letter  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  J.  G. 
Carlisle: 

On  this  all-important  subject  much  has  been  said  by  the  respective  agents  in  charge  of 
the  Seal  Islands,  from  the  time  that  marauding  schooners  first  appeared  in  the  Bering  Sea, 
and  their  reports  were  noticed  by  the  British  Sea  commissioners  when  summing  up  their 
charges  against  our  Government  for  dereliction  of  duty  during  the  pendency  of  the  Bering 
Sea  arbitration  matter.  On  page  32  of  their  report  we  find  the  following  language: 

“Some  further  evidences  have  been  obtained  in  respect  to  the  frequency  of  the  raid 
upon  the  islands,  and  the  facility  with  which  in  consequence  of  the  wholly  inadequate 
protection  afforded  by  the  U.S.  Government,  such  illegal  and  highly  injurious  onslaughts 
on  the  seal  life  of  the  islands  have  been  made.  When  it  is  shown  on  the  sworn  evidence  of 
men  who  were  concerned  or  took  part  in  such  raids  that  two  schooners  anchored  to  the 
northward  off  St.  Paul  for  nearly  the  whole  of  the  summer  of  1881 -‘82,  raiding  the  islands 
whenever  the  weather  permitted  a  landing  to  be  made,  it  can  no  longer  be  maintained 
by  any  impartial  person  that  the  protection  of  the  breeding  islands  has  been  in  any  sense 
satisfactory.”180 

Since  the  British  commissioners  were  on  the  seal  islands  an  improved  method  of  protection 
has  been  adopted  by  the  Department,  part  of  which  is  to  send  revenue  cutters  to  patrol  the 
sea  around  the  island  until  late  in  the  fall,  all  of  which  we  heartily  approve. 

In  addition  to  this,  however,  and  in  order  to  give  absolute  protection  to  the  rookeries,  we 
ask  for  the  erection  of  a  system  of  telephonic  communication  between  the  Government 
house  and  the  watchhouses  [sic]  on  the  rookeries. 

By  this  means  constant  communication  can  be  had  between  the  agent  in  charge  and  the 
native  guard  on  the  islands.  The  natives  are  able  and  willing  to  perform  the  duty  of  guards, 
but  heretofore  their  facilities  to  perform  such  duty  have  been  very  limited  and  of  the  most 
primitive  type.181 

Mr.  Macoun  had  alleged  in  the  counter  case  by  Great  Britain  during  the  Fur-Seal 
Arbitration  that  “there  is  only  one  telephone  line  on  the  islands  and  that  during  a  greater 
portion  of  the  season  this  line  is  not  in  working  condition.”182 

Agents  Murray  and  Crowley  continued  on  in  their  letter  to  Secretary  of  the  Treasury 
Carlisle: 

[Macoun’s]  statement  cannot  be  successfully  denied,  and,  in  fact,  the  only  telephone  line 
upon  either  of  the  islands  is  the  one  from  the  North  American  Commercial  Company’s 
house  to  the  northeast  point  rookery  (a  distance  of  12  miles)  on  St.  Paul  Island,  and  this 
line  is  owned  by  and  kept  under  the  exclusive  management  of  the  company. 

With  the  present  system  of  patrolling  Bering  Sea  by  armed  vessels,  and  with  telephonic 
communication  on  the  islands  as  indicated  by  us,  so  that  the  agent  in  charge  may  be  in 
constant  touch  with  the  guards  on  each  rookery,  we  have  no  hesitation  in  saying  that 
absolute  protection  can  be  given  to  the  islands  as  against  any  future  attempt  of  seal 
poachers.  To  accomplish  this  it  will  require  40  miles  of  wire  and  9  telephones,  at  an 
expense,  approximated  at  $2,000.

Alaska  and  Polar  Regions  Coll.,  Rasmuson  Library,  University  of  Alaska  Fairbanks.) 


A  supply  of  50  Winchester  repeating  rifles  and  sufficient  ammunition  for  guarding 
purposes  will  cost  $1,000. 

In  this  respect  we  find  copied  in  the  Counter-case  of  Great  Britain  Fur  Seal  Arbitration 
Case,  p.  292,  from  the  report  of  Agent  A.  W.  Lavender,  in  1890,  as  follows: 

"I  have  again  to  request  you  to  do  your  best  to  obtain  arms  and  ammunition  for  these 
islands,  and  hope  you  will  be  able  to  secure  them,  for  without  them  the  rookeries  can 
not  be  protected  in  a  proper  manner.  The  only  rifles  that  answer  for  the  protection  of  the 
rookeries  belong  to  the  natives  and  are  of  but  little  use. 

“In  addition  to  the  few  rifles  owned  by  the  natives  the  company  has  found  four  small  Colt’s 
rifles  and  one  Sharp’s,  with  very  little  ammunition  for  any  of  them.” 

Following  which  quotation  we  find  the  following  allegation  by  the  British  commissioners. 

“It  will  thus  be  seen  that  raiding  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  has  been  carried  on  persistently,  at 
least  since  1868,  and  that  from  that  date  the  authorities  have  known  of  the  raids,  and  from 
the  earliest  time  urgently  demanded  precautions  in  prevention.  In  short,  under  present 
regulations  and  arrangements  there  is  no  difficulty  or  danger  whatever  to  vessels  raiding 
along  shore  in  the  night  or  in  any  of  the  frequent  fogs  at  several  of  the  best  rookeries, 
except  when  a  revenue  cutter  chances  to  be  close  by,  an  occasional  occurrence  well  known 
to  every  marauding  schooner.”183 

In  1892,  the  Native  work  crew  constructed  two  new  watch  houses  at  Halfway  Point 
(Polovina)  and  Zapadni  to  attempt  to  spot  and  ward  off  these  pirates.  On  September 
13,  1892,  as  Assistant  Agent  Murray  readied  to  depart  St.  Paul  Island,  the  steamer  Rush 
landed  500  cartridges  on  St.  Paul  Island  for  government  use,  presumably  in  defense 
against  marauders,  along  with  six  Springfield  rifles,  bringing  the  total  on  the  island  to

twelve  Springfield  rifles  and  540  rounds.184  When  Murray  returned  in  1893,  he  spoke 
bluntly: 

Put  a  Winchester  rifle  into  the  hands  of  every  adult  male  on  the  island  (they  prefer  45-70 
[caliber])  and  then  put  agents  in  charge  who  are  physically  able  to  walk  over  the  rough 
ground  when  it  becomes  necessary  to  do  so,  and  it  will  be  found  that  no  outsiders  are 
needed  there  to  do  guard  duty. 

I  most  earnestly  call  the  attention  of  the  Department  to  the  fact  that  the  fewer  strangers, 
whether  guards,  visitors,  or  others,  allowed  to  land  or  dwell  upon  the  seal  islands,  the 
better  it  is  for  the  native  people,  who  are  rarely  benefited  by  contact  with  white  men. 

To  send  white  men,  as  a  reserve  guard,  to  remain  in  the  villages  while  the  natives  go  out 
from  6  to  12  miles  to  guard  the  seals,  is  to  insult  and  injure  every  native  man  on  the  island, 
and,  if  persisted  in,  will  eventually  end  in  blood.  For  the  sake  of  peace— for  the  good  of 
the  native  people — I  suggest  that  no  more  white  men,  soldiers  or  sailors,  be  landed  on  the 
islands  to  do  guard  duty.185 

On  June  12,  1894,  Joseph  Murray  was  appointed  Special  Treasury  Agent  and  Alaska 
Salmon  Commissioner,  after  being  an  assistant  agent  on  St.  Paul  Island  in  1891  and  1893. 
He  was  instructed  by  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  John  G.  Carlisle  to  make  a  complete  in¬ 
vestigation  of  the  Alaska  fisheries  and  the  fur-seal  industry.  The  following  excerpts  from 
the  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s  Log  kept  by  Assistant  Agent  James  Judge  mention  Salmon 
Commissioner  Murray’s  presence  on  the  island  in  the  company  of  Assistant  Secretary  of 
the  Treasury  C.  S.  Hamlin:

August  3,  1894 

Revenue  cutter  Rush  came  to  anchor  at  East  Landing,  having  on  board  Mr.  C.  S.  Hamlin 
Assistant  Secretary  of  Treasury,  Mr.  McGrath  his  private  secretary  and  Col.  Joseph  Murray 
Salmon  Commissioner. 


August  4,  1894 

Made  a  seal  drive  from  the  Reef,  Sec.  Hamlin  attending  both  the  drive  and  killing  and 
afterwards  visiting  the  Reef  and  intervening  breeding  grounds. ...  In  the  evening  a  dance 
was  given  which  was  attended  by  every  man  woman  and  child  in  the  village  in  honor  of  the 
Hon.  Secretary. 


August  5,  1894 

The  Hon.  Secty.  of  the  U.S.  Treasury  Mr.  Hamlin  visited  Katvie  &  Lukannon  Rookeries 
and  in  the  afternoon  he  visited  Tolstoi,  Middlehill  [Polovina]  and  Zapadnie  rookeries.  At  5 
o’clock  in  the  evening  Father  Reseff  [Rysev]  held  special  services  in  the  church  in  honor  of 
the  Secretary. 

August  6,  1894 

Hon.  C.S.  Hamlin  came  ashore  from  the  Rush  at  9:30.  In  accordance  with  the  Russian 
custom  of  expressing  allegiance  and  loyalty  to  the  government  under  which  they  live;  a 
committee  of  the  natives  headed  by  their  chief,  Nicoli  Krukoff,  waited  upon  Hon.  C.S. 
Hamlin  and  presented  him  with  a  loaf  of  bread  in  which  a  crevice  had  been  cut  and  the 
hole  filled  with  salt.  The  distinguished  gentleman  accepted  the  token  of  esteem  with 
becoming  dignity  and  expressed  his  appreciation  both  of  the  present  and  the  people  on  the 
Island. 


August  7,  1894 

At  9am  Sec.  Hamlin  accompanied  by  Salmon  Commissioner  Murray  went  to  N.E.  Point 
in  a  buckboard,  returning  in  the  evening  reporting  that  the  weather  was  all  that  could  be 
desired  and  that  they  had  a  splendid  view  of  the  point. 

To  Col.  Murray  belongs  the  credit  of  having  originated  the  agitation  which  resulted  in  the 
procuring  of  an  annual  appropriations  for  the  sustenance  of  the  people  and  for  the  bringing 
of  fuel  in  plenty  to  the  Islands.  Nor  did  he  stop  here,  for  on  his  departure  last  August  he

James  Macoun  was  on  the  island  in  1913  but  should  have  said  1914.  Hanna  identified  Dr.  Hunter 
as  the  doctor  attending  to  Macoun,  but  Dr.  Hunter  was  not  on  St.  Paul  Island  until  1915.  Hanna 
also  said  he  took  a  photograph  of  Macoun  with  Henry  W.  Elliott  and  Agent  Walter  Lembkey;  the 
latter  two  were  present  in  1913  but  not  in  1914,  when  Macoun  was  there.  Victor  B.  Scheffer,  Clifford

Nikolai  and  Bishop  Paul  Popov  during  the  Russian-American  transition  provides  some  interest¬ 
ing  perspective.  “During  the  Holy  Week  of  1868,  an  Orthodox  Priest  was  sent  to  the  City  [San 
Francisco]  from  Alaska  to  conduct  the  paschal  services  here.  That  priest,  Father  Nicholas  Kovrigin,

became  the  first  permanent  Orthodox  minister  in  San  Francisco  (until  his  return  to  Russia  in  1879).”

Bishop  Paul  (Popov)  of  Novoarkhangelsk  (New  Archangel)  had  assigned  Fr.  Nikolai  to  San  Francisco 
in  1868.  "Bishop  [Bp.]  Paul  arrived  in  Alaska  as  it  was  being  sold  to  the  United  States,  and  he  was 
confronted  with  the  transition  from  Russian  to  American  rule.  The  incoming  American  sectarians 
were  accompanied  by  the  military,  and  life,  particularly  in  New  Archangel,  became  perilous.  Sitka, 
as  the  New  Archangel  became  known,  was  reduced  to  a  population  of  only  twenty  families  by  1877. 

With  the  multitude  of  changes  that  this  transition  caused,  his  rule  was  marked  by  great  difficulties.  It 
was  also  during  this  period  that  Bp.  Paul  initiated  a  move  that  heralded  the  coming  transfer  of  the  see 
to  San  Francisco.  For  a  period  of  time  Bp.  Paul  had  assigned  Priest  Nikolai  Kovrigin  to  San  Francisco 
to  serve  the  spiritual  needs  of  the  Slavic  population  in  the  San  Francisco  area.  Fr.  Nikolai  arrived  in 
late  March  of  1868.  He  served  his  first  Divine  Liturgy  on  Pascha  in  a  residence  on  Mission  Street. 

Fr.  Nikolai  also  noted  in  his  report  to  Bp.  Paul  that  the  Gospel  was  read  in  four  languages;  Greek, 

Slavonic,  English,  and  Russian.”  Fr.  Nikolai  returned  to  Alaska  in  May  1868,  and  in  1876  he  visited  St.

70  The  historical  record  supports  the  government  officials’  accusations,  although  it  doesn’t  justify  their 
use.  Especially  during  1950-63,  the  suggestion  that  someone  was  a  communist  or  communist  sym¬ 
pathizer  could  ruin  the  individual’s  reputation  and  career.  The  use  of  unsubstantiated  allegations  to

that  end,  especially  by  government  officials  and  certain  fraternal  organizations,  is  a  hallmark  of  one

on  Government  Operations,  vol.  4,  83rd  Cong.,  1st  sess.,  1953  (Washington,  DC:  GPO,  2003),  2878- 
82  (made  public  in  Jan.  2003).  Not  all  the  questions  and  answers  are  included  as  they  were  either  not 
related  to  the  subject  or  only  indirectly  related,  or  superfluous.  History  has  already  judged  Senator 
“Joe”  McCarthy  and  his  inquisition. 

Mr.  Cohn.  Do  you  know  a  Dr.  Samuel  Berenberg? 

Mr.  East.  Yes,  sir.  He  is  the  doctor  I  referred  to. 

Mr.  Cohn.  What  is  his  wife’s  name? 

Mr.  East.  His  wife’s  name,  I  believe,  was  Frederica  [sic]  Martin  Berenberg. 

Mr.  Cohn.  Was  Dr.  Berenberg  a  pretty  well-known  Communist  sympathizer? 

Mr.  East.  As  I  say,  looking  back  I  think  he  was. 

Mr.  Cohn.  What  was  his  connection  with  the  health  association? 

Mr.  East.  He  was  one  of  three  doctors  hired  by  the  association  to  practice  medicine. 

Mr.  Cohn.  Did  you  in  your  official  capacity  have  anything  to  do  with  his  employment? 

Mr.  East.  Not  originally.  It  does  happen  I  was  on  the  board.  He  was  in  Greenbelt  [Health  Association] 
two  different  times.  It  does  happen  I  was  on  the  board  when  he  was  hired  the  second  time.  He  had 
left  the  first  time  to  go  to  the  Pribilof  Islands  to  work  for  the  Department  of  the  Interior.  When  the 
war  came  on  the  Pribilofs  were  evacuated,  I  believe,  and  Greenbelt  was  without  a  physician.  We  were 
very  anxious  to  get  one  doctor  and  they  were  very  scarce.  He  was  available  and  I  was  on  the  board  that 
hired  him  back. 

Mr.  Cohn.  Now,  Mr.  East,  did  you  know  at  the  time  that  Dr.  Berenberg  was  a  Communist? 

Mr.  East.  I  certainly  did  not. 

Mr.  Cohn.  Had  he  ever  said  anything  to  lead  you  to  believe  he  was? 

Mr.  East.  Only  to  this  extent.  He  left  about  1939  and  up  until  that  time  it  had  never  entered  my  head 
that  he  was  a  Communist  sympathizer.  I  observed  later  that  his  attitude  towards  the  war  was  quite 
different  after  he  came  back  from  the  Pribilofs. 

Mr.  Cohn.  During  the  Hitler-Stalin  Pact  he  was  not  as  anxious  to  have  the  United  States  go  in? 

Mr.  East.  That  is  my  distinct  impression,  yes,  sir. 

Mr.  Cohn.  Did  you  ever  know  he  was  circulating  Communist  literature? 

Mr.  East.  He  never  circulated  any  to  me.  He  would  have  known,  I  hope  better. 

Mr.  Cohn.  Did  you  have  anything  to  do  with  his  [Berenberg’s]  leaving? 

Mr.  East. ...  He  resigned  of  his  own  free  will,  except  we  had  one  other  physician  at  the  time  and  they 
did  not  get  along  and  I  assume  that  is  one  of  the  reasons. 

Mr.  Cohn.  Now,  did  you,  yourself,  ever  give  a  lawn  party  for  the  benefit  of  the  Spanish  Loyalists? 

Mr.  East.  No,  I  did  not.  I  was  living  in  a  farm  house  . . .  and  I  allowed  my  premises  to  be  used  by  Mrs. 

Berenberg  to  hold  such  a  benefit  for  Spanish  refugees.  She  had  been  a  nurse  with  the  Spanish  Loyalists. 

Mr.  Cohn.  When  was  that? 

Mr.  East _ I  think  that  it  was  sometime  in  1949  or  1950,  but  I  don’t  know  for  sure. 

Mr.  Cohn.  Did  you  attend  the  party? 

Mr.  East.  I  did  not  know  it  was  held  under  the  auspices  of  any  organization  and  still  don’t  know  if  it 
was.  She  simply  said  she  would  like  to  do  something,  having  been  in  Spain,  she  said  she  would  like  to 
do  something  for  the  Spanish  refugees.  As  far  as  I  knew  it  was  a  personal  thing  with  her. 

Mr.  Cohn.  Now,  let  me  ask  you  this,  Mr.  East.  Based  on  the  facts  we  have  gone  over  here  in  connection 
with  your  appointment  of  Dr.  Berenberg  and  your  associations  with  other  people,  would  you  have 
considered  yourself  a  good  security  risk? 

Mr.  East.  I  most  certainly  would  have  then  and  I  would  now.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Mr.  Cohn.  In  connection  with  some  of  the  cases  you  passed  on  on  the  loyalty  board — I  am  not  asking 
you  for  any  names  or  about  any  individuals,  but  in  what  percentage  of  cases  you  passed  on  where  the 
allegation  was  Communist  activities  did  you  recommend  suspension? 

Mr.  East.  I  don’t  know.  I  mean  Communist  activities  is  a  very  broad  term.  I  have  no  idea  but  all  I  know 
is  that  I  acted  on  some  cases  where  we  did  recommend  some  suspensions.  I  acted  on  a  greater  number 
where  I  did  not  recommend  suspension.  When  I  say  I  acted,  1  acted  as  a  member  of  the  panel. 

Mr.  Cohn.  Isn’t  it  a  matter  of  fact  that  you  recommended  against  suspension  in  the  vast  majority  of 
cases? 

Mr.  East.  [To  Mr.  Adams— presumably  East’s  counsel]  Well  is  that  legitimate? 

Mr.  Cohn.  Mr.  East,  taking  everything  that  you  say  here  at  face  value  today,  I  think  it  still  might  suggest 
that  one  who  was  as  fooled  as  you  were  by  Communists  and  Communist  sympathizers  might  not  be 
in  a  position  to  evaluate  these  cases  with  understanding  and  perspicacity.  For  instance,  suppose  the 
case  of  Dr.  Berenberg  and  Mrs.  Berenberg  had  come  up.  They  apparently  fooled  you  once,  according 
to  your  own  statement  and  you  might  have  an  unfortunate  result  if  those  and  other  people  were  in 
sensitive  positions. 

Mr.  East.  They  did  not  fool  me  in  the  sense  you  are  using  the  term.  Secondly,  Berenberg  was  hired  as 
a  doctor.  He  was  a  good  one  no  matter  what  his  political  complexion  was  then,  now  or  ever  was,  and  1 
resent,  if  I  may  say  so,  the  implication  that  I  can’t  judge  when  a  man’s  political  complexion,  if  political 
is  the  right  word,  has  a  bearing  on  his  duties. 

Interestingly,  several  government  officials  characterized  the  Pribilofs  as  being  in  a  “communistic” 
state  of  affairs  long  before  Martin  and  her  husband  arrived  in  the  islands — e.g.,  George  Wardman, 

A  Trip  to  Alaska:  A  Narrative  (San  Francisco:  Samuel  Carlson,  1884),  109,  and  G  Dallas  Hanna,  The 
Alaska  Fur  Seal  Islands  (Washington,  DC:  GPO,  2008),  258. 

The  suggestion  that  the  Pribilof  Islands  were  communistic  dates  back  at  least  to  ca.  1879,  when 
former  Treasury  Agent  George  Wardman  (see  biography)  wrote  of  his  experiences  on  the  islands 
[A  Trip  to  Alaska:  A  Narrative,  109).  He  discussed  the  relationship  between  the  government  and 
the  commercial  company  monopoly  and  the  Natives  as  one  that  portended  a  “communistic  system.” 
Walter  Lembkey  wrote  the  following:  “The  system  involved  in  the  foregoing  arrangement  for  natives’ 
support  is  one  of  almost  pure  communism.  The  main  problem  confronting  those  charged  with  its 
conduct  was  to  support  the  people  in  such  comfort  and  happiness  as  the  resources  would  allow 
and  at  the  same  time  to  minimize  those  admitted  evils  of  communal  existence  which,  in  this  case, 
could  easily  result  in  reducing  the  island  inhabitants  to  a  mental  condition  of  stolid  apathy,  and  a 
physical  condition  of  virtual  peonage,  if  not  slavery.”  (Barton  W.  Evermann,  Alaska  Fisheries  and  Fur 
Industries  in  1913,  U.S.  Bureau  of  Fisheries,  Doc.  no.  797,  (Washington,  DC:  GPO,  1914),  141-8, 
under  the  subheading  “Support  of  Natives,  Problems  in  Communistic  System”).  Lembkey ’s  state¬ 
ment  was  reproduced  by  Osgood  et  al.  in  their  1914  publication  “The  fur  seals  and  other  life  of  the 
Pribilof  Islands,  Alaska,  in  1914,”  Bull,  of  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Fisheries  34,  134-8. 

Natural  historian  G  Dallas  Hanna,  in  The  Alaska  Fur-Seal  Islands,  258,  wrote:  “A  system  of  pure 
communism  has  been  maintained  upon  the  [Pribilof]  islands  since  1870.  From  1870  to  1879,  the 
village  was  paid  40  cents  for  each  sealskin  that  was  accepted  by  the  leasing  company.  The  gross  pro¬ 
ceeds  were  lumped  at  the  end  of  the  season  and  credited  on  the  books  of  the  company  to  the  village. 
The  division  of  this  sum  was  made  pro  rata  according  to  the  skill  of  the  individual.  The  individu¬ 
als  were  then  permitted  to  draw  from  the  company’s  store  the  amount  of  their  division  in  goods  at 
invoice  cost  plus  a  profit  varying  from  25  to  75  percent.” 

The  topic  of  communism  is  raised  in  this  endnote  to  clarify  the  record  and  not  to  impugn  Ms. 
Martin  or  Dr.  Berenberg,  who  can  be  considered  heroes  for  their  courage  and  the  strength  of  their 
efforts  to  better  the  lives  of  those  less  fortunate.

[In  1799,  Merkul  iev]  was  sailing  a  baidara  from  St.  George  to  St.  Paul,  with  a  large  group  of  men, 
when  they  were  carried  by  a  storm  to  the  Alaska  mainland.  Trying  to  land,  they  encountered  hostile 
\up  ik  (Central  Alaska  Eskimo)  warriors.  After  a  brief  encounter,  in  which  the  intruders  were  bested, 
Merkul’iev  was  forced  to  sail  on,  seeking  shelter  elsewhere.”

Netsvetov,  Iakov  (1804-1864) 

Born  and  raised  on  St.  George  Island 
First  Native  Alaskan  Russian  Orthodox  Priest 

Genealogy 

The  historical  record  provided  sufficient  circumstantial  evidence  to  Russian-American 
historian  Dr.  Lydia  Black  to  conclude  that  Iakov  Netsvetov  was  born  on  St.  George  Island 
in  1804.1  Iakov  was  the  son  of  Egor  (Georgii)  Vasil’evhich  Netsvetov  and  Mariia,  his  com¬ 
mon-law  wife,  from  Atkha.  The  couple  legally  wed  on  July  5,  1807.2  Egor  and  Mariia  had 
two  daughters,  Elena  and  Mariia,  and  three  sons,  Iakov,  Osip,  and  Anton.3  Circa  1826, 4 
Iakov  Netsvetov  married  Anna  (Semeonovna?),  a  Russian  from  the  Irkutsk  area,  born  in 
1808.5  Anna  died  March  19,  1836,  in  Sitka  at  age  28  of  uterine  cancer.  Iakov  died  July  26, 
1864,  also  in  Sitka.6  The  couple  had  no  children.7 

Biographical  Sketch 

Born  and  raised  on  St.  George  Island,  Iakov  Netsvetov  was  one  of  the  most  influential 
Creole  contributors  to  the  Unangan  entry  into  New  World  culture.  Iakov  Netsvetov’s 
father,  Egor,  was  an  employee  of  the  Russian-American  Company  (RAC)  who  eventu¬ 
ally  rose  in  rank  to  become  the  RAC  baidarshchik  (the  head  of  an  iqyax  hunting  party)8 
on  St.  George  Island.  Iakov  lived  with  his  family  on  St.  George  until  he  was  about  nine¬ 
teen.  When  his  father  retired  and  moved  the  family  to  Irkutsk,  Russia,  Iakov  studied  at 
the  theological  seminary  there.  Archbishop  Mikhail  of  Irkutsk  purportedly  groomed  the 
young  Iakov;  in  1826  he  was  made  deacon  at  the  Irkutsk  Trinity  St.  Peter  Church,  and 
in  1828  he  became  the  Atkha  (Atka,  among  the  Aleutian  Islands)  District  parish  priest.9 
While  in  the  Atkha  District  he  was  confronted  by  RAC  District  Manager  Petr  Egorovich 
Chistiakov,  who  opposed  interracial  marriages  and  presumably  the  elevated  social  status 
enjoyed  by  Creoles.  RAC  management  dissuaded  Chistiakov  from  pursuing  his  preju- 


491 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


dice,10  and  Father  Netsvetov  assumed  jurisdiction  over  the  RAC’s  school  at  Atkha.  By 
1841,  Father  Netsvetov  had  converted  it  to  a  church-run  school.  Among  his  students  was 
Innokentii  Shaiashnikov  (Shaiashnikoff),11  who  in  1848  became  the  first  full-time  resi¬ 
dent  priest  on  St.  Paul  Island. 

Father  Netsvetov  led  an  intellectually  and  physically  active  life.  He  collected  and 
prepared  fish  and  marine  mammal  specimens  for  the  museums  at  St.  Petersburg  and 
Moscow,  and  he  co-developed  with  Father  Ioann  (Ivan)  Veniaminov,  who  served  the 
church  at  Unalashka,  an  Aleut  script  that  included  the  various  Unangan  dialects.12 
Netsvetov  also  contributed  to  Veniaminov ’s  ethnography  of  the  Aleuts.  Separate  from 
Father  Veniaminov,  Netsvetov  translated  into  Aleut  the  Gospels  and  various  sermons, 
among  other  writings.  He  also  instructed  the  Aleut  community  in  church  music.13 

After  the  death  of  his  wife,  Father  Netsvetov  took  monastic  vows.  In  December 
1844,  he  accepted  a  missionary  assignment  to  the  Yukon,  accompanied  by  Innokentii 
Shaiashnikov,  Konstantin  Lukin,  and  a  nephew,  Vasilii  Netsvetov.14  Dr.  Lydia  Black  wrote: 

Thus  Netsvetov,  no  longer  young  . . .  learned  new  languages,  created  yet  another  script, 
built  another  Church,  and  another  Orthodox  community.  For  close  to  twenty  years,  until 
his  health  and  eyesight  failed  him,  he  continued  to  build  the  foundation  of  Orthodoxy  in 
Native  Alaska.  Finally,  in  1863,  he  was  relieved  and  brought  back  to  Sitka.15 

Father  Iakov  Netsvetov  kept  journals  during  his  vocation  in  the  Aleutians  and  the 
Yukon  that  are  conserved  within  the  Alaska  Church  Division,  Library  of  Congress,  in  the 
archives  of  the  Diocese  of  Sitka  and  Alaska,  and  at  St.  Herman’s  Theological  Seminary, 
Kodiak.16 

Father  Netsvetov  was  buried  at  the  entrance  to  Holy  Trinity  Church,  a  Tlingit  church, 
at  Sitka.  This  church  no  longer  exists.17

My  place  of  residence  since  May,  1891,  has  been  Seattle,  Washington.  For  a  period  of 
nineteen  years  prior  to  that  date  I  was  resident  of  the  State  of  Minnesota.  My  occupation 
was  that  of  a  real  estate  and  investment  broker.  In  the  autumn  of  1889  I  went  to  the  island 
of  St.  Paul,  one  of  the  Pribilof  group,  as  a  special  agent  of  the  Treasury  Department.  In 
August,  1890, 1  returned  to  the  States  and  stayed  until  the  spring  of  1891,  when  I  returned 
to  said  island  of  St.  Paul.  I  remained  there  during  the  months  of  June  and  July  of  that  year, 
and  was  then  transferred  to  the  island  of  St.  George,  where  I  remained  until  June,  1892.20 

Newspaper  Story 

After  Stiles  Nettleton  arrived  home  in  July  1892,  he  was  interviewed  by  the  New  York 
Times  about  the  scarcity  of  seals  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  and  about  his  experiences  as  a 
Seal  Islands  agent. 

Seattle,  Washington,  July  14  -  S.R.  Nettleton,  who  for  two  seasons  has  been  special  agent 
of  the  Treasury  Department  on  the  Pribilof  Islands,  has  arrived  in  this  city  having  come 
down  from  Bering  Sea  on  the  Albatross,  the  ship  of  the  United  States  Fish  Commission. 

Mr.  Nettleton’s  knowledge  of  the  sealing  business,  and  of  the  situation  at  the  two  great 
rookeries,  or  breeding  places,  of  the  seal  in  the  Bering  Sea,  is  full  and  exact,  for  he  spent 
one  year  as  the  Government’s  agent  at  St.  Paul,  and  his  second  year  as  the  agent  at  St. 

George.  He  left  the  islands  on  June  10,  and  he  says  that  up  to  the  time  of  his  departure  but 
few  seals  had  made  their  appearance. 

As  a  rule,  the  rookeries  are  pretty’  well  occupied  by  the  first  week  in  June,  but  this  year  so 
few  seals  had  come  that  the  place  was  practically  deserted.  The  winter,  however,  has  been 
unusually  backward,  and  everything  is  behind;  so  it  may  be  that  later  the  seals  will  come 
along  as  usual.  The  vessels  of  the  Government  fleet  were  instructed  to  take  particular 
notice  of  the  presence  of  seals  in  the  waters  of  the  Pacific  Ocean  between  Cape  Flattery  and 
the  Aleutian  Islands.  In  making  the  cruise  each  vessel  was  assigned  a  certain  route,  so  that 


493 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


a  large  area  of  the  North  Pacific  was  covered,  and  without  exception  the  reports  from  the 
vessels  show  that  the  seals  are  uncommonly  scarce.  None  at  all  are  seen  west  of  Kadiak  [sic] 

Island,  a  fact  considered  by  seal  experts  as  remarkable. 

In  speaking  of  the  matter  Mr.  Nettleton  says:  There  is  no  disguising  the  truth  that  the 
seals  are  rapidly  disappearing.  The  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  which  once  had  the 
lease  of  the  business  on  the  islands,  was  allowed  to  kill  100,000  annually,  but  two  years 
ago  the  North  American  Commercial  Company,  which  secured  the  lease  at  that  time,  was 
restricted  to  60,000.  In  that  year,  however,  the  company  could  find  but  32,000  seals.  Last 
year,  according  to  an  agreement  with  Great  Britain,  but  7,500  were  to  be  killed  as  food  for 
the  natives.  How  many  there  will  be  this  season  I  cannot  tell,  though,  as  I  have  said,  the 
indications  are  not  promising. 

The  only  way  I  can  account  for  the  disappearance  of  the  animals  is  their  destruction  by 
the  sealers  in  the  North  Pacific  and  Bering  Sea.  During  the  last  few  years  the  raids  on  the 
rookeries  have  taken  but  few  animals,  but  the  sealing  fleet,  which  now  numbers  122  vessels, 
follows  the  seals  along  the  coast  of  California,  Oregon,  and  Washington,  across  from  the 
Straits  of  Fuca  to  Unimak  Pass  and  into  Bering  Sea  killing  thousands  of  them,  the  females 
heavy  with  young  are  slower  and  clumsier  than  the  males  and  spend  more  time  in  resting 
on  the  surface  of  the  water.  Thus  it  happens  that  these  are  more  likely  than  any  others  of 
the  herd  to  fall  a  prey  to  the  sealers,  and  each  slaughter  of  a  mother  means  the  death  of  two 
seals. 

When  the  pups  are  born  at  the  rookeries  the  mothers  leave  them  after  a  few  days  to  go  to 
the  fishing  grounds  for  food.  The  poachers  watch  for  the  mothers  on  these  trips,  and  when 
the  female  is  killed  the  little  pup  dies  on  the  rocks  of  St.  Paul  or  St.  George. 

If  the  sealers  are  put  out  of  Bering  Sea  by  the  United  States,  they  will  yet  remain  in  the 
North  Pacific  Ocean  to  carry  on  the  work  of  destruction.  The  only  way  they  can  be  put  off 
the  ocean  is  by  an  international  agreement.  Before  such  an  arrangement  as  that  is  reached  I 
fear  that  all  the  seals  will  be  killed. 

In  speaking  of  the  islands  Mr.  Nettleton  said:  The  weather  is  unpleasant  there  because  a 
heavy  fog  prevails  nearly  all  the  time.  I  suppose  that  we  do  not  have  more  than  thirty  clear 
days  in  the  course  of  a  whole  year.  The  climate  is  not  severe,  for  during  my  first  Winter, 
when  I  was  at  St.  Paul  Island,  the  thermometer  only  went  to  9  degrees  above  zero  on  our 
coldest  day,  but  last  Winter,  on  St.  George,  the  temperature  fell  to  11  degrees  below. 

There  are  now  about  200  natives,  Aleuts,  on  St.  Paul  and  100  on  St.  George.  They  are 
peaceful  and  inoffensive  people.  During  my  residence  on  the  islands  I  was  the  sole 
representative  of  law  and  authority,  and  yet  I  had  no  difficulty  whatever  in  maintaining 
order.  The  Aleuts  there  are  not  so  debauched  and  diseased  as  the  natives  on  the  mainland 
of  Alaska,  and  still  they  are  very  fond  of  a  vile  beer  they  brew.  We  have  had  to  restrict  the 
amount  of  sugar  and  molasses  they  buy,  for  they  will  use  these  materials  for  making  their 
beer.21 

Mrs.  Nettleton  taught  school  on  St.  George  during  her  husband’s  tenure  as  an  as¬ 
sistant  agent.22

Genealogy 

Gustave  Ferdinand  Nybom  (Niebaum)  was 
born  on  August  31,  1842,  at  Helsingfors  (now 
Helsinki),  Finland  to  Gustaf  Nybom,  “a  police 
official  of  Swedish  and  Baltic-German  stock,”24 
and  Anna  Johanna  (Nyman)  Nybom  (b.  circa 
1909;  m.  November  18,  1838).  Gustaf  Nybom 
died  August  24,  1846  of  lungsot  (tuberculosis).25 
According  to  biographer  Wilson  Fiske  Erskine, 

Nybom  changed  the  spelling  of  his  name  to  the 
German  “Niebaum”  because  he  thought  it  ap¬ 
peared  more  American  and  German  Jewish  and 
would  make  a  more  positive  impression  upon 
businessmen  Louis  Sloss,  Louis  Gerstle,  and 
August  Wasserman,  with  whom  Nybom  negoti¬ 
ated  his  terms  for  what  would  become  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company.26 

Biographer  Erskine  makes  a  telling  observa- 
,  -  ,  Gustaf  F.  Nybom.  ( Gun-Marie  Wiis/ 

tion  about  Niebaum  s  rise  from  social  ignorance:  Swedish  Finn  Historical  Society.) 

Niebaum  had  been  born  in  Helsingfors  when  Finland  was  a  semi-independent  Grand 
Duchy.  He  was  a  descendant  of  people  known  for  their  aggressiveness,  hardihood, 
independence  of  spirit,  and  avoidance  of  Jews.  When  he  discovered  that  a  considerable 
portion  of  the  financial  district  of  San  Francisco  was  peopled  by  Jews,  he  was  at  first 
skeptical  about  approaching  any  of  them.  In  later  years  he  laughed  about  this  and  admitted 
that  he  knew  nothing  about  them  aside  from  traditions  from  his  home  country.27 

Niebaum  had  one  son,  Alexander  Alexis,  or  “Nick,”  born  in  Alaska  in  April  1865. 
Gustave’s  wife  died  while  Nick  was  very  young,  so  when  Nick  was  about  15,  his  father  “gave 
the  youth  into  custody  of  Dr.  Hugh  H.  McIntyre  [Superintendent,  Alaska  Commercial 
Company  on  St.  Paul  Island]  to  bring  him  to  Vermont.  Nick  attended  the  local  high 
school  in  Vermont,  and  later  the  University  of  Vermont  and  Princeton.”28 

In  1873  Niebaum  was  married  a  second  time,  to  German-American  Suzanne 
Shingleberger  (aka  Susan  and  Susie;  died  March  1 936), 29  daughter  of  William  Prancis 
Shingleberger  and  Leah  Prances  (Stevens)  Shingleberger  of  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania. 
Gustave  Niebaum  died  August  5,  1908. 30  Gustave  and  Susan  had  no  children;  five  years 
after  Gustave’s  death,  Susan  Niebaum  assumed  responsibility  for  her  brother’s  children.31

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Biographical  Sketch 

After  graduating  in  1858  from  a  gymnasium,  Europe’s  equivalent  of  an  American  high 
school,  Gustave  Nybom  became  a  cabin  boy  on  a  Russian-American  Company  ship  sail¬ 
ing  to  Alaska.32  He  enrolled  in  Helsinki’s  Nautical  Institute  after  returning  home,  and 
graduated  from  the  institute  at  nineteen.  He  secured  his  master’s  papers  and  in  1864,  at 
the  age  of  twenty-two,  commanded  a  ship  also  in  the  service  of  the  Russian-American 
Company  sailing  to  Alaska.33  Nybom  became  a  citizen  of  the  United  States  under  the 
provisions  of  Article  III  of  the  Treaty  of  Cession,34  and  during  that  time  he  changed  the 
spelling  of  his  name  to  “Niebaum.” 

Gustave  Niebaum  became  a  multimillionaire  as  a  result  of  his  Pribilof  Islands  business 
dealings.  He  applied  this  wealth  and  his  business  acumen  to  fulfilling  his  dreams.  In  1880, 
for  $48,000,  Gustave  and  Suzanne  purchased  the  Inglenook,  a  marginally  successful  sani¬ 
tarium  and  vineyard  in  Rutherford,  California,  in  the  Napa  Valley,  along  with  numerous 
adjacent  parcels  of  land  totaling  1,000  acres.  Gustave’s  intention  for  the  property  was  to 
own  a  world-class  winery.  He  hired  Hamden  McIntyre,  an  engineer  who  built  the  Pribilof 
Islands  sealing  plant  and  who  also  had  extensive  viticulture  experience.  In  1881,  McIntyre 
became  Inglenook’s  first  resident  general  manager;  he  proceeded  to  design  and  construct 
the  estate’s  first  winery  and  cellars.  Within  this  outstanding  physical  plant,  “Niebaum 
aged  his  wine  more  than  his  competitors,  and  he  pioneered  estate  bottling.  Instead  of 
selling  his  wine  to  wholesalers  in  bulk  (casks),  as  was  the  custom,  he  sold  only  ‘in  glass.’ 
Every  bottle  bore  his  distinctive  label  and  logo,  plus  a  branded  cork  secured  with  wire.”35 

In  1964,  Niebaum’s  heirs  sold  the  Inglenook  estate  to  United  Vintners,  who  subse¬ 
quently  sold  to  Alcoholic  Beverages  of  Heublein,  Inc.  In  1975,  filmmaker  Francis  Ford 
Coppola  purchased  the  Niebaum  home  and  a  small  portion  of  the  vineyard,  but  the 
larger  Inglenook  vineyard  remained  with  Heublein.  Both  Coppola  and  Heublein  offered 
wine  collections  named  after  Gustave  Niebaum.36  By  the  1990s,  Francis  Ford  Coppola 
and  his  wife  Eleanor  had  acquired  the  entire  Niebaum  estate  and  winery  and  formed  the 
Niebaum-Coppola  Estate  Winery,  Napa  Valley,  California.  In  2008,  under  the  Rubicon 
label,  the  Coppolas  continue  to  follow  Niebaum’s  dream  of  a  world-class  winery. 

Because  he  treated  the  winery  as  a  hobby  and  not  a  business,  Niebaum  never  profited 
from  it.37 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Gustave  Niebaum  provided  his  deposition,  excerpted  below,  to  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration 
on  May  13,  1892,  before  Clement  Bennett  at  San  Francisco,  California. 

I  am  50  years  old,  a  resident  of  San  Francisco  and  a  merchant  and  ship  owner. 

I  was  born  in  Helsingfors,  Finland,  and  became  an  American  citizen  by  the  transfer  of 
Alaska  to  the  United  States.  I  entered  the  service  of  the  Russian-American  Commercial 
[sic]  Company  in  1858,  and  was  in  command  of  one  of  their  vessels  from  1866  until  the 
cession  of  Alaska  to  the  United  States.  I  am,  and  have  been  for  several  years  past,  vice- 
president  and  a  director  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  and  a  member  of  the  firm 
of  Hutchinson,  Kohl  &  Co.,  the  former  lessees,  respectively,  of  the  Alaska  and  Siberian 
sealeries.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


In  these  various  positions  the  care  and  management  of  seal  rookeries  and  system  and 
methods  of  killing  seals  and  curing  and  transporting  their  skins  to  market  has  been  my 
study.  I  visited  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  1867  and  had  charge  of  seal  killing  there  in  1868  and 
1869.  When  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  obtained  the  lease  in  1870,  of  the  right  to 
take  seals  for  their  skins,  I  instructed  the  superintendent  and  agents  of  the  company  in 
regard  to  the  way  in  which  the  work  should  be  done,  and  outlined  to  them  the  policy  to  be 
pursued  in  the  future.38 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Gustave  Nybom  was  in  Victoria,  British  Columbia,  during  the  winter  of  1866,  when  news 
of  the  possible  Alaska  purchase  first  appeared  in  newspapers.  He  returned  to  Sitka  the 
next  spring  and  resigned  his  position  with  the  Russian-American  Company.  With  four 
of  his  old  comrades  he  formed  a  business  called  Hansen,  Nybom  &  Co.  which  included 
partners  Alexander  Hansen  and  O.  Osche.39  In  1885,  he  recalled: 

We  prepared  ourselves  for  sea  as  soon  as  we  could  and  left  there  in  November  sometime. 

Went  to  the  westward  for  the  purpose  of  landing  on  the  Seal  Islands.  We  landed  on  St. 

Pauls’  [sic]  Island  after  a  good  deal  of  trouble  and  marched  ashore  in  a  snow  storm  on 
Christmas  Eve  [1867].40  Up  to  that  date  it  had  been  considered  impossible  to  sail  there  as 
late  in  the  season  as  that.  I  had  taken  the  trouble  to  inform  myself  on  this  point  the  year 
previous  and  found  it  was  possible  to  reach  there  by  that  time.  We  made  arrangements 
immediately  on  landing  there  to  establish  a  trading  post  and  leave  a  man  in  charge  and 
commence  sealing  operations  for  the  coming  season.  We  succeeded  in  getting  about  10,000 
seal  skins  and  left  them  and  went  to  Ounalaska  and  established  a  trading  post  there.  From 
there  I  went  to  Unga  and  from  there  San  Francisco.41 

“The  documents  on  file  in  the  Customs  House  of  San  Francisco  report  the  entry  of 
the  brig  Constantine  of  122.57  register  tons,42  on  March  2,  1867  .  .  .  Captain  Gustave 
Ferdinand  Nybom  owner.”43  Nybom  and  the  Constantine  arrived  at  the  docks  of  San 
Francisco  on  March  2,  1867,  after  first  acquiring  the  sealskins  from  the  Pribilof  Islands 
prior  to  the  formal  acquisition  of  the  territory  by  the  Americans.  The  brig  was  laden 
with  valuable  cargo  including  “land  and  pelagic  seal  furs,  pickled  salmon,  hides,  etc.  The 
cargo  represented  a  cross  section  of  the  products  that  had  attracted  the  Russians  to  North 
America  one  hundred  years  or  more  before.  .  .  .  Surviving  records  show  the  combined 
value  of  sea  otter,  seal,  fox,  ermine  and  other  skins,  and  numerous  casks  of  salted  and 
pickled  fish  to  be  approximately  $600,000.00,  an  imposing  sum  and  a  sizeable  sample.”44 

Gustave  Nybom  returned  to  the  Pribilofs  in  1868  with  great  expectations  for  secur¬ 
ing  more  windfall  profits  but  learned  that  others  had  landed  on  the  islands  with  the  same 
intentions.  The  times  must  have  been  particularly  stressful  for  the  Aleuts  who  were  ex¬ 
pected  to  undertake  the  harvesting  for  these  piratical  entrepreneurs,  although  reportedly 
the  Natives  were  paid  for  their  labor  (about  35  cents  per  sealskin).  Nybom,  at  six  feet 
two  and  a  half  inches  and  of  Viking  bearing,45  proved  himself  a  formidable  adversary.  He 
purchased  132,000  pelts  on  St.  Paul  and  65,000  on  St.  George.46  The  competition  waned 
in  1869  through  successful  lobbying  by  Hayward  Hutchinson  to  have  the  islands  con¬ 
trolled  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  War  and  the  Treasury  Department.  Niebaum,  formerly 
Nybom,  became  a  significant  shareholder,  along  with  Hayward  Hutchinson,  in  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company.47

Luman  A.  Noyes  was  born  on  January  26,  1840,  in  Tunbridge,  Orange  County,  Vermont, 
to  Stephen  Noyes  and  Julia  A.  (Gushia)  Noyes.  He  enlisted  as  an  assistant  surgeon  with 
the  Union  Army  in  April  1863  and  served  for  one  month.  Luman  Noyes  and  Louise  R. 
Boyle  were  married  in  1865,  at  Chelsea,  Vermont,  and  settled  in  Randolph,  Vermont. 
Luman  and  Louise  had  two  daughters,  Blanch  and  Anna,  both  born  in  Vermont.48 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Luman  Noyes  deposed  before  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  June  11,  1892,  before 
Treasury  Agent-in-Charge  William  H.  Williams  at  St.  George  Island,  Alaska.  Excerpts 
follow: 

I  am  a  native  American,  and  my  home  is  in  Randolph,  VT.  I  am  52  years  of  age  and  a 
physician  by  profession. 

In  1880  I  entered  the  service  of  the  lessees  of  the  Pribilof  Islands  as  resident  physician  at 
the  seal  islands,  and  I  have  resided  here  continuously  ever  since,  excepting  an  occasional 
visit  to  my  home,  for  a  few  months  in  winter,  once  or  twice  since  1880. 

From  June  1880  to  August  1883, 1  was  on  St.  George  and  from  1883  to  1884  I  was  on  St. 

Paul  Island.  I  then  returned  to  St.  George,  where  I  have  resided  ever  since. . . . 

In  addition  to  my  services  as  physician,  I  have  occasionally  taught  the  school  on  St. 

George,  and  I  have  kept  the  books  and  accounts  for  many  years  for  the  lessees  on  the  same 
island  . . .  and  I  acted  as  assistant  special  agent. 

In  winter  the  islands  are  sometimes  surrounded  by  broken  ice,  which  comes  from  the 
north,  and  it  will  come  and  go  with  the  tide  and  currents,  generally  from  January  to  April, 
but  occasionally  remaining  later,  and  again  not  appearing  at  all. 

The  most  experienced  men  do  the  skinning,  and  after  them  come  the  women  and  children 
who  carry  off  the  carcasses  for  food,  and  the  fat  or  blubber  for  winter  fuel.49 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

In  1883,  Assistant  Treasury  Agent  J.  P.  Manchester  had  hired  on  with  the  understanding 
of  Acting  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  Charles  S.  Fairchild  that  he  could  return  home  at  the 
end  of  the  sealing  season  on  St.  George  Island.  Likewise,  Agent-in-Charge  George  Tingle 
and  Assistant  Agent-in-Charge  T.  F.  Ryan,  also  on  St.  George,  had  intended  to  take  leave 
at  the  end  of  the  1883  season,  but  Agent  Tingle  had  not  the  authority  to  grant  or  deny 
leave.50 

In  the  dilemma  and  without  any  authority  of  law,  but  relying  on  the  authority  contained 

in  your  letter  of  April  30 _ I  appointed  Dr.  L.A.  Noyes,  a  Democrat  in  politics,  acting 

assistant  Treasury  agent,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  and

Collections,  Chichester  Coll.,  HDC263,  neg.  034957.) 


placed  him  in  charge  of  St.  George  Island.  Dr.  Noyes  is  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company’s 
physician  on  this  island,  and  was  an  applicant  for  the  vacant  assistant  Treasury  agency  at 
the  time  Mr.  Manchester  was  appointed.  His  application,  he  informs  me,  was  indorsed  by, 
among  others,  Hon.  B.B.  Smalley  and  Hon.  Hiram  Atkins,  of  Vermont. 

I  regard  it  as  a  fortunate  circumstance  that  a  proper  and  available  man  was  here  whom 
I  could  secure  to  go  to  St.  George  and  assume  the  duties  of  the  office,  as  it  will  not  do 
to  leave  the  islands  without  someone  whom  the  natives  are  accustomed  to  call  “the 
Government.”  I  therefore  hope  my  action  in  the  premises  will  be  approved  and  that  some 
authority  of  law  will  be  found  to  pay  Dr.  Noyes  for  his  services  until  he  is  relieved  from  duty 
by  the  return  of  the  absent  Treasury  agents  or  the  order  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury.51 

Congressman  Foster  of  Vermont  submitted  consideration  for  Noyes’  claim,  which 
stated  in  part: 

Dr.  Noyes  reluctantly  accepted  the  appointment,  for  he  had  been  eighteen  months  away 
from  home.  The  appointment  was  made  in  due  form  and  he  took  the  oath  of  office.  He 
removed  from  St  Paul  to  St.  George  and  performed  duty  from  August  1,  1886,  to  June  1, 

1887,  a  period  of  ten  months,  which  at  $2,190  per  annum  ($6  per  day),  the  regular  pay  of 
Treasury  agents  at  that  time,  would  amount  to  $1,819,  no  part  of  which  sum  he  has  ever 
received.52 

Dr.  Hugh  H.  McIntyre  sent  several  letters  justifying  and  urging  the  government  to 
make  good  on  its  agent’s  promise  to  pay  Dr.  Noyes  for  providing  government  oversight

He  accepted  Mr.  Tingle’s  offer  very  reluctantly,  and  did  so  only  upon  his  [Tingle’s] 
assurance  that  he  would  surely  be  paid  by  the  Department  for  his  service.  In  giving  this 
assurance,  Mr.  Tingle  relied  upon  the  precedent  established  in  1870,  when  Special  Treasury 
Agent  Charles  Bryant  appointed  Samuel  Falconer  acting  assistant  agent  in  the  same  place 
where  Dr.  Noyes  was  afterwards  stationed  and  under  similar  circumstances.  In  this  case  the 
appointment  of  Mr.  Falconer  was  recognized  by  the  Department  as  a  necessity,  and  he  was 
duly  paid  for  his  services.53 

The  issue  of  Dr.  Noyes’  pay  received  considerable  attention,  with  supporters,  detrac¬ 
tors,  and  attorneys  weighing  in  on  the  question  over  at  least  a  five-year  period.  Legal 
counsel  opined  several  times,  as  exemplified  by  Treasury  Acting  Solicitor  F.  A.  Reeve: 

The  appointment,  though  irregular,  could  now  be  approved  by  the  Secretary  of  the 
Treasury  if,  in  the  first  instance,  he  had  the  authority  of  law  to  make  the  same. . . . 

Section  1760,  Revised  Statutes,  directs  that  “No  money  shall  be  paid  from  the  Treasury  to 
any  person  acting  or  assuming  to  act  as  an  officer,  civil,  military,  or  existing  law,  unless  such 
office  is  subsequently  sanctioned  by  law.54

Reeve,  like  others,  regretfully  concluded  that  Dr.  Noyes  could  not  be  paid  by  the  gov¬ 
ernment.55  The  last  correspondence  the  present  authors  examined  on  the  matter,  dated 
February  14,  1893,  came  from  Acting  Treasury  Secretary  O.  L.  Spaulding,  who  support¬ 
ed  the  introduction  of  legislation  (H.R.  8756)  to  provide  Dr.  Noyes  with  his  just  due  as 
Acting  Assistant  Treasury  Agent  during  1886-1887.56 

Following  his  temporary  duty  as  Acting  Assistant  Agent  on  St.  George  Island,  Dr. 
Noyes  continued  his  position  as  physician  on  St.  George  with  the  Alaska  Commercial 
Company.  In  1890,  he  joined  the  new  island  lessee  on  St.  George,  the  North  American 
Commercial  Company,  which  he  served  until  his  resignation  in  August  1905.’

whether  the  hunting  was  conducted  on  land  or  on  the  water.  The  authors  make  the  assumption 
that  Netsvetov  was  referred  to  as  a  baidarshchik  for  his  role  in  land-harvesting  seals,  as  they  did 
not  find  any  reference  to  seal  hunting  from  an  iqyax  on  the  Pribilofs.  Basil  Dmytryshyn  and  E.  A.  P.

Member,  1914  Commission  to  Study  Fur-Seal  Herds  on  Pribilof  Islands 
Curator  of  Birds  and  Mammals,  Field  Museum  of  Natural  History 

Genealogy 

Wilfred  H.  Osgood  was  born  on  December  8,  1875,  at  Rochester, 

New  Hampshire,  to  Marion  Hudson  Osgood,  a  watchmaker,  and 
his  wife,  Harriet  Amanda  (Hacker)  Osgood.  Wilfred  was  one  of 
five  siblings.  The  others  were  Alice  (became  Mrs.  Alice  Gay),  C. 

Sumner,  Hattibel,  and  Marion  (married  Kenneth  Dowie).  Wilfred 
Osgood  died  “after  a  short  illness”  at  the  Billings  Memorial 
Hospital,  Chicago,  Illinois,  June  20,  1947. 1 

Biographical  Sketch 

The  Osgood  family  left  New  Hampshire  for  California  in  1883, 
while  Wilfred  was  still  a  young  boy.  He  received  his  education  at 
Stanford  University,  where  he  majored  in  fishery  science  under  David  Starr  Jordan.  He 
graduated  in  1899  and  earned  a  PhD  from  the  University  of  Chicago  in  1918. 

Dr.  Osgood  was  a  biologist  with  the  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture,  Bureau 
of  Biological  Survey  from  1897  to  1909  and  had  charge  of  the  United  States  biological 
investigation  in  Alaska  from  1899  to  1909.  He  left  that  position  to  become  assistant  curator 
and  within  twelve  years  he  was  chief  curator  in  the  Department  of  Zoology  with  the  Field 
Museum  of  Natural  History  at  Chicago,  Illinois. 

He  was  recognized  as  one  of  the  country’s  leading  zoologists,  specializing  in  the  field  of 
mammals  and  also  was  a  lexicographer  and  contributor  to  encyclopedias.2 

Osgood  was  the  author  of  205  publications.  He  died  in  1947.3

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Wilfred  Osgood  was  appointed  by  Secretary 
of  Commerce  William  C.  Redfield  as  one  of  a 
three-member  scientific  team  representing  the 
United  States  in  1914  to  study  the  northern  fur- 
seal  herds.  The  other  U.S.  team  members  were 
George  H.  Parker  of  Harvard  University  and 
Edward  A.  Preble,  Bureau  of  Biological  Survey, 
Department  of  Agriculture.  The  three  men 
were  nominated  by  prestigious  institutions  and 
selected  by  the  government  foremost  because 
they  had  not  been  “in  any  way  concerned  with 
fur  seals  or  the  fur-seal  controversy.”  These  men 
were  directed  “to  ascertain  the  actual  state  of  the 
Alaskan  seal  herd  in  1914,  and  to  make  that  con¬ 
dition  known  to  the  department,  with  recommendations  touching  all  important  admin¬ 
istrative  matters  growing  out  of  the  international,  economic,  and  biological  relations  of 
the  seal  herd.”4  They  proceeded  as  temporary  special  assistants  of  the  Bureau  of  Fisheries 
to  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  the  summer  of  1914  and  were  joined  by  James  Macoun  and  B.  W. 
Harmon  of  Canada  and  Dr.  T.  Kitahara  of  Japan.5  Osgood,  Preble,  and  Parker  published 
their  findings  in  “The  Fur  Seals  and  Other  Fife  of  the  Pribilof  Islands,  Alaska  in  1914.” 

The  majority  of  the  U.S.  team’s  report  focused  on  Pribilof  Islands  fur  seals  and  other 
wildlife,  but  fifteen  pages  spoke  of  the  Aleut  population  on  the  islands,  as  directed  by  the 
Secretary  of  Commerce:

Biographies  O  ♦  Osgood  -  Otis 


So  as  your  other  duties  permit,  I  am  particularly  desirous  that  you  should  give  attention  to 
the  native  inhabitants  and  determine  what  changes,  if  any,  should  be  made  in  the  relations 
of  the  Government  to  their  social,  educational,  sanitary,  business,  and  other  interests.6 

Following  are  the  conclusions  drawn  from  “The  Natives”  section  of  the  team’s 
report. 

It  will  be  seen  from  the  foregoing  account  that  the  people  of  the  Pribilof  Islands,  though 
not  natives,  have  for  so  long  made  the  islands  their  home  that  they  know  and  recognize 
no  other.  They  are  a  people  still  in  a  state  of  semicivilization,  and  considering  their  limited 
environment  they  seem  to  be  as  well  able  to  embrace  its  advantages  and  as  successful  in 
combating  its  disadvantages  as  is  usual  among  such  peoples.  They  constitute  a  heritage 
acquired  by  the  United  States  with  the  islands  and  their  valuable  wild  inhabitants,  and 
considerations  of  economy  and  of  humanity  demand  that  they  be  accepted  as  such 
and  managed  with  all  possible  wisdom  and  fairness.  Many  of  the  details  of  the  present 
system  of  dealing  with  them  are  survivals  of  the  past,  and  the  conditions  under  which 
they  developed  are  no  longer  existent.  Many  changes  and  improvements  have  been 
recommended  by  the  agents  and  other  officials,  but  in  most  cases  they  have  not  been 
accomplished,  either  on  account  of  controversy,  sudden  and  radical  changes  of  regime,  or 
small  appropriations.  Many  changes  in  the  methods  of  dealing  with  the  natives  seem  to  be 
necessary.  Such  changes  should  be  instituted  gradually,  and  in  such  a  way  that  the  native 
will  be  able  to  perceive  their  fairness  and  expediency.  In  some  respects  they  deserve  more 
liberal  treatment;  in  others  they  must  be  dealt  with  more  firmly.  In  their  management  a 
great  deal  will  depend  on  the  personality  of  the  officials  in  charge. 

The  changes  in  methods  which  seem  desirable  have  been  pointed  out  in  the  foregoing 
pages.  It  is  believed  that  the  work  necessary  to  put  the  sealing  plan  on  an  efficient  basis  and 
the  resumption  in  the  near  future  of  commercial  sealing,  accompanied  by  a  better  system 
of  compensation,  and  the  opportunity  of  exchanging  the  reward  of  their  labor  according 
to  their  desires  will  help  to  make  the  native  self-respecting  and  gradually  lead  to  their 
betterment  in  many  directions.  By  such  course  the  people  of  the  islands  may  become  an 
entirely  self-supporting,  efficient,  and  happy  community.7 

Osgood  and  his  team  accomplished  what  Secretary  Redfield  had  requested,  but 
Redfield  did  not  necessarily  care  to  carry  out  all  of  their  recommendations.  The  former 
Commissioner  of  the  Fur-Seal  Commission,  Dr.  David  Starr  Jordan,  put  forward  his 
thoughts  on  Redfield’s  stance. 

Their  carefully  prepared  report  agreed  in  every  respect  with  the  findings  of  previous 
commissions,  but  Redfield  paid  no  attention  to  its  recommendations.  I  need  go  no  further 
into  these  details.  They  afford  but  one  more  example  of  the  failure  of  a  certain  class  of 
officials  to  take  advantage  of  expert  knowledge.8

Brevet  Lieut.  Col.  Harrison  Gray  Otis  is  the  son  of  Stephen  and  Sarah  [Dyer9]  Otis,  who 
were  pioneer  citizens  of  Ohio,  and  was  born  near  Marietta  [Ohio]  February  10,  1837.  In 
the  year  1800  his  father,  at  the  age  of  sixteen,  emigrated  to  the  far  West  from  Vermont

and  settled  in  the  “Ohio  Company’s  Purchase”  at 
Marietta,  then  just  emerging  from  the  condition 
of  a  frontier  “blockhouse”  post.  His  mother  was  a 
native  of  Nova  Scotia. . .  .10 

Mrs.  Otis,  who  is  a  leading  member  of  the  [Los 
Angeles]  Times’  staff,  was  Miss  Eliza  A.  Wetherby 
[Eliza  Ann  Weatherbee11].  She  married  Mr.  Otis  at 
Lowell,  Ohio,  September  11,  1859.  They  have  three 
daughters  living:  Mrs.  Lilian  [sic]  Otis  McPherron, 
of  Redlands;  Miss  Marian  Otis,  secretary  of  the 
Times-Mirror  Company,  and  Mrs.  Mabel  Otis 
Booth,  of  Berkeley,  Cal.12 

Harrison’s  wife,  Eliza  Wetherby,  was  born  to 
Nancy  Hyde  and  Charles  Thomas  Weatherbee  on 
August  16,  1833,  in  Walpole,  Cheshire  County, 
New  Hampshire.13  Harrison  and  Eliza  had  five 
children:  Harrison  Gray  (born  May  1861;  died 
December  1861);  Beulah  Lillian  (born  September 
22,  1864;  died  1925);  Emma  Marian  (born  July  1, 
1866;  died  September  8,  1952);  Mabel  (born  May 
28,  1871,  died  1955);  and  Esther  (died  1875).  Eliza  Otis  died  November  12,  1904,  at  Los 
Angeles,  California.  Harrison  G.  Otis  Sr.  died  July  30,  1917,  at  the  age  of  80,  at  Hollywood, 
Los  Angeles,  California.14 

Biographical  Sketch 

Harrison  Gray  Otis  received  a  “log-schoolhouse”  education  up  to  the  age  of  fourteen, 
when  he  became  a  printer’s  apprentice.15  He  worked  at  this  trade  in  various  places.  Soon 
after  the  start  of  the  Civil  War  (aka  “War  of  the  Rebellion’’),  young  Otis  enrolled  in  the 
Union  Army  as  a  private  with  the  Twelfth  Ohio  Volunteers.  In  1864,  he  transferred  to  the 
Twenty-third  Ohio  Veteran  Volunteers.  Twice  wounded  in  battle,  he  became  a  brevetted 
major  and  lieutenant-colonel.16 

In  1867,  Otis  moved  to  Washington,  D.C.,  where  he  became  a  government  official 
and  then  a  correspondent,  editor,  and  foreman  (1869-70)  at  the  Government  Printing 
Office.  In  1876,  he  again  moved  his  family,  this  time  to  California,  where  he  assumed 
control  of  the  Santa  Barbara  Daily  Press ,17  From  1879  to  1882  he  was  special  agent-in¬ 
charge  in  the  Seal  Islands. 

In  1882,  Harrison  Gray  Otis  took  a  position  as  editor  of  the  Los  Angeles  Daily  Times 
and  Weekly  Mirror,  which  he  eventually  purchased  and  renamed,  as  the  Times-Mirror 
Company.  He  assumed  the  roles  of  president,  general  manager,  editor,  and  publisher,18 
and  became  one  of  the  most  influential  men  of  California. 

Otis  bequeathed  his  Wilshire  Boulevard  home  to  the  City  of  Los  Angeles  for  use  in 
the  advancement  of  the  arts.  Until  1997,  the  site  housed  the  Otis  Art  Institute  (of  Parsons 
School  of  Design19),  now  re-located  to  West  Los  Angeles  and  known  as  the  Otis  College 
of  Art  and  Design.20

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Harrison  Otis  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  April  25,  1892,  before  Notary 
Public  Frederick  Harkness  at  Los  Angeles,  California.  Following  is  an  excerpt: 

I  am  resident  of  this,  the  city  of  Los  Angeles,  California;  am  president  of  the  Times-Mirror 
Company,  and  editor  and  manager  of  the  Los  Angeles  Daily  Times.  I  was  special  agent  of 
the  Treasury  Department,  in  charge  of  the  fur-seal  islands  of  Alaska  during  the  years  1879, 

1880,  and  1881,  and  had  three  assistant  special  agents  stationed  at  the  islands,  acting  under 
my  directions.  During  these  years  I  was  present  at  the  islands  throughout  each  sealing 
season,  having  my  headquarters  on  the  island  of  St.  Paul,  and  visiting  the  smaller  island  of 
St.  George  each  season,  and  with  my  assistants  personally  superintended  the  catch  of  seals 
and  the  count  and  shipment  of  skins  in  each  instance  . . .  during  my  term  of  service  at  the 
island  I  made  careful  and  elaborate  reports  each  year  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury.21 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Harrison  Otis  arrived  at  the  Pribilof  Islands  on  May  27,  1879,  to  serve  as  the  Special 
Agent-in-Charge.  He  arrived  aboard  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  (ACC)  steamship 
St.  Paul,  with  assistant  agents  B.  F.  Scribner  and  John  W.  Beaman,  husband  of  Elizabeth 
“Libby”  Beaman.2-* 1  Otis  was  the  agent  whom  Libby  Beaman  refused  to  identify  in  her 
diary,  published  years  later  by  granddaughter  Betty  John  under  the  title  Libby.  One  of 
Libby’s  first  diary  entries  regarding  the  agent-in-charge  says  so,  but  doesn’t  say  why: 

“Well,  Beaman,”  he  [Otis]  said  gruffly,  "you  did  bring  your  wife  after  all.  I  should  like  to 
meet  her.” 

I  could  scarcely  believe  John  when  he  introduced  me  to  his  immediate  superior  officer,  the 
Treasury  Department  senior  agent,  the  man  to  whom  John  will  be  junior  agent  on  the  Seal 
Islands,  the  man  with  whom  we  have  to  share  our  lives  for  the  next  two  years.  Though  John 
introduced  him  by  name,  I  never  shall  name  him.  He  will  remain  the  Senior  Agent,  SA,  no 
matter  what  happens.23 

Within  a  day  of  Otis’  arrival  at  St.  Paul  Island  he  seized  the  schooner  Loleta24  for 
carrying  illicit  goods  including  “a  large  quantity  of  arms,  ammunition,  and  distilled  spir¬ 
its.”2’  Otis  sent  the  schooner  to  Unalaska  with  an  officer  to  await  the  arrival  of  the  cutter 
Richard  Rush  26  The  threat  of  marauders  must  have  plagued  him,  for  his  reports  included 
numerous  references  of  vigilance  on  the  matter. 

It  will  be  necessary  ...  in  order  to  effectively  watch  Otter  Island,  to  have  the  special  agents 
furnished  with  a  suitable  boat  and  at  least  two  men  to  man  it.  These  might  be  supplied  by 
the  cutter,  and  can  be  returned  to  it  when  she  touches  at  the  island  for  the  last  time  in  the 
fall.  I  recommend  this  course,  and  ask  that  the  necessary  instructions  be  given.27 

Otis’  annual  report  dated  July  30,  1880,  stated  that  the  ACC  had  installed  telephone 
service  between  St.  Paul  village  and  the  largest  rookery  at  Northeast  Point,  where  the 
islanders  thought  marauders  would  most  likely  launch  an  assault,  but  that  no  marauders 
had  appeared  around  St.  Paul  Island  during  the  reporting  period.28  However,  while  the 
islanders  observed  no  pirates,  at  least  one,  Captain  Adolphe  F.  Carlson  of  the  schooner 
Alexander,  stealthily  claimed  300  sealskins  from  Otter  Island.29  On  July  4,  1881,  Agent 
Otis  submitted  a  detailed  report  on  “the  movements  and  operations  of  suspected  and 
marauding  vessels.”30  The  motivation  behind  what  would  become  an  increasing  surge  of 
sealing  piracy  was  the  increasing  value  of  landed  seal  pelts  from  $3  to  $10  each.  ’1 


509 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


The  omnipresent  fear  of  marauder  predations  upon  the  Seal  Islands  apparently  con¬ 
tinued  to  weigh  heavily  on  the  mind  of  the  agent-in-charge  despite  the  apparent  low  in¬ 
cidence  of  such  events.  In  1882,  during  an  off-island  holiday  celebrated  at  Santa  Barbara, 
California,  Otis  wrote: 

Sir:  I  have  the  honor  to  present  for  your  consideration  and  action  the  following  matters 
pertaining  to  the  seal  islands  of  Alaska,  etc.: 

I.  Otter  Island.— This  island,  lying  about  6  miles  off  the  southwest  end  of  St.  Paul  Island, 
and  not  embraced  within  the  terms  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company’s  lease  [a  point 
presented  many  times  in  the  past]  is  the  resort,  annually,  from  June  to  November,  of  some 
thousands  of  (non-breeding)  fur  seals,  which  haul  up  from  the  sea  to  rest  and  play  upon  its 
rocky  shores.  They  appear  to  be  simply  the  overplus  [surplus]  from  the  larger  island,  and 
are  mainly  males,  both  young  and  old.  It  is  believed  that  from  5,000  to  10,000  marketable 
skins  might  be  taken  there  annually,  if  there  were  any  authority  for  doing  so,  and  the 
tendency  is  for  the  seals  to  steadily  increase  in  numbers  there.32 

It  was  formerly  the  practice  of  certain  subordinates  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  to 
go  to  Otter  Island  in  boats  and  drive  the  seals  found  there  into  the  sea,  the  object  being  to 
discourage  their  coming  to  that  island  and  force  them  to  concentrate  upon  St.  Paul  Island, 
where  the  greater  part  of  the  fur-seal  skins  are  taken. 

The  device,  even  if  it  were  legitimate,  of  driving  the  seals  from  Otter  Island  for  the 
pretended  purpose  of  taking  away  the  attraction  for  marauders  to  make  descents  upon  the 
island,  is  a  futile  one,  because  the  seals  persistently  return  after  a  few  hours  and  can  not  be 
kept  away  except  by  a  degree  of  harassment  which  is  warranted  by  neither  law  nor  good 
policy. 

I  submit  the  whole  subject  to  you,  asking  specific  directions  for  the  future,  which  shall  be 
binding  alike  upon  Treasury  agents,  the  lessees,  and  all  concerned. 

II.  Protection  of  the  seal  islands. — In  this  connection  I  have  the  honor  to  renew  my 
recommendation  that  Congress  be  asked  for  an  appropriation  to  build  a  suitable  vessel  to 
be  used  for  the  protection  of  Otter  Island  and  the  seal  fisheries  against  lawless  intruders. 

At  present  the  revenue  steamer,  which  cruises  in  Alaskan  waters,  is  able  to  make  no  more 
than  two  or  three  brief  calls  at  the  islands  during  the  entire  season,  covering  a  period  of  not 
less  than  five  months,  during  which  the  sensitive  seal  rookeries  are  practically  at  the  mercy 
of  marauding  vessels,  so  far  as  any  means  of  repelling  them  on  water  are  concerned,  for 
the  Government  officers  at  the  islands  have  no  such  means  at  [their]  command,  not  even  a 
whaleboat. 

I  think  the  policy  of  furnishing  a  small  and  inexpensive,  though  swift  and  effective,  steam 
vessel  for  this  purpose  would  be  in  the  interest  of  true  economy,  for  it  would  secure  the 
complete  protection  of  these  priceless  resorts  of  the  fur  seal,  and  at  the  same  time  relieve 
the  revenue  steamers  entirely  from  the  necessity  of  cruising  in  the  immediate  waters.33 

Agent  Otis’  military  background  might  be  seen  to  come  through  in  his  efforts  to  deal 
with  the  marauders.  He  also  had  to  deal  with  island  administrative  matters.  For  example: 

I  am  asked  by  the  native  chiefs  of  St.  Paul  Island  to  present  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury 
the  case  of  one  Kassian  Shaisnekoff,  a  temporary  resident  of  the  island,  who  has  never 
been  admitted  to  the  privilege  of  participating  in  the  work  of  sealing  for  the  reason  that, 
though  a  native  of  the  island  he  was  living  away  from  it  (at  Unalaska)  when  the  country 
came  into  the  possession  of  the  United  States.  He  subsequently  returned  to  the  island  as 
a  temporary  laborer,  and  at  his  own  request  (and  being  a  brother  to  the  local  priests)  was 
permitted  to  remain  on  sufferance,  but  was  ruled  out  as  a  sealer  by  my  predecessor,  Mr. 

Morton,  in  common  with  other  natives  who  had  been  permitted  to  come  to  the  island 
simply  as  temporary  laborers  under  authority  of  the  Department.  Shaisnekoff  has  been 
given  miscellaneous  employment  by  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  and  at  the  close  of 


510 


Biographies  O  ♦  Otis  -  Notes 


each  sealing  season  has  generally  been  presented  with  the  sum  of  $100  by  the  people,  out 
of  their  sealing  fund.  I  would  recommend  that  the  request  made  in  his  behalf  be  granted, 
were  it  not  for  the  fact  that  it  would  constitute  a  precedent  for  the  return  of  several  natives 
of  St.  George  Island  who  have  never  lived  there  since  the  transfer  of  the  country,  and  whose 
advent  at  this  late  period,  in  the  capacity  of  sealers,  would  doubtless  be  construed  as  an 
injustice  to  the  people  who  have  the  prescriptive  right  to  take  seals,  and  who  would  be  sure 
to  strenuously  object  to  the  newcomers.  I  think  this  claim  in  behalf  of  Shaisnekoff  would 
not  have  been  urged  were  it  not  for  his  relationship  to  the  local  priests.  I,  however,  report 
the  case  to  you  as  it  is,  and  await  your  decision  thereon.34 


Oustigoff,  Simeon 

Guard,  St.  George  Island 
Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Simeon  Oustigoff  was  one  of  the  many  Aleuts  on  St.  George  Island  sent  to  guard  the  seal 
rookeries  against  marauders. 

Simeon  Oustigoff  and  Innokenty  Rezanzoff,  who  were  sent  to  Zapadnie  Rookery  June  21, 
as  guards,  returned  today— the  service  of  each  being  8  days,  which,  at  the  $1.50  per  day, 
amounts  to  $12.00,  with  which  they  have,  respectively,  been  duly  credited.  They  brought  in 
pelts  of  two  seals  killed  for  food,  which  weighed  7  pounds  each,  and  were  accepted  by  the 
agent  of  the  N.A.C.  Company.35

Member,  1914  Commission  to  Study  Fur-Seal  Herds  on  Pribilof  Islands 
Professor  of  Zoology,  Harvard  University 

Genealogy 

George  Howard  Parker  was  born  at  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania,  on  December  23,  1864, 
to  George  Washington  Parker  and  Martha  (Taylor)  Parker.  George  Parker  married  Louise 
M.  Stabler  (1868-1954),  a  Barnard  College  graduate,  in  1895.  They  had  no  children. 
George  Parker  died  on  March  26,  1955,  at  Cambridge,  Massachusetts.1 

Biographical  Sketch 

George  Parker  graduated  from  Harvard  University  in  1891  with  a  Doctor  of  Science 
degree.  He  rose  from  the  rank  of  teacher  to  that  of  full  professor  of  zoology,  a  post  he 
held  until  1935. 

Professor  Parker  retired  in  1935  but  carried  on  his  research  work  for  another  twelve  years. 

In  1948  he  published  a  major  work  on  animal  color  changes.  He  was  among  the  nation’s 
first  experimental  zoologists.  His  work  developed  understanding  of  the  nervous  systems 
and  sense  organs  of  animals. ...  He  was  an  associate  of  the  Marine  Biological  Laboratory  at 
Woods  Hole  almost  from  its  beginning  and  had  spent  his  summers  there  in  research.2 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

George  H.  Parker’s  reflections  as  a  zoologist  chronicled  his  experiences  with  the  Pribilof 
Islands’  fur  seals  (Parker,  The  World  Expands,  1946).  He  pointedly  targeted  the  “politics” 
of  what  otherwise  should  have  been  a  purely  scientific  undertaking.  Controversy  between 
politics  and  science  surfaced  an  untold  number  of  times  during  the  government  man¬ 
agement  period.  Parker  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  on  June  21,  1914,  and  wrote  about  the 
experience  years  later:

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


It  is  a  fact  often  forgotten  that  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  which  came  into  being  in 
1863  under  President  Lincoln,  was  established  as  a  scientific  advisory  body  to  the  United 
States  government.  In  pursuance  of  this  capacity  I  was  nominated  by  the  then  president  of 
the  Academy,  Dr.  [William  Henry]  Welch,  the  year  after  I  became  a  member  [1914],  to  be 
one  of  three  investigators  to  proceed  to  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  the  Bering  Sea  to  report  to 
the  federal  authorities  on  the  number  and  condition  of  the  government  fur  seals  on  these 
islands.  Thus  my  election  to  one  of  the  most  distinguished  scientific  bodies  in  the  land 
brought  me  at  once  into  a  responsible  position  for  counting  seals.3 

After  the  discovery  of  the  breeding  grounds  of  the  Alaskan  fur  seals  by  the  Russian 
navigators  the  herd  from  time  to  time  suffered  serious  depletions  from  which,  however, 
recovery  was  always  made  as  a  result  of  restrictive  killing.  A  serious  diminution  in  the  size 
of  the  herd  was  reached  under  American  management  at  the  beginning  of  this  century. 

On  investigation  it  was  declared  that  this  diminution  was  due  chiefly  to  pelagic  sealing. 

This  kind  of  sealing  was  carried  on  in  the  open  sea  in  summer  and  far  enough  away  from 
the  Pribilof  Islands  to  be  legal.  It  resulted,  however,  in  the  killing  of  large  numbers  of  cow 
seals,  for  these  were  the  class  of  seal  in  the  open  sea  at  that  season.  The  killing  of  a  cow  seal 
at  that  time  of  year  was  most  destructive  to  the  herd,  for  it  meant  not  only  her  loss,  but 
the  loss  of  the  unborn  pup  in  her  body  and  the  death  by  starvation  of  her  newly  born  pup 
temporarily  left  by  her  in  the  rookery  on  the  beach.  Those  who  practiced  pelagic  sealing 
were  chiefly  American,  British,  and  Japanese  sealers.  After  a  conference  of  representatives 
of  these  three  nations  in  Washington,  D.C.,  it  was  agreed  to  make  pelagic  sealing  illegal 
for  the  nationals  of  these  countries  and  to  give  the  herd  a  chance  to  recuperate  if  pelagic 
sealing  was  the  cause  of  the  reduction  in  numbers.  The  annual  count  of  seals  as  made  by 
the  government  agents  on  the  two  seal  islands  consequently  came  to  be  a  matter  of  great 
moment.  After  this  enumeration  had  been  in  force,  it  was  claimed  on  the  floor  of  Congress, 
by  those  who  disbelieved  that  pelagic  sealing  was  accountable  for  the  diminution  of  the 
herd,  that  the  reported  numbers  for  the  herd  made  by  the  island  agents  were  falsified 
and  that  the  favorable  signs  seen  in  the  claimed  increase  of  the  herd  on  the  cessation  of 
pelagic  sealing  was  fictitious.  President  Wilson  was  therefore  authorized  to  send  three 
investigators  to  the  seal  islands  in  1914  to  make  an  impartial  count  of  the  seals  and  to 
report  back  to  Congress.  The  persons  selected  for  this  undertaking  were  Mr.  W.O.  Osgood, 
nominated  by  the  Smithsonian  Institution,  Mr.  E.A.  Preble,  nominated  by  the  United  States 
Department  of  Agriculture,  and  myself,  nominated  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences. 
Shortly  after  the  organization  of  the  group,  we  met  in  Washington  with  Mr.  [William]  C. 
Redfield,  secretary  of  the  Department  of  Commerce,  for  a  general  conference.  The  outcome 
of  this  meeting  was  a  request  on  the  part  of  the  secretary  that  he  wished  a  report  returned 
by  us  which  we  all  could  agree  upon,  and  not  a  split  report  with  each  one  expressing  his 
own  views.  As  our  report  was  to  turn  mainly  on  an  enumeration  of  seals  it  seemed  to 
me  that  the  secretary’s  admonition  savored  rather  of  politics  than  of  scientific  integrity, 
for  we  all  three  entertained  no  doubts  about  our  ability  to  count  and  to  tell  the  truth. 

Before  we  started  on  our  way  to  the  Pribilofs  we  learned  that  we  were  to  have  companion 
investigators  from  the  other  nations  concerned:  from  Great  Britain  Mr.  James  M.  Macoun 
of  the  Geological  Survey  of  Canada  and  Mr.  B.W.  Harmon  of  the  Dominion  Department 
of  Marine  and  Fisheries,  and  from  Japan,  Dr.  T.  Kitahara  of  the  Imperial  Japanese  Fisheries 
Bureau.  Thus  the  party  totaled  six,  and  while  the  three  from  the  United  States  were  the 
official  reporting  members  it  may  be  said  here  in  anticipation  that  not  only  these  three  but 
all  six  of  the  party  signed  the  enumerations  of  seals  reported,  a  conclusion  which  marks  the 
difference  between  what  a  politician  may  anticipate  as  the  outcome  of  an  effort  and  what 
reputable  scientists  may  contribute  to  it.4 

Professor  Parker  continued  his  story  about  the  Pribilofs: 

The  island  of  St.  Paul,  like  that  of  its  brother  island,  St.  George,  is  without  a  harbor.  We  and 
our  belongings  were  landed  at  an  open  stone  wharf  and  from  there  we  walked  the  quarter 
of  a  mile  or  so  into  the  native  village.  This  consisted  of  about  two  or  three  wide  lanes  with 
rows  of  one  story  three  room  frame  houses  arranged  in  orderly  sequence.  The  government 
house  and  the  store  toward  which  we  went  were  double-decked  frame  constructions.

Not  a  soul  was  to  be  seen.  We  were  somewhat  surprised,  but  we  at  least  found  a  man  at 
the  government  house  who  told  us  that  the  whole  village  had  gone  to  the  carpenter  shop, 
the  largest  building  there,  to  see  the  first  moving  picture  show  which  had  ever  come  to 
the  island.  A  few  days  before  our  arrival  a  United  States  naval  vessel  had  put  in  to  set  in 
order  the  new  radio  station  just  then  erected  for  the  island.  [The  radio  station  was  actually 
constructed  in  1911.]  This  vessel  carried  a  portable  moving-picture  outfit,  and  as  a  special 
and  novel  treat  to  the  natives  this  outfit  had  been  brought  on  the  island  and  all  in  the  village 
had  been  invited  to  come  to  the  show.  Hence  the  absence  of  life  about  the  settlement.  We 
dropped  our  bags  at  the  government  house  and  went  in  a  body  to  the  carpenter  shop.  The 
population  of  the  village  of  St.  Paul  was  then  a  little  fewer  than  two  hundred,  and  this  whole 
congregation  was  crowded  together  into  the  carpenter  shop  to  see  the  pictures.  We  were 
evidently  in  time  to  view  most  of  the  film,  which  consisted  largely  of  views  of  New  York 
with  vessels  in  the  harbor,  skyscrapers,  crowded  street  scenes,  Central  Park  views,  railroad 
trains  on  the  elevated  and  on  the  surface,  all  of  which  seemed  very  familiar  to  us.  At  the 
end  of  the  show  the  native  chief  [Elary  Stepetin]  was  brought  to  us  and  introduced.  He  was 
an  intelligent,  well-dressed  man  of  middle  age  who  had  been  elected  by  the  other  natives 
on  the  island  to  his  post  and  who  spoke  simple  English.  After  having  met  us  he  returned 
to  those  in  the  shop,  told  them  in  the  Aleut  language  who  we  were,  and  then  asked  us  if  we 
wished  to  speak  to  the  villagers  or  ask  anything  of  them.  I  was  pushed  forward  and  spoke  a 
few  words  of  greeting,  which  was  translated  by  the  chief  into  Aleut,  and  then  I  asked  him 
what  had  been  of  most  interest  to  the  villagers  in  the  movie  which  they  had  just  looked  at. 
There  was  much  buzzing  consultation,  after  which  he  said  they  were  most  interested  to  see 
that  trees  moved  in  the  wind  and  that  their  branches  were  not  stiff  and  rigid  as  they  had 
heretofore  thought.  We  then  learned  that  there  were  no  trees  on  the  island,  that,  in  fact,  the 
nearest  trees  were  at  Dutch  harbor  some  hundred  miles  away  and  that  few  or  none  of  the 
natives  had  ever  been  off  St.  Paul.  The  only  trees  that  they  ever  had  seen  were  occasional 
trunks  with  a  few  stiff,  leafless  branches  on  them  which  had  been  washed  from  the  Alaskan 
mainland  to  their  island.  Thus  we  began  to  learn  the  psychology  of  this  isolated,  Russian- 
Aleut,  half-breed  population. 

The  school  teacher  on  the  island5,  a  very  intelligent  American,  who,  with  his  wife,  did  what 
they  could  for  the  welfare  of  the  natives,  complained  of  the  circumstances  under  which 
he  had  to  work.  He  told  us  that  the  United  States  government  sent  him  a  stock  of  primers 
to  use  in  his  school  in  which  a  picture  of  an  object  was  given  and  below  it  its  name  in 
English.  There  would  be  a  picture  of  a  dog,  with  the  name  dog  spelled  out  below,  a  horse,  a 
cow,  and  so  on.  “But  what  am  I  to  do  with  such  a  book,”  asked  he,  “when  not  one  of  these 
things  exists  on  the  island?  It  is  not  surprising,”  he  said,  “to  hear  the  natives  complain  of 
the  English  language  as  a  very  impractical  one,  because  in  learning  it  they  are  expected  to 
remember  so  many  things  which  they  have  never  seen.”  I  asked  him  what  he  regarded  as 
the  outcome  of  his  three  or  four  years  of  teaching,  and  he  said  sorrowfully  that  it  amounted 
to  bringing  the  pupil  to  the  point  of  saying  yes  or  no  to  very  simple  questions  that  might 
be  asked  of  him.  When  I  looked  at  the  educational  problem  that  this  poor  man  had  to  face 
day  in  and  day  out  I  felt  that  my  difficulties  in  trying  to  teach  Harvard  students,  bad  as  the 
results  commonly  were,  amounted  to  nothing  compared  with  those  of  my  distant  colleague 
on  the  Pribilofs. . .  .6 

. . .  we  settled  in  the  village  of  St.  Paul  at  the  government  house  and  began  to  watch  the 
coming  of  the  bulls  on  Gorbatch  Rookery,  the  nearest  rookery  to  the  village.  In  all  there 
were  about  a  dozen  rookeries  on  St.  Paul  [Island]  but  we  could  know  what  was  occurring 
on  all  of  them  by  watching  Gorbatch,  the  one  nearest  at  hand.  This  occupied  about  half 
a  mile  of  very  stony  beach  and  day  by  day  more  bulls  took  positions  on  it.  Soon  the  cows 
began  to  appear,  and  shortly  after  that  we  saw  the  first  pups  born.  Soon  after  the  middle 
of  July  we  assumed  that  all  the  breeding  bulls  had  arrived  and  we  began  to  count  them. 

This  was  an  easy  undertaking  for  the  bulls  kept  their  places  on  the  beach,  were  large, 
conspicuous  creatures,  and  lifted  themselves  well  above  the  other  seals.  It  was  like  counting 
telegraph-poles  as  one  walks  along  a  telegraph  line.  All  six  of  us  walked  together  along  the 
bluff  above  Gorbatch  and  counted,  one  by  one,  the  breeding  bulls,  agreeing  on  a  total  of 
112.  In  about  a  week  we  had  thus  counted  all  the  breeding  bulls  in  the  twelve  rookeries  on 


515 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


St.  Paul  and  in  the  six  on  St.  George  and  obtained  a  grand  total  of  1,559,  an  enumeration 
probably  accurate  to  within  one  or  two  percent.  A  week  or  so  later  we  essayed  counting  the 
pups.  At  this  time  in  the  summer,  about  the  end  of  July,  the  cows  can  be  easily  driven  into 
the  sea,  the  bulls  will  remain  at  their  old  locations,  and  the  pups  are  strong  enough  to  be 
herded  to  one  end  of  a  given  rookery.  From  this  region  they  can  then  be  allowed  to  return 
to  the  rookery  in  narrow  files  and  can  be  counted  as  they  pass  a  pair  of  enumerators  for 
each  file.  This  count  cannot  be  so  accurate  as  the  count  of  bulls,  but  it  must  be  very  close. 
Gorbatch  Rookery  yielded  6,152  pups,  and  the  count  for  both  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  gave 
a  grand  total  of  93,250. ...  So  the  enumeration  of  the  fur-seal  herd,  which  might  seem  at 
first  sight  an  insoluble  problem,  was  at  last  accomplished  and  with  a  grand  total  of  about 
294,000  individuals.  This  total  figure  confirmed  the  enumerations  of  the  keepers  on  the 
islands  for  previous  years  and  showed  that,  contrary  to  what  had  been  said  from  the  floor 
of  Congress,  the  herd,  now  that  pelagic  sealing  had  almost  entirely  been  eliminated,  was 
increasing  and  that  the  increase  was  such  as  to  warrant  the  expectation  of  a  rapid  recovery. 
This  expectation  has  been  fully  realized,  for  the  total  herd  of  fur  seals  which  numbered 
somewhat  over  a  quarter  of  a  million  in  1914  is  now,  in  1943,  estimated  as  some  two  and 
three-quarter  millions.  The  enumeration  of  the  Pribilof  fur  seals  for  1914  having  been 
completed,  I  left  the  islands  on  the  revenue  cutter  Tahoma  which  picked  me  up  at  St.  Paul 
on  August  6  and  started  me  on  my  return  trip  home  by  way  of  California/

During  President  Fillmore’s  administration,  he 
was  the  second  Comptroller  of  the  Currency. 

From  that  time  until  1885,  though  active  in  public 
life  as  an  orator  and  a  lawyer,  he  held  no  public 
office,  but  devoted  himself  to  law. ...  In  1880  he 
was  president  of  the  American  Bar  Association. 

...  In  1881  he  became  Kent  Professor  of  Law  at 
Yale.14 

Phelps  held  this  position  at  Yale  until  his 
death. 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration 

Edward  John  Phelps  served  as  senior  counsel  to 
the  United  States  in  1893  in  the  Bering  Sea  con¬ 
troversy  with  Great  Britain,15  better  known  as  the 
Fur-Seal  Arbitration  (1892-93).  Under  appoint¬ 
ment  by  President  Benjamin  Harrison,  Phelps 
supported  the  U.S.  representatives,  Supreme 
Court  Justice  John  M.  Harlan,  and  Senator  John 
T.  Morgan.  Phelps  presented  the  eleven-day  closing  argument,16  which  included  an  ex¬ 
haustive  review  of  the  U.S.  case  for  jurisdiction  over  the  Bering  Sea  and  a  call  for  protec¬ 
tion  of  the  seal  herd  from  pelagic  sealing.  Phelps  was  not  new  to  the  international  scene. 
President  Grover  Cleveland  had  appointed  him  as  U.S.  minister  to  Great  Britain’s  Court 
of  St.  James17  from  1885  to  1889.  Before  the  hearings  in  Paris,  Phelps  wrote  an  essay  titled 
“The  Behring  Sea  Controversy,”  which  appeared  in  the  April  1891  issue  of  Harper’s  New 
Monthly  Magazine  and  later  in  a  collection  of  Phelps’  orations  and  essays.18  The  following 
are  excerpts  from  the  essay  that  served  as  his  summary  argument: 

The  question  involved  in  what  is  called  the  Behring  Sea  controversy  may  be  stated  in  few 
words.  The  Alaskan  fur-seal  fishery  is  the  most  important  in  the  world.  It  was  a  material 
element  in  the  value  of  that  province  when  purchased  by  the  United  States  from  Russia,  at 
a  heavy  cost,  and  one  of  the  principal  inducements  upon  which  the  purchase  was  made.19 
Since  Alaska  became  the  property  of  the  United  States,  this  fishery  has  afforded  a  very 
considerable  revenue  to  the  government  by  the  lease  of  its  privilege,  has  engaged  a  large 
amount  of  American  capital,  and  the  industry  of  many  American  people. . . . 

The  Secretary  of  State  in  his  last  (published)  communication  to  the  British  government  on 
this  subject  makes  the  following  statement:  “From  1870  to  1890,  the  seal  fisheries  carefully 
guarded  and  preserved,  yielded  100,000  skins  each  year.  The  Canadian  intrusions  began  in 
1886  and  so  great  has  been  the  damage  resulting  from  their  destruction  of  seal  life  in  the 
open  sea  surrounding  the  Pribyloff  [sic]  Islands,  that  in  1890  the  government  of  the  United 
States  limited  the  Alaska  Company  to  60,000  skins,  but  the  company  was  able  to  secure 
only  21,000  seals.”20 

The  Secretary  of  State,  in  his  correspondence  with  the  British  government . . .  has 
undertaken  to  maintain  that  these  waters  are  not ...  a  part  of  the  high  or  open  sea  ...  21 

There  are  three  methods  by  which  the  Behring  Sea  question  can  be  settled,  and  by  one  or 
other  of  which  it  must  soon  be  disposed  of:  first,  by  putting  a  stop  without  further  debate 
to  the  depredations  of  individual  foreigners  upon  the  breeding  seals;  second,  by  conceding 
to  these  foreigners  the  right  to  destroy  the  fishery,  and  withdrawing  further  remonstrance; 
third,  by  continuing  the  discussion  with  Great  Britain  of  the  abstract  questions  supposed  to

thereby  exhausted,  for  which  we  shall  not  have  long  to  wait.  If  the  last  course  is  taken,  the

before  the  Tribunal  regarding  seals,  sealing,  and  the  history  of  the  Pribilof  Islands,  the 
U.S.  arguments  failed  to  sway  the  Tribunal.  For  example,  and  not  surprisingly,  the  United 
States  lost  its  contest  for  exclusive  control,  i.e.  mare  clausum  (closed  sea)  of  the  Bering 
Sea.  More  disappointingly,  pelagic  sealers  retained  their  right  to  hunt  the  seal  within  the 
Bering  Sea,  although  they  were  restricted  from  sealing  closer  than  sixty  nautical  miles  of 
the  Pribilof  Islands.  Regardless,  enforcement  efforts  were  marginal,  the  northern  fur-seal 
herd  continued  to  decline,  and  some  sealers  continued  to  raid  the  islands.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Philemonof,  Anthony  (1952-2009) 

President,  Tanadgusix  Corporation 
Biographical  Sketch 

Anthony  Philemonof  was  born  July  14,  1952,  on  St.  Paul  Island  to  Terenty  and  Alexandra 
PhilemonofF.  He  graduated  from  Mt.  Edgecombe  High  School  in  1971  and  furthered 
his  education  at  Alaska  Methodist  University  (now  Alaska  Pacific  University).  In  1977, 
Anthony  met  Rebecca  Melovidov.  In  the  summer  of  2008,  with  their  five  children,  they 
celebrated  their  thirtieth  wedding  anniversary. 

Anthony  was  a  true  born  leader,  like  his  father  before  him.  He  was  a  defender  and  advocate 
for  the  legal  and  economic  rights  of  the  Aleut  people.  After  a  brief  stint  at  college,  Anthony 
joined  the  Native  Land  claims  movement.  While  working  first  for  the  Alaska  Federation  of 
Natives  (AFN)  and  then  later  with  the  Aleut  League,  he  traveled  to  all  the  Aleut  Villages  to 
help  them  to  be  legally  recorded  as  official  Alaska  Native  Village  Corporations.  Anthony 
then  moved  back  home  to  St.  Paul  Island  to  help  incorporate  his  own  village.  There  he 
served  as  a  Board  of  Director  for  Tanadgusix  (TDX)  Corporation  for  33  years,  and  went 
on  to  serve  as  its  President  for  24  continuous  years  until  his  death  in  2009.  During  that 
time  Anthony  helped  start  the  commercial  fisheries  enterprise  on  the  island  as  one  of 
the  first  captains  of  a  commercial  halibut  boat  out  of  St.  Paul.  He  and  other  leaders  of  St. 

Paul  fought  and  lobbied  for  equal  access  to  the  abundant  fishing  resources  around  Bering 
Sea  communities.  His  actions  helped  lead  to  securing  rights  to  fish  quotas  for  Bering  Sea 
Villages,  now  known  as  the  CDQ  [Community  Development  Quota]  program.  Anthony 
continued  his  drive  to  help  his  people  by  also  serving  on  the  Council  for  the  St.  Paul  Tribe 
and  the  City  Council,  and  he  worked  for  the  Pribilof  Islands  School  District.  Of  all  of 
his  efforts,  Anthony  was  most  proud  of  his  leadership  at  the  Village  Corporation,  TDX. 

He  never  varied  from  being  the  defender  of  his  home  land  and  his  fight  for  economic 
and  legal  independence  for  his  people.  Along  with  his  board  and  his  management  team 
he  helped  take  TDX  from  a  little  Village  Corporation  doing  just  $70,000  in  revenue  to  a 
diversified  business  doing  over  $70,000,000  in  revenue;  with  hotels  in  Anchorage,  Seattle 
and  Portland,  an  office  building  in  Hawaii,  power  plants  in  Dead  Horse,  Sand  Point  and  the 
biggest  wind-diesel  power  plant  in  Alaska  on  St  Paul  Island.  One  project  that  was  dear  to 
Anthony  was  TDX’s  private  dock  in  the  St.  Paul  harbor.  The  dock  led  to  the  construction  of 
the  biggest  crab  processing  plant  built  and  operated  in  the  Bering  Sea.  Everyone  that  got  to 
know  Anthony  grew  to  love  him  for  his  intelligence,  sense  of  humor,  and  dedication  to  his 
family  and  the  people  of  St.  Paul  Island.23

Pribylov,  Gavriil  (Gabriel)  Loginovich  (d.  1796) 

Russian  Navy  Navigator,  Russian  Discoverer  of  St.  George  Island,  1 786 
Genealogy 

Gavriil  Loginovich  Pribylov  was  the  son  of  Loginovich  Prybilov,  a  Cossack  from  Okhotsk.25 
Some  claim  that  Gavriil  Pribylov  died  in  Sitka,26  and  others  believe  he  died  at  Okhotsk.27 
“Our  veteran  skipper  Pribylov  died  in  March,  1796.  Prior  to  his  death  he  took  a  vessel 
with  a  transport  of  settlers  and  hunters  to  Yakutat  (Bering)  Bay,  but  got  only  as  far  as 
Chugach  Bay  and  turned  back.”28  Prybilov  was  buried  on  Kodiak  Island,  Alaska.29 

The  name  Gavriil  Loginovich  Pribylov  is  variously  spelled  in  the  literature:  Pribiiloff 
(Martin  Sauer30  and  Georg  Heinrich  von  Langsdorff31);  Gehrman  Pribylov  (Henry 
Wood  Elliott32);  Gavrila  [Gabriel]  Pribylov  (Katerina  G.  Solovjova  and  Aleksandra  A. 
Vovnyanko33);  Gavriil  Pribylov  (Lydia  Black34);  Gerasim  Gavrilovich  Pribilof  (Scheffer 
et  al.35).  His  given  name,  as  noted,  received  a  variety  of  spellings.  Gerasim  (sometimes 
Gerassim)  commonly  appears  in  popular  writings.  The  name  Gerasim  assigned  to 
Pribylov  may  have  its  earliest  origin  with  Vasilii  N.  Berkh.36  In  1979,  Richard  A.  Pierce 
and  Alton  S.  Donnelly  emphatically  stated  that  Pribylov ’s  given  name  is  “not  Gerasim 
Loginovich”  but  rather  “Gavrilo  Loginovich,”37  a  name  applied  by  Kiril  Khlebnikov.38  In 
1990,  Pierce  contradicted  his  1979  interpretation  by  referring  to  Pribylov  as  “Gavriil”  in 
Russian  America:  A  Biographical  Dictionary ,39  Pribylov  was  also  referred  to  as  Gavriil  by 
Basil  Dmytryshyn,  E.  A.  P.  Crownhart- Vaughan,  and  Thomas  Vaughan,40  and  by  the  late 
Russian-American  historian,  Dr.  Lydia  T.  Black.  Gavriil  is  the  name  accepted  herein.41 

Although  the  current  spelling  for  the  islands,  “Pribilof,”  was  used  in  this  book, 
Gavriil’s  surname  remains  “Pribylov,”  unless  the  name  is  given  within  quotations  from 
outside  sources. 

Biographical  Sketch 

One  of  the  first  mentions  of  Gavriil  Pribylov  is  in  connection  with  the  Russian  fur- 
merchant  company  of  Lebedev-Lastochkin,  owned  by  Grigorii  Shelikhov  and  Pavel 
S.  Lebedev-Lastochkin.  The  two  owners  intended  to  monopolize  the  fur  trapping  and 
trading  business  in  eastern  Siberia  and  Russian  America,  and  initiate  fur-trade  relations 
with  Japan.  In  1780,  a  tsunami  that  followed  an  earthquake  “washed  Lebedev’s  vessel,  Sv. 
Natal’ia,  onto  Urup  Island  in  the  Kurile  Islands  where  existed  large  numbers  of  sea  otters. 
The  following  year,  F.  N.  Klichka,  the  Irkutsk  governor,  gave  Lebedev  the  government- 
owned  Sv.  Georgii  Pobedonosets  [St.  George  the  Victorious]  so  he  could  retrieve  the  vessel 
Sv.  Natal’ia ”42  The  man  instructed  to  return  the  damaged  vessel  was  Gavriil  Loginovich

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Pribylov,  described  as  a  former  Russian  navy  master  and  navigator  who  had  joined  the 
company  at  the  direction  of  his  navy  superiors.  While  in  command  of  the  SV.  Georgii, 
Pribylov  chose  to  sail  to  the  Aleutian  Islands  and  gather  valuable  furs  before  retrieving 
the  Sv.  Natal’ia.  (He  never  did  recover  the  damaged  Sv.  Natalia..)* 3 

After  his  discovery  of  the  Seal  Islands,  discussed  below,  Pribylov  served  as  pilot- 
navigator  on  the  vessel  Slava  Rossii  during  the  Billings-Sarychev  Expedition  in  1790. 
He  has  been  credited  with  mapping  Mednyi  (Copper)  Island.44  In  1794,  Pribylov  began 
working  for  the  Northeastern  Company  and  commanded  the  Sv.  Ekaterina  to  Kodiak 
Island,  Yakutat  Bay,  and  Sitka  Sound.  Later  in  1794,  he  commanded  the  Three  Saints  “to 
Yakutat  (Bering)  Bay,  and  in  1795  ...  he  attempted  to  deliver,  at  the  orders  of  Alexander 
Baranov  manager  of  the  Russian-American  Company,  the  first  party  of  Russian  settlers  at 
Yakutat,”45  but  he  apparently  died  before  completing  the  endeavor.46 

Russian  Discovery  of  the  Seal  Islands 

The  Seal  Islands  of  the  Bering  Sea,  also  romantically  referred  to  as  the  “Mist  Islands,” 
were  a  safe  haven  for  numerous  marine  mammal  and  bird  species  long  before  mankind’s 
relatively  recent  intervention,  approximately  220  years  ago.  One  wondrous  example  is 
the  recent  revelation  that  St.  Paul  Island  was  the  last  refuge  of  the  North  American  mam¬ 
moth.47  The  woolly  mammoth  species’  extended  period  of  survival  likely  resulted  from 
the  absence  of  man  during  the  pre-European  contact  period.48  The  shrinking  island  land- 
mass,  once  part  of  the  larger  “Beringia,”  and  consequent  reduction  in  forage  was  thought 
to  have  determined  the  species  fate. 

Neither  Gavriil  Pribylov  nor  the  men  serving  under  him  apparently  left  any  first¬ 
hand  written  accounts  of  their  discovery.  However,  sometime  following  his  return  from 
the  Seal  Islands,  but  not  sooner  than  late  1789,  Commander  Pribylov  conversed  with 
Admiral  Gavrilo  Sarychev  and  Martin  Sauer,  interpreter  for  Captain  Joseph  Billings  on 
the  “Northeastern  Secret  Geographical  and  Astronomical  Expedition.”49  Both  men  re¬ 
counted  Pribylov ’s  story.  Sauer’s  and  Sarychev’s  writings  appear  to  represent  the  earliest 
known  accounts  of  Pribylov ’s  Seal  Islands  discovery.  In  1802,  Sauer  wrote: 

At  the  time  he  [Pribylov]  took  charge  of  the  vessel  as  commander,  on  the  part  of  the  trading 
company;  for  which  he  received  a  share  in  the  profits  of  the  voyage.  He  made  Oonalashka 
[Unalaska],  and  from  his  former  observations  that  numbers  of  sea  animals,  particularly 
young  kotic  [fur  seals],  came  from  the  north  in  the  autumn,  at  the  commencement  of 
severe  weather,  he  had  formed  a  conjecture,  that  some  unknown  island  lay  at  no  great 
distance  in  that  direction;  and  therefore  resolved,  without  losing  time,  to  take  on  board  as 
many  islanders  as  he  could  obtain  with  their  small  canoes  and  arms,  and  be  convinced  of 
the  certainty  or  uncertainty  of  his  supposition. 

Twenty-four  hours  after  his  departure  from  the  island  of  Oonalashka,  he  discovered 
land.  The  southern  and  western  parts  are  surrounded  by  rocks;  but  the  north  is  easy  to 
approach,  and  affords  good  anchorage  in  a  commodious  bay  for  small  vessels,  not  drawing 
above  eight  or  nine  feet  of  water.  The  whole  island  is  volcanic,  destitute  of  inhabitants,  and 
only  produces  the  bulbs,  plants,  and  berries,  which  are  to  be  met  with  on  all  the  Aleutan 
[Aleutian]  islands.  They  found  the  low  lands  and  the  surrounding  rocks  covered  with  sea 
animals,  particularly  the  ursine  seal  (kotic),  and  sea-lion  (sivutsha);  and  with  the  skins  of 
these  animals  they  nearly  loaded  their  vessel.  Pribuloff  called  this  St.  George’s  Island;  and 
observing  another  island  to  the  north,  at  the  distance  of  44  miles,  he  went  thither  in  a  large

baidar,  accompanied  by  a  number  of  Aleutes.  This  island  is  much  smaller  than  that  of  St. 

George,  and  he  named  it  St.  Paul’s:  this,  as  well  as  the  former,  was  the  retreat  of  immense 
herds  of  seals.  On  the  island  of  St.  George  they  passed  the  winter,  and  found  the  island 
parts  overrun  with  foxes,  which  afforded  them  a  profitable  chase.  It  also  abounded  with  the 
tusks  of  the  walross,  whch  they  picked  up  on  the  shores.50 

In  1840,  Russian  Orthodox  Bishop  Ivan  Veniaminov  published  another  account  of 
the  Russian’s  discovery  of  the  Seal  Islands.  Sauer’s  account,  although  purportedly  taken 
from  Pribylov  himself,  differs  markedly  in  many  respects  from  later  accounts.  However, 
Veniaminov ’s  account  appears  to  be  given  the  most  widespread  credence  among  histo¬ 
rians.51 

The  first  Russian  fox  hunters  to  visit  the  Fox  Island  Chain  . . .  began,  because  of  the  annual 
migration  of  seals  in  the  spring  toward  the  north  and  in  the  fall  [toward]  the  south  with 
their  young,  to  suspect  the  existence  of  the  Pribylovs.  The  very  tradition  of  the  Aleuts 
probably  supported  their  conviction  that  islands  existed  to  the  north.  However  that  may 
be,  up  until  1781  no  one  undertook  the  search,  through  lack  of  ships  and  other  means, 
or  more  likely  because  at  that  time  sea  otters  were  still  plentiful  around  Unalashka  and  it 
was  needless  to  seek  a  new  source  of  wealth.  When  the  number  of  Russian  hunters  began 
to  increase  and  the  number  of  sea  otters  and  other  animals  to  diminish  rapidly,  some  of 
the  more  adventurous  hunters  determined  to  try  their  luck,  began  to  seek  the  Severnye 
[northern]  islands  where  the  fur  seals  were  breeding.  No  one  succeeded  in  this  until  1786. 

Navigator  Gavrilo  Pribylov,  who  had  spent  a  long  time  in  America,  was  convinced  by  the 
very  same  signs  that  islands  existed  in  the  Bering  Sea,  and  the  straitened  circumstances  in 
which  his  company  [Lebedev-Lastochkin]  found  itself  forced  him  to  make  the  effort  to  find 
them.  Despite  the  pre-eminence  of  Pribylov  in  skillful  seamanship  over  all  the  mariners  of 
the  time  in  that  region,  it  did  not  fall  to  him  to  quickly  discover  them.  While  near  one  of 
the  islands  that  later  were  to  bear  his  name,  he  kept  observing  unmistakable  signs  of  land. 

Yet,  for  a  period  of  three  weeks,  he  was  unable  to  see  land  because  of  fog. 

Finally,  fortune,  as  if  taking  pity  on  him,  or  perhaps  yielding  before  the  efforts  of  a 
persistent  man,  lifted  the  curtain  of  fog  and  the  eastern  part  of  the  island  nearest  the 
Aleutian  Archipelago  showed  itself,  to  their  indescribable  joy,  before  the  eyes  of  our 
mariners.  This  island  was  named  by  them  after  their  vessel  ostrov  Georgiia  [“George 
Island”].  The  foreman,  Efim  Ivanov  Popov,  with  all  the  fur  hunters  on  board,  remained  on 
the  newly  discovered  island,52  but  the  vessel,  for  want  of  a  harbor  there,  departed  to  winter 
at  the  Andreianov  Islands,  carrying  with  it  a  number  of  fur  seal  and  sea  otter  skins  that  they 
had  time  to  take. 

The  fur  hunters  who  remained  on  George  Island,  in  the  forenoon  of  June  29  of  the 
following  year  [1787]  (the  day  of  the  Apostles  Peter  and  Paul),  saw  to  the  north  an  island  to 
which  they  forthwith  gave  the  name  Peter  and  Paul  Island.  (At  present,  however,  the  name 
Peter  is  scarcely  ever  used.) 

These  islands,  from  the  time  of  their  discovery,  have  gone  under  a  multitude  of  names;  first 
of  all,  they  were  known  as  the  “New  Islands,”  then  Pribylov  and  the  leader  of  the  hunters 
called  them  the  Lebedevskie  [Lebedev]  Islands.  Mr.  Shelikhov  named  them  the  Zubovskie 
[ostrova]  [Zubov  Islands].53  The  fur  hunters  they  called  them  both  northern  [Severnye] 
because  of  their  position  to  the  north  of  Unalashka  and  the  Kotovye  ostrove  [Fur-Seal 
Islands]  because  of  the  pre-eminence  of  fur  seal  hunting  there.  At  the  present  time  [1840] 
they  are  known  in  the  colonies  simply  as  the  Ostrovki  [Islets]  but  the  designation  Pribylova, 
as  the  most  appropriate,  is  universally  used.54 

Physician  and  natural  historian  Georg  Heinrich  von  Langsdorff,  who  visited  the  is¬ 
lands  in  1805  while  on  a  Russian-American  Company  voyage  around  the  globe,  offered 


523 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


no  details  of  navigator  “Pribiiloff’s”  discovery  of  the  islands  except  that  Pribylov  had 
sailed  out  of  Unalaska.55 

Mentions  of  Pribylov’s  discovery  are  also  found  in  private  correspondence.  Fur  trader 
Grigorii  Ivanovich  Shelikov,  a  one-time  employer  of  Pribylov,  wrote  in  1789  to  his  chief 
manager  in  America,  Evstratii  Ivanovich  Delarov: 

Pribylov  has  found  two  small  islands  about  200  versts  from  Unalashka,  from  which  one  can 
see  more  islands.  Twenty  Russians  and  20  Aleuts  remained  to  hunt  on  these  islands  and 
the  rest  went  back  on  the  ship  to  better  harbors.  In  2  years  40  men  got  more  than  2,000 
sea  otters,  40,000  fur  seals,  6,000  blue  foxes,  and  1,000  puds  of  walrus  ivory.  Five  thousand 
puds  of  whalebone  was  left  on  the  islands  because  there  was  not  enough  room  on  the  ship 
to  load  it. 

Pribylov  brought  two  vessels  for  hunting,  the  first,  under  Lukaniev;  the  second,  under 
Potap.  They  will  start  in  the  year  1791.  The  chief  of  the  expedition,  Osip  Osipovich 
[Billings],  assured  me  that  he  will  help  you.  Besides  Pribylov’s  Islands  they  saw  millions 
of  sea  otters,  fur  seals  and  sea  lions  on  other  islands  to  the  north  and  on  the  coasts  of 
America.  I  regret  that  you  did  not  dispatch  a  ship  north,  as  I  instructed.56 

Pribylov  is  credited  as  the  first  Russian  sailor  to  recognize  the  islands  but  not  neces¬ 
sarily  the  first  non-Unangan  explorer  to  visit  them.  In  Zapiski  Ob  Ostrovah  Unalakinskago 
Otdeyla,  author  Ivan  Veniaminov  made  note  of  an  earlier  visitor: 

Traces  were  found  of  some  earlier  visitor,  not  long  before  Pribylov’s  time,  there  having 
been  described  on  the  southwest  shore  of  St.  Paul  Island,  the  copper  hilt  of  a  sword,  a  clay 
pipe,  and  a  spot  where  a  fire  had  been  kindled.  Had  that  visit  occurred  at  a  remote  date,  the 
sword  hilt  would  have  corroded  away  and  the  traces  of  the  fire  place  been  obliterated  by 
weeds.57 

If  the  above  account  is  correct,  then  who  was  or  were  those  earlier  discoverers? 
Russians,  Spaniards,  English?  And  did  their  vessel  sink  or  did  they  just  hold  onto  the 
secret  so  that  others  would  not  find  the  home  of  the  seals?58  Pribylov’s  discovery  of  the  is¬ 
lands  is  part  of  traditional  Aleut  and  Russian  folklore,  which  Veniaminov  described.  “But 
if  the  Aleut  tradition  is  to  be  believed,”  Veniaminov  wrote,  “handed  down  to  the  present 
in  their  tales,  they  had  known  of  the  Pribylofs  long  before  the  arrival  of  the  Russians.  They 
called  and  continue  to  call,  them  Amix59  [sic]  ascribing  their  discovery  to  Igadagax,  the  son 
of  an  Aleut  toion.”60  The  story  of  Igadagax  is  presented  in  his  biography  in  this  volume.

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Alexander  and  Lois  Proctor  arrived  at  St.  George 
Island  in  1912  and  remained  until  1916.  In  1919, 
the  Proctors  took  up  residence  on  St.  Paul  Island. 

Commander  W.  H.  O’Brien  Jr.  of  the  USS 
Saturn,  Alaska  Radio  Expedition  1916,  wrote  to 
his  commandant  at  Mare  Island,  California,  in 
appreciation  of  Mr.  Proctor: 

1.  Upon  the  arrival  of  the  Expedition  at  St.  George  Island,  the  Agent,  Mr.  H.  Proctor,  came 
aboard  and  offered  the  services  of  his  bidarrah  (a  native  skin  boat)  and  all  of  his  laborers 
which  number  twenty- five.  It  is  practically  impossible  to  land  freight  in  anything  but  a 
bidarrah. 

2.  After  the  freight  was  landed  and  work  commenced  on  the  station,  Mr.  Proctor  was 
very  considerate  and  helpful  in  loaning  tools  of  all  sorts,  lumber  for  staging,  and  even  to 
messing  the  workmen  for  two  meals  a  day.  Mr.  Proctor  has  done  everything  in  his  power  to 
co-operate  and  facilitate  the  work,  and  the  good  record  made  is  greatly  due  to  his  efforts.62

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


As  did  other  agents,  Proctor  dealt  with  a  variety  of  situations  on  the  islands.  One  was 
an  alleged  affair  between  a  young  Native  woman  and  a  navy  radioman,  who  was  thought 
to  be  the  father  of  the  woman’s  baby.63  The  radioman  vehemently  denied  the  allegations, 
which  were  never  verified.  However,  the  incident  strained  relations  between  Proctor  and 
the  radioman,  who  left  St.  Paul  on  the  navy  vessel  USS  Saturn  about  the  time  of  the  child’s 
birth.  The  radioman  was  replaced  by  Harry  A.  Peterson,  an  electrician  first  class  with  the 
USN  Radio  Service.  Peterson  and  his  wife  took  up  quarters  in  the  radio  cottage.64

19  In  the  view  of  these  authors,  Phelps’  argument  that  the  Seal  Islands  were  “one  of  the  principal 
inducements  upon  which  the  purchase  was  made”  was  not  supported  in  the  records  we  examined, 
although  the  Seal  Islands  were  alluded  to  in  Senator  Charles  Sumner’s  speech  (see  Sumner’s  biogra¬ 
phy).  Our  opinion  does  not  mean,  however,  that  the  topic  of  the  economic  value  of  the  Seal  Islands 
wasn’t  raised  during  official  or  unofficial  conversations,  and  we  have  seen  writings  indicating  that 
California  and  Washington  Territory  businesses  or  “business  interests”  did  consider  the  Seal  Islands 
reason  enough  (e.g.,  see  Hayward  Hutchinson’s  biography).

52  Dmytryshyn  and  Crownhart- Vaughan,  eds.,  The  End  of  Russian  America,  vol.  2,  373-4,  cited  a  letter 
written  by  Grigorii  I.  Shelikhov  to  Evstrat  I.  Delarov  in  which  he  stated,  “When  Pribylov  was  about 
halfway  to  Aglits,  he  discovered  two  small  islands  not  more  than  200  versts  [one  verst  =  0.6629  mile 
or  1.067  kilometers]  from  Unalaska.  From  those  two  islands,  still  others  are  visible.  On  the  two  he 
discovered  he  left  20  Russians  and  20  Aleuts  to  hunt,  and  the  rest  went  back  by  ship  to  good  har¬ 
bors.  In  two  years  the  40  men  took  more  than  2,000  sea  otters,  40,000  fur  seals,  6,000  blue  fox,  1,000 
puds  [one  pud  =  36.11  pounds  avoirdupois]  of  walrus  tusks,  and  500  puds  of  whiskers. . . .  Pribylov’s

other.”

his  rich  cargo.”  This  statement  is  taken  to  mean  that  no  record  was  found  of  any  vessel  being  at  the

context.  Bancroft,  A  History  of  Alaska,  191-2,  applied  the  name  “Amik.”

Redpath,  James  C.  (1844-1920) 

Agent,  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  1875-1890 

Agent,  North  American  Commercial  Company,  1890-1905 

Superintendent,  North  American  Commercial  Company,  1906-1910 

Genealogy 

James  C.  Redpath  was  born  to  English  emigres  in  Connecticut  in  1844  and  died  in  San 
Francisco  on  August  13,  1920.  He  never  married.  When  not  in  Alaska,  Redpath  lived  in 
San  Francisco  as  a  fur-trader  managing  a  fur  store.1 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

James  Redpath  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  June  3,  1892,  before  Treasury 
Agent-in-Charge  William  H.  Williams  at  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska.  Excerpts  follow: 

1  am  an  American  citizen,  a  native  of  Connecticut,  and  I  am  forty-eight  years  of  age.  At 
present  I  am  a  resident  of  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska.  I  have  resided  on  the  Seal  Islands  of  St. 

George  and  St.  Paul  since  my  first  coming  to  Alaska  in  1875.  My  present  occupation  is  that 
of  local  agent  on  St.  Paul  Island  for  the  present  lessees,  the  North  American  Commercial 
Company.  I  have  a  practical  knowledge  of  and  am  thoroughly  conversant  with  the  habits 
and  conditions  of  the  fur  seal  as  it  exists  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  of  St.  George  and  St. 

Paul. ...  I  have  had  a  personal  experience  of  seventeen  seasons  on  the  killing  grounds  in 
different  situations,  from  that  of  seal  clubber  to  foreman,  several  years  of  which  I  have  been 
the  resident  local  agent. 

Before  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  leased  the  seal  islands  in  1870,  it  was  a  common 
practice  to  drive  seals  from  North  East  Point  to  the  Village  on  St.  Paul  Island,  a  distance 
of  12  miles  and  from  Zapadnie  to  the  Village  on  St.  George  Island,  a  distance  of  6  miles, 
across  a  very  rough  and  rugged  country. 

When  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  took  control  of  the  islands  the  drive  from  North 
East  point  was  prohibited,  and  a  salt  house  and  other  necessary  buildings  erected  within 

2  miles  of  the  killing  ground,  and  all  the  skins  taken  there  were  salted,  stored,  and  shipped 


529 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


from  North  East  Point.  In  1879  a  killing  ground  was  made,  and  a  salt  house  built  at  Halfway 
Point,  within  2  miles  of  the  hauling  grounds,  and  all  skins  taken  at  the  Point  are  salted 
there.  At  Zapadnie,  the  same  year,  a  killing  ground  was  made  within  a  mile  of  the  hauling 
ground,  and  the  skins  taken  there  are  taken  to  the  Village  salt  house  in  boats,  or,  when  the 
weather  is  unfavorable,  by  team  and  wagon. 

Since  1878  there  has  not  been  a  drive  made  on  St.  George,  a  salt  house  was  built  about 
1875,  and  the  6  mile  drive  prohibited,  and  a  trail  made  at  great  expense  across  the  Island, 
over  which  the  skins  are  taken  on  pack  saddles  to  the  Village.  Since  1874  no  seals  have  been 
driven  on  St.  George  Island  to  exceed  2  Vi  miles.2 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

During  the  course  of  writing  an  article  titled  “Polar  Bear  and  Mammoth,”  Smithsonian  pa¬ 
leontologist  Clayton  Edward  Ray  interviewed  former  government  agent  G  Dallas  Hanna, 
who  had  known  James  Redpath: 

At  the  time  of  the  Jordan  Investigation  of  the  Fur  Seals  of  the  Pribilof  Islands,  these  islands 
were  under  lease  to  the  North  American  Commercial  Company.  The  local  manager  was 
Mr.  Redpath.  After  the  termination  of  the  lease,  he  settled  at  Dutch  Harbor,  Alaska.  I  met 
him  there  once,  but  I  do  recall  having  discussed  the  various  practical  jokes  which  were 
attributed  to  him  by  his  own  company  associates,  [Alexander  Henry]  Proctor  and  [Watson 
Colt]  Allis.  Mr.  Redpath  was  a  very  pleasant  conversationalist.  One  of  these  pranks  was 
the  sowing  of  Lukanin  black  sand  beach  with  brass  spelter  just  after  the  last  ship  had 
sailed  south  one  fall.  The  news  of  having  discovered  gold  on  the  black  sands  of  Alaska 
the  previous  summer  led  to  casual  observation  at  the  mess  table  that  some  of  the  sands 
on  St.  Paul  were  black.  Might  they  also  carry  gold?  Lukanin  beach,  being  very  handy,  was 
investigated  and  much  to  the  surprise  of  every  one,  the  first  test  revealed  specks  of  yellow 
metal.  The  resulting  “gold”  rush  was  on  and  lasted  until  cold  weather  closed  the  operation. 

Before  spring,  someone  figured  out  how  to  test  for  gold  and  the  fun  was  over.

The  mammoth  teeth  found  in  the  cave  in  Bogoslof  Hill  were  apparently  planted  under  Mr. 
Redpath’s  direction.  They  had  probably  been  obtained  from  people  returning  from  Seward 
Peninsula,  where  they  were  obtained  in  numbers  during  gold-rush  days.  South-bound 
vessels  from  Nome  often  put  in  to  Village  Cove  on  St.  Paul,  so  the  opportunity  was  there. 
Apparently  Mr.  Redpath  was  entertaining  members  of  the  Jordan  Expedition  and  turned 
the  conversation  to  fossil  mammoths  and  suggested  that  the  cave  in  Bogoslof  Hill  would  be 
an  excellent  place  to  search.  Members  of  the  expedition  then  went  to  the  cave  and  rather 
quickly  found  what  they  were  looking  for. 

I  believe  one  of  the  natives  who  first  told  me  the  story  of  Bogoslof  Cave  was  Neon  Tetof,  in 
whom  I  grew  to  place  much  confidence.  It  was  repeated  by  others,  including  the  two  (then 
boys)  who  did  the  actual  planting.  I  recall  they  chose  a  dark,  rainy  day  for  the  three  or  four 
mile  trip,  so  as  not  to  be  seen  by  any  of  the  investigators  of  the  expedition.3 

Local  lore  on  the  Pribilofs  tells  of  Redpath’s  support  of  at  least  one  and  maybe  more 
children  born  out  of  wedlock,  to  whom  he  left  large  sums  of  money  upon  his  death  in  San 
Francisco.4

Resanzoff  (Rezanzoff),  Peter  (1844-1899) 

Genealogy 

Peter  Resanzoff  was  born  on  St.  George  Island,  Alaska,  on  March  6,  1844. 11  Peter  married 
Matrona  (surname  unknown)  born  in  1838,  Sitka,  Alaska.  Peter  and  Matrona  had  a  son, 
Paul,  born  July  9,  1877,  and  a  daughter,  Tatiana,  born  February  22,  1883,  on  St.  George 
Island.12  Peter  Rezanoff  died  there  on  January  27,  1899. 13 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

The  following  description  of  Peter  Resanzoff  is  taken  from  testimony  given  by  George 
Wardman  before  the  Committee  on  Merchant  Marine  and  Fisheries  in  1888.  Wardman, 
a  former  Treasury  agent,  was  asked  if  he  had  knowledge  “of  the  condition  of  the  natives 
on  the  [St.  George]  island  compared  with  what  it  was  before  the  Territory  was  ceded  to 
the  United  States.” 

Yes,  sir;  we  had  there  a  very  intelligent  half-breed  native.  He  spoke  very  good  English,  and 
he  could  read  and  write  English  very  well.  His  name  was  Peter  Resanzoff.  He  had  been 
educated  at  Sitka  under  the  Russian  rule,  when  he  was  a  boy.  I  think  his  father  was  going  to 
put  him  in  the  church,  but  he  never  went  in.  He  seemed  to  be  a  pretty  bright  fellow  and  he 
was  better  educated  than  any  of  the  children  who  had  been  to  school  on  the  island.  He  used 
to  read  Dickens’s  [sic]  stories.  He  can  make  a  pair  of  pump-soled  boots;  he  is  a  first-class 
carpenter,  and  can  make  a  gun-tube  out  of  a  rat-tail  file;  he  is  a  pretty  good  blacksmith, 
and  could  cut  your  hair  as  well  as  a  barber,  and  he  was  a  pretty  clever  fellow.  He  said  that 
those  fellows  did  like  to  work,  but  under  the  Russian  rule  they  had  to  pack  every  skin  from 
the  village  over  to  Garden  Cove,  which  is  3  miles  across  the  island.  They  had  a  landing  on 
the  south  side  of  the  island  and  they  used  to  make  the  natives  pack  all  the  skins  over  there. 

They  lived  in  barabakies  at  that  time.  A  barabakie  is  a  sort  of  dirt  house.  They  lived  at 
“Staroi  Steel,”  or  old  village,  and  the  Russians  made  them  pack  skins  from  there  clear  across 
the  island,  3  miles,  to  a  vessel  on  the  other  side.  The  Americans  have  put  in  better  facilities 
for  shipping  skins.  Peter  said  the  natives  all  lived  in  barabkies  at  that  time,  and  now  they 
live  in  frame  houses.14 

Peter  Resanzoff’s  name  also  appeared  in  testimony  given  by  former  Assistant  Agent 
William  Gavitt  before  the  Committee  on  Merchant  Marine  and  Fisheries  in  1888.  Gavitt 
had  alleged  that  Alaska  Commercial  Company  (ACC)  employees  abused  St.  George  Island 
Natives,  and  for  his  attempt  to  quell  the  abuse  these  same  individuals  verbally  abused  and 
threatened  him  and  his  wife.  Peter  Resanzoff  along  with  other  unnamed  Natives  signed  a 
petition  sustaining  Gavitt ’s  allegations.  Gavitt  stated  that  an  ACC  employee  threatened  to 
“get  even  with  Peter  Rezanzoff,”  and  subsequently,  he  alleged,  ACC  personnel  forced  Mr. 
Resanzoff  to  a  work  detail  when  he  was  ill  so  that  he  could  not  testify  on  Gavitt’s  behalf.15 
William  Gavitt’s  allegations  were  ultimately  dismissed  by  the  committee,  as  discussed  in 
more  detail  in  his  biography  herein.

Roosevelt,  Theodore  (1858-1919) 

President  of  the  United  States,  1901-1909 
Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

President  Theodore  Roosevelt  had  concerns  that  the  rapid  decline  of  the  northern  fur- 
seal  population  was  fueled  by  Japanese  pelagic  sealers  harassing  the  Pribilof  Islands,  as 
well  as  the  fact  that  their  escapades  wreaked  havoc  with  U.S.  foreign  affairs.  (See  the 
Walter  Lembkey  biographical  sketch,  which  addresses  the  killing  of  several  Japanese  ma¬ 
rauders  on  St.  Paul  Island  in  1906.)  Roosevelt  addressed  the  issue  in  a  magazine  article 
wherein  he  considered  exterminating  the  fur-seal  herd: 

In  case  we  are  obliged  to  abandon  the  hope  of  making  arrangements  with  other 
governments  to  put  an  end  to  the  hideous  cruelty  now  incident  of  pelagic  sealing,  it  will  be 
a  question  for  your  serious  consideration  how  far  we  shall  continue  to  protect  and  maintain 
the  seal  herd  on  land  with  result  of  continuing  such  a  practice,  and  whether  it  is  not  better 
to  end  the  practice  by  exterminating  the  herd  ourselves  in  the  most  humane  way  possible.16 

President  Roosevelt  did  not  have  to  give  the  order  to  exterminate  the  herd.

I  am  further  satisfied  after  my  two  years’  experience  that  the  driving  of  male  seals  to  the

Zoologist,  Author,  Photographer,  Lecturer,  and  Conservationist 
Biologist,  Pribilof  Islands,  1940-1964 
Chairman,  Marine  Mammal  Commission,  1973 

Genealogy 

Victor  Blanchard  Scheffer  was  born  on 
November  27,  1906,  in  Manhattan,  Kansas,  to 
biologist  Theophilus  Scheffer  (1867-1967)  and 
Celia  Esther  (Blanchard)  Scheffer.  His  father 
“worked  for  the  old  Bureau  of  Biological  Survey, 
the  first  federal  agency  concerned  with  explor¬ 
ing  the  bird  and  mammal  fauna  in  the  United 
States.”1  Victor  Scheffer  married  Mary  Elizabeth 
Maclnnes  on  October  12, 1935.  The  Scheffers  had 
three  children:  Brian  M.  Scheffer,  a  psychothera¬ 
pist;  Susan  (Scheffer)  Irvine,  a  homemaker;  and 
Anne  (Scheffer)  Carlstrom,  a  middle-school  math 
teacher.2 

Biographical  Sketch 

Victor  Scheffer’s  early  education  took  place  in  the 
Puyallup,  Washington,  schools.  He  earned  degrees  in  zoology — BS  (1930),  MS  (1932), 
and  PhD  (1936) — from  the  University  of  Washington.  His  first  job  in  zoology  was  with 
the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Entomology,  slicing  daffodil  bulbs  in  search  of  bulb-fly  grubs,  during 
the  summer  of  1928.  He  also  worked  as  a  nature  guide  at  Mount  Rainer  National  Park  for

five  summers  while  attending  the  University  of  Washington,  thus  obtaining  a  first-hand 
ecological  education.  5 

In  1937,  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  U.S.  Biological  Survey,  hired  Scheffer  as  a 
junior  biologist;  he  spent  his  summers  in  that  position  with  the  Olaus  Murie  Aleutian 
Islands  Expedition.  In  1940,  just  before  the  Biological  Survey  became  the  new  U.S.  Fish 
and  Wildlife  Service  within  the  Department  of  the  Interior,  Scheffer  was  assigned  to  the 
Pribilof  Islands,  an  experience  that  led  him  to  become  a  “world  authority  on  the  biol¬ 
ogy  and  conservation  of  marine  mammals.”4  Scheffer  retired  from  government  service  in 
1969  to  devote  more  time  to  writing  and  lecturing.  Among  his  numerous  publications  in 
the  following  years  were  six  award-winning  titles:  The  Year  of  the  Whale  (1969,  winner  of 
the  John  Burroughs  Medal  in  1970),  The  Year  of  the  Seal  (1970),  The  Little  Calf  (1970),  The 
Seeing  Eye  (1971),  A  Voice  for  Wildlife  (1974,  recipient  of  the  Joseph  Wood  Krutch  Award 
in  1975),  and  A  Natural  History  of  Marine  Mammals  (1976).  In  1973,  Scheffer  became  the 
first  chairman  of  the  Marine  Mammal  Commission,  created  after  passage  of  the  federal 
Marine  Mammal  Protection  Act  of  1972.5  In  2006,  Victor  B.  Scheffer  became  a  centenar¬ 
ian;  his  father  also  had  lived  into  his  100th  year. 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Victor  Scheffer’s  life-altering  adventure  into  the  world  of  the  fur  seal  began  when  he  left 
Seattle  for  the  Pribilof  Islands  on  June  10,  1940,  aboard  the  Bureau  of  Fisheries  vessel 
Penguin.  During  his  first  summer  in  the  field,  Scheffer’s  job  focused  on  conducting  a 
census  of  the  fur-seal  population,  which  he  later  estimated  at  one  and  a  half  million. 
Lacking  other  professional  assistance,  Scheffer  used  a  method  of  hot-iron  branding  on 
5,000  seal  pups  with  intentions  of  developing  a  scientific  approach  for  estimating  the 
population  in  subsequent  years;  he  later  said  that  “the  hot-iron  branding  of  pups  was 
an  unintended  cruelty  because  the  little  seal  pups  didn’t  like  it  at  all.”6  Over  the  next  few 
years  Scheffer  substituted  the  method  of  applying  metal  tags  to  the  seals’  bodies,  along 
with  aerial  photography  and  a  continuation  of  the  pole  counting  method  (“lines  of  white 
or  striped  poles  . . .  along  the  ground  midway  between  tri-pod  towers,  marking  the  limits 
of  the  area  counted  from  each  tower”).7  Scheffer’s  1948  aerial  photos  of  the  islands  are 
among  the  earliest  aerial  photos  taken  of  the  Pribilof  Islands.  Earlier  aerial  photos  were 
taken  by  military  personnel  during  WWII.  Aerial  photography  proved  to  be  a  dramatic 
improvement  for  counting  seals  over  any  other  methods  previously  used  by  other  scien¬ 
tists  and  non-scientists. 

Besides  the  seal  population,  Scheffer  studied  Arctic  blue  fox,  reindeer,  numerous 
birds,  and  plants  of  all  varieties  on  the  Pribilof  Islands.  In  the  summer  of  1940,  he  esti¬ 
mated  the  reindeer  herd  on  St.  Paul  Island  at  2,000  animals.  Little  more  than  a  decade 
later,  in  1951,  he  wrote  of  the  demise  of  the  herds  on  the  Seal  Islands  and  pointed  to  the 
reasons.8  During  his  fifteen  summer  trips  to  the  Pribilof  Islands  over  twenty-four  years 
(1940-64), 9  Scheffer  accumulated  an  extensive  collection  of  photographs  accompanied 
by  a  detailed,  annotated  catalog  of  those  images.  He  wrote  extensively  on  the  subject  of 
fur  seals  and  on  other  subjects  as  well.  From  1932  to  2001,  he  produced  284  scientific 
publications,  including  29  books.10  Using  his  large  collection  of  scientific  materials  and

chived,  although  they  remain  uncataloged  and  un-indexed  at  the  time  of  this  writing. 

Beginning  in  1955,  Scheffer’s  findings  “figured  prominently  during  the  negotiations 
.  .  .  for  a  new  fur-seal  treaty.  Those  talks  culminated  in  the  ratification,  in  1957,  of  the 
Convention  on  Conservation  of  North  Pacific  Fur  Seals,  agreed  to  by  the  four  signatories 
to  the  1911  treaty.”11

Biographical  Sketch 

[Benjamin  Franklin  Scribner]  early  displayed  a  military 
bent,  joining  the  Spencer  Grays,  a  local  militia  group.  When 
war  broke  out  with  Mexico  in  1846,  the  group  volunteered 
for  action,  and  became  Company  A  of  the  2nd  Indiana 
Volunteers.  Scribner  served  for  one  year,  seeing  action 
at  Buena  Vista  and  earning  a  promotion  to  sergeant.  In 
1847  he  published  an  account  of  his  experiences,  largely 
excerpts  from  his  journals,  entitled  Camp  Life  of  a  Volunteer 
(Evansville,  J.  R.  Nunemacher,  1847). 


Scribner’s  civilian  occupation  was  as  a  chemist  and  druggist, 
and  in  the  profession  he  ran  the  partnership  of  Scribner 
and  Magazines,  one  of  the  largest  [stores]  of  its  kind  in  New 
Albany. 

In  1861,  Scribner  first  joined  a  local  militia,  then  as  a  colonel 
he  [was]  recruited  [by]  the  38th  Indiana  Volunteers.  This 
regiment  in  the  following  two  years  served  in  Kentucky  and 
Tennessee,  and  saw  action  at  Stones  River,  Chickamauga, 
Lookout  Mountain,  and  Kenesaw  [sic]  Mountain. ...  He  was

Scribner  took  advantage  of  his  war  service  to  obtain  appointment  in  1865  as  collector 
of  internal  revenue  for  the  second  Indiana  district.  He  held  this  post  for  six  years,  while 
retaining  an  interest  in  the  drug  business  which  was  run  by  his  partner.14 

After  Scribner  returned  to  Indiana  in  1880,  he  pursued  his  pharmacy  interests  and 
remained  involved  with  veterans’  affairs.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Biographical  Sketch 

William  Seward  practiced  law  in  Auburn,  New 
York,  beginning  in  1823.  He  served  as  governor 
of  New  York  from  1839  to  1843  and  was  elected 
to  the  U.S.  Senate,  where  he  served  from  1849  to 
1861  and  was  a  strong  advocate  for  anti-slavery 
legislation.  He  served  as  U.S.  Secretary  of  State 
from  1861  to  1869,  during  which  time  he  initi¬ 
ated  and  concluded  negotiations  with  Russia  to 
acquire  Russian  America,  soon  to  be  known  as 
the  Territory  of  Alaska.17  The  story  of  Seward’s 
involvement  with  the  purchase  of  Alaska  has 
been  written  about  extensively.  Interested  read¬ 
ers  are  urged  to  examine  sources  such  as  Victor 
J.  Farrar,  The  Annexation  of  Russian  America  to  the  United  States;  Ted  C.  Hinckley,  The 
Americanization  of  Alaska,  1867-1897;  Ronald  Jensen,  The  Alaska  Purchase  and  Russian- 
American  Relations;  David  Hunter  Miller,  The  Alaska  Treaty,  Morgan  B.  Sherwood, 
Alaska  and  Its  History;  and  Archie  W.  Shiels,  The  Purchase  of  Alaska. 

We  did  not  find  any  records  specifically  linking  Secretary  Seward  to  the  Pribilof 
Islands  or  the  northern  fur  seal.  It  remains  unclear  whether  the  Seal  Islands  was  part  of 
his  rationale  for  purchase  of  Russian  America,  but  clearly  his  actions  led  to  significant 
changes  for  the  inhabitants  of  the  Seal  Islands.

Shaiashnikov  (Shaiashnikoff),  Kass’ian  (d.  1859) 

Manager,  Russian-American  Company,  St.  Paul  Island  (ca.  1828-1857) 

Genealogy 

Kass’ian  Shaiashnikov18  married  Nadezhda  (unknown  surname)  on  July  8,  1827.  The 
couple  had  six  children:  Innokenty  (b.  1827);  Pavel  (b.  1835);  Kseniia  (b.  1838);  Petr  (b. 
1839,  d.  1848);  Zakharii  (b.  1841);  and  Mariia  (died  1848).  Biographer  Richard  Pierce 
surmised  that  first  wife  Nadezhda  died  before  Kass’ian’s  marriage  to  Iustiniia  Kochergin 
on  August  4,  1850.19  Kass’ian  and  Iustiniia  had  four  children:  Mariia  (1850-52),  Kassian 
(b.  1852),  Evdokiia  (b.  1854),  and  Petr  (b.  1855).  Kass’ian  died  at  Unalaska  on  January  2, 
1859.  Iustiniia  died  March  6,  1863.20 

Pribilof  Experience 

Deacon  Kass’ian  Shaiashnikoff  served  as  the  Russian-American  Company  manager  of  St. 
Paul  Island  from  circa  1828  until  he  retired  in  1857.21  Aleut  historian  Henry  W.  Elliott 
wrote  about  Deacon  Kass’ian’s  diary,  which  unfortunately  did  not  survive  to  tell  what 
likely  would  have  been  an  illuminating  perspective  of  life  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  during 
the  mid-nineteenth  century.

He  left  a  copious  and  a  carefully  written  diary,  covering  everything  that  transpired  daily  on 
the  seal  islands  [sic]  during  all  that  period.  A  stupid  and  unworthy  relative  actually  took  this 
precious  MS.  [manuscript]  and  had  pasted  it  all  over  the  doors,  the  walls,  and  the  ceiling 
of  his  house  on  the  island  in  1860-1864,  and  I  saw  a  few  of  the  smoke-stained  sheets  still 
sticking  there  in  1872.22 

Apparently,  Kass’ian  was  highly  regarded  by  his  superiors.  Among  other  accom¬ 
plishments,  he  was  credited  with  providing  a  detailed  natural  history  of  the  northern  fur 
seal  included  in  a  book  by  Iurii  Simashko,  titled  Description  of  All  Water  Animals  of  the 
Russian  Empire  (1851). Two  of  Kass’ian’s  sons,  Innokenty  and  Pavel  (Paul),  became  the 
first  Orthodox  priests  to  serve  St.  Paul  Island  (see  the  chapter  herein  on  the  Orthodox 
clergy  on  the  islands).

Chief  of  Division,  Revenue  Marine 


Genealogy 

Leonard  Griffin  Shepard  was  born  November  10, 
1846,  at  Dorchester,  Massachusetts,  to  Horatio 
Gates  Shepard  and  Mary  A.  (Griffin)  Shepard. 
Leonard  married  Isabel  Sharp  on  February  4, 1880, 
in  Steubenville,  Ohio,  and  the  couple  had  two  chil¬ 
dren,  Leonard  Griffin  and  William  Chambers.24 
Captain  Shepard  died  of  pneumonia  at  age  forty- 
nine  on  March  1,  1895,  in  Washington,  D.C.25 

Biographical  Sketch 

Captain  Leonard  Shepard  was  the  “first  officer  in 
permanent  charge  of  the  Revenue  Marine,”26  later 
known  as  the  Revenue  Cutter  Service,  where  he 
dealt  with  issues  of  personnel  and  fleet  improve¬ 
ments.

Isabel  Shepard  accompanied  her  husband  on 
his  1889  cruise  to  the  Bering  Sea  in  protection  of  the  fur  seal.  That  year  the  Bancroft 
Company  in  San  Francisco  printed  her  book,  The  Cruise  of  the  U.S.  Steamer  Rush  in 
Behring  Sea— Summer  of 1889,  which  recorded  her  experiences  during  the  voyage.27 


Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Captain  Shepard  offered  his  experience  of  patrolling  the  Bering  Sea  to  the  Tribunal  of 
Arbitration  on  April  27,  1892,  before  Notary  Public  George  Y.  Coffin  at  Washington, 
D.C.  His  deposition  may  have  influenced  the  tribunal  to  prohibit  pelagic  sealing  within

U.S.  Revenue  Steamer  Rush.  (Isabel  Shepard,  The  Cruise  of  the  U.S.  Steamer  Rush  in  Behring  Sea — 
Summer  of  1889J 


sixty  miles  of  the  Seal  Islands.  Unfortunately,  the  sixty-mile  radius  proved  insufficient  as 
female  seals  traveled  150  miles  or  more  from  the  islands  to  feed.  Shepard  recalled  three 
cruises  to  the  Bering  Sea,  in  1887,  1888,  and  1889, 

for  the  purpose  of  enforcing  existing  law  for  protection  of  seal  life  in  Alaska  and  the  waters 
thereof,  and  also  to  protect  other  Government  interests  in  Alaska. 

Pursuant  to  orders  received  from  the  Treasury  Department,  I  sailed  from  San  Francisco 
June  4,  1887,  arriving  at  Unalaska  on  the  15th  of  that  month.  On  the  18th  I  commenced 
cruising  in  Bering  Sea.  I  hereby  append  to  and  make  a  part  of  this  affidavit  a  table,  marked 
A,  giving  the  names  of  the  vessels  seized  by  me  in  Bering  Sea  while  violating  the  law  of  the 
United  States  in  relation  to  the  taking  of  fur-bearing  animals  (all  these  vessels  so  seized 
were  unmistakably  engaged  in  sealing),  together  with  the  date  of  the  seizure  in  each  case, 
the  nationality,  rig,  tonnage,  hailing  port,  master,  and  managing  owner  of  each  vessel, 
the  longitude  and  latitude  in  which  each  vessel  was  seized,  the  white  men,  Indians,  and 
Chinamen  on  board  at  the  time  of  seizure,  the  number  of  sealskins  and  the  weapons  on 
each  vessel.  In  the  cases  of  the  Challenge,  Anna  Beck,  W.P  Sayward,  Dolphin,  Lilly  L., 

Grace,  and  San  Jose  the  vessels  were  towed  to  Unalaska,  and  their  sealskins  and  arms  were 
taken  from  them,  and  they  were  sent  to  Sitka.  The  Ellen,  Albert  Adams,  Annie,  Alpha, 
and  the  Kate  and  Anna  were  disarmed  and  the  sealskins  taken  on  board  the  Rush  at  the 
time  and  place  of  seizure,  and  they  too  were  sent  to  Sitka.  All  these  vessels  reported  there, 
except  the  Ellen  and  San  Jose,  going  to  San  Francisco,  and  the  Albert  Adams,  to  Victoria, 

British  Columbia.

I  again  sailed  from  San  Francisco,  the  3rd  of  July,  1888,  and  entered  Bering  Sea  about  the 
16th  of  the  same  month.  Owing  to  the  large  number  of  vessels  seized  in  1887,  very  few 
entered  Bering  to  take  seals  in  1888,  and  I  made  no  seizures.  I  only  saw  two  vessels  in 
the  sea  during  that  season,  one  of  which,  the  Juanita  of  Victoria,  British  Columbia,  was 
engaged  in  taking  seal  at  the  time  we  sighted  her,  which  was  August  5,  in  latitude  54°  38" 
north,  longitude  166°  54"  west. 

In  1889  I  again  sailed  from  San  Francisco  for  Bering  Sea  on  June  1,  and  arrived  at  Unalaska 
June  16. 1  began  cruising  in  the  sea  eight  days  later.  1  hereby  append  to  and  make  a  part  of 
this  affidavit  a  table  marked  B,  giving  the  names  of  the  vessels  seized  by  me  in  Bering  Sea 
while  violating  the  laws  of  the  United  States  in  relation  to  the  taking  of  fur-bearing  animals, 
together  with  the  date  of  seizure,  nationality,  rig,  tonnage,  hailing  port,  master,  managing 
owner,  latitude  and  longitude  in  which  seized,  and  the  white  men  and  Indians  on  board  at 
the  time  of  seizure,  the  number  of  sealskins  and  weapons  on  each  vessel  seized.  In  nearly 
every  case  of  those  vessels  named  in  Table  B,  they  had  boats  out  engaged  in  sealing.  All 
of  them  were  ordered  to  go  to  Sitka,  but  none  of  them  reported  there,  all  going  to  their 
homeports.  The  Black  Diamond,  the  Minnie,  and  the  Pathfinder  were  each  placed  in 
charge  of  a  special  United  States  officer,  who  protested  in  vain  against  the  noncompliance 
with  the  instructions  given  to  proceed  to  Sitka.  The  Minnie  in  spite  of  the  officer  on  board 
continued  sailing  in  Bering  Sea  until  August  17,  and  secured  during  that  time  478  seal 
skins.

I  hereby  append  to  and  make  part  of  this  affidavit  [Table  C]  the  number  and  names  of 
vessels  fitted  out  for  sealing  boarded  and  examined  by  me  in  Bering  Sea  or  the  waters  of 
Alaska  Territory  during  the  sealing  season  of  1889,  together  with  the  date  of  master,  owner, 
latitude  and  longitude,  white  men  and  Indians  on  board,  sealskins  and  weapons  found. 

The  last  three  columns  of  said  table  are  incomplete,  from  the  fact  that  the  officers  boarding 
failed  to  get  definite  statements  on  these  points.  They  were  not  seized,  because  evidence 
was  wanting  as  to  their  having  actually  sealed  in  Bering  Sea.  During  these  three  years  I  had 
frequent  conversations  with  the  masters  and  crews  of  sealing  vessels  in  relation  to  open-

sea  sealing.  From  these  conversations,  and  also  from  my  own  observations,  I  make  the 
following  statement  in  relation  to  pelagic  sealing. . . . 

It  is  my  opinion  that  should  pelagic  sealing  be  prohibited  in  a  zone  30,  40,  or  50  miles  about 
the  Pribilof  Islands  it  would  be  utterly  useless  as  a  protection  to  seal  life,  because  female 
seals  go  much  farther  than  that  in  search  of  food,  and  because  fogs  are  so  prevalent  about 
those  islands  that  it  would  be  impossible  to  enforce  any  such  prohibition.28

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

In  July  1906,  Edwin  Sims,  Solicitor  for  the 
Department  of  Commerce  and  Labor,  traveled  to 
the  Pribilof  Islands  to  undertake  a  special  inves¬ 
tigation.  Agent  Walter  Lembkey  was  in  charge  at 
the  time.  Coincidentally,  Sims  arrived  a  few  days 
after  a  raid  by  Japanese  sealers  had  resulted  in 
the  deaths  of  several  and  the  capture  of  others. 
In  recording  the  incident  Sims  praised  Agent 
Lembkey  and  the  island’s  Aleut  guard.  The  report 
attested  to  the  stressful  conditions  facing  inhabit¬ 
ants  of  the  islands  during  the  pelagic  sealing  era, 
as  detailed  within  the  following  excerpts. 


About  9  o’clock  on  the  morning  of  July  16  the 
native  watchmen  at  Northeast  Point,  St.  Paul 
Island,  reported  a  schooner,  about  two  miles  out, 
sailing  toward  the  shore.  Upon  the  receipt  of 
this  information  Chief  Agent  W.I.  Lembkey  and 
Assistant  Agent  James  Judge,  each  accompanied 
by  three  or  four  natives,  proceeded  to  a  point  on 
the  shore  from  which  the  schooner  could  be  seen. 
These  agents  and  their  parties  then  separated  and 
concealed  themselves  at  a  point  where  landings 
were  feasible  close  to  two  of  the  principal  breeding

areas,  and  about  a  half  a  mile  from  each  other.  The  schooner,  which  was  easily  seen  by  these 
parties,  continued  to  cruise  parallel  with  the  shore  at  a  distance  of  about  two  miles  out  until 
10.30  a.m.,  when  a  small  boat  put  off  and  approached  within  a  half  mile  of  shore. 


This  movement  was  evidently  for  the  purpose  of  locating  the  seal  rookery,  for  upon 
discovering  that  there  were  no  seals  at  the  particular  place  the  boat  returned  to  the 
schooner  and  was  taken  about  a  mile  farther  on  to  a  point  opposite  the  breeding  areas 
under  Hutchinson  Hill,  where  it  again  put  off  from  the  schooner  and  headed  for  the  shore. 
The  boat  shortly  afterwards  made  a  landing  about  200  yards  east  of  the  largest  breeding 
area  on  the  island — that  located  under  Hutchinson  Hill — and  a  crew  of  six  Japanese 
disembarked,  pulled  up  the  boat,  and  proceeded  to  cross  the  beach  to  the  grassy  plateau 
beyond. 


A  few  yards  from  the  water’s  edge  they  were  surprised  by  Chief  Agent  Lembkey  and  the 
native  guard  under  his  command  and  in  compliance  with  his  order  threw  up  their  hands 
without  resistance.  In  reply  to  an  inquiry,  one  of  the  landing  party,  who  spoke  some 
English,  stated  to  Mr.  Lembkey  that  they  had  come  ashore  for  water.  It  was  obvious, 
however,  after  investigating  the  contents  of  the  boat,  that  this  statement  was  untrue.  The 
only  receptacle  capable  of  containing  water  carried  by  the  boat  was  a  5-gallon  cask,  which 
was  full  of  fresh  water.  On  the  other  hand,  it  was  manifest  from  the  presence  of  sealing 
clubs,  skinning  knives,  and  other  paraphernalia  for  taking  seals  on  land  that  the  purpose  of 
their  visit  was  to  raid  the  rookery.  The  men  were  accordingly  placed  in  charge  of  a  native 
guard  and  later  in  the  day  were  taken  to  the  village  12  miles  distant  on  the  other  end  of 
the  island.  The  party  effecting  this  capture  consisted  of  Chief  Agent  Lembkey  and  three  or 
four  natives.  The  only  arms  of  the  Government  agent’s  force  were  two  rifles  carried  by  the 
natives. 


The  boat  in  which  the  raiders  landed  was  taken  charge  of  by  the  Government  agents  and 
is  now  in  their  keeping.  It  is  of  the  Otter  boat  type;  about  18  feet  long,  and,  in  addition 


545 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


to  carrying  six  oars,  was  equipped  with  a  mainsail  and  jib.  The  boat  and  its  equipment  is 
typical  of  the  small  boats  usually  carried  by  the  schooners  engaged  in  pelagic  sealing.  The 
oars  were  muffled  and  the  rowlocks  wound  with  rope  which  was  greased  with  tallow,  so 
that  the  boat  might  be  propelled  through  the  water  without  noise.  The  oars  were  fastened 
to  the  boat  so  that  when  suddenly  dropped  they  would  not  float  away,  and  in  front  of  each 
seat  on  both  sides  of  the  boat  and  within  easy  reach  of  the  oarsmen  was  a  canvas  knife 
shield.  The  boat  was  also  provided  with  a  gun  rack.  When  captured,  it  contained  six  sealing 
clubs,  two  skinning  knives,  a  compass,  a  cask  full  of  fresh  water,  some  ship’s  biscuits,  a 
short  sealing  club  for  killing  seals  in  the  water,  and  bamboo  poles  with  iron  hooks  for 
hauling  them  aboard. 

The  seal  rookeries  at  Northeast  Point,  where  the  raid  was  attempted,  are  the  largest  and 
most  extensive  on  the  island.  A  conservative  estimate,  based  upon  an  actual  count  of  seals 
on  certain  portions,  places  the  total  number  of  seals  on  these  particular  rookeries  at  the 
time  of  the  attempted  raid  at  30,000.  Of  these  15,000  were  females. 

During  the  remainder  of  the  day  the  schooner  from  which  the  boat  put  off  continued  to 
cruise  around  Northeast  Point,  sometimes  close  in  shore  and  at  other  times  farther  out,  but 
easily  within  the  3-mile  limit  many  times. 

Upon  my  arrival  at  St.  Paul  Island,  July  20, 1  examined  through  an  interpreter,  the  men 
captured  as  above  described.  They  at  that  time  stated  that  the  name  of  the  schooner  from 
which  they  came  was  the  Dai  Ni  Toyai  Maru,  i.e.,  Toyai  Maru  No.  2;  that  she  carried  a 
crew  of  32  men,  and  had  sailed  from  Hakodate,  Japan,  May  20,  1906.  They  stated  that  she 
was  not  a  pelagic  sealer,  and  denied  that  she  was  one  of  a  regular  Japanese  sealing  fleet, 
but  admitted  that  since  entering  Bering  Sea  she  had  spoken  to  two  or  three  other  Japanese 
schooners,  among  which  they  named  the  Boso  Maru. 


Japanese  Poachers  Killed  By  Native  Guard  July  17 

About  8  o’clock  on  the  morning  of  July  17  the  native  guard  at  Northeast  Point  heard  the 
report  of  shotguns,  which  were  evidently  being  fired  at  seals  in  the  water  a  short  distance 
from  shore.  The  guards  could  not  see  more  than  a  few  yards  owing  to  a  dense  fog,  and 
at  that  time  were  unable  to  make  out  any  boats.  One  of  the  guards  went  inland  to  report 
to  Agent  Lembkey  at  the  watchhouse,  and  the  two  remaining,  Michael  Kozloff  and  John 
Fratis,  proceeded  to  a  point  on  the  shore  opposite  the  firing  and,  concealing  themselves, 
awaited  developments.  About  half  an  hour  later,  during  which  time  the  shotgun  firing 
on  the  water  continued  at  irregular  intervals,  the  guards  discovered  three  boats  a  short 
distance  out  headed  for  the  shore.  The  one  closest  in  contained  three  Japanese,  one  of 
whom  occupied  a  position  in  the  bow  with  a  shotgun  in  his  hands. 

After  the  occupants  of  the  foremost  boat  had  lowered  the  sails,  and  just  as  they  were 
about  to  land  on  the  beach,  the  two  watchmen,  who  had  remained  concealed,  appeared 
on  the  scene  and  shouted,  “Hands  up!”  The  men  in  the  boat  instead  of  complying  with  this 
command  hurriedly  turned  about  and  commenced  to  row  the  boat  away  form  the  shore. 
Guard  Kozloff,  who  was  in  charge,  motioned  with  his  hands  and  called  to  them  to  come 
ashore,  and  when  the  boat  continued  on  her  way  three  rifle  shots  were  fired  in  the  water 
close  to  her.  She  did  not  stop,  however,  and  the  guards  a  few  seconds  later  fired  six  shots 
in  rapid  succession  directly  at  the  boat.  Following  this  shooting  the  men  ceased  to  row  and 
dropped  into  the  bottom  of  the  boat,  and  the  boat  slowly  drifted  in  toward  shore.  The  two 
other  boats  had  in  the  meantime  disappeared  in  the  fog. 

Chief  Agent  Lembkey,  who  arrived  on  the  scene  shortly  after  the  shooting,  recovered  the 
boat  and  it  was  hauled  up  on  the  beach.  Two  of  its  occupants  were  dead  and  the  other  was 
suffering  from  a  wound  in  the  shoulder. 

The  boat  was  of  the  same  type  and  equipment  as  the  one  captured  the  day  before.  Among 
other  things  it  contained  a  quantity  of  food,  fresh  water,  2  loaded  shotguns,  and  146  loaded 
and  9  empty  shells.  Most  of  the  loaded  shells  were  charged  with  buckshot,  although  on 


546 


Biographies  S  ♦  Sims 


subsequent  examination  some  were  found  to  contain  a  heavy  lead  slug  like  a  rifle  bullet. 
The  shotguns  showed  evidence  of  having  been  recently  fired.  The  boat  also  contained  a  seal 
which  apparently  had  been  killed  with  a  charge  of  buckshot  a  short  time  before. 

I  learned  from  the  wounded  prisoner,  whom  I  interviewed  upon  my  arrival  at  the  island, 
that  the  boat  was  not  from  the  schooner  whose  boat  had  been  captured  the  day  previous, 
but  was  from  another  schooner — the  Mei  Maru.  The  prisoner  further  stated  that  the 
schooner  carried  a  crew  of  30  men,  and  had  sailed  from  Hakodate,  Japan,  May  23,  1906. 

At  the  time  the  Japanese  attempted  to  land,  and  when  the  shooting  occurred  as  above 
described,  the  entire  force  on  guard  at  that  point  consisted  of  two  natives,  each  armed  with 
a  rifle. 


Poachers  Off  Zapadni  Rookery  Fired  On 

At  Zapadni  rookery,  which  is  about  12  miles  from  Northeast  Point,  where  the  events  just 
described  took  place,  shotgun  firing  close  inshore  was  heard  at  frequent  intervals  during 
the  day,  and  undoubtedly  a  large  number  of  seals  were  killed  in  the  water.  These  operations 
were  carried  on  under  the  protection  of  a  dense  fog,  and  it  was  not  until  3  o’clock  in  the 
afternoon,  when  it  lifted,  that  the  native  guard  discovered  three  boats  a  short  distance  from 
shore.  The  boats  contained  about  18  men  and  were  headed  for  land.  The  guards,  two  in 
number,  who  were  evidently  excited  over  the  shooting  which  had  been  going  on  around 
them  and  who  believed  that  the  force,  which  greatly  outnumbered  them,  was  about  to  land 
and  raid  the  rookery,  opened  fire  without  delay.  The  boats  immediately  pulled  out  of  sight, 
and  it  is  not  known  whether  any  of  the  marauders  were  injured. 


Poachers  Land  and  Kill  Seals 

Notwithstanding  the  capture  of  the  boat  on  the  morning  of  Tuesday  July  17,  the  reports  of 
shotguns  evidently  fired  at  seals  in  the  water,  were  heard  off  different  parts  of  Northeast 
Point  almost  incessantly  during  the  day.  The  boom  of  cannon,  probably  used  for  the 
purpose  of  signaling  in  the  fog,  was  also  heard  at  frequent  intervals.  The  widely  separated 
points  at  which  these  shots  were  heard  indicate  that  several  boats  were  thus  engaged.  A 
dense  fog  which  hung  over  the  island  partially  lifted  about  8  o’clock  p.m.,  and  disclosed  a 
schooner  riding  at  anchor  less  than  300  yards  from  the  breeding  rookery  on  the  west  side 
of  Northeast  Point.  Although  the  watchmen  failed  to  discover  it,  owing  to  the  fog,  18  or  20 
men  had  landed  and  were  at  that  time  killing  seals  on  the  rookery  close  to  the  water  at  a 
point  where  their  operations  could  not  be  seen  farther  inland. 

The  presence  of  the  schooner  was  immediately  reported  to  the  watchhouse,  and  Chief 
Agent  Lembkey  and  Assistant  Agent  Judge,  at  the  head  of  a  force  of  about  fifteen  natives, 
hurried  to  the  scene.  In  the  meantime  the  raiders,  who  had  evidently  been  warned  of 
the  approach  of  the  native  guard  by  an  outpost,  hurriedly  collected  the  sealskins  already 
taken  and  embarked  in  their  boats,  and  when  the  guard  arrived  at  the  shore  they  were 
already  a  few  yards  off  and  rowing  for  the  schooner.  Upon  their  refusing  to  come  ashore,  in 
compliance  with  an  order  given  by  the  Government  agents,  the  native  guard  was  directed 
to  fire.  This  fire  was  returned  from  the  deck  of  the  schooner,  but  no  one31  of  the  island 
guard  was  injured.  The  boats  soon  came  to  a  stop  and  the  order  was  given  to  cease  firing. 

The  raiding  force  consisted  of  a  flotilla  of  five  small  boats  containing  about  20  men.  It 
appears  that  two  of  the  boats  were  being  used  to  carry  away  skins.  The  force  under  the 
Government  agents  consisted  of  15  native,  only  6  of  whom  were  armed. 

As  the  boats  drew  in  shore  and  it  became  apparent  that  the  raiders  outnumbered  the  native 
force,  Agent  Judge  concluded  that  it  would  be  dangerous  to  attempt  to  capture  the  entire 
party  with  a  force  armed  with  only  six  rifles.  In  consequence  of  this  the  crew  of  only  one  of 
small  boats  were  allowed  to  land,  and  the  remaining  boasts  were  motioned  off  and  returned 
to  the  schooner,  which  still  remained  at  anchor  a  short  distance  from  shore.  Had  the 


547 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


devastation  which  the  raiders  had  wrought  on  the  rookery  been  known  at  this  time,  none 
of  the  boats  would  have  been  permitted  to  return  to  the  schooner. 

The  boat  which  was  compelled  to  return  to  shore  contained,  six  men,  one  of  whom  was 
dead  and  one  wounded.  The  body  of  one  man,  who  had  evidently  fallen  overboard  when 
he  was  shot,  floated  off  and  was  not  picked  up  by  the  boats.  It  is  believed  that  the  body  of  a 
third  was  thrown  overboard  when  the  boats  reached  the  schooner.  The  boats  of  the  raiding 
flotilla  were  of  the  same  general  character  as  those  previously  captured. . . . 

Upon  making  an  examination  of  the  rookeries  at  the  point  where  the  small  boats  were 
first  seen,  the  Government  agents  discovered  that  the  raiders  had  practically  wiped  out  of 
existence  one  section  of  a  breeding  rookery.  More  than  183  seals  had  been  killed.  Of  this 
number,  120  had  been  skinned  and  the  skins  loaded  into  the  boats.  It  was  apparent  that  the 
raiders  had  been  frightened  away  in  the  midst  of  their  raid,  because  63  dead  and  wounded 
seals,  some  partially  skinned  and  other  untouched,  were  found. 

I  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  in  company  with  Hon.  George  M.  Bowers,  Commissioner  of 
Fisheries,  on  the  afternoon  of  July  20,  1906,  on  the  revenue  cutter  McCulloch,  Capt.  J.C. 

Cantwell  commanding.  The  Government  agents  and  the  natives  were  very  anxious  to  get 
rid  of  the  [twelve32]  prisoners  and  they  were  at  once  turned  over  to  the  McCulloch,  which 
proceeded  to  Unalaska.  At  that  place  the  ten  uninjured  men  were  turned  over  to  the  deputy 
United  States  marshal,  and  the  wounded  men,  who  had  been  placed  under  the  care  of  Dr. 

T.B.  McClintic,  were  retained  on  the  cutter. 

The  prisoners  were  again  taken  on  board  the  cutter  on  July  31  and  carried  from  Unalaska  to 
Kodiak,  where  a  preliminary  hearing  was  had  before  United  States  Commissioner  Fred  D. 

Kelsey.  As  a  result  of  this  hearing  they  were  held  to  the  grand  jury  and  were  turned  over  to 
the  custody  of  United  States  Marshal  L.L.  Bowers,  at  Kodiak,  for  delivery  at  Valdez.  Chief 
Agent  W.I.  Lembkey  and  the  native  witnesses  then  proceeded  to  Valdez  [aboard  the  mail 
steamer  Dora33]. 34 

Five  of  the  prisoners  pleaded  guilty  of  having  killed  seals.  Six  others  were  convicted  of  an 
attempt  to  kill  seals,  while  the  remaining  prisoner,  after  a  trial  in  which  the  jury  failed  to 
agree,  pleaded  guilty  to  the  charge  of  killing  seals,  and  all  were  sentenced  by  United  States 
District  Judge  Royal  A.  Gunnison  to  three  months’  imprisonment  in  the  United  States  jail 
at  Valdez.  At  the  expiration  of  their  sentences  all  the  prisoners  were  deported  to  Japan.35 

President  Theodore  Roosevelt  said  in  his  message  to  the  beginning  of  the  second 
session  of  the  59th  Congress  (December  1906),  concerning  the  investigation  in  the  Seal 
Islands,  “I  commend  your  attention  to  the  report  by  Mr.  Sims,  Solicitor  of  the  Department 
of  Commerce  and  Labor,  on  this  subject.”36

Their  son,  Frederick  Speers,  died  July  31, 1971,  at  Escondido,  California,  after  a  successful 
career  as  a  newspaper  publisher  in  Escondido  and  in  North  Platte,  Nevada.42 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Dr.  Will  F.  Speers  became  the  physician  for  the  Pribilovians  at  Funter  Bay  in  1943, 43  and 
he  wrote  about  his  experiences  to  friends  in  personal  letters.  His  somewhat  dreary  assess¬ 
ment  echoed  those  of  the  agents  at  the  Funter  Bay  camps,  but  he  also  spoke  to  the  posi¬ 
tive  spirit  of  the  Aleuts  in  acknowledging  their  Funter  Bay  and  homecoming  tragedies. 
The  following  excerpts  are  from  one  such  letter. 

The  trip  from  Funter  Bay  was  in  a  way  uneventful. . . .  We  stopped  at  Kodiak  for  48  hours 
and  there  picked  up  a  couple  of  convoy  ships  and  two  escorting  ones,  we  stopped  again 
at  Dutch  Harbor  where  we  took  on  some  native  troops  for  duty  on  the  island  during  the 
sealing  season.  Neither  of  these  two  places  was  interesting  in  more  than  name  only.  All  the 
time  I  was  aboard  ship  I  was  kept  very  busy  due  to  the  fact  that  we  had  approximately  500 
men,  women  and  children  sleeping  on  3  tier  high  canvas  bunks  in  two  forward  holds  and 
conditions  were  far  from  being  comfortable  for  them.  Being  two  weeks  on  the  boat  it  was 
only  natural  that  there  should  be  an  epidemic  of  colds  and  influenza  break  out  in  addition 
to  sea  sickness  and  sundry  of  other  diseases. 

It  was  with  a  great  deal  of  relief  that  we  sighted  St.  Paul  Island  on  May  13th.  We  anchored 
off  shore  as  there  are  no  piers  and  every  thing  including  all  passengers  had  to  be  lightered 
off.  It  took  two  weeks  to  unload  the  ship  as  there  were  times  due  to  wheather  [sic]  when 
nothing  could  be  done.  I  went  off  in  a  hurry  on  the  evening  of  the  14th  as  one  of  my 
patients  was  kind  enough  to  wait  until  she  landed  to  give  birth  to  a  nice  little  baby  girl. 

Every  thing  went  along  fine.  Am  expecting  one  a  month  from  now  on  and  maybe  more. 

We  were  all  due  for  terrible  discouraging  times.  The  army  had  been  occupying  the  village 
during  the  natives’  absence  and  as  they  had  to  leave  in  such  a  hurry  they  left  their  house 
and  contents  virtually  intact.  Soldiers  moved  in  and  in  many  instances  completely  wrecked 
the  interior  of  the  house.  All  these  people  were  so  proud  of  their  little  homes.  They  were 
nice  little  4  room  concrete  houses  completely  furnished.  The  army  took  over,  broke  into 
houses,  drove  nails  in  the  walls,  deliberately  destroyed  furniture,  radios,  stoves,  bedding, 
and  every  thing.  To  make  a  long  story  short  it  was  a  fine  piece  of  sabotage  and  nothing  else 
will  describe  it.  Many  of  these  people  had  no  beds  left  in  their  houses  nor  stoves.  Furniture 
was  moved  from  one  house  to  another  and  wrecked.  Their  linens  and  towels  and  bedding 
were  either  destroyed  or  used  as  cleaning  rags  and  when  dirty  was  thrown  in  a  heap  in 
some  corner  of  the  house.  All  this  also  applies  to  my  house,  my  hospital  and  my  dispensary. 

We  all  know  now  about  the  ravages  of  war  but  it  is  hard  to  learn  it  coming  from  your  own 
soldiers.  Enough  of  this! 

The  village  was  just  as  I  imagined  and  basically  lovely,  located  on  a  hill  on  a  peninsula  at  the 
south  end  of  the  island.  Every  house  has  a  wonderful  view  on  one  side  or  the  other  of  the 
sea. 

My  house  with  the  dispensary  in  connection  and  the  hospital  are  marvels.  There  is  a  little 
entrance  hall  to  the  house  and  from  this  is  a  door  leading  to  the  dispensary  with  its  three 
connecting  rooms  each  about  12  x  12,  another  door  takes  one  into  my  portion  of  the  house 
which  consists  of  living  room,  2  bed  rooms  and  a  marvelous  kitchen  with  a  breakfast  nook 
and  a  gas  stove  for  cooking,  and  a  tiled  bath  room.  Up  stairs  is  a  large  servants  room  the 
remaining  being  partially  finished. 

The  hospital  is  about  50  feet  from  the  house  and  I  go  out  a  side  entrance  to  a  semi¬ 
basement  entrance  in  the  hospital.  In  the  basement  1  have  a  big  X-Ray  room  also  a  Dark 
room,  laundry  room  and  linen  room,  on  the  first  floor  is  a  waiting  room,  2  rooms  for  the 
dentist,  2  three  bed  wards  and  a  bath  and  a  kitchen.  On  the  second  floor  is  two  more  three

bed  wards  and  bath  that  are  used  chiefly  for  tubercular  patients.  I  have  a  registered  nurse,  2 
native  nurses  and  a  janitor.  Both  places  have  hot  water  heat  &  electricity.  Have  a  wonderful 
supply  of  drugs  and  operating  equipment. 

We  had  a  dance  last  night  given  by  the  Foulk  [sic]  Fur  Co  to  every  one  and  today  July  4th 
they  put  on  a  celebration  with  foot  races,  pie  eating  contest,  ect.  ect.  [sic].  They  do  this 
every  year  but  it  was  especially  big  this  year  due  to  the  soldiers  present.  The  dance  was 
really  nice.  All  the  civilian  employees  with  their  wives  (6  wives)  were  there  and  the  natives 
and  about  30  [native]  soldiers.  The  native  girls  were  a  surprise  to  every  one.  They  were 
all  so  nicely  dressed  and  the  soldiers.  What  a  time  they  had.  Some  of  those  boys  had  not 
danced  with  a  girl  for  two  years  and  when  they  turned  loose  their  jitter  bug  and  rug  cutting 
antics  it  really  was  something.  Needless  to  say  a  good  time  was  had  by  all.  The  dance  hall 
is  on  the  second  story  of  the  Community  building  is  about  40  by  60  feet  with  a  nice  hard 
wood  well  waxed  floor.  The  orchestra  consisted  of  two  pianos,  3  guitars,  a  banjo  and  a 
mandolin. 

Today  at  two  P.  M.  July  4th  started  for  the  kids.  Pink  lemonade,  foot  races,  nickel  scramble 
and  pie  eating  contest.  The  nickel  scramble  was  good.  A  wash  tub  was  half  filled  with 
oatmeal  and  in  it  a  double  handful  of  nickels  was  stirred.  15  youngsters  raced  to  the  tub  to 
dig  the  nickels  out.  They  all  tried  to  get  in  it  at  once,  eventually  the  tub  was  overturned  with 
nickels  and  oatmeal  scattered  all  over  the  road.  It  turned  out  to  be  one  of  the  finest  jam 
sessions  I’ve  ever  seen.  They  finally  got  all  the  money.  A  rolling  pin  throwing  contest  for  the 
women  at  a  dummy  was  not  bad  either. 

It  was  marvelous  to  see  the  miriaculous  [sic]  change  that  has  taken  place  in  these  people 
since  returning  here  to  their  island  from  the  primitive  filthy  place  that  they  were  living  in 
at  Funter  Bay.  There  many  of  their  dwelling  places  were  so  filthy  that  no  description  fits 
them,  the  people  were  sullen,  discontented  and  down  hearted  and  wanted  only  to  get  back 
here  to  their  homes.  Arriving  here  every  thing  changed  the  enthusiasm  that  they  showed  in

cleaning  up  their  houses,  scrubbing  floors,  washing  walls  and  ceilings,  making  temporary 
furniture  to  replace  that  the  army  had  destroyed  all  was  done  with  never  a  complaint 
that  was  sincere.  They  were  glad  to  do  it.  Now  that  their  places  are  back  again  to  some 
semblance  of  what  they  were  two  year  ago  they  are  paying  some  attention  to  their  families. 
In  Funter,  impetigo  and  little  crawly  things  in  the  hair,  dirty  clothes  and  faces  were  almost 
general  amongst  the  children.  Now  every  thing  has  changed,  no  impetigo,  clean  heads  and 
clothes  and  in  every  way  different. 

The  men  go  hunting  when  they  have  time  for  some  of  the  various  birds  that  abound  every 
place.  Again  they  do  their  hunting  at  times  by  lying  back  of  a  big  rock  with  a  long  handled 
net  in  their  hands  and  when  a  flock  of  caushuskies  [choochkies  or  least  auklets]  come  flying 
over  up  goes  the  net  and  several  of  these  birds  are  caught.  They  are  a  small  bird  slightly 
larger  than  a  robin  and  their  breasts  make  wonderful  eating.  Yesterday  a  group  of  natives 
went  out  to  one  of  the  cliffs  and  came  back  with  a  couple  of  buckets  filled  with  eggs  that 
were  slightly  smaller  that  [sic]  the  average  hen  egg.  They  were  white  and  sort  of  spotted 
with  green  [murre  eggs]. 

The  women  are  good  cooks  and  like  to  bake  bread  and  cakes.  Seal  meat,  hearts  and  livers 
are  also  included  in  their  diet.  Seal  liver  is  a  real  delicacy,  like  calf  liver.  The[re]  is  a  nice 
little  Russian  church  here  presided  over  by  Father  Baranoff  who  is  well  thought  of  by  all  the 
natives.  They  are  quite  religious  and  all  expenses  of  the  church  including  the  priests  salary 
is  paid  from  the  community  or  canteen  fund.  The  canteen  is  no  small  institution.  They 
sell  items  of  clothing,  food,  candy,  ect.  [sic],  that  are  not  issued  by  the  government.  It  is 
purely  a  native  affair  entirely  run  by  them,  They  at  the  present  time  have  a  cash  balance  of 
over  $16,000.  Funds  are  spent  on  anything  that  is  of  benefit  to  the  entire  group.  They  have 
a  fine  movie  outfit,  recently  bought  a  good  juke  box  and  a  couple  of  pool  tables.  The  men 
are  inveterate  gambles  [sic]  and  not  small  ones  either.  Money  doesn’t  mean  a  lot  to  them 
as  a  whole  other  than  to  buy  luxuries  or  something  better  than  the  ordinary.  They  all  have

radios  and  all  manner  of  household  equipment. 
They  all  buy  through  Sears  Roebuck  and  sometimes 
it  seems  as  though  they  order  the  entire  catalogue. 
The  government  gives  them  house  rent  free,  two 
clothing  issues  a  year  and  provisions  dependent 
upon  the  size  of  the  family  besides  furnishing, 
doctor,  dentist  and  school  teachers.  When  they 
get  too  old  they  are  pensioned.  They  get  so  much 
for  each  sealskin,  this  amount  goes  into  a  pot  and 
is  apportioned  out  according  to  a  mans  standing 
1st,  2nd  or  3rd  class.  Their  account  is  credited 
with  the  amount  due  them  and  they  can  draw  any 
reasonable  amount  through  the  agent  at  any  time. 

It  is  the  life  of  Reilley.  Where  else  in  the  world  is 
there  a  group  of  people  born  into  such  security. 
They  have  what  we  are  striving  a  life  time  for. 

During  sealing  and  foxing  seasons  there  is  a  few 
weeks  of  hard  work,  after  that  mostly  maintenance

Stanley-Brown,  Joseph  (1858-1941) 

Geologist 

Special  Treasury  Agent,  1891-1893 

Superintendent,  North  American  Commercial  Company,  1893-1899 

Genealogy 

Joseph  Stanley-Brown  was  born  August  19, 
1858,  in  Washington,  D.C.  Joseph  was  the  son  of 
John  Leopold  Brown,  a  carpenter,  and  Elizabeth 
Frances  (Marr)  Stanley.  Joseph’s  grandfather 
Nathaniel  Stanley  had  fled  to  Holland,  presum¬ 
ably  to  escape  an  English  debtors  prison,  in  1819. 
“Under  the  name  of  James  Brown,  [Nathaniel 
Stanley]  came  to  Baltimore  with  his  wife  and 
two  small  sons  [John  and  Thomas],  becoming 
a  naturalized  citizen  under  that  name.  When 
the  records  were  verified  in  1888,  James’  grand¬ 
son  Joseph  adopted  the  surname  of  “Stanley- 
Brown”45  at  the  urging  of  his  mother-in-law, 
Mrs.  James  Garfield.  Joseph  Brown  had  married 
former  President  James  Garfield’s  daughter  Mary 
(1867-1947)  on  June  14,  1888,  in  Mentor,  Ohio. 
Mrs.  James  Garfield  told  him,  “Joseph,  you’ll  lose 
that  Stanley  from  your  name  if  you  don’t  annex  it 
permanently.”46  Joseph  and  Mary  had  three  chil¬ 
dren.  Rudolph  (1889-1944)  became  an  artist  and 
architect,  and  married  Katherine  Schermerhorn  Oliver;  Ruth  (1892-1981)  was  a  writer 
and  editor  and  married  diplomatic  historian  and  State  Department  official  Herbert  Feis; 
Margaret  (1895-1958),  graduated  from  Vassar  in  1919,  became  a  surgeon,  and  married 
Max  K.  Sellers. 

Joseph  Stanley-Brown  died  on  November  2,  1941,  in  Pasadena,  California.  Urns 
containing  the  ashes  of  Joseph  and  Mary  Garfield  Stanley-Brown  reside  in  the  Garfield 
Mausoleum  Monument,  next  to  those  of  President  Garfield  and  his  wife  Lucretia,  at  Lake 
View  Cemetery  in  Cleveland,  Ohio.47 

Biographical  Sketch 

At  seventeen,  Joseph  Stanley-Brown  left  Seton  High  School  in  Washington,  D.C., 

to  become  stenographer  and  secretary  to  John  Wesley  Powell  (q.v.),  then  in  charge  of  a 
geological  survey  in  the  Rocky  Mountains. 

At  the  same  time,  to  acquire  technical  knowledge,  he  studied  chemistry,  anatomy  and 
physiology  at  night  in  the  medical  department  of  Columbian  (later  George  Washington) 

University.  At  that  time  Powell  was  endeavoring  to  consolidate  the  three  independent 
geological  surveys  being  supported  by  the  government  and  in  seeking  congressional

support  for  his  plan  [he]  approached  General  James  A.  Garfield  (q.v.),  then  a  representative 
from  Ohio. . . .  From  1878-1880,  Stanley-Brown  acted  as  Garfield’s  secretary,  without  pay, 
in  addition  to  his  regular  duties  in  the  geological  office.  On  July  1,  1879,  Powell’s  efforts 
culminated  in  the  establishment  of  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey,  whereupon  Stanley-Brown 
spent  five  months  as  secretary  of  a  public  land  commission,  making  a  tour  of  inspection  to 
the  Pacific  coast.  With  Garfield’s  nomination  as  presidential  candidate  he  left  the  geological 
survey  to  become  personal  secretary  to  Garfield  and  on  his  inauguration  returned  to 
Washington  as  private  secretary  to  the  President.48 

After  President  Garfield’s  death,  Mrs.  Garfield  requested  that  Stanley-Brown  remain 
in  Washington,  D.C.,  to  assist  her  in  cataloging  and  indexing  the  late  president’s  per¬ 
sonal  papers.  After  a  year's  work,  she  provided  financial  assistance  for  him  to  attend  Yale 
University’s  Sheffield  Scientific  School,  where  he  graduated  with  a  PhD  in  1888. 

Following  Yale  and  a  year  of  graduate  studies  at  the  University  of  Heidelberg,  Stanley- 
Brown  became  an  assistant  geologist  at  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey.  During  his  tenure  at 
the  Geological  Survey,  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior  at  the  request  of  the  Secretary  of  the 
Treasury  ordered  Stanley-Brown  to  the  Pribilof  Islands  to  gather  information  in  support 
of  the  United  States  over  a  growing  dispute  with  Great  Britain  concerning  legal  rights 
to  hunt  the  fur  seal  in  the  Bering  Sea.  Upon  his  return  to  Washington  in  1893,  Stanley- 
Brown  accepted  a  position  with  the  North  American  Commercial  Company  (NACC)  as 
superintendent  of  its  Pribilof  Islands  concession.  As  superintendent, 

he  had  charge  of  the  company’s  affairs  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  and  Unalaska.  There,  in  the 
summer  of  1898,  he  met  Edward  H.  Harriman.  The  next  year  at  Harriman’s  request  he 
became  assistant  secretary  of  the  Union  Pacific  and  Southern  Pacific  railway  systems.  For 
three  years,  he  traveled  extensively  in  this  country  and  Mexico  as  Harriman’s  personal 
representative.  In  1902,  he  became  assistant  to  William  H.  Baldwin  (q.v),  president  of  the 
Long  Island  Railroad  Company.  Upon  the  latter’s  death  the  following  year,  Stanley-Brown 
became  associated  with  the  New  York  investment  banking  house  of  Fisk  &  Robinson,  in 
charge  of  its  railway  investments  and  the  examination  of  properties  that  the  firm  was  asked 
to  finance.  In  1915,  he  became  the  partner  of  George  H.  Robinson  in  the  successor  firm  of 
Robinson  &  Co.,  continuing  until  January  1929,  when  the  partners  disposed  of  their  entire 
interests  to  Sutro  &  Co.  of  San  Francisco  and  retired.  Although  for  nearly  forty  years  he 
was  identified  with  large  financial  and  industrial  developments,  he  retained  his  interest  in 
scientific  matters  and  was  active  from  the  beginning  in  the  Geological  Society  of  America, 
serving  as  editor  of  its  proceedings  from  1892-1941.49 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

While  Joseph  Stanley-Brown  was  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  1891  at  the  behest  of  Secretary 
of  the  Treasury  Charles  Foster,  Great  Britain  and  the  United  States  agreed  to  submit 
their  dispute  over  pelagic  sealing  to  international  arbitration.  He  returned  to  the  Pribilofs 
and  was  there  from  June  16  through  August  3,  1892,  to  “prepare  comparative  data  for 
Secretary  of  State  John  W.  Foster.  In  March  1893,  he  sailed  for  France,  as  expert  with  the 
American  commission  to  the  Paris  tribunal  which  in  August  of  that  year  held  that  the 
United  States  had  no  right  to  set  up  a  mare  clausum  [closed  sea]  and  that  damages  must 
be  paid  for  seized  vessels,  but  consented  to  certain  regulations  for  seal  hunting.  These 
[decisions]  proved  disastrous  for  the  protection  of  seal  herds  and  it  was  not  until  1911 
that  the  matter  was  finally  settled.”30

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Stanley-Brown’s  decision  to  accept  a  position  as  superintendent  with  the  NACC  after 
his  return  from  the  Fur-Seal  Arbitration  hearings  may  have  been  influenced  in  part  by  a 
minor  scandal  over  his  pay  while  he  was  in  the  service  of  the  U.S.  government.  The  allega¬ 
tions  involved  several  others  as  well,  although  the  focus  of  the  attack  appeared  to  be  on 
actions  of  Secretary  of  State,  John  Foster.  However,  regarding  Stanley-Brown,  a  news  story 
under  the  headline  “The  Double  Pay  Scandal”  stated  in  part  that  “according  to  the  records 
of  the  State  Department,  [Stanley-Brown]  is  on  the  staff  of  the  Bering  Sea  Commission  at 
$15  per  day.  But  the  records  of  the  Treasury  Department  also  disclose  that  Mr.  Brown  is 
commissioned  as  an  officer  of  the  Treasury  Department  to  make  certain  investigations  of 
seal  life  for  which  he  is  drawing  pay  at  the  rate  of  $10  per  day.  Thus,  Mr.  Brown  receives 
$25  per  day,  which  is  $9,125  per  year,  or  more  than  the  pay  of  a  Cabinet  officer.”’1 

Stanley-Brown  served  as  NACC  superintendent  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  from  1894 
to  1899.  On  October  8,  1897,  Treasury  Agent  Joseph  Murray  wrote  in  the  St.  Paul  Island 
Agent’s  Log: 

Today  the  Natives’  Library  was  opened  for  the  season,  and  when  Agent  Murray  visited 
there  this  evening  he  found  it  well  patronized  by  both  old  and  young  men:  -  some  reading 
and  some  learning  to  play  the  new  games  sent  up  from  San  Francisco. 

Mr.  Joseph  Stanley-Brown,  Lessees  Agent,  very  kindly  gave  the  use  of  a  house,  cleared, 
repaired  and  fitted  up  for  a  Library;  and  the  natives  have  shown  more  appreciation  of  this 
action  than  I  have  ever  known  them  to  show  for  anything  else. 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Joseph  Stanley-Brown  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  May  9,  1892,  before 
Notary  Public  Sevellon  A.  Brown  at  Washington,  D.C.,  a  portion  of  which  follows. 

I  am  36  years  of  age;  am  a  citizen  of  the  United  States;  reside  in  Mentor,  Ohio;  am  by 
profession  a  geologist,  and  as  such  am  employed  in  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey.  In  April, 

1891. 1  was  ordered  by  the  honorable  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior,  to  whose  direction  the 
officers  of  the  Geological  Survey  are  subject,  to  report  to  the  honorable  the  Secretary  of 
the  Treasury  [Charles  Foster]  personally  for  special  service.  This  I  did,  and  on  the  27th  of 
that  month  I  received  from  the  latter  a  temporary  appointment  as  special  agent.  On  May 

4. 1  was  given  instruction  to  visit  the  Pribilof  Islands,  for  the  purpose  of  studying  the  seal 
life  . . .  with  the  view  of  procuring  full  and  accurate  information  not  only  as  to  its  present 
general  condition,  but  also  more  specifically  as  to  any  increase  or  diminution  of  the  seal 
herd. . . . 

In  the  prosecution  of  my  investigations  I  deemed  it  desirable  to  photograph  all  the 
rookeries  often  from  two  positions;  to  make  a  general  topographic  survey  of  both  islands 
on  a  scale  of  1  mile  to  the  inch  and  to  prepare  detailed  charts  of  the  rookeries  upon  the 
unusually  large  scale  of  264  feet  to  the  inch.  In  carrying  out  this  work  I  examined  the 
entire  shorelines  of  St.  Paul  and  St.  George,  and  there  is  not  an  area  of  a  mile  square  upon 
either  that  I  have  not  traversed  nor  a  square  hundred  feet  upon  a  rookery  that  I  have  not 
repeatedly  inspected.  The  close  attention  to  topographic  forms  demanded  in  platting 
rookeries  with  so  much  minuteness  and  the  care  required  in  selecting  the  best  positions 
to  secure  photographs  inevitably  drew  me  in  close  contact  with  seal  life. ...  In  all  my  work 
upon  the  islands  I  was  constantly  attended  by  native  Aleuts,  who  assisted  in  transporting 
my  instruments  and  other  impedimenta.  Several  of  these  could  speak  fair  English.  Our 
intimate  daily  relations,  which  extended  over  nearly  three  months,  were  under  conditions 
that  offered  neither  incentive  to  secrecy  nor  to  deception,  and,  while  their  general  views 
on  and  theory  of  seal  life  are  to  be  received  with  caution,  they  are  keen  observers  of  little

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Biographical  Sketch 

Gabriel  Stepetin  was  a  St.  Paul  Island  leader  for  many  years.  He  spoke  of  his  life  history  in 
the  documentary  Islands  of  Time  (Patricia  Stanley,  producer,  and  Dennis  Remick,  writer; 
Fort  Yukon,  AI<:  Silky  Way  Productions)  made  with  the  Council  of  Athabascan  Tribal 
Governments. 

According  to  St.  Paul  Island  elder  Larry  Merculieff,  “Gabe  had  written  down  what  ra¬ 
tions  people  had  during  the  food  rationing  days  in  the  1940s  and  ’50s — mostly  bread  and 
water  and  whatever  they  could  get  hunting.”  He  also  spoke  of  their  education.  He  said  that 
“all  they  were  taught  to  say  is  ‘yes  sir,  no  sir’  and  the  rest  of  the  time  they  played  music 
records  in  class  or  played  with  toys  and  he  felt  embarrassed  that  he  would  be  in  the  same 
classes  as  little  kids.”  In  his  day,  when  a  man  reached  the  age  of  sixteen,  he  had  to  work 
for  the  government. 

During  the  islanders’  relocation  to  Funter  Bay,  some  of  the  men  met  leaders  of  the 
Alaska  Native  Brotherhood  (ANB)  in  Juneau.  The  ANB  was  at  the  forefront  of  the  Alaska 
Native  human  rights  movement.  Following  repatriation  to  the  Pribilof  Islands,  some  St. 
Paul  men  formed  an  ANB  chapter.  Members  had  difficulty  planning  their  freedom  be¬ 
cause  the  agent  refused  to  allow  meetings  of  any  sort.  Gabe  came  up  with  the  idea  of  put¬ 
ting  on  plays  and  skits  for  the  white  people  in  the  village.  The  government  agent  agreed. 
At  times  when  they  were  supposed  to  be  preparing  for  a  play,  the  men  met  secretly.  They 
discussed  organizing  an  Indian  Reorganization  Act  of  1932  (IRA)  chartered  tribal  entity. 
In  addition  to  Gabe,  members  of  the  clandestine  group  included  Iliodor  Merculieff, 
Alexander  Melovidov,  Terenty  Philemonof  Sr.,  and  Elary  Gromoff.  With  the  help  of  Felix 
Cohen,  attorney  for  ANB,  in  1950  they  succeeded  in  organizing  an  IRA  entity  under  U.S. 
laws,  and  launched  a  claim  against  the  U.S.  government  for  breach  of  duty  to  treat  their 
people  fairly  and  honorably.  The  claim  was  successfully  prosecuted  in  1976. 

Gabe  Stepetin  served  as  the  store  manager  for  the  government  for  many  years  and 
finally  negotiated  with  the  government  to  pass  ownership  of  the  store  to  the  tribe  in  the 
1960s.  He  was  active  in  the  freedom  battle,  including  smuggling  letters  off  the  island  to 
Howard  Rock,  then  editor  of  the  only  statewide  Alaska  Native  newspaper,  the  Tundra 
Times.  Rock  published  the  letters,  which  came  to  the  attention  of  the  Human  Rights 
Commission  headed  by  Willard  Bowman  (see  Bowman’s  biography).  The  commission 
held  hearings  on  the  island,  and  Gabe  Stepetin  testified,  along  with  Elary  Gromoff  Sr., 
Mamant  Emanoff,  Peter  Kochergin,  and  John  Misikin.  Their  testimony  spurred  a  con¬ 
gressional  investigation  instigated  by  then-U.S.  Senator  from  Alaska  Bob  Bartlett  (see 
Bartlett’s  biography),  resulting  in  the  Pribilovian  civil  rights  bill,  ironically  called  the  Fur 
Seal  Act  of  1966.  The  Act  allowed  the  Aleuts  for  the  first  time  to  participate  in  state  and 
federal  elections,  to  organize  a  city  under  state  laws,  and  to  have  the  government  homes 
transferred  to  the  people  occupying  them.  Gabe  Stepetin  served  as  the  tribal  president. 

In  1968,  Stepetin  hired  college  students  Patrick  Pletnikoff,  from  St.  George  Island, 
and  Larry  Merculieff,  from  St.  Paul  Island,  to  lobby  in  Washington,  D.C.,  for  funds  to 
implement  the  Act  and  create  a  city  form  of  government.  They  succeeded  in  securing  the

Sumner,  Charles  (1811-1874) 

U.S.  Senator,  Massachusetts,  1851-1874 

Genealogy 

Charles  Sumner  was  born  on  January  6,  1811, 
in  Boston,  Massachusetts,  to  Charles  Pinckney 
Sumner  and  Relief  (Jacobs)  Sumner.  Charles 
Sumner  died  on  March  11,  1874,  at  Washington, 
D.C.61 

Biographical  Sketch 

Charles  Sumner  graduated  from  Harvard 
University  in  1830  and  from  Harvard  Law  School 
in  1833.  He  opened  his  law  office  in  Boston,  where 
he  became  politically  active.  He  served  in  the 
U.S.  Senate  from  1851  to  1874,  and  was  a  leader 
among  the  opponents  of  slavery.  “His  vitriolic  at¬ 
tacks  upon  slavery  and  its  defenders  brought  a  physical  assault  on  him  by  Representative 
Preston  S.  Brooks  of  South  Carolina  (May  22,  1856),  inflicting  injuries  from  which 
he  never  fully  recovered.  He  was  the  first  prominent  statesman  to  urge  emancipation 
(October  1861).”62 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Charles  Sumner  served  as  chairman  of  the  Senate’s  United  States  Committee  on  Foreign 
Affairs.  In  that  position,  he  was  perhaps  best-known  for  his  three-hour  “Speech  of  Hon. 
Charles  Sumner  of  Massachusetts  on  the  cession  of  Russian  America  to  the  United 
States”  delivered  on  April  9,  1867.63  In  preparation  for  the  speech,  Sumner  invested  heav¬ 
ily  in  researching  the  facts  about  the  history  of  Russian  America,  the  financial  benefits  of 
the  purchase,  and  geographical  and  environmental  descriptions  of  the  country.  For  this 
information  he  depended  on  materials  from  the  Congressional  Library  and  from  naviga¬ 
tors,  explorers,  and  naturalists  such  as  the  Smithsonian  Institution’s  Spencer  F.  Baird,  and 
Henry  Martyn  Bannister,  Ferdinand  Bischoff,  William  H.  Dali,  George  Gibbs,  and  Charles 
Bryant.  Sumner  also  relied  on  the  reports  of  Robert  Kennicott  (1859-1862  explorations), 
Henry  Bannister,  and  Charles  Pease  (Western  Union  Telegraph  Expedition).64 

Sumner  opened  his  speech  with:

Biographies  S  ♦  Stepetin  -  Sumner 


Mr.  President:  You  have  just  listened  to  the  reading  of  the  treaty  by  which  Russia  cedes  to 
the  United  States  all  her  possessions  on  the  North  American  continent  in  consideration  of 
$7,200,000,  to  be  paid  by  the  United  States.  On  the  one  side  is  the  cession  of  a  vast  country 
with  its  jurisdiction  and  its  resources  of  all  kinds;  on  the  other  side  is  the  purchase-money. 

Such  is  this  transaction  on  its  face.65 

The  speech  covered  the  climate,  indigenous  populations,  and  natural  resources,  in¬ 
cluding  those  found  on  the  Pribilof  Islands. 

There  has  been  much  exaggeration  with  regard  to  the  profits  of  the  Russian  corporation. 

An  English  writer  of  authority  calls  them  “immense,”  and  adds  that  formerly  they  were 
much  greater.  The  number  of  skins  reported  at  times  is  prodigious  although  this  fails  to 
reveal  precisely  the  profits.  For  instance,  Pribilof  collected  within  two  years  on  the  islands 
north  of  Alaska,  which  bear  his  name,  the  skins  of  2,000  sea  otter,  6,000  dark  ice  foxes, 

40,000  sea  bears  or  ursine  seals,  together  with  1,000  poods  of  walrus  ivory.  The  pood  is 
a  Russian  weight  of  thirty-six  pounds.  Lutke  mentions  that  in  1803  no  less  than  800,000 
skins  of  the  ursine  seal  were  accumulated  in  the  factory  at  Ounalaska  of  which  700,000 
were  thrown  into  the  sea.  From  1787  to  1817  . . .  the  Ounalaska  district  yielded  upwards  of 
2,500,000  seal  skins;  and  from  1817  to  1838,  during  which  time  the  company  was  in  power, 
the  same  district  yielded  upwards  of  579,000  seal  skins.  Assuming  what  is  improbable, 
that  these  skins  were  sold  at  twenty-five  rubles  each,  some  calculating  genius  has  ciphered 
out  the  sum  total  of  proceeds  at  more  than  eighty-five  million  rubles;  or  calling  the  ruble 
seventy-five  cents,  a  total  of  more  than  sixty-three  million  dollars.66 

By  a  vote  of  thirty-seven  to  two  on  June  20, 1867,  the  Senate  ratified  President  Andrew 
Johnson’s  March  30,  1867,  Treaty  Concerning  the  Cession  of  the  Russian  Possessions 
in  North  America  by  his  Majesty  the  Emperor  of  all  the  Russias  to  the  United  States  of 
America.  In  1944,  diplomat  and  international  law  specialist  David  Hunter  Miller  wrote  of 
Senator  Sumner’s  influence: 

It  is  generally  thought,  and  with  good  reason,  that  the  Alaska  Treaty  would  not  have 
been  approved  by  the  Senate  if  it  had  not  been  supported  by  Senator  Charles  Sumner, 
of  Massachusetts.  In  1867  Sumner  was  a  national  figure  and  one  of  the  most  important 
leaders  of  the  Republican  Party;  he  was  Chairman  of  the  Senate  Committee  on  Foreign 
Relations;  he  was  outstanding  in  the  opposition  to  President  Johnson,  an  opposition  which 
had  a  majority  in  both  Houses  of  Congress;  any  policy,  and  particularly  any  foreign  policy, 
of  the  administration  which  Sumner  then  advocated  was  well-nigh  certain  of  success  in  the 
Senate. 

It  has  been  pointed  out  above  that  Sumner  learned  of  the  Alaska  Treaty  about  midnight 
of  March  29-30  and  that  his  first  attitude  was  noncommittal;  nine  days  later,  on  April  8, 

Sumner  reported  the  treaty  favorably  from  committee  and  made  his  celebrated  speech  for 
it.67 

It  is  worth  noting  that  within  forty  years  the  U.S.  Treasury  recovered  $9,800,000 
through  revenues  earned  from  the  Pribilof  Islands  fur-seal  industry,68  an  amount  consid¬ 
erably  more  than  the  purchase  price  of  the  Territory  of  Alaska.

Minnesota,  August  14,  1858.  Nelly  married 
Edward  Orr  Stafford,  son  of  Marquette  druggist 
Henry  Hinckley  Stafford  and  Catherine  Lewis,  at 
Marquette,  Michigan,  February  6,  1884.  Psyche 
died  at  Marquette,  Michigan  in  1881.  Alfred  mar¬ 
ried  a  second  time  in  1886  to  Minnie  Smith  in 
Michigan.  Alfred  Peter  Swineford  died  October 
26,  1909,  at  Juneau,  Alaska,  and  his  remains  were 
interred  at  Marquette,  Michigan.69 

Biographical  Sketch 

Alfred  P.  Swineford’s  daughter,  Nelly  Flower, 
wrote  the  following  biography  of  Swineford’s 
life  while  pursuing  her  Michigan  application  for 
membership  in  the  Marquette  Chapter  of  the 
Daughters  of  the  American  Revolution: 

Alfred  [Swineford]  was  the  great  grandson  of 
Albrecht  Schweinforth  born  in  Bavaria,  Germany, 
who  came  to  America  in  1754.  Alfred  Swineford  came  to  Cheboygan,  Michigan  from 
Cleveland,  Ohio,  by  steamer  in  1853.  He  did  not  remain  long  in  Cheboygan  but  went  into 
Wisconsin  and  Minnesota  where  he  did  newspaper  work. . . .  For  a  period  of  years  he  did 
newspaper  work  in  Chicago.  He  was  a  reporter  for  the  Chicago  Times,  and  later  a  reporter 
for  the  Chicago  Tribune.  During  all  these  years  he  was  studying  law,  and  was  admitted  to 
the  bar  in  Minnesota,  in  Michigan,  and  in  1906  in  Alaska. 

He  came  to  Negaunee,  Michigan  in  1867,  where  he  remained  three  years.  This  section  of 
Michigan  was  comparatively  new  at  this  time.  From  Negaunee  he  went  to  Marquette,  Mich, 
in  1870  where  he  started  a  newspaper,  "The  Mining  Journal.”  This  paper  still  bears  the  name 
some  sixty  years  later.  He  retained  interest  in  this  paper  until  1889. 

Mr.  Swineford  greatly  aided  the  mining  industry  of  the  Lake  Superior  region  in  those 
early  pioneer  days  by  helping  to  enlist  capital  to  carry  on  the  work.  To  this  end  he  issued 
a  “Review  of  the  Copper,  Iron,  Silver,  Salt  [sic]  and  other  Material  Interests  of  the  South 
Shore  of  Lake  Superior”  [Mining  Journal,  1876-1882,  Marquette,  Michigan].  Thousands  of

He  served  one  term  and  one  extra  session  in  the  Michigan  Legislature,  House  of 
Representatives  in  1871-72.  He  represented  the  district  in  which  he  lived.  This  district 
comprised  the  counties  of  Marquette,  Delta,  Menominee,  and  Schoolcraft,  which  was 
about  one-half  the  area  of  the  upper  Peninsula.  From  this  area  mentioned,  four  more 
counties  have  since  been  created:  Iron,  Dickinson,  Luce,  and  Alger.  He  served  as  mayor  of 
Marquette  for  two  terms.  Was  Commissioner  of  Mineral  Statistics  for  Michigan  in  1883. 

He  was  also  agent  for  Keystone  Iron  Co.  In  1885  he  was  appointed  Governor  of  Alaska 
and  sent  to  Sitka  in  September  of  that  year.  He  held  the  governorship  for  four  years  under 
President  Cleveland.  He  remained  in  Alaska  for  ten  years  more  where  he  established 
newspapers,  practiced  law  on  occasions,  and  served  as  Inspector  of  Surveyors  and  Land 
Offices,  under  President  Cleveland’s  second  term.70 

Swineford’s  political  and  newspaper  career  is  described  in  greater  detail  in  an  1888 
Michigan  biography  of  their  state  officers  and  members  of  congress: 

He  came  to  Negaunee,  Michigan  in  1867  and  published  the  Mining  and  Manufacturing 
News,  the  first  paper  at  Negaunee.  He  started  the  Mining  Journal,  at  Marquette,  in  1868, 
and  is  still  part  owner  of  that  paper.  Prior  to  coming  to  Michigan  he  had  published  the  Star, 
at  Albert  Lea,  Minn.;  Banner,  at  La  Crescent,  Minn.;  started  the  first  daily  at  La  Crosse, 

Wisconsin;  published  the  Daily  Enquirer  at  Milwaukee,  in  1860,  and  the  Democratic  Press 
at  Fond  Du  Lac,  in  1864-5-6.  Then,  was  in  the  oil  business  in  Canada,  than  an  express 
messenger,  thence  to  Lake  Superior.  He  was  a  Representative  in  the  legislature  of  1871-2, 
and  was  a  commissioner  to  the  New  Orleans  exposition.71 

Other  than  political  endeavors,  the  importance  of  reporting  the  news  was  a  primary 
force  in  Swineford’s  life  which  is  seen  as  he  ventured  to  his  new  post  as  Governor  of 
Alaska  in  1885.  While  at  Portland,  Oregon,  Swineford  purchased  all  the  necessary  print¬ 
ing  materials  to  start  a  newspaper  and  shipped  them  to  Sitka,  then  the  capitol  of  the  ter¬ 
ritory. 


At  a  meeting  of  citizens  and  officials,  a  publication  company  was  formed  with  a  paid-up 
capital  of  six  hundred  dollars — the  cost  of  the  printing  outfit— and  it  was  then  resolved  to 
publish  a  newspaper  at  Sitka.  In  the  person  of  the  Governor  the  association  had  available 
a  practical  publisher,  printer  and  editor,  whose  reputation  justified  the  belief  that  their 
contemplated  newspaper  would  be  published  in  form,  and  edited,  if  need  be,  with  audacity. 
With  the  aid  of  a  typo  discovered  among  the  marines,  the  Governor  set  up  the  press  in  a 
vacant  Russian  hut,  and  in  due  time  appeared  a  full-fledged  newspaper— The  Alaskan. 

Most  new  enterprises  boast  of  a  specialty,  and  that  of  the  Alaskan  was  of  being  the  most 
westerly,  most  northerly  and  most  remote  publication  on  the  American  continent.  Three  of 
its  four  pages  were  filled  with  solid  matter,  descriptive  of  Alaska,  its  climate,  resources  and 
needs  in  the  way  of  congressional  legislation,  written  by  the  master  hand  of  the  Governor. 
The  remaining  columns  were  diversely  illumined  with  local  paragraphs  contributed  by 
a  minor  official,  whose  service  in  that  direction  was  demanded  by  the  managing  editor, 
notwithstanding  his  genius  had  never  been  thus  directed— "which  will  make  the  newspaper 
interesting,”  said  the  Governor.  2 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Governor  Alfred  Swineford  created  quite  a  stir  when  he  issued  his  1887  annual  report 
condemning  the  character  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  (ACC)  and  its  treatment 
of  Alaska  Natives  in  general.  Swineford  made  his  allegations  against  the  ACC  without 
ever  having  visited  the  Pribilof  Islands.  He  was  subsequently  compelled  by  federal  offi¬ 
cials  to  tour  areas  of  Alaska  and  to  visit  the  Seal  Islands  to  examine  conditions  first  hand.

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


The  government’s  agent,  George  Tingle,  wrote  in  his  1888  annual  report  of  July  31,  1888, 
of  Swineford’s  visit  to  St.  Paul  Island: 

On  the  17th  of  June,  at  noon,  the  United  States  man-of-war  Thetis,  Lieutenant-Commander 
Emory,  arrived  at  this  island  and  anchored,  having  on  board  his  Excellency,  A.P.  Swineford, 
governor  of  Alaska. 

Commander  Emory,  with  a  number  of  his  officers  and  the  governor,  came  on  shore,  and 
were  met  at  the  landing  by  the  Treasury  officials  and  Alaska  Commercial  Company’s  agent, 

Dr.  H.H.  McIntyre,  by  whom  a  cordial  welcome  was  extended  the  distinguished  visitors. 

Every  facility  was  offered  the  governor  to  further  the  object  of  his  visit.  He  was  placed  in 
possession  of  the  fullest  information  from  the  books,  and  by  personal  observation  as  well 
as  inquiry  among  the  natives,  as  to  the  management  of  the  fur-seal  islands.  The  entire 
ship’s  party  was  taken  to  the  rookeries  by  the  Treasury  agent,  as  well  as  upon  the  seal  fields, 
through  the  salt  houses  and  store,  schoolhouse  and  church,  where  the  governor  looked 
into  everything  critically.  He  took  occasion  to  express  himself  as  highly  pleased  with 
the  condition  of  the  natives  and  the  management  of  the  Government’s  interests  and  the 
relation  of  the  lessees  therewith. 

He  was,  indeed,  quite  profuse  in  his  praise  of  the  company’s  care  and  provision  for  the 
natives,  as  well  as  the  correct  methods  of  conducting  the  Government  business.  He 
thought  it  could  not  be  improved  upon. 

The  governor’s  visit  can  have  but  one  result,  as  he  is  a  fair  man,  viz,  to  give  him  the  data 
gained  by  personal  knowledge  on  which  he  will  base  a  report  correcting  many  of  the  errors 
into  which  he  was  led  in  his  last  report,  by  accepting  as  true  the  false  statements  of  a  man 
named  Anderson.73 

The  governor  reiterated  his  condemnation  of  the  ACC  following  his  tour  of  most  of 
the  company’s  stations  in  the  Territory  during  the  summer  of  1888.  However,  he  modified 
his  previous  assumptions  concerning  living  conditions  on  the  Seal  Islands.74 

So  far  as  its  [ACC]  operations  on  the  seal  islands  are  concerned,  it  affords  me  pleasure 
to  be  able  to  report  an  altogether  satisfactory  condition  of  affairs;  one  which  is  wholly 
creditable  at  least  to  the  company.  I  am  perfectly  satisfied  that  the  company  is,  and  has 
been  all  along,  faithfully  complying  with  all  the  terms  and  conditions  of  its  agreement  with 
the  Government;  in  fact,  it  is  doing  even  more  in  the  matter  of  providing  for  the  wants  and 
comfort  of  the  natives  than  its  contract  requires. 

I  found  the  natives  all  comfortably  housed  in  neat  frame  houses,  built  for  them  by  the 
company,  and  which  they  are  permitted  to  occupy  for  no  other  consideration  than  that  the 
premises  shall  be  kept  clean.  There  are  about  sixty  of  these  natives’  houses  in  the  village  of 
St.  Paul,  all  presenting  a  neat,  tidy  exterior,  and,  so  far  as  my  observation  extended,  all  well 
and  cleanly  kept  on  the  inside.  No  offal  or  offensive  refuse  of  any  kind  is  allowed  around 
the  house;  the  streets  are  kept  clean,  and  the  sanitary  regulations  and  conditions  are  better 
than  those  usually  enforced  in  eastern  villages.75 

The  governor  did  not  claim  to  have  found  Utopia  on  the  Seal  Islands,  however. 

the  Government  requires  the  company  to  furnish  the  inhabitants  . . .  with  60  cords  of  fire¬ 
wood  annually,  but  for  some  reason  or  under  some  agreement  coal  is  being  furnished  them 
instead  of  wood,  the  allowance  being  10  pounds  a  day  to  each  house. . . .  This  amount  of 
coal  is,  of  course,  insufficient,  and  the  people  are  compelled  to  buy  enough  fuel  to  make  up 
the  deficiency. . . . 

In  the  event  of  a  renewal  of  the  company’s  lease  or  the  leasing  of  the  islands  to  any  other 
corporation  or  individual,  I  think  a  much  more  liberal  provision  for  a  free  supply  of  fuel  to 
the  natives  should  be  made.76

Biographies  S  ♦  Swineford 


The  British  government  used  comments  by  Governor  Swineford  and  others  to  sus¬ 
tain  its  position  that  the  United  States  government  lacked  proper  institutional  control 
over  the  sealing  industry.  They  cited  excerpts  from  Swineford’s  two  reports  (1887  and 
1888)  to  support  its  position  before  the  Paris  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  in  1893  that  the 
leasing  system  was  detrimental  to  the  Seal  Islands’  Natives  and  to  the  fur-seal  herd  via  the 
practice  ol  land  killing.  The  British  disregarded  the  fact  that  Swineford  had  never  actu¬ 
ally  visited  the  Pribilofs  when  he  issued  his  1887  report,  and  they  ignored  the  governor’s 
retractions  in  the  1888  report.  Britain’s  solicitors  put  forward  in  support  of  their  case  the 
governor’s  authority  as  defined  in  the  May  17,  1884,  An  Act  to  create  a  Civil  Government 
for  Alaska,  Section  5: 

The  Governor  appointed  under  the  provisions  of  this  Act  shall  from  time  to  time  inquire 
into  the  operations  of  the  Alaska  Seal  and  Fur  Company  [Alaska  Commercial  Company], 
and  shall  annually  report  to  Congress  the  result  of  said  inquiries,  and  any  and  all  violations 
by  said  Company  of  the  Agreement  existing  between  the  United  States  and  said  Company.78 

In  developing  their  case,  the  British  also  persisted  with  their  attack  against  the  cred¬ 
ibility  of  the  ACC  and  the  government’s  lack  of  control  over  it. 

Official  Reports  of  the  United  States,  including  Reports  of  the  Governor  of  Alaska,  with 
other  evidence,  show  that  the  lessee  Company  practically  exercised  independent  control 
over  the  whole  western  part  of  the  Territory  of  Alaska.79 

In  an  apparent  attempt  to  underplay  some  of  Governor  Swineford’s  more  positive 
statements  in  1888  regarding  the  ACC,  the  British  included  a  statement  directed  at  the 
logistical  challenges  facing  the  governor.  They  alleged  that  under  such  conditions  he 
could  not  properly  attend  to  his  charge. 

Though  Governor  Swineford  succeeded  in  visiting  the  Pribyloff  Islands  in  1888,  the 
circumstances  are  practically  such  that  it  is  ordinarily  impossible  for  the  Governor  of 
Alaska  to  carry  out  the  above  provision.  The  capital  of  the  territory,  Sitka,  is  situated  at  a 
distance  of  about  1,200  miles  from  Unalaska,  the  nearest  place  of  any  importance  to  the 
Pribyloff  Islands,  which  lie  at  a  further  distance  of  about  200  miles.  There  has  been  no 
regular  means  of  communication  between  Sitka  and  Unalaska  till  1891,  when  a  monthly 
mail  was  for  the  first  time  established  for  a  part  of  the  year.  Thus,  unless  by  means  of  some 
chance  vessel,  it  has  been  necessary  to  send  any  communications  passing  from  Sitka  to 
Unalaska,  or  vice  versa,  by  way  of  San  Francisco,  involving  a  sea  transit  of  some  3,500  miles, 
while  from  San  Francisco  to  Unalaska  there  has  again  never  been  any  regular  mail  service. 

It  has  thus  very  naturally  happened  that  the  whole  of  the  western  part  of  Alaska  has  been 
practically  beyond  the  control  of  the  Governor,  and  that  the  powerful  Company  leasing  the 
Pribyloff  Islands  has  exercised  there  an  almost  independent  sway.80 

After  demonstrating  the  logistical  impracticalities  faced  by  the  governor,  the  British 
case  continued: 

In  his  official  Report  for  1887,  A.P.  Swineford,  Governor  of  Alaska,  writes  as  follows  of  the 
operations  and  power  of  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  which  he  professes  himself 
unable  to  control: 

[Quote  within  a  quote]  While  all  this  and  much  more  is  true  concerning  its  treatment  of  the 
native  people,  instances  are  not  lacking  where  it  has  boycotted  and  driven  away  from  the 
islands  Government  officials  who,  intent  upon  the  honest,  faithful  discharge  of  their  duties, 
have  incurred  the  displeasure  [of]  or  refused  to  do  the  bidding  of  its  Agents  [e.g.  see  Gavitt 
biography].  In  fact  it  possesses  the  power  to  compel  compliance  with  its  every  exaction,  and 


569 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


wherever  it  has  obtained  a  foothold  neither  white  man  nor  native  can  do  more  than  eke  out 
a  miserable  existence,  save  by  its  sufferance .81 

The  British  reported  that  Swineford  persisted  in  his  position  against  any  monopoly 
over  the  resources  in  the  Territory.  “I  can  see  no  good  reason  why  the  present  monop¬ 
oly  of  the  [fur-seal]  business  may  not  be  abolished,”82  the  governor  said — but  he  did  not 
recant  his  findings  that  the  Seal  Islands’  Natives  were  being  properly  treated  overall. 

Nearly  a  century  later,  in  1980,  another  author  would  use  Governor  Swineford’s  1887 
comments  about  the  ACC  to  support  an  argument  that  the  ACC,  and  by  association  the 
federal  government,  had  mistreated  the  Native  population  of  the  Seal  Islands.85  And  just 
as  the  British  argument  failed  to  recognize  Swineford’s  later  retractions,  so  did  the  1980 
argument.84

this  is  apparently  erroneous,  if  we  are  correct  in  our  assumption  that  the  source  Williams  cited

which  made  no  such  claim.  Sims  recounted  several  raids  on  the  island  during  July  1906.  In  his  de¬ 
scription  of  a  raid  on  July  17,  he  states  “the  native  guard  was  directed  to  fire.  This  fire  was  returned 
from  the  deck  of  the  schooner,  but  no  one  of  the  island  guard  was  injured”  (op.  cit.  p.  17).  Also  note 
that  in  1906,  the  Department  of  Commerce  and  Labor  was  in  effect,  and  not  the  Department  of 
Commerce  as  Williams  references.

Tanner,  Zera  Luther  (1835-1906) 

Lieutenant  Commander,  U.S.  Navy 

Cotnmander,  U.S.  Fish  Commission  steamer  Albatross 

Genealogy 

Zera  Luther  Tanner,  born  of  Zera  and  Ruth  E. 
(Foster)  Tanner,  December  5,  1835,  at  Warsaw, 

New  York,  married  Helen  Benedict,  daughter 
of  Charles  B.  and  Sophronia  Betsey  (Matteson) 
Benedict,  November  11,  1884,  at  Attica,  New 
York.  Zera  L.  Tanner  died  in  Washington,  D.C., 
on  December  16,  1906. 1 

Biographical  Sketch 


[Zera  Tanner]  went,  in  1855,  to  England  with  an 
invention  he  had  patented,  when  he  entered  the 
seafaring  business  in  October  of  that  year.  Under 
the  British  government  he  made  voyages  to  Russia, 

China  and  the  South  Sea  Islands.  Returning  to 
America,  beginning  in  1874,  Capt.  Tanner  entered 
the  service  of  the  Pacific  Mail  Steamship  Company 
for  four  years.  Next,  the  Captain  was  employed 
in  superintending  the  construction  of  the  U.S. 
steamer,  Speedwell  going  on  special  services  in 

deep-sea  explorations  under  the  United  States  Commission  of  Fish  and  Fisheries. 


Zera  L.  Tanner.  (Andrew  W.  Young, 
History  of  the  Town  of  Warsaw,  New  York, 
1869,  338.) 


A  second  ship,  the  Fish  Hawk  was  built  under  his  guidance  for  the  same  commission.  Still 
later  he  aided  in  planning  the  Albatross  which  he  commanded,  beginning  in  November 
1882  for  five  years  in  scientific  exploration  of  the  waters  of  the  Atlantic  coast  of  the  United 
States,  British  North  America,  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  and  the  Caribbean  Sea.  In  May  1888, 
starting  from  Washington,  Mr.  Tanner,  after  sailing  via  the  Strait  of  Magellan,  again  set

up  headquarters  in  San  Francisco.  He  explored  the  great  fishing  banks  of  Alaska  and  the 
Bering  Sea,  co-operating  with  the  government  for  the  preservation  of  the  seal.  A  survey  for 
a  cable  between  California  and  Hawaii  was  also  part  of  his  work. 

In  1895,  he  returned  for  special  duty  under  the  United  States  Fish  Commission  in 
Washington,  D.C.,  except  during  the  Spanish-American  War  when  he  was  assigned  for 
duty  in  the  Navy  Department  at  Washington,  San  Francisco  and  Honolulu.2 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Lt.  Commander  Zera  Tanner’s  Bering  Sea  experience  provided  him  with  opportunity  to 
observe  and  comment  on  the  impact  of  pelagic  sealing.  His  deposition  was  given  at  Port 
Townsend,  Washington,  before  Notary  Public  James  G.  Swan  on  May  9,  1892: 

1  am  lieutenant  commander  in  the  U.S.  Navy.  I  have  made  five  cruises  in  Alaskan  waters  in 
command  of  the  Fish  Commission  steamer  Albatross,  now  temporarily  in  the  service  of  the 
United  States  Revenue  Marine  . . .  July  4,  1888  . . .  May  1889  . . .  May  1890  . . .  July  1891  . . . 

March  1892. ...  I  have  been  engaged  in  this  work  nearly  fourteen  years,  during  which  time 
it  has  been  a  part  of  my  duty  to  acquire  information  concerning  the  seal  and  its  life.  This 
has  been  done  not  only  from  personal  experience  and  observations,  but  by  questioning 
practical  men,  such  as  intelligent  mariners,  fishermen,  and  hunters.  Pelagic  sealing  has 
been  a  frequent  subject  of  conversation  and  argument  with  me  since  my  first  northern 
cruise  in  1888,  and  I  have  reached  the  following  conclusions: 

First.  Pelagic  sealing  is  wasteful,  as  a  large  percentage  of  seals  killed  are  lost.  Opinions  on 
that  point,  varying  from  30  to  70  percent. 

Second.  The  sexes  can  not  be  distinguished  in  the  water,  except  old  males,  and  both  sexes 
and  all  sizes  are  killed  indiscriminately. 

Third.  Of  the  seals  killed,  from  60  to  70  percent  are  females,  which  during  their  northerly 
migration  are  heavy  with  young,  slow  of  movement,  and  require  an  extra  amount  of  rest 
and  sleep,  thus  largely  increasing  their  liability  to  successful  attack. 

Fourth.  The  female  killed,  the  death  of  the  unborn  pup  follows,  entailing  a  double  loss. 

Fifth.  Seals  killed  in  Bering  Sea  after  the  birth  of  the  pups  are  largely  mother  seals  and  the 
farther  they  are  found  from  the  islands  the  greater  the  percentage  will  be.  The  reason  for 
this  seeming  paradox  is  very  simple.  The  young  males,  having  no  family  responsibilities 
can  afford  to  hunt  nearer  home,  where  food  can  be  found  if  sufficient  time  is  devoted  to 
the  search.  The  mother  does  not  leave  her  young  except  when  necessity  compels  her  to 
seek  food  for  its  sustenance.  She  can  not  afford  to  waste  time  on  feeding  grounds  already 
occupied  by  younger  and  more  active  feeders;  hence  she  makes  the  best  of  her  way  to 
richer  fields,  farther  away,  gorges  herself  with  food,  then  seeks  rest  and  a  quiet  nap  on  the 
surface.  Under  these  conditions  she  sleeps  soundly,  and  becomes  an  easy  victim  to  the 
watchful  hunter. 

Sixth.  A  double  waste  occurs  when  the  mother  seal  is  killed,  as  the  pup  will  surely  starve 
to  death.  A  mother  seal  will  give  sustenance  to  no  pup  but  her  own.  I  saw  sad  evidences  of 
this  waste  on  St.  Paul  Island  last  season,  where  large  numbers  of  pups  were  lying  about  the 
rookeries,  where  they  had  died  of  starvation. 

Seventh.  The  number  of  seals  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  is  decreasing.  I  saw  positive  proof  of 
this  on  St.  Paul  Island  last  season. 

Eighth.  Pups  can  not  swim  at  birth,  hence  the  female  cannot  give  birth  to  her  young  in 
the  water  without  sacrificing  its  life.  I  have  seen  thousands  of  pups  learning  to  swim  at  the 
rookeries  on  St.  Paul,  and  their  early  efforts  were  quite  as  awkward  as  those  of  a  boy  when 
taking  his  first  dip.  Their  trouble  seems  to  be  to  keep  their  heads  above  water.

Ninth.  The  present  practice  in  pelagic  sealing  is  to  shoot  them  from  a  boat  with  a  shotgun 
and  secure  them  with  a  short-handled  gaff.  If  killed  instantly,  they  are  apt  to  sink,  unless 
picked  up  immediately.  If  wounded,  they  may  be  gaffed  in  their  “flurry.” 

Tenth.  Pelagic  sealing  should  be  suppressed  as  far  as  practicable.  A  protected  zone  around 
the  islands,  extending  100  miles  from  them  would  not  be  effective,  even  if  the  limits  were 
respected. 

Eleventh.  The  preservation  of  the  rookeries,  requires  the  suppression  of  pelagic  sealing,  at 
least  in  Bering  Sea,  and  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  passes.3

of  Omaha,  Nebraska,  and  am  not  and  never  have  been  in  any  way  connected  with  any 
company  engaged  in  the  seal  skin  industry.  In  the  year  1881  I  was  Assistant  Treasury  Agent 
for  the  Seal  Islands.  I  arrived  on  the  islands  in  the  latter  part  of  May  of  that  year,  and  after 
a  week’s  stay  on  St.  Paul  Island,  was  detailed  to  St.  George,  remaining  there  until  the  latter 
part  of  August.  Since  then  I  have  not  been  on  the  islands.5 

According  to  Special  Agent  Harrison  Otis  in  his  1881  annual  report,  Taylor  departed

Temple,  George  H.  (1858-1921) 

Assistant  Agent,  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  St.  Paul  Island,  1880-1882 
Genealogy 

George  Howard  Temple  was  born  on  December  11,  1858,  in  Randolph,  Orange  County, 
Vermont,  to  George  Temple  and  Elizabeth  C.  (McIntyre)  Temple,  sister  to  Hugh  H. 
McIntyre  (see  Hugh  H.  McIntyre  biography).  George  Howard  Temple  married  Flora 
May  Hewitt  on  November  24,  1887,  in  Randolph,  Vermont.  The  couple  had  one  son,  Ray 
Hewitt,  born  January  12,  1892. 

Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

George  Howard  Temple  offered  an  agrarian  view  of  the  land  harvest  of  seals  on  the  Pribilof 
Islands.  Temple  deposed  before  Notary  Public  J.  B.  Eldredge  in  Randolph,  Vermont,  for 
the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  June  13,  1892.  The  following  is  an  excerpt  of  his  deposition. 

I  am  32  years  old;  a  native  of  Vermont,  where  I  now  reside.  I  was  bred  to  the  occupation  of 
farming,  and  am  at  present  a  hardware  merchant  in  my  native  town  of  Randolph. 

From  1880-1882, 1  was  employed  by  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  at  St.  Paul  Island, 

Alaska,  as  assistant  agent. 

A  farmer  on  going  to  the  seal  islands  at  once  notices,  as  I  did,  that  the  term  “seal  hunting,” 
so  called,  conveys  no  idea  of  the  business  of  taking  seals  for  their  skins  as  it  is  there  carried 
on.  It  is  in  no  sense  “hunting,”  the  work  of  bringing  in  for  slaughter  from  their  accustomed 
haunts  and  slaying  such  number  of  killable  seals  from  day  to  day  . . .  being  in  no  way 
different  from  that  pursued  by  the  farmer  in  driving  up  his  farm  herd  and  selecting  and 
killing  such  as  he  sees  fit;  the  only  difference  ...  in  the  case  of  the  seals,  the  pasture  in 
which  they  feed  is  the  broad  ocean.8

Virginia  born  on  November  7,  1921,  St.  Paul  Island.16  Neon  Tetoff  died  August  17,  1932, 
on  St.  Paul  Island.17 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Neon  Tetoff,  a  skilled  woodworker,  served  as  boat  keeper  and  engineer  for  the  gasoline 
launch  on  St.  Paul  Island.  He  went  on  a  deadly  sailing  trip  with  Dr.  Walter  Hahn,  Dr. 
Harry  Chichester,  and  their  wives  on  May  31,  1911  (see  Hahn  and  Chichester  biogra¬ 
phies).  A  sudden  wind  capsized  the  sailboat  in  the  Salt  Lagoon,  casting  all  on  board  into 
the  frigid  water.  Everyone  made  it  ashore,  thanks  in  part  to  the  heroic  efforts  of  Neon 
Tetoff,  but  Hahn  and  Chichester  died  from  exposure. 

Tetoff ’s  work  at  the  gasoline  launch  often  required  him  to  tow  Aleut  fishers  to  shore  if 
the  waters  became  too  rough  for  them  to  row  their  small  skin  boats  in  the  cross-currents. 
Philip  Hatton,  an  agent  on  St.  Paul  Island,  captured  one  such  incident  in  the  agent’s  log¬ 
book  in  August  1913: 

At  4  P.M.  I  went  out  with  Neon  Tetof  [sic]  and  several  natives  to  tow  in  the  fishing  boats 
with  the  gasoline  launch.  We  towed  three  boats  in  from  off  the  east  side,  and  several 
[others]  which  were  off  the  east  side  rowed  in  at  about  6  o’clock.  Eight  or  nine  halibut  and 
several  cod  was  the  day’s  catch. 

At  9  P.M.  a  native  came  into  the  office  and  reported  that  one  of  the  fishing  boats  had  not 
returned.  I  immediately  had  the  gang  turn  out,  sent  two  men  along  the  reef  with  lanterns, 
left  instructions  to  start  a  bon  fire  on  the  hill  at  the  flag-staff  if  the  boat  came  in,  and  made 
preparations  to  go  out  in  the  launch  to  search  for  the  boat.  During  the  usual  delay  in 
getting  the  launch  ready  the  missing  boat  was  sighted  coming  around  the  point  near  the 
village  landing. 

The  four  men,  in  the  boat,  stated  that  as  the  day  was  very  good  they  had  fished  longer  than 
usual  and  had  drifted  down  near  Otter  island  [sic].  When  they  started  to  row  home  at  6 
o’clock  the  tide  was  against  them  and  they  could  not  get  in  before  9:30. ls

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

During  1896- 1 897,  Dr.  D  Arcy  Thompson  served  on  the  Behring  Sea  Fur-Seal  Commission. 
He  traveled  to  the  Pribilof  Islands  to  conduct  his  investigations,  which  resulted  in  a  report 
presented  to  both  Houses  of  Parliament  in  1897.  Excerpts  of  his  introduction  to  the  report 
are  given  below. 

Report  by  Professor  D’Arcy  Thompson  on  his  Mission  to  Behring  Sea  in  1896 

Dated  March  4,  1897. 

My  Lord, 

AFTER,  visiting,  according  to  your  Lordship’s  instructions,  the  Pribyloff  and  Commander 
Islands  for  the  purpose  of  investigating  the  condition  of  the  seal  rookeries  thereon,  I  have 
the  honour  to  submit  the  following  Report:— 26 


581 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


2.  The  main  object  of  my  mission  was  the  collection  of  information  and  statistics  with 
regard  to  the  working  and  effectiveness  of  the  Regulations  for  the  fur-seal  fishery 
prescribed  by  the  Award  of  the  Paris  Arbitration  Tribunal. 

3.  It  was  particularly  enjoined  on  me  to  investigate  the  breeding  rookeries  with  a  view  to 
ascertaining  the  extent  and  causes  of  the  alleged  mortality  of  unweaned  pups. 

4. 1  was  further  instructed  to  inspect  and  estimate  the  number  of  seals  resorting  to  the 
islands,  and  in  particular  to  the  Pribyloff  Islands,  and  to  compare  the  phenomena  that 
I  witnessed  with  the  information  and  statistics  supplied  for  the  season  of  1895  by  the 
American  Agents.  (54th  Congress,  1st  Session,  Sen.  Doc.  137,  Part.  I,  pp.  372,  373.) 

5.  Lastly,  I  was  directed  to  call  upon  the  authorities  in  Washington  and  Ottawa,  and  to 
obtain  there,  and  collect  also  from  persons  connected  with  the  sealing  industry  in  Victoria, 
information  bearing  on  the  business  of  my  mission. 

6.  Mr.  G.E.H.  Barrett-Hamilton  was  associated  with  me  and  placed  under  my  orders,  with 
instructions  to  proceed,  in  the  first  instance,  to  Robben  Island  and  the  Commander  Islands, 
and  to  investigate  those  localities  in  particular.  Mr.  James  Macoun  was  associated  with  me 
as  an  Agent  of  the  Dominion  Government,  and  Mr.  A.  Halkett  was  directed  at  the  same 
time  by  the  same  Government  to  proceed  to  Behring  Sea  on  board  a  sealing-schooner,  and 
to  watch  during  the  summer  the  methods  and  results  of  the  pelagic  industry. 

7. 1  left  England  on  the  23rd  of  May,  and  arrived  in  Washington  on  the  morning  of  the 
30th  of  May.  His  Excellency,  Sir  Julian  Pauncefote,  presented  me  to  Mr.  Olney  and  to  Mr. 

Charles  S.  Hamlin,  Assistant  Secretary  to  the  United  States’  Treasury.  With  the  latter 
gentleman,  who  had  himself  visited  the  Seal  Islands  in  the  summer  of  1894, 1  had  the 
benefit  of  much  conversation,  together  with  the  advantage  of  introductions  to  the  whole 
body  of  naturalists  resident  in  Washington  who  had  given  thought  to  the  matter,  or 
participated  in  the  research.  Among  those  who  did  most  to  entertain  and  enlighten  me 
were  Mr.  J.  Browne  Goode,  of  the  Smithsonian  Institute,  the  news  of  whose  untimely  and 
lamentable  decease  was  to  reach  me  ere  my  return;  Commander  J.J.  Brice,  of  the  Fisheries 
Department;  Mr.  Ridgway,  Assistant  in  the  same  Department;  Dr.  Leonard  Stejneger,  Mr. 

Frederick  True,  and  Mr.  Frederic  Lucas,  of  the  National  Museum,  who  had  all  been,  or  were 
about  to  be,  employed  in  this  particular  inquiry.27 

D’Arcy  continued  his  travel  log  when  he  left  Washington  with  James  Macoun,  repre¬ 
senting  Canada  on  the  commission,  and  traveled  to  Ottawa,  Ontario,  then  on  to  Victoria, 
British  Columbia,  to  board  his  ship  for  the  Seal  Islands: 

9.  In  Victoria  I  associated  and  conversed  with  a  number  of  the  captains  of  sealing 
schooners,  who  were  then  engaged  in  fitting  out  their  vessels  for  the  summer’s  cruise,  and 
especially  with  Captain  Sieward,  of  the  “Dora  Sieward,”  who  had  offered  the  hospitality  of 
his  ship  to  Mr.  A.  Halkett  for  the  summer.  I  became  acquainted  also  with  several  gentlemen 
connected  with  the  industry,  and  particularly  with  Mr.  Joseph  Boscowitz,  a  leading  trader, 
with  large  interests  in  the  sealing  business. 

Admiral  Stephenson,  who  was  at  that  time  leaving  the  station,  and  Admiral  H.  St.  John 
Palliser,  who  was  then  assuming  the  command,  received  me  with  much  kindness  and 
undertook  to  meet  my  requirements  for  conveyance  in  or  from  Behring  Sea  on  board  Her 
Majesty’s  ships. 

I  had  previously  received  information  that  the  United  States’  Government  had  extended 
to  me  an  invitation  to  proceed  to  Behring  Sea  on  board  the  United  States’  ship  Albatross, 
and  I  now  learned  that  an  American  Commission  had  been  appointed  on  the  18th  June 
(since  my  departure  from  Washington)  for  an  identical  investigation.  This  Commission 
was  headed  by  Dr.  David  Starr  Jordan,  President  of  the  Leland  Stanford  University,  Mr. 

Joseph  Murray,  of  Fort  Collins,  Colorado,  formerly  United  States’  Treasury  Agent  at  St. 

Paul  Island,  was  selected  as  Assistant  Commissioner,  and  the  following  gentlemen  from 
the  United  States  National  Museum  and  the  United  States  Fish  Commission  were  detailed

as  associates:  Lieutenant  Commander  Jefferson  F.  Moser,  commanding  the  United  States’ 
Fish  Commission  steamer  “Albatross”;  Dr.  Leonard  Stejneger,  Curator  of  Reptiles,  United 
States’  National  Museum;  Mr.  Frederic  A.  Lucas,  Curator  of  Comparative  Anatomy,  United 
States’  National  Museum;  and  Mr.  Charles  H.  Townsend,  Naturalist  of  the  Albatross.  Mr. 
George  A.  Clark  acted  as  Secretary  to  the  Commission,  and  took  a  very  important  part  in 
its  subsequent  investigations. 

10.  On  the  19th  June  I  departed  from  Victoria  for  Seattle,  in  the  State  of  Washington,  to 
join  the  Albatross’.  On  the  24th  June  I  set  sail  from  Seattle  for  Unalaska  on  board  that 
vessel,  in  company  with  the  American  Commissioners  and  Mr.  Macoun,  Mr.  Barrett- 
Hamilton  being  then  on  his  way  from  San  Francisco  to  Japan,  en  route  for  the  Kurile  Islands 
and  the  Sea  of  Ochotsk  [sic]. 

11.  On  the  3rd  July  we  reached  Unalaska,  and  disembarked  on  the  8th  July  on  the  Island  of 
St.  George.  We  were  here  received  with  great  kindness  by  Mr.  James  Judge,  Resident  Agent 
of  the  United  States’  Treasury,  and  by  Dr.  L.A.  Noyes  and  Captain  Daniel  Webster,  of  the 
North  American  Commercial  Company. 

12.  On  the  12th  July  we  left  the  Island  of  St.  George  and  arrived  on  the  same  day  at  that 
of  St.  Paul,  where  we  were  received  by  Mr.  Joseph  B.  Crowley,  Resident  Agent  of  the 
United  States  Treasury,  by  Mr.  Joseph  B.  Stanley-Brown,  Agent  of  the  North  American 
Commercial  Company,  and  by  Dr.  Otto  H.  Voss  and  Mr.  James  C.  Redpath,  officials  of  the 
Company.  Quarters  were  provided  for  us  in  the  Company’s  house,  a  small  laboratory  and 
a  photographic  room  were  presently  fitted  up  for  our  use  in  an  empty  hut,  and  then  and 
thereafter,  during  the  whole  of  our  stay,  we  experienced  the  greatest  kindness  and  attention 
from  the  above-named  gentlemen  and  from  the  people  of  the  island. 

13.  On  the  15th  July  Her  Majesty’s  ships  “Satellite”  and  “Icarus”  arrived  off  the  island.  On 
the  following  morning  I  embarked  for  the  Commander  Islands  on  board  the  “Satellite,” 
accompanied  by  Dr.  Jordan,  to  whom  Commander  Allen  had  offered  the  hospitality  of  the 
ship.28

Biographies  T  ♦  Thompson 


Both  commissions  remained  on  the  Commander  Islands  until  the  end  of  July. 
Thompson  arrived  back  on  St.  Paul  Island  on  September  1.  He  stayed  one  week  before 
departing  for  London,  where  he  arrived  on  the  31st  of  October,  1896. 

21.  [in  part]  It  deserves  to  be  particularly  recorded  that  on  the  islands  we  enjoyed,  together 
with  the  American  Commissioners,  opportunities  and  privileges  that  had  never  before 
been  accorded  to  any  investigators,  whether  American  or  British;  that  the  utmost  liberty 
of  action  within  the  bounds  of  reason  was  permitted  us;  that,  in  short,  we  were  left  free  to 
see  all  that  was  to  be  seen,  and  to  do  whatsoever  commended  itself  to  our  inclinations  or 
judgment. 

22.  Lastly,  it  behoves  me  to  acknowledge  that  in  the  investigations  presently  to  be  described 
my  own  part  was  that  of  one  among  many,  and  that  the  chief  burden  lay  with  Dr.  Jordan 
and  his  Commission.  On  those  great  and  scattered  rookeries  a  man  working  singly  can  do 
little,  where  a  company  working  in  collusion  can  do  much.  Accordingly  it  was  my  business 
to  co-operate  continually  with  the  Americans,  to  see  what  they  saw,  and  to  participate 

in  what  they  did;  and,  as  an  eye-witness  of  all  that  they  witnessed,  I  desire  to  place  my 
testimony  on  record  that  the  general  success  of  our  expedition,  the  new  knowledge  as  to 
matters  of  fact  that  we  obtained,  and  in  particular  the  censuses  that  we  for  the  first  time 
attempted  and  achieved,  were  one  and  all  the  direct  result  of  Dr.  Jordan’s  counsel  and 
leadership.29 

D’Arcy  Thompson’s  thirty-nine-page  report  covered  the  present  condition  of  the  seal 
rookeries,  the  extent  and  causes  of  the  mortality  of  pup  seals,  the  methods  of  driving  and 
killing  seals,  local  management,  and  statistics  of  the  industry.  After  presenting  the  facts 
collected  he  concluded  that  more  study  was  needed.  Previous  observations  “of  the  herd’s 
immense  decrease  and  the  prophecies  of  its  approaching  extinction,  are  overdrawn  and 
untenable.  But  it  is  my  duty  to  state  to  your  Lordship  that  there  is  still  abundant  need  for 
care  and  for  prudent  measures  of  conservation  in  the  interests  of  all.  A  birth-rate  which 
we  estimate  at  143,000  per  annum  is  not  great  in  comparison  with  the  drain  upon  the 
stock.”30 

Professor  Thompson  returned  the  following  summer  to  the  islands  with  his  assistant, 
Alexander  Rodger,  aboard  the  HMS  Rainbow,  arriving  on  St.  George  Island  on  August 
1,  1897.  He  stayed  on  the  island  for  five  days  and  proceeded  to  St.  Paul  Island,  where  he 
remained  until  August  16.  Members  of  the  American  Commission,  including  Dr.  David 
Starr  Jordan,  were  also  on  the  islands,  repeating  experiments  in  branding  and  erecting  a 
strong  fence  around  the  Salt  Lagoon  to  confine  rejected  male  seals.  “A  Staff  of  American 
engineers  spent  the  whole  summer  upon  the  islands,  making  a  complete  topographical 
survey  with  especial  reference  to  the  outlines  of  the  rookeries.”31 

As  noted  by  Assistant  Treasury  Agent  Thomas  E.  Adams  in  the  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s 
Log  of  May  25,  1897  (pages  130-31): 

The  geodetic  surveying  party  was  landed.  Capt.  Tuttle  and  Dr.  Call  of  the  Bear  called  this 
morning.  The  surveying  party  consists  of;  Wm.  Ward  Duffield,  chief;  Fremont  Morse, 

Geo.  R.  Putnam  and  Geo.  L.  Flower,  assistants;  Henry  J.  Slaken,  Joseph  E.  Freeman,  Wm. 

S.  Broughton,  Chas.  H.  Roesch,  and  Fletcher  G.  Forny,  Edward  P.  Rudolph  and  Gustov 
Bergman,  workmen.  The  purpose  is  to  make  a  minute  survey  of  the  Islands,  and  especially 
the  seal  rookeries  thereon,  and  prepare  maps  in  detail  of  the  same. 

Both  the  U.S.  and  British  commissions  made  a  full  count  of  the  populations  at  each  of 
the  rookeries.  They  listed  their  counts  separately  and  made  comparisons  with  the  popula-

tion  counts  of  the  previous  summer.  Thompson  in  his  Despatch  observed  that  “we  have 
here  and  hitherto  omitted  to  take  into  account  a  factor  that  time  may  show  to  be  of  very 
considerable  importance,  to  wit,  a  tendency  on  the  part  of  the  cows  to  fluctuate  from  year 
to  year  in  their  movements,  and  to  frequent  now  one  and  now  another  rookery.”32  To  sup¬ 
port  his  point,  Thompson  relied  upon  observations  made  by  his  assistant,  James  Macoun. 

The  female  when  she  lands  goes,  if  possible,  to  that  rookery  or  part  of  a  rookery  on  which 
the  greatest  number  of  seals  is  congregated,  so  that  the  seals  might  wholly  disappear  from 
the  small  straggling  rookeries  while  thousands  remained  on  the  larger,  more  compact  ones. 

There  was  never  any  evidence  in  support  of  the  theory  that  young  seals  returned  to  the 
rookeries  upon  which  they  were  born,  nor  even  that  the  females  returned  to  the  rookeries 
upon  which  they  had  been  impregnated  the  previous  year,  though  there  was  a  natural 
presumption  in  favour  of  the  latter  theory.  Observations  in  1897,  however,  show  that  is 
not  the  case.  A  few  female  seals  (nine  in  number,  according  to  Dr.  Jordan,  Report,  1896,  p. 

62)  were  branded  on  North  Rookery,  St.  George  Island,  in  1896.  Two  of  these  were  seen 
in  1897,  one  on  East  Rookery,  St.  George  Island,  the  other  on  Zapadnie  Rookery,  St.  Paul. 

None  were  seen  on  the  rookery  upon  which  they  were  branded.  One  of  two  branded  on 
Lukannon  Rookery  in  1896  was  seen  to  land  there  in  1897  by  Mr.  Clarke,  but  it  was  lost 
sight  of.  So  that  what  data  we  have  goes  to  show  that  female  seals  not  only  do  not  usually 
return  to  the  rookeries  on  which  they  were  the  previous  year,  but  that  sometimes  at  least 
they  go  to  another  island.33 

Thompson  reported  an  important  discovery  made  during  the  summer’s  work  of  1897, 
one  that  could  be  used  by  the  British  government  in  seeking  to  overrule  the  U.S.  position 
that  pelagic  sealing  was  solely  responsible  for  the  decline  in  the  fur-seal  herd. 

During  last  winter  Dr.  Stiles,  a  well-known  American  helminthologist,  reasoning  from 
the  very  high  mortality  of  the  pups  on  sandy  as  compared  with  that  on  the  rocky  areas, 
suggested  to  the  American  Commissioners  that  a  cause  of  the  mortality  might  be  found 
in  a  parasitic  worm  of  the  genus  Uncinaria  ( Dochmius ),  which  passes  a  portion  of  its  life- 
history  in  sand,  and  of  which  one  species  is  known  to  be  a  common  and  fatal  parasite  of 
young  puppy  dogs.  This  fruitful  and  ingenious  suggestion  has  been  found  correct.34 

Professor  Thompson  offered  some  profound  observations  following  his  work  on  the 
Pribilof  Islands. 

I  can  call  to  mind  no  other  animal  whose  numerical  abundance  and  fluctuations  are  [as] 
open  to  observation  as  are  those  of  the  fur  seal.  It  is  the  only  animal  in  the  world  of  whose 
actual  numbers  we  have  something  like  a  definite  idea.  Nevertheless,  my  experience  of  a 
second  year  renders  me  inclined  to  trust  less  confidently  than  before  to  the  accuracy  of  the 
figures  that  even  here  the  most  industrious  observer  can  obtain. 

We  are  forced  again  and  again  to  select  approximate  figures,  and  we  are  apt  afterwards  to 
forget  their  vagueness  and  to  treat  them  as  precise;  and  in  our  summary  of  separate  results, 
extremely  different,  we  are  constrained  to  adopt  averages,  though  we  have  no  knowledge  of 
our  right  to  use  so  simple  an  arithmetic.35 

Despite  his  scientific  predilection,  Thompson  appeared  in  his  concluding  paragraphs 
to  recognize  the  politics  that  sent  him  to  observe  the  northern  fur  seal. 

It  is  safe  to  say  that  the  breeding  herd  has  diminished  by  5  per  cent,  [sic]  since  1896;  we 
may,  I  believe,  reasonably  presume  that  the  decrease  is  somewhat  greater  than  this:  but  I 
don’t  think  we  need  or  ought  to  ascribe  to  the  decrease  a  preciser  figure. 

But  whether  we  confine  ourselves  to  a  diminution  of  5  per  cent,  that,  I  think  has 
indubitably  taken  place,  or  permit  ourselves  to  consider  the  possibility  or  probability  of  the 
diminution  having  been  greater  still,  it  behoves  us  to  remember  that  a  remedy  has  already

been  automatically  applied  in  the  reduction  of  the  pelagic  fleet  to  less  than  one-half  its 
numbers  of  a  year  ago.  The  tendency  is  to  equilibrium.  The  total  pelagic  catch  for  this  year 
is  not  likely  to  exceed  20,000  against  36,000  last  year:  and  it  may  be  that,  with  a  catch  so 
greatly  diminished,  the  point  of  equilibrium  has  been  at  length  attained.5'' 

Professor  Thompson  is  credited  with  brokering  the  deal  that  brought  the  dispute  to 
an  end  at  the  Washington  Conference  in  November  of  1897.  As  a  result  of  his  work  on 
the  Commission,  he  was  made  a  Knight  Commander  of  the  Bath  by  Queen  Victoria  at 
Windsor  on  July  13, 1898.  This  honor  was  followed  in  December  1898  by  his  appointment 
to  the  Fishery  Board  of  Scotland. 


Tingle,  George  Robert  (1836-1903) 

Special  Agent,  U.S.  Treasury  Department,  Seal  Islands,  1885-1889 
Superintendent,  North  American  Commercial  Company,  1890-1892 

Genealogy 

George  Robert  Tingle  was  born  on  March  6, 1836,  in  Norwich,  Muskingum  County,  Ohio, 
to  Joseph  D.  Tingle  and  Catherine  (Thomas)  Tingle.  George  Tingle  was  married  twice, 
first  to  Lelia  Jane  Stephens  (born  1836,  died  September  27,  1862), 3  in  Wheeling,  Virginia 
(later  West  Virginia).  George  and  Lelia  had  three  children:  the  Honorable  Edward  Tingle, 
ex-consul  to  Brunswick,  Germany,  and  subsequently  managing  editor  of  a  Philadelphia 
daily  newspaper;  Lelia;  and  Katie  (Mrs.  Frank  Jones  of  New  York  City).  His  second  mar¬ 
riage,  to  Pink  Robertson,  produced  one  son,  George  Robert  Tingle  Jr.,  who  was  born  in 
Wheeling  on  September  14,  1878.  George  Jr.  became  prominent  in  the  Colorado  Springs, 
Colorado,  mining  industry.  The  senior  Tingle  died  at  the  home  of  his  sister  in  Wichita, 
Kansas,  in  August  1903.38 

Biographical  Sketch 

George  Tingle  Sr.  left  Ohio  for  Wheeling,  Virginia  (now  West  Virginia),  in  1852  and  em¬ 
barked  upon  a  career  in  the  wholesale  dry  goods  business,  starting  as  a  clerk  and  book¬ 
keeper  with  Tallant  &  Delaplain.  He  moved  into  the  wholesale  grocery  business  and 
became  a  member  of  the  firm  Maxwell,  Campbell  &  Tingle,  which  evolved  into  the  firm 
Tingle  and  Isham  in  1870.  In  1876,  he  became  sheriff  of  Wheeling,  and  he  continued  in 
that  position  along  with  various  others  until  his  departure  from  Wheeling  in  1882.  He 
ran  unsuccessfully  for  Congress  in  1880.  His  efforts  led  to  the  establishing  of  the  State 
Fair  Association  of  West  Virginia  by  an  act  of  the  West  Virginia  Legislature  on  February 
18,  1881.  In  June  1882,  he  left  West  Virginia  for  Montana  and  was  elected  and  served  as  a 
Democratic  representative  from  Dawson,  Montana,  from  1884  to  1885.39 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Presumably  as  a  consequence  of  his  congressional  connections,  George  Robert  Tingle  Sr. 
was  appointed  by  President  Grover  Cleveland  in  April  1885  to  serve  as  government  agent 
of  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  islands.  He  arrived  at  St.  Paul  Island  aboard  the  steamer  St.  Paul 


588 


Biographies  T  ♦  Thompson  -  Tingle 


on  May  29,  1885,  with  his  wife,  Pink,  and  two  of  their  children,  Catherine  and  George  Jr. 
Along  with  the  passenger  list,  outgoing  agent  H.  H.  Glidden  wrote  in  the  Agent’s  Log, 
“Being  relieved  from  duty  by  a  change  in  the  politics  of  the  national  administration.  I 
return  to  San  Francisco  by  the  St.  Paul  in  a  few  days.”40  Glidden’s  comment  serves  to  clari¬ 
fy  for  researchers  that  at  least  some  of  the  agents  served  under  presidential  appointment. 
Upon  filling  his  new  position  as  the  government’s  representative  on  the  Pribilof  Islands, 
Tingle  wrote  in  the  Agent’s  Log: 

I  am  the  representative  of  the  Government  upon  those  islands  and  have  three  assistant 
agents.  I  am  required  to  see  that  the  lessees  do  not  violate  the  law  under  their  contract, 
and  I  am  supposed  to  govern  the  natives,  protect  them  and  regulate  them.  Practically 
[speaking]  the  Government  agents  are  the  governors  of  the  islands  in  connection  with  the 
management  of  the  seal  business.41 

He  further  offered: 

The  natives  on  the  islands  of  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  look  upon  the  Treasury  agent  as  their 
friend  and  protector  as  against  the  company  employing  them,  and  to  him  they  appeal  in 
case  of  any  imaginary  or  real  grievance.  He  is  regarded  by  them  as  their  governor  and 
judge.42 

Tingle’s  tenure  was  marked  by  some  personal  conflicts.  The  most  significant  arose 
from  allegations  by  his  assistant,  Special  Agent  William  Gavitt,  of  misconduct  by  Alaska 
Commercial  Company  (ACC)  employees  under  Tingle’s  watch,  and  from  charges  by 
Tingle’s  successor,  Charles  Goff,  that  the  size  of  the  fur-seal  herd  had  been  grossly  miscal¬ 
culated  (see  Gavitt  and  Goff  biographies). 

Aspects  of  his  personality  and  background,  such  as  being  a  former  sheriff,  likely  gave 
direction  for  his  position  toward  pelagic  sealers. 

Three  marauding  vessels  have  been  sighted  this  season  cruising  around  the  islands  of  St. 

George  and  St.  Paul,  and  have  been  heard  shooting  seals  in  the  water,  but  so  far  have  not 
landed  or  disturbed  any  of  the  rookeries.  The  Treasury  agents  on  both  islands  keep  vigilant 
watch,  but  owing  to  the  long  distance  between  rookeries  it  would  be  entirely  possible  for  a 
vessel  to  land  a  crew  in  small  boats  and  make  a  killing  on  shore,  and  get  away  without  being 
seen.  Captain  Loud  and  myself  have  made  two  trips  by  boat  and  on  foot  to  points  where 
shooting  was  reported  by  the  natives  to  have  been  heard  without  seeing  the  vessels  or  any 
evidence  on  shore  of  their  having  landed.  Mr.  T.J.  Ryan,  assistant  Treasury  agent  at  St. 

George,  watched  a  schooner  off  Zapadnie  rookery,  St.  George,  for  ten  days.  She  remained 
in  sight  most  of  the  time,  and  sent  her  crew  out  in  small  boats  to  shoot  seal  in  the  water, 
but  was  so  far  out  at  sea  that  she  could  not  be  reached  by  open  boat,  the  only  means  Mr. 

Ryan  had  at  his  command  with  which  to  reach  the  pirate. 

The  positive  knowledge  of  these  marauding  vessels’  hovering  around  the  islands,  constantly 
violating  the  law,  brings  me  to  a  matter  briefly  referred  to  in  my  letter  to  the  Department 
June  7,  viz,  the  necessity  for  better  protection  of  seal  life  in  these  waters  adjacent  to  the  seal 
fisheries.  The  Treasury  agents  are  not  provided  with  a  craft  of  any  kind  in  which  to  pursue 
and  board  a  marauder.  We  go  after  them  as  best  we  can,  by  borrowing  a  work  mule,  or 
walk,  or  open  rowboat.43 

Under  the  subheading  “Pirates,”  Tingle  added  a  hypothetical  scenario  to  his  1885 
annual  report  that  could  have  inspired  the  1927  novel  The  Far  Call,  if  author  Edison 
Marshall  had  had  access  to  the  Pribilof  Agent’s  Logs. 

One  Winchester  rifle,  which  I  brought  with  me,  is  the  only  gun  on  the  island,  provided 
with  ammunition,  ready  for  business,  should  occasion  require  it.  It  is  a  matter  of  great 


589 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


astonishment  that  these  islands  have  for  fifteen  years  escaped  a  raid  from  a  crew  of 
desperate  men.  Because  they  have  not  been  so  visited  is  no  argument  in  favor  of  future 
escape.  A  vessel  with  a  crew  of  25  well-armed,  determined  men,  of  less  courage  than  a 
gang  who  would  rob  a  jewelry  store  or  bank  in  New  York  in  daylight,  could  land  here  any 
time  and  “hold  up”  the  dozen  white  men,  unprepared  for  defense,  and  guard  them,  while  5 
armed  men  could  compel  all  the  natives  to  turn  out  and  load  aboard  the  vessel  all  the  seal 
skins  salted  in  the  company’s  salt  houses;  then  go  to  St.  George  Island  and  do  the  same 
thing.  The  pirate,  having  secured  the  whole  of  the  company’s  valuable  catch,  could  sail  off 
to  China.44 

Marshall’s  story,  written  forty  years  later,  was  similar,  but  Tingle’s  “what  if”  account 
was  not  necessarily  the  stuff  of  fiction.  Marauding  pelagic  sealers  did  land  on  the  Pribilof 
Islands  many  times  before  and  after  Tingle’s  tenure. 

The  record  hints  that  Tingle  used  his  agent’s  position  for  personal  gain.  His  1888 
testimony  before  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives  Committee  on  Merchant  Marine 
and  Fisheries  caused  friction  over  the  question  of  whether  pelagic  sealing  or  land-based 
sealing  should  be  stopped  completely,  and  he  challenged  the  allegations  of  misconduct 
brought  that  year  against  ACC  agents  on  St.  George  Island  by  Special  Agent  Gavitt  (see 
William  Gavitt  biography).  In  1889,  Tingle  became  an  employee  of  the  ACC.  During  his 
government  job,  he  had  emphasized  in  his  annual  reports  that  the  seal  herds  were  not 
decreasing  in  number  but  rather  were  increasing.  Such  a  report  would  allow  the  ACC 
to  continue  to  harvest  its  quota  of  100,000  seals  per  annum.  (As  noted  numerous  times 
within  this  volume,  however,  he  was  not  the  only  government  employee  to  be  hired  by  the 
lessee  on  the  islands  after  his  government  service.) 

I  am  happy  to  be  able  to  report  that,  although  late  landing,  the  breeding  rookeries  are 
filled  out  to  the  lines  of  measurement  heretofore  made,  and  some  of  them  much  beyond 
those  lines,  showing  conclusively  that  seal  life  is  not  being  depleted,  but  is  fully  up  to  the 
estimates  given  in  my  report  of  1887.45  [See  Charles  James  Goff  biography.] 

Tingle’s  assertions  that  the  seal  herds  were  healthy  flew  in  the  face  of  the  U.S.  posi¬ 
tion  that  pelagic  sealers,  many  of  whom  were  based  in  Canada,  were  clearly  decimating 
the  herd. 

George  Tingle  who  was  then  a  Special  Agent  of  the  Treasury,  his  report  was  very 
acceptable  to  the  Alaska  Company,  but  it  has  proved  troublesome  to  the  State  Department, 
for  the  British  people  interested  in  poaching  have  repeatedly  thrown  Tingle’s  report  in 
the  face  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  answer  his  suggestions  about  the  importance  of  a 
protective  agreement.46 

Tingle’s  Agent  Logs  provided  numerous  insights  into  conditions  on  the  islands.  The 
following,  if  an  accurate  interpretation,  offers  a  Native’s  perspective  on  personal  health, 
life  and  death. 

The  usual  number  of  deaths  occurred  this  year  [1888],  mostly  the  result  of  imprudent 
exposure.  Although  the  best  medical  treatment  is  furnished  them,  with  medicines  free, 
they  fail  to  give  that  careful  attention  to  nursing  which  is  necessary  to  bring  them  through. 

When  they  are  remonstrated  with  for  exposing  themselves  unnecessarily  in  bad  weather, 
they  generally  reply  in  Russian,  “Never  mind;  to  die  is  good.”  When  once  prepared  for  death 
by  the  priest  of  the  Greek  Church,  they  calmly  and  happily  await  the  end.  No  tears  are 
shed  by  the  relatives  of  the  deceased  and  no  sorrow  is  manifested  in  the  household.  If  it  is 
a  wife,  the  husband,  according  to  their  custom,  makes  the  coffin,  and  if  a  husband,  then  the 
nearest  male  relative  makes  the  coffin.  The  body  in  all  cases  is  taken  to  the  church,  where 


590 


Biographies  T  ♦  Tingle 


the  services  are  held,  at  the  conclusion  of  which  every  man,  woman,  and  child  kisses  the 
corpse  on  the  forehead  and  on  the  left  cheek.  The  body  is  then  carried  to  the  grave  by  the 
relatives  and  buried.  A  few  days  after  the  funeral  a  tea  party  is  given  at  the  house  of  the 
deceased,  and  is  usually  largely  attended,  mostly  by  the  female  portion  of  the  population. 

After  forty  days’  mourning  and  prayer,  the  surviving  wife  or  husband,  as  the  case  may  be,  is 
at  liberty  to  marry  again.47 

Perhaps  it  was  Tingle’s  agitation  over  the  injustices  alleged  by  William  Gavitt,  or  the 
uncertainty  of  the  seal-herd  numbers  proffered  by  Charles  Goff,  or  the  question  of  a  new 
leasing  contract  for  the  Seal  Islands,  or  the  change  in  the  executive  branch  (Benjamin 
Harrison  defeated  President  Cleveland,  who  had  appointed  Tingle) — or  all  those  fac¬ 
tors — but  in  1889  he  took  up  temporary  residence  in  San  Francisco,  resigned  his  position 
as  Treasury  agent  and  joined  the  Alaska  Commercial  Company  as  its  Seal  Islands  agent. 
When  the  ACC  did  not  win  the  new  government  twenty-year  lease,  Tingle  joined  the 
North  American  Commercial  Company  as  its  general  agent  and  superintendent.  He  re¬ 
mained  in  the  position  until  the  start  of  the  Fur-Seal  Arbitration  hearings  in  1892.48

Townsend,  Charles  Haskins  (1859-1944) 

Zoologist  and  Naturalist,  U.S.  Fish  Commission,  1883-1902 
Director,  New  York  Aquarium,  1902-1937 

Genealogy 

Charles  Haskins  Townsend  was  born  in  Parnassus, 
Pennsylvania,  on  September  29,  1859,  to  the 
Reverend  Daniel  W.  Townsend  and  Elizabeth 
(Kier)  Townsend.  Charles  died  on  January  28, 
1944,  in  Coconut  Grove,  Florida.49 

Biographical  Sketch 

In  1883,  Charles  Townsend  was  appointed  by 
Spencer  Baird,  head  of  the  U.S.  Fish  Commission, 
as  Assistant  U.S.  Fish  Commissioner  for  salmon 
propagation  in  California.  His  first  Alaska  experi¬ 
ence  came  in  1885,  when  he  was  assigned  as  natu¬ 
ralist  aboard  the  Revenue  Cutter  Corwin  during 
an  Arctic  expedition.  He  was  then  assigned  to  the 
research  steamer  Albatross  for  the  next  ten  years, 
charting  deep-sea  habitats  in  the  Pacific  Ocean. 
He  was  a  member  of  the  Jordan  Commission  of 
1896-1898,  created  to  investigate  the  condition 
of  the  northern  fur  seal  and  the  effect  of  pelagic  sealing  on  the  seal  population.  Townsend 
then  served  as  Chief  of  Fisheries  with  the  U.S.  Fish  Commission  from  1897  to  1902.  He 
left  government  service  in  1902  to  become  director  of  the  New  York  Aquarium,  where  he 
remained  until  1937.  He  documented  his  findings  in  more  than  one  hundred  publications 
on  fisheries,  the  fur-seal  industry,  deep-sea  exploration,  maps  and  charts,  and  general 
zoology.50 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Charles  Haskins  Townsend  first  arrived  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  1885,  and  he  would 
make  additional  forays  each  year  during  1891-1895. 51  In  1885,  the  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s 
Log  for  June  7  reported,  “Lt.  J.  C.  Cantwell  of  the  Revenue  Cutter  Corwin  was  sent  to 
Otter  Island  today  with  two  sailors,  and  provisions,  to  guard  the  island  during  sealing 
season.  He  was  accompanied  by  Mr.  Chas.  H.  Townsend  of  the  Fish  commission  [sic], 
Washington,  D.C.  who  is  collecting  specimens  of  birds,  sea  lions,  walrus,  and  seals  for  the 
Smithsonian  Institution.”  Relative  to  the  Pribilof  Islands,  Townsend  is  best  recognized  for 
his  work  as  naturalist  on  the  Albatross  during  the  pelagic  sealing  era  of  the  1890s,  which 
included  stints  on  the  Pribilof  Islands.  His  photographs,  marked  with  the  distinctive  ini¬ 
tials  CHT,  are  found  in  many  government  reports  and  historical  books  discussing  the 
effects  of  the  pelagic  sealing  fleets  on  the  northern  fur-seal  population.  Under  the  aegis 
of  the  Fish  Commission,  Townsend  directed  research  on  the  condition  of  seal  rookeries

during  the  years  1893-1895,  and  he  reported  to  the  U.S.  Senate  in  a  graphic  document 
with  accompanying  topographic  maps  and  rookery  photographs.52  The  rookery  photo¬ 
graphs  taken  by  Townsend  and  Norman  Briscoe  Miller  in  1895  were  published  as  a  sepa¬ 
rate  atlas  in  1896  and  later  described  by  Scheffer  et  al.  in  History  of  Scientific  Study  (page 
13)  as  “a  valuable  record  of  seal  distribution  on  the  breeding  grounds  at  a  low  point  in 
herd  size.” 

Charles  Townsend  was  an  avid  birder  and  collected  rare  specimens  for  the  National 
Museum;  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  1894  he  collected  a  specimen  of  the  Asiatic  stint 
( Tringa  damacensis),  which  he  noted  was  “far  off  its  beat.”  In  a  1927  article  in  The  Condor, 
the  journal  of  the  Cooper  Ornithological  Society,  he  told  the  story  of  his  love  of  nature 
and  how  he  became  part  of  the  Fish  Commission.53

Biographical  Sketch 

Frederick  True  received  his  BS  degree  from  the  City  University  of  New  York  in  1878, 
and  after  graduation  served  as  a  clerk  with  the  U.S.  Fish  Commission.  He  was  the 
Commissions  custodian  of  exhibits  at  the  Berlin  Fisheries  Exposition  of  1880.  The  next 
year  he  joined  the  Smithsonian  Institution  staff  as  librarian  and  acting  curator  of  mam¬ 
mals.  He  advanced  in  his  career  to  become  the  first  head  curator  of  the  Department  of 
Biology  at  the  U.S.  National  Museum  (1897-1911).  On  June  1,  1911,  he  was  appointed 
Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Smithsonian  Institution,  a  position  he  held  until  his  death  on 
June  25,  1914.59 

True  studied  both  living  and  fossil  marine  mammals  and  is  best  known  for  his 
contributions  on  mysticetes  and  the  beaked  whales  ...  He  began  his  career  with  the 
U.S.  Fish  Commission,  but  his  job  at  the  Smithsonian  allowed  him  to  work  in  a  close 
realtionship  with  the  two  research  groups.  In  True’s  Exploration  Work  of  the  Smithsonian 
Institution,  1897,  he  repeatedly  emphasizes  Spencer  F.  Baird’s  interest  in  exploration,  and 
how  he  furthered  it  at  the  Smithsonian  Institution.60

Secretary  G.  Brown  Goode  and  Secretary 
S.  P.  Langley  of  the  Smithsonian 
Institution,  dated  May  11  and  May  13, 
1895,  respectively.  True  was  temporar¬ 
ily  relieved  from  the  Smithsonian  and 
detailed  to  the  U.S.  Commission  of  Fish 
and  Fisheries  to  “make  a  comprehensive 
study  of  the  natural  history  of  the  fur  seal 
and  of  the  condition  of  the  seal  rooker¬ 
ies  on  the  Pribilof  Islands,  Alaska.”61

initial  instructions  to  True  in  a  letter  also 


On  the  understanding  that  you  are  willing  to  undertake  on  behalf  of  the  Commission 
during  the  coming  summer  an  investigation  of  the  Pribilof  Islands,  Alaska,  and  the  consent 
thereto  having  been  given  by  the  Director  of  the  U.S.  National  Museum,  you  are  hereby 
appointed  a  temporary  scientific  assistant  of  the  U.S.  Commission  of  Fish  and  Fisheries  at 
a  compensation  of  two  hundred  and  twenty-five  dollars  ($225)  a  month,  commencing  from 
May  16,  1895.  While  engaged  in  the  field  your  expenses  will  be  paid,  upon  the  presentation 
of  proper  vouchers. 

The  U.S.S.  Albatross,  which  will  convey  you  to  the  Pribiloff  Islands,  will  leave  Mare  Island, 
California,  about  the  20th  May,  touching  en  route  at  Port  Townsend,  Washington,  where 
she  should  arrive  about  May  25,  and  at  which  place  you  should  join  her.  Upon  applying  to 
this  office,  transportation  requests  covering  your  railroad  fare  to  and  from  Port  Townsend 
will  be  furnished  you. 

Instructions  as  to  the  duties  expected  of  you  will  be  furnished  by  Mr.  Richard  Rathbun, 

Assistant  in  Charge  of  the  Division  of  Inquiry  respecting  Food  Fishes  of  this  Commission. 

Very  respectfully 
Herbert  A.  Gill 
Acting  Commissioner62 

In  a  memorandum  from  the  U.S.  Commission  of  Fish  and  Fisheries  dated  May  15, 
1895,  True  received  orders  on  how  to  proceed  with  his  investigations,  which  included 
instructions  to  work  with  Charles  Townsend,  naturalist  on  the  Albatross.  Excerpts  from 
the  nine-page  memorandum  follow. 


Memorandum  for  Mr.  F.  W.  True 

The  investigations  on  the  Pribilof  Islands,  as  originally  planned  for  the  summer  of  1895, 
are  discussed  in  the  instructions  to  the  commanding  officer  of  the  steamer  Albatross  under 
the  heading  “Observations  on  the  Pribilof  Islands,”  a  copy  [of]  which  is  furnished  you.  This 
part  of  Captain  Drake’s  instructions  sets  forth  the  principal  subjects  of  direct  practical 


594 


Biographies  T  ♦  True 


importance,  which  it  was  considered  could  be  handled  by  the  regular  staff  of  the  steamer 
Albatross,  but  there  are  many  other  matters,  especially  of  a  more  technical  character,  which 
deserve  attention. 

In  a  recent  letter  to  Captain  Drake  the  instructions  have  been  materially  modified  as 
regards  the  islands.  Mr.  Townsend  will  make  the  photographs  and  delineations  of  the 
rookeries  as  heretofore.  Captain  Drake  has  also  been  informed  that  Mr.  Townsend  had 
best  attend  to  the  matters  included  under  the  headings  "Number  of  seals  on  the  rookeries,” 
and  “Bachelor  and  bull  seals,”  as  they  involve  a  comparison  with  former  years,  but  it  was 
suggested  to  him  that  the  work  could  probably  be  done  to  best  advantage  by  you  and  Mr. 
Townsend  conjointly. . . . 

It  should,  therefore,  be  borne  in  mind  that  conditions  have  changed  greatly  within  a 
comparatively  few  years.  Formerly,  pelagic  sealing  was  confined  chiefly  to  the  North 
Pacific  Ocean,  and  the  killing  on  the  islands  was  extensive.  Now,  but  few  are  killed  on  the 
islands,  and,  judging  by  all  accounts,  the  pelagic  sealing  in  Bering  Sea  is  most  vicious  in  its 
character.  By  measuring  the  amount  of  harm,  if  any,  done  today  by  the  prevailing  method 
of  driving  and  culling,  the  extent  of  damage  caused  in  the  past  by  the  same  agency  may  be 
relatively  estimated. . . . 

Briefly,  the  principal  questions  sought  to  be  explained  by  the  investigations  are  the  extent 
and  character  of  decrease  among  the  seals,  the  causes  thereof,  and  the  best  remedies  to  be 
applied.  The  decrease  is  to  be  measured  separately  for  the  females,  the  breeding  bulls,  and 
the  bachelors.  The  breeding  bulls  are  said  to  be  generally  free  from  the  attacks  of  pelagic 
sealers,  owing  to  the  limited  extent  of  their  movements  in  the  water.  The  bachelors  and 
females  both  come  within  the  range  of  pelagic  sealing  operations,  but  in  Bering  Sea  it  is 
claimed  that  the  majority  of  the  seals  which  move  far  away  from  the  islands,  after  August 
1,  are  females.  If  the  principal  decrease  is  among  the  bachelors,  it  would  appear  as  though 
it  had  been  caused  by  practices  on  the  islands;  if  among  the  females,  or  both  sexes  alike, 
pelagic  sealing  might  be  safely  blamed.  But  in  this  connection  it  should  be  remembered 
that  the  number  of  bachelors  has  always  been  kept  down,  as  this  is  the  category  which 
the  lessees  of  the  islands  are  allowed  to  kill,  and  a  great  reduction  in  their  numbers  has 
not  been  regarded  as  actually  harmful,  so  long  as  the  male  element  was  kept  sufficiently 
strong  to  insure  the  perpetuation  for  the  rookeries.  As  regards  this  latter  subject,  Mr.  Elliott 
considers  that  a  sufficient  quantity  of  males  has  not  been  preserved,  and  this  is  a  very 
important  matter  for  investigation. . . . 

As  to  the  natural  history  work,  I  would  suggest  that  you  first  determine  in  what  direction 
the  most  good  can  be  accomplished.  That  fact  can  readily  be  brought  out  by  a  comparison 
of  the  statements  of  the  different  observers.  You  will  find  the  season  altogether  too  short  to 
study  the  habits  of  the  seals  in  all  particulars,  and  many  of  their  characteristics  may  have 
been  so  well  established  by  previous  investigators  as  to  require  only  slight  attention  from 
yourself. 

It  is  very  desirable  that  you  take  some  account  of  the  practices  and  needs  of  the  islands 
in  addition  to  the  questions  of  driving  and  culling,  as  suggestions  for  the  improvement 
of  affairs  generally  upon  the  islands  will  undoubtedly  be  acceptable  at  the  Treasury 
Department. . . . 

Very  truly  yours, 

Richard  Rathbun63 

Using  earlier  reports  and  photographs  taken  by  previous  investigators,  True  reported 
his  findings,  excerpted  below,  at  the  end  of  his  investigation. 

I  have  no  hesitation  in  affirming  that  the  seals  were  considerably  less  abundant  this  year 
than  last. . . . 

I  regard  the  herds  as  in  a  very  precarious  condition  as  regards  preservation,  and  while  it  is 
obviously  impossible  to  fix  limits  in  such  a  case,  if  the  off-shore  sealing  operations  continue 


595 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


as  at  present  I  should  expect  to  see  the  cows 
practically  exterminated  in  less  than  five  years. . . . 

It  has  been  generally  conceded,  that  the  decrease 
of  the  seals  is  due  to  human  interference,  and  in 
view  of  the  many  known  cases  of  extermination  by 
human  agency,  there  is  no  reason  for  dissent  from 
this  opinion. . . . 

I  may  mention  two  plans,  in  the  nature  of 
indirect  remedies,  which  seem  to  me  worthy  of 
consideration. . . . 

It  appears  to  me  entirely  feasible  to  brand  the  seals 
with  a  property  mark.  If  the  cows  are  to  be  so 
treated,  it  would  be  best  to  place  the  brand  on  the 
back,  where  it  could  be  plainly  seen.  This  would 
also  have  the  effect  of  rendering  the  skins  of  the 
cows  unmarketable,  and  there  would  be  no  object 
in  destroying  them. 

...  in  case  of  the  presence  of  pelagic  sealers  in 
Bering  Sea  next  season,  the  entire  body  of  seals 
might  be  driven  back  from  the  rookeries  and 
retained  in  the  inland  lakes  and  lagoons  for  about 
six  weeks,  or  during  the  period  when  pelagic 
sealing  is  mainly  carried  on  in  that  region.64 

True’s  recommendation  to  brand  seals  was  apparently  accepted.  In  1896,  “The  first 
attempt  to  mark  seals  by  hot-iron  branding  was  conducted  by  [Joseph]  Murray  (a  cattle¬ 
man  from  Colorado)  on  North  Rookery  [St.  George  Island]  in  August  1896.”65

In  addition  to  his  observations  of  fur  seals,  True  made  a  study  of  the  fox  population 
and  also  collected  plants  and  birds  on  the  island.  His  observations  were  logged  in  his  daily

Veniaminov,  Ioann  (Ivan)  (1797—1879) 

Russian  Orthodox  Priest,  Missionary,  Archbishop,  Metropolitan,  Saint 
Resident  at  Unalaska  with  a  mission  church  on  the  Seal  Islands,  1824-1834 

Genealogy  and  Biographical  Sketch 

Bishop  Innokentii  (Innocent)  Veniaminov  was 
born  Ioann1  (Ivan/John)  Evseevich  Popov  on 
August  20,  1797,  to  a  poor  family  headed  by 
Evsei  Popov  at  the  village  of  Aginskoe  in  Siberia. 

Veniaminov ’s  father,  who  worked  as  the  sacristan 
for  the  local  church,  died  when  his  son  was  six. 

Ivan  lived  with  his  uncle,  Dmitrii  Popov,  deacon 
of  the  local  church.  After  the  death  of  his  aunt, 

Ivan  studied  at  the  Irkutsk  Theological  Seminary 
until  he  was  seventeen.2 

In  1814,  the  well-loved  bishop  of  Irkutsk, 

Veniamin  (Benjamin),  died.  The  rector  of  the 
seminary,  seeking  to  perpetuate  the  name,  chose 
his  best  pupil,  young  Ivan  Popov,  to  bear  it;  he 
was  thereafter  know  as  Ioann  (Ivan)  Evseevich 
Veniaminov. 

In  1817,  even  before  he  had  finished  school,  Ivan  married  Ekaterina  Ivanovna  (her  surname 
is  unknown),  the  daughter  of  a  priest.  This  disappointed  his  superiors,  who  had  expected 
to  enroll  him  in  the  Theological  Academy  at  Moscow. . . .  Graduated  from  the  seminary  in 
1820,  he  was  ordained  as  a  priest  in  1821. 

In  1823,  the  Holy  Synod  asked  the  Bishop  of  Irkutsk  to  send  a  priest  to  the  island  of 
Unalashka,  in  far-away  Russian  America.  No  one,  including  Veniaminov,  wished  to  go 
to  that  remote  corner  of  the  empire.  However,  it  so  happened  that  a  promyshlenik,  Ivan 
Kriukov,  after  40  years  in  the  Aleutian  Islands,  had  returned  to  Irkutsk  to  visit  his  family.

of  Moscow.  (Library  of  Congress,  mtfph

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Kriukov’s  relatives’  father  confessor  was  Veniaminov,  whom  Kriukov  soon  came  to  love  and 
admire.  Kriukov  described  the  Aleuts’  hunger  for  Christian  teachings  so  eloquently  that 
Veniaminov  volunteered  for  the  post. 

On  7  May  1823,  Veniaminov  set  out  from  Irkutsk  with  his  aged  mother,  his  wife  Ekaterina, 
his  young  brother  Stefan,  aged  18,  and  a  young  son.3 

In  September  1823,  Fr.  Veniaminov  and  his  family  arrived  at  New  Archangel  (Sitka), 
where  they  remained  until  the  summer  of  1824,  when  they  relocated  to  Unalashka 
(Unalaska).  At  New  Archangel,  Father  Veniaminov  began  to  learn  the  rudiments  of  the 
Aleut  language  (Unangam  Tunuu)  and  from  here  he  “was  destined  to  become  one  of  the 
great  luminaries  of  Russian  America.  Possessing  remarkable  intellectual,  linguistic,  and 
practical  skills.”4 

After  settling  in  Unalaska  in  the  summer  of  1824, 

he  built  a  church  and  a  school  and  began  his  lifelong  task  of  studying  the  native  languages 
of  the  region.  With  the  help  of  the  Aleut  chief  Ivan  Pan’kov,  Veniaminov  invented  an 
alphabet  for  the  Unangan  language  and  then  used  it  to  compose  grammars  and  translate 
the  Gospel  of  St.  Matthew.5 

Renowned  linguist  Richard  Geoghegan  further  credits  Veniaminov ’s  achievement  of 
bringing  the  spoken  Aleut  language  to  written  form.  [Veniaminov]  “selected  appropriate 
characters  of  the  Cyrillic  alphabet  to  represent  Aleut  speech  sounds,  recorded  the  main 
body  of  Aleut  vocabulary  and  formulated  grammatical  rules.”6

Aleut  Primer  by  Reverend  Ioann  Veniaminov,  1845,  pages  1-2.  (Library  of  Congress,  mtfph  c0018.) 


604 


Biographies  V  ♦  Veniaminov 


Fr.  Veniaminov’s  accomplishment  did  not  happen  overnight.  His  effort  began  in 
earnest  nearly  two  years  after  moving  to  Unalaska,  but  not  until  1846  did  then-Bish- 
op  Veniaminov  publish  Opyt  Grammatiki  Aleutsko-Lisjevskago  Jazyka  (Essay  Toward  a 
Grammar  of  the  Fox  Island  Aleutian  Language),  “the  first  tentative  grammar  and  vo¬ 
cabulary  of  Eastern  Aleut.”  During  the  intervening  period,  Fr.  Veniaminov  endeavored  to 
make  vocational  use  of  his  efforts. 

In  April  1832  Veniaminov  took  into  his  service  the  Aleut  translator  Semyon  Pan’kov, 
probably  the  son  of  Ivan  Pan’kov,  who  helped  him  [in]  revising  the  translation  of  The 
Gospel  according  to  St.  Matthew  . .  ,8 

The  main  purpose  of  this  literary  activity  was  of  course  the  teaching  of  the  Gospel  rather 
than  the  preservation  of  the  Aleut  language.  The  meanings  of  the  Aleut  words  were 
sometimes  altered  more  or  less  to  fit  the  Russian  originals,  and  important  elements  of  the 
ancient  Aleut  culture,  such  as  the  kinship  terminology,  were  not  properly  recorded.9 

However,  Fr.  Veniaminov’s  personal  ambitions  drove  him  beyond  his  focus  on  written 
words  for  religious  applications.  Veniaminov,  either  knowingly  or  unknowingly,  strove  to 
preserve  the  oral  traditions  of  the  Unangan/Unangas  culture. 

The  first  specimens  of  original  Aleut  traditions,  in  Aleut,  were  collected  in  the  1830s  and 
published  by  Veniaminov  in  the  1840s.  They  comprised  twelve  Eastern  Aleut  song  texts, 

“collected,  written  down  and  translated  by  the  Unalaska  interpreter,  the  Aleut  Semyon 
Pan’kov,”  and  an  Atkan  song  text  and  two  short  Atkan  tales  collected  by  his  “Creole” 
colleague  of  Atka,  Iakov  Netsvetov.10 

Veniaminov’s  travels  throughout  the  Aleutian  Islands  in  a  baidarka11  and  larger  craft 
collecting  ethnographic  and  natural  science  material  resulted  in  other  publications  in 
the  Aleut  and  Tlingit  (Kolosh)  languages,  as  well  as  his  historically  important  Zapiski  ob 
ostrovakh  Unalashkinskago  otdeyla  ( Notes  on  the  Islands  of  the  Unalashka  District),  pub¬ 
lished  in  Russian  in  1840.  Natural  scientist  William  H.  Dali  credited  Veniaminov  for  being 
the  first  to  record  weather  conditions  in  Alaska.12  Veniaminov’s  academic  credentials,  his 
love  of  Russian  America,  and  the  Natives’  love  of  him  propelled  Fr.  Veniaminov  to  higher 
ecclesiastical  levels. 

Ivan  Veniaminov  served  as  Russian  Orthodox  priest  at  Unalaska  during  1824-34.  In 
1827,  or  nearly  three  years  after  settling  in  at  Unalaska, 

Veniaminov  made  his  first  pastoral  call  at  the  Pribylov  Islands.  He  praised  the  islanders 
as  industrious,  devout  and  intelligent.  The  islands’  creole  manager  Kas’ian  Shaiashnikov 
became  a  friend  and  supplied  details  about  fur-seal  management,  which  Veniaminov  later 
included  in  his  book  on  the  Unalaska  district.13 

Subsequently,  he  served  as  archpriest  at  Sitka  from  1834  to  1838. 14 

While  on  a  trip  to  St.  Petersburg  in  1839  to  plead  for  support  of  the  church  in  Alaska,  he 
learned  of  his  wife’s  death.  At  first  reluctant  to  return  to  America,  Veniaminov  in  1840 
was  made  bishop  of  the  newly  created  diocese  of  Kamchatka,  the  Kuril  Islands,  and  the 
Aleutians,  which  he  administered  from  New  Archangel,  and  [was] given  the  monastic  name 
Innokentii  [Innocent].  Revered  as  a  religious  leader  throughout]  Russia,  Innokentii  was 
elected  metropolitan  of  Moscow  in  1868.  From  there  he  supervised  the  Russian  Imperial 
Missionary  Society,  which  continued  its  work  in  Alaska  until  the  1917  Revolution.  In  1977 
Innokentii  was  proclaimed  a  saint  by  the  Orthodox  Church  in  America.15 


605 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Historians  recognize  Veniaminov  for  his  important  Notes,  which  includes  the  first 
historical  account  of  the  Seal  Islands.  Notes  was  originally  published  at  St.  Petersburg, 
Russia  in  three  volumes.16  In  1896,  self-proclaimed  expert  on  Alaska,  Henry  Wood  Elliott, 
praised  Veniaminov ’s  Notes: 

This  work  of  Bishop  Innocent  Veniaminov  is  the  only  one  which  the  Russians  can  lay 
claim  to  as  exhibiting  anything  like  a  history  of  western  Alaska,  or  of  giving  a  sketch 
of  its  inhabitants  and  resources  that  has  the  least  merit  of  truth  or  the  faintest  stamp 
of  reality.  Without  it  we  should  be  simply  in  the  dark  as  to  much  of  what  the  Russians 
were  about  during  the  whole  period  of  their  occupation  and  possession  of  that  country. 

He  served,  chiefly  as  a  priest  and  missionary,  for  twenty-five  years,  from  1814-1839,  at 
Unalaska,  having  the  seal  islands  in  his  parish,  and  was  made  bishop  of  all  Alaska.  He 
was  soon  after  recalled  to  Russia,  where  he  became  the  primate  of  the  national  church, 
ranking  second  to  no  man  in  the  Empire,  save  the  Czar.  He  must  have  been  a  man  of  fine 
personal  appearance,  judging  from  the  following  description  of  him  noted  by  Sir  George 
Simpson,  who  met  him  at  Sitka  in  1842,  just  as  he  was  about  to  embark  for  Russia:  “His 
appearance,  to  which  I  have  already  alluded,  impresses  a  stranger  with  something  of  awe, 
while  in  further  intercourse,  the  gentleness  which  characterizes  his  every  work  and  deed 
insensibly  molds  reverence  with  love;  and,  at  the  same  time,  his  talents  and  attainments 
are  such  as  to  be  worthy  of  his  exalted  station.  With  all  this,  the  bishop  is  sufficiently  a  man 
of  the  world  to  disdain  anything  like  cant.  His  conversation,  on  the  contrary,  teems  with 
amusement  and  instruction,  and  his  company  is  much  prized  by  all  who  have  the  honor  of 
his  acquaintance.”  Such  is  the  portrait  drawn  of  him  by  Governor  Simpson  of  the  Hudson 
Bay  Company.17 

Linguist  Richard  Geoghegan  initiated  a  translation  of  Veniaminnov’s  Notes  into 
English,  which  Dr.  Lydia  Black  completed  and  published  in  1984.  It  remains  an  authority 
on  extant  cultural  and  natural  history  conditions  during  the  early  contact  period  in  the 
Aleutians  and  Pribilof  Islands. 


Volkov,  Phillip  (1820-ciRCA  1887) 

Resident,  St.  Paul  Island 

Phillip  Volkov  was  apparently  well  respected  by  the  Amerikansk  (white  Americans) 
on  St.  Paul  Island.  The  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s  Log  for  November  26,  1875,  offered  the  fol¬ 
lowing  commentary  regarding  Volkov’s  fifty-fifth  birthday  (name  day)  celebration: 

Today  being  faithful  Philip  Volcoff’s  namesday  (55  years  past)  we  were  invited  to  his  home 
at  V2  past  eleven  a.m.  where  we  were  treated  in  a  substantial  manner  to  three  courses  of 
good  food  and  two  of  good  drink  the  last  being  chi  (tea).  The  following  filled  the  table:  C.  P. 

Fish,  Hamden  McIntyre,  B.  G.  McIntyre,  Dr.  D.  R.  Meany,  George  Marston.18 

Seal  Islands  expert  Henry  Wood  Elliott  introduced  the  following  quote  from  Phillip 
Volkov  as  “the  view  expressed  to  the  writer  by  one  of  the  oldest  and  most  intelligent  of 
the  people.” 

I  do  not  have  any  objection  to  the  attendance  of  my  children,  nor  have  my  neighbors  to  that 
of  theirs,  on  your  (English)  school;  but  if  our  boys  and  young  men  neglect  their  Russian 
lessons,  who  is  going  to  take  our  places  when  we  die,  in  our  church,  at  our  christenings, 
and  at  our  burials?19 

The  St.  Paul  Island  census  for  1887  recorded  Philip  Volkov  as  having  passed  away.20

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

St.  Paul  Island  Treasury  Agent-in-Charge  Joseph  Murray  recounted  the  horrific  acciden¬ 
tal  death  of  Dr.  Voss: 


Thursday,  August  26,  1897 

It  becomes  my  painful  duty  to  record  the  death  of  Dr.  Otto  Voss — the  saddest  event  that 
has  ever  taken  place  on  the  Seal  Islands!  Full  of  animation,  energy  and  enthusiasm,  he  was 
snatched  out  of  existence  so  suddenly  that  I  can  scarcely  realize  the  fact  that  he  was  talking 
to  me,  so  joyously,  only  four  short  hours  ago! 

We  had  been  together  nearly  all  the  day,  planning  alterations  and  improvements, 
and  directing  the  native  men  how  to  make  them;  we  left  the  Office  of  the  Company, 
accompanied  by  the  Carpenter,  Aggie  Kushin,  to  whom  Dr.  Voss  had  been  showing  the 
plan  for  a  new  stairs;  and  for  whom  he  now  proposed  to  walk  down  to  the  lumber  pile,  at 
the  Point  Warehouse  to  pick  out  the  necessary  lumber  for  the  stairs. 

While  the  long  2x12  planks  were  being  loaded  the  doctor  stepped  into  the  wagon  to  assist 
in  raising  the  end  of  the  plank  to  the  top  of  the  dash-board,  and  two  planks  were  thus 
loaded  when  the  mules  took  fright  and  ran  away. 

They  followed  the  train  road  running  along  before  the  first  row  of  native’s  dwellings,  and,  as 
the  wagon  ascended  the  rising  ground,  the  two  planks  slipped  out,  and  off,  and  fell  on  the 
ground.  As  soon  as  the  planks  disappeared  from  the  mules  view  they  slowed  down  to  an 
ordinarily  slow  trot  and  it  appeared  the  trouble  was  at  an  end;  but  suddenly,  the  doctor  was 
seen  to  step  out  over  the  dash  board,  and  out  on  to  the  wagon  tongue,  in  order  to  recover 
one  of  the  lines  which  had  been  broken,  when,  just  as  suddenly,  the  team  appeared  to  take 
another  fright,  for  they  turned  and  dashed  off  the  road  and  ran  down  the  incline  at  a  terrific 
speed.  For  a  moment  the  doctor  was  seen  running  on  the  ground,  but  between  the  wagon 
and  the  team,  and  inside  the  double-trees;  and  there  he  fell  where  we  found  him.21

During  the  spring  and  fall  of  1843  and  in  August  of  1844,  Il’la  Voznesenskii  visited 
the  Pribilof  Islands,  where  he  made  observations  and  illustrations  of  the  St.  Paul  and 
St.  George  village  settings.  The  drawings  were  done  in  both  pencil  and  India  ink.22

Writer,  Journalist  and  Newspaper  Editor 
Genealogy 

George  W.  Wardman  was  born  April  8,  1838,  at  Buffalo,  Erie  County,  New  York,  the  son 
of  William  Wardman  from  Yorkshire,  England,  and  Jane  (Martin)  Wardman,  a  native  of 
Dublin,  Ireland.  George’s  parents  married  in  Canada  and  immigrated  to  Buffalo,  where 
their  four  children  were  born.  George  was  the  eldest;  the  others  were  Edward  Jacob 
Wardman,  born  March  24,  1844;  Henry  Benjamin  Wardman,  born  August  12,  1846;  and 
Jane  Wardman,  born  July  1848.  William  Wardman  died  in  1848  at  Buffalo,  and  his  widow, 
Jane  Wardman,  married  Thomas  O’Brian,  born  about  1828  in  Ireland.  Widowed  again, 
Jane  (Martin)  Wardman  O’Brian  passed  away  in  Buffalo  on  April  12,  1882. 

George  W.  Wardman  was  married  on  September  29,  1865,  at  Idaho  City,  Territory  of 
Idaho,  to  Mary  Virginia  Ervin,  born  at  New  Orleans,  Louisiana,  January  22,  1854.  She  was 
the  daughter  of  William  C.  Ervin  and  Catherine  (maiden  name  not  found)  Ervin,  both 
Pennsylvania  natives.  George  and  Mary  had  two  sons,  John  Ervin  and  George  Benjamin. 
The  U.S.  Census  of  1870  in  South  Pass  City,  Wyoming  listed  John  E.  Wardman,  but  as  an 
adult  he  went  through  life  known  as  “Ervin.” 

The  older  son,  John  Ervin  Wardman,  was  born  December  25,  1865,  at  Salt  Lake  City, 
Utah,  and  died  Jan.  13,  1923,  at  White  Plains,  New  York.  Ervin  was  married  twice  in 
New  York  City,  first  to  Caroline  Klink  Eyre  on  May  14,  1902,  and  after  Caroline’s  death 
in  1908  to  Violet  Boyer  of  Barrie,  Ontario,  Canada,  on  February  8,  1910.  Ervin  and  Violet 
had  one  son,  George  Ervin  Wardman,  who  married  Elfrida  L.  Smith,  daughter  of  Alfred

Younger  son  George  Benjamin  Wardman 
was  born  April  21,  1869,  at  Cheyenne,  Wyoming. 
He  was  married  in  California  on  June  1,  1898, 
to  Emily  Alice  Wringrose,  born  June  24,  1873, 
at  Northampton,  England.  George  B.  Wardman 
died  January  2,  1951,  in  Los  Angeles,  California. 

George  W.  Wardman  died  of  tuberculosis  at 
Monrovia,  Los  Angeles  County,  California,  on 
April  22,  1914,  and  was  interred  at  San  Gabriel, 
California,  on  April  24,  1914.1 

Biographical  Sketch 

George  W.  Wardman  lived  as  a  youngster  in  the 
Black  Rock  District  of  Buffalo,  New  York,  just  off 
the  Niagara  River.  An  1862  gold  strike  at  Idaho 
City  was  reputed  to  have  delivered  250  mil¬ 
lion  dollars  in  gold — more  than  either  the  1849 
California  or  the  1898  Klondike  gold  strikes.2  As 
gold  fever  struck  thousands  of  people  and  rail¬ 
roads  expanded  west,  Wardman  set  out  to  seek  a  share  of  the  nation’s  newly  discovered 
wealth.  First,  he  ventured  to  Idaho  City  in  the  Boise  basin  of  Idaho,  where  he  married 
Mary  Ervin  in  1865.  The  couple  moved  to  Salt  Lake  City  the  same  year.  In  1868,  they 
moved  to  Cheyenne,  Wyoming,  where  his  brother,  Henry  B.  Wardman,  a  tinsmith,  joined 
him.3  In  Cheyenne,  George  W.  Wardman  worked  as  a  journalist  and  associate  editor  for 
the  Cheyenne  Daily  Leader .4 

Large  gold  deposits  had  been  struck  at  South  Pass  City,  Wyoming,  in  1867. 

Gold  seekers  settled  on  Willow  Creek  in  1867.  The  camp  soon  became  a  town,  and  the 
town  became  the  largest  in  the  state.  Named  South  Pass  City,  it  grew  quickly.  Within 
eighteen  months,  its  population  exceeded  two  thousand.  What  should  have  been  a  curly- 
haired,  short-tempered  saloon  town  became,  instead,  a  family  community.  Those  miners 
with  wives  and  children,  seeking  a  safe  home,  chose  this  town  rather  than  Atlantic  City, 
located  five  miles  east.  The  women  were  quick  to  organize  and  preserve  this  precious 
quality.  Some  say  organization  was  hastened  by  the  several  long  meetings  held  during  the 
Indian  raids.  Hostiles  frequently  threatened  the  town,  driving  off  the  stock  and  stealing 
whatever  was  unguarded.  During  the  raids,  the  women  and  children  were  locked  in  a  cave¬ 
like  recess  behind  the  wine  celler  [sic  passim]  owned  by  a  local  merchant.  The  celler  was 
protected  by  a  stout  iron  door.  Many  a  decision  was  made  in  the  darkness  of  this  hideaway.5 

In  April  1869,  George  and  Henry  moved  to  South  Pass  City  and  that  fall,  on  October 
4,  the  brothers  became  claim  holders  in  the  “South  Pass  City  Lode.”6  They  also  opened  a 
hardware  store  specializing  in  tin  ware.7

George  W.  Wardman’s  father-in-law, 
William  C.  Ervin,  was  a  hardware  mer¬ 
chant  who  had  ventured  west  from  New 
Orleans  after  his  daughter,  Mary  Virginia, 
was  born.  William  Ervin  settled  first  in 
California,  where  the  1860  U.S.  Census 
recorded  him  operating  his  first  hard¬ 
ware  store  in  Los  Angeles.  He  then  sold 
wares  and  groceries  to  miners  in  the  new 
Wyoming  Territory,  first  in  Cheyenne, 
next  Bryan,  and  then  at  South  Pass  City, 
where  in  1868  he  built  the  Idaho  House 
Hotel.  In  1869,  he  renamed  it  the  South 
Pass  Hotel.8 

In  1869,  Democrat  George  Wardman, 
by  then  a  well-recognized  journalist,  was 
elected  as  the  representative  of  Carter 
County  (later  renamed  Sweetwater)  to

Once  the  gold  fever  died,  Wardman  left  the  West  for  the  steel-producing  city  of 
Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania,  where  he  established  himself  as  a  newspaper  man.  The  Pittsburgh 
City  Directories  listed  him  in  1876  as  a  resident  of  that  city  and  editor  of  the  Evening 
Leader,  in  1877-90,  as  editor  of  the  Dispatch,  and  in  1890-97,  editor  of  the  Pittsburgh 
Press.10  In  1879,  Wardman  traveled  to  Alaska  as  a  journalist.  During  the  period  1881-85, 
he  was  assistant  agent  for  the  Department  of  the  Treasury  on  St.  George  Island;  afterward 
he  went  back  to  Pittsburgh.  In  1898,  Wardman  sold  his  holdings  in  the  Pittsburgh  Press 
and  returned  to  the  West  as  a  writer,  settling  in  Eddy,  New  Mexico.11  Within  the  next 
decade,  he  moved  to  California  to  live  closer  to  his  son  George  Benjamin,  of  San  Marino, 
California.12  He  spent  his  final  days  in  the  San  Gabriel  Valley  at  Monrovia,  California, 
where  he  died  in  1914.13 


Besides  working  as  a  news  editor,  Wardman  published  A  Trip  to  Alaska:  A  Narrative, 
“Folk-Lore  Scrap-Book,”  in  Journal  of  American  Folklore,  and  “The  Fuel  of  the  Future,”  in 
Scientific  American  Supplement. 

Wardman’s  son  John  Ervin  followed  in  his  father’s  footsteps  and  became  a  journal¬ 
ist.  He  was  educated  at  Phillips  Exeter  Academy,  Exeter,  New  Hampshire,  and  gradu¬ 
ated  from  Harvard  University  with  an  AB  degree  in  1888.  John  Ervin,  more  commonly 
known  as  Ervin,  worked  as  a  writer  in  New  York  City,  then  began  as  staff  editor  and

York  Press,  1895-1916;  editor  at  the  New  York  Herald,  1920-1923;  and  finally  publisher 
of  the  Sun-Herald,  1920-1923.  Ervin  Wardman  fathered  the  phrase  “yellow  journalism” 
in  1897  with  his  attacks  against  news  publishers  William  Randolph  Hearst  and  Joseph 
Pulitzer,14  whom  Ervin  alleged  resorted  to  sensationalism  to  attract  readers.15  John  Ervin

Wardman’s  son,  George  Ervin  Wardman,  settled  in  Bermuda,  where  he  acquired  real 
estate  including  elegant  hotels;  Ervin’s  grandson,  George  Alfred  Wardman,  continues  to 
operate  those  establishments. 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Assistant  Agent  George  Wardman  (1881-1885)  preceded  Assistant  Agent  William  Gavitt 
(1887-1888)  on  St.  George  Island  by  two  years.  Nonetheless,  when  the  Congressional 
Committee  on  Merchant  Marine  and  Fisheries  convened  an  investigation  of  the  Seal 
Islands  in  1888,  it  called  Wardman  to  testify  as  to  his  knowledge  of  the  character  of  Alaska 
Commercial  Company  agents  accused  by  Agent  Gavitt  of  improprieties  against  Natives 
and  non-Natives  during  Gavitt ’s  tenure  on  the  island  (see  William  Gavitt  biography).  A 
New  York  Times  article  presented  Wardman’s  position: 

George  Wardman,  who  was  a  special  agent  at  the  island  of  St.  George  from  1881  to  1884 
[should  have  stated  1885]  said  he  never  knew  a  woman  or  a  girl  upon  the  island  that  was 
assaulted,  or  a  man  or  a  boy  to  be  abused  by  any  of  the  company’s  agents;  nor  did  he 
ever  know  of  a  native  woman  living  in  the  company’s  house  with  one  of  the  employees. 

Regarding  Webster,  [the]  witness  said  he  was  a  querulous,  dyspeptic  old  man,  with  whom 
he  had  had  one  minor  difficulty.  He  never  saw  anything  which  would  lead  him  to  believe 
that  the  company’s  house  was  converted  into  a  house  of  ill  repute.16 

George  Wardman  wrote  of  his  impressions  of  the  Pribilof  Islands  in  an  article,  “The 
Seal  Islands  of  Alaska,”  published  in  The  Overland  Monthly  in  1883, 17  and  the  next  year  in 
his  book  A  Trip  to  Alaska  about  his  1879  trip,  excerpted  here. 

In  the  summer  of  1879,  the  writer  obtained  permission  from  Hon.  John  Sherman,  at 
that  time  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  to  proceed  in  the  United  States  revenue  steamer 
“Richard  Rush,”  captain  [sic]  Bailey,  on  her  cruise  from  San  Francisco  to  Sitka,  the  Fur  Seal 
Islands,  the  Sea  Otter  Grounds,  and  other  points  in  Alaskan  waters.  The  voyage  proved 
exceedingly  interesting,  and  the  author  gave  an  account  of  what  he  saw  and  heard  to  certain 
newspapers,  in  a  desultory  way,  but  he  has  been  led  to  believe  that  his  observations  may  be 
read  in  a  more  permanent  form  with  interest,  and  he  hopes  with  profit,  by  those  who  may 
be  in  search  of  information  concerning  Alaska.18 

The  natives  of  St.  Paul’s  and  St.  George’s  Islands  live  in  a  sort  of  communistic  state,  and  are, 
withal,  purse-proud  aristocrats.  They  perform  a  few  days’  labor  for  the  company  outside 
of  seal-taking,  for  which  they  are  paid  at  the  rate  of  ten  cents  per  hour.  All  earnings  for 
killing  seals  are  distributed  pro  rata  in  classes,  not  only  to  those  who  work  according  to 
their  ability,  but  to  some  who  are  unable  to  perform  any  labor.  They  are  not  frugal  in  their 
habits.  They  spend  the  greater  part  of  their  money  on  luxuries.  Having  house  rent,  fuel, 
fish  and  seal  meat,  doctor  and  school-master  free,  they  look  around  for  something  to  buy. 

For  the  one  hundred  and  twenty  women  on  one  island  the  company  carried  up  a  hundred 
dozen  fine  silk  handkerchiefs,  which  are  generally  worn  on  the  head,  a  hundred  dozen 
fine  worsted  colored  stockings,  almost  as  many  scarfs  [sic]  and  nubias  [sic],  dozens  of  fine 
shawls,  one  thousand  two  hundred  yards  of  calico  (some  of  these  seal-killers’  wives  have  a 
dozen  dresses  at  a  time),  three  hundred  yards  of  other  dress  goods  and  flannels,  with  three 
suits  of  clothing,  boots,  and  caps  for  every  man  and  boy  in  the  village,  and  good  cassimere 
[sic]  clothing  is  the  kind  they  demand. 

For  food  supplies  on  one  island  they  have  thirty-five  thousand  pounds  of  biscuit  and 
crackers  and  two  hundred  and  thirty  barrels  of  flour;  seventy  chests  of  tea,  fifty-two  pounds 
each;  four  hundred  boxes  candles,  stearine  [sic]  and  paraffine;  one  thousand  sacks  of  rice, 
fifty  pounds  each;  one  thousand  gallons  kerosene,  etc.

A  few  years  ago  these  same  natives  lived  in  barabaras  (sod  huts),  twenty-five  to  forty 
persons  in  one  room.  They  used  blubber  for  lights  and  fuel  till  the  lampblack  hung  in 
strings  from  the  ceiling.  Now  they  have  frame  houses,  cook-stoves,  coal,  kerosene,  and 
paraffine  candles.  They  have  good  church  buildings  on  each  island,  and  schools  with 
teachers  as  well  as  doctors,  at  the  expense  of  the  company. 

The  natives  of  the  seal  islands  are  not  long  lived.  Sixty  is  old  age,  to  which  few  ever  reach, 
and  even  those  of  fifty  are  scarce.  The  population  has  not  increased  to  any  appreciable 
extent  since  the  United  States  came  into  possession. 

Like  all  other  Aleuts,  the  natives  of  the  seal  islands  die  generally  of  consumption.  When  it 
once  appears  it  makes  rapid  work,  and  in  a  few  days  its  victim  is  laid  away.  Whatever  may 
be  the  restorative  qualities  of  fish-oil  blubber,  it  does  not  seem  to  benefit  these  people. 

They  all  eat  enormously  of  these  commodities,  and,  as  a  rule,  die  early.  When  attacked, 
physicians  are  in  vain,  and  the  patient  falls  at  once  into  a  condition  of  hopeless  indifference, 
generally  refusing  medicine,  or  neglecting  to  take  it  during  the  doctor’s  absence. 

These  people  give  liberally  toward  the  support  of  their  church,  and  buy  many  blessed 
candles  at  high  prices.  The  church  decorations  of  silver  chandeliers,  candelabras,  and 
pictures  are  both  elaborate  and  expensive.  Large  gilt  candles  have  been  sent  from  the  San 
Francisco  Consistory  at  the  rate  of  three  for  fifty  dollars,  and,  though  this  was  considered 
high,  they  were  paid  for.  They  were  large  candles,  it  is  true,  but,  judging  from  the  material 
of  which  they  are  composed,  they  should  not  cost  more  than  four  or  five  dollars  each,  even 
including  the  rather  tawdry  gilding  upon  their  surfaces.  But  the  seal-islanders  believe  in 
blessed  candles  and  can  afford  to  pay  for  them. 

The  “second”  priest,  or  “striker,”  as  he  is  sometimes  denominated  by  irreverent  Yankees, 
the  “second  mate,”  as  the  sailors  call  him,  is  an  institution  of  the  Russian  Church  in  Alaska. 
The  second  priest  can  hold  services,  but  is  not  endowed  with  the  right  to  perform  the 
marriage  ceremony.  He  leads  the  choir  and  attends  on  the  first  priest  at  mass.  Sometimes 
the  marriage  ceremony  is  waived  by  parties  entering  into  the  marital  state  in  the  absence 
of  a  first  priest,  but  when  that  individual  comes  around,  he  makes  it  all  right,  and  it  is 
considered  that  no  harm  has  been  done. 

The  vestments  worn  by  the  priest  are  very  rich,  but  sometimes  when  he  appears  in  garment 
of  gold  and  white,  with  cavalry  boots  below,  as  often  happens,  the  effect  strikes  strangers 
as  being  strong  and  novel  rather  than  strictly  ecclesiastic.  It  speaks  somewhat  loudly  of 
church  militant. 

There  is  no  beer  nor  whiskey  to  be  had  by  the  natives  of  the  fur-seal  islands.  The  Treasury 
Department  forbids  the  manufacture  here  or  the  introduction  of  beverages  of  an 
intoxicating  character.  Efforts  have  been  made  in  other  Aleutian  settlements  to  prevent  the 
manufacture  of  “quass,”  a  sort  of  sour  beer  manufactured  out  of  sugar,  flour,  and  water;  but 
where  there  are  two  or  more  trading  companies  in  competition,  the  sugar  can  be  obtained 
from  one,  if  not  from  the  other,  and  the  suppression  of  the  traffic  in  such  a  community  is 
almost  impossible.  On  the  fur-seal  islands,  however,  Treasury  and  company  agents  unite 
in  efforts  to  suppress  the  manufacture  of  strong  drink.  It  was,  for  a  long  time,  difficult 
to  reconcile  these  Aleuts  to  getting  along  without  spirits.  Under  Russian  rule  it  was  the 
custom  to  issue  spirits  to  the  men  when  at  work,  and  this  created  an  appetite,  which  was 
sought  to  be  allayed  by  other  drink  when  merchantable  whiskey  could  not  be  had. . . . 

Tea  is  now  the  strongest  beverage  that  these  people  absorb.  The  tea  used  here  is  of  a 
superior  quality,  the  same  chop  as  that  furnished  by  the  Russians  years  and  years  ago.  The 
people  don’t  want  any  other  kind,  and  the  company  is  perfectly  willing  to  provide  that 
which  they  prefer. 

The  seal  islands  are  situated  in  Behring  Sea,  and  during  the  warmer  months  are  almost 
continually  enveloped  in  fogs  and  mist.  This  is  one  reason  why  the  seals  make  them  their 
breeding  grounds.  There  is  no  such  thing  in  the  seal  business  as  “making  hay  while  the 
sun  shines,”  for  the  sun  will  drive  the  warm-coated  animals  into  the  water,  when  men  with

clubs  could  not  do  it;  for  though  the  two  and  four-year-olds  may  be  herded  and  driven  like 
sheep,  the  older  bulls,  when  on  the  rookeries,  cannot  be  forced  away  by  threats  of  violence. 
Continued  sunshine,  however,  would  soon  banish  them  from  the  islands. 

St.  George’s  Island  which,  on  a  clear  day,  can  be  seen  from  St.  Paul’s,  is  an  epitome  of  the 
larger  one.  The  population,  at  the  last  count,  was  one  hundred  and  two  persons.  They  have 
a  church,  school-house,  and  frame  dwellings  for  the  people  provided  by  the  company, 
which  controls  in  all  these  matters  and  furnishes  the  modern  improvements  according  to 
the  ideas  of  its  officers,  whose  suggestions  in  these  matters  are  adopted. 

Near  Garden  Cove,  on  the  southeast  coast  of  St.  George’s  Island,  is  a  large  sea-lion  rookery, 
the  beach  being  red  with  the  monsters,  which  lay  packed  together  like  hogs  in  a  stock  car 
going  to  market.  The  sea  lion  is  found  also  on  St.  Paul’s,  but  not  so  numerously  as  on  St. 
George’s.  The  sea  lion  seems  to  be  more  like  an  overgrown  seal,  larger  than  the  fur-seal 
bulls,  but  their  coat  consists  of  hair  only,  which  is  of  a  coarse  reddish  brown.  The  flesh  of 
the  sea  lion  is  preferred  to  that  of  the  fur  seal,  and  the  hide,  while  having  no  value  in  the 
markets  of  the  world,  is  in  great  demand  among  the  Aleuts  and  Indians  of  the  Northern 
Pacific  and  Behring  Sea.  The  leather  is,  however,  used  to  a  limited  extent  on  emery  wheels 
for  polishing  in  cutlery  factories. 

The  flippers  of  the  sea  lion  are  used  for  soles  of  the  Aleut  waterproof  boots;  the  skin  is 
converted  into  coverings  for  the  large  open  boats  known  as  “bidarras.”  These  boats  consist 
of  a  frame  of  wood  with  ribs  imported  from  the  Eastern  States.  The  lion  skins,  the  hair 
shaved  off,  are  stretched  over  the  frame,  fifteen  or  twenty  being  sewed  together,  and  when 
dry  they  are  as  tight  as  a  drum.  These  boats  are  constructed  about  forty  feet  in  length  and 
ten  or  twelve  feet  beam,  with  a  carrying  capacity  of  from  two  to  four  tons. 

The  bidarra  is  the  favorite  craft  with  the  seal  islanders  as  the  two-hole  bidarkie  is  with  the 
Western  Aleuts,  the  three-holed  with  the  Kadiackers,  and  the  fifty-foot  cedar  dugouts  with 
the  Hyda  Indians. . . . 

Sea  Otter  Island,  lying  about  five  miles  southwardly  from  St.  Paul’s,  is  another  landing- 
place  for  the  fur  seal,  but  only  to  a  limited  extent.  Owing  to  the  fact  that  it  is  not 
permanently  inhabited,  some  marauders  were  in  the  habit  of  landing  on  the  opposite 
side,  where  they  could  not  be  seen  from  St.  Paul’s,  and  killing  whatever  seal  they  could 
find,  without  regard  to  sex,  age,  or  condition.  The  company  reported  these  facts  to  the 
Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  who  decided  that  the  intention  of  the  act  under  which  the  lease 
was  authorized  appeared  to  be  to  give  all  the  islands  of  the  group  to  the  lessees,  for  the 
regulation  of  the  traffic  and  preservation  of  the  fur  seal.  Then,  as  the  company  could  not 
defend  Sea  Otter  Island,  the  Government  was  asked  to  do  so,  and  now  the  practice  is  to 
leave  a  revenue  marine  guard  there  during  the  sealing  season. 

Sea  Otter  Island  is  famous  for  sea  fowls’  eggs,  and  also  for  foxes,  [the]  latter  [of  which]  so 
infest  the  place  that  a  former  revenue  marine  officer  experienced  great  difficulty  in  keeping 
the  pests  from  destroying  everything  destroyable  in  his  cabin.  Birds’  eggs,  buried  beneath 
the  floor  were  ravished  by  these  cunning  animals,  which,  during  the  officer’s  absence,  dug 
under  the  walls  and  made  their  way  into  the  house.  They  are  principally  blue  foxes,  such  as 
are  found  on  St.  Paul’s  and  St.  George’s. 

There  is  one  more,  Walrus  Island,  in  the  Prybilov  group,  about  six  miles  eastward  from  St. 
Paul,  to  which  male  walruses  resort  in  considerable  numbers  each  year.  It  is  also  famous  for 
sea  fowl,  which  resort  thither  in  countless  millions  for  breeding  purposes.  But  no  fur  seals 
are  killed  by  the  lessees  upon  either  Otter  or  Walrus  islands. 

As  only  natives  may  be  employed  to  kill  the  seals,  no  whites  are  permitted  to  remain 
upon  the  Prybilov  Islands  unless  either  in  the  service  of  the  United  States  or  of  the  Alaska 
Commercial  Company — except  the  Russian  priests.19

Agent,  Alaska  Commercial  Company,  1870-1890 
Agent,  North  American  Commercial  Company,  1890-1900 

Genealogy 

Daniel  Webster  was  born  at  New  London,  Connecticut,  in  April  1832.  In  about  1859,  after 
Webster  had  been  a  whaler  for  fourteen  years,  he  married  Emma  Bailey  (1841-1901)  at 
New  London.  Emma  was  the  daughter  of  shoemaker  Charles  W.  Bailey  and  Elizabeth 
Bailey.  Emma’s  brother  Charles  Jr.  was  also  a  whaler.  Daniel  and  Emma  had  a  son,  George, 
who  died  shortly  after  his  birth  in  April  1860  in  New  London.  In  January  1862,  another 
son  was  born  whom  they  also  named  George,  but  with  the  middle  name  of  Payne.  The 
Webster  family  spent  summers  on  the  Pribilof  Islands  during  George’s  early  years,  as 
noted  in  the  Agent’s  Log,  which  listed  arrivals  to  the  island:  “Wednesday,  May  28,  1873, 
arrive  at  St.  Paul,  Daniel  Webster,  wife  and  son  George.” 

Daniel  Webster  died  in  June  1900  on  St.  George  Island  during  a  three-week  epidemic 
of  la  gripped  Emma  Webster  was  living  in  Oakland,  California,  at  the  time,  with  son 
George  (1862-1953),  George’s  first  wife,  Ida  B.  Williams  Webster,  and  their  daughter, 
Gladys,  plus  George’s  mother-in-law,  Harriet  Williams.  Emma  Webster  died  the  next 
year,  on  August  27,  1901,  in  Oakland.  George  Payne  Webster  became  a  well-known  actor 
in  the  San  Francisco  theater  and  lived  to  be  91  years  of  age.  His  daughter,  Gladys,  re¬ 
mained  single  and  followed  her  father  into  show  business  as  an  actress  and  a  teacher  of 
theater  arts.25 

Biographical  Sketch 

At  the  age  of  fourteen,  Daniel  Webster  ventured  to  sea  as  a  “whale-man.”  He  testified  that 
he  spent  twenty-three  years  in  the  Bering  Sea  and  the  North  Pacific  as  a  whaler.26 


Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

Daniel  Webster  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  before  Treasury  Agent-in-Charge 
William  H.  Williams  at  St.  George  Island,  Alaska,  on  June  11,  1892.  The  following  is  an 
excerpt  from  his  deposition. 

I  am  60  years  of  age,  and  am  a  resident  of  Oakland,  Cal;  my  occupation  is  that  of  local 
agent  for  the  North  American  Commercial  Company,  and  at  present  I  am  stationed  on 
St.  George  Island,  of  the  Pribilof  Group,  Alaska.  I  have  been  in  Alaskan  waters  every  year 
but  two  since  I  was  fourteen  years  of  age.  I  first  went  to  Behring  Sea  in  1845  on  a  whaling 
voyage,  and  annually  visited  those  waters  in  that  pursuit  until  1868,  at  which  time  the 
purchase  and  transfer  of  Alaska  was  made  to  the  United  States;  since  that  time  I  have  been 
engaged  in  the  taking  of  fur  seals  for  their  skins.  In  1870  I  entered  the  employ  of  the  lessees 
of  the  Pribilof  Islands  and  have  been  so  engaged  ever  since,  and  for  the  last  thirteen  years 
have  been  the  company’s  local  agent  on  St.  George  Island,  and  during  the  sealing  season 
have,  a  part  of  the  time,  gone  to  St.  Paul  Island  and  took  charge  of  the  killing  at  Northeast 
Point,  which  is  known  to  be  the  largest  fur  seal  rookery  in  the  world.  For  ten  years  prior 
to  1878  I  resided  most  of  the  time  at  Northeast  Point,  having  landed  and  taken  seals  there 
in  1868. 1  have  had  twenty-four  years’  experience  in  the  fur-seal  industry  as  it  exists  in  the 
waters  of  the  North  Pacific  and  Behring  Sea.27

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Daniel  Webster  went  to  the  Pribilofs  from  the  whaling  center  of  New  London,  Connecticut. 
The  whaling  fleet  at  New  Bedford,  Massachusetts,  is  better  known,  but  New  London’s  fleet 
was  smaller  by  only  one  vessel.28  “Webster  came  ashore  on  St.  Paul  Island  in  the  spring 
(April)  of  1868,  an  employee  of  Williams  and  Havens,  of  New  London,  Connecticut.  He 
took  charge  of  the  sealing  then  begun  on  behalf  of  this  firm  at  Novastoshna(h)  or  North 
East  Point.  Hutchinson,  Kohl  and  Co.  had  the  only  other  party  up  there  at  that  time.  This 
was  the  first  irregular  sealing  ever  done  upon  this  island  since  1804. 

“Webster  said  that  H.  I<.  and  Co.  and  he  took  over  75,000  young  male  seals  at  N.  E. 
Point  alone,  that  summer  of  1868,  and  only  stopped  work  from  sheer  exhaustion  of  their 
men,  who  were  not  only  physically  “used  up,”  but  also  they  had  used  up  all  their  salt  and 
had  no  suitable  means  left  of  saving  any  more  skins.”29 

Webster’s  travels  as  a  whaler  probably  brought  many  opportunities  to  acquire  valu¬ 
able  goods  and  may  be  how  Webster  acquired  a  ruby  ring  and  the  ivory-tipped  cane  that, 
according  to  local  Pribilof  lore,  he  always  carried. 

He  is  said  to  have  had  the  respect  of  the  Aleuts,  even  though  he  was  occasionally 
gruff.  Assistant  Agent  William  Gavitt  accused  Webster  and  others  of  gross  misconduct 
during  Gavitt ’s  time  on  St.  George,  1887-1888,  accusations  that  led  to  a  Congressional 
investigation.  Numerous  individuals  testified  before  the  Congressional  committee,  and 
nearly  all  of  those  who  mentioned  Webster  spoke  kindly  of  him. 50

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Former  Assistant  Treasury  Agent  George  Wardman  reflected  upon  Webster’s  char¬ 
acter  over  the  course  of  his  testimony  before  the  Committee  on  Merchant  Marine  and 
Fisheries  in  1888: 

Mr.  Webster  is  an  old  “shell-back,”  a  white  headed  old  man.  He  was  an  old  whaler.  He  had 
been  whaling  up  in  the  Ochotsk  [sic]  Sea  and  in  the  Arctic  Sea  before  the  United  States 
acquired  Alaska.  I  think  he  was  in  the  Arctic  Sea  in  1854. ...  He  was  a  quarrelsome  old 
man.  I  never  had  any  trouble  with  Mr.  Webster.  If  I  found  him  growling,  I  would  turn  him 
and  give  him  a  “bluff.” 

. . .  when  I  wanted  to  seize  the  schooner  Alexander,  and  had  left  Mr.  Kirk  aboard  till  I 
talked  with  Webster.  I  would  not  seize  her  formally  unless  Webster  would  take  her,  because 
I  did  not  want  her  to  go  on  the  rocks  there.  There  was  no  harbor.  I  went  ashore  and  told 
Mr.  Webster  that  if  he  would  take  her  over  to  the  other  island  [St.  Paul]  or  down  to  San 
Francisco  and  deliver  her  to  the  United  States  marshal,  I  would  seize  her.  He  said  he  would 
see  the  Government  damned  first.  He  said  he  had  had  one  experience  of  that  kind  and  that 
one  was  sufficient. . . . 

During  the  winter  there  was  a  good  deal  of  “chaffing”  and  joking  going  on  between  Dr. 

Noyes  and  Webster.  Dr.  Noyes  used  to  put  hair  nets  and  garters  and  such  things  in  old  man 
Webster’s  bed— he  used  to  slip  in  there  when  Webster  was  out— so  that  the  woman  who 
made  up  the  beds  would  see  them,  and  she  would  tell  all  over  the  village  that  a  woman  had 
been  sleeping  with  Mr.  Webster.  They  had  great  sport  out  of  that.31 

Daniel  Webster  was  eulogized  in  the  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s  Log  soon  after  word  came 
of  his  death  on  St.  George  Island: 

Captain  Webster  was  an  old  and  highly  respected  resident  of  Alaska  he  having  lived  on  the 
Seal  Islands  almost  continuously  since  American  Occupation.32

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Soon  after  evacuees  were  returned  to  the  Pribilofs  at  the  end  of  WWII,  Dr.  Herbert  Wentz 
wrote  about  nutritional  concerns: 

St.  George  is  a  village  on  an  island  of  the  same  name,  comprising  30  houses  for  the 
villagers’  32  families  that  vary  in  number  from  1  to  14. 

As  food— celery,  cabbage,  lettuce,  onions,  radishes,  turnips,  etc.,  is  essential  to  a  well 
balanced  diet,  and  a  well  balanced  diet  is  urged  so  that  a  green  house,  having  a  floor  space 
of  at  least  10,000  square  feet  be  erected  here  as  speedily  as  possible. 

That  a  green  house  can  be  operated  here  successfully  is  demonstrated  by  the  green  house 
operated  by  the  Agent  and  the  Storekeeper.33 

The  doctor’s  recommendation  apparently  went  unheeded  on  St.  George  Island. 
During  earlier  times  greenhouses  had  been  successfully  used  on  St.  Paul  Island,  but  their 
yield  was  primarily  for  the  government  employees  and  the  island’s  priest.

Whitney,  Alvin  Goodnow 

Schoolteacher,  St.  Paul  Island,  1912-1914 

Genealogy 

Alvin  Goodnow  Whitney  was  born  March  4, 
1883,  in  Hamilton,  Ontario,  Canada,  the  son  of 
George  Plummer  Whitney  and  Carrie  (Goodman) 
Whitney.  George  Whitney  worked  as  a  carder.54 
On  July  28,  1912,  in  Washington,  D.C.,  Alvin 
Whitney  married  Elsie  Julia  Gibson,  born  March 

15,  1885,  in  Ryegate,  Caledonia,  Vermont,  to 
Albert  and  Ruth  (Brown)  Gibson.  Alvin  Whitney 
died  June  19,  1960  in  Delmar,  Albany,  New  York, 
where  Elsie  Whitney  died  ten  years  later,  January 

16,  1970.35 

Biographical  Sketch 

Alvin  Whitney  graduated  from  Dartmouth 
College.  He  was  on  the  faculty  of  Syracuse 
University  School  of  Forestry  and  the  University 
of  Michigan  School  of  Forestry  before  becoming  assistant  director  of  the  New  York  State 
Museum  in  Albany.36 

Whitney’s  strong  character  exhibited  itself  in  the  Pribilofs,  as  discussed  below,  and 
also  afterward,  when  he  found  himself  accused  of  sedition.  The  Syracuse  Herald  (New 
York)  ran  a  story  under  a  back-page  headline,  “Alvin  G.  Whitney,  Forestry  Instructor 
Held  on  Charge  of  Sedition.”  He  was  a  thirty-four  year-old  graduate  student  at  the  State 
College  of  Forestry,  Syracuse,  New  York,  when  he  filled  out  a  U.S.  Census  form  and  chal¬ 
lenged  the  government’s  involvement  in  “The  Great  War,”  now  known  as  World  War  I. 
Whitney  reportedly  stated  on  the  form  that  he  was  claiming  “an  exemption  from  mil¬ 
itary  duty  because  he  was  unwilling  to  assist  the  state  or  national  government  in  the 
present  dishonorable  war.”  He  told  reporters,  “I  am  conscientiously  opposed  to  all  war. 
I  thought  that  every  one  in  this  country  had  the  right  of  free  speech  and  of  expressing 
an  opinion  according  to  his  conscience.  I  am  not  a  religious  member  of  any  sect  against 
war,  but  those  are  my  personal  views.  I  am  a  believer  in  constructive  work  and  not  work 
of  destruction,  which  I  regard  this  war  to  be.  I  am  an  American  and  a  firm  believer  of 
American  institutions.  I  was  employed  by  the  Government  to  make  a  survey  of  the  fisher¬ 
ies  conditions  in  Alaska  three  years  ago,  and  made  a  report  which  was  pronounced,  I  am 
told,  very  satisfactory.”5  We  did  not  learn  how  Whitney’s  case  was  officially  settled,  but 
given  his  subsequent  career  record,  as  previously  noted,  it  appears  he  was  not  profession¬ 
ally  ruined  by  his  outspokenness.

Biographies  W  ♦  Whitney 


Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

During  the  course  of  his  career,  Alvin  Whitney  had  clerked  for  Clinton  Hart  Merriam, 
who  had  been  on  the  Bering  Sea  Commission  to  investigate  the  Seal  Islands  (see  Merriam’s 
biography).  Whitney’s  professional  relationship  with  Dr.  Merriam  led  to  a  government 
offer  to  teach  on  St.  Paul  Island,  but  the  position  required  that  he  be  married.  A  local 
newspaper  made  much  of  his  ensuing  wedding  (“Bureau  of  Fisheries  as  a  Matrimonial 
Agency”  was  the  headline),  but  he  and  Elsie  Gibson  were  already  engaged.  The  lengthy 
newspaper  story  concluded: 

The  school  system  of  the  Pribiloffs  is  a  division  of  the  work  of  the  bureau  of  fisheries.  It  is 
the  intention  of  the  government  to  have  two  teachers  on  each  of  the  large  islands  of  the 
group.  The  fisheries  people  prefer  that  they  have  a  man  teacher  and  a  woman.  They  also 
prefer  to  have  them  a  married  couple. . . . 

So  Mr.  Whitney  betook  himself  to  a  telegraph  office  and  sent  the  following  to  his  fiancee, 

Miss  Elsie  J.  Gibson  of  Burlington,  Vt.,  who  was  attending  the  summer  school  for  teachers 
at  Dartmouth  college: 

“Have  offer  for  good  teaching  position  for  you  at  St.  Paul,  Pribiloff  island.  Salary  twelve 
hundred,  matrimony  a  pre-requisite.  Answer  paid.” 

Twelve  hours  later  Mr.  Whitney  received  an  even  shorter  dispatch.  It  said: 

“Leaving  for  Washington;  arrive  Sunday  morning.” 

Mr.  Whitney  went  to  the  bureau  of  fisheries  and  told  Chief  Barton  W.  Evermann  of  the 
Alaskan  division  [sic]  he  had  the  candidate  for  the  other  teaching  vacancy. 

“Name  please?”  said  Mr.  Evermann. 

“It’s  Gibson  now,  but  if  you  don’t  want  to  make  out  the  papers  until  Monday,  it  will  be 
Whitney,”  replied  the  male  candidate.38 

The  Whitneys  taught  school  as  government  employees  on  St.  Paul  Island  during  the 
1912-1914  school  years.  The  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s  Log  recorded  their  arrival  aboard  the 
steamer  Homer  on  August  28,  1912,  identifying  Whitney  as  the  schoolteacher  and  Elsie 
Whitney  as  the  “assistant  school-teacher.”  Few  detailed  references  to  the  Whitneys  were 
entered  into  the  St.  Paul  Island  Agent’s  Log  during  their  two-year  stay.  The  following  ex¬ 
amples  were  among  them. 

[On  October  2,  1912]  at  8.30  p.m.  all  hands  were  turned  out  with  lanterns  in  a  pouring 
rain  to  search  for  Mrs.  Whitney  who  had  left  the  village  alone  at  3  p.m.  Although  at 
her  departure  she  had  said  nothing  to  anyone  as  to  her  destination,  I  gathered  from  the 
statements  of  her  husband,  who  had  watched  her  as  far  as  he  could  from  Telegraph  Hill, 
that  she  was  somewhere  between  the  village  and  Halfway  Point  and  south  of  the  wagon 
road  to  North  East  Point.  The  night  was  pitch  dark. 

The  advance  guard  of  the  searching  party  . . .  encountered  Mrs.  Whitney  on  the  wagon 
road  between  the  wells  and  the  ice-house  lake,  returning  unconcernedly,  although  wet  to 
the  skin.  She  had  climbed  Polavina  according  to  her  statement.39 

An  Agent’s  Log  entry  in  December  1912  credited  the  Whitneys  with  putting  on  a 
Christmas  Eve  skit  involving  the  schoolchildren— “Little  Jack  Horner  and  his  Christmas 
Pie”— in  the  Native  shop.40

Bureau  of  Fisheries  as  a  Matrimonial  Agency 


WASHINGTON. — As  a  matrimonial 
agency  the  United  States  bureau 
of  fisheries  has  stepped  into  sudden 
prominence-  The  methods  of  the  bu¬ 
reau  are  unique.  The  unions  are  ob¬ 
tained  with  speed  and  precision.  The 
bureau  embarked  in  its  new  line  of  en¬ 
deavor  the  other  day.  The  result  of 
its  first  attempt  is  speeding  happily 
westward  with  a  honeymoon  in  the 
"weet  breezes  of  the  PribilofT  islands 
as  an  objective.  It  all  came  about  in 
this  way. 

Out  in  the  Pribiloffs  there  are  few- 
white  people,  but  many  Alieuts,  and 
the  progeny  of  the  Alieuts  are  both  nu¬ 
merous  and  ignorant.  To  the  bureau 
of  fisheries,  which  is  the  real  gov¬ 
ernment  of  the  Pribiloffs  and  the 
Alieuts  and  seals  which  there  abound, 
has  been  delegated  the  task  of  bring¬ 
ing  light  where  heretofore  was  dark¬ 
ness.  The  school  system  of  the  Prib¬ 
iloffs  is  a  division  of  the  work  of  the 
bureau  of  fisheries.  It  is  the  intention 
of  the  government  to  have  two 
teachers  on  each  of  the  large  islands 
of  the  group.  The  fisheries  people 
prefer  that  they  have  a  man  teacher 
and  a  woman.  They  also  prefer  to 
have  them  a  married  couple. 

Casting  about  lor  new  material,  the 
bureau  found  that  Alvin  G.  Whitney 
of  Groton,  Mass.,  wanted  to  become  an 


Alaskan  school  teacher.  Mr.  Whitney 
passed  the  examination  in  fine  stvle. 
He  was  just  about  to  be  appointed 
when  it  was  explained  to  him  that  the 
Pribiloff  government,  which  is  the 
bureau  of  fisheries,  wanted  married 
teachers.  The  case  was  explained  to 
him  by  Dr.  C.  Hart  Merriam,  one  time 
biologist  of  the  department  of  agri¬ 
culture,  whose  secretary  Mr.  Whitney 
formerly  was. 

"Do  you  know  any  one  who  could  fill 
the  vacancy  at  the  island  of  St.  Paul 
to  which  you  will  be  assigned?"  asked 
Mr.  Merriam. 

“Sure,"  replied  Mr.  Whitney,  *T11 
telegraph  and  find  out  about  it  right 
away." 

So  Mr.  Whitney  betook  himself  to  a 
telegraph  office  and  sent  the  following 
to  his  fiancee.  Miss  Eisie  J.  Gibson  of 
Burlington,  Vt.,  who  was  attending  the 
summer  school  for  teachers  at  Dart¬ 
mouth  college: 

"Have  offer  for  good  teaching  posi 
tion  for  you  at  St.  Paul,  Pribiloff  is 
land.  Salary  twelve  hundred,  matri 
mony  pre-requisite.  Answer  paid." 

Twelve  hours  later  Mr.  Whitney  re¬ 
ceived  an  even  shorter  dispatch.  It 
said: 

"Leaving  for  Washington;  arrive 
Sunday  morning." 

Mr.  Whitney  went  to  the  bureau  of 
fisheries  and  told  Chief  Barton  W.  Ev- 
ermann  of  the  Alaskan  division  that 
he  had  the  candidate  for  the  other 
teaching  vacancy. 

"Name,  please?"  said  Mr.  Evermann. 

"It's  Gibson  now,  but  if  you  don’t 
want  to  make  out  the  papers  until 
Monday,  it  will  be  Whitney,”  replied 
the  male  candidate.

September  28,  1912,  8.)

Biographies  W  ♦  Whitney 


In  1913,  Mr.  Whitney  was  noted  as  accompanying  Professor  George  Clark,  pre¬ 
sumably  as  part  of  Clarks  introduction  to  the  island  environment.  “Messrs.  Clark  and 
Whitney  were  sent  in  the  launch  to  Zapadni,  whence  they  walked  to  the  village  photo¬ 
graphing  the  rookeries  en  route.”41 

The  Whitneys’  own  writings  during  this  period  are  much  more  dramatic.  According 
to  a  news  article,  they  kept  a  daily  diary  from  July  1913  to  May  17,  1914, 42  and  within 
that  diary  they  “recited  almost  daily  allegations  of  scandalous  conduct  on  the  part  of  of¬ 
ficials.”43  Purportedly,  the  diary  documented  malfeasance  by  five  government  employees. 
We  did  not  locate  the  Whitneys’  diary  or  any  government  documents  quoting  from  it. 
However,  the  New  York  Times  reproduced  some  of  their  entries  in  a  story  on  July  21, 1914, 
and  several  are  recounted  here. 

Aug.  19  to  22,  1913.  The  yacht  Adventuress  arrived  Aug.  19  with  Roy  C.  Andrews  and  the 
yachting  and  hunting  party  he  accompanied  [see  Roy  Andrews  biography].  [Agent  and 
Caretaker,  Phillip  R.  E.]  Hatton,  Tongue,  and  Dr.  McGovern  spent  days  entertaining  the 
party  on  shore  or  visiting  on  board  the  yacht.  Their  entertainment  was  invariably  gambling 
and  drinking  day  and  night.  During  this  interval  Mr.  Andrews  and  I  were  occupying  our 
time  with  photographic  work. 

While  one  would  not  expect  Agent  Hatton  to  include  entries  in  his  log  of  “gambling 
and  drinking  day  and  night,”  some  of  his  entries  seem  to  undercut  at  least  some  of  the 
Whitney’s  allegations,  including  one  about  the  Whitneys  spending  an  evening  on  the 
yacht  Adventuress .44 


Tuesday,  Aug.  19,  1913 

At  5:30  P.  M.  today  the  yacht  Adventuress,  belonging  to  Mr.  John  Borden  came  to  anchor 
off  village  landing.  Mr.  Tongue  and  I  went  out  to  [the]  yacht  with  several  natives  at  7  P.M. 
and  Mr.  Andrews  came  ashore  with  us  to  spend  the  night. 

Wednesday,  Aug.  20,  1913 

Messrs.  John  Borden,  Scott,  Brown,  Harris,  and  Capt.  Sparks  were  ashore  to  lunch  and 
dinner.  Messrs.  Andrews,  Borden,  Harris,  Brown,  and  Scott  stayed  ashore  for  the  night. 
Crew  from  yacht  visited  Reef  rookeries  today  with  an  escort. 

Thursday,  Aug.  21,  1913 

On  Mr.  Borden’s  invitation,  Mrs.  Chamberlain,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Whitney,  Mr.  Tongue,  Dr. 
McGovern  and  I  [Hatton]  had  dinner  aboard  the  yacht  at  6  P.M.  Mr.  Borden  and  the  whole 
party  were  very  nice  to  all  and  we  returned  about  9  o’clock,  having  spent  an  enjoyable 
evening. 


Friday,  Aug.  22,  1913 

Mr.  Andrews  received  a  message  from  Unalaska  tonight  which  required  his  presence  on  the 
yacht.  I  [Hatton]  went  out  to  the  ship  with  Mr.  Andrews  and  several  natives  in  the  launch  at 
9  P.M.  [The]  boatkeeper  and  engineer  for  launch,  was  running  the  engine  and  I  discovered, 
after  leaving  the  dock,  that  he  was  so  drunk  that  he  could  hardly  understand  anything 
about  the  engine.  I  then  told  Mike  Kozlof  to  take  the  tiller  and  ordered  [the  boatkeeper]  out 
of  the  engine  room  and  ran  the  engine  myself.  [The  boatkeeper]  is  a  good  man  about  the 
boats  and  engine  when  he  is  sober,  but  when  even  slightly  drunk  not  a  bit  of  reliance  can  be 
had  in  his  actions.  We  returned  from  the  yacht  at  10  P.M. 

Regarding  the  above  incident,  the  Whitneys  reportedly  stated  in  their  diary: 


625 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


When  Mr.  Andrews  and  Mr.  Hatton  went  out  to  the  yacht  in  the  evening  to  bring  the 
former's  outfit  ashore  the  native  engineer  was  so  drunk  as  to  be  useless  and  came  near 
sinking  the  launch.  The  weather  was  stormy  and  dark  and  the  sea  rough.  The  delay  of  the 
party  in  returning  caused  great  apprehension  on  shore  and  finally  a  rescuing  party  prepared 
to  set  out.  At  this  juncture  Dr.  McGovern  who  was  drunk  got  into  a  quarrel  with  the  native 
boatsman  and  ended  up  by  a  fist  fight  with  the  Russian  priest.45 

The  next  day,  Agent  Hatton  wrote  in  the  log. 

Saturday,  Aug.  23,  1913 

Yacht  Adventuress,  left  about  day[break]  this  morning  for  Unalaska.  Mr.  Andrews  did  not 
leave  on  the  yacht  but  will  go  to  Unalaska  on  a  cutter  later  on. 

Agent  Hatton  did  record  in  the  log  that  Alvin  Whitney  accompanied  filmmaker 
Roy  C.  Andrews  over  several  days  in  August  1913,  to  film  seals  at  Reef,  Gorbatch,  and 
Northeast  Point  rookeries46  (see  Roy  Andrews  biography). 

About  two  weeks  after  the  Adventuress  departed  the  Seal  Islands,  and  about  a  year 
before  the  Whitneys  released  their  allegations,  schoolteacher  Whitney  was  accused  by 
boatkeeper  Neon  Tetoff  of  assaulting  his  sixteen-year-old  son. 

Neon  Tetof  [sic]  came  to  the  office  after  dinner  tonight  and  complained  that  his  son 
Dimitria  [sic]  had  been  beaten  in  a  shameful  manner  by  Mr.  Whitney  in  the  school  this 
afternoon.  I  requested  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Whitney  to  come  down  to  the  office  and  we  all  talked 
the  matter  over.47 

Whitney  explained  the  incident  to  the  satisfaction  of  Agent  Hatton,  who  in  turn  ex¬ 
plained  the  basis  for  Whitney’s  actions  to  Dimitria’s  father,  which  conflicted  with  the 
story  told  by  the  young  Tetoff. 

We  explained  the  case  to  Neon  and  told  him  that  Dimitria  was  entirely  wrong  and  that  he 
would  have  to  do  better  in  school  or  some  severe  measures  would  be  taken.  Neon  finally 
agreed  that  his  son  had  acted  the  wrong  part  and  promised  to  censure  him  good  before 
sending  him  to  school  tomorrow. 

It  is  quite  evident  that  the  natives  on  these  islands  are  opposed  to  any  school  teacher  and 
they  all  look  upon  the  teachers  as  enemies.  If  who  is  in  charge  did  not  back  up  the  teachers 
and  help  them  maintain  order  and  attendance  then  the  school  department  here  would  be 
worse  than  useless.48 

According  to  the  New  York  Times  (July  21,  1914),  other  entries  in  the  Whitney  diary 
included: 

Sept.  20,  1913.  A  dance  was  held  at  night  at  the  native  shop.  Several  natives  were  drunk 
there. 

Nov.  23  to  29,  1913.  This  was  foxing  week  when  most  of  the  native  men  were  away  from 
the  village  trapping.  The  white  men  embraced  this  opportunity  to  seduce  native  women,  as 
I  afterward  learned.  When  the  hunters  returned  at  the  end  of  the  week  there  was  a  grand 
celebration,  practically  the  whole  community  being  drunk. 

In  1914,  as  the  New  York  Times  article  stated,  Alvin  and  Elsie  Whitney  brought  allega¬ 
tions  against  five  government  men  on  the  Pribilof  Islands. 

Secretary  Redfield  of  the  Department  of  Commerce  has  submitted  all  the  original 
complaints  in  the  Pribilof  Islands  scandal  to  Attorney  General  McReynolds  for  action.  The

flagrant  law  violation  in  furnishing  intoxicating  liquors  to  the  natives,  and  illegal  killing  of 
fur  seal  pups.49 

Allegations  were  made  against  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  Agents  and  Caretakers  Phillip 
R.  Hatton  and  A.  H.  Proctor,  respectively;  St.  Paul  storekeeper  L.  N.  Tongue;  former  phy¬ 
sician  Dr.  C.  J.  McGovern;  and  the  Navy’s  wireless  operator  on  St.  Paul,  P.  L.  McClenny. 

After  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Whitney  had  forwarded  their  original  report,  Hatton  on  June  2 
telegraphed  his  resignation  to  the  Government  [sic].  At  the  same  time  Dr.  Henry  Esmond, 
a  physician  in  the  Federal  Fisheries  Service  on  the  island,  resigned.  Mr.  Whitney  learned  of 
this  and  he  at  once  sent  this  radio  message  to  Secretary  Redfield: 

Earnestly  request  immediate  inquiry  into  existing  conditions  on  St  Paul  Island  on  account 
several  employees  preparing  to  leave.  I  request  that  all  island  officials  be  held  pending 
investigation. 

Deputy  Commissioner  of  Fisheries  Ernest  Lester  Jones  happened  to  be  in  Alaskan 
waters  to  investigate  the  halibut  industry.  He  was  instructed  on  June  11  to  proceed  im¬ 
mediately  on  the  Albatross  to  the  Pribilof  Islands  to  investigate  the  scandal  (see  E.  Lester 
Jones  biography).50 

The  following  telegram  was  sent  to  Whitney: 

Do  not  allow  any  employe  [sic]  to  leave  pending  Jones’s  arrival.51 

On  June  12  the  resignations  were  refused  and  the  following  radio  message  was  sent  to 
Hatton  by  the  fisheries  commissioner: 

Hatton,  St.  Paul  Island,  Alaska  (wireless  via  North  Head,  Wash.): 

Your  resignation  not  accepted  pending  investigation  by  Deputy  Commissioner  Jones,  due 
at  islands  about  July  17.  Do  not  leave  prior  to  his  arrival  or  allow  any  employe  [sic]  to  do  so. 

SMITH,  Commissioner  of  Fisheries52 

Presumably,  the  Whitneys  departed  St.  Paul  Island  with  investigator  E.  Lester  Jones 
following  his  on-island  investigation. 

According  to  the  Bureau  of  Fisheries  Commissioner’s  annual  report  for  the  1914- 
1915  school  year,  school  conditions  improved  remarkably  under  Mr.  and  Mr.  George 
Haley  following  the  departure  of  the  Whitneys.53 

Alvin  Whitney  told  newspaper  reporters,  as  noted  earlier,  that  he  was  hired  by  the 
government  to  report  on  the  fisheries  of  Alaska.  We  did  not  find  any  other  reference  to 
such  a  report,  but  Whitney  was  given  credit  for  making  various  natural  history  collec¬ 
tions  on  St.  Paul  Island.  In  a  1923  Bureau  of  Biological  Survey  report  on  the  topic  of  the 
Pribilof  Islands,  author  Edward  Preble  wrote: 

Alvin  G.  Whitney,  school-teacher  on  St.  Paul  Island  from  the  summer  of  1912  to  the 
summer  of  1914,  made  considerable  collections  of  insects  and  shells  and  some  other 
invertebrates,  but  his  contributions  to  ornithology  and  mammalogy  were  small.54 

Preble  did  not  cite  any  report  by  Whitney  in  those  regards.  Many  years  later,  in  1960, 
former  Pribilof  Islands  schoolteacher  and  natural  historian  G  Dallas  Hanna  mentioned 
Whitney  in  responding  to  a  question  about  the  name  and  number  of  lakes  on  St.  Paul 
Island.  Not  all  the  lakes  were  named  during  his  time  on  the  island,  Hanna  said,  but  they 


627 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


were  numbered.  “We  used  those  numbers  to  a  certain  extent.  And  there  is  one  that  was 
named  after  I  came  here  called  Whitney  Pond.  I  do  not  remember  where  Whitney  Pond 
is  or  which  one  it  was.  Whitney  was  a  schoolteacher  here  in  1913  and  he  collected  about 
a  half  a  dozen  birds,  some  of  which  were  very  important,  too,  but  that  lake  came  to  be 
called  Whitney  Pond.  You’ll  see  it  referred  to  in  some  of  the  literature,  I  think.  In  [George] 
Haley’s  notes  it  is  referred  to  very  frequently.  I  do  not  recall  that  any  of  the  lake  numbers 
were  ever  published.”55

Genealogy 

William  H.  Williams  was  born  in  1835  at  Lafayette, 
Medina  County,  Ohio,  the  son  of  Roswell  Williams 
(1808-1834)  and  Clarinda  Irena  (Jenkins)  Williams 
(1812-1870).  William  Williams  married  Louisa 
Corinne  Hitchcock,  daughter  of  William  Hitchcock 
and  Almira  Ann  (Bissell)  Hitchcock,  on  March  26, 
1860,  in  Medina  County,  Ohio.  Their  children,  all  born 
in  Medina  County,  were:  Gertrude  J.  Williams  (born 
1863,  married  Charles  R.  Bradley);  Don  R.  Williams 
(born  1868);  Clare  Garfield  Williams  (born  May  16, 
1872,  married  Lulu  Martin;  Clare  died  September  14, 
1957,  in  Los  Angeles,  California);  Carl  S.  Williams 
(born  May  16,  1872,  married  Annette  Pratt;  Carl  died 
November  9,  1960,  at  Pennsburg,  Pennsylvania);  and  Blake  Williams  (born  1876).56  Major 
William  H.  Williams  died  September  18,  1909,  at  Oak  Park,  Illinois,  at  the  age  of  seventy- 
three.57 

Biographical  Sketch 

The  pioneers  who  settled  at  Lafayette,  Ohio,  in  the  1820s  included  William  Williams’ 
father,  Roswell  Williams,  one  of  the  founders  of  the  first  Congregational  Church  at 
Lafayette  (April  17,  1824).58  William  H.  Williams  and  his  brother  Henry  and  sisters  Mary 
and  Laura  grew  up  in  Lafayette.  William  and  his  wife,  Louisa,  settled  after  their  marriage 
in  1860  in  the  town  of  Medina,  Ohio,  where  William  was  a  teacher.59  At  the  outbreak  of 
the  Civil  War,  he  enlisted  in  the  Union  Army  as  a  captain  of  the  42nd  Ohio  Infantry.  He 
showed  leadership  abilities  in  many  battles  and  by  May  of  1863  was  serving  as  a  major 
under  Major  General  Ulysses  S.  Grant  at  Vicksburg,  Mississippi.  A  monument  to  the 
42nd  Ohio  Infantry,  bearing  William  H.  Williams’  name,  is  located  on  Union  Avenue  at 
Vicksburg  National  Military  Park.60

After  the  Civil  War,  Major  Williams  returned 
to  the  family  farm  at  Lafayette.61  Ten  years  later,  the 
Williams  family  was  living  in  Chatham,  Ohio,  a  few 
miles  from  Lafayette.  William  became  a  cheese  man- 

had  moved 

to  the  larger  community  of  Wellington,  Ohio,  in  the 
neighboring  county  of  Lorain,  and  William  took  on  a 
new  job. 

On  May  27,  1891,  Major  Williams,  as  Special 
Agent  for  the  Department  of  the  Treasury,  left 
San  Francisco,  California,  for  the  Pribilof  Islands, 
in  the  company  of  Special  Commissioner  Joseph 
Stanley-Brown  and  Special  Agent  Louis  Nettleton.63 
Thus  began  Williams’  service  with  the  Treasury 
Department,  which  lasted  for  fifteen  years  and  includ¬ 
ed  the  uproarious  pelagic  sealing  era.  Major  Williams 
played  a  leading  role  in  the  Fur-Seal  Arbitration  at 
Paris,  France. 

Major  Williams,  one  of  the  American  attaches,  said 
that  the  result  of  the  regulations  [put  forward  by  the 
Paris  Tribunal  of  Arbitration]  would  probably  be  the 
abandonment  of  the  Canadian  pelagic  hunting,  as 
it  would  not  pay  under  the  restrictions  imposed.  The  consensus  of  opinion  among  the 
American  agents  and  counsel  is  that,  though  technical  success  rests  with  Great  Britain  on 
local  points,  on  practical  grounds  the  victory  is  to  the  United  States,  as  the  arbitration  was 
entered  upon  to  preserve  the  seals  and  the  decision  achieves  that  result.64 

As  time  would  soon  reveal,  Major  Williams  erred  in  his  assessment  that  the  award 
was  in  favor  of  the  United  States.  Regardless,  following  the  Fur-Seal  Arbitration  of  1893 
he  was  appointed  head  of  the  Europe  Foreign  Office  as  Special  Agent  of  the  Treasury, 
with  an  office  in  Paris.  Fie  was  sent  to  London  in  1898  when  the  law  against  pelagic  seal¬ 
ing  was  not  being  enforced. 

Major  Williams  . . .  has  acknowledged  that  his  inquiries  have  discouraged  him.  He 
believes  it  will  be  impossible  for  the  Government  to  enforce  the  law  in  its  present  form. 
Comparatively  few  of  the  sealskins  can  be  identified  after  they  have  passed  through  the 
hands  of  the  wholesale  and  the  retail  dealers.  So  it  looks  as  if  the  Government  would  have 
to  find  some  other  way  to  protect  the  seals  from  threatened  extinction.65 

On  October  1,  1904,  at  the  age  of  sixty-eight,  Major  Williams  arrived  in  New  York 
from  Europe  with  his  wife,  Louisa,  age  sixty-four.  They  settled  in  Oak  Park,  a  suburb 
of  Chicago,  Illinois.  At  the  time  of  his  death,  their  son  Carl  was  a  physician  practicing 
sports  medicine  in  Philadelphia,  and  son  Clare  was  a  U.S.  Customs  House  inspector  in 
San  Francisco.66

Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


Fur-Seal  Arbitration  Deposition 

William  H.  Williams  deposed  for  the  Tribunal  of  Arbitration  on  March  19,  1892,  before 
Notary  Public  Charles  H.  Hughes  at  Washington,  D.C.  The  following  is  an  excerpt: 

I  reside  at  Wellington,  Ohio  and  am  55  years  of  age.  I  am  the  United  States  Treasury  Agent 
in  charge  of  the  Seal  Islands  in  Bering  Sea. 

That  thousands  of  female  seals  were  captured  by  the  pelagic  hunters  in  Bering  Sea 
during  the  season  of  1891,  the  most  of  which  had  to  be  secured  quite  a  distance  from  the 
rookeries,  owing  to  the  presence  of  armed  vessels  patrolling  the  sea  for  miles  around  the 
islands,  and  that  the  slaughter  of  the  seals  was  mostly  of  females,  was  confirmed  by  the 
thousands  of  dead  pups  lying  on  the  rookeries  starved  to  death  by  the  destruction  of  their 
mothers. 

My  investigation  confirms  what  has  been  so  often  said  by  others  who  have  reported  upon 
this  subject,  and  that  is  that  the  Pribilof  Islands  are  the  great  breeding  grounds  of  the 
fur-seals,  and  that  they  can  be  reared  in  great  numbers  on  said  islands,  and  at  the  same 
time,  under  wise  and  judicious  restrictions,  a  certain  number  of  male  seals  can  be  killed 
from  year  to  year  without  injury  to  the  breeding  herds,  and  their  skins  disposed  of  for 
commercial  purposes,  thereby  building  up  and  perpetuating  this  great  industry  indefinitely, 
and  thus  adding  to  the  wealth,  happiness,  and  comfort  of  the  civilized  world,  while,  on  the 
other  hand,  if  the  pelagic  hunting  of  this  animal  is  to  continue,  and  the  barbarous  practice 
of  killing  the  mother  seal  with  her  unborn  young,  or  when  she  is  rearing  it,  is  to  go  on,  it 
will  be  but  a  very  short  time  before  the  fur  seal  will  practically  become  extinct  and  this 
valuable  industry  will  pass  out  of  existence.67 

Pribilof  Islands  Experience 

Secretary  of  the  Treasury  Charles  Foster  issued  a  “Letter  of  Instruction  to  Special  Agent 
Williams”  as  the  latter  prepared  to  undertake  his  position  on  the  Pribilof  Islands.  Excerpts 
from  Foster’s  letter  provide  some  insight  into  the  critical  comments  in  Williams’  annual 
reports  on  the  situation  of  the  islands’  Native  population. 

Mr.  Nettleton,  one  of  the  Treasury  agents  for  the  islands  . . .  will  be  accompanied  by 
Mrs.  Nettleton,  who  goes  to  teach  the  school  upon  the  island  where  her  husband  may  be 
stationed. 

Mrs.  Nettleton  will  accompany  her  husband,  and  you  are  hereby  directed  to  place  her  in 
charge  of  one  of  the  schools,  and  to  determine  with  the  company,  a  fair  compensation 
for  her  services. . . .  The  schools  will  be  maintained  from  September  1  to  May  31,  and  be 
open  for  five  days  in  a  week. ...  It  will  be  the  principal  duty  of  the  teacher  to  instruct  the 
children  in  acquiring  a  knowledge  of  the  English  language.  Russian  is  not  to  be  taught  in 
the  schools,  and  the  church  officers  must  be  restrained  from  interfering  with  the  children 
in  acquiring  a  knowledge  of  English,  and  should  be  advised  that  they  will  only  do  harm  if 
they  attempt  to  thwart  the  purpose  of  the  Government  in  having  the  children  educated  in 
the  language  of  the  country. 

You  will  endeavor  to  secure  the  good  will  and  confidence  of  the  native  inhabitants  of  the 
islands,  and  advise  them,  whenever  practicable,  of  their  rights  and  duties  as  American 
citizens,  and  by  proper  means  try  to  increase  their  friendship  for  the  Government  and  the 
people  of  the  United  States. 

The  care  and  welfare  of  the  natives  are  matters  which  should  receive  your  careful  attention, 
and  among  your  most  important  duties  is  the  insistence  that  the  North  American 
Commercial  Company  shall  fulfill  all  the  obligations  of  their  lease  toward  these  people.  The 
Government  maintains  a  protectorate  over  them,  and  they  look  to  its  agents  to  see  that 
their  employers,  the  lessees,  carry  out  in  good  faith  all  they  promise.

The  question  of  the  depopulation  of  the  islands  of  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  is  a  serious  one 
and  demands  attention.  Through  some  false  notions,  said  to  have  been  inculcated  among 
the  natives  by  the  church  authorities  on  the  islands,  they  are  not  permitted  to  intermarry 
if  there  is  between  them  the  remotest  degree  of  consanguinity,  and  even  the  relation  of 
godfather  or  godmother  is  held  to  be  sufficient  to  prevent  a  union.  As  the  regulations 
prevent  any  male  person  from  going  to  the  islands  to  reside  permanently,  there  is  a 
dearth  of  young  men,  and  the  young  women  are  more  apt  to  find  husbands  elsewhere. 

The  number  of  natives  on  the  islands  is  gradually  diminished  and  each  year  laborers  are 
taken  there  for  the  season  from  Unalaska  and  vicinity.  It  is  understood  that  residence 
upon  the  Pribilof  group  of  islands  is  considered  by  the  Aleuts  to  be  very  desirable  and 
to  insure  a  comparatively  comfortable  existence,  which  they  do  not  always  have  in  other 
parts  of  Alaska.  You  will,  therefore,  take  into  consideration  the  proposition  to  recruit  the 
permanent  inhabitants  of  the  islands  of  St.  Paul  and  St.  George  by  placing  upon  them  next 
year  a  small  number  (ten  or  twenty)  of  young  men,  or  transferring  to  these  islands  several 
families  in  which  are  a  number  of  young  men.  It  is  thought  that  there  will  be  no  trouble  in 
finding  suitable  persons  willing  to  go  there,  and  it  may  well  be  to  canvass  the  matter  among 
the  people  now  living  upon  the  islands  and  devise  some  way  of  making  the  selection. 

Care  should  of  course  be  taken  not  to  add  to  the  number  of  sick  or  infirm  persons  already 
there,  but  the  bringing  of  men  from  the  Aleutian  chain  to  remain  for  the  season  only  has  a 
demoralizing  effect,  both  upon  them  and  upon  the  permanent  residents  of  the  islands.68 

William  Williams  responded,  at  least  through  his  annual  reports,  regarding  many  of 
the  directives  in  the  Secretary’s  letter. 

The  care  and  welfare  of  the  natives  and  the  obligations  of  the  North  American  Commercial 
Company  ...  to  these  people  are  subjects  to  which  I  have  given  careful  attention.  The 
supplies  provided  by  the  company  for  the  last  year  and  kept  on  sale  at  the  company’s 
stores  were  of  good,  substantial  quality,  and  were  sold  at  very  reasonable  prices.  I  note  one 
exception  to  the  above  statement,  and  that  is  the  price  . . .  charged  for  coal--$33.60  per  ton. 

I  deem  this  to  be  exorbitant,  and  see  no  good  reason  why  the  natives  should  be  charged 
any  more  than  the  price  paid  for  coal  furnished  the  Government  house,  to  wit,  $15  per 
ton.  The  question  of  sufficient  fuel  on  the  islands  is  a  serious  one,  and  demands  careful 
consideration  by  the  Department.  The  lessees  are  required,  under  their  lease,  to  furnish 
80  tons  of  coal,  and  this,  with  what  driftwood  can  be  secured  and  the  blubber  taken  from 
seals  during  the  killing  season,  is  expected  to  provide  fuel  sufficient  for  about  60  families 
in  a  climate  where  it  is  necessary  to  have  a  fire  every  day  in  the  year.  The  driftwood  is  very 
hard  to  secure,  of  limited  supply,  very  poor  in  quality,  and  in  most  cases  is  thrown  upon 
the  shores  miles  from  the  villages.  They  have  no  means  of  transporting  it  except  on  their 
backs  or  on  hand  sleds  drawn  over  the  crusted  snow  in  midwinter.  The  blubber  is  stored  in 
barrels  and  boxes  for  winter  supply,  and  in  a  short  time  becomes  rancid,  the  stench  arising 
from  its  use  permeates  every  part  of  their  dwellings,  and  is  unhealthy,  sickening,  and 
disgusting.  Other  fuel  should  be  substituted,  even  if  it  has  to  be  done  at  the  expense  of  the 
Government. 

Under  Department  instructions  of  May  21  last ...  I  increased  the  amount  of  coal  from 
80  to  160  tons,  giving  100  tons  to  natives  on  St.  Paul  and  60  tons  to  natives  on  St.  George 
Islands.  This,  with  what  other  fuel  they  have  on  hand,  will  make  them  fairly  comfortable 
for  the  winter.  I  would  recommend  hereafter  [that]  arrangements  be  made  by  which  the 
inhabitants  on  St.  George  shall  have  100  and  on  St.  Paul  200  tons  of  coal.  This  would 
require  220  tons  to  be  furnished  by  the  Government  in  addition  to  the  80  tons  furnished  by 
the  company,  and  would  give  5  tons  to  each  familyT 

Williams  argued  in  his  1891  and  1892  annual  reports  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury 
that  the  education  of  the  Native  children  paid  for  by  the  lessees  was  wholly  inadequate. 

Especial  attention  is  invited  to  the  schools  on  the  seal  islands.  They  have  been  in  operation 
over  twenty  years,  and  yet  they  have  not  succeeded  in  teaching  a  pupil  to  read  or  write 
a  sentence  in  the  English  language.  Schools  in  charge  of  good,  competent  teachers,  who 


631 


Pribilof  Islands:  The  People 


have  other  qualifications  than  those  of  being  bookkeepers  or  seal  clubbers,  should  be 
insisted  upon  by  the  Department,  and  the  school  season  should  be  changed  from  the 
short,  cold,  dark,  and  blustering  days  of  winter,  when,  on  account  of  the  inclemency  of  the 
weather,  the  school  has  to  be  discontinued  for  days  at  a  time,  to  the  more  pleasant  months 
of  summer.  Radical  changes  are  absolutely  necessary  in  these  respects  if  it  is  the  desire 
of  our  Government  to  civilize,  educate,  and  improve  this  people.  That  these  people  are 
quick  to  learn  and  susceptible  to  rapid  improvement  is  demonstrated  in  the  charity  school 
at  Unalaska,  conducted  by  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Tuck.  Six  of  the  most  promising  orphans  on  the 
islands  were  sent  there  in  September,  1890,  and  I  found  on  visiting  the  school  this  year  that 
they  could  talk  the  English  language  quite  fluently  and  read  and  write  quite  intelligently. 

The  teachers  as  well  as  the  physicians  should  be  employees  of  the  Government. ...  0 

The  lessees  complied  with  their  contract  and  furnished  teachers  for  the  length  of  time 
required,  but  so  far  as  producing  favorable  results  is  concerned  it  was  a  waste  of  time  and 
money,  and  so  it  will  be  as  long  as  the  present  condition  exists.  When  the  time  arrives  that 
these  children  can  be  placed  under  faithful  Christian  teachers  who  will  teach  them  habits 
of  industry  and  morality,  and  under  these  conditions  the  blessing  of  home  and  home  life, 
then  may  we  look  for  gratifying  results,  but  not  before.  A  practical  demonstration  of  this  is 
to  be  seen  at  the  native  school  at  Unalaska  presided  over  by  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Tuck.71 

The  native  priests  can  neither  speak  nor  write  a  word  of  English,  and  it  would  seem  as  if  the 
Greek  Church  was  opposed  to  that  language  being  spoken  on  these  islands,  for  they  persist 
in  sending  priests  to  the  islands  who  can  speak  the  Russian  language  only.  While  there  is  no 
disposition  on  my  part  to  interfere  with  religious  worship,  I  submit  the  suggestion  that  the 
authorities  of  the  Greek  Church  be  required  to  send  to  the  islands  only  such  priests  as  are 
capable  of  conducting  their  church  services  in  the  English  language.72 

Education  for  the  islands’  children,  especially  in  regard  to  their  learning  English, 
would  be  a  concern  for  a  long  time. 

In  the  past  they  have  been  cared  for  very  much  as  an  animal  would  be  cared  for  by  its 
owner.  Their  physical  necessities  have  been  in  the  main  fairly  well  supplied,  but  their 
moral,  social,  and  civil  rights  have  been  wholly  ignored,  and  they  have  been  treated  more 
like  beasts  of  burden  and  slaves  than  as  American  citizens.  Had  a  policy  of  kindness  to  the 
native  man  and  protection  to  his  wife  and  daughter  been  pursued  in  the  past  we  would, 
no  doubt,  find  them  much  further  advanced  in  civilization  and  a  much  more  healthy  and 
useful  people;  and  while  there  has  been  considerable  improvement  in  many  respects  during 
the  last  year  over  what  it  must  have  been  but  a  short  time  previous,  still  there  is  need  of 
a  decided  stand  to  be  taken  by  the  Government,  [against]  who  [ever]  is  insubordinate  or 
who  violates  the  laws  of  decency,  or  in  any  way  interferes  with  the  civil  rights  of  the  natives. 

I  find  these  people  civil,  obedient,  kind,  and  easily  governed,  and  any  system  of  labor  or 
government  which  tends  to  degrade  their  family  relations  or  takes  away  or  destroys  their 
rights  as  American  citizens  ought  not  to  be  tolerated.73 

Williams  also  responded  to  Secretary  Foster’s  expression  of  concern  over  depopula¬ 
tion  and  the  islands’  workforce. 

The  gradual  decrease  of  population  on  the  islands  of  St.  George  and  St.  Paul  is  a  subject 
to  which  I  have  given  careful  consideration.  Owning  to  the  limited  catch  this  year  and 
the  unfavorable  opportunity  for  those  already  upon  the  islands  to  earn  enough  to  support 
themselves,  I  did  not  deem  it  advisable  to  encourage  immigration. 

One  of  the  customs  of  the  church  authorities  on  these  islands  is  to  prohibit  any  of  its 
followers  to  intermarry  if  there  is  the  remotest  degree  of  consanguinity,  and  even  the 
[relationship]  of  godfather  or  godmother  is  held  to  be  sufficient  to  prevent  a  union. 

Consequently  I  found  most  of  the  young  people  on  the  islands,  of  suitable  age,  prevented 
from  marrying  on  account  of  relationship.  Hygienic  and  sanitary  laws,  religious  customs, 
and  civil  privileges,  all  enter  into  this  question,  and  require  good  judgment  in  arriving

at  a  wise  conclusion.  I  conferred  with  the  natives  on  the  subject  and  suggested  certain 
conditions  whereby  permanent  residents  might  be  brought  upon  the  islands,  and  it 
apparently  met  their  approval,  but  it  further  developed  the  fact  that  the  practice  of 
bringing  people  from  Unalaska  or  any  other  place  to  work  during  the  sealing  season  has  a 
demoralizing  effect  upon  the  native  inhabitants  and  should  never  be  permitted  under  any 
circumstances.74

David  Starr  Jordan  quoted  Williams  on  the  direct  effects  of  pelagic  sealing: 

Mr.  Williams  and  his  assistants  reached  the  conclusion,  true  beyond  all  question,  that  “the 
seals  were  decreasing  very  rapidly,  and  that  the  cause  of  their  decrease  was  pelagic  or  deep- 
sea  hunting.”  “I  am  convinced,”  he  says,  “that  the  conclusion  arrived  at  is  the  correct  one, 
and  any  attempt  to  make  it  appear  to  be  due  to  other  causes  is  not  warranted  by  the  facts.” 

The  many  subsequent  investigations  have  only  confirmed  this  just  conclusion,  and  it  is  the 
essential  fact  in  the  whole  fur-seal  controversy.  It  is,  moreover,  one  which  every  British 
discussion  of  the  subject,  of  whatever  grade,  has  persistently  avoided.75 

In  the  spring  of  1892,  during  Williams’  tenure,  the  Bering  Sea  Arbitration  Hearings 
were  in  progress  and  the  United  States  Treasury  was  gathering  documentation  to  support 
its  case  before  the  hearing  committees  in  Paris.  Joseph  Stanley-Brown  had  been  assigned 
as  Special  Treasury  Agent,  with  Clerk  Assistant  Harry  D.  Chichester,  to  compile  maps, 
photographs,  and  other  data  for  government  authorities  in  Washington.  Williams’  role 
was  to  administer  oaths,  using  his  authority  under  section  1976,  Revised  Statutes  of  the 
United  States,  and  to  collect  testimonials  from  certain  people  on  St.  Paul  Island.  On  May 
30,  1892,  he  began  gathering  information. 

I  called  the  oldest  and  most  prominent  men  together  and  explained  how  their  affidavits 
should  be  made,  and  the  necessity  that  they  should  tell  the  whole  truth  and  only  the  truth 
as  they  know  the  facts.  Simeon  and  Antone  Meliviedoff  (sic)  very  kindly  agreed  to  assist  in 
the  work  of  taking  affidavits.76 

Williams  deposed  the  following  people  on  St.  Paul  Island  (all  spellings  of  names  are  as 
written  by  William  Williams):  Kerrick  Artomanoff,  Native  Chief  of  St.  Paul  Island;  Milton 
Barnes,  special  employee  of  the  U.S.  Treasury;  Karp  Buterin,  Head  Chief  in  charge  of  seal 
drives;  John  Fratis,  resident  and  employee  of  the  North  American  Commercial  Company 
(NACC);  Aggie  Kushin,  assistant  priest  and  employee  of  NACC;  Jacob  Kotchooten, 
Native  sealer;  Nicoli  Krukoff,  Native  employee  of  NACC;  Anton  and  Simeon  Melovedoff; 
Neon  Mandregin;  Apollon  Borudakaffsky;  J.  C.  Redpath;  C.  L.  Fowler;  and  J.  C.  S.  Akerly. 
Portions  of  some  of  their  testimonials  are  presented  throughout  this  book.

'  nble  investments,  due  lo  the  fact  that  they  are  the  breeding  grounds 
Of  the  fur  seat.  And  he  intends  lo.  keep  the  Investment  safe.  Strict 
regulations  are  in  force  in  the  scaling  industry,  and  even  tourists 
are  forbidden  from  visiting  the  islands.

(p4). 


Right:  “This  Curious  World”  by  William  Ferguson,  an  Editorial  cartoon  which  appeared  as  a 
Newspaper  Enterprise  Association  (NEA)  item  on  Feb.  18-19,  1938,  in:  Ironwood  Daily  Globe, 
Ironwood,  MI  (p.  4);  Clearfield  Progress,  Clearfield,  PA  (p.  3);  Modesto  Bee  Herald  News,  Modesto,  CA 
(p.  8);  Yuma  Daily  Sun,  Yuma,  AZ  (p.  6). 


William  Ferguson  (1900-1986)  was  a  farm  boy  from  McPherson,  Kansas  who  used  humor  and  wit  as 
a  cartoonist  to  depict  the  problems  facing  Midwest  farmers  and  nature  within  the  United  States.  At  age 
18  he  began  art  instruction  under  editorial  cartoonist  Carey  Orr  and  Carl  Ed  at  the  Chicago  Academy 
of  Fine  Arts.  Ferguson  started  with  the  art  staff  at  the  Chicago  Tribune  in  1920,  but  a  decade  later, 
while  he  was  with  the  NEA  Service,  his  own  comic  strips  appeared  in  mid-west  farm  dailies;  he  lived  in 
Omaha,  Nebraska  with  his  wife  Mildred  Evans  Roberts,  also  from  McPherson,  Kansas.  Ferguson  was 
the  creator  o/Glen  Forrest  (nature  series  taken  from  his  life  near  Colorado’s  Rocky  Mountain  National 
Park);  Catesby  (gag  strip  with  a  nature  angle);  This  Curious  World  (strange  nature-facts  feature);  The 
Beekisns  (about  a  farm  family,  it  ran  50  years  in  farming  publication  Drover’s  Journal,).  “Ferguson  was 
a  naturalist  and  international  lecturer  for  the  National  Audubon  Society  . . .  He  owned  some  farmland 
in  western  Kansas.  That  kept  him  in  touch  with  what  was  important  to  farmers,”  said  his  nephew,  re¬ 
tired  attorney  Ward  Ferguson  of  McPherson,  to  Lauretta  McMillen  in  1986.  [McMillen,  Lauretta,  staff 
writer  “Obituaries!’  Witchita  Eagle,  Witchita,  KS,  June  26,  1986,  p.  2]  Other  sources  for  this  Ferguson
