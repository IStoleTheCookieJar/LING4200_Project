For the September 1977 issue, PLayeoy took its “never-ending search for truth, beaut alin 
American way” to college campuses for the first time. Photographer David Chan's inaajguletomeot Big 
Ten universities proved successful and launched another signature pLayeoy feature. In the years since, 
we ve paid visits to our country’s other institutions of higher leaguing, from the PaijiiliielO Conferences 
to the Atlantic Coast Conference and everywhere In between. Weve mgt Red Raidersand Blue Devils 
Nittany Lions, Tigers and Bears. This Playboy Special Collectors Edition Is a celebration of our 
decades spent going back to schao! and the coeds everyone wanted to sifMext to in the lecture hall.
