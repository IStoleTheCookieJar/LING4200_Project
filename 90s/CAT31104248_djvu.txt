Pesticides used improperly can be injurious to human beings, animals, 
and plants. Follow the directions and heed all precautions on labels. Store 
pesticides in original containers under lock and key—out of the reach of children 
and-animals—and away from food and feed. 








Apply pesticides so that they do not endanger humans, livestock, crops, 
beneficial insects, fish, and wildlife. Do not apply pesticides where there is 
danger of drift when honey bees or other pollinating insects are visiting plants, 
or in ways that may contaminate water or leave illegal residues. 

Avoid prolonged inhalation of pesticide sprays or dusts; wear protective 
clothing and equipment, if specified on the label. 

If your hands become contaminated with a pesticide, do not eat or drink 
until you have washed. In case a pesticide is swallowed or gets in the eyes, 
follow the first aid treatment given on the label, and get prompt medical 
attention. If a pesticide is spilled on your skin or clothing, remove clothing 
immediateiy and wash skin thoroughly. 






































i 





NOTE: Some States have restrictions on the use of 
certain pesticides. Check your State and local regula- 
tions. Also, because registrations of pesticides are under 
constant review by the U.S Environmental Protection 
Agency, consult your local forest pathologist, county 
agriculture agent, or State extension specialist to be sure 
the intended use is still registered.

FOREWORD 


Program WIND (Winds In Non-uniform Domains) was a joint meteorological research 
effort by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, the U.S. Army 
Dugway Proving Ground and the U.S. Army Atmospheric Sciences [ober ateey. Field 
studies .were conducted in northern California during 1985 and 1987 to collect 
data for meteorological and spray dispersion model development and evaluation. 
As part of Program WIND, cooperation between the Forest Service and Dugway 
Proving Ground resulted in the advancement of the FSCBG (Forest Service, 
Cramer, Barry, and Grim) aerial spray deposition, drift and dispersion model 
from a research tool to an operational model. The work described in this 
report was sponsored by the Forest Service as part of the Program WIND 
cooperative effort.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 


The first phase of program "Winds In Nonuniform Domains" (WIND) was 
performed jointly by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest 
Service and the United States Army at several sites in northern California 
from May through July of 1985. A specific objective of the Forest Service in 
this continuing program is to collect sufficient data on aircraft wake 
behavior over flat and moderately complex forest and rangelands to permit 
evaluation and improvement of selected spray dispersion models. These models 
include AGDISP (AGricultural DISPersal) (Ref. 1) and FSCBG (Forest Service 
Cramer-Barry-Grim) (Ref. 2). These initial tests provided extensive wake data 
over reasonably flat brushland and within two types of forest canopies. 
Preliminary test results and a data reduction algorithm for interpreting the 


data are presented in a previous report covering this test (Ref. 3). 


Three significant recommendations were made as a result of these first 


series of tests, with regard to future tests in program WIND: 


1) The propeller anemometers located on the instrumentation 
grid should be oriented vertically, since horizontally 
oriented anemometers are influenced by ambient (generally 
horizontal) crosswind effects that cannot be easily removed 


when analyzing the data for the location of the aircraft 


vortices. 


2) The instrumentation grid itself should be extended laterally 
to permit wake tracking for a longer period of time, since 
the data reduction algorithm loses its ability to track the 
aircraft vortices once one of the vortices moves beyond a 


tower grid end. 


3) A longer sampling time should be used to track the vortices, 
since, with wider spaced towers, the aircraft vortices are 
expected to remain within the instrumentation grid beyond 
the 25 to 35 seconds of data observed in the first series of 


tests. 
i=l 


These recommendations were all implemented in the second series of tests 
for EMCOT (Event Modeling for COmplex Terrain), preliminary results of which 


are presented in this report. 


1.2 Program Description 


The EMCOT program extended data collection to hilly terrain, in an effort 
to obtain meteorological and dispersion measurements which can be used to 
validate the EMCOT model. Complex terrain presents its own unique set of 
problems due to downslope and upslope drainage winds, and the complicated 


influence and consequence of surface layer effects. 


The second series of WIND tests was performed in late April and early May 
of 1986, at a site in the Sierra Nevada foothills near Red Bluff, California 
(Section 2). A line of ten towers with three levels of anemometers was 
erected near the bottom of a gully in a cleared area between two ridges. Data 
was collected during several aircraft runs each morning. Data involved 
flyovers of a C-130 transport plane and a Bell 206B JetRanger perpendicular to 
the tower grid. Measuring equipment and data acquisition are the same as in 
the previous tests (Section 3). Following a standard test procedure each day 
(Section 4), a full test matrix of 49 tests was conducted over a twelve-day 


period (Section 5). 


1.3 Data Reduction Procedures 


Two sets of data reduction are presented in this report. Turbulence 
levels were recorded by sampling two UVW anemometer sets at one-second 
intervals during each test day, and recording the data on floppy diskettes for 
later analysis (Section 6). The bulk of the data from vertically oriented W 
anemometers were interpreted using the numerical algorithm developed in the 


previous work (Section 7). 


1.4 Conclusions and Recommendations 


The major conclusions and recommendations from this second study are as 


follows: 


fh) Even with the presence of downslope winds, the anemometer 
tower grid with vertical anemometers, spaced more widely 
apart, allowed for the accurate tracking of aircraft 
vortices for a much longer time than occurred during the 
first series of tests. A tower configuration of this nature 
should be very beneficial in future aircraft wake detection 
systems. In some cases, the preliminary results indicate 
that vortices were tracked up to 120 seconds after entering 


the tower grid. 


2) A comparison of velocity traces from this test with traces 
from Chico and Foresthill shows that the current experiment 
produces noisier signals. It is assumed that the presence 


of downslope winds is responsible. 


3) Surface winds above the tower grid played a significant role 
in altering the motion of the aircraft vortices. Although 
an attempt was made to account for apparent near-surface 
winds by positioning the aircraft flyover location, six of 
the 26 card deposition runs did not yield usable preliminary 
data. In these cases the vortices were swept away from the 
instrumentation grid before any sensors detected then, 
drainage winds severely distorted the vertical anemometer 
readings, or the existing data reduction algorithm was 


unable to locate the aircraft. 


4) Despite the above difficulties it is clear that the bulk of 
the test runs contain valuable aircraft wake data that, when 
combined with the first series of tests and analyzed in 
detail with the surface deposition data, will provide a 


significant database for model validation. 


1-3 


5) 


6) 


7) 


8) 


Consequently, it is strongly recommended that additional 


data reduction algorithms be investigated to quantify the 


behavior of aircraft vortices and near-wake effects, and to 
catalogue the expected motion of spray deposition over the 
terrain examined in this study and in the previous program 
WIND data study. An additional series of tests, including 
wake data and surface deposition, collection, should be 
undertaken in a coniferous forest to complete’ the 
experimental data package. A modification to the data 
reduction algorithm is expected to yield interpretable 
results from the test runs that could not be successfully 


analyzed with the existing algorithm. 


This completed data package, once reduced, should provide a 
large series of tests from which model validation in AGDISP 
may take place. Models of vortex tipping, helicopters in a 
low forward advance, and vortex dissipation above a smooth 
surface and within a canopy should receive attention during 


a detailed data analysis program. 


Addition of a canopy deposition model to AGDISP will 


complete all major code development. 


AGDISP may then be released as a predictive tool for spray 


deposition studies.

2- TEST EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES 


The aircraft and test site comprise the noninstrumented components of this 


test program and are described in this section of the report. 


2.1 Test Aircraft 


Four test runs were made over the instrumentation grid by a C€-130 on the 
first day of testing. Unfortunately, the current numerical algorithm was 
unable to locate vortex centroids during these runs. [It is anticipated that 
the C-130 wake characteristics will have to be included more carefully in the 
vortex algorithm to permit interpretation of the C-130 runs. Consequently, 
the bulk of data reduction will be confined to the helicopter flyovers that 


comprise the rest of the test flights. 


A Bell 206B JetRanger helicopter owned by Chuck Jones Flying Service was 
used for these test runs. The weight of the helicopter was approximately 
2100 lbs when fully loaded with water, with only 80 lbs of liquid released 
after completing the spray runs each day. The helicopter landed in a clearing 
after each run to receive further instructions. The spray material consisted 
of water, blue food coloring for traceability, and glycerine to retard 


evaporation of the water droplets. 


2.2 Test Site 


All tests were performed on a privately owned Jones Christmas tree farm 
approximately 25 miles east of Red Bluff, California (Figure 2-1). This area 
consists of a pair of ridges, between which runs a small stream which leads 
outward from the forrested end of the site through the test area. The ground 
was covered with seedlings approximately 2 ft high with a 5 ft spacing. The 


site was instrumented with program WIND towers for meteorological data. 


The ten 30-ft wake towers were located along the stream on an access road 
(Figure 2-2). A spacing of 20 ft was maintained between the towers. These 
wake towers had an east-west orientation where the upslope and downslope winds 
are parallel to the tower line. The towers were numbered 1 through 10 with 
tower 1 located on the east (uphill) end of the gully. The grade of the 
terrain was approximately 6.6% from tower 1 to tower 10. A small tent was 
pitched 20 ft perpendicular to the center of the tower grid to house the 


computer, power supplies and test engineer. 


On the north ridge, an orange marker was placed on the ground and lined up 
with an identical marker on the south ridge to guide the helicopter pilot over 
the appropriate tower. These markers were moved in response to _ the 
anticipated upslope or downslope winds to maximize the vortex penetration and 
persistence in the tower grid. A radar gun was operated from the south 


marker. 


The three Forest Service sample card lines were located north of the 
stream just below the north ridge crest, along the tower line, and south of 


the stream just below the south ridge crest. 


A tethersonde was operated by Nowcasting of Chico during spray tests. It 
was located approximately 150 ft downslope from tower 10 and measured wind 
velocity, direction and wet/dry bulb temperatures at various levels above the 


ground.

3. TEST INSTRUMENTATION 


The primary instrumentation consisted of a vertical grid of tower-mounted 
anemometers (shown previously in Figure 2-2), with the wake velocity signals 
sampled and recorded by a digital data acquisition system during the aircraft 
flight over the towers. UVW sampling was also done during the time between 
spray runs. Aircraft altitude was measured photographically. Ground speed 
was measured by Doppler radar and with photographs, and video recordings were 
taken of vortex patterns whenever possible. A more detailed description of 


the instrumentation system is given below. 


3.1 Anemometer Towers 


The towers used to mount the flow measuring instrumentation were 
telescoping masts which were extended to a height of 30 ft. The towers were 
placed in a single line along the stream at 20-ft intervals, yielding a 180-ft 
grid span. The anemometers were mounted vertically at the 10, 20 and 30-ft 
levels on each tower. In addition to the vertical sensors, two UVW sensors 


were mounted on tower 1 at the 20 and 30-ft levels. 


3.2 Anemometers 


Gill anemometers manufacturered by the R.M. Young Company, on loan to the 
U.S. Forest Service from the Transportation Systems Center of the U.S. 
Department of Transportation were used for this study. Four-bladed propellers 
(19 cm in diameter) were coupled with the DC generators to complete the 
anemometer. The anemometers were mounted on the towers oriented vertically in 


the plane of the tower to measure the vertical velocities of the wake. 


The anemometers were mounted on the masts at three heights. All masts had 
anemometers mounted at the three positions; however, due to the 32-channel 
limit on the data acquisition system, not all of the anemometers were 


monitored during the wake study. The anemometers were electrically connected 


3-1 


to the data acquisition system with filtering capacitors in accordance with 
the manufacturer's recommendations in order to attenuate the voltage ripples 
resulting from the brushes contacting different armature segments in the 


generator. 


3.3 Data Acquisition System 


The data acquisition system consisted of an IBM Portable PC with two Data 
Translation DT2801 auxiliary boards to sample and digitize 32 -channels of 
analog voltage signals from the anemometers (Figure 3-1). Sampling was 
carried out at a rate of 100 samples/sec (each anemometer was sampled every 
0.34 sec). The full scale analog voltages +1.25 volts were converted to the 
digital representations 0/4095, respectively, and stored in memorye A maximum 
of four minutes of data could be sampled continuously (before reaching memory 
limits) and stored for post test conversion to engineering units and further 


analysis. 


During the time between spray runs, the two UVWs were sampled at one- 
second intervals. This data was stored on floppy diskettes to be converted 


later to engineering units and one-minute averages. 


3.4 Aircraft Altitude Measurement 


The altitude of the aircraft as it passed over the grid of anemometers was 
measured by photogrammetry. A vertically oriented 35 mm Nikon with electric 
film transport took pictures of the aircraft flyby at the rate of 
six frames/sec. The apparent length of the spray boom was compared with the 
length in calibration photographs taken at known distance from the aircraft. 
The lateral position of the aircraft with respect to the towers can also be 


obtained from these photographs. 


3.5 Aircraft Ground Speed and Measurement 


Aircraft ground speed was measured using a U.S. Forest Service supplied 
Doppler radar speed gun. The operator was positioned at the south flight path 
marker. As the aircraft approached, it remained sufficiently far away so that 
the line of sight measurement was a satisfactory approximation of true ground 
speed. The calibration of the unit was checked with a tuning fork with 
frequency simulating a flight speed of 50 mph. This particular unit worked 
well except for the flights under 20 mph. 


3.6 Ambient Wind and Temperature Profiles 


Along with the UVW data obtained from tower 1, the Forest Service placed 
four towers (Campbells) at various locations around the test site to measure 
the UVW wind components at 3 and 10-meter heights. These Campbells also 
recorded temperature and heat flux and stored this information onto cassette 
tapes. Additionally, Atmospheric Sciences Laboratory (ASL) recorded extensive 


meteorological altitude profile data with their met towers.

4. TEST PROCEDURE 


Personnel arrived on-site prior to sunrise for each day of testing. The 
IBM Portable PC was connected to the anemometers and battery/generator power, 
and the data acquisition system (DAS) was checked out. Some of the mornings 
were very cold and errors occurred on the DAS. These errors were eliminated 


by allowing the computer system to warm-up for a few minutes. 


Once the system had successfully completed its checkout, the UVW sampling 
began at one-second intervals. During this time, Forest Service personnel 
placed the sampling cards out on the three card lines. MThe aircraft would 


also arrive and land in a clearing a few hundred yards north of the towers. 


The test coordinator would relay the desired flight conditions to the 
pilot who would then fly over the desired tower based on the crosswind data 
and placement of the north-south orange markers. The computer operator would 
initiate the data acquisition sequence based on visual contact with the 
aircraft. The test coordinator, standing at the south marker, would record 
the ground speed of the helicopter using the Doppler radar gun. The 
vertically oriented camera under the flyover tower would take a burst of 
pictures to record the height and position of each flyover. The computer 
would then continue to sample for approximately two minutes and the data would 
be stored onto a floppy diskette. The helicopter would land in the clearing 


and await further instructions. 


After the computer had finished storing the wake data, sampling of the UVW 
anemometers began once again. The sampling cards would be collected after 
they had dried, and new cards would be put in their place. This procedure 


took approximately 35 to 45 minutes per spray run. 


Depending on crosswind conditions the helicopter would be instructed to 
fly once again over the desired tower, and the procedure would be repeated 
about four times each morning. After the spray runs had been completed, two 
more helicopter runs were made without spray at various speeds for additional 


wake study data collection. 


During the entire testing period, the tethersonde recorded wind and 


temperature data at various heights above the ground. 


In several instances the anemometer data was reviewed on-site to report 
any anomolous behavior occurring during testing. After returning from the 
test site, all of the data was backed up and reduced for analysis. The wake 
data was sent to Continuum Dynamics, Inc., for processing, to locate the 
vortices using programs resident on Continuum Dynamics, Inc.'s Microvax II 
computer system. Midway through testing, one set of results was sent back to 
the test site, and adjustments were made in the flyover speeds of the 


helicopter.

5- TEST MATRIX 


The objective of the test program was to collect aircraft wake data 
(vortex trajectories) in a hilly terrain, while also through other 
experiments, collect surface deposition data. Most of the test runs were 
performed with a helicopter, flying a range of forward speeds from near hover 
to high forward advance. Although aircraft speed and height were also 
measured during the flyovers, these data were beneficial only in supporting 
the data reduction algorithm's choice of where the aircraft vortices first 


encountered the instrument grid.

6. UVW DATA REDUCTION 


Two UVW sensors were mounted on tower 1 at the 20 and 30-ft levels and 
sampled at one-second intervals when aircraft flyovers were not occurring. 


Table 6-1 summarizes the date and sampling times for the collected UVW data. 


Figures 6-1 to 6-18 display the wind velocity time histories for each of 
the sensors for each of the six days. These traces are one-minute averages of 
the one-second data. Gaps between the traces are the times when the spray 
runs were performed and the UVWs were not sampled. Several of the plots show 
an A/D sampling error, indicated by a significant spike in the velocity 
signal. When this event occurs, the digital acquisition system is reset to 
function properly. Only sixteen such events were encountered from over 


374,000 data points taken. 


The displayed data confirms the presence of a strong upslope-downslope 
east-west drainage wind typically between 1 and 3 m/sec, with the horizontal 
velocity vector shifting occasionally as much as 45° to the north-south. 
These velocity levels are large in comparison to the vertical W velocities 
recorded. The success in analyzing the tower grid data (examined in the next 
section) again illustrates the usefulness of collecting only vertical velocity 
data, even in a complex terrain. Discerning the “mean” lateral velocity and 
removing these values from the tower data to recover the position and strength 
of the aircraft vortices using horizontal anemometers would be a formidable 


task under the flow conditions studied during these tests.

7. TOWER GRID DATA REDUCTION 


Data reduction followed the technique outlined in the previous test report 
(Ref. 3), with the added complication of accounting for the slightly tipped 


ground plane. 
7.1 Flow Field Model 

The present model assumes that the aircraft wake may be represented by a 
simple vortex pair (with image vortices below the tipped surface, Figure 7-1), 
each vortex of which adds a velocity field of the form 

v = G/2TR 


where velocity magnitude 


< 
i} 


q 
" 


vortex circulation strength, and 


radius from vortex center. 


The total velocity at any point in the flow field (in particular, at a sensor 
location) in any run at any time, is then the algebraic sum of the velocity 


contributions from the four vortices acting on the flow. 


The location of the vortex pair is referenced to a coordinate system fixed 
relative to the tower grid (Figure 7-2). In addition to the vortex 


circulation strength already introduced, the other unknowns in the problem are 


h = the height of the vortex pair relative to the ground 
plane, 
s = the semispan of ‘the vortex pair (the half distance 


between their centers), and 


d = the offset distance of the aircraft centerline from the 
left-most (tower 1) grid centerline. 


7-1 


The procedure employed in Ref. 3 has been extended here to include the 
fixed terrain slope modification. Error minimization involving an iterative 
technique with influence coefficients was used to analyze the digitized 


signals from the 28 vertical anemometers for the duration of all 49 runs. 


7-2 Preliminary Results 


Figures 7-3 to 7-51 display the preliminary results of this test report. 
All 49 runs are illustrated by a contour plot of the interpolated vertical 
velocity data at 20 ft from the initiation of the test (time equals zero) to 
the completion of data collection, or 120 seconds, whichever came first. 
These contours are mapped with solid curves denoting positive (upward) 
velocity contours of 0.5 ft/sec, and dashed curves denoting negative 
(downward) velocity contours of -0.5 ft/sec. For the runs where the current 
solution algorithm could easily locate and identify a vortex pair path, an 
additional smooth curve of the variable d (illustrated in Figure 7-2) is 
superimposed on the contour plot (see for example Figure 7-8). This curve 
indicates the direction of travel of the vortex pair through the tower data. 
Runs that do not contain this curve have not yet been successfully reduced by 
the current solution algorithm (see for example Figure 7-3). Trajectory 


analysis is not possible at this time. 


Additional sets of figures are included in the cases where the vortex pair 
path has been identified (see for example Figure /7-8b). These curves 
_summarize the predicted horizonal and vertical positions of the vortex pair, 
and its predicted circulation strength. The horizontal positions are for the 
right vortex (the sum of variables d and s illustrated in Figure 7-2) as a 
solid curve, and the left vortex (the difference of variables d and s in 
Figure 7-2) as a dashed curve. The vortical positions are a plot of the 
variable h in Figure 7-2. The circulation G is in the units of £t2/sec. 
When the radar gun gave the flight speed of the helicopter, the computed 
steady state value of the circulation strength is also shown by a heavy solid 


line. 


As in the previous tests, the numerical algorithm does a good job of 
locating and following the vortex pair as it traverses the tower grid. The 
algorithm seems to fail whenever one of the vortices moves sufficiently off 
the end of the tower grid. The common signature of the vortex pair is a 
region of negative velocity (dashed contours) with positive velocity (solid 


contours) on either side. 


When the velocity data is mostly of one sign (either positive or 
negative), the present numerical algorithm is not structured to resolve the 
vortex pair path. The algorithm is also inadequate when the velocity levels 
are low (below 40.5 ft/sec). In this study no attempt was made to improve the 
numerical algorithm over the algorithm developed in Ref. 3 other than to 
include the simple terrain effect. One result of the preliminary examination 


is the cataloguing of several possible code enhancements. 


Of the runs that were not reduced by the current algorithm, it is 
anticipated that all or part of the following runs can be reduced once the 
numerical algorithm has been modified: runs 1, 4, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 38. 
This will leave a total of 11 runs (out of 49) or 2 card runs (out of 26) that 
do not appear to be reduceable. Principally, the vertical velocity profiles 
become so random that an expected vortex pair path cannot even be hand-drawn 
through the contour data. This breakup in the velocity profiles could 
possibly be attributed to intermittent drainage winds. In only a few cases 
(for example Figure 7-29, run 27) is it clear that the vortex pattern missed 
the anemometers. In many of the successful runs (for example Figure 7-42, run 
40) the careful placement of the helicopter was necessary because the locally 
prevailing crosswinds quickly moved the vortex pair across the anemometer 


grid. 


That potential success is possible in the unresolved runs may be best 
illustrated by vertical velocity profiles for a run that was not resolved by 
the current algorithm. Figure 7-52 presents plots of the vertical velocity 
along the top row of sensors at four times. Clearly the vortex pair location 
is evident, although the current algorithm was unable to resolve the vortex 


pair path for run 4. 


Several of the noncard runs were for aircraft flight speeds and wind 
conditions outside Forest Service normal operating procedures. These tests 
were conducted to test the limit of the algorithm. Clearly, for the very low, 
near-hover helicopter speeds, the vortex pair algorithm should be modified to 


include helicopter downwash effects. 


Overall, the data appears to be less smooth than in the previous tests. 
Since the computer and tower anemometer systems are identical, it is safe to 
conclude that the environment during the tests was more active than at 
Foresthill and Chico. The predicted circulation strengths show more 
fluctuations than in the previous tests. Because of the structure of the 
numerical algorithm, circulation strength variations tend to reflect solution 


procedure inaccuracies with identifying vortex location. 


It is important to realize that the tower grid is positioned between 0 and 
180 ft along the horizontal scale, with the base of tower ] at the reference 
vertical height of 0 ft, and its top at 30 ft (see Figure 7-2). All 
helicopter flights were flown above the 30-ft level so as not to impact the 


tower grid.
