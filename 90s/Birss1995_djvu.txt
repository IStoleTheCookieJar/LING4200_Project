Abstract 


In 1913 the furore surrounding the Armory Show brought about important 
structural changes in the New York art world. Associates of Alfred Stieglitz’s “291” 
gallery, which had been the exclusive centre of modernist activity in the city, responded 
by publishing material in their magazine, Camera Work, that repositioned the group 
aesthetically and intellectually. The first chapter explains the often diverse contents of 
the quarterly with reference to concurrent changes in the public and market for modern 
art. The transatlantic affiliations of the “291” circle and the part these played in 


justifying and sustaining the group’s activities is also examined. 


Early in 1915 members of the “inner circle” at “291” attempted to meet 
continuing conditions of uncertainty with 291 magazine, an avant-garde journal based 
on Apollinairian models. The second chapter looks at how the promotion of “291” as a 
centre for the “avant-garde” involved the group more deeply in the business of art. 
Francis Picabia’s machine portraits, published in Nos. 5/6, are found to have validated 
commercial aspects of American culture for the group and to have allowed for the 
establishment of the for-profit Modern Gallery late in 1915. Sexual and gendered 
contents of 291 are also examined and are discussed in relation to issues of the public 


and business.

Introduction 


This study proposes to examine the activities of the artists and writers of the 
Alfred Stieglitz circle in the three years following the Armory Show, the large 
exhibition of modem art held in New York City in February and March of 1913. It will 
focus most specifically on 291, a magazine devoted to the most recent artistic 
tendencies published by the group in 1915 and 1916. In this period, Stieglitz’s “291” 
gallery, which had been one of the only centres of modem activity in the city, faced 
increasing competition from other venues that sought to capitalise on the notoriety that 
modem art had achieved as a result of the Show. In my thesis I want to look at how the 
Stieglitz group attempted to reposition the gallery in these changed circumstances, by 
means of exhibitions and other activities, but most especially through their publications, 
Camera Work and 291. I shall argue that material published in these magazines was 
selected with the purpose of attracting attention to the gallery in the art world and 
among the general public, with the hope that such attention might regain for Stieglitz 
and his associates the leadership of the modern movement in New York. Whenever 
possible, I want to show how editorial decisions met the exigencies of a specific 
historical situation, and to read the work published not so much for what it says about 
the art under discussion, but for what is revealed about the Stieglitz circle and the “291” 
gallery. I will pay especially close attention to those items that deal with the art public 
and with the business of art, two subjects that were of great concern for Stieglitz and 


his associates in these years. 


This period in the history of the Stieglitz circle has not been adequately 
examined in the literature.! Books and articles on the “291” gallery, many of which 


focus exclusively on Stieglitz himself, frequently provide little more than a bare outline 


of events, or fail to situate the group’s activities within the context of broader social and 
intellectual tendencies.2 Many of the existing accounts, moreover, betray the 


considerable influence of interpretations that Stieglitz and his followers themselves

placed on past events long after they had occurred.3 The period 1913 through 1916, 
which I want to examine in detail here, has generally been described as one of 
indecision in the activities of the circle, or as a time when the gallery abandoned its 
educational objectives to become more of an elitist centre devoted to artistic 
experimentation.4 While these points of view have some merit, they are, nevertheless, 
incomplete. Although Stieglitz and his associates did manifest considerable hesitation 
and uncertainty in this period, they did not, as I hope to show, give up their ambition to 
play a leading role in the New York art world. On the contrary, examination of Camera_ 
Work and 291 reveals that members of the circle showed considerable interest in what 
was going on around them, and made decisions based on their very pragmatic interests. 
These publications have, unfortunately, also been rather cursorily dealt with in the 
literature, a deficiency for which there is, perhaps, good reason. Both magazines 
published a notoriously eclectic variety of material, and it is often difficult to determine 
exactly what aesthetic and intellectual positions were being advocated. This tendency 
has led some historians of the period to dismiss Camera Work, and to a lesser extent 
291, as little more than measures of the aesthetic confusion that reigned in the Stieglitz 
circle.5 I hope that my approach, which involves the examination of the works 
published within the context of specific intellectual, and even commercial, situations, 
will help to make better sense of these magazines, and of the often abrupt changes in 
editorial direction. Commentary on 291, which is surprisingly limited considering the 
fame of the publication, suffers from the added shortcoming that this magazine has 
often been considered as part of, or as related to, the Dada movement.§ Studies that 
make this assumption have tended to focus on the “object-portraits” by Francis Picabia 
that appeared in 291 Nos. 5/6 (July/August 1915), and other works like them. While 
these items do bear some similarity to the later productions of Dada, work published in 
291 was, as I hope to show, undertaken in a quite different spirit and with other 


objectives in mind.7 By approaching this material with the aim of determining the

purpose that it served within the practical circumstances of 1915-16, I hope to account 
for its presence in the magazine without forcing it into conformity with tenets of 
movements with which it had little in common. In this thesis I also want to look at the 
striking sexualised and gendered contents of 291 magazine, the presence of which has 
often been noted but never adequately accounted for. Here, I intend to go into 
somewhat greater detail, to discuss sources and structure, as well as the ways in which 
this sexual discourse was related to other themes presented. In the course of my study, 
I will make use not only of the work published in the magazines themselves, but also of 
the large numbers of letters and other documents from the period that are preserved in 
American libraries. Examination of this material, which includes the dummies of an 
unpublished issue of 291 in the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., helps to shed 


considerable light on the editor’s intentions.8 I also want to look at those aspects of the 


correspondence that concem the personal motives and interests of individuals involved 


with the gallery. 


The “291” gallery itself was established in 1905 by Alfred Stieglitz and Eduard 
Steichen to serve as the exhibition venue for their camera society, the Photo-Secession. 
At that time, Stieglitz was already quite famous as a photographer and propagandist for 
photography as an art form. Beginning in 1907, however, he increasingly turned over 
the gallery (soon to be known by its address as “291”) to exhibitions of moder art, 
ostensibly with the purpose of providing his colleagues with examples of work from 
another medium. Soon, however, these exhibitions became an end in themselves, and 
between 1908 and 1912 the gallery showed, often for the first time in the United States, 
work by such major European artists as Cézanne, Matisse, and Picasso. Stieglitz’s 
magazine, Camera Work, was also increasingly devoted to discussions of art and 
aesthetics. Exhibitions at “291” were seen by a large proportion of the persons involved 
with art in New York City, and gained Stieglitz and his gallery a considerable fame and 


notoriety. A magnetic personality, Stieglitz soon attracted to himself a number of

disciples, including the American modem artists Arthur Dove, John Marin, and 
Marsden Hartley, whose work was also put on display. In the period 1913 through 
1915, Stieglitz’s work in the gallery was shared by a number of other individuals, the 
most important of whom was Marius de Zayas, a Mexican caricaturist and writer who 
became the resident theorist of modem art at “291,” and who was instrumental in 
organising some of its most impressive exhibitions. Other important gallery participants 
during these years were Paul Haviland, a Harvard graduate and art enthusiast, who was 
often Stieglitz’s mouthpiece in the “notes” published in Camera Work, and Agnes 
Meyer, a beautiful young journalist and collector of art who, like others, was attracted 
by the air of freedom and experiment she found at the gallery. By 1915 these three 
individuals had come to form something of a sub-group at “291” and in that year 
attempted to take the gallery in the more radical direction that they thought changing 
circumstances required. 291 magazine, largely put together under their direction, was 
the instrument by which they hoped to accomplish this task. In the course of their 
efforts, however, they managed to offend their mentor, Alfred Stieglitz, and by early 
1916 had left the “291” group. 


This thesis comprises two large chapters, each of which is divided into several 
smaller sections. The first chapter deals with the period March 1913 through December 
1914, the time when the structural changes caused by the Armory Show in the New 
York art world started to become painfully obvious to “291” insiders. This chapter will 
pay special attention to Camera Work and the use that was made of it by the group in 
their efforts to meet the challenges created by the changed situation. I will also look at 
exhibitions and other activities of the circle, including a trip made by Marius de Zayas 
to France in the summer of 1914, during which he established a personal and 
professional relationship with Guillaume A pollinaire that was to have considerable 
importance for the future. The second chapter will deal exclusively with 291 magazine, 
published by the group between March 1915 and March of the following year, and will

similarly endeavour to show how this publication was used to meet the practical 
exigencies of the period. Here, however, I will concentrate on those themes relating to 
the public and business that so concerned “291” insiders, as well as on the 
aforementioned sexual and generative imagery. Special attention will also be paid to the 
famous Picabia machine drawings in Nos. 5/6, and to the accompanying essay by de 


Zayas.? 


I hope that, taken as a whole, my thesis will contribute to a better understanding 
of the role played by the Stieglitz circle in American modernism during the early part of 
this century, and that it will also provide further insight into artistic relations between 
the United States and Europe, a topic that has been the object of some attention in recent 
years.!10 More broadly, I hope to show how modernist groups were able to mobilise 
avant-garde art and ideas within a very specific context, often for quite practical, 
promotional ends that were unrelated to art as such. My thesis should also make some 
contribution to the understanding of modem art’s problematic relationship with mass 


and popular culture, and with its sources of patronage.!!

Notes 


1. Early twentieth-century American art has not been adequately studied in the first 
place. While quite thorough accounts of art and artists are available, such topics as the 
audience for art, the places where it was exhibited, or the cultural meaning of modern 
art and avant-garde activity in American society have hardly been touched upon. 


2. For a brief survey of this literature see Chapter One, note 1. 


3. Here I am thinking, in particular, of Dorothy Norman, Alfred Stieglitz: An American 
Seer (New York: Random House, 1973). Norman, who was Stieglitz’s friend and 
disciple in the 1930s, recorded many of his reminiscences and later published them in 
her magazine Twice-a- Year, as well as in the book. Because Stieglitz’s versions of 
events are often the most accessible, they have entered many of the standard accounts. 
Sue Davidson Lowe, Stieglitz: A Memoir/Biography (New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 
1983), suffers from a similarly uncritical attitude. 


4, William Innes Homer writes: “After 1913, 291 changed from a pioneering institution 
to a more exclusive center for aesthetic investigation. Stieglitz continued to think of 
“291” as a ‘laboratory,’ but it gradually became a kind of private club devoted to an 
artistic elite.” Homer, Alfred Stieglitz and the American Avant-Garde. (Boston: New 
York Graphic Society, 1977), 173. See also Lowe, Stieglitz, 177-83. 


5. In Timothy Rogers’ opinion, the “brief articles and maxims on aesthetics published 
in Camera Work, which depend greatly upon ‘intuition,’ ‘spirituality,’ ‘truth,’ and 
‘individuality,’ to convince, provide little evidence of consistent aesthetic principles 
underlying Stieglitz’s activities.” Rodgers, “False Memories: Alfred Stieglitz and the 
Development of the Nationalist Aesthetic,” in Over Here: Modernism, The First Exile 
1914-1919, ed. Kermit Champa (Providence: David Winton Bell Gallery, 1989), 62. 


6. For a review of literature on 291 see Chapter Two, notes 1-4. 


7. This is less of a failing in recent studies, but see: Dickran Tashjian, Skyscraper 


Primitives: Dada and the American Avant-Garde 1910-1925 (Middleton, Conn. 
Wesleyan University Press, 1975), 29-48.

women published in 291 magazine, and to discuss the part played by women artists and 
writers in the Stieglitz circle during these years. Unfortunately, limitations of space 
have forced me to curtail my ambitions. Some of this material has been incorporated 
into Chapter Two.

Chapter One 


After the Armory Show 


Between February 15 and March 15, 1913 a large exhibition of modern art took 
place at the 69th Infantry Regiment Armory in New York City that led to some 
significant changes in the structure of the New York art world. Officially entitled the 
Intemational Exhibition of Modem Art, but more often referred to as the Armory 
Show, it included over a thousand works, many of them by such leading members of 
European avant-garde movements as Picasso, Matisse, Picabia, and Duchamp. The size 
of the exhibition and the extreme novelty of much of the art on display caused an 
unprecedented sensation. Tens of thousands of people, many of whom had shown little 
previous interest in modem art, paid to see the Armory Show during its month long 
stay in New York, and many more attended the smaller exhibition that opened in 
Chicago and Boston, or read about the scandalous event in the newspapers. The Show 
also had the effect of kindling an interest in recent art among certain American 
collectors, and within a year a number of galleries specialising in modern work had 
opened to meet the new demand.! Before the coming of the Armory Show, this art had 
received a rather limited exposure in the United States, and was largely unknown 
outside a small group of artists and intellectuals. One of the few places in New York 
where the most recent art from both Europe and America could be viewed on a regular 
basis was the small gallery on Fifth Avenue operated by Alfred Stieglitz and his 
associates known as “291.” In 1908, Stieglitz, who was best known as a 
photographer, and his colleague of the time, Eduard Steichen, had become aware of the 
revolutionary changes that were taking place in European art, and had given over their 
gallery on Fifth Avenue, formerly devoted to photography, to exhibitions of modern 
painting and sculpture. In the five years before the Armory Show, Stieglitz had 
exhibited, often for the first time in America, art by Cézanne, Matisse, Picasso, and 
other Europeans, as well as that of such American painters as John Marin, Arthur 


Dove, and Marsden Hartley. Stieglitz’s journal, Camera Work, had increasingly been

devoted to criticism that attempted to put this new art into perspective.2 


Stieglitz’s activities, however, had had a rather limited impact on public 
awareness, partly because he lacked the necessary resources, and partly because his 
unique philosophy of art would not allow him to adopt frankly promotional methods. 
The “291” gallery itself consisted of two small rooms on the top story of a building, 
otherwise occupied by shops and businesses, that served both for exhibitions and as a 
meeting place for artists, critics, and others interested in the modern movement. The art 
that Stieglitz exhibited was shown because it had been recommended to him by people 
in closer touch with Europe, or because it contained something that he himself felt 
might be important. Stieglitz’s aesthetic criteria were rather vague, and selections seem 
often to have been made based on his intuitive sense that certain works possessed what 
he called “life,” or contained something that had not been seen before. Not 
surprisingly, “291” insiders frequently described the gallery as a “laboratory” or as a 


place where “experiments” were performed.3 The “experiments” conducted at “291,” 


however, were not always in the first instance artistic, but involved the people who 
walked through its doors. Although the exact nature of his work in this regard was also 
never very well defined, Stieglitz seems to have believed himself to be testing the 
validity of the art on view by means of public presentation, while, at the same time, 
gauging public vitality by the measure of its response to the art shown. He claimed that 
he could in this way come to some conclusions about both the importance of the 
modem art movement and the spiritual condition of the American people. By means of 
a close interaction with the public Stieglitz also hoped to have some effect on the 
American consciousness. A visit to “291” typically involved not only contact with 


“living” works of art, but also an elaborate discussion of their importance for the 


viewer with Stieglitz himself.4 


If Stieglitz’s aesthetic criteria were often rather vague, he left little uncertainty of

his opinion that there existed a deep animosity between true art and the materialism and 
greed that infected American civilisation as a whole. Modem art, he seems to have 
believed, was a manifestation of an evolving spirituality, allied with similar tendencies 
in other fields, that would eventually lead to an improvement in the human condition.5 
One of the primary aims of “291,” therefore, was to provide a place where Americans 
could have an opportunity to escape the effects of the “immoral American Goldhunt,” 
and breathe a purer air.6 Stieglitz’s colleague, Paul Haviland, writing on the occasion 
of the opening of the new premises of the Photo-Secession Galleries in 1908, described 
the effect that “291” presumably had on visitors: 


For half an hour, or an hour, or two hours you forgot all about New York, the 
rush of the subway and the struggle after the almighty dollar; and when you got 
back into the turmoil of everyday life, you felt that you had discovered an oasis, 
seemingly thousands of miles from the scorching struggle for life, where at 
your pleasure you could stop and refresh yourself in the quiet enjoyment of life; 
a quiet nook in a city of conflict, where you breathed an atmosphere of mutual 


helpfulness and understanding.’ 
Frequently in the pages of Camera Work one even encounters the curious notion that 
“the spirit of 291” is itself an entity of great value. Haviland, for example, in his notes 


on the Picasso exhibition of 1910, wrote that 


It is well to remember that the exhibitions held at ‘291’ are looked upon by 
those who arrange them as nothing more than a series of demonstrations, each 
demonstration being of unusual value in itself, but of greater value in its 


relationship to the underlying idea which has brought forth ‘291.’8 
The implication here, as elsewhere, is that the spirit in which “investigations” were 
conducted at “291” was actually of greater importance than the virtues or shortcomings 


of any individual exhibition. 


Although the art that Stieglitz displayed and the ideas he espoused were taken 
seriously by only a relatively small group of admirers, his isolated position in the New 
York art world had some advantages as well. Because there was no real market for the 


work he showed he had little competition from other galleries in his narrowly

circumscribed field, and could be sure of gaining the little business that was available. 
The relative absence of intellectual competitors, moreover, allowed him to do and say 
more or less what he pleased without fear of being contradicted. Any adverse criticism 
that he received from conservative quarters could even be interpreted as lending 
credence to his belief that modem art expressed and promoted a spiritual advance. But 
Stieglitz’s commercial and intellectual monopoly placed him in a rather precarious 
position as well. The elevation of his method of enquiry and “the spirit of ‘291’” to the 
highest places in his artistic philosophy created something of a void at the centre of his 
thinking that could leave him without clear intellectual or aesthetic direction. Moreover, 


his unwillingness to involve himself in the business side of art left the field open for 


those with fewer scruples.? 


Although Alfred Stieglitz and his associates at “291” did not participate in any 
significant way in the organisation of the Armory Show, the huge scale of the event and 
the furore it created were something that they could not ignore. The most significant 
aspect of the Show for Stieglitz, as for others involved in the New York art world, was 
the enormous amount of attention it attracted, not only from those interested in art, but 
also among the general public. At the outset, however, the exact implications of the 
success of the Armory Show were not very clear, and much speculation resulted. 
Interested observers were both delighted and perplexed by the very diversity of the 
reactions that the Show seemed to elicit, and by the variety of people who, even if they 
did not understand what they saw, found in the new art something worth noticing. 
Many came to scoff, but, according to contemporary accounts, others approached the 
art on view with a more open mind. Hutchins Hapgood, for example, a writer with 
Greenwich Village connections, wrote that 

to move about in those armory crowds and see the eager vital faces, the range of 

types, the curiosity, and the intelligence; the way in which people merged into 

the pictures, as it were, communicated with them, argued with them, compared 


life notes with them - this, indeed made one hopeful, made one expectant of all 
good things to come, made one trust democracy, and realise that people will 


take even the best, if there is life in it.10

Hapgood’s comments were, in part, the product of wishful thinking, but the statement 
is important as an indication of the high hopes aroused by the International Exhibition. 
Oscar Bluemner, an artist closely associated with Stieglitz, made some similar 
observations in an article for Camera Work that seems to represent “291” thinking on 
the Show: 


Of the two component parts of the American public that have seen and judged, 
namely the critics and laymen, so called, the latter have proven, on the whole, 
to be the more intelligent observers and contributors to the total opinion. 


This is the most curious and the most hopeful sign of art in America.11 


Only later did it become clear that the the enthusiastic public response to the Show had 
largely been provoked by its novelty, and that those most deeply affected by the art 
exhibited were a much smaller group of artists, intellectuals, and collectors. Initially, 


however, in the opinion of several well-informed critics, the Armory Show seemed to 


have created a vast, if rather incomprehensible, new audience for modem art.!2 


While, to begin with, the overwhelming success of the Armory Show did not 
cause Stieglitz to change his beliefs or his methods, it did unseat him from his position 
as the sole advocate of artistic modernism in New York. The Show’s organisers, the 
most important of whom were Walt Kuhn, Walter Pach, and Arthur B. Davies, had 
learned about the revolutionary developments in European art from Stieglitz and 
through personal contacts abroad, but had made arrangements for the International 
Exhibition largely without his help. Stieglitz was appointed to the organising committee 
but did little more than provide some art for display and prepare an article on the 
modem movement that eventually appeared in the New York American. Stieglitz, 
however, does not seem to have taken great offence at his relative exclusion. The 
commotion that accompanied large exhibitions was, he believed, not in keeping with 


the values he was trying to promote, and any attention they attracted to modem art 


would, he was sure, soon fade from public awareness.!3 Despite these beliefs, there is

some evidence that, as the proportions of the forthcoming event became clear, Stieglitz 
and his associates did experience a sense of threat that led them to justify their own 
more unobtrusive methods. The January 1913 issue of Camera Work, which appeared 
Just before the Show opened, published an open letter from Haviland to Stieglitz that 
defended him against charges levelled by Christian Brinton that, despite “291”’s 
efforts, the new art was still virtually unknown in America. According to Haviland the 
upcoming International Exhibition was itself evidence of the “monument built up stone 
by stone by the Photo-Secession.”!4 The International Exhibition, Haviland argued, 
would lack “291”’s quiet ambience and would only confuse the public with its size and 
novelty. A similar defensiveness is evident from the manner in which Stieglitz 
presented his ideas in the article written for the New York American. After explaining 
the origins of modem art in the quest for self-expression, Stieglitz went on to offer as 
the prime example of this attitude the work of John Marin, then conveniently on display 
at 291,. 15 


Stieglitz’s response to the International Exhibition, however, even after its 
importance for art in America had become clear, was surprisingly positive. His 
enthusiasm seems to have stemmed both from a belief that the Armory Show’s success 
had proved his claims that modem art was relevant for modem life, and from a 
perception that its achievement had, in large part, been the result of his own slow 
educative efforts. It seems likely, moreover, that Stieglitz also supposed that the Show 
had carried on his own work by means of some of his own methods. If accounts by 
Hapgood and Bluemner are to be believed, the vital and personal reactions of the 
“armory crowds” to the “life-messages” on view bore a remarkable similarity to the 
desired effects on the public after a particularly successful day at “291.” These 
similarities must have encouraged Stieglitz to think that the International Exhibition had 


been engaged in some of the same kinds of “experiments” with the public that he 


himself was carrying out.16 The apparent unsalability of much of the art displayed

appears also to have reinforced the assumption, already common at “291,” that modem 
art stood in opposition to the “commercialism” of the American mainstream. Writing in 
his Camera Work essay, Oscar Bluemner remarked that the success of the Armory 
Show had caused considerable discomfort among “those whose ease of mind is 
disturbed by the prospect of a possible loss of dollars through anything new,” by 
whom he seems to have meant the New York art dealers.17 Bluemner concluded that 
the Show was a further manifestation of the battle between “Idealism and Materialism,” 


the very conflict in which Stieglitz had been engaged for years. 18 


In the period immediately following the Armory Show, then, the success of the 
exhibition could be understood by members of the Stieglitz circle almost as yet another 
chapter in the history of “291” itself, and not as the first arrival of competitors for 
public allegiance. Many of the exhibitions and other projects that took place at the 
gallery in the months after the Show seem, in fact, to have been predicated on the 
assumption that “291” could capitalise quite unreflectively on the Armory Show’s 
achievement. Projects undertaken in this frame of mind included the preparation of a 
Special Issue of Camera Work that purported to demonstrate modem art’s connection 
with modern consciousness, the publication of a booklet by Paul Haviland and Marius 
de Zayas that explained art in sociological terms, and an ambitious pair of exhibitions of 
work by de Zayas and Picabia that seemed to begin where the Armory Show had left 
off. These exhibitions and publications were part of a concerted effort on the part of 
Stieglitz and his associates to establish “291” as the leader and mentor of what 
promised to be a much expanded modem art movement in New York. They seem 
founded on the premise that the success of the Armory Show was evidence of a general 
rise in spiritual awareness on the part of the American public, and that this new 
consciousness could be engaged by the further presentation of intellectually stimulating 


material.19 Enthusiasm at “291” for advanced art and its possible acceptance by the 


public were also greatly augmented during the spring of 1913 by the presence in New

York of Francis Picabia, the Parisian abstractionist who had come to the United States 
for the Armory Show, and who had quickly discovered “291” and the Stieglitz circle. 
Picabia, whose enigmatic art was among the most controversial in Show [Fig. 1: 
“Danses a la source I”], soon found himself in great demand as a spokesman for the 
modem movement and gave a series of lively interviews to the metropolitan 
newspapers. For his part, Picabia took a childlike delight in the mechanisation and 
frenzied pace of New York life. “Your New York is the Cubist, Futurist city,” he told a 
reporter from the New York American, “with its architecture, its life, its spirit, it 
expresses modern thought.”20 Interestingly, Picabia was also confident that, because 
America was so advanced socially and technologically, his art would find there the 
audience that it did not have in Europe: 


I have come here to make the Americans accept the new artistic movement in the 
same spirit as they accept political movements - movements which at first may 
have seemed antagonistic, but which the Americans, with their decided love for 


freedom of expression, then accepted broadmindedly in almost all fields.2! 


Picabia was equally enthusiastic about “291,” and, to Stieglitz’s great satisfaction, 


described him in the newspapers as “the man best informed of this whole revolution in 


the art of painting.”22 


Stieglitz was thus able to enlist one of the “stars” of the Armory Show, and an 
able spokesman for modem art, in the service of “291” even while the large exhibition 
was still in progress. Then, only two weeks after the Show closed, the gallery 
engineered another coup with an exhibit of a series of abstract watercolour sketches that 
Picabia had made in New York to convey his impressions of the city [Fig. 2: “New 
York”). Exhibition of Picabia’s work had the effect of linking “291” directly with some 
of the most notorious aspects of the Armory Show, and gave the impression that the 
gallery had managed to extract and summarise some of its most significant features.23 
Interestingly, although the works exhibited were some of the most completely non- 


representational that Picabia had yet produced, and were among the most hermetic ever

shown at “291,” the artist maintained that his art nevertheless had great relevance for 
the times. In the catalogue statement he prepared “for the benefit of the public that came 
to see his work,”24 Picabia proclaimed himself optimistic that his art would soon be 


understood by all: 


Art is one of the means by which men communicate with each other and 
objectivize the deepest contact of their personality with nature. This expression 
is necessarily related to the needs of the civilisation of the time. It has its 
conventions as has any means of expression. Its conventions are the limitations 
of the personality of the artist, a limitation which man tends to extend, as he 
tends to remove all limits to his perception....The laws of this new convention 
[abstraction] have as yet been hardly formulated but they will become 

gradually more defined just as musical laws have become more defined and they 
will rapidly become as understandable as were the objective representation of 


nature.25 


While Picabia’s statement was itself an outcome of the enthusiasm that the success of 
the Armory Show had generated, his lucid arguments for the ability of form to 
communicate ideas must themselves have provided great encouragement to members of 
the Stieglitz circle as they prepared to identify “291” even more thoroughly with the 
most recent tendencies in art and ideas. Picabia’s arguments suggested that even this 


highly abstracted art could bring about the desired rapport with the audience that, as we 


have seen, was so highly valued at the gallery.26 


The most important attempt on the part of “291” to capitalise on the sudden 
notoriety of modern art, however, was a “Special Issue” of Camera Work published 
over the summer. Although the volume focused on Picabia, the artist who most closely 
linked “291” with the Armory Show, its scope was broad, and articles published 
attempted to connect modern art with fields as different as sociology and the physical 
sciences. The presence in the volume of a large number of the writers from outside the 
circle, or who were new to Camera Work, seems to have been a deliberate attempt on 
Stieglitz’s part to swell the ranks of the “291”’s participants. Gertrude Stein, who led 


off the issue with a “Portrait of Mabel Dodge at the Villa Curonia,” was a writer of

stream-of-consciousness poetry living in Paris, albeit one very interested in art and 
artists.27 Immediately following Stein’s piece came an explanation of her work by 
Mabel Dodge, head of the famous Greenwich Village salon, where the topics of 
conversation were more often social and political. Other newcomers who contributed 
include Picabia’s wife, Gabrielle Buffet, who wrote an article on “Modern Art and the 
Public,” the chemist, Maurice Aisen, author of “The Latest Evolution in Art and 
Picabia,” and John Weichsel, a socialist whose essays on art would soon be a 
conspicuous feature of the magazine. The longest and most substantial piece published, 
however, was “Audiator et Altera Pars: Some Plain Sense on the Modern Art 
Movement” by Stieglitz’s artist friend, Oscar Bluemner, which, as has already been 
noted, attempted to establish the historical significance of the Armory Show itself. A 
series of reproductions, beginning with Cézanne and ending with Picabia, that made up 


a little history of modern art not unlike the one presented at the Armory, closed off the 


volume.28 


Inclusion of writers from such diverse areas of endeavour had the effect of 
suggesting to readers of the Special Issue that, in the aftermath of the Armory Show, 
“291” was at the forefront of a wide range of intellectual activities. This impression was 
further reinforced by the assumption, present in many of these essays, that modem art 
itself now led the way in modern thought. Mabel Dodge, for example, established a 
clear order of precedence between art and literature when, near the beginning of her 
essay, she declared that “Gertrude Stein is doing with words what Picasso is doing 
with paint.”29 In “Modern Art and the Public,” Gabrielle Buffet argued that modem art 
even formed the necessary counterpart to contemporary science. “The development of 
science,” she wrote, “has given us a new conception of life. It has given life new 
meaning.” 


We have gone past the first sensorial contact with the universe....We plumb to 
the depths, we pierce below the surface to grasp their quality, their essence, and 
in doing so an infinite world of new forms is opened up to us....In order that

art should express the complexity of this new state of mind it has to create new 
elements.30 


It is only through an abstract art, “the result of a necessary evolution,” that this complex 
state of affairs can faithfully be communicated.3! In “The Latest Evolution in Art and 
Picabia,” Maurice Aisen argued, in a similar fashion, that the modern art movement 
was related to a variety of social and intellectual changes. Recent developments “in 
ethics, in politics, in the community and in the individual” have gone so far as to create 
in some sensitive people a “sixth sense,” one “purely psychical,” that is related 

“not...to matter but to spirit.”32 According to Aisen 


It is with this psychical sense that we may be able to explain the art of Picabia 
and by it his work will no longer present a question for us but a palpable 


answer.33 


At the end of the piece, modem art is placed at the front of this psychical tendency and 
even identified as the harbinger of a utopian future: 


I fee] that out of this movement, because of the truth that all workers of today 
reflect the community of tomorrow, as painting grows in this direction, so will 
our morals, our understanding. Life will become more beautiful than it is today; 
will bring among us bigger ideals of life, pure ideals, deprived of materiality, 


making better the people....34 
“Evolution” and “consciousness,” used to describe prevailing tendencies in both art and 
society, are the words that appear most frequently in the Special Issue. The impression 
that the volume as a whole seems intended to create in the mind of the reader is of an 
ever more complex world whose rapidly changing nature can truly be known only by 
the super-sensitive mind of the modem artist. The volume suggests that readers of 
Camera Work, and visitors to “291” can participate in this project, even if their primary 


interest is not art at all. 
Predictably, the public to whom these essays were addressed, and which had 


become so important since the Armory Show, was also a matter of some concern in the 


Special Issue. Two attitudes toward the public can be identified, seemingly at odds, but

in fact mutually reinforcing. The first is characterised by a dismissal of any suggestion 
that artists should take popular tastes into account, or that wide public comprehension 

of art is even necessary. In “Modern Art and the Public,” Gabrielle Buffet writes that, 

when viewing a work of art 


the question...of whether one has or has not a merely sensuous pleasure ought 
not to impose itself at all. On the contrary one should try to suppress one’s own 


personality in order to understand that of the artist.35 


Art is not a “pastime,” she says, but 


a means by which men may communicate with each other and express the 
profound needs of their being, of their race, and of their epoch....36 


A second, more favourable opinion of the public, accompanied by a more generous 
attitude toward it, can be found in Maurice Aisen’s “The Latest Evolution in Art and 
Picabia.” That “the majority, the great majority of the lovers of art, are puzzled before 
the last work of Picabia,” is for him a problem that commands some attention.37 While 


he maintains that modem art is primarily for those with a developed “sixth sense,” the 
essay seems haunted by an awareness that if art is to contribute to psychic “evolution,” 
it must be able to communicate its intentions to a large proportion of its audience. Aisen 
is confident that a considerable part of the public does have the required abilities, and 
that Stieglitz and “291” will complete the work of the Armory Show: 


In some of Picabia’s studies for his future paintings, made here in New York, 
which have been exhibited at ‘291,’ especially the ones that express the 
emotions he received from the songs of coloured people, - he has 
communicated his sensations to many people, who had little or no emotional 
comprehension of his paintings exhibited at the International Exhibit held at the 


Armory.38 
Oscar Bluemner, writing in “Audiator et Altera Pars: Some Plain Sense on the Modern 
Art Movement,” is, if possible, even more sanguine. As we have seen, the fact that the 
paintings on view at the Armory had an impact on thousands of quite ordinary people 
seemed, for Bluemner, to speak of an untapped aesthetic capability in persons usually 
dismissed as the philistine masses. The challenge, as he saw it, was to create channels 


of communication with this “vital” public that bypassed such conservative critics as

Kenyon Cox and Royal Cortissoz.39 Not surprisingly, Bluemner agreed with Aisen 
that “291” was succeeding in this task with the Picabia exhibition: 


[Picabia’s] studies at 291 Fifth Avenue were in some ways, the very abstract 
and quintessence of what was new in the bigger show. Yet the new did not fail 
to be recognised, felt, discussed and, as a lesson and stimulation, appropriated, 
by a surprisingly large part of the public.40 


Although much of this faith in the public was wishful thinking on the part of 
writers with a considerable stake in “291” and the modem art movement, reiteration of 
these ideas in the Special Issue suggests that some members of the Stieglitz circle did 
believe them to be true. Attempts to introduce the subject of the public into the debate 
seem to have had a solid promotional purpose as well. Whatever the motives of 
individual writers may have been, the efforts made in the volume to take public 
objections to modem art seriously and to commend those willing to approach difficult 
art with an open mind, had the effect of putting a more inviting face on a rather 
forbidding subject. In the end, the contemptuous and the more considerate attitudes 
toward the public complemented one another. The former attitude indicated to readers 
that the task of understanding modern art was indeed difficult, but that through it one 
could possibly gain entry into an intellectual elite. The latter suggested that there was 
help to be had in the struggle to understand and that a substantial number of people had 
already been initiated. The double-edged thrust of the Special Issue was, in fact, 
summed up in an advertisement for Camera Work that appeared here for the first time 
and which was reprinted in all subsequent issues. The item, mainly intended to sell 
back numbers, began with a series of questions addressed to the reader: 


Are you interested in the deeper meaning of Photography? 
Are you interested in the evolution of Photography as a 
medium of expression? 
Are you interested in the meaning of “Moder Art”? aA 
Are you interested in the Development and Exposition of a living Idea? 
Are you interested in Freedom of Thought and Freedom in 


Expression?41

magazine, the ad declared: “Camera Work is published for those who know or want to. 
know.”42 Once again, the advertisement informed readers that “291” was the guardian 
of a desirable, though not very widely disseminated, body of knowledge that could best 
be acquired by means of the helping hand of the magazine.43 The advertisement also 
spoke of a hope, on Stieglitz’s part, that “291” would be able to make contact with a 
new readership even while maintaining links with the older photographic subscribers, 
many of whom were not very pleased with the direction that the magazine was 


taking.44 


Yet another response on the part of “291” to the expectations created by the 
Armory Show was a little book written by Marius de Zayas and Paul Haviland entitled 
A Study of the Modern Evolution of Plastic Expression, published by the gallery in late 
February, 1913. Haviland’s part in the collaboration seems to have been limited to a 
few anecdotes concerning Stieglitz’s activities at the gallery, and the ideas expressed in 
it are therefore mainly those of de Zayas. Although intended as yet another explanation 
of modern art for the benefit of the public, the book is nearly incomprehensible in 
places and was evidently written in haste. The publication date, February 26, suggests, 
in fact, that it was prepared while the Armory Show was still in progress, probably 
with the intention of involving de Zayas, the resident theoretician at “291,” in the 
unexpected public controversy concerning modern art. One of the most important 
members of the Stieglitz circle between 1913 and 1916, de Zayas was a Mexican-borm 
caricaturist who had moved to the United States in 1908 to avoid persecution in his 
native country. He was already quite well known in New York for his witty caricatures 
of society figures when he was invited by Stieglitz to exhibit at “291” in the following 
year. Through Stieglitz he became acquainted with the modern art movement, his 
knowledge of which was greatly increased by meetings with Picasso and other artists 


during lengthy stays in France.

De Zayas, perhaps because he was himself a relative newcomer to modem art, 
was very anxious to explain and justify its importance in historical and theoretical 
terms. In many respects, his concern for art’s relevance was typical of the Stieglitz 
circle, and was the result of an apprehension, already noted in the Special Issue, that 
modem art might not, in fact, have much to say to the majority of people. Not long 
before the Armory Show, in an effort to make the foundations of modern art more 
secure, de Zayas combined his knowledge of recent European art with his wide reading 
in contemporary anthropology and sociology to produce a coherent, if rather eccentric, 
philosophy of art that was articulated in a series of difficult articles for Camera Work.45 
The first of these theoretical articles, entitled “The Sun Has Set,” published in the July 
1912 issue, approached modem art as a social problem in need of conscientious 
examination. Why was it, de Zayas asked himself, that the most advanced civilisation 
in human history was producing art whose most conspicuous features were a wide- 
ranging eclecticism and a yearning for more primitive forms of expression?46 At this 
stage of his thinking, de Zayas argued that such self-conscious “rummaging about in 
ancient cemeteries” should be considered a sign of artistic and spiritual exhaustion.4? 
He concluded, however, that, when modem art was looked at in this way, it did take 


on some relevance, for it was shown to be an accurate reflection of disturbed modem 


times.48 


De Zayas seems soon to have realised that the rather conservative arguments set 
out in “The Sun Has Set” had led him into an intellectual and professional cul-de-sac. 
In two further essays, entitled “Photography” and “The Evolution of Form - 
Introduction,” both published in the January 1913 issue of Camera Work, de Zayas 
proposed a more innovative solution to the problem of modern art’s apparent lack of 
relevance. In these essays he argued that contemporary art did indeed have a deep 


connection with the present in so far as it followed the methods of science, the

paradigm of all worthwhile modern endeavour.49 Modem art, he now maintained, was 
only apparently primitive and eclectic. At its best, it used the systematic methods of 
science to explore the totality of known “Form,” whose full range had only recently 
been brought to light by the investigations of ethnology, and the abstract nature of 
which had been revealed by the example of primitive art:50 


The fact is that Form, in all its manifestations throughout the evolution of man, 
has never in the History of Art been fully understood until the present time. 
When the artist left the poetical conception of art and tumed to Ethnology in 
search of a new conception of Form, Art emerged from the mysterious 
atmosphere into which idealism had plunged it. The beautiful surface of beauty 
[sic] which inspired contemplation vanished and there remained, the powerful 
force which has compelled man to the plastic expression of thought. The Artist 
no longer wants to be mystified by mystery, but wants to be enlightened by 


knowledge....5! 


In de Zayas’ opinion, modem art, like modem science, was essentially an 
exploration of something outside the artist himself, and he is unwavering in his 
condemnation of all kinds of artistic subjectivism. The principal object of his scorn in 
this regard is “cosmic and metaphysical Art” that sought to communicate spiritual states 
by means of form.52 This kind of art, apparently that produced under the influence of 
Symbolism, is necessarily devoid of meaning because it attempts “to represent the 
irrepresentable and to limit the incommensurable.”53 De Zayas wants modem art to 
confine itself to what it does best, the systematic exploration of form by quasi-scientific 
means. Interestingly, as he makes his case for a scientific art, de Zayas seems even to 
go so far as to renounce “art” altogether in favour of something more akin to chemistry 
or physics: 


It was not until Art felt the powerful influence of Science that it awoke and 
broadened its horizon, calling to its aid the resources which science had 


accumulated. Possibly, this only means the absorption of Art by Science.54 


To draw a conclusion from statements such as these that de Zayas would prefer to 
exchange art for something more relevant would, I believe, be mistaken. De Zayas’ 


purpose, not very different from that of the writers published in the Special Issue, is to

make the foundations of modern art all the more stable by broadening its compass, 
albeit at the expense of some elements, such as the communication of internal states, 


sometimes thought to be intrinsic to it.55 


De Zayas and Haviland’s short book on the “Modem Evolution of Plastic 
Expression,” published at the time of the Armory Show, restated many of these ideas 
with little basic alteration, but with an odd inflection that probably had much to with the 
circumstances of the book’s production. Like other members of the Stieglitz circle who 
were struck by the overwhelming response to the International Exhibition, de Zayas 
seems to have been motivated by the event to pay somewhat closer attention to the art 
public. The book’s overriding deference to science, even more in evidence here than in 
the essays, suggests that it was, in fact, written with the curious, if rather skeptical 
Armory crowds in mind. De Zayas seems to have hoped that, if he could demonstrate a 
clear connection between art and science, he might be able to validate modern art at a 
time when it had much to gain but was still potentially vulnerable. In the booklet, de 
Zayas argued once again that what made modem art worthy of consideration was its 
relation to the reigning paradigm of knowledge: 


The artist in all times has been closely allied to the religious spirit of his time. 
When man worshipped the forces of nature the artist devoted himself to the 
representation of the forces of nature; when man worshipped beauty, the artist 
gave material representation to his conception of beauty. The religion of today is 
science, and the modem movement in art reflects this characteristic intellectual 


and analytical attitude of mind.56 


While the book exhibited much of the same double attitude toward the public 
found in the Camera Work Special Issue, in it de Zayas demonstrated a remarkable 
willingness to take public objections seriously. His adopted persona through much of 
the book is, in fact, that of an impartial and reasoned observer of recent developments 
whose only interest is to get at the truth of the matter. Interestingly, at some points in 


his argument, de Zayas even begins to distance himself from theories that he had

espoused in the past. Thus, with regard to modern art’s claims to scientific purpose, he 


asks: 


Is it worth while trying to get at truth through abstract and apparently 
incomprehensible representations of the investigations of the artist, or does this 
research belong to the strictly scientific men?...Have the modem artists 
expressed a truth or the truth or have they only tried to express the process of 
their investigation?57 


De Zayas’ own answer to this question would seem to be that yes, modem artists can 
get at the truth provided they follow de Zayas’ “scientific” prescriptions. But because 
the answer is not clear from the outset, the question, and others like it, begin to put de 
Zayas’ own ideas under examination from an apparently neutral point-of-view. 
Unfortunately, the number of critical positions begin to multiply to the point of 
confusion as he provides the reader with explanations of modern art that range from 
those provided by artists themselves to de Zayas’ own more qualified opinions.58 The 
variety of information included seems to speak of a deep anxiety on de Zayas’ part with 
regard to the security of the modern movement’s place in the art world and in the wider 
community. That art must have close connections with something outside itself is a 
dominant theme in the book. We are repeatedly told that “the artist being part of the 
community reflects the soul of the community in which he lives,” and are warmed that59 


in exclusive individuality the individual works with his own individual 
resources for his own individual self. The moment he excludes himself from the 


community, the community is excluded from his feelings.6° 


De Zayas’ other contribution to the activities at “291” in the spring of 1913 was 
an exhibition of his series of “abstract caricatures” on which he had been working since 
late 1912. De Zayas’ ambitions in these caricatures seem to be somewhat at odds with 
the skepticism he had shown towards the communication of subjective states by form in 
the essays, and their exhibition suggests that de Zayas was not, in fact, completely 
satisfied with the limits he had placed on modem expression. The abstract caricatures 


themselves are elegant linear compositions that sought to chart an individual’s character

and personal destiny by means of abstract shapes and mathematical symbols.6! Persons 
treated in this way included Alfred Stieglitz and Francis Picabia, the “291” insiders 
Agnes Meyer and Paul Haviland, and Theodore Roosevelt [Figs. 3-8]. According to de 
Zayas’ catalogue essay, the caricatures, when properly read, provide a more complete 
analysis of an individual life than is possible by means of more traditional methods of 
portraiture. Artists, he maintained, had been hindered in their attempts to portray the 
human spirit by the fact that they could not “represent materially something essentially 
immaterial.”62 As he had argued in his essays, de Zayas finds that an insurmountable 
barrier exists between the subjective state that is to be communicated and the plastic 
means of expression available. In an eccentric twist to his argument, however, de 
Zayas now argued that the use of mathematical symbols provided the solution to this 
problem. Because “mathematics are essentially symbolical,” they are able to represent 
such things as “psychological and metaphysical entities.”63 Abstract form, he now 


seems willing to admit, can also be used to delineate some aspects of a life: 


The technique of my procedure consists in representing: (1)the spirit of man by 
algebraic formulas; (2) his material self by geometric equivalents; (3) and his 
initial force by trajectories within the the rectangle that encloses the plastic 


expression and represents life.64 


De Zayas thus seems to have believed that, by the addition of mathematical equations to 
his work, he had solved the problem of the communication of spiritual qualities by 
means of art. He also maintained that, because the abstract caricatures dealt with 
something from outside the artist, they were, like all good modern art, essentially 
investigative in character. “They are not art,” he wrote, 


but simply a graphical and plastic analysis of individuals ....These caricatures 
are not the expression of my psychical self, but the intrinsic expression, as I 


perceive it, of the individuals themselves.®5 


The ideas set out by de Zayas in his catalogue essay are so bizarre that it has 


even been suggested that de Zayas meant the abstract caricatures as a joke, or as a satire 


of “plastic expression.”6 There is, however, no evidence to suggest that de Zayas

intended his work to be taken in other than a spirit of the utmost seriousness. During 
the summer of 1914 he showed the caricatures to prominent artists and writers in Paris 
and then, late in 1914, they were reproduced in Camera Work together with another 
serious explanatory essay.§7 I would suggest that the abstract caricatures are what they 
claimed to be, another proposed solution to the problems that de Zayas believed to be 
inherent in modem art, and that had precluded his full participation to this point. 
Exhibition of the abstract caricatures was probably encouraged by the excitement 
generated by the Armory Show, and by the vocal presence in New York of Francis 
Picabia, another artist who was attempting to transmit ideas by means of highly abstract 
work. The arguments set out in de Zayas’ catalogue essay were, in fact, similar, in 
many respects, to those made by Picabia in the essay he wrote for his own exhibition at 
“291.” Like de Zayas, Picabia professed to analyse objectivity by means of private 
symbols and to be able to communicate such information to another party, albeit with 
strictly plastic, not mathematical, means.§8 Picabia’s influence, then, appears to have 
allowed De Zayas, for a time at least, to regain his faith in art’s ability to deal witha 


greater variety of public concerns.®? 


De Zayas’ abstract caricatures and the accompanying catalogue essay placed 
difficult art and ideas before the public with the expectation that they would be accepted 
and understood by at least a portion of the audience. De Zayas’ exhibition, the last of 
the season, seems therefore to sum up the hopes and ambitions of the Stieglitz group in 
the spring of 1913. It promised, moreover, to both “291” members and their audience, 
that the gallery would continue to act on the cutting edge of the American and 


international avant-gardes.

The “Debate” in Camera Work 


On February 18, 1913, in a letter to his old friend, the critic Sadakichi 
Hartmann, written while the Armory Show was still in progress, Alfred Stieglitz 
described the spring exhibitions at “291.” Upcoming shows of work by Francis Picabia 
and Marius de Zayas, he wrote, would constitute “the last words in abstraction in 
plastic form.”70 At the time, his enthusiasm seemed unbounded: 


Heaven knows what the future has in store for us. It is all very wonderful and 
yet logical and very sane, although to many people the quintessence of 
insanity.71 


The euphoria that characterised the period immediately following the International 
Exhibition was, however, short-lived. The furore that surrounded the event soon 
subsided and the wide public appreciation of modem art that Oscar Bluemner and 
Hutchins Hapgood had anticipated did not materialise. Moreover, despite the ambitious 
series of exhibitions and publications unleashed on the public by the “291” circle early 
in 1913, the gallery failed to regain the undisputed leadership of the modem art 
movement in New York. Instead, the post-Armory Show period saw the emergence of 
a number of centres of modernist endeavour in the city that competed with “291” for the 
attention of both audiences and markets. By the spring of 1914, attendance at “291” 
seems actually to have declined.72 Stieglitz, writing in the January 1915 issue of 
Camera Work, a volume devoted to appraisals of “291” by some sixty-five interested 
persons, described the situation, and his own state of mind, some twelve months after 


the International Exhibition: 


Another year of experimenting done....Several thousand visitors. Not, by far, 
as many as in previous years. Curiosity seekers have fallen away....I sat in my 
room thinking, weighing, what had been done in the year. Had anything been 


done? Anything added?...What work was to be done in the following year?73 


Stieglitz’s comments bear witness to a sense of anticlimax in the wake of the promise 


held out by the Armory Show that is in strong contrast to the optimism expressed two

years earlier in his letter to Hartmann. Independent accounts from 1914 corroborate 
Stieglitz’s own assessment of the situation. Henry McBride, the art critic for the New 
York Sun, after a visit to “291” in late 1913 or early 1914, found the participants to be 
demoralised, and speculated on the reasons: 


Of course business is not what it was. The great eruption of last year, 
when the armory exhibition showed us fashions in art that none of us had 
dreamed of...cannot be duplicated even in miniature so soon. Nature requires 
time to store up sufficient steam, gas or whatever it is for loud noises. But on 
the other hand it would never do to close up the shop. Mr. Stieglitz therefore 


resumes business at the old stand.74 


The consensus of contemporary opinion seems to have been that the Armory Show had 
explained modern art so thoroughly that, for the time being, nothing more remained to 


be said. 


An examination of the exhibitions organised by “291” during the winter of 
1913-14 provides further evidence of a lack of firm direction at the gallery. Exhibitions 
during that year were neither as ambitious nor as focused as those of the previous 
spring, nor did they cause a similar amount of interest in the press.75 Figurative and 
abstract drawings by the American artist, Abraham Walkowitz, led off the season in 
November, and continued to be on display well into January of the next year. Recent 
painting by Marsden Hartley, an American living in Germany, followed, to be 
succeeded by an exhibition of children’s art, the second such event at “291.” The only 
important European modernist shown was Constantin Brancusi, whose sculpture had 
already been seen in quantity at the Armory in the previous year. Paintings and 
drawings by Paul Haviland’s brother, Frank Burty, an artist who combined modem 
styles into a pleasant pastiche, made up the last show of the season.76 Much of the 
work in these exhibitions was exciting and important, but, to answer the question 
Stieglitz set himself in January 1915, added little that was really new. If the defensive 
tone taken by Paul Haviland in his notes for Camera Work on these exhibitions is any 


indication, “291” insiders were themselves not entirely satisfied with what they had

accomplished. Writing on the Brancusi show, for example, Haviland felt it necessary to 
point out that, while the International Exhibition had displayed plaster casts of the 
sculptor’s work, “291” showed the finished bronzes, and its exhibition thus constituted 
“the first occasion on which America [had] seen the originals.”77 Haviland also 
attributed the failure of Burty’s genial paintings to attract much attention, not to the 
shortcomings of the pictures themselves, but to the deficiencies of the New York 


audience, found to be “ever looking for sensationalism.”78 


Several other factors, in addition to a sense of aesthetic aimlessness, contributed 
to disillusionment at “291.” Francis Picabia, whose art and ideas had been such a 
strong stimulus to experimental activity at the gallery, retumed to France in April of 
1913. No American artist or critic, not even de Zayas, possessed Picabia’s quick 
intelligence or his faith in the validity of the more extreme manifestations of modem art, 
and his departure was a setback to the radical course the group had tentatively embarked 
upon. In 1914, moreover, Stieglitz suffered a series of personal misfortunes that 
substantially reduced his ability to participate in the activities of the gallery. Early in that 
year, his long-time friend and colleague, Joseph Keiley, died after an unexpected 
illness, throwing Stieglitz into a deep emotional depression.’9 Certain other close “291” 
associates, including Sadakichi Hartmann, Benjamin de Casseras, and Eduard 
Steichen, also drifted away for various personal and professional reasons. Then, late in 
1914, Stieglitz fell in love with the artist and poet Katherine Rhoades, only to discover, 
to his great disappointment, that she had no romantic interest in him.80 These 
distractions came at a time when “291,” which had become almost indistinguishable 
from Stieglitz himself, most needed his leadership and creative input, and had the effect 
of leaving a void at the gallery’s centre that could not be completely filled by his 
associates. Not surprisingly, after the summer of 1913, Camera Work was published 


with decreasing frequency and in a less substantial form than in previous years. These

later issues, made up largely of reprinted reviews, cannot have helped to attract new 


readers.81 


The most important cause of disillusionment at “291” in 1913 and 1914, 
however, was an awareness that, despite the declining interest in modem art among the 
general public, it had, in the year following the Armory Show, attracted to itself an 
affluent audience that often looked to sources other than “291” for guidance on artistic 
matters. To Stieglitz’s satisfaction, appreciation for modem art had increased in certain 
bohemian quarters, most notably in Greenwich Village, where it was identified with a 
more general revolt against convention. A number of Greenwich Village radicals, 
including Hippolyte Havel, Mabel Dodge, and the artists Emil Zoler and Adolf Wolff, 
formed close ties with “291” at this time.82 But the new art also attracted the attention 
of a much wealthier, more fashionable, segment of society that had little interest in 
social revolution, but which found in modern art something fresh and exciting.83 Many 
of these people looked on the viewing of art more as a social than an intellectual 
occupation, and were not interested in lectures on its spiritual import from the likes of 
Alfred Stieglitz. An anonymous critic writing for the New York Sun in December of 
1914 described the associations that modern art held for some viewers at the recently 
opened Carroll Galleries: 


Who shall say that the retum of Cubism is bad for business? Ask in 
Delmonico’s [the fashionable restaurant]. They know! There has developed a 
distinct reciprocity between Delmonico’s and the Carroll Galleries. I have seen 
nice white whiskered old gentlemen and lovely ladies in Persian costume 
descend the Delmonico steps after luncheon....some invisible force pulls 
them....into the Carroll Galleries before they are aware..... They stay all 
afternoon. There is something about modem art that makes the eyes of a lovely 


woman shine....Then too it is all so wonderful and so - so - inexpressible.84 


Further evidence of an interest in modern art among affluent sectors of New 
York society is provided by the exposure it received in a number of fashionable 


magazines, including Puck and Vanity Fair. These magazines, which frankly set out to

the leisured classes (although not always for the very rich)- for sophisticated 
urbanites, for the kind of person who was well travelled, well read, well 
acquainted; for people who wanted to be entertained, but on an exalted 
plane....85 


In 1914 a number of “291” insiders, including Marius de Zayas and Benjamin de 
Casseras, themselves formed an association with Puck, a New York weekly that 
published caricatures, political satire and society gossip, as well as a certain amount of 
art and theatrical criticism.86 Although “291” artists and writers contributed to Puck 
mainly with the intention of supplementing their meagre incomes, much of the work 
that appeared there shows the same interest in the modern movement that characterised 
their contributions to Camera Work.87 In 1914 and 1915, for example, Marius de 
Zayas produced a series of caricatures of popular entertainers and society figures for the 
magazine that were drawn in a distinctly “modern” style. Several of these caricatures 
even portrayed important modem artists, including August Rodin and Henri Matisse 
[Fig. 9], while others, such as “The Accidental Cubists” [Fig. 10], assumed a certain 
acquaintance with recent artistic trends on the part of the reader.88 Abraham Walkowitz 
and John Marin, artists whose work had become a “291” staple, also appeared in Puck 
at this time.89 One of Marin’s cubist influenced sketches of New York was even 
featured on the cover of the March 14, 1914 issue accompanied inside by a reprint of 
his catalogue statement for “291” and a note that read: 


Do you admire this front cover? A copy of it in full colours, on very heavy, 
rich paper, for framing purposes, will be mailed, postpaid, anywhere in the 
world on receipt of twenty-five cents in United States stamps or currency. 


About the same time that “291” participants were appearing in Puck, Frank 
Crowninshield, the editor of Vanity Fair, also began publishing articles on modem art 
and artists in that magazine, and adopted “avant-garde” innovations into its layout.?! 


The editors of both Puck and Vanity Fair thus seem to have concluded that there was 


enough understanding of modem art among their largely middle and upper-class

readers to warrant substantial sympathetic treatment of it in their publications. 


A small segment of this new audience for modem art could afford not only to 
read about recent developments in magazines but to own the works of art themselves. 
Stimulated by the Armory Show, a number of wealthy art enthusiasts, among them the 
lawyer John Quinn, Chicago millionaire Arthur Jerome Eddy, inventor Dr. Albert C. 
Bares, and Harvard intellectual Walter Arensberg, set about establishing significant 
private collections of modem art in the United States. These collectors, notably Arthur 
Jerome Eddy, consulted Stieglitz in their efforts to become more acquainted with the 
modem movement, but they soon formed other artistic affiliations as well, or, as in the 
case of Walter Arensberg, became important figures in the art world themselves.92 To 
Stieglitz’s annoyance, these patrons also made extensive purchases from the 
“commercial” galleries that had been set up in 1913 and 1914 to take advantage of 
expanded public interest in the modern movement. These new establishments included 
the Daniel Gallery, owned by the former barman, Charles Daniel, the Washington 
Square Gallery, under the proprietorship of Picasso enthusiasts Robert Coady and 
Michael Brenner, and the Carroll Galleries, operated by Harriet Bryant with the backing 
of John Quinn and artistic advice from Armory Show organisers Walt Kuhn and Walter 
Pach. Encouraged by the success of the Armory Show, more established art dealers, 


notably N. E. Montross, also ventured into the field of modern art.93 


Many of these new art dealers demonstrated a commitment to the modem 
movement second only to that of Stieglitz himself. Like Stieglitz, they exhibited work 
by important European and American artists, often in innovative contexts, and often 
with the intention of bringing new work before the public. Coady and Brenner, for 
example, were the first to exhibit African sculpture as art in the United States, and, in 


1916 and 1917, Coady published The Soil, a groundbreaking magazine that called for 


an art based on the American urban environment.%4 The Carroll Galleries, which soon

became identified with Cubism, showed work by Marcel Duchamp and other French 
artists after they arrived en masse in New York in 1915, and also hosted the first 
exhibition of the American Synchromists. N. E. Montross organised shows by such 
major European artists as Cézanne and Matisse that were much larger than those 
Stieglitz was able to put on, and held group exhibitions of younger American painters 
as well. While a “commercial” stance on the part of the owners of these galleries seems 
not to have precluded a considerable commitment to modem art, most of them did 
manifest a somewhat different attitude toward the sale of their wares than that which 
prevailed at “291.” The notion that modem art stood in opposition to American 
materialism and hypocrisy was not a point of dogma at the Montross or Carroll 
Galleries. The art exhibited there was frankly for sale, and could be had by anyone who 


showed interest in it. 


Not surprisingly, Stieglitz himself soon formed a deep antipathy toward these 
newcomers on the New York art scene. While he did not greatly mind the financial 
losses, which cannot have been very substantial, he seems to have keenly felt the 
challenge that these establishments presented to his monopoly on the presentation of art 
in the city. He believed that the owners of the “commercial” galleries and their advisors, 
who were often the same men who had organised the Armory Show, were profiting 
from his long lonely struggle for modern art in America, and he also feared, with some 
justification, that less experienced and less scrupulous vendors would attempt to pass 
off inferior work on a gullible American public.95 The suspicion with which the 
motives of these men were viewed at “291” is conspicuous in the correspondence 
between Stieglitz and de Zayas on these matters from the summer of 1914. De Zayas 
had travelled to Paris in May of that year with the intention of renewing his contacts 
with the French avant-garde, and in order to collect works of art for display at “291.” 
To his disappointment, he discovered that the recently opened Washington Square 


Gallery had obtained exclusive New York rights to Picasso’s current production from

his agent, D. H. Kahnweiler. Without the presence of Picasso, one of the best known 
of the modem artists, “291” was in real danger of presenting another lacklustre series 

of exhibitions during the upcoming season. Although de Zayas can have known little 

about about Coady and Brenner, he wrote to Stieglitz on May 27 that “he [Brenner] is 
going to be a danger to modem art in America,” and that “Kahnweiler is also taking a 

decided attitude of commercialism.”% Stieglitz, in his reply of June 9, wrote that 


if only he knew how slick and irresponsible, how absolutely without 
conscience the average American is, Kahnweiler might spare himself some great 
disappointment....Washington Square is to be purely commercial, and as long 
as Kahnweiler has become purely so, the less we have to do with him the 
better.97 


The underlying assumption here is that only “291” had the spiritual wherewithal to 


resist American deception and guile, and that it alone was therefore qualified to guide 


Europeans across its seas of corruption.% 


Stieglitz himself dearly would have liked to sell more of the work produced by 
his often indigent stable of artists, and had he changed his business methods he 
probably would have been quite successful. Stieglitz’s reputation for honesty and 
quality, and the spiritual aura his method of presentation lent to the work on display, 
had the effect of giving it considerable marketability. But although Stieglitz was often 
able to command high prices, he continued to sell only to those people who he believed 
had a true understanding of the art exhibited. “291,” therefore, continued, as before, to 
be more of an educational institution and an artist’s salon than an art gallery proper. 
Stieglitz’s intellectual investment in the old methods was too great for him to consider a 
substantial revision of his business practices. With his ideals under threat it must, 


moreover, have seemed all the more important not to change. 


Stieglitz’s response to the difficulties faced by “291” in the period following the 


Armory Show was, typically, to examine the crisis from a theoretical perspective. In

late 1913 and in 1914, Camera Work published a series of articles that addressed, at an 
abstract level, some of the problems that modem art had recently encountered in New 
York, and that attempted to provide some solutions. This “debate” in Camera Work 
was conducted within the framework of ideas that had been set out by “291” in the 
exhibitions and publications of early 1913, and dealt critically with such issues as the 
place of modem art in the contemporary world, the claim of abstraction to be able to 
effect meaningful communication, and the phenomenon of art’s sudden fashionability. 
Surprisingly, given the enthusiasm for abstract art displayed in the 1913 Special Issue 
and other publications, the arguments made in the “debate” were often aesthetically 
rather conservative, and drew into question some of the bases by which radical 
innovation had only recently been justified at “291.” Where the Special Issue had 
championed abstract art on the grounds that it was the necessary expression of an 
expanded consciousness, subsequent essays in Camera Work condemned the new art 
for having embraced a “plastic solipsism” that had appeal only for “aesthetic super- 
snobs.”99 Although the magazine continued to present a variety of points of view, the 
size and substance of these conservative essays tended to overpower the more avant- 
garde materials published. Taken as a group, issues of Camera Work that appeared 
after the summer of 1913 constitute an intellectual regression on the part of Stieglitz and 
his associates that requires some explanation. It is my contention that the “debate” in 
Camera Work must, at one level, be read as a reflection of “291”’s uncertain situation 
in the New York art world, and as an attempt to solve the gallery’s practical problems 


by creating for it a new identity that would reposition “291” within the changed 


circumstances of the post-Armory Show period. 100 


Although the publication of these conservative essays by Camera Work can best 
be understood with reference to changes that were taking place in the New York art 
world, opinions expressed in them were undoubtedly reflective of the sincerely held 


beliefs of some “291” associates. The radical abstraction that had been such a

conspicuous feature of exhibitions during the spring of 1913 had been difficult for 
many “291” participants to accept, and it is hardly surprising that contrary opinions 
eventually found an outlet. Artists such as Eduard Steichen, John Marin, and Oscar 
Bluemner, while they agreed that the artist must interpret the world according to his or 
her own individual sensibility, retained a deep allegiance to recognisable subject matter 
and to the need for ready communication with the audience. The passing of the 
exhilarating intellectual climate that immediately followed the Armory Show seems to 
have removed the stimulant that made experiment appear to be the most important 
aspect of modern artistic endeavour, and allowed those with misgivings concerning the 
value of abstraction to gain a platform for their views.!0! Interestingly, these 
misgivings seem actually to have been increased by the presence at “291” of the large 
painting by Kandinsky that Stieglitz had bought out of the Armory Show [Fig. 11: 
“Garden of Love (Improvisation #27)”]. From the prominent part the example of 
Kandinsky played in the “debate” in Camera Work, it is clear that this painting, one of 
the artist’s more advanced, was the focus of much discussion at the gallery, and that for 
some the Russian artist had come to represent the worst case of modem art’s alienation 
from material and social being.!02 For most American artists, the purpose of 
abstraction in art was to enhance the power of personal expression and thus facilitate 


communication, aims that Kandinsky seemed to have abrogated.103 


The controversy at “291” over the meaning and value of abstraction seems to 
have been further intensified by the response that the spring 1913 exhibitions had 
elicited from the public. Reviews of shows by both Picabia and de Zayas, which 
probably reflect wider public opinion, were almost uniformly negative, and must have 
been a sobering rebuke to those “291” participants who had hoped that their art would 
be more widely understood. While Stieglitz and his associates tended to dismiss 
philistine commentary on the work they exhibited, unfavourable opinions of these 


exhibitions were expressed even by critics who had, in the past, been quite sympathetic

toward modem art and “291.” Most painfully, several of these reviewers, including 
Samuel Swift of the Sun and Charles Caffin of the New York American, faulted the 
work of Picabia and de Zayas on the very grounds that the artists themselves 
maintained it was most successful. Despite Picabia’s claim to be able to communicate 
his ideas by means of form, Samuel Swift found that he himself could not, in fact, 


comprehend the “laws” of the “new convention” that the artist was trying to 
establish.104 “Tt is a large order, this building up by a few artists of a new language all 


by themselves,” he wrote. 


As the ordinary visitor looks about him he will not be likely, even with the aid 
of the catalogue and of Mr. Picabia’s clearly printed titles upon the top of his 
pictures, to perceive the relationship of the graphic result to the emotional 
cause....Even Stieglitz, who has been a sort of high priest of the new 
movements, will tell you that he ‘gets’ this one but not that. You think again of 
the laborious task of constructing over again an entire language, say in terms of 


Chinese ideographs. 105 


Worse still, Charles Caffin, a close friend of Stieglitz and a frequent contributor to 
Camera Work, claimed to see in de Zayas’ abstract caricatures nothing but “caricatures 
of the ‘New Evolution in Plastic Expression.’”!06 In what appears to have been a 
deliberate application of de Zayas’ critique of communication by means of form to the 
artist’s work, Caffin gave his interpretation of de Zayas’ intentions: 


The fundamental impossibility, as he [de Zayas] sees it, is that concrete thought 
cannot be expressed exclusively through abstract symbols. What happens if you 
logically carry out the exclusive use of abstract symbols is shown in these 
caricatures. They are a reductio ad absurdum of the principles of the 


Extremists. 107 
Accusations such as these struck at the heart of the rationale that de Zayas had only 
recently formulated for his art and that had allowed him, for a time, to produce work 
comparable with that of Picabia and Kandinsky. It was, perhaps, in reaction to these 


criticisms that, following the spring of 1913, de Zayas interrupted the production of 
abstract caricatures for over a year.!08 More generally, these adverse opinions seem to 


have called for a public reexamination in Camera Work of the bases of abstraction and

The November 1913 Camera Work, which reprinted these reviews, was also 


the first issue of the magazine published after the Armory Show to express strong 
reservations with regard to abstraction in art.109 The contents of the volume were 
diverse, and included catalogue statements from the spring of 1913, as well as 
reproductions of photographs by Eduard Steichen. An article by de Zayas that 
accompanied Steichen’s work restated aspects of de Zayas’ theory of modem art with 
reference to photography.!!0 Dominating the issue, however, was a long essay by 
John Weichsel, entitled “Cosmism and Amorphism,” that constituted a severe 
indictment of the modern movement.!!! Weichsel was a socialist who had only recently 
become acquainted with Stieglitz, and who, through him, had become aware of the 
changes that were taking place in art.!12 The title of Weichsel’s essay was a reference 


to “Vers Amorphism,” an article published in the summer Special Issue of Camera 


Work that purported to be the manifesto of the “Amorphist” school of painting.113 
Upon careful reading, it becomes clear that “Amorphist” canvases are, in fact, entirely 
blank, and that their supposed contents are all in the eye of the credulous beholder. 
Although “Vers Amorphism,” which originally appeared in a Paris weekly, seems to 
have been published in the Special Issue as an amusing example of philistinism, 
Weichsel obviously read the piece with some interest. In “Cosmism and “Amorphism,” 
he argues that the manifesto is, in fact, a quite accurate description of the present state 
of affairs. Abstract painters, among whom Weichsel counts the French Cubists, have 
indeed emptied painting of all meaningful content, and, in the process, have betrayed 
modem art’s great promise: 


...the New Artist’s world is focused from a distance whence the corporeality of 
things becomes diffused in their atmosphere. Then all things abide only as 
form, - shape as an idea; reality as a mood. Ever higher altitudes of the New 
movement have been signalised by their ever increasing elimination of 
concreteness. Picasso, Picabia, Kandinsky have built their straight road tangent 
to our globe. They are marching undauntedly toward its other end....Soon they

will have stripped themselves to bareness; yet the march toward infinity is 
hardly begun....Aiming at Cosmism [the new art] has led to Amorphism; to a 
tabula rasa.!14 


Elsewhere, Weichsel’s language is even stronger. Modem art, he writes, is “a sterile 


bud,” “a deformed growth and abortive outcome,” and “a logical miscarriage.”115 


According to Weichsel, the dire predicament into which art had fallen was the 
result of the attempts by certain modern artists to sum up the universal by means of 
individual consciousness, and to express the insights gained by means of private 
symbols.116 Although Weichsel believed that the artist’s rebellion against convention 
was justified, he maintained that the very latest insurrections were characterised by such 
extremism that they had sundered spirit from matter and individual from society. 
Weichsel’s purpose in “Cosmism and Amorphism” was to help bring about a 
reconciliation, the beginnings of which, he believed, must come from artists 
themselves. In his opinion, artists should, by means of their work, attempt to contact 
and express a common “‘raciality,” a concept not well defined but apparently similar to a 
collective unconscious.!!7 The results of their labour would, he hoped, help to enrich 
both art and life, and give back to the artist a social purpose once again. Although its 
scope is broad, “Cosmism and Amorphism” seems specifically intended as a reply to 
those writers in the summer Special Issue of Camera Work who had made the most 
enthusiastic claims for abstraction. Thus, Weichsel specifically signalled out as 
examples of the thinking that had led to the emaciation of art both Gabrielle Buffet’s 
“new state of mind to which the external world appears more clearly in the abstract,” 
and Maurice Aisen’s analogous “sixth sense.”!!8 Although Weichsel did not mention 


Marius de Zayas by name, his theories appear to be the focus of a severe condemnation 
of the application of science outside its proper sphere. “There are,” he writes, “roughly 


three large domains of expression.” 


The one having a source and self-end most ancient - art. The second, operating 
with most up-to-date sources and ends - science. The third, which comes from

an interaction of the two previous ones is - artistry....119 


...in art, the attempt to express its building material - man, intellect, 
imagination, experience, mass, form, color, etc., - in purely abstract...terms, 
has caused the transmutation of art-activity into art-scholasticism, i.e. an 
artisanship consisting of the interaction of two distinctly opposed spheres of 
activity. 120 


Coming on the heels of the Special Issue, the prominence given to “Cosmism 
and Amorphism” in the November 1913 Camera Work comes as something of a 
surprise. Publication of this lengthy article can, of course, be partly explained as the 
result of a growing influence of conservative opinion at “291” in the latter half of 1913. 
Faced with a rising chorus of opposition to the extreme in art, Stieglitz appears to have 
given Weichsel the role of devil’s advocate and allowed him to criticise the art and ideas 
of some of the closer associates.121 There is some evidence, however, that “Cosmism 
and Amorphism” did, in fact, have considerable importance for Stieglitz himself, and 
that he cooperated with Weichsel in its preparation. On August 24, 1913, Weichsel 
wrote to Stieglitz thanking him for help with the paper and asking for further advice.122 
Stieglitz, in a letter dated August 26, replied that Weichsel’s essay was “a splendid 
piece of work - a valuable - a most opportune one.” He continued: 


I expect printing it in the next no. and if I can manage shall strike off extra 
copies on cheaper paper, for this document must be more widely circulated than 


Camera Work can possibly be.!23 
Although Stieglitz’s enthusiasm for “Cosmism and Amorphism” was probably 
genuine, one suspects that Weichsel’s opinions were, in fact, only one of a range of 
views that Stieglitz wished to see articulated, and that “291” ideology had not, in fact, 


gone over completely to the conservative side. 
In the course of 1913, and even before, Stieglitz and his associates had made an 


enormous intellectual investment in abstraction that could not so easily be abrogated. 


The exhibitions of spring 1913 and essays in the Special Issue had identified

abstraction as being on the cutting edge of modern thought generally, and had, in this 
way, suggested that “291”’s work in the artistic avant-garde had a far-reaching 
importance. Convincing arguments had been made that abstraction in art was the means 
by which the individual could best synthesise modern experience and express an inner 
vision without hindrance from external sources. Perhaps most important of all, at 
“291,” abstract art had come to stand for a purity of mind and spirit, and for an 
unwillingness to compromise in the face of social and commercial pressures, that 
accorded well with Stieglitz’s personal philosophy.!24 Given the enormous investment 


that had been made in abstraction, it is also not surprising that, shortly after Stieglitz 
had endorsed Weichsel’s essay, he made arrangements to exhibit Marsden Hartley’s 
recent abstract work, all of which had been produced in Germany under the direct 
influence of Kandinsky. Interested observers from outside “291”’s ranks also 
continued to identify the gallery as the prime staging ground for abstraction in America. 
The critic Henry McBride, in the review already quoted, remarked, in March of 1914, 
perhaps with some hyperbole, that 


in the gallery of the Photo-Secession, where Mr. Stieglitz and his disciples hold 
forth for months together, there is never so much as a lead pencil sketch in the 
little exhibitions which may properly be said to have a subject, and the word of 
all other words that may be constantly overheard in the discussions there is 
‘pure.’ Mr. Walkowitz’s little drawings last year were pure. This year they are 


still purer.!25 


The continued exhibition by “291” of abstract work suggests that the 
appearance in Camera Work of essays such as Weichsel’s “Cosmism and Amorphism” 
should not be taken as evidence of a complete disillusionment with the extreme in art at 
the gallery. I would suggest, rather, that the publication of such aesthetically 
conservative opinions was part of an effort by Stieglitz and his associates to distance 
“291” from the smart but superficial audience for modem art that was just then making 


its presence known, and that would soon come to frequent “291”’s “commercial” 


rivals.126 The conservative tendency discernible in Camera Work had the effect of

informing the New York public that “291” did not merely serve up art for its 
entertainment value, but was a place where concems raised by the modern movement in 
intelligent observers were seriously addressed.!27 This change in intellectual position 
had the effect of carving for the gallery a niche in the New York art world that was then 
somewhat unique, the occupation of which set “291” somewhat apart from the 
mainstream, and which, incidentally, promised to bring in a substantial number of new 
visitors. Publication of Weichsel’s essay, in so far as it indicated that “291” was willing 
to come down from the heights and meet the common people, was also a reaffirmation 
of the gallery’s social mission, as always, an important part of Stieglitz’s artistic 
philosophy. By keeping the point of contact with the audience at an intellectual level, 
moreover, “291” could hope to have an impact on the public without stooping to the 
methods of the for-profit galleries. That the advocacy of more conservative positions 


also constituted an artistic regression appears not to have mattered for the time being. 


The hypothesis that the “debate” in Camera Work was, in fact, related to 
changes in the audience for modem art gains support from the publication in the March 
1914 issue of another essay by John Weichsel, entitled “The Rampant Zeitgeist,” and 
an article on Abraham Walkowitz by Oscar Bluemner. Both these essays were similar 
in theme to “Cosmism and Amorphism” and had the effect of confirming “291” in the 
self-critical and somewhat retrograde direction that had been initiated by the magazine 
the previous fall. It is probably no coincidence that, by the spring of 1914, several 
“commercial” galleries specialising in modem art were operating in New York, thus 
making clear the true nature of the changes that had been brought about by the Armory 
Show.128 Modem art, it must have seemed to Stieglitz, had, in spite of expectations, 
proved just as susceptible to commercial exploitation as more traditional work, and 
could not, in itself, be trusted to attract the right kind of attention. In these changed 
circumstances, the battles that “291” was called upon to fight concerned the places in 


which the new art was shown, and the kinds of reception that art patrons received

there. In the spring of 1914, therefore, it was more important than ever that “291” 
create for itself an image that would identify it as a centre for serious aesthetic debate 


and not as a place of amusement. 


Weichsel’s “The Rampant Zeitgeist,” a considerably more polished piece of 
writing than his previous effort, was a vehement condemnation of all faddishness in 
art. Although the adherents of the “Zeitgeist” who draw Weichsel’s wrath include 
artists who pander to conventional taste for monetary gain, the main objects of his 
scom are those avant-gardists and their followers who, believing in the inevitability of 
progress, attempt to place themselves at its head by the advocacy of idiosyncratic work 
and esoteric theories. Weichsel finds that members of this latter group identify 
themselves clearly by the confused nature of their thinking: 


They have read Tarde and Le Bon and Marc Baldwin, with their whole mind, 
yet in their hearts they have Nietsche [sic], who keeps himself quite up to date 
and speaks a fluent Bergsonian tongue. Hence, their erudite garrulity and 
polyglotal obscurity. Their talk is intricate. They say that, truly, the artist is of 
God’s grace, yet man’s tents are the temples of deity. Indeed, creative force is 
focused in a superman’s artistic soul. And yet, the artist is only a link in 


creation’s undivided chain, a consciously recording organ.!29 
Weichsel believed that such nebulous theorising was not only reprehensible in itself, 
but that it also served to remove artists farther from the community of which they 
rightly were a part. “There is still wanting a bridge between two human neighbours,” 
he asserted, “although there are scaffoldings enough to reach the Almighty.” 


Hence comes the anomaly of an artist who sidles with an all- propitiating air 
through mob-filled streets, while his thought swaggers through the exalted 


spaces overhead. 130 
As in “Cosmism and Amorphism,” Weichsel argued that art “must not try to assume the 
scale of our day, to be beneficent for our time,” but must aim to be the expression of a 
deeper human “raciality.”13! Although “The Rampant Zeitgeist” undoubtedly expressed 
Weichsel’s own beliefs, its publication by Camera Work was also an indication to the 


public for art that “291” would blindly accept extreme aesthetic theorising no more 


44 


piehatit ? 


iets 2acslcTS To!) cyl . 2 


readily than it would assent to artistic experimentation without public enquiry. The 
essay thus distanced Stieglitz and “291” further from fads current at other venues and 
laid claim to more intellectual territory that the gallery could call its own. Readers were 
informed that, although “291” had become associated with the extreme in art, it was 


there that “bridges” between “human neighbours” were nevertheless being built. 


Weichsel’s essay was complemented in the March 1914 issue of Camera Work 
by an appreciation of the American artist Abraham Walkowitz by his friend Oscar 
Bluemner. Although the essay was entitled “Walkowitz,” it was, essentially, yet 
another inquiry into the problem of modem art’s attenuated means of expression. The 
opinions expressed were aesthetically rather conservative and are evidence of a change 
in Bluemner’s thinking in the months since the appearance of his enthusiastic article on 
the Armory Show. Bluemner’s purpose was to compare Walkowitz, whose realistic 
and abstract drawings were reproduced in the same volume, with Kandinsky, who, 
according to Bluemner, had become an extremist and cut himself off from “life”: 


Walkowitz is impelled by the ‘inner necessity’: Kandinsky, however, like the 
other radicals, appears not to proceed gradually and inwardly, but with a mind 


made up to commit an intellectual feat - which is not art.132 


In words that are reminiscent of Weichsel in “Cosmism and Amorphism,” Bluemner 
maintained that true art is actually the antithesis of individualism: 


Is self-expression the highest object of art? Not unless individual talent 
is the instrument of the cultural spirit, mouthpiece of the human heart en masse. 
There is a lot of bosh, today, about guaranteeing the liberties and unmuzzled 


barkings of every dog and pup.!33 
Walkowitz, he found, had achieved the reconciliation of art and life that was coming to 


be of such importance at “291”: 


He [Walkowitz] is Tolstoian in his affection for humanity, for the laboring, 
sorrowing, struggling millions which throng the east side, or frolic in the parks and on 
the seashore. Amidst such he absorbs and afterward records his impressions. Not in 
naturalistic-academic pictures, for he is the living antithesis of the Academic. Rather he 


proceeds in a constructive way to recreate. 134

On one level, Bluemner’s “Walkowitz” was a quite transparent effort to 
promote an artist whose work had only recently been shown at “291.” The long 
duration of this exhibition, on view for well over a month, and the attention given to the 
artist in the March 1914 Camera Work suggest, however, that Walkowitz, more than 
any artist associated with “291,” was the focus of artistic and professional hopes at the 
gallery during the winter of 1913-14.135 Although Weichsel seems not entirely to have 
approved of him, Walkowitz’s work did, in fact, meet some of the criteria for a “racial” 
art set out in “Cosmism and Amorphism.”!36 Walkowitz worked in a simplified, 
almost monumental, style that had the effect of universalising his themes, which 
included labourers and the dancer, Isadora Duncan, as well as such sympathetic 
subjects as lovers and mothers with children [Fig. 12]. The enthusiasm Walkowitz 
aroused at “291” may also have been due to the fact that, while much of his art was 
realistic and readily understandable, he also worked in a more abstract style, and could 
thus be seen to reconcile two artistic polarities. The forms Walkowitz used in his 
abstract work were, moreover, often based on parts of the human body, and bore titles 
such as “From Life to Life I,” as if to underline the connection with the humanitarian 
subjects of his more realistic work [Fig. 13]. Paul Haviland, in his description of 
Walkowitz’s abstracts for Camera Work, wrote that 


in those drawings where lines, suggested by the curve of a breast, the stooping 
of a back, the sinuosity of a hip, commingle in uninterrupted patterns, we feel 
as if he had translated into a graphic pattern the tactile sensations of a sensitive 
hand playing over the human body without sequence but with keen response. 
Comparing the later work of Walkowitz with that shown at his first exhibition 


we feel that he has become less austere while remaining just as human.137 
Unfortunately, if reviews reprinted in Camera Work are any indication, Walkowitz’s 
recent abstract work was no better understood by the general public than the art of 
Picabia and de Zayas.138 Nevertheless, the terms by which it was presented in the 
March 1914 issue suggest that certain members of the “291” circle, including Stieglitz 


himself, believed that it might find an appreciative audience.

Marius de Zayas’ contribution to the March 1914 issue of Camera Work, and to 
the “debate” that was taking place in the magazine, was his last major piece of 
theoretical writing, entitled “Moder Art - Theories and Representations.” The essay 
isolated one aspect of de Zayas’ thinking on modem art, the perceived gulf between 
form and the ideas it claimed to communicate, for closer examination. In de Zayas’ 
opinion, while the “theories” of art and their plastic “representations” could be mutually 
stimulating, the one could not be a reflection of the other: 


...the ‘new’ art is not the expression of its theories. It follows, at the same time, 
two criterions: one inner, conscious, subjective and absolute; and the other, 
outer, experimental and relative. We could say that the one is a ‘mental’ analysis 
while the other is a ‘plastic’ analysis. With its theories it wants to get at the 
subjective truth; and with its practice at the objective truth. It wants to get at 

the synthesis of all thought and at the essence of all facts.139 


While the problem was an old one for de Zayas, the renewed interest he exhibited here 
in the incommunicability of ideas by form suggests that “Modern Art - Theories and 


Representations” was written with similar objections to abstraction made by Charles 
Caffin and others at least partly in mind.!40 Given the critical context of the essay’s 
production, it is not surprising that de Zayas, even more than in the past, was willing to 
take public incomprehension of the new art into account, and was even able to appeal to 
this lack of understanding in order to make his point. “A theory, formulated by logical 
reasoning,” he wrote, 


might not be convincing, but is always comprehensible. Were it possible for 
plastic productions of modem art to be the logical reasoning of its theories they 
would be, if not convincing, at least understood by the generality of the art 
public. But they cannot be. The theories are, in relation to the plastic works, 
their philosophical justification; but the plastic works remain as isolated 
facts....An idea can only be represented by form if we give to form a 


conventional value.!41 
Although these ideas were first elaborated by de Zayas in 1912, it is significant that 
they should bear restatement two years later, illustrated by such examples. In light of 
the claims he had only recently made for the ability of his abstract caricatures to 


delineate personality, “Modem Art - Theories and Representations” reads very much

like a retraction of his former views, and should probably be considered as his personal 
response to the “crisis” of 1914. Taken together with articles by Weichsel and 
Bluemner in the same volume, de Zayas’ essay also reads like a variation on a common 
theme. All three of these authors were profoundly aware of the immense disparity 
between modern art’s vast ambitions and what had actually been accomplished, and of 
the growing estrangement between artists and audiences. De Zayas and Weichsel, 
moreover, were united in their contempt for efforts made by some modem artists to 
express metaphysical concepts in art, Weichsel because he believed that such 
aspirations evacuated art of the elements that gave it social meaning, de Zayas because 
he saw in such work a misunderstanding of what art could and could not do. De Zayas 
and Weichsel both wanted to see modem art aim at more practical, less speculative, 
ends. But while Weichsel was altogether unable to approve of abstraction in art, de 
Zayas could at least applaud its investigative potential, and suggest that, if audiences 


would learn to understand the “scientific” purpose of modern endeavour, they might 


find in modem art something worth looking at.!42 


De Zayas’ article on “Theories and Representations,” therefore, despite its 
distaste for much modern work, was optimistic that art did have an avant-garde future. 
In an interesting twist to his argument, de Zayas could even cite the proliferation of 
“theory” as evidence that modern art was advancing intellectually.!43 Like Weichsel, 
however, de Zayas was critical of mere fashionable speculation, which, he believed, 
could lead only to intellectual aberrations: 


The idea of evolution....has become the primum mobile of a great majority of 
the followers of the modern movement of art. It has become a moral disease 
which has spread in the form of an epidemic of intellectualism....This epidemic 
of intellectualisation is responsible for those numerous cases that we so often 
meet with of ultra-individualism, generally accompanied by unlimited 

egoaltry whose expressions are the extravagant exaggerations of the discoveries 


made by the investigators.144 


Remarks such as these were a means by which de Zayas could distinguish his own

theorising from the kind of confused thinking that Weichsel had also repudiated in “The 
Rampant Zeitgeist.” De Zayas was thus able to stake out a new intellectual position for 


himself, remote from the extremism that was just then becoming suspect at “291.” 


De Zayas’ “Modem Art - Theories and Representations,” then, together with 
essays by Weichsel and Bluemner, had the effect of taking “291” in a more sober and 
conservative intellectual direction. If, as seems likely, this change in the gallery’s 
Orientation was embarked upon with the effect on the public uppermost in mind, it 
seems not to have had the desired result. Modemist activity in New York continued to 
be diffused over a number of centres, and attendance at “291” continued to decline. One 
suspects, moreover, that the conservative course taken by Camera Work soon became a 
problem in itself. As “291” allied itself with more retrograde aesthetic positions it 
removed itself from the leading edge of the very movement with which the gallery had 
become so closely identified, without putting anything very substantial in its place. 
Rather than helping to bring about a solution to the problem of public disaffection, the 
“debate” conceming abstraction had the effect of making “291” appear even more 
inward looking and indecisive. There is, in fact, an air of unreality to the “debate” in 
Camera Work that probably bears some relation to the sense of aimlessness experienced 
by certain “291” associates in this period. While the arguments put forward were often 
intellectually astute, the “debate” as a whole was lacking in detail, and the precise 
targets of the invective released are often hard to determine. The solutions arrived at by 
the participants, moreover, have the disturbing quality of being imaginary solutions to 
what are, in fact, very practical problems. Articles such as Weichsel’s “Cosmism and 
Amorphism,” or Bluemner’s “Walkowitz,” suggested that the problems faced by “291” 
in 1913 and 1914 were closely linked to the prevalence of abstraction at the gallery, and 
that correction of the artistic fault would bring about a resolution of the entire 
predicament. Their exclusive focus on the problem of abstraction had the effect of 


suggesting that “291”’s isolation from the world at large and the “amorphousness” of

the canvases on display were, in a very real sense, one and the same thing. If only 
artists would renounce their plastic extremism, they implied, then the split between 
“291” and its public would also be healed. Unfortunately, the problem was more 
complicated than these writers seem to have realised, and involved changes in the New 


York art world and the growing commodification of art itself. 


From the summer of 1914, Stieglitz and de Zayas seem to have realised that 
there were some serious shortcomings to the intellectual direction that “291” was 
pursuing. After the March 1914 issue, the “debate” on abstraction occupied a less 
prominent place in the pages of Camera Work, and more avant-garde work began to 
take its place. John Weichsel, the most prominent of the conservatives, was allowed to 
contribute only one more essay to the magazine. Published in the fall 1914 issue, this 
article, entitled “Artists and Others,” added little that was really new to his argument.!45 
Significantly, the previous issue of Camera Work had published the “Aphorisms on 
Futurism” by the English poet Mina Loy, that, in their advocacy of all aspects of the 
moder, were very similar to essays that had appeared in the summer 1913 Special 
Issue.!46 By means of a series of propositions, Loy argued that the individual ego was 
indeed sufficient to encompass the entire universe, and that the future of art lay with 
such efforts. As if in reply to John Weichsel, she found that extreme artistic forms 
were, in fact, requisite to the relevance of art for the modern world, and dismissed the 
notion of a collective unconscious: 


MAN is only a slave of his own mental lethargy. 
YOU cannot restrict the mind’s capacity. 


THEREFORE you stand not only in abject servitude to your perceptive 
consciousness -- 


BUT also to the mechanical re-actions of the subconsciousness, that rubbish 
heap of race-tradition -- 


AND believing yourself free -- your least conception is coloured by the pigment 
of retrograde superstitions.

The subsequent issue of Camera Work, which appeared in October, 1914, immediately 
following Marius de Zayas’ return from an extended visit to Paris, represents, save for 


Weichsel's last essay, a continued renewal of faith in forward-looking modernism. 


The “What ‘291’ Means to Me” Issue 


Alfred Stieglitz’s personal response to the unfortunate predicament in which 
“291” found itself in 1914, and the final soul-searching of the post-Armory Show 
period, was the preparation of yet another Special Issue of Camera Work. Published in 
January of 1915, it contained the unedited responses of sixty-eight interested persons to 
the question “What does ‘291’ mean to me?” The project was initiated by Stieglitz in 
May, 1914 and seems to have occupied more of his time and energy than any other 
“291” activity of that year.!48 Stieglitz provided his own account of the project’s 
origins in the preface to the volume, one of the few occasions on which he committed 
his thoughts to print. He described how he had sat in his room during the spring 
“thinking, weighing, what had been done in the year. Had anything been done? 
Anything added?”!49 He soon realised that 


during the past year, a certain question had been put to me, more and more 
frequently. The question: ‘What does ‘291’ Mean?’150 


Because he found that he could not provide a definite answer to the question, he 
decided to turn to the interlocutors for their opinion, asking them to leave out, if 


possible, any reference to himself: 


Why not let the people tell me what it is to them. And in telling me, perhaps 
they will tell each other. Some say ‘tis I. 1 know it is not I. What is it?151 


Although Stieglitz’s motives in initiating the project were probably diverse, there is no 


reason to doubt that he sincerely believed the answers submitted would give him a

better idea of the impact “291” was having on people whose opinion he valued most, 
and that the information obtained might help him to chart the gallery’s future course. 
The project reveals “291” in its ostensibly most receptive mode, and, as such, is yet 
another example of the application, on Stieglitz’s part, to the public arena for a sense of 
creative bearings. It can be seen as a continuation, by somewhat different means, of the 
inquiry into the problem of art’s relevance that had already been undertaken by ene 
Work. 


In many respects, the “What ‘291’ means to me” issue of Camera Work was 
quite successful. More people than anticipated asked to be involved in the project and 
almost all the contributions received praised Stieglitz’s efforts on behalf of moder art 
in America. Even Arthur Hoeber, a critic unremittingly hostile to all modern tendencies 
in art, used the occasion to commend Stieglitz’s personal courage and integrity.!52 The 
volume, which appeared at a time when the gallery’s position in the New York art 
world was under threat, also provided it with some badly needed advertising. When the 
issue is judged on the basis of the criteria that Stieglitz set out in his preface, however, 
the volume can be seen to have some serious shortcomings. In spite of Stieglitz’s 
request for spontaneous opinions, the answers received said little about “291” that was 
very new, and were couched in such similar terms that the volume took on an almost 
mind-numbing uniformity. In spite of his explicit request, moreover, almost all the 
respondents wrote at length about Stieglitz’s own unique qualities, even going so far as 
to make no meaningful distinction between Stieglitz and the gallery.!53 Worse still, the 
“What ‘291’ means to me” issue offered few insights into the place “291” occupied in 
American life or in the New York and international art worlds. Few of the contributors 
demonstrated an awareness that, as the volume was in preparation, “291” was going 
through something of a crisis of confidence, and therefore had few suggestions as to 
how the gallery might escape the sense of irrelevance that, for insiders, had become 


such a serious problem. One suspects that this blindness to “291”’s misfortunes was

not entirely unpremeditated, and that many contributors deliberately chose to use this 
Opportunity not to dwell on “291”’s shortcomings but to acknowledge Stieglitz’s 
undeniably significant contributions to art in America. Most of the people involved 
must also have realised that it would be imprudent to offend such a powerful member 
of the artistic community, and thus kept any unfavourable opinions to themselves. The 
only significant exception to the general chorus of approval was the reply submitted by 
Stieglitz’s old colleague, Eduard Steichen, which will be considered below in some 


detail. 


The list of contributors to the volume, conveniently provided at the front, is of 
some interest in itself, and provides some evidence of the kinds of people who visited 
“291” and read Camera Work.!54 All the “291” insiders, including Marius de Zayas, 
Paul Haviland, and Agnes Meyer, were, of course, represented, as were those artists, 
such as John Marin and Abraham Walkowitz, who were closely associated with the 
gallery. Man Ray, Adolf Wolff, Emil Zoler, and other artists active in New York, also 
participated. Such photographers as Anne Brigman, Francis Bruguiere, and H. 
Mortimer Lamb, who admired Stieglitz’s spirit and who had not been completely 
disaffected by his recent enthusiasms, formed another sizable group. Contributions also 
came from a number of important writers and critics, including Alfred Kreymborg and 
Djuna Barnes, and from Greenwich Villagers such as Mabel Dodge and Hippolyte 
Havel. Interestingly, many of the contributors were women and a surprising number 
lived outside New York City. Taken as a whole, the list suggests that “291” activities 
were followed with interest by quite a large number of persons active in literary and 
artistic fields in New York and by a substantial number of intelligent lay enthusiasts as 
well. The variety of persons who chose to participate in Stieglitz’s project and the 
complimentary nature of the replies received raises the question of why he and other 
“291” associates were, in fact, so intent on questioning the gallery’s continued 


usefulness. Significantly perhaps, while several gallery owners, including N. E.

Montross and Charles Daniel were included, the collectors who had recently turned 
their attention to modem art did not participate, and, with the exception of Arthur 


Davies, neither did the organisers of the Armory Show who had become their advisors. 


The contributions contained in the “What ‘291’ means to me” issue of Camera_ 
Work form a valuable compendium of the metaphors and images that were used to 
describe the gallery. The very uniformity of the responses submitted leads one to 
suspect that a rather limited number of conceptions of “291” and its activities were 
current, and that these most likely had a common origin in the Stieglitz circle itself. The 
reply submitted by Hutchins Hapgood is typical in its use of imagery and in the 
importance it placed on the person of Alfred Stieglitz. “‘291’ to me,” Hapgood wrote, 


is a ‘Salon,’ a laboratory, and a refuge - a place where people may 

exchange ideas and feelings, where artists can present and try out their 
experiments and where those who are tired of what is called ‘practical’ life may 
find a change of spiritual atmosphere. 

I go there when my irritation is intense - as to a cooling oasis. I go there 
to meet a rare human group in which is nourished a strenuous love for human 
expression. I go there to see Alfred Stieglitz, to live for an hour in his 
spirit, to realize his pure courage and to feel his genuine attempt to get at what is 
called truth, which is something that may be felt but which is never defined. 
Because he loves the truth he is hospitable to all who feel they have some 
vision, no matter how slight, and even to those who desire the vision but know 


they have it not.155 
Hapgood’s reply is most representative in its claim that the values prevailing at “291” 
were different from and opposed to those current in society as a whole, and that the 
gallery provided a refuge for individuals tired of American corruption and materialism. 
“Oasis,” “home,” “church,” and “clinic” were among the many terms descriptive of a 
place of rest used by contributors to suggest the healing power that the little gallery 
seems to have possessed.156 Other writers went even farther than Hapgood and 
described “291” as an “up-side-down house,” or as as a “modern ‘Cour de Miracles,’ 
where kings can be found in beggars’ clothes.” 157 Frequently, the difference between 


“291” and the American mainstream was imaged in spatial terms, as the gallery was

contrasted with the busy street below.158 Despite their similarity, many of the replies 
that remarked on the difference between “291” and the larger American culture were 
nevertheless quite personal and heartfelt, often forming short testimonials to the effect 
that Stieglitz and “291” had on contributors’ lives. Oscar Bluemner, for example, 
recounted how, after coming to the United States, he had given up painting altogether, 
along with all hope for the future of art in America, which he described as a land where 
“all things especially artistic ones, pale into utter insignificance before...the great 
stomach-question, the mark of which is $---.”159 One day, however, while walking the 
New York streets, he noticed a small sign in a doorway that read, “Photo-Secession.” 
Bluemner entered the establishment, struck up a conversation with the proprietor, and, 
after some initial skepticism, realised that Stieglitz was an exception to the American 


norm. “On that day,” he wrote, “it dawned upon me that there was still hope.” 160 


An unintended consequence of the repeated description of “291” as standing 
apart from the American mainstream was the insinuation that the gallery played an 
essentially passive role in its relationship with the world outside its doors. When the 
gallery was labelled a “refuge,” an “oasis,” or a spiritual “home,” contributors implied 
that “291” was, in fact, not an active force in American culture, but only a place where 
those tired of modern life could seek temporary refreshment. The frequently expressed 
opinion, also found in Hapgood’s contribution, that “291” could not be accurately 
defined, served to reinforce this impression of passivity. For Stieglitz and other “291” 
insiders, disturbed by the gallery’s apparent lack of purpose, this news of its essential 


quietism cannot have been very welcome. 


Fortunately, other contributors were of the opinion that “291” was engaged in a 
more dynamic relationship with the world at large. From this perspective, “291” was 
seen only to be engaging in a temporary retreat from life, the better to rally its forces 


before battle. “291,” they found, was a place of vigorous activity that stood at the all-

important nexus between inner consciousness and outer reality. Some such conviction 
seems to underlie the frequently encountered description of “291” as a “laboratory” and 
an “experimental station.” 161 Use of these analogies implied that “291” took in data 
from the outside, examined and weighed it, then retumed the results to the world for 
the greater benefit of all. More elaborate scientific and technological metaphors had a 
similar import, and suggested that “291” was a powerhouse of transforming energies. 
Helen R. Gibbs, identified as a “teacher of children, and writer” from New York, for 
example, used a bewildering array of scientific images in her attempt to get at the 
gallery’s meaning.!62 “291” for her was 


...a positive electron ever ready to use its powerful dynamic force for the 
destruction of the deadly microbe. Being positive, it cannot be isolated - tho it 
stands alone. It is a strain centre in stable orbital motion round a common 
centre - recognizable and identified. 

The electric waves produced are circulated by Heat, Friction and Action, 
or, if you will, Passion, Thought, and Expression. The works shown at ‘291’ 
are comets which go on their way with all their strength and never make 
apologies, even if their tails should strike the earth. Shock absorbers are not 
necessary, nor are they desired... 


And so the wheel turns on throwing off its electric sparks....163 


Biological analogies were used in a similar fashion to suggest an interplay 
between “291” and something greater than itself. Once again, none of these usages was 
very original to the contributors themselves, but formed part of the lore that had 
accumulated around “291” over the years.!64 Thus, a large number of contributors 
described the gallery as being “alive,” or as “growing.” For artist William Zorach, 
“291” was “a wonderful living place palpitating with red blood,” while [Mrs.] Clifford 
Williams found “291” to be ”a little room where the quality of life one seeks in the 
upstretching of green things, the singing of birds, shows itself thro human beings.”!65 
Assertions such as these implied that “291” was in touch with sources of life not open 
to most Americans, and, more importantly, that the vital energy possessed by the 
gallery was likely to increase and expand beyond its narrow confines. Some 


contributors even described “291” as being in the process of giving birth. Man Ray was

of the opinion that “the gray walls of the little gallery are always pregnant,” while long- 
time associate, Dallett Fuguet, wrote that “291” is the home of ”one by aid of whose 
mental and aesthetic midwifery many enquiring minds have brought forth ideas that 
were new unto themselves” (for a visual example see de Zayas, “L’ Accoucheur 
d’idées” [Fig. 14]).!66 Analogies such as these showed “291” not to be in retreat from 
the world, but as the very place at which the universe came into being. An English 
contributor, photographer Ward Muir, neatly summed up the reciprocal relationship 
with the outside world that these biological metaphors implied. For him, 


Two-Nine-One is like one of those minute specks which a scientist shows 

you, protoplasm or cell or seed or whatever it is, which guards the something in 
them, life, by virtue whereof they grow or subdivide and increase and multiply 
- or sprout into a plant with frail swaying blossoms but a sturdy stem....The 
plant draws its sustenance from outside: only from inside comes the power of 
its chemistry to transform that sustenance into the flowers or fruit. Now it is the 
same with Two-Nine-One. It is immensely in touch with the world....167 


Replies such as these, even though they were couched in rather familiar terms, must 
have been very reassuring for Stieglitz and his associates. They suggested that “291,” 
despite its difficulties, was still a vital and active force that had a significant influence 


on the world, at least at the artistic and spiritual levels. 


Some sense of unease, however, can perhaps be discerned in the responses 
submitted by certain members of the inner circle at the gallery. Paul Haviland, for 
example, like many other contributors, wrote at length about the lack of definition that 
seemed to permeate the idea of “291.” For Haviland, the gallery 


...teaches nothing, for the professorial attitude is contrary to its spirit. It is made 
up of heterogeneous elements, representing conflicting and irreconcilable points 


of view with all of which no one man could ever agree.168 


He found that he could not say what “291” means to him because 


it has meant something different, something new, every time I have come into 
contact with it. It will continue to mean new things to me for it is alive. There is 


one definite thing which I can always depend on finding there: Opportunity.169 


Haviland meant his remarks to be complimentary, but his inability to describe the

gallery very accurately left the impression that it was lacking in a certain energy and 
purpose. In his contribution, Marius de Zayas was able to be somewhat more precise, 
but also implied that he was not entirely happy with the way things were going. De 
Zayas made use of the occasion to set out his own philosophical and methodological 
point of view, a position that was, in some respects, at odds with the idealistic ways of 
thinking common in the Stieglitz circle. He belonged, de Zayas asserted, 


to that class that Carlyle describes as ‘cause and effect speculators,’ a class for 
whom no wonder remains wonderful, but all things in Heaven and Earth must 
be accounted for. This mental attitude is, indeed, not at all romantic, but to my 


belief just as good or just as bad as any other.!70 


In de Zayas’ opinion, “291”’s primary purpose was scientific. Its rooms were, he 
wrote, “a Gallery of Effects to be taken as points of departure to get at the Causes and 
at the Mechanism.”!71 Although de Zayas’ remarks were very brief, he began, by 
means of comments such as these, to suggest that “291” should take its investigative 
responsibilities seriously and start to operate more like a real ‘laboratory.’ Like Paul 
Haviland, he also had trouble saying just what “291” is. Although he wrote that “291” 
was “not an Idea nor an Ideal, but something more potent, a Fact, something 
accomplished,” he also found it to be “by no means final or conclusive, but much to the 
contrary.”!72 In the paragraph dealing with Stieglitz, moreover, de Zayas seemed to 
regret the gallery’s self-imposed limits: 


291. Expression of the Present brought out by one man, to keep in constant 
evidence the spirit of the time, apparently, only in its artistic production and in 


its artistic judgment. 173 
In 1915, de Zayas’ misgivings concerning the course “291” was pursuing would 
become more public, and he would, by means of 291 magazine and other projects, 


attempt both to establish the gallery’s identity more firmly and to broaden its horizons. 


Anxiety concerning “291”’s nature and purpose, only hinted at in the 
contributions by Haviland and de Zayas, was more overt in the lengthy response 


submitted by Eduard Steichen, Stieglitz’s old colleague in the running of the gallery.

This piece, which can only be described as a tirade, took “291” severely to task for 
having failed to show any significant progress since the Armory Show. Despite its 
perspicacity, the critique probably should not be taken entirely at face value. When it 
was written, Steichen was still very much under the influence of Symbolist aesthetics, 
and therefore hostile to Cubism and the other radical styles that had come to prevail at 
the gallery. Because of these aesthetic differences he had, much to his annoyance, been 
shut out of many “291” activities. Steichen and Stieglitz, moreover, had also had 
serious differences of opinion with regard to the European war, which had begun late 
in August of 1914, only shortly before Steichen wrote his contribution. In spite of his 
distaste for Cubism, Steichen was a staunch Francophile, while Stieglitz admired 
Germany above all nations and found it difficult to blame that country for the war. 
Steichen’s response, then, may have been written in the heat of the moment and been 


partly motivated by personal considerations.!74 Whatever the case, the analysis he 
offered of the gallery’s problems and prospects was nevertheless timely and insightful. 
He led off his contribution with a heated denunciation of the “What ‘291’ means to me” 
issue itself, which, he believed, had served only to tum the gallery’s attention inward. 
“T resent this inquiry into its meaning as being impertinent, egoistic and previous,” he 
wrote. “Previous in so far as it makes the process resemble an obituary or an inquest, 
and because it further tends to establish a precedent in the form of a past.”!75 He 


claimed that the process of ossification at “291” had been going on for some time and 
that recently the gallery had contributed nothing new in either art or ideas. 


During the past year, possibly two years, ‘291’ has seemed to me to be 
merely marking time. It had obviously reached a result in one of its particular 
efforts and had accomplished a definite result within itself and for itself; - and 
for the public at large it had laid the way for others to successfully organize the 
big International Exhibition of Modem Art held at the Armory in 1913. 

Whether it was the discouragement that follows achievement, or a desire 
to cling to success and permanently establish its value, or merely a consequent 
inertia caused by the absence of new or vital creative forces I am not prepared to 


discuss here - but “291” was not actively a living issue.176 


Steichen’s greatest complaint, however, was that “291” had not responded adequately

If ever there came, within our time, a psychological element of universal 
consequence that could rouse individuals out of themselves as individuals and 


grip humanity in its very entrails, surely it was this one.177 
Instead, “291” had “continued the process of producing a book about itself - and calmly 
conitinued its state of marking time.”!78 Steichen’s contribution, then, faulted “291” 
for failing to maintain those very links with the contemporary world that were of such 
importance to “291” insiders, and which were an object of considerable praise among 
the other contributors. Although his comments may have been sparked by a 
disagreement with Stieglitz, they transcended their immediate context to offer a critique 
of the self-accusing and inward-looking tendency of recent years, one example of 
which had been the protracted debate about art’s relevance conducted in the pages of 
Camera Work. Like de Zayas, Steichen, even as he recognised the value of “291”’s 
“receptivity,” saw a need for the gallery to assume a more distinct identity and to play a 


more active role in affairs. 


In so far as the “What ‘291’ means to me” issue of Camera Work attempted to 
define “291” with somewhat greater clarity, preparation of the volume was, of course, 
itself an effort to confront the indecisiveness that Steichen had condemned and that 
seemed to threaten the gallery’s continued effectiveness. Moreover, whatever its 
shortcomings, the issue was effective advertising for “291” and, as such, served to 
involve it more directly in the New York art world. Preparation of the volume, which 
extended over several months, itself brought the gallery to the renewed attention of 
some of the most important figures in New York art and literary circles, many of 
whom, as we have seen, used the occasion to describe its activities in the most glowing 
terms. Although it is hard to determine just how widely the issue was distributed, it 
must have been read by a large proportion of persons involved in those same circles, 
and was even reviewed appreciatively in the metropolitan dailies. Arthur Hoeber, for 


example, the conservative critic who participated in the project, wrote a favourable

review of the volume for the New York Globe in which he observed that contributors 


had expressed a “deep appreciation for the freedom of thought and the liberty offered to 


the exhibitors,” and that “a note of friendliness, even affection for the promoter, Mr. 
Stieglitz,” was much in evidence.!79 For the more general reader the “What ‘291’ 


means to me” issue presented a singularly kind and democratic picture of “291” that 
would certainly have increased its popular appeal. Although the ranks of contributors 
were made up mainly of artists and critics, they also included persons from much more 
ordinary occupations and social situations, thus implying that participation in “291” 
was open to a wide variety of individuals. The candid and open-ended manner in which 
the discussion was conducted, moreover, informed readers that the gallery was 
receptive to a range of ideas and views. The opinion, expressed by many contributors, 
that “291” stood in opposition to the spiritual malaise of modern America promised 
readers that attendance at the gallery would involve them in activities that were not 
merely a pleasant diversion, but that were of crucial importance to the improvement of 
society. The scientific and technological jargon used, further suggested, in the manner 


of de Zayas’ essays, that “291” was an undertaking of some seriousness and relevance. 


While the “What ‘291’ means to me” issue of Camera Work projected an image 
of the gallery that would have been attractive to many people, in the end, however, the 
volume failed to accomplish many of the tasks that Stieglitz had set out for it. Although 
he had hoped that the responses submitted would provide new insights into the nature 
of “291,” and that he would obtain from them some idea of what remained to be done, 
the published replies dealt mainly in the kinds of generalities that had been typical of 
Camera Work for years, and said little about the gallery that had not been said before. 
Significantly, the volume contained only limited discussion of modem art itself, and, 
beyond the observation that “291” had no part in the “immoral American Goldhunt,” 


did not offer concrete explanations of how “291” was relevant to the moder age or 


how it might lead the way to a better future.180 Although the occasional writer

contrasted “291” with the “houses of art prostitution,” more extended discussions of 
the gallery’s place in the New York and intemational art worlds did not appear.!81 The 
absence of such discussions is, in fact, not very surprising, given the nature of the 
project and of the question that had been set. Stieglitz’s request for an appraisal of the 
gallery seems to have been taken by most contributors as an invitation to write only 
about the “meanings” of “291” that had already been firmly established. Because the 
definition of the institution had, in the past, been deliberately kept vague, it was 
probably to be expected that the main thing Stieglitz learned about “291” was that one 
could not say what it was. It is also not surprising, given Stieglitz’s own repeated 
identification of himself with the gallery, that most of the respondents maintained that 
“291” and Alfred Stieglitz were, in fact, much the same thing.!82 In the end, for 
Stieglitz, the “What ‘291’ means to me” issue must have come to seem almost like a 
house of mirrors, where he could see his own reflection at every tum, and where his 
own words were repeated back to him unchanged. Because the volume dealt with the 
business at hand in such a self-reflexive manner, it ultimately formed, not a solution to 
the predicament in which Stieglitz and his associates found themselves, but a part of the 


problem itself. 


Marius de Zayas in Paris 


Marius de Zayas’ response to the problems faced by “291” in 1914 took shape 
during the course of a trip to France in the summer of that year. Renewal of his 
association with the Parisian avant-garde at this time was artistically and intellectually 
invigorating for de Zayas and seems to have brought about a restoration of his faith in a 
forward-looking modemism and in the importance of the work “291” was doing. The 
personal contacts and intellectual discoveries that he made in Paris also had a 
considerable effect on the course the gallery was to pursue in the following year, and 


led directly to the publication of 291 magazine. Fortunately, the letters de Zayas and

Stieglitz exchanged during this summer are preserved at Yale University and in the files 
of Rodrigo de Zayas in Spain.183 This correspondence, which has not been adequately 
examined in the literature, offers considerable insight into the purpose of the trip and its 


outcome. 184 


De Zayas arrived in Paris on May 13, 1914, and returned to New York on or 
just before September 12.185 Although most of his visit was spent in Paris, de Zayas 
may also have made a brief side trip to England and seems to have made frequent visits 
to Voulangis, Eduard Steichen’s country place, in the company of Katherine Rhoades, 
Agnes Meyer, Marion Beckett, Constantin Brancusi, and Steichen himself. The aims of 
de Zayas’ European sojoum appear to have been quite numerous. Ostensibly 
undertaken in order to fulfil a commission from Puck magazine to execute caricatures of 
important European artists and writers, de Zayas’ overriding purpose, however, was to 
reestablish his contacts with the Parisian avant-garde after an absence of over two 
years.186 Several important developments, including Picasso’s “synthetic” phase, the 
advent of Futurism, and the rise of abstraction as an important artistic tendency had all 
taken place since his last visit and he obviously had much catching up do do. Such 
periodic tours of Europe for the purpose of artistic renewal were, in fact, common 
practice for the members of the Stieglitz circle, as they were among American artists 
and intellectuals generally. In 1914, however, such a trip had an unusual urgency for 
de Zayas and Stieglitz. The two men seem to have realised that if the declining fortunes 
of “291” were to be reversed, the gallery would have to establish closer ties with the 
sources of the modern movement with which it was so closely identified. Increased 
competition from the “commercial” galleries in New York, moreover, made the 
acquisition of European art for display at “291” of the utmost importance. Without a 
substantial amount of recent work by acknowledged European masters on the walls of 


the gallery during the winter Stieglitz ran the very real risk of presenting yet another

But de Zayas also had some more personal artistic and professional reasons for 
making the trip to France. Like many advanced American artists he often found it hard 
to maintain his modemist faith in the face of philistine opposition and the perceived 
threat from American commercial culture, and looked on visits to the more enlightened 
countries of Europe as a means of spiritual resuscitation. Although de Zayas possessed 
a substantial commitment to “291” and art in America, he had a greater love for things 
European, and, when in Europe, seems to have been at his best, both emotionally and 
intellectually.188 De Zayas’ art and ideas, moreover, despite their considerable 
sophistication, were ultimately derived from European models and he must have hoped 
that renewed contact with the Parisian avant-garde would provide him with further 
creative inspiration. As we have seen, in 1913 and 1914, de Zayas’ scientifically based 
art had fallen into some disrepute at “291” and he probably travelled to Paris in the 
expectation that his work would find there the appreciative audience it lacked at home. 


De Zayas was not to be disappointed. Shortly after his arrival in Paris he got in 
touch with his old friend, Francis Picabia, who soon introduced him to Guillaume 
Apollinaire and the artists and writers of his circle. In 1914, Apollinaire was perhaps 
the best person for an aspiring modernist to know in Paris. The French poet and critic 
was erudite, articulate, and intensely interested in a variety of modem artistic and 
literary activities. As editor of a monthly periodical, Les Soirées de Paris, and arts 
reporter for a number of widely distributed Parisian magazines, Apollinaire was also a 
skillful promoter of work that he thought important. In recent years, Apollinaire had 
championed the abstract art of Delaunay, Picabia and others, which he had defined and 
categorised under the heading of “Orphism.”!89 In mid-1914, however, he was 


attempting to subsume a number of recent avant-garde tendencies into a new 


movement, labelled “Simultanism,” of which he offered his own “calligrammes” as the

prime example. The calligrammes were little “total” works of art that combined lines of 
poetry into evocative pictorial forms in the hope that such simultaneous stimulation of 
the senses might suggest the true ambience of modem life [Fig. 19: “Voyage”].19 At 
the time, Apollinaire was eager to embrace work that seemed to have points in common 
with his own artistic programme, including that of interesting artists from the United 
States. 


De Zayas and Apollinaire seem to have become friends quickly and the French 
critic soon made efforts to introduce the caricaturist to the Parisian public. On May 25, 
1914, Apollinaire enthusiastically announced de Zayas’ arrival in the Paris-Journal: 


M. de Zayas, qui a renouvelé avec un talent exraordinaire ]’art de la * 
caricature et qui introduit en Amérique Picasso et Picabia...se trouve en c& 
moment a Paris, dans le but de faire la caricature des hommes les plus nouveaux 


de tous les arts, la littérature et la musique-!9! 
On July 9, Apollinaire devoted his entire column in the magazine to an appraisal of de 
Zayas’ art. Proclaiming himself to be of the opinion that de Zayas was one of the only 
true caricaturists now active, he noted that his “incredibly powerful” works employed 
“some very new techniques,” and were thus “in accord with the art of the most 
audacious contemporary painters.”!92 Then, in July, de Zayas’ caricatures of 
Apollinaire, Picabia, Stieglitz, and the art dealer Ambrose Vollard appeared in the same 
issue of Les Soirées de Paris that also reproduced four of Apollinaire’s own 
calligrammes [Figs. 3, 4, 15].193 In the same month, de Zayas, Apollinaire, Picabia, 
and composer Albert Savinio commenced collaboration on a pantomime, entitled A_ 


quelle heure un train partira-t-il pour Paris? which, unfortunately, was never 


completed.194 


Not surprisingly, de Zayas and Stieglitz were overjoyed by the prompt and 
enthusiastic reception that de Zayas received in the Apollinaire circle. The letters 


exchanged by the two men were quite frank in this regard, and it is hard not to conclude

that such a response was just what they had sought. Initially, de Zayas seems to have 
approached Apollinaire with some caution, and the correspondence, as a whole, is 
characterised by an awareness that the Americans should maintain a certain amour 
propre in their dealings with him, and that they must not seem overly forward in their 
advances. De Zayas, however, quickly seems to have shown Apollinaire issues of 
Camera Work and, on May 26/27, wrote Stieglitz asking him to send copies of the 
magazine to “people who count,” most especially Apollinaire.195 In the same letter, de 
Zayas described for Stieglitz the manner in which he had approached the Apollinaire 
group: 


It must be understood that when I speak to people like those [sic] of ‘Les 
Soirées de Paris’... about ‘291,’ I only try to establish a friendship and by no 
means any relationship that might appear like if [sic] we were looking for 


correspondents or protection of any kind.196 


Stieglitz replied on June 9: 


Above all I will be only too glad to know Apollinaire gets [Camera Work]. I 
would have sent copies to him long ago, but I did not want to make it look as if 
we wanted to get something out of him. You know how easily decent motives 
are misconstrued even by the most decent of people. But now that you have 
brought about the connection between “291” and those [sic] little crowd we are 


not so apt to be misunderstood.!97 
On July 1, 1914, de Zayas informed Stieglitz that “the last word in art in Paris is 
‘Simultanism’ in literature,” and that “Apollinaire is the father of it.”198 De Zayas 
seemed most impressed by the French poet, whom he described as “really the deepest 
observer of superficiality,” and remarked that “we have become good friends.”199 A 
letter written by de Zayas a week later is the most explicit concerning his motives in 


“establishing a friendship.” 


I am working hard in making these people understand the convenience of a 
commerce of ideas with America. And I want to absorb the spirit of what they 
are doing to bring it to ‘291.’ We need closer contact with Paris. There is no 


question about it.200 
Apollinaire, it seems, had just asked him for some caricatures to be published in Les_ 


Soirées de Paris, and de Zayas was quite beside himself with joy. He wrote to Stieglitz

It is perhaps no coincidence that the caricatures reproduced in Les Soirées de Paris 
juxtaposed Apollinaire, the leader of the Parisian avant-garde, with Stieglitz, the 


champion of the modern movement in America. 


The positive response accorded to de Zayas’ in Paris during the summer of 
1914 was, no doubt, motivated by the Apollinaire circle’s genuine enthusiasm for the 
man and his work. De Zayas was an intelligent and articulate cosmopolitan, well able to 
appreciate the work of the French avant-garde and to participate readily in its activities. 
His own strange and highly abstracted caricatures, in fact, had much in common with 
the recent productions of European movements, especially the art of the Futurists.202 
De Zayas’ work appeared, in the manner of Simultanism, to combine a variety of 
materials to attain a completeness that transcended the limitations of any one medium. It 
seems likely, however, that the fact of de Zayas’ American origins also played a part in 
the warm welcome he received. The United States and its culture were the objects of 
considerable curiosity in Paris just before World War I, and most especially so, it 
appears, in the Apollinaire circle.203 Les Soirées de Paris, as part of its efforts to report 
on the activities of the international avant-garde, published a considerable amount of 
American poetry, including work by William Carlos Williams, H. D., and John Gould 
Fletcher.204 Even more interesting for the editors of the magazine, however, were the 
productions of American popular culture. Maurice Reynal, in his column on the 
contemporary cinema, reviewed American movies with enthusiasm, usually praising 
American action pictures above all others.205 The same issue of the magazine that 
reproduced de Zayas’ abstract caricatures also published an article on American boxers 
and yet another on the American passion for baseball, which the author preferred to 


French sport “4 cause de toute les qualités d’énergie, de vitesse et de sang-froid qu’ il

développe chez ses joueurs.”206 The most interesting, and perhaps the most revealing 
of these articles, however, was one by Harrison Reeves on American popular novels, 
published in the March, 1914 issue.207 Reeves expressed surprise that Harvard 
professors only took it upon themselves to write learned essays on obscure European 
subjects, while neglecting such native gems as the Nick Carter books, in his opinion, a 
much more authentic form of American expression.208 Reeves observed that such 
novels, although worthy of considerable praise, were, in fact, only appreciated by the 


American lower classes and looked down on by those with pretensions to culture as 
nothing but “un poison pour l’esprit des enfants.”209 Tellingly, Reeves found that only 


educated Europeans were able to discern what was truly vital in American culture: 


Il n’est pas étonnant que M. Day, ou quiconque a écrit Nick Carter, ait souffert 
du mépris qui plus tard retomba sur Walt Whitman, qui a souffert comme étant 
trop sauvage pour les Etats-Unis et qui a été oblige de chercher & étre apprécié’ 
en Angleterre avec Algernon Charles Swinbume, Oscar Wilde et les autres 
personnes qui ont eu ‘a souffrir qui a ete une des causes les plus considérables 
parmi celles qui ont retardé le développement intellectuel du Nouveau 


Monde.210 


The implication here, as in other articles on the United States published by Les Soirees 
de Paris, was that Europeans, and most especially members of the Apollinaire circle, 
were better able to appreciate American culture than Americans themselves. By means 
of these articles, Apollinaire and his associates sought to identify themselves with the 
vitality and modemity they believed to be inherent in American popular culture while, at 
the same time, reserving for themselves the prerogative of judging its worth. In the 


end, what was most important in this relationship was the privilege of choosing and the 


power that went with it.211 


Because de Zayas was a representative of American high culture, he could not 
provide quite the same benefits that Apollinaire and his associates were able to derive 
from their appreciation of baseball and popular novels. Some of the same 


condescending attitude on the part of Apollinaire, however, was probably present in

their relationship as well. The French poet and critic, as the would-be “impresario” of 
the avant-garde, was eager to play the arbiter of taste to anyone willing to follow his 
lead, and could be quite merciless to those who would not.2!2 The articles on American 
poets published by Les Soirées de Paris played this judging game with ease, and often 
took special care to point out the French origins of avant-garde innovations used by 
foreigners.213 A gain, as in the case of popular culture, it was Apollinaire and his 
friends who made the work by virtue of their public approval. When de Zayas appeared 
on the scene, Apollinaire, who must already have known about him through Picabia, 
seems to have jumped at the chance to bring a representative of the most important 
American modemist group into conformity. In this way, de Zayas became, at least 


temporarily, a member of the “Apollinaire circle.” 


De Zayas’ rapid entry into the Apollinaire circle, however, probably had some 
more pragmatic causes as well. The American caricaturist, as agent for a well-known 
New York art gallery, would have been of considerable interest to Parisian artists and 
writers because of the exhibition and patronage opportunities that he presented. There is 
considerable evidence to suggest, moreover, that Apollinaire and his associates were 
under some misconception regarding the size of the American market for modem work, 
and about the importance of “291.” News of the success of the Armory Show had 
quickly reached Paris as well, and had reinforced the already strong French impression 
of the United States as a land of extraordinary wealth. Marcel Duchamp’s Cubo- 
Futurist canvases, which had found few buyers in France, had rapidly sold at the 
Armory Show and for relatively high prices. Francis Picabia had, of course, attended 
the Show in person and brought back glowing reports of American affluence and 
generosity. The magazine La Vie Parisienne reported on May 3, 1913, that Picabia had 
retumed to Paris “enchanted with the land of dollars,” and had talked with enthusiasm 
about the sale of paintings “brushed in half a day.”2!4 It is perhaps hardly surprising 


that when de Zayas, friend of the owner of the famous “291” gallery, appeared in

Paris, Apollinaire, forever short of cash, gave him such a warm reception. There is also 
some evidence that Apollinaire believed Stieglitz to be somewhat more wealthy and 
influential than was actually the case. On July 25, 1914, Apollinaire disclosed in the 


Paris-Journal that the pantomime he was producing in collaboration with de Zayas was, 


in fact, intended for performance in the United States.215 In Souvenirs de la Grande 


Guerre, probably written late in 1914, he elaborated on this point: 


En attendant le 25 [juillet] je fus sur Je point d’aller avec Picabia et Zayas 
a Etival ou ils allaient chez Picabia pour préparer les décors. Car la pantomime 
devait tre jouée au mois de janvier a New york et j’y aurais étre aussi. On se 
promettait grand, succes. Les frais devaient €tre faits par Stieglitz qui serait 
facilement rentré dans ses fonds 4 cause de la curiosité que nos noms auraient 


excitée a Manhattan sur les bords de 1’Hudson.216 
Other projects, including an exhibition of Apollinaire’s calligrammes at “291,” and a 
New York concert by Albert Savinio, were also planned for the following year and 
seem similarly predicated upon Stieglitz’s patronage.2!7 While neither of these 
endeavours came to fruition, some other French-American joint ventures, most notably 
291 magazine, were more successful. Whether de Zayas and Stieglitz were aware of 
pecuniary motives on the part of Apollinaire is not clear, but one suspects they were, 
and that, provided they received something in return, were not averse to being used. De 
Zayas and Stieglitz, moreover, were, as always, eager to help guide innocent 


Europeans through the labyrinth of American corruption. 


The other major purpose of de Zayas’ trip, to acquire works of art in Europe for 
display at “291,” was also very successful. As noted in the previous section, de Zayas 
suffered some initial disappointment when he discovered that D. H. Kahnweiler had 
given the Washington Square Gallery New York rights to Picasso’s recent 
production.218 Fortunately, de Zayas was able to obtain art by Picasso and Braque 
from Picabia’s private collection, and Picabia also allowed “291” to exhibit his latest 


works, four large striking abstract canvases.219 De Zayas, in fact, had so much art to

choose from in Paris that he could advise Stieglitz not to show Marie Laurencin, on the 
grounds that her work was derivative and that she was “doing exactly what Davies and 
his bunch did with ‘Cubism.’”220 Ironically, it was the outbreak of World War I late in 
August of 1914 that assured the success of de Zayas’ expedition. The war had the 
effect of drastically curtailing artistic and intellectual activity in Paris as important artists 
and writers, including Apollinaire, joined the armed forces or went into exile.221 The 
Paris art market went into an immediate decline, and artists and dealers soon looked to 
the United States and other countries for new commercial outlets. These developments, 
were, of course, much to the advantage of “291,” and de Zayas seems to have taken 
careful stock of the situation. In addition to the works by Picasso, Braque and Picabia 
already obtained, he now found that dealer Pau] Guillaume was eager to let him have as 
much African sculpture as he could pack into his trunks.222 On his return to New 
York, de Zayas wrote to Stieglitz in triumph that he had arrived 


not flying but retreating, and with all the honours of the war, for I brought with 
myself the pictures of Picasso, Braque and Picabia...[and] fifteen of the best 
negro thing [sic] that has ever been brought to the civilised races(?) [sic]223 


He went on to explain what the war meant for Europe and America: 


I left France, and especially Paris in a very bad situation. Since the war started, 
it seemed that all intellectuality had been withered out. I believe that this war 
will kill many moder artists and unquestionably modern art. It was time, 
otherwise modern art would have killed humanity. But what satisfies me is that 


at least we will be able to have the last word.224 


For de Zayas the war seemed to offer a sudden, serendipitous solution to all of “291”’s 
problems, and to provide an opportunity to erect New York in place of Paris as the 
centre of modem activity. The work that de Zayas brought back from France was 


exhibited at “291” under his direction, and had the effect of making the shows of the 


1914-15 season the most ambitious and startling at the gallery since 1913.225 


De Zayas seems to have returned to New York in September of 1914 with 


sufficiently increased professional and personal prestige to be able to assume a

predominant role in “291” affairs for the next year. Contact with Apollinaire and his 
circle seems also to have provided him with a renewed confidence in his own abilities 
and in the worth of the modern movement generally. In 1915, de Zayas produced some 
of the most innovative work of his career, much of it possessing an avant-garde edge 
that gave it points in common with the most recent tendencies in Paris. As if to celebrate 
de Zayas’ return to New York, and mark his ascendancy in the Stieglitz circle, de 
Zayas’ art and ideas were given pride of place in the October 1914 Camera Work, with 
the exception of the “Means to me” Special Number, the last issue of the magazine to 
appear for almost two years. This issue, which represents the beginning of yet another 
change in the gallery’s intellectual and aesthetic position, reproduced no less than ten of 
de Zayas’ Material and Absolute (realist and abstract) caricatures [Figs. 3-8], 
accompanied by a reprint of the catalogue essay he had wnitten for his 1913 exhibition, 
and by a new article on de Zayas’ work by Paul Haviland. The issue was also unusual 
in that it contained a substantial amount of poetry, all of it by women.226 This kind of 
combination of art and literature in one volume foreshadowed a similar interdisciplinary 
inclination on the part of 291 magazine, of which de Zayas was to be de facto editor. 
Publication of work, such as the poem by S. S. S., that dealt with problems faced by 


women in modern society, also anticipated the contents of 291.227 


The only aesthetically conservative piece of work published in the October 1914 
issue was yet another essay by John Weichsel, the last he was allowed to contribute to 
the publications of the “291” circle. In this essay, entitled “Artists and Others,” 
Weichsel expanded his ideas concerning the pernicious influence of science on art and 
further reprimanded the art audience for its faddish preoccupations. “Art,” Weichsel 
lamented, 


..is degenerating into a form essentially technical. It applies to itself measures 
physical rather than spiritual; it seeks merely external perfection; it is dominated 
by its tools, rules, methods and even whims; it mistakes the symbol for the 


thing; it courts shadows deeming the souls.228

Art aficionados, he found, though knowledgeable, lacked a true understanding of art’s 
meaning: 
They can see the difference between a dry-point and an aquatint as easily as you 
or I can tell a pretzel from a doughnut. They can tell us that Greek art was not at 
all realistic, that Impressionism is no more It, and that a suspicion of objectivity 


is sufficient to hopelessly doom a work of latest art.... They can prove it that 
there isn’t a single decent art periodical in this country, and they read 


Stieglitz’s CAMERA WORK, and keep otherwise up to scratch in art.229 


Weichsel concluded that this flurry of activity served no useful purpose, and that it 
actually did more harm than good: 


Having listened to and lived with these well informed art-adepts, let us ask in all 
seriousness; what has art done for these men and women? What has it done 
through them for others? Did it make them happier or better, individually and 
socially? Did it gratify or ennoble the whole man?... Obviously, art is not now 
in possession of the elixir of life. In fact, it is not at all unlikely that its nectar 


has become virulent in today’s art-atmosphere.230 


As part of the “debate” that had been conducted in Camera Work over the space 
of a year, “Artists and Others” constituted a further attempt to redefine “291”’s 
intellectual position along more traditionalist lines. Weichsel’s article, however, 
although of some length, was eclipsed in the October 1914 issue by the large amount of 
material devoted to Marius de Zayas. Juxtaposition of work by the two men, in fact, 
encourages one to read de Zayas’ art and ideas as a reply to Weichsel, and suggests that 
the volume as a whole was published for the purpose of such a comparison. 
Reproduction of de Zayas’ abstract caricatures, moreover, all of which date from the 
heyday of avant-garde activity at “291” in 1912 and 1913, made a connection between 
the present and that earlier, happier period, thus indicating to readers that the gallery 
would now resume its activities where the spring 1913 exhibitions had left off.231 De 
Zayas, it seems, having obtained proof of their worth from reliable European sources, 
was newly confident that his work could be trusted to act as a signpost for the future, 
and to provide an image of “291” for the benefit of the public. The abstract caricatures, 


moreover, also made a statement about the people who were now important at the

gallery. The caricatures of Stieglitz, Meyer, Picabia, and Haviland together formed a 
group portrait of the luminaries who would dominate “291” activities in the following 


year.232 


The essays that accompanied de Zayas’ caricatures reframed his work using 


some of the ideas that had recently been the subject of so much discussion in Camera 


Work. In his 1913 catalogue essay de Zayas, as we have seen, made the very highest 
claims for his art, maintaining that by means of abstract form and mathematical symbols 
he could communicate the very essence of an individual’s character. That his essay 
merited reprinting a year-and-a-half after its first appearance suggests that de Zayas, in 
spite of the doubts expressed in “Moder Art - Theories and Representations,” still 
believed its conclusions to be valid. Paul] Haviland’s essay, entitled “Marius de Zayas - 
Material, Relative, and Absolute Caricatures,” engaged, with reference to de Zayas’ 
work, some of the most pressing questions of art’s meaning and relevance that had 
been raised by Weichsel and others.233 Following an explanation of de Zayas’ art and 
ideas, Haviland took on the role of devil’s advocate to make Weichsel’s old charge that 


...the greatest handicap of the modern worker in obtaining a hearing from the 
community is that he seeks to manifest his individuality without seeking a 
point of contact with the public.234 


Haviland went on to quote a passage from the little book he had co-authored with de 
Zayas during the period of the Armory Show in 1913, when these issues of community 
had first been raised: 


‘In exclusive individuality the individual works with his own individual 
resources for his own individual self. The moment he excludes himself from the 


feelings of the community, the community excludes itself from his feelings.’235 


Haviland, however, in a passage which is worth quoting at length, maintained that de 
Zayas and his caricatures did not suffer from this fault: 


Marius de Zayas seems to have found a solution to the problem of giving full 
sway to his personal evolution of expression, entering boldly the field of the 
abstract, without losing his point of contact with the community. He has found 
this point of contact in the fact that instead of using abstract form to express

ideas awakened in him by excitation from the outside world, i.e., making his 
ideas the subject of his expression, his subject remains the outside world, the 
people whom he represents, and his personality comes into play only to extract 
from his subject that which is significant. The significant thing is the 
psychology of the subject, not his own psychology, so that when we look at his 
absolute caricatures we think, not of the artist, but of his subject, i.e., the 


outside world represented in its abstract significance.236 


Haviland, like de Zayas in his catalogue essay, also asserted that abstract form could be 
meaningfully used if “abstract” entities alone were represented: 


____ [De Zayas] has avoided the inconsistency of using the abstract 
significance of Form to express concrete ideas. He uses logically abstract Form 


to express abstract characterisation. That is why his work is convincing.237 


The ideas expressed in Paul Haviland’s essay are in striking contrast to the 
crabbed and pessimistic pronouncements on art that de Zayas had made in “Theories 
and Representations.” The essay, which probably reflects de Zayas’ own opinions as 
well, is a return to the position that the most advanced art can have something to say 
about the world beyond the significance of Form, and can have a meaningful place in 
the larger community. Haviland’s comments on “community” indicate, moreover, that 
de Zayas’ caricatures were presented in the October 1914 issue, as they had been in 
1913, in full confidence that they would be understood and appreciated by the public. 
Haviland’s faith in an easy intercourse between the artist’s inner experience and outer 
reality, is, I would speculate, also a gauge of de Zayas’ own changing relationship with 
the world. Publication of the caricatures and accompanying material suggests that de 
Zayas now had sufficient faith in himself and his art to explore concerns extemal to the 
work of art itself, not only at the artistic level but in his professional life as well. This 
change in attitude was probably the result of his association with Apollinaire, who, as 
we have seen, had had nothing but praise for de Zayas’ art, and who was also in the 
process of a similar rethinking of the relationship between poetic self and objective 
reality.238 Read as part of an ongoing discourse regarding “291”’s relationship with the 


world outside its doors, moreover, Haviland’s essay, and the contents of the October

Notes 


1. On the Armory show and its aftermath see Milton W. Brown, The Story of the 
Armory Show, 2d ed. (New York: Abbeville Press, 1988); Judith Zilczer, “‘The 
World’s New Art Center’: Modem Art Exhibitions in New York City, 1913-1918;” 
Archives of American Art 14 (1974): 2-7. Judith Tolnick, “Collecting American 
Modernism and Modernists,” in Over Here: Modernism, The First Exile 1914-1919, 
ed. Kermit Champa (Providence: David Winton Bell Gallery, 1989), 43-58. Zilczer 
notes that “between 1913 and 1918, thirty four New York galleries, organisations, and 
private clubs sponsored approximately 250 exhibitions of American and European 
painting and sculpture regarded by the public as ‘modern’ or progressive.’” Zilczer, 
“Art’s Center,” 2. 


2. The literature on Stieglitz and “291” is vast if somewhat unsatisfactory. The standard 
study of the Stieglitz circle is William Innes Homer, Alfred Stieglitz and the American 
Avant-Garde. (Boston: New York Graphic Society, 1977). Although quite 
comprehensive it tends to exaggerate the importance of Stieglitz’s role in the 
introduction of modem art to America, and to treat his activities somewhat uncritically. 
Sue Davidson Lowe, Stieglitz: A Memoir/Biography, (New York: Farrar Straus 
Giroux, 1983), written by Stieglitz’s niece, is the best biography, but is marred by a 
similar hagiographic quality. A more jaundiced view of Stieglitz can be found in 
Timothy Rodgers, “False Memories: Alfred Stieglitz and the Development of the 
Nationalist Aesthetic,” in Over Here: Modernism, The First Exile 1914-1919, ed. 
Kermit Champa (Providence: David Winton Bell Gallery, 1989), 59-66. For Stieglitz’s 
work as a cultural critic see Edward Abrahams, The Lyrical Left: Randolph Bourne, 
Alfred Stieglitz, and the Origins of Cultural Radicalism in America (Charlottesville: 
University Press of Virginia, 1986) For an account of Stieglitz’s publications see 
Dickran Tashjian, Skyscraper Primitives (Middleton, Conn.: Wesleyan University 
Press, 1975). Other important references on Stieglitz include Bram Dijkstra, The_ 
Hieroglyphics of a New Speech (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969); William 
Innes Homer, ed. Avant-Garde Painting and Sculpture in America, 1910-25 
(Wilmington, Del.: Delaware Art Museum, 1975); Ileana Leavens, From 291 to Zurich: 
The Birth of Dada (Ann Arbor: UMI Research Press, 1983); and Dorothy Norman, 
Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer (New York: Random House, 1973). 


3. On Stieglitz’s “laboratory”: Homer, Alfred Stieglitz, 79-80. 


4. For a discussion of Stieglitz’s “method” see Homer, Alfred Stieglitz, 48. For an 
example of the kind of conversation Stieglitz conducted with visitors see Marius de 


Zayas and Paul B. Haviland, A Study of the Modern Evolution of Plastic Expression 
(New York: “291,” 1913), 16-18. 


5. With reference to Stieglitz’s cultural mission Edward Abrahams comments: “He saw 
himself as a spiritual leader whose mission was to guide the American people out of 
what he believed was a desert of materialism, misplaced priorities, and misguided 
behavior and into the Promised Land. Stieglitz, never a believer in using language 
precisely, did not define the promised land, but for him, ‘Truth,’ Life,’ ‘Spirit,’ and 
‘291’ were some of its many names...” Abrahams, Lyrical Left, 95-209. See also 
Homer, Alfred Stieglitz, 77-78.

9. I am indebted here to Timothy Rodgers scathing critique of Stieglitz’s activities. 
Rodgers finds that use of words such as “ideal,” truth,” and “spiritual,” “allowed 
Stieglitz and his sycophants to elevate and defend their ill-defined activities... More 
specifically, these words helped writers published in Camera Work to advance their 
favorable opinions of modem art despite their inability to communicate precisely what 
were the underlying principles that informed the art. For American artists such as 
Marin, these notions allowed them to avoid analytical thought and systematic 
procedures in their attempts to come to terms with European art, while sheltering from 
criticism their art of imitation.” Rodgers, “False Memories,” 60-61. A similar 
examination of Stieglitz’s pretensions to photographic originality can be found in Ulrich 
F. Keller, “The Myth of Art Photography: An Iconographic Analysis,” History of 
Photography 9, no. 1 (January-March 1985): 1-38; and Ulrich Keller,“The Myth of Art 
Photography: A Sociological Analysis.” History of Photography 8, no. 4 (October-

19. The public for exhibitions at “291” and the audience toward which promotional 
efforts were directed in 1913 is hard to define with great accuracy. Although many of 
the persons who frequented the gallery were artists and artistic hangers-on, “291” 
seems also to have attracted to itself a large number of curiosity seekers from a variety 
of walks of life, and it was these people who seem to have had the greatest importance 
for Stieglitz. Although his estimate that 167,000 persons visited “291” between 1905 
and 1912 is probably an exaggeration, the gallery seems to have been quite crowded 
during controversial exhibitions, such as that of work by Matisse in 1911. My point in 
this section of the thesis is that Stieglitz and his associates believed the Armory Show 
had pointed to the existence of a potentially large audience for modem art in New York 
City, and that “291” activities in 1913 were organised with the intention of appealing to 
and defining this inscrutable public. Stieglitz made the estimate in an interview for the 
New York Evening Sun, April 27, 1912. Quoted in Norman, Alfred Stieglitz, 114- 
115. 


20. Francis Picabia, “How I See New York,” New York American 30 March 1913, 
magazine section, 11. The interview is reprinted in Maria Lluisa Borras, Picabia (New 
York: Rizzolli, 1985), 110-11.

York can be found in William Camfield, Francis Picabia (Princeton: Princeton 
University Press, 1979):40-56. 


23. This point is actually made by Oscar Bluemner in Bluemner, “Audiator,” 26 


24. Paul Haviland “Notes on ‘291,’” Camera Work 42-43 (April-July, 1913, published

25. Francis Picabia, “Preface,” Camera Work 42-43 (April-July, 1913, published 
November 1913), 20. The preface and its influence in the United States are discussed 
in Camfield, Francis Picabia, 51-56. Tashjian notes that Picabia's arguments were 
“couched in moderate language possibly in order to appeal to a conservative public.” 


Tashjian, Skyscraper Primitives, 21. 


26. “Abstraction” seems to have had quite a wide range of meaning in the Stieglitz 
circle, and could refer to a highly conventionalised art, such as Picasso’s Cubism, that 
retained some references to subject matter, as well as to completely non-representational 
work. See Judith Zilczer, “The Aesthetic Struggle in America, 1913-1918, Abstract Art 
and Theory in the Stieglitz Circle” (Ph.D. diss., University of Delaware, 1975), 169. 


27. Two pieces by Gertrude Stein, entitled “Henri Matisse,” and “Pablo Picasso,” had 
already been published in Camera Work Special Number (August 1912), 23-30. 


28. A comprehensive analysis of Camera Work does not exist. Dickran Tashjian in 
Skyscraper Primitives, 15-28, attempts to show that Camera Work, by means of

discussions of the “anti-art” of photography, was engaged in a discourse concerning 
the broader meaning of art. He also discusses, albeit briefly, articles by de Zayas, 
Casseras, and others. Roger Piatt Hull in “Camera Work, An American Quarterly” 
(Ph.D. diss., Northwestern University, 1970), provides a short history of the 
magazine and similarly reviews work by the major contributors. See also Jonathan 
Green, Camera Work: A Critical Anthology (Millerton, N. Y.: Aperture, Inc., 1973). 
Subscribers to Camera Work appear to have been a varied lot, and included many 
photographers, and a large number of Europeans. See the analysis of one of the few 
surviving subscription lists in Hull, “Camera Work,” 43-44. Most likely, many issues 
were given away, or loaned to individuals by Stieglitz and his associates.

with de Zayas’ art and his aesthetic relation to Picabia. Craig R, Bailey, “The Art of 
Marius de Zayas,” Arts Magazine, 53, no.1, (September 1978), 136-44 is another 
broad survey that provides useful biographical information. De Zayas has been the 
subject of at least one comprehensive exhibition that also produced a catalogue: Douglas 
Hyland, Marius de Zayas: Conjurer of Souls (Lawrence: Spencer Museum of Art, 
1981). De Zayas’ own memoir of these years, “How, When, and Why Modem Art 
Came to New York,” intro. and notes by Francis M. Naumann, Arts Magazine 54, no. 
8 (April 1980), 96-126, is made up mainly of reprinted reviews and is therefore 
somewhat disappointing. De Zayas’ writings have not been thoroughly examined, but 
see Hull, “Camera Work,” 133-40; Tashjian, Skyscraper Primitives, 23-28; and 
Zilczer, “Aesthetic Struggle,” 132-37. De Zayas has also been the subject of two M.A. 
theses: Leslie Cohen, “Marius de Zayas and the Modern Movement in New York,” 
M.A. thesis, Queens College, CUNY, 1973; and Eva Epp Runk, “Marius de Zayas: 
The New York Years,” M.A. thesis, University of Delaware, 1973. 


46. Marius de Zayas, “The Sun Has Set,” Camera Work 39 (July 1912), 19-20. 
47. Ibid, 19 


48. Ibid, 21. De Zayas’ argument that modem art is the expression of spiritual 
exhaustion is similar to that made by certain more conservative critics. See Leo Stein, 
“Panic in Art,” The New Republic, 7 November 1914, 20-21. 


49. Bailey finds that de Zayas’ “loose, inchoate positivism,” was “based in part on 
Taine, Spencer, and possibly William James.” Bailey, “Art of Marius de Zayas,” 140. 
Criticism with claims to “scientific” objectivity was common in the period. See Arlene 
Olsen, Art Critics and the Avant-Garde, 1900-1913 (Ann Arbor: UMI Research Press, 
1980),4-7. De Zayas’ theory of art is more complicated than I have been able to suggest 
here. 


50. De Zayas’ theory of art was essentially racist. Although he admired African art, he 
believed it to have been created by a people who “remain in a mental state very similar 
to that of the children of the white race.” Marius de Zayas, African Negro Art and Its 
Influence on Modem Art (New York: Modern Gallery, 1916), 10.

Stieglitz’s lofty spiritual aims.

69. Although the aesthetic theories developed by de Zayas and Picabia have many 
similarities they seem to have arrived at their conclusions separately. The rationale for 
the art of both men depended heavily on the old Symbolist theory of correspondance. 
Willard Bohn argues that both de Zayas’ abstract caricature and Picabia’s machine 
portraits make use of an intermediary object that symbolises the individual portrayed, 
and on which the work of art is based. Bohn believes that de Zayas influenced Picabia 
in this regard. Bohn, “Abstract Vision,” 446-51. I think it likely that Picabia’s example 
encouraged de Zayas to exhibit his caricatures, and to write his catalogue preface. See 
also, Camfield, Francis Picabia, 55-56.

publicity and a spectacular presentation, but it is highly debatable whether the public 
was either profoundly moved or educated.” On the decline at “291”: Homer, Alfred

Stieglitz, 172-73. My account, while based, in its broad outlines, on accounts such 
Homer’s, is more detailed, and attempts to place the writings in Camera Work into a 
pragmatic context. I also believe that Stieglitz did not, in fact, give up his efforts to 
maintain leadership in the New York avant-garde.

1913-1917 are preserved in the ASA. I had hoped to discuss this correspondence more

and Zilczer, “‘World’s New Center,”” 2-7. Tolnick says of collector John Quinn that 
“Quinn was opposed absolutely to what he called the ‘pseudo-Bohemianism’ of 
downtown, that is, of other literary/political/artistic mixed company circles (Mabel 
Dodge’s in particular) that emerged with his, but in Washington Square, and where 
dramatic debate and controversy were relished.” Tolnick, 47. The audience for modern 
art in New York has not been adequately studied.

aspiring middle classes, or, at least the younger sons and daughters of the social elite, 
perhaps to some of their miscellaneous hangers-on -- free love poets, out of pocket 

artists, highly paid courtesans, and many other semi-cultured individuals loose in the 
metropolis.” Douglas, 10-11. See also, Lewis A. Erensberg, Steppin Out: New York 


Nightlife and the Transformation of American Culture, 1890-1930 (Westport, Conn.: 
Greenwood Press, 1981.) 


86. Well known art critic James Huneker wrote a column for the magazine in 1914 and 
1914 entitled “The Seven Arts” that often dealt with modem art. While Puck, strictly 
speaking, was not a “smart magazine,” in 1914 and 1915 the weekly seems to have 
taken aim at a more upscale audience. See Douglas, Smart Magazines, 41-42. 


87. Participation by “291” associates with Puck magazine also constituted another 
attempt to sell “291” and its wares to the public. These efforts were not always 
consistent with the gallery’s anti-commercial stance, nor with its pretensions to artistic 
seriousness. See also note 186.

95. In April 1915, for example, Arthur B. Davies organised an exhibition for the 
Montross galleries that combined modem art and interior decoration. The exhibition, 
which featured work by Davies, William Glackens, Walt Kuhn, Maurice Prendergast, 
Charles Sheeler, and Henry Fitch Taylor, was, according to Judith Zilczer, “indicative 
of the popular application of the modem art ideal to interior design and fashion in the 
years after the Armory Show.” It seems to have attracted considerable attention in New 
York City. Zilczer, “‘World’s Art Center,” 5.

98. Stieglitz could, however, be very kind to dealers, such as Charles Daniel, who 
came to him for advice. See Charles Daniel, “291,” Camera Work Special Number 
(July 1914, published January 1915), 33. Daniel seems to have taken on work by 
several of Stieglitz’s favorite American artists, including John Marin.

100. This “debate” is not discussed in the literature. Roger Piatt Hull notes “the 
frequency with which the breakdown of art was discussed in Camera Work,” but he 
gives only a general overview of the various positions and fails to place them within the 
specific historical context. Hull, “Camera Work,” 106-151. See also Zilczer, “Aesthetic 
Struggle,” 131-40. 


101. It should be noted that reservations about modem art had been expressed in 
Camera Work before. What I am trying to account for in this section is the revival of 
such arguments at a time when the gallery had identified itself quite closely with the 


most avant-garde tendencies. See for example, Sadakichi Hartmann, “On Originality,” 
Camera Work 37 (January 1912), 19-21.

112. The literature on Weichsel is limited. For an overview of his writings see Hull, 
pues Work,” 140-45. There is a short biographical note in Green, Camera Work, 


113. Victor Meric, “Vers Amorphism,” Camera Work Special Number (June 1913), 
57. The “manifesto” was originally published in Les Hommes du Jour 276 (May 
1913), 8-10. It may have sent to New York by Picabia. See Leavens, ‘291’ to Zurich, 
Ted Ae 

114. Weichsel, “Cosmism,” 70 

Pio aibide. 1 

116. Ibid. 69-70. 


117. Ibid, 82. By “racial” Weichsel appears to have meant “human racial.” There is 
nothing in his essays to suggest that his was another racist theory of art. 


118. Quoted ibid, 72. Buffet, “Modern Art,” 11; Aisen, “Latest Evolution,” 16. 
119. Weichsel, “Cosmism,” 78. 
120. Ibid, 78-79. 


121. I would surmise that Weichsel also asked very little in the way of pecuniary 
compensation for his essays. 


122. John Weichsel to Alfred Stieglitz, 24 August 1913, ASA. Quoted in Leavens, 
‘291’ to Zurich, 77-78. Stieglitz’s enthusiasm for Weichsel's piece is somewhat 
surprising given the poor quality of Weichsel’s prose. 


123. Alfred Stieglitz to John Weichsel, 26 August 1913, John Weichsel Papers, 
Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C. Quoted in 


Leavens, ‘291’ to Zurich, 78.

125. McBride, review of Walkowitz exhibition, 39. 

126. At the same time, of course, de Zayas and other “291”ers were also working for 
Puck magazine. Stieglitz and his associates appear not to have been entirely consistent 
in their promotional efforts, and attempted to appeal to a variety of audiences by a 
variety of means. 


127. This was, of course, “291”’s self-proclaimed mission. 


128. Most notably the Daniel, Bourgeois, and Carroll Galleries. Montross had also 
began showing modem art. See Zilczer, “Aesthetic Struggle,” 245-47.

greater attention. See Lowe, Stieglitz, 181-82, 184, 189-193; Rodgers, “False

166. Man Ray, “Impressions of 291,” Camera Work 47 (July 1914, published 
January, 1915) ,61; Fuguet, “291,” 63. That ’291” was “labour” was another time- 
worn cliche concerning the gallery. See, for example, the portrait of Stieglitz by Marius 
de Zayas entitled “L’Accoucheur d’idées.” Published in Camera Work 39 (July 1912), 
51 [Fig. 14]. Christine Battersby notes that “as the nineteenth century drew on...the 
metaphors of male motherhood became commonplace - as did those of male midwifery. 
The artist conceived, was pregnant, laboured (in sweat and pain), was delivered, and 
(in an uncontrolled ecstasy of agonised - male - control) brought forth.” Christine 
Battersby, Gender and Genius: Towards a Feminist Aesthetics (London: The Women’s 
Press Limited, 1989), 73. She notes this tendency was part of a wider male 
appropriation of desirable “feminine” characteristics.

182. In 1915 Stieglitz even signed personal letters as “291.” See for example, Alfred 
Stieglitz to Agnes Meyer, 23 June 1915, Agnes Meyer Papers, Manuscript Division, 
Library of Congress, Washington, D. C. Hereafter referred to as AMP. 


183. Alfred Stieglitz Archive, Beinecke Library, Yale University, New Haven, Conn. 
Photocopies of some of the documents in the De Zayas Papers, Seville, Spain, make up 
the Marius de Zayas Papers, Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Columbia University, 
New York, New York. I have examined only the photocopies. 


184. The best account of de Zayas’ European trip is in Willard Bohn, Apollinaire and 
the Faceless Man (London: Associated University Press, 1991), 41-47. Bohn does not 
enter into the subject of transatlantic perceptions and misperceptions. See also Willard 
Bohn, “Guillaume Apollinaire and the New York Avant-Garde,” Comparative 
Literature Studies 8, no. 1 (March 1976), 40-51; and Camfield, Picabia, 67-68. 


185. De Zayas’ sojourn can be dated from: Marius de Zayas to Alfred Stieglitz, 22 May 
1914, and de Zayas to Alfred Stieglitz, 13 September 1914. Both ASA. 


186. On June 30, 1914 De Zayas wrote to Stieglitz that he was sending some material 
to Puck, but not “the real stuff, for that does not interest them nor the readers of Puck. 
That I will reserve for us.” Marius de Zayas to Alfred Stieglitz, 30 June 1914, ASA. 
See also: “A Notable Series of Caricatures,” Puck 17 October 1914, 3. 


187. William Camfield believes that de Zayas travelled to Europe with a program of 
exhibitions for “291” already in mind. Camfield, Picabia, 67-70. I think it is more 
probable that de Zayas, while he had some idea of what he wanted, finalised his plans 
as he acquired the works for display. 


188. Agnes Meyer, in a letter to Stieglitz, noted “how much more [de Zayas] is in a 
European setting.” Agnes Meyer to Alfred Stieglitz, 25 June 1914, ASA. In later life de 
Zayas settled in France. 


189. See Guillaume Apollinaire, The Cubist Painters, trans. Lionel Abel (New York: 
George Wittenborn, 1970), 17-18. Originally published in 1913. Virginia Spate, 
Orphism (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979), 71-81. 


190. On Simultanism, see A pollinaire’s own definition in the polemical article 
“Simultanisme-Librettisme.” Les Soirees de Paris (June 1914), 323-25. Also: Gabriel 
Abouin, “Devant l’Idéogramme d’Apollinaire,” Les Soirées de Paris July 1914), 383- 
85. “Simultanaeity,” was, of course, a word widely used to describe artistic and literary 
attempts to embody the totality of a changing experience. See Spate, Orphism, 19-2; 
309-18, Roger Shattuck, The Banquet Years, rev. ed. (London: Jonathan Cape, 1969), 
309-18, 331-52; also Marjorie Perloff, The Futurist Moment: Avant-garde, Avant-

191. “M. de Zayas, who has renewed the art of caricature with extraordinary talent and 
who introduced Picasso and Picabia to America...is presently in Paris. He intends to 
make caricatures of the most advanced individuals in the arts, in literature, and in 
music.” Guillaume Apollinaire, “En Amérique,” Paris-Journal 24 May 1914. Quoted 
and translated in Bohn, Faceless Man, 43.

196. Ibid. The member of the Apollinaire circle with whom de Zayas seems to have had 
the most contact, outside of Apollinaire himself, was the pianist and composer Alberto 
Savinio. Savinio was painter Giorgio di Chirico’s brother.

202. See especially Futurist manifestos that advocated the use of mathematical 
equations in art, or that valorised the methods of science: F. T. Marinetti, “Destruction 
of Syntax - Imagination Without Strings - Words-In-Freedom,” in Futurist Manifestos, 
ed. Umbro Apollonio (London: Thames and Hudson, 1973), 104; Bruno Corradini and 
Emilio Settimelli, “Weights, Measures and Price of Artistic Genius - Futurist 
Manifesto,” in Futurist Manifestos, ed. Umbro Apollonio (London: Thames and 
Hudson, 1973), 135-50. De Zayas, however, was probably not influenced by the 
Futurists in the production of the abstract caricatures. A pollinaire himself had rather 
mixed feeling about the Futurists. His simultanism was influenced by Futunst 
experiments, and he even wrote a poem that incorporated mathematical signs, but in 
general he believed that Futurist work remained too descriptive. See Bohn, Visual _ 
Poetry, 15-17; Guillaume Apollinaire, “Nos amis les Futuristes,” Les Soirees de Paris 
(January 1914), 78-79.

French artists during visits to the United states: Picabia, “How I See New York,” and 
other interviews; “French Artists Spur on an American Art,” New York Tribune, 24 
October 1915, sec. 4, 2.

“Americanism” was more a phenomenon of the 1920s. Andreas Huyssen, “Mass

the term “Simultanism” itself. See A pollinaire, “Simultanisme-Librettisme,” 323-25; 
and Apollinaire, “Nos amis les Futurists,” 78-79. “Impresario” is Roger Shattuck’s 

term for Apollinaire. See Shattuck, Banquet Years, 253-97.

216. “While I was waiting for [July] 25 I nearly accompanied Picabia and Zayas to 
Etival where they were going to prepare the scenery at Picabia’s place. For the 
pantomime was to be performed in New York in January, and I would have been there 
too. We envisioned a great success. The expenses were to be paid by Stieglitz who 
would easily have advanced the necessary sum due to the curiosity our names would 
have aroused in Manhattan on the Hudson.” Guillaume Apollinaire, Souvenirs de la 
Grande Guerre, ed. Pierre Caizergues, (Montpelier: Fata Morgana, 1980), 17. Quoted 
and translated in Bohn, Faceless Man, 54-55. 


217. On the planned Apollinaire exhibition see: Guillaume Apollinaire to Lou de 
Coligny, 21 April 1915, in Guillaume Apollinaire, Lettres 4 Lou (Paris: Gallimard, 
1969). De Zayas and the self-styled American Futurist, Andre Tridon were the backers 
of the proposed concert by Savinio. See Bohn, Faceless Man, 135. An example of 
Savinio’s music was also published in 291, No. 2. 


218. See note 96, above. 

219. Marius de Zayas to Alfred Stieglitz, 30 June 1914, ASA. 

220. Ibid. 

221. Les Soirées de Paris, one of the most important magazines of the Parisian avant- 
garde, suspended publication when Apollinaire joined the army. Kahnweiler’s gallery 


was also shut down by the French authorities because of his German nationality, 
probably to de Zayas’ great satisfaction.

223. Marius de Zayas to Alfred Stieglitz, 13 September 1914, ASA. The bracketed 
question mark at the end of the sentence is de Zayas’, and seems intended to ask 
whether the “civilised” races were, in fact, still civilised now that the war had begun.

up a substantial part of the August 1912 Matisse-Picasso-Stein Special Issue. 


227. The poem by S. S. S. is about a newly married couple. He goes out to work and 
“his work was play,” while “she stayed where she was, to play, - / And her play was 
work, for she was waiting.” Eventually, the woman dies from loneliness and 
boredom. Women’s search for a place in a male dominated world will be an important 
theme of women’s writings in 291 magazine. S. S. S., “And They Met,” 50.

232. The odd man out was Theodore Roosevelt. De Zayas despised Roosevelt because 
he had attacked the art exhibited in the Armory Show and because as president he had 
supported the rule of Mexican dictator Diaz. See Hyland, Conjurer, 112.

239. One of the last pieces in the issue is a prescient essay by Horace Traubel, reprinted 
from The Conservator (July, 1914), in which Traubel declares himself tired of hearing 
the assertion that photographs are not art. During the course of his argument that they 
are art, Traubel elides the distinction between man and machine: “You edge up and ask 
me whether I’m aware that the camera’s a machine. Certainly. And I’m also aware that 
Stieglitz is another machine. And I’m a machine. But Stieglitz is also a man....And 
when I look at these pictures I think that the machine is also somehow a man. And in 
the beauty of what I’m admiring and loving, I can’t tell where the machine in either case 
stops and where the man begins.” The article seem to foreshadow Picabia’s “machine- 
portraits” later published in 291, which similarly mediate between art and non-art.

Chapter Two 


291 Magazine 


291 magazine, published by members of the Stieglitz circle between March 
1915 and March 1916, has been misunderstood in the literature. Frequently, the 
magazine has been regarded as little more than an American effort to produce an avant- 
garde journal based on European models such as Apollinaire’s calligrammes and 
futurist typography.! Others have considered the magazine to be part of the history of 
Dada, or as prefiguring certain aspects of that movement. In this interpretation, 
emphasis is usually placed on Picabia’s “object portraits,” published in 291 Nos. 5/6 
(July/August 1915) to the exclusion of other work that appeared in the magazine.2 291 
is often also discussed with reference to American art and is seen to have influenced the 
development of a uniquely American modemism based on the city and the machine.3 
Although each of these interpretations contains elements of truth, they are incomplete 
and misleading when taken in isolation. These readings usually look at 291 from the 
perspective of a particular artistic movement, such as Dada or “Simultanism,” that has 
points in common with the magazine but is at some distance from it aesthetically and 
intellectually.4 Most of the existing interpretations, moreover, are lacking in detail and 
do not place 291 within a specific historical or geographical situation. While, for 
example, works by the Apollinaire circle, and American art that resembled it, appeared 
in the magazine, this material was published with only a partial understanding of the 


original movement on the part of the editors, and with a different intent. 


Stieglitz’s own account of the magazine’s production and those provided by 
other members of the “291” circle are also not very reliable and usually reflect an 
individual’s personal interpretation of past events. Remarkably little supporting 
material, such as letters and other documents that could help to explain the editors’ 


motives, is in existence, suggesting that editorial decisions were most often discussed

verbally by the “291” group.5 Agnes Meyer who, next to de Zayas, was probably the 
person most responsible for the magazine’s publication, remarked in a letter to Charles 
Freer written on March 4, 1915, that 


a few weeks ago some of the ‘291’ crowd had the idea of getting out a monthly 
leaflet setting forth our view of art, life or any other thing we might care to 
discuss....Of course we get no end of fun out of it and the thing will be worth 
while if only as a self developer.§ 


While Meyer’s note, written before the first number had even appeared, implies that the 
magazine was little more than a trifle, the short article on 291 published in the October 
1916 issue of Camera Work, probably written by de Zayas and Stieglitz, limited itself 
to remarks conceming the magazine’s importance as formal innovation: 


“291” is always experimenting. During 1915-16, amongst other experiments, 
was a Series with typesetting and printing. The experiments were based on 
work which had been done with type and printers’ ink, and paper, by 
Apollinaire in Paris, and by the Futunists in Italy.... The new typography 
already has a name: ‘Psychotype’....7 


Alfred Stieglitz’s account of the “291”’s origins, which appears in “Conversations” 
probably recorded in the 1930s, is the most complete. “De Zayas, Haviland and Agnes 
Meyer,” he recounted, “felt that the war had put a damper on everything.” 


They believed we should publish a monthly dedicated to the most modem art 
and satire. I always had hoped there would be a magazine in the United States 
devoted to true satire, a form of expression sadly ignored here.’ 


The two further said that 291 must get some life into it. Perhaps in this way 


something might happen. I did not quite understand what was meant but my 
understanding was immaterial. The interesting thing was there was a desire to 


be put into action.? 
According to Stieglitz, the objectives of 291 were many, and included the intention of 
revealing “how the game of art and its business was played,” an aspect of the magazine 
later toned down on the advice of Eugene Meyer.!0 Another important aim was to 
provide an outlet for work by artists and writers of the “291” circle, including its 


women members, Agnes Meyer and Katherine Rhoades.!!

While these points are all valid, Stieglitz’s recollections are still probably 
misleading in some respects. Especially hard to credit is his claim that the magazine was 
put together on an entirely ad hoc basis: 


Mrs. Meyer asked how we were to determine what should be published. What 
was our policy to be? Was the majority to rule?...Since we were four, I 
inquired what would happen in case of a tie. Since 291 was being founded on a 
new idea, why think in terms of obsolete methods? If any one of us considered 
something worthy of publication, that should be sufficient reason to incorporate 
it.... Meetings, minutes and endless discussion were anti-291. Agnes Meyer felt 
elated by my approach. !2 


Despite Stieglitz’s disclaimer, there is, in fact, an unmistakable plan to many of the 
issues published, though consistency from one number to the next is aie more 
precarious. Even when the twelve issues of the magazine are looked at as a whole, 
however, some coherent patterns emerge. 291 exhibited a continuing interest in certain 
key areas of concem, including the “business” of art and the art public, the meaning 
and relevance of modem art for contemporary life, and the urban environment in which 
it was often produced. There is, moreover, a distinctive tone to much of the art and 
literature published in 291, one decidedly more aggressive and opinionated than that 
usually taken by Camera Work. A letter written by Marius de Zayas to Agnes Meyer on 
July 15, 1915, after four issues of the magazine had already been published, is perhaps 
more helpful in explaining the editors’ motives. De Zayas wrote that, with 291 
magazine, he, Meyer and Haviland had 


..brought 291...from the beautiful realm of the metaphysical to a field of 
practical action. 291 as a group has taken a very decided personality. We have 
begun to form the inside instead of remaining only a receptive place, which had 


for a business to test the soul of others.13 
De Zayas’ note suggests that the magazine had quite a definite purpose, and that it was 
part of a larger plan that the editors had for “291.” The letter confirms, above all, that 
291 was a further attempt to bring the gallery out of the state of inactivity and 
aimlessness into which it seemed to have fallen in 1914 and that had already been the 
impetus for the “What ‘291’ means to me” issue of Camera Work. I would argue that 


291 should be considered, at least at one level, as yet another effort to provide the

gallery with a more distinct identity and thus involve it more directly in the affairs of the 
New York and intemational art worlds.!4 Most specifically, despite Stieglitz’s assertion 
that 291 aspired to show how the “game of art...was played,” the magazine seems, in 
fact, itself to have been very much a “business” venture initiated with the objective of 
selling “291” to the public. By means of a greater engagement with the practical affairs 
of the art world and by the promotion of the radical art that de Zayas had discovered in 
Europe during the summer of 1914, the editors hoped that they might be able to make 
of “291” a more important centre for modem activity not only in New York but, with 
the decline of the Parisian avant-garde, on an international scale as well. Because the 
magazine involved the gallery more deeply in the business of art, its publication was 
not entirely consistent with Stieglitz’s self-proclaimed anti-commercial beliefs.!5 The 
magazine should probably be seen as something of a rebellion by the younger 
generation at “291,” represented by de Zayas and Meyer, against the authority and 
methods of Stieglitz, a revolt that eventually led to the founding of the Moder Gallery 


as the “commercial” branch of “291” in October of 1915. 


Although 291 was published primarily with the intention of turning “291”’s 
face more to the world, the magazine seems also to have been produced very much for 
the benefit of gallery insiders themselves. As Meyer noted in her letter to Freer, 291, 
especially in its earlier issues, was very much a “self developer” for the individuals 
involved.!6 As such, it had the effect of providing the group and its activities with a 
coherence that allowed members to work with greater confidence for the future. It is 
hardly surprising, therefore, that in the pages of the magazine one frequently 
encounters discussions of “291”’s own identity and that there is even a self-reflexive 
character to contents that, on the surface, are not directly related to the gallery’s affairs. 


The magazine’s ongoing interest in the creative act and in the art public seems most 


particularly to have a bearing on the aspirations of the “291” group itself.17

The first issue of 291, which appeared in March of 1915, was published at a 
time when “291”’s problems, already the object of so much attention on the part of 
gallery insiders, seemed especially persistent. For Stieglitz, the winter of 1914-15 was 
marked by personal differences with some of the “closer associates,” most especially 
Katherine Rhoades, and his days at the gallery were ones of constant tension.!8 The 
continuing war in Europe also weighed heavily on Stieglitz’s mind, and seems to have 
affected his outlook on “291” and art in America. In a letter to Gabrielle Buffet written 
on December 30, 1914, he stated that, despite what Europeans might have heard, there 
was, in fact, no marked American interest in modem art: 


...there is no enthusiasm, there seems to be no life, the people seem not to 
know where they are at, and most of them, men and women, walk about half 
dazed. They seem to have no interest in anything. Of course this is more or 
less a neurasthenic condition. But it is a serious condition nonetheless....Even 
those who could afford it feel ashamed to think of buying pictures, with so 


many people starving in Europe.!9 
He also wondered whether “in times like these I have a right to keep a thing like ‘291’ 


going, or to run a publication like Camera Work.”20 


Stieglitz’s lamentations notwithstanding, there is, in fact, considerable evidence 
to suggest that the market for modem art in New York was not nearly as depressed as 
he made out. In his memoir of this period, admittedly written many years later, de 


Zayas proclaimed 1915 to have been the best year ever for modem art activity in the city 
and described at some length the many exhibitions in which it was shown.2! Lists 


compiled by art historian Judith Zilczer confirm that owners of “commercial” galleries 


in New York continued to be sufficiently optimistic about the art market to stage quite a 
large number of shows featuring modern work.22 Examination of Camera Work 


indicates, moreover, that members of the “291” circle were very much aware of this 


activity, and felt keenly the competition from other galleries. A defensiveness is evident

in the “notes” on this period in the magazine, which found it necessary to point out that 
the works in the Picabia show had “never before been exhibited anywhere and that the 
display of African art at “291” “was the first time in the history of exhibitions, either in 


this country or elsewhere, that Negro statuary was shown solely from the point of view 
of art.”23 The reviews reprinted in Camera Work made, moreover, frequent mention of 
the gallery’s competitors. Most revealing in this regard, perhaps, is a review by Henry 
McBride of the Children’s Art show at “291,” which also included a section on the 
large exhibition of American “cubists” organised by Armory Show alumnus Arthur 
Davies for Montross in March and April of 1915.24 McBride’s comments help to 
clarify the situation in the art world during the early part of that year and to explain 
“291”’s place within it. “Cubism,” it appears, is still causing quite a sensation in the 
city: 


Cubism is in the air. Musicians feel it, poets express it; the dancers reflect it, as 
you will see when the Ballet Russe comes to town; and businessmen make 


considerable money out of it.25 
McBride also noted that 


Mr. Davies’ aggregation of modemists now performing in three of Mr. 
Montross’ rectangular galleries have by no means a monopoly on cubes. There 
are many others in this borough who do it too. Four other galleries in town at 


this moment are given over to the moderns....26 
Apparently, however, 


there is a very evident and widely felt impulse to drape the full responsibility for 
the cubistic movement upon the shoulders of Arthur B. Davies. This is highly 
complimentary to Mr. Davies, but not at all considerate of the feelings of Alfred 


Stieglitz.27 
Most telling, perhaps, is McBride’s observation that 


...Mr. Davies’ crowd have the faculty of arousing more philistine ire than the 
others. This does not prove them better, but it does prove them better 


propagandists for the cause.28 


Comments such as these must have caused considerable distress at “291” in 1915, and 


also suggest that Stieglitz was wrong in his assessment of the New York art market. It

seems likely that it was only “291” and its art, sold by Stieglitz’s methods, that were 
not doing well. Stieglitz’s associate, Marius de Zayas, seems to have read the situation 
somewhat differently. Throughout 1915 he was in ongoing contact with artists and 
dealers in Europe and, by the summer of that year, was convinced that a “commercial” 


branch of “291” would be able to support itself. 


Exhibitions at “291” during the first half of the 1914-15 season were made up 
of the work that de Zayas had brought back from France in September, and were 
probably put together largely under his direction. These exhibitions, as has already 
been noted, were the most serious and demanding presented by “291” since the spring 
of 1913 and appear to have been organised partly in the hope of reestablishing the 
gallery’s reputation as the leading centre of modern activity in New York.29 
Appropriately, de Zayas’ exhibits placed the work on display into the context of the 
theory of art that he had recently set out in essays for Camera Work. They were thus 
the result of a considerable amount of research and reflection, and constituted a 
monument to the modern movement that was hard to ignore. Moreover, while the work 
exhibited was difficult, the educational format also had the effect of rendering it 
somewhat less forbidding to people unfamiliar with modern art. The first of these 
shows, on view between November 3 and 27, 1914, was made up of African 
sculpture, and thus illustrated the sources of moder “form” in the art of “primitive” 
peoples. The “291” galleries were specially decorated for the occasion by Eduard 
Steichen in black and orange patterns.30 The second exhibition, on the walls from 
December 9, 1914 through January 11, 1915, showed the recent work by Picasso and 
Braque that de Zayas had obtained from Picabia. This was the art of the modem 
masters of the investigative art of form, created on the bases of the African model.31 
The third and last of the exhibitions organised by de Zayas comprised the four large 
canvases that Picabia had completed in 1914 and which seem to have been intended by

Udnie”]32 These bold and aggressive works by the artist who, in his investigations, 
had cut the remaining ties with subject matter, represented the very latest tendency in 
modern painting.33 A note on these exhibitions from the October 1916 Camera Work 
suggests that they held considerable importance for “291” insiders and were viewed as 
something of an abstract of the gallery’s “discoveries” to date. The Picabia exhibition 
had, the reader was informed, 


brought to a close the definite series of experiments begun at ‘291’ some years 
ago. And the underlying idea of this series was summed up in the exhibitions of 
Negro Art, Picasso-Braque, closing with Picabia.34 


These exhibitions can also be regarded as constituting yet another reply on the part of 
de Zayas to John Weichsel and the other aesthetic conservatives at “291.” They 
implied, by means of their historical programme, that abstraction was not an aberration, 


but the logically necessary outcome of the history of art. 


Whatever the merits of these shows, they seem, unfortunately, to have been 
taken by critics as just another set of additions to the many exhibitions of modem art 
already on view in New York City, and did not succeed in their appointed task of 
increasing “291”’s prestige in the art world. Some reviewers were duly shocked by the 
art displayed, a reaction that, in so far as it contributed to the gallery’s notoriety, was 
certainly not unwelcome. E. G. Forbes Watson of the New York Evening Post, for 
example, found the African art show to be a veritable heart of darkness on Fifth 
Avenue, “so powerfully expressive of gross brutality that the flesh quails.”35 Elizabeth 


Luther Carey wrote in the New York Times that the Picabia exhibition, “logically 
following that of Picasso last month,” was made up of “most unpleasant arrangements 
of strangely sinister abstract forms that convey the sense of evil without direct 
statement.”36 On the whole, however, reviews of the 1914-15 season at “291,” which 
were duly reprinted in Camera Work, make for rather dull reading. Many critics were 


appreciative of “291”’s efforts, and dutifully passed on information from de Zayas and

Stieglitz, or provided their own, rather pedestrian, interpretations of the art shown.37 
Few of their reviews, however, communicated a sense of excitement, or indicated that 
something “new” had been said. The unspoken consensus seems to have been that 


“291,” despite its best efforts, had failed to stand out from the crowd. 


Following the Picabia exhibition, eclecticism retumed to “291.” Realist-oriented 
work by Katherine Rhoades and Marion Beckett was exhibited in February, to be 
followed by a large John Marin retrospective and a show of children’s art, the third 
such event at the gallery. By the spring of 1915, however, Marius de Zayas, Agnes 
Meyer and Paul Haviland were hard at work on 291 magazine, a project that, in many 
respects, took up where de Zayas’ three exhibitions had left off. 291, in common with 
these shows, published and publicised absolutely the latest in art from Europe, most 
notably the “Simultanism” of the Apollinaire circle. Apollinaire had, in fact, recently 
argued that Simultanism was superseding and incorporating abstraction in the efforts to 
convey modern consciousness, and 291 magazine could thus be seen as taking the 
gallery a step further in the historical series that the exhibitions had begun.38 The first 
issue of the magazine, which appeared late in March, had very much the air of a 
manifesto, and indicated, by means of statement and example, the directions in which 
the editors intended to take 291 and “291.” Much of the material published was, in fact, 
self-referential in the manner of the “Means to Me” instalment of Camera Work, but in 
this case its purpose was to show that introspection and self-doubt were a thing of the 
past at “291” and that in future the gallery would be more aggressive in its dealings 
with the outside world. De Zayas’ cover illustration, a cubified caricature of Stieglitz 


accompanied by the inscription, “291 throws back its forelock,” set the new, more 


brazen, tone [Fig. 17].39 


291 No. 1 opened with a long essay on art criticism by Agnes Meyer that, in its 


assertive tone, formed a contrast to the more restrained writing characteristic of Camera

Work.40 Entitled “How Versus Why,” the essay was a heated condemnation of the 


criticism Meyer abhorred, and a forthright explanation of that which she admired. 
Meyer was not afraid to name names in her article, and signalled out James Huneker, a 
New York critic quite in sympathy with modem tendencies, to bear the brunt of her 
attack on what she called “emotional” criticism.4! Writing such as Huneker’s, which, 


she argued, dealt more with the critic’s own personality than with the art under 
consideration, was rejected in favour of commentary that followed the “scientific” lead 
set by modem art itself: 


ART HAS ALWAYS PROGRESSED AS THOUGHT HAS 
PROGRESSED the most revolutionary changes having taken place within the 
last fifty years as a natural pace-keeping with the tremendous development of 
thought. But American criticism has again demonstrated that our best brains are 
devoted to production and not to pure thought for criticism in its methods has 
lagged lamentably behind the product it presumes to estimate. The scientific 
influence has at last invaded the field of art but its critics still wander blissfully 


in the land of romance.42 
The criticism Meyer endorsed was one that would eschew subjective considerations and 
quests for “the unknowable,” to emulate science in its practical and hard-headed 
approach.43 Criticism, she maintained, should examine art from two main points of 
view: 


Under the first aspect we must determine what the artist wishes to express and 
how adequately he succeeds in that expression; under the second aspect we 
must decide upon the value of that expression as an addition to what has already 


been said.44 
Meyer claimed that “291” had, in fact, been engaged in just this kind of activity for 
years: 


‘291’ realizing that conditions were changing and that the element of reason was 
assuming as important, if not more important a role than the emotional element, 
has resolutely devoted its energy to explaining the ‘HOW’ of art, content to let 
the romanticists continue their vague struggle as long as the battle with 
windmills and the EXPLANATION OF THEIR OWN PERSONALITIES 


might amuse them.45 


In preparation of the article, Meyer seems to have been greatly influenced by de Zayas’

theories of art, or may have expressed opinions that the group held in common. De 
Zayas’ concems that art be relevant, that it deal with the facts (“form”) in a “scientific” 
manner, and that it not dabble in idle speculation (”metaphysics”) were here applied to 


art criticism.46 


Although the opinions expressed in “How Versus Why” were probably 
sincerely held, and were consistent with aspects of de Zayas’ aesthetic theory, the true 
intent of Meyer’s article is, however, hard to determine. Despite the cogency of the 
arguments presented and the vehemence of the language used, examples of criticism 
that followed Meyer’s prescriptions did not, in fact, appear in subsequent issues of 
291, although “scientific” looking art was there in abundance. Meyer’s assertion that 
“291” had been engaged in this kind of critical activity all along was, moreover, plainly 
preposterous. Although Stieglitz claimed that the gallery was a place where 
“investigations” were conducted, he seldom limited himself only to observations about 
what an artist had or had not accomplished and, moreover, explicitly advocated a 
“personal” response to the art on view. Stieglitz’s magazine, Camera Work, was also 
replete with just the kind of “emotional” responses to art that Meyer deplored. In light 
of these contradictions, I would suggest that “How Versus Why” is best read, not 
literally, but as a more general statement of intent addressed to “291”’s audience. The 
article’s pragmatic approach to the specific issue of art criticism suggested, more 
broadly that, in future, the gallery would not let itself be sidetracked by mere personal 
whims or vague spiritual urges, but would “stick to the business at hand” and aim to 


“accomplish well defined tasks.”47 The repudiation of an emotional response to art also 


had the effect of distancing the editors of 291 from Stieglitz and Camera Work, and 
thus from the lassitude that seemed to infect the gallery in 1914, Finally, through its 
rejection of most current criticism, “How Versus Why” indicated that, henceforth, 


“291” would, by means of the new magazine, maintain a relationship with its audience 


that circumvented intermediaries interested only in themselves.*

“How Versus Why” can be paired in 291 No. 1 with an imaginary 
conversation, written by Paul Haviland, between the “Spirit of 291” and a “Professor,” 


that deals more directly with the issues of aim and identity only hinted at by Agnes 
Meyer.4? In Haviland’s piece, the Professor interrogates “291,” “a place, a person, and 


a symbol,” as to what “definite thing” this “291” is. The Professor, in common with 
Meyer, stands opposed to all vagueness in thought and language. In reply to “291”’s 
assertion that it “represents nothing definite,” but is “ever growing, constantly changing 
and developing,” the Prof. maintains: 


But somebody should know; somebody should know what it should 
accomplish. If ‘291’ is nothing definite but only a spirit, how can it do its 
work? We know now what the spirit of ‘291’ is, as nearly as a spirit can be 
known. What we should know for the future is ‘291’ the machine which will 
provide the channels through which this wonderful spirit can accomplish useful 


work,50 


The conversation ends in a compromise between the Professor’s literal-mindedness and 
“291”’s reluctance to be pinned down. “Let us not quarrel about words,” the Professor 
declares. 


You have been fighting against FIXED laws which impede progress and 
development. The laws I mean are but our conception of the relationship of 
phenomena which we use as guides in making discoveries. That, I believe is 
what you have always sought to discover. If ‘291’ sees clearly the path which 
is traced for it, great things may be expected from it for its preliminary work has 


been well done.5! 
Although the conversation ends on a conciliatory note, most of the piece is, in fact, a 
quite severe indictment of Stieglitz’s unwillingness to define “291”’s purpose more 
clearly, and a reprimand to the gallery for its recent bout of acedia. The Professor’s 
critical voice is the one heard most often in the conversation, and his arguments, unlike 
“291”’s vague and circular replies, are logical and articulate. As if to draw attention to 
the connection between the present discussion and “291”’s unfortunate predicament, 
Haviland even makes several references to the “What ‘291’ means to me” issue of 


Camera Work, a volume that had addressed, in its own fashion, some of these same

problems. The gallery’s eclecticism and receptivity, for which contributors to that issue 
had had nothing but praise, seems, in fact, to be one and the same with the lack of 
definition that now so concerns the Professor. Significantly, the Prof. even goes so far 
as to quote Eduard Steichen’s remark that recently “291” had only been “marking 
time.”>2 The point that the conversation as a whole seems intended to convey to the 
reader is that, despite the faults outlined by the Professor, “291” would change its ways 
and make the desired leap forward into clarity of vision. Haviland’s conversation thus 
had the effect of creating, in the manner of “How Versus Why,” a distance between the 
old, inward-looking “291” and the pragmatic and enterprising gallery that the younger 
generation wanted to set up in its place. Here, as in Meyer’s essay, however, the details 


themselves were still rather vague. 


Examination of the remaining contents of 291 No. 1 helps make the meaning of 
Haviland’s “definite thing” somewhat more clear. Other items published commented in 
an unambiguous voice on art activities in New York, or vociferously advocated the art 
of the Apollinaire circle in France, thus providing readers with an accurate idea of the 
magazine’s stance. An activism on the part of the editors of 291 was most in evidence 
on the page, to become a regular feature in the magazine, devoted to short articles on 
artistic affairs. In contrast to Camera Work, which limited itself mainly to observations 
on broad tendencies in art or on the activities of the Stieglitz circle, and which rarely 
made direct accusations, the short article page expressed sharp and unequivocal 
opinions on a number of very specific issues. A renewed awareness of the world 
outside “291”’s doors is communicated by articles published in the first issue, which 
provided information not only on exhibitions at “291,” but also on those taking place at 
a variety of “commercial” venues, including a display of drawings by Pascin at the 
Berlin Photographic Galleries, an “Arts and Crafts” show at the Arden Gallery, and 


even the large Matisse exhibition at the Montross.53 In almost every instance, however, 


the editors of 291 took it upon themselves to draw an object lesson from these events

for the benefit of the public, usually in the form of a comparison of the exhibition under 
consideration with activities at “291” or with the art of the Apollinaire circle. The article 
on Matisse at the Montross, for example, seems little more than a pretext to pass on a 
witticism concerning philistine reaction to exhibits of the artist’s work at “291”: 


Stieglitz has had two exhibitions of Matisse’s work and he also says ‘The 
Masses laughed.’ And he adds that Masses =M asses = 1000 asses.54 


In similar fashion, the little article on “Simultanism” drew attention to both the the Arts 
and Crafts show at the Arden and to Apollinaire’s “simultaneous representation,” the 
current object of fascination at “291.”55 The article on “Sincerism,” part of which 
concemed the painting of Max Weber, then on view at the Print Gallery, provided an 
Opportunity to disseminate information on Albert Savinio’s musical theories, of which 


“291” was then in sole possession.56 


Articles appearing in 291 magazine, like those published by Camera Work, 
frequently reveal an ambivalent attitude on the part of the editors toward the public at 
large. Although, on the one hand, 291 seems intended to promote the “291” gallery, 
and to draw a larger audience to its activities, on the other hand, the magazine often 
took public tastes and affectations to task in the manner of John Weichsel. On the short 
article page, two publics were, in fact, distinguished. The first, the mass public, which 
tended to laugh at modem art, was put firmly in its place by articles such as that on 
Matisse at the Montross, and by another, entitled “Idiotism,” that reprinted a fatuous 
review of an exhibition by John Marin.57 The second public, the one which approached 
modem art with an open mind, was treated much more kindly. The articles on Matisse 
and “Idiotism” were, in fact, probably published not only in order to dismiss the first, 
philistine public but also to inform members of the second, more sympathetic audience 
that they were not “asses,” but part of the select crowd that actually got the point. While 
this strategy of inclusion and exclusion is familiar from Camera Work, what is new 


here is a reinvigorated faith, on the part of “291,” in the wrongheadedness of philistine

opinion, and in the ability of at least a portion of the public to appreciate modem art 
without the benefit of “debates” as to its meaning. The audience for modern art does, 
however, come in for some rebuke. In an article on the exhibition by Rhoades and 
Beckett at “291,” entitled “Unilaterals,” readers were informed that 


the public of ‘291’ has been accustomed to receive and never to give. It has 
taken it for granted that we owed it all our efforts to present to New York the 
principal tentatives of modern art for its own amusement, merely as a 

form of social function. 


No, the efforts of ‘291’ in placing its public in contact with the principal 
achievements of modem art has not had as its objective to amuse, but to further 


the progress of both artist and community through a commerce of ideas.58 


Although “Unilaterals,” like articles by John Weichsel, was critical of the public’s 
tendency to mistake the viewing of art for a social occasion, this kind of criticism also 
contained an element of flattery. By means of a restatement of the old “291” doctrine 
that the public had an important role to play in the creation of art, the editors of 291 
suggested to their audience that, at present, it was the artistic avant-garde that was 


dependent on the public for future success, and that it should therefore make efforts to 


live up to its responsibilities.59 


Although a variety of art was presented by 291 No. 1, that which was most 
wholeheartedly endorsed by the magazine was “Simultanism,” Guillaume Apollinaire’s 
latest enthusiasm. The very first of the short articles, which took its title from the new 
movement, provided a short definition of the form based, in part, on Apollinaire’s 


essay, “Simultanisme-Librettisme,” published by Les Soirées de Paris the previous 
summer.© Interestingly, the definition that appeared in 291 placed greater store in 


painterly and auditory, rather than more literary, examples: 


The idea of Simultanism is expressed in painting by the simultaneous 
representation of the different figures of a form seen from different points of 
view as Picasso and Braque did some time ago; or by the simultaneous 
representation of the figure of several forms as the futurists are doing. 


In literature the idea is expressed by the polyphony of different voices 
which say different things. Of course, printing is not an adequate medium, for

succession in this medium is unavoidable and a phonograph is more suitable.6! 


As an artistic illustration of Simultanism an etching by Picasso, from the artist’s 
analytical period, was reproduced above, thus linking the new art with work for which 
“291” was better known [Fig. 18].62 A little poem, entitled “At the Arden Gallery, 599 
Fifth Avenue,” made up of lines of conversation to be “uttered simultaneously,” was 


provided below as an auditory/literary example. 


Although printed forms of Simultanism were faulted by the article, “Voyage,” a 
calligramme (“ideogramme”) by Apollinaire, was given pride of place on the centre 
page of the issue, and seems intended as the most important illustration [Fig. 19].63 
Originally published in the same issue of Les Soirées de Paris that also reproduced de 
Zayas’ abstract caricatures, “Voyage” was a representative example of Apollinaire’s 
latest version of the form. In it, he combined words and lines of poetry to form images, 
including a train, a cloud, and a starry sky, evocative of travel by night, and even 
incorporated a little picture of a telegraph pole with insulators and wires that looks as if 
it might have been taken from a catalogue or magazine. The combination of such 
diverse elements was intended to produce a more complete experience of the poem’s 
theme in the reader/viewer than that which was possible by means of a single medium, 
an experience that supposedly deepened as the poem-image was deciphered. Like the 
little poem on the Arden gallery, “Voyage” was radically decentred, and allowed the 
locus of meaning to exist partly outside the artist, in the transient fragments of 
information that made up the work. Although this kind of dispersal of meaning was an 
element of Apollinaire’s poetics, it is interesting that the article on Simultanism 
published in 291 made a point of stressing its “objective” aspect: 


That the idea of simultanism is essentially naturalistic is obvious; that the 
polyphony of interwoven sounds and meanings has a decided effect upon our 
ear is unquestionable, and that we can get at the spirit of things through this 


system is demonstrable.65

This interpretation of Simultanism has many points in common with de Zayas’s theory 
of art, most especially with his conviction that modem art should have an investigative 
intent, and it is therefore likely that the definition originated with him. De Zayas, in 
fact, appears here to be taking some tentative steps toward the formulation of his own 
version of Simultanism, related to, but distinct from, Parisian examples. It is probably 
no coincidence that in his definition he seems to take into account some of the more 
practical exigencies that modem art and “291” faced in New York City. His insistence 
on Simultanism’s investigative purpose had the effect of making this strange new art 
more understandable, and thus more attractive, for practical-minded Americans, and 
also helped to bring this rather nebulous and suggestive art into some conformity with 
the editors’ efforts to make “291”’s approach to art and life appear more businesslike 


and down-to-earth. 


De Zayas’ definition of “Simultanism” suggests that 291 magazine was 
directed, in the first instance, at a New York audience. While this was certainly the 
case, the situation was, I believe, somewhat more complicated than is first apparent. 
Much of the material published in the magazine was, of course, intended as very direct 
advertisement for “291” in an American market. “Oil and Vinegar Castor,” the etching 
by Picasso reproduced on the short articles page, was probably one of the works by the 
artist exhibited at the gallery during the 1914-15 season, or is very like one that was. 
Similarly, the “Unilaterals” article, in part a review of the Rhoades-Beckett show at 
“291,” served to draw attention to artists who were very closely associated with the 
gallery.67 Even “Voyage,” the “ideogramme” by Apollinaire reproduced inside, 
however, may have had a directly promotional purpose. Literary historian Willard 
Bohn has drawn attention to a letter written by Apollinaire to Louise de Coligny, dated 
April 21, 1915, that mentions an offer the poet had received to exhibit his calligrammes

New York,” he wrote, “Si ga se fait, ce sera épatant.”69 Bohn even suggests that the 
visually-oriented calligrammes later published as “Case d’armons” were created by 
Apollinaire with this American show in mind.70 It seems likely, then, that “Voyage” 
and the other “Simultanist” contents of 291 No. 1, functioned as advance publicity for 
this exhibition which, unfortunately, was never held. Much of the material in the 
magazine dealing with “291” seems, however, to have been directed at yet another 
audience as well, one made up of the very European avant-gardists who were published 
in it. From its inception, copies of 291 were sent to Apollinaire and Picasso in France, 
and subsequent issues were received by many prominent Europeans, including Ezra 
Pound, Adolph Basler, and even Tristan Tzara in Zurich.7! Beginning with the July- 
August 1915 double issue (Nos. 5/6), essays published by the magazine were printed 
in both French and English, probably with the intention of making them more 
accessible to this other audience. European mailings and translations into French 
suggest that the contents of 291 were partly determined by a desire on the part of the 
editors to satisfy this European constituency. Most specifically, they seem intended to 
make the “291” gallery better known in Europe and to prove its avant-garde credentials 
in countries where the modern movement had originated. Publication of Apollinaire’s 
“Voyage” and other more radical work in the first issue, then, demonstrated to 
Europeans that American galleries, and the American public, were sufficiently 
sophisticated in artistic matters to warrant their attention, and that New York might be a 
good place to publish and exhibit. Judging from Apollinaire’s response to the offer of a 
show at “291,” de Zayas and his associates were not wrong in their assessment of the 
possible European reaction. Subsequently, 291 published a considerable amount of 


Parisian material, much of which seems similarly directed at two audiences. 


291 No. 1 was also the first issue of the magazine to publish material that made 
use of sexual and gendered imagery. While at this point I do not want to discuss this 


sexualised discourse at any length, because very similar imagery was used by later

contributors to the magazine in some of the same contexts, a few points should be made 
about certain works that appeared in No. 1. A note on the short articles page concerning 
the exhibition of Pascin’s mildly erotic drawings at the Print Gallery, entitled “Satirism 
and Satyrism,” is of considerable interest in that it indicates by its title that the “true 


record of New York life” advocated would, in fact, be a sexual one.72 The article thus 


suggested that the relationship between the modem artist and the modern city could be 
thought of in sexual terms, and that such a conception might facilitate the creation of a 
more honest art. “At the Arden Gallery,” the “Simultanist” poem that appeared on the 
same page, which was made up entirely of the idle chatter of women at an art 
exhibition, seems, in some respects, to complement the article on Pascin.73 Through its 


explicit focus on an audience of women, the article began, in a more general way, to 
“feminise” the audience for art, and implied that a relation with it, on the part of male 
artists and critics, might also be imaged in sexual terms.74 Another noteworthy 
characteristic of the first issue is the implication, in several works published, that 
women, and relations with them, are a vitally important part of the male artist’s creative 
life, and that separation from them could lead to artistic impotence. Apollinaire’s 
calligramme, “Voyage,” for example, is, in part, about the poet’s recent separation 
from his companion, Marie Laurencin, an event that seems to have caused him 
considerable distress.75 In the poem, Apollinaire expresses longing for his beloved by 


means of modem, technological images, including a sentence in the shape of a train: 


Ou va donc ce train qui meurt au loin 
dans les vals et les beaux bois frais du 


tendre été si pale? 76

The premise that women, both real and figurative, are of great importance to the 
male artist as companions and muses was even more in evidence in “One Hour’s Sleep 
---- Three Dreams,” the prose composition by Alfred Stieglitz that appeared 
immediately below Apollinaire’s “ideogramme.”78 Although the work does not submit 
to precise interpretation, its obsessive concem with death and resurrection suggests that 
the “dreams” probably had much to do with Stieglitz’s fears for his own and “291”’s 
future. In the first dream, Stieglitz found himself dead and about to be buried. But then: 
“A door opened and a woman came in. As the woman came in I stood up; my eyes 
opened.” The woman asked, “Friend are you really dead,” but Stieglitz could not 
answer. “As she asked the third time I returned to my original position and was ready 
to be buried.” In the second dream, a woman holds out a similar promise of recovery, 
one which proves equally illusory. “I was very ill and everyone asked me to take a 
rest,” Stieglitz recounted. “No one succeeded to induce me. Finally a Woman said: ‘I 
will go with you. Will you go?’” As they journeyed on, however, the woman grew 
tired, and cried out, “Food - Food - I must have food.” Stieglitz answered: “Food - 
Food -, Child, we are in world where there is no Food - just Spirit - Will.” Eventually, 
Stieglitz kissed the woman and “all sorts of wonderful food” appeared.79 She remained 
behind to eat while Stieglitz journeyed “onward” in his spiritual quest. The third dream, 
in which Stieglitz was murdered by a woman in case of mistaken identity, is the most 
obscure: 


The Woman and I were alone in a room. She told me a Love Story. I knew it 
was her own. I understood why she could not love me. And as the Woman told 
the story - she suddenly became mad - she kissed me in her ravings.... 


‘Tell me you are He - tell me - you are He. And if you are not He I will kill you. 
For I kissed you’....I said, ‘I am not He.’ And as I said that the Woman took a 


knife from the folds of her dress and rushed at me. She struck the heart.80 


All three of these “dreams” are evidence of a strong need, on Stieglitz’s part, for 


women, both real and metaphoric, as a source of inspiration and strength, and of his

predilection for imaging a wide variety of concems in terms of a relationship with them. 
The dreams also speak of a deep ambivalence towards this source of spiritual 
sustenance, for even as Stieglitz finds in women the prospect of renewal, he fears that 
their feminine nature will render them fallible and treacherous. Stieglitz himself thus 
becomes a tragic figure, divided and flawed.8! In work that later appeared in 291 
magazine, similar metaphors of sexual promise and deceit were applied by both men 
and women artists and writers in a number of otherwise unrelated contexts. Images of 
sexual union and successful birth were used to suggest various kinds of completion and 
fulfilment, while impotence and betrayal imaged failure and loss. Most specifically, 
these sexual polarities were mapped across the relations that de Zayas and other 
contributors to 291 imagined themselves to have with the city and the audience for art, 


both of which, as I have pointed out, were already sexualised in this first issue. 
The Early Issues 


The public response to 291 No. 1, like that to all issues of the magazine, is, 
unfortunately, quite hard to gauge. Stieglitz and his associates did not keep subscription 
lists and, while 291 was mentioned in personal letters, it received relatively little 
attention in newspapers and other printed documents. One cannot, therefore, accurately 
determine either how widely the magazine was read, or by whom. In conversation with 
Dorothy Norman in the 1930s, Stieglitz remarked that there had been about one 
hundred subscribers to the regular edition and eight to the special, but that, apart from 
these subscriptions, not a single copy of the magazine had been sold.82 Low sales, 
however, do not necessarily indicate that 291 was not read in artistic and literary circles 
in New York and elsewhere. Many copies were given away to friends and other 
interested parties, and many more were mailed free of charge to Europe, where, as we 


have seen, the magazine attracted some attention.83 291 seems also to have been quite

widely circulated among American artists and writers of advanced tendencies and 
among radicals and artistic hangers-on in Greenwich Village. Later, copies were also 
passed around at the international salon hosted by Walter Arensberg at 33 West 67th 
Street. 291, moreover, seems to have had an extensive circulation after it had ceased 
publication, both in the United States and abroad. An article by Amy Lowell on 


Apollinaire’s calligrammes, which she had first seen in 291 No. 1, was not published 


in The New Republic until March 4, 1916, a full year after that issue had appeared.84 


291 magazine, whatever its effect on the world at large, seems to have had a 
considerable impact on the Stieglitz circle itself, and on persons close to it, not all of 
whom approved of the new publication’s aggressive stance or its preoccupation with 
strange European movements. Charles Caffin, the art critic for the New York World 
and, in the past, a frequent contributor to Camera Work, for example, wrote to Stieglitz 
on April 6, 1915, to express his concern about the direction that “291” was pursuing: 


I used the word ‘disillusionment’ solely in reference to the change that 
seems to me to have come over the spirit of ‘291,’ the old spirit of mutual 
helpfulness. 

During the past winter I have felt, rightly or wrongly, that a new spirit, 
one of bitterness, was creeping in. Now comes the magazine which has taken 


the old name, but seems to be projected as an organ of antagonism.85 


Caffin took particular exception to Agnes Meyer’s article, “How Versus Why,” which 
he seems to have regarded as a personal attack on his own style of criticism, even 
though he had not been personally mentioned. John Weichsel, whose articles critical of 
modern art had recently appeared in Camera Work, declared, in a letter to Stieglitz 
written in 1917, that he had also been “disillusioned” by “291” two years before: 


It may seem strange to you, but ‘291’ did not seem as being your place - fora 
thousand and one reasons - and in coming there, at first, somewhat frequently, 
and, later on, more and more seldom, I was conscious of invading the 
premises, in art and writing and decorum, of De Zayas, Haviland, Kerfoot, 
Dodge, and Meyer etc. - a complex of oracles that ever seemed to me hovering 


over the place....86 


In 1915 Weichsel cut most of his ties with the gallery to start his own arts organisation,

the “People’s Art Guild.” That these changes at “291” were more than superficial is 
suggested by a letter that Stieglitz himself wrote to Marie Rapp on June 3, 1917, in 
which he signalled out Agnes Meyer and 291 as being the cause of ill-feeling between 
Caffin and him: 


Keiley gone - and Caffin gone [Caffin died in 1917] - Nothing ever came 
between my friendship with them. Agnes Meyer came near doing inevitable 
mischief - when she wrote that article in 291 - No 1 on Criticism - between 
Caffin and me - Fortunately in that instance she could do only temporary 
mischief....A foolish woman - Her day will come.87 


Although the letter was probably written with more recent bad memories also in mind, 


it suggests that some distrust between Stieglitz and his closer associates existed as early 


as the spring of 1915, and that it had been caused by 291.88 


Heated responses to 291 No. 1, although they must have been somewhat 
disturbing, cannot have been completely unwelcome either, for they showed that the 
magazine and its editors had had at least some demonstrable impact on people who 
mattered. In a letter to Charles Freer, Agnes Meyer showed herself actually to be quite 
pleased with Caffin’s response to “How Versus Why”: 


You will be amused to know that my article has won for me Caffin’s deepest 
hatred, so much that he runs away when he sees me coming. He told Stieglitz 
that 291 was getting ‘pugnacious’ and that the old spirit - of ‘helpfulness’ (for 
Caffin you see) was dead. In other words as long as we bolstered him up we 
were fine and now that one of us tells him he is a fossil, we are all “dead’.... 


May I never belong in spirit to the past generation.89 


This little controversy suggests that the first issue of 291 magazine did have the desired 
effect of creating a new, more assertive personality for the gallery, at least within a 
limited circle of individuals. Outraged responses and the resultant changes in “291” 


personnel, moreover, also had the effect of consolidating Meyer, de Zayas, and 


Haviland even more thoroughly as the “inside” at the gallery.% 


In this section of my thesis I want to look closely at the next three issues of 291

magazine, which appeared in April, May, and June of 1915 (Nos. 2-4), and which 
have certain features in common. Although my survey will be quite broad, I intend to 
concentrate on certain key issues, most especially on the question of how the editors 
pursued their aim, sketched out in No. 1, to make of “291” a more “definite thing.” I 
want, in particular, to look at the ways in which the publication of 291 constituted an 
act of promotion for the gallery, and thus involved members of the Stieglitz circle more 
deeply in the business of art. If, in these issues, the gallery was made something more 
“definite” through the expression of clear-cut opinions, and by the promotion of certain 
avant-garde art and ideas, the magazine seems also to have been intended to bring a 
greater specificity to “291” by means of an appeal to a more sophisticated, high-society 
audience that might possibly be interested in buying art. Needless to say, publication of 
the magazine was, therefore, not entirely consistent with Stieglitz’s claim that “291” 


constituted a commercial-free space. 


Although, as I shall argue, the editors of 291 made use of a variety of quite 
subtle techniques in their efforts to publicise the gallery, much of the material that 
appeared in these earlier issues was also quite forthright in its desire to draw attention to 
“291” and its affairs. Most of the works published had a direct connection with 
activities at the gallery, and the editors seldom included work from outside the Stieglitz 
group or the Apollinaire circle. Works by Marius de Zayas, Agnes Meyer and 
Katherine Rhoades occupied an especially prominent place in the magazine, as did the 
art of painters affiliated with the gallery. The covers of Nos. 3 and 4, for example, 
were by the well known Stieglitz circle artists, John Marin and Abraham Walkowitz, 
both of whom had recently been exhibited there. Both these covers presented the name 
of the gallery in bold and contemporary contexts, thus associating it once more with the 
avant-garde art that was again “291”’s specialty. That of No.4 reproduced one of 


Marin’s views of Fifth Avenue, the busy street on which “291” itself was located, 


drawn in the artist’s most modern cubo-futurist style[Fig. 26].9! Walkowitz’s cover for

the third issue showed the numbers “291” afloat at the centre of an abstract maelstrom 
of ink, not overwhelmed, but seemingly at home there [Fig. 23].92 Publication of work 
by members of the Apollinaire circle seems similarly intended, in part, to publicise the 
“291” gallery. Although work by Apollinaire himself did not appear again, his name 
was mentioned several times in these issues, often with regard to that same urban 
environment featured on the covers, and the composer Albert Savinio, another 
important member of the Apollinaire circle, was also the subject of much attention.93 
An autograph score of Savinio’s song, “Bellovees Fatales No. 12,” was reproduced in 
the second issue, while his manifesto on music appeared in No.4.% As has already 
been noted, the fact that Apollinaire was to have been exhibited at “291” and Savinio to 
have given a concert in New York helps to explain the attention paid to these men in the 


magazine.95 


Less obvious means used in 291 magazine to publicise the “291” gallery did not 
involve references to particular artists and exhibitions, but had more to do with the type 
of material published and the methods by which it was presented. That the look of the 
magazine was notably eye-catching itself probably bore some relation to such a 
promotional purpose. Where the first issue had published several long pieces of prose 
that contained involved discussions of art, in subsequent numbers brevity was the norm 
in prose pieces and the overall focus shifted noticeably to the visual elements. It is, in 
fact, probably not a coincidence that 291 came to resemble some of the advertisements 
towards which Apollinaire had directed the attention of artists, and that the same 
visually-oriented style, with short snippets of prose, also characterised the appearance 
of such widely-circulated magazines as Puck and Vanity Fair.% [Figs. 27, 28] In 291, 
this graphic style was taken to such lengths that whole pages were frequently devoted 
to one image, within which effective use was made of striking juxtapositions. On the 


inside double page of No. 3, for example, which combined poems by Meyer and

Rhoades with an abstract drawing by de Zayas, the type is oriented in different 
directions, and a deep black covers half the page to create a powerful overall effect.97 
[Fig. 24] Beginning with issue four, the page devoted to short articles was dropped 
from the magazine, a change that allowed the editors to aim for an even greater visual 
impact. This tendency in 291 culminated in the double issue, Nos. 5/6, which was 
given over entirely to Picabia’s machine-drawings (and an essay on them by de Zayas) 
[Figs. 33-37].98 These five portraits of the “insiders” at “291” in the form of machines 
could hardly have been a more effective vehicle for the brash, contemporary image that 


“291” was trying to present. 


The most conspicuous characteristic of 291 magazine, however, was the 
combination into one work of elements from different media, most especially the union 
of words and images that had been heralded in No. 1. Examples of the “visual poem,” 
based on Apollinairian and Futurist models, and made up of words arranged into 
shapes or a combination of words and graphic material, appeared in almost every 
subsequent issue. The presence of such work in the magazine can, as has already been 
noted, be partly explained by the fact that “Simultanism” was something unique to 
“291” and thus served to distinguish the gallery from other players in a crowded field. 
Beginning with No. 2, however, the editors were not content only to publish European 
examples of the form, but were ready to try their hands at Simultanism for themselves. 
“Mental Reactions,” a collaboration between Agnes Meyer (words) and Marius de 
Zayas (image) in No. 2 was the first such work that appeared [Fig. 21], to be followed 
by J. B. Kerfoot’s “A Bunch of Keys” in No. 3 [Fig. 25], and de Zayas’ portrait, 
“Femme!,” in No. 9 [Fig. 43].99 In these works, the definition of Simultanism that de 
Zayas had provided in the first issue, which stressed the naturalistic and investigative 
potential of the form, was, consciously or unconsciously, put into practice. In keeping 
with de Zayas’ positivist aspirations, most American “visual poetry” published by 291 


was noticeably less anarchic than European examples, and aimed to provide a clear-cut

description of the subject under consideration. In Kerfoot’s “A Bunch of Keys” and the 
(much later) “Femme!” by de Zayas, for example, although the different parts of the 
poem were dispersed on the page in the manner of Apollinaire’s calligrammes, there 
remained little question of how these parts related to one another, and a single quite 
unambiguous meaning thus emerged.!0 Interestingly, most American examples of 
“visual poetry,” including the three works already mentioned, were also portraits of 
distinct individuals.101 Appropriation of the techniques of Simultanism allowed 
authors to present the different aspects of a person’s character side by side, without the 
presence of distracting connecting material. In “Mental Reactions,” for example, which 
recorded a woman’s thoughts during a flirtation at a party, Meyer and de Zayas were 
able, by means of the simultaneous presentation of ideas, to suggest an anxious state of 
self-division: 

How can he bear to speak of it if it was real to him?

Despite its striking appearance, however, “Mental Reactions” remains essentially

introspective, rather than “objective,” means. Although the interplay of words and

images creates a certain amount of difficulty for the reader, it soon becomes clear that 


lines and words are set out in two distinct columns which can be quite easily 
understood when read from top left to bottom right.!03 The presence of such traditional 
elements serves to differentiate the poem from certain European examples where a 
dispersal of meaning among the transient objects of the artist’s perceptual 
consciousness is more in evidence (see Apollinaire, “Lettre-Océan” for comparison 
[Fig. 22]).104 Whatever difficulties are presented by “Mental Reactions” are more the 
result of the psychological complexity of the characters portrayed than of the poets’ 


attempt to communicate a perceptual and conceptual state of mind.105 


The presence in 291 of this “American” adaptation of Simultanism had the 
effect of toning down some of the radicalism of the magazine while leaving it visually 
and emotionally interesting. This tendency seems to reflect a desire, on the part of the 
editors, to make of this strange new art something more “definite,” and therefore more 
acceptable to skeptical-minded Americans. Such a practical disposition on the part of 
291 was probably also related to the decidedly urbane and worldly quality possessed by 
these and other works published, a characteristic of the magazine that makes up another 
of its more conspicuous features. Both these elements seem intended to make 291 
attractive for those more sophisticated, if yet still somewhat provincial, middle and 
upper class members of the audience for art who might be expected to form its 
readership. The distinctive tone possessed by 291 is particularly noticeable when it is 
compared with Camera Work. Where the older periodical offered its readers Weichsel’s 
earnest social-aesthetic moralising, or de Zayas’ rather tedious theoretical articles, 291 
published a considerable number of lighter, more amusing items that were addressed to 
readers’ lively, if rather superficial, interest in the entertaining things of the modern 
world. Short articles in Nos. 2 and 3, for example, commented on such subjects as the 
New York Flower Show, the premiere of Scriabin’s “Prometheus” Symphony at 


Camegie Hall, a performance by a company of Irish players in Greenwich Village, and

even such controversial matters as illegitimacy and suicide. 106 


The “American” visual poems already discussed inhabit a similarly lively and 
cosmopolitan, if rather bourgeois, environment. Although J. B. Kerfoot based the 
radiating circular form of “A Bunch of Keys” [Fig. 25] on Apollinaire’s calligramme, 
“Lettre-Océan” [Fig. 22], he seems unaware of the French poet’s ambition to image the 
profound changes in consciousness created by modem communication. Instead, 
Kerfoot offered the reader a charming and quite comprehensible portrait of an 
individual in a confining upper middle-class existence, aspects of which were 


represented by the “keys” on the chain:

A rather facile piece of social satire, “A Bunch of Keys” would have been quite at home 
in one of the more popular New York magazines to which, as we have seen, members 
of the “291” circle also contributed.!08 Even the more complex, “avant-garde” works 
published in the earlier issues of 291 reflect this same leisured upper and middle class 
milieu. “Mental Reactions,” for example, records, as has already been noted, a modem 
woman’s thoughts during a flirtation at a fashionable party [Fig. 21].!09 The setting for 
the encounter is an apartment far above the New York streets, and it is obviously a 
luxurious one, for De Zayas and Meyer even provide examples of the perfume and 


chocolate box labels (“PARFUMERIE DE NICE,” “CremeS”) that surround the 


protagonists.!10 Much of the poem is made up of hair-splitting introspective analysis of

motives, feelings, and reactions of others to the self, that serves to identify the woman, 
and to a lesser extent her companion, as intelligent, sophisticated and thoroughly 
modem. Such a portrayal of sensitive people in a very contemporary situation would, I 
believe, have appealed to readers with pretensions to the same degree of urbanity. The 
poem effectively connected modern art and literature with a very specific setting, one 


where art and social environment seemed to complement one another. 


I do not want to give the impression, however, that all the work published in 
these issues of 291 was bland and superficial. Much of this material, even as it seems 
intended to cater to a specific audience, was intellectually quite astute and commented in 
a clear and perceptive voice on a variety of issues. The tone of notices on the short 
article pages, for example, remained more candid and critical than that of similar articles 
in Camera Work, and “truthtelling” about the art world was much in evidence. As it had 
done in the first issue, 291 continued to draw the attention of the public, and public 
institutions, to their civic responsibilities. The New York Academy of Design, for 
example, was told that it did not, in fact, need larger premises, just good art to put on 
its walls ("The Academy,” No. 2).!1! United States tariff laws were found to be a 
disgrace in that they restricted the free import of European art ("Do Not Do Unto 
Others,” No. 2), while the valuation of work on the basis of its origin in a famous 
collection was deemed to be equally reprehensible (” Values in Art,” No. 2).112 By 
means of the short articles page, then, the editors of 291 maintained “291”’’s reputation 
as an honest voice in art. The custodian of high standards, the magazine challenged the 


art world to do better. 


Short articles published in the second and third issues, unlike those appearing in 
No. 1, also dealt with a number of subjects seemingly unrelated to art as such. Thus, 
beginning with No. 2, 291 magazine presumed to arbitrate not only on artistic affairs, 


but on musical matters as well. While the “new music” of Albert Savinio had already

articles not only on Savinio, but also on American composer-pianist Leo Omstein, and 
on Alexander Scriabin’s “Prometheus” Symphony.!13 The score of Savinio’s 
“Bellovees Fatales No. 12” (Fatal Bellowings No. 12”) also appeared in No. 2, and 
his manifesto on music, “Dammi l’anatema, cosa lasciva” (“Strike Me with Anathema, 
Lascivious Thing”), which condemned most contemporary music for its sentimentality, 
was reprinted in No. 4.114 Although, as has been noted, this material was intended 
primarily to draw attention to Savinio, its inclusion may also have had a more ambitious 
purpose as well. Performances of spectacular orchestral works by such composers as 
Scriabin, Strauss, and Schoenberg had the ability to draw in much larger crowds than 
most exhibitions of contemporary art.!!5 Identification of “291” with music may, 
therefore, have been partly intended to capture for the gallery some of music’s greater 
prestige and to bring a portion of its audience into the “291” fold.!16 While material on 
music made up a considerable portion of the contents of the short articles page, 
beginning with the second issue commentary was extended to cover to an even broader 
range of interests. Among the articles, for example, were no fewer than two on the 
subject of illegitimate births, and the grief that the social stigma attached to illegitimacy 
could cause.!17 The more substantial of these, entitled “Motherhood a Crime” (No. 2), 
quoted a newspaper report about the case of a New Haven woman who took her own 
life rather than bear her child and then asked: 


Should not this dramatically condensed report of the tragedy of a girl’s life 
receive more than passing attention? We go to see Brieux’s Matemity at the 
theatre. We applaud and adjourn to the the dansant. When it comes to the test 


what do we do?118 
There is a decided social conscience at work in this article that is new to “291” and that 
served to associate the magazine with the women’s movement and with the more 
general tendency, then taking place, towards greater social and sexual freedom, an 


aspect of 291 that will be discussed in more detail below.

In the short articles we also leam more about the editors’ opinion of the 
American public, a subject that had, of course, been of great interest to the gallery for 
some time. As in the past, two “publics” were distinguished, each of which was dealt 
with in an appropriate manner. The mass public, which, as has already been noted, had 
been severely dismissed by articles in the first issue, was again faulted in No. 2 for 
tolerating disasters at air shows as the price of entertainment. After providing details of 
two such gruesome incidents, 291 commented: 


The American public is very indignant at the loss of innocent lives on 
the battlefields of Europe. 

Bull fights are prohibited on U. S. territory. Our kind hearts rebel at the 
idea of cruelty to animals. 


But the Public must be amused.!19 


This article, like many of the others published, has an arch, superior tone to it that 
easily distanced “291” from these kinds of events and the people who enjoyed them. 
The article also demonstrates just how remote the 291 group was from participation in 
popular conceptions of the modem and its marvels, despite the celebration of a more 
urbane modernity elsewhere in the magazine. In contrast, the Futurists, members of an 


avant-garde movement to which 291 owed a great deal, would have applauded this kind 


of behaviour as heroic.120 


Another familiar tactic, the playing up of European art and ideas at the expense 
of American work, also made a frequent appearance in the short articles. This device 
was used by the editors, as it had been in the first issue, to distinguish “291,” the centre 
of a genuine modemism, from the facsimiles available elsewhere. Thus, Leo Omstein, 
the American composer-pianist, was compared unfavourably with Savinio, his 
counterpart in the Apollinaire group. Ornstein’s compositions, the reader was 
informed, 


are toy imitations. Although they are intricate in their structure, the spirit has the 
naive charm of a child imitating what strikes his attention.12!

In other articles, most notably the one entitled “Watch Their Steps,” published in No. 
3, the European perspective was also used to create a distance between “291” and the 
wider American culture. The author of “Watch Their Steps,” for example, found that 
women’s shoes were a sort of unconscious modem art “trying to get into the feet” of 


Americans.1!22 


For the first time the spirit of modern art has been genuinely manifested 
in this country. 

Women’s shoes reveal a new mentality at work. 

They break away from convention. They give the pleasure of the 
unexpected. 

They are the expression of a love of disharmony. 

They have no rhythm. 

They have no balance. 


They synthesize the abstract.123 


While these comments were very generous, the article also identified such recognition 
of the unexpected in the ordinary as a uniquely Apollinairian project: 


Apollinaire that profound observer of the superficial brought to artistic 
significance the squeaking of the ‘new shoes of the poet.’ Unhappily we have 
no poet in New York who could sing of the forms that women are wearing 


now. 124 


With this reference to Apollinaire, the article began to suggest that, while appreciation 
of this kind of mass cultural phenomenon was acceptable, it must, if the American 
observer was not to be corrupted, be carried out through the intermediary of a poet with 
good Parisian credentials. “291”’s European alliances seem to have conditionally 


allowed it to be that “New York poet,” and watch American culture from a safe 


distance. 125 


I suspect that here we start to get at something quite important for the editors of 
291. On the short articles page, and in the magazine as a whole, the editors exhibited 
both a fascination with the variety, excitement and vitality of modem life, and an 
equally strong need to keep an intellectual distance from this object of fascination. This 


double attitude, which was not unusual among modem artists and critics of all

nationalities, seems, however, to have been especially characteristic of the “291” 
group, and probably reflects the precariousness of the foothold that its members 
believed they had gained in American society.!26 This interest in and simultaneous 
distrust of popular culture was also closely connected, I suspect, with the similar 
ambivalence that the editors of 291 held towards the American art audience. This 
audience, of course, was not the same as the mass public, but it shared some of the 
same tastes, and seemed to exhibit the same inability to distinguish true from false. It 
was, moreover, as the Armory Show had demonstrated, also a force that could have a 


great deal of influence on art in the United States. 


The most interesting article on the subject of the art public in the earlier issues of 
291 is one in No. 2, entitled “Economic Laws and Art,” that purported to explain the 
significance of the “American Modems” show which had been on view at the Montross 
Gallery between March 23 and April 24, 1915.!27 This was the same exhibition that 


had given critic Henry McBride the occasion to note, in the review already discussed, 


that the organiser of the show, Arthur B. Davies, had proved himself “a better 
propagandist” for Cubism than others in New York.128 Although a number of artists 


respected by the Stieglitz circle were represented in the exhibition, the majority of the 
art shown was of a kind that marked the Montross Gallery out as a purveyor of “sham 
cubism” to a gullible public.129 Despite its tawdriness in the eyes of “291,” however, 
the exhibition was well attended, and for this reason seems to have merited comment in 
291. The editors led off their article with an assessment of the exhibition’s importance 


for New York: 


There are many things in the Montross Show of American Moderns 
which tempt the critic to lay about him and slay unmercifully, but as a unit the 
exhibition is unquestionably interesting and significant. The mere fact that such 
an exhibition can take place on Fifth Avenue where rents must be paid, is an 
important indication of the change in public attitude, and the added fact that the 
gallery was usually crowded at twenty-five cents per head, shows that the 


interest is not spotty but widespread.130

Such solid observation, however, soon gave way to snide speculation as readers were 
asked to consider the question: ““Who took the lead, the artists or the public?” The 
article elaborated: 


In other words is American cubism, or futurism, so sincere an expression that 
the speedy conversion of the public to its serious consideration was inevitable, 
or did the public interest, aroused by 291 and the big Armory Exhibition of 
French Moderns, create a demand which our men are trying to supply?!3! 


The writers of the article found that both influences had been present, “thus leaving to 
the buying public an interesting opportunity of furthering modem thought by weeding 
out the true from the false....” Prospects for art were, however, not very bright because 
the event also offered 


to those who have reached a conclusion as to the critical faculties of the public, 
an opportunity of prophesying some of the future developments of art in 


America.!32 


The conclusion readers were meant to draw from this carefully-worded sarcasm was 
that the public had been so thoroughly corrupted that it was incapable of judging 
correctly, and was thus unable to contribute anything worthwhile to art in America. The 
Montross Gallery, moreover, was only a link in a vicious circle. Its recent promotion of 


a false art had served to debase the public taste, a development that would in future lead 


to a further deterioration in art.133 


Superficially, “Economic Laws and Art” seems completely pessimistic in its 
opinion of the art public, not far removed in its contempt from that expressed by John 
Weichsel in his articles for Camera Work. Beneath the scorn, however, the authors of 
the article seemed to recognise, with a certain awe, that the magnitude of the response 
to the exhibition at the Montross itself gave the event a real importance ("The mere fact 
that such an exhibition can take place on Fifth Avenue where rents must be paid....”). 
Moreover, the article also displayed a marked fascination with a process that would 
allow the public to influence “the furthering of modern thought by weeding out the true 


from the false.” Although intended as a piece of satire, “Economic Laws and Art”

seems, therefore, also to acknowledge frankly the importance of the public for the well- 
being of art in the United States, and to admit that a meaningful advance was not 
possible without its participation. I suspect that the exhibition at the Montross was so 
fascinating for the editors of 291 because it was an event that had succeeded in the same 
public arena where, by means of the magazine, they themselves were now attempting to 
operate. Although the exhibition was not one that they would have liked to organise, 
the editors betrayed an awareness that a similar success at “291” would necessarily 
involve the same level of participation on the part of the art public, and a consequent 
acknowledgement by gallery insiders that the public had a significant role to play. 
Conclusions such as these must have been difficult to face, however, and it is hardly 
surprising that “Economic Laws and Art” attempted to maintain distinctions between a 
corrupt public and one that possibly had something to contribute, and between honest 


players in the marketplace (”291”) and more suspect participants (Montross, etc.). 


A double attitude on the part of 291 toward the American public seems also to 
be closely connected with a similar ambivalence toward business, in art and elsewhere. 
The very last short article to appear in the magazine, entitled “Ave Caesar Imperator!!! 
Morituri te Salutant!,” treated the “AMERICAN BUSINESS MAN?” in the same heavily 
ironic manner to which the public had been subjected in “Economic Laws and Art.”134 
The article began by presuming to praise the businessman for his fortitude in the face of 
“yellow journalists of all shades that have constantly hounded him....” In spite of such 
opposition, 291 found that the businessman had 


gone on working, meeting all hindrances and difficulties, lastly turning into the 
country’s greatest good the present cataclysm that might have so easily been its 


ruin, 135 
The insinuation here was, I believe, that American businessmen had now tumed war- 
profiteers and were benefiting from the suffering of others. The article went on to pose 
yet another set of rhetorical questions and to provide an answer for them: 


If we wish to find the greatest imaginative powers of our country, do we think 
of our artists? The question is almost ludicrous when we compare the realised

imaginations of the artistic and the business world. Where is our most effective, 
our most adventurous thought? Who creates and guides and supports our 
universities, our charitable and artistic and scientific endeavours of every sort? 
In short who is the only man without whom we could not get along, politicians, 
social workers, and college professors notwithstanding?...The answer to all 
these questions is too obvious. Our social structure may be a machine that is 


clumsy, inefficient, antiquated, but verily it hath its god.136 


It is very hard to know what to make of these final sentences. On the surface, they 
seem intended as a further ironic indictment of the importance American society placed 
on business and its culture. But most of these statements could also be taken as the 
honest truth. The “realised imaginations of the artistic and the business world” were 
indeed very different, and tended to fall mainly on the side of business. Businessmen 
did, moreover, to some extent support the arts, universities, and so on. The article 
takes on an even stranger aspect when one recalls that the “291” gallery itself existed 
largely at the pleasure of business people. Paul Haviland, scion of a porcelain fortune, 
had, in the past, paid the rent, while Eugene Meyer, husband to Agnes and an up-and- 
coming banker, made frequent contributions and purchases. Stieglitz himself had some 
money of his own which he put into the gallery, but he and his family were supported 
largely by income from his wife’s share in the brewery managed by her brothers. If 
“Morituri te Salutant!...” was meant as sarcasm, then the opinions expressed were 
blatantly in conflict with some of the gallery’s own practices, and it is hard not to read 


the piece as an example of singularly bad faith on 291’s part. 


Would it be going too far to find a sort of self-deconstructing discourse here? a 
moment when irony loses its balance and one can no longer tell parody from the real 
thing? At the very least, this article seems to inhabit a place where 291 was not quite 
sure of its bearings, or of its allegiance. Although the indignation expressed, both here 
and in the article on the Montross exhibition, was probably honestly felt, it also seems 
touched with a great deal of envy and resentment (Why is the piece entitled "They who 
are about to die, salute thee?”), that suggests the editors were not entirely happy with 


“291s own practices. The articles are evidence that their loyalties were alternating

between “291” and the promise held out by a wider contact with the public, and 


between Stieglitz’s idealism and the methods of the business world. 


The Machine Portraits 


An interest on the part of the editors of 291 with the public and with business 
reached its high point in an essay by Marius de Zayas that appeared in the summer 1915 
double issue, Nos. 5/6. (The article does not have a title, but begins, “New York, at 
first, did not see...”)!37 The subject of this essay was the importance for American art 
of the “object portraits,” or machine drawings, by Francis Picabia that made up most of 
the issue [Figs. 33-37]!38 De Zayas’ essay, which I plan to discuss at some length in 
this section of my thesis, concerned itself with some of the same issues of the public 
and business that had recently been the subject of such short articles as “Economic 
Laws and Art,” and “Ave Caesar Imperator!!! Morituri te Salutant!” While the essay is 
open to several interpretations, I intend to argue here that it says as much about de 
Zayas’ own preoccupations and about the direction in which he was taking “291,” as it 
does about either the object portraits or modem art in America. Picabia’s new art 
seems, in fact, to have helped de Zayas to establish a rapprochement with the business 


ethic toward which the short articles had shown such ambivalence. 


Francis Picabia, who had last been in the United States at the time of the 
Armory Show, returned to New York in June of 1915, ostensibly en route to Cuba on 
a mission for the French government but, in actual fact, on the run from the war in 
Europe. Picabia was welcomed back to “291” with enthusiasm and quickly made 
himself at home in New York City, where he remained until early in 1916.139 Picabia 
was soon intimately involved with the day-to-day production of 291 magazine, and his 


works were soon published in its pages.!40 The first of these to appear, a drawing

entitled “Fille nee sans mere,” the “Daughter bom without a mother,” reproduced in the 
June 1915 issue (No. 4), marked the beginning of the artist’s “mechanomorphic” 
period [Fig. 32].!41 In this unusual work, Picabia combined organic forms reminiscent 
of breasts and tendons with such mechanical elements as springs and levers to create a 
work that hardly looked much like art at all. The drawing’s precursors included Futurist 
art and ideas and recent works by Picabia’s friend Marcel Duchamp (the “Bride” 
pictures, “Chocolate Grinder’’) but it had also been anticipated by Picabia’s own 
abstract paintings of 1914 ("Je revois en souvenir ma chére Udnie,” etc., recently 
exhibited at “291” [Fig. 16]) which contained similar rounded, lunging forms. The 
import of the drawing, and its title, was that machines and works of art should both be 
considered as “Filles nées sans mere,” autonomous creations brought forth entire by the 
mind of man.!42 The appearance of such a strange work in the pages of 291 probably 
reflected the greater importance that de Zayas and Picabia had assumed in the editorship 
of the publication and constituted a challenge to readers to follow the magazine into 


places where they had not yet been asked to go. 


The “Fille née sans mere,” however, was only a taste of what was to come. 
During Picabia’s stay in New York, the surface appearance of his art underwent a 
complete change as the artist discarded the abstract forms he had been using for several 
years and replaced them with a vocabulary of machine parts and epigrammatic sayings 
that he wrote directly onto the canvas.!43 The July-August double issue of 291 
reproduced the first major works in this new style, five “portraits” of Stieglitz, de 
Zayas, Meyer, Haviland, and Picabia himself, in the form of machines.!44 Visually, 
these works, which had more the appearance of diagrams than art, were at an even 
farther remove from Picabia’s abstract style than the “Fille née sans mere.” Almost 
every detail in them was based on illustrations that the artist had found in American 


magazines and catalogues and could be identified as part of an actual machine [Fig.

38].!45 Although the machine drawings were unusual when looked at from the point of 
view of art, their strangeness was somewhat deceptive, for with some knowledge of 
Picabia’s purpose they were quite readily understandable, and could be seen to have 
points in common with his abstract work as well. On one level, Picabia was, in fact, 
attempting to provide quite straightforward portraits of persons with whom he was 
acquainted, using a symbolism that represented traits of an individual’s character by 
means of an appropriate machine part. Thus, Stieglitz, a photographer, was depicted as 
a camera [Fig. 33], but one that had broken itself reaching for the “IDEAL.” The gear 
shift in neutral position at the right of the portrait was probably included as a reference 
to his current state of inactivity and indecision and was thus part of the internal critique 
of Stieglitz already underway.!46 Haviland, who was about to return to France to help 
manage the family porcelain firm, was portrayed as a portable lamp with the comment, 


Ze ee 
“La poesie est comme lui” [Fig. 37].147 


Picabia’s most complete statement on the machine drawings, and the machine 
paintings that followed, is contained in an article entitled “French Artists Spur on 


American Art,” published in the New York Tribune on October 24, 1915.148 This 


article, which also included material from interviews with Marcel Duchamp, Jean 
Crotti, Albert and Juliette Gleizes, as well as Marius de Zayas, attempted to 
demonstrate the impact that the New World was supposed to have had on recent French 
artist-emigrés to the United States. The artists interviewed all expressed great 
enthusiasm for their new home, none more so than Picabia, who ascribed the invention 
of his new artistic style entirely to the influence of the mechanised American 
environment. “I have been profoundly impressed by the vast mechanical development 
in America,” he told the interviewer. 


The machine has become more than a mere adjunct of life. It is really a part of 
human life - perhaps the very soul. In seeking forms through which to interpret 
ideas or by which to expose human characteristics I have come at length upon 
the form which appears most brilliantly plastic and fraught with symbolism. I 
have enlisted the machinery of the modem world, and introduced it into my

Underlying Picabia’s enthusiasm for machinery was the conviction, also expressed by 
the other artists interviewed that, since the outbreak of war, the United States had 
become a place more congenial for the production of art than Europe. “In America work 
of an artistic nature is possible,” Picabia maintained, “where it is utterly impossible in 
Europe to-day. The war has killed the art of the Continent utterly.”150 What is most 
remarkable about Picabia’s statement, however, is the magnitude of the artistic 
conversion he attributed to the effect of his coming to New York, and the extent to 
which he was willing to give himself over to his new environment: 


Prior to leaving Europe I was engrossed in presenting psychological 
studies through the mediumship of forms which I created. Immediately upon 
coming to America it flashed on me that the genius of the moder world is 
machinery, and that through machinery art ought to find a most vivid 


expression.!51 


Picabia seemed to imply here that he, an introverted European, had needed the jarring 
experience of brash and outgoing New York to bring him out of himself and take a look 


at the world around him. Such sentiments, perhaps, were not surprising, given his 


recent experience of events in Europe.152 


Picabia’s machine drawings were, in fact, not quite as radical a departure from 
the artist’s former methods as he maintained in the interview, the same theory of 
correspondence between inner being and outer reality that had provided the intellectual 
rationale for his abstract style also serving as the foundation for the mechanical work. 
Where, in his abstract paintings, Picabia had used pure forms to denote ideas or 
emotions aroused in him by an exterior event, in the machine drawings he replaced 
these with mechanical elements used in precisely the same manner. In both styles, 
“reality” was transformed by the mind of the artist to create work thought to be a more 


lucid and accurate portrayal of affairs.!53 There is also evidence, from the drawings 


themselves, that Picabia had not, in fact, been as completely won over by life in the

United States as he claimed, for most of the machine portraits contain satirical elements 
that seem to mock, in a gentle manner, certain uniquely “American” traits possessed by 
the individuals portrayed. Beautiful young Agnes Meyer, for example, depicted as a 
high-quality sparkplug, was shown to be the American super-flirt, giving off sparks 
and promising “FOR-EVER” but, in fact, hard and unapproachable [Fig. 35].154 As a 
group, moreover, the machine portraits implied that the insiders at “291,” and 
Americans generally, were partly under the control of the mechanical environment 
around them and had thus given up a part of their humanity. In so far as Picabia 
suggested that Americans were not, in fact, masters of their own fate, his new work 


constituted a pointed critique of American culture. 


Almost as interesting as Picabia’s machine-portraits themselves is the 
accompanying essay by Marius de Zayas, “New York, at first, did not see...,” which 
extolled the French artist’s new works as examples of authentic American art.!55 The 
essay’s shrill and abusive tone stands at some distance from the more reasoned style of 
de Zayas’ theoretical writings, and was probably intended to draw outraged attention to 
itself and Picabia. De Zayas began his essay with an analysis of the current condition of 
American art, a fact that itself comes as something of a surprise. Although de Zayas, 
and the other members of the Stieglitz circle, had often expressed concer for the 
fortunes of art in America, art’s uniquely American characteristics had seldom 
warranted extended comment in the group’s publications. (The “American” form of 
Simultanism I distinguished in previous issues seems not to have been thought of as 
such.) Despite his former lack of interest, however, in “New York, at first, did not 
see...” de Zayas found it necessary to deplore the fact that a uniquely American form of 
modem art did not yet exist. Disregarding his own strong European allegiances, he 
informed the magazine’s readers that it was precisely the accumulated weight of foreign 


borrowings that had discouraged its development: 


All genuine American activities are entirely in accord with the spirit of modem 
art. But American intellectuality is a protective covering which prevents all

conception. This intellectuality is borrowed, exotic. Better still it is a paste 
diamond. !56 


American “intellectuals” were, in fact, found to be American art’s greatest enemy: 


Beware, messieurs the Americans of your intellectuals. They are 
dangerous counterfeits. They believe themselves to have a luminous mission; 
but their light dazzles the eyes instead of illuminating.... 


The real American life is still unexpressed. 
America remains to be discovered. 157 


De Zayas then went on to fault even the work of Alfred Stieglitz in an unprecedented 
public attack that served, in a striking manner, to distance de Zayas, and 291, from his 
old mentor. Although de Zayas had considerable praise for Stieglitz’s efforts on behalf 
of photography, he found that in his role as exhibitor of modem art he had acted as yet 
another “cold-blooded” intellectual: 


Stieglitz wanted to work this miracle. 
He wanted to discover America. Also, he wanted Americans to discover 
themselves. But in pursuing his object, he employed the shield of psychology 


and metaphysics. He has failed.158 


De Zayas attributed this failure to Stieglitz’s attempts “to work through suggestion,” a 
method that had, in his opinion, proved too timid to have much effect in the United 
States. Blame for the backwardness of American art was not his alone, however. After 
Stieglitz had shown examples of modern work in New York, its mannerisms were 
taken up and corrupted by others: 


But soon commercialism brought an avalanche of paintings. Those lepers, 
those scullery maids of art, those Sudras of progress - the copyists, got busy. 
They even believed themselves to be part of the evolution because, instead of 


copying trees, they copied a method. 159 


Taken as is, this blanket condemnation of art activity in the United States would seem 
to apply to work produced by artists of the Stieglitz circle, as well as to that shown by 


the “commercial” galleries, but de Zayas’ comments were probably directed mainly at 


the latter. 160

What was apparently needed if a true American art was to come into being was 
some sort of naked encounter with the objective environment as it existed in the United 
States. “America remains to be discovered,” de Zayas declared. “And to do it there is 
but one way: ---- DISCOVER IT!”!61 Details of the process by which this discovery 


might be made were not provided, and it seems likely that they were not very clear even 
to de Zayas himself. The American artist’s task, he wrote, was to express the country’s 
“potentiality” in art and thus teach America how “to amuse itself.” De Zayas’ lengthy 
analysis of the artistic situation in the United States led up to an appraisal of Francis 
Picabia’s new art which, he found, was the product of just such an unabashed 
encounter with the objective: 


Of all those who have come to conquer America, Picabia is the only one who 
has done as did Cortez. He has burned his ship behind him. He does not protect 
himself with any shield. He has married America like a man who is not afraid of 


the consequences. He has obtained results. 162 


Picabia was thus enlisted as a sort of honorary American who, by virtue of his 


unclouded modern mind, was able to see what was actually before his eyes. 


Although de Zayas’ celebration of Picabia as an authentic American artist is 
strange, there were some quite good reasons behind his enthusiasm for the man and his 
new work, reasons that had much to do with the circumstances that de Zayas and “291” 
found themselves in at the time. On the most basic level, the essay was yet another 
effort to publicise the gallery in New York, at a time when it faced stiff competition 
from other venues. Picabia, a well known European artist associated with the most 
recent tendencies in modem art, was someone with whom the members of “291,” just 
then exhibiting a renewed interest in the avant-garde, would very much have wanted to 
be connected. By proclaiming Picabia the artist of the American scene, moreover, de 
Zayas could also counter the claims of galleries such as the Montross to be the centres 
of American modernism. Picabia’s presence in New York and his production of 


“American” work therefore gave American art back to “291.” De Zayas’ enthusiasm for

the machine drawings was probably also influenced by their similarity to work that had 
already appeared in 291 magazine. Although he chose to ignore the satirical element in 
the drawings, their brand of slightly racy humour was comparable in spirit to work that 
had already been published, notably J. B. Kerfoot’s “A Bunch of Keys.”!63 In so far 
as the machine portraits used the ordinary stuff of the modern world to create highly 
personal combinations, they were also an example of the Simultanism that had already 
been so prominently featured in 291. Their rather technical appearance, moreover, 
linked them with pronouncements on “scientific” art and criticism made in “How 
Versus Why,” and with the practical uses for Simultanism that de Zayas had outlined in 
his article on the subject for No. 1. At the very end of “New York, at first, did not 
see...”, de Zayas even made this connection explicit when he suggested that Picabia 
had used his new art as an investigative tool: 


He has obtained results. And he has brought these to ‘291’ which accepts 
them as experience, and publishes them with the conviction that they have the 


positive value which all striving towards objective truth possesses. 164 


Like much of the Simultanism already published in 291, moreover, Picabia’s drawings 
possessed features that would possibly allow them to be appreciated by a wider public. 
Superficially “realistic” in style, they also contained clues to their interpretation that 
could render them quite understandable, at least to the initiated. This apparent 
accessibility may, I suspect, have further encouraged de Zayas in his belief that the 


machine drawings might form the seed for a new American art.165 


While these considerations were probably all factors in de Zayas’ ecstatic 
reception of the machine drawings, some other less obvious motives were, I suspect, 
also present. The depth of de Zayas’ enthusiasm for Picabia’s new work was 
astonishing and by its very intensity gives rise to a certain amount of incredulity. How 
can work by a wealthy Spanish-French expatriate really be American art? Why was 
American art suddenly so important when it had not been before? And why was an art

based on advertising, of all things, suddenly acceptable at “291”? It is, of course, very 
likely that de Zayas’ essay was written very much under the influence of Picabia’s own 
enthusiasm for the United States and that he was expressing opinions the two men held 
in common. It is also possible that the essay was a reflection of the general increase in 
the level of American nationalism that took place after the outbreak of World War I. 
Nationalism, in art and elsewhere, was, however, not yet very much in evidence by 
mid-1915 and de Zayas’ own enthusiasm for American art was, moreover, remarkably 
short lived.166 The following two issues of 291 (Nos. 7/8 and No. 9) presented 
American work of a sort (by Stieglitz, de Zayas and Picabia) but in the winter of 1915- 
16 the magazine was publishing more European material than ever before.!67 There is 
also, however, a real possibility that “New York, at first, did not see...” was written 
not only for the benefit of the American public but with 291’s considerable European 
audience also in mind. By the summer of 1915, de Zayas and his associates appear to 
have succeeded in their aim of demonstrating to Parisian artists and writers that New 
York offered considerable exhibition and publication opportunities. American 
credentials, however, were still far from assured and de Zayas may have seen in the 
machine portraits a further opportunity to promote “America” and “New York” to 
Parisians in a manner that they would have understood. “Picabia has gone native!” de 
Zayas’ essay seemed to say.” “Machines are the new source of modem art! The United 
States is the world’s new art centre!” It was perhaps with a Parisian audience in mind 
that the essay was printed first in French, in large letters, followed by an English 


translation below. Some sixty copies of Nos. 5/6 were, in fact, mailed to Paris in 


August of 1915.168 


I suspect, however, that there was still another important reason for de Zayas’ 
fascination with Picabia’s art. To give some idea of what this reason was I will have to 
look closely at that material in “New York, at first, did not see...” which deals with 


those sensitive issues of the public and business in art that had already so engaged the

editors of 291. Significantly, perhaps, de Zayas led off his essay with a feminine 
personification of the New York public, an entity which, as soon becomes clear, is a 
part of the formula that could make true artistic creation possible in the United States: 


New York at first did not see. Afterward she did not want to see. Like a 
circumspect young girl or a careful married woman, she has taken all possible 
precautions against assimilating the spirit of modem art; rejecting a seed that 
would have found a most fertile soil. 169 


This public must, however, be stimulated if it is to accept the discoveries of modern art, 
a task that “American intellectuals” have not been able to accomplish: 


They wish to impregnate you, believing themselves stallions when they are but 
geldings. They are not a product of their country. Their ideal does not reach 


beyond their personal interests.!70 


The reason that Stieglitz has also failed in his endeavours is that he has not been 
forceful enough in his dealings with the public: 


He has put the American art public to the test. He has fought to change good 
taste into common sense. But he has not succeeded in putting in motion the 
enormous mass of this public’s self sufficiency. America has not the slightest 
conception of the value of the work accomplished by Stieglitz.171 


Although de Zayas, in passages such as these, still showed himself to be of two minds 
in his opinion of the public, the importance of its active participation for the well-being 
of art, only implied in the article “Economic Laws and Art,” was here much more 
frankly acknowledged. De Zayas seemed finally to admit that the larger New York 


public must somehow be roused if art and “291” were to flourish in the United States. 


In the essay, moreover, de Zayas also began to suggest that this task of 
awakening the public could only be accomplished by means of an involvement with 
business as it existed in America, although here, not surprisingly, he was more 
equivocal. Throughout much of the essay, in fact, de Zayas vigorously attacked the art 
business for promoting the reign of “those Sudras of progress - the copyists.” Business 
in general was, moreover, also blamed for infecting the art public with the attitudes of 


boosterism that caused it to ignore the quiet efforts of a Stieglitz:

America has not the slightest conception of the value of the work accomplished 
by Stieglitz. Success and success on a large scale, is the only thing that can 
make an impression on American mentality. Any effort, any tendency, which 


does not possess the radiation of advertising remains practically ignored.172 


As in “Morituri te Salutant!!!...,” however, it is hard to establish exactly what de Zayas 
meant to say here, and the very variety of possible readings is perhaps itself revealing. 
Did he mean to condemn the public for understanding nothing but “success on a large 
scale?” Or, on the other hand, did he mean to fault Stieglitz for not making better use of 
“the radiation of advertising” in his promotional appeal to Americans? Was de Zayas 
perhaps suggesting that the machine drawings, which were explicitly based on 
advertisements, were an art that possessed some of this “radiating” power and, 


therefore had a chance of “success” in America? 


That de Zayas was not unappreciative of American business successes becomes 
clear farther on in the essay, when he lauds American achievements in a variety of 
fields, including some that were blatantly “commercial”: 


In politics, in industry, in science, in commerce, in finance, in the popular 
theatre, in architecture, in sport, in dress - from hat to shoes - the American has 
known how to get rid of European prejudices and has created in accordance 
with his own customs. But he has found himself powerless to do the same in 
art or literature... American artists have always had before them an inner 


censorship formed by an exotic education.1!73 


De Zayas’ description of the “surroundings” that American artists were encouraged to 
approach with such decisiveness was similarly characterised by an admiration for the 
individualism and frenetic activity that were the distinguishing features of business 


culture: 


One lives here in a continuous change which makes impossible the perpetuation 
and the universality of an idea. History in the United States is impossible and 
meaningless. One lives here in the present. In a continuous struggle to adapt 
oneself to the milieu....Each individual remains isolated, struggling for his own 
physical and intellectual existence. In the United States there is no general 


sentiment in any sphere of thought.!74 


Immediately following, de Zayas made a direct comparison between this turbulent state 


142

of mind and modern art. “America,” he asserted, “has the same complex mentality as 


the true modem artist.” 


The same eternal sequence of emotions, and sensibility to surroundings. The 
same continual need of expressing itself in he present and for the present; 
with joy in action, and with indifference to ‘arriving.’ For it is in action that 
America, like the true modem artist, finds its joy.175 


Admittedly, de Zayas envisioned the American artist as resembling the consciousness 
of the great American “unconscious,” or as an entity that would be able to express the 
more general state of mind. All the same, the relationship he postulated between artist 
and America appears to involve a considerable empathy and identification on the part of 
the artist with the subject at hand, as well as a marked similarity of spirit. It would 
seem, therefore that, even as de Zayas faulted business for hindering progress in art, he 
made room in the essay for a certain accommodation with its culture, suggesting that a 
business style or attitude might be necessary if modem art was to “succeed” in the 
United States. At the very least, de Zayas demonstrated an awareness that the 
production of art in America required a great deal of extroversion, a looking outward 
from art and from “291.” This was an attitude that seems very similar to the 


extroversion that had also brought Picabia out of his inward looking, abstract period 


and caused him to take an interest in American machinery and advertising.176 


Ultimately, the essay on Picabia and the significance of the machine-portraits 
for de Zayas had, I suspect, more to do with his own plans for “291” and art in 
America than with an American art as such. In a very interesting letter to Agnes Meyer, 
dated July 15, 1915, written after Picabia had arrived in New York and while he was 
working on the machine-drawings, de Zayas used some of the same language and 
imagery that appeared the essay, but did so in a way that was much more closely linked 
to the issue of business in art. The subject of the letter was, once again, the unfortunate 
state of inertia that “291” seemed still to be in, despite insiders’ best remedial efforts by 


means of the magazine. Near the beginning of the letter, de Zayas again despaired of

Stieglitz and his methods, although this time he provided more details about what was 
wrong. 


I don’t think that Stieglitz at heart is really interested in taking any 
definite attitude or in doing any particular thing. And he cannot be blamed. 
Anything he tries to do costs him an awful lot of trouble and annoyance. So it is 
up to us, especially you and me, to suggest to him if not a program at least a 
tendency. I believe we owe that to him.!77 


De Zayas went on to review the recent history of “291,” using words and images that 
were very similar to those he employed in the essay and explaining the role that 291 
magazine had played: 


Unconsciously we have brought 291 through our work in the paper 291 
from the beautiful realm of the metaphysical to a field of practical action. 291 as 
a group has taken a very decided personality. We have begun to form the inside 
instead of remaining a receptive place, which had for a business to test the soul 
of others. In my opinion we cannot continue to keep up being a mystery, an 
enigma, an eternal spirit to ourselves and to others. We are now in a position in 
which we will be able to show to ourselves what we are, what we can do and 
what place we really deserve, not among our immediate neighbours but in the 


world at large and in the evolution of modem art.!78 
The “metaphysical,” and the “eternal spirit” were here opposed to the “world at large,” 
and “practical action” in much the same way that the essay had contrasted “American 
intellectuality” and “metaphysics” to “joy in action.” In both letter and essay, moreover, 
de Zayas proclaimed himself opposed to inertia, and called for contact with the world in 


a forceful manner. 


In his opinion, de Zayas wrote to Meyer, more exhibitions of modem art would 
not, by themselves, help to distinguish “291” from other New York galleries in a 
meaningful way: 

Besides that work has already been done by Stieglitz in the Photo-S. with 


contrary results from what he expected. He tried to fight commercialism and it 
is commercialism which is now benefiting of [sic] all he has done, and as it 


always happens getting together to kill him or at least to nullify him. [sic]!79 
De Zayas then tentatively suggested that a more businesslike approach to art might be 


the answer to their problems:

At present it is in the power of Stieglitz to make of New York the world 
centre of the best elements of modern art. But to do it he would have to take a 
business attitude which for personal reasons and lack of capital he refuses to 
take. 180 


In the letter to Meyer the simultaneous condemnation and embrace of “business” that 
appeared in the essay on Picabia, was also present, but with more explanation. 
Business in art, de Zayas implied here, was an evil that should be condemned when it 
was in the wrong hands, but could be something good, exciting and useful when 
undertaken in the proper spirit for the right cause by entities such as “291.” The ideas 
expressed here should, I believe, be understood as forming the context in which “New 
York, at first, did not see...” should be read. When looked at in terms of the letter, the 
essay constitutes a further justification by de Zayas for the adoption of frankly 
promotional methods, beyond the compromises with business that the editors had 


already made in 291 magazine. 


These observations begin, I hope, to suggest the importance that the machine 
drawings held for de Zayas. Based on commercial advertisements and on that uniquely 
American monster, the machine, de Zayas seems to have found in Picabia’s new art a 
product of an alliance between art and business that was not tainted by the old “291” 
enemies, dishonesty, bad craftsmanship and philistinism. They seem to have been the 
visible proof that de Zayas needed to convince himself that something good could come 
out of America, and suggested that a further partnership between art and business was 
possible in other fields, perhaps even in the business of art itself. In many respects, the 
meaning that the machine-portraits held for de Zayas was not very different from their 
stated importance for Picabia. For both men these works embodied an escape from 
enclosed spaces, of art and gallery, where nothing important seemed to happen, out 
into the exciting world at large. But where, for Picabia, they symbolised the flight from 
Europe and the arrival at a new home, for de Zayas they represented an acceptance of 


the America in which he already lived. I suspect, moreover, that Picabia played a key

role for de Zayas in this process of accommodation. As a leading practitioner of the 
most advanced styles in art, his advice and example, like that of Apollinaire and other 
Europeans, carried great weight at “291.” When, in the past, Picabia had advocated an 
abstractionism of European origins, he had been heard with respect, and the response at 
“291” seems to have been equally strong when he suddenly adopted a machinist style 
and championed an “American” art. Picabia’s endorsement of work based on 
advertisements and the machine helped to legitimise for de Zayas the business culture 
that had been suspect at “291” for so long and thus took him farther along the road that 
would end in his going into business for himself. I suspect that de Zayas could not 


have arrived at this destination without Picabia’s example. 


By the middle of August 1915, a month after the letter to Meyer was written, 
she and de Zayas were discussing between themselves the possibility of establishing a 
commercial branch of “291” that would have as its sole business the sale of art. That 
establishment, named the “Modem Gallery,” opened, with Stieglitz’s approval, at 5th 
Avenue and 42nd Street on October 9, 1915. Before I discuss the gallery and the issues 
of 291 associated with it, however, I want to go back and look at the sexual themes that 
figure so prominently in 291 and which were used to such effect in the “New York, at 


first, did not see...” essay. 
Sex 


In this section of my thesis I want to look at that other conspicuous feature of 
291, the prominent place occupied in many issues by work that makes use of sexual 
and generative imagery, and to show how this material was related to themes in the 
magazine that have already been discussed. I will examine some of the sources of this 
imagery, the structure of the sexual discourse in 291, and the use that was made of it 


within the context of the very specific situation in 1915. A careful examination of 291

reveals that both writers and artists often employed a related set of metaphors, most 
notably ones that centred around the sexual polarities outlined earlier in this chapter, to 
image a variety of concems. Descriptions of love mating, and birth were employed to 
suggest other kinds of fulfilment and accomplishment, while images of sexual 
frustration, infertility and betrayal expressed more general forms of separation, 
incompletion and failure. Despite its diversity, the work in which this imagery appeared 
frequently concerned the creative act and its tribulations. Although such analogies 
between sex, birth and artistic creation were common in Romantic art theory, and thus 
hardly original to the “291” circle, the way in which the editors of 291 made use of 
these metaphors to rework their own ideas is somewhat less ordinary. As we shall see, 
this erotic discourse was extended to some of those issues relating to the public and 
business that so engrossed “291” insiders. Interestingly, sexual imagery was 
effectively used in 291 by artists and writers of both sexes. While I intend to examine 
work by both men and women in this one section, I will attempt to demonstrate the 
often subtle differences in outlook between their respective intellectual and aesthetic 


positions. Examination of work by women, in fact, often discloses a distinct critique of 


the male point of view. 18! 


As we have seen, works that made use of sexual imagery were present in 291 
magazine beginning with the very first issue. In that issue, items such as the poem “At 
the Arden Gallery” and the short article on Pascin had begun to eroticise the artist’s 
relationship with the city and with the art audience, while Alfred Stieglitz’s “One 
Hour’s Sleep --- Three Dreams” had laid out a distinct set of sexual polarities. Work 
that made more explicit use of such imagery, and or that focused specifically on 
relations between men and women, was, however, more in evidence only with the 
second issue, where, in fact, it seems to predominate. An untitled drawing by 
Katherine Rhoades that combined abstract forms with the “realistic” details of an ovum 


floating above and a sperm swimming below was reproduced, without further

explanation, on one of the inside pages [ Fig. 20].182 “Mental Reactions,” the “visual 
poem” by Agnes Meyer and Marius de Zayas that recorded a complex and somewhat 
bitter encounter between the sexes appeared on the opposite page and was one of the 
first of several literary works to appear in 291 written from a woman’s perspective[Fig. 
21.183 Two poems by Katherine Rhoades published in subsequent issues, “I walked 
into a moment of greatness...” (No. 3) and “Flip Flap” (No. 4), both of which 
described the reactions of an audience member during concerts, again established a 
decidedly feminine point of view, and used language that had marked sexual 
overtones. !84 Issue No. 3 also contained yet another poem by Agnes Meyer, simply 
entitled “Woman,” that, like “Mental Reactions,” disclosed a woman’s state of mind by 
introspective means.!85 Sexual themes were, however, most prominent in the issues of 
291 that were prepared during the summer of 1915. Francis Picabia’s “Fille née sans 
mere,” published in June (No.4) [Fig. 32], was followed in the July-August double 
issue (Nos. 5/6) by his “object-portraits” with their “jeune fille Américaine dans |’état 
de nudité,” and other slyly erotic references [Figs 33-37].186 As we have already seen, 
the accompanying essay by Marius de Zayas employed a range of sexualised slander 
and innuendo in its attempts to put the drawings into perspective.!87 In the subsequent 
issue, Nos. 7/8, Picabia’s notion of the “daughter born without a mother” was then 
taken up by Paul Haviland to describe photography as a mating with the machine. 188 


The last works with a conspicuous erotic content to appear in 291 were two “portraits” 
of a woman by Picabia and de Zayas, both of which made only slightly veiled 


references to sexual behavior and which were also characterised by a distinctly 


misogynistic streak [Figs. 43-44].189 


Before I look at these works individually, or even before I discuss their sources 
in the Apollinaire circle and the earlier writings of the Stieglitz group, I want first to 


address the more general question of why the editors of 291 felt they had to include so

much erotically informed material in the first place. I believe that the answer has a great 
deal to do with the general intellectual and social climate in which the magazine was 
produced, and with the efforts of the editors to promote the “291” gallery with 
reference to it. In the United States, as elsewhere, the second decade of the twentieth 
century saw the substantial breakdown of Victorian strictures on the discussion and 
expression of sexuality, and also witnessed the emergence of a dynamic and broadly 
based women’s movement.!9 Although complete sexual freedom was advocated by 
only a minority of individuals, sex itself was the subject of excited debate in educated 
middle and upper class circles generally and no place more so than in cosmopolitan 
New York. Such topics as birth control, the easing of social restrictions on relations 
between the sexes, the presence of greater numbers of women who went and did as 
they pleased, and the preponderance of sexually suggestive material in the press and 
advertisements generated considerable discussion. “Even a casual exploration of the 
popular literature of the Progressive era,” writes historian James McGovem, “reveals 
that Americans then described and understood themselves to be undergoing significant 
changes in morals. ‘Sex o’clock in America’ struck in 1913, about the same time as 
‘The Repeal of Reticence.’”!9! In July of 1914, Puck, the humorous weekly with 
which several “291” insiders were associated, and which was not above using quite 
rakish “pretty girl” covers to sell the magazine, parodied the modishness of sex in its 
Own unique manner: 


Once upon a time, to be exact it was sex days after Sexagesima, our sexdigitale 
young heroine of sweet sexadecimal years pushed the sexfoil gum to the other 
side of her mouth and with a sexly breath of regret slapped down the cover on 
the last page of the great sex best seller: ‘Take Off Everything, or, A Sex Story 


of Sexangle Love.’192 
In the metropolitan newspapers, issues such as birth control and women’s suffrage, 
both closely associated in the minds of contemporaries with the sexual “revolution,” 
received considerable exposure. In 1914 the subject of contraception had come to new 


prominence when birth control advocate Margaret Sanger fled the country rather than

face prosecution on charges of distributing “obscene” literature. When her husband was 
put on trial in her place, the newspaper coverage became even more intense.193 The 
year 1915, moreover, also witnessed a hard fought, though unsuccessful, campaign for 
women’s suffrage in New York State that received a great deal of attention in the press. 
Several widely circulated magazines of socialist and liberal persuasions, including The. 
Masses, The New Republic, as well as Puck, published special women’s or suffrage 


issues to mark the occasion.194 


One of the more noticeable manifestations of the tendency towards greater 
sexual freedom was, in fact, underway just down the street from “291” in Greenwich 
Village, where “sex” carried implications that were especially attractive to gallery 
participants. Among Village radicals a conviction that strictures on sexual expression 
should be eased involved not only 2 rejection of prudery, but also a more general 
repudiation of outdated Victorian morals and manners. Greater individual fulfilment and 
happiness, as well as more amiable relations between the sexes and in society as a 
whole were among the results anticipated. Advocacy of birth control similarly carried 
with it wide social ramifications. Increased access to contraception, it was believed, 
would not only make sex itself less distressing, but would also relieve mothers from 
constant childbearing and lead to smaller, more manageable families. Perhaps most 
important for “291,” however, more artistically inclined radicals expected that greater 
openness in sexual matters and a relaxation of censorship laws would make possible a 
more honest art and literature. With a full range of language and experience at their 


disposal, artists and writers would be free to deal with any subject in the manner they 


thought best.195 


Because the sexual revolution and the modern art movement could be seen as 
part of the same rebellion against obsolete and authoritarian standards, an intellectual 


alliance between “291” and Greenwich Village was a natural one. Not surprisingly,

then, Villagers and other radicals who advocated greater sexual freedom, such as 
Hutchins Hapgood, and even Emma Goldman, were frequent visitors at the gallery, 
and material that endorsed openness in sexual matters appeared in Camera Work from 
quite an early date. Sadakichi Hartmann’s essays on the nude and on Puritanism, 
published in 1910 and 1911, for example, were both a critique of a society that seemed 
habitually to divide mind and body and a call for greater honesty in art. In “Puritanism, 
Its Grandeur and Shame,” Hartmann deplored the fact that 


in painting, scarcely a breath of the great passions is palpable. In literature there 
is much pretence, but no deep thought of lofty imagination, and trace of realistic 
truth. The painter does not dare to paint a nude. The writer is afraid of writing a 
realistic love story. The artist as well as the public bear the troubled conscience 
of sinners... 

And as long as we...sit in snow up to our navels, and torment ourselves 
with conscientious scruples we will have no candour, no fire and dash in any 


intellectual act.196 


Hutchins Hapgood’s “In Memoriam,” published in the July 1912 issue, forged a 


similar link between an absence of prudery and excellence in art, moving quickly from 


youth and innocence to the nude. !97 


Although the treatment of such themes by 291 was generally more cursory and 
more sensationalistic than the earnest discussions characteristic of Camera Work, some 
of the same connections between art and wider social issues were made in that 
magazine as well. References to sexual matters in 291 were of two kinds. The first 
involved direct comment on controversial social questions by the short articles 
published as a monthly feature. One of the most interesting of these, entitled 
“Motherhood a Crime” from No. 2, which has already been mentioned, asked why the 
incidents of a girl’s suicide following an illegitimate pregnancy should be so briefly 
noted in the newspapers. The article concluded with a call to action: 


We go to see Brieux’s Matemity at the theatre. We applaud and adjourn 
to the the dansant. When it comes to the test what do we do?!%8

banned in London a few years before, severely condemned such modem outrages as 
men’s rights in marriage, the absence of access to birth control, as well as the stigma 
attached to illegitimacy.!9 Publication of this article by 291 signalled not only an 
approval by the editors of the liberal opinions expressed by Brieux but, somewhat 
surprisingly, also had the effect of suggesting that “art” alone was not a sufficient 
response to these issues. An unpublished number of 291, preserved in the form of 
dummies in the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., that was to have appeared in 
July of 1915, seems to have similarly been intended to align the magazine with the 
larger causes of social and sexual freedom.200 Two pages of this issue were to have 
consisted of drawings by Abraham Walkowitz of the dancer Isadora Duncan, widely 
regarded as a living symbol of free bodily and artistic expression, in the act of 
performing [Figs. 29, 30]. Another page was to have reproduced Walkowitz’s drawing 
of a (female) idol-like figure [Fig. 31] with the attached inscription: 


Marriage without license 
Religion without god. 


Taken together, the two parts of the unpublished issue suggested that a “primitive” 
spontaneity in art, represented by Duncan, and an absence of social-sexual 
prohibitions, embodied in the idol with inscription, were one and the same thing. 
Although such sentiments were hardly new to “291,” they had never before been so 
publicly proclaimed, nor so thoroughly connected with the spirit of modern art.201 
Once again, plans to publish this material seem to indicate a conviction, on the part of 
the editors, that art must move beyond itself and forge links with something outside the 
world of theatres and galleries. It is significant, however, that the issue was not, in 


fact, released, a decision that may have been influenced by a fear that 291, and “291,” 


were moving too far from their bases in the artistic avant-garde.20 


Most references in 291 to social-sexual issues, however, were not made in the 


form of such direct comments, but appeared in the guise of the sexually suggestive, but

rather ambiguous, allusions in Picabia’s machine portraits and Rhoades’ abstract 
drawing, or the loud, but hardly socially relevant, sexual rhetoric of de Zayas’ “New 
York, at first, did not see....” Much of the other work published in 291, moreover, 
while not sexually explicit, seemed also to identify the magazine with the easing of 
Victorian morality and a growing sophistication in sexual matters. The encounter 
depicted in “Mental Reactions,” for example, dealt with relations between the sexes, 
rather than sex itself, but did so in a quite unabashed and worldly manner. Such 
material, as well the large amount of writing in 291 on the subject of women, seems to 
have been included with an eye to contemporary social trends and to have been intended 
to draw attention to the monthly by its controversial nature.203 The use of erotic work 
for the purpose of publicity seems, in fact, to have been quite common in the period 
and even to have had some precedents at “291” itself. Not only had work advocating 
greater sexual freedom already been published in Camera Work, but some of the very 
first exhibitions of moder art at the gallery appear to have been arranged in the 
expectation that the art audience would be shocked by the explicit nature of the work 
shown. In his memoir of this period, “How, When, and Why Modem Art Came to 
New York,” written in the late 1940s, de Zayas noted that some of these pioneering 
exhibits at “291,” notably those of nude drawings by Rodin and Matisse [Fig. 39], had 
made an impact in New York as much for their alleged obscenity as for their vagaries of 


style.204 As evidence, de Zayas provided a review by J. N. Laurvik that appeared in 


the New York Times in April of 1908: 


The exhibition of drawings by Rodin at the little galleries of the Photo- 
Secession, 291 Fifth Avenue, is of unusual artistic and human interest. It is 
also a challenge to the prurient prudery of our puritanism. As one looks at these 
amazing records of unabashed observations of an artist who is also a man, one 


marvels that this little gallery has not long since been raided by the police.205 
Similar observations were made by critics on the occasion of the first exhibits of 
Matisse’s work.206 Commenting on this kind of criticism, de Zayas alleged that 


Stieglitz and Steichen had, in fact, been perfectly aware of what they were doing and

that he himself approved of their methods: 


Steichen must have seen in [Rodin’s drawings] all the elements needed to stir 
up things in New York. And they did. With this exhibition the Photo-Secession 
became the key which opened the doors of New York to modem art. 


It was, indeed, very wise of Steichen and Stieglitz to have started their art 
exhibitions with such drawings - the Photo Secession was put on the map as a 
radical, educational and immoral institution.207 


I suspect that the appearance of sexually informed work in 291 magazine may, in fact, 
have been a deliberate attempt to emulate these methods, which had been noticeably 
absent from Camera Work in recent years as that periodical tried to sort out issues of 
abstraction in art. As early as 1913 de Zayas, perhaps with these early shows in mind, 
expressed a desire to create a similar sensation with an exhibition of erotic art at “291.” 
In a letter to Stieglitz written in September of that year, he related that he had just 
attended two performances of quite risqué plays, but that they had been calmly received 
by the audience. He continued: 


I believe the time has come for the Secession to have the erotic art show you 
have in mind. If you don’t do it now maybe next season will be too late. New 


York is growing rapidly.208 
291 magazine seems, in part, to have been an attempt to hold, in a perhaps milder 


form, that erotic art show.209 


While the sexualised material in 291 was, as a whole, meant to draw attention to 
the magazine by its controversial nature, the particular kind of imagery used seems, 
however, also to have been intended to invoke a particular sexual and generative 
discourse that had recently been employed in the Stieglitz circle, and that the editors of 
291 wanted to engage. By 1915, thinking about art in the generative, if not explicitly 
sexually, terms that the “291” group had taken over from late Romanticism, had, in 
fact, become almost endemic at the gallery.2!0 As has already been noted, in the “What 
‘291’ means to me” issue of Camera Work, contributions to which summarised current 


thinking about the gallery, the slow progress of the “291”’s influence in the world was

likened to the growth of a plant, and the female birth function appropriated to describe 
artistic creation. Stieglitz himself was frequently characterised as the “Midwife of 


Souls,” a sort of catalyst that could bring art and ideas into life.21! In Camera Work as 


a whole, the especial proponent of this generative idiom was Benjamin de Casseras, a 
New York critic responsible for some of the purplest prose to appear in the quarterly. 
An excerpt from an article by Casseras on Eduard Steichen, published in 1910, gives 
some idea of how vast the concept of generation could become: 


We go toward ourselves. My images and thoughts are eggs. I enwomb and 
unwomb myself. I have infinities, eternities, nadirs, zeniths, boxed in my 
brain. I am always delivering myself to myself, cannot possibly forsake myself, 


cannot possibly exist in the world - seeing that the world exists in me....212 


A similarly Promethean conception of art and “291” characterised the “Means to Me” 
issue, where Katherine Rhoades, the future contributor to 291 magazine, allowed 
herself excesses that equalled Casseras’ in her evocation of the gallery: 


Day after day of supreme effort builded it, 

And upon day and night a sense of sound 

Whirling - as of a million elements up-gathering 
Centuries away - into present truth. 

A Spirit - held by human workers - holding them - 
Driving, beyond man’s death, a force unto greater life 


Endlessly creating.2!3 


Use of these kinds of sexual and generative metaphors allowed “291” artists 
and theorists to think of their work as unaffected, inevitable, and as powerful as nature 
itself. This imagery also had the added advantage that it could be put to a large number 
of uses. Although connected in a general way with “vitality” and “creativity,” 
generative imagery had a free floating currency among writers of the Stieglitz circle that 
allowed it to be enlisted in the service of almost any cause, including that of advanced 
art. Thus, in 1913, Oscar Bluemner was able to employ the language of fertility in his 


explanation of the importance of the Armory Show: 


The Intemational Exhibition of Modem art has become a fact in the life of the 
United States. That life has already spontaneously developed a germ of art. 
That germ could not but be fertilised by the progressive spirit of European 
culture, a culture in which the United States is fully a generation behind.2!4

Then, in 1913 and 1914, almost as if in reply to Bluemner, very similar metaphors 
were used by John Weichsel to disparage these same developments. Because 
Weichsel’s aims were censorious, however, he found it necessary to add infertility and 
impotence to the sexual equation. For Weichsel, avant-garde experiment was not 
evidence of new life, but “a logical miscarriage,” and “a deformed growth and an 
abortive outcome.” “How did this sterile bud,” he asked, “come to bloom on the 
glorious tree of the 19th century’s art, that meant to synthesize all virile and 
quintessential matter in its Cezannesque force.”215 The same sort of imagery was 


employed in Weichsel’s other essays with a similar intent. 


I suspect that the editors of 291, aware that generative metaphors had been used 
in this manner by Weichsel and other conservative critics, decided to reverse the poles 
of this imagery once again and apply its positive side to the avant-garde work they 
themselves admired. Thus, where Weichsel had employed organic metaphors to 
describe a relatively traditional art, and the relationship he believed it to have with a 
racial consciousness, writers in 291 used the same sort of language with reference to art 
that was difficult, experimental, and whose models were often mechanical. In contrast 
to the images of budding plants, pregnant artists, and so on, offered to readers by the 
“Means to Me” issue, 291 contained bizarre items such as de Zayas’ essay on the 
machine portraits, where advanced art was shown to be the product of fertile coupling 
between artist and the American city. De Zayas even saw fit to hurl Weichsel’s own 
epithet, “infertile,” at those who he thought had prevented the emergence of a modem, 
urban art in the United States.2!6 Paul Haviland, in his essay on photography for Nos. 
7-8, went even further to valorise the “artificial” art of the machine above all other kinds 


of creation: 


MAN MADE THE MACHINE IN HIS OWN IMAGE.... THE 
MACHINE IS HIS ‘DAUGHTER BORN WITHOUT A MOTHER.’ THAT IS 
WHY HE LOVES HER. HAVING MADE HER SUPERIOR TO HIMSELF,

Haviland and other writers in 291 seem to have developed a reproductive symbolism 
that magnificently suited the urban, seemingly deracinated art they admired. Their 
appropriation of the organic imagery used by Weichsel had the effect of rationalising 
and empowering this strange new art, thus making it, and not the art of the 


conservatives, seem the wave of the future. 


Although the sexual metaphors employed in 291 magazine were mobilised to 
meet such practical exigencies as the war with the conservatives, the inspiration for the 
use of this imagery, and the particular structure that it possessed, appears to have had 
yet another source as well. During the summer of 1914, Marius de Zayas was, as we 
have seen, in almost daily contact with Guillaume A pollinaire and his circle, the 
members of which frequently made use of the same erotic language that later made its 
appearance in 291, and it is thus probable that there was considerable influence on the 
“291” circle from France. Although de Zayas seems to have been the artist and critic 
most influenced in this regard, the work of Katherine Rhoades and Agnes Meyer, both 


of whom were also in France during the summer of that year, was probably affected as 


wel],218 


Sex was an aspect of Apollinaire’s work and life more important to him than 
any other except, perhaps, writing itself, and he made frequent use of generative 
imagery, including the notion of unaided birth, to describe the creative act. In his 
critical work, Les Peintres Cubistes, published in 1913, for example, Pablo Picasso 
was introduced as a sort of divine semiotician of art: 


A new man, the world is his new representation. He enumerates the elements, 
the details, with a brutality which is also able to be gracious. New born, he 
orders the universe in accordance with his personal requirements, and so as to 


formulate his relations with his fellows.219

Apollinaire was also very fond of obscene literature. The editor of a series of 
“forbidden books,” in 1914 he even produced two pomographic volumes of his own 
for quick cash. Sex in its more extreme forms was for him one of the great appetites of 


the artist, an act of will comparable to artistic creation, and something that set the artist 
apart from the rest of society.220 More broadly, sex was a requirement for successful 


work, and women were constantly in Apollinaire’s life playing the roles of companion 


and muse. From 1910, the object of his desire in this regard was Marie Laurencin who, 
to his great disappointment, then left him in 1912.22! Apollinaire took sexual betrayal 


badly, and such an incident usually brought out a misogynist streak in him that was 
reflected in his work. Scott Bates, an authority on the poet, sums up this aspect of 
Apollinaire’s art and life as follows: 


His lifelong quest could be termed the desire and pursuit of the whole....Eros 
was the connecting link between the two separate unities of man and 
woman....When as it recurrently happened, Eros turned into Anteros and led 
the poet to a woman of straw, he substituted for her other animae of his inner 
vision, revolution, nature, memory, the Muse, the Madonna, Eve, will, desire, 
and the modern world - or, in his nihilistic, onanistic works, himself, Lilith, the 


bitch-goddess, or a fatal illusion.222 


Among the artists and writers associated with Apollinaire, Francis Picabia 
seems to have had a very similar outlook on women and sex. Another divided man, 
Picabia claimed to have a great need for both, but, because these desires interfered with 
his pretensions to artistic omniscience, simultaneously resented the fact that he was so 
chained to them and it. A fascination and frustration with sex ran through much of his 
work, including the abstract paintings that had been displayed at “291” early in 1915, 
where pensive-looking, male forms appeared threatened by hard, devouring female 
ones [Fig. 16].223 Picabia’s biographer, William Camfield remarks, with reference to 


this work: 


Then and later on those themes revealed a man who sometimes viewed himself 
as a passive victim of sex, but was more often burdened by an insatiable 
appetite for woman as mother, muse and mistress...the conditions of his 
personal life were transformed into abstract compositions suggestive of more

universal longings, frustration and despair.224 


The sexual obsessions of these men converged when, in the summer of 1914, 
Apollinaire, Picabia, de Zayas and the composer Albert Savinio, collaborated on a 
pantomime entitled “A quelle heure un train partira-t-il pour Paris?” only Apollinaire’s 
script for which was ever completed.225 A sort of simultanist tableau based on 
Apollinaire’s poem “Le musicien de Saint-Merry,” the pantomime, which was to have 
been performed in New York the following year, had a very marked sexual content. 
According to Willard Bohn, in the poem 


one is...confronted with a grandiose sexual fantasy on the part of Apollinaire in 
which a personification of his own sexual member plays the starring role, an 


example of phallic narcissism translated into artistic terms.226 


Both poem and pantomime were, in fact, pervaded by that sense of frustration and loss 


that characterised other works of the Apollinaire group and that later made its 
appearance in 291 magazine.227 At one level, both works were about Apollinaire's 


recent separation from Laurencin, and the end of the pantomime, where the faceless 


man, the penis, leads a whole assembly of women to their deaths, constituted an act of 
metaphoric revenge on her.228 Participation in this collaboration seems to have made a 


deep impression on de Zayas. At some time, probably in 1914, he made a note on his 
copy of the script that recorded its significance for him, and which is worth quoting in 


full: 


Je pense souvent 4 ce malheureux que l’amour a banni de son royaume 
et qui, poussé par les commandements de la nature, cherche eternellement la 
consolation de ses maux dans la satisfaction de ses desirs barres. Et je benis le 
bordel car c’est le baume des blessures de ce grand crucifie qui s’appelle 
l’homme. Je pense souvent aux femmes indigentes qui sont enceintes, qui 
n’auront pas de lit pour accoucher de l’étre qui leur déchire le ventre. Et je 
bénis les maisons de maternité car elles sont le baume des blessures de cette 
grande doulouresque qui s’appelle I’femme. Et fe pense aussi qu’il y a des 
cerveaux qui sont bannis de la joie de vivre parce qu ils ne sont pas compris. 
Car la compréhension c’est la cohabitation de deux cerveaux.

kingdom and who, responding to nature’s commands, eternally seeks

consolation for his misfortune in the satisfaction of his thwarted desires. And I 
bless the brothel, for it is balm to the wounds of that great crucified being 
known as man. I often think of poor women who are pregnant, who will have 
no bed in which to give birth to the creature who is tearing at their belly. And I 
bless the maternity hospital, for they are balm to the wounds of that long 
suffering being known as woman. And I also think there are some minds that 
are banished from life’s joy because they are not understood. For understanding 
is the cohabitation of two minds.)229 


For de Zayas, it was apparently men alone who possessed an active sexual principle, 

while women only gave birth, passively. For both sexes, however, de Zayas foresaw 
enslavement, frustration and pain as the inevitable consequences of sex. Bohn, in his 

book on the pantomime, comments: 


For [de Zayas] the faceless man symbolised the masculine condition, driven by 
a sexual desire that he succeeded only rarely in satisfying. It is evident that this 
interpretation approximated Apollinaire’s own response. In both cases it was a 
question of a phallic individual who was obsessed with the sex act.230 


In his note de Zayas also made that metaphoric connection between sexual fulfilment 
and intellectual “understanding” that seems to have been so common among these 
artists and writers. Sex and the creative act were for him closely related and were 


capable of imaging one another. 


291 magazine, which appeared less than six months after de Zayas retuned 
from France, was replete with images, narratives and works of art that recalled 
Apollinaire, Picabia and the side of de Zayas revealed in the note. Earlier in this chapter 
I discussed certain works published in the first issue and suggested that they laid out a 
clear set of sexual polarities. In light of what is known about de Zayas’ collaboration 
with Apollinaire and Picabia, it seems likely that the use of these polarities in the 
magazine to image themes of fulfilment and loss also reflects the influence of similar 
treatments by members of the Apollinaire circle. This use of erotic imagery, although 
present in No. 1, was, however, more unmistakably introduced in No. 2, with the 
untitled drawing by Katherine Rhoades of an ovum and sperm seemingly sundered by a 


mass of abstract shapes that bear a strong resemblance to female reproductive

organs[Fig. 20].231 No explanation was provided in 291 or elsewhere for this 
enigmatic work, and it is probable that the drawing had a deeply personal meaning for 
the artist. At one level, the work may have constituted a veiled comment on Rhoades’ 
relationship with Stieglitz, who was in love with her at the time, but in whom she was 
not interested sexually.232 Narrow interpretations are unwise, however, for union and 
separation were the positive and negative poles of Rhoades’ poetic universe as well, 
and in her poetry she made use of similar images in a variety of contexts (see for 
example her contribution to the “Means to Me” issue, quoted above). Douglas Hyland 
has suggested that Rhoades’ untitled work may have some relation to “The Strike of the 
Uterus,” a charcoal drawing by de Zayas produced about 1915, that shows a skeletal 
hand preventing copulation [Fig. 40]. Hyland speculates that the untitled work may, in 
fact, have replaced de Zayas’ “Strike...” in 291 magazine, and that both may illustrate 
the short article, “Motherhood a Crime,” that appeared in the same issue.233 Whatever 
their functional relationship, all three of these works were clearly about some sort of 
proscription, of sex and birth, but also of fulfilment, at the personal, artistic and social 
levels. Rhoades’ and de Zayas’ depiction of a failure of sexual relations could, in fact, 
illustrate the note that de Zayas made on the script of “A Quelle heure un train partira-t-il 


pour Paris?” 


The same issue of 291 that reproduced the untitled abstract also published de 
Zayas’ and Meyer’s visual poem “Mental Reactions,” which, as we have seen, 


recorded a woman’s thoughts during a flirtatious encounter at a fashionable New York 
party [Fig. 21].234 Although the poem as a whole was a collaboration, Meyer was 


probably responsible for the text, while the layout was most likely the work of de 


Zayas. Like the Rhoades untitled, “Mental Reactions” seems also to have had a private 
meaning for Meyer that resists full disclosure.235 Separation was, once again, one of 


the major themes of the poem, not only between the sexes, but within the self as well.

As has been noted, the authors’ use of a simultanist-like style allowed them to set out a 
number of varied and often contradictory statements without direct authorial comment, 
a technique that was used effectively to image a state of intense self-division.236 
Although only the woman's thoughts are recorded, it appears, in fact, that the man in 
the poem does most of the talking during the encounter, leaving the woman somewhat 
overwhelmed. His masculine self-confidence leads her to infer that he speaks from a 
“greater experience,” a conclusion that causes her to question herself and condemn her 
own womanly reticence: 


He is telling me this... 
to find out whether I have dared to live... 


How can he bear to speak of it if it was real to him?... 

Ah, there you go, sitting in judgment from the per 
sonal point of view. He has the ability to give his very self. 
Be big enough to accept whatever is given you.... 


Odd. He gives me all he has to give. 
I think about myself.237 


For the woman the encounter seems to prove that while the man can “give” of his “very 
self,” she is unable to escape her own self-devouring thoughts, and can only “FLIRT” 
with life.238 Ultimately, however, she is unable to continue in the submissive and silent 
role prescribed for her within their brief relationship. She comes to realise that the man 
is only using her to perfect his “experience,” and that she is “nothing but his 
introduction to himself.”239 Hesitantly, she also comes to the conclusion that her self- 
questioning is, in fact, part of her own feminine experience. Eventually she flees the 


stifling encounter: 


I feel him making a mental note: 
“Experiment No. 987 


Reaction perfect” 


Why do we all object to being the lowest human common de- 


nominator? 
I really must go -

“Mental Reactions” is part of a larger critique of the male creative economy 
undertaken by women members of the group in the pages of 291 magazine. Works 
such as these appear, in fact, to present a view from the other side of that masculine 
fixation on women that found them necessary for personal and artistic affirmation. 
Meyer implied here that these kinds of relationships, even as they provided a degree of 
Satisfaction for the men involved, left their female participants frustrated and self- 
divided. For women, these encounters seemed to pose a threat of personal annihilation 


as their individuality was subsumed within men’s “greater experience”. Meyer 


suggested that, for women, “union” could be as dangerous a state as “separation.”241 


One question that might be asked about “Mental Reactions” is whether de 
Zayas, the male party in the collaboration, understood what Meyer was trying to do in 
the poem, and whether he brought his own masculine perspective to the work. Because 
de Zayas was responsible for its silent, visual elements, firm conclusions concerning 
his opinions are hard to draw. De Zayas did, however, have the opportunity of 
manipulating Meyer’s text, and his additions do, in fact, suggest that he considered the 
woman’s reflections to be just so much self-indulgence. Not only did he emphasise 
those parts of the poem, such as perfume and chocolate box labels, that were indicative 
of narcissistic pleasure, but also words such as “MYSELF” and “FLIRT” that 
suggest the woman was basically uninterested in the man, and only in herself. I would 
speculate that de Zayas either did not appreciate the complexity of the poem, or that he 
chose to read it as merely critical of the feminine character. I would also suggest that he 
interpreted the poem within the framework of desire and frustration that he had set out 


in his pantomime note. From a male point of view “Mental Reactions” can, in fact, be

read as a description of a relationship that is sexually unfulfilling and thus symbolic of 


the frustration suffered by “that great crucified being known as man.”242 


Two long poems by Katherine Rhoades published in the early issues of 291 
also dealt with women’s responses to male “genius.” The first of these, which begins 


“I walked into a moment of greatness...,” appeared in No. 3, together with a poem by 


Meyer on another page laid out by de Zayas.243 The other, “Flip-Flap,” was situated 


opposite Picabia’s drawing “Fille née sans mere” in No. 4.244 Both these poems 
recollected the thoughts and feelings of a (female) member of the audience during 
concerts, and were therefore further additions to that protracted discussion of the public 
that had its origins in Camera Work. Rhoades’ poems were unique, however, in that 
they approached the issue from the public’s point-of-view. The two poems seem to be 
in deliberate contrast. While “I walked into a moment of greatness...” describes a 
transcendence of self brought about by aesthetic experience, “Flip-Flap” is about a 
complete breakdown of communication between artist and audience. “I walked into...” 
takes place during a performance of Wagner’s opera, “Die Meistersinger, an experience 
that so overpowers the writer that she feels 


Everything had merged - there was no 

possibility of any retention of the separateness of a hu 

man self from the space of sound into which that senti 

ent self had projected. An extension of feeling and a dif 
fusion of music with it - creating a condition of oneness. A 


passing of each into the other.245 
Something is created during the encounter, and Rhoades’ language becomes almost 


erotic: 


Something greater than ourselves was breathing. What 
gave it the impetus to breathe? And if it could have en 
dured - if a climax could have been reached and held 
for the fraction of a second - would not that 1 

nstant have become infinite? Would it have 

been death? Or an escape - into a quicken 


ing of life?246

Whereas Rhoades’ untitled drawing had pictured separation, this poem anticipated a 
kind of ecstatic union. It was also a description of a kind of artistic fulfilment available 


to the public, here itself made into a work of art. 


In the other poem, “Flip-Flap,” nothing at all is created. Attending another 
concert, Rhoades can see only fake emotion being produced by the performer and smug 
self-satisfaction on the part of the audience: 

A man at a piano - thousands assembled, close, elbows touching, 
Waiting, 
Manufactured Soul-stuff for those who dare not 
create - 


Come and have your emotions played upon! 
You like to suffer - so?...247 


Rhoades, however, is not a passive member of the public. She objects to the 
manipulation of emotion that gives the pianist such complete control, and leaves to the 
audience only the role of “sounding boards.” For her, the concert seems intended only 
to serve as a temporary narcotic for those tired with life, a purpose that inhibits genuine 
transcendence. It is 


...this orgie -... this maze of sound and tensity - 
- where tuned-up Beauty flatters some few hundred humans, and 


lends them a vitality for this infected Now.248 


Like the woman in “Mental Reactions,” however, Rhoades rebels at the oppressive 
relationship, and the structures that allow it to exist. She feels “stifled - done for,” and 
realises that if anything is to be saved from this mess she will have to break out 
laughing: 


Out into this sea of dreadful stutterings I’d throw an inversion - 
a revision....249 


This alone might lead to transcendence: 


A Whole Self - laughing - 
Yes, all - only my body dead - left here - 


Flip-Flap -250 
Unfortunately, she is held back by a sense of “devastating repression,” and “Flip-Flap”

ends on a note of frustration.251 What is remarkable about the poem, however, is that 
in it Rhoades questions the importance of a type of creation coded as “genius,” and the 
public arena that gives it authorisation. Like “Mental Reactions,” moreover, this poem 
again suggested that self-doubt and disappointed yearnings could have a value in 


themselves, and might constitute a variety of feminine experience. 


Work by women was absent from 291 after the publication of issue No. 4 in 
June of 1915, and did not reappear until the very last number. Significantly, perhaps, 
the social conscience signalled by “Motherhood a Crime” and the unpublished issue 
also fell by the way at this time. There were undoubtedly some good practical reasons 
for these changes. In June of that year, Agnes Meyer was in the last stages of 
pregnancy and in the following months caring for a new baby left her unable to 
continue participating fully in the magazine’s production.252 Katherine Rhoades, the 
other woman member of the circle, who had been not as thoroughly involved with 291 
to begin with, appears to have spent more of her time at the family home in 
Massachusetts beginning in the summer of 1915.253 I suspect, however, that there 
were also some more sinister reasons for the sudden disappearance of work by women 
from 291. June, 1915 was also the month in which arch avant-gardist and 
mechanophile, Francis Picabia, returned to New York. On his arrival he and de Zayas 
again formed a close personal and professional relationship, and Picabia became, in 
effect, another editor of 291.254 Picabia, of course, had a rather ambivalent attitude 
toward women that bordered on misogyny, and cannot have been impressed by the 
presence of so much of their work in the magazine. It is very likely, therefore, that he 
was at least partly responsible for the change in editorial direction.255 Some evidence of 
changing attitudes at “291” does, in fact, exist in the voluminous correspondence 
between Katherine Rhoades and Alfred Stieglitz preserved at Yale University. In a letter 
dated July 10, 1915, Rhoades noted that she had not felt very welcome at the gallery

during her last visit, and speculated about the reasons: 


Of course I noticed that both you + de Z. were very quiet - that he [de Zayas] 
didn’t seem particularly interested in¢ in our silliness - ...preferred Picabia’s 
ear above - and his witticisms.256 


On July 30, 1915 Rhoades also expressed an unfavourable opinion of the machine- 
drawings, which had just then been published. “To me they are like intensely clever 


advertisements,” she wrote to Stieglitz. “They advertise, or express - Picabia - more 
than they do 291....”257 She also declared herself to be “delighted to see what the jeune 
fille Américaine is to him - it is illuminating!”258 J suspect that from June 1915 on, de 
Zayas and Picabia, with the possible cooperation of Meyer, decided to devote 291 more 
exclusively to advanced art of a brash and rather extroverted kind. A corollary to this 
change in editorial direction seems to have been the exclusion of extended pieces of 
introspective analysis, such as “Mental Reactions” and “Flip Flap,” as well as of work 
that hinted at a social conscience. Women’s writing seems to have been acceptable only 
as long as it gave the magazine a certain flair, and was discarded when something more 


exciting came along in the form of Picabia.29 


Picabia’s drawing, “Fille née sans mere,” reproduced in issue No. 4 [Fig. 32], 
was the first example to appear in 291 of a masculine art of omniscience that seemed to 
exclude women as a matter of necessity. The title of this strange work, which combined 
organic and mechanical forms, implied both that the machine-being portrayed was a 
new form of life created by man without the aid of “mother” nature, and that the work 
of art in which it appeared was itself the product of a similarly autonomous birth. The 
idea of machines as the superior creations of men had long held a fascination for 
European artists and writers such as Villiers, Huysmans, Jarry and others associated 
with the Symbolist movement. These writers, with whom the members of the Stieglitz 


circle were probably familiar, also habitually described machines as female, attempting 


in this way to express their deep affection for them.2

In his work, Picabia seems to have combined his knowledge of these sources 


with his own mania for mechanisation, recently reinforced by his experience of 
America, to create works such as the “Fille née sans mere.”261 Although his machine 


drawings appear, superficially, to border on non-art, the idea of the “fille née sans 
mere” that they embodied in fact made the very highest claims for both art and artist. 
The phrase implied that the (male) artist required no help from sources outside himself 
in the production of art, except, perhaps, from his fellow creators, the engineers.262 
Notably, relations with a female principle were not necessary for the creator of machine 
art, outside of the love affair he conducted with his own mechanical daughters. The 
sexual relations posited by such work were thus essentially incestuous and described a 
condition of masculine self-containment. Needless to say, living female companions, 
even for the purposes of “inspiration” or “experiment,” were superfluous to this 
relationship and were, in fact, inimical to it, as they represented something from outside 
the circuit of independent creation. In this mechanical philosophy, women’s special 


province, the birth function, was, of course, also entirely taken over by the male 


artist.263 


The machine portraits reproduced in the summer double issue of 291 were a 
further development of this “fille née sans mere” theme [Figs. 33-37]. Here, however, 
Picabia presented somewhat more magnificent creations, the products of his love affair 
with America, smooth and hard as the machines he admired. While these works 
should, I believe, be understood as yet another attempt by Picabia to gain power and 
omniscience by means of an artistic interface with the machine, they were, as I have 
shown in the previous section, not without satirical elements that undercut these 
pretensions to omnipotence. On the one hand, Picabia demonstrated a desire to make 
himself and his friends even stronger and more American by means of mechanical 


analogies. Picabia himself was therefore represented as a phallic-looking automobile

horn [Fig. 34], while Agnes Meyer, as we have seen, was depicted as the American 
super-flirt, confident in her nudity [Fig. 35]. On the other hand, certain of the 
individuals portrayed were shown to be flawed, and their defects, like their virtues, 
were imaged in sexual and mechanical terms. Dickran Tashjian has noted, for example, 
that the collapsed camera bellows in the portrait of Stieglitz resembles a limp penis, in 
what is probably another reference to Stieglitz’s impotence as an exhibitor [Fig.33].264 
Marius de Zayas, another artist with pretensions to creative omniscience, was portrayed 
as a machine that required some sort of sexual stimulus to function properly [Fig. 36]. 
These particular portraits seem to speak of a certain frustration, both sexual and 
otherwise, on the part of these machine-persons, not unlike that described by de Zayas 
in the note on the pantomime script. They also demonstrate an awareness on Picabia’s 


part that perfect creation out of nothing is, in fact, an impossibility. 


De Zayas’ essay on the machine-portraits, however, like other rhetoric on 
“machine daughters” in 291, largely ignores these satirical elements to read these works 
as symbols of power. For de Zayas, Picabia’s mechanical works were, as we have 
seen, an authentic American art that he hoped might, by force of example, retum artistic 
endeavour in the United States to its proper course. Picabia, de Zayas concluded, had 
looked without prejudice at his immediate surroundings to produce an art that faithfully 
reflected American life. In order to drive home these points about Picabia, de Zayas 
made use of an abundance of sexual innuendo and erotic metaphor that seems to draw 
on the “tradition” of such sexual usages that had been established by 291, and that was 
present, in a somewhat milder form, in Camera Work as well. What de Zayas now did 
was to combine the familiar language of sexual longing and fulfilment with the 
discussion of the American public to produce a powerful, if rather coarse-minded, 
synthesis. In the essay, de Zayas took a decidedly masculine point of view of the issues 


at hand, identifying artists and artistic promoters as the vessels of a male virility that 


could make things happen for art in America.265 The American public, that necessary

partner in the production of art, was, moreover, consistently feminised, and its 
indifference to modern work pictured as frigidity : 


___ New York, at first, did not see. Afterward she did not want to see. Like 
a circumspect young girl or a careful married woman, she has taken all possible 
precautions against assimilating the spirit of modem art; rejecting a seed that 
would have found a most fertile soil.266 


The male partner in the relationship, the “American intellectual,” was, of course, also to 
blame for this failure, and de Zayas used a language of sexual dysfunction to image his 

shortcomings. Preoccupation with foreign ideas, he concluded, had rendered American 
intellectuals infertile with their own kind: 


They believe themselves to have a luminous mission; but their light dazzles the 
eyes instead of illuminating. They wish to impregnate you, believing 
themselves stallions when they are but geldings. They are not a product of their 
country.267 


More generally, de Zayas indiscriminately labelled all tendencies he rejected as 
“homosexual,” “infertile,” and “gelded,” using, as has already been noted, John 
Weichsel’s terminology but with an almost opposite intent. These sexual insults served 
not only to denigrate the opposition, but also had the effect of further masculinising 


Picabia by force of contrast. 


The challenge for American art, as de Zayas saw it, was to overcome the 
public’s inhibiting shyness and artists’ lack of ardour and get these two parties into bed 
with one another. Much of the groundwork for the mechanics of this desired 
relationship had, of course, been laid in earlier issues of 291. The separation of artist 
and public that de Zayas deplored is, in fact, reminiscent of both the distance between 
male and female principles in Rhoades’ untitled drawing and the interrupted flirtation in 
“Mental Reactions.” More resonant still, however, are those pieces in the magazine that 
deal explicitly with the audience and the public. As early as the “Simultanist” poem in 


No. 1 made up of the conversation of women, 291 magazine had, in fact, feminised the 


art public.269 “Unilaterals”, another article that appeared in the first issue, similarly

situated the women artists, Marion Beckett and Katherine Rhoades, between the 
“inside” at “291” and the general public.270 Both these pieces implied that it was men 
who formed the true “inside” at the gallery and that women could best participate in 
“291” as consumers of art. Rhoades’ two poems in the early issues of the magazine 
were, as we have seen, actually written from the point of view of a female member of 
the audience, suggesting that the women members of the circle knew where they stood 
in the eyes of men. The aim of the performances that Rhoades attended seems to have 
been to ravish her by sheer power of expression, with the intention of bringing about a 
complete union between art and audience. In “New York, at first, did not see...,” de 
Zayas seems to express his wholehearted approval for the relation of dominance 
described by Rhoades and its aesthetic aims. The true American artist, he implied, was 


the kind of man who could successfully woo an audience of Katherine Rhoades. 


I believe, however, that de Zayas’ essay was a little more complicated than is, at 
first, apparent. The relationship between artists and public that he envisaged was, as I 
tried to show in the previous section, not entirely one of dominance, and neither was 
the ideal artist/promoter understood to be completely self-sufficient. In de Zayas’ 
Opinion, some participation from outside the ranks of art was, as we have seen, a very 
necessary constituent in the development of American art. There is, in fact another set 
of polarities present in de Zayas’ essay that is, I believe, even more important than the 
opposition of male and female he set out at its beginning. The negative pole of this pair 
of opposites was inhibition, both on the part of the girl-publics who used birth control, 
and on that of American intellectuals, the “geldings” and “homosexuals” of the art 
world. On the positive side were free, easy and fruitful sexual relations, where both 
partners were lusty and uninhibited, and none of this birth control nonsense was 


involved.271 Among modem artists, de Zayas found that only Picabia had been able to 


achieve the perfect state of desire that made such productive relations possible. 


Eschewing protection, Picabia had “married America like a man who is not afraid of the

consequences.”272 De Zayas implied that, if only American artists would follow 
Picabia’s example, then the United States would be truly aroused and the benefits 
would flow: 


In order to attain living results, in order to create life - no shields! 


America waits to be discovered. And there is but one way: ----- 
DISCOVER IT!273 


What I am getting at is that in his essay de Zayas demonstrated a willingness to let the 
artist, and by implication the artist-businessman, lose themselves a little bit in America. 
He professed a readiness to stand before the object without inhibitions, and suggested 
that what might happen in the ensuing relationship would not be his decision alone. 
Although the sexual relations contemplated by de Zayas were forceful, the encounter 
envisioned was not quite mastery and not quite rape. De Zayas seemed to imply that at 
bottom the artist and America were soul mates and that if they could only overcome 
their shyness they might have a lot of fun together: 


America has the same complex mentality as the true modem artist. The same 
eternal sequence of emotions, and sensibility to surroundings. The same 
continual need of expressing itself in the present and for the present; with joy in 
action, and with indifference to ‘arriving.’ For it is in action that America, like 
the modem artist finds its joy. The only difference is that America has not yet 


learned to amuse itself.274 


Of course, the metaphoric openness to the object described by de Zayas was 
still very male oriented. The required lack of inhibition lay mainly on the masculine side 
of the relationship, and de Zayas implied that it was by the action of strong male desire 
that the shyness of the public would be overcome. The intellectual and sexual candour 
advocated in “New York, at first, did not see...” was, in fact, quite similar to the 
“siving” described, and ultimately rejected, by the woman in “Mental Reactions.” Like 
the generosity practised as a seduction technique by the man in that poem, de Zayas 
seems ready to give of himself mainly in the expectation that he would receive himself 
back again, wiser and more powerful than before. De Zayas’ openness, therefore, 


remained very much within the relatively closed circuit of male creativity. All the same,

“New York, at first, did not see...” was nevertheless evidence of a supreme confidence 
on de Zayas’ part on the eve of his going into business. In the essay he declared 
himself able to set aside his misgivings regarding the anticipated relationship with 
America, in confidence that he would enjoy the experience and profit from it. This 
confidence seems, as I argued in the last section, partly to have been made possible by 
the presence in New York of Picabia, and the European artist’s role in de Zayas’ 
decision can now be seen to have had a sexual element as well. For de Zayas, Picabia’s 
masculinity was assured, and the example he provided of a modem artist “marrying 
America” without fear of “consequences” appears to have provided de Zayas with the 


virility he needed to do what before he had only contemplated. 
The Late Issues and the Modern Gallery 


In his letter to Agnes Meyer dated July 15, 1915, Marius de Zayas suggested 
that the two of them make efforts to persuade Stieglitz that a more forthright approach 
to gallery running was now necessary. If Stieglitz would only take a “business 
attitude,” de Zayas wrote, he could possibly “make of New York the center of the best 
elements in modem art.”275 Shortly thereafter, in the July/August double issue of 291, 
de Zayas praised the products of American business culture and the “joy in action” that 
had brought them into being.276 Earlier in this chapter I argued that, while the subject 
of this essay is art in America, it can also be read as evidence of de Zayas’ personal 
rapprochement with business in art. In neither the letter nor the essay did de Zayas enter 
into details of a plan of action, but within a month he and Meyer were more clear about 
their objectives: in the fall they hoped to fight the “commercial” galleries on their own 
ground. It was left to Agnes Meyer to inform Stieglitz, then at his summer place at Lake 
George, of their intentions. In a letter to him dated August 16, 1915, obviously written 
after close consultation with de Zayas, Meyer carefully set out the case for 


: : 
commercialism. After going over some of the same points concerning the gallery’s

continued ineffectiveness that she and de Zayas had made between themselves, she 
pointed out the very real danger of maintaining the status quo. The “Sudras of 
progress,” she warned, were now at work in the form of Armory show organiser 
Walter Pach and his associates: 


We felt above all things the danger that Pach and Co. would take up the thread 
where we have dropped it and make all your work worse than useless by 

letting it end in the ridiculous. We both (De Zayas said he spoke for Haviland as 
well) felt that the only field left is precisely the one that Pach contemplates - the 
scattering of works of modern artists among the American public. Now this 
may seem to you like commercialism only, but it is the only way of reaching the 
people - selling them things which they should live with and what is more 
important that they should have the right things? [sic]277 


The rather blunt tone of this letter seems to have been a consequence of Meyer’s belief 


that the situation had become so grave that complete “frankness” was now necessary 
even at the risk of offending Stieglitz.278 Despite her strong advocacy of a “business 


attitude,” however, Meyer maintained that their motives were, at bottom, altruistic: 


Another point - These men have no market in Europe now, the best of them are 
poor. What more natural than to help them reach a few of the people who are 


over fat with war-stocks?279 


Surprisingly perhaps, Stieglitz had no strong objections to their plan, which, as 
it soon became clear, amounted to the establishment of a “commercial” branch of 
“291,” to operate under de Zayas’ auspices, that would have as its primary purpose the 
sale of art. In a letter to de Zayas dated September 2, 1915, Stieglitz praised their 
decisiveness. “For years everyone seemed to rely on me,” he wrote, “I suppose that it 
was my fault that it was so....fortunately you saw - understood - took the initiative.”280 
To Meyer he wrote that, while he did not agree with her claim that “291” had “been 
dead last year,” he was all for the proposal.281 “TI see great possibilities in developing 


the practical side of ‘placing’ real work,” he said, 


The artists both in France and in this country need the ‘proper placing’ + the 
public too must be given a real chance. - I had at one time hoped that ‘291° 
would be able to bring this about in its own place - but envy, jealousy, 
personalities - forced me to eliminate that side virtually entirely. I’m glad De Z., 


Picabia, Haviland + you feel as strongly as you do.282

Stieglitz’s ready acquiescence to their suggestion was, in fact, a tacit admission that the 
charges Meyer and de Zayas had made were true, and that his old methods were no 
longer effective in the changed circumstances of 1915. An examination of these letters, 
however, and the ones that followed, also reveals that, while Stieglitz was enthusiastic 
about the project, his connection with the new gallery was to be of the same tenuous 
kind he had maintained with 291 magazine. De Zayas, Meyer and Picabia were to 
continue working on their own while Stieglitz kept an arm’s length relationship with 


“commercialism.” 


Meyer’s initial overtures to Stieglitz marked the beginning of a period of fervent 
activity at “291” that culminated in the opening of the Modem Gallery on October 7, 
1915.283 Details of the preparations that led up to this event are well documented in the 
correspondence with Stieglitz, who remained at his summer place at Lake George, and 
refused even the most impassioned requests to return. Although much of the material in 
these letters is unexceptional, occasional light is thrown on the “291” group’s aims and 
objectives with regard to the Modern Gallery, and on that sensitive subject, business in 
art. In two letters dated August 27 and September 1, 1915, de Zayas set out for 
Stieglitz’s benefit the principles on which the new gallery was to be run, and attempted 
to define its relation to “291.” These letters were long and repetitious, and seem 
motivated by a fear on de Zayas’ part that Stieglitz might withdraw his support for the 
scheme if he did not present the correct spiritual credentials. De Zayas was therefore 
adamant that the high standards that Stieglitz had maintained over the years would not 
be debased by “commercial” dealings, and that, despite their involvement with the new 
place, he, Meyer and Picabia would not neglect their work at “291.” The two galleries 
would complement one another, he wrote, but would be quite separate. While “291” 
engaged in “experiment,” the Modern Gallery would attempt to bring artists and buyers 


together on mutually beneficial terms: 


...our object in opening a new gallery is to do business not only to fight against

dishonest commercialism but in order to support ourselves and make others to 
be able to support themselves, in order to live, and make others live, and make 
them to be able to continue the evolution of modem art [sic]. Also to make New 
York a center of modern art commercially and intellectually. We are convinced 
that between 291 and the new gallery we will be able to accomplish that. 

It will complete “your work’ by different methods. 291 ‘purely 
intellectual,’ ‘purely commercial’ at the new gallery.284 


De Zayas’ repeated insistence that “291” should be kept “pure” began to suggest that he 
was relegating the old gallery to the realm of the “metaphysical” and therefore 
inconsequential. Such gaffs were probably unavoidable, however, given the intensity 
of de Zayas’ enthusiasm. Ironically, Stieglitz was often the more practical one in this 
relationship, counselling prudence and caution. In his letters from late August he 
warmed that “even a gold mine is not self-supporting in the first year,” and advised 
them to find enough capital to cover an initial loss.285 He also believed that a written 
contract with Picasso was essential if the gallery was to be a success.286 One need not 
necessarily infer a “commercial” attitude from Stieglitz’s frank discussion of such 
practical details. His advice speaks mainly of a greater knowledge of the risks involved 
in the operation of a gallery, and a fear that he might become too deeply caught up in 
the project, personally and financially. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see Stieglitz, the 


pillar of anti-commercialism, discussing financial matters with such evident 


proficiency.287 


Despite Stieglitz’s initial misgivings, preparations for the Modern Gallery 
proceeded quickly through August and the early fall of 1915. Fears for the gallery’s 
sustainability were allayed when Eugene Meyer agreed to back its finances for a year, 


and when a prime location was found at Sth Avenue and 42nd Street, the better “to try 
to get at the public.”288 Arrangements were also made with Paul Guillaume and other 

dealers in Paris for the delivery of pictures, a relatively easy thing to do at a time when 
the French art market was in severe depression.289 De Zayas also placed 


advertisements for the Modem Gallery in New York newspapers and in art magazines

that were very similar to ones run by “commercial” galleries such as the Montross. The 
group’s ambivalent attitude toward “business” in art seems, however, to have led to 
some uncertainty. An announcement for the new gallery, prepared by Agnes Meyer and 
J. B. Kerfoot, later reprinted in Camera Work, explained at length “291”’s reasons for 
going into business, and stressed the difference between their methods and those 
presumed to be the norm elsewhere.290 “We have already demonstrated that it is 
possible to avoid commercialism by eliminating it,” they wrote. 


But this demonstration will be infertile unless it be followed by another: 
namely, that the legitimate function of commercial intervention - that of paying 
its own way while bringing the producers and consumers of art into a relation 
of mutual service - can be free of the chicanery of self-seeking.29! 


This candid and idealistic statement was, however, never released, perhaps because de 
Zayas felt that it revealed too much about their business methods. The notice that finally 
appeared, inserted into issue No. 9 of 291 magazine, was much shorter, and pointed 
out only the new gallery’s avant-garde orientation and its close ties with “291.” 
According to this announcement, the Moder Gallery existed 


For the sale of paintings of the most advanced character of the modem art 
movement___Negro sculptures___pre-Conquest Mexican art__ 


Photography292 
They also maintained that 


The work of ‘291’ will be continued at 291 Fifth Avenue in the same spirit and 
manner as heretofore 
The MODERN GALLERY is but an additional expression of ‘291293 


The new gallery opened its doors to the public in early October, 1915, several weeks 
before other New York galleries, and soon after held a large inaugural exhibition that 


featured work by such major modern artists as Picabia, Braque, Picasso and Stieglitz, 


as well as African sculpture.294 


Although de Zayas, in his letters to Stieglitz, claimed that 291 magazine would, 


like the “291” galleries, be reserved for “purely intellectual” matters, the monthly was,

in fact, used to promote the Modern Gallery almost as soon as preparations for the new 
project were underway.295 Stieglitz appears quickly to have concurred with this 
decision, and he and de Zayas were quite frank about their motives in the 
correspondence. Two special issues of the magazine were assembled together late in the 
summer, but held back on de Zayas’ suggestion so they could come out concurrently 
with the gallery opening.296 As might be expected, both issues were very striking 
visually, and thus good copy for a gallery that specialised in modem art. Issue 7/8, 
dated September/October 1915, was entirely devoted to a high quality reproduction of 
Stieglitz's famous photograph, “The Steerage,” a work that resembled cubist and 
abstract art in its emphasis on formal values [Fig. 41].297 Stieglitz himself oversaw 
production of the prints, each of which was handsomely laid out on the finest Imperial 
Japan paper. Short articles, of the kind that had appeared in 291 earlier in the year, 
were to have been included in this issue as well, but were dropped, perhaps because 
they would have detracted from the overall impact.298 Instead, two short essays by 
Haviland and de Zayas explained Stieglitz’s work using ideas recently developed in the 


magazine and the by now familiar sex-generation imagery.2% 


The other issue, No. 9, dated November 1915, was even more visually 
oriented. Two cubist drawings by Picasso and Braque made up the covers [Figs. 42, 
45], while two “portraits” of a woman by de Zayas and Picabia were featured on the 
inside [Figs. 43-44].300 These latter two works were very aggressive in both style and 
content, and were published without distracting editorial comment. Although this 
second issue was intended to be the one more closely linked with the opening of the 
Moder Gallery, its precise import is not very clear. In a letter to Stieglitz dated August 
23, 1915, de Zayas stated that, taken together, the drawings by Picasso and Braque on 
the covers and the “portraits” he and Picabia had “made about Elle” on the inside, 


would help to demonstrate their intentions with regard to the Modem Gallery in visual

form. “Instead of making promises,” he wrote, “we tell them what we are doing, 
showing at the same time the relationship of the two galleries.”301 The “tell” in de 
Zayas’ letter obviously refers to the sheet announcing the opening of the gallery that 
was included with each copy, but the “showing” is more mysterious. Although precise 
interpretations are not possible, I would speculate that the severe and elegant Cubist 
covers were meant to represent the intellectual side of the group’s endeavours, now to 
be pursued at “291”, while the aggressive inside pages should be identified with the 
more commercially oriented Modem Gallery. Taking their cue from 291 magazine’s 
sexual-sophisticate image, these two works indicated that the new place would be 
brash, up-to-date, and willing to take risks. Given the strong association of this entire 
issue with the Modern Gallery, however, it seems clear that the Picasso-Braque covers 


also pointed to aspects of its activity, suggesting that the leaders of French Cubism had 
their spiritual and commercial home there as well.302 Whatever the relationship of 
pictures to galleries, Stieglitz thought the issue such good advertising that he suggested 
de Zayas have 2000 copies printed if he thought it “desirable.”303 A copy of No. 9 was 
thus sent to art reviewers at each of the major New York newspapers and to many 
Americans and Europeans involved in the arts.304 Also at this time, Ezra Pound, the 


expatriate American poet living in London, received a large number of copies of 


Camera Work and a full set of 291, with a letter expressing interest in any mention 


Pound might make of these periodicals in reviews.305 


The other issue, devoted to Stieglitz’s photograph, “The Steerage,” appears, at 
first sight, to have less of a connection with the Modern Gallery and there is, in fact, 
some evidence that the editors of 291 intended from the outset to make Stieglitz’s print 
available in a deluxe edition.306 However, as plans for the new gallery developed, de 


Zayas seems to have realised that the photograph could be used to identify Stieglitz 


closely with the new business providing it was presented to the public at the right time.

Thus, while the “Steerage” issue was laid out together with No. 9 in August of 1915, 
its release was also held back to coincide with the Modem Gallery opening in October, 
when the famous photograph and other works by Stieglitz would be on view in the 
inaugural exhibition.307 Exhibition of the print and its simultaneous publication in the 
magazine provided massive visual evidence of Stieglitz’s endorsement of the new 
gallery, and linked his reputation for quality and integrity firmly with the enterprise. 
Not surprisingly, the essays published with the photograph attempted to enhance 
Stieglitz’s prestige at a time when his support was most needed. In the course of his 
efforts to explain Stieglitz’s importance de Zayas maintained not only that “Stieglitz 
comprises the history of photography in the United States,” but also claimed that he 
was the American counterpart of the great European avant-gardists.308 “We have 
escaped from the fetishism into which that word ‘Art’ had hypnotised us,” he wrote, 
“making us sensitives to the respective realities of our inner selves, and of the outer 
world.” 


A group of men in France has flooded our inner world with the light of 
a new plastic expression. Stieglitz in America, through photography, has 
shown us, as far as is possible, the objectivity of the outer world.309 


De Zayas’ comments effectively placed Stieglitz’s photographic innovations in a course 
parallel and complementary to artistic developments in Europe, thus enlisting the 
proprietor of “291” in the ranks of the painters who were to be exhibited at the Modem 


Gallery. 


Paul Haviland’s essay associated photography with the European mainstream in 
a similar fashion.3!0 By applying the European concept of the “fille née sans mere” to 
this “American” art, Haviland implied that Stieglitz had been able to create work with 
universal significance in spite of his provincial origins, and that by wedding modern 
man to modem machinery he had, in fact, done even better than the Europeans. These 


attempts on the part of de Zayas and Haviland to find in Stieglitz’s art a fulfilment of

both European and American aspirations were, needless to say, addressed to readers on 
both sides of the Atlantic. The essays, which appeared in both French and English, 
interpreted Stieglitz in terms that gave him greater importance for American admirers of 
the avant-garde, while, at the same time, demonstrating to Parisian artists and dealers 
that the United States was, in spite of appearances, quite in the thick of recent 
developments. It is probably no coincidence that “The Steerage” was one of Stieglitz’s 
most formally severe photographs, and that it had been praised by Picasso when de 


Zayas showed him a print in the summer of 1914.31! 


From the intellectual and stylistic points of view, the works contained in both 
the “Steerage” and the “Modern Gallery” issues were quite similar to material that had 
previously been published in 291. These continuities had the effect of linking the 
Modem Gallery with the bolder, more outgoing, image that the editors had been trying 
to create for themselves through the magazine. Sexual and generative imagery was 
strongly in evidence, and although business and the American public were not explicitly 
discussed, the relationship between the artist and that uniquely American entity, the 
machine, was the subject of essays by Haviland and de Zayas. The works published 
also made use of those polarities of union and alienation that had been so conspicuous 
in the past. What was new, however, was an even greater “masculinisation” of the act 
of artistic creation, accompanied by a misogynistic streak that tended to exclude women 


from the artistic process altogether. 


The two essays in the “Steerage” issue took up themes that had been developed 
over the summer by Picabia’s machine drawings, and in de Zayas’ essay, “New York, 
at first, did not see....” Haviland's use of the concept of the “daughter born without a 
mother” to describe photography seems to owe most to this earlier work, but a careful 
reading of de Zayas’ more sober piece reveals that it too has much in common with 


what had gone before. This essay, which does not have a title, attempted to describe

just what it was that Stieglitz did when he took a photograph. De Zayas argued that 
photography was essentially directed toward “objective fact,” and that Stieglitz, almost 
alone among photographers, had achieved the perfect state of consciousness that 
allowed the camera to make an accurate record of the world: 


_ I speak of that photography in which the genius of man leaves to the 
machine its full power of expression. For it is only thus that we can reach a 
comprehension of pure objectivity. 

Objective truth takes precedence over Stieglitz in his work. By means of 
a machine he shows us the outer life... 


And in seeking truth he has acted as a real creator.312 


Although these ideas were based on theories of photography that de Zayas had earlier 
published in Camera Work, it is interesting that the suppression of individuality he 
imputed to Stieglitz bears such a strong resemblance to the state of mind possessed by 
the ideal American artist in “New York, at first, did not see....”313 There, de Zayas 
had argued that Americans should endeavour to achieve a similarly direct and 
unmediated relationship with their surroundings if they were to make a significant 
contribution to modem art. Picabia, the only successful “American” artist, was 
described in terms very similar to those later applied to Stieglitz: 


He does not protect himself with any shield. He has married America like a man 
who is not afraid of the consequences. He has obtained results. And he has 
brought these to ‘291’ which accepts them as experience, and publishes them 
with the conviction that they have the positive value which all striving 


toward objective truth possesses.314 
De Zayas’ description of Stieglitz in the same manner as Picabia implied that 
Americans, like their European colleagues, were at the very forefront of new artistic 
developments. In the essay, incidentally, de Zayas also demonstrated his continued 
belief in the value of an extroverted attitude on the part of the artist toward the world at 
large, and a confidence that America had something to offer to those who could remain 
focused on the “objective.” De Zayas’ faith in an easy commerce between inner and 
outer showed him still at his most sanguine on the eve of going into business. If I am 


right about the subtext in “New York, at first, did not see...,” then the “Steerage” essay

is further evidence of his continued love affair with the “commercial” aspects of 


American culture. 


Whereas the “Steerage” essay pointed to an openness on de Zayas’ part to his 
surroundings, Haviland’s contribution to the issue implied quite the opposite. Although 
his piece exhibited some of the same confidence in the value of an art produced by 
means of a machine, its exclusive use of the image of the “daughter born without a 
mother,” with its suggestions of artistic omniscience, suggests that Haviland was much 
less willing to allow something from outside the artist into the process of creation. In its 
essentials, Haviland’s argument was that photography had proved itself one of the best 
examples of a fruitful relationship between artist and machine. Machines, in his 


99 66s 


opinion, were (female) beings created by “man” “in his own image,” and photography 


was one of the admirable products that had resulted from the union with this new 
birth.3!5 Haviland, as he worked out his ideas, seems, like de Zayas, to have come 
under considerable influence from Picabia, and much of what he had to say about 
photography could as easily apply to images such the “Fille née sans mére.” As has 
already been noted, the idea of machines as artificial life created by men, and their 
sexing as female, had a long history in European art and literature. While fantastic 
creations such as Picabia’s “Fille” were often entertaining they were also in quite deadly 
eamest. On the one hand, these visions of a sort of Nietzschean self-overcoming by 
technological means, were attempts, on the part of the artist, to appropriate the superior 
power of technology for art. On the other hand, however, these fantasies can also be 
understood as efforts to restrain the seeming autonomy and influence of technology by 
subordinating it to the will of the artist.316 An appropriation of technology and a 
simultaneous desire to control it seems, in fact, very much present in Haviland’s essay. 
At the beginning of the piece, he expressed an admiration for machines that even 


allowed them a predominant place in art: 


MAN HAS MADE THE MACHINE SUPERIOR TO HIMSELF. 
THAT IS WHY HE ADMIRES HER. HAVING MADE HER SUPERIOR TO

HIMSELF, HE ENDOWS THE SUPERIOR BEINGS WHICH HE 
CONCEIVES IN HIS POETRY AND IN HIS PLASTIQUE WITH THE 
QUALITIES OF MACHINES.317 


Farther on in the essay, however, Haviland showed himself equally anxious to keep the 


machine in a subordinate position: 


MAN GAVE HER EVERY QUALIFICATION EXCEPT THOUGHT. SHE 
SUBMITS TO HIS WILL BUT HE MUST DIRECT HER ACTIVITIES. 
WITHOUT HIM SHE REMAINS A WONDERFUL BEING WITHOUT AIM 
OR ANATOMY .318 


Then, in the final sentences of his essay, Haviland claimed that it was, in fact, only the 
male principle, embodied in the (male) artist, that could fully bring out the machine’s 
latent potential: 


THROUGH THEIR MATING THEY COMPLETE ONE ANOTHER. SHE 
BRINGS FORTH ACCORDING TO HIS CONCEPTIONS. 
PHOTOGRAPHY IS ONE OF THE FINE FRUITS OF THIS UNION. 
THE PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINT IS ONE ELEMENT OF THIS NEW 
TRINITY; MAN, THE CREATOR, WITH THOUGHT AND WILL; THE 
MACHINE, MOTHER-ACTION; AND THEIR PRODUCT, THE WORK 


ACCOMPLISHED.319 


The desire to control the machine revealed in Haviland’s essay was very similar, in 
some respects, to contemporary efforts to keep independent-minded women in their 
place, and the two exigencies were, in fact, mapped on to one another here.320 I 
suspect that Haviland’s need to discipline the machine also belied his considerable 
anxiety in the face of supposed threats to his artistic autonomy from the modem world. 
The relations with the machine postulated by Haviland’s piece were, therefore, different 
from the “mating” with the “objective” as imagined by de Zayas in his essay. Although 
de Zayas’ ideal relationship with the outer world was, of course, open to some of the 
criticisms levelled at male “giving” that were discussed earlier, his open-ended 
conception of photography seemed at least to leave room for a certain interaction with 
the “objective.” The ambivalence toward the machine present in Haviland’s essay, on 
the other hand, would seem to speak of a certain ambivalence and anxiety on the part of 


the editors of 291 as they prepared to meet the modem world and go into business for

The misogyny implicit in the notion of the “fille née sans mere” came to the fore 
in the two portraits of “Elle” by Picabia and de Zayas published in 291 No. 9, the 
“Modem Gallery” issue [Figs. 43-44].322 Although the two artists claimed to have 
been working independently, the portraits were, if an article in the magazine Arts and 
Decoration is to be believed, depictions of the same unidentified woman.323 De Zayas 
and Picabia seem also to have intended their work to provide more than just an accurate 
depiction of an individual person. Katherine Rhoades, in a letter to Stieglitz written at 
about the time the two men initiated their project, mentioned some work that “De Z. and 
Picabia are doing - expressing an objectivity of - say woman - or city....”324 While 
hardly conclusive, the evidence of the letter suggests that the two artists were engaged 
in some sort of abstraction of “woman” in general as part of their positivist-artistic 
endeavours. The results of their collaboration were striking, if somewhat disturbing. 
Picabia’s portrait, entitled “Voila Elle” [Fig. 44], presented readers with a decidedly 
female “fille née sans mere” in possession of a kind of internal feedback mechanism. 
Although the drawing is open to a variety of interpretations, it would seem that, when 
the machine is in operation, the pistol at bottom fires at the target, the impact of bullets 
on which recocks the gun, starting the firing process over again. Smoke and heat 
produced by these mechanical exertions are taken away by the stovepipes in the 
background. The self-initiated firing mechanism illustrated in the portrait points to some 
sort of masturbatory or other self-indulgent activity on the part of the “woman” 
portrayed that, in Picabia’s opinion, causes her nothing but harm. The woman depicted 
in de Zayas’ “Femme!” [Fig. 43] shared many of these same traits, although de Zayas 
was able to be somewhat more specific. Using a Simultanist style that laid words out in 
an abstract formation, de Zayas showed the woman to be stupid (“pas 


d’intellectualisme”), silly (“hurluburlu”), materialistic (“atrophie cérébrale causée par

matérialité pure”), and interested only in pleasure (“elle n’a pas la peur du plaisir”). She 
is also a drunk (“ivre - ivre bonne - ivre morte”), and is self-destructive (“jouissance d 
déchirer son étre social”). Worst of all, however, she is “pas le miroir de son male,” 
not the image of what men want her to be.325 Needless to say, both de Zayas’ and 
Picabia’s portraits were blunt in their choice of imagery, and the depictions were 
consistently derogatory.326 The two artists made use of time-womm cliches about 
women’s vanity, self-absorption, and danger to men, merely updating them to 
twentieth-century proportions. The bluntness of the portraits can partly be explained by 
a desire to attract attention to them, which, in fact, is what happened when the works 
were shown in the opening exhibition at the Modern Gallery. The reviewer for Arts and_ 
Decoration found that “the portraits were a revelation in themselves, one that brought 


the word naughty to mind more rapidly than any other....”327 


Like Haviland’s essay on photography, the two portraits of “Elle” seem very 
much a product of fear, and speak of a deep insecurity in the face of women’s 
increasing claims to independence in society at large, and perhaps to their greater 
participation in “291.” Not surprisingly, both portraits were of women who, even as 
they exhibited a disturbingly self-destructive tendency, also possessed a self- 
sufficiency that seemed to preclude the need for masculine attention. Picabia’s “Voila 
Elle” depicted a woman-being enjoying a pleasure apparently achieved without 
masculine assistance, while the woman in de Zayas’ “Femme!” failed in her duty to be 
“the mirror of her man.” De Zayas’ poem seems also to present yet another one of those 
unfulfilled relationships that were so common in 291 magazine, for if the handwritten 
sentence toward the bottom right is to be believed, this woman had also rebuffed the 
author’s amorous advances. “Mais je vous aime et vous devez bien m’aimer un peu,” 
pleads de Zayas. Aspects of this poem, in fact, strongly bring to mind the equally 
unfulfilled relationship described in “Mental Reactions” [Fig. 21], a work in which de 
Zayas also had a part. Women portrayed in both these poems exhibited a confusion and

self-absorption that were interpreted as vanity by the male artist, and both possessed an 
independent streak that led them to disregard the overtures of men. De Zayas even 
signalled his disapproval of their rebelliousness in similar ways, most notably by the 
accentuation of perfume and make up labels (“OPIUM-COCO,” “ROUGE BLEU 
JAUNE” in “Femme!”, “PARFUMERIE DE NICE,” “PARFUM ULTRA 
PERSISTANT™ in ”Mental Reactions”).328 From the masculine point of view the 
women in “Mental Reactions,” “Femme!,” and “Voila Elle” were all bad machines and 
bad women. In all three works, Picabia and de Zayas attempted to manage their 
wilfulness by subordinating their subjects to the controlling hand of the artist.329 
Women who exhibited a taste for autonomy were here tumed into obedient “filles nées 
sans mere,” products of the artist’s own autonomy. Exhibition of these works, in effect 


a public exposure of women’s sins, served as a further means of control.330 


The last two issues of 291, Nos. 10-11 (December 1915/January 1916) and 
No. 12 (February 1916), are something of a disappointment. While they contained 
much that is interesting and challenging, they lack the unity of earlier issues and are not 
nearly as visually exciting. Moreover, despite the appearance of several more “fille nées 
sans mere,” neither issue adds much that is new to the sexual-mechanical theme, and 
the dialogue on public, business and art is missing as well. The presence of these 
themes had been responsible for some of the more interesting work to appear in 291, 
and without their impetus the magazine lost something of its edge. Notably, American 
art, as such, was no longer an issue either, and although a few examples of work by 
American artists did appear, a uniquely American modernism no longer seemed to 
interest the editors very much. These changes in 291 probably stemmed from the fact 
that, in these last two issues, the magazine was little more than a vehicle for the 
promotion of the Modem Gallery. That space between the editors’ ambitions and the 
reality of the American situation that had provoked some of the magazine’s more 


outrageous attempts to find a place for itself was now missing and was replaced by an

almost complete identification of means and end. To use a sexual analogy, of a type that 
de Zayas himself might have used, these late issues had a distinctly post-coital air to 
them, as if the courtship was now over and the relationship with the public had been 
consummated. The public, previously the subject of much speculation in the magazine, 
had now to be met on a daily basis at the gallery itself and, with cash riding on the 
outcome of transactions, the editors probably decided that it was not prudent to shock 
the audience very much. Rather, it was offered European work marked as difficult and 


therefore valuable. 


In its last incarnation, then, 291 became the in-house publication of the Modern 
Gallery. Picasso, with whom the proprietors perhaps wanted most to be associated, 
occupied a very prominent place, both in the magazine and at the gallery. His work was 
shown in the inaugural exhibition from October 16(?) through November 13, 1915, 
and again only a month later, between December 18, 1915 and January 1, 1916. Not 
surprisingly, the cover of Nos. 10/11 (December 1915/January 1916), the first issue of 
291 to appear after the opening of the gallery, reproduced a Picasso collage of the 
synthetic period on its cover [Fig 46]. Inside, a portrait of Picasso by de Zayas, 
showing a bull-like figure and a rose, created a brooding, romantic image of the artist, 
similar to that which later inhabited popular imagination [Fig. 47].33! Picasso also 
figured prominently in Max Jacob’s column, “La Vie Artistique,” published in both 
these issues.332 Although de Zayas had assured Stieglitz that he would resist the 
temptation to bring out his own or Picabia’s works for the purpose of publicity, 
Picabia’s machine drawings and paintings also received extensive exposure.333 Within 


the space of five months his work was exhibited in the opening exhibition, again 
between January 5 and 22, 1916, and then once more from February 12(?) through 
March 4, 1916. In 291, two of Picabia’s machine drawings were reproduced in Nos. 
10/11 [Figs. 48-49], while a statement by the artist made an appearance in No. 12

(February 1916) to coincide with his last show of the season.334 African sculpture, de 
Zayas’ special purview, was on view at the gallery almost without a break from 
October of 1915 until February of 1916, and received similarly extensive coverage in 
291, notably in the form of a reprint in No. 12 of de Zayas’ 1914 statement on the 
importance of African sculpture for modern art.335 As if to underline its new 
orientation, 291 magazine displayed an utter lack of interest in the New York art scene 
outside the doors of the Modem Gallery. No comment at all was made on exhibitions at 
the other “commercial” galleries, nor did activities at Stieglitz’s “291” receive 


mention.336 


The work that appeared in the last two issues of 291 varied considerably in 
quality and substance. The ideas expressed in the essays published were often rather 
bland, and added little that was really new. De Zayas’ little piece on African art in No. 
12 had, in fact, originally been released over a year before in the form of a catalogue for 
the first African sculpture exhibition at “291.” A summary of de Zayas’ ideas on the 
influence of African art on modem “Form,” its publication in 291 gave the perhaps 
mistaken impression that de Zayas had returned to his interests of two years previous, 
and that he had been unaffected by his association with “Simultanism.” Picabia’s essay 
in the same issue was couched in the familiar language of subject and object that had for 
years been used to justify abstraction, and contributed little to the understanding of his 
machine art. Interestingly, his statement was so general that his comments seem to 


apply equally well to both abstract art and machine works, and it is hard to say just how 


it fit into the present context.337 
The most interesting work in these last issues came from members of the 


Apollinaire circle in Paris, and from American women artists and writers, whose work 


made a belated reappearance in the final number. Two women were represented. Mrs.

A. Roosevelt, an artist about whom very little is known, exhibited a work entitled 
“Tennis Player - Serving” in the spring sculpture show at the Modern Gallery, anda 
photograph of this severe and formal structure was duly reproduced in the magazine 
[Fig. 50].338 The same issue also published yet another poem by Katherine Rhoades 
entitled “Narcosis.”339 One of her better poetic efforts, it can be interpreted as a critique 


of the interest displayed by certain male members of the group in the more frenzied 
aspects of modernity. Rhoades’ poem seemed to question the value of the city and its 
“joy in action”:

French contributions, however, dominated the later issues, and their strong 
presence probably reveals much about what de Zayas was now attempting to do with 
291. Having succeeded in drawing a considerable amount of international attention to 
the magazine, he seems to have tried to use these last issues in a final effort to make 
New York a centre of French artistic activity.341 Almost all the European work 
published had a common origin with artists and writers championed by Apollinaire, 
probably still the most important figure in the Parisian avant-garde. Picasso and Picabia 
were both associated with him, and the French literary works published, all of which 
appeared without English translations, had the same pedigree. Some of these items 
were very strange things indeed and would have appealed only to readers with the most 
rarefied tastes. Ribemont-Dessaignes’ poem, “Musique,” which appeared in Nos. 


10/11, for example, was a lyrical piece of avant-gardism that made use of an almost 


surreal juxtaposition and choice of words.342 The last two issues also featured a

column by Max Jacob headed “La Vie Artistique” that purported to relate the art news 
from Paris. Incorporating nonsense, parody, and black humour, it could not have been 
appreciated by anyone without a thorough knowledge of the personalities and 
tendencies in contemporary French art and literature. Picabia’s machine portrait of 
Jacob in No. 12 [Fig. 49] made allusion to the writer’s recent conversion to 
Catholicism, an event that had caused some amusement among his friends, but that 
would have been of little interest to those unacquainted with the man or his work. 
These items of French origin seem to have been included in 291 both with an eye to the 
curiosity they might arouse in New York and with a Parisian readership in mind.343 In 
1916, in fact, Parisian and New York audiences were becoming more alike as French 
artists and writers in considerable numbers travelled to New York to escape the war. In 
publishing so much French material, de Zayas’ activities resembled those of Walter 
Arensberg, who had already collected Duchamp, Gleizes, Crotti and others for his 
salon at 33 West 67th Street. De Zayas seems to have hoped he could draw members of 
the Apollinaire circle to the Moder Gallery, in the form of their work, if not as people, 


while the Parisian art and literary markets were still in depression.344 


Despite de Zayas’ considerable promotional efforts, both through 291 and in the 
form of newspaper advertisements, the Modern Gallery was not a great success in 
commercial terms. Although its exhibitions were consistently reviewed in newspapers 
and art magazines, there were few paying customers, and de Zayas soon proved 
himself no better a vendor of modem art than Stieglitz. In his memoir of these years de 


Zayas wrote: 


Soon I found that ‘pictures do not sell themselves’ was only too true, and that I 
did not have the qualities of a salesman. Fortunately, the Modem gallery did | 
not depend on sales for existence. Eugene Meyers [sic], Jr. had provided for it 
with the conviction that there would be no retums, and he was not to be 
disappointed. The commercial side of the Modem Gallery was therefore very 
negligible. In the three years of its existence there were only two buyers, Arthur 
B. Davies who knew all there was to be known about buying pictures, and 


John Quinn who just bought and bought.345

When the gallery closed in 1918, Walter Arensberg bought up some of the remaining 
stock. It is hard not to come to the conclusion that de Zayas, driven by his own 
enthusiasm, had misread events rather badly. Despite the widespread American interest 
in modern art, the public was not, in fact, ready for a European art invasion that could 
support itself commercially. America and the modem artist were, apparently, not very 
much alike after all, and not ready for a “marriage.” The Modem Gallery was, 
however, successful on some of the same terms that “291” had been, something that 
was just as important as commercial success for de Zayas and the others. It soon 
became a place much like “291,” where de Zayas made efforts to show the public the 
best of the modern movement, and where artists came to talk to each other and catch up 
on the latest ideas. What emerged from all the preparation, however, was not quite 
what had been heralded by 291 magazine.

Notes 


1. This is the assumption that lies in back of Willard Bohn’s often insightful account in 
“Guillaume Apollinaire and the New York Avant-Garde,” Comparative Literature 
Studies 13 (March 1976), 40-50; and Apollinaire and the Faceless Man: The Creation 
and Evolution of a Moder Motif (London and Toronto: Associated University Press, 
1991),132-34. Bohn says of the magazine: “On the most general level de Zayas 
adopted as his guidelines such Apollinairian aesthetic principles as modemism, 
spontaneity, and surprise - principles which played an important role in what 
Apollinaire was later to name ‘surréalisme.’ Language, form, and content in 29] all 
reflect these preoccupations and reveal a determined effort to apply them as principles.” 
Bohn, “Guillaume Apollinaire,” 43. The first issue of 291 magazine itself was made up 
of one large sheet of paper that folded out to form six pages. Later issues all contained 
four pages. Subscriptions to the monthly were five dollars per annum, while single 
issues sold for one dollar. Single copies of back issues were later available at ten cents 
each. 


2. This is, of course, most true of the numerous biographies and other books and 
articles on Picabia. See, for example: William A. Camfield, Francis Picabia: His Art 
Life and Times (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979), 77-87; Camfield, “The 
Machinist Style of Francis Picabia,” Art Bulletin 48 (1966), 309-22; Maria L. Borras, 
Picabia (New York: Rizzoli, 1985), 154-56. 


3. This is the perspective taken by Dickran Tashjian in Skyscraper Primitives: Dada and 
the American Avant-Garde 1910-1925 (Middleton, Conn. Wesleyan University Press, 
1975), 29-48; also that work which deals specifically with the influence of Picabia on 
American art. For example, Barbara Zabel “The Machine as Metaphor, Model, and 
Microcosm: Technology in American Art, 1915-1930,” Arts Magazine 57, no.4 
(December 1982), 100-05; and Camfield, Picabia, 106-09. 


4, The worst offender here is Tashjian, Skyscraper Primitives, 29-48. Also: Krzysztof 
Fijalkowski, “Dada and the Machine,” Joumal of European Studies 17 (1987): 239- 
240. This interpretation has its origins in accounts by individuals active in the Dada 
movement: Gabrielle Buffet-Picabia, “Some Memories of Pre-Dada: Picabia and 
Duchamp,” in Dada Painters and Poets, ed. Robert Motherwell (New York: 
Wittenborn, Schultz Inc., 1951), 257-58, 261; Hans Richter, Dada: Art and Anti-Art 
(London: Thames and Hudson, 1965), 84. For another discussion of 291 magazine see 
Ileana Leavens, From 291 to Zurich: The Birth of Dada (Ann Arbor: UMI Research 
Press, 1983), 125-139. 


5. On July 24, 1915, Stieglitz wrote to Agnes Meyer: “It is too bad I could not stay 
over as there was much I wanted to say about many things not pertaining to 291 - the 
publication. - It was after 8:30 when I reached ----. De Z. and I stood at 125th St. and 
Madison Ave. over an hour discussing the seemingly endless topic.” Few details were, 
however, provided in the letter. Alfred Stieglitz to Agnes Meyer, 24 July 1915, Agnes 
Meyer Papers, Manuscript Division, Library of Congress, Washington , D.C.

“Introducing 291,” 291 (New York: Amo Press, 1972). Each version of Norman’s 
accounts of her “Conversations” with Stieglitz is slightly different from the others. The 
conversations recorded took place in the late 1920s and early 1930s. They are 
preserved in the form of typewritten manuscripts in ASA.

13. Marius de Zayas to Agnes Meyer, 15 July 1915, AMP. This letter is discussed in 
greater detail below. 


14. That 291 magazine was a vehicle by which the de Zayas-Meyer faction at “291” 
attempted to make their views known has been noted. See Timothy Rodgers, “False 
Memories: Alfred Stieglitz and the Development of the Nationalist Aesthetic,” in Over 
Here: Modernism, The First Exile 1914-1919, ed. Kermit Champa (Providence: David 
Winton Bell Gallery, 1989), 63-64; William Innes Homer, Alfred Stieglitz and the 
American Avant-Garde (Boston: New York Graphic Society, 1977), 190-94; and 
Leavens ‘291’ to Zurich, 130-33. No attempt has been made, however, to look closely 
at the “promotional” aspects of the magazine. 


15. Stieglitz was never very consistent in his anti-commercial stance. Roger Piatt Hull 
notes that “Stieglitz oversaw the layout of the advertising [in Camera Work], and when 
advertisers did not submit ready-designed material, composed much of it himself.” He 
also notes that “Stieglitz rarely endorsed specific products, but it was emphasised that 
an advertisement in Camera Work was in good company.” Roger Piatt Hull in “Camera 
Work, An American Quarterly” (Ph.D. diss., Northwestern University, 1970), 37-38. 


16. Agnes Meyer to Charles Freer, 4 March 1915, AMP. 


17. Estera Milman notes with respect to 291 and other avant-garde publications that “in 
the final analysis, the avant-garde’s recurrent interaction with the text served as a means 
by which the myth of the avant-garde was strengthened; it was through such interaction 
that they maintained their most pervasive fiction, the myth of functionality.” Estera 
Milman, “The Text and the Myth of the Avant-Garde,” Visible Language 21, nos. 3-4 
(1987), 337. 


18. There is evidence of this in Katherine Rhoades’ many letters to Stieglitz from this 


time. See for example, Katherine Rhoades to Alfred Stieglitz, 26 April 1915, ASA: 
“It’s the subjectivity - of us all - the introspection - the hypercriticalness - or anything

that “291” show both Picasso’s and Picabia’s work. Picasso, he wrote “represents in 
his work the expression of pure sensibility, the action of matter on the senses and also 
of the senses on matter while Picabia’s work is the expression of pure thought. Picasso 
could never work without dealing with objectivity while Picabia forgets matter to 
express only, maybe the memory of something that has happened. One expresses the 
object the other the action.” Marius de Zayas to Alfred Stieglitz, 30 June 1915, ASA.

40.Agnes Meyer, “How Versus Why,” 291 1 (March 1915), 2. Meyer had not been

untrammelled mind.” Ibid. 
46. The article, I suspect, may also have held a personal importance for Meyer. Its 


assertive, no nonsense attitude would have identified her as someone who should be 
taken seriously in the “291” group and in the New York art world. The objective,

“scientific” standards in criticism advocated would also have been gender neutral and 
recall her earlier interest in mathematics, a subject she enjoyed “because the rules of the 
game were precise and failure to play it correctly could be checked with exactitude.”

48. “How Versus Why” also provided a further answer, from the perspective of a 
“scientific” art, to the charges that John Weichsel had recently laid against the modem 
movement 


49. Paul B. Haviland, “291,” 291 1 (March 1915). 4. The article does not have a title 
but is identified as “291” in the Amo Press reprint of 291. Like “How Versus Why,” 
this piece may also be an expression of group opinions. 


50. Ibid. The use of the word “machine” to describe “291” may have some 
significance. 


51. Ibid. 


52. Ibid. The reference is to: Eduard Steichen, “291,” Camera Work 47 (July 1914, 
published January, 1915), 65. Steichen also contributed a drawing to 291 No. 1 (page 
6) entitled “What is Rotten in the State of Denmark” that probably also refers to the 
current state of affairs at the gallery. It forms another part of the critique of Stieglitz 
undertaken in the issue. 


53.”Satirism and Satyrism,” “Simultanism,” “Matisse and New York,” 291 1 (March 
1915), 5. The authors of these articles are not known but they may have been written 
by Paul Haviland, who was also responsible for many of the exhibition “Notes” in 
Camera Work. Publication of this kind of material was also another way of 
circumventing the professional critics.

59. This article is also interesting because of what it says about “291” opinions of 
Katherine Rhoades and Marion Beckett, the two women members of the circle 
exhibited. According to the article, certain members of the “public” were offended by 
the “naturalistic character” of the art on display and thought “that the sanctuary of the 
mystery of abstract art” had been “profaned.” These people, however, had missed the 
point of the exhibition, which was to allow the public to contribute towards the artist’s 
own development. The article, I believe, has the effect of situating Rhoades and Beckett 
between the “public” and the “inside” at “291.” It is also evidence that certain

individuals at “291” were uncomfortable with the association of the gallery with this 
work, the whereabouts of most of which is, incidentally, unknown.

61. “Simultanism,” 5. 


62. In his article for Les Soirées de Paris, Apollinaire identified Picasso as one of the

been at its physical centre. This point is made in Bohn, “Guillaume Apollinaire,” 47. 
The bias against printed Simultanism in the article may be the result of a selective 
paraphrase of Apollinaire’s original. 


64. Apollinaire said of simultanist works that they could be taken in “comme un chef 
d’orchestre lit d’un seul coup les notes superposéés dans la partition, comme on voit 
d’un seul coup les éléments plastiques et imprimés d’une affiche.” (“as a conductor 
reads at a single glance the notes superposed on a score, or as one sees all at once the 
plastic elements and print of a poster.”) [my translation] Apollinaire, “Simultanisme- 
Librettisme,” 324. 


65. “Simultanism,” 5. Roger Shattuck writes about the ambiguity in Apollinaire’s 
longer poetry: “Apollinaire’s ‘lack of identity,’ which sought a new self through a 
simultanist identification with the universe, takes on its true aspect as a reversal of 
consciousness. This huge ambition was to him the most natural thing in the world. 
Through the sequence of important long poems...he increasingly sought himself 
outside himself. It is as if his J were the exterior world from which, once he had 
radiated himself into it, he could look back wistfully and indulgently upon his old self 
as a pathetic object.” [Shattuck’s italics.] Roger Shattuck, The Banquet Years (London: 
Jonathan Cape, 1968), 215-16. This is of course a far cry from naturalistic description. 


66. The etching resembles works identified as having been exhibited at “291” in 1914- 
15 by de Zayas, “How, When, and Why,” 102.

Faceless Man, 144.

74. Meyer Schapiro, in an article written some time ago, noted that the audience for 
modem art was, in fact, largely made up of women. “Women...were among the chief 
friends of the new art, buying painting and sculpture with a generous hand. Art as a 
realm of finesse above the crudities of power appealed to the imaginative, idealistic 
wives and daughters of magnates occupied with their personal fortunes. But what is in 
question here is not simply the quicker disposition of American women to the arts, but 
their response to novel forms. At this moment of general stirring of ideas of 
emancipation, women were especially open to manifestations of freedom within the 
arts.” Meyer Schapiro, “Rebellion in Art,” in America in Crisis (New York: Alfred A. 
Knopf, 1952), 228. In her autobiography, Agnes Meyer wrote: “When Stieglitz 
launched his humorous thrusts at the sterile teaching of the art schools, I found my 
antagonisms toward the equally conventional atmosphere of my college days explained 
and justified. I felt at 291 that my sails were filled by the free air I craved.” Meyer, Out_ 


of These Roots, 68.

Critics, 1916-1929 (Ann Arbor: UMI Research Press, 1989), 28-31. She notes that 
“The women in his dreams mirrored female stereotypes, both good and evil, that had 
reigned in Wester art and literature for centuries.” Probably not coincidentally, the 
juxtaposition of items by Stieglitz and Apollinaire once again linked the “leaders” of the 
American and French avant-gardes.

90. 291 magazine also met with the disapproval of long time “291” associate, Sadakichi 
Hartmann, who wrote to Stieglitz: “I just read ‘291’ for the first and last time....I must 
confess I never expected to see such an accumulation of balderdash, rodomontade, 
gallimaufry, salimagundi and ‘I scratch you on the back if you tickle me’ rant and 
prattle under one cover. Das sind ja keine Blauer Reiter!” Sadakichi Hartmann to Alfred 
Stieglitz, 20 May 1915, ASA. Stieglitz replied with a letter that effectively ostracised 
him from the “291” circle. Alfred Stieglitz to Sadakichi Hartmann, 25 May 1915, ASA.

these points with respect to “Mental Reactions,” in Faceless Man, 133-34. 


97. Katherine Rhoades, “I walked into a moment of greatness...”; Agnes Meyer, 
“Woman,” 291 3 (May 1915), 2-3. The page on which these poems are laid out is a 
version of a “caricature” of Rhoades by de Zayas. See Douglas Hyland, Marius de 
Zayas: Conjurer of Souls (Lawrence, Kansas: Spencer Museum of Art, 1981), 120-21.

291 9 (November 1915), 2. 


100. This adaptation of simultanism reveals the influence of de Zayas’ scientific 
philosophy of art. In his criticism he had consistently maintained that art must have as 
an object something in the “real” world, preferably the “Form” that was its essence. De 
Zayas’ bias in favour of the knowable may thus have helped to put a positivist slant on 
a medium that was already oriented toward the objective. 


101. This element in these works also shows the influence of de Zayas’ caricature, 
which was almost exclusively made up of portraits of individuals. This point is made in 
Francis Naumann, “Introduction,” in de Zayas, “How, When, and Why,” 97. De 
Zayas referred to his Simultanist works as “Psychotype.” 


102. De Zayas and Meyer, “Mental Reactions,” 3. 


103. Willard Bohn makes this point in Willard Bohn, “Marius de Zayas and Visual 
Poetry: ‘Mental Reactions,’” Arts Magazine 55, no. 10 (June 1981), 4-7. It should be 
noted that the abstract, visual elements of the poem complicate the poem considerably. I 
do not agree with Bohn’s interpretation of them in the aforementioned article. 


104. Compare, for example, Apollinaire’s “Lettre-Océan,” which combines such 
mundane details as sirens, gramophones, shoes and bits of conversation with political 
slogans and the Eiffel tower transmitting messages to form “a telegraphic letter 
connecting the author with his brother Albert in Mexico.” See Willard Bohn, The_ 


Aesthetics of Visual Poetry, 1914-1928 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 
1986), 17-24. 


105. I do not want to suggest that everything in the magazine is bland. These examples 
appear together with much that is very strange indeed. For example Savinio’s evocation 
of Verdi in his manifesto in No.4: 


GIUSEPPE VERDI: forme douce et terrible...enrubanné de lanicres 
polychromes. Animal d’etrange fidelite. Ses poumons en papiers rouge vif se 
détachaient presque du thorax ainsi que les nageoires du poisson-hirondelle,-

107. Kerfoot, “Bunch,” 4. 
108. In its wry comment on the conditions of a well-off existence it resembles the 


cartoons that de Zayas produced for Puck. Compare, for example, de Zayas, “She 
“Worked’ Him For a Car,” Puck 2 January 1915. 


109. De Zayas and Meyer, “Mental Reactions,” 3. The poem is discussed in Bohn, 
“Marius de Zayas and Visual Poetry,” 4-7; Bohn, Visual Poetry, 185-203. Neither of 
these is very satisfactory. 


110. In his poem “Le Musicien de Saint-Merry,” Apollinaire suggested that poets make 
use of perfume labels. See note 96. 


111. “The Academy,” 291 2 (April 1915), 1.

“Prometheus” Symphony had received its world premiere at Carnegie Hall on March 
20, 1915. The fact that the symphony was scored for orchestra and coloured lights 
made it especially interesting for the editors of 291. See James M. Baker, __ 
“<Prometheus’ in America: The Significance of the World Premiere of Scriabin’s ‘Poem 
of Fire’ as Color-Music, New York, 20 March 1915,” in Over Here: Modernism, The

114. See note 94. 


115. Kermit Champa notes: “Music was the moder rage in urban America, as much so 
as in France or England - nearly as much so as in Germany.... The power that music 
possessed in the American cultural marketplace would ultimately provide a confidence 
model for the introduction and practice of post-impressionist art in America.” Kermit

Virgin” in Over Here: Modernism, The First Exile 1914-1919, ed. Kermit Champa

116. In these early issues of 291, two poems by Katherine Rhoades also dealt with the 
subject of music: Rhoades, “I Walked Into a Moment of Greatness...,” 291 3 (May 
1915), 2-3; Rhoades, “Flip-Flap,” 291 4 (June 1915), 3. 


117. “Motherhood a Crime,” 291 2 (April 1915), 1; “Maternity,” 291 3 (May 1915), 4. 
118. “Motherhood a Crime,” 1. 
119. “Thumbs Down,” 291 2 (April 1915), 1. 


120. Compare, of course, Marinetti’s “The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism,” 
which culminated in the description of a serious automobile accident. 


121. “Modem Music,” 1. The actual comparison with Savinio was made by means of a 
juxtaposition with the similarly titled article, “New Music,” which described and 
praised the Italian composer’s compositions. Savinio’s music seems to have been a 
form of simultanism in that he incorporated into his pieces scraps of other music and 
noises of various kinds, and because their structure was based on drawings. The 
literature on Savinio is very limited and recordings of his music impossible to find. 


122. “Watch Their Steps,” 291 3 (May 1915), 4. 
123. Ibid. 


124, Ibid. The reference is to the squeaking of the new shoes of the poet in “Lettre- 
Ocean.” 


125. This is, of course, an example of what Pierre Bourdieu calls “aesthetic 
distancing”: “The aesthete...whenever he appropriates one of the objects of popular 
tastes (eg. Westerns or strip cartoons), introduces a distance, a gap - the measure of his 
distant distinction - vis-a-vis ‘first degree’ perception, by displacing interest from the 
‘content,’ characters, plot, etc., to the form, to the specifically artistic effects which are 
only appreciated relationally, through a comparison with other works which is 
incompatible with immersion in the singularity of the work immediately given.” Pierre 
Bourdieu, Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste, trans. Richard Nice 
(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1984), 34. I would also consider this 
article an example of the “feminisation” of mass culture described by Andreas Huyssen 
in “Mass Culture as Woman: Modermism’s Other,” in Studies in Entertainment: Critical 
Approaches to Mass Culture, ed. Tania Modleski (Bloomington: Indiana University 
Press), 188-207.

139. The best account of Picabia’s stay in New York is in Camfield, Picabia, 71-90. 
Late in 1915 Picabia made a very brief trip to either Cuba or Panama in order to fulfil 
his obligations to the French government.

were taken, intact or slightly altered, from the pink pages of the Petit Larousse 
dictionary. Borras, Picabia, 155. 


143. Inscriptions had already appeared on Picabia’s abstract canvases, but not as such 
integrated and integral parts of the work. 

144, I have been convinced by William Innes Homer’s argument that the “Jeune fille 
Américaine dans ]’état de nudité” is, in fact, Agnes Meyer. Her presence here rounds 
out the group portrait of the five “insiders” at “291.” William Innes Homer, “Picabia’s 
‘Jeune américaine dans 1’état de nudité’ and Her Friends,” Art Bulletin 56, no. 1 
(March 1975), 110-115.

152. Gabrielle-Buffet Picabia, who joined her husband in New York in September or 
October of 1915, wrote about this period: “No sooner had we arrived than we became a 
part of a motley international band which tumed night into day, conscientious objectors 
of all nationalities and walks of life living in an unconceivable orgy of sexuality, jazz, 
and alcohol. Scarcely escaped from the vice of martial law, we believed at first that we 
had returned to the blessed times of complete thought and action.” Buffet-Picabia, 
“Some Memories,” 259. She also recalled that their first impressions were quickly 
dispelled. 


153. This point has been convincingly argued in Camfield, Francis Picabia, 77-78; and 
Camfield, “Machanist Style,” 313-14. 


154. Although the sparkplug is probably a portrait of Agnes Meyer, it also constitutes a 
comment by Picabia on all American “girls.” In his novel, Caravanserail, Picabia later 
wrote: “But the magnificent body of the American woman, who plays golf, dances, 
swims, drives a car, but doesn’t know how to make love - that’s why they invented 
flirtation.” Quoted in Bohn, “Abstract Vision,” 450. For an interpretation see Tashjian, 


Skyscraper Primitives, 38. 


155. “New York, at first, did not see...” has not been adequately discussed, but see: 
Tashjian, Skyscraper Primitives, 40-43. According to Tashjian, de Zayas “claimed that 
given the conditions of rapid cultural and social change, history in America had become 
meaningless, so that the American artist ought to forget history - the traditions out of 
which European art was derived - and create his own indigenous art. But American art 
could not exist because of the peculiar cultural and social flux, the results of creation

had necessarily to be either anti-art or non-art.” Tashjian ignores de Zayas’ deep 
commitment, expressed in this essay and elsewhere, to the importance of art as it was 
“traditionally” conceived. 


156. De Zayas, “New York,” 6. 


157. Ibid. That American “gentility” and concern with things European had precluded 
“contact” with American realities was a common complaint in the period. Among more 
important examples are: George Santayana, “The Genteel Tradition in American 
Philosophy,” Winds of Doctrine (New York: Charles Scribners Sons, 1913.), 186- 
215; Van Wyck Brooks, America’s Coming of Age (New York: Huebsch, 1914); 
Romain Rolland, “America and the Arts,” Seven Arts (November 1916), 47; Robert J. 
Coady, “American Art,” The Soil 1, no. 1 (December 1916), 3-4,; Waldo Frank, Our 
America (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919; William Carlos Williams, “Contact,” 
Contact 1 (December 1920), 1; Paul Rosenfeld, Port of New York, (New York: 
Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1924). Not all these writers were as enthusiastic as de 
Zayas about the machine and its effects. For discussions of this trend: Dickran 
Tashjian, William Carlos Williams and the American Scene 1920-1940 (New York: 
Whitney Museum of American Art, 1978), 14-73; Lisa M. Steinman, Made in America 
(New Haven: Yale University Press, 1987), 17-34; Matthew Baigell, “American Art 
and National Identity: The 1920s,” Arts Magazine 61, no. 6 (February 1987), 48-55;

strongly in evidence until after World War I. Rodgers, “False Memories,” 59-66. 


167. De Zayas’ Modem Gallery, which opened on October 7, 1915, also showed 
relatively little American art until 1917. See list of exhibitions at Modem Gallery in Eva

Especially revealing is Marius de Zayas to Alfred Stieglitz, 16 August 1915, ASA, 
which states: “We sent to Paris 60 copies of the last two numbers to people who have a 
real interest in modem art.” The fashionable magazine Smart Set, which was intended 
for American readers, also ran a monthly column in French. “Whether these stories 
were widely read is not clear, but this French connection also tended to bring the 
magazine contributions from other European writers, not only French, but sophisticated 
European emigrants recently arrived in America, and other established authors who 
previously had no outlets in America.” George H. Douglas, The Smart Magazines 
(Hamden, Conn.: Archon Books, 1991), 20.

Representations of Women and Suffrage Imagery in The Masses, 1913-1917,” (MA 
thesis, University of Alberta, 1991), 56-67. Sawin comments: “[Duncan] was 
Walkowitz’s exact contemporary and her equation of bodily expression with purity of 
spirit parallelled his own ideas about artistic freedom: unhampered spontaneity was 
pure, it was creative and therefore it could not fail to be art.” Some very similar 
drawings of Walkowitz’s drawings of Duncan, who gave a performance in New York 
in 1915, were later published in the socialist magazine, The Masses. 


202. Very little information on this issue is provided by letters. It is probably the 
“Walkowitz number” referred to in Marius de Zayas to Agnes Meyer, 15 July 1915, 
AMP. For an unspecified reason the number had “brought another crisis at 291,” that 
called their “future as a group” into question. From this evidence, I assume that the 
issue was to have appeared in July, but was replaced by the Picabia double issue, Nos. 
5/6 (July-August, 1915).

209. Appearance of sexually explicit material with an avant-garde twist in 291 has a 
quite close parallel in the publication of Mina Loy’s “Love Songs” by Arthur 
Kreymborg’s literary magazine Others. About these poems, a sort of sexually explicit 
high modemism in which a woman bared her innermost thoughts, Kreymborg later 
recalled: 


In an unsophisticated land, such sophistry, clinical frankness, sardonic 
conclusions, wedded to a madly elliptical style...horrified our gentry and drove 
our critics into nervous despair. The nudity of emotion and thought roused the 
worst disturbance, and the utter nonchalance in revealing the secrets of sex was 
denounced as no less than lewd.” Arthur Kreymborg, Our Singing Strength. 
Quoted in Roger L. Conover, “Introduction” in Mina Loy, The Last Lunar 
Baedeker, ed. R. Conover (Highlands: The Jargon Society, 1982), xxxvi- 
XXXVii. 


The second poem, the subject of which is male “genius” seen from a woman’s point of 
view, has much in common with Meyer’s “Mental Reactions.” The man in Loy’s poem 
is 


The skin sack 
In which a wanton duality 
Packed 
All the completions of my infructuous impulses 
Something the shape of a man... 
My fingertips are numb from fretting your hair 
A God’s doormat 

On the threshold of your mind. 


The poems are also similar in that they seem both to have come out of their author’s 
experiences with an artistic avant-garde, in Loy’s case with Marinetti and the Futurists. 
Unlike “Mental Reactions,” however, the “Love Poems” caused quite a sensation, and 
made Others known in New York and elsewhere. Publication of similar work 
nevertheless demonstrates considerable prescience on the part of the editors of 291. On 
Mina Loy and the Futurists: Carolyn Burke, “Becoming Mina Loy,” Women’s Studies 
7 (1980), 140-48.

218. The presence of European style erotic material in 291 was, I believe, also a means 
of “sexing” America for the benefit of Americans and Europeans alike. Both at home 
and abroad, American culture was thought rather genteel and staid, an impression that 
the editors of 291 must have felt it desirable to correct. 


219. Guillaume Apollinaire, The Cubist Painters, trans. Lionel Abel (New York:

period. See, for example, Gabrielle Buffet’s description of pre-war activity: “We were 
convinced of the arbitrariness and falsity of our poor creation, the world. And yet, in 
our striving for a new gestation, we were none the less compelled to seek a new 
arbitrary principle, which we had to manufacture out of the whole cloth, with no other 
tools but trust - to chance or intuition.” Buffet-Picabia, “Some Memories,” 255.

its influence, but does not provide great insight into its themes.

227. Savinio was obsessed by some of these same themes. His dramatic poem, Les" 
Chants de la mi-mort, published in Les Soirées de Paris in the J uly-August 1914 issue, 
“dramatizes a whole series of themes generated by problems associated with sexuality. 
These include: the father’s jealousy, which mirrors the mother’s and leads him to 
denounce the son; the father’s conspicuous voyeurism, which is related to the theme of 
repressed sexuality; the son’s vengeance directed against his parents, which alternates 
with his love for them; and the conflict between sexual satisfaction and society’s 
approval.” Ibid, 83.

231. Katherine Rhoades, untitled drawing, 291 2 (April 1915), 2. The literature on 
Rhoades is very limited. There is a short biographical note in: Homer, Alfred Stieglitz, 
313. Several hundred of the letters she wrote to Stieglitz between 1913 and 1917 are 
preserved in the Alfred Stieglitz Archive, Beinecke Library, New Haven, Conn. 
Rhoades’ handwriting is, unfortunately, almost illegible. Most of her paintings have 
been destroyed. 


232. This, at least, is the conclusion I draw from the letters noted above. Stieglitz’s 
letters to Rhoades do not survive and were probably destroyed by Rhoades herself. 


233. Hyland, Conjurer of Souls, 122. See also: Craig R, Bailey, “The Art of Marius de 
Zayas,” Arts Magazine 53, no. 1 (September 1978), 42. Tur the Rhoades drawing 
sideways and it looks like a gun. 


234. The poem is discussed in: Bohn, Visual Poetry, 185-203; Bohn, “Marius de 
Zayas and Visual Poetry,” 4-7; Tashjian, Skyscraper Primitives, 33-34. Bohn believes 
that the abstract elements of the work can be interpreted as a lighthouse and moth, 
representing the man and woman respectively. His reading of “Mental Reactions” in 
Visual Poetry is quite convincing, but is marred by the assumption that the woman in 
the poem is Agnes Meyer herself, and by a failure to take into account its feminist 
elements. 


235. The poem was probably influenced by Meyer’s experiences in artistic circles in 
Europe and the United States. Meyer, who enjoyed flirting with men, could, however, 
more than hold her own in these encounters. The use of women by men as 
“introductions to themselves” was very common in intellectual and bohemian circles, 
and even formed the basis of a considerable amount of literature. See Trimberger, 
“Feminism, Men, and Modern Love,” 131-149; Humphrey, Children of Fantasy, 221- 
26. In 1920 Floyd Dell, bohemian arch-lover, observed that “ men are interested in 
themselves - in their own reactions to women - much more than in the women.” Floyd 
Dell, Homecoming: An Autobiography (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1924), 240.

236. Compare again Mina Loy’s “Love Songs” about which Carolyn Burke writes: 
“This passionately clinical analysis of a failed love affair from the woman’s perspective 
shocked readers because it violated the thematic and formal conventions for poetic 
speech by women. Steinian in her extreme abandonment of punctuation, connectives, 
and familiar syntactic structures, Loy arranged her phrases with a painter’s eye for their 
shapes on the page and a post-Bergsonian sense of experience as a fragmented process 
reflected in the speakers’s consciousness.” Burke identifies this as a specifically 
feminist project. Carolyn Burke, “Without Commas: Gertrude Stein and Mina Loy,” 
Poetics Journal 4 (May 1984), 50. 


237. De Zayas and Meyer, “Mental Reactions,” 3. 

238. Dickran Tashjian notes a similarity between the woman in the poem and the 
protagonist of T. S. Eliot’s “The Lovesong of Alfred J. Prufrock,” a poem that was 
published in the same year. Tashjian, Skyscraper Primitives, 34. 

239. De Zayas and Meyer, “Mental Reactions,” 3. 

240. Ibid. The reference to an “experiment” suggests that the poem describes an 
encounter that took place in the Stieglitz circle, a place where “experiments” of an 
artistic nature were also carried out. 

241. I would speculate that “Mental Reactions” and other writing by women in 291 
was, in fact, published with a female readership in mind. A large number of the 
habitues of “291,” and other artistic and bohemian coteries where the magazine was 


read, were women, many of whom would have had experiences similar to that of the 
woman in the poem.

discussed in: Tashjian, Skyscraper Primitives, 36-37. The opera Rhoades attended, 
Wagner’s “Die Meistersinger von Nuremberg,” is, of course, about a competition 
between male singers, the winner of which gets the girl.

251. Ibid. These words, “stifled,” “repression,” would seem to have Freudian 
overtones. 


252. In his letter on the “situation” at “291” dated July 15, 1915, shortly after Meyer 
had had her child, de Zayas wrote: “I suppose you are now giving your attention to 
something far more important than Art and its evolution.” Nevertheless, he informed 
her at length about his thoughts on “291.” 


253. There are fewer letters from Rhoades to Stieglitz in ASA after August, 1915. 


254, De Zayas appears to have become the controlling force in 291 during the summer 
of 1915. On July 24, 1915 Stieglitz wrote to Meyer, probably with reference to 291: 
“Just at present the most important thing is to give De Zayas a full chance. He is entitled 
to it and I believe in what he is doing. - As for the gallery it will be taken care of as 
occasion warrants.” Alfred Stieglitz to Agnes Meyer, 24 July 1915, AMP. 


255. This was, of course, the period in which Ezra Pound was attempting to take 
control of literary magazines, many of them edited by women, of which he was 
contributing editor. 


256. Katherine Rhoades to Alfred Stieglitz, 10 July 1915, ASA. 
257. Katherine Rhoades to Alfred Stieglitz, 30 July 1915, ASA. 


258. Ibid. In this letter Rhoades offered a sort of parody of the inscriptions on the 
drawings to explain what they meant to her, She also declared herself opposed to 
Picabia’s version of “science”: “Why should living with and learning from seeds and 
plants - watching them grow and blossom, make the science expression [sic] of our life 
or thought, seem lacking in the natural element of life? It shouldn’t be so - that’s why I 
wonder if it is science?” 


259. For male artists and writers the whole avant-garde project was usually coded as 
hard and masculine, with the soft, sentimental “feminine” as its undesirable other. See

262. By inducting the makers of machines into the ranks of artists, Picabia was able to 
annex vast fields of science and engineering to his own specialty. 


263. Myths of male autogenesis have a long history in European culture, going back to 
the birth of Athena from the head of Zeus and Eve from Adams rib. In the nineteenth 
century the machine was incorporated into these myths, from whence they entered 
twentieth century avant-garde mythology. Andreas Huyssen writes, with reference to 
Rotwang’s creation of the female robot, Maria, in Fritz Lang’s film Metropolis: “...as 
soon as the machine came to be perceived as a demonic, inexplicable threat and as the 
harbinger of chaos and destruction...writers began to imagine the Maschinenmenschen 
as woman. There are grounds to suspect that we are facing here a complex process of 
projection and displacement. The fears and perceptual anxieties emanating from ever 
more powerful machines are recast and reconstructed in terms of the male fear of female 
sexuality, reflecting, in the Freudian account, the male’s castration anxiety.” Huyssen 
notes that the robot is “not just any life, but woman herself, the epitome of nature. The 
nature/culture split seems healed. The most complete technologization of nature appears 
as renaturalisation, as a process back to nature. Man is at long last alone and at one with 
himself.” Andreas Huyssen, “The Vamp and the Machine: Technology and Sexuality in 
Fritz Lang’s Metropolis,” New German Culture 24-25 (Fall-Winter 1981-82), 221- 
237. 1 would speculate that the presence of similar creatures in 291 magazine also 
betrays a fear of the business culture that brought machinery into being, and that they 
function as fetishes in this context as well. 


264. Tashjian, Skyscraper Primitives, 38. 


265. In the United States this sort of masculinisation of modem artistic endeavour was 
hardly unique to the Stieglitz circle. Arthur Jerome Eddy in Cubists and Post- 
Impressionists and Willard (1914) Huntington Wright in Modern Painting (1915) 
similarly made distinctions between avant-garde embodiments of virility and imitative, 
decorative feminine styles. “For Americans concerned with the advancement and __ 
promotion of the visual arts at the time, there was a built in insecurity factor, something 
for which they were inclined to compensate with assertions of masculinity.” These 
points are made in Anger and Brenneman, “Music and the Aesthetic of Masculine 
Order,” 78-89.

271. In the course of his argument, de Zayas condemns the use of “shields” in the 
artist’s metaphoric union with America, thus identifying himself with the reactionary 
side in the birth control debate. Such an appropriation would seem to be in 
contradiction to the earlier advocacy of women’s reproductive rights in the magazine 
(ie.: “Motherhood a Crime”). De Zayas’ use of this metaphor in the essay suggests that 
these earlier articles were, in fact, published mainly with their publicity value in mind.

274. Ibid. At other times, however, de Zayas apparently did call it “rape.” Rodrigo de 
Zayas told Leslie Cohen in 1971 that his father had referred to the education of the 
public as “the rape of the American consciousness.” Leslie Cohen, “Marius de Zayas 
and the Modern Art Movement in New York” (MA thesis, Queen’s College, City 
University of New York, 1973), 3. In 1916 Picabia wrote from Barcelona: “The 
intellectuals here are cold-blooded, they prefer onanism to rape....” Quoted in Borras,

278. Stieglitz always encouraged his associates to be “frank” with him, and the word 
was used frequently in their correspondence. After he broke with Meyer and de Zayas 
in late 1915 or early 1916, however, he wrote to Meyer: “I regret deeply that both you 
and de Zayas should feel that I have not been frank with you. Perhaps too great 
frankness all these years has been the cause of all this mess, for mess it is.” Alfred

“How, When, and Why,” 116-18, which reads, in part: “Most of the French artists had 
become soldiers. It was known that the art market in Paris was practically closed. An 
altruistic spirit invaded the Photo-Secession, inspiring the idea that the ‘modems 
should be helped in some way, most particularly those artists whose work had been 
shown at the Photo Secession for “experimental purposes” only.

297. According to Stieglitz, “The Steerage” played an important role the development 
of his “straight” method of photography. To Dorothy Norman he related how he had 
taken the picture under conditions of great excitement on a trip to Europe in 1907, and 
developed it with much care in Paris the same year. Alfred Stieglitz, “Four 
Happenings,” Twice-A-Year 8-9 (Spring-Summer 1942/Fall-Winter 1942), 127-131. 
Recently, evidence has come to light that suggests Stieglitz fabricated the entire 
incident, and that he actually laid the photograph aside until its quality was pointed out 
to him by Max Weber. See James S. Terry, “The Problem of ‘The Steerage,’” History 
of Photography 6, no. 3 (July 1982), 211-22.

(April-July 1913, published November 1913), 13-14. Ina letter to de Zayas, Stieglitz 

objected to what de Zayas had written about him in 291, even though the opinions 

expressed differed little from what de Zayas had said in his earlier essays. Marius de 

Zayas to Alfred Stieglitz, 17 December 1915, ASA. Stieglitz appears to have felt that de

330. Interestingly, there are also marked resemblances between the alluring yet defiant

in “New York, at first, did not see...”: 


...[Stieglitz] has not succeeded in putting in motion the enormous mass of this 
public’s self-sufficiency. America has not the slightest conception of the value 
of the work accomplished by Stieglitz. Success, and success ona large scale, is 
the only thing that can make an impression on American mentality. Any effort, 
any tendency, which does not possess the radiation of advertising remains 
practically ignored. [my italics] 


Woman and public were both shown to be equally materialistic and self-regarding, and 
thus further associated with one another.

Epilogue 


In spite of de Zayas’ lack of commercial acumen, his activities at the Modern 
Gallery seem to have offended Stieglitz all the same. Late in 1915 or early in 1916 an 
altercation of some kind occurred between de Zayas and Meyer on the one side and 
Stieglitz on the other. The precise reasons for the disagreement were never revealed, 
but the issue in question seems to have been the conduct of business at the Modern 
Gallery.! Stieglitz set out a version of his view of the matter in a series of photographs 
and articles published in the October, 1916 issue of Camera Work, the first to appear in 
almost two years. At the back of the issue he included five items that seem designed to 
tell his side of the story: 1) a short note on 291 magazine, probably written by de 
Zayas, 2) a reprint of the unreleased Modem Gallery announcement, 3) a series of very 
beautiful photographs of exhibitions at “291,” dating from 1906 through 1915, 4) a 
reprint of de Zayas’ essay “New York, at first, did not see...,” which had, of course, 
taken Stieglitz thoroughly to task for his supposed failure to introduce modern art to 
America, and, 5) a little poem by Marsden Hartley, entitled “Epitaph for Alfred 
Stieglitz,” that read: 


Question not 

My soul’s demise 

My friends consult 

The query is the answer. 


To my peace.2 
Although publication of this material ostensibly provided readers with an opportunity to 
compare Stieglitz’s work on behalf of modern art with that of de Zayas and his 
associates, the presentation was, in fact, quite slanted towards Stieglitz’s point of view. 
Juxtaposition of de Zayas’ essay and the beautiful photographs of “291” constituted a 
rebuttal in visual terms of de Zayas’ claim that Stieglitz had “failed.” Publication of the 
epitaph seems to have been a piece of false modesty on Stieglitz’s part: since such 
“friends” as de Zayas and Meyer had told him he was “dead,” he must be, even though 


the photographic evidence pointed the other way. The only editorial comment in the

series came at the end of the Modern Gallery announcement, which had, of course, 
linked the new place closely with “291,” and had stated that business there would be 
conducted on terms beneficial to both artists and public. Stieglitz explained that 


Mr. De Zayas, after experimenting for three months on the lines 
contemplated, found that practical business in New York and ‘291’ were 
incompatible. In consequence he suggested that ‘291’ and the Modern gallery 
be separated. The suggestion automatically constituted a separation.3 


These snide remarks implied that de Zayas had engaged in shady business dealings at 
the Modern Gallery, and that he and Meyer had been ostracised for this reason. De 
Zayas seems to have taken Stieglitz’s accusations in stride, perhaps because he partly 
admitted their truth. Agnes Meyer was furious, however, and said as much to de Zayas 
in a strongly worded note: 


After carefully considering Stieglitz’s false version of the separation of 291 and 
the Moder Gallery, we both [she and Eugene] decided that the most dignified 
thing to do is to ignore it altogether....[Stieglitz] always claims that Camera 
Work is a record. It is more a record of himself with all his virtues and all his 
pitiful weakness than of anything else.... The Modern Gallery can stand on its 
own two feet and needs not fear a Stieglitz....To have known S. is very 


beneficial, to let him hang on is sure destruction.4 


Meyer and Stieglitz were not again on friendly terms until the 1940s. 


Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to say what really happened, although a 
few general observations can be offered. One rather banal conclusion that can be drawn 
is that in Stieglitz’s world, where de Zayas had moved for so long, business was 
indeed incompatible with art. The high ethical standards that Stieglitz had so thoroughly 
incorporated into his practice made negotiations concerning the value of a work of art 
virtually impossible, especially when it came to selling works to persons Stieglitz 
thought unsuitable. At “291” Stieglitz seems to have been able either to ignore the 
problems that his high standards created, or to settle them to his own satisfaction. 


However, when de Zayas attempted to find his own way through these same ethical 


dilemmas he was condemned and excluded.5 Interestingly, de Zayas seems soon to

have found that practical business methods were more than he himself could stomach, 
and gave up the aggressive marketing of modem art for a retreat to the high ground 
already occupied by Stieglitz. The “objective” seems, indeed, to have been too 
powerful a force in America to make an approach to it worthwhile. Unlike Stieglitz, 
however, de Zayas had, for a time at least, been willing to respond to the changes 
taking place in the art world, and to admit that the production of art had “commercial” 
aspects that could not completely be ignored. He seems to have realised that Stieglitz’s 
blindness to the importance of practical matters, and his refusal to admit that “291” 
was, in its own way, deeply involved in the promotion of art, were hypocritical and 


ultimately damaging to his cause. 


Early in 1916, about the time of the blowup with de Zayas and Meyer, Stieglitz, 
together with a number of other New York artists and critics, was busy with 
preparations for something called the Forum Exhibition. A large show made up entirely 
of modern work by American artists, it was organised with the intention of countering 
the preponderance of European art then on display in New York, and to serve as an 
alternative space to the for-profit galleries.6 While the work exhibited was for sale, the 
organisers claimed that all the art shown had been given a fair valuation and that it could 
be bought without risk. Stieglitz and his associates on the organising committee 
publicised these contentions widely, but were met with a fair amount of skepticism 
from individuals who maintained that the “commercial” galleries had, in fact, made a 
real contribution to modem art in the United States.7 When the Forum Exhibition 
opened in March of 1916, it was not well attended and not much work was sold. 
Stieglitz, in fact, appears to have participated in the project mainly with the aim of 
countering the forces of commercialism in art. As such, his involvement must, I think, 
be understood as constituting something of a reply not only to the likes of Montross 
and Coady, but also to de Zayas’ activities at the Modem Gallery. Stieglitz seems to 


have tried to show that exhibitions such as this one were the way to fight

commercialism in New York, not by giving in to it. 291 magazine itself folded in 
March of 1916 after twelve issues had appeared. The backers, Stieglitz, Meyer, 
Haviland, and de Zayas, seem to have agreed early in that year that there was little more 
to be said, and that the considerable expense involved was no longer justified.8 
Stieglitz, however, appears to have been the first to withdraw. I would speculate that 
the close connection 291 magazine had formed with “commercialism” at the Modern 


Gallery probably influenced his decision to abandon the project.

Notes 


1. References to the spat in letters are very vague, although the bitterness of feeling is 
unmistakable. De Zayas and Stieglitz were reconciled by the end of 1916, but Stieglitz 
and Meyer were never again on friendly terms. Most commentators agree that the 
dispute had something to do with conduct of business at the Modem Gallery. See: 
Lowe, Stieglitz, 199-200; Leavens, ‘291’ to Zurich, 124-25. In conversation with 
Dorothy Norman, Stieglitz also said that de Zayas had given him to believe that the 
Modem gallery would be devoted only to abstract art, and that most of Stieglitz’s stable 
of artists, including John Marin, would therefore be shut out. Alfred Stieglitz, “Four 
Happenings,” 126-27.

Arrangements at ‘291””; “From ‘291’- July-August Number, 1915”; Marsden Hartley,

Zurich, 124.

Additions (New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1983); Zilczer, “Aesthetic 
Struggle,” 80-91; Tolnick, “Collecting American Modernism,” 53. 


7. Some artists were even pressured to withdraw their work from “commercial” 
venues. See Willard Huntington Wright to John Weichsel, 31 January 1916, Weichsel 
Papers, Archives of American Art. Quoted in Zilczer, “Aesthetic Struggle,” 85. The 
critic for the New York Mail wrote that 


The point made by the committee that the exhibition is free from any 
commercial influence is hardly fair to the dealers who have had the courage to 
show these paintings before the Forum Exhibition Committee was born. 

Without the decried ‘commercial influence’ of Montross and Daniels 
many of these men never would have had a chance to show their work in public 
in New York. “Little Novelty in Forum Exhibit,” New York Mail 11 March 


1916. Quoted in Ibid, 86. 


8. On December 30, Stieglitz wrote to Haviland: “T do not feel as if I could afford the 
luxury of continuing it, and you told me before you left that you certainly could not. If 
Mrs. Meyer is willing to go on assuming the whole responsibility, and de Zayas feels 
like continuing the work why I have no objections, but personally I feel that there will 
be nothing to add.” Alfred Stieglitz to Paul Haviland, 30 December 1915, ASA.

I WALKED IN TO 
A MOMENT OF GRE 
ATNESS. THERE WAS 
A WAVE OF PURE EM 
OTION RUNNING THRO 
UGH THE AIR—LIKE A PU 
LSE RECORDING THE BEAT OF 
SOULS. I STOOD AGAINST A WALL, — 
THE HOUSE WAS IN DARKNESS, LIGHT 
ON THE STAGE, THE LAST ACT OF 
MEISTERSINGER HAD BEGUN. I! LISTENED. 
ALL OF ME HEARD. IF THAT STRAIGHT 
LINE OF TERRIFIC TENSITY WHICH STRETCHED 
CONTINUOUSLY BETWEEN MYSELF AND THE MUSIC, 
GROWING MORE AND MORE SENSITIVE EACH MO 

MENT,—COULD HAVE EXISTED INDEFINITELY UNTIL THE 
LINE BECAME INSEPARABLE WITH THE STATE ABOUT IT— 
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED? 

EVERYTHING HAD MERGED—THERE WAS NO 
POSSIBILITY OF ANY RETENTION OF THE SEPARATENESS OF A HU 
MAN SELF FROM THE SPACE OF SOUND INTO WHICH THAT SENTI 
ENT SELF HAD PROJECTED. AN EXTENSION OF FEELING AND A DIF 
FUSION OF MUSIC WITH IT—CREATING A CONDITION OF ONENESS. A 
PASSING OF EACH INTO THE OTHER. 

SOUND, GIVING, 


WILL, FEELING, 
AN INSISTENT ENTITY REACHED. 
WAS THERE ANY PART OF ME THAT DID NOT RESPOND? 

I WAS NOT A WOMAN—I BECAME MERELY A PART OF THE ATTUNEMENT OF 
THE MOMENT—AS DID ALL THE OTHERS, THE STRANGERS STANDING SO 
NEAR THAT I COULD HAVE TOUCHED THEM—AND I THINK WE WERE TOUCH 
ING. WE HAD DROPPED OUR LITTLE SELVES—WE WERE NOT— BUT 
SOMETHING GREATER THAN OURSELVES WAS BREATHING. WHAT 
GAVE IT THE IMPETUS TO BREATHE? AND IF IT COULD HAVE EN 
DURED—IF A CLIMAX COULD HAVE BEEN REACHED AND HELD 
FOR THE FRACTION OF A SECOND—WOULD NOT THAT I 
NSTANT HAVE BECOME INFINITE? WOULD IT HAVE 
BEEN DEATH? OR ESCAPE—INTO A QUICKEN 
ING OF LIFE?
