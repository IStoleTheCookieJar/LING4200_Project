A  c'ance  at  the  untidy  room  n 
vealed  the  cause.    lie  looked  like 
a  m.-n  of  pluck.  John  did,  and  he 
na>.    Ill-  shop  had  grown  intu

the  little  houxr  in  which  he  eta- 
rnenced  life  as  a  married  man.  fc 
his  business,  and  moved  his  fami- 
ly into  a  little  cottage,  not  quite  a

tow.:  ulked  "I  Juhn  as  a  rising 
m.vn.  but  ihey  shook  their  head* 
at  -  ght  itr  mention  ot  Alice  Boric, 
his  wife.    Alice  had  been  a  little 
beauty  at  eighteen,  and  that  was 
ten  year*  ago.     Now.  she  wa* 
only   twenty-eight,  but  looking 
more  tlian  ten  years  older. 

'How  do  sou  feel  this  morning, 
dear?"  he  asked,  as  the  door 
opened  fri.ni  an  adjoining  room, 
•ir.d  Alice  came  in,  her  hair  un- 
coinbed,  her  soiled  morning-dress 
dragging  behind  her,  hci  cheeks 
white  and  flabby,  her  ^ryes  glit- 
tering unwholesimcly.

Jenny  came  in,  bare  arms  up- 
lifted, and  apron  w  hite  with  suds. 

The  land  protect  us,  Miss 
Bone !  Company's  come 
said,  aghast.  •There  isn't  a  mite 
n  the  house,  nor  bread 
nnther.  No,  nor  so  much  as 
ta_*te  of  yeast,  and  the  butter's  all 
out.  The  children  drunk  the  last

Sour-bag  yesterday.' 

Ring  went  the  bell,  sounding 
through  every  corner 
house. 

That's  a  Yank  l"  exclaimed 
Jenny,  trying  to  tuck  up  her  wisp 
of  back-hair.  'Well,  come  she 
must,  bad  as  it  looks.  So  here 
goes !'  and  she  made  for  the  door. 

As  for  Alice,  the  excitement, 
and  the  shame,  and  the  wonder, 
all  together,  had  brought  suffi- 
cient color  to  her  face  to  give  the 
to  all  her  pretension.  Hair, 
dress,  surroundings,  were  all 
snatched  at,  and  that  was  all. 
Nothing  could  be  bettered — dirt, 
untidiness,  sickness,  all  remained 
the  same,  as  an  awful  shadow  fell 
upon  her.

Straightened  und  brightened  ev-

ing a  pair  of  spectacles  over  her 
prim  little  nose,  proceeded  t" 
work  at  a  slocking  which  she  had 
picked  from  some  corner  of  her 
dress.  'Rheumatics  is  dreadful 
prevalent  in  ihe  pails  I  come

Now,  you  jest  set  comfortable,

and  1  do  lots  o'  cures.' 

Alice  longed  to  scream— to  ll\ 
•to  do  nil  sorts  of  impossible 
things,  to  get  out  of  the  way  of 
this  ever-flow  ing  babble,  but  there 
was  nothing  to  do  but  to  bear  it. 
Her  nerves  were  on  edge  ;  and 
when  John  came  home,  uston- 
ished  beyond  measure  at  this  raid 
on  his  household,  she  came  near 
going  into  hysterics.

beneficial  in  one  way.  Alice 
ouKl  enjoy  the  luxury  of  solitude

of  her  borrowed  novels,  sure  that 
all  the  household  would  go  right.

what  real  comfort  was.  since  he 
left  his  prim  New  Engi and  home,

The  little  ones  were  kept  rosy  and 
shining,  for  Emery  Jane  adored 
children,  and  had  the  secret  of 
attraction  for  th  m,  so  that  they 
no  longer  went  about  in  soiled 
pinaf  jres  ;  but  the  neighbors  as- 
cribed it  all  to  that  odd,  quaint 
liltle  Miss  Emery  Jane. 

Emery  was  keen  in  her  way. 
She  soon  fathomed  the  trouble  in 
her  brother's  household.  Saying 
little  to  his  wife  for  the  time, 
er  making  light  of  her  ailments, 
atched  her  chances,  and  de- 
termined to  give  the  self-styled 
invalid  the  benefit  of  her  wisdom. 

D  <tors  will  be  the  death  of 
you.  Miss  Boric,'  she  said,  one 
day.  'That's  fiic  seventh  time 
you've  taken  medicine  this  morn- 
llow  long  hev  you  been  liv- 
ing on  medicine  as  a  straight,

I'm  sure,  Miss  Emery,  I'd  do 
without  it  if  I  could.  But  if  you 
knew  what  awful  feel  ngs  I  have  ! 
Sometimes  1  think  I'm  going  to

ly.  'It's  nothing  but  nerves.  Book 
her  in  hand,  and  I  cured  her.  I'v« 
got  an  elixir  uiy  poor  father  left; 
Costs  a  proper  sight  of  money  to 
put  up  an  ounce,  but  it  never 
fails. 

Oh  !  Emery,  what  is  it?  I'll

'I'll  lake  il,  uud  be  glud  to. 

•I've  got  some  with  inc.' 

•Oh  1  Let  mc  sn-  it,'  laid

There's  no  humbug  about  that.'

sudden  terror.  'You  said  it  would

And  so  it  .vill — if  it  don't  dt

maid. 

I'll  not  die !  You  shan't  kill

Y.  Demeerol  says. 
Calob  Harria,  of  nndson,  Mich.,  bears  ot 
the  palm  from  all  competitors  in  tho  dar- 
ing and  romantio  feat  of  bare-back  riding. 
Ho  loft  Buffalo  on  the  17th  Inst,  with  two 
ear-loads  of  cows,  purchased  near  Hudson, 
and  destined  for  the  fine  dairy  forma  ot 
Madison  County,  in  this  State.  In  the 
early  port  of  tbe  evening  the  long  etoek 
train  stopped  nt  Fairport,  as  Mr.  Harris 
supposed,  for  cupper,  and  he  embraced  the 
opportunity  to  look  of  tor  the  welfare  of  his 
stock,  which  was  in  tho  forward  end  of  the 
train.  Finding  all  in  good  order,  ho  was 
nbont  returning  to  the  roar  of  tho  train, 
when  unexpectedly  tho  train  started,  one' 
so  rapidly  that  ho  deemed  it  haxardoits  U 
attempt  to  get  on  tho  caboose  when  il 
should  reach  him.  Resolved  not  to  be  left 
bo  mounted  tbo  train  nt  the  risk  of  life  and 
limb,  and  commonoed  walking  hack  to  thi 
caboose,  when  ho  foD  rvnd  camo  near  sliding 
off  to  tho  ground.  Uo  now  resolved  U 
mako  a  virtuo  of  necessity  anil  rido  U 
tbo  next  station  "on  deck."  After  braving 
tho  storm  aud  cold  and  wimlafow  moments 
he  foarod  ho  might  froczo  to  death  in  that 
exposed  position,  and  finding  a  trip- loo, 
on  tho  deck  of  tbo  shoop  air  on  whieh  h, 
stood,  ho  decided  lo  "go  belotr"  and  s.vk 
more  comfortahlo  quarters  among  his  veooMt 
follow  trave'Je/s. 

Here  he  was  foiled  aaTun,  for  tho  door, 
firmly  fastened  with  ioe  or  iron,  refused  ;< 
yield  to  his  attempts  to  force  it  op.-o.  Th  • 
only  reiuaiuing  ehiineo  wes  to  "turu  m" 
with  bis  horn  poMonjor*  snugly  stoivt-l 
awny  with  "overy  sitting  taken,"  as  it  stem- 
ed  to  any  olswrver.  H  was  short,  qtiics 
work.  Tbo  scuttlo  w:«  liftoit,  unl  h 
alighted  on  tho  back  of  a  fcisky  youn„ 
Durham.  Sho  objected  to  his  rudo  iutru- 
stou  in  bor  quiet  coach,  on-1  co  umuneed  lo 
kiek.  Sbo  squirmed,  and  twisted,  and 
fldgotod  till  finding  all  her  efforts  futile, 
sho  began  to  "bollow."  It  was  no  use. 
Tho  frightened  animal  was  in  a  tight  place, 
and  our  hero  was  master  of  tho  situatiou 
aud  fully  detonnincd  to  hold  out  and  be 
hold  on.  Tinio  soumed  long,  hnt  on  thun- 
dered tho  tram.  At  length  they  arrived 
In  Syracuse,  where  our  friend  found  a  re- 
lease from  his  catUc-cur  "Pullman,"  to  the 
Joy  no  less  of  his  companions  in  tho  ca- 
boose than  of  himself,  and  ho  now  congrat- 
ulates Umsolf  as  tho  oluuuplou  bit  ro- back 
rider  of  the  world,  hiving  ridden  fifty 
AiUoson  tho  unsaddled  back  of  a  cow.

MARSHFIELD. 

Kzel  Washburn  has  taken  down  * 
part  of  his  hotel  at  Brnnt  Rock  and 
moved  it  to  Onset. 

Capt.  Churchill  has  been  in  town 
this  last  week  making  the  necessary 
spring  repairs  to  his  hotel  - 
Rock. 

C.  Sumner,  of  the  Brant  Rock 
House,  is  to  run  the  hotel  this  sum- 
mer alone,  his  partner  heretofore,  Mr. 
Stearns,  is  to  run  a  hotel  at  Onset 
Bay  the  coming  season. 

This  time  of  the  year  last  season 
the  town  lost  about  $15,000  by  the 
carelessness  of  men  setting  fires.  It 
maybe  well  to  p'rint  a  copy  of  the 
law  in  regard  to  setting  fires,  and  we 
also  hope  that  the  selectmen  will  en- 
force it. 

What  is  supposed  to  be  the  compass 
of  the  steamer  "Grace  Irving"  togeth- 
er with  a  piece  of  wood  was  found  on 
the  heach  at  Brant  Rock  last  week. 
This  is  the  only  relic  of  the  ill  fated 
craft  that  went  down  together  with 
her  crew  one  Sunday  afternoon  some 
twelve  years  ago,  off  the  point  of  the 
rock,  that  has  ever  been  recovered. 

Josiah  C.  Williamson  with  wife  ai 
little  girl  from  Pescadero,  Cal..  a 
visiting  his  folks  here  in  Marshfield. 
Some  fifteen  years  ago  Si.  (who  was  a 
favorite  with  everybody  who  knew 
him)  left  Maishfield  for  the  golden 
state  and  settled  in  the  town  of  Pesca- 
dero, where  he  secured  a  good  posi- 
tion and  an  excellent  wife.  His  re- 
turn to  his  native  place  to  pay  a  visit 
to  his  parents  is  a  great  blesssing  to 
them  and  a  source  of  joy  to  all  who 
know  him. 

The  Webster  estate  at  Marshfield, 
which  was  lately  advertised  for  sale  is 
understood  to  have  been  purchased 
by  Mr.  Walton  Hall,  of  Quincy,  who, 
it  is  said,  will  occupy  it  as  a  summer 
residence.  But  little  remained  of  *he 
place  except  the  outbuildings  to 
awaken  memories  of  us  distinguished 
owner,  the  house  occupied  by  Webster 
having  given  place  to  a  new  a 
modern  structure  some  time  ago.  The 
price  at  which  the  place  was  pur- 
chased is  said  to  have  been  about 
$13,000.— Gazette. 

The  annual  gathering  of  the  chil- 
dren  and  grandchildren  of  Mrs.  Hul- 
dah  Lewis  in  remembrance  of  her 
birthday  occurred  last  Friday — sons 
and  daughters  from  Boston,  East 
Bridgewater,  Marshfield  and  other 
places,  gathered  to  spend  the  day 
with  the  venerable  old  lady  on  her 
92nd  birthday.  The  morning  was 
spent  in  greetings,  followed  by 
cellent  dinner  of  good  old  fashioned 
viands ;  after  which  about  twenty-five 
of  the  party,  including  "Grandma 
Lewis,"  took  a  walk  down 
Humarock,  by  the  kindness  of  a  man 
in  charge  of  the  hotel,  the  party  en 
joyed  an  hour  roaming  over  the  build- 
ing, and  along  its  verandas.  Although 
ninety-two  years,  "Grandma  Lewis'" 
retain*  her  mind  and  energy  equal  to 
a  lady  of  sixty  or  less.  The  raothei 
of  a  large  family  of  sons  and  daugh- 
ters of  whom  some  have  gone  to  the 
"other  shore,"  but  many  have  lived 
to  enjoy  the  happiness  of  annually 
gathering  together  around  the  old 
hearthstone  to  make  happy  their  be- 
loved mother,  of  whom  it  may  be  well 
said,  "Her  children  rise  up  and  call 
her  blessed."  May  she  be  spared  to 
celebrate  her  centennial  birthday. 


EAST  MARSHFIELD. 

The  young  ladies  and  gentlemen 
are  in  the  full  tide  of  glory  in  their 
hunts  for  Mayflowers  on  our  East 
Marshfield  heights.  Look  for  them 
under  the  trees  and  paitially  hidden. 
The  season  forgathering  them  is  in  its 
height  and  will  in  a  day  or  two  be 
over. 

We  are  glad  to  see  the  young  men 
of  East  Marshfield  take  good  posi- 
tions and  none  are  worthy  of  a  better 
one  than  Frank  Ames,  (son  of  Mrs. 
Wallace  Ames)  recently  appointed 
Station  master  at  our  depot.  We  wish 
him  success  and  have  no  doubt  that 
his  courteous  and  willing  disposition 
w-ill  ensure  it. 

The  long  standing  lawsuit  between 
Thos.  Holmes  and  Chas.  H.  Magoun 
culminated  last  week  in  hewing  to  the 
line  that  portion  of  Holmes'  barn  as 
is  claimed  by  Magoun  that  rests  on 
his  land  to  the  extent  of  about  one  or 
two  feet  and  resulting  in  the  remain- 
ing structure  caving  in,  presenting  a 
shattered,  blown  up,  forsaken,  aorry 
looking  wreck.

We  learn  that  Rev.  Mr.  Seaver 
interesting  some  of  our  young 
his  Sunday  scimonsand  these 
ones  to  interest,  for  it  is  upon  them 
that  the  future  church  and  state  mi 
rest.  Let  its  foundation  be  libc._. 
and  broad  enough  to  take  in  every 
thinker.  Sectarianism  is  the  out- 
growth  or  rather  ingrowth  of  igno- 
rance and  fear.  Let  the  bcyi  develop 
a  noble,  lirarty,  vigorous,  generous, 
manly,  and  all  absorbing  soul,  not  a 
liitle  mean,  shrivelled  up  thing,  with  a

n  id  not  an  inch  to  snare,  for  any  out- 
side of  his  own  and  that  of  bis  family 
nnd  church.  Heaven  «ave  us  from 
such  a  place,  with  such  little  souls  it 
would  be  hell  for  us  there.  Teach 
Hie  boys  to  be  just  and  obey  the  dic- 
tates of  their  conscience.  Think 
carefully  and  studiously,  "be  sure 


you're  right,  then  go  ahead."  L 
matter  what  this  one  and  that  one 
says,  don't  maiter  what  the -world 
savs,  what  do  you  say.  In  the  words 
of  that  nohle  old  Garrisonian  reform- 
er, Henry  C.  Wnght.  to  us,  "I  would 
rather,  said  he,  have  the  approbation 
of  Heniy  C.  Wright  than  all  the  world 
beside,"  Hew  to  the  line  of  duty 
wherever  you  are  and  in  whatever  you 
engage  to  do  and  let  the  chips 
where  they  will.  Whenever  a  young 
man  tremhles  at  the  laughs,  jeers  and 
sneers  of  his  companions  at  the  sup- 
per table,  ballot-box  or  bar  room,  sei 
him  down  as  a  nothing,  a  noncnity  or 
this  terrestial  sphere.  No,  boys  I  have 
pluck  for  the  right,  whether  in  the  old 
rut  or  out,  be  true  to  your  own  con- 
victions, present  them  fearlessly,  if 
right  stick  to  them,  should  the  heav- 
ens fall  and  if  wro:ig  and  you  have 
found  it  out  diop  them  as  red  hot 
coals.  This  is  our  platform  with 
breadth  enough  to  admit  anyone  with 
an  honest  thought,  don't  matter  what 
his  creed,  sect,  belief  or  'ism.

Presentation  Twenty-five  Years 
Ago. 

South  Scituate,  Mar.  12. 
On  Wednesday  P.  M.  the  9th  inst. 
leaving  our  own  school,  we  proceeded 
to  East  Marshfield,  to  witness  the  ex- 
amination of  the  school  in  district 
No.  4,  for  the  past  two  winters  under 
the  charge  of  Mr.  Hiram  A.  Oakman. 
Ai  riving  at  the  school-house  in  good 
season,  we  were  greeted  by  a  pleasant 
group  of  scholars  whose  merry  tones 
and  smiling  faces  so  far  from  betray- 
ing that  terrihle  fear  so  often  connec- 
ted in  the  mind  of  the  scholar  with 
examination,  betokened  a  firm  reli- 
ance on  their  own  abilities  and  an  in- 
dependence of  spirit  truly  creditable. 
The  exercises  of  the  a  iternoon,  occu- 
pying nearly  fjur  hours,  did  not  belie 
the  general  appearance  of  the  school, 
but  on  the  contrary  gave  evidence  of 
great  natural  ability  and  thoroughness 
on  the  part  of  the  teacher,  showing 
conclusively  that  he  has  not  mistaken 
his  calling.  Where  all  was  in  so  high 
a  degree  excellent,  it  were  difficult  to 
distinguish  ;  but  we  may  mention  as 
particularly  deserving  of  credit  a  rec- 
itation by  topics  from  the  first  class  in 
geography.  The  select  readings  by 
some  of  the  older  Misses  and  the  dec- 
lamations by  the  Masters  were  all 
performed  in  good  taste.  At  the 
close  of  the  exsreises  Master  Melvin 
Little  came  forward  and  presented  to 
Mr.  Oakman,  a  neat  gold-headed  cane, 
prefacing  the  worthy  deed  by  the  fol- 
lowing neat  and  expressive  speech  : 

Beloved  and  respected  Sir  :— We 
have  been  for  some  time  accustomed 
to  nie;t  you  daily  as  our  instructor  in 
this  place,  and  you  hjve  faithfully  la- 
bored with  us  and  we  in  some  meas- 
ure appreciate  your  valuable  scrvlees. 
But  the  time  is  near  when  we  go  out, 
probably  never  all  of  us  to  return  and 
pleasantly  meet  again  as  teacher  and 
pupils.  We  therefore  cannot  permit 
this  opportunity  to  pass  without  ex- 
pressing to  you,  kind  teacher,  our  love 
and  esteem,  and  furthermore  in  behalf 
of  these  your  pupils,  I  present  you, 
Sir,  this  walking  cane  as  a  more  sub- 
stantial and  endearing  testimony  of 
the  appreciation  of  your  services.  It 
is  a  small  thing,  we  know,  but  you  will 
consider  that  we  are  young  and  pos 
ss  hut  little;  but  please  accept  it,  dear 
r,  as  a  memento,  and  notwithftand- 
ing  you  do  not  now,  in  the  strength 
and  vigor  ot  manhood,  need  it,  yet  if 
in  the  good  Providence  of  God  you 
should  live  to  be  old  and  also  expe- 
rience the  decripitude  and  infirmities 
incident  to  age  and  your  step  become 
feeble  and  tottering  or  an  approxima- 
tion to  it,  you  will  then  find  your  staff 
usetul.  And  if  your  days  should  be- 
thus  lengthened,  as  we  hope  they  inav, 
perhaps  this  testimony  it  ill  be  lhe'n 
also  more  esteemed  from  the  consid- 
eration that  some  of  our  number  have 
passed  away  from  the  scenes  of  earth. 

Mr.  Oikman,  being  taken  entirely 
by  surprise,  was  much  affected  by  the 
event.  His  reply  couched  In  brief  but 
heartfelt  terms,  was  a  model  for  those 
who  are  so  fortunate  as  to  be  the  recip- 
ients of  like  tokens  of  esteem.  The 
feeling  expressed  by  the  scholars  and 
parents  present,  showed  how  deeply 
the  affection  between  teacher  and 
scholar  had  taken  root.  \\  e  returned 
much  gratified  with  our  visit.  Marsh- 
field may  cherish  an  honest  pride  for 
her  public  school*.  We  trust  that  the 
talent  displayed  bylier  rising  sons  and 
(laughter,  may  not  be  "put  under  a 
bushel."  Zeta  pM

A  subscription  paper  is  [round  lor

ness to  help  them  along. 

Last  week  seemed  something  like 
spring,  and  if  the  wtather  is  good, 
there  will  be  lots  of  seed  put  under 
ground  in  the  next  ten  days.  Many 
who  generally  have  sluff  well  along 
at  this  time  are  just  ploughing,  the 
ground  has  been  so  full  of  water  it 
has  been  useless  to  try  to  work  it 

Don't  jou  forget  the  meeting  to  be 
"held  at  Jones'  Factory,  Jones'  Hill. 
Find  a  man  that  votes  the  same  way 
you  do  and  has  no  team,  take  him 
in  and  carry  him  to  the  meeting  for 
there  is  fun  |in  the  air.  Call  out  the 
reserve  and  vote  >our  own  mind,  if 
you  have  any. 

Mr.  Isaac  Farrar,  a 
has  been  living  alone 
on  Central  street,  v- 
Thursday  morning; 
knowing  to  the 
death,  an  inquest  was  deemed  neces-

to  Rockland  for  Medical  Examiner 
Gleason,  ot  Rockland.  He  decided 
death  was  produced  by  natural  causes. 

Wouldn't  it  be  a  good  idea  if  the 
town  ever  elects  one  surveyor'  to  bear 
in  mind  S;lectman  Simmons,  for  he 
has  demonstrated  the  fact,  that  an 
immense  amount  of  work  can  be

to  take  a  drive  on  River  street,  fiom

will  find  a  well  crowned  highway  which

Mrs.  Baker  and  Miss  Sampson  have 
returned  to  their  home  for  the  surr- 
mer.  They  have  been  visiting 
friends  in  the  vicinity  of  Boston  for 
the  last  three  months. 

The  house  recently  purchased  by 
Mr.  Eugene  S.  Freeman,  is  undergo- 
ing extensive  repairs  and  is  now  in 
fine  shape,  both  inside  and  out.  He 
expects  to  occupy  it  in  about  two 

Among  the  number  who  called  for 
a  drink  at  one  of  the  hotels  May  1st, 
were  several  who  voted  no  at  the  an- 
nual lown  meeting.  But  they  were 
all  obliged  to  go  away  dry  for  once  in 
theii  lives. 

Mr.  Horace  Atwetl  has  opened  his 
new  shop  at  Hall's  Corner.and  is  now 
prepared  to  do  all  kinds  ol  hlaek- 
smithing  at  very  reasonable  prices. 
Being  an  experienced  workman,  peo- 
ple will  do  well  to  give  him  a  call 
and  see  for  themselves  what  he.  can 
We  wish  him  success  in  his  new 
enterprise.

SOUTH  DUXBUBY. 

The  I.  C.  May  ball  passed  of  pleas- 
antly, though  the  company  was  small- 
er than  usual  on  account  of  the  re 
turn  ball  at  L.  U.  Hall.  Dunbar*: 
band  furnished  mnsic. 

Many  of  our  house-owners  havt 
caught  the  "painting  craze,"  and  their 
pretty  homes  appear  in  an  entirely 
new  dress,  adding  much  to  the  ap- 
pearance of  the  neighborhood. 

Mayday  revived  the  drooping 
spirits  of  the  community,  with  bright 
sunshine,  and  a  cheap  ride  to  the 
Hub.  Spring  shopping  and  the  plaj 
ces  of  amusement  in  the  cily  attracted 
many  in  that  direction,  white  the  Ply 
mouth  festivities  drew  many  south- 
ward. Altogether  the  trains  were 
well  filled  on  that  day. 

The  view  fro>r.  Captain's  Hill  on 
May  day  was  unusually  fine.  The 
air  was  very  clear,  and  the  fog  so  of- 
ten obscuring  the  view  to  the  east- 
ward was  missing,  thus  allowing  an 
unobstructed,  outlook  far  beyond  the 
beach.  A  strong  breeze  was  blowing 
and  the  old  staging  about  the  monu- 
ment seemed  ready  to  fall  in  a  mass. 
Ought  it  not  to  be  removed  ?  For  in  a 
windy  day  heavy  timbers  are  likely  10 
fall  at  any  moment.  Surety  the  crazy 
affair  can  never  be  used.
