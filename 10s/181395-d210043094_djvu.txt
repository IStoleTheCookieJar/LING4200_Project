9.  In  the  event  Lessor  considers  that  Lessee  has  not  complied  with  all  its  obligations  hereunder,  both  express  and  implied,  Lessor  shall  notify  Lessee  in  writing,

commence  to  meet  all  or  any  part  of  the  breaches  alleged  by  Lessor.  The  service  of  said  notice  shall  be  precedent  to  the  bringing  of  any  action  by  Lessor  on  said  lease  for 
any  cause  and  no  such  act.cn  shall  be  brought  until  the  lapse  of  sixty  (60)  days  after  service  of  such  notice  on  Lessee.  Neither  the  service  of  said  notice  nor  the  doing  of 
any  acts  by  Lessee  aimed  to  meet  all  or  any  of  the  alleged  breaches  shall  be  deemed  an  admission  or  presumption  that  Lessee  has  failed  to  perform  all  its  obligations

operations  to  constitute  a  dnllmg  or  maximum  allowable  unit  under  applicable  governmental  regulations,  (but  in  no  event  less  that  forty  acres)  such  acreage  to  be

and  shall  not  be  required  to  move  or  remove  any  existing  surface  facilities  necessary  or  convenient  for  current  operations. 

10.  Lessor  hereby  warrants  and  agrees  to  defend  title  to  said  land  against  the  claims  of  all  persons  whomsoever.  Lessor's  rights  and  interests  hereunder  shall  be 
charged  primar.lv  with  any  mortgages,  taxes  or  other  liens,  or  interest  and  other  charges  on  said  land,  but  Lessor  agrees  that  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  at  any  time  to  pay  or 
reduce  same  for  Lessor  either  before  or  after  maturity,  and  be  subrogated  to  the  rights  of  the  holder  thereof  and  to  deduct  amounts  so  paid  from  royalties  or  other  payments 
payable  or  which  may  become  payable  to  Lessor  and/or  assigns  under  this  lease.  If  this  lease  covers  a  less  interest  in  the  oil,  gas,  sulphur,  or  other  minerals  in  all  or  any  part 
of  said  land  than  the  entire  and  undiv.ded  fee  simple  estate  (whether  Lessor's  interest  is  herein  specified  or  not),  or  no  interest  therein,  then  the  royalties  and  other  moneys 
accruing  from  any  part  as  to  which  this  lease  covers  less  than  such  full  interest,  shall  be  paid  only  in  the  proportion  which  the  interest  therein,  if  any,  covered  by  this  lease 

i°r^W  ,  u"divided  f«  s,mP,e  ^  therein.  All  royalty  interest  covered  by  this  lease  (whether  or  not  owned  by  Lessor)  shall  be  paid  out  of  the  royalty  herein 
provided.  This  lease  shall  be  binding  upon  each  party  who  executes  it  without  regard  to  whether  it  is  executed  by  all  those  named  herein  as  Lessor. 

1 1  If  while  this  lease  is  in  force,  at,  or  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term  hereof,  it  is  not  being  continued  in  force  by  reason  of  the  shut-in  well  provisions  of 
paragraph  3  hereof,  and  Lessee  is  not  conducting  operations  on  said  land  by  reason  of  (1 )  any  law,  order,  rule  or  regulation,  (whether  or  not  subsequently  determined  to  be 
invalid)  or  (2)  any  other  cause,  whether  similar  or  dissimilar,  (except  financial)  beyond  the  reasonable  control  of  Lessee,  the  primary  term  hereof  shall  be  extended  until 
the  first  anniversary  date  hereof  occurrmg  ninety  (90)  or  more  days  following  the  removal  of  such  delaying  cause,  and  this  lease  may  be  extended  thereafter  by  operations 
as  if  such  delay  had  not  occurred.  ^ 

12.  Ussor  agrees  that  this  lease  covers  and  includes  any  and  all  of  Lessor's  rights  in  and  to  any  existing  well(s)  and/or  wellbore(s)  on  said  land  other  than  existing 
water  wells,  and  for  all  purposes  of  this  lease  the  re-entry  and  use  by  Lessee  of  any  existing  well  and/or  wellbore  shall  be  deemed  the  same  as  the  drilling  of  a  new  well

nas  been  drilled  and  Lessee  intends  to  frac  shall  be  deemed  a  well  capable  of  producing  in  paying  quantities  and  the  date  such  well  is  shut-in  shall  be  when  the  drilling 
operations  are  completed.  & 

14  As  a  result  of  land  development  in  the  vicinity  of  said  land,  governmental  rules  or  ordinances  regarding  well  sites,  and/or  surface  restrictions  as  may  be  set  forth 
in  this  lease  and/or  other  leases  in  the  vicinity,  surface  locations  for  well  sites  in  the  vicinity  may  be  limited  and  Lessee  may  encounter  difficulty  securing  surface
