The  objective  of  this  study  is  to  develop  and  research  a  new  method  of 
reactive  power  compensation  in  industrial  grid  via  high-power  adjustable 
speed  drives  (HP  ASDs)  with  medium  voltage  (MV)  three  level  neutral  point

with  the  mathematical  description,  control  system  designing  and  obtaining  of 
experimental  results.  An  important  advantage  of  the  new  method  is  that 
specialized  equipment  is  not  necessary  for  its  implementation.  The  analysis 
of  our  experimental  research  shows  that  the  developed  reactive  power 
compensation  method  has  been  successfully  applied  for  main  HP  ASD  of 
plate  mill  rolling  state  5000  (Magnitogorsk  Iron  and  Steel  Works,  PJSC). 
Some  ways  for  future  industrial  application  prospects  and  improvements  of 
the  designed  method  are  outlined  in  the  conclusion  of  the  paper.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

In  recent  years,  the  use  of  power  converters  has  been  increasing,  mainly  due  to  the  global  demand 
for  electrical  energy.  Modern  power  converter  topologies  for  high-power  application  are  able  to  transmit  and 
convert  electric  power  with  small  losses  and  minimal  negative  influence  on  the  environment  [1-5].  Current 
economic  forecast  demonstrates  that  the  converter  market  for  power  energy  and  industry  applications  will 
continue  developing  and  improving  in  the  XXIst  century.  «MarketsandMarkets”  reports  that  in  the  years 
coming  the  volume  of  average  annual  investments  in  the  field  of  power  engineering  will  increase  up  to 
10%  [6].  Primarily,  it  will  be  connected  with  the  renovation  of  energy  infrastructure  and  implementation  of 
renewable  energy  projects  of  Europe  and  the  USA  and  with  the  increase  of  demand  from  fast  developing 
economics  of  China,  Russia,  India,  Brazil  and  South  Africa  [7],  Consequently,  research  in  the  field  of  power 
converters  to  improve  energy  efficiency  and  power  quality  acquire  special  significance  [8-10]. 

Currently,  non-reversible  and  reversible  medium  voltage  (MV)  high-power  (HP)  adjustable  speed 
drives  (ASDs)  based  on  multilevel  converter  topologies  are  main  electrical  energy  consumers  in  oil,  gas, 
metallurgical,  mining,  chemical,  cement,  paper  and  other  industry  applications  [11-13], 

HP  ASDs  can  be  found  commercially  in  single  or  paralleled  units  ranging  from  a  power  capacity 
of  0.4  to  200  MVA.  They  operate  at  the  medium-voltage  of  2.3  to  13.8  kV,  however,  a  typical  drive  voltage 
is  3.3  kV.  The  operation  of  HP  ASDs  in  MV  has  some  benefits  such  as  lower  current  ratings,  smaller  cables, 
smaller  dc-link  energy  storage  components  and  higher  efficiency;  therefore,  it  is  the  mainstream  solution 
found  in  the  HP-ASDs  in  practice  [14],

MV  3L-NPC  BtB  converters  are  most  often  applied  for  the  HP  ASDs  in  industrial  enterprises. 
Typical  power  circuits  as  an  illustration  are  shown  in  Figure  1.  Because  of  the  toughening  of  international 
standards  to  electromagnetic  compatibility  (EMC)  and  power  quality,  multipulse  grid  connection  circuits  are 
the  most  promising  for  both  raising  energy  efficiency  and  the  quality  of  converted  energy.  These  circuits  are 
used  at  one  of  the  world's  largest  steel  producers  and  a  leading  Russian  metals  company  Magnitogorsk  Iron 
and  Steel  Works,  PJSC.

2.  PROBLEM  DEFINITION  AND  ARTICLE  PURPOSES 

Currently,  power  quality  and  energy  efficiency  are  the  most  important  direction  in  the  enterprise 
development  to  reduce  production  costs.  In  practice,  our  experience  indicates  that  distribution  grid  companies 
penalize  industrial  plants  for  high  level  of  consumed  reactive  power.  In  such  situation,  it  is  profitable  to 
provide  an  industrial  distribution  grid  with  proper  reactive  power  control.  Furthermore,  the  profound  effects 
reactive  power  has  on  the  security,  efficiency  and  transmission  capacity  of  industrial  grid  are  well-known 
[15-17], 

Reactive  power  compensation  is  one  of  the  most  effective  ways  to  reduce  consumed  electric 
energy  and  improve  power  quality.  The  examples  of  how  reactive  power  compensation  can  improve  the 
technical-and-economic  indexes  of  an  industrial  power  grid  are  [18-21]: 

a.  Reduce  cost  and  generate  higher  revenue  for  the  customer; 

b.  Reduce  network  losses; 

c.  Avoid  penalty  charges  from  utilities  for  excessive  consumption  of  reactive  power; 

d.  Increase  system  capacity  and  save  costs  on  new  installations; 

e.  Improve  system  power  factor; 

f.  Increase  power  availability; 

g.  Improve  voltage  regulation  in  the  network. 

Nowadays,  static  VAR  compensators  (SVCs)  and  static  synchronous  compensators  (STATCOMs) 
are  the  most  useful  to  control  the  dynamic  reactive  power  level  in  the  industrial  grid  [22-24].  It  is  important 
to  note  the  main  difference  between  STATCOM  and  3L-NPC  BtB  converters  is  their  load  sides,  but  there  is 
the  same  connection  in  the  grid  side. 

The  majority  of  cases  reported  in  the  literature  relate  to  the  static  reactive  power  compensation 
using  active  front-end  (AFE)  rectifier.  This  approach  was  firstly  introduced  for  the  dragline  eclectic  drives

case  in  [25].  In  addition,  most  existing  works  in  this  field  have  been  done  using  either  wind  or  solar  electrical 
systems  [26]. 

This  article  will  present  some  experiments  showing  the  potential  use  of  dynamic  reactive  power 
compensation  via  HP  ASDs  with  medium  voltage  3L-NPC  BtB  converters.  A  new  method  of  the  reactive 
power  control  that  has  been  applied  for  this  problem  is  described.  As  a  research  object,  the  main  HP  ASDs  of 
the  plate  mill  rolling  state  5000  (Magnitogorsk  Iron  and  Steel  Works,  PJSC)  has  been  chosen.  To  investigate 
a  reactive  power  compensation  mode,  it  is  necessary  to  perform  synthesis  of  the  new  control  system  of  the 
3L-NPC  BtB  converter  for  operating  conditions  of  the  main  HP  ASDs  of  the  plate  mill  rolling  state  5000  by 
using  a  mathematical  description. 

3.  3L-BTB-NPC  CONVERTER  AS  CONTROLLING  OBJECT 

The  well-known  mathematical  models  of  multilevel  converters  are  based  on  a  splitting  method.  It 
allows  one  to  split  electrical  circuit  on  sub-electrical  circuits  and  to  ensure  their  interaction.  However,  such  a 
way  does  not  provide  for  the  making  of  convenient  mathematical  models  and  development  of  a  control 
system  [27-29]. 

The  3L-BtB-NPC  converter  as  shown  in  Figure  1  contains  24  semiconductor  power  modules 
V7j-VT24,  24  forward  diodes  VDrVD2h  12  clamped  diodes  VDcl-VDcl 2  and  two  equivalent  capacitors 
C,jt  rC,/(;2  between  which  a  neutral  point  0  is  formed  [14-16].  The  mathematical  description  method  is  based 
on  discrete  logic  functions  yabc,  -semiconductor  device  switching  states  .S'„/,r/2,v  for  the  3L-BtB-NPC  converter

Figure  3.  Functional  diagram  of  the  control  system 


The  control  system  is  two-loop  and  consists  of  two-channel  current  control  systems  and  the 
external  DC  voltage  control  loop,  reactive  power  control  loop  and  a  load  control  system.  It  allows  for  a 
separate  regulating  of  the  active  id  and  reactive  iq  current  components.  To  realize  this  linear  control  method, 
the  abc/dq  transformation  for  the  measured  phase  current  iabcmeg  to  idqmeg  has  been  applied.  Deviations  from 
the  difference  between  the  reference  current  signals  idqrej  and  measured  current  signals  idqmeg  are  processed  by 
PI  current  controllers.  Additional  signals  from  cross-coupling  compensation  (CCC)  blocks  are  the  summed 
outputs  of  PI  current  controllers  and  fed  to  the  PWM  units.  Phase-locked  loops  (PDFs)  are  used  to  calculate 
grid  and  load  voltage  angles  0n„  The  active  current  loop  of  the  grid  side  is  subordinated  to  the  external  DC 
voltage  control  loop.  Deviations  from  the  difference  between  the  reference  DC  voltage  signal  udcref  and 
measured  DC  voltage  signals  udcmeg  are  processed  by  a  DC  voltage  controller.  The  internal  reactive  current 
loop  iqr  is  subordinated  to  the  external  reactive  power  control  system. 

Control  system  designing  with  a  reactive  control  loop  was  synthesized  on  the  basis  of  the  system 
"3F-NPC  BtB  converter  -  industrial  grid"  shown  in  Figure  4.  This  system  consists  of  voltage  EBtB,  equivalent 
inductance  L2,  equivalent  resistance  R2,  transformer  T,  grid  voltage  Eg,  transformer  secondary  winding 
voltage  Et,  equivalent  inductance  Lj,  and  equivalent  resistance  R

noted  that  a  range  of  the  shift  angle  between  the  transformer  secondary  winding  voltage  and  the  3L-NPC  BtB 
voltage  is  low.  It  indicates  that  the  reactive  power  control  system  have  to  provide  high  accuracy  and 
performance  reliability  in  all  operation  conditions  of  the  ASDs  with  the  3L-NPC  BtB  converters  [30-32]. 

A  functional  scheme  of  the  proposed  reactive  power  control  method  is  shown  in  Figure  6.  The 
scheme  provides  a  real-time  measurement  of  the  reactive  power  at  the  secondary  control  level  and  produce  a 
reactive  power  reference  signal  at  the  local  control  level  of  the  3L-NPC  BtB  converter.  If  in  the  connection 
point  of  substation  and  the  ASDs  there  is  a  requirement  to  increase  or  reduce  the  reactive  power  level,  the 
3L-NPC  BTB  converters  will  be  able  to  generate  or  consume  a  shape  of  reference  reactive  power.  An 
important  advantage  of  the  new  method  is  that  specialized  equipment  is  not  necessary  for  the 
implementation.

Figure  9  shows  that  the  main  HP  ASD  of  the  plate  mill  rolling  state  5000  has  a  maximum  load  at 
finish  rolling  and  there  is  no  possibility  to  generate  additional  reactive  power.  But  in  Figure  8  it  is  clearly 
seen  that  at  roughing  there  is  an  underutilization  of  the  apparent  power. 

Based  on  the  experimental  results,  it  was  concluded  that  the  main  HP  ASD  of  the  plate  mill  rolling 
state  5000  can  be  applied  as  a  static  or  dynamic  reactive  power  compensator  in  the  range  of  roughing.  Using 
the  designed  reactive  power  control  (Chapter  III.  B),  it  was  possible  to  achieve  6.4  MVAR  reactive  power 
generation  in  all  the  roughing  range  of  the  main  HP  ASD  of  the  plate  mill  rolling  state  5000  (Magnitogorsk 
Iron  and  Steel  Works,  PJSC).  It  is  clearly  seen  in  Figure  10.

6.  CONCLUSION 

The  new  reactive  power  compensation  method  in  the  industrial  grid  via  high-power  adjustable 
speed  drives  with  the  medium  voltage  3L-NPC  BtB  converters  has  been  proposed.  It  can  be  recommended  to 
correct  a  power  factor  or  compensate  static  or  dynamic  reactive  power.  A  level  of  compensated  reactive 
power  should  be  calculated  in  accordance  with  load  impedance  diagrams  and  parameters  of  the  grid  side  and 
3L-NPC  BtB  converters. 

An  important  advantage  of  the  new  method  is  that  specialized  equipment  is  not  necessary  for  the 
implementation.  The  analysis  of  experimental  research  shows  that  the  developed  reactive  power 
compensation  method  has  been  successfully  applied  for  the  main  HP  ASD  of  the  plate  mill  rolling  state  5000 
(Magnitogorsk  Iron  and  Steel  Works,  PJSC). 

The  huge  prospects  of  HP  ASDs  with  3L-NPC  BtB  converters  to  integrate  them  into  Smart  Grid 
systems  have  been  determined.  It  is  a  good  solution  as  they  are  able  to  provide  a  high  power  flow  and  control 
a  reactive  power  flow  by  the  control  system  of  3L-NPC  BtB  converters.  It  can  reduce  a  share  of  the 
consumed  reactive  power  from  the  grid  and  improve  power  quality.
