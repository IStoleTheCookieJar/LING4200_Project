Introduction 


he mission of the U.S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture (USDA) is 
to enhance the quality of life 
for the American people by supporting 
production agriculture; ensuring a safe, 
affordable, nutritious, and accessible 
food supply; caring for agricultural, 
forest, and range lands; supporting 
sound development of rural communi- 
ties; providing economic opportunities 
for farm and rural residents; expanding 
global markets for agricultural and 
forest products and services; and 
working to reduce hunger in America 
and throughout the world. 





USDA’s Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service (APHIS) is respon- 
sible for ensuring the health and care 
of animals and plants. APHIS im- 
proves agricultural productivity and 
competitiveness and contributes to the 
national economy and the public 
health. USDA’s Food Safety and 
Inspection Service (FSIS) is respon- 
sible for protecting the Nation’s meat 
and poultry supply—making sure it is 
safe, wholesome, unadulterated, and 
properly labeled and packaged. These 
two agencies have come together to 
lead USDA’s actions in the prevention, 
monitoring, and control of bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in 
the U.S. livestock and food supply. 
The public knows BSE as “mad 
cow disease,” a disease linked to 
human cases of new-variant 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD). 
USDA knows BSE as the disease that 
devastated the livestock industry in the 
United Kingdom and shattered con- 
sumer confidence in Europe. BSE has 
affected international trade and all 
aspects of the animal and public health 
communities. It has called even 






greater attention to the U.S. 
Government’s accountability for a safe 
food supply. 

No case of BSE has ever been 
found in the United States. Since 
1989, USDA has had a number of 
stringent safeguards in place to 
prevent BSE from entering the coun- 
try. USDA conducts an ongoing, 
comprehensive interagency surveil- 
lance program for BSE. This surveil- 
lance program allows USDA to 
monitor actively for BSE to ensure 
immediate detection in the event that 
BSE were to be introduced into the 
United States. 

Immediate detection allows for 
swift response. As an emergency 
preparedness measure, USDA has 
developed this BSE Response Plan to 
be initiated in the event that a case of 
BSE is diagnosed in the United States. 
The Plan details comprehensive 
instructions for USDA staff as to who 
is to do what, when, where, and how 
in the event that BSE were to be 
diagnosed in the United States. 


October 1998 





APHIS and FSIS have 
come together to lead 
USDA actions in the 
prevention, monitoring, 
and control of bovine 
spongiform enceph- 
alopathy (BSE) in U.S. 
livestock and the food 


supply.

Background 






», PHIS is responsible for being 
_ prepared for potential foreign 

A. animal disease outbreaks. The 
purpose of such preparation is to 
provide a step-by-step plan of action in 
the event that a foreign animal disease, 
such as BSE, is detected in the United 
States. These plans, often referred to 
as “Red Books,” provide guidance by 
outlining certain actions that should 
take place, such as identification of a 
suspect animal, laboratory confirma- 
tion, epidemiologic investigation, and 
animal and herd disposition activities. 
Copies of Red Books for specific 
foreign animal diseases are distributed 
to agency headquarters and each 
regional and field office to have in 
preparation for a disease outbreak. 

In 1990, APHIS developed a plan 
to respond to a confirmation of BSE in 
the United States. In August 1996, a 
joint APHIS-—FSIS working group 
updated the BSE Red Book in accor- 
dance with current science and re- 
search surrounding BSE and the 
related family of diseases called 
transmissible spongiform encephalopa- 
thies (TSE’s). The BSE Red Book is 
officially entitled BSE Emergency 
Disease Guidelines. 

The APHIS-FSIS working group 
determined that the BSE Red Book, 
which detailed laboratory and field 
activities to be carried out in an 
emergency, needed another compo- 
nent. After the March 1996 announce- 
ment by the United Kingdom that BSE 
was linked to nvCJD, it became 
apparent to the working group that the 
Plan needed to address communication 
issues, both internally within USDA 
and the Federal Government and 
externally to the public at large. A 
confirmed case of BSE would affect 


October 1998 





such a vast array of stakeholders— 
consumers, cattle producers, the food 
animal industry, international trading 
partners, animal and public health 
communities, media, and others. 
Having clear, accurate information 
readily available would build trust and 
credibility and facilitate any response 
measures needed. There needed to be 
a notification plan. Who was respon- 
sible for notifying who, what, when, 
and how? The Plan needed to identify 
clear channels of communication as to 
ensure immediate collection and 
dissemination of accurate information. 

The joint APHIS-—FSIS working 
group became formally known as the 
BSE Response Team and is responsible 
for the development of this BSE 
Response Plan. BSE Response Team 
members represent a mix of back- 
grounds and expertise, including 
veterinary medicine, food safety, 
public health, epidemiology, pathol- 
ogy, international trade, and public 
affairs. The Team is coordinated by 
two Team leaders, one each from 
APHIS and FSIS, who serve as 
liaisons and technical advisors to their 
respective agencies on regulations and 
policies regarding BSE. 

Over the past 2 years, the BSE 
Response Plan has been reviewed, 
edited, revised, and approved by 
officials at all levels of APHIS, FSIS, 
and USDA. The Plan has also been 
shared with other Government agen- 
cies, such as the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC), and the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH), and other stakeholders, 
such as the Animal Ag Coalition.

Notification: Roles and 
Responsibilities 


Surveillance 


As part of USDA’s surveillance 
program for BSE in the United States, 
veterinary pathologists and field 
investigators from APHIS and FSIS 
have received training from British 
counterparts in diagnosing BSE. FSIS 
inspects cattle before they go to 
slaughter; these inspection procedures 
include identifying animals with 
central nervous system conditions. 
Animals with such conditions are 
considered suspect for BSE, prohibited 
from slaughter, and referred to APHIS 
for examination as explained below. 

Pathologists at APHIS’ National 
Veterinary Services Laboratories 
(NVSL) histopathologically examine 
the brains from these condemned 
animals. In addition, samples are 
tested using a technique called immu- 
nohistochemistry, which tests for the 
presence of the protease-resistant prion 
protein (a marker for BSE). NVSL 
also examines samples from neurologi- 
cally ill cattle and nonambulatory 
(“downer”) cattle identified on the 
farm or at slaughter and from rabies- 
negative cattle submitted to veterinary 
diagnostic laboratories and teaching 
hospitals. 


Notification 


Because of their responsibility for 
examining condemned or BSE-suspect 
animals, NVSL is the organization 
responsible for activating the notifica- 
tion and BSE response process. It is 
NVSL that will begin the activation of 
the BSE Response Plan. From the 
time a sample is submitted, it takes 14 


October 1998 





to 18 days to confirm a diagnosis of 
BSE In the first 10 to 13 days, pa- 
thologists at NVSL have enough 
information to either rule out BSE or 
determine the need for additional tests. 
If it is determined that there is no 
evidence of BSE, the results are added 
to the more than 7,500 others that have 
also been negative. NVSL maintains 
these data. 

If additional tests do suggest a 
presumptive diagnosis of BSE, an 
NVSL pathologist will hand carry the 
sample to the United Kingdom for 
confirmation. It is at this critical 
point, when NVSL suggests a diagno- 
sis of BSE and is preparing to send the 
sample to the United Kingdom, that 
this BSE Response Plan is initiated. 
The Plan begins the preliminary 
notification from NVSL to APHIS. 


Preliminary Notification 


The director of NVSL is responsible 
for immediately notifying the APHIS, 
Veterinary Services (VS) deputy 
administrator when tests suggest a 
presumptive diagnosis of BSE. 

Once NVSL has made a presump- 
tive diagnosis of BSE, APHIS and 
FSIS field activities will also be 
initiated. APHIS will receive notifica- 
tion (either confirming or not confirm- 
ing NVSL’s diagnosis) from the 
United Kingdom anywhere between 
24 and 96 hours. (The international 
animal health community has recog- 
nized the United Kingdom’s Central 
Veterinary Laboratory [CVL] as the 
world’s reference laboratory for 
diagnosing BSE. Other countries, 
including Belgium, France, Ireland, 
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portu- 
gal, and Switzerland, have all sent 
samples to this lab to confirm their 
first cases of BSE.)

staff and the VS Deputy Administrator 
at headquarters. In addition, the 
regional director shares all information 
with the BSE Response Team. 


APHIS, VS, AVIC 

The VS AVIC, in cooperation with 
State animal health authorities, is 
responsible for coordinating the field 
activities surrounding the emergency 
response to BSE. The AVIC assembles 
the local VS staff to initiate activities 
outlined in the BSE Red Book, includ- 
ing tracing the progeny and herdmates 
of the suspect animal and beginning an 
epidemiologic investigation. The VS 
AVIC coordinates with the State 
Veterinarian to quarantine the suspect 
animal’s herd of origin. The State has 
the authority to order a routine quaran- 
tine for a neurological disease. The 
BSE Response Team surveyed every 
State to determine if they would utilize 
this authority in the event that NVSL 
identifies a presumptive diagnosis of 
BSE. All States responded that they 
would issue a quarantine. 


October 1998 





BSE Response Team 

The BSE Response Team leaders will 
notify each team member and instruct 
them to assemble in the Situation 
Room at APHIS headquarters in 
Riverdale, MD. The Team leaders are 
responsible for ensuring that all of the 
Team’s duties are fulfilled. It is their 
responsibility to ensure that the 
technical information and expert 
recommendations reach the 
decisionmakers in a timely fashion. 
Together with VS’ Emergency Pro- 
grams staff, the Team leaders will 
obtain APHIS, VS administrative 
support staff in Riverdale, MD, to 
ready the room for use as BSE head- 
quarters. 

The Team will begin gathering and 
assembling information from APHIS 
and FSIS region and field staff. The 
Team will pull the draft documents 
from the third section in the Team 
leaders’ manuals and begin filling in 
current information as it becomes 
available. 


Public Notification 


Should NVSL receive notice from 
CVL confirming a case of BSE, the 
next level of notification is activated. 
Each player will follow the same 
notification protocol as described 
above for preliminary notification to 
confirm the diagnosis of a case of 
BSE. 


BSE Response Team 

The BSE Response Team will com- 
plete the informational memorandum 
for the Secretary. 

The Team will prepare the letter to 
the Office of International Epizootics 
(OIE), the international animal health 
organization, for signature by the 
APHIS, VS Deputy Administrator.
