Contents >> Chapter 1. Introduction 


Purpose of the ASRC 


1. The Australian Standard Research Classification (ASRC) is the collective name for a set of three related classifications developed for use in 
the measurement and analysis of research and experimental development (R&D) undertaken in Australia, both in the public and private 
sectors. It allows the comparison of R&D data between sectors of the Australian economy (e.g. general government, private non-profit 
organisations, business enterprises and educational institutions). One of the component classifications, Research Fields, Courses and 
Disciplines, is designed to also allow data collected on higher education courses, units of study and teaching activity to be categorised. 


2. Use of these classifications ensures that R&D statistics and statistics collected from higher education institutions are useful to governments, 
educational institutions, international organisations, scientific, professional or business organisations, business enterprises, community groups 
and private individuals. 


3. To support international comparisons, it is important for the classifications to relate to those used in other countries, particularly those 
whose stage of social and economic development is similar to that of Australia. Therefore, the definition, scope and classification of R&D 
activities contained in this publication largely follow the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Proposed 
Standard Practice for Surveys of Research and Experimental Development, "Frascati Manual", Fifth Revision 1993. 


4. The classifications contained in the ASRC are used for the compilation of R&D statistics and, commencing in 2000, will be used for 
classifying other selected statistics collected from higher education institutions. Details about these statistics are released in the following 
publications: 


e Research and Experimental Development, Business Enterprises, Australian Bureau of Statistics (8104.0); 


e Research and Experimental Development, General Government and Private Non-Profit Organisations, Australian Bureau of Statistics 
(8109.0); 


e Research and Experimental Development, Higher Education Organisations, Australian Bureau of Statistics (8111.0); 
e Research and Experimental Development, All Sector Summary, Australian Bureau of Statistics (8112.0); and 
e publications of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. 
5. The development of the classifications in this publication has been undertaken by the ABS in co-operation with major research 


organisations and users of research information. This consultative process has sought to ensure that the ASRC is widely accepted and used 
within Australia as an Australian Standard, not only in the compilation of R&D statistics but also in the study of Australian research generally. 


Classifications included in the publication 
6. There are three classifications in the ASRC: 


e Type of Activity; 
e Research Fields, Courses and Disciplines ; and 


e Socio-economic Objective. 
These are used in official statistics to analyse the nature of R&D undertaken in Australia. The classifications are used in conjunction with 
industrial and institutional sector classifications to produce a set of official statistics which support a variety of user interests. In addition, the 
Research Fields, Courses and Disciplines classification will be used by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs 
to classify data collected from higher education institutions. 
Type of Activity Classification (TOA) 


7. This classification allows R&D activity to be categorised according to the type of research effort, namely, pure basic research, strategic 
basic research, applied research and experimental development. 


8. Definitions and guidelines for classifying R&D by TOA are covered in Chapter 2. 
Research Fields, Courses and Disciplines Classification (RFCD) 


9. This classification allows both R&D activity and other activity within the higher education sector to be categorised. It allows R&D activity to 
be categorised according to the field of research undertaken. In this respect, it is the nature of the R&D which is being examined. In addition, 
the classification is to be used within the higher education sector to classify courses, units of study and teaching activity to field. 


10. The categories in the classification include recognised academic disciplines and related major sub-fields taught at universities or tertiary 
institutions, major fields of research investigated by national research institutions and organisations, and emerging areas of study. 


11. Explanatory notes, definitions and guidelines for classifying data and the full classification are covered in Chapter 3. 
Socio-economic Objective Classification (SEO) 


12. This classification allows R&D to be categorised according to the purpose of the R&D as perceived by the data provider (researcher). It 
consists of discrete economic, social, technological or scientific domains for identifying the principal purpose of the R&D. The attributes 
applied to the design of the SEO Classification comprise a combination of processes, products, health, education and other social and 
environmental aspects of particular interest. 


13. Explanatory notes, definitions and guidelines for classifying R&D by socio-economic objective and the full classification are covered in 
Chapter 4. 


Advantages of the ASRC 


14. The ASRC provides a three way matrix of classification. Each R&D activity can be classified by Type of Activity, Research Fields, Courses 
and Disciplines and Socio-economic Objective. 


15. The ASRC provides a considerable degree of flexibility in meeting the needs of a wide variety of users. The hierarchical structure of both 
the RFCD and SEO Classifications enables them to be applied to particular purposes at various levels. 


16. If the requirement is for general policy purposes, then a variety of approaches is available. For example, by using data compiled according 
to both the RFCD and SEO Classifications, it is possible to identify how much R&D expenditure in any particular field of research has been 
devoted to a particular socio-economic objective. The ASRC helps classify multi-disciplinary work, where several disparate areas of the RFCD 
are usually brought together to address one area, or closely related areas of the SEO. 


17. The complexity of issues addressed by R&D is such that questions of public policy often arise in a manner which cannot be readily seen in 
advance. The detail available in both the RFCD and SEO Classifications would be sufficient to facilitate the provision of statistics which can be 
used in a variety of contexts. For example, areas of key technological significance could generally be assessed using an aggregate of 
appropriate RFCD disciplines or subjects. It is possible, therefore, that the use of the ASRC for ABS R&D surveys may obviate or minimise 
the need for separate one-off R&D surveys aimed at narrow areas. 


18. A particular strength of the ASRC is that it preserves comparability with much previous data in the ABS R&D series, while possessing a 
framework which enables comparisons with other classifications used nationally and internationally. 


19. In the case of the SEO Classification, there is a strong alignment between the SEO and the Australian and New Zealand Standard 
Industrial Classification (ANZSIC). This is most applicable within the manufacturing subdivision of the SEO. It is possible to correlate trends in 
industry with levels of R&D directed towards particular industries, by using both SEO and ANZSIC data. 


Definition of Research and Experimental Development 


20. R&D is defined according to the OECD standard as comprising creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the 
stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications. 


21. An R&D activity is characterised by originality. It has investigation as a primary objective, the outcome of which is new knowledge, with or 
without a specific practical application, or new or improved materials, products, devices, processes or services. R&D ends when work is no 
longer primarily investigative. 


Scope of Research and Experimental Development 


22. As indicated in the Frascati Manual and as experience has shown, there are difficulties in delineating the point which clearly separates the 
culmination of R&D investigative work and the beginning of the implementation phase of the innovations or recommendations resulting from 
R&D. Errors at this point are particularly significant because, although R&D programmes require large outlays of resources, the costs of 
implementing innovations or recommendations resulting from R&D may also be as high or higher in many instances. 


23. There are also a wide range of scientific and related activities which are not R&D, but which are closely linked with R&D in terms of 
organisation, resource allocation, institutional affiliation and the use or flow of information. However, activities conducted solely or primarily for 
the purposes of R&D support are included in R&D. 


24. The activities which do not have clear boundaries with R&D are listed below. 

(a) Education and training of personnel and students 

Postgraduate research, including supervision of the research, is considered to be R&D. The development of new teaching methods is also 
regarded as R&D. However, teaching and training students, using established methods and subject knowledge, is excluded. 

(b) Specialised scientific and technical information services 

Specialised scientific and technical information services which are undertaken solely in support of R&D are regarded as R&D. Examples of 
these are scientific data collection, coding, recording, classification, dissemination, translation, analysis and bibliographic services. 

These specialised services are excluded if they are undertaken independently and not solely in support of R&D. 


(c) General purpose or routine data collection 


Collecting data in support of R&D work is included in R&D. 

However, data collection of a general nature is excluded. This is normally carried out by government agencies to record natural, biological, 
economic or social phenomena of general public or government interest. Examples are national population censuses, surveys of 
unemployment, topographical mapping and routine geographical or environmental surveys. 

(d) Maintenance of national standards 

Routine testing and analysis of materials, components, products, processes, soils, atmospheres, etc. for standard compliance is excluded 
from R&D. 

(e) Feasibility studies 

Feasibility studies undertaken in support of R&D are included. However, a feasibility study which involves gathering information about existing 
conditions, for use in deciding whether or not to implement a project, is excluded, e.g. a study to determine the viability of a petrochemical 
complex in a particular location. 

(f) Specialised medical care 

R&D includes the development of new treatments and procedures, including such developments in conjunction with advanced medical care 


and examinations usually carried out by university hospitals. 


However, routine investigations or normal application of specialised medical knowledge, techniques or equipment are excluded from R&D. 
Examples of these are pathology, forensic and post mortem procedures. 


(g) Patent and licence work 

Patent work connected directly with R&D projects is included in R&D. However, commercial, administrative and legal work associated with 
patenting, copywriting and licensing, is excluded. 

(h) Policy related studies 

The boundary between certain policy related studies as described in the Frascati Manual and R&D is complex. In the Frascati Manual, policy 
related studies cover activities such as the ‘analysis and assessment of existing programmes, continued analysis and monitoring of external 
phenomena (e.g. defence and security analysis), legislative inquiry concerned with general government departmental policy or operations’. 


Rigour is required to separate policy related studies which are not R&D from true R&D policy work. 


Studies to determine the effects of a specific national policy to a particular economic or social condition or social group may have elements of 
R&D. Routine management studies or efficiency studies are excluded. 


(i) Marketing and market studies 


Market research and opinion polls are excluded from R&D. 


(j) Mineral exploration 


The development of new or vastly improved methods of data acquisition, processing and interpretation of data is included as R&D. Surveying 
undertaken as an integral part of an R&D project to observe geological phenomena is also regarded as R&D. However, the search for 
minerals using existing methods is excluded from R&D. 


(k) Prototypes and pilot plants 


The design, construction and testing of prototypes generally falls within the scope of R&D. However, trial production and copying of prototypes 
are excluded from R&D. 


The construction and operation of pilot plants is part of R&D provided that these are used to obtain experience or new data for evaluating 
hypotheses. 


Pilot plants are excluded from R&D as soon as the experimental phase is over or as soon as they are used as normal commercial production 
units, even if they continue to be described as ‘pilot plants’. If a pilot plant is used for combined operations, the component used for R&D is to 
be estimated. 


(I) Other activities 


All other activities which are ancillary or consequential to R&D are excluded. Examples of these are interpretative commentary using existing 
data, forecasting, operations research as a contribution to decision making and the use of standard techniques in applied psychology to 
classify or diagnose human characteristics. 


R&D Unit to be classified 

25. There are some inherent difficulties in formulating a definition of what constitutes a unit of R&D. Because there is a lack of uniformity in 
organisational structures and considerable variation in the way organisations allocate resources to R&D activities, any standard definition of a 
unit of R&D seems certain to be somewhat theoretic. From a statistical viewpoint it is desirable that R&D expenditure be reported in the 
smallest cluster which can be classified to a single field of research and a single socio-economic objective. The extent to which it is not 
practicable to provide this detail will reduce the validity and usefulness of the classification, and the resulting R&D statistics. 


26. The most common real world references to an R&D unit whose activities are to be classified are Research Program and Research Project. 
However, these focal units would seldom approximate the idealised unit of R&D as outlined above. They may or may not correspond to actual 
organisational structures. In its most simple form, a Research Project may consist of a part of the time and energy of an own account single 
entity (such as a PhD student). 


27. There are Research Projects, especially in the social sciences, which require a multi-disciplinary approach in order to achieve a purpose. 
There are also Research Projects which consist of sub-projects. For example, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research 
Organisation (CSIRO) has cited a Research Project as often consisting of a set of sub-projects (staff) with a common purpose and one person 
designated as the project leader.

About this Release 


Contents 


e Pure basic research 

e Strategic basic research 

e Applied research 

e Experimental development 


2. Pure basic research is experimental and theoretical work undertaken to acquire new knowledge without looking for long term benefits other 
than the advancement of knowledge. 


3. Strategic basic research is experimental and theoretical work undertaken to acquire new knowledge directed into specified broad areas in 
the expectation of useful discoveries. It provides the broad base of knowledge necessary for the solution of recognised practical problems. 


4. Applied research is original work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge with a specific application in view. It is undertaken either 
to determine possible uses for the findings of basic research or to determine new ways of achieving some specific and predetermined 
objectives. 


5. Experimental development is systematic work, using existing Knowledge gained from research or practical experience, that is directed to 
producing new materials, products or devices, to installing new processes, systems and services, or to improving substantially those already 
produced or installed. 


Guidelines for classifying R&D by TOA 

6. A Research Project is normally to be classified under only one type of activity. However, there are instances where a research project is 
large and could potentially be classifiable to more than one type, i.e. a project could have sub-projects with elements of both applied and 
experimental research. In this case, the proportion of resources attributable to each should be allocated to each type.

Nature and purpose of the RFCD classification 


Page tools: a!) Print Page 


About this Release 


Contents 


1. This classification allows both R&D activity and other activity within the higher education sector to be categorised. 


2. The categories in the classification include recognised academic disciplines and related major sub-fields taught at universities or tertiary 
institutions, major fields of research investigated by national research institutions and organisations, and emerging areas of study. 


3. While this classification includes individual specialised fields of national interest, it generally reflects the overall structure of disciplinary 
fields. 


4. R&D activity is classified according to the field of research undertaken. In this respect, it is the nature of the R&D itself which is being 


examined, rather than the activity of the performing unit or the purpose of the R&D. Higher education courses, units of study and teaching 
activity are classified according to field. 


Structure of the RFCD Classification 


5. The classification is arranged in a hierarchical structure. It has 24 divisions, 139 disciplines and 898 subjects. 


6. The divisions are: 


210000 - Science - General 

220000 - Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts - General 
230000 - Mathematical Sciences 

240000 - Physical Sciences 

250000 - Chemical Sciences 

260000 - Earth Sciences 

270000 - Biological Sciences 

280000 - Information, Computing and Communication Sciences 
290000 - Engineering and Technology 

300000 - Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences 
310000 - Architecture, Urban Environment and Building 
320000 - Medical and Health Sciences 

330000 - Education 

340000 - Economics 

350000 - Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services 
360000 - Policy and Political Science 

370000 - Studies in Human Society 

380000 - Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences 

390000 - Law, Justice and Law Enforcement 

400000 - Journalism, Librarianship and Curatorial Studies 
410000 - The Arts 

420000 - Language and Culture 

430000 - History and Archaeology 

440000 - Philosophy and Religion 

7. Divisions, disciplines and subjects are each assigned a six-digit code. Divisions are uniquely identified by the first two digits and the 
remainder of the code is zero filled. Disciplines are uniquely identified by the first four digits and the remainder of the code is zero filled. Each 
subject has an unique six-digit code. 


8. There are ninety-nine possible categories at the discipline and subject levels, to allow for future expansion of the classification. 


Guidelines for classifying by RFCD 
9. The following general procedures are aimed to ensure consistent and successful classification. 


10. A research project or course is to be allocated to a RFCD subject in a hierarchical manner. This is achieved by first determining the 
division in which the research is being performed, then the most relevant discipline within that division and then the most relevant subject 
within that discipline. 


11. It is vital to firstly identify the higher level classifications as some subjects, although within different disciplines, have identical titles. 
12. There are two ‘general’ divisions (210000 Science - General and 220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts - General) and one 


‘general’ discipline (320100 Medicine - General) to enable classification of areas of study which cannot be allocated to more specific 
categories. 


Relationship with other classifications 


13. The RFCD classification has been designed primarily to meet the needs of the ABS and the Department of Employment, Education, 
Training and Youth Affairs for classifying courses and research projects to field of study/research and classifying units of study to discipline. It 
will replace the Field of Research (FOR) classification, included in the 1993 edition of the ASRC, and the Field of Study Classification of 
Higher Education Courses (FOSCHEC). 


14. Other classifications which are related to fields of study are: 


the ABS Classification of Qualifications (ABSCQ) which, although primarily designed as a classification of qualifications already obtained, 
may also be used to classify educational courses which lead to these qualifications; 


the Field of Study Classification of Tertiary Education Courses (FOSCTEC) which is based on FOSCHEC with some minor variations to 
meet the needs of the vocational education and training sector; and 


the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) which is a classification of educational programmes rather than 
qualifications. 


15. The ABS is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the ABSCQ with the aim of replacing it with an Australian Standard 
Classification of Education (ASCED). The review will be completed by late 1999. The ASCED will be consistent with the RFCD with additional 


categories to cover uniquely vocational education and training sector activities. 


16. For further information, or advice on the relationship between these classifications, contact the Director, Classifications and Data 
Standards Section, ABS on (02) 6252 6300. 


17. Three major field of research classifications are: 


e the OECD Fields of Science and Technology Classification, a two level classification incorporated into the fifth revision of the OECD 
Proposed Standard Practice for Surveys of Research and Experimental Development, Frascati Manual; 


e the European Economic Community (EEC) Sciences Classification, a three level classification used within certain member countries of 
the EEC, particularly in Belgium; and 


e the US National Science Foundation (NSF) Classification, a two level classification used by that Foundation in the measurement of 
national science indicators. 


18. For advice on the relationship between these classifications and the RFCD, contact the Assistant Director, Research and Development 
Statistics, ABS on (02) 6252 5627.

Nature and purpose of the SEO classification 


Page tools: a!) Print Page 


About this Release 


Contents 


1. The SEO Classification allows R&D data to be classified according to the researcher's perceived purpose. The purpose categories take 
account of processes, products, health, education and other social and environmental aspects of particular interest. 


2. A purpose classification such as the SEO provides a set of categories which collectively exhaust all the objectives of research. In this 
respect, the scope of the SEO is more extensive than a classification of economic activities such as the Australian and New Zealand Standard 
Industrial Classification (ANZSIC), because not all R&D has an economic motive or context. 


Structure of the SEO classification 


3. The SEO Classification is arranged in a hierarchical structure. It has 5 divisions, 18 subdivisions, 107 groups and 594 classes. 


4. The divisions and subdivisions are: 


Division 1 - Defence 
Subdivision 610000 Defence 


Division 2 - Economic Development 
Subdivision 620000 Plant Production and Plant Primary Products 


Subdivision 630000 Animal Production and Animal Primary Products 
Subdivision 640000 Mineral Resources (Excl. Energy) 

Subdivision 650000 Energy Resources 

Subdivision 660000 Energy Supply 

Subdivision 670000 Manufacturing 

Subdivision 680000 Construction 

Subdivision 690000 Transport 


Subdivision 700000 Information and Communication Services 
Subdivision 710000 Commercial Services and Tourism 
Subdivision 720000 Economic Framework 


Division 3 - Society 
Subdivision 730000 Health 
Subdivision 740000 Education and Training 
Subdivision 750000 Social Development and Community Services 


Division 4 - Environment 
Subdivision 760000 Environmental Policy Frameworks and other aspects 
Subdivision 770000 Environmental Management 


Division 5 - Non-Oriented Research 
Subdivision 780000 Non-Oriented Research 


5. Subdivisions, groups and classes are all assigned six-digit codes. Subdivisions are uniquely identified by the first two digits and the 
remainder of the code is zero filled. Groups are uniquely identified by the first four digits and the remainder of the code is zero filled. Classes 
have unique six-digit codes. 


6. There are ninety-nine possible categories at the subdivision, group and class levels to allow for future expansion of the classification. The 
divisions are not reflected in the code system at the subdivision or finer levels. 


Guidelines for classifying R&D by SEO 
7. The following general procedures are aimed to ensure consistent and successful classification of R&D data. 


8. A Research Project is to be allocated to a class in a hierarchical manner. This is achieved by first determining the SEO division in which the 
research is being performed, then the most relevant subdivision within that division, then the most relevant group within that subdivision, and 
finally by selecting the relevant class within a chosen group. 


9. It is vital to firstly identify the higher level classifications for the Research Project as some classes, although within different groups, have 
identical class titles. 


10. In general, a Research Project is to be classified to one class only. There are cases however where a large Research Project is directed 
towards more than one socio-economic objective. In such cases, the aim should be to allocate R&D resources on a proportional basis. 


11. Where a defined class cannot be identified within a group for a Research Project, the 'Other' or 'n.e.c.' category at the class level is to be 
used. 


Relationship between the SEO classification and the ANZSIC 


12. In studying industry performance, it is possible to compare trends in industry with the levels of R&D directed towards particular industries. 
ABS statistics have been compiled according to the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC). 


13. A broad comparison with the ANZSIC categories is shown below. 


SEO ANZSIC 


Defence Subdivision 82 - Defence 
Economic Development Division A - Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting 


Division B - Mining 

Division C - Manufacturing 

Division D - Electricity, Gas and Water Supply 

Division E - Construction 

Division F - Wholesale Trade 

Division G - Retail Trade 

Division H - Accommodation, Cafes and Restaurants 

Division | - Transport and Storage 

Division J - Communication Services 

Division K - Finance and Insurance 

Division L - Property and Business Services 
Society Subdivision 81 - Government Administration 

Division N - Education 

Division O - Health and Community Services 

Division P - Cultural and Recreational Services 

Subdivision 96 - Other Services 
Environment na. 
Non-Oriented Research na. 


14. The ANZSIC is a classification of industries. Business units reporting data to a range of ABS censuses and surveys are classified to the 
ANZSIC on the basis of their predominant economic activity (e.g. what they do to generate income). Normally income is generated through 
the sale of goods and services produced by the business or bought in from other businesses. An industry as represented in ABS statistics is 
made up of businesses which are classified to it in accordance with the ANZSIC. 


15. When comparing R&D data classified by the SEO with industrial statistics based on the ANZSIC, there are some important considerations 


to be noted: 


e Classifying to an SEO category is subjective, i.e. the category is chosen by the data provider to indicate the main purpose of R&D. 
Classifying a business to an industry is generally derived objectively through information about its main income generating activity. 


e SEO categories do not always correspond with ANZSIC categories on a one to one basis and do not also necessarily correspond with 
identifiable target industries. For example where the environment is the main potential beneficiary of the R&D, there is no set of business 
units equivalent and therefore no ANZSIC class is applicable. 


e Some SEO categories are too broad and cannot be correlated to ANZSIC industries. For example, R&D towards improving road safety 
has potential benefits to a wide range of industries, community services and individuals. There would be some effect on businesses within 
the transport industry, but this may be incidental to attempts at generally reducing the burden on emergency services, medical services, 
insurance services, disability services, police services, legal services, etc. 


e The nature of R&D is such that there may be no observable effect on ABS industry level statistics, or at least the effect may be difficult to 
assess. The positive effects of R&D may be concealed at the aggregate industry level because of variation, for a variety of reasons, in 


data from establishments in the same industry. Additionally, in particular instances, R&D may not lead to initiatives which proceed beyond 
the test environment.

Definitions 
Division 5 - Non-Oriented Research, covers R&D which contributes to the general advancement of knowledge. This division should only be 
used when no specific purpose under any of the other divisions can be identified. 


This division can only include R&D which is ‘pure basic research’; i.e. R&D efforts which are undertaken to acquire new knowledge without 
any specific application or looking for long term benefits other than the advancement of knowledge. It has only one group.
