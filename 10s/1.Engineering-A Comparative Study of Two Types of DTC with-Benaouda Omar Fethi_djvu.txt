We  present  in  this  paper  the  simulation  results  of  the  speed  control  of  a  3  levels  inverter  fed  induction  machine 
controlled  by  the  Direct  Torque  Control  with  application  of  artificial  intelligence  techniques  both  the  fuzzy  logic 
(DTC_FL)  and  the  neural  network  (DTC_NN).  A  comparative  study  of  these  two  techniques  is  also  presented  to  illustrate 
the  merits  of  each  of  the  techniques  on  the  performance  of  the  3 -levels  inverter-/induction  machine  set. 

KEYWORDS:  Induction  Machine,  3-Levels  Inverter,  Direct  Torque  Control  (DTC),  DTC_FL,  DTC_NN 

INTRODUCTION 

The  technique  of  direct  torque  control  (DTC)  introduced  in  1985  by  Takahashi  [1,  2]  is  a  seductive  approach  due 
to  its  effectiveness  on  one  hand  and  its  simplicity  of  implementation  on  the  other  hand.  Several  works  have  enabled 
rigorous  modeling  approach  [2,  3],  that  is  based  on  a  pulse  width  modulation  feeding  and  on  the  decoupling  between  the 
flux  and  torque  of  the  motor  by  the  magnetic  field  orientation  [4].  The  techniques  of  fuzzy  logic  and  artificial  neural 
network  will  also  be  introduced  and  used  for  performance  improvement  of  classical  DTC.  The  model  is  then  simulated  on 
a  Matlab/Simulink  environment.

The  voltage  vector  Vs  supplied  by  the  three-phase  voltage  inverter  source  is  shown  in  Figure  1  by  using 
3  Boolean  control  variables  Sj  (j  =  a,  b,  c)  such  that: 

•  Sj  (j  =  a,  b,  c)  =1 :  High  Switch  ON  and  Low  Switch  OFF. 

•  Sj  (j  =  a,  b,  c)  =0:  High  Switch  OFF  and  Low  Switch  ON.

The  voltage  vector  V s  can  be  written  as: 
Vs  =  4in>UQ[Sa  +  Sbe^  +  Sce^~]

Combinations  of  the  3  values  (Sa,  Sb,  Sc)  are  used  to  generate  8  positions  of  the  vector  V  s  ,  where  2  zero  vectors 
correspond  to:  (Sa,  Sb,  Sc)  =  [(000)  or  (111)]  as  shown  in  Figure  I. 

FLUX  AND  TORQUE  CONTROL 

From  (1),  it  can  be  written  that:

to  the  voltage  Vs .  In  a  time  interval  Te,  the  end  of  the  vector  (ps  moves  on  a  straight  line  whose  direction  is  given  by  the 

vector  Vs,  Figure  2.  By  choosing  the  correct  sequence  of  vectors  Vs  on  successive  time  intervals  of  duration  Te, 

one  can  follow  at  the  end  of  the  vector,  the  desired  trajectory.  To  achieve  this  goal,  the  corrector  used  for  the  DTC  is  a  two 
levels  hysteresis  corrector.  With  this  type  of  corrector,  one  can  easily  hold  the  end  of  the  flux  vector  in  an  almost  circular 
shape. 


Figure  2:  Evolution  of  the  End  of  the  Vector  q>s 

The  variations  of  the  electromagnetic  torque  can  be  controlled  only  from  the  rotational  speed  of  the  flux  vector. 
Table  1  shows  the  evolution  of  both  flux  and  torque  magnitudes  for  each  of  the  four  vectors  Vi+i,  Vi+2,  Vm,  Vi_2,  which  can 
be  applied  in  the  zone  Z^  The  voltage  vectors  to  be  applied  depend  on  the  region  where  the  flux  vector  is  located. 
The  parameters  Zb  Z2,  Z3  Z4,  Z5,  Z6  represent  the  six  possible  zones  of  operation.

SELECTION  OF  THE  VOLTAGE  VECTOR  Vs 

The  choice  of  the  vector  vs  depends  on  the  location  of  the  (ps  in  the  referential  (S),  on  the  desired  variation  of  the 

module  (ps ,  on  the  desired  variation  torque  and  on  the  direction  of  rotation  of  (ps  .  The  evolution  space  of  <ps  in  (S)  is 
divided  into  twelve  space  areas  i,  with  i  =  [1,  12],  Figure  3.

THE  ELABORATION  OF  CORRECTORS 
3-Level  Flux  Corrector 

The  purpose  of  the  flux  corrector  is  to  maintain  the  end  of  the  vector  flux  <psin  a  circular  mesh  [1]. 

The  output  of  the  hysteresis  corrector,  as  represented  by  a  variable  boolienne  indicates  directly  whether  the  amplitude  of 
the  flux  should  be  increased  or  decreased  (Cflx=-1,  Cflx=0,  Cflx=+1). 

5-Level  Torque  Corrector 

The  torque  corrector  has  as  objective  to  maintain  the  torque  within  the  limits  |Cr6f  -Cem|<  AC) ,  with  Cr6fthe 
torque  reference  and  AC  the  hysteresis  band  of  the  corrector  couple  function.  However  a  difference  with  the  flux  control  is

that  the  torque  can  be  positive  or  negative  depending  on  the  rotation  direction  of  the  machine.  To  improve  torque  control, 
the  torque  error  AC  is  associated  with  five  regions  defined  by  the  following  constraints:

The  control  torque  is  provided  by  a  hysteresis   comparator  with   five   levels   or  two   upper  bands 
(AC    t,AC    ~)and  two  lower  bands  (AC    ,,AC    Jas  illustrated  in  Figure  5,  and  also  its  outputs  which  are

Fuzzy  logic  is  a  method  of  treatment  of  uncertainties  and  is  intended  for  the  representation  of  imprecise 
knowledge.  It  is  based  on  current  linguistic  terms  such  as:  small,  large,  medium  etc.  It  allows  intermediate  values  between 
right  and  wrong  and  admits  overlap  between  them  [6] .

Figure  13:  Stator  Current  of  Phase  a ,  Case:  (DTC_LF) 

COMPARATIVE  STUDY  BETWEEN  THE  TWO  CONTROLS  METHODS  DTNC  AND  DTCLF 

Simulation  results  show  that  the  performance  obtained  by  DTCLF  control  is  significantly  better  than  those 
obtained  by  DTNC  control.  It  is  interesting  to  note  in  Figure  11a  dynamic  torque  response  with  a  slow  transient. 
The  stator  flux  in  DTCLF,  Figure  12,  has  a  very  good  response  and  we  can  see  a  slight  excess  in  comparison  to  DTNC, 
see  Figure  9.  Figure  12  also  shows  a  fast  transient  of  stator  flux  module  in  a  perfectly  circular  with  no  ripples  in  the  steady 
state,  and  this  is  reflected  in  the  torque  and  flux  quantities. 

CONCLUSIONS 

The  Benefits  of  DTNC_12S  Control  are 

•  The  torque  is  well  controlled. 

•  The  flux  and  torque  follow  perfectly  their  references. 

•  The  stator  current  is  sinusoidal. 
The  DTNC  Has  Three  Major  Problems 

•  The  flux  is  established  slowly. 

•  The  switching  frequency  is  variable  around  3kHz. 

•  The  problem  of  the  choice  of  the  learning. 
The  Benefits  of  DTC_LF  Command  are 

•  The  flux  and  torque  are  well  controlled 

•  The  constant  switching  frequency  around  4kHz 
The  DTC_LF  Presents  a  Major  Problem 

•  The  switching  frequency  can  be  a  little  high
