Appendix:  Exhibit  Checklist 


Foreword 


The  Library  of  Congress  has  recently  sponsored 
exhibitions  highlighting  treasures  from  two  of  the  worlds 
major  libraries:  the  Vatican  Library  in  Rome  and  the 
Bibliotheque  Nationale  de  France  in  Paris.  Now,  the 
Library  is  privileged  to  display  treasures  from  the  Saxon 
State  Library  (Sachsische  Landesbibliothek)  in 
Dresden,  Germany. 

Located  on  the  Elbe  River  in  central  Europe,  Dresden 
was  founded  in  the  thirteenth  century.  It  was  the  seat  of 
the  Saxon  rulers  beginning  in  the  fifteenth  century  and 
is  currently  the  capital  of  the  German  Free  State  of  Saxony. 
Because  of  its  pivotal  role  in  the  late  Renaissance  and 
the  Protestant  Reformation  in  Germany,  Dresden  is  known 
as  the  German  Florence  or  the  Florence  of  the  North. 

During  the  first  half  of  the  eighteenth  century,  under 
the  rulers  August  I  (Augustus  the  Strong)  and  his  son 
August  II,  Saxony  reached  the  pinnacle  of  its  cultural  influ¬ 
ence,  manifested  in  the  spectacular  baroque  architecture 
of  the  capital  city.  Dresden  became  a  major  European  cul¬ 
tural  center,  where  monarchs  fostered  the  arts  and  made 
significant  additions  to  the  city’s  art,  museum,  and  library 
collections,  which  attracted  many  European  travelers. 

One  of  Dresden’s  outstanding  cultural  institutions 
is  the  Saxon  State  Library,  which  is  now  celebrating  its  four 
hundred  fortieth  anniversary.  The  Library  of  Congress 
is  pleased  to  collaborate  with  the  Saxon  State  Library 
to  display  a  selection  of  its  treasures.  These  collections  were 
unavailable  and  largely  unknown  to  two  generations 
of  Americans,  since  Dresden  fell  within  the  former  Soviet 
bloc  after  1945.  The  idea  for  this  exhibition  originated 
in  1992,  shortly  after  the  collapse  of  communism,  when 
I  had  the  opportunity  to  visit  the  Saxon  State  Library. 

In  1978  the  National  Gallery  of  Art  mounted  an 
exhibition,  “The  Splendor  of  Dresden,”  emphasizing  the 


magnificent  art  treasures  of  Saxony.  The  present  exhibition 
focuses  for  the  first  time  on  Saxony’s  equally  rich  and 
valuable  literary  heritage.  Displayed  here  are  examples 
from  the  full  range  of  treasures  in  rhe  Saxon  State 
Library — manuscripts,  incunabula,  books,  music  manu¬ 
scripts,  photographs,  maps,  and  paintings — forming 
an  anthology  from  the  High  Middle  Ages  through  the 
nineteenth  century. 

The  exhibition  and  this  accompanying  catalog  are  the 
result  of  four  years  of  collaboration  and  planning  between 
the  Saxon  State  Library  and  the  Library  of  Congress.  I 
would  especially  like  to  acknowledge  the  efforts  of  Margrit 
B.  Krewson,  the  Library’s  German/Dutch  area  specialist, 
for  her  organizational  skills  as  well  as  her  initiative  in 
raising  the  necessary  funds  to  make  the  exhibition  and 
catalog  possible. 

The  Library  of  Congress  displays  these  treasures 
from  the  Saxon  State  Library  as  part  of  its  mission 
to  make  the  resources  of  the  world’s  more  readily  known 
to  the  American  public.  We  are  indeed  privileged  with 
the  loan  of  these  treasures  from  Dresden,  most  of  which 
have  never  been  exhibited  outside  the  Saxon  State 
Library.  We  are  pleased  to  be  able  thus  to  call  attention 
to  the  rich  European  heritage  preserved  in  Dresden.

Editor’s  Preface 


This  catalog,  which  accompanies  the  exhibit  “Dresden: 
Treasures  from  the  Saxon  State  Library,”  is  presented  to  the 
American  public  as  an  introduction  to  the  rich  literary, 
musical,  and  religious  history  of  Dresden  collections  and 
libraries.  A  series  of  essays  written  by  the  professional  staff 
of  the  Saxon  State  Library  (Sachsische  Landesbibliothek) 
includes  a  history  of  the  Saxon  State  Library  from  its 
beginnings  as  a  court  library  to  its  current  role  as  the  state 
library  of  Saxony  and  one  of  the  preeminent  libraries  in 
Germany  (Wolfgang  Frtihauf);  an  overview  of  the  history 
of  Saxony,  with  particular  emphasis  on  the  ruling  Wettin 
family  and  its  political  and  cultural  ambitions  (Reinhardt 
Eigenwill);  an  explanation  of  the  origin  and  role  of  the 
Protestant  Reformation  in  Saxony  (Christian  Ziihlke); 
a  discussion  of  the  role  of  Dresden  in  the  development 
of  literature  during  the  Romantic  period  at  the  beginning 
of  the  nineteenth  century  (Hans-Jiirgen  Sarfert);  and 
an  account  of  the  rich  musical  heritage  of  Saxony,  much 
of  which  is  preserved  in  the  Saxon  State  Library  (Ortrun 
Landmann). 

This  exhibit  could  not  have  been  realized  without  the 
support  of  Suzanne  Thorin  and  the  scholarly  guidance  of

The  History  of  the  Saxon  State  Library 


The  Saxon  State  Library,  the  Sachsische  Landesbibliothek, 
had  its  origins  in  the  mid-sixteenth  century,  during  the 
reign  of  Prince  Elector  August  (ruled  1553-86).  At  that 
time,  Saxony  was  the  second-largest  German  state  after  the 
powerful  Habsburg  Empire,  a  position  resulting  primarily 
from  the  shrewd  policies  pursued  by  its  princes  and 
its  great  mineral  wealth.  Prince  August,  who  lacked  great 
military  ambitions,  concentrated  his  statesmanship  on 
promoting  the  economy — especially  mining,  trade,  agricul¬ 
ture,  and  forestry — and  fostering  the  arts  and  sciences. 
This  well-educated  prince  found  his  learned  books  becom¬ 
ing  more  and  more  indispensable,  and  in  1556  he  began 
to  acquire  literary  works  systematically.  This  was  the 
beginning  of  the  Dresden  Court  Library. 


The  Private  Library  of  the  Prince  Elector  of  Saxony 

The  new  collection  grew  quite  rapidly  as  Prince  August 
personally  perused  the  catalogs  from  the  Leipzig  book  fair, 
went  abroad  on  acquisition  trips,  and  even  commissioned 
diplomats  to  buy  books  for  him.  His  love  of  books  is 
illustrated  not  only  by  his  meticulous  selections  but  also 
by  the  splendid  bindings  he  obtained  from  the  atelier 
of  Jakob  Krause,  the  most  important  German  bookbinder 


during  the  Renaissance.  Prince  August  summoned  Krause 
to  Dresden  from  Augsburg,  where  the  bookbinder  had 
already  demonstrated  his  mastery  of  the  trade  at  the  court 
of  the  Fuggers,  a  wealthy  dynasty  of  merchant  princes. 

The  bindings  Krause  made  for  Prince  August,  partially 
made  of  white  parchment  and  pigskin  or  costly  calfskin, 
bore  the  coat  of  arms,  insignia,  and  often  the  portrait 
of  this  Renaissance  prince. 

When  Prince  August  died  in  1586,  he  left  behind 
a  well-balanced  library  that  included  a  collection  of 
10.  modern  and  foreign  literature.  As  a  collector,  he  was  most 

interested  in  modern  printed  works.  He  also  collected 
manuscripts,  incunabula,  and  maps.  None  of  these 
treasures  originated  from  Saxon  monasteries,  which  had 
once  been  the  only  centers  of  book  learning  in  Saxony. 
When  the  monasteries  were  dissolved  after  the  introduc¬ 
tion  of  Protestantism  as  the  official  state  religion  in  the 
first  half  of  the  sixteenth  century,  the  University  of  Leipzig 
(founded  1409),  was  the  chief  beneficiary,  although  some 
Saxon  private  schools  also  received  books  from  the  monas¬ 
teries.  Instead,  Prince  August’s  acquisitions  were  mostly 
purchased.  Next  to  each  other  on  his  bookshelves  stood 
Catholic  and  Lutheran  writings,  although  Calvinist  books, 
partly  because  of  their  authors  and  partly  because  of  their 
“erroneous  doctrines,”  were  kept  elsewhere — just  one  indi¬ 
cation  of  the  religious  troubles  of  the  time.  The  dismissal 
of  the  librarian  Leonhard,  accused  of  being  a  Calvinist, 
offers  another  illustration  of  religious  conflict  in  Saxony. 

By  the  end  of  the  sixteenth  century,  the  electors,  who 
followed  one  another  in  rapid  succession,  were  no  longer 
personally  selecting  books,  and  the  library  became  the 
responsibility  of  the  senior  court  chaplains.  By  1595  the 
collection  numbered  5,668  monographs  and  91  maps  and 
copper  engravings.  After  this  date  the  library’s  growth 
slowed  markedly  because  of  the  Thirty  Years’  War,  which 
brought  rising  prices,  misery,  and  plague. 

During  the  splendid  reign  of  Johann  Georg  II  (ruled 
1656-80)  conditions  in  the  library  improved.  For  the  first 
time  the  electoral  household  and  the  court  chaplains,  as 
well  as  the  elector’s  family,  had  access  to  the  private  library, 
though  the  household  and  chaplains  could  use  it  only 
by  permission  of  the  elector.  This  was  the  first  step  toward 
establishment  of  a  public  library. 


The  Golden  Age 

In  the  eighteenth  century  the  collection  flourished, 
becoming  the  preeminent  German  library.  This  golden  age 
began  with  the  reign  of  Prince  Friedrich  August  I  (ruled 
1694-1733),  who  also  became  king  of  Poland  in  1697  and 
who  is  generally  known  as  August  the  Strong. 

The  new  era  had  an  inauspicious  start  with  the 
burning  of  the  residential  palace  in  Dresden  in  1701. 
Because  of  the  damage  to  the  castle,  the  library  and  other 
collections  had  to  be  moved  to  new,  cramped  quarters. 
King  August  summoned  to  his  court  talented  architects, 
artists,  craftsmen,  and  inventors,  among  them  the  “gold 
maker,”  Johann  Friedrich  Bottger,  the  creator  of  European 
porcelain.  He  also  established  numerous  factories,  which 
led  to  economic  growth  and  made  the  court  at  Dresden 
the  most  splendid  in  Europe,  after  Versailles.  He  further 
expanded  the  royal  collections,  which  he  caused  to 
be  arranged  by  subject  and  made  accessible  to  the  public 
for  the  first  time. 

Thanks  to  increased  financial  support,  the  library 
was  transformed.  Manuscripts,  maps,  and  valuable  prints 
from  other  parts  of  the  collection  were  added  to  it,  and  by 
1727  it  received  additional  space  in  two  wings  of  the 
Zwinger.  This  collection  of  buildings,  which  is  universally 
considered  to  be  the  best  example  of  Dresden  baroque 
architecture,  was  conceived  as  a  court  festival  ground  with 
an  orangery,  fountains,  covered  walks,  and  dining  rooms. 

The  library  had  received  many  new  acquisitions  even 
before  its  move  to  the  Zwinger,  and  the  cataloging  and 
use  of  the  collections  had  expanded.  Saxony  was  reveling 
in  bibliophilia  at  that  time,  and  literary  history  and  bibli¬ 
ography  had  become  fashionable.  Book  publishing  and 
collecting  had  reached  their  zenith.  Court  and  state 
officials  rapidly  built  magnificent  book  collections,  with 
the  wealthy  bourgeoisie  trailing  only  slightly  behind 
the  nobility.  The  Court  Library  later  purchased  many 
of  these  private  collections,  some  of  the  most  important 
of  which  greatly  raised  its  prestige.  For  example,  in 
1736,  under  the  successor  to  August  the  Strong,  Prince 
Friedrich  August  II  (ruled  1733-63),  the  library  acquired 
the  collection  of  Johann  von  Besser  (1654-1729),  a  poet 
and  high  court  official.  This  collection  of  18,000  volumes 


Dresden:  Treasures  from  the  Saxon  State  Library 


was  especially  strong  in  politics,  history,  and  court 
ceremony  and  included  objets  d’art  and  curiosities,  which 
were  very  popular  in  private  libraries  of  the  era. 

An  extremely  rare  item  was  added  to  the  library  in 
1734.  Johann  Christian  Gotze,  a  court  chaplain  who  had 
been  appointed  chief  inspector  of  the  Court  Library, 
acquired  an  illustrated  manuscript  on  a  trip  to  Vienna:  one 
of  only  three  extant  Maya  manuscripts.  Today  the  Codex 
Dresdensis,  as  it  is  called,  is  the  only  one  of  the  three 
being  publicly  exhibited. 

Large  acquisitions,  such  as  the  Besser  collection,  were 
followed  by  extensive  cataloging.  Friedrich  August  II,  like 
his  father  a  passionate  collector,  wanted  rapid  recataloging 
of  the  entire  collection  after  he  acquired  the  Besser 
library — a  demand  that  temporarily  stopped  all  lending. 
Card  catalogs  and  manuscript  and  map  inventories  were 
all  updated.  In  addition,  all  illustrations  and  maps  of  cities 
and  fortresses  available  in  print  were  cataloged.  These 
improvements  increased  the  use  of  the  library,  which  was 
kept  open  several  hours  a  day.  In  1753  the  library  began 
keeping  a  patrons’  ledger,  although  only  distinguished 
names  were  entered  into  it. 

The  Seven  Years’  War  (1756-63)  once  again  interrupted 
the  growth  of  the  Court  Library.  After  the  court  and 
government  had  taken  refuge  in  Warsaw  and  elsewhere, 
the  Prussians  in  1760  took  Dresden  by  bombardment, 
destroying  large  sections  of  the  city.  The  librarian  saved 
the  precious  book  collections  by  storing  them  in  the 
vaults  of  the  fortress. 

By  1765  there  was  still  no  sign  of  economic  recovery. 
Nevertheless,  the  Court  Library  in  that  year  purchased 
the  collection  of  Count  Heinrich  von  Biinau  (1697-1762), 
which  comprised  42,000  volumes  and  was  one  of  the  most 
important  scholarly  libraries  in  Germany.  Bunau’s  passion 
for  book  collecting  had  been  kindled  by  working  on  a 
history  of  the  German  empire.  The  last  volumes  were  never 
completed  because  of  the  war  and  Bunau’s  premature 
death.  His  library  was  noteworthy  for  its  systematic  classifi¬ 
cation  and  cataloging  system,  to  which  Johann  Joachim 
Winckelmann,  founder  of  classical  archaeology,  had 
contributed.  The  logic  of  that  system  is  said  to  have  moti¬ 
vated  Winckelmann  to  develop  his  famous  systematization, 
or  periodization,  of  antiquities,  which  was  the  hallmark 


of  his  later  magnum  opus.  It  is  due  to  Bunau’s  historical 
interests  that  large  numbers  of  pamphlets  from  the  period 
of  the  Thirty  Years’  War  and  many  funeral  orations  have 
been  preserved  as  historical  sources. 

Four  years  later,  the  even  more  comprehensive  62,000- 
volume  library  of  the  late  Saxon  prime  minister,  Count 
Heinrich  von  Briihl  (1700-63),  was  acquired  for  50,000 
talers  (10,000  more  than  was  paid  for  Bunau’s).  The  costly 
purchase  underscores  the  Court  Library’s  stature  as  a 
cultural  institution,  because  at  that  time  the  treasury  was 
very  short  of  funds.  If  one  considers  that  the  priceless  and 
coveted  painting  collection  confiscated  from  the  same 
estate  had  been  auctioned  off  to  the  Russian  tsarina,  the 
purchase  of  Bruhl’s  library  becomes  even  more  significant. 
Even  during  a  time  of  poverty,  the  economic  advantages 
expected  from  promoting  scholarship  were  judged 
sufficient  to  justify  the  high  cost  of  this  book  collection. 

The  collections  of  the  two  counts,  Biinau  and  Briihl, 
complemented  each  other  nicely.  While  the  scholarly 
Biinau  had  limited  his  acquisitions  to  expensive  folios, 
incunabula,  manuscripts,  or  other  rare  items  in  support 
of  his  research,  Briihl  focused  his  passion  for  collecting 
on  the  arts,  attempting  to  acquire  everything  that 
was  aesthetically  pleasing,  costly,  and  rare.  His  collection 
of  old  foreign-language  novels  and  plays  was  said 
to  be  the  most  comprehensive  in  Europe. 

Johann  Michael  Francke  (1717-75),  Biinau’s  librarian 
and  a  colleague  of  Winckelmann,  accompanied  the  collec¬ 
tion  and  became  a  staff  member  of  the  Court  Library, 
where  he  continued  his  pioneering  work  in  cataloging. 

He  advocated  keeping  the  Biinau  library  intact  and 
separate  from  the  Court  Library.  However,  his  advice  went 
unheeded,  and  he  was  forced  to  integrate  Bunau’s  into 
the  collections  of  the  Court  Library. 

By  this  time  the  collections  had  grown  enormously 
in  size,  and  emphasis  was  now  placed  on  balancing  con¬ 
tent,  especially  in  the  area  of  early  editions.  In  1773 
the  Court  Library  acquired  the  1460  Gutenberg  edition 
of  the  Catholicon.  Additional  efforts  resulted  in  transfers 
of  rare  items  from  Saxon  private  schools  that  had  received 
fragmented  collections  from  monastic  libraries.  Among 
these  books  were  many  fragile  early  editions,  such  as 
Fust  and  Schoffer’s  Mainz  Psalterium  (1457),  twenty-six 


The  History  of  the  Saxon  State  Library 


incunabula  from  Chemnitz,  and  another  twenty-four  from 
Schneeberg.  Thus,  rhe  Court  Library  gradually  became 
the  state  depository.  In  1822  the  chief  librarian,  Friedrich 
Adolf  Ebert  (1791-1834),  wrote:  “Since  the  time  of  Friedrich 
August  I  the  Court  Library  has  been  a  true  state  library 
for  Saxony  and,  as  such,  has  preserved  many  things  for  the 
Fatherland,  about  which  Saxony  would  boast  abroad.” 

It  soon  became  evident  that  the  number  of  acquisi¬ 
tions  would  soon  cause  the  Court  Library  to  outgrow  the 
space  within  the  Zwinger.  The  elaborate  Japanese  Palace, 
after  extensive  renovation,  became  its  new  home  in  1786. 
The  newly  appointed  chief  librarian,  Johann  Christoph 
Adelung  (1786-1806),  renamed  the  institution  the  Electoral 
Public  Library  (Kurfiirstliche  Offentliche  Bibliothek), 
and  when  Saxony  became  a  kingdom  in  1806,  it  became 
the  Royal  Public  Library.  Adelung,  a  scholar  and  also  an 
able  administrator,  further  enhanced  the  collections  by 
acquiring  important  Old  German  manuscripts,  such  as  an 
illuminated  copy  of  the  Sachsenspiegel  (a  medieval  legal 
code  written  by  Eike  von  Repgow),  and  other  unique  mate¬ 
rials,  such  as  a  collection  of  3,500  university  dissertations. 

Such  a  collection  of  literary  treasures  appealed  to  intel¬ 
lectuals  such  as  Johann  Christoph  Friedrich  von  Schiller, 
Johann  Gottfried  von  Herder,  and  Heinrich  von  Kleist,  all 
of  whom  made  use  of  the  library.  Similarly,  many  European 
travelers  visited  the  collections  in  the  Japanese  Palace, 
as  did  several  rulers,  such  as  Kaiser  Leopold  II  of  Austria, 
King  Friedrich  Wilhelm  II  of  Prussia,  and  Napoleon. 

The  significant  reduction  of  the  Saxon  territory 
decreed  by  the  Congress  of  Vienna  in  1815  weakened  the 
kingdom  both  politically  and  economically,  with  serious 
consequences  for  the  budget  and  development  of  the  Royal 
Public  Library.  By  1834  it  was  evident  that  the  Royal  Public 
Library  with  its  300,000  volumes  had  been  surpassed 
in  size  by  the  Bavarian  Court  Library,  and  in  contemporary 
literature  its  collection  was  inferior  to  that  of  the 
University  of  Gottingen. 

The  Library  Takes  a  New  Direction 

Although  the  Dresden  library  no  longer  surpassed  other 
libraries  in  expanding  its  collections,  it  remained  a  leader 


in  librarianship.  Such  Dresden  chief  librarians  as  Friedrich 
Adolf  Ebert  (1791-1834)  and  Ernst  Forstemann  (1865-87) 
gained  national  recognition  by  encouraging  bibliography 
and  librarianship.  As  early  as  1816  the  Royal  Public  Library 
had  become  a  pioneer  of  modern  library  administration, 
when  it  established  one  of  the  first  music  departments  in 
a  German  library,  and  by  1835  it  installed  cases  for  display¬ 
ing  library  treasures  to  the  public.  A  century  later  the 
space  devoted  to  the  display  of  library  treasures  had  grown 
into  a  book  museum  of  several  rooms. 

By  the  middle  of  the  nineteenth  century,  as  a  result 
of  the  sharp  increase  in  book  production,  the  library  was 
no  longer  able  to  collect  universally,  a  practice  that  it  had 
always  promoted  and  defended.  Librarian  Petzholdt  wrote 
in  1843  in  the  Wegweiser  fur  Dresdner  Bibliotheken — 
probably  rhe  first  library  guide  in  Germany — that  one 
of  the  reasons  for  the  gaps  in  the  Royal  Public  Library  was 
insufficient  funds,  but  that  the  ultimate  cause  was  the 
existence  of  specialized  libraries,  such  as  the  Dresden  Poly¬ 
technic  Library.  The  Royal  Library  limited  its  acquisitions 
of  scientific  and  technical  literature — in  spite  of  the  high 
demand  for  such  works — and  stopped  acquiring  medical 
literature  altogether,  since  the  Dresden  Medical  Academy 
Library  had  taken  over  responsibility  for  collecting 
literature  in  this  area. 

With  each  library  assuming  responsibility  for  its 
subject  specialty,  Forstemann,  during  his  tenure  at 
the  Royal  Public  Library,  targeted  the  areas  of  history  and 
its  ancillary  disciplines,  geography,  political  science,  belles 
lettres,  and  art  and  music.  In  history,  geography,  and  local 
history,  the  systematic  acquisition  of  materials  relating 
to  Saxony,  or  Saxonica,  brought  large  numbers  of  Saxon 
chronicles,  family  records,  and  unpublished  works 
into  the  library.  Of  special  significance  was  the  acquisition 
of  a  collection  of  317  original  prints  from  the  period  of 
the  Reformation.  In  1880  the  Royal  Public  Library  became 
one  of  the  first  libraries  in  Germany  to  specialize  in 
the  bibliography  of  regional  studies. 

As  chief  librarian,  Franz  Schnorr  von  Carolsfeld 
(1887-1907)  focused  on  the  printed  music  collection. 
Together  with  the  Saxon  Antiquarian  Association, 
he  perused  the  holdings  of  numerous  Saxon  churches 
and  schools  to  obtain  their  printed  music  collections 


Dresden:  Treasures  from  the  Saxon  State  Library 


for  the  Royal  Public  Library.  These  complemented  the 
royal  private  music  collection  of  4,000  volumes  and  300 
cases  (holding  thousands  of  items) — a  singularly  complete 
archive  of  eighteenth-  and  nineteenth-century  court  music. 
Together  with  the  liturgical  music,  the  manuscript  material 
for  more  than  a  thousand  operas  composed  for  and/or 
performed  at  the  Dresden  court,  in  addition  to  autograph 
scores  by  Johann  Sebastian  Bach,  Carl  Maria  von  Weber, 
Richard  Wagner,  Antonio  Vivaldi,  and  many  other  famous 
composers,  formed  a  unique  music  archive  that  is  still 
heavily  used  by  the  music  industry,  for  example,  in  the 
Dresden  Music  Festival. 

In  the  early  twentieth  century  the  growth  of  the 
library  was  disrupted  by  World  War  I  (1914-18),  inflation, 
and  the  world  economic  crisis.  Book  acquisitions  declined 
dramatically,  and  for  a  time  the  library  was  cut  off  from 
its  foreign  suppliers. 

After  the  Weimar  Republic  was  proclaimed  in  1919, 
the  Royal  Public  Library  and  all  the  former  court  libraries 
were  renamed  the  Saxon  State  Library,  reflecting  the  true 
function  of  the  institution  as  a  central  scholarly  library 
for  the  state  of  Saxony. 

Despite  poor  economic  and  political  conditions, 
library  director  Martin  Bollert  (1920-37)  continued  to 
expand  the  Saxon  State  Library.  He  remodeled  the 
Japanese  Palace  to  increase  use  of  the  collections.  A  frugal 
administrator  in  lean  times,  Bollert  made  the  Saxon  State 
Library  a  model  in  Germany  of  the  modern,  efficient 
research  and  general  library,  at  a  time  when  many  state 
libraries  were  undergoing  an  identity  crisis.  Until 
World  War  II,  the  Saxon  State  Library  ranked  third 
among  German  libraries  in  the  scope  and  size  of  its  special 
collections  and  continued  to  be  a  leader  in  the 
field  of  German  librarianship. 

The  Nazi  Period  and  Its  Aftermath 

National  Socialist  domination  and  World  War  II  put  an 
end  to  the  progress  the  Saxon  State  Library  had  made 
under  Bollert’s  direction.  Bollert  himself  was  not  prepared 
to  conform  to  the  requirements  of  the  Nazi  regime 
and  was  sent  into  early  retirement.  The  few  Jewish  staff 


members  were  forced  to  resign,  and  Jewish  users  of  the 
library  were  forced  to  stay  away  because  the  Nuremberg 
Race  Laws  (1935)  prohibited  them  from  entering 
theaters,  movies,  or  libraries. 

Countless  books  were  also  victims  of  Hitler’s  bar¬ 
barism,  including  those  of  Heinrich  and  Thomas  Mann, 
Bertolt  Brecht,  and  Sigmund  Freud.  Annual  lists  were 
published  of  prohibited  or  undesirable  literature  to  be 
removed  from  the  shelves.  None  of  these  titles  was 
destroyed  at  the  Saxon  State  Library,  but  the  use  of  “unde¬ 
sirable”  books  was  severely  restricted.  Libraries  of  exiled 
or  expatriate  Jewish  citizens  were  considered  undesirable 
acquisitions.  They  were  not  added  to  the  collection  but 
were  kept  separate  from  the  other  books — on  “deposit,” 
as  it  were — until  they  could  be  returned  to  their  owners. 

After  the  war  began  in  1939  the  precious  holdings  of 
old  books  were  moved  to  eighteen  castles  and  offices  in 
the  vicinity  of  Dresden,  where  they  survived  the  war  safely. 
During  the  night  of  13  February  1945,  British  Air  Force 
squadrons  razed  the  inner  city.  The  Japanese  Palace  was 
hit  hard  but  only  partially  destroyed.  On  2  March 
American  bombers  completed  the  work  of  destruction. 

The  results  of  both  air  raids  included  the  death  of  four 
library  employees  while  on  the  nightly  fire  watch,  the  loss 
of  the  magnificent  Japanese  Palace,  and  the  destruction 
of  about  200,000  volumes,  primarily  of  twentieth-century 
literature.  In  addition  there  was  damage  to  the  most  pre¬ 
cious  parts  of  the  collection,  which  had  been  carefully 
stored  in  a  vault  considered  proof  against  fire,  water,  and 
bombs.  The  violence  of  the  bomb  explosions  cracked  the 
thick  walls  of  the  vault,  letting  water  in  to  do  its  destruc¬ 
tive  work  on  priceless  manuscripts  and  old  editions. 

Even  today,  the  library’s  restoration  workshop  is  dealing 
with  the  water  damage  to  preserve  these  treasures  from 
further  disintegration. 

After  the  war,  the  undamaged  collections  stored  in 
the  basement  of  the  Japanese  Palace,  together  with  parts 
of  the  old  collection  that  had  been  evacuated  and  then 
brought  back,  were  housed  in  new  provisional  quarters 
on  the  north  side  of  Dresden,  where  they  have  remained 
to  this  day.

works  dating  from  the  fifteenth  to  the  nineteenth  century, 
as  well  as  the  manuscript  and  map  collections,  and  took 
them  to  the  Soviet  Union.  These  special  collections  had 
remained  in  storage  after  evacuation  due  to  lack  of 
transportation  to  or  space  in  the  library. 

Despite  the  obvious  need  for  haste,  the  cultural 
official  in  charge  of  confiscation,  who  was  also  the  director 
of  the  Moscow  Foreign  Literature  Library,  did  not  proceed 
haphazardly  or  indiscriminately.  The  boxes  that  were 
carried  away  contained  those  parts  of  the  library  collection 
that  would  best  complement  the  holdings  of  Soviet 
libraries,  which  had  been  severely  damaged  in  the  war. 
Consequently,  the  Russians  chose  not  to  take  the  Saxonica 
and  Slavic  collections  of  the  Saxon  State  Library. 

In  an  intergovernmental  agreement,  the  Soviet 
Union  and  the  German  Democratic  Republic  (GDR)  in 
1958  repatriated  the  manuscript  collection  and  the  paint¬ 
ings  of  the  Dresden  Gallery  of  Art.  The  printed  book 
collections,  however,  remained  in  the  Soviet  Union,  and 
their  location  was  concealed  until  the  1980s.  The  GDR 
halted  attempts  to  uncover  the  whereabouts  of  these 
treasures.  Only  after  the  events  of  1989  in  central  and 
eastern  Europe  was  an  agreement  reached  for  the  mutual 
return  of  all  cultural  assets.  In  1993  materials  of  the  Saxon 
State  Library  were  identified  in  three  large  Moscow 
libraries,  but  none  of  these  items  has  yet  been  returned. 

The  Library  Asserts  Itself 

In  1952  the  government  of  the  GDR  dissolved  the  individ¬ 
ual  states  and  eliminated  the  political  mandate  for  state 
libraries.  Only  the  Saxon  State  Library  was  able  to  retain 
its  status,  to  assert  its  traditions,  and  to  secure  new  func¬ 
tions  within  the  GDR  library  system. 

The  first  tasks  facing  the  Saxon  State  Library  were 
to  eliminate  all  fascist  and  militaristic  literature  from 
its  holdings  and  to  try  to  rebuild  lost  collections.  Holdings 
of  abandoned  or  little  used  libraries  throughout  the  GDR 
were  consolidated  and  added  to  the  Dresden  collections. 
The  libraries  of  Saxon  teachers’  colleges,  gymnasia,  societies 
and  associations,  and  cashes,  nationalized  in  the  1946  land 
reform  act,  brought  a  wealth  of  material  to  the  Saxon 


State  Library.  Although  funding  was  limited,  the  Saxon 
State  Library  also  acquired  new  publications,  both  foreign 
and  domestic. 

Although  the  “Western  literature”  section  had 
special  importance,  the  library  could  make  ir  available 
only  to  special  readers,  that  is,  subject  specialists.  The 
removal  of  Western  periodicals  from  the  reading  room 
was  mandated  in  1980. 

For  the  Saxon  State  Library  to  meet  its  goal  of 
providing  broad  scholarly  literature,  it  had  to  acquire 
West  German,  American,  and  British  books  and  periodi¬ 
cals,  not  only  East  German  and  Soviet  literature.  However, 
little  hard  currency  was  available  to  purchase  Western 
publications.  The  Saxon  State  Library,  therefore,  developed 
an  active  international  exchange  program  that  allowed 
it  to  acquire  a  significant  amount  of  literature  from 
the  West.  Several  exchanges  took  place  between  the  Saxon 
State  Library  and  the  Library  of  Congress,  forming  the 
basis  for  the  present-day  cooperation  between  the 
two  institutions.  For  example,  the  Saxon  State  Library 
provided  the  Library  of  Congress  with  its  Saxon 
Bibliography  (begun  in  1961),  the  GDR  Bibliography 
of  Art  (1973-88),  and  the  Music  Bibliography  (1974-89). 
The  library’s  bibliographical  work  focused  on  its 
specialization  in  art,  music,  and  general  and  local  history. 
This  effort  resulted  in  the  library’s  designation  in 
the  1980s  as  the  Central  Library  for  Art  and  Music  in 
the  GDR. 

Library  director  Burghard  Burgemeister  (1959-90) 
was  largely  responsible  for  these  accomplishments. 

He  was  able  to  protect  the  Saxon  State  Library  against 
the  intervention  of  state  bureaucrats  and  simultaneously 
expand  the  special  collections.  He  further  transformed 
the  institution  into  one  of  the  most  important  media 
centers  in  the  German  library  system  by  merging  the 
Deutsche  Fototek  and  its  1.8  million  pictorial  documents 
into  the  library,  establishing  a  Recorded  Sound  Division 
numbering  150,000  items,  and  integrating  into  the 
holdings  the  world’s  largest  collection  of  stenographic 
manuscripts  and  books. 

When  the  Free  State  of  Saxony  was  reestablished  in 
1990  as  part  of  German  unification,  the  Saxon  State 
Library  once  again  became  the  state  library  of  Saxony.

Nineteen  ninety-six  is  the  four  hundred  fortieth

Political  Ambition  versus  Cultural 
Commitment:  The  House  of  Wettin 


German  history  is  often  viewed  from  a  Prussian  perspective 
or — at  least  for  the  period  before  the  end  of  the  German 
Confederation  in  1866 — an  Austrian  perspective.  Although 
most  of  the  smaller  German  states  eventually  lost  their 
political  autonomy  to  the  powerful  state  of  Prussia,  they 
nevertheless  played  a  major  role  in  Germany’s  thousand- 
year  history.  Among  these  Saxony  stands  out.  From 
the  Middle  Ages  on  it  was  for  centuries  an  important 
territory,  both  politically  and  economically.  It  also  is  to  this 
day  one  of  the  leading  cultural  centers  of  Germany. 


The  Origins  of  the  House  of  Wettin 

The  House  of  Wettin  dates  back  to  the  tenth  century. 

Its  members  were  first  margraves,  then  dukes,  later  electors 
and  kings.  The  Wettins,  one  of  the  oldest  German  families, 
left  their  mark  on  the  history  of  Saxony  and  also  on  that 
of  central  Germany,  at  times  playing  a  significant  role  in 
the  history  of  the  empire.  Margrave  Konrad  the  Great 
(d.  1157)  solidly  established  Wettin  rule  in  Meissen  and 
the  surrounding  area  during  a  period  when  political 
and  social  conditions  allowed  the  power  of  the  princes 
to  become  greater  than  the  central  power  of  the  king. 
Konrad  s  position  was  so  secure  that  before  his  death  he 


bequeathed  his  territory  to  his  sons  without  the  consent 
of  the  emperor,  Frederick  Barbarossa. 

Konrad’s  oldest  son  Otto  (d.  1190)  inherited  the 
Meissen  margravate  and  took  advantage  of  the  opportuni¬ 
ties  offered  by  the  great  economic,  social,  and  political 
upheavals  of  the  High  Middle  Ages.  During  the  period  of 
German  colonization  eastward,  he  had  large  forested  areas 
cleared  to  build  settlements  and  was  also  instrumental 
in  founding  the  first  cities  within  his  margravate:  Leipzig 
(founded  1160)  and  Freiberg  (1168).  These  new  cities  served 
as  centers  of  trade  and  commerce,  and  also  of  political 
support.  The  discovery  of  silver  deposits  in  the  eastern  part 
of  the  Erzgebirge  (Ore  Mountains)  laid  the  foundation 
for  Saxony’s  economic  power  and  for  the  ruler’s  designation 
as  Otto  the  Rich. 

In  1162  Otto  founded  the  Altzelle  Monastery  as  the 
private  sanctuary  of  the  Wettin  margraves,  and  it  long 
remained  the  cultural  center  of  the  margravate  of  Meissen. 
Here,  as  in  other  European  monasteries,  members  of  reli¬ 
gious  orders  produced  by  hand  unsurpassed  illuminated 
manuscripts. 

In  spite  of  the  rise  of  the  House  of  Wettin  under 
Konrad  the  Great  and  Otto  the  Rich,  the  balance  of  power 
between  the  king  and  the  imperial  princes  remained  fragile 
and  the  princes’  position  far  from  consolidated.  At  the 
end  of  the  twelfth  century  the  powerful  Hohenstaufen 
emperor  Henry  VI  confiscated  the  margravate  of  Meissen, 
threatening  the  existence  of  the  House  of  Wettin.  Only 
the  emperor’s  sudden  death  enabled  Margrave  Dietrich 
(d.  1221)  to  win  back  Meissen  for  the  Wettins.  Dietrich 
survived  the  turmoil  surrounding  the  dispute  over  the 
throne  between  the  Staufen  and  Welf  dynasties,  and 
even  strengthened  his  rule  through  the  founding  of  new 
cities,  such  as  Dresden. 

In  1247  the  power  of  the  House  of  Wettin  reached 
new  heights  under  Margrave  Heinrich  the  Exalted 
(d.  1288),  whose  inheritance  claims  and  excellent  relations 
with  the  imperial  House  of  Hohenstaufen  brought  him 
the  landgravate  of  Thiiringen.  A  few  years  earlier,  the 
Pleissenland  region  around  Altenburg  had  come  into  the 
possession  of  the  margravate  as  the  dowry  of  Margarethe, 
daughter  of  Emperor  Frederick  II  and  the  betrothed 
of  Heinrich’s  son  Albrecht.  Heinrich  also  expanded  his 


position  in  the  east  with  the  founding  of  the  city  of 
Fiirstenberg  and  the  monastery  of  Neuzelle.  He  was 
famous  among  his  contemporaries  for  the  splendor  of  his 
court.  His  residences  were  centers  of  the  chivalric 
and  courtly  culture  of  the  time.  The  margrave  himself 
even  composed  religious  songs. 

The  Rise  of  the  Wettins 

The  possessor  of  land  stretching  from  the  Werra  River 
in  the  west  to  the  Oder  River  in  the  east,  Heinrich  the 
Illustrious  was  one  of  the  most  important  princes  of 
the  empire,  yet  he  was  unable  to  expand  the  power 
of  the  House  of  Wettin.  Heinrich’s  grandson,  Friedrich 
the  Bold — son  of  Margarethe  and  grandson  of  the  last 
Hohenstaufen  emperor — even  made  a  futile  claim  to 
the  imperial  crown.  The  attempt  failed  in  part  because  of 
massive  resistance  by  the  papacy  to  any  effort  to  restore 
Hohenstaufen  rule  and  in  part  because  of  quarrels  within 
the  Wettin  family.  The  Wettins,  the  longest  reigning 
dynasty  in  German  history,  attempted  such  power  grabs 
only  rarely,  but  in  all  cases  these  efforts  failed. 

The  period  following  Heinrich’s  reign  saw  additional 
upheaval  within  the  House  of  Wettin  and  struggles  against 
the  renewed  strength  of  the  king.  At  this  time  the  situation 
appeared  more  threatening  for  the  House  of  Wettin  than 
it  had  during  the  reign  of  Emperor  Henry  VI.  At  times 
the  Meissen  margravate  came  directly  under  the  rule  of  the 
king.  Friedrich  the  Bold  (d.  1323)  reestablished  the  former 
power  of  the  House  of  Wettin.  In  a  battle  fought  near 
Lucka  in  1307,  the  Wettin  troops  decisively  defeated  the 
forces  of  King  Albrecht  of  Habsburg. 

During  the  fourteenth  century  the  margraves  asserted 
themselves  against  the  power  politics  of  Emperor  Charles 
IV.  The  early  fifteenth  century  brought  a  surprising 
and  decisive  upswing  in  the  fortunes  of  the  House  of 
Wettin.  In  1423,  after  the  last  of  the  Ascanian  dukes 
of  Saxe-Wittenberg  had  died,  Emperor  Sigismund 
bequeathed  the  duchy  of  Saxony  to  Friedrich  the  Warlike 
(d.  1428)  for  his  assistance  in  the  emperor’s  fight  against 
the  Hussites,  religious  reformers  who  were  followers 
of  John  Hus.  The  duchy  carried  with  it  electoral  status. 


Dresden:  Treasures  from  the  Saxon  State  Library 


This  gift  represented  a  major  advance  in  the  stature  of 
the  margrave,  who  thereby  became  one  of  the  seven  imper¬ 
ial  princes  who  had  the  right  to  elect  the  German  king. 

This  development  laid  the  foundation  both  for  the  politi¬ 
cally  significant  role  that  the  Albertine  line  of  the  Wettin 
dynasty  played  from  the  sixteenth  to  the  eighteenth  centu¬ 
ry  and  for  the  cultural  and  economic  development  of  the 
Saxon  states  from  the  outset  of  the  sixteenth  century.  From 
the  end  of  the  fifteenth  century,  the  name  Saxony  was 
gradually  applied  also  to  the  Meissen  margravate  and  other 
possessions  of  the  House  of  Wettin.  Friedrich,  the  first 
Wettin  Saxon  elector,  was  buried  in  the  funeral  chapel 
of  Meissen  Cathedral,  which  he  founded. 

In  1409  Friedrich  and  his  brother  Wilhelm  had  found¬ 
ed  the  University  of  Leipzig,  following  a  dispute  between 
the  German  students  and  the  University  of  Prague,  which 
had  denied  them  the  right  to  vote  for  a  president.  The 
students  took  advantage  of  the  situation  to  open  a  new 
university  in  Leipzig,  which  received  the  official  sanction 
of  the  Wettins. 

Land  Partition:  Setbacks  and  Growth 

In  1482,  during  the  joint  rule  of  the  brothers  Ernst  and 
Albrecht  the  Brave,  which  had  begun  in  1464,  the  estates 
of  the  Wettin  dynasty  were  united.  At  that  time  other 
members  of  the  family  were  archbishops  of  Mainz  and 
Magdeburg.  Never  before  had  the  House  of  Wettin 
attained  such  a  position  of  power.  But  three  years  after 
union,  Elector  Ernst  (d.  i486)  initiated  the  unfortunate 
partition  of  the  Wettin  lands.  Elector  Ernst  received, 
in  addition  to  his  electoral  area  of  Wittenberg,  the  greater 
part  of  the  Thtiringian  possessions  of  the  House  of  Wettin 
and  parts  of  the  margravate  of  Meissen.  Albrecht  received 
the  larger  part  of  the  margravate  of  Meissen  and  a  few 
parts  of  the  Thtiringian  possessions  of  the  Wettins.  This 
decision  ran  contrary  to  the  growing  tendency  to  centralize 
economic  and  political  power.  Although  the  land  partition 
was  not  intended  to  be  permanent,  nonetheless  the 
Ernestine  and  Albertine  lines  went  their  separate  ways  from 
that  time  on.  The  chance  for  future  Wettin  dominance 
in  the  eastern  part  of  Germany  had  passed.  Duke  Albrecht 


(d.  1500)  prevented  further  division  of  Albertine  Saxony 
by  passing  the  law  of  primogeniture  in  1499. 

Despite  the  unfavorable  land  partition  of  1485,  the 
Wettin  territories  in  the  sixteenth  century  were  among  the 
most  progressive  areas  of  Germany.  Their  great  economic 
resources  were  based  on  the  east-west  trade  of  the  famous 
Leipzig  fair  and  the  renewed  mining  in  the  Erzgebirge  at 
the  end  of  the  fifteenth  century.  At  the  same  time,  the  cul¬ 
tural  and  intellectual  forces  of  humanism,  the  Renaissance, 
and  the  Reformation  resulted  in  unexpected  economic, 
political,  and  cultural  energy.  Under  the  dynamic  leader¬ 
ship  of  the  Albertines — Duke  Albrecht  the  Brave  and 
his  successors  Georg,  Moritz,  and  August — this  energy 
found  practical  application. 

Duke  Albrecht  commissioned  the  construction  of 
the  Gothic  Castle  in  Meissen,  considered  the  first  uniquely 
German  castle.  Duke  Georg  (d.  1539)  concerned  himself 
with  improving  finances  and  administering  his  lands, 
despite  the  political  and  religious  troubles  of  the  time. 

In  addition,  he  began  the  construction  and  expansion  of 
Dresden,  the  capital  city  of  Albertine  Saxony.  He  was  a 
powerful  opponent  of  the  religious  views  of  Martin  Luther, 
but  his  struggle  to  have  the  Albertine  duchy  of  Saxony 
retain  allegiance  to  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  met  with 
failure.  He  was  succeeded  by  his  brother  Heinrich  the 
Pious  (d.  1541),  who  had  already  converted  to  the  Lutheran 
faith.  With  the  support  of  Elector  Johann  Friedrich  the 
Magnanimous  (d.  1547),  of  the  Ernestine  line,  Heinrich 
officially  introduced  the  Reformation  into  Albertine 
Saxony  in  July  1539. 

Duke  Moritz  (d.  1553),  son  and  successor  of  Heinrich, 
was  perhaps  the  most  politically  astute  member  of  the 
House  of  Wettin.  He  very  soon  learned  to  understand  and 
anticipate  the  diplomatic  chess  moves  of  Emperor  Charles  V, 
and  he  decisively  led  Albertine  Saxony  to  the  forefront 
of  the  Protestant  states.  At  the  same  time,  he  made  it 
the  most  powerful  territory  of  the  empire,  except  for  the 
areas  ruled  by  the  Habsburgs.  In  the  city  of  Schmalkalden 
in  1531,  several  important  German  princes  and  cities  had 
formed  an  alliance  to  defend  Protestant  interests  against 
Emperor  Charles  V.  As  a  result  of  the  Schmalkaldic  War 
of  1547,  Duke  Moritz  was  able  to  wrest  more  territory  from 
his  Ernestine  relations,  along  with  the  actual  duchy  of

Saxony  with  its  electoral  status.  Even  he,  however,  could 
not  completely  compensate  for  the  1485  territorial 
partition.  With  the  1552  Treaty  of  Passau  he  secured  the 
“liberty”  of  the  imperial  princes  and  the  continuation 
of  Protestantism. 

Art  and  Politics  in  the  Sixteenth  Century 

Elector  Moritz,  although  less  interested  in  the  arts  and 
sciences  than  his  predecessors  had  been,  made  significant 
cultural  contributions  to  enhance  his  political  position. 
These  included  additions  to  the  Dresden  Castle,  construc¬ 
tion  of  the  Moritzburg  hunting  castle  near  Dresden,  and 
the  expansion  of  Leipzig  University.  He  also  founded  three 
Fiirstenschulen  (princely  schools)  in  1543  in  Meissen, 
Grimma,  and  Pforta,  and  in  1548  he  established  the  Court 
Orchestra,  the  forerunner  of  the  Dresden  State  Orchestra. 
The  early  death  at  age  thirty-two  of  this  outstanding 
Renaissance  ruler  has  led  historians  to  speculate  whether, 
had  he  lived,  both  Saxon  and  German  history  might 
have  taken  a  different  course. 

Moritz  was  succeeded  by  his  brother  August  (d.  1586), 
who  did  not  pursue  a  bold  foreign  policy.  Intending  to 
maintain  a  balance  to  the  emperor,  he  effectively 
renounced  an  active  leadership  role  among  the  Protestant 
states  and  instead  focused  his  efforts  on  the  internal  devel¬ 
opment  of  electoral  Saxony.  Among  his  accomplishments 
were  stimulation  of  the  economy,  improved  organization 
of  the  administrative  and  judicial  systems,  better  church 
organization,  and  strong  support  for  the  arts  and  sciences. 
Saxony  enjoyed  unprecedented  prosperity  over  other 
German  territories— an  advantage  that  it  was  able  to  main¬ 
tain,  at  least  in  part,  into  the  first  half  of  the  twentieth 
century.  Among  August’s  many  cultural  contributions  was 
the  creation  of  the  Dresden  Court  Library  (today  the 
Saxon  State  Library),  based  on  his  private  library.  In  1560 
he  founded  an  art  gallery.  Having  a  strong  interest  in  archi¬ 
tecture,  as  well  as  many  other  aspects  of  the  arts,  he  invited 
Italian  artists  to  his  court.  The  Dresden  armory  and  the 
Augustusburg  and  Annaburg  castles  were  tributes  to  his 
initiative.  In  the  Freiberg  princes’  mausoleum,  he  built  an 
impressive  tomb  to  honor  his  predecessor.  Historical 


accounts  of  the  Albertine  Wettin  dynasty  document 
the  commitment  of  these  rulers  to  the  enhancement  of 
the  political,  social,  and  cultural  life  of  their  subjects. 

The  Political  Prospects  of  Saxony 

Under  Elector  Christian  I  (d.  1591)  and  his  chancellor 
Nikolaus  Krell,  electoral  Saxony  once  again  assumed 
an  active  political  role  in  the  empire  and  beyond.  Although 
Krell  sought  to  break  the  power  of  the  nobility  in  Saxony 
and  to  introduce  Calvinism,  the  early  death  of  Christian  I 
ended  these  plans.  In  foreign  politics,  Saxony  found  itself 
again  within  the  Austrian  Habsburg  sphere.  From  the 
victory  of  the  nobility  and  Lutheran  orthodoxy  arose  the 
typical  patriarchal  and  conservative  features  of  the 
administration  of  Saxony. 

During  the  devastating  Thirty  Years’  War,  the 
Albertine  line  of  the  House  of  Wettin  overestimated  its 
influence  on  the  course  of  political  events,  changing 
allegiance  from  the  emperor  to  the  Swedes  and  back  again. 
Despite  suffering  heavy  war  losses,  Saxony  was  able  to 
recover  rapidly  because  of  its  economic  resources.  The 
long-term  political  prospects  of  Saxony  had  declined  under 
Johann  Georg  I  (d.  1656),  even  though,  as  a  result  of  this 
war,  he  had  won  both  parts  of  the  Lausitz  region  in  1635. 
With  the  transfer  of  the  territory  of  the  secularized  former 
archbishopric  from  Magdeburg  to  Brandenburg,  the  politi¬ 
cal  importance  of  the  dynasty  of  the  Albertine  Wettins 
was  further  reduced.  In  his  will  of  1652  Johann  Georg  I 
further  weakened  Saxony’s  position  by  creating  three  sepa¬ 
rate  Albertine  lines  out  of  his  electoral  Saxon  dynasty 
while  upholding  the  supremacy  of  the  electoral  line.  The 
three  lines  of  the  dukes  of  Saxony-Merseburg,  Saxony- 
Weissenfels,  and  Saxony-Zeitz  died  out  in  the  first  half 
of  the  eighteenth  century,  and  their  possessions  were 
reintegrated  into  electoral  Saxony. 

The  Baroque  Period  in  Saxony 

The  baroque  period  began  in  Saxony  with  the  reign 
of  Johann  Georg  II  (d.  1680),  who  loved  splendor  and 


Dresden:  Treasures  from  the  Saxon  State  Library 


ostentation.  Art  and  culture  flourished  at  his  court.  After 
1664  the  architect  Wolf  Caspar  von  Klengel  built  the  first 
opera  house  in  Dresden,  and  in  1676  the  great  garden  near 
the  princely  residence  was  laid  out.  In  1678  Johann  Georg 
II,  with  the  rulers  of  the  three  collateral  Albertine  lines, 
held  an  “Assembly  of  Their  Highnesses”  in  Dresden. 

It  was  a  precursor  of  the  great  baroque  court  festivals  of 
the  eighteenth  century.  A  dynamic  economy  was  largely 
responsible  for  providing  the  funds  needed  for  these 
expensive  cultural  projects. 

Music  and  theater  played  a  prominent  role  in  the  life 
of  the  court.  Italian  opera  dominated  music,  and  French 
plays  captured  the  theater.  Johann  Georg  III  (d.  1691)  was 
the  first  German  prince  to  have  Moliere’s  plays  performed 
at  court.  The  performances  were  preceded  by  contests 
and  court  festivals  in  the  princely  residence  and  at  other 
locations  in  Saxony. 

In  the  late  1600s  the  foreign  policy  of  the  Albertine 
lines,  in  accordance  with  the  traditional  loyalty  to  the 
empire,  was  also  oriented  toward  the  House  of  Habsburg. 
The  Albertine  Wettins  supported  the  Habsburgs  in  the 
struggle  against  the  Turks  and  against  the  expansionist 
policy  of  Louis  XIV  of  France.  However,  Johann  Georg  II 
was  also  at  times  closely  allied  to  France,  receiving 
large  subsidies  for  his  support  from  the  French 
government. 

With  the  reign  of  Elector  Friedrich  August  I  (August 
the  Strong,  d.  1733)  began  the  so-called  “Augustan  period,” 
which  lasted  until  the  Seven  Years’  War  (1756-63).  Under 
his  rule  the  Dresden  court  was  known  as  one  of  the  most 
splendid  in  Germany  and  in  all  of  Europe.  Many  impor¬ 
tant  artists  were  drawn  to  Dresden.  Architecture,  music, 
and  the  other  arts  and  crafts  all  flourished  under  August 
the  Strong  and  his  successor  Friedrich  August  II  (d.  1763). 
Many  architectural  masterpieces  were  constructed  in 
Dresden  and  its  environs:  the  Zwinger,  Pillnitz  Castle,  the 
Frauenkirche,  and  the  Catholic  Court  Church.  Other 
architectural  gems,  including  many  palaces  of  the  nobility, 
were  built  by  such  prominent  architects  as  Matthaus 
Daniel  Poppelmann,  Georg  Bahr,  Gaetano  Chiaveri,  and 
Johann  Christoph  Knoffel.  The  palaces  and  churches  were 
decorated  by  sculptors  such  as  Balthasar  Permoser  and 
Lorenzo  Matielli. 


In  1721  Elector  Friedrich  August  I  founded  the 
art  gallery’s  Grimes  Gewolbe  (Green  Vault)  and  had  it 
embellished  with  the  works  of  the  famous  goldsmith 
Melchior  Dinglinger.  In  1754  he  and  his  successor  acquired 
the  Raphael  Sistine  Madonna  for  the  Dresden  Royal 
Gallery.  As  well  as  a  passionate  collector  of  paintings, 
Friedrich  August  II  was  also,  along  with  his  wife  Princess 
Maria  Josephine  of  Habsburg,  very  interested  in  music. 
This  era,  when  the  Court  Orchestra  was  directed  by 
conductor  Johann  Adolph  Hasse,  is  well  known  to 
musicologists. 

The  Decline  of  Saxon  Power 

The  cultural  accomplishments  of  the  Augustan  period 
would  not  have  been  possible  without  the  economic 
strength  of  the  state,  clearly  demonstrated  by  the  growing 
importance  of  the  Leipzig  trade  fairs.  Leipzig  was  the 
most  important  center  for  trade  between  central  and 
eastern  Europe,  in  particular  for  the  exchange  of  Saxon 
industrial  products  and  eastern  European  raw  materials, 
such  as  furs.  Together  with  his  strong  aesthetic  sense, 
August  the  Strong  combined  political  ambition  and  a 
remarkable  vitality  that  permitted  him  to  follow  his  ambi¬ 
tious  plans  in  two  directions  over  the  course  of  his  long 
reign.  His  domestic  policy  was  aimed  at  crushing  the 
power  of  the  nobility,  while  his  foreign  policy  envisioned 
the  establishment  of  an  east-central  European  empire  that 
could  claim  its  rightful  place  among  the  great  powers 
of  Europe.  His  ascent  to  the  Polish  throne  in  1697,  as 
King  August  II,  was  seen  as  a  first  step  in  this  direction. 
However,  because  of  his  conversion  to  Catholicism, 
Saxony  lost  its  leading  position  among  the  Protestant 
states  to  Brandenburg-Prussia.  August  the  Strong’s 
ambitions  included  gaining  additional  territories  of 
the  House  of  Habsburg  (whose  male  line  was  expected 
to  die  out  at  the  beginning  of  the  eighteenth  century) 
and  ultimately  acquiring  the  imperial  crown  for  the 
House  of  Wettin. 

For  all  his  support  of  the  arts,  as  collector,  patron,  and 
even  the  contributor  of  ideas  to  different  projects,  August 
the  Strong  never  lost  sight  of  his  political  goals.  More  than 


Political  Ambition  versus  Cultural  Commitment:  The  House  of  Wettin 


almost  any  other  German  baroque  prince,  he  was  aware 
of  his  standing  as  a  ruler.  The  extravagant  court  festivals  he 
sponsored  also  served  his  political  ambitions.  For  example, 
the  famous  court  festival  near  the  town  of  Zeithain  in  1730 
combined  baroque  pomp  and  pageantry  with  the  display 
of  military  and  political  might. 

The  reign  of  this  unusual  member  of  the  House  of 
Wettin  presents  a  contradictory  picture.  In  foreign  policy, 
he  overestimated  his  power  and  what  could  be  attained 
by  the  Albertine  branch,  especially  in  competition  with  the 
22.  aspiring  state  of  Brandenburg-Prussia.  Although  gifted  in 

many  ways,  he  lacked  the  tenacity  to  concentrate  on  long- 
range  goals.  Yet  even  though  August  the  Strong  was  largely 
unable  to  realize  his  ambitious  political  goals,  his  strong 
influence  on  the  cultural  history  of  Saxony  remains 
undisputed. 

For  his  successor,  Friedrich  August  II,  an  opera 
performance  was  always  more  important  than  the  burden¬ 
some  daily  routine  of  affairs  of  state,  as  Frederick  the  Great 
noted  scornfully  in  his  memoirs.  Friedrich  August  II  was 
dominated  by  his  powerful  minister  Count  Heinrich  von 
Briihl,  and  during  the  War  of  the  Austrian  Succession 
(1740-58)  he  lost  the  political  prestige  of  Saxony  that  had 
been  won  by  his  father. 

During  the  Seven  Years’  War  the  situation  worsened 
as  Saxony  became  a  pawn  of  the  powers  involved. 

It  quickly  recovered  from  the  economic  aftermath  of  the 
war,  however,  as  economic  and  political  reforms  were 
enacted.  With  the  gradual  establishment  of  bourgeois 
society,  the  role  of  the  monarch  was  weakened  even 
further.  Upon  the  death  of  August  II  in  1763  the  Polish- 
Saxon  personal  union  was  dissolved,  and  gradually 
Saxony  exerted  less  and  less  influence  on  the  course 
of  German  history.  Like  the  other  smaller  German  states, 
it  was  increasingly  subject  to  the  hegemony  of  Prussia 
and  Austria. 

During  the  Napoleonic  wars  the  “Holy  Roman 
Empire  of  the  German  Nation”  collapsed.  In  the  battles  of 
October  1806  near  Jena  and  Auerstadt,  the  Saxon  elector’s 
troops  initially  fought  with  the  Prussians,  who  were  defeat¬ 
ed.  Subsequently,  the  Albertine  branch,  assuming  royal 
status,  switched  allegiance  and  became  loyal  supporters 


of  Napoleon.  At  the  Congress  of  Vienna  in  1815  Saxony 
was  on  the  losing  side  and  was  forced  to  surrender  more 
than  half  its  territory  to  Prussia. 

Although  its  political  influence  continued  to  decline, 
the  Saxon  royal  house  liked  to  believe  that  its  cultural 
patronage  somewhat  balanced  these  losses.  However,  the 
first  constitution  and  the  ensuing  civil  reforms  of  1831-32 
separated  the  state  and  court  budgets,  further  limiting  the 
ruler’s  activities.  The  museums  and  other  cultural  institu¬ 
tions,  while  still  legally  in  the  possession  of  the  royal  house, 
were  now  subject  to  state  control  and  were  administered 
according  to  the  constitution. 

The  reign  of  King  Friedrich  August  II  (d.  1854) 
coincided  with  the  era  preceding  the  bourgeois-democratic 
revolution  that  culminated  in  the  1849  uprising  at  Dresden. 
The  revolution  was  crushed,  delaying  the  collapse  of 
the  old  authoritarian  monarchical  system.  Still,  over  this 
period  a  modern  bourgeois  society  gradually 
prevailed. 

In  the  era  of  the  industrial  revolution,  which  began 
in  Germany  in  Saxony  and  the  Rhineland,  the  monarchy 
and  nobility  had  less  opportunity  for  their  own  develop¬ 
ment.  King  Friedrich  August  II  established  the  collection 
of  copper  engravings  in  Dresden  and  commissioned  build¬ 
ings  by  Gottfried  Semper.  King  Johann  of  Saxony 
(d.  1873),  a  renowned  scholar,  produced  among  other 
things  a  German  translation  of  Dante’s  Divine  Comedy  that 
is  still  used  today.  This  latter  endeavor  reflects  the  private, 
almost  intimate  quality  of  Wettin  cultural  activity 
in  the  1860s. 

Saxony,  initially  aligned  with  the  Austrian  monarchy 
during  the  Austro-Prussian  War  of  1866,  became  a  member 
of  the  Prussian-led  North  German  Confederation.  At  the 
end  of  the  Franco-Prussian  War  in  1871  it  became  a  state 
within  the  German  Empire  founded  by  Bismarck.  The 
November  Revolution  of  1918,  following  World  War  I, 
brought  an  end  to  the  monarchy  in  Saxony.  King  Friedrich 
August  III  (d.  1932)  abdicated  on  13  November  1918, 
exclaiming,  “Do  your  own  dirty  work!”  (Macht  Euren 
Dreck  alleene). 

As  an  independent  state  and  one  of  the  most  econom¬ 
ically  well-developed  areas  of  Germany,  Saxony  played  an 


Dresden:  Treasures  from  the  Saxon  State  Library 


important  part  in  the  history  of  the  Weimar  Republic, 
especially  in  the  political  and  social  struggles  of  that  time. 
It  survived  the  devastation  of  World  War  II  and  became 
part  of  the  Soviet  Occupation  Zone  after  1945  and,  after 


1949,  part  of  the  German  Democratic  Republic.  However, 
the  events  of  1989  and  the  unification  of  Germany  in  1990 
made  Saxony  a  free  state  once  again.

The  Protestant  Reformation  in  Saxony 


The  Protestant  Reformation  began  in  Saxony  and 
constitutes  one  of  Saxony’s  most  significant  contributions 
to  world  history.  Arising  from  the  Reformation  were 
the  Lutheran,  Reformed,  and  Anglican  churches,  as  well 
as  other  religious  movements,  such  as  the  Puritans  and 
Quakers,  all  of  which  profoundly  influenced  the  political, 
economic,  and  cultural  life  of  Europe  and 
North  America. 

The  German  Reformation  is  primarily  associated 
with  Martin  Luther  (1483-1546).  Luther’s  opposition  to 
the  Catholic  Church’s  practice  of  selling  indulgences 
developed  into  a  powerful  mass  movement.  Fearing  divine 
punishment,  the  faithful  purchased  indulgences  to  ensure 
their  absolution  for  past  and  future  sins.  The  Catholic 
Church  used  the  proceeds  to  finance  the  sumptuous 
lifestyle  of  the  pope  and  archbishops,  as  well  as  to  subsidize 
construction  of  new  churches,  monasteries,  and  abbeys. 
Luther’s  opposition  to  indulgences  might  have  remained 
simply  a  part  of  theological  history  if  not  for  the  more 
general  social,  economic,  and  political  problems  of 
the  time,  which  had  developed  into  a  dangerous  powder 
keg  waiting  to  be  ignited. 

Luther  was  not  the  first  theologian  to  express 
reformist  ideas.  However,  he  gave  new  life  to  such  views 
and  thus  became  the  principal  force  behind  the 


Reformation,  a  religious  and  social  movement  whose 
criticism  of  spiritual  decay  in  the  Roman  Catholic  Church 
and  the  papacy  was  rooted  in  the  High  Middle  Ages. 

On  31  October  1517  Luther,  an  Augustinian  monk  and 
professor  of  biblical  studies  at  the  Saxon  University  of 
Wittenberg,  sent  to  his  church  superiors  letters  written  in 
Latin  in  which  he  enclosed  “95  Theses  on  the  Power  of 
Indulgences.”  He  intended  to  challenge  others  to  a  theo¬ 
logical  debate,  or  scholarly  disputation — a  commonplace 
activity  among  scholars  at  that  time.  Luther  also  sent  the 
theses  to  his  friends  in  Nuremberg.  The  legend  that  Luther 
personally  nailed  the  theses  to  the  door  of  Wittenberg 
Castle  Church  is  based  on  an  account  written  in  1546  by 
Philipp  Melanchthon  (1497—1560),  who  was  not  even 
present  in  Wittenberg  in  1517. 

The  immediate  motivation  behind  the  “95  Theses” 
was  the  appearance  in  Saxony  of  one  of  the  most  persistent 
sellers  of  indulgences,  the  Dominican  friar  Johann  Tetzel 
(c.  1465-1519),  who  had  a  large  following,  even  in  Saxony 
where  the  trade  in  indulgences  was  unlawful.  Pope  Julius  II 
(1503—13)  had  just  issued  an  indulgence  for  the  construc¬ 
tion  of  St.  Peter’s  Church  in  Rome.  The  papal  commission¬ 
er  of  indulgences  in  Germany  was  one  of  Luther’s  superi¬ 
ors,  Archbishop  Albrecht  of  Mainz  (1490-1545),  who  was 
deeply  in  debt  as  a  result  of  the  29,000  gulden  he  had  sent 
to  Rome  to  obtain  various  positions.  The  Fugger  banking 
house  in  Augsburg  had  advanced  him  the  money  in  the 
belief  that  his  position  as  commissioner  of  indulgences 
would  enable  him  to  settle  his  debts.  (The  commissioner 
was  allowed  to  keep  half  the  amount  acquired  from  the 
sale  of  indulgences.)  Tetzel,  who  was  always  accompanied 
by  an  official  of  the  Fuggers,  sought  to  increase  his 
proceeds  with  sayings  like  this:  “As  soon  as  the  money  falls 
into  the  box,  souls  will  jump  from  the  fires  of  Hell  into 
Heaven.”  Claims  such  as  this  were  too  much  for  Luther 
to  accept. 

Luther’s  view  of  indulgences  grew  out  of  his  so-called 
“tower  experience”:  the  basic  theological  concepts  of  God’s 
justice  he  had  acquired  while  working,  in  his  study  in  the 
Wittenberg  monastery  tower,  on  an  exegesis  of  the  biblical 
passage  Romans  1:17.  Luther  believed  that  all  efforts  to 
earn  God’s  grace  through  good  works  (indulgences,  fasting, 
pilgrimages,  entry  into  a  monastery,  the  financing  of 


masses,  and  so  forth)  are  of  no  value.  God  does  not  require 
righteousness  but  rather  grants  it  in  faith:  He  is  a  merciful 
God,  not  a  punishing  God.  Salvation  (Luther’s  question: 
“How  do  I  obtain  God’s  grace?”)  is  attainable  only  through 
faith  (sola  fide).  The  person  who  believes,  “be  he  a  sinner 
or  a  righteous  man,”  is  forgiven  through  grace  and  not 
because  he  has  somehow  “earned”  salvation.  In  this  view, 
the  buying  and  selling  of  indulgences  made  the  forgiveness 
of  sin  “a  holy  commodity”  to  be  obtained  with  money. 

Luther’s  new  theological  statement  was  developed  step 
by  step  between  1513  and  1518  as  preparation  for  his  lectures 
on  the  Psalms  and  on  Saint  Paul’s  letters  to  the  Romans, 
Galatians,  and  Hebrews.  It  was  the  real  message  of  the 
Reformation.  When  he  sent  out  his  theses,  however,  Luther 
did  not  foresee  any  reformation  of  the  Church.  He  intend¬ 
ed  only  to  oppose  the  abusive  practice  of  the  sale  of  indul¬ 
gences  by  subordinate  church  offices. 

In  1517  the  “95  Theses”  were  printed  in  Latin  in  a 
one-page  format  in  Leipzig  and  Nuremberg,  and  a  short 
time  later  they  were  printed  in  Basel  in  book  form. 

German  translations  quickly  followed.  Duke  Georg  of 
Saxony  (Georg  the  Bearded,  d.  1539)  allowed  them  to  be 
circulated  to  warn  ofTetzel’s  deception  and  to  stop  the 
illegal  trade  in  indulgences. 

A  literary  war  of  unprecedented  dimensions  followed. 
Luther’s  simple,  colloquial  writing  style  appealed  to  the 
people.  The  printing  and  book  trade  gave  Luther  access 
to  the  reading  public  and  an  unexpectedly  wide  audience 
and  influence.  In  the  next  two  years  38  manuscripts  by 
Luther  were  printed  in  113  editions  in  Leipzig  alone — 40 
percent  of  all  his  writings  printed  before  1519 — an  indica¬ 
tion  of  the  city’s  importance  in  the  publishing  trade. 

After  1520  Wittenberg  became  the  preferred  place  of  publi¬ 
cation  for  reformist  writings.  The  pope  tried  to  silence 
Luther  through  his  superiors,  but  their  attempts  failed, 
and  charges  of  heresy  were  levied  against  him.  Luther’s 
sovereign,  Elector  Friedrich  the  Wise  (d.  1525),  managed  to 
arrange  for  Luther  to  answer  the  charges  before  the  papal 
legate  Cardinal  Cajetan  (Thomas  de  Vio  from  Gaeta, 
1469-1534)  at  the  next  imperial  Diet  in  Augsburg,  rather 
than  in  Rome.  The  hearing  in  October  1518  produced  no 
result,  nor  did  a  conversation  in  January  1519  with 
the  papal  diplomat  Karl  von  Miltitz  (1490-1529)  from 


Dresden:  Treasures  from  the  Saxon  State  Library 


Dresden.  Luther  pointed  out  that  he  could  not  be  forced 
to  recant  if  he  had  not  committed  an  error. 

A  debate  in  Leipzig  from  27  June  to  16  July  1519  was 
more  productive  and  enabled  Luther  to  advance  his  theo¬ 
logical  concepts.  It  also  brought  him  new  followers,  as  well 
as  opponents,  and  divided  the  two  Saxon  states  along 
denominational  lines.  Duke  Georg  was  Luther’s  nemesis, 
but  out  of  a  desire  to  shock  his  theologians  “out  of  their 
peace  and  idleness,”  he  ordered  the  Theological  Faculty  in 
Leipzig  to  open  its  premises  to  the  debate.  The  event  took 
place  at  the  Pleissenburg,  because  the  university  auditori¬ 
um  could  not  accommodate  everyone  who  wished  to 
attend.  During  the  first  week  Andreas  Bodenstein,  called 
Karlstadt  (1486-1541),  and  Johann  Eck  (1486-1543)  argued 
on  the  topic  of  free  will.  In  the  second  week,  Luther  and 
Eck  debated  the  question  of  the  authority  of  the  pope  and 
the  Church  councils.  Pressed  by  Eck,  Luther  rejected  the 
concept  of  the  pope’s  primacy  and  his  indispensability 
for  granting  salvation;  this  was  not  God’s  but  man’s  will. 
Moreover,  he  held  that  the  pope  and  the  councils  could  err, 
and  that  the  Council  of  Constance  had  condemned  state¬ 
ments  by  Jan  Hus  that  were  Christian  and  based  on  the 
Gospels.  With  this,  Eck  had  what  he  needed:  Luther  was 
shown  to  be  a  “Saxon  Hus”  and  a  heretic.  Duke  Georg  was 
painfully  aware  that  he  himself  was  the  grandson  of  the 
“Hussite  heretic  king”  Georg  von  Podiebrad  (1420—71). 

Whether  intentionally  or  by  accident,  the  argument 
over  indulgences  developed  into  a  dispute  over  the  founda¬ 
tions  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church.  This  in  turn  won 
Luther  additional  followers,  above  all  from  the  circle 
of  humanists,  including  his  most  important  ally,  Philipp 
Melanchthon.  Other  south  German  supporters  of  Luther 
included  Ulrich  von  Hutten  (1488-1523)  and  Willibald 
Pirckheimer  (1470-1530),  as  well  as  Pirckheimer’s  friend, 
the  painter  Albrecht  Diirer  (1471-1528).  They  supported 
Luther  in  letters  and  pamphlets.  The  Saxon  State  Library 
in  Dresden  has  a  collection  of  these  Reformation 
pamphlets. 

Luther  was  an  extremely  prolific  writer.  In  his  words, 

“a  rapid  hand  and  perfect  memory”  were  his  assets.  In  1520, 
in  addition  to  other  texts,  he  published  the  three  principal 
Reformation  theses:  The  Address  to  the  Christian  Nobility  of 
the  German  Nation,  The  Babylonian  Captivity  of  the  Church, 


and  The  Freedom  of  the  Christian  Man.  These  works  were 
the  foundation  of  the  Reformation  and  carried  the  message 
of  the  movement  into  the  country.  The  first  4,000  copies 
of  the  Address  to  the  Christian  Nobility  sold  out 
in  a  few  days. 

While  Luther  was  writing  his  major  theses,  further 
measures  were  planned  against  him  in  Rome.  With  Eck’s 
cooperation,  a  papal  bull,  warning  of  excommunication, 
was  issued  in  June  1520,  but  Eck  encountered  difficulties  in 
distributing  the  document  in  Germany.  Nor  was  Friedrich 
the  Wise  prepared  to  permit  distribution  of  the  publica¬ 
tion.  By  December  1520  Luther  burned  the  papal  bull 
before  the  Elster  Gate  in  Wittenberg.  Rome  responded  to 
this  challenge  by  excommunicating  Luther  in  January  1521. 

According  to  law,  excommunication  from  the  Catholic 
Church  was  to  be  followed  by  a  similar  imperial  ban. 
Elector  Friedrich  won  agreement  from  the  newly  elected 
emperor  Charles  V  that  Luther  should  not  be  condemned 
without  a  hearing.  In  April  1521  Luther  had  to  appear  in 
Worms  before  the  Diet,  consisting  of  the  emperor,  the 
electors,  and  representatives  of  other  states.  In  the  Edict 
of  Worms  (May  1521)  the  Diet  declared  an  imperial  ban 
on  Luther  and  his  followers,  ordered  their  writings  to  be 
burned,  and  placed  all  books  appearing  in  Germany  under 
church  censorship.  To  protect  him,  Friedrich  the  Wise 
hid  Luther  in  Wartburg  Castle  near  Eisenach. 

It  is  still  unclear  why  Friedrich  the  Wise,  who  did 
not  endorse  the  Reformation  and  who  saw  Luther  only  at 
the  Diet  of  Worms,  protected  him,  thus  encouraging  the 
spread  of  the  Reformation.  It  may  be  that  Friedrich  was 
motivated  by  a  strong  sense  of  justice.  Perhaps  the  prestige 
of  Wittenberg  University,  which  he  had  founded  in  1502, 
also  played  a  role.  When  Luther  taught  there,  enrollment 
increased  (students  even  came  from  neighboring  coun¬ 
tries),  while  enrollment  at  its  rival  university  in  Leipzig 
declined.  The  pope  tolerated  Friedrich’s  attitude  in  view 
of  the  upcoming  election  of  a  new  emperor. 

While  in  hiding,  Luther  translated  the  New  Testament 
into  German,  based  on  the  Greek  edition  that  Erasmus 
of  Rotterdam  (1466/69-1536)  had  published  and  translated 
into  Latin.  Luther  completed  the  work  in  eleven  weeks, 
and  it  appeared  with  a  preface  in  September  1522 
(the  September  Testament)  in  Wittenberg  without  naming 


The  Protestant  Reformation  in  Saxony 


either  the  translator  or  the  printer.  It  was  so  successful  that 
another  edition  was  issued  in  December  (the  December 
Testament) .  Translation  of  the  Old  Testament  followed  in 
installments.  By  the  time  the  first  complete  German-lan¬ 
guage  Bible  was  published  in  1534,  the  New  Testament  had 
reached  a  record  printing:  eighty-seven  High  German 
editions,  nineteen  Low  German  editions,  three  translations 
in  Dutch,  one  in  Danish,  and  one  in  Swedish.  Luther’s 
translation  of  the  Bible  set  unprecedented  standards  for 
accuracy,  greatly  influencing  the  development  of  the  new 
High  German  language.  It  also  set  standards  for  translating 
the  Bible  into  different  national  languages,  especially  in 
states  that  endorsed  the  Reformation. 

After  Luther’s  Wartburg  period,  the  Reformation 
developed  its  own  momentum.  In  Wittenberg,  which 
became  the  center  of  the  movement,  and  in  other  cities, 
his  followers  began  to  apply  his  teachings  to  church  life. 
Following  the  impressive  Leipzig  debate,  individual  Saxon 
priests  had  begun  to  preach  evangelisch  (according  to 
the  Gospels)  in  Leipzig,  Dobeln,  Grimma,  the  Lausitz  area, 
Zittau,  Gorlitz,  and  Bautzen.  Everywhere  monks  and  nuns 
began  to  leave  the  monasteries,  and  priests  took  marriage 
vows  long  before  Luther  himself  laid  aside  his  monk’s  robe 
(16  October  1524)  and  married  (13  June  1525).  In  January 
1522  the  German  Augustinian  congregation  was  dissolved 
in  Wittenberg.  In  1524  Duke  Georg  had  to  close  the 
Celestine  monastery  on  the  Konigstein  when  only  the 
proctor  remained.  The  situation  was  similar  for  the  monas¬ 
teries  of  other  church  orders.  Many  monks  became  pastors 
and  devoted  themselves  to  proclaiming  the  Reformation. 

In  many  cities  councilmen  urged  the  appointment 
of  a  Reform  pastor,  while  others  asked  Luther  to  name 
a  suitable  candidate. 

In  Wittenberg  Karlstadt,  Justus  Jonas  (1493-1555),  and 
Gabriel  Zwilling  (d.  1558)  actively  opposed  indulgences 
and  masses  for  the  dead,  and  Karlstadt  preached  in  secular 
dress  on  Christmas  Day  1521  and  administered  the  Lord’s 
supper  with  bread  and  wine.  These  were  revolutionary 
actions.  In  December,  in  the  midst  of  this  iconoclasm,  the 
“Zwickau  Prophets”  arrived,  with  whom  Thomas  Miintzer 
(i489?-i525)  was  closely  associated.  Given  their  name  by 
Luther,  the  “Zwickau  Prophets”  included  the  clothmakers 
Nikolaus  Stovel  and  Thomas  Drechsel,  and  former 


Wittenberg  student  Markus  Thomas.  Strongly  pro- 
Reformation,  they  were  also  dreamers. 

Luther  was  summoned  and  returned  to  Wittenberg 
on  6  March  1522.  With  his  famous  sermon  on  Invocavit 
Sunday,  he  tried  to  stop  the  iconoclastic  excesses.  He 
preached  cautious  reforms  following  sufficient  spiritual 
preparation  and  protection  of  the  weak.  Everything 
associated  with  the  idea  of  sacrifice  was  stricken  from  the 
mass,  the  confession,  and  also  the  private  masses.  In  1523 
Luther’s  Baptismal  Booklet,  which  made  it  possible  for 
the  sacrament  of  baptism  to  be  conducted  in  the  German 
language,  appeared.  This  was  followed  in  1526  by  his 
German  Mass  and  Order  of  Worship,  and  in  1529  by  the 
Booklet  on  the  Marriage  Ceremony. 

With  the  elimination  of  priests  to  perform  the  mass, 
the  new  order  set  free  all  those  funds  that  had  been  donat¬ 
ed  to  subsidize  worship  services.  The  “Leisnig  Collection 
Box  Ruling”  of  1523  (Leisnig  is  located  between  Leipzig  and 
Dresden)  was  an  example  for  other  evangelical  church 
organizations.  This  income  for  the  parish  and  the  church 
would  go  into  a  common  collection  box,  which  supported 
the  pastor,  sexton,  schoolmaster,  the  poor,  and  orphans. 
Luther’s  Ruling  on  the  Common  Collection  Box  pointed 
out  that  the  collection  boxes  should  not  be  used  to  support 
beggar  monks  or  pilgrims,  as  was  sanctioned  by  church 
rules.  His  rules  laid  the  foundation  for  the  evangelical 
charitable  organizations  of  today. 

The  Reformation  was  not  a  united  movement. 
Through  Huldrych  Zwingli  (1484-1531)  and  John  Calvin 
(1509-64),  it  soon  developed  other  centers  and  diversified. 
At  the  beginning  of  the  Reformation,  the  “Zwickau 
Prophets”  acquired  a  certain  significance  for  Saxony,  as 
did  the  German  Peasants’  War  (1524—25).  Although  Luther’s 
opponents  liked  to  portray  the  situation  differently,  the 
peasant  revolts  were  part  of  the  social  struggles  of  the  late 
Middle  Ages,  which  the  Reformation  accelerated  but  did 
not  cause. 

In  regard  to  Karlstadt,  it  is  unclear  whether  he  was 
already  a  fanatic  and  iconoclast  in  his  Wittenberg  period 
or  whether  he  became  more  consistent  once  reforms  were 
introduced.  Valentin  Weigel  (1533-88)  belonged  to  the  next 
generation  of  reformers.  While  conscientiously  carrying 
out  his  pastoral  duties  in  the  small  Saxon  town  of 


Dresden:  Treasures  from  the  Saxon  State  Library 


Zschopau,  he  wrote  works  that  he  concealed  in  his  desk 
or  entrusted  to  a  few  friends.  His  writings,  along  with  the 
ideas  of  the  German  mystic  and  natural  philosopher 
Paracelsus  (Theophrastus  Bombastus  von  Hohenheim, 
1493/94-1541),  stand  in  a  direct  line  from  the  radical  wing 
of  the  Reformation  to  Jakob  Bohme  (1575-1624).  Weigel’s 
manuscripts,  published  after  his  death,  created  a  great 
sensation  in  the  seventeenth  century. 

After  1524  Germany  began  to  divide  into  two  denomi¬ 
national  camps,  and  within  Saxony  there  was  a  strict  sepa¬ 
ration  for  the  next  fifteen  years.  Duke  Georg  continued  to 
persecute  every  reformist  movement  or  action  in  Albertine 
Saxony  and  ordered  the  expulsion  of  those  of  evangelical 
persuasion  in  a  mandate  of  1532,  implemented  especially  in 
Leipzig.  He  encouraged  his  court  chaplains,  Hieronymus 
Emser  (1477-1527)  and  Johannes  Cochlaeus  (1479-1552), 
to  write  against  Luther  and  often  did  so  himself  to  “root 
out  the  cursed  Lutheran  sects.”  Luther  responded  to  all 
his  opponents. 

At  the  end  of  his  life  Duke  Georg  became  a  tragic 
figure.  He  had  to  accept  the  fact  that  the  Reformation  had 
made  inroads  within  his  state:  after  1532  in  the  Freiberg 
domain  of  his  brother  Heinrich  the  Pious  (1473-1541)  and 
after  1537  in  the  Rochlitz  area  ruled  by  his  widowed  daugh¬ 
ter-in-law  Elisabeth  (1502-57).  Georg’s  efforts  to  defend  his 
state  against  the  Reformation  after  his  death  failed.  His 
two  sons  died  before  their  father.  Later,  Georg  tried  in  his 
will  to  force  his  brother  Heinrich,  who  was  next  in  line, 
to  the  Catholic  side,  but  negotiations  with  the  Saxon 
estates  over  the  will  dragged  on,  and  the  issue  was  never 
resolved.  In  the  spring  of  1539  Heinrich  the  Pious  assumed 
power  and,  at  the  funeral  of  his  brother,  made  clear  which 
denominational  faith  he  intended  to  introduce  into 
Albertine  Saxony.  On  6  July  1539  the  first  evangelical 
worship  service  was  held  in  the  Dresden  Kreuzkirche. 

In  electoral  (Ernestine)  Saxony,  after  the  turbulent 
early  years,  construction  was  begun  on  an  evangelical  state 
church  under  Friedrich  the  Wise’s  successors,  his  brother 
Johann  the  Constant  (d.  1532)  and  Johann’s  son  Johann 
Friedrich  the  Magnanimous  (d.  1554).  The  duchy  of 
Prussia,  the  first  evangelical  state — founded  in  1525  by 
Albrecht  of  Brandenburg  (1490-1568),  grand  master  of 
the  Teutonic  Order — served  as  a  model.  The  ruler  was 


requested  by  Luther  to  maintain  order  in  the  church.  In 
turn,  from  1526  to  1530  electoral  Saxony’s  church  and 
school  inspection,  based  on  Melanchthon’s  1528  Instruction 
for  Inspectors,  served  as  an  example  for  other  evangelical  ter¬ 
ritories.  The  inspectors  were  to  evaluate  the  life  and  teach¬ 
ings  of  the  pastor  and  see  that  the  nobility  and  the  cities 
did  not  enrich  themselves  on  church  property.  The  inspec¬ 
tions  showed  a  shocking  ignorance  of  religious  matters 
among  the  pastors  and  members  of  the  congregations.  In 
1529  Luther  felt  compelled  to  draw  up  the  Large  Catechism 
for  pastors  and  the  Small  Catechism  for  the  father  of  each 
household,  both  to  be  learned  by  heart.  In  the  capital  city 
of  each  district,  pastors  were  installed  as  superintendents 
to  oversee  religious  matters.  Consistories  were  formed  (the 
first  in  Wittenberg  in  1539)  to  handle  matters  of  ecclesiasti¬ 
cal  jurisdiction,  such  as  matrimonial  cases  or  complaints 
made  against  pastors.  After  1539  the  reorganization  of  the 
church  hierarchy  in  Albertine  Saxony  proceeded  simultane¬ 
ously.  For  the  use  of  the  inspectors,  Justus  Jonas  devised 
the  “Heinrich  Liturgy”  (used  in  Duke  Heinrich’s  territory), 
which  became  the  official  order  of  service. 

Meanwhile,  matters  had  come  to  a  head  in  regard  to 
the  political  situation  of  the  empire.  At  the  Diets  of  Speyer 
in  1526  and  1529,  the  Catholic  princes  renewed  their  deci¬ 
sion  to  implement  the  Edict  of  Worms.  The  evangelical 
minority  responded  in  1529  with  a  formal  protest,  from 
which  the  name  Protestants  derives.  The  Diet  of  Augsburg 
in  1530  was  a  milestone  in  the  development  of  the  evangeli¬ 
cal  creed.  At  the  request  of  the  elector,  Melanchthon 
worked  out  a  position  paper,  The  Augsburg  Confession 
(Confessio  Augustana),  the  first  compilation  of  evangelical 
precepts.  Thereupon,  Eck,  on  orders  of  the  emperor, 
produced  a  rebuttal  ( Confutatio),  and  the  emperor  regarded 
the  case  as  settled.  Because  he  had  been  pronounced  an 
outlaw,  Luther  could  not  take  part  in  the  Augsburg 
proceedings.  He  watched  events  from  the  Coburg  Castle 
and  ridiculed  the  “parliament  of  crows  and  jackdaws,” 
as  he  called  it.  Melanchthon’s  Augsburg  Confession  seemed 
too  moderate  for  him,  and  he  remarked,  “I  cannot  tread 
so  quietly  and  gently.”  In  1537  Luther  strengthened  the 
contents  of  the  Augsburg  Confession  by  issuing  the 
Schmalkald  Articles,  which  became  a  statement  of  faith 
of  the  Lutheran  Church. 


The  Protestant  Reformation  in  Saxony 


The  Diet  concluded  without  an  agreement  but  with 
the  emperor’s  threat  to  wage  war  against  the  evangelical 
princes  if  they  did  not  submit.  To  protect  themselves 
against  this  danger,  they  formed  the  Schmalkaldic  League 
as  a  war  alliance  in  February  1531.  This  league  and  the  addi¬ 
tional  threat  of  danger  from  the  Turks  forced  the  emperor 
to  agree  to  a  truce.  In  the  Nuremberg  Truce  of  1532  the 
Protestants  were  tacitly  tolerated  until  a  future  council 
could  be  called.  The  council  met  again  in  1545  in  Trent, 
a  town  in  the  far  south  of  the  empire.  It  was  a  gathering 
of  Catholics  only,  since  the  German  Protestants  refused  to 
attend.  Luther  did  not  live  to  see  the  ensuing  setbacks  for 
the  Reformation.  He  died  on  18  February  1546  in  Eisleben. 

Because  a  solution  could  not  be  found  through  the 
Council  of  Trent,  the  emperor  chose  to  enforce  his  power 
by  waging  war  against  the  Protestant  rebel  princes  (the 
Schmalkaldic  War,  1546-47).  During  the  war  Duke  Moritz 
of  Saxony  (d.  1553)  came  under  a  cloud.  Although  he  firmly 
supported  the  development  of  the  Reformation  in 
Albertine  Saxony,  he  was  lured  by  the  diplomacy  of  the 
Habsburgs  and  the  promise  of  gaining  electoral  status  and 
Ernestine  Saxon  territory.  This  promise,  and  the  chance  to 
reverse  the  1485  partition  of  Saxony,  prompted  him  to  fight 
on  the  side  of  the  emperor.  Following  the  defeat  of  the 
Schmalkaldic  League  at  the  battle  of  Miihlberg  in  April 
1547,  the  imperial  Diet  in  1548  issued  the  Augsburg 
Interim,  which  permitted  the  Protestants  only  two  conces¬ 
sions:  lay  participation  in  the  offering  of  communion  and 
the  marriage  of  priests.  Otherwise,  it  required  a  return  to 
the  old  doctrines  and  rites.  Duke  Moritz,  because  he  had 
supported  the  Catholic  emperor  and  won  electoral  status 
as  a  result,  was  scorned  by  the  people  as  the  “Judas  of 
Meissen.”  He  came  under  further  pressure  and  had  to 
implement  the  Augsburg  Interim  as  imperial  law  even  in 
his  own  territory.  Playing  for  time,  he  asked  his  consulting 
theologians,  particularly  Melanchthon,  to  work  out  a  less 
strict  version,  the  Leipzig  Articles.  The  articles  conceded 
to  the  Catholic  rites  adiaphora  (unimportant  matters), 
such  as  the  structure  of  the  worship  service,  but  held  firm 
to  the  basic  articles  of  evangelical  doctrine,  such  as 
justification  by  faith. 

The  Leipzig  Articles  were  never  implemented.  Instead, 
there  began  one  of  many  internal  disputes  among  the 


Protestants,  which  continued  for  several  decades  and 
reached  a  critical  point  in  Saxony  with  crypto-Calvinism 
and  the  fall  of  the  chancellor  Nikolaus  Krell  (155CP-1601). 
This  time,  the  Gnesio  Lutherans,  the  “true  Lutherans” — 
that  is,  Lutheran  theologians  such  as  Nikolaus  von 
Amsdorf  (1483-1565),  Matthias  Flacius  Illyricus  (1520-75), 
and  their  followers — criticized  the  “Philippists”  (Philipp 
Melanchthon  and  his  followers)  for  being  too  ready  to 
compromise  and  rejected  the  Leipzig  Articles  as  a  “Leipzig 
Interim.”  The  attacks  they  made  in  their  campaign  were 
clearly  directed  against  Duke  Moritz. 

For  personal  reasons,  but  largely  because  of  the  repres¬ 
sive  power  and  religious  policy  of  the  emperor,  Duke 
Moritz  changed  sides,  joined  the  north  German  evangelical 
princes  (who  were  opposed  to  the  emperor  for  the  same 
reasons),  and  became  their  leader  and  the  savior  of 
Protestantism.  Strengthened  by  a  treaty  with  the  French 
King  Henry  II  (1519-59),  Moritz  took  the  field  with  the 
evangelical  princes  in  a  surprise  attack  against  the  emperor, 
who,  however,  escaped.  On  2  August  1552  the  evangelical 
princes  formulated  the  Treaty  of  Passau,  which  led  to 
the  Religious  Peace  of  Augsburg  on  25  September  1555. 

The  Peace  of  Augsburg  recognized  “those  associated  with 
the  Augsburg  Confession”  and  allowed  them  their 
religious  independence. 

The  Reformation  came  to  an  end  in  Saxony  with  the 
General  Articles  issued  in  1557  by  Elector  August  I  (d.  1586, 
brother  and  successor  of  Moritz).  Along  with  Heinrich’s 
Liturgy,  the  General  Articles  represent  the  first  binding 
church  legislation. 

The  Reformation,  yielding  to  political  pressure,  relied 
on  the  holders  of  territorial  power  who  had  made  it  possi¬ 
ble  and  assured  its  survival.  As  a  result,  there  were  as  many 
legally  independent  state  churches  as  there  were  political 
territories.  The  Religious  Peace  of  Augsburg  permitted  only 
the  sovereign  rulers  to  select  the  religious  denomination 
of  their  territory,  under  the  principle  cuius  regio,  eius  religio. 
This  religious  decision  by  the  prince  was,  therefore,  of  vital 
importance  to  his  subjects.  The  state  rulers  and  also  the 
emperor,  despite  their  apparent  piety,  used  religion  as  a 
means  to  achieve  their  political  goals.  Famous  examples  of 
this  were  Henry  IV’s  (1553-1610)  conversion  to  Catholicism 
at  the  end  of  the  century  to  become  King  of  France 


Dresden:  Treasures  from  the  Saxon  State  Library 


(“Paris  is  worth  a  mass”),  and  the  conversion  of  the  Saxon 
elector  August  the  Strong  (Friedrich  August  I,  d.  1733) 
to  acquire  the  Polish  crown.  By  then,  subjects  no  longer 
had  to  change  their  religious  affiliation  to  that  of 
the  ruler.  Thus,  Saxony  has  remained  largely  Lutheran 
to  this  day. 

The  Protestant  states  received  permanent  benefits 
in  the  improvement  of  their  educational  systems.  Through 
their  writings,  Luther  and  Melanchthon  appealed  to 
the  authorities  to  establish  schools,  including  schools  for 
girls.  Melanchthon’s  reorganization  of  the  University  of 
Wittenberg  was  an  example  for  all  other  Protestant  univer¬ 
sities,  as  were  his  widely  circulated  instruction  books. 

The  Latin  schools  were  reformed  and  were  closely  connect¬ 
ed  with  evangelical  and  humanist  education.  Melanchthon 
became  the  Praeceptor  Germaniae.  In  1543  Saxony 
established  the  basis  for  its  own  educational  tradition 
with  Elector  Moritz’s  order  to  form  the  princely  schools 
(Furstenschulen)  of  St.  Afra  in  Meissen,  St.  Marien  in 
Pforta  (Schulpforta  near  Naumburg),  and  St.  Augustin  in 
Grimma.  These  university-preparatory  schools  were 


attended  by  children  of  the  princes  and  the  nobility,  as  well 
as  young  people  from  various  cities.  They  also  provided 
scholarships  for  poor  students. 

The  favorite  art  form  of  Protestantism  was  music. 
Luther  himself  favored  a  “singing  church”  and  considered 
choral  singing  as  important  to  the  church  experience  as 
the  sermon  and  communion.  In  his  words,  “To  a  good 
sermon  belongs  a  good  song.”  Where  there  was  a  shortage 
of  German  songs,  Luther  would  compose  his  own,  and 
today  the  evangelical  church  can  thank  him  for  some 
of  its  most  beautiful  hymns. 

The  Reformation  divided  Christendom  into  different 
denominations,  with  the  Catholic  Church  no  longer  repre¬ 
senting  all  Christians.  The  privileges  and  responsibilities 
of  the  individual  in  Reformation  theology  extended  to,  and 
caused  changes  in,  the  secular  world  of  commerce,  educa¬ 
tion,  law,  and  personal  conduct.  Society  was  not  complete¬ 
ly  secularized;  belief  in  an  active  and  omnipresent  God 
remained  central  to  late  medieval  and  early  Renaissance 
life.  However,  now  the  nature  of  that  God  and  humanity’s 
relation  to  him  was  open  to  multiple  interpretations.

The  Literature  of  Romanticism 
in  Dresden 


In  European  intellectual  history,  Romanticism  was 
a  direct  reaction  to  the  prescribed  rules  of  reason  of  the 
Enlightenment.  It  was  also  a  call  for  intellectual  renewal 
that  had  evolved  from  the  changes  brought  by  the  French 
Revolution  that  began  in  1789.  Romanticism  was  a 
group  phenomenon,  involving  friendships  among  writers 
and  literary  circles.  Intellectuals  combined  the  demand 
for  freedom  with  the  elimination  of  the  current  literary 
standard  and  strengthened  the  imagination  through 
sensitive  expression.  Romantic  authors  and  artists  wanted 
to  revitalize  what  they  thought  of  as  the  universal  value 
concepts  of  the  Middle  Ages  in  Germany.  Romanticism 
developed  into  a  literary  movement  centered  in  the  cities 
of  Berlin,  Heidelberg,  and  Jena  and  was  also  referred 
to  in  regional  terms,  as  Rhine,  Munich,  or  Swabian 
Romanticism. 


Dresden  as  a  Source  of  Artistic  Inspiration 

For  a  brief  period  Dresden  was  one  of  the  centers 
of  Romanticism.  Because  of  the  beauty  of  its  countryside, 
Dresden  has  always  been  a  place  of  inspiration  for  artists 
and  musicians.  The  “Romantic  School”  was  born 
in  Dresden  during  the  summer  of  1798,  when  a  group 


of  Romantics  brought  recognition  and  attention  to  the 
Sistine  Madonna,  which  the  Dresden  Royal  Gallery  had 
owned  since  1754.  This  was  an  altar  painting  from  the 
church  of  the  San  Sisto  Benedictine  Monastery  in 
Piacenza,  Italy,  which  had  been  donated  to  the  monastery 
by  Pope  Julius  II.  It  was  acquired  for  the  Saxon  capital 
city  by  Elector  Friedrich  August  II  for  20,000  gold  ducats 
(approximately  us $200,000  today).  This  painting  by 
Raphael  Santi  (1483-1520)  became  a  world-famous  work 
of  art.  The  American  poet  Henry  Miles  (1824—71)  wrote 
in  his  poem  “San  Sisto”  that  the  Madonna  had  made 
Dresden  a  “Holy  City.” 

The  young  men  and  women  who  came  to  Dresden 
during  the  summer  of  1798  to  widen  their  horizons 
were  unusually  gifted  and  sensitive  individuals.  They 
were  the  group  of  Romantics  from  Jena,  who  had 
first  gathered  at  the  Pillnitz  home  of  the  Saxon  privy 
councilor  Ludwig  Emanuel  Ernst  and  his  wife  Charlotte. 
This  group  included  five  prominent  authors:  Friedrich 
Schlegel,  August  Wilhelm  and  Caroline  Schlegel, 

Friedrich  von  Hardenberg,  and  Friedrich  Wilhelm 
Joseph  Schelling. 

Friedrich  Schlegel  (1772-1829)  was  already  familiar 
with  this  center  of  artistic  riches  through  his  stay  in 
Dresden  from  January  1794  to  the  summer  of  1796.  He 
had  devoted  this  period  to  an  exhaustive  study  of  the 
history  of  classical  literature,  the  theory  of  literature,  and 
the  philosophy  of  history.  Schlegel  always  emphasized 
the  profound  influence  these  two  and  a  half  years  in 
Dresden  had  had  on  his  literary  life. 

His  brother,  August  Wilhelm  Schlegel  (1767-1845), 
professor  of  literature  and  philology  and  inspired  translator 
of  Shakespeare’s  plays,  had  also  decided  to  move  to 
Dresden  in  August  1796,  although  he  feared  that  he  would 
be  subject  to  the  city’s  conservatism.  He  was  accompanied 
by  his  wife,  Caroline  (1763-1809),  one  of  the  most  interest¬ 
ing  women  of  the  Romantic  period  and  an  accomplished 
letter  writer. 

Von  Hardenberg  (1772-1801)  of  nearby  Freiberg  is 
perhaps  best  known  as  Novalis  (cultivator  of  new  land), 
as  he  called  himself.  This  profound  lyric  poet  of  great 
melodic  sadness  was  also  a  systematic  and  mystical  thinker. 
Schelling  (1775-1854)  became  a  professor  in  Jena  at  age 


twenty-three  and  had  already  published  basic  works  in 
natural  philosophy. 

These  five  authors  met  in  Dresden,  the  “Florence 
of  the  North,”  on  25-26  August  1798,  to  view  and  discuss 
works  in  the  classical  collection  of  the  Japanese  Palace 
(once  the  location  of  what  is  now  the  Saxon  State  Library), 
where  torchlights  illuminated  the  stone  contours  of  the 
building.  In  the  art  gallery  of  the  Johanneum,  a  three-story 
Renaissance  building  constructed  in  1586  at  the  Neuen 
Markt,  they  studied  the  gestures  and  expressions  portrayed 
in  the  fabled  paintings  of  Claude  Lorrain,  Jacob  van 
Ruisdael,  Hans  Holbein,  Salvator  Rosa,  Correggio 
(Antonio  Allegri),  and  Giorgione.  Kneeling  before  the 
Sistine  Madonna,  the  five  authors  poetically  consecrated 
it  as  “the  acme  of  human  creativity.” 

In  their  discussions,  they  emphasized  authentic 
experience  and  the  early  Romantic  world  of  contempla¬ 
tion.  The  discussions  culminated  in  the  poetic-philosophic 
dialogue  Die  Gemahlde  (The  Paintings),  written  by  August 
Wilhelm  and  Caroline  Schlegel  and  published  the  follow¬ 
ing  year  in  the  journal  Athenaeum.  Die  Gemahlde  was 
the  basic  document  and  Athenaeum  the  most  important 
publication  for  formulating  the  theory  of  early  romanti¬ 
cism.  The  theory  grew  out  of  that  overwhelming 
experience  in  the  Dresden  gallery. 

Influence  on  American  and  British  Literary  History 

The  influence  of  the  Schlegel  brothers  on  American  literary 
history  has  been  documented  by  Ernst  Behler,  the 
German-American  specialist  in  German  Romanticism  at 
the  University  of  Washington.  As  one  of  the  leading  schol¬ 
ars  of  their  manuscripts,  he  published  The  Writings  of  the 
Schlegel  Brothers  in  1983.  August  Wilhelm’s  literary  history 
was  translated  into  English  in  1815.  The  first  American 
edition  appeared  in  1833.  It  is  known  to  have  influenced 
the  literature  of  the  American  writer  Edgar  Allan  Poe 
(1809-49).  As  early  as  1812  the  Philadelphia  journal  Port 
Folio  referred  to  Schlegel’s  Vienna  lectures  “On  Dramatic 
Art  and  Literature”  (which  had  been  published 
in  Heidelberg  in  1809-11).  An  English  translation  of 
Friedrich’s  History  of  Old  and  New  Literature  (Vienna,  1815), 


Dresden:  Treasures  from  the  Saxon  State  Library 


which  advanced  new  theories  in  German  literary  criticism, 
appeared  in  Philadelphia  in  1818.  By  1833  scholarly  discus¬ 
sions  of  the  Schlegel  brothers  appeared  frequently  in  liter¬ 
ary  journals,  particularly  in  the  American  Monthly  Review. 
They  were  respected,  cited,  and  credited  with  stimulating 
interest  in  aesthetic  concepts  in  American  literary  criticism. 

Strong  ties  also  existed  between  the  German  and 
English  Romanticists.  Thomas  Carlyle  (1795-1881),  the 
great  English  historian  and  writer,  valued  German  culture 
and  translated  the  works  of  many  German  writers  for 
English-speaking  audiences.  In  1829  he  wrote  a  thoughtful 
and  stimulating  essay  on  Novalis,  which  made  a  lasting 
impression  on  Anglo-American  audiences.  Before  the  com¬ 
plete  translation  was  published  in  1842,  The  New  Yorker 
published  in  1839,  on  *ts  title  Page’  a  translation  of  the 
“Weinlied”  from  Novalis’s  novel  Heinrich  von  Ofterdingen. 
The  Americans  Henry  Wadsworth  Longfellow  (1807-82) 
and  Poe  showed  a  strong  interest  in  Novalis’s  writing, 
establishing  an  awareness  of  him  among  a  small  literary 
public.  Finally,  the  “Blaue  Blume”  became  a  popular 
symbol  of  the  Romantic  concept  of  happiness  in  Henry 
van  Dyke’s  (1852-1933)  Blue  Flower  { 1902),  a  paraphrased 
version  of  the  first  dream  in  Heinrich  von  Ofterdingen. 

Romantics  in  the  Library 

During  the  eighteenth  century,  the  Court  Library  in 
Dresden  developed  into  a  renowned  European  cultural 
institution.  The  Romantic  writers  eagerly  consulted  its 
valuable  resources  during  their  visits  to  Dresden.  The 
lending  records  from  1797  to  1803  show  that  the  Schlegel 
brothers  visited  the  library  on  3  July  1798  and  that 
Friedrich  borrowed  the  Gottingische  Museum,  while  his 
brother  delved  into  Anderson’s  Collections  of  English  Poets 
(London,  1795).  Several  days  later  Friedrich,  who  was 
studying  the  works  of  Petrarch,  borrowed  the  Obras  Livicas 
by  another  humanist,  the  Spaniard  Diego  Hurtado  de 
Mendoza  (1503-75). 

On  10  August  1799  Novalis  visited  the  library  for  the 
first  time.  He  made  frequent  visits  thereafter  in  1800  and 
1801,  at  least  nine  in  all,  revealing  his  interest  in  the  Greek 
tragedians  Aeschylus  and  Sophocles;  the  theosophical 


writings  of  the  Silesian  mystic  Jakob  Bohme  (1575-1624), 
whose  search  for  God  moved  him  deeply;  and  the  poems 
of  the  prolific  Meistersinger  Hans  Sachs  (1494-1576).  On  20 
January  1801,  deathly  ill,  the  twenty-nine-year-old  Novalis 
left  Dresden,  but  four  days  later  he  returned  Tiberius 
Cavallo’s  Treatment  of  the  Theoretical  and  Practical 
Knowledge  of  Electricity  (Leipzig,  1783)  to  the  library,  an 
indication  of  his  interest  in  the  natural  sciences. 

Another  regular  user  of  the  library  was  Ludwig  Tieck 
(1773-1853),  a  Romantic  writer  with  a  highly  developed 
sense  of  fantasy,  who  moved  easily  and  skillfully  in  all 
literary  genres.  He  lived  in  Dresden  from  1801  to  1803 
and  later  from  1819  to  1841  as  councilor  and  drama  critic. 
He  became  a  central  figure  in  the  literary  life  of  the 
city.  During  his  first  stay  in  Dresden,  Tieck  made  no 
fewer  than  twenty-five  visits  to  the  library. 

Influence  of  Dresden  on  Intellectuals 

Heinrich  von  Kleist  (1777-1811)  was  also  living  in  Dresden. 
A  writer  of  international  literary  standing,  he  did  not 
fit  the  aesthetic  system  of  classical  harmony  fostered  by 
Goethe  and  Schiller.  He  saw  the  entanglements  and  fatal¬ 
ism  of  human  existence  in  a  puzzling  world.  Kleist’s  short 
life  was  dominated  by  this  view  of  reality  in  which 
he  sought  in  vain  the  realm  of  the  ideal.  Yet  in  Dresden, 
where  he  found  friends  and  understanding,  he  spent  a 
happy  period  from  31  August  1807  to  29  April  1809.  Earlier, 
in  1801,  he  had  written  from  Paris:  “What’s  happening 
in  my  dear  Dresden?”  When  he  came  to  Dresden,  he  met 
a  remarkable  group  of  prolific  intellectuals.  Adam  Muller 
(1779— 1829),  an  expert  in  many  subjects,  was  giving 
brilliant  lectures  on  German  science  and  literature.  He 
had  written  the  introduction  to  Kleist’s  Amphitryon. 

Many  unpublished  manuscripts  were  circulated  among 
this  group.  The  journal  Phoebus,  founded  by  Muller  on  17 
December  1807,  called  for  “popularizing  all  art  works  of 
the  most  contradictory  forms  and  as  varied  as  they  can  be,” 
to  stimulate  the  advancement  of  ideas.  The  intention 
was  to  test  and  promote  directly  and  radically  the  early 
Romantic  ideal  of  unity  from  multiplicity,  as  in  the  synthe¬ 
sizing  of  opposing  texts.  After  its  initial  success,  the  journal 


The  Literature  of  Romanticism  in  Dresden 


ceased  publication  in  February  1809  after  only  nine  issues, 
because  of  strong  competition  and  a  shortage  of  funds. 
Many  of  the  great  literary  men  of  the  day,  from  Goethe  to 
Christoph  Martin  Wieland,  refused  to  contribute,  causing 
a  decline  in  circulation.  Nevertheless,  Phoebus  was  the  most 
important  literary  journal  focusing  upon  the  aesthetic 
debate  to  be  published  in  Dresden.  Its  particular  value 
lay  in  Kleist’s  original  contributions.  Phoebus  published  the 
powerful  Robert-Guiskard  Fragment,  the  draft  of  a  play 
that  Kleist  intended  as  the  greatest  drama  of  all  time. 

Other  important  drafts  of  his  pioneering  creations  are 
known  largely  through  this  publication. 

Although  he  worked  in  Dessau,  Wilhelm  Muller 
(1794-1827)  frequently  visited  Dresden.  This  Romantic 
folk  writer  composed  simple,  lyrical  poems  that  won  wide 
acceptance,  such  as  “Am  Brunnen  vor  dem  Tore,”  “Das 
Wandern  ist  des  Mullers  Lust,”  and  “Ich  hort  ein  Bachlein 
rauschen.”  His  lyrical  song  cycles,  such  as  Die  schone 
Miillerin  and  Die  Winterreise,  became  the  greatest  songs 
of  composer  Franz  Schubert  (1797-1828),  the  last  master 
of  the  Viennese  classical  school.  These  unexcelled  composi¬ 
tions  embraced  the  content  and  mood  of  Muller’s  poems. 

In  a  letter  of  4  April  1824,  Muller  wrote  about  a  trip 
to  Dresden,  “This  visit  has  already  become  an  annual 
necessity  for  me.”  Two  weeks  later,  he  wrote  further,  “I 
cannot  stand  to  be  away  from  Dresden  longer  than  a  year.” 
He  loved  the  cultural  life  of  this  city,  where  he  had  friends 
such  as  Tieck  and  the  composer  Carl  Maria  von  Weber 
(1786-1826),  a  master  of  Romantic  music.  Muller  dedicat¬ 
ed  the  second  collection  of  his  Waldhorn  songs  to  Weber. 
The  founders  of  the  Dresden  Choral  Society  honored  this 
young  poet.  During  his  numerous  visits  to  the  city,  he 
always  used  the  resources  of  the  Royal  Public  Library,  espe¬ 
cially  while  working  on  his  encyclopedic  fourteen-volume 
Library  of  Seventeenth-century  German  Writers  (1822). 

At  the  library  Muller  had  close  contacts  with  Friedrich 
Adolf  Ebert  (1791-1834),  who  since  1814  had  been  heavily 


involved  in  efforts  to  develop  the  theoretical  and  scientific 
basis  of  library  science.  His  work  Die  Bildung  des 
Bibliothekars  (1820)  is  still  considered  one  of  the  standard 
authorities  in  the  history  of  library  science.  In  1823 
when  Ebert  accepted  the  offer  to  go  to  Wolfenbiittel  to 
take  charge  of  the  library  of  Gotthold  Ephraim  Lessing 
(1729-81),  the  highly  respected  philosopher  of  the 
Enlightenment,  Muller  would  have  liked  to  take  his  place 
in  Dresden  and  wrote,  “May  my  deepest  wish  come  true.” 
His  wish  did  come  true:  Dresden  became  Mullers  second 
home  and  played  a  crucial  role  in  his  development  as 
a  poet.  Today  the  International  Wilhelm  Muller  Society 
preserves  his  work. 

In  late  autumn  of  1828  Friedrich  Schlegel  came  to 
Dresden  for  the  last  time.  While  there,  he  gave  public  lec¬ 
tures  and  wrote  a  summary  of  his  philosophy  of  life.  From 
25  March  to  31  May  he  had  lectured  in  Vienna  on  the 
philosophy  of  life  and  delivered  eighteen  lectures  on  the 
philosophy  of  history.  These  were  challenging  confronta¬ 
tions  with  the  theories  of  the  classical  philosopher  Georg 
Wilhelm  Friedrich  Hegel  (1770-1831).  On  5  December  1828 
Schlegel  began  a  series  of  lectures  at  the  Hotel  de  Pologne 
in  Dresden,  where  Adam  Muller  had  also  lectured.  His 
topic  was  the  philosophy  of  language  and  words.  He  was 
working  on  a  universal  system  of  Christian  philosophy 
when,  on  11  January  1829,  he  suffered  a  heart  attack  while 
reading  the  manuscript  of  his  next  lecture.  He  died  within 
a  few  hours.  The  Dresden  manuscripts  were  sent  to 
Vienna  on  orders  of  the  Austrian  chancellor  Metternich 
(I773_I859)>  who  had  known  and  liked  Schlegel.  Schlegel 
was  buried  in  the  Catholic  cemetery  in  Dresden.  Upon 
receiving  news  of  his  death,  Adam  Muller,  coeditor 
of  Phoebus,  suffered  a  stroke  and  died. 

The  young  Friedrich  Schlegel  had  once  said  in  a 
moment  of  enthusiasm,  “My  feelings  of  youth  were  first 
awakened  in  beautiful  Dresden,  where  I  first  saw  true 
works  of  art.”  In  the  end  he  returned  to  the  city  forever.

Music  in  Saxony 


The  history  of  music  in  Saxony  is  among  the  richest  and 
most  dynamic  in  Germany,  perhaps  in  Europe.  Particularly 
noteworthy  are  Dresden’s  770-year-old  Kreuzchor,  origi¬ 
nally  founded  to  train  choristers  for  church  altar  services, 
and  Leipzig’s  740-year-old  Thomanerchor,  as  well  as 
the  Staatskapelle  of  Dresden  and  the  Leipzig  Gewandhaus 
Orchestra.  Pounded  in  1548  by  Elector  Moritz  to 
accompany  church  services,  the  Staatskapelle  is  the  oldest 
continually  existing  orchestra  of  court  origin  and  is 
considered  one  of  the  leading  European  orchestras  today. 
The  Gewandhaus  Orchestra,  founded  in  1743,  is  the  oldest 
continually  existing  civic  orchestra  in  Europe.  The 
international  acclaim  these  institutions  have  received  is 
the  result  of  the  strong  support  of  music  both  within 
and  outside  the  church  throughout  Saxony  and  of  a  rich 
tradition  of  instrument  making,  especially  in  the 
Vogtland  region  of  southwestern  Saxony. 


Music  and  the  Schools 

For  centuries  music  education  was  emphasized  in  both  the 
Latin  schools  and  the  parochial  schools  of  the  Evangelical 
Lutheran  Church.  In  addition  to  the  large  city  schools 
of  Dresden,  Leipzig,  Zwickau,  Freiberg,  and  other  cities, 


there  were  three  so-called  Fiirstenschulen  (princely  schools), 
Meissen,  Grimma,  and  Pforta,  which  were  established  after 
the  Reformation  by  the  Saxon  electors  on  confiscated 
monastic  estates.  Pforta  became  widely  known  through  the 
publication  of  the  motet  collection,  Florilegium  Portense. 
Part  i  of  the  collection  appeared  in  1618,  part  2  in  1621; 
numerous  copies  of  both  parts  are  still  in  existence  today, 
for  example,  in  the  New  York  Public  Library  and  the 
Library  of  Congress.  Original  music  manuscripts  of  the 
St.  Augustin  School  in  Grimma,  including  several  codices 
of  musical  compositions  from  the  St.  Afra  School  in 
Meissen,  have  been  preserved  and  are  today  part  of  the 
holdings  of  the  Saxon  State  Library. 

Just  as  the  Florilegium  Portense  indicates  the  broad 
scope  of  the  music  repertoire  in  the  city  and  princely 
schools,  the  Grimma  Collection  demonstrates  how  impor¬ 
tant  the  music  centers  of  Leipzig  and  Dresden  became  for 
these  schools.  Today,  musicologists  recognize  how  benefi¬ 
cial  these  manuscripts  were  for  the  musical  development 
of  the  St.  Thomas  Church  before  Bach’s  arrival  in  Leipzig 
in  1723.  Without  this  collection  of  manuscripts,  many 
of  the  earlier  works  of  composers  such  as  Johann 
Rosenmiiller,  Johann  David  Heinichen,  and  Georg  Philipp 
Telemann,  who  lived  temporarily  in  Leipzig,  would  not 
have  survived. 

Music  in  Leipzig 

In  Leipzig,  musical  life  for  centuries  was  centered  in  the 
city’s  churches  and  university.  Liturgical  music  reached 
its  height  in  the  work  and  influence  of  Johann  Sebastian 
Bach,  cantor  of  St.  Thomas  Church  and  director  of  music 
for  Leipzig  from  1723  to  1750.  After  his  appointment 
as  cantor,  Bach  composed  five  complete  cycles  of  cantatas 
for  the  church  calendar,  containing  approximately  sixty 
cantatas  each,  for  a  total  of  almost  three  hundred  sacred 
works,  a  repertoire  unparalleled  in  Leipzig’s  musical 
history. 

Leipzig  was  also  known  for  its  Collegium  Musicum, 
founded  by  Telemann  and  directed  by  Bach  in  1729. 

Such  groups  were  voluntary  associations  of  professional 
musicians  and  university  students  that  gave  weekly  public 


concerts.  In  this  way,  many  an  aspiring  lawyer  or  theolo¬ 
gian  discovered  during  his  studies  at  Leipzig  that  his  real 
vocation  was  music.  A  seventeenth-century  example  is 
Heinrich  Schiitz.  Eighteenth-century  examples  include 
Johann  David  Heinichen,  who  later  became 
Hofkapellmeister  of  the  Dresden  Hofkapelle;  Johann 
Friedrich  Fasch,  later  Hofkapellmeister  in  Zerbst;  Georg 
Philipp  Telemann,  who  became  a  conductor  in  Frankfurt 
am  Main  and  Hamburg;  and  the  Dresden  concert-master 
Johann  Georg  Pisendel.  Several  of  Bach’s  successors  as 
music  director  at  the  St.  Thomas  Church  were  also  gradu¬ 
ates  of  law  and  theology  from  Leipzig  University.  Among 
the  nineteenth-century  graduates  were  the  composers 
Heinrich  Marschner  and  Carl  Gottlieb  Reiftiger,  who 
were  later  in  Dresden,  as  was  Robert  Schumann. 

Music  in  Dresden 

In  the  capital  city  of  Dresden,  the  Hofkapelle  had  such 
high  standing  that  the  other  musical  groups  in  Saxony 
could  not  seriously  compete  with  it,  although  some  of 
them  were  also  excellent.  When  the  Saxon  electors  were 
invited  to  the  Reichstag  in  Berlin,  they  took  along  their 
celebrated  Hofkapelle.  It  participated  in  festivals, 
weddings,  and  state  occasions,  events  that  were  accompa¬ 
nied  by  sports  tournaments,  lavish  opera  productions, 
and  processions  in  fancy  costumes. 

The  Hofkapelle  also  played  regularly  at  the  court 
worship  services.  It  had  been  founded  in  1548  as  the  earliest 
Lutheran  (court)  ensemble,  under  the  leadership  of  church 
music  director  and  Hofkapellmeister  Johann  Walter.  When 
Elector  Friedrich  August  I  (August  the  Strong,  d.  1733) 
converted  to  Catholicism  in  1697  in  order  to  become  king 
of  Poland,  some  members  left  the  Hofkapelle  for  religious 
reasons,  since  the  ensemble  would  now  be  integrated  into 
the  Catholic  worship  services.  At  the  same  time  the  old 
organizational  form  of  the  Hofkapelle  that  had  developed 
under  Schiitz  was  changed  to  a  more  modern  form. 
Obsolete  instruments  gave  way  to  new  ones  that  are  still 
in  use  today. 

Essential  to  this  early  development  was  the  interna¬ 
tional  character  of  the  Hofkapelle.  From  its  beginning,  it 


Dresden:  Treasures  from  the  Saxon  State  Library 


had  drawn  conductors,  as  well  as  members,  from  Italy, 
the  Netherlands,  and  England.  When  the  electors  traveled 
to  other  countries,  such  as  Italy  or  France,  they  adopted 
new  musical  developments  that  they  observed  in  their  jour¬ 
neys.  In  1685  Johann  Georg  III  (d.  1691)  brought  back 
from  a  trip  a  prima  donna  whom  he  had  lured  away  from 
the  service  of  the  duke  of  Mantua.  This  represented  a 
dramatic  change  for  the  Holkapelle,  since  until  this  time 
female  stage  roles  had  been  played  and  sung  by  men  (either 
in  falsetto  or  in  the  naturally  high  voices  of  castrati). 

Outside  the  church  the  Hofkapelle’s  vocalists  and 
instrumentalists  participated  increasingly  in  court  concerts 
and  theater  performances,  such  as  Daphne  by  Martin  Opitz 
and  Heinrich  Schiitz  in  1627.  Opera  performances  were 
especially  well  received  in  Dresden,  as  they  are  to  this  day. 
From  1662  to  1816  opera  was  sung  almost  exclusively  in 
Italian  at  the  Dresden  court;  performances  in  French  were 
rare,  and  German  performances  took  place  only  after  the 
German  Opera  opened  in  1817.  Italian  opera  in  Dresden 
reached  its  zenith  under  the  direction  of  Johann  Adolf 
Hasse  (1734-63).  The  nineteenth-century  German  Opera, 
best  known  as  the  Hofoper,  had  two  outstanding  periods 
influenced  respectively  by  the  tenure  as  Hofkapellmeister 
of  Carl  Maria  von  Weber  (1817-26)  and  Richard  Wagner 
(1842-49). 

For  centuries  the  brilliant  reputation  of  the  Dresden 
Hofkapelle  attracted  renowned  soloists,  such  as  violinists 
Johann  Georg  Pisendel,  Antonio  Rolla,  and  Karol  Lipinski; 
cellists  Friedrich  Dotzauer,  Friedrich  August  Kummer,  and 
Friedrich  Griitzmacher;  flutists  Pierre-Gabriel  Buffardin, 
Johann  Joachim  Quantz,  and  Anton  Bernhard  Fiirstenau; 
and  oboists  Johann  Christian  Richter  and  Antonio  and 
Carlo  Besozzi.  The  Dresden  musicians  were  also  sought- 
after  teachers.  Great  works  on  music  instruction  were 
written  by  the  conductors  Giovanni  Andrea  Bontempi 
(Dresden,  1660),  Christoph  Bernhard  (a  work  that  survives 
in  a  seventeenth-century  manuscript),  and  Johann  David 
Heinichen.  Heinichen’s  Basso  Continuo  in  Music  (Dresden, 
1728)  is  still  considered  the  standard  work  on  the  subject. 
Other  important  instructional  works  include  Quantz’s 
On  Playing  the  Flute  (published  in  Berlin  in  1752,  but 
mainly  reflecting  Dresden  orchestra  practice)  and  Moritz 
Fiirstenau’s  still  unsurpassed  History  of  the  Theater  and 


Music  at  the  Dresden  Court  (1861-62),  the  earliest  local 
history  of  such  scope. 

The  conductor  Michael  Praetorius  had  relied  on 
the  instruments  of  the  Dresden  Hofkapelle  in  his  descrip¬ 
tion  of  common  and  rare  musical  instruments  for  his 
Syntagma  musicum  (1615-20).  Similarly,  in  1910-n  a  group 
from  the  Dresden  Hofkapelle  published  a  more  general 
three-volume  work,  Musical  Instruments  in  Word 
and  Picture,  edited  by  E.  Teuchert  and  E.  W.  Haupt. 

Saxony’s  Music  Publishing  Industry  and  Depositories 

A  lively  music-publishing  industry  developed  as  a  result 
of  the  musical  works  produced  in  Saxony.  Leipzig,  with  its 
long-standing  tradition  of  book  publishing  and  book  fairs, 
gradually  became  the  center  of  music  publishing.  Such 
famous  publishers  as  Breitkopf  &  Hartel  and  C.  F.  Peters 
were  located  in  Leipzig.  Although  there  was  considerable 
competition  among  the  well-schooled  Dresden  court 
copyists  in  the  field  of  hand-copied  music,  Leipzig 
in  the  eighteenth  century  achieved  a  leading  position 
in  music  publishing  and  it  continued  to  enlarge  its 
dominance  of  the  market  until  the  end  of  the  nineteenth 
century.  There  was  hardly  a  publishing  house  from  Russia 
to  the  United  States  that  did  not  have  its  musical  works 
printed  in  Leipzig. 

This  prodigious  output  of  hand-copied  and  printed 
music  posed  a  problem  for  storage  and  cataloging.  For  this 
reason,  during  the  nineteenth  century  large  scholarly 
libraries  became  depositories  for  historical  music  material. 
Often  the  works  had  passed  through  the  hands  of  private 
collectors  and  were  donated  to  or  purchased  by  the 
libraries. 

In  1816  the  noted  librarian  Friedrich  Adolf  Ebert 
established  a  Music  Department  at  the  Royal  Public 
Library  in  Saxony,  now  the  Saxon  State  Library.  A  special 
catalog  lists  the  impressive  original  collection,  which  was 
later  enhanced  by  donations  of  entire  collections.  In  1890 
the  library  received  several  music  collections  from  Saxon 
churches,  city  archives,  and  schools;  these  were  followed 
in  1897  by  the  splendid  private  music  collection  of  the 
Saxon  kings,  dating  primarily  from  the  eighteenth  and

nineteenth  centuries.  Unfortunately,  the  Hofkapelle’s 
archives  from  the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth  centuries, 
which  included  music  materials  by  Heinrich  Schiitz 
written  in  his  own  hand,  were  destroyed  in  the  Prussian 
bombardment  of  Dresden  in  1760. 

In  the  twentieth  century  the  collection  was  further 
enlarged  by  music  materials  from  the  royal,  church,  and 
opera  collections;  the  Grimma  and  Zittau  collections; 
and  the  Annaberg  choirbooks.  During  World  War  II 
bombs  destroyed  most  of  the  contemporary  music  collec¬ 
tion  of  the  Saxon  State  Library.  After  the  war,  however, 
the  library  once  again  began  to  collect  the  work  of  contem¬ 
porary  composers.  The  primary  emphasis  continues  to 
be  on  original  manuscripts  by  Saxon  composers  and  on 
compositions  that  either  received  their  premiere  in 
Dresden  or  have  other  ties  to  Dresden  or  Saxony.  As  long 
as  the  library  maintains  this  high  standard  for  collecting 
Saxony’s  musical  heritage,  its  renowned  position  in  the 
world  of  music  will  be  secure.

Machsor  mechol  haschana.  (Jewish  Holy  Day  Prayer  Book 
for  the  Whole  Year.)  Germany,  c.  1290.  Vellum. 

Moses  receives  the  Ten  Commandments  and  presents 
them  to  the  people. 

This  magnificent  manuscript  is  a  testimony  to  German 
Jewry  of  the  Middle  Ages.  Machsorim  (cycles)  are  the 
special  prayer  books  for  Sabbath  and  other  holy  days. 

The  Dresden  manuscript  contains  prayers  for  the  Feast 


of  Weeks,  Passover,  and  the  feast  commemorating  the 
deliverance  of  the  Jews  from  a  Persian  plot,  along  with 
poetry  by  Rabbi  Meir  von  Rothenburg  (1215-93)  and  the 
renowned  Hebrew  poet  Juda  Halevi  (1075-1141).  Part  2 
of  this  work,  containing  prayers  for  the  remaining  holy 
days,  is  located  in  Wroclaw,  Poland.  Both  parts  were 
written  by  Reuben,  a  pupil  of  Rabbi  Meir,  probably  in 
Esslingen.  The  beautiful  miniatures  by  an  anonymous 
Gentile  illuminator  are  painted  in  Christian  Gothic  style.

Petrarca,  Francesco:  Des  remedes  de  l’une  et  l’autre

mid-fifteenth  century.  Vellum. 

Scholar  and  disciple  at  home. 

In  1365  the  renowned  Italian  poet  Francesco  Petrarca 
(1304—74)  wrote  Of  Remedies  for  Fortune  Fair  and  Foul,  in 
which  he  offers  advice,  in  the  form  of  dialogues  between 
Reason  and  Agony,  on  thinking  clearly  in  times  of  happi¬ 
ness  and  sorrow.  The  Dresden  manuscript,  containing 


Jean  Daudin’s  translation,  is  dedicated  to  King  Charles  VII 
and  is  an  outstanding  example  of  Flemish  fifteenth-century 
workmanship,  with  its  delicate  gold  initials  and  arabesques. 
Especially  outstanding  are  the  two  miniatures,  the  early 
work  of  Jacques  de  Besamjon.  Before  it  was  acquired  for 
the  Dresden  collection  in  1725,  the  manuscript  had  several 
illustrious  French  owners:  Jacques  d’Armagnac,  count  of 
Nemours  (d.  1477),  Antoine  de  Bourgogne  (d.  1564),  and 
Countess  Anne  Henriette  de  Conde  (d.  1723).

Boccaccio,  Giovanni:  Des  cas  des  nobles  hommes  et 
femmes.  (Of  the  Fate  of  Illustrious  Men  and  Women.) 
France,  c.  1520.  Vol.  2.  Vellum. 

Boccaccio  and  his  audience. 

Though  he  is  today  better  known  for  his  Decameron,  until 
the  middle  of  the  sixteenth  century  Giovanni  Boccaccio 
was  most  famous  for  his  work  Of  the  Fate  of  Illustrious  Men 
and  Women.  Using  biblical,  classical,  and  mythological 
examples,  he  shows  how  a  change  in  fortune  can  destroy 


even  the  powerful.  Written  around  1360,  this  work  was 
soon  translated  into  all  the  major  European  languages. 
Volumes  2-5  of  the  magnificent  manuscript  date  from  1520 
and  show  that  handwritten  manuscripts  were  produced  for 
the  wealthy  and  powerful  even  after  the  invention  of  print¬ 
ing.  The  dedicatory  inscription  indicates  that  Charles 
de  Bourbon  gave  the  volumes  to  King  Francis  I  of  France. 
Two  hundred  years  later,  they  were  presented  to  the  Saxon 
elector  Augustus  the  Strong  by  Prince  Karol  Stanisfaw 
Radziwifh

Gaffurius  (Gafori),  Franchinus:  Practica  Musicae. 

(The  Performance  of  Music.)  Milan,  1496.  Printed 
on  vellum. 

Choir  and  musical  cherubs. 

From  1451  to  1522  Franchinus  Gaffurius,  the  highly  educat¬ 
ed  conductor  of  Milan  Cathedral,  was  considered  the 
authority  on  musical  theory.  During  his  lifetime  his  text¬ 
book  Practica  Musicae  was  published  in  six  editions.  He 
greatly  influenced  music  theory  by  relating  theory  and 
practice  and  by  enhancing  the  application  of  intervals  and 


musical  notation.  The  second  and  fourth  editions  (Brescia, 
1497  and  1508)  became  items  4  and  5  in  the  newly  estab¬ 
lished  Music  Department  of  the  library.  Today  they  are 
rarer  than  the  first  edition.  A  fine  copy  of  the  first  edition 
was  purchased  by  then  librarian  Falkenstein,  who  com¬ 
mented  on  its  connection  with  the  library:  “Francesco 
Morlacchi,  the  last  conductor  of  the  Italian  Opera  House 
in  Dresden,  sold  this  copy  to  the  Konigliche  Bibliothek 
in  September  1841  shortly  before  departing  for  Italy  to  cure 
his  consumption.  He  was  not  to  reach  his  goal:  he  died 
October  28  in  Innsbruck.”

Durer,  Albrecht:  Passio  Domini  Nostri  Jesu.  (The

The  artistic  legacy  of  Albrecht  Durer  (1471-1528)  includes 
not  only  his  work  as  a  painter,  graphic  artist,  and  drafts¬ 
man,  but  also  his  work  as  an  art  historian.  This  sketchbook 
contains  the  master’s  original  drawings  and  his  autograph 
manuscript  of  book  1  of  his  Proportionslehre  (Guidelines  for 
Proportions).  This  treasure  contains  three  woodcut  series: 
the  life  of  the  Virgin  Mary,  the  Passion  of  Jesus  Christ, 


and  the  Apocalypse.  Created  over  a  period  of  time  (the 
leaf  on  display,  for  example,  dates  between  1496  and  1499), 
they  were  first  gathered  in  one  volume  and  printed  with 
the  Latin  verses  of  Benedict  Chelidonius  in  1511.  The 
Dresden  exemplar  owes  its  special  charm  to  the  colorful 
floral  border  and  its  illumination  probably  done  in 
Diirer’s  workshop.

Theuerdank’s  horse  being  hit  by  a  bullet. 

Emperor  Maximilian  I  (1459— 1519)  created  a  literary  monu¬ 
ment  to  himself  with  his  poem  Theuerdank,  the  only  one 
of  several  planned  literary  works  to  be  completed  and  pub¬ 
lished  during  his  lifetime.  No  other  book  of  the  time 
compares  with  it  in  typographic  and  artistic  workmanship. 
Conceived  by  the  emperor  himself  and  written  with  the 


assistance  of  the  court  poet,  Melchior  Pfinzing,  this  allegori¬ 
cal  poem  in  the  tradition  of  the  heroic  epics  describes  the 
young  Maximilian’s  courtship  of  Maria,  heiress  to 
Burgundy.  It  is  one  of  the  earliest  books  written  in  Fraktur 
and  is  enhanced  by  woodcuts  by  the  artists  Hans 
Burgkmair,  Hans  Schaufelein,  and  Leonhard  Beck,  depict¬ 
ing  everyday  life  at  the  beginning  of  the  sixteenth  century.

Elector  Friedrich  the  Wise. 

The  study  of  Martin  Luther  and  the  Reformation  also 
involves  considering  the  role  of  Elector  Friedrich  the  Wise 
(1463-1525).  He  was  a  man  of  profound  religious  beliefs  and 


broad  education  with  extensive  interests  in  theology,  history, 
and  jurisprudence.  His  court  was  a  vital  center  of  humanis¬ 
tic  studies,  the  arts,  and  music.  In  1502  he  founded  the 
University  of  Wittenberg,  where  Luther  became  a  professor 
in  1512.  The  elector  granted  Luther  protection  while  publicly 
remaining  neutral.  In  1521  he  provided  Luther  safe-conduct 
to  the  imperial  Diet  in  Worms  and  provided  him  asylum 
at  Wartburg  Castle  at  the  risk  of  endangering  his  own  state. 
The  elector’s  politics  allowed  the  Reformation  to  spread.

Luther,  Martin:  Autograph  letter  to  Duchess  Katharina 
of  Saxony.  Wittenberg,  28  July  1539. 

Duke  Georg,  ruler  of  the  Albertinian  part  of  Saxony 
(1471 — 1539),  successfully  opposed  Luther’s  Reformation  in 
his  state.  However,  his  successor  and  younger  brother, 
Heinrich  (1473— 1541),  sympathized  with  the  Reformation, 
supported  by  his  wife  Duchess  Katharina  (1487—1561), 


who  had  for  years  been  one  of  Luther’s  followers.  The 
Reformation  now  proceeded  in  the  duchy  of  Saxony, 
though  with  resistance  in  Leipzig  on  the  part  of  monks, 
university  theologians,  and  some  members  of  the  city 
council.  Luther’s  letter  of  28  July  1539,  opening  with  the 
words,  “...  because  my  esteemed  Lord  Duke  Heinrich  [is] 
old  and  frail  ...,”  sought  Katharina’s  support  for  the 
implementation  of  the  Reformation  in  the  duchy.

Biblia.  (The  Bible.)  Venice,  1479.  Printed  on  vellum. 

The  creation  of  man,  the  Fall,  and  the  expulsion 
from  Paradise. 

Venice’s  reputation  as  an  early  printing  center  was  above  all 
based  on  the  works  of  Nikolaus  Jenson,  who  from  147° 
until  his  death  in  1480  printed  ninety-eight  known  works, 
primarily  classical  works  and  legal  and  theological  litera¬ 


ture.  His  Antiqua  type,  which  recreates  the  letter  forms 
of  Roman  inscriptions  in  modern  print,  is  considered  the 
perfect  embodiment  of  humanistic  ideals.  This  vellum 
printing  of  a  1479  Bible  is  an  outstanding  incunabulum.  In 
the  Dresden  exemplar  the  major  initials  are  illuminated, 
with  the  smaller  ones  in  red  and  blue.  The  two  leaves  with 
miniatures  are  precious,  especially  that  showing  several 
themes  from  Genesis.

Biblia  deutsch.  Ubersetzt  von  Martin  Luther.  (The  Bible  in 
German.  Translated  by  Martin  Luther.)  Wittenberg,  1534. 

Title  page  of  the  first  complete  Bible  in  Luther’s 
translation. 

This  Bible  is  considered  one  of  Martin  Luther’s  (1483-1546) 
greatest  linguistic  accomplishments.  He  first  translated 
the  New  Testament  in  1522.  His  translation  of  the  Old 
Testament  was  interrupted  by  political  upheaval  and  was 
published  in  parts  until  1534.  Luther  united  the  separate 


sections  into  a  complete  Bible  and  thoroughly  revised  the 
text  with  the  assistance  of  the  Wittenberg  scholars  Philipp 
Melanchthon,  Justus  Jonas,  and  Caspar  Cruciger.  The  work 
was  richly  illustrated  with  historiated  initials  and  117 
woodcuts  from  the  workshop  of  Lucas  Cranach  and  shows 
Luther’s  strong  influence  on  its  pictorial  themes.  It  was 
completed  in  September  1534  and  sold  at  the  Leipzig  fair 
that  October  for  2  guilders,  8  groschen  for  an  unbound 
copy.  For  comparison,  a  schoolmaster  of  the  time  earned 
approximately  4  guilders  annually.

Biblia  Germanico-Latina.  (German-Latin  Bible.) 
Wittenberg,  1565.  Printed  on  vellum. 

Saxon  elector  Augustus. 

In  numerous  manuscripts  and  books  is  the  statement  that 
they  were  written  or  printed  “by  order  of”  Elector  Augustus 
(1526-86).  Thus,  in  1565  he  had  printed  in  Wittenberg  at 
his  expense  this  twenty-volume  Bible  in  Latin  and  German, 
partly  on  vellum,  and  richly  decorated  with  colored 
miniatures  and  initials.  In  each  volume  is  an  illuminated 


woodcut  portrait  of  the  elector  after  a  painting  by  Lucas 
Cranach  the  Younger.  Several  sets,  beautifully  bound,  were 
given  to  friendly  princes.  Displayed  here  is  the  private 
copy  of  Elector  Augustus,  which  includes  a  unique  vellum 
sheet  with  the  inscription:  “His  lordship  the  elector  of 
Saxony  began  reading  this  Bible  on  June  9  in  the  year  [15)85 
and  finished  on  August  23  of  the  same  year.  It  took  ten 
weeks  and  five  days.”

Kentmann,  Johannes:  Krauterbuch. 

(Book  of  Herbs.)  1563. 

Red  apples  from  the  New  World  (, tomato  plants). 
Johannes  Kentmann  (1518-74)  was  the  typical  sixteenth- 
century  German  scientist.  Born  in  Dresden,  he  studied 
in  Leipzig  and  Wittenberg,  and  in  Bologna,  Italy,  where 
he  earned  his  doctorate  in  medicine  and  surgery.  In  his 
long  career  as  a  principal  physician  at  Torgau,  he  wrote 


on  many  scientific  subjects.  In  1563,  commissioned 
by  Elector  August,  he  compiled  his  Krauterbuch  (Book 
of  Herbs),  a  systematic  arrangement  of  approximately 
600  illustrations  of  trees,  bushes,  shrubs,  and  domestic 
and  wild  plants,  executed  by  the  Torgau  artist,  David 
Redtel.  The  Krauterbuch  was  never  printed,  and  this 
unique  manuscript  remains  a  treasure  of  the  Saxon 
State  Library.

Mair,  Paulus  Hector:  Fecht-,  Ring-  und  Turnierbuch. 
(Book  of  Fencing,  Wrestling,  and  Jousting.)  Mid-sixteenth 
century. 

Duel  with  long  swords. 

In  the  Middle  Ages  fencing  and  wrestling  were  not  only 
exercises  for  war  preparation  but  also  a  favorite  art  form  at 
social  events  for  the  nobility  and  the  city  society.  Fencing 
and  wrestling  champions  traveled  from  town  to  town 


participating  in  exhibition  bouts  and  giving  lessons.  Books 
on  these  subjects  were  popular,  particularly  in  the  sixteenth 
century.  Even  Albrecht  Diirer  wrote  a  work  on  fencing. 
This  manuscript  by  Paulus  Hector  Mair  (1517-79)  contains 
242  vivid  illustrations  depicting  duels  with  swords,  with 
halberds,  and  even  with  toothed  sickles.  The  author  died 
a  tragic  death:  after  forty-four  years  in  service  to  the  city 
of  Augsburg,  he  was  hanged  for  misappropriation  of 
public  funds.

Senftenberg,  Veit  Wolff  von:  Kriegserfindungen. 
(Military  Inventions.)  Second  half  of  sixteenth  century. 

Mining  of  a  fortress. 

Military  historians  consider  Veit  Wolff  von  Senftenberg  a 
leading  authority  on  artillery  of  his  day.  Around  1570  he 
wrote  Kriegserfindungen  (Military  Inventions),  based  on  his 
own  experience  and  designed  to  help  defeat  the  Turks, 


from  whose  attacks  Senftenberg  himself  had  suffered. 

To  assure  secrecy  he  did  not  allow  the  work  to  be  printed. 
This  Dresden  copy,  a  parchment  manuscript  with  informa¬ 
tive,  colorful  pictures,  describes  the  different  weapons 
and  their  most  effective  use.  In  fighting  the  Turks,  poison¬ 
ing  the  water  supply  was  considered  permissible  and  an 
effective  and  secure  communication  network  was  essential.

Loeneyss,  Georg  Engelhart:  Griindlicher  Bericht 
und  Ordnung  der  Gebisse.  (Thorough  Report  on 
Equestrian  Dentistry.)  1576. 

A  young  stallion  and  the  bit. 

This  manuscript,  magnificently  bound  by  Jakob  Krause, 
belonged  to  Elector  August’s  private  library.  The  author  was 
from  1523  to  1584  both  the  elector’s  equerry  and  the  person 


responsible  for  arranging  all  official  court  functions. 

His  Della  cavalleria,  continually  reprinted  into  the  eigh¬ 
teenth  century,  was  the  summation  of  his  experience 
in  these  fields.  The  Dresden  manuscript  depicts  not  only 
the  numerous  horse  bits,  reins,  muzzles,  and  grooming 
implements,  but  also  the  horses  themselves,  outfitted  with 
saddles,  ornamental  harnesses,  and  blankets,  and 
a  complete  tournament.

Harriot,  Thomas:  Customs  of  the  Savages  in  Virginia. 
Frankfurt  am  Main,  1590. 

Indian  settlement. 

Thomas  Harriot  (1560-1621)  was  official  surveyor  for 
the  expedition  led  by  Sir  Richard  Grenville  in  1585-86  to 
Roanoke  Island  off  the  coast  of  present-day  North 
Carolina.  This  German  edition,  published  in  Frankfurt  by 
Theodor  de  Bry  in  1590,  two  years  after  the  first  edition 


appeared  in  London,  was  dedicated  by  the  publisher  to 
Saxon  elector  Christian  I  (1560—91).  Harriot  presents  a  vivid 
picture  of  the  conditions  he  observed  in  this  part  of  the 
New  World,  especially  the  natural  resources  and  their  possi¬ 
ble  use  by  English  settlers,  as  well  as  the  habits  and  customs 
of  the  native  inhabitants.  The  twenty-three  full-page 
engravings,  after  originals  by  the  Dutch  artist  Johann  With, 
and  hand  colored  in  the  Dresden  exemplar,  add  to  the 
value  of  this  work.

Sled  with  astronomer. 

In  1602  the  Dresden  painter  Daniel  Bretschneider  presented 
Elector  Christian  II  with  several  designs  for  sleds.  He  was 
awarded  50  guilders  for  his  efforts.  Emulating  the  great 
courts  of  France,  Italy,  England,  and  Spain,  the  Saxon  rulers 


used  sleds  of  the  best  design  in  opulent  pageants.  Birthdays, 
weddings,  baptisms,  and  carnivals  were  occasions  to 
stage  such  events,  which  often  had  biblical,  mythological, 
and  exotic  themes,  as  well  as  everyday  motifs  celebrating 
the  trades  of  Saxony,  such  as  the  mining  industry.  These 
pageants  played  an  important  role  in  enhancing  the  ruler’s 
image  before  his  subjects  and  other  rulers.  This  custom  is 
well  documented,  in  part  by  the  survival  of  so  many  Saxon 
illustrated  manuscripts  of  the  sixteenth-eighteenth  centuries.

Tierhatz  auf  dem  Altmarkt  zu  Dresden.  (Animal  Chase  in

The  boar  chase. 

The  event  documented  in  this  illustrated  manuscript 
appears  bizarre  to  us  today.  Eight  large  leaves  depict  the 
Altmarkt  in  Dresden  at  carnival  time,  entirely  surrounded 
by  buildings,  with  the  City  Hall  (Rathaus)  to  the  north. 


Animals,  including  deer,  boar,  bears,  wolves,  rabbits, 
wildcats,  foxes  and  raccoons,  were  brought  in,  chased,  and 
killed  before  hundreds  of  spectators.  The  show,  in  this  case 
a  boar  hunt,  culminated  in  a  battle  between  bears  and 
bulls.  Such  public  chases  offered  city  dwellers  the 
opportunity  to  experience  the  thrill  of  the  hunt  enjoyed 
for  centuries  by  the  court.

Division  Tables,  c.  1570.  Binding  by  Jakob  Krause,  with 
electoral  coat  of  arms. 

Shortly  after  Elector  August  began  collecting  books, 
he  hired  Jakob  Krause,  one  of  the  best  Renaissance  book¬ 
binders.  Krause  (1526/27-85)  was  born  in  Zwickau.  After 
completing  his  bookbinding  apprenticeship,  he  improved 
his  skills  in  Wittenberg  and  in  France.  He  served  for  several 
years  as  a  binder  to  the  renowned  merchant  house  of 
Fugger  in  Augsburg.  In  1566  he  came  to  Dresden,  where 


he  eventually  produced  more  than  a  thousand  magnificent 
bindings.  In  addition,  he  purchased  books  for  the  elector, 
visiting  the  trade  fairs  in  Frankfurt  and  Leipzig.  Krause’s 
bindings  are  distinguished  by  meticulous  workmanship  and 
rich  decoration.  They  exemplify  German  bookbinding  style 
as  practiced  in  Wittenberg,  but  incorporating  French, 
Italian,  and  oriental  motifs,  which  Krause  merged  with  his 
own  style.  This  example  shows  his  skill  in  ornamentation 
and  chasing.

the  outstanding  bookbinders  in  Saxony,  along  with 
Jakob  Krause  and  Caspar  Meuser  (see  figures  19  and  21). 
All  that  is  known  of  him  is  that  he  worked  in  Dresden

Caspar  Meuser  (1550-93)  was  an  apprentice  of  Jakob 
Krause  and,  from  1574,  Krause’s  successor  in  the  court 
bindery.  He  used  the  panels  and  stamps  designed  by 
Krause,  but  evolved  his  own  style,  characterized  by  profuse 
vinework.  This  heart-shaped  prayerbook,  designed  for 
Anna,  the  wife  of  Elector  August,  is  a  particularly  fine 
example  of  his  artistry.

Procession  with  members  of  the  Hofkapelle

The  Dresden  court  had  a  long  and  splendid  tradition

of  the  Hofkapelle  not  only  performed  as  musicians  in  the 
festival  processions,  but  also  dressed  in  lavish  costumes  as 
actors.  The  item  on  display,  originally  a  scroll  and  later 
bound  in  book  form,  describes  the  ceremonies  on  the  occa¬ 
sion  of  an  electoral  wedding.  Elector  August  is  preceded 
here  by  enchained  figures  representing  Death,  the  Devil, 
Justice,  two  Heralds,  and  the  Muses.  Members  of  the 
Hofkapelle  with  their  instruments  can  be  identified  in  the 
procession.  The  instruments  were  described  a  generation 
later  by  Michael  Praetorius  in  his  Syntagma  musicum.

Biblia.  Ubersetzt  von  Martin  Luther.  (The  Bible.  Translated 
by  Martin  Luther.)  Nuremberg,  1652. 

Bible  of  Elector  Moritz  of  Sachsen-Zeitz,  with  his 
coat  of  arms. 

The  velvet-bound  Bible  on  display  is  an  example  of  the 
book  treasures  that  came  to  the  Dresden  Court  Library. 

The  head  of  the  Albertinian  line,  Elector  Johann  Georg  I, 
proclaimed  that  upon  his  death  Saxony  should  be 


divided  among  his  four  sons.  His  youngest  son,  Moritz 
(1619—81),  became  the  ruler  of  the  new  duchy  of  Sachsen- 
Zeitz.  Although  this  may  have  been  a  politically  dubious 
decision,  the  duchy  benefited  culturally.  The  new 
duke’s  dynamic  building  program  soon  remedied  the 
destruction  caused  by  the  Thirty  Years’  War.  Moritz 
Castle  (Moritzburg)  in  Zeitz  was  an  early  example 
of  baroque  architecture.  The  duke  also  supported  the 
arts  and  music.

Atlas  Royal.  Yol.  i.  Amsterdam,  1707. 

Queen  Anne  of  England. 

This  unique  atlas  testifies  to  both  the  love  of  splendor  and 
the  interest  in  science  of  August  the  Strong  (1670-1733). 
The  atlas  was  produced  for  him  in  Amsterdam,  once 
the  center  of  the  map  trade,  in  1706-10.  In  nineteen  large- 
format  morocco  volumes,  the  atlas  contains  roughly  1,400 
beautifully  illuminated,  printed  or  hand-drawn  leaves 


(maps,  views,  plans,  portraits),  primarily  of  Dutch  and 
French — less  often  of  Italian,  English,  or  German — 
origin  dating  to  the  seventeenth  and  early  eighteenth 
centuries.  The  volume  on  display  contains  fifty  priceless, 
masterfully  tinted  engravings,  depicting  English  court 
dress  around  1700.

Poppelmann,  Matthaus  Daniel:  Entwurf  fur  einen 
Zwingerpavillon.  (Draft  for  a  Zwinger  pavilion.) 

Dresden,  1712-13. 

The  Dresden  Zwinger,  a  masterpiece  of  baroque  architec¬ 
ture,  would  have  been  inconceivable  without  the  initiative 
and  influence  of  August  the  Strong.  Two  of  the  fore¬ 
most  artists  of  the  era,  the  architect  Matthaus  Daniel 
Poppelmann  (1662-1736)  and  the  sculptor  Balthasar 
Permoser  (1651-1732),  executed  his  concept.  Initially, 


the  project  was  to  involve  merely  the  construction  of  an 
orangery  in  the  Zwinger  section  of  the  fortress  complex. 

But  the  plans  grew  more  elaborate  in  conjunction  with 
the  proposed  construction  of  a  new  castle.  Original  plans 
in  the  Saxon  State  Library  show  the  grand  scale  of  the  over¬ 
all  concept,  of  which  only  the  Zwinger  was  realized,  in 
modified  form.  The  rampart  shown  here  as  a  rectangular 
structure,  for  example,  was  ultimately  built  in  a  more 
graceful  oval  form.

Manuscript  score. 

From  his  arrival  in  Dresden  in  1717,  Bach  maintained  life¬ 
long  contact  with  the  court  and  the  Hofkapelle,  where 
the  highest  musical  standards  found  expression.  After  the 
death  of  Hofkapellmeister  Heinichen  in  1729  and  the 
appointment  of  J.  A.  Hasse  as  his  replacement,  Bach  (who 


was  not  considered  for  the  position  for  religious  reasons) 
applied  for  a  court  appointment.  To  his  application  he 
appended  a  part  of  his  Mass  in  B  Minor.  Pressed  for  time, 
Bach  enlisted  his  wife  and  eldest  son  in  transcribing  the 
work.  The  date  of  the  first  Dresden  performance  of  this 
brilliant  work  has  never  been  determined.  Flowever,  since 
1736  the  cantor  of  the  St.  Thomas  Church  in  Leipzig  has 
carried  the  title  of  “composer  to  the  court  of  the  king  of 
Poland  and  the  elector  of  Saxony.”

Jasmine  bush  with  butterfly  and  snake. 

In  1699  a  woman  set  out  on  a  journey.  Her  destination 
was  unusual  and  her  purpose  even  more  so:  Maria  Sibylla 
Merian  (1647-1717)  journeyed  from  Holland  to  Surinam 
to  study  and  depict  insects.  The  results  of  her  two-year 
stay  in  the  jungle  were  published  in  1705  in  a  large-format 
folio,  which  earned  her  a  place  of  honor  among 
naturalists.  Trained  as  a  painter  and  obsessed  with 
a  desire  for  knowledge,  she  studied  and  drew  the  insects 


in  their  various  developmental  stages  and  the  plants  she 
found  them  on.  The  Saxon  State  Library  is  fortunate 
to  own  one  of  the  few  surviving  copies  of  Merian’s  work, 
one  colored  by  the  author-artist  herself.

Plans  et  elevations  des  differentes  eglises.  (Plans  and 
Elevations  of  Various  Churches.)  First  half  of  eighteenth 
century. 

Original  cross-sectional  drawing  of  the  Frauenkirche 
by  Georg  Bdhr. 

Known  as  the  Stone  Bell,  the  dome  of  the  Frauenkirche 
rose  above  the  inner  city  of  Dresden  for  more  than  two 
centuries  until  it  collapsed  during  the  bombing  at  the  end 
of  World  War  II.  A  serious  commitment  has  recently  been 
made  to  rebuild  this  most  important  example  of  Protestant 
church  architecture,  giving  hope  that  the  cherished 
landmark  will  once  again  dominate  Dresden’s  skyline  by 


the  city’s  eight-hundredth  anniversary  in  200 6.  The  church 
is  the  work  of  Georg  Bahr  (1666-1738),  one  of  the  great 
German  baroque  builders,  noted  for  his  unique  style  in 
Protestant  architecture.  In  keeping  with  the  special  features 
of  Protestant  worship,  he  created  a  central  structure  in 
which  the  altar,  pulpit,  baptismal  font,  and  organ  were  all 
located  in  full  view  of  the  congregation  beneath  the  bell¬ 
shaped  stone  dome.  Shown  here  is  the  original  drawing 
with  handwritten  approval  (dated  26  June  1726)  by  Count 
August  Christoph  von  Wackerbarth,  superintendent  of 
Saxon  architecture.  Construction  was  begun  two  months 
later.  The  church  was  dedicated  in  1734,  but  the  last 
stone  was  not  laid  until  1743.

Dresden,  1843. 

Richard  Wagner,  Hofkapellmeister  in  Dresden  from  1842 
until  his  flight  in  1849,  wrote  this  unique  work  as  a 


“stereophonic”  dialogue  among  several  choir  groups, 
followed  by  the  entrance  of  full  orchestra.  It  had  its 
premiere  under  his  direction  at  the  Dresden  Frauenkirche 
on  6  July  1843.  Twelve  hundred  Saxon  singers  are  said 
to  have  participated  in  the  choirs,  and  the  premiere  was 
an  extraordinary  success.

Dresden,  the  capital  of  Albertinian  Saxony  since  1485, 
was  expanded  into  a  fortress  in  the  sixteenth  century.  It  was 
protected  by  the  citizenry  until  1587,  when  a  regular 


garrison  was  established.  Elector  Johann  Georg  III  (1647-91) 
created  a  standing  army  in  1682,  and  the  office  of  comman¬ 
dant  was  created  for  Dresden  in  1692.  One  of  the  duties  of 
the  commandant  and  his  adjutants  was  opening  and  closing 
three  city  gates  and  lowering  and  raising  the  drawbridges.

At  the  beginning  of  the  nineteenth  century  the  Dresden

his  city  from  a  particularly  attractive  perspective.  From 
the  confluence  of  the  Weisseritz  and  Elbe  Rivers,  he  had 
a  view  of  both  parts  of  the  city:  to  the  left,  the  Japanese 
Palace  (home  of  the  Dresden  Court  Library  since  1786), 


the  Neustadt  (New  Town),  and  the  Elbe  River  bridge 
(above  it  the  gardens  and  buildings  of  the  Briihlian  terrace 
and  below,  the  bell  tower  of  the  Frauenkirche);  to  the

This  was  the  first  publication  of  Johann  Joachim 
Winckelmann  (1717-68),  a  mere  forty-page  brochure,  of 
which  fifty  copies  were  printed.  As  a  result,  the  author 


became  famous  overnight  in  the  intellectual  and  artistic 
world.  Winckelmann  founded  the  science  of  archaeology 
and  the  modern  study  of  art  with  this  work  and  his  1764 
Dresden  publication,  Geschichte  der  Kunst  des  Altertums. 
Pivotal  to  his  insights  was  his  study  of  archaeological 
literature  and  of  the  ancient  sculpture  in  the  Dresden  art

Goethe,  Johann  Wolfgang  von:  Letter  to  Johann 
Gottlob  von  Quandt.  Weimar,  9  June  1831. 

In  the  course  of  his  life,  Johann  Wolfgang  von  Goethe 
(1749-1832)  stayed  several  times  in  Dresden.  As  a  student 
at  Leipzig,  he  visited  the  city  in  March  1768,  recalling 
decades  later  in  his  Dichtung  und  Wahrheit  the  deep  impres¬ 
sion  the  Art  Gallery  had  made  on  him.  On  a  journey  to 
Silesia,  he  visited  the  Electoral  Library  on  30  July  1790, 
as  can  be  seen  from  his  entry  in  the  guest  book,  which 


is  still  in  existence.  Besides  other  visits  in  1794,  1810,  and 
1813,  Goethe  maintained  a  host  of  written  contacts, 
officially  with  the  court  and  privately  with  the  intellectual 
elite  of  Dresden.  In  the  letter  of  9  June  1831,  the  poet 
writes  to  the  renowned  art  scholar  and  collector,  Johann 
Gottlob  von  Quandt  (1787-1859),  informing  him  of 
a  shipment  of  paintings  by  Weimar  artists  to  Dresden.

Pitcairnia  (Bromeliaceae). 

The  Saxon  State  Library  owns  a  unique  compendium  in 
nine  folio  volumes,  each  with  roughly  one  hundred  original 
pictures,  of  the  native  and  foreign  plants  raised  in  the 
gardens  and  greenhouses  of  Pillnitz  Castle,  the  summer 
residence  of  the  Saxon  rulers,  around  1800.  This  extraordi¬ 
nary  compilation  was  proposed  and  financed  by  Elector 


Friedrich  August  III  (1750-1827),  who  was  himself  an 
amateur  botanist.  Desiring  that  the  plants  be  depicted 
faithfully,  in  a  manner  both  scientifically  accurate  and  artis¬ 
tically  appealing,  he  appointed  as  “botanical  court  painters” 
artists  who  were  already  recognized  as  talented  plant 
painters,  finding  them  among  the  graduates  of  his  own 
Dresden  Academy  of  Art.  The  final  volume  was  completed 
in  1839,  under  King  Friedrich  August  II,  to  the  same  high 
standards  established  in  1785  with  volume  1.

Family  Album  of  Johann  Gottlieb  Schwender.  1795-1810. 

View  from  the  Elbe  Bridge  toward  the  eastern 
part  of  the  city. 

Family  albums  (Stammbucher)  provide  remarkable  insights 
into  the  emotional  lives  of  our  ancestors.  Known  since  the 
sixteenth  century  and  originally  popular  primarily  among 
the  nobility,  intellectuals,  and  students,  these  books  evolved 
in  the  late  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries  into  the 
“monuments  to  friendship”  common  in  all  social  classes. 


Between  friends  and  acquaintances  it  was  common  to  ask 
for,  and  have  entered  into  these  books,  thoughtful  sayings, 
often  in  combination  with  paintings,  drawings,  and  even 
embroidery,  since  women  also  eagerly  participated  in  this 
custom.  The  specimen  on  display,  from  around  1800, 
belonged  to  a  Dresden  construction  official.  His  friends 
and  acquaintances  were  in  large  part  architects  and  artists. 
For  this  reason,  some  of  the  drawings  are  of  high  quality, 
such  as  the  view  from  the  Elbe  Bridge.

Since  the  Middle  Ages,  mining  had  been  the  major  basis

for  coinage,  from  the  twelfth  century  on.  Later  tin,  copper, 
iron,  coal,  cobalt,  alum,  and  small  amounts  of  gold 


were  mined  as  well.  G.  E.  Rost  documented  the  various 
aspects  of  the  miner’s  life,  his  rich  festive  dress,  his 
work  clothes,  his  workplace,  and  his  tools,  in  a  book 
containing  plates  of  considerable  significance  to 
students  of  cultural  history.

Second  part  of  the  song  in  manuscript,  first  draft. 

Robert  and  Clara  Schumann  lived  in  Dresden  from  1844 
to  1850.  Robert,  however,  could  not  find  a  permanent 
position  in  the  city,  where  he  directed  a  choir.  Clara, 
despite  the  birth  of  several  children  during  this  period, 
provided  for  the  family  by  giving  concerts.  Nevertheless, 
the  couple  found  ample  intellectual  and  artistic  inspiration, 
as  is  shown  by  the  number  of  important  compositions 


that  Robert  Schumann  created  in  Dresden.  The  leaf  on 
display  is  not  only  a  testimony  to  Schumann’s  Dresden 
creativity  but  also  a  historical  document.  At  the  bottom 
of  the  page  the  composer  noted:  “interrupted  by  the  alarm 
bells  on  May  3,  1849.”  On  this  day  there  began  a  revolt 
of  citizens,  after  the  failure  of  which  Richard  Wagner,  along 
with  the  great  architect  Gottfried  Semper  and  other 
notable  figures,  deserted  Dresden.

(To  a  Violet.  Lyrics  by  Ludwig  Holty.  Song  for  Voice

Manuscript,  final  copy. 

On  13  June  1845,  soon  after  the  birth  of  their  third  daughter 
on  11  March,  Robert  and  Clara  Schumann  began  an  album 
in  Dresden  “to  our  chddren  for  faithful  safekeeping. 

It  held  memorabilia  (locks  of  hair,  drawings,  dried  flowers, 
poems,  compositions,  letters)  from  their  closest  friends  and 
relatives.  Later,  particularly  after  Roberts  death,  Clara 


added  autograph  music  by  important  composers  whom  she 
had  never  met,  including  a  draft  leaf  by  Beethoven.  A  late 
addition  to  the  album  is  the  autograph  score  by  Johannes 
Brahms,  who  as  a  youth  of  twenty  was  taken  into  the  inner 
circle  of  the  family  and  enthusiastically  encouraged  in  com¬ 
posing  by  Robert.  According  to  Clara’s  notation  in  the 
upper  righthand  corner  of  page  1,  Brahms  presented  her  the 
final  copy  of  his  1868  song  (Opus  49.2),  on  ornamental 
paper,  on  13  September  1872,  her  birthday.  It  was  unsigned, 
so  Clara  later  added  his  name  as  well  (at  the  end  of  the 
manuscript,  on  page  4).  In  1934  the  Saxon  State  Library 
acquired  this  Dresden  album  from  Schumann’s  grandsons.

In  1831,  when  Leipzig  orientalist  Heinrich  Fleischer  pub¬ 
lished  his  catalog  of  oriental  manuscripts  in  the  Royal 
Public  Library,  he  included  a  falnameh,  a  Persian  book 
of  prophesies.  Such  books  were  used  to  predict  the  future, 
for  example,  the  course  of  a  journey  or  the  success  of  a 


business  deal.  It  is  not  known  how  this  precious  manuscript 
came  into  the  possession  of  the  library;  a  note  in  it  indi¬ 
cates  that  the  manuscript  came  to  Vienna  around  1700 
during  the  Turkish  wars.  The  varying  styles  of  painting, 
artistic  quality,  format,  and  design  of  the  text  suggest  that 
the  manuscript  was  compiled  from  leaves  of  various 
origin,  probably  based  in  part  on  Persian  models  in  Turkey. 
It  can  be  dated  to  the  second  half  of  the  sixteenth  century.

The  Saxon  State  Library,  which  was  established 
by  Prince  Elector  August  of  Saxony  in  1556, 
was  for  hundreds  of  years  the  leading  library 
for  the  humanities  and  social  sciences  in 
German-speaking  Europe.  As  Saxony — and 
with  it  the  city  of  Dresden — was  incorporated 
into  the  Soviet  bloc  in  1945,  the  collections 
of  the  Saxon  State  Library  became  inaccessible 
to  two  generations.  On  the  occasion  of 
the  four  hundred  fortieth  anniversary  of  the 
founding  of  the  Saxon  State  Library, 
the  Library  of  Congress  is  pleased  to  join  in 
presenting  a  selection  of  treasures  from  Dresden, 
focusing  on  Saxony’s  rich  historical  record 
and  valuable  literary  heritage.  This  beautifully 
illustrated  book  is  a  companion  to  this 
remarkable  exhibition  and  focuses  on 
a  full  range  of  manuscripts,  incunabula,  books, 
music  manuscripts,  photographs,  maps, 
and  paintings  from  the  collections  of  the  Saxon 
State  Library,  most  of  which  have  never  been 
exhibited  outside  of  Germany.
