and/or  with  any  other  land,  lease,  or  leases,  as  to  any  or  ah  minerals  or  horizons,  so  as  to  establish  units  containing  not  more  than  80  surface  acres, 
plus  10%  acreage  tolerance;  provided,  however,  units  may  be  established  as  to  any  one  or  more  horizons,  or  existing  units  may  be  enlarged  as  to 
any  one  or  more  horizons,  so  as  to  contain  not  more  than  640  surface  acres  plus  1 0%  acreage  tolerance,  If  limited  to  one  or  more  of  the  foltowing.

time  established,  or  after  enlargement  are  permitted  or  required  under  any  wwemrnerSal  rule  or  order,  for  the  driing  or  operation  of  a  well  at  a 
regular  location,  or  for  obtaining  maximum  allowable  from  any  wel  to  be  drilled,  dnlling.  or  already  drilled,  any  such  unit  may  be  established  or 
enlarged  to  conform  to  the  size  permitted  or  required  by  such  governmental  order  or  rule.  Lessee  shall  exercise  said  cotton  as  to  each  desired  unit 
by  executing  an  instrument  kterrtifying  such  uni  and  filing  it  for  record  in  the  public  office  in  which  this  lease  is  recorded.  Such  unit  shall  become 
effective  as  of  the  date  provided  for  in  said  instrument  or  instruments  but  if  said  instrument  or  instruments  make  no  such  provision,  then  such  unit 
shall  become  effective  on  the  date  such  instrument  or  instruments  are  so  filed  of  record.  Each  of  said  options  may  be  exercised  by  Lessee  at  any 
time  and  from  time  to  time  while  this  tease  is  in  force,  and  whether  before  or  after  operations  or  production  has  been  established  either  on  said 
land,  or  on  the  rjorbon  of  said  land  included  in  the  unit,  or  on  other  land  unitized  therewith.  A  unit  established  hereunder  shal  be  valid  and  effective 
for  an  purposes  of  this  lease  even  though  there  may  be  mineral,  royalty,  or  leasehold  interests  in  tends  within  the  unit  which  are  not  effectively 
pooled  or  unitized.  Any  operations  conducted  on  any  part  of  such  unitized  tend  shall  be  considered,  for  all  purposes,  except  the  rjayment  of 
royalty,  operations  conducted  upon  said  land  under  this  tease.  There  shal  be  allocated  to  the  tend  covered  by  this  (ease  within  each  such  unit  (or 
to  each  separate  tract  within  the  unit  if  this  lease  covers  separate  tracts  within  the  unit)  that  proportion  of  the  total  production  of  unitized 
minerals  from  the  unit  after  deducting  any  used  in  lease  or  unit  operations,  which  the  number  of  surface  acres  in  such  land  for  in  each  such 
separate  tract)  covered  by  this  tease  wrthin  the  unit  bears  to  the  total  number  of  surface  acres  in  the  unit,  and  the  production  so  alocated  shall  be 
considered  for  al  purposes,  including  payment  or  delivery  of  royalty,  overriding  royalty  and  any  other  payments  out  of  production,  to  be  the  entire 
production  of  unitized  minerals  from  the  tend  to  which  allocated  in  the  same  manner  as  though  produced  therefrom  under  the  terms  of  this  tease. 
The  owner  of  the  reversionary  estate  of  any  term  royalty  or  mineral  estate  agrees  that  the  accrual  of  royalties  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  or  of 
shut-in  royalties  from  a  wed  on  the  unit  shad  satisfy  any  limitation  of  term  requiring  production  of  oi  or  gas.  The  formation  of  any  unit  nereunder 
which  includes  land  not  covered  by  this  tease  shall  not  have  the  effect  of  excriangirig  or  transferring  any  interest  under  this  tease  (including,  without 
limitation,  any  shut-in  royalty  which  may  become  payable  under  this  tease)  between  parties  owning  interests  in  land  covered  by  this  tease  and 
parties  owning  interests  in  land  not  covered  by  this  lease.  Neither  shall  it  impair  the  right  of  Lessee  to  release  as  provided  in  paragraph  5  hereof, 
except  that  Lessee  may  not  so  release  as  to  lands  within  a  unit  while  there  are  operations  thereon  for  unitized  minerals  unless  all  pooled  leases 
are  released  as  to  lands  within  the  unit.  At  any  time  while  this  lease  is  in  force  Lessee  may  dissolve  any  unit  establshed  hereunder  by  filing  for 
record  in  the  public  office  where  this  lease  is  recorded  a  declaration  to  that  effect,  if  at  that  time  there  is  no  unitized  minerals  being  produced  from 
such  unit.  Any  unit  formed  may  be  amended,  re-formed,  reduced  or  enlarged  by  Lessee  at  its  election  at  any  time  and  from  time  to  time  after  the 
original  forming  thereof  by  filing  an  appropriate  instrument  of  record  in  the  pubic  office  in  which  the  pooled  acreage  is  located.  Subject  to  the 

S revisions  of  this  paragraph  4,  a  unit  once  established  hereunder  shall  remain  in  force  so  long  as  any  lease  subject  thereto  shaB  remain  in  force.  If 
lis  lease  now  or  hereafter  covers  separate  tracts,  no  pooling  or  unitization  of  royalty  interests  as  between  any  such  separate  tracts  is  intended 
or  shall  be  implied  or  result  merely  from  the  inclusion  of  such  separate  tracts  within  this  lease  but  Lessee  shal  nevertheless  have  the  right  to
