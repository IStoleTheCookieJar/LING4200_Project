EXPLANATORY NOTES 


INTRODUCTION 1 This publication contains estimates from the quarterly Survey of Employment 
and Earnings (SEE) which was introduced in the September quarter 1983. The 
survey is designed to obtain, from employer units, information on numbers of wage 
and salary earners employed each month and their quarterly earnings. It replaced 
the civilian employees series, based principally on information obtained from 
payroll tax returns, which was discontinued after April 1980. 


SCOPE 2 All wage and salary earners who received pay in any pay period ending within the 
quarter were represented in the survey, except: 


* members of the Australian permanent defence forces; 


" employees of businesses in the private sector primarily engaged in 
Agriculture, forestry and fishing; 


* employees in private households employing staff; 
* employees of overseas embassies, consulates, etc.; 
* employees based outside Australia; and 


*" employees on workers’ compensation who are not paid through the payroll. 


3 An indicator of the number of wage and salary earners out of scope as at June 
1998 is shown in the following list: 


New South Wales 70,101 
Victoria 43,907 
Queensland 55,244 
South Australia 26,266 
Western Australia 24,882 
Tasmania 8,667 
Northern Territory 7,595 
Australian Capital Territory 8,809 
Australia 245,470 


4 Estimates of the number of employees in private sector Agriculture, forestry and 
fishing and Private households employing staff were derived from the Labour Force 
Survey (LFS). Data relating to the number of permanent defence force members 
are based upon information supplied to the ABS by the Department of Defence. 


5 Also excluded are the following persons who are not regarded as employees for 
the purposes of this survey: 


" directors who are not paid a salary; 
" proprietors/partners of unincorporated businesses; and 


* self-employed persons such as subcontractors, owner/drivers, consultants and 


persons paid solely by commission without a retainer. 


SURVEY METHODOLOGY 6 Asample of approximately 10,000 employer units is selected from the ABS 

AND DESIGN Business Register to ensure adequate State and industry representation. Of these, 
approximately 7,500 are in the private sector and 2,500 are in the public sector. 
The survey is conducted by mail each quarter. However, data for a number of 
Commonwealth, Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory government 
departments are collected electronically. 


7 The statistical unit for the survey comprises all activities of an employer in a 
particular State or Territory. Each statistical unit is classified to an industry which 
reflects the predominant activity of the business in the State or Territory. See 
paragraphs 10-13 for more information on classification by industry.

EXPLANATORY NOTES continued 


SURVEY METHODOLOGY 8 Information on monthly number of employees and quarterly earnings is 

AND DESIGN continued collected each quarter. For the first and last month of each quarter, only the total 
number of employees is collected; for the mid-month of each quarter, the number 
of full-time and part-time employees are collected. Up until May 1996 the number 
of male and female employees was also collected. 


9 Public sector statistical units are stratified by State, industry and number of 
employees. Private sector units are further stratified by institutional sector 
classification. An equal probability sample is selected from each stratum. 


SURVEY DESIGN CHANGES 10 From the March quarter 1997, the industrial classification used in the sample 
design of the SEE is the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial 
Classification; for more details refer to Australian and New Zealand Standard 
Industrial Classification (ANZSIC), 1993 (Cat. no. 1292.0). It replaced the 
Australian Standard Industrial Classification (ASIC) previously used. 


11 A consequence of the introduction of ANZSIC is that in the March quarter 1997 
there is a higher than normal proportion of newly selected units in the sample 
causing higher than normal standard errors on estimated December quarter 1996 to 
March quarter 1997 movements. Hence caution should be used when comparing 
movements between these two quarters with movements between previous and 
subsequent quarters. 


12 For further information see paragraphs 10-15 of the Explanatory Notes in the 
March quarter 1997 issue of this publication. 


HISTORICAL ANZSIC 13 Previously published ASIC industry estimates have been recompiled on an 

ESTIMATES equivalent ANZSIC basis back to the September quarter 1983. The historical 
ANZSIC estimates to September 1994 were produced by developing a concordance 
between ASIC and ANZSIC. The ANZSIC estimates from the December quarter 
1994 to the December quarter 1996 have been produced by recoding survey unit 
data from ASIC to ANZSIC. Due to the sample being designed on an ASIC basis 
from the September quarter 1983 to the December quarter 1996, ANZSIC estimates 
for this period are subject to higher than normal standard errors. 


STANDARD INSTITUTIONAL 14 Institutional units are classified by broad economic functions according to the 

SECTOR CLASSIFICATION Standard Institutional Sector Classification of Australia which is a key component of 
the general national accounting framework; for more details refer to Standard 
Institutional Sector Classification of Australia (SISCA), 1987 (Cat. no. 1218.0). 
Public sector data split by the SISCA classification are available on request. 


EMPLOYER SIZE CLASSIFICATION 15 Data presented in table 20 show the distribution of employees in employer 
units over three size ranges. Over time, the composition of these categories will 
vary as some employer units migrate from one size group to another due to 
changes in the number of their employees.

EXPLANATORY NOTES continued 


16 Estimates are subject to sampling and non-sampling errors. For more 
information refer to the Technical Notes. 


17 Adjustments are included in the estimates to allow for lags in processing new 
businesses to the ABS Business Register and the omission of some mainly small 
private sector businesses from the Business Register. These adjustments were 
introduced in the March quarter 1997 issue and were backcast to the introduction 
of the series in 1983. For more details refer to the March quarter 1997 issue or the 
Information Paper: Improvements to ABS Economic Statistics, 1997 

(Cat. no. 1357.0). 


18 Estimates of wage and salary earners are presented in this publication for the 
middle month of the quarter. Monthly data are available on request. The survey is 
conducted quarterly and the sample of employer units is updated each quarter to 
reflect changes in the Register, from which the sample is selected. These changes 
arise from the emergence of new businesses, takeovers and mergers, changes to 
industry classification, changes in the number of employees, and businesses which 
have ceased operations. 


19 Estimates of movements are also affected by: 


"changes in the reported number of employees of selected businesses ; 
* the controlled rotation of the sample; and 


"the privatisation of public trading and public financial enterprises. 


20 Seasonal adjustment is a means of removing the estimated effects of normal 
seasonal variation from the series so that the effects of other influences on the 
series can be more clearly recognised. Seasonal adjustment does not aim to 
remove the irregular or non-seasonal influences which may be present in any 
particular month. Influences that are volatile or unsystematic can still make it 
difficult to interpret the movement of the series even after adjustment for seasonal 
variation. This means that quarter-to-quarter movements of seasonally adjusted 
estimates may not be reliable indicators of trend behaviour. 


21 The seasonal factors are reviewed annually to take account of each additional 
year’s original data. The most recent review took place in time for inclusion in the 
March quarter 1998 estimates. 


22 Details about the method of seasonal adjustment of these series are available 


on request.

TREND ESTIMATES 


COMPARABILITY OF RESULTS WITH 
THE LABOUR FORCE SURVEY 


EXPLANATORY NOTES continued 


23 The ABS considers that trend estimates provide a more reliable guide to the 
underlying direction of the data, and are more suitable than either the seasonally 
adjusted or original estimates for most business decisions and policy advice. 


24 The trend estimates in this publication, obtained by dampening out the 
irregular component from the seasonally adjusted series, are calculated using a 
centred 13-term Henderson moving average of the seasonally adjusted series. 
Estimates for the six most recent months cannot be calculated using this centred 
average method; instead an asymmetric average is used. This can lead to revisions 
in the trend estimates for the last six months when data become available for later 
months. Revisions of trend estimates will also occur with revisions to the original 


data and re-estimation of seasonal adjustment factors. 


25 Ifaseries is highly volatile then the trend estimates will be subject to greater 
revision for the latest few months as data become available. However, it is 
important to note that this does not make the trend series inferior to the seasonally 
adjusted or original series. In some cases the effect of the irregular component on 
overall movements will remain in the seasonally adjusted and the original estimates 


but not in the trend series. 


26 For information about ABS procedures for deriving trend estimates and analysis 
of advantages of using them over alternative techniques for monitoring trends, refer 
to Information Paper: A Guide to Interpreting Time Series—Monitoring Trends, 
an Overview (Cat. no. 1348.0), or contact the Assistant Director, Time Series 
Analysis on Canberra (02) 6252 6345. 


27 Two feature articles which have appeared in the ABS monthly publication 
Australian Economic Indicators (Cat. no. 1350.0) may also be of interest: 


" Picking Turning Points in the Economy (April 1991); and 
" Smarter Data Use (March 1992). 


28 The monthly LFS collects data by interview from a sample of about 30,000 
private and non-private dwellings, using trained interviewers. Self-employed 
persons are included in the LFS. The estimates are published in Labour Force, 
Australia, Preliminary (Cat. no. 6202.0) and Labour Force, Australia 

(Cat. no 6203.0). There are conceptual and methodological reasons for differences 
in the estimates produced by the two surveys. These are discussed in Information 
Paper: Comparison of Employment Estimates from the Labour Force Survey and 
the Survey of Employment and Earnings (Cat. no. 6263.0). 


29 When making comparisons of the wage and salary earners components of the 
two surveys it must be borne in mind that the SEE draws its sample from the ABS 
Register while the LFS is a household survey. As discussed in paragraph 17 above, 
the Register is subject to some undercoverage of business units at any point in time. 
This can lead to undercoverage of samples of businesses selected from the Register. 
Estimates obtained from households are not similarly impacted. 


30 Separate estimates of full-time and part-time employees are included in 

table 10. For definitions of these terms, see the Glossary. This table was first 
published in the June quarter 1987 issue of this publication. Information for 
previous quarters back to the September quarter 1983 is available on request. For 
the reasons outlined above in paragraph 29, it is difficult to compare estimates of 
full-time and part-time employees derived from the SEE with those produced from 
the LFS. In the LFS, a person who works more than 35 hours a week in total in two 
(or more) part-time jobs is classified as working full-time. However, in this 
situation, the SEE would show two part-time jobs as having been filled.

COMPARABILITY OF RESULTS WITH THE 31 The ABS considers that the Labour Force series provides the better indicator of 

LABOUR FORCE SURVEY continued — overall employment movements at the Australian and State levels. The aggregate 
employment estimates in the quarterly National Accounts are based on that source. 
The SEE is the preferred source for industry and sector estimates of employees. 


COMPARABILITY OF RESULTS WITH 32 The SEE collects total quarterly employee earnings primarily for use in 
THE SURVEY OF AVERAGE WEEKLY estimating the gross domestic product component of the Australian National 
EARNINGS Accounts. While average employee earnings can be derived from these data, the 


results will not be comparable with those from the Survey of Average Weekly 
Earnings (AWE) published in Average Weekly Earnings, Australia, Preliminary 
(Cat. no. 6301.0) and Average Weekly Earnings, States and Australia 

(Cat. no. 6302.0). The SEE collects the sum of employee earnings for all pay 
periods ending in a quarter and the results will be affected by the varying number of 
pay periods from quarter to quarter, whereas the AWE relates to a specified pay 
period within a quarter and is not subject to such influences. In addition, certain 
types of payments within the scope of the SEE, such as retrospective pay, pay in 
advance, leave loadings and severance, termination and redundancy payments are 
specifically excluded from the AWE. The SEE earnings data are also subject to 
seasonal variations, particularly in the December and March quarters, due to the 
incidence of holidays taken in January being paid in advance and the earnings being 
reported in the December quarter figures.

TECHNICAL NOTES 


RELIABILITY OF ESTIMATES 1 As the estimates in this publication are based on information relating to a 
sample of employers rather than a full enumeration, they are subject to sampling 
variability. That is, they may differ from the estimates that would have been 
produced if the information had been obtained from all employers. This 
difference, called sampling error, should not be confused with inaccuracy that 
may occur because of imperfections in reporting by respondents or in processing 
by the ABS. Such inaccuracy is referred to as non-sampling error and may occur 
in any enumeration whether it be a full count or a sample. Efforts have been made 
to reduce non-sampling error by careful design of questionnaires, detailed 
checking of returns and quality control of processing. 


2 The sampling error associated with any estimate can be estimated from the 
sample results. One measure of sampling error is given by the standard error 
which indicates the degree to which an estimate may vary from the value that 
would have been obtained from a full enumeration (the ‘true’ figure). There are 
about two chances in three that a sample estimate differs from the true value by 
less than one standard error, and about nineteen chances in twenty that the 
difference will be less than two standard errors. 


3 Ifthe standard error of an estimate is large relative to the size of the estimate, 
the usefulness of that estimate is seriously impaired. For the tables in this 
publication, estimates with standard errors greater than 25% of the estimate have 
been labelled with an asterisk. 


4 Standard errors of estimates of level, by industry and States and Territories, are 
shown in table A for the private sector and table B for the public sector and relate 
only to the middle month of the quarter. As the survey is conducted quarterly 
from a common sample of employer units, who report details of employees for 
each month of the quarter, standard errors on all estimates for employees in each 


month are of a similar magnitude. 


5 Standard errors of estimates of movements provide a measure of the reliability 
of changes in the level of an estimate. Tables A and B show standard errors of 
movements in the level of estimates of employees for the private and public 
sectors respectively between the middle months of the most recent two quarters. 


6 An example of the use of standard error on levels is as follows. If the estimated 
number of wage and salary earners was 5,800,000 with a standard error of 34,000, 
then there would be about two chances in three that a full enumeration would 
have given a figure in the range 5,766,000 to 5,834,000 and about nineteen 
chances in twenty that it would be in the range 5,732,000 to 5,868,000. 


7 An example of the use of standard error on movements is as follows. If the 
estimated standard error for a quarterly change estimate of wage and salary 
earners was 15,000 and the quarterly change estimate between two quarters was 
40,000 persons, then there would be about two chances in three that a full 
enumeration would have given a quarterly change estimate in the range 25,000 to 
55,000 persons and about nineteen chances in twenty that it would been in the 
range 10,000 to 70,000 persons. 


8 Quarterly movements in estimates of wage and salary earners are considered to 
be statistically significant where they exceed two standard errors. 


9 Standard errors for earnings are approximately the same relative size as 
standard errors for the number of employees. Detailed standard errors are 
available on request.

Employer size 


Employer units 


Full-time employees 


General government 
enterprises 


Gross earnings 


Industry 


Institutional sector 


Local government employees 


Employees of all departments, agencies and authorities created by or reporting to 
the Commonwealth Parliament. Those bodies run jointly by the Commonwealth 


Government and State Governments are classified to Commonwealth. 


To derive estimates of employer size, each of the approximately 7,500 private 
sector employer units is allocated a size classification based on the number of 
employees actually reported for the middle month of the quarter. The size 
classification reflects the size of a business in each State or Territory and not 
necessarily the size of a business Australia wide. 


Employer units are the statistical units which make up the population from which 
the sample was drawn (see paragraph 7 of the Explanatory Notes). 


Permanent, temporary and casual employees who normally work the agreed or 
award hours for a full-time employee in their occupation and who received pay for 
any part of the reference period. If agreed or award hours do not apply, 
employees are regarded as full-time if they ordinarily work 35 hours or more per 
week. 


Public sector enterprises mainly engaged in the production of goods and services, 
outside the normal market mechanisms, providing these goods and services to the 
general public. The cost of operations is often financed from public revenues (e.g. 


government departments). 


Payments to employees before tax and other items (such as superannuation) are 
deducted. They comprise amounts paid from interstate or overseas; ordinary time 
and overtime earnings; overaward payments; penalty payments, shift and other 
remunerative allowances; commissions and retainers; bonuses and similar 
payments; payments under incentive or piecework; payments under profit-sharing 
schemes; leave loadings; annual and long service leave payments; sick leave 
payments; advance and retrospective payments; salaries and fees paid to company 
directors, members of boards, committees, commissions, councils, etc.; amounts 
paid to employees on workers’ compensation who continue to be paid through 
the payroll; and severance, termination and redundancy payments. 


Industry is classified according to the Australian and New Zealand Standard 
Industrial Classification (see paragraphs 10-12 of the Explanatory Notes). 


Institutional sector is classified according to the Standard Institutional Sector 
Classification of Australia (see paragraph 14 of the Explanatory Notes). 


Employees of municipalities and shires and other local authorities created by or 
subject to the provisions of local government legislation, such as county councils 
in New South Wales.

are included. Part-time and casual employees who may have received pay for only 
a few hours during the reference period are included. Employees on paid leave 
and those employees on workers’ compensation who continue to be paid through 
the employer’s payroll are also included. Casual employees who work on an 
irregular basis and who were not paid for the relevant pay period, employees on 
leave without pay, on strike or stood down without pay for the whole of the pay 
period are excluded. 


Permanent, temporary and casual employees who are not classified as full-time 
employees as defined. 


Public sector enterprises actively involved in financial market transactions such as 
borrowing and lending. Excluded are those public bodies whose funds flow 
directly to or from general government revenue. 


Administrative employees and all other employees of Commonwealth, State and 
local government businesses and financial undertakings engaged in services and 
activities such as railways, road transport, banks, postal and telecommunications, 
education, radio, television, police, public works, factories, marketing authorities, 
hospitals and welfare institutions. 


Public sector enterprises predominantly engaged in the production of goods and 
services with an intention of maximising profits and financial returns with most 


operating costs being derived from trading activities. 
All pay periods which end within the quarter. 


The last pay period ending on or before the third Friday in each month. 


Public sector includes local government authorities and all government 
departments, agencies and authorities created by, or reporting to, the 
Commonwealth Parliament and State Parliaments. All remaining employees are 
classified as private sector. 


Employees of all State government departments and authorities created by, or 
reporting to, State Parliaments, including organisations for which the 
Commonwealth has assumed financial responsibility. Following self-government, 
the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory administrations have 
been classified to State Governments. Employees of State Governments 
employed interstate are included in the estimates of the State in which they are 
based.
