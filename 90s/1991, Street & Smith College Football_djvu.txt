Letter From the Editor 


As another college football 

season was coming to a conclusion last 
January 1, we started thinking of candidates 
for the regional covers of our 1991 edition. 
Some of the choices were obvious. 

Ty Detmer, for sure. The Heisman Trophy winner, apparently fit 
again following surgery to the shoulder he separated in the Holiday 
Bowl, would be returning for his senior year at Brigham Young. Darian 
Hagan hoped to lead Colorado in its defense of the national champi- 
onship (Associated Press), but his playing status was still question- 
able after the severe knee injury he sustained in the Orange Bowl. 
David Klingler led the nation in total offense, accounted for 55 touch- 
downs, and finished fifth on the Heisman ballot. He remained in 
school for his senior year at Houston, which was optimistic about its 
first season off NCAA probation. Alex Van Pelt passed for over 2,000 
yards for the second time in as many years at Pittsburgh, which 
retains all but one 1990 offensive starter. 

Five other quarterbacks are among our 16 cover subjects. Shawn 
Jones led Georgia Tech to an undefeated season and the UPI national 
title. He shares top billing in the South with fellow junior Shane Mat- 
thews, the Southeastern Conference Player of the Year who estab- 
lished nine records at Florida, and Tennessee senior Andy Kelly, who 
finished second to Matthews in SEC passing and ranks just behind 
Klingler as a pro prospect. Senior Matt Rodgers took lowa to the Rose 
Bowl. Like Van Pelt, he threw for over 2,000 yards for the second year 
in a row and accounted for 24 touchdowns. But the NFL will have to 
wait for UCLA's precocious Tommy Maddox, who led the Pac-10 in 
total offense and passing yardage as a freshman. 

Glyn Milburn led the nation in all-purpose running. After sitting out a 
season following his transfer from the University of Oklahoma, the 
Stanford junior rushed for 729 yards, caught 64 passes for 632 yards, 
and returned 48 kicks for an additional 861 yards. He was joined on 
the all-Pac-10 team by California’s Russell White, who was seventh in 
the country in all-purpose yardage—despite not starting a single 
game. A third junior, Mazio Royster of Southern Cal, is the leading 
returning rusher in the conference. He was only the third Trojan soph- 
omore ever to gain 1,000 yards. 

Tico Duckett is the top returning rusher in the nation. He split tail- 
back duties at Michigan State as a sophomore yet still piled up 1,394 
yards. Robert Smith of Ohio State was nearly as impressive, with 
1,126 yards as a Big Ten freshman. Siran Stacy, after a year on the 
sidelines with an injury, is looking to recapture the form that resulted in 
over 1,000 yards and 17 touchdowns as an Alabama junior. And tight 
end Derek Brown, second in receptions at Notre Dame to Rocket 
Ismail (a certain cover subject had he remained in school), returns for 
his final season at South Bend.,The pro scouts can't wait.

Baseball Business 

™™ Currently there is a phenomenon occur- 
ing at North American sporting events which | 
feel is cheating the fan. | am referring to the 
practice of playing taped popular music dur- 
ing warm-ups and breaks in the action. What 
is the purpose of this? 

The endless playing of songs numbs the 
sports fan’s thoughts, and I'm sure even gets 
noticed by the players. It seems that the fran- 
chises are creating a party atmosphere for no 
reason at all. Bring back the organist and 
leave it at that. 

D.M., Toronto, Ontario 


a a 8 a a 
@mm | just bought the 1991 Baseball edition. 
It's another fine job and | buy no other maga- 
zines to update myself on my favorite sport. 
However, | noticed in the “Class of 1991” arti- 
cle a picture of third baseman Edgar Martinez 
of the Seattle Mariners. The caption above his 
picture said “Tino Martinez,” who is a first- 
base candidate for the M's and one of the 
major players in that particular article. 

Marx Fire, Fircrest, WA 
Our apologies to Edgar Martinez, who was 
misidentified. 


™™_ The ruling to keep Pete Rose from his 
much-deserved place in Hall of Fame history 
was absolutely ludicrous. And combined with 
the timing of now not allowing “banned” play- 
ers in the Hall, it obviously proves that this was 
more of a personal vendetta against Pete 
Rose himself. Gambling is a very serious dis- 
ease, and Pete Rose has paid his dues. If 
Babe Ruth were playing today, he'd be la- 
beled an alcoholic with an eating disorder! 
Charlie Hustle played baseball with an exu- 
berance that is sorely missed in today's 
game. Besides being baseball's all-time hits 
leader, he was a winner everywhere he 
played. Keeping this man from his just dues 
would be the biggest injustice of all. 

Jay ViLLers, Nashville, TN 


Cover Subjects 


™™ Could you please send mea complete list 
of all the covers of your Baseball and College 
Football issues? | really want to know the iden- 
tity of the player on the 1942 Baseball cover, 
and is that a Duke player on the cover of the 
1962 College Football issue? | have enclosed 
a stamped, return-address envelope. 

PHit Saxon JR., Wilmington, DE 
Pitcher Howie Pollet of the St. Louis Cardinals 
appeared on the cover of the 1942 Baseball 
and, yes, that is Jay Wilkinson of Duke Univer- 
sity on the 1962 College Football cover. 


mmm in your 1990 College Football edition | 
read with great interest your response to two 
letters regarding regional covers for your 
magazines. | have been an avid purchaser of 
your magazines since 1967 and request the 
list of all cover subjects for both the baseball 
and college football editions. 

Being a fan of the University of Florida, | was 
disappointed that the 1968 cover of Larry 
Smith and the more recent covers of Kerwin 
Bell and Emmitt Smith did not make the cover 
of your 50th anniversary issue. But the photo 
of Steve Spurrier on page 64 was tremen-

dous. Your book is always super. However, 
your outdid yourselves on the baseball and 
college football anniversary issues. Thanks for 
many years of enjoyment. 

Haro. Hyman, Sunrise, FL 


@mm | have been reading all your magazines 
for years. They are great—keep up the good 
work. | am trying to obtain a list of all your 
various covers, as | have over 400 different 
copies of all your Street & Smith’s books and 
I'm sure | am still missing a few. 

LONNIE TAYLOR, Park Hills, KY 
For a complete list of past cover subjects, 
send a postage-paid return envelope. 


Basketball 


mmm | was really impressed with your College 
and Pro Basketball coverage this year, but | 
feel your magazine would be even better if 
you had a little more high school coverage. 
High school teams are the building blocks; 
when good players and good teams come 
together, it can be very exciting. | realize that it 
is very hard to cover high school sports but 
every little bit helps. 

Bryce CLICKNER, Florissant, MO 


mmm I'm writing to tell you how much | enjoy 
both your Basketball and Baseball annuals. | 
have been buying your Baseball edition for 
the past 17 years. | love your articles, stats, 
and action photos. | have just, in the last two 
years, started getting the Pro Basketball and 
look forward to receiving it for years to come. 
Brian J. Hicks, Cicero, IN 


College Football 

mmm Last summer, as | have for the past 18 
years, | purchased your College Football is- 
sue. Although | enjoyed it, as expected, | was 
disappointed to find that some of the features 
that | have most enjoyed in the past were 
missing. As a graduate of a small college 
(Mansfield), | was sad to see that you eliminat- 
ed your small-college coverage, as well as the 
Statistics from the previous season. Those 
particular features distinguished Street & 
Smith's from other publications. | realize the 
1990 edition was unusual due to the emphasis 
given to your 50th anniversary, but | urge you 
to restore those features. 

Incidentally, | did enjoy your 50-year All- 
America team. | especially wish to express my 
pleasure at your recognition of Alex Karras. | 
only wish that your colleagues in the pro foot- 
ball press would follow your example by vot- 
ing Karras into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
He was a great player who deserves to be 
recognized, despite the year-long gambling 
suspension (after all, Paul Hornung has al- 
ready been inducted). 

GreG Narvip, Newport News, VA 
To accommodate all the historical features in 
the 1990 College Football, we had to eliminate 
some of our regular features. But this year's 
edition includes last season's highlights and 
Statistics as well as more expanded national 
previews of Divisions II and III. 


mmm | have been a regular reader of Street & 
Smith's for about 15 years and must say that 
your coverage of every major sport is pretty 
accurate for talent. However, after reading the 
1990 College Football anniversary issue, | 
was puzzled as to why a great running back 
was left off your Dream Team. 
| am a long-time USC fanatic and | noticed 
that Charles White was not included in your 
list. He not only won a Heisman Trophy, he 
ended his career as USC's all-time leading 
rusher (6,245 yards, including bow! games). 
He also averaged more yards per carry (5.44) 
than O.J. Simpson, Marcus Allen, Mike Gar- 
rett, and Ricky Bell. As of today, Charles White 
is second only to Tony Dorsett (your second- 
team Dream Team) in rushing yards in a col- 
lege career. How could he not be one of your 
top 40 running backs? 
Nevin A. Smith, Fort Worth, TX 


mmm | was deeply disappointed upon my initial 
perusal of the 1990 edition of Street & Smith's 
College Football. As an NFLPA certified 
agent, | depend on your magazine to assist 
me in establishing an early potential client 
base among each year's college seniors. Al- 
though | have many other sources in which to 
assimilate this information, | have always 
looked forward to purchasing your informative 
publication. In the past, your publication has 
covered many teams and conferences that no 
other newsstand periodical would research. 
Almost one half of the 1990 edition was devot- 
ed to the past 50 years, to the exclusion of 
these other deserving teams. 

If | had glanced through your magazine be- 
fore | purchased it, you would have lost a sale 
as well as a loyal reader. | guess Street & 
Smith's is falling into the same inflationary mo- 
dus as other products: you have to pay more 
and you get less. Next year I'll give your mag- 
azine a good look at the newsstand before | 
spend my money. 

Steven M. Lee, Sacramento, CA 


@™m | enjoyed your anniversary issue of Col- 
lege Football. The articles on the various 
teams brought back a lot of memories—both 
pleasant and unpleasant. |'m writing to ask 
this time if Prairie View intends to field a foot- 
ball team this fall. When it dropped football 
just before last season started it said it was for 
a temporary period. | read last month that 
West Texas State has terminated its football 
program. 

Tom Green, Dundee, FL 
After a year’s hiatus, Prairie View will compete 
in the Southwestern Athletic Conference. 


You're Welcome 

mmm | have received the magazines you have 
sent me. | would like to let you know how much 
we appreciate them. It's nice to know all of us 
here in Saudi Arabia are supported back 
home by everyone. Again, my friends and | 

can't thank you enough. 
Gary SEIFRIG, JR., 
Operation Desert Storm,

Heisman 


Trophy 
Winner 


Ty Detmer 


of Brigham Young University won the 
56th Heisman Trophy. He is the first play- 
er from his school—the first from the 
Mountain time zone—and the third 
straight junior to be so honored. But un- 
like the two previous winners, Barry 
Sanders of Oklahoma State and Andre 
Ware of Houston, who renounced their 
final season of eligibility to enter the Na- 
tional Football League, Detmer is return- 
ing for his senior year. Thus he could 
become the first two-time Heisman re- 
cipient since Ohio State’s Archie Griffin 
in 1974-75 

BYU has produced a number of gifted 
quarterbacks, including Gifford Nielsen, 
Jim McMahon, Steve Young, Marc Wil- 
son, and Robbie Bosco, but the 6-0, 175- 
pound Detmer surpassed all of them with 
his accomplishments. As a sophomore, 
he led the nation in passing efficiency. 
Last season, he completed 361 of 562 
attempts for 41 touchdowns and an 
NCAA record 5,188 yards in leading the 
Cougars to a 10-2 mark and a berth in 
the Holiday Bowl 

Raghib Ismail, Notre Dame's electrify-

BUTKUS 
AWARD 


Exemplary 
Player 
of the Ye 


Street & Smith's, in association with the 
Downtown Athletic Club, presented the 
University of Virginia quarterback Shawn 
Moore with its third annual Exemplary College 
Football Player of the Year Award. 

Moore brought the national spotlight to 
shine on Charlottesville. Prior to his arrival, Vir- 
ginia had never played in a New Year's Day 
bowl game and had never placed higher than 
No. 9 in the polls. He directed the Cavaliers to 
23 victories in his last 27 regular-season 
starts, to the Florida Citrus Bowl in 1990 and 
the Sugar Bowl in '91. For three straight weeks 
last fall, Virginia was the top-ranked team in 
the country 

Moore capped a remarkable career by 
leading the nation in passing efficiency a year 
ago, throwing for 2,262 yards and 21 touch- 
downs with just eight interceptions. He broke 
Doug Flutie's NCAA record with an average of 
15.75 yards per completion and averaged 
one touchdown every 11 plays. He was 
named first-team All-America by both the 
Football Writers and the Football Coaches As- 
sociations, the first Atlantic Coast Conference 
quarterback since North Carolina State’s Ro- 
man Gabriel in 1961 to win that honor 

Heaving earned his degree in psychology 
last summer, Moore competed in the fall while 
pursuing graduate studies in counseling edu- 
cation. In addition, he participated in “Hero,” 
acommunity program. “The athletes would go 
into the elementary schools and sit with the 
kids in class,” said Moore. “We'd shoot the 
breeze, take them out for recess, and help 
them with their schoolwork. It's like being a 
role model right there in class.” 

Also honored in conjunction with the 50th 
anniversary of Street & Smith's College Foot- 
ball were Jim Brown, Tommy McDonald, Dar- 
rell Royal, Jim Plunkett, and Randy Vataha.

Great 
Rivalries 


Financial demands 


have led to the 
disappearance of 


some memorable 


and traditional 
games 


by MALCOLM MORAN 


NEW YORK TIMES 


Joe 
Paterno 


Penn State and Pittsburgh will soon be- 

gin a trial separation. Miami and Notre 
Dame announced a semi-amicable divorce. 
Texas and Arkansas will head down different 
paths after an emotional meeting, perhaps for 
the last time in a long time, in Little Rock on 
October 19. Boston College and Holy Cross 
have already split. Fordham and Pittsburgh 
went in different directions decades ago, not 
so long after there was so much ado about 
nothing to nothing. 

As the financial demands of the market- 
place lead colleges to choose new dance 
partners, replacing long associations with 
new conference loyalties, one of the first signs 
of change will be the disappearance of some 
long and memorable rivalries. Football, more 
than any other sport, has thrived as a result of 
the anticipation over the one-time meeting be- 
tween disliked neighbors, adjacent states, or 
championship contenders. It has almost al- 
ways been that way. 

If Keith Jackson and television technology 
had been present when Princeton and 
Rutgers began all this business in 1869, it is 
reasonable to assume he would have pointed 
out, soon after the first big hit, that these were 
two teams that don't like each other. 

When Yale was constructing the model from 
which so much of the game was built, it was 
no coincidence that the Yale Bowl, the giant 
saucer scooped out of Connecticut earth, was 
completed in time for the Harvard game in 
1914. T.A.D. Jones, the Yale coach not long 
after, may have defined the proper attitude for 
such an occasion when he addressed anoth- 
er Yale team with these words: “Gentlemen, 
you are about to play Harvard. Never in your 
life will you do anything so important.” 

For several special hours each season, of- 
ten some time close to Thanksgiving, per- 
spective is flung aside in the pursuit of a terri- 
torial advantage that can last, roughly, the 
next 51 weeks, or of a championship that will 
endure forever. At the end of the 1968 season, 
41 years after T.A.D. Jones's final year at Yale, 


pact rai] 

Army's Doc Blanchard (#35) and 
Glenn Davis (#41) with their coach, 
Red Blaik, in 1946; Clinton Jones 
breaks a tackle in Michigan State's 
victory over Michigan in 1965. 


his words could have been applied to another 
group of Bulldogs. That Yale team, with no 
time left on the scoreboard clock at ancient 
Harvard Stadium, allowed the last fragment of 
a 16-point lead and a perfect season get away 
in the 29-29 “loss” to Harvard that created a 
tie for the lvy championship. 

On those special occasions, when the busi- 
ness of the real world seems to grind to a halt 
temporarily, a sense of perspective may be as 
rare as a hotel room in the college town the 
night before the big game. In 1944, after Doc 
Blanchard and Glenn Davis had each scored 
a touchdown to give Army a 23-7 victory over 
Navy at Baltimore on the way to its first nation- 
al championship, Earl (Red) Blaik, the Army 
coach, received a telegram: 


THE GREATEST OF ALL 
ARMY TEAMS STOP 
WE HAVE STOPPED THE WAR 
TO CELEBRATE YOUR MAGNIFICENT 
SUCCESS STOP MACARTHUR, 


After the end of an Army-Navy game in the 
1960s, during the confusion on the grass field 
at Philadelphia, Bill Belichick, now the coach 
of the Cleveland Browns but then the young 
son of long-time Navy assistant Steve Beli- 
chick, found a piece of paper and stuffed it in 
his pocket. It was not until later that the father 
discovered the significance of what the boy 
had stumbled upon: the plans of an Army 
coach. And it was not until the following sea- 
son that the Army staff knew, when Steve Beli- 
chick casually tossed some Army terminology 
into a conversation with acquaintances on the 
Army staff, and panic set in at West Point. 

Navy does that to Army people, but the 
armed services are not alone. Bear Bryant's 
315th victory in 1981, which passed Amos 
Alonzo Stagg’s total of 314 as the most of any 
major-college coach, was made that much 
more meaningful because it came in the emo- 
tional cauldron of Legion Field in Birmingham, 
over the Auburn Tigers. Two seasons ago, 
when an Alabama team finally had to come to 
Auburn's Jordan-Hare Stadium, the appear- 
ance was interpreted by Auburn fans as a 
long-awaited symbol of equality in what they 
had felt had been an unequal rivalry. And 
when Alabama's undefeated season was 
wrecked, that frenzied December Saturday 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


| the Tiger victory to those he had seen on tele- 


became a perfect moment for Tiger faithful. | 
Bill Curry, then the Alabama coach, solemnly 
placed his team's defeat, and the lost chance 
of a national championship, within the frame- 
work of the future. If today's disappointment 
could help his players deal with some future 
setback, something truly significant, then Cur- 
ry felt that a football game would have some 
worth in the lives of the young people. 

Curry departed quietly, the winning coach 
came in, and Auburn's Pat Dye compared the 
looks on the faces of the Auburn fans before 


vision several weeks before, when the Berlin 
Wall began to tumble down. (East Germany 
vs. West Germany being another rivalry that 
was ended by a revised conference affili- 
ation.) Toomer's Corner would never be the 
same. Late that night, as car horns blared, as 


white toilet paper seemed to grow from trees | 


and people everywhere screamed “War-r-r-r-r 
Eagle,” a group of Auburn students stood on a 


| corner, took in the scene, and suddenly | 
| shouted: “LIVE, FROM AUBURN: IT’S SATUR- 
DAY NIGHT!” 


The problem that followers must face now is 
the realization that more than ever, emotional 
ties bound by decades of tradition have be- 
come far less significant than the laws of com- 
merce and the need to stay in business. The 
danger is that the sense of emotion, which 
separates the colleges from the professionals, 
is being forgotten in conference room discus- 
sions of ratings points and market shares. 

“It's difficult to define what is a traditional 
game,” said Joe Paterno, the Penn State 
coach, whose program will begin to form new 
ties when it begins Big Ten play in 1993. 
“Now, with television, games that have an in- 
tense rivalry become traditional.” 

Paterno began to list the examples of 
games that Penn State fans have eagerly an- 
ticipated. The brief rivalry with Nebraska, 
spiced by controversial calls by officials, is 
over. Alabama is off the Nittany Lion sched- 
ule. Penn State-Notre Dame, a game that has 
become an annual November occasion that 
cost the Fighting Irish a chance for a national 
championship last season, will end soon. 

“To me a big game is when there's some- 
thing at stake,” Paterno said. “Whether it's a 


national championship, whether it’s beating a 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


program that has been on top, like Notre | 


Dame or Southern California. And the Pitt- 
Penn State game has had those implications.” 

If a football team can contribute to the mem- 
ories of a college experience, the big game 
provides some of the sharpest definitions. The 
backdrop can hold bundled masses in the 
east and north or short-sleeved fans in the 
south and west. In an era that defines its mo- 
ments on the front of T-shirts, the occasions 
have ranged from the 1980 "Probation Bow!” 
between USC and UCLA to the recent “Catho- 
lics vs. Convicts,” inspired by the tension be- 
tween Notre Dame and Miami. 

The setting can be as intimate as Bethle- 
hem, PA, where Lafayette and Lehigh will 
meet for the 127th time this season, or as mas- 
sive as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, a 
short walk from the Southern Cal campus, 
where the statue of Tommy Trojan will be care- 
fully wrapped and protected from any hint of 
blue and yellow paint from the UCLA campus 
in Westwood. When the intensity of a rivalry is 
combined with the stakes of a league champi- 
onship, the result can be a moment that de- 


|. fines an era, large or small. 


O.J. Simpson built his total of 3,423 yards 
with dramatic bursts at USC, but none more 
memorable than his 64-yard, fourth-quarter 
touchdown in the 1967 UCLA game, an audi- 
ble—23 blast—that began to the left and de- 
veloped on a diagonal line to the right through 
the Bruin defenders, on the way to a one-point 
victory and an eventual national title. 

For the people in the painted faces, and 


those attached to televisions or radios, the | 


moments live forever: 

A year after World War II, Notre Dame stu- 
dents sent postcards to Red Blaik at West 
Point that were signed SPATNC—Society for 
the Prevention of Army's Third National Cham- 
pionship. A game scheduled for November 9 
at Yankee Stadium was sold out in June. And 
when Doc Blanchard broke into the clear 
in a scoreless game, with only Johnny 
Lujack in a position to make a tackle, a 
packed house in The Bronx waited. Lujack 
made the tackle, and the tie was preserved. 

More than 40 years later, on a perfect South 
Bend Saturday, a game that was once a Notre 
Dame excuse to visit south Florida in Novem- 
ber became a focal point to a season. Helped 
by a controversial decision by the officials, 


| 


Notre Dame beat Miami, 31-30, when Pat Ter- 
rell knocked down Steve Walsh's two-point 
conversion pass in the corner of the end zone 
with 45 seconds to play. 

In 1959, on Halloween night at Tiger Stadi- 
um in Baton Rouge, Billy Cannon returned a 
punt 89 yards to give Louisiana State, the de- 
fending national champion, a 7-3 victory over 
Mississippi. 

In one of the very few games of the century 
to live up to the name, Johnny Rodgers re- 
turned a punt 72 yards for a touchdown, and 
Jeff Kinney scored his fourth touchdown of the 
game with 1:38 to play, to give Nebraska its 
35-31 victory over Oklahoma at Norman on 
Thanksgiving Day in 1971. 

Clemson's game against South Carolina 
was once preserved by the General Assembly 
of South Carolina. Now the Tigers and Game- 
cocks usually face each other in the final 
game of the season. But when the game was 
played on Big Thursday (the third Thursday in 
October as a featured attraction at the state 
fair in Columbia), the stakes were often high 
and the outcomes surprising. In 1950 Clem- 
son entered the game without having allowed 
a point, but came away with a 14-14 tie. 

Meaningful games do not require decades 
of tailgating. In 1973, one year after Cal State 
Fullerton began playing Long Beach State, 
the Titans overcame a 15-year head start to 
defeat the more established Long Beach pro- 
gram, 17-14, 

The business of rivalries has become more 
complex as scholarship limitations have cre- 
ated a national balance among powers. Ne-

braska fans have grown accustomed to late- | 


season confrontations with Oklahoma since 
the Cornhuskers became a factor in the 
1960s, but losses to Colorado in the past two 
seasons have defined Nebraska's seasons. 


Michigan State’s games with Notre Dame | 


have included the controversial 10-10 tie in 
1966, but would anyone in East Lansing trade 
a victory over Notre Dame for one against 
Michigan? Michigan's championship hopes 
last year were ended by a blown call and a 
last-second loss to Michigan State, but the 
Wolverines’ meetings with Ohio State have of- 
ten been more important and the memories 
longer lasting. 
Texas A&M and Houston have often played 
| the same day as Texas and Oklahoma have 
| met in Dallas. Five years after Houston began 
playing a major-college schedule, the Cou- 
gars defeated an A&M team coached by Bry- 
| ant to prevent the Aggies from building a per- 
fect record. But the Aggies have more tradi- 
| tional business waiting at the end of their sea- 
son, when the Texas Longhorns are waiting. 
And while Yale has always pointed to Har- 
vard, Princeton pointed to Yale one week be- 
fore. Princeton had beaten Yale six consecu- 
tive times going into the 1953 game, the sea- 
son that Homer Smith was the Princeton cap- 
tain. Charlie Caldwell, the Princeton coach, 
won 70 of 103 games in his 12 years with the 
Tigers, but the priority was clear. “| played for 
| a coach who believed a team could get up 
only once a season,” Smith remembered. “He 
saved everything for Yale.” 
Emotionally and strategically, the Tigers 
conducted an annual ambush of a Yale team 


standing of the after-effects of a rivalry began 


in his senior season. His fumble led to a Yale 
touchdown, which led to a 26-24 loss at home 
and a memory that remains fresh. 

Itis possible that no one in America has had 
such an intimate view of more rivalries than 
| Homer Smith. He has served on the staff at 
| Stanford, which meets California in The Big 
Game. He was an essential part of the Ala- 
bama offensive scheme when the Crimson 
Tide made their historic, and unsuccessful, 
trip to Auburn. Smith is now at UCLA, which 


presents its sun-splashed meeting with USC | 


in contrast to the snow and cold in State Col- 
lege, PA, and Ann Arbor, and Columbus, and 
Philadelphia, where Army and Navy celebrat- 
ed a 100th anniversary last December. 

Homer Smith also understands about Army 
and Navy, a game that can stop a war and 
cost a coach his job. Smith's Army teams lost 
four of five games to Navy, including a 28-0 
defeat at crumbling, dark Kennedy Stadium in 
1978 that quickly became his last game as 
| coach of the Cadets. 

Of all the rivalries he has witnessed, Smith 
finds the game against USC the most enjoy- 
able. “There is great respect between the two 
schools,” he said. “Fierce rivalry, but not bad, 
not enmity. It's like if somebody attacked Los 


| Angeles, we'd fight side by side.” 


Which is what some of the most intense 
Army and Navy followers did when last year’s 
game was over and real life resumed in the 
Persian Gulf. Smith remembered the feeling of 
respect being a common denominator when

BUFFALO NEWS 


> As 1990 turned toward 1991, the two 
» quarterbacks who made the University of 
Houston's run-and-shoot offense succeed 
greeted the new year with different attitudes. 
David Klingler had made his decision to re- 
turn to school for his senior season in '91. He 
took personal aim at Ty Detmer and the Heis- 
man Trophy, as well as the possibility of being 
the premium pick in the 1992 National Foot- 
ball League draft. Andre Ware, behind whom 
Klingler played in 1989 when Ware won the 
Heisman, faced an uncertain tuture. He had 
left the Cougars with a year’s eligibility re- 
maining to enter the pro draft. The Detroit Li- 
ons selected him in the first round, yet he 
played relatively little. By the end of the sea- 
son, he had become disillusioned. Two differ- 
ent decisions led down two different paths. 
Some of the best college quarterbacks will 
be confronted by similar decisions in the next 
couple of years. Opportunities beckon them in 
the NFL. The question is whether they are pre- 
pared to meet the opportunities. The job mar- 
ket may be tight for graduating teachers,

Employment opportunities 
in the NFL are abundant for

physicists, engineers, and accountants, but 
for the best of the college quarterbacks, em- 
ployment possibilities are abundant. NFL 
teams gobble up quarterback talent. Almost 
40 percent of the league’s 28 teams have the 
“Help Wanted” sign out. Here are some of the 
pros’ neediest teams. 


DIRE NEED 

Kansas City The admirable Steve DeBerg 
will be 38 in January. The Chiefs drafted Mike 
Elkins from Wake Forest in the second round 
two years ago, but he’s so green that the 
Chiefs lent him out to the World League of 
American Football last spring. 

New England The Patriots used three quar- 
terbacks last season. All were found wanting. 
San Diego The Chargers soured on Billy Joe 
Tolliver, then auditioned sixth-round rookie 
John Friesz late last year. 


y, 


Alex Van Pelt Pitt 


Al Kooistra 


SERIOUS NEED 

Seattle Dave Krieg turns 33 during the sea- 
son and coach Chuck Knox has been search- 
ing for his successor for at least three years. 
The Seahawks traded a first-round draft 
choice and two fifths for Kelly Stouffer three 
years ago, but he hasn't done a thing. Dan 
McGwire was drafted in the first round. 

Los Angeles Raiders The Raiders dealt su- 
per tackle Jim Lachey to Washington for Jay 
Schroeder, who has been a major disappoint- 
ment. Steve Beuerlein was kept inactive for a 
large part of 1990. Al Davis drafted young 
Todd Marinovich in the first round, a move his 
NFL peers considered a reach. 

New York Jets New England reject Tony Ea- 
son was imported in late '89 to challenge the 
fading Ken O'Brien for the No. 1 job. Rookie 
Troy Taylor saw limited action a year ago, and 
the strong-armed Browning Nagle was the 
club's top pick in April. 


QUESTIONABLE 

Pittsburgh After five seasons, Bubby Brister 
still plays like a journeyman most of the time. 
Atlanta Jerry Glanville, the new coach, was 
dissatisfied with Chris Miller. Many of the play- 
ers felt the backup, Hugh Millen, should have

been playing last year and Millen, exposed on | 


Plan B, ended up in New England. 

Chicago Mike Tomczak is gone, but Jim 
Harbaugh is just as much a question mark. 
Peter Tom Willis didn't make enough of an 


impression as a rookie to make the Bears | 


comfortable about the future. 

Minnesota After 10 seasons, Wade Wilson is 
still a marginal player. Rich Gannon isn’t much 
more than a curiosity. 

Green Bay \f Don Majkowski comes back 
from shoulder surgery, take the Pack off the 
questionable list. But the injury was to his rota- 
ty cuff—serious stuff. Anthony Dilweg might 
get them through a game or two, but that's it. 
Tomczak was signed as a free agent after the 
Bears cast him off. 


Part of the “help wanted” story is due to the 
mediocrity in the quarterback classes from 
the last three college seasons. Of the 20 quar- 
terbacks drafted in the first six rounds in the 
last three years, only two—Troy Aikman and 
Jeff George—had an immediate impact. The 
pros yearn for something like the class of '83, 
when four eventual Super Bowl quarter- 


backs—John Elway, Dan Marino, Jim Kelly, | 


and Eason—came out of college, or the 1973 
class, when Bert Jones was drafted in the first 
round, Ron Jaworski in the second, Dan Fouts 


and Joe Ferguson in the third, and the useful | 


Don Strock in the fifth.

Is it any surprise that NFL ears perk up | 
when Bobby Bowden, the respected Florida 
State coach, referred to his senior quarter- 
back, Casey Weldon, as “a young Joe Mon- 
tana?” Marinovich analyzed the quarterback 
drought of the last three years and decided 


| that he should chuck his last two years of col- 


lege eligibility and enter the NFL draft. What 
Marinovich does in the next couple of seasons 
will be watched closely by everyone connect- 
ed with college and pro football. Most footbal 
people, including the majority of pro scouts, 
think Marinovich made a major mistake by not 
staying in school. 

“Marinovich isn't ready,” said a top person- 
nel director from the west coast, who request- 
ed anonymity. “He has some ability, that's ob- 
vious, but in most ways he needed those last 
two years in school. He lacks maturity, for one 
thing. He was fine when everything went well | 
at USC, but he couldn't handle adversity. The 


| fact that he couldn't get along with his coach, 


Casey Weldon Florida State 
= tial 3 er “! s / ; ay 


Larry Smith, worries a lot of people. You don't 
think he'll run up against adversity in the NFL? 
You don't think friction between quarterback 
and coach isn’t normal in the pros? Marino- 
vich doesn't look like he can handle those 
problems right now. Physically, there is a 
question about whether he can throw the long 
ball accurately and consistently. He needs the 
sort of polish he could have acquired in two 
more years of college football.” 

Paul Hackett, head coach at the University 
of Pittsburgh and a former NFL quarterback 
coach, makes another point about Marino- 
vich's readiness for the pros. “He comes from 
an offense where the tailback and the running 
game are traditionally strong,” said Hackett. 
“Coming from that system is not like going into 
the pros from a system that is more pass- 
oriented. The development of a pro quarter- 
back still takes between three to six years. The 
more experience a quarterback gets in col- 
lege should lessen his development time.” 

Hackett has a star underclassman, Alex 
Van Pelt, playing quarterback for him at Pitt. 
“Alex had a very good freshman year when 
we had a strong running attack with Curvin 


| Richards,” said Hackett. “He did not have as 


good a year last season, when Curvin was 
hurt. When you play with a top runner, your job 
becomes easier.” This, incidentally, will be 
something of a test season for Van Pelt, since 
Richards left Pitt early to enter the NFL draft. 
Marinovich is a pioneer, in a negative way. 
Jeff George left Illinois with just one year of 


| college remaining. Steve Walsh and Bernie

Kosar had just one year remaining at Miami 
when they opted for the pros, as did Timm 
Rosenbach at Washington State. Marinovich 
is the first to leave with two years remaining. A 
lot of young quarterbacks and their coaches 
will watch Marinovich closely. If he flops, it 
could discourage quarterbacks from leaving 
school after their sophomore seasons. If he 
succeeds, it might encourage other quarter- 
backs to leave school if they enjoy successful 
second years. That inspires anger, as well as 
fear, among the college coaches. 

Pat Dye, the Auburn coach, is unlikely to be 
pulling for Marinovich’s immediate success 
since his own Stan White was the brightest 
freshman quarterback in school history last 
fall. Terry Donahue of UCLA has similar mixed 
feelings. His freshman quarterback, Tommy 
Maddox, outperformed cross-town rival Mar- 
inovich last year. With Maddox available for 
the next three seasons, the Bruins could have 
some form of dynasty in Los Angeles. 

Ron Meyer, the Indianapolis Colts’ coach 
who once was a college head coach at SMU, 
doesn't think that most underclassmen quar- 
terbacks are equipped to come into the NFL 
without their full four years experience. “You 
have to consider the psychological and emo- 
tional factors,” said the man who made Jeff

back Class 


George his starting quarterback for last year's 
opening game. “George was ready. He was 
mature and experienced, able to handle the 
job. When we scouted him, we approached 
him the same way we do a college senior. It's 
too early to offer a judgment on all the quarter- 
backs who left school early, but | do prefer to 
deal with players who have the complete col- 
lege experience.” 

Ware, on the other hand, was not fully 
equipped to take on the NFL. He played only 
one full season for the Cougars, since he suf- 
fered a broken wrist early in his college career 
and his progress was slowed. From a techni- 
cal standpoint, Ware's ability to throw the 
deep pass probably would have been pol- 
ished in his senior season. He went to the 
Detroit Lions as an incomplete quarterback, 


Andy I Kelly JSIVISSSEO 


compounded by the fact that he was a con- 
tract holdout long into training camp. 

“There is another thing about Andre that is 
overlooked,” said a scout who watches a 
great deal of Southwest Conference football. 
“He was never knocked around in his Heis- 
man season. He never took the sort of beating 
that most quarterbacks take at one time or 
another. It’s part of the football experience 
and he went into the NFL without it. He wasn’t 
prepared for the sort of rough treatment he 
ended up getting. If he had played his senior 
year, chances are he would have had a rough 
day or two and then had the experience of 
coming back from it. That’s part of the prepa- 
ration for any quarterback.” 

Ware's decision to turn pro gave Klingler his 
chance. Had Ware returned to Houston for his 
senior year, Klingler might have started just 
one season. As it is, Klingler should be better 
prepared for the pro game in several ways. He 
is much stronger than Ware and, as a one- 
time star basketball player, a better athlete. 
He throws downfield more easily than his pre- 
decessor, too.

Quarterback Class 


John Jenkins, the University of Houston 
coach, detected a noticeable improvement in 
Klingler during spring drills. “David had no 
glaring weaknesses to start with,” said Jen- 
kins. “He already understood defenses and 
how to attack them, but | could see the im- 
provement in the little fundamental things, like 
more polished footwork and the quickness 
with which he read defenses.” At the end of 
last season, Klingler told Jenkins “Things 
were becoming so clear for me in the last 
three or four games that | wish we could play 
another 11-game schedule right now to take 
advantage of what I've learned.” 

“That's called experience,” said Jenkins. 

Since most pro teams prefer a finished 
product, Tennessee's Andy Kelly may rank 
just behind Klingler as a prospect by the time 
this season ends. The Vols’ offense has been 
so balanced during Kelly's time in school that 
he blossomed almost unobtrusively. Kelly fin- 
ished second in Southeast Conference pass- 
ing as a sophomore despite Tennessee's judi- 
cious use of the pass, then showed so much 
progress the next spring that the Vols’ offen- 
sive coordinator, Phil Fulmer, said, “He's as 
much of a threat as any part of our football 
team.” That was higher praise than it sound- 
ed, since Tennessee still had star running 
back Chuck Webb at the time, along with su- 
per receivers Carl Pickens and Alvin Harper. 

The pros like Kelly's chances already. The 
same can't be said for Detmer, Brigham 
Young's marvelous field leader. “Detmer gets 
it done, he's really a great college player,” 


Eric Hunter Purdue 


4 | 
Brian Spurlock 


said an AFC personnel chief, “but he's a little | 


guy who falls into the Doug Flutie category as 
far as being a pro prospect. In fact, Flutie has 
a better arm than Detmer.” 

Except for Klingler and Kelly, the senior 
quarterbacks interest the pros far less than 
the underclassmen. This could change, since 
seniors such as Matt Rodgers of lowa will be 
watched more closely this season. Smaller- 
school quarterbacks, such as Kevin Meger of 
Toledo, will be analyzed in far greater detail. 
Last year, Brent Favre of Southern Mississippi 
didn’t become a pro favorite until late in his 
senior season. 

With the option of leaving school early now 
a fact of life, underclassmen get far more at- 
tention from the scouts than they did in the 
past. Shawn Jones, who led Georgia Tech to 
an undefeated season as a sophomore, has 
been compared in some ways to the Philadel- 
phia Eagles’ Randall Cunningham. But Cun- 
ningham himself didn’t excite the pros until 
late in his senior year at UNLV, and even then 
some of them considered him more as a punt- 
er than a potential starting quarterback. 


Rick Mirer Notre Dame 


Fred Akers, the departed Purdue coach, 
saw his young quarterback, Eric Hunter, as a 
“John Elway type.” Hunter operates out of the 
run-and-shoot, which some pro teams view 
with skepticism. All of them, however, are im- 
pressed by Hunter's record of bringing back 


| the Boilermakers from large deficits. 


The University of Florida averaged 452.6 
yards and 35.2 points per game a year ago 
behind sophomore quarterback Shane Mat- 
thews, who passed for a school-record 2,952 
yards—the second-highest total in Southeast- 
ern Conference history. Matthews is one of 
seven offensive starters returning for the Ga- 
tors this fall. 

When Miami's Craig Erickson suffered an 
injury in his junior year, the Hurricanes were 
placed in the capable care of then-freshman 
Gino Torretta. Erickson was injury-free last 
fall, but the pros still recall Toretta’s work with 
admiration. He is in their future book. 

Elvis Grbac completed his sophomore 
season at Michigan by passing for four touch- 
downs against Mississippi during a 35-3 vic- 
tory in the Gator Bowl. Ole Miss coach Billy 
Brewer was so impressed he said Michigan 
“is the best team we've ever played.” 

And finally, even without Rocket Ismail as a 
battery mate, junior Rick Mirer of Notre Dame 
will be closely watched. 

There are a lot of jobs waiting out there in 
the commercial football world. O

WHY 4 FOOTBALL GAMES? 


To give YOU a choice! Here are 4 great football 
hoard games that have stood the test of time! 


r 1A 

Would 30 years be a good test? 
That's how long Football Strategy 
has charmed table-top gamers. 
It's the first board game to 
emphasize defense as well as 
offense! Called by Sports Illus- 
trated in 1961, “‘the best football 
game ever invented."’ The game 
of think and double-think! On 
defense you secretly select a 
defense you think will stop your 
opponent's next play. He, in turn, 
tries to outguess you by calling a 
play from among 20 on the matrix 
chart patterned after real pro 
plays. Each offense and defense 
selection is cross-indexed to 
obtain the gain or loss. An ad 
executive once said, ‘‘when you 
can get top-notch ad men to pass 
up expense account luncheons to 
play Football Strategy, you have 
a real attraction going for you." 
Another eulogized, ‘‘as ex-college 
players, we have been attracted 
by many good football games, but 
none have approached the realism 
and excitemént of Football 
Strategy.”

...where YOU are the Coach... 
YOU call the Plays on Offense... 
YOU set the Strategy on Defense. 


Paydirt—first published in 1976 
and still going strong! Paydirt is 
FOOTBALL STRATEGY tailored to 
the 28 pro teams. Every pro team 
has been computer-analyzed— 
their strengths and weaknesses are 
coded onto special Play/Action 
Charts. These charts are your 
tickets to realistic action. With them 
you can call all the shots—on 
offense and defense—for every pro 
squad. You can replay the com- 
plete pro season, playoffs, Super 
Bowl...until your team wins it all. 
Maybe Hostetler and the Giants 
shouldn't have won the Super Bowl. 
Paydirt gives you the chance to 
find out who really belonged in the 
playoffs. Each team should produce 
as they did in real life. Except—you 
are the coach. And your decisions 
may be the difference between who 
makes it to the Super Bowl and 
which teams are the also-rans. If 
you already play Paydirt, simply 
order the 1990 Season Play/Action 
Charts only. Past seasons (listed 
below) also available.

Bowl Bound is PAYDIRT tailored 
to college football. Now in its 3rd 
edition, the game comes com- 
plete with Play/Action Team 
Charts of what the computer says 
were the best 20 college teams of 
the 80's. Here, you can match up 
these great teams to find out who 
really was the greatest of the era. 
Each team's real-life perform- 
ances have been encoded on 
both the Offense and Defense 
color-coded Team Charts for each 
team. The depth of this analysis 
is So great that we are confident 
you will find this game unrivaled 
for excitement and true-to-life 
results. However, because all 20 
are nearly even in over-all ability, 
it is YOU, as coach, whose play 
choices make the difference. A 
few of the 20 teams you get 
include ‘88 Notre Dame, ‘87 
Miami, '84 Brigham Young, and 
"83 Nebraska. If you already have 
this 3rd edition Bowl Bound, 
extra sets of Team Charts with 
teams that go back as far as 1941 
are available (see below).

Candidate 


by GERARD KAVANAGH 


The Heisman Trophy should be renamed 

the Junior Achievement Award. The last 
three winners took home college football's 
most prestigious honor in their third year in 
school: Barry Sanders of Oklahoma State in 
1988, Andre Ware of Houston in ‘89, and Ty 
Detmer of Brigham Young last fall. Sanders 
and Ware chose not to stick around for their 
senior year, jumping instead to the National 
Football League. Detmer, however, the first 
player from the Mountain Time Zone to win the 
award, returned to Provo, UT, and thus could 
become the first two-time Heisman winner 
since Archie Griffin of Ohio State in 1974-75. 

The most statistically impressive in a distin- 
guished line of quarterbacks at BYU, Detmer 
led the nation in passing yardage (5,188) and 
was second in pass efficiency and total of- 
fense (418.5 yards per game) a year ago. He 
suffered separations to both shoulders in a 
Holiday Bowl loss to Texas A&M and had sur- 
gery in the offseason. But all reports label him 
as good as new heading into the fall. The 
holder of 42 records, Detmer needs just 446 
yards to become the NCAA's all-time passing 
leader. He'll be operating without eight of the 
offensive starters who helped generate so 
much excitement in the Rockies last season 
as the Cougars face the stiffest schedule in 
school history: Florida State (Street & Smith's 
preseason No. 1) in the Disneyland Pigskin 
Classic, followed by road games with UCLA 
and Penn Siate prior to the Western Athletic 
Conference opponents. 

Detmer's chief competition for individual 
honors should come from Houston senior 
quarterback David Klingler, who finished fifth 
in the Heisman vote. The understudy to Andre 
Ware in 1989, Klingler was elevated to the first 
string after Ware forfeited his final year of col- 
lege eligibility to enter the NFL draft. Klingler 
promptly led the nation in total offense (474.64 
yards per game), throwing for 5,140 yards 
and an NCAA-record 54 touchdowns. He had 
48 completions against SMU last October, 11 
touchdown tosses against Eastern Washing- 
ton in November, and 716 yards passing 
against Arizona State in December. In Hous- 
ton’s intrasquad game this past spring, 


a 


Su] 2OSSy UIESUWeg / COYOOS LO 


Mazio Royster 
Southern Cal 


Klingler passed for a preposterous 1,901 
yards and 17 TDs. The Cougars open the sea- 
son at home against Louisiana Tech and trav- 
el to Illinois (where just one starter returns in its 
secondary) for their third game. In between is 
a road date with Miami, against whose formi- 
dable defense Detmer passed for 406 yards 
and three touchdowns last September. 

In addition to Detmer and Klingler, two other 
juniors were among the top six in the Heisman 
balloting. Notre Dame tailback Raghib (Rock- 
et) Ismail, the runner-up, gave up the amateur 
life when he signed with Toronto of the Cana- 
dian Football League. But unlike the legend- 
ary Argonauts, he obtained the golden fleece 
(a guaranteed $18 million) without encounter- 
ing a single hazard. Herman Moore likewise 
surrendered his final season at Virginia to join 
the Detroit Lions. 

Tico Duckett, Glyn Milbum, Mazio Royster, 
Shane Matthews, Shawn Jones, Alex Van Pelt, 
Elvis Grbac, Jason Verduzco, Stephen 
McGuire, Jeff Sydner, Tracy Good, and Mar- 
cus Grant are all highly rated skill-position 
players who will begin junior year this fall. 
Thus they merit Heisman consideration. 


“ ™3 
| know the formuta for win ae 


man,” said Michigan State coach George 
Perles. He plans to factor tailback Tico Duck- 
ett into the Spartans’ offensive equation. The 
leading returning rusher inthe nation, Duckett 
(1,394yards) shared the position MM g90Iwith 
the Med Hyland Hickson, who also ran 
for 1,000 yards:."If Tico gains 2,000 yards, 


he's got a chance™=said tles.. Michigan 
State was still iooking <a abort ons to 
hand the ball.to Duckett and pass it to Court- 
» ney ‘au. who missed five garnes put 


Us stilh 31 catches for 474 yards. He also 
punts and kickoffs 


Glyn Milburn of Stanford returns kicks. He 
took a puntiback 73 yatdo emai in 


the Cardinal opener before being caught at 
the one-yard line. That was the first lime Mil- 
bum had touched the ball in a game in over.a 
year, for he had to sit out a season following 
his transfer from Oklahoma. Milburn might be 
the most exciting and versatile runner since 
Nebraska's Johnny Rodgers, the Heisman 
winner in 1972. He was No: { in the nation in 
all-purpose yardage (2,222), second in the 
Pac-10 in punt returns (11.1 yards) and third 
in kickoff returns (24.7) and was named first- 
team all-conference as a runner and second- 
team as a kick returner. “Glyn has established 
himself as the finest all-around offensive 
threat in college football,” said Stanford 
coach Dennis Green. “He is a jack-of-all- 
trades and has the characteristics to master 
them all.” 

Mazio Royster is the Pac-10's leading re- 
turning rusher. He got a late start, taking over 
for the injured Ricky Ervins in Southern Cal's 
fourth game and finishing the season with 
1,168 yards, only the third Trojan sophomore 
(after Anthony Davis and Charles White) to 
gain 1,000 yards. 

Florida's Shane Matthews, the Southeast- 
erm Conference Player of the Year, passed for 
a school-record 2,952 yards as the Gators av- 
eraged 452.6 yards and 35.2 points per 
game. He is one of seven returning starters for 
coach Steve Spurrier, whose team is now eli- 
gible for the league championship. 

Georgia Tech won a share of the national 
championship thanks in large part to quarter- 
back Shawn Jones, who directed an offense 
that produced a school-record 2,285 yards 
and 379 points, the most at Tech since 1918. 
The MVP of the Yellow Jackets’ 45-21 Florida 
Citrus Bowl victory over Nebraska, Jones has 
been compared to the Philadelphia Eagles’ 
Randall Cunningham for his versatility and his 
penchant for the spectacular play 

All-East quarterback Alex Van Pelt is only 
the second player in Pitt history to throw for 
more than 2,000 yards in consecutive sea- 
sons. "Alex had a very good freshman year 
when we had a strong running attack with Cur- 
vin Richards,” said Panthers’ coach Paul 
Hackett. “He did not have as good a year last 
season, when Curvin was hurt. When you play 
with a top runner, your job becomes easier.” 
Van Peit will play this fall without Richards, 
who skipped ahead to the NFL, but the other 
nine offensive starters return 

Elvis Grbac set a Michigan mark with 21 
touchdown passes, including four in the Gator

fullback Stephen McGuire (621 yards). With 
21 touchdowns in his first two seasons, he 
could be the Hurricanes’ top runner since Ot- 
tis Anderson and the first since Anderson in 
1978 to gain 1,000 yards. 

If Detmer was the first player from the Moun- 
tain Time Zone to win the Heisman, Jeff 
Sydner of Hawaii could be the first candidate 
off the mainland to be considered for the Tro- 
phy. He led the WAC and was fifth nationally in 
1990 in all-purpose running (163 yards per 
game). He had 390 yards rushing, 820 receiv- 
ing, and 748 in kick returns. 

Tracy Good and Marcus Grant should 
command attention this fall simply because 
they will be on the receiving end of Klingler's 
tosses. They combined for a modest 104 re- 
ceptions in the run-and-shoot offense in ‘90, 
but Grant collected 943 yards in receptions 
(yes, 943 yards) in that spring scrimmage. 

Of course, the Heisman Trophy won't nec- 
essarily be won by a junior. Senior quarter- 
backs Andy Kelly of Tennessee, Casey Wel- 
don of Florida State, and Matt Rodgers of 
lowa should have something to say about in- 
dividual and team honors this fall. Kelly com- 
pleted 59 percent of his passes for 2,241 
yards and earned a reputation for clutch play, 
as exemplified by his drive for the clinching 
touchdown in the Vols’ 23-22 Sugar Bowl vic- 
tory. Weldon went undefeated after winning 
the starting job at midseason. Third in the na- 
tion in passing efficiency, he threw for 1,600 
yards and 12 TDs with just four interceptions 
and is called “a young Joe Montana” by his 
coach, Bobby Bowden. Rodgers passed for 
2,228 yards and 15 touchdowns and ran for 
nine more scores for the Hawkeyes 

Pat Rowe of San Diego State is the leading 
returning receiver in the country (71 for 1,392 
yards and 8 TDs). He carries an NCAA record 
of nine consecutive games with at least 100 
yards receiving into the fall. Derek Brown was 
Notre Dame's second-leading receiver, be- 
hind Rocket Ismail. He plays the less glamor- 
ous position of tight end, but at 6-7 and 243 
pounds he is an unmistakable target and a 
devastating blocker 

A trio of sophomores are worthy of recogni- 
tion for their exploits as freshmen. Robert

Smith of Ohio State piled up 1,126 rushing 
yards and eight touchdowns and has excited 
Buckeye fans more than any tailback since 
Archie Griffin. Russell White of California 
shared running chores with Anthony Wallace 
a year ago, but like Duckett and Hickson at 
Michigan State, each gained 1,000 yards. 
White still finished seventh in the nation in all- 
purpose yards (159.6), returned his first home 
kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown against Mi- 
ami, and became the first player ever to earn 
first-team all-Pac-10 honors without starting a 
single game. Quarterback Tommy Maddox of 
UCLA outperformed crosstown rival Todd 
Marinovich of Southern Cal. He was first-team 
frosh All-America, one of 10 finalists for the 
Davey O'Brien Award, and finished second in 
the Pac-10 and 20th nationally in passing effi- 
ciency (2,682 yards and 17 TDs). O

ON PHOTO DAY at Jack Daniel Distillery we like 


playing practical jokes, especially on one another. 


From the look of things, someone sneaked some 
sawdust in our new distiller’s cap. And, rest assured, 
it won't be long before he does something to 
even the score. You see, playing 

practical jokes is a part of life here at 

Jack Daniel’s. So is making whiskey = 
in the rare, rare way our friends have i 
come to expect. And, we promise, 
none of these gentlemen would 
ever joke around about that—no 
matter what day it is.

Street & Smith’s 
1991 High School 
All-America 
Team 


If the 10th annual 50-player Street & Smith's 
College Football High School All-America 
team has a familiar ring to it, there's a reason: 
Several of the honorees have fathers, broth- 
ers, or cousins making sports-page news. 

Consider the eight quarterbacks. Chuck 
Clements of Huntsville, TX, is following in the 
footsteps of brother Steve, a record-setting 
1989 quarterback and Street & Smith's honor- 
ee who's now at the University of Texas. Chris 
Walsh of Cretin-Derham High in St. Paul, MN, 
is breaking all of the school records set by 
brother Steve, a former University of Miami 
quarterback now with the New Orleans Saints. 
Kevin Foley of Cherry Hill, NJ, East High is 
regarded as a better prep quarterback than 
brother Glen, the current Boston College start- 
er. Eric Boykin of Meadowdale High in Dayton, 
OH, has four cousins playing major-college 
football. Ted Stark of South Medford, OR, who 
plays quarterback, defensive back, and 
punts, is a brother of touted Stanford tennis 
player Jonathan Stark. And defensive back 
Bobby Taylor of Longview, TX, is the son of the 
1972 Olympic silver-medalist sprinter. 

Obviously, athletic talent flows in the fam- 
ilies, but all 50 members of our preseason 
team—based on coast-to-coast recommen- 
dations from prep writers, scouts, and college 
and high school coaches—boast impressive 
credentials. For example, the quarterbacks: 

Boykin, a three-sport performer with a B- 
plus academic average, passed for 2,490 
yards and 22 touchdowns last season.

WHEELING INTELLIGENCER 


high school report 


Clements, a first-team Class 5A all-stater 
and B-average student, connected on 200 
of 362 passes for 2,919 yards and 29 TDs. 

Chad Davis of Torrey Pines High in Del 
Mar, CA, could threaten some national ca- 
reer aerial records this season. In his first 
three years, including two at Palm Springs 
High, he has completed 485 of 783 passes 
for 6,953 yards and 57 TDs with only nine 
interceptions. A three-sport athlete with B- 
average grades, Davis chalked up 1,957 
yards last season while playing, like Cle- 
ments, for his father-coach. 

Ryan Driscoll led lowa state champion 
Marion Linn-Mar to a 13-0 record by passing 
for 2,200 yards and 22 TDs. A three-sport 
athlete with B-plus grades, he might try both 
baseball and football in college. 

Foley set a South New Jersey record with 
2,626 passing yards last season while earn- 
ing all-state recognition. He tossed 23 TD 
passes and completed over 60 percent of 
his throws. 

Rodney Hudson of LaGrange, GA, is a 
pass-run threat with 4,962 total yards and 56 
touchdowns, including 3,979 passing yards 
and 42 TDs the last two years. 

Deondre Singleton was a rare junior first- 
team all-stater in Illinois as he led perennial 
state title contender East St. Louis with 2,479 
passing yards and 33 touchdowns with only 
five interceptions. 

Walsh, another three-sport stalwart with 
B-plus academics, opened some eyes by 
passing for 2,515 yards and 23 TDs with a 
60 percent completion ratio and only six in- 
terceptions last season. 

Three of the four Utility Player selections 
also competed as quarterbacks. 

Stark, a basketball standout and golfer 
and an A-minus student, was an all-star on 
offense, defense, and as a punter. 

Some Florida observers feel Tommie Fra- 
zier of Bradenton Manatee is the best option 
quarterback anywhere after he led the Hurri- 
canes to a 12-1 record and the state’s top 
offensive output. He passed for 1,553 yards 
and 13 touchdowns and rushed for 793 
yards and 18 TDs while scoring 124 points. 
The four-sport performer also returned 
kicks. He earned all-state honors as well as 
being the only junior on the all-South selec- 
tions of the Orlando Sentinel. 

Mark Smith has earned Missouri all-state 
recognition as a Webb City linebacker and 
quarterback the last two seasons. On of- 
fense, he passed for 19 touchdowns with 
only four interceptions and rushed for 33 
TDs in two seasons. 

Leon High of Tallahassee, FL, is home to 
do-it-all Tamarick Vanover, who earned all- 
state recognition last season while playing 
running back, defensive back, wide receiver 
and kick returner. He chalked up 1,989 all- 
purpose yards, including 930 rushing and 
655 receiving, while scoring 20 TDs. 

Here is a summary of the remainder of the 
Top 50 honor roll: 


36 


RECEIVERS 

Jason Curry is a three-sport performer and 
B-average student at Montclair, NJ, and 
earned all-state football recognition last fall 
while grabbing 28 passes for 647 yards and 
seven TDs. 

Indiana’s top senior college prospect 
could be Derrick Mayes of North Central 
High in Indianapolis after he earned all-state 
plaudits as a junior while catching 45 
passes for 710 yards and five TDs. 

At John Marshall High in Oklahoma City, 
OK, observers feel they have the top receiv- 
er around in all-stater Mike McDaniels, who 
hauled in 56 passes for 1.067 yards and 12 
TDs last season. The B-student has timed 
10.6 seconds for 100 meters and is a bas- 
ketball standout. 

Union High won the South Carolina Class 
4A title with a 14-1 record last fall and amain 
reason was Monty Means, who caught 52 
passes for 1,090 yards and 12 TDs. 

The top college prospect in Northern Cali- 
fornia could be Amani Toomer, who had 35 
receptions for 793 yards and 13 TDs during 
a 13-0 record season at Concord De La 
Salle last fall. Toomer also finds time to com- 
pete in basketball and track. 

At Westlake, LA, High, fans get used to 
seeing a 6-foot-6, 260-pound tight end. He’s 
David LaFleur, who also plays defensive 
end and linebacker. The B-student is a 
weightman during track season. 

The No. 1 student in the senior class at 
Garden City High in Kansas is Jim Moore, a 
straight-A teen in the classroom as well as in 
football, basketball, and baseball. As a tight 
end, he grabbed 20 passes for 379 yards. 
He is also a touted linebacker. 


RUNNING BACKS 

Steve Anderson of Downingtown, PA, aver- 
aged 45 yards for each of his 20 touchdown 
runs last season while gaining 1,556 yards 
on 176 carries. Dwayne Chandler of Aber- 
deen, MS, rushed for 1,551 yards and 22 
TDs on 191 yards and draws raves from 
all the scouts. 

The top back in Alabama is Robert Davis 
of Homewood High in Birmingham, who en- 
ters his senior season with 4.110 yards and 
47 TDs on 650 carries. Last season, he led 
the state Class 5A runner-up team with 
2,268 yards and 33 TDs, including five on 
kick returns. Steve Davis of Spartanburg, 
SC, is a 6-3, 215-pound sprinter who rushed 
for 1,536 yards and 18 TDs as a junior after 
winning the state 100-meter dash title in 10.4 
seconds as a sophomore. 

Jeff Godley of Sam Houston High in Ar- 
lington, TX, tied the state record held by Billy 
Sims by rushing 441 times last season. God- 
ley gained a Class-5A-best 2,564 yards. 
Chris Jaquillard was selected the Ohio Back 
of the Year after rushing for a Toledo city- 
record 1,993 yards for Woodward High last 
season. The previous mark was held by past 
Street & Smith's selection Chuck Webb, who 
later starred at the University of Tennessee. 
Jaguillard enters his final season with 3,430 
career yards. 


Essex Law averaged 10.9 yards per carry 
for Rochester, PA, High last season and 
added three kickoff-return TDs for good 
measure. Robert Toomer is Georgia's top 
back after gaining 5,422 yards and scoring 
70 TDs with 906 career carries for Worth 
County High of Syivester. 


KICKER 

The nation's top kicking prospect competes 
for an eight-player California program. He's 
Eric Abrams, who sports an A-plus average 
at La Jolla Country Day school. Last season, 
he kicked 98 of 103 kickoffs into the end 
zone and coverted 74 of 79 PATs (with 125 
for his career). He has a 53-yard field goal 
and kicked a 65-yarder in summer camp 
competition. For every kick he makes in a 
game, he raises money for the Make-A-Wish 
Foundation for terminally-ill patients. 


OFFENSIVE LINEMEN 

Some scouts feel the No. 1 prospect in the 
nation is a two-sport standout at Bakersfield 
High in California, which went 13-0 last sea- 
son and is a riding a 39-game victory streak 
after sending nine seniors to Division | col- 
lege football programs. He's ali-stater Jeff 
Buckey, who bench presses 400 pounds 
and sports an A-plus average. In track, he 
tossed the discus a U.S -best 210 feet early 
last spring. 

Another California standout is Joe Wells of 
Arroyo Grande, a four-year requiar who is of 
Cherokee Indian heritage. 

Pennsylvania also has two offensive line 
honorees in returning all-staters Harvey 
Pennypacker of Boyertown and Jeff Craig of 
Connellsville, who also is No. 1 in his class 
with a straight-A average. Both are heavy- 
weight wrestlers, too. 

Ohio's top lineman is Korey Stringer, who 
impressed as Warren Harding won the state 
Division | title with a 14-0 record. 

Newport High of Bellevue, WA, was state 
runner-up as 15-year-old Ryan Padgett 
showed promise of things to come. Also a 
skier, he boasts a 3.9 grade average. The 
No. 1 offensive lineman in a state noted for 
interior talent is Thomas Guynes of Bishop 
McNamara in Kankakee, IL. He's a three- 
sport star. 

For exceptional size, check out the District 
of Columbia and Bradenton, FL. In D.C., 
Jonathan Ogden (6-9, 320 pounds) is a B- 
student at St. Albans and also a standout 
track weightman. At Southeast High in Bra- 
denton, Reggie Green (6-8, 310) earned all- 
State recognition as a 16-year-old junior as 
the college scouts started to line up. 


DEFENSIVE LINEMEN 

The top line prospect in Alabama is Ken- 
drick Burton of Hartselle, who dominates the 
defensive line of scrimmage when not play- 


STREET ANO SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


ing tight end. At 6-6, 270 pounds, he also 
holds several school weightlifting records. 

Three other Southern man-mountains 
along the line are Marcus Jones of South- 
west High in Jacksonville, NC; Will Lyell of 
Brandon, MS; and Ronell Williams of Bay- 
side High in Virginia Beach, VA. Jones is a 
three-sport performer who charted 18 
sacks, 16 tackles for losses, three blocked 
kicks, and scored four defensive TDs last 
season. Lyell is a 3.9 student and all-state 
returnee courted by numerous colleges. Wil- 
liams, who was the Most Valuable Player on 
Bayside’s state championsip basketball 
squad last season, is a defensive nightmare 
for most opponents who caused 13 fumbles, 
blocked 15 pass attempts, and scored four 
TDs in 14 games the last two years. 


LINEBACKERS 

James Gillyard is labeled by some Shreve- 
port, LA, observers as the finest football 
player in that area since the days of quarter- 
backs Joe Ferguson and Terry Bradshaw. 
Also a basketball and track standout, the 
Woodlawn High B-average student has 
played wide receiver and defensive back. 
He returned two punts and two pass inter- 
ceptions for TDs last season and had 16 
tackles for losses plus six fumble recoveries. 

The top prospect in Arizona already has 
given the University of Southern California a 
verbal grant-in-aid commitment. He's Jon 
McGee of state runner-up Amphitheater 
High in Tucson, alma mater of Los Angeles 
Raider linebacker Riki Ellison. 

The top prospects in Missouri and Michi- 
gan are linebackers: Ed Morrow of McCluer 
High in Florissant, MO, and Antonio Ragland 
of Chadsey High in Detroit. Morrow, a three- 
sport athlete and football all-stater, record- 
ed 135 tackles and six pass interceptions 
last season. Ragland, an all-city football 
honoree and basketball performer, was also 
a dominating figure at tight end. 


DEFENSIVE BACKS 

Bobby Taylor may be the top senior pros- 
pect in talent-rich Texas. The Longview ath- 
lete with a B-average has blocked six punts 
in two seasons and last year returned two 
pass interceptions and three kickoffs for 
TDs. He also plays wide receiver and run- 
ning back. A four-year basketball regular, he 
starred in track as a sophomore when he 
was a member of a 1,600-meter relay unit 
which clocked a U.S.-best 3:11.06 time. 

Shawn Summers set a school-record 
rushing total of 1,825 yards for tradition-rich 
Oak Ridge, TN, last fall. But he excels on 
both sides of the ball. He has gained 3,009 
yards and scored 33 TDs in two seasons 
and stars as a free safety. 

Sean Hamlet is a three-sport perfomer for 
perennial Virginia power Hampton and 
earned first-team all-state for the state run- 
ner-up team. He returned three punts for 
TDs and also handled receiver duties. 

Laquan Harris is a multitalented two-way 
perfomer for Elizabeth, NJ, which expects to 
have one of the state's better teams this fall.

Round up the usual suspects. It's time to 
choose the preseason top 25 teams. 
Start in the South, where the Sunshine State 
usually has a lot to say about determining the 
national champion. 

Florida State defeated Penn State, 24-17, in 
the Blockbuster Bowl for a 10-2 record and 
No. 4 final ranking, its lowest in five years. The 
Seminoles haven't finished ahead of Miami 
since 1982 and their rivalry continues this fall 
at Doak Campbell Stadium, where a brawl 
nearly precipitated the game in '89. Bobby 
Bowden, with over 200 victories, is still seek- 
ing that elusive first national crown. He'll re- 
mind his 17 returning starters that expecta- 
tions were high in Tallahassee in 1988, when 
the Seminoles’ title aspirations were blown in 
a 31-0 opening-game rout by Miami. This 
time, Florida State opens with Brigham Young, 
which upset Miami last September behind 
Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Ty 
Detmer's 406 passing yards and three touch- 
downs, and closes with Miami (November 16) 
and Florida (November 30). 

Miami, playing on New Year's Day for the 
eighth straight season, demolished Texas,

46-3, in the Cotton Bowl and wound up No. 3 
in the polls, its lowest position since 1982. The 
Hurricanes must replace 11 starters, includ- 
ing quarterback Craig Erickson and defensive 
tackle Russell Maryland, the first pick in the 
NFL draft. The new quarterback likely will be 
Gino Torretta, who already holds the school 
record for passing yards in a game (468). He 
won three of his four starts as an injury re- 
placement for Erickson in Miami's 1989 cham- 
pionship season 

Throw the University of Florida, off proba- 
tion at last for past NCAA rules violations, into 
the lineup of title contenders. The Gators re- 
turn 17 starters from the fun-and-shoot team 
that produced a 9-2 mark and over 452 yards 
and 35 points per game and ranked fifth in the 
nation in total defense 

Michigan's 9-3 record a year ago was 
slightly misleading. The Wolverines outplayed 
Notre Dame in their opener only to lose, 28— 
24, and suffered one-point setbacks to Michi- 
gan State and lowa. But they closed with a 
rush, winning their final six games, including a 
35-3 decision over Mississippi in the Gator 
Bowl. Taking over for coach Bo Schem- 
bechler, Gary Moeller fashioned a typically 
awesome Michigan line in an atypically potent 
passing offense. Junior Elvis Grbac threw a 
school-record 21 touchdowns, 17 of which 
went to Desmond Howard and Derrick Alex- 
ander, who also return. But parity was the key 
at the top of the Big Ten last fall as lowa, 
Illinois, and Michigan State tied Michigan for 
the league title. Ohio State figures to chal- 
lenge that foursome for the Rose Bowl bid 

Notre Dame could lobby for the trip to Pasa- 
dena for the Irish open with four games 
against Big Ten teams. They lost three games 
and Raghib Ismail a year ago. They are not 
likely to lose that many again and in Willie 
Clark, a converted safety, they have a tailback 
even faster than the Rocket 

Miami is off the Notre Dame schedule but 
Tennessee and Penn State, top 10 teams with 
premier defenses, remain. The Volunteers 
went to the Sugar Bowl as the Southeastern 
Conference champion (Florida was ineligible) 
and defeated Virginia, 23-22. They have to 
plug the backfield hole created when Chuck 
Webb left school prematurely for the NFL, but 
in quarterback Andy Kelly and receiver Cari 
Pickens Tennessee has a pro-style passing 
combination. Penn State, which becomes an 
official member of the Big Ten in 1993, over- 
came an 0-2 start to win nine consecutive 
games and capture a 20th Lambert/Meadow- 
lands Trophy

Colorado survived a bonehead decision to 
punt to Notre Dame's Ismail in the closing sec- 
onds of the Orange Bowl. When Rocket's 
touchdown return was nullified by a penalty, 
the Buffaloes escaped with a 10-9 victory and 
a share of the national championship (AP 
poll). How well quarterback Darian Hagan’s 
surgically-repaired knee responds this sum- 
mer will determine how far an inexperienced

Bowl, 46-34, and may have been the stron- 
gest team in the nation at that point. But the 
Huskies’ prospects for a national champion- 
ship dimmed this spring when versatile quar- 
terback Mark Brunell injured his knee. He un- 
derwent surgery and may be out for the sea- 
son. The Pac-10 features a wealth of youthful 
skill-position players in tailbacks Russell 
White of California, Glyn Milburn of Stanford, 
and Mazio Royster of Southern Cal and quar- 
terback Tommy Maddox of UCLA. 

The most glamorous player in the country 
last year was Detmer, who hurt both shoulders 
in a Holiday Bowl loss to Texas A&M. He sat 
out spring drills following rehabilitation but 
now appears strong. Most of his supporting 


iw 


cast, however, has departed as the Cougars 
defend their WAC title with just two other re- 
turning offensive starters. If BYU gets by a 
nonconference schedule that pits it against 
Florida State, UCLA, and Penn State in its first 
three games, start preparing the story line on 
two-time Heisman winners. 

David Klingler passed up an opportunity to 
join former Houston teammate Andre Ware in 
the pro ranks. If he throws for 5,000 yards 
again, he could outpoll Detmer for individual 
honors this time. The Cougars, off NCAA pro- 
bation and eligible for a bowl bid, face a stern 
test at Miami in September before heading 
into Southwest Conference piay against pe- 
rennial powers Texas A&M and Texas

Division I-AA 
National Preview 


by DAVID NEWTON 


THE (COLUMBIA) STATE 


The folks in Statesboro, GA, weren't too 
pleased with their new football coach 
four weeks into the 1990 season. How could a 
man take 12 starters from a 15-0 national 
championship team and lose three of four 
games? The old coach, Erk Russell, never 
had a losing season, they grumbled. Russell 
also won a higher percentage of games than 
any coach in NCAA Division I-AA the past de- 
cade with a team that played football as a club 
sport in 1983, they reminded. Just who the 
heck did this Tim Stowers fellow think he was, 
ruining their program? 
“| just went ahead and put a For Sale sign in 
the front yard,” Stowers said with a laugh. 
Stowers can laugh now. Georgia Southern 
won its final 11 games to win the I-AA title for 
the fourth time in six seasons. The Eagles de- 
feated Nevada, 36-13, in the championship, 
played for the second straight year near the 
banks of Eagle Creek in Statesboro. But don't 
be surprised if Stowers didn't save that For 
Sale sign. With 15 starters back and the 
championship once again at Alien E. Paulson 
Stadium, expectations will be just as high. 
“When you have the kind of success we 
have, it's kind of like the San Francisco 49ers,” 
sports information director Jim Stephan said. 
“When they don't make the Super Bowl. . .'Oh, 
boy. What's wrong?’ When you've been in five 
of the last six championships, everybody be- 
gins pointing toward it at the beginning of the 


‘Steve Bussoletti 


season—like another game on the schedule 

The opposition is beginning to think the 
same way. “As long as they play at home 
they'll always be penciled in the champion- 
ship,” claims Northeast Louisiana State coach 
Dave Roberts. Says Furman coach Jimmy 
Satterfield, “Whoever wins the national cham- 
pionship has got to go through Statesboro 

Literally. For the past two seasons, the Ea- 
gles’ playoff trave! budget hasn't been 
touched. They've played all eight games in 
Statesboro, a financial boom for |-AA football 
and a decisive edge for the home team. Few 
complained two seasons ago. Most coaches 
were too Caught up in the excitement of see- 
ing 25,725 fans at the championship—that 
many didn't see the previous three com- 
bined—and fans ripping down the goal posts 
following the 37-34 thriller. Administrators 
were too caught up in the financial windfall 
they'd found in Statesboro, where fans have 
been witness to a fare dynasty in an era of 
sports parity 

Four playoff games and another title later, 
though, opinions changed—at least those of 
the coaches. Most had no probiem with the 
championship returning to Statesboro. But 
giving the Eagles the home-field advantage 
throughout the playoffs raised a few eye- 


brows. “| don't care what anybody else says 
nobody should have the right to play every 
game al home.” Eas ® 


Kidd said. "We're

Gorden also admits he envies what Georgia 
Southern has done. Most of the credit, he and 
others agree, should go to athletic director Dr. 
David “Bucky” Wagner. It was Wagner's 
dream to see football return to Statesboro. He 
laid the foundation by hiring Russell from the 
University of Georgia and building one of the 
strongest I-AA booster programs in the coun- 
try. He also spearheaded the construction of 
an 18,000-seat stadium, called by one publi- 
cation the "prettiest little stadium in America.” 
And he orchestrated the deal that brought the 
championship game to Paulson Stadium for 
three straight years. 

“Hey, I'm happy for what they've done,” 
Roberts said. “Their A.D. has made I-AA a 
profitable means for the playoffs. People are 
making money, whereas five years ago they 
didn't make any. They've turned the champi- 
onship into a bowl atmosphere. That's just 
outworking everybody. In our coaches meet- 
ings, | told them if they don't like it, put up a 
bid for the championship. It's a free country.” 

Nevada coach Chris Ault agrees. He 
blames last year's championship loss on the 
Georgia Southern option as much as on the 
home-field advantage, although he compared 
playing the Eagles at home to playing Notre 
Dame in Vatican City. “But the bottom line is 
they put money on the line and were willing to 
back it,” he said. "So they've earned it." 

Stowers isn't sold on this home-field-advan- 
tage talk. Yes, the Eagles had a 38-game 
home winning streak and a 42-1 record at 
Paulson Stadium before Eastern Kentucky de- 


48 


feated them, 42-34, on September 22. But 
Stowers says knowing the title game is in his 
backyard brings a pressure to succeed that 
negates much of the advantage. He felt the 
same pressure following Russell 

“Sure, there's added pressure to get to the 
championship game,” Stowers admitted 
“There's also added incentive. The way | look 
at it, Georgia Southern the last couple of years 
has been carrying the I-AA banner and show- 
ing people around the country just how good 
I-AA football is. If peopie want to cry about 
Georgia Southern getting to the champion- 
ship, | remind them they had the same chance 
to bid in 1989 as we did.” 

Stowers took the same stoic attitude when 
Georgia Southern was 1-3. After opening with 
a victory over Valdosta State, the Eagles lost 
at Middle Tennessee State, among the na- 
tion's premier |-AA teams, and at Florida 
State, which is consistently among the top 10 
I-A programs. Then came Eastern Kentucky, a 
perennial |-AA powerhouse that was ranked 
No. 1 during the season 

“It was a very difficult time,” Stowers said 
“People look on you as winners and losers. | 
was looked upon as a loser. But [the fans] 
jumped back on the bandwagon.’ 

Stowers knows they just as easily could 
jump off again. He's already been confronted 
by fans speaking of a “'three-peat.” He began 
warning his players about overconfidence 
during spring drills. “It’s hard to be hungry on 
a full stomach,” he said. “They may go to the 
beach and somebody might see them in 4 
Georgia Southern T-shirt and say, ‘Do you 
play for Georgia Southern?’ They'll say, “Yeah, 


Larry Stayner

we won the national championship.’ Their 
heads will swell. It’s very difficult to keep them 
headed in the right direction 
2 task will become even more difficult in 

1993. when Georgia Southern begins its first 
season in the Southern Conference, arguably 
the toughest I-AA league in the country. Gone 
are the days of independent scheduling, 
where Stowers could mix a few lightweights in 
between heavyweights on the schedule 
Many coaches argue scheduling gave the Ea- 
gles as much of an advantage as the site 
committee because they always had “easy” 
games to heal their wounds. In two years they 
will face a steady diet of Furman, The Citadel 
Appalachian State, Marshall. and East Ten- 
nessee State 

‘It probably will be tougher for Georgia 
Southern to win the Southern Conference than 
the national championship.” Stowers said 
‘It’s like a mini-SEC 

Funny. Stowers sounds like coaches from 
other leagues who profess the same thing 
‘It’s true,” said Satterfield, who was against 
Georgia Southern entering the league. “May- 
be this will be the greal equalizer 

Gorden hopes so 
healthy for one team to b

like people wanted to beat the Yankees back 
in the early ‘40s, you don't want the same 
teams winning year in and year out,” he said. 

But the same teams do win year in and year 
out. Furman, Eastern Kentucky, Middle Ten- 
nessee State, Youngstown State, Boise State, 
and many others are in the playoffs just as 
often as Georgia Southern is in the champion- 
ship. The Southern, Southland, and Big Sky 
conferences are always the best-represent- 
ed. The formula for all is the same: an offense 
based on a sound running game and a solid 
defense. Russell used it for eight years, com- 
piling an 83-22-1 record. “If you go back and 
check the tally each year, I'd say nine of the 
top 10 teams fit those qualities,” Stowers said. 

Stowers sees no reason for this season to 
be different. If he can fit a few pieces together, 
he likes his chances for a third straight title. 
First, he must find a replacement for quarter- 
back Raymond Gross, who ran the option to 
perfection in the 1990 title game, rushing for 
145 yards on 31 carries. Georgia Southern 
was 44-8 with him at the helm. “Finding the 
right man will be critical,” Stowers said. 

It's a situation the Eagles have faced be- 
fore. When they lost Tracy Ham [the first play- 
er in college history to rush for more than 
3,000 yards and pass for more than 5,000, 
and the Eagles’ quarterback on the 1985 and 
‘86 national title teams], everybody thought 
they would fall apart then,” said Roberts. 
“Look what happened. | don't think many peo- 
ple feel too sorry for them because they don't 
have a quarterback back,” Roberts said. 

Too many coaches are worried about find- 
ing their own quarterback. Over half the teams 
ranked in the final top 20 poll last season are 
in the same situation. The most intriguing story 


is at Massachusetts. This would have been 
Gary Wilkos's junior year, but Wilkos broke his 
neck in the seventh game last season and will 
not play football again. Before the injury, Wil- 
kos had rushed for 526 yards and three touch- 
downs, passed for 733 yards and four touch- 
downs, and led his team to an undefeated 
record. Massachusetts finished 8-2-1, includ- 
ing a loss to William & Mary in the first round of 
the playoffs. 

“We're 2-2 A.G.—after Gary,” Minutemen 
coach Jim Reid said. “I'm not sure we'll be 
able to maintain.” 

Perhaps Reid should talk to Ault about a 
trade. The Nevada coach used two quarter- 
backs en route to the championship game 
and says both will play again this year. Junior 
Fred Gatlin started most of the season, pass- 
ing for 2,364 yards and 17 touchdowns. Chris 
Vargas played every down in seven overtime 
periods, including two straight triple-overtime 
victories in the playoffs. 

Statistically, the nation's leading quarter- 
backs are back. North Carolina A&T's Connell 
Maynor led the country in passing efficiency a

year ago, completing 64 percent of his 
throws. Weber State's Jamie Martin led the 
nation in total yards, with 3,700. Three of |- 
AA’s top rushers also are back, led by Joe 
Campbell of Middle Tennessee State. Camp- 
bell averaged 7.5 yards per carry and scored 
13 touchdowns for the team that finished the 
regular season ranked No. 1. 

Middle Tennessee also has the toughest 
break in scheduling for 1991. Because South- 
east Missouri becomes eligible for the Ohio 
Valley Conference championship, the Blue 
Raiders must play at Eastern Kentucky for the 
second straight year. EKU coach Roy Kidd 
figures he deserves the break. His Colonels 
were 10-0 in 1990 before losing quarterback 
Lorenzo Fields with a broken ankle. They lost 
their final regular-season game and then drew 
1988 champion Furman in the first round of 
the playoffs. “I really thought we were good 
enough to win it all,” Kidd said. With 15 return- 
ing starters, including six all-Ohio Valley play- 
ers, he should have another shot. So should 
Northeast Louisiana, the class of the South- 
land once again with running back Roosevelt 
Potts back for his junior year. 

Marshall could be the nation’s dark horse. 
The Thundering Herd was 6-5 (4-3 in the 
Southern Conference) a year ago. But four of 
their losses were to playoff teams, three to top 
10 teams by three points apiece. Furman re- 
mains the team to beat in the Southern, de- 
spite fewer scholarships and higher academ- 
ic standards than most of its competition. The 
Paladins were right behind Georgia Southern 
in winning percentage during the 1980s. 

“We're a Duke kind of an institution,” Satter- 
field claimed. "I think we can still maintain that 
kind of tradition.” 

Against the tradition of a Georgia Southern? 

“Heck, | thought they were out of it at 1-3 
last year,” Satterfield said. “I didn't think 
they'd be the factor they were. They did a 
heck of a job coming back, no matter what 


anybody says about them.” a

LOUISVILLE COURIER-JOURNAL 


When Pete Rozelle was commissioner of 
the NFL. the buzz word was “parity.” 
Pundits used to say that Rozelle would not be 
happy until the year when every team finished 
8-8. Rozelle would have loved the Big Ten last 
year. For the first time in history, four teams 
tied for the league championship, with a 6-2 
record, and a fifth was only a half-game back. 
Things were so tight that when Michigan's 
J.D. Carlson kicked a 37-yard field goal with 
No time remaining in the final game against 
Ohio State, it affected the fate of four teams. If 
the kick had failed, Ohio State instead of Mich- 
igan would have tied for the league title and 
Illinois instead of lowa would have gone to the 
Rose Bowl. 

Don't be too surprised if 1991 is a virtual 
repeat of 1990. Of the four teams that tied for 


STREET ANO SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


the championship—lowa, Illinois, Michigan, 
and Michigan State—only the Illini seem un- 
likely to repeat. And even if they tumble, they 
won't fall very far. Meanwhile, Ohio State 
seems poised to make a serious run for the 
Rose Bowl. Indiana, which returns most of its 
Peach Bow! squad, could sneak up on some 
teams. Even Minnesota, which finished only a 
game back of the leaders, is feeling pretty 
chesty going into the season. But the Gophers 
are on probation and won't be going any- 
where at bowl time. 

Michigan is the likely favorite for the Rose 
Bowl bid because of the strength of its of- 
fense. Gary Moeller opened up the atlack in 
his first season and the Wolverines are no 
longer a one-dimensional team. They have 
strength in the offensive line, running backs, 
receivers, and quarterback. But like everyone 
else, Michigan has a potential flaw: its defen- 
sive backfield. 

lowa, which surprised everyone last year 
when it gained the Rose Bow! berth after go- 


ing 5-6 the year before, wan't surprise anyone 
this time. That is, unless the Hawkeyes lose 
more than two conference games. Their run- 
ning probably won't be as strong as a year 
ago, but everything else is on track. 

Ohio State has some weaknesses, includ- 
ing a recent history of inconsistency that has 
some Buckeye fans doubting whether John 
Cooper is the man to bring them back to glory. 
But Ohio State also has some awesome talent 
sprinkled throughout its lineup. 

Michigan State's problem is a big one. The 
Spartans don't have a quarterback. Or, if they 
have one, coach George Perles doesn't yet 
know who it is. If he finds out, the Spartans 
have a shot at the Rose Bowl, too. 

Illinois is an unknown after losing most of its 
defense. But the Illini were even more of an 
unknown in John Mackovic’s first year in 1988 
and they ended up playing Michigan for the 
Rose Bowl bid that November. 

Indiana probably isn't good enough to chal- 
lenge for the conference championship, but 
the Hoosiers will be a factor and could break 
into the first division again. 

Minnesota might be nipping at the heels of 
the leaders but it's unlikely the Gophers will 
pull many surprises the way they did last year 
when they handed Indiana its first defeat and 
later knocked off league-leading lowa. 

The other three Big Ten teams will be also- 
rans once again. Northwestern lost its two 
best players but returns almost everybody

Michigan 


else and thus has a chance to move up a bit. 
Purdue, because of its defense, should im- 
prove under new coach Jim Colletto. Wiscon- 
sin had better improve under Barry Alvarez. 

In a few years Penn State will be joining the 
Big Ten, but Notre Dame seems to be beating 
the Nittany Lions to it. The Irish open their 
season with four games against Big Ten 
teams. That will give Lou Holtz a chance to 
see whether he has any chance to contend 
again for a national championship. Holtz 
showed signs of strain last year when his team 
lost two regular-season games and needed 
the luck of the Irish to win a few others. Their 


67 


luck ran out in the Orange Bow! when Rocket 
tsmail’s apparent game-winning touchdown- 
return of a Colorado punt was wiped out by a 
clipping penalty that may or may not have 
occurred, depending on which school you 
were rooling for. The fact that Holtz was an 
integral part of the NCAA investigation of Min- 
nesota's football program did not help his 
peace of mind, either. But no one doubts his 
ability to develop consistently outstanding 
football teams, and this year's edition proba- 
bly will be no exception. No one, except pos- 
sibly Holtz, knows who the new Ismaiis, Chris 
Zoriches, and Michael Stonebreakers will be, 
but there will be a talented player replacing 
each of the departed superstars. 

As for the other independents, Northern Illi- 
nois is facing a crossroads season. The Hus- 
kies lost not only Stacey Robinson, who led all 
college quarterbacks in rushing and touch- 
downs, but head coach Jerry Pettibone as 
well. New coach Charlie Sadler has to rebuild 
against a much tougher schedule than the 
one on which the Huskies too often stubbed 
their toes last year. 

Gerry Faust appears in for a rough year at 
Akron after losing most of his defense. Cincin-

nati may be building something under Tim 
Murphy, but so far only the foundation is in 
place. It will be at least another year before 
the walls go up and a year beyond that before 
Bearcat fans can even think of raising the roof. 

As for Youngstown State, the Penguins are 
becoming a power in Division I-AA and they 
probably are capable of beating any of the I-A 
independents in the area except for Notre 
Dame. They beat Faust's Zips last year. 

Perhaps no conference has enjoyed more 
parity than the Mid-American, where Central 
Michigan became the first team in 10 years to 
defend its title successfully. Even at that, the 
Chippewas tied with Toledo at 7-1 and went to 
the California Raisin Bowl because of a 13-12 
victory over the Rockets. Central Michigan, 
the nearest thing to a dominating team in the 
MAC, will be hard-pressed to “threepeat” be- 
cause four first-team all-MAC players are 
gone. The Chippewas lost seven starters on 
defense and three on offense but should have 
enough depth to be in the race. Toledo must 
teplace 12 starters, which could open the 
door for Western Michigan to rule the roost. 
The Broncos tied for third in the MAC and 
claim 14 returning starters. 

The Ohio Valley Conference adds one more 
school this season, but the same two teams 
probably will dominate. Middie Tennessee 
State and Eastem Kentucky tied for the 1990 
OVC title and the perennial powers look to 
square off again this fall. Their meeting will be 
September 21 at Eastem Kentucky, and the 
game site itself is enough to stew some folks 
at Middle. The addition of Southeast Missouri 
State to the OVC (Tennessee-Martin will be 
eligible in 1992) ted to some rescheduling, 
and one of the changes put Middle Tennes- 
see at Eastem both in 1980 and ‘91. The Colo- 
nels have six all-OVC players, a 1,000-yard 
tailback, and 15 starters returning. Middle 
Tennessee, whose only regular-season toss 
was at Eastem, lost 16 starters.

MICHIGAN 

(9-3, 6-2) Michigan was the best team that 
never had a chance to win the national cham- 
pionship last year. The Wolverines outplayed 
Notre Dame in a season-opening 28-24 loss 
and were 3-3 after dropping one point deci- 
sions to Michigan State and lowa. But they 
won their last five regular-season games to 
gain a share of the Big Ten title and were 
absolutely awesome in demolishing Missis- 
sippi in the Gator Bowl. They rolled up 715 
yards in that 35-3 victory. 

The Wolverines should be a national con- 
tender again in Gary Moelier's second year as 
head coach. But they have to overcome a bru- 
tal schedule. For a change they don't open 
against Notre Dame. After visiting Boston Col- 
lege, the Wolverines host the Irish and Florida 
State back-to-back. Then they go on the road 
to lowa and Michigan State to open the con- 
ference season. If Michigan gets through that 
minefield without blowing itself up, there 
should be no real problem until the season 
closer against Ohio State. 

If Moeller has a major problem—other than 
that schedule—it is rebuilding his defensive 
backfield, which loses All-America safety 
Tripp Welborne as well as standouts Vada 
Murray and David Key. Only cornerback 
Lance Dottin retums from that unit, although 


wo 


late-season injuries to some of the starters 
gave Otis Williams and Corwin Brown some 
game experience at the safety spots. The only 
other departed players on defense are middie 
guard T.J. Osman and linebacker John Milli- 
gan. The three retuming linebackers are led 
by all-league standout Erick Anderson, who 
has led the team in tackles for an unprece- 
dented three straight seasons. Both defensive 
tackles, Mike Evans and Chris Hutchinson, 
are back. They had 13 sacks between them in 
Big Ten play, with Evans sharing the confer- 
ence lead with seven. 

The strength of this Michigan team should 
be its offense. Not many teams can lose a 
talented sophomore like Jon Vaughn, who ran 
for 1,364 yards and nine touchdowns, and 
barely even miss him. The Wolverines can. 


STREET AND SMITHS COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


Even before Vaughn opted for the NFL draft it 
was becoming apparent that he might not be 
the best tailback on the team. Vaughn was 
sensational early in the season, but in the last 
four games he was being overshadowed by 
true freshman Ricky Powers, who rushed for 
100 yards or more in each of them. Fullback 
Jarrod Bunch may be harder to replace. 

Quarterback is set with Elvis Grbac, a 6-5 
flinger who set a school record with 21 touch- 
down passes last year. Four of them came in 
the Gator Bow! blitz over Ole Miss. Significant- 
ly, hose 21 TD passes more than doubled his 
interceptions (10). Grbac is blessed with one 
of the country's top receivers in Desmond 
Howard, who caught 63 for 1,025 yards last 
year. Eleven of those went for touchdowns 
and Howard added another score on a 95- 
yard kickoff return against Michigan State. His 
29.5-yard kickoff-return average ranked sec- 
ond in I-A. Flanker Derrick Alexander, who 
caught 31 passes good for 450 yards and six 
touchdowns, gives Grbac another inviting tar- 
get. Dave Diebolt is the tight end. 

The offensive line will be typically awesome, 
even if guard Dean Dingman and tackle Tom 


John Derby 


lowe 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


penak (6-8, 322) is an All-America. Joe Co- 
cozzo started eight games at guard while 
Dingman was hurt and Matt Elliott started all 
12 games, alternating between guard and 
center. He'll be back at guard and Steve Ever- 
itt, who started the first three games and the 
Gator Bowl, will be at center. 

if that’s not enough offense, kicker J.D. 
Carlson may be the best in the Big Ten. 


IOWA 
(8-4, 6-2) A new dance craze swept through 
lowa last year—the Hokey-Pokey. Actually it’s 
an old dance but it took on new meaning when 
coach Hayden Fry led his Hawkeyes through 
il after each of their upset victories. And there 
were lots of them. The Hawkeyes beat Michi- 
gan State, Michigan, and Illinois, all on the 
toad, to win a share of the Big Ten title and the 
Rose Bowl bid. But as often happens with 
Fry's team, the dancing shoes wore out to- 
ward the end of the season. The Hawkeyes 
lost two of their last three Big Ten games, in- 
cluding one to Minnesota that kept them from 
winning the title outright. Then they were em- 
barrassed in the Rose Bowl by Washington. 
The Hawkeyes won't sneak up on anybody 
this fall, as they may have done a year ago. 
But they may not have to. There are 14 starters 
and most of the backup people returning from 
last year. Some of the losses, however, are 
significant. Nick Bell, a 260-pound toad at tail- 
back gained 1,009 yards, scored 12 touch- 
downs, and was the Big Ten MVP. Defensive 
tackle Jim Johnson, though not as awesome 
as he had been the year before, was first-team 
all-conference. So were defensive back Mer- 
ton Hanks, linebacker Melvin Foster, tight end 
Mike Titley, and defensive tackle Malt Ruh- 
land. All are gone. So is Tony Stewart, Bell’s 
dancing partner, who split time at the position 
and gained 844 yards.

But Fry’s glass is more than half full. For 
starters, there's all-league quarterback Matt 
Rodgers, who passed for 2,228 yards and 15 
touchdowns. He also ran for nine touchdowns 
and became only the third lowa quarterback 
to throw for 2,000 yards in conseculive sea- 
sons. Danan Hughes (29-410) and Jon Filloon 
(20-322) are back to receive Rodgers’s offer- 
ings and most of the offensive line also re- 
turns. Center Mike Devlin and tackle Rob Bax- 
ley were all-league second-teamers. Starters 
Scott Davis and Ted Velicer also return and 
there is experience behind them. 


Obviously someone will have to replace the 
Bell-Stewart tandem. Scooter Lampkin (38- 
161, 3 TDs) and Mike Saunders, used mostly 


‘at wide receiver last year, will get the first 


crack. Saunders had two 100-yard rushing 
games earlier in his career. Fullback is in 
good hands with returnees Lew Montgomery 
and Paul Kujawa. 

Replacing the two outstanding tackles on 
defense will be a prime concem, but at least 
nose guard Red Davis (6-4, 270), who led the 
team in tackles for loss, is back. Both starting 
ends, Leroy Smith and Moses Santos return, 
along with their top backups. Although Foster 
is gone, John Derby, the team's third-leading 
tackler, returns at the other linebacker spot. 
Top reserves Ted Faley and Mike Dailey will 
fight it out for Foster's job. The loss of Hanks, 
who started 48 games in his career at lowa, is 
mitigated by the fact that everyone else in the 
secondary returns, including starters Eddie 
Polly, Brian Wise, and Doug Buch. Backups 
Jason Olejniczak and Gary Clark each had 
three interceptions. 

Kicking was a problem for the Hawkeyes 
last year. Jeff Skillett is accurate inside the 40 
but was only 1-for-6 beyond that. Punting 
sometimes was a disaster, blocked punts 
costing at least one game. 

The Hawkeyes have gone back to Fry’s fa- 
vorite kind of schadule—an easy one —with 
nonleague games against Hawaii, lowa State, 
and Northern tilinois. They get Michigan at 
home, but in the last two seasons lowa has 
played better on the road. 


OHIO STATE 

(7-4-1, 5-2-1) The Buckeyes are back. Sounds 
like an echo, doesn't it? That was the word on 
Ohio State last year, too. It almost came true 
when the Buckeyes upset lowa late in the year 
and had a shot at the Big Ten title when they 
faced Michigan in the annual showdown. But 
those who were able to stay awake throughout 
the Buckeyes’ listless 23-11 loss to Air Force 
in the Liberty Bowl may find it hard to take 
Ohio State seriously. You'll just have to take it 
on faith. There is too much talent in Columbus 
for the Buckeyes to fail to challenge for Big 
Ten and possibly national honors. 

It's true that considerable talent has depart- 
ed, but there's plenty left, particularly on of- 
fense. With the return of tailback Carlos Snow, 
who missed all of fast year with an injury, Ohio 
State is as deep in backfield talent as any 
team in the country. Even without him the 
Buckeyes would be loaded. Tailback Robert 
Smith, who racked up 1,126 yards and eight 
touchdowns as a true freshman, has Buckeye 
fans more excited than any back since Archie 
Griffin. He broke Griffin's freshman running re- 
cord, by the way. There's strength at fullback, 
too. Scottie Graham, brilliant in 1989 but hob- 
bled with an injury last year, is healthy again 
and Raymont Harris, who scored eight touch- 
downs as Smith's backup at tailback, will 
switch to fullback now that Snow is on hand. 

There will be a new quarterback with the 
departure of Greg Frey, who threw for more 
than 6,000 yards in three seasons but never 
captured the hearts of the hard-to-please 
Buckeye fans. The probable starter is Kent 
Graham, a transfer fram Notre Dame who saw 
some action last year (15-26-2, 195 yards, 3 
TDs). But redshirt freshman Joe Pickens was 
one of the most highly recruited quarterbacks 
in the country and he'll challenge for playing 


69 


time. The top two receivers, Bobby Olive and 
Jeff Graham, have departed and backups 
Bernard Edwards and Brian Stablein caught 
only 22 passes between them. But Cooper is 
hoping finally to get a healthy season out of 
tight end Jeff Ellis, who has missed most of the 
last two years with injuries after being touted 
as an All-America prospect. 

The offensive line is always a strength at 
Ohio State and will be again. The only serious 
problem will be in replacing center Dan Beat- 
ty. Guard John Peterson also is gone but Roy 
Nichols (6-5, 295), who started seven games 
at tackle, started the final three at guard. The 
other guard is junior Len Hartman (6-2, 280). 


Alonzo Spellman 
Onto State 


one tackle and sophomore Alan Kline (6-7, 
285) is being hailed as a budding superstar 
after starting five times as a freshman. 

Defensively, the Buckeyes began to show 
some of their old muscle last year, led by sen- 
sational newcomer Steve Tovar. The 6-4, 240 
inside linebacker had 125 tackles, forced 
three fumbles, recovered two, and had 6% 
tackles for loss. Atonzo Spellman (6-5, 265) 
was moved from linebacker to defensive end 
last year and was not as explosive as he had 
been as a freshman. With a year's experience, 
he should be a force. Already a force is nose 
guard Greg Smith (6-2, 255), who tied for the 
Big Ten lead with seven quarterback sacks. 
The other starting down lineman, tackle Rich 
Frimel (6-3, 250), returns for his senior year. 

Cooper is hoping to get outside linebacker 
John Kacherski back from the injured list to 
replace Jay Koch. The other linebackers, Ja- 
son Simmons and Tom Lease, return. The big- 
gest problem on defense is in the secondary, 
where only cornerback Foster Paulk is avail- 
able. Among those who must be replaced is 
comerback Vinnie Clark, a first-round pick in 
the NFL dratt. 

The Buckeyes play only three road games 
since the Northwestern game has been 
switched to less-than-neutral Cleveland. The 
key game once again could be at lilinois Octo- 
ber 12, since Cooper is 0-3 against the Mlini. 


MICHIGAN STATE 

(8-3-1, 6-2) 1f Reggie Jackson is Mr. October, 
then George Perles is Mr. November. Peries’s 
Michigan State teams have not lost a game in 
November since 1986. Once again the Spar- 
tans started slowly in 1980 but came on like 
gangbusters to earn a share of the Big Ten

Mick Shoaf (6-6, 290) is a returning starter at 


Tico Duckett 
Michigan Siaté 


title and a hard-fought 17-16 victory over USC 
in the Sun Bowl. It isn't that Perles doesn't 
have his team prepared early. It’s just that 
most of the Spartans’ tough games are 
jammed into the front part of the schedule. 
And a Perles team almost never loses a game 
it should win. The Spartans’ fate was decided 
in the sixth game last season when they lost, 
15-13, on a last-second field goal at Illinois. A 
victory would have meant the Rose Bowl, 
since the last five opponents were out of the 
title hunt. 

Perles thinks his team can make it to Pasa- 
dena this time despite some key losses. The 
one that had him most concerned was at 
quarterback, where Dan Enos left a big void. 
There were four players vying for the position 
in spring ball and nothing was resolved. One 
of the prospects was Bret Johnson, a transfer 
from UCLA, who may have miscalculated if he 
thought playing time could be bought more 
cheaply at Michigan State. Whoever gets the 
job in the fall will be throwing to one of the best 
wide receivers in college in Courtney Haw- 
kins, who missed five games but stili caught 
31 balls for 474 yards. Hawkins also returns 
punts and kickoffs. 


The offensive line once again needs re- 
building, but there is usually a wealth of build- 
ing bricks at Perles’s command. This time the 
cormerstone will be tackle Jim Johnson (6-5, 
300) an all-Big Ten performer. Parles likes to 
run the ball—the Spartans fed the Big Ten in 
rushing—and he has the runners to do it. The 
big name is tailback Tico Duckett. the leading 
returning rusher in the nation. Duckett (257- 
1,394) shared time last year with Hyland Hick- 
son, who also gained 1,000 yards, and Perles 
likely will try to develop another strong back- 
up. At the same time he has announced he 
wants Duckett to win the Heisman Trophy. 
saying, “| know the formula for winning the 
Heisman. If Tico gains 2.000 yards next year, 
he’s got a chance.” Meanwhile, freshman Se- 
bastian Small likely will get most of the carries 
that Duckett doesn't get 

Defense. of course. is Peries’s trademark, 
and although he’s lost seven starters, he sees 
no reason the Spartans won't be strong again. 
“We're exactly where we were a year ago 
when we had to replace seven starters.” he 
said. “We proved !ast year thai we can do that 
and still play the kind of defense we expect at 
Michigan State.” The top return:ng players on 
defense are middie Linebacker Chuck Bul- 
lough and end Bill Johnson (6-4, 289). De- 
spite losing such outstanding performers as 
linebackers Carlos Jenkins and Dixon Ed- 
wards and tackle Bobby Wilson, Peries is 
more concerned with the condition of his sec- 
ondary. where three starters have left. The 
one who remains, however, cornerback Alan 
Haller, was honorable mention all-Big Ten 

5 ora rayeuans = one 


a 


cr

“Haller and Todd Murray give us a good nu- 
cleus in the secondary,” said Perles. “That's 
an area we can improve quickly.” 

One area that needs little improvement is 
punting. where Josh Butland returns, but the 
hunt is on for a new place-kicker. 


INDIANA 

(6-5-1, 3-4-1) Will wonders never cease? Not. 
apparently, at Indiana while Bill Mallory 
coaches the football team The Hoosiers ap- 
peared headed for a fall after Anthony Thomp- 
son left, but in reality they were headed for the 
Peach Bowl, where they nearly upset Auburn. 
And now, with 17 starters returning, Indiana 
could be headed for the Big Ten first division. 
\t hinges, mostly, on whether an improving de- 
fense can get even better. A year ago, Mallory 
said the defense needed to improve “three or 
four notches.” This year, it just needs tweak- 
ing. “It still needs to go up another notch,” 
said Mallory. 

The offense needs only fine-tuning. There 
are nine starters returning, although that is a 
little misleading because one of them, tight 
end Todd Walker, is moving to fullback, which 
was wiped out by graduation. A year ago. 
Mallory also thought he could coach 1,000 
years and never find another tailback like 
Thompson. Now. after plugging Vaughn Dun- 
bar into Thompson's. old stot, Mallory is ex- 
claiming: “Dunbar can be one of the top run- 
ning backs in the country. He has the tools 
and he's got the same heart and stamina as 
Anthony.” He also had 1,224 rushing yards 


FREE J-SHIRT 


WITH A ONE-YEAR 
SUBSCRIPTION 


and 13 touchdowns last year, helping to kick- 
start the Hoosiers to a 4-0-1 recard before 
reality set in. The Hoosiers lost four of their 
next five but rebounded to beat archrival Pur- 
dué and earn their fourth bowl bid in five sea- 
sons. Tight end Walker is one of several can- 
didates to replace the tandem of Ernie 
Thompson and Cal Miller at fullback. That pair 
totaled 627 yards. Another prospect is Corey 
Taylor, converted from linebacker. 

There's no question this year about who will 
play quarterback. At least that's what Mallory 
says. Last year he went into the fall insisting 
that walk-on Chris Dyer was the man. Yet 
when the Hoosiers lined up for their first snap, 
it was long-time backup Trent Green under 
center. Dyer eventually got his shot when 
Green faltered at midseason, but after Green 
had scored three touchdowns against the 
vaunted Auburn defense, Mallory said, 
“There's no question at quarterback. He's 
more mature, has a lot of confidence, and the 
players respond to him.” 

The offensive line often was in chaos last 
year, but out of chaos comes stability. Mallory 
has three tackles who started at least seven 
games last year and three guards who started 
from four to seven. Center Jason Mack started 
the last 10. Few teams have much depth and 
experience. The biggest problem—and it 
could be a huge one—is replacing wide re- 
ceiver Rob Turner (33-717). 

On defense only three starters are gone, 
but that includes both safeties, Mike Dumas 
and Dave Ane. Dumas was the team’s Most 


Valuable Piayer and an all-Big Ten perfarmer. 
But there is a solid corps of returning fine- 
backers, headed by Mark Hagen, a second- 
team all-conference pick, and big-play spe- 
cialist Greg Farrall. Hurvin McCormack (6-4, 
255), who lettered as a true freshman, will re- 
place tackle Brian Hunnicut, the only depart- 
ing down lineman. 

Place-kicking is another strength with Scott 
Bonnell already up to No. 6 on the school’s 
career scoring list with two years remaining. If 
there is anything to disquiet Mallory it might be 
@ peek at the schedule. The Hoosiers open at 
Notre Dame and also must face Michigan, 
lowa, and Ohio State on the road. 


ILLINOIS 

(8-4, 6-2) For a team that had won only two Big 
Ten championships in the previous 36 years, 
Iltinois seemed pretty unimpressed with its 
four-way share of the conference title in 1990. 
And with good reason. The Illini had gone into 
the season aiming much higher than that. The 
targets—the Rose Bowl and a national cham- 
pionship—did not seem all that unhittable. 

But the national championship hopes be- 
gan to crumble in the first 30 minutes of the 
season when Arizona built up a big half-time 
lead on the way to a 28-16 upset. The Rose 
Bow! dreams were shattered in a §4-28 hum- 
bling by lowa in the pivctal game of the sea- 
son. And, finally, a 30-O humiliation at the 
hands of Clemson in the Hall of Fame Bowl 
made it a season that, on balance, was less 
than memorable.

Jason Verduzco 
ilinois 


Not that there weren't some memorable mo- 
ments. Illinois was the only team to defeat na- 
tional champion Colorado. Tailback Howard 
Griffith set an NCAA record with eight.touch- 
downs in a game against Southern Illinois. But 
Griffith is gone, along with 14 other starters, 
and coach John Mackovic is almost back 
where he started. But not quite. When he ar- 
tived in 1988, Mackovic found few proven 
performers awaiting him, but a welter of un- 
tested talent. Among those players were nose 
guard Moe Gardner, linebacker Darrick 
Brownlow, defensive backs Henry Jones and 
Chris Green, and tackle Mel Agee. All of them 
are gone, too, after contending for the Big Ten 
title in each of the last three seasons. 

Mackovic still has a nucleus of good play- 
ers schooled in his system. Since the Illini vir- 
tually missed out on an entire recruiting class 
during the last coaching changeover, howev- 
er, most of the talent once again is young and 
untested, especially on defense. With only 
three starters back, Illinois cannot expect to 
be as steady defensively as it has been, for 
the most pari, the last three years. But even 
with its veteran-laden team, there were some 
breakdowns at awkward times last year. 

Because they play Houston in the third 
game of the season, the Illini are probably 
going to find their inexperience in the defen- 


72 


sive backfield most obvious in the early going. 
Only free safety Marion Primous is back from 
the starting group, but his backup, Mike Hop- 
kins, started four games last year. Up front. 
junior Erik Foggey (6-3, 289) will replace All- 
America Gardner at nose tackle, and big 
things are expected from him. Sean Streeter, 
(6-3, 270). a sometime starter over the last two 
years, also is back at an outside tackle spot. 
Both Mike Poloskey and Julyon Brown have 
starting experience at outside linebacker, but 
freshmen and sophomores will be manning 
the inside spots. Redshirt freshman Dana 
Howard is highly touted. 

‘Things are much more settled on offense. 
where quarterback Jason Verduzco stands 
tall, or as tall as a 5-9 quarterback can stand. 
Whatever the reasons Illinois did not live up to 
expectations in ‘90, Verduzco wasn't one of 
them. Called on to replace Jeff George. the 
No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, Verduzco led the 
Big Ten in passing efficiency while throwing 
for 2,567 yards. He has two years remaining 
and Mackovic expects him to get even better. 

While Shawn Wax, who fed the squad with 
60 catches, is gone, four other experienced 
receivers return, led by Elbert Tumer (23-310) 
and Steven Mueller (32-496). Both starting 
tight ends graduated but Dave Olson, who 
converted two of his five catches into touch- 
downs, will start. The offensive line is an- 
chored by All-America candidate Tim Simp- 
son (6-2, 284), one of the top run blockers in 
the country. Tackles Tony Laster (6-3, 281) 
and Brad Hopkins (6-3, 300) also return. Run- 
ning back is a mystery with the departure of 


3 eos 5 


all-everything Griffith. Wagner Lester. the sec- 
ond-leading rusher (66-253), has moved to 
fullback, where he'll spfit time with Kameno 
Bell. Steve Feagin. a disappointment in his 
sophomore year, had a good spring and is the 
top candidate to start at tailback. 


MINNESOTA 

(6-5, 5-3) Just when things were looking up at 
Minnesota, the Gophers were hit by a one- 
year bow! ban as penalty for infractions that 
occurred during Lou Holtz's brief reign. Now it 
will be up to coach John Gutekunst to keep his 
team focused on winning for its own sake. The 
only other tangible prize, a Big Ten champion- 
ship, seems oul of range, although Minnesota 
finished only a game out of first last year and 
has 16 starters returning. . 

There is enough talent on hand for the Go- 
phers to be respectable but not enough for 
them to leapfrog over the likes of Michigan, 
Michigan State. lowa. and Ohio State. Even 
though they won five conference games, in- 
cluding the 31-24 victory over lowa that 
knocked the Hawkeyes out of an undisputed 
championship, last year’s Gophers ranked in 
the bottom half of the teague in most offensive 
and defensive categories. Still, they might 
have gotten that coveted bowl bid last year 
but for one disastrous play in the season 
opener against Utah. Attempting to kick a 
game-winning freld goal on the final play, the 
Gophers saw it blocked and returned 91 
yards for a Utah touchdown 

There are no marquee names on this Go- 
pher team. The player with the best shot for 
Star billing is quarterback Marque! Fleetwood. 
and it’s not just because his first name is only 
a typographical error away from being up in 
lights. As a sophomore Fleetwood was voted 
the team’s outstanding offensive player after 
winning the job from incumbent Scott Schaff- 
ner. Fleetwood replaced Schattner after the 
Gophers had fallen behind, 19-0, in the first 
quarter of the opener. His statistics were not 
particularly glittering, just 1.199 yards 
passing, but he was the team’s second-lead- 
ing rusher, with 268 yards—including 128 in 
losses, most while attempting to pass. Schafi- 
ner also returns for his senior year to provide 
valuable backup service. 

Gutekunst didn't expect to be able to re- 
place star running back Darrell Thompson, 
and he didn’t. But Mark Smith did a creditable 
job with 700 yards and five touchdowns. Most 


2 tt = : a 


STREET A?.O SMITHS COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


of the other running backs also return. Unfor- 
tunately, the Gophers have only three fetter- 
men—two of them starters—returning on the 
offensive line. Tne hardest to replace will be 
center Chris Thome. Kevin Grant, the top wide 
receiver though not a starter, is gone, but Kes- 
wic Joiner, who averaged 20 yards per catch, 
is a deep threat. 

Linebacking is the strength of the Gopher 
defense, where all three starters are back. Se- 
nior Joe! Staats is the anchor of the unit. Up 
front, Mike Sunvold and Skeeter Akre must be 
replaced, but end Ben Williams (6-1, 240) and 
tackle Gary Isakson (6-4, 277) are returning 
starters. Another strength is in the secondary, 
where three of the four starters return. Senior 
safety Sean Lumpkin is the standout here. He 
had a 75-yard interception return against Ohio 
State—one of four he picked off last season— 
and led the team in tackles. 

Gutekunst is looking for a kicker to replace 
Brent Berglund, who had three field goals 
longer than 45 yards last year. The Gophers 
might have taken some heart from the fact that 
Nebraska is off their schedule, but the Corn- 
huskers have been replaced by Colorado. 


NORTHWESTERN 

(2-9, 1-7) Northwestern loses just two starters 
from its offensive unit, but that’s like saying the 
Dodgers of the mid ‘60s had all of their pitch- 
ers back except Sandy Koufax and Don Drys- 
dale. Running back Bob Christian and wide- 
out Richard Buchanan are, in coach Francis 
Peay's view, “irreplaceable,” but someone in 
purple will lug the bail this fall and someone 
will catch it. Make that some ones. 

“No one running back will be able to pro- 
duce as much (939 yards) as Bob Christian 
did for us,” said Peay, “but we feel confident 
that Eric Dixon, Curt Zipfel, Terry Smith, and 
Bobby Jackson can perform well. Buchanan 
was a big part of our offense, but we have 
some quality depth at the receiver position.” 

For a change, there is also some quality 
depth on the offensive line, abetted by the fact 
that fifth-year senior Darry! Ashmore (6-7, 
279), plagued by injury the last two years, is 
moving from defensive tackle to the offensive 
line. Another switch finds David Woollard (6-4, 
282) going back to center from tackle, where 
he played last year. Ashmore’s switch means 
that one of last year's starters will be odd man 
out; to begin with, it will be Tobin Buckner, 
who will back up Ashmore. 

Quarterbacking seems to be in good hands 
with the emergence of Len Williams, who in his 
first year became the first Northwestern quar- 
terback since Mitch Anderson in 1973 to 
throw more touchdown passes (12) than inter- 
ceptions (10). Williams also is an accom- 
plished scrambler. 

On the other side of the bali there are seven 
starters returning, leading Peay to believe that 
the progress that was begun a year ago can 
continue. To be sure, Northwestem did have 
one midseason stretch where the defense 
looked just as porous as it had in the 0-11 
campaign of 1989. But in the final two games 
of the season, the Wildcats began to show 
some claws as they almost upset Michigan 
State and Illinois back-to-back. 

Linebacking appears to be a strength, 
headed by senior Ed Sutter, who led the Big 
Ten with 161 tackles last year. Tom Homco, 
who missed the final four games of the season 
with a foot injury, still was second on the team 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


with 65 tackles. He'll start alongside Sutter at 
an inside backer spot. The line is anchored by 
fifth-year senior Dan Freveletti. Frank Bou- 
Greaux, who led the team with eight tackles for 
loss, is another returning starter. Although two 
of the four defensive backs return, Peay is 
concerned about replacing free safety Pat 
New. Still, “We hope that an improved de- 
fense will produce more victories,” Peay said. 


PURDUE 

(2-9, 1-7) When Fred Akers installed the run- 
and-shoot offense at Purdue, it seemed natu- 
tal for a school that has turned out passing 
quarterbacks the way John Deere turns out 


tractors. But Akers only ended up shooting 
himself in the foot when the new system pro- 
duced another losing season. Akers resigned 
under pressure and was replaced by Jim Col- 
letto, a former Boilermaker assistant and more 
recently the offensive coordinator at Ohio 
State. Colletto immediately junked the cun- 
and-shoot, which had produced the top pass- 
ing offense in the Big Ten, and installed the I- 
formation as his basic offense. 

Of course, no coach can ignore Purdue's 
heritage except at his peril, and Colletto won't 
stop throwing the ball. After ail, sophomore 
quarterback Eric Hunter did pass for 2,355 
yards and 12 touchdowns. And nine of the top

10 receivers are back, led by Ernest Callo- 
way, who caught 47 for 541 yards. Of course, 
several of the receivers were running backs 
who gained more yards catching the football 
than lugging it. 

The top runner, Tony Vinson, gained only 
198 yards all season as the Boilermakers av- 
eraged but 55.6 yards per game on the 
ground. It was the sixth straight year that Pur- 
due had failed to average 100 yards rushing 
Colletto hopes to change that, but, then, so 
did Akers. The good news for Purdue is that 
the top nine rushers will return. Of course, that 
could also be the bad news considering their 
most recent performances. Colletto did sign 
Chicago prep standout Corey Rogers. Only 
two starters remain from an offensive line that 
hardly distinguished itself, giving up 39 sacks 
for 300 yards. Colletto will start to rebuild 
around center Bob Dressel (6-5. 290) and 
tackle Denny Chronopoulos (6-5, 290) 

Defensively, the new coach may have more 
to work with. There is a good nucleus of re- 
turning linebackers and down linemen. Tackle 
Jeff Zgonina (6-3, 270), who blossomed when 
he switched from linebacker, led the confer- 
ence linemen with 123 tackles, 20 of them 
behind the line of scrimmage. Tackle Frank 
Kmet (6-4, 264) is starting to live up to his 
potential. Three veteran linebackers, led by 
Jim Schwantz, should solidify Colletto’s new 
5-2 defense. Schwantz had an outstanding 
year in 1989 but broke a foot at the beginning 
of last season and was slow to return. The 
secondary must be replaced, including 
standout cornerback Steve Jackson. 

One thing Colletto hopes will change is the 
Boilermakers’ turnover ratio. They coughed 
up the ball 40 times on interceptions and fum- 
bles and snatched it away only 16 times. 


WISCONSIN 
(1-10, 0-8) If progress is measured only in 
victories and losses, then Wisconsin took a 
tiny step backward last season, its first uncer 
new coach Barry Alvarez. The Badgers were 
2-9 the year before. But the crowds started to 
come back to Camp Randall and. as the sea- 
son progressed, so did the Badgers. By the 
end of the year they were able to throw a 
scare into powerful Michigan State before los- 
ing, 14-9. Still, there are miles to go before 
Alvarez can sleep easy. The offense, particu- 
larly the running game, was abysmal. Only 
once in conference play did the Badgers gain 
as much: as 300 total yards, and that was 
against Northwestern. 

The Badgers lost most of their offensive 
line, returning only 300-pound guard Chuck 


Belin. Fullbacks Mark Montgomery and Kevin’ 


Ellison return, but Montgomery totaled only 
116 yards for the season, Ellison 100. Both 
were coming off position changes, however, 
and Alvarez hopes the year’s experience will 
help. Robert Williams gained 541 yards as the 
starting tailback, and while that might not 
seem like much, it is the best by a Badger 
back since 1987. 

Tony Lowery, who had quit the squad the 
previous year, returned to quarterback the 
Badgers last season and did a creditable job 
His 1,757 passing yards were fourth-best in 
school history. But he threw for only five touch- 
downs, compared with 13 interceptions. Of 
course, he did not have a big-time receiving 
corps, either. The best of the returning receiv- 
ers are Tony Spaeth (29-290), Lionell Craw- 


74 


ford (26-288) a converted quarterback. and 
Tim Ware (24-473). Ware, with his 19.7-yara 
average per catch, is the most dangerous 
threat. Alvarez considers tight end to be a 
team strength, although starter Dave Czech 
caught only 11 bails for 116 yards 

Defensively there is a bit more to build on, 
although tackle Don Davey. first team all-Big 
Ten, is going to be missed The only returning 
starter on the kne is Lamark Shackeford 
There are three returning linebackers, howev- 
er, and inside backers Gary Casper and Bren- 
dan Lynch are gamers. Casper ted the team in 
tackles while Lynch has started the last 22 
games. Another stickout on the Badger de- 
fense is cornerback Troy Vincent. who broke 
up 10 passes in conference play and had a 
71-yard punt return far a touchdown against 
Michigan State Eddie Fletcher is back at the 
other corner Rafael Rabinson. who started at 
safety as a sophomore. returns after switching 
to tailback last year So the secondary ap- 
pears more than adequate. 

Field-goa! kicker Rich Thompson is deadly 
inside 40 yards (7-7) but was only 3-9 from 
long range Still he must he regarded as one 
of the Badgers’ more lethal weapons 

One thing that should help is the schedule 
Wisconsin drops Michigan and adds Purdue 
to its leage slate and all its nonleaque 
games--Western Illinois. lowa State, and 
Eastern Michigar--.are at home. It is conceiv- 
able, therefore. that the Badgers could win 
four games. even five, and that would be pro- 
gress by anyone’s measure

NOTRE DAME a 
(9-3) When his last football season for Notre 
Dame had ended, Raghib “Rocket” Ismail 
started competing in track meets. With a pow- 
erful offense and rebuilt defense. ail of Notre 
Dame's football games could resemble track 
meets this fall 

Despite los‘ng Ismail a year early to the 
pros. the Irish should be able to hang up some 
awesome point totals. Trouble is, their oppo- 
nents are likely to score some, too. Although 
coach Lou Holtz, who would find something to 
fret about in Paradise, says he has to rebuild 
his offensive line, the truth is he has three 
Quality starters retuming, along with a great 
blocking tight end. Derek Brown. Sure, he lost 
center Mike Heldt, but veteran staner Gene 
McGuire (6-5, 270) moves back there from 
tackle, bringing two years of experience at the 
position Guard Mirko Jurkovic (6-5, 281) and 
tackle Justin Hall (6-5, 295) also are on hand 
to ease Holtz’s mind. 

Even without the Rocket's red glare, Holtz 
can't complain about the rest of his offensive 
personnel He may even have found a Rocket 
lookalike in Chat Johnson, a former high

Move Dame 


STREET AMO SMITHS CCLLEGE FOOTBALL 


school quarterback who broke a 96-yard kick- 
off return in the spring game. Johnson runs a 
4.31 40 and carries the nickname “Cosmic.” 
Holtz concedes that though "he doesn't have 
Rocket speed, he has that same flair of reck- 
less abandon in running the ball.” Ismail 
aside, quarterback Rick Mirer will have ail of 
his other wide receivers back, including start- 
ing split end Tony Smith (15-229). Mirer made 
an impressive debut last year, leading the 
{rish to miracle finishes in his first two starts. 
He finished the season ranked ninth nationally 
in passing efficiency. Still, with as explosive a 
weapon at hand as the Rocket, Notre Dame 
was not really a passing team. Mirer threw for 
1,824 yards and eight touchdowns, good 
numbers but not out of the ordinary. Ismail 
caught only 32 passes for 699 yards. 

What the Irish do best—or at least the 
most—is run the football. And Holtz certainly 
does not lack for quality runners. With Rickey 
Watters gone, the starting tailback this fat! will 
be Rodney Culver, who switched over from 
fullback. Culver not only was the leading rush- 
ef last year (710 yards), but his 13 catches for 
145 yards ranked fourth-best on the squad. 


Holtz likes to use lots of runners, and in Willie 
Clark he may have found a good one to spell 
Culver. Clark, a safety last year, was a spring 
sensation, averaging seven yards a carry. He 
is fast enough to have beaten Ismail in a 200- 
meter sprint. Tony Brooks and Dorsey Levens 
also will be in the mix. Replacing Culver at 
fullback will be Jerome Bettis. 

Holtz might be forgiven for moaning about 
his defense, especially since it sometimes 
was none too dominating last year. The Irish 
have lost such standouts as nose tackle Chris 
Zorich, linebacker Mike Stonebreaker, and 
comerback Todd Lyght. All the other irish de- 
fensive backs return, but even with Lyght, 
they gave up 267 passing yards a game last 
year. Other than backs Rod Smith and Greg 
Davis, Notre Dame has just two starters re- 
turning on defense. One, fifth-year defensive 
tackle George Williams (6-3, 298), will anchor 
the line. Junior Bryant will replace Zorich and 
Bryant Young is the other down lineman. Only 
Demetrius DuBose returns at linebacker. Jim 
Flanagan replaces Stonebreaker inside and 
Devon McDonald and Anthony Peterson will 
patrol the outside. 

Though the names have changed, the qual- 
ity is likely to remain at about the same level.

The Irish have lost only four games in the last 
three seasons. With a somewhat easier 
schedule (Miami is not on it), the Irish are not 
likely to lose more than two this year. Their first 
four games are against Big Ten teams, includ- 
ing Indiana, Michigan, and Michigan State. If 
Notre Dame wins all four, Holtz can lobby to 
go to the Rose Bowl. 


YOUNGSTOWN STATE 

(11-1) Trivia question? What was the only Divi- 
sion I-A or I-AA leam to go 11-0 in the regular 
season last year? That's right, Youngstown 
State. The Penguins put the big chill on all 11 
regular-season opponents, including I-A foes 
Akron, Ohio U., and Eastem Michigan. They 
were the only I-AA team to defeat more than 
one I-A school. The Penguins were ranked 


No. 2 in the final NCAA poll. Then it all ended 
abruptly with a first-round 20-17 loss to Cen- 
tral Florida in the playoffs. 

With 16 returning starters, Jim Tressel can 
expect more of the same this fall. Starting his 
sixth year as head coach, Tressel has won 20 
of his last 23 games. He has his entire offen- 
sive line back, led by tackle Mike Simonsic (6- 
4, 280). And quarterback Ray Isaac will be 
starting for the third year. He was 98-185 for 
1,597 yards last year and threw only seven 
interceptions. He had 14 touchdown passes. 
Tressel does lose wide receiver, Ray Elling- 
ton, who caught 37 for 696 yards, but Andre 
Ballinger (19-374) is back. Leading rusher Ar- 
chie Herring (221-904) is gone and he will also 
be missed on kickoff returns, where he aver- 
aged 30.6 yards, second in the nation. Tam- 
ton Smith, who gained 485 yards on 77 carries 
(6.3 average), will replace Herring at tailback. 
One big find for Tressel last year was fresh- 
man kicker Jeff Wilkins, who led the team in 
scoring, with 86 points. 

On the other side of the ball the biggest loss 
was at nose tackle, where Tony Bowens was a 
|-AA All-America. The club's fourth-leading 
tackler, Bowens also was second in sacks. 
Pat Danko (5-10, 285). who started at tackle 
last year, moves to Bowens’s nose-guard 
spot. And there is still a load of talent on de- 
fense, starting with linebacker Kevin Brown, 
who led the team with six sacks for 45 yards, 
had three other tackles for loss, and recov- 
ered two fumbles. In the secondary Tressel 
welcomes back Derek Pixley, the Penguins’ 
leading tackler, and Dave Roberts, who had 
eight interceptions. 


This fall there are no I-A schools on the 
schedule, but that doesn't mean the Pen- 
guins, good as they are, can expect to waltz to 
another 11-0 season. Not when two-time de- 
fending I-AA champ Georgia Southem is wait- 
ing in Statesboro for a November showdown. 


NORTHERN ILLINOIS 
(6-5) in a smail way Charlie Sadler was re- 
sponsible for Northern Illinois’ winning the 
NCAA rushing championship last year. This 
year Sadler will be fully responsible for every- 
thing the Huskies do. Two days after Christ- 
mas Sadler became Northem’s coach when 
Jerry Pettibone left to coach at Oregon State. 
Before that Sadler had been defensive co- 
ordinator at Oklahoma. It was while directing 
the Sooners’ defense last fall that Sacler indi- 
rectly helped the Huskies salvage something 
from a season that had gone sour. When Okla- 
homa held Nebraska to just 118 yards rushing 
in the Cornhuskers’ final game. it catapulted 
NIU, with its 344.6 yards per game average, 
into first place in the NCAA stats. Oddly, that 
was not the high point of the season for a team 
that had been hoping to go bowling but ended 
up barely above .500. Because one of North- 
ems six victories was an extraordinary 73-18 
pounding of a Fresno State team that went into 
the game unbeaten and nationally ranked. 
Unfortunately for Sadler. the Huskies open 
the 1991 campaign at Fresno State. This time, 
Northern Illinois will not have quarterback Sta- 
cey Robinson, who ran for 308 yards and five 


touchdowns that day. Robinson is one of 17 

departed starters who have left the cupboard 

nearly bare for the new coach. But Sadler 

does not appear to be daunted. A long-time 

assistant coach, he felt he was ready to make 

the big step to a head job. “The knowledge 

that this program is on the move was impor. . 
tant,” he said. 

To keep it on the move, Sadler has made 
changes. He's replaced Pettibone’s wishbone 
offense with the multipie-|, which also features 
the running game. “We intend to throw the ball 
20 times a game.” he said. “It’s not going to 
be Air Huskie or anything. We're going to run 
the football.” There's little doubt who will do 
most of the running. One of only two returning 
starters on offense is fullback Adam Dach, 
who gained 966 yards last year and needs 
1,155 to break Mark Kellar’s school record 
(3.745). Replacing Robinson at quarterback 
will be either another Stacey, Stacey McKin- 
ney. a transfer from California’s Taft college. 


STREET AND SMITHS COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


or Rob Rugai last year’s backup. Rugai is a 
better thrower, McKinney a better runner. 

Defensively, Sadler has gone from a 4-4 toa 
5-2 alignment. Of the five retuming starters, 
inside linebacker Steve Henriksen has the 
most impressive credentials. With 153 tackles 
last year, he is the fourth-leading returning 
tackler in the country. 

One of Sadler's tougher tasks will be re- 
placing kicker John Ivanic, the schoo!'s all- 
time leading scorer. 


CINCINNATI 

(1-10) The Bearcats should change their 
names to the Vagabonds. Once again Cincin- 
nati will hit the road for six of its first seven 
games. So don't expect any dramatic im- 
provement in the won-loss record. But there 
could be considerable improvement in the 
product that Tim Murphy puts on the field in 
his third season as coach. Murphy returns 10 
starters on offense and eight on defense from 
a team that at times played respectably last 
year. Of course there were other times when 
the Bearcats were way beyond their depth. 


They were routed 63-10 at lowa and 70-21 at 
Florida State. There are some big names on 
this year's schedule, too, beginning with the 
opener at Penn State. 

Cincinnati is probably another year away 
from respectability, but if Bearcat fans have 
patience, they may yet be rewarded. Quarter- 
back Paul Anderson and most of his top re- 
ceivers were redshirt freshmen last year. An- 
derson threw for more than 200 yards three 
times and also is a good runner. He is backed 
up by another sophomore, Jeff Stofa, son of 
former NFL quarterback John Stofa. Jeff fell 
behind when he missed spring practice last 
year but started two games when Anderson 
was hurt. Tight end Joe Koynock was the 
leading target last year with 44 catches and 
496 yards. He’s back along with young wide 
receivers Marlon Pearce and Damon Bryant. 
who were second and third in receptions. The 
lone absentee on offense is tailback Terry 
Strong, who gained 803 yards and was the 
only Bearcat runner to gain more than 200. 
But Murphy is hoping that little (5-6) Joe 
Abrams has finally recovered from the 1989 
injury that has hobbied him after a. brilliant 
freshman start. For the second year in a row 
the offensive line returns intact, anchored by 
left guard John Arena (6-3, 280). This senior- 
dominated unit is the team’s top asset. 

Another strength is the secondary, where 
cornerbacks Kelly Sims and Ronnie Shannon 


78 


retum for their fourth season as starters. Shan- 
non, however, will switch to free safety, giving 
sophomore Jocelyn Borgella a chance to start 
at corner. Johnathan Cockrell returns at 
strong safety, backed up by sophomore Lat- 
ish Kinsler, who started four games there 
when Cockrell was hurt. Both outside line- 
backers, Nate Dingle and Andre Sherrod, re- 
turn but inside linebacker is wide-open. Nase- 
guard Bob Duckens returns, as does tackle 
Ronnie Dixon, but the defense against the run 
(opponents romped for 3,160 yards) was 
hardly sterling last year. 


AKRON 
(3-7-1) The Zips lost their final seven games 
last year, but except for an expected 59-0 
licking at Florida and a season-ending 36-15 
loss at Louisiana Tech, Gerry Faust’s team 
was in every game. Five defeats by five points 
or less separated Akron from a fine season. 

But 1991 could be a trying season for the 
Zips, who lost most of their defense, including 
linebackers Brian Hilk and John Clark. who 
totaled 328 tackles, and the entire secondary, 
which intercepted 16 passes. Defensive coor- 
dinator Bob Junko will begin the rebuilding 
process around nose guard Wayne Ander- 
son, who started as a freshman last year. The 
only other returning starters are end Eric 
Drakes and linebacker Bruce Keys. “The de- 
fense is definitely a concern when you lose the 
quality players that we had,” said Faust, “but! 
think we have some terriffic kids just waiting to 
get their turn.” 

The defensive players with the most experi- 
ence are linebacker Jerry Best. who started 
against Rutgers and had two sacks and three 
other tackles for loss during the season, and 
Doug Sumler, who had four starts at end and 
linebacker last year. Best is expected to start 
at outside linebacker, with Sumler playing an 
interior fine position. Mike Orbovich, who was 
a tight end last year, moves to linebacker.

Offensively, Faust is hoping quarterback 
Jeff Sweitzer is in full health after he injured his 
shoulder in the Florida game. Sweitzer set a 
school record when he passed for 339 yards 
against Youngstown State. His completion 
percentage was not good (.468) and he threw 
10 interceptions to only seven touchdowns, 
but he was the fourth-leading rusher on the 
team, with 322 yards. Top runner Marcus Reli- 
ford (177-684) left school after running afoul of 
the law, leaving Faust with no experienced 
tailbacks. Fullback Tyrone Nelson, who aver- 
aged five yards per Carry, does return, howev- 
er. The two top wide receivers, Bradford 
Jones (17-221) and Harold Robinson (16- 
359), return. but if the Orbovich experiment at 


linebacker sticks, Faust will need a new tight 
end. Orbovich tied Jones for the team lead 
with his 17 catches. One big plus for the Zips 
is the offensive line, which retums four start- 
ers, including junior tackle Chris Sutyak, who 
is big (6-7, 290), quick, and a potential star. 
Brett Jackson has started 33 games in a row 
at guard and Mike O'Connor started all 11 
games at center last year after being a start- 
ing left guard the two previous years

WESTERN MICHIGAN 

\f onty because of the law of averages, West- 
esn Michigan should improve on its 7-4 re- 
cord. The Broncos lost two league games by a 
touchdown or fess and the prior season 
dropped four games by one point. 

Fifth-year coach Al Molde will build around 
all-MAC running back Corey Syive, who aver- 
aged 5.7 yards a carry en route to an 840-yard 
season. Quarterback Brad Tayles ted the con- 
ference in total offense while completing 171 
of 345 passes for 2.397 yards and 16 touch- 
downs. He has an abundance of receivers, 
led by Ulric King, Lavelle VanHorn, and Rob- 
ert Walker. Molde says 6-6, 330-pound junior 
Paul Hutchins is “the best offensive line pros- 
pect I've had." Hutchins helped Western 
Michigan average 400 yards per game, best 
in the MAC. Center Jon Manier was he'd out of 
spring drills with a back injury that could end 
his career, but the line could include a pair of 
280-pounders, Bob Wolf and Dan Shannon 
Dave VanDale, who missed five games with 
an injury, should start at guard or center. 

The defensive line is solid with Mark Na- 
bozny and Pau! Johnson as third-year starters 
and Dave Cutlip as another incumbent. The 
linebacking corps features Jeff Allor, Greg 
Kelley, and Darrius Griffith; Eric West and Jeff 
Reynolds retum in the secondary. Former 
starter Paul Davis is back after missing the ‘90 
season with a shoulder injury. 


CENTRAL MICHIGAN 
The Chippewas must replace defensive tack- 
le J.J. Wierenga, linebacker Rich Curtiss, and 
Gefensive backs Ken Strong and David John- 
son, each an all-MAC selection. Fullback Joe 
Connolly, a second-team pick, also gracuated. 
“Obviously, we have some question marks on 
the defensive side of the ball,” coach Herb 
Oeromedi admitted. “We have to rebuild the 
secondary entirely.” 

Only cornerback James Cooper remains in 
the defensive backfield but Central Michigan 
claims veterans Mike Nettie and Lamar Sally 


STREET AMD SMITH S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


in the line and has linebackers Clarence Rose 
and Kevin Rich as returning regulars. Jason 
Wilkie earned second-team all-MAC laurels at 
nose guard. The Chippewas led the nation in 
scoring defense (8.9 ppg) and topped the 
MAC in rushing defense (99.7 yards). 
Quarterback Jeff Bender, the league's 
MVP, anchors a veteran offense that includes 
flanker Ken Ealy, who caught 44 passes for 
916 yards and nine touchdowns, including 
three TD passes from Bender in the Raisin 
Bowl. Tailback Billy Smith ran for 1,047 yards 
and guard Paul Jacobson earned all-confer- 
ence honors. Central Michigan set the stan- 
dard for a balanced offense, gaining 2,113 
yards via the ground and 2,112 through the 
air. The line also includes veterans Art Droski, 
Tony Vais, James Wyatt, and Greg Sherwin. 


TOLEDO 

The Rockets became a hot item in Toledo by 
drawing an average of 22,821 fans per game, 
which was second-best in MAC history. A 9-2 
. season came within seven points of being a 
perfect one as Navy beat Toledo by four and 
Central Michigan won by a point. 

New coach Gary Pinkel has a strong of- 
fense built around quarterback Keven Meger 
and tailback Troy Parker, the MAC Freshman 
of the Year. The line features Joe DiLauro, 
Andy McCollum, and Albert Thigpen. David 
Andrews and Ben Tombaugh give Toledo 
punch at fullback and Marcus Goodwin is the 
most experienced receiver. Pinkel must re- 
place three linemen and two receivers. 

The defense keeps five starters: linebacker 
Matt Eberflus, who had 89 tackles; end Dan 
Williams, who had 17 tackles for losses; cor- 
nerbacks Jason Kelley and Darren Anderson, 
and end Mark Rhea. 

Punter Brian Borders (40.8-yard average} 
and Rusty Hanna (18 field goals) assure the 
Rockets of a strong kicking game. 


MIAMI 
The Redskins seek to improve on their 5-5-1 
record by building around a defense with nine 
returning starters. Miami led the league in 
pass defense and was third in total defense. 
After a winless season in 1988, Miami began 
to rebuild under first-year coach Randy Walk- 
er, who guided the team to a 4-3-1 mark in the 
MAC. He is blessed with an All-America can- 
didale. defensive end Jon Wauford, who had 
22 tackles for losses. The return of tackles 
Scott Frazier, who also made 22 tackles for 
losses, and Mark Staten and end Andy How- 
ard convinces Walker his defense will be even 
better. Linebackers Curt McMillen and Barry 
Renfro were among league leaders in tackles 
and free safety Ron Carpenter led the league 
with seven interceptions. Shean Williams and 
Cajardo Lindsey also return to the secondary. 
Multi-purpose receiver Milt Stegall leads an 
offense that includes tailback Terry Carter and 
quarterback Jim Clement. Carter ran for 250 
yards against Ohio and Stegall returned 
a kickoff 92 yards for a TD vs. Toledo. 


BALL STATE 

The loss of Bernie Parmalee, who had a team- 
leading 30 receptions and 1,010 yards rush- 
ing, will be felt heavily by the Cardinals. Corey 
Croom, Ball State’s second-leading rusher 
(398 yards), is still around and Mike LeSure 
and Travis Moore give the Cards some deep 
receiving threats. Quarterback Mike Neu 


STREET AND SMITH’S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


completed 91 of 180 passes for 1,004 yards, 
yet Ball State finished next to last in total of- 
fense and passing offense. 

But the Cardinals were second nationally in 
total defense and No. 2 in the MAC both in 
rushing and passing defense. Opponents av- 
eraged only 3.5 yards per play. Keith Hackett 
and Leo Porter return for their fourth seasons 
in the Cardinals’ secondary and Robert Glov- 
er is back after making five interceptions in 
‘90. Don Stonefield’s 123 tackles ranked 
fourth in the league. 

Bail State won four straight and five of its 
last six in '90 for a 7-4 record. 


BOWLING GREEN 

Former Ohio State assistant Gary Blackney 
takes over the Falcons, who went 3-5-2 under 
Moe Ankney last season. Blackney will build 
around a defense that keeps eight starters 
and 18 lettermen. Gone are linebackers Keith 
Pace and Duane Crenshaw, but lineman 
Steve Ross is the only other loss from a unit 
that was 15th nationally in scoring defense. 
Standouts include strong safety Terry Wilson, 
who was second on the team with 104 tackles 
and had four interceptions. He is paired with 
Dave Bielinski, who had nine of the team’s 17 
interceptions. The defensive line features all- 
MAC nose guard Mark Ross, and a deep con- 
tingent at tackle is led by Steve Wilbourne and 
Paul Harris. “We hope the defense will be able 
to buy some time for the offense to come 
around,” Blackney said. 

After several productive seasons, Bowling 
Green averaged only 13 points a game. The 
offense retains quarterback Erik White and re- 
ceiver Mark Szlachcic, who had 46 catches. 
George Johnson, LeRoy Smith, and Zeb Jack- 
son provide depth at tailback but fullback is 
open. Tackle Nick Sims will move from center 
to tackle and Matt Kregel is returning from a 
knee injury that forced him to miss last sea- 
son. Brian Laird, Pete Kowalski and Pat Dut- 
son will also be in the line 


EASTERN MICHIGAN 

Jim Harkema’s successful rebuilding pro- 
gram suffered a 2-9 setback after posing the 
MAC's best record over the previous three 
seasons. The Hurons will try to bounce back 
against a tougher schedule that includes 
games against Big Ten schools Purdue and 
Wisconsin. Eastern Michigan won its first two 
games in '90 and then skidded into an eighth- 
place finish. “It was a real disappointment to 
us because we felt going into the year that we 
had a chance to challenge for the title,” Har- 
kema said. . 

The Hurons lost an outstanding safety, Bob 
Navarro, and three starting defensive linemen 
in Mike Bass, Craig Petersmark, and Donshell 
English. Returning starters are outside line- 
backers Fred McClendon and Derrick Buford, 
inside linebacker Mike Danley, and defensive 
backs Werner Blakely and Kevin Tooson. 

Quarterback Shane Jackson must cut back 
on his 14 interceptions. The departure of cen- 
ter Gordie Johnston and tackle Steve Brockel- 
bank will be felt but Ken Moss, a 340-pound 
tackle, and Bobby Pandelidis, a 284-pound 
guard, remain. Tailback Cameron Moss and 
split end Rodney Screen return. 


KENT STATE 
New coach Pete Cordelli won't face an empty 
cupboard because the Golden Flashes keep 


10 starters on offense and nine on defense 
from a 2-9 squad. And his first game as a 
college head coach will be on his birthday, 
September 14, against his alma mater, North 
Carolina State. 

Kent State returns five of its top six tacklers. 
Brian Allen, Vance Benton, and Paul Haynes 
(133 stops), started in the secondary. Line- 
backers include Sean Patterson, Brady Ren- 
ners, and Maurice Sumpter; the line is built 
around Andy Krupa and Dave Tkatch. 

Doug Agnew made a successful switch 
from defense to the offensive line last season 
and North Carolina trahsfer David Boon had a 
good season at guard. Split end Patrick Young 
was Kent State’s only loss on offense, where 
Tony Gucciardo had 29 catches and Shawn 
Barnes 28. Quarterback Joe Dalpra threw for 
1,533 yards and 10 touchdowns and ran for 
403 yards and five more scores. The Golden 
Flashes averaged 10 more points per game 
than they did in 1989. 


OHIO 

Second-year coach Tom Lichtenberg says his 
team will be bigger, faster, and stronger. But 
after going 1-7-1, the real question is whether 
the Bobcats will be better. 

Ohio will be especially green on defense, 
where eight regulars departed. Linebacker 
Scott Zele anchors that unit and Randy Raw- 
lins and Marcus Gamblin strengthen the sec- 
ondary. John Browne and Tony Greene head 
a youthful line that could include, 250-pound 
Greg Cox, a former quarterback. 

The current quarterback is Tom Dubs, a 
sophomore who has thrown but 21 collegiate 
passes. He replaces Anthony Thornton, the 
school’s second-leading career passer. Rick- 
ey Howell, Aubrey Bell, and Tim Curtis all have 
experience at running back, combining to 
rush for nearly 1,200 yards in '90. Courtney 
Burton had 20 receptions, but the Bobcats 
lost four of their receivers. Dal Leisenheimer 
should be a standout at center and the guard 
tandem of Darren Reese and Scott Tate is in- 
tact. Chris Park, Andy Canter, and Keith Shep- 
herd will see the time at tackle.

EASTERN KENTUCKY 

Tailback Tim Lester ran for 1,047 yards and 12 
touchdowns after coming back from a knee 
injury that sidelined him most of the 1989 sea- 
son. Veteran coach Roy Kidd also has 245- 
pound fullback Rick Burkhead and tailbacks 
Markus Thomas and Leon Brown, who com- 
bined to rush for more than 1,500 yards. Quar- 
terback Joey Crenshaw started the last four 
games and completed 49 of 86 passes. He 
will throw to wide receivers Vincent Ware and 
Kenny McCollum and tight end Dwayne 
Woods. Carl Satterly and Tim Wimbley are the 
only returning regulars in the line, although 
Mike Roth started several games. 

The defense claims eight starters, including 
Ail-America nose guard Ernest Thompson. 
Other all-OVC players on defense are end Da- 
vid Wilkins, tackle Greg McKee, and safety 
Craig Brooks. Linebacker Bundy McGinnis 
and backs Tim Payton, Chris McNamee, and 
Glen Williams also return. 

The Colonels, two-time national champions, 
won their first 10 games a year ago and held 
the No. 1 ranking much of that time. But after 


79 


an injury to quarterback Lorenzo Fields, they 
lost their season finale to Morehead State and 
dropped their playoff opener. 


MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE 

Coach Boots Donnelly, who can warble the 
blues with the best of them, is bemoaning the 
departure of 16 starters from a club ranked 
No. 1 in the final regular-season poll. The Biue 
Raiders lost a quarterfinal game to Boise State 
in the I-AA playoffs. 

Injuries to two quarterbacks slowed Middie 
Tennessee State in ‘80 and the situation re- 
mains unresolved. Phil Ironside, an all-OVC 
selection, has graduated and backup O.J. 
Smith missed spring drills with a knee injury. 
Another backup, Dino Stafford, missed con- 
tact drills while recovering from eye surgery. 
Middie Tennessee needs a quarterback to 
take pressure off tailback Joe Campbell, a 
1,327-yard rusher. The loss of stellar fullback 
Wade Johnson also hurts. But the line still has 
285-pound tackle Steve McAdoo, centers 
Mike Gibson and Tracy Majors, guard Chris 
Smith, and tight end Steve Dark. 

Losses on defense include linebacker An- 
thony Coleman, the OVC Defensive Player of 
the Year in 89; Richard Kinley, Kelvin Robin- 
son, Mike Fairbanks, Greg Pollard, and Jimmy 
McCamey, the '80 OVC Defensive Player of 
the Year. Linebacker Scott Boykin and back 
Jamie Redmond are veteran returnees. 


TENNESSEE STATE 

Joe Gilliam's second year as the Tigers’ head 
coach produced a 7-4 record and a 4-2 mark 
in the league. Gilliam keeps 14 starters, in- 
cluding premier wide receivers Marcus Dow- 
dell and Patrick Robinson. Dowdell had 28 
receptions for 672 yards; his 24-yard-per- 
catch average led Division I-AA. Robinson, a 


Starting point guard for Tennessee State's - 


basketball team, had 39 catches for 714 
yards and gained 18.3 per catch. The Tigers’ 
passing was done by James Wade, who com- 
pleted 51 percent of 247 attempts for 2,052 
yards and 16 touchdowns. Tennessee State 
lost two good runners in Tim Cross and James 
Reese, the latter opting not to return for his 
final season of eligibility. The offensive line is 
led by Larry Tharpe, a 265-pound tackle, and 
285-pound center John Macon. 

Colin Godfrey had the second-best punting 
average in I-AA history, 45.9, but the lass of 
place-kicker J.J. Flournoy will be noticed. He 
converted 47 of 49 extra points and 15 of 17 
field goals over two seasons. Bernard Wilson, 
Elliott Pilton, and Oarrell Brooks are experi- 
enced linemen. Linebackers include Aaron 
Luckey, Simon Shanks, and Darrell Miller; 
Randy Fuller anchors the secondary. 


MOREHEAD STATE 
The Eagles’ tosses include only three starters 
on defense and four on offense, but the de- 
parture of quarterback Chris Swartz provides 
a stiff challenge for second-year coach Cole 
Proctor. Swartz teft Morehead State wth 16 
school (this is Phil Simms’s aima mater, 
remember), 10 conference, and two national 
records. He threw for 9,028 yards and 55 
touchdowns. Proctor also lost tailback Jerome 
Williams and wide receiver Dave Pingue. 
While their record was only 5-6, the Eagles 
ended their season with victories over Murray 
State and Eastern Kentucky, the latter an 
archrival that was ranked No. 1 at the time. 


80 


Morehead State’s strength is defense, where 
tackle Richard Shadwick, outside linebacker 
Fred Johnson, and cormerbacks Tyran Fisher 
and Carlos Tuck reign. The offense is led by 
tackle James Appel, tight end Brandon Ferd. 
and wide receiver Anthony White, who also 
returns kicks. Spring practice failed to provide 
a cut-and-dried successor for Swartz. Jeremy 
Holbrook played some as a true freshman and 
may have a slight edge on Steve Donato. Jeff 
King and Yusif Gray will be considered. The 
tunning backs are Anthony Jerdine and Darrin 
Harris, backups in 1990, and Roscoe Graves 
and Frank Diaz, who didn't play last season. 


SOUTHEAST MISSOURI STATE 
The Indians’ only game against an OVC 
school last season was a 45-0 defeat by East- 
em Kentucky. But Southeast Missouri claims 
eight returning starters on defense and seven 
on offense from a 7-3 team. 

Jason Liley completed 61 percent of his 
passes for 2,580 yards as a sophomore but he 
threw 19 interceptions. Ches Salyer had 58 


catches for 817 yards and Darrell Philon had 
51 for 717. Perry Johnson is established at 
running back and Bryan Davis at fullback. The 
offensive line keeps only tackles Mike Hodge 
and Shawn Corbett. 

Coach John Mumford has a veteran sec- 
ondary boasting James Chinn, Francis Ward, 
Ramon McClenney, and Toney Anderson. in- 
side linebackers Sean Steinmann and Nate 
Questelle were starters, but there are open- 
ings at outside linebacker. 

“We have the skilled athletes to be competi- 
tive at the I-AA level, but I'm concemed with 
our size and depth up front,” said Mumford, 
whose club moves up from Division II. “We 
must learn to play at the I-AA level and to play 
tougher both mentally and physically.” 


MURRAY STATE 

Murray State’s 2-9 record was uncharacteris- 
tic of the Racers, who lost seven straight be- 
fore closing with a victory over Austin Peay. 
Murray retains six starters on offense and de- 
fense but fifth-year coach Mike Mahoney is 
looking for help fram new players. “Every ju- 
nior-college kid we've recruited we expect to 
come in and either start or see quite a bit of 
playing time,” he said. 


Mahoney must settle on either Kevin Proc- 
tor, a five-game starter, or junior-college 
transfer Tremaine Lewis as quarterback. Tail- 
back will be contested between Chris Sypho 
and Tim Bland and David Cox has the edge at 
fullback. Rick Miller is the Racers’ best wide 
receiver and Matt Havilil and Kris Minnich look 
strong at tight end. Veterans in the offensive 
line are Greg Armstrong, Steve Broughton, 
Marcus Perry, and Norman Mims. 

The defensive line is deep with Craig Hob- 
son, Scott Cannon, and Kevin Gibbs return- 
ing, but Jimmy Stratton is the only linebacker 
who lettered. Experience in the secondary 
comes from William Houston, Beau Brown, 
Mike Ramos, and Tyrone Young 


TENNESSEE TECH 

Jim Ragland continued his tedious rebuilding 
program. His inaugural team went 0-10 in 
1986 and improved to 5-6 before injuries 
brought on a 1-10 slate in 88. But Tennessee 
Tech followed with 5-5 in ‘89 and 6-5 a year 
ago, its first winning record since 1981. There 
are 15 retuming starters. 

The Golden Eagles’ biggest problem will be 
replacing quarterback Bert Browne, who 
completed 52 percent of his passes for 2.050 
yards and 14 touchdowns. His understudy. 
Damyen Taylor, got into seven games and 
completed 24 of 39 attempts and is a much 
better runner than Browne. Redshirt freshman 
Randy Beaman also looked good in spring 
practice. Fred Lowery and Atonzo Hamilton 
shared time at tailback and combined to rush 
for 790 yards. Tech lost fullback John Webb 
but keeps Bill Shackelford. a 339-yard pro- 
ducer. Marshal! Hale looms as one of the 
OVC's best receivers after having 690 yards 
in receptions. Carios James will anchor the 
offensive line. 

Ragland keeps nine defensive starters, led 
by rover Felix Parham. Linebacker Tim Ford 
topped the Golden Eagles in tackles. Norman 
Orake and Shane Queen !end experience at 
end and Mike Stewart and George Thompson 
tatum in the secondary. 


AUSTIN PEAY 

Roy Gregory wiil be the Governors’ third 
coach in three years and faces the formidable 
task of rebuilding a team that went 0-11 each 
of the past two seasons. “What happened last 
year was last year,” said Gregory, who has 16 
teturning starters. Gregory believes he built 
some confidence during spnng practices. 
"The players are starting to believe in them- 
selves and each other.” he said, stealing a 
line from the movie Hoosiers. 

Incumbent quarterback Reggie Willams is 
being challenged by sophomore Kailik Hunt- 
ef, and they could benefit from the switch ci 
free safety Eric Wells to wide receiver. Run- 
ning back Eric Dance led the Governors in 
fushing despite several injuries and will be 
backed up by Jamie Spicer. Former defensive 
linemen Eric Cross and Tyier Ray also have 
been moved to offense and Gregory likes the 
look of former tight end Richard Darden at 
Gefensive end. “We have to get our best ath- 
letes on the field in positions where they can 
best help the football team,” Gregory said. 

Austin Peay will lack depth but should be 
solid at linebacker with Bobby Boddie and 
Randy Murphree. Jeff Crutchfield heads the 
defensive line and James Mesicor and Darius 
Willis anchor the secondary.

SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER 


It happens once every two or three de- 
cades. In the late 1960s, the Los Angeles 
area had a pair of Heisman Trophy candi- 
dates in quarterback Gary Beban of UCLA 
and tailback O.J. Simpson of USC (both went 
on to win the award). Now it’s the San Francis- 
co Bay Area's turn. 

Junior running backs Glyn Milburn of Stan- 
ford and Russell White of California haven't 
had the national attention that surrounded Be- 
ban and Simpson, but it’s coming. No doubt 
about that. Not after a special 1990 season for 
both that culminated in a remarkable show in 
the season finale, the Cal-Stanford Big Game. 
Milburn and White ran. They caught passes. 
They returned kickoffs. Milburn returned a 
punt. When it was over, when Stanford had 
somehow scrambled to a 27~25 victory, Mil- 
burn had rushed for 196 yards and a touch- 
down, White for 177 yards and two TDs. Mil- 
burn had 379 all-purpose yards, White 268. 

It was nothing new. For the season, tailback 
White gained an even 1,000 yards, averaging 
5.6 a carry, even though he shared time with 
Anthony Wallace. He became the only player 
in Pac-10 history ever to earn all-conference 
first-team honors despite not being a starter. 
He was also No.7 in NCAA all-purpose run- 
ning with 159.6 yards per game. 

Halfback Milburn led the nation in all-pur- 
pose yards, with 2,222, an average of 202 a 
game and the second-highest total in Pac-10 
history. He rushed for 729 yards, caught a 
league-best 64 passes for 632 yards, re- 
turned 24 punts for 267 yards, and had 594 
yards in kickoff returns. 

“In one season,” said Stanford coach Den- 
nis Green, "Glyn has established himself as 
the finest all-around threat in college football. 
He is a jack-of-all-trades and has the charac- 
teristics to master them all.” 

Milburn is a little guy, just 5-foot-9 and 175 
pounds, while White is 6-0 and a relatively 
hefty 200 pounds. But both have speed and 
shiftiness to burn. Despite his size, White runs 
a 4.4 40, so he can pretty much choose 
whether he wants to go around defenders or 
through them. Coach Bruce Snyder thinks his 
best run last season was a one-yarder against 
USC. “It was fourth and one,” Snyder said. 
“Russell hit the hole and there was nothing 
there. He bounced off, broke a tackle, pushed 
through and just made it. It was a great run.” 

Milburn also can be a tough and willing in- 
side runner. “I've always been the smallest 
guy on every team I've been on," he says, 
“but I've always been the fastest guy, too.” 

Milburn and White were both California high 
school stars. His senior season at Santa Moni- 
ca High, Milburn ran for an incredible 2,718 
yards, a state single-season record. And at 
Crespi High School in Van Nuys, White rushed 
for 5,998 career yards and scored 94 touch- 
downs, both California prep records. But nei- 
ther man followed a direct route to college 
football fame. 


81 


White, nephew of Heisman Trophy winner 
Charles White, has dyslexia, a learning disor- 
der, and had te sit out his freshman year at Cal 
to get his grades in shape. Milburn, cousin of 
Rod Milburn, the 1972 Olympic gold medalist 
in the 110-meter high hurdles, began his col- 
lege career at Oklahoma, and had to sit out a 
season after transferring. | wanted to make 
Oklahoma a positive experience, but | felt | 
made a mistake going there,” he said. “I kept 
thinking of ways to get to Stanford.” The col- 
lege football world seems to await both young 
runners, who will due! for local, regional, and 
national attention. 

Both, it would seem, have plenty of room to 
improve, but White is a shade less well-devel- 
oped, because the Cal coaches decided to 
have him split time last season. Now, Bears’ 
offensive coordinator Steve Mariucci says, 
“Russell has a chance to be the best back in 
college football. We just have to get him the 
football.” That will suit White just fine. He says 
his best runs are still to come. “t still don’t think 
I've hit the peak | had in high schoo!,” he says, 
“and | felt so confident that | could do any- 
thing. But that confidence is coming back. I'm 
getting used to it.” 


82 


Despite their brilliance, it's doubtful that ei- 
ther Milburn or White can lead his team to a 
Pac-10 title. Washington looks tco good, al- 
though its prospects dimmed a little on both a 
conference and a national fevel when quarter- 
back Mark Brunell hurt a knee in the spring. 
But Don James's squad absolutely hammered 
every conference opponent except UCLA last 
season, and still has plenty of weapons. Larry 
Smith should have another good—if young— 
team at USC, while now-and-future quarter- 
back star Tommy Maddox was not only good 
enough to upset Washington last season, but 
appears good enough to lead a renaissance 
at once-beleaguered UCLA. Cal has a lot of 
offense but needs more defense. Stanford 
again looks to have too many pitfalls in its 
schedule, which includes Washington, Colo- 
rado, and Notre Dame early. Proven coaches

WASHINGTON ———— 
Oon James got the message a few seasons 
ago. He needed more team speed. The rest of 
the nation got the message last season. He 
found that speed, and nearly parlayed it into 
the No. 1 ranking in the country. As it was, the 
Huskies were 10-2 overall, 7-1 in the Pac-10 
(where they outscored the rest of the league. 
340-95), won the Rose Bowl, and finished fifth 
in the final wire-service polls. Some thought 
they were the best in the nation at the end of 
the season. Others compared them with the 


great Southern Cal teams of John McKay in 
the 1960s and ‘70s. 

There are some important ingredients miss- 
ing from the 1890 James Gang, notably pre- 
mier running back Greg Lewis. defensive line- 
man Travis Richardson, and cornerback 
Charles Mincy. Junior quanerback Mark Brun- 
ell, who passed for 1,732 yards and ran for 
444, second-best on the club, underwent 
knee surgery after a spring-practice injury 
and may be out for the season. 

Brunell’s loss elevated sophomore Billy Joe 
Hobert, who is big (6-3, 225) and strong but 
has played only briefly, into the key offensive 
role. He has a talented supporting cast. be-

returns Dana Hall, William Doctor, and Walter 
Bailey at cornerback, Shane Pahukoa and 
Tommie Smith at free safety, and Paxton Tai- 
lele at rover. 

Either Mike Dodd or Travis Hanson, who 
shared the job, will be the place-kicker, with 
Hobernt likely to take over for punter Channing 
Wyles, although Hanson could push him. 

All in all, it's another potent mix, even minus 
Brunell, and James knows it. He aiso knows 
the pressure his team will face. “You use the 
positive part of that as motivation to try to 
move to another level,” he said. “You are con- 
tinually aware that you become a bigger tar- 
get. We've been one for the last 10 or 12 
years. But we're going to be an even bigger 
one this year." 


SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
Larry Smith doesn't mince words: "In some 
areas we're stronger than last year, and in 
others we won't be as strong. But we'll be a 
contender for the Pac-10 championship.” He 
has some preity compelling numbers to sup- 
port his case. The Trojans fielded their least 
experienced team in 25 years last season 
{only seven returning starters) and played one 
of their toughest schedules (eight bowl-bound 
teams were on it). Yet they still finished 8-4-1 
overail and 5-2-1 and in second place in the 
conference, and were ranked 20th by AP and 
22nd by UPI. 

In place of always-controversial Todd Mar- 
inovich, who took an early out to the pros, 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


Smith may alternate sophomores Reggie Per- 
ry and Curtis Conway at quarterback. Perry 
has taken just three varsity snaps but seems 
to be in the Rodney Peete mold. Conway is an 
erstwhile flanker bul was very impressive as a 
quarterback in the spring. They'll have plenty 
of help from tailback Mazio Royster, an All- 
America candidate who gained 1,168 yards 
as a sophomore, and underrated senior full- 
back Scott Lockwood (534 yards rushing). 
Also back is split end Johnnie Morton, with 
Travis Hannah or redshirt freshman John Her- 
pin trying to replace Gary Wellman (1,015 
yards receiving) at flanker. 

The offensive line loses Pat Harlow and 
Mark Tucker but may have the best weakside 
blocking duo in the nation in senior tackle Mi- 
chael Moody (6-7, 285) and senior guard Der- 
tick Deese. Sophomore Craig Gibson, who 
Started the last seven games at center, is 
back, too. There is youth at the other two inte- 
rior spots. Among the candidates are sopho- 
more David Apolskis and Titus Tuiasosopo, 
Kian Ramsay, and Michael Gaytan. Three 
players who have starting experience—Yon- 
nie Jackson, Bradford Banta, and Bob 
Crane—are vying at tight end. 

Five starters return from a defense that was 
No. 16 nationally against the run. Three of 
them—junior safety Stephon Pace, who had 
76 tackles, a team-high 20 deflections and 
four interceptions, and cornerbacks Calvin 
Holmes and Jason Oliver—are in the second- 
ary. The others are sophomore tackle Terry 
McDaniels and senior outside linebacker Kurt 
Barber, who had a team-high 84 tackles and 
was an all-Pac-10 second-teamer. 

Matt Willig and sophomore Mike Hinz 
should move into the line spots vacated by 


Don Gibson and Gene Fruge. It may be tough- . | 


er to replace inside linebackers Scott Ross, 
an All-America, and Brian Tuliau. The likely 
candidates are Matt Gee and sophomore Gi- 
dion “Batman” Murrell, both of whom have 
experience, with sophomore Willie McGinest 
or David Webb in place of Craig Hartsuyker 
outside. Either sophomore Mike Salmon, a 
big-play type, or Marvin Pollard should get the 
fourth spot in the secondary, occupied last 
season by Marcus Hopkins. 

Punter Ron Dale (40.9-yard average on 59 
kicks) is back, but Smith is looking for some- 


one to take over for place-kicker Quinn Rodri- 
guez, who rewrote the Trojan field-goal and 
PAT records. Incoming freshman Cole Ford 
will contest sophomore walk-on Andy Norell. 
Much of the Trojans’ success this season 
will depend on the new quarterback, but how- 
ever the playing lime breaks down, Smith may 
be happier than he was with the position last 
season, because Marinovich--who had obvi- 
ous talent—was far from a picture of stability. 
“Last year we played inconsistent football,” 
Smith said. “We have a lot to make up for.” 


UCLA 
And a kid quarterback shall lead them. Tall, 
poised Tommy Maddox earned All-America 
honorable mention in 1990, was a first-team 
freshman All-America, and one of 10 finalists 
for the Davey O'Brien national quarterback 
award after finishing second in the Pac-10 
and 20th nationally in passing efficiency. Little 
wonder that the Bruins took a major step to- 
ward the country’s elite and denied Washing- 
ton a national championship with a 25-22 vic- 
tory in Seattle. The overall record (6-6) wasn't 
so hot and neither was the 4-4 conference 
finish that left the Bruins tied for sixth with 
Stanford. But the Bruins lost three Pac-10 
games in the final minutes. Now that the 6-4 
Maddox has a season under his belt, they 
could well get luckier. 

Maddox will be throwing to Sean LaCha- 
pelle (39 catches for 607 yards), along with 
sophomores Michael Mocre and Bryan Ad- 


ams, who will try to replace third-team All- 
America Scott Miller and Reggie Moore. Se- 
nior Kevin Smith (6-4, 256) figures to be one of 
the best fullbacks on the West Coast, but 
coach Terry Donahue still needs to get more 
out of the tailback position, where starter Brian 
Brown is gone. Prep All-America James Milli- 
ner might challenge returnees Shawn Wills, 
Kevin Williams, Ricky Davis, and redshirt 
freshman Daron Washington, who's the big- 
gest of the group at 6-3 and 206. 

Rick Daly may step in at tight end for Randy 
Austin and Corwin Anthony, and the interior 
offensive line looks strong with sophomores 
Craig Novitsky and Vaughn Parker or junior 
Rick Fuller at tackle, Scott Spalding and Mike 
Linn al guard, and Aron Gideon at center. “I 
would expect we'll be improved in all areas of 
line play,” Donahue said.

Senior Emmanuei Onwutuebe is back at 
nose guard, but the key to the defensive front 
may well be how Mike Chalenski has recov- 
ered from offseason shoulder surgery. The 
other line starter should be Brian Kelly. 
There's plenty of experience at inside line- 
backer, where honors candidate Amold Ale is 
joined by Stacy Argo, James Malone, and 
Meech Shaw, all of whom started at least four 
games in 1990. But outside linebacking looks 
thin with the departure of Roman Phifer, Ro- 
cen Keeton, and Brian Lockwood. Randy Cole 
and sophomore Bradley Craig will get first 
look, but Consensus prep All-America Jamir 
Miller could be a factor here as well. 

There are no problems in the secondary, 
where three starters return to a unit that was 
second in the Pac-10 in efficiency last season. 
The leader is senior strong safety Matt Darby, 
who has elicited comparisons to former Bruin 
All-Americas Kenny Easley and Don Rogers. 


Ware 


He'll be joined by a pair of two-year starters at 
cornerback, Dion Lambert and Carlton Gray, 
who combined for 84 tackles and held oppo- 
nents to just 6.7 yards per pass altempt, and 
Michael Williams in place of star free safety 
Eric Turner, the No. 2 pick in the NFL draft. 

Courtney Keyler, a sophomore who aver- 
aged 40.1 yards on 51 punts, is back, but the 
place-kicking job is uncertain now that Brad 
Daluiso is gone. Dominic Sandifer, a letterman 
way back in 1988, is a possibility. 

After a couple of stormy seasons, it looks as 
if stability has returned to Westwood. Dona- 
hue will have the same group of full-time as- 
sistants for the first time since 1986. 


CALIFORNIA 

It took more than a little while, but the Bears 
had their first upper-division conference finish 
since 1979 last season (4-3-1 and fourth in the 
Pac-10, 7-4-1 overall) and went an to beat 
Wyoming in the Copper Bowl. If coach Bruce 
Snyder can construct a defense to go along 
with an offense that averaged 396 yards and 
28 points per game, even better things could 
be in store this fall. 


84 


Eight offensive starters return, along with 
tailback Russel! White. who alternated with 
Anthony Wallace last year and still gained 
1,000 yards. He'll team with quarterback Mike 
Pawlawski, who completed 59.9 percent of his 
pass attempts and came within just one TD 
pass of Troy Taylor's schoo! record of 18, and 
unsung fullback Greg Zomalt, who may be the 
Pac-10's best blocker at his position. Brian 
Treggs, who needs just 15 catches to become 
Cal's all-time leading receiver, and Sean Daw- 
kins are both big-play performers, and will be 


ts 


California 


joined in slotback formations by sophomore 
Mike Caldwell. Veteran Brent Woodall returns 
at tight end. 

Three of the West's best are in the Bear 
offensive front. Four-year starter Troy Au- 
zenne will be at one tackle, with sophomore 
Todd Steussie at the other and senior Steve 
Gordon, who Snyder says is the best college 
center he's coached in his 23 years in the 
profession, anchoring the middle. A pair of 
newcomers, Sam Sagapolu (6-0, 340) and 
Eric Mahtum, likely will open at guard. Snyder 
thinks he has no fewer than nine legitimate 
honors candidates on offense. 

it's on defense where the Bears likely will 
make or break their season. Only four starters 
return from a unit that ranked ninth in the con- 
ference, giving up 428.5 yards per game. and 
had a distressing propensity for fading late in 


games. There will be unproven players nearly 
everywhere this season, but defensive coordi- 
nator Kent Baer said. “This is the fastest and 
quickest group we've ever had here.” 

Two players who fit that mold, Mack Travis 
and Chidi Ahanotu, should start up front, 
probably with senior Ryan Peery or one of two 
redshirt freshmen, Brad Monahan or Brad 
Bowers. California JC Defensive Player of the 
Year Stafford Evans may figure. too. Cornell 
Collier, who has shown flashes of potential, 
and Jason Wilborn are the likely outside line- 
backers, with sophomore Bill Ayer and new- 
comer Mick Barsala inside. The secondary 
looks well-manned, with three starters back. 
David Wilson (team-leading 72 tackles) and 
sophomore Eric Zomalt are the safeties, with 
Chris Cannon, who came on well late, at one 
comerback. Sophomore Jody Graham may 
have an edge at the other cornerback spot. 
but Snyder will give transfer Wolf Barber a 
good !ook this fall. 

There are questions in the kicking game 
with the departure of All-America Robbie 
Keen. Freshman Chad Kraemer, who hit six 
field goals of 46 yards or longer as a prep last 
season and averaged 43.8 yards per punt. 
certainty would appear to have the leg to 
wrest the jobs from squadmen Doug O'Brien 
and Chris Noonan 

“A logical progression for our team would 
be a January 1 bow! game,” Snyder said. 
“We've established ourselves as a good pro- 
gram, but we have to re-earn that respect.” 


OREGON 
Believe it or not, the Ducks finally will be start- 
ing a season without Bill Musgrave at quarter- 
back, and it's possible that could spell more 
trouble than anything has in a very long time in 
Eugene. Seldom has a quarterback been 
more of the heart and soul of a team than 
Musgrave was of this one. During his four sea- 
sons, the Ducks were 25-10 in games he start- 
ed and finished, and won just three times 
when he didn’t start. In 1990, the team fin- 
ished 8-4 for the second straight year, went 4- 
3 and tied for third in the Pac-10, and went to 
the Freedom Bowl. So what happens now? 
“We're going to have to prove once and for all 


STREET AND SMITH S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


we can win without Bill Musgrave at quarter- 
back,” coach Rich Brooks said. 

The Ducks, who have built one of the con- 
ference's best defenses over the last four sea- 
sons, probably will have to win with defense 
this time, since eight starters retum, com- 
pared with just four on offense. The eight in- 
clude the all-senior front line of ends Matt La- 
Bounty and Jeff Cummins, who combined for 
24 of a school-record 41 quarterback sacks in 
1990, and nose tackle Marcus Woods; line- 
backers Andy Conner, James Bautista. and 
Joe Farwell; cornerback Daryle Smith, and 
free safety Eric Castle. The other likely start- 
ers: Doug Douglass in place of all-conference 
Peter Brantley at outside linebacker; top 
backup Devon Hosey at cornerback, and 
sophomore Paul Rodriguez or junior redshirt 
Kenny Phillips at strong safety. 

The kicking game should be first-rate with 
junior Gregg McCallum, who may hold all the 
school place-kicking records by the end of his 
career, and sophomore punter Tommy 
Thompson (40.6-yard average). 

Which brings us to the big question mark: 
the Duck offense. The only starters returning 
are tackle David Collingsworth, guard Bud 
Bowie, tight end Jeff Thomason, and sopho- 
more star-in-the-making tailback Sean Bur- 
well, who was the league's No. 4 rusher, with 
969 yards, averaged 27.6 yards on 11 kickoff 
returns, and was his team's No. 3 receiver. 

In addition to the loss of Musgrave, the re- 
ceiving corps was decimated. The new signal 
caller may be national JC quarterback of the 
year Brett Salisbury, a 6-3, 200-pounder from 
Palomar (CA) College. The new receivers may 


Matt L 
Ne 


be Ronnie Harris and Brian Brown. Injury- 
plagued fullbacks Brandon Jumper and Juan 
Shedrick figure to team with Burwell. 

Joining Thomason, a second-team, all-con- 
farence choice, Collingsworth, and Bowie in 
the offensive line should be Todd Gydesen, 
Steve Hardin, or Matt Martin at tackle; Jon 
Tattersall at guard, and Greg Phillips at cen- 
ter, although Brooks says this unit may still be 
far from set. “There isn't any question that our 
redshirt freshman class in the offensive line 
will have an impact, and a couple could start.” 

Brooks knows the defense may have to car- 
ty a bigger part of the load than the offense, at 
least early in the season, but he seems to think 
that despite the player losses, the Ducks can 
stay in the upper echelon of the Pac-10. 
“We've got our work cut out for us to prove 
that we're going to be the type of team we 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


have been," said Brooks, who has now 
coached the Ducks in three decades, “bul we 
feel all the ingredients are there to have anoth- 
er successful year.” 


STANFORD 

The Cardinal will celebrate 100 years of foot- 
bail this fall, but whether it really celebrates 
may depend on whether it can successfully 
negotiate a schedule that includes eight op- 
ponents who played in bow! games, two that 
were No. 1-ranked during 1990, and five that 
were in the nation’s top 10. That's enough to 
temper the smile on the face of coach Dennis 
Green over the nine offensive and eight de- 


fensive starters he has returning from a team 
that was 5-6 overall, 4-4 and tied for sixth in 
the Pac-10, beat Notre Dame, could have 
topped Colorado, and closed with three 
straight victories. 

Offensively, the only losses are All-America 
wide receiver Ed McCaffrey and guard Chuck 
Gillingham. Heisman Trophy candidate Glyn 
Milburn will be joined in the backfield by quar- 
terback Jason Palumbis and fullback Tommy 
Vardell, both honorable mention all-Pac-10. 
Jon Pinckey (29 receptions) is back at flanker, 
with Chris Walsh likely to replace McCaffrey, 
and either Paul Nickel! or Turner Baur, back 
after major knee surgery, at tight end.

Junior Bob Whitfield, a finalist for the 1990 
Outland Trophy, and Steve Hoyem will work at 
tackle, with Brian Cassidy and Glen Cavan- 
augh at guard and Chris Daiman at center. it's 
a unit that averages 294 pounds and figures 
to be among the best in the conference. 

Paul Stonehouse (38.8) returns for his third 
season as the Cardinal punter, while the 
place-kicking duties vacated by John Hop- 
kins likely will go to sophomore Aaron Mills. 

The defense is less sure than the offense, 
except at outside linebacker, where juniors 
Dave Garnett and Ron George are gems. 
George was No. 1 in the Pac-10 with 18 tack- 
les for loss and No. 2 in quarterback sacks, 


aha 


with 10, Four-year starter Jono Tunney is gone 
inside, leaving Green with a huge hole to fill 
there. Sophomore Hartwell Brown will battle 
Dan Byers, Tom Williams, and Kevin Puk for 
playing time. 

There's plenty of competition in the defen- 
sive line, too, where tackle Estevan Avila and 
nose guard Aaron Rembisz return. Tyler Bat- 
son may join them, but sophomore Mike Jer- 
ich could well give him an argument. Three 
starters—Seyon Albert, Darrien Gordon, and 
Albert Richardson—are back in the second- 
ary. Seyon Albert. was second on the team 
with 79 tackles from free safety. But the Cardi- 
nal will miss all-Pac-10 cornerback Kevin 
Scott and strong safety Jimmy Kiein, who suf- 
fered a serious knee injury while playing for 
the school's volleyball team and is question- 
able. Josh Wright is slated as the starter at the 
other corner, but he'll be pushed by fellow 
soph Vaughn Bryant. 

With the maturation of players like Milburn 
and Whitfield, this almost certainly will be a 
better team. But it may not show in the won- 
loss record because of a schedule that again 
has Notre Dame and Colorado on it, along 
with all the Pac-10 biggies. The one seeming 
break: Cornell at home on October 12. 

Green is talking optimistically. "| expect the 
momentum fram our final three games last 
season to be a catalyst,” he said. “I think our 
entire program benefited form the caliber of 
opponents we played last season.”

ARIZONA 

Without making a lot of noise, Dick Tomey’s 
Wildcats have compiled the third-best record 
in the Pac-10 over the last three seasons, and 
the second-most victories in conference play. 
Coming off a 7-5 overall mark that included a 
5-4 record and a fifth-place finish in the con- 
ference. Tomey said, “| don't see us any aif- 
ferent. We will be very competitive.” 

Tomey. who has turned the ‘Cats into the 
pre-eminent rushing team on the West Coast 
in his five seasons in Tucson, hopes to tie ina 
little better passing game this year. Now that 
Ronald Veal is gone, George Malauulu should 
have the starting quarterback spot all to him- 
self, backed by redshirt fresnmen Charles 
Levy and Jason Harvey. The key receivers will 
be Terry Vaughn, who had 22 catches for 431 
yards in the final seven games, and tight end 
Richard Griffith, one of the conference's best. 

Art Greathouse will be missing from the al- 
ways-tough rushing attack, but back are 
Mario Hampton, sophomore Lamont Lovett. 
and all-purpose Michael Bates, who was third 
in the Pac-10 in kickoff returns and should see 
more rushing action. 

The offensive line figures to be better, with 
two-year starter John Fina and either Sam 
Ross or Vincent Smith at tackle, Nick Finean- 
ganofo (another two-year starter) and Mike 
Ciasca at guard, and injury-prone Paul Toffle- 


mire, backed by redshirt Mu Tagoai, at center. 
The place-kicking duties, now that Gary Cos- 
ton is gone, should be taken over by redshin 
freshman Steve McLaughlin. 

Tomey thinks he has a solid nucleus on de- 
fense, and he'll need it, since the unit gave up 
26 or more points in six of the final nine 
games. The starters up front figure to be tack- 
le Ty Parten, who is coming off corrective 
shoulder surgery, sophomore tackle Jimmie 
Hopkins, who is moving over from outside 
linebacker, and soph nose guard Rob Wal- 
drop, who started six games as a freshman. 

The linebacking corps is led by Richard 
Maddox. who had offseason foot surgery, out- 
side, and Marcel Wade inside. Competing to 
join them as starters are Roderick Lewis, 
Corey Pittman, Gregg Shapiro. Craig Gilbert. 
and transfers Shawn Jarrett and Jamal Lee. 
The ‘Cats graduated three players who had 
all-conference honors during their careers, 


the most notable being Jim Thorpe Award 
winner Darry! Lewis. But there is some return- 
ing experience in senior strong safety Richard 
Hold and comerback Bobby Roland, who saw 
service at nicxel back a year ago. Joining the 
unit will be JC All-America cornerback Darryl 
Morrison, who will compete with veterans 
Heath Bray. William Dixon. and Jey Phillips: 
sophs Tony Bouie and Mike Scurlock. and 
transfer Keshon Johnson. Transfer Jay Kir- 
choff may well challenge punters Adam 
Grand and Josh Miller, who averaged just 
33.3 yarGs and had two kicks blocked. 

Tomey has proved he knows how to win. but 
Malauulu has to develop more consistency 
and there has to be noticeable improvement 
in the defense and the kicking game if the 
‘Cats are to be more than just competitive. 


ARIZONA STATE 

At first took, you might think Sun Devils’ coach 
Larry Marmie should send out an SOS. At sec- 
ond look. too. He tost 14 significant players off 


a team that was just 4-7 overall and 2-5 and 
and in eighth place in the Pac-10. Now he has 
to operate without the likes of quarterback 
Paul Justin, strong safety Nathan LaDuke., free 
safety Floyd Fields. tailback Leonard Russell, 
and linebacker Drew Metcalf. 

But during one three-game stretch, the Sun 
Devils played without nine full-time regulars. 
and 19 different players missed a total of 87 
Starts in 1990. What that means is the team 


STREET AND SMITHS COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


now has seven offensive and nine defensive 
players with starting experience, and also re- 
turns place-kicker Mike Richey (11 of 13 on 
field-goal attempts). 

Much will depend on how well sophomore 
Bret Powers—or somebody—replaces Justin, 
one of the Pac-10's best. And how well soph 
George Montgomery or JC transfer Jerone 
Davison fills in for Russell, who made himself 
available for the NFL draft early after gaining 
810 yards. Montgomery started last season 
before being sidelined by shin splints. Steady 
senior Kelvin Fisher (677 yards rushing) re- 
turns at fullback. 

Eric Guliford, honorable mention all-Pac-10 
after catching 48 passes for 837 yards, will be 
at split end, with Eric Moss at flanker and Bob 
Brasher replacing Ryan McReynolds at tight 
end. Marmie is hoping for a more physical 
offensive line, with sophomore Toby Mills at 
center, Jeff White and Bob Robertson at 
guard, and Tim Kirby and Mike Ritter (6-7, 
293) at tackle. 

There seems to be talent back on defense, 
although this is a unit that was no better than 
sixth in the Pac-10 against both the rush and 
the pass last season. The leader is senior cor- 
nerback Phillippi Sparks, who was second- 
team all-conference in 1990. He'll team with 
Kevin Miniefield, but the situation is not nearly 
so clear at the safety spots, where Michael 


Williams, Mark Brown, Adam Brass, and Ken- 
dall Rhyne are the primary contenders. 

Seniar Shane Collins has to be rated a 
question mark in the line because of knee sur- 
gery, but the Sun Devils should be stronger up 
front nonetheless, with the likes of David Dix- 
on (6-6, 318), Arthur Dixon, Tim Landers, Jeff 
Maier, and Pat Mason. The linebacking corps 
should be solid and quick, with Darren Wood- 
son (73 tackles in just eight games) and Bryan 
Hooks outside and returning starter Brett Wal- 
lerstedt and one of two redshirt freshmen, 
Justin Dragoo or Raythan Smith, inside. Steve 
Rausch, who handles long field goals, is also 
expected to handle the punting duties. 

Despite Marmie’s optimism, it’s hard to see 
this as a better squad than last season's, par- 
ticularly with the subtraction of offensive 
weapons like Justin and Russell. The sched- 
ule is a virtual minefield, too. It includes six 
teams that were in bowl games. 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


WASHINGTON STATE 

Things were not good in Pullman last season, 
when the Cougars finished 3-8—their worst 
windup since 1976—and were just 2-6 and in 
ninth place in the Pac-10, amid stories of team 
dissension and low morale. Coach Mike Price 
went shopping for junior-college talent, and it 
looks as if his team will have a productive 
offense, although the line has to cooperate. 
But there is inexperience on defense, and a 
tack of depth. 

Price demoted quarterbacks Brad Gossen 
and Aaron Garcia last season in favor of fresh- 
man Drew Bledsoe. That didn't please Garcia, 
in particular, but Bledsoe threw for 1,320 
yards and 13 touchdowns in the last five 
games. He's a full-fledged No. 1 now, with 
Garcia backing him. And he'll be firing again 
to his top two receivers, sophomore wideout 
Phillip Bobo (51 receptions for 758 yards) and 
junior all-Pac-10 tight end Clarence “Butch” 
Williams (43-623). Joining the mix are 1989 
starting wide receiver C.J. Davis, hurt last 


pene Bobo 
fashington Stat 


year, and transfer Calvin Schexnayder. 
Shaumbe Wright-Fair, who displaced Rich 
Swinton in 1980 and rushed for a team-high 
739 yards, will open at running back, with Paul 
Carr and Ron Childs supporting him. 

The line returns starting tackles Bob Gar- 
man and Mike Bailey; Steve Wolfe figures at 
one guard, but the other guard and center 
spots are being contested by a group that 
includes Quinn Magnuson, Dustin Smith, 
Andy Tribble, and sophomore Josh Dunning. 

The Cougars still have a rare two-way 
weapon in gifted senior Jason Hanson, who 
became just the third player ever to be named 
all-Pac-10 as both a punter and a place-kick- 
er. He averaged 39.3 yards per punt, was 17 
for 26 on field goals, and hit all 29 extra points. 

Defensively, the major returnees are end 
Lee Tilleman, who had a team-high 8% tack- 
les for loss and 5% sacks; cornerback Mi- 
chael Wright and strong safety Anthony Prior, 
who's moving over from a corner spot. Kirk 
Westerfield and Constantine Romero and 
sophomore Vince Saldivar should join Tille- 
man up front. with touted junior Lewis Bush, 
who redshirted last season, and Rod Plummer 
at linebackers and Kurt Loertscher at rover. 
Curtis Geathers looks ahead for the other cor- 
nerback spot, with Darryl Hamilton probable 
at free safety. 

Price's JC talent hunt brought in tackle 
Chris Frank, linebackers Eric Thompson and 
Kevin Ashworth, and rover Mark Fields, all of 
whom could contribute to a defense that gave 


up 381 points—95 more than even a good 
offense could muster. 

“We have much better team speed on de- 
fense than we had last year,” Price said. 
“That's a strength. We are trying to get our 
fastest, toughest, most aggressive players on 
the field, and that may mean a change in our 
alignments—maybe an odd-man defense or 
the use of three or four linebackers.” 


OREGON STATE 

The last time the Beavers made much noise in 
West Coast football-way back in the late 
1860s—they used an option-style offense. 
Quarterback Steve Preece and fullback Bill 
Enyart are long gone, but maybe the new Bea- 
vers can recapture a little of the old magic with 
the spread-option offense of coach Jerry Pet- 
tibone, who takes over from Dave Kragthorpe, 
dismissed after becoming another in a long 
line of coaches to fail in Corvailis. Kragth- 
orpe’s 1990 team was just 1-10. 

Pettibone’s 1990 Northern Illinois team 
ranked No. 1 in the nation in rushing offense 
(344.6 yards a game), and he has a proven 
record as a recruiter, too, in stints as an agsis- 
tant at Oklahoma, Nebraska, Southern Meth- 
odist, and Texas A&M. 

It's probably asking too much for him to turn 
the Beavers around this season, however, 
since the spread option depends on a skilled 
quarterback, and Pettibone was looking for 
one in the spring. Kragthorpe holdovers Ed 
Browning and Kent Riddle will be given first 
chance. Running backs Dwayne Owens and 
James Jones, each of whom gained 364 
yards rushing last season, could blossom in 


“the new attack. Owens, a potential star, had 


more than 100 all-purpose yards in eight 
straight games and was the team's Rookie of 
the Year. Converted defensive players Doug 
Lewis and Chad Paulson will offer support. 

The wide receivers won't get as much work 
as they did in Kragthorpe's pro-style attack, 
but 5-8 junior Maurice Wilson has some abili- 
ty. He led the squad with 41 receptions for 425 
yards. Senior tight end Jason Blum, who'll re- 
place the departed George Breland, should 
be featured more prominently. The offensive 
line could be a strength, with four starters 
back, including sophomore tackles Christian 
Miller and Adam Albaugh, guard Fletcher 
Keister, and center Tom Nordquist. The other 
guard should be sophomore Jim Buchanan or 
Dan Blus. Place-kicker Jamie Burke, who hit 
six of seven field-goal tries, returns. 

The defense is a bit more experienced than 
the offense, although four starters are gone, 
and one of them, tackle Esera Tuaolo, will be 
extremely difficult to replace. Pettibone will 
throw JC transfer tackle Mark Cottingham into 
a mix up front that also will include returning 
starter Chad de Sully, Thomas Bookman, Sai- 
lusi Poulivaati, Ricky Fizer, and Anthony Glov- 
er. The linebacking looks fairly solid with Todd 
Sahifield, who was honorable mention all-Pac- 
10, in the middie and Eric Davis and Mark 
Price or Tony O'Billovich outside. The second- 
ary returns four players who have starting ex- 
perience: Zechariah Davis and Earl Zackery 
at the corners, Brent Huff and sophomore 
Dennis Edwards at safeties. Huff, who was 
second-team all-conference, could be the 
team’s best player. The punter again will be 
sophomore Tim Kollas (37.0). 

“We have some good athletes," Pettibone 
said, “but we have to develop more depth."

FRESNO STATE 

The Bulldogs’ hopes for continuing national 
respectability— not to mention national rank- 
ing—were severely damaged by a single 
game during the 1990 season: a 73-18 loss at 
Northern Illinois. Jim Sweeney's team won't 
have to wait long to try to avenge that mortify- 
ing defeat. The teams meet in the season 
opener at Fresno September 7. The Bulldogs 
were 8-2-1 in 1990 and 5-1-1 and tied for sec- 
ond in the Big West, and there's no reason 
why they can't return to the top of the confer- 
ence for the sixth time under Sweeney. 

Three all-conference first-teamers —run- 
ning back Aaron Craver, defensive lineman 
Nick Ruggeroli, and comerback Taylor Coo- 
per—have moved on. But four are back, in- 
cluding Big West co-Defensive Player of the 
Year Marquez Pope at free safety, offensive 
linemen Jesse Hardwick and Melvin Johnson, 
and comerback Tony Brown. 

Quarterback Mark Barsotti, who has guided 
FSU to a 29-5-1 record in three seasons and is 
second on the school's all-time passing list, 
again will direct the offense. He'll have veter- 
an flanker Kelvin Mears back from foot sur- 
gery, fullback Lorenzo Neal (580 yards rush- 
ing), tight end Marty Thompson, and linemen 
Johnson (6-1, 320), Hardwick (6-5, 290), Ron 
Collins, and Keland Jackson with him. Other 
projected offensive starters are either Frank 
Jones or Lee Harris at split end, sophomore 
Burt Prentice at center, and ‘90 backups 
James Allison and Ricky White or transfer An- 
thony Daigle in place of Craver, who gained 
1,003 yards. Leading scorer Derek Mahoney 
(74 points) is back as the place-kicker. 


Second-team ail-Big West linebacker Jeff 
Thiesen and linemen Earl Oliver, Judd Foel, 
and Zack Rix top the defense along with Pope, 
who may be the West's best defender, and 
Brown. Other possible starters: Pete Jenkins 
and either Chris Peters or Darren Boyer at in- 
side linebacker, Steve Lee at rover, and Chris 
Rockwell or transfer Nick Serfas at end. Sta- 
cey Wilcots is likely to take over for leading 
tackler Mark Adams at strong safety, with Em- 
ery Braxton at the other corner. Sweeney also 
likes transfer defensive back Brian Porter. The 
punter is Brad Seagle (38.6 yards per kick.) 


UTAH STATE 

Coach Chuck Shelton may really have some- 
thing this season, if another withering noncon- 
ference schedule doesn't interfere. He has 16 


88 


starters back from a team that was only 5-5-1 
overall but finished 5-1-1 and in second place 
in the Big West. Among his returnees are se- 
nior running back Roger Grant, who is No. 2 
among returning NCAA rushers with 124.55 
yards per game; wide receiver Tracey Jen- 
kins, who led the country with 14 TD recep- 
tions in 1990; and two all-conference kickers, 
Doug Beach and punter Rusty Carlsen, who 
averaged more than 42 yards per kick. 

But, oh, that schedule! The Aggies have to 
play Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Brigham 
Young, so Shelton will have to hope what he 
thinks is newfound depth is for real. He does 
have plenty of assets. however. Quarterback 
Ron Lopez threw for 1,961 yards, and he 
again will have favorite targets Jenkins, who 
had 52 catches, and Rod Moore, who had 47. 
The running game will feature not only Grant 
but Floyd Foreman, who was second-team all- 
Big West, and transfer Robby Clemons. 
There’s a big, veteran line, led by tackle Ed 
Silva, Charlie Smith, Greg O'Banion, Warren 
Bowers, and Jaceson Maughan. although 
Shelton needs a tight end to replace the de- 
parted Ryan Duve and Monte Ahiemeyer. 


The defensive headliners are tackles Rob 
VanDePol and Steve Neeleman, nose guard 
Mark Johnson, inside tinebacker Del Lyles, 
and backs Toby Tyler and Ron Edwards. Also 
returning is Damon Smith, a reserve free safe- 
ty who led the Big West in interceptions (5) as 
a freshman. The chief concerns are at line- 
backer, where Piliki Tauteoli, Kevin Bouwman, 
and Tom Hansen all are gone. Transfer Ernie 
Goddard could help. The Aggies get a big 
break in conference play this season by draw- 
ing both Fresno State and San Jose State at 
home. But just as much may depend on how 
they can survive afternoons in Lincoln, Nor- 
man, and Provo. 


SAN JOSE STATE 

You couldn't have asked much more of Terry 
Shea. In his first year as head coach of the 
Spartans, he led his team to a 9-2-1 record, a 
perfect 7-0 in Big West play, and a 48-24 
victory over Central Michigan in the Raisin 
Bowl. And he just might do it again, although 
the guess is he may not have enough retum- 
ing to fend off perennial power Fresno State or 


emerging power Utah State. Still, he said, “We 
see ourselves as atop 20 program.” . 

Team speed led the Spartans in 1990 and 
should again in ‘91, although tailback Sheldon 
Canley, quarterback Ralph Martini, and four 
line starters are gone from the offense, and 
seven starters, including linebacker Lyneil 
Mayo, from the defense. 

One of two talented redshirts — 1989 starter 
Matt Veatch or Jeff Garcia —will replace Marti- 
ni, with Maceo Barbosa taking over for Can- 
ley, who rushed for 1.248 yards. The receiving 
corps, with all-Big West tight end Bryce Bur- 
nett (23 catches for 451 yards) and wideouts 
like Bobby Blackmon (39 receptions for 599 
yards), Waiter Brooks, and Byron Jackson is 
deep and skilled. But the offensive line, which 
returns only all-conference first-team tackle 
Peni loseta (6-3, 277) is the key. Guard Nick 
Trammer, who started five games, is the next 
most experienced fineman. Eight JC transfers 
will help fill the vacancies. 

The main defensive concem is at lineback- 
er, where Mayo, the Big West co-Defensive 
Piayer of the Year, Mike Scialabba, and lead- 
ing tackler Steve Hieber all are gone, and only 
senior Chris Clarke retums. JC All-America 
Phi! Lobsinger could step right in. The line will 
have to be rebuilt. too, with Simon Vaoifi the 
lone returning starter The secondary !ooks 
more set, with retumee Freddie Smith and El- 
liott Franklin at the corners and two-time all- 
Big West pick Heshimu Colar and Anthony 
Washington at safeties. Punter Eric Negrey re- 
turns but the place-kicking job is open. 


LONG BEACH STATE 

The late George Allen did a lot toward turning 
the 49ers’ program around in his one season 
as head coach. Now it's Allen assistant Willie 


Brown's turn to see what he can do to keep 
the resurgence going. The Hall of Fame de- 
fensive back will inherit 15 starters from a 
team that was 6-5 overall (the first winning 
season since 1986) and 4-3 and in fourth 
place in the Big West. 

Defense. always an Allen staple. should be 
the key if the 49ers are to move up. Eight 
starters are back, led by first-team ail-confer- 
ence senior end Edward Lair and linemates 


STREET AND SMITHS CCALEGE FOOTBALL 


Chris Stetz, Tony Perry (6-6, 270), and John 
Grimes. First-team ail-Big West pick Pepper 
Jenkins is missing from the linebacking corps, 
but that unit should be strong again with re- 
turning starters Calvin Thomas and Chris 
Tsangaris joined by John Hickey, Sean Chan- 
dier, or Dante Venturelli. Two starters, Leon 
Patterson and Shawn Wilbourn, departed the 
secondary, but a solid nucleus returns, led by 
10-game starters Shawn Lawson and Bingo 
Williams. Seven 1990 redshirts will battle the 
likes of Chris Comick, Earnest Johnson, Torrin 
Johnson, and Chad Wilson for playing time. 
Second-team all-Big West «selection Sean 
Cheevers (13 of 17 field goal attempts, all 27 
PATs) returns, as does punter Ray Magana. 
Brown will aim for more balance in an of- 
fense that picked up 247.6 of its 370.6 yards 
per game via the air. Senior quarterback Todd 
Studer (2,618 yards passing) will again direct 
the attack, throwing to a deep receiving corps 
led by Mark Seay (48 receptions for 771 
yards), Jeff Exum, Keith Fitzgerald, and Ger- 


so 


* Del Lyles 
Utah State 


ald Woodyard. The lone returning starter at 
running back is senior Rickey Clark (327 
yards rushing), so Brown will look to redshirts. 
In the line, where two starters are gone, the 
top prospects are tackles Kelly Schlegel and 
Corey Yeager and tight ends Byron Hamilton 
and Joel Glick, who split time. 


PACIFIC 

The Tigers discovered a magic arm in 1990, 
as sophomore quarterback Troy Kopp passed 
for 3,311 yards in only nine games, an aver- 
age of 347.2 per game, third-best in the na- 
tion. Despite that brilliance, the team could 
manage just a 4-7 overall record, 2-5 and in 
sixth place in the Big West. Coach Walt Harris 
hopes the air game can produce better num- 
bers in 1991. 

Kopp again will work with top returning re- 
ceiver Aaron Turner (66 catches for 1,264 
yards), Daryl Hobbs (62 for 848), Melvin John- 
son (53 for 542), Oscar Meza, and Jason Ed- 
wards. But Harris needs to get more balance 
from the running-back corps led by Steve 
Meni, Anthony Williams, and Jessie Campbell. 
The best linemen are honorable mention ail- 
Big West selections Chris Baus and Greg 
Bishop, 11-game starting tackle Randy Paul- 
tetto, and starting center Glenn McElderry. 

The defensive front is uncertain, since just 
one starting lineman, Eric Bengston, and one 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


outside linebacker, Peter Miller, return. The Ti- 
gers will look to JC transfers Sam Tonikian and 
Greg Milam to make an immediate impact, 
The situation is more settled at inside line- 
backer, where touted sophomore Ron Papa- 
zian (97 total! tackles) will be joined by Matt 
Volpe and Shawn Tennenbaum. 

Transfer Chuckie Bibbs may push retuming 
starter Troy Reeves, Gordon Jones, and Dimi- 
tri Gazelas at cornerback, with seniors Kyron 
Johnson, the team's leading sacker in 1990, 
and Brent Atkins at strong safety, and young- 
sters Jeff Russell, who started as a freshman 
last season until he was hurt, and Nathan 
Young at free safety. The kicking game will be 
led by newcomer Eddie Ausherman, a first- 
team JC All-America who could handle both 
place-kicking and punting duties, although re- 
turing kicker Jason Schouten and punter 
Tony Nordbeck will challenge. 


NEVADA LAS VEGAS 

Former Notre Dame offensive coordinator Jim 
Strong had a so-so start in his first season as 
head coach of the Rebels, finishing with a 4-7 
overall record, 3-4 and in fifth place in the Big 
West. This fall, he'll be minus 11 starters, six of 
them on offense, so major improvement may 
take a while, particularly since UNLV has two 
Pac-10 teams on its schedule. 

There are two big offensive assets: third- 
year starter Derek Stott, who passed for 1,877 
yards, at quarterback and 5-9 senior Hunkie 
Cooper at just about everything. Cooper 
played quarterback, wide receiver, and run- 
ning back last season, in addition to returning 
punts and kickoffs, and was named team MVP 
despite the fact he started only three games. 
He should ba featured as a wide receiver this 
season, where he'll join sophomore John 
Ma’‘ae. Back up front are two honors candi- 
dates: tackle Jerry Reynolds (6-6, 297) and 
senior center Joe Biritz. But the Rebels may 
have trouble replacing all-conference wide re- 
ceiver Keenan McCardell and leading rusher 
Marvin Eastman. The offensive line was also 
depleted by graduation. 

Defensively, the deep and talented line- 
backing corps might be the best in the confer- 
ence. The leaders are senior Stacy Monroe 
and a quartet of sophomores: Rumone Hilton, 
Reese Thomas, Kenneth Crump, and Keith 
Clough. The secundary looks better, too, with 
three returning starters: David Efferson, Rod- 
ney Crozier, and leading tackler Carlton John- 
son. They may be joined by sophomore 
Auntwan Armstrong, who doubles as a wide 
receiver. Mansfield Dinkins and Elgin Lofton 
should work with returning starter Chuck Reed 
in the fine, which loses Aaron Christian and 
David Clarke. But redshirts Lonnie Palelei and 
Cedric Leonard may figure. 

Transfer punter Brian Parvin of Mt. San An- 
tonio JC comes very highly touted. The Re- 
bels will need a new place-kicker, since both 
Luis Solorio and Todd Amrein graduated. 


NEW MEXICO STATE 
It was another disastrous season in Las Cru- 
ces, but the Aggies’ lone victory in 11 tries did 
come in the last game of the year (43-9 over 
Cal State Fullerton), and coach Jim Hess is 
hoping for a little carry-over. He's added 20 
JC transfers to 38 lettermen, which includes 
seven defensive and five offensive starters. 
The two top tacklers—senior middle line- 
backer Steve Campbell and sophomore safe- 


ty Donald Stowers—both retum. Campbell, a 
second-team all-Big West choice, had 135 
stops. But Hess has to do something about a 
run defense that ranked fast in the confer- 
ence. The front four should include seniors 
Loren Dunlap, Chad Glover, and Shawn 
Moore and junior Sam Austrino, who was limit- 
ed in spring practice by a foot injury. Teaming 
with Campbell at linebacker will be Brian Car- 
ter and former running back Demoin DeShay. 
Chad Baum should complement Stowers 


- nicely at safety, but both cornerbacks—Lolo 


James and Marvon Spelil—have departed. 
Danny Mitchell and George Sykes will get first 
call to replace them. 

The Aggies have the experienced quarter- 
back they lacked at the start of fast season in 
senior David Chisum, who broke the school 
record for single-season pass completions, 
with 187, and passed for 2,277 yards. Full- 
back Jimmie Mitchell (832 yards rushing) may 
be granted an extra year of eligibility. If he isn’t 
back, newcomer Daryle Donahue is the !ead- 
ing contender for his job, with smallish junior 
Ray Washington, who was fourth in the nation 
in kickoff retums, at halfback. Todd Cutler (32 
catches for 435 yards) is back at tight end, but 
with Alvin Warren and Richard Sanchez gone, 
the wide-receiver spots took thin. The offen- 
sive line, which yielded 54 sacks in 1990, is 
uncertain, too, although highly touted transfer 
Sean Bowman should help. Punter Garret 
Henson may also handle the place-kicking. 


CAL STATE FULLERTON 

After a year that produced just one victory in 
12 games and a last-place finish in the Big 
West, the Titan football program spent the off- 
season in a fight for survival. The school's Ath- 
letics Council recommended dropping the 
sport in January because of severe budget 
restrictions. It got a reprieve in February after 
a pledge of community financial support, but 
coach Gene Murphy is still struggling to hold 
things together in 1991 with a cut-down staff. 
There again will be no schedule breaks in 
nonconference play (Mississippi State, Texas 
Tech, and Georgia). 

Offensively, the best hope is senicr running 
back Reggie Yarbrough, a second-team all- 
Big West pick who rushed for 1,014 yards, 
becoming only the fifth Titan ever to top 1,000. 
Redshirt Chad May will challenge '90 backup 
Terry Payne at quarterback. The receiving 
corps will be headed by Kerry Reed, who had 
37 receptions for 467 yards despite missing 
three games with a knee injury. Murphy has 
been tinkering with an offensive line that could 
be fairly solid despite a lack of experienced 
depth. Guard Shannon Illingworth, a 1989 
starter who injured a knee in the 'S0 opener, 
redshirt David Porter, and converted defen- 
sive lineman Wally Bonnett should help. 

Phil Nevin is an offensive and defensive 
plus after being named all-Big West place- 
kicker in 1989 and punter last season, when 
he averaged 40.1 yards a kick. 

The top defender is senior linebacker Lor- 
enzo Hailey, who had a team-high 99 tackles. 
But there are new faces up front and in the 
secondary, where all four starters are gone 
from a unit that was burned for more than 300 
years per game. Rod Smith and Michael 
Jones will get first crack in the backfield. Chad 
Lindsay and Teddy McMillan are serviceable 
linebackers, while J.C. Farrow and Stan Bre- 
land lend some stability in the line. 0

Rocky Mountain football in general, and 
Brigham Young football in particular, 
face an unprecedented situation this fall: How 
do you react after you've won the Heisman 
Trophy? What do you do for an encore? Is it 
gauche to win it again? 

BYU's Ty Detmer became the first Rocky 
Mountain player in history to win the annual 
award as the nation’s outstanding football 
player when he outpolled Notre Dame's Rock- 
et Ismail in the 1990 balloting. Now, Detmer 
returns for his senior season to find out what 
life is like after winning the trophy, and to see 
about trying to become only the second two- 
time winner (after Ohio State's Archie Griffin) 
in Heisman history. 

In the face of wading into all this uncharted 
territory, Detmer and the Cougars have to be 
concerned about a continuation of what 
looked suspiciously like the beginning of a 
Heisman jinx at the end of last season, imme- 
diatey after Detmer won the award. No sooner 
did the announcement come fram New York 
than Detmer and BYU took the field in Honolu- 
lu against Hawaii and got blitzed, 59-28, in 
their last regular-season game. Then, in the 
Holiday Bowl in San Diego, they not only lost 
by another huge margin, 65-14 to Texas

A&M. but they also saw Detmer sidelined for 
the first time in his career with injuries to both 
of his shoulders. He had surgery on his throw- 
ing (right) shoulder in the offseason, and went 
throught extensive rehabilitation on both 
shoulders during the spring, missing practice 
as a result. His celebrated return to throwing 
came on, appropriately encugh, May Day. 


All reports label Detmer as good as new 
heading into the fall. He'll need to be. He'll not 
only be working behind a completely new fine 
and with an offense that features only three 
returning starters (counting himself). but hel 
also be teading the Cougars into the toughest

comes a game at UCLA. followed by a game 
at Penn State. and then the conference open- 
er in Provo against a strong Air Force team 
that beat Ohio State in the 1990 Liberty Bow! 
Each of those opponents has the potential to 
be in the nation’s top 20. 

By the end of September. Detmer will have 
either established himself as Archie Griffin's 
heir apparent, and the Cougars will have es- 
tablished themselves as a national champion 
contender, or they'll be wandering around 
Provo, wondering what happened and looking 
for an analyst. Whatever the case. the final 
eight games—with five of them at home and 
seven of them against familiar WAC victims— 
will seem like a holiday.

ning a league title and possibly a !-AA national 
championship as well.

conference 


AIR FORCE 

Coming off a 7-5 season is no big deal, but 
coming off a season that saw four victories in 
the last five games, capped by a 23-11 de- 
feat of Ohio State in the Liberty Bowl, is a big 
deal. With six offensive starters back, includ- 
ing wishbone-tested quarterback Rob Perez, 
the Academy is no tonger singing the loss-of- 
Dee-Dowis blues and is looking at the strong 
possibility of a formidable season and its first 
conference title since 1985. 

Perez, a senior, rounded into form as the 
Girector of the wishbone at the end of 1990, 
capping his season by winning MVP honors in 
the Liberty Bowl. Then, in spring practice, he 
set about adding a passing threat to the Air 
Force offense. Last fall, the Falcons failed to 
throw a single touchdown pass—the only 
such I-A school—but in the Blue-White spring 
game, Perez threw two touchdowns while 
completing 12 of 20 passes for 220 yards. 
Since the Falcons completed 30 of 90 passes 
for 386 yards for the entire 1990 season, Pe- 
fez’s spring effort raised some eyebrows, sug- 
gesting that coach Fisher DeBerry's plan to 
pass more than in the past and put some mys- 
tery back in the Falcons’ offense isn't just talk. 

Perez, playing behind a virtually intact of- 
fensive line (only one starter graduated), has 
plenty of option backs to turn to when the run- 
ning game takes the field. While no full-time 
starters return from 1990, Ron Gray, a starter 
in ‘89, is back after sitting out a season to 
rehabilitate his knee, and fullback Jason 
Jones, while not a starter last season, still led 
the team in rushing yards, with 598. Two soph- 
omore halfbacks, Wayne Young and Obasi 
Onuoha, have 40-yard dash times under 4.5 
and are expected to contribute. 

Replacing linebackers Brian Hill and J.T. 
Tokish, the team’s top two tacklers, won't be 
easy, but Vergil Simpson does return on the 
outside. The secondary is solid, though, with 
Carlton McDonald, Eldrick Hill, and Shannon 
Yates, a reputed big hitter, all returning. Mc- 
Donald had two interceptions against Ohio 
State in the Liberty Bowl and Yates was the 
team interception leader. 

One of the Academy's biggest offensive 
weapons figures to be place-kicker Joe 
Wood, a returning first-team all-WAC player 
whose field-goal percentage of 85.7 (12 of 14) 
last season set a single-season school re- 
cord. Senior Jason Christ led the conference 
in punting (42.6 yards). 


BRIGHAM YOUNG 

You'd think defending its WAC title would be a 
cinch for BYU and its returning Heisman Tro- 
phy quarterback, Ty Detmer. But graduation 
losses, injuries, and the schedule—in no par- 
ticular order—make 1991 a questionable sea- 
son for the Cougars. 

A visit to practice last spring was most re- 
vealing. Only eight starters were back from 
the 10-3 team, and only five of them physically 
participated in workouts. Chief among the no- 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


shows was Detmer, watching from the side- 
lines while healing the right shoulder he in- 
jured against Texas A&M in the Holiday Bowl. 
Also sitting out drills were finebacker Rocky 
Biegel (shoulder), the anchor of the defense, 
and cornerback Tony Crutchfield (knee). 

It's at linebacker where the Cougars are 
strongest. Three starters return: Biegel, Scott 
Giles, and Shad Hansen. Add part-time start- 
er Jared Leavilt to the list and the Cougars are 
solid in the middle. With a healed Crutchfield 
and weak safety Derwin Gray returning, the 
secondary is reasonably experienced as well. 
It's on the interior line, with no returning start- 
ers, that rebuilding is full-scale. 

As for the offense, Detmer can look to his 
fight and see guard Brian May, and that’s it for 
familiar faces. However, the retooled line may 
not be in bad shape because two mission re- 
turnees, Eli Herring and Mike Empey, have 
experience; because letterman Mike Jenkins, 
the WAC’s biggest player (375 pounds), may 
finally come into his own; and because coach 
LaVell Edwards was high on the talent level, if 
not the experience, after spring ball.

Receivers Micah Matsuzaki and Nati Valdez 
combined for 34 receptions from Detmer last 
year, and they'll be back. But since Detmer 
completed 361 passes, that doesn’t mean 
much. Replacing tight end Chris Smith and 
all-purpose back Matt Bellini are the chal- 
lenges. Fullback Peter Tuipulotu is the only 
backfield starter besides Detmer. 

Backing up Detmer will be incumbent un- 
derstudy Joe Evans, a senior, and redshirt 
freshman Ryan Hancock, a 93-MPH baseball 
pitcher who completed 10 of 23 passes in the 
spring game and then, a half hour later, struck 
out two in the last inning to get a save ina 
BYU-Adams State baseball game. Also, her- 
alded California high school quarterback 
John Walsh signed with the Cougars, who en- 
joyed a good recruiting season, adding Jamal 
Willis, the Nevada Player of the Year, and Mark 
Atuaia, the Hawaii Player of the Year. 


SAN DIEGO STATE 

Sure, Dan McGwire has gone to the NFL and 
the Aztecs still aren’t certain who's going to 
replace ail 6-feet-8 of him, but with 14 starters 
returning, including the indomitable wide re- 
ceiver Patrick Rowe, San Diego State isn’t ex- 
pected to crumble just because it has to break 
in a new quarterback. 

Rowe enters the season riding an NCAA- 
record nine consecutive games of at least 100 
yards receiving. With a favorable early sched- 
ule that includes home games against Long 
Beach State and Pacific, he could stretch the . 
mark to 11 before tougher tests at Air Force 
and against UCLA in San Diego. Rowe's * 
1,392 receiving yards were a WAC record last 
season, and his 126.5 yards per game led the 
nation. Before it's all over, he may state a 


_ Heisman case of his own. 


The problem will be in finding someone to 
throw to Rowe, as well as to the top five run- 
ning backs from last season, and to stand 
behind an offensive fine that returns all but 
one starter. There are worse positions to have 
to step into. In the spring, sophomore quarter- 
backs Cree Morris and David Lowery battled 
to: become the next McGwire, but without a 
conclusion. Morris backed up McGwire, a Se- 
attle first-round draftee, last season, and Low- 
ery backed up McGwire in 1989 before taking 
a redshirt season. ; 

A defense that yielded 36 points per league. 
game and ranked fast in both total and scor- 
ing defense, must be shored up. Local San 
Diego product Tyrone Morrison, a defensive 
end who transferred from Ohio State and sat 
out the season in 1990, could be one of the 
answers. But he injured his knee in the first 
day of contact in the spring, and didn’t prac- 
tice again. Another Ohio State transfer, safety 
Darrell Lewis, didn’t play in the spring either, 
because of hamstring problems. He could be 
an impact defender as well. Defensive backs 
Robert Griffith, Gary Taylor, and Damon Pieri 
and nose tackle Eric Duncan ali return with 
starting experience. 

In the kicking department, Andy Trakas, the 
WAC's leading scorer in 1990 with 9.73 points 
per game (fifth nationally), returns. in all, 27 of 
last year’s 44 players on the two-deep roster 


for ke a, 


91 


return. With a schedule that includes most of 
the WAC's expected strong teams (BYU, Col- 
orado State, and Wyoming) at home late in the 
season, the Aztecs should have ample time to 
find their next quarterback. 


COLORADO STATE 

Coming off its winningest season in history (9- 
4), its best-ever WAC record (6-1, second 
place behind BYU), and its first bow! appear- 
ance in 42 years (a 32-31 win over Oregon in 
the Freedom Bowl), Colorado State may have 
a few holes to fill, but it has no complaints. Two 
years into Earle Bruce's tenure and the atmo- 
sphere in Ft. Collins is at an all-time high. 

Since Bruce arrived on the scene, only a 
year removed from his well-publicized firing at 
Ohio State, the Rams have compiled a 14-9-1 
record overall (10-4 in conference games). 
Not sensational numbers in Columbus, per- 
haps, but in Ft. Collins they are unprecedent- 
ed. In 21 years of WAC membership prior to 
the Bruce years, the Rams had experienced 
just three winning conference marks. In the 
eight years before he came they were 20-44 
against league opponents, including 2-14 in 
1987 and 1988. About the only WAC problem 
Bruce’s Rams haven't been able to deal with 
is the one in Provo. Two of CSU's four confer- 
ence losses the past two years have been to 
BYU, and they haven't been close (42-7 in 
1988, 45-16 in 1989). Traditionally, BYU has 
always been a headache to the Rams. In 21 
WAC games, BYU leads the series 16-4-1. 

Bruce has 10 starters back from last year's 
bowl team. Kevin Verdugo will step in as the 
full-time starter at quarterback, after alternat- 
ing with Mike Giminez in 1990. Verdugo has 
started 11 games over the past two seasons. 
He'll have last year’s top receiver, Greg Pri- 
mus (56 receptions), back, as well as Brian 
Copeland, the WAC's rushing leader with 896 
yards on 169 carries. In all, the skill positions 
are well-manned. The line has holes to fill, but 
center Mike Padilla and guard Adam Whitmer 
are back, and tackle Jason Basso (6-6, 283) is 
surrounded by high expectations. 

The defense must be rebuilt with a com- 
pletely new front three, but the linebacking is 
solidly anchored by returning starters Kevin 
Lynch and Otis Hamilton. Cornerback Selwyn 
Jones, strong safety Robert Stratman, and 
weak safety Harlan Carroll are returning start- 
ers in a backfield that ranked second-best in 
the WAC against the pass, behind only BYU. 
And yet another corner, Sylvester Mabry, has 
extensive playing time to his credit. 


HAWAII 

After two years of posing as legitimate title 
contenders, only to finish third both times, Ha- 
waii is ina semi-rebuilding state. The Rainbow 
Warriors do have slotback and retum-man 
extraordinaire Jeff Sydner, whom they'll be 
touting for the Heisman Trophy, and they have 
experienced running back Jamal Farmer. 
They have six solid defensive starters return- 
ing as well, so it’s not out of the question that 
they could contend again this year as they 
break in a new quarterback for the departed 
Garrett Gabriel. 

But there is their annual problem to contend 
with: namely, how to win in the WAC when 
they're not at home. The last two seasons, 
when a first-ever WAC title was within their 
grasp, they went 0-2 and 1-3 on the mainland. 
Going 8-1-1 in Alcha Stadium was good but 


92 


not good enough. In 12 years as a WAC mem- 
ber, the Warriors have posted a 35-20-3 con- 
ference record in Honolulu and a 13-17 re- 
cord away from home. This year, there are 
road games at Wyoming, BYU, and Colorado 
State. If history is any indicator, they will be 
Hawaii's undoing. In addition, Hawaii plays at 
lowa and at San Jose State and entertains 
Notre Dame in a home game on November 
30. They're calling it the toughest schedule in 
school history. 

Coach Bob Wagner, 30-18-1 in four sea- 
sons, will again use his island variation of the 
run-and-shoot offense. To replace Gabriel, 
who left with 32 school records, Michael Car- 
ter emerged from spring practice as the likeli- 
est starter, with another sophomore, Ivin Jas- 
per, also in the running. Jasper is a better 
passer and Carter a stronger runner, and both 
could end up seeing a [ot of playing time. 

Sydner is the team’s showcase player. He 
led the WAC and was fifth nationally in 1990 in 
all-purpose running, with 163 yards per game. 
He had 390 rushing yards for the season, 820 


receiving yards, 483 punt-return and 265 kick- 
off-return yards. Then, too, there's Farmer, a 
junior who already has 1,650 rushing yards to 
his credit. The only negative is that his fresh- 
man totals of 986 yards and a 5.0 yards-per- 
Carry average were better than his sophomore 
totals of 665 yards and a 4.2 average. 

With tackles Akili Calhoun and Maa Tanu- 
vasa back up front, 1990 leading tackler Terry 
Whitaker anchoring the linebackers, and inter- 
ception leader Tony Pang-Kee back to head 
the secondary, the defense that ranked No. 1 
in the WAC iast season will have a good shot 
at defending that title. 


WYOMING 

There won't be a lot of coaches envying Joe 
Tiller’s position at Wyoming. Tiller is the man 
Wyoming has hired to replace head coach 
Paul Roach, who retired after. four seasons 
with a best-in-school-history record of 35-15, 
three bowl appearances, and two WAC titles. 
Not only does Tiller have that tegacy to live up 
to, he has to do it with an offense that returns 
only four starters and with a four-game losing 
streak that wound up the 1990 season. 

The ‘90 Cowboys were cruising along at 9-0 
until they ran into Colorado State, Brigham 
Young, Hawaii, and, in the Copper Bow!, Cali- 
formia. When the 9-4 dust had cleared, Roach 
announced he would step down, to concen- 
trate on his duties as Wyoming's athletic di- 


rector, and replaced himself with Tiller, 
Roach’'s top aide the past two seasons. 

Tiller has said he won't change Wyoming's 
system on either side of the ball, although the 
Pokes, because of their personnel, will go to 
more of a pass-oriented, one-back look than 
in the past. Quarterback Tom Corontzos is 
back for his senior year. His consistency is a 
key for the offense. At the skill positions, only 
wide receiver Robert Rivers is back as a stan- 
er. Running back Dwight Driver returns after a 
684-yard season in 1990, but he has to recov- 
er from knee surgery that kept him out of the 
Copper Bow!. Overall. there is plenty of depth 
at wide receiver, with Greg Brown and Ryan 
Yarborough other targets. 

A good spring by freshman defensive back 
Eric Edmond enabled the Cowboys to move 
Efrem Haymore from a corner position to safe- 
ty and opened up the entire secondary, where 
the Cowboys should be the strongest defen- 
sively, ted by ail-WAC first-teamer Paul Wal- 
lace. Replacing WAC Defensive Player of the 
Year Mitch Donahue at end will be the biggest 
challenge. If tackle Thomas Williams re- 
bounds from knee surgery that kept him out of 
the Copper Bowl, he could be a dominator. He 
had 11 sacks in 1990. 

Sean Fleming, a senior and three-year reg- 
ular, should contend for the national punting 
title. He averaged nearly 40 yards in 1990. 


UTAH 
You won't find a more enthusiastic coach than 
Utah's Ron McBride, now in his second sea- 
son. Bul as last year’s 4-7 Utes displayed. 


Ro 


enthusiasm can take you only so far. Plagued 
by a lack of depth, the Utes didn't start out the 
McBride era any better than they ended the 
Jim Fassel era. The Utes’ defense did improve 
under McBride—up to 81st in the country from 
the near last-place finishes in previous 
years—but the offense faded. A program that 
led the country one year and was constantly in 
the top 10 under Fassel faded to 79th in scor- 
ing offense and 73rd in total offense in 1990. 

Still, the Utes do return 15 starters—more 
than any team in the WAC. The eight defensive 
returnees, ted by all-WAC linebacker Anthony 
Davis, are secure at their positions. The offen- 
sive returnees, however, are not. A team that 
scored 19.5 points per game doesn't normally 
resist change. 

Mike Richmond. the quarterback who 
wrested the job away from Jason Woods late 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


in 1980, will be No. 1 going into fall drills, but 
he can expect pressure from junior-college 
redshirt transfer Frank Dolce. As for Woods, 
he'll take his 6-foot-5, 240-pound body and 
become the starting tight end. One position 
that will be secure is wide receiver, where ju- 
nior Bryan Rowley returns after a 28-catch, 
762-yard, five-touchdown season. His 27.2 
yards per-catch average was among the na- 
tional leaders. In the backfield, Steve Abrams 
(562 yards) returns and Charlie Brown, a her- 
alded recruit two years ago, has the speed 
and potential to become the big-play man the 
Utes have been lacking. 

After transferring from Spokane Falls Com- 
munity College, Davis made his presence felt 
immediately. En route to an all-league season, 


he racked up 10 tackles for minus yards, four 


sacks, one pass interception, 87 total tackles, 
and two WAC Defensive Player of the Week 
awards. He should see a lot of double-team- 
ing this season, but with ends Jimmy Bellamy 
and Keith Embray, tackle Dave Chaytors, and 
linebacker Pita Tonga all back as starters, Da- 
vis shouldn't be the only problem. In the sec- 
ondary, LaVon Edwards, a four-year starter, is 
the leading returnee, while Reggie Alston, a 
junior-college transfer, made a strong bid in 
the spring for a starting slot at free safety. 


UTEP 

After a slow start, third-year coach David Lee 
finally has some bodies surrounding him, in- 
cluding 14 returning starters, and optimism, 
relatively speaking, is on the rise in El Paso. 
There's a good chance the Miners, who were 
2-10 in Lee's first year and 3-8 last season, 
can continue their gradual move out of the 
doldrums. Still, anything more than four vic- 
tories is unlikely. 

Quarterback Mike Perez returns as the 
Starter. He should be much more composed 
after a year of getting ready. Certainly he'll be 
more composed than he was last year, when 
he was rushed into duty after the heralded 
Howard Grasser was injured. Perez will be at 
the controls of a new run-and-shoot offense, a 
change ordered by Lee because Perez is 
more of a scrambling, option-type quarter- 
back, and because it’s the kind of offense Lee 
has always preferred. 

Halfback Kenny Brown had a good spring 
and should be a factor in the new offense, as 
should slotbacks Larry Sims, back from a 


aE At 


STREET AND SMITH’S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


knee injury, and Ivory Durio, a Prop 48 player 
who sat out last season. To wide receiver 
Glenn Bishop comes the challenge to be the 
next Reggie Barrett. He should be adequate 
at least. In the kickoff-return department, Roy 
Ross returns after placing 12th in the nation, 
and first in the WAC, as a freshman, averaging 
25.42 yards per return. 

Linebackers Barron Wortham and Pete Shu- 
felt are back. They're the strength of a defense 
that includes four returning starters in the sec- 
ondary: cornerbacks O.T. Thomas and Otha 
West. strong safety Anthony Hooks, and free 
safety Fred Patterson. Among them, however, 
they only had eight interceptions in 1990 in the 
pass-happy WAC. 


NEW MEXICO 

New Mexico's 6-41 record the past five years 
under coach Mike Sheppard is only part of the 
story. Not only have the Lobos lost a lot of 
games, they've been unlucky. Losing close 
games has been their forte. In the past two 
years they've lost 10 games by a total of 39 
points. Last season, they lost 10 of 12 games, 
including four by a touchdown or less. 

So if the Lobos lose, at least they don’t al- 
ways lose big. School officials decided to 
award Sheppard with a three-year contract 
extension midway through last season, giving 
him enough time to at least catch up with the 
law of averages. 

There will be a lot of other catching up this 
year as well. Only Steve Slater and Brad Sulli- 
van return to the offensive line. In all, just eight 
regulars are back. Five new coaches have 


been brought in, including Dave Kragthorpe, 
the former Oregon State coach who was in 
charge of the offensive line at BYU when 
Sheppard first got into the profession. 

Surrounded by newcomers, Sheppard de- 
cided to change to a new offense. He'll depart 
from the pro-style passing attack he learned 
while a graduate assistant at BYU and will go 
to the run-and-shoot. At the controls will be 
one of three quarterbacks who left spring ball 
in a dead heat for the starting job. They in- 
clude Jeremy Leach, the long-time starter un- 
til late last season; Marcus Goodloe, who took 
the starting job from Leach; and Stoney Case, 
a redshirt freshman. 


The most stable position is place-kicking, 
where two-year starter Dave Margolis returns 
with a respectable 29-of-38 career field-goal 
mark. Margolis was good for 5-of-8 from be- 
yond 40 yards in 1990. Also returning is punt- 
er Troy Rossean and his 42.0-yard average. 

The Lobos face a severe schedule in their 
rebuilding season. They begin with three 
straight road games: UTEP, TCU, and Hawaii. 
They must play at Fresno State, and their WAC 
games in Albuquerque include three of the 
traditionally strongest teams in the league: Air 
Force, BYU, and Wyoming. :

IDAHO conference 


After a season that concluded with a heart- 
breaking, one-point loss to eventual |-AA 
champ Georgia Southern in the semifinals of 
the national tournament, Idaho comes into 
1990 with 13 returning starters, including the 
top wide receiver and the No. 2 running back 
in |-AA, a seven-game regular-season win- 
ning streak, and home games against the 
teams considered to give them the most trou- 
ble in the Big Sky race, namely Nevada, Mon- 
tana, and Boise State. The Vandals should win 
their fourth Big Sky title in five years. 

Coach John L. Smith, entering his third 
year, has Doug Nussmeier back at full 
strength at quarterback. Nussmeier was the 
starter through the first six games last season 
and then went down with a fractured ankle, 
allowing senior Steve Nolan to guide the team 
to within one game of the national title. Now, 
Nolan is graduated and Nussmeier is coming 
off an impressive spring, where he completed 
27 of 42 passes for three touchdowns in the 
Vandals’ season-ending scrimmage. His top 
receiver in that scrimmage was Yo Murphy, 
the Idaho Fails product who had seven 
catches for 152 yards. Murphy, a junior, will 
be counted on for plenty of offense but still 
figures to be an understudy to the team’s pre- 
mier receiver, Kasey Dunn. In 1990, Dunn was 
the No. 1 receiver in |-AA, with 88 catches, 
1,164 yards, and seven touchdowns. 

Nussmeier’s biggest problem will be trying 
to figure whether to throw to Dunn or Murphy 
or to hand off to Devon Pearce, the No. 2 rush- 
erin I-AA with 1,393 yards on 267 carries. He 
was at his best with a 226-yard day against 
Boise State when the Broncos were ranked 
second in the nation against the run. 

On the offensive line, sophomore tackle 
Jody Schnug retums with a reputation as a top- 
notch protector. Two other starters rejoin him, 
although Chris Schneider suffered a knee in- 
jury in the spring and had to have surgery. He 
is expected to be able to play, however. 

The offense will be the strength of the team 
early on, with non-league home games 
against Sonoma State and Southwest Texas 
available for tune-ups. Defensively, the Van- 
dals have more leaks to plug. Three starting 
linebackers and three key backs graduated. 
End Jeff Robinson does return after a 16- 
sack, three-interception season. 


NEVADA 

A new deck on the University of Nevada's 
Mackay Stadium has expanded seating ca- 
pacity to 26,000 and reflects the school’s foot- 
ball fortunes of late. The Wolf Pack ended the 
1980 season as the national tournament run- 
ner-up after a 36-13 loss at Georgia South- 
em. That game capped a 13-2 season that 


93 


gave Nevada its third Big Sky championship 
in the past eight years, and extended the 
school’s record since 1979 (coach Chris 
Ault's first year) to $9-45-1. Three All-Ameri- 
cas and two all-conference performers must 
be replaced, as well as six others. The hardest 
shoes to fill will be those of Treamelle Taylor, 
Nevada's big-play wide receiver. 

Quarterback Fred Gatlin is back, as well as 
his capable backup, Chris Vargas. It was Var- 
gas who played in every down of Nevada's 
seven overtime periods in three games in 
19930. The Wolf Pack won all three games (31- 
28 over Idaho in one overtime, 42-35 over 
Furman in three overtimes in the !-AA tourna- 
ment, and 59-52 over Boise State in yet an- 
other triple overtime in the I-AA semifinals). 
Also, starting running back Eric Smith returns, 
along with tight end Scott Benning. And the 
biggest answer to Taylor could be running 
back Jason Frierson, the Big Sky's leading 
tusher four games into 1990, when a blown 
knee knocked him out for the season. 

On the offensive line, only two official start- 
ers are back, but the injuries to linemen that 
looked like a curse at the beginning of 1990 
could end up being a blessing. Nevada is 
loaded with experience on the line. 

Defensively, inside linebacker Matt Clafton, 
the tackling leader for two years, and all- 
Big Sky cornerback Brock Marion are the 
strengths of a mostly experienced squad. 

The Wolf Pack will not ease gently into the 
season. They open September 7 in Mackay 
Stadium against I-A instate rival UNLV. 


BOISE STATE 

Once again, the Broncos head into the sea- 
son as legitimate conference championship 
contenders. That's nothing new. Since joining 
the Big Sky in 1971, Boise's records of 167- 
74-2, .691 (overall) and 69-43-1, .689 (confer- 
ence games) lead all other member schools. 
The Broncos have had a problem finishing the 
season No. 1 in the league, however. Not 
since 1980, when they won their fifth champi- 
onship in eight seasons, have they finished at 
the top. In 1990 their 6-2 league mark came 
within one game of Nevada's. An early-sea- 
son 16-10 loss to Eastern Washington haunt- 
ed them the rest of the year. 

This year's team is led by perennial all-Big 
Sky running back Chris Thomas and corner- 
back Frank Robinson. Thomas was named 
first-team all-league as both a sophomore and 
junior in 1989 and "80. He had 913 yards and 
eight touchdowns last season in addition to 
271 receiving yards and another touchdown, 
even though he was plagued by injuries. Rob- 
inson is a senior with pro potential. He had six 
interceptions in 1990, as well as a team-lead- 
ing 19 pass deflections. In addition, he re- 
tumed punts. In the offseason, he lettered for 
the Broncos basketball team for the second 
straight year. 

Replacing the graduated Mike Virden at 
quarterback will be Jeff Mladenich, a junior 
without experience. He won the position 
cleanly in the spring, though, and could terd 
his running abilities to give Boise more of an 
option look on offense. Tight end Larry 
Stayner and offensive tackle David Koch, both 
honorable mention ail-league a year ago, 
bring valuable experience, while strong safety 
Anthony Brown, with seven interceptions, is a 
capable complement for Robinson. 

The Broncos must play at Montana, Idaho, 


94 


and Nevada—three teams likely to battle them 
for the title. Only one other game all season~ 
with Weber State—is on the road, with seven 
games slated for Bronco Stadium. 


MONTANA STATE 

With 39 retuming fettermen, including 18 start- 
ers, seven of 11 games at home, and a dizzy- 
ing return man/wide receiver in Rob Tesch. 
Montana State could make a move into the Big 
Sky's upper division. 

The Bobcats can't say they don’t know the 
territory in the Big Sky. not with nine returning 
starters on both sides of the line. Offensively, 
that includes incumbent quarterback Joe Vo- 
lek, the engineer of iast season's three confer- 
ence victories over Idaho, Eastern Washing- 
ton, and Northern Arizona. Volek and the of- 
fense broke in a new controlled passing at- 
tack in '90 that brought the Bobcats out of 
their previous rushing-oriented mode. There 
were significant line breakdowns in ‘0 that 
should be more of a thing of the past this 
season. All five linemen return, including tack- 
les Ken Eiden and Mark Woodcock, guards 
Travis Annette and John Schlee, and center 
Marty Milton. 

Besides the dangerous Tesch at wide re- 
ceiver—he had 31 receptions for 538 yards, 
21 kickoff returns for 591 yards, and 10 punt 
returns for 130 yards in 1990 to rank 10th in 


the nation in all-purpose. yards—returnees at 
the skill positions include backs Clint Bryan, a 
big-play type who returned a kickoff 97 yards 
for a touchdown last season, and Si Ryan. 
Defensively, senior linebacker Todd Graves 
and senior tackle Corey Widmer are the lead- 
ers. Widmer was second-team All-America in 
1990, as well as the Big ie Defensive Player 
nd 17 sacks. 


Graves won all-league honors with 155 tack- 
tes and four blocked kicks. 

The Bobcats play three nonconterence 
games in Bozeman for starters (against Min- 
nesota-Duluth, Sam Houston State. and Sac- 
ramento State) before entertaining preseason 
Big Sky favorite Idaho in the fourth game of 
the year. To stast the season last year, Mon- 
tana State traveled to [daho and won, 27-24. 


MONTANA 

Lost in the shadow in 1990 as Nevada, Idaho. 
and Boise State all had big years, Montana, a 
preseason favorite, struggied to a less than 
expected 4-4 Big Sky record and 7-4 overall 
mark. Now it's coach Don Read's task to re- 
build most of his offense, which includes find- 
ing a replacement for quarterback Grady 
Bennett. who was dratted by the British Co- 
lumbia Lions of the CFL. and to maintain a 


STREET AND SMITHS COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


veteran defense (seven returning starters) 
that ranked third in the Big Sky overall in 1990 
and first against the run. 

Read looks forward to fielding perhaps the 
best defensive line he’s had in six years with 
the Grizzlies. The experience is three-deep at 
most spots. Gregg Smerker, Nels Kiudt, and 
Kirk Murphy are retuming starters. Free safety 
Sean Dorris, after an 83-tackle season, is the 
leader of the secondary. 

Three-year starter Chad Germer at center 
anchors an offensive line that, unlike the rest 
of the offense, is experienced. That's good 
news for Brad Lebo, the quarterback who will 
take Bennett's place. Lebo, a third-year soph- 
omore, remained in Bennett's shadow for two 
seasons and didn't play much. Read calls him 
“the most experienced inexperienced quar- 
terback around.” Marc Monestime returns as 
the team rushing leader (460 yards in 110 at- 
tempts), and is flanked by fellow starter Tony 
Rice. All-purpose threat Shannon Cabunoc, a 
5-foot-5 wide receiver, has big-play capabili- 
ty. He gained 1,313 total yards last season. 

The questions for the Grizzlies are whether 
they can rebound quickly after a lot of key 
personnel losses, whether they can shake off 
a relatively disappointing season, and wheth- 
er they can play well on the road in early 
games against perennial I-AA powers Louisi- 
ana Tech and McNeese State. They do play 
Boise State and Nevada at home, which is a 
plus, and their games against archrival Mon- 
tana State and league favorites Nevada and 
Idaho aren't until the end of the season, giving 
the new team a chance to round into form. 


EASTERN WASHINGTON 
Eastern Washington could be looking at its 
first upper-division finish since it joined the 
Big Sky Conference in 1987. The Eagles have 
finished eighth, eighth, fifth, and fifth, which 
suggests improvement. Now, coach Dick 
Zornes, whose lifetime record at EWU is 70- 
53-2, has 17 returning starters (second only to 
Montana State), his top three rushers back, 
and his top six receivers. Curiously, in spite of 
all this incumbency, the Eagles are nonethe- 
less rebuilding the bulk of both their offensive 
and defensive lines. The success of these re- 
building projects should have a lot of say in 
how well the Eagles finish the season. 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


One offensive lineman who is back is tackle 
Kevin Sargent, a second-team All-America 
selection a year ago. Center Jimmy Schmidt 
looks strong as a new player, and he'll be 
hiking to quarterback Mark Tenneson, back 
for his junior year after splitting time with the 
departed Scott Stuart. Flanker John Balmer 
(31 receptions, 399 yards) will be a chief tar- 
get, along with tight end Tony Lenseigne, the 
Big Sky's first-team tight end in 1990. At run- 
ning back is sophomore Harold Wright, after 
an 836-yard season and Big Sky Newcomer 
of the Year honors, alongside Tim Mitchell. 

On defense, cornerback Kurt Schulz is at 
the heart of things, flanked by a full backfield 
of starters that includes strong safety Bryan 
Boesel, free safety Robert Puller, and comer- 
back Jackie Kellogg. Two touted juco trans- 
fers, Tommy Williams and Derek Hart, could 
move aside some of the starters, however. 
Tackle Adam Kanouse (278) is the anchor of 
the line. The Eagles’ challenge is to shore up a 
defensive platoon that ranked seventh overall 
in the Big Sky and eighth against the pass. 


NORTHERN ARIZONA 

Coach Steve Axman comes into his second 
season with the Lumberjacks after putting the 
league on notice that there will be {ittle transi- 
tion in Flagstaff because of a new regime. Ax- 
man’s 1990 team, while predicted to finish in 
the basement, won three league games and 
went 5-6 overall. 

Now, with 14 starters returning, including 
quarterback John Bonds and wide receiver 
Hendricks Johnson, NAU is labeled at least 
legitimate, if not a first-division finalist. On pa- 
per, the Lumberjacks aren't in bad shape at 
all. Johnson alone makes them formidable. He 
barged onto the Big Sky scene last year as a 
junior-collége transfer by racking up 1,091 re- 
ceiving yards (second only to Idaho's Kasey 
Ounn), a nation-high 11 touchdowns, and set- 
ting a school record with 18.5 yards per catch. 
He ended the season with eight straight 100- 
yard receiving games, the second-longest 
such streak in I-AA history (exceeded only by 
Mississippi Valley's Jerry Rice, who had 12). 
Besides Bonds, who had 24 touchdowns and 
3,039 yards as a sophomore (and 24 inter- 
ceptions), the backfield returns halfback 
Charles McKinzie and tailback Gerald Robin- 
son, the rushing leader. 

End David Musselman heads the defense, 
along with three returning starters at lineback- 
er and in the secondary. While the seven re- 
turnees signify experience, a more sobering 
note is that NAU’s defense ranked last in the 
Big Sky in 1990, giving up an average of 468.2 
yards per game and yielding 48 touchdowns. 

Offensively, NAU ranked only sixth overall 
in the Big Sky in 1990. But what the Lumber- 
jacks lacked in statistics they made up for with 
an ability to win close games. Four of their five 
victories were by seven points or less. Their 
losses, on the other hand, included just one 
seven-pointer. The others were by 20, 33, 34, 
41, and 45 points. 


WEBER STATE 

It's rare to project a low second-division finish 
for a team with perhaps the best quarterback 
in t-AA. But just because the Wildcats have 
first-team All-America Jamie Martin doesn't 
cover up a defense that has just two returning 
starters, and an offense decimated by per- 
sonnel losses on the line. 


Martin, a 6-4, 210-pounder from Califomia, 
came into his own as a junior. He finished 
second in the Walter Payton Trophy balloting, 
signifying I-AA’s Player of the Year, after a 
season that saw him throw for 3,700 yards and 
23 touchdowns with just 15 interceptions. His 
quarterback rating of 143.2 ranked sixth in the 
country and his total offense of 337.5 yards 
per game ranked No. 1. His yards-per-play 
average was 7.31. As a result, Weber vaulted 
to the top of the Big Sky in total offense and 
passing as well as No. 1 in the nation in pass- 
ing. Along the way, the Wildcats improved 
coach Dave Arslanian's record after an open- 
ing 3-8 season in ‘89. They went 3-5 in the 
league and 5-6 overall. 7 

With Martin back, a potent offense is again 
possible. Although Martin's favorite target 
fram a year ago, Rick Justice, is gone, tight 


- end Trevor Shaw, who caught 65 passes, is 


back, as is wide receiver Jon Fuller, who had 
28 catches. Also, running back Geoff Mitchell, 
with 334 yards in '90, returns. On the line, 
tackle Bruce Covernton (290) is coming off an 
all-Big Sky and honorable mention All-Ameri- 
ca season. If Covernton and Russ Henrie, the 
other returning starter on the line, can round 
the newcomers around them into shape 
quickly, Martin could have decent protection. 

Defensively, there will be new faces virtually 
everywhere. Wilh its junior-college transfers 
not arriving until fall, Weber could have a num- 
ber of different defensive lineups in the early 
part of the season. The opening game, at Air 
Force, will be against a strong I-A program 
with a veteran secondary. After that, however, 
the schedule eases up, with four of the next 
five games at home. Nonconference oppo- 
nents, in addition to Air Force, include less 
than formidable Southern Utah University and 
New Mexico Highlands. 


IDAHO STATE 

One of the largest offensive lines in I-AA is the 
biggest cause for optimism in Pocatello. If 
Derek Farr (275), Reed Payne (285), Marcus 
Toliver (300), Todd Blackwell (275), and Tom 
Hebert (250)—grand total of 1,385 pounds— 
get ornery enough, maybe the offense of the 
Bengals can stay on the field long enough this 
season to win more shootouts than it loses. 

In coach Garth Hall's three years to date, 
the Bengals haven't been prolific enough of- 
fensively to overcome their defensive prob- 
lems, or lucky enough to win the close games 
(three more losses by less than a touchdown 
each in 1980). They're 6-26 in that span, with a 
ninth-place, a seventh-place, and a ninth- 
place Big Sky finish. They'll have a new quar- 
terback in Trevor Cavanaugh, taking over from 
long-time starter Jason Whitmer, maybe the 
best 6-26 quarterback in history. Last year, 
Whitmer directed an offense that ranked 25th 
in |-AA and 11th in passing. The problem was 
on the other side of the line, where ISU's de- 
fense gave up 435 yards and 32.6 points per 
game. Double tight-and returnees—who often 
play together—Pete Molino and Ted Oparnico 
should be offensive weapons. 

The defense has seven retuming starters, 
but most positions are not guaranteed, with 
the exception perhaps at one of the ends, 
where Lance Nazel, a second-team all-leagué 
selection, is a mainstay. Kicker Darren Good- 
man was honorable mention All-America in 
1990. He ranked third in !-AA with 1.8 field 
goals per game, hitting 20 of 28. D

A new era dawns in the Sunshine State 
this fall as Miami and Florida State shed 
their independence to join the conference 
ranks. Miami will aim to make the Big East 
bigger while Florida State plans to improve 
the Atlantic Coast Conference's growing foot- 
ball reputation. 

Though conference titles will be nice, ex- 
pect the Hurricanes and Seminoles to focus 
on that all-important state championship Usu- 
ally, the state champ has something to say 
about the national championship. This year's 
November 16 showdown at Tallahassee 
opens November Madness in Florida. The 
‘Canes meet the ‘Noles that day. Two weeks 
later, the Florida Gators host the ‘Noles. 

The Miami-FSU showdown promises to be 
as big as ever. This once gentlemanly rivalry 
grows more emotional! and important each 


year. The last time Miami vis:ted Doax Camp- 
bel! Stadium, the ‘Canes tried to stop the Sem- 
inole mascot from nding his horse to midfield 
and spiking a flaming spear :n a traditional 
pregame ceremony A brawl nearty broke out 
before the kickoff but FSU prevailed, 24-10 
Last year, FSU cornerback Terrell Buckley 
questioned quarterback Craig Erickscn's sta- 
tus as a Heisman candidate and FSU Ine- 
backer Kirk Carruthers called Erickson “aver- 
age." !t angered the ‘Canes. Even coach Den- 
nis Erickson was especially emotional. He 
leaped into his quanerback’s arms after Craig 
lobbed a touchdown pass over Buckley's 
head. Miami's quarterback was heard mutter- 
ing “Average?.. Average?’ as he left the field. 
Miami got its revenge, 31~22, and scuffled 
with the ‘Noles as the final seconds ticked off 
the Orange Bowl clock. 


STREET AND SMITHS COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


—~— 


Miami is going for its sixth consecutive top 
five finish this year. The ‘Noles bid for their fifth 
Straight. Still, Miami hasn't finished lower than 
No. 3 since 1985. FSU hasn't finished ahead 
of Miami in that time. The rivalry carries some 
extra baggage this year. The ‘Canes officially 
begin representing the Big East this fall. Con- 
ference officials are aiming at round-robin 
schedules by 1995 or '96 and were busy this 
summer looking for a bowl tie-in. The ‘Noles 
begin conference play in 1993 or ‘94. 

This could be the year of the Gator Get- 
Back in the Soulheastern Conference. Last 
year, even though the University of Florida fin- 
ished with the best record (6-1) in the SEC, the 
Gators were ineligible for the league champi- 
onship as part of sanctions for past NCAA 
tules violations. This season, Florida has a 
clean slate and a determined altitude, not to 
mention 12 starters from last year’s 9-2 sea- 
son, and should be the team to beat in the 
typically top-heavy SEC. Seven starters are 
back from last fall's wide-open “Fun and Gun" 
atlack that shattered 14 school records, in- 
cluding most points (35.2 per game) and 
passing yards (3,197) under offensive-mind- 
ed coach Steve Spurrier. Also back are five 
starters and a wealth of experienced reserves 
from a Gator unit that ranked fifth in the nation 
in total defense. 

Don't expect contenders Tennessee, Au- 
burn, and Alabama to concede the title. Ten- 
nessee, which represented the SEC in last 
season’s Sugar Bowl, returns 21 of 22 players 
from its two-deep defensive chart, along with 
several offensive standouts. If UT can pro- 
duce a quality running back, coach Johnny 
Majors’ Volunteers figure to be right in the 
thick of the fray. 

Although Auburn went 8-3-1 last season, 
coach Pat Oye felt something was missing 
from the “Auburn Way” of playing. When Dye 
gets peeved, opponents better beware. 


Alabama turned a horrid start into a hot fin- 
ish and second-year coach Gene Stallings 
appears to have his feet, and program, on 
solid ground and ready to turn the Tide. 

Georgia and LSU could be the SEC sleep- 
ers. Both programs had off seasons last fall, 
but there's too much tradition and support at 
both places for either to stay down for long. 
Each will be improved, and that improvement 
could be dramatic. 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


Mississippi suffered key losses, but the Re- 
bels have had some success and coach Billy 
Brewer appears to have established a solid 
foundation. The same applies at Kentucky, 
where coach Bill Curry’s program looks to be 
gaining momentum. Both Ole Miss and Ken- 
tucky, however, are dark-horse candidates in 
the title race. 

Long-suffering Mississippi State and Van- 
derbilt made head-coaching changes at the 
end of last season that could pay dividends in 
the future. This fall will be primarily devoted to 
rebuilding for the two schools.

FLORIDA STATE 
The last time the Seminoles were this loaded 
was 1988. Then they were everybody's pre- 
season No. 1 and strutting to their own rap 
song and video. The tune never made the top 
of the charts and neither did the ‘Noles. FSU 
was rapped, 31-0, by Miami in its opener that 
year. The Seminoles finished with a No. 3 
ranking after winning their next 11 in a row. 
Though FSU is stocked with the talent, 
speed, and experience needed to win a na- 
tiona! title, den’t expect to hear the ‘Noles 
singing their own praise. Coach Bobby Bow- 
den makes another run for that elusive first title 
with a strong start on his mind. “My No. 1 jobis 
to keep heads on straight,” Bowden said. “We

have most of the kids back, and we have not 
just talent but depth. My job is to keep them 
hungry. No letdowns, especially early.” 

The Seminoles open a rigorous schedule 
against Brigham Young and giant killer Ty 
Detmer in the Disneyland Pigskin Classic. 
Detmer knocked off preseason No. 1 Miami in 
the ‘Canes opener last year. It doesn’t get 
much easier afterward. FSU plays Michigan, 
Syracuse, LSU, Louisville, South Carolina, Mi- 


sive Backs: Standout senior Kirk caniiee 


ami, and Florida. “You simply can't peak every 
week,” Bowden said. “That's where you need 
alittle luck to go along with everything else.” 

The ‘Noles have almost everything else. 
They return eight starters on offense and nine 
on defense. The depth was so good that even 
All-America candidates Terrell Buckley and 
Marvin Jones were seriously pushed as start- 
ers. Senior quarterback Casey Weldon, who 
was 6-0 after winning the starting job at mid- 
season last year, leads a balanced offense. 
He was third in the nation in passing efficiency 
wiht 112 completions in 182 attempts for 
1,600 yards and 12 touchdowns with only four 
interceptions. Senior fullback Edgar Bennett 
returns as one of the nation’s best and most 
versatile backs. The All-America candidate 
was FSU's second-leading receiver with 35 
catches and rushed for 302 yards on 61 car- 
ties. Junior tailback Amp Lee will have his 
eyes on a 1,000-yard rushing season after 
gaining 825 a year ago. Talented sophomore 
Sean Jackson (7.9 yards per carry) will see 
much time as a backup. 

The receiving corps loses All-America Law- 
rence Dawsey but returns Matt Frier (10-226- 
1) and Shannon Baker (18-242-4) with Eric 
Turral and Ken Knox ready to rotate in. Warren 
Hart and Marvin Ferrell may alternate in trying 
to replace standout tight end Reggie John- 
son. The offensive line returns virtually intact. 
Tackie Kevin Mancini and guards Mike Morris 
and Reggie Dixon are back with center Rob- 
bie Baker. Robert Stevenson steps in as a 
first-year starter at tackle. 

It gets even better defensively. Six of the 
front seven remain with three of the four defen- 


returns with last year’s freshman sensation 
Jones as inside linebackers. Jones made an 
impact like no other first-year player at FSU, 
leading the team in tackles and showing 
promise as an all-star. Big-play senior Howard 
Dinkins returns at one outside linebacker with 
sophomore Sterling Palmer (6-7, 260) step- 
ping in with the promise of being another Ted 
Hendricks. Palmer's skills have prompted FSU 
coaches to consider slipping into the 4-3 de- 
fense with Palmer playing some end. Henry 
Ostaszewski, James Chaney, and Troy Sand- 
ers return to the interior front. Senior corner- 
back Buckley is back as one of the nation’s 
best cover men (six interceptions) and punt 
returners (14.6). Erroll McCorvey returns at 
the other corner with John Davis and Leon 
Fowler filling the safety roles. 

FSU's kicking game was unimpressive last 
year but returns John Wimberly (39.9) and 
Scottie McLaren (36.7) as punters with red- 
shirt freshman Dan Mowrey expected to win 
the place-kicking job. 


MIAMI 
The search for a worthy heir to Quarterback 
U's royal line of golden arms looms as a criti- 
cal challenge at Miami this fall. It's key to the 
Hurricanes quest to contend for another na- 
tional title. The football kingdom that pro- 
duced quarterbacks Jim Kelly, Bernie Kosar, 
Vinny Testaverde, Steve Walsh, and Craig 
Erickson opens fall practice with a starter yet 
to be named. The duel that raged through 
spring resumes in August between junior Gino 
Torretta and sophomore Bryan Fortay. 
“Whoever starts will be the next great quar- 
terback at the University of Miami," said 
coach Dennis Erickson, who closely guarded 
his assessments of the spirited duel through- 
out spring. “I'm sure we'll have a lot of people 
with opinions about who should start. That's 
fine. It makes it kind of fun, but the only opin- 
ion that matters is mine.” 


4 


Erickson pledges to make his choice two 
weeks before the season opener. Though 
Erickson called the position wide open enter- 
ing spring practice. Torretta stepped in with 
the unspoken edge because of his experi- 
ence. He was 3-1 as a starter when Craig 
Erickson was injuried during Miami's 1989 
championship season and holds the school 
record for passing yards in a game (468). For- 
tay, however, was one of Miami's most cele- 
brated recruits when he was signed out of 
New Jersey, and he showed much promise 
before breaking the middie finger of his throw- 
ing hand in the last week of spring. 

The new quarterback will inherit great ex- 
pectations. The ‘Canes finished with a 10-2 
record last year and No. 3 ranking after a 46-3 
romp against Texas in the Cotton Bowl. By 
Miami's lofty standards, it was a mediocre 
year. It was the ‘Canes lowest ranking since 
1985 and the first time they had lost two 
games in the regular season since 1984. Their 
high-flying one-back offense, which set a 
school record for total offense (482.9 yards 
per game), will be overhauled with only four 
starters retuming. The defense returns seven 
starters. UM's stiffest tests come at home 
against Houston and Penn State and on the 
toad against rival Florida State. 

Returning to lead the offense is junior tull- 
back Steve McGuire (621 yards rushing), a 
bruising back who could be Miami's best run- 
ner since Ottis Anderson. He’s out to become 


j usb 


only the second player in Miami history to rush 
tor 1,000 yards. Anderson did it in 1978. 
Sophomore Martin Patton complements 
McGuire with quickness. UM loses all-stars 
Randal Hill and Wesley Carroll and yet re- 
mains strong at receiver. Lanky junior Lamar 
Thomas (43-742-6) returns with a fleet-footed 
cast of newcomers: Darryi Spencer and Hor- 
ace Copeland and sophomore Kevin Wil- 
liams. The offensive line returns senior tackle 
Leon Searcy (6-3. 290). a candidate for All- 
America and Outland Trophy honors, and de- 
pendable senior guard Claude Jones. Ques- 
tions abound with the sest of fine and at tight

Miami's great void is its interior defensive 
line. The considerable talents of Outland Tro- 
phy winner Russell Maryland and Shane Curry 
are gone. Mark Caesar shows some skill at 
one tackle with the other lixely going to sopho- 
more Ken Lopez or Eric Miller. Anthony Ham-

ters Rusty Medearis ang Kevin Patrick rotating 
with Hamlet. 

Senior place-kicker Carlos Huerta, Miami's 
leading career scorer, returns as one of the 
nation’s best. Paul Snyder (36 5) is the punter. 


LOUISVILLE 
The days when Louisville made for a good 
homecoming opponent are tong gone. Coach 
Howard Schnellenberger’'s lofty ambitons—a 
national championship in Louisville?—don'’t 
seem $o Outrageous anymore. Not after the 
Cardinals throttled Alabama, 34-7, in last sea- 
son's Fiesta Bowl to finish No. 12 in the United 
Press International coaches poll 


STREET AND Staite S COLLEGE FOOTSALL 


The Cardinals (10-1-1) were soaring after 
the first 10-victory season in schoo! history. 
With Tennessee, Ohio State, and Florida State 
on the schedule this year, Louisville has a 
chance to vault to yet another level among the 
nation's elite. Schnellenberger is hopeful de- 
Spite losing 12 starters. “We will have greater 
depth, speed, and overall talent than we've 
ever had,” Schnellenberger said. "The kids 
will have to learn fast, but we will continue to 
match up with the top teams.” The Cards aim 
for their fourth straight winning season with 
Stiff tests early. They host Tennessee Septem- 
ber § in a Thursday night ESPN national tele- 
cast and then play at Ohio State September 
14. They host FSU on November 2. 

The offense will be retooled around a new 
quarterback. Jeff Brohm succeeds standout 
Browning Nagle. Louisville coaches are high 
on Brohm, who brings an added dimension to 
the pro-style attack with 4.5 speed in the 40- 
yard dash. An all-round talent who plays pro- 
fessional baseball in the Cleveland indians’ 
organization during the summer, Brohm com- 
pleted 29 of 55 passes for 482 yards with four 
touchdowns and four interceptions in limited 
action last year. 

The first freshman ever to lead Louisville in 
rushing returns with hopes of making an even 
bigger mark. Ralph Dawkins is back at full- 
back, where he rushed for 542 yards and five 
touchdowns. Curtis Lipsey is back after being 
the second-leading rusher a year ago, with 
340 yards. The top two receivers are gone, 
but Brohm will have one returning starter to 
throw to, senior flanker Fred Jones (23-400), 
and one familiar face, his brother, sophomore 
split end Greg Brohm (11-200). Tony Semak 
will likely start at tight end. 

The offensive line shows much promise de- 
spite returning only two starters. Tackle Kevin 
Blumeier anchors the unit with center Carey

pears to be decimated by graduation and the 
loss of tackle Ted Washington. Though only 
one starter returns, end Brian Hayes, there’s 
considerable experience. Young players like 
sophomore tackle Leonard Ray saw much ac- 
tion in reserve last year. Mel Mills will be at one 
end with Ron German at tackle. Andy Culley 
anchors the linebacking corps with sopho- 
mores Tom Cavallo and Ben Sumpter on the

outside. The secondary, a weakness in the 
past, ranks as a strength with three of four 
starters returning. Standout junior free safety 
Ray Buchanan and senior cornerback and all- 
star candidate William Blackford are back. 
Ricky McFadden returns at rover with sopho- 
more Kevin Gaines at the other corner. 

Louisville's kicking game should rank 
among the nation’s best with senior Klaus 
Wilmsmeyer returning as punter (42.9) and 
place-kicker (9 of 11 field goals). 


SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI 

The Golden Eagles soar into a new era with 
their “No Name” defense leading the way for 
first-year coach Jeff Bower. Southern Missis- 
sippi shook the old guard with a magical ‘90 
season that helped coach Curley Hallman 
earn the job as Mike Archer's successor at 
Louisiana State. Offensive coordinator Jeff 
Bower, a former Golden Eagles’ quarterback, 
was promoted to head coach before Southern 
Mississippi's 31-27 loss to North Carolina 
State in the All-America Bowl. 

The season-ending loss couldn't dampen 
spirits in Hattiesburg. The Golden Eagles fin- 
ished the regular season with an 8-3 mark that 
saw them upset Auburn and Alabama on the 
road. A field goa! that caromed off the goal 
post in the waning seconds prevented them 
for knocking off Georgia in Athens in an 18-17 
loss. Bower will try to conjure up the magic 
again without the man who waved USM’'s 
magic wand. Replacing big-play quarterback 
Brett Favre is a key. Bower's major task is 
making the offense more productive. The 
Golden Eagles ranked 102nd in total offense 
among 106 Division I-A teams last year even 
with Favre's clutch skills. 

Still, Bower has most of the “No Name” unit 
back that ranked fifth in scoring defense (12.8 
points per game). That defense will be tested 
early with USM's strongest competition com- 
ing in a four-game stretch against Pittsburgh, 
Colorado State, Louisville, and Auburn. 

Bower inherits a solid nucleus with 14 re- 
turning starters. Redshirt freshman Eric Estes 
has the edge in the race to succeed Favre. 
Still, he’s being pushed by two other redshirt 
freshmen: Honre Britton and Tommy Waters. 
Look for Southern Miss to add some option 
attack to complement their skills, 

USM'’s best offensive player is senior tail- 
back Tony Smith, also a dangerous punt and 
kick returner. He rushed for a team-leading 
657 yards a year ago and returned two punts 
for touchdowns. Fullback Roland Johnson 
and Dwayne Nelson return. Sophomore Mark 
Montgomery is the leading returning receiver 
in a unit that lacks big-play speed. Eric Wil- 
liams and Marcus Pope share tight-end du- 
ties. The offensive strength is a buriy line led 
by a pair of all-stars and four-year starters on 
the right side: tackle Chris Ryals (6-8, 280) 
and guard Chafan Marsh (6-0, 275). Senior 
guard Lehman Braley is back. 

The “No-Namers” figure to make names for 
themselves this year. The defense held oppo- 
nents to 14 points or fewer sight times in 90 
and returns mostly intact. Senior Arnie Wil- 
liams is at inside linebacker as the backbone 
of the defense. He, Rod Lynch, and Thad Mc- 
Dowell form an all-star interior. James Single- 
ton is a force at outside linebacker with Gerald 
Blake. The line is anchored by Donell Brannon 
and Pete Antoniou while the secondary re- 
tains safeties Gabe Peck and Brian Wood. 


The kicking game is solid with Scott Bryand 
(38.6) back as punter and Jim Taylor as 
place-kicker (15 of 26 field goals). 


SOUTHWESTERN LOUISIANA 
Southwestern-Louisiana will.unveil a new look 
in its quest to get back to its winning ways. 
The Ragin’ Cajuns’ run-and-shoot offense 
fired too many blanks as coach Nelson Stok- 
ley's team slumped to 5-6 last year. It was 
Stokley’s first losing season at USL in five 
years. Stokley is reworking his offense. “We'll 
still concentrate heavily on the option, and 
we'll throw it as much as we always have,” 
Stokley said. “I think we're going to be really 
solid.” The Ragin’ Cajuns will know quickly. A 
tough schedule sees USL, Wyoming, Arkan- 
sas, and Texas A&M in consecutive road 
games in September. They meet Auburn on 
the road in November, 

USL returns 11 starters. Questions abound 
offensively with the quarterback job open. 
James Freeman started nine games last year, 
passing for 1,332 yards and five touchdowns 
and rushing for 296 yards. Still, he’s being 
pushed by sophomore Tyjuan Hayes, who 
showed the knack for the big play while rush- 
ing for 371 yards, second among USL runners 
last year. Two newcomers compete for the 
tailback position: freshman Steve Mocek and 
Todd Thomas. Junior Damon Denaburg is 
back at fullback after leading the squad with 
440 yards. Meanwhile, Wayde Butler moves 
out of the backfield to join Charlie Forman as a 
receiver. Butler caught a team-leading 43 
passes last year. “We're going to try to get 
Wayde the ball in some more open-field situa- 
tions,” Stokley said. 

USL returns size and strength to the offen- 
sive front. Extra-large senior Louis Age (6-6, 
330) is at one tackle with Adam Johnson lining 
up beside him at guard. Roderick Tripp is 
back at one guard with transfer Kirk Cham- 
pagne at tackle and sophomore James Sell- 
ers at center. Sophomore Buck Moncla will 
Start at tight end. 

Defensively, the Ragin’ Cajuns have a 
strong nucleus of three leaders to retool 
around. James Atkins anchors the line with 
William Sims back at linebacker and Donald 
Collins at cornerback. Nose guard Terrance 
Matthews and linebacker Jonas Francois also 
return to prominent roles. 


GEORGIA SOUTHERN 

Tim Stowers answered the challenge of suc- 
ceeding the legendary Erk Russell at Georgia 
Southern by winning a national championship. 
When the Eagles defeated Nevada, 36-13, 
Stowers became the first coach in I-AA history 
to win the title in his first season. 

Stowers, 33, continues to build on what 
Russell created. The Eagles are dominating I- 
AA the way the Packers and Steelers used to 
rule the NFL. Georgia Souther bids for its 
third title in a row and fifth in the last seven 
years with 15 returning starters who helped 
the Eagles to a 12-3 record. 

“| said it last year," Stowers said. “It's hard 
to be hungry on a full stomach. Our defense 
will have to carry us again until we solve our 
quarterback and fullback situations,” 

The No. 1 challenge of spring was finding 
successors to quarterback Raymond Gross 
(44-8 as a starter) and All-America fullback 
Joe Ross (1,131 yards). The Eagles open fail 
with the quarterback job wide open. Albert

Huntley, Derrick McGrady, and freshman 
Charles Bostick are competing. Lester Efford 
(102-456-2) takes over for Ross with Darry! 
Hopkins (40-422-4) at slotback. Terrance Sor- 
tell (29-673-5) returns at receiver with Deryl 
Belser (26-467-2). The line retains four start- 
ers and features tackle Rex Nottage. 

Defensively, a trio of All-America candi- 
dates feads the way. End Steve Bussoletti an- 
chors the line with a knack for getting to the 
quarterback. He had 11 sacks last year. Cor- 
nerbacks Rodney Oglesby and Kevin Whitley 
are the strength of the secondary. Oglesby 
needs one interception to tie the school ca- 
reer record of 12. 


TULANE 

Tulane coach Greg Davis begins his fourth 
year with a stable of talented skill-position 
players returning, but the quest for his first 
winning season rests on finding a quarter- 
back to open the gates. The Green Wave 
struggled to a 4-7 mark last year but flashed 
the promise of a better future late in the sea- 
son. They upset bowl-bound Syracuse, 26- 
24, and nearly upset rival Louisiana State be- 
fore losing, 16-13. The effort took some of the 
sting out of a five-game losing streak. 

Soph Billy Duncan worked at quarterback 
this spring with Jerome Woods and redshirt 
freshman Paul Jetfords also vying. Retuming 
tohelp them are last year’s top six rushers and 
three of the four leading receivers. Five start- 
ers were expected to return to an offense led 
by what the Tulane sports information office 
hoped to bill as “Thunder and Lightning.” Full- 
back Chance Miller provided the boom last 
year with a team-leading 805 yards rushing 
while Terrance Strickland provided the flash 
with 1,259 all-purpose yards. A spring mis- 
hap, however, ruined that formula. Strickland 
injured his knee and underwent reconstruc- 


tive surgery. He will miss the season. That 
opens the door for talented junior backup Har- 
old Dennis. Jerry Ursin (44-548-3) returns as 
the leading receiver. His cousin, sophomore 
Will Ursin, and Steve Ballard step into the oth- 
er receiver spot. The offensive line rebuilds 
around its strength, senior center Charles 
Herrman, (6-3, 240). Sam Atkins returns at 
tackle. Brian Estep and sophomore Reggie 
Davis will start at guards with sophomore 
Brant Byrd moving in at a tackle. 

The remaking of the defense into a stan- 
dard 4-3 scheme with a pair of inside line- 
backers focuses on rebuilding that lineback- 
ing corps. Davis's first step in filling it was 
moving Ray Benford from end to middle fine- 


100 


backer. Sophomore Shane Wiegand will be 
the weakside linebacker. Sophomore Ruffin 
Hamilton starts on the strong side. The line 
features two returning starters: tackle Ronnie 
Clement and end Michael! Batiste. Kevin 
Jantschek will start at the other tackle with 
Darren McGowan at the other end. The sec- 
ondary retums its leader, junior Mark Thomhill 
at one safety. Freshman Mike Staid and Jon 
Pau! Martin compete for the other safety. Rod 
McDowell and sophomore Wilbert Gilmore vie 
at one corner with soph Brandon Hamilton at 
the other comer. Clark handles the punting 
(38.1) with Gary Butler (7 of 12 field goals) 
looking to improve at place-kicker. 


MEMPHIS STATE 

Third-year coach Chuck Stobart looks ready 
to make the big leap in the rebuilding program 
at Memphis State. He was thrust into a mess 
just a month before the 1989 season when he 
was hired to replace Charlie Bailey, who re- 
signed amid an NCAA investigation. Stobart 
struggled to 2-9, improving last year to 4-6-1. 
He returns a young but veteran cast of eight 
starters on offense and six on defense. 

Quarterback Keith Benton, who led the 
team in rushing last year with 612 yards, re- 
turns as a senior. He threw for 1,265 yards 
with seven touchdowns and 11 interceptions 
in 1980. Leon Bosby (156-589-4) is back at 
fullback with sophomore Larry Porter (114- 
468-9) at tailback. Russell Copeland (33-684- 
4) is an all-star receiving candidate. The line 
returns center Larry Bolton and guards Joe 
Stanley and James Maclin. 

The defense is solid up front with ends Ke- 
vin Jordan and Jeff Sawyer, tackle Chris 
Hobbs, and nose guard Pat Jansen. Mike Da- 
vis anchors the linebacking corps with sopho- 
more Jeremy Williams providing stability in the 
secondary al free safety.

CENTRAL FLORIDA 

Central Florida jumped boldly from Division Il 
to !-AA last year and enjoyed immediate suc- 
cess with a playoff berth. It didn’t end there. 
The Knights knocked off Youngstown State 
and William & Mary before losing to eventual 
!-AA champion Georgia Southern in the semi- 
finals. Coach Gene McDowell's Knights hope 
to improve upon last year’s 10—4 overall mark 
with another action-packed offense. UCF 
scored 31.7 points per game. 

The offense revolves around senior quarter- 
back Ron Johnson. He threw for 1,319 yards. 
completing 62 percent of his passes with 11 
touchdowns. Still, only one starter in the line 
retums, tackle Alex Goforth. Gone is the lead- 


ing rusher, Mark Giacone, the only Central 
Florida back ever to rush for 1.000 yards. Also 
gone are the top two receivers, Sean Beckton 
and Shawn Jefferson. Promising junior Willie 
English returns after rushing for 751 yards and 
a team-leading 13 touchdowns. Sophomore 
Pat Stewart also returns to the backfield with 
redshirt freshman David Rhodes expected to 
be the top receiver. 

Defensively, a pair of All-America lineback- 
er Candidates lead the way. Bob Spitulski had 
a team-high 13 sacks a year ago. Rick Hamil- 
ton led the squad in tackles. Tackle Bob Knott 
figures to provide help. 


WESTERN KENTUCKY 

The Hilltoppers will be looking to shake the 
miserable memories of last year's tumble to 
2-8 and rekindle memories of their playoff 
days. After opening the 1990 season with a 
pair of victories, Western Kentucky fost eight 
Straight in a stretch that was among the na- 
tion's toughest I-AA schedules. The Hilltop- 
pers look to rebound and return to the playoffs 
for the first time since 1988. 

Acast of 15 returning starters promises bet- 
ter things to come. Still, a major question 
looms with fall opening Who will replace 
quarterback Scott Campbell? Coach Jack 
Harbaugh will choose between a pro-style 
passer and an option quarterback. Brian 
Browning, a drop-back passer, looked good 
in the spring but is being pushed by a pair of 
option quarterbacks: freshman Jarius Mal- 
come and sophomore Eddie Thompson 

The fine should be a strength with four se- 
nior starters back. All-America candidate Guy 
Earle (6-5, 275) and Max Woods are at tack- 
les with guards David Browning and Robert 
Tyter. Herb Davis (140-657) should enjoy run- 
ning behind that line. He had two 100-yard 
games a year ago as a backup. The receiving 


corps is led by Dwayne Haun (31-459-3) and 
tight end Milton Biggins. 

Defensivety, a pair of senior All-Amenca 
candidates tead the way: tackle Brian Canoy 
(6-3, 260) and end Anthony Cooper (6-6. 
245). Three other seniors are key: nose guard 
Tony Gamer, end Richard Grice. and free 
safety Larry Harris. Strong safety Joe Lee 
Johnson is the top returning tackler. 

Steve Donisi returns as the place-kicker (11 
of 17 fieid goals). 


SAMFORD 

The Bulidogs will be looking to unleash a more 
wide-open offense as coach Terry Bowden 
bids for a second straight winning season with 


STREET AND SMITH S COLLEGE FOOTEALL 


18 starters returning. Samford improved to 6- 
4-1 last year, its first winning campaign since 
jumping to Division |-AA four year ago. Still, 
the challenge comes in six road games. 

Sophomore quarterback Ben Wiggins, a 
backup who threw for 657 yards last year, will 
be looking for a pair of all-star receivers. Brian 
James caught 46 passes for 963 yards and 
six touchdowns as a deep threat. J.C. Roper 
had 36 catches as a possession receiver. Se- 
nior tackle Chip Money (6—4, 263) may be the 
offense's best player. 

Defensively, nose guard Charles Buford an- 
chors the front with Ollie Sanders and Henry 
Thomas teaming with sophomore Tory James 
as a formidable linebacker corps. Cornerback 
David Primus leads the secondary.

FLORIDA 
Optimism is bubbling, in the wake of last sea- 
son's 9-2 record and 6-1 SEC finish, with 12 
starters returning: seven on offense and five 
on defense. “We need to continue to improve 
as a team and to develop the depth you need 
to compete week after week against the 
schedule we play,” said coach Steve Spurrier, 
in his second season at his alma mater. 

The Gators’ offense figures to be explosive 
again. Last season, Florida averaged 452.6 
yards per game in total offense, the best in 
school history and 10th-best in the nation. The 


points per game (35.2) and passing yards 
(3,197). They averaged 290 yards passing 
per game, the third-best single-season total in 
SEC history and ninth-best in the nation. Back 
at the controls is junior quarterback Shane 
Matthews, named the SEC Player of the Year 
by various publications. Matthews threw for 
2,952 yards, best in school history and sec- 
ond-best in SEC history. 

Also returning is the complete running-back 
corps, paced by senior Willie McClendon and 
Errict Rhett. McClendon rushed for 613 yards 


and seven touchdowns while Rhett, amember . 


of the SEC all-freshman team, led the Gators 
with 845 yards and four touchdowns. Both 
can also catch the ball: McClendon had 27

receptions, Rhett 22. At fullback, senior Dex- 
ter McNabb will battle for a starting job with 
sophomore Kelvin Randolph. Florida fost its 


top three receivers but has an impressive ar- - 


ray of replacements in tight ends Greg Keller 
and Terrell Jackson, while Tre Everett leads a 
long list of wideout candidates, Four starters 
are back in the offensive line, headed by all- 
SEC center Cal Dixon and standout tackle 
Mark White. They'll be rejoined by guard He- 
sham Ismail and tackle Tony Rowell. 

Defensively, Florida returns standouts Brad 
Culpepper and Mike Brandon in the line and 
senior Tim Paulk at inside linebacker. Ephe- 
sians Bartley returns at outside linebacker, 
where he recorded 65 tackles last season. 
Cornerbacks include De! Speer and free safe- 
ty is nailed down by junior Will White, who 
tanked second in the nation last year in inter- 
ceptions, with seven. 

Arden Czyzewski will handle the place-kick- 
ing duties. He also did some punting last sea- 
son, but highly touted signee Shayne Edge is 
expected to assume that responsibility. 


TENNESSEE 

The Vols return a nearly intact defense along 
with some key offensive stars from last sea- 
son's SEC co-champions, and coach Johnny 
Majors‘ team could find itself back in the thick 
of the chase again. “We lose some great play- 
ers,” said Majors, “but we also get some great 
ones back. We have the ability to challenge 
for another championship.”

There is reason for optimism, as UT returns 
21 of 22 lwo-deep players on a defense that 
tanked seventh nationally last season. One of 
the most dominant defenders figures to be 
senior free safety Dale Carter, who was also a 
standout kick returner, Cornerback Jeremy 
Lincoin, a big-play specialist, adds to a pow- 
erful secondary. Earnest Fields, Darryl Hardy, 
and Shon Walker were the top three tacklers, 
continuing Tennessee's legendary linebacker 
tradition, Chris Mims and Chuck Smith bring 
strength and quickness to defensive end.

Tackles Carey Bailey and Tom Fuhler will bat- 
tle with Shazzon Bradley. 

Offensively, UT can trot out two of the most 
exciting players in the SEC in quarterback 
Andy Kelly and receiver Cari Pickens. Kelly, a 
6-3, 211-pound senior, completed 59 percent 
of his passes last season. He earned a reputa- 
tion for pulling games out of the fire, epito- 
mized by a desperately dramatic drive that 
resulted in a 23-22 Sugar Bowl victory over 
Virginia with less than two minutes to play. 
Kelly couldn't have a more reliable target than 
Pickens, who caught 53 passes for 917 yards 
and six touchdowns. 

The Vols have to plug numerous backfield 
holes, the most notable left by Chuck Webb. 
Injured early last season, Webb would have 
been a Heisman Trophy candidate this sea- 
son but opted instead to skip to the pros. Also 
gone is all-SEC tailback Tony Thompson. Ta- 
vio Henson and Tracy Smith must prove them- 
selves at tailback, as must Kenneth Campbell 
at fullback. The offensive line was hard hit by 
graduation but retains center John Fisher, an 
all-conference prospect, along with veteran 
guard Tom Myslinski. Von Reeves and Mark 
Adams will likely split time at tight end. 

Joey Chapman, whose 41.9-yard average 
made him all-SEC, is back as punter. He'll 
also challenge for the place-kicking job. 


AUBURN 
The Tigers return 53 lettermen from last year's 
8-3-1 squad, including 11 starters. Coach Pat 
Dye said he is “looking at changing our de- 
fense and changing our defensive personality 
a little bit. We need to be a more aggressive, 


“n 


penetrating-type defense that will be able to 
create a better pass rush and still be able to 
stop the run.” 

Stan White, who started every game as a 
true freshman, will be back at the controls this 
fall. White completed 180 of 338 passes for 
2,242 yards and 14 touchdowns. The passing 
total ranks sixth on Auburn's career list and 
was the third-best single-season performance 
in schoo} history. White has an experienced 
line to Operate behind: center Bob Meeks, 
guard Tim Tillman, and tackle Chris Gray. 
Tight end Victor Hall is also a returning starter. 

Challenging for the tailback job will be Alex 
Smith and Darrell Williams. Among the full- 
back candidates are Teapot Brown, Reid 
McMilion, Chad Muilenburg, and Tony Rich- 
ardson. Among the Tigers’ wide-receiver 
prospects are Herbert Casey, Pedro Cherry, 
and Melvin Hines. 

Defensively, starting linebackers Jason 
Merchant, Reggie Barlow, Darrell Crawford, 
and James Willis are all back, along with nose 
guard Walter Tate and cornerback Corey Bar- 
low. Tate (6-2, 306) was one of the team's top 
tacklers, with 72, including 42 solos. Line help

could come from Richard Shea and Jon Wil- 
son. In the secondary, Barlow will team with 
Chris Jones, Clarence Morton, Corey Lewis, 
and Michale Pina. Lewis could also find him- 
self in the quarterback picture 

Jim von Wyl will be back to handle place- 
kicking duties. Dye has mace improving the 
kicking game one of his top priorities this fall. 
“Of all the parts of our football team last year, 
the kicking game has to stand out in my mind 
as the biggest problem we had,” he said 


ALABAMA 

Coming up with a quarterback ranks at the top 
of coach Gene Stallings’ wish list, with the job 
apparently up for grabs between senior Dan- 
ny Woodson and redshirt freshman Jay Bark- 
er. Woodson, who saw no varsity action as a 
freshman or sophomore, last Season compliet- 
ed 11 passes for 66 yards and ran 21 times for 
96 yards as a backup to two-year starter Gary 
Hollingsworth. “Finding a quarterback and re- 
placing the right side of our line is our most 
pressing issue." said Stallings, who turned a 
slow start (0-3) into a strong finish (7-5) in his 
first season at his alma mater.

Whoever wins the quarterback sweep- 
stakes will inherit a well-stocked backfield. 
Running back Chris Anderson and fullback 
Kevin Turner are returning starters, with a 
wealth of proven backups at both positions. 
Heading the list is Siran Stacy, an all-confer- 
ence performer two years ago who was in- 
jured last season, and Tarrant Lynch. Al- 
though the offensive line was hard hit by grad- 
uation, the Tide gets back two solid perform- 
ers in tackle Matt Hammond and guard 
William Barger. Alabama is deep and proven 
at receiver, where the injured Prince Wimbley 
and Craig Sanderson will rejoin starting tight 
end Steve Busky and flanker Donnie Finkley. 

The strength of the Crimson Tide should 
once again be its defense, which returns sev- 
en starters from the unit that was ranked in the 
top six in four NCAA categories. Nose guard 
Robert Stewart will anchor the line, while all 
three starting linebackers are back: Steve 
Webb, John Sullins, and Derrick Oden. Sullins 
and Oden were the top tacklers. Bama has 
quality depth at linebacker, starting with Anto- 
nio London, Byron Sneed, and Chris Cochran. 
Three starters are back in the secondary: cor- 
ners George Teague and Mark McMillian and 
strong safely Stacy Harrison. 

Punter Tank Williamson, who averaged 39.9 
yares per kick, returns for his final year. A 
replacement must be found for All-America 
place-kicker Phillip Doyle. Alabama will play 
on a new natural turf in Bryant-Denny Stadium 
this season. 


GEORGIA 

Coach Ray Goff believes his luck has only one 
way to go this season: up. Last year, between 
spring and the first game, the Bulldogs lost 
nine defensive linemen, a starting receiver, 
linebacker, and two safeties. Now, after three 
good recruiting seasons, Goff believes some 
positive results are at hand. 

Three quarterbacks who all have starting 
experience will contend for the job: Greg Tal- 
ley, Preston Jones, and sophomore Joe Du- 
pree, who was listed at the top of the depth 
chart entering spring practice. SEC Freshman 
of the Year Andre Hastings is back at wide 
receiver, along with senior flanker Kevin Max- 
well. Arthur Marshall, who missed last season 
with a leg injury, brings quality depth to wide 
receiver. All-freshman Shannon Mitchell lines 
up at tight end. 

The Dawgs’ top two rushers return, in soph 
Garrison Hearst and Larry Ware. They com- 


bined for over 1,300 yards last season. Mack ®

starting punter and place-kicker. 

Chad Loup, a sophomore quarterback who 
started six of 11 games last season and saw 
action in four others, will draw on that experi- 
ence to contend for the starting job this fall.

the final three games, is back and healthy. 
Sophomore flanker Marcus Carter, who be- 
came the team’s primary receiver after Kin- 
chen’s exit, caught 24 passes, four for TDs. 
Finding a backfield replacement for tail- 
back Harvey Williams would appear to be 
LSU's main offensive concern, but the team is 
well-stocked with runners. Fullback Sammy 
Seamster returns, along with lettermen Derek 
Pope, Darrell Williams, and Germaine Wil- 
liams. With the exception of center, the entire 
offensive line is intact: tackles Kevin Mawae 
and Andy Martin, guards Darron Landry and 
Frank Godfrey, and tight end Harold Bishop 
all were starters at the end of the season. 
- Senior nose guard Scott Wharton, who has 
Started 29 of the last 31 games, anchors the 
defensive line. The Tigers also field two pow- 
erful tackles in John Morgan (6-5, 270) and 
Marc Boutte (6-4, 260), who recorded 51 solo 
tackles last season and six quarterback 
sacks. A pair of outside linebackers, Roovel- 
roe Swan and Mike Hewitt, are coming off a 
good freshman season. Also back are line- 
backers Anthony Williams and David Walkup. 
The secondary is led by strong safety Der- 
riel McCorvey, one of the team’s leading tack- 
lers, and sophomore weak safety Anthony 
Marshall. LSU likewise has experienced cor- 
nerbacks in Wayne Williams and Ray Adams. 
Place-kicker Pedro Suarez and punter Brian 
Griffith return. Griffith ranked second in the 
SEC ast season with a 41.6-yard average, 
good for 20th in the nation. Accuracy was also 
one of Griffith's specialties. He dropped 18 
punts inside the opponents’ 20-yard-line. 


MISSISSIPPI 
Replacing Randy Baldwin, who would have 
been one of the SEC's top runners this fall, is 
the first order of business for Rebels’ coach 
Billy Brewer. Baldwin passed up his final year 
of eligibility at Ole Miss to enter the pro ranks. 
“Anytime you lose an all-conference running 
back like Randy Baldwin, it hurts,” said Brew- 
er. “He was the first one we've had around 
here in a while and we've obviously got a diffi- 
cult task replacing him. I'm anxious to see who 
steps forward.” Among the candidates is se- 
nior Tyrone Ashley, who played defensive 
back last season and also led the team in kick 
returns with 12 for 295 yards. Sophomore Dar- 
ron Billings will also get his share of carries. 
Quarterback Tom Luke, who earned a start- 
ing job early last season and guided the team

to five of its victories, played baseball this 
spring and will have to work his way back up 
the depth chart in the fall. Luke will challenge 
fellow junior Russ Shows for the starting job. 
Steve Davis is also in the picture. Vincent 
Brownlee, who ran for 301 yards and four 
touchdowns, is back at flanker, along with the 
Rebels’ top passing target, Darrick Owens. 
Tyrone Montgomery, who missed much of last 
season with a knee injury, returns. Tyji Arm- 
strong (6-4, 245) gives Ole Miss a solid tight 
end. Center Cliff Dew anchors the line. 

The defensive line features four seniors and 
a junior, with Tony Hervey (6-5. 295) supply- 
ing the beef at left tackle. Gary Abide and 
Pete Harris head the depth chart at lineback- 
er. Harris is the team’s leading returning tack- 
ler, third last season with 95. Danny Boyd and 
Chauncey Godwin are tested cornerbacks 
and Jeff Carter is solid at free safet 


Richard Chisolm, a junior-college transfer, 
is the leading candidate for the punting job. 
Another JC transfer, John Ross, could battle 
Brian Lee as the place-kicker. 

“This team has yet to feel its potential,” said 
Brewer, “We have a number of inexperienced 
players at a number of positions. But if we can 
hoid on and enjoy some early success, we 
have a chance to again be competitive.” 


KENTUCKY 

Coach Bill Curry nas a pleasant problem as he 
plunges into his second season with the Wild- 
cats: picking a starting quarterback out of a 
flock of prime candidates. Senior Freddie 
Maggard last season completed 109 of 188 
passes for 1.051 yards and six touchdowns 
with one interception—not baa statistics. Nev- 
ertheless, Maggard has to protect his starting 
job from a pair of juniors, Brad Smith and Ryan 
Hockman. Making the quarterback battle 
even more intense is the presence of a pair of 
talented freshmen, Mike Kinney and Pookie 
Jones. Maggard, who started 18 of the last 22 
games for the Wildcats, underwent offseason 
surgery on a shoulder and was slowed during 
the spring, but he is expected to be fully re- 
covered by the fall. 

The Wildcats may need all the arms they 
can muster if last season's wide-open passing 
attack is an indication of things to come. Ken- 
tucky set a single-season record for passes 
attempted (390) and completed (216). The re- 
sulting 2.152 yards were the second-highest 
passing total in UK history. Kentucky returns

line appears solid, with Chuck Bradley, Todd 
Perry, Matt Branum, and Jody Matthews. Four 
defensive line starters are also back: nose 
guard Joey Couch, end Derrick Thomas, and 
tackles Dean Wells and Jerry Bell. Five of the 
top six defensive backs return, including start- 
ers Larry Jackson, Brad Armstead, and Ster- 
ling Ward. The Wildcats will be testing some 
new linebacker candidates; Marty Moore and 
Reggie Smith are the most seasoned. 


MISSISSIPPI STATE 
New head coach Jackie Sherrill has 13 return- 
ing starters around whom he can start his re- 
building: seven on offense, five on defense, 
and one kicking specialist. 

One of the first items on the agenda of Sher- 
rill and his new offensive coordinator Watson 
Brown, who served as head coach at Vander- 
bilt for the past five years, is settling on a start- 
ing quarterback. The two top candidates are 
junior William Robinson and sophomore Todd 
Jordan. The Bulldogs have some experience 
in the offensive line: Guard Shea Bell and 
tackles John James and Kenny Stewart all 
were starters at the end of last season, along 
with tight end Trenell Edwards. James (6-3, 
281), a sophomore, is considered among the 
top lineman. Also back are starting wide re- 
ceiver Chris Firle, who will be challenged by 
Willie Harris, and running back Tay Galloway. 
Kenny Roberts and freshmen Chris Washing- 
ton and Michael Davis add backfield depth. 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


Chris Gardner and Tom Burke will compete 
for the place-kicking job. Senior Mike Riley is 
expected to handle the punting duties. Marc 
Woodard, Torrance Brown, and Daniei Boyd 
retum at linebacker. Lee Lipscomb is back at 
cornerback. 


VANDERBILT 
Filling defensive gaps that leaked a schcol- 
record 457 points last season (41.5 per game) 
is the first order of business for new Commo- 
dore coach Gerry DiNardo. “We must make 
drastic improvement on defense," said DiN- 
ardo, who came to Vandy from Colorado, 
where he served as offensive coordinator and 
was credited for much of the team’s national 
championship success. “Defense is one of 
our biggest challenges. A lot of our decisions 
will be based on improving our defense.” 
Vanderbilt returns eight offensive and 10 
defensive starters, all-SEC punter David Law- 
rence, and place-kicker Jeff Owen. DiNardo 
will install the “l-Bone offense" he made fa- 
mous at Colorado. It combines elements of 
the I-formation and the wishbone. “Our of- 
fense will be a ground attack that emphasizes 
ball contro! and field position,” he said. 
Redshirt juniors Marcus Wilson and Mike 
Healey, who shared the quarterbacking du- 
ties last season, will compete for a starting job 
this fall. Kevin Brothen, the strongest player 
on the team and a potential all-conference 
center, anchors the offensive line. Fullback 
Carlos Thomas, who has led the team in rush- 
ing the past two seasons, will be trying to 
make it three in a row. Vanderbilt, whose wish- 
bone attack led the SEC in rushing last season 


(2.498 yards), may lose versatile senior tail- 
back Corey Harris to the defense. Harris, who 
averaged 6.2 yards a carry and also caught 
19 passes for 341 yards and a touchdown, 
has asked to be given a shot at cornerback. 
Clarence Sevillian, who caught 29 passes for 
536 yards, will open at wide receiver. 
Defensively, sophomore linebacker Shelton 
Quarles figures to be one of the Commodore 
leaders. He led ithe team in tackles. Backs 
Robert Davis and Aaron Smith were members 
of the SEC ail-freshman team. Rod Keith, who 
tanked second in tackles in '90, is back for his 
third consecutive year as a starter at one end, 
with Alan Young at the other. Mike Gandolfo, 
perhaps the team's most spirited player, lines 
up at nose guard. a)

Major independents in the East have 

tried unsuccesstully over a period of 
some 40 years to form an all-sports confer- 
ence. Last winter they finally settled on the 
next best thing a Division I-A football align- 
ment as an integral part of the basketball-rich 
Big East. West Virginia, Rutgers. and Temple 
were invited to join Syracuse, Pittsburgh, and 
Boston College. already full-fiedged Big East 
members. And to make it an eight-team 
league. commissioner Mike Tranghese 
dipped into the South to jure Miami and Virgin- 
ia Tech. “We're going to be very aggressive,” 
he vowed. “We all believe that Big East foot- 
ball has great potential ” 

Each schoo! has made a long-term commit- 
ment to ensure continuity. The league has 
adopted a revenue-sharing plan, organized a 
formal officiating association, and set up its 
own game of the week television network. It 
also is exploring several possibilities for an 
attractive bow! tie-in. All members are to play 
a minimum of five conference games as 
quickly as possible, but no fater than 1995 A 
champion is to be determined this year, how- 
ever, even though Miami plays just two league

teams and Virginia Tech one. The title proba- 
bly will go to the highest rated team at sea- 
son's end. 

Penn State, meanwhile, is pushing prepara- 
tions for its official entry into the Big Ten in 
1993. The Nittany Lions already have 
dropped Syracuse from their schedule and 
taken steps to discontinue long-established 
rivalries with other regional opponents, includ- 
ing Pittsburgh, after 1992. Until then, though, 
Penn State likely will continue to rule the East. 
Joe Paterno, the nation’s winningest active 
coach, has ail the ingredients for another 
powerful team. The Nittany Lions won nine 
straight after two opening losses last year, 
then fought Florida State on nearly even terms 
in the Blockbuster Bow! before bowing, 24-17. 

Syracuse again shapes up as the chief 
challenger to Penn State. New head coach 
Paul Pasqualoni inherited a strong nucleus 
from Dick MacPherson, now with the New En- 
gland Patriots. The Orange capped last year's 
7-4-2 record with a 28-0 shutout of Arizona in 
the Aloha Bowl. 

West Virginia, which slipped to 4-7, hopes 
to bounce back in its 100th year of football. To 
do so, veteran coach Don Nehlen must find 
adequate replacements for a defensive line 
decimated by major injuries in the spring. 
Pittsburgh can't help but be more success- 


i 


ful in coach Paul Hackett's second season. A 
rash of injuries contributed heavily to last 
year's disappointing 3-7-1 record. All-East 
quarterback Alex Van Pelt returns along with 
44 other lettermen. Star running back Curvin 
Richards, who turned pro a year early, is the 
only starter missing on offense. 

Rutgers also should show significant im- 
provement. Coach Doug Graber has most of 
his players back from last year's 3-8 team and 
they're more familiar with the system he in- 
Stalled. The Scarlet Knights enjoyed their best 
Spring in years. 

Temple, which had the nation’s biggest 
turnaround last year, hopes to match or im- 
prove its 7-4 mark. Jerry Berndt did an amaz- 
ing job in only his second year there. Tom 
Coughlin would love to achieve similar improve- 
ment in his debut at Boston College, where 
Jack Bicknell was fired after a 4-7 season. 

Bob Sutton is sticking with the wishbone at 
Army, where he was promoted to head coach 
when Jim Young retired after a 6-6 season. 
All-America running back Mike Mayweather 
has graduated, but option quarterback Willie 
McMillan remains. Navy is expecting its first 
winning season in nearly a decade after going 
§-6 in coach George Chaump’s first year. 


STREET ANO SMITHS COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


Northeastern, 1-10 last year, hired Barry 
Gallup to lead the Huskies’ quest for |-AA re- 
spectability. He has junked the wishbone. 

Break up the Crusaders! No fewer than five 
members of the six-team Patriot League claim 
that as their motto because the Holy Cioss 
Crusaders can now be labeled a dynasty in 
the sports world. Holy Cross won its fourth 
league championship in five years, posting a 
9-1-1 record. Coach Mark Duffner’s 49-5-1 re- 
cord is the best of any NCAA coach at any 
division the past five years. The Crusaders 
have the second-best record in football dur- 
ing that span, behind only Miami (51-4). They 
are the unanimous choice by the league's 
sports information directors to win the title 
again, even though they lost 15 starters. 

Lehigh and Colgate are the main threats to 
Holy Cross. Both teams have firepower back 
from squads that finished 7-4 and were at one 
time ranked among the top 20 in Division I-AA. 
Bucknell also finished 7-4, its winningest sea- 
son in 27 years, and was at one point national- 
ly ranked. But the Bison have only seven start- 
ers back from that club. Lafayette faces the 
same problem, fielding a young, inexperi- 
enced team in 1991. Fordham has won only 
three times since it made the big step from 
Division III to I-AA in 1989 but may be ready to 
make a move. 

One thing jumps out about the Ivy League 
this season: The quarterbacks have disap- 
peared. Most every team opens the season 
with a new quarterback. With that unpredict- 
able factor as the background, the balance of 
power still might not change from last season, 
when Dartmouth and Cornell tied for the An- 
cient Eight crown and Yale finished a strong 
runner-up. Cornell has most starters back 


from an offense that set a schoo! record by 
averaging 370 yards per game—all but the 
quarterback, that is. The Big Red does have 
the best pair of tailbacks in the Ivy, John 
McNiff and Scott Oliaro, to take up the slack. 
Dartmouth has plenty returning and one of the 
few teams with an experienced quarterback, 
Sophomore of the Year Matt Brzica. Yale has a 
receiver named Shabazz who averaged 23.4 
yards a catch. Shabang! Harvard will try to 
slug its way back into the Ivy elite through an 
experienced defense. Princeton's 5-1 fresh- 
man team will help the Tigers. Penn has more 
than half of its starters back; the Quakers 
hope it is the better half. Brown will try to fend 
off Columbia again for seventh place. 


For the last few years, picking the winner in 
the Yankee Conference, where parity is the 
norm, has been dangerous business—espe- 
cially when you talk to the coaches. A year 
ago, Massachusetts coach Jim Reid figured 
his team to be in the middle of the pack and it 
ended with a 7-1 league record and the cham- 
pionship. “Everybody will tell you we were 
lucky last year," Reid maintained. “We beat 
Villanova in the mud, Rhode Island outplayed 
us, and we beat UConn without their top quar- 
terback. What we did have was strong senior 
leadership.” 

So this time around, Reid is picking New 
Hampshire. The Wildcats mauled his Minute- 
men, 36-18, after the YC beanpot already had 
been decided. “New Hampshire's defensive 
front will be as fine as there is in the league 
and their quarterback [Matt Griffin] really blos- 
somed at the end of the year,” Reid said. 

“Any one of a number of teams can win it,” 
countered New Hampshire's Bill Bowes, who 
starts his 20th year at the school. "But, hey, 
somebody's got to take it away from UMass. 
We're a year older and we expect to be a 
strong title contender.” 

The Yankee Conference will be increasing 
from nine to 12. James Madison, Northeast- 
em, and William & Mary have been accepted 
and will begin competition in 1993.

PENN STATE 
The Nittany Lions overcame an 0-2 start to win 
nine consecutive games and capture a record 
20th Lambert/Meadowlands Trophy last year. 
They should extend their Eastern supremacy 
before beginning competition in the Big Ten 
Conference in 1993. Penn State looks loaded, 
as usual, with 45 lettermen back from the 9-3 
team which dropped a 24-17 decision to Flor- 
ida State in the Blockbuster Bowl. Joe Pa- 
terno, who has won 229 games in 25 seasons 
as the Lions’ ringmaster, must reshape a bal- 
anced offense around quarterback Tony 
Sacca, fullback Sam Gash, and wide receiver 
Terry Smith. However, eight starters retum to a 
traditionally tough defense. Last year’s team 
ranked among the national leaders in rushing 
defense, total defense, scoring defense, and 
pass-efficiency defense. 

Sacca passed for 1,866 yards and 10 
touchdowns and added 137 yards rushing. 
Paterno expects him to have a big senior year, 
with Matt Nardolillo his backup. Smith, who 
averaged 18.3 yards on 29 receptions, re- 
turns at flanker. O.J. McDuffie, redshirted after 
injuring a knee in the 1980 opener, returns at 
split end along with Troy Drayton and Rich 
Rosa. Tisen Thomas is Smith's backup. Gash, 
a do-it-all bruiser, not only excelled as a 
blocker but rushed for’ 315 yards and five 
touchdowns and caught 13 passes for 153 
yards. With Leroy Thompson and Gary Brown 
gone, tailback will be shared by Gerry Collins, 
Richie Anderson, and Shelly Hammonds. 

Tight end is solid, with Rick Sayles chal- 
lenging Al Golden. Except for guard Paul 
Siever, however, new starters will form the in- 
terior offensive line. Greg Huntington has 
moved from guard to center, with John Gerak 
at the other guard, and Derek Pickett and 
Todd Rucci the tackles. Projected backups 
include tackles Todd Burger and Brian Dozier, 
guards Mac Gallagher and Mike Malinoski, 
and center E.J. Sandusky. 

All-America tackle Frank Giannetti is miss- 
ing from a defensive unit which allowed only 


i 


278.5 yards and 14.1 points per game. He has 
been replaced by soph Tyoka Jackson, who 
backed up Lou Benfatti at the other tackle. 
Mark Flythe and Perry Pritchard provide 
Gepth. Nose guard Jim Deter will be spelled 
by soph Greg Troxell. Penn State's reputation 
for great linebackers is enhanced by Mark 
O'Onofrio and Keith Goganious inside and 
Rich McKenzie and Reggie Givens outside. 
Other leading linebackers are Brett Wright 
and Andre Powell inside and soph Ryan 
Grube and Eric Ravotti outside. 

Leonard Humphries and Darren Perry are 
seasoned starters in the secondary. Derek 
Bochna, the third-leading tackler as a true 
freshman, will pair with Humphries at the cor- 
ners and Lee Rubin. also a soph. will be the 
safety. Certain to see action are soph Tony

also have added games with two other top 25 
teams: Miami and Brigham Young. They 
dropped Texas, Alabama, and Syracuse while 
retaining Notre Dame. Southern Cal, Mary- 
land, and five Eastem rivals. 


SYRACUSE 

Pau! Pasqualoni was linebacker coach the last 
four years as the Orange compiled a 36-10-3 
record, 10th-best in the nation, and made four 
successful bowl appearances. Now he’s the 
head coach following Dick MacPherson's de- 
parture to the New England Patriots. Don't ex- 
pect much of a drop-off in Syracuse's surge. 
though. Pasquaioni doesn't. 

He has the makings of another outstanding 
team with top 25 potential. Eight starters re- 
turn from a defensive unit which capped !ast 
year's 7-4-2 season by blanking Arizona, 28- 
0, in the Aloha Bowl. The Orange also shut out 
Rutgers, held Boston College to two field 
goals and Temple to three, and allowed West 
Virginia just one touchdown in impressive vic- 
tories. Offensively, star wide receiver Rob 
Carpenter has gone to the NFL a year early. 


just as Rob Moore did after 1989, and only 
one starting lineman is back. But there are 
more than enough players with experience to 
fill the voids. 

Quarterback Marvin Graves. the 1990 
ECAC Rookie of the Year, heads the five re- 
turnees on offense. He set school freshman 
records for passing yards (1.711), total of- 
fense (1,866), and touchdowns (14). Senior 
Mark McDonald. now the backup quaner- 
back, is 4-0 as a starter. Wideout Shelby Hill, 
the most prolific first-year receiver in Syra- 
cuse’s history. also is back. He caught 33 
passes for 558 yards, second only to Carpen- 
ter's 52-for-895 last year. Battling for the spot 
opposite Hill are Qadry Ismail, Antonio John- 
son, and Kerry Ferrell. Ismail. who retumed 32 
kickoffs for 699 yards. and Johnson have ex- 
ceptional speed. David Walker, last year’s top 
rusher (730 yards), remains the starting tail- 
back, with sophomore Terry Richardson an

experienced backup. Bruiser Al Wooten takes 
over for Duane Kinnon at fullback. 

Syracuse may have its best group of tight 
ends ever in Andrew Dees, Chris Gedney, Ke- 
vin Barker, and redshirt freshman Melvin Tu- 
ten. As a result, Pasqualoni may move Dees, a 
two-year starter, to tackle. That would help 
bolster the depleted interior line. Terrence 
Wisdom, switched from guard to tackle, is the 
lone returning starter there. Soph John Rea- 
gan likely will replace All-America John Flan- 
nery at center, with Matt Neenan at guard. 
Other contenders include tackles John Capa- 
chione, Kyle Adams, and Paul Borcky and 
guards John Nilsen, Chuck Bull, Eric Piekiel- 
niak, and Aaron Hunter. James Monroe is the 
backup center. 


All-America candidate George Rooks an- 
chors the veteran defensive unit as a four-year 
starting tackle. Soph Kevin Mitchell returns at 
nose guard, with Jim Wentworth at the other 
tackle. Three of the top four linebackers re- 
turn, including leading tacklers Dan Conley 
and Glen Young. Holdover Garland Hawkins 
likely will be joined by Jo Jo Wooden on the 
outside. Greg Walker, Dwayne Joseph, and 
Tim Sandquist form a solid nucleus in the sec- 
ondary. Tony Montemorra, Tony Jones, and 
Bob Grosvenor are vying for the fourth spot. 

Pat O'Neill handied kickoffs and later in 
1990 tock over as the punter. He has yet to 
supplant John Biskup for field goals and extra 
points. Ken Hawkins is trying to regain his old 
Punting job. 


WEST VIRGINIA 
Last spring, the Mountaineers unwittingly en- 
acted their own version of a MeAsS+H unit. A 
total of 32 players missed practice with inju- 
ties. The defensive line was especially hard 
hit as eight of the top nine players went down, 
two for the year. If Don Nehlen can get most of 
the walking wounded healthy, however, West 
Virginia should find much to smile about in its 
centennial year of football. Eighteen players 
with starting experience return from last year's 
4-7 team. To compensate for key losses, Neh- 
len plans same different looks on both sides of 
the ball in his 12th season at Morgantown. 
Soph Darren Studstill, who at times resem- 
bles former star Major Harris, is the quarter- 
back. He beat out senior Chris Gray and oth-

ers in the spring. James Jett, now billed as the 
fastest player in Division I-A, heads an im- 
proved receiving corps. Ray Staten, Mike 
Baker, and Ed Hill are other veteran wideouts. 
Michael Beasley, who started six games at 
tailback, and freshman quarterback Jonathan 
Allen also have worked as wide receivers. The 
tunning attack should be strong with Adrian 
Murrell, Jon Jones, and Garrett Ford joining 
Beasley at tailback. Newcomer Rodney Woo- 
dard is challenging hoidovers Carl Hayes and 
Doug Costin at fullback. . 

Alex Shook, who lettered at fullback, has 
moved to tight end. Others there include Keith 
Graley and Nate Rine. Center Mike Compton 
and tackle John Ray, the team’s biggest play- 
er (6-10, 330), return to the offensive line . 
along with guard Lorenzo Styles. Soph Rich 
Braham will start at the other tackle, with juco 
transfer Jim LeBlanc battling Joe Ayuso for 
the other guard. Depth will come from Doug 
Cooley, Joe Ruth, Dale Williams, Tom Rob- 
sock, and Dan Harless. 

Defensively, the Mountaineers will display 
different alignments to capitalize on strengths. 
Jim Gray has moved from tackle to nose 
guard, where Steve Redd and backup Todd 
Robinson were lost for the season after major 
operations. Sophomore Scott Gaskins and 
Tom Briggs join injury-prone holdover Gary 
Tillis at tackle. Rick Dolly can play both line 
positions, as can Barry Hawkins and Matt 
Schwarck. Ends Boris Graham and Tarris A!-

James Wright. Linebacking looks excellent

more and Mike Collins are stickouts in the sec- 
ondary. Cecil Doggette and Leroy Axem are 
holdover starting cornerbacks. Kwame Smith, 
Tom Orr, Tim Newsom, Dave Mayfield, and 
Travis Mathews are reserves. . 

Incoming freshman Todd Sauerbrun, who 
set a New York state prep record with a 62- 
yard field goal, is expected to do the place- 
kicking. Mike Vanderjagt is the replacement 
for record-selting punter Greg Hertzog. 


PITTSBURGH 

The Panthers had difficulty adjusting to the 
loss of star running back Curvin Richards and 
several other key players to injuries last sea- 
son. That's probably the main reason they 
wound up 3-7-1, Pittsburgh's worst record 
since 1984. 

Second-year coach Paul Hackett returns 16 
starters. An offense which averaged 372.5 
yards and 21.8 points per game returns intact 
except for Richards. He decided to turn pro 
after a junior year in which he missed several 
games because of an ankle injury. Richards’ 
career collection of 3,192 yards ranks him 
second only to 1976 Heisman Trophy winner 
Tony Dorsett on the school's all-time rushing 
list. While filling the void at tailback is the lone 
concern on offense, considerable restructur- 


110 


ing has been required on a defensive unit rid- 
dled by both injuries and graduation. Pitts- 
burgh gave up 397.6 yards and 26.6 points 
per game in 1990. 

Junior Alex Van Pelt is only the second quar- 
terback in Pittsburgh's history to pass for 
more than 2.000 yards in consecutive sea- 
sons. He completed 201 of 351 for 2,427 
yards and 14 touchdowns last year. Freshman 
Joe Walton Jr. will be Van Pelt's backup. Ron- 
aid Redmon, bothered by an Achilles’ heel 
injury most of 1990, returns at fullback along 
with Carl Hagins. Glenn Deveaux takes over 
at tailback, with Kevin Williams and Jermaine 
Williams reserves. Wideouts Olanda Truitt and 
Darnell Dickerson, who combined for 70 re- 


ceptions and 1,151 yards, missed spring 
practice to concentrate on academics. Chris 
Boyer and Junior Green are other experi- 
enced receivers. 

There's talent and depth at tight end, where 
Eric Seaman has been joined by Tony Delazio, 
Dave Moore, and juco transfer Rob Coons. 
Chris Sestili returns at center, with Mike Li- 
Vorio and Scott Miller at tackle and Jeff Christy 
and Gary Gorajewski at guard. Backups in- 
clude Jim Royal, Dan Anderson, Bill Hurst. 
and Mark Fely. 

Keith Hamilton and Sean Gilbert remain the 
Starting bookends on defense. Jeff Esters, 
who last lettered in 1989, is projected in the 
middle along with Richard Allen. All-America 


hopeful Ricardo McDonald is a stickout at out- 
side linebacker, where he'll pair with Heath 
Snell, Curtis Bray. or Nelson Walker. Michael 
Boykin has moved inside for linebacking duty 
with Mark Snemanski The secondary must be 
rebuilt around cornerback Tinker Harris. 
Leading candidates include safeties Steve !s- 
rael and Bobby Boykin and comerbacks Dave 
Norford. Dave Coleman, and Barry Threats, a 
starter in 1989. 

Hackett dipped into the juco ranks for Kevin 
Leon to replace All-America punter Brian 
Greenfield, who averaged 45.6 yards last 
year. Scott Kaplan is the place-kicker. 


RUTGERS 
The Scarlet Knights should be somewhat 
stronger in Doug Graber’s second year as 
their head coach. Eighteen staners, including 
both kickers. are back from fast season's 
team, which endured growing pains en route 
to a disappointing 3-8 record

Tom Tarver returns at quarterback with Bill 
Chesna and Derek McCord. Tarver completed 
56.9 percent of his passes for 1,348 yards and 
eight touchdowns in nine games. Chesna and 
McCord each got a stan while Tarver was out 
with a knee injury. Tekay Dorsey and Bill Bai- 
ley, who combined for 1,004 yards, lead a 
potent ground attack as holdover starters at 
fullback and tailback, respectively. Rutgers is 
deep in wide receivers, just as it is in running

backs. Jim Guarantano (26 receptions, 386 
yards) and Chris Brantiey (18-366), are back, 
along with two-year starter Gary Melton. 
Former linebacker Kevin Burns has joined 
Chris Stoll at tight end, where starter James 
Jenkins graduated. Veteran tackle Donald 
Forbes also is missing from the 1990 offensive 
line. But center Travis Broadbent, guards Tim 
Christ and Doug Kavulich, and tackle Allen 
Mitchell return. Backups include guards Mau- 
rice Owens and Scott Patkochis and tackle 
Steve Tanribilir, all of whom lettered as new- 
comers last season. Tanribilir and guard John 
Bleich were moved to center in the spring. 
Linebacking and the secondary loom as 
chief strengths on defense. Elnardo Webster, 
who had a team-high 99 tackles, and Shawn 
Williams return at outside linebacker. Jamil 
Jackson, Todd Lane, Luis Bido, and Andrew 
Beckett are inside linebackers with starting 
experience. Ron Allen, Jay Bellamy, and Malik 
Jackson are tops among eight backs who 


earned letters. Graber must rebuild the line, 
however, with Mike Spitzer and Kory Kozak 
the leading tackle candidates. Joe Ciaffoni 
has been moved to offense. 

Soph John Benestad will do the place-kick- 
ing again and David Dunne the punting. Both 
set school records for distance last year. Ben- 
estad had a 55-yard field goal against West 
Virginia and Ounne a 75-yard punt against 
Boston College. 


TEMPLE 

The Owls became the most improved team in 
Division !-A last fall under second-year head 
coach Jerry Berndt. They bounced back from 
a 1-10 record in 1989 to post a 7-4 mark for 
the biggest turnaround in Temple's 92-year 
football history. Making the resurgence even 
more remarkable was the fact only four games 
were at home. Five will be played in the friend- 
ly confines of Vaterans Stadium this season as 
Berndt builds on the firrn foundation he estab- 
lished. He has 14 returning starters. 

The key unquestionably is replacing quar- 
terback Matt Baker, the team MVP. Anthony 
Richardson, who has made five starts, is the 
heir apparent, with all-star punter Trent 
Thompson and redshirt freshman Chris Palis- 
cak in reserve. Tailbacks Scott McNair (623 
yards) and Leon Brown (573) and fullback 
Conrad Swanson (358) head a potent running 


STREET AND SMITH’S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


attack. Swanson also is a nifty receiver (25- 
192), but Temple will miss wideout Rich Dray- 
ton who caught 48 passes for 564 yards. Rob 
Graf (15-216) and Leslie Shepherd, if healthy, 
loom as the top receivers along with tight end 
George Deveney (27-402). Tackle Tre John- 
son and guards Brian Krulikowski and Brian 
Erwin return to the line. Glenn Tinner or Mike 
Brennan likely will be at the other tackle, with 
Dennis McCabe at center. 

Rebuilding the line is the foremost task on 
defense. Eric Fenwick gets the opportunity to 
pair with holdover starter Swift Burch at tackle, 
while Alphonso Taylor and junior-college 
transfer Jeroid Jeffcoat battle at nose guard. 
Linebacking should be strong, with Gregg An- 
geli and Greg Liberty returning outside and 
top tackler Santo Stephens inside. Roman 
Hale and Kevin Cary also have experience. 
The secondary is talented and deep with free 
safety Tony Schmitz, rover Mark Ellis, and cor- 
nerbacks Kyle Glasper and Ron Bruce. 

Thompson, who averaged 42.7 yards last 
fall on 42 attempts, is one of the nation's top 
punters. But record-breaking place-kicker 
Bob Wright has departed, with newcomer 
Mike Knuth his likely replacement. Wright was 
the leading scorer last year, with 85 points, 
including 19-for-25 in field goals and a perfect 
28 conversions. 

All four of Temple's losses were to bowl- 
bound teams whose combined winning per- 
centage was 71.7. The Owls’ hopes for contin- 
ued success hinge heavily on how they fare 
on a rugged three-game road trip at season's 
start: Alabama, Pittsburgh, and Clemson. 


BOSTON COLLEGE 

Can Tom Coughlin turn the Eagles’ football 
fortunes around in his first year as coach? 
That's the big question atop Chestnut Hill, 


_ where there has been just one winning season 


in the last six. Coughlin served as an assistant 
with the New York Giants for three years in the 
NFL before taking over at B.C. after the dis- 
missal of nine-year head coach Jack Bicknell. 
He'll need all the help he can muster in his bid 
to restore a once-proud program. While he 
inherits 37 lettermen from last year's 4-7 team, 
the Eagles face one of the nation’s most chal- 
lenging schedules. Big Ten power Michigan 
and national champion Georgia Tech are new 


opponents. B.C. also plays Miami and Louis- 
ville in addition to such old Eastern rivals as 
Penn State, Syracuse, Temple, West Virginia, 
Rutgers, and Army. 

Glenn Foley returns at quarterback, where 
he broke every school freshman passing rec- 
ord with 2,189 yards and 11 touchdowns. Bill 
Shaughnessy is his backup. Tight end Mark 
Chmura, a strong candidate for All-America, 
remains the top target. He has 122 recep- 
tions, including 48 last fall, and needs only 13 
more to crack the all-time school record. An- 
dre Green, Jason Swepson, and sophomores 
Keith Miller and Ivan Boyd are the leading 
wide receivers. Last year's top three rushers 
are gone. Soph Darnell Campbell, who was 
out with hamstring problems, could be the 
starting tailback if he's healthy. Freshmen Da- 
vid Green and Owight Shirley also are in the 
picture along with senior Bart Graf. Adam Wo- 
mack and Kevin Lyles likely will share time at 
fullback. The line will be constructed around 
tackles Matt Metz and Mike Jovanovich and 
center Tom Nalen. Battling for the guard spots 
are Kevin Parchinski, Kevin Davis, Matt 
Bourke, and Kevin McLaughlin. 

The defensive line remains intact with tack- 
les Mike Marinaro and John Stolberg and 
soph nose guard Ted Page. Bolstering the unit 
are Ron Stone, John Ravenna, and Andy 
Klare, who missed all of 1990 after knee sur- 
gery. Russell Durham and Kevin Donovan are 
projected as the starting outside linebackers. 
Jason Pohopek is the top returnee at inside 
linebacker along with Tom McManus and 
soph Brian Howlett. Charlie Brennan is the 


only holdover starter in the secondary. But Jay 
Clark, David Guinta, and Todd Wood logged 
considerable time. 

Soph Sean Wright will do the place-kicking 
again, with Bill Kushner handling the punting. 
Redshirt freshman Jeff Beckley is a backup. 


NAVY 

The Midshipmen posted a 5-6 record, their 
most victories since 1982, in George 
Chaump’s first year at the helm. In the pro- 
cess, they set or equaled nine school records. 
But Chaump hopes to stem the tide of Navy's 
eight straight losing seasons. His chief objec- 
tives in the spring were to settle on a new 


171 


quarterback and establish a solid. more ag- 
gressive defense. He has 13 retuming stan- 
ers. And they're now well-adjusted to the new 
system Chaump installed. 

Brian Ellis or sophomore Jason Van Matre 
will direct the multiple pro-type offense. Their 
Styles are different and neither saw action last 
season. Ellis is a strong passer who was ham- 
pered by a sore arm in 1990 whereas Van 
Matre is adept at running the option. Van 
Matre led Navy's prep school team to an un- 
beaten season two years ago. Last fall he let- 
tered as a kick-returner and reserve tailback. 
B.J. Mason and Rob Holmberg are wide re- 
ceivers capable of making big plays. Tony Gil- 
less takes over at tight end. Brad Stramanak, 
@ bruising sophomore, returns at fullback. 
Rodney Purifoy and Ivan Bullard are the lead- 
ing candidates at tailback, where the depart- 
ed Jason Pace was the top rusher last season. 
The line is bigger, stronger, and more experi- 
enced. Tackles Michael Davis and Bill Bensch 
and guards Dan Dunaway and David Lille- 
floren are returning regulars. A big boost 
could be provided by Carl Voss, a starter in 
1989 but out last year after back surgery. 
Steve Palmer and Brett Mietus have experi- 
ence at center. 

Veterans Byron Ogden and Mark Ellis are 
rugged outside linebackers. Considerable im- 
provement is expected in the defensive line, 
where tackle Bob Kuberski has been a stick- 
out. Other lettermen are tackles Chris Alexan- 
der and Dan Pidgeon and middle guard Rob- 
ert Goodson. Chris Beck, who started five 
games in 1990, and Clayton Kendrick-Holmes 
and Steve Himelspach are the leading inside 
linebackers. Holdovers Bill Yancey, Chris Cor- 
Gero, and Darrell Graham form a solid founda- 
tion for development of the secondary. 

Chaump is looking for improvement in 
Navy's kicking game. Either Tom Frosch or 
sophomore Dave Gwinn will do the place- 
kicking. Two-year letterman Jefferson Triplett 
must become more consistent as the punter. 


ARMY 

After serving as an assistant for 19 years at six 
different schools, Bob Sutton assumed com- 
mand of the Cadets when Jim Young retired 
after the 1990 season. Sutton was defensive 
coordinator under Young, who guided Army to 
a 51-39-1 record and the only three bow! ap- 
pearances in the academy's history. 

Sutton, who turned 40 in January, plans no 
changes in either the offensive or defensive 
schemes. The Cadets again will run from the 
wishbone offense, where over the past seven 
years they finished no lower than fifth national- 
ly in rushing yardage. They also will continue 
to use a basic 5-2 defensive alignment. Six 
winning seasons in seven years and those 
three postseason trips are two good reasons 
Sutton decided to stand pat. Still, he’s con- 
cerned about having to replace 15 starters 
from last year's team which capped a 6-5 sea- 
son with a 30-20 victory over Navy. 

Losses were especially heavy on defense, 
with tackle Lance Chambers and free safety 
Mike McElrath the only returnees. Five starters 
are back on offense, including star quarter- 
back Willie McMillian (900 yards rushing, 455 
passing). But among the missing is All-Ameri- 
ca running back Mike Mayweather, the No. 1 
rusher in Army's history (1,338 yards last fall. 
4,299 career). Mark Dawkins has developed 
into one of the region's best tight ends and 
Myreon Williams is an outstanding wide re- 
ceiver. Edrian Oliver and Arlen Smith are the 


Willie McMillian 
Anny 


likely replacements for Mayweather at half- 
back. Callian Thomas is expected to get more 
carries as the fullback. Aaron Scott has re- 
tumed to center from guard as the successor 
to graduated standout Bill Speier. Steve Cha- 
loult, the biggest lineman (6-5, 290), is a fix- 
ture at one guard and John Pirog will be at the 
other. Dan Mendenez, a former tight end, will 
pair with Jason Giles at tackle. 

Defensively, Chambers will team with Dan 
Davis at tackle and sophomore Gary Graves 
looms as the starting nose guard Chris Knox 
and Rick Pressel are the leading candidates 
at outside linebacker, but inside finebacking 
jacks expenence with Trey Gilmore, John 
Beatty. and Todd Soucy. McEi!rath is the top 
returning tackler. He probably will be joined in 
the secondary by Percy Coard, Duncan John- 
son, and Todd Turner 

All-star candidate Patmon Malcolm is an ex- 
cellent place-kicker. He was 36 of 36 in extra 
points and 12 of 14 in field goals to lead the 
team with 72 points last year. But Todd Haw- 
kins must improve his punting to keep that job. 


NORTHEASTERN 
They're trying to forget the past as they usher 
in a new football era at Northeastem after last 
year's disastrous 1-10 season. Gone are vet- 
eran coach Paul Pawlak and the wishbone of- 
fense. Barry Gallup, taking over the reins, 
brought in his own staff and installed a multi- 
ple type of pass-criented offense. He also 
switched to a “50° defense designed to take 
advantage of pass coverage. With 40 letter- 
men available, Gallup is highly optimistic. “We 
can win with these athletes,” he said. “What 
they need most is the confidence of winning 
games early.” That could be difficult, howev- 
er, playing the first three games on the road. 
Sophomore Garvey Mcintosh. who can 
throw the bail with zip, is the top contender at 
quarterback. Running backs include Calvin 
Johnson. Mike Green. and Tony Morgan. 
Steve Kelley and Jon Mack return at fullback. 


Junior Branden Tsetsilas may be one of the 
premier wide receivers in New England. Scott 
Adams and Scott Coughlin are the tight ends. 
The offensive line is experienced but must 
learn new blocking techniques for pass pro- 
tection. Jchn Smith is at center, with Scott Ev- 
ans and John Douzepis the guards and Glen 
Coletti and Randy Dodd the tackles. 

Gallup thinks his defensive line could be the 
team’s chief strength. Tackles Kevin “Dream” 


STREET AND SMITH S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


Weaver and Rob Kanterman return as starters 
along with nose guard Albert “Senor Sack" 
Quintero, who was hurt much of last season. 
The outside linebackers are Chad Robinson 
and Byron Turner, with Jimmy Loch and soph 
Joe Stauff on the inside, Cornerbacks Ralph 
Renzi and Derek Foster probably will team 
with safeties Mark Salisbury and Jason 
Seapker in the secondary. 

Tsetsilas is the most versatile of the Hus- 
kies. Besides pass-catching, he will return 
punts and kickoffs and also punt the ball. 
Place-kicker Dave Rusk’s range is up to 50 
yards for field goals. 


patriot league 


HOLY CROSS 
The final scholarship class at Holy Cross 
bows out this season. After 1991, Holy Cross 
will be on equal footing with the rest of the 
Patriot League, i.e., no scholarship players. 
One of those left is senior quarterback Tom 
Ciaccio, the league's preseason MVP. His 
passer rating of 144.0 in 1990 was fifth in the 
nation. He completed over 60 percent of his 
throws for 2,611 yards and 24 TDs. 


Ciaccio, though, must find new help be- 
cause only three other starters return on of- 
fense and they are in the line. That isn’t a bad 
place to start. Center Pat Gibson and tackles 
Bill Getzinger and Rick Stahi will provide the 
protection for Ciaccio. Fullback Jerome Fuller 
has gained 982 yards over the past two years 
in a reserve role. Senior co-captain Darin 
Cromwell is the most experienced receiver, 
with 27 catches last season. 

Holy Cross, No. 2 in the nation in scoring 
defense (9.6), will be hard-pressed to keep up 
the pace. Only four starters return, but one of 
them is 6-foot-5 tackle Corey Vincent, who 
had nine sacks in ‘90. Pete Dankert is the 
starting middie guard. Tackle Matt Nasser 
gives the interior line in the 5-2 some bulk. 
Marc Kosciuk missed 1890 because of back 
surgery. He was all-league two years ago at 


STREET ANO SMITH’S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


middle guard but has moved to end. Junior 
Marcus Duckworth will be one of two new 
faces at linebacker. Chris Kovath gives the 
Crusaders an ail-league cornerback. 


LEHIGH 

Lehigh could pose some problems to Holy 
Cross. The Engineers have the key players 
back from the best offense in the league. They 
include the speedy pair of receivers, Rich 
Clark and Horace Hamm, and quarterback 
Glenn Kempa. Clark and Hamm were ranked 
2-3 in the league, and sophomore Jason Cris- 
tino caught five passes for 90 yards against 
Holy Cross. Kempa passed for more than 200 
yards in every game and had the second-best 
yardage (3,000) of any Lehigh quarterback. 
Laurence Arico and Chris Menet provide ex- 
perience in the backfield, where Mark Look- 
enbill moves from wide receiver. Ken Joseph 
leads an otherwise inexperienced line. 

The defensive line is also green. End John 
Hillis returns and Brian Murphy, who missed 
much of last season with injuries, will man the 
other side. Lee Picariello is an all-league line- 
backer who led the Engineers with 148 tack- 
les. Mike Yadush and Kevin Jefferson, who 
played as a 16-year-old freshman last year, fill 
out the linebacking corps. The strongest 
group on defense is the secondary, including 
comerbacks Pete Sczerbinski and Tommy 
Clark and free safety Adam Ciperski. 


COLGATE 

Colgate hopes its inaugural season in new 
Andy Kerr Stadium is a memorable one. Un- 
like the other prime contenders for the league 
title, the Red Raiders are in search of a quar- 
terback after losing record-breaking Dave 
Goodwin, the ECAC Division I-AA Player of 
the Year. Scott Clements is the heir apparent. 
He has a terrific target in George Delaney, the 
league's top receiver last season (67 catches 
for 1,146 yards). Hans Oltinot gives Colgate 
two excellent receivers. The new quarterback 


also will get good protection from a veteran 
offensive line that includes three-year starting 
tackles Shane Bickel and Jim Buebendorf and 
guard Tim Brown. Tom Norton gained 552 
yards last season at tailback and joins Jim 
Tierney, the teague’s rookie of the year in 
1989, in the backfield. 

The Red Raiders made some big changes 
on defense, switching to a 3-4 multiple front. 
Among the linemen are ends Jim Gianako- 


poulos and Paul Schulthesis and nose tackle 
Tom Carroll. The linebackers are deep and 
talented, led by fifth-year senior Mike Jasper. 
Making the decision to move to a 3-4 an easy 
one are linebackers like Jim Kaufman, Tom 
Johnson, Jeff Frederick, and John Soi. All-Pa- 
triot strong safety Rich Burke is the only start- 
ing member of the secondary back, although 
free safety Ryan Cook has experience. 


BUCKNELL 

Bucknell will have a hard time equaling its 
best record (7-4) in 27 years. Lou Maranzana, 
the 1990 Patriot League Coach of the Year, 
must believe in the football theory that de- 
fense wins games because that is the Bison 
strength in ’91. It begins at linebacker, where 
John Spatafore returns for his fourth year as a 
starter and Kevin Kane for his third. The de- 
fensive line boasts tackle Janne Kilpelainen 
and end Roosevelt Smith. Bob Marshall is the 
only starter back in the secondary but he may 
move from cornerback to safety. Matt Walsh 
becomes a defensive back after he rushed for 
370 yards as a tailback. 

The Bison have the luxury of moving Walsh 
because senior tailback Brian Henesey has 
been their leading rusher for three seasons, 
including his 815 yards in '90. Tight end is 
also in good hands with all-Patriot League Jeff 
Pape (6-6, 235). The team is not so well off 
elsewhere on offense, where the Bison must 
replace their fullback, quarterback, and top 
receivers. The quarterback job is up for grabs. 
The most experienced receivers are Chris 
Esposito, Marc Harrison, and David “Whitey” 
Berardinelli. Tne Bison were also ravaged in 
the line where only Jeff Hart returns. 


LAFAYETTE 

Coach Bill Russo had only his second losing 
record (4-7) in his 10 years at Lafayette, and 
things aren't looking up in 1991 because of 
the team’s youth. The most promising devel- 
opment last season was the performance of 


n Henest 


Tim Kirchhoff at quarterback. He had the 
monumental task of succeeding All-America 
Frank Baur and all his did was pass for 2,248 
yards as a sophomore, including four 300- 
yard games. The most discouraging story was 
that of tailback Tommy Costello, who set the 
school's all-time rushing record but then 
struggled with shoulder injuries which could 
hamper him again this season. Art Dennis was 
the league's rookie of the year at fullback. 


113 


Soph Craig Roubinek is a topnotch tight end 
and Jamal Jordan is a speedy, experienced 
flanker. The line had problems, but Villanova 
transfer Pete Ravalico should help at tackle, 
where Chris Bellucci was the best lineman. 

Linebacker Kevin McManus led the Leop- 
ards with 119 tackles and joins Tim Moncman 
and Ed Albert to form a strong group. The 
vulnerable secondary must improve. Corner- 
back Dave DiCaprio is the veteran there. The 
line, though, is Lafayette's biggest question 
mark. Only end Obi Luckett retums. 


FORDHAM 

Fordham, 19-4 in 1987-88, knew the big leap 
to Division |-AA would not be easy. The Rams 
were 3-15 the past two years but not easily 
discouraged. “We accomplished everything 
we wanted to do,” coach Larry Glueck said of 
1980, which included one victory. “We just 
didn’t win enough football games.” 

Quarterback Gary Brennan endured by set- 
ting team records for passes completed and 
attempted (154-309). His top two receivers, 
Tom Garlick and John Potamousis, return, as 
do fullback Tony lasiello and sophomore tail- 
back Darren Wallace. The offensive line is 
small by |-AA standards. Starting tackles Tim 
Sullivan (6-3, 260) and John Reilly (6-3, 250) 
are the exceptions. 

The best player in the field for the Rams— 
and one of the best in the league—is junior 
inside linebacker Mark Blazejewski, who led 
the Patriot League by averaging over 15 tack- 
les a game two years ago. He missed last 
season with a knee injury. Outside lineback- 
ers Tom O'Neill and Joe Rowan combined for 
a whopping 20 sacks in ‘90. Tackle Curt 
Geisler is the best in an undersized line. The 
secondary has experience with safeties Craig 
Jones and Chris Tirone joining cornerback 
Brad Jordan, who had five interceptions. 


ivy league 
CORNELL ———- 
Cornell's Jim Hofher got a nice housewarming 
present when he returned to his alma mater as 
head coach last season: a share of the Ivy 
League title. Hofher, just 33, wants to avoid 
the sophamore jinx and he has the weapons 
to do it. Tailback John McNiff, runner-up for 
(vy MVP, finished two yards shy of 1,000 yards 
tushing. Scott Oliaro, the other tailback, 
rushed for 744 yards and led the Big Red in 
receiving and scoring. They are “very disturb- 
ing to the opposition,” Hofher said. Indeed. 

There isn't a quarterback in the lot with any 
experience. The wide receivers are strong 
with Mike Grant, Andy Martin, and Pete Reyn- 
olds; the offensive line is solid with all-lvy cen- 
ter Greg Finnegan leading a contingent that 
includes tackle Rob Schroeder and guard Ja- 
son Jenkins. 

The defense is not strong overall. Its 
strength is at linebacker, where Mark Broder- 
ick and Chris Mazoue call home. Cornerback 
_ Ramon Watkins is the only starter to return in 

the secondary, and end Eric Penttinen is the 
only starter back in the defensive line. Matt 
Hepfer set a school record for a kicker by 
scoring 63 points. 


DARTMOUTH 

Darimouth’s offense could be the jewel of the 
Ivy League. Matt Brzica, who likes to run and 
gained 277 yards, needs to improve his pass- 
ing to hold off the advances of rifle-armed 


114 


sophomore Jay Fiedler. Al Rosier gained 723 
yards rushing and fullback Neal Martin likes to 
punch over the goal line. Mike Bobo and Je- 
tome Gilben are the top receivers. Chris 
Mawn takes over at tight end. Among the old 
faces in the line are tackle Lance Brackee, 
guard Mike McCune, and center Greg Rush. 
Six all-lvy defenders must be replaced ona 
squad that yielded only 65 points in seven 
league games, 30 fewer than any other team. 
The most experienced players on a green unit 
are comerbacks Sal Sciretto and Rob Birge, 
outside linebacker Cliff McDonald, and inside 
linebackers Harry Wright and Tom Morrow. 
McDonald, who had seven sacks in ‘90, will 
be joined on the outside by George Neos. 
Tackle Dan Mulligan will try to bring together a 
young line. The best feet on the team belong 
to Dennis Durkin, a third-team All-America last 
season when he made 15 of 18 field goals. 


YALE 

As long as the offense doesn't get in the way. 
Yale could win it all on defense and its kicking 
game. The Elis return most of a defense that 
solidified late last season. They may have the 
best defensive line in the league with Carmine 
Perrelli, Erik Lee, and Fred Howard. The line- 
backers are Craig Vickery, Kevin Skol, and 
Milt Hubbard. Safety Scott Wagner !ed the 


Bulldogs with four interceptions. Maurice 
Saah and Eric Drury return at cornerback. 

How about this kicking game: Yale boasted 
two all-lvy performers. Ed Perks scored 57 
points and tied a Yale record with a 52-yard 
field goal. Greg Bowman averaged 38.3 yards 
per punt and dropped eight inside the 20. 

Nick Crawford might be the new quarter- 
back or he might be the tailback, where he 
rushed for 312 yards last season. Jim Gouveia 
is the other returning running back. The most 
exciting player on offense is wide receiver Ya- 
Sin Shabazz. who gained 304 yards on just 13 
catches. Adam Lenain is the other wide re- 
ceiver. Tackle Kevin Allen and guard David 
Russell are the line's nucleus. 


HARVARD 

Harvard's strength is also on defense, where 
seven Starters are back. The line helped pro- 
Guce a school-record 49 sacks last season 
and returns three starters. Right end Spencer 
Neumann had eight of those sacks—even 
though he is only 6-1, 210. Tackle Marty Popo- 


ct 


STREET AND SMiTH S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


loski and nose guard Brian Murphy join him. 
Linebacker John Lausch had six sacks in a 
blitzing 4-3 scheme. David Stires should fill a 
larger role this season. The strongest part of 
the defense, though, is the secondary, where 
all four starters are in place from 1990: corner- 
backs Greg Belsher and Robert Santos and

ground game averaged 174 yards. Matt John- 
son led the team with 535 yards and a 5.4 
average. Kendric Joyce averaged 5.8 yards a 
pop (263 yards) and Robb Hirsch tossed in 
§.7 (240). Andy Lombara is “as good as any 
tight end we've had in my years here,” said 
coach Joe Restic, who enters his 21st season 
with the Crimson. Jim Mrowka is the top re- 
turning receiver. Doug Rosenberry might 
switch from tackle to guard. 


PRINCETON 

The last time Princeton finished with a losing 
record (1986), it responded with three con- 
secutive winning seasons, capped off by a 
share of the ivy League title in 1989. After 3-7 
in 1990, Princeton could be poised for another 
new beginning. ‘ 

The Tigers welcome members of the 5-1 
freshman team and some experienced varsity 
members as well. Erick Hamilton bolted for 
699 yards and seven TDs last season and will 
be paired in the backfield with sophomore 
Keith Elias, who sizzled for 1,080 yards and 12 
TDs in just six freshman games and added 
another TD with five receptions. Senior Chad 
Roghair, an understudy for two years, may 
assume the quarterback job, but Joe! Foote 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


was impressive as a frosh. Mark Rogers and 
Michael Lerch, the top two receivers, return. 

Princeton's two lines are strong. On offense, 
tackle Chris Theiss is a bulldozer who joins 
guard Anthony Cicia and center Todd Crack- 
ett to form a solid returning group. On de- 
fense, three starters are back: Mark Johnson, 
Tom Ryan, and Leon Newsome, an imposing 
(6-5, 270) pass rusher. Captain Jim Freeman 
enters his third season as a starting outside 
linebacker. Both inside linebackers return: 
Aaron Harris and Ken Sisco. Cornerback Mar- 
vin Williams leads the secondary. 


PENN 
As with others in the Ivy this season, Penn 
should make its mark on defense. The Quak- 
ers return many from the league's second- 
tanked defense. Linebacker Joe Kopcha is 
the man in the middle, a first-team all-lvy 
choice who could become the school's all- 
time leading tackler. Outside linebacker Brian 
Griffin missed last season but was still voted 
captain for ‘91, and Jay Lee is an impact play- 
er on the other side. The line is thick with vet- 
erans, including Dan Dedic, Dave Rawicz, 
and Danny Thomas. The secondary is led by 
three-year starter Tom Oko, the free safety 
who made 105 tackles last season. Corner- 
backs Tony Kerr and Stephin Palmer moved 
in as starters late in the fall. 

The offensive backfield is another story. 
New faces are everywhere. Sundi Rush and 
Lance Rushing are the most experienced 
backs, but a sophomore to watch is Brad Wol- 
lenzier. Damon Young is the only wide receiv- 
er with much experience. Brian Hoehn is a 
solid tight end. Tackle Joe Valerio, a second- 
round NFL draft choice by Kansas

gone, but three solid players retum in the line: 
tackles Rob Ruisch and Greg Ulmer and 
guard Donald Gates. Rob Sims averaged 
40.1 yards per punt to lead the Ivies. 


BROWN 

Mickey Kwiatkowski's unique wing-T flex of- 
fense broke six Brown records in his first year 
as coach, but the Bears broke into the win 
column just twice and now they must find a 
new quarterback again. When.the winner from 
the six candidates surfaces, he can throw to 
all-ivy receiver Rodd Torbert, who set Brown 
records with 67 receptions for 908 yards. 
Sophomore receiver Tom Rosahac will join 
him. Brett Brown is the best of an inexperi- 
enced group of backs. The offensive fine is 
well-stocked with two-year starters Tom Con- 


City, is - 


don and David Cromack at tackle and senior 
Shawn Martinson at center. ; 

You won't find a much better inside pair o! 
linebackers than seniors Jason Pankau and 
Brad Sidwell; free safety Pat Allman is one of 
the better Ivy defensive backs. Nose guard 
Jeff Good was honorable mention all-lvy and 
had four sacks. Now, if the Bears can fill in 
around that quartet, they could make their 
move. They should receive a boost from se- 
nior tackles Scott Perry and Ron Dalgliesh, 
former starters who missed the 1990 seasen. 
Leo Rowland is a good kicker. 


COLUMBIA 

Columbia's annual pursuit of moving up the 
\vy ladder will get a boost this season from a 
veteran team that beat Princeton in 1990 and 
had a close call with Harvard. Fourteen start- 
ers return, but before the Lions make their 
move they must find capable replacements 
for the all-ivy connection of quarterback 
Bruce Mayhew and receiver Gary Comstock. 
The quarterback job is wide open, but Mike 
Sardo is a big-play wide receiver and tight 
end Mario Loya can catch and block with the 
best of them. Greg Abbruzzese and Bryan 


alts 


Pennartz will try to improve the running game, 
which should get a boost from a strong line 
that includes center Rich Bernard and guards 
Matt Beck and Brad Hutton. 

The Lions’ defensive strength lies in the 
secondary and at outside linebacker. Chuck 
Dimitroff may shift from rover to comerback. 
Tailback Kevin Robinson moves to. cormer- 
back. A sophomore to look for is safety Joe 
Hill. Outside linebacker features seniors Dan 
Wall and Sean Feren and sophomores James 
Korten and John Jennings. Des Werthman is a 
strong inside linebacker. The line is:small but 
will improve if senior Bob Kent recovers froma 
knee injury. Kicker Tom Boccafola made 10 of 
13 field goals last season. 


yankee conference 


NEW HAMPSHIRE 
The Wildcats finished 5-3 in the league, in a 
four-way tie for second place, and had the 
best overall record (7-3-1) in the YC after 
UMass. The Cats retum all 11 starters on of- 
fense and even Bowes admits, “We don't 
have too many gaps to fill.” 

The offense starts with tailback Barry Bour- 
assa, who led Division I-AA in all-purpose 


115 


yardage and scoring last season. Quarter- 
back Matt Griffin completed 59 percent of his 
passes and he still has wide receiver John 
Perry (51 receptions), dependable tight end 
Matt Chmura, and workhorse fullback Mike 
Gallagher. The line is solid with Matt O'Neill at 
center, Mark Schneible and Bill Moore at 
guard, and bookend 6-5, 275-pounders Mark 
Powicki and Chris Porter, two of the premier 
tackles in the league. 

Heading the defense are all-YC selections 
Owayne Sabb at end and Geoff Aleva and 
Doug Ruggles at tackle. Chris McGrath, who 
led the team in tackles with 82 a year ago, is 
the leader at linebacker. Cornerbacks Nat 
Bryan and Jim Powers, along with safety Bob 
Jordan, give experience to the secondary. 
Punter Eric Kutz retums, but the search is still 
out for a place-kicker. 

“We had a better year than we expected 
last year,” said Bowes. “We certainly expect 
to be up there." The Wildcats lost only one of 
their first seven games a year ago, then went 
into a three-game tailspin. Bowes has that 
added experience and depth to avoid those 
problems this year. 


VILLANOVA 

in Villanova’s last five games a year ago, its 
only loss was a 3-0 mudslinger at UMass; two 
of its other league setbacks (to UConn and 
Delaware) were by a total of six points. So, 
Andy Talley, who has not had a loser in his six 
years of rebuilding the football program which 
was dormant for three years, has reasons for 
optimism. “This year's team is essentially the 
same as last season and should be more ma- 
ture and harder and smarter this year in the 
close games.” 

Tom Colombo and Brad Parpan, who saw 
equal time at quarterback, return. Columbo 
started six games and passed for 1,128 
yards. Parpan had five starts and was No. 1 in 
spring practice, so there’s a healthy rivalry 
there. Pat Kennedy and Jeff Johnson return to 
the backfield. Kennedy led the Wildcats in 
rushing (791 yards). Johnson, the top runner 
two years ago as a freshman, had some prob- 
lems with knee injuries in ’90 but still was a 
producer on the ground and as a receiver. 
Scott Thompson, an injury redshirt last year, is 


116 


back to anchor the receiving corps. The other 
surehanded receivers are flanker Straughn 
Lumpkin and tight ends Scott Donald and 
Chris Nanni. Returning starters in the line are 
Randy Crane, John Marichak, Michael Pos- 
senti (6-7, 250). and Tim Tarpey. 

The defense lost four starters and the big- 
gest void is at linebacker. The line is led by 
tackles Chris Grychowski and Willie Oshodin. 


DELAWARE 
Last year was a downer for the Blue Hens, 5-3 
in the league and 6-5 overall. But Tubby Ray- 
mond’s 25-year record of 202-83-2 proves 
that the team is never down for tong. 

The Hens return 17 starters, including junior 
Bill Vergantino, who is the second-best run- 
ning quarterback in school history. Vergantino 
has rushed for 1,231 yards and passed for 
3,064 yards in two seasons. Fullback Daryl 
Brantley, the team’s second-leading rusher, 
must be replaced but Jim Lazarski and Antho- 
ny Ventresca are quality backs. Tight end 
Tom Fitzpairick returns, but there's still a lack 
of wide receivers. Dan Cooper and Keita Mal- 
loy have the most game experience. There's 
also a need for a backup quarterback. Fresh- 
man Keith Langan is a top prospect. The lead- 
ing offensive linemen are Mark Toback, Glenn 
Groninger, and Curt Chastain. 

Defensive starters returning include ends 
Mark Hrubar and Matt Morrill, tackle Scott

Griemsmann, linebackers Rob Wolford and 
Tim Irvine, and backs Tim Jacobs, Jay Mira- 
belli, Warren Mcintire. and Robin Callender. 
The speedy Callender was aill-YC and fourth 
on the team in tackles. Another top corner- 
back is Marc Sydnor. a co-captain who 
missed most of the season with a leg injury. 

A big plus is senior punter Gene Vadas, 
first-team all-East who led the league with a 
40.6-yard average. Kicker Mark Drozic is also 
a solid producer. 


MASSACHUSETTS 

Jim Reid, last year's Coach of the Year, is not 
counting his team out but he enters the new 
season with some strong uncertainties. Quar- 
terback Gary Wilkos. who was co-offensive 
Piayer of thé Year, was ruled out after suffer- 
ing a fractured vertebra in game six. And Phil 
Bledsoe, one of the best running backs in the 
league two years ago, broke his ankle in the 
‘90 opener and still wasn't well enough to go 
hard in spring practice. 

The good news is that sophomore quarter- 
back Dave McGovem, who led UM to two reg- 
ular-season victories and completed 53.3 per- 
cent of his passes, is back. Other capable 
Quarterbacks, although with limited experi- 
ence, are option man Tom Fasano and strong- 
armed Paul Tornatore. And the people who 
tan in Bledsoe’s tailback spot. sophomores 
Johnny Johnson and Eric Thimas. responded 
handsomely. Johnson led the team with 729 
tushing yards. Another bright prospect is Mar- 
vin Fitchett. a medical redshirt in ‘$0 who 
could be the quickest of the group. The full- 
back position, however, is thin, with only 
backup Duncan MacRae having game expe-

rience. Lamar Newsome returns at wide re- 
ceiver and all-YC tight end Ron Villone. Up 
front offensively, the Minutemen lost their cen- 
ter and two guards but still have aill-YC tackles 
Rich Cavanaugh and Kai Dietiker. Bill Durkin, 
who played tight end and defensive tackle 
last year, may wind up at center. 

The defense. which was the best in the 
league a year ago. returns nine starters. The 
leaders are all-YC performers Rich Kane at 
tackle and Mario Perry and Matt Tulley at line- 
backer. Other tested starters are inside back- 
er Bobby Burke, tackle John Creamer, nose 
guard Jim Mancaruso, and backs Allen Wil- 
liams, Don Caparotti and Matt Rajotte. 


CONNECTICUT 
Coach Tom Jackson has led his team to five 
straight winning seasons and a share of the 
Yankee Conference title in two of those years. 
The only thing missing has been an outright 
crown, which would be a big accomplishment 
this year with all-time leading passer Matt De- 
Gennaro no longer around. But senior Corne- 
lius Benton, who started four games when De- 
Gennaro went down with a separated shoul- 
der, proved an able replacement. Benton 
threw for 1,184 yards. His backups are red- 
shirt freshmen Tom DeSarno and Tony Valente. 

With the departure of their top two rushers, 
the Huskies lack experience at tailback. Red- 
shirt freshman Leonard Dandridge and soph- 
omore Mike Mills are battling for the starting 
job. At fullback, Craig Murray and Gerald Tol- 
lefsen return. Flanker Alex Davis, who caught 
62 passes for 814 yards and nine touch- 
downs; split end Mark Didio, who was third- 
team All-America; and tight end Brian Koz- 
lowski, who started every game last year, 
should make the passing game tough. The 
Huskies also have their entire interior offen- 
sive line back in center Pete Gale, guards 
Lyndon Johnson and David Daignault, and 
tackles Peter Gasparino and Nick Mancuso. 

There'll be new bodies on defense, where 
six starters are gone. Tackle Robert Belcuore, 
middle guard Drew Cary, inside backer Doug 
Harkins, and backs Robert Clarke and Pete 
Calin are the solid returnees. 

The Huskies are looking to get out of the 
gate a little faster. They had to recover from an 
0-3 start to salvage their 6-5 season. 


RICHMOND 
Sophomore quarterback Greg Lilly started the 
last three games a year ago, and although the 
Spiders didn't get any wins, Lilly was a 54 
percent passer. His return—along with seven 
other regulars on offense—is encouraging. 
Sterling Brown should be a top target and the 
receiving corps is loaded with experience. 
Fullback Scott Mahone returns, but third-year 
coach Jim Marshall needs a replacement for 
top rusher Eric Hopkins. Sophomore tailbacks 
Vidal Adams and Karl Johnson are the fead- 
ing candidates. There's experience in the line, 
with center Dritte Kanto, guard Curtis Moore, 
and tackles Richard Phillips and Tom White. 
Linebacker Eric Johnson, the top tackler in 
the Yankee Conference last year, and senior 
co-captains Brandon Bonser at nose guard 
and end Tracey Parker head the list of nine 
returning defenders. Tackle Mike Davis, line- 
backers Randy Kesselring and Jeff Edmiston, 
and backs Jim Balam and Rorry Altmann re- 
turn. Defensive player of the year James 
Smith will be greatly missed at free safety but 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


speedy junior Charlie Kennon looks like a ca- 
pable replacement. 

The Spiders were shut out twice and held to 
a field goal in a third game, so the accent will 
be on finding more punch as they try to climb 
out of the league basement. 


RHODE ISLAND 

Five of their six losses were by a total of 24 
points. With 18 starters returning, the pros- 
pects seem reasonably bright for the Rams. 

The offense does need repairs because 
quarterback Kevin Neville, the school’s No. 2 
all-time passer, and fullback Tony Lowe have 
departed. On the plus side is the return of 
tailback John Newson, the No. 2 runner and 
scorer in the Yankee Conference last year. 
Steve Holland started spring drills as the No. 1 
quarterback, although his game experience is 
rather limited. Sean Donovan, a three-year- 
letterman, is the top candidate at fullback. All- 
Conference wide receiver Chris Pierce, who 
topped the team in all-purpose yardage, is 
back, as are tight ends Darren Rizzi, Cory 
Cloud, and Brian Field. The other returning 
starters on offense are linemen Glenn Hod- 
gins, Rob Long, Pat Hughes, Mike Monti, and 
Dave DiGiacomo. 

Defensively, the team will be led by all-YC 
tackle John Klumbach and linebacker Pete 
Daremus. Soph linebacker Dave Slattery is 
the top returning tackler. Other starters back 
are outside backer Nate Reis, nose guard 
John Caruso, cornerback Monty Scott, and 
free safety Brian Thomas. The kicking game 
also is in good shape with Chris Cassara 
ready to do both the punting and the place- 
ments. He scored 51 points last year. 


MAINE 

After competing in the NCAA playoffs two 
years in a row, the Black Bears dropped to 3-8 
last season under first-year coach Kirk Fer- 
rentz. This is the 100th anniversary year of 
football at Orono and Ferrentz naturally is 
hoping for happier days. 

The quarterback position will be highly con- 
tested as two experienced players and a pair 
of redshirt freshmen battle for the job. Jeff Del- 
Rosso, last year's early starter, and Bob Zur- 
inskas, who finished as No. 1, both have tal- 
ent. All-league running back Carl Smith re- 
turns after rushing for 794 yards despite a 


nagging shoulder injury. Two years ago, 
Smith fed Division I-AA with 1,680 yards and 
20 touchdowns. Behind Smith is the capable 
Paul Capriotti. There are experienced full- 
backs in Ben Sirmans, Marc Curran, and Gor- . 
don Willey. Second-year players Tony Szyd- 
lowski and Kenny Squires are the leading re- 
ceivers. The Bears lost a couple of four-year 
Starters in the line, but still have tackle Dan 
Jones, guards Sean Dowd and Rich Dona- 
hue, and center Pete Saulnier. Mark Shaw, 
who split time at tight end, is back. 

Linebacker Marc Dube and tackle Kevin 
McCoy spearhead a defense which boasts 
the return of six starters. Jeff Mottola, last sea- 
son's ECAC all-star place-kicker, who led the 
team in scoring with 60 points, is back for his 
junior season. 


BOSTON UNIVERSITY 

When first-year coach Dan Allen guided the 
Terriers to a 5-6 season in ‘90, it marked the 
most victories in a season at the school since 
‘84, Because of lack of depth and experience, 
there is concern at quarterback and in the 
offensive line. Mark Haering and Greg Moore, 
who played in three games, are batiling for the 
quarterback job which was handled for two 
years by league co-offensive player of the 
year Stan Greene. The offense also is missing 
three-year receiving leader Daren Altieri. 
Scott Mallory and Brian Straughter are back. 

Running back looks solid with the return of 
Jay Hillman and transfer Zack Burwell. The 
inside receivers ara Mike Overton, who was 
moved from the secondary in the spring, and 
former quarterback Walter Norton. Two-year 
tackle Jason Goldberg and Matt Demshar, 
who moved from guard to center, are the most 
experienced offensive linemen. 

“Defense will be our strength this year,” 
said Allen. “Our secondary could be one of 
the best in the conference.” Jerome Tomlin 
and Mare Fauci are the anchors, with Phil 
Driscoll and Pablo Rodriguez the other mem- 
bers of the unit. Paul Gamber and Kevin Dowd 
are returnees at linebacker. Heading the front 
three is tackle Harold Thomas. Brian Smith, 
who was switched from the offense, and Todd 
Elliott, a fugitive from the special teams, are 
the other likely starters.

HOUSTON POST 


CHUCK PICKARD 


In a refreshing change, the Southwest 
Conference almost made more news on 
the field than it did off the field a year ago. 
Highlights included the Texas Longhorns’ sur- 
prising march to a conference championship 
and another record-setting season for the 
Houston Cougars’ space-age run-and-shoot 
offense. Even the downtrodden Rice Owls 
nearly earned their first winning season in 27 
years and—gasp! —a bowl bid. 
The SWC nevertheless found a way to link 
itself to controversy, as it frequently did during 
the 1980s with numerous teams being placed

on probation for a variety of NCAA violations 
Arkansas first made headlines when officials 
announced the university would be moving to 
the Southeastern Conference, a move which 
will become official in football after the 1991 
season. Texas and Texas A&M, realizing the 
geographic and fiscal limitations of having all 
eight remaining SWC members in Texas, 
studied the possibility of relocating to the 
SEC. Big Ten and Pac-10 before opting to put 
away their road atlas for another season 
Regardless of what ultimately transpires, 
SWC football is at a crossroads. Mediocre at- 
tendance at several universities is an ongoing 
problem, as is the distinct possibility of de- 
creasing television revenue in comparison to 
major powerhouses in other conferences. The 


SWC likely will be considerably different in a 
few years than it will be in 1991. One prospect 
being considered involved the possibility of 
adding Tulane to replace Arkansas. 

For at least one more season, however, 
SWC coaches will be more concerned with 
trying to find a way to prevent Texas. Houston. 
and Texas A&M from turning the conference 
race into a three-team scramble. Baylor, Tex- 
as Tech. and Rice—yes. Rice!—all could 
challenge for bowl berths, while Arkansas and 
Southern Methodist may consider 1991 a suc- 
cessful season if one team can hand the other 
the keys to the conference cellar. 

After frequently misplacing all their orange 
light bulbs at Texas in recent years. the Long- 
horns finally bathed themselves in a glow of 
success that resulted in a 10-2 season and a 
trip to the Cotton Bowl. A subsequent 46-3 
thrashing at the hands of Miami prompted 
some cynics to suggest the biggest differ- 
ence between the Longhorns and corn flakes 
is that com flakes belong in a bowl But the 
real joke may be on the rest of the conference 
this fall if Peter Gardere continues to excel at 
Quarterback with help from heraided sopho- 
more running back Butch Hadnet and another 
traditionally strong UT defense 


- Texas 


A loss al Texas last fail was the only obsta- 
cle between Houston, an undefeated season. 
and a possible No. 1 ranking. The schedule- 
maker decided to put the litmus test to the 
Cougars this year by arranging games at Illi- 
nois and Miami, two games in which skeptics 
should be able to decide once and for all it 
quarterback David Kling!er should be a legiti- 
mate candidate for the Heisman Trophy, or if 
he simply is a product of a prolific run-and- 
shoot offense thal once again should amass 
impressive numbers 

Texas A&M saved its best for last a year 
ago by putting together ils best game in a 
Holiday Bowl whipping of Brigham Young. A 
similar fate may be in store for several SWC 
teams this season, especially if the Aggies’

Ui 


speedy backfield also is quick to gain experi- 
ence. No SWC member has a more promising 
running back than Baylor's Robert Strait, but 
added consistency on offense and defense is 
needed if the Bears are to celebrate Grant 
Teaff's 20th year as Baylor's head coach with 
a trip to the Cotton Bowl. 

The roller-coaster ride Texas Tech has ex- 
perienced in recent years may hit another up- 
swing with the return of several talented play- 
ers al the skill positions. If incentive were the 
only criterion needed to win the SWC title, 
Rice could book a New Year's Day date in 
Dallas before the season's opening kickoff 
since the Owls barely missed a winning sea- 
son and a bowl bid a year ago. 

There is no truth to the rumor TCU fans have 
decided to hold their breath until they turn 
purple while waiting for the Horned Frogs to 
make another Cotton Bowl appearance. Scor- 
ing points shouldn't be a major problem at 
TCU, but keeping opponents out of the end 
zone might be. 

Arkansas, which must find a capable quar- 
terback in hopes of avoiding back-to-back 
losing seasons, may be in for a rude sendoff 
by conference opponents as the Razorbacks 
prepare to make their exodus after a storied 
history in the SWC. The only team facing a 
tougher bout may be SMU, which has been on 
the ropes since resuming football three years 
ago and which remains the conference's fa- 
vorile punching bag. 

Northeast Louisiana looms as the team to 
beat in what should be a very tight Southland 
Conference race this fall. Several teams, most 
notably Sam Houston State, Southwest Texas

State and McNeese, also have title aspirations 
in a topsy-turvy league which welcomes Ni- 
cholls State as its newest member. 

Jackson State and Grambling have led the 
Southwestern Athletic Conference for three 
decades, but Alabama State will create a traf- 
fic jam in this season’s championship race 
with All-America quarterback candidate Ricky 
Jones in the driver's seat. The Hornets were 
given the title nod in a preseason poll of the 
league coaches. 

Alabama State carries a seven-game win- 
ning streak into the season opener against 
defending champ Jackson State, which has 
won five titles in the past six years and eight 
dating back to 1980. Meanwhile, Grambling 
has won or shared 16 titles since 1959 while 
winning five black national championships. 

W.C. Gorden (116-43-5), the winningest 
coach in Jackson grid history, will try to im- 
prove on his numbers with an all-star cast 
headed by super soph cornerback Robert 
Turner. Gorden is hoping his offense picks up 
where it left off last season, when the Tigers 
averaged 38 points per game to lead all Divi- 
sion I-AA schools. Coach Eddie Robinson is 
counting on quarterback Shawn Burras and 


linebacker Thomas Griffin to spark Gram- 
bling's title bid. Mississippi Valley and South- 
ern should fight it out for fourth place, but MVU 
coach Larry Dorsey believes his first unit can 
hold its own against all opponents. Alcorn will 
rely on the passing of Reginald Martin, who 
has skilled receivers in Cedric Tillman and 
Torrance Small. Texas Southern has an All- 
America candidate in defensive end Michael 
Strachan. Prairie View faces a long road back 
after dropping football for one year.

TEXAS 23, ee af 
What could have been a dream national 
championship season for the Longhorns be- 
came a nightmare finish when Texas was em- 
barrassed by Miami in a 43-point blowout in 
the Cotton Bowl. The bitter memories asscci- 
ated with the defeat which dropped the Long- 
horns’ record to 10-2 under David McWilliams 
unfortunately overshadowed the impressive 
progress made by several players during 


conterence play. McWilliams was widely criti- 
cized during his first three years at Texas, but 
likely salvaged his job by guiding his team to 
victories over Oklahoma, Penn State, and 
Houston before the Miami massacre. An ear- 
ly-season loss to Colorado was the only blem- 
ish on what otherwise would have been a per- 
fect regular-season record. 

If the Longhorns successfully defend their 
SWC championship, it likely will be the result 
of another stingy defense and a highly pro- 
ductive running game. Junior end Shane 
Dronett, tackle James Patton, and safety 


Butch Hadnot A 


xa 


Lance Gunn are headliners on a defense that 
returns eight starters. Gunn will be joined in 
the secondary by comerbacks Grady Cav- 
ness and Mark Berry. Tackle Tommy Jeter and 
linebackers Boone Powell and Anthony Curt 
add quality and depth to a unit which was 
ranked 18th in the nation in total defense. 

No position in the SWC comes under great- 
er scrutiny each year than the Longhorns’ 
starting quarterback. Peter Gardere withstcod 
the pressure and, at times, even thrived on it 
during his first two years. Gardere passed for 
a university-record 2,131 yards as a sopho- 
more and may find that output difficult to

match as he throws to a group of unproven 
receivers led by Darrick Duke, Grayiin John- 
son, Cosmo Palmieri, and Justin McLemore. 

. Curtis Thrift is the only veteran returning at 
tight end. Finding capable players to carry the 
bail should be the least of the Longhorns’ con- 
cerns. Butch Hadnot emerged as the SWC’s 
Offensive Newcomer of the Year by rushing 
for eight touchdowns. Adrian Walker led the 
Longhorns in rushing two years ago and re- 
turns along with Phil Brown, Patrick Wilson, 
Rodrick Walker, and Shane Childers. Chuck 
Johnson and Jeff Boyd are the only starters 
returning in the line. 

For the first time in several years, the Long- 
homs' kicking game is somewhat suspect. 
Redshirt freshman Jason Ziegler may take 
over the place-kicking duties, while Gardere 
is the top candidate to handle the punting. 


HOUSTON 

Few offenses have caused opposing teams 
more problems than the run-and-shoot, a 
scheme the Cougars hope will produce the 
university's second Heisman Trophy-winning 
quarterback in three years. As a junior, David 
Kiingler established NCAA records with 5,140 
yards passing and 54 touchdowns. When 


frenzied statisticians finally finished checking 
the computer tape, Klinger had broken or tied 
33 NCAA single-game or season records 
while helping the Cougars to a 10-1 record. 

The record-keepers figure to be busy again 
this season as Houston returns five starters on 
offense in hopes of making its first bow! ap- 
pearance since being placed an NCAA pro- 
bation three years ago. Receivers John Brown 
Ill, Verlond Brown, Tracy Good, and Marcus 
Grant will be used to reload an offense which 
has produced the nation’s leading receiver in 
each of the past three years and which helped 
Andre Ware win the Heisman in 1989. Right 
guard Mike Gisler is the only incumbent in an 
offensive front that should be bolstered by the 
addition of sophomores Darrell Clapp. Brad 
Whigham, and Greg Whitty. The unenviable 
task of replacing superback Chuck Weather- 
spoon will fall to TiAndre Sanders. As if Hous- 
ton didn’t have enough offensive firepower in 
its regular unit, place-kicker Roman Anderson 
will try to extend his streak of 113 successful 
extra-points this fall.

Depth and experience are even more prev- 
alent on defense. The return of such quality 
Starters as Steve Matejka, James Bevil, and 
Tyler Mucho prompted coach John Jenkins to 
change to a four-man defensive front during 
spring drills. Houston’s secondary could 
prove to be its primary strength with the pres- 
ence of starters Jerry Parks, Danie! Johnson. 
John Brown, and Jamie Mouton. Linebackers 
Enc Blount and Ryan McCoy comprise the 
hear of a defense which took its lumps last 
season and benefited greatly from the ability 
of its own offense to score virtually at will. 

Newcomers to watch include Fred Gilbert, a 
transfer receiver from UCLA. and Nigel Ven- 
ess. a transfer defensive tackle from LSU. A 
September 12 game at Miami !coms as the 
litmus test for a Houston team which could 
have measured its total offense last year in 
miles (3.67) instead of yards. 


TEXAS A&M 

An extensive rebuilding proiect on offense 
was the focal point of spring drills for the Ag- 
gies, who will be trying to improve on last 
year’s 9-3-1 record under R.C Slocum. Then 
again, after a succession of superior recruit- 
ing classes, all A&M may have to do is reload

STREET AND SMITH S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


an offense which came of age in a lopsided 
Holiday Bow! victory over Heisman Trophy 
winner Ty Detmer and Brigham Young. 

Quarterback Bucky Richardson and right 
guard John Ellisor are the only veteran hold- 
overs from a unit that established an SWC 
record with 3,829 yards rushing and a univer- 
sity record with 5,653 yards total offense. Ju- 
nior fullback Robert Wilson joined the exodus 
by declaring for the NFL draft. As a result, the 
Aggies are expected to have more speed 
than brute strength in their backfield. Randy 
Simmons, Doug Carter, Keith McAfee, and 
Greg Hill should shoulder most of the burden 
left by the loss of Wilson and Darren Lewis, 
who finished his career as the fifth-most prolif- 
ic rusher in NCAA history. Richardson will 
have to introduce himself to a new group of 
receivers since Tony Harrison, Brian Mitchell, 
and Ryan Matthews were the only wideauts on 
scholarship during spring practice. In addi- 
tion to Ellisor, line help will come from Keith 
Alex, Troy Whitmore, and Greg Lakin. 

The situation isn’t much brighter in a defen- 
sive front that must hope for quick progress 
from sophomores Lance Teichelman and Eric 
England and senior end Mark Wheeler, all of 
whom were reserves last fall. Talent and expe- 
rience are assets at linebacker, as starters 
Anthony Williams, Quentin Coryatt, and Mar- 
cus Buckley return to help form the heart of 
the Aggies’ 3-4 defense. The growing popu- 
larity of pass-oriented offenses in the SWC 
has increased the importance of having a ca- 
pable secondary. Cornerbacks Kevin Smith 
and Derrick Frazier and strong safety Chris 
Crooms are expected to join UCLA transfer 
Patrick Bates in what could prove to be one of 
the top defensive backfields in the nation. 
Smith's next interception will establish an 
SWC record. 

Incoming freshmen Sean Terry and Keith 
Waguespack could contend for the Aggies’ 
punting and place-kicking duties, respective- 
ly. Terry Venetoulias kicked off for the Aggies 
last season but has yet to attempt an extra 
point or field goal during his college career. 


BAYLOR 

On the surface, it would appear the Bears 
have the foundation to contend for an SWC 
title with nine starters returning on offense. But 
Grant Teaff, who is entering his 20th year as 
Baylor's head coach, won't be satisfied his 
team can be a championship contender until 
sufficient depth is found. Emphasizing the 
need for fewer tumovers on offense and creat- 
ing more big plays on defense was the theme 
of the Bears’ spring camp. 

Offensively, Teaff would like the Bears to 
come out of hibernation. A huge line which 
averages 278 pounds from tackle to tackle 
raturns intact to create running room for her- 
alded sophomore Robert Strait and pass pro- 
tection for quarterbacks J.J. Joe and Steve 
Needham. Craig Bellamy, John Turnpaugh, 
Scott Baehren, Monte Jones, and Adam Ar- 
royo form the SWC's beefiest offensive front. 
Strait rushed for nine touchdowns a year ago, 
but bigger things are expected of a player 
regarded as Texas's top prep running back 
three years ago. Other pieces of the Bears’ 
puzzle on offense should be provided by X- 
back Melvin Bonner, tailback David Mims, 
and receivers Reggie Miller and Lee Miles. 

Baylor's defense received a big boost dur- 
ing the off season when end Santana Dotson

decided not to enter the NFL draft. Dotson, 
being touted as a candidate for the Outland 
Trophy and Lombardi Award, also will be used 
at tackle along with standout Marcus Lowe. 
Robin Jones returns at the other end, but 
depth is a concern in the line and at lineback- 
er. Lee Bruderer, Curtis Hafford and Brian 
Hand all have starting experience at lineback- 
er for the Bears, who must find quality re- 
serves if they are to match last year’s high 
level of consistency. Safeties Trooper Taylor 
and Michael McFarland will patrol a second- 
ary which lacks experience at cornerback.

kicker Jeff Ireland. 


TEXAS TECH 

A harrowing succession of injuries, an incon- 
sistent defense, and a lackluster kicking 
game combined to saddle thé Red Raiders 
with a 4-7 record last season under Spike 
Dykes. Several question marks remain on de- 
fense, but Tech should have enough firepower 
on offense to challenge for a bowl berth if 
enough key players remain heatthy. 

By switching to a 3-4 alignment on defense, 
the Red Raiders hope to increase team 
speed. Middle linebacker Matt Wingo and 
free safety Tracy Saul are the most decorated 
members of a defensive unit which yielded 40 
or more points in five games. Saul also has led 
the SWC in punt returns in each of the past 
two seasons. Mike Liscio, a junior end who 
was in on 12 tackles behind the line of scrim- 
mage and caused three fumbles a year ago, 
will anchor the line, Elsewhere, as one humor- 
ist remarked, Tech’s defense has more holes 
than an Iraqi missile installation. Saul and Bri- 


an Dubiski are the experienced members of a 
secondary that proved extremely vuinerable 
to the pass last fail. JC transfers Quincy White, 
Thomas Cale, Harry Dyas and Steve Hoffman 
will add bulk up front. 

Team mascot Raider Red shot himself in the 
feot more frequently than he fired his pistol in 
the air to celebrate Tech touchdowns last fall. 
The Red Raiders committed 38 tumovers, the 
most troublesome statistic in a disappointing 
season. The backfield combination of quarter- 
back Jamie Gill and running backs Anthony 
Lynn and Donald Marshall should keep the 
chains moving this season with help from re- 
ceivers Rodney Blackshear, Lloyd Hill, and 
Anthony Stinnett. Blackshear led all NCAA re- 
ceivers in 1990 with an average of 22.1 yards 
per reception. Hefty Jason Duvall and Charlie 
Biggurs are mainstays in an offensive line that 
will need assistance from such unproven 
players as Andy Chance, Mike Moore, and 
Brad Elam. The demise of West Texas State's 
football program could greatly benefit Tech 
with the presence of tackle Jay Clark, guard 
Stance Labay, and punter Mark Bounds. 


RICE 

Fifty-four inches. That's how close the Owls 
came last fall to achieving the university's first 
winning season in'27 years. A missed two- 
point conversion in the late moments of Rice's 
final game of the season prevented coach 
Fred Goldsmith's team from eaming a bowl 
bid. Whether this will be the season the Owls 
finally secure that elusive winning record wiil 
depend largely on how well the offense is able 
to replace the passing talents and leadership 
ability of quarterback Donald Hollas. 

Greg Willig and Randall Schultz are the 
prime candidates to replace Hollas, who was 
selected by Cincinnati in the fourth round of 
the NFL dratt. Trevor Cobb, who became the 
first 1,000-yard rusher in Rice history by rush- 
ing for 1,325 yards last fall as a sophomore, 
needs only 47 yards to establish’a university 
career rushing record. Eric Henley and Chris 
Miller headline a solid receiving corps, while 
guards Trey Teichelman and Larry Stuppy. 
tackles Mike Applebaum and Billy Baldwin, 
and tight end Kelis Crier anchor an experi- 


Outside linebacker Alonzo Williams and 
nose guard Matt Sign are the projected lead- 
ers in a defensive unit that returns seven start- 
ers from last year's 5-6 team. Inside lineback- 
er Joey Wheeler, end Shawn Alberding, tackle 
Corey Seymour, free safety David Griffin, and 
comerback Antonio Wilson are the Owis’ other 
players with starting experience. 

Darrell Richardson likely will take over the 
Owls’ place-kicking duties despite missing 
considerable time in spring drills to maintain 
his spot as a starter in Rice's pitching rotation. 
Sam Baldwin, another redshirt freshman, is on 
a long list of punting prospects. 


ARKANSAS 

Having already decided to change their con- 
ference address before the 1990 season even 
started, the Razorbacks probably wish they 
also had opted for an unlisted phone number. 
Arkansas lost its first seven Southwest Confer- 
ence games last season after university offi- 
cials announced the Razorbacks would join 
the Southeastern Conference in time for the 
1992 football season. Only a victory against 
Southern Methodist in their final game pre- 
vented the Razorbacks from the ultimate in 
SWC humiliation in Jack Crowe's first year as 
Arkansas’ head coach. 

If the Razorbacks are to rebound from a 3-8 
record which resulted in the university's first 
non-winning season in 24 years, they must 
find a quarterback to replace three-year start- 
er Quinn Grovey. Gary Adams and Jason Al- 


len were the leading contenders for the job as 
spring drills ended. but neither had estab- 
lished himself as the top candidate. The full- 
back position is another area of concer for 
Crowe, who is searching for a player with the 
combined ability to be a shon-yardage run- 
ner, a point-of-attack blocker, and a solia 
pass blocker to fill the role. E.D. Jackson and 
junior-college transfers Freddie Bradley and 
Tony Jeffery shoutd be among Arkansas’ most 
prolific ground-gainers this fall. Bradley broke 
O.J. Simpson's rushing records at Moorpark, 
CA, JC and Jeffery ted Coffeyville, KS, to a 
national junior-college championship.

cludes sophomores Chris Oliver and Ray

vital importance if the team’s offensive pro- 
duction is to improve. Isaac Davis, Stephan 
Walls, Chris Williams, and Ronnie Marlow all 
were moved from defense to the offensive 
front during spring drills. Tight end Lyndy 
Lindsey joins Henry as the only seniors in the 
Razorbacks’ projected first-team offense. Lee 
Keith, a transfer from Oklahoma State, and 
Sedric Fillmore should develop into danger- 
ous pass receivers. 

Generating a pass rush is the primary goal 


for a defensive unit that allowed opponents to 


complete 66 percent of their passes a year 
ago, a disturbing statistic that prompted Ar- 
kansas to appoint Joe Kines as its new defen- 
sive coordinator. Outside linebackers Darwin 
Ireland, Tyrone Chatman, and Ray Lee John- 
son should team with heralded inside line- 
backers Ty Mason and Mick Thomas to give 
the Razorbacks improved pressure from the 
heart of their defense. Junior-college transfer 
Darren Cooley is expected to join juniors

at TCU last fall return to add experience and 
depth to a Triple Shoot offense which may 
greatly increase its productivity if enough 
quality linemen can be found. 

Once again, lack of linemen on offense and 
defense is a primary concern for the Frogs’ 
coaching staff. Starting guard John Marsh 
missed spring drills because of injury, leaving 
center David Breedlove as the only veteran 
who went through practice. Concerns are 
minimal elsewhere on offense, where quarter- 
back Leon Clay, running back Curtis Modkins, 


tight end Kelly Biackwell, and receivers Kyle 


McPherson, Richard Woodley, and Stephen 
Shipley form an impressive lineup. Blackwell, 
Woodley, and Shipley combined for 179 re- 
ceptions during the Frogs’ 5-6 season. 
Asearch for capable talent to fill holes in the 
Frogs’ defensive front intensified during the 
spring. Other than ends Roosevelt Collins and

Tunji Bolden, TCU has no linemen with experi- 
ence. Tony Rand, Greg Evans, Anthony Hick- 
man, Edward Galaviz, Raiford Rattan, and ju- 
nior-college transfer Steve Reed are among a 
long list of candidates to eam starting jobs in 
the secondary. Inexperience also is a factor at 
linebacker, where Brad Smith is the only pro- 
jected retuming starter. Kevin Cordesman 
and Jeff Wilkinson return to handle the punt- 
ing and place-kicking, respectively. 


SOUTHERN METHODIST 

The massive rebuilding project at SMU took a 
new twist after the 1990 season when Tom 
Rossley was named head coach of a team stil! 
searching for its first SWC victory in five years. 
Although the Mustangs have ‘charted only 


’ slow progress since having their football pro- 


gram sidelined in 1987 and 1988 because of 
numerous NCAA rules violations, consider- 
able improvement on last year’s 1-10 mark 
may be in the offing. 

The retum of nine starters on offense should 
help Rossley reload a run-and-shoot attack 
which likely will hold the key to the Mustangs’ 
overall success. Junior quarterback Mike 
Romo missed spring drills with a knee injury 
but is expected to direct an aggressive unit 
which includes such marquee performers as 
S-back Kevin Love and running back Jason 
Wolf. SMU’s rushing attack amassed only 416 
yards over the season's final 10 games, un- 
derscoring the importance of such linemen as 
Kyle Carroll, Matt Hart, Matt Wisenbaker, and 
Oscar Rosales to clear larger paths for Mus- 
tang runners. Brian Berry headlines a group of 
experienced pass targets which Rossiey 
hopes will improve over last year’s 9.8-yard 
average per reception. 

Few player introductions will be needed on 
defense for the Mustangs. who return all 11 
starters from a unit which yielded an average 
of 39 points per game. Inside linebacker Bill 
Kiely, SMU's most valuable player on defense 
the past two seasons, was second among 
SWC defenders with 144 tackles last year. 
Chris Collins and Jason Bednarz added 


depth and experience at linebacker, while By- 
ron Bonds, Uzo Okeke and Kenny Rea anchor 
a line which must place added pressure on 
opposing quarterbacks. Free safety Cary 
Brabham is the most decorated player in a 
secondary which also includes Marcus Ma- 
lonson, Jonathan Dupree. and Michael Art- 
more. The Mustangs’ defense has established 
@ goal this season of scoring its first touch- 
down since the pre-probation era.

NORTHEAST LOUISIANA 
A stingy defense helped the Indians win their 
third SLC championship in nine years last sea- 
son. Whether the team can repeat will depend 
on how quickly newcomers blend with three 
returning starters on defense from last year's 
7-5 team under coach Dave Roberts. Other 
than rover Michael Young, tackle Matt Shep- 
herd, and cornerback Chad Lowe. the Indians 
have little veteran leadership on defense. 
Such players as linebackers Lonzo White and 
Mack Dellafosse, end Chris Houston, and cor- 
nerback Greg Boxley must excel quickly if 
NLU is to match a unit which ranked No. 14 in 
the nation in total defense. Added help will 
come from backs Kerry Wright. Curtis Harri- 
son, and Sean Cancelliere. 

Ches Liles is the projected starter at quar- 
terback. He should benefit from the retum of 


bruising fullback Roosevett Potts, who rushed 
for 954 yards as a sophomore last fail. The fine 
tanks among the Indians’ brightest spots with 
such retuming veterans as tackles Rob Wal- 
low and Jon Heidenreich, guard Andy Beila- 
my, center Vic Zordan, and tight end Craig 
Pederson. Experienced pass targets are in 
short supply since Kendall Farrar, who caught 
only 18 passes a year ago, is the Indians’ top 
retuming receiver. Chad McCarty is back af- 
ter averaging 41.5 yards per punt to rank fifth 
in the nation last season, while Rob Tallent will 
try to improve on his 1990 ratio of 12 field 
goals in 17 attempts.

der coach Ron Randleman. Despite their rec- 
ord, the Bearkats finished ninth among NCAA 
Division |-AA teams in total defense and set a 
school record by allowing an average of only 
17 points per game. How much more pro- 
gress is made on defense will depend on the 
play of ends Eric January and Willie Lacy and 
tackle Michael Sankston. Junior linebacker 
Darryl Harrison, who led the Bearkats with 77 
tackles, could develop into one of the confer- 
ence’s finest defenders. The secondary 
should be another strength with the return of 
cormerbacks Charles Boyce and Jarvis Mayes 


and strong safety Abby Barnett. 


SOUTHWEST TEXAS STATE 


Considerable progress was made last fall by 
the Bobcats, who put together their first win- 
ning season in six years with a 6-5 mark under 
first-year coach Dennis Franchione. Even big- 
ger things could be in store this season, as 15 
starters return to help SWT try to regain the 
glory the program experienced during their 


championship years a decade ago. 


Willie Caesar and Danny Faust are the top 
} candidates to replace All-America fullback 
Reggie Rivers, who fed the Bobcats with 
1,145 yards rushing a year ago. Quarterback 
Gilbert Price should benefit from an offensive 
line that returns center Ervin Thomas and 
guards Brad Hamilton and Derek Bailey. Wide 
receivers Robert Gasca and Kelly Dennis and 
running backs Todd Scott and Davy Smith 
must make big strides early if the Bobcats are 


to challenge for the conference title.

with the aid of such veterans as receiver 
Claude Stewart and tight end David Achilles

starter. Free safety Rod Woodard, strong safe- 
ty Mario Simmons, and cornerback Heath 
Johnson are top names in a secondary that 
also will include converted linebacker Nelson 
Robinson. Experience and depth are two as- 
sets in a tine manned by ends Mike Slater and 
Chet Hanks and guard Kevin Henry. Robbie 
Roberson returns to handle the kicking duties 
after converting on 14 of 19 field-goal at- 
tempts last season. 


McNEESE STATE 
Finding adequate help to fill several spots in 
an inexperienced secondary will be among 
the Cowboys’ most important tasks this fall. If 
the secondary makes considerable improve- 
ment, the team could match or surpass last 
year's 5-6 record under coach Bobby 
Keasler. Free safety Marc Stampley is expect- 
ed to return after missing the entire 1990 sea- 
son because of injuries. He'll team with end 
Ken Naquin and linebacker Sean Judge to 
form the nucleus of the Cowboys’ defense. 
increased optimism on offense can be 
linked to the presence of quarterback Wes 
Watts, tailback Eric Foster, tight end Bobby 
Smith, and place-kicker Eric Roberts. A sturdy 
offensive line may hold the key to the Cow- 
boys' title hopes. Junior-college transfer Marty 
Posey and Clint Miller are the likely starters at 
guard. Sam Breaux, who started at center as a 
freshman, also returns. Erwin Brown has been 
shifted to receiver, joining returning starter 
Brent Ferdinand. 


NORTH TEXAS 
Program sales should increase this fall at 
North Texas, where only 29 lettermen retumed 
for spring drills to greet new coach Dennis 
Parker. A lack of experience at quarterback 
and an unproven offensive line may be the 
biggest hurdles the Eagles must clear if they 
are to approach last year's 6-5 record. Scott 
Dukatnik is the only returning starter in the 
offensive front, meaning some of the Eagles 
may look as green as their uniforms. In fact. 
Dukatnik, running back Robert Blowers, and 
receiver Greg Matthews are the only veterans 
returning on offense this fall for North Texas 
and all three are sophomores. Matthews also 
could be moved to the secondary. Wendall 
Mosely is the projected starter at quarterback 
and will direct the Eagles’ multiple offense. 
Talented defensive backs Sean Mayes, 
Wayne Walker, and Donald Ericks and nose 
tackie DeLon Greene are expected to play big 
toles in a defensive unit anchored by line- 
backer Keith Wilkerson. Greene is the son of 
former Pittsburgh Steelers’ all-pro Joe 
Greene. Wilkerson was second among Eagle 
defenders last season with 104 tackles. 


NICHOLLS STATE 

As the newest members of the Southland 
Conference, the Colonels may have trouble 
pulling rank on many teams this fall. An exten- 
sive rebuilding project in the offensive back- 
field may prevent Nicholls State from improv- 
ing in its 5-6 record last season under coach 
Phil Greco. Running back David Craig Robin- 
son was forced into a starting role because of 
injuries and finished with a team-high 584 
yards rushing. Returning quarterback Joey 
Primus also was pressed into starting duty late 
last season because of injuries. Split end John 
Brown, who caught 41 passes, is expected to 


join Bruce McGee and Aaron Davis as pass 
targets. Mainstays in the line include seniors 
Todd Adams and Patrick Taylor and juniors 
Brian Head and Royce Nelson. 

Leon Poche and Perry Rodrigue will try to 
add consistency in the defensive line. Patch- 
work will be needed at linebacker, where 
Mark Vice and Trevors Baber are the only re- 
turning starters. The secondary should be in 
good shape with veteran comerback Taras 
Hughes and safety Malcom Curtis. Few play- 
ers are as busy as Skip Shelton, who is ex- 
pected to handle the Colonels’ punting, 
place-kicking, and kickoffs this season, 


NORTHWESTERN LOUISIANA 
Several lingering question marks must be 
transformed into exclamation points if the De- 
mons are to continue the three-game winning 
streak with which they ended last season to 
finish 5-6 under coach Sam Goodwin. Among 
the team's most pressing needs are quality 
defensive linemen and a vastly improved kick- 
ing game. The addition of incoming freshmen 
Jason Fernandez and Shane Stephens should 
help the Demons’ place-kicking and punting 
game, respectively, but last season’s recruit- 
ing haul isn't expected to provide much imme- 
diate help on the defensive line. Rodney King 
and George Salsberry figure prominently in 
the overhaul job up front, while cornerbacks 
Chad McDavid and Adrian Hardy and safety 
Rob Floyd are back to patrol! the secondary. 
Andre Carron, who has averaged 11 tackles 
per game during his heralded career, tops a 
group of talented linebackers that includes Ed 
Moses and Randy Builock. 

Brad Brown became the first quarterback 
ever to lead the Demons in rushing last year 
(843 yards) and is expected to team with re- 
ceivers John Tappin and Victor Robinson, tail- 
back Randy Wright, and fullback Guy Hedrick 
on an experienced offensive unit. Tight end 
Paul Arevalo and guards Bill Britt and Bo Mil- 
ton are holdovers on the line.

Only one year after reaching the national 
championship game under coach Lynn | 
Graves, the Lumberjacks slipped all the way 
to a 1-10 record last year in a decline that 
ranks among the most rapid in college football 
history. The main area of concem for the 
coaching staff will be to rebuild a Purple , 
Streak offense whose average production 
dropped almost 235 yards per game a year 
ago. Sophomore quarterback Mike Goddard, 
running backs Wade Booker, Kirby McNeil, 
and Reno Moore, and receivers Shawn York, 
Anthony Jones, and Tim Fields are the top 


“names on an offensive unit which must im- 


prove greatly if the Lumberjacks are to con-- 
tend for a first-division finish. The line will be 

anchored by tackle Will Sciba, guard Craig 

Bailey, and center Scott Griggs. 

Optimism is considerably higher on de- 
fense, where David Temple, Roderick Tatum, 
Michael Everhart, and Randy Slaton form a 
solid corps of linebackers that could emerge 
as the team's biggest strength. Three-year 
starter Ric Crowder returns at cornerback, 
while veterans Robert Sparks and Eric John- 
son anchor what should be an improved de- 
fensive line. Place-kicker Chuck Rawlinson 
should continue to rewrite SFA’s record book 
as a senior after converting on 48 of his first. 67 
career field-goal attempts.

ALABAMA STATE 

(8-2-1) Coming off their best season in 22 
years, the Hornets nourish championship 
hopes with 20 starters returning from a team 
that missed a perfect season by only five 
points. Included among the veteran cast are 
five all-SWAC players. Linebacker Eddie Rob- 
inson was first-team Associated Press All- 
America and the SWAC Defensive Piayer of 
the Year. Houston Markham, who posted his 
fourth straight winning season, was voted the 
league's Coach of the Year. 

Quarterback Ricky Jones, who set single- 
season school records for passing (2,196 
yards) and total offense (2.606). triggers a 
balanced offense that averaged 220.6 rush- 
ing and 220.3 passing yards. The ground at- 
tack will be spearheaded by tailback Rico 
White, who rambled for 936 yards and scored 
12 touchdowns to earn Newcomer of the Year 
honors. “Downtown” Reggie Brown carries 
impressive credentials (48 catches for 815 
yards and eight TDs). Center Patrick Johnson, 
an all-SWAC performer for three straight 
years, anchors the line. 

In addition to Robinson, end Charlies North- 
em and back Emmanuel Martin carry all- 
league credentials. Other standouts include 
tackle Joey Naylor, cornerback Thomas 
Catchings, and linebacker Jerich Green. 


JACKSON STATE 

(8-4) The Tigers, after a year's absence, re- 
turned to the SWAC throne room for the eighth 
time since 1980. And coach W.C. Gorden’s 
team is geared for another championship 
push with 14 returning starters, 

Replacing quarterback Shawn Gregory, 
who threw for 2,870 yards and a school-rec- 
ord 21 touchdowns, is the toughest job con- 
fronting Gorden. Senior Anthony Smith is the 
leading candidate. but sophs Ricky Jordan 
and Bennie Tillman also figure in the scram- 
ble. Ground punch will be provided by junior 
James Johnson, who rushed for 968 yards 
and 12 touchdowns. Flanker Jimmy Smith and 
tight end Harold Heath are topnotch receiv- 
ers. Smith hauled in a team-leading 42 passes 
for 894 yards and nine TDs, while Heath 
caught 28 passes for 574 yards. AIl-SWAC 
linemen Dietrich Lockridge and Reginald Da- 
vidson are standouts up front. 

The defensive line was hard hit by gradua- 
tion, but Anthony Palmer, Richard Baker, 
PheArthur Edwards, Keith Burke, and Patrick 
Parker will make their presence felt. The line- 
backing trio of Lloyd Straughter, Charles Ray 
Davis, and Marlo Perry ranks among the 
league's best. Robert Turner, who set an 
NCAA record by returning four interceptions 
for touchdowns while earning first-team All- 
America honors as a redshirt freshman, was 
shot and killed in May. Other returning starters 
in the secondary include Isaac Morehouse, 
Demetrius Wells, and Cari Tart. 


GRAMBLING 

(8-3) Eddie Robinson celebrated his golden 
anniversary at Grambling in typical fashion by 
recording his 43rd winning season in 48 tries. 
(Grambling did not field teams for two years 
during Worid War It.) The 72-year-old Robin- 
son has compiled a 366-128-5 record as the 


winningest coach in college football history. 
He'll build his 49th team around 12 returning 
regulars, headed by quarterback Shawn Bur- 
fas and all-league linebacker Thomas Griffin. 
Burras broke Doug Williams's school record 
for most passing yards (2,302) by a junior 
while connecting for 25 TDs. Running backs 
Dexter Butcher and Derrick Ned will fuel the 
ground game. 

Wideouts Stevie Anderson and Avery Wash- 
ington are being counted on to fill the shoas of 
Andrew Glover and Steven Grant. Nate Sin- 
gleton replaces All-America wingback Jake 
Reed. Raymond "World" Smith and Bradford

Butler have departed. teaving big gaps in the 
line, but veteran centers Craigory Sam and 
E'Vinski Davis are stable. 

Griffin is the big name on the defensive unit. 
Two other starting linebackers, Eric Cato and 
Kerry Brown, also return, while Travis Dixon, 
John Shepheard, and Ronald Perry will chal- 
tenge for starting jobs. Two-time all-SWAC 
safety Ivan Gerald will be hard to replace in 
the secondary, but a pair of returnees, 
Charles Williams and Julius Irving, will help fill 
the void. Robert Pinckney, an all-SWAC selec- 
tion two years ago, is a leader on the line. 
Thaylen Armstead, who was named Piayer of 
the Year on the ail-league special team, poses 
double trouble as a kick returner. 


MISSISSIPPI VALLEY 

(5-6) The Delta Devils earned some respect in 
Larry Dorsey's first season at the helm, and 
they are a good bet to climb over the 500 
mark with 16 regulars returning. 

A pass-oriented offense features an ail- 
SWAC tandem in wideout Jerrell Horner and 
tight end Fredrick Washington, along with a 
proven quarterback in Darryl Cox. The senior 
trio owns impressive credentials. Horner 
caught 51 passes for 878 yards and 10 touch- 
Gowns. Washington hauled in 43 passes for 
561 yards. Cox completed 95 of 193 for 1.505 
yards and 10 TDs. Junior Ronald Humphrey, 
with 763 rushing yards in eight games, solidi- 
fies the ground game. Tim Cotton and Damon 
Prince bolster the receiving corps. Anthony 
Foreman is a leader on the line. He has a 
strong supporting cast in Marvin Chapman, 
Keith Myles, Ellis Brown, Kelvin Delton, and 
Terrance Johnson. 


STREET AND SMITH'S CCLLEGE FOOTBALL. 


Joe Wilson is regarded as one of the pre- 
mier defensive linemen in the conference. 
Stacy Tillman and David "Or. Sack” Carpenter 
are other strong links. The leading linebackers 
are seniors Eric Snow and Stacy Wright, who 
combined for 105 tackles and 14 sacks. The 
secondary shapes up with Everett Nicholas, 
Ashley Ambrose, and James Williams. Nicho- 
las picked off a team-high six passes, one 
more than Williams. Ambrose also poses a 
threat on kickoffs (28.6-yard average). 


SOUTHERN 

(4-7) After posting a winning record in his 
rookie season, Gerald Kimble fell victim to the 
sophomore jinx in 1990. He will try to regroup 
with 14 returning regulars. 

Senior quarterback Nathaniel Harrison is 
coming off a sub-par season that saw him 
complete only 34 percent of his passes while 
being intercepted 15 times. Harrison bal- 
anced his ledger with six scoring and six rush- 
ing touchdowns. Sophomore fullback Alden 
Foster is the top returning rusher (254 yards). 
Sophomore Cornell Johnson is the leading re- 
ceiver (30 catches for 417 yards). He also is 
dangerous on kickoffs (24. 1-yard average, in- 
cluding a 93-yard touchdown). Mammoth 
Donald Bullock (330) and Ronald Cherry pro- 
vide a beefy look up front, while Thomas 
McLemore is a fixture at tight end. 

End Kelvin Coney and tackle Robert Harris 


ame NS 


are stalwarts on the defensive line. Coney had 
‘a team-leading 91 tackles and eight sacks 
while earning second-team all-SWAC. Shawn 
Wallace, who had a hand in 65 tackles and 
had four interceptions, is the lone returning 
regular in the secondary, but Malik Boyd is 
being counted on to shore up this area. The 
punting chores will be handled by sophomore 
Kendall Mabry, who averaged 38.1 yards. 


ALCORN STATE 

(2-7) Cardell Jones has replaced Theo Danzy 
as head coach, the Braves’ new grid chief. He 
is confident that his first ASU team will shake 
off last season's losing image and become a 
force in the championship race. 

Three All-America candidates head a list of 
15 returning regulars: split end Cedric Till- 
man, flanker Torrance Small, and quarterback 
Reginald Martin. Tillman was the Braves’ lead- 
ing receiver (36 catches for 1,503 yards), 
while Small returned from a three-game injury 
layoff to grab 10 passes that fueled a 31-26 
homecoming victory over Texas Southern. Till- 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


man and Small are both seniors. Martin threw 
for 1,503 yards as a sophomore, but his inter- 
ceptions (15) tripled his TD connections. 
Ricky Crosby is the lone experienced running 
back. Senior tackles Shaun Archer and Larry 
Walker are mainstays up front. 

End Shadrick Moore, who made 41 solo 
stops, and linebacker Allen Childress are de- 
fensive leaders. Other veterans include line- 
backer Kermit O’Ville, nose guard Orease 
May, tackles Tracy Wiggins and Derrick Ran- 
som, and safety Napolean Williams, who re- 
turned four interceptions for 110 yards. 


TEXAS SOUTHERN 

(4-7) The Tigers got out of the blocks quickly 
last season by reeling off four straight vic- 
tories to gain national ranking. But nine play- 
ers went down with injuries in the fifth game 
against Arkansas-Pine Bluff and TSU stum- 
bled across the finish line with a seven-game 
losing streak. 

Coach Walter Highsmith enters his third 
year confident that he can get the Tigers back 
on the winning track. There is a wealth of tal- 
ent on hand with an all-star cast that includes 
offensive guard Melvin Evans, wide receiver 
Will Moore, linebacker Anthony Wallace, and 
defensive end Michael Strachan. 

Ronnie Tolliver and Stacy Moore shared the 
quarterback duties last season, but 
Schmansky Peyton sparkled during spring 
drills and may challenge for a starting job. 
Highsmith labels senior Kerry Henderson as 
the team’s bread-and-butter runner. Tailback 
Dominic Jackson, who earned All-America 
honors as a junior-college player at Hutchin- 
son, KS, and fullback Rodney Holt, a transfer 
from Arkansas-Pine Bluff, also figure promi- 
nently in the running scheme. Will Moore (47 
catches for 800 yards and a league-high nine 
TOs) heads the receiving corps. 

A pair of 310-pound tackles, Raymond 
Hubbard and Eddie Smith, provide size and 
savvy in the defensive line. Strachan had sev- 
en sacks to lead the team in 1990. Donald 
Randle, Hermie Thomas, J.J. Ball, and Regi- 
nald Stublefield will get competition in the 
secondary from Willie Montgomery, Joe An- 
derson, Cedric Maxwell, and James Williams. 


PRAIRIE VIEW 
The Panthers face a stacked deck as they 
return to the SWAC wars after a year’s ab- 
sence. The school dropped football in 1990 
after suffering through two all-losing seasons 
during the 1980s. Prairie View did manage a 
5-5 record in 1988, thus reaching the .500 
mark for the first time in over two decades. 
Rookie head coach Ron Beard will hit the 
comeback trail with a squad that numbered 
83 candidates in spring drills, but there were 
only 17 varsity-tested players among them. 
Junior quarterback Kevin Phillips, who 
played on Houston Yates's state champion- 
ship team as a schoolboy gridder, could 
prove to be the Panthers’ ace in the hole. Full- 
back Jacques Denkins has logged varsity 
playing time, while walk-on receiver Bo Gillard 
impressed during spring drills. Dwane Bonner 
and Joe Carter provide leadership up front. 
Beard, who joined the coaching staff as a 
defensive coordinator in 1982, is hoping 
Thomas Houston and Freeman Fletcher will 
help stabilize the defensive line. Steve Oli- 
phant and Dominic Artis are the top hands in 
the secondary. 0

TULSA WORLD 


eo: year after Colcrado became the 
sixth Big Eight team in 20 years to win a 
national championship, the conference coes 
not appear to have a national contender or a 
dominant team within its own ranks or a clear- 
Cul favorite to go to the Orange Bowl. The 
defending champion Buffaloes and perennial 
powers Oklahoma and Nebraska have too 
many liabilities to be a traditional conference 
champion. Oxlanoma needs linemen. Ne- 
braska needs a defense. Colorado's offense 
is wall-to-wall with inexperience 

What the Big Eight does have, however, is 
the prospect of an interesting race The 
mending legs of two quanerbacks cloud the 
outlook. Darian Hagan, 20-2-1 as a two-year 
starter at Colorado. is questionable because 
of surgery on the knee he injured in the Or- 
ange Bowl victory over Notre Dame. His sta- 
tus may not be determined until September 
Mickey Joseph of Nebraska is expected to 
play after undergoing surgery to repair a se- 
verely lacerated leg, sustained against Okla- 
homa. Hagan and Joseph are option opera- 
tives with impressive passing records but who 
depend on speed and quick, cutting moves to 
make them effective. Joseph passed for 11 
touchdowns on 78 attempts last year and 
rushed for 10 TDs. Hagan set a Colorado rec- 
ord by passing for 1,538 yards last year and in 
1989 was the sixth player in NCAA history to 
pass for over 1,000 yards and also rush for 
over 1,000 yards.

is a qualitied candidate for all-conference 
honors. This is not an indication of changing 
priorities. The backs who were supposed to 
pick up the torch are there but shackled in 
misfortune. Missouri’s Tony VanZant tore up a 
knee before he ever played a down and dis- 
appeared trom the depth chart in spring prac- 
tice, then was charged with assault in a bar- 
room brawl and suspended. Mike Gaddis of 
Oklahoma evoked Heisman talk two years ago 
before being felled by a knee injury. He has not 
played since and is not in Oklahoma's pians this 
year. The same is true of Rod Fisher, rated 
higher by Oklahoma coaches than Gaddis 
when they were recruited in the same class. 
Leodis Flowers of Nebraska appeared to be on 
track to reach expectations fast year, but he lost 
his starting job, dropped to fourth team in the 
spring, and went AWOL for four days.

The experiences of these four running 
backs and the injuries to Hagan and Joseph 
diluted the Big Eight poot of offensive stars. 
Nebraska's Mitchell and center Jay Lesuwen-

ers with All-America possibilities. The most 
qualified All-America candidates are defend-

COLORADO 
(11-1-1, 7-0) The defending national champi- 
on Buffaloes will start over on offense, after 
saying farewell to seven starters, four of wnom 
were the class of the Big Eight at their posi- 
tions. But if quarterback Darian Hagan re- 
gains his mobility on an operated knee, Colo- 
rado might contend for a third straight Big 
Eight title. The Buffs have the nucleus for a 
respectable defense, led by nose guard Joel 
Steed, and any offense with a fit Hagan is 
dangerous. 

Coach Bill McCartney may have capable 
teplacements with which to rebuild. He re- 
cruited impressively the last three years. His 
1991 class is his most decorated, with 14 of 
the 20 incoming freshmen having received 
some kind of All-America recognition. 

All of this will not take the Buffs beyond third 
place, however, if Hagan is ineffective or has 
to be redshirted. He was the most prolific run/ 
pass option quarterback of his era. Many 
doubt he will be able to make the kind of tack- 
le-eluding cuts that once were his trademark. 
If not, the Buffs will be in trouble. Charles 
Johnson, who replaced Hagan in the Orange 


Bowl and directed the winning touchdown 
against Notre Dame, chose to bypass his final 
year of eligibility to enter graduate school. 
Rookie Vance Joseph is next in !:ine. He is 
promising, but the remainder of the offense 
screams for an experienced quarterback. 
Tailback Kent Kahl, a redshirt fresnman, is 
the leading candidate to repiace Enc Bien- 
iemy. the Big Eight Player of the Year. Flanker 
Rico Smith moves into the hole vacated by 
Mike Pritchard, voted MVP by his teammates. 
Fullback James Hill and split end Mark Henry 
complete an all-new cast at the skill positions.

fee) huskers are taking the attitude that a rebuilt 
defense can’t be worse than a year ago. 
Ro) Whatever, coach Tom Osborne will depend 
re] foremost on his offense. If quarterback Mickey 
Joseph regains the speed and elusiveness he 
Gisplayed prior to suffering a severely lacerat- 
ed leg against Oklahoma, the Cornhuskers 
should have the Big Eight’s best offense. Jo- 
seph, who was sufficiently ahead of his recov- 
ery schedule to participate in spring practice, 
will pass and hand off to the best group of 
skill-position athletes in the conference. 
Tailback Derek Brown, who wrested the 
starting job last season from rushing leader 
Leodis Flowers, is a potential star. Flowers 
went AWOL for four days in spring practice 
after falling to the fourth team. Omar Soto re- 
tums at fullback but Scott Baldwin, moved 
from tailback, will enhance the position, even 
if he is a backup. Split end John Bostick and 
wingback Nate Turner are among the best re- 
ceivers in the conference, but the dynamite 
playmaker is tight end Johnny Mitchell, who 
made all-Big Eight last year as a freshman, 
when he did not start but specialized in home- 


run receptions. If Joseph does not play, Os- 
borne plans to capitalize on this receiver 
corps by turning to Tom Hasse, who passed 
impressively in the Citrus Bowl. 

The offensive line, once a strength with big 
fifth-year seniors, has eroded in recent years 
by scholarship limits that restricted redshirt- 
ing. Last year the line was a liability and small 
by Nebraska standards. The 1991 model will 
be large. But will it be better? Guard Will 
Shields and tackle Brian Boerboom are re- 
turning starters. Tackle Erik Wiegert, center 
Bill Ziegelbein, and guard Dave Jensen are 
bigger than their predecessors. 

Only four starters return on defense: line- 
backer Mike Petko, nose guard Pat Engelbert. 
end Travis Hill, and safety Tyrone Byrd. Of the 
other probable starters, end David White is 
the most promising. Tackles John Parrella and 
Brian Brown and linebacker Mike Anderson 
are unproven. The biggest concern is the sec- 
ondary, where strong safety Steve Carmer 
and cornerbacks Sedric Collins and Curtis 
Cotton came out of spring as starters. 

Punter Mike Stigge (41.4) returns but Byron 
Bennett represents a place-kicking drop-off.

COLORADO 
(11-1-1, 7-0) The defending national champi- 
on Buffaloes will start over on offense, after 
saying farewell to seven starters, four of whom 
were the class of the Big Eight at their posi- 
tions. But if quarterback Darian Hagan re- 
gains his mobility on an operated knee, Colo- 
rado might contend for a third straight Big 
Eight title. The Buffs have the nucleus for a 
respectable defense, led by nose guard Joel 
Steed, and any offense with a fit Hagan is 
dangerous. 

Coach Bill McCartney may have capable 
replacements with which to rebuild. He re- 
Cruited impressively the last three years. His 
1991 class is his most decorated. with 14 of 
the 20 incoming freshmen having received 
some kind of All-America recognition. 

Ail of this will not take the Buffs beyond third 
place, however, if Hagan is ineffective or has 
to be redshirted. He was the most prolific run/ 
Pass option quarterback of his era. Many 
doubt he will be able to make the kind of tack- 
le-eluding cuts that once were his trademark. 
If not, the Buffs will be in trouble. Charles 
Johnson, who replaced Hagan in the Orange 


Bow! and directed the winning touchdown 
against Notre Dame. chose to bypass his final 
year of eligibility to enter graduate school. 
Rookie Vance Joseph is next in line. He is 
promising, but the remainder of the offense 
screams for an experienced quarterback. 
Taitback Kent Kahl, a redshin freshman, is 
the leading candidate to replace Eric Bien- 
iemy, the Big Eight Player of the Year. Flanker 
Rico Smith moves into the hole vacated by 
Mike Pritchard, voted MVP by his teammates. 
Fullback James Hill and split end Mark Henry 
complete an all-new cast at the skill positions.

(3-7-1, 2-4-1) After being overwhelmed by its 
nonconference schedule (Miami, Virginia,

19 returning starters and the conference's 
best all-purpose kicker, plus the first sem- 
blance of depth since he arrived. 

But Kansas was only seven points from be- 
ing 0-7 in the conference and, Mason 
stressed, “We must make strides on offense 
and defense to continue the progress and 
teach our objective." The objective on offense 


- is to generate more points and waste fewer 


opportunities. Kansas ranked fourth in pass- 
ing and fifth in rushing but last in scoring. 

Chip Hilleary, the Big Eight leader among 
starting quarterbacks in completion percent- 
age, and tailback Tony Sands, sixth in rushing 
(757 yards), lead a returning cast of starters 
that includes receivers Rob Licursi, Kenny 
Drayton, and Rodney Harris; fullback Roger 
Robben, tight end Chad Fette, tackles Chris- 
topher Perez and Keith Loneker, and guards 
Scott Imwalle and Dan Schmidt. Scott 
McCabe replaces center Chip Budde.

returns comerbacks Hassan Bailey and Tim 
Hill, linemen Lance Flachsbarth, Dana Stubb- 
lefield, and Gilbert Brown, and ends Pat Ro- 
gan and Guy Howard. Others who could start 
are lineman Brian Christian, end Robert Mitch- 
ell, and safety Doug Terry. 

Dan Eichioff had the best average among 
Big Eight punters (42.3 yards) last year and 
was successful on 15 of 21 field goals, includ- 
ing a school-record 58-yarder.

IOWA STATE 

(4-6-1, 2-4-1) The Cyclones scored the Big 
Eight’s most stunning upset in recent years by 
defeating Oklahoma, 33-31, at Norman. The 
midseason shocker enhanced coach Jim 
Walden's reputation for toppling heavy- 
weights. But lowa State spent the remainder 
of the season getting upset. Injuries were a 
factor in a sour finish. 

In their quest for consistency, the Cyclones 
have one of the Big Ejight’s better quarter- 
backs in Chris Pedersen, the conference 
leader in total offense, the conference's big- 
gest offensive line, and nine returning starters 
on defense. Pedersen, who unraveled Okla- 
homa by running draw plays for 148 yards 
and passing for 102 yards, is expected to be a 
more prolific passer if wide receiver Steve 


Lester becomes eligible. Lester missed last 
season. He caught 13 passes for 123 yards 
when lowa State set a record against Oklaho- 
ma by gaining 609 yasds in a 43-40 Ioss in 
1989. Tailback Sherman Williams, receivers 
Chris Spencer and James Brooks, fullback 
Sundiata Patterson, and tight end Paul 
Schulte assure Pedersen of experience at the 
skill positions. But Pedersen’s greatest com- 
plement might be in the line, where three 300- 
pounders—tackles Doug Skartvedt, Todd 
McClish, and Lance Keller—and center Scott 
Armbrust, a starting guard last year, and 
guard Lance Henkel provide protection. 

A defense that ranked fifth in the confer- 
ence is led by outside linebackers Larry Rati- 
gan and Dan Watkins and free safety Mark 
DouBrava. Other returning starters are ends 
Mark Dunn and Matt Rehberg, middle line- 
backer Dan Milner, tackles Matt Grubb and 
Travis Block, and strong safety Kevin Lazard. 

Punter Jon Schnoor retums and highly re- 
garded Ty Stewart will be the place-kicker. 


KANSAS STATE 

(5-6, 2-5) If quarterback Paul Watson avoids 
the kind of injuries that plagued him as a spot 
starter and backup for two years, the Wildcats 
might sustain the pace they set last year. Oth- 
er than quarterback Cart Straw, whose pass- 
ing was the primary reason the Wildcats won 
more games than they did in the previous five 
seasons combined, almost everyone returns. 

Watson has a strong arm and the Big 
Eight's best pair of wide receivers in Michael 
Smith and Frank Hemandez. Smith was sec- 
ond in conference receptions (46) and Her- 
nandez was fourth (41). Russ Campbell led 
Big Eight tight ends with 27 receptions. While 
closing the gap on their second-division ri- 
vals, the Wildcats were outscored, 143-18 by 
the big three of Colorado, Nebraska, and 
Oklahoma, which exposed their porous de- 
fense and running game. 

Coach Bill Snyder hopes Eric Gallon, 
moved from flanker to tailback, will improve a 
running game that averaged a conference low 
of 3.0 yards per play. Rod Schiller is back at 
fullback. Center Quentin Neujahr is the best of 
an offensive line that returns intact. Tackles 
David Gleue and Mike Orr and guards Doug 
Warren and Doug Grush retum, along with 
their backups.

Linebacker Brooks Barta and cornerback

Simpson, linebacker Chris Patterson, and 
secondary veterans Rogerick Green, William

Place-kicker Tate Wright, a pleasant sur- 
prise as a walk-on, returns; Sean Snyder, son 
of the coach, is the probable punter. 


OKLAHOMA STATE 
(4-7, 2-5) Tailback U. may have run out of 
tailbacks. Gerald Hudson, who became the 


third OSU tailback in a decade to lead the 
nation in rushing, completed his eligibility. 
Hudson's strong finish took the Cowboys with- 
in a game-ending field goal against Kansas of 
finishing fourth. Coach Pat Jones, who has 
lived on the abilities of skill-position opera- 
tives, has seen his speed depleted by the tolls 
of an NCAA probation. He will count on an 
incoming freshman tailback and juco receiv- 
ers to prevent a further slide. 

The rookies on whom Jones is counting 
have impressive credentials. Tailback Rafael 
Denson was a decorated schoolboy and wide 
receivers Bert Milliner and Duncan Boyd were 
speedy, big-play specialists in junior college.

The remainder of the offense is experienced 
but limited in ability. Quarterbacks Kenny 
Ford and Earl Wheeler, who shared time last 
year, may be pressed by redshin freshman 
Brent Scott. Tailback Kelly Yancy, a juco 
transfer, lacks speed. Other retuming starters 
are tight end Scott Copeland and linemen 
Joseh Arrot. Brian Bobo. Pete Surrette. and 
Matt Jose. 

The defense has one of the Big Eight's bet- 
ter linemen in tackle Stacey Satterwhite and 
an athletic end in Jason Gildon. End George 
Bright, linebackers Mike Woolridge, Richie 
Ansley, and Clarence Nobles, safeties Scott 
Harmon and Jay Fleischman, and cornerback 
Mike Clark are returning starters. 

The punting and place-kicking will be han- 
died by the inexperienced Rick Myers or by 
incaming freshmen. 


MISSOURI 

(4-7, 2-5) The Tigers. who have nat had a win- 
ning record since 1983, start their third sea- 
son under Bob Stul! as they did the last two: 
trying to become respectable with their rush- 
ing offense and rushing defense. Running 
and stopping the run were once trademarks of 
Missouri's success Lately, the Tigers have 
not done either That guarantees failure in a 
conference where the best teams run. 

Stull expects to have ancther solid passing 
attack. Quarterback Phil Johnson, who as a 
reserve completed 65 percent of his passes 
for 954 yards, becomes the starter. He has 
promising targets in wideouts Skip Leach, 
Victor Bailey. Kenny Holly, and Kenneth Dunn. 
But tight end is a concem. Center Brad Funk 
and tackle Russ McCullough are the leaders 
of a line that returns starting guards Mike Be- 
dosky and Don Wright. A new hope for the 
running game ts tailback Ronnell Kayhill. 

End Rick Lyle is the defense’s only player 
with all-star potential. But Stull was encour- 
aged by the spring play of tackles George 
Hunt and Mario Johnson, middle linebacker 
Tom Reiner, outside linebacker Mike Ring- 
genberg, and cornerback Maurice Benson,

TULSA a a 
(4-7) The Hurricane’s 1990 season was stag- 
gered before it began by the loss of outstand- 
ing receiver Dan Bitson, who suffered serious 
injuries in an automobile accident. The sea- 
son was lost when quarterback T.J. Rubley 
suffered a disabling knee injury in the third 
game. Rubley, who passed for 22 touch- 
Gowns and had only six interceptions in 1989, 
will return this year. Bitson, who had 73 recep- 
tions and 16 touchdowns in ‘89, will try to re- 
turn but is not given any chance of regaining 
his all-star form. Wide receiver Marlow Fair, 
tailback Ron Jackson and a big. experienced 
line make coach Dave Rader believe the of- 
fense will be improved. 

Six starters return on defense: linebackers 
Mike White and Tracy Scroggins. nose guard 
Phil Holmes, tackle Aaron Tallman. and safe- 
ties Herbert Harvey and James Blake. 

Tulsa's most attractive home schedule in 
history (Miami, Texas A&M, and Oklahoma 
State) could enrich the Hurricanes at the bank 
but bankrupt them on the scoreboard.

Place-kicker Brian Mitchell earned All-

SOUTHWEST MISSOURI STATE 

For the first time in conference history, the 

Bears repeated as champs, sharing the top 

spot with Northern lowa. Can two-time Gate- 

way Coach of the Year Jesse Branch stage a 
threepeat? The numbers are against it, for 

only four starters return on offense (and eight 

on defense). Branch's No. 1 task will be to . 
retool an offense that led the league in rushing 

and scoring. 

Replacements must be found for quarter- 
back DeAndre Smith, who passed for 1,970 
yards and nine touchdowns and ran for 824 
yards and 18 TDs, and for fullback Eric Jen- 
kins, who rushed for 1,055 yards and nine 
scores. Halfbacks Shawn Cooper and Antho- 
ny Pegues and wideout Travis Ezard were 
productive receivers. Cooper was the primary 
target (39 catches for 437 yards), Pegues was 
second (27 for 430), and Ezard chipped in (12 
for 266). Cleveland Antoine is the leading 
quarterback candidate, but he has seen little 
action, Fullbacks Jonah White and Damon 
Frost have experience. The line will have to be 
rebuilt since only center Tim McDuffey and 
guard Matt Irvin return. 

The defense needs to plug a few holes, but 
it should be solid. Leading tackler Robert Har- 
bolt has graduated but tackle Bill Walter re- 
turns. Outside linebacker Mark Walker and 
end Andy Murray had three fumble recoveries

Coach Bob Spoo feels the Panthers are 
poised to make a run for a I-AA playoff spat. 
But first EIU must win the league title, and in 
order to accomplish that it must defeat North- 
ern fowa and Southwest Missouri State, last 
year's co-champs. 

The offense will again center around tail- 
back Jamie Jones. He rushed for a league- 
leading 1,055 yards and was No. 5 nationally 
with 146.3 all-purpose yards per game. Soph 
quarterback Jeff Thorne, who was averaging 
185 passing yards per game before sitting out 
the last five games with an ankle injury, re- 
turns. His targets will be wideouts Jason Cook 
(51 receptions) and Mike Rummeil (50) and 
the tight-end trio of Tim Moore, Mark Grady, 
and Mike Sahm, who combined for 36 
catches for 471 yards. Brad Fichtel anchors 
the line that also returns Dan Purcell, Brian 
Callahan, and Tim Gleason. 

Kent Mcintyre is the star of the defense that 
retains six regulars. He recorded 85 tackles, 
three sacks, and retumed a blocked punt fora 
touchdown to eam all-conference acclaim. 
Tackles Dan Dee and Joe Remke have expe- 
fience and leading tackler Mike Settles is 
joined at linebacker by Cam Brousseau and 
Dan Wegrzyn. The secondary features Tony 
Farrell and Jeff Miles. Punter Brian Pindar 
ranked No. 12 in the nation (40.5) and has not 
had a kick blocked in 202 attempts. 


ILLINOIS STATE 

The Redbirds have steadily improved in each 
of the four years under coach Jim Heacock. 
Like Easter Illincis, with whom they shared 
second place in the league, they feel they are 
ready to challenge for the top spot, with 16 
retuming starters. 

A solid and experienced defense features 
five seniors: tackle Tony Jones, linebackers 
Wilbert Brown and Tom Newberry, safety An- 
thony Burton, and comerback Antoine Warth- 


136 


man. The unit led the conference in pass de- 
fense (130.9 yards per game) and was sec- 
ond in scoring defense (17.2 ppg). Jones was 
first-team all-GC, notching 100 tackles, in- 
cluding a team-leading 15 for loss, and 11 
sacks. Burton led with three interceptions and 
Worthman had two. Nose guard Vander Har- 
ris, end Scott Love, and strong safety Joe 
Woods have experience. 

The only question mark on offense appears 
to be at quarterback, where Adrian Wilson 
and George Brown are competing to replace 
Brian Chaney, who was third in the league in 
passing and sixth in total offense. Toby Davis 
led the Redbirds with 559 yards rushing but 
will move over to fullback to make room for 
tailback Ritchie Thompson. Wideout Clarence 
Miller had 19 catches and tight end Brian 
Brown (6-5, 235) had 25. Guards Fernando 
Peters and Mark Lee will be joined by tackle 
Brent Haar and center Marty Roberts. Punter 
Doug Breger also retums. 


INDIANA STATE 

The Sycamores will try to shake off their sec- 
ond consecutive 4-7 finish, and a winning re- 
cord is a realistic goal for coach Dennis Raetz 
this fall. Among 17 retuming starters are All- 
America running back Derrick Franklin and 
wideout Charles Swann and all-league fine- 
backer Eric Christensen. 

The main candidate to replace quarterback 
John Stites is Eastem Illinois transfer Kip Hen- 
nelly. He'll be pushed by senior Ray Allen and 
redshirt freshman Jack Hendershot. The 
backfield returns the nation’s second-leading 
rusher, Franklin (1,301 yards). The Sycamores 
have quality receivers in Swann (39 catches 
for 486 yards), Tony Brewer (21 for 402), and 
Demetrius Dowler (20 for 269). Kirk Christen- 
sen and James Juillerat return at tight end. 
The line retains regulars George FitzSimmons, 
David Sharbaugh, and Robert Egidi. 

The defense is led by Christensen, the lead- 
ing tackler for the second year in a row. He 
was the Gateway Player of the Week after he 
blocked a punt and had an interception to 
seal the Sycamores’ 33-23 upset of Northern 
towa last October. Doug Dutton, Dyrrah Chris- 
ton, and Robert Patton are back in the line. 
Linebacker Clint Davis was No. 2 in tackles, 
but he is recovering from an ankle injury and 
May not be ready for the opener. Van 
Ganaway moves from comer to safety. Brian 
Bridgewater is the strong safety and Donald 
Cox and Sclomon Emerson the comers. 


WESTERN ILLINOIS 

The 1980 season was a rude awakening for 
first-year coach Randy Bail. But despite a 3-8 
record, the Leathernecks managed to sal- 
vage a hint of self-esteem by winning two of 
their final three games to secure a three-way 
tie for second place in the Gateway. Then they 
dropped their last game, 50-16, to Nevada. "I 
should think we have lots of incentive to im- 
prove ourselves,” said Ball. “We'll have to so- 
lidify our offensive line, acquire some speedy 
receivers, and find another linebacker.” 

Eight players earned all-conference hon- 
ors, including guard John Binkowski and de- 
fensive back Bryan Cox. Second-team all-GC 
running back Mike Cox averaged 4.7 yards 
per carry en route to 646 yards. Soph Willie 
Davis completed 104 of 214 passes for 1,179 
yards and six touchdowns. Center Brad Wag- 
ner (6-5, 280) was second-team all-GC and 
tackle Paul Weltha was honorable mention. 
Brad Velde caught 36 passes for 592 yards

lenge for the conference crown yet.” coach 
Bob Smith admitted, “but we're much closer

GREENSBORO NEWS & RECORD 


No longer does football play second fid- 
die to basketball along Tobacco Road. 
That changed emphatically during the past 12 
months. Although Duke brought the treasured 
NCAA basketball title to the Atlantic Coast 
Conference, the league's football programs 
muscled their way into the spotlight. Consider: 
@ Georgia Tech won a share of the mythical 
national football championship, earning the 
No. 1 spot in balloting by coaches for United 
Press International. 

@ Five ACC teams played in bowls. 

@ The ACC's 3-1-1 postseason record was the 
best among conferences with more than one 
bowl team. 

@ ACC teams went 28-8-1 against nonconfer- 
ence opposition, a percentage of .770 that far 
outdistanced the Southeastern Conference's 
27-16-2, .622 

“| think maybe our conference got its re- 
spect on New Year's Day,” said Georgia Tech 
coach Bobby Ross, whose team celebrated 
the advent of 1991 by routing Nebraska, 45—- 
21, in the Florida Citrus Bowl at Orlando. At 
the same time, a few miles down the Interstate 
in the Hall of Fame Bowl at Tampa, Clemson 
played a 30-0 tune on Illinois. That night, Ten- 
nessee needed a last-gasp touchdown to 
edge Virginia, 23-22, in the Sugar Bowl. In 
addition, Maryland played Louisiana Tech to a 
34-34 deadlock in the Independence Bowl 
and North Carolina State stopped Southern 
Mississippi, 31-27, in the All-American Bowl. 

“| think our league is very credible; I've al- 
ways felt that way,” Ross said. "A few more 
people may pay attention because of New 
Year's Day.” 

“What everybody locks at is the back- 
ground of the league and not today,” North 
Carolina coach Mack Brown said. "It’s obvi- 
ous our league can compete with any league.” 

Be assured the ACC's football excellence 
did not end on New Year's Day. Georgia Tech 
and Clemson will be loaded again, and their 
showdown September 28 at Clemson should 
be one to remember. (Keep in mind that Flori- 
da State joins the ACC next season.) 

That will make the football even more po- 
tent. Players like Tech quarterback Shawn 
Jones and safety Ken Swilling and Clemson 
linebacker Levon Kirkland will rank with the 
best in the nation. 

Among independents, South Carolina and 
Virginia Tech should lead the way. The Game- 
cocks, in their final season before entering the 
Southeastern Conference, hope a revamped 
defense opens the way for a big season. Vir- 
ginia Tech is loaded, especially on offense, 
but a wicked five-game stretch of road games 
could spoil the record. 

In the Southern Conference, Furman retums 
a@ veteran offensive line and one of the area's 
top running backs, and should rank among 
the nation’s premier I-AA teams. Quarterback

Michael Payton and a rugged defense will 
keep Marshall in the race, and The Citadel, 
with more balance to its offense, will chal- 
lenge, too. 

Last year in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Con- 
ference, the season played out exactly as pre- 
dicted. Well, almost exactly. Florida A&M, Del- 
aware State, and Howard were expected to 
be among the league’s front-runners for the 
title. But to the surprise of many, North Caroli- 
na A&T joined the race and established itself 
as a fourth contender for the championship. 
As it turned out, Florida A&M's 17-15 victory 
over the Aggies in October won the Rattlers 
the league title. FAMU finished unbeaten in 
MEAC play, one game better than A&T and 
two better than Delaware State. 

This season, it looks as though A&T will be 
the team to beat. The Aggies have the bulk of 
their squad back from last year, including 
quarterback Connell Maynor, the league's of- 
fensive player of the year. A&M also returns a 
quality quarterback in Tony Ezell, but it lost 
1,000-yard rusher Amir Rasu!. Delaware State

Carolina State will again field one of the

continue to try to gain on the rest of the league.

pected jolt, but the tailback corps is deep, 
and the receiver positions are well-stocked 
with Bobby Rodriguez and Emmett Merchant 
heading the cast. 

They operate behind a line led by tackle 
Mike Mooney (6-7, 315). But Tech must re- 
place three interior linemen. “Not only did we 
lose quality football players, we also lost a 
wealth of experience,” Ross said. “We're go- 
ing to have an inexperienced line; that's my 
biggest concern.” 

Swilling and outside linebacker Marco 
Coleman earned All-America honors and lead 
a defense that should be improved. Coleman 
tanks among the foremost pass rushers; he 
had 13 sacks in 1980. Swilling moves from 
free to strong safety and his 71 tackles should 
increase with a more active role. But that’s not 
all. Kevin Battle (6-5, 295) is tough to handle at 
middle guard and Coleman Rudolph returns 
at tackle. Marlon Williams plays opposite 
Coleman. Jerrelle Williams starts for the third 
season at linebacker and Willie Clay and Cur- 
ley Day return at cornerbacks. 

If that’s not enough to make foes cringe, 
Ross believes his special teams will be better, 
too. “We've got more linebacker and second- 
ary-type people in our program than ever be- 


ris ™

fore," he said. “We also have more return spe- 
cialists with speed than in the past. The poten- 
tial is there.” 

Tech gets an immediate test, facing Penn 
State in the Kickoff Classic on August 28. 
What are expected to be the toughest ACC 
tests—Virginia and Clemson—come back-to- 
back in September. Ross will know then if 
Tech has sustained. 


CLEMSON 

(10-2) The Tigers stumbled early in their first 
season under coach Ken Hatfield. They lost to 
Virginia for the first time in 30 games and 
barely escaped with a one-point victory over 
Maryland. Supporters of Danny Ford, who 
was forced to resign as coach in January of 


“Levon Kirkland 


1990 after losing a priority struggle with the 
administration, screamed in protest. But 
Clemson finished in its usual position—with 10 
victories—after bombing Illinois, 30-0, in the 
Hall of Fame Bowl. 

Some big holes, particularly on defense, 
must be filled if the Tigers are to win 10 again. 
Clemson must replace two All-Americas (of- 
fensive tackle Stacy Long and kicker/punter 
Chris Gardocki) and 10 other starters—five of 
them first- or second-team all-ACC. But talent- 
ed and experienced personne! abounds from 
a team that placed ninth in the final AP rank- 
ings. Although six starters must be replaced 
on the nation’s No. 1 defensive unit, every po- 
sition has at least one veteran who played at 
least 125 snaps last season. Twenty-one play- 
ers had 20 or more tackles, 

Linebackers Levon Kirkland and Ed 
McDaniel will be the ringleaders of the de- 
fense that attempts to match the accomplish- 
ments of the 1990 squad: first in total defense, 
second in scoring and rushing defense, and 
sixth in pass defense. Kenzil Jackson will join 
McDaniel inside, and Ashley Sheppard and 
Wayne Simmons team with Kirkland outside.

All-ACC Rob Bodine at middie guard and 
Chester McGlockton and Al Richard at tackle 
form a rugged interior, But the secondary 
need revamping. In addition to the expected 
losses, all-star junior Dexter Davis declared 
for the NFL draft. Safety Robert O'Neal is the 
only returning starter. 

Seven regulars are back on offense, and 
Hatfield expects the unit "to be a lot better.” 
Jeb Flesch and Bruce Bratton return to the 
line, and the backfield is running over with 
talent. OeChane Cameron is the incumbent at 
quarterback. He had moments of inconsisten- 
cy in 1990, but he turned in an MVP perfor- 
mance in the Hall of Fame Bowl. Sophomore 
Terry Smith and Larry Ryans top the receiving 
corps, and Ronald Williams, the all-ACC tail- 
back as a true freshman, heads an impressive 
list of running backs, Williams gained 941 
yards and scored eight TDs. 

Gardocki’s decision to enter the NFL after 
his junior season leaves two gaping holes. He 
ranked in the nation's top five in both punting 
and place-kicking. 


VIRGINIA 

(8-4) The Cavaliers enjoyed their finest sea- 
son in many years in 1990, ending the Clem- 
son jinx, playing in the Sugar Bowl, and resid- 
ing atop the national polls much of the year.

Virgpenel 
Don't expect more of the same this fail, but the 
arsenal is not empty, either. 

Coach George Welsh changed his offen- 
sive and defensive coordinators and installed 
a new look on defense. Gone is the 5-2 align- 
ment for a more attacking 4-3. Gone, too, are 
the dynamic duo of quarterback Shawn 
Moore and receiver Herman Moore, who ignit- 
ed the offense that averaged 501 yards. 

Matt Blundin, a 6-7, 230-pounder who also 
plays on the Cavaliers’ nationally ranked bas- 
ketball team, steps in at quarterback. But it’s 
not the same; after Shawn Moore suffered a 
dislocated thumb last season, Virginia lost, 
38-13, to Virginia Tech with Blundin at the 
controls. Herman Moore might be more diffi- 
cult to replace than Shawn Moore. His deci- 
sion to head for the NFL after his junior season 
leaves Virginia with receivers with a total of 16 
career catches. Tailback Terry Kirby, the 
ACC's leading rusher, with 1,020 yards, and 
Nikki Fisher (848 yards, 10 TDs) should re- 
lieve some of the pressure on Blundin. He also 
caught 33 passes for 324 yards. All-star tack- 
le Ray Roberts and guard Jeff Tomlin lead the 
offensive line. 

Linebacker P.J. Killian, the leading tackler, 
end Chris Slade, and tackle Donald Reynolds 
will lead the defense. Slade, a 6-5, 225-pound 
junior, earned all-ACC honors and had a 


team-high seven sacks. Only Tyrone Lewis, 
moving from strong safety to cornerback, re- 
tums in the secondary. 

“I don't think we have to rebuild, but there 
definitely will be some changes,” said Welsh, 
beginning his 10th season at Virginia. “We're 
going through an experimental process, but | 
think this will suit our personnel better.” 


NORTH CAROLINA 

(6-4-1) After suffering through 1-10 records in 
each of their first two seasons under coach 
Mack Brown, the Tar Heels jumped to fifth in 
the league and dam near attained their goa! of 
playing in a bowl game. With 19 regulars re- 


turning, their climb should continue. But 
Brown warns that the next step will be more 
difficult. “The problem is the strength of the 
ACC today.” Brown said. “Our team could be 
much better than four years ago and not have 
as good a record as last season.” The Tar 
Heels did not exactly beat a Who's Who in 
college football en route to six victories last 
season, but national co-champion Georgia 
Tech counted themselves fortunate to escape 
with a tie against UNC. 

The Tar Heels return more experienced per- 
sonnel than any team in the league, and the 
defense should be especially stout. Three

linebackers—Dwight Hollier and Tommy Thig- 
pen inside and Eric Gash outside—anchor the 
unit that ranked 20th in scoring defense, 23rd 
in rushing defense, and 34th in total defense. 
The defensive front, where tackle Dennis 
Tripp and middle guard Alex Simakas are 
missing, is a source of concern. But the sec- 
ondary is sound with free safety Rondell 
Jones, strong safety Cookie Massey, and cor- 
nerback Cliff Baskerville. 

Brown hopes one of his quarterbacks will 
step forward and take control. Todd Burnett 
enjoyed some success, but he also struggied. 
Chuckie Burnette played well down the 
stretch. Steve Jerry contributed to the running 
game, but he must improve his passing. Oth- 
erise, the unit is set. Guard Brian Bollinger 
paces four veterans in the interior line, and 
former quarterback Deems May has found a 
home at tight end. Corey Holliday (28 
catches, 488 yards) is a big-play man at wide 
receiver. Sophomore tailback Natrone Means 
stepped into the starting lineup at midseason 
and rushed for 849 yards and 11 touchdowns. 
Mike Faulkerson returns at fullback. 

Punter Scott McAlister and kicker Clint 
Gwaltney are solid. 

“We don't have a lot of experienced depth," 
Brown said. “We're still in position where inju- 
ries can wipe us out at any time at a key spot.”

But that’s a minor problem compared to those 
he faced a couple of years ago. He'll gladly 
accept the change. 


NORTH CAROLINA STATE 

(7-5) The Wolfpack suffered enough injuries to 
last a lifetime last season, yet still won seven 
games, including a 31-27 decision over 
Southern Miss in the All-American Bowl. The 
injuries forced coach Dick Sheridan to use 
some untested players. But the growing pains 
should be converted into dividends in 1991. A 


Finding offensive consistency is a primary 
goal this fall. Throw out a couple of track 
meets against I-AA teams that produced 123 
points, and State scored only 175 in the other 
10 games. Part of the problem could be 
traced to injuries and illness that claimed 
tackle Scott Adel! and running backs Anthony 
Barbour and Dan Hayden for the season. In 
addition to the aforementioned three, eight 
starters are back on offense. Quarterback 
Terry Jordan looks to improve on a sopho- 
more season in which he completed 101 of 


179 passes for 1,221 yards. He placed third in 
the ACC in passing efficiency and sixth in total 
offense. Aubrey Shaw, who rushed for 395 
yards, caught 34 passes for 288, and scored 
seven TDs, and Gary Downs, with 397 yards 
tushing and six TDs, return at running back. 
Leading rusher Greg Manior (406 yards), Le- 
del George, and Hayden are set at fullback. 
They will operate behind a veteran line, which 
figures to enable State to climb on the 
league's offensive chart. 

Defense is seldom a problem under Sheri- 
dan, and this year should be no exception. 
The Wolfpack placed second to Clemson last 
year, limiting foes to 278 yards and 14.7 
points a game. Outside linebacker Tyler Law- 
rence and comerback Sebastian Savage lead 
the unit that must replace two high NFL draft 
choices, tackle Mike Jones and defensive 
back Jesse Campbell. Lawrence had seven 
sacks last season and Savage placed third on 
the team with 85 tackles. 


MARYLAND 

(6-5-1) The Terps exceeded expectations 
against a schedule that included six bowl 
teams and was considered the strongest in 
the nation by USA Today. “We proved we 
could do it, and the team is.more confident 
this time around,” coach Joe Krivak said. 

To duplicate last season's success, the 
Terps must find a replacement for quarter- 
back Scott Zolak, whose 2,589 yards led the 
ACC in passing. He set records for comple- 
tions in a game and a season in a school that 
produced Boomer Esiason. The top candi- 
date is senior James Sandwisch, who com- 
pleted 12 of 22 attempts last season. The re- 
mainder of the backfield is set with sopho- 
mores Frank Wycheck and Chad Wiestling at 
H-back and Troy Jackson leading a posse of 
runners. Wycheck caught a school-record 58 
passes, 14 in one game. Jackson rushed for 
662 yards. He capped the season with three 
TDs in a 34-34 tie with Louisiana Tech in the 
Independence Bowl. Center Mitch Suplee 


atiantic 


and guard Ron Staffileno are returning start- 
ers in the line and, Krivak says, “provide a 
base of respectability.” 

Tackles Larry Webster and Lubo Zizakovic 
anchor the defensive front that Krivak believes 
“has the potential to be among the best." Cor- 
nerback Scott Rosen and safeties Ron Rea- 
gan and Mike Thomas pace the secondary. 
“Like last year, early maturity by our defense 
will take the pressure off a young offense,” 
Krivak said. 

Dan DeArmas handles all the kicking and 
he handles it well. He made 14 of 18 field 
goals and all 23 PATs and punted for a 39.5- 
yard average last seson. 


_ Troy Jackson” 
~, Maryland 
What the Terps need most, Krivak said, is a 
quarterback “to bring it all together.” Until 
they do, rate them in the middle of the league, 
and don't be surprised if they rise. 


DUKE 
(4-7) The Blue Devils struggled in their first 
season under coach Barry Wilson, and the 
reason is easy to see: defense. Or, rather, the 
lack of defense. Rivals ran with impunity, rack- 
ing up 234 rushing yards and 27 points per 
game. Statistics like those generally add up to 
something like a 4-7 record. “At times, we 
played very well,” Wilson said. “But we did not 
play consistently. What I'm hoping for this 
season is consistency.” : 

If experienced personnel translates into 
consistency, the Blue Devils are set. Seven- 


142 


teen reguiars return, 10 on defense. Outside 
linebacker Darrell Spelts, strong safety Erwin 
Sampson, middle guard Scott Youmans, and 
linebacker Duane Marks head the defense. 
Leading tackler Mark Allen (121) is the only 
absentee. The secondary led the ACC in pass 
defense (142 yards per game), but that might 
be misleading. The Duke rushing defense sel- 
dom forced rivals to the air. 

David Brown steps in at quarterback and 
directs what could be a prolific unit. Although 
Gividing time with Billy Ray, Brown threw for 
1,444 yards and finished fifth in the confer- 
ence in passing efficiency. His chief targets 
will be running back Randy Cuthbert, all- 
league wide receiver Marc Mays (35 catches, 
457 yards), and tight end Aaron Shaw (35- 
383). Walter Jones (19-352, 5 TDs) is a big- 
play receiver. Despite ailing knees, Cuthbert 
caught 48 for 374 yards to go with 595 yards 
rushing last season. Center Stuart Albright 
and guard Pete Petroff lead the line that must 
replace three starters. 


WAKE FOREST 

(3-8) Every time tailback Anthony Williams 
rushed for more than 100 yards in a game last 
season, the Demon Deacons won. The prob- 
tem, of course, is that he reached triple figures 


only three times. With 17 starters returning 
from the lineup that beat Vanderbilt, 56-28, in 
the season's finale, prospects might be look- 
ing up. However, coach Bill Dooley candidly 
notes a lack of speed. “We've got to get faster 
and tackle better,” he said. “It doesn't matter 
how strong you are: if you can't catch them. 
you can't tackle them.” 

The Deacons experienced problems 
“catching them” last season. They finished 
last in the ACC in rushing defense (235.5 
yards). scoring defense (31.9). and total de- 
fense (410.8 yards). They went 0-7 in the 
league, playing only two ACC rivals closer 
than 18 points. Williams, the ACC's best in all- 
purpose running (146 yards per game) and 
No. 5 rusher (866 yards), set a school record 
in kickoff-return yards (740) and average 
(25.5). John Henry Mills. the all-ACC tight end, 
placed third in the league in receiving, with 46 
catches for 623 yards and three TDs. The 6-1, 
220-pound junior caught 37 for 492 yards in 
the fina! six games. 

Still, to find success, the Deacons must find 
defense. “We've got a lot of people back. but 
they did not do well last year,” said Dooley, 
whose defense returns all but one regular. Ju- 
nior cornerback George Coghill is the main 
man. He led the league in punt returns (14.5- 
yard average) and tied for third in intercep- 
tions (4). Tryg Brody, second in the ACC with 
14 tackles for loss, anchors the line. 

“We have the problem that’s always been at 
Wake Forest, and that’s the lack of depth,” 
said Dooley, who enjoyed coaching success 
at North Carolina and Virginia Tech before 
moving to Wake five years ago. “We simply do 
not have the depth other teams in the ACC 
have. But there definitely has been some im- 
provement in the program. With another year 
of experience, we ought to be better.”

SOUTH CAROLINA 

(6-5) Poor defense in midseason losses to The 
Citadel and North Carolina State cost the 
Gamecocks dearly in 1990. They surrendered 
76 points in those games. and an excellent 
season shipped into mediocrity. Throw in the 
expected lashing from Florida State, and 
South Carolina yielded 117 points in three 
weeks. USC bounced back to finish with an 
impressive victory over West Virginia. and

Aldridge and Tommy West, and turned the de- 
fense over to them. 

The offense will revolve around senior quar- 
terback Bobby Fuller, who completed 58 per- 
cent of his passes for 2,372 yards and 13 TDs. 
His chief targets will be senior speedsters 
Robert Brooks (33 catches for 548 yards and 
6 TDs) and Eddie Miller (21-457-2). USC likely 
will use more of a two-back set on offense with 
sophomore Rob DeBoer (700 yards rushing), 
senior Albert Haynes (201) and redshirt fresh- 
men Cleon Jones and Terry Wilburn sharing 
the duties. Jay Killen and Antoine Rivens head 
the line that must replace tackles Ike Harris 
and Calvin Stephens. 

Seven regulars return on detense, which 
will feature a three-man line rather than the 
four-man front used last season. “Our chal- 
lenge will be getting the right players in the 
tight spot,” said Woods, who will be using his 
third defensive alignment in three seasons in 
Columbia. “We hope to have a defense that’s 
more aggressive, more on the attack along 
the line of scrimmage.”

Brown, and Marty Dye, a starler last year, are 
the top candidates al nose tackle. Returning 
starters Joe Reaves and Mike Tolbert, both 
seniors, head a deep and experienced corps 
of inside linebackers. Free safety Leon Harris 
(91 tackles, two interceptions) leads an im- 
proved secondary. 

Most of the heavyweights (Georgia Tech, 
Florida State, Clemson) come on the second 
half of the schedule, which should allow time 
for the defense to adjust to the new scheme. 


VIRGINIA TECH 

(6-5) If coach Frank Beamer can't wait for this 
season, don’t blame him. He returns 16 start- 
ers from a team that finished with a flourish: 
victories over three bowl teams and a 6-3 loss 
to national co-champion Georgia Tech in its 
tinal four games. The only negative is the 
schedule. After opening against James Madi- 
son, the Hokies play five straight on the road 
against N.C. State, South Carolina, Oklahoma, 
West Virginia, and Florida State. 

“We will be a good football team," Beamer, 
beginning his fifth season, said. “But a lot of 
things will help determine the final record. I'm 
sure no other team in college football faces a 
task [the five straight road games] that diffi- 


but Tech looks to build on the momentum es- 
tablished late last season and on the enthusi- 
asm over the school’s joining the Big East. 

The offense particularly should be strong, 
with nine starters returning. Quarterback Will 
Furrer (58.4 percent, 2,122 yards, 19 TDs) will 
trigger the attack, and he has loads of help. 
Vaughn Hebron (640 yards rushing, 289 re- 
ceiving) and Tony Kennedy (517, 209) provide 
a dynamite one-two punch at tailback and 
Marcus Mickel (38 receptions, 409 yards) 
heads the wide receivers. They will operate 
behind a line anchored by senior tackle Eu- 
gene Chung (6-5, 285) and guard William 
Boatwright. The Hokies expect Chung to be 
among the nation’s best linemen. 

Seven regulars are back on defense, but 
Tech must replace its three top ends and both 
outside linebackers. Bryan Campbell is strong 
at tackle, and Rusty Pendleton and Melendez 
Byrd return at inside linebackers. The second- 
ary should be solid with safety Damien Russell 
and corner John Granby heading the cast. 


cult.” He calls the schedule "a major hurdle,” 


EAST CAROLINA 
(5-6) The Pirates begin their third season un- 
der coach Bill Lewis, and he hopes some 
spring question marks become fall exclama- 
tion points. The presence of 14 starters, eight 
on offense, suggests stability. But only strong 
safety Derrick Fields returns to the secondary. 
“Our football team is not to the point where we 
have arrived at any position or any phase of 
our game," Lewis said. “We are a 5-6 team.” 
Senior tight end Luke Fisher (6-3, 222, all- 
South Independent) headlines the offense, 
but he missed spring drills recovering from 
ankle and shoulder injuries from the 1990 sea- 
son. He joins junior tackle Tom Scott (6-5, 330)

Jeff Blake will start at quarterback for the sec- 
ond year. He set a school record with 1,924 
yards in total offense. Leading rusher David 
Daniels (653 yards, 5 TDs) returns at one o 
the running backs. 
Senior Robert Jones (6-3, 236) ranks 
among the best at linebacker. He took part in 
167 tackles a year ago (fourth nationally and 
No. 1 among returning players) and could be- 
come the school's career leader with a similar 
season in '91. He had 17 tackles, blocked a 
field goal, and returned an interception for a 
TD against Cincinnati. Transfers Greg Gran-

dison and Aaron Harvey are expected to bol- 
ster the secondary. Grandison, who began his 
college career at Florida before transferring to 
junior college, ranked among the nation's top 
prospects in high school. Mike Bystol, another 
transfer, likely will start on the line. 


WILLIAM & MARY 

(10-3) The Indians set a bunch of single-sea- 
son school records—most victories, points 
(467), total yards (6,438), to name a few—in 
their march to the I-AA quarterfinals last sea- 
son. But some solid players in the offensive 
line must be replaced for an encore. 

Igniting the attack again will be senior quar- 
terback Chris Hake!l, who passed for 3,414 
yards and 22 touchdowns. Tailback Robert 
Green, who rushed for 1,408 yards and 19 
TDs, is back, too. They will operate behind a 
line headed by Greg Kalinyak, a 6-4, 265- 
pound center who earned second-team aca- 
demic All-America honors. Linebacker Jeff 
Nielsen, a first-team academic All-America, 
headlines the defense. 

Coach Jimmye Laycock begins his 11th 
season at the helm with a 68-56-2 record. The 
Indians have won 39 games the past five 
years and have earned I-AA playoff berths 
three times. Expect them to continue the win- 
ning tradition this fall. 


LIBERTY 
(7-4) Sam Rutigliano has guided the Flames to 
seven victories in each of his two seasons at 
the helm, and the best is yet to come. The 


res a. 


former NFL head coach returns 15 starters 
from a team that climbed to No. 8 in the na- 
tional polls before slumping. 

Triggering the offense, will be junior quarter- 
back Robbie Justino, who threw for 3,076 
yards and 24 touchdowns a year ago. He 
completed 228 of 382 passes and ranked 
among the national leaders in passing effi- 
ciency (141.3). The receiving corps includes 
L.G. Parrish (51 catches for 754 yards), Mark 
Thomas (43-648), and Pat Nelson (38-654). 
Either soph Adrian Cherry or senior Keith Vin- 
son will inherit the running-back post. Com- 
pleting the picture is a veteran line anchored 
by J.D. McDuffie and Curtis Adams. 

Linebackers and the secondary are the 
strengths of a defensive unit that returns sev- 
en regulars. Senior Bobby Green, who moves 
from free to strong safety, is the leader. He 


144 


had four interceptions and 115 tackles in 
1990. Paul Frazier and part-time starter James 
Downey will be joined at linebacker by Jeff 
Curtis, who had 115 tackles in 1989 but suf- 
fered a season-ending knee injury in the first 
game last year. Weymouth Williams returns at 
middle guard. 

The schedule is tough—Liberty opens with 
games at Boise State and Furman—but the 
Flames are well-armed for the challenge. 


JAMES MADISON 
(5-6) An inexperienced offense and a wicked 
schedule combine to make Rip Scherer's first 
head-coaching assignment most formidable. 
Scherer, who played for Lou Holtz and served 
on staffs headed by Joe Paterno, Bill Curry, 
and others, arrives from the offensive coordi- 
nator's post at Arizona and inherits 10 start- 
ers. That's a bit deceiving, though, for two of 
the offensive starters stepped into the lineup 
after injuries. 

Eriq Williams returns at quarterback. He set 
a schoo! record for total offense in 1991. but 


the 1,880 yards are skimpy by most stan- 
dards. He’s primarily a runner, and the new 
coaching staff hopes to beef up the passing 
game. Inside linebacker Shannon Vissman 
leads the Dukes’ always stout defense. He 
finished second on the squad a year ago with 
90 tackles. Strong safety Richard Grevious 


“will start for the fourth season. 


The Dukes could be pretty good and the 
record not reflect it. The schedule includes 
five |-AA playoff teams, plus Virginia Tech, Ap- 
palachian State, and Liberty. 


TOWSON STATE 

(2-9) Coach Phil Albert hopes the rash of inju- 
ries that wrecked his 1990 team will pay off 
this season. The experience gained then 
should be beneficial now. 

Albert, beginning his 20th season at Tow- 
son with a 116-81-3 record, returns 17 start- 
ers. Half of the eight on offense are linemen, 
which shouid transiate into an improved point 
of attack. Leading the offense will be top rush- 
er Robbie Jackson (670 yards, eight TDs) and 
flanker Kevin Howard (50 catches. 721 yards, 
three TDs). Finding a quarterback is the top 
priority. A pair of three-year starters, defen- 
sive back Gary Worthington and linebacker 
James Dutton, join sophomore free safety 
Aaron Bates in headlining the defense. 


southern 
FURBAN conference 


(9-4) If coach Jimmy Satterfield’s assembly 
lin@ produces another outstanding quarter- 
back, the Paladins will contend for the Division 
|-AA championship. if not, they merely will be 
very good. Furman, beaten in triple overtime 
in the I-AA quarterfinals last season, has all 
the other ingredients: five veteran offensive 
line starters, perhaps the school's best-ever 
running back, six defensive regulars, and a 
linebacker who made 180 tackles in 1989 re- 
turning from the injury list. 

Sophomore Hugh Swilling gets first crack at 
replacing quarterback Frankie DeBusk, who 
led the Paladins to a 31-6 record, three South- 
ern Conference titles, and the |-AA champion- 
ship in 1989. Swilling played eight games last 
fall, completing four of six passes for 39 yards 
and rushing 10 times for 77. He will see that 
junior tailback Cart Tremble gets the ball often. 
Tremble already ranks fifth on the school's ca- 
reer rushing list with 2,264 yards. Split end 


Donald Lipscomb heads the receivers. They 
all operate behind an experienced line !ed by 
tackle Kyle Lowery and guard Eric Walter. 
Clay Tiedeman starts at the other tackle, Paul 
Siffri at right end, and Tom Griffith at the other 
guard. B.J. Estes. at center, will be the only 
new regular. 

Middle guard Allen Edwards heads the de- 
fensive front, and Steve Norris and Kota Suttle 
are proven linebackers. Suttle made 180 tack- 
les in ‘89, but he missed three games last 
season with a knee injury. Norris stepped in 
and made 107 tackles. The Paladins sutfered 
the unexpected loss to two starters in the sec- 
ondary to academic difficulties, but all-SC 
comerback Jason Grant and strong safety 
Taylor Quarles solidify the unit. 


MARSHALL 
(6-5) The Thundering Herd experienced a 
season of extremes in their first year under 
coach Jim Donnan. On the pilus side, they 
jotted Furman, 10-7, carried high-powered 
Georgia Southern and Eastern Kentucky to 
the wire before losing by three points in each 
game, and scored 50 points against Appala- 
chian State. On the minus side, they suffered 
a three-touchdown embarrassment against 
oft-beaten East Tennessee. 

With 20 starters returning, look for the Herd 


STREET AND SMITH S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


to smooth out the rough spots and soar in the 
national rankings. Enthusiasm is high; over 
§,000 fans turned out for the spring game. For 
added motivation, Marshall opens a new 
28,000-seat stadium. Over 7,000 season tick- 
ets had been sold by April, and officials 
hoped for 10,000 by the opening game. 

Junior quarterback Michael Payton (2,453 
yards total offense) returns to trigger the at- 
tack. He passed for 2,409 yards and 12 TDs, 
completing a school-record 57.3 percent. He 
also threw 16 interceptions, a figure Donnan 
would like to see dwindle. Payton added sev- 
en rushing TDs, the most ever by a Marshall 
quarterback. Tackle Madison Sayre (6-6, 270) 
anchors the fine that paved the way for 390 
yards per game. 

Linebacker Joe Fumi-Fiamawle and end 
Jim Bernardoni head the veteran defensive 
unit that led the Southern and ranked third 
nationally, yielding only 260 yards per game a 
year ago. A key addition has been a full-time 
strength and conditioning coach. A couple of 
those losses last season came on opponents’ 
late-game drives, and Donnan believes this 
team will be stronger physically and better 
able to handle those challenges. 


THE CITADEL 

(7-5) The Bulldogs return 19 starters from a 7- 
5 squad that made the I-AA playoffs, finished 
15th in the national poll, and pulled a shocker 
over state rival South Carolina. Their target is 
to win the school’s first Southern title since 
1961. This will be the most experienced and 
talented of coach Charlie Taafte’s five Citadel

teams. He has 56 juniors and seniors on the 
roster, the most in his tenure in Charleston. 

Taaffe hopes to have a more diversified of- 
fense this fall. The proven wishbone remains, 
but some split-back veer has been added to 
the mix in an effort to achieve balance. The 
rasult: over 600 yards in the spring game. Op- 
erating the option altack will be senior Jack 
Douglas, who rushed for 802 yards and 13 
TDs last season. He also passed for 727 out of 
the wishbone. Junior fulloack Everette Sands 
(839 yards rushing) and sophomores Ray 
Wimbush (390, 5 TDs) and Erick Little (416, 3 
TDs) lead a deep corps of running backs. 
Cornell Caldwell (21 catches, 410 yards) and 
Willie Jones head the receivers. The line fea- 
tures all-Southern tackle Carey Cash. Pai 
Chapman retums at center after suffering an 
opening-game knee injury. 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


Middle guard Geren Williams and tackle 
Tracy Thompson spark what could be the 
school's best defensive line in years. And all- 
Southern strong safety Lester Smith heads the 
secondary that returns intact. Finding line- 
backers to replace All-America J.J. Davis and 
four-year Dwayne Smalls is the Bulldogs’ chief 
task. Rob Briggs and Ed McFarland earned 
the jobs in the spring. 


APPALACHIAN STATE 

(6-5) The Mountaineers overcame a wicked 
schedule and a weak offense to finish above 
.500 and place second in the league. Coach 
Jerry Moore’s hopes to improve upon the re- 
cord depend on development of the offensive 
line and inside linebackers. 

Moore spent the spring seeking ways to im- 
prove an offense that ranked last in the South- 
ern in 1990. He shuffled personnel and 
worked to open the attack in an effort to avoid 
a repeat of last year's stacked defenses 
against the run. Quarterback D.J. Campbell 
(1,409 yards total offense) and leading rush- 
ing J.K. Reaves (634 yards) return. 

Even though three lettermen moved to of- 
fense, the defense that ranked second in the 
Southern remains strong. Two-time all-SC ju- 
nior tackle Avery Hall heads the line. Junior 
outside linebacker Rico Mack is another all- 
conference performer, and the return of Gary 
Dandridge strengthens the secondary. Dan- 
dridge, all-SC in 1989, missed last season on 
suspension. He's returned heavier (225) and 
quicker (4.39 in the 40). 

The schedule is more favorable this season. 
Rather than three I-A teams early, Clemson is 
the only impossible task in September. 


VIRGINIA MILITARY 

(4-7) The Keydets continue to build and 
coach Jim Shuck, beginning his third season, 
believes his program has advanced “to the 
point where we can be successful in the 
Southern Conference.” He bases his opti- 
mism on improvement at the skill positions 
and increased speed on defense. The depth 
chart shows 18 returning starters, including 
10 on offense, and 39 of the top 44 players 
from the 1990 finale. 

Quarterback Tony Scales returns to direct 
VMI's wishbone, which ranked first in the 
Southern and fifth nationally in rushing (269 
yards per game). Halfbacks Marcus Mines 
and Scott Council head a corps of running 
backs that includes 10 with at least 100 yards 


rushing last season. Tight end Dan Lyle and 
center Lorenzo Carpenter lead the line. 

Tackles Dap Tillery and Mike Perfetti and 
end Raymond Flowers ail will be starting for 
their third seasons on the defensive front. Mid- 
dle linebacker Corey Jones, a former strong 
safety, is the only newcomer to the starting 
defense. Tony Woods and Andy Andrews are 
solid at outside linebacker and Todd Washing- 
ton al strong safety. 

The schedule is tougher: A pair of I-AA 
teams have replaced NAIA foes. Neverthe- 
less, the Keydets will be shooting for their first 
winning season in a decade. Defense holds 
the key. VMI scored plenty (251 points) fast 
season but gave up more (346). 


TENNESSEE-CHATTANOOGA 

(6-5) The Moccasins can look back on 1990 
and wonder what might have been. Close 
losses to Georgia Southern (23-20) and Ap- 
palachian State (23-17) ended their hopes of 
coming back from a 1-3 start to earn a berth in 
the playoffs. 

Coach Buddy Nix must now rebuild his tra- 
ditionally tough defense, which fost eight start- 
ers—including five who made either first- or 
second-team all-Southern. That shifts the bur- 
den to the offense, which just might be able to 
carry the load. The top rushers return: Mu- 
hammed Shamsid-Deen (916 yards, third in 
the Southern) and James Roberts (764, sixth). 
Opening holes will be a line headed by tackle 
Tommy Bonapart and guard Mike Duggar. But 
the quarterback will be new; Stan Nix and’ 


The new defensive alignment wil be a 4-3, 
and both Albert Luke and Sean McMahan 
shift from end to linebacker and Walt Williams 
moves from tight end to linebacker. Luke, cor- 
nerback Jackie Washington, and linebacker 
Truett Moss are the lone returning starters. 
Both specialists return. Punter Pumpy Tudors 
averaged 44.6 yards to lead the conference 
and rank third nationally. Kicker Rodney Ailen 
scored 63 points to place fifth in the league.

Wake Forest. Three of the next four games are 
against teams that made the !-AA playoffs: 
Furman, The Citadel, and Georgia Southern. 
The Catamounts finished seventh in the 
league in offense and last in defense. The lat- 
ter especially needs repair, having surren- 
dered 33 points per game. Linebacker Myron 
Sharpe leads the cast of eight veteran starters 
that includes tackles Chad Ross and Frank 
Thompson and middie guard Tony Johnson. 
All four starters are back in the secondary. 
Quarterback Lonnie Galtoway and tailback 
Kevin Thigpen (517 yards rushing) are among 
eight returning offense regulars. Tackle Eric 
Lautzenheiser and guard Todd Harkins, both 
second-team all-SC, lead the line. 


EAST TENNESSEE STATE 

(2-9) The Buccaneers suffered through one of 
those best-forgotten seasons in 1990, yet 
pulled one of the Southern’s most astonishing 
upsets. They thrashed Marshall, which had 
beaten Furman and lost to Georgia Southern 
by three points. 


Coach Don Riley finds 14 starters among 41 


’ lettermen and anticipates better days. But six 


players, including leading rusher Derrick Hol- 
lins (935 yards), missed spring drills on sus- 
pension. Inside linebacker Murphy Duckett 
(127 tackles) is perhaps the Buccaneers’ best 
Player and cornerback Mo Kelly came on 
strong late in the season. Randy Meredith 
(1,858 yards passing) retums to lead the of- 
fense. He completed 62.3 percent and fin- 
ished 20th nationally in passing efficiency.

NORTH CAROLINA A&T 

(9-2, 5-1) When he was hired at North Carolina 
A&T; everyone figured it would just be a mat- 
ter of time before coach Bill Hayes had the 
Aggies back among the league's contenders. 
But just about no one figured it would happen 
So quickly. The Aggies charged through their 
1980 schedule, winning five straight games to 
open the year and capturing four of their last 


five to finish the year 9-2. This season, A&T will 
go from being the hunter to the hunted. 

The man who makes the Aggies go is quar- 
terback Connell Maynor. The 6-foot senior 
showed flashes of brilliance as a sophomore 
before putting everything together last sea- 
son. Maynor completed 64 percent of his 
passes for 1,699 yard and 16 touchdowns. He 
also ran for 11 touchdowns, punted, and 
came up with the big play every time A&T 
needed one. But it doesn’t stop there. Kevin 
Acker, the league's fourth-leading rusher, and 
Barry Turner lead a deep running-back corps, 
all-league tight end Craig Thompson heads 
the receivers and center Richard Lide a 
young but proven offensive line. 


Though A&T's offense was very productive, 
the key to last season's success was the de- 
fense, which allowed a paltry 75 points to six 
league opponents. End Knox Thompson was 
a first-team all-MEAC choice, as was back 
Dee Moye. End Kevin Little will help anchor 
the line; Chad Armstrong, Reggie Glover, and 
Rodney Edwards will head a quality group of 
tinebackers; Sam Davis, Alonza Barnett, and 
Tommy McCoy are back in the secondary 
along with Dee Moye. 


FLORIDA A&M 

(6-0, 7-4) The Rattlers stumbled out of the 
gate last season, but got themselves together 
in time for the conference season and rolled 
through their MEAC slate unbeaten to win the 
championship. FAMU will have some big 
holes to fill, but should still have enough fire- 
power to finish near the top of the league. 
Quarterback Tony Ezell. who is already the 
school's all-time passing leader, is back for 
what should be a big senior season. As a ju- 
nior, Ezell ted the MEAC in passing (2.302 
yards) and total offense. He'll have a trio of 
talented receivers to throw to in Tim Daniel, 
Terry Mickens, and James Thurman, who 
combined for 66 catches last year. Pat Red- 
dick and Johnathon Jones will be the running 
backs and Wally Williams heads the line. 


STREET AND SMITHS CCLLEGE FOOTBALL 


Though they have the offensive tools, the 
Rattlers lost five key performers on defense. 
James McDuffy, Maress Scott, Dexter Not- 
tage, and Sean Brantley comprise most of the 
line, while Craig Hall and William Carroll are 
proven safeties. But if FAMU is the repeat as 
MEAC champs, its cornerbacks and lineback- 
ers must come through and place-kicker Jim- 
my Vertuno must be replaced. 


DELAWARE STATE 

(4-2, 7-3) The Hornets led the nation's Division 
I-AA schools in rushing last year and will once 
again field a talented, run-oriented team. Del- 
aware State returns four of its top five running 
backs. All-MEAC performer Michael Murray 
ran for 708 yards in just eight games last sea- 
son and teammate Doug Reed averaged 8.3 
yards per carry. Herb White and Wendell Wat- 
son will also see plenty of action. The depar- 
ture of Curtis Williams leaves the quarterback- 
ing spot up in the air. Erik Jones played some 
last year and may have a slight edge, but 
Jerome Chambers will push him for time. 

The Hornets should put points on the board, 
but defensively there are some gaps. Jason 
Winfield is one of just two starting linemen 
back and the linebacking is almost complete- 
ly depleted. James Redding leads four return- 
ing starters in the secondary. 


HOWARD 

(3-3, 6-5) Howard got off to a 5-0 start before a 
tough loss to Virginia State set the stage for a 
disappointing finish. It lost five of its last six 
games and finished fourth in the league. But 
Howard has the weapons to make up for last 
year's closing slump. 

The Bison return one of the league's better 
backfields in junior fullback Ryan Heathcock 
and tailback J.J. Carpenter. Heathcock ran for 
716 yards and 10 touchdowns while Carpen- 
ter added 455 yards. Quarterback Donald 
Carr, who put nearly 1,700 yards of total of- 
fense on the board, is also back but will be 
pushed hard by sophomore Chris Dubose. 
Charles Harrell, Mike Caswell, and George 
Humes give the Bison excellent receivers, 
while all-MEAC performer Nigel Greene (320), 
Robert Carpenter (255), Dante Reed, and 
Pau! Ramseur (285) head the line. If coach 
Steve Wilson has a significant hole to fill, it's 
for place-kicker Gary Mossop, who connect- 
ed on 12 of 18 field goals last season and 
gave the Bison offense an added weapon. 

On defense, Ronald Smith and James 
Spears will attempt to fill the sizable shoes of 
standout linemen Brian Taltoan and Gary Wit- 
tingham. The linebackers, led by Kenneth 
Newsome and Anthony Hooper, are also in 
good shape and Waiter Price and Keith Han- 
cock had big seasons in the secondary. 


SOUTH CAROLINA STATE 

(2-4, 4-6) The Bulldogs had great expecta- 
tions for 1980 but were derailed early when 
they lost their returning quarterback to some 
off-the-field problems before the season even 
Started. S.C. State never really recovered. 
This year, one of coach Willie Jeffries’s first 
tasks will be to find a quarterback. Redshirt 
sophomore Robert Hemby, who started five 
games, has a slight edge on Marvin Marshall 
and Jasper Brooks, but that could change. 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


The running backs, despite the loss of leading 
rusher John Brown, are very good: Dion Sum- 
mers, Orian Lumpkin, Antonio Mackey, and 
speedster Heanon Tate. But finding the holes 
may be difficult early on because State lost 
three of its five starting linemen. 

The Bulldogs should field a solid defensive 
unit. Safety Ricky Hill, who had a school-re- 
cord nine interceptions last season, returns. 
Gregory Henderson, Robert Porcher, and Da- 
mien Moses are the backbone of the line, 
while Gilbert Turnman and Henry Graham are 
solid at linebacker. If the Bulldogs have a 
need, it's in the kicking game. 


BETHUNE-COOKMAN 
(1-5, 4-7) The Wildcats have been a passing 
team for the last several years and because of 
their athletic ability at the skill positions, they 
have always been dangerous. This year will 
be no different. Quarterback J.D. Hall heads 
the list of retumees. Last season, the junior 
completed 175 of 372 passes for 2,206 yards 
and 11 touchdowns. If he can cut down on his 
17 interceptions, he'll be even more produc- 
tive. Hall and receiver Jeff Parker give Be- 
thune one of the most potent punches in the 
league. Parker, an all-MEAC choice, had 58 
catches and six touchdowns last year. Troy 
Grant, another good receiver, and Andre 
Howard, a tight end who has been converted 
to tailback, are also back, as are linemen An- 
dre Ragin and Anthony Bingham. 
Defensively, Bethune must replace line- 
backer Cedric McKinnon, who fed the league 
in tackles. Nose guard Walt Simmons and 
linebacker Tim Thompson must perform weil 
in order for the Wildcats to be competitive. 
Evan Toney, a quality performer since his 
freshman season, is now a senior and will be 
the backbone of the secondary. 


MORGAN STATE 

(0-6, 1-10) The Bears suffered through a 
tough 1990 campaign, and if it hadn't been for 
a 2-0 victory at Cheyney University in a driving 
rainstorm in the last game of the year, Morgan 
would've gone oh-for-the-season. Ricky 
Gidds, a former assistant coach at the Air 
Force Academy, takes over the coaching 
teins this season, and he will be greeted by all 
11 retuming offensive starters. 

Orlando Persell, a part-time starter at quar- 
terback last year, will try to jump-start an al- 
tack that generated just 131.5 yards per game 
and finished last in total offense. He'll have a 
bevy of quality receivers to work with, includ- 
ing preseason All-America Glenny Moore, 
Charles Harris, and slotback Sean Nelson. 
Nathan Ayers moved over from linebacker in 
midseason and gained 310 yards as a run- 
ning back, and James Ledbetter (6-6, 250) is 
the key returnee in an experienced line. Mor- 
gan will also have an added weapon in punt- 
er/place-kicker Michael Andrews, a second- 
team all-MEAC performer. 

Defensively, the Bears lost MEAC Piayer of 
the Year James Dozier but still return capable 
performers. Matthew Steple stepped in as a 
freshman and delivered 52 tackles and four 
sacks. Outside linebacker Reno Lucas led the 
team in tackles and cornerback Eddie Hill and 
safety Horace Minnifield should have good 
years in the secondary.

Rivalries continued trom page 14 


Army meets Navy. “Sut it’s also drilled into 
you.” he said. “You hear about it when you 
first arrive, how the lowest dog on the post 
ranks above the highest admiral at the Naval 
Academy... . 

“It seems to me that USC and UCLA play 
better in their big game than others play in 
their big games.” Smith said. “There’s not the 
depth to it. There's not the feeling that they 
must win to survive.” 

Smith remembered Alabama's trip into 
Auburn, and the hundreds of peopie waiting 
outside the stadium. and the feeling of how 
important a football game seemed. “It just 
permeated ail of tife in the state,” he said. “I'll 
never forget driving in on the bus. and the 
people just screaming. but doing so side-by- 
side. They weren't fighting when they were 
close enough to be fighting.” The observer 
within Smith feels that USC and UCLA have 
more fun. But the coach within wishes he 
could have one more chance to play Auburn. 

Smith had access to one additional rivalry 
when he enrolled at Harvard Divinity School 
after leaving West Point. But he did not see the 
Crimson play against Yale. “! was probably in 
the library at the time,” he said. 


The future of Penn State's rivalries never 
seemed more awkward than the afternoon last 
February when athletic directors from eight 
eastern schools appeared in Providence, RI. 
to announce the formation of the new Big East 
football conference. After all the meeting and 
cajoling Paterno had done, in an attempt to 
create some structure to the eastern indepen- 
dents, his absence seemed strange. “It was a 
little strange to me, too,” he said. “The way I'm 
trying to look at it. we're an eastern football 
team and we're trying to represent the east in 
the Big Ten. I'm an easterner, and I'm never 
going to be anything but an easterner.” 

If nothing else, the direction has changed, 
with new challenges waiting to the west. On 
that platform in Providence appeared helmets 
from Syracuse and Pittsburgh, long-time op- 
ponents that will not be a part of Penn State's 
future. Paterno said that the demands of a Big 
Ten schedule made a Pittsburgh game im- 
possible to arrange, at least for now. 

“We've had to make so many moves and 
adjustments to make that happen,” he said. 
“And we've had commitments to people. We 
had to say we can't do anything with Pitt now 
As we work out a pattern, we'll have a chance 
to sit back and see.” 

Maybe as soon as 1996, Paterno said. Pitt 
could be brought back on the schedule. But 
even then, a return would have to come near 
the beginning of the season. The thought of 
Penn State and Pittsburgh playing before 
spectators in shirt-sleeves is almost as hard to 
envision as the idea of them not playing at ail. 

It remains to be seen whether the possible 
reward of a trip to Pasadena will create 
enough incentive for Nittany Lion fans to antic- 
ipate end-of-season games against North- 
western and Michigan State with the same in- 
tensity as they felt for games with Pitt. Paterno 
feels the Pittsburgh fans will be fine. “They 
can say. ‘We should have beaten Penn State. 
We're better,’ “ he said. But he acknowledged 
that while the fans will be able to raise those 
questions, they will no longer receive their 
annual answers. Oo

The Division li team of the 1980s looked 

very much like a team for the 1990s last 
December in Florence, AL, winning its fifth na- 
tional championship in eight years. North Da- 
kota State, as it has done so often to other 
championship-game opponents, steamrolled 
Indiana, PA, 51-11, behind the play of Harlon 
Hill Award winner Chris Simdorn, an unrelent- 
ing option attack, and a defense that gives up 
yards and points about as easily as a yard 
dog gives up a bone. The combination added 


up to a perfect 14-0 season. 


“We've been able to perform relatively well 
over the past few years, but we have a saying 
here that you're only as good as your last ac- 
complishment,” said coach Rocky Hager. 
“And our last accomplishment was in Decem- 
ber, 1990. This is 1991. Yesterday is history.”

Yesterday or not, at North Dakota State suc- 
cess is the norm. The Bison. who in the last 11 
seasons have won 117 games, been in the 
playoffs nine times, and captured five cham- 
pionships, remain the team to beat in Division 
ll. Although part of the ‘90 team’s nucleus is 
gone, Hager noted, “We don't exactly have a 
complete cupboard, but it’s not bare, either.” 
As good as the offense was in 1990 (38.7 
ppg), the defense was even better, allowing 
only 13.9 points per game. With eight starters 
back, including All-America candidate Tony 
Wash, who had six quarterback sacks in the 
championship game, this year’s Bison should 
be at least as good as the bunch that did not 
give up a rushing touchdown in the last 37 
quarters of 1990. It all adds up to trouble for 
those other 125 Division !! teams looking to 
unseat North Dakota State. 

When looking for a team to challenge NDSU 
as national champions, consider Pittsburg 
State, which has won 55 straight regular-sea- 
son games. North Dakota State needed two 
touchdowns in the final five minutes of its 
semifinal game with the Gorillas to earn a 
berth in the championship in 19960, finally nail- 
ing down a 39-29 victory. 

With 16 returning starters, Pittsburg State 
coach Chuck Broyles is excited. "We came 
close to winning the national championship 
last year and we didn’t lose many players,” 
Broyles said. “We lost some quality players in 
key positions that will affect the personality of 
this year's team, but | think we're capable of 
competing on the national level again.” 

Pittsburg State will be operating without its 
starting quarterback from the last three years, 


Jay Padden, who fashioned a 35-3 record and 
set school records for career completion per- 
centage and TD passes. Turning over the na- 
tion's third-ranked scoring (41.5 ppg) and 
second-ranked rushing (325.2 yards) offense 
to either Todd Hunter or Brian Hutchins won't 
be difficult for Broyles because twin 1,000- 
yard rushers Darren Dawson (1,415) and Ron- 
ald Moore (1.013) are back. Said offensive 
coordinator Jerry Kill of the two running 
backs, “I don't know if they're the best pair of 
running backs in the nation, but if they aren't, | 
wouldn't want to play against the team who 
has the best because Moore and Dawson are 
pretty darn good “ Pittsburg State is nearly as 
talented defensively, with eight starters back 
on a team that ranked in the top 20 in three 
categories: rushing defense, total defense, 
and scoring defense. With solid depth all 


around, it won't take much for the Gorillas to 
end up playing for the national championship. 

The first goa! for the 1991 East Texas State 
football team is to repeat as champions in the 
Lone Star Conterence. After that, however, the 
team’s goal is much loftier. The Lions want a 
national championship. With 17 starlers re- 
turning, coach Eddie Vowell is confident East 
Texas State can contend for a championship. 
Last year’s LSC title team went 7-0 in league 
play and made it all the way to the Division II 
quartertinals before seeing the national title 
goal slip away. The term “unfinished busi- 
ness” is heard often around the East Texas 
program, starting with Vowell. 

“Our players want to repeat as conference 
champions and we feel like we have some 
unfinished business to take care of. But we've 
definitely got our work cut oul for us.” he said. 
Improving on last year's 36.2 scoring average 
appears difficult, but with 10 starters back at 
nine positions, the Lions would seem more 
than capable. Heading the offensive unit is all- 


STREET AND SMITH S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


conference quarterback Bob Bounds, a se- 
nior who broke the school's total-offense mark 
in 1990 with 2,103 yards. When the Lions run 
the bail, it's usually behind All-America tackle 
Dwayne Phorne, back for his senior season. 
On defense, the secondary shouldn't be a 
problem. All-America cornerback Eric Turner 
led Division II with 10 interceptions a year ago 
as a sophomore. All-LSC senior safety Jimmy 
Hooxer picked off eight. 

Don't be surprised to see Indiana (PA) back 
in the picture for a national championship 
again in 1991. The Indians lost only two 
games in 1990—both to North Dakota State. 
Sixteen of the Indians’ 24 starters return, in- 
cluding two All-Americas. Quarterback Tony 
Aliucci and split end Andrew “Jai” Hill teamed 
up as one of the top pass-and-catch combi- 
nations in the country last year and return for 


their senior campaigns. Aliucci led the nation 
in passing efficiency, while Hill led the nation 
in scoring and had 20 TDs on 60 catches. 

North Alabama would like nothing better 
than to play a championship game in Braly 
Stadium—its home field. The dream could 
easily become reality. Coach Bobby Wallace 
has seen his team improve in each of his three 
seasons (from 2-8 to 8-3) and last year the 
Lions gol a taste of the playoffs. North Ala- 
bama returns 16 starters, including nine on 
defense. Two players to watch are tackle O.J. 
Patrick and free safety Harvey Summerhill. Of- 
fensively, Craig Bryant, a two-year starter at 
quarterback, signed a contract with the Seat- 
tle Mariners. Seven of the top eight runners 
are also back, in addition to Tyrone Rush, the 
team’s top rusher in 1989. 

Grand Valley State has a new head coach, 
Brian Kelly, but a familiar cast of characters. 
The Lakers have won two straight conference 
championships (the last Great Lakes Confer- 
ence and the first Midwest Intercollegiate 


STREET ANO SMITH’S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


Football Conference), 21 of their last 22 regu- 
lar-season games, and been to the playoffs 
two straight seasons. With 24 players who 
started games last year back, the transition for 
Kelly shouldn't be too difficult. 

“We'll be very similar to what we've been,” 
said Kelly. “To the average fan, we probably 
won't look much different.” 

Running back and conference player of the 
year Eric Lynch is back along with quarter- 
back Jack Hull. The two have combined for 
113 touchdowns, including a school-record 
53 by Lynch. Conference lineman of the year 
Chris Tiede opens the holes for Lynch. 

Edinboro seems in good shape to make a 
third straight trip to the playoffs after last 
year's 9-3 record, as 16 starters return for 
fourth-year coach Tom Hollman. The fighting 
Scots, though, must replace Harlon Hill run- 
ner-up Ernest Priester at wide receiver. Help- 
ing in that regard, however, are All-Americas 
Curtis Rose (OT) and running back Lester 
Frye (1.630 yards). 

Independent Wofford's first-ever NCAA 
playoff appearance was cut short by Missis- 
sippi College (70-19), but the Terriers still fin- 
ished 9-3. One reason head coach Mike 
Ayers can smile even though he lost 11 start- 
ers is that junior Shawn Graves is back at 
quarterback. Graves is the leading candidate 


—, 


for the Harlon Hill Award after compiling 2,807 
yards and 41 touchdowns in two seasons. 
Projected over four years, his numbers would 
shatter five NCAA records, including most 
points and touchdowns in a career. 

Texas A&l found life after three-time Harlon 
Hill Award winner Johnny Bailey difficult, man- 
ufacturing only a 6-4 record and missing out 
on the playoffs. That will change in 1991 as 
the Javelinas, along with East Texas and An- 
gelo State, are favored to finish 1-2-3 in the 


Lone Star Conference. Although only 19 letter- 
men return, coach Ron Harms will rely on 22 
redshirts and 11 transfers to provide immedi- 
ate help. The Javelinas love to run, and Harms 
has stockpiled some geod backs who will do 
most of their running behind 6-3, 309-pound 
tackle Brian Neilson. 

Virginia Union always seems to be around 
the top 10 and 1991 shouldn't be any differ- 
ent. The Panthers got a CIAA Player of the 
Year performance from Carl Wright (2,725 
yards passing, 21 TD) and have six other all- 
CIAA players coming back with him. 

The rest of the top 25 is as wide open as the 
top 10. Any number of teams will challenge for 
playoff berths, including Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo. The Mustangs won 10 of 12 games in 
1990, losing in the second round of the play- 
offs to eventual champion North Dakota State.

Cal Poly SLO didn’t have to score a ton of 
points to win those 10 games. The Mustangs 
either led the country or were second in every 
major team defensive category. 

Jacksonville State has been in the playoffs 
three straight years, but if the Gamecocks 
want to make it four in a row, coach Bill Bur- 
gess will have to find replacements for 12 
starters, including quarterback David Gul- 
ledge (34-8 as a starter). “It's sure going to be 
different without David around,” said Burgess. 
“But he also took a lot of quality, experienced 
players with him.” Nicky Edmondson has the 
inside track at replacing Gulledge. The lead- 
ing rusher, Terrence Bowens (775 yards), re- 
turns. John Sanders made 109 tackles fast 
season and is back for a final season.

A third member of the Lone Star Confer- 
ence, Angelo State, could crack the playoffs. 
The Rams, 7-3 a year ago, will look to veteran 
linemen on both sides of the ball to keep 
things going until their inexperienced running 
backs become accustomed to the system. 
Two veteran receivers (Darron Johnson, Ken- 
neth Washington) should help quarterbacks 
Danny Keeton and Greg Stephens. 

Like the LSC, the Western Football Confer- 
ence should be tightly bunched at the top. Cal 
State Northridge coach Bob Burt has stated 
three specitic goals for 1991: a sixth straight 
winning season, the first outright WFC title, 
and a second straight playoff appearance. To 
accomplish those goals, Burt will have to re- 
place Albert Fann, the school's all-time lead- 
ing rusher, and four all-WFC performers. Also, 
Cal State Northridge faces seven road 
games, including contests at defending co- 
champ Cal Poly SLO, Portiand State, and 
NCC defending champ Cal-Davis. 

When you talk about Tuskegee, the focus 
automatically shifts to the Harlon Hill Award 
candidate quarterback Maurice Heard. Only a 
junior, Heard is coming off a season where he 
accumulated 2,974 yards and 34 touchdowns 
on 182 completions in 359 attempts. Heard, 
the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Confer- 
ence Player of the Year, is one of 16 starters 
back for Jim Martin's Golden Tigers. Scoring 
shouldn't be a problem. With Heard calling 
signals and fellow Sheridan All-America 
Christopher Holder doing most of the catch-

ing (54, 1,088, 14 TDs), Tuskegee averaged 
37 points per game while going 8-3. 

Miltersvilie was a perfect 5-0 in the Eastern 
Division of the Pennsytvania Conference a 
year ago, but it had to come from behind in 
four of those games. The nucleus of the team 
remains (30 lettermen), including safety An- 
thony Devine, a second-team All-America. 
The Marauders also have quarterback Chris 
Fagan (2,065 passing yards) and running 
back Ron Porter (753 yards rushing, 454 re- 
ceiving yards, 9 TDs) back. 

Portiand State, an annual visitor to the Divi- 
sion II playoffs, missed out for the first time in 
four years in 1990 and will be looking for some 
sort of redemption. Pokey Allen’s teams al- 
ways seem to feature a great quarterback (the 
school has produced All-Americas June 
Jones, Neil Lomax, Chris Crawford, and Dar- 
ren Del'Andrae) and the Vikings could turn 
over the offense this season to junior-college

standout John Chartes. A transfer from Foothill 
Junior College, Charles passed for a juco- 
record 6,300 yards in two seasons. 

Mississippi College is two years removed 
from a national championship and is trying for 
a fourth consecutive playoff berth. If it hap- 
pens it will be because the Choctaws have 
found replacements for sixth-round NFL draft 
pick Fred McAfee (1,583 yards, 18 touch- 
downs) and Nathaniel Bolton (58 catches, 676 
yards, 9 TDs). Kyle Morris has transferred in 
after a stint with Florida. That should help the 
Choctaws because incumbent quarterback 
Dexter Roulhac broke his leg in the spring. 

Northeast Missouri State, after being 
picked for eighth in the Missouri Intercolle- 
giate Athletic Association, was a Division II 
playoff participant in 1990. To duplicate that 
9-2 performance, the Bulldogs need to find a 
Quarterback and replacements for eight de- 
fensive starters. Chris Livingstone, a transfer 
from Missouri, could be the answer at quarter- 
back, and he'll have 10 starters from last year 
surrounding him. The Bulldogs were 13th in 
passing and tight end Fontaine Walker (55 
catches, 9 TD) was one reason why. 

UC Davis has won 20 straight Northem Cal- 
ifornia Athletic conference titles and enters 
1991 on a five-game winning streak. No won- 
der head coach Bob Foster is confident. Mike 
Shepard, an all-NCAC selection at tackle and 
a 3.9 GPA student in biochemistry, spear- 
heads an experienced defense. 

In another feague Northem Colorado might 
be a solid choice to finish first. In the North 
Central Conference, the Bears must face the 
reality of playing second fiddle to North Dako- 
ta State. Two of their four losses were to the 
national champion Bison, but with 17 starters 
back, maybe it's their time to displace NDSU. 
Northern Colorado and North Dakota State 
hook up October 26 in Greeley, CO. 

It hasn't taken Dave Dolch long to turn 
around Momingside football. Last season. 
the Chiefs finished 7-4, cause for celebration 
when you consider it was just the third winning 
season in the last 19. Like Northern Colorado, 
though, Morningside has to contend with 
North Dakota State, among others. But the 
Chiefs have seven starters back on a defense 
that showed considerable improvement. 

Winston-Salem State University has be- 
come the dominant force in the Centra! Inter- 
collegiate Athletic Association, winning three 
of the last four league championships. Quar- 
terback Mitch Nicholson, who finished second 
in the nation in passing efficiency, and an ex- 
perienced backfield could enable the Rams to 
make it four titles in five years 

If Millersville slips in the Eastern Division of 
the Pennsylvania Conference, East Strouds- 
burg should be ready to move into the top 
spot. After two consecutive 6-4 seasons, Den- 
ny Douds' Warriors appear ready to improve a 
notch. If East Stroudsburg is to step up to the 
next level, it will be done primarily with a high- 
powered offense that returns eight starters. 
The Warriors averaged 28.3 points per game, 
their highest figure in 12 years. 

Independent American International could 
be ready to step into the Division II playoffs. 
After posting consecutive 7-3 records over 
the past two seasons, Alex Rotsko's Yellow 
Jackets return 18 starters and appear primed 
to improve. But the fact remains, everyone is 
chasing North Dakota State. It's a race that 
might not be winnable. Oo

National Preview 


by PETE ZAPADKA 


PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE 


There will be plenty of new faces on the 

football field this season for Division Hil 
defending champion Allegheny College (13- 
0-1). That news, however, is not necessarily 
bad for second-year coach Ken O'Keefe. Last 
fall, Allegheny returned just 11 starters and 
was, at best, a long shot in the race for the 
Division Ill title. Yet the Gators managed to 
pull off the surprise, culminating their champi- 
onship run with a come-from-behind 21-14 
overtime victory over Lycoming College in the 
Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl. 

This season, O'Keefe has just 10 starters 
back and plenty of holes to fill. He must, for 
instance, find a replacement for quarterback 
Jeff Filkovski, the Division tll Offensive Player 
of the Year, who passed for 2,152 yards and 
22 touchdowns. Filkovski's probable succes- 
sor is Ben Cammarano, who saw very limited 
duty last season but is said to be a more accu- 
rate passer than Filkovski. Flanker Julio La- 
cayo, who had 40 receptions for 708 yards 
and 10 TDs in 1990, is the top target. Tight 
end Kurt Reiser, who caught the game-win- 
ning TD pass against Lycoming, also returns. 

The Gators’ biggest offensive threat will be 
tailback Stanley Drayton. The 5-9, 170-pound 
junior is billed as “The Bottle Rocket” because 
his speed and versatility are reminiscent of 
former Notre Dame back Raghib “Rocket” Is- 
mail. Drayton split time at tailback with Jerry 
O'Brien last season and rushed for 633 yards 
and eight touchdowns. He also caught 10 
passes for 146 yards and returned six kickoffs 
for 155 yards. 

“Stan hasn't come close to his potential 
yet,” said O'Keefe. “We know any time Stan- 
ley touches the ball, he has the ability to 
score. He has great athletic ability and his 
speed separates him from other players.” 

The Gators’ defense will be anchored by 
linebackers Wayne Mack, who.had a team- 
high 140 tackles last year, and Darren Had- 
lock. Tony Bifulco, a two-time honorable men- 
tion All-America cornerback, is the only starter 
back in the secondary. 

“It's much the same as going into last year,” 
O'Keefe said. “There are places where we're 
going to have to grow up fast and other places 
where we have experience and depth.” 

Ohio Westeyan (9-1) shoutd be the biggest 
challenge for Allegheny during the North 
Coast Athletic Conference's regular season. 
The Battling Bishops led the nation in rushing 
defense (18.9 yards per game), were third in 
total defense (153.7 yards per game), and 
fifth in scoring defense (6.6 points per game). 
Senior nose guard Keith Rucker, an Associat- 
ed Press Little All-America who had nine quar- 
terback sacks in 1990, returns to anchor the 
line. Rucker will be joined by tackles Eric Ab- 
bot and Chris LeFevre. Doug Dean and Mark 
Serfilippi return to the linebacking corps and 
comerback Paul Williams and safety Terry 
Mee solidify the secondary. OWU returns 
soph Jim Clark at quarterback and Rob 
Gause (619 yards) at halfback, with Steve Al- 
exander to take over at fullback. 


STREET AND SMITH'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL 


Wittenberg (7-3), another perennial nation- 
al power, could have a say in the race for the 
NCAC title. The Tigers return 33 lettermen, 
including talented quarterback Matt Martin, 
tight end Mark Berkich, center Jeff Forikamp, 
and wide receiver Chris Hill, who also is a 
dangerous kickoff returner. The defense has 
eight returning starters, led by end David 
Radcliffe and back Shawn Owens. Place-kick- 
er Greg Brame and punter Jeff Black also are 
back. The key concern for coach Doug Nei- 
buhr will be to find a raplacement for All-Amer- 
ica tailback Jon Warga, the NCAC Offensive 
Player of the Year and the nation’s leading 
rusher (1,836 yards). 

If Dayton (11-1) can find a suitable raplace- 
ment for departed quarterback Dan Shaley, 
the Flyers should be bound for the playoffs 
again. Coach Mike Kelly may opt for junior 
Steve Keller, out three sophomores also will 
challenge for the position. When the quarter- 
back is settled, Dayton has its offensive cata- 
lysts back, including tailback William Peter- 
son, who led the team in rushing (901 yards) 
and caught 11 passes for 137 yards. The re- 
ceiving corps features Bill Franks and Paul 
Saunders. Place-kicker John Bianchi, who 
booted a school-record 16 field goals a year 
ago, also returns. Dayton's defense will center 
on its secondary: cornerbacks Bruce Moxley 
and Dan Rosenbaum and safeties Brett Cuth- 
bert and Randy Weisenseel. 


_ Stanley Drayton’ 
Allegheny 


Despite the loss of 10 starters, Lycoming 
(12-1) has a solid nucleus on both sides of the 
ball. Quarterback Ed Dougherty returns for his 
fourth year as a starter. He completed 56 per- 
cent of his passes for 2,706 yards and 22 
touchdowns and eamed Middle Atlantic Con- 
ference Player of the Year honors. In his ca- 
teer, Dougherty has thrown for 6,208 yards 
and 62 TDs. He will take snaps from senior 
Darrin Kenney, while Tim Kinney, Mike Clark, 
Jim Hepler, Tom Ott, and Dean Tomanio will 
see time on the offensive line. All-America 
linebacker Bill Small, the team's leading tack- 
ler, anchors a unit that was fourth in total de- 
fense a year ago. 

Lycoming’s chief concern in the MAC 
should be Juntata (7-2-1). Coach Brad 
Small’s Indians were the only team in the na- 
tion to face finalists Allegheny (a 30-30 tie) 
and Lycoming (a 31-0 loss) in 1990. Smalls 
main concern is to replace three players: run- 
ning back Dennis DeRenzo, split end Ray 
Shelley, and flanker Bob Dagen, who com- 
bined for 3,125 all-purpose yards and 28 
touchdowns. Quarterback Jason Miller again 
will run the offense. He threw for 1,936 yards 
and 14 TDs. Fullback Bili Posavek and tight 
end Matt Fulham also are offensive threats. 

Widener (7-2-1) could ‘challenge in the 
MAC, but it has numerous holes to fill. The key 
returning player is slotback-quarterback Josh 
Phelan, who caught 27 passes for 377 yards 


ay and completed 20 of 38 for 225 yards. Phelan 


G 


also returned 12 punts for 141 yards. Wideout 
Steve Hayko had 21 receptions for 175 yards. 
Brian Giachelti, a two-year starter at corner- 
back, keys the defense. He picked off 11 
passes and made 100 tackles. 

Coach John Luckhardt has reason to be 
optimistic about Washington & Jefferson. 
The Presidents, coming off their fifth consecu- 
tive Presidents Athletic Conference title, will 
miss just two starters on offense this fall. Lead- 
ing the offensive charge will be quarterback 
Bob Strope, who passed for 1,759 yards and 
14 TDs, and fleet tailback Chris Babirad, who 
rushed for 843 yards and nine scores. Split 
end Jeff Johnson hauled in 30 passes for 428 
yards and three TDs. Defensively, the Presi- 
dents will count on George Kidwell, Gilbert 
Floyd, and John Engeimohr. Kidwell is a men- 
acing linebacker with good speed, Floyd a 
three-year starter at defensive back who 
could break the W&J record for career inter- 
ceptions, and Engelmohr a lineman who was 
second on the team in tackles last season. 

“t think we have a chance to be very good 
again,” Luckhardt said. “We have two key 
players back at quarterback and tailback and 
two starting wide receivers. Even though we 
lose six good defensive players, the five re- 
turnees are all-conference players.” 

Carnegie Mellon (10-1) will find out early if it 
willbe as good as it was last season, since itis 
host to defending champion Allegheny in the 
season apener. But coach Rich Lackner has 
11 starters back from a team that won the 
inaugural University Athletic Association 
championship and posted the school’s 16th 
consecutive winning season. Halfbacks Greg 
Marmol and Andrew Pizzurro will be joined in 
the wing-T offense by quarterback Sam Man- 
gano and fullback Griffin Pero. The fleet Man- 
gano, who played primarily as a reserve the 
past two seasons, rushed for 364 yards and 
three touchdowns in 1990. He also averaged 
9.1 yards per carry. The offensive line is an- 
chored by Charles Jackson and Richard Wil- 
son. Inside linebacker Mike Hession and out- 
side linebacker Matt Pielert return to a stingy 
defense. The secondary is led by strong safe- 
ty John Fratto and cornerback Jeff Palaima. 

Veteran coach Hank Norton welcomes 
back 14 starters at Ferrum (8-2), which led the 
nation in rushing (434.7 yards) and scoring 
offense (47.3 points). While Norton must re- 
place most of his offensive line, he has numer- 
ous skill players back, including quarterback 
Rayna Williams, fullback Kirt Sturdevant, and 
tailback Linwood Jones. Williams rushed for 
614 yards and 12 TDs and threw for four more 
scores. Sturdevant ran for 668 yards and 
eight TDs and Jones added 465 yards and 
seven TDs. Linebackers Cecil Phillips and Ri- 
chie Marsh and ends Reed Newton and Greg 
Campbell anchor the defense. 

Frostburg State (9-2) returns a strong of- 
fense that could lift the Bobcats to a playoff 
berth. FSU again will look to its running game, 
led by Rory McTigue, the ECAC Division Ill 
South Player of the Year, who rushed for 914 
yards and a school-record 19 touchdowns 
last season. Halfback J.R. Bosley and quar- 
terback Mike Jones also are back. Jones will 
be looking for tight end Bill Seymour and split 
end Warren Tweedy. Graduation took a heavi- 
er toll on the defense, but linebackers Keith 
Keirzhowski and Jeremy Simmons return, as 
does cornerback Ricky Green. 


154 


Emory & Henry (6-4) is in search of a quar- 
terback to replace Pat Walker (1.986 yards 
passing, 20 TDs) but returns fullback Billy Al- 
len (410 yards, 4 TDs) to spark the offense. 
Talented running back Eric Buchanan retums 
after a year’s absence. 

Defense will be the key for perennial power 
Augustana (8-2) this season. Leading the way 
will be All-America senior cornerback Mike 
Hesler, who has intercepted 17 passes in his 
career. At the other corner is Karl Youngaquist. 
who blocked three field goals and two extra 
points last fall. Free safety Dave Edlund is the 
team’s leading tackler. The line is anchored 
by tackle Jack Skole and ends Matt Heinze 
and Recardo Brooks. George Annang holds 
down the middie-guard spot. James Fambro 
(625 yards, 8 TDs) led Augustana in rushing 
last season. He will be joined by fullback Brian 
Dunlavy (279 yards). Brian Pottinger, who 
missed the 1990 season with a teg injury, 
should be back at quarterback. Junior Marc 
Rosello will be the backup. 

“We expect a very good year,” said coach 
Bob Reade. who has a 117-15-1 record in 13 
seasons at Augustana. “! think that defensive- 
ly we will be very solid and on offense it will 
just be a matter of time before things jell.” 

Mount Union (10-1) has 42 lettermen back 
from last year’s team that finished with its third 
perfect regular-season record in the past six 
years. The Purple Raiders were beaten by Al- 
legheny in the first round of the playoffs. De- 
spite a number of key losses. including the 
graduation of All-America linebacker Dave 
Lasecki and place-kicker Ken Edelman and 
quarterback Brad Petro, Mount Union should 
be a contender again. Sophomore transfer 
Jim Ballard is expected to take over for Petro. 
Ballard will took to team up with wide receiver 
Ed Bubonics. a big-play threat who caught a 
team-record 12 TD passes last season. Soph- 
omore Grandville Weems averaged 5.9 yards 
per carry. Offensive guards Clint Lashley, 
Scott Lee, and Chuck Froehlich lead a strong 
line. Defensively, Mount Union returns tackle 
Mike Hallet, cornerback Brad Barringer, and 
linebacker Jeff Bartolet. 

Seven of 11 starters return on defense for 
Ithaca (8-2), but look for the offense, which 
has five starters back, to steal the show. Quar- 
terback Todd Wilkowski, who set five school 
passing records in 1990, leads the attack, 
complemented by fullback Jeff Wittman. Wil- 
kowski threw for 1.228 yards and 10 touch- 
downs and Wittman led all Division III rushers 
with 134.3 yards per game. He also scored 
16 touchdowns. Flanker Nick Ismailoff caught 
21 passes for 247 yards and two TDs. Line- 
backer Mark Phalen and Billie Mays are the 
defensive leaders. 

Cortland State (9-2), under second-year 
coach Dave Murray, is seeking its fourth con- 
secutive playoff berth. A solid defensive unit 
that registered three shutouts in 1990 returns 
intact and is led by linebacker Vinny Swanda. 
who had 70 tackles and 12 sacks. Free safety 
J.J. Graham is the leader in the secondary. 
The offense, which averaged a school-record 
448.1 yards per game, will be guided by quar- 
terback Dick Puccio. He will be working 
behind a veteran line. Senior Scott Berent 
gained 1,181 yards and scored 12 touch- 
downs in his first varsity year last fall. Speedy 
wideout Matt Shell, who had 42 catches for 
486 yards and five TDs, is also a dangerous 
kickoff-return specialist. 


Coach Jim Miceli has guided Ramapo (10- 
1) to a 24-5 record in his first three years, and 
with 14 starters back, the Roadrunners should 
be favored in the New Jersey Athletic Confer- 
ence. Although the defense lost to graduation 
brothers Jimmy and Maurice Williams, who 
combined for more than 200 tackles, the en- 
tire front four returns, led by ends Kimble 
Wright and Warren Morrell. Quarterback 
James Grant, the conference offensive player 
of the year, returns. He is the school's career 
rushing leader (1.614 yards). Tailback Glinton 
Spann (871 yards) is another threat. 

Shad Flynn last fall became the first fresh- 
man ever to start at quarterback for coach 
Ron Schipper at Central College (10-2), which 
is favored to win its eighth lowa Conference 
tile in nine years. Flynn passed for 1.067 


yards and six touchdowns in his debut sea- 
son. He'll be looking for wingback-punter Rich 
Schulte (28 receptions. 500 yards. five TDs). 
Two-time all-conference fullback Rich Kac- 
marynski, who rushed for 823 yards and 12 
TOs on 170 carries, also will spark the offense. 
Big things are expected on defense from all- 
conference end Tim Lewis, who had 91 tack- 
les and 12 sacks. Bill Mulder (116 tackles) is a 
key from his linebacker position. Schipper's 
biggest worries are on the offensive line and in 
the secondary. Schipper has led the Flying 
Dutchmen through 30 consecutive winning 
seasons. They have earned seven consecu- 
tive playoff spots and have won the West Re- 
gion five times in the past seven years. 

Occidental (6-3) is poised to recapture the 
Southern California Conference title after a 
year's absence and has the potential to devel- 
Op into a contender in the West Region. The 
Tigers have two capable quarterbacks in 
sophomore Derrick Williams and senior Scott 
Thompson, who will get the ball to David 
Grossklaus. perhaps Division III's finest tight 
end. Running back Brian Madlangbayan (750 
yards) also is a threat. Linebackers Robern 
Lewis and Jason Ramsey, nose guard Kelly 
Bynum, and safeties Rick Mock and Andrew 
Wind are the defensive leaders. 

Travis Palton, a speedy All-America tail- 
back who rushed for 1,072 yards two seasons 
ago but was forced to sit out most of last year 
with a ligament injury in his knee, will be back 
in the lineup for Wiseonsin-Whitewater (10- 
1). Palton will jon 15 retuming starters, includ- 
ing Dennis Bogacz. who passed for 1.996 
yards and 17 TDs. Dd

Hagan’s injury is similar to the one that 
eroded Oklahoma quarterback Jamelle Ho- 
lieway’s skills in 1988. If Hagan has the same 
experience or elects to redshirt, Colorado fig- 
ures to finish third. If Hagan returns to form, 
the Buffs will contend for a third straight title. 
Their defense is strong and features the Big 
Eight's best lineman, nose guard Joel Steed. 

If Joseph regains his form, Nebraska might 
prevail, despite its defense. The Cornhuskers 
have the Big Ejight’s most talented offense 
and most gifted offensive player in tight end 
Johnny Mitchell. 

Because it has a healthy and talented quar- 
terback in Cale Gundy and the Big Eight's 
best linebackers in Joe Bowden and Chris 
Wilson, Oklahoma is given a slight edge. But 
the Sooners, off probation and eligible for their 
first bowl in three years, do not have the blue- 
ribbon running backs and linemen who gave 
them the stamp of superiority in their champi- 
onship years, the fast of which was 1987. 

The gap between these top three teams 
and the remainder of the conference looks as 
spacious as last year, when Oklahoma and 
Nebraska tied for second with 5-2 records 
and no other team won more than two games. 
The bottom five teams figure to be closely 
bunched again. Kansas might have an edge 
in a race that will be as much to avoid eighth 
place as it will be to finish fourth. The Jay- 
hawks have an experienced lineup. lowa 
State depends on new runners and receivers.

Oklahoma State's only hope for offensive 
speed rests with a freshman tailback and juco 
receivers who won't enroll until August. Mis- 
souri has suspect runners and defenders. 

Gary Gibbs thinks this is Oklahoma's best 
team in his three years as head coach. A soft 
nonconference schedule will allow Oklaho- 
ma's linemen to develop. But the Sooners’ 
make-or-break time comes in mid-October 
when they play Colorado the week after meet- 
ing Texas. Noting the parity, Gibbs said, “The 
championship will probably come down to 
who has the fewest injuries. | am not sure any- 
one is deep enough to overcome injuries to 
key players.” 

One reason the Big Eight does not have 
representative strength is a glaring shortage 
of all-star running backs. Nebraska's Derek 
Brown and Oklahoma’s Earnest Williams 
might become stars but the conference that in

the last decade featured Barry Sanders, Billy 
Sims, Mike Rozier, Thurman Thomas, and 
Roger Craig kicks off 1991 without a back who 
is a qualified candidate for all-conference 
honors. This is not an indication of changing 
priorities. The backs who were supposed to 
pick up the torch are there but shackled in 
misfortune. Missouri's Tony VanZant tore up a 
knee before he ever played a down and dis- 
appeared from the depth chart in spring prac- 
tice, then was charged with assault in a bar- 
room brawl and suspended. Mike Gaddis of 
Oklahoma evoked Heisman talk two years ago 
before being felled by a knee injury. He has not 
played since and is not in Oklahoma's plans this 
year. The same is true of Rod Fisher, rated 
higher by Oklahoma coaches than Gaddis 
when they were recruited in the same class. 
Leodis Flowers of Nebraska appeared to be on 
track to reach expectations last year, but he fost 
his starting job, dropped to fourth team in the 
spring, and went AWOL for four days.

The experiences of these four running 
backs and the injuries to Hagan and Joseph 
diluted the Big Eight pool of offensive stars. 
Nebraska's Mitchell and center Jay Leeuwen-

OKLAHOMA 
(8-3, 5-2) The Sooners will tie their hopes of 
improvement and of their first Orange Bowl 
trip in four years to a defense that is essential- 
ly unchanged in makeup from last year, when 
it could not hold fourth-quarter leads. Texas 
and lowa State overcame Oklahoma with last- 
minute scoring drives to win one and two- 
point decisions, respectively. Colorado rallied 
in the second half to win by nine points. 
Coach Gary Gibbs is counting on a change 
in schemes, with an emphasis on an improved 
pass rush and more blitzing, and experience 
to plug the defensive leaks. He has the Big 
Eight’s best linebacking duo and impressive 
talent at all of the standup positions. But the 
interior line, vulnerable against the top rushing 


teams the last two years, does not have domi- 
nating personnel. 

Linebackers Joe Bowden and Chris Wilson 
and end Reggie Barnes are probably the Big 
Eight’s best players at their positions. If Au- 
brey Beavers becomes eligible, as anticipat- 
ed, another all-star possibility will be at the 
end opposite Barnes. The secondary has 
standouts in strong safety Jason Belser and © 
cornerback Darnell Walker. Free safety Terry 
Ray and cornerback Charles Franks are solid 
seniors. Gibbs concedes that tackle Stacey 
Dillard, a two-year starter who failed to reach 
expectations, nose guard Corey Mayfield, a 
converted end who became an emergency 
starter late last season, and tackle Russell Al- 
len, a promising sophomore, “are not great 
players but | think they can make us better. 
there than we were fast year." Tackle Proctor 
Land, a two-year backup, is scheduled to 
share time with Dillard. 

Offensively, the Sooners surround quarter- 
back Cale Gundy with an inexperienced tine 
and skill-position players who are short on 
dazzle. Sophomore Earnest Williams has the 
speed OU needs at tailback, where Dewell 
Brewer was the rushing leader last year (872 
yards). Mike Gaddis, an All-America hope be- 
fore suffering a knee injury in 1989, will return 
after sitting out last year but Gibbs doubis that 
he will be a factor. Alternating fullbacks Ken- 
yon Rasheed and Mike McKinley combined 
for 1,195 yards last year as plodders. 


Gundy, a gifted passer, will have better re- 
ceivers than a year ago. But as a group, wing- 
back Ted Leng, wideouts Greg Ervin, Corey 
Warren, and Tink Collins, and tight ends Joey 
Mickey and Rickey Brady lack consistency. 
Center Randy Wallace and tackle Brandon 
Houston are the only seasoned linemen. The 
Starting guards might be senior walk-on Chris 
Jensen, and junior-college transfer Paul Mor- 
iarty. The other tackle is apt to be Brian Braun- 
inger, who is injury-prone. 

Brad Reddell was the Big Eight’s No. 2 
punter (41.5) last year and will have to add the 
place-kicking duties if incoming freshman 
Scott Blanton is not adequate.
