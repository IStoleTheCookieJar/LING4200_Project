March 16th Brush Pile Burn 


otic To Start Forest Fire 


‘The May 8th forest fire started from a brush and dirt pile that 
had been burned seven and a half weeks earlier, according to 
DNR investigators. 

No charges were sought against the owner of the brush pile, 
Gerald Fagan, 57, of Thendara Rd., because of the “incredibly 
bizarre sct of circumstances” said Crawford County Prosecu- 
tor John Huss. 

Fagan had burned the brush pile on March 16 with a DNR 
permit while there was one inch of snow on the ground. The 
brush pile had apparently burned out within the week and 
Fagan had checked the pile periodically after that and found no 
fire left, 

Even though it snowed and rained after that date, some of the 
coals remained beneath the dirt and ashes and were re-ignited 
by the strong winds nearly seven weeks later on May 8th. DNR 
investigators believe the forest fire orginated from this brush 
pile, 

Here is the entire opinion issued by the Prosecuting Attor- 
ney: 


The forest fire of May 8, 1990, which commenced at ap- 
proximately 3:30 o’clock p.m. near Thendara Road in Gray- 
ling Township, Crawford County, Michigan and eventually 
involved over five thousand, four hundred acres of land, the 
destruction of eighty-one domiciles, one hundred, thirteen 
outbuildings and twenty-five motor vehicles, boats and all 
terrain vehicles was caused by an incredibly bizarre set of 
circumstances which are detailed as follows and leads me to 
conclude that there was no criminal violation of P.A. 1969, No. 
329, being the Prevention And Suppression of Forest Fires Act 
as found at MCLA 320.21 ct. seq. 

On May 17, 1990, the Michigan Department of Natural 
Resources, Law Enforcement Division, presented my office 
with a report prepared by CO Bruce Patrick, requesting a 
warrant for Gerald Landon Fagan of Thendara Road, Grayling, 
Michigan, charging him with a violation of MCLA 320.25 (b) 
which provides “a person shall not... set fire, or cause, or 
procure the setting on fire of any flammable material on or 
adjacent to Forest Land without taking reasonable precautions, 
both before and after lighting the fire, and atall times thercafter 
to prevent escape thereof or leave the fire before it is extin- 
guished.” 

The 21 page report establishes the following facts: 

1. Inearly March, 1990, the suspect hired a commercial 
excavator lo bulldoze stumps, trees and slash into four separate 


piles on his property located ina line and easterly of his home 
as a resull of his efforts to clear his property. 

2. The suspect sought and was granted a burning permit 
from the Department of Natural Resources on March 16, 1990, 
and burned both the first brush pile or the one nearest his hare 
and the second brush pile on that day, there being approxi- 
mately one inch of snow on the ground at that time. 

3. It has been established that the suspect had no intention 
of burning the third and fourth brush piles, being further East 
of his home, and had evidenced this intention to neighbors 
stating that he was going to leave them there for rabbit and 
other small game cover. 

4. That the first brush pile burned and then sinoldered for

approximately two weeks and the second brush pile immedi

5. Visual inspection of the land showed that bulldozer

several large oak trees, the property appeared to have been 
stripped of all brush and slash. 

6. On April 16, 1990, the #1 brush pile, or the brush pile 
nearest the suspect’s home, rekindled itself and the suspect

City Police, Ronald McDonald 


Join Forces to 


Grayling children caught up in traumatic situations will soon 
be comforted by Patrolman Ronald McDonald of the Grayling 
City Police Department, 

The Patrolman Ronald McDonald Program is a pilot pro- 
gram, sponsored by Grayling’s McDonald’s Restaurant, that 
puts Ronald McDonald dolls in Grayling City Police patro! 
Cars. 

Ronald McDonald dolls are being used by city patrolmen to 
comfort and distract children involved in automobile acci- 
dents, domestic disputes, child abuse and other circumstances 
where children are hurt or frightened. The program is similar 
to the Michigan State Police’s Teddy Bear Program. 

Grayling Chief of Police Peter Stephan said Ronald 
McDonald will officially become an honorary city patrolman 
at a swearing-in ceremony at city hat! on June 1 Ith. 

Patrolman Dennis Long, the idea man for the program, said 
the doils will be uscd as a tool by officers to focus the attention 
of a child off the immediate circumstances onto something 
more pleasurable. Hopefully the program will also help to 
establish a positive impression in what could be the child’s first 
encounter with a police officer. 

“First impressions always play an important part in future 
dealings with people,” said Long, “‘and first impressions with 
children are probably one of the most important impressions 
we are concerned with,” he continued. “How to have a 
favorable first impression has always been a problem: with po- 
lice.” Long said many police officers purchase candy with 
their own money and carry it to help them make a favorable 
first impression. 

Parents can sometimes create fear of police officers in their 
children, without meaning to, said Long, by telling them that 
if they don’t behave, or eat all their vegetables that the police 
are going to come and take them away. 

““Don’tever tell your children that!” said Long emphatically. 
“He may be missing someday and I will be looking for him in 
the woods for hours, and he won’t come out because he 
remembers ‘He's going to take you away!” , 

As the different community agencics learn about the pro- 
gram Stephan said they will probably be able to suggest other 
uses for the dolls. An example would be nurses at the hospital 
caring for a battered child and Children’s Protective Services 
facing removal of a child from his home. 

Long said budget constraints, common for every police 
agency, has rnade these type programs impossible for most 
departments. 

“We are very fortunate the Grayling McDonald’s was inter- 
ested in our cause,” said Long. ““McDonald’s has spent billions 
of dollars creating a positive image and I think it is great that 
they have agreed to lend that positive image to our police 
department by supplying the Ronald McDonald dolls for our 
program.” 

“When Denny approached me with the idea,” said Philip 
Weiler, general manager for McDonald’s, “my first thought 
was ‘Why hasn’t someone thought of this earlier?’” 

A survey conducted by McDonald’s found that Ronald 
McDonald is the second most recognizable character among

Help Children 


WORKING TOGETHER--The Patrolman 
Ronald McDonald Program brings the Grayling

Police Dept., Patrolman Dennis Long, together to 
help relieve anxiety in children caught in traumatic 
situations. 


children, the first being SantaClaus. Weiler said the Patrolman 
Ronald McDonald Program will be using the positive influ- 
ence associated with Ronald McDonald for the benefit of 
Grayling’s children. 

“It’s our police department and ourcommunity,” said Weiler, 
“and this program is a way we can give something back. The 
cost of the program is a less important issue than the ability for 
us to join forces,” 

Stephan, Long and Weiler said they are not only enthusiastic 
about the local Patrolman Ronald McDonald Program, but 
they can sce many other uses of Ronald McDonald’s positive 
image to benefit children. 

“Ronald McDonald could be taken to schools to talk to 
children about drug abuse or fire escape routes,” said Weiler. 

“What better way to break the ice with a bunch of third 
graders than to have Ronald McDonald there with you?” asked 
Long. “They know us as Joe Cop, but they didn’t know we 
were friends with the second most recognized person in the 
nation.” 

Stephan said he would be presenting an explanation of the 
program at the upcoming police chief’s convention and Weiler 
is taking the idea to the McDonald’s convention. They said 
hopefully other communitics will hear about the Patrolman 
Ronald McDonald Program and adopt it for their children.

Landowners Faced With Tough 
Choices About Burned Timber 


Experts in the field of forest management met with Crawford 
County landowners last Friday at the courthouse to suggest 
ways of salvaging their burned timber and reforest their prop- 
erties. 

Foresters Jim McMillan, from the DNR, and Jim Wad- 
sworth, from Weyerhaeuser, Barb Stauffer, from the U. S. Soil 
Conservation Service (SCS) and the Agricultural Stabilization 
Conservation Service (ASCS), and Roy Spangler, from the 
Cooperative Extension Services explained to landowners 
several options available to them regarding their timber sal- 
vage efforts. 


Wadsworth told the group the Weyerhacuser Structurwood 
Plant was going to try to increase its consumption of jack pine 
from 25 percent to 30 or 40 percent in an effort to offer an 
increased market for Crawford County landowners who lost 
their forests in May 8th’s devastating fire. 

Weyerhaeuser is also offering the services of their foresters, 
Wadsworth and Mike Castle, as consultants to fire victims to 
help them make important decisions such as when to harvest, 
whether to harvest, what markets are available to them and 
finally what to do with the land. Landowners will also have to 
decide whether they want to let the forest reforest itself natu- 
rally with jack pines, or choose to plant other types of trees. 

General manager of the Grayling Weyerhaeuser plantRodger 
Anger said the effort on their part was in no way intended to be 
opportunistic, but rather to offer their assistance in the 
community’s resource recovery process. 


McMillan told landowners the trees killed by the intense heat 
and fire on their property could still be valuable for pulp and 
saw logs if they act within the next 60 to 90 days to have it 
harvested, After that time, McMillan said bark beetles will 
begin destroying what is left of the wood. . 

Property owners with three acres or more appear to have a 
better chance of selting their timber to logging companies than 
small lot owners, said McMillan. 

“The person with two acres or less will probably have to 
clear their land themselves,” he said. “The more acreage a 
person has the more likely they are to be able to sell it 
commercially”, 

McMillan said small lot owners can either cut the timber for 
their own wood use or they can try to market it locally for fuel 
wood. Persons with more property will probably be able to 
market the “smaller stuff” (less than ten inches in diameter) for

Midland, Lincoln and Hillman. 

According to McMillan, there is a good market for saw logs 
ten inches or more in diameter. He advised persons with 
marketable saw logs to contact the DNR Field Office for 
suggestions regarding ways to sell the timber. 

Not all the trees in the bumed area were killed. Spangler 
cautioned persons thinking about having the trees on their 
property cut to have a forester examine the trees to determine 
which trees are dead and which are not. 

It sounds incredible, but Mc Millan said not all the trees in the 
burned area are dead. If the top half of the tree is still green, he 
said landowners should monitor it before cutting it down, He 
said there is a good chance those trees will survive the fire. 

Trees that are all brown or black, with needles that are bent 
and curled, are most likely dead and should be harvested as 
soon as possible. 


The SCS conservationist and forester are also available to all 
victims of the fire to assist them in the re-establishment of 
vegetation. 

Stauffer told the group that she was not sure, at this time, 
what help is going to be available for reforestation and stream- 
bank erosion projects. 

Those property owners who have previously registered their 
land as agricultural, forestry producing, or wildlife lands with 
the SCS are eligible for the SCS cost share programs. These 
programs make available grass seed mixtures, trees for refor- 
estation, and wildlife vegetation. Those who are not registered 
should contact the Roscommon SCS office to inquire of avail- 
able programs and to sign up for the fall seedling program. 

The spring seedling program is over, but Stauffer said 
persons intending to replant their burned acreage should reg- 
ister with the SCS for fall and spring 1991 seedlings, This fall 
ted and white pine, douglas fur, and blue, white and norway 
spruce trees will be available for a nominal fee. 

“We are a unit of goverment and not out to make a profit,” 
said Stauffer. “Our fees are set to cover our costs for the two- 


year seedlings.” 


inthe spring, besides the pine trees, the SCS will have shrubs 
such as honeysuckle, Autumn Olive, Red Osier Dogwood, 
Mountain Ash and Russian Olive. Small wildlife omamental 
trees such as Washington Hawthom, White Birch and Hybrid 
Poplar will also be available. 


Stauffer suggested that property owners consult with a 
forester before any planting is started, She said they can advise 
on what types of trees are best suited for this area. To prevent 
streambank erosion, Stauffer suggested cedar posts, rock np 
rap, and streambank shrubs. Before any river restoration is 
started, she said owners of river frontage should consult with 
the DNR to see what is allowed under the recently approved 
Natural Rivers Act. 

Landowners with questions regarding the harvesting of their 
bumed forests or reforestation of the land are urged to contact 
the DNR, the Weyerhaeuser Structurwood Plant, and the Soil 
Conservation Service office in Roscommon. 

‘Nobody wants these landowners to be taken advantage of,” 
said Stauffer. “They have lost enough already.”

Kindness Will 
Never Be Forgotten 


To the Editor: 

Following the fire on May 8 
I returned to my home. 
Though | lost my garage and 
sustained some damage to the 
rear of my home, the house 
and its contents were saved. 

While inspecting the house, 
two young men drove up and 
introduced themselves as fire- 
fighters from Frederic. As 
they were driving past my 
home, the day of the fire, they 
glimpsed an orange light in 
the garage, which turned out 


10 be a blaze at the rear. Iam 
sorry that I did not get the 
names of the gentlemen who 
surely saved my home. 

To them and to all of the 
wonderful people who have 
shown so much courage, care, 
and concern, I want to give 
my thanks. 

The kindness shown to me 
by everyone involved since 
the fire will never be forgot-

Thank You 
National Guards 


To the Editor: 

I am a proud resident of 
Grayling and have been for 50 
years, In all that time I have 
seen old business go and new 
come in. I have lived most of 
the 50 years at Lake Margre- 
the, only a couple of miles 
from the Nattonal Guard 
Camp. In all those years I 
have never been bothered by 
the noise or the Guards them- 
selves personally. In fact, I 


for one am glad they are here. 
When we hear the “noise” we 
should feel secure in knowing 
we have them here to protect 
us in case they are needed. 
They have come through for 
Grayling many times - - one 
example is the recent fire. 

I for one would like to sa- 
lute the National Guard here 
in Grayling.

Crawford County Is Filled 
With Wonderful, Caring People 


Dear Jon, 

I have never written a fetter 
toan Editor before, but I think 
the events of the past few days 
warrant it. 

I want to thank everyone 
who had anything to do with 
fighting the fire and furnish- 


ing aid and comfort to the | 


fighters and evacuces alike. 

To our dear Lord, His holy 
Mother, His Angels, and His 
Saints for mercifully sparing 
the lives of all the people in- 
volved and for sparing the 
homes He did, ours included. 
For the saving and healing 
rain ihat got here jusi in the 
nick of time, We are not 
worthy. Thank you. 

We had dear friends and 
neighbors who lost everything

from him. Mr. Gates was 
quoted as saying it was an act 
of God that kept his lodge 
from burning. Knowing his 
attitude toward the Guard and 
how the majority of people 
feel toward him, I would say it 
was an act of God that you 
buried your personal feelings 
and kept spraying. Well done 
Gentlemen.

Walkers 


Raise $4,300 


To the Editor: 

On behalf of the Northeast- 
em Chapter of the March of 
Dimes, we would like tothank 
all of the walkers and volun- 
teers who participated in Walk 
America 1990, for the Gray- 
ling area, on Saturday, May 
12. Over $4,300.00 was raised 
to help the March of Dimes 
prevent birth defects, the 
nation’s number one child 
health probiem, 


Awards were presented to: 
Mercy Hospital for the most 
donations raised by a team 
$1,181.00; Grayling State 
Bank for the most team walk- 
ers - 23 walkers; Janet San- 
cartier of Grayling, for the 
most donations raised by one 
person, $1,060.00; Marvin 
Wikoff was the oldest walker 


- 69 years old; and Lindsay 
Niebrzydowski was the 
youngest walker - 3 years old. 

Credit for the success of 
Walk America belongs cn- 
tirely to the people of Gray- 
ling. Individuals, business, 
clubs, and schools all rallied 
together to improve the health 
of future generations. We are 
especially indebted to the more 
than 70 walkers who partici- 
pated. 

The moncy raised will go to 
support March of Dimes pro- 
grams to prevent birth defects 
nationally and in Northeast- 
em Michigan. 

Thank you, Grayling, for 
your commitment to giving 
every child a healthy start in 
life, 

Patrick Skiba 
Division Director

Heartwarming To See How 
Community Joined Together 


Dear Editor, 

My sympathy goes oul to 
those residents who lost their 
homes and property in the 
devastating fire which swept 
through the AuSable River 
Valley this last weck. We 
shouid all be grateful that lives 
were not lost. It is extremely 
heartwarming to see how the 
community joined together to 
give its time, resources, and 
especially themselves during 
this crisis. 


So Many 
Care 


A big thank you from the 
families of Pappy’s Trail to 
everyone who worked so hard 
tosave ourhomes. Also to the 
policeman who helped evacu- 
ate, 

Also to Borchers Canoc 
rental who let us camp out and 
enjoy a home cooked break- 
fast. 

The nightmare of this will 
always stay with us but the 
comfort of knowing there are 
so many people who care is a 
big help. 


Grant and Chery] 
Alandt 


Ihave becn spending much 
of my time in the Grayling 
area for the last 17 years, 
Needless to say, I feel as 
though I am a part of that 
community. The concer for 
preservation of nature and the 
environment and quality of 
life is shared by all. ‘This is 
evident in how quickly the 
DNR, the American Red 
Cross, the National Guard, 
local businesses and con- 
cemed individuals reacted to 
relieve the suffering and prop- 
erty loss of their neighbors. 

With so much of my time 
spent in Grayling, it's becn 
hard to avoid the conflict be- 
tween AMAC, the Anglers, 
the AuSable Conservation 
Trust and the National Guard. 
But when the chips were 
down, whocame through? Of 
all these groups, the only or- 
ganized effort I saw was the 
National Guard -—— housing 
and feeding evacuecs and 
lending a hand wherever 
needed. 

If l had to “choose sides” in 
this debate, [ don’t think it 
would surprise anyone if I 
went for the Grayling Com- 
munity and the National 
Guard. As far as } car tell, 
they are one and the saine, 

Bob Sauvage 
Bay City 


to sustain him in his journey. We have no such niceties 


Tuesday, May 8, 1990. 

Now w tell Dave. At six o’clock, the two of us had 
been sitting in Taste of Traverse eating an early dinner of 
vegetable iasagna and frozen lemon yogurt. In the short 
span of one and one half hours since then, I have been to 


to send with Missy and Murphy, but I suspect that they 
will not be needing sustenance or toys. 

They take only their bells, which they wore in this 
world, so we could track them as they ran off on their 
various unapproved adventures. Dave says later that for 


the inferno and back. 


So now to tell Dave. But what and how to tell him? 
Tam not very good at dissembling, so I report the simple 


truth as I know it: 


a moment he wished he had kept the bells. But then, he 
adds, they would only have served as a reminder of the 
dogs and he does not need bells to remind him of Missy 
and Murphy. 


There has been a horrible forest fire. I saw the 
garage buming. Moments later I saw the house burning. 
I do not have the animals with me. 

His response is a wail: I can live without the house, 
but I can’t live without the animals. 

I don’t think they are alive, I tell him. I saw the 
house and 1 saw the garage, but I did not see them, 
Although I tried, I tell him. I heard the reports of fire as 
I drove toward Grayling, and I defied a roadblock to get 
home, and I tried hard to save them, but I don’t think . . 


I wait for an hour or more as he drives from Traverse 
City to Grayling alone, He tells me later that in the car, 
he called out the names of the pets. Jody. Missy. 
Murphy. Ally. Ifhis calling their names again and again 
could have saved them, they would be here with us today. 

Meanwhile darkness descends and a chill sets in 
and the tardy rain begins to fall. We meet somewhere 
along North Down River Road at nine o’clock and wait 
with all the others for some news. Whencan we return to 
our homes? Are there homes standing to which we can 
return? Rumors swirl and conflicting reports abound, 

I sce a small black dog with a woman, who is using 
a towel in place of a leash. The dog looks like Murphy. 
I shine my flashlight on him and the woman recoils as if 
she thinks I will take him from her. But] will not, because 
he is not my Murphy. 

That night we wait until eleven, then leave with 
friends. They will house us and nourish us in the next few 
hours and the next few days, as the magnitude of the 
disaster unfolds. 

We are surrounded by good people who comfort us 
until twelve, then until one, and finally, until two, when 
we stumble off to the bedroom. Dave and I talk until 
three, until four, until five. Perhaps we drift in and out 
of sicep for a few minutes between five and six, when we 
get up. We want to go home. 

When the officials finally let us back, we go first to 
the garage. Surely the kitten Ally died in the house, but 
maybe - MAYBE - the dogs escaped under the fence, 
They have done it before. We see a fresh hole and for a 
few moments we feel hope for the first time since the 
evening before. 

It is shortlived. Our friends find the remains of 
Murphy, then Missy. Dave is stoic, but now I wail. They 
look further for Jody, but cannot find her. I am distressed 
because I want her buried with her kennelmates. 

Dave and I are like parents who, though sickened 
by the messes of others, can easily and lovingly clean the 
vomit and the offal of their own children. We pick up the 
charred remains of our dogs and take them to be buricd 
next to Buddy. 

When we buried Buddy four years ago, we sent him 
to the afterworld with food and treats and balls and sticks 


We are miffed at Missy. She was the lead dog, and 
she has tricked us so many times in the past to sneak olf 
and into trouble. Why did she not usc her wiles to escape 
thistime? Perhaps she tried, Perhaps the space under the © 
fence was her futile attempt: 

We try to accept that our life with our pets is over. 
In the daygand months and years to come, we will grieve 
for: ; 

Jody, the mangy puppy that became the grand dame 
of our family, Our greying, arthritic 13-year-old black 
Lab/German short hair pointer was my birthday gift 
from Dave in 1977. In her prime, Jody was a combina- 
tion of mountain goat, Earth mother and Prom queen. A 
team player, she refused to be an only dog after Buddy 
died in 1986, so we got her... 

Missy, a lovely, spirited, athletic ycllow Lab cross 
that was about to be shot by an owner who could not 
tolerate her chasing the deer in his yard. Usually we 
called her“‘Mischief.” Other animals adored Missy, cven 
the neighbor cats and our own kitten. We took her 
through three terms of dog obedience classes, so that our 
friends and family might love her too. She was the best 
buddy of... 

Murphy, anetemally happy, wiggly mutt that looked 
like a miniature black Lab, Dave found him abandoncd 
under a mobile home in the winter of 1987 and brought 
‘himhome. Dave and Murphy were “the guys,” The two 
of them would regularly curl up on the couch for an 
evening of good reading. Occasionally he would do the 
same with me, He was a little frightened of . . , 

Ally, a wild yet gentle six-month-old grey kitten. 
We were just getting to know her, but already loved her. 
In bed Dave would fall asicep with his arm crooked to 
make a place for her when she was ready to settle down 
for the night, When he awoke near morning, she would 
be curled up against his arm, waiting to have her neck 
scratched and her tummy stroked. 

I find her little grey bones in the area that had been 
our kitchen. We bury them in onc of the many holes that 
Murphy had dug on the property in his constant quest to 
subdue the gopher and chipmunk traffic. 

And yes, we lost our home anéall of our belongings. 
I will deal with that loss later, but today it seems only a 
footnote to the four little lives that went with the fire, 

I remember this quotation by Sophia Loren, of all 
people, She said, “Never love anything that can’t love 
youback.” When I read it years ago, J thought it seemed 
wise counsel, I still do today, even as I recall the literally 
thousands of items that I erroneously believed made up 
my cxistence, 

Of course it was not the things. It was our family 
and our friends and our pets, Today I can only trust that 
to the end, those little creatures knew how beloved they 
were to us and how lonely we would be without them. 


Page 5 -- AVALANCHE -- Thursday, MAY 24, 1990 


Dear Sirs: 

This is a letter in thanks to the 
DNR and the people who were 
directly involved in fighting 
the fire. 

My wife's cottage and the 
homes of her relatives next to 
us were spared. Itis clear that 
the fire fighters stopped the 
fire from reaching one of our 
homes, for which we are all 
very thankful, especially since 
five cottages and homes near 


us were notas fortunate. Even 


though there was a great loss 
of property, it is clear that the 
fire fighters saved many 
homes by their direct efforts. 

Until we could get into the 
area to assess the damage it 
was a very stressful period. | 
would also like to say that all 
of the people that I came in 
contact with were very polite 
and sympathetic, This is par- 
ticularly true of the State Po- 
lice, Crawford County 
Sheriff’s Deputies, and the 
DNRofficers who manned the 
road blocks. I also found the 
public utility employees cour- 
teous and helpful, 

After the fire had swept 
through the area, property 
owners were kept out of the 
area much longer than was 


necessary. There were four 
reasons given at different 
times why the property own- 
ers were not allowed to enter 
the fire area: 1. Hotspots; 2. 
Downed power fines; 3. 
Looters in the arca; and the 
worst one of all 4. The Gov- 
ernor had not inspected the 
area yet, During the height of 
the fire all people must be 
kept out of the fire area to 
facilitate the fighting of the 
fire and preventconfusion, but 
1 do not believe that because 
the Govemor is going to in- 
spect the area he has more 
rights than the property own- 
ers whose property is directly 
involved. Allowing property 
owners access to their prop- 
erty would not have interfered 
with the Govemor's flightover 
the area. Properly owners 
gathered at the corner of 
Stephan Bridge Road and N. 
Down River Road were in- 
censed at this one. 

Once the immediate fire 
danger had passed, none of 
those reasons have any valid- 


corker. 

Just when all the Michigan political bigwigs and all the 
Michigan media punditry were set to wave goodbyc to 
her and trot out their phrases of praise for her long and 
illustrious career in state and national politics, Michigan's 
lieutenant governor looked innocent and asked: “Who, 
me?” 

No, she’s not ready to retire. She’s fit and raring to 
keep on trucking as lieutenant governor. 

Atage 78, Griffiths already has had at least fourcareers 
——as successful lawyer and judge, as respected member 
of Congress, as valued business consultant and corpora- 
tion director, and for the last eight years of the James 
Blanchard administration, as resident state capitol cur- 
mudgeon as lieutenant governor. 

Most folks would be perfectly content to have accom- 
plished even one-quarter of Mrs. Griffiths’ success. But 
she wants to keep going. 

* * 

OF COURSE, THIS is to counter to all the conven- 
tional political wisdom that has grown up lately. Mrs. 
Griffiths was supposed to be ready to retire gracefully. 
Gov. Blanchard was supposed to be ready to pick a new, 
young face to join him on the ticket this year — probably 
someone from Macomb County, where the once-solid 
Democratic electorate has been shifting more and more 
to the Republican column. 

Most media pundits already had anointed Macomb 
Prosecuter Car] Marlinga with the lieutenant governor's 
nomination this year. Some even went so far as to 
speculate what kind of a governor Mr. Marlinga will be, 
once he succeeds Mr. Blanchard down the road. 

But Mrs. Griffiths threw her own personal monkey 
wrench into all that speculation ... or was it real planning? 

Anyway, Martha Griffiths said she’s ready to run 
again... she wants the job... and Gov. Blanchard will have 
to tell her to get off the ticket before she'll go. 

Conventional political wisdom claims that’s exactly 
what Gov. Blanchard would like to do. Conventional 
wisdom also holds, however, that he won’t do it, because 
dumping Mrs. Griffiths would alienate such voter groups 
as seniors, women, and liberals, to list a few. 

* * = 

WHY DID MRS. GRIFFITHS decide to stick around? 
Probably nobody knows for sure, including Mrs. Grif- 
fiths. 

One conjecture is that Mrs. Griffiths really doesn’t 
intend to run again, despite her monkey wrench an- 
nouncement. Instead, so goes this view, she wants to hold 
her own candidacy over Mr. Bianchard’s head until he 
agrees to put another strong female candidate in the job 
instead. 

But why wouldn’t Mrs. Griffiths want to keep her job 
in the capitol? The pay’s pretty good... some $80,000 or 


so a year, 
* * * 


IF MARTHA GRIFFITHS is on the Blanchard ticket 
this fall, it certainly won’tharm the Blanchard campaign. 
Shcis still a strong candidate, beloved by many, hated by 
few. And she will be a strong campaigner herself, in a 
limited way and in selected spots. 

The most telling effect of another Griffiths election 
could well be that Michigan’s Democratic leadership, 
after-Blanchard, will be up for grabs. 

Jim Blanchard has been governor for eight years, one 
more term would make it 12, which isa pretty long career 
forany governor. The licutenant is the natural successor 
to run for governor, after-Blanchard. Mr, Marlinga, or 
another person of his age and background, would be a 
natural Blanchard successor. 

But if itis Martha Griffiths who is licutenant governor 
when Mr. Blanchard decides to pack it in... wel, that’s 
another story. 

Mrs. Griffiths, after all, will be 82 after another four 
year term. Certainly she would not run for governor after 
Mr. Blanchard leaves... or would she? 

Don’t bet against it,

ity over the rights of the prop- 
erty owners to inspect and 
protect their property, espe- 
cially those of permanent resi- 
dents. The permanent resi- 
denis should have been al- 
lowed in immediately even if 
there was some danger to 
themselves on showing proof 
of residency in the fire area, 
i.c. drivers license. Non-resi- 
dent property owners should 
be allowed in on furnishing 
proof of ownership, i.c. copy

official stationary issued by 
the township or county treas- 


urer stating that the person 
owns property in the fire area. 
By allowing property owners 
in, they could fight the hot 
Spots themselves, stop loot- 
ers, and direct linemen as 
necded. 


1 was allowed in some 16° 


hours after the fire had been 
brought under control and 
some 20 hours after the fire 
had passed by my home. There 
were still smoldering logs and 
stumps that I put out. I was 
able to save the phone and 
electric line men needless 
duplication of effort and time 


by telling them our wires were 
OK and that our neighbor's 
wire was not. Several electric 
and phone linemen came to 
inspect the lines and were able 
tocontinue on without having 
to check further. 


The biggest problem was 
with gawkers and sightseers, 
I can not believe the number 
of curiosity seekers who drove 
in just to see what had hap- 
pened, including two differ- 
ent instances where people 
with trucks drove in and when 
they saw my wife or me they 


left in a big hurry, 

Road blocks are necessary, 
especially to keep out people 
who have no legitimate rea- 
son to be there, but the prop- 
erty owners, especially per- 
manent residents, shouldhave 
been allowed in as soon as the 
imminent danger had passed 
and it was daylight. 

Thank you fire fighters on 
behalf of myself and my 
immediate neighbors. For 
those who were not so fortu- 
nate, my heartfelt sympathy.

A Hope For The Future 


Last week as I was tidying 
up before going to bed, I re- 
flected on our evening drive. 
Usually our drives are so re- 
laxing, and they help us set the 
pace for the weekend tocome. 
We have spent many of them 
along the lakeshore, rolling 
along the countryside, and 
watching the sunset, 

My boys had already gone 
to bed, and my husband was 
making his way to ours. We 
were all exhausted from the 
previous work week, I de- 
cided I couldn’t steep until I 
had some peace of mind. For 
you see this week, our drive 
took us along North Down 
River Road, Stephan Bridge 
Road, and Wakely Bridge 
Road. 

I remember Tuesday viv- 
idly, The sun was shining and 
it had the promise of being a 
beautiful spring day, with just 
a tastc of summer to come, | 
had high hopes fora renewing 
of my spirits. Things changed, 
asmy oldest son woke up with 
a high fever and vomiting. 
Halfway through the morning 
I was hanging on the clothes- 
line every blaukct, afghan, 
sheet, pillow covers, audeven 
the cushion cover from the 
couch, This is not what I had 


planned to do with my day. | 
was thankful for the strong 
winds that dried my washing 
so quickly. 

That same wind that I was 
so grateful for, was later to 
become acurse to others. That 
aftemoon the wind took a 
small flame and turned it into 
an inferno. The sirens blared 
non-stop for hours. By late 
afternoon, I was realizing this 
was more than just an ordi- 
nary fire. 

From my front porch, my 
workroom, [ watched as my 
neighbors loaded up all the 
children and friends and 
headed out vehicle by vehicle, 
to watch the fire. The smoke 
was high into the sky now and 
making its presence known to 
many. 

Evacuations of residents in 
the path of the fire were now 
intensifying. Roadblocks 
were set up to keep the curi- 
ous from coming into the dis- 
aster area. Then there were 
the looters. You know the 
rest. 

On Friday night, when all 
the areas were clear, we too 
went for a drive to see with 
our own eyes, the horrors the 
television screen had been 
revealing, Our drive revealed 


the parched, blackened for- 
ests, the foundation and chim- 
neys that were once a partofa 
home, People standing in 
small groups trying to com-

desolate, scorched, rubble they 
once called “home.” 

In anareaof 1/2 mile, where 
5 houses once made up a nice 
little neighborhood, two re-

Reader Says DNR Should Stop 
Leasing Land To Oil Companies 


Dear Mr. Thompson, 

I would like to say thatI am 
sorry to all the good folks that 
have lost their homes and 
everything in them and we all 
can be thankful that no one 
got hurt and no one lost their 
lives in the fire and I would 
like to thank each and every 
one that helped in anyway 
when we had this fire. We all 
became friends and helped 


cach other, T hope it will stay 
that way ~- just like Earth 
Day should be year round, not 
just for a day. 

I would like to ask the DNR 
officers in Lansing to stop 
leasing the land to the oil 
companies because all you are 
doing is helping to damage 
the environment and harm the 
wildlife. [do not know if you 
people are for the oil compa- 


Still Paying Price 
For Cutting White Pine 


Dear Jon: 

The tragic fire at Grayling 
reestablishes one of the laws 
of nature. When the balance 
of nature is upset or altered, a 
price must be paid. 

The price for the cutting 
down of the Amazonian rain 
forests will be paid for by our 
children and grandchildren by 
a gradual warming of the earth 
and its attendant disasters, 

The price paid for by South- 
em Californians who build 
their homes over and over 
again in the canyons and ar- 


royos that are dried by the 
Santa Ana winds, or cirocco, 
is the destruction of those 
homes when the inevitable 
fires begin. 

The price is still being paid 
for by us the for the massive 
cutting of the White Pine for- 
estsin Michigan. In yourarea, 
the immediate price was the 
siltation of the AuSable River 
and the loss of the Grayling 
trout. The successive price 
was the establishment of aJack 
Pine forest that is genetically 
determined to burn periodi- 


nics or if you are for a clean 
environment. If you are fora 
clean environment then donot 
lease the land to the oil com- 
panies; the fire did too much 
damage and we do not need 
the oil companies to do any 
more damage than they are 
doing now tothe environment.

cally so thatits pinecones can 
release their seeds. The 
immediate price is the loss of 
the homes of those whochoose 
to build there. 

My question is, unlike the 
Californians who build in tin- 
derbox canyons oron the sides 
of mountains that periodically 
have mud slides that take 
homes down with them, have 
we learned from this disaster 
not to build in the same or 
similar environment again?

neal About It 


By Joe Murphy 


ee 


I don’t know about you but when I was a kid you had 
to be in pretty bad shape to rate a trip to the doctor, Most 
things were treated with home remedies; some based on 
folklore, others on medical facts, A lot of them seemed 
todo the job as well as the miracle drugs of today. I read 
an article in the paper a while ago saying a team of doctors 
were researching and trying some of the old remedies and 
finding some were very effective. ! remember one of 
Mom’s treatments for cuts, etc., was a bread and milk 
poultice, the more mold on the bread the better. Later 
penicillin was developed from bread mold, we were 
being treated with penicillin before they knew what it 
was. My dad always said he hated to sec spring come 
when he was a boy for he was always given sulfur and 
molasses asa spring tonic. Mom saw toit we took our cod 
liver oil, maybe there are things that taste worse but nol 
very many. Goose grease served as a base for many 
different home remedies, Goose grease and camphor was 
achest rub forcolds. Goose grease and turpentine for bad 
chest colds and pneumonia. There were others that used 
goose grease as a base. Mom’s favorite cough syrup was 
made from onions and brown sugar; she always kept a 
cup on the back of the stove in the winter. As soon asa 
cough started we took it and I don’t recall having many 
bad colds as a child. Seems every family had their 
favorite cures for the sicknesses and minor injurics in 
those days. 

Some of the old timers swore by the old patent medi- 
cines that could cure any thing from hemorrhoids to heart 
trouble. Remember the Geritol craze of the fifties, it 
would cure anything that ailed you. Remember the joke 
about the old man saying that his wife was so nervous 
nobody could sleep with her, then she took Geritol and 
anybody could sleep with her.

Dear Editor: 

I am writing to say how 
very disappointed I am in the 
members of our community 
-— I was highly appalled atthe 
number of people who showed 
up at the seminar on recycling 
at the high school. I think itis 
very sad when only twelve 
members of our community 
are concerned with our envi- 
ronment, or rather, our grow- 
ing lack of environment. I am 


a re

a member of the “younger 
generation,” and J care about 
how the world will be for the 
next generation — my kids — 
for it’s they who will lave to 
deal with our mistakes and 
irresponsibilities. I praise the 
twelve individuals who were 
there, and wish them the best 
of luck in their recycling at- 


tempts.

proceeded to dowse it with water. 

7, Thesuspect states that he then checked the second brush 
pile to the East of the one which had re-kindled itself, and could 
find no sign of fire, smoke or heat in inat pile going so far as to 
place his hands down inside the brush pile in an effort to 
determine if there was any indication of smoldering. 

8. Thesuspect then continued tocheck this pilc #2 periodi- 
cally for any signs of fire, smoke or heat and finding none, 
continued to pick up his property and hand pile brushon the site 
of the second brush pile. 

9. Interviews with neighbors indicate that there had been 
no buming on the subject property since the re-kindling inci- 
dent of April 16, 1990, and that one neighbor was on the day 
of the fire at the back of his own property where he could 
plainly sce the suspect's property and that immediately prior to 
3:30 p.m., there was no one on that property nor was there any 
sign of smoke or fire. Shortly after 3:30 p.m. this same 
neighbor observed that two of the brush piles were burning and 
there was no sign of anyone in the vicinity. 

10. That approximately 1:30 p.m., being approximatcly 
two hours prior to the start of the fire, a DNR plane had flown 
over the Thendara Road area and had not noticed any smoke or 
indication of fire at that time. 


11, Interviews with a University of Michigan Fishery Re- 
search Crew, neighbors and a Crawford AuSable Schoo! bus 
driver, indicate that with winds blowing out of the South West 
from fifteen to thirty miles an hour, the fire took less than ten 
minutes from the time that smoke and fire were spotted in the 
second brush pile until the flames reached the other brush piles 
and woods to the North and East of the suspect's property and 
was out of control. 

12. The Department of Natural Resources Fire Investiga- 
tion Team has determined that the second brush pile was the 
source of the fire and excavation of that pile revealed that in 
bulldozing the initial pile together, logs and stumps had been 
covered partially by sand and dirt. Excavation of those stumps 
from beneath the ground reveal that there were a number of 
pieces of charred wood which were extremely hot indicating 
that in fact the fire had smoldered under ground since March 
16, 1990 in much the same way as charcoal is made without 
trace of flame, smoke or heat despite snow storms of onc half 
inch or more on the 22nd, 25th, and 30th of March and again 
on several occasions in April. The extremely dry conditions 
and high winds of May 8, 1990 combined to cause this 
“charcoal-tike” substance to either re-ignite or ignite combus- 
tible substances in the vicinity which was the cause of the 
eventual forest fire which then burned Northcasterly from that 


spot. 

I conclude that Gerald Fagan did take responsible precau- 
tions before and after lighting the fire on March 16, 1990 on or 
adjacent to Forest Land as evidenced by the placing of the 
brush piles in the middle of a field which had been cut over and 
bulldozed clear and his procurement of a burning permit even 
though there was snow on the ground at the time. 

The only issue remaining is as to whether the suspect took 
reasonable precautions at all times thereafter to prevent escape 
of the fire. In that regard, I conclude that with a time lapse of 
seven to eight weeks since the permitted burning of the number 
2 brush pile (the forest fire's point of origin) combined with the 
periodic checking of the same, Mr. Fagan had taken such 
reasonable precautions under the circumstances to leave a 
reasonable person with the expectation that no fire would occur 
much less escape from the number 2 brush pile on May 8, 1990. 

Accordingly, I would decline the Department of Natural 
Resources’ request for a criminal misdemeanor warrant, My 
decision would have no impact or effect on any civil liability 
which Mr. Fagan may have incurred as a result of his conduct 
between March 16th and May 8, 1990.

disposal problems, Each time 
a tire is retreaded a trip to the 
landfill can be avoided. 
According to Bill Herd, 
Bandag’s senior vice-presi- 
dentsalesand marketing, ‘The 
average truck tire can be re- 
treaded two or three times 
before the disposal options 
must be considered.” 
Herd also noted thatretreads 
are getting a bad rap concerm- 
ing the scrap rubber found 
along our highways. He said, 
“Laboratory analysis has 
found that half of the scrap 
rubber comes from new rather 
than retreaded tires. The real 
answer to the problem of scrap 
rubber on the highways is for 
the operators of trucks to be 
more careful about proper air 
pressure inflation, matching 
tire sizes, prompt repair of 
damaged tires, and making 
sure the tires are not loaded 
above their rated capacity.”

mean you pay less interest, and when you get a pre-

staying in Grayling,” he con- 
tinued, “and T think that is 
really important.” 

In addition to keeping the 
Fox Run Country Club open 


as a public golf course, 
DeWitt’s future plans include 
developing the 70 acres lo- 
cated in the middle of the golf 
course with condominiums, 
duplexes and individual 
homes. 

“Rox Run has been certi- 
fied and rated by the USGA 


and we have received numer- 
ous compliments from golf 
pros from surrounding 
courses,” said DeWitt, “That 
means a lot to me.” 

“Our course is just like the 
potatochip,” laughed DeWitt, 
“you can’t play the course 
once, you will come back and

offers a limited number of | 
memberships and has men’s, i

Fox Run offers several ex- 
ceptional “Stay and Play” 
packages that includes lodg- 
ing in the Grayling arca, 

The course’s first hole-in- 
one was made by Lou Jansen, 
of Harrisville, who captured 
the course record on May 12 
on the 17 hole using an cight 
iron, It was the first hole-in- 
one Jansen had ever made. 

Fox Run Country Club took 
nearly two years to complete 
and during that time owner/ 
manager Jerry DeWitt took an 
active roll in its construction. 
s He worked as his own gencral 
contractor as well as helping 
with the design of the course 
and the interior decoration of 
the clubhouse. DeWitt has 
been a real estate broker for 
the past 28 years, but said 
operating the golf course 
would be his job for the re- 
mainder of his working ca- 
reer. 

“Since I began construction, 
the Grayling Country Clubhas 
enlarged their golf course to 
18-holes,” said DeWitt. “Tam 
extremely pleased they went 
ahead with that decision be-

Former Vietnam POW Tells Local Guard of Ordeal 


By Don Geiss 

Mast of the Vietnamese 
who interrogated Amencan 
Prisoners of War were not 
professional interrogators and 
so they often tortured prison- 
ers £0 death, 

That statement was made 
recenuy by Lt. Col. Donald E. 
ODell, U.S. Air Force (Ret.) 
when he spoke to members of 
the 1071st Heavy Mainte- 
nance Company at Camp 
Grayling. The company, 
composed of many local men 
and women was involved in 


their two week annual train- 
ing and ODell spoke to them 
as part of the classroom exer- 
cises, 

Capt. Kenneth Arndt of 
Gaylord, Michigan National 
Guard Commander of the 
1071 st, introduced the speaker 
who had heticoptered in from 
Selfridge National Guard Air 
Force Base for the occasion. 
He noted that ODell was shot 
down during his 17th mission 
on the 17th of October, 1967. 
He said that he had spent 
almost six years as a prisoner. 


PUBLIC NOTICE 


ODell said that the Viet- 
namesc alwaysconsidered the 
men as war criminals and not 
prisoners of war so that they 
were not bound by any trea- 
ties conceming POW's. He 
commented that only 16 
people that he knew of at- 
tempted ta escape and only 
one survived. That man was 
tortured to death, he said, He 
noted “We could not sce it 
because there were no win- 
dows inourcells, but we could 
hear his screams.”

Increasing Property 


Taxes 


Please take notice that on June 1, 1990, at 
12:00 o'clock noon at the middle schoo! 
conference room the Board of Education of the 
Crawford AuSable School District wil! hold a 
public hearing on the levying in 1990 of an 
additional proposed additional 
8108 mills for operating purposes pursuant to 
Act 5, Public Acts of Michigan, 1982. 


The Board of Education has the complete 
authority to establish that 28.35 mills be levied in 
1990 from within its present authorized millage 


The maximum additional proposed millage rate 
would increase revenues for operating purposes 
from ad valorem property tax levies in 1989 
otherwise permitted by Act 5, Public Acts of 
Michigan, 1982, by nine and 12/100 percent 


The figure for increase in revenue for operating 
purposes is based on the latest estimate of state 
equalized valuation of property located within the 
school district. State equalized valuation will not 
be finalized until after the fourth Monday in May. 
In the event that state equalized valuation as 
finalized is for any reason higher than the 
estimate used for this hearing, the Board of 
Education must hold another public hearing 
betore levying millage on any higher valuation. 


The purpose of the hearing is to receive 
testimony and discuss the levy of an additional 
less than seven (7) days 
following the public hearing, the Board of 
Education may approve all or any portion of the 
proposed additional millage rate.

the prisoners but, he said, we 
fured out a code any way that 
they could never break, The 
messages were tapped out on 
the walls and traveled through 
them although they were. as 
much asthree foot thick stone. 
ODell said that most of the 
men who died did so at what 
called the Hanoi Hilton. In 
one case a man was tortured 
so badly that it was necessary 
for his partners to force feed 
him, The Vietnamese then 
tossed him into solitary con- 
finement where, of course, he 
starved to death, he stated. 
ODell has been the recipi- 
ent of many military awards 
including the Silver Star, 
Legion of Merit, Bronze Star 
Medal for Valor, Distin- 
guished Flying Cross, Atr 
Medal, and the Purple Heart.

Affairs Officer. 

ODell was stationed in 
Thailand and the missions he 
flew were designed to slow 
the flow of war materials 
headed south. Prior to his 
departure for Southeast Asia, 
he was assigned to the 94th 
Fighter Interceptor Squadron 
stationed at ScHridge (Eddie 
Rickenbacker’s old squadron 
from World War I). 

The survival rate in the 
camps was about 36 percent, 
ODclt said, with torture, dis- 
case, and starvation all taking 
their toll. 

In answer tO a question 
about his feelings when he 
boarded the plane to take him 
home, ODcH noted that even 
when the mencame in sight of 
the planc at the airport, they 
still believed it was a Viet- 
namese trick. When they

One Pipeline Fails 
Camp's Underground Tanks Pass Test 


Camp Grayling Com- 
mander Lieutenant Colonel 
Wayne Koppa today an- 
nounced the results of an 
underground fuci tank testing 
program for the National 
Guard's Northern Michigan 
training facility. ; 

“An independent contrac- 
tor tested our six underground 
single-wall tanks and found 
them all to hold pressure which 
indicates the tanks arcen’tleak- 
ing,” said Koppa. “The one 
blemish in the otherwise good 
results was a failure of the 


IN CELEBRATION-- The residents of 


piping above one gasoline tank 
tohold pressure. After notify- 
ing DNR we uncovered the 
tanks top to expose the piping 
forrepair, ‘che dirt around the 
tank that tested positive for 
gasoline was disposed of ac- 
cording to DNR procedures. 
There is no evidence of any 
threat to public health or wild- 
life.” 

“My cnvironmental staff 
tells rne it is not uncommon 
for these older underground 
tanks to have some contami- 
nated soil around them,” said 


Meadows of Grayling celebrated 


Koppa, ‘but this one had more 
than normal so [ ordered the 
tank drained and removed so 
we could dig underneath it. 
We've also hired a consultant 
to test and determine if any 
gasoline has seeped beyond 
the immediate vicinity of the 
tanks. We should have his test 
results yet this monthand then 
we'll compicte the cleanup.”

Both the gas tank and its 
piping passcd a similar test 
three years ago. 

“The underground tank 
removal program ts part of a 
larger environmental risk re- 
duction program at the Camp 
that includes the conversion 
to natural gas,” said Koppa. 
“The conversion to gas will 
permit the removal of all the 
fuel oil tanks, which consut- 
tute the majority of the Camp's 
lcakage problem, The gas tine 
to the Camp was completed 
last year and replacement has 
begun of the hundreds of small 
fuct oil tanks that supply the 
hot water heaters in the 
Camp's barracks,” he said.

Confessing Sin 


Before one will consider 
confession of sins, there must 
be a knowledge of sins to 
confess. “If we say that we 
have no sin, we deccive our- 
selves, and the truth is not in 
us.” (John 1:8). Sin is de- 
ceptive! Every human is a 
sinner before God. (I Kings 
8:46, 2 Chr, 6:36; Psa. 143:2; 
and Isa. 64:6). “There is nota 
justman upon carth, thatdocth 
good, and sinneth not,” 
(Ecclesiastes 7:20). ‘For ail 
have sinned, and come short 
of the glory of God.” (Ro- 
mans 3:23), Sin is any lack of 
conformity to the will or word 
of God by thought, word, or 
deed. Onc whoclaims no sins 
to confess is deceived and 
living a lie. 

Aswe become aware of sins 
in our lives, we must confess 
and forsake them to have vic-

tory. “If we confess our sins, 
he is faithful and just to for- 
give us our sins, and to cleanse 
us from all unrightcousness.” 
(I John 1:9). “He that cover- 
eth his sins shalt not prosper: 
but whoso confesscth and 
forsaketh them shall have 
mercy.” (Pro. 28:13). Allsins 
are first against a Holy God. 
Even David when he commit- 
ted adulicry made this confes- 
sion: ‘For I acknowledge my 
transgressions: and my sin is 
ever before me. Against thee, 
thee only, have I sinned, and 
done this evil in thy sight...” 
(Psa. 51:3, 4a). To confess 
means to sce our sins in the 
same way Godsces them. One 
who truly confesses sin be- 
fore God will hate the sin and 
stop the practice of it. 

The worst thing a Christian 
can do is deny any sins to 
confess. “If we say that we 
have not sinned, we make him 
a liar, and his word is not in 
us.” (I John 1:10). Paul is

REMEMBER 


THOSE... 


Throughout this century, World 
War I, World War II. Korea and 
Vietnam have claymed the lives of 
countless men and women who had 
not yet begun to live. 

The blood they shed and the tears 
of loved ones teft behind contributed 
tothe stream of democracy and justice 
which flows through every city and 
town in this great country of ours. 


This Memonia!l Day, whether we 
celebrate or just relax at home, it 


In Vain. 


MAY 


Copynght 1890 Kester Wiha Neasvare oerecus PO) Bor BOOS Craristasaitie VA D2OE 


would be fitting to remember and to 
honor those brave and selfless men 
and women who are not among us 
today. In addition, throughout the year 
may we exercise those rights for 
which they died, that they did not die 


Let us pray that all nations will be 
moved to solve their differences 
through negotiation rather than war, 
so that future lives might be spared.

mer, you should note that 
special rules affect the report- 
ing Of eamings from many 
typical summer jobs for So- 
cial Security purposes. Be- 
come familiar with the rules 
10 assure your carnings are 
reported and you receive 
important Social Security 
protection. 

With most jobs, Social 
Security taxes (FICA) are 
automatically deducted from 
your paycheck, and your 
employer pays a matching 
amount, reports the total to 
Social Security, and sends thre 
taxes to the Interna! Revenue 
Service (IRS).

Doodles from the T 


By Wendall L. Hoover 


It seems like every hile 
puddle of water around the 
country side has a duck or 
rather a pair of ducks sitting in 
its middic. Nearly everytime, 
it is a pair of mallards looking 
for a suitable place to raise a 
brood, or at least taking a rest. 

The fatin name of Anas 
platyrhynchos may mean 
somcthing to an ornithologist, 
but for me at feast it docs little 
to describe what is commonly 
called a Greenhead or French 
Duck. The malc has a large 
glossy green head, yellow bill, 
a white collar and reddish 
orange legs. The female is 
typically of less noteworthy 
colors that allows her to blend

in with the surroundings. The 
nest is relatively near water, 
but is well hidden. 

Most of their food is vege- 
table matier; smart weeds, 
sedges, bulrush seeds, duck 
weed, wild celery, wild nce, 
acoms and they are excellent 
destroyers of mosquito larvae, 
being better than goldfish for 
this purpose. 

While mallards appear to 
be slow flyers, they can make 
an casy 60 m.p.h. which is 
well, because they migrate to 
southern climates in the fall. 
For now, the areca waterways 


will play host to this most 
common of the wild ducks. 


THE TALKING TREE 


While walking along the river one day 

| stopped to rest beneath a tall pine tree 

As | sat there listening to the breeze in it’s boughs 
1 discovered it was talking to me 


The tree said “I've been here a long time son 
I've seen a lot of changes in my time 

I've seen these barren hills and valleys 

When they were covered with tall straight pine 


Back in the days when | was young 

lsaw plenty of birch bark canoes on that stream 
But the Indian did no harm to the land 

| took comfort in his carnp fires gleam 


He hunted and fished along that stream 
To provide the food they needed 

Tnen the fur traders came along 

And his call for furs was heeded 


Soon the beaver was gone from the river 
{ heard the reason for that 

Was that the fur of my friend the beaver 
Was used to make a rich man a hat 


Then one day some men came along 

Who thought of nothing but pine 

They chopped and sawed from dark to dark 
Till the only shade left was mine 


twas small and twisted 


Not worth the lumber jacks time” 
Such a story was told to me 
By a now tall and stately pine 


detachment of 30 young men 
from Alpena in April 1943 
and served at the Grayling 
Airport for 30 days. 

Last Thursday nightatabout 
11 o’clock the house owned 
by Mrs. Nels Corwin and 
occupied by Mrs. Frank Mal- 
loy, located at the comer of 
Spruce and Lake Sts. caught 
fire, and the alarm was sentin. 

The Grayling fire depart- 
ment quickly responded, and 
soon had the flames under 
control and out. Damage was 
estimated at $200. Mrs. 
Malloy’s son and wife built a 
fire to warm the house, which 
had been closed for some time. 
While waiting for the housc to 
heat up they left to get tunch. 
The fire originated in the attic 
and is attributed to a defective 
flue. 

Donald Leonard, Director 
of Civitian Defensc, an- 
nounces a plan for heralding 
to the county the news of the 
European invasion when it 
comes. The day to be offi- 
Cially observed as D-Day will 
be designated by the Gover- 
hor to guard against prema- 
ture observances based on 
false invasion reports and to 
provide for simultaneous onc- 
minute pause. The day will 
be chosen immediately when 
it is authentic that the inva- 
sion is under way. Alta time 
designed in the Governor's 
message air raid sirens, fac- 
tory whistles, church bells and 
other audible signals are to be 
sounded for 90 seconds, This 
is to be followed by a cessa- 
tion of all activities for onc 
minute, which is to be given 
over in silent prayer. Traffic 
istocome toa halt and activi- 
tics ccase in stores, factorics, 
schools and elsewhere.

The children and teacher of 
the Richardson School in

Lake Margrethe Nourishes Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle 


By Irene Pettyjoha 

Cowabunga, Dude! Crawford County has its own Tecnage 
Mutant Ninja Turtle! 

Raphael, the crime fighter wearing the red mask, becomes 
ihe witty wise-cracking Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle each 
time the voice of Rob Paulsen, the son of Lee and Robert 
Paulsen, of Lake Margrethe, brings the script and cartoon 
character to life. Paulsen has been Raphael’s voice since the 
animated cartoon series began about three years ago. 

Paulsen, a native of Grand Blanc, spent his summers in the 
Grayling area for many years. His grandmother, Matilda 
Paulsen, is a Grayling resident, as are several of his aunts and 
cousins. His parents built their cottage at Lake Margrethe in 

1961 and now make it their full time residence. 

“Lee and the kids spent their summers in Grayling and I was 
a weekend father,” said Robert. “Rob learned to fish on Lake 
Margrethe.” 

Robert said one parucular fishing excursion that stands out 
in his memory occurred at the Bud Joyce residence on Lake 
Margrethe. He said he and hts wife had gone to visit the Bud 
Joyces and Rob had taken along his fishing pole, hoping to be 
able to fish. Bud told Rob he could go down to the lake and fish 
off his dock. 

“He never caught much,” said Rob’s father, “Maybe a perch 
ortwo. But on this day, it wasn’t long before we heard Rob 
yelling about the big fish he had caught,” he said. “Come to 
find out, he had caught Bud's pet bass that lived under his 
dock.” 

Rob’s first paying job was in Grayling, working for his 
cousin, Bill Greene, at Bill’s Standard gas station when he was 
sixteen years old. 

Rob began his entertainment career in high school when he 
sang with the LS Freaks. He went on to sing for two years with 
“Sass”, a group popular in the Flint area. He attended the 
University of Michigan for one year before he moved to 
California to pursue a show business carcer. 

The move to California did not come as a surprise to Rob’s 
parents. 

“Rob was eleven or twelve when he began mimicking,” said 
his father, “He has always loved to act and sing and was always 
acut-up. Now Rob tell us, ‘I’m getting paid big money to do 
what I used to get in trouble for doing in school’.” 

During a telephone interview several weeks ago, Rob said he 
never dreamed when he auditioned for the voice of Raphael 
that three years later it would be a $600,000,000 business or 
that the cartoon series would be televised in 20 or 30 countries. 

He characterized Raphael as a rude, crude dude, who bran- 
dishes his rapier-like wit with comments such as, “We fight for 
truth, justice, and a bigger slice of pizza!” 

“In the show, none of the turtles take themselves too seri- 
ously,” said Rob, “especially Raphael who is pretty tongue in 
cheek about the whole business.” 

Rob said he thoroughly enjoys his work and would probably 
be doing something like it, even if he could not make a living 
‘at it. He said the actors doing the turtle voice-overs are 
encouraged to improvise and ad lib during the tapings, which

makes the job even more enjoyable. 

“Voice-over work is hard to break into,” stated Rob. “and is 
made up of a group of extremely talented actors.” 

Success does not appear to-have spoiled the Michigander 
who says the cartoon show ts the star, not him. Rob said he and 
the three other men who do the turtle voice-overs were just 
lucky to be at the right audition. 

“You never know when you take on an audition what is 
going to come from it,” he said. 

The voices of the other ninja turtles are Cam Clark as 
Leonardo, Townsend Coleman as Michaelangelo, and Barry 
Gordon as Donatello. Rob said Gordon is probably the most 
recognizable of the actors. Besides his current roll on the TV 
serics A Family for Joe with Robert Mitchum, Gordon played 
the accountant on Archie Bunker for many years and is the 
president of the Screen Actor's Guild. 

Because of the popularity of the Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles among children, Rob has used his celebrity status to 
call children who are seriously ill and talk to them as Raphael. 
The parents of the children say their children are thrilled, 
regardless of how ill they are. 

Ashton, Rob’s five-year old son, realizes that his father is 
Raphael and tells him, “Daddy, you really got Shredder today,” 
or ‘You helped April O'Neil (TV reporter and friend of the 
tures) today,” buthavinga celebrity fora father does notseem 
all that important to him. 


Rob’s credits include TV appearances on Love American 
Style and MacGyver, movie parts in Body Double, Stewardess 
School and The Perfect Match. In addition to being the voice 


of Raphael, Rob was the voice of Rude Dog, Boober and: 


Madam Trashpile on Fraggle Rock, and Weepy on the Smurfs. 

Beginning in June, Rob will begin recording the voice of the 
robot, Rewind, for the Hanna Barbara production of “Wake, 
Rattle and Roll”, a live action moming children’s show that 
will air five days a week beginning this fall. Rob will also be 
working on a Warmer Brothers cartoon adventure that will be 
produced by Steven Spielberg 

Meanwhile turtle mania continues strong. Rob said CBS has 
picked up the syndicated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles car- 


toon series and plans to televise it for an hour every Saturday 
moming this fall. 

The idea of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was developed 
by a student from the University of Massachusetts and an 
illustrator in 1983, as comic book characters. 

The story line goes something like this: A ninja master, who 
had left his homeland in disgrace, took refuge in the sewers of 
New York to hide from his enemies. While in hiding, the ninja 
master befriended some rats. About this same time four turtles 
were accidently dropped into the sewer by a teenager. 

The ninja’s enemies poured radioactive green goo inio the 
sewer inanattemptto get rid of the ninja leader, When the ninja 
and turtles came in contact with the green goo they mutated 
into part themselves and part the last living being they had been 
with. The rat taught the half-shelled mutants the art of ninja 
fighting and now on a weekly basis, they all go forth to battle 
evil, 

The cartoon series has taken off in a big way, capturing a 
following who are immediately identified by their use of such 
terminology as “dude, cowabunga, awesome, and turtle power!” 
Turtle mania has produced a wide-range of merchandising 
paraphernalia that includes T-shirts, cereal, reproductions of 
the turtle characters and video games, just to name a few. Ithas 
just been released as a movie that is capturing an audicnce of 
all ages. 

The story doesn’t reveal the nationality of the teenage 
turtles, but they adopted the names of four famous renaissance 
artists, Michaelangelo, Leonardo, Donatetlo and Raphael, and 
get their “turtle power” from pizza, The ninja rat is called 
Splinter. 

Robisnot the only Paulsen offspring smitten by the quest for 
stardom. Mike Paulsen is a singer, dancer, actor, living in New 
York pursuing a career on the stage and Lori Paulsen is an 
assistant to a television executive with the Fox Television 
Network. Only daughter, Shelley, appears to have resisted the 
call. 


Looking back a generation, it was discovered that the Paulsen 
children may have inherited their singing and acting talents 
from their parents. Robertadmitted to doing “a little radio and

deemed an immediate goal. 

Officials discussed at the mecting various awards that might 
be given and widespread media coverage that would counter- 
act some negative pubdlicity that the employers have been 
receiving. 

Steps leading to the establishment of a non-profit status for 
PEP were also discussed and a committee appointed to write 
constitution and by-laws. The organization is made up of grass 
roots citizens who have a desire to recognize the employers and 
demonstrate their appreciation for the economic progress that 
they represent. 

The groupat the same time recognized the need to protect the 
environment and to temper all development with a care fo- the 
tourism future that is dependent upon the fragile land and water 
offerings. They agreed that later projects will include enhance- 
ment of the outdoors, a spokesperson said. 

In order to bring membership in the organization within the 
financial range of all interested persons, $5 was established as 
the yearly dues. Those interested in joining the group may 
contact acting membership chairman Don Geiss at R # 1 Box

enjoyed singing. 

The Detroit Civic Theatre was a professional touring group 
that performed wherever there was anaudience. The perform- 
ers were paid after expenses which Robert said was rare. 

Robert said one of the young men he consistently competed 
with for rolls later wenton to New York anda successful carcer 
on Broadway and motion pictures. The actor’s name is George 
Peppard. 

Maybe the old saying that the “apple never falls far from the 
tree” is especially truc for the Paulsen family.
