DEDICATION 


I  dedicate  this  work  to  Mr.  Joaquin  Salmeron,  Director  of  the 
Museum  Siyasa  of  Cieza  (Murcia)  in  Spain. 

Thanks  to  his  enthusiasm  and  generous  help  I  could  initiate  the 
investigation  of  the  Alquerque-12  game  in  Spain.

FOREWORD 


The  reason  to  write  three  volumes  about  alquerque-12  was  due 
to  the  fact  that  there  are  researchers  who  affirm  that  alquerque- 
12  was  a  very  popular  game  in  France.  On  the  other  hand  they 
confirm  that  alquerque-12  is  a  draughts  game  played  in  the 
Roman  times.  In  Volume  I  we  have  shown  that  the  alquerque- 
12  board  was  not  popular  in  France,  but  in  Spain  while  in 
Volume  II  it  becomes  clear  that  the  game  was  also  very  popular 
in  Portugal  and  Italy. 

In  the  case  of  Spain  we  observe  that  the  game  was  played  more 
in  the  northern  provinces  than  in  the  southern  ones,  which 
invalidates  the  general  opinion  that  the  game  had  been  brought 
to  Spain  by  the  Arabs. 

Researchers  are  always  referring  to  the  fact  that  alquerque  or 
Quirkat  was  being  played  throughout  Egypt.  In  this  sense  we 
have  to  take  into  account  that  with  regards  to  the  alquerque 
games  we  have  three  man  morris,  six  man  morris,  nine  man 
morris,  and  twelve  man  morris.  Each  game  was  played  in  a 
certain  period. 

Most  historians  and  archaeologists  were  following  Murray,  and 
stated  that  alquerque-12  was  native  to  Egypt  in  the  14th  and 
13th  century  B.C.,  because  boards  had  been  found  carved  into 
the  blocks  of  stone  that  form  the  Luxor  temple’s  roof  in  Kurna,

Egypt.  However,  alquerque-12  has  nothing  to  do  with  this 
period.  At  first  Friedrich  Berger  states  that  the  drawings  cannot 
be  dated  due  to  Coptic  (Christian)  crosses.  Secondly  the 
German  archaeologist  and  Egyptologist  Rainer  Stadelmann 
came  to  a  similar  conclusion  with  good  documentary  evidence. 
Research  of  the  Dutchman  Wim  Van  Mourik  and  Dr. 
Stadelmann  clearly  proves  that  the  drawing  by  Parker  was  not 
the  correct  one  and  was  completely  different  from  the  drawing 
shown  in  Stadelmann's  photo.  For  that  reason  we  can  state  today 
that  the  Kuma  temple  had  nothing  to  do  with  alquerque-12  and 
draughts. 

Alquerque-12  in  various  countries  always  had  to  do  with 
Christians  and  the  church.  It  was  probably  played  by  the  church 
authorities,  European  crusaders,  Knight  Templars,  Knights  of 
the  Order  of  Santiago,  and  other  soldiers.  For  that  reason  we 
hypothesise  that  the  game  was  an  invention  of  or  related  to  the 
activities  of  the  Catholic  Church  not  earlier  than  the  sixth 
century. 

We  have  to  be  careful  in  considering  all  alquerque-12  drawings 
as  board  games.  There  are  many  vertical  drawings  of  alquerque- 
12  that  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  board  game,  since  they 
could  have  been  used  for  apotropaic  and  esoteric  practices.  In 
this  respect  one  can  take  into  account  the  Knights  Templar  and 
their  carvings  at  the  Donjon  du  Coudray,  Chinon  (France). 


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

I  thank  Mr.  Rob  Jansen  (Amsterdam)  for  his  deep  research  of 
alquerque-12  documents  and  images  for  years.  Without  his 
collaboration  this  book  could  never  have  been  written.  I  also 
send  words  of  thanks  to  Dr.  Ulrich  Schadler  (Switzerland)  who 
generously  gave  me  a  lot  of  critical  notes.  The  fact  that  I  did  not 


VII 


use  them  in  this  book  has  to  do  with  adverse  personal  circumstances.  I 
thank  Marisa  Uberti  (Italy)  for  her  comments  and  images.  Dr. 
Franco  Pratesi  (Italy)  also  gave  me  a  lot  of  information  about 
Italy.  The  draughts  icon  researcher  Wim  van  Mourik  (Holland) 
kept  me  posted  about  his  alquerque-12  researchers.  Dr.  Jorge 
Nuno  Silva  (Portugal)  was  kind  to  facilitate  me  several  images 
of  alquerque-12  boards.  The  anthropologist  and  archaeologist 
Luis  Lobato  de  Faria  (Portugal)  has  found  many  alquerque-12 
boards  and  drawings  and  kept  me  posted  about  them.  I  thank 
him  very  much  for  his  efforts  to  bring  so  many  boards  to  light! 

More  people  have  collaborated  on  the  preparation  of  this  book 
and  it  is  not  possible  to  mention  all  of  them.  Thanks  to  all  of 
you!

1  THE  GAMES  IN  ANCIENT  TIMES 


There  are  several  reasons  why  I  did  such  a  profound  study  of 
the  Alquerque-12  game.  The  main  reason  is  that  I  believe  that 
this  game  was  the  precursor  of  draughts,  a  game  invented  in 
Valencia  around  1495. 

Scholars  still  disagree  on  where  chess  was  invented.  According 
to  Pavle  Bidev  and  David  H  Li  it  was  China,  others  talk  about 
India,  and  others  about  one  of  the  Arab  countries.  The  current 
chess  game  is  the  result  of  huge  development  of  its  pieces  and 
movements.  Therefore  our  current  chess  game  has  also  very 
little  to  do  with  the  first  chess  game. 

The  draughts  game  as  we  know  it  today  in  Spain  arose  from  the 
Alquerque-12  and  chess1 2 3.  Most  historians  of  draughts  still  do 
not  agree  on  where  this  game  originated.  It  appears  from  the 
Internet  that  people  already  played  draughts  in  the  Egyptian 
times  about  4000  years  ago.  Others  refer  to  the  period  of  the 
Roman  Empire  and  still  others  to  the  Middle  Ages.  In  addition 
to  this  we  have  the  problem  that  there  exist  many  varieties  of 
the  draughts  game  on  the  chessboard,  which  the  research  does 
not  facilitate.  History  is  a  science  that  requires  documentary 
proofs.  In  this  sense  it  immediately  stands  out  that  the  the

draughts  game  in  earlier  times  was  played  on  a  chessboard  and 
this  is  still  the  case  in  Spain  and  other  countries.  The  first 
precursor  of  draughts  is  the  game  of  Alquerque-12  played  with 
the  aid  of  lines  and  of  which  the  drawing  board  has  12  pawns  on 
both  sides 


Hansel  and  GretePs  Little  John  and  Little  Margaret  is  a  well- 
known  fairy  tale  of  German  origin  recorded  by  the  Grimm 
Brothers  and  published  in  1812.  Everybody  knows  this  tale. 
And  now  I  will  draw  your  attention  to  some  fairy  tales  about  the 
Alquerque-12  and  the  draughts  (checkers).  In  internet  we  see  for 
example  the  following  statement: 

The  game  of  checkers,  or  a  game  very  similar  to  it,  has  been  played 
for  thousands  of  years.  Known  throughout  history  as  ’’alquerque”  (in 
ancient  Egypt),  "fierges"  or  "ferses"  in  France,  "jeu  de  dames”, 
"dames”  (also  in  France,  though  later),  "draughts”  in  England, 
"plaisant"  in  Holland  (or  possibly  France),  and  finally  "checkers"  after 
it  reached  North  America,  checkers  is  a  simple  game  played  with  flat 
discs  on  a  board  covered  in  alternating  light  and  dark  squares 


Another  website  says  the  following: 

History  of  Checkers 

Checkers  has  quite  a  long  history  with  international  appeal.  A  board 
that  was  similar  to  a  checkers  board  was  found  during  an 
archeological  excavation  in  the  Middle  East.  Surprisingly  the  board 
carbon  dated  back  to  3000  B.C..  Unfortunately  it  is  impossible  to 
determine  whether  the  rules  were  similar  to  modem  day  checkers, 
even  though  the  numbers  of  pieces  were  different  from  today’s  game. 

Next  in  checkers  history  we  jump  forward  in  time  to  1400  B.C.  At 
that  time  Alquerque  or  Quirkat  was  being  played  throughout  Egypt. 
Depictions  of  the  game  were  even  carved  into  the  walls  of  sacred 
temples.  The  size  of  the  board  was  different  (5x5),  and  the  pieces 
moved  along  intersections  of  lines  instead  of  diagonally  from  square 


to  square;  but  the  game  was  otherwise  thought  to  be  similar  to  modern 
day  checkers.  The  pieces  of  alquerque  were  flat  and  circular  and  were 
even  separated  into  light  and  dark  colors.  In  addition,  the  goal  was 
similar:  capture  the  pieces  of  the  other  player.  Alquerque  was  even 
discussed  by  the  greatest  minds  of  the  time  -  Plato  and  Homer. 

Moving  forward  on  the  timeline  we  come  to  the  12th  century  A.D. 
and  the  birth  of  modern  day  checkers.  It  is  thought  that  a  Frenchman 
converted  the  rules  and  game  pieces  of  ancient  alquerque  to  an  8x8 
chessboard  and  played  with  a  dozen  pieces  on  each  side.  And.... 
checkers  was  bom.  The  French  named  this  game  Fierges  and  called 
the  pieces  ferses. 

By  the  15th  century  A.D.  the  name  of  the  game  had  changed,  but  the 
rules  remained  pretty  much  the  same.  Those  playing  at  that  time 
called  it  Jeu  de  Dames,  or  Dames.  When  the  French  decided  that  the 
player  must  jump  the  opponent’s  pieces  (if  possible),  they  changed 
the  name  again  -  this  time  to  Jeu  Force. 

Jeu  Force  then  traveled  across  the  Channel  to  England.  There  it 
received  yet  another  name,  Draughts.  In  the  18th  century  the  board 
was  changed  again  to  a  10x10  structure  with  twenty  pieces  on  each 
side  and  was  called  Plaisant.  This  structure  probably  arose  from 
players  in  Holland.  Only  when  the  game  crossed  the  Atlantic  to  North 
America  did  it  gain  the  name  we  all  know  -  checkers. 

Who  is  the  man  who  is  partially  responsible  for  these  nice 
stories?  This  is  nobody  else  than  the  famous  board  game 
specialist  Harold  James  Ruthven  Murray  (1868  -  1955).  In 
1913  he  published  his  most  significant  workv4  History  of  Chess , 
proposing  the  theory  that  chess  originated  in  India.  Justin  du 
Coeur  gives  us  a  very  good  idea  of  who  Murray  was  in  the  past: 

Many  books  with  this  title  have  been  written  over  the  years,  but  this  is 
the  one  that  really  counts;  while  the  scholarship  has  advanced  a  little 
since  Murray’s  day,  it’s  still  the  case  that  everyone  starts  here  and  then 
moves  forward.  If  you  are  to  have  only  one  book  on  period  chess,  this 
is  the  one  to  have.  It’s  an  enormous  tome  (900  pages),  and  the  vast 
majority  of  it  is  devoted  to  the  pre-1600  history  of  the  game.  Once  the 
game  stabilizes  in  the  early  modern  period,  Murray  seems  to  mostly 


lose  interest.  Murray  goes  into  minute  detail  about  every  aspect  of  the 
game,  discussing  not  only  the  rules,  but  also  issues  like  the  literature 
written  in  period  using  chess  as  a  metaphor,  three  chapters  on  period 
chess  problems,  and  of  course  descriptions  of  every  known  early 
variant  of  chess  (of  which  there  were  many).  The  scholarship  is 
impeccable;  not  only  does  the  book  discuss  pretty  much  every  known 
source  in  detail,  it  includes  great  swathes  of  medieval  texts  on  the 
subject  in  Latin,  Spanish,  English,  and  other  languages.  This  is  not  a 
book  for  the  casual  reader;  it  is  enormous  and  dense.  But  for  anyone 
seriously  interested  in  the  subject  of  period  chess  it  is  the  most  vital 
book  on  the  subject4. 

In  1952  Murray  published  A  History  of  Board  Games  other  than 
Chess,  proposing  the  theory  that  Alquerque-12  originated  in 
Egypt  and  the  draughts  game  in  France.  Since  his  famous  book 
about  the  history  of  chess  in  1913  everybody  believed  what  the 
great  board  specialist  Murray  was  saying,  because  he  was  and 
continued  being  one  of  the  greatest  board  game  specialists. 
Many  historians  think  that  Murray  is  infallible,  but  this  idea  will 
only  paralyze  future  work  of  others. 

Murray  dominated  English,  German,  Latin,  Norman-French, 
and  it  was  wonderful  to  see  that  he  at  a  later  age  also  learned 
Arabic  in  order  to  discuss  the  Arabic  chess  manuscripts. 
However,  he  did  not  know  the  Spanish  language  like  many 
others  and  so  he  was  not  aware  of  the  important  chess  and 
draughts  history  of  Spain.  He  knew  a  lot  of  the  history  of 
draughts  from  William  Shelley  Branch  (1854  -  1933)  without 
mentioning  him.  Murray  copied  historical  pages  from  other 
historians  without  mentioning  them  on  several  occasions.  A 
really  strange  matter,  because  sooner  or  later  everybody  would 
know  that.

1.1  The  world  on  its  head 

The  draughts  historian  Dr.  Arie  van  der  Stoep  turned  the 
world  on  its  head  in  2006. 

Considering  that  on  a  backgammon  board  of  King  Alfonso  X  of 
Castile  fifteen  games  could  be  played,  it  is  also  reasonable  to 
conclude  that  on  the  board  to  be  used  for  Alquerque-12  different 
games  could  have  been  played  that  had  nothing  to  do  with 
Alquerque-12. 

Dr.  Arie  van  der  Stoep’s  arguments 

This  draughts  historian  turned  the  world  on  its  head  in  2006 
when  he  confirmed5  that  Draughts  already  existed  more  than 
4000  years  B.C.

In  this  sense  we  have  to  understand  that  Dr.  Van  der  Stoep 
considers  that  Alquerque-12  is  the  same  as  draughts,  something 
that  I  do  not  understand.  On  the  other  hand,  Van  der  Stoep 
introduced  a  rule  that  board  game  historians  never  applied 
before  linguistics.  The  use  of  linguistic  methods  did  not  only 
lead  to  many  different  views  on  the  history  of  checkers  or 
draughts,  but  according  to  Van  der  Stoep  also  cast  doubts  on  the 
common  view  of  the  board  games  of  alquerque  and  chess.  Van 
der  Stoep  describes  the  history  of  draughts  as  follows: 

A  primitive  board  game  with  the  leap  capture  existed  already  forty 
centuries  ago.  People  in  Africa  moved  stones  or  shells  on  lines  drawn 
in  the  sand.  Just  like  we  do,  they  took  a  piece  by  leaping  over  it.  This 
game  was  not  yet  draughts,  for  the  pieces  moved  in  any  direction  and 
the  game  did  not  include  promotion. 


Although  this  historian  does  not  provide  proofs,  he  furthermore 
stated: 

Draughts  was  bom  between  2000  and  1500  BC  when  an  African 
devised  the  promotion.  From  this  moment  on  moving  and  taking 
backwards  was  only  permitted  with  a  piece  which  had  penetrated  the 
opponent’s  base  row.  The  new  game  was  played  on  a  latticed  board 
with  25  points,  the  two  players  each  started  with  12  pieces. 


Some  historians  showed  an  Alquerque-12  board  and  state  that: 

the  board  was  incised  into  the  roofing  slabs  of  the  temple  of  Luxor, 
built  on  the  western  side  of  the  Nile  about  1500  BC6.

The  Alquerque-12  board 


1.1.1  Alquerque-12  and  Egypt 

I  never  have  believed  in  Murray’s  hypothesis  that  draughts  was 
played  in  Egypt.  The  only  known  games  that  probably  were 
played  in  this  country  were  Senet,  Han,  and  Tau.  I  also  did  not 
believe  in  the  fact  that  the  Greeks  had  played  Draughts1 . 

1.1.2  Alquerque-12  and  the  Greek  Empire 

The  game  Diagrammismos  (Grammai)  was  the  Roman  game 
Duodecim  Scripta  and  the  Greek  game  Petteia  was  the  Roman 
game  Ludus  Latrunculorum.  However,  Van  der  Stoep  was  of 
another  opinion: 

Just  like  in  our  days  a  civilisation  produced  goods  other  people 
needed.  So  traders  travelled  to  other  parts  of  the  world,  with  their 
board  games.  According  to  the  philosopher  Plato  the  Greeks

borrowed  their  board  games  from  Egypt.  Among  these  games  was 
draughts.  It  is  unknown  in  which  age  draughts  reached  Athens,  but 
the  Greeks  played  the  game  in  the  5th  c.  BC,  under  the  name  Five 
lines  game.  The  name  is  obvious:  count  the  lines  of  the  board  above. 
Draughts  was  so  common  and  so  popular,  that  the  game  passed  into 
proverbs.  If  someone  had  to  abandon  a  favourable  position,  the  Greek 
said:  “He  must  give  up  the  holy  line”.  This  holy  line  was  the 
horizontal  centre  line  of  the  draughts  board.  Obviously  a  singleton  on 
this  line  could  not  be  taken,  may  be  only  by  a  king  of  by  an  attack  of 
two  enemy  singletons  simultaneously. 


1.1.3  Alquerque-12  and  the  Roman  Empire 

As  for  the  Roman  games,  I  had  the  same  opinion  with  regards 
to  the  Egyptian  and  Greek  games.  Draughts  was  not  played  in 
the  Roman  times.

There  were  only  four  known  Roman  board  games:  Alea,  Ludus 
duodecim  scripta,  Ludus  Latrunculorum,  and  a  game  that  the 
poet  Ovidius  described  without  saying  its  name,  but  that 
obviously  alluded  to  alquerque  3  (three  in  a  row).  Taking  into 
account  other  games  such  as  Ereser  or  Tampullen  (Alquerque- 
12)  played  by  the  Batak  population,  I  believed  in  development 
from  Ludus  Latrunculorum  to  Alquerque-12  board.  Since  I 
could  not  date  the  Ereser  or  Tampullen,  I  consequently  could 
not  prove  that  the  Alquerque-12  was  played  in  Roman  times9. 
Van  der  Stoep  saw  things  differently  and  considered  that 
Roman  people  also  played  draughts,  and  he  referred  to  the 
classic  draughts  board,  in  this  case  again  to  the  Alquerque-12 
board.  He  thought  that  the  Alquerque-12  game  in  the  Roman 
Empire  had  a  short  King10.  However,  I  do  not  find  the 
Alquerque-12  game  as  a  draughts  game,  nor  do  I  believe  in  a 
short  King  in  the  Roman  times.  More  about  that  on  the 
forthcoming  pages,  but  let  us  now  follow  Van  der  Stoep  who 
stated: 

The  ancient  Greeks  and  Romans  are  always  bracketed  together.  Did 
the  ancient  Rome  play  draughts?  Yes.  The  Roman  name  for  the  game 
was  Twelve  pieces,  again  an  understandable  name  -  see  the  classic 
draughts  board  above.  The  first  draughts  player  whose  name  we  know 
is  Publius  Mucius  Scaevola,  living  in  the  2nd  c.  BC.  He  was  said  to 
be  able  to  play  blindfolded.  As  one  of  the  fathers  of  the  Roman  civil 
code,  which  influenced  the  modem  western  legislation,  and  as  a 
member  of  the  Collegium  Pontificum,  a  sacred  college  with  political 
and  religious  authority,  he  was  one  of  Rome’s  most  reputable  citizens.

Draughts  was  a  game  for  the  elite  in  the  Roman  times  too. 

Scaevola  shows  that  in  Rome  Draught  was  played  by  the  elite. 
Contrary  to  popular  belief  in  our  time  the  game  remained  popular 
among  the  upper  classes  until  the  19th  century.  Then  it  was  eclipsed 
by  chess,  a  game  that  borrowed  twice  the  elements  from  the  draughts 
game.  But  in  Scacevol’s  time  chess  still  did  not  exist. 

So  according  to  Van  der  Stoep,  Roman  citizens  played  draughts 
between  the  1st  and  5th  century  A.D.  Here  follows  a  summary 
of  Dutch  and  English  texts11.  We  see  that  Van  der  Stoep 
considers  Alquerque-12  to  be  draughts  and  that  the  Alquerque- 
12  board,  as  the  one  figuring  in  the  Manuscript  of  King  Alfonso 
X  of  Castile,  is  still  the  same  as  the  Egyptian  draughts  board. 

Draughts  obtained  a  new  name. 

The  incorporation  of  Roman  laws  is  only  one  example  of  the  Roman 
influence  on  Europe.  Three  countries  in  particular  assimilated  Rome’s 
culture:  France,  Italy,  and  Spain,  Romance,  i.e.  Latin  speaking 
countries.  One  of  the  treasures  they  received  was  draughts.  Between 
the  1st  and  6th  c.  A.D.  earlier  the  Latin  name  of  the  game  was 
changed  into  Game  with  pieces.  There  was  a  second  board  game  with 
this  name  -  morris,  which  proves  that  draughts  and  morris  were  often 
played  together. 

A  new  long  king:  before  the  8th  c.  AD 

This  Latin  name  “game  with  pieces”  was  borrowed  by  Arab  tribes. 
Only  the  name,  alquerque ,  for  they  must  have  been  familiar  with  both 
draughts  and  morris”.  Before  the  8th  c.  AD  an  Arab  draughts  player 
thought  up  a  new  promotion  rule:  the  king  acquired  greater  freedom 
of  move.  The  long  king  was  born.  In  the  8th  c.  AD  the  Moors,  Arab 
people,  conquered  Spain.  Their  draughts,  more  lively  and  speedy  than 
the  Roman  game  with  the  short  king  -as  computer  simulations  prove  - 
conquered  the  territory  too.  In  the  13th  century  Alfonso  X,  king  of

fashionable  games,  both  profusely  explained  and  illustrated.  Draughts 
was  disposed  of  in  a  short  sloppy  sketch  of  the  rules.  Fortunately  the 
responsible  clerk  added  a  drawing  of  the  current  board  with  the

The  [very  popular]  draughts  game  transferred  to  the  chessboard: 
14th  c. 

In  France  between  1000  and  1500,  maybe  earlier,  draughts  was  very 
popular  given  the  dozens  of  expressions  based  on  the  game.  This 
popularity  might  be  responsible  for  an  innovation  made  in  the  14th 
century:  a  French  draughts  player  started  to  play  draughts  on  the 
chessboard.  This  innovation  met  with  approval,  so  much  so  that 
draughts  on  the  chequered  board  was  given  its  own  name:  French  jeu

I  cannot  agree  to  this  theory  of  Dr.  Van  der  Stoep.

de  dames ,  meaning  “game  of  the  dams  (dikes)”.  Draughts  players 
from  other  countries  on  the  Continent  adopted  this  custom  together 
with  its  name,  but  English  players  preferred  the  name  Checkers , 
literally  “game  on  the  chequered  board”. 

Introduction  of  the  huff:  15th  Century 

In  the  15th  century  a  new  innovation,  probably  again  made  in  France, 
changed  the  character  of  draughts:  capturing  became  obliged  on  the 
penalty  of  the  huff.  An  odd  practice,  this  huff:  a  player  overlooks  a 
capture  and  his  opponent  takes  the  piece  in  question  off  the  board, 
brings  it  to  his  lips,  and  blows.  The  game  with  the  huff  received  its 
own  name,  in  French  force ,  in  English  draughts ,  literally  “moving  a 
piece”.  Spanish  draughts  players  adopted  this  rule,  but  extended  it 
with  multiple  capture:  multiple  take  precedes  single  take.  As  we  have 
seen,  the  Spanish  game  is  Arabic,  the  variety  with  the  long  king.  This 
long  king  incited  Spanish  chess  players  to  replace  their  “short” 
medieval  queen  with  a  “long”  queen,  the  piece  with  the  move  of  our 
days.  The  name  of  this  new  queen  reminds  of  its  origin:  dama ,  taken 
from  the  Spanish  word  damas ,  ‘draughts’.  At  the  13th  century  court 
of  King  Alfonso  draughts  may  have  been  a  minor  game,  but  two 
centuries  later  it  was  undoubtedly  far  from  minor,  because  it  could 
influence  chess. 


1.2  Discrepancies  by  other  historians 

Van  der  Stoep  does  not  give  written  proofs  of  the  fact  that 
Alquerque-12  was  played  with  a  long  King  in  Spain  between 
the  8th  and  14th  century.  Nor  does  Van  der  Stoep  prove  the  fact 
that  Alquerque-12  was  extremely  popular  in  France  between 
1000  -  1500,  nor  does  Van  der  Stoep  prove  that  Alquerque-12 
was  transferred  to  the  chessboard  in  France  in  the  14th  century. 
However,  if  we  take  into  account  Dr.  Pratesi’s  theory,  an 

1  'J 

assumption  that  needs  more  proofs  ,  then  the  draughts  game 
was  played  before  all  among  members  of  the  leading  social

Dutch  draughts  magazine  De  Problemist,  issue  1,  February,  pp.  16-17

class.  If  this  is  true,  then  such  members  would  have  written 
books  or  manuscripts  about  the  game.  Strangely  enough,  this  is 
not  the  case  in  France,  but  only  in  Spain  and  not  in  other 
countries  in  the  16th  and  17th  centuries.  Dr.  Pratesi  is  aware 
that  he  needs  to  provide  proofs,  but  he  already  gave  an  example 
with  the  book  written  by  Giorgio  Roberti14.  Roberti,  a 
recognized  authority  on  whose  research  we  can  rely,  makes 
clear  that  draughts  was  for  a  long  time  played  almost 
exclusively  by  representatives  from  the  middle  and  upper 
classes.  Only  in  the  thirties  of  the  20th  century  it  becomes  a 
popular  game.  Here  I  offer  an  overview  of  Dr.  Pratesi’ s  thesis: 

And  what  can  be  told  about  the  draughts  game? 

I  am  silent  on  the  question  of  the  origin  or  the  French  original  name 
that  could  mean  in  an  early  stage  “game  played  by  women  of  the 
aristocratic  class”.  For  me  the  social  distribution  is  important. 
According  to  the  common  view  the  game  remained  mainly  restricted 
to  the  lower  classes,  but  that  view  is  surely  a  thing  to  nuance.  Just  as 
other  games  that  require  a  high  skill,  one  cannot  play  the  game  on 
high  level  without  much  experience.  Successful  game  playing 
requires,  in  addition  to  exercise,  a  natural  aptitude  and  also  the  study 
of  the  theory:  a  player  must  analyze  parties  and  study  opening 
variants.  It  requires  that  someone  possesses  enough  free  time,  and  is 
able  to  teach  himself  the  things  or  can  learn  from  a  book  or  take 
lessons  from  a  draughts  master  -  exactly  the  matters  that  make  up  the 
education  of  people  from  the  better  classes.  Therefore,  only  the  better- 
off  could  easily  increase  their  knowledge  of  the  game.  And  so,  as  I 
suggest,  we  can  expect  top  players  in  the  past,  resulting  from  the 
leading  social  classes:  nobles,  representatives  of  the  Church,  army 
officers  and  merchants. 

It  is  intriguing  here  to  know  the  opinion  of  one  of  the  first 
draughts  historians  in  Holland,  in  this  case  the  Engineer  Gerard 
Bakker,  who  had  in  the  past  various  discussions  with  Van  der 
Stoep,  and  indicate  here  what  he  stated  about  the  origin  of  the

Draughts  game15  in  the  Dutch  Draughts  Magazine  “De 
Problemist ”  in  2000. 

About  the  origin  of  the  draughts  game 

In  a  foreword  and  introduction  of  [the  book]  Dammen  zonder 
dammen  en  Dame  blanche  I  have  (in  both  cases  with  some  words) 
indicated  a  connection  between  (the  titles  of)  these  books  and  the  first 
historical  draughts  game  such  as  that  it  must  have  occurred  around 
1500  in  Spain.  It  is  known  to  me  that  Arie  van  der  Stoep  graduated 
with  a  doctoral  thesis  with  the  title  About  the  Origin  of  the  Word 
Draughts  Game  and  it  has  not  escaped  me  that  he  believes  (and  now 
writes  literally)  that  with  that  work  he  has  uncovered  the  origin  of  the 
draughts  game.  If  the  language  facts  of  Arie  van  der  Stoep  points 
toward  a  prehistoric  draughts  game,  of  which  the  board,  pieces,  game, 
and  players  are  still  to  be  discovered,  then  I  take  note  of  this 
information.  I  am  of  the  opinion  that  history  cannot  be  reduced  to 
language. 

However,  Bakker  is  not  the  only  historian  who  has 
discrepancies  with  Van  der  Stoep.  Jean  Michel  Mehl  (1946)  is 
an  expert  in  the  medieval  history  and  the  games.  He  graduated 
in  1988  in  Paris  precisely  on  the  games  played  in  France.  One 
thing  is  clear  for  Mehl16:  the  draughts  game  was  unknown  in 
France  in  medieval  times  and  his  final  words  about  draughts  in 
France  are  disastrous  for  Van  der  Stoep ’s  vision: 

Meme  si  le  jeu  de  dames  a  existe,  il  n’a  connu  aucune  popularity 
avante  le  XVIe  siecle. 

Translation: 

Even  if  the  draughts  game  had  existed,  it  had  not  experienced 
popularity  before  the  sixteenth  century.

In  France  there  existed  a  checkered  board  of  36  squares  (18 
blacks  and  18  whites),  but  this  game  has  nothing  to  do  with 
draughts.  The  gameboards  specialist  Murray  says:  “Five 
mentions  of  draughts  between  1200  and  1400  do  not  point  to 
any  great  popularity  in  the  Middle  Ages17”.  The  draughts 
historian  Kruijswijk  says:  “that  it  did  not  produce  more  traces 
than  a  scarce  number  of  references  must  mean  that  the  game  did 
not  belong  to  the  leading  board  games18. 

The  draughts  historian  Gerard  Bakker  cannot  accept  Van  der 
Stoep's19various  theories  either.  For  Van  der  Stoep  any 
checkered  board  in  France  with  pieces  is  immediately  baptized 
as  a  draughts  game.  However,  my  theorem  is  that  checkered 
boards  with  different  sizes  from  the  chessboard  before  1495 
cannot  be  considered  a  draughts  game.  The  draughts  game  is  a 
continuation  of  Alquerque-12.  Consequently,  people  played  it  in 
the  beginning  with  12  pieces.  For  that  reason  when  I  see  a 
checkered  board  in  Spain  with  fewer  squares  than  a  chessboard 
and  from  earlier  than  1495, 1  do  not  believe  it  to  be  a  draughts 
game.  Two  examples  are  an  altar  painting  from  the  14th 
century20  found  in  the  Museum  of  Mallorca  (Spain)  and  the 
checkered  boards  found  near  the  Roman  Theatre  of  Merida. 
Here  they  follow.

Many  archaeologists  often  speak  of  the  alquerque  game  and 
then  confuse  the  game  of  alquerque  9  with  Alquerque- 12.  To 
distinguish  the  game  one  cannot  use  only  the  name  "alquerque", 
but  it  is  necessary  to  add  a  number  to  the  game.  Thus  Alquerque 
3,  Alquerque  9,  or  Alquerque-12.  Alquerque  9  uses  a  board 
known  as  the  Nine  Men's  Morris.  This  board  sometimes  bears 
12  pieces.  One  cannot  suffice  to  mention  only  the  game  as 
Alquerque-12  because  here  it  is  necessary  to  state  the  word  mill 
or  publish  the  corresponding  board.  This  way  one  avoids 
confusion  with  Alquerque-12  described  in  the  book  of  King 
Alfonso  The  Wise,  in  1283. 

Both  alquerque  3  and  alquerque  9  were  known  in  Roman  times. 
The  situation  is  completely  different  for  Alquerque-12.  It  is  said 
that  the  alquerque  has  its  origin  in  Egypt.  Perhaps  this  is  the 
case  for  alquerque  3  and  9,  but  never  for  Alquerque-12.  Some 
authors  claim  that  Alquerque-12  is  a  Greek  or  Roman  game,  but

However,  after  the  devastating  articles  by  several  historians 
about  Egypt  and  Greece  Dr.  Van  der  Stoep  decided  in  2009  to 
change  his  view  of  the  history  of  draughts  and  suddenly  stated 
that  the  Egyptians  and  Greeks  never  had  played  draughts.  He 
ended  his  article  as  follows22: 

The  conclusion  should  be  that  supposedly  draughts  was  known 

neither  in  ancient  Egypt,  nor  in  ancient  Greece,  nor  in  ancient  Rome. 

But  there  are  some  uncertainties. 

It  is  true  that  the  Roman  Empire  took  over  the  Greek  games,  but 
Alquerque-12  did  not  belong  to  the  Greek  games.  The  games 
Ludus  Latrunculorum,  Duodecim  Scruporum  and  Penta 
grammai  are  described  in  my  books,  but  I  consider  Dr.  Ulrich 
Schadler  to  be  the  best  boardgames  expert  for  the  rules  of  these 
games.  Van  der  Stoep  thought  that  Scaevola  with  his  Ludus 
Duodecim  was  a  draughts  player,  but  again  we  have  to  refer  to 
Dr.  Ulrich  Schadler  who  showed  that  this  is  a  tric-trac  game23. 

Being  aware  of  the  fact  that  to  this  day  there  still  exists  some 
confusion  about  the  Alquerque-12  game  I  have  concentrated 
this  time  on  the  history  of  this  board  game.  Again  we  see  that 
Spain  has  an  important  history  of  this  game  too.  For  that  reason 
I  explain  in  this  book  the  history  of  Alquerque-12  together  with 
notes  on  the  draughts  game  in  order  to  contradict  Murray.  It  is 
quite  clear  that  there  are  still  some  historians  who  do  not  believe 
in  Isabelle  of  Castile  and  I  am  quite  sure  that  the  same  will 
happen  with  my  history  of  Alquerque-12.  On  the  other  hand  I 
am  also  quite  sure  that  there  will  be  other  historians  who  will 
ameliorate  my  points  of  view  and  that  in  future  I  will  undergo

the  same  fate  as  Murray.  However,  this  is  the  consequence  of 
research,  where  we  all  are  interested  in  seeing  the  full  truth  at 
the  end. 


The  Spanish  history  of  Alquerque-12  is  so 
important  that  it  is  worthwhile  to  have 
some  books  written  about  this  game.  First 
of  all  I  will  briefly  discuss  the  Egyptian, 
Greek,  and  Roman  games  and  then 
thoroughly  the  game  of  Alquerque-12.

2  THE  ANCIENT  EGYPTIAN 
GAMES 

Ancient  Egyptian  game  boxes  were  often  qualified24  as 
draughts,  because  there  was  a  board  with  squares  and  uniform 
pieces.  As  a  result  of  that  terms  like  “Jeu  de  Dames”  and 
“Draughts”  were  used  incorrectly.

in  Nigeria32. 


2.1  The  erroneous  date  of  Murray. 

Today  all  historians  and  archaeologists  are  following  Murray33, 
and  state  that  the  alquerque  game  is  original  to  Egypt  in  the  14th 
and  13th  century  B.C.,  because  they  have  found  boards  carved 
in  the  blocks  of  stone  that  form  the  roof  of  the  great  temple  in 
Kurna,  Egypt.  I  have  already  explained  in  my  book  of  2004  that 
I  did  not  believe  in  the  fact  that  the  Draughts  were  played  in

Ulrich  Schadler,  the  famous  boardgame  specialist  of  the  Roman

researchers  where  to  obtain  a  photo  of  the  presumed  alquerque 
12  drawing  of  Kuma,  as  well  as  having  a  scientific  opinion 
from  the  Egyptologists37. 

The  studies  of  Wim  van  Mourik  in  Het  Damspel  and  Robert

Charles  Bell  ,  and  Ulrich  Schadler  are  sufficient  to  prove  that 
there  was  no  draughts  game  at  the  time  of  the  Pharaohs  in

had  nothing  to  do  with  Alquerque-12  and  draughts40.

Stone  from  Gisa  (British  Museum,  London)  ? 
According  to  Marco  Fitta  (167,  nr.  277) 


The  Dutch  draughts  historian  Wim  van  Mourik  critically 
analysed  the  book  of  Marco  Fitta41  and  what  now  follows  is  a 
summary  of  his  article42  in  a  Dutch  draughts  magazine: 

If  we  are  to  believe  Fitta,  the  Alquerque-12  game  board  that  we  see 
on  a  stone  here  comes  from  Gisa  (Gizeh),  Egypt,  at  the  time  of 
Ramses  I  and  the  game  is  similar  to  our  draughts  game.  However,  as 
vagueness,  ignorance,  or  deceits  come  into  sight,  the  writer  is  losing 
credibility.  Fitta  states  that  the  British  Museum  in  London  is  the

this  stone  have  to  travel  to  London  to  convince  themselves  about  the 
stone.  However,  those  who  are  actually  interested  in  seeing  the  stone 
would  do  better  to  make  a  trip  to  the  German  Xanten.

When  Van  Mourik  saw  the  book  of  Dr.  Anita  Rieche43  he 
quickly  came  to  the  conclusion  that  Fitta  printed  a  mirror  image 
of  a  baked  tile  (tegula)  from  Roman  times  found  in  the  Ulpia 
Traiana  Colonia  (Xanten)  in  insula  27.  Dr.  Rieche  is  very 
careful  with  her  opinion  when  she  says  that  the  rapidly  incised

lines  possibly  display  a  board  game  of  Ludus  Latrunculorum. 
The  diagonals  would  not  have  a  specific  meaning  at  all. 


Draughts  historian  Wim  van  Mourik 

Thanks  to  the  collaboration  of  Andrea  Bussmann  commissioned 
by  Dr.  Ana  Riech,  Rheinisches  Landesmuseum  Bonn  and 
Edeltraud  Mittag,  Archaelologscher  Park  /  Regionalmuseum 
Xanten,  we  can  here  observe  the  mirror  image  of  the  presumed 
Gisa  stone. 

It  is  also  clear  here  that  we  can  forget  that  Alquerque-12  had 
been  played  in  the  Egyptian  time.  Fables  and  fairy  tales 
continue  to  exist  about  the  origin  of  the  draughts  game.

3  THE  ANCIENT  GREEK  GAMES 


The  ancient  Greek  games  were  described  by  the  contemporaries 
Pollux44  and  Suetonius45.  The  game  diagrammismos  (grammai) 
appears  to  be  the  same  as  the  Roman  board  game  duodecim

century  BC,  is  from  the  Etruscan  culture,  and  is  still  visible  in

soldiers  are  playing  five  lines  (pente  grammai),  as  can  be  seen 
from  the  depiction  of  the  gaming  board  on  a  vase  in  the  museum 
in  Brussels.  Murray  states  that  the  game  petteia  (polis)  is 

AO 

nothing  else  than  the  Roman  game  Ludus  Latrunculorum  . 
However,  petteia  is  not  the  name  of  a  game  but  a  generic  Greek 
term  indicating  “board  game”  that  derives  from  the  word  pessos 
=  stone,  gaming  piece.  Hesychius  speaks  about  diagrammismos, 
a  game  with  60  stones,  which  Eustathius  confirms  in  the  12th 
century,  but  Murray49  believed  more  in  an  error  on  the  part  of 
Hesychius.

"Terracotta  Group" 

The  game  of  polis  is  described  by  Pollux50  and  appears  to  be  a 
game  on  a  grid  with  uniform  pieces  called  dogs,  and  this  game 
was  the  earlier  Greek  version  of  the  Roman  latrunculi.  The 
intention  is  to  block  the  enemy  pieces  and  capture  them  by

trapping.  Also  in  the  Seega  game51  there  are  pieces  called  dogs 
(kelb,  pi.  Kilab). 


Little  game  material  has  been  found  in  Greece.  The  earlier 
indicated  drawing  of  the  Athenian  terracotta  group  appears  in 
Richter52  and  was  first  described  by  Bursian53.  It  is  further 
discussed  by  Michaelis54  and  Bliimner55.  Other  authors  who 
wrote  about  the  Greek  games  were  Coleridge56,  Dumont57, 
Becker58,  Andre59,  Severino60,  Meurs61,  Wayte62,  and  Lafaye63.

4  THE  ANCIENT  ROMAN  GAMES 


Generally  speaking  the  Romans  knew  four  board  games, 
namely  Alea64,  Ludus  Duodecim  Scripta,  Ludus  Latrunculorum, 
and  a  game  without  a  name  described  by  the  poet  Ovid,  but  the 
game  had  to  do  with  the  little  mill. 


4.1  Duodecim  Scripta 

Some  knowledge  of  the  games  from  Roman  times  is  important 
to  us,  because  it  happens  too  often  that  a  Roman  board  game  is 
mistaken  for  a  draughts  game  and  that  is  not  correct.  On  the 
other  hand  we  see  appear  on  the  Internet  nice  irresponsible 
inventions  of  other  presumed  Roman  games  and  in  this  case  I 
prefer  to  follow  the  board  game  specialist  in  Greek  and  Roman 
Games  Dr.  Ulrich  Schadler: 

What  is  written  about  the  board  games  XII  scripta ,  the  presumed 
game  tabula ,  and  a  game  the  author  calls  “felix  sex”  which  has  never 
existed  is  a  completely  misleading  invention  of  the  author  without  any 
idea  of  what  serious  research  into  Roman  board  games  has  brought  to 
light65.  The  boards  of  the  game  the  author  calls  “felix  sex”  are  simply 
boards  for  XII  scripta  and  alea. 

The  reconstruction  of  ancient  games  is  a  very  complicated 
subject  where  archaeological  evidence,  literary  sources  in  Greek 


64  CARDANO,  Girolamo  (1663)  Liber  de  ludo  Aleae.  Lugduni 

65  See  in  this  case  the  important  studies:

and  Latin,  and  knowledge  of  general  mechanisms  of  board 
games  must  be  combined.  It  is  not  enough  to  study  the  English 
books,  because  other  relevant  studies  should  also  be  taken  into 
account66. 

So  Caro67  observes  that  San  Isidoro68  already  distinguishes  two 
types  of  pieces;  those  of  the  damas  (Kings,  Queens)  as  Vagues 
(vagi)  and  those  of  the  pawns  as  Ordinaries  (ordinarii).  Caro  is 
wrong  here,  because  San  Isidoro’s  reference  to  the  pieces  has 
nothing  to  do  with  draughts.  The  conscious  text  of  San  Isidoro 
has  to  do  with  the  Duodecim  Scripta  and  the  related  Alea 
game69.  Avigliano  made  the  same  mistake  centuries  later70. 


4.2  Ludiis  Latrunculorum  (Latrunculi). 

The  game  of  Ludus  Latrunculorum,  also  called  Latrunculi,  is  of 
importance  to  us.  Some  authors,  such  as  Hyde71,  considered  this 
erroneously  to  be  a  draughts  game.  Caylus  claims  that  the 
Romans  played  on  a  board  with  alternating  white  and  black

squares,  which  was  accepted  by  Becq  de  Fouquieres  .  This  is 
not  correct  since  in  ancient  Rome  the  checkering  of  game 
boards  was  unknown. 

According  to  Murray74  Latrunculi  has  nothing  to  do  with 
draughts.  Gortmans75  already  came  to  this  conclusion  in  his 
articles. 


Draughts  historian  Godefridus  Laurentius  Gortmans 
(1894-1956) 

Several  attempts  to  reach  a  clear  gameplay  for  the  Ludus 
Latrunculorum  had  been  undertaken  by  Becq  de  Fouquieres76, 
Falkener77,  Murray78,  Bell79,  Schmitt80,  and  lately  Schadler81.

The  first  trace  to  Ludus  Latrunculorum  leads  to  Marcus 
Terentius  Varro  (116-27  BC).  The  rules  are  incompletely 
represented  by  Ovid,  Martial,  Seneca  and  the  author  of  the 
poem  Laus  Pisonis.  Roma  Ludens  describes  which  famous 
Romans  practiced  the  board  game. 


Rules  of  Ludus  Latrunculorum

Here  are  some  incomplete  rules  on  the  basis  of  what  Bakker 
wrote  in  the  Vacature  and  of  which  the  texts  also  were  a  matter 
of  study  by  Hyde84. 

Publius  Ovidius  Naso  (Ovide,  Ars  Amatorio  III,  357/360): 

Cautaque,  non  stulte,  latronum  proelia  ludat,  unus  cum  gemino 
calculus  hoste  perit,  bellatorque  sua  prensus  sine  compare  bellat, 
aemulus  et  coeptum  saepe  recurrit  iter.

Play  not  imprudently  in  the  artful  combat  of  the  Little  Robbers,  an 
isolated  soldier  must  perish  if  he  attacks  two  enemies  at  once.  And  a 
warrior  wars  without  his  companion  who’s  been  taken,  and  a  rival 
often  has  to  return  the  way  he  began. 

Publius  Ovidius  Naso  (Ovide,  Tristia  2,  477-480): 

...discolor  ut  recto  grassetur  limite  miles,  cum  medius  gemino

. . .  your  soldiers,  of  different  colors,  must  follow  closely  the  straight 
line,  and  when  there  is  a  risk  of  losing  a  piece  trapped  between  two 
enemies,  the  art  is  to  support  the  first  piece  and  to  ensure  that  his 
retirement  could  be  done  safely  and  accompanied. 

One  can  move  the  pieces  forward  and  backward.  A  piece  too  far 
advanced  can  return  with  the  help  of  another  own  piece. 


Marcus  Valerius  Martialis 

Marcus  Valerius  Martialis:  (Martialis,  Epigrammata  14-17,  2):

On  one  side  (of  the  board)  the  dices  give  me  double  sixes;  on  the

In  an  anonymous  poem  that  survives  under  the  name  of  Laus 
Pisonis  the  party  game  of  the  Roman  statesman  Gaius 
Calpurnius  was  mentioned85: 

Te  si  forte  iuvat  studiorum  pondere  fessum,  non  languere  tamen, 
lususque  movere  per  artem:  callidiore  modo  tabula  variatur  aperta 
calculus,  et  vitreo  peraguntur  milite  bella:  ut  niveus  nigros,  nunc  et 
niger  alliget  albos. 

Translation: 

If  you  please  sometimes,  when  weary  with  the  weight  of  studies,  to  be 
nevertheless  not  inactive  but  to  play  games  of  skill,  then  on  the  open 
board  in  more  cunning  fashion  a  piece  is  moved  into  different 
positions  and  the  war  is  waged  to  a  finish  with  glass  soldiers,  so  that 
white  blocks  the  black  pieces,  and  black  blocks  the  white. 

Gladys  Martin  even  wrote  a  thesis  on  Laus  Pisonis86  stating  that  the 
date  of  this  poem  can  clearly  be  no  later  than  65  A.D. 

Sed  tibi  quis  non  terga  dedit?  quis  te  duce  cessit  calculus?  aut  quis

But  what  player  has  not  retreated  before  you?  Or  what  piece  before 
capture  has  not  reduced  the  enemy?  In  a  thousand  ways  your  army 
fights:  one  piece,  as  it  retreats,  itself  captures  its  pursuer:  a  reserve 
piece,  standing  on  the  alert,  comes  from  its  distant  retreat-  this  one 
dares  to  join  the  fray  and  cheats  the  enemy  coming  for  his  spoil. 
Another  piece  submits  to  risky  delays  and,  seemingly  checked,  itself 
checks  two  more:  this  one  moves  towards  higher  results,  so  that, 
quickly  played  and  breaking  the  opponent’s  defensive  line,  it  may 
burst  out  on  his  forces  and,  when  the  rampart  is  down,  devastate  the 
enclosed  city.  Meanwhile,  however  fierce  rises  the  conflict  among  the 
men  in  their  divided  ranks,  still  you  win  with  your  phalanx  intact  or 
deprived  of  only  a  few  men,  and  both  your  hands  rattle  with  the 
crowd  of  pieces  you  have  taken. 

We  observe  that  white  and  black  glass  pieces  are  used.  Captured 
pieces  are  removed  from  the  board  and  the  pieces  should  be 
kept  together  in  lines.  With  regards  to  the  other  rules  of  the 
game  we  know  that  archaeological  research  has  confirmed  that 
uniform  pieces  were  used88  and  a  surrounded  piece  could  not  be 
removed  immediately  from  the  board  .  The  pieces  are  brought

one  by  one  on  the  board90  and  the  game  Ludus  Latrunculorum  is 
quite  similar  to  the  Seega  game91.  The  game  was  played  by  two 
people  on  a  board  on  which  lines  were  drawn  to  obtain  a  certain 
number  of  playing  fields.  Further  archaeological  research  has 
shown  that  the  game  was  not  played  with  an  exact  number  of 
squares.  Boards  were  found92  that  had  7x7,  7x8,  8x8,  9x9,  9x10, 
and  even  fields  of  10x13. 

The  game  of  Ludus  Latrunculorum  has  been  discussed  in  the 
works  of  Anonymous93,  Mommeian94,  Clerc95,  Averani96,  and

Q7  qq 

Tilley  .  Hieronymus  (Girolanus)  Cardanus  ,  also  called 
Cardan  or  Cardano,  wrote  a  book  using  the  title  The  Ludus 
Latrunculorum,  but  this  work  has  been  lost".  This  famous 
Italian  scholar  was  so  addicted  to  the  game  that  at  some  point  in 
his  life  he  had  to  sell  all  furniture  and  his  wife’s  jewelry. 


Games  derivative  of  Ludus  Latronculorum 

It  is  generally  accepted  that  the  game  of  Ludus  Latrunculorum 
is  known  nowhere  and  extinct.  But  this  seems  a  premature 
conclusion,  a  game  that  was  earlier  played  by  millions  of 
people  in  many  countries  cannot  just  die  without  leaving  a  trace. 
The  game  probably  still  exists  under  a  different  name  or  with 
slight  modifications  in  countries  where  a  traditional  culture 
reigns.  Various  games,  which  we  still  know  today,  emerged 
from  the  Roman  strategy  game.  The  course  and  the  capture 
were  derived  from  this  game.  Primitive  tribes  did  not  have 
boards  and  were  obliged  to  draw  lines  in  the  sand  with  sticks. 
This  becomes  clear  when  we  see  later  on  how  the  Bataks  draw 
their  chessboard.  Therefore  a  closer  look  at  the  games  that  had 
to  do  with  the  Roman  games  can  give  us  some  more 
information.  In  this  sense  we  are  very  grateful  to  Jansen  who 
sought  this  information  in  The  Royal  Netherlands  Institute  of 
Southeast  Asian  and  Caribbean  Studies  in  Leiden  and  in  the 
Library  of  the  Teyler  Museum  in  Haarlem.  Jansen  made  a  study 
of  six  games:

4.2.1  Papan  Chator 

PAPAN  CHATOR,  THE  SECRET  OF  THE  BATTAKS. 

In  the  second  half  of  the  19th  century  the  interior  of  Central  and 
North  Sumatra  was  still  terra  incognita.  A  single  Chinese  or 
Malay  trader  never  went  on  an  expedition.  The  Bataks  fully 
realized  the  threat  posed  by  the  Dutch  authorities  in  the  south 
and  refused  to  receive  the  Europeans  in  a  friendly  manner. 
Therefore  people  only  slowly  gained  knowledge  about  this 
people.  The  phenomenon  of  cannibalism  was  not  uncommon  in 
these  parts,  but  on  the  other  hand  the  writing  already  was  very 
well  known  (historical  narratives  which  were  written  on  the  tree 
bark  and  stores  in  tubes). 

In  1904  appeared  a  remarkable  book  written  by  Armin  von 
Oefele  about  another  aspect  of  life  there.  The  German 
ethnologist  expressed  his  surprise  over  the  fact 
that  nature  people  practiced  a  culture  game.  In  1930  Max  Euwe 
encountered  at  first  hand  during  his  Indian  tour  how  strong  the 
Bataks  were  at  playing  chess.  He  had  to  allow  many  draws.

board  for  the  Mill  game.  (Three  men’s  Morris  or  Tic-tac-toe) 
Schliemann104  found  this  drawing  in  the  ruins  of  Troya. 

At  least  2000  years’  history  is  becoming  visible  when  one  looks 
at  how  the  Bataks  drew  their  chessboard. 

(Von  Oefele105):  “Die  64  Felder  des  Spielplanes  sind  bei  den 
Batakern  nicht  der  Farbe  nach  unterschieden  sondem  mit  Hilfe  von 
Linien  in  ein  Bret  eingeritzt.  Durch  jedes  Feld  ziehen  zich  2 
Diagonalen,  deren  Bedeutung  unbekannt  bleibt,  wenn  man  nicht 
zugesehen  hat,  wie  der  Bataker  sein  Brett  herstellt.  Er  macht  dies 
namlich  auf  regelrecht  mathematischen  Wege.  Zuerst  errichtet  er  das 
Quadrat,  dat  die  Felder  enthalten  soil.  In  diesem  zieht  er  die 
Diagonalen,  worauf  in  deren  Schnittpunkten  die  beiden  Hohen  gefallt 
werden,  so  dass  nun  das  grosze  Quadrat  in  4  gleiche  Quadrate  geteilt 
ist.  Diese  4  Quadrate  teilt  er  hierauf  einzeln  auf  dieselbe  Weise 
wieder  in  4  kleinere.  Damit  zeigt  das  Brett  schon  16  Quadrate.  Die 
Vierteilung  fmdet  nun  noch  einmal  statt,  womit  die  Zahl  64  erreicht 
ist.  Der  Symmetric  halber  werden  die  Diagonalen  durchgezogen. 
(Schachbrett  =  Papan  Chator)”. 

Translation: 

The  64  spaces  of  the  game  plan  of  the  Bataks  are  not  coloured,  but 
distinguished  by  using  lines  on  a  board.  Through  each  field  they  draw 
two  diagonals,  of  which  the  significance  remains  unknown,  if  you  are 
not  watching  how  the  Batak  manufactures  his  board.  He  does  this  in 
fact  in  a  downright  mathematical  way.  First  he  builds  the  square  that 
should  include  the  fields.  In  in  he  draws  the  diagonals,  which  are 
taken  at  the  intersections  of  the  two  heights,  so  that  now  the  large 
square  has  been  divided  into  4  equal  squares.  Then  he  shares  these 
four  squares  individually  on  the  same  way  again  into  4  smaller  ones.

In  this  way  the  board  now  shows  16  squares.  The  fourfold  division  is 
now  taking  place  again,  bringing  the  number  to  64.  For  the  sake  of 
symmetry  the  diagonals  are  drawn.  (Checkerboard  =  Papan  Chator).

Board  Phase  5:  for  playing  alquerque  with  40  pieces.  (The 
neighbours  of  the  Bataks,  the  Achinese,  play  the  tiger  game 
with  40  tigers  on  this  board).

among  the  Roman  finds  of  game  boards  in  England106.  There

4.2.2  ApitSodok 

APIT  SODOK,  A  ROMAN  BOARD  GAME? 

According  Samusah109,  this  Malay  game  is  played  as  follows: 


This  game  is  played  on  a  draughtsboard  by  2  players.  There  are 
16  pieces,  all  of  equal  value,  and  these  are  arranged  in  2  rows  as 
in  chess.  Pieces  can  be  moved  backwards,  forwards,  and 
sideways  (but  not  diagonally)  as  many  squares  as  are  required, 
players  move  the  opponent’s  pieces  sodo.  (moving  away). This 
can  be  done: 

a.  by  sodo 

b.  by  apit. 

a.  SODO.  If  2  pieces,  say  of  white,  are  in  the  same  straight  line 
with  an  empty  place  between  them,  a  black  can  move  a  piece  on 
to  the  empty  square  and  remove  the  white  pieces  on  either  side.

In  figure  I  if  B  moves  to  either  place  marked  x,  he  can  remove 
the  2  white  pieces. 

b.  APIT.  If  one  or  more  pieces  are  enclosed  by  an  opponent’s 
pieces,  one  opponent’s  piece  on  either  side  whether  from  front 
and  back,  or  right  and  left,  the  piece  or  pieces  can  be  removed. 
In  figure  II  and  III  (1):  if  B  moves  his  piece  to  either  square 
marked  x,  the  white  piece  or  pieces  can  be  taken. 


Ill  (a)  IV  (a) 


III  (b)  IV  (b) 

If  the  pieces  are  deliberately  placed  in  the  position  of  apit  by 
one  side,  the  other  side  cannot  take  it  from  them  until  one  of  the 
enclosing  pieces  has  been  moved.  In  IV  (b):  if  W.  moves  to  the 
square  marked  x,  B.  cannot  remove  the  pieces  until  one  of  the 
B.  enclosing  pieces  has  been  moved  away  and  back.  Pieces  can 
be  removed  by  sodo  and  by  apit  if  the  arrangement  of  the 
enemy’s  pieces  permits  as  in  fig.  IV  (a).  A  piece  enclosed  in  a 
comer  as  W.  in  fig.  Ill  (b)  cannot  be  taken. 

Wilkinson110,  Kool111,  and  Hervey112  wrote  about  this  game, 
too.

This  is  a  mind  game,  where,  by 
shifting  of  the  own  pieces,  one 
always  attempts  to  create  a 
situation,  where  the  opponent  in 
the  side  can  be  attacked,  in  order 
to  capture  per  shift  the  maximum 
number  of  pieces. 

Draw  to  begin  64  squares  (as  in 
the  drawing).  Both  players  use 
16  pieces  each. 


In  order  to  easily  distinguish  the  pieces  different  colors  are 
used.  The  pieces  on  the  sides  of  the  players  are  put  on  the 
squares.  After  each  game  the  colors  of  the  players  are  changed. 

The  moves:  shift  straight  across  the  squares,  forward,  backward, 
left  or  right.  Each  move  may  have  a  length  of  more  than  one 
square.  The  exact  number  of  squares  is  not  important  (but  there 
should  not  be  other  pieces  on  those  squares). 

The  capture:  There  are  3  ways,  saturated  capture, 
unsaturated  capture,  and  color-changing  capture.  This

depends  on  the  agreements  that  the  players  have  made  at  the 
beginning  of  the  game. 

Saturated  capture  means  that  during  the  turn  of  capture  all 
pieces  might  be  captured  that  can  be  captured  in  a  path  that  the 
opponent  has  opened,  (in  other  words,  several  consecutive 
captures).

Unsaturated  capture  means  that  one  can  capture  only  one 
time,  and  then  one  has  to  wait  until  the  enemy  has  moved  a 
piece  before  one  can  make  a  move  again  or  can  effect  another 
capture.

Color-changing  capture  means  that  if  the  opponent’s  pieces 
are  captured,  those  captured  pieces  should  be  replaced  by  pieces 
of  the  player  whose  turn  it  is  (put  the  replaced  pieces  in  the 
place  of  the  old  pieces).

Examples:  Shift  or  move  the  black  piece  from  bottom  to  top  to 
the  square  indicated  by  the  arrow.  On  all  3  sides  the  white 
pieces  are  then  captured.  The  three  white  pieces,  flanked  by  the 
black  piece  are  still  to  be  removed.  (Consequently  the  black 
piece  captures  6  white  pieces).  Low113  also  wrote  about  this 
game.

4.2.4  Gala 


Especially  in  the  period  in  which  the  draughts  in  the 
Netherlands  came  under  renewed  interest  the  Dutch  Bible 
Society  (Nederlandsch  Bijbelgenootschap)  sent  out  linguists 
to  the  outlying  areas  of  Dutch  East  Indies  to  compile  diction¬ 
aries  for  the  different  regions  with  a  view  of  preparation  of 
Bible  translations.  Precisely  these  glossaries  focus  on  draughts. 
Dr.  Benjamin  Frederick  Matthes  in  his  great  dictionaries  of 
Buginese114  and  Makassar115  gave  a  very  detailed  description  of 
a  board  game  form  in  South  Sulawesi. 

The  Gala  game  described  therein  seems  to  have  affinities  with 
the  Roman  Ludus  Latrunculorum  in  the  way  of  capturing. 

On  the  other  hand  the  inequality  in  numbers  of  pieces  of  the  two 
parties  and  the  granting  of  the  central  place  of  the  board  to  the 
party  with  the  least  number  of  pieces  points  in  the  direction  of  a 
German  board  game  of  Roman  origin  (hnefatafl).  Given  that 
the  gala  game  even  provides  a  proverb  in  Buginese  it  is  very 
well  conceivable  that  this  game  is  still  played  in  South  Sulawesi 
and  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  a  further  report  from  an 
eyewitness  will  be  done.  Also  Eck116  and  again  Matthes117 
discussed  the  gala  game.

The  Gala  game  is  played  as  follows.  This  game  is  like  checkers 
or  draughts,  played  by  two  persons  on  a  board  with  49  squares, 
of  which  9  squares  have  a  cross  marked  (soelangka).  There  are 
4  corner  squares  (soe)  and  there  is  one  central  square  (posi). 
This  game  uses  10  black  and  13  white  pieces.  The  pieces  move 
in  a  straight  line  and  never  move  on  a  crossing  or  diagonally. 
Capture  also  takes  place  in  this  game,  but  in  a  completely 
different  way  from  that  in  draughts. 

When  a  piece  (batoe)  arrives  between 
two  pieces  of  the  other  party,  or  a 
piece  standing  on  a  corner  of  the 
board  has  an  enemy  piece  on  both 
sides,  and  this  happened  not  because 
of  the  primitive  setting,  but  as  a  result 
of  shifting  the  pieces,  then  the  piece 
in  question  is  captured. 


On  the  contrary  the  piece  cannot  be  taken  when  it  comes 
between  two  pieces  of  the  other  party’s  during  setup  of  the 
pieces.  Then  at  first  one  is  obliged  to  shift  away  one  of  the  two 
pieces  and  thereafter  the  piece  can  move  back  to  the  same  place. 
This  type  of  moving  away  is  called  lese  (=  soro  =  shifting 
away).  During  setup  (Buginese:  dako  =  taro)  of  the  pieces  the 
black  pieces  should  start  the  game  by  putting  one  of  their  pieces 
on  the  central  square.  One  initially  puts  all  its  pieces  on  one  side 
of  the  board  and  then  one  moves  its  pieces  to  the  other  side  of 
the  board.  This  is  called  menre.  He  who  has  the  black  pieces 
must  endeavour  to  place  them  on  the  other  half  of  the  board 
pole  galana  (battie  mi-nai)  in  order  to  win  the  game.  The  task 
of  the  one  who  plays  with  the  white  pieces  is  to  prevent  this 
(that  is  called  bitje)  in  order  to  win  the  game.  Pole  is  a  situation

of  the  game  when  somebody  is  able  to  set  the  black  pieces  in 
such  a  way  that  it  is  blocking  the  enemy  pieces,  whereas  he  still 
can  move  one  of  its  own  pieces  without  giving  the  enemy  the 
opportunity  to  capture  his  black  pieces.  Four  pieces  is  the  least 
number  of  pieces  with  which  you  get  pole  and  this  is  then  in  the 
comer.  When  somebody  is  blocking  the  enemy  with  his  black 
pieces  in  such  a  way  that  he  cannot  move  himself  without 
giving  the  enemy  the  opportunity  to  capture  his  black  pieces, 
this  is  then  called  doetje,  which  is  double  smart  when  the 
enemy  is  blocking  the  black  pieces  (rilewo).  People  try  to  avoid 
in  this  game  the  position  of  his  pieces,  called  tjappa-keroe, 
because  than  the  enemy  can  capture  them  very  easily. 

Finally  I  will  speak  about  2  cases  of  which  one  is  called 
tangkoe,  and  the  other  one  tangkoe-lana.  In  the  case  of 
tangkoe  2  pieces  are  taken  and  in  the  case  tangkoe-Lana  3 
pieces  are  taken. 

This  game  has  a  metaphor  derived  from  the  following  elong: 
Marannoe  polegalana  /  Nagiling  tjappa-keroe/Naballeyang 
tangkoe.  He  already  rejoices  that  he  will  get  gala  game  pole 
get,  i.e.  winning  the  game,  but  he  shifts  his  pieces  in  a  manner 
that  he  creates  the  figure-tjappa  keroe,  whereby  he  gives  the 
enemy  advantage  and  finally  he  will  be  outwitted  by  the  figure 
called  tangkoe-Lana,  so  he  suddenly  loses  3  pieces 
consecutively  and  consequently  loses  all  hope  of  victory.  (If 
someone  wants  to  marry  a  slave,  but  is  not  alert  enough  and 
lingers  too  long,  then  he  will  see  that  his  Lord  will  snatch  his 
beloved  slave). 

Mapasiwoeno  gala  mabanni:  nocturnal  gala  fight,  night  gala 
play.  Gala  risoesang:  a  glass  ornament  that  one  lets  pend  here 
and  there,  a  reverse  gala  piece.  Pagala:  a  gala  player.  Nisikoki 
galaya:  Buginese  doetja:  in  the  gala  game  this  is  the  name  for

when  somebody  has  placed  the  black  pieces  in  such  a  manner 
that  the  enemy’s  white  pieces  are  blocked,  but  at  the  same  time 
does  not  have  the  opportunity  to  move  and  consequently  he  is 
thus  bound. 

Kaudern118  describes  this  as  a  backgammon  game,  but  Matthes 
does  not  speak  about  dice.  The  black  starts  the  game  first  and 
puts  a  piece  on  the  central  square.  The  other  pieces  are  placed 
one  by  one,  each  in  turn,  on  one's  own  half.

4.2.5  Tail  -  Hnefatafl 


The  age  of  this  game  is  estimated  by  Murray119  to  be  from  the 
1st  to  4th  century.  It  occurred  in  the  Nordic  countries  and  it  has 
today  been  virtually  superseded  by  chess.  It  was  a  board  game 
played  on  a  board  of  18x18  intersections  of  a  grid  with  13x11, 
11x11,  9x9,  and  7x7  squares.  The  game  is  played  by  two  people 
of  whom  one  has  a  King  on  the  central  square  of  the  board 
surrounded  by  a  bodyguard  of  an  equal  number  of  uniform 
symmetrical  pieces.  The  opponent  has  twice  as  many  uniform 
pieces,  which  in  four  equal  formations  are  distributed  uniformly 
over  the  central  squares  along  each  of  the  four  board  edges,  as 
shown  in  the  accompanying  drawing.

Initial  position  of  the  game  Tablut  (Tail,  Hnefatafl) 

All  pieces  have  a  common  orthogonal  movement  and  only  the 
King  may  occupy  the  central  square.  A  piece  that  cannot  free 
itself  from  the  clamping  of  two  enemy  pieces  is  captured.  The 
same  applies  to  a  piece  that  cannot  cancel  the  clamping  between 
two  enemy  pieces  and  the  central  square.  Even  in  the  case  when

the  central  square  is  taken  by  an  own  King.  De  King  is  captured 
by  blocking  of  4  enemy  attackers  or  3  enemy  pieces  on  the  edge 
of  the  board  and  by  leaving  the  central  square  which  means  loss 
of  the  game. 

Murray120  discovered  this  board  game,  of  which  the  famous 
Carl  Linnaeus121  noted  down  the  rules  in  a  travelogue  during  his 
stay  in  Lapland  where  the  game  was  known  under  the  name  of 
Tablut.  Tafl  was  the  older  name  for  this  game  in  Scandinavia 
that  was  later  called  Hnefatafl.  It  was  a  game  already  played  by 
the  Scandinavians.  The  game  existed  centuries  ago  in  England 
where  an  English  or  Irish  manuscript  was  known  about 
Hnefatafl  of  the  10th  century  that  had  been  translated  by 
Robinson  .  The  report  of  Linnaeus  is  the  last  known  reference 
to  the  living  Tablut  game.  After  1732  the  game  seems  to  be 
extinct  everywhere.  J.H.  Smith123  translated  the  diary  of 
Linnaeus's  of  mixed  Swedish  and  Latin  into  English  in  1811. 
Bakker  gave  us  the  following  rules  referring  to  Smith  in  the 
Vacture124  magazine. 

This  writer  starts  with  giving  a  drawing  of  the  board  and 
another  drawing  of  the  three  board  pieces,  saying  that  figure  1  is

the  king,  whose  station  is  on  the  central  square  or  royal  castle 
called  konokis  by  the  Laplanders,  to  which  no  other  person  can 
be  admitted.  Figure  2  represents  one  of  the  eight  Swedes  -  his 
subjects,  who  at  the  commencement  of  the  game  are  stationed  in 
the  eight  squares  adjoining  to  the  royal  castle,  marked  2  and  3. 
Figure  3  is  one  of  sixteen  Muscovites,  their  adversaries,  who 
occupy  the  sixteen  embroidered  squares  (some  of  them  marked 
4  in  the  cut),  situated  four  together  in  the  middle  of  each  side  of 
the  field.  The  vacant  squares,  distinguished  by  letters,  may  be 
occupied  by  any  of  the  pieces  in  the  course  of  the  game. 


With  respect  to  the  rules  of  the  game  Smith  goes  further  stating 
that: 

1 .  Any  piece  may  move  from  one  square  to  another  in  a  straight 
line,  as  from  a  to  c;  but  not  comerwise,  or  from  a  to  e. 

2.  It  is  not  allowed  to  pass  over  the  heads  of  any  other  pieces 
that  may  be  in  the  way,  or  to  move,  for  instance,  from  b  to  m,  in 
case  any  were  stationed  at  e  or  i. 

3.  If  the  King  should  stand  in  b  and  no  other  piece  in  e,  I,  or  m, 
he  may  escape  by  that  road,  unless  one  of  the  Muscovites 


-59- 


immediately  gets  possession  of  one  of  the  squares  in  question  so 
as  to  interrupt  him. 

4.  If  the  king  is  able  to  accomplish  this,  the  contest  is  at  its  end. 

5.  If  the  king  happens  to  be  in  e  and  none  of  his  own  people  or 
enemies  are  in  f,  g,  i,  or  m,  his  exit  cannot  be  prevented. 

6.  Whenever  the  person  who  moves  the  king  perceives  that  a 
passage  is  free,  he  must  call  our  raichi,  and  if  there  are  two 
open,  tuichu. 

7.  It  is  allowed  to  move  ever  so  far  at  once  in  a  straight  line  if 
the  squares  in  the  way  are  vacant,  as  from  c  to  n. 

8.  The  Swedes  and  the  Muscovites  take  it  in  turn  to  move. 

9.  If  any  one  man  gets  between  two  squares  occupied  by  his 
enemies,  he  is  killed  and  taken  off,  except  the  king,  who  is  not 
liable  to  this  misfortune. 

10.  If  the  king,  being  in  his  own  square  or  castle,  is 
encompassed  on  three  sides  by  his  enemies,  one  of  them 
standing  in  each  of  the  three  squares  numbered  2,  he  may  move 
away  by  the  fourth.  If  one  of  his  own  people  happens  to  be  in 
this  forth  square  and  one  of  his  enemies  in  number  3  next  to  it, 
the  soldier  thus  enclosed  between  his  king  and  the  enemy  is 
killed.  If  four  of  the  enemies  gain  possession  of  the  four  squares 
marked  2,  thus  enclosing  the  king,  he  becomes  their  prisoner. 

1 1 .  If  the  king  is  in  2  with  an  enemy  on  each  of  the  adjoining 
squares,  a,  A,  and  3,  he  is  taken. 

12.  Whenever  the  king  is  taken  or  imprisoned,  the  war  is  over, 
and  the  conqueror  seizes  all  the  Swedes,  the  conquered  party 
resigning  all  the  Muscovites  that  he  had  taken. 

Some  of  these  rules  of  Linnaeus  continue  being  confusing. 
Logically  speaking  several  other  authors  have  written  about  this

the  best  result  was  achieved  by  the  independent  scholar  John  C. 
Ashton,  who  interpreted  the  Latin  texts127  in  another  way.  So 
those  who  want  to  know  more  about  how  exactly  this  game  was 
played  have  to  take  into  account  the  large  study  of  Ashton.

4.2.6  Seega 


128  129 

Lane  described  the  Seega  game  that  was  popular  among 
the  fellaheen  in  the  19th  century.  Hundred  years  later,  Marin130 
rediscovered  the  same  game  (High  Jump)  played  by  the  Somali, 
but  the  capture  of  the  pieces  made  it  through  jump.  The  Seega 
board  is  drawn  on  the  ground  using  sticks,  until  obtaining  a 
board  of  5  x  5  squares.  Both  players131  have  the  same  number 
of  dogs  (kelb,  pi.  kilab).  The  following  rules  are  from  Bell  .

High  Jump 


As  we  see  in  the  drawing,  this  board  was  used  in  Spain  to  play 
orthogonally  the  Alquerque-12  game  too.  Since  it  is  logical  to 
suppose  that  the  game  of  High  Jump  of  the  Somalis  is  of  a  later 
date  than  the  one  of  the  Seega  game,  it  is  quite  well  possible

that  this  way  of  capture  of  the  Somalis  was  copied  from  the 
Spaniards. 


The  first  phase: 

1.  The  players  place  two  stones  at  a  time  on  any  vacant  squares 
except  the  centre  square  which  is  left  uncovered. 

2.  When  the  twenty-four  stones  have  been  placed,  the  player 
placing  the  last  couple  in  position  begins  the  second  phase. 


The  second  phase: 

3.  A  stone  can  move  orthogonally  to  any  adjacent  vacant  square, 
including  the  central  one. 

4.  If  a  player  can  trap  an  enemy  stone  between  two  of  his  own 
(the  custodian  capture),  he  removes  it  from  the  board  and 
continues  to  move  the  same  stone  as  long  as  he  makes  captures 
with  it.

Capture  in  Seega 

5.  A  stone  may  make  more  than  one  capture  in  a  single  move.  In 
the  figure  above  of  this  text  the  white  stone  captures  three  black 
ones  by  moving  on  to  the  centre  square. 

6.  A  player  can  move  a  stone  between  two  enemy  stones 
without  harm. 

7.  A  stone  on  the  centre  square  cannot  be  captured  even  though 
it  is  trapped  between  two  enemy  pieces. 

8.  When  a  player  cannot  move,  his  opponent  must  make  an 
opening  for  him  by  taking  an  extra  turn.

9.  The  boards  may  be  increased  to  7x7  or  9x9  squares,  each 
player  then  having  24  or  40  pieces. 

This  game  of  Seega  may  have  something  to  do  with  the  Pente

grammai  that  according  to  Pollux  would  exist  from  a  board  of 
5x5  squares  with  a  sacred  line.  According  to  Murray134  Pente 
grammai  is  nothing  else  than  the  current  Pentalpha.  Falkener135 
and  Parker136  wrote  about  this  game  too.

5  THE  LATIN  TERMS 

When  an  old  game  is  changing  to  a  new  one,  we  expect  to 
immediately  see  another  word  for  the  new  game.  However,  as 
we  will  see,  this  is  not  always  the  case.  For  some  years  people 
continue  using  the  name  of  the  old  game  for  the  new  one  and 
suddenly  they  realize  that  the  new  game  is  different  and  that 
consequently  there  should  be  another  name  for  the  new  one, 
since  the  way  of  playing  is  not  the  same  as  was  that  of  the  old 
game.  Since  draughts  is  nothing  else  than  a  continuation  of 
Alquerque-12,  but  now  played  on  a  checkered  board  and  with  a 
piece  called  dama  -  or  king  in  other  countries  -  there  was  in  the 
beginning  a  lot  of  confusion  among  historians  about  the  name  of 
draughts  and  jeu  de  dames.  In  this  context  of  gradual  transitions 
we  see  that  the  new  games  did  not  immediately  receive  new 
names,  which  led  to  a  lot  of  confusion  when  describing  old 
games  for  which  documentary  proofs  are  not  at  hand.  So  it  is 
quite  well  possible  that  games  like  draughts  and  marro  de  punta, 
originally  played  on  linesboard  and  thereafter  with  the 
introduction  of  the  chessboard  and  long  dama,  maintained  the 
name  of  draughts  and  marro  de  punta  for  some  years.  In  the 
case  of  draughts  (=  network)  we  still  see  this  name  and  marro  de 
punta  changed  to  the  Spanish  name  of  Juego  de  las  damas. 

Since  we  see  different  strong  pieces,  such  as  dama  and  king,  in 
the  new  game  of  draughts  on  the  checkered  board,  it  is  logical 
to  think  that  in  the  precursor  of  draughts  -  the  Alquerque-12 
line  game  -  there  was  also  a  stronger  piece  than  the  pawn  in  the 
game. 

What  was  the  Latin  literature  with  a  view  of  the  draughts  game 
in  Europe?  In  this  sense  we  observe  the  term  “Duodecim 
Scruporum”  or  “Scruporum  Duodecim”  in  the  European 


-65  - 


countries,  different  from  Spain  where  another  term  “Ludus 
Calculorum”  was  used  at  an  earlier  date.  So  I  will  amply 
describe  these  two  terms.  We  will  quickly  see  that  the  other 
countries  did  not  follow  Spain  with  its  term  of  “Ludus 
Calculorum”,  but  that  they  thought  that  the  right  Latin  term  for 
the  draughts  game  was  “Duodecim  Scruporum”  or  “Scruporum 
Duodecim”.  In  this  sense  we  will  see  that  the  Latin  term  “Ludus 
Calculorum”  was  used  at  the  beginning  of  the  16th  century  for 
Alquerque-12  and  Andarraya137  in  Spain  and  that  after  this 
period  this  Latin  term  was  used  for  the  draughts  game  on  a 
checkered  board. 

The  15th  and  16th  century  is  important  for  us  as  that  was  when 
Alquerque-12  was  changed  in  Spain  to  andarraya  and  draughts 
respectively.

5.1  Ludo  Duodecim  Scruporum 


5.1.1  Marcus  Tullius  Cicero 

Marcus  Tullius  Cicero  (106  BC  -  43  BC)  was  bom  in  106  BC 
in  Arpinum,  a  hill  town  100  kilometers  (62  miles)  southeast  of 
Rome.  He  was  a  Roman  philosopher,  statesman,  lawyer,  and 
political  theorist.  According  to  Plutarch,  Cicero  was  an 
extremely  talented  student  whose  learning  attracted  attention 
from  all  over  Rome,  affording  him  the  opportunity  to  study 
Roman  law  under  Quintus  Mucius  Scaevola,  a  statesman  and 
leader  of  the  senate.  His  opposition  to  Mark  Antony  was  finally 
the  cause  of  his  death. 


Marble  Bust  of  Marcus  Tullius  Cicero 

Widely  considered  as  one  of  Rome’s  greatest  orators  and  prose 
stylists,  Cicero  was  a  gifted  and  energetic  writer  with  an  interest 
in  a  wide  variety  of  subjects  in  keeping  with  the  Hellenistic 
philosophical  and  rhetorical  traditions  in  which  he  was  trained. 
Two  years  before  his  death  he  wrote  a  work  on  the  philosophy 
called  Hortensius.  The  dialog  is  named  after  Cicero's  friend,  the 
speaker  and  politician  Quintus  Hortensius  Hortalus.  In  this  work 


-67- 


he  mentions  a  game  with  12  pieces  which  is  called  “duodecim 
scrupis”: 

Itaque  tibi  concedo,  quod  in  duodecim  scrupis  olim,  ut  calculum 
reducas,  si  te  alicuius  dati  poeniteat. 

Translation: 

I  allow  you,  as  we  usually  do  in  the  game  with  12  stones,  that  you  can 
put  the  stone  back  if  you  do  regret  your  move. 


5.1.2  Marco  Fabio  Quintilianus 

Marco  Fabio  Quintilianus  (42-120?)  was  a  famous  Spanish 
writer  of  the  Roman  era,  bom  in  Calagrurris  (Calahorra, 
Logrono)  around  the  year  42  and  deceased  between  years  95 
and  120  of  our  era.  He  wrote  The  Institutione  Oratorios,  a  very 
important  work  that  alone  was  to  make  him  immortal.  It 
consists  of  12  books.  The  books  VIII  and  IX  deal  with  the 
phraseology. 


Book  X  deals  with  practices  of 
composition,  literature,  and  imitation, 
while  it  provides  a  critical  reflection  on 
the  main  Greek  and  Roman  authors 
where  they  are  useful  for  the  speaker 
and  they  form  a  historical  summary  of 
the  literature.  Book  XI  covers  mainly 
memory,  pronunciation,  gestures,  and 
the  action,  and  detects  pointed

Marco  Fabio  Quintilianus  (Calahorra)

In  1417  Poggio  found  by  accident  the  first  complete  manuscript 
of  the  work  The  Institutione  Oratorios  in  the  convent  of  San 
Gall  when  he  was  attending  the  Council  of  Constanta.  We  owe 
the  first  edition  to  Philip  Lignamine  (Rome,  1470).  Then  came 
Jensan  (Venice)  1481),  Aldo  (Venice,  1514),  and  Lerevelio 
Gronovius  (Leiden,  1665)138.  Nebrija139  wrote  about  this  author 
and  Caro140  quotes  him  as  follows: 

De  institutione  oratoria,  lib.  XI,  2.38 

At  vero  Scaevola  in  ludo  duodecim  scruporum,  cum  prior  calculum 
promovisset  essetque  victus,  dum  rus  tendit,  repetito  totius  certaminis 
ordine,  quo  dato  errasset  recordatus,  rediit  ad  eum,  quicum  luserat, 
isque  ita  factum  esse  confessus  est. 

Translation: 

We  are  told  that  Scaevola,  after  a  game  of  Latrunculus  in  which  he 
had  made  the  first  move  and  was  defeated,  went  over  the  whole  game 
again  in  his  mind  on  his  way  to  the  country,  and  on  recalling  the 
move  which  had  cost  him  the  game  returned  to  tell  the  man  with 
whom  he  had  been  playing,  and  the  latter  acknowledged  that  he  was 
right. 


Pietro  Carrera  refers  to  a  part  of  the  abovementioned  text141:

5.1.3  Deciderius  Erasmus  Rotter damus 

Desiderius  Erasmus  Roterodamus  (1466-1536),  known  as 
Erasmus  of  Rotterdam,  was  a  Dutch  Renaissance  humanist, 
Catholic  priest,  and  theologian. 


Desiderius  Erasmus 

Erasmus  was  a  classical  scholar  who  wrote  in  a  pure  Latin  style 
and  enjoyed  the  sobriquet  "Prince  of  the  Humanists."  He  has 
been  called  "the  crowning  glory  of  the  Christian  humanists. 
Erasmus  preferred  to  live  the  life  of  an  independent  scholar  and 
made  a  conscious  effort  to  avoid  any  actions  or  formal  ties  that 
might  inhibit  his  freedom  of  intellect  and  literary  expression. 
Throughout  his  life  he  was  offered  many  positions  of  honour 
and  profit  throughout  the  academic  world,  but  declined  them  all, 
preferring  the  uncertain  but  sufficient  rewards  of  independent 
literary  activity.  Erasmus  wrote  both  on  ecclesiastic  subjects 
and  those  of  general  human  interest.  He  seems  to  have  regarded 
the  latter  as  trifling,  a  leisure  activity.  By  the  1530s  the  writings 
of  Erasmus  accounted  for  10  to  20  percent  of  all  book  sales.  He 
is  credited  with  coining  the  adage  “in  the  land  of  the  blind  the 
one-eyed  man  is  king”.  By  collaboration  with  Publio  Fausto 


-70- 


Andrelini  he  formed  a  collection  of  Latin  proverbs  and  adages 

142 

commonly  called  Adagia.  In  1500  Erasmus  wrote  the 
following  about  “Duodecim  Scruporum”: 


Calcvlvm  redvcere.  Apponere  calcvlvm. 

Mirum  ni  prouerbialis  est  metaphora,  qua  Cicero  vsus  est  in 
Hortensio,  Nonio  teste:  Itaque  tibi  concedo  quod  in  duodecim  scrupis 
olim,  vt  calculum  reducas,  si  te  alicuius  dati  poeniteat.  Translatum 
apparet  aut  a  ratiocinantibus  aut  certe  a  latrunculario  lusu.  Est  igitur 
'calculum  reducere'  reuocare,  si  quid  imprudentius  concesseris, 
mutareque  factum,  cuius  te  poeniteat.  Id  propemodum  exponens 
Politianus  Quoniam ,  inquit,  moti  semel  poeniteret,  concedi  sibi 
postularet,  vt  calculum  reduceret.  Prouerbii  simillimum  est  et  hoc: 
Apponere  calculum,  pro  eo  quod  accessionem  adiungere,  a 
ratiocinantibus  deductum,  vt  'Etsi  iam  olim  amas  plurimum,  tamen  et 
hunc  calculum  ex  mea  commendatione  velim  accedere'.  Et  albus 
calculus  pro  studio  et  fauore  apud  Plinium  Cecilium. 

Loose  Translation 

Astonishing,  unless  it  is  a  proverbial  metaphor  used  by  Cicero  in 
Hortensius ,  according  to  Nonius:  therefore  I  grant  what  formerly  in 
twelve  scrupis  (worries  in  the  game  of  the  twelve  pieces),  that  you 
may  retire  your  piece  if  you  regret  some  move.  It  seems  translated 
either  by  calculating  people  (businessmen?)  or  certainly  by  game  of 
pieces.  Therefore  "to  retire  a  piece"  is  to  recall  it  if  you 
recognize  something  imprudent,  to  change  what  is  done  of  which  you 
repent.  Approximately  Politianus  explains  this  saying,  Because  once 
regretting  the  move,  he  asked  permission  to  retire  the  piece.  Very 
similar  is  this  proverb:  To  add  a  piece,  meaning  to  join  an  action, 
deduced  by  calculators,  so  that  "Although  you  already  bet  much, 
nevertheless  I  would  like  you  to  add  this  piece  on  my 
recommendation".  And  white  piece  means  affection  and  favour  in 
Plinius  Caecilius143.

5.1.4  Gerolamo  Cardano 

Gerolamo  (or  Girolamo,  or  Geronimo)  Cardano  (French: 
Jerome  Cardan;  Latin:  Hieronymus  Cardanus  -  1501-1576)  was 
an  Italian  Renaissance  mathematician,  physician,  astrologer, 
and  gambler.  His  gambling  led  him  to  formulate  elementary 
rules  in  probability,  making  him  one  of  the  founders  of  the  field. 
He  was  bom  in  Pavia,  Lombardy,  the  illegitimate  child  of  Fazio 
Cardano,  a  mathematically  gifted  lawyer,  who  was  a  friend  of 
Leonardo  da  Vinci. 


Gerolamo  Cardano 


In  1520  he  entered  the  University  of  Pavia  and  later  studied 
medicine  in  Padua.  His  eccentric  and  confrontational  style  did 
not  earn  him  many  friends  and  he  had  a  difficult  time  finding 
work  after  his  studies  ended.  In  1525  Cardano  repeatedly 
applied  to  the  College  of  Physicians  in  Milan,  but  was  not 
admitted  owing  to  his  combative  reputation  and  illegitimate 
birth.  Eventually  he  managed  to  develop  a  considerable 


-72- 


reputation  as  a  physician  and  his  services  were  highly  valued  in 
the  courts.  He  was  the  first  to  describe  typhoid  fever.  Cardano 
was  notoriously  short  of  money  and  kept  himself  solvent  by 
being  an  accomplished  gambler  and  chess  player.  His  book 
about  games  of  chance  Liber  de  ludo  aleae  ("Book  on  Games 
of  Chance")  written  in  1526  but  not  published  until  1663 
contains  the  first  systematic  treatment  of  probability,  as  well  as 
a  section  on  effective  cheating  methods144.  Cardano  was 
probably  the  first  scholar  to  expound  intelligently  on  the  theory 
of  probability  and  do  so  about  one  century  prior  to  Pascal  and 
Fermat  who  are  conceded  to  have  laid  the  first  foundations  of 
the  science  of  probability.  Precisely  in  this  book  Cardono  refers 
to  Duodecim  scruporum  when  he  describes  the  Totae  Tabulae. 
Prof.  Ore  Oystein  in  his  book  The  Gambling  Scholar 145  gives  us 
the  English  translation. 

...videtur  Quintilianus  quoque,  vt  idem  Calcagnius  recitat  dixisse: 
quo  dato  errasset  recordatus  rediit  ad  eum  qui  cum  luserat;  sed  cum 
loquatur  de  lusu  duodecim  scruporum  videtur  Datum  ad  ludum 
transtulisse  quidem,  non  tamen  ad  Aleam. 

Translation: 

...Quintiliaan  seems  also,  as  that  same  Calcagninus  avers,  to  have 
said,  “remembering  with  what  dice  he  had  gone  wrong  he  returned  to 
the  one  with  which  he  had  played”;  but  when  he  speaks  about  a  game 
of  twelve  scrupi,  he  seems  to  have  related  the  word  datus  to  a  game, 
but  not  to  a  game  with  dice. 

We  see  that  Cardono  refers  to  the  work  of  Calcagninus  and  to  a 
mind  game  without  dice.

5.1.5  Ulisses  Aldrovandi 

Ulisses  Aldrovandi  (1522-1605)  was  a  famous  natural  scientist, 
philosopher,  and  doctor.  He  descended  from  a  prominent  and 
wealthy  family  and  was  educated  in  Bologna  and  Padua.  In 
1549  after  completing  his  studies  he  was  imprisoned  on 
suspicion  of  lutheranism.  He  only  got  his  freedom  back  after  the 
death  of  Pope  Paulo  III.  Then  he  traveled  throughout  Europe. 
He  was  appointed  lecturer  in  the  Study  Chamber  of  Bologna 
when  he  devoted  himself  to  teaching,  which  he  alternated  with 
many  journeys. 

He  wrote  a  manuscript,  according  to  Dr.  Chicco146  in  1556, 
about  the  games  titled  ‘De  ludis  turn  publicis  turn  privatis 
methodus  turn'.  Hereafter  I  continue  with  my  English  translation 
of  Dr.  Chico’s  Italian  text  that  was  given  by  Dr.  Pratesi147.

Almost  contemporary  is  the  citation  of  the  draughts  game  contained 
in  a  manuscript  of  the  great  naturalist  Ulisse  Aldrovandi,  which 
remained  unpublished,  preserved  in  the  University  Library  of 
Bologna  (Miscellaneous  A  21),  and  is  entitled  “De  Ludis  turn  publicis 
turn  privatis  Methodus”.  Registered  with  separate  numbers  and  index 
after  the  letter  825,  the  Methodus  from  page  20  to  25  contains  a 
discussion  of  the  draughts  game  that  has  been  completely  ignored  by 
scholars  of  this  game  despite  being  the  oldest  Italian  text 
that  contains  the  rules  of  draughts  in  Italy.  Aldrovandi  had  the  first 
idea  of  this  paper  since  1556,  as  evidenced  by  a  series  of  notes  (-De 
Ludo-)  stored  in  other  Miscellaneous  A  64  of  the  same  library,  dated 
December  15,  1556:  the  next  and  more  extensive  preparation  is  then 
fixed  after  this  date.  Aldrovandi  titled  the  chapter  on  draughts 
‘Scruporum  duodecim  ludus  fabis’,  but  also  gives  the  Italian  name  for 
draughts  ‘gioco  di  Dama’  and  adds  the  Belgian  (German?)  name 
‘Damen’  and  the  French  name  ‘jeu  aux  Dames’. 

The  curious  name  of  fabae  (broad  bean)  results  from  the  fact  that 
Aldrovandi,  a  good  naturalist,  considered  that  these  beans  were  used 
as  pawns,  replacing  the  small  stones  or  discs.  He  details  the 
arrangement  of  checkers  which  can  either  be  placed  in  all  black 
squares  or  in  all  white  squares,  all  of  them  in  the  first  three  rows  of 
the  opposing  sides;  he  describes  the  movement  and  how  to  capture, 
warning  that  it  is  necessary  to  capture  to  the  square  behind  the 
opponent  when  it  is  not  occupied  by  a  “custos”;  he  remembers  that  if 
a  pawn  reaches  the  last  rank,  it  becomes  a  Dama:  then  it  can  be 
marked  by  two  beans,  or  if  playing  with  discs,  two  superimposed 
discs. 

La  Dama  (King  in  other  countries)  enjoys  various  privileges,  because 
it  can  go  back  and  cannot  be  captured  by  an  isolated  pawn,  and  if  it  is 
attacked  simultaneously  by  two  pawns  and  has  no  square  behind  the 
"Custodes",  one  of  the  two  pawns  can  capture  it.  This  deviation  from 
the  current  rules  probably  originated  from  some  reminiscence  of  the 
rules  in  force  in  northern  European  countries,  which  admitted  the 
capture  of  the  King  by  the  pawn. 

Maybe  with  the  name  of  the  game  ‘Scruporum  duodecim  ludus 
fabis’,  in  which  figures  the  term  ‘fabis’  Aldrovandi  had  in  mind 
Marcus  Fabius  Quintilianus,  because  this  author  was  also  called 


-75- 


Marcus  Fabis  Quintilianus.  The  text  refers  to  the  Latin  author 
Marco  Fabio  Quintilian  of  Spanish  origin.  Since  this  author’s 
work  was  written  in  1567,  it  seems  plausible  to  assume  that 
Aldrovandi’s  work  was  actually  written  in  the  late  16th  century, 
as  Dr.  Pratesi148  cites,  and  various  aspects  of  literature  were 
based  on  an  earlier  work149. 


5.1.6  Adrianus  Iunius 

The  real  name  of  Adrianus  Iunius  (1511-1575)  was  Adrian  de 
Jonghe.  He  was  bom  in  Hoom  (Holland)  in  1511  and  died  in 
Arnemuiden  in  1575.  He  graduated  as  medical  doctor  in 
Bologna  and  traveled  through  many  countries,  such  as  France, 
England,  and  Denmark.  Since  1565  he  was  a  physician 
employed  by  the  municipality  and  Rector  of  the  Latin  School  in 
Haarlem. 


His  nickname  was  Second  Erasmus.  Hereunder  follow  some  of 
the  translations  in  his  dictionaries.

5.1.7  Cornells  Kilianus 

Comelis  Kiliaan  or  Kilianus  (ca.  1529  -  1607)  was  a  Southern 
Dutch  linguist  and  poet.  In  1548  Kilianus  went  to  the  University 
of  Leuven  to  study  Latin,  Greek,  Hebrew,  and  law.  After  his 
studies  he  started  in  the  newly  established  printing  house  of 
Christopher  Plantin,  which  was  to  become  the  largest  printing 
company  in  Europe  at  the  time.  He  marched  through  the 
professional  ranks  of  his  master’s  sophisticated  Antwerp 
workshop  from  trainee  to  expert  and  master,  both  correcting  and 
editing,  whilst  seeing  new  editions  through  the  presses.  Kilianus 
never  left  Christoffel  Plantijn. 


Cornelis  Kilianus 

Innocent  of  academic  lore,  Kiliaan  became  a  linguist  and 
lexicographer.  His  magnum  opus  Dictionarium  Teutonico- 
latinum  (1574;  reprinted  and  expanded  in  1588  and 


-78- 


1599)  remained  an  asset  for  scholars  hailing  from  regions  where 
Germanic  languages  were  spoken  for  centuries  to  come.  Kiliaan 
may  be  the  first  individual  wishing  to  make  a  complete 
inventory  of  the  vocabulary  he  used  himself  daily;  the  product 
of  his  toil  is  the  mother  of  all  Dutch  dictionaries.  In  the  enlarged 
second  edition  of  his  Dictionarium  Teutonico-latinum  (1588) 
Kiliaan  developed  his  scientific  language  study  even  further 
with  the  help  of  many  great  new  sources,  including  many 
humanistic,  encyclopaedic,  or  historical  works  written  in  Latin. 
This  time  he  offered  many  more  etymological  explanations  of 
words  and  also  lists  alongside  German  and  French,  the 
equivalents  of  Dutch  keywords  in  English,  Saxon,  Spanish, 
Italian,  Greek,  and  Hebrew.

-79- 


The  humanists  of  the  Renaissance  in  Europe  (not  in  Spain)  tried 
to  bring  back  the  then  current  games  to  the  classical  authors. 
Thus  in  the  16th  century  the  checkers,  which  was  hidden  under 
the  Latin  name  ‘Scruporum  duodecim  lusus’  was  confused  with 
Tudo  duodecim  Scruporum’  described  by  Marco  Fabio 
Quintilian  in  the  year  65.  However,  the  game  cited  by  him  and 
played  by  Scaevola  seems  to  have  been  backgammon. 

In  all  probability  both  Aldrovandi154  and  Hadrian  Junius155 
wanted  to  refer  to  Fabius  Marco  Quintilianus  with  the  words 
"fabis"  and  “Fabio”.  This  writer's  literature  became  available 
only  in  1417,  so  that  when  Tudo  duodecim  Scruporum’  really 
would  have  been  a  draughts  game,  this  Latin  term  could  never 
be  used  in  the  14th  century. 


5.1.8  Pedro  Pantoja  de  Ayala 

When  speaking  about  the  sacred  line  we  immediately  have  to 
think  of  the  jurisconsult  and  poet  Doctor  Pedro  Pantoja  de 
Ayala,  bom  in  1589  in  Toledo156  and  died  in  1625.  He  studied 
with  Alphonso  Guillen  de  la  Carrera  and  other  experts  in  law 
acquiring  good  knowledge  of  the  classic  literature.  He  was 
judge  at  the  Court  of  Sevilla  and  hearer157  in  Sevilla  still  in 
1635.  On  the  other  hand  he  also  was  adviser  to  his  Majesty  and

1633158.  Pedro  Pantoja  de  Ayala  [Aldrete]  was  one  of 
the  sources  for  the  game  book  of  Rodrigo  Caro159.  His  book 
was  a  legal  work  written  in  Latin  about  the  games  of  at  least 
272  pages.  Dr.  Franco  Pratesi160  has  extensive  studies  of  the 
work  of  Pantoja  de  Ayala  thanks  to  the  works  of  Clodius161 
and  Otto162. 

Pantoja  de  Ayala  discusses  on  his  way  the  draughts  game163, 
because  the  text  he  gives  is  rather  confusing  due  to  the  manner 
of  capturing.  Maybe  it  had  to  do  with  the  game  that  Ficoroni 
was  describing  about  Celio  Calcagninus.

This  game  is  still  played  by  us  and  we  call  it  de  las  Damas.  When  two 
players  have  each  12  pieces,  white  or  black,  and  attack  the  enemy  like 
in  a  war,  and  a  piece  is  between  two  pieces  of  another  colour,  then 
this  piece  is  captured  and  taken  away.  However,  a  piece  that  on  the 
contrary  is  placed  on  the  middle  line,  i.e.  on  the  so-called  calle  de  en 
medio ,  can  go  back  and  forth  between  the  enemy  pieces  and  then  it  is 
secure  as  if  it  were  in  a  hiding  place. 


Treatise  of  Games  of  Pedro  Pantoja  de  Ayala 


-82- 


Pedro  Pantoja  de  Ayala  refers  to  the  book  of  Pedro  Ruiz 
Montero164,  on  which  the  information  he  had  obtained  from  his 
friend  Thomas  de  Tamayo  de  Vargas.  However  in  the  book  of 
Ruiz  Montero  the  capturing  is  the  same  as  in  Alquerque  12,  thus 
leaping  and  Pantoja  de  Ayala  speaks  about  “surrounding”  the 
piece  for  capturing.  Pratesi  thinks  that  this  way  of  capturing  has 
to  do  with  the  “old  manner”.  However,  if  the  piece  is  on  the 
middle  or  sacred  line,  it  cannot  be  captured.  So  here  I  am 
thinking  of  the  two  corporals  that  each  player  had  in  the  case  of 
Celio  Calcagninus. 

Strangely  enough,  Pantoja  de  Ayala  used  the  exact  name  of  this 
line  “calle  de  en  medio”  in  modern  draughts.  In  such  case  the 
Dama  can  quietly  resist  the  attack  of  2  or  3  pieces  without  being 
captured  and  one  can  say  that  the  Dama  is  in  a  secure  and 
hiding  place.

5.2  Ludus  Calculorum 


The  Latin  term  for  draughts,  thus  for  the  new  Andarraya  game 
with  the  use  of  the  new  Dama  in  1495  according  to  Antonio 
Nebrija,  was  calculorum  ludus.  This  term  ‘Ludus  Calculorum’ 
was  used  both  for  Alquerque  and  Andarraya.  Thus  according  to 
Nebrija  in  his  Latin  dictionary  of  1495  Andarrya  became  a  new 
game.  So  the  question  now  is  what  exactly  do  we  know  about 
Ludus  Calculorum. 


5.2.1  Antonio  de  Nebrija 

Antonio  de  Nebrija  (1444-1522)  was  bom  in  Lebrija  (the  Latin 
name  is  Nebrissa),  Seville,  and  died  in  Alcala  de  Henares  in 
1522.  He  was  known  as  Antonio  de  Nebrija,  Elio  Antonio  de 
Lebrija,  Antonius  Nebrissensis,  and  Antonio  of  Lebrixa.  After 
studying  in  Salamanca  he  resided  for  ten  years  in  Italy,  and 
completed  his  education  at  Bologna  University.  On  his  return  to 
Spain  (1473)  he  devoted  himself  to  the  advancement  of  classical 
learning  among  his  fellow  countrymen. 

After  obtaining  professorship  of  poetry  and  grammar  at 
Salamanca  he  was  transferred  to  the  University  of  Alcala  de 
Henares.  He  was  a  famous  Spanish  scholar  known  for  writing 
the  grammar  of  the  Castilian  language,  credited  as  one  of  the 
first  published  grammars  of  a  Romance  language.  He  is  the 
author  of  an  impressive  body  of  scientific  work  which 
comprises  a  broad  spectrum  of  humanistic  knowledge.  While 
the  languages  dealt  with  by  Nebrija  include  Latin,  Spanish,  and 


-85- 


the  most  prominent  Romance  languages,  his  grammatical  work 
focuses  on  Latin,  Castillian,  Greek,  and  even  Hebrew. 


Nebrija  sought  to  standardize  and  regularize  the  Spanish 
language  and  spelling,  frequently  under  the  patronage  of  Queen 
Isabella. 


He  published  the  first  reliable  Latin  grammar  in  Spain, 
Introductiones  latine  (1481),  which  he  later  translated  into 
Spanish.  Other  works  include  Interpretatio  dictionum  ex 
sermone  latino  in  hispaniensem165 ,  and  the  first  scientific

5.2.2  Juan  Luis  Vives 

Juan  Luis  Vives  was  bom  in  Valencia  in  1493  and  died  in 
Brugge  [now  Belgium]  in  1540.  He  was  a  Spanish  humanist  and 
student  of  Erasmus,  eminent  in  education,  philosophy,  and 
psychology,  who  strongly  opposed  scholasticism  and 
emphasized  induction  as  a  method  of  inquiry.  Vives  left  Spain 
at  the  age  of  17  to  avoid  the  Inquisition. 


LVDOVICVS  VIVES,  VALENT  IN  VS. 


After  studies  in  Paris  (1509-1512)  Vives  also  came  into  contact 
with  the  Parisian  humanist  circle.  In  1514  Vives  left  Paris 
without  having  taken  any  formal  academic  degree  and  moved  to 


-88- 


the  Low  Countries.  He  settled  in  Bruges  where  he  would  spend 
most  of  his  life.  He  was  never  to  return  to  Spain.  He  attended 
lectures  at  the  university  of  Louvain  in  1514  and  was  appointed 
professor  of  the  humanities  and  qualified  as  lecturer  in  1520.  He 
married  Margaret  Valdaura  of  Bruges  in  1524.  Over  the  years 
Vives  left  Bruges  intermittently.  Especially  significant  is  the 
period  between  1523  and  1528  when  he  lectured  at  Oxford 
University  (Corpus  Christi  College)  and  met,  or  continued 
earlier  friendships  with,  Thomas  More,  John  Fisher,  and 
Thomas  Linacre,  and  was  highly  regarded  by  Henry  VIII  and 
his  queen  Catherine  of  Aragon.  On  intimate  terms  with  the 
greatest  humanists  of  his  day,  including  Erasmus  and  Bude, 
Vives  was  not  only  a  master  of  classical  Latin  literature  (he 
apparently  cared  much  less  for  the  Greek  classics),  but  also 
wrote  on  religion,  education,  rhetoric,  philosophy, 
methodology,  science.  The  last  twelve  years  of  Vives'  life  were 
his  most  productive,  and  it  was  in  this  period  that  he  published 
several  of  the  works  for  which  he  is  best  known  today.  He  wrote 
many  books  and  one  of  them,  the  Exercitatio  linguae  Latinae 
sive  Colloquia,  shows  an  Alquerque-12  board.  The  text  was  the 
following: 

VI.  Reditus  Domum,  et  lusus  Pueriles 

Corneliola:  Ludi  huius  iam  taedet,  ludamus  calculis  discoloribus169 

Tulliolus:  Pinge  tu  nobis  urbes  in  hoc  latere,  carbone  aut  gypso. 

Translation: 

Corneliola:  I'm  tired  of  this  game,  let  us  play  with  stones  of  two 

colors. 

That  calculus  discolores,  will  it  not  be  alquerque? 

Tulliolus:  Paint  your  squares  on  this  side  with  coal  or  plaster.

Drawing  of  the  Alquerque-12  in  the  book  of  1538 


So  we  see  that  the  Spaniard  Juan  Luis  Vives  is  using  the  term 
‘Calculis’  for  Alquerque-12. 

Quite  interesting  is  to  see  the  development  of  this  famous  book 
in  other  countries:

1555,  with  Spanish  text  and  an  Alquerque-12  board  we 
see:

1573,  with  a  French  text171  and  an  Alquerque-12  board  we 
see: 

Ce  ieu  commence  a  m’ennuyer, 

(....)  iouons  aux  dames 

1582,  with  German  text172  and  an  Alquerque-12  board  we 
see:

Translation: 

The  fourth  kind  of  childish  game  with  colored  stones.  That  game 
‘duodecim  Scruporum’  according  to  Quintilian:  to  the  Germans,  the 
game  of  the  twelve  stones. 

For  it  is  twelve  stones  or  pebbles,  six  whites  and  six  blacks.  The 
French  (Gauls)  call  it  the  game  of  the  ladies  (dames). 


Here  we  observe  in  the  16th  century  the  different  terms  for 
Alquerque-12  and  I  think  that  the  French  term  iouons  aux 
dames  has  to  do  with  Alquerque-12  and  the  new  “dame”  piece 
in  this  game.  So  I  do  not  think  that  it  had  already  to  do  with  a 
draughts  game  played  on  a  checkered  chess  board.  The  question 
remains  when  exactly  the  draughts  game  was  used  in  France, 
Italy,  and  England.

5.2.3  Caelius  Calcagninus 

Caelius  Calcagninus  (1479-1541)  also  known  as  Celio 
Calcagnini  was  an  Italian  humanist  and  scientist  from  Ferrara. 
Educated  in  Ferrara,  after  about  ten  years  of  service  in  the 
Ferrarese  armies  he  returned  to  Ferrara  en  1506173  and  was 
given  the  chair  of  Greek  and  Latin  at  the  University  of  Ferrara 
in  1507  or  1509.  He  was  admitted  to  the  chancery  of  Cardinal 
Ippolito  d’Este  in  1510.  He  had  a  major  influence  on  Rabelais 
literary  and  linguistic  ideas  and  is  presumed  to  have  met  him  in 
Italy  and  was  praised  by  Erasmus.  Calcagninus  must  have 
known  the  Spanish  Jew  Francesch  Vicent,  who  showed  the  first 
diagrams  of  the  draughts  game  at  the  beginning  of  the  16th 
century  and  was  in  the  service  of  Lucrecia  Borgia  at  the  court  of 
Ferrara.

Calcagnini’s  treatise  Quomodo  caelum  stet,  terra  moveatur,  vel 
de  perenni  motu  terrae  commentatio,  in  which  he  held  that  the 
earth  moved  around  the  sun,  anticipated  Galileo  Galilei  by  some 
years,  for  Galileo  was  not  bom  until  1564.  In  1509  he  was 
called  to  the  chair  of  Greek  and  Latin  letters  at  the  University  of 
Ferrara,  a  position  that  he  held  for  the  rest  of  his  life.  In  1510  he 
entered  the  service  of  the  Church  as  canon  of  the  cathedral  of 
Ferrara  and  earned  the  rank  of  protonotary.  Calcagnini  earned 
his  doctorate  in  canon  law  in  1514,  and  his  rhetorical  skills  and 
sophisticated  wit  won  him  the  appointment  of  official  historian 
of  the  Este  court174  in  1517.  He  was  married  to  Marietta  Strozzi. 

Calcagninus  was  a  good  friend  of  Erasmus,  Ludovico  Ariosto, 
the  painter  Raphael175,  and  Isabella  D’este  for  whom  he  wrote 
poetry  on  the  occasion  of  the  death  of  her  dog  Aura  in  1507176.

The  reader  who  studies  a  portion  of  the  treatise  De  Calculis  that 
bears  the  title  Ludo  Calculario  XII  will  soon  understand  that  the 
Greek  and  Latin  professor  Caelius  Calcagninus  describes  the 
game  of  Alquerque  (the  precursor  of  draughts).  In  his  time  this 
game  was  known  all  over  Western  Europe.  It  was  engraved  in 
the  choral  benches  and  played  in  galleys.  A  popular  Belgian 
Latin  textbook  for  students  even  contained  a  drawing  of  the 
board.  Maybe  in  the  Netherlands  this  game  bore  the  name 
‘twaelfstecken’.  The  reason  that  a  highly  educated  man  was 
engaged  in  this  game  was  the  idea  that  the  strains  came  from  the 
classical  period  and  so  it  would  have  high  quality.  Here  one  had 
to  think  of  the  mysterious  5-line  game  mentioned  by  Julius 
Pollux  and/or  the  Polis  or  City  Game.  (Also  called  Soldiers’ 
Game).  The  humanists  Freigius,  Raderus,  and  Senftlebius  also 
thought  that  Calcagninus  described  the  game  of  Alquerque177. 
Ficoroni178  gave  an  abbreviated  Italian  translation  of  the  article 
by  Calcagninus,  in  which  the  position  of  the  10  pawns  and  two 
leaders  is  emphasized.  Finally  Pratesi  gives  a  short 
description  and  English  translation  of  the  work  of  Calcagnini: 

This  work  is  often  quoted  as  one  of  the  first  descriptions  clearly 
distinguishing  between  chess  and  ludus  latrunculorum.  Another 
merit  may  be  the  quotation  of  the  game  which  we  know  as  tangram:  it 
came  to  Europe  from  China  about  two  centuries  ago,  but  evidently  it 
was  already  known  to  classical  civilisations.  Calcagnini  ’  s 
language  has  lost  the  grace  of  classical  Latin;  moreover  the  text  is

affected  by  several  printing  errors.  Thus  the  treatise  has  yet  to  be  fully 
understood,  at  least  in  some  parts.

(With  respect  to  chess)  all  that  is 
different  and  five  lines  form  1 6 
squares,  namely  regions  or 
cities,  as  you  prefer  to  name 
them. 

2. 

But  in  the  boardgame  of  pebbles 
12  soldiers  to  the  top,  ordered  in 
two  groups  of  ten  and  two 
lateral  chiefs,  exert  all  the  army, 
and  you  can  realise  in  them  the 
art  of  deploying  the  military 
array.  Indeed,  in  the  front  the 
orders  are  connected  by  number 
V:  on  the  other  hand  the 
thickness  is  established  by  a 
triple  array,  so  that  it  occupies 
12  squares. 

3. 

In  fact,  to  a  quick  and  ordered 
man  4  squares  are  assigned. 
Since  however  the  ferse 
extends  its  action  on  14  squares, 
so  that  the  ferse  of  the  outermost 
order  or  (if  we  may  so  say)  the 
triple  one  will  not  be  useless,  it 
must  be  given  to  the  enemy  if 
attacked  by  two  squares.

This  is  that  image  of  the  army 
which  is  represented  by  moving 
with  pebbles.  Otherwise  to  that 
which  went  out  from  its  own

hostium  perveniret:  quod  quom 
facile  fiat,  si  latera  agminis 
enudetur,  ob  id  constitutum 
accepimus,  ne  quis  de  sacra 
linea,  id  est  media  decedat,  cui 
laterales  praestites  praefecti 
sunt.  Ea  enim  prodita  turn 
caetera  acies  incursionibus 
hostium  facile  patet. 


5. 

Ab  eadem  ratione  militari 
deductum  est,  ut  miles  qui  castra 
hostium  penetrarit,  et  in  arces 
evaserit,  quasi  murali  corona 
donatus,  virtutis  ergo  late 
impune  pervagetur:  nec  nisi  ter 
circumventus  succubuisse 
iudicetur. 

6. 

Illud  praeterea  hostimentum  in 
utroque  agmine  servabatur:  ut 
quasi  collatis  signis  vir  viro 
implexus  confligeret:  et  quorum 
altera  parte  cornu  pelleretur, 
altera  hostem  urgeret:  ut  ita 
in  tota  concertatione  commutato 
victoriae  ordine  paria  fierent 
(Calcagninus,  1544). 


occurred,  as  it  arrived 
surrounded  in  the  hands  of  the 
enemies-  a  thing  that  easily 
would  occur,  if  the  flanks  of  the 
array  had  to  be  voided. 

Therefore,  we  consider 
ascertained  that  nobody  should 
go  out  of  the  holy  line,  namely 
the  middle  one,  to  whom  lateral 
officials  are  commanding.  In 
fact,  if  it  is  abandoned  then  the 
remaining  part  of  the  array 
easily  suffers  the  attacks  of  the 
enemy. 

5. 

From  the  same  military  reason  is 
derived  that  as  a  man  enters  the 
enemy  camp  and  has  access  to 
the  fortress,  being  awarded  as  if 
with  a  stone  crown,  it  may 
wander  about  with  impunity  and 
may  be  considered  to  have  been 
captured  only  if  three  times 
surrounded. 

6. 

Moreover,  in  both  arrays  they 
followed  this  reciprocation:  that 
with  the  signs  brought 
together  one  fights  man  to  man; 
and  of  them  one  is  driven  to  the 
corner  while  the 
other  will  push  the  enemy;  so 
that  in  the  whole  struggle  by 
changing  the  order  of  the 
victory  it  becomes  equal. _ 


Here  we  observe  that  this  type  of  Alquerque  12  has  two  leaders 
at  the  beginning,  i.e.  two  strong  pieces  and  10  pawns.  Strangely 
enough,  we  have  seen  something  similar  in  two  compositions  of

Juan  de  Timoneda  ,  where  there  are  two  Damas  in  the  initial 
position  of  the  game.  This  is  pure  chess,  as  says  Jose  Antonio 
Garzon  Roger.

Juan  de  Timoneda,  Party  game  42 

But  most  surprising  is  the  fact  that  there  are  also  chess  precedents, 
discovered  by  Jose  Antonio  Garzon  Roger  and  also  linked  to 
Valencia.  One  comes  from  a  second  treaty  of  Francesch 
Vicent181,  not  less  egregious  than  the  printed  book  in  Valencia 
in  1495,  the  Holy  Grail  of  chess,  now  finally  recovered182.

Garzon  with  his  new  book  ,  in  this  case  about  the  famous  poet 
Juan  de  Timoneda,  refers  to  the  composition  150  of  Lucena  , 
who  copied  the  treaty  of  Franchesh  Vicent  in  1497. 

But  the  composition  150  in  the  book  of  Lucena  is  not  the  only 
composition  in  which  we  see  two  damas.  In  the  manuscripts  of 
Cesena  (position  9-2)  and  Perugia  (position  1 1),  made  by 
Francesch  Vicent  white  starts  the  game  with  two  queens,  as 
indicated  by  Garzon185.  It  is  interesting  to  see  that  a  so  called 
queen  dama  caballota  also  has  the  power  of  a  knight. 

Thus  we  see  that  at  the  beginning  of  the  16th  century  two 
leaders  or  strong  pieces  were  used  in  Alquerque  12,  chess,  and 
draughts.  Apart  from  the  composition  number  150  in  the  book 
of  Lucena  there  are  no  more  proofs  of  it  in  chess,  but  the 
situation  is  quite  different  for  draughts.

We  see  in  the  draughts  book  of  Juan  Garcia  Canalejas  of  1650 
that  he  discusses  100  openings,  in  which  each  player  can 
dispose  of  a  Dama  in  the  initial  position.  In  these  100  openings 
of  the  game  we  see  that  the  dama  in  question  of  each  player  is 
put  by  the  opponent  in  different  places.  This  matter  is  more 
interesting  when  we  see  that  Garcia  Canalejas186  discusses  30 
openings,  in  which  each  player  has  two  Damas!

6  salidas,  y  muchos  lances  sueltos  para  dar  a  escoger,  y  otras  curiosidades. 
Compuesto  por  Juan  Garcia  Canalejas,  vezino  de  la  ciudad  de  Granada. 
Dirigido  a  don  Juan  Baptista  Pertusa,  caballero  del  habito  de  nuestra  Senora 
de  Montesa  de  la  ciudad  de  Valencia.  Con  licencia.  En  Qaragoga,  por  Juan

In  the  first  French  draughts  book  Le  iev  des  dames  written  by 
the  engineer  Pierre  Mallet187  in  1668  we  see  that  in  the  opening 
position  of  the  game  both  white  and  black  has  4  crowned 
pieces!  They  are  called  “Dames  couronees”. 

This  book  was  written  in  1668,  thus  121  years  later  than  the  first 
Spanish  draughts  book!  The  book  gives  little  technical  news 
about  the  draughts  game  and  according  to  Mallet  the  game  is 
called  ‘Le  iev  des  dames’  because  the  ‘Dames’  (ladies)  like  to 
play  the  game  with  much  conversation.  The  author  names  nine 
known  draughts  players,  among  them  the  famous  mathematician 
Pierre  Herigone  and  a  very  strong  draughts  player  called  Sieur 
l’Hoste,  an  unlearned  person  who  knew  more  than  1000 
draughts  games  from  memory  .  There  were  two  ways  of 
playing:  “pleasant”  or  “format”. 

The  draughts  historian  Branch  also  speaks  about  two  queens  in 

1  &Q 

the  draughts  game  of  the  Spaniards  : 

Another  difference,  but  a  matter  of  custom  and  not  of  rules,  is  that  the 
Spaniards  frequently  play  with  eleven  men  and  a  King  [should  be 
Queen],  or  ten  men  and  two  Kings  -one  on  each  side;  sometimes  only 
one  on  the  side.  It  appears  that  these  differences  probably  come  from 
our  game,  especially  the  increased  capturing  power  of  a  King  - 
sometimes  with  a  chess  bishop-like  move  -  came  about  in  Spain  after 
the  English  had  learned  the  game  as  they  know  it  now,  but  before 
1500.

Ludus  Rebellionis  C. 

Manuscript  of  Cesena  (1502)  and  Perugia,  (1502) 


Thanks  to  a  thorough  investigation  of  the  chess  manuscripts 
from  Perugia  and  Cesena  (written  around  1502190)  Garzon 
found  that  the  Manuscript  of  Perugia  was  written  88  years 
earlier  than  all  draughts  historians  had  thought!  This  is  rather 
important  since  most  draughts  historians  thought  that  this 
manuscript  was  from  1590.  Garzon  also  published  various 
diagrams  of  a  game  that  Francesh  Vicent  called  Ludus 
rebellionis.  Among  them  we  see  a  game  called  Ludus 
Rebellionis  C.  We  see  on  the  board  published  here  before  that 
Vicent  is  trying  to  fill  the  board  -  as  in  Alquerque  12  -  with  16 

190  Personal  communication  from  Jose  Antonio  Garzon  Roger  (3  July,  2011): 
“Currently,  due  to  my  new  investigations,  I  have  the  certainty  that  the 
common  part  of  both  manuscripts  is  contemporary  and  was  produced  c. 
1502”.

pawns  for  each  player,  but  that  at  the  same  time  he  is  placing 
two  strong  pieces  on  each  side  of  the  board  -  one  of  the  Dama 
(D=Queen)  and  Rey  (R=King).  Unfortunately  Vicent  did  not 
give  us  the  rule  of  this  new  game.

5.2.4  Rodrigo  Caro 


Rodrigo  Caro  (1573-1647)  was  a  poet,  historian,  lawyer  and 
Catholic  priest  of  the  Spanish  Golden  Age. 


Rodrigo  Caro  painted  by  Francisco  Pacheco 


He  studied  canons  at  the  University  of  Osuna,  where  he  enrolled 
in  1590,  and  from  1594  in  Seville,  from  where  he  graduated  in 
1596.  After  his  father’s  death  he  was  picked  up  by  his  uncle 
Juan  Diaz  Caro,  who  lived  in  Sevilla.  Caro  was  an  ecclesiastical 
lawyer  between  1596  and  1620,  and  had  no  shortage  of  work,  as 


-  105  - 


he  attended  seven  lawsuits  a  year  during  that  period.  He 
supported  his  mother  and  eight  brothers  and  still  did  not  receive 
the  protection  of  the  Duke  of  Alcala  who  was  to  be  his  patron  in 
future.  He  was  ordained  priest  at  the  latest  in  1598  and  received 
an  ecclesiastical  benefice  in  the  parish  of  Santa  Maria  de  Utrera. 
He  managed  to  be  named  the  lawyer  of  the  city  council  of  his 
village  and  in  1619  began  working  as  a  censor  of  books.  He  was 
general  inspector  of  the  archdiocese  and  in  June  1627  moved  to 
Seville  where  he  also  served  as  probate  judge.  Other 
commissions  of  the  archbishopric  caused  him  various 
bitternesses  and  a  short  exile  to  Portugal.  In  1645  he  resigned 
from  his  chaplaincy  by  not  being  able  to  attend  it  due  to  a 
stomach  illness  that  became  worse  by  the  time.  He  died  two 
years  later  at  74  on  10  August  1647. 

He  maintained  good  relations  with  numerous  authors,  such  as 
Francisco  de  Rioja,  who  delayed  action  on  his  request  for  real 
chaplaincy  and  cargo  as  chronicler;  Francisco  de  Quevedo, 
whom  he  met  on  a  trip  to  Sevilla  with  the  king  in  1624; 
Francisco  Pacheco,  etc.  He  was,  above  all,  an  archaeologist, 
antiquarian,  and  historian;  he  had  a  large  library  of  classics  and 
even  a  small  museum,  and  wrote  in  Latin  as  well  as  in  Castilian. 

Caro  thought  that  Draughts  was  a  very  old  game,  older  than 
chess,  and  that  it  had  two  names:  Latrunculorm  lusus  and  Ludus 
Calculorum  as  we  can  see  hereunder191: 

The  game  was  called  Latrunculorum  Lusus.  Alexadro  ab  Alexandra 
describes  it  in  his  Dias  geniales,  chapter  XXI,  with  these  words: 
«Ludus  Calculorum,  veteribus  praecipius  fuise  traditur,  qui  et  latrones 
dicti  hi  enim  duas  divissi  turmas  erant  colores  dibersi,  quorum  alii 
milites  alii  hostes:  horum  lusus  erat,  ut  turmis  instructis  velunt  qui 
congredi  acie  parabant,  hinc  inde  sub  hostium  imagine  procederent,

Translation: 

The  game  was  called  Latrunculorum  Lusus.  Alexandro  ab  Alexandro 
describes  it  in  his  Dias  geniales,  chapter  XXI,  with  these  words: 

“The  game  of  counters,  which  is  said  to  especially  old,  is  also  called 
robbers.  There  were  different  colours  divided  into  two  teams,  of 
which  one  was  soldiers  and  the  other  enemies:  the  game  was  to  draw 
up  your  teams  as  you  wanted  and  prepare  to  arrange  them  in 
formation,  and  from  there  advance  under  the  enemies’  tokens,  and  a 
predefined  border  where  each  piece  aims  to  advance  to:  so  the  player 
had  to  be  careful  so  that  while  each  [piece]  was  sent  to  invade  the 
border,  the  other  [player’s  piece]  wouldn’t  lie  exposed  in  their 
journey.  And  these  [pieces]  were  also  [made]  from  gemstones.  It  was 
played  by  both  men  and  women,  by  [people  of]  better  or  even  the 
highest  ranks,  and  it  was  an  especially  high  and  celebrated  game. 
Pamedes  advanced  to  an  insurrection  composed  of  [the  other  player’s] 
idle  army  and  met  defeat.”

The  Spanish  Jew  Francesch  Vicent  showed  the  first  diagram  of 
draughts  in  the  Manuscript  of  Cesena  (1502)  and  the  one  of 
Perugia  (1 502) 193 .  The  Italian  historian  Sanvito194  discovered 
that  he  was  in  the  service  of  Lucrecia  Borgia  at  the  court  of 
Ferrara  in  1506  as  teacher  of  chess.

There  is  every  reason  to  believe  that  this  diagram  appears  in  the 
book  of  Francesch  Vicent,  because  practically  all  the  chess 
diagrams  of  the  Manuscript  of  Cesena  and  Perugia  appear  in  the 
lost  book  of  Vicent195  too.  According  to  Friar  Benito  Ribas196 
the  case  of  this  book  is  nothing  else  than  the  “juego  de  las 
damas  o  ajedrez”  (game  of  the  damas  or  chess).  This  striking 
phrase  of  Ribas  is  confusing  draughts  with  chess.  Joseph  Vargas 
Ponce  (1760-1821),  a  known  scholar,  paid  a  visit  to  the 
Monastery  of  Montserrat  in  1799,  an  event  that  was  recorded  by 
Alexandre  Oliver  too.  Vargas  Ponce  described  various  works, 
among  them  the  book  of  Francesh  Vicent: 

Vicente  Francisco,  sobre  el  Juego  de  damas,  en  Valencia,  1  tomo,  4°, 
por  Antonio  Lopez  de  la  Roca. 

Translation: 

Vicente  Francisco,  about  the  draughts  (chess?)  game,  at  Valencia,  1 
Volume,  4°,  by  Antonio  Lopez  de  la  Roca. 

Due  to  the  short  time  available  and  as  the  work  is  written 
in  Valencia,  Varga  may  have  been  confusing  things.  The  fact 
that  he  mentions  that  the  book  discusses  the  game  of  draughts 
could  have  been  motivated  by  a  hurry,  as  he  had  to  quickly  page

through  the  books  and  probably  saw  several  times  the  term  “de 
la  dama”  and  thereafter  a  draughts  diagram  at  the  beginning  or 
end  of  this  book,  such  as  appearing  the  manuscript  of  Cesena 
and  Perugia.  In  the  manuscript  of  Cesena  the  draughts  diagram 
adjoins  the  first  chess  technical  position  and  in  the  one  of 
Perugia  it  is  destined  to  close  the  chess  session199.  It  could  also 
be  possible  that  he  was  still  thinking  in  chess  with  the  term 
“juego  de  damas”. 


5.3.1  Daniel  de  Souter 

Daniel  de  Souter  (1571-1634)  was  bom  in  Vlissingen  (Holland) 
and  in  1614  he  was  priest  in  Kampen.  He  left  this  city  in  August 
1615  to  settle  as  priest  in  Haarlem,  where  he  died  in  1634.

From  his  pen  appeared  the  famous  game  encyclopedia 
Palamedes  in  1617.  Although  he  discusses  the  Greek  and 
Roman  games200  in  the  book,  he  also  mentioned  for  comparison 
the  draughts  game  that  he  saw  played  in  his  time.  Each  player 
had  15  discs  on  the  draughts  board  that  in  this  case  was  not  the 
chessboard,  but  a  checkered  board  of  10x10(1 00  squares). 

caput  XX:  Tabula,  in  qua  latrunculis  ludebatur  apud  veteres,  tota 
lineis  districta,  et  unicuique  calculo  suus  locus  ac  sua  sedes  attributa, 
nec  aliter  hodie  est  apud  nos  Tabula  enim  lusoria  quadraturis 
discoloribus  altematim  positis  distincta  est,  et  in  illis  loculis  quadratis 
locari  solent  calculi.  Atque  hie  ludus  nihil,  aut  parum,  distabat  a 
nostro,  quem  vocamus  Dominarum  ioco,  qui  tamen  triginta  tantum 
calculis  luditur:  quindecim  albis,  et  quindecim  rubeis. 

Translation: 

The  board,  on  which  the  ancients  played  with  pebbles,  is  completely 
subdivided  by  lines  and  each  pebble  has  its  own  place  and  position 
granted,  and  the  board  is  not  different  today  with  us.  The  board  is 
subdivided  into  squares  of  different  colours  which  are  placed 
alternately,  and  one  places  the  pebbles  on  the  squares.  And  this  game 
was  not  different  at  all,  or  was  little  different,  from  our  own  game  that 
we  call  draughts.  However,  this  is  played  with  only  30  discs,  15  white 
and  15  dark  red  ones.

However,  if  we  are  to  believe  Georgius  Mebius  ,  then  the 
work  of  Palamede  was  written  by  Petrus  Schrijverius  (1576- 
1660).

Petrus  Scriverius,  the  Latinized  form  of  Peter  Schrijver  or 
Schryver  (12  January  1576  -  30  April  1660),  was  a  Dutch 
writer  and  scholar  on  the  history  of  Holland  and  Belgium.  He 
was  bom  at  Haarlem,  and  educated  by  Comelis  Schoneus  at  the 
University  of  Leiden,  where  he  formed  a  close  intimacy  with 
Daniel  Heinsius. 


In  1599  he  married  Anna  van  der  Aar,  and  from  1611  to  1613 
he  was  headmaster  of  the  Latin  School  in  Duisburg,  today's 
Landfermann-Gymnasium.  He  belonged  to  the  party  of 
Oldenbarnevelt  and  Grotius,  and  brought  down  the  displeasure 
of  the  government  by  a  copy  of  Latin  verses  in  honor  of  their 
friend,  the  Remonstrant  Leiden  pensionaris  Rombout 
Hoogerbeets.  Scriverius'  poems  were  considered  libelous  and  he 
was  fined  200  guilders.  Most  of  his  life  was  passed  in  Leiden, 
but  in  1650  he  became  blind,  and  the  last  years  of  his  life  were 
spent  in  his  son's  house  at  Oudewater,  where  he  died  in  1660. 


-  113  - 


He  is  best  known  as  a  scholar  by  his  notes  on  Martial,  Ausonius, 
the  Pervigilium  Veneris ;  editions  of  the  poems  of  Joseph  Justus 
Scaliger  (Leiden,  1615),  of  the  De  re  militari  of  Vegetius 
Renatus,  the  tragedies  of  Seneca  (P.  Scriverii  collectanea 
veterum  tragicorum,  1621),  &c.  His  Opera  anecdota, 

philologica,  et  poetica  (Utrecht,  1738)  was  edited  by  A.  H. 
Westerhovius,  and  his  Nederduitsche  Gedichten  (1738)  by  S. 
Dockes. 


5.3.2  Claudius  Salmasius 

Claude  Saumasius  or  Claude  Saumaise  was  a  famous  French 
scholar.  Salmasius  was  bom  in  Semur-en-Auxois  in  Burgundy 
in  1588  and  died  in  Spa  in  1653.  He  studied  in  Paris  and 
Heidelberg  and  was  a  professor  in  Leiden  from  1632. 


Claude  Saumaise 


-114- 


He  was  a  prolific  author  and  textual  critic.  In  1620  Salmasius 
published  Casaubon’s  notes  on  the  Augustan  History  with 
copious  additions  of  his  own.  In  this  Latin  work  Saumaise 
discusses  in  particular  the  Greek  diagrammismos  game202.  After 
citing  a  passage  of  Hesychius,  which  supported  his  description, 
Saumaise  adds  a  useful  note203. 

Hie  ludus  nihil  aut  parum  distabat  a  nostro,  quem  vocamus, 
dominarum  ioco:  qui  triginta  tamen  tantum  calculis  luditur, 
quindecim  albis,  et  quindecim  rubeis.

This  game  leaves  little  or  no  differences  compared  to  our  game, 
which  we  call  the  game  of  dama  (draughts),  however,  played  with 
only  thirty  pieces,  fifteen  white  and  fifteen  red  ones.

5.3.3  Thomas  Hyde 

Thomas  Hyde  was  bom  in  Billingsley,  near  Bridgnorth  in 
Shropshire  in  1636  and  died  in  Oxford  in  1703.  Hyde  was  an 
excellent  classical  scholar,  and  there  was  hardly  an  Eastern 
tongue  accessible  to  foreigners  with  which  he  was  not  familiar. 


Thomas  Hyde 


His  writings  are  the  best  testimony  to  his  mastery  of  Turkish, 
Arabic,  Syriac,  Persian,  Hebrew,  and  Malay.  Hyde  wrote 
several  books,  including  the  first  of  the  two  volumes  of  the 
“Ludis  Orientalibus”.  In  this  book  he  studied  the  origin  of  chess 


-  116- 


and  came  to  the  conclusion  that  the  game  was  invented  in  India. 
In  his  book  he  described  the  draughts  game204.  The  Latin  and 

90S 

Hebrew  texts  were  recently  translated  by  Keats  . 

Cumque  Nomen  Dames  in  Linguis  Europaeis  denotet  dominas,  sunt 
qui  non  debitarunt  hunc  ludum  latine  appellare  dominarum  Jocum; 
quod  profecto  est  Jocus  omnino  ridendus,  dum  illi  Critici  nolunt  extra 
suarum  linguarum  pomoeria  quaerere. 

Translation: 

Since  the  name  “Dames”  means  lady  in  European  languages,  some 
believe  that  this  game  was  called  “the  game  of  ladies”  in  Latin;  and 
this  is  of  course  completely  ridiculous,  since  those  critics  are 
unwilling  to  search  outside  the  sacred  boundaries  of  their  own 
languages.

6  MARRO 


THE  ETYMOLOGY  OF  THE  WORD  MARRO 

The  etymological  dictionary  of  Corominas207  says: 

marrar 

L’acc  "Mena  de  Joe"  <"ludus  lapillis  aciem  effmgeus">  (Belv)  es  la 
que  es  documenta  primer,  i  pot  derivar  tambe  de  "marrar"  en  el  sentit 
de  jugar  exposant-se  a  marrar-la; 

Loose  translation: 

“it  is  the  one  that  was  documented  in  the  first  place,  and  can  also 
derive  from  the  word  ‘marrar’  in  the  sense  of  play,  exposing  to 
surround  her” 


Alcover  mentions  in  his  dictionary: 

Joe  antiq,  semblant  al  de  dames,  del  qual  encara  es  conserva  a  record 
a  Menorca 

Loose  translation: 

“Old  game,  similar  to  checkers,  of  which  there  is  still  a  memory  in 
Menorca”

According  to  Corominas213  Marro  is  a  name  for  different  games 
and  Nebrija  doesn’t  mention  this  word  in  his  dictionary. 
However,  it  does  figure  the  word  Marrar  which  means  “fail 
short”  and  “deviate  from  the  right214”.  For  more  information  on 
the  etymology  of  this  word  we  refer  to  the  work  of  Dr.  Arie  Van 
der  Stoep215. 

The  word  Marro  de  punta  was  the  most  usual  in  the  ordinary 
language  for  the  game  of  checkers  in  the  sixteenth  and 
seventeenth  centuries.  We  found  this  term  in  the  book  of 
checkers  of  1547  by  Antonio  de  Torquemada  ,  in  the  work  of

In  Cataluna  the  escarbunclo  of  Navarra  was  compared  with  the 
marro,  or  three  in  line,  a  children’s  game  which  was  practiced 
over  lines  made  in  the  ground.  In  the  chapters  of  the  First  of  the 
Chrestia  written  between  1379  and  1381  Fray  Francesc 
Eiximenis,  indicates  that  the  shield  of  the  King  of  Navarra  is  ab 
form  of  marro  ab  speres  (=spheres,  in  reference  to  the 
pomelado)  pel  mig  de  les  linyes  del  dit  marro  (in  the  middle  of 
the  lines  of  the  marro).  In  the  heraldic  treaty  that  precedes  the 
roll  of  arms  of  the  Municipal  Library  of  Tolosa  of  the 
Languedoc  Steve  Tamborino  also  writes:

un  elemento  que  en  heraldica  ha  recibido  siempre  el  nombre  de 
escarbunclo,  y  seria  una  discusion  bizantina  debatir  si  se  trata 
de  una  pieza  o  de  una  figura  estilizada.  Deriva  este  termino  del 
latin  carbunculus,  piedra  preciosa;  y  en  la  Edad  Media  se  creia 
que  el  carbunculo  tenia  el  poder  de  irradiar  luz  durante  la  noche 
o  en  la  oscuridad.

What  the  Spaniards  know  as  the  chains  of  Navarra  is  an  element 
that  in  heraldic  has  always  received  the  name  of  escarbunclo, 
and  it  will  take  a  byzantine  discussion  to  debate  if  this  is  a  piece 
or  from  a  stylized  figure.  This  term  comes  from  the  Latin  word 
carbunculus,  gemstone,  and  in  the  middle  ages  it  was  believed

that  the  carbunculo  had  the  power  to  radiate  light  during  the 
night  or  in  the  darkness. 


6.1.2  1591  Pedro  Ruiz  Montero 

The  oldest  book  that  we  found  in  the  libraries  is  the  work  of 
Pedro  Ruiz  Montero221.  He  must  have  been  a  very  good 
checkers  player,  given  that  in  the  manuscript  of  Alonso 
Guerra222,  currently  in  possession  of  Victor  Cantalapiedra 
Martin  in  Valladolid,  Guerra  says  that  Pedro  Ruiz  Montero  had 
the  nickname  The  Marro.  It’s  strange  that  other  authors,  such  as 
Antonio  de  Torquemada,  Lorenzo  Vails,  and  Juan  de  Timoneda 
talk  in  his  book  of  Marro  de  Punta,  while  Pedro  Ruiz  Montero 
briefly  evokes  as  The  Marro  in  his  book.  On  page  24  of  his 
work  we  found  the  next  phrase: 

Otra  que  viene  a  ser  tabla,  aunque  esta  en  el  libro  que  se  imprimio  en 
Valencia  antiguamente,  y  la  pone  ganada,  y  yo  hallo  que  es  tabla  sin 
ningun  remedio  por  lo  que  lo  dare  a  entender. 

Loose  translation: 

Another  that  comes  to  be  a  draw,  although  it  is  in  the  book  that  was 
printed  in  Valencia  long  ago,  and  put  it  as  a  win,  and  I  find  that  is  a 
draw  for  sure,  so  that  I  will  make  it  understood.

The  oldest  final  in  the  history  of  checkers 


Final  moved  to  a  board  of  100  squares 

The  position  in  the  diagram  has  been  played  by  Kruijswijk  on  a 
board  of  100  squares  with  the  next  victory: 


-  126- 


47-42!  With  two  variants: 

I.  46-23;  42-38,  36-41;  15-10  en  3-14.  II.  36-41,  49-32,  41-47; 
32-5  en  3-14! 

Kruijswijk223  attributes  this  position  to  Antonio  de  Torquemada, 
who  is  the  first  author  of  a  checkers  book  of  1547.  It  was 
published  in  Valencia  where  the  first  Spanish  print  was  installed 
in  1474.  Spain  was  the  native  country  where  the  game  of 
checkers  began  to  flourish  with  the  rule  that  was  obligatory  to 
eat.  The  Spanish  game  of  checkers  is  characterized  by  two 
modern  rules:  the  obligatory  jump  to  eat  the  most,  and  the  long 
lady,  according  to  our  famous  historian  and  man  of  knowledge 
of  finals,  K.W.  Kruijswijk. 

Pedro  Ruiz  Montero  says  in  his  book  that  the  position  leads  to  a 
draw,  but  years  later  it  was  proved  that  the  position  was  in  fact  a 
winner  to  the  black  ones.

A  figure  similar  to  this  board  c.  1600  Book  Cam.  Real  de  Fdz 
Oviedo  (ms.  T88,  1870)  147  147  note:  another  says  Nauarra,

the  field  of  gole  vel  sanguino.  (Var.  mas.  E  110:  bears  on  his 
shield  the  marro  or  alquerque  of  the  gold  chains)224. 

This  is  an  indication  that  alquerque  and  marro  were  the  same 
games  over  lines.

this  weapon  looked  like  in  the  past.

6.1.5  1688  Randle  Holme 

A  comprehensive  description  of  the  weapons  used  by  Marros 

99Q 

from  Navarre  is  found  in  Holme’s  book  (1688,  Book  I): 

Chapter  7:  image  on  page  66,  67  and  description  of  page  77 


No.  118 


He  beareth  Argent,  an  Orle  of  Pellets 
chained,  all  fired  to  another  in  fesse 
Gyron-wise.  This  is  born  by  the  name  of 
Nevaire.  This  is  generally  termed  the 
Navarre  Knot,  being  the  Coat  of  that 
Kingdom;  thus  I  have  seen  it  drawn  of  old, 
but  now  it  is  otherwise,  as  you  may  see 
chap.  9,  Nos.  32,  33. 


Chapter  9:  image  on  pages  88,  89  and  description  on  page  91 


He  beareth  Gales  9  Annuletts 
linked  to  each  other  in  form  of  a 
Gyron  (or  Gyron  wise)  Or,  This  by 
the  French  Blazoned  no  otherwise 
than  he  beareth  Navarre  as  being 
the  coat  of  that  Kingdom:  though 
others  term  it  8  Annuletts  in  Orle, 
linked  to  another  in  the  Center, 
and  each  other  Gyron-wise.  This 
Chained  Gyron  belongs  to  the 
Arms  of  the  Kingdom  of  Navarre.

No.  33 


He  beareth  Gules,  a  Gordian 
Knott,  or,  else  thus,  a  double 
Orle  of  Annuletts  linked  to  each 
other,  and  all  to  another  in  the 
Center,  Gyron-Wise;  or  after 
the  French,  the  Navarre  Knot, 
or  the  double  Knott  of  Navarre, 
being  so  born  for  the  coat  of 
Armour  of  that  Kingdom. 


Orle  =  pillow,  signifying  Rest,  Quietness,  and  Content. 

Annulett  =  a  ring,  the  emblem  of  Unity,  Friendship,  and  love 
to  eternity. 

Giron  =  a  lap,  or  the  space  between  the  thighs  called  the 
groin;  the  emblem  of  Unity,  Peace,  and  Concord.

Merelle  = 

Jeu  qu’on  joue  sur  un  tablier  distingue  par  plusieurs  lignes,  avec 
des  dames  ou  autres  marques,  dont  il  s’en  doit  trouver  un 
certain  nombre  en  ligne  droite.  Le  jeu  de  la  merelle  n’a  de  lieu 
que  parmy  les  escoliers.  II  est  fort  ancien,  et  vient  de  marcella 
et  madrellum,  d’ou  on  a  fait  aussi  mareau,  comme  prouve  fort 
bien  Menage.  En  termes  de  Blason,  on  dit  que  les  anciens  Rois 
de  Navarre  depuis  Sanche  le  Fort  ont  porte  pour  Armes  des 
chaisnes  merelees,  qui  representent  des  merelles,  quoy  que

The  weapon  of  Navarre 


Loose  translation: 

Moris  = 

Game  played  on  a  board  divided  along  different  lines,  with 
checkers  or  other  pieces  of  which  one  must  find  a  certain 
amount  on  a  straight  line.  This  game  of  marro  was  played  only 
by  scholars.  It  is  a  very  old  game  and  comes  from  the  words 
marcel  la  and  madrellum,  from  which  derived  the  term  mareau , 
as  Menage  firmly  proves  it.  It  is  stated  in  the  heraldry  that  the 
ancient  kingdom  of  Navarre  Sancho  el  Fuerte  had  chains  in  the 
shape  of  Marro’s  weapons,  analogous  to  the  game  of  marro

6.1.7  1732  The  Authorities'  Dictionary 


In  the  Authorities’  Dictionary  of  1732  we  find  a  child’s  game 
that  is  a  lot  like  our  game  of  marro  de  punta. 

«Marro.  Significa  tambien  un  juego  parecido  al  que  llaman  de  Moros 
y  Christianos,  en  que  puestos  dos  bandos  de  una  parte  y  otra 
encontrados,  dexando  suficiente  campo  en  medio,  salen  de  uno  y  otro 
a  coger  o  tocar  al  contrario:  y  el  arte  consiste  en  huir  el  cuerpo  el  uno 
al  otro,  para  que  no  le  cojan  6  toquen,  retirandose  a  su  bando,  porque 
si  le  tocan  queda  prisionero,  por  lo  que  le  dieron  este  nombre». 

Loose  translation: 

«Moris.  It  is  also  like  a  game  called  Moors  and  Christians  -  Moros  y 
Cristianos  -,  in  which  posts  of  both  sides  found  either  side,  leaving 
enough  room  in  between,  going  to  either  catch  or  touch  the  opponent, 
and  its  point  is  to  run  from  each  other  so  that  they  will  not  get  caught 
or  touched,  retiring  to  his  side,  because  if  one  gets  touched,  one 
becomes  a  prisoner,  so  it  was  given  this  name».

6.2  Marro  transfers  to  the  Chessboard 


The  moris  transferred  from  the  moris  board  to  the  chessboard, 
from  which  comes  the  first  game  of  checkers,  which  for  us  is 
none  other  than  the  game  of  Spanish  checkers.  It  is  not  so 
difficult  to  understand  if  you  look  at  the  illustration  below  in 
which  there  appears  a  silk  rug  which  experts  date  to  the 
fourteenth  century.  This  rug  is  currently  in  possession  of  a 
textile  expert  in  Hong  Kong. 

The  game  board  found  in  the  rug  clearly  has  a  moris  pattern. 
This  recently  discovered  rug  was  made  public  during  the 
meeting  of  leading  historians  of  chess  in  the  Max  Euwe 
Centrum  in  Amsterdam234  (Why Id,  1993:1-9).  Was  it  the 
shatranj?

6.3  Conclusion 


Marro  was  a  Catalan  name  used  for  the  game  of  pieces  in  the 
period  from  1283  to  1700.  Other  historians  often  use  the  tile 
game  expression,  but  this  does  not  seem  right  to  me.  In  Spain  it 
was  played  with  some  kind  of  pawns. 

In  the  kingdom  of  Aragon  any  boardgame  out  of  the  various 
games  that  could  be  played  on  a  striped  board  was  known  as 
Marro.  We  can  bring  here  the  games  of  alquerque-3,  alquerque- 
9,  and  alquerque-12,  which  are  the  equivalent  names  in 
Castilian  for  all  the  various  Marro  games. 

A  noteworthy  fact  is  that  in  Alonso  Guerra’s  manuscript  from 
around  1595  he  refers  to  Pedro  Ruiz  Montero  by  the  nickname 
The  Marro.  This  manuscript  of  Alonso  Guerra  is  in 
possession  of  the  checkers  player  Victor  Cantalapiedra  Martin 
from  Valladolid. 

In  Sicily,  which  belonged  to  the  Kingdom  of  Aragon,  was 
played  a  game  called  Marella  back  then,  which  apparently 
was  a  game  none  other  than  andarraya  practiced  on  lines  or 
stripes,  which  would  probably  later  be  called  just  alquerque. 

Marro  was  sometimes  used  to  refer  to  the  game  of  Marro  de 
Punta  (Checkers).  Marro  is  just  a  generic  name  and  does  not 
allow  defining  a  game.  This  wasn't  taken  into  consideration  by 
Pedro  Ruiz  Montero  in  his  book  title,  but  it  was  by  Lorenzo 


235  GUERRA,  Alonso  (1595/1658).  Libro  para  jugar  a  las  damas, 
compuesto  por  el  Licenciado  Alonso  Guerra,  natural  de  la  Villa  de  Ossuna, 
en  el  Andaluzia.  (written  about  1595),  Reduzido  assimismo  en  este  mesmo 
estilo  por  el  dicho  Ldo  Don  Diego  de  Argomedo.  En  este  ano  de  1658.

Yalls,  Antonio  de  Torquemada,  and  Juan  de  Timoneda.  They  all 
speak  of  Marro  de  Punta.  The  fact  that  Marro  was  used  only  by 
Pedro  Ruiz  Montero  suggests  that  this  was  still  the  old  name  for 
the  game  of  alquerque-12,  as  it  is  reflected  by  King  Alfonso  X 
the  Wise.  After  the  term  Marro  de  Punta  was  used  for  a  game  of 
checkers  on  a  lines  board  (checkerboard)  and  when  it  was 
moved  to  a  chessboard,  the  name  Marro  de  Punta  was  initially 
maintained  until  the  new  name  checkers  became  really  popular.

7.1  Theories  about  the  term  Marro  de  Punta 

To  present  day  this  has  been  said  about  the  term  Marro  de 
Punta: 


7.1.1  1912  Branch 

Marro  de  punta  =  Merrils  on  the  square,  to  distinguish  from 
merrils  on  the  line237. 


7.1.2  1913  Murray

7.1.3  1952  Murray 

I  have  already  shown  that  the  chequered  chessboard  invited  the 
transfer  of  other  games  on  lined  boards  to  the  cells  of  one  colour 
on  the  chessboard239.  This  view  is  supported  by  the  use  of 
marella  for  draughts  in  Sicily240  and  of  Marro  de  punta  in 
Catalonia  and  Spain,  which  survived  in  vulgar  use  until  as  late 
as  1650241. 


7.1.4  Kruijswijk 

In  middeleeuws  Latijn  werd  de  bordruit  (van  het  schaakbord)  en 
het  bordpunt  (van  het  lijnenbord)  met  diverse  termen  aangeduid, 
t.w.  punctus,  punctum,  tabula,  domus,  campus,  casa, 
quadrus,  locus  en  sedes.  Van  al  deze  termen  waren  punctus 
(met  als  meervoud  puncti)  en  punctum  (met  als  meervoud 
puncta)  het  meest  verbreid.  De  Spaanse  vorm  punta 
(meervoud)  is  afkomstig  uit  het  Catalaanse  taalgebied  en  niet  uit 
het  Kastiliaans-Spaans,  waarin  de  voorkeur  is  uitgegaan  naar  de 
term  casa.  Het  Spaanse  damspel  is  tot  ontwikkeling  en  bloei 
gekomen  in  het  Catalaanse  taalgebied  met  Valencia  als  centrum. 
Aangezien  het  alquerquebord,  dat  is  samengesteld  uit  vier 
kleine  molenborden,  als  een  gecompliceerd  molenbord  werd 
beschouwd,  viel  het  alquerque-spel  onder  de  verzamelnaam  van 
de  molenspelen,  die  in  het  Catalaanse  taalgebied  marro  werden

genoemd.  Dit  waren  louter  lijnenbordspelen,  zodat  de 
toevoeging  de  punta  betrekking  moet  hebben  op  de  ruiten  van 
het  schaakbord  en  niet  op  de  punten  van  het  lijnenbord. 
Dienovereenkomstig  moet  de  damspelbenaming  marro  de  punta 
letterlijk  betekenen:  molenbordspel  op  ruiten.  Als  synoniem  van 
damas  kan  hiermee  niet  anders  bedoeld  zijn  dat  het  tot  damspel 
getransformeerde  alquerquespel  op  de  velden  van  het  Europese 
schaakbord242. 

Loose  translation: 

In  Medieval  Latin  it  was  indicated  with  the  term  box  board 
(chessboard)  and  the  intersection  (of  the  panel  lines)  with 
various  terms,  namely  punctus,  punctum,  tabula,  domus, 
campus,  house,  Quadras,  locus  in  offices.  Of  all  these  terms 
punctus  (in  plural  Puncti )  and  punctum  (in  plural  puncta)  were 
the  most  common.  The  Spanish  spelling  punta  is  native  to  the 
region  of  the  Catalan  language  and  not  of  the  Castilian  regional 
use  where  house  was  the  preferred  term.  The  game  of  checkers 
in  Spain  developed  and  flourished  in  the  Catalan  linguistic 
region  with  Valencia  as  his  center.  As  the  board  of  alquerque 
(of  12),  consisting  of  four  panels  of  alquerque  of  3,  was 
considered  a  complex  board  of  alquerque,  the  game  of 
alquerque  (of  12)  was  cataloged  under  the  collective  name 
games  of  alquerque  and,  in  the  Catalan  linguistic  region,  under 
the  collective  name  of  marro.  These  were  only  boards  of  lines, 
but  the  addition  of  the  expression  de  punta  should  refer  to  the 
squares  of  chess  and  not  to  the  point  of  lines  of  the  board.  Thus 
the  name  of  marro  de  punta  literally  meant  alquerque  game  on 
squares.

The  synonym  of  damas  is  thus  nothing  else  than  the  alquerque 
game  transformed  to  checkers  on  the  squares  of  the  European 
chessboard. 


7.1.5  1981  Dr.  A.  van  der  Stoep 

Punto  meant  square  of  the  chessboard,  so  Marro  de  punta  may 
be  interpreted  literally  as  alquerque  on  a  chequered  board243. 


7.2  De  Punta  means  diagonally 

In  1993  I  proposed  to  Rob  Jansen  to  conduct  a  study  on  the 
meaning  of  the  Marro  de  Punta  proposition.  At  first  Jansen  said 
that  they  knew  enough  about  the  meaning  of  these  words. 
Fortunately  he  later  agreed  with  my  idea  of  looking  for  more 
and  the  data  he  obtained  were  instrumental  in  breaking  down 
traditional  theories  of  the  afore-mentioned  historians.  Even  in 
1993  after  gathering  some  data  Jansen  already  wondered  if  it 
was  not  more  logical  to  translate  the  word  punta  fin  Marro  de 
Punta)  by  the  idea  above  angle  or  angle  above  cusps  or 
something  similar.  In  the  game  of  alquerque  you  can  move  in  all 
directions  in  contrast  to  the  new  Marro  de  Punta  where  the 
pieces  only  move  diagonally  forward. 

Later  Jansen  perceived  in  the  words  Marro  de  Punta  a  sense  of 
a  hobby  played  above  points  of  the  intersection,  but  I  found  that 
description  too  limited,  because  the  game  of  alquerque  of  12 
was  also  played  on  intersection  points  (of  lines).  My  opinion 
was  that  Marro  de  Punta  had  to  be  something  different  from  all 
the  games  of  alquerque  or  marro.  I  liked  more  his  other  idea  of  a 
diagonal  game.  While  it  was  taking  as  a  starting  point  the  fact 


243  STOEP,  Arie  van  der  (1984).  A  history  of  draughts,  Rockanje,  p.  81. 


-  142  - 


that  all  games  of  Marro,  including  Marro  de  Punta,  were 
hobbies  where  they  played  on  lines  and  intersections,  the  words 
de  punta  seem  to  me  to  refer  to  a  game  in  diagonal  direction. 
But  at  that  time  we  had  no  documentary  evidence  that  could  test 
our  hypothesis  true.  This  possibility  could  finally  be  checked 
with  Jansen’s  discovery  of  a  Catalan  translation  in  the  fifteenth 
century  of  the  famous  chess  book  of  Jacobus  de  Cessolis!  De 
punta  did  not  mean  anything  other  than  diagonal.  Here  we  have 
a  proof  that  the  Spanish  checkers  game  of  Marro  de  Punta  had 
terms  that  were  also  daily  used  in  the  Spanish  world  of  chess! 


7.2.1  Etymology  of  the  word  Marro 

For  more  information  about  the  etymology  of  this  word  we  refer 
to  the  chapter  on  marro  of  the  outstanding  book  of  checkers 
history  by  Dr.  A.  Van  der  Stoep244. 

7.2.2  The  etymology  of  Punta  and  Punto 

In  current  Castilian  we  know  two  words  that  sound  almost  the 
same:  punto  en  punta. 

Most  people  are  likely  to  translate  the  word  punta  within  the 
group  of  words  marro  de  punta  as  the  Latin  word  punctum  and 
reflect  it  later  as  the  checkers  game  on  boxes  or  squares.  But  we 
have  in  Castilian  two  almost  identical  terms  and  that’s  why  the 
game  of  marro  de  punta  deserves  more  detailed  explanation. 


7.2.2. 1  Punto 

Punto  derived  from  the  Latin  word  punctum  and  means 
extreme.  The  first  evidence  of  this  word  is  found  in  the  time  of

"El  Cid"  in  the  eleventh  century  .  But  the  dictionary  of  the 
great  Antonio  de  Nebrija  says  little  about  the  word  punto  and 
more  about  the  word  punta. 

1.2.2.2  Punta 

Punta  is  a  Spanish  word,  also  bom  in  the  eleventh  century  and 
means  among  other  things  the  end  of  something,  especially  if  it 
is  sharp.  It  also  means  tip,  peak,  the  point  of  a  bayonet  .  In  the 
dictionary  of  Antonio  de  Nebrija248  we  found  tip,  acute  thing. 
We  also  can’t  ignore  that  punta  is  used  as  an  end  point  formed 
by  an  angle  (Dictionary  of  Authorities,  1732).  In  Castilian  de 
punta  a  punta  loosely  translated  means  from  end  to  end.  It 
should  be  known  that  punta  figuratively  means  the  same  as 
acuity249.  Then  we  also  understand  the  term  quick  wit.  The  best 
explanation  of  the  word  punta  is: 

«By  extension  is  the  end  of  something  that  ends  forming  an 
angle:  as  the  tip  of  the  toe,  the  tip  of  the  bench.  Lat.  Cuspis, 
Angulus250».  (Dictionary  of  Authorities,  1732)

7.2.3  The  Spanish  chess  literature  before  1500 

If  the  books  of  checkers  do  not  clarify  what  the  term  Marro  de 
Punta  means,  then  the  chess  books  before  the  fifteenth  century 
must  give  us  the  solution  and  so  we  have  carefully  studied  the 
Valencian  word  punt  and  Spanish  words  punto,  postpunta,  and 
punta. 

7.2.3.1  Punt 

This  Valencian  Word  is  contained  in  the  manuscript  of  Scachs 
d'amor251,  written  by  Narcis  Vinyoles  around  1475,  as  we  see: 

Lo  Rey  juga  hun  punt  lo  seu  Peo. 

(Castilian:  The  King  moves  a  point  [step] 


Juga  lo  Cavall  de  Dama  a  dos  puts  de  Dama  (read  puts  = 
punts) 

(Castilian:  Play  the  horse  of  lady  at  two  points  of  the  lady) 


Lo  Rey  se  cobre  del  Cavall,  a  dos  punts  de  Dama 

(Castilian:  The  King  covers  of  the  horse,  at  two  points  of  Lady) 
Paluzie  and  Lucena  wrote  extensively  on  this  manuscript.  It 
was  also  addressed  by  Miquel  and  Planas253  and  Ribelles254 
(1915:275-297).

The  Yalencian  word  (Aragon)  punt  then  also  had  the  meaning 
of  box  in  the  tenth  century.  But  had  this  also  been  the  case 
before  that  date?  It  seemed  much  more  likely  that  the  word 
punt  was  used  for  intersections  that  were  formed  to  play  the 
game  on  a  board  of  lines. 


The  Alquerque-12  Game  in  1283 


-  147  - 


In  the  adjacent  image  we  can  see  the  Alquerque-12  board  where 
little  squares  are  shown  (meaning  points);  over  them  the  pawns 
were  placed  and  their  movement  happened. 

No  matter  what  it  actually  was,  the  translation  for  the  Catalan 
and  Valencian  word  punt  into  Spanish  is  still  punto  (point)  and 
not  punta  (tip). 


7. 2.3.2  Point  (Punto) 

This  word  was  used  in  Lucena’s  chess  book  (1497)  and  in 
this  case  its  meaning  was  not  referring  to  box  or  square,  since 
for  such  purpose  the  word  was  house  (Sp.  casa),  but  meaning 
point  (In  Latin  punctum). 

On  the  other  hand,  in  the  old  Valencian  text  Scachs  d’amor  we 
can  see  how  the  Catalan  Word  punt  was  used  to  mean  box  or 
square.  It  must  be  said  that  in  the  fifteenth  century  people  from 
Catalonia  spoke  Catalan  as  well  as  people  from  Valencia  and 
the  Balearic  Islands.  Today  the  Valencian  language  is  different, 
but  its  differences  from  the  Catalan  tongue  are  very  few.  Going 
back  to  the  Catalan  word  punt,  its  meaning  in  Castile  is  also 
point  and  not  tip. 

That  is  the  reason  why  when  referring  to  the  squares  Marro  de 
punto  (Alquerque)  was  the  expected  term  and  not  Marro  de 
punta,  the  term  that  we  know.  Many  historians  say  that 
Alquerque  is  nothing  but  a  checkers  game  over  boxes,  as  the 
chessboard.  But  it  seems  that  for  etymological  reasons  there  are 
clear  differences,  because  if  not,  the  name  of  the  game  would  be 
Marro  de  punto.

1.2.3.3  Postpunta 

In  the  book  by  Alfonso  X  The  Wise  (1283/1987)  the  orbit  of 
action  and  the  movements  of  the  different  chess  pieces  are 
shown  in  a  separate  chapter  and  the  word  postpunta  is  used, 
referring  to  the  bishop’s  movement. 


Los  alfiles  saltan  a  tres  casas  en  pospunta  a  semejan9a  de  los 
elefantes  que  traien  entonce  los  reyes,... 

Loose  translation: 


-  The  bishops  jumping  over  three  squares  go  in  oblique 
direction,  like  the  elephants,  which  were  brought  by  the  Kings, 


King  Alfonso  X  The  Wise 


Also  here  (Alfonso,  1283/1987:245) 

E  si  tomando  las  casas  firiere  el  uno  al  otro  una  tabla  o  mas, 
develas  tomar,  no  a  la  quadra  quel  esta  en  derecho  ni  a  la  casa 
quel  esta  de  lado,  mas  a  la  quel  esta  en  pospunta  e  desque  las 
metiere  en  esta  quadra,.. 

Loose  translation: 


-  150- 


And  when  at  jumping  over  squares,  one  player  captures  one  or 
more  pieces,  he  should  capture  the  conquest  pieces,  not  over 
straight  squares,  nor  over  lateral  squares,  but  over  the  opposite 
oblique  squares. 


Here  we  can  see  a  clear  difference  between  the  words  houses  or 
quadras  (both  meaning  boxes)  and  the  word  pospunta  that  can 
be  loosely  translated  as  obliquely  up  angle  or  in  oblique  up 
direction.

7.2.4  Foreign  expressions  related  to  ‘Tip’ 

The  Spanish  expressions  pospunta  or  postpunta  are  the  closest 
in  meaning  to  the  word  tip.  Postpunta  dates  from  1283. 
Therefore  in  order  to  obtain  a  better  conception  of  postpunta,  as 
well  as  punta  it  is  worth  focusing  on  other  medieval  translations 
related  to  chess  literature  written  overseas. 

7.2.4. 1  German  translations 

Two  texts  from  medieval  German  translations  are  shown  below:

Vom  Gange  der  Alten

Loose  translation: 

About  the  movement  of  the  former  bishops. 

It  must  also  be  noted  that  the  old  bishops  moved  on  the 
chessboard  diagonally  from  their  own  square  to  the  third  square; 
the  White  bishops  through  the  White  squares  and  the  Black 
bishops  through  the  black  squares.  Their  diagonal  movement 
means  they  shine  while  moving  forward  safely.

farther,  over  the  angles  (diagonally).

From  a  thesis  by  G.H.  v.  Schaick  Avelingh  dated  1912  we 
take  three  references  about  the  diagonal  direction  of  chess 
pieces.  This  thesis  is  a  Dutch  translation  from  Jacobus  de 
Cessolis  taken  from  a  manuscript  printed  in  1473  in  Utrecht 
with  the  title: 

Liber  de  moribus  hominum  et  officiis  nobilium  ac  Popularium 
super  ludo  scacchorum.

dat  derde  velt,  voor  den  ackerman  gaen  staen". 

Loose  Translation: 

About  the  Bishop 

And  that  is  why  the  former  bishop  from  the  right  side  must  take 
place  from  its  own  square  first,  diagonally,  to  the  right,  in  the 
third  square  and  in  front  of  the  pawn.

-  About  the  Rook: 

They  can  move  widely  in  a  straight  line,  like  a  King  through  the 
kingdom,  taking  place  in  a  white  or  a  black  square  as  well.  And 
if  they  are  in  the  middle  of  the  board,  they  can  move  vertically 
forward  or  backward;  horizontally,  to  the  left,  or  to  the  right,  but 
never  in  a  diagonal  way. 


-  Over  de  pionnen:  (p.  159/160) 

Altoos  zullen  si  recht  wt  gaen  zonder  wederkeren,  het  en  si,  dat 
van  horen  vianden  hem  enich  moetede,  die  horen  heer  of  hem 
scaden  wilden.  Die  zullen  si  over  hoecke  vangen  of  dootslaen. 

Loose  Translation: 

About  the  Pawns: 

They  always  have  to  move  vertically  without  going  back,  except 
when  they  face  their  enemies  wanting  to  harm  them.  These  must 
be  captured  diagonally  or  killed. 


An  English  translation  from  1475  gives  us  the  following  information: 

The  yssuynge  of  the  Alphyn  (Caxton,  1474) 

“And  ye  shall  understande  that  the  alphyn  goth  alleway  comerwyse 
frd  the  thirde  poynt  to  the  thirde  poynt  kepynge  all  way  his  owne 
siege/  For  yf  he  be  black/  he  goth  all  way  black  /  and  yf  he  be  whyte 
he  goth  alleway  whyte.  The  yssue  or  goynge  cornerly  or  angularly 
signefieth  cautele  or  subtylyte/  which  iuges  ought  to  haue”. 


With  this  text  it  makes  sense  to  translate  the  game  of  Marro  de 
Punta  with  special  reference  to  the  words  "diagonal"  or  "over 
cusps".  In  alquerque  of  12  one  can  move  in  all  directions, 


-  154- 


contrary  to  the  new  game  of  Marro  de  Punta,  in  which  pawns 
can  only  move  diagonally. 

For  the  damista  nation  of  Friesland  it  is  also  interesting  to  know 
that  the  words  Overhoeks  (Diagonal)  and  over  alien  (Above  all 
....)  come  from  medieval  times. 


Jacobus  de  Cessolis 


The  most  splendid  proof  was  undoubtedly  the  source  found  by 
Rob  Jansen  in  1995,  which  contains  the  words  de  punta.  This 
was  the  case  of  a  fifteenth-century  Catalan  translation  of  a  Latin 
chess  manuscript  made  by  Jacobus  de  Cessolis  .  (Bofarull, 
1902):

Bofarull,  Barcelona.

p.  1 1 1  Del  moviment  dels  pehons:

adversaris  los  contrasten 

Loose  translation: 

(...)  they  could  capture  "de  punta  -as  a  tip-"  (oblique),  because 
for  that  their  adversaries  contrast  them 


p.  1 1 1  Del  moviment  dels  Rochs: 

( . )  E  sabedora  cosa  es  que  los  Rochs  null  temps  no  van  de

Loose  translation: 

(...)  It  is  known  that  towers  cannot  move  as  a  tip  (oblique),  but 
in  a  straight  line  (either  to  go  forward  or  backward) 


7.2.5  Points,  intersections,  and  crosses 

There  are  other  references  about  points ,  which  should  be  talked 
about  here.  Including  those  found  in  the  image  of  the  chess- 
tables  board  .  This  board  from  the  sixteenth  century  is 
exposed  in  the  museum  of  industrial  art  in  Vienna.  Here  we  can 
find  points  in  the  white  squares.  Apparently  in  those  days  not 
only  in  Spain  but  also  in  other  countries  it  was  mainly  played  on 
white  squares  for  reasons  of  lack  of  light.  It's  only  from  the 
nineteenth  century  that  this  rule  was  changed  to  playing  in  the 


260  stoep5  Arie  van  der  (1984).  A  history  of  draughts,  Rockanje,  p.  40.

black  boxes,  so  it  can  be  justified  that  in  some  countries  the 
long  diagonal  is  on  the  right  side  of  the  board  while  in  other 
countries  it's  on  the  left. 


Even  today  we 
find  in  Spain  an 
ornately  decor¬ 
ated  board  of 
chess  or  draughts 
where  there  are, 
in  the  beautiful 
white  squares, 

some  decorated 
points,  which 
occupy  at  least 
30%  of  the  white 
boxes.

and  Wilckens  .  On  the  other  things,  going  back  to  the  Vienna 
board  it  seems  that  the  great  diagonal  is  to  the  left  for  the  white 
boxes  and  to  the  right  for  the  black  boxes. 

Therefore  it  seems  that  the  ladies  -  queens  -  were  played  with 
the  big  diagonal  to  the  left.  But  as  mentioned  above,  the  points 
only  refer  to  the  diagonal  direction  of  Marro  de  punta.  If  the 
points  really  had  to  do  with  the  squares,  then  the  game  should 
have  been  called  Marro  de  punta. 

What  are  the  odds  that  can  be  in  a  game  that  uses  the  expression 
punta  -  tipi 

1.  With  the  game  of  Marro  de  punta  it  was  intended  to  describe 
a  game  where  acute  points  were  used  in  the  direction  of 
intersection  points. 

2.  The  game  of  Marro  de  punta  was  used  to  refer  to  a  game,  in 
which  the  direction  was  diagonal  (towards  an  end). 

3.  Marro  de  punta  wanted  to  express  a  reference  to  a  game  with 
the  generic  name  Marro  in  the  sense  of  ingenuity  acuteness. 


As  the  term  ingenuity  is  found  in  the  title  of  the  first  book  of 
checkers,  it  is  logical  to  assume  that  the  term  punta  (tip)  did  not 
refer  to  the  acuteness.  So  we  are  only  left  with  the  first  two 
possibilities.

Alquerque  3  Alquerque  9  Alquerque-12 

But  were  there  any  games  that  had  to  do  with  acute  points  in  the 
late  sixteenth  century?  Well,  yes,  they  really  existed!  Different 
alquerque  games  were  played,  which  were  already  described  in 
the  book  of  Alfonso  X  The  Wise :  Alquerque  of  three,  alquerque 
of  nine,  and  alquerque  of  twelve. 


7.2.5.1  Andarraya 

But  then  there  was  another  game  that  was  played  over  stripes 
and  with  acute  points  -  andarraya.  Also,  in  this  game  a  pawn 
was  placed  in  the  four  comers  of  a  certain  stripe  within  the  same 
board  and  at  the  two  ends  when  the  pawns  were  on  the  verge  of 
it.  But  with  the  term  Marro  de  punta  they  wanted  to  reflect  a 
game  played  differently  than  other  alquerque  games.  Therefore 
playing  in  acute  points  or  intersection  points  could  never  have 
been  a  complete  reflection  of  the  game  of  Marro  de  punta. 
Then  it's  appropriate  to  think  that  this  is  a  game  of  diagonal 
direction. 


-  159- 


Andarraya 


More  interesting  and  much  more  logical  seems  the  board  of  Jan 
van  Leiden266  which  apparently  dates  back  around  the  year 
1500  .  Here  the  term  of  the  board  game  Marro  de  Punta  is 

more  detailed.  We  see  on  the  board,  left  and  right,  the  real 
meaning  of  the  fact  explained  earlier  that  four  stripes  in  the 
game  of  andarraya  formed  the  end  on  which  was  then  placed  a 
pawn.  These  crosses  indicated  the  diagonal  direction  on  the 
chessboard,  as  also  happened  in  the  game  of  andarraya.

Jan  van  Leiden 


7. 2.5.2  Jan  van  Leiden 

Jan  van  Leiden  (February  2,  1509  -  January  22,  1536),  was  an 
Anabaptist  leader  from  Leiden,  in  the  Holy  Roman  Empire's 
County  of  Holland.  In  1533  he  moved  to  Munster,  the  capital 
city  of  the  Holy  Roman  Empire's  Prince-Bishopric  of  Munster, 
where  he  became  an  influential  prophet  and  a  leader  of  the 
Munster  Rebellion.  In  1535,  the  insurrection  was  suppressed 
after  a  siege  of  the  fortified  city,  and  John  was  captured, 
tortured  and  executed. 


It  seems  as  if  they  wanted  to  indicate  on  this  board  of  Jan  van 
Leiden  that  this  was  the  new  game  of  andarraya  and  that  it  could 
now  be  played  on  a  chessboard,  instead  of  the  old  board  of 
stripes.  It  is  curious  that  here  not  all  boxes  have  points  and  that 
the  black  squares  already  have  the  right  diagonal,  as  in  the 
Spanish  game  of  checkers. 


-  161  - 


Checkerboard  Jan  van  Leiden 


We  get  a  much  better  understanding  of  the  ancient  game  of 
andarraya  transferred  to  a  chessboard,  if  we  look  at  the 
Checkerboard  of  1724268. 

If  we  forget  that  this  is  a  board  of  100  squares,  we  understand 
immediately  what  the  game  of  andarraya  was  like  in  antiquity. 
Also  in  this  panel  we  see  the  progress  of  the  parts  and  have  a 
game  of  streaks.  Moreover,  here  the  boxes  where  we  play  are 
white  with  dots,  and  the  great  diagonal  is  on  the  right,  as  in  the 
Spanish  game.  A  characteristic  of  this  game  is  that  if  we  ignore 
the  stripes,  we  are  left  with  the  points  in  the  boxes;  that  is  the 
case  of  the  chessboard  of  Vienna  mentioned  mentioned 
earlierier269.

The  term  andarraya  was  already  known  in  Castilla  in  the 
fifteenth  century,  but  in  the  same  century  we  can’t  find  any 
information  in  the  crown  of  Aragon  about  the  game  of  Marro  de 
punta.  This  happens  in  the  sixteenth  century.  Therefore  it 
remains  a  mystery  whether  the  game  of  andarraya270,  is  played 
in  1495  on  the  same  board  of  lines  and  then  obtains  the  name  of 
Marro  de  Punta,  or  if  the  chessboard  was  used  for  the  game  of 
andarraya,  receiving  the  name  Marro  de  Punta.

At  the  moment  I  take  the  hypothesis  that  Marro  de  Punta 
initially  had  the  same  diagonal  line  board  as  the  game  of 
andarraya. 


Elio  Antonio  de  Nebrija 

An  image  of  the  sixteenth  century  is  preserved  of  the  famous 
Elio  Antonio  de  Nebrija,  who  in  his  1495  dictionary  cites  the 
term  game  of  andarraya  with  NOVUM  (new). 


-  164- 


Maybe  it's  a  coincidence  that  we  find  a  nuanced  floor  in  the 
adjacent  image  and  that  above  them  appear  drawings  of  crosses 
in  diagonal  direction.  Maybe  it  was  something  that  was  used  in 
those  years. 

Nebrija  (1444-1522)  was  a  prominent  Spanish  humanist  who 
was  appointed  professor  of  the  Latin  language  at  the  University 
of  Salamanca  and  later  in  Alcala  de  Henares.  He  was  the  author 
of  several  dictionaries  unmatched  by  any  of  his  contemporaries. 


7.3  Spanish  books  with  the  term  of  Marro  de 
punta 

Spanish  books  on  checkers  bearing  the  term  Marro  de  Punta 
come  from  the  following  authors:  Antonio  de  Torquemada271, 
Juan  de  Timoneda  ,  and  Lorenzo  Vails  .  It  is  curious  that  the 
book  of  checkers  of  Pedro  Ruiz  Montero  only  carries  the  term 
of  Marro,  which  is  otherwise  proof  that  the  checkers  game 
originated  from  the  game  of  Marro.  The  game  of  Marro  was  the 
Aragonese  name  for  the  Castilian  game  of  alquerque.  The 
checkers  game  described  in  these  books  is  played  on  a 
chessboard

7.4  The  pieces  in  marro  de  punta 


In  the  game  of  Marro  de  Punta  the  same  pieces  were 
employed  as  those  of  Alquerque  of  12.  They  were  called 
trebejos  at  the  time  of  King  Alfonso  X  the  Wise.  As  The  King 
indicated  at  that  time,  the  pieces  were  similar  to  the  pawns  in 
chess.  The  same  pieces  were  employed  in  Marro  de  Punta,  but 
instead  of  trebejo  the  word  Pawn  was  used.  The  name  of  the 
chess  piece  was  used  in  this  way  in  Marro  the  Punta  in  Spain.

Initial  Position  in  the  Juan  de  Timoneda’s  Checkers  book,  1635 


In  Juan  de  Timoneda's  book  from  1550  or  even  earlier  there  are 
many  checkers  diagrams.  In  one  of  them  we  can  see  the  initial 
position  of  the  pieces  or  pawns.  Contrary  to  what  happened  in 
other  countries  of  Spain's,  the  game  was  played  with  pawns  for 
a  long  time.  Proof  of  that  are  the  various  dictionaries  as  well  as 


-  166- 


an  illustration  which  can  be  found  in  the  Checkers  Game  Book 
by  Joseph  Carlos  Garcez275  from  1684.  For  how  long  these 
chess  pieces  were  used  to  play  checkers  in  Spain  is  still  a 
mystery.  The  pawns  were  probably  used  until  1700  on  the 
alquerque  board  and  the  chessboard  as  well  to  play  checkers. 
The  French  influence  over  the  use  of  chips  came  gradually  and  I 
suppose  it  was  crucial  from  1700.  Whatever  the  process  was,  in 
Spanish  checkers  literature  the  name  for  the  chip  is  Pawn.

Checkers  Book  by  Juan  de  Timoneda,  1635 


-  170- 


The  pieces  in  the  different  checkers  games:  andarraia, 
alquerque,  and  checkers  resulted  in  a  great  deal  of  confusion 
overseas,  since  the  translated  name  given  to  it  was  Chess. 


For  instance,  we  see  in  the  Arnaldo  de  la  Porte  dictionary276: 
Spanish:  Flemish: 

Axedrez  schaek-spel 

Alquerque  schaek-spel  (it  is  translated  as  Chess  too) 

Andaraia  seker  schaek-spel  (certain  Chess  game) 

Flemish:  Spanish: 

Schaek-schijve  pieqa  de  alquerque  (Flemish:  Chess  piece) 
Damespel  juego  de  axedres  o  de  damas 

(Checkers  game  is  expected  here) 

Schaek-spel  juego  de  damas,  tablas 

(Chess  game  is  expected  here) 

As  we  can  see,  its  characteristics  were  related  to  as  many  as 
four  games;  because  of  the  usage  of  Pawns  it  was  erroneoulsly 
catalogued  as  a  chess  game,  for  at  least  three  games:  checkers, 
andarraia,  and  alquerque,  and  chess.  Three  of  these  games  were 
known  as  checkers’  variations.  And  all  this  without  mention  of 
Marro  de  Punta,  which  was  also  played  with  chess  pawns.

7.5  Conclusion 


We  can  have  doubts  about  the  argument  that  Marro  the  Punta 
refers  to  just  one  game  over  squares.  Marro,  a  Catalan  word 
which  is  barely  used  today,  was  described  many  times  between 
the  fourteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries  as  a  generic  name  for 
similar  board  games.  It  is  highly  likely  that  its  omission  in  the 
title  of  Torquemada’s  book  was  intentional,  since  this  was  a 
cleverness  game  and  in  the  Torquemada  book  appeared  “El 
Ingenio”,  indicating  similar  things.  This  game  had  nothing  to  do 
with  a  tip  game277  which  used  intersection  crosses  which  fitted 
in  many  games.  With  the  term  Marro  de  Punta  the  idea  was 
precisely  to  separate  it  from  the  others  and  make  clear  in  the 
sixteenth  century  that  it  was  a  new  Marro  Game  with  a 
determined  direction.  The  name  Marro  de  Punta  could  be 
developed  gradually  after  1495  as  a  Valencian  name  for  the  new 
andarraya  game  meaning  pawns  settled  in  the  four  strips 
extremes,  are  coronated  to  the  new  powerful  lady  (dama)279, 
played  in  a  diagonal  direction  over  the  old  andarraya  board 
with  diagonal  strips. 

However,  if  we  value  all  the  data,  the  most  logical  thought  is 
that  Marro  de  Punta  did  not  refer  to  anything  but  andarraya 
practiced  over  a  stripped  board,  with  exclusive  diagonal 
direction  movement,  and  with  the  use  of  the  new  powerful  lady.

In  this  case  the  term  Marro  had  the  meaning  of  a  game  practiced 
over  strips  and  intersection  crosses  while  the  Punta  term  had 
the  sense  of  a  diagonal  direction.  Therefore  Marro  de  Punta  was 
a  stripped  diagonal  game  which  later  changed  to  a  chessboard 
and  during  the  first  years  of  introduction  kept  its  name.  It  was 
very  probable  that  this  game  acquired  the  name  Checkers  or 
Checkers  Game  during  the  second  part  of  the  the  sixteenth 
century  in  Spain  (under  the  French  influence?). 

The  pieces  used  in  the  different  Checkers  games:  andarraia, 
alquerque,  and  checkers  were  the  reason  why  these  checkers 
games  were  translated  into  a  game  very  similar  to  the  Chess 
game  overseas,  where  checkers  were  practiced  with  chips. 

This  way  Marro  de  Punta  took  from  Chess: 

1 .  The  chessboard. 

2.  The  name  of  the  Spanish  chess  piece  -  Pawn. 

(The  figure  of  this  piece  has  its  origin  in  the  Alquerque  game) 

3.  The  figure  of  the  new  powerful  lady. 

4.  The  name  of  the  new  powerful  lady. 

5.  The  term  Punta,  which  has  its  origin  in  the  Catalan 
translation  of  the  Latin  Chess  Book  by  Jacobus  de  Cessolis.

8  ANDARRAYA 


8.1  The  precursor  of  the  draughts  game 

One  of  the  most  sensational  discoveries  related  to  finding  a 
probable  predecessor  of  the  Checkers  game  has  been  the  one 
from  Rob  Jansen  about  the  andarraya  .  Jansen  wondered 
whether  this  game  could  have  been  the  same  played  in  The 
Philippines282.  Jansen  introduced  several  references  and  the 
most  important  was  the  one  in  the  European-American 
Universal  Illustrated  Encyclopedia  (which  we  mention 
hereafter)  where  appears  the  etymology  of  the  word  andarraya. 
But  Corominas  does  not  incorporate  in  its  etymological 
dictionary  the  Andarraya  voice  and,  logically,  the  description  of 
the  mesh  pattern  in  a  word  which  could  summarize  it  has  to 
come  from  somewhere  else.  To  be  sure  that  andarraya  could  be 
equal  to  the  Philippine  checkers  board  as  we  know  it,  I  have 
tried  to  give  a  subsequent  analysis  of  the  Moroccan  word 
attaracha,  which  was  possible  thanks  to  the  etymology  of  the 
Spanish  words  atarraya  and  esparavel.  Now  after  the  facts 
exposing  hereafter  everything  indicates  that  the  Philippine 
checkers  game  is  nothing  but  the  old  andarraya  game.

8.2  The  etymology  of  the  word  Andarraya. 

Enciclopedia  Universal  Ilustrada283  (1987,  Vol  5:412) 
Andarraya  (etim  -  del  ar.  marroqui  attarracha,  red.,  por  la 
semejanza  entre  la  figurade  sus  mallas  y  los  cuadros  del  tablero) 
ant.  juego  que  se  hacia  con  piezas  o  piedras  sobre  un  tablero 
semejante  al  de  las  damas. 

Loose  translation: 

Andarraya  (Etym.  -  from  the  Arab  Moroccan  atarracha ,  mesh, 
by  the  similarity  between  the  figure  of  its  mesh  and  the  squares 
in  the  board)  Game  made  with  pieces  or  stones  over  a  board 
similar  to  the  board  of  checkers. 


8.3  The  etymology  of  the  word  Atarraya 

Andarraya  being  a  word  derived  from  the  word  attaracha, 
meaning  a  mesh,  we  have  researched  the  meaning  of  the  word 
attaraya  too,  which  means  mesh.  However,  the  first  document 
where  this  term  could  be  found  dates  back  to  1570. 

Universal  Illustrated  Encyclopedia  (1987,  Vol  6:864) 

8.3.1  Attaraya 

Especie  de  red  de  pescar,  semejante  al  esparavel,  que  se  arroja 
en  el  rio  a  fiierza  de  brazo.(etim.-  Del  arabe  hispanico  y  magrebi 
tarraha  id.  atarraha).  id.  (derivado  de  t-r-h  “arrojar”)  la  doc. 
1570.

AMERICANA  (1908-1930.  70  volumes,  thereafter  in  1930-1996  about  40 
supplements).  Espasa-Calpe,  Madrid.

Loose  translation: 


8.4  Attaraya 

A  kind  of  fishing  net,  similar  to  esparavel  (casting  net),  that  is 
thrown  in  the  river  by  arm.  (etim.-  from  the  Arab  Hispanic  and 
magrebi  tarraha  id.  atarraha).  Id.  (Derived  from  t-r-h  "arrojar  - 
throw")  1st  doc.  1570. 

In  Corominas284  (1987)  we  found: 

Etim.  -  Del  dr.  atarraha,  red  arrojadiza.)  f.  ant.  Red  para 
pescar.  V.  Esparavel 
Loose  translation: 

Etim.  -  AR.  atarraha  -  throwing  net,  f.  ant.  Fishing  net.  V. 
Esparavel  -  casting  net

etimologico  Castellano  e  hispanico,  Madrid. 


-  176- 


Thus  we  see  little  difference  between  the  words  attaracha 
(=andarraya)  and  atarraha  (=atarraya)  and  it  is  therefore  likely 
that  we  speak  here  about  the  fishermen's  net  -  a  type  of  fishing 
net  from  mesh  fabric.  Now  we  carefully  analyze  the  word 
Esparavel  -  casting  net. 


8.5  The  etymology  of  the  word  Esparavel 

Enciclopedia  Universal  Uustrada  (1987,  Volume  22:9): 
Esparavel.  Pesca.  Arte  de  pesca  de  tamano  pequeno,  de  hilo 
fino  y  de  forma  de  paracaidas  que  se  emplea  mucho  en  nuestras 
costas  desde  los  muelles,  desde  la  costa  6  desde  alguna 
embaracacion,  aunque  siempre  se  usa  mas  desde  tierra.  Este  arte 
se  dedica  principalmente  a  la  pesca  del  meruje,  llamado  tambien 
mujol  y  lisa,  y  se  le  denomina  en  unos  sitios  esparavel,  en  otros 
tarraya  y  en  otros  rallo  y  rail. 

Loose  translation: 


Esparavel.  Fishing.  Small  fishing  gear,  with 
a  fine  wire  and  parachute  shaped  that  is 
widely  used  in  our  coasts  from  the  piers, 
from  the  shore,  or  from  a  boat,  but  it  is 
always  more  used  from  the  ground.  This  art 
is  mainly  engaged  in  fishing  meruje,  also 
called  mullet  and  lisa,  and  is  called  casting 
net  in  some  places,  while  in  others  tarraya 
and  others  rallo  and  rail.

Corominas  noted  the  following: 

Red  redonda  para  pescar,  que  se  arroja  a  fuerza  de  brazo  en  los 
rios  y  parajes  de  poco  fondo . 

Loose  translation: 

Round  fishing  net  thrown  by  arm  in  rivers  and  shallow  spots . 


8.6  Commonalities:  Andarraya,  Esparavel,  and 
Atarraya 

We  therefore  see  that  andarraya  is  a  word  derived  from  the 
Moroccan  word  attaracha.  We  do  not  know  where  the 
Enciclopedia  Universal  Ilustrada  found  all  its  information, 
because  we  found  nothing  in  Corominas.  Attaracha  is  probably 
nothing  but  the  Moroccan  word  atarraha.  It  is  also  possible  that 
the  word  attaracha  was  not  well  written;  there  are  two  Ts  in  it 
and  it  could  be  a  typo.  We  are  left  to  discern  why  he  uses  the  ‘c’ 
in  attaracha,  as  it  is  not  in  the  word  atarraha  (with  two  Rs).  As 
the  two  Moroccan  words  mean  ‘net',  it  can  be  accepted  that  both 
words  mean  the  same  and  were  written  in  two  ways  by  the 
Enciclopedia  Universal  Ilustrada.  In  all  probability  this 
description  of  andarraya  comes  from  Leopoldo  Eguilaz  and 
Yanguas'  dictionary  .

8.6.1  Andarraya 

987 

In  the  Fishing  lexicon  in  Colombia  we  find  this  on  andarraya  : 


I.  Pesca  en  el  mar  caribe: 

Es  una  red  redondo  cuyo  diametro  varia  entre  2  y  8  metros  y 
cuyas  mallas  u  ojos  tienen  de  1  a  3  puntos  (punto  “ancho  de 
dedo”) . 

Loose  translation: 

I.  Caribbean  Sea  Fishing 

It  is  a  round  net  of  which  the  diameter  varies  between  2  and  8 
meters  and  of  which  the  mesh  or  holes  have  from  1  to  3  points 
("finger  width"  points)... 

II  Pesca  en  agua  dulce 

En  terminos  generales  la  atarraya  es  una  red  de  tamano  variable, 
tejida  en  forma  de  campana  y  con  plomada  por  toda  la 
circunferencia.  Corresponde  el  esparavel  del  diccionario 
academico. 

Loose  translation: 

II  Freshwater  fishing 

Overall  atarraya  is  a  net  of  varying  size,  woven  bell-shaped  and 
plumb  in  the  entire  circumference.  The  word  esparavel 
corresponds  to  the  definition  in  the  academic  dictionary.

8.6.2  Atarraya  and  esparavel 

Atarraya  and  esparavel  are  old  terms  and  therefore  it  is 
reasonable  that  these  words  are  used  in  the  former  Spanish 
colony.  Dr.  Antonio  de  Morga  described  in  the  early  sixteenth 
century  the  atarraya  net  and  esparavel. 

In  a  translation  by  H.E.J.  Stanley288  we  see: 

p.  280  (5  kilometer  van  Manilla) 

( . )  the  method  of  the  natives  for  catching  them,  is  by  making 

inclosures  of  bejucos,  which  are  canes  or  reeds,  solid  and  very  pliable, 
and  tough,  they  are  slender,  and  are  twisted  into  cables  and  other 
cordage  for  their  vessels.  They  catch  the  fish  inside  these  inclosures 
which  are  made  fast  in  a  ring  with  stakes,  and  in 
creels  which  they  make  of  those  canes;  and  the  most  ordinary  ways 
are  withy  watchtowers  (note  1)  and  fishing-nets,  and  other  small 
drag-nets,  and  with  strings  and  hooks  by  hand. 

note  1:  atarraya;  probably  for  atalaya,  a  raised  stand  from  which 
watchers  can  see  when  the  fish  come  within  the  nets. 

E.H.  Blair  also  describes  Dr.  Antonio  de  Morga’s  work  and 
also  quotes  Stanley ’s  translation: 

II  p.  96 

20  leguas  from  Manilla,  in  the  province  of  Bonbon,  is  another  lake  of 
the  same  name  (Bonbon),  not  so  extensive  as  the  former,  but  with  a 
great  abundance  of  fish.  The  natives’  method  of  catching  them  is  by 
making  corrals  of  bejucos,  which  are  certain 

slender  canes  or  rushes,  solid  and  very  pliant  and  strong;  these  are 
employed  for  making  cables  for  the  natives’  boats,  as  well  as  other

kinds  of  ropes.  They  catch  the  fish  inside  these  corrals,  having  made 
the  enclosures  fast  by  means  of  stakes.  They  also  catch  the  fish  in 
wicker  baskets  made  from  the  bejuccos,  but  most  generally  with 
atarrayas,  esparaveles,  other  small  barrederas,  and  with  handlines 
and  hooks. 

Atarraya,  a  species  of  fishing-net.  Stanley’s  conjecture  is  wrong. 
Esparavel  is  a  round  fishing-net,  which  is  jerked  along  by  the  fisher 
through  rivers  and  shallow  places.  Barredera  is  a  net  of  which  the 
meshes  are  closer  and  tighter  than  those  of  common  nets,  so  that  the 
smallest  fish  may  not  escape  it.

The  game  of  andarraya 


8.7  Andarraya,  an  ancient  line  game 

In  the  fifteenth  century  a  game  called  andarraya  which  closely 
resembled  our  current  game  of  checkers,  practiced  on  a 
chessboard,  was  known  in  Spain.  At  this  time  we  still  needed 


-  181  - 


several  data  and  references  to  determine  how  this  game  was 
practiced  in  the  past.  Therefore  we  are  now  stuck  with  the 
information  and  data  that  we  have  at  our  disposal  today  to  reach 
a  hypothesis.  Currently  we  have  different  references. 


8.7.1  Descriptions  of  Andarraya  in  literature 

8.7.1. 1  1400  Martin  el  Humano 


Red  wax  seal  of  Martin  el  Humano,  c.  1400 
King  of  Aragon  and  Sicily 


Martin  de  Humano  was  King  of  Aragon,  Valencia,  Sardinia  and 
Corsica  and  Count  of  Barcelona  from  1396  and  King  of  Sicily 
from  1409  (as  Martin  II).  While  in  the  sixteenth  century  the  use 


-  182  - 


of  checkered  boxes  was  common  in  weapons,  tiles,  and 
decorations,  in  the  fifteenth  century  we  find  especially  a  stripe 
system.  An  example  of  this  is  seen  in  Martin  el  Humano's  red 
wax  seal  (C.  1400).  In  the  Annex  engraving  of  a  wax  seal  we 
see  a  kind  of  board  built  on  a  stripe  system.  Also  behind  the 
King  Martin  el  Humano's  back,  in  Juan  II  there  appears  a  stripe 
system  as  a  game  of  andarraya.

8.7.1.2  1432  Juan  Alonso  de  Baena 

Juan  Alonso  de  Baena  (1406-1454)  was  a  Spanish  writer  bom  in 
Baena.  He  belonged  to  a  Jewish  family,  but  later  converted  to 
the  Catholic  religion  and  King  Juan  II  of  Castilla  appointed  him 
as  his  secretary.  One  of  his  most  important  works  is  the 
Cancionero  de  Baena  which  was  published  in  1499.  He  was 
friend  with  the  former  Constable  Alvaro  de  Luna  and  other 


-  183  - 


prominent  members  of  the  Court.  He  dedicated  his  poems  to 
these  people  as  a  form  of  supplication. 

415  Pregunta  de  Juan  Alfonso  contra  Canisares: 

Pues  vos  teneys  por  grant  papagayo/en  esta  giencia,  Senor 
Canisares, /dadme  rrespuesta  syn  falta  d’asares,/que  syempre  biudades 
syn  otro  desmayo;/ca  gierto  sepades,  senor,  que  m’enssayo/por  darvos 
jugando  vn  golpe  de  xaque;/por  ende  vos  cunple  armarvos  de 
jaque,/ca  segunt  creo  convusco  es  el  rrayo290.  (Baena, 
1432/1993:682) 

Loose  translation: 

Rrayo  is  related  to  ralo  and  rail  (Enciclopedia  Universal  Ilustrada 
1987,  Volume  22:9),  both  words  can  be  translated  as  esparavel 
(casting  net)  and  tarraya  -  a  mesh  patterned  net.  In  light  of  the 
foregoing,  rrayo  may  mean  a  striped  mesh  patterned  game. 


8.7.1.3  1454  Juan  de  Mena 

Juan  de  Mena’s  figure  was  very  important  in  the  fifteenth 
century;  he  was  the  one  who  mentioned  andarraya  in  some 
verses.  It  is  worth  pointing  out  here  that  in  Juan  de  Timoneda’s 
book  of  checkers  from  1635  we  found  a  couplet  of  high  art 
verses  that  according  to  Professor  Fuster  (Valencia)  were  the 
kind  of  verses  that  were  widely  used  in  the  fifteenth  century  . 
Again  and  again  there  appears  to  be  a  reference  to  Juan  de 
Mena,  a  poet  who  surpassed  his  contemporaries  regarding  such 
verses.

Juan  de  Mena's  life  runs  parallel  with  the  reign  of  Juan  II  of 
Castile  (1406-1454),  because  the  latter  was  born  in  1411  and 
died  in  1456.  Juan  de  Mena  (1411-1456),  bom  in  Cordoba,  was 
Juan  IPs  favourite  poet. 

Juan  de  Mena  resided  in  Florence  where  he  lived  at  the  court  of 
Pope  Eugenio  IV  during  1442-1443  and  was  protected  by  the 
cardinals  Cervantes  and  Juan  de  Torquemada,  who  were  present 
in  Italy  for  reasons  of  council  for  the  union  between  the  Greek 
and  Roman  Catholic  churches.  In  late  August  1453  Mena 
obtained  several  thousand  maravedis  raised  on  gambling  or 
gaming  tax  in  Cordoba.  Did  he  get  the  idea  or  the  term 
andarraya  for  them  to  put  in  his  verse  in  1454? 

Throughout  his  life  he  was  a  faithful  and  intimate  friend  of 
Marquis  de  Santillana.  In  1454  Juan  de  Mena  was  in  the  court 
of  the  Castilian  King  and  exchanged  verses  with  the  Marquis  of 
Santillana  about  the  four-day  fever  suffered  by  the  King.

From  the  text  it  is  inferred  that  andarraya  began  by  moving 
forward  and  the  pawn  could  return  once  arrived  at  the  end  of  the 
board.  That  is  also  the  case  in  checkers:  when  one  promotes  to 
king  (lady),  one  can  move  backwards.  The  piece  probably  still 
returned  with  a  short  king  (lady)  who  moved  only  one  square  on 
every  play.  It  is  clear  that  we  need  to  find  even  more  material  as 
evidence  to  affirm  this  rigorously.

8.7.1.4  1464  Juan  de  Lucena 


Juan  de  Lucena  (1430  -  1504)  in  his  treatise  Vita  Beata 
dedicated  to  King  Enrique  IV  introduced  three  glorious  authors: 
The  Marquis  of  Santillana,  Alonso  de  Cartagena,  and  Juan  de 
Mena. 

Juan  de  Lucena  was  King  Juan  II  of  Castile's  ambassador.  He 
wrote  Vita  Beata,  first  printed  in  Zamora  inl483.  In  all 
likelihood  Vita  Beata  was  written  between  1452  and  1455, 
prepared  in  the  form  of  a  dialogue  in  which  we  find  Inigo  Lopez 
de  Mendoza  (1398-1458),  known  as  Santillana  Marquis, 
Alfonso  de  Cartagena  (Bishop  of  Burgos),  and  Juan  de  Mena 
(Chronicler  of  the  King)  as  interlocutors.  Lucena's  work  is 
interesting  for  its  moral  considerations.  In  the  National  Library 
of  Madrid  there  is  a  Vita  Beata  manuscript  signed  in  1464  by 
the  writer  Juan  de  Lucena  . 

If  we  want  to  know  more  about  Juan  de  Lucena’s  life,  it  is  worth 
checking  the  works  of  Lapesa294and  Calvo295. 


Here  we  want  to  explain  some  phrases  from  pages  167  and 
168  regarding  andarraya  as  described  by  Paz  y  Melia: 

"....do  figuran  la  Spana,  fallaras,  senor  marques,  el  Mahometo, 
cernicalo  de  Granada,  sus  faldas  algacas,  mostramos  la  cola.  Ni  you

8.7.1.5  1475  Ms.  Douce  353 


This  is  a  partial  manuscript  reproduction  of  a  black  and  white 
miniature  MS  Douce  353,  in  possession  of  the  Bodleian 
Library.  Oxford,  England.  It  was  written  in  France  in  French  in 
the  third  quarter  of  the  fifteenth  century.  The  content  of  the 
manuscript  is  described  as  Histoire  ancienne  jusqu’a  Cesar  and 
the  image  on  page  31R  illustrates  the  real  story  of  the  great 
Troy,  ending  with  the  destruction  of  Troy  which  begins  on  page 
30V297.  Douce  MS  353  was  reproduced  in  several  works298

Andarraya  in  1475? 


The  miniature  is  cataloged  under  different  titles:  Argo  equipped, 
Carpenters  and  cooks  on  quay,  Jason  and  Hercules  play  chess, 
Chess  being  played. 

Ir.  G.  Bakker  discussed  this  miniature  in  detail  and  considers 
with  doubts  that  it  reflecting  andarraya  could  be  a  new  version 
of  the  board  game  of  alquerque  of  twelve. 

If  we  study  well  the  image  on  the  MS  Douce  353  it  appears  that 
we  see  a  checkered  board  with  pawns.  In  the  first  row  we 
observe  3  or  4  pawns,  on  the  second  row  5  and  on  the  third  row 
we  see  4  pawns.  Thus  we  see  totally  12  or  13  pawns.  The 
distance  between  the  three  rows  of  the  white  pawns  and  the 
black  pawns  is  short,  probabley  one  row  instead  of  the  two  rows

that  we  have  in  the  present  draughts  game.  Also  we  observe  a 
diagonal  move,  but  it  is  clear  that  we  can  also  have  an 
orthogonal  move,  such  as  is  happening  in  the  present  Turkish 
draughts  game. 


The  pawns  when  reaching  the  eighth  row  can  return,  but  it  is  not 
clear  if  there  indeed  was  a  promotion  of  the  pawn  to  king  or 
short  dama.  The  dictionaries  make  clear  that  the  game  was 
played  on  a  checkered  board  like  the  Spanish  chess  board. 


8.7.1.6  1495  Elio  Antonio  de  Nebrija 

1495,  Andarraia,  calculorum  ludus,  NOVUM 

The  first  reference  to  andarraya  was  found  by  Rob  Jansen  in 
Alonso's  dictionary299  which  quotes  Nebrija  (1495),  but 
Professor  Manuel  Munoz  Cortes  from  the  University  of  Murcia 
told  me  that  Alonso  was  not  very  reliable  many  times.  The  year 


299  ALONSO,  Martin  (1986).  Diccionario  Medieval  Espanol  desde  las 
Glosas  Emilianenses  y  Silenses  (S.  X)  hasta  el  siglo  XV,  Salamanca. 


-  192  - 


1495  indicated  by  Alonso  could  equally  be  1516300.  Jansen301 
says  in  Hoofdlijn  that  the  word  andarraya  is  in  Nebrija  of  the 
year  1492302,  but  this  is  a  mistake,  because  I  did  not  see  this 
word  in  the  original  dictionary  of  1492  .  The  dictionary 

quoted  by  Jansen  cannot  be  dated  from  1492,  but  from  1495.  It 
is  therefore  necessary  to  find  the  original  one  of  Antonio  de 
Nebrija.  This  I  did  and  it  turned  out  that  the  first  reference  to 
andarraya  was  in  Nebrija's  dictionary  from  1495304.  Jansen, 
rightly,  has  his  doubts,  because  instead  of  1495  also  1494  or 
even  1493  are  possible  dates  .  The  dictionary  made  by  Nebrija 
in  1495  was  published  again  in  1996  by  Garcia  Macho306. 

Therefore  1495  seems  to  be  the  most  reliable  date  and  then  it 
would  be  consistent  with  Alonso  (1986).  But  more  interesting 
are  the  words  we  find  in  Nebrija’s  dictionary  of  1495:

Elio  Antonio  de  Nebrija 


In  the  1495  dictionary  NOVUM  (New)  is  printed  in  separate 
forms  and  the  meanings  of  these  words  are  new.  So  that  the  new 
king  (lady),  i.e.  long  king  with  long  movements,  was  introduced 
in  chess  at  this  time.  It  all  harmonized  in  date  with  the  two 
treaties  on  the  new  powerful  king  in  chess:  Lucena  and 

O  AO 

Vinyoles  .  As  the  game  was  also  titled  andarraia  with 
Novum,  we  can  admit  that  the  game  of  andarraya  was  moved  to 
the  chessboard  and  obtained  the  (powerful)  long  King.

belonging  to  Juan  de  Mena.

We  have  said  earlier  that  the  first  mention  of  andarraya  dates 
from  1454  and  belongs  to  the  poet  Juan  de  Mena.  This  is  one 
proof  more  that  it  is  hard  to  trust  dictionaries.

MS  DOUCE  353  (c.  1475) 


-200- 


Here  we  see  two  men  playing  a  type  of  draughts  in  1470 
which  probably  was  Andarraya  in  the  Kingdom  of  Castile  and 
known  as  Marro  de  Punta  in  the  Kingdom  of  Aragon.  When  was 
the  forward  only  move  introduced?  We  do  not  know,  and  there 
is  no  reference  found  in  the  literature.  The  best  time  for 
introducing  the  forward  only  move,  thus  similar  to  the  chess 
pawns,  was  shortly  after  the  time  of  introduction  of  the  new 
powerful  Dama  in  chess  in  Valencia  that  changed  the  chess 
game  completely  in  1475.  In  the  case  of  the  new  andarraya 
(now  with  forward  only  moves  and  captures,  plus  the 
introduction  of  the  new  promotion  with  the  help  of  the  new 
powerful  dama),  I  think  that  the  date  is  between  1473  and  1495. 
Before  1495,  because  in  that  year  Francesch  Vicent  wrote  his 
chess  book  in  Valencia.  After  that  date  the  term  Andarraya 
disappeared  from  the  literature,  but  the  old  term  Alquerque  12 
continued,  and  now  the  Damas  or  Kings  were  probably  also 
introduced  to  it.  Due  to  the  introduction  of  Damas  to  alquerque 
12  this  game  was  confused  in  the  dictionaries  with  draughts. 
Branch326  saw  very  clearly  the  development  of  the  name 
Alquerque  12  toward  the  name  ‘juego  de  las  damas’: 

The  Spaniards  continued,  for  a  time,  using  the  name  of  ‘Alquerque’ 
for  Alquerque  on  the  chessboard.  Afterward  the  game  became  known 
as  the  game  of  the  damas,  or  ladies  . . . 

The  draughts  game  continued  to  be  called  Alquerque  for  some 
years  in  the  dictionaries  and  this  spurred  some  confusion.

8.9  Andarraya-type  checkers  games  of  Spanish 
origin 

8.9.1  Filipino  checkers 

The  Filipino  checkers  game  is  exactly  the  same  as  the  current 
game  of  checkers  where  the  diagonal  is  found  to  the  right,  as  is 
the  case  in  the  current  Spanish  game.

Murray  mentions: 

The  Spanish  game  is  also  played  in  the  Philippines  (Culm,  p. 
648)  under  the  name  dama,  but  on  the  lined  board  of  fig.  33.

8.9.1. 1  Lallement  board 

This  simplification  was  first  suggested  by  J.G.  Lallement  in 
1802.  Spanish  draughts  is  also  played  in  Hawaii  where  it  is 
called  moo  and  played  on  the  chessboard  ( Culin ,  p.  244). 

Here  we  can  observe  the  following: 

1.  Murray  in  his  Filipino  checkers  drawing  has  the  diagonal  to 
the  left,  while  the  diagonal  in  the  Spanish  game  is  on  the  right. 

2.  Murray  also  says  that  this  game  simplification  was  first 
suggested  by  the  Frenchman  J.G.  Lallement.

We  must  remember  here  that  the  first  checkerboard  of  Friesland 
(Holland)  with  stripes  and  squares  dates  from  1724  and  Jan  van 
Leiden's  checkerboard  between  1500  and  1530.  Both  checker¬ 
boards  have  been  mentioned  in  the  chapter  on  Marro  de  Punta. 

8.9.1.2  Andarraya  played  on  holes 

The  idea  of  Andarraya  with  diagonal  movement  could  also  be 
played  on  holes.

Andarraya  played  on  holes 

In  the  following  photo  we  clearly  observe  the  characteristics  of 
draughts  played  on  32  squares.  One  of  the  characteristic  signs  of 
the  Spanish  game  is  that  the  long  diagonal  is  on  the  right. 
However,  this  is  not  the  feature  we  see  here  on  this  stone, 
because  the  long  diagonal  is  on  the  left  when  people  are  sitting 
on  the  bank  on  each  side  of  the  game.  Anyway,  it  is  clear  that 
centuries  ago  players  did  not  need  a  chessboard,  they  could  play 
with  lines  (Andarraya  board)  and  also  with  the  help  of  these  32 
holes. 

This  board  was  found  on  the  banks  of  church  Santa  Maria  de 
Navamorcuende  that  belongs  to  the  province  of  Toledo.  This 
church  was  built  in  the  XVI  century  by  Pedro  de  Tolosa, 
member  of  the  team  of  Juan  Bautista  de  Toleda,  who  was  in 


-204- 


charge  of  the  construction  of  the  important  Monastery  of  El 
Escorial  near  to  Madrid.

When  I  contacted  David  Gutierrez  Pulido,  the  discoverer  of  this 
drawing  through  Facebook,  he  did  not  reply.  For  that  reason  I 
am  not  allowed  to  publish  his  photo  taken  in  earlier  years  which 
is  in  my  possession.  Consequently  I  had  to  look  for  a  voluntary 
person.  Fortunately  Mr.  Jose  Luis  Lozano  Egea  declared  that  he 
was  willing  to  help  me  in  a  disinterested  way  by  acquire  the

According  to  the  archaeologist  Jose  Manuel  Hidalgo  Cunarro 
this  is  a  mancala  game,  but  it  is  difficult  for  him  to  establish  the 
chronology  of  this  drawing.  Since  the  church  was  built  around 
1580  it  is  logical  to  think  that  it  was  in  those  days  that  some 
people  played  andarraya  or  draughts  instead  of  alquerque. 

At  the  beginning  of  2013  I  became  aware  of  another  draughts 
board.  This  board  belongs  to  the  church  of  La  Santisima 
Trinidad  (the  Holiest  Trinity)  located  in  the  historic  heart  of 
Segovia.

There  people  can  observe  in  the  gantry  well  preserved  draughts 
holes  in  the  basement  of  the  third  intercolumnio  of  archery.  Jose 
Arturo  Salgado  Pantoja  mentioned  this  as  a  chessboard,  but  it  is 


-207- 


clear  that  the  32  squares  have  a  meaning,  viz.  to  play  draughts 
on  the  32  squares  because  64  squares  are  not  necessary  . 

If  we  carefully  study  this  drawing,  we  see  that  the  long  diagonal 
is  on  the  right  hand.  This  is  thus  the  same  as  in  the  Spanish 
draughts  game,  where  players  were  moving  in  the  sixteenth 
century  on  the  white  squares  and  the  long  white  diagonal  was 
precisely  on  the  right.  This  is  thus  proof  that  indeed  this  game, 
which  others  label  as  chess,  was  no  other  game  than  Spanish 
draughts. 

Fortunately  another  board  with  holes  was  found.  It  is  a 
chequered  chessboard  carved  on  the  stone  floor  of  Troubadour's 
tower  of  Palacio  La  Aljaferia  in  Zaragoza  according  to  Monreal 
y  Tejada  .  It  was  in  use  by  the  prisoners  who  were  held  there. 
The  date  was  fixed  presumably  to  be  in  the  late  15th  century. 

In  this  case  we  believe  more  in  an  andarraya  game  that  became 
popular  in  the  15th  century  and  for  which  a  checkered  board  was 
used  and  opponents  only  played  diagonally  on  one  colour.

8.9.1.3  Andarrya  on  chessboard  or  Roman  board 

An  Andarraya  board  (chessboard  or  Roman  board)  was  found  in 
a  place  known  as  the  Fonte  do  Ermitan  (Guarda,  Pontevedra)  in 
the  eighties  of  the  last  century.  The  board  in  question  was  40  x 
40cm  and  has  64  squares  (8  x  8).  Strangely  enough,  nearby 
there  was  another  board  of  45  x  35  that  had  56  squares  (8  x  7), 
which  decreases  the  probability  of  andarrya  for  the  8  x  8  board. 

It  is  quite  clear  that  these  boards  were  used  for  playing.  The 
hermitage  of  Santa  Tegra  of  the  XVI  century,  to  which  annually 
in  August  comes  a  group  of  men  in  procession  to  meet  with  an 
ancestral  vow  of  thanksgiving,  has  an  ancient  road  that  goes  to 
the  water  source  of  Fonte  do  Ermitan.  The  thirst  was  quenched 
with  water  and  playing  on  the  boards.

8.9.1.4  Tukvnanawopi’s  board 

Further  to  Culin  (1907:795),  he  mentions  in  the  board  game 
Tukvnanawopi  (Arizona): 

The  inclosed  spaces  outside  the  squares  are  called  houses.  In 
these  the  killed  animals  are  placed. 

By  ‘houses'  he  means  the  boxes  in  the  checkerboard  or 
chessboard  in  Spain,  where  the  usual  term  is  casilla  or  square. 
This  board  game  is  much  like  the  board  game  that  Culin 
(1907:792)  describes  in  Fig.  1088  (New  Mexico).

8.9.1.5  The  Net

(la  red):  p.  584/585  Dam,  Draughts;  or  literally  the  Net. 

This  game,  which  is  also  known  in  India,  is  closely  allied  to 
Polish  Draughts.  The  pieces  move  in  the  squares  instead  of 
going  along  the  lines.  (....)

8.9.1.6  The  Moo  Checkers 

O  O /T 

Culin  mentions  that  in  the  checkers  played  in  Hawaii  by  the 
name  of  Moo  the  squares  are  called  ha-le  (home).  And  so  the 
checkers  game  Moo  also  discovers  a  Spanish  origin,  because  in 
the  Spanish  game  the  squares  on  the  chessboard  or 
checkerboard  are  called  houses  (casas). 


Fulton  describes  a  type  of  checkers  game  in  Hawaii: 

“In  old  Hawai’i  konane  boards  were  made  on  large  flat  stones 
or  made  from  pieces  of  wood.  The  boards  were  of  many 
different  sizes.  King  Kamehameha  Y  was  very  good  at  playing 
konane ”.

8.10  Checkers  in  the  Philippines 


The  Philippines  were  discovered  in  1521  by  the  Spaniard 
Fernando  de  Magallanes  during  a  trip  to  the  spice  islands  of  the 
Moluccas.  However  it  was  not  until  1543  when  the  Spaniards 
were  able  to  settle  in  smoothly. 


8.10.1  1977  Nid  Anima 

A  description  of  the  Filipino  checkers  game  is  found  in  the  book 

3  38 

Filipino  Games  : 

p.  60-63  Dama 

Filipinos  may  claim  dama  or  checkers  in  Shakespeare’s  language  -  to 
be  an  indigenous  game  with  them,  but  so  do  most  other  countries.  In 
fact,  almost  all  countries  stake  a  claim  to  it.  We  are  told  that  its  origin 
dates  back  to  the  year  4.000  B.C.  King  Rameses  was  reputed  to  be 
addicted  to  this  game  ,  or  so  attest  the  large  inscriptions  discovered  in 
the  ancient  temples  of  Thebes.  It  is  also  a  popular  amusement  among 
the  Moors. 

Dama  is  played  2  ways,  the  so-called  derecha  and  the  Italiana.  In  the 
former,  the  movements  as  well  as  the  capturing  of  pawns  are  always 
straight  ahead  and  never  backwards.  While  in  the  latter,  the 
movement  is  also  straight  ahead,  but  there  is  a  noticeable  difference  in 
the  capturing  of  pawns,  as  it  is  allowed  to  leap  backwards.  Whenever 
the  Filipinos  play  the  dama,  they  always  specify  beforehand  under 
which  type  they  are  playing,  whether  derecha  or  Italiana,  so  as  to 
avoid  confusion  and  misunderstanding.  Checkers  is  traditionally 
played  in  the  manner  of  the  indigenous  derecha.  All  indications  point 
to  the  second  type’s  name  as  signifying  an  Italian  vintage.  The 
ilocanos  never  fail  to  specify  that  the  game  be  played  in  the  socalled 
peon  tugaw,  meaning  that  every  move  should  be  final  and  cannot  be 
retracted.  In  other  words,  touch  move  or  so  they  identify  it  in 


338  ANIMA,  Nid  (1977).  Filipino  Games,  Quezon  City  (Omar  Publications).

English.  Thus  it  behooves  upon  every  player  to  study  his  moves  well 
to  avoid  the  temptation  of  backtracking. 

Two  persons  usually  play  the  dama.  To  other  peoples  like  the 
Americans  and  Englishmen,  it  is  played  on  a  chess-board.  The 
Filipinos,  however,  play  it  on  crisscross  lines.  There  is  practically  no 
difference  in  how  either  play  it.  The  movements  are  always  a  single 
step,  except  when  it  captures  and  leaps  over  one  step.  The  objective  of 
the  game,  whether  it  is  dama  or  checkers,  is  to  capture  the  most,  if 
not  all  pawns.  The  one  who  kills  all  the  enemies  wins.  The  pawn  that 
reaches  the  enemy  fortresses  -  there  are  five  of  it  in  the  dama  -  gets 
promoted:  it  becomes  a  dame:  or  king  to  the  checkers  habitues.  As 
such,  it  becomes  powerful  because  it  is  empowered  to  move  by  leaps 
from  end  to  end  of  the  line,  if  so  desired.  Incidentally,  the  dama  is 
distinguished  from  the  other  pawns  by  crowning,  meaning  another 
pawn  is  placed  atop  it.  In  chess,  a  pawn  that  achieves  the  feat  of  the 
dama  gets  promoted  likewise  by  becoming  a  rook.  The  pawns  that 
Filipinos  are  habituated  to  using  includes  beverage  corks,  stones, 
shells  and  sometimes  buttons.  When  the  beverage  cork  is  used,  one 
player  uses  it  in  a  rightside  up  manner,  while  the  other  in  an  upside- 
down  manner,  so  as  to  make  them  distinguishable  and  prevent 
possible  confusion.  Checker  habitues,  on  the  other  hand,  use  round 
wooden  pegs. 

Dama  has  much  to  concede  to  chess.  The  latter  is  more  imaginative 
than  the  former.  Its  pawns  are  more  symbolic.  Knight,  bishop,  rook, 
queen,  king-  they  are  really  more  representative  of  real  life  characters. 
But  beyond  these,  the  difference  becomes  insignificant.  The  dama 
has  12  pawns,  but  so  does  chess.  The  dama  pawns  move  diagonally 
and  in  single  steps,  except  when  capturing  an  enemy.  While  chess 
pawns  move  in  various  directions  the  knight  in  L-shape  movements, 
the  bishop  diagonally  and  by  great  leaps,  if  so  desired;  the  pawns  and 
rook  straight  ahead  but  with  the  former  by  single  steps,  while  the 
latter  by  great  distances  when  necessary;  the  king  and  queen  flexibly 
and  versatilely,  with  the  distinction  that  the  former  is  limited  to  just  a 
single  step  each  time,  while  the  latter  by  leaps  and  bounds,  according 
to  expediency. 

The  dama  may  not  be  as  encompassing  as  chess  in  terms  of  its 
intellectual  possibilities  which  has  been  prounced  to  be  infinite,  but 


-217- 


this  nevertheless  doesn't  make  it  any  less  challenging  to  the  intellect. 
For  it  possesses  qualities  that  are  no  less  interesting. 


The  rules  seen  here  have  much  to  do  with  the  game  of  Spanish 
checkers.  The  large  diagonal  is  found  in  the  Spanish  game  on 
the  right.  When  a  piece  is  touched,  it  must  move  mandatorily. 
Capturing  is  mandatory  and  one  cannot  eat  backwards  with  the 
pawns.  There  is  a  long  (powerful)  king  -  dama  -  that  can  move 
in  all  directions.  A  pawn  can  only  capture  forward.  If  the  pawn 
is  promoted  to  lady  capturing  enemy  pieces  and  can  keep 
capturing  enemy  pawns  backwards,  you  will  have  to  crown 
first.  Then  it  is  the  opponent's  turn  to  move.  The  opponent  can 
move  or  protect  his  threatened  pawn.  In  the  Spanish  game  the 
piece  is  always  called  pawn  and  the  crowned  piece  is  always 
called  dama  -  lady  /  queen. 


8.10.2  1980  Prof.  Mellie  Leandicho  Lopez 

There  is  an  in-depth  study  on  the  Filipino  checkers  . 

Nr.  78  Queen  -  dama  -  (Chess),  Tagalog,  Cabanatuan  City, 
Nueva  Ecija,  Island  huzon.  (Dama  literally  means  queen). 

Props: 

a  small  wooden  board,  about  10  or  11  inches  square,  with  a 
diagram.  If  a  board  is  not  available,  the  diagram  may  be  drawn 
on  the  ground,  table  top,  or  doorstep.  24  Pieces  (pitsas)  or  men 
(12  for  each  player)  using  any  of  the  following:  small  sections 
of  bamboos,  stones,  beans,  colored  tiles,  broken  china,  beads, 
bottle  caps  (the  important  point  is  to  use  whatever  is  available 


339  LEANDICHO  LOPEZ,  Mellie  (1980).  A  study  of  Philippine  Games, 
Quezon  City,  Philippines.

so  long  as  the  pitsas  of  one  player  can  be  distinguished  from 
those  of  his  opponent.  The  popular  ones  used  in  Nueva  Ecija  are 
stones  against  bottle  caps). 


Pre-game: 

Formation  -  the  2  players  sit  across  each  other  with  the  diagram 
between  them.  Each  player  places  his  men  at  the  intersection  of  the 
lines  of  the  diagram.  Object:  the  ultimate  object  of  the  game  is  to 
capture  all  of  opponent’s  men  especially  the  queen.  Basic  rule:  every 
move  (tulak  or  kilos)  is  always  forward  (pasulong  or  abante)  to  an 
intersection,  never  backward  (atrasan),  except  for  the  queen  (dama). 

Movements: 

1 .  the  first  player  moves  his  stone  to  an  intersection.  The  other  player 
moves  his  bottle  cap.  note:  the  various  moves  of  each  player  depend 
on  his  own  technique  and  strategy.  Each  strives  to  move  his  pieces 
toward  the  line  directly  in  front  of  his  opponent,  in  order  to  have  a 
powerful  dama  and  at  the  same  time  eat  (kain)  as  many  of  his 
opponent’s  pieces  along  the  way). 

2.  Any  player  eats  or  captures  an  opponent’s  pitsa  that  stand  in  the 
next  intersection  by  jumping  to  the  empty  intersection  behind  it.  (the 
succesfull  player  removes  the  captured  piece) 

3.  The  player  who  succeeds  in  making  one  of  his  pitsas  reach  the  first 
line  on  the  opponent’s  side  gets  a  queen  (dama).  (note:  the  queen  is 
the  most  powerful  piece  on  the  board.  Skillful  use  of  the  queen  is  a 
great  asset  in  winning  the  game) 

(a)  the  queen  can  move  any  distance  in  any  straight  line 

(b)  she  can  move  forward,  backward,  sidewise,  or  diagonally  as  far 
men  may  stop  her  as  her  path  is  clear;  only  one  of  her  own  in  her 
progress  in  a  line. 

(c)  she  may  eat  or  capture  any  opponent  exposed  to  her  direct 
approach. 

4.  The  player  who  succeeds  in  eating  or  capturing  most  or  all  of  his 
opponent’s  pieces  wins.  Some  players  do  not  wait  for  an  opponent  to 
capture  all  their  men.  When  they  realize  that  their  chances  of  winning 
is  hopeless,  they  declare,  Tale  na  ako  (meaning,  I  lose)  and  the  game 
ends.  There  are  instances  during  the  game  when  an  opponent  would 
intentionally  sacrifice  one  of  his  men  and  force  the  other  player  to  eat 
it.  This  is  a  strategic  move  meant  to  improve  the  position  of  the  player

involved  or  a  move  to  trap  a  queen  or  a  piece  that  is  about  to  be  a 
queen.  There  is  a  cardinal  rule  in  Philippine  dama  that  every  time  a 
player  puts  one  of  his  pitsas  in  the  path  of  an  opponent,  that  opponent 
must  eat,  whether  he  likes  it  or  not.  The  moment  a  player's  piece 
becomes  a  queen,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  that  player  to  make  that 
pitsa  easily  recognized  by  the  opponent,  obviously  because  of  the 
queen's  many  powers.  If  the  new  queen  is  a  bottle  cap,  he  gets 
another  cap  and  puts  it  on  top  of  the  new  queen.  If  he  has  a  stone  for 
a  new  queen,  he  gets  one  of  the  opponent  and  places  his  stone  queen 
inside  the  cap.  In  other  words,  the  new  queen  must  be  different  from 
the  other  pieces.  There  is  no  king  in  this  Philippine  version  of  chess. 
The  pieces  are  identical  and  only  one,  the  queen  has  a  rank  and 
special  powers  but  she  has  to  achieve  and  work  for  that  rank. 


After  this,  there  follows  a  whole  page  with  comments  on  the 
Chinese  Chess,  chess  in  the  United  States,  checkers  in  Hawaii, 
and  considerations  on  the  active  role  of  king  or  queen  in 
civilizations.  The  writer,  a  teacher  who  moved  to  the  United 
States,  considered  checkers  a  form  of  chess.  Anyway,  she  is 
very  aware  of  everything  that  was  published  in  regards  of  games 
and  mind  games. 

The  word  ‘atrasan’,  as  the  text  says,  is  Spanish  and  means  to 
move  backward.  The  word  ‘eat’  means  to  eat  in  Spanish  and  is 
nothing  other  than  the  word  used  in  the  game  of  Spanish 
checkers  to  refer  to  capturing  pieces.  It  is  also  stated  here  in  the 
text  that  its  origin  is  Spanish.  Noteworthy  is  the  variety  of  uses 
of  ‘Queen’.  Dama  here  literally  means  ‘Queen’.  In  Spain  the 
crowned  pawn  has  always  the  same  meaning,  the  same  as  in 
chess,  i.e.  dama  or  reina.

draughts  was  played,  and  known  by  2  names,  mu  and  konane.  This 
word  mu  is  also  the  Maori  name  for  our  game  of  draughts  (mu  and 
kaimu),  and  as  mu  is  the  Maori  pronunciation  of  our  world  move,  it

strolling  Paniora  (Spaniard)  in  the  early  days  of  European  settlement.

A  belated  note: 

I  have  been  informed  that  in  the  Spanish  game  of  draughts  a  great 
number  of  pieces  are  employed,  and  it  is  known  that  Spanish  vessels 
visited  the  Hawaiian  Isles  as  early  as  the  16th  century . 

It  seems  not  improbably  that  the  Spanish  form  of  the  game  of 
draughts  was  introduced  into  the  Hawaiian  Isles  in  the  16th  of  17th 
century  by  Spanish  voyagers,  some  of  whom  certainly  visited  the 
group.  The  Hawaiian  tradition  of  shipwrecked  white  folk  living 
among  them  many  generations  ago  probably  refers  to  Spanish  folk.

8.11  William  Shelley  Branch 

It  has  not  been  given  much  attention  in  the  history  of  checkers 
to  the  checkers  historian  William  Shelley  Branch  (1854-1933), 
who  was  like  Jose  Brunet  and  Bellet341,  of  the  opinion  that  the 
game  of  alquerque  of  12  was  a  precursor  of  the  current  game  of 
checkers.  Branch  was  truly  a  pioneer  in  his  historical  work  on 
checkers,  which  he  published  in  1911  and  1912  in  The 
Pittsburgh  Leader  (USA).  He  was  well  underway  with  his 
hypothesis  about  the  origin  of  checkers,  suggesting  that  the 
game  was  played  on  a  board  with  stripes  around  1300.  This  date 
seems  too  early  to  me.  It  is  very  likely  that  we  have  to  place  the 
date  a  century  later.  It  is  enough  to  indicate  here  the  following 
brief  items  from  this  historian342: 

12.11.1911 

As  I  am  now  parting  with  the  old  Alquerque  board  I  may  mention 
that  a  chess  board  is  not  required  for  draughts  at  all.  Its  use  is 
customary  and  convenient,  but  the  gamecan  be  played  without  it  and 
has  been.  It  could  be  played  on  a  board  of  32  spots  orcircles,  but  I 
think  the  best  would  be  (apart  from  a  chess  board)  the  Lallement 
Draughts  board.... 

14.1.1912 

A  board  on  the  same  principle  as  the  Lallement  has  been  used  for 
centuries  in  the  Philippine  Islands. 

26.11.1911 

As  to  the  chessboard,  we  use  it,  but  our  game  does  not  require  it,  and 
could  have  had  its  own  special  board  from  the  first,  if  the  players  had 
thought  of  it  and  devised  it.  A  I  have  pointed  out,  and  as  many  knew 
before,  checkers  can  be  played  and  is  played  on  a  board  of

intersecting  lines;  and  also  on  a  board  of  32  squares  or  diamonds 
rather,  invented  by  a  noted  French  draughtsplayer,  M.  Lallement.  Our 
game  is  quite  independent  of  the  chessboard,  if  we  choose  to  make  it 
so.  What  is  come  to  it  is  that  the  game  of  checkers  is,  including  its 
more  elementary  form,  much  older  than  the  board  we  play  it  on,  so  far 
as  draughts  is  concerned.  The  board,  in  an  uncheckered  state,  is  older 
than  chess,  as  it  was  used  for  a  dice  game  in  India  before  chess  was 
invented.  Both  chess  players  and  checker  players  have  taken  a  board 
that  belongs  to  somebody  else! 

If  we  can  believe  Branch,  we  deduce  from  this  that  the  pattern 
of  the  andarraya  game  was  already  some  centuries  old.  Our 
game  of  andarraya  can  be  taken  from  the  chessboard  in  the 
fifteenth  century,  but  it  may  equally  be  possible  that  the 
construction  of  the  andarraya  board  already  existed  longer 
before  in  Spain. 

In  all  likelihood  we  can  admit  that  andarraya,  as  was  discovered 
by  Rob  Jansen,  was  a  game  that  was  practiced  before  the 
Spanish  checkers,  using  the  chessboard.  It  was  an  intermediate 
option  between  two  games: 

the  ancient  game  of  alquerque  of  12  and  the  game  on  a 
chessboard,  as  indicated  in  the  schemes  below.

8.12  Catch  the  Hare 

A  similar  situation  is  probably  found  in  other  games  as  well.  As 
Alfonso  X  the  Wise  described,  the  game  of  catch  the  hare  in 
1283.  This  pastime,  according  to  Culin344,  was  called  coyote  y 
polios  by  Pagago  Indians  (Arizona)  and  Culin  himself  says  that 
it  is  go  the  European  origin.  Over  time  the  game  was  simplified 
and  so  the  pastime  of  coyote  was  developed,  which  was 
practiced  in  Mexico345.  The  simplification  was  carried  out  in  the 
game  and  so  was  finally  bom  the  Hare  game.  This  entertain¬ 
ment,  according  to  Culin  (1907:  798),  was  practiced  at  the  end 
of  the  twentieth  century  in  Spain  and  this  pastime  was  played 
under  the  name  of  las  liebres  y  el  indio  in  New  Mexico  (Culin, 
1907:  79).  This  way  we  obtain  the  following  schemes:

2. Coyote  y  polios

8.13  The  disappearance  of  the  term 
Andarraya 

It  may  be  a  strange  phenomenon,  but  the  term  andarraya 
quickly  disappeared  from  everyday  life  in  Spain  in  the  sixteenth 
century.  The  fact  that  it  is  still  used  in  different  dictionaries  is 
mainly  due  to  the  authors  of  the  various  dictionaries  blindly 
copying  Nebrija’s  words.  But  if  the  term  andarraya 
disappeared,  would  the  game  do  so  too?  No,  the  game  was 
saved  under  the  generic  name  alquerque  in  the  sixteenth  century 
and  beyond.  The  test  is  provided  by  Covarrubias  (\  61 1 )  and  the 
various  dictionaries  describing  alquerque  as  a  game  of 
checkers.  The  Moor  game  of  alquerque  of  12  gradually 
disappears  from  Spain  now  that  the  Moors  should  embrace  the 
Catholic  religion  and  Christian  customs  since  1501. 

Jansen  clearly  perceived  this  possibility  when  he  wrote:  I felt 
the  gradually  growing  feeling  that  the  game  of  checkers  was 
practiced  at  first  on  a  striped  board.  Also  Pratesi349  was 
accurate  when  he  wrote  about  draughts  (Net)  years  ago: 

In  conclusion  it  seems  quite  possible  that  terms  of  a  family 
different  from  dama  or  dame  could  indicate  draughts  during 
the  first  time  of  its  existence.  Pratesi's  thesis  was  based  on 
Torrelli’s  work  dealing  with  table  games  at  the  end  of  his 
book  without  specifying  them.

For  years  I  knew  that  the  word  alquerque  in  Covarrubias'  text 
was  some  kind  of  game  of  checkers,  but  could  not  reach  a 
decisive  conclusion  because  I  never  believed  that  the  alquerque 
of  12  of  Alfonso  X  the  Wise  in  1283  could  have  been  a  game  of 
checkers.  After  studying  Covarrubias'  text  a  lot  I  finally  came  to 
the  conclusion  that  the  game  of  alquerque  was  nothing  more 
than  the  game  of  andarraya  or  eventually  the  stripe  system  of 
andarraya  placed  on  a  chessboard  . 

Now  we  study  Covarrubias'  following  words: 

-  escaque: 

llamamos  escaques  las  casas  quadradas  del  tablero  del  acedrez  o 
los  angulos  de  los  quadros  de  la  tabla  del  alquerque,  que  se 
juega  con  pedrecitas  blancas  y  negras,  y  suelen  comer  con  una, 
dos  y  tres,  y  este  parece  ser  el  juego  antiguo,  que  llamavan  de 
los  ladroncillos,  del  qual  hazen  mencion  los  poetas.  Ouidio,  De 
Arte  Amandi;  Cautaque  non  stulte  latronum  praelia  ludat,  - 
Unus  cum  gemino  calculus  hoste  perit.  Quando  con  una 
piedra  que  da  al  contrario  le  gana  dos,  saltando  de  una  en  otra 
casa,  Marcial:  Hie  mihi  bisseno  numeratur  tessaera  puncto, 

-  Calculus  hie  gemino  discolor  hoste  perit. 


Loose  translation: 

We  call  squares  the  square  boxes  of  the  chessboard  or  the 
comers  of  the  squares  of  the  alquerque  board,  that  one  plays 
with  white  and  black  small  stones  and  where  the  players  usually 
capture  one,  two  or  three  pieces,  and  this  seems  to  be  the  old 
game,  that  was  called  the  old  robber  game  of  which  the  poets

make  mention.  Ouidio,  De  Arte  Amandi;  Cautaque  non 
stulte  latronum  praelia  ludat,  -  Unus  cum  gemino  calculus 
hoste  perit.  When  a  player  gives  his  piece  to  the  enemy  and  he 
wins  two,  jumping  from  one  house  to  another  one.  Marcial: 
Hie  mihi  bisseno  numeratur  tessaera  puncto,  -  Calculus  hie 
gemino  discolor  hoste  perit. 

We  see  that  the  angles  of  the  tables  that  Covarrubias  quotes  here 
refer  to  the  andarraya  board.  Covarrubias  leaves  to  be  captured, 
more  than  3  pieces  in  such  alquerque,  as  is  the  case  in  checkers. 
With  the  game  of  alquerque  of  12,  where  you  can  also  capture 
back,  you  can  do  so  for  more  than  3  pieces,  so  I  do  not  think 
this  last  game  appears  in  Covarrubias'  texts. 

-  alquerque 

Alquerque  es  un  juego  de  piedrecillas,  sobre  un  tablero  rayado 
que  haze  diversos  quadros,  y  por  las  rayas  van  moviendose,  y 
quando  hallan  tercera  casa  vacia  del  contrario,  passan  a  ella, 
ganandole  la  piedra  que  estava  en  medio;  que  algunas  vezes 
acaece  ser  dos  y  tres,  y  si  pudiendo  tomar,  no  lo  haze,  pierde  la 
suya,  y  por  termino  propio  se  la  soplan.  En  griego  se  llama  este 
juego  schyraphia,  ( . ). 

El  padre  Guadix  dize  que  el  nombre  alquerque  es  arabigo,  y 
lo  mesmo  que  en  castellano  llamamos  castro,  porque  tiene 
semejan9a  el  tablero  rayado  donde  se  juega,  a  la 
castramentacion  lineada  en  planta.  Diego  de  Urrea  dize  ser 
juego  de  pedreguelas  sobre  rayas,  y  que  en  su  termino  arabigo 
es  herequetum,  que  vale  movimiento,  del  verbo  hereque,  que 
significa  mover,  porque  las  pedre9uelas  se  van  moviendo  de  uno

a  otro  angulo.  Deste  mesmo  verbo  trae  origen  la  palabra  harre 
aqul,  por  arreque,  que  vale  tanto  como  muevete.. 

Loose  translation: 

Alquerque  is  a  game  with  stones  on  a  line  board  with  several 
squares,  and  the  stones  move  along  the  lines.  When  there  is  an 
open  third  square  of  the  enemy  the  stone  can  jump  to  this  place, 
winning  a  piece  that  stood  in  the  middle;  in  some  cases  it  may 
be  two  or  three  stones.  And  when  one  has  to  capture  with  a 
stone  and  fails  to  do  this,  then  this  stone  is  lost,  and  one  blows 
the  stone.  In  Greek  they  call  this  game  schyraphia,  ( . ). 

Father  Guadix  says  that  the  name  alquerque  is  Arabic  and  the 
same  that  we  in  Castilian  call  Castro,  because  the  line  boards  on 
which  one  plays  resemble  the  regular  ground  patterns  of  army 
camps.  Diego  de  Urrea  calls  it  a  pebbles  play  on  lines  and  says 
that  the  Arabic  term  is  herequetum  which  means  movement; 
from  the  verb  hereque  -  to  move,  because  the  pebbles  move 
from  one  end  to  a  different  angle.  The  same  verb  is  the  origin  of 
the  word  harre  here  for  arreque,  which  means  moving  yourself. 


Andarraya  in  the  fifteenth  century  is  the  game 
of  alquerque  in  the  sixteenth  century

-  Soplar 

En  ciertos  juegos  del  alquerque  llaman  soplar  el  tomar  la  pie?a 
del  contrario,  que  pudo  ganar  con  ella  y  no  lo  hizo. 

Loose  translation: 

In  some  alquerque  games  they  use  the  term  blow  for  the 
elimination  of  an  enemy  piece  that  forgot  to  capture. 

The  strange  thing  here  in  Spanish  checkers  of  the  sixteenth 
century  called  Marro  de  punta  is  that  it  was  practiced  on  a 
chessboard  and  capturing  was  mandatory.  Maybe353  this  same 
game  was  called  au  dames  in  France  by  Rabelais,  in  which  it  is 
allowed  to  blow,  because  there  was  another  French  game  called 
au  force354  in  1535.  Possibly  the  latter  term  was  used  for 
mandatory  capturing.  Some  years  later  in  1542  the  term  was 
changed  to  forgat355. 

With  Rob  Jansen's  discovery  of  the  term  andarraya  he  finally 
had  the  Castilian  name  for  Marro  de  Punta,  which  I  had  been 
looking  for  over  many  years. 

Since  there  are  no  documents,  we  can  only  guess  that  there  were 
intermediate  steps  in  andarraya  on  the  chessboard.  In  the  final 
stage  we  see  a  game  that  is  played  diagonally  and  why  not 
orthogonally.  We  still  cannot  consider  this  to  be  draughts, 


353  There  is  a  lot  of  doubt  about  this.  The  terms  au  force  and  format  were  also 
used  in  French  board  and  card  games.  Take  a  look  at  the  chapter  on  Dama 
where  Francois  Rabelais’  work  is  described.

because  in  this  game  we  have  not  found  documentary  evidence 
that  players  used  a  crowned  piece  by  the  name  of  dama  or  king. 


The  next  step  then  was  that  the  pawn  ounce  reaching  the  eighth 
rank  was  crowned  to  Dama  and  could  move  a  long  step  in  any 
direction.  But  again  there  are  no  written  proofs  in  this  respect. 
So  since  there  are  no  documentary  proofs,  we  can  only  guess 
how  the  different  stages  were  in  this  andarraya  game  in  the  15th 
century.  My  idea  in  1997  in  my  draughts  historical  book  that  the 
game  might  have  had  a  short  king356  was  rightly  negated  by  Dr. 
Van  der  Stoep357,  because  as  I  already  indicated  in  that  book  “It 
is  clear  that  we  need  to  find  even  more  material  as  evidence  to 
rigorously  affirm  this”.

9  ALQUERQUE-12 


9.1  Alquerque-12  links  with  the  Roman 
Empire. 

If  the  alquerque-12  game,  the  precursor  of  the  draughts  game 
had  nothing  to  do  with  Egypt  and  Greece  in  which  places  it  was 
then  played  and  what  was,  in  fact,  the  country  of  origin?  There 
are  some  vague  indications  that  Alquerque-12  could  have  been 
played  in  Roman  times.  However,  there  are  no  concrete  proofs 
of  that. 

9.1.1  The  Alquerque-12  drawing  in  Jerusalem. 

On  the  long  road  that  ascends  to  the  place  where  Jesus  Christ 
was  crucified,  known  as  “Painful  Way”  (“Way  of  sorrows”  or 
“Way  of  the  cross”),  for  this  reason,  a  clear  alquerque-12 
drawing  will  be  found  on  one  of  the  slabs  that  form  the  floor  of 
Roman  Catholic  “Chapel  of  Condemnation”.

The  chronology  that  can  be  established  for  this  drawing  would 
be  between  the  Roman  and  the  Medieval  period.  The  Spanish 
Archaeologist  Jose  Manuel  Hidalgo  Cunarro  thinks  that  the 
design  is  of  the  Roman  period. 

Roman  Period 

The  site  in  the  vicinity  of  the  church  of  Condemnation  was  in 
the  Roman  times  the  space  of  the  seat  of  Pontius  Pilate,  located 
in  the  Antonia  fortress,  and  the  status  of  the  hall  of  judgment. 
John  18:28:  "Then  they  led  Jesus  from  Caiaphas  unto  the  hall  of 
judgment".  Jesus  was  condemned  to  death  by  Pontius  Pilate,  as 
per  John  19:16 :  "Therefore,  he  delivered  him  unto  them  to  be 
crucified".  Inside  the  church  (on  its  western  ground),  and 
outside  the  chapel,  are  vast  stones,  which  were  part  of  the 
Roman  pavement  dated  to  the  2nd  C. 

Crusaders  period 

An  earlier  chapel  was  located  at  the  site  of  the  Condemnation 
chapel.  The  date  of  its  structure  is  to  the  years  1229-1244.  It 
became  ruins  in  the  13th  C.  Saint  Francis  established  the 
Franciscan  order.  He  was  an  Italian  who  lived  in  the  late  12th  C. 
The  Franciscans  presence  in  the  Holy  Land  started  in  the  first 
13th  C,  when  they  resided  in  a  small  house  (station  5)  in  via 
Dolorosa.  In  1342  Pope  Clement  VI  declared  that  the 
Franciscans  are  the  legal  custodians  of  the  Holy  places 
("Custodia  Terroe  Sanctoe").  This  custody  is  still  in  effect  to 
date. 

Late  Ottoman  period 

The  Franciscans  built  the  new  church  during  the  years  1903- 
1904,  on  the  ruins  of  the  Crusaders  chapel.  Large  Roman 
flagstones  were  discovered  under  the  ruins  and  along  the  way  to 
the  Convent  of  the  Sisters  of  Zion  -  which  is  adjacent  to  the  site. 
These  pavement  slabs  were  associated  with  the  site  of  the 


-234- 


judgment,  based  on  the  Biblical  verse  that  describes  this 
situation  {John  19:13 )  as  follows:  "Therefore,  when  Pilate  heard 
that  saying  he  brought  Jesus  forth  and  he  sat  down  in  the 
udgment  seat  in  an  area  that  is  called  the  Pavement,  but  in  the 
Hebrew,  Gabbatha358".

9.1.2  The  Alquerque-12  drawing  in  Lisbon 


In  the  Town  Museum  of  Lisbon  (Portugal)  we  can  find  a 
drawing  of  the  alquerque-12  game  on  a  lid  of  a  sarcophagus 
from  the  Roman  period  that  is  coming  from  the  St.  Jorge  Castle.

the  name  of  “Pedras  que  Jogam”  (Pieces  that  play).  Such  as  we 
can  learn  from  the  public  folder,  the  board  has  been  drawn  over 
the  Latin  letters,  and  this  is  from  a  later  period  so  that  the 
probability  of  a  true  Roman  game  is  quite  difficult.

9.1.3  The  Alquerque-12  drawing  at  Munigua  - 
Spain. 

The  boardgames  of  the  ancient  Roman  town  Munigua  -  (Mulva, 
Villanueva  del  Rio  y  Minas,  Sevilla)  were  revealed  in  1993  by 
Fernando  Fernandez  Gomez  ,  doctor  in  History. 


Dr.  Fernando  Fernandez  Gomez 

The  stone  of  the  following  photo  has  on  the  back  side  a  drawing 
of  the  boardgame  alquerque-9  (Moris  game  with  9  pieces).  On 
the  front  side,  the  stone  has  an  engraving  of  the  alquerque-12 
game.  This  nice  piece  is  now  in  the  Archaeological  Museum 
(Museo  arqueologico)  of  Sevilla.  The  interesting  fact  of  this 
stone  is  that  two  boardgames  can  simultaneously  be  exercised. 
As  reinforcement  of  a  possible  Roman  boardgame,  in  the  case 
of  alquerque-12,  it  is  necessary  to  mention  that  another 
fragment  of  a  similar  stone  was  found  of  alquerque-12.  It  was 
Dr.  Theodor  Hauschild  who  had  given  permission  to  Dr. 
Fernandez  Gomez  to  publish  the  alquerque-12  board  that  was 
found  during  excavations  by  the  Instituto  arqueologico  aleman 
de  Madrid  in  the  eighties.

Finally,  it  is  important  to  highlight  the  importance  of  these  two 
alquerque-12  boards  of  Munigua  already  in  Roman  time 
because  till  now  the  Nine  men’s  morris  and  Latrunculorum  are 
much  better  known  in  our  literature  on  this  subject.  This  could 
discard  the  widespread  idea  that  the  alquerque-12  game  would 
have  come  into  the  Iberian  Peninsula  with  the  Muslim  invasion. 
These  two  boards  could  be  the  proofs  that  the  game  already 
existed  in  Spain  before  711.  However,  to  determine  the  exact 
date  of  the  stones,  that  is  work  for  the  experts.

The  ancient  Roman  town  Munigua  (Mulva). 

Photo:  www.villanuevadelasminas.es 

Munigua  or  Mulva,  is  an  archaeological  place  located  in  the 
Sierra  Morena,  8  km  from  the  Seville  town  of  Villanueva  del 
Rio  and  Minas.  There  is  a  document  of  1537  that  already  speaks 
about  this  place,  and  also  Ambrosios  de  Morales  in  1565 
showed  interest  in  this  ancient  Roman  Town,  when  he  referred 
to  Alonso  Chacon  (1540-1599),  who360  became  reader  of 
theology  and  rector  of  the  College  of  St.  Thomas  Aquinas  at 
Sevilla.  So  there  are  strong  indications  now  that  Alonso  Chacon 
was  the  discoverer  of  this  city.  There  was  even  a  book  about

this  city  that  describes  the  research  done  in  the  years  1756 
and  1757.  It  was  investigated  again  in  1765  when  two 
researchers  at  the  Academia  de  Buenas  Letras  de  Sevilla  visited 
the  ruins,  among  them  was  Thomas  Andrew  of  Gusseme.

These  scholars  correctly  identified  this  place  as  a  sanctuary,  but 
the  popular  tradition  still  called  it  “Castle  of  Mulva”.  Munigua 
had  only  two  periods  of  occupation,  a  pre-Roman  one  since  the 
fourth  century  B.C.  that  lasts  until  the  time  of  Augustus  and 
another  fully  Roman  one,  which  extends  to  V  and  VI  century 
A.D.

The  city  had  its  peak  and  best  period  in  the  second  century,  and 
as  from  the  fourth  century  it  began  to  decline,  becoming  the 
process  of  considerable  decline  in  the  population  more  evident 
between  V  and  VI  century.  Islamic  occupation  has  been  found 
until  the  eight  century  due  to  certain  Almohad  buildings.  In 
those  years,  the  population  center  is  disappearing  from  the  area, 
abandoning  the  city.

9.1.4  The  Alquerque-12  drawing  in  Merida. 

Thanks  to  the  investigations  of  Manuel  Gumersindo  Duran 
Fuentes362  we  now  know  more  about  the  alquerque-12  game  in 
the  Roman  town  Merida.  Researchers  found  the  alquerque-12 
drawing  in  a  spill  flow  from  a  pile  of  the  Roman  bridge  of 
Merida.  Observing  the  picture  (figuring  on  page  3 1  in  the  article 
of  Duran  Fuentes)  we  observe  that  the  design  is  engraved  on  a 
large  granite  ashlar  and  that  it  is  possibly  located  in  its  original 
position.

Construction  of  this  majestic  bridge  is  one  of  the  most 
significant  deeds  for  development  and  expansion  of  Emerita 
Augusta.  In  the  following  photo  we  will  see  a  pile  of  one  of  the 
sections  of  the  bridge  on  Guadiana  river.  This  bridge  has  many 
rich  cutwaters  and  padded  ashlars.

The  problem  of  this  alquerque-12  drawing  is  that  the  area  was 
easily  accessible,  and  since  then  the  game  boards  cannot  be 
dated.  So  to  state  that  this  was  a  drawing  in  the  Roman  times  is 
something  decidedly  controversial.

9.1.5  The  Alquerque-12  drawing  in  Barcelona 

This  plateau  of  almost  complete  sandstone  originates  from  the 
San  Iu  Place  (Plaza  de  San  Lu)  in  Barcelona,  41  cm  (41  x  37  x 
10  cm)  near  to  the  cathedral  of  Barcelona.  According  to  the 

O /TO 

information  on  hand  ,  this  stone  was  found  around  the  year 
1951  and  belonged  to  the  rests  of  the  Episcopal  building 
constructed  in  the  Visigothic  period  (VI  century  A.D.). 
Currently  this  plateau  can  be  seen  in  the  Historical  and  Town 
Museum  (Museo  Historico)  of  Barcelona.  In  this  Museum,  the 
drawing  is  mentioned  under  the  names  of  “Tabula  Lusoria  or 
Tauler  de  joe  (cine  en  ratlla).

This  block  was  thought  to  be  probable  between  the  1  st  and  5th 
century  A.D.

However,  the  archaeologist,  Jose  Manuel  Hidalgo  Cunarro364 
and  Dr.  Ulricht  Schadler  think  that  the  stone  in  question 
originates  from  the  Medieval  period.  This  might  be  justified  by 
the  fact  that  Barcelona  has  many  Jewish  archaeological  remains, 
such  as  tombstones  with  Hebrew  inscriptions  that  have  been 
reused  over  time  as  building  materials  and  that  are  visible  today 
in  the  Lloctinent  Palau,  in  the  Sant  Iu  Place,  in  front  of  the  door 
to  the  patio  of  the  Museu  Mares.  The  Jews  were  already  present 
in  Barcelona  in  the  X  century.

364  One  of  the  experts  in  the  alquerque-12  drawing  is  this  Spanish 
archaeologist,  who  has  written  lately  about  it  in  different  books  and 
magazins.

After  having  rejected  the  existence  of  alquerque  12  in  Egyptian 
and  Greek  times  Dr.  Van  der  Stoep  has  doubts  about  the  Roman 
times.  The  Spanish  archaeologists  also  think  about  the  Roman 
Empire  due  to  the  fact  that  there  are  various  places  in  Israel  and 
Spain  where  drawings  of  Alquerque  12  boards  were  found  in 
ancient  Roman  towns365.  I  agree  with  the  archaeologist  Jose 
Manuel  Hidalgo  Cunarro  and  Dr.  Schadler  that  the  date  of  0- 
500  is  probably  incorrect  because  of  the  drawing  of  alquerque- 
12  on  the  sandstone  of  the  Saint  Lu  Place,  but  there  are  other 
drawings  in  Spain  from  the  Roman  Empire  period,  so  Van  der 
Stoep  is  right  to  doubt.  Doubts  are  justified  by  the  fact  that  in 
more  than  one  case  an  alquerque  9  drawing  on  a  stone  was 
found  together  with  an  alquerque  12  drawing.  On  the  other  hand 
during  the  study  of  the  alquerque  12  game  I  was  always 
confronted  with  the  alquerque  9  drawing  and  the  dating  going 
back  to  the  Roman  period.  Consequently  if  the  alquerque  9 
drawing  was  from  the  Roman  time  ,  why  could  alquerque  12 
also  not  be  from  this  period?  But  we  have  to  be  extremely 
careful  with  this  logical  thinking  and  the  possible  fact  that 
alquerque  12  was  played  in  the  Roman  time  is  work  for  the 
archaeologists. 

The  French  Institute  GERSAR  (Groupe  de  Recherches  et  de 
Sauvegarde  de  l’Art  Rupestre)  had  registered  at  the  end  of  1996 
over  a  thousand  alquerque  9  drawings  distributed  by  the

important  one  was  that  of  the  alquerque  game,  in  which  each 
player  had  12  pieces.  If  alquerque  12,  the  precursor  of  draughts, 
had  nothing  to  do  with  Egypt  and  Greece,  where  it  was  then 
played,  what  was  the  country  of  origin?  Hitherto  it  was 
generally  accepted  that  alquerque  12  came  from  the  Arab 
countries  and  that  it  was  introduced  in  Spain  after  711. 

However,  the  latest  developments  in  research  show  that  we  still 
have  to  be  careful  with  this  opinion.  The  alquerque  12  drawing 
was  found  in  Jerusalem  and  in  some  places  of  Spain  related  to 
the  Roman  Empire.  It  is  true  that  as  long  as  we  have  drawings 
on  accessible  stones  and  places  for  everybody,  it  is  really 
difficult  to  state  that  these  drawings  are  very  old,  but  it  is  also 
reasonable  to  more  carefully  study  these  events  before  forming 
a  final  opinion.

9.2  Alquerque-12  and  the  Arab  countries. 


9.2.1  The  Alquerque  games  in  the  Arab  countries. 

Hitherto,  people  accepted  that  the  alquerque-12  came  from  the 
Arab  countries  and  that  it  was  introduced  in  Spain  after  711,  but 
we  have  already  shown  that  this  was  not  true.  First  of  all  we 
study  the  word  ‘alquerque’  that  comes  from  ‘qirq’. 


Nine  men’s  Morris  (Qirq-1) 

A  script  named  Kitab  al-aghani368  (The  book  of  Songs)  of  967 
was  written  by  Abu  Al-Faraj  al-Isfahani,  who  lived  between  c. 
897  en  967.  He  was  bom  in  Isfahan,  Persia  (Iran),  but  spent  his 
childhood  and  made  his  early  studies  in  Baghdad,  Iraq.  He  was 
a  direct  descendant  of  the  last  of  the  Umayyad  caliphs,  Marwan 
II.  Abu  Al-Faraj  al-Isfahani,  connected  with  the  Umayyad 
rulers  in  Spain,  had  kept  up  a  correspondence  with  them  and  to

have  sent  them  some  of  his  works.  He  spent  his  later  life  in 
various  parts  of  the  Islamic  world,  in  Aleppo  with  its  governor 
Sayf  ad-Dawlah,  to  whom  he  dedicated  the  Book  of  Songs.

The  collection  of  his  books  consisted  of  24  volumes  and  was 
recovered  in  the  19th  century  by  the  Englishman  Edward  Lane. 
Fiske369  studied  this  work  and  refers  to  qirq,  a  term  used  in  one 
of  these  books,  where  it  is  mentioned  that  an  inhabitant  of 
Mecca  kept  sets  of  chess,  nard,  and  qirq  for  this  quests’ 
entertainment.

Another  board  of  Nine  men’s  Morris  (Qirq-2). 


However,  in  this  case  we  have  to  do  with  the  game  three  in  a 
row  (Nine  men’s  Morris)  and  not  with  the  alquerque-12  game. 
It  can  be  understood  from  a  paragraph  of  Ibn  Abdun  of  Evora 
(d.  1135)  that  playing  chess,  nard,  and  qirq  as  well  as  using 
divination  arrows  by  means  of  gambling  constituted  forbidden 
activities,  since  all  that  distracted  an  individual  from  fulfilling 
his  religious  duties370. 

It  is  clear  that  at  that  time  more  than  one  player  sometimes  lost 
their  latest  dirham  .  There  does  not  exist  any  drawing  of  the 
board  in  question,  but  surely  Ibn  Abdun  refers  to  the  three  in  a

Mohammed  B.  Ya’qub  al-Fayruzabadi  (1326-1414)  composed 
this  Arab  dictionary.  Today  this  term  cannot  be  found  any  more 
in  the  modem  Arab  dictionaries  and  is  replaced  by  the  word 
dris313.  However  the  name  ‘qirq’  or  ‘qriq”  was  retained  by  the 
Berber  of  the  High  Atlas  in  Morocco  until  today374.  Khan375 
gives  another  reference  from  al-Lissan  al-Arab  al-Muhayeet, 
Yol.  3,  p.  69: 

Abus  Issaq  al-Harbi  mentioned  ‘Al-Qirq’  with  reference  to  Abu 
Hurayrah  (one  of  Prophet  Mohammad’s  companions)  that  it  was  a 
game  played  in  Hejaz  and  was  called  ‘Al-Qirq’.  It  consisted  of  a  large 
square  and  another  square  inside  it  and  another  square  inside  and  the 
lines  of  each  side  of  the  squares  were  cut  by  a  straight  line  and  each 
angle  of  the  square  was  jointed  by  a  line  so  that  twenty  four  line 
(crossings)  were  created  in  the  game.

There  are  also  other  game  boards  incised  in  a  horizontal 
position  on  the  upper  ranks  of  the  theatre  and  on  the  wall  of  the 
Cistern  built  by  the  Romans  from  village  basalt377.  As  these 
locations  have  been  easily  accessible,  since  then,  the  game 
boards  cannot  be  dated.

all  these  boards  were  made  by  the  Romans  between  A.D.  106 
and  634.  Alternatively  Arabs  could  have  made  them.  So  far  we 
can  see  in  these  references  that  there  are  no  Arab  references 
outside  Spain  to  the  alquerque-12  drawings.  Thus,  it  might  be 
possible  that  indeed  the  alquerque-12  game  had  to  do  with  the 
Roman  Empire  and  not  with  the  Arab  culture.  This  is  quite 
different  from  what  the  researcher  Jose  M.  Espinel  Cejas379  is 
claiming,  but  he  was  not  able  to  demonstrate  the  necessary 
documentary  proofs,  only  vague  verbal  indications  to  the  High

9.2.3  Doubtful  Alquerque-12  drawings  in  Europe. 

9.2.3.1  Spain,  the  first  European  country 

As  far  is  known,  Spain  was  the  earliest  European  country  were 
the  alquerque-12  was  found.  Did  the  alquerque-12  game,  such 
as  found  in  Spain  in  the  Roman  towns,  came  from  Jerusalem  or 
other  Arabic  countries  or  was  it  a  game  that  developed  in  Spain 
during  the  occupation  of  the  Romans?  Hitherto,  we  are  unable 
to  respond  to  this. 

9.2.3.2  Esotermism 

However,  we  have  to  be  cautious  in  considering  all  alquerque- 
12  drawings  as  a  board  game.  There  are  many  vertical  drawings 
of  alquerque-12  that  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  board  game 
since  they  were  used  for  another  meaning380.

9.3  Theories  on  the  Alquerque-12 


There  are  many  theories  regarding  the  game  of  alquerque.  All 
checkers  historians  always  evoke  the  old  game  of  Alquerque- 
12,  as  described  by  King  Alfonso  X  the  Wise  in  his  book384. 

9.3.1  1890  Joseph  Brunet  and  Belief 

In  his  book  Joseph  Brunet  and  Bellet  (1818-1905)  made  a 
drawing  of  an  alquerque  game  with  12  pieces.  The  historian 
said  the  following385: 

(....)  and  it  is  possible  and  almost  probable  that  the  checkers  played 
with  12  white  and  12  black  pieces  in  Spain  (in  France  and  other 
countries  it’s  played  with  more  pieces)  is  nothing  but  the  old  mallet 
applied  to  the  8x8  chessboard  when  the  game  was  popularized  in 
the  West. 

Therefore  the  Spaniard  Brunet  and  Bellet  was  the  first  one  to 
think  that  the  alquerque  of  12  may  have  been  a  precursor  to 
checkers. 


9.3.2  1912  William  Shelley  Branch 

William  Shelley  Branch  (1854-1933)  believed  that  the  game 
passed  to  a  chessboard  around  1300  and  thus  began  the 
crowning.  This  author  wrote  about  the  old  checkers  in  the

Tablas..  Reprint  Madrid,  1987.

Philippines  that’s  played  on  a  board  of  lines.  This  way  he  could 

O  O  /T 

build  the  following  hypothesis  on  the  origin  of  checkers  : 

Checkers  can  be  played  on  a  board  of  lines  like  alquerque.  It  is  a 
form  of  alquerque,  changed  from  the  more  ancient  variety  by  reason 
of  having  been  played  on  the  chessboard  with  a  different  arrangement 
of  the  men  in  order  to  make  them  run  on  lines  of  the  same  colored 
squares.  This  provided  the  difference  between  single  and  double 
corner.  To  put  it  another  way,  the  old  alquerque  as  described  in  the 
MS  Alfonso  was  our  game  of  drafts  in  an  early  stage. 

In  the  history  of  checkers  almost  no  attention  is  paid  to  Branch 
who  had  a  chesscolumn  in  the  Cheltenham  Examiner  from 
November  1890  to  December  25,  1913  (the  closure  of  the 
newspaper),  a  time  at  which  the  section  was  still  in  the 
Cheltenham  and  Gloucestershire  Graphic  Chronicle  from  28 
February  1914  until  his  death  (January  22,  1933).  Apparently  he 
also  wrote  in  the  Cheltenham  Free  Press  under  the  pseudonym 
of  "Douglas".  In  these  columns  he  often  wrote  about  the  history 
of  checkers  .  Branch  wrote  in  The  Draughts  World 
(December,  1903,  issue  3:  222),  a  monthly  newsletter  that  was 
published  in  Glasgow,  which  was  in  contact  with  H.J.R  Murray 
and  referring  to  it  he  said:  (,.)He  can  read  ancient  manuscripts 
in  Arabic,  Latin,  Norman-French,  German,  Etc.  and  has  some 
copies  of  all  those  dealing  with  chess  -some  of  the  tenth  century, 
etc.  Incidentally  he  has  got  to  know  more  than  anyone  else 
about  boardgames  in  general  of  before  the  modem  period.  He 
gives  “about  1300  A.D.  ”  as  the  date  for  the  origin  of  the  game 
of  draughts  as  known  in  England  in  1380,  and  the  country  of 
origin  -Spain.  I  agree  with  him.

It  is  interesting  to  reflect  here  the  fact  that  Murray  (initially) 
thought  of  Spain.  There  is  no  doubt  that  Murray  had  to  use 
much  of  Branch’s  initial  research,  but  he  did  not  even  mention  it 
anywhere  and  this  caused  Branch’s  name  to  unfairly  and 
unfortunately  fall  into  oblivion. 

9.3.3  1952  Murray 

The  conclusion  that  ferses  was  draughts  seems  inevitable,  and 
the  life  of  the  name  ferses,  c  1150-1400,  confirms  this 
conclusion.  What  then  were  its  parents?  Undoubtedly  one 
parent  was  chess  which  provided  the  board  and  the  name  of  the 
draughtsmen,  fers  as  long  as  it  was  used  in  chess,  then  its 
successor  in  French,  dame  and  after  the  death  of  the  medieval 
chess,  peon  in  Spanish,  pion  in  French,  and  pedina  in  Italian. 
The  other  parent  seems  to  have  been  alquerque,  which 
provided  the  number  of  men  and  the  method  of  capture. 

According  to  Murray  the  alquerque  was  a  kind  of  checkers 
game  with  no  crowning.  Checkers  originated  by  adding  the 
crowning  taken  from  chess.  This  happened  in  the  eleventh 
century  in  southern  France.  Checkers  is  a  cross  between  two 
other  games,  known  as  chess  and  alquerque.  Checkers  was 
created  when  the  crowning  was  added  to  the  medieval  board 
game,  the  alquerque388. 


9.3.4  1966  Kruijswijk 

Kruijswijk  sort  of  followed  Murray,  but  forwarded  the  period  a 
century  ahead  and  according  to  Kruijswijk  the  alquerque  never 
knew  the  crowning:

Alquerque  Laat  niet  met  zich  damspel  vereenzelvigen,  want  het  voor 
de  speelfiguren  in  alquerquespel  is  de  kans  op  niet  promotie 
weggelegd389. 

Loose  translation: 

Alquerque  cannot  be  identified  with  checkers,  because  the  fate 
of  the  crowning  has  not  been  reserved  in  the  game. 


9.3.5  1981  Dr.  Arie  van  der  Stoep 

Checkers  is  exactly  the  same  game  as  the  medieval  alquerque 
game  -  that  means,  both  games  knew  crowning,  but  passing 
from  a  striped  board  (alquerque)  to  a  chequered  board390.  Van 
der  Stoep  argued  in  a  letter  that  checkers  was  played  in  Spain 
in  1283  on  an  alquerque  board,  thus  using  crowning. 


9.3.6  1989  Govert  Westerveld 

In  a  long  letter  dated  05/30/1989  he  informed  Van  der 
Stoep  that  alquerque,  as  it  was  indicated  by  King  Alfonso  X  the 
Wise  in  1283,  had  nothing  to  do  with  checkers,  but  that  it  was 
only  a  precursor  of  it.  There  were  still  more  facts  to  defend  his 
position  in  a  better  way,  but  the  time  were  not  very  conducive  to 
this.

Checkers  originated  when  a  crowning  queen  (queen)  was 
attributed  to  the  pawns  in  the  medieval  board  game  of 
alquerque,  inspired  by  chess.  This  happened  in  the  16th  century 
in  Spain.  Bakker  flatly  declares  that  alquerque  did  not  know  the 
crowning:

Acedrex  Books  (Alfonso  X  the  Wise).

variant:  Querque  (Alcala,  1505),  which  should  well  refer  to  this 
game,  since  PalC.  follows  Nebrija’s  nomenclature  and  it  only 
records  alquerque,  calculorum  ludus". 


Also  the  Portuguese  word  alguergue.  The  English  qualification 
that  Guevara397  (1539)  applies  to  alquerque  should  not  be  taken 
literally.

Nowadays  the  alquerque  is  the  space  at  the  oil  mills,  in  which 
after  the  first  squeezing  the  pomace  crumbles  to  extract  the 
oil.  Specifically  this  part  of  the  oil  mill  is  formed  by  a  channel 
of  geometric  system  of  lines.  Therefore  it  is  likely  that  the 
popularity  of  this  game  gave  the  name  to  the  oil  mill  and  not 
vice  versa.  In  other  languages  we  can  also  see  the  use  of  the 
mill,  such  as  in  German  -  Miihle,  Dutch  -  molenspel,  Danish  - 
nolle  and  Swedish  -qvarn.

Wise399.  Could  you  perhaps  refer  fazer  ferred  (a  jump  or  the 
capture  of  an  opponent's  piece)  to  the  mechanism  in  the  oil  mill 
in  which  the  second  squeezing  takes  place? 

Dozy400  says  that  alquerque  is  of  uncertain  origin;  as 
the  Acad401  and  Eguilaz402,  alquerque  could  come  from  qaraq  or 
qariq  -  a  flat  and  smooth  place,  only  in  Freytag403  the  word  is 
attributed  to  the  same  source.  We  could  not  consult  Dozy404 
and  Schiaparelli405. 

The  etymology  of  the  word  alquerque  is  misleading.  It  probably 
originates  from  the  Arabic  word  qirq,  quirqa.  I  think  it  is  of 
Arabic-Spanish  origin,  because  the  Moors  played  this  game406

since  the  eighth  century  in  Spain  and  they  had  their  own 
language.  Murray  (1952:  37)  failed  to  find  alquerque  in  Arabic, 
but  we  still  need  to  know  whether  he  researched  well  enough 
and  studied  the  Arabic  literature  of  Spain407.  The  Moors  enjoyed 
playing  this  game  in  Spain,  and  logically  it  is  more  convenient 
to  search  the  origin  of  the  word  first  in  Spanish-Moorish  and  not 
in  Latin.  The  word  is  in  the  Quamus  dictionary408,  in  the 
dictionnary  of  Pedro  de  Alcala409  and  Lopez  Tamar  id410.  More 
research  is  needed,  and  we  cannot  exclude  what  Van  der 
Stoep411  wrote  about  Zamboni412.  This  linguist  says: 

er  zijn  geen  Arabische  bewijsplaatsen  alquerque  met  in  er  is  geen  zou 
het  Arabisch  woord  waarop  kunnen  teruggaan  Het  komt  voor  alleen 
in  Spanje..  De  Spaanse  woordvoorraad  is  vooral  Latijns,  Sp. 
Alquerque  teruggaan  kan  op  Lat.  Calcul  (us)  want  is  in  LR  wisseling

There  are  not  any  Arab  evidential  texts  about  alquerque,  nor  an

Four  alquerque  boards  together  that  form  8x8  squares  were 
found  in  the  plate  closing  the  roof  of  the  temple  of  Kuma  in 
Egypt,  which  is  dated  to  the  14th  century  BC.  This  way  the 
alquerque  board  formed  a  chessboard413.  (Subsequently  revoked 
by  Murray). 

A  writing  in  Kitab  al-Aghani  in  967  mentions  an  inhabitant  in 
Mecca  who  kept  chess  games  (ASJ-sjatranjat),  board  games 
(an-nardat),  and  alquerque  games  (qirqat)  at  home  for 
entertainment  of  his  guests414. 

As  it  can  be  inferred  from  a  sentence  by  Ibn  Abdun,  a  type  of 
alquerque  game  (qirq)  was  practiced  in  the  12th  century  in 
Sevilla,  and  certainly  in  the  rest  of  Andalucia  on  which  fans 
sometimes  played  passionately  their  last  dirham415.  Ibn 
Abdun’s  work  has  been  quoted  in  literature  several  times416.

The  alquerque  board,  with  an  initial  placement  of  12  pieces  on 
both  sides,  was  first  found  in  an  image  from  an  English 
manuscript  originally  from  Cerne  Abbey,  Dorsetshire.  The 
manuscript  was  written  in  the  second  half  of  the  13th  century 
and  is  preserved  in  Trinity  College,  Cambridge417. 

In  the  Qamus  dictionary  the  word  alquerque  is  found  next  to  an 
image  of  the  most  used  boards  by  then418.  Today  this  word  is  no 
longer  found  in  modern  Arabic  dictionaries  and  has  been 
replaced  by  the  word  Dris419 . 

In  Saint  Mary  of  Cavendish’s  Church,  Suffolk,  an  alquerque 
board  was  drawn  on  a  burial  in  1570420.

9.5  Descriptions  of  Alquerque  in  literature 
9.5.1  1250  Vetula 

The  first  mention  of  alquerque  is  found  in  a  Latin  work  from  the  first 
part  of  the  13th  century.  It  is  known  by  us  as:  De  Vetula 421  and  it  is 
attributed  to  Richard  of  Fournival  (c  1200  -  c  1254).  This  paper  refers 

422 

to  alquerque  and  mill  with  respectively  12  and  9  pieces

other  times  twelve  are  captured  in  a  board,  and  when 
there  are  twelve,  the  enemy  piece  is  taken  jumping 
above  it.  It  is  not  even  mandatory  to  throw  a  dice. 

However,  when  there  are  nine  of  them,  it  is  actually  played  with  a 
dice  and  it  is  over  whenever  you  want  it  to  be.

9.5.3  1283  King  Alfonso  X  the  Wise 

The  wisdom  recognized  in  the  peaceful  King  Alfonso  X  the 
Wise  was  undoubtedly  rooted  in  the  spread  of  oriental  culture 
not  only  in  Spain,  but  throughout  the  West.  The  Castilian  king 
in  his  time  was  able  to  gather  around  him  the  most  specialized 
Christian,  Jewish,  and  Arab  intellectual  world  and  thus  wise 
beautiful  manuscripts  were  written.  One  was  an  important  work 
discussing  games425.

Here  we  reflect  the  text  as  King  Alfonso  X  the  Wise  discusses  it 
in  his  work  in  relation  to  alquerque  : 

Este  es  ell  alquerque  de  doze  que  iuega  con  todos  sus  trebeios: 

Pves  fablado  auemos  en  los  libros  desuso  de  todas  las  maneras  de  los 
iuegos  dell  acedrex  e  de  los  dados  e  delas  tablas,  segunt  aquellos  tres 
sabios  dieron  la  muestra  al  rey,  e  depues  los  departieron  los  omnes 
sabidores  de  iogar,  queremos  agora  aqui  dezir  de  otros  iuegos  que 
fallaron  depues  los  omnes,  que  non  son  encuenta  destos  sobredichos, 
e  pero  an  parte  en  ellos,  assi  como  los  alquerques  que  tannen  all 
acedrex  e  a  las  tablas  e  a  los  dados.  E  tales  y  a  que  tannen  all  acedrex 
e  a  las  tablas,  e  no  a  los  dados.  E  comencaremos  primeramientre  en 
ell  alquerque  de  doze  por  que  es  mayor  de  todos  los  otros  alquerques, 
e  se  iuega  con  mas  trebeios.  Et  diremos  en  quantas  maneras  se  iuega  e 
con  quantos  trebeios,  e  por  qual  razon  ha  en  el  parte,  acedrex  e  tablas 
e  dados.  Ell  acedrex  ha  en  ell  parte  por  que  se  iuega  por  seso,  e  ell 
alquerque  otrossi,  e  los  trebeios  con  que  se  iuega  semeian  a  los 
peones  dell  acedrex. 

E  a  las  tablas:  por  el  mannar  que  se  mannan  el  iuego,  segundo  el  suyo, 
e  por  las  sennales  o  ponen  los  trebeios.  E  han  y  parte  los  dados  por  la 
uentura,  ca  assi  como  lancan  en  auentura  los  dados  en  el  tablero,  a  qui 
haya  la  mano,  assi  echan  en  el  alquerque  suertes  otrossi  en  auentura 
qui  iuegue  primero.  E  iuegasse  en  esta  manera:  en  ell  alquerque  ha  de 
auer  ueynt  y  cinco  logares  do  se  puedan  poner  los  trebeios,  e  los 
trebeios  an  a  seer  ueynt  y  quatro,  e  ponen  los  doze  duna  color  dun 
cabo  e  los  otros  doze  dell  otra  cabo  en  az.

The  alquerque-12  game  of  King  Alfonso  X  the  Wise 


E  finca  un  logar  uazio  en  medio  poro  se  cometa  el  iuego.  E  el  que  ha 
la  mano,  ha  peoria,  por  que  ha  de  iogar  por  fuerca  en  aquel  logar 
uazio.  Et  pon  ell  otro  iogador  el  su  trebeio  en  aquel  mismo  logar 
ondel  salio,  e  lieua  aquel  que  mouio  primero,  passando  sobre  duna 
casa  a  otra  enderecho,  segunt  ua  la  raya  derecha  dell  alquerque,  e 
sobre  quantos  trebeios  assi  passsare  todos  los  leuara,  e  esso  mismo 
fara  ell  otro  iogador.  Et  toda  uia  el  que  ouo  la  mano,  ha  de  mouer 
primero  guisando  como  lieue  algun  trebeio  de  los  dell  otra  parte. 


-277  - 


Et  ell  otro  iogador  guardasse  muy  meior  por  y,  ca  entiendo  el  iuego 
quel  quiere  fazer,  guarda  el  su  trebeio  por  y  meior,  e  faz  le  esso 
mismo  que  ell  otro  cueyda  a  el  fazer,  e  por  esta  razon  ha  peoria  el  que 
ha  la  mano.  Et  el  que  peor  guarda  sus  trebeios  e  los  mas  ayna  pierde, 
es  uengudo.  Et  si  amos  los  iogadores  lo  sopieren  iogar, 
comunalmientre  puede  se  mannar.  Et  esta  es  la  figura  dell  alquerque  e 
delos  juegos  e  de  como  estan  puestos  en  sus  casas. 

Loose  translation: 

This  is  the  Alquerque- 12  played  with  all  its  chessmen  (pieces): 

So  we  will  have  spoken  in  the  books  about  the  use  of  all  manner  of 
chess  games  and  the  dice  and  tables,  as  shown  by  those  three  wise 
men  brought  to  the  king  and  then  taught  the  knowledgeable  people  to 
play,  now  we  want  to  talk  here  about  other  games  found  after  the 
men,  who  were  not  taken  into  account  but  somehow  depend  on 
them.  We’ll  start  with  the  Alquerque- 12,  because  it  is  the  greatest  of 
all  the  other  alquerques,  and  it  is  played  with  more  pieces.  And  we 
will  explain  in  what  ways  you  play  it  and  with  how  many  pieces,  and 
why  it  is  somehow  part  of  chess.  This  is  because  it  is  played  with  the 
head,  and  the  pieces  are  similar  to  the  chess  pawns. 

And  they  have  their  luck  in  the  dice,  since  the  dice  that  is  thrown  on 
the  board  decides  who  opens  the  game.  And  it  must  be  played  like 
this:  There  must  be  twenty-five  holes  (squares)  where  you  can  place 
the  pieces,  which  have  to  be  twenty.  Then  put  twelve  of  one  color  on 
one  side  and  the  other  twelve  on  the  other  side  respectively  grouped. 
An  empty  place  in  the  middle  where  the  game  starts  is  left.  The  one 
that  plays  first  has  it  worse,  because  he  mandatorily  has  to  play  over 
that  empty  hole.  And  the  other  player  puts  his  piece  on  the  same  hole 
that  his  opponent  formerly  was,  then  releases  (the  one)  who  moved 
first,  moving  from  one  square  to  the  other  one  ahead,  and  jumping 
over  all  the  pieces  this  way  he  will  take  all  of  them  out  (removing 
them  from  the  board),  and  so  will  do  the  other  player.  And  so  on,  the 
one  in  power  must  move  first  capturing  whenever  he  can  the  other 
pieces. 

The  other  player  must  beware  as  much  as  possible,  understanding  the 
moves  he  wants  to  make,  doing  the  best  to  keep  his  pawns,  and  do  the 
same  thing  the  other  does  to  capture  his  pieces,  and  this  is  the  reason 
why  the  first  player  has  it  worse.  And  the  one  that  fails  at  saving  his 


-278  -

know  how  to  play,  they  could  engage.  And  this  is  the  figure  of

Alquerque-12 


The  Alquerque-12  game  was  played  this  way: 

1 .  The  tablet  has  25  points  of  intersection. 

2.  Each  player  has  12  paws,  2  rows  of  5  squares,  and  a  third  row 
with  the  right  2  squares. 

3.  In  the  center  of  the  board  there  is  a  vacant  intersection  point. 

4.  The  dice  determine  who  opens  the  game. 

5.  Capturing  is  required  both  in  orthogonal  and  diagonal

and  back. 

Alquerque  12  was  already  an  old  game,  but  it  is  strange  to 
observe  that  only  King  Alfonso  X  of  Castile  transmitted  the 
rules  of  the  game  to  us,  because  the  Bonus  Socius  and  the  Civis 
Bononiae  Manuscripts  only  contain  collections  of  problems  of 
the  game428. 


9.5.4  1432  Juan  Alfonso  de  Baena 

Juan  Alfonso  de  Baena  (1406-1454)  was  a  Spanish  writer  bom 
in  Baena.  He  belonged  to  a  Jewish  family,  but  later  turned  to  the 
Catholic  religion  and  the  King  John  II  of  Castile  named  him  his 
secretary.  One  of  his  most  important  works  is  the  Cancionero 
de  Baena  which  was  published  in  1499.  He  was  friends  with  the 
Constable  of  Alvaro  de  Luna  by  then  and  other  important 
members  of  the  Court.  These  people  spent  their  poems  in  the 
form  of  rogatory.

9.5.5  1495  Antonio  de  Nebrija 

He  was  a  Spanish  performer  bom  in  1444  in  Nebrija  and  died  in 
1522.  He  spent  many  years  in  Italy  studying  the  ancient  Latin 
and  Greek  languages.  After  his  return  he  became  a  professor  of 
Latin  in  Salamanca  and  later  in  Alcala  de  Henares.  He  also 
mastered  the  Hebrew  language  and  was  one  of  the  most 
prominent  humanists  in  the  15th  century.  His  knowledge  of 
Latin  could  not  be  reached  by  anyone  at  the  time.  Nebrija  had  a 
broad  knowledge  in  many  sciences.  He  wrote  many  works. 

Nebrija  (1495)  supports  this  word  in  his  dictionary  and  made  it 
famous  as  follows:

9.5.6  1517  Hernando  Alonso  de  Herrera 


Hernando  Alonso  de  Herrera  was  a  Spanish  humanist  who  lived 
in  the  15th  and  16th  centuries.  Bom  around  1460  in  Talavera  de 
la  Reina,  he  probably  went  to  the  University  of  Salamanca, 
where  Nebrija  was  teaching.  For  some  years  he  taught  grammar 
and  rhetoric  at  the  University  of  Alcala  de  Henares  until  he  left 
in  1513.  He  also  taught  rhetoric  in  1517  at  the  University  of 
Salamanca.  He  continued  living  in  this  city  until  his  death  in 
1528.  Many  works  appeared  in  his  hands430. 

One  of  his  works  was:  Disputatio  adversus  Aristotelem 
aristotelicos-que  sequaces.  This  work  was  dedicated  to  Cardinal 
Ximenes  and  is  bilingual.  The  Latin  text  is  on  even  pages  and 
the  Castilian  text  on  odd  pages. 

Adolfo  Bonilla  and  San  Martin  dedicated  deep  and  scholarly 
research  to  this  writer431.

coloribus,  lusus  haec  ars  est,  ut,  comprehensis  duobus

IV :  Nam  illarum  unaquaeque  plurimae  sunt  civitates,  non 
civitas,  quemadmodum  dicere  solent  ludentes.  Refert 
Zenodotus,  quanquam  idem  adagii  sensum  non  indicat.

Loose  translation: 

We  practice  the  game  of  cities. 

We  played  with  cities.  This  is  a  kind  of  game  that  was 
played  in  ancient  times  with  pieces  that  the  ancients  called 
poleis,  and  modem  chorai  places.  The  adagium 
used  Cratinus  with  ts  refugees.  According  to  the  passage 
that,  if  I'm  not  mistaken,  Julius  Pollux  quoted  in  his  9th 
Book:  A  city  of  an  extraordinary  praising  King;  You 
know  what  we  mean,  dog  and  city,  the  game  described  as 
follows  what  the  game  is: 

The  game  played  with  many  pieces  required  a  board  with 
places  (tables),  which  were  on  stripes.  Game  pieces  are 
divided  by  color  into  two  parts  and  the  technique  of  the 
game  is  to  capture  a  piece  of  a  color  between  two  pieces 
of  another  color  and  remove  the  board. 

Plato  refers  to  the  saying  in  Book  4  of  the  Republic,  each 
of  which  has  a  large  number  of  towns  and  not  a  city,  as 
people  say  when  playing  the  game.  The  game 


-287  - 


Zenodotus  is  mentioned,  but  does  not  indicate  what 
adagium  means,  and  therefore  each  is  free  to  determine 
what  approximates  the  truth  most  closely.  I  think  it  refers 
to  a  situation  where  everyone  stands  with  all  the  means  at 
its  disposal  its  own  interests  and  where  it  can  get  traps  for 
your  enemies  and  opponents.  This  type  of  game  is  widely 
practiced  in  the  courts  of  kings  and  among  people  in 
government  service.  The  game  seems  to  be  a  forerunner 
of  what  is  today  called  the  game  of  chess.

He  was  a  Spanish  prelate  and  writer  bom  in  Treceno  (Asturias) 
in  1480?  and  died  in  Valladolid  in  1545.  His  father  took  him  to 
the  court  of  the  Catholic  Monarchs  when  he  was  only  12  years 
old.  Many  years  later  he  became  Carlos  V’s  preacher, 
counselor,  and  writer.  As  if  this  was  not  enough,  he  was  also  the 
inquisitor  of  Valencia,  Bishop  of  Gaudix  and  Mondonedo 
afterwards.  Therefore  this  writer  was  a  person  of  great 
reputation  and  had  great  benefits. 

This  author  mentioned  the  following  phrase  in  one  of  his 
books433: 

Los  viejos  jugauan  a  los  dados  por  la  pla?as,  las  mugeres  jugauan  al

9.5.11  1558,  Cristobal  de  Villalon 

Cristobal  de  Villalon  (1505-1558)  was  a  Spanish  writer  born  in 
Villalon  or  in  Valbuena  de  Duero  in  the  early  sixteenth  century. 
He  studied  at  the  University  of  Alcala  de  Henares,  where  he 
learned  Greek  and  theology,  without  ordaining  himself  as  a 
priest.  From  1530-1545  he  worked  probably  for  a  time  as  a 
professor  at  the  University  of  Valladolid,  retiring  in  1557  to  a 
small  town  to  write  his  last  book  Spanish  Grammar.  1558  is 
usually  indicated  as  the  year  of  his  death.  We  find  in  his  book 
The  Scholastico437  what  follows: 

II,  cap.  17:  (...)  De  los  inventores  de  los  juegos.  Pelota.  Lucha. 
Naypes.  Axedrez.  Camicoles.  Los  Dados.  Alquerque.  Xaldeta.

incomparable  work  with  the  fight  game  and  punaceste  the  invention: 
and  being  on  Troy  by  Palamedes  spending  long  siege  invention  the 
cards:  Mangrolina  played  chess  so  cleverly  without  even  seeing  the 
board,  alone  in  a  room  with  great  players.  The  Greeks  invented  the 
game  of  camicoles;  Mauros  invented  the  game  of  craps:  the  Spanish 
invented  the  Alquerque  called  by  another  name  Castro;  they  also 
invented  the  Jaldeta. 

Castro  was  in  Spain  at  that  time  the  name  for  the  mill.  We  know 
this  thanks  to  the  famous  manuscript  of  King  Alfonso  X  the 
Wise  which  named  this  game  Alquerque  9.  The  description  by 
Cristobal  de  Villalon  is  confusing,  because  it  presents  the  game 
alquerque  9  (Castro)  as  if  it  were  a  Spanish  invention.  However, 
this  game  of  mill  was  already  a  very  old  game.  Also  see  Castro.

Juan  de  Cordova  (1503-1595)  was  a  Spanish  philologist  and 
writer.  He  was  born  in  Cordoba  in  1503  and  died  in  Oajaca 
(Mexico)  in  1595.  After  studying  Latin  he  embraced  the 
profession  of  arms,  but  in  1543  decided  to  enter  the  convent  of 
San  Domingo  and  was  ordained  priest  in  1548.  Linguist  and 
priest  who  lived  half  his  life  in  Mexico  made  a  vocabulary  of 
the  indigenous  language  and  we  know444:

Francisco  Sanchez  de  las  Brozas  (1523-1600),  known  as 
Brocense,  was  a  benedictine  monk,  Portuguese.  He  professed  in 
Montserrat  in  1577.  He  died  there  in  1604.  He  was  versed  in  the 
Sacred  Scriptures  and  in  Hebrew,  leaving  at  least  a  dozen 
documents,  among  them  a  Hebrew  dictionary  and  the  work 
Commentarium  in  Ecclesiastem  cum  Concordia  Vulgate

The  importance  of  the  ideas  of  el  Brocense  in  the  reform  of 
classical  studies  in  Spain  is  in  the  mid- 16th  century  comparable 
to  that  of  Antonio  de  Nebrija  at  the  beginning  of  the  century.  He 
was  very  skilled  in  the  Sacred  Scripture  and  Hebrew  and  had  a 
dozen  works,  which  include  a  Hebrew  dictionary.  He  wrote  a 
work  about  the  “Spanish  etymologies”,  which  was  never 
published446.  For  him  the  word  “Alquerque”  was  of  Arab  origin. 

Alquerque  =  Arabic  querque

Freigino  was  bom  in  Freiburg  in  1543  and  died  in  Basilea  in 
1583.  In  1567  he  became  Doctor  in  Philology  and  Law.  He  was 
also  Professor  in  Basilea  and  Freiburg  and  in  favor  of  the 
scientific  theory  of  the  Huguenots  Ramus.  Freigiuno  was 
suspected  of  being  associated  with  Protestantism.

From  the  text  that  hereafter  follows,  it  can  be  deduced  that 
alquerque  and  marro  (de  punta)  were  the  same  line  games.

From  him  we  know  the  following450: 

Alquerque 

En  arab.  es  juego,  quizas  corrupto  de  calculo  lat.  o  calces,  segun 
Lucilio ,  como  nota  festo.  Franceses  e  italianos  llaman  scalculo  y  nos 
otros  escaque,  fmgiendo  un  verbo  excalculari,  como  en  Varron 
excuriari  y  excuncari  y  descaminar  que  decimos  en  las  rayas  de  los 
Reinos.  Y  asi  dice  Scaligero  que  los  espanoles  fmgimos  el  vocablo 
axedrez,  como  exquadri,  perdida  la  silaba  de  enmedio,  porque 
esquadrones  y  quadras  son  companias  de  gente  de  guerra,  y  el  juego 
de  axedrez  no  es  otra  cosa  que  un  real  o  exercito  y  campo  formado. 

Loose  translation: 

In  Arabic  it  is  the  name  of  a  game,  maybe  the  mutilated  shape 
of  the  Latin  calculo  or  calces,  according  to  Lucilio,  as  nota  festo.  The 
French  and  Italians  call  it  scalculo  and  we  call  it  escaque,  pretending 
a  verb  excalculari,  like  Varro  excuriari  and  excuncari  and 
misdirecting  that  we  say  in  the  lines  (ways)  of  the  kingdoms.  So 
Scaligero  says  that  the  Spaniards  think  the  word  chess,  as  axedrez 
exquadri ,  by  loss  of  the  middle  syllable  because  troops  and  quadres 
are  companies  of  war  figures,  and  nothing  else  than  a  king’s  army  or 
army  and  formed  camp. 


9.5.20  1603  Francisco  de  Luque  Faxardo 

This  author  also  includes  the  word  alquerque  in  his  book  of 
games  and  leaves  to  the  women  the  choice  of  the  name  Damas 
instead  of  the  alquerque  game451.

9.5.22  1608  Diego  Gonzalez  Holguin 


Diego  Gonzalez  Holguin  (1552  -  1620)  was  a  Spanish 
missionary  and  linguist  who  was  bom  in  Caceres  in  1552  and 
died  around  1620  in  Lima,  Peru.  He  was  a  Spanish  Jesuit  priest, 
researcher  of  the  Quechua  language  during  the  times  of  the 
Viceroyalty  of  Peru.  In  1581  he  was  sent  to  Peru  and  studied  the 
Quechua  language  for  25  years  in  the  city  of  Cusco.  By  1607 
he  published  in  Lima454  his  Grammar  and  Arts  of  the  General 
Language  of  Peru,  a  year  later  the  Vocabulary  of  the  General 
Language  of  the  Entire  Peru,  the  first  dictionary  of  the  Quechua 
of  Cusco.  Thus  we  see  in  one  of  his  works455:

(Covarrubias,  1611): 

Alquerque  es  un  juego  de  piedrecillas,  sobre  un  tablero  rayado  que 
haze  diversos  quadros,  y  por  las  rayas  van  moviendose,  y  quando 
hallan  tercera  casa  vacia  del  contrario,  passan  a  ella,  ganandole  la

Loose  translation: 

Alquerque  is  a  game  of  little  stones  over  a  stripped  board,  making 
different  squares  and  for  the  stripe  the  player  goes  moving  and  when 
they  find  the  contender's  third  house  empty,  go  there,  winning  the 
stone  which  was  placed  in  the  middle  and  which  sometimes  can  be 
two  or  three.  If  being  able  to  take  it  he  refuses  to  do  it,  he  will  lose  his 
own  by  blowing.  This  game  is  called  schyraphia  in  Greek.

9.5.24  1612  Ludovico  Bertonio 


Ludovico  Bertonio  (1552-1625)  was  an  Italian  Jesuit,  named  the 
insurmountable  Aymara,  and  the  most  notable  linguist  of  the 
colonial  era.  In  1574  he  joined  the  Jesuits  and  four  years  later  he 
was  assigned  to  the  Viceroyalty  of  Peru,  arriving  at  Lima  in 
1581.  He  studied  Humanities  at  the  Colegio  Maximo  de  San 
Pablo  of  Lima,  becoming  Professor  of  the  Higher  Grammar 
Class.  In  1585  he  was  destined  to  the  village  Juli  for  the 
evangelization  of  the  Lupaqa  Indians,  by  which  he  was  forced 
to  learn  the  Aymara  language.  On  November  1,  1593  he 
celebrated  his  definitive  incorporation  to  the  Society  of  Jesus  in 


the  main  church  of  Juli  in  the  intermediate  grade  of  ’’teachers  of 
three  votes”.  He  lived  more  than  30  years  in  Chucuyto,  near 
Lake  Titicaca.  Between  1600  and  1602  he  was  Minister  of  the 
College  of  Potosi  being  ’’Indian  workers”,  allowing  him  to 
confront  the  Lupaqa  of  Aymara  with  other  variants  in  the 
different  regions  of  Qullasuyu457. 

This  Italian  let  us  know  the  following  (Bertonio  1612/1984): 


Alquerque  =  cumisina,  y  lo  mismo  significa  axedrez,  porque  los 
indios  no  distinguen  los  juegos,  sino  miran  al  modo. 

Alquerque  jugar;  o  al  axedrez;  cumisina.  por  ser  juego  semejante  al 
nuestro. 

Tablero  de  axedrez,  molinillo,  alquerque  etc.  Cumisina  tabla. 

Loose  translation: 

Alquerque  means  cumisina,  and  the  same  means  chess,  because  the 
Indians  do  not  distinguish  the  games,  but  the  way  they  look. 

Playing  alquerque;  or  chess;  cumisina,  because  it  is  similar  to  our 
game. 

Chess  boards,  marro,  alquerque  etc.  Cumisina,  tric-tac. 

Bertonio  probably  hispanicized  the  term  molinillo  in  his  mother 
tongue,  where  the  used  term  was  mulinello458.

9.5.25  1615  Felipe  Guaman  Poma  de  Ayala 

Felipe  Guaman  Poma  de  Ayala,  also  known  as  Guaman  Poma 
or  Huaman  Poma,  was  an  indigenous  Peruvian  who  became 
disillusioned  with  the  treatment  of  the  native  peoples  of  the 
Andes  by  the  Spanish  after  conquest.  Today  Guaman  Poma  is 
noted  for  his  illustrated  chronicle  Nueva  Cordnica  y  Buen 
Gobierno  {The  New  Chronicle  and  Good  Government),  a  1,189- 
page  document.  He  mistakenly  wrote  Cordnica  instead  of 
Cronica.  His  book  remains  the  longest  sustained  critique  of  the 
Spanish  colonial  rule  produced  by  an  indigenous  subject  in  the 
entire  colonial  period.  Written  between  1600  and  1615  and 
addressed  to  King  Philip  III  of  Spain  the  Cordnica  outlines  the 
injustices  of  colonial  rule  and  argues  that  the  Spanish  were 
foreign  settlers  in  Peru.  "It  is  our  country,"  he  said,  "because 
God  has  given  it  to  us”.  The  king  never  received  the  document. 
This  manuscript  includes  the  events  that  took  place  in  Peru 
between  Francisco  Pizarro  and  his  prisoner,  the  Inca 
Atagualpa459. 

(....)  De  como  estando  preso  conversava  Atagualpa  Ynga  con  don 
Francisco  Pizarro  y  don  Diego  de  Almagro  y  con  los  demas  espanoles 
y  jugava  con  ellos  en  el  juego  de  axedres  que  ellos  les  llaman  taptana. 
(Guaman  Poma  de  Ayala,  1615/1987). 

Loose  translation: 

Being  prisoner,  Atagualpa  talked  with  Don  Francisco  Pizarro  and  Don 
Diego  de  Almagro  and  with  the  other  Spanish  men.  He  also  played 
chess,  which  they  called  taptana. 

There  is  a  reference  here  to  the  alquerque  game,  which  due  to 
being  played  with  chess  pieces  was  mixed  up  with  chess  -  even 
in  the  name.  In  the  attached  drawing  it  can  be  seen  very  clearly

9.5.26  1617  Pietro  Carrera 


Pietro  Carrera  (1578-1647)  was  a  Sicilian  Archpriest,  theorist, 
and  chess  player.  In  1617  he  published  a  treatise  about  chess, 
which  was  an  excellent  source  for  knowing  more  about  chess 
and  the  players  in  his  time.  His  work  manages  in  an  exquisite 
way  some  of  the  probable  ancient  Roman  game  boards  and  its 
authors  ancient  and  current,  and  also  describes  some  games  that 
are  similar  to  the  checkers  game.  The  following  text  from  his 
book  refers  to  checker  and  similar  games460.

quelle  memorie  di  Scacchi,  che  si  ritrovano  in  Martiale,  in  Seneca,  et 
in  altri  s’intendono  per  gli  Scacchi  della  Riga,  e  non  per  gli  scacchi  del 
nostro  gioco  del  quale  ragioniamo,  iche  non  esser  vero  proveremo  co 
diverse,  e  fondate  ragioni,  et  anco  con  autorita  di  huomini  gravi 
scusisi  il  Calcagnino,  perche  gli  mancava  la  intiera  notitia  del  gioco, 
senza  laquale  non  potea  osservare,  et  essaminare  a  pieno  le  proprietati 
di  esso,  lequali  si  leggono  sparse  per  li  scrittori.  Prima  fia  necessario 
di  spiegare  la  cognitione  d e'giochi  della  Riga  affmche  il  tutto  rimanga 
dilucidato. 

La  Riga  appresso  gli  antichi  era  di  tre  maniere,  uno  come  afferma 
Celio  Rodigino  nel  lib.  20  nel  cap.  27  delle  antiche  lettioni  p  autorita 
di  Eustatio,  conteneva  sessante  Scacchi  parte  bianchi,  e  parte  neri,  et 
questa  era  chimata  Grammismus,  Digrammismus  e  Gramma,  che  son 
l’instesso,  che  linea,  ancorche  Gramma,  significasse  ogni  Riga;  cio 
conferma  Giulio  Polluce  nel  Dittionario  cosi  ragionado.  MSi  accosta  di 
presso  aqsto  gioco";  (Percioche  avanti  haveva  ragionato  di  gli 
Scacchi)  Il  Gramismo,  e’l  Digramissare,  ilqual  gioco  e  domandato  da 
alcuni  le  linee.  Questa  Riga  a  nostri  di  e  ignota,  et  estinta; 

Mi  maraviglio,  che  non  sia  stata  conosciuta  dal  Calcagnino,  ilquale 
ragione  diffusamente  della  seconda,  ch’e  quella,  laqual  si  giocava,  et 
hoggidi  ancora  si  gioca  co  dodici  pietre  bianche,  et  altretante  nere. 
Cicerone  in  Hortensio  "Itaque  tibi  concedo,  quod  in  duodecim  scrupis 
olim,  ut  calculum  reducas,  si  te  alicuius  dati  poeniteat."  Quintiliano 
nel  lib.  10  nel  cap.  2:  "An  vero  Scevola  in  lusu  duodecim  scruporum 
cu  prior  calculum  promovisset".  Si  divide  questa  Riga,  como  mostra 
la  seguete  figura  in  cinque  linee  ritagliate  perdritto,  et  altretante  per 
fianco  con  due  altre  linee,  che  la  fiedono  p  traverso  terminan  dosi 
negli  angoli,  si  veggono  in  essa  ancora  quatro  quadri  della  Riga,  e 
sciascuna  di  esse  abbraccia  tres  case,  ma  ciascuna  delle  linee 
maggiori  cosi  rette,  como  oblique  ne  ha  cinque,  et  in  queste  seggono 
le  pietre  del  gioco,  eccetto  la  linea  di  mezzo,  che  ha  quatro  luoghi 
ripieni  di  pietre,  perche  la  casa,  ch’e  nel  mezzo  di  essa,  riman  vota. 
Questa  linea  di  mezo  da  gli  anticha  era  detta  Sacra,  percioche  no  era 
lecito  senza  gran  necessita  di  movere  le  pietre  di  qualla,  onde  nacque 
il  Proverbio  "Movere  alique  a  Sacra",  il  quale  significa  constringere 
alcuno  adatto  di  estrema  necessita.  Theocrito  nel  6.  Idillio  "E  da  linea 
rimove  la  pietra".  Le  pietre,  le  quali  arrivano  all’ultima  linea  secondo 
Isidoro,  come  riferisce  Gioseppe  Scaligero  sopra  il  6.  lib.  Di  Varrone, 
si  chiamavano  Inciti

(Intomo  a  cio  mi  par  necessario  di  awertire,  che  questa  Riga  e 
diverso  di  quel  gioco,  che  i  Siciliani  chimano  Marrella,  e  gli 
Spagnuoli  el  juego  de  las  Damas,  benche  habbiano  alcune  cose 
comuni  ad  ambidue  i  giochi;  delquale  no  veggo,  che  ne  faccia 
mentione  scrittore  alcuno). 

Loose  translation: 

Another  opposition,  from  Celio  Calcagninus,  one  of  the  great  wise 
men  of  his  time,  in  his  treatise  says  that  chess  was  not  known  by  the 
ancients.  This  opinion  is  supported  by  the  great  genius  and  the 
argument  about  the  reference  to  chess  found  by  Martialis,  Seneca,  and 
others,  has  to  do  with  the  game  of  chess  over  a  Riga  board  and  not 
with  the  current  chess  game.  We  cannot  determine  with  conclusive 
proof  if  that  is  true,  nor  use  the  authority  of  a  serious  man  like 
Calcagninus,  because  he  lacks  knowledge  about  the  game  and  without 
it  the  observation  and  detailed  examination  of  the  game’s  features 
cannot  be  done.  We  found  little  about  it  in  this  writer’s  work.  Firstly, 
it  is  necessary  to  discover  what  is  known  about  the  Riga  game  and  in 
this  way  clarify  it  all. 


Alquerque  board  shown  by  Carrera 

The  Riga  game,  as  we  have  been  taught  by  the  ancient,  was  played  in 
3  ways:  The  first,  Celius  Rodiginus  confirms  in  the  20th  book, 
chapter  27  of  the  treatment  of  ancient  age,  quoting  the  authority  of 
Eustatius,  was  played  with  60  pieces,  one  part  white  and  another  part

black.  The  name  of  the  game  was  Grammismus,  Digrammismus,  and 
Gramma.  Gramma  always  means  Riga  (line).  This  is  also  confirmed 
by  Julius  Pollux  in  his  Onomasticon.  It  is  similar  to  this  game  (we 
already  have  figured  that  this  game  before  (Grammismus  and 
Diagrammismus  were  similar  stripped  games.  These  versions  of  Riga 
are  not  known  today,  they  are  extinguished. 

I  was  startled  about  the  fact  that  with  Calcagninus  we  don’t  know 
more  about  the  second  game,  which  he  barely  mentioned  and  which  is 
still  today  played  with  12  little  black  and  12  little  white  stones.  Cicero 
talks  about  it  in  Hortensio  Itaque  tibi  concedo,  quod  in  duodecim 
scrupis  olim,  ut  calculum  reducas,  si  te  alicuius  dati  poeniteat.  I 
allow  you,  as  we  usually  do  in  the  12  little  stone  games,  to  retire  the 
play  (piece)  if  you  regret  to  move  it.  Quintilian  in  the  10th  book, 
chapter  2:  An  Vero  Scevola  in  lusu  duodecim  scruporum  cii  prior 
calculum  promovisset.  (We  have  said  that  Scaevola,  in  which  the 
move  could  be  done  after  a  12  little  stones  game)  This  Riga  game,  it’s 
shown  in  the  next  drawing  divided  by  5  lines:  5  vertical,  5  horizontal 
,and  2  diagonal  lines  from  angle  to  angle.  This  way  4  frames  for  the 
mini  Riga  game  were  formed.  They  allow  about  three  little  stones  in 
the  lines.  But  in  each  one  of  the  big  straight  lines  and  the  diagonal 
lines  5  little  stones  are  allowed,  with  the  exception  of  the  middle  line 
where  4  little  stones  are  placed,  because  the  center  square  must  be 
empty.  This  middle  line  was  the  ’’Sacra  Line”  for  the  ancient  and  it 
was  not  allowed,  except  as  a  last  resource,  take  from  here  the  little 
stones.  So  the  proverb:  Movere  alique  a  Sacra  “Only  for  extreme 
necessity  this  action  must  be  done”  had  originated.  Theocritus  in  the 
Idylle  six:  To  change  the  piece  of  line.  The  piece  which  arrives  to  the 
last  line,  Isidorus  said,  quoted  by  Scaliger  in  his  Varro  work,  was 
named  ’’inciti”  (immobile). 

Considering  all  this  it  is  necessary  to  say  that  this  Riga  game  is 
different  from  the  game  which  the  Sicilians  call  Marrella  and  the 
Spanish  call  Checkers ,  despite  the  two  games  having  some  features  in 
common  and  of  it  I  didn’t  see  that  any  writer  were  quoted. 


-312- 


Brunet461  makes  the  following  observation:  If  the  game  that  the 
Sicilians  named  Marrella  coincides  with  our  Checkers  game, 
the  Sicilian  name  could  demonstrate  that  this  is  derived  from 
the  predecessor  of  the  Riga  12,  equal  to  our  Marro.  This  word 
actually  could  be  a  diminutive  of  the  Sicilian  Marrella.

This  Austrian  Jesuit  and  philosopher  was  bom  in  1561  in 
Innichen  (Tirol)  and  died  in  1634  in  Munich.  His  more  famous 
work  is  the  noted  edition  of  The  Epigrams  of  Martialis  (1599 
and  followers).  Raderus  mentions  Calcagninus: 

Mandris:  regionibus,  seu  urbibus  expono  cum  Calagnino  lib.  de  ludo 
talorum,  tesserarum,  et  calculorum  alio  qui  bis  idem  diceret,  si

hanc  vocem  usurpavit,  ubi  mandram  claustrum,  seu  septum  ovium,

metaphora,  ut  calculorum,  seu  latronum  sedes  (Graeci  nominant 
mandras)  hie  appellant  quas  regiones  Pollux  et  Eustathius  vocant  et 
urbes.

hae  regiones  plerumque  quinque,  lineolis,  tranversariisque,  et 
decussationibus  altematim  dimensae,  quinque,  et  viginti  numero, 
singulis  latrones  quinque  insistebant,  praeter  mediam,  qui  tantum 
quatuor  tribuebantur.

Loose  translation: 

Mandra  (Martialis  Book  5,  epigram  27):  I  agree  with  Calcagninus 
when  he  says  in  his  book  about  the  board  games  and  dice  that  that 
word  is  used  twice  in  the  thieves’  game,  otherwise  meaning  a  fenced 
territory  (block)  for  sheep,  bovine,  and  donkeys.  I  think  that  the 
metaphorical  meaning  of  the  word  is  ‘places  where  the  game  pieces 
or  thieves  are  settled’  (mandris  in  Greek)  which  Pollux  names  as 
regions  and  Eustathius  as  metropolis  (cities).  Latro:  mercenary 
soldier,  thief.  The  pieces  (calculi)  are  traitors  and  thieves.  In  Latin 
they  were  called  canes  (dogs).  They  are  in  what  the  Romans  call 
abacus  and  we  a  game  board,  which  is  divided  by  lines  in  squares: 
the  proverb  says  about  the  cities  that  with  small  feats  the  great  men 
become  weak  and  the  pantries  are  provided.  The  places  to  play 
(intersection  points)  were  made  by  drawing  5  horizontal  and  vertical 
lines  which  resulted  in  25  intersection  points.  It  was  the  reason  why  5 
thieves  always  met  in  a  line,  with  the  exception  of  the  middle  line 
where  only  4  thieves  were  allowed. 

Justifying  either  part,  thieves  or  dogs,  distinguished  by  color,  it  must 
be  said  that  treason  and  passion  were  born  from  the  spirit  of  this 
game.  If  one  went  towards  an  enemy  without  a  companion,  he  was 
encircled  and  taken  as  prisoner  on  the  battlefield.  Sophocles  says  that 
soldiers  usually  march  five  in  a  line.  About  what  was  mentioned  in 
reference  to  the  middle  line,  which  was  called  sacara,  a  piece  from 
there  could  only  be  taken  as  a  last  resort.  This  way  the  proverb  ‘call 
additional  protection’  was  born.  Calcagninus  quotes  Martialis  (Book 


-314- 


14,  epigram  17):  A  piece  between  two  pieces  of  another  color  is 
considered  lost.  And  in  Epigram  20:  If  you  play  the  thieves’  game, 
glass  pieces  will  be  your  soldiers  and  your  enemies.  In  the  group  of 
pieces  there  are  only  five  lines  and  16  sections  or  squares.  However, 
in  the  game  of  chess  there  are  nine  lines  and  64  sections. 


9.5.28  1645  Hugo  Grotius 

In  1603,  20  years  old  Hugo  Grotius  wrote  9  epigrams  in  Latin 
about  the  games463.  He  wrote  the  following  about  checkers  or 
the  alquerque  game: 

Ludus  duodenorum  scruporum.  Jeu  de  dames.  -  alquerque? 

Scrupea  bella  vides,  Danaumque  &  Memnonis  arma:  Vicisse  est, 
hostes  transiliisse  suos464.

enemies.

In  the  board  game  there  are  regions  divided  by  lines  which  are 
reserved  for  the  cities  which  give  origin  to  the  proverb:  with  small 
feats  the  great  men  become  weak  and  the  pantries  are  provided.  These 
regions  are  formed  by  5  horizontal  and  vertical  lines  which  alternate 
with  lines  drawn  in  crosses  and  count  25  in  total.  In  the  first  line  there 
were  thieves,  but  in  the  middle  line  only  4  obtained  a  place.  Freigius

9.5.30  1695  Thomas  Hyde 

Thomas  Hyde  (1636-1703)  was  an  English  orientalist  and 
Hebrew  professor  at  Queen's  College  Oxford  in  1658.  He 
studied  Arabic,  Persian,  Syriac,  and  Chinese.  He  wrote  several 
books.  In  the  first  of  2  volumes  of  one  of  his  works  in  Latin, 
Ludis  Orientalibus,  he  researches  the  origin  of  chess.  Hyde 
concluded  that  the  game  was  invented  in  India466.  In  his  book 
Hyde  describes  the  checkers  game  too.  He  takes  much 
information  from  Covarrubias,  whom  we  have  quoted  before. 
Hyde467  thought  that  the  word  dame  was  derived  from  the 
German  word  dam,  but  he  could  not  support  his  statement  with 
any  proof. 

Thomas  Hyde 

Hispani  quatuor  hujus  Ludi  Nomina  habent:  quorum  unum  est  Las

In  this  edition  of  his  book  a  description  -  sometimes  in  a 
drawing  -  of  the  alquerque  board  can  be  found.  There  are 
several  notes  from  Calcagninus,  Freigius,  Erasmus,  Raderus 
(Rader),  and  Senftlebius.  They  indicate  the  Soldiers’  Game, 


-318- 


Cities’  Game  (polis),  and  Game  of  Pieces  as  the  names  of  the 
game.  They  think  that  alquerque  is  similar  to  the  games  that  the 
Romans  and  Greeks  played  in  ancient  times.  Unfortunately  they 
actually  did  not  mention  the  rules  of  the  game.  Calcagninus’s 
description  is  undoubtedly  the  most  interesting  of  all468. 


9.5.32  1734  Francesco  de  Ficoroni 

Many  years  later,  in  1734,  the  Italian  Francesco  de  Ficoroni 
(1664-1747)  gives  us  more  information  about  Caelius 
Calcagninus  and  his  Alquerque- 12  game.  Ficoroni,  bom  in 
1664  at  Lugano  and  deceased  in  1747,  was  an  Italian 
connoisseur  and  antiquarian  in  Rome  closely  involved  with  the 
antiquities  trade.  He  was  the  author  of  numerous  publications  on 
ancient  Roman  sculpture  and  antiquities,  guides  to  the 
monuments  of  Rome  and  the  city's  ancient  topography,  and  on 
Italian  theatre  and  theatrical  masks  among  other  subjects.  For 
his  antiquarian  works  he  was  made  a  Fellow  of  the  Royal 
Society  of  London.  The  following  text  is  an  abbreviated  Italian 
translation  of  the  Calcagninus  text  (before  1541)  and  an

uscisse  dalla  linea,  che  dicevasi  sacra,  de  era  quella  di  mezzo,  a  cui 
presedevano  y  due  Caporali.  Con  cio  viene  egli  ad  avere  ciascheduno

Loose  translation: 

Celio  Calcagninus  didn’t  agree  with  the  given  opinions,  which  are 
precise  in  the  description,  and  although  they  are  good,  I  think  that 
they  do  not  clearly  reflect  how  the  game  was  played.  12  pieces  were 
settled  on  each  side  of  the  board;  two  tens  and  four  corporals,  2  from 
each  side  because  according  to  Vegezio  the  manipolo  was  formed  by 
ten  of  the  same  soldiers  (in  a  tent).  That  is  why  those  pieces  are  called 
manipel  soldiers.  Every  ten  are  divided  into  two  groups  and  5  soldiers 
are  placed  in  2  rows  and  in  the  middle  line  2  corporals  are  settled  to 
protect  their  little  company.  At  the  moment  when  one  soldier  leaves 
his  place  his  enemy  captures  and  kills  him.  And  such  thing  is  not  easy 
to  accomplish  if  the  crew  flanks  are  open.  That  is  why  there  was  a  law 
which  said  that  no  one  could  allow  this  line  (which  the  two  corporals 
protected)  vulnerable.  This  way  an  army  of  3  rows  is  obtained,  as  in 
the  Roman  Army  which  intimately  recognized  itself,  like  in  a 
painting.

After  having  studied  the  alquerque  descriptions  in  the  various 
texts  of  the  books  and  dictionaries  it  appeared  that  at  the 
beginning  of  the  16th  century  alquerque  12  was  probably  played 
in  Italy  with  10  pieces  and  2  corporals  at  the  beginning  of  the 
game.  It  is  not  clear  if  there  was  promotion  in  this  game. 

The  draughts,  which  was  a  new  game  around  1500,  might  have 
been  played  in  two  ways: 

On  the  chessboard  with  12  pawns 


-  330  - 


Probably  on  a  line  board  with  12  pawns 
On  both  boards  the  new  Dama  piece  was  used 
On  both  boards  the  promotion  was  new 

Francesch  Vicent  learned  from  Celio  Calcagnini  and  he  took 
over  in  draughts  in  the  beginning  position  the  two  corporals 
from  alquerque  in  the  form  of  two  damas.  Apart  from  using  the 
two  damas  in  the  beginning  draughts  had  promotion.  These 
events  are  described  in  the  book  of  Juan  de  Timoneda  that 
appears  to  have  been  published  in  1547,  although  the  texts 
appear  to  have  been  from  the  beginning  of  the  1 5th  century.

9.7  Different  versions  of  Alquerque 


9.7.1  Terhiichii  -  9  pieces 

And  so  we  finally  come  to  the  expanded  alquerque  12  game  with  8 
triangles  that  is  known  under  the  name  of  Terhiichii.  It  is  a  game  from 
India,  and  specifically  from  Assam  and  Angami  Nagas508. 


Terhiichii 


In  most  of  these  alquerque  varieties  the  Dama  with  her  long  leap  was 
not  used  and  in  all  these  games  there  was  no  promotion. 

However,  things  slowly  changed  in  the  16th  century  when  the 
powerful  Dama  was  introduced  in  draughts  and  chess.  Then  we  see 
the  powerful  Dama  capturing  many  pieces  with  her  long  leap 
suddenly  appear  on  the  alquerque  board  and  the  games  in  the  Sahara

example  of  this  new  variety.

9.7.2  Erseser  -  12  pieces 


Erseser 

This  alquerque  game  was  described  by  Neuman509and  Joustra510 
who  knew  4  variations.  Each  player  had  12  pieces,  as  reflected 
in  the  drawing.  The  original  way  is  to  capture  each  other,  but 
the  writer  does  not  say  whether  the  pieces  can  be  moved 
backward,  so  this  is  something  we  have  to  admit.  One  capture 
till  the  enemy  has  no  more  pieces  or  has  blocked  them  all.  If  a 
piece  is  placed  on  an  intersection  point  a,  then  the  enemy  pieces 
that  are  on  the  edge  at  the  ends  of  the  line  have  been  blocked 
and  can  be  captured.  It  is  played  in  Central  Sumatra.  (Jansen, 
1992:40-41)

again  according  to  Maasz  in  Central  Sumatra  under  the  name 
Thatoer.  Hasselt513  uses  the  term  Tjatoewe.  Veth514  speaks  of 
Tjatuwe.  This  type  of  game  of  checkers  is  still  practiced  today 
in  Indonesia515.  This  game  can  be  found  in  Malaysia516. 
Cense517  uses  the  term  game  of  checkers  for  a  game  with  16 
pieces. 

The  Bataks  also  practice  a  game  in  which  16  pieces  are  used 
and  where  the  center  square  is  not  empty  at  the  beginning,  but 
all  parts  of  the  middle  line.  Dr.  Winkler  says  that  this  game 
is  called  Tampul  and  that  the  board  is  recognized  as  a  Usir 
board.  Klinkert519  mentions  a  game  with  16  red  pieces  and  16 
white  pieces  called  tabal.  This  game  can  be  found  under  other 

520 

names  in  Sri  Lanka  and  Pakistan,  as  we  can  see  in  Botermans 
book.

9.7.4  Soldiers  game  -  16  pieces 


Soldiers  game 


This  game  is  practiced  in  Ceylon  and  India,  in  which  each 
player  has  16  pieces.  A  variant  of  this  game  is  one  with  23 
pieces;  Bell  (1979)  used  to  say  that  for  this  a  triangle  was 
placed  to  the  left  and  right.  Worth  mentioning  is  the  fact  that  the 
game  of  alquerque  is  known  in  India  under  the  name  of 
"draughts522".

9.7.5  Mughal  Pathan  -  16  pieces 

And  so  we  automatically  come  to  a  similar  alquerque  board 
with  two  triangles  called  Mughal  Pathan,  or  Cows  and 
Leopards.  Either  player  has  sixteen  pieces  placed  on  the 
crosspoints  of  the  lines524,  one  player  on  the  left  of  the  board 
and  the  other  on  the  right.  Players  move  alternatively  and  can 
move  in  any  direction  along  a  line  to  an  adjacent  point.  A 
capture  is  made  by  jumping  over  an  enemy  piece  to  a  vacant 
point  beyond  -  several  pieces  can  be  captured  in  one  move  by  a 
series  of  leaps  over  single  enemy  pieces.  A  player  loses  when 
all  their  pieces  have  been  captured.  As  an  additional  rule  it  is 
suggested  that  if  a  player  fails  to  make  a  capture,  the  piece  is 
"huffed"  and  removed  from  the  board.  A  variant  gives  each 
player  seven  extra  pieces  placed  on  the  points  of  the  triangle  to 
the  player's  left525.

9.7.7  Tukunanawopi  -  20  pieces 

Culin  describes  this  type  of  alquerque  usually  played  by  2  or 
4  people.  Each  player  has  20  pieces  (animals)  and  can  play  or 
capture  in  any  direction. 


Tukunanawopi 


Removing  an  enemy  piece  is  performed  by  capturing  into  an 
empty  box  just  behind  the  enemy  piece.  As  soon  as  a  row  of 
points  of  intersections  is  free  of  pieces,  it  is  no  longer  used,  so 
at  the  end  of  the  game  it  takes  place  in  very  few  points  of 
intersections.  Those  no  longer  participating  in  the  game  are 
called  houses  and  the  pieces  (animals)  are  placed  over  them.

OA 

According  to  Botermans  (this  version  is  also  called  Zamma 
in  the  Sahara. 

Everything  here  also  indicates  that  the  word  houses  derives 
from  the  Spanish  word  casas. 


Tuknanavuhpi  in  the  Canary  Islands 

Consequently  the  sixteenth  century  was  the  century  of  the 
change  of  the  alquerque  12  game  to  draughts  on  the  chessboard, 
but  this  change  was  gradual.  Not  everybody  immediately 
accepted  this  draughts  game.  Instead  of  playing  draughts  the 
Hopi  Indians  (Oraibi,  Arizona)  played  a  type  of  alquerque 
called  Tuknanavuhpi  on  the  same  board  as  the  alquerque  12 
board  of  4  horizontal  and  4  vertical  lines,  but  now  using  the 
diagonal  lines531  much  more  as  in  the  draughts  board  (Spanish 
chess  board). 

On  this  board  each  player  has  20  pieces  and  the  game  is  the 
same  as  alquerque- 12,  thus  with  the  central  point  free.  This 
board  is  only  found  in  Tenerife  (Canary  Islands)  and  not  on  the 
other  islands  .  It  also  appears  to  be  a  game  in  Mauritania  .

Fanorona  (Malagasy  chess) 


According  to  Bell534  this  game  was  invented  in  1680  in 
Madagascar  by  taking  a  double  alquerque  board.  This  game  was 
described  by  Montgomery  ,  Chauvicourt  ,  Thanassecos  , 
and  Fox538.

Association). 


-342- 


Fanorona  is  derived  from  the  ancient  alquerque  12  game  and  the 
rules  of  this  game  are  as  follows: 

Players  take  alternate  turns,  starting  with  the  white.  We 
distinguish  two  kinds  of  moves,  noncapturing  and  capturing.  A 
noncapturing  move  is  called  paika.  A  paika  move  consists  of 
moving  one  stone  along  a  line  to  an  adjacent  intersection. 
Capturing  moves  are  obligatory  and  have  to  be  played  in 
preference  to  paika  moves.  Capturing  implies  removing  one  or 
more  pieces  of  the  opponent.  It  can  be  done  in  two  ways,  by 
approach  or  by  withdrawal.  An  approach  is  moving  the 
capturing  stone  to  a  point  adjacent  to  an  opponent  stone 
provided  that  the  stone  is  on  the  continuation  of  the  capturing 
stone's  movement  line.  A  withdrawal  works  analogously  to  an 
approach,  except  that  the  movement  is  away  from  the  opponent 
stone.  When  an  opponent  stone  is  captured,  all  opponent  pieces 
in  line  behind  that  stone  (as  long  as  there  is  no  interruption  by 
an  empty  point  or  an  own  stone)  are  captured  as  well.  If  a  player 
can  do  an  approach  and  a  withdrawal  at  the  same  time,  he  has  to 
choose  which  one  he  plays. 

As  in  draughts,  the  capturing  piece  is  allowed  to  continue 
making  successive  captures  with  these  restrictions: 

The  piece  is  not  allowed  to  arrive  at  the  same  position  twice.  It 
is  not  allowed  to  move  a  piece  in  the  same  direction  as  directly 
before  in  the  capturing  sequence.  This  can  happen  if  an 
approach  follows  a  withdrawal.  The  game  ends  when  one  player 
captures  all  the  stones  of  the  opponent.  If  neither  player  can 
achieve  this,  the  game  is  a  draw.

9.7.9  Perali  Kotuma  -  23  pieces 


There  exists  another  expanded  alquerque  board  with  4  triangles 
and  its  name  is  Perali  Kotuma539.  This  game  was  also  played  in 
India  according  to  Parker540  and  each  player  has  twenty-three 
men. 


Perali  Kotuma 


Each  player’s  pieces  are  initially  set  up  on  the  first  four  ranks  of 
their  side  of  the  board,  and  on  the  triangle  patterned  board  to  the 
right  of  the  player.  A  piece  moves  one  space  per  turn  in  any 
direction  following  the  pattern  on  the  board  onto  an  unoccupied 
point  on  the  board.  A  piece  can  capture  an  enemy  piece  in  any 
direction  by  the  short  leap  as  in  draughts  or  alquerque.  The 
player's  piece  must  be  adjacent  to  the  enemy  piece,  and  leap 
over  it  to  a  vacant  point  on  the  other  side.  The  leap  must  be  in  a 
straight  line  following  the  pattern  on  the  board.  The  same  piece 
can  continue  to  capture  and  even  change  direction  to  capture

provided  that  the  capturing  requirements  are  satisfied.  Captures 
are  compulsory.  A  piece  must  continue  to  capture  if  it  is  able  to 
do  so.  Captured  pieces  are  removed  from  the  board.  If  a  player 
has  more  than  one  option  to  capture,  the  player  can  choose  one 
of  them.

9.7.10  Kotu  Ellima  -  24  pieces 


There  also  exist  expanded  alquerque  12  boards  with  4  triangles. 
In  Ceylon  there  is  a  game  called  Kotu  Ellima541  and  Parker 
described  this  game  too542,  in  which  each  player  has  twenty- four 
men.  Sri  Lanka  is  the  current  name  of  Ceylon. 


Kotu  Ellima 

Each  player's  pieces  are  initially  set  up  on  their  half  of  the 
board,  and  the  triangle  board  to  each  player's  right.  Each  player 
places  one  piece  on  the  intersection  point  to  the  right  of  the 
middle  point  from  the  view  of  each  player.  Only  the  middle 
point  is  left  vacant  at  the  beginning  of  the  game.  A  piece  moves 
one  space  per  turn  in  any  direction  following  the  pattern  on  the 
board  onto  an  unoccupied  point  on  the  board.  A  piece  can 
capture  an  enemy  piece  in  any  direction  by  the  short  leap  as  in 
draughts  or  alquerque.  The  player's  piece  must  be  adjacent  to 
the  enemy  piece,  and  leap  over  it  onto  a  vacant  point  on  the 
other  side.  The  leap  must  be  in  a  straight  line  following  the

pattern  on  the  board.  The  same  piece  can  continue  to  capture 
and  even  change  direction  to  capture  provided  that  the  capturing 
requirements  are  satisfied.  Captures  are  compulsory.  A  piece 
must  continue  to  capture  if  it  is  able  to  do  so.  Captured  pieces 
are  removed  from  the  board.  If  a  player  has  more  than  one 
option  to  capture,  the  player  can  choose  any  (and  only)  one  of 
them.

9.7.11  Meurimueng  -  40  pieces 


Meurimueng  -  Rimueng  Penet  Ploh  -  40  pieces 

Raffles543,  Eggink544,  and  Snouck545  mention  this  game  called 
Tiger  game,  in  which  each  player  has  40  pieces.  You  can  move 
in  any  direction  and  capture,  but  capturing  is  not  mandatory. 
According  to  Mayer546  and  Coolsma547  in  Java  this  game  is 
called  dam-adman  originating  from  the  Dutch  word  dam 
Beart  tells  us  that  in  the  Sahara  this  game  was  practiced  on 
top  of  81  points  of  intersection  under  the  name  les  batonnets. 
Pieces  can  only  move  forward,  but  capturing  is  both  forward 
and  backward. 


9.7.11.1  Damma 

Murray549  reflects  this  game  in  his  book  under  the  name

found  in  Fuenteventura  (Canary  Islands),  but  not  on  the  other 
islands  or  in  Spain.  Probably  the  Arabs  developed  this  new

9.7.12  Satoel  -  46  pieces 


Satoel 

A  game  of  Malay  origin,  as  reported  by  Jacobson554,  in  which 
each  player  has  46  pieces.  Now  you  should  try,  turn  by  turn,  to 
capture  the  maximum  amount  of  enemy  pieces.  An  enemy  piece 
is  captured  by  jumping  over  it  if  the  intersection  point  behind 
the  enemy  piece  is  unoccupied.  You  can  also  capture  more 
pieces  at  once,  provided  that  there  are  empty  points  of 
intersection  between  the  pieces.  You  can  capture  in  any 
direction  -  forward,  backward,  orthogonally,  and  vertically. 
Pieces  also  move  in  any  direction  from  one  intersection  point  to 
another.  The  one  who  loses  all  his  pieces  loses  the  game555.

tables,  chess  and  alquerque,  consisting  of  100  squares.  At  the 
edges  of  the  board  there  are  some  obscured  triangles.  If  pieces 
are  not  placed  there,  the  available  number  of  points  of 
intersection  is  2x54  with  1  empty  point  in  the  center.  This 
amount  corresponds  to  the  candidate  game  of  Penelope  (With 
Athenaeus).  The  game  board  is  from  the  early  seventeenth 
century  and  probably  originated  in  southern  Germany556

108  Crown  candidates? 


Caro557  described  the  game  of  108  candidates  of  Penelope.  This 
game  was  named  in  Homerus,  Athenaeus  (c.  200  AD)  and 
mentioned  by  all  humanists  who  wrote  about  the  classic  games. 
Rob  Jansen  notes  that  on  the  Rijksmuseum  board  only  108 
pieces  (2x54)  can  be  placed,  leaving  an  empty  central  place  for 
Penelope.

9.7.14  Diagrammismos  (grammai)  -  60  pieces 

Several  Roman  authors  have  mentioned  this  game,  but  we  know 
nothing  certain  about  the  board  or  how  it  was  played.  It  was 
played  on  lines  and  each  player  had  60  pieces559.  There  is  a 
game  called  Chuki.  Other  authors560  use  the  term  Tjoeki.  For  a 
further  description  of  the  various  games  similar  to  alquerque  we 
recommend  consulting  Murray’s  (1952)  work.

Finally  we  note  that  according  to  Winter561  it  was  played  on  a 
board  of  144  squares.  There  was  a  game  called  metjoeki  and  it 
was  a  kind  of  game  of  checkers562.  Matthes563  also  mentions  a 
game  of  checkers  adangang.  Murray564  confirms  that  the  Dutch 
brought  the  game  to  East  India  in  the  seventeenth  century. 
Probably  the  Spanish  or  Portuguese  introduced  the  small 
checkerboard  of  64  squares  in  the  seventeenth  century,  which 
was  later  replaced  by  the  Dutch  with  the  large  board  of  100 
squares.

9.8  Conclusion 


As  in  the  game  of  marro,  historians  use  the  term  juego  de  fichas 
(Schijvenspel  in  Dutch)  for  alquerque-12,  but  it  was  played  in 
Spain  in  the  period  between  1283  -  c.  1700  with  some  kind  of 
pawn  and  that's  why  I  like  the  term  juego  de  piezas 
(Stukkenspel  in  Dutch)  better. 

Probably  the  board  of  Alquerque-12  -  think  on  a  board  without 
pieces  -  was  already  known  in  the  Roman  times  for  different 
games.  As  several  authors  from  the  sixteenth  century  always 
refer  to  the  Roman  times,  it  cannot  be  anything  other  than  that 
the  game  of  checkers  went  through  gradual  stages  of 
developments.  I  do  not  think  that  alquerque  of  12,  as  described 
by  King  Alfonso  X  the  Wise,  had  already  had  the  "crowning"  of 
the  lady  (queen)  in  the  thirteenth  or  fourteenth  centuries.  Van 
der  Stoep  thinks  about  this  possibility,  but  evidence  is  needed 
for  such  claim.  In  other  words,  in  my  opinion  the  game  of 
alquerque-12  has  never  been  a  game  of  checkers,  even  if  this 
game  had  the  "crowning".  The  difference  between  the  two 
games  is  too  big.  Therefore,  there  must  have  been  a  transitional 
game.  This  game  could  be  andarraya,  discovered  by  Rob 
Jansen,  which  was  probably  a  game  of  checkers.  This  is  because 
a  piece  that  had  reached  the  8th  row  could  return  either  in  the 
form  of  a  piece  or  in  the  form  of  a  short  or  weak  lady  (dame).  I 
need  more  proof  here  for  the  weak  dame.  But  here  I  see  two 
possibilities.  The  piece,  once  arrived  in  the  8th  row,  could  go 
back  in  two  diagonal  directions  and  then  not  have  the  status  of  a 
lady  (dame).  If,  however,  the  piece,  once  crowned,  could  go 
back  and  then  forward  again,  i.e.  in  4  diagonal  directions,  then 
such  piece  had  to  be  marked.  In  this  case  the  piece  was 
therefore  a  short  or  weak  lady  (dame). 


-  356  - 


This  game  called  andarraya  is  no  longer  seen  in  the  sixteenth 
century.  The  game  keeps  being  played  under  the  name  of 
alquerque,  while  the  game  of  alquerque  of  12,  as  mentioned  in 
the  book  of  King  Alfonso  X  the  Wise,  slowly  died  now  that  the 
game  of  checkers  became  very  popular  on  the  chessboard  and 
stripes.  I  see  this  new  game  of  alquerque,  i.e.  the  previous  game 
of  andarraya  (eventually  the  striped  system  of  andarraya  on  a 
chessboard)  as  a  game  of  checkers. 

All  historians  with  all  their  hypotheses  always  mention  the 
chessboard,  but  for  the  game  of  checkers  it  is  not  absolutely 
necessary  -  if  we  think  about  the  game  of  andarraya  such  as 
played  on  32  holes  or  on  intersections  (Philippine’s  game). 

The  fact  that  dictionaries  sometimes  mention  alquerque  as  a 
chess  game  is  because  it  was  played  in  Spain  until  1700  with 
some  kind  of  chess  pawns  on  the  alquerque  and  chess  boards.

10  ALQUERQUE-12  AND  ITS 
FORERUNNERS 

(Jose  Antonio  Garzon  Roger565) 


King  Alfonso  X  the  Wise  stated  in  1283  that  the  alquerque 
12  game  had  borrowed  something  of  chess,  backgammon, 
and  dice. 

10.1  From  Chess 

1. -  It  is  played  with  the  head,  applying  intelligent  reasoning 

(thinking) 

2. -  The  pieces  are  like  chess  pawns

10.2  From  backgammon 

1.  The  possibility  that  the  game  can  end  in  a  draw. 

2.  The  signs  carried  out  on  the  board  where  you  put  the  pieces 
together.  Reading  the  chapter  on  tables  there  is  no  doubt  about 
that.  The  possibility  that  these  signs  were  carried  out  on  the 
pawns  for  marking  a  coronation  (for  example)  do  not  exist.  In 
backgammon  the  signs  are  used  to  indicate  placement  of  the 
discs.  The  thick  lines  of  alquerque  12  mark  the  routes  or 
movements  of  the  pieces  and  their  intersections,  as  said  Alfonso 
X,  indicating  the  location  of  the  pawns  that  have  to  be  located 
all  in  az  [again  here]  (all  together  forming  a  bunch). 

10.3  From  the  dice 

The  dice  determines  who  begins  the  game,  because  as  the  wise 
King  says,  who  starts  the  game  has  a  worse  game. 


Important:  Due  to  the  confusion  that  still  exists,  the  seriousness 
that  requires  this  matter,  and  the  frivolity  with  which  many 
players  and  historians  have  come  to  its  rules,  on  August  2  2003 
in  Chelva,  Garzon  practiced  alquerque  with  a  good  childhood 
friend  and  an  excellent  chess  player,  Jose  Martinez  Llopart. 
The  game  that  had  been  played  in  those  days  removed  any 
doubts  about  the  game.  Garzon,  with  the  alquerque  board  as 
testing  bench,  could  set  the  following: 

10.4  Synopsis  of  the  development  of  the  game: 

The  pieces  move  one  step  in  any  direction.  The  idea  of  any 
direction,  even  backwards,  is  confirmed  in  the  text  of  the  wise 
King  Alfonso  X.  The  lines  indicate  a  straight  direction.  The 
traces  of  these  lines  are  well  marked  confirming  the  path  of  the 
pawns. 


-  359  - 


The  possibility  of  a  coronation  has  not  been  observed  anywhere. 
This  must  be  ruled  out  completely,  as  something  like  that  and 
also  the  nature  of  the  new  piece  ought  to  have  been  stated  by  the 
wise  King  Alfonso  X.  As  in  all  games  the  wise  King  Alfonso  X 
gives  us  sufficient  rules  of  the  games  to  practice  them. 
Therefore  he  does  not  indicate  what  happens  when  the  pawn 
reaches  the  end  of  the  board.  This  is  already  implied  in  its 
motion:  simply  turning  back.  There  is  no  need  to  mark  the 
pawns  that  reach  the  end  of  the  board.  This  was  confirmed 
during  the  game  between  Jose  Antonio  Garzon  Roger  and 
Jose  Martinez  Llopart.  Other  possible  approaches  became 
very  dark  and  stale  to  the  game. 

The  number  of  possible  captures  is  multiple,  and  there  is  not 
established  limit.  The  capture  step  only  requires  that  there  is  an 
empty  square  (as  in  draughts)  behind  the  pawn  taken.  The 
capture  can  be  simultaneously  forward,  sideward,  and 
backward.  This  implies  that  in  the  live  game  one  can  capture 
even  3  or  4  pieces  at  once,  in  one  move.

Capturing  is  mandatory,  but  not  absolutely  obbgatory.

the  pawn  and  make  a  move.  Analyzing  this  game  it  is  perceived 
that  the  huff  (blowing)  here  makes  more  sense  than  in  draughts. 
Interestingly  one  should  analyze  why  in  the  draughts  game 
players  often  evoked  the  practice  of  blowing,  which  is  not  part 
of  its  original  rules.  This  may  be  evidence  of  a  trace  of  its 
connection  with  alquerque  12.

The  limits  of  a  5x5  checkered  board  by  moving  alquerque  12  to 
it  allow  victory  in  many  cases,  as  Garzon  found  out  with  his 
friend  Martinez  Llopart.  Therefore  the  wise  King  Alfonso  X 
says  that  he  who  does  not  care  for  his  pieces  is  defeated.  The 

small  material  advantage  of  a  pawn  can  provide  victory568. 


567  In  making  this  transfer  Garzon  had  a  wonderful  feeling,  perhaps  similar 
to  what  the  pioneer  teachers  must  have  had,  who  made  the  same  test  many 
centuries  ago.  Since  in  alquerque  developed  on  the  lines  the  movement  is 
limited  only  to  the  strokes  of  those  same  lines  and  there  exist  places  where 
there  is  no  diagonal  movement  (no  lines  on  the  alquerque  board),  apparently 
this  would  mean  that  there  might  be  some  confusion  on  the  bicoloured  board. 
But  the  magic  lines  of  alquerque,  its  quadrature,  course,  and  cross, 
highlight  the  miracles  of  clarity,  ounce  transferred  to  the  chessboard,  as 
if  it  were  a  magical  or  divine  play!  On  a  5x5  chessboard  the  movement  of 
the  pieces  will  just  be  determined  by  the  colour  of  the  squares:  if  the  right 
square  is  black  and  the  pieces  are  occupying  a  black  square,  then  such  pieces 
have  the  complete  alquerque  movement  (forward,  diagonal,  sideward,  and 
backward),  however  if  the  pieces  are  occupying  a  white  square,  then  the 
pieces  will  lose  the  diagonal  movement.  With  this  simple  rule  alquerque  can 
be  practiced  on  a  chessboard.  Surprising  fact,  and  it  also  introduces  new 
confirmatory  elements,  as  discussed  below,  the  evolutionary  connection: 
alquerque-andarraya-draughts.  On  the  chessboard  alquerque  takes  a  new 
complexion  that  was  not  appreciated  in  its  lined  representation:  funny  game 
where  the  power  of  the  pieces  depends  on  the  colour  of  the  square.  In  order 
to  exhaust  the  endgame  positions  we  have  found  a  saving  position  for  the 
weak  side  (endgame  4).)  By  transferring  the  game  from  the  lined  board  of 
5x5  to  the  chessboard  the  game  lends  itself  to  systematization  and  wins  in 
analytical  rigour. 

568  But  there  was  still  a  problem  of  the  lack  of  diagonal  movement  on  12 
squares  of  the  board  (all  of  the  same  colour)  and  most  likely  tests  were  done 
to  extend  the  diagonal  movement  to  all  the  squares  of  the  board.  Then  the 
exact  movements  no  longer  depended  on  the  colour  of  the  squares,  and  so  it 
was  a  genuine  attribute  of  all  pieces.  The  basic  endgame  of  2  to  1  is  now  an 
absolute  win  and  it  is  enough  to  place  a  piece  on  the  center  square  c3  (the 
holy  or  sacred  line  to  the  Romans,  the  main  diagonal  of  the  draughts  game, 
and  even  existing  in  alquerque  3  or  noughts  and  crosses).  At  some  point  the 
game  switched  to  the  8x8  board,  playing  on  the  coloured  squares  with  the 
exclusive  diagonal  move  of  the  alquerque  (also  backward  and  therefore  no 
coronation).  The  endgame  of  2  to  1  now  inevitably  and  easily  wins,  which 


-  362  - 


The  matched  finals  (2  pawns  against  two  or  3  against  3  are 
usually  ending  in  a  draw  (so  says  the  wise  king:  If  both  players 
know  how  to  play,  there  is  often  a  draw.  We  saw  that  it  was 
necessary  to  practice  to  form  an  opinion  on  adequate.  Alquerque 
12  is  a  subtle  and  witty  game  that  could  be  systematized  (to  a 
lesser  extent  than  draughts). 


Endgame  1 


Endgame  3 


The  Endgames  1  to  3 

In  all  these  positions  (2  against  1)  of  the  endgames  1  to  3  the 
weaker  side  must  move  and  cannot  avoid  the  immediate  loss. 
Worthwhile  is  the  endgame  1,  where  one  can  extract  the  idea  of 
the  strokes  and  lines  of  alquerque:  victory  is  achieved  by  the 
absence  of  the  diagonal  movement  in  the  while  squares.  The 
alignment  of  three  in  a  row  is  surprising. 

The  Endgame  4 

An  important  position  of  2  against  1  is  that  of  the  endgame  4, 
because  this  endgame  can  always  force  cases.  However, 


-364- 


whoever ’s  turn  it  be,  the  white  will  achieve  a  draw,  as  a 
meticulous  analysis  confirms. 

Analogically  transferred  to  the  chessboard569  (8x8)  one  cannot 
win  the  endgame,  because  the  stronger  side  is  unable  to  carry 
the  pieces  to  the  black  lines.  Victory  is  achieved  in  the  cases 
mentioned  and  similar  positions.  Thus  with  the  help  of  strokes 
or  board  limits  which  did  not  allow  double  capture  by  the  black 
opponent.  Although  most  unlikely,  the  endgame  1  might  arise  in 
practice  as  winner  on  the  chessboard  of  8x8.  Therefore  one 
should  avoid  reaching  the  endgame  4  and  the  stronger  side 
should  think  well  before  the  latest  simplification  (endgame  3 
against  2)  and  reach  a  winning  endgame  (see  diagrams  of  the 
endgames  1-3). 

These  rules  were  tested  and  validated  in  these  terms  described 
in  the  meeting  of  Jose  Antonio  Garzon  Roger  with  Jose 
Martinez  Llopart  on  August  2  2003.  It  also  became  clear  that  he 
who  opened  the  game  had  a  worse  game,  and  the  first 
maneuvers  are  intended  to  level  the  game.  For  the  sake  of 
clarity  and  educational  purposes  only,  sacrificing  correction  (if 
necessary),  Garzon  transcribes  the  first  alquerque  12  party  that 
he  developed  with  fidelity  to  the  standard  rules  as  prescribed  in 
the  book  of  King  Alfonso  X  the  Wise  (1283):

As  we  have  seen  before,  Garzon  let  us  know  that  King  Alfonso 
X  the  Wise  stated  in  1283  that  alquerque  12  had  borrowed 
something  from  chess,  backgammon,  and  dice.  Sonja  Mussel 
Golladay570  made  a  translation  of  alquerque  12  into  English  as 
described  in  the  book  of  Alfonso  X  the  Wise.  Here  follows  part

This  is  twelve  men’s  morris  which  is  played  with  all  its  pieces.  Since 
we  have  spoken  in  the  previous  books  of  all  the  ways  of  playing 
chess,  dice,  and  tables  that  those  three  wise  men  showed  as  examples 
to  the  king  and  then  that  intelligent  men  spread  through  play,  we  now 
want  to  tell  you  about  other  games  that  men  later  found  that  are  not 
among  those  discussed  above.  However,  they  have  similarities  like 
mill  takes  some  from  chess,  dice,  and  tables.  There  are  others  that 
take  from  chess  and  tables,  but  not  from  dice. 

And  we  will  begin  first  with  twelve  men’s  morris,  because  it  is  larger 
and  played  with  more  pieces.  And  we  will  tell  you  in  how  many  ways 
it  is  played,  with  how  many  pieces,  and  why  it  has  parts  of  chess, 
tables,  and  dice.  It  has  a  part  of  chess  because  it  is  played  by 
intelligence  and  so  is  mill.  The  48  pieces  with  which  it  is  played 
resemble  the  pawns  of  chess.  And  it  has  a  part  of  tables  because  of  the 
tie  which  ties  the  game  in  the  same  way  and  because  of  the  lines  on 
which  the  pieces  are  played.  And  it  has  a  part  of  dice  due  to  luck, 
because  as  with  the  roll  of  the  dice  there  is  luck,  so  in  mill  players  roll 
to  decide  who  plays  first. 

Garzon  is  one  of  the  best  chess  historians  in  Spain  and  Pratesi  in 
Italy.  Garzon’ s  findings  are  based  on  documents  and  Pratesi’s 
on  a  hypothesis.  It  is  quite  interesting  to  see  that  both  historians 
have  a  completely  opposite  opinion:  Garzon  claims  that  chess  is 
older  than  alquerque  12  and  draughts,  while  Pratesi  claims  that 
draughts  (or  alquerque  12  on  the  line  board)  is  older  than  chess.

11  THE  GAMES  RELATED  TO 
ALQUERQUE 


11.1  Fox  and  geese 

To  idea  of  having  a  triangle  at  the  top  of  the  board  may  have 
come  from  the  fox  and  geese  game  which  was  more  popular  in 
the  northern  countries  and  where  squares  were  used.  I  also 
found  the  game  in  Italy  (Volpe  e  Oche),  in  La  Palma,  and  in 
Tenerife  (Canary  Islands)571  where  they  call  it  ‘El  zorro  y  las 
gallinas’.  Antonio  de  Guevara  was  probably  referring  to  this 
game  when  he  called  it  ‘alquerque  ingles’  (English  alquerque) 
in  his  book572.

Galera,  Madrid  1673,  p.  265

This  game  has  a  long  history  and  dates  back  to  the  Middle  Ages 
in  Europe:  Iceland  and  England.  In  the  case  of  Iceland  the  game 
is  called  Hala-tafl573,  the  Fox  Game  that  is  mentioned  in  the 
Icelandic  “Grettis  saga”.  Dr.  Finnur  Jonsson574  believed  that  this 
saga  was  written  after  1300  A.D.  by  an  anonymous  priest  who 
lived  in  the  northern  part  of  the  island575. 

Murray  states576: 

That  fox  and  gees  was  played  before  the  fifteenth  century  is  evidencd 
by  the  ocurrence  of  boards  incised  on  the  stone  seats  in  the  cloisters  at 
Gloucester  Cathedral.  Here  the  component  squares  only  contain  the 
diagonals,  though  one  diagram  adds  the  missing  lines  to  the  central 
square.  A  complete  board,  scratched  on  a  flat  stone,  was  retrieved 
from  the  well  in  Norwich  Castle,  and  the  board  of  (see  the  above 
board)  also  occurs  in  the  cloisters  of  San  Paolo  without  the  walls, 
Rome  (Miss  K.M.E.  Murray).  In  its  earliest  form  the  game  was 
played  with  thirteen  geese  arranged  as  in  the  drawing  and  the  fox 
which  was  placed  on  any  of  the  vacant  points  (but  usually  on  the 
central  point,  this  being  considered  its  strongest  position).  All  the 
pieces  had  the  same  move,  one  step  along  any  marked  line  through 
the  point  occupied.  The  fox  alone  can  take  which  it  does  by  the  short 
leap  over  a  goose  on  an  adjacent  point  in  the  direction  of  move  to  the 
point  immediately  beyond  the  goose,  and  a  series  of  similar  captures 
may  be  made  in  a  turn  of  play.  The  geese  win  if  they  can  hem  in  the 
fox  so  that  it  cannot  move;  the  fox  wins  if  he  takes  so  many  geese  that 
too  few  are  left  to  enclose  him.  With  reasonable  care  the  geese  should 
always  win.

11.2  Corner  the  rabbit 


According  to  the  manuscript  of  King  Alfonso  X  of  Castile  the 
alquerque  12  board  was  also  used  for  a  hunt  game  called  ‘cercar 
la  liebre’  (Corner  the  rabbit).  The  translation  into  English  is  by 
Sonja  Mussel  Golladay577. 


El  iuego  que  llaman  de  cercar  la 
liebre  quesse  iuega  otrossi  en  ell 
alquerque  de  doze. 

Este  es  otro  iuego  que  se  iuega 
otrossi  en  el  alquerque  de  doze. 
&  llaman  le  el  iuego  de  cercar  la 
liebre.  &  iuegasse  desta  guisa. 
toman  un  trebeio  &  ponenlo  en 
medio  dell  Alquerque.  &  ponen 
doze  dotra  color  en  Az  a  sso  el  o 
onze  o  diez  segunt  ponen 
entressi  so  postura  aquellos  quel 
an  de  iogar. 


Et  iuegan  lo  desta  guisa  ha  de 
andar  primero  aquell  trebeio.  & 
los  otros  quantos  quier  que  sean 
Iuego  empos  ell.  Et  aquel 
trebeio  solo  es  atreguado  quel 
no  an  de  leuar  mas  an  lo  de 
encerrar  en  una  casa;  de  guisa 
que  no  haya  otra  do  yr. _ 


The  game  called  corner  the 
rabbit  that  is  also  played  on  the 
twelve  mill  board. 

This  is  another  game  that  is  also 
played  on  the  twelve  millboard 
and  they  call  it  the  game  of 
corner  the  rabbit  and  it  is  played 
like  this:  they  take  one  piece  and 
place  it  in  the  center  of  the 
board  and  they  put  twelve  of  the 
other  color  in  a  troop  formation 
beneath  him,  or  eleven  or 
ten  as  they  agree  upon  their 
wager  between  them,  those  who 
are  to  play  it. 

And  they  play  it  in  this  way:  that 
[rabbit]  piece  is  to  move  first 
and  the  others,  however  many 
they  are,  then  after  him.  And 
that  single  piece  alone  is  safe 
from  capture  because  they  are 
not  to  remove  but  rather  they 
are  to  trap  him  on  one  space  so

that  there  is  nowhere  else  to  go. 

And  he  will  capture  as  many  of 
the  others  as  he  should  be  able 
to  by  jumping  over  them,  as  we 
said,  from  one  line  to  another 
straight  across.  And  once  that 

piece  has  removed  one  of  the 

578 

others  ,  they  will  not  be  able 
to  trap  him.  But  if  there  were 
twelve  pieces,  by  removing  one 
eleven  remain,  and  they  can 
carry  him  with  them  wherever 
thy  want.  That  same  thing  they 
will  do  with  ten  if  they  know 
how  to  play  it  well.  But  if  of  the 
ten  one  is  removed,  the  nine  that 
remain  never  can  trap  him  in 
any  way,  and  therefore  they  lose 
the  game. 

And  this  is  the  explanation  of 
this  game  and  this  is  the 

diagram  of  the  board  and  of  the 

579 

pieces 


Murray580  calls  this  game  ‘catch  the  hare’,  but  I  prefer  Musser 
Golladay’s  translation  of  ‘corner’,  because  the  idea  of  the  game 
is  to  corner  the  rabbit  to  a  place  from  which  he  cannot  move  or 
escape. 


578  This  is  true  if  they  began  with  ten  pieces  on  that  side. 

579  Here  called  iuegos  instead  of  trebeios  as  before.

Corner  the  rabbit  (Cercar  la  liebre)  -  Manuscript  of  1283. 


roi 

Murray  gives  us  the  following  text  : 

The  men  and  the  hare  are  arranged  as  in  the  diagram.  Both  hare  and 
men  have  the  same  power  of  move,  one  step  along  a  marked  line  in 
any  directions,  the  point  reached  being  empty.  The  power  of  move 
accordingly  varies  from  point  to  point.  The  hare  alone  can  take,  and 
captures  are  made  by  the  short  multiple  leap  of  the  English  draughts. 
The  aim  of  the  game  is  to  enclose  the  hare  so  that  it  can  neither  move 
nor  take.  Alfonso  says  that  this  is  possible  even  if  the  numbers  of 
hunters  is  reduced  to  ten,  and  that  a  good  player  can  give  his 
adversary  the  odds  of  one  or  two  men.

Corner  the  rabbit  (Cercar  la  liebre) 


However,  the  board  used  for  this  game  changed  by  the  time 
and  in  each  change  fewer  diagonals  were  used.

town  of  Siyasa  that  belongs  to  Cieza  in  the  province  of  Murcia 
(Spain)  and  this  board  must  be  from  earlier  than  1266.  It  was 
also  found  in  Tenerife  (Canary  Islands).  It  was  used  for  the

Mexican  game  of  Coyote  &  Chickens  (pon  chochotl)  .  A 
similar  board  was  found  in  the  church  of  Nuestra  Senora  de

Carmen  in  Nava  de  Santullan  (Spain)  .  Archaeologists  were 
not  able  to  discover  the  name  of  this  game,  but  I  think  that  it  is 
nothing  else  than  ‘comer  the  rabbit’  (cercar  la  liebre)  with  a 
variant,  seeing  the  two  extending  diagonals. 


Board  3  was  found  in  Spain  and  only  in  Fuerteventura  (Canary

Islands)  .  It  was  used  by  the  Tigua  of  New  Mexico  for  Indian 
and  Jack-rabbits.

11.3  Taptana 

A  taptana  board  was  found  at  Chinchero,  Peru,  near  the  capital 
Cuzco,  etched  onto  a  preHispanic  wall.  This  board  has  been 
used  as  an  argument  that  Komikan  or  Tapana  is  a  preHispanic 
or  preColumbin  indigenous  game  of  South  America. 

However,  the  opening  position  in  the  Taptana  game  is  similar  to 
the  Spanish  game  of ‘Catch  the  hare’  (cercar  la  liebre).  The  only 
difference  lies  in  the  expanded  alquerque  board  with  one 
triangle.  This  can  have  two  causes.  The  additional  triangle  was 
introduced  by  the  Spanish  or  Italian  priests  known  for  their 
missionary  actions  in  China  and  Japan  in  the  16th  century  or  the 
board  was  enlarged  by  the  Chinese  or  Japanese  seamen  who 
established  themselves  in  Peru. 

However,  I  do  not  think  that  this  type  of  alquerque  12  board  is 
of  preHispanic  origin.  On  the  other  hand  we  must  remember 
that  the  Jesuits  around  1582  initiated  missionary  work  in  China. 
Years  later  we  see  Chinese  Jesuits  in  Europe,  for  example 
Michael  Shen  Fu-Tsung,  who  taught  Chinese  to  Thomas 
Hyde585.  Logically  speaking,  in  this  way  other  Chinese  Jesuits 
could  have  travelled  to  Peru.  So  it  is  quite  important  to  firstly 
know  the  age  of  the  alquerque  boards.

11.3.1  The  triangle  in  the  game  of  Taptana 

Now  knowing  more  about  the  game  board  used  for  the  fox  and 
gees  game  it  is  easier  to  understand  that  the  game  board  for  the 
game  of  Taptana  in  Peru  had  a  triangle.  Thus  the  normal 
alquerque  12  board  was  enlarged  with  a  triangle.  Maybe  some 
of  the  seamen  who  stayed  at  Peru  came  from  Italy  or  there  were 
missionaries  from  Rome.  All  that  is  difficult  to  investigate  now, 
but  there  are  many  reasons  to  believe  that  this  was  a  new  game 
for  the  Indians. 

It  is  quite  possible  that  the  alquerque  12  game  was  already  used 
in  Spain  with  a  triangle,  but  we  do  not  have  written  proofs  of 
this.  The  archaeological  findings  do  not  prove  this  fact  either. 
However,  the  triangle  was  known  in  Europe  in  one  alquerque 
board  game  and  I  found  the  proof  in  France,  where  in  the 
Middle  Ages  an  alquerque  9  game  was  played  with  a  triangle. 
For  that  we  have  to  go  to  a  small  village  in  the  north  of  France 
of  734  inhabitants  called  Larchant.

In  this  small  village  the  Grotte  a  la  Peinture  is  one  of  the  most 
remarkable  shelters.  Besides  the  classical  engravings  carved 
into  the  sandstone  during  the  Mesolithic  (9-10,000  years)  one 
finds,  traces  of  paint  that  date  from  the  Upper  Paleolithic

adorn  this  classic  free  [classic  free  what?  Something's  missing

know  metals  -  in  these  shelters  people  found  grooves,  holes,  and 
the  alquerque  9  drawing,  mysterious  symbols  quite  common  in 
this  type  of  shelter  and  these  drawings  could  go  back  to  the 
early  Middle  Ages.

11.4  The  solitario  game 

Taptana  or  Komikan  has  several  variants,  because  there  are 
different  triangular  patterned  board  designs  attached  to  the 
alquerque  board.  The  standard  triangular  board  (with  one 
horizontal  line  across  the  breadth  of  the  triangle  and  one  vertical 
line  along  the  length  of  the  triangle)  described  by  Stewart 
Culin586  in  1 898  (as  Solitario)  is  only  one  of  them.

11.5  The  Komikan  game 

587 

In  1918-19  Leotardo  Matus  Zapata  described  a  Komikan 
board  with  a  triangular  board  with  two  horizontal  lines  across  its 
breadth,  a  single  vertical  line  along  its  length,  and  two  shorter 
vertical  lines  where  the  shorter  horizontal  line  (the  one  closest 
to  the  alquerque  board)  intersects  with  the  two  sides588  of  the 
triangle. 

El  sacerdote  Juan  Ignacio  Molina  (1740-1829)589  let  us  know 
that  the  Araucanins  knew  the  Komikan  game  and  Manquilef590 
informed  that  the  Komikan  game  was  still  played  in  the  early 
20th  century.  Komikan  is  the  game  of  the  lion  and  the  sheep  in 
Chile.  For  up-to-date  information  on  the  situation  of  this 
boardgame  it  is  necessary  to  consult  the  great  study  of  Thierry 
Depaulis.

11.6  The  Adugo  game

is  played  by  1  Jaguar  and  14  dogs.  The  rules  are  the  same  as  in 
Taptana  (Peru)  or  Komikan  (Chile,  Argentine).  Adugo  is  played

11.7  Shap  Luk  Kon  Tseung  Kwan 

Where  did  the  Incas  obtain  the  expanded  alquerque  board  from? 
This  seems  to  be  a  mystery  to  this  day,  because  according  to 
Murray  an  expanded  alquerque  board  with  one  triangle  was 
only  known  in  Asia,  namely  in  China  and  Japan.  The  game  in 
China  that  consists  of  16  soldiers  and  1  general  is  known  there 
under  the  name  of  Shap  luk  kon  tseung  kwan.  Murray  describes 
the  game  as  follows591: 


Shap  luk  kon  tseung  kwan  -  China  (Culin) 


592 


One  player  has  sixteen  soldiers  and  the  other  a  general,  placed 
as  in  the  figure.  All  the  pieces  have  the  same  move,  one  step 
along  any  marked  line  of  the  board,  but  the  general  alone  can 
enter  the  triangle,  and  if  he  is  confined  to  the  triangle,  he  loses.

-381  - 


Both  general  and  soldiers  can  capture,  but  in  different  ways. 
The  general  takes  by  intervention  by  occupying  the  point 
immediately  between  two  soldiers  on  the  same  marked  line, 
when  he  takes  both;  the  soldiers  by  interception  by  occupying 
the  points  immediately  on  both  sides  of  the  general,  both 
soldiers  and  general  being  on  the  same  marked  line.  Thus,  in  the 
position  diagrammed,  if  the  soldiers  play  first  and  move  e2-d2, 
the  general  may  reply  c3-b2,  taking  the  soldiers  on  a3  and  cl  by 
intervention;  but  now  the  soldiers  may  move  d2-c2  and  take  the 
general  by  interception.  Since  the  interception  capture  is  more 
primitive  than  the  leap  capture  in  war-games,  this  may  be  an 
older  type  of  hunt-game  than  the  others.

Another  game  known  in  Japan  as  Juroku  musahi  also  has  16 

rgo 

soldiers  and  1  general.  Murray  describes  the  game  as  follows  : 


One  player  has  a  general  (taisho)  and  the  other  sixteen  soldiers 
(musashi)  which  are  arranged  as  in  the  diagram.  All  the  pieces 
have  te  same  move,  one  step  along  a  marked  line  through  the 
point  on  which  the  piece  stands,  but  the  general  alone  can  enter 
the  triangle,  and  if  he  is  confined  to  it,  he  loses.  The  general 
alone  can  capture,  and  he  does  so  by  the  short  leap  of  the 
draughtsman.  The  general  wins  if  the  takes  all  the  soldiers,  and

the  soldiers  win  if  they  reduce  the  general  to  immobility  or 
confine  him  to  the  triangle. 


11.9  Rimau  Rimau 

Another  expanded  alquerque  board  with  two  triangles 
(mountains)  is  used  for  the  tiger  game  in  Malaya595  known  as 
Rimau  Rimau.  There  is  a  version  with  22  and  24  pieces.  I  only 
describe  here  the  version  with  24  pieces  called  orange-orange 
(men). 


In  the  opening  position  two  tigers  are  placed  at  the  vertex  of  the 
two  mountains  that  connects  to  the  alquerque  board.  Nine  men 
are  initially  placed  on  the  nine  intersection  points  of  the  central 
square  of  the  alquerque  board.  Throughout  the  game  pieces  are 
always  situated  on  the  intersection  points  and  move  along  the 
marked  lines  between  them.  The  tiger  player  moves  first  and

removes  any  3  men  from  the  board.  Then  the  tiger  player  may 
also  pick  up  one  of  his  tigers,  and  reallocate  it  to  any  empty 
point  on  the  board,  or  the  tigers  can  simply  remain  where  they 
are.  The  man  player  moves  next,  and  must  drop  his  remaining 
15  pieces  on  any  vacant  intersection  point  on  the  board  one 
piece  per  turn  before  he  can  begin  to  move  any  of  them.  This 
will  take  15  turns.  Players  alternate  their  turns.  The  tigers  can 
move  and  capture  from  the  beginning. 

After  the  15  men  have  been  dropped,  the  men  can  begin  to 
move.  Only  one  man  may  be  moved  in  a  turn.  A  man  moves  in 
any  available  direction  along  a  marked  line  onto  a  vacant  point. 
Similarly,  only  one  tiger  may  be  moved  in  a  turn.  A  tiger  moves 
(in  any  available  direction)  along  a  marked  line  onto  a  vacant 
adjacent  intersection  point.  Alternatively  a  tiger  can  capture. 
Men  cannot  capture.  Tigers  can  capture  an  odd  number  of  men 
(e.g.  1,  3,  5,  or  7).  The  tiger  must  be  adjacent  to  the  man  or  line 
of  men,  and  leap  over  them  onto  a  vacant  intersection  point 
immediately  beyond.  Jumped  pieces  are  removed  from  the 
board.  The  tiger  must  leap  over  them  in  a  straight  line  that 
follows  the  pattern  on  the  board.  If  more  than  one  man  is 
captured  in  the  leap,  the  men  must  be  have  been  lined  up  next  to 
each  other  with  no  vacant  points  between  them.  Once  a  man  or 
a  line  of  men  is  leaped  over  and  captured,  the  tiger  can  no 
longer  capture  further  or  move.  Captures  are  not  compulsory.  If 
the  men  are  reduced  to  10  or  11  pieces,  the  men  will  usually 
resign  as  there  are  not  enough  of  them  to  effectively  immobilize 
the  two  tigers. 

The  ability  of  the  two  tigers  to  capture  more  than  one  man 
might  give  a  tremendous  advantage  to  the  tigers,  and  therefore 
it  is  preferable  that  the  tigers  be  allowed  to  capture  only  one 
man  per  turn.

11.10  Bagh  Chal 

A  very  popular  game  in  Nepal  is  Bagh  Chal  played  with  4  tigers 
and  20  goats  on  the  ancient  alquerque  12  board.  The  rules  of 
this  game  are  as  follows: 

At  the  start  of  the  game  all  four  tigers  are  placed  on  the  four 
comers  of  the  grid,  facing  the  center.  All  goats  start  off  the 
board.  The  pieces  must  be  put  at  the  intersections  of  the  board 
lines  and  moves  follow  these  lines.  The  player  controlling  the 
goats  moves  first  by  placing  a  goat  on  a  free  intersection  on  the 
board.  Then  it  is  the  tigers'  turn.  One  tiger  is  then  moved  to  an 
adjacent  position  along  the  lines  that  indicate  the  valid  moves. 
Moves  are  alternate  between  players.  Tigers  capture  goats  by 
jumping  over  them  to  an  adjacent  free  position.  Goats  cannot 
move  until  all  20  have  been  put  on  the  board. 


Bagh  Chal,  the  Nepali  Tigers  Game,  on  the  alquerque-12  board 


-  386  - 


The  tigers  must  move  according  to  these  rules: 

1.  They  can  start  capturing  goats  any  moment  after  the 
match  has  started 

2.  They  can  capture  only  one  goat  at  a  time 

3.  They  can  jump  over  a  goat  in  any  direction,  but  it  must 
be  to  an  adjacent  intersection  following  any  of  the  lines 
drawn  on  the  board 

4.  A  tiger  cannot  jump  over  another  tiger 

The  goats  must  move  according  to  these  rules: 

1 .  They  must  leave  the  board  when  captured 

2.  They  cannot  jump  over  the  tigers  or  other  goats 

3.  They  can  only  move  after  all  20  have  been  put  on  the 
board 

The  tigers  win  once  they  have  captured  five  goats.  Goats  try  to 
avoid  being  captured  (jumped  over)  and  they  win  by  blocking 
the  tigers'  moves  till  the  tigers  are  unable  to  move.  Sometimes 
the  game  can  fall  into  a  repetitive  cycle  of  positions;  especially 
the  goats  may  use  this  resort  to  defend  themselves  from  being 
captured.  In  order  to  avoid  this  kind  of  situation,  an  additional 
rule  has  been  established:  when  all  the  goats  have  been  placed, 
it  is  not  allowed  to  perform  any  move  that  causes  any  situation 
of  the  pieces  that  has  been  already  repeated  during  the  same 
game.

11.11  BaghBandi 

There  is  a  variety  of  this  game  known  under  the  name  of  Bagh 
Bandi,  but  the  difference  between  Bagh  Chal  and  Bagh  Bandi 
lies  mainly  in  the  opening  position  of  the  game.

Bagh  bandi 


One  player  is  the  tiger;  the  other  are  the  goats.  The  tiger  has  two 
game  pieces  (stones),  while  the  goats  have  20  game  pieces.  The 
goat  game  pieces  are  stacked  in  four  piles  of  five  stones  each  on 
the  center  points  of  the  four  quadrants.  The  tiger  stones  are 
placed  between  them  with  one  on  the  exact  middle  intersection 
and  the  second  on  the  middle  of  the  end  line  in  front  of  the 
person  playing  as  tiger.  The  object  is  for  the  tiger  to  capture  all 
the  goats  and  for  the  goats  to  immobilize  the  tiger  by  moving 
stones  to  adjacent  intersections.  The  tiger  player  may  move  one 
tiger  stone  to  an  adjacent  cell  (adjacency  is  given  by  board 
lines)  or  may  capture  a  goat  by  jumping  a  stack  of  goats  (just 
capturing  the  top  goat)  and  landing  on  the  next  cell  which  must 
be  empty.  Jumps  may  be  multiple,  but  a  tiger  cannot  jump  into 
the  previous  cell  (so  a  tiger  cannot  jump  back  and  forth  to 


-  388  - 


capture  one  stack  of  goats).  The  goat  player  may  take  the  top 
goat  of  a  stack  and  place  it  on  an  adja-  cent  empty  cell  or  move 
a  single  goat  to  an  adjacent  empty  cell.  The  goats  start  the  game. 
The  tiger  wins  if  all  the  goats  are  captured,  and  the  goat  wins  if 
both  tigers  are  immobilized596.

11.12 


The  lion  and  sheep  game 


There  is  another  game  that  can  be  played  on  the  alquerque  12 
board  and  the  Incas  gave  it  the  names  Taptana,  Komina, 
Comina,  Cumi,  Puma,  or  Inca  Chess. 

The  game  may  also  be  known  in  Peru  as  Kukuli.  Komikan  is  a 
tiger  hunt  game  since  it  uses  an  expanded  alquerque  board.  Like 
all  hunt  games,  there  are  two  unequal  forces  at  play.  In 
Komikan  one  player  has  only  a  single  piece  (usually  called  a 
"puma"  or  "jaguar"),  or  komikelu  or  leon  (Spanish  for  lion), 
which  can  move  one  space  at  a  time  or  capture  the  other  player's 
pieces  by  hopping  over  them.  The  other  player  has  twelve 
pieces  (usually  called  "sheep"),  or  perros  or  perritos  (Spanish 
for  "dogs"  and  "doggies”)  that  can  only  move  one  space  at  a 
time,  but  not  capture,  and  attempts  only  to  surround  and 
immobilize  the  puma  or  jaguar.  Pieces  must  move  and/or 
capture  following  the  pattern  on  the  board. 


11.13  The  game  of  the  wolves 

Thanks  to  the  generous  collaboration  of  the  archaeologist  Mr. 
Jose  Maria  Cantarero  Quesada  we  have  a  description  of  another 
game  played  on  the  alquerque  12  board  in  his  town  of  Banos  de 
la  Encina,  in  the  province  of  Jaen. 

In  this  place  they  still  play  the  game  of  the  wolves  (derived 
from  ‘cercar  de  la  liebre’).  This  game  is  played  on  the  board  of 
alquerque  12,  but  the  rules  vary.  In  alquerque  12  each  player 
has  twelve  pawns  of  a  different  colour.  In  the  game  of  wolves 
one  player  has  two  major  pieces  -  wolves,  and  another  player 


-390- 


twenty  minor  pieces  -  sheep.  In  this  game  the  sheep  win  their 
piece  when  they  arrive  at  one  of  the  two  intersections  where  the 
wolves  were  initially  placed.  After  reaching  this  intersection  the 
piece  is  taken  away  from  the  board  and  comes  into  the 
possession  of  the  player  who  moves  the  pieces  of  the  sheep.  The 
move  of  the  sheep  is  forward  and  sideward,  but  never 
backwards. 


The  game  of  the  wolves

Of  course,  the  arrangement  of  the  pieces  on  the  board  has  no 
relation  to  each  other.  The  player  who  moves  the  sheep  can 
eliminate  a  wolf  from  the  game,  but  it  does  not  assign  points  to 
the  player.  For  that  purpose  it  is  necessary  to  block  the  wolf  in 
three  moves.  In  the  previous  photo  we  see  that  the  wolf  in  the 
comer  cannot  move  his  piece,  but  the  sheep  must  realize  the 
blocking  in  three  moves.  If  we  suppose  that  in  the  diagram  the 


-391  - 


sheep  have  waited  only  two  moves  and  after  waiting  three 
moves  they  can  capture  the  wolf,  it  is  clear  that  in  the  diagram 
the  other  wolf  will  capture  the  piece  on  square  13.  So  the  wolf 
will  jump  over  the  piece  on  13  and  put  himself  on  square  7, 
thus  the  piece  on  13  now  belongs  to  the  player  who  moves  the 
wolves. 


Blocking  of  the  wolf

The  sheep  cannot  jump  over  the  wolf  and  cannot  capture  it  by 
jumping  like  they  can  in  draughts.  The  only  way  to  capture  a 
wolf  is  by  means  of  blocking,  as  explained  before. 


-392  - 


The  wolves  capture  the  sheep  as  a  flying  king597,  as  in  the 
Spanish  draughts.  Supposing  that  in  the  previous  diagram  the 
wolf  is  in  the  comer  on  square  25  and  that  there  is  a  sheep  on 
square  13  and  no  sheep  on  square  1,  the  wolf  must  capture  with 
25  x  7.  He  has  to  stop  at  the  square  immediately  behind  the 
captured  piece.  It  cannot  capture  25x1,  thus  to  the  unoccupied 
square  on  1 .  This  is  forbidden  in  the  game.  The  leap  of  the  wolf 
is  big,  but  the  capture  of  the  sheep  by  the  wolf  is  immediately 
after  the  piece  captured,  even  in  case  when  the  wolf  can  capture 
2  or  more  pieces.  The  wolf  is  obliged  to  capture  the  sheep.  If  the 
wolf  fails  to  capture  one  or  more  sheep,  his  opponent  (  the 
sheep  player)  as  penalty  may  remove  the  piece(s)  that  should 
have  captured  form  the  board.  This  is  called  the  ‘huff  or 
‘blow’,  and  does  not  constitute  a  move.  After  blowing  the  sheep 
player  may  make  a  move. 

In  the  following  diagram  we  see  that  the  sheep  cannot  move  the 
sheep  on  square  16  to  21,  because  square  21  is  occupied  by  a 
wolf.  The  sheep  player  is  obliged  to  move  the  sheep  on  square 
20  to  25,  since  square  25  is  unoccupied.  Of  course,  the  sheep 
can  also  play  6  to  11,  but  in  such  case  the  wolf  will  huff  /  blow 
the  sheep  on  20  and  make  any  other  desired  move.  When  the 
sheep  have  a  piece  near  squares  21  and  25,  they  are  obliged  to 
move  their  piece  to  one  of  these  squares.  If  not,  the  wolf  will 
blow  their  piece. 

In  alquerque  12  the  winner  is  he  who  leaves  the  enemy  without 
pawns.  In  the  game  of  wolves,  if  the  wolf  wants  to  win  the 
game,  it  has  to  eat  more  than  eight  pawns  and  more  than  twelve 
sheep.  A  tie  is  achieved  with  eight  against  twelve  sheep. 


597  In  Spanish  draughts  kings  can  move  as  far  as  they  want  along  unblocked 
diagonals.  This  move  can  end  by  a  capture  in  the  usual  way,  jumping  over 
one  or  more  opposing  pieces  to  an  adjacent  unoccupied  square.

Today  people  think  that  apart  from  draughts  alquerque  12  is 
also  a  precursor  or  ancestor  of  the  Malagasy  Fanorona,  of  the 
Mozambique  Borboleta,  of  the  Mauritanian  Strand,  of  the 
Moroccan  Felli,  or  of  the  North  African  Fetach.  It  shows 
similarities  with  the  snakes  fight  (Luta  de  Serpentes), 
Zuni/Navajo  Indian  tribes,  and  Peralicatuma  game  of  the 
American  Indians.

11.14  Five  in  a  row 

The  Romans  played  a  wide  variety  of  board  games.  Calculi  is 
most  like  the  Roman  game,  Five  in  a  Row.  An  alquerque  12 
drawing  might  have  been  used  for  such  purpose.  The  Romans 
referred  to  this  game  as  ludus  calculorum.  However,  the 
references  are  general  and  unclear598.  Some  historians  and 
archeologists  have  referred  to  this  game  as  Roma  Draughts.  It  is 
better  to  take  into  account  what  R.C.  Bell599  says: 

There  is  some  doubt  if  this  game  was  ever  played,  or  if  it  was  an 
invention  of  J.  Gelli,  who  described  it  in  his  Come  posso  divertirmi? 
(Milan,  1900).  According  to  this  author  the  game  was  played  on  the 
alquerque  board,  and  each  player  had  five  men  which  were  entered  on 
the  points,  one  at  a  time  in  alternate  turns  of  play.  When  all  were 
positioned,  they  acquired  the  power  of  moving  one  step  along  any 
marked  line  to  a  contiguous  point.  The  aim  was  to  align  five  men  on  a 
marked  line. 

In  Catalonia  five  in  a  row  is  known  by  the  term  of  cine  en 
ratlla600.  However,  I  also  found  the  term  Mulinello  Quadrupio. 
Did  the  authors  Beltran  de  Heredia  Bercero  and  Miro  I  Alaix 
obtain  the  idea  of  five  on  a  line  from  the  book  of  J.  Gelli?  The 
term  cine  en  ratlla  for  a  game  with  pieces  played  on  the 
alquerque  12  board  is  new  to  me,  since  I  could  not  find  it  in  old 
books.

It  is  therefore  quite  clear  that  different  games  could  be  played 
on  the  alquerque  12  board  in  the  past.  Therefore  it  is  not  easy  to 
establish  which  game  was  played  on  the  alquerque  12  board  in 
the  ancient  time. 

One  thing  is  clear:  people  in  Spain  played  a  lot  of  games.  Not 
only  in  the  XV  and  XVI  century,  but  even  much  earlier,  in  the 
XIII  century,  as  can  still  be  seen  in  the  cathedral  of 
Salamanca601.

Ludus  Rebellionis  D 


In  the  Perugian  Manuscript  written  by  the  Jew  Francesch 
Yicent  there  is  a  board  position  known  as  the  Ludus 
Rebellionis  D  (folio  165r).  The  “D”  may  refer  to  the  new 
movement  of  the  Queen,  thus  the  new  powerful  Dama.  This 
game  apparently  has  some  similarities  with  the  game  of  the 
wolves,  where  the  movement  of  the  Dama  is  like  a  flying  King.

Ludus  Rebellionis  D 

Manuscript  of  Cesena  (1504)  and  Perugia,  (1504-1506) 

However,  there  is  a  difference.  Where  in  the  game  of  wolves 
there  are  two  wolves  with  the  same  power,  in  Ludus  Rebellionis 
we  do  not  see  two  wolves,  but  one  King  and  one  flying  Queen 
or  Dama.  The  last  mentioned  piece  corresponds  to  the  new 
powerful  move  of  the  Dama.  In  this  game  we  also  have  four 
rows  of  sheep  (pions)  as  in  the  game  of  wolves,  but  in  this  case 


GARZON  ROGER,  Jose  Antonio  (2005)  The  return  of  Franchesch 
Vicent.  The  history  of  the  Birth  and  Expansion  of  Modem  Chess,  pp.  436- 
440 


-  397  - 


the  rows  have  only  4  pieces  (total  16  pieces)  and  not  five  as  in 
the  game  of  wolves  that  has  a  total  of  20  pieces.  There  are 
marks  similar  to  the  letter  v  on  squares  £8,  h8,  and  h6,  of  which 
the  purpose  is  unknown.  This  checkerboard  variant  is  also 
largely  discussed  by  Parlett603. 

The  creator  of  this  new  game  with  the  powerful  Dama,  the 
Yalencian  Francesch  Vicent,  left  the  Kingdom  of  Valencia  in 
1501.  This  can  be  concluded  with  the  fact  that  still  in  1500 
Francesch  Vicent  had  the  important  position  of  Justice  in 
Segorbe604,  his  hometown.  Just  in  January  of  1500  the  famous 
Valencian  synagogue  was  discovered  that  had  been  run  secretly 
by  the  Vives  family.  Precisely  in  1501  the  tribunal  decided  to 
arrest  those  suspected  of  attending  services  and  therefore  many 
Jews  tried  to  escape  or  hid605.  There  was  again  persecution 
against  the  Jews  and  it  was  better  for  them  to  seek  safer  places. 
This  means  that  in  all  likelihood  Francesch  Vicent  did  not  hold 
this  position  in  1501  for  the  whole  year,  but  possibly  for  some 
time  in  1501,  and  that  he  was  in  Roma  in  December  1501  to 
present  the  wedding  of  Lucrezia  Borgia  and  Alfonso  D’Este. 
This  very  fact  fits  in  perfectly  with  his  presence  in  Ferrara,

Jose  Antonio  Garzon  Roger  esteems  that  the  Manuscript  of 
Cesena  is  from  around  1502.  The  brother  of  Lucrezia  Borgia, 
Cesare  lived  in  the  city  of  Cesena  for  some  years  and  it  is  well 
documented  that  Cesare  Borgia  made  continuous  visits  to  his 
sister  Lucrezia  during  the  period  1502  -  1503  from  Cesena,

Cesena’s  Manuscript606.  This  manuscript  is  more  or  less  the 
same  as  the  Perugia  Manuscript  and  both  manuscripts  are  fully

Malatestiana  Library  at  Cesena 

The  Cesena  Manuscript  was  discovered  by  Franco  Pratesi607  in 
the  Malatestiana  Library  (Biblioteca  Malatestiana)  in  Cesena. 
This  was  the  first  European  civic  library  and  it  dates  back  to 
1452.  The  manuscript  of  Cesena  of  356  pages  has  a  lot  of 
similarities  with  the  Perugia  Manuscript.  The  Codex  in  the 
register  of  the  library  is  recorded  as  Ludi  varii,  idest  Ludus

In  the  latest  case  it  is  clear  that  the  game  refers  to  a  game  on  the 
chessboard  in  which  sheep  are  taken;  thus  the  game  of  the 
wolves  and  sheep.  Many  still  empty  diagrams  in  the  manuscript

It  is  important  to  know  that  the  Jewish  people  of  the  Kingdom 
of  Valencia  had  good  contact  with  Italy.  The  role,  after  the  edict 
of  expulsion  in  1492,  by  the  converted  Jewish  communities  and 
families  that  left  the  Crown  of  Aragon,  Zaragoza,  and  Gerona,

but  also  Valencia609  in  relationship  to  the  silk  business  in  Italy  is 
clear.  The  Jews  continued  their  businesses  there  and  were  found 
even  in  Perugia610  and  Arezzo.  Many  prominent  Valencian 
families  lived  in  Italy  during  these  years  and  we  will  give  an 
example  of  social  promotion  strategies  of  the  Lopi?  family.  Joan 
and  Jeromi  Lopi?,  children  of  the  notary  Lopi?,  of  16  and  15 
years  respectively,  embarked  in  1470  on  the  beach  of  Grao  of 
Valencia,  in  a  Venetian  galley  that  would  lead  them  to  Italy. 
Jerome  studied  law  in  Bologna  until  the  summer  of  1478.  Joan 
moved  from  Bologna  to  Rome  around  1474  with  a  bachelor's 
degree  in  theology  in  his  possession  in  order  to  be  at  the  service 
of  Cardinal  Rodrigo  de  Borja.  Some  years  later  we  see  Joan's 
access  to  the  Bishops  of  Perugia611  in  1493. 

The  fact  that  Perugia  had  a  Spanish  Bishop  is  important, 
because  this  would  facilitate  Francesch  Vicent  to  enter  into  his 
service.  However,  Joan  Lopi9  (Juan  Lopez)  was  only  Bishop  in 
Perugia  between  29  December  1492  and  15  October  1498. 
However,  there  was  again  a  Spanish  Bishop  between  4  August

Now  that  we  have  described  the  situation  of  the  Jews  in  the 
Kingdom  of  Valencia,  the  reader  will  more  easily  understand 
the  fact  that  Francesch  Vicent  dedicates  three  diagrams  to 
Ludus  rebellionis  (The  Game  of  Rebels).  Parlett  also  refers  to 
this  game  which  presumably  depicts  a  rebellion  against  the 
King  and  Queen616.  In  Ludus  Rebellionis  C.,  another  innovation 
of  Francesch  Vicent,  we  see  again  a  type  of  a  draughts,  but  that 
cannot  be  draughts  since  the  two  rows  in  the  middle  of  the 
board  are  occupied  by  pawns.  We  even  see  a  King  (Rey)  and 
Dama  (Queen)  on  each  side.  On  the  other  hand  certain  three 
squares  on  both  sides  have  again  marks  similar  to  the  letter  ‘v’.

12  ALQUERQUE-12  CHANGING  IN 
DRAUGHTS 


12.1  Foreign  draughts  terms 

The  definition  of  the  term  juego  de  damas  (in  French:  Jeu 
de  dame;  in  English:  Draughts). 

When  we  speak  about  draughts,  we  are  thinking  of  a  game  that 
is  using  damas  or  kings  on  the  board.  However,  there  is 
considerable  confusion  about  the  origin  of  Draughts  among 
scholars.  And  this  has  been  so  from  the  beginning.  Even  the 
writers  of  the  Draughts  books  in  the  sixteenth  century  had  this 

/T  i  n 

problem.  Rodrigo  Caro  in  his  book  of  1624  says  that  it  is  a 
very  ancient  game  and  everything  indicates  that  he  borrowed 
texts  from  Pantoja  de  Ayala  ,  because  this  writer  in  his  Latin 
book  refers  by  draughts  to  an  ancient  game  where  you  capture 
the  enemy  pieces  by  surrounding  them;  Pedro  Ruiz  Montero619 
(1591)  says  that  the  famous  lawyer  Scaevola  played  draughts; 
Lorenzo  Vails620  “El  Valenciano”  (1597)  does  not  say  that  it  is 
an  old  game,  because  with  the  term  ‘nuestro  juego’  (our  game)

he  considered  it  to  be  of  Valencia  and  Juan  de  Timoneda 
(1635  edited  in  Toulouse  ),  the  bookseller,  printer,  and  poet  of 
Valencia,  with  texts  in  his  book  of  c.  1518  does  not  mention 
ancient  times,  but  with  his  term  ‘nuestro  Marro  de  punta’  (our 
Marro  de  punta  -  old  Spanish  name  for  draughts)  considered  it 
to  be  a  new  game  of  Valencia623.  Pedro  Ruiz  Montero  speaks  in 
his  book  of  ‘jugaba  a  la  pelota,  a  las  damas624’  (played  with  the 
ball  and  with  the  Queen  pieces)  and  in  another  place  he  says:  ‘al 
juego  de  las  damas’,  which  means  one  talks  about  a  game 
where  damas  (Queens)  are  used  and  where  the  term  dama  is 
characteristic  for  this  boardgame. 

The  same  game  owes  its  name  to  the  Dama  piece625,  viz  to  the 
new  powerful  piece  (Queen)  and  as  the  use  of  unlimited  Damas 
was  permitted,  this  entertainment  or  game  was  referred  to  in 
plural  in  Spain  ‘a  las  damas’,  ‘el  juego  de  damas’  or  ‘el  juego  de 
las  damas’.  This  is  different  in  chess  where  each  opponent  could 
normally  only  have  one  Dama  and  this  entertainment  was

de  dames.  Paris,  p.  13

como  se  ha  de  jugar  . (From  the  beginning  I  thought  to  warn  how  one 

has  to  play  our  Marro  de  Punta) 

624  In  15th  century  Spain  the  ‘dama’  had  the  same  meaning  as  Queen  in 
chess.  This  new  powerful  piece  was  quickly  used  in  draughts  too,  with  the 
label  ‘Dama’  in  Spain. 

625  The  poet  in  the  book  of  Lorenzo  Vails  (1597)  clearly  says:  “....Assi 
Lorengo  Vails  es  quien  nos  priva  -  Del  calor  confuso  y  turbulenta  lumbre,  De 
juego  que  de  damas  tiene  el  nombre,...”.  (So  Lorenzo  Vails  is  the  one  who 
deprives  us  of  the  confusing  and  turbulent  heat  fire,  of  the  game  that  has  its 
name  from  the  Damas  (Queens)).

called:  ‘el  ajedrez  de  la  dama’.  It  is  true  that  theoretically 
speaking,  in  chess  one  could  obtain  8  Damas  when  crowning 
the  8  pawns,  but  in  practice  it  is  very  difficult  to  see  two 
crowned  pawns  converted  to  Dama  or  Queen.  Still  today  the 
Italians  use  the  terms  ‘gioco  della  dama’,  ‘la  dama’,  and  ‘alia 
dama626’  when  they  refer  to  draughts.  Observe  that  they  use  the 
singular  noun  form  “dama”  whereas  the  Spaniards  prefer  to  use 
the  plural  noun  form  “damas”. 

In  a  careful  study  done  by  Jose  Antonio  Garzon  Roger 
Timoneda  himself  supplied  us  with  a  very  valuable  piece  of 
evidence  that  shows  not  only  that  he  used  a  chess  text,  but  more 
importantly  that  there  is  a  direct  relationship  between  modern 
chess  and  the  birth  of  draughts627. 

Y  si  acaso  el  negro  tuviere  dama  de  principio  de  juego  para  estar  bien 
puesta  en  el  tablero  ha  la  de  poner  en  la  casa  de  la  “C”. 

Translation: 

And  if  Black  has  a  queen  (Dama)  from  the  beginning  of  the  game  in 
order  to  position  her  well  on  the  board,  she  should  be  placed  on  the 
“C”  square. 

This  is  a  surprising  sentence  which  reveals  the  connection 
between  ‘marro  de  punta’  (draughts)  and  modem  chess. 
Timoneda  proposed  to  start  the  game  with  a  Dame  from  the 
starting  position;  therefore,  like  in  chess,  the  player  would  have

a  Dame  (or  queen)  from  the  start,  and  future  ones  would  be  a 
result  of  queening  pawns,  in  a  similar  way  to  chess. 

We  see  in  the  book  of  Juan  Timoneda  that  he  describes  the 
draughts  game  in  the  following  Spanish  terms:  ‘marro  de 
punta’,  ‘juego  de  marro  que  llaman  de  punta’,  ‘a  jugar  al  marro 
que  llaman  de  punta’,  ‘juego  del  marro  de  punta’,  and  that 
Pedro  Ruiz  Montero  uses  the  terms  ‘el  marro’  and  ‘juego  del 
marro’,  but  these  two  writers  do  not  mention  in  any  place  the 
word  ‘punta’,  something  that  Lorenzo  Vails  does  in  the  tittle  of 
his  book:  ‘marro  de  punta’.  In  Valencia  people  commonly  said 
‘marro  de  punta’,  while  in  the  region  of  Andalucia  people  used 
the  term  ‘jugar  a  las  damas’628  in  1595.  This  must  necessarily 
imply  that  the  game  had  some  development  stages  in  Spain, 
ending  up  in  a  game  that  would  ultimately  be  called  el  juego  de 
damas  (the  game  of  draughts)  between  1550  -  1591,  or  just 
damas  (draughts)  in  Spain  and  exactly  here  is  the  confusion, 
because  in  each  change  of  the  game  when  players  were 
changing  the  rules  they  did  not  immediately  change  the  name  of 
the  game. 


628  In  the  manuscript  of  Alonso  Guerra,  reducido  en  el  mismo  estilo  por  el 
licenciado  Diego  de  Argomedo  en  1658,  we  observe  a  tittle  as:  “libro  para 
jugar  a  las  damas”.  (Book  for  playing  draughts).  The  proprietary  of  the 
manuscript,  Victor  Cantalapiedra  of  Valladolid  stipulates  the  date  of  Alonso 
Guerra  as  1595.

12.2  The  promotion  with  the  Dama  in 
Alquerque-12 

In  1570  the  draughts  game  was  known  in  Mexico  too.  Diego 
Duran629  (1538-1588)  said  about  the  games  used  in  Mexico  by 
the  Indies  of  New  Spain: 

Jugaban  el  juego  del  alquerque,  o  de  las  damas,  imitando  el  juego  que 
nosotros  jugamos  del  adxedris  (...) 

Translation: 

They  played  the  game  of  alquerque,  or  of  “Damas”,  imitating  the 
game  that  we  play  as  the  chess  [board]. 

We  learn  from  Diego  Duran  that  the  Indies  did  not  only  play  the 
ancient  alquerque,  but  also  an  alquerque  game  with  chess  queen 
or  Damas.  In  Spain  it  was  the  chessboard  to  be  used  for 
draughts,  but  in  Mexico  they  did  not  use  the  chess  board  and 
preferred  to  play  on  the  Alquerque  12  board.  This  alquerque  12 
game  with  Damas  (Queens)  was  thus  a  new  game  like  draughts

12.2.1  Quireg  or  Fetach 

The  use  of  Damas  in  alquerque  12  was  also  introduced  in  north 
Africa.  Suddenly  we  see  damas  on  the  normal  alquerque  12 
board  which  is  there  called  Quireq  or  Fetach630.

12.2.2  Damma  (Zamma,  Srand  or  Dhamet) 

Under  the  influence  of  the  word  Dama  after  1550  the  game  was 
then  called  Damma  (Zamma  )  and  the  quadruple  alquerque 
game  was  also  introduced.  This  game  is  called  Srand  or  Dhamet 
in  Mauritania  and  had  undergone  a  great  change  there  between 
the  16th  and  17th  century,  when  draughts  with  Damas  became 
popular  in  many  places  worldwide.

12.2.3  Kharbaga 

In  Mauritania  not  only  the  Damas  were  introduced  to  the  game, 
but  also  the  size  of  the  board  was  completely  changed.  Apart 
from  that  the  pieces  can  only  move  forward  and  the  promoted 
piece,  Mullah,  at  the  last  rank  moves  and  captures  in  any 
direction  through  any  number  of  squares.  It  has  thus  the  same 
moving  and  capturing  power  as  the  Dama  in  Spanish  draughts. 
A  similar  game  ‘Kharbaga633’  is  less  important  in  Mauritania.

12.2.4  Permainan  Dama 


We  know  that  the  Dutch  also  have  a  long  leap  in  their  draughts 
and  this  is  due  to  the  Spanish  presence  in  the  Low  Countries  in 
the  16  century  when  the  Spanish  game  was  introduced  in  the 
Netherlands  and  Belgium  by  the  Spaniards.  Indonesia  suffered  a 
colonial  period  by  the  Dutch  for  many  years  and  the  influence 
of  Dutch  customs  was  also  expressed  in  the  Permainan  Tabal 
game.  This  game  was  an  expanded  alquerque  12  board  with  two 
triangles.  Its  present  name  is  Permainan  Dama. 


Permainan  Tabal  (Permainan  Dama) 

In  Permainan  Tabal  the  pieces  can  move  forward  and  sideways, 
but  not  backward.  Capture  by  a  short  leap  is  performed  in  all 
directions.  Capture  is  compulsory  and  there  is  a  huff  or  penalty 
of  three  pieces  when  the  adversary  forgets  to  capture.  The 
pieces  are  obliged  to  follow  the  pattern  on  the  board.  The  idea 
of  the  game  is  to  capture  all  the  opponent's  pieces.  A  piece 
moves  to  an  empty  adjacent  point.  If  an  adjacent  point  is 
occupied  by  an  enemy’s  piece  and  the  point  directly  behind  is 
vacant,  then  one  can  jump  over  it  and  capture  it,  as  in  draughts 


-415  - 


or  checkers.  Several  pieces  may  be  captured  like  this  in  a  single 
turn.  In  this  variant  the  captured  pieces  are  instantly  removed 
from  the  board.  If  either  party  scores  three  pieces  in  the  triangle, 
they  are  converted  to  a  Dama.  The  Dama  moves  and  captures  in 
all  directions.  It  can  move  any  number  of  squares,  like  the 
Dama  in  international  draughts,  and  land  anywhere  behind  a 
captured  piece.  As  indicated  before,  capture  is  compulsory.  In 
endgames  a  majority  of  only  one  Dama  is  sufficient  for  a  win.

12.2.5  Dablot  prejjesne 

But  there  was  also  a  game  known  as  ‘Dablot  prejjesne'  that  was 
described  in  an  article  by  Nils  Keyland634. 


Dablot  prejjesne 

Image:  www.boardgamesoftheworld.com 


A  doubtful  reference  to  this  game  could  have  been  given  by 
Londholm635  in  a  Swedish  text  of  1884,  but  it  is  not  clear  if  he  is 
referring  to  the  Hnefatafl  or  to  the  Dablot  game.  Nils  states  that 
the  Dablot  prejjesne  game  is  familiar  with  draughts  and 
alquerque,  because  the  rules  are  quite  different  from  the 
hnefatafl  game.  In  the  Dablot  prejjesne  game  each  player  has  a 
King,  a  Prince,  and  28  Peasants.  Just  as  happens  in  a  variety  of 
Italian  draughts,  the  Peasants  (or  pawns  in  the  Italian  draughts

game)  cannot  capture  the  King  and  Prince  (Dama  in  the  Italian 
draughts  game).  However,  the  reference  to  this  Dablot  prejjesne 
game  is  not  earlier  than  the  18th  century. 


12.2.5.1  Other  Viking  games 

There  are  other  similar  Viking  games636  played  on  a  chequered 
board,  with  the  number  of  vertical  squares  being  odd  and  equal 
to  the  number  of  horizontal  squares,  so  that  there  is  a  distinct 
central  square.

Capturing  is  not  by  leaping  over  an  ennemy  piece.  A  piece  is 
captured  and  removed  from  the  board  if  it  comes  between  two 
enemy  pieces,  one  on  each  side  in  vertical  or  horizontal 
direction.  The  king  is  captured  if  he  is  surrounded  by  enemy 
pieces  or  restricted  by  squares  in  all  four  cardinal  points,  so  that 
he  cannot  move  in  any  direction637.  Dablot  prejjesne  is  a  similar 
game  to  Ludus  Rebellionis  C.  that  appears  in  the  Manuscripts  of 
Cesena  and  Perugia  written  by  the  Spanish  Jew  Francesch 
Vicent  from  Valencia,  as  is  indicated  in  an  earlier  chapter  of  this 
book.

12.3  The  characteristics  of  draughts 

Taking  the  previous  information  into  account,  various  draughts 
researchers  have  now  created  some  rules: 

1 .  The  pawn  or  piece  can  be  crowned  in  the  game 

(Ir.  Gerard  Bakker) 

2.  There  are  at  least  two  rows  on  the  board  between  the  two 

initial  positions.  (Rob  Jansen) 

3.  The  number  of  squares  or  intersections  in  the  game  is  even. 

(Rob  Jansen) 

4.  The  enemy  pawns  or  pieces  are  captured  jumping  over 
them  forward,  putting  the  piece  just  behind  the  last  captured 
enemy  pawns  or  pieces. 

5.  Pawns  or  pieces  move  in  a  sole  diagonal  or  orthogonal,  but 
never  in  the  reverse  direction. 

6.  Use  of  the  chessboard  (Ir.  Gerard  Bakker) 

7.  In  case  of  a  line  board,  use  of  the  same  diagonals  as  in 
chess  with  aid  of  the  lines  (Andarraya). 

It  is  worth  noting  that  in  Spain  we  had  various  names  for  the 
precursors  of  draughts  and  draughts  with  Damas: 

All  historical  Western  European  draughts  games  (of  which  the 
Spanish  and  English  draughts  are  the  oldest  forms)  belong  to 
this  definition  of  the  characteristics  of  draughts:  these  forms  are 
now  played  with  two  sets  of  twelve  discs  and  32  squares  of  the 
chessboard  are  used.  The  Turkish  draughts  also  belongs  to  this: 
this  form  is  played  with  two  sets  of  sixteen  discs  and  uses  64 
squares  of  the  chessboard.  The  medieval  game  alquerque  12 


-419  - 


does  not  belong  to  this  group,  because  it  is  not  played  on  a 
chessboard  and  had  no  promotion  .

639 

Turkish  draughts  Spanish  draughts 


The  fact  that  the  medieval  draughts  -  taking  Gerard  Bakker’s 
definition  into  account  -  was  considered  fiction  has  been 
confirmed  by  the  chess  historian  Petzold: 

Bezeichnend  ist,  dass  noch  im  Mittelalter  die  Existenz  des 
Damespiels  nich  eindeutig  bezeugt  ist.  Keine  einzige  Spielsammlung 
enthalt  Hinweise.  Erwahnungen  bei  Boccaccio  und  anderen  Dichtem 
sind  viel  zu  algemein  gehalten,  als  dass  sie  nich  auch  zu  anderen 
Spielen  von  der  Art  der  Muhle  oder  des  Asaltos  passten,  wie  sie 
beispielsweise  im  “Codex  Alfonso”  dargestellt  werden. 

Translation 


It  is  significant  that  even  in  the  Middle  Ages  the  existence  of  the 
draughts  game  is  not  clearly  attested.  No  game  collection  contains 
indication.  Mentions  in  Boccaccio  and  other  poets  are  too  generic,  so 
they  do  not  fit  well  to  be  other  games  such  as  the  morris  type  or 
asaltos,  as  for  example  shown  in  the  “Codex  Alfonso”. 


639  Thomas  Hyde  has  a  diagram  in  his  book  where  we  see  that  the  first  two 
rows  are  used  for  the  16  pieces.  Cfr.  HYDE,  Thomas  (1694b).  De  Ludis 
Orientalibus,  Oxford.  Volume  II,  p.  184.

12.3.1  Draughts  borrowed  promotion  from  chess 

Petzold640  then  asserted  that  the  first  draughts  game  must  have 
borrowed  the  promotion  from  chess  and  not  vice  versa.  Petzold, 
aware  of  the  work  of  Van  der  Stoep,  took  a  clear  standpoint 
against  Van  der  Stoep,  who  had  deposited  in  the  last  sentence  of 
the  last  chapter  of  his  A  History  of  Draughts :  “it  is  equally 
impossible  to  determine  which  game  borrowed  the  promotion 
from  which:  chess  from  draughts  or  vice  versa”.  That  was  in 
1984.  Today  Van  der  Stoep  is  thinking  totally  differently. 

With  regards  to  the  thesis  of  Van  der  Stoep  at  the  University  of 
Leiden641  in  1997  the  draughts  historian  Rob  Jansen  observed 
the  following  in  his  review642: 

As  a  critical  note  one  could  state  that  the  Spanish  literature  has  been 
neglected,  especially  since  it  was  superior  to  the  French  Dame 
[Draughts]  books.  Also  the  comparison  of  words  between  dictionaries 
was  investigated  to  make  a  chronology  of  terms,  while  the 
comparison  of  words  within  one  dictionary  was  neglected  and  could 
have  provided  more  precise  semantics  where  definitions  appeared 
vague  at  first  glance.  Lastly,  the  diagrams  erroneously  suggest  that  it 
is  possible  to  accurately  indicate  the  period  in  which  a  word  was 
common  and  had  certain  meaning. 

It  must  be  said  that  thereafter  Van  der  Stoep  carefully  studied 
the  situation  in  Spain  and  the  result  of  that  was  his  new  book

from  2005  in  which  he  tries  by  all  means  to  demonstrate  that 
chess  was  strongly  influenced  by  draughts643: 


One  of  the  most  characteristic  features  of  chess  is  the  promotion. 
When  chess  was  born  about  500  years  AD,  draughts  with  its 
promotion  rule  had  been  played  for  over2000  years.  There  cannot  be 
any  doubt:  the  first  chess  queen  was  a  copy  of  the  short  king  in 
Roman  draughts.  The  new  15th  c.  chess  queen  was  an  imitation  of  the 
king  in  Spanish  draughts;  its  name  DAMA  was  borrowed  from 
draughts,  Spanish  JUEGO  DE  DAMAS.  In  the  15th  c.  chess 
borrowed  the  long  queen  from  draughts. 

However,  there  are  many  scholars  who  thought  that  draughts 
was  born  from  alquerque  and  chess,  such  as  Van  der  Linden, 
Brunet,  Branch,  Fiske644,  Bakker,  Petzold,  Westerveld,  Garzon, 
and  others.

13  THEORIES  ABOUT  THE 
MEDIEVAL  DRAUGHTS 


13.1  Etymology  has  errors  and  doubts 

Van  der  Stoep  relies  increasingly  on  his  knowledge  of 
etymology.  In  this  sense  he  introduced  in  the  eighties  (jeu  des) 
tables  as  the  name  for  medieval  draughts.  He  repeated  the  above 
evidence  in  1984  in  his  great  work  A  History  of  Draughts  in  the 
following  way645: 

Two  factors  make  me  assume  that  before  the  16th  century  draughts 
hid  under  the  name  of  (jeu  des)  tables,  namely  the  fact  that  Fr.  Dame 
succeeded  Fr.  Table  as  the  name  of  the  man  and  the  probability  that 
jeu  des  tables  still  occurred  in  the  16th  century  as  the  name  of 
draughts. 

In  1980  Van  der  Stoep  still  had  doubts  when  he  stated646:  “but 
the  question  remains:  was  there  actually  draughts  before  1500?” 
But  in  1984  Van  der  Stoep  changed  the  question  of  1980  in  an 
exclamation.  It  is  quite  interesting  to  observe  that  Van  der  Stoep 
in  his  book  of  1984  dedicated  30  pages  to  the  French  “table” 
concept  and  only  10  pages  to  the  “draughts”  concept.

13.2  The  untenable  Marellen  Theory 

When  we  go  to  1991  we  see  that  suddenly  Van  der  Stoep647  in 
an  interview  with  Jan  Wielaard  did  not  believe  anymore  in  his 
tables  theory.  Two  years  later  in  1993  he  stated  in  the  Dutch 
Draughts  Magazine  Hoofdlijn :  “In  1984  I  defended  the  thesis 
that  the  medieval  name  for  the  draughts  game  was  ‘tables’,  but 
this  claim  I  withdraw”648.  So  Van  der  Stoep  posited  a  new 
Marellen  theory  of  the  origin  of  draughts: 

My  thesis  is  now  finished.  I  really  hope  in  1993  or  even  earlier  to 
promote  (...).  My  own  dissertation,  entitled  What  is  the  etymology  of 
Jeu  de  Dames ,  is  an  extended  version  of  my  A  History  of  Draughts , 
but  with  some  new  and  different  views  with  certain  words  (...).  The 
second  question  is  to  ask  yourself  what  is  the  word  for  ‘jeu  de  dames’ 
in  the  Middle  Ages.  (....)  Now  I  have  also  found  the  word  that  stands 
for  ‘Jeu  de  dames’.  I  had  not  discovered  it  when  I  was  writing  my 
book.  I  still  do  not  make  it  public,  so  that  the  magazine  Dammen  gets 
the  scoop.  The  Middle  Dutch  word  for  ‘jeu  de  dames’  is  ‘merellen’, 
the  medieval  French  word  is  ‘merelles',  in  Italian  Marella,  in  Northern 
Spain  Marro.  Now  I  have  a  proof  in  four  languages.  These  words 
mean  in  Dutch,  French,  and  Italian  ‘game  with  discs’  and  ‘jeu  de 
dames’. 

In  the  aforementioned  interview  the  alquerque  12  game  of  the 
Alfonso  Codex  of  1282  was  identified  -  even  defined  -  as 
draughts.  In  this  case  the  historian  Gerard  Bakker  cannot  follow 
Van  der  Stoep  anymore.  If  not  only  the  character  of  the  use  of 
the  chessboard,  but  also  the  promotion  are  abandoned  in  the

definition  of  the  first  draughts  games,  then  not  only  can  this 
alquerque  12  game  be  retrospectively  elevated  to  draughts,  but, 
for  example,  the  ancient  Greek  and  Roman  boardgames  are  also 
eligible  for  that. 

Since  1991  Van  der  Stoep  clarified  his  Marellen  thesis  and 
suddenly  this  game  also  had  promotion.  The  question  here  is 
how  can  we  give  promotion  to  a  game  of  which  we  do  not  know 
the  rules?  Consequently  this  is  fiction  or  speculative  cogitation 
and  not  a  thesis  based  on  documents  or  other  proofs. 

But  what  to  the  French  is  the  ‘jeu  de  Merelle’  or  ‘Merelles’, 
apart  from  the  Alquerque  12  game?  I  noted  at  least  five  boards 
given  by  Jacques  Coupry.  The  first  example  I  give  here  is  a 
round  disc  that  the  French  call  ‘Jeu  de  Marelle’. 


Jeu  de  Marelle 

However,  there  are  other  Marelles  or  Marelle  games  that  follow 
hereafter.  Three  of  them  are  called  in  Spain  ‘alquerque  9’  games 
and  another  game  is  known  as  alquerque  3  that  is  also  called 
‘Jeu  de  Marelle’  in  French.  Finally  a  pawn  for  the  Marelle  game 
is  showed649.

Archaeological  excavations  also  revealed  Marelle  pawns  of 
bone  or  wood.  Not  general  pawns,  of  course,  but  pawns  in 
ceremonial  games  similar  to  draughts  pieces,  though  somewhat 
larger.  Michel  Pastoureau  established  a  typology  of  these  pieces 
and  showed  how,  more  than  the  color  (white  /  red  to  the  mid 
thirteenth  century,  thereafter  white  /  black)  or  even  the  scenery, 
where  the  cannelures  on  the  pawns  helped  in  most  cases  to 
distinguish  the  pieces  of  each  battlefield650.  It  is  clear  that  the

term  'Marelle'  is  a  general  group  term  and  that  one  has  to 
deduce  from  the  text  which  type  of  Marelle  game  exactly  is 
meant. 

In  his  book  from  2005  Van  der  Stoep651  describes  on  many 
pages  the  situation  of  the  alquerque  12  game  (merelle)  and 
again  the  metaphors  of  “merelle”  expresses  according  to  Van 
der  Stoep  a  great  popularity  of  draughts  played  on  lines  in 
France.  I  do  not  agree  with  the  term  ‘draughts’  that  Van  der 
Stoep  used  for  a  merelle  game,  because  for  me  alquerque  12 
(merelle)  is  the  precursor  of  draughts.  However,  there  are  no 
proofs  in  the  book  of  places  where  the  alquerque  12  games  were 
played  in  France.  Nor  did  I  see  the  alquerque  12  game  in  the 
book  of  Beq  de  Fouquieres652.  My  research  for  places  where 
alquerque  12  was  played  in  France  also  did  not  give  the  desired 
results.  Most  alquerque  12  boards  were  located  in  Spain  and 
Italy  as  I  have  proved  in  other  books  of  Alquerque  12. 

Van  der  Stoep  by  all  means  tried  to  prove  that  draughts  was 
played  in  France  or  England  in  medieval  times.  Another  thesis 
by  him  was  about  the  word  ‘checkers’  that  was  made  public  by 
him  through  the  Dutch  draughts  magazin  Hoofdlijn  in  1993. 
According  to  Van  der  Stoep  ‘checkers’  was  draughts  played  in 
medieval  times  .  Hereunder  follows  part  of  what  his 
website654  states  about  this  thesis:

De  eigenwijze  Engelsen 

Gezien  de  grote  invloed  van  de  Franse  cultuur  op  de  Engelse  cultuur 
zullen  ook  de  Engelsen  in  die  tijd  wel  op  het  schaakbord  hebben 
gedamd.  Ze  hebben  echter  de  Franse  naam  voor  het  spel  niet 
overgenomen,  en  dat  geeft  te  denken.  Het  dammen  op  het  schaakbord, 
is  dat  misschien  een  Engelse  vinding?  We  zullen  er  wel  nooit  achter 
komen. 

In  ieder  geval  heette  een  potje  dammen  in  Engeland  in  de  14e  eeuw 
to  play  at  the  checker.  Toegegeven,  een  bewijsplaats  uit  de  14e  eeuw 
is  er  niet,  want  de  twee  oudst  bewaard  gebleven  vermeldingen  van  de 
spelnaam  dateren  van  begin  15e  eeuw.  Toen  was  dammen  in 
Engeland  een  algemeen  bekend  spel.  Een  spel  verspreidt  zich  niet  van 
de  ene  dag  op  de  andere  over  heel  Engeland,  daar  zijn  jaren  voor 
nodig.  Dus  moeten  het  damspel  en  de  naam  play  at  the  checker  al  in 
de  14e  eeuw  in  Engeland  bekend  zijn  geweest. 

We  geven  de  twee  oudste  bewijsplaatsen  van  de  spelnaam.  De 
onbekende  schrijver  van  het  werk  ’’Jacob’s  Well",  vervaardigd  rond 
1410,  waarschuwt  zijn  lezers  voor  de  zonden  waartoe  de  duivel  hen 
probeert  te  verleiden.  Zijn  tijdgenoten  spelen  triktrak  (backgammon), 
schaken  en  dammen.  In  het  Engels  van  die  tijd:  pleyin  at  the  tablys,  at 
the  chesse  &  the  chekyr.  Spelletjes  doen  vond  de  schrijver  heel  erg, 
want  dan  kom  je  in  de  hel.  Wat  later,  in  1426,  was  ook  John  Lydgate 
niet  erg  positief  over  wat  hij  om  zich  heen  zag.  Zondaars  zijn  het,  die 
Engelsen.  Weet  je  wat  de  lords  (dat  zijn  in  die  tijd  de  ridders  op  hun 
kastelen,  tegenwoordig  mensen  van  adel)  voor  erge  dingen  doen?  Stel 
je  voor,  Lords  play  at  ches  and  the  cheker.  Later  werden  deze  twee 
spelnamen  eenvoudiger:  to  play  chess ,  to  play  checkers,  zeggen  de 
Engelsen  tegenwoordig.  Het  bleek  al  eerder:  schaken  en  dammen 
waren  beide  tijdverdrijf  voor  de  betere  standen,  de  tekst  van  Lydgate 
bewijst  het  eens  te  meer. 

Loose  translation: 

The  stubborn  English 

Given  the  influence  of  French  culture  in  the  English  culture  the 
English  would  also  have  played  draughts  on  a  chessboard  in  those 
days.  However,  they  did  not  copy  the  name  of  the  game  and  this 
makes  us  wonder.  Playing  draughts  on  a  chessboard  may  be  an 
English  invention.  We  will  probably  never  find  out.  In  any  case, 
playing  draughts  in  England  in  the  14th  century  was  called  “to  play  at 


-430- 


the  checker”.  Admittedly,  there  is  no  evidence  of  a  place  in  the  14th 
century,  because  the  two  oldest  surviving  records  of  the  game  name 
date  from  early  15th  century.  Then  draughts  was  already  a  well 
known  game  in  England.  A  game  does  not  spread  from  one  day  to 
another  throughout  England,  something  like  that  needs  years.  So  the 
game  and  name  “play  at  the  checker”  must  already  have  been  known 
in  England  as  early  as  the  14th  century.  We  give  the  two  oldest 
evidence  places  of  the  game’s  name.  The  unknown  writer  of  the  work 
Jacob's  Well ,  written  around  1410,  warns  his  readers  of  the  sins  that 
the  devil  tries  to  tempt  them.  His  contemporaries  play  backgammon, 
chess,  and  draughts.  In  English  of  that  time:  pleyin  at  the  tablys,  at  the 
chesse  &  the  cheker.  The  author  found  horrible  playing  games, 
because  then  you  get  into  hell.  Some  time  later,  in  1426,  John 
Lydgate  was  not  very  positive  about  what  he  saw  around  him.  Those 
Englishmen  are  sinners.  Do  you  know  what  the  Lords  (who  in  those 
days  were  the  knights  in  their  castles,  today  people  of  nobility)  do  for 
bad  things?  Imagine,  Lords  play  at  ches  and  the  cheker.  Later  these 
two  game  names  became  simpler:  to  play  chess ,  to  play  checkers,  the 
Englishmen  say  today.  It  was  previously  chess  and  checkers  were 
both  pastime  for  the  better  classes,  the  text  of  Ludgate  proves  it  once 
again. 


But  again,  these  words  in  ancient  time  had  nothing  to  do  with 
the  draughts  game  and  were  used  for  the  chess  game.  Ounce 
again  I  have  to  revert  to  Dr.  Mehl655  who  warns  about  the 
terminology  of  the  ancient  names  and  their  incorrect 
initialization: 

Un  imbroglio  terminologique  est  peut-etre  a  T  origin e  de  nombre  des 
confusions  qui  entourent  Thistoire  de  ce  jeu  (de  dames).  Le  terme 
anglais  “draughts”  est  en  effet  responsable  de  bien  des  erreurs.  II 
apparait  vers  1400  et  concerne  au  depart  tous  les  jeux  qui  consistent  a 
deplacer  des  jetons  sur  un  tablier.  Ce  n’est  qu’a  Tepoque  modeme

been  considered  the  country  of  origin  of  the  ‘damas’,  Mehl’s  work  is 
sensational,  because  Mehl  is  an  expert  in  medieval  history.

Translation: 

A  terminological  confusion  may  be  the  cause  of  many  of  the 
confusions  surrounding  the  history  of  this  game  (of  draughts).  The 
English  term  ‘Checkers’  is  in  fact  responsible  for  many  errors.  It 
appears  in  1400  and  it  refers  to  all  games  that  involve  moving  pawns 
on  a  board.  Only  in  modem  times  has  it  become  the  equivalent  of 
what  is  still  called  the  game  of  draughts. 

Eales656  said  that  the  hypothesis  of  medieval  boards,  also 
meaning  ‘draughts’,  was  in  contradiction  with  the  current 
interpretation  of  the  medieval  boards  which  in  both  English  and 
French  refer  to  a  board  game  to  later  be  called  ‘backgammon’  in 
England,  ’trictract’  in  France,  ‘pouf  in  Germany. 


Van  der  Stoep  in  the  magazines  Dammen  and  Hoofdlijn 
presented  a  theory  that  12-piece  alquerque  knew  a  promotion  in 
the  Spanish  alquerque  12  game  whereby  there  would  be  a  game 
of  ‘draughts’.  This  is  an  argument  that  both  Mr.  Garzon  and  I 
refute,  since  we  can  read  in  the  chapter  on  alquerque  12  that  in 
1283  the  promotion  was  not  known  in  alquerque.  Otherwise  we 
would  have  been  told  by  Alfonso  X  the  Wise. 


656  EALES,  R  (1985)  The  History  of  a  Game,  London  p.  49  Eales  said: 

“ .  tables  in  the  Middle  Ages  was  not  a  single  game;  Murray  has  identified 

over  twenty- five  variant  games  played  on  the  2x12  backgammon  board,  and 
there  were  probably  more.  Tabula  was  often  coupled  with  chess  in  medieval 
sources  and  so  it  has  very  frequently  been  misunderstood  as  draughts.  There 
is  no  basis  for  this  error  despite  the  fact  that  both  games  were  played  with 
round  flat  counters”.

The  common  term  for  the  game  of  ‘draughts'  (game  with 
promoted  damas  or  king)  was  in  Spain  marro  or  'Marro  de 
punta'.  However,  we  have  to  taken  into  account  that  Marro  was 
a  collective  name  for  some  board  games  and  therefore  it  is 
always  necessary  to  have  ample  proof  in  form  of  documents  to 
determine  exactly  whether  we  have  to  talk  about  a  ‘draughts' 
game  or  some  kind  of  alquerque  game  which  can  be  played  with 
12,  9,  and  3  pieces.  With  this  we  mean  that  the  'joe  marro'  from 
1370  and  'a  marro',  as  we  describe  in  the  chapter  on  Marro, 
cannot  be  a  game  of  ‘draughts',  as  the  coronation,  the  use  of 
the  dama  piece  and  the  use  of  the  name  “ dama ”  in  the  game  of 
Damas  is  posterior  to  this  date.

14  DRAUGHTS  »  CHESS  » 
CHECKERS 


(by  Dr.  Franco  Pratesi) 


14.1  A  logical  path 

As  known,  checkers  is  the  American  word  corresponding  to  the 
English  word  draughts;  here  I  would  like  to  use  both  terms, 
reserving  draughts  for  varieties  which  are  usually  played  on  an 
unchequered  board,  such  as  the  Turkish  variety.  Avigliano 
begins  his  book  with  the  statement  that  checkers  is  certainly  a 
simplified  form  of  chess,  the  only  problem  being  which  of  these 
two  games  is  the  parent  of  the  other.  Similar  ideas  can  be  found 
earlier  and  later.  In  his  work  on  board  games  other  than  chess, 
Murray  concludes  that  both  chess  and  alquerque  were  the 
parents  of  checkers.  In  his  recent  work  on  the  history  of 
draughts  Van  der  Stoep  has  instead  stressed  the  alquerque — 
checkers  relationship,  indicating  that  most  earlier  suggestions  of 
chess  taking  part  in  the  evolution  of  checkers  were  really 
unnecessary.  The  argument  here  is  that  the  evolution  of 
checkers  and  chess  is  closely  connected,  to  the  point  that  chess 
can  be  considered  a  parent  of  checkers  and  vice  versa.  Or,  using 
the  words  as  indicated  above,  draughts  is  a  parent  of  chess  while 
chess  is  a  parent  of  checkers. 

Most  people  learn  chess  and  checkers,  without  realizing  that  the 
games  which  they  have  become  acquainted  with,  exist  in  many 
varieties.  Different  varieties  are  played  in  other  countries,  such 
as  Chinese  and  Japanese  chess.  Thus,  a  review  of  chess — 
checkers  interactions  cannot  be  limited  to  two  single  games,  but 
must  take  account  of  a  number  of  varieties.  For  checkers  several 


-434- 


forms  still  exist,  often  played  at  a  national  level.  In  order  to 
follow  a  logical  path,  going  more  or  less  directly  back — wards 
in  time,  we  can  start  with  the  complex  Canadian  12x12 
checkers,  a  development  of  the  French  10x10  game.  The  origin 
of  this  relatively  recent  game  is  not  very  clear,  even  if 
supposedly  related  to  the  stay  of  the  regiments  of  Meuron  and 
Watteville  (Massicotte)  in  Montreal;  no  surprise  that  older 
varieties  will  be  of  a  still  more  uncertain  origin.  If  Canadian 
checkers  can  be  considered  as  a  curious  and  isolated  variety,  the 
10x10  Dutch — French  variety,  traditionally  known  as  Polish, 
has  gained  the  greatest  international  success  in  the  course  of 
time.  Only  in  this  game  are  now  world  championships  being 
played,  attracting  players  from  several  continents.  Again,  its 
origin  has  been  the  focal  point  of  strong  debates,  particularly 
since  the  reports  of  a  Parisian  origin  of  about  1725  (as  defended 
by  Kruijswijk)  are  in  contradiction  with  the  boards  and  related 
evidence  discovered  in  the  Netherlands  (Van  der  Stoep, 
Bakker). 

In  any  case,  even  the  10x10  Dutch — French  variety  is  not  the 
original  one.  Early  checkers  has  been  played  on  the  8x8 
chequered  chess  board.  Given  that  the  introduction  of  the 
chequered  chess  board  occurred  in  about  the  10th  century,  we 
may  expect  experiments  with  old  board  games  on  this  new 
chess  board,  possibly  leading  to  modifications  of  these  old 
games  since  then.  Even  restricting  to  checkers  varieties  played 
on  the  chequered  chess  board,  it  is  not  easy  to  distinguish  their 
historical  development.  A  first  approach  is  to  divide  the 
checkers  varieties  into  kinds  with  and  without  a  long  move  of 
the  king.  The  assumption  that  the  varieties  with  the  short  leap  of 
the  king  are  the  earliest  seems  plausible.  Thus,  in  our  backward 
path  we  first  encounter  both  the  largely  played  Russian  variety 
and  Spanish  checkers  with  its  wonderful  literature.  The  main 
difference  between  these  two  games  is  that  the  men  in  the 


-435  - 


Russian  variety  can  also  take  in  backward  directions.  In  the 
final  stage  of  our  backward  review,  we  find  the  Italian  and  the 
French  varieties.  It  seems  very  unlikely  and  illogical  that  these 
two  varieties  could  have  been  derived  from  the  previously 
mentioned  forms.  To  people  accustomed  to  a  powerful  long  leap 
of  the  king,  "new"  varieties  with  a  short  king  leap  cannot  have 
been  attractive  at  all.  There  is  a  problem  here,  however.  The 
extant  documentary  evidence  seems  to  show  that  Spanish 
checkers  was  the  first  checkers  played  in  the  Netherlands 
(Bakker).  The  Anglo — French  variety  still  exists  as  British  and 
American  checkers. 

In  the  course  of  time  only  some  laws  of  capturing  may  have 
been  modified.  Italian  checkers  is  often  mentioned  for  its  strict 
capturing  rule,  "II  piu  col  piu”,  the  taking  of  the  most  pieces  by 
the  most  powerful  ones.  There  is  a  consolidated  theory  that 
initially  there  was  full  freedom  as  to  which  pieces  could  be 
taken  by  which  pieces,  and  that  even  taking  itself  was  not 
compulsory  at  first.  Then  taking  became  compulsory,  and 
huffing  was  introduced  as  a  consequence.  From  this  viewpoint, 
Italian  checkers  should  be  one  of  the  younger  versions. 
However,  there  are  some  hints  that  Italian  checkers  may  be 
older.  The  fact  that  an  Italian  checkers  king  is  the  only  king  that 
cannot  be  taken  by  men  seems  to  be  important.  There  is  early 
evidence  for  some  difficulties  in  the  application  of  this  rule,  as 
the  statement  of  Aldrovandi,  near  the  end  of  the  16th  century, 
that  a  king  could  be  taken  when  two  men  aimed  together  to 
capture  him.  In  this  context,  the  English  name  of  the  most 
powerful  piece,  otherwise  rather  difficult  to  explain,  is 
completely  at  home:  of  course  no  common  piece  can  take  a 
chess — like  king)  (What  appeared  as  a  pawn — queen  battle, 
now  becomes  a  queen — king  battle.  The  game  may  also  be 
considered  as  a  pawn — king  battle,  but  in  checkers  the  most 
powerful  piece  resembles  more  a  queen  than  a  king.)  In  chess 


-436- 


the  only  piece  which  cannot  be  taken  is  the  king.  The  only 
checkers — king  which  cannot  be  taken  is  the  king  in  Italian 
checkers.  To  be  the  sole  example  seems  rather  to  be  a  residue  of 
an  older  habit  than  a  new  rule,  introduced  in  a  well-spread 
game.  Thus  the  name  of  the  king  in  English  checkers  and  the 
invulnerability  of  the  king  in  Italian  checkers  seem  to  point  to 
some  original  form.  Even  If  a  direct  correspondence  of  checkers 
and  chess  kings  is  not  accepted,  there  are  further  possible 
hypotheses  for  a  very  old  origin.  For  instance,  the  board  games 
of  the  fox  and  geese  king  also  have  the  rule  that  the  powerful 
fox  cannot  be  taken  by  the  common  geese.  Up  to  now,  only  the 
national  varieties  of  the  Western  European  countries  have  been 
considered. 

Now  we  turn  to  the  Eastern  varieties,  using  the  word  draughts 
for  these  games,  usually  played  on  an  unchequered  board.  In 
this  way  draughts  may  be  older  than  checkers,  since  checkers 
cannot  be  older  than  the  European  chequered  chess  board, 
invented  in  the  10th  century.  Here  we  certainly  encounter  an 
even  greater  lack  of  documents  and  also  a  problem  of  definition. 
The  demarcation  boundary  of  what  can  be  called  draughts  is  not 
very  sharp.  On  the  other  hand,  the  information  preserved  on  the 
rules  of  most  ancient  board  games  is  very  scant;  In  particular, 
the  typical  method  of  capturing  used  in  draughts  has  not  been 
found  in  the  ancient  world,  even  if  the  broad  diffusion  both  in 
Europe  and  Asia  of  games  of  the  fox  and  geese  type  is  hard  to 
explain  without  assuming  an  ancient  origin.  Starting  from 
Armenian  and  Turkish  draughts,  we  may  thus  come  across  some 
board  games  of  the  ancient  civilizations,  played  well  before  the 
introduction  of  chess.  In  this  sense  draughts  may  be  considered 
as  much  older  than  chess.  Thus  chess  may  have  been  a  child  of 
draughts.  In  order  to  understand  this  derivation,  we  have  to 
realize  that  early  chess  was  not  played  like  the  modern  game 
with  its  several  far-reaching  pieces  that  allow  defence  and 


-437- 


attack  at  distance.  In  old  chess,  the  pawns  had  the  forward 
move,  but  always  only  one  square  at  a  time;  the  kings  moves 
just  as  now;  the  viziers  moved  only  one  square  diagonally, 
either  for  moving  or  capturing.  Given  their  quantity  (pawns)  and 
their  power  (kings  and  viziers),  these  pieces  were  the  most 
significant  in  old  chess,  and  these  pieces  all  moved  as  may  have 
been  the  case  in  old  draughts.  It  may  also  be  noted  that  in  most 
abstract  chess  sets  these  three  kinds  of  pieces  are  of  a  simple 
and  almost  identical  shape,  differing  only  in  dimensions.  It  is 
important  to  know  whether  the  other  pieces  of  old  chess,  the 
chariot,  the  elephant  and  the  horse,  originally  had  the  long 
move.  Certainly  the  elephant  arid  the  horse  had  not,  but  it  is 
uncertain  whether  the  chariot,  the  most  powerful  piece  in  old 
chess,  had  the  long  move.  Starting  from  ancient  forms  of 
draughts,  a  sort  of  chess  may  thus  be  obtained  simply  as  a  result 
of  mixing  two  different  games  or  by  experiencing  with  the 
allowed  moves  In  order  to  acquire  a  better  simulation  of  a 
battle. 

It  may  be  noted  that  the  pieces  that  differed  most  from  the 
draughts  pieces,  also  changed  the  most,  except  for  the  horse  of 
course.  Here  the  illustration  of  my  argument  is  reaching  its  end. 
The  family  of  checkers  and  draughts  is  rich  of  varieties  which 
may  be  divided  into  more  ancient  Eastern  and  more  modem 
Western  ones,  The  two  groups  seem  to  belong  to  different 
evolution  stages,  both  In  their  own  history  and  in  relation  to 
chess.  Western  checkers  games  are  played  on  half  the  squares  of 
the  chequered  board  and  consequently  should  be  considered  as 
chess  children  or,  at  least,  if  a  direct  filiation  is  not  agreed  upon, 
as  games  bom  after  the  introduction  of  chequered  boards  for 
chess.  But  Eastern  draughts  games,  including  Armenian  and 
Turkish  draughts,  played  on  an  unchequered  board,  may  be 
considered  as  chess  parents.  Distinguishing  Western  and 
Eastern  varieties  has  thus  proven  to  be  useful.  However,  Eastern 


-438  - 


varieties  are  known  In  the  West  too  such  as  Old  German 
draughts  (Thiele,  Van  der  Stoep)  and  the  varieties  played  in 
Frisia  and  elsewhere  (Van  der  Stoep).  Since  only  the  draughts 
kind  can  antedate  the  chequered  chess  board,  Frisian  draughts 
may  thus  appear  older  than  what  is  known  as  the  Polish  kind. 
However,  the  first  evidence  of  Frisian  draughts  appears  to  be 
contemporary  with  the  first  traces  of  Polish  checkers  (Bakker). 
Connected  with  this  distinction,  chess  may  have  been  an 
intermediate  form  between  draughts  and  checkers,  at  least  in 
some  cases.  Useful  advice  from  Mr  Bakker  and  Mr  Kruijswijk 
is  gratefully  acknowledged.  In  particular,  Mr  Kruijswijk 
indicated  the  works  of  Johnston  and  Limbrey,  in  which  similar 
conclusions  were  reached  almost  a  century  ago  and  which  can 
be  considered  as  supporting  the  validity  of  the  above 
reasoning658.

14.2  Analysis 


This  is  the  whole  article  of  Dr.  Franco  Pratesi's  written  in  1991. 
Quite  interesting  is  the  sentence:  Starting  from  Armenian  and 
Turkish  draughts,  we  may  thus  come  across  some  board  games 
of  the  ancient  civilizations,  played  well  before  the  introduction 
of  chess.  In  this  sense  draughts  may  be  considered  as  much 
older  than  chess. 


The  board  game  historian  Dr.  Arie  van  der  Stoep  from  the 
Netherlands  made  good  use  of  Dr.  Pratesi's  study  and  years  thereafter 
wrote  a  book  defending  this  idea659. 

One  of  the  problems  that  historians  encounter  is  that  many  of 
them  do  not  consider  the  old  alquerque  game  to  be  the  draughts 
game  as  we  know  it  today.  Thus  pawns  or  discs  played  on  a 
checkered  board  and  with  a  long  dame  or  short  king.  But  could 
these  games  not  have  been  played  on  a  linesboard?  The  answer 
is  probably  yes  and  this  makes  it  extremely  difficult  to  make  a 
separation  between  the  old  and  new  draughts  game. 

Another  important  statement  of  Dr.  Pratesi's  is  this  one: 

The  family  of  checkers  and  draughts  is  rich  in  varieties  which 
may  be  divided  into  more  ancient  Eastern  and  more  modern 
Western  ones,  the  two  groups  seem  to  belong  to  different 
evolution  stages,  both  in  their  own  history  and  in  relation  to 
chess. 

This  statement  makes  it  clear  that  there  were  different  evolution 
stages,  both  in  their  own  histories.  That  is  the  reason  why  even 


659  STOEP,  Arie  van  der  (2005)  Draughts  in  relation  to  chess  and  alquerque 


-440- 


in  Europe  we  see  so  many  different  draughts  games  -  because 
the  history  of  each  country  was  different. 

There  is  no  doubt  that  the  evolution  of  the  draughts  game  was 
influenced  by  its  own  history.  On  the  other  hand  there  was  a 
tendency  in  Europe  to  accept  certain  ideas  of  the  Greek  and 
Roman  times  known  as  the  Renaissance,  a  period  in  Europe. 
From  the  14th  to  the  17th  century  we  had  the  Roman 
renaissance.  This  was  a  season  that  goes  from  the  late  1 5th  to 
the  mid  16th  century. 

For  that  reason  it  is  also  important  to  study  the  literature  of  the 
boardgames  in  Roman  times  since  they  could  have  had  a  great 
influence  on  the  evolution  of  the  different  varieties  of  the 
draughts  games. 

Draughts  as  the  parent  of  chess  needs  a  further  explanation.  The 
simple  term  ‘draughts’  is  very  confusing,  because  the  reader 
automatically  thinks  of  the  actual  boardgame  of  draughts  played 
on  a  checkered  board  and  with  a  strong  dame  or  weak  king.  The 
idea  is  obvious,  but  needs  much  more  information  for  the 
reader.  It  is  absolutely  necessary  to  indicate  the  difference 
between  the  two  games  clearly  to  avoid  any  confusion. 

Till  now  most  historians  agree  that  Alquerque-12  was  the 
precursor  of  the  present  draughts.  However,  since  there  was  an 
evolution  in  draughts,  as  adequately  observed  by  Dr.  Pratter,  we 
have  to  clearly  indicate  the  steps  and  way  of  playing,  or 
otherwise  any  boardgame  could  have  been  the  precursor  of 
draughts.

15  THE  FRISIAN  DRAUGHTS 


This  type  of  draughts  game  is  known  as:  aka  "Frysk  damjen" 
(Frisian)  or  "Fries  dammen"  (Dutch)  or  "Frisian  draughts" 
(English) 


15.1  Rules  of  Frisian  draughts 

Frisian  draughts  is  closely  related  to  the  now  standard  game  of 
(Polish)  draughts  and  can  be  traced  back  to  at  least  the  late 
1600s,  when  the  games  of  the  Draughts  Family  were  sweeping 
through  Europe  from  the  French  base.  It  has  retained  its  unique 
rules  ever  since,  and  presently  has  its  own  league,  founded  in 
1932,  and  is  still  widely  played  in  its  natural  home  of  Friesland. 
Friesland  is  (currently)  a  province  with  its  own  language  and 
culture  in  the  north  of  the  Netherlands. 

The  "normal"  version  of  draughts  only  slowly  made  its  way  into 
Friesland,  and  is  known  there  as  "Oer  Hoek"  (over  corners)  or 
"Hollansk  damjen/Hollands  dammen".  These  days  you  are  more 
likely  to  hear  people  talk  about  "Frysk  Damjen"  than  "Oer 
Alles"  (Over  All). 

The  set-up  and  basic  movement  is  identical  to  the  commonly 
known  game,  but  it  won't  be  long  before  the  main  difference 
will  become  very  apparent:  capturing  isn't  restricted  to  just 
diagonal  jumps,  but  can  be  executed  horizontally  and  vertically 
as  well.  Yes,  a  piece  can  capture  in  all  8  directions!  If  you  think 
that  makes  it  easier  to  solve,  try  it.  It  has  a  lot  more  action  but  it 
doesn't  become  easier. 


-442  - 


There  are  other  subtle  variations660: 

A  promoted  King  can  be  moved  only  three  times  in  succession 
when  a  player  still  has  normal  pieces.  After  that  it  must  be 
"released"  by  a  capture  (which  can  be  made  with  the  same  king) 
or  by  moving  another  piece.  When  a  player  has  nothing  but 
Kings  then  this  rule  is  ignored.  When  you  can  capture,  you 
must,  but  if  a  King  and  a  standard  piece  can  both  capture  a 
stone,  or  stones,  of  equal  value,  then  it  is  the  King  that  has  to 
make  the  capture.  When  there  are  multiple  capturing 
opportunities  of  equal  value  than  the  one  that  includes  most 
Kings  must  be  taken.  The  moment  a  player  obtains  a  second 
King  (and  his  opponent  has  only  one),  than  that  player  has 
seven  moves  to  finish  the  match  or  it  automatically  becomes  a 
draw.  Kings  can  make  long  jumps. 


15.2  Age  of  the  game 

Gerard  Bakker  also  dealt  with  the  Frisian  draughts  game  that  he 
described  as  the  “Molkwerums  dammen”  and  the  first  reference 
he  found  to  this  game  was  from  1725.  According  to  him  the 
game  was  not  very  old  and  his  summary  of  the  game  is  as 
follows: 

The  Dutch  game  “Molkwerums  dammen”  of  the  18th  and  19th  century;  the 
Scandinavion  game  “Makvaer”  and  the  French  game  “jeu  de  dames  a  la 
babilonienne”  (also  known  in  England  and  Germany  under  this  name)  of  the 
same  period;  the  Frisin  game  “oer  alles”  (meaning  “en  tout  sens”  in  French 
and  “in  all  directions”  in  English)  of  the  19th  and  20th  century;  and  the  game 
“Fries  Spel”,  at  present  practised  in  the  north-west  part  of  the  Dutch  province 
of  Friesland,  are  one  and  the  same  game  of  draughts.  Its  main  characteristics 


660 


https  ://boardgamegeek.  conVboardgame/22493/frisian-checkers 


-443  - 


ar  the  100-square  board  and  the  power  of  man  and  king  to  make  capltures  in 
eight  directions:  four  digonal,  two  horizontal  and  two  vertical  ones661. 


15.3  Other  names  of  Frisian  draughts 

The  Frisians  are  still  proud  sailors  and  it  should  come  as  no 
surprise  that  there  are  more  pockets  along  the  North  Sea  and 
Baltic  Sea  that  play  the  game,  where  it  is  known  under  many 
names  that  all  refer  to  the  erstwhile  important  Frisian  harbour 
village  of  Molkwar/Molkwerum,  famous  in  Holland  for  its  ad- 
hoc  infrastructure.  Early  Dutch  literature  (mockingly)  refers  to 
Frisian  draughts  with  its  free-form  any-direction  capturing  as 
"Molkwerums  dammen"  as  an  homage  to  the  labyrinthine 
village. 

"Molkwerums  dammen"  (Dutch).  A  similar  game  is  "Makvaer" 
(Danish)  or  "Marquern"  (Swedish),  however,  it  is  played  on  an 
8x8  board  and,  in  Makvaer,  a  King  doesn't  only  move 
diagonally,  but  also  orthogonally,  that  is  in  8  directions. 

And  more  still: 

"Jeu  du  Dame  Bablionique"  (French),  "Babylonian  Draughts" 
(English) 

There  is  even  a  game  played  in  Siberia  that  follows  very  similar 
rules  to  Frisian  Draughts,  except  that  it  is  played  on  a  64  field 
chess  board662.

15.4  FINAL  CONCLUSION 


15.5  The  origin  of  the  game  of  Alquerque-12 

To  establish  a  date  and  place  for  the  beginning  of  Alquerque  12 
is  not  easy.  We  have  seen  that  there  are  some  indications  of  a 
Roman  period  when  we  take  into  account  the  alquerque  12 
boards  found  in  Munigua.  However,  there  is  no  indication  of 
how  the  alquerque  12  board  was  found  in  this  place,  today 
called  Mulva.  Other  researchers  indicate  that  the  board  of 
alquerque  12  found  in  San  Lu  Place  was  from  the  Yisigothic 
period  and  from  the  6th  century.  On  the  other  hand  there  is  an 
alquerque  12  stone  in  the  museum  of  Zamora  that  came  from 
Dehesa  de  Pelazas.  In  the  Middle  Ages  this  place  was  the  court 
of  jurisdiction  of  the  Knights  of  the  Order  of  Santiago  during 
the  reign  of  Ferdinand  II.  Strangely  enough,  most  of  the 
alquerque  12  drawings  are  found  in  the  north  of  Spain,  whereas 
one  would  expect  these  boards  more  in  the  south,  because  up  to 
now  scholars  think  that  alquerque  12  was  of  the  Arabic  origin. 


In  Portugal  the  game  of  Alquerque-12  is  found  on  a  lid  of  a 
sarcophagus  from  the  Roman  Castle  S.  Jorge663.  The  oldest 
parts  of  this  castle  date  from  the  6th  century,  when  it  was 
fortified  by  the  Romans,  Visigoths,  and  eventually  the  Moors.  It 
served  as  a  Moorish  royal  residence.  Portugal's  first  king 
Afonso  Henriques  captured  it  in  1147  with  the  help  of  northern 
European  crusaders  on  their  way  to  the  Holy  Land.

In  Italy  two  exemplars  of  alquerque-12  date  back  to  the  Roman 
period.  They  are  found  on  a  reused  block  of  the  front  of  the 
basilica  of  San  Zeno  in  Verona  and  on  the  cathedral  of 
Cherasco  (Cuneo). 

In  Jerusalem  on  the  long  road  that  ascends  to  the  place  where 
Jesus  Christ  was  crucified  known  as  “Painful  Way”  (“Way  of 
sorrows”  or  “Way  of  the  cross”)  there  is  a  clear  alquerque  12 
drawing  on  one  of  the  slabs  that  form  the  floor  of  the  Roman 
Catholic  “Chapel  of  Condemnation”.  The  chronology  that  can 
be  established  for  this  drawing  would  be  between  the  Roman 
and  the  Medieval  period.  However,  since  the  drawing  is  on  a 
road,  it  is  difficult  to  establish  a  date. 

We  have  to  be  careful  in  considering  all  alquerque  12  drawings 
as  board  games.  There  are  many  vertical  drawings  of  alquerque 
12  that  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  board  game,  since  they  were 
used  for  another  purpose.  In  this  respect  one  can  take  into 
account  the  Knights  Templar  and  their  carvings  at  the  Donjon 
du  Coudray,  Chinon  (France). 

There  is  a  manuscript  between  1250  -  1300  from  the 
Benedictine  Cerne  Monastery  at  Abbey  (Dorsetshire)  in  the 
United  Kingdom  that  shows  the  following  games:  Daldos, 
Alquerque  9,  Alquerque  12,  and  chess. 

The  drawing  on  a  stone  of  the  Basilica  of  Saint  John  in  Ephesus 
seems  to  be  the  oldest  one  in  the  world  of  the  Alquerque  12 
game,  according  to  an  expert  in  Roman  Games. 

In  Turkey  we  have  the  Basilica  of  St.  John  in  Ephesus, 
constructed  by  Justinian  I  in  the  6th  century.  It  stands  over  the 


-446- 


believed  burial  site  of  John  the  Apostle.  It  was  modeled  on  the 
now  lost  Church  of  the  Holy  Apostles  in  Constantinople. 

On  the  walls  and  steps  of  the  Roman  Theatre  of  Bosra  in  Syria 
there  are  engraved  numerous  game  boards,  among  them  an 
Alquerque  12  drawing.  After  the  decline  of  the  Roman  Empire 
Bosra  played  a  significant  role  in  the  history  of  early 
Christianity.  It  was  also  linked  to  the  rise  of  Islam. 

What  we  observe  is  that  Portugal,  Spain,  and  Italy  have  the 
highest  number  of  preserved  alquerque  12  drawings.  We  do  not 
know  the  exact  date  of  the  existence  of  the  alquerque  12  game 
as  this  is  something  for  the  experts  in  Roman  games,  because 
we  doubt  that  the  alquerque  12  was  really  a  Roman  game  as 
some  researchers  think.  The  alquerque  12  game  in  various 
countries  always  had  to  do  with  Christians  and  the  church.  It 
was  probably  played  by  the  Church  authorities,  European 
crusaders,  Knight  Templars,  Knights  of  the  Order  of  Santiago, 
and  other  soldiers.  For  that  reason  our  hypothesis  is  that  the 
game  was  an  invention  of  or  related  to  the  activities  of  the 
Catholic  Church. 

In  this  respect  we  remind  that  the  new  powerful  dama  in  chess 
was  based  on  Isabella  of  Castile.  In  this  case  the  Catholic 
Church  also  arranged  Isabella  of  Castile  to  be  a  representation 
of  the  Virgin  Mary  in  1468664  and  in  1475  we  see  her 
representation  of  the  Virgin  Mary  in  the  new  dama  or  queen665

on  the  chessboard.  Lucena,  the  son  of  the  churchman  and 
protonotary  Juan  Ramirez  de  Lucena  (ambassador  of  the 
Catholic  queen)  worked  in  the  printing  house  of  Antonio  de 
Nebrija  in  Salamanca.  We  see  Lucena’s  knowledge  of  chess  and 
a  new  game  known  today  as  draughts  expressed  in  the  new 
dictionary  of  Antonio  de  Nebrija.  The  same  new  powerful  dama 
changed  andarraya  into  draughts  in  1495 666  and  alquerque  12, 
the  precursor  of  draughts,  was  abandoned.  The  Catholic  Church 
had  a  great  influence  on  the  development  of  these  new  board 
games. 


15.6  The  rules  of  Alquerque-12 

Very  little  is  known  about  the  rules  of  Alquerque  12.  What  we 
know  between  the  13  th  and  the  15  th  century  is  only  fully 
described  in  the  game  book  of  King  Alfonso  X  the  Wise  in 
1283.  The  game  is  played  by  two  players  who  have  12  pawns 
each.  There  was  no  coronation  or  strong  piece  in  the  game, 
because  otherwise  King  Alfonso  would  have  indicated  this  in 
his  book.  After  1283  we  do  not  see  the  rules  in  any  book  or 
manuscript.  We  have  to  wait  until  1544  when  we  see  a 
description  of  the  game  in  the  book  of  Celio  Calcagninus  .

As  we  know,  Celio  Calcagninus  started  working  in  Ferrara  in 
1506,  precisely  at  the  time  of  Francesch  Vicent,  the  author  of  a 
chess  book.  Another  coincidence  is  that  in  the  alquerque  12 
described  by  Calcagini  there  are  two  corporals  in  the  game.  We 
observed  something  similar  in  the  first  draughts  game  in  the 
book  of  Juan  de  Timoneda  of  which  the  first  edition  was 
published  in  1547.  However,  the  texts  in  the  book  of  1547  are 
much  older  and  seem  to  come  from  Francesh  Vicent’s  time.  In 
this  first  draughts  game  we  also  see  that  two  damas  were  used  in 
the  starting  position  of  the  party.  Here  the  matter  is  who  was  the 
first  to  describe  the  new  strong  piece  in  the  game.  Apparently  it 
was  Francesch  Vicent  who  described  the  strong  pieces  (damas) 
in  the  game  of  draughts  in  his  two  manuscripts  of  Perugia  and 
Modena  around  1505.  Calcagnini  described  the  capture  of  an 
opponent’s  piece  and  it  appeared  to  be  in  the  same  manner  as  in 
the  Roman  Ludus  Latronculus.  It  is  logical  to  think  that 
Calcagnini  had  the  change  from  alquerque  12  to  draughts  in 
mind  and  started  using  strong  pieces  in  alquerque  12,  as 
Francesch  Vicent  experimented. 

However,  we  have  to  be  very  careful  with  this  idea,  since  we 
see  a  short  dama  (King)  that  cannot  be  captured  by  pawns  in  the 
Italian  draughts.  The  short  dama  moves  only  on  squares 
forwards  or  backwards  and  its  action  is  disastrous  for  the 
opponent.  So  the  possibility  exists  that  alquerque  12  from  the 
beginning  the  16th  century,  transferred  to  a  chessboard 
(andarraya?)  became  two  weak  damas  or  corporals  in  the  game 
with  the  same  movement  as  has  the  dama  in  today’s  Italian 
draughts.  Nevertheless,  it  is  clear  that  for  such  a  statement  we 
need  documentary  proofs  in  future. 

With  regards  to  chess,  the  composition  150  in  the  book  of 
Lucena  is  not  the  only  composition  in  which  we  see  two  damas. 
In  the  manuscripts  of  Cesena  (position  9-2)  and  Perugia 


-449  - 


(position  11)  made  by  Francesch  Vicent  around  1505  the  white 
begins  the  game  with  two  queens,  as  indicated  by  Garzon668. 
Was  Calcagnini  aware  of  these  facts? 

Thus  we  see  that  at  the  beginning  of  the  16th  century  two 
leaders  or  strong  pieces  were  described  in  Alquerque  12,  chess, 
and  in  draughts. 

Most  draughts  historians  hold  the  opinion  that  before  the  strong 
dama  in  draughts  there  was  a  weak  dama  (King)  or  weak  piece, 
as  was  the  case  in  chess.  Unfortunately  this  is  something  that  we 
cannot  confirm  for  draughts  since  the  literature  does  not  offer 
any  proof  in  this  sense.  Maybe  there  was  a  weak  piece  in 
andarraya  (alquerque  put  on  a  chessboard),  but  even  for  that  we 
do  not  have  any  documentary  proof.  The  expert  in  draughts 
history,  Dr.  Arie  van  der  Stoep  believes  in  a  medieval  draughts 
game  with  promotion669. 

It  is  rather  strange  to  observe  that  there  is  no  mention  of  the 
rules  of  alquerque  12  in  the  literature  of  1300  -  1500.  Thanks  to 
the  research  of  Dr.  Francesco  Pratesi,  a  famous  tarot  ad  go 
researcher,  we  gained  possession  of  his  study  about  Celio 
Calcagnini  who  wrote  extensively  about  Alquerque  12  in  Latin. 
Hopefully  after  the  publication  of  this  book  we  will  obtain  more 
ancient  studies  about  alquerque  12  from  other  researchers  in  the 
near  future,  because  there  still  remain  gaps  about  the  rules  of 
this  game.
