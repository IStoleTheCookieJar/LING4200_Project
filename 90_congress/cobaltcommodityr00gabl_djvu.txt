A  COBALT  COMMODITY  RECYCLING  FLOW  MODEL 

By  Robert  C.  Gabler,  Jr.,1  and  William  D.  Riley2 


ABSTRACT 

World  resources  of  cobalt  appear  ample  for  the  foreseeable  future;  however,  political  and  economic 
events  have  caused  concern  over  the  availability  and  reliability  of  an  uninterrupted  supply.  Because  of 
this  concern,  the  U.S.  Congress  requested  that  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Mines  initiate  a  study  of  the  flow  of 
cobalt  in  the  economy  that  would  delineate  and  quantify  the  production  areas  where  metal  values  are 
lost.  As  a  result,  the  Bureau  has  developed  a  computerized  commodity  flow  model.  A  major  attribute 
of  this  model  is  that  it  is  amenable  to  updating  as  supply,  demand,  and/or  production  data  change.  This 
report  follows  the  flow  of  cobalt  through  its  metallurgical  and  chemical  applications  and  highlights  areas 
where  significant  losses  occur  due  to  downgrading,  export,  or  disposal.  The  study  indicates  that  about 
4,300,000  lb  of  cobalt-bearing  materials  are  lost  each  year,  representing  24  pet  of  U.S.  domestic  demand.

INTRODUCTION 


Cobalt  is  an  indispensable  element  in  a  variety  of 
critical  and  strategic  applications  such  as  superalloys, 
permanent  magnets,  cemented  carbides,  alloy  and  tool 
steels,  catalysts,  and  chemicals.  Cobalt  has  few  viable 
substitutes  in  most  of  its  major  end  uses.  The  United 
States  currently  is  entirely  dependent  on  foreign  sources 
for  its  primary  cobalt  demands.  Although  world  resources 
of  cobalt  are  ample  for  the  foreseeable  future,  political 
and  economic  events  have  raised  doubts  about  the 
uninterrupted  availability  and  reliability  of  supplies  of 
this  commodity.  The  largest  suppliers  of  cobalt  are  the 
central  Africa  countries  of  Zaire  and,  to  a  lesser  extent, 
Zambia.  The  risks  of  future  disruptions  from  these 
sources  are  high  (I).3 

Various  literature  studies  have  reported  the  strategic 
importance  of  a  number  of  commodities,  their  availability, 
and  their  vulnerability  to  interrupted  supplies  (1-8).  Most 
of  these  studies  either  are  out  of  date  or  do  not  supply 
information  on  losses  of  the  strategic  and  critical  com- 
modities due  to  waste  disposal,  downgrading,  and/or 
export. 

Industry  officials  in  the  production,  manufacturing,  and 
recycling  of  strategic  and  critical  commodities  are  reluctant 
to  discuss  the  quantities  of  scrap  that  go  to  disposal, 
downgrading,  and  export.  This  information  is  often  con- 
sidered to  be  proprietary  in  nature. 

Even  when  data  are  available,  there  is  confusion 
between  disposition  of  materials  and  recycling.  For  ex- 
ample, in  a  survey  of  seven  scrap  recyclers  in  1987  (9),  the 
following  estimates  were  obtained  for  disposition  of  scrap 
from  the  superalloy  industry: 

Range,  pet 

Domestic  recycling 60-100 

Exports    0-40 

Of  recycled  scrap: 

Domestic  remelting 75-100 

Recycling  to  same  superalloy 38-90 

Recycling  to  other  high-value  superalloy  .  5-  38 

Downgrading 10-25 

Discarding 3-  5 

These  estimates  are  typical  of  the  data  on  processing, 
manufacturing,  disposal,  downgrading,  and  recycling  of 
strategic  and  critical  materials.  Therein  lies  the  difficulty 
in   determining   the   amounts   of  critical   and   strategic

preceding  the  appendix  at  the  end  of  this  report. 


commodities  that  are  discarded,  downgraded,  or  exported, 
which  is  the  reason  for  conducting  this  study. 

In  1980,  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Mines  reported  the  results 
of  contracted  studies  by  Inco  Research  and  Development 
Center,  Suffern,  NY,  and  Arthur  D.  Little,  Inc.,  Cam- 
bridge, MA,  to  assess  the  domestic  availability  of  chro- 
mium in  scrap  and  the  amount  that  was  recycled  (10-11). 
These  reports  contain  data  up  to  1976  and  1978,  respec- 
tively; no  updates  of  these  studies  were  conducted  follow- 
ing their  publication.  In  1983,  the  National  Materials 
Advisory  Board  (NMAB)  published  a  study  of  the  flow  of 
cobalt  in  all  end  uses,  which  discussed  the  amounts  of 
downgraded  scrap  and  waste  produced  by  the  cobalt  in- 
dustry (1).  The  report  also  discussed  the  need  for  im- 
proved recycling  of  cobalt-containing  scrap. 

In  May  1985,  the  U.S.  Congress,  Office  of  Technology 
Assessment  (OTA)  produced  a  study  entitled  "Strategic 
Materials:  Technologies  To  Reduce  U.  S.  Import  Vulner- 
ability" (12).  Included  in  the  study  were  a  set  of  recom- 
mendations to  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Mines  to  conduct  a 
survey  of  recycling-related  activities.  OTA  recommended 
a  scrap  recycling  study  to  update  the  chromium  scrap 
metal  information  contained  in  two  Bureau  publications 
(10-11),  as  well  as  to  expand  the  scope  of  the  previous 
studies  to  include  information  on  scrap  generated  by 
cobalt,  manganese,  and  the  platinum-group  metals 
industries,  as  well  as  the  wastes  generated  by  all  the 
various  industrial  and  Department  of  Defense  (DOD) 
users  of  these  four  commodities. 

In  1987,  the  Bureau  initiated  this  study  of  the  four  com- 
modities. The  main  objective  of  the  study  is  to  produce 
a  commodity-orientated  structural  model  tracing  flow,  re- 
cycling, and  final  disposition  of  the  four  identified  com- 
modities, which  can  be  updated  in  subsequent  years.  A 
second  objective  of  the  study  is  to  provide,  in  an  under- 
standable manner,  an  overview  of  the  commodity  flow  that 
can  be  used  by  Congress  and  industry  associations  as  a 
tool  to  help  in  the  study  of  that  commodity's  vulnerability 
to  political  and  availability  factors  outside  the  control  of 
the  United  States.  Another  objective  of  the  study  is  to 
highlight  significant  commodity  loss  areas  where  further 
research  is  required.  This  will  enable  the  development  of 
specific  project  proposals  to  address  specific  recycling 
areas. 

To  meet  the  preceding  objectives  of  the  study,  a 
hierarchical  model  was  developed  for  cobalt,  and  the  data 
for  cobalt  are  presented  here.  This  report  consists  of  a 
general  description  of  the  model  and  its  components.  This 
particular  model  is  a  generic  model  that  can  be  applied  to 
other  strategic  and  critical  commodities. 


GENERAL  DESCRIPTION 


The  cobalt  commodity  flow  model  is  composed  of  a  hi- 
erarchical structure  and  a  materials  balance  for  each 
component  of  the  hierarchy.  An  overview  of  the 
commodity  flow  model  is  shown  in  figure  1.  The  model 
structure  provides  a  means  of  organizing  the  overall 
industry  data  and  of  estimating  material  flow  and  waste 
generation  by  subcomponents  of  the  industry.  The  entire 
commodity  industry  is  represented  in  the  first  level  of  the 
structure,  with  subsequent  consumers  in  the  lower  levels  of 
the  structure.  This  hierarchical  structure  lends  itself  to  a 
coding  system  for  identifying  the  industries  and  their 
relationships.  The  cobalt  industry,  for  example,  splits  into 
eight  industries  at  the  highest  level:  superalloys;  magnetic 
alloys;  cemented  carbides;4  tool  steels;  stainless  steels, 
heat-resistant  steels,  and  other  alloys;  miscellaneous  and 
unspecified  industries;  cobalt  catalysts;  and  other 
chemicals.  The  first  level  of  industry  components  would 
thus  be  coded:  Co.l  for  superalloys,  Co.2  for  magnetic 
alloys,  Co.3  for  cemented  carbides,  etc.  Under  cobalt 
superalloy  processing  would  be  cobalt  parts  manufacturing: 
Co.1.1.  A  new  digit  is  added  for  each  descending  level  in 
the  hierarchy.  For  example,  the  end-use  industries  for 
cobalt  superalloys  would  be  Co.1.1.1— jet  engine  turbine 
blades,  Co.l.l.2-compression  rings,  etc. 

With  adequate  input  data,  this  system  permits  one  to 
simply,  quickly,  and  unambiguously  identify  the 
subcomponents  of  any  component  of  the  cobalt  indus- 
try. The  system  permits  the  identification  of  cobalt 
consumption  or  waste  by  industry  component  simply  by 
adding  all  waste  (or  consumption)  for  the  subcomponents. 
To  list  all  the  waste  by  the  cobalt  catalyst  industry,  for 
example,  one  simply  adds  the  waste  for  all  components 
whose  labels  start  with  "Co.7."  If  one  wants  to  know  the 
production  of  scrap  and  waste  in  the  cobalt  superalloy 
parts  manufacturing  industry  one  adds  the  scrap  from  all 
components  whose  labels  start  with  "Co.1.1." 

The  data  organized  by  the  hierarchical  structure  include 
material  balances  by  industry.  This  system  permits 
"upward"  and  "downward"  calculation  of  consumption  and 
waste  quantities.  That  is,  using  this  structure,  one  can 
distribute  domestic  consumption  of  cobalt  over  the 
numerous  industries  that  consume  cobalt.  This  is  "down- 
ward" calculation.  One  could  also  start  by  calculating 
consumption  for  the  lowest  components  and  add  to  get 
total  domestic  consumption.  This  is  "upward"  calculation. 
Using  both  upward  and  downward  calculation  provides  a 
method  for  checking  self-consistency.  Using  upward  and 
downward  calculation  also  permits  the  estimation  of  limits 
on  data  that  is  not  otherwise  attainable.  For  example,  if 
85  pet  of  the  companies  in  an  industry  report  data  and  the 


4Cemented  carbides  are  cutting  tools  and  wear-resistant  materials 
such  as  dies. 


total  consumption  in  this  industry  is  known,  then  the 
estimates  of  the  contributions  of  the  other  15  pet  of  the 
companies  can  be  calculated  by  difference. 

Minimally,  for  the  purpose  of  identifying  scrap  and 
waste  generation  sources,  recycling  routes,  and  potential 
recycling  opportunities,  each  component  should  have  a 
quantified  cobalt  input  and  output,  in  contained  weight  and 
in  gross  weight  by  material.  The  difference  between  input 
and  output  is  identified  waste.  One  can  balance  input  and 
output  in  contained  cobalt  units  to  determine  whether  un- 
identified waste  streams  are  significant

Each  industry  material  balance  is  the  result  of  material 
balances  for  individual  processes.  For  example,  in  the  pro- 
duction of  superalloys,  a  detailed  materials  balance  should 
be  produced  for  each  superalloy  production  operation.  It 
is  likely  that  each  company  has  a  different  furnace,  uses  a 
different  melting  procedure,  produces  to  different  chemical 
specifications,  recycles  differently,  and  has  different 
economic  restrictions.  All  of  these  factors  affect  the 
fraction  of  input  materials  that  reports  to  output  product, 
recyclable  material,  or  waste.  It  is  at  this  level  that 
information  on  recycling  potential  is  most  valuable.  It  is 
at  this  level  that  individual  waste  streams  and  scrap  that 
leave  the  production  process  are  identified  and  char- 
acterized (quantity,  concentration,  contamination,  etc.), 
and  that  unidentified  waste  is  quantified. 

With  the  hierarchical  structure  of  the  industry,  the 
input-output  materials  balance  for  each  component,  and 
the  detailed  materials  balance  for  each  process  that  makes 
up  an  industry  component,  a  "blueprint"  for  commodity 


data  collection  and  organization  has  been  developed.  The 
base  of  this  system  is  the  process  material  balance.  The 
process  material  balances  are  then  aggregated  to  form  the 
industry  material  balance.  The  industry  components  are 
organized  by  the  hierarchical  structure,  which  identifies 
material  flows  among  industry  components. 

The  model  developed  here  for  the  study  of  scrap  and 
waste  generated  by  cobalt  processing  and  consuming  in- 
dustries is  a  blueprint  or  guideline  for  organizing  a  logi- 
cal study  of  cobalt  flow.  The  waste  and  scrap  generated 
through  the  use  of  cobalt  materials  is  identified  through 
application  of  the  material  balance  concept.  This  model 
divides  the  cobalt  industry  into  smaller  parts,  which  should 
make  data  collection  and  analysis  as  well  as  data  revision 
more  manageable.  Problems  may  arise  in  application  of 
this  model;  for  example,  some  companies  may  be  reluctant 
to  provide  data.  But  the  model  is  general  and  flexible 
enough  to  be  adapted  to  these  problems. 


INDUSTRY  FLOW  MODELS 


Neither  the  reported  consumption  nor  the  apparent 
consumption  of  cobalt  in  any  given  year  necessarily  equals 
the  actual  consumption  of  cobalt  in  that  year.  "Reported 
consumption"  is  those  data  reported  to  the  U.S.  Bureau  of 
Mines  in  response  to  the  Bureau's  industry  consumption 
survey  questionnaires.  The  "apparent  consumption"  equals 
primary  production  plus  production  from  old  scrap  plus 
(imports  minus  exports)  plus  (beginning  inventories  minus 
ending  inventories).  Apparent  consumption  is  closer  to 
actual  consumption,  but  reported  consumption  provides  a 
breakdown  by  end  use 

In  developing  the  overall  cobalt  flow  models,  the 
following  guidelines  were  used: 

1.  The  difference  between  reported  consumption  and 
apparent  consumption  was  prorated  among  the  various 
level  2  industry  components,  because  there  are  insufficient 
data  to  determine  where  the  difference  belongs; 

2.  It  was  assumed  that  the  amount  of  cobalt  in  each  of 
the  level  2  industry  flows  that  reported  to  loss,  downgrade, 
prompt  scrap,  flow  to  manufacturing,  and  flow  to  final 
product  was  proportional  to  the  1980  data  reported  by 
NMAB  (1)  and  that  this  proportionment  is  still  valid  at 
this  time; 

3.  The  portions  of  loss  and  downgraded  material 
for  most  of  the  metals  that  appear  as  solid  scrap,  mixed 
scrap,  turnings,  grindings,  and  waste  were  assumed  to 
be  proportioned  as  reported  by  Curwick,  Petersen,  and 
Makar  (11). 

The  cobalt  industry  comsumption  data  for  1987  are  shown 
in  table  1.

SUPERALLOYS 

The  flow  of  cobalt  in  the  superalloy  industry  is  shown 
in  figure  2.  Quantities  were  generated  by  the  model,  using 
the  following  assumptions: 

1.  The  reported  amount  of  cobalt  contained  in  recycled 
obsolete  scrap  (13)  is  proportioned  only  to  superalloy  and 
cemented  carbides  processing. 


2.  The  amount  of  cobalt  from  obsolete  scrap  used  in 
cemented  carbides  is  proportional  to  the  ratio  of  obsolete 
scrap  cobalt  input  to  cemented  carbides  to  total  cobalt 
input  to  cemented  carbides  shown  by  NMAB  (500  units  of 
cobalt  in  obsolete  scrap  per  1,344  units  of  total  cobalt 
input)  (2). 

3.  The  input  of  cobalt  in  obsolete  scrap  to  superalloy 
production  is  the  difference  between  contained  cobalt  in 
total  consumed  obsolete  scrap  and  contained  cobalt  in  ob- 
solete scrap  consumed  in  production  of  cemented  carbides. 

4.  The  difference  between  total  apparent  consumption 
of  cobalt  in  superalloy  production  and  that  part  from  obso- 
lete scrap  is  primary  cobalt. 

5.  The  ratio  of  primary  cobalt  consumed  in  wrought 
products  to  that  consumed  in  cast  products  is  2.0  (2). 

The  composite  flow  of  superalloys  in  the  manufacture 
of  parts  is  the  sum  of  two  independent  flows,  which  are  the 
production  of  wrought  alloy  parts  and  cast  parts  (fig.  2).

In  the  superalloy  industry  there  are  two  types  of 
processing:  In  the  first,  metal  is  processed  to  an  alloy  and 
this  material,  in  the  form  of  a  billet  or  ingot,  then  goes 
to  producing  a  manufactured  part  (wrought).  In  the  sec- 
ond, the  alloy  is  prepared  by  the  melting  of  pure  metals 
by  the  parts  manufacturer  immediately  prior  to  casting  the 
parts  (cast).  To  simplify  the  model,  these  two  different 
operations  are  summed  up  as  a  composite  flow  sequence 
of  superalloy  processing  and  parts  manufacturing. 

From  the  model,  the  following  figures  were  generated. 
In  1987,  the  superalloy  industry  consumed  materials  esti- 
mated to  contain  7,403,000  lb  of  cobalt,  generated  waste 
material  estimated  to  contain  565,000  lb  of  cobalt,  and 
downgraded  material  estimated  to  contain  2,707,000  lb 
of  cobalt.  The  distribution  of  this  material  is  shown  in 
table  2.  In  many  cases  the  loss  to  downgrade  is  due  to 
the  fact  that  specifications  for  certain  end-use  products 
require  the  use  of  virgin  metal  to  produce  the  alloys. 
These  requirements  cause  large  amounts  of  scrap  material 
to  be  used  as  a  cobalt  source  for  alloys  with  lower 
concentrations  of  cobalt  and  lower  economic  values 
(downgraded.)

MAGNETIC  ALLOYS 

The  manufacture  of  magnets  involves  two  major 
processes,  wrought  alloy  processing  and  casting.  The  flows 
of  cobalt  in  the  manufacture  of  magnets  with  wrought  and 
cast  alloys  are  shown  in  figure  3.  The  composite  flows  of 
cobalt  in  all  magnet  manufacturing  are  also  shown  in 
figure  3.  The  flows  were  estimated  based  on  the  data  of 
Curwick,  Petersen,  and  Makar  (11)  and  NMAB  (1).  An 
estimated  2,029,000  lb  of  cobalt  was  used  in  magnet 
manufacture  in  1987.  Of  this  amount,  an  estimated 
141,000  lb  of  cobalt  reported  to  waste,  79,000  lb  of  cobalt 
to  downgrade,  and  1,808,000  lb  of  cobalt  to  magnets.  The 
distribution  of  waste  and  downgraded  materials  is  shown 
in  table  3.  NMAB  states  that  essentially  no  obsolete 
cobalt  magnet  scrap  was  recycled  to  the  production  of 
cobalt-containing  products  (7).

CEMENTED  CARBIDES 

This  category  consists  of  cutting  tools  and  wear-resistant 
materials  such  as  dies.  The  flow  of  cobalt  in  this  industry 
is  based  on  NMAB  data  (1)  and  is  shown  in  figure  4.  The 
material  first  goes  through  powder  processing,  where  the 
only  reported  loss  occurs.  Then,  the  material  goes  to  parts 
manufacturing.  About  3  to  25  pet  cobalt  is  used  as  a 
matrix-cement  for  carbide  cutting  tools,  and  about  6  to 
25  pet  cobalt  is  used  in  carbide  drawing  dies  (1).  In  the 
overall  production  of  cemented  carbide  inserts  and  parts, 
obsolete  scrap  containing  an  estimated  516,000  lb  of  cobalt 
and  870,000  lb  of  primary  cobalt  were  used,  producing 
waste  containing  an  estimated  23,000  lb  of  cobalt  and  parts 
and  inserts  containing  an  estimated  1,363,000  lb  of  cobalt.

TOOL  STEELS 

The  primary  use  for  this  product  is  in  high-speed  tools. 
Cobalt  is  added  to  tungsten-chromium  hot-work  tool  steels 
to  increase  the  toughness  and  strength  of  the  alloy  at  high 
temperatures  (14).  The  flows  of  cobalt  in  this  industry 
are  based  on  NMAB  data  (1)  and  are  shown  in  figure  5. 
In  this  industry  an  estimated  452,000  lb  of  cobalt  is  used 
to  produce  high-speed  tools  containing  an  estimated 
371,000  lb  of  cobalt.  The  production  and  manufacturing 
losses  of  waste  are  estimated  to  contain  81,000  lb  of  cobalt. 

STAINLESS  STEELS,  HEAT-RESISTANT  STEELS, 

AND  OTHER  ALLOYS  (EXCLUDING  ALLOY 

STEELS  AND  SUPERALLOYS) 

The  primary  end  use  of  products  of  this  industry  is  in 
applications  where  heat  and  corrosion  resistance  are  re- 
quired (75).  The  flows  of  cobalt  in  this  industry  are  shown 
in  figure  6.  A  total  of  208,000  lb  of  contained  cobalt  was 
estimated  to  go  into  production  of  the  final  products.  Of 
this,  178,000  lb  was  primary  cobalt  and  the  remainder  was 
prompt  scrap  containing  30,000  lb  of  cobalt.  During  pro- 
duction operations,  an  estimated  12,000  lb  of  contained 
cobalt  reported  as  waste  and  39,000  lb  of  contained  cobalt 
reported  as  downgraded  scrap.  Using  the  data  of  Curwick, 
Petersen,  and  Makar  (11),  the  downgraded  material  is  esti- 
mated to  break  down  into  solid  scrap,  mixed  scrap,  and 
grindings  as  shown  in  table  4.  The  final  products  were 
estimated  to  contain  128,000  lb  of  cobalt.  NMAB  reports 
that  essentially  no  obsolete  cobalt-containing  scrap  is  used 
by  this  industry.

MISCELLANEOUS  AND  UNSPECIFIED  USES 

This  series  of  end-use  industries  produces  the  following 
products:  welding  materials  for  structural  and  hardfacing 
applications,  high-strength  low-alloy  steels,  full  alloy  steels, 
nonferrous  alloys,  mill  products  made  from  metal  powder, 
and  other  unspecified  uses.  Individual  data  are  withheld 
by  the  Bureau  to  avoid  disclosing  company  proprietary 
data.  Information  in  the  1979  to  1984  Minerals  Year- 
books (16)  indicates  that  an  average  of  82  pet  of  the  cur- 
rently designated  miscellaneous  and  unspecified  materials 
were  known  to  be  metal  alloys.  Thus,  a  metallurgical  flow 
model  used  by  NMAB  (7)  was  used  as  a  blueprint  for  this 
portion  of  the  cobalt  industry.  The  data  are  shown  in  fig- 
ure 7.  NMAB  states  that  essentially  no  obsolete  cobalt- 
containing  scrap  is  used  to  produce  these  products  (7). 
An  estimated  1,042,000  lb  of  primary  cobalt  was  used  by 
these  industries  in  1987.  From  this  input,  the  processing 
and  manufacturing  parts  of  the  industries  were  estimated 
to  produce  final  products  containing  747,000  lb  of  cobalt. 
During  the  processing  and  manufacturing  operations,  waste 
material  containing  69,000  lb  of  cobalt  and  downgraded 
scrap  containing  227,000  lb  of  cobalt  were  generated. 
Estimates,  based  on  the  data  of  Curwick,  Petersen,  and 
Makar  (11),  show  that  the  downgraded  scrap  can  be 
broken  down  into  solids,  mixed  scrap,  and  grindings  as 
shown  in  table  5.

CATALYSTS 

A  major  use  of  cobalt  in  chemical  products  is  as  cata- 
lysts. The  catalysts  are  used  for  hydrogenation,  hydration, 
desulfurization,  oxidation,  reduction,  and  synthesis  of  hy- 
drocarbons (14-16).  The  flows  of  cobalt  in  the  catalyst 
industry  are  shown  in  figure  8.  The  amounts  in  the  flow- 
chart are  estimated  using  data  from  NMAB  (1).  In  1987, 
an  input  of  materials  containing  an  estimated  1,294,000  lb 
of  cobalt  produced  catalysts  containing  an  estimated 
1,218,000  lb  of  cobalt.  Process  and  manufacturing  waste 
materials  contained  an  estimated  76,000  lb  of  cobalt. 
Some  of  these  catalysts  can  be  regenerated  several  times, 
but  ultimately  the  fate  of  most  is  disposal  or  metal 
recovery.  The  Bureau  has  developed  technology  to  recover 
cobalt  from  the  spent  catalysts  (17),  and  there  is  currently 
some  reported  use  of  recycling  technology  by  industry. 
Deering  reports  that  between  500,000  and  1,000,000  lb  of 
cobalt  is  recovered  from  spent  catalysts  annually  (18) . 
This  recycling  activity  would  lead  to  an  estimated  disposal 
of  spent  catalysts  containing  in  the  range  of  218,000  to 
718,000  lb  of  cobalt  per  year. 

OTHER  CHEMICALS 

This  industry  produces  chemicals  in  the  form  of  paint 
driers  for  lacquers,  enamels  and  varnishes;  feed  additives;

frits  to  improve  the  adherence  of  porcelain  enamels  to 
sheet  metal;  pigments  in  colors  of  violet,  blue,  green,  and 
pink;  and  salts  (14).  The  flows  of  cobalt  in  this  industry 
are  shown  in  figure  9.  Chemical  processing  efficiency  is 
about  97  pet,  and  chemical  manufacturing  efficiency  is 
somewhat  lower,  about  95  pet  (1).  These  values  were  used 
in  defining  flows  within  this  industry.  The  model  estimates 
that  the  industry  used  about  4,040,000  lb  of  primary  co- 
balt in  1987.  This  reports  as  waste  material  contain- 
ing 317,000  lb  of  cobalt  and  final  products  containing 
3,723,000  lb  of  cobalt.  The  model's  estimated  distribution 
of  cobalt  among  these  products  based  on  reported  con- 
sumption is  shown  in  table  6.  About  two-thirds  of  the 
products  are  paint  driers.

COBALT  MATERIAL  FLOWS 

The  overall  flows  of  cobalt  in  the  industries  using  co- 
balt are  shown  in  figure  10.  In  the  chemical  portion  of 
the  flowchart,  in  1987,  the  industries  consumed  an  esti- 
mated 5,334,000  lb  of  cobalt.  During  processing  and  man- 
ufacturing operations,  materials  containing  an  estimated 
393,000  lb  of  cobalt  were  lost  as  waste.  The  final  products 
contain  an  estimated  4,941,000  lb  of  cobalt.  Approximately 
two-thirds  of  this  material  is  used  in  dissipative  end  uses 
where  recovery  and  recycling  do  not  occur.  Some  metal 
recovery  from  catalysts  has  been  reported  by  Deering  (18). 
In  the  metallurgical  portion  of  the  flowchart,  in  1987,  the 
industries  consumed  obsolete  scrap  containing  an  esti- 
mated 2,510,000  lb  of  cobalt,  an  estimated  9,980,000  lb  of 
primary  cobalt,  and  prompt  scrap  containing  an  estimated 
2,243,000  lb  of  cobalt.  During  processing  and  manufactur- 
ing, materials  containing  an  estimated  893,000  lb  of  cobalt 
were  lost  as  waste,  and  scrap  materials  containing  an  esti- 
mated 3,052,000  lb  of  cobalt  were  downgraded  with  signifi- 
cant loss  of  cobalt  values.  The  final  products  contain  an 
estimated  8,547,000  lb  of  cobalt.  Based  on  prior  studies  of 
the  content  of  waste  and  downgraded  scrap  streams  (10), 
the  waste  and  downgraded  scrap  streams  are  divided  as 
shown  in  table  7.  These  losses  and  downgrades  caused  the 
resource  loss  of  about  24  pet  of  the  1987  apparent  con- 
sumption of  cobalt;  the  downgraded  scrap  is  either  melted 
to  other  alloys  in  which  the  cobalt  may  be  lost  or  greatly 
diluted,  or  exported  for  refining  to  recover  nickel  and 
cobalt.  There  is  much  uncertainty  about  the  portion  of 
the  downgraded  and  obsolete  scrap  that  goes  to  export. 
The  U.S.  Bureau  of  Mines  reported  that  403,000  lb  of 
contained  cobalt  was  exported  in  1987  (13).  This  includes 
cast  cobalt  materials,  cobalt  alloys,  waste,  and  scrap. 
Estimates  from  Bureau  of  Census  data  for  1987  reported 
by  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Mines  indicate  the  contained  cobalt 
exported  to  be  about  806,000  lb  (19).  There  do  not  appear 
to  be  valid  figures  for  the  amounts  from  wastes  and  scrap 
in  these  estimates.

SUMMARY 


A  Bureau  commodity  flow  model  was  updated  and 
computerized  for  the  industries  that  consume  cobalt. 
Based  on  available  data,  the  flow  model  follows  cobalt 
through  its  processing  and  manufacturing  industries 
showing  estimated  values  for  material  lost  through 
disposal,  downgrading,  and  dissipation.  The  model  was 
prepared  using  certain  estimates  and  assumptions.  The 
model  has  the  capability  of  easy  updating  as  new  data 
become  available. 

An  industry  flowchart  was  presented  for  each  of  the 
industries  that  consume  cobalt.  The  flow  of  the  entire 
cobalt  commodity  was  also  described  based  on  the  flows  in 
the  individual  industries  (fig.  10).  The  apparent  con- 
sumption of  cobalt  in  1987  was  17,824,000  lb.  The  esti- 
mated amounts  consumed  by  the  various  industries  were 
shown  in  table  1.  The  largest  consumer  was  the  superalloy 
industry,  which  used  material  containing  7,403,000  lb  of 
cobalt  in  its  operations.  This  was  estimated  to  be 
composed  of  obsolete  scrap  containing  1,994,000  lb  of 
cobalt  and  5,409,000  lb  of  primary  cobalt.  This  industry 
was  also  the  largest  producer  of  downgraded  scrap 
and  wastes,  producing  downgraded  scrap  containing 
2,707,000  lb  of  cobalt  and  waste  containing  565,000  lb  of 
cobalt  (table  8).  Other  high  losses  of  cobalt  occurred  in 
the  chemical  industries  and  in  the  miscellaneous  and 


unspecified  areas.  Over  all,  downgraded  scrap  material 
containing  an  estimated  3,052,000  lb  of  cobalt  and  waste 
material  containing  an  estimated  1,284,000  lb  of  cobalt 
were  produced.  In  addition  to  these  amounts,  an  esti- 
mated 3,290,000  lb  of  cobalt  is  consumed  in  dissipative 
chemical  and  catalyst  end  uses. 

Based  on  the  estimated  lifetimes  of  various  metal  pro- 
ducts (2)  and  the  estimated  amounts  of  products  produced 
in  1977  (10  years),  1982  (5  years),  and  1985  (2  years),  in 
1987  there  should  have  been  potentially  recyclable  metal 
products  containing  8,432,000  lb  of  cobalt.  Table  9  shows 
the  distribution  of  these  products,  their  potential  life  span, 
the  amount  of  cobalt  content  potentially  recyclable,  and 
the  amount  estimated  to  have  been  recycled  to  the  same 
alloy  without  downgrading.  About  83  pet  of  obsolete 
superalloy  scrap  and  52  pet  of  the  obsolete  cemented 
carbide  scrap  is  estimated  to  be  recycled.  Overall,  only  an 
estimated  30  pet  of  the  total  obsolete  scrap  was  efficient- 
ly recycled.  Assumptions  are  that  essentially  no  obsolete 
scrap  is  effectively  recycled  from  magnets,  tool  steels, 
stainless  and  heat-resistant  steels,  and  miscellaneous 
and  unspecified  material.  Thus,  there  is  an  estimated 
5,922,000  lb  of  contained  cobalt  in  the  obsolete  scrap  that 
is  not  recycled  to  the  same  or  equal-value  alloy.

CONCLUSIONS 


A  cobalt  commodity  flow  model  has  been  developed. 
The  model  is  set  up  in  a  hierarchical  manner  with  levels 
for  the  various  industries  and  subindustries.  The  mathe- 
matical relationships  in  the  model  are  discussed  in  the 
appendix.  The  model  shows  the  distribution  of  apparent 
1987  consumption  of  17,824,000  lb  of  cobalt  in  eight 
subindustries.  Estimates  in  table  8  show  production  of 
downgraded  scrap  containing  3,052,000  lb  cobalt  and  loss 
or  waste  material  containing  1,284,000  lb  cobalt.  The 
largest  producer  of  scrap  and  waste  is  the  superalloy 
industry,  in  which  scrap  and  waste  produced  during  alloy 
processing  and  parts  manufacturing  contain  5,311,000  lb  of 


cobalt.  Of  this,  2,039,000  lb  of  contained  cobalt  was  in 
prompt  scrap  that  was  reused  by  the  industry.  The  re- 
maining material  containing  3,271,000  lb  cobalt  is  divided 
into  downgraded  scrap  with  2,707,000  lb  of  cobalt  and 
waste  with  565,000  lb  of  cobalt.  These  two  loss  areas  are 
places  where  prime  concern  should  be  addressed  in  studies 
of  recycling.  The  principal  cause  of  the  downgrading  of 
materials  is  that  certain  end  uses  require  virgin  metal,  and 
thus,  any  scrap  is  downgraded  to  production  of  lower  value 
alloys  or  alloys  where  the  cobalt  is  lost  in  processing. 

The  development  of  this  flow  model  has  highlighted 
areas  where  data  are  needed  to  make  the  model  more 


11 


effective.  There  are  few  or  no  current  data  available  on 
the  amounts  of  material  that  report  as  solid  scrap,  mixed 
scrap,  turnings,  grindings,  and  waste.  The  amounts  calcu- 
lated in  this  model  are  based  on  data  from  1980  and  1976. 
In  the  past  outside  contractors  have  gathered  these  data 
(i,  10).   The  Bureau   needs  to  make  changes  in  its  data 


gathering  survey  sheets  to  obtain  the  required  information 
on  a  continuing  basis  so  that  this  model  can  be  kept  up  to 
date.  There  are  some  Environmental  Protection  Agency 
data  that  are  useful  in  determining  the  amounts  of  waste 
and  downgraded  material,  but  even  these  data  have 
substantial  gaps.

where  BBB  =  prompt  scrap  input  to  miscellaneous 
and  unspecified  metal  processing, 

and  1/6    =  ratio  of  prompt  scrap  to  primary  cobalt 

input  to  miscellaneous  and  unspecified 
metal  processing  (7). 

Then      CCC    =  (AAA  +  BBB)  x  0.03/0.7,         (A-39) 

where     CCC    =  metal  processing  waste, 

and  0.03/0.7  =  ratio  of  metal  processing  waste  to  total 
cobalt  input  to  miscellaneous  and  un- 
specified metal  processing  (i). 

Then      DDD    =  (AAA  +  BBB)  x  0.03/0.7,  (A-40) 

where    DDD    =  metal  processing  downgraded  scrap, 

and  0.03/0.7  =  ratio  of  metal  processing  downgraded 
scrap  to  total  cobalt  input  to  mis- 
cellaneous and  unspecified  metal  pro- 
cessing (i).

Then       EEE    =  (AAA  +  BBB)  -  CCC  -  DDD,  (A-41) 

where  EEE  =  metal  to  miscellaneous  and  unspecified 
metal  parts  and  products. 

Then        FFF    =  EEE  x  0.01/0.64,  (A-42) 

where      FFF    =  parts  and  products  manufacturing  waste, 

and  0.01/0.64  =  ratio  of  parts  and  products  manufac- 
turing waste  to  cobalt  input  to  parts 
and  products  manufacturing. 


Then

Then     HHH    =  EEE  -  FFF  -  GGG  -  BBB,         (A-44) 

where  HHH  =  miscellaneous  and  unspecified  parts  and 
products. 

CATALYSTS 

Catalysts  are  produced  in  a  two-phase  operation.  The 
first  is  processing  to  a  metal  form  or  alloy  and  the  second 
the  manufacturing  of  the  catalysts  themselves. 

JJJ  =  III  x  0.05/1.7,  (A-45) 

where        JJJ    =  chemical  production  waste, 

III    =  primary    cobalt    input    to    chemical 
production, 

and  0.05/1.7  =  ratio  of  chemical  production  waste  to 
primary  cobalt  input  to  chemical 
production  (1). 


Then 


KKK  =  III  -  JJJ, 


(A-46) 


where  KKK  =  produced  chemicals  input  to  catalyst 
product  manufacturing. 

Then  LLL  =  KKK  x  0.05/1.65,  (A-47) 

where      LLL    =  catalyst  product  manufacturing  waste, 

and  0.05/1.65  =  ratio  of  catalyst  product  manufacturing 
to  produced  chemicals  input  to  catalyst 
product  manufacturing  (1). 


Then  MMM  =  KKK  -  LLL,  (A-48) 

where  MMM    =  catalyst  products. 

OTHER  CHEMICALS 

This  industry  produces  paint  driers,  feed  and  nutritive 
additives,  glass  decolorizers,  ground  coat  frit,  and  pig- 
ments. Each  product  was  assumed  to  be  produced  by  a 
two-phase  operation.  The  first  phase  is  chemical  produc- 
tion and  the  second  product  manufacturing. 

NNN    =  sum(PPP  +  QQQ  +  RRR  + 

SSS    +  TTT)  x  0.03,  (A-49) 

where     NNN    =  chemical  production  waste, 

PPP    =  primary  cobalt  input  to  paint  driers  (19), 

QQQ    =  primary    cobalt    input    to    feed    and 
nutritive  additives  (19), 

RRR    =  primary  cobalt  input  to  glass  decolor- 
izers (19), 

SSS    =  primary  cobalt  input  to  ground  coat 
frit  (19), 

TTT    =  primary  cobalt  input  to  pigments  (19), 

and  0.03    =  chemical  production  waste  based  on 

97-pct  efficiency  in  chemical  produc- 
tion (7). 

Then     UUU    =  sum(PPP  +  QQQ  +  RRR  + 

SSS  +    TTT)  -  NNN,  (A-50) 

where    UUU    =  produced  chemicals  input  to  chemical 
product  manufacturing. 

Then  VW  =  UUU  x  0.05,  (A-51) 

where     VW    =  chemical  product  manufacturing  waste, 

and  0.05    =  waste  loss  based  on  95-pct  efficiency 

in  chemical    product    manufacturing 
(5-pct  waste  loss)  (1). 


Then  WWW  =  UUU  -  VW, 

where  WWW    =  chemical  products.
