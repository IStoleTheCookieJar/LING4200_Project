Abstract 

This  research  aims  to  investigate  the  role  of  Islamic  banking  on  income  inequality  reduction. 
The  data  of  this  research  spans  from  2010  to  2015  and  investigate  49  Islamic  banks  from  13 
selected  countries.  This  study  employs  Panel  data  EGLS.  To  compare  with  other 
macroeconomic  variable,  this  research  involves  GDP  Per  capita,  and  inflation  as  control 
variable.  The  estimation  result  shows  that  financial  depth  measured  by  total  customer 
deposit  to  GDP  ratio  has  negative  relationship  with  income  inequality.  It  perhaps  occurs 
when  there  is  an  increase  in  income,  customers  prefer  to  save  their  additional  income  in 
Islamic  banks.  As  customers  increase  their  deposits,  Islamic  banks  enlarge  its  financing  on 
the  prospect  entrepreneurs.  These  entrepreneurs,  afterwards,  may  expand  their  business  and 
create  new  jobs.  More  new  jobs  offer  means  more  people  get  stable  income  and  as  a  result 
may  reduce  income  inequality  in  the  society. 


Introduction 

All  countries  around  the  world  deal  with  the  problem  of  income  inequality.  A  report  from  Organization  for 
Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD)  shows  that  in  the  last  30  years  the  disparity  between  the  rich 
and  poor  is  at  its  highest  level  in  majority  of  OECD  countries.  That  is,  the  richest  10%  of  the  population  in  the 
OECD  region  have  9.5  times  higher  income  than  the  poorest  10%.  In  addition,  the  Gini  index  had  raised  by 
about  3  points  from  0.29  (in  the  middle  of  1980)  to  0.32  (between  2011  and  2012). 

Many  literatures  hypothesize  that  financial  development  may  reduce  income  distribution  gap  by 
allowing  low  income  households  to  access  financing  from  banking  sector.  According  to  the  report  from  World 
Bank  (2015),  there  are  around  2  billion  people  (or  38%  of  population)  in  the  world  do  not  get  benefit  from 
financial  services  and  about  73%  of  poor  people  are  unbanked  due  to  unaffordable  cost,  geography  distance,  and 
other  constraints  which  hinders  them  to  open  the  bank  account.  In  other  words,  financial  sector  is  considered  as 
an  exclusive  system  in  a  certain  society.  By  allowing  low  income  group  access  financial  institutions,  they  are 
expected  to  have  better  opportunity  to  attain  education,  hire  more  workers,  or  do  new  business  as  well  as 
improve  their  skills  and  eventually  increase  their  labor  productivity.  The  expectation  of  ultimate  condition  drives 
a  rise  in  the  total  factor  productivity  and  a  s  a  result  promotes  sustainable  economic  development.  In  other 
words,  financial  development  (through  widening  financial  access)  improve  income  distribution  particularly  in 
the  low  level  income  household  and  hence  can  be  a  potential  alternative  policy  to  reduce  poverty  in  transition 
economies  (Cihak  et  al.,  2013). 

In  the  other  hand,  current  study  shows  that  income  gap  distribution  is  caused  by  money  and  debt  created 
by  banking  and  financial  system.  In  this  sense,  Blair  (2010)  critically  reviews  the  role  of  financial  innovation  on 
credit  and  leverage  in  the  creation  of  income  and  wealth  distribution.  Financial  innovation  leads  to  financial 
institution  creating  a  large  amount  of  leverage  to  supply  large  amount  of  lending  and  to  have  large  amount  of 
loans  so  that  the  demand  for  credit  can  be  provided.  As  its  consequences,  there  will  be  too  much  debt  as  well  as 
credit  which  thereby  triggers  asset  bubbles  and  makes  the  economy  faces  high  risk  to  crisis.  Asset  bubbles  are 
the  main  problem  as  the  destructive  effects  on  the  distribution  of  income  and  wealth  as  well  as  the  allocation  of 
capital  in  the  real  economy.  Here,  a  significant  increase  in  asset  prices  could  lead  to  the  delusion  that  the 
financial  sector  forms  value  for  the  whole  economy,  especially  for  those  who  invest  and  trade  in  capital  market. 
At  this  point,  bubbles  are  likely  to  redistribute  income  and  wealth  more  for  those  invests  in  financial  market  and 
hence  the  distribution  of  income  tends  to  be  widened. 

Nowadays,  Islamic  banking  industry  expands  rapidly.  Across  13  selected  countries1,  total  asset  in  49 
Islamic  banks  reach  more  than  US$  12  million  in  2010  and  increase  doubled  (US$  27.4  million)  in  2015.  It 
means  during  5  years  its  total  asset  has  growth  almost  120%.  In  addition,  total  customer  deposits  also

significantly  rise  up  to  145%  from  US$  6.1  million  in  2010  to  US$14.9  million  in  2015.  Considering  this  fact 
and  previous  literature  on  the  relationship  financial  development  and  income  distribution,  this  research  is 
proposed  to  empirically  investigate  the  impact  of  financial  development  in  Islamic  banking  on  income 
distribution. 

To  examine  the  impact  of  banking  on  income  inequality,  there  are  some  indicators  of  banking 
development.  Literatures  of  banking  development  are  fundamentally  explored  under  financial  development 
which  discusses  both  financial  institutions  and  financial  market  development.  Many  empirical  studies  use  private 
credit  to  GDP  as  the  indicator  of  the  whole  financial  development;  however,  the  World  Bank  considers  this 
proxy  is  one  of  financial  depth  measure.  In  other  words,  measures  of  financial  development  in  the  previous 
literatures  do  not  comprehensively  cover  all  indicators.  Seven  and  Coskun  (2016)  even  specifically  address  that 
one  of  the  major  problems  in  the  empirical  research  on  finance  inequality  nexus  is  to  select  main  variable  to 
measure  finance  development.  Therefore,  this  research  applies  banking  development  indicators  of  the  World 
Bank  which  offers  a  4x2  matrix  characteristics  and  indicator  of  financial  development. 

A  group  of  the  World  Bank’s  economists  such  as  Cihak  et  al.  (2013)  develop  a  measure  of 
characteristic  of  financial  system.  This  measure  is  also  functioned  to  assess  the  development  in  the  financial 
sector.  Financial  development  takes  place  when  instruments,  markets  and  intermediaries  in  financial  sector 
facilitate  the  impacts  of  information,  enforcement  and  transaction  costs.  Financial  sector  development,  thus, 
respectively  brings  job  at  offering  the  main  role  of  the  financial  sector  in  the  economy. 

The  financial  sector  is  classified  into  two  sectors  which  are  financial  institution  and  financial  market. 
There  are  four  characteristics  of  financial  system  which  include  financial  depth,  access,  efficiency  and  stability 
whereby  each  characteristic  has  certain  indicator  or  proxy  (Cihak,  2013). 

The  first  characteristic  is  financial  depth.  Financial  depth  is  to  measure  size  of  financial  institution  and 
markets.  Most  of  literature  use  ratio  of  private  credit  to  GDP  as  the  proxy  of  financial  development.  The  reason 
is  due  to  ratio  of  private  credit  can  figure  to  what  extent  private  sector  is  able  to  access  financial  sector  in  order 
to  meet  their  financial  needs.  According  to  World  Bank  in  World  Development  Indicator  (2005),  private  credit 
provided  by  banking  sector  covers  all  credit  to  all  industries  on  a  gross  basis.  In  other  words,  the  private  credit 
does  not  include  credit  issued  by  central  banks,  credit  issued  for  government  and  its  agencies  and  state-owned 
enterprises.  (Seven  and  Coskun,  2016)  further  explain  that  private  credit  to  GDP  can  be  a  financial  development 
indicator  in  developing  countries  where  financing  and  borrowing  becomes  the  main  business  activities  in 
financial  sector.  This  is  due  to  the  stock  market  sill  underdeveloped,  and  in  some  cases  does  not  exist. 

Level  of  the  ratio  of  private  credit  to  GDP  has  two  contradict  implications  to  the  economy.  First,  private 
credit  to  GDP  has  a  significant  effect  to  reduce  income  inequality  as  well  as  poverty.  Second,  a  high  ratio  of 
private  credit  to  GDP  might  cause  banking  crisis  like  what  happened  in  2008  in  8  countries  (Ireland,  Spain, 
Portugal,  Cyprus,  Netherlands,  United  Kingdom,  Switzerland,  and  Luxembourg). 

Another  indicator  is  total  banking  asset  to  GDP  which  also  become  one  of  variable  indicator  of 
financial  depth  in  the  Global  Financial  Development  Database  published  by  World  Bank.  Total  banking  asset  to 
GDP  variable  is  argued  to  have  more  complete  measure  of  size  of  the  financial  sector  due  to  it  covers  both  credit 
to  private  sector  and  credit  to  government  and  bank  asset.  The  data,  however,  is  not  available  in  all  countries, 
thus  only  small  number  of  empirical  research  use  this  variable. 

One  of  the  indicators  financial  market  depths  is  represented  by  both  bond  and  stock  market.  The  most 
widely  used  indicators  are  the  sum  of  stock  market  capitalization  to  GDP  and  the  outstanding  volume  of  private 
debt  securities  to  GDP.  Stock  market  capitalization  to  GDP  is  a  variable  to  represent  size  of  the  stock  market, 
while  the  outstanding  volume  of  private  debt  securities  to  GDP  is  to  represent  size  of  bond  market. 

The  second  characteristic  is  financial  access.  Financial  access  used  to  measure  of  degree  to  which  every 
individual  is  able  to  access  and  do  use  financial  product  and  services.  Recently,  the  issue  of  financial  access  is 
discussed  in  the  area  of  financial  inclusion.  Financial  access  variable  is  commonly  represented  by  number  of 
banks  accounts  per  1,000  adults.  Meanwhile,  a  measure  of  financial  access  on  stock  and  bond  market,  previous 
study  uses  market  concentration;  that  is  greater  level  of  concentration  means  higher  difficulties  to  access  for  new 
comer  as  well  as  small  issuer. 

The  third  characteristics  is  efficiency.  Efficiency  measure  efficiency  on  financial  intermediaries  and 
markets  in  performing  intermediary  function  and  facilitating  transaction.  It  is  a  cost  of  credit  intermediation.  In 
the  literature,  return  on  assets  and  return  on  equity  are  both  common  proxies  used  for  financial  institution,  while 
for  stock  market  usually  use  turnover  ratio.  Turnover  ratio  is  the  ratio  of  annual  turnover  in  the  stock  market  to 
its  capitalization. 

The  fourth  charachteristic  is  stability.  Stability  measure  the  stability  on  financial  institutions  and  markets. 
It  relates  on  how  banks  may  overcome  the  risk  of  creditor  bankruptcy  case  and  other  economic  shock.  The  four 
measure  components  of  financial  development  summarized  into  4x2  matrix  framework  describe  in  Table  1.

There  are  some  empirical  works  using  cross  section  analysis  and  show  that  financial  development  may  help 
to  promote  income  distribution  amongst  the  people.  By  applying  GMM  procedures,  (Elmi  and  Ariani,  2011)  show 
that  financial  development  has  a  significantly  negative  relationship  with  income  inequality  in  the  case  of  Middle 
East  and  the  North  Africa  (MENA)  countries  for  the  period  2004-2008.  It  suggests  that  financial  development  may 
improve  income  distribution.  The  regression  shows  that  an  increase  of  1%  in  financial  development  turns  out  a 
decline  in  income  inequality  by  about  0.13%.  To  accelerate  the  reduction  of  inequality,  the  regression  also  suggests 
increasing  openness  and  schooling  years  (as  a  representation  for  human  capital).  Similar  technique  and  result  are 
also  found  in  29  urban  provinces  in  China  (Liang,  2006),  African  countries  (Batuo,  Guidi,  and  Mlambo,  2010),  59 
province  in  Vietnam  (Chu  and  Le,  2012),  103  province  in  Italy  (Onofrio  and  Murro,  2013). 

In  addition,  some  studies  investigate  single  country  using  time  series  analysis  that  have  been  investigated  and 
find  that  financial  development  contribute  to  reduce  income  inequality.  By  employing  the  long  run  relationship  using 
Auto  Regressive  Distributed  Lag  (ARDL)  and  short  run  relationship  using  Error  Correction  Model  (ECM) 
methodologies,  both  (Shahbaz  and  Islam,  2011)  and  (Shahbaz  et  al.  2015)  take  case  study  in  Pakistan,  meanwhile 
Saitti,  et.al  (2015)  observe  in  Kazakhstan.  Similarly,  (Baligh  and  Piraee,  2013)  employ  Unrestricted  Error  Correction 
Model  (UECM)  to  investigate  financial  income  inequality  nexus  for  the  period  1973  to  2010  in  Iranian  economy. 
Zhang  and  Chen  (2015)  employ  SVAR  analysis  and  observe  the  case  of  China  for  the  period  1978  to  2013. 

In  the  other  hand,  many  empirical  works  argue  that  income  inequality  exists  due  to  the  limited  access  of 
low-income  families  has  a  to  financial  sector.  This  means  that  financial  sector  has  an  important  role  to  reduce 
income  inequality.  Theoretically,  financial  inclusion  is  a  concept  whereby  financial  sector  provides  services 
which  simply  can  be  used  by  customer  and  other  economic  agent  to  do  their  business.  The  basic  financial 
services  include  credit,  savings  mobilization,  risk  management,  and  insurance  (Mohieldin  et  al.  2012).  These 
services  in  the  long  term  are  expected  to  promote  growth  as  well  as  reduce  income  inequality  (Akimov, 
Wijeweera,  and  Dollery,  2006;  Kenourgios  and  Samitas,  2007;  Levine,  2003).  Park  and  Shin  (2015)  in  this 
regard,  address  financial  development  must  be  accompanied  by  financial  inclusion  to  foster  inclusive  growth.  It 


46

is  thus  expected  that  sustainable  growth  and  productivity  will  be  faster  attained  if  all  individual  in  the  society  is 
able  to  access  basic  financial  services,  especially  for  small  medium  enterprises. 

According  to  the  report  from  World  Bank  (2015),  there  are  around  2  billion  people  (or  38%  of 
population)  in  the  world  do  not  benefit  financial  services  and  about  73%  of  poor  people  are  unbanked  due  to 
unaffordable  cost,  geography  distance,  and  other  constraints  which  causes  them  are  not  eligible  to  open  bank 
account.  This  means  that  financial  sector  is  considered  as  an  exclusive  system  in  some  cases  of  certain  society. 
This  issue  later  brings  an  idea  to  put  forward  financial  inclusion  as  a  concept  to  promote  prosperity. 

The  introduction  of  financial  inclusion  in  1990s  to  overcome  these  matters  is  now  broadly  accepted  by 
multinational  organizations  as  well  as  central  banks  around  the  world.  This  legal  acceptance  and  support  is  expected 
to  enhance  the  acceleration  of  financial  sector  to  improve  the  level  of  economic  growth.  Fundamentally,  financial 
inclusion  aims  to  embrace  all  individual  (society)  of  such  country,  particularly  in  developing  countries,  by 
delivering  financial  service  at  affordable  cost.  It  implies  that  better  ability  to  access  financial  services  means  that 
better  opportunity  for  entrepreneur  to  get  new  capital  to  enlarge  their  business.  Bigger  financial  inclusion  is 
expected  to  contribute  to  eradicate  poverty,  economic  growth  and  higher  employment,  greater  agricultural 
production  as  well  as  food  security,  women  empowerment,  better  health  insurance  and  etc. 

Empirical  studies  observed  by  Ayyagari,  Beck,  and  Hoseini  (2013)  and  (Agnello  and  Sousa  2011) 
support  that  the  higher  access  for  the  poor  to  credit  enables  them  to  expand  their  small  business  and  thus  may 
invest  in  education  and  health  care  for  their  child.  This  would  eventually  help  the  poor  to  come  out  of  the 
poverty  and  hence  reduce  the  level  of  income  gap.  Their  research  takes  case  study  in  India. In  short,  the  negative 
relationship  financial  sector  and  income  inequality  can  be  benefitted  as  a  sector  to  reach  inclusive  growth  and  its 
ultimate  goal  is  to  reduce  income  inequality. 

Kumhof  and  Ranciere  (2010)  also  address  that  a  higher  demand  on  loans  from  bottom  group  will  also 
affect  to  a  greater  size  of  financial  industry  to  increase  credit.  The  economy  hence  will  vulnerable  to  economic 
crisis.  As  shown  in  figure  (2.6)  the  U.S.  financial  sector  grew  quickly  during  1981  and  2007.  That  is,  the  ratio  of 
private  credit  (90%)  more  than  two  times  higher  than  GDP  (210%).  The  share  of  financial  sector  in  GDP 
increases  two  times  (from  4  to  8%).  A  significant  rise  on  loans  leads  the  economy  become  more  exposes  to 
crisis.  Many  asserted  that  what  happened  during  financial  crisis  in  2007  was  due  to  excessive  loans. 

Similiarly,  Jauch  and  Watzka  (2015)  empirically  investigates  the  relationship  between  financial 
development  and  income  inequality  across  138  developed  and  developing  countries  during  1960  to  2008.  By 
employing  fixed  effect  panel  data  and  GMM  approach,  they  find  that  financial  development  raises  income 
inequality  within  countries.  This  perhaps  happens  due  to  excessive  finance  that  promote  rent  extraction  which 
eventually  triggers  income  inequalities.  More  specifically,  the  result  shows  that  an  increase  of  credit  by  10% 
triggers  to  an  increase  by  about  0.22  in  the  Gini  coefficient.  By  employing  Auto  Regressive  Distributed  Lag 
(ARDL,  Law  and  Tan  (2009)  find  the  same  result  is  in  the  case  of  Malaysia. 

Research  Method 

The  econometric  model  of  this  research  is  built  to  model  Islamic  banking  and  its  impact  on  income  distribution. 
Linancial  market  indicators  will  be  excluded  in  the  model  due  to  the  research  is  focused  on  the  area  of  Islamic 
banking  development.  Thus,  financial  development  in  this  research  specifically  refers  to  the  development  in  the 
Islamic  banking  sector. 

To  examine  the  relationship  between  Islamic  banks  and  income  distribution,  the  econometric  model  is 
built  as  follows. 


GINIit  =  a  +  p0FINDEVi>t  +  PiGDPCtf  +  (32INFLATIONu  +  Pj  +  £u 

where  GINI  is  the  Gini  coefficient;  LINDEV  denotes  a  vector  of  two  characteristic  of  financial  sectors  which  are 
financial  depth  and  bank  stability.  These  two  financial  variables  are  chosen  due  to  it  has  direct  impact  on  income 
inequality,  while  efficiency  element  is  directly  related  to  the  performance  of  the  banks.  Financial  access  element 
is  excluded  from  the  model  because  no  data  are  available. 

GDPC  represents  the  real  GDP  per  capita,  meanwhile  INFLATION  is  inflation  rate.  Subscripts  i  and  t  are 
index  of  Islamic  bank  i  and  time,  respectively.  In  addition,  econometric  model  above  involves  an  unobservable 
specific  Islamic  bank  effect  p  and  an  error  term  s.  To  compare  the  effect  with  other  variable,  GDPC  and 
INLLATION  are  involved  in  the  model  as  control  variable.  The  selection  of  control  variables  is  based  on  the  most 
widely  variables  treated  as  control  variable.  In  addition,  the  selection  of  variables  as  well  as  proxies  is  based  on  the 
most  widely  available  as  suggested  by  the  World  Bank2.  Table  2  shows  the  measure  of  variables.

To  examine  finance  and  income  inequality  nexus  in  Islamic  banking,  the  model  of  this  research  is  based 
on  a  panel  data  set  covering  Islamic  banking  cross  countries.  The  span  period  cover  2010  to  2015  and  involve  49 
Islamic  banks  from  13  various  countries  as  case  study.  Graph  1  below  shows  Gini  index  from  13  selected 
countries,  i.e.  Bangladesh,  Egypt,  Indonesia,  Iran,  Iraq,  Malaysia,  Pakistan,  the  Philippines,  Qatar,  Senegal, 
Singapore,  and  United  Kingdom.  Here,  Egypt,  Malaysia  and  the  Philippines  are  three  countries  reaching  highest 
Gini  index  in  2012  up  to  around  0.46.  However,  all  countries  are  basically  facing  the  problem  of  high-income 
inequality  as  shown  in  Figure  1.

49  Islamic  banks 

Malaysia  and  Indonesia  are  two  countries  with  has  many  Islamic  banks,  i.e.  12  banks  (Table  3).  Both 
their  people  and  government  support  the  existence  of  Islamic  banks  in  their  economic  activity.  Thus,  this  is 
perhaps  the  reason  why  these  two  countries  have  more  Islamic  banks  compared  to  other  countries.  In  this 
research,  there  are  49  Islamic  banks  to  be  observed.

In  addition,  the  development  of  Islamic  banks  in  13  selected  countries  shows  better  progress  year  to 
year.  This  condition  is  depicted  on  the  growth  of  total  asset  (Graph  2).  Iran,  Malaysia,  Qatar,  Indonesia  and 
Egypt  are  5  countries  which  show  significant  progress  on  accruing  total  assets.  Specifically,  on  average  during 
2010-2015,  total  asset  in  these  five  countries  reach  US$  133.4  million  (Iran),  US$  67.2  million  (Malaysia),  US$ 
22.3  million  (Qatar),  US$  11.7  million  (Indonesia)  and  US$  8.8  million  (Egypt).

Panel  EGLS  results  show  that  FD  or  total  customer  deposit  to  GDP  ratio  has  negative  impact  on  Gini  index. 
Recall  that  financial  depth  is  to  estimate  the  size  of  market  and  financial  institution.  More  specifically,  if  there  is  an 
increase  of  ratio  of  total  customer  deposit  to  GDP  by  1%,  the  Gini  Index  will  decrease  about  0.01%  (Table  5).  This 
condition  might  happen  when  people  experience  an  increase  in  their  income,  however  their  marginal  propensity  to 
save  (MPS)  is  higher  than  their  marginal  propensity  to  consume  (MPC)  or  MPS  >  MPC.  An  increase  of  total  customer 
deposit  will  raise  total  amount  of  financing.  In  this  case,  Islamic  bank  might  distribute  more  financing  to  new 
entrepreneurs  for  business  expansion.  This  condition  can  be  seen  from  Figure  3  and  Figure  4  below  showing  that  there 
is  an  increase  in  total  customer  deposits  contemporaneously  a  rise  in  gross  loan.  An  increase  in  business  activity  hence 
might  create  new  jobs  or  even  higher  level  of  wage  which  then  minimize  income  inequality.

FSii  variable  measured  by  capital  adequacy  ratio  play  insignificant  role  on  income  inequality  reduction. 
This  might  happen  due  to  this  research  only  cover  short  period  and  there  is  only  few  numbers  of  Islamic  banks 
exist.  Thus,  the  market  share  of  Islamic  bank  is  smaller  than  their  counterpart.  In  this  case,  the  negative 
coefficient  of  FS„  variable  probably  signs  that  Islamic  banks  may  have  role  on  income  inequality  reduction  if  the 
study  period  is  longer  (long  term  analysis).  Recent  empirical  works  studied  by  IMF  staff  show  that  in  the  long 
terms  both  income  and  wealth  distribution  is  considered  as  the  important  contributor  to  economic  stability  (Berg 
and  Ostry  2011;  Berg,  Ostry,  and  Zettelmeyer  2012;  Kumhof,  Ranciere,  and  Winant  2015;  Ostry,  Berg,  and 
Tsangarides  2014).  The  IMF  Managing  Director,  Christine  Lagarde  even  also  said  that  the  top  condition  to  have 
more  inclusive  and  sustainable  economic  growth  is  to  maintain  economic  stability  which  needs  to  deal  with  the 
problem  of  inequality  of  income.  Similarly,  INF,,  variable  have  insignificant  effect  on  Gini  index.  It  might 
happen  like  FS, ,  which  covers  only  short  period.  However,  if  we  look  at  the  sign,  the  relationship  between 
inflation  on  income  inequality  might  have  negative  impact,  i.e.  an  increase  of  inflation  level  might  have  a 
considerable  effect  on  widening  income  inequality. 

In  the  other  hand,  GDPC„  variable  measured  by  GDP  per  capita  has  positive  impact  on  income 
inequality,  p  5  shows  that  an  increase  in  GDP  per  capita  by  1%,  it  will  raise  income  inequality  by  about  0.1%. 
Kuznet  (1955)  in  this  case  explain  the  reason  why  an  increase  of  GPD  per  capita  might  widen  income  inequality. 
Kuznets  (1955)  hypothesizes  that  inequality  of  income  rises  until  reach  a  critical  level  of  income  and  then 
inequality  of  income  starts  to  decline.  It  implies  that  disparity  of  income  will  increase  in  the  early  stage  of 
development;  however,  in  the  later  stage  disparity  will  decrease.  This  condition  occurs  when  there  is  a  shifting  in 
the  economic  activity  from  rural  areas  to  the  city,  for  instance,  farmers  move  to  the  city  to  get  better  paying-job. 
This  migration  hence  yields  in  a  wide  rural-urban  income  gap  and  increases  urban  population,  while  in  the  same 
time  the  rural  population  decreases.  Income  gap,  according  to  Kuznet  (1955),  is  expected  to  decrease  when  a 
certain  level  of  average  income  is  attained.  This  condition  is  associated  with  the  process  of  industrialization. 
Thus,  the  society  is  expected  to  get  advantage  from  trickle-down  effect  which  may  effectively  reduce  income 
gap.  Trickle-down  effect  refers  to  effect  gained  by  the  low-income  group  due  to  an  increase  in  the  income  earned 
by  the  high-income  group.  Aghion  and  Bolton  (1997)  also  supports  the  arguments  that  the  addition  wealth 
accrued  by  rich  group  is  good  for  the  poor  due  to  some  of  the  additional  wealth  of  the  rich  trickles  down  to  the 
poor. 

Conclusion 

The  main  characteristic  of  Islamic  bank  is  the  prohibition  of  riba  (usury)  in  any  transaction.  It  is  thus  expected 
that  Islamic  bank  is  able  to  promote  fair  income  distribution.  Islamic  banks  in  the  last  two  decades  marked 
significant  development.  This  condition  can  be  observed  at  its  assets,  gross  loans,  total  customer  deposit  and 
overhead  cost.  Based  on  the  result  above,  it  is  empirically  shown  that  the  existence  of  Islamic  banks  may  reduce 
income  inequality  represented  by  negative  sign  of  financial  depth.  Islamic  banks  in  this  case  may  expand  their 
business  by  opening  branchless  banking  to  develop  its  market  up  to  sub-urban  area.  Even  today  technology 
supports  the  idea  to  open  branchless  banking  service.  Also,  it  is  needed  to  educate  more  people,  especially  in  the 
sub  urban,  on  financial  literacy  in  order  to  make  understand  the  needs  of  Islamic  banks  on  their  economic 
transaction. 

Other  important  finding  should  be  highlighted  is  that  the  stability  of  Islamic  bank  must  be  maintained 
due  to  it  has  direct  impact  on  income  inequality.  In  many  cases  like  what  happened  during  Asia  financial  crisis  in 
1997/8,  the  collapse  of  banking  system  harms  socio  economic  as  a  whole.  It  means  that  the  stability  of  banking 
system  (including  Islamic  bank)  has  fundamental  effect  on  economy.
