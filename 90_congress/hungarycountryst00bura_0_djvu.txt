Foreword 


This  volume  is  one  in  a  continuing  series  of  books  now  being 
prepared  by  the  Federal  Research  Division  of  the  Library  of  Con- 
gress under  the  Country  Studies — Area  Handbook  Program.  The 
last  page  of  this  book  lists  the  other  published  studies. 

Most  books  in  the  series  deal  with  a  particular  foreign  country, 
describing  and  analyzing  its  political,  economic,  social,  and  national 
security  systems  and  institutions,  and  examining  the  interrelation- 
ships of  those  systems  and  the  ways  they  are  shaped  by  cultural 
factors.  Each  study  is  written  by  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  social 
scientists.  The  authors  seek  to  provide  a  basic  understanding  of 
the  observed  society,  striving  for  a  dynamic  rather  than  a  static 
portrayal.  Particular  attention  is  devoted  to  the  people  who  make 
up  the  society,  their  origins,  dominant  beliefs  and  values,  their  com- 
mon interests  and  the  issues  on  which  they  are  divided,  the  nature 
and  extent  of  their  involvement  with  national  institutions,  and  their 
attitudes  toward  each  other  and  toward  their  social  system  and 
political  order. 

The  books  represent  the  analysis  of  the  authors  and  should  not 
be  construed  as  an  expression  of  an  official  United  States  govern- 
ment position,  policy,  or  decision.  The  authors  have  sought  to 
adhere  to  accepted  standards  of  scholarly  objectivity.  Corrections, 
additions,  and  suggestions  for  changes  from  readers  will  be  wel- 
comed for  use  in  future  editions.

Preface 


Since  the  mid-1970s,  few  countries  in  the  world  have  experienced 
such  rapid  and  extensive  change  as  Hungary.  The  political  sys- 
tem has  moved  from  an  authoritarian  regime  dominated  by  the 
Hungarian  Socialist  Workers'  Party  (HSWP)  to  a  multiparty  repub- 
lic. The  HSWP  itself  split,  in  October  1989,  and  most  of  its  lead- 
ers organized  a  new  party,  the  Hungarian  Socialist  Party.  In  the 
late  1980s,  relations  with  Western  countries  improved  dramatically, 
and  the  Hungarians  also  received  significant  support  for  their  re- 
form efforts  from  the  Soviet  Union.  By  contrast,  until  late  1989 
tensions  between  Hungary  and  Romania  were  rising  over  the  lat- 
ter' s  treatment  of  its  Hungarian  minority,  but,  after  the  Decem- 
ber 1989  revolution  in  Romania,  the  chances  for  the  resolution  of 
that  problem  improved.  Although  sporadic  efforts  had  been  under- 
taken since  the  late  1960s  to  introduce  elements  of  a  market  econ- 
omy into  a  socialist  command  economy,  Hungarian  leaders  in  1989 
declared  their  intention  to  create  a  full-fledged  capitalist  economy. 
The  government  has  also  reduced  the  defense  budget,  and  it  has 
taken  steps  to  make  the  police  apparatus  accountable  to  the  peo- 
ple and  to  their  elected  representatives.  Yet,  the  discontent  that 
emerged  from  pressures  stemming  from  the  economy's  precipitous 
decline  continued.  This  discontent,  coupled  with  the  regime's  need 
to  widen  its  support  to  sustain  the  transition  from  a  state  socialist 
to  capitalist  economy,  led  the  Hungarian  regime  to  undertake  po- 
litical reform  efforts. 

These  changes  have  necessitated  a  new  edition  of  Hungary:  A 
Country  Study,  which  supersedes  the  edition  published  in  1973.  Vir- 
tually everything  discussed  in  the  previous  edition  has  been  over- 
taken by  events.  Like  the  earlier  edition,  this  study  attempts  to 
present  the  dominant  historical,  social,  economic,  political,  and 
national  security  aspects  of  Hungary.  Sources  of  information  in- 
cluded books  and  scholarly  journals,  official  reports  of  governments 
and  international  organizations,  foreign  and  domestic  newspapers, 
and  numerous  periodicals.  A  brief  annotated  bibliographic  note 
on  sources  recommended  for  further  reading  appears  at  the  end 
of  each  chapter,  and  more  detailed  chapter  bibliographies  appear 
at  the  end  of  the  book.  Measurements  are  given  in  the  metric  sys- 
tem; a  conversion  table  is  provided  to  assist  those  readers  who  are 
unfamiliar  with  metric  measurements  (see  table  1 ,  Appendix).  A 
glossary  is  also  provided.

The  Hungarian  people  are  descendants  of  the  Magyars,  an 
Asiatic  tribe  whose  origins  lie  in  what  is  today  central  Russia.  The 
word  Hungary  appears  to  derive  from  a  Slavicized  form  of  the  Turkic 
words  on  ogur,  meaning  "ten  arrows,"  which  may  have  referred 
to  the  number  of  Magyar  tribes.  Unlike  most  Europeans,  Hun- 
garians do  not  speak  an  Indo-European  language.  Hungarian  is 
a  member  of  the  Finno-Ugric  language  family,  which  also  includes 
such  languages  as  Estonian  and  Finnish. 

The  illustration  on  the  cover  and  those  that  introduce  each  chap- 
ter merit  a  word  of  explanation.  These  drawings  were  adapted  from 
Andre  Kertesz's  poignant  photographs  of  his  native  land,  which 
were  published  in  Hungarian  Memories:  Nineteen  Twelve  to  Nineteen 
Twenty -Five.

EARLY  HISTORY 
ca.  A.D.  100-600 


Magyar  tribes,  a  pagan  Finno-Ugric  people, 
begin  migration  from  Urals  south  onto  Rus- 
sian steppes  and  continue  west,  to  area  be- 
tween Don  and  lower  Dnepr  rivers,  where 
they  fall  under  the  sway  of  the  Bulgar-Turkish 
people. 


ca.  A.D.  600-900 


MEDIEVAL  PERIOD 
Arpad  Dynasty 
ca.  900-1301 


RENAISSANCE  AND 
REFORMATION 
1301-1699 


Magyars  fall  under  the  control  of  the  Khazars 
but  are  later  freed  from  Khazar  rule  in  the 
ninth  century.  Magyars  join  Byzantine  armies 
to  fight  the  Bulgars  in  895.  Magyars  migrate 
farther  west  into  the  Danube-Tisza  Basin,  895 
or  896.  Arpad  is  chosen  as  chieftain;  his  male 
descendants  become  hereditary  heirs  of  this 
kingdom,  which  became  known  as  Hungary. 

Magyars  besiege  Europe  and  the  Byzantine  Em- 
pire but  are  defeated  by  Moravian  and  Ger- 
man armies  in  955.  Chieftain  Geza  (972-97) 
is  baptized  into  Roman  Catholic  Church. 
Geza's  son,  Stephen  I  (997-1038),  is  recog- 
nized by  Pope  Sylvester  II  as  king  of  Hun- 
gary, ensuring  independence  from  Byzantium 
and  the  Holy  Roman  Empire.  Latin  alphabet 
is  devised  for  Hungarian  language.  Magyars 
occupy  Transylvania.  Laszlo  I  (1077-95)  oc- 
cupies Slavonia  in  1090,  and  Kalman  I 
(1095-1 1 16)  takes  the  title  of  king  of  Croatia 
in  1103.  Under  Bela  111  (1173-96),  Hungary 
becomes  one  of  the  leading  powers  in  south- 
eastern Europe.  Nobles  force  Andrew  II 
(1205-35)  to  sign  Golden  Bull  (1222)  limit- 
ing crown's  power.  Mongols  rout  Hungarian 
army  at  Mohi  in  1241 .  Mongols  withdraw  in 
1242.  Arpad  line  expires  in  1301. 

Charles  Robert  (1308-42)  wins  prolonged  suc- 
cession struggle.  Dynastic  marriages  link 
Hungary  to  Naples  and  Poland.  Louis  I 
(1343-82)  reconfirms  Golden  Bull.  First 
university  is  founded  in  1367.  Hungary's  for- 
tunes begin  to  decline  under  Sigismund 
(1387-1437).  Social  turmoil  erupts  because  of 
higher  taxes  and  pressures  from  the  magnates 
on  the  lesser  nobles.  Wars  against  Ottoman 
Turks  are  waged  in  reigns  of  Albrecht  V 
(1437-39)  and  Ulaszlo  I  (1439-44).  Janos 
Hunyadi  rules  Hungary  as  regent  for  infant 
king,  Laszlo  V.  Hunyadi  defeats  the  Turks 
in  Transylvania  in  1442  and  in  Serbia  in  1443, 
is  defeated  at  Varna  in  1444,  and  defeats  the 
Turks  again  in  1456  near  Belgrade.  Nobles 
crown  Hunyadi's  son  Matyas  Corvinus 
(1458-90)  king.  Matyas  enacts  numerous

reforms.  After  the  death  of  Matyas,  an  oligar- 
chy of  magnates  takes  control,  and  the  coun- 
try remains  in  a  state  of  anarchy  until  1526, 
when  the  Turks  defeat  Hungary  at  Mohacs. 
Hungary  is  partitioned  between  the  Turks  and 
the  Habsburgs  in  1541.  Habsburgs  invade 
Transylvania  in  1591.  Habsburgs  rout  a 
Turkish  army  in  1664  at  St.  Gotthard  in  Hun- 
gary. Hungarians  rebel  against  Habsburg  rule 
in  1681.  Turks  attack  Habsburgs  but  are 
routed  near  Vienna  in  1683.  Western  cam- 
paign drives  Turks  from  Hungary,  and  Turks 
lose  almost  all  Hungarian  possessions  in  Peace 
of  Karlowitz  (1699),  which  ends  partition. 


HUNGARY  UNDER  THE 
HABSBURGS 
1700-1867 


Vienna  assumes  control  of  Hungary's  foreign 
affairs,  defense,  and  tariffs,  and  it  treats  Tran- 
sylvania as  separate  from  Hungary.  Peasant 
rebellion  in  1703  provokes  an  eight-year  up- 
rising led  by  Ferenc  Rakoczi  against  Habs- 
burg rule.  Treaty  of  Szatmar  (1711)  ends 
rebellion.  Under  Pragmatic  Sanction  (1723), 
Habsburg  monarch  agrees  to  rule  Hungary 
as  a  king  subject  to  restraints  of  Hungary's 
constitution  and  laws.  Under  Charles  VI 
(1 71 1-40)  and  Maria  Theresa  (1740-80),  the 
economy  declines.  Joseph  II  (1780-90),  an  en- 
lightened despot,  attempts  various  changes, 
but  the  nobles  resist  and  thus  inspire  a  renais- 
sance of  Hungarian  culture.  Leopold  I  (1790- 
92)  softens  Habsburg  policy.  Under  Francis 
I  (1792-1835),  Hungary  stagnates.  Toward 
the  end  of  Francis's  rule,  liberal  reformers 
Istvan  Szechenyi  and  Lajos  Kossuth  emerge; 
they  increasingly  press  their  demands  under 
Ferdinand  V  (1835-48).  In  March  1848,  a 
revolution  against  the  absolute  monarchy 
breaks  out  in  Vienna  and  quickly  spreads  to 
Budapest.  The  Hungarians  declare  indepen- 
dence in  April  1849,  but  with  the  help  of  Rus- 
sian troops  the  Habsburgs  reimpose  control. 
Franz  Joseph  (1848-1916)  revokes  the  Hun- 
garian constitution  and  assumes  absolute 
power.  Austria  is  defeated  by  Sardinia  and 
France  in  1859  and  by  Prussia  in  1866,  result- 
ing in  the  Compromise  of  1867,  which  cre- 
ates the  Dual  Monarchy  of  Austria-Hungary, 
also  known  as  the  Austro-Hungarian  Empire. 


DUAL  MONARCHY 
1867-1918 


Under  the  Dual  Monarchy,  the  Habsburg  em- 
peror reigns  as  king  of  Hungary.  A  Hun- 
garian government  administers  domestic 
affairs,  while  Vienna  manages  foreign  policy, 
defense,  and  finance.  Croatia  gains  autonomy

from  Hungary  over  its  domestic  affairs  in 
1868.  Kalman  Tisza  serves  as  prime  minister 
1875-90.  Economic  modernization  begins,  ac-

Introduction 


THE  HUNGARIAN  PEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC  came  into  existence 
in  1949  when,  with  Soviet  support,  the  Hungarian  Workers'  Party 
(HWP)  eliminated  the  last  of  its  rivals  and  proclaimed  the  coun- 
try a  "people's  democracy."  The  proclamation  of  the  Hungarian 
People's  Republic  was  part  of  Soviet  dictator  Joseph  Stalin's  plan 
to  enforce  total  Soviet  domination  over  the  countries  in  Eastern 
Europe  that  Soviet  armies  had  occupied  in  their  war  against  Nazi 
Germany. 

Like  other  countries  in  Eastern  Europe,  Hungary  was  completely 
Sovietized.  The  Constitution  of  1949  established  the  leading  role 
of  the  HWP  in  all  aspects  of  Hungarian  life.  In  turn,  the  HWP 
took  its  orders  from  Stalin.  Hungary  was  also  forced  to  adopt  the 
Soviet  model  in  its  economy  and  society.  Hungary  embarked  on 
an  ambitious  drive  to  industrialize  its  economy,  and  the  new  re- 
gime collectivized  agriculture.  The  property  of  the  prewar  ruling 
classes  was  expropriated,  and  the  regime  undertook  a  reign  of  ter- 
ror against  its  perceived  political  enemies,  who  eventually  included 
a  number  of  prominent  communists.  The  Hungarian  military  was 
subordinated  to  the  Soviet  military,  and  the  regime  established  a 
large  secret  police  force,  which  answered  to  Moscow,  not  Budapest. 

On  October  23,  1989,  the  Hungarian  People's  Republic  came 
to  an  end.  Acting  President  Matyas  Szuros  proclaimed  the  new 
republic:  "As  provisional  president  of  our  Republic,  I  greet  .  .  . 
the  citizens  of  our  country,  our  friends  abroad.  I  ceremonially  an- 
nounce that,  with  the  declaration  of  the  Constitution  amended  by 
the  National  Assembly,  as  from  today,  October  23,  1989,  our  coun- 
try's state  form  and  name  is  the  Republic  of  Hungary."  New 
amendments  to  the  Constitution  asserted  "the  values  of  both  bour- 
geois democracy  and  democratic  socialism,"  eliminated  the  clause 
of  the  Constitution  that  established  the  leading  role  of  the  com- 
munist party  in  government  and  society,  and  proclaimed  a  regime 
based  on  the  rule  of  law.  These  new  amendments  followed  the  Four- 
teenth Party  Congress  of  the  Hungarian  Socialist  Workers'  Party 
(HSWP — the  Hungarian  Workers'  Party  had  been  renamed  the 
Hungarian  Socialist  Workers'  Party  on  November  1,  1956),  in 
which  the  party  split  between  reformers  and  conservatives.  Out 
of  this  congress,  which  had  convened  October  6,  a  new  party 
emerged — the  Hungarian  Socialist  Party  (HSP) — which  was  mod- 
eled on  the  socialist  parties  of  Western  Europe  and  was  designed 
to  operate  within  a  multiparty  system.  Thus,  in  1989  Hungary 


xxvn 


experienced  a  political  transformation.  With  Poland,  it  was  in  the 
forefront  of  communist  countries  attempting  to  reform  their  polity, 
economy,  and  social  relations. 

A  number  of  internal  economic  and  social  factors  led  to  the  cri- 
sis that  brought  about  this  transformation.  A  Soviet  leadership  it- 
self attempting  to  carry  through  far-reaching  reforms  allowed 
Hungary  to  implement  radical  reforms.  The  example  of  wide- 
ranging  political  and  economic  reforms  in  Poland  also  spurred  Hun- 
gary's  leaders  to  action. 

The  economic  crisis  had  been  brewing  since  the  mid-1970s.  Be- 
ginning in  1973,  world  oil  prices  rose  precipitously,  having  a 
devastating  effect  on  Hungary,  which  was  almost  completely  de- 
pendent on  foreign  energy  suppliers,  mainly  the  Soviet  Union. 
Hungary's  leaders  responded  to  higher  energy  prices  with  a  plan 
to  accelerate  economic  growth  and  launched  a  number  of  major 
economic  projects,  but  they  could  not  carry  them  out  efficiently. 
These  efforts  were  designed  to  produce  goods  that  could  be  exported 
in  return  for  energy.  Moreover,  spending  on  consumption  and  in- 
vestment also  rose.  To  cover  the  costs  of  energy,  consumption,  and 
investment,  Hungary  borrowed  from  abroad,  but,  because  its 
exports  were  unable  to  cover  the  costs  of  its  hard-currency  bor- 
rowings, the  country  ran  up  a  large  foreign  currency  deficit.  Con- 
servatives in  the  leadership  used  these  problems  to  win  support  for 
the  reversal  of  economic  reforms  that  had  been  instituted  in  the 
late  1960s. 

Similar  problems  arose  in  the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s.  Again, 
world  energy  prices  rose,  and  Western  banks  limited  the  flow  of 
credits  as  a  result  of  the  crackdown  on  the  Solidarity  labor  move- 
ment in  Poland  and  the  insolvency  in  Romania.  Increases  in  in- 
terest rates  caused  problems  for  Hungary's  balance  of  payments. 

Hungary  joined  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see 
Glossary)  and  the  World  Bank  (see  Glossary)  in  1982.  These  in- 
stitutions compelled  Hungary  to  introduce  a  new  stabilization  pro- 
gram, which  called  for  reductions  in  spending  on  investment  and 
consumption.  Although  by  1985  spending  on  investment  was  21.8 
percent  less  than  it  had  been  in  1981,  prices  rose.  The  Sixth  Five- 
Year  Plan  (1981-85)  called  for  economic  growth  of  14  percent  to 
17  percent  over  the  previous  plan  period,  but  in  fact  growth  rose 
only  7  percent.  Industrial  production  increased  a  mere  12  percent, 
although  the  plan  called  for  growth  of  19  percent  to  22  percent. 
Exports  were  to  rise  37  to  39  percent  but  in  fact  rose  only  27  percent. 

Performance  fell  far  short  of  the  plan  in  the  late  1980s  as  well. 
In  1986  national  income,  industrial  production,  and  agricultural 
production  did  not  meet  the  levels  called  for  in  the  plan.  In  1987 


xxviii 


the  economy  fared  somewhat  better,  but  in  1988  inflation  far  ex- 
ceeded the  rate  for  the  previous  year.  Hungary's  foreign  currency 
debt  rose  from  US$8.6  billion  in  1985  to  US$18  billion  by  December 
1987. 

In  1989  the  country's  economic  problems  continued.  By  the  end 
of  1989,  Hungary  had  a  state  budget  deficit  of  approximately  62.2 
billion  forints  (for  value  of  the  forint — see  Glossary),  more  than 
three  times  the  planned  budget  deficit  of  19.5  billion  forints.  The 
foreign  debt  stood  at  US$20  billion.  Hungary  had  to  cut  its  deficit 
or  forego  the  last  installment  of  a  loan  it  had  obtained  from  the 
IMF  in  May  1988.  Inflation  continued  as  well.  Wages  rose  12  to 
13  percent  rather  than  the  planned  6  to  7  percent.  Prices  rose  15 
to  16  percent  rather  than  the  planned  12  to  15  percent.  From  Janu- 
ary through  September  1989,  industrial  production  was  only  98.4 
percent  of  what  it  had  been  during  the  same  period  in  1988.  Out- 
put of  the  manufacturing  sector  fell  5.1  percent.  Exports  rose  by 
about  22  percent  in  1989,  but  the  need  to  increase  exports  to  the 
West  forced  enterprises  to  forego  profitability  in  the  interests  of 
earning  hard  currency.  As  a  result,  bills  owed  to  Hungarian  firms 
went  unpaid.  In  1989  domestic  debt  stood  at  950  billion  forints. 

Society  felt  the  effects  of  the  country's  economic  problems.  To 
make  ends  meet,  most  Hungarians  had  to  work  very  hard;  in  many 
cases,  they  worked  more  than  one  job.  Western  analysts  estimated 
that  between  25  and  40  percent  of  the  population  lived  below  the 
poverty  level  (about  5,200  forints  per  month).  Average  monthly 
wages  were  a  mere  6,000  forints.  Official  statistics  classed  between 
1.5  million  and  3  million  people  (out  of  a  population  of  10.6  mil- 
lion) as  "socially  poor."  This  group  included  a  large  share  of  re- 
tired persons,  about  half  of  families  with  two  children,  and  70  to 
90  percent  of  families  with  three  or  more  children.  Single  heads 
of  households  and  people  working  on  less  productive  collective  farms 
or  living  on  isolated  homesteads  were  also  likely  to  be  living  below 
the  poverty  line. 

Economic  problems  took  their  toll  on  the  family.  In  the  1980s, 
every  third  marriage  ended  in  divorce,  and  single  parents  headed 
about  12  percent  of  all  families.  In  addition  to  the  heavy  work  load 
needed  to  achieve  a  decent  standard  of  living,  another  source  of 
strain  on  the  family  was  the  shortage  of  housing,  especially  for  young 
families.  Having  reduced  its  direct  role  in  the  provision  of  hous- 
ing, the  government  encouraged  private  individuals  to  construct 
their  own  homes.  By  the  late  1980s,  most  new  housing  units  were 
privately  constructed,  but  the  country  had  a  long  way  to  go  to  meet 
the  housing  needs  of  its  citizens.

In  1989  the  government  took  steps  to  solve  these  problems.  In 
contrast  to  the  Soviet  reaction  to  the  1956  uprising  in  Hungary 
and  the  1968  Prague  Spring  in  Czechoslovakia,  when  it  invaded 
these  countries  to  ensure  continued  communist  party  domination, 
the  Soviet  Union  in  1989  announced  support  for  Hungary's  polit- 
ical and  economic  reform  efforts.  Such  reforms  included  the  in- 
troduction of  a  capitalist  market  economy  and  the  emergence  of 
a  multiparty  system,  anathema  to  the  old  communist  system. 

In  addition,  Hungary  could  count  on  Poland  to  join  it  in  a  pro- 
reform  bloc  within  the  Warsaw  Pact  alliance  (see  Glossary).  In  June 
1989,  the  first  free  elections  in  the  history  of  postwar  Eastern  Eu- 
rope took  place  in  Poland.  These  elections  eventually  brought  to 
power  a  Solidarity-led  government  that  intended  to  institute  many 
of  the  same  political  and  economic  reforms  in  Poland  that  Hun- 
gary's leaders,  as  well  as  Hungary's  opposition  groups,  envisaged 
for  their  country.  In  late  1989,  the  reform  bloc  within  the  Warsaw 
Pact  was  strengthened  as  the  German  Democratic  Republic  (East 
Germany),  Bulgaria,  and  Czechoslovakia  began  their  own  reform 
efforts. 

Although  the  most  important  steps  toward  creating  a  democracy 
were  taken  in  late  1989,  the  effort  actually  began  with  a  number 
of  measures  in  the  first  half  of  the  year.  On  January  11,  1989,  the 
National  Assembly  passed  laws  on  associations  and  assembly,  the 
first  in  a  series  of  steps  aimed  at  introducing  a  multiparty  system 
in  Hungary.  On  March  15,  1989,  for  the  first  time  in  postwar  his- 
tory, the  government  allowed  commemoration  of  the  anniversary 
of  the  1848  revolt  against  the  Habsburg  Empire.  About  100,000 
people  attended  the  demonstration  in  Budapest,  and  smaller  demon- 
strations took  place  throughout  the  country.  The  demonstrators 
called  for  government  recognition  of  civil  and  political  rights  and 
political  pluralism.  Shortly  thereafter,  Imre  Mecs,  a  member  of 
the  dissident  Committee  for  Historical  Justice,  said  that  a  return 
to  the  old  ways  of  ruling  the  country  would  be  very  difficult  4  'after 
hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  throughout  the  country  have 
shouted  out  demands  for  their  rights."  On  March  22,  1989,  the 
National  Assembly  passed  a  law  that  granted  the  right  to  strike 
(although  within  strictly  defined  limits). 

The  reburial  of  Imre  Nagy  and  his  associates  on  June  1 6  marked 
the  most  important  symbolic  break  with  Hungary's  past  in  the  first 
half  of  1989.  Most  Hungarians  had  never  accepted  the  regime's 
verdict  that  the  events  of  1956  represented  a  counterrevolution 
against  Marxism-Leninism.  The  massive  attendance  at  the  rebu- 
rial and  the  millions  who  watched  the  events  on  television  showed 


xxx 


that  Hungarians  rejected  the  regime  that  had  been  placed  in  power 
by  Soviet  troops  in  1956. 

The  media  were  becoming  more  open  as  a  consequence  of  the 
reforms.  In  late  1988,  a  number  of  independent  publications  had 
been  established,  including  Kapu  (Gate),  which  had  a  circulation 
of  more  than  35,000  by  January  1989;  Reform,  part  of  a  joint  ven- 
ture with  media  magnate  Axel  Springer's  conglomerate  in  the  Fed- 
eral Republic  of  Germany  (West  Germany),  which  by  early  1989 
had  a  circulation  of  256,000;  and  Hitel  (Credit),  which  covered  so- 
cial and  political  issues  and  literature. 

It  was  the  HSWP  that  set  the  stage  for  more  profound  changes. 
Party  leaders  Imre  Pozsgay  and  Rezso  Nyers  sought  to  manage 
the  country's  severe  economic,  social,  and  political  problems  by 
sharing  power  with  organizations  representing  other  sectors  of  the 
population.  Indeed,  the  party's  reformist  wing — which  was  headed 
by  Pozsgay  and  Nyers — had  accepted  the  ideas  and  program  of 
the  opposition. 

The  strength  of  the  reformers  became  apparent  at  a  February 
10,  1989,  plenum  of  the  Central  Committee  of  the  HSWP.  At  that 
plenum,  the  party  set  as  its  goal  the  achievement  of  popular 
sovereignty  and  a  constitutional  state.  At  a  February  20  plenum, 
the  party  Central  Committee  approved  a  draft  of  a  new  constitu- 
tion that  contained  no  clause  on  the  leading  role  of  the  party.  At 
its  March  1989  plenum,  the  party  Central  Committee  came  out 
in  support  of  a  multiparty  system,  free  elections,  and  independent 
trade  unions;  recognized  certain  individual  freedoms;  and  called 
for  the  creation  of  a  state  governed  by  a  democratic  socialist  con- 
stitution and  characterized  by  an  independent  judiciary,  represen- 
tative democracy,  and  depoliticized  military.  The  party's  new 
Action  Program  "offered  cooperation  and  agreement  on  national 
issues  of  vital  importance  to  all  citizens  and  organizations  that  think 
in  a  progressive  manner  and  accept  responsibility  for  the  country. " 
In  line  with  its  changed  outlook,  the  Central  Committee  gave  up 
its  nomenklatura  (see  Glossary)  authority.  According  to  one  party 
spokesman,  this  right  had  become  "obsolete."  Indeed,  on  May 
10,  1989,  the  National  Assembly  approved  a  government  reshuf- 
fle involving  five  ministers  and  one  state  secretary  with  ministeri- 
al rank.  Chairman  of  the  Council  of  Ministers  Miklos  Nemeth 
himself,  rather  than  the  Central  Committee  of  the  HSWP,  selected 
the  new  officials. 

The  Central  Committee  also  outlined  a  reform  program  for  the 
economy.  At  its  February  10  plenum,  the  Central  Committee  de- 
termined to  end  the  country's  "economic,  political,  and  moral  cri- 
sis" by  creating  a  market  economy  based  on  mixed  ownership.  On 


xxxi 


May  4,  1989,  the  Central  Committee  released  its  "Proposal  for 
a  Three- Year  Transformation  and  Stabilization  Program,"  which 
called  for  opening  up  Hungary  to  world  markets  and  trade  and 
maintaining  the  country's  solvency  and  creditworthiness.  The 
proposal  advocated  a  change  from  state  ownership  to  stock  com- 
panies and  limited  partnerships  and  "the  sale  of  state-owned  [en- 
terprises] to  foreigners  and  private  individuals."  State  subsidies 
to  enterprises  would  be  drastically  reduced.  The  proposal  stressed 
the  importance  of  small-  and  medium- sized  companies.  For  agricul- 
ture, the  proposal  advocated  private  ownership,  easy  lease  terms, 
and  the  purchase  of  land  by  private  individuals. 

The  new  legislation  on  political  parties  and  the  liberalized  at- 
mosphere in  the  country  led  to  the  formation  of  many  new  poli- 
tical parties.  Indeed,  with  the  decisions  made  by  the  HS WP  in  the 
late  winter  of  1988  and  spring  of  1989,  it  was  clear  that  the  HS  WP 
was  taking  many  aspects  of  its  own  reform  program  from  the  pro- 
grams of  other  parties  and  organizations  promoting  fundamental 
political  and  economic  changes.  Many  of  these  parties  were  not 
altogether  new,  however;  they  were  revivals  of  historical  parties 
that  had  been  disbanded  in  the  late  1940s.  Other  parties  were  in- 
deed new,  formed  largely  by  dissident  intellectuals  and  students. 

The  first  historical  party  to  reemerge  after  years  of  inactivity  was 
the  Independent  Smallholders'  Party,  which  was  refounded  in 
November  1988.  In  August  1989,  the  Smallholders  had  an  esti- 
mated 6,000  members  grouped  into  230  chapters.  The  party  called 
for  privatization  of  the  economy  and  free  enterprise;  returning  land 
to  the  peasants  from  whom  it  had  been  seized  during  Hungary's 
campaign  to  collectivize  agriculture  in  the  late  1940s;  free  elections 
in  a  pluralistic  multiparty  political  system;  and  a  new  constitution 
that  would  include  a  clause  establishing  Hungary's  neutrality. 

Another  historical  party  that  reestablished  itself  was  the  Hun- 
garian Independence  Party,  which  was  refounded  on  April  24,  1989. 
The  members  of  the  original  Hungarian  Independence  Party  had 
broken  with  the  Smallholders'  Party  in  1947  because  they  believed 
that  the  Smallholders  were  too  willing  to  cooperate  with  the  Hun- 
garian Communist  Party.  In  1989  the  main  political  goal  of  the 
Hungarian  Independence  Party  was  "the  purest  democracy."  It 
advocated  government  recognition  of  individual  political  and  civil 
rights;  the  removal  of  communist  party  control  over  the  army, 
police,  and  judiciary;  the  expansion  of  legislative  power  at  the  ex- 
pense of  the  executive;  a  free  market  system;  strong  support  for 
private  sector  entrepreneurship;  tax  relief  to  encourage  entre- 
preneurs; the  reprivatization  of  agriculture;  and  "perpetual  neu- 
trality" for  Hungary.

The  Democratic  People's  Party  was  active  in  Hungarian  poli- 
tics in  the  late  1940s  but  was  banned  in  1949.  In  1989  this  party 
reappeared  as  the  Christian  Democratic  People's  Party,  which  grew 
out  of  the  Aron  Marton  Association  (named  after  a  Catholic  bishop 
in  Transylvania).  The  draft  program  of  the  Christian  Democratic 
People's  Party  defined  it  as  "a  political  organization  with  a  Chris- 
tian worldview  that  is,  however,  independent  of  the  Churches." 
It  called  for  multiparty  democracy,  parliamentary  government,  full 
guarantees  for  human  and  civil  rights,  and  autonomy  for  local  com- 
munities. For  the  economy,  this  party  advocated  free  enterprise 
combined  with  a  welfare  system  to  help  those  disadvantaged  by 
a  free  market  system.  In  foreign  policy,  the  Christian  Democratic 
People's  Party  called  for  accelerating  Hungary's  integration  into 
Europe  and  the  country's  return  to  the  fold  of  Christian  civilization. 

Finally,  among  the  historical  parties,  the  Social  Democratic  Party 
was  refounded  on  January  9,  1989.  Originally  founded  in  1890, 
the  Social  Democratic  Party  was  forced  to  merge  with  the  Hun- 
garian Communist  Party  in  June  1948  to  create  the  Hungarian 
Workers'  Party.  Leaders  of  the  reemergent  Social  Democratic  Party 
claimed  30,000  members,  but  the  actual  figure  was  closer  to  3,000. 
The  party  was  weakened  by  a  split  between  those  who  had  belonged 
to  the  party  before  1948  and  younger  members  who  sought  leader- 
ship positions.  The  Social  Democratic  Party  advocated  a  West 
European-style  social  democracy  for  Hungary. 

Of  the  new  political  parties,  the  largest  at  the  end  of  1989  was 
the  Hungarian  Democratic  Forum,  which  was  founded  on  Sep- 
tember 27,  1987.  In  November  1989,  the  forum  had  approximately 
20,200  members  organized  into  327  local  organizations  in  306 
localities  across  Hungary.  This  party  was  largely  the  creation  of 
the  provincial  intelligentsia  and  was  closely  identified  with  Hun- 
garian populism  (an  interwar  political  movement  that  distrusted 
Western  capitalism  and  favored  an  economy  based  on  small  agricul- 
tural producers  and  independent  peasant  entrepreneurs;  it  also  in- 
cluded antirationalist  and  anti-semitic  strains).  It  advocated  free 
and  democratic  elections,  a  multiparty  system,  an  increase  in  fund- 
ing for  education  and  culture,  improvement  of  social  security,  and 
a  greater  role  for  the  church  in  providing  social  services.  The  Hun- 
garian Democratic  Forum  came  out  for  a  "third  road"  for  the  econ- 
omy: an  economy  neither  capitalist  nor  socialist.  It  proposed 
dismantling  the  state  sector  in  a  "  socially  controlled  and  economi- 
cally rational  way"  and  encouraging  the  emergence  of  an  entre- 
preneurial stratum.  However,  the  entrepreneurs  were  to  be  groups, 
not  individuals.

The  Alliance  of  Free  Democrats  was  founded  on  December  1 3 , 
1988.  In  July  1989,  the  alliance  had  about  3,000  members,  who 
were  organized  into  twenty  chapters  in  Budapest  and  fifteen  in  the 
counties.  This  party  was  largely  the  creation  of  the  Budapest  in- 
telligentsia. Two  ideological  strains  made  up  the  alliance:  demo- 
cratic socialists,  who  favored  state  intervention  in  the  economy  and 
a  mixture  of  both  state  and  private  property;  and  classical  liberals, 
who  supported  an  unrestrained  free  market  and  the  denationali- 
zation of  the  economy.  The  party's  program  called  for  a  new  con- 
stitution to  end  the  communist  party's  monopoly  of  power,  to  secure 
the  sovereignty  of  the  people,  and  to  limit  the  power  of  the  state 
by  separating  the  powers  of  the  executive,  legislature,  and  judiciary. 
In  the  economic  realm,  the  alliance's  program  called  for  the  "dena- 
tionalization of  the  economy,"  the  expansion  of  private  ownership, 
cuts  in  military  expenditure,  and  state  assistance  to  the  poorest 
members  of  the  population  to  minimize  poverty.  In  foreign  pol- 
icy, the  alliance  advocated  neutrality  for  Hungary  and  the  with- 
drawal of  Soviet  troops. 

The  Federation  of  Young  Democrats,  founded  in  1988,  was  made 
up  of  4,000  to  5,000  members  between  the  ages  of  sixteen  and  thirty- 
five.  Members  were  mainly  college  and  university  students.  The 
party  advocated  a  multiparty  system,  political  and  military  indepen- 
dence, the  evolution  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  into  a  political  alliance, 
and  the  privatization  of  economic  assets. 

In  the  spring  of  1989,  several  opposition  parties  joined  together 
to  form  the  Opposition  Roundtable  to  establish  new  rules  for  the 
conduct  of  politics  as  Hungary  entered  the  era  of  reform.  The 
roundtable  was  made  up  of  the  Alliance  of  Free  Democrats,  the 
Hungarian  Democratic  Forum,  the  Social  Democratic  Party,  the 
Independent  Smallholders'  Party,  the  Hungarian  People's  Party, 
the  Federation  of  Young  Democrats,  and  the  Endre  Bajcsy- 
Zsilinszky  Society  (an  organization  dedicated  to  environmental 
protection  and  the  defense  of  Hungarian  minority  rights  in  Roma- 
nia). (The  Democratic  League  of  Free  Trade  Unions  had  observ- 
er status  at  the  roundtable.)  The  Opposition  Roundtable  had  two 
basic  objectives:  to  enter  into  talks  with  the  HSWP  to  determine 
the  principles  and  rules  that  would  govern  the  transition  to  a 
pluralist  democracy,  and  to  discuss  the  means  necessary  to  over- 
come Hungary's  social  and  economic  crisis. 

In  June  1989,  the  Opposition  Roundtable  entered  into  formal 
talks  with  the  HSWP  and  the  so-called  "third  side,"  which  was 
made  up  of  the  Patriotic  People's  Front,  the  National  Council  of 
Trade  Unions,  and  other  organizations  allied  with  the  HSWP.  In 
the  negotiations,  one  committee  dealt  with  political  matters, 


xxxiv 


including  constitutional  changes,  establishment  of  a  presidency, 
setting  of  a  date  for  elections  to  the  National  Assembly,  revisions 
of  the  penal  code,  creation  of  a  new  law  on  information,  and  secur- 
ing of  guarantees  against  a  violent  rollback  of  the  reform  process. 
A  second  committee  dealt  with  economic  problems,  including  the 
reform  of  property  rights,  the  introduction  and  strengthening  of 
market  mechanisms  in  the  economy,  and,  most  generally,  "stra- 
tegic questions  of  dealing  with  the  economic  crisis"  and  the  means 
of  treating  the  social  consequences  of  the  crisis. 

The  Opposition  Roundtable  and  the  party  had  different  objec- 
tives in  the  negotiations.  The  former  negotiated  on  the  premise 
that  the  roots  of  the  economic  crisis  lay  in  the  political  system;  it 
therefore  sought  to  emphasize  constitutional  changes  and  overall 
political  reform.  By  contrast,  the  HSWP  emphasized  measures  to 
alter  the  economy.  Thus,  the  party  sought  to  make  the  opposition 
groups  in  the  roundtable  share  responsibility  for  the  dislocations, 
unemployment,  and  inflation  that  would  accompany  the  effort  to 
pull  Hungary  out  of  its  economic  crisis.  The  party  hoped  to  share 
political  responsibility  and  yet  give  up  as  little  power  as  possible. 
The  HSWP  hoped  to  exact  agreement  to  its  economic  reform  pro- 
gram by  threatening  to  effect  political  reforms  without  the  partici- 
pation of  the  Opposition  Roundtable.  About  75  percent  of  the 
delegates  to  the  National  Assembly  were  HSWP  members,  and 
the  party  leadership  believed  it  could  ram  through  reforms  using 
its  vast  majority  in  the  legislature. 

The  parties  that  made  up  the  Opposition  Roundtable  represented 
only  a  very  small  fraction  of  the  population.  Further,  the  HSWP, 
although  numbering  several  hundred  thousand  members,  had  lit- 
tle claim  to  legitimacy  within  society.  The  members  of  the  "third 
side"  also  had  little  support  among  society  as  a  whole.  Thus,  in 
the  summer  of  1989  a  number  of  critics  complained  that  the  popu- 
lation as  a  whole  had  no  say  in  the  negotiations  that  were  deter- 
mining Hungary's  political  and  economic  future. 

In  several  elections  to  fill  seats  in  the  National  Assembly  that 
had  been  vacated,  the  population  did  have  the  chance  to  make  its 
voice  heard.  The  HSWP  lost  every  election. 

On  July  22,  1989,  Gabor  Rozsik  was  the  first  opposition  candi- 
date elected  to  the  National  Assembly.  He  ran  for  election  in  the 
town  of  Godollo,  near  Budapest,  and  won  69.5  percent  of  the  vote. 
Rozsik  was  a  candidate  of  the  Hungarian  Democratic  Forum  but 
also  had  the  support  of  the  Alliance  of  Free  Democrats  and  the 
Federation  of  Young  Democrats. 

In  other  elections  held  on  July  22,  either  less  than  the  required 
50  percent  of  the  eligible  voters  of  the  election  district  participated 


xxxv 


or  else  none  of  the  candidates  managed  to  receive  a  majority  of 
the  votes  cast.  In  Szeged  the  Hungarian  Democratic  Forum's  can- 
didate won  59.4  percent  of  the  vote,  but  the  turnout  was  less  than 
the  required  50  percent.  In  the  repeat  election  on  August  5,  the 
Hungarian  Democratic  Forum's  candidate  won  with  about  62  per- 
cent of  the  vote,  while  the  HSWP's  candidate  received  22  percent 
of  the  vote.  In  Kecskemet  no  candidate  received  the  majority  of 
votes,  but  in  the  August  5  runoff  election,  the  Hungarian  Demo- 
cratic Forum's  candidate  won  with  about  70  percent  of  the  vote. 
In  the  July  22  election  in  Kiskunf-elegyhaza,  61  percent  of  the  peo- 
ple voted,  but  no  candidate  received  a  majority.  The  HSWP's  can- 
didate, however,  won  44.7  percent  of  the  votes,  the  highest  vote 
total.  In  the  repeat  election,  only  46  percent  of  eligible  voters  par- 
ticipated, and  the  result  was  therefore  invalid. 

Finally,  in  a  September  16  election  for  a  National  Assembly  seat 
in  Zala  County,  the  HSWP  candidate  received  less  than  one-third 
of  the  votes  cast.  The  Hungarian  Democratic  Forum,  the  Alliance 
of  Free  Democrats,  and  the  Federation  of  Young  Democrats  all 
supported  the  winner,  who  received  more  than  59  percent  of  the 
vote. 

These  elections  demonstrated  serious  weaknesses  on  the  part  of 
the  HSWP.  In  all  locales,  despite  almost  a  total  monopoly  of  the 
media  and  overwhelming  advantages  over  the  opposition  in  funds 
available  to  run  campaigns,  HSWP  candidates  showed  poorly. 
These  elections  served  as  yet  another  reminder  that  the  HSWP  had 
either  to  transform  itself  fundamentally  or  to  resign  itself  to  a  mar- 
ginal role  in  Hungary's  new  political  system. 

Other  evidence  for  the  lack  of  support  for  the  HSWP  came  from 
poll  data.  A  survey  conducted  by  Janos  Simon  and  Laszlo  Bruszt 
of  the  Sociological  and  Social  Science  Institute  of  the  Hungarian 
Academy  of  Sciences  found  that  only  36.5  percent  of  those  sur- 
veyed would  vote  for  the  HSWP.  Most  of  that  support  came  in 
the  villages  and  small  towns.  The  support  of  the  remainder  of  those 
surveyed  was  divided  among  the  Social  Democratic  Party  (13  per- 
cent); the  Hungarian  Democratic  Forum  (11.4  percent);  the  Alli- 
ance of  Free  Democrats  (5.6  percent);  the  Smallholders'  Party  (5.4 
percent);  the  Hungarian  People's  Party  (4.3  percent);  and  the 
Christian  Democratic  People's  Party  (4.3  percent). 

The  lack  of  public  support  for  the  HSWP  did  not  deter  it  from 
attempting  to  carry  through  its  objectives  in  negotiations  with  the 
Opposition  Roundtable.  In  September  an  agreement  was  signed 
that  seemed  at  least  in  the  short  run  to  have  met  the  HSWP's  ob- 
jectives. In  addition,  this  agreement  caused  a  split  in  the  round- 
table  itself,  thereby  seeming  to  bring  additional  benefits  to  the  party.

The  agreement  between  the  HSWP  and  the  Hungarian 
Democratic  Forum,  the  Independent  Smallholders'  Party,  the  Hun- 
garian People's  Party,  and  the  Endre  Bajscy-Zsilinszky  Society  was 
to  establish  "the  political  and  legal  conditions  for  a  peaceful  tran- 
sition to  a  multiparty  system."  It  contained  six  draft  laws  dealing 
with  the  following  issues:  the  establishment  of  a  constitutional  court 
to  ensure  the  constitutionality  of  legislation;  the  acceptance  by  the 
HSWP  of  the  values  of  bourgeois  democracy  and  democratic  so- 
cialism; a  draft  electoral  law;  amendments  to  the  penal  code  and 
criminal  code  to  ensure  that  they  "conform  to  the  accepted  norms 
of  human  and  civil  rights";  an  increase  in  the  amount  of  state  aid 
for  election  campaigns  from  35  million  forints  to  100  million  forints; 
and  the  surrender  by  the  HSWP  of  some  2  billion  forints  of  its 
assets  to  finance  other  political  parties. 

The  agreement  also  called  for  the  creation  of  a  presidency  that 
would  embody  the  unity  of  the  nation,  exercise  authority  through 
the  Council  of  Ministers,  and  act  as  commander  in  chief  of  the 
armed  forces  in  peacetime.  Any  party  or  group  with  50,000  sup- 
porting signatures  could  nominate  candidates  for  president  and  vice 
president.  The  winning  candidate  would  have  to  receive  at  least 
half  the  votes  with  a  minimum  turnout  of  half  to  two-thirds  of  the 
electorate.  If  no  candidate  received  the  necessary  number  of  votes, 
a  second  round  of  voting  would  be  held.  According  to  the  agree- 
ment, the  presidential  election  was  to  take  place  before  new  elec- 
tions to  the  National  Assembly. 

The  Alliance  of  Free  Democrats  and  the  Federation  of  Young 
Democrats  did  not  sign  the  agreement.  First,  they  argued  that  it 
failed  to  require  the  withdrawal  of  the  HSWP  from  the  workplace, 
a  presence  that  lay  at  the  basis  of  the  party's  substantial  control 
over  the  economy.  Second,  these  two  parties  maintained  that  the 
agreement  did  not  call  upon  the  HSWP  to  render  a  full  account- 
ing of  its  finances  and  property.  Third,  the  Alliance  of  Free 
Democrats  and  the  Federation  of  Young  Democrats  also  believed 
that  the  agreement  was  inadequate  because  it  did  not  call  for  the 
dissolution  of  the  Workers'  Guard,  the  HSWP's  private  army. 

Fourth  and  perhaps  most  important,  the  Alliance  of  Free 
Democrats  and  the  Federation  of  Young  Democrats  held  that  the 
agreement  was  seriously  flawed  in  setting  the  elections  for  presi- 
dent before  the  elections  to  the  National  Assembly.  The  HSWP 
wanted  the  elections  for  president  to  be  held  relatively  quickly  be- 
cause its  candidate — Imre  Pozsgay — was  the  most  popular  politi- 
cal figure  in  the  country  at  the  time.  For  its  part,  the  Hungarian 
Democratic  Forum  minimized  the  importance  of  Pozsgay 's  can- 
didacy because  of  the  difficulty  of  even  a  well-known  politician's 


xxxvii 


winning  an  absolute  majority,  the  damage  already  caused  to 
Pozsgay's  candidacy  by  his  role  in  the  HSWP  leadership,  and  the 
fact  that  Pozsgay  could  not  count  on  the  support  of  the  conserva- 
tive and  centrist  factions  of  the  HSWP.  The  Alliance  of  Free 
Democrats  argued,  by  contrast,  that  election  of  a  president  before 
the  elections  to  the  National  Assembly  would  distort  the  parliamen- 
tary elections,  that  only  the  new  National  Assembly  should  have 
the  power  to  define  the  role  of  the  elections  to  the  National  As- 
sembly, and  that  the  new  president  could  unduly  influence  the  out- 
come of  the  elections  to  the  National  Assembly.  Finally,  the  Alliance 
of  Free  Democrats  and  the  Federation  of  Young  Democrats  under- 
scored the  dangers  of  electing  a  communist  president  in  a  fledg- 
ling democracy. 

The  Alliance  of  Free  Democrats  and  the  Federation  of  Young 
Democrats  decided  to  call  for  the  resolution  of  these  four  issues 
by  a  popular  referendum.  According  to  a  law  passed  on  June  15, 
1989,  100,000  signatures  would  be  sufficient  to  call  for  a  binding 
popular  referendum  on  matters  subject  to  political  dispute.  The 
two  parties  managed  to  collect  almost  200,000  signatures,  and  a 
referendum  was  scheduled  for  November  26.  The  Alliance  of  Free 
Democrats  and  the  Federation  of  Young  Democrats  both  urged 
Hungarians  to  render  a  vote  of  "yes' '  on  the  following  issues:  dis- 
banding the  Workers'  Guard,  abolishing  party  cells  in  the  work- 
place, demanding  that  the  HSWP  give  a  full  account  of  its  assets, 
and  requiring  that  the  newly  elected  National  Assembly  elect  the 
president. 

On  September  18,  1989,  negotiations  on  the  economy  began  be- 
tween the  Opposition  Roundtable  and  the  HSWP.  Talks  were 
quickly  suspended  in  the  third  committee,  which  was  charged  with 
discussing  changes  in  ownership  and  determining  how  many  en- 
terprises should  remain  under  state  control.  Talks  proceeded  in 
the  other  five  committees,  which  dealt  with  the  state  budget  deficit, 
major  state  investments,  social  welfare,  land  reform,  and  owner- 
ship reform. 

HSWP  losses  in  the  four  valid  National  Assembly  elections,  the 
agreement  with  elements  of  the  Opposition  Roundtable,  and  the 
widespread  dissatisfaction  with  the  agreement  reached  between  the 
roundtable  and  the  party  set  the  stage  for  the  Fourteenth  Party 
Congress  of  the  HSWP,  which  began  on  October  6,  1989.  These 
events  demonstrated  that  Hungary  had  entered  a  new  political  era 
in  which  the  methods  and  structure  of  a  Marxist-Leninist  party 
were  no  longer  relevant.  The  decisions  reached  at  the  Fourteenth 
Party  Congress  marked  an  attempt  by  the  party  leadership  to  adapt 
to  this  new  era. 


xxxvm 


The  party  had  undergone  some  significant  changes  prior  to  the 
congress.  The  most  important  among  these  changes  was  the  emer- 
gence of  factions  within  the  party.  Marxist-Leninist  parties  had 
long  condemned  factions  within  their  ranks;  decision  making  was 
carried  out  via  democratic  centralism,  which  required  a  unified 
party  position  in  support  of  the  leadership  on  all  issues  of  theory 
and  practice. 

In  late  1988  and  1989,  factions  did  indeed  arise  within  the  party, 
whose  leadership  was  split  between  reformers  (who  encouraged  the 
rise  of  factions)  and  conservatives  (who  condemned  the  incipient 
factions).  Factions  in  support  of  reforms  within  the  party — known 
as  the  "reform  circles" — had  been  growing  rapidly  since  Novem- 
ber 1988,  when  the  first  groups  were  organized  by  Jozsef  Geczi 
of  the  Department  of  Political  Theory  at  Attila  Jozsef  University 
in  Szeged.  The  first  national  conference  of  reform  circles  took  place 
in  Szeged  on  May  21-22,  1989,  and  was  attended  by  more  than 
400  representatives  of  110  reform  groups.  The  manifesto  produced 
by  the  conference  maintained  that  problems  in  Hungary  were  part 
of  a  "crisis  of  Asiatic  despotism."  The  document  called  for  the 
building  of  a  new  organization  based  on  the  values  of  the  Hungar- 
ian progressive  movement,  the  socialist  movement,  progressive 
bourgeois  traditions,  and  Hungarian  populism.  The  manifesto 
demanded  the  reform  of  the  HSWP.  The  reform  circles  also  held 
a  second  conference  in  Budapest  on  September  2-3  to  prepare  for 
the  party  congress. 

By  contrast,  the  Ferenc  Miinnich  Society  (named  after  the 
minister  of  the  armed  forces  and  internal  affairs  who  came  to  power 
with  Janos  Kadar  in  1956)  was  a  faction  formed  by  party  conser- 
vatives in  November  1988.  Retired  army  officers,  retired  state  secu- 
rity officers,  members  of  the  Workers'  Guard,  and  conservative 
party  members  predominated  among  its  10,000  to  20,000  mem- 
bers. According  to  Robert  Ribanszki,  who  was  one  of  the  socie- 
ty's leaders,  "the  primary  goal  of  the  [Ferenc  Miinnich  Society] 
is  to  stop  the  further  deterioration  of  socialist  achievements  .  .  . 
and  to  lend  support  to  the  development  and  strengthening  of  so- 
cialism." The  Ferenc  Miinnich  Society  sought  the  retention  of  the 
HSWP's  leading  role  in  social,  economic,  and  governmental  in- 
stitutions. It  strongly  criticized  the  reform  circles  and  the  party's 
reform  leaders,  chiefly  Pozsgay  and  Nyers. 

Delegates  to  the  Fourteenth  Party  Congress  of  the  HSWP  came 
from  the  different  party  factions.  In  fact,  the  rules  for  election  of 
delegates  expressly  called  for  the  representation  of  these  factions 
at  the  congress.  Every  party  member  could  "propose  delegates  and 
be  eligible  for  election."  The  guidelines  stressed  that  members  were 


xxxix 


to  acquaint  themselves  with  the  views  of  candidates  prior  to  the 
election  of  delegates,  so  they  could  vote  for  the  representatives  of 
the  faction  of  their  choice.  At  the  congress  itself,  Pozsgay  stated 
that  "our  party  will  respect  the  freedom  of  platforms  and  trends, 
and  respect  the  protection  of  minority  rights  more  strongly"  than 
the  former  party.  The  guidelines  for  delegate  selection  and  Pozs- 
gay's  sentiments  starkly  contrasted  with  election  procedures  for 
previous  congresses. 

To  be  sure,  party  leaders  did  not  always  follow  the  guidelines 
in  carrying  out  the  delegate  selection.  Nevertheless,  a  number  of 
platforms  were  strongly  represented  at  the  congress.  At  the  begin- 
ning of  the  proceedings,  the  Reform  Alliance  had  464  delegates; 
the  People's  Democratic  Platform  (a  centrist  grouping),  68  dele- 
gates; the  For  the  Equality  of  Chances  of  the  Provinces  Platform, 
35  delegates;  the  For  the  HSWP  Platform,  35  delegates;  the  Young 
People's  Platform,  28  delegates;  and  the  Agricultural  and  Food 
Processing  Platform,  28  delegates.  In  addition,  in  another  depar- 
ture from  previous  congresses,  delegates  from  districts  south  of  Lake 
Balaton  and  the  southwest  met  to  decide  on  a  common  approach 
to  the  interests  of  their  regions  (see  fig.  1). 

The  Reform  Alliance  was  the  best  organized  of  the  factions,  and 
it  had  the  most  elaborate  program.  By  the  end  of  the  second  day 
of  the  congress,  the  Reform  Alliance  had  511  members,  about  40 
percent  of  the  total.  This  faction  played  an  important  role  in  the 
outcome  of  the  congress.  It  called  for  an  open  break  with  the  past, 
as  well  as  for  a  repudiation  of  the  HSWP's  crimes  and  mistakes, 
and  it  sought  to  staff  leadership  positions  with  new  personnel  who 
would  promote  new  kinds  of  policies.  The  Reform  Alliance  also 
advocated  the  democratization  of  party  decision  making. 

Indeed,  in  large  measure  the  congress  produced  the  new  poli- 
cies called  for  by  the  Reform  Alliance.  To  begin  with,  the  party 
changed  its  name  to  the  Hungarian  Socialist  Party  (HSP).  The 
party's  statutes  still  defined  it  as  a  "Marxist  political  organization," 
but  it  fully  accepted  "the  values  of  human  development,  human- 
ism, freedom,  and  democracy."  The  term  Leninist  did  not  appear 
in  any  of  the  documents  emanating  from  the  congress. 

The  HSP's  manifesto  dedicated  the  organization  to  building  a 
"democratic,  law-governed  state  marked  by  direct  democracy"  and 
the  creation  of  a  "market-based  economy."  The  party  also  called 
for  a  social  welfare  policy  to  moderate  extreme  differences  in  liv- 
ing standards  but  at  the  same  time  advocated  a  system  of  wages 
and  salaries  to  reward  productivity.  The  party's  program  sought 
an  "undisturbed  and  balanced  relationship"  with  the  Soviet  Union 
but  at  the  same  time  obligated  the  party  to  work  for  mutually 


xl 


advantageous  political  and  economic  relations  with  every  coun- 
try and  with  every  "integrating  and  cooperative  organization." 
Finally,  the  HSP  came  out  firmly  in  support  of  minority  rights 
within  Hungary  and  castigated  the  violation  of  the  rights  of  Hun- 
garians elsewhere. 

The  HSP's  rejection  of  Leninist  organizational  principles  was 
clearly  apparent  in  its  new  organizational  structure.  The  bylaws 
allowed  freedom  of  choice  in  joining  or  leaving  the  party;  freedom 
of  conscience,  expression,  and  action;  and  tolerance  of  different 
views,  opinions,  and  trends  within  the  party.  It  also  located  in  the 
will  of  the  membership  the  source  of  every  decision  and  action  by 
the  party.  According  to  the  bylaws,  any  minority  view  that  had 
the  support  of  at  least  10  percent  of  the  membership  was  to  be  stated 
along  with  the  position  of  the  majority.  Terms  of  office  for  party 
officials  were  to  be  decided  by  the  electing  forum;  nominations  were 
to  take  place  by  open  ballot,  and  elections  were  to  be  held  by  secret 
ballot. 

The  party  congress  was  to  be  the  HSP's  highest  representative 
and  decision-making  organ.  The  National  Steering  Committee 
replaced  the  Central  Committee  to  act  as  "the  party  membership's 
representative  and  control  organ  between  the  congresses."  The  Na- 
tional Presidium,  consisting  of  twenty-five  people,  was  to  lead  the 
party  between  congresses.  Except  for  the  chairman  of  the  HSP, 
members  of  the  National  Presidium  could  not  be  members  of  the 
Steering  Committee.  The  party  leader,  called  the  chairman,  was 
to  be  elected  by  a  secret  ballot  of  the  party  congress.  Rezso  Nyers 
was  elected  chairman  of  the  HSP  with  87  percent  of  the  vote.  The 
chairman  and  the  leader  of  the  party's  bloc  in  the  National  As- 
sembly served  as  ex  officio  members  of  the  National  Presidium; 
all  others  were  elected  from  a  slate  of  candidates  prepared  by  the 
delegates  to  the  congress,  by  a  nominating  committee,  or  by  the 
chairman.  The  National  Conciliation  Committee  was  set  up  to  pro- 
tect party  members'  rights  and  to  ensure  that  the  actions  of  na- 
tional and  local  party  organs  conformed  to  the  HSP's  bylaws.  The 
Central  Financial  Committee  was  established  to  manage  the  party's 
finances  and  property. 

At  the  bottom  of  the  HSP's  organizational  pyramid  were  the 
basic  organizations,  which  required  a  minimum  of  three  members. 
Local  organizations  were  to  be  set  up  in  election  districts  through- 
out the  country.  Regional  party  organs  were  to  be  established  at 
the  county  level  and  in  Budapest.  According  to  the  bylaws,  these 
party  organs  were  independent  of  the  national  organization.  They 
were  to  decide  on  their  own  which  candidates  to  nominate  for  elec- 
tion to  local  representative  bodies  within  their  jurisdictions,  and 


xli 


they  could  nominate  candidates  from  their  jurisdictions  for  elec- 
tion to  the  National  Assembly. 

At  the  Fourteenth  Party  Congress,  the  leadership  gave  each 
HSWP  member  until  October  31,  1989,  to  decide  whether  or  not 
to  accept  membership  in  the  new  party.  The  HSWP's  member- 
ship had  declined  throughout  1989.  In  mid- 1988  the  HSWP  had 
approximately  817,000  members;  by  September  1989,  its  mem- 
bership stood  at  725,000.  However,  relatively  few  members  of  the 
old  party  decided  to  join  the  new  organization.  As  a  result,  the 
leadership  decided  to  extend  the  deadline  for  old  HSWP  members 
to  December  31.  As  of  mid-December,  the  HSP  claimed  about 
51,000  members. 

Reactions  of  Hungary's  opposition  groups  to  the  changes  in  the 
HSWP  were  decidedly  mixed.  The  Hungarian  Democratic  Forum 
stated  that  ''reform  of  the  ruling  party  is  a  long-awaited  and  im- 
portant event"  but  believed  that  the  party  had  failed  to  make  a 
clear  break  with  the  past.  The  Alliance  of  Free  Democrats  feared 
that  "the  setting  up  of  the  HSP  does  not  mean  genuine  change. 
The  first  resolutions  of  the  new  party  and  the  composition  of  its 
presidium  do  not  indicate,  for  the  time  being,  a  break  away  from 
its  past  as  a  state  party."  The  Social  Democratic  Party  stated  that 
it  "did  not  consider  the  new  socialist  party,  which  carries  certain 
social  democratic  features,  a  real  political  rival"  and  that  free  elec- 
tions would  show  whether  the  public  considered  the  changes  to  be 
credible. 

Conservative  party  members  decided  to  maintain  the  existence 
of  the  HSWP.  Former  General  Secretary  Karoly  Grosz  was  to  be- 
come a  member,  as  was  Janos  Berecz,  the  former  HSWP  ideology 
secretary.  The  conservatives  held  their  own  Fourteenth  Party  Con- 
gress of  the  HSWP  in  mid-December  1989.  The  HSWP  leader- 
ship dedicated  itself  to  creating  a  "unified  Marxist  party  of  workers, 
peasants,  and  intellectuals"  to  retain  the  achievements  of  the  past 
four  decades,  to  overcome  the  country's  "stifling  crisis,"  and  to 
find  paths  leading  to  the  realization  of  socialist  ideals. 

Shortly  after  the  HSP  congress,  the  National  Assembly  took  ac- 
tion on  three  measures  that  were  the  subject  of  the  November  26 
referendum  called  for  by  the  Alliance  of  Free  Democrats  and  the 
Federation  of  Young  Democrats.  In  a  session  on  October  17-18, 
the  National  Assembly  voted  to  ban  all  party  organizations  from 
the  workplace.  At  the  same  session,  the  legislature  passed  a  law 
on  political  parties,  which  called  for  redistribution  of  some  of  the 
HSP's  assets  to  other  political  parties  and  the  selling  off  of  other 
party  assets  to  help  finance  the  government's  health  and  educa- 
tion systems.  Finally,  on  October  20  the  National  Assembly 


xlii 


disbanded  the  Workers'  Guard,  without  naming  a  successor  or- 
ganization. 

In  October  the  National  Assembly  also  passed  a  number  of  other 
measures  that  would  have  a  significant  impact  on  Hungary's  po- 
litical future.  The  country's  name  was  changed  to  the  Republic 
of  Hungary.  A  new  amendment  to  the  Constitution  vested  legis- 
lative power  solely  in  the  National  Assembly,  which  henceforth 
would  have  the  power  to  draft  and  enact  laws,  confirm  the  govern- 
ment, and  pass  a  budget.  A  second  new  amendment  abolished  the 
Presidential  Council  and  in  its  place  established  the  presidency. 
The  president  of  the  republic,  who  was  given  a  term  of  office  of 
four  years,  was  granted  extensive  powers:  to  serve  as  commander 
in  chief  of  the  armed  forces;  to  declare  war  or  a  state  of  emergency 
if  the  National  Assembly  were  prevented  from  doing  so;  to  represent 
Hungary  in  foreign  relations;  to  sign  international  agreements;  and 
to  nominate  the  president  of  the  Supreme  Court  (who  then  required 
confirmation  by  the  National  Assembly). 

A  third  amendment  created  the  Constitutional  Court  to  review 
the  constitutionality  of  laws.  It  was  to  have  power  to  annul  laws 
deemed  unconstitutional.  Individuals  and  institutions  could  turn 
to  the  court  with  grievances  against  the  state.  The  Constitutional 
Court  consisted  of  fifteen  judges,  who  were  to  be  nominated  by 
a  committee  of  the  National  Assembly  made  up  of  representatives 
of  various  parties  and  then  confirmed  by  the  whole  National  As- 
sembly. 

Yet  another  amendment  stated  that  "the  Hungarian  Republic 
recognizes  the  inalienable  and  inviolable  rights  of  man"  and  that 
the  state's  foremost  duty  is  to  protect  those  rights.  The  Constitu- 
tion explicitiy  endorsed  the  freedoms  of  speech,  press,  and  assembly. 

Finally,  an  amendment  on  the  economic  system  defined  it  as  "a 
market  economy  that  also  makes  use  of  the  advantages  of  economic 
planning,  and  in  which  public  and  private  property  are  equal  and 
receive  equal  protection."  More  detailed  legislation  that  would 
transform  the  economy  from  a  command  system  to  a  market-based 
system  was  to  be  dealt  with  later. 

Other  laws  concerned  the  election  system.  A  party  assets  law 
stipulated  that  party  assets  must  be  paid  for  exclusively  through 
membership  fees,  state  support,  and  after- tax  profits  of  companies 
and  limited  companies  founded  by  the  parties.  All  parties  repre- 
sented in  the  National  Assembly  were  to  be  entitled  to  state  budget 
support:  25  percent  of  the  funds  were  to  be  shared  equally,  while 
75  percent  of  the  funds  were  to  be  divided  according  to  the  num- 
ber of  seats  held  by  each  party.  The  amount  of  funds  would  be 
determined  by  the  availability  of  money  in  the  budget. 


xliii 


According  to  the  new  electoral  law,  the  National  Assembly  to 
be  elected  in  1990  will  have  386  members  chosen  in  a  two-part  secret 
ballot.  One  ballot  will  elect  176  deputies  from  individual  electoral 
districts  each  having  about  350,000  people.  Parties  and  individuals 
nominate  candidates  for  these  seats.  If  no  candidate  wins  a  majority 
in  a  given  district,  a  second  round  of  balloting  is  held.  Those  par- 
ties that  are  able  to  enter  candidates  in  at  least  25  percent  of  the 
electoral  districts  in  a  given  county  (and  in  Budapest,  which  has 
the  status  of  a  county)  can  nominate  a  party  list  for  that  county 
(or  for  Budapest).  In  the  second  ballot,  voters  will  choose  a  party 
as  such,  that  is,  they  will  cast  a  ballot  for  one  of  the  county-level 
lists,  from  which  another  152  deputies  will  be  elected.  Parties  that 
are  able  to  put  forward  seven  or  more  of  these  lists  or  that  win  66 
percent  of  the  vote  for  the  county-level  list  in  any  given  county 
can  enter  a  slate  for  the  national  list  of  deputies.  Fifty-eight  deputies 
will  be  named  from  the  national  list;  seats  will  be  distributed  in 
proportion  to  the  total  number  of  votes  secured  by  losing  parties 
on  the  county-level  ballot.  However,  those  parties  that  fail  to  win 
at  least  4  percent  of  the  votes  cast  for  the  county-level  lists  will  not 
qualify  for  party  representation  in  the  National  Assembly,  although 
their  individual  members  could  win  seats  in  the  district-level 
elections. 

Approximately  one  month  after  the  National  Assembly  enacted 
these  momentous  changes,  the  national  referendum  called  for  by 
the  Alliance  of  Free  Democrats  and  the  Federation  of  Young 
Democrats  was  held.  The  questions  on  the  removal  of  the  HSP 
from  the  workplace,  the  nature  of  the  HSP's  assets,  and  the  dis- 
banding of  the  Workers'  Guard  were  moot  at  this  point  because 
the  National  Assembly  had  already  passed  laws  resolving  these 
issues.  However,  50.1  percent  of  those  who  voted  supported  the 
proposition  that  the  presidential  election  should  take  place  after  the 
elections  to  the  National  Assembly.  Subsequently,  district  elections 
to  the  National  Assembly  were  set  for  March  25,  1990. 

Hungary's  political  transformation  during  1989  was  reflected  in 
military  and  foreign  policy  developments.  In  May  Hungary  re- 
moved the  barbed  wire  fence  that  marked  the  border  with  Aus- 
tria. In  September  Hungary  proposed  establishment  of  a  border 
security  zone  with  Austria  and  Yugoslavia,  as  well  as  a  number 
of  steps  to  reduce  its  military  presence  along  the  borders  with  these 
two  countries.  Specifically,  the  proposal  called  for  a  fifty-kilometer- 
wide  "confidence  building  zone"  on  either  side  of  the  boundaries 
with  Austria  and  Yugoslavia.  The  number  of  tanks  in  these  areas 
would  be  halved,  and  Austria  and  Yugoslavia  would  be  given  de- 
tails of  Hungary's  deployments.  Military  exercises  would  be 


xliv 


curtailed,  and  the  Austrians  and  Yugoslavs  would  be  invited  to 
observe  any  exercises  that  were  held. 

The  budget  deficit  led  to  defense  budget  cuts.  In  1990  the  mili- 
tary budget  was  to  be  reduced  by  30  percent  compared  with  1989. 
In  addition,  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs — responsible  for  the 
police  and  the  Border  Guards — was  to  have  a  1990  budget  of  900 
million  forints  less  than  it  asked  for.  Armed  forces  were  to  be 
reduced  from  about  100,000  troops  to  less  than  80,000  troops  by 
1991.  Also  beginning  in  1991,  military  service  was  to  be  cut  from 
eighteen  months  to  one  year.  HSP  organizations  were  withdraw- 
ing from  the  armed  forces  and  attempting  to  set  up  organizations 
in  residential  areas. 

These  budget  cuts  and  reductions  in  force  levels  were  accompa- 
nied by  the  reorganization  of  the  Ministry  of  Defense.  First,  the 
Main  Political  Administration  (see  Glossary),  which  supervised  po- 
litical and  ideological  work  in  the  military,  was  disbanded.  New 
education  officers  were  to  work  side  by  side  with  commanders  and 
to  train  soldiers  in  civics  and  educate  them  about  social  policy 
problems.  Second,  some  of  the  functions  of  the  Ministry  of  Defense 
were  transferred  to  the  new  "Command  of  the  Hungarian  Peo- 
ple's Army,"  which  was  to  assume  responsibility  for  actual  mili- 
tary assignments.  A  smaller  Ministry  of  Defense  continued  to 
function,  but  it  had  responsibility  for  military  policy  and  other  ad- 
ministrative and  theoretical  matters  only.  The  minister  of  defense 
was  accountable  to  the  prime  minister,  and  the  commander  of  the 
Hungarian  People's  Army  was  responsible  to  the  president,  who 
was  commander  in  chief  of  the  armed  forces. 

On  February  2,  1990,  following  talks  between  the  Soviet  Union 
and  Hungary,  Moscow  agreed  to  withdraw  all  of  its  troops  from 
Hungary.  The  communique  that  resulted  from  the  talks  stated  that 
the  two  sides  "agreed  that  the  withdrawal  of  Soviet  troops  will  be 
carried  out  on  the  basis  of  an  intergovernmental  agreement  to  be 
concluded  within  the  shortest  possible  time."  On  March  10,  1990, 
Budapest  and  Moscow  signed  an  agreement  for  the  withdrawal  of 
all  Soviet  forces  from  Hungary  by  June  30,  1991 .  The  withdrawal 
began  on  March  11,  1990,  and  two-thirds  of  Soviet  troops  and 
equipment  were  to  be  removed  by  the  end  of  1990. 

In  foreign  policy,  Hungary  continued  to  adhere  to  its  semi- 
independent  stance  within  the  Warsaw  Pact.  In  the  early  1980s, 
Hungary  had  attempted  to  halt  the  deterioration  of  relations  be- 
tween East  and  West  by  seeking  constructive  relations  with  the  lead- 
ing states  of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO). 
Hungary  also  attempted  to  develop  relations  with  some  states  con- 
sidered pariahs  by  other  members  of  the  Warsaw  Pact,  notably  the 


xlv 


Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea)  and  Israel,  both  of  which  it  recog- 
nized in  1989.  Moreover,  in  the  late  1980s  the  Soviet  Union  also 
liberalized  many  of  its  own  foreign  policy  positions  in  an  effort  to 
resolve  a  number  of  disagreements  with  Western  countries  and  to 
seek  help  for  its  ailing  economy.  As  part  of  this  approach,  Moscow 
allowed  its  East  European  allies  much  more  leeway  in  foreign  policy 
than  it  had  in  the  past.  Hungary  managed  to  take  great  advantage 
of  this  new  Soviet  approach. 

One  of  the  most  significant  foreign  policy  events  of  the  late  1980s 
was  the  visit  of  United  States  president  George  Bush  to  Hungary 
from  July  11  to  13,  1989.  President  Bush  gave  moral  and  material 
support  to  Hungary's  reform  efforts.  Four  agreements  resulted  from 
Bush's  visit:  the  Hungarian  airline  MALEV  won  approval  to  fly 
into  and  out  of  Los  Angeles  and  Chicago;  Hungary  gained  per- 
mission to  open  a  consular  office  on  the  West  Coast  of  the  United 
States;  the  two  countries  signed  an  agreement  on  agricultural 
cooperation;  and  the  two  countries  signed  an  agreement  for  a 
US$750,000  study  by  the  University  of  Pittsburgh  of  the  financial 
operations  of  Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen  County  and  its  outdated 
steelworks. 

President  Bush  also  agreed  to  ask  other  Western  countries  to  help 
Hungary  and  to  request  that  the  United  States  Congress  make 
money  available  to  assist  the  private  sector  in  Hungary.  The  ser- 
vices of  the  United  States  Peace  Corps  were  also  to  be  made  avail- 
able to  Hungary.  Perhaps  most  important  for  Budapest,  President 
Bush  said  he  would  ask  Congress  to  give  most-favored-nation  sta- 
tus to  Hungary  on  a  permanent  rather  than  on  a  yearly  basis.  On 
October  27,  the  president  announced  that  Hungary  would  be  per- 
petually granted  most-favored-nation  status. 

Relations  with  the  Soviet  Union  continued  to  prosper,  as  they 
had  since  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev  became  Soviet  leader  in  March 
1985.  Significantly,  in  1989  Budapest  and  Moscow  agreed  to  switch 
to  dollar- accounted  trade  beginning  in  1991.  Hungary  was  to  pay 
the  Soviet  Union  for  its  energy  and  raw  materials  using  dollars 
and  applying  current  Western  price  rates.  Hungary  was  to  receive 
hard  currency  for  its  manufactures  sold  to  the  Soviet  Union.  Hun- 
gary would  have  to  compete  with  Western  firms  for  the  Soviet  mar- 
ket, but  Hungary's  leaders  believed  that  such  competition  would 
help  bring  their  country's  industry  up  to  world  standards. 

The  move  to  trade  in  hard  currency  with  the  Soviet  Union  was 
expected  to  resolve  the  problem  of  Hungary's  huge  trade  surplus 
with  that  country.  In  the  first  half  of  1989,  the  surplus  amounted 
to  800  million  rubles.  These  rubles  were  not  a  convertible  currency 
and  therefore  were  of  little  use  to  Hungary.  The  surplus  amounted 


xlvi 


to  an  interest-free  loan  to  the  Soviet  Union,  and  the  Hungarian 
economy  could  not  afford  this  burden. 

Hungary  had  more  serious  problems  with  three  other  Warsaw 
Pact  allies — East  Germany,  Czechoslovakia,  and  Romania.  East 
Germans  traveling  or  vacationing  in  Hungary  used  Hungary's  open 
border  with  Austria  to  flee  to  that  country  en  route  to  West  Ger- 
many. East  Berlin  had  vociferously  protested  the  Hungarian  deci- 
sion to  allow  the  East  Germans  to  leave  for  Austria.  The  official 
East  German  news  agency  called  the  decision  "an  organized  trade 
in  humans  under  the  pretense  of  humanitarian  considerations." 
However,  after  the  emergence  of  a  reform  government  in  East  Ger- 
many and  the  opening  of  the  Berlin  Wall  in  early  November  1989, 
relations  between  the  two  countries  warmed  considerably. 

Relations  with  Czechoslovakia  became  problematic  when  Hun- 
gary suspended  work  on  the  Gabokovo-Nagymaros  Dam  project 
on  May  1 3 .  The  Hungarian  government  took  this  action  in  response 
to  public  protests  over  the  environmental  damage  caused  by  the 
project  and  in  light  of  a  recommendation  by  a  panel  of  experts  that 
the  project  be  abandoned.  In  turn,  Czechoslovakia  charged  that 
Hungary's  suspension  of  the  project  was  politically  motivated  and 
a  violation  of  international  law.  On  November  15,  Hungary  an- 
nounced that  the  Nagymaros  section  of  the  dam  "will  not  be  built." 
The  new  reform  government  that  took  power  in  Czechoslovakia 
in  late  1989  was  drafting  plans  to  suspend  and  halt  its  part  of  the 
project,  which  had  also  raised  environmental  concerns  in  that 
country. 

Until  the  overthrow  of  Romanian  leader  Nicolae  Ceau§escu  in 
late  December  1989,  Hungary's  relations  with  Romania  had 
progressively  worsened  over  the  course  of  the  year.  The  number 
of  refugees  from  Romania  who  settled  in  Hungary  steadily  increased 
in  1989,  and,  significantly,  the  number  of  ethnic  Romanians  among 
the  refugees  rose  to  about  20  percent  of  the  total. 

In  an  attempt  to  resolve  outstanding  problems  between  the  two 
countries,  Rezso  Nyers,  together  with  Foreign  Minister  Gyula  Horn 
and  Prime  Minister  Miklos  Nemeth,  met  Ceau§escu  in  Bucharest 
on  July  8.  The  Hungarians  sought  a  radical  improvement  in  the 
treatment  of  ethnic  Hungarians  in  Romania — the  most  important 
source  of  friction  between  Budapest  and  Bucharest.  The  Hungar- 
ians rejected  Ceausescu's  claim  that  the  nationality  issue  was  strictly 
Romania's  internal  affair.  The  Hungarian  delegation  also  called 
for  easing  travel  restrictions  between  the  two  countries  and  appealed 
for  a  halt  to  Ceau§escu's  plan  to  raze  7,000  to  8,000  villages  and 
relocate  their  inhabitants  in  large  apartment  complexes.  The 


xlvii 


meeting  produced  no  result,  as  Ceausescu  again  expressed  the  view 
that  he  had  ''solved"  all  nationality  problems  in  his  country. 

The  Romanian  government's  threats  to  the  lives  of  Laszlo  Tokes, 
an  ethnic  Hungarian  Reformed  minister  in  Timi§oara,  Romania, 
and  his  family  initiated  the  revolution  in  Romania  that  brought 
Ceau§escu's  ouster  and  execution  in  December  1989.  In  response 
to  the  violence  perpetrated  by  the  Ceau§escu  regime  on  its  citizens 
in  an  effort  to  stem  the  popular  revolt,  the  Hungarian  government 
took  several  measures.  Hungary  called  on  the  United  Nations  Secu- 
rity Council  to  involve  itself  in  the  Romanian  affair.  Hungary  can- 
celed the  1948  Treaty  of  Friendship  and  Cooperation  between  the 
two  countries.  Hungary  also  closed  the  border  between  Hungary 
and  Romania  and  formally  protested  the  events  in  Romania  to 
Romanian  representatives  in  Hungary. 

As  fighting  broke  out  between  the  Romanian  army,  which  was 
supporting  the  revolutionary  Council  of  National  Salvation  Front, 
and  Ceau§escu's  secret  police  organization — the  Securitate — 
Hungary  extended  support  to  the  new  regime  in  Romania.  Hun- 
gary was  the  first  foreign  government  to  recognize  the  Council  of 
National  Salvation  Front  as  the  legitimate  government  of  Roma- 
nia. The  Hungarian  army  maintained  constant  contact  with  the 
Romanian  army.  The  radio  locator  units  of  the  Hungarian  army 
established  the  locations  of  several  secret  Securitate  radio  trans- 
mitters and  relayed  that  information  to  the  Romanian  military 
leadership.  The  Hungarians  offered  ammunition  to  the  Romanian 
army,  but  that  offer  was  turned  down.  Finally,  both  the  Hungar- 
ian government  and  private  citizens  and  political  parties  proffered 
food  and  medical  aid  to  the  beleaguered  Romanians. 

The  revolution  in  Romania  promised  an  immediate  improve- 
ment in  relations  between  Budapest  and  Bucharest.  The  new  Roma- 
nian government  ended  the  Ceau§escu  regime's  harsh  measures 
against  its  population,  including  the  notorious  resettlement  pro- 
gram. The  two  governments  agreed  to  reopen  consulates  in  the 
Romanian  city  of  Cluj  and  the  Hungarian  city  of  Debrecen  and 
to  open  cultural  institutes  in  Budapest  and  Bucharest. 

As  this  account  shows,  in  1989  and  early  1990  Hungary  had  ex- 
perienced a  dizzying  series  of  political  changes.  Noncommunist  po- 
litical parties  were  poised  to  assume  political  power.  A  number  of 
significant  steps  had  been  taken  to  establish  the  rule  of  law  in  Hun- 
gary, although  the  opposition  parties  made  it  clear  that  this  process 
had  only  just  begun.  The  communist  party — in  whatever  acronymic 
guise — was  dwindling  in  importance.  Soviet  troops  were  beginning 
their  withdrawal  from  Hungary.  The  government  was  pressing 
toward  Hungary's  opening  to  the  noncommunist  world  with  vigor 


xlviii 


and  determination.  Hungary  was  indeed  in  the  throes  of  a  revolu- 
tion, albeit  a  peaceful  one,  accompanied  by  its  Central  European 
neighbors  on  the  road  to  a  new  political  future. 

March  13,  1990

On  March  25,  1990,  round  one  of  the  first  free  parliamentary 
elections  in  forty-three  years  took  place  in  Hungary.  In  the  152 
district  elections,  only  five  candidates  succeeded  in  winning  a 
majority.  Among  the  winners  was  former  Prime  Minister  Miklos 
Nemeth,  who  ran  as  an  independent.  Runoff  elections  on  April  8 
were  to  decide  the  outcome  of  the  other  147  district  races. 

In  balloting  for  the  county-level  lists,  the  Hungarian  Democratic 
Forum  gained  24.7  percent  of  the  vote,  which  translated  into  40 
seats  in  the  National  Assembly.  The  Alliance  of  Free  Democrats 
won  21 .39  percent  of  the  vote  for  thirty-four  seats,  and  the  Indepen- 
dent Smallholders'  Party  1 1 .73  percent  for  sixteen  seats.  Other  par- 
ties winning  the  necessary  4  percent  threshold  for  representation 
in  the  National  Assembly  were  the  Hungarian  Socialist  Party  with 
10.89  percent  of  the  vote,  the  Federation  of  Young  Democrats  with 
8.95  percent  of  the  vote,  and  the  Christian  Democratic  People's 
Party  with  6.46  percent  of  the  vote.  Among  the  many  parties  fail- 
ing to  reach  the  required  threshold  were  the  Social  Democratic  Party 
and  the  Hungarian  Socialist  Workers'  Party. 

The  Hungarian  Democratic  Forum  emerged  as  the  clear  win- 
ner after  the  second  round  of  elections  held  on  April  8  in  those 
electoral  districts  where  no  candidate  gained  a  majority  in  the  first 
round  of  voting.  The  forum  gained  a  total  of  164  seats  in  the  Na- 
tional Assembly  in  the  two  rounds  of  voting.  Second  was  the  Alli- 
ance of  Free  Democrats  with  ninety-two  seats.  The  Hungarian 
Democratic  Forum  chose  to  form  a  government  together  with  the 
Independent  Smallholders'  Party,  which  won  forty-four  seats,  and 
the  Christian  Democratic  People's  Party,  which  won  twenty-one 
seats.  Hence,  the  governing  coalition  held  229  seats  at  about  60 
percent  of  the  394  total.  (On  March  1 ,  the  National  Assembly  had 
added  8  seats  to  its  previous  total  of  386,  1  each  for  the  country's 
Gypsy,  Croatian,  Serbian,  Romanian,  Slovak,  Slovenian,  German, 
and  Jewish  minorities.  Nominations  for  these  seats  were  to  be  pre- 
pared by  an  interparty  committee  within  the  National  Assembly 
or  by  the  National  Assembly  as  a  whole.) 

The  new  National  Assembly  convened  for  the  first  time  on 
May  2,  1990.  At  that  meeting,  it  elected  Arpad  Goncz,  a  writer 


xlix 


jailed  for  six  years  following  the  Revolution  of  1956,  as  president 
of  the  National  Assembly,  which  made  him  interim  president  of 
the  republic.  Goncz  was  actually  a  founder  of  the  Alliance  of  Free 
Democrats.  In  return  for  the  Hungarian  Democratic  Forum's  sup- 
port for  Goncz,  the  Alliance  of  Free  Democrats  agreed  to  support 
a  series  of  amendments  to  the  Constitution  that  were  to  secure  the 
establishment  of  "an  independent  democratic  constitutional  state" 
in  Hungary  and  provide  the  legal  basis  for  a  market  economy. 
Another  amendment  agreed  to  by  the  two  parties  would  require 
only  a  simple  majority  in  the  National  Assembly  to  approve  legis- 
lation for  all  matters  except  those  of  the  highest  political  impor- 
tance (such  matters  included  a  law  on  referendums,  a  nationalities 
law,  a  citizenship  law,  legal  provisions  concerning  the  freedom  of 
conscience  and  religion,  and  other  issues).  The  two  parties  also 
agreed  to  an  amendment  according  to  which  the  president  would 
be  elected  to  a  four-year  term  by  the  National  Assembly  rather  than 
be  elected  by  the  population  as  a  whole.  Yet  another  amendment 
would  change  the  method  for  the  representation  of  national  minori- 
ties in  the  government  and  in  the  National  Assembly. 

On  May  23,  1990,  Jozsef  Antall  of  the  Hungarian  Democratic 
Forum  became  the  prime  minister.  Other  government  ministers 
included  Balazs  Horvath  of  the  Hungarian  Democratic  Forum,  who 
became  minister  of  the  interior;  Ferenc  Jozsef  Nagy  of  the  Indepen- 
dent Smallholders'  Party,  who  became  minister  of  agriculture;  Lajos 
Fur  of  the  Hungarian  Democratic  Forum,  who  became  minister 
of  defense;  Geza  Jeszenszky  of  the  Hungarian  Democratic  Forum, 
who  became  minister  of  foreign  affairs;  and  Peter  Akos  Bod  of  the 
Hungarian  Democratic  Forum,  who  became  minister  of  trade  and 
industry. 

The  elections  and  the  formation  of  a  new  noncommunist  govern- 
ment took  place  against  the  backdrop  of  crisis  situations  in  the  econ- 
omy and  in  foreign  relations  with  Romania.  In  January  1990,  prices 
of  meat,  poultry,  flour,  milk  and  other  dairy  products,  and  cook- 
ing fat  and  oil  rose  an  average  of  32  percent;  car  prices  rose  25 
percent;  and  prices  of  beer,  cigarettes,  and  gasoline  also  rose.  On 
February  1 ,  rents  for  state-owned  apartments  increased  an  aver- 
age of  35  percent,  while  bus  and  train  fares  rose  45  percent,  and 
railroad  fares  rose  20  percent.  The  drastic  price  increases  resulted 
from  a  reduction  in  government  spending  to  reduce  the  budget 
deficit  from  50  billion  forints  in  1989  to  10  billion  forints  in  1990. 
To  meet  this  objective,  the  government  cut  many  price  subsidies 
and  decontrolled  most  producer  prices. 

On  March  18  and  19,  severe  anti-Hungarian  violence  erupted 
in  the  Romanian  town  of  Tirgu  Mure§.  In  the  clashes  between 


1 


Romanians  and  Hungarians,  3  people  died  and  269  were  injured. 
This  violence  led  to  a  rapid  deterioration  of  relations  between  Hun- 
gary and  Romania.  Prime  Minister  Miklos  Nemeth  addressed  a 
note  of  protest  to  Romanian  Prime  Minister  Petre  Roman.  Hun- 
garian Foreign  Minister  Gyula  Horn  addressed  a  letter  to  United 
Nations  Secretary  General  Xavier  Peres  de  Cuellar  and  to  Jan 
Martenson,  head  of  the  UN  Human  Rights  Committee,  asking 
that  the  committee  mediate  the  dispute  without  delay.  For  its  part, 
the  Romanian  government  responded  by  holding  the  Hungarian 
government  responsible  for  the  bloodshed  in  Tirgu  Mure§,  and 
called  upon  Hungary  to  refrain  from  interfering  in  Romania's  in- 
ternal affairs.  In  response  to  these  charges,  the  Hungarian  govern- 
ment stated  that  accusations  of  Hungarian  interference  were 
unfounded,  and  that  the  source  of  the  tragic  events  lay  in  the  Roma- 
nian government's  hesitancy  to  take  resolute  action  to  stem  the  rise 
of  national  chauvinism  in  Romania.  The  Hungarian  government 
called  for  talks  between  the  two  governments  on  all  issues  as  a  means 
to  reduce  tension.

Chapter  1.  Historical  Setting 


Refugee  writing  a  letter,  Esztergom,  1916 


THE  HUNGARIAN  PEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC  emerged  in  1949 
after  the  Hungarian  Workers'  Party  eliminated  its  rivals  and  as- 
sumed control  of  the  state.  Soviet  control  of  Eastern  Europe  after 
World  War  II  had  enabled  a  minuscule  communist  party  lacking 
popular  support  to  gain  power  in  the  country  and  gradually 
eliminate  its  political  rivals.  Under  Matyas  Rakosi,  the  party  con- 
solidated its  control  and  radically  transformed  the  country  econom- 
ically, socially,  and  politically. 

In  the  mid-1950s,  after  the  Soviet  Union  had  somewhat  relaxed 
its  control  of  Eastern  Europe,  Hungarian  society  began  to  mobi- 
lize against  the  regime,  culminating  in  the  Revolution  of  1956. 
Soviet  troops  crushed  the  rebellion,  leaving  power  in  the  hands  of 
Janos  Kadar.  After  consolidating  his  authority,  Kadar  embarked 
on  a  program  of  economic  reform  in  the  mid-1960s. 

Like  other  countries  of  Eastern  Europe,  Hungary  has  a  history 
of  class,  religious,  and  ethnic  conflicts  that  were  intensified  and 
sometimes  decided  by  the  actions  of  larger,  more  powerful  neigh- 
bors. Beginning  in  the  tenth  century,  German  and  Bohemian  mis- 
sionaries converted  the  Magyars.  In  the  early  eleventh  century, 
Bavarian  knights  helped  Stephen  I  eliminate  rivals  and  quash 
peasant  revolts.  Siileyman  the  Magnificent 's  Ottoman  armies  con- 
quered and  partitioned  the  country  with  the  Habsburgs  in  the  six- 
teenth century,  expediting  the  spread  of  Protestant  faiths.  Habsburg 
rulers  colonized  Hungary  with  non-Magyars,  repressed  its  Pro- 
testants, stifled  its  economic  development,  and  attempted  to  Ger- 
manize its  people.  The  Entente  powers  carved  up  Hungary  after 
World  War  I  and  distributed  most  of  the  land  to  new  nation- states. 
Finally,  dictator  Joseph  Stalin  enforced  Soviet  domination  over  post- 
war Hungary. 

Despite  internal  divisions,  strong  foreign  influence,  and  outright 
attempts  to  force  the  Hungarians  to  assimilate  into  other  cultures, 
Hungarian  nationalism  has  thrived  throughout  the  nineteenth  and 
twentieth  centuries.  Nationalism  drove  Hungary  to  ally  itself  with 
Nazi  Germany  to  regain  territories  lost  after  World  War  I.  Na- 
tionalism also  inspired  Hungarians  to  revolt  against  the  Stalinist 
political  order  in  October  1956. 

Early  History 

The  Hungarian  nation  traces  its  history  to  the  Magyars,  a  pagan 
Finno-Ugric  tribe  that  arose  in  central  Russia  and  spoke  a  language

Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

that  evolved  into  modern  Hungarian.  Historians  dispute  the  exact 
location  of  the  early  Magyars'  original  homeland,  but  it  is  likely 
to  be  an  area  between  the  Volga  River  and  the  Ural  Mountains. 
In  ancient  times,  the  Magyars  probably  lived  as  nomadic  tent- 
dwelling  hunters  and  fishers.  Some  scholars  argue  that  they  en- 
gaged in  agriculture  beginning  in  the  second  millennium  B.C. 

Before  the  fifth  century  A.D.,  the  Magyars'  ancestors  gradually 
migrated  southward  onto  the  Russian  steppes,  where  they  wan- 
dered into  the  lands  near  the  Volga  River  bend,  at  present-day 
Kazan',  as  nomadic  herders.  Later,  probably  under  pressure  from 
hostile  tribes  to  the  east,  they  migrated  to  the  area  between  the 
Don  and  lower  Dnepr  rivers.  There  they  lived  close  to,  and  perhaps 
were  dominated  by,  the  Bui  gar-Turks  from  about  the  fifth  to  the 
seventh  century.  During  this  period,  the  Magyars  became  a  semi- 
sedentary  people  who  lived  by  raising  catde  and  sheep,  planting 
crops,  and  fishing.  The  Bulgar-Turkish  influence  on  the  Magyars 
was  significant,  especially  in  agriculture.  Most  Hungarian  words 
dealing  with  agriculture  and  animal  husbandry  have  Turkic  roots. 
By  contrast,  the  etymology  of  the  word  Hungary  has  been  traced 
to  a  Slavicized  form  of  the  Turkic  words  on  ogur,  meaning  '  'ten 
arrows,"  which  may  have  referred  to  the  number  of  Magyar  tribes. 

The  Magyars  lived  on  lands  controlled  by  the  Khazars  (a  Turkish 
people  whose  realm  stretched  from  the  lower  Volga  and  the 
lower  Don  rivers  to  the  Caucasus)  from  about  the  seventh  to  the 
ninth  century,  when  they  freed  themselves  from  Khazar  rule.  The 
Khazars  attempted  to  reconquer  the  Magyars  both  by  themselves 
and  with  the  help  of  the  Pechenegs,  another  Turkish  tribe.  This 
tribe  drove  the  Magyars  from  their  homes  westward  to  lands  be- 
tween the  Dnepr  and  lower  Danube  rivers  in  889.  In  895  the 
Magyars  joined  Byzantine  armies  under  Emperor  Leo  VI  in  a  war 
against  the  Bulgars.  However,  the  Bulgars  emerged  victorious. 
Their  allies,  the  Pechenegs,  attacked  the  weakened  Magyars  and 
forced  them  westward  yet  again  in  895  or  896.  This  migration  took 
the  Magyars  over  the  Carpathian  Mountains  and  into  the  basin 
drained  by  the  Danube  and  Tisza  rivers,  a  region  that  corresponds 
roughly  to  present-day  Hungary.  Romans,  Goths,  Huns,  Slavs, 
and  other  peoples  had  previously  occupied  the  region,  but  at  the 
time  of  the  Magyar  migration,  the  land  was  inhabited  only  by  a 
sparse  population  of  Slavs,  numbering  about  200,000. 

Tradition  holds  that  the  Magyar  clan  chiefs  chose  a  chieftain 
named  Arpad  to  lead  the  migration  and  that  they  swore  by  sip- 
ping from  a  cup  of  their  commingled  blood  to  accept  Arpad' s  male 
descendants  as  the  Magyars'  hereditary  chieftains.  The  Magyars 
probably  knew  of  the  lands  in  the  Carpathian  Basin  because  from

Historical  Setting 


892  to  894  Magyar  mercenaries  had  fought  there  for  King  Arnulph 
of  East  Francia  in  a  struggle  with  the  king  of  Moravia.  Estimates 
are  that  about  400,000  people  made  up  the  exodus,  in  seven 
Magyar,  one  Kabar,  and  other  smaller  tribes. 

The  Carpathian  Basin  and  parts  of  Transylvania  south- southwest 
of  the  basin  had  been  settled  for  thousands  of  years  before  the 
Magyars'  arrival.  A  rich  Bronze  Age  culture  thrived  there  until 
horsemen  from  the  steppes  destroyed  it  in  the  middle  of  the  thir- 
teenth century  B.C.  Celts  later  occupied  parts  of  the  land,  and  in 
the  first  century  A.D.  the  Romans  conquered  and  divided  it  be- 
tween the  imperial  provinces  of  Pannonia  and  Dacia.  In  the  fourth 
century,  the  Goths  ousted  the  Romans,  and  Attila  the  Hun  later 
made  the  Carpathian  Basin  the  hub  of  his  short-lived  empire.  There- 
after, Avars,  Bulgars,  Germans,  and  Slavs  settled  the  region.  In 
the  late  ninth  century  A.D. ,  only  scattered  settlements  of  Slavs  oc- 
cupied the  Carpathian  Basin.  The  Magyar  forces,  light  cavalry- 
men who  used  Central  Asian- style  bows,  quickly  conquered  the 
Slavs,  whom  they  either  assimilated  or  enslaved. 

Romanian  and  Hungarian  historians  disagree  about  the  ethnicity 
of  Transylvania's  population  before  the  Magyars'  arrival.  The 
Romanians  establish  their  claims  to  Transylvania  by  arguing  that 
their  Latin  ancestors  inhabited  Transylvania  and  survived  there 
through  the  Dark  Ages.  The  Hungarians,  by  contrast,  maintain 
that  Transylvania  was  inhabited  not  by  the  ancestors  of  the  Roma- 
nians but  by  Slavs  and  point  out  that  the  first  mention  of  the  Roma- 
nians' ancestors  in  Hungarian  records,  which  appeared  in  the 
thirteenth  century,  described  them  as  drifting  herders. 

Medieval  Period 

In  the  four  centuries  after  their  migration  into  the  Carpathian 
Basin,  the  Magyars  gradually  developed  from  a  loose  confedera- 
tion of  pagan  marauders  into  a  recognized  kingdom.  This  king- 
dom, which  became  known  as  Hungary,  was  led  by  the  Arpad 
Dynasty  and  was  firmly  allied  to  the  Christian  West.  Eventually 
the  Arpad  line  died  out,  however,  and  Hungary  again  descended 
into  anarchy,  with  the  most  powerful  nobles  vying  for  control. 

Christianization  of  the  Magyars 

The  bonds  linking  the  seven  Magyar  tribes  grew  frail  soon  after 
the  migration  into  the  Carpathian  Basin.  At  that  time,  Europe  was 
weak  and  disunited,  and  for  more  than  half  a  century  Magyar  bands 
raided  Bavaria,  Moravia,  Italy,  Constantinople,  and  lands  as  far 
away  as  the  Pyrenees.  Sometimes  fighting  as  mercenaries  and  some- 
times lured  by  spoils  alone,  the  Magyar  bands  looted  towns  and

took  captives  for  labor,  ransom,  or  sale  on  the  slave  market.  The 
Byzantine  emperor  and  European  princes  paid  the  Magyars  an- 
nual tribute.  In  955,  however,  German  and  Czech  armies  under 
the  Holy  Roman  Empire's  King  Otto  I  destroyed  a  Magyar  force 
near  Augsburg.  The  defeat  effectively  ended  Magyar  raids  on  the 
West,  and  in  970  the  Byzantines  halted  Magyar  incursions  toward 
the  East. 

Fearing  a  war  of  extermination,  Chieftain  Geza  (972-97),  Arpad's 
great-grandson,  assured  Otto  II  that  the  Magyars  had  ceased  their 
raids  and  asked  him  to  send  missionaries.  Otto  complied,  and  in 
975  Geza  and  a  few  of  his  kinsmen  were  baptized  into  the  Roman 
Catholic  Church.  Geza  consented  to  baptism  more  out  of  political 
necessity  than  conviction.  He  continued  to  offer  sacrifices  to  the 
pagan  gods  and  reportedly  bragged  that  he  "was  rich  enough  for 
two  gods."  From  this  time,  however,  missionaries  began  the  gradual 
process  of  converting  and  simultaneously  westernizing  the  Magyar 
tribes.  Geza  used  German  knights  and  his  position  as  chief  of  the 
Magyars'  largest  clan  to  restore  strong  central  authority  over  the 
other  clans.  Hungary's  ties  with  the  West  were  strengthened  in 
996  when  Geza's  son,  Stephen,  who  was  baptized  as  a  child  and 
educated  by  Saint  Adalbert  of  Prague,  married  Gisela,  a  Bavarian 
princess  and  sister  of  Emperor  Henry  II. 

Stephen  I 

Stephen  (997-1038)  became  chieftain  when  Geza  died,  and  he 
consolidated  his  rule  by  ousting  rival  clan  chiefs  and  confiscating 
their  lands.  Stephen  then  asked  Pope  Sylvester  II  to  recognize  him 
as  king  of  Hungary.  The  pope  agreed,  and  legend  says  Stephen 
was  crowned  on  Christmas  Day  in  the  year  1000.  The  crowning 
legitimized  Hungary  as  a  Western  kingdom  independent  of  the  Holy 
Roman  and  Byzantine  empires.  It  also  gave  Stephen  virtually  ab- 
solute power,  which  he  used  to  strengthen  the  Roman  Catholic 
Church  and  Hungary.  Stephen  ordered  the  people  to  pay  tithes 
and  required  every  tenth  village  to  construct  a  church  and  sup- 
port a  priest.  Stephen  donated  land  to  support  bishoprics  and 
monasteries,  required  all  persons  except  the  clergy  to  marry,  and 
barred  marriages  between  Christians  and  pagans.  Foreign  monks 
worked  as  teachers  and  introduced  Western  agricultural  methods. 
A  Latin  alphabet  was  devised  for  the  Magyar  (Hungarian) 
language. 

Stephen  administered  his  kingdom  through  a  system  of  coun- 
ties, each  governed  by  an  ispdn,  or  magistrate,  appointed  by  the 
king.  In  Stephen's  time,  Magyar  society  had  two  classes:  the  free- 
men nobles  and  the  unfree.  The  nobles  were  descended  in  the  male

line  from  the  Magyars  who  had  either  migrated  into  the  Carpathian 
Basin  or  had  received  their  tide  of  nobility  from  the  king.  Only 
nobles  could  hold  office  or  present  grievances  to  the  king.  They 
paid  tithes  and  owed  the  crown  military  service  but  were  exempt 
from  taxes.  The  unfree — who  had  no  political  voice — were  slaves, 
freed  slaves,  immigrants,  or  nobles  stripped  of  their  privileges.  Most 
were  serfs  who  paid  taxes  to  the  king  and  a  part  of  each  harvest 
to  their  lord  for  use  of  his  land.  The  king  had  direct  control  of  the 
unfree,  thus  checking  the  nobles'  power. 

Clan  lands,  crown  lands,  and  former  crown  lands  made  up  the 
realm.  Clan  lands  belonged  to  nobles,  who  could  will  the  lands  to 
family  members  or  the  church;  if  a  noble  died  without  an  heir, 
his  land  reverted  to  his  clan.  Crown  lands  consisted  of  Stephen's 
patrimony,  lands  seized  from  disloyal  nobles,  conquered  lands,  and 
unoccupied  parts  of  the  kingdom.  Former  crown  lands  were  proper- 
ties granted  by  the  king  to  the  church  or  to  individuals. 

Politics  and  Society  under  Stephen's  Successors 

Stephen  died  in  1038  and  was  canonized  in  1083.  Despite  pagan 
revolts  and  a  series  of  succession  struggles  after  his  death,  Hun- 
gary grew  stronger  and  expanded  (see  fig.  2).  Transylvania  was 
conquered  and  colonized  with  Magyars,  Szekels  (a  tribe  related 
to  the  Magyars),  and  German  Saxons  in  the  eleventh  and  twelfth 
centuries.  In  1090  Laszlo  I  (1077-95)  occupied  Slavonia,  and  in 
1103  Kalman  I  (1095-1116)  assumed  the  title  of  king  of  Croatia. 
Croatia  was  never  assimilated  into  Hungary;  rather,  it  became  an 
associate  kingdom  administered  by  a  ban,  or  civil  governor. 

The  eleventh  and  twelfth  centuries  were  relatively  peaceful,  and 
Hungary  slowly  developed  a  feudal  economy.  Crop  production 
gradually  supplemented  stock  breeding,  but  until  the  twelfth  cen- 
tury planting  methods  remained  crude  because  tillers  farmed  each 
plot  until  it  was  exhausted,  then  moved  on  to  fresh  land.  Gold, 
silver,  and  salt  mining  boosted  the  king's  revenues.  Despite  the 
minting  of  coins,  catde  remained  the  principal  medium  of  exchange. 
Towns  began  developing  when  an  improvement  in  agricultural 
methods  and  the  clearing  of  additional  land  produced  enough  sur- 
plus to  support  a  class  of  full-time  craftsmen.  By  the  reign  of  Bela 
III  (1173-96),  Hungary  was  one  of  the  leading  powers  in 
southeastern  Europe,  and  in  the  thirteenth  century  Hungary's 
nobles  were  trading  gold,  silver,  copper,  and  iron  with  western 
Europe  for  luxury  goods. 

Until  the  end  of  the  twelfth  century,  the  king's  power  remained 
paramount  in  Hungary.  He  was  the  largest  landowner,  and  in- 
come from  the  crown  lands  nearly  equaled  the  revenues  generated

from  mines,  customs,  tolls,  and  the  mint.  In  the  thirteenth  cen- 
tury, however,  the  social  structure  changed,  and  the  crown's  ab- 
solute power  began  to  wane.  As  the  crown  lands  became  a  less 
important  source  of  royal  revenues,  the  king  found  it  expedient 
to  make  land  grants  to  nobles  to  ensure  their  loyalty.  King  Andrew 
II  (1205-35),  a  profligate  spender  on  foreign  military  adventures 
and  domestic  luxury,  made  huge  land  grants  to  nobles  who  fought 
for  him.  These  nobles,  many  of  whom  were  foreign  knights,  soon 
made  up  a  class  of  magnates  whose  wealth  and  power  far  outstripped 
that  of  the  more  numerous,  and  predominantly  Magyar,  lesser 
nobles.  When  Andrew  tried  to  meet  burgeoning  expenses  by  rais- 
ing the  serfs'  taxes,  thereby  indirectly  slashing  the  lesser  nobles' 
incomes,  the  lesser  nobles  rebelled.  In  1222  they  forced  Andrew 
to  sign  the  Golden  Bull,  which  limited  the  king's  power,  declared 
the  lesser  nobles  (all  free  men  not  included  among  the  great  Barons 
or  magnates)  legally  equal  to  the  magnates,  and  gave  them  the  right 
to  resist  the  king's  illegal  acts.  The  lesser  nobles  also  began  to  present 
Andrew  with  grievances,  a  practice  that  evolved  into  the  institu- 
tion of  the  parliament,  or  Diet. 

Andrew  IPs  son  Bela  IV  (1235-79)  tried  with  little  success  to 
reestablish  royal  preeminence  by  reacquiring  lost  crown  lands.  His 
efforts,  however,  created  a  deep  rift  between  the  crown  and  the 
magnates  just  as  the  Mongols  were  sweeping  westward  across  Rus- 
sia toward  Europe.  Aware  of  the  danger,  Bela  ordered  the  mag- 
nates and  lesser  nobles  to  mobilize.  Few  responded,  and  the 
Mongols  routed  Bela's  army  at  Mohi  on  April  11,  1241 .  Bela  fled 
first  to  Austria,  where  Duke  Frederick  of  Babenberg  held  him  for 
ransom,  then  to  Dalmatia.  The  Mongols  reduced  Hungary's  towns 
and  villages  to  ashes  and  slaughtered  half  the  population  before 
news  arrived  in  1242  that  the  Great  Khan  Ogotai  had  died  in 
Karakorum.  The  Mongols  withdrew,  sparing  Bela  and  what  re- 
mained of  his  kingdom. 

Reconstruction 

Bela  realized  that  reconstruction  would  require  the  magnates' 
support,  so  he  abandoned  his  attempts  to  recover  former  crown 
lands.  Instead,  he  granted  crown  lands  to  his  supporters,  reor- 
ganized the  army  by  replacing  light  archers  with  heavy  cavalry, 
and  granted  the  magnates  concessions  to  redevelop  their  lands  and 
construct  stone-and-mortar  castles  that  would  withstand  enemy 
sieges.  Bela  repopulated  the  country  with  a  wave  of  immigrants, 
transforming  royal  castles  into  towns  and  populating  them  with 
Germans,  Italians,  and  Jews.  Mining  began  anew,  farming  methods 
improved,  and  crafts  and  commerce  developed  in  the  towns.  After

Historical  Setting 


Bela's  reconstruction  program,  the  magnates,  with  their  new  for- 
tifications, emerged  as  Hungary's  most  powerful  political  force. 
However,  by  the  end  of  the  thirteenth  century,  they  were  fighting 
each  other  and  carving  out  petty  principalities. 

King  Bela  IV  died  in  1270,  and  the  Arpad  line  expired  in  1301 
when  Andrew  III,  who  strove  with  some  success  to  limit  the  mag- 
nates' power,  unexpectedly  died  without  a  male  heir.  Anarchy 
characterized  Hungary  as  factions  of  magnates  vied  for  control. 

Renaissance  and  Reformation 

After  the  Arpad  Dynasty  ended,  Hungary's  nobles  chose  a  series 
of  foreign  kings  who  reestablished  strong  royal  authority.  Hun- 
gary and  the  adjacent  countries  prospered  for  several  centuries  as 
Central  Europe  experienced  an  era  of  peace  interrupted  only  by 
succession  struggles.  But  over  time,  the  onslaughts  of  the  Turks 
and  the  strife  of  the  Reformation  weakened  Hungary,  and  the  coun- 
try was  eventually  partitioned  by  the  Turks  and  the  Habsburgs. 

Golden  Era 

Hungary's  first  two  foreign  kings,  Charles  Robert  and  Louis  I 
of  the  House  of  Anjou,  ruled  during  one  of  the  most  glorious  periods 
in  the  country's  history.  Central  Europe  was  at  peace,  and  Hun- 
gary and  its  neighbors  prospered.  Charles  Robert  (1308-42)  won 
the  protracted  succession  struggle  after  Andrew  Ill's  death.  An 
Arpad  descendant  in  the  female  line,  Charles  Robert  was  crowned 
as  a  child  and  raised  in  Hungary.  He  reestablished  the  crown's 
authority  by  ousting  disloyal  magnates  and  distributing  their  estates 
to  his  supporters.  Charles  Robert  then  ordered  the  magnates  to 
recruit  and  equip  small  private  armies  called  banderia.  Charles 
Robert  ruled  by  decree  and  convened  the  Diet  only  to  announce 
his  decisions.  Dynastic  marriages  linked  his  family  with  the  ruling 
families  of  Naples  and  Poland  and  heightened  Hungary's  stand- 
ing abroad.  Under  Charles  Robert,  the  crown  regained  control  of 
Hungary's  mines,  and  in  the  next  two  centuries  the  mines  produced 
more  than  a  third  of  Europe's  gold  and  a  quarter  of  its  silver. 
Charles  Robert  also  introduced  tax  reforms  and  a  stable  currency. 
Charles  Robert's  son  and  successor  Louis  I  (1342-82)  maintained 
the  strong  central  authority  Charles  Robert  had  amassed.  In  1351 
Louis  issued  a  decree  that  reconfirmed  the  Golden  Bull,  erased  all 
legal  distinctions  between  the  lesser  nobles  and  the  magnates,  stan- 
dardized the  serfs'  obligations,  and  barred  the  serfs  from  leaving 
the  lesser  nobles'  farms  to  seek  better  opportunities  on  the  mag- 
nates' estates.  The  decree  also  established  the  entail  system  (see 
Glossary).  Hungary's  economy  continued  to  flourish  during  Louis's 


11

reign.  Gold  and  other  precious  metals  poured  from  the  country's 
mines  and  enriched  the  royal  treasury,  foreign  trade  increased,  new 
towns  and  villages  arose,  and  craftsmen  formed  guilds.  The 
prosperity  fueled  a  surge  in  cultural  activity,  and  Louis  promoted 
the  illumination  of  manuscripts  and  in  1367  founded  Hungary's 
first  university.  Abroad,  however,  Louis  fought  several  costly  wars 
and  wasted  time,  funds,  and  lives  in  failed  attempts  to  gain  for 
his  nephew  the  throne  of  Naples.  While  Louis  was  engaged  in  these 
activities,  the  Turks  made  their  initial  inroads  into  the  Balkans. 
Louis  became  king  of  Poland  in  1370  and  ruled  the  two  countries 
for  twelve  years. 

Sigismund  (1387-1437),  Louis's  son-in-law,  won  a  bitter  strug- 
gle for  the  throne  after  Louis  died  in  1382.  Under  Sigismund,  Hun- 
gary's fortunes  began  to  decline.  Many  Hungarian  nobles  despised 
Sigismund  for  his  cruelty  during  the  succession  struggle,  his  long 
absences,  and  his  costly  foreign  wars.  In  1401  disgruntled  nobles 
temporarily  imprisoned  the  king.  In  1403  another  group  crowned 
an  anti-king,  who  failed  to  solidify  his  power  but  succeeded  in  sell- 
ing Dalmatia  to  Venice.  Sigismund  failed  to  reclaim  the  territory. 
Sigismund  became  the  Holy  Roman  Emperor  in  1410  and  king 
of  Bohemia  in  1419,  thus  requiring  him  to  spend  long  periods 
abroad  and  enabling  Hungary's  magnates  to  acquire  unprecedented 
power.  In  response,  Sigismund  created  the  office  of  palatine  (see 
Glossary)  to  rule  the  country  in  his  stead.  Like  earlier  Hungarian 
kings,  Sigismund  elevated  his  supporters  to  magnate  status  and 
sold  off  crown  lands  to  meet  burgeoning  expenses.  Although  Hun- 
gary's economy  continued  to  flourish,  Sigismund' s  expenses  out- 
stripped his  income.  He  bolstered  royal  revenues  by  increasing  the 
serfs'  taxes  and  requiring  cash  payment.  Social  turmoil  erupted 
late  in  Sigismund' s  reign  as  a  result  of  the  heavier  taxes  and  renewed 
magnate  pressure  on  the  lesser  nobles.  Hungary's  first  peasant  revolt 
erupted  when  a  Transylvanian  bishop  ordered  peasants  to  pay  tithes 
in  coin  rather  than  in  kind.  The  revolt  was  quickly  checked,  but 
it  prompted  Transylvania's  Szekel,  Magyar,  and  German  nobles 
to  form  the  Union  of  Three  Nations,  which  was  an  effort  to  de- 
fend their  privileges  against  any  power  except  that  of  the  king. 

Additional  turmoil  erupted  when  the  Ottoman  Turks  expanded 
their  empire  into  the  Balkans.  They  crossed  the  Bosporus  Straits 
in  1352,  subdued  Bulgaria  in  1388,  and  defeated  the  Serbs  at 
Kosovo  Polje  in  1389.  Sigismund  led  a  crusade  against  them  in 
1396,  but  the  Ottomans  routed  his  forces  at  Nicopolis,  and  he  barely 
escaped  with  his  life.  Tamerlane's  invasion  of  Anatolia  in  1402-03 
slowed  the  Turks'  progress  for  several  decades,  but  in  1437  Sultan 
Murad  prepared  to  invade  Hungary.  Sigismund  died  the  same  year,

and  Hungary's  next  two  kings,  Albrecht  V  of  Austria  (1437-39) 
and  Wladyslaw  III  of  Poland  (1439-44),  who  was  known  in  Hun- 
gary as  Ulaszlo  I,  both  died  during  campaigns  against  the  Turks. 

After  Ulaszlo,  Hungary's  nobles  chose  an  infant  king,  Laszlo  V, 
and  a  regent,  Janos  Hunyadi,  to  rule  the  country  until  Laszlo  V 
came  of  age.  The  son  of  a  lesser  nobleman  of  the  Vlach  tribe, 
Hunyadi  rose  to  become  a  general,  Transylvania's  military  gover- 
nor, one  of  Hungary's  largest  landowners,  and  a  war  hero.  He 
used  his  personal  wealth  and  the  support  of  the  lesser  nobles  to 
win  the  regency  and  overcome  the  opposition  of  the  magnates. 
Hunyadi  then  established  a  mercenary  army  funded  by  the  first 
tax  ever  imposed  on  Hungary's  nobles.  He  defeated  the  Ottoman 
forces  in  Transylvania  in  1442  and  broke  their  hold  on  Serbia  in 
1443,  only  to  be  routed  at  Varna  (where  Laszlo  V  himself  perished) 
a  year  later.  In  1456,  when  the  Turkish  army  besieged  Belgrade, 
Hunyadi  defeated  it  in  his  greatest  and  final  victory.  Hunyadi  died 
of  the  plague  soon  after. 

Some  magnates  resented  Hunyadi  for  his  popularity  as  well  as 
for  the  taxes  he  imposed,  and  they  feared  that  his  sons  might  seize 
the  throne  from  Laszlo.  They  coaxed  the  sons  to  return  to  Laszlo 's 
court,  where  Hunyadi 's  elder  son  was  beheaded.  His  younger  son, 
Matyas,  was  imprisoned  in  Bohemia.  However,  lesser  nobles  loyal 
to  Matyas  soon  expelled  Laszlo.  After  Laszlo' s  death  abroad,  they 
paid  ransom  for  Matyas,  met  him  on  the  frozen  Danube  River,

and  proclaimed  him  king.  Known  as  Matyas  Corvinus  (1458-90), 
he  was,  with  one  possible  exception  (Janos  Zapolyai),  the  last  Hun- 
garian king  to  rule  the  country. 

Although  Matyas  regularly  convened  the  Diet  and  expanded  the 
lesser  nobles'  powers  in  the  counties,  he  exercised  absolute  rule 
over  Hungary  by  means  of  a  secular  bureaucracy.  Matyas  enlisted 
30,000  foreign  mercenaries  in  his  standing  army  and  built  a  net- 
work of  fortresses  along  Hungary's  southern  frontier,  but  he  did 
not  pursue  his  father's  aggressive  anti-Turkish  policy.  Instead, 
Matyas  launched  unpopular  attacks  on  Bohemia,  Poland,  and  Aus- 
tria, pursuing  an  ambition  to  become  Holy  Roman  Emperor  and 
arguing  that  he  was  trying  to  forge  a  unified  Western  alliance  strong 
enough  to  expel  the  Turks  from  Europe.  He  eliminated  tax  ex- 
emptions and  raised  the  serfs'  obligations  to  the  crown  to  fund  his 
court  and  the  military.  The  magnates  complained  that  these  mea- 
sures reduced  their  incomes,  but  despite  the  stiffer  obligations,  the 
serfs  considered  Matyas  a  just  ruler  because  he  protected  them  from 
excessive  demands  and  other  abuses  by  the  magnates.  He  also 
reformed  Hungary's  legal  system  and  promoted  the  growth  of  Hun- 
gary's towns.  Matyas  was  a  true  renaissance  man  and  made  his 
court  a  center  of  humanist  culture;  under  his  rule,  Hungary's  first 
books  were  printed  and  its  second  university  was  established. 
Matyas's  library,  the  Corvina,  was  famous  throughout  Europe. 
In  his  quest  for  the  imperial  throne,  Matyas  eventually  moved  to 
Vienna,  where  he  died  in  1490. 

Reign  of  Ul£szl<5  II  and  Louis  II 

Matyas's  reforms  did  not  survive  the  turbulent  decades  that  fol- 
lowed his  reign.  An  oligarchy  of  quarrelsome  magnates  gained  con- 
trol of  Hungary.  They  crowned  a  docile  king,  Vladislav  Jagiello 
(the  Jagiellonian  king  of  Bohemia,  who  was  known  in  Hungary 
as  Ulaszlo  II,  1490-1516),  only  on  condition  that  he  abolish  the 
taxes  that  had  supported  Matyas's  mercenary  army.  As  a  result, 
the  king's  army  dispersed  just  as  the  Turks  were  threatening  Hun- 
gary. The  magnates  also  dismantled  Matyas's  administration  and 
antagonized  the  lesser  nobles.  In  1492  the  Diet  limited  the  serfs' 
freedom  of  movement  and  expanded  their  obligations.  Rural  dis- 
content boiled  over  in  1514  when  well-armed  peasants  under 
Gyorgy  Dozsa  rose  up  and  attacked  estates  across  Hungary.  United 
by  a  common  threat,  the  magnates  and  lesser  nobles  eventually 
crushed  the  rebels.  Dozsa  and  other  rebel  leaders  were  executed 
in  a  most  brutal  manner. 

Shocked  by  the  peasant  revolt,  the  Diet  of  1514  passed  laws  that 
condemned  the  serfs  to  eternal  bondage  and  increased  their  work 


14

obligations.  Corporal  punishment  became  widespread,  and  one 
noble  even  branded  his  serfs  like  livestock.  The  legal  scholar  Stephen 
Werboczy  included  the  new  laws  in  his  Tripartitum  of  1514,  which 
made  up  Hungary's  legal  corpus  until  the  revolution  of  1848.  The 
Tripartitum  gave  Hungary's  king  and  nobles,  or  magnates,  equal 
shares  of  power:  the  nobles  recognized  the  king  as  superior,  but 
in  turn  the  nobles  had  the  power  to  elect  the  king.  The  Triparti- 
tum also  freed  the  nobles  from  taxation,  obligated  them  to  serve 
in  the  military  only  in  a  defensive  war,  and  made  them  immune 
from  arbitrary  arrest.  The  new  laws  weakened  Hungary  by  deepen- 
ing the  rift  between  the  nobles  and  the  peasantry  just  as  the  Turks 
prepared  to  invade  the  country. 

When  Ulaszlo  II  died  in  1516,  his  ten-year-old  son  Louis  II 
(1516-26)  became  king,  but  a  royal  council  appointed  by  the  Diet 
ruled  the  country.  Hungary  was  in  a  state  of  near  anarchy  under 
the  magnates'  rule.  The  king's  finances  were  a  shambles;  he  bor- 
rowed to  meet  his  household  expenses  despite  the  fact  that  they 
totaled  about  one-third  of  the  national  income.  The  country's 
defenses  sagged  as  border  guards  went  unpaid,  fortresses  fell  into 
disrepair,  and  initiatives  to  increase  taxes  to  reinforce  defenses  were 
stifled.  In  1521  Sultan  Suleyman  the  Magnificent  recognized  Hun- 
gary's weakness  and  seized  Belgrade  in  preparation  for  an  attack 
on  Hungary.  In  August  1526,  he  marched  more  than  100,000 
troops  into  Hungary's  heartland,  and  at  Mohacs  they  cut  down 
all  but  several  hundred  of  the  25,000  ill-equipped  soldiers  whom 
Louis  II  had  been  able  to  muster  for  the  country's  defense.  Louis 
himself  died,  thrown  from  a  horse  into  a  bog. 

After  Louis's  death,  rival  factions  of  Hungarian  nobles  simul- 
taneously elected  two  kings,  Janos  Zapolyai  (1526-40)  and  Ferdi- 
nand (1526-64).  Each  claimed  sovereignty  over  the  entire  country 
but  lacked  sufficient  forces  to  eliminate  his  rival.  Zapolyai,  a  Hun- 
garian and  the  military  governor  of  Transylvania,  was  recognized 
by  the  sultan  and  was  supported  mostly  by  lesser  nobles  opposed 
to  new  foreign  kings.  Ferdinand,  the  first  Habsburg  to  occupy 
the  Hungarian  throne,  drew  support  from  magnates  in  western 
Hungary  who  hoped  he  could  convince  his  brother,  Holy  Roman 
Emperor  Charles  V,  to  expel  the  Turks.  In  1538  George  Martinuzzi, 
Zapolyai' s  adviser,  arranged  a  treaty  between  the  rivals  that  would 
have  made  Ferdinand  sole  monarch  upon  the  death  of  the  then- 
childless  Zapolyai.  The  deal  collapsed  when  Zapolyai  married  and 
fathered  a  son.  Violence  erupted,  and  the  Turks  seized  the  oppor- 
tunity, conquering  the  city  of  Buda  and  then  partitioning  the  coun- 
try in  1541.

Partition  of  Hungary 

The  partition  of  Hungary  between  the  Ottoman  and  Habsburg 
empires  lasted  more  than  150  years.  Habsburg  Austria  controlled 
Royal  Hungary,  which  consisted  of  counties  along  the  Austrian 
border  and  some  of  northwestern  Croatia  (see  fig.  3).  The  Otto- 
mans annexed  central  and  southern  Hungary.  Transylvania  be- 
came an  Ottoman  vassal  state,  where  native  princes,  who  paid  the 
Turks  tribute,  ruled  with  considerable  autonomy.  After  the  Hun- 
garian defeat  at  Mohacs,  the  Protestant  Reformation  took  hold  in 
Hungary.  Initially,  German  burghers  in  Transylvania  and  Royal 
Hungary  adopted  Lutheranism;  later,  John  Calvin's  works  con- 
verted many  Magyars  in  Transylvania  and  central  Hungary.  The 
Reformation  spread  quickly,  and  by  the  early  seventeenth  century 
hardly  any  noble  families  remained  Catholic.  Archbishop  Peter 
Pazmany  reorganized  Royal  Hungary's  Roman  Catholic  Church 
and  led  a  Counter- Reformation  that  reversed  the  Protestants'  gains 
in  Royal  Hungary,  using  persuasion  rather  than  intimidation. 
Transylvania,  however,  remained  a  Protestant  stronghold.  The 
Reformation  caused  rifts  between  Catholic  Magyars,  who  often 
sided  with  the  Habsburgs,  and  Protestant  Magyars,  who  developed 
a  strong  national  identity  and  became  rebels  in  Austrian  eyes. 
Chasms  also  developed  between  Royal  Hungary  and  Transylvania 
and  between  the  mostiy  Catholic  magnates  and  the  mainly  Pro- 
testant lesser  nobles. 

Royal  Hungary 

Royal  Hungary  became  a  small  part  of  the  Habsburg  Empire 
and  enjoyed  little  influence  in  Vienna.  The  Habsburg  king  directly 
controlled  Royal  Hungary's  financial,  military,  and  foreign  affairs, 
and  imperial  troops  guarded  its  borders.  The  Habsburgs  avoided 
filling  the  office  of  palatine  to  prevent  the  holder's  amassing  too 
much  power.  In  addition,  the  so-called  Turkish  question  divided 
the  Habsburgs  and  the  Hungarians:  Vienna  wanted  to  maintain 
peace  with  the  Turks;  the  Hungarians  wanted  the  Ottomans  ousted. 
As  the  Hungarians  recognized  the  weakness  of  their  position,  many 
became  anti-Habsburg.  They  complained  about  foreign  rule,  the 
behavior  of  foreign  garrisons,  and  the  Habsburgs'  recognition  of 
Turkish  sovereignty  in  Transylvania.  Protestants,  who  were  per- 
secuted in  Royal  Hungary,  considered  the  Counter-Reformation 
a  greater  menace  than  the  Turks,  however. 

Ottoman  Hungary 

Central  Hungary  became  a  province  of  the  Ottoman  Empire 
ruled  by  pashas  living  in  Buda.  The  Turks'  only  interest  was  to 


16 


Historical  Setting 


secure  their  hold  on  the  territory.  The  Sublime  Porte  (a  term  used 
to  designate  the  Ottoman  rulers)  became  the  sole  landowner  and 
managed  about  20  percent  of  the  land  for  its  own  benefit,  appor- 
tioning the  rest  among  soldiers  and  civil  servants.  The  new  land- 
lords were  interested  mainly  in  squeezing  as  much  wealth  from 
the  land  as  quickly  as  possible.  Wars,  slave-taking,  and  the  emi- 
gration of  nobles  who  lost  their  land  depopulated  much  of  the 
countryside.  However,  the  Turks  practiced  religious  tolerance  and 
allowed  the  Hungarians  living  within  the  empire  significant 
autonomy  in  internal  affairs.  Towns  maintained  some  self- 
government,  and  a  prosperous  middle  class  developed  through 
artisanry  and  trade. 

Transylvania 

Transylvania,  an  Ottoman  vassal  state,  functioned  for  many 
years  as  an  independent  country.  In  1542  Martinuzzi  revived  the 
1437  Union  of  Three  Nations  to  govern  the  land,  and  the  Tran- 
sylvanian  nobles  regularly  met  in  their  own  Diet.  In  1572  the  Diet 
created  freedom  of  worship  and  equal  political  rights  for  members 
of  Transylvania's  four  "established"  religions:  Roman  Catholic, 
Lutheran,  Unitarian,  and  Calvinist.  The  Eastern  Orthodox  Roma- 
nian serfs  were  permitted  to  worship,  but  the  Orthodox  Church 
was  not  recognized  as  an  "established"  religion,  and  the  Roma- 
nians did  not  share  political  equality. 

In  1591  the  Habsburgs  invaded  Transylvania  under  George 
Basta,  who  persecuted  Protestants  and  expropriated  estates  illegally 
until  Istvan  Bocskay,  a  former  Habsburg  supporter,  mustered  an 
army  that  expelled  Basta' s  forces  in  1604-05.  In  1606  Bocskay  con- 
cluded the  Peace  of  Vienna  with  the  Habsburgs  and  the  Peace  of 
Zsitvatorok  with  the  Turks.  The  treaties  secured  his  position  as 
prince  of  Transylvania,  guaranteed  rights  for  Royal  Hungary's  Pro- 
testants, broadened  Transylvania's  independence,  and  freed  the 
emperor  of  his  obligation  to  pay  tribute  to  the  Ottomans.  After 
Bocskay' s  death,  the  Ottomans  compelled  the  Transylvanians  to 
accept  Gabor  Bethlen  as  prince.  Transylvania  prospered  under 
Bethlen's  enlightened  despotism.  He  stimulated  agriculture,  trade, 
and  industry;  sank  new  mines;  sent  students  to  Protestant  univer- 
sities abroad;  and  prohibited  landlords  from  barring  children  of 
serfs  from  an  education.  Unfortunately,  when  Bethlen  died  in  1629, 
the  Transylvanian  Diet  abolished  most  of  his  reforms.  After  a  short 
succession  struggle,  Gyorgy  Rakoczi  I  (1648-60)  became  prince. 
Under  Rakoczi,  Transylvania  fought  with  the  Protestants  in  the 
Thirty  Years'  War  (1618-48)  and  was  mentioned  as  a  sovereign 
state  in  the  Peace  of  Westphalia.  Transylvania's  golden  age  ended 


17

after  Gyorgy  Rakoczi  II  (1648-60)  launched  an  attack  on  Poland 
without  the  prior  approval  of  the  Ottomans  or  Transylvania's  Diet. 
The  campaign  was  a  disaster,  and  the  Turks  used  the  opportunity 
to  rout  Rakoczi 's  army  and  take  control  of  Transylvania. 

End  of  the  Partition 

The  Ottoman  Empire  gradually  weakened  after  Suleyman's 
death  in  1559.  The  Ottoman  occupation  of  Hungary  continued, 
however,  not  so  much  because  of  the  Turks'  strength  but  because 
of  the  West's  disunity  and  lack  of  resolve.  Hungarian  nobles  grew 
impatient  with  the  Habsburgs'  persecution  of  Protestants  and  reluc- 
tance to  take  steps  to  drive  out  the  Turks.  Their  discontent  ex- 
ploded after  the  Habsburg  imperial  army  routed  a  Turkish  force 
at  St.  Gotthard  in  1664.  Instead  of  pressing  for  concessions,  Em- 
peror Leopold  I  (1657-1705)  concluded  the  Treaty  of  Vasvar  in 
which  he  conceded  to  the  Turks  more  Hungarian  territory  than 
they  had  ever  possessed.  After  Vasvar,  even  many  Catholic  mag- 
nates turned  against  the  Habsburgs. 

After  a  failed  Hungarian  plot  to  throw  off  Habsburg  rule, 
Leopold  suppressed  the  Hungarian  constitution,  subjected  Royal 
Hungary  to  direct  absolute  rule  from  Vienna,  and  harshly  repressed 
Hungarian  Protestants,  handing  over  Protestant  ministers  who 
refused  to  deny  their  faith  to  work  as  galley  slaves.  Hungarian  dis- 
content deepened.  In  1681  Imre  Thokoly,  a  Transylvanian  noble- 
man, led  a  rebellion  against  the  Habsburgs  and  forced  Leopold 
I  to  convoke  the  Diet  and  restore  Hungary's  constitution  and  the 
office  of  palatine.  Sensing  weakness,  the  Turks  made  their  strike 
against  Austria,  but  Polish  forces  routed  them  near  Vienna  in  1683. 
A  Western  campaign  then  gradually  drove  the  Turks  from  Hun- 
gary, and  the  sultan  surrendered  almost  all  of  his  Hungarian  and 
Croatian  possessions  in  the  Peace  of  Karlowitz  in  1699. 

Hungary  under  the  Habsburgs 

The  Habsburgs  ruled  autocratically  on  almost  all  questions  ex- 
cept taxation  and  relegated  Hungary  to  the  status  of  a  colony,  a 
factor  that,  together  with  other  factors,  stifled  economic  develop- 
ment. After  more  than  a  century  of  stagnation,  the  lesser  nobles, 
under  increasing  economic  pressure  and  prompted  by  nascent  Hun- 
garian nationalism,  pressed  for  reform.  The  crescendo  of  discon- 
tent climaxed  in  the  March  1848  revolution.  Russian  troops  quashed 
the  rebellion,  enabling  Austrian  emperor  Franz  Joseph  to  impose 
absolute  control  for  almost  two  decades. 

Reign  of  Leopold  II 

As  the  Habsburgs  gained  control  of  the  country,  the  ministers 


19 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


of  Leopold  I  argued  that  he  should  rule  Hungary  as  conquered 
territory.  One  even  said  Vienna  should  first  make  the  Hungarians 
beggars,  then  Catholics,  and  then  Germans.  At  the  Diet  of  Press- 
burg  in  1687,  the  emperor  promised  to  observe  all  of  Hungary's 
laws  and  privileges.  Hereditary  succession  of  the  Habsburgs  was 
recognized,  however,  and  the  nobles'  right  of  resistance  was 
abrogated.  In  1690  Leopold  began  redistributing  lands  freed  from 
the  Turks.  Protestant  nobles  and  all  other  Hungarians  thought  dis- 
loyal by  the  Habsburgs  lost  their  estates,  which  were  given  to 
foreigners.  Vienna  controlled  Hungary's  foreign  affairs,  defense, 
tariffs,  and  other  functions,  and  it  separated  Transylvania  from 
Hungary,  treating  it  as  a  separate  imperial  territory. 

The  repression  of  Protestants  and  the  land  seizures  embittered 
the  Hungarians,  and  in  1703  a  peasant  uprising  sparked  an  eight- 
year  national  rebellion  aimed  at  casting  off  the  Habsburg  yoke. 
Disgruntled  Protestants,  peasants,  and  soldiers  united  under  Ferenc 
Rakoczi,  a  Roman  Catholic  magnate  who  could  hardly  speak  Hun- 
garian. Most  of  Hungary  soon  supported  Rakoczi,  and  the  joint 
Hungarian-Transylvanian  Diet  voted  to  annul  the  Habsburgs'  right 
to  the  throne.  Fortunes  turned  against  the  rebels,  however,  when 
the  Habsburgs  made  peace  in  the  West  and  turned  their  full  force 
against  Hungary.  The  rebellion  ended  in  1711,  when  moderate 
rebel  leaders  concluded  the  Treaty  of  Szatmar,  in  which  the  Hun- 
garians gained  little  except  the  emperor's  agreement  to  reconvene 
the  Diet  and  to  grant  an  amnesty  for  the  rebels. 

Reign  of  Charles  VI  and  Maria  Theresa 

Leopold's  successor,  Charles  VI  (1711-40),  began  building  a 
workable  relationship  with  Hungary  after  the  Treaty  of  Szatmar. 
Charles  needed  the  Hungarian  Diet's  approval  for  the  Pragmatic 
Sanction,  under  which  the  Habsburg  monarch  was  to  rule  Hun- 
gary not  as  emperor  but  as  a  king  subject  to  the  restraints  of  Hun- 
gary's constitution  and  laws.  He  hoped  that  the  Pragmatic  Sanction 
would  keep  the  Habsburg  Empire  intact  if  his  daughter,  Maria 
Theresa,  succeeded  him.  The  Diet  approved  the  Pragmatic  Sanc- 
tion in  1723,  and  Hungary  thus  agreed  to  became  a  hereditary 
monarchy  under  the  Habsburgs  for  as  long  as  their  dynasty  existed. 
In  practice,  however,  Charles  and  his  successors  governed  almost 
autocratically,  controlling  Hungary's  foreign  affairs,  defense,  and 
finance  but  lacking  the  power  to  tax  the  nobles  without  their  ap- 
proval. The  Habsburgs  also  maintained  Transylvania's  separation 
from  Hungary. 

Charles  organized  Hungary's  first  modern,  centralized  admin- 
istration and  in  1715  established  a  standing  army  under  his 


20 


Historical  Setting 


command,  which  was  entirely  funded  and  manned  by  the  nonnoble 
population.  This  policy  reduced  the  nobles'  military  obligation 
without  abrogating  their  exemption  from  taxation.  Charles  also 
banned  conversion  to  Protestantism,  required  civil  servants  to 
profess  Catholicism,  and  forbade  Protestant  students  to  study 
abroad. 

Maria  Theresa  (1740-80)  faced  an  immediate  challenge  from 
Prussia's  Frederick  II  when  she  became  head  of  the  House  of  Habs- 
burg.  In  1741  she  appeared  before  the  Hungarian  Diet  holding 
her  newborn  son  and  entreated  Hungary's  nobles  to  support  her. 
They  stood  behind  her  and  helped  secure  her  rule.  Maria  Theresa 
later  took  measures  to  reinforce  links  with  Hungary's  magnates. 
She  established  special  schools  to  attract  Hungarian  nobles  to 
Vienna.  During  her  reign,  the  members  of  the  magnate  class  lost 
their  Hungarian  national  identity,  including  their  knowledge  of 
the  Hungarian  language. 

Under  Charles  and  Maria  Theresa,  Hungary  experienced  fur- 
ther economic  decline.  Centuries  of  Ottoman  occupation,  rebel- 
lion, and  war  had  reduced  Hungary's  population  drastically,  and 
large  parts  of  the  country's  southern  half  were  almost  deserted. 
A  labor  shortage  developed  as  landowners  restored  their  estates. 
In  response,  the  Habsburgs  began  to  colonize  Hungary  with  large 
numbers  of  peasants  from  all  over  Europe,  especially  Slovaks,  Serbs, 
Croatians,  and  Germans.  Many  Jews  also  immigrated  from  Vienna 
and  the  empire's  Polish  lands  near  the  end  of  the  century.  Hun- 
gary's population  more  than  tripled  to  8  million  between  1720  and 
1787.  However,  only  39  percent  of  its  people  were  Magyars,  who 
lived  mainly  in  the  center  of  the  country. 

A  complex  patchwork  of  minority  peoples  emerged  in  the  lands 
along  Hungary's  periphery.  Droves  of  Romanians  entered  Tran- 
sylvania during  the  same  period.  The  Protestant  and  Catholic  Hun- 
garians and  Germans  who  had  been  there  for  years  had  considered 
the  Orthodox  Romanians  inferior  and  relegated  them  to  serfdom. 
In  the  eighteenth  century,  leaders  of  the  Orthodox  Church  began 
arguing  that  Romanians  were  descendants  of  the  Roman  Dacians 
and  thus  Transylvania's  original  inhabitants.  The  Orthodox  leaders 
demanded,  without  success,  that  the  Romanians  be  recognized  as 
Transylvania's  fourth  "nation"  and  the  Orthodox  Church  as  its 
fifth  "established"  religion. 

In  the  early  to  mid-eighteenth  century,  Hungary  had  a  primi- 
tive agricultural  economy  that  employed  90  percent  of  the  popula- 
tion. The  nobles  failed  to  use  fertilizers,  roads  were  poor  and  rivers 
blocked,  and  crude  storage  methods  caused  huge  losses  of  grain. 
Barter  had  replaced  money  transactions,  and  little  trade  existed 


21 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


between  towns  and  the  serfs.  After  1760  a  labor  surplus  developed. 
The  serf  population  grew,  pressure  on  the  land  increased,  and  the 
serfs'  standard  of  living  declined.  Landowners  began  making  greater 
demands  on  new  tenants  and  began  violating  existing  agreements. 
In  response,  Maria  Theresa  issued  her  Urbarium  of  1767  to  pro- 
tect the  serfs  by  restoring  their  freedom  of  movement  and  limiting 
the  corvee  (see  Glossary).  Despite  her  efforts  and  several  periods 
of  strong  demand  for  grain,  the  situation  worsened.  Between  1767 
and  1848,  many  serfs  left  their  holdings.  Most  became  landless  farm 
workers  because  a  lack  of  industrial  development  meant  few  op- 
portunities for  work  in  the  towns. 

Enlightened  Absolutism 

Joseph  II  (1780-90),  a  dynamic  leader  strongly  influenced  by 
the  Enlightenment,  shook  Hungary  from  its  malaise  when  he  in- 
herited the  throne  from  his  mother,  Maria  Theresa.  Joseph  sought 
to  centralize  control  of  the  empire  and  to  rule  it  by  decree  as  an 
enlightened  despot.  He  refused  to  take  the  Hungarian  coronation 
oath  to  avoid  being  constrained  by  Hungary's  constitution.  In  1781 
Joseph  issued  the  Patent  of  Toleration,  which  granted  Protestants 
and  Orthodox  Christians  full  civil  rights  and  Jews  freedom  of  wor- 
ship. He  decreed  that  German  replace  Latin  as  the  empire's  offi- 
cial language  and  granted  the  peasants  the  freedom  to  leave  their 
holdings,  to  marry,  and  to  place  their  children  in  trades.  Hungary, 
Croatia,  and  Transylvania  became  a  single  imperial  territory  under 
one  administration.  When  the  Hungarian  nobles  again  refused  to 
waive  their  exemption  from  taxation,  Joseph  banned  imports  of 
Hungarian  manufactured  goods  into  Austria  and  began  a  survey 
to  prepare  for  imposition  of  a  general  land  tax. 

Joseph's  reforms  outraged  Hungary's  nobles  and  clergy,  and  the 
country's  peasants  grew  dissatisfied  with  taxes,  conscription,  and 
requisitions  of  supplies.  Hungarians  perceived  Joseph's  language 
reform  as  German  cultural  hegemony,  and  they  reacted  by  insist- 
ing on  the  right  to  use  their  own  tongue.  As  a  result,  Hungarian 
lesser  nobles  sparked  a  renaissance  of  the  Magyar  language  and 
culture,  and  a  cult  of  national  dance  and  costume  flourished.  The 
lesser  nobles  questioned  the  loyalty  of  the  magnates,  of  whom  less 
than  half  were  ethnic  Magyars,  and  even  those  had  become  French- 
and  German- speaking  courtiers.  The  Magyar  national  reawaken- 
ing subsequently  triggered  national  revivals  among  the  Slovak, 
Romanian,  Serbian,  and  Croatian  minorities  within  Hungary  and 
Transylvania  who  felt  threatened  by  both  German  and  Magyar 
cultural  hegemony.  These  national  revivals  later  blossomed  into

the  nationalist  movements  of  the  nineteenth  and  twentieth  centuries 
that  contributed  to  the  empire's  ultimate  collapse. 

Late  in  his  reign,  Joseph  led  a  costly,  ill-fated  campaign  against 
the  Turks  that  weakened  his  empire.  On  January  28,  1790,  three 
weeks  before  his  death,  the  emperor  issued  a  decree  canceling  all 
of  his  reforms  except  the  Patent  of  Toleration,  peasant  reforms, 
and  abolition  of  the  religious  orders. 

Joseph's  successor,  Leopold  II  (1790-92),  recognized  Hungary 
again  as  a  separate  country  under  a  Habsburg  king  and  reestab- 
lished Croatia  and  Transylvania  as  separate  territorial  entities.  In 
1791  the  Diet  passed  Law  X,  which  stressed  Hungary's  status  as 
an  independent  kingdom  ruled  only  by  a  king  legally  crowned 
according  to  Hungarian  laws.  Law  X  became  the  basis  for  demands 
by  Hungarian  reformers  for  statehood  in  the  period  from  1825  to 
1849.  New  laws  again  required  approval  of  both  the  Habsburg  king 
and  the  Diet,  and  Latin  was  restored  as  the  official  language.  The 
peasant  reforms  remained  in  effect,  however,  and  Protestants 
remained  equal  before  the  law.  Leopold  died  in  March  1792  just 
as  the  French  Revolution  was  about  to  degenerate  into  the  Reign 
of  Terror  and  send  shock  waves  through  the  royal  houses  of  Europe. 

Enlightened  absolutism  ended  in  Hungary  under  Leopold's  suc- 
cessor, Francis  I  (1792-1835),  who  developed  an  almost  abnormal 
aversion  to  change,  bringing  Hungary  decades  of  political  stagna- 
tion. In  1795  the  Hungarian  police  arrested  an  abbot  and  several 
of  the  country's  leading  thinkers  for  plotting  a  Jacobin  kind  of  revo- 
lution to  install  a  radical  democratic,  egalitarian  political  system 
in  Hungary.  Thereafter,  Francis  resolved  to  extinguish  any  spark 
of  reform  that  might  ignite  revolution.  The  execution  of  the  al- 
leged plotters  silenced  any  reform  advocates  among  the  nobles,  and 
for  about  three  decades  reform  ideas  remained  confined  to  poetry 
and  philosophy.  The  magnates,  who  also  feared  that  the  influx  of 
revolutionary  ideas  might  precipitate  a  popular  uprising,  became 
a  tool  of  the  crown  and  seized  the  chance  to  further  burden  the 
peasants. 

Economic  and  Social  Developments 

By  the  turn  of  the  nineteenth  century,  the  aim  of  Hungary's 
agricultural  producers  had  shifted  from  subsistence  farming  and 
small-scale  production  for  local  trade  to  cash-generating,  large-scale 
production  for  a  wider  market.  Road  and  waterway  improvements 
cut  transportation  costs,  while  urbanization  in  Austria,  Bohemia, 
and  Moravia  and  the  need  for  supplies  for  the  Napoleonic  wars 
boosted  demand  for  foodstuffs  and  clothing.  Hungary  became  a 
major  grain  and  wool  exporter.  New  lands  were  cleared,  and  yields 


23 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

rose  as  farming  methods  improved.  Hungary  did  not  reap  the  full 
benefit  of  the  boom,  however,  because  most  of  the  profits  went  to 
the  magnates,  who  considered  them  not  as  capital  for  investment 
but  as  a  means  of  adding  luxury  to  their  lives.  As  expectations  rose, 
goods  such  as  linen  and  silverware,  once  considered  luxuries,  be- 
came necessities.  The  wealthy  magnates  had  little  trouble  balanc- 
ing their  earnings  and  expenditures,  but  many  lesser  nobles,  fearful 
of  losing  their  social  standing,  went  into  debt  to  finance  their 
spending. 

Napoleon's  final  defeat  brought  recession.  Grain  prices  collapsed 
as  demand  dropped,  and  debt  ensnared  much  of  Hungary's  lesser 
nobility.  Poverty  forced  many  lesser  nobles  to  work  to  earn  a  liveli- 
hood, and  their  sons  entered  education  institutions  to  train  for  civil 
service  or  professional  careers.  The  decline  of  the  lesser  nobility 
continued  despite  the  fact  that  by  1820  Hungary's  exports  had  sur- 
passed wartime  levels.  As  more  lesser  nobles  earned  diplomas,  the 
bureaucracy  and  professions  became  saturated,  leaving  a  host  of 
disgruntied  graduates  without  jobs.  Members  of  this  new  intelligen- 
tsia quickly  became  enamored  of  radical  political  ideologies  emanat- 
ing from  Western  Europe  and  organized  themselves  to  effect 
changes  in  Hungary's  political  system. 

Francis  rarely  called  the  Diet  into  session  (usually  only  to  re- 
quest men  and  supplies  for  war)  without  hearing  complaints.  Eco- 
nomic hardship  brought  the  lesser  nobles'  discontent  to  a  head  by 
1825,  when  Francis  finally  convoked  the  Diet  after  a  fourteen-year 
hiatus.  Grievances  were  voiced,  and  open  calls  for  reform  were 
made,  including  demands  for  less  royal  interference  in  the  nobles' 
affairs  and  for  wider  use  of  the  Hungarian  language. 

The  first  great  figure  of  the  reform  era  came  to  the  fore  during 
the  1825  convocation  of  the  Diet.  Count  Istvan  Szechenyi,  a  mag- 
nate from  one  of  Hungary's  most  powerful  families,  shocked  the 
Diet  when  he  delivered  the  first  speech  in  Hungarian  ever  uttered 
in  the  upper  chamber  and  backed  a  proposal  for  the  creation  of 
a  Hungarian  academy  of  arts  and  sciences  by  pledging  a  year's 
income  to  support  it.  In  1831  angry  nobles  burned  Szechenyi 's  book 
Hitel  (Credit),  in  which  he  argued  that  the  nobles'  privileges  were 
both  morally  indefensible  and  economically  detrimental  to  the 
nobles  themselves.  Szechenyi  called  for  an  economic  revolution  and 
argued  that  only  the  magnates  were  capable  of  implementing  re- 
forms. Szechenyi  favored  a  strong  link  with  the  Habsburg  Empire 
and  called  for  abolition  of  entail  and  serfdom,  taxation  of  land- 
owners, financing  of  development  with  foreign  capital,  establish- 
ment of  a  national  bank,  and  introduction  of  wage  labor.  He 
inspired  such  projects  as  the  construction  of  the  suspension  bridge

linking  Buda  and  Pest.  Szechenyi's  reform  initiatives  ultimately 
failed  because  they  were  targeted  at  the  magnates,  who  were  not 
inclined  to  support  change,  and  because  the  pace  of  his  program 
was  too  slow  to  attract  disgruntled  lesser  nobles. 

The  most  popular  of  Hungary's  great  reform  leaders,  Lajos 
Kossuth,  addressed  passionate  calls  for  change  to  the  lesser  nobles. 
Kossuth  was  the  son  of  a  landless,  lesser  nobleman  of  Protestant 
background.  He  practiced  law  with  his  father  before  moving  to  Pest. 
There  he  published  commentaries  on  the  Diet's  activities,  which 
made  him  popular  with  young,  reform-minded  people.  Kossuth 
was  imprisoned  in  1836  for  treason.  After  his  release  in  1840,  he 
gained  quick  notoriety  as  the  editor  of  a  liberal  party  newspaper. 
Kossuth  argued  that  only  political  and  economic  separation  from 
Austria  would  improve  Hungary's  plight.  He  called  for  broader 
parliamentary  democracy,  industrialization,  general  taxation,  eco- 
nomic expansion  through  exports,  and  abolition  of  privileges  and 
serfdom.  But  Kossuth  was  also  a  Magyar  chauvinist  whose  rhetoric 
provoked  the  strong  resentment  of  Hungary's  minority  ethnic 
groups.  Kossuth  gained  support  among  liberal  lesser  nobles,  who 
constituted  an  opposition  minority  in  the  Diet.  They  sought  re- 
forms with  increasing  success  after  Francis's  death  in  1835  and  the 


25

succession  of  Ferdinand  V  (1835-48).  In  1843  a  law  was  enacted 
making  Hungarian  the  country's  official  language  over  the  strong 
objections  of  the  Croats,  Slovaks,  Serbs,  and  Romanians. 

The  Revolution  of  March  1848 

In  March  1848,  revolution  erupted  in  Vienna,  forcing  Austria's 
Chancellor  Klemens  von  Metternich  to  flee  the  capital.  Unrest  broke 
out  in  Hungary  on  March  15,  when  radicals  and  students  stormed 
the  Buda  fortress  to  release  political  prisoners.  A  day  later,  the  Diet's 
liberal-dominated  lower  house  demanded  establishment  of  a  na- 
tional government  responsible  to  an  elected  parliament,  and  on 
March  22  a  new  national  cabinet  took  power  with  Count  Louis 
Batthyany  as  chairman,  Kossuth  as  minister  of  finance,  and 
Szechenyi  as  minister  of  public  works.  Under  duress,  the  Diet's 
upper  house  approved  a  sweeping  reform  package,  signed  by 
Ferdinand,  that  altered  almost  every  aspect  of  Hungary's  economic, 
social,  and  political  life.  These  so-called  April  Laws  created  indepen- 
dent Hungarian  ministries  of  defense  and  finance,  and  the  new 
government  claimed  the  right  to  issue  currency  through  its  own 
central  bank.  Guilds  lost  their  privileges;  the  nobles  became  sub- 
ject to  taxation;  entail,  tithes,  and  the  corvee  were  abolished;  some 
peasants  became  freehold  proprietors  of  the  land  they  worked;  free- 
dom of  the  press  and  assembly  were  created;  a  Hungarian  national 
guard  was  established;  and  Transylvania  was  brought  under  Hun- 
garian rule. 

The  non-Magyar  ethnic  groups  in  Hungary  feared  the  nation- 
alism of  the  new  Hungarian  government,  and  Transylvanian  Ger- 
mans and  Romanians  opposed  the  incorporation  of  Transylvania 
into  Hungary.  The  Vienna  government  enlisted  the  minorities  in 
the  first  attempt  to  overthrow  the  Hungarian  government.  Josip 
Jelacic — a  fanatic  anti-Hungarian — became  governor  of  Croatia 
on  March  22  and  severed  relations  with  the  Hungarian  govern- 
ment a  month  later.  By  summer  the  revolution's  momentum  be- 
gan to  wane.  The  Austrians  ordered  the  Hungarian  Diet  to  dissolve, 
but  the  order  went  unheeded.  In  September  Jelacic  led  an  army 
into  Hungary.  Batthyany  resigned,  and  a  mob  lynched  the  imperial 
commander  in  Pest.  A  committee  of  national  defense  under  Kossuth 
took  control,  authorized  the  establishment  of  a  Hungarian  army, 
and  issued  paper  money  to  fund  it.  On  October  30,  1848,  imperial 
troops  entered  Vienna  and  suppressed  a  workers'  uprising,  effec- 
tively ending  the  revolution  everywhere  in  the  empire  except 
Hungary,  where  Kossuth's  army  had  overcome  Jelacic 's  forces. 
In  December  Ferdinand  abdicated  in  favor  of  Franz  Joseph 
(1848-1916),  who  claimed  more  freedom  of  action  because,  unlike 


26

Ferdinand,  he  had  given  no  pledge  to  respect  the  April  Laws.  The 
Magyars,  however,  refused  to  recognize  him  as  their  king  because 
he  was  never  crowned. 

The  imperial  army  captured  Pest  early  in  1849,  but  the  revolu- 
tionary government  remained  entrenched  in  Debrecen.  In  April 
a  "rump"  Diet  deposed  the  Habsburg  Dynasty  in  Hungary, 
proclaimed  Hungary  a  republic,  and  named  Kossuth  governor  with 
dictatorial  powers.  After  the  declaration,  Austrian  reinforcements 
were  transferred  to  Hungary,  and  in  June,  at  Franz  Joseph's  re- 
quest, Russian  troops  attacked  from  the  east  and  overwhelmed  the 
Hungarians.  The  Hungarian  army  surrendered  on  August  13,  and 
Kossuth  escaped  to  the  Ottoman  Empire.  A  period  of  harsh  repres- 
sion followed.  Batthyany  and  about  100  others  were  shot,  several 
society  women  were  publicly  whipped,  and  the  government  out- 
lawed public  gatherings,  theater  performances,  display  of  the  na- 
tional colors,  and  wearing  of  national  costumes  and  Kossuth-style 
beards. 

Aftermath  of  the  Revolution 

After  the  revolution,  the  emperor  revoked  Hungary's  constitution 
and  assumed  absolute  control.  Franz  Joseph  divided  the  coun- 
try into  four  distinct  territories:  Hungary,  Transylvania,  Croatia- 
Slavonia,  and  Vojvodina.  German  and  Bohemian  administrators 
managed  the  government,  and  German  became  the  language  of 
administration  and  higher  education.  The  non-Magyar  minorities 
of  Hungary  received  little  for  their  support  of  Austria  during  the 
turmoil.  A  Croat  reportedly  told  a  Hungarian:  "We  received  as 
a  reward  what  the  Magyars  got  as  a  punishment." 

Hungarian  public  opinion  split  over  the  country's  relations  with 
Austria.  Some  Hungarians  held  out  hope  for  full  separation  from 
Austria;  others  wanted  an  accommodation  with  the  Habsburgs, 
provided  that  they  respected  Hungary's  constitution  and  laws. 
Ferencz  Deak  became  the  main  advocate  for  accommodation.  Deak 
upheld  the  legality  of  the  April  Laws  and  argued  that  their  amend- 
ment required  the  Hungarian  Diet's  consent.  He  also  held  that 
the  dethronement  of  the  Habsburgs  was  invalid.  As  long  as  Aus- 
tria ruled  absolutely,  Deak  argued,  Hungarians  should  do  no  more 
than  passively  resist  illegal  demands. 

The  first  crack  in  Franz  Joseph's  neo-absolutist  rule  developed 
in  1859,  when  the  forces  of  Sardinia  and  France  defeated  Austria 
at  Solferno.  The  defeat  convinced  Franz  Joseph  that  national  and 
social  opposition  to  his  government  was  too  strong  to  be  managed 
by  decree  from  Vienna.  Gradually  he  recognized  the  necessity  of 
concessions  toward  Hungary,  and  Austria  and  Hungary  thus  moved 


27 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

toward  a  compromise.  In  1866  the  Prussians  defeated  the  Austrians, 
further  underscoring  the  weakness  of  the  Habsburg  Empire.  Negoti- 
ations between  the  emperor  and  the  Hungarian  leaders  were  in- 
tensified and  finally  resulted  in  the  Compromise  of  1867,  which 
created  the  Dual  Monarchy  of  Austria- Hungary,  also  known  as 
the  Austro- Hungarian  Empire. 

Dual  Monarchy 

The  Compromise  of  1867,  which  created  the  Dual  Monarchy, 
gave  the  Hungarian  government  more  control  of  its  domestic  af- 
fairs than  it  had  possessed  at  any  time  since  the  Battle  of  Mohacs 
(see  fig.  4).  However,  the  new  government  faced  severe  economic 
problems  and  the  growing  restiveness  of  ethnic  minorities.  World 
War  I  led  to  the  disintegration  of  Austria-Hungary,  and  in  the  after- 
math of  the  war,  a  series  of  governments — including  a  communist 
regime — assumed  power  in  Budapest  (in  1872  the  cities  of  Buda 
and  Pest  united  to  become  Budapest). 

Constitutional  and  Legal  Framework 

Once  again  a  Habsburg  emperor  became  king  of  Hungary,  but 
the  compromise  strictly  limited  his  power  over  the  country's  in- 
ternal affairs,  and  the  Hungarian  government  assumed  control  over 
its  domestic  affairs.  The  Hungarian  government  consisted  of  a 
prime  minister  and  cabinet  appointed  by  the  emperor  but  respon- 
sible to  a  bicameral  parliament  elected  by  a  narrow  franchise.  Joint 
Austro- Hungarian  affairs  were  managed  through  "common" 
ministries  of  foreign  affairs,  defense,  and  finance.  The  respective 
ministers  were  responsible  to  delegations  representing  separate 
Austrian  and  Hungarian  parliaments.  Although  the  "common" 
ministry  of  defense  administered  the  imperial  and  royal  armies, 
the  emperor  acted  as  their  commander  in  chief,  and  German  re- 
mained the  language  of  command  in  the  military  as  a  whole.  The 
compromise  determined  that  commercial  and  monetary  policy, 
tariffs,  the  railroad,  and  indirect  taxation  were  "common"  con- 
cerns to  be  negotiated  every  ten  years.  The  compromise  also 
returned  Transylvania,  Vojvodina,  and  the  military  frontier  to 
Hungary's  jurisdiction. 

At  Franz  Joseph's  insistence,  Hungary  and  Croatia  reached  a  simi- 
lar compromise  in  1868,  giving  the  Croats  a  special  status  in  Hun- 
gary. The  agreement  granted  the  Croats  autonomy  over  their  internal 
affairs.  The  Croatian  ban  would  now  be  nominated  by  the  Hun- 
garian prime  minister  and  appointed  by  the  king.  Areas  of 
"common"  concern  to  Hungarians  and  Croats  included  finance, 
currency  matters,  commercial  policy,  the  post  office,  and  the  railroad. 


28 


Historical  Setting 


Croatian  became  the  official  language  of  Croatia's  government, 
and  Croatian  representatives  discussing  "common"  affairs  before 
the  Hungarian  Diet  were  permitted  to  speak  Croatian. 

The  Nationalities  Law  enacted  in  1868  defined  Hungary  as  a 
single  nation  comprising  different  nationalities  whose  members  en- 
joyed equal  rights  in  all  areas  except  language.  Although  non- 
Hungarian  languages  could  be  used  in  local  government,  churches, 
and  schools,  Hungarian  became  the  official  language  of  the  cen- 
tral government  and  universities.  Many  Hungarians  thought  the 
act  too  generous,  while  minority- group  leaders  rejected  it  as  in- 
adequate. Slovaks  in  northern  Hungary,  Romanians  in  Transyl- 
vania, and  Serbs  in  Vojvodina  all  wanted  more  autonomy,  and 
unrest  followed  the  act's  passage.  The  government  took  no  fur- 
ther action  concerning  nationalities,  and  discontent  rose. 

Anti-Semitism  appeared  in  Hungary  early  in  the  century  as  a 
result  of  fear  of  economic  competition.  In  1840  a  partial  emanci- 
pation of  the  Jews  allowed  them  to  live  anywhere  except  certain 
depressed  mining  cities.  The  Jewish  Emancipation  Act  of  1868  gave 
Jews  equality  before  the  law  and  effectively  eliminated  all  bars  to 
their  participation  in  the  economy;  nevertheless,  informal  barriers 
kept  Jews  from  careers  in  politics  and  public  life. 

Rise  of  the  Liberal  Party 

Franz  Joseph  appointed  Gyula  Andrassy — a  member  of  Deak's 
party — prime  minister  in  1867.  His  government  strongly  favored 
the  Compromise  of  1867  and  followed  a  laissez-faire  economic  pol- 
icy. Guilds  were  abolished,  workers  were  permitted  to  bargain  for 
wages,  and  the  government  attempted  to  improve  education  and 
construct  roads  and  railroads.  Between  1850  and  1875,  Hungary's 
farms  prospered:  grain  prices  were  high,  and  exports  tripled.  But 
Hungary's  economy  accumulated  capital  too  slowly,  and  the 
government  relied  heavily  on  foreign  credits.  In  addition,  the  na- 
tional and  local  bureaucracies  began  to  grow  immediately  after  the 
compromise  became  effective.  Soon  the  cost  of  the  bureaucracy 
outpaced  the  country's  tax  revenues,  and  the  national  debt  soared. 
After  an  economic  downturn  in  the  mid- 1870s,  Deak's  party  suc- 
cumbed to  charges  of  financial  mismanagement  and  scandal. 

As  a  result  of  these  economic  problems,  Kalman  Tisza's  Lib- 
eral Party,  created  in  1875,  gained  power  that  same  year.  Tisza 
assembled  a  bureaucratic  political  machine  that  maintained  con- 
trol through  corruption  and  manipulation  of  a  woefully  unrepresen- 
tative electoral  system.  In  addition,  Tisza's  government  had  to 
withstand  both  dissatisfied  nationalities  and  Hungarians  who 
thought  Tisza  too  submissive  to  the  Austrians.  The  Liberals  argued 


29 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


Historical  Setting 


that  the  Dual  Monarchy  improved  Hungary's  economic  position 
and  enhanced  its  influence  in  European  politics. 

Tisza's  government  raised  taxes,  balanced  the  budget  within 
several  years  of  coming  to  power,  and  completed  large  road,  rail- 
road, and  waterway  projects.  Commerce  and  industry  expanded 
quickly.  After  1880  the  government  abandoned  its  laissez-faire  eco- 
nomic policies  and  encouraged  industry  with  loans,  subsidies, 
government  contracts,  tax  exemptions,  and  other  measures.  The 
number  of  Hungarians  who  earned  their  living  in  industry  dou- 
bled to  24.2  percent  of  the  population  between  1890  and  1910,  while 
the  number  dependent  on  agriculture  dropped  from  82  to  62  per- 
cent. However,  the  1880s  and  1890s  were  depression  years  for  the 
peasantry.  Rail  and  steamship  transport  gave  North  American 
farmers  access  to  European  markets,  and  Europe's  grain  prices  fell 
by  50  percent.  Large  landowners  fought  the  downturn  by  seeking 
trade  protection  and  other  political  remedies;  the  lesser  nobles, 
whose  farms  failed  in  great  numbers,  sought  positions  in  the  still- 
burgeoning  bureaucracy.  By  contrast,  the  peasantry  resorted  to 
subsistence  farming  and  worked  as  laborers  to  earn  money. 

Social  Changes 

Hungary's  population  rose  from  13  million  to  20  million  between 
1850  and  1910.  After  1867  Hungary's  feudal  society  gave  way  to 
a  more  complex  society  that  included  the  magnates,  lesser  nobles, 
middle  class,  working  class,  and  peasantry.  However,  the  mag- 
nates continued  to  wield  great  influence  through  several  conser- 
vative parties  because  of  their  massive  wealth  and  dominant  position 
in  the  upper  chamber  of  the  parliament.  They  fought  moderniza- 
tion and  sought  both  closer  ties  with  Vienna  and  a  restoration  of 
Hungary's  traditional  social  structure  and  institutions,  arguing  that 
agriculture  should  remain  the  mission  of  the  nobility.  They  won 
protection  from  the  market  by  reestablishment  of  a  system  of  en- 
tail and  also  pushed  for  restriction  of  middle-class  profiteering  and 
restoration  of  corporal  punishment.  The  Roman  Catholic  Church 
was  a  major  ally  of  the  magnates. 

Some  lesser-noble  landowners  survived  the  agrarian  depression 
of  the  late  nineteenth  century  and  continued  farming.  Many  others 
turned  to  the  bureaucracy  or  to  the  professions. 

In  the  mid- 1800s,  Hungary's  middle  class  consisted  of  a  small 
number  of  German  and  Jewish  merchants  and  workshop  owners 
who  employed  a  few  craftsmen.  By  the  turn  of  the  century,  however, 
the  middle  class  had  grown  in  size  and  complexity  and  had  be- 
come predominantiy  Jewish.  In  fact,  Jews  created  the  modern  econ- 
omy that  supported  Tisza's  bureaucratic  machine.  In  return,  Tisza

not  only  denounced  anti-Semitism  but  also  used  his  political 
machine  to  check  the  growth  of  an  anti-Semitic  party.  In  1896  his 
successors  passed  legislation  securing  the  Jews'  final  emancipation. 
By  1910  about  900,000  Jews  made  up  approximately  5  percent  of 
the  population  and  about  23  percent  of  Budapest's  citizenry.  Jews 
accounted  for  54  percent  of  commercial  business  owners,  85  per- 
cent of  financial  institution  directors  and  owners,  and  62  percent 
of  all  employees  in  commerce. 

The  rise  of  a  working  class  came  naturally  with  industrial  de- 
velopment. By  1900  Hungary's  mines  and  industries  employed 
nearly  1.2  million  people,  representing  13  percent  of  the  popula- 
tion. The  government  favored  low  wages  to  keep  Hungarian 
products  competitive  on  foreign  markets  and  to  prevent  im- 
poverished peasants  from  flocking  to  the  city  to  find  work.  The 
government  recognized  the  right  to  strike  in  1884,  but  labor  came 
under  strong  political  pressure.  In  1890  the  Social  Democratic  Party 
was  established  and  secretiy  formed  alliances  with  the  trade  unions. 
The  party  soon  enlisted  one-third  of  Budapest's  workers.  By  1900 
the  party  and  union  rolls  listed  more  than  200,000  hard-core  mem- 
bers, making  it  the  largest  secular  organization  the  country  had 
ever  known.  The  Diet  passed  laws  to  improve  the  lives  of  indus- 
trial workers,  including  providing  medical  and  accident  insurance, 
but  it  refused  to  extend  them  voting  rights,  arguing  that  broaden- 
ing the  franchise  would  give  too  many  non- Hungarians  the  vote 
and  threaten  Hungarian  domination.  After  the  Compromise  of 
1867,  the  Hungarian  government  also  launched  an  education  re- 
form in  an  effort  to  create  a  skilled,  literate  labor  force.  As  a  result, 
the  literacy  rate  had  climbed  to  80  percent  by  1910.  Literacy  raised 
the  expectations  of  workers  in  agriculture  and  industry  and  made 
them  ripe  for  participation  in  movements  for  political  and  social 
change. 

The  plight  of  the  peasantry  worsened  drastically  during  the 
depression  at  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century.  The  rural  popu- 
lation grew,  and  the  size  of  the  peasants'  farm  plots  shrank  as  land 
was  divided  up  by  successive  generations.  By  1900  almost  half  of 
the  country's  landowners  were  scratching  out  a  living  from  plots 
too  small  to  meet  basic  needs,  and  many  farm  workers  had  no  land 
at  all.  Many  peasants  chose  to  emigrate,  and  their  departure  rate 
reached  approximately  50,000  annually  in  the  1870s  and  about 
200,000  annually  by  1907.  The  peasantry's  share  of  the  popula- 
tion dropped  from  72.5  percent  in  1890  to  68.4  percent  in  1900. 
The  countryside  also  was  characterized  by  unrest,  to  which  the 
government  reacted  by  sending  in  troops,  banning  all  farm-labor 
organizations,  and  passing  other  repressive  legislation.

In  the  late  nineteenth  century,  the  Liberal  Party  passed  laws  that 
enhanced  the  government's  power  at  the  expense  of  the  Roman 
Catholic  Church.  The  parliament  won  the  right  to  veto  clerical  ap- 
pointments, and  it  reduced  the  church's  nearly  total  domination 
of  Hungary's  education  institutions.  Additional  laws  eliminated 
the  church's  authority  over  a  number  of  civil  matters  and,  in  the 
process,  introduced  civil  marriage  and  divorce  procedures. 

The  Liberal  Party  also  worked  with  some  success  to  create  a  uni- 
fied, Magyarized  state.  Ignoring  the  Nationalities  Law,  it  enacted 
laws  that  required  the  Hungarian  language  to  be  used  in  local  govern- 
ment and  increased  the  number  of  school  subjects  taught  in  that 
language.  After  1890  the  government  succeeded  in  Magyarizing  edu- 
cated Slovaks,  Germans,  Croats,  and  Romanians  and  co-opting  them 
into  the  bureaucracy,  thus  robbing  the  minority  nationalities  of  an 
educated  elite.  Most  minorities  never  learned  to  speak  Hungarian, 
but  the  education  system  made  them  aware  of  their  political  rights, 
and  their  discontent  with  Magyarization  mounted.  Bureaucratic  pres- 
sures and  heightened  fears  of  territorial  claims  against  Hungary  after 
the  creation  of  new  nation-states  in  the  Balkans  forced  Tisza  to  oudaw 
"national  agitation"  and  to  use  electoral  legerdemain  to  deprive  the 
minorities  of  representation.  Nevertheless,  in  1901  Romanian  and 
Slovak  national  parties  emerged  undaunted  by  incidents  of  electoral 
violence  and  police  repression.

Political  and  Economic  Life,  1905-19 

Tisza  directed  the  Liberal  government  until  1890,  and  for  four- 
teen years  thereafter  a  number  of  Liberal  prime  ministers  held 
office.  Agricultural  decline  continued,  and  the  bureaucracy  could 
no  longer  absorb  all  of  the  pauperized  lesser  nobles  and  educated 
people  who  could  not  find  work  elsewhere.  This  group  gave  its  po- 
litical support  to  the  Party  of  Independence  and  the  Party  of  Forty- 
Eight,  which  became  part  of  the  "national"  opposition  that  forced 
a  coalition  with  the  Liberals  in  1905.  The  Party  of  Independence 
resigned  itself  to  the  existence  of  the  Dual  Monarchy  and  sought 
to  enhance  Hungary's  position  within  it;  the  Party  of  Forty-Eight, 
however,  deplored  the  Compromise  of  1867,  argued  that  Hungary 
remained  an  Austrian  colony,  and  pushed  for  formation  of  a  Hun- 
garian national  bank  and  an  independent  customs  zone. 

Franz  Joseph  refused  to  appoint  members  of  the  coalition  to  the 
government  until  they  renounced  their  demands  for  concessions 
from  Austria  concerning  the  military.  When  the  coalition  finally 
gained  power  in  1906,  the  leaders  retreated  from  their  opposition 
to  the  Compromise  of  1867  and  followed  the  Liberal  Party's  eco- 
nomic policies.  Istvan  Tisza — Kalman  Tisza' s  son  and  prime 
minister  from  1903  to  1905 — formed  the  new  Party  of  Work,  which 
in  1910  won  a  large  majority  in  the  parliament.  Tisza  became  prime 
minister  for  a  second  time  in  1912  after  labor  strife  erupted  over 
an  unsuccessful  attempt  to  expand  voting  rights. 

World  War  I 

On  June  28,  1914,  a  Bosnian  Serb  assassinated  Archduke  Franz 
Ferdinand,  heir  to  the  Austrian  throne.  Within  days  Austria- 
Hungary  presented  Serbia  with  an  ultimatum  that  made  war  in- 
evitable. Tisza  initially  opposed  the  ultimatum  but  changed  his 
mind  when  Germany  supported  Austria- Hungary.  By  late  August, 
all  the  great  European  powers  were  at  war.  Bands  playing  mili- 
tary music  and  patriotic  demonstrators  expecting  a  quick,  easy  vic- 
tory took  to  Budapest's  streets  after  the  declaration  of  war. 
However,  Hungary,  was  ill  prepared  to  fight.  The  country's  ar- 
maments were  obsolete,  and  its  industries  were  not  prepared  for 
a  war  economy. 

In  1915  and  1916,  Hungary  felt  the  full  impact  of  the  war.  In- 
flation ran  rampant,  wages  were  frozen,  food  shortages  developed, 
and  the  government  banned  export  of  grain  even  to  Austria.  Franz 
Joseph  died  in  1916,  and  Karl  IV  (1916-18)  became  Hungary's 
new  king.  Before  being  crowned,  however,  Karl  insisted  that 
Hungarians  have  expanded  voting  rights.  Tisza  resigned  in

response.  By  1917  the  Hungarian  government  was  slowly  losing 
domestic  control  in  the  face  of  mounting  popular  dissatisfaction 
caused  by  the  war.  Of  the  3.6  million  soldiers  Hungary  sent  to  war, 
2.1  million  became  casualties.  By  late  1918,  Hungary's  farms  and 
factories  were  producing  only  half  of  what  they  did  in  1913,  and 
the  war- weary  people  had  abandoned  hope  of  victory. 

On  October  31,  1918,  smoldering  unrest  burst  into  revolution 
in  Budapest,  and  roving  soldiers  assassinated  Istvan  Tisza.  Pres- 
sured by  the  popular  uprising  and  the  refusal  of  Hungarian 
troops  to  quell  disturbances,  King  Karl  was  compelled  to  appoint 
the  "Red  Count,"  Mihaly  Karolyi,  a  pro-Entente  liberal  and  leader 
of  the  Party  of  Independence,  to  the  post  of  prime  minister. 
Chrysanthemum-waving  crowds  poured  into  the  streets  shouting 
their  approval.  Karolyi  formed  a  new  cabinet,  whose  members  were 
drawn  from  the  new  National  Council,  composed  of  representa- 
tives of  the  Party  of  Independence,  the  Social  Democratic  Party, 
and  a  group  of  bourgeois  radicals.  After  suing  for  a  separate  peace, 
the  new  government  dissolved  the  parliament,  pronounced  Hun- 
gary an  independent  republic  with  Karolyi  as  provisional  presi- 
dent, and  proclaimed  universal  suffrage  and  freedom  of  the  press 
and  assembly.  The  government  launched  preparations  for  land  re- 
form and  promised  elections,  but  neither  goal  was  carried  out.  On 
November  13,  1918,  Karl  IV  surrendered  his  powers  as  king  of 
Hungary;  however,  he  did  not  abdicate,  a  technicality  that  made 
a  return  to  the  throne  possible. 

The  Karolyi  government's  measures  failed  to  stem  popular  dis- 
content, especially  when  the  Entente  powers  began  distributing  slices 
of  Hungary's  traditional  territory  to  Romania,  Yugoslavia,  and 
Czechoslovakia.  The  new  government  and  its  supporters  had  pinned 
their  hopes  for  maintaining  Hungary's  territorial  integrity  on  aban- 
doning Austria  and  Germany,  securing  a  separate  peace,  and  ex- 
ploiting Karolyi 's  close  connections  in  France.  The  Entente, 
however,  chose  to  consider  Hungary  a  partner  in  the  defeated  Dual 
Monarchy  and  dashed  the  Hungarians'  hopes  with  the  delivery 
of  each  new  diplomatic  note  demanding  surrender  of  more  land. 
On  March  19,  1919,  the  French  head  of  the  Entente  mission  in 
Budapest  handed  Karolyi  a  note  delineating  final  postwar  bound- 
aries, which  were  unacceptable  to  all  Hungarians.  Karolyi  resigned 
and  turned  power  over  to  a  coalition  of  Social  Democrats  and  com- 
munists, who  promised  that  Soviet  Russia  would  help  Hungary 
restore  its  original  borders.  Although  the  Social  Democrats  held 
a  majority  in  the  coalition,  the  communists  under  Bela  Kun  im- 
mediately seized  control  and  announced  the  establishment  of  the 
Hungarian  Soviet  Republic.

Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


Hungarian  Soviet  Republic 

The  rise  of  the  Hungarian  Communist  Party  (HCP)  to  power 
was  swift.  The  party  was  organized  in  a  Moscow  hotel  on  Novem- 
ber 4,  1918,  when  a  group  of  Hungarian  prisoners  of  war  and  com- 
munist sympathizers  formed  a  Central  Committee  and  dispatched 
members  to  Hungary  to  recruit  new  members,  propagate  the  party's 
ideas,  and  radicalize  Karolyi's  government.  By  February  1919,  the 
party  numbered  30,000  to  40,000  members,  including  many 
unemployed  ex- soldiers,  young  intellectuals,  and  Jews.  In  the  same 
month,  Kun  was  imprisoned  for  incitement  to  riot,  but  his  popular- 
ity skyrocketed  when  a  journalist  reported  that  he  had  been  beaten 
by  the  police.  Kun  emerged  from  jail  triumphant  when  the  Social 
Democrats  handed  power  to  a  government  of  ''People's  Com- 
missars," who  proclaimed  the  Hungarian  Soviet  Republic  on 
March  21,  1919. 

The  communists  wrote  a  temporary  constitution  guaranteeing 
freedom  of  speech  and  assembly;  free  education;  language  and  cul- 
tural rights  to  minorities;  and  other  rights.  It  also  provided  for 
suffrage  for  people  over  eighteen  years  of  age  except  clergy,  "former 
exploiters,"  and  certain  others.  Single-list  elections  took  place  in 
April,  but  members  of  the  parliament  were  selected  indirectly  by 
popularly  elected  committees.  On  June  25,  Kun's  government 
proclaimed  a  dictatorship  of  the  proletariat,  nationalized  industrial 
and  commercial  enterprises,  and  socialized  housing,  transport, 
banking,  medicine,  cultural  institutions,  and  all  landholdings  of 
more  than  40.5  hectares.  Kun  undertook  these  measures  even 
though  the  Hungarian  communists  were  relatively  few,  and  the 
support  they  enjoyed  was  based  far  more  on  their  program  to  re- 
store Hungary's  borders  than  on  their  revolutionary  agenda.  Kun 
hoped  that  the  Soviet  Russian  government  would  intervene  on  Hun- 
gary's  behalf  and  believed  that  a  worldwide  workers'  revolution 
was  imminent.  In  an  effort  to  secure  its  rule  in  the  interim,  the 
communist  government  resorted  to  arbitrary  violence.  Revolution- 
ary tribunals  ordered  about  590  executions,  including  some  for 
"crimes  against  the  revolution."  The  government  also  used  "red 
terror"  to  expropriate  grain  from  peasants.  This  violence  and  the 
regime's  moves  against  the  clergy  also  shocked  many  Hungarians. 

In  late  May,  Kun  attempted  to  fulfill  his  promise  to  restore  Hun- 
gary's borders.  The  Hungarian  Red  Army  marched  northward  and 
reoccupied  part  of  Slovakia.  Despite  initial  military  success, 
however,  Kun  withdrew  his  troops  about  three  weeks  later  when 
the  French  threatened  to  intervene.  This  concession  shook  his 
popular  support.  Kun  then  unsuccessfully  turned  the  Hungarian

Red  Army  on  the  Romanians,  who  broke  through  Hungarian  lines 
on  July  30,  occupied  and  looted  Budapest,  and  ousted  Kun's  Soviet 
Republic  on  August  1,  1919.  Kun  fled  first  to  Vienna  and  then 
to  Soviet  Russia,  where  he  was  executed  during  Stalin's  terror 
against  foreign  communists  in  the  late  1930s. 

Counterrevolution 

A  militantiy  anticommunist  authoritarian  government  composed 
of  military  officers  entered  Budapest  on  the  heels  of  the  Romani- 
ans. A  "white  terror"  ensued  that  led  to  the  imprisonment,  tor- 
ture, and  execution  without  trial  of  communists,  socialists,  Jews, 
leftist  intellectuals,  sympathizers  with  the  Karolyi  and  Kun  regimes, 
and  others  who  threatened  the  traditional  Hungarian  political  order 
that  the  officers  sought  to  reestablish.  Estimates  placed  the  num- 
ber of  executions  at  approximately  5,000.  In  addition,  about  75,000 
people  were  jailed.  In  particular,  the  Hungarian  right  wing  and 
the  Romanian  forces  targeted  Jews  for  retribution.  Ultimately,  the 
white  terror  forced  nearly  100,000  people  to  leave  the  country,  most 
of  them  socialists,  intellectuals,  and  middle-class  Jews. 

Trianon  Hungary 

After  World  War  I,  a  conservative  government  ruled  Hungary 
and  made  some  progress  toward  economic  modernization.  The 
Great  Depression,  however,  brought  economic  collapse,  and  the 
country's  mood  shifted  to  the  far  right.  An  alliance  with  Nazi  Ger- 
many resulted,  and  Hungary  fought  on  the  Axis  side  in  World  War 
II.  Again  Hungary  experienced  defeat,  and  the  country  was  oc- 
cupied by  the  Soviet  Red  Army. 

Postwar  Political  and  Economic  Conditions 

In  1920  and  1921,  internal  chaos  racked  Hungary.  The  white 
terror  continued  to  plague  Jews  and  leftists,  unemployment  and 
inflation  soared,  and  penniless  Hungarian  refugees  poured  across 
the  border  from  neighboring  countries  and  burdened  the  floun- 
dering economy.  The  government  offered  the  population  littie  suc- 
cor. In  January  1920,  Hungarian  men  and  women  cast  the  first 
secret  ballots  in  the  country's  political  history  and  elected  a  large 
counterrevolutionary  and  agrarian  majority  to  a  unicameral  parlia- 
ment. Two  main  political  parties  emerged:  the  socially  conserva- 
tive Christian  National  Union  and  the  Smallholders'  Party,  which 
advocated  land  reform.  In  March  the  parliament  annulled  both 
the  Pragmatic  Sanction  of  1723  and  the  Compromise  of  1867, 
and  it  restored  the  Hungarian  monarchy  but  postponed  electing 
a  king  until  civil  disorder  had  subsided.  Instead,  Miklos  Horthy 


37 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


(1920-44) — a  former  commander  in  chief  of  the  Austro- Hungarian 
navy — was  elected  regent  and  was  empowered,  among  other  things, 
to  appoint  Hungary's  prime  minister,  veto  legislation,  convene  or 
dissolve  the  parliament,  and  command  the  armed  forces. 

Hungary's  signing  of  the  Treaty  of  Trianon  on  June  4,  1920, 
ratified  the  country's  dismemberment,  limited  the  size  of  its  armed 
forces,  and  required  reparations  payments.  The  territorial  provi- 
sions of  the  treaty,  which  ensured  continued  discord  between  Hun- 
gary and  its  neighbors,  required  the  Hungarians  to  surrender  more 
than  two-thirds  of  their  prewar  lands  (see  fig.  5).  Romania  acquired 
Transylvania;  Yugoslavia  gained  Croatia,  Slavonia,  and  Vojvo- 
dina;  Slovakia  became  a  part  of  Czechoslovakia;  and  Austria  also 
acquired  a  small  piece  of  prewar  Hungarian  territory.  Hungary 
lost  about  60  percent  of  its  prewar  population,  and  about  one-third 
of  the  10  million  ethnic  Hungarians  found  themselves  outside  the 
diminished  homeland.  The  country's  ethnic  composition  was  left 
almost  homogeneous.  Hungarians  constituted  about  90  percent  of 
the  population,  Germans  made  up  about  6  to  8  percent,  and  Slo- 
vaks, Croats,  Romanians,  Jews,  and  other  minorities  accounted 
for  the  remainder. 

New  international  borders  separated  Hungary's  industrial  base 
from  its  sources  of  raw  materials  and  its  former  markets  for  agricul- 
tural and  industrial  products.  Its  new  circumstances  forced  Hun- 
gary to  become  a  trading  nation.  Hungary  lost  84  percent  of  its 
timber  resources,  43  percent  of  its  arable  land,  and  83  percent  of 
its  iron  ore.  Because  most  of  the  country's  prewar  industry  was 
concentrated  near  Budapest,  Hungary  retained  about  51  percent 
of  its  industrial  population,  56  percent  of  its  industry,  82  percent 
of  its  heavy  industry,  and  70  percent  of  its  banks. 

Bethlen  Government 

Horthy  appointed  Pal  Teleki  prime  minister  in  July  1920.  His 
right-wing  government  set  quotas  effectively  limiting  admission  of 
Jews  to  universities,  legalized  corporal  punishment,  and,  to  quiet 
rural  discontent,  took  initial  steps  toward  fulfilling  a  promise  of  major 
land  reform  by  dividing  about  385,000  hectares  from  the  largest  es- 
tates into  smallholdings.  Teleki' s  government  resigned,  however, 
after  the  former  emperor,  Karl  IV,  unsuccessfully  attempted  to  re- 
take Hungary's  throne  in  March  1921 .  King  Karl's  return  marked 
a  split  between  conservatives  who  favored  a  Habsburg  restora- 
tion and  nationalist  right-wing  radicals  who  supported  election 
of  a  Hungarian  king.  Istvan  Bethlen,  a  nonaffiliated,  right-wing 
member  of  the  parliament,  took  advantage  of  this  rift  by  convinc- 
ing members  of  the  Christian  National  Union  who  opposed  Karl's 


38 


Historical  Setting 


reenthronement  to  merge  with  the  Smallholders'  Party  and  form 
a  new  Party  of  Unity  with  Bethlen  as  its  leader.  Horthy  then  ap- 
pointed Bethlen  prime  minister. 

As  prime  minister,  Bethlen  dominated  Hungarian  politics  be- 
tween 1921  and  1931 .  He  fashioned  a  political  machine  by  amend- 
ing the  electoral  law,  eliminating  peasants  from  the  Party  of  Unity, 
providing  jobs  in  the  bureaucracy  to  his  supporters,  and  manipulat- 
ing elections  in  rural  areas.  Bethlen  restored  order  to  the  country 
by  giving  the  radical  counterrevolutionaries  payoffs  and  govern- 
ment jobs  in  exchange  for  ceasing  their  campaign  of  terror  against 
Jews  and  leftists.  In  1921  Bethlen  made  a  deal  with  the  Social 
Democrats  and  trade  unions,  agreeing,  among  other  things,  to  legal- 
ize their  activities  and  free  political  prisoners  in  return  for  their 
pledge  to  refrain  from  spreading  anti- Hungarian  propaganda,  call- 
ing political  strikes,  and  organizing  the  peasantry.  In  May  1922, 
the  Party  of  Unity  captured  a  large  parliamentary  majority.  Karl 
IV s  death,  soon  after  he  failed  a  second  time  to  reclaim  the  throne 
in  October  1921,  allowed  the  revision  of  the  Treaty  of  Trianon 
to  rise  to  the  top  of  Hungary's  political  agenda.  Bethlen's  strategy 
to  win  the  treaty's  revision  was  first  to  strengthen  his  country's 
economy  and  then  to  build  relations  with  stronger  nations  that  could 
further  Hungary's  goals.  Revision  of  the  treaty  had  such  a  broad 
backing  in  Hungary  that  Bethlen  used  it,  at  least  in  part,  to  deflect 
criticism  of  his  economic,  social,  and  political  policies.  However, 
Bethlen's  only  foreign  policy  success  was  a  treaty  of  friendship  with 
Italy  in  1927,  which  had  little  immediate  impact. 

Economic  Development 

When  Bethlen  took  office,  the  government  was  bankrupt.  Tax 
revenues  were  so  paltry  that  he  turned  to  domestic  gold  and  foreign- 
currency  reserves  to  meet  about  half  of  the  1921-22  budget  and 
almost  80  percent  of  the  1922-23  budget.  To  improve  his  coun- 
try's economic  circumstances,  Bethlen  undertook  development  of 
industry.  He  imposed  tariffs  on  finished  goods  and  earmarked  the 
revenues  to  subsidize  new  industries.  Bethlen  squeezed  the  agricul- 
tural sector  to  increase  cereal  exports,  which  generated  foreign  cur- 
rency to  pay  for  imports  critical  to  the  industrial  sector.  In  1924, 
after  the  white  terror  had  waned  and  Hungary  had  gained  admis- 
sion to  the  League  of  Nations  (1922),  the  Bethlen  government  se- 
cured a  US$50  million  reconstruction  loan  from  the  league,  which 
restored  the  confidence  of  foreign  creditors.  Foreign  loans  and 
domestic  capital  that  had  been  removed  from  Hungary  during  the 
communist  revolution  flowed  back  into  the  country,  further  fuel- 
ing industrial  development.

Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


Historical  Setting 


By  the  late  1920s,  Bethlen's  policies  had  brought  order  to  the 
economy.  The  number  of  factories  increased  by  about  66  percent, 
inflation  subsided,  and  the  national  income  climbed  20  percent. 
However,  the  apparent  stability  was  supported  by  a  rickety  frame- 
work of  constantly  revolving  foreign  credits  and  high  world  grain 
prices;  therefore,  Hungary  remained  undeveloped  in  comparison 
with  the  wealthier  western  European  countries. 

Despite  economic  progress,  the  workers'  standard  of  living  re- 
mained poor,  and  consequently  the  working  class  never  gave  Beth- 
len  its  political  support.  The  peasants  fared  worse  than  the  working 
class  (see  Interwar  Period,  ch.  2).  In  the  1920s,  about  60  percent 
of  the  peasants  were  either  landless  or  were  cultivating  plots  too 
small  to  provide  a  decent  living.  Real  wages  for  agricultural  work- 
ers remained  below  prewar  levels,  and  the  peasants  had  practically 
no  political  voice.  Moreover,  once  Bethlen  had  consolidated  his 
power,  he  ignored  calls  for  land  reform.  The  industrial  sector  failed 
to  expand  fast  enough  to  provide  jobs  for  all  the  peasants  and  univer- 
sity graduates  seeking  work.  Most  peasants  lingered  in  the  villages, 
and  in  the  1930s  Hungarians  in  rural  areas  were  extremely  dis- 
satisfied. Hungary's  foreign  debt  ballooned  as  Bethlen  expanded 
the  bureaucracy  to  absorb  the  university  graduates  who,  if  left  idle, 
might  have  threatened  civil  order. 

The  Great  Depression 

In  1929  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  crashed.  As  a  result,  world 
grain  prices  plummeted,  and  the  framework  supporting  Hungary's 
economy  buckled.  Hungary's  earnings  from  grain  exports  declined 
as  prices  and  volume  dropped,  tax  revenues  fell,  foreign  credit 
sources  dried  up,  and  short-term  loans  were  called  in.  Hungary 
sought  financial  relief  from  the  League  of  Nations,  which  insisted 
on  a  program  of  rigid  fiscal  belt-tightening,  resulting  in  increased 
unemployment.  The  peasants  reverted  to  subsistence  farming.  In- 
dustrial production  rapidly  dropped,  and  businesses  went  bankrupt 
as  domestic  and  foreign  demand  evaporated.  Government  workers 
lost  their  jobs  or  suffered  severe  pay  cuts.  By  1933  about  18  per- 
cent of  Budapest's  citizens  lived  in  poverty.  Unemployment  leaped 
from  5  percent  in  1928  to  almost  36  percent  by  1933. 

As  the  standard  of  living  dropped,  the  political  mood  of  the  coun- 
try shifted  further  toward  the  right.  Bethlen  resigned  without  warn- 
ing amid  national  turmoil  in  August  1931.  His  successor,  Gyula 
Karolyi,  failed  to  quell  the  crisis.  Horthy  then  appointed  a  reac- 
tionary demagogue,  Gyula  Gombos,  but  only  after  Gombos  agreed 
to  maintain  the  existing  political  system,  to  refrain  from  calling 
elections  before  the  parliament's  term  had  expired,  and  to  appoint 


41

several  Bethlen  supporters  to  head  key  ministries.  Gombos  pub- 
licly renounced  the  vehement  anti-Semitism  he  had  espoused  earlier, 
and  his  party  and  government  included  some  Jews. 

Radical  Right  in  Power 

Gombos' s  appointment  marked  the  beginning  of  the  radical 
right's  ascendancy  in  Hungarian  politics,  which  lasted  with  few 
interruptions  until  1945.  The  radical  right  garnered  its  support  from 
medium  and  small  farmers,  former  refugees  from  Hungary's  lost 
territories,  and  unemployed  civil  servants,  army  officers,  and  uni- 
versity graduates.  Gombos  advocated  a  one-party  government, 
revision  of  the  Treaty  of  Trianon,  withdrawal  from  the  League  of 
Nations,  anti-intellectualism,  and  social  reform.  He  assembled  a 
political  machine,  but  his  efforts  to  fashion  a  one-party  state  and 
fulfill  his  reform  platform  were  frustrated  by  a  parliament  com- 
posed mostly  of  Bethlen's  supporters  and  by  Hungary's  creditors, 
who  forced  Gombos  to  follow  conventional  policies  in  dealing  with 
the  economic  and  financial  crisis.  The  1935  elections  gave  Gombos 
more  solid  support  in  the  parliament,  and  he  succeeded  in  gaining 
control  of  the  ministries  of  finance,  industry,  and  defense  and  in 
replacing  several  key  military  officers  with  his  supporters.  In  Sep- 
tember 1936,  Gombos  informed  German  officials  that  he  would 
establish  a  Nazi-like,  one-party  government  in  Hungary  within  two 
years,  but  he  died  in  October  without  realizing  this  goal. 

In  foreign  affairs,  Gombos  led  Hungary  toward  close  relations 
with  Italy  and  Germany;  in  fact,  Gombos  coined  the  term  Axis, 
which  was  later  adopted  by  the  German-Italian  military  alliance. 
Soon  after  his  appointment,  Gombos  visited  Italian  dictator  Benito 
Mussolini  and  gained  his  support  for  revision  of  the  Treaty  of 
Trianon.  Later,  Gombos  became  the  first  foreign  head  of  govern- 
ment to  visit  German  chancellor  Adolf  Hitier.  For  a  time,  Hungary 
profited  handsomely,  as  Gombos  signed  a  trade  agreement  with 
Germany  that  drew  Hungary's  economy  out  of  depression  but  made 
Hungary  dependent  on  the  German  economy  for  both  raw  materials 
and  markets.  In  1928  Germany  had  accounted  for  19.5  percent 
of  Hungary's  imports  and  11.7  percent  of  its  exports;  by  1939  the 
figures  were  52.5  percent  and  52.2  percent,  respectively.  Hungary's 
annual  rate  of  economic  growth  from  1934  to  1940  averaged  10.8 
percent.  The  number  of  workers  in  industry  doubled  in  the  ten 
years  after  1933,  and  the  number  of  agricultural  workers  dropped 
below  50  percent  for  the  first  time  in  the  country's  history.  Hun- 
gary also  used  its  relationship  with  Germany  to  chip  away  at  the 
Treaty  of  Trianon.  In  1938  Hungary  openly  repudiated  the  treaty's 
restrictions  on  its  armed  forces.  With  German  help,  Hungary

extended  its  territory  four  times  and  doubled  in  size  from  1938  to 
1941.  It  regained  parts  of  southern  Slovakia  in  1938,  Carpatho- 
Ukraine  in  1939,  northern  Transylvania  in  1940,  and  parts  of 
Vojvodina  in  1941. 

Hitler's  assistance  did  not  come  without  a  price.  After  1938  the 
Fiihrer  used  promises  of  additional  territories,  economic  pressure, 
and  threats  of  military  intervention  to  pressure  the  Hungarians  into 
supporting  his  policies,  including  those  related  to  Europe's  Jews, 
which  encouraged  Hungary's  anti-Semites.  The  percentage  of  Jews 
in  business,  finance,  and  the  professions  far  exceeded  the  percen- 
tage of  Jews  in  the  overall  population.  The  1930  census  showed 
that  Jews  made  up  only  5.1  percent  of  the  population  but  provided 
54.5  percent  of  its  physicians,  31.7  percent  of  its  journalists,  and 
49.2  percent  of  its  lawyers.  Jews  controlled  an  estimated  19.5  per- 
cent to  33  percent  of  the  national  income,  four  of  the  five  leading 
banks,  and  80  percent  of  Hungary's  industry.  After  the  depres- 
sion struck,  anti-Semites  made  the  Jews  scapegoats  for  Hungary's 
economic  plight. 

Hungary's  Jews  suffered  the  first  blows  of  this  renewed  anti- 
Semitism  during  the  government  of  Gombos's  successor,  Kalman 
Daranyi,  who  fashioned  a  coalition  of  conservatives  and  reactionaries 


43

and  dismantled  Gombos's  political  machine.  After  Horthy  pub- 
licly dashed  hopes  of  land  reform,  discontented  right-wingers  took 
to  the  streets  denouncing  the  government  and  baiting  the  Jews. 
Daranyi's  government  attempted  to  appease  the  anti-Semites  and 
the  Nazis  by  proposing  and  passing  the  first  so-called  Jewish  Law, 
which  set  quotas  limiting  Jews  to  20  percent  of  the  positions  in  cer- 
tain businesses  and  professions.  The  law  failed  to  satisfy  Hungary's 
anti-Semitic  radicals,  however,  and  when  Daranyi  tried  to  appease 
them  again,  Horthy  unseated  him  in  1938.  The  regent  then  ap- 
pointed the  ill-starred  Bela  Imredy,  who  drafted  a  second,  harsher 
Jewish  Law  before  political  opponents  forced  his  resignation  in 
February  1939  by  presenting  documents  showing  that  Imredy's 
own  grandfather  was  a  Jew. 

Imredy's  downfall  led  to  Pal  Teleki's  return  to  the  prime 
minister's  office.  Teleki  dissolved  some  of  the  fascist  parties  but 
did  not  alter  the  fundamental  policies  of  his  predecessors.  He 
undertook  a  bureaucratic  reform  and  launched  cultural  and  educa- 
tional programs  to  help  the  rural  poor.  Illiteracy  dropped  to  about 
7  percent  by  1941.  But  Teleki  also  oversaw  passage  of  the  second 
Jewish  Law,  which  broadened  the  definition  of '  'Jewishness,"  cut 
the  quotas  on  Jews  permitted  in  the  professions  and  in  business, 
and  required  that  the  quotas  be  attained  by  the  hiring  of  Gentiles 
or  the  firing  of  Jews.  By  the  June  1939  elections,  Hungarian  pub- 
lic opinion  had  shifted  so  far  to  the  right  that  voters  gave  the  Arrow 
Cross  Party — Hungary's  equivalent  of  Germany's  National  So- 
cialist German  Workers'  Party  (the  Nazi  Party) — the  second  highest 
number  of  votes.  In  September  1940,  the  Hungarian  government 
allowed  German  troops  to  transit  the  country  on  their  way  to  Roma- 
nia, and  on  November  20,  1940,  Hungary  signed  the  Tripartite 
Pact,  which  allied  Germany,  Italy,  and  Japan. 

World  War  II 

In  December  1940,  Teleki  signed  a  short-lived  Treaty  of  Eter- 
nal Friendship  with  Yugoslavia.  The  Yugoslav  government, 
however,  was  overthrown  on  March  27,  1941,  two  days  after  it 
succumbed  to  German  and  Italian  pressure  and  joined  the  pact. 
Hitler  considered  the  overthrow  a  hostile  act  and  grounds  to  in- 
vade. Again  promising  territory  in  exchange  for  cooperation,  he 
asked  Hungary  to  join  the  invasion  by  contributing  troops  and 
allowing  the  Wehrmacht  (German  armed  forces)  to  march  through 
its  territory.  Unable  to  prevent  the  invasion,  Teleki  committed  sui- 
cide on  April  3.  Three  days  later,  the  Luftwaffe  mercilessly  bombed 
Belgrade  without  warning,  and  German  troops  invaded.  Shortly 
thereafter,  Horthy  dispatched  Hungarian  military  forces  to  occupy 


44

former  Hungarian  lands  in  Yugoslavia,  and  Hungary  eventually 
annexed  sections  of  Vojvodina. 

Horthy  named  the  right-wing  radical  Laszlo  Bardossy  to  suc- 
ceed Teleki.  Bardossy  was  convinced  that  Germany  would  win  the 
war  and  sought  to  maintain  Hungary's  independence  by  appeas- 
ing Hitler.  Hitler  tricked  Horthy  into  committing  Hungary  to  join 
his  invasion  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  June  1941,  and  Hungary  en- 
tered the  war  against  the  Western  Allies  the  following  December. 
In  July  1941,  the  government  deported  the  first  40,000  Jews  from 
Hungary,  and  six  months  later  Hungarian  troops,  in  reprisal  for 
resistance  activities,  murdered  3,000  Serbian  and  Jewish  hos- 
tages near  Novi  Sad  in  Yugoslavia.  By  the  winter  of  1941-42, 
German  hopes  of  a  quick  victory  over  the  Soviet  Union  had  faded. 
In  January  the  German  foreign  minister  visited  Budapest  asking 
for  additional  mobilization  of  Hungarian  forces  for  a  planned  spring 
offensive  and  promising  in  return  to  hand  Hungary  some  terri- 
tory in  Transylvania.  Bardossy  agreed  and  committed  one-third 
of  Hungary's  military  forces. 

Horthy  grew  dissatisfied  with  Bardossy,  who  resigned  in  March 
1942,  and  named  Miklos  Kallay,  a  conservative  veteran  of  Beth- 
len's  government,  who  aimed  to  free  Hungary  from  the  Nazis'  grip. 
Kallay  faced  a  terrible  dilemma:  if  he  broke  with  Hitler  and 
negotiated  a  separate  peace,  the  Germans  would  occupy  Hungary 
immediately;  but  if  he  supported  the  Germans,  he  would  encourage 
further  pro-Nazi  excesses.  Kallay  chose  duplicity.  In  1942  and  1943, 
pro-Western  Hungarian  government  officials  promised  British  and 
American  diplomats  that  the  Hungarians  would  not  fire  on  their 
aircraft,  sparing  for  a  time  Hungarian  cities  from  bombardment. 

In  January  1943,  the  Soviet  Red  Army  annihilated  Hungary's 
Second  Army  during  the  massive  counterattack  on  the  Axis  troops 
besieging  Stalingrad.  In  the  fighting,  Soviet  troops  killed  an  esti- 
mated 40,000  Hungarians  and  wounded  70,000.  As  anti-Axis  pres- 
sure in  Hungary  mounted,  Kallay  withdrew  the  remnants  of  the 
force  into  Hungary  in  April  1943,  and  only  a  nominal  number  of 
poorly  armed  troops  remained  of  the  country's  military  contribu- 
tion to  the  Axis  Powers.  Aware  of  Kallay 's  deceit  and  fearing  that 
Hungary  might  conclude  a  separate  peace,  Hitler  ordered  Nazi 
troops  to  occupy  Hungary  and  force  its  government  to  increase 
its  contribution  to  the  war  effort.  Kallay  took  asylum  in  the  Tur- 
kish legation.  Dome  Sztojay,  a  supporter  of  the  Nazis,  became  the 
new  prime  minister.  His  government  jailed  political  leaders,  dis- 
solved the  labor  unions,  and  resumed  the  deportation  of  Hungary's 
Jews. 


45 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


While  Kallay  was  prime  minister,  the  Jews  endured  economic 
and  political  repression,  but  the  government  protected  them  from 
the  "final  solution."  The  government  expropriated  Jewish  property; 
banned  the  purchase  of  real  estate  by  Jews;  barred  Jews  from  work- 
ing as  publishers,  theater  directors,  and  editors  of  journals; 
proscribed  sexual  relations  between  Jews  and  non-Jews;  and  out- 
lawed conversion  to  Judaism.  But  when  the  Nazis  occupied  Hun- 
gary in  March  1944,  the  deportation  of  the  Jews  to  the  death  camps 
in  Poland  began.  Horthy  used  the  confusion  after  the  July  20,  1944, 
attempt  to  assassinate  Hitier  to  replace  Sztojay  in  August  1944  with 
General  Geza  Lakatos  and  halt  the  deportation  of  Jews  from 
Budapest.  Of  the  approximately  725,000  Jews  residing  within  Hun- 
gary's expanded  borders  of  1941,  only  about  260,500,  mostly  from 
Budapest,  survived. 

In  September,  Soviet  forces  crossed  the  border,  and  on  October 
15  Horthy  announced  that  Hungary  had  signed  an  armistice  with 
the  Soviet  Union.  However,  the  Germans  abducted  the  regent  and 
forced  him  to  abrogate  the  armistice,  depose  the  Lakatos  govern- 
ment, and  name  Ferenc  Szalasi — the  leader  of  the  Arrow  Cross 
Party — prime  minister.  Horthy  abdicated,  and  soon  the  country 
became  a  battlefield.  Hungary  was  sacked  first  by  the  retreating 
Germans,  who  demolished  the  rail,  road,  and  communications  sys- 
tems, then  by  the  advancing  Soviet  Red  Army,  which  found  the 
country  in  a  state  of  political  chaos.  Germans  held  off  the  Soviet 
troops  near  Budapest  for  seven  weeks  before  the  defenses  collapsed, 
and  on  April  4,  1945,  the  last  German  troops  were  driven  out  of 
Hungary. 

Postwar  Hungary 

In  the  aftermath  of  World  War  II,  a  victorious  Soviet  Union 
succeeded  in  forcing  its  political,  social,  and  economic  system  on 
Eastern  Europe,  including  Hungary.  But  the  Hungarians  never 
reconciled  themselves  to  Soviet  hegemony  over  their  country  and 
rebelled  against  the  Soviet  Union  and  its  Hungarian  vassals  in  1956. 
That  revolution  was  crushed  by  Soviet  tanks,  but  it  brought  to 
power  Janos  Kadar.  who  then  attempted  to  institute  a  milder  form 
of  communist  rule. 

Coalition  Government  and  Communist  Takeover 

The  Hungarian  Communist  Party  (HCP)  enjoyed  scant  popu- 
lar support  after  the  toppling  of  Bela  Kun's  short-lived  Hungar- 
ian Soviet  Republic  in  1919  and  the  subsequent  white  terror.  During 
World  War  II.  a  communist  cell  headed  by  Laszlo  Rajk,  a  veteran 


46 


Historical  Setting 


of  the  Spanish  Civil  War  (1936-39)  and  a  former  communist  student 
leader,  operated  underground  within  the  country.  Matyas  Rakosi 
led  a  second,  Moscow-based  group  whose  members  were  later  called 
the  "Muscovites."  After  the  Soviet  Red  Army  invaded  Hungary 
in  September  1944,  Rajk's  organization  emerged  from  hiding,  and 
the  Muscovites  returned  to  their  homeland.  Rakosi 's  close  ties  with 
the  Soviet  occupiers  enhanced  his  influence  within  the  party,  and 
a  rivalry  developed  between  the  Muscovites  and  Rajk's  followers. 
Between  the  invasion  and  the  end  of  the  war,  party  membership 
rose  significantly.  Although  party  rolls  listed  only  about  3,000  names 
in  November  1944,  membership  had  swelled  to  about  500,000  by 
October  1945. 

Hungary's  postwar  political  order  began  to  take  shape  even  before 
Germany's  surrender.  In  October  1944,  Britain's  Prime  Minister 
Winston  Churchill  and  Foreign  Minister  Anthony  Eden  agreed  with 
Stalin  that  after  the  war  the  Soviet  Union  would  enjoy  a  75  per- 
cent to  80  percent  influence  in  Hungary,  Bulgaria,  and  Romania, 
while  the  British  would  have  a  20  percent  to  25  percent  share.  On 
December  22,  1944,  a  provisional  government  emerged  in  Debre- 
cen that  was  made  up  of  the  Provisional  National  Assembly,  in 
which  communist  representatives  outnumbered  those  of  the  other 
"antifascist"  parties,  and  a  cabinet,  whose  members  included  a 
general  and  two  other  military  officers  of  the  old  regime,  two  com- 
munists, two  Social  Democrats,  two  members  of  the  Smallholders' 
Party,  one  member  of  the  National  Peasant  Party,  and  one  un- 
affiliated member.  The  provisional  government  concluded  an  ar- 
mistice with  the  Soviet  Union  on  January  20,  1945,  while  fighting 
still  raged  in  the  western  part  of  the  country.  The  armistice  estab- 
lished the  Allied  Control  Commission,  with  Soviet,  American,  and 
British  representatives,  which  held  complete  sovereignty  over 
the  country.  The  commission's  chairman,  Marshal  Kliment 
Voroshilov,  a  member  of  Stalin's  inner  circle,  exercised  absolute 
control. 

Stalin  decided  against  an  immediate  communist  seizure  of  power 
in  Hungary;  rather,  he  instructed  HCP  leaders  to  take  a  gradu- 
alist approach  and  share  power  with  other  parties  in  freely  elected 
coalition  governments.  Stalin  informed  Rakosi  that  a  communist 
takeover  would  be  delayed  ten  to  fifteen  years  in  order  to  deflect 
Western  criticism  of  rapid  communist  takeovers  in  Poland,  Bul- 
garia, Romania,  and  the  Soviet  zone  of  Germany.  Stalin  desired 
a  quick  return  to  normal  economic  activity  to  rebuild  the  Soviet 
Union  and  sought  to  avoid  a  confrontation  with  the  Allies,  who 
still  had  troops  in  Europe.  The  members  of  the  HCP  who  had 
worked  underground  during  the  war  opposed  Stalin's  gradualist 


47 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

approach  and  argued  for  immediate  establishment  of  a  dictator- 
ship of  the  proletariat. 

In  April  1945,  after  Soviet  troops  had  rid  Hungary  of  the  Nazis, 
the  government  moved  from  Debrecen  to  Budapest,  and  a  second, 
expanded  Provisional  National  Assembly  was  chosen.  With  the  sup- 
port of  representatives  of  the  trade  unions  and  the  Social  Democratic 
Party,  the  HCP  enjoyed  an  absolute  majority  of  the  assembly's 
495  seats.  The  provisional  government  remained  in  power  until 
November  15,  1945,  when  voters  dealt  the  HCP  an  unexpected 
setback  in  a  free  election.  The  Smallholders'  Party  won  245  seats 
in  the  National  Assembly;  the  HCP,  70;  the  Social  Democratic 
Party,  69;  the  National  Peasant  Party,  21 ;  and  the  Civic  Democratic 
Party,  2.  The  National  Assembly  proclaimed  the  Hungarian 
Republic  on  February  1,  1946,  and  two  Smallholder-led  coalitions 
under  Zoltan  Tildy  and  Ferenc  Nagy  governed  the  country  until 
May  1947. 

The  HCP  soon  formed  a  leftist  alliance  with  the  Social  Democra- 
tic Party  and  the  National  Peasant  Party  and  gained  control  of  sev- 
eral key  offices,  including  the  leadership  of  the  security  police  and 
the  army  general  staff.  Voroshilov  vetoed  an  agreement  reached 
by  the  coalition  members  to  name  a  member  of  the  Smallholders' 
Party  to  head  the  Ministry  of  Interior.  A  National  Peasant  Party 
member  loyal  to  the  HCP  won  the  post  and  made  the  police  a 
powerful  tool  of  the  communists.  The  National  Assembly  under- 
mined freedoms  guaranteed  in  Hungary's  constitution  when  it 
banned  statements  that  could  be  interpreted  as  hostile  to  the 
democratic  order  or  the  country's  international  esteem.  Later,  as 
Hungary's  democratic  order  became  identified  with  HCP  policies, 
the  law  was  used  to  silence  legitimate  opponents. 

In  the  immediate  postwar  period,  the  government  pursued  eco- 
nomic reconstruction  and  land  reform  (see  Postwar  Societal  Trans- 
formation, ch.  2).  Hungary  had  been  devastated  in  the  last  years 
of  World  War  II.  About  24  percent  of  its  industrial  base  was  de- 
stroyed. Many  of  the  large  landowners  and  industrialists  fled  Hun- 
gary in  advance  of  the  Soviet  Red  Army.  Reconstruction  proceeded 
rapidly,  expedited  by  gradual  nationalization  of  mines,  electric 
plants,  the  four  largest  concerns  in  heavy  industry,  and  the  ten 
largest  banks.  In  1945  the  government  also  carried  out  a  radical 
land  reform,  expropriating  all  holdings  larger  than  fifty-seven  hec- 
tares and  distributing  them  to  the  country's  poorest  peasants. 
Nevertheless,  the  peasants  received  portions  barely  large  enough 
for  self-sufficiency.  Finally,  the  government  introduced  a  new 
currency — the  forint — to  help  curb  high  inflation. 


48 


Historical  Setting 


Using  methods  Rakosi  later  called  "salami  tactics,"  the  HCP 
strengthened  its  position  in  the  coalition  by  discrediting  leaders  of 
rival  parties  as  "reactionaries"  or  "antidemocratic,"  forcing  their 
resignation  from  the  government  and  sometimes  prompting  their 
arrest.  In  1945  ex-members  of  Horthy's  regime  lost  their  positions. 
A  year  later,  members  of  the  Smallholders'  Party  and  the  Social 
Democratic  Party  were  ousted  from  power.  In  late  1946,  leaders 
of  the  Smallholders'  Party  were  arrested.  In  1947  the  Soviet  Union 
ordered  the  arrest  of  Bela  Kovacs,  the  secretary  general  of  the  Small- 
holders' Party,  on  the  false  charge  of  plotting  to  overthrow  the 
government.  The  Smallholders'  Party  was  dissolved  after  Ferenc 
Nagy  resigned  his  position  as  prime  minister.  The  leftist  bloc  gained 
a  small  lead  over  its  rivals  in  the  1947  general  elections.  The  HCP 
tallied  only  22  percent  of  the  vote,  but  fraud  tainted  the  election, 
and  suspicions  arose  that  the  party  actually  enjoyed  less  support. 

The  Treaty  of  Paris,  signed  on  February  10,  1947,  required  Hun- 
gary to  pay  US$200  million  in  reparations  to  the  Soviet  Union, 
US$50  million  to  Czechoslovakia,  and  US$50  million  to  Yugoslavia. 
Hungary  also  had  to  transfer  a  piece  of  territory  to  Czechoslovakia, 
leaving  Hungary  with  slightly  less  territory  than  it  had  had  after 
the  Treaty  of  Trianon.  Stalin  had  already  returned  Transylvania 
to  the  Romanians  to  reinforce  the  position  of  the  procommunist 
Prime  Minister  Petru  Groza.  Thereafter,  the  Romanians'  treat- 
ment of  the  Hungarian  minority  in  Transylvania  became  an  irri- 
tant in  relations  between  the  two  countries  (see  Relations  with  Other 
Communist  Neighbors,  ch.  4). 

Rdkosi's  Rule 

In  1947  the  postwar  cooperation  between  the  Soviet  Union  and 
the  West  collapsed,  marking  the  beginning  of  the  Cold  War  and 
the  beginning  of  the  end  for  Hungary's  democratic  coalition  govern- 
ment. Having  seen  communist  parties  seize  power  in  Poland, 
Romania,  Bulgaria,  and  Yugoslavia  and  a  communist  insurgency 
threaten  Greece,  the  Western  powers  dedicated  themselves  to  con- 
taining Soviet  influence.  In  May  communists  were  expelled  from 
the  governments  of  Italy  and  France,  and  a  month  later  the  United 
States  promulgated  the  Marshall  Plan  for  the  economic  reconstruc- 
tion of  Europe,  which  was  appealing  to  the  East  European  gov- 
ernments. 

Stalin  feared  a  weakening  of  the  Soviet  Union's  grip  on  Eastern 
Europe.  Anticommunist  forces  in  the  region  remained  potent,  and 
most  of  the  communist  governments  were  unpopular.  In  addition, 
East  European  parties  began  taking  positions  independent  of 
Moscow;  for  example,  communists  in  the  Polish  and  Czechoslovak 


49 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


governments  favored  participation  in  the  Marshall  Plan,  and 
Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  broached  the  idea  of  a  Balkan  confedera- 
tion. By  September  Stalin  had  abandoned  gradualism  and  reversed 
his  earlier  advocacy  of  independent,  "national  roads  to  socialism." 
He  now  pushed  for  tighter  adherence  to  Moscow's  line  and  rapid 
establishment  of  Soviet-dominated  communist  states  in  Hungary 
and  elsewhere.  The  policy  shift  was  indicated  in  September  1947 
at  the  founding  meeting  of  the  Cominform,  an  organization  link- 
ing the  Soviet  communist  party  with  the  communist  parties  of 
Eastern  Europe,  France,  and  Italy. 

The  HCP  proceeded  swifdy  to  assume  full  control  of  the  govern- 
ment. First  Secretary  Rakosi  became  the  country's  most  powerful 
official  and  dictated  major  political  and  economic  changes.  In 
October  1947,  noncommunist  political  figures  were  told  to  cooperate 
with  a  new  coalition  government  or  leave  the  country.  In  June  1948, 
the  Social  Democratic  Party  merged  with  the  HCP,  forming  the 
Hungarian  Workers'  Party  (HWP).  In  1949  the  regime  held  a 
single-list  election,  and  on  August  20  of  that  year  the  government 
ratified  a  Soviet-style  constitution  (see  Constitution  of  1949,  ch.  4). 
The  official  name  of  the  country  became  the  Hungarian  People's 
Republic,  and  the  HWP's  control  of  the  government  was  assured. 
In  1952  Rakosi  also  became  prime  minister. 

In  1948  Yugoslavia  was  expelled  from  the  Cominform,  and  the 
Soviet- Yugoslav  rift  broke  into  the  open.  Almost  overnight  it  be- 
came treasonous  for  communists  to  display  any  approval  of  Yugo- 
slav leader  Josip  Broz  Tito  or  to  advocate  national  roads  to 
socialism.  Beginning  in  1949,  the  Soviet  Union  unleashed  a  four- 
year  reign  of  terror  against  "Titoists"  in  Eastern  Europe.  Rakosi 
purged  members  of  the  party's  wartime  underground,  potential 
rivals,  and  hundreds  of  others.  Rajk,  who  continued  to  support 
a  Hungarian  road  to  socialism,  "confessed"  to  being  a  Titoist  and 
a  fascist  spy  and  was  hanged  in  1950.  Another  victim  was  future 
party  chief  Janos  Kadar,  who  was  jailed  and  tortured  for  three  years. 

Between  1948  and  1953,  the  Hungarian  economy  was  reor- 
ganized according  to  the  Soviet  model  (see  Economic  Policy  and 
Performance,  1945-85,  ch.  3).  In  a  campaign  reminiscent  of  the 
Soviet  Union's  forced  collectivization  of  agriculture  in  the  1930s, 
the  regime  compelled  most  peasants  to  join  collective  farms  and 
required  them  to  make  deliveries  to  the  government  at  prices  lower 
than  the  cost  of  production.  The  regime  accelerated  nationaliza- 
tion of  banking,  trade,  and  industry,  and  by  December  1949  nearly 
99  percent  of  the  country's  workers  had  become  state  employees. 
The  trade  unions  lost  their  independence,  and  the  government  in- 
troduced Soviet-style  central  planning.  Planners  neglected  the 


50 


Historical  Setting 


production  of  consumer  goods  to  focus  on  investment  in  heavy  in- 
dustry, especially  steel  production,  and  economic  self-sufficiency. 
In  January  1949,  Hungary  joined  the  Council  for  Mutual  Eco- 
nomic Assistance  (Comecon — see  Glossary),  an  organization 
designed  to  further  economic  cooperation  among  the  Soviet  Union's 
satellites.  The  authorities  also  agreed  to  form  joint-stock  compa- 
nies with  the  Soviet  Union.  These  companies  allowed  the  Soviet 
Union  to  dominate  Hungary's  air  and  river  transportation,  as  well 
as  its  bauxite,  crude  oil,  and  refining  industries  and  other  sectors. 

With  the  opposition  parties  disbanded  and  the  trade  unions  col- 
lared, the  churches  became  the  communists'  main  source  of  oppo- 
sition. The  government  had  expropriated  the  churches'  property 
with  the  land  reform,  and  in  July  1948  it  nationalized  church 
schools.  Protestant  church  leaders  reached  a  compromise  with  the 
government,  but  the  head  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church — Car- 
dinal Jozsef  Mindszenty — resisted.  The  government  arrested  him 
in  December  1948  and  sentenced  him  to  life  imprisonment.  Shortly 
thereafter,  the  regime  disbanded  most  Catholic  religious  orders, 
and  it  secularized  Catholic  schools  (see  Religion  and  Religious 
Organizations,  ch.  2). 

Stalin  died  in  March  1953.  The  new  Soviet  leadership  soon  per- 
mitted a  more  flexible  policy  in  Eastern  Europe  known  as  the  New 
Course.  In  June,  Rakosi  and  other  party  leaders — among  them 
Imre  Nagy — were  summoned  to  Moscow,  where  Soviet  leaders 
harshly  criticized  them  for  Hungary's  dismal  economic  perfor- 
mance. Soviet  communist  party  Presidium  member  Lavrenti  Beria 
reportedly  upbraided  Rakosi  for  naming  Jews  to  Hungary's  top 
party  positions  and  accused  him  of  seeking  to  make  himself  the 
"Jewish  King  of  Hungary."  (Communists  of  Jewish  origin  had 
dominated  the  party  leadership  and  the  secret  police  for  a  decade 
after  the  war,  and  every  party  leader  from  Bela  Kun  to  Erno  Gero 
had  Jewish  roots.)  Rakosi  retained  his  position  as  party  chief,  but 
the  Soviet  leaders  forced  the  appointment  of  Nagy  as  prime 
minister.  He  quickly  won  the  support  of  the  government  minis- 
tries and  the  intelligentsia.  Nagy  also  ended  the  purges  and  began 
freeing  political  prisoners.  In  his  first  address  to  the  National  As- 
sembly as  prime  minister,  Nagy  attacked  Rakosi  for  his  use  of  ter- 
ror, and  the  speech  was  printed  in  the  party  newspaper. 

Nagy  charted  his  New  Course  for  Hungary's  drifting  economy 
in  a  speech  before  the  Central  Committee,  which  gave  the  plan 
unanimous  approval  (see  Party  Structure,  ch.  4).  Hungary  ceased 
collectivization  of  agriculture,  allowed  peasants  to  leave  the  col- 
lective farms,  canceled  the  collective  farms'  compulsory  production 


51 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

quotas,  and  raised  government  prices  for  deliveries.  Government 
financial  support  and  guarantees  were  extended  to  private 
producers,  investment  in  the  farm  sector  jumped  20  percent  in  the 
1953-54  period,  and  peasants  were  able  to  increase  the  size  of  their 
private  plots.  The  number  of  peasants  on  collective  farms  thus 
shrank  by  half  between  October  and  December  1953.  Nagy  also 
slashed  investment  in  heavy  industry  by  41.1  percent  in  1953-54 
and  shifted  resources  to  light  industry  and  the  production  of  con- 
sumer goods.  However,  Nagy  failed  to  fundamentally  alter  the  plan- 
ning system  and  neglected  to  introduce  incentives  to  replace 
compulsory  plan  targets,  resulting  in  a  poorer  record  of  plan  ful- 
fillment after  1953  than  before.  Rakosi  used  his  influence  to  dis- 
rupt Nagy's  reforms  and  erode  his  political  position.  In  1954  Soviet 
leaders  who  favored  economic  policies  akin  to  Nagy's  lost  a  Kremlin 
power  struggle.  Rakosi  seized  the  opportunity  to  attack  Nagy  as 
a  right-wing  deviationist  and  to  criticize  shortcomings  in  the  econ- 
omy. Nagy  was  forced  to  resign  from  the  government  in  April  1955 
and  was  later  expelled  from  the  Politburo,  Central  Committee,  and 
finally  the  party  itself.  Thus,  the  Central  Committee  that  had  lauded 
the  New  Course  in  June  1953  unanimously  condemned  its  architect 
less  than  two  years  later. 

After  Nagy's  fall,  collectivization  and  development  of  heavy  in- 
dustry again  became  the  prime  focus  of  Hungary's  economy.  The 
purges  did  not  resume,  however,  as  Rakosi  did  not  enjoy  the  same 
amount  of  power  or  Soviet  support  that  he  did  while  Stalin  was 
alive.  Moreover,  he  now  had  to  contend  with  many  outspoken  op- 
ponents within  the  party,  including  numerous  victims  of  the  purges 
who  had  been  readmitted  to  the  HWP  on  Moscow's  orders.  A 
schism  soon  split  the  party  leadership  from  the  rank  and  file,  and 
the  party  organization  within  the  Writers'  Association  became  a 
forum  for  intraparty  opposition.  In  1955  a  rapprochement  between 
the  Soviet  Union  and  Yugoslavia  produced  the  Belgrade  Declara- 
tion, in  which  Moscow  confirmed  that  each  nation  had  the  right 
to  follow  its  own  road  to  socialism.  One  year  later,  Soviet  leader 
Nikita  S.  Khrushchev  denounced  Stalin  in  his  "secret  speech"  be- 
fore the  Twentieth  Party  Congress  of  the  Soviet  communist  party. 
These  external  events  shook  Rakosi,  who  was  a  strong  opponent 
of  Titoism  and  the  instigator  of  Hungary's  purges. 

HWP  members  opposed  to  Rakosi  compelled  him  to  admit  that 
the  purges  involved  abuse  of  power  and  that  Rajk  and  others  had 
been  its  innocent  victims.  Rakosi  ordered  an  investigation,  but  it 
cleared  him  and  blamed  the  state  security  police  instead.  This  result 
not  only  inflamed  the  party  opposition  but  also  alienated  Rakosi 
from  the  police.  In  June  1956,  Rakosi 's  position  became  untenable. 


52 


Historical  Setting 


The  party  press  printed  open  attacks.  The  Writers'  Association, 
the  newly  created  Petofi  Circle  (see  Glossary),  and  student  organi- 
zations clamored  for  Rakosi's  ouster  and  arrest.  On  June  30,  the 
Central  Committee  dissolved  the  Petofi  Circle  and  expelled  intellec- 
tuals from  the  party.  By  mid-July,  however,  Soviet  leaders  began 
to  fear  outright  revolution  and  called  for  Rakosi  to  step  down.  He 
resigned  after  a  meeting  of  the  Central  Committee  on  July  17.  Gero, 
Rakosi's  deputy,  was  appointed  first  secretary.  Moscow  hoped  to 
introduce  a  slow  liberalization,  but  Gero  was  too  closely  identified 
with  Rakosi,  and  party  discipline  subsequently  broke  down  com- 
pletely. 

Revolution  of  1956 

On  October  23,  a  Budapest  student  rally  in  support  of  Polish 
efforts  to  win  autonomy  from  the  Soviet  Union  sparked  mass 
demonstrations.  The  police  attacked,  and  the  demonstrators  fought 
back,  tearing  down  symbols  of  Soviet  domination  and  HWP  rule, 
sacking  the  party  newspaper's  offices  and  shouting  in  favor  of  free 
elections,  national  independence,  and  the  return  of  Imre  Nagy  to 
power.  Gero  called  out  the  army,  but  many  soldiers  handed  their 
weapons  to  the  demonstrators  and  joined  the  uprising  (see  Histor- 
ical Background  and  Traditions,  ch.  5).  Soviet  officials  in  Budapest 
summoned  Nagy  to  speak  to  the  crowd,  but  the  violence  continued. 
At  Gero's  request,  Soviet  troops  entered  Budapest  on  October  24. 
The  presence  of  these  troops  further  enraged  the  Hungarians,  who 
battled  the  troops  and  state  security  police.  Crowds  emptied  the 
prisons,  freed  Cardinal  Mindszenty,  sacked  police  stations,  and 
summarily  hanged  some  members  of  the  secret  police.  The  Cen- 
tral Committee  named  Nagy  prime  minister  on  October  25  and 
selected  a  new  Politburo  and  Secretariat;  one  day  later,  Janos  Kadar 
replaced  Gero  as  party  first  secretary. 

Nagy  enjoyed  vast  support.  He  formed  a  new  government  con- 
sisting of  both  communists  and  noncommunists,  dissolved  the  state 
security  police,  abolished  the  one-party  system,  and  promised  free 
elections  and  an  end  to  collectivization,  all  with  Kadar' s  support. 
But  Nagy  failed  to  harness  the  popular  revolt.  Workers'  councils 
threatened  a  general  strike  to  back  demands  for  removal  of  Soviet 
troops,  elimination  of  party  interference  in  economic  affairs,  and 
renegotiation  of  economic  treaties  with  the  Soviet  Union.  On  Oc- 
tober 30,  Nagy  called  for  the  formation  of  a  new  democratic,  multi- 
party system.  Noncommunist  parties  that  had  been  suppressed 
almost  a  decade  before  began  to  reorganize.  A  coalition  govern- 
ment emerged  that  included  members  of  the  Smallholders'  Party, 
Social  Democratic  Party,  National  Peasant  Party,  and  other  parties, 


53 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

as  well  as  the  HWP.  After  negotiations,  Soviet  officials  agreed  to 
remove  their  troops  at  the  discretion  of  the  Hungarian  government, 
and  Soviet  troops  began  to  leave  Budapest.  Nagy  soon  learned, 
however,  that  new  Soviet  armored  divisions  had  crossed  into 
Hungary. 

In  response,  on  November  1  Nagy  announced  Hungary's  deci- 
sion to  withdraw  from  the  Warsaw  Pact  (see  Glossary)  and  to  declare 
Hungary  neutral.  He  then  appealed  to  the  United  Nations  and 
Western  governments  for  protection  of  Hungary's  neutrality.  The 
Western  powers,  which  were  involved  in  the  Suez  crisis  and  were 
without  contingency  plans  to  deal  with  a  revolution  in  Eastern 
Europe,  did  not  respond. 

The  Soviet  military  reacted  to  Hungarian  events  with  a  quick 
strike.  On  November  3,  Soviet  troops  surrounded  Budapest  and 
closed  the  country's  borders.  Overnight  they  entered  the  capital 
and  occupied  the  National  Assembly  building.  Kadar,  who  had 
fled  to  the  Soviet  Union  on  November  2 ,  assembled  a  Temporary 
Revolutionary  Government  of  Hungary  on  Soviet  soil  just  across 
the  Hungarian  border.  On  November  4,  the  formation  of  the  new 
government  was  announced  in  a  radio  broadcast.  Kadar  returned 
to  Budapest  in  a  Soviet  armored  car;  by  then,  Nagy  had  fled  to 
the  Yugoslav  embassy,  Cardinal  Mindszenty  had  taken  refuge  in 
the  United  States  embassy,  Rakosi  was  safely  across  the  Soviet 
border,  and  about  200,000  Hungarians  had  escaped  to  the  West. 

With  Soviet  support,  Kadar  struck  almost  immediately  against 
participants  in  the  revolution.  Over  the  next  five  years,  about  2,000 
individuals  were  executed  and  about  25,000  imprisoned.  Kadar 
also  reneged  on  a  guarantee  of  safe  conduct  granted  to  Nagy,  who 
was  arrested  on  November  23  and  deported  to  Romania.  In  June 
1958,  the  Hungarian  government  announced  that  Nagy  and  other 
government  officials  who  had  played  key  roles  in  the  revolution 
had  been  secretly  tried  and  executed. 

Kadar's  Reforms 

The  Revolution  of  1956  discredited  Hungary's  Stalinist  politi- 
cal and  economic  system  and  sent  a  clear  warning  to  the  leader- 
ship that  popular  tolerance  for  its  policies  had  limits,  and  that  if 
these  limits  were  exceeded,  popular  reaction  could  threaten  com- 
munist control.  In  response,  regime  leaders  decided  to  formulate 
economic  policies  leading  to  an  improvement  of  the  population's 
standard  of  living.  Pragmatism  and  reform  gradually  became  the 
watchwords  in  economic  policy-making,  especially  after  1960,  and 
policymakers  began  relying  on  economists  and  other  specialists 
rather  than  ideologists  in  the  formation  of  economic  policies.  The 


54 


Historical  Setting 


result  was  a  series  of  reforms  that  modified  Hungary  's  rigid,  cen- 
trally planned  economy  and  eventually  introduced  elements  of  a 
free  market,  creating  a  concoction  sometimes  called  "goulash  com- 
munism" (see  Economic  Policy  and  Performance,  1945-85,  ch.  3). 

In  late  1956,  the  party  named  a  committee  of  mostly  reform- 
minded  experts  to  examine  Hungary's  economic  system  and  make 
proposals  for  its  revision.  The  committee's  report  marked  the  first 
step  on  Hungary's  road  to  economic  reform.  Its  proposals  presaged 
many  of  the  changes  implemented  a  decade  later,  including  elimi- 
nation of  administrative  direction  of  the  economy,  introduction  of 
greater  enterprise  autonomy,  cooperation  between  private  and  col- 
lective sectors  in  agriculture,  economic  regulation  using  price  and 
credit  policies,  and  central  planning  focused  only  on  long-term  ob- 
jectives. However,  the  committee's  proposals  were  never  really  im- 
plemented. Some  observers  suggested  that  the  party  had  solidified 
its  power  so  quickly  that  it  no  longer  needed  to  enact  such  drastic 
measures;  others  claimed  that  Soviet  leaders  opposed  such  reform 
until  they  ensured  that  the  party  (on  November  1,  1956,  renamed 
the  Hungarian  Socialist  Workers'  Party — HSWP)  had  consolidated 
its  power  and  demonstrated  a  clear  need  for  a  fundamental  eco- 
nomic change.  During  the  chaos  of  the  revolution,  Hungary's  col- 
lective farms  lost  about  two-thirds  of  their  members.  Many  left  to 
become  private  farmers.  In  July  1957,  Kadar  appeased  hard-liners 
in  Hungary  and  abroad  by  agreeing  to  recollectivize  agriculture, 
and  in  early  1959  the  drive  began  in  earnest.  The  regime  com- 
bined force  and  economic  coercion  with  persuasion  and  incentives 
to  drive  peasants  back  to  the  collective  farms  (see  Agricultural 
Organization,  ch.  3).  The  government  abolished  compulsory 
production  quotas  and  delivery  obligations  and  substituted  volun- 
tary contracts  at  good  prices.  It  also  permitted  profit-sharing 
schemes  and  programs  to  promote  technical  innovation.  The  re- 
gime allowed  peasants  to  retain  sizable  private  plots  and  ample 
livestock  and  to  choose  between  collective  or  cooperative  farms. 
The  farms  also  received  substantial  government  investments.  As 
a  result,  Hungary  became  the  only  country  with  a  centrally  planned 
economy  where  crop  output  increased  as  a  result  of  collectiviza- 
tion. By  1962  more  than  95  percent  of  all  farmland  had  been  col- 
lectivized either  in  the  form  of  state  farms  or  cooperatives.  The 
collectivization  drive  deflected  the  hard-liners'  criticism  of  Kadar 
for  his  advocacy  of  reform,  and  problems  with  the  program's  im- 
plementation, including  excessive  coercion  of  the  peasants,  later 
helped  Kadar  oust  the  hard-line  agriculture  minister. 

By  the  early  1960s,  Hungary  was  ripe  for  a  political  shake-up. 
Khrushchev  had  consolidated  his  position  in  the  Kremlin  and  had 


55 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


begun  a  second  wave  of  de-Stalinization,  thus  leading  Kadar  to 
believe  that  the  Soviet  leadership  would  support  political  changes 
in  Hungary.  Kadar  replaced  Ferenc  Munnich  as  prime  minister 
(who  had  served  in  that  position  since  January  28,  1958),  and  as- 
sumed the  top  government  post,  together  with  the  leadership  of 
the  HSWP.  He  then  dismissed  other  hard-line  officials.  Kadar' s 
consolidation  of  power  led  to  a  more  flexible,  pragmatic  atmosphere 
in  which  persuasion  took  on  greater  importance  than  coercion. 
Kadar  relaxed  government  oppression  and  released  most  of  those 
imprisoned  for  participating  in  the  revolution.  Soon  Hungary  be- 
came the  leader  of  the  reform  movement  within  the  Soviet  alliance 
system.  Kadar  intended  to  provide  the  regime  with  some  legitimacy 
and  political  stability  based  on  solid  economic  performance.  The 
Soviet  Union  demonstrated  its  support  with  its  decision  to  with- 
draw its  advisers  to  the  Hungarian  government. 

Kadar  next  sought  a  modus  vivendi  with  the  population,  sum- 
marizing the  new  policy  with  the  slogan  "He  who  is  not  against 
us  is  with  us."  As  part  of  this  "alliance  policy,"  in  1961  he  de- 
nounced the  practice  of  making  party  membership  a  prerequisite 
for  jobs  demanding  specialization  and  technical  expertise.  Kadar 
sought  to  remove  opportunists  who  had  joined  the  party  solely  for 
the  status  and  economic  benefits  that  membership  conferred. 
Rather,  Kadar  wanted  to  open  the  government  and  economic  enter- 
prises to  talented  people  who  were  prepared  to  cooperate  without 
adhering  to  party  discipline  or  compromising  their  political  beliefs. 

At  the  Eighth  Party  Congress  of  the  HSWP  in  November  1962, 
Kadar  supporters  replaced  Stalinists  and  incompetent  officials  in 
leading  party  positions.  The  congress  also  called  for  higher  party 
recruitment  standards,  for  elimination  of  political  and  class  con- 
siderations in  university  admissions,  and  for  allowing  nonparty 
members  to  compete  for  leading  public  positions.  Although  the  party 
still  had  influential  conservative  members  after  1962,  the  Eighth 
Party  Congress  removed  them  from  the  party's  policy-making  core. 
As  a  result  of  these  changes,  by  1963  Kadar  had  acquired  genuine 
popular  support. 

Plans  for  reforming  the  centrally  planned  economy  steadily  took 
shape  after  the  Eighth  Party  Congress.  Central  Committee  secre- 
tary Rezso  Nyers,  who  supported  a  comprehensive  reform  rather 
than  continued  piecemeal  adjustments  to  the  economic  system,  took 
charge  of  economic  affairs.  The  regime  also  appointed  commit- 
tees to  prepare  reform  proposals.  By  1964  the  government  had  iden- 
tified problems  in  the  economy,  including  excessive  investment, 
decreases  in  output  and  labor  shortages  in  agriculture,  misuse  of 
inputs,  hoarding  of  materials,  and  production  of  unsalable  goods.

Historical  Setting 


Since  the  Treaty  of  Trianon,  Hungary  had  depended  on  foreign 
trade,  and  in  the  early  1960s  the  government  placed  top  priority 
on  improving  trade  with  the  West  and  the  Comecon  countries. 
Despite  improving  the  terms  of  trade,  however,  by  1964  Hungary 
had  accumulated  a  serious  trade  deficit,  and  the  government  could 
not  slow  imports  without  cutting  material  supplies  and  personal 
consumption.  Officials  realized  that  because  Hungary  had  to  boost 
exports,  it  would  have  to  meet  the  needs,  quality  standards,  and 
technological  requirements  of  the  world  economy. 

New  Economic  Mechanism 

Khrushchev's  ouster  in  October  1964  failed  to  weaken  Hungary's 
desire  for  reform.  Kadar  responded  to  the  change  in  the  Kremlin 
by  affirming  that  "the  political  attitude  of  the  HSWP  and  the 
government  of  the  Hungarian  People's  Republic  has  not  changed 
one  iota,  nor  will  it  change."  In  December  1964,  a  Central  Com- 
mittee plenum  approved  the  basic  concept  of  economic  reform  and 
formed  a  committee  to  provide  fundamental  guidelines. 

Economic  problems  also  continued  to  underscore  the  need  for 
reform.  Agricultural  output  fell  by  5.5  percent.  In  addition,  the 
government  increased  production  quotas,  cut  wages,  and  an- 
nounced price  hikes.  Popular  discontent  rose  as  a  result. 

In  May  1966,  the  Central  Committee  approved  a  sweeping  re- 
form package  known  as  the  New  Economic  Mechanism  (NEM). 
Although  many  of  its  elements  could  be  phased  in  during  a  prepa- 
ration period,  the  central  features  of  the  reform  could  be  imple- 
mented only  with  the  introduction  of  a  new  price  system,  which 
was  set  for  January  1,  1968.  With  the  NEM,  the  government  sought 
to  overcome  the  inefficiencies  of  central  planning,  to  motivate 
talented  and  skilled  people  to  work  harder  and  produce  more,  to 
make  Hungary's  products  competitive  in  foreign  markets,  espe- 
cially in  the  West,  and,  above  all,  to  create  the  prosperity  that  would 
ensure  political  stability. 

The  NEM  decentralized  decision  making  and  made  profit,  rather 
than  plan  fulfillment,  the  enterprises'  main  goal.  Instead  of  set- 
ting plan  targets  and  allocating  supplies,  the  government  was  to 
influence  enterprise  activity  only  through  indirect  financial,  fiscal, 
and  price  instruments  known  as  "economic  regulators."  The  NEM 
introduced  a  profit  tax  and  allowed  enterprises  to  make  their  own 
decisions  concerning  output,  marketing,  and  sales.  Subsidies  were 
eliminated  for  most  goods  except  basic  raw  materials.  The  govern- 
ment decentralized  allocation  of  capital  and  supply  and  partially 
decentralized  foreign  trade  and  investment  decision  making.  The 
economy's  focus  moved  away  from  heavy  industry  to  light  industry 


57

and  modernization  of  the  infrastructure.  Finally,  agricultural  col- 
lectives gained  the  freedom  to  make  investment  decisions.  The 
NEM's  initial  results  were  positive.  In  the  1968-70  period,  plan 
fulfillment  was  more  successful  than  in  previous  years.  The  stan- 
dard of  living  rose  as  production  and  trade  increased.  Product  vari- 
ety broadened,  sales  increased  faster  than  production,  inventory 
backlogs  declined,  and  the  trade  balance  with  both  East  and  West 
improved.  In  practice,  however,  the  reform  was  not  as  sweeping 
as  planned.  Enterprises  continued  to  bargain  with  government 
authorities  for  resources  from  central  funds  and  sought  preferen- 
tial treatment.  The  reform  also  failed  to  dismantle  the  highly  con- 
centrated industrial  structure,  which  was  originally  established  to 
facilitate  central  planning  and  which  inhibited  competition  under 
the  NEM. 

The  Kadar  regime  failed  to  understand  that  real  economic  de- 
centralization required  political  reform  to  resolve  conflicts  that 
naturally  arose  between  different  interest  groups.  The  government's 
problem  was  to  expand  "socialist  democracy,"  that  is,  to  build 
a  system  that  would  simultaneously  resolve  conflicts  and  maintain 
the  HSWP's  political  monopoly.  In  fact,  the  government  attempted 
some  incremental  changes.  The  courts  gained  greater  independence 
in  administering  justice,  and  changes  were  introduced  in  parlia- 
ment as  deputies  on  committees  of  the  National  Assembly  were 
instructed  to  examine  and  debate  legislation  more  effectively.  A 
1966  electoral  law  created  single-representative  constituencies  and 
contained  a  provision  for  elections  with  multiple  candidates. 
However,  the  Patriotic  People's  Front  (PPF)  retained  control  of 
nominations  (see  Patriotic  People's  Front,  ch.  4).  Even  after  a  sec- 
ond electoral  law  in  1970  made  it  legal  for  other  groups  to  nominate 
individuals,  few  multiple  candidacies  actually  arose  (see  Elections 
to  the  National  Assembly,  ch.  4).  These  minimal  changes  quickly 
encountered  resistance  from  entrenched  party  officials.  The  1968 
Soviet  invasion  of  Czechoslovakia  and  suppression  of  the  reform 
program  there  had  also  discouraged  the  HS WP  from  pursuing  fur- 
ther political  changes.  However,  Kadar  was  able  to  work  out  a 
modus  vivendi  with  the  Soviet  leadership.  The  Soviet  Union  al- 
lowed Kadar  leeway  to  implement  economic  reforms,  develop  some 
economic  contacts  with  the  West,  and  permit  Hungarians  to  travel 
abroad  as  long  as  Budapest  accepted  Moscow's  hegemony  in 
Eastern  Europe  and  adhered  to  Soviet  foreign  policy  positions. 

The  Kadar  regime  gave  serious  attention  to  implementing  the 
NEM  from  1968  to  1972.  In  1971,  however,  counterreform  forces 
were  gathering  strength  and  calling  for  the  return  of  central  con- 
trols. The  opposition  arose  from  government  and  party  bureaucrats 


58 


Historical  Setting 


and  was  supported  by  large  enterprises  and  some  workers.  The 
bureaucrats  perceived  the  NEM  as  a  threat  to  their  privileged  po- 
sitions. The  large  enterprises  saw  their  income  drop  after  the  in- 
troduction of  the  NEM  and  were  troubled  by  competition  for 
materials  and  labor  from  smaller  enterprises.  Disaffected  workers 
who  were  on  the  payrolls  of  outdated,  inefficient  industries  resented 
the  higher  incomes  earned  by  workers  in  more  modern  firms.  This 
opposition  successfully  reversed  the  reform  a  few  months  after 
Moscow  expressed  reservations  about  the  NEM  and  concern  about 
"petit  bourgeois  tendencies"  in  Hungary. 

In  November  1972,  the  Central  Committee  introduced  a  pack- 
age of  extraordinary  measures  to  recentralize  part  of  the  economy, 
but  the  regime  did  not  formally  abandon  the  NEM .  Fifty  large  en- 
terprises, which  produced  about  50  percent  of  Hungary's  indus- 
trial output  and  60  percent  of  its  exports,  came  under  direct 
ministerial  supervision,  supported  by  special  subsidies.  New  re- 
strictions applied  to  small  enterprises  and  agricultural  producers. 
Wages  rose,  prices  came  under  central  control,  and  the  regime  in- 
troduced price  supports.  In  the  following  years,  the  government 
also  merged  many  profitable  small  firms  with  large  enterprises. 

The  1973  world  oil  crisis  and  the  subsequent  recession  in  the 
West  caused  a  drastic  deterioration  of  Hungary's  terms  of  trade 
and  strengthened  opposition  to  the  reform.  Inflation  threatened, 
and  counterreformers  argued  for  protecting  the  living  standard  of 
the  working  class  from  an  economic  shock  in  the  capitalist  world. 
The  government  intervened  by  raising  taxes  on  successful  firms 
and  increasing  government  purchases  and  subsidies.  Consumer 
prices  eventually  fell  below  the  level  of  producer  prices,  and  Hun- 
gary accepted  credits  from  Western  banks.  Centralized  material 
allocation  was  reintroduced.  After  the  oil  crisis  arose,  ideological 
opposition  to  the  NEM  and  to  "bourgeois  attitudes"  emerged  as 
well.  A  clampdown  on  intellectuals  began,  and  Nyers  lost  his  Polit- 
buro position  in  1974. 

By  1978  Hungary's  dismal  economic  performance  made  it  clear 
even  to  the  counterreformers  in  the  leadership  that  a  "reform  of 
the  reform"  was  necessary.  Return  to  central  control  had  only  re- 
warded inefficiency  and  stifled  innovation  and  initiative.  Enter- 
prises ignored  market  signals,  and  shortages  plagued  producers. 
Large  amounts  of  money  were  invested  in  poorly  conceived  projects, 
and  a  trade  deficit  accumulated.  Hungary's  hard-currency  debt 
reached  US$7.5  billion  by  1978  and  had  jumped  to  US$9.1  bil- 
lion by  1980. 

In  1978  the  government  admitted  that  its  attempt  to  shield  Hun- 
gary from  world  economic  conditions  could  not  be  continued.

Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

Hoping  to  improve  its  trade  balance  with  the  West  and  avoid  forced 
rescheduling  of  its  debt,  the  government  announced  its  intention 
to  boost  exports.  This  policy  change  marked  the  beginning  of  a 
new  wave  of  reforms.  First,  the  price  system  was  restructured  to 
bring  consumer  prices  gradually  in  line  with  world  market  prices 
and  to  ease  the  burden  of  subsidies  on  the  state  budget.  Next, 
producer  prices  were  reformed  to  bring  about  more  rational  use 
of  energy  and  raw  materials.  Finally,  the  government  overhauled 
exchange-rate  and  foreign-trade  regulations. 

In  1979  and  1980,  the  government  implemented  a  number  of 
institutional  reforms.  The  new  reforms  abolished  branch  minis- 
tries and  replaced  them  with  a  single  Ministry  of  Industry  intended 
to  act  as  a  policy-formulating  body  without  direct  authority  over 
enterprises.  Large  enterprises  were  broken  up  into  smaller  firms. 
In  1982  the  government  legalized  the  formation  of  small  private 
firms,  including  restaurants,  small  shops,  and  service  companies, 
and  it  permitted  workers  to  lease  enterprise  equipment,  use  it  on 
their  own  time,  and  keep  the  earnings  from  their  products.  In  1984 
the  regime  introduced  new  forms  of  enterprise  management,  in- 
cluding supervisory  councils  that  would  include  worker-elected 
representatives.  New  financial  institutions  also  emerged,  and  a  1983 
government  decree  allowed  enterprises,  cooperatives,  financial  in- 
stitutions, and  local  governments  to  issue  bonds. 

In  the  early  and  mid-1980s,  Kadar  had  encouraged  a  limited 
amount  of  political  liberalization.  The  HSWP  maintained  its  mo- 
nopoly on  political  power,  but  the  norms  of  democratic  centralism 
were  looser  than  in  other  countries  of  Eastern  Europe  (see 
Democratic  Centralism,  ch.  4).  County  party  secretaries  acquired 
the  freedom  to  make  decisions  of  local  importance,  including  con- 
trol of  personnel.  The  government  again  exhorted  delegates  of  the 
National  Assembly  to  scrutinize  laws  and  government  policies  more 
critically.  In  1983  a  new  electoral  law  required  a  minimum  of  two 
candidates  for  each  national  and  local  constituency  in  general  elec- 
tions. Trade  unions  began  to  defend  workers'  interests  more  ener- 
getically. Journalists  were  urged  to  expose  low-  and  mid-level 
corruption  and  abuse  of  power,  although  they  could  not  criticize 
the  regime's  basic  tenets.  The  leadership  also  bolstered  economic 
reforms  of  the  early  1980s  with  a  foreign  policy  geared  to  a  greater 
degree  than  before  on  trade  with  the  West,  and  it  maintained 
this  course  during  the  deterioration  of  superpower  relations  in  the 
early  1980s.  Thus,  the  economic  reforms  of  the  late  1960s  had  also 
come  to  provoke  a  measure  of  political  reform  and  changes  in  for- 
eign policy.  These  new  departures  were  inspired  in  large  measure 
by  Hungarian  nationalism,  a  force  that  had  long  encouraged

Chapter  2.  The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


A  peasant  girl,  Esztergom,  1918 


THE  PEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC  OF  HUNGARY  lies  in  the  cen- 
tral Danube  Basin.  With  92,103  square  kilometers  of  territory,  it 
is  the  sixteenth  largest  European  country.  The  country's  terrain 
consists  largely  of  plains  and  hill  country  and  is  divided  into  three 
major  geographic  areas:  the  Great  Plain,  covering  the  central  part 
of  the  country,  the  Transdanube  in  the  west,  and  the  Northern 
Hills  along  the  northern  border.  The  climate  is  mild  and  continen- 
tal, although  great  contrasts  in  temperatures  can  occur. 

In  1988  the  country  had  about  10.6  million  inhabitants.  Popu- 
lation had  grown  slowly  since  the  late  1970s  and  had  begun  to 
decline  in  1981.  In  1986  about  19.2  percent  of  the  population  lived 
in  Budapest,  the  country's  cultural,  political,  and  economic  center. 
Beginning  in  1978,  for  the  first  time  in  the  country's  history,  more 
people  lived  in  urban  centers  than  in  rural  areas.  By  1988  about 
62  percent  of  the  populace  lived  in  urban  centers  with  populations 
exceeding  10,000. 

In  the  late  1980s,  more  than  96  percent  of  the  people  were  eth- 
nic Magyars.  The  minority,  or  non-Magyar,  population  was  small 
and  included  Germans,  Slovaks,  Serbs,  Croats,  Slovenes,  Roma- 
nians, Jews,  Gypsies,  and  Greeks.  Most  non-Magyars  were  bilin- 
gual, speaking  both  their  own  language  and  Hungarian. 

The  combined  impact  of  World  War  II  and  the  communist 
takeover  in  1947  brought  about  great  changes  in  the  social  struc- 
ture. For  more  than  a  decade,  the  new  communist  government 
sought  to  create  a  classless  society  through  various  forms  of  social 
engineering.  Beginning  in  the  1960s,  these  efforts  gave  way  to  more 
indirect  methods  of  social  and  economic  control.  The  pace  of  change 
slowed,  and  a  social  structure  took  shape  that  once  again  contained 
clearly  stratified  groups.  In  its  new  form,  society  did  not  display 
the  extremes  of  wealth  and  poverty  characteristic  of  the  interwar 
period.  However,  as  the  country's  economic  difficulties  increased 
in  the  1980s,  tensions  appeared  to  build  between  the  wealthy  elites 
and  the  sizable  disadvantaged  groups  in  society.  Public  discussion 
acknowledged  these  growing  tensions  and  debated  methods  for  over- 
coming them. 

The  family  remained  the  basic  social  unit.  The  state  recognized 
marriage  as  a  secular  institution  and  held  the  stability  of  families 
to  be  a  desirable  social  goal.  However,  observers  in  the  1980s  iden- 
tified a  number  of  sources  of  family  stress  that  appeared  to  con- 
tribute to  a  high  rate  of  divorce.

Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

After  the  communist  assumption  of  power  in  the  late  1940s,  sev- 
eral mass  organizations — official  trade  unions,  the  National  Council 
of  Hungarian  Women,  and  the  Communist  Youth  League — were 
established  to  interpret  for  various  segments  of  the  population  the 
social  and  political  goals  of  the  Hungarian  Socialist  Workers'  Party, 
to  mobilize  support  for  it,  and  to  serve  as  centers  of  a  collective 
social  life.  But  in  the  late  1980s,  these  organizations  were  losing 
members,  and  they  faced  growing  competition  from  new  unoffi- 
cial groups  that  emerged  in  the  relaxed  political  atmosphere. 

According  to  Western  estimates,  in  the  late  1980s  about  67.5 
percent  of  the  population  was  Roman  Catholic,  20  percent  was 
Reformed  (Calvinist),  5  percent  was  Lutheran,  and  5  percent  was 
unaffiliated.  The  country  also  contained  smaller  groups  of  Uniates 
(Catholics  of  the  Eastern  Rite),  Greek  Orthodox,  various  small 
Protestant  sects,  and  Jews.  In  1989  the  government  abolished 
the  State  Office  for  Church  Affairs,  which  had  supervised  the 
churches.  A  proposal  for  new  law  submitted  for  public  discussion 
in  1989  was  intended  to  eliminate  almost  all  restrictions  on  the 
churches. 

The  country's  education  system  provided  free,  compulsory 
schooling  for  young  people  from  six  to  sixteen  years  of  age.  About 
half  of  all  students  attended  general  schools  (also  known  as  ele- 
mentary schools)  for  eight  years  and  then  completed  their  educa- 
tion through  vocational  training.  The  remainder  continued  their 
studies  in  a  four-year  gymnasium  (a  secondary  school  for  univer- 
sity preparation)  or  trade  school.  The  general  schools'  curriculum 
stressed  technical  and  vocational  training.  In  the  1980s,  almost  10 
percent  of  the  population  aged  eighteen  to  twenty-two  was  en- 
rolled in  regular  daytime  courses  of  study  at  institutions  of  higher 
learning. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  state  health  care  and  pension  systems  were 
highly  centralized.  Medical  care  was  free  to  all  citizens.  However, 
many  physicians  maintained  private  practices,  and  people  who 
could  afford  to  receive  care  on  a  private  basis  often  preferred  to 
do  so.  Availability  of  medical  personnel  and  hospital  beds  was  high 
by  international  standards.  The  country's  pension  system,  although 
extensive,  was  the  object  of  considerable  criticism  in  the  1980s  be- 
cause of  the  low  levels  of  support  provided  to  many  retirees. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  bounds  of  permissible  expression  in  Hun- 
gary suddenly  had  become  wide  by  East  European  standards. 
Authorities  had  lifted  most  traditional  prohibitions.  Opposition 
groups  were  able  to  function  legally.  Consequently,  the  country 
experienced  a  quickening  and  enlivening  of  cultural  and  intellec- 
tual life.

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 

Physical  Environment 

With  a  land  area  of  92, 103  square  kilometers,  Hungary  is  roughly 
the  size  of  the  state  of  Indiana.  It  measures  about  250  kilometers 
from  north  to  south  and  524  kilometers  from  east  to  west.  It  has 
some  2,258  kilometers  of  boundaries,  shared  with  Austria  to  the 
west,  Yugoslavia  to  the  south  and  southwest,  Romania  to  the 
southeast,  the  Soviet  Union  to  the  northeast,  and  Czechoslovakia 
to  the  north. 

Hungary's  modern  borders  were  first  established  after  World 
War  I  when,  by  the  terms  of  the  Treaty  of  Trianon  in  1920,  it 
lost  more  than  two-thirds  of  what  had  formerly  been  the  Kingdom 
of  Hungary  and  58.5  percent  of  its  population  (see  Trianon  Hun- 
gary, ch.  1).  With  the  aid  of  Nazi  Germany,  the  country  secured 
some  boundary  revisions  at  the  expense  of  parts  of  Slovakia  in  1938 
and  Carpatho-Ukraine  in  1939  and  at  the  expense  of  Romania  in 
1940.  However,  Hungary  lost  these  territories  again  with  its  defeat 
in  World  War  II.  After  World  War  II,  the  Trianon  boundaries 
were  restored  with  a  small  revision  that  benefited  Czechoslovakia. 

Topography 

Most  of  the  country  has  an  elevation  of  fewer  than  200  meters 
(see  fig.  6).  Although  Hungary  has  several  moderately  high  ranges 
of  mountains,  those  reaching  heights  of  300  meters  or  more  cover 
less  than  2  percent  of  the  country.  The  highest  point  in  the  coun- 
try is  Mount  Kekes  (1,008  meters)  in  the  Matra  Mountains  north- 
east of  Budapest.  The  lowest  spot  is  77.6  meters  above  sea  level, 
located  in  the  Hortobagy. 

The  major  rivers  in  the  country  are  the  Danube  and  Tisza.  About 
one- third  of  the  total  length  of  the  Danube  River  lies  in  Hungary; 
the  river  also  flows  through  parts  of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Ger- 
many (West  Germany),  Austria,  Czechoslovakia,  Yugoslavia,  and 
Romania.  It  is  navigable  within  Hungary  for  418  kilometers.  The 
Tisza  River  is  navigable  for  444  kilometers  in  the  country.  Less 
important  rivers  include  the  Drava  along  the  Yugoslav  border,  the 
Raba,  the  Azamos,  the  Sio,  and  the  Ipoly  along  the  Czechoslovak 
border.  Hungary  has  three  major  lakes.  Lake  Balaton,  the  largest, 
is  78  kilometers  long  and  from  3  to  14  kilometers  wide,  with  an 
area  of  592  square  kilometers.  Hungarians  often  refer  to  it  as  the 
Hungarian  Sea.  It  is  Central  Europe's  largest  freshwater  lake  and 
an  important  recreation  area.  Its  shallow  waters  offer  good  sum- 
mer swimming,  and  in  winter  its  frozen  surface  provides  excellent 
opportunities  for  winter  sports.  Smaller  bodies  of  water  are  Lake

Velence  (26  square  kilometers)  in  Feher  County  and  Lake  Ferto 
(Neusiedlersee — about  82  square  kilometers  within  Hungary). 

Hungary  has  three  major  geographic  regions:  the  Great  Plain 
(Nagy  Alfold),  lying  east  of  the  Danube  River;  the  Transdanube, 
a  hilly  region  lying  west  of  the  Danube  and  extending  to  the  foothills 
of  the  Austrian  Alps;  and  the  Northern  Hills,  which  is  a  moun- 
tainous and  hilly  country  beyond  the  northern  boundary  of  the 
Great  Plain. 

The  Great  Plain  contains  the  basin  of  the  Tisza  River  and  its 
branches.  It  encompasses  more  than  half  of  the  country's  territory. 
Bordered  by  mountains  on  all  sides,  it  has  a  variety  of  terrains, 
including  regions  of  fertile  soil,  sandy  areas,  wastelands,  and 
swampy  areas.  Hungarians  have  inhabited  the  Great  Plain  for  at 
least  a  millennium.  Here  is  found  the  puszta,  long  an  unculti- 
vated expanse  (the  most  famous  such  area  still  in  existence  is  the 
Hortobagy),  with  which  much  Hungarian  folklore  is  associated. 
In  earlier  centuries,  the  Great  Plain  was  unsuitable  for  farming 
because  of  frequent  flooding.  Instead,  it  was  the  home  of  massive 
herds  of  cattle  and  horses.  In  the  last  half  of  the  nineteenth  cen- 
tury, the  government  sponsored  programs  to  control  the  riverways 
and  expedite  inland  drainage  in  the  Great  Plain.  With  the  danger 
of  recurrent  flooding  largely  eliminated,  much  of  the  land  was  placed 
under  cultivation,  and  herding  ceased  to  be  a  major  contributor 
to  the  area's  economy. 

The  Transdanube  region  lies  in  the  western  part  of  the  coun- 
try, bounded  by  the  Danube  River,  the  Drava  River,  and  the  re- 
mainder of  the  country's  border  with  Yugoslavia.  It  lies  south  and 
west  of  the  course  of  the  Danube.  It  contains  Lake  Ferto  and  Lake 
Balaton.  The  region  consists  mostly  of  rolling  foothills  of  the  Aus- 
trian Alps.  However,  several  areas  of  the  Transdanube  are  flat, 
most  notably  the  Little  Plain  (Kis  Alfold)  along  the  lower  course 
of  the  Raba  River.  The  Transdanube  is  primarily  an  agricultural 
area,  with  flourishing  crops,  livestock,  and  viticulture.  Mineral 
deposits  and  oil  are  found  in  Zala  County  close  to  the  border  of 
Yugoslavia. 

The  Northern  Hills  lie  north  of  Budapest  and  run  in  a  north- 
easterly direction  south  of  the  border  with  Czechoslovakia.  The 
higher  ridges,  which  are  mostly  forested,  have  rich  coal  and  iron 
deposits.  Minerals  are  a  major  resource  of  the  area  and  have  long 
been  the  basis  of  the  industrial  economies  of  cities  in  the  region. 
Viticulture  is  also  important,  producing  the  famous  Tokay  wine. 

The  country's  best  natural  resource  is  fertile  land,  although  soil 
quality  varies  greatly.  About  70  percent  of  the  country's  total  ter- 
ritory is  suitable  for  agriculture;  of  this  portion,  72  percent  is  arable

land.  Hungary  lacks  extensive  domestic  sources  of  the  energy  and 
raw  materials  needed  for  industrial  development  (see  Resource 
Base,  ch.  3). 

Climate 

Temperatures  in  Hungary  vary  from  -28°C  to  22°C.  Average 
yearly  rainfall  is  about  sixty-four  centimeters.  Distribution  and  fre- 
quency of  rainfall  are  unpredictable.  The  western  part  of  the  country 
usually  receives  more  rain  than  the  eastern  part,  where  severe 
droughts  may  occur  in  summertime.  Weather  conditions  in  the 
Great  Plain  can  be  especially  harsh,  with  hot  summers,  cold  winters, 
and  scant  rainfall. 

By  the  1980s,  the  countryside  was  beginning  to  show  the  effects 
of  pollution,  both  from  pesticides  used  in  agriculture  and  from  in- 
dustrial pollutants.  Most  noticeable  was  the  gradual  contamina- 
tion of  the  country's  bodies  of  water,  endangering  fish  and  wildlife. 
Although  concern  was  mounting  over  these  disturbing  threats  to 
the  environment,  no  major  steps  had  yet  been  taken  to  arrest  them 
(see  Environmental  Problems,  ch.  3). 

Population 

Since  World  War  II,  Hungary  has  exhibited  several  population 
trends  that  parallel  those  in  other  advanced  societies.  Population 
leveled  off  after  the  war  and  even  began  to  decline.  The  birth  rate 
fell,  and  people  flocked  from  the  countryside  to  the  cities,  espe- 
cially to  the  major  urban  areas. 

Historical  Trends 

Trianon  Hungary  emerged  from  World  War  I  with  reduced 
borders  roughly  coterminous  with  Hungary's  present-day  borders. 
In  1920  Hungary  had  about  8  million  inhabitants,  and  by  1941 
the  population  had  grown  to  approximately  9.3  million  (see  table  2, 
Appendix).  But  the  country  lost  about  5  percent  of  its  population 
in  World  War  II,  so  as  of  1949  the  population  was  only  about  8.8 
million.  Thereafter,  the  growth  rate  of  the  population  fluctuated 
substantially.  Until  the  mid-1950s,  high  fertility  and  declining  mor- 
tality caused  rapid  population  growth.  In  1954  the  highest  post- 
war live-birth  rate  was  reached,  at  23  births  per  1 ,000  population. 
Subsequently,  until  the  mid-1960s  the  birth  rate  declined,  but  the 
mortality  rate  was  also  low.  In  the  late  1960s  and  early  1970s,  the 
birth  rate  again  rose,  partly  because  of  demographic  measures  in- 
troduced by  the  government  in  1967  and  1973  (see  Health  and  Wel- 
fare, this  ch.).  Because  the  overall  population  had  begun  to  age, 


71

Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


the  mortality  rate  also  increased  during  this  period,  but  it  was 
counterbalanced  by  the  higher  rate  of  live  births. 

Structure 

Beginning  in  the  late  1970s,  the  birth  rate  declined  and  mortal- 
ity increased.  By  the  early  1980s,  Hungary's  growth  rate  had  be- 
come one  of  the  lowest  in  the  world.  More  ominously,  beginning 
in  1981,  deaths  outnumbered  births.  Over  the  1980s,  population 
decreased  absolutely  after  peaking  at  a  post- World  War  II  high 
of  10.7  million  in  1980.  Thus,  the  1988  census  reported  that  about 
10.6  million  people  lived  in  the  country. 

In  1986  the  birth  rate  was  12.1  per  1 ,000  population,  up  slighdy 
from  the  postwar  low  of  11.8  per  1,000  in  1984.  However,  as  re- 
cently as  1975  the  birth  rate  had  been  18.4  per  1 ,000,  and  in  1948 
the  birth  rate  had  been  21  per  1,000.  One  major  reason  for  the 
overall  decline  of  the  birth  rate  appeared  to  be  the  increasing  num- 
ber of  highly  educated  and  economically  active  women  who,  as  in 
other  countries,  tended  to  have  fewer  children.  Age  appeared  to 
play  no  role  in  the  declining  birth  rate.  In  1986  women  married 
at  an  average  age  of  24.6  years,  a  figure  only  slightly  higher  than 
in  1948,  when  the  average  age  was  24.5.  In  the  1980s,  the  typical 
family  had  only  two  children  (reflecting  a  dramatic  decrease  from 
the  final  decades  of  the  nineteenth  century,  when  the  average  num- 
ber of  children  per  family  had  been  five). 

Overall,  the  population  of  the  country  was  aging.  A  growing 
proportion  of  the  population  was  aged  fifty-five  or  older,  increas- 
ing from  19.6  percent  of  the  population  in  1960  to  24.5  percent 
in  1988.  By  contrast,  in  1988  the  proportion  of  the  population  under 
fifteen  was  about  21  percent,  which  reflected  a  decrease  of  about 
4  percent  since  1949  and  resulted  from  the  declining  birth  rate. 

Marriage  rates  fell  steadily  from  the  mid-1970s  to  the  mid-1980s 
(see  table  3,  Appendix).  In  1975  the  marriage  rate  was  9.9  per 
1,000.  By  1986  that  number  had  declined  to  6.8  per  1,000. 
Moreover,  in  1980  for  the  first  time,  the  number  of  marriages  that 
ended  because  of  death  or  divorce  outnumbered  the  number  of  mar- 
riages that  took  place.  In  1980  the  number  of  "marriages  ceased" 
because  of  death  and  divorce  was  9.2  per  1,000  population.  That 
number  rose  to  9.3  by  1983,  then  fell  slighdy  back  to  9.2  by  1986. 

Death  rates  were  relatively  high,  and  they  were  rising.  In  1986 
the  death  rate  was  13.8  per  1,000,  as  compared  with  12.4  per  1,000 
in  1975.  In  1986  life  expectancy  averaged  sixty-eight  years,  up  from 
about  sixty- six  years  in  1975.  For  women  in  1986,  the  average  life 
span  was  almost  seventy-two  years;  for  men,  it  was  just  under  sixty- 
five  years.

Settlement  Patterns 

In  1945  only  35  percent  of  the  population  lived  in  urban  areas. 
After  1945  much  of  the  population  moved  from  the  country's  less 
developed  counties  to  Budapest  and  later  to  its  suburbs  and  to  the 
industrial  counties  of  Hajdu-Bihar  and  Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen.  The 
number  of  urban  dwellers  grew  by  more  than  50  percent  from  1949 
to  1984.  In  1978,  for  the  first  time  in  the  country's  history,  more 
people  lived  in  urban  centers  than  in  rural  areas.  In  1949  the  popu- 
lation density  was  about  100  persons  per  square  kilometer.  By  the 
1980s,  that  figure  had  climbed  to  about  117  persons  per  square 
kilometer. 

In  the  late  1980s,  nine  cities  had  populations  greater  than 
100,000.  Budapest,  the  country's  focal  point  for  government,  cul- 
ture, industry,  trade,  and  transport,  was  by  far  the  largest  city, 
with  2.1  million  inhabitants,  or  19.2  percent  of  the  country's  popu- 
lation. Other  major  population  centers  were  Debrecen,  with  217,000 
inhabitants;  Miskolc,  with  210,000;  Szeged,  with  188,000;  Pecs, 
with  182,000;  Gyor,  with  131,000;  Nyiregyhaza,  with  119,000; 
Szekesfehervar,  with  113,000;  and  Kecskemet,  with  105,000.  In 
1988  the  country  had  a  total  of  143  urban  centers  with  more  than 


73 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


10,000  inhabitants,  where  about  62  percent  of  the  population 
lived. 

As  of  1988,  the  country  had  2,915  settlements  with  fewer  than 
10,000  inhabitants,  where  38  percent  of  the  people  made  their 
homes.  Beginning  in  the  1950s,  the  smallest  villages,  or  those  with 
fewer  than  5,000  inhabitants,  tended  to  lose  their  residents. 
However,  the  number  of  people  leaving  the  villages  decreased  every 
year  after  1960.  Whereas  in  1960  about  259,000  people  left  the 
villages  permanently,  that  number  declined  to  about  129,000  in 
1986.  The  number  of  people  leaving  the  villages  exceeded  the  num- 
ber coming  to  the  countryside  by  approximately  52,000  people  in 
1960.  That  number  had  declined  to  37,769  in  1980  and  20,814 
in  1986. 

In  the  1980s,  a  substantial  number  of  persons  of  Hungarian  origin 
lived  outside  the  country.  Many  of  these  lived  in  neighboring  coun- 
tries (see  Relations  with  Other  Communist  Neighbors,  ch.  4). 
Others  had  moved  even  farther  from  their  homeland.  In  the  three 
decades  before  World  War  I,  some  3  million  ethnic  Hungarian 
peasants  had  fled  to  the  United  States  to  escape  rural  poverty  (see 
Social  Changes,  ch.  1).  During  and  after  the  Revolution  of  1956, 
about  250,000  people  left  the  country,  traveling  first  to  Austria  and 
Yugoslavia  and  eventually  emigrating  to  Australia,  Britain,  Can- 
ada, France,  Switzerland,  the  United  States,  and  West  Germany. 
In  the  late  1980s,  about  40  percent  of  all  persons  of  Hungarian 
origin  were  living  outside  Hungary. 

The  Hungarian  People 

As  a  result  of  population  transfers  after  World  War  II,  Hun- 
gary became  one  of  the  most  ethnically  homogeneous  countries  in 
Eastern  Europe.  Unlike  most  Europeans,  Hungarians  trace  their 
lineage  to  the  Finno-Ugric  people — an  Asiatic  tribe.  For  this  rea- 
son, Hungarians  have  long  felt  themselves  to  be  distinct  from  the 
other  peoples  who  live  in  their  midst. 

Ethnic  discrimination — except  toward  the  Gypsies — was  almost 
nonexistent  in  Hungary  in  the  1980s.  Particularly  after  the  late 
1960s,  the  government  had  made  great  efforts  to  ensure  fair  and 
equal  treatment  for  minority  nationalities.  Foreign  policy  consider- 
ations partially  explained  this  liberal  policy  toward  minorities.  The 
Romanian  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  the  Czechoslovak  governments 
subjected  Hungarians  in  their  countries  to  many  kinds  of  discrimi- 
nation. To  provide  these  governments  with  incentives  to  relax  their 
pressure  against  Hungarian  minorities,  Budapest  pursued  very  liberal 
policies  toward  its  own  national  minorities  and  sought  to  make  its 
minority  policies  a  model  for  other  countries  in  Eastern  Europe.

Origins  and  Language 

The  Hungarian  people  are  thought  to  have  originated  in  an  an- 
cient Finno-Ugric  population  that  originally  inhabited  the  forested 
area  between  the  Volga  River  and  the  Ural  Mountains.  Sometime 
between  the  first  and  fifth  centuries  A.D. ,  after  the  Ugric  and  Finnic 
peoples  had  split,  Ugric  tribes  in  the  eastern  portion  of  the  terri- 
tory moved  farther  south,  intermingling  with  nomadic  Bulgar- 
Turkish  peoples  (see  Early  History,  ch.  1).  Some  of  these  tribes 
settled  in  the  Carpathian  Basin  in  the  ninth  century  A.D.  and  be- 
came the  direct  ancestors  of  today's  inhabitants  of  Hungary.  The 
proper  name  for  the  largest  ethnic  group  in  Hungary  is  Magyar. 
The  word  is  a  derivative  of  Megyeri,  supposedly  the  name  of  one 
of  the  original  ten  Magyar  tribes.  Magyar  refers  specifically  to  both 
the  language  and  the  ethnic  group.  The  words  Hungary  and  Hun- 
garian are  derivatives  of  a  Slavicized  form  of  the  Turkic  words  on 
ogur,  meaning  "ten  arrows,"  which  may  have  referred  to  the  num- 
ber of  Magyar  tribes. 

Hungarian  is  the  country's  only  official  language.  It  is  a  mem- 
ber of  the  Finno-Ugric  family  of  languages,  unrelated  to  the  Indo- 
European  language  family,  which  contains  the  major  European 


75

languages.  Within  Europe,  Hungarian  is  related  to  Finnish,  Esto- 
nian, Komi,  and  several  lesser-known  languages  spoken  in  parts 
of  the  Ural  Mountains  region  in  the  Soviet  Union.  It  has  a  heavy 
admixture  of  Turkish,  Slavic,  German,  Latin,  and  French  words. 
Hungarian  is  written  in  Latin  characters.  The  various  dialects  are 
intelligible  to  all  Hungarians  throughout  the  country. 

Minority  Groups 

In  the  1980s,  more  than  96  percent  of  the  population  consisted 
of  ethnic  Magyars.  Major  transfers  of  population  had  occurred  after 
World  War  II.  Substantial  numbers  of  Germans,  Czechs,  and  Slo- 
vaks were  resettled  in  neighboring  countries,  and  many  Hungari- 
ans outside  the  country's  borders  moved  to  Hungary.  Today 
Hungary  has  few  ethnic  minority  inhabitants.  In  the  1980s,  the 
population  included  roughly  230,000  Germans;  slightly  more  than 
100,000  Slovaks;  about  100,000  Serbs,  Croats,  and  Slovenes  (often 
grouped  together  as  South  Slavs);  and  about  30,000  Romanians. 
In  the  late  1980s,  the  Romanian  population  in  the  country  increased 
significantly  as  thousands  of  Romanians  fled  conditions  in  their 
homeland  and  sought  refuge  in  Hungary.  About  one-third  of  these 
emigres  were  ethnic  Romanians,  and  the  remainder  were  ethnic 
Hungarians.  In  addition,  about  500,000  Gypsies,  150,000  Jews, 
and  4,000  Greeks  lived  in  Hungary.  The  Jewish  community  was 
a  mere  remnant  of  the  Jewish  population  that  had  lived  in  the  coun- 
try before  World  War  II.  During  the  war,  as  many  as  540,000  Jews 
and  60,000  Gypsies  were  deported  to  Nazi  extermination  camps 
(see  World  War  II,  ch.  1). 

Most  of  the  non-Magyar  nationalities  were  bilingual,  speaking 
both  their  own  language  and  Hungarian.  In  the  1980  census,  less 
than  1  percent  of  the  population  actually  registered  as  members 
of  national  minorities,  although  a  far  greater  number  expressed 
interest  in  aspects  of  their  ethnic  culture.  National  minorities  did 
not  usually  form  separate  communities  but  lived  interspersed  among 
the  entire  population. 

The  Constitution,  as  well  as  a  sizable  body  of  law,  guarantees 
the  cultural  rights  of  recognized  national  minorities.  The  Consti- 
tution promises  them  equal  rights  as  citizens,  protection  against 
discrimination,  and  access  to  education  in  their  own  language  from 
kindergarten  to  university  level  (see  Constitutional  Development, 
ch.  4).  Minorities  have  been  able  to  promote  their  national  cul- 
tures through  freedom  of  association  in  federations,  ethnic  clubs, 
and  artistic  endeavors.  They  have  been  able  to  use  their  own  lan- 
guage in  official  procedures  and  could  publish  newspapers  and  peri- 
odicals, and  broadcast  radio  and  television  programs  in  their  own

tongue.  Actual  government  policy  in  the  1980s  was  fairly  consis- 
tent with  these  promises.  In  1984  approximately  55,000  minority 
students  were  receiving  instruction  in  their  mother  tongue  in 
elementary  and  secondary  schools,  up  from  21,615  students  in  1968. 
When  ethnic  students  did  not  find  the  requisite  opportunities  at 
domestic  institutions  of  higher  education,  they  could  study  at  ap- 
propriate foreign  universities.  All  national  minorities  had  weekly 
newspapers  and  other  publications  and  sponsored  various  cultural 
activities.  As  public  discussion  in  the  late  1980s  noted,  however, 
the  minorities  had  not  shared  equally  in  the  economic  advances 
of  recent  decades. 

Jews  and  Gypsies  were  not  officially  recognized  as  national 
minorities,  being  defined  rather  as  a  "religious  community"  and 
an  "ethnic  community,"  respectively.  However,  the  Jews  occupied 
a  more  favorable  position  in  Hungary  than  they  did  in  other  states 
in  Eastern  Europe.  The  country's  150,000  Jews  formed  the  third 
largest  Jewish  community  on  the  European  continent,  being  smaller 
than  the  Jewish  communities  in  the  Soviet  Union  and  France.  They 
maintained  a  high  school,  library,  museum,  kosher  butcher  shops, 
an  orphanage,  a  home  for  the  elderly,  a  rabbinical  seminary,  a  fac- 
tory producing  matzo,  and  about  thirty  synagogues.  Several  pub- 
lications, including  newspapers,  served  the  Jewish  population. 

The  situation  of  the  half  million  Gypsies,  traditionally  a  poor 
and  marginal  element  in  society  and  subject  to  discrimination,  was 


77 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

far  less  favorable.  In  1987  about  75  percent  of  the  Gypsies  were 
living  at  or  below  the  poverty  level.  About  half  of  them  lived  in 
settled  conditions,  holding  down  jobs.  Most  spoke  Hungarian.  The 
Gypsy  population  had  a  birth  rate  that  was  more  than  twice  as  high 
as  that  of  the  rest  of  the  population.  This  circumstance,  and  the 
fact  that  the  Gypsy  crime  rate  was  disproportionately  high,  con- 
tributed to  an  apparently  growing  hostility  to  Gypsies  among  the 
Hungarian  population.  Many  citizens  perceived  the  government's 
special  programs  for  Gypsies  as  undeserved  favoritism  that  deprived 
the  rest  of  the  population  of  needed  resources. 

In  the  mid-1980s,  in  contrast  to  its  earlier  policy  of  encouraging 
cultural  assimilation,  the  government  began  to  foster  a  Gypsy  ethnic 
and  cultural  identity  and  a  sense  of  community  and  tradition  to 
enhance  the  self-esteem  of  the  Gypsy  population.  In  mid- 1985  the 
government  established  the  National  Gypsy  Council  to  represent 
Gypsy  concerns  to  the  government  and  to  assist  in  carrying  out 
measures  involving  the  Gypsies.  In  1986  the  Cultural  Association 
of  Gypsies  in  Hungary  was  founded  to  help  preserve  and  foster 
Gypsy  culture.  In  1987  a  Gypsy  newspaper  was  established.  Despite 
these  signs  of  progress,  Gypsies  remained  particularly  vulnerable 
as  the  economic  climate  deteriorated  in  the  1980s.  With  minimal 
skills,  education,  and  training,  they  were  among  the  first  to  lose 
their  jobs  as  unemployment  increased.  Their  health  and  living  stan- 
dard remained  well  below  the  national  average.

Before  World  War  II,  Hungarian  society  was  characterized  by 
striking  inequalities  in  economic  and  social  status  (see  Social 
Changes,  ch.  1).  Landownership  was  the  principal  source  of  wealth, 
because  the  country  was  still  predominantly  rural  and  agricultural. 
The  poverty  of  millions  of  landless  laborers  stood  in  stark  contrast 
to  the  wealth  of  a  small  elite  of  landowners,  bankers,  and  promi- 
nent businessmen.  Early  efforts  at  industrialization  provided  few 
alternative  employment  opportunities  for  the  impoverished  agricul- 
tural labor  force. 

The  destruction  and  turmoil  of  World  War  II  greatly  disrupted 
the  traditional  social  structure.  After  the  communists  assumed 
power  in  1947,  society  was  in  flux  for  almost  two  decades  (see  Post- 
war Hungary,  ch.  1).  The  aim  of  the  new  government  was  to  replace 
the  old  order  with  a  new  social  structure  that  was  in  line  with 
Marxist-Leninist  ideology.  The  pace  of  change  slowed  in  the  early 
1960s  as  the  government  reduced  its  efforts  at  social  engineering. 
By  the  early  1970s,  society  had  settled  into  a  discernible  pattern 
in  which  clear-cut  social  strata  were  beginning  to  reemerge.  Changes 


78 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


that  continued  to  affect  the  social  system  during  the  1970s  and  1980s 
resulted  largely  from  economic  growth  and  urbanization  rather  than 
from  the  efforts  of  communist  social  planners. 

Interwar  Period 

Until  World  War  II,  striking  inequalities  distinguished  the  dis- 
tribution of  wealth,  power,  privilege,  and  opportunity  among  so- 
cial groups.  The  various  social  strata  had  different  codes  of  behavior 
and  distinctive  dress,  speech,  and  manners.  Respect  showed  to  per- 
sons varied  according  to  the  source  of  their  wealth.  Wealth  derived 
from  possession  of  land  was  valued  more  highly  than  that  coming 
from  trade  or  banking.  The  country  was  predominantiy  rural,  and 
landownership  was  the  central  factor  in  determining  the  status  and 
prestige  of  most  families.  In  some  of  the  middle  and  upper  strata 
of  society,  noble  birth  was  also  an  important  criterion  as  was,  in 
some  cases,  the  holding  of  certain  occupations.  An  intricate  sys- 
tem of  ranks  and  titles  distinguished  the  various  social  stations. 
Hereditary  titles  designated  the  aristocracy  and  gentry.  Persons 
who  had  achieved  positions  of  eminence,  whether  or  not  they  were 
of  noble  birth,  often  received  nonhereditary  titles  from  the  state. 
The  gradations  of  rank  derived  from  titles  had  great  significance 
in  social  intercourse  and  in  the  relations  between  the  individual 
and  the  state.  Among  the  rural  population,  which  consisted  largely 
of  peasants  and  which  made  up  the  overwhelming  majority  of  the 
country's  people,  distinctions  derived  from  such  factors  as  the  size 
of  a  family's  landholding;  whether  the  family  owned  the  land  and 
hired  help  to  work  it,  owned  and  worked  the  land  itself,  or  worked 
for  others;  and  family  reputation.  The  prestige  and  respect  accom- 
panying landownership  were  evident  in  many  facets  of  life  in  the 
countryside,  from  finely  shaded  modes  of  polite  address,  to  spe- 
cial church  seating,  to  selection  of  landed  peasants  to  fill  public 
offices. 

On  the  eve  of  World  War  II,  about  4  percent  of  the  population 
owned  more  than  half  the  country's  wealth.  Landowners,  wealthy 
bankers,  aristocrats  and  gentry,  and  various  commercial  leaders 
made  up  the  elite.  Together,  these  groups  accounted  for  only  13 
percent  of  the  population.  Between  10  and  18  percent  of  the  popu- 
lation consisted  of  the  petite  bourgeoisie  and  the  petty  gentry,  var- 
ious government  officials,  intellectuals,  retail  store  owners,  and 
well-to-do  professionals.  More  than  two- thirds  of  the  remaining 
population  lived  in  varying  degrees  of  poverty.  Their  only  real 
chance  for  upward  mobility  lay  in  becoming  civil  servants,  but  such 
advancement  was  difficult  because  of  the  exclusive  nature  of  the 
education  system  (see  Education,  this  ch.).  The  industrial  working 


79 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

class  was  growing,  but  the  largest  group  remained  the  peasantry, 
most  of  whom  had  too  little  land  or  none  at  all. 

Although  the  interwar  years  witnessed  considerable  cultural  and 
economic  progress  in  the  country,  the  social  structure  changed  lit- 
tle. A  great  chasm  remained  between  the  gentry,  both  social  and 
intellectual,  and  the  rural  "people."  Jews  held  a  place  of  promi- 
nence in  the  country's  economic,  social,  and  political  life.  They 
constituted  the  bulk  of  the  middle  class.  During  the  first  four  de- 
cades of  the  twentieth  century,  Jews  made  up  more  than  one-fifth 
of  the  population  of  Budapest.  They  were  well  assimilated,  worked 
in  a  variety  of  professions,  and  were  of  various  political  persuasions. 

Postwar  Societal  Transformation 

Even  before  the  communists  came  to  power  in  1947,  the  turbu- 
lent years  of  World  War  II  had  weakened  or  eliminated  much  of 
the  old  stratified  society.  Devastation  from  the  fighting  in  1944  and 
1945,  land  reforms  instituted  by  the  government  in  1945,  and  the 
nationalization  of  commerce  and  industry  between  1948  and  1953 
destroyed  the  economic  base  of  the  old  social  system.  The  country 
lost  about  300,000  Jews,  including  much  of  the  Jewish  business 
community,  to  various  war-related  causes — deportation,  massacre, 
disease,  and  hunger.  Only  about  260,500,  mostly  from  Budapest, 
survived  (see  World  War  II,  ch.  1). 

After  the  communist  takeover,  the  traditional  ruling  class  was 
virtually  eliminated.  More  extensive  land  reform  undertaken  by 
the  new  regime  eventually  collectivized  the  majority  of  the  peasan- 
try. In  the  countryside,  anti-kulak  measures  and  compulsory  deliv- 
eries of  produce  to  the  state  at  extremely  low  prices  destroyed  the 
prosperous  peasant  class.  (In  1948  the  term  kulak  came  to  be  de- 
fined officially  as  anyone  who  owned  more  than  seven  hectares  of 
land  or  had  a  landed  income  roughly  approximating  such  owner- 
ship. Political  conditions  caused  many  with  less  property  also  to 
feel  threatened.)  Rampant  inflation  disrupted  all  aspects  of  eco- 
nomic life. 

In  keeping  with  Marxist-Leninist  ideology,  during  the  first  de- 
cade of  communist  rule  the  government  sought  to  create  a  class- 
less society  through  policies  such  as  equalization  of  incomes, 
collectivization  of  agriculture,  expropriation  of  property,  and  tight 
control  over  educational  opportunities  (see  Rakosi's  Rule,  ch.  1). 
On  the  remaining  peasants  with  average  incomes  and  on  prosper- 
ous peasants,  the  government  imposed  steeply  progressive  income 
taxes  and  requisitioned  large  amounts  of  produce.  Collectivization 
in  the  early  1950s  caused  many  peasants  to  seek  alternatives  to 
agriculture.  Many  retained  their  rural  residences  but  commuted 


80 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


daily  or  weekly  to  other  jobs,  leaving  part  of  the  family  to  con- 
tinue some  agricultural  work.  Others  moved  to  entirely  new  jobs, 
as  government  policies  promoted  rapid  development  of  heavy  in- 
dustry (see  Economic  Policy  and  Performance,  1945-85,  ch.  3). 

The  social  and  economic  changes  that  took  place  after  World 
War  II  promoted  social  mobility.  During  the  early  years  of  forced 
industrialization  and  continuing  to  a  lesser  extent  until  the  early 
1960s,  the  prewar  worker  strata  and  peasant  strata  had  enhanced 
opportunities  to  rise  into  white-collar  positions.  Large  numbers  of 
peasants  entered  the  industrial  labor  force,  and  the  bureaucracy, 
which  grew  as  a  result  of  centralized  planning,  was  open  to  per- 
sons from  all  social  groups. 

Some  downward  mobility  also  occurred.  Disincentives  for  for- 
merly independent  professionals,  crafts  people,  and  merchants  were 
overwhelming.  Opportunities  also  dwindled  for  prewar  executives 
and  managers.  Members  of  the  old  elite  lost  property  and  political 
power  and  were  forced  into  the  middle  or  lower  class.  A  large  per- 
centage of  the  prewar  elite  left  the  country. 

Despite  such  mobility  in  the  early  1950s,  an  inegalitarian  social 
system  remained  in  place.  The  new  political  elite  enjoyed  mate- 
rial and  symbolic  privileges,  such  as  access  to  special  stores  con- 
taining scarce  goods  or  the  free  use  of  secluded  and  well-guarded 
villas,  that  separated  it  from  the  rest  of  the  population.  A  second 
stratum  of  the  elite  consisted  of  valuable  persons  such  as  directors 
of  large  enterprises  and  of  the  best  collective  farms.  They  too  lived 
in  comparative  luxury.  The  new  elite  also  included  intellectuals 
who  endorsed  the  party  and  its  interests.  Their  task  was  to  pro- 
vide legitimacy  for  the  new  regime.  In  return,  they  enjoyed  living 
standards  superior  to  those  of  the  working  class. 

In  the  aftermath  of  the  Revolution  of  1956,  career  restrictions 
on  the  prewar  middle  class  and  intellectuals  began  to  ease  some- 
what as  the  government  ceased  most  of  its  social  engineering  ef- 
forts (see  Revolution  of  1956,  ch.  1).  Among  workers  and  peasants, 
political  loyalty,  although  important,  could  no  longer  serve  as  a 
vehicle  for  upward  mobility  in  the  absence  of  other  qualifications; 
a  person  also  needed  to  have  appropriate  educational  credentials 
or  skills.  However,  political  considerations  remained  paramount 
for  persons  who  , wanted  to  be  part  of  the  ruling  political  elite. 

As  the  economic  reforms  introduced  in  the  1960s  increasingly 
affected  all  aspects  of  society,  stratified  social  groups  again  made 
their  appearance.  By  the  mid-1970s,  the  regime's  objective  of  a 
classless  society  appeared  to  be  increasingly  unattainable.  To  recon- 
cile ideology  with  these  realities,  ideologists  began  modifying 
Marxist  theory.  The  regime  all  but  abandoned  the  goal  of  a  classless 


81

society,  ideologists  arguing  that  in  a  socialist  industrial  society  cer- 
tain skills  and  occupations  were  more  necessary  than  others.  Thus, 
those  persons  with  greater  skills  and  responsibilities  should  receive 
more  compensation  than  those  making  less  valuable  contributions. 
Ideologists  rationalized  society's  inequalities  by  maintaining  that 
socioeconomic  distinctions  that  evolved  under  a  communist  sys- 
tem were  qualitatively  different  from  those  found  in  capitalist 
countries. 

Social  Relations  in  the  1980s 

In  the  1980s,  society  was  complex  and  highly  differentiated.  Social 
scientists  agreed  that  the  traditional  Marxist-Leninist  description 
of  the  workers,  peasants,  and  intellectuals  all  cooperating  to  build 
socialism  did  not  accurately  depict  modern  society.  They  actively 
sought  new  categories  to  account  for  the  great  diversity  of  life-styles 
and  income  sources  but  as  of  the  late  1980s  had  not  reached  a  con- 
sensus concerning  modifications  in  traditional  theories. 

Most  sociologists  spoke  of  the  existence  of  three  major  strata  in 
society:  white-collar  workers  engaged  in  mental  labor;  manual 
laborers;  and  peasants.  The  white-collar  category  comprised  every- 
one not  involved  in  physical  labor — party  and  government  leaders, 
intellectuals,  professionals  and  teachers,  collective  farm  managers, 
artists,  business  persons,  traders,  shop  owners,  and  specialists  such 
as  building  contractors.  This  category  constituted  30.3  percent  of 
active  earners  in  1987,  with  14.5  percent  classified  as  professionals. 
The  manual  labor  category  encompassed  61.4  percent  of  the  work 
force  and  included  skilled,  semiskilled,  and  unskilled  blue-collar 
workers  of  all  ranks  and  degrees  of  training  and  prosperity.  The 
peasantry  working  on  both  cooperative  and  state  farms  made  up 
8.3  percent  of  earners.  About  4.6  percent  of  the  work  force  were 
also  "small-scale  producers"  of  various  types. 

A  survey  taken  in  1981  revealed  the  surprisingly  widespread  na- 
ture of  small-scale  agricultural  production  among  virtually  all  so- 
cial categories  and  occupations;  62.7  percent  of  active  earners  lived 
in  households  that  cultivated  at  least  small  gardens  of  fruit  trees 
or  vegetables.  A  smaller  but  still  substantial  number  of  active  earners 
were  involved  in  animal  husbandry  (see  Agricultural  Organiza- 
tion, ch.  3).  Sociologists  were  uncertain  about  whether  or  not  this 
phenomenon  was  a  temporary  phase  in  industrial  development  or 
a  new  category  of  agricultural  worker. 

The  Elite 

Persons  with  some  claim  to  elite  status  made  up  no  more  than 
15  percent  of  the  population  in  the  early  1980s.  The  elite  consisted 


82 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


of  three  identifiable  groups  in  the  1980s:  political,  technocratic, 
and  intellectual.  The  political  elite  consisted  of  top  party  and  govern- 
ment leaders.  Although  some  members  of  this  group  flaunted  their 
status  and  privileges,  most  were  not  highly  visible  and  did  not  ad- 
vertise their  special  status.  Members  appeared  to  be  relatively  sen- 
sitive to  their  public  image  and  did  not  indulge  in  conspicuous 
consumption.  The  technocrats  included  managers,  directors, 
economists,  and  researchers  who  supported  the  regime.  The  benefits 
they  derived  from  the  system  were  more  visible,  in  the  form  of 
bonuses  and  salaries  and  of  the  autombiles,  villas,  apartments,  and 
other  special  advantages  that  these  financial  windfalls  made  possi- 
ble. The  intellectual  elite,  composed  of  academicians,  scientists, 
musicians,  artists,  writers,  journalists,  and  actors,  included  many 
persons  who  were  comfortably  placed,  although  others  lived  in  rela- 
tively humble  circumstances.  They  were  leaders  in  setting  both  so- 
cial and  political  trends.  Members  of  these  favored  groups  often 
possessed,  in  addition  to  relative  wealth,  the  important  commodity 
of  influence  or  ''connections."  This  form  of  influence  gave  them 
and  their  families  access  to  scarce  items  and  limited  opportunities, 
such  as  quality  higher  education. 

Additional  occupations  that  were  likely  to  be  financially  rewarding 
included  medicine,  engineering,  and,  in  some  cases,  skilled  tech- 
nicial  jobs,  such  as  electrical  work,  house  painting,  plumbing,  and 
building  contracting.  These  technicians  might  have  several  income 
sources  from  their  private  work  in  addition  to  salaried  work.  In- 
tellectuals who  lacked  high  salaries  but  supplemented  their  income 
through  various  types  of  consulting  work,  such  as  editing,  trans- 
lating, and  so  forth,  were  also  financially  secure. 

Prosperous  individuals  enjoyed  a  very  comfortable  standard  of 
living.  Families  who  could  afford  private  holiday  and  weekend 
houses  built  them  on  the  shores  of  Lake  Balaton,  along  rivers,  and 
in  mountain  areas.  From  1981  through  1987,  a  total  of  30,397  pri- 
vate "holiday  houses"  were  built.  As  more  people  owned  their  own 
automobiles,  weekend  trips  became  increasingly  popular.  During 
the  1970s,  more  people,  even  those  in  relatively  modest  circum- 
stances, began  to  travel  abroad.  In  1981  a  record  5.5  million  Hun- 
garians traveled  outside  Hungary.  Of  these,  about  477,000  traveled 
to  capitalist  countries,  in  Europe  or  overseas.  As  a  result  of  finan- 
cial constraints,  the  number  of  travelers  dropped  somewhat  in  the 
mid-1980s.  Regulations  concerning  the  exchange  of  foreign  cur- 
rency permitted  travel  to  capitalist  countries  no  more  than  once 
a  year  on  organized  tours  or  once  every  three  years  on  an  individual 
basis.  If  a  traveler  had  access  to  additional  sources  of  foreign  cur- 
rency, however,  he  or  she  could  travel  more  frequently.

The  Disadvantaged 

To  achieve  an  acceptable  living  standard  or  to  improve  their 
modest  circumstances,  most  Hungarians  had  to  work  hard;  often 
they  held  more  than  one  job.  Continuing  inflation  in  the  1980s 
created  additional  pressures  on  families  with  moderate  income. 
Although  the  government  introduced  the  five-day  workweek 
throughout  the  economy  between  1980  and  1985,  more  persons 
worked  extended  workdays  to  increase  household  income.  It  was 
estimated  that  three  families  in  four  had  some  source  of  additional 
income  not  resulting  from  work  in  state  or  collective  sources.  Many 
families  were  thus  able  to  achieve  a  comfortable,  if  still  modest, 
life-style. 

A  number  of  disadvantaged  groups  also  tried  to  make  ends  meet. 
Western  analysts  estimated  that  between  25  and  40  percent  of  the 
population  lived  below  the  poverty  level,  which,  in  the  mid-1980s, 
was  defined  as  a  monthly  income  below  5,200  forints  (for  value 
of  the  forint — see  Glossary).  Average  monthly  wages  (6,000  forints) 
were  only  10  to  15  percent  above  this  level.  In  1988,  according 
to  data  issued  by  the  Central  Statistical  Office,  between  1.5  mil- 
lion and  3  million  people  qualified  as  "socially  poor"  (out  of  a  popu- 
lation of  10.6  million).  These  figures  included  40  to  50  percent  of 
all  retired  persons  on  pensions,  about  half  of  families  with  two  chil- 
dren, and  from  70  to  90  percent  of  families  with  three  or  more  chil- 
dren. Other  poor  groups  were  low-paid  employees  of  the  state  and 
industry,  such  as  postal  employees,  various  semiskilled  and  un- 
skilled workers,  and  minor  bureaucrats.  Some  of  these  people 
supplemented  their  income  through  second  jobs.  Single  heads  of 
households  were  often  poor.  In  addition,  persons  working  on  less 
productive  collective  farms  and  those  living  on  isolated  homesteads 
(tanyas)  far  from  rural  centers  and  even  villages,  were  likely  to  have 
scanty  incomes. 

Although  Hungary's  living  standard  was  higher  than  that  found 
in  neighboring  socialist  states  in  the  1980s,  the  sharp  disparities 
became  the  subject  of  investigative  reports,  letters  to  newspaper 
editors,  and  various  radio  and  television  talk  shows.  Economic 
problems  were  clearly  causing  concern  and  some  demoralization 
among  the  people.  The  government  adopted  a  variety  of  austerity 
measures  in  response  to  the  country's  economic  stagnation  and  stag- 
gering foreign  debt.  These  measures  included  increases  in  the  prices 
of  basic  items,  such  as  flour,  bread,  gasoline,  and  household  energy, 
and  various  consumer  items  such  as  cigarettes.  A  new  value-added 
tax  (see  Glossary)  on  most  goods  and  services  and  a  stricter  income 
tax  law  were  also  introduced  (see  Economic  Regulators,  ch.  3). 


84 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 

In  1988  official  sources  reported  an  inflation  rate  of  17  percent. 
Western  analysts  estimated  that  the  inflation  rate  could  be  as  high 
as  25  to  30  percent.  By  1989  the  average  real  wage  had  dropped 
to  its  1973  level. 

Since  the  mid-1970s,  considerable  tension  has  emerged  between 
the  rich  and  the  poor,  partially  because  of  the  long-professed 
egalitarian  views  of  the  regime.  During  the  immediate  postwar 
period,  the  leadership  had  advocated  (although  it  had  never  fully 
practiced)  a  general  egalitarianism  that,  combined  with  the  prevail- 
ing scarcity,  led  people  to  elevate  self-denial  as  a  socialist  virtue. 
When  conditions  subsequently  improved,  the  leadership  and  the 
population  both  were  confused  about  what  form  the  proper  socialist 
way  of  life  should  take.  The  younger  generation  in  particular  took 
pleasure  in  the  increasing  comforts  of  life,  but  some  members  of 
the  older  generation  feared  a  resurgence  of  a  "bourgeois"  life-style 
and  "consumerism."  Although  poverty  remained  widespread, 
socialism's  sponsorship  of  rapid  economic  development  had  offered 
many  persons  a  chance  to  change  their  way  of  life  and  socioeconomic 
position  in  a  manner  that  was  unimaginable  before  the  war.  As 
living  standards  improved,  the  conviction  had  grown  among  sig- 
nificant segments  of  the  population  that  economic  growth  and  ris- 
ing standards  were  inevitable  and  that  ongoing  problems — poverty 
and  unequal  opportunity — were  remnants  of  the  old  order,  cer- 
tain to  be  overcome.  Then  in  the  mid-1970s,  economic  growth  had 
slowed.  Although  inequalities  were  much  reduced  from  the  prewar 
scale,  they  still  existed.  They  were  less  pronounced  in  salary  differ- 
ences than  they  were  in  working  conditions,  working  hours  (in- 
cluding their  flexibility),  housing  conditions,  possession  of  durable 
consumer  items,  and,  most  of  all,  general  life-style.  Even  more  trou- 
bling was  the  appearance  of  new  inequalities,  with  favored  groups 
consolidating  their  advantageous  positions.  The  regime  had  few 
concrete  answers  for  these  problems.  Leaders  could  only  point  out 
that  the  country  had  no  models  to  follow  in  developing  a  socialist 
system  to  meet  its  needs. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  worsening  economic  conditions  were  a  dis- 
appointing contrast  to  the  successes  and  significant  improvements 
in  living  standards  achieved  in  the  1960s  and  1970s.  In  1987  the 
official  news  agency  estimated  the  number  of  unemployed  per- 
sons to  be  30,000  to  40,000.  In  1988  the  press  began  report- 
ing frankly  on  the  noticeable  numbers  of  beggars  and  homeless 
persons  on  the  streets  of  Budapest.  The  media  also  noted  that  squat- 
ters were  becoming  a  problem,  especially  families  coming  from  the 
countryside  seeking  employment  and  moving  into  vacant  apart- 
ments.

Social  Institutions 

In  the  1980s,  severe  social  and  economic  problems  took  their 
toll  on  the  family.  Harsh  economic  conditions  meant  that  most 
women  had  to  work  and  most  men  had  to  hold  second  and  even 
third  jobs.  These  factors,  combined  with  a  housing  shortage,  sub- 
jected the  family  to  considerable  stress.  Yet  the  harsh  economic 
conditions  also  forced  many  people  to  turn  inward,  and  they  found 
in  their  families  a  refuge  from  the  difficult  economic  realities. 

In  the  postwar  period,  the  regime  had  designed  its  mass  organi- 
zations to  take  over  some  of  the  traditional  socialization  functions 
of  the  family.  Thus,  the  mass  organizations  served  as  "transmis- 
sion belts,"  attempting  to  inculcate  regime  values,  and  relaying 
and  interpreting  the  policies  of  the  Hungarian  Socialist  Workers' 
Party  (HSWP)  to  rank-and-file  members  and  to  the  general  pub- 
lic (see  Hungarian  Socialist  Workers'  Party,  ch.  4).  In  the  late 
1980s,  some  Western  observers  considered  the  mass  organizations 
sponsored  by  the  regime  to  be  in  a  moribund  state,  hopelessly  out- 
classed by  newer,  more  spontaneous  collective  efforts  (see  Dissent 
and  Freedom  of  Expression,  this  ch.).  In  response,  some  mass  or- 
ganizations liberalized  their  programs  and  distanced  themselves 
from  the  regime. 

Early  in  its  history,  the  communist  party  considered  the  churches 
as  competitors  for  the  allegiance  of  the  people.  Therefore,  the  re- 
gime actively  persecuted  the  churches,  especially  the  Roman  Catho- 
lic Church.  After  the  Revolution  of  1956,  the  regime  relaxed  its 
pressure  on  the  churches,  viewing  them  more  as  partners  than  as 
adversaries.  By  the  late  1980s,  the  government  allowed  the  churches 
wide  latitude  and  eliminated  virtually  all  legal  and  institutional  re- 
strictions on  church  activities. 

The  Family 

In  traditional  Hungary,  the  family  served  as  the  basic  social  unit. 
It  had  multiple  functions,  providing  security  and  identity  to  in- 
dividuals and  reinforcing  social  values.  In  rural  areas,  it  was  also 
the  basic  economic  unit— all  members  worked  together  for  the 
material  well-being  of  the  whole  family.  Even  before  World  War 
II,  however,  family  cohesion  began  to  decrease  as  members  be- 
came increasingly  mobile.  But  the  process  of  change  quickened  after 
the  communist  takeover.  Intensive  industrialization  and  forced  col- 
lectivization prompted  many  of  the  younger  peasants  to  leave 
agriculture  for  industrial  work  or  other  jobs  in  the  cities,  some  com- 
muting long  distances  between  home  and  work  (see  Postwar  Socie- 
tal Transformation,  this  ch.).  Patterns  of  family  life  changed.  A 


86 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


growing  number  of  women  worked  outside  the  home,  and  chil- 
dren spent  much  of  their  time  in  school  or  in  youth  organization 
activities.  Family  members  spent  less  time  together.  The  empha- 
sis in  daily  life  shifted  from  the  family  to  the  outside  world.  Most 
members  of  the  extended  family  came  together  only  for  important 
ceremonies,  such  as  weddings  or  funerals,  and  other  special  oc- 
casions. 

Changes  in  the  traditional  roles  of  family  members  were  dra- 
matic. The  dominance  of  the  male  head  of  the  family  diminished. 
The  remaining  family  members  had  greater  independence.  Most 
notably,  the  role  of  women  changed.  By  1987  about  75  percent 
of  working- age  women  were  gainfully  employed.  Even  peasant 
women  became  wage  earners  on  the  collective  farms.  This  fact  al- 
tered women's  status  in  the  family  and  the  community.  However, 
most  observers  agreed  that  in  the  1980s  males  were  still  viewed 
as  the  head  of  most  households,  if  only  because  of  their  generally 
higher  incomes. 

As  women  increasingly  worked  outside  the  home,  their  husbands 
and  children  assumed  some  domestic  functions,  helping  with  house- 
hold chores  more  than  they  had  before.  Outside  institutions  such 
as  schools  and  nurseries  also  took  over  tasks  formerly  carried  out 
by  women  within  the  home.  Nevertheless,  time  budget  studies  in- 
dicated that  women  were  still  responsible  for  most  of  the  child  rear- 
ing and  housework  despite  their  employment  outside  the  home. 
Women  usually  worked  longer  hours  than  men.  Working  women 
spent  an  average  of  more  than  four  hours  each  day  on  household 
chores,  including  child  care,  while  men  averaged  ninety- seven 
minutes  in  such  activities.  However,  the  time  spent  by  women  in 
outside  employment  was  not  correspondingly  shorter  than  that  of 
men,  averaging  only  1 .5  hours  less  than  men.  Women  devoted  less 
time  than  men  to  leisure  activities,  such  as  watching  television,  so- 
cializing, and  engaging  in  sports.  (According  to  the  same  studies, 
women  did  read  approximately  as  many  books  as  men  but  spent 
much  less  time  on  newspapers  and  periodicals.) 

The  state  viewed  marriage  as  a  secular  matter,  governed  by  civil 
law.  A  civil  marriage  was  mandatory,  but  couples  were  allowed 
to  supplement  the  procedure  with  a  religious  ceremony.  The  greatest 
number  of  both  men  and  women  married  between  the  ages  of 
twenty  and  twenty-four  (44.6  percent  of  all  men  and  41.3  percent 
of  all  women  for  those  marrying  in  1987).  The  law  assigned  equal 
rights  and  obligations  to  both  partners  in  a  marriage. 

In  the  1980s,  social  analysts  considered  the  family  to  be  an  in- 
stitution under  considerable  stress.  Statistics  supported  this  con- 
tention. From  1975  to  1986,  the  divorce  rate  increased  from  2.5 


87 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


to  2.8  per  1,000  population.  In  the  1980s,  every  third  marriage 
ended  in  divorce.  The  rate  of  remarriage  also  dropped  significantly. 
In  1987  about  66,000  marriages  were  performed,  and  about  95,600 
marriages  were  terminated  as  a  result  of  death  or  divorce.  Almost 
12  percent  of  all  families  were  headed  by  a  single  parent. 

A  primary  source  of  stress  within  families,  according  to  many 
observers,  was  the  scarcity  of  adequate  housing,  especially  for  young 
families  (see  Health  and  Welfare,  this  ch.).  In  many  families,  mem- 
bers faced  the  pressures  and  exhaustion  of  trying  to  hold  down  mul- 
tiple jobs.  Another  source  of  tension  within  families  was  the 
prevalence  of  commuting.  Although  in  1960  one  in  every  eight 
workers  commuted,  in  the  1980s  one  in  every  four  commuted.  One 
million  or  more  villagers  commuted  to  the  cities  to  work.  This  figure 
did  not  include  long-distance  commuters  who  lived  in  temporary 
quarters  near  their  workplaces  and  returned  home  weekly  or  more 
infrequently.  In  1980  such  workers  numbered  about  270,000,  bring- 
ing the  total  number  of  commuters  to  about  1.5  million. 

Despite  the  statistics,  most  observers  found  that  the  cohesive  force 
of  the  family  remained  relatively  strong  in  the  1980s.  For  many 
people,  the  family  continued  to  be  a  source  of  personal  comfort 
and  reassurance  in  the  face  of  worsening  economic  conditions.  The 
traditional  sense  of  family  loyalty  and  responsibility  also  seemed 
to  survive.  Family  members  continued  to  help  each  other  in  find- 
ing jobs  or  housing,  in  gaining  admission  to  schools,  and  in  provid- 
ing for  each  other  in  times  of  need. 

Mass  Organizations 

Until  the  late  1980s,  the  law  contained  no  provision  for  volun- 
tary, independent  associations  of  people  interested  in  influencing 
social  or  political  policy.  Potential  independent  groups  had  no  con- 
crete channels  by  which  to  gain  regime  approval.  During  four  de- 
cades of  communist  rule,  clear  legal  status  belonged  only  to  such 
mass  organizations  as  the  Communist  Youth  League,  official  trade 
unions,  the  National  Council  of  Hungarian  Women,  and  a  vari- 
ety of  nonpolitical  associations  catering  to  narrow,  special  interests 
of  the  population.  Until  the  late  1980s,  authorities  actively  dis- 
couraged the  formation  of  unofficial  groups. 

Trade  Unions 

In  the  mid-1980s,  official  trade  unions  had  almost  4.4  million 
members,  or  about  96  percent  of  all  persons  living  on  wages  and 
salaries.  The  growth  of  trade  unions  was  mainly  a  post- World  War 
II  phenomenon;  before  the  war,  unions  had  a  total  membership 
of  only  about  100,000  (mostly  crafts  people).  After  the  communist 


88 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


takeover,  the  unions  were  supervised  by  the  National  Council  of 
Trade  Unions  (Szakszervezetek  Orszagos  Tanacsa — SZOT), 
elected  by  a  national  congress.  SZOT  had  nineteen  officially  recog- 
nized unions,  organized  by  industrial  branch.  Trade  unions  theo- 
retically had  great  powers,  but  they  traditionally  had  made  little 
use  of  them.  For  example,  SZOT  had  a  legal  right  to  veto  deci- 
sions made  by  the  government  concerning  the  workers.  In  prac- 
tice, the  unions'  historic  inability  to  strike  made  this  authority 
meaningless.  The  government  specified  overall  policy  concerning 
work  requirements  and  wages.  Most  day-to-day  decisions  about 
hiring  and  firing  were  made  by  the  management  staffs  of  enter- 
prises and  collective  farms.  Unions  did  have  great  influence  in  the 
use  of  the  social  and  cultural  funds  of  enterprises  and  in  industrial 
safety  issues.  Trade  unions  also  controlled  the  administration  of 
health  care  and  holiday  resorts.  However,  in  the  1980s  subsidies 
from  the  central  government  for  these  purposes  were  diminishing, 
so  that  maintaining  even  the  existing  level  of  services  and  ameni- 
ties was  difficult. 

In  1985,  in  a  move  to  increase  its  appeal  to  the  country's  youth, 
SZOT  set  up  its  own  organization  to  represent  young  people, 
separate  from  the  Communist  Youth  League.  This  organization 
was  the  first,  other  than  the  Communist  Youth  League  itself,  to 
officially  represent  young  people.  According  to  the  authorities,  the 
Communist  Youth  League  was  to  remain  the  only  political  mass 
organization  for  youth,  while  the  trade  union  youth  would  focus 
on  issues  of  the  workplace,  social  and  cultural  programs,  and  other 
traditional  concerns  of  trade  unions.  Trade  union  members  under 
thirty  years  of  age  could  be  members  of  the  unions'  new  youth 
sections. 

In  the  late  1980s,  Western  analysts  detected  a  significant  easing 
of  restrictions  on  trade  union  activity  in  general.  The  official  unions 
became  increasingly  outspoken,  criticizing  such  practices  as  the  re- 
quirement for  overtime  work  and  other  austerity  measures.  In  pub- 
lic discussions,  both  critics  and  union  representatives  openly 
admitted  that  the  unions  as  constituted  inspired  little  confidence 
in  workers.  In  1988  the  press  began  reporting  some  brief  strikes 
among  workers  in  officially  recognized  unions,  revealing  that  the 
outcomes  of  the  strikes  had  been  favorable  to  the  workers.  At  the 
same  time,  some  professionals  and  blue-collar  workers  made  ef- 
forts to  form  independent  unions  that  were  not  subordinate  to 
SZOT.  In  May  1988,  the  Democratic  Union  of  Scientific  Work- 
ers, the  first  independent  trade  union  established  in  Eastern  Europe 
since  Poland's  Solidarity,  was  founded.  Social  scientists  at  research 
institutes  of  the  Academy  of  Sciences,  the  country's  premier  research 


89 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

organization,  were  the  first  members  of  the  new  union.  The  union's 
program  included  a  call  for  the  end  of  discrimination  against  profes- 
sionals based  on  their  political  views.  Additional  researchers  and 
teachers  from  other  institutions  soon  joined,  raising  the  number 
of  members  to  more  than  4,000  by  December  1988.  Several  smaller 
unions  also  came  into  existence.  Initially,  the  membership  of  such 
independent  organizations  appeared  to  be  limited  to  white-collar 
workers.  The  success  of  these  fledgling  attempts  was  uncertain,  but 
after  initial  hostility  from  authorities,  the  groups  were  permitted 
to  function. 

Women 

In  the  1980s,  the  principal  women's  organization  was  the  Na- 
tional Council  of  Hungarian  Women.  Its  official  role  was  to  edu- 
cate women  socially  and  politically  and  to  participate  in  devising 
new  laws  and  regulations  that  affected  women.  The  organization 
had  a  network  of  local  and  regional  committees,  whose  members 
engaged  in  voluntary  social  work.  In  1985  the  council  had  about 
32,000  designated  female  "stewards,"  and  about  160,000  women 
were  said  to  be  active  in  the  organization. 

Youth 

The  Communist  Youth  League  (Kommunista  Ifjusagi  Szovet- 
seg — KISZ)  catered  to  young  people.  KISZ  was  the  HSWP's  offi- 
cial youth  organization  (see  Hungarian  Socialist  Workers'  Party, 
ch.  4).  It  claimed  to  represent  all  the  country's  youth  and  sought 
to  educate  young  people  politically  and  to  supervise  political  as  well 
as  some  social  activities  for  them.  KISZ  was  the  most  important 
source  of  new  members  for  the  party.  Its  organizational  framework 
paralleled  that  of  the  HSWP  and  included  a  congress,  central  com- 
mittee, secretariat,  and  regional  and  local  committees.  Member- 
ship was  open  to  youth  from  the  ages  of  fourteen  to  twenty-six  years, 
but  most  of  the  full-time  leaders  of  the  organization  were  well  over 
the  age  limit.  In  the  1980s,  KISZ  had  about  800,000  members. 
Membership  was  common,  if  rather  pro  forma,  among  university 
students  (96  percent  of  whom  were  members)  but  was  lower  among 
young  people  already  working  (31  percent). 

In  the  late  1980s,  KISZ  undertook  sweeping  reforms  of  its  own 
organizational  structure.  In  April  1989  delegates  to  the  organiza- 
tion's national  congress  voted  to  change  the  name  of  the  organiza- 
tion to  the  Democratic  Youth  Federation.  According  to  declarations 
adopted  by  the  congress,  the  newly  refashioned  federation  would 
be  a  voluntary  league  of  independent  youth  organizations  and  would 
not  accept  direction  from  any  single  party,  including  the  HSWP. 


90 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


A  separate  organization  within  KISZ,  the  Association  of  Young 
Pioneers,  was  formed  for  youngsters  in  elementary  school.  Mem- 
bership was  open  to  children  from  six  to  fourteen  years  of  age.  The 
Young  Pioneers  served  many  of  the  same  functions  as  the  Boy 
Scouts  and  Girl  Scouts  in  the  West.  The  organization  also  attempted 
to  explain  to  children  the  basic  tenets  of  the  Marxist-Leninist  world- 
view.  Joining  the  Young  Pioneers  was  a  matter  of  course  for  most 
youngsters  in  elementary  school.  Most  meetings  took  place  in  class- 
rooms of  primary  schools.  Bands  of  Young  Pioneers  could  be  seen 
on  many  ceremonial  occasions,  dressed  in  the  organization's  charac- 
teristic white  shirts  and  red  ties.  The  summer  camps  sponsored 
by  the  organization  were  a  highlight  of  the  year  for  many  children. 

Other  Popular  Groups 

In  addition  to  the  traditional  mass  organizations,  a  myriad  of 
other  officially  approved  clubs  and  associations  focused  narrowly 
on  such  areas  as  agriculture,  architecture,  history,  mathematics, 
music,  the  sciences,  and  so  forth.  A  survey  in  the  early  1980s 
counted  6,570  cultural,  professional,  and  sports  associations  (63 
percent  of  which  had  been  established  after  1945),  ..1th  a  total  of 
2.3  million  members.  The  largest  associations  were  the  Hungar- 
ian Autoclub,  with  about  291,000  members  in  late  1982,  and  the 
National  Association  of  Stamp  Collectors,  with  approximately 
157,000  members.  Also  worthy  of  note  was  the  Home  Defense  Sport 
Federation,  which  promoted  physical  fitness  for  the  masses  and 
sponsored  premilitary  training  for  young  people.  Many  Hungari- 
ans were  also  avid  sports  fans  and  participants.  In  1985  more  than 
1.2  million  persons  belonged  to  the  country's  3,860  sports  clubs. 
The  most  popular  sport  was  soccer.  Chess  was  also  widely  played. 

Religion  and  Religious  Organizations 

Particularly  during  the  early  years  of  communist  rule,  the 
churches  had  faced  extensive  harassment  and  persecution  by  the 
regime.  Many  clergy  had  been  openly  hostile  to  the  new  govern- 
ment at  its  inception.  The  new  secular  authorities,  for  their  part, 
denounced  such  attitudes  as  traitorous,  and  they  mistrusted  the 
churches  as  a  source  of  opposition. 

The  most  protracted  case  of  tension  and  open  conflict  involved 
the  Roman  Catholic  Church.  In  1945  the  church  lost  its  landed 
property  in  the  first  postwar  land  reform,  which  occurred  before 
the  communist  takeover.  Most  Catholic  religious  orders  (fifty-nine 
of  a  total  of  sixty-three  groups)  were  dissolved  in  1948,  when  reli- 
gious schools  were  also  taken  over  by  the  state.  Most  Catholic  as- 
sociations and  clubs,  which  numbered  about  4,000,  were  forced 


91 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

to  disband.  Imprisoned  and  prosecuted  for  political  resistance  to 
the  communist  regime  were  a  number  of  clergy,  most  notably  Jozsef 
Cardinal  Mindszenty.  primate  of  the  Catholic  Church  in  Hungary 
(see  Postwar  Hungary,  ch.  1).  In  1950  about  2.500  monks  and 
nuns,  about  one-quarter  of  the  total  in  Hungary,  were  deported. 
Authorities  banned  sixty-four  of  sixty-eight  functioning  religious 
newspapers  and  journals.  .Although  in  1950  the  Catholic  Church 
accepted  an  agreement  with  the  state  that  forced  church  officials 
to  take  a  loyalty  oath  to  the  Constitution,  relations  between  the 
church  and  the  state  remained  strained  throughout  the  decade. 

During  the  1960s,  the  two  sides  gradually  reached  an  accom- 
modation. In  1964  the  state  concluded  a  major  agreement  with  the 
Vatican,  the  first  of  its  kind  involving  a  communist  state.  The  docu- 
ment ratified  certain  episcopal  appointments  already  made  by  the 
church,  although  it  did  not  settle  Mindszenty' s  long-standing  case. 
As  before,  the  agreement  mandated  that  certain  individuals  in  po- 
sitions in  the  church  were  obliged  to  take  an  oath  of  allegiance  to 
the  Constitution  and  the  laws  of  the  country.  But  this  oath  was 
to  be  binding  only  to  the  extent  that  the  country's  laws  were  not 
in  opposition  to  the  tenets  of  the  Catholic  faith.  The  church  con- 
ceded the  state's  right  to  approve  selection  of  high  church  officials. 
Under  the  agreement,  the  Hungarian  Roman  Catholic  Church 
could  staff  its  Papal  Institute  in  Rome  with  priests  endorsed  by 
the  government,  and  each  year  even*  diocese  in  the  country  would 
send  a  priest  to  Rome  to  attend  the  institute.  For  its  part,  the 
government  promised  not  to  interfere  with  the  institute's  work. 

Following  the  agreement,  many  vacant  church  posts  were  filled. 
Gradually,  the  organizational  structure  of  the  church  was  reestab- 
lished, and  congregations  became  active  again.  The  church  began 
to  take  a  role  in  the  ceremonial  life  of  the  country.  Relations  be- 
tween church  and  state  warmed  particularly  after  1974.  when  the 
Vatican  removed  Mindszenty  from  his  office  (in  1971  Mindszenty 
had  received  permission  to  leave  the  country  after  spending  many 
years  in  the  American  embassy  in  Budapest,  where  he  had  fled 
to  escape  detention  by  the  authorities).  The  new  primate,  Laszlo 
Cardinal  Lekai.  who  held  office  from  1976  to  1986.  sponsored  a 
policy  of  "small  steps."  through  which  he  sought  to  reconcile  differ- 
ences between  church  and  state  and  enhance  relations  between  the 
two  through  "quiet,  peaceful  dialogue."  He  urged  Catholics  to 
be  loyal  citizens  of  the  state  and  simultaneously  to  seek  personal 
and  communal  salvation  through  the  church. 

Evidence  suggests  that  a  serious  falling  away  from  religion  among 
Catholics  (especially  a  drop  in  attendance  at  church  services)  oc- 
curred only  during  the  1960s  and  1970s,  ironically  during  the  period 


92 


when  the  government  no  longer  energetically  persecuted  the  church. 
Some  observers  have  suggested  that  in  the  1950s  the  church  earned 
popularity  as  an  anticommunist  institution  because  of  widespread 
dissatisfaction  with  material,  political,  and  cultural  trends  within 
the  country.  As  conditions  improved,  the  church  no  longer  served 
as  a  focal  point  for  the  disaffected.  Some  Catholics,  both  lay  and 
clerical,  felt  that  Lekai,  in  his  eagerness  to  smooth  relations  be- 
tween church  and  state,  went  too  far  in  compromising  the  church's 
position. 

The  Catholic  Church  of  the  1980s  had  difficulty  providing  ade- 
quate services  to  all  communities.  Its  clergymen  were  aging  and 
decreasing  in  number.  Whereas  in  1950  the  church  had  had  3,583 
priests  and  1 1 ,538  monks  and  nuns,  in  1986  it  had  only  about  2,600 
priests  and  a  mere  250  monks  and  nuns.  It  was  clear  by  this  time, 
however,  that  the  church  was  reaping  tangible  benefits  from  its 
relationship  with  the  state.  For  example,  in  the  1980s  the  Catholic 
orders  of  the  Benedictines,  the  Franciscans,  the  Piarists,  and  Our 
Lady's  School  Sisters  were  again  functioning  in  limited  numbers. 
A  new  order  of  nuns,  the  Sisters  of  Our  Lady  of  Hungary,  received 
permission  to  organize  in  1986.  In  the  1980s,  the  church  had  six 
seminaries  for  training  priests  and  a  theological  academy  in 
Budapest. 

After  the  communist  takeover,  the  historic  Protestant  churches 
became  even  more  thoroughly  integrated  into  the  new  state  system 


93 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

than  did  the  Catholic  Church.  They  were  not  a  source  of  organized 
dissent.  The  Reformed  (Calvinist),  Unitarian,  and  Lutheran 
churches  all  reached  accommodation  with  the  government  in  the 
late  1940s  (as  did  the  small  Greek  Orthodox  and  Jewish  commu- 
nities). These  agreements  guaranteed  the  Protestants  the  right  to 
worship  and  brought  about  some  financial  support  (contingent  after 
1949  on  the  loyalty  oath).  Some  Protestant  leaders  praised  the  agree- 
ments as  heralding  a  new  era  in  which  all  religions  would  be  treated 
equally.  However,  a  number  of  Reformed  clergy  and  followers  be- 
came active  supporters  of  the  Revolution  of  1956.  After  the  Revo- 
lution failed,  many  of  these  people  joined  "free  churches"  (including 
the  Baptist,  Methodist,  and  Seventh-Day  Adventist  churches), 
which  functioned  apart  from  the  historic  Protestant  churches. 

In  1986,  according  to  Western  estimates,  about  67.5  percent  of 
the  population  was  Roman  Catholic,  20  percent  was  Reformed 
(Calvinist),  5  percent  was  unaffiliated,  and  5  percent  was  Lutheran 
(its  members  were  in  particular  the  German  and  Slovak  minori- 
ties but  also  included  many  ethnic  Magyars).  Other  Christian 
denominations  included  Uniates,  Orthodox,  and  various  small  Pro- 
testant groups,  such  as  Baptists,  Methodists,  Seventh-Day  Adven- 
tists,  and  Mormons.  Most  of  these  smaller  groups  were  affiliated 
with  the  national  Council  of  Free  Churches  and  were  dubbed  free 
churches  as  a  group.  The  country  also  had  65,000  to  100,000  prac- 
ticing Jews.  The  remainder  of  the  population  did  not  subscribe  to 
any  religious  creed  or  organization.  Nor  was  any  single  church  or 
religion  particularly  associated  with  the  national  identity  in  the 
popular  mind,  as  was  the  Catholic  Church  in  Poland. 

Western  observers  concluded  that  although  the  country  possessed 
about  5  million  practicing  believers,  religion  did  not  provide  a  viable 
alternative  value  system  that  could  compete  with  the  predominant 
secularism  and  materialism  promoted  both  by  the  government  and 
by  trends  within  an  increasingly  modern  society.  Thus,  religion 
was  unlikely  to  become  a  vehicle  for  dissent  as  in  Poland  or,  in 
a  more  limited  way,  in  the  German  Democratic  Republic  (East 
Germany). 

A  noteworthy  phenomenon  of  the  early  1980s  was  the  appear- 
ance of  thousands  of  intensely  active  prayer  and  meditation  groups 
within  Catholic  and  Protestant  congregations.  Some  of  these  groups 
came  into  conflict  with  the  church  hierarchies  over  military  ser- 
vice and  other  aspects  of  cooperation  with  the  government  (see  Dis- 
sent and  Freedom  of  Expression,  this  ch.). 

The  Constitution  guarantees  freedom  of  conscience  and  religion. 
Until  1989,  however,  these  guarantees  were  severely  circumscribed

by  the  State  Office  for  Church  Affairs,  which  regulated  the  activi- 
ties of  the  churches.  On  June  15,  1989,  the  government  abolished 
this  office.  In  its  place,  the  government  planned  to  establish  a  "Na- 
tional Church  Council"  that  would  act  as  a  "consultative  organi- 
zation," not  as  an  instrument  for  the  control  of  the  churches.  In 
addition,  the  Ministry  of  Culture  assumed  responsibility  for  church 
affairs.  Also  in  1989,  the  government  submitted  for  public  debate 
new  "Principles  of  a  Law  on  Freedom  of  Conscience,  the  Right 
of  Free  Exercise  of  Religion,  and  Church  Affairs."  The  document, 
prepared  by  representatives  of  the  churches,  banned  discrimina- 
tion against  believers,  acknowledged  the  churches  as  legal  entities, 
and  recognized  their  equality  before  the  law.  Yet  in  the  late  1980s, 
the  state's  financial  support  of  all  major  churches  continued  to  give 
it  considerable  leverage  in  influencing  church  affairs. 

Between  1945  and  1986,  religious  communities  erected  or  re- 
paired 306  Roman  Catholic,  46  Calvinist  (Reformed),  33  Lutheran, 
and  23  Uniate  churches.  Congregations  of  the  free  churches  built 
185  new  structures,  and  the  Jewish  community  built  a  new  syna- 
gogue. The  various  denominations  maintained  their  own  modest 
publishing  organs  that  produced  newspapers,  periodicals,  and 
books.  Occasionally,  religious  services  were  broadcast  over  radio. 
The  various  churches  and  denominations  each  supported  (collec- 
tively, in  the  case  of  the  free  churches)  at  least  one  theological  acad- 
emy or  college  for  the  training  of  clergy.  However,  the  number 


95

of  students  was  small;  75  students  graduated  out  of  a  total  of  648 
students  enrolled  in  such  institutions  in  1987. 

Education 

Before  the  communist  assumption  of  power  in  1947,  religion  was 
the  primary  influence  on  education.  The  Roman  Catholic  Church 
sponsored  and  controlled  most  schools,  although  some  other  reli- 
gious denominations  (Reformed,  Lutheran,  and  Unitarian)  as  well 
as  the  government  ran  some  schools  (see  Religion  and  Religious 
Organizations,  this  ch.).  The  social  and  material  status  of  students 
strongly  influenced  the  type  and  extent  of  schooling  they  received. 
Education  above  the  elementary  level  was  generally  available  only 
to  the  social  elite  of  the  country.  In  secondary  and  higher-level 
schools,  a  mere  5  percent  of  the  students  came  from  worker  or 
peasant  families.  Only  about  1  or  2  percent  of  all  students  entered 
higher  education. 

Before  the  communist  educational  reforms,  secondary  education 
was  traditional.  The  curriculum  stressed  the  humanities,  often  at 
the  expense  of  the  sciences.  Technical  education  received  relatively 
little  attention,  despite  the  existence  of  technical  and  vocational 
schools. 

In  1946  the  government  established  the  principle  of  free  educa- 
tion as  a  right  of  all  citizens,  even  before  the  communist  assump- 
tion of  power.  In  1948  the  new  communist  government  secularized 
almost  all  schools  and  placed  them  under  state  control,  giving  over- 
sight to  the  Ministry  of  Education.  The  churches  retained  only  a 
few  institutions  to  train  their  clergy. 

The  Marxist-Leninist  government  made  major  changes  in  the 
education  system.  Its  goal  was  to  mold  citizens  to  work  for  the 
benefit  of  society.  The  reforms  stressed  technical  and  vocational 
training.  Political  education  also  became  a  high  priority.  Young 
people  were  to  receive  a  thoroughly  Marxist- Leninist  education 
both  within  and  outside  the  school  framework  (see  Ideology,  ch.  4). 
Education  also  sought  to  promote  a  thorough  understanding  of  the 
political  system,  an  understanding  fostered  also  by  youth  organi- 
zations functioning  outside  the  formal  educational  process.  Russian- 
language  study  became  compulsory  from  the  upper  levels  of  the 
general  school  (also  known  as  the  elementary  school)  through  the 
university.  Many  Soviet  professors  taught  at  Hungarian  universi- 
ties, many  textbooks  were  adaptations  of  the  work  of  Soviet  authors, 
and  Russian-language  clubs  were  established. 

Marxism-Leninism  had  become  the  backbone  of  the  curriculum 
by  the  early  1950s.  A  brief  period  of  liberalization  followed  the  death 
of  Soviet  dictator  Joseph  Stalin  in  1953  (see  Rakosi's  Rule,  ch.  1).

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


After  the  failure  of  the  Revolution  of  1956,  authorities  reverted 
to  their  former  emphasis  on  Marxist-Leninist  indoctrination. 
However,  they  did  modify  the  earlier  policy  of  Sovietization  in  favor 
of  a  more  Hungarian  orientation. 

The  regime's  ideology  also  dictated  the  need  to  increase  the  total 
number  of  students  enrolled  in  higher  education,  primarily  through 
recruitment  from  the  working  class  and  the  peasantry.  Whereas 
in  1939  only  13,000  students  were  enrolled  in  higher  education, 
by  1970  this  number  had  grown  to  86,000.  To  be  sure,  some  of 
these  students  were  participating  in  correspondence  or  evening 
courses  rather  than  regular  daytime  classwork.  Adults  were  en- 
couraged to  study  through  schools  at  the  workplace  and  correspon- 
dence courses.  Authorities  also  tried  to  expand  the  proportion  of 
students  from  lower  social  strata  by  setting  a  worker  and  peasant 
quota  of  about  60  percent  at  all  places  available  in  higher  educa- 
tion. Students  seeking  admission  to  these  institutions  were  assessed 
according  not  only  to  their  abilities  but  also  to  their  social  origins; 
the  children  of  families  belonging  to  the  formerly  privileged  classes 
rarely  were  given  the  opportunity  to  study.  When  students  from 
modest  socioeconomic  backgrounds  lacked  the  requisite  academic 
training,  one-year  remedial  courses  were  available  to  assist  them. 
In  1963  this  class-oriented  system  of  recruitment  was  abandoned. 
Nevertheless,  political  considerations  continued  to  play  a  role  in 
admissions  procedures  at  secondary  schools  and  universities. 

In  1986  the  country  had  3,540  elementary  schools,  587  secon- 
dary schools,  278  apprentice  schools,  and  54  institutions  of  higher 
education,  of  which  18  were  universities  with  several  faculties  and 
programs  extending  five  or  more  years.  Of  the  latter,  four  were 
general  universities,  three  were  technical  universities,  six  were 
agricultural  universities,  four  were  medical  universities,  and  one 
was  a  university  of  economics.  The  country  had  five  specialized 
university-level  institutes  for  the  arts  and  physical  education. 

Attendance  at  school  was  mandatory  from  age  six  to  sixteen.  All 
students  attended  general  schools  for  at  least  eight  years.  Tuition 
was  free  for  all  students  from  age  six  up  to  the  university  level. 
Most  students  actually  began  their  schooling  at  five  years  of  age; 
in  1986  approximately  92  percent  of  all  children  of  kindergarten 
age  attended  one  of  the  country's  4,804  kindergartens.  By  1980 
every  town  and  two-thirds  of  the  villages  had  kindergartens.  Par- 
ents paid  a  fee  for  preschool  services  that  was  based  on  income, 
but  such  institutions  were  heavily  subsidized  by  the  local  councils 
or  enterprises  that  sponsored  them. 

By  1980  only  29  percent  of  males  aged  fifteen  years  or  older  and 
38  percent  of  females  aged  fifteen  years  and  older  had  not  completed 


97 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


eight  years  of  general  school,  compared  with  78  percent  of  such 
males  and  80  percent  of  such  females  in  1949.  About  half  of  the 
students  who  completed  the  general  schools  subsequently  completed 
their  education  in  two  years,  through  vocational  and  technical  train- 
ing. The  remaining  students  continued  their  studies  in  a  four-year 
gymnasium  or  trade  school. 

In  1985  about  98,500  undergraduate  students  attended  the  coun- 
try's higher  educational  institutions.  Almost  10  percent  of  the  popu- 
lation aged  eighteen  to  twenty-two  was  enrolled  in  regular  daytime 
courses  at  institutions  of  higher  education.  In  the  1980s,  about  40 
percent  of  regular  students  came  from  worker  or  peasant  families. 
Most  of  these  students  either  were  exempt  from  tuition  payments 
or,  more  often,  received  financial  assistance.  In  the  1980s,  applicants 
outnumbered  places  available  in  the  colleges  and  universities.  As 
a  result,  many  persons  enrolled  in  evening  and  correspondence 
courses,  although  these  courses  were  not  considered  to  be  equal 
in  quality  to  regular  day  instruction. 

In  the  1985-86  academic  year,  about  2,500  foreign  students 
studied  full  time  in  Hungary.  About  half  were  European  students; 
the  remainder  came  from  developing  countries.  In  the  same  year, 
about  1,300  Hungarian  students  were  studying  in  foreign  institu- 
tions of  higher  education,  most  of  them  in  neighboring  countries. 

In  the  1980s,  the  average  educational  attainments  of  Hungar- 
ians ranked  in  the  middle,  in  comparison  with  those  of  citizens  of 
other  European  countries.  The  quality  of  Hungary's  education  sys- 
tem was  substantially  inferior  to  those  of  East  Germany,  Czecho- 
slovakia, and  Sweden  and  was  somewhat  lower  than  those  of 
Austria,  Belgium,  Finland,  Norway,  Poland,  and  West  Germany. 
Many  Hungarians  voiced  concerns  about  the  quality  of  their 
schools.  Critics  noted,  among  other  things,  that  although  Switzer- 
land spent  18.8  percent  of  its  national  budget  on  education,  Brazil 
18.4  percent,  and  Japan  19.2  percent,  Hungary  allotted  only  6.6 
percent  of  its  state  budget  to  education.  In  the  1980s,  the  country 
experienced  shortages  of  both  classrooms  and  teachers,  so  that 
primary- school  classes  sometimes  contained  up  to  forty  children. 
In  many  areas,  schools  had  alternate  morning  and  afternoon  school 
shifts  in  order  to  stretch  facilities  and  staff.  Moreover,  not  all 
teachers  received  proper  training. 

At  the  university  level,  in  the  late  1980s  some  students  and  faculty 
were  calling  for  greater  autonomy  for  institutions  of  higher  educa- 
tion and  were  demanding  freedom  from  ideological  control  by  both 
the  government  and  the  party.  They  decried  the  prominence  given 
to  the  study  of  Marxism-Leninism  and  the  Russian  language  in 
university  curricula.  The  public  was  also  distressed  over  the  fact 


98 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


that,  despite  the  government's  remedial  measures  during  previ- 
ous decades,  in  the  1980s  children  of  the  intelligentsia  had  a  far 
greater  chance  of  entering  institutions  of  higher  learning  than  did 
the  children  of  agricultural  workers  and  unskilled  industrial  workers. 

Health  and  Welfare 

After  the  communist  government  assumed  power  in  Hungary, 
it  devoted  much  attention  to  meeting  the  specific  health  care  and 
social  security  needs  of  the  population.  In  comparison  with  prewar 
standards,  the  average  citizen  received  far  better  health  care  and 
social  assistance  as  a  result  of  the  government's  policy.  Such  im- 
provements did  not  extend  to  housing;  like  other  countries  in 
Eastern  Europe,  Hungary  has  faced  a  severe  housing  shortage  since 
the  late  1940s.  However,  unlike  most  other  countries  in  Eastern 
Europe,  since  the  mid-1970s  the  government  has  encouraged 
citizens  to  build  their  own  housing.  This  policy  has  eased  the  short- 
age somewhat,  but  as  of  1989  the  lack  of  adequate  housing  remained 
a  serious  problem. 

Health 

The  modern  social  welfare  system  was  largely  a  product  of  the 
1970s  and  1980s,  although  setting  of  goals,  initial  planning,  and 
more  modest  coverage  for  citizens  began  in  previous  decades. 
Amendments  to  the  Constitution  in  1972  guaranteed  universal  as- 
sistance for  the  ill,  the  aged,  and  the  disabled.  The  Public  Health 
Act  of  1972  specifically  guaranteed  that  beginning  in  1975  all  per- 
sons would  have  free  medical  care  as  a  right  of  citizenship.  The 
Social  Insurance  Act  of  1975  provided  that  insurance  conditions 
and  benefits,  which  had  been  different  for  various  occupational 
groups,  become  uniformly  applied  to  all  citizens.  In  1982  even  those 
persons  involved  in  private  economic  activity  became  eligible  for 
full  social  insurance  coverage  (including  generous  sickness  and  dis- 
ability pay),  instead  of  being  limited  to  pension  and  accident 
coverage. 

The  social  welfare  system  expanded  steadily.  According  to  offi- 
cial statistics,  the  percentage  of  the  population's  income  represented 
by  social  benefits  in  cash  (including  social  insurance  payments)  and 
kind  (including  free  health  care)  was  17.4  percent  in  1960,  22.8 
percent  in  1970,  27.3  percent  in  1975,  and  32  percent  in  1980. 

The  state  health  care  system  was  highly  centralized.  Increasingly 
specialized  and  sophisticated  services  were  available  at  the  level 
of  the  district  (the  country  had  4,374  districts  in  1984),  municipal- 
ity, county,  region,  and  nation.  Each  district  had  a  designated  phy- 
sician to  whom  its  inhabitants  first  turned  for  care  under  the  public 


99 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

health  system.  If  an  ailing  person  required  a  specialist,  the  district 
physician  made  the  appropriate  referral.  In  the  1980s,  the  availa- 
bility of  physicians,  nurses,  and  hospital  beds  was  high  by  inter- 
national standards.  In  1986  the  country  had  31,154  physicians,  or 
about  one  physician  per  299  inhabitants  (up  from  one  physician 
per  909  inhabitants  in  1950,  one  per  637  inhabitants  in  1960,  one 
per  439  inhabitants  in  1970,  and  one  per  398  inhabitants  in  1974). 
The  country  had  100  hospital  beds  per  10,000  inhabitants  (up  from 
55.8  beds  per  10,000  inhabitants  in  1950,  71.1  in  1960,  and  85.5 
in  1974).  The  country  had  3,801  dentists  and  dental  surgeons, 
43,579  nurses,  57,277  other  health  personnel,  and  4,506  phar- 
macists. 

Although  by  the  1980s  about  99  percent  of  the  population  par- 
ticipated in  the  social  insurance  system  and  could  receive  free  med- 
ical services  and  hospital  care,  much  private  practice  was  allowed. 
In  1984  more  than  3,600  health  service  doctors  engaged  in  private 
practice,  treating  private  patients  during  their  free  time.  Many  of 
them  had  very  lucrative  private  practices.  Many  persons  in  upper- 
income  groups,  who  could  afford  the  high  price  of  private  medical 
care,  chose  to  use  the  services  of  a  private  physician  rather  than 
one  assigned  to  them  by  the  health  service.  Public  opinion  consi- 
dered the  care  given  by  private  physicians  to  be  of  higher  quality 
than  that  provided  by  the  health  service. 

In  the  1980s,  the  public  engaged  in  much  frank  and  apparently 
uncensored  discussion  about  serious  shortcomings  in  health  care. 
Complaints  concerned  the  aging  of  hospital  facilities,  the  disrepair 
of  their  equipment,  the  shortages  of  basic  medications,  and  the  in- 
adequate training  of  low-paid  medical  personnel.  Western  analysts 
estimated  that  Hungary  spent  only  3 . 3  percent  of  its  gross  national 
product  specifically  on  health  service  (the  6  percent  figure  listed 
in  most  statistical  data  actually  included  some  social  services).  This 
percentage  was  the  lowest  of  any  East  European  country  except 
Romania  (in  comparison,  the  United  States  spent  11  percent  of 
GNP  on  health  care).  Critics  judged  the  health  system  to  be  sub- 
standard, unreliable,  and  increasingly  tainted  by  the  practice  of 
offering  gratuities  to  medical  personnel  to  ensure  quality  care.  They 
warned  that  the  achievements  of  past  years  were  jeopardized  by 
the  current  neglect. 

Certain  trends  in  the  general  health  of  the  population  indeed 
gave  health  authorities  reason  for  concern  in  the  1980s.  Life  ex- 
pectancy at  birth  was  the  lowest  among  thirty-three  developed  coun- 
tries rated  by  the  World  Health  Organization.  In  1986  the  infant 
mortality  rate  was  19  per  1,000  live  births  (see  table  4,  Appen- 
dix). This  figure  showed  an  improvement  over  the  1970  rate  of 


100 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


35.9  per  1,000.  However,  the  infant  mortality  rate  remained  among 
the  highest  for  industrialized  countries  with  developed  health  sys- 
tems. In  1985,  according  to  Minister  of  Defense  Ferenc  Karpati, 
10  to  11  percent  of  young  males  were  unfit  for  military  service, 
and  another  4  to  5  percent  could  not  undergo  strenuous  physical 
training.  Among  conscripts  accepted  for  service,  3  to  4  percent  were 
discharged  before  the  end  of  their  training  for  health  reasons, 
primarily  because  of  physical  or  nervous  disorders. 

Health  authorities  had  other  special  concerns  less  directly  related 
to  the  health  care  system.  One  such  problem  was  the  country's  high 
suicide  rate.  In  the  mid-1980s,  the  suicide  rate  was  44  per  100,000 
inhabitants,  the  highest  suicide  rate  in  the  world.  (The  country  with 
the  second  highest  suicide  rate,  Austria,  reported  26.9  suicides  per 
100,000  inhabitants  in  1984.)  The  very  high  suicide  rate  had  a 
lengthy  history,  confirmed  by  statistics  dating  back  more  than  a 
century.  Since  the  late  1960s,  however,  the  rate  had  risen  notice- 
ably. Hungarian  experts  cited  as  factors  contributing  to  the  trou- 
bling situation  alcoholism,  mental  illness,  the  growing  number  of 
elderly  people,  the  disorienting  effect  of  urban  life,  stress,  and  the 
weakening  of  family  and  community  bonds  as  a  result  of  rapid 
modernization.  The  high  suicide  rate  among  people  over  age  sixty 
was  thought  to  result  from  the  economic  stagnation  and  inflation 
of  the  1980s,  which  made  it  difficult  for  people  to  subsist  on  small 
pensions. 

In  the  mid-1980s,  the  authorities  were  also  discussing  the  grow- 
ing incidence  of  substance  abuse.  The  incidence  of  alcoholism  had 
increased  during  the  previous  generation,  and  a  high  percentage 
of  suicide  victims  were  alcoholics.  As  of  1986,  consumption  of 
alcohol  per  person  per  year  was  11.7  liters;  consumption  of  hard 
liquor  (4.8  liters  per  person)  was  the  second  highest  in  the  world. 
Authorities  had  increased  the  price  of  hard  liquor  five  times  be- 
tween 1973  and  1986,  but  despite  these  measures,  excessive  alco- 
hol consumption  remained  a  problem.  Although  less  salient  than 
alcoholism,  drug  addiction  was  also  becoming  a  source  of  some 
concern  and  was  discussed  in  the  press.  Acquired  immune  defi- 
ciency syndrome  (AIDS),  a  serious  health  threat  associated  with 
drug  use  in  many  countries,  was  not  a  major  health  concern  in 
Hungary  in  the  late  1980s.  According  to  government  statistics 
released  in  early  1989,  the  first  AIDS  patient  entered  a  Budapest 
hospital  in  1985.  During  the  following  four  years,  the  country  had 
twelve  AIDS-related  deaths. 

In  the  1980s,  another  source  of  anxiety  for  both  health  authori- 
ties and  the  general  public  was  the  downward  trend  projected  for 
the  country's  population  (see  Structure,  this  ch.).  As  early  as  1973, 


101 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


concern  about  the  slowdown  in  population  growth  had  led  to  the 
introduction  of  a  comprehensive  population  policy.  Supplemental 
provisions  had  broadened  the  coverage  in  subsequent  years.  The 
policy  mandated  generous  pregnancy  and  maternity  allowances. 
Working  mothers  enjoyed  a  twenty- week  maternity  leave  with  full 
pay.  After  the  twenty  weeks  had  elapsed,  the  mother  could  receive 
an  allowance  to  enable  her  to  raise  the  child  at  home  until  it  reached 
the  age  of  three:  the  amount  of  the  allowance  varied  according  to 
the  number  of  children  and  amounted  to  about  25  to  40  percent 
of  national  average  earnings  per  month.  In  addition,  working 
mothers  had  access  to  unpaid  days  off  (prorated  according  to  the 
number  and  ages  of  the  children  involved)  or  other  benefits  to  enable 
them  to  take  care  of  a  sick  child.  Additional  ongoing  family  allow- 
ances were  available  for  families  with  two  or  more  children.  In  spite 
of  this  assistance,  child  rearing  was  a  large  expense  to  families.  The 
various  forms  of  assistance,  while  clearly  beneficial  to  young  fam- 
ilies, actually  amounted  to  only  15  to  20  percent  of  child-rearing 
costs. 

Welfare 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  country's  pension  system  covered  about 
85  percent  of  the  population  falling  within  pensionable  ages.  Male 
workers  could  qualify  for  pensions  at  the  age  of  sixty,  female  work- 
ers at  the  age  of  fifty-five.  The  number  of  pensioners  had  increased 
rapidly  since  the  end  of  World  War  II  as  people  lived  longer  and 
as  pension  coverage  expanded  to  include  additional  segments  of 
the  population.  In  the  early  1950s,  the  country  had  had  only  12 
to  13  pensioners  for  every  100  active  workers.  In  the  late  1980s, 
however,  the  country  had  50  pensioners  for  every  100  active  work- 
ers. This  trend  placed  a  heavy  burden  on  the  government,  the  main 
source  of  pension  funds. 

The  amount  of  a  person's  pension  depended  upon  earnings  and 
number  of  years  of  employment.  In  1989  the  minimum  monthly 
pension  was  3.340  forints  (about  US$54).  Yearly  cost-of-living  in- 
creases had  failed  to  keep  up  with  inflation.  In  1979  the  govern- 
ment introduced  major  pension  increases  for  the  lowest-paid 
pensioners  in  an  effort  to  improve  the  situation.  The  most  vulner- 
able pensioners  tended  to  be  women,  whose  pensions  averaged  25 
percent  less  than  men's  pensions.  More  women  had  small  pensions 
than  men  because  women  generally  had  worked  fewer  years. and 
earned  lower  salaries.  About  20  percent  of  all  pensioners,  or  about 
400.000  persons,  worked  to  bring  in  additional  income,  usually 
undertaking  part-time  or  seasonal  work.  In  the  1980s,  pension- 
ers constituted  a  significant  segment  of  the  country's  poor.  The

unfortunate  circumstances  of  many  elderly  citizens  and  the  need 
to  reform  the  pension  system  were  the  subjects  of  considerable  press 
commentary. 

Housing 

For  many  years,  the  housing  conditions  in  Hungary  were  only 
a  peripheral  concern  of  the  communist  regime.  The  housing  that 
existed  before  World  War  II  had  many  shortcomings.  Most  pre- 
war apartments  had  only  one  room  and  a  kitchen  area,  and  these 
facilities,  already  overcrowded  and  expensive,  had  been  heavily 
damaged  during  the  war.  In  1949  the  country  had  265  inhabitants 
for  every  100  rooms.  After  1949  the  government  confiscated  exist- 
ing housing  and  redistributed  it.  The  government  chose  not  to  invest 
heavily  in  housing,  although  many  buildings  were  reconstructed. 
The  new  regime  affirmed  the  right  of  all  inhabitants  to  decent  hous- 
ing, prohibited  evictions,  and  regulated  rents,  but  these  measures 
did  not  accelerate  construction.  During  the  early  years  of  communist 
rule,  economic  planning  gave  priority  to  the  building  of  new  plants 
and  other  industrial  installations  rather  than  to  new  housing.  Thus, 
construction  of  housing  did  not  keep  pace  with  urban  industrial 
expansion,  which  had  attracted  large  numbers  of  workers  from 
the  villages  into  the  cities.  Not  until  the  Fourth  Five- Year  Plan 
(1971-75)  did  the  housing  problem  receive  serious,  sustained 


103 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

attention.  Progress  then  became  more  rapid,  and  the  government 
experimented  with  various  approaches  to  the  problem.  Because  of 
budget  constraints,  the  government  abandoned  its  goal  of  provid- 
ing low-rent  apartments  for  all  citizens.  Instead,  it  urged  people 
to  invest  in  their  own  housing  and  made  available  low-interest  loans 
for  the  construction  of  cooperative  apartment  buildings  and  pri- 
vate homes.  This  policy  spurred  construction  and  helped  to  reduce 
the  overall  housing  shortage.  However,  most  new  housing  units 
were  built  for  the  higher-income  groups.  Families  with  lower  in- 
comes continued  to  rely  on  state-financed  or  industry-financed  low- 
rent  housing,  which  usually  had  long  waiting  lists  of  prospective 
tenants. 

In  the  1980s,  housing  remained  a  major  concern  for  families  at 
all  status  and  income  levels.  As  the  government's  direct  role  in 
providing  housing  diminished,  many  families  tried  to  use  any  sur- 
plus income  they  had  to  acquire  modern,  spacious,  well-equipped 
dwellings.  For  private  individuals  wishing  to  build  dwellings,  the 
most  important  resources  were  family  and  friends  (for  labor)  and 
loans  (usually  sponsored  by  the  government  at  3  percent  interest 
for  up  to  70  percent  of  the  total  construction  cost  and  repayable 
over  a  maximum  of  thirty-five  years).  As  of  1983,  only  about  22.3 
percent  of  the  country's  dwellings  were  state  owned,  down  from 
33.9  percent  in  the  first  half  of  the  1970s.  The  remaining  units  were 
privately  owned.  In  1986  approximately  69,430  dwellings  were  con- 
structed, 7,620  by  the  state  and  61 ,800  by  private  individuals  (the 
vast  majority  of  whom  received  some  state  funding).  However, 
despite  significant  gains,  housing  was  still  not  sufficient  for  the  coun- 
try's needs. 

Dissent  and  Freedom  of  Expression 

In  the  late  1980s,  numerous  signs  pointed  to  an  enlivening  of 
cultural  and  intellectual  life.  The  bounds  of  permissible  expression 
became  wider  as  authorities  eased  restrictions  on  artistic,  intellec- 
tual, and  political  expression. 

Until  the  mid-1980s,  outright  opposition  to  the  regime  and  its 
social,  political,  and  cultural  policies  was  undertaken  primarily  by 
intellectuals.  However,  the  relative  success  of  the  economy  after 
1968  made  it  difficult  for  dissidents  to  attract  broad  followings.  The 
working  class  was  politically  quiescent,  being  the  beneficiary  of  full 
employment  and  generous  welfare  provisions.  The  government's 
response  to  its  critics  was  to  acknowledge  their  existence  but  also 
to  stress  their  small  numbers  and  irrelevance.  Few  official  puni- 
tive actions  such  as  arrests  or  trials  took  place,  but  the  authorities 
did  use  low-level  police  harassment,  surveillance,  and  other  forms 


104 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


of  indirect  pressure.  Prominent  individuals  found  their  movements 
watched  and  occasionally  hindered  by  the  police.  Less  eminent  peo- 
ple sometimes  received  threats  to  their  jobs  and  careers.  Authori- 
ties denied  some  individuals  permission  to  travel  abroad  or,  at  the 
other  extreme,  urged  them  to  emigrate.  The  police  conducted  oc- 
casional house  searches  and  levied  fines  for  illicit  printing  or  dis- 
tribution of  unauthorized  publications  (samizdat).  Most  dissidents 
faced  only  sporadic  repression  but  also  minimal  public  response. 

In  addition  to  the  continuing  efforts  of  dissident  intellectuals, 
several  groups  of  protesters  pursued  specific  social  or  political  goals 
in  the  early  1980s.  The  law  did  not  recognize  conscientious  objec- 
tion and  prescribed  up  to  five  years'  imprisonment  as  punishment 
for  refusal  to  perform  military  service.  Beginning  in  1977,  however, 
members  of  certain  small  Christian  sects,  such  as  the  Nazarenes, 
Jehovah's  Witnesses,  and  Seventh-Day  Adventists,  were  allowed 
to  perform  unarmed  military  service  (see  Conscientious  Objection, 
ch.  5).  This  privilege  was  not  available  to  Roman  Catholics  and 
members  of  larger  Protestant  denominations,  whose  church  hier- 
archies had  a  history  of  supporting  the  establishment.  As  of  1986, 
Amnesty  International  reported  that  as  many  as  150  Hungarian 
conscientious  objectors  were  in  prison,  most  of  them  Jehovah's  Wit- 
nesses who  refused  to  perform  even  the  alternative  military  ser- 
vice available  to  them.  In  the  early  1980s,  an  independent  peace 
movement  of  significant  proportions  developed  (called  Peace  Group 
for  Dialogue,  or  Dialogus),  made  up  primarily  of  university  stu- 
dents and  recent  university  graduates.  Facing  official  hostility  and 
unable  to  initiate  a  dialogue  with  the  authorities,  the  organization 
disbanded  in  1983.  Its  members  and  other  persons  formed  other 
smaller  groups  and  engaged  in  small-scale  independent  activity. 
Under  pressure  from  the  authorities,  some  of  these  small  groups 
eventually  merged  with  the  officially  recognized  National  Peace 
Council. 

In  the  mid-1980s,  the  ecology,  or  "Green,"  movement  was  the 
largest  independent  movement.  Its  supporters  opposed  the  joint 
project  of  the  Czechoslovak  and  Hungarian  governments,  financed 
partially  by  the  Austrian  government,  to  build  the  Gabcikovo- 
Nagymaros  Dam  at  the  border  where  the  Danube  River  crosses 
from  Czechoslovakia  to  Hungary  (see  Relations  with  Other  Com- 
munist Neighbors,  ch.  4).  Demonstrations  attracted  as  many  as 
20,000  people.  Several  smaller  environmental  organizations  also 
engaged  in  small-scale  public  awareness  campaigns.  The  environ- 
mental groups  often  sought  to  maintain  distance  between  them- 
selves and  dissident  political  groups,  both  to  legitimize  their 
viewpoint  vis-a-vis  the  government  and  to  attract  wider  support.

Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


Environmentalists  were  very  cautious  in  their  response  to  the  1986 
accident  at  the  Chernobyl'  nuclear  power  plant  in  the  Soviet  Union, 
which  was  a  politically  sensitive  issue.  The  government  criticized 
independent  environmental  groups,  accusing  activists  of  pander- 
ing to  nationalist  sentiments  and  permitting  foreign  agitators  to 
intrude.  The  official  press  generally  ignored  the  activities  and  state- 
ments of  the  environmentalists.  Occasionally,  the  police  harassed 
their  leaders.  Nevertheless,  environmental  issues  appeared  to  be 
of  great  interest  to  the  public,  many  of  whom  signed  protest  peti- 
tions and  attended  meetings  in  significant  numbers. 

In  the  late  1980s,  opportunities  for  self-expression  expanded 
greatly  and  abruptly.  The  party  itself  was  planning  to  establish  a 
limited  multiparty  political  system  in  the  country  (see  Amendments 
of  1972,  ch.  4).  Increasingly,  party  members  acknowledged  pub- 
lic criticism  of  conditions  in  society  and  responded  to  them.  And 
in  the  late  1980s,  for  the  first  time  in  decades,  the  authorities  oc- 
casionally permitted  demonstrations  calling  for  changes  in  policy. 
However,  signals  sent  by  the  government  to  the  public  were  some- 
what mixed;  occasional  arrests  and  mistreatment  of  dissidents  con- 
tinued, and  police  broke  up  some  demonstrations.  In  the  late  1980s, 
individuals  began  testing  the  limits  of  the  government's  less  re- 
strictive approach.  The  system  of  informal  self-censorship,  which 
had  operated  since  the  1960s,  appeared  to  be  foundering  (see  Mass 
Media,  ch.  4).  Historians  called  for  archival  sources  on  the  na- 
tion's recent  history  to  be  opened  and  freely  examined  by  impar- 
tial scholars.  A  variety  of  independent  publishers  and  periodicals 
appeared,  dealing  with  sensitive  issues  or  publishing  the  works  of 
authors  previously  considered  taboo.  The  official  press  and  occa- 
sionally even  television  journalism  were  becoming  more  outspoken 
on  virtually  all  issues,  possibly  in  response  to  growing  competi- 
tion for  the  public's  attention. 

As  freedom  of  association  became  more  extensive  (a  more  per- 
missive law  was  officially  adopted  in  1989),  a  number  of  groups 
emerged  with  interests  spanning  the  entire  range  of  social  and  po- 
litical life.  The  focus  of  many  new  associations  revealed  a  growing 
popular  interest  in  public  affairs.  The  groups  ranged  in  outlook 
from  the  neo-Stalinist  Ferenc  Munnich  Society,  founded  in  1988, 
to  the  "Openness  Club,"  also  founded  in  1988,  which  sought  to 
promote  complete  freedom  of  the  press,  television,  and  radio. 

Some  groups  with  definite  political  leanings  hoped  eventually 
to  function  as  viable  political  parties.  Others  sought  merely  to 
represent  and  publicize  the  viewpoints  of  members.  Several  of  the 
latter  received  particular  attention  throughout  the  country.  In  Sep- 
tember 1987,  a  group  of  about  150  intellectuals,  including  some 


106 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


party  members,  formed  the  Hungarian  Democratic  Forum  to  spon- 
sor public  debates  on  social  and  political  policy.  At  first  the  regime 
seemed  to  welcome  the  Forum,  apparently  hoping  to  reap  the  sup- 
port of  previously  disaffected  intellectuals.  However,  the  Forum's 
status  later  became  less  clear,  as  some  of  the  participating  party 
members  were  expelled  from  the  party.  In  1988  a  group  of  stu- 
dents established  a  new  national  organization  called  the  Federa- 
tion of  Young  Democrats.  A  politically  radical  group,  it  aimed  to 
establish  a  democratic  Hungary,  but  its  leaders  denied  any  plans 
to  form  a  political  party.  In  1989,  together  with  five  other  organi- 
zations, the  Hungarian  Democratic  Forum  and  the  Federation  of 
Young  Democrats  formed  what  became  known  as  the  Opposition 
Roundtable  to  discuss  a  variety  of  social  and  political  policy  options. 

In  the  late  1980s,  more  than  at  any  time  in  the  previous  four 
decades,  the  Hungarian  people  lacked  a  consensus  on  the  proper 
social  goals  of  the  country.  Some  observers,  both  within  the  coun- 
try and  abroad,  feared  that  if  economic  conditions  worsened  as 
predicted,  latent  conflicts  among  social  groups  would  destabilize 
the  country,  especially  in  the  absence  of  strong  state  and  party  in- 
fluence, which  was  no  longer  considered  legitimate  in  the  eyes  of 
the  populace.  However,  other  observers  stressed  the  opportunities 
for  the  emergence  of  new,  fresh  ideas  and  the  vigorous,  healthy 
debates  that  were  occurring  throughout  Hungarian  society.  The 
latter  assessment  gave  genuine  grounds  for  optimism.

For  a  retrospective  view  of  aspects  of  society's  development, 
Zsuzsa  Ferge's  A  Society  in  the  Making  is  helpful.  Both  Hungarian 
and  Western  ethnographers  have  shown  special  interest  in  Hun- 
garian rural  life  and  its  modern  evolution.  Two  valuable  studies 
are  Edit  Fel's  and  Tamas  Hofer's  Proper  Peasants  and  Peter  D.  Bell's 
Peasants  in  Socialist  Transition.  Hungarian  Ethnography  and  Folklore  by 
Hungarian  ethnographers  Ivan  Balassa  and  Gyula  Ortutay  con- 
tains a  wealth  of  detail  as  well  as  illustrations  of  traditional  Hun- 
garian folkways.  For  the  current  urban  perspective,  Peter  A. 
Toma's  Socialist  Authority  provides  a  readable,  somewhat  journalistic 
overview.  The  Hungarian  government's  Central  Statistical  Office 
publishes  statistical  yearbooks  in  English  that  incorporate  much 
information  concerning  past  and  present  social  structure.  The  For- 
eign Broadcast  Information  Service's  Daily  Report:  East  Europe  offers 
current  reporting  of  major  social  developments  as  depicted  in  the 
Hungarian  media.  The  reports  published  by  Radio  Free  Europe 
contain  valuable  information  and  analyses  as  well.  (For  further  in-

Chapter  3.  The  Economy 


Large  kitchen  for  farm  workers'  meals,  1924 


DESPITE  WAR,  DEPRESSION,  revolution,  foreign  occupation, 
and  periods  of  near  chaos,  Hungary's  economy  has  advanced  in 
the  twentieth  century  from  a  near-feudal  state  to  a  middle-level 
stage  of  industrial  development.  The  economic  system  has  under- 
gone dramatic  change  since  1968,  evolving  from  a  Soviet-type 
"command"  economy,  in  which  government  planners  in  Budapest 
dictated  much  of  the  country's  economic  behavior,  into  a  hybrid 
that  combined  social  ownership  of  the  means  of  production  with 
a  stock  exchange,  central  planning  with  aspects  of  a  free  market, 
and  government  intervention  with  a  measure  of  enterprise  auton- 
omy and  some  private  enterprise.  After  Hungary's  failed  popular 
revolution  against  communist  rule  in  1956,  the  government  opted 
to  foster  domestic  tranquility  and  legitimize  control  by  the  Hun- 
garian Socialist  Workers'  Party  by  steadily  improving  the  Hun- 
garians' standard  of  living  through  economic  growth. 

For  several  reasons,  the  Hungarian  economy  can  grow  only  if 
its  factories  and  farms  become  more  efficient  and  competitive.  First, 
except  for  excess  workers  in  existing  enterprises,  Hungary  no  longer 
has  an  untapped  labor  pool,  such  as  the  one  that  existed  after  World 
War  II  in  the  female  and  peasant  populations.  Second,  the  coun- 
try has  a  paucity  of  natural  resources,  and  imports  of  raw  mate- 
rials have  become  more  costly  for  Hungary  on  both  Western  and 
Council  for  Mutual  Economic  Assistance  markets.  Third,  Hun- 
gary can  pay  for  imports  of  raw  materials  and  efficiency-improving 
Western  technology  only  by  exporting  goods  whose  quality  and 
price  are  competitive  in  the  world  market. 

Since  1968  the  government  has  launched  two  rounds  of  economic 
reform,  seeking  to  boost  efficiency  and  competitiveness.  The  first 
was  the  New  Economic  Mechanism,  introduced  in  1968,  in  which 
the  government  abolished  universal  compulsory  planning,  grant- 
ed enterprises  greater  autonomy,  and  unleashed  some  market  forces. 
The  program  stalled  within  four  years,  but  a  burgeoning  balance 
of  trade  deficit,  slumping  performance,  deteriorating  terms  of  trade, 
and  other  problems  prompted  the  leadership  to  start  the  reform 
process  anew  in  the  late  1970s.  Since  then  the  government  has 
streamlined  its  ministries,  dismantled  some  huge  enterprises  and 
trusts,  stimulated  the  growth  of  small  and  private  firms,  implement- 
ed a  competitive  pricing  system,  decentralized  foreign  trade,  created 
small  stock  and  bond  markets,  enacted  a  bankruptcy  law,  carried 


111 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

out  banking  reform,  and  levied  value-added  (see  Glossary)  and 
personal-income  taxes. 

In  the  late  1980s,  a  burdensome  foreign  debt,  inefficient  enter- 
prises, raw-material  supply  problems,  and  stiffer  competition  in  the 
world  market  were  just  a  few  of  the  problems  facing  the  economy. 
The  country's  leaders  had  to  improve  Hungary's  convertible- 
currency  trade  balance  significantly  in  order  to  import  the  tech- 
nology and  raw  materials  necessary  for  further  growth.  At  the  same 
time,  they  had  to  maintain  or  improve  domestic  living  standards 
and  hold  down  unemployment  and  domestic  inflation.  The  con- 
junction of  Soviet  leader  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev's  program  of  re- 
structuring in  the  Soviet  Union  and  Janos  Kadar's  replacement 
as  party  general  secretary  by  Karoly  Grosz  in  Hungary  greatly  en- 
hanced the  chances  that  the  government  would  try  to  achieve  further 
economic  progress  by  implementing  even  more  dramatic  reforms. 

Although  Western  observers  agreed  that  Hungary  had  the  most 
accurate  and  open  reporting  of  economic  statistics  in  the  communist 
world,  they  warned  against  accepting  those  data  at  face  value. 
Economists  in  communist  and  noncommunist  countries  used  differ- 
ent statistical  concepts  and  procedures  that  produced  differing 
images  of  Hungary's  economic  system.  Hungarian  and  foreign 
analysts  also  complained  that  political  expedience  had  sometimes 
tainted  Hungary's  official  statistics. 

Resource  Base 

Geologically,  Hungary  is  composed  primarily  of  young  sedimen- 
tary rock  that  is  generally  poor  in  minerals  and  other  raw  mate- 
rials except  bauxite,  soft  coal,  and  small  deposits  of  uranium,  natural 
gas,  oil,  iron  ore,  manganese,  and  copper.  However,  Hungary  has 
large  tracts  of  fertile  land,  a  favorable  climate,  and  some  forests. 
The  country's  general  lack  of  raw  materials  has  necessitated  for- 
eign trade,  a  concern  that  has  dominated  the  economic  policies  of 
Hungarian  governments  since  1918,  when  the  country  lost  much 
of  the  territory  it  held  prior  to  World  War  I  (see  Trianon  Hun- 
gary, ch.  1).  Raw  materials,  semifinished  products,  spare  parts, 
fuels,  and  electricity  accounted  for  64.2  percent  of  imports  in  1986 
and  cost  25.9  percent  of  Hungary's  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — 
see  Glossary).  The  Soviet  Union  was  Hungary's  principal  supplier 
of  raw  materials  (see  Foreign  Trade,  this  ch.). 

Energy  Resources 

In  the  late  1980s,  Hungary's  coal  deposits  totaled  about  4.5  bil- 
lion tons  and  included  hard  coal  (about  15  percent  of  the  total), 
brown  coal  (30  percent),  and  lignite  (55  percent).  Hungarian  coal 


112 


The  Economy 


generally  has  a  low  energy  content  and  lies  at  great  depths  in  thin 
seams,  making  mining  difficult  and  costly.  Deep  mines  in  the  Mecsek 
Mountains  near  Pecs  and  Komlo  yield  dusty  hard  coal  and  coal  suita- 
ble for  coking.  Thick  layers  of  higher-quality  brown  coal  lie  200  to 
300  meters  beneath  Tatabanya  and  Dorog,  while  lower-quality 
brown  coal  lies  under  the  Carpathian  foothills  near  Miskolc  and  in 
the  central  Danube  Plain.  The  Varpalota  Basin  in  Veszprem  County 
and  the  southern  slopes  of  the  Matra  Mountains  yield  lignite.  Hun- 
garian experts  predict  that  the  country's  coal  reserves  will  last  about 
400  years  at  the  production  levels  attained  in  the  late  1980s. 

Hungary's  natural-gas  and  oil  deposits  are  far  smaller  than  its 
coal  reserves.  The  country's  largest  natural-gas  deposits  are  located 
near  Szeged,  Hajduszoboszlo,  and  Miskolc.  Geologists  hoped  to 
discover  additional  natural- gas  deposits  but  predicted  that  natural- 
gas  reserves  would  run  dry  in  fifteen  to  twenty  years.  Small  crude- 
oil  deposits  lie  beneath  Szeged,  Zala  County,  and  other  areas.  The 
Zala  crude  is  highly  viscous  and  difficult  to  transport.  Wells  at 
Lispeszentadorjam,  Lovaszi,  and  other  sites  yield  high-quality  oil, 
but  in  the  late  1980s  the  deposits  were  almost  exhausted.  In  the  late 
1970s,  drillers  struck  oil  in  the  mid-Danube-Tisza  region  (the  cen- 
tral part  of  the  country)  and  near  Sarkeresztur,  Endrod,  and  Ulles. 
However,  geologists  anticipated  no  new  major  oil  discoveries  and 
expected  the  wells  to  run  dry  by  the  year  2000. 

In  the  1950s,  Hungary  began  mining  uranium  near  Pecs  with 
Soviet  assistance.  In  the  late  1980s,  estimates  of  the  actual  size  of 
the  country's  uranium  deposits  were  unavailable,  but  official  sources 
indicated  that  Hungary  had  uranium  reserves  sufficient  to  supply 
its  domestic  needs  until  about  the  year  2020.  In  the  mid-1980s, 
the  Soviet  Union  guaranteed  Hungary's  future  nuclear-fuel  needs. 

Mineral  Resources 

The  Bakony  and  Vertes  mountains  contain  10  to  12  percent  of 
the  world's  known  bauxite  reserves  and  deposits  of  manganese  ore, 
the  only  alloy  necessary  for  steel  production  found  in  Hungary. 
The  only  iron-ore  mine,  located  at  Rudabanya,  produces  ankerite 
and  siderite  that  contain  only  24  to  27  percent  iron  and  require 
lime  before  smelting.  In  the  late  1980s,  the  country's  limestone 
and  dolomite  reserves  satisfied  the  needs  of  its  pig-iron  industry. 
Copper  mines  at  Recsk  remained  undeveloped  in  1987  because  of 
lack  of  financing  and  because  of  copper's  low  price  on  world  com- 
modity markets. 

Land,  Climate,  and  Forests 

Arable  land,  pastures,  meadows,  vineyards,  and  gardens  occupy 
70  percent  of  the  total  land  area.  Hungary  has  large  tracts  of  fertile 


113 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

black  soil,  especially  in  the  Great  Plain  region;  although  the  cli- 
mate can  be  harsh,  it  is  favorable  for  agriculture  (see  Climate, 
ch.  2).  Concentrated  in  mountainous  areas,  the  forests  occupy  about 
1 . 5  million  hectares  and  contain  mostly  deciduous  trees  of  little 
value  except  for  holding  moisture.  The  government  launched  an 
extensive  reforestation  effort  after  World  War  II,  but  in  the  late 
1980s  domestic  timber  still  supplied  only  10  percent  of  the  coun- 
try's needs. 

Environmental  Problems 

Rapid  industrialization  and  the  priority  of  plan  fulfillment  over 
environmental  concerns  have  produced  serious  air  and  water  pol- 
lution problems  in  Hungary.  In  the  late  1980s,  about  38  percent 
of  Hungary's  population  lived  in  regions  where  air  pollution  ex- 
ceeded international  standards.  Electric  plants  burning  high- sulfur 
coal  and  automobiles  emitted  most  of  the  pollutants  that  fouled 
Hungary's  air.  The  country's  sulfur-dioxide  emissions  in  1984  to- 
taled 1.8  million  tons,  an  average  of  17.6  kilograms  per  hectare. 
Prevailing  winds  from  the  west  and  southwest  carried  70  percent 
of  Hungary's  sulfur-dioxide  emissions  into  neighboring  countries, 
but  acid  rain  had  damaged  25  to  30  percent  of  the  country's  forests. 
Government  efforts  had  succeeded  in  reducing  dust  pollution. 

Pollutants  also  fouled  the  rivers  and  ground  water.  The  Tisza, 
Danube,  Szamos,  Sajo,  and  Zagyva  were  Hungary's  most  polluted 
rivers,  and  the  water  supplies  of  773  towns  and  villages  were  not 
fit  for  human  consumption.  In  1970  Hungary  emitted  1.5  million 
cubic  meters  of  polluted  water  per  day.  Industrial  waste  from  chem- 
ical, rubber,  iron,  paper,  and  food-processing  industries  accounted 
for  70  percent  of  the  effluent,  of  which  only  27  percent  was  treated. 
Only  46  percent  of  Hungary's  population  had  an  adequate  sew- 
age system. 

In  the  1980s,  Hungary  annually  produced  5  million  tons  of 
hazardous  waste,  and  it  reportedly  imported  hazardous  waste  from 
Austria,  Switzerland,  and  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West 
Germany)  in  return  for  hard  currency.  After  three  years  of  public 
protest,  in  the  late  1980s  Hungary  began  constructing  an  inciner- 
ator in  Dorog  capable  of  burning  about  25,000  tons  of  hazardous 
waste  per  year.  Hungary  operated  a  nuclear- waste  dump  between 
the  villages  of  Kisnemedi  and  Piispokszilagy,  but  precise  informa- 
tion on  the  disposal  of  radioactive  waste  from  the  country's  nuclear 
power  plant  was  unavailable. 

Hungary  signed  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  Long-Range 
Transboundary  Air  Pollution  in  1979  and  the  Helsinki  protocol 


114 


The  Economy 


on  sulfur-dioxide  emissions  in  1985.  In  1987  and  1988,  the  govern- 
ment passed  new  pollution  regulations  and  obtained  loans  from 
the  World  Bank  (see  Glossary)  to  improve  pollution  control.  Hun- 
gary had  antipollution  agreements  with  Czechoslovakia  and  Aus- 
tria but  had  no  such  agreement  with  Romania  and  complained 
about  Romania's  chronic  discharge  of  phenol,  oil,  and  other  pol- 
lutants into  the  Tisza  and  smaller  rivers. 

Labor  Force 

In  the  late  1980s,  active  earners  made  up  a  large  percentage  of 
the  working-age  population,  and  many  Hungarians  supplemented 
their  income  by  working  outside  jobs,  tilling  household  plots,  or 
operating  private  businesses.  Unfortunately,  many  enterprises  used 
labor  inefficiently,  and  the  country  suffered  from  underemploy- 
ment and  relatively  low  labor  productivity.  The  government  had 
enacted  measures  aimed  at  forcing  enterprises  to  operate  more  ef- 
ficiently. Regrettably,  these  measures  threatened  the  elimination 
of  many  jobs  and  signaled  a  significant  ideological  departure  from 
communism's  commitment  to  full  employment.  Fear  of  unemploy- 
ment influenced  government  decisions  to  allow  the  private  sector 
to  grow  and  to  create  jobs  for  laid-off  workers.  Despite  the  govern- 
ment's concern,  observers  expected  overall  unemployment  to  re- 
main low  by  Western  standards. 

Work  Force 

In  1987  about  6.1  million  of  Hungary's  10.6  million  people  were 
of  working  age,  and  4.9  million  were  active  earners.  The  number 
of  active  earners  was  expected  to  remain  between  4.8  and  5.1  mil- 
lion in  the  1990s.  The  state  sector  employed  about  3.5  million  per- 
sons (70.5  percent  of  the  country's  active  earners)  in  1986;  the 
cooperative  sector,  approximately  1.2  million  (23.8  percent);  and 
the  private  sector,  about  266,000  (5.4  percent).  According  to  for- 
eign observers,  official  statistics  underestimated  the  size  of  the  pri- 
vate sector  because  they  included  only  persons  who  reported  their 
private  activity  as  their  primary  occupation.  In  the  late  1980s,  ap- 
proximately 75  percent  of  Hungary's  families  earned  extra  incomes 
working  "  sideline  activities"  to  supplement  the  wages  and  benefits 
that  family  members  earned  in  the  state  and  cooperative  sectors. 
These  activities,  which  were  mostly  agricultural,  generated  produc- 
tive man-hours  equal  to  about  20  percent  of  the  man-hours  worked 
each  year  in  the  socialist  sector  (the  state  and  cooperative  sectors) . 
While  sideline  activities  contributed  to  family  incomes  and  the  na- 
tion's productivity,  they  also  deprived  the  socialist  sector  of  the 


115 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

energy  and  attention  that  workers  would  otherwise  direct  to  their 
primary  jobs. 

In  1987  workers  in  industry  numbered  just  over  1.5  million,  or 
31.2  percent  of  the  active  earners,  including  57,600  in  the  private 
sector  (see  table  5,  Appendix).  When  rapid  industrialization  began 
in  1949,  only  19.4  percent  of  the  labor  force  worked  in  industry. 
Hungary  had  about  19.3  percent  of  its  labor  force  or  890,000  ac- 
tive earners  working  in  the  agricultural  sector  in  1987,  including 
about  846,100  in  the  socialist  sector  and  43,900  in  the  private  sec- 
tor. The  number  of  persons  actually  engaged  in  private  agricul- 
ture was  much  higher,  however,  because  government  statistics 
counted  collective-  and  state-farm  members  who  worked  house- 
hold plots  only  as  members  of  the  socialist  sector.  The  number  of 
workers  in  the  agricultural  sector  has  steadily  declined  since  the 
war.  In  1949  about  53.8  percent  of  the  labor  force  worked  in  agricul- 
ture; this  figure  dropped  to  24.4  percent  in  1970  and  to  19  percent 
in  1980,  but  it  rebounded  slightiy  to  19.3  in  1987  as  agricultural 
enterprises  began  employing  more  workers  in  nonagricultural  ac- 
tivities. The  service  sector  accounted  for  21 .3  percent  of  the  active 
work  force  in  1986;  commerce,  10.5  percent;  transportation  and 
telecommunications  employed  8.3  percent;  and  construction,  7 
percent. 

Underemployment  and  Unemployment 

After  World  War  II,  Hungary  suffered  from  chronic,  widespread 
underemployment.  Until  the  late  1980s,  the  leadership  stubbornly 
clung  to  the  principle  of  full  employment,  and  employment  rolls 
swelled  because,  as  a  consequence  of  low  wages,  it  was  more  cost 
effective  to  employ  human  labor  than  install  labor-saving  equip- 
ment or  implement  other  efficiency  measures.  In  addition,  an  en- 
terprise tax  based  on  average  wages  encouraged  managers  to  pad 
their  payrolls  with  low-paid,  redundant  employees  who  worked  at 
or  near  full  capacity  only  during  the  closing  weeks  of  a  plan  period 
when  pressure  to  meet  targets  was  most  intense.  Underemploy- 
ment combined  with  other  factors  to  make  the  country's  labor 
productivity  only  40  to  50  percent  of  that  in  Western  countries. 
In  the  late  1980s,  the  government  shelved  the  principle  of  full  em- 
ployment and  enacted  measures,  including  new  bankruptcy  and 
tax  laws,  to  induce  enterprises  to  use  labor  and  other  resources  more 
efficiendy  (see  Economic  Regulators,  this  ch.).  Vigorous  implemen- 
tation of  these  measures  will  entail  layoffs,  retraining,  and  early 
retirement  for  many  workers. 

Hungary  was  the  first  member  of  the  Council  for  Mutual  Eco- 
nomic Assistance  (Comecon — see  Glossary)  to  acknowledge  the 


116 


The  Economy 


existence  of  unemployment.  Marxist-Leninist  ideology  has  always 
considered  socialism  and  unemployment  incompatible,  and  until 
1987  even  the  word  unemployment  was  taboo  in  Hungary.  The  ideo- 
logical implications  of  this  policy  shift  outweighed  the  scale  of  the 
potential  layoffs.  The  government  reported  that  30,000  to  40,000 
people  were  unemployed  in  late  1987,  and  government  officials  have 
estimated  that  another  100,000  to  150,000  workers  might  be  laid 
off  while  Hungary  implemented  its  economic  reform.  Compared 
with  Western  countries,  however,  Hungary's  unemployment  prob- 
lem was  relatively  small:  a  4  percent  unemployment  rate  is  gener- 
ally considered  full  employment  in  a  free-market  economy;  in 
Hungary  this  percentage  would  amount  to  about  240,000  people. 

In  1987  Hungary  became  the  first  communist  state  to  establish 
public  works  programs  to  provide  jobs  for  the  unemployed.  In  1988 
it  created  an  unemployment  relief  fund  with  the  capacity  to  benefit 
25,000  people.  Nevertheless,  critics  argued  that  the  government 
did  not  allot  sufficient  funds  to  these  programs  to  deal  with  projected 
layoffs. 

Labor  Turnover 

Before  1968  the  labor  force  was  generally  tied  to  the  workplace. 
The  government  restricted  job  changes  and  prohibited  moving  to 
a  new  city  without  permission.  In  the  1980s,  however,  the  annual 
labor  turnover  rate  averaged  about  23  percent,  or  about  1  million 
job  changes  each  year,  mostly  in  low-paying,  seasonal,  and  un- 
skilled positions.  Although  the  government  had  lifted  legal  restric- 
tions, relocation  to  another  city  was  unusual  because  Hungary  had 
a  housing  shortage. 

Women  in  the  Work  Force  and  Foreign  Workers 

Women  joined  the  work  force  in  great  numbers  after  World  War 
II  and  contributed  significantly  to  the  government's  industrializa- 
tion drive  in  the  1950s  and  1960s.  Families  supported  the  entry 
of  women  into  the  work  force  because  they  could  not  survive  on 
a  single  income  or  they  desired  a  higher  living  standard.  In  1949 
about  29.2  percent  of  active  earners  were  women;  by  1987  they 
accounted  for  46  percent.  Likewise,  whereas  34.5  percent  of 
working-age  women  were  active  earners  in  1949,  about  75  per- 
cent were  active  earners  by  1987.  About  59  percent  of  Hungary's 
working  women  were  manual  workers;  the  remainder  worked  in 
white-collar  jobs.  (About  70  percent  of  men  were  manual  workers, 
and  30  percent  had  white-collar  jobs.)  Women  dominated  low- 
paying  jobs  in  the  textile  industry,  the  service  sector,  canneries, 


117 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

and  commerce;  in  the  white-collar  area,  women  dominated  in 
education,  health,  and  low-profile  office  jobs. 

Hungarian  enterprises  employed  about  10,000  foreign  workers 
in  1986,  including  about  3,000  Polish  miners,  1,300  Cubans  in 
various  jobs,  and  some  Vietnamese  textile  workers.  After  1983  Hun- 
garian workers  with  firm  job  offers  were  free  to  accept  employ- 
ment in  Western  countries  for  up  to  five  years,  but  in  1986  only 
a  small  number  of  Hungarians  were  employed  abroad. 

Economic  System  and  Control  Mechanisms 

In  the  late  1940s,  Hungary's  Marxist-Leninist  leaders  imposed 
a  Soviet- style  command  economy  that  included  rigid  central  plan- 
ning, agricultural  collectivization,  and  rapid  industrialization  (see 
Postwar  Hungary,  ch.  1).  Faced  with  the  need  to  improve  efficiency 
in  the  late  1960s,  however,  the  government  undertook  economic 
reforms  and  in  1968  introduced  the  New  Economic  Mechanism 
(NEM),  which  eliminated  compulsory  plan  directives,  introduced 
market  mechanisms,  allowed  many  enterprises  a  measure  of  au- 
tonomy, and  legalized  a  narrow  range  of  private  economic  activ- 
ity. The  reform  stalled  between  1972  and  1978,  but  trade  imbalances 
and  other  problems  prompted  the  government  in  1979  to  begin 
implementing  a  second  wave  of  reforms  that  included  ministerial 
and  industrial  restructuring.  These  reforms  to  a  great  degree 
differentiated  the  Hungarian  economy  from  a  traditional  command 
economy.  The  Hungarian  Socialist  Workers'  Party  (HSWP), 
however,  has  retained  its  monopoly  of  political  power,  and  a  cen- 
tral plan  containing  broad  goals  still  existed  in  1989.  After  Kadar's 
resignation  as  general  secretary  in  May  1988,  Hungary  entered 
a  new  era  that  may  see  more  energetic  implementation  of  reforms 
already  on  the  books  and  the  enactment  of  even  more  radical  re- 
form measures. 

Role  of  Party  and  Government  Bodies 

As  of  mid- 1989,  the  HSWP  was  the  dominant  political  institu- 
tion in  the  government  and  the  ultimate  authority  on  all  political, 
economic,  and  social  issues  (see  Hungarian  Socialist  Workers' 
Party,  ch.  4).  The  party's  leading  organs  passed  resolutions  that 
functioned  as  basic  guidelines  for  government  bodies  making  eco- 
nomic decisions,  and  party  leaders  also  exercised  formidable  in- 
formal influence.  Primary  authority  lay  with  the  Politburo  and  the 
Secretariat  (particularly  the  latter' s  committee  for  economic  and 
social  welfare  policy,  the  working  group  for  economics,  and  the 
department  for  economic  and  social  welfare  policy).  In  the  1980s, 
the  party  assumed  a  lower  profile  in  economic  decision  making  than 


118 


The  Economy 


it  had  before  the  reform,  and  it  consulted  more  with  ministers,  enter- 
prises, and  other  government  and  economic  organizations. 

The  Council  of  Ministers  was  the  government's  highest  admin- 
istrative decision-making  body.  Its  State  Planning  Committee 
concerned  itself  with  long-term  economic  issues.  The  council's  Eco- 
nomic Committee  oversaw  the  economy's  day-to-day  operation  (see 
State  Apparatus,  ch.  4). 

The  government  consolidated  the  ministerial  structure  in  the  late 
1970s  and  1980s  in  order  to  reduce  the  ministries'  influence  on 
managers  of  enterprises.  In  1989  four  branch  ministries — industry, 
agriculture  and  food,  construction,  and  communications — set  pol- 
icy, assisted  in  allocating  resources  (especially  investments),  promoted 
development,  and  ensured  achievement  of  export  targets.  Hungary's 
functional  ministries  were  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the  Minis- 
try of  Trade.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  supervised  the  banking  sys- 
tem and  worked  out  many  of  the  economic  regulators  that  guided 
the  economy.  The  Ministry  of  Trade  developed  and  implemented 
foreign  and  domestic  trade  policy,  granted  export  and  import  licenses 
and  certain  subsidies,  and  controlled  the  balance  of  payments. 

The  National  Planning  Authority  and  the  National  Price  Office 
acted  much  like  functional  ministries.  As  with  traditional  centrally 
planned  economies,  the  National  Planning  Authority  was  one  of 
the  most  powerful  economic  organs  in  the  government.  It  partici- 
pated in  almost  all  of  the  central  government's  economic  decision 
making,  and  its  chairman  presided  over  the  State  Planning  Com- 
mittee. After  the  NEM  was  instituted,  however,  the  planning 
authority  focused  primarily  on  medium-  and  long-term  planning. 
Prices  were  supposed  to  reflect  "justified"  costs,  and  enterprises  had 
to  report  price  increases  to  the  National  Price  Office,  which  could 
intervene  formally  or  informally  if  it  deemed  a  price  increase  un- 
justified. With  the  Council  of  Ministers'  approval,  the  National  Price 
Office  could  issue  administrative  commands  to  enterprises  in  case 
of  actual  or  possible  economic  disruptions.  However,  the  National 
Price  Office  usually  used  persuasion  or  adjusted  one  of  the  economic 
regulators  to  implement  its  decisions. 

In  the  late  1980s,  to  oversee  economic  policy  the  National  As- 
sembly had  committees  on  planning  and  finance,  industry,  agricul- 
ture, and  commerce  (see  National  Assembly,  ch.  4).  The  assembly's 
role  in  economic  policy  making  was  growing,  but  it  was  still  far 
less  important  than  its  Western  counterparts. 

Ownership 

The  means  of  production  consist  of  all  the  material  factors  used 
to  produce  goods  and  include  land,  raw  materials,  and  capital.  In 


119 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


a  traditional  centrally  planned  economy,  the  state  owns  all  the  sig- 
nificant means  of  production  outside  the  agricultural  sector.  The 
ruling  party  and  the  government  planning  bureaucracy  exercise 
the  functions  of  ownership  and  ration  the  means  of  production. 
In  the  agricultural  sector,  state,  cooperative,  and  private  forms  of 
ownership  coexist,  but  the  state  closely  supervises  and  controls  all 
key  aspects  of  production. 

In  Hungary  state  ownership  of  the  means  of  production  still 
predominated  in  the  late  1980s,  although  the  government  had 
broadened  the  scope  of  private  and  foreign  ownership.  The  state 
has  owned  more  than  90  percent  of  Hungary's  agricultural  land 
since  its  second  collectivization  campaign  ended  in  the  early  1960s. 
In  industry,  economic  reformers  wanted  the  state  to  delegate  owner- 
ship functions  to  enterprises  in  the  socialist  sector  or  to  indepen- 
dent holding  companies  whose  only  function  would  be  to  exercise 
ownership  rights.  (These  companies  would  operate  much  the  same 
way  that  incorporated  companies  in  capitalist  economies  operate.) 
Hungary  had  abolished  the  system  of  formal  central  allocation  of 
resources  for  all  but  a  few  goods,  and  enterprises  generally  had 
to  purchase  labor,  raw  materials,  and  other  inputs  to  production 
and  sell  output  on  their  own.  The  government  began  allowing  Hun- 
garian enterprises  to  form  joint  ventures  with  foreign  firms  in  1972. 
Subsequent  laws  made  joint  ventures  even  more  attractive  for  for- 
eign investors,  and  in  some  instances  foreign  firms  could  take  more 
than  a  50  percent  stake. 

Planning 

Under  capitalism  the  market  guides  most  economic  activity.  In 
a  traditional  command  economy,  however,  a  central  planning  board 
sits  atop  a  hierarchy  of  ministries,  branches,  and  enterprises  and 
attempts  to  direct  almost  all  economic  activity.  The  board  develops 
a  national  economic  plan  after  bargaining  with  ministries,  enter- 
prises, and  others  over  production  targets  and  resource  allocations. 
The  board  then  presents  the  plan  to  the  country's  highest  political 
authorities  for  approval.  The  plan  spells  out,  among  other  things, 
what  goods  will  be  produced,  who  will  produce  them,  how  much 
will  be  produced,  and  what  materials  and  capital  will  be  available. 
After  the  plan  is  approved,  the  planning  board  issues  directives 
to  ministries,  enterprises,  and  other  economic  institutions.  The 
directives,  which  have  the  force  of  law,  contain  production  targets 
expressed  in  physical  units  for  some  items  and  in  value  terms  for 
others.  Although  all  plan  targets  are  compulsory,  enforcement  is 
stricter  on  targets  for  higher-priority  items  such  as  military  hard- 
ware and  producer  goods. 


120 


The  Economy 


Under  the  NEM,  which  was  instituted  in  1968,  the  government 
abolished  compulsory  plan  directives  for  most  enterprises,  but  left 
its  planning  institutions  intact.  In  the  late  1980s,  the  plan  was  consid- 
ered a  framework  rather  than  a  law  binding  managers  of  enterprises, 
and  plans  often  stated  targets  as  ranges.  The  National  Planning 
Authority  developed  long-,  medium-,  and  short-term  plans.  Long- 
term  plans  reflected  the  leadership's  overall  economic  objectives  for 
national  income,  industrial  and  agricultural  production,  investment, 
and  other  areas.  The  government  used  short-  and  medium-term 
planning  to  guide  the  economy  toward  the  long-term  objectives. 

In  the  planning  process,  the  central  government  provided  each 
enterprise  with  information  about  forthcoming  plan  objectives,  and 
each  enterprise  in  turn  furnished  the  government  with  a  copy  of 
its  plan.  In  developing  short-  and  medium- term  plans,  the  National 
Planning  Authority  first  projected  supply  and  demand  using  enter- 
prise production  plans.  If  supply  and  demand  estimates  failed  to 
balance  or  if  enterprise  production  plans  did  not  comply  with 
broader  plan  goals,  the  authorities  could  manipulate  any  of  a  num- 
ber of  economic  regulators  in  order  to  induce  the  enterprises  to 
revise  their  production  plans.  For  example,  the  management  of 
each  state  and  collective  farm  had  to  prepare  a  five-year  plan  ac- 
cording to  instructions  from  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Food. 
The  ministry  then  aggregated  the  plans  of  all  the  farms.  If  the  sum 
of  the  plan  targets  indicated  that  the  agricultural  sector  could  not 
achieve  national  production  goals,  the  central  authorities  manipu- 
lated prices,  credits,  subsidies,  or  other  economic  regulators  to  in- 
duce farm  managers  to  alter  their  plans  toward  fulfilling  those  goals. 
The  party  and  government  supplemented  these  economic  regula- 
tors with  direct  intervention  to  ensure  plan  fulfillment  in  such  key 
areas  as  defense  and  energy  production,  extractive  industries,  con- 
struction of  key  infrastructure  projects,  and  foreign  trade. 

Economic  Regulators 

Instead  of  issuing  compulsory  plan  targets,  the  government  ad- 
ministratively adjusted  economic  regulators  to  induce  enterprises 
and  cooperatives  to  fulfill  the  regime's  macroeconomic  plan.  The 
key  economic  regulators  were  prices,  taxes,  enterprise-income  regu- 
lations, exchange  rates,  and  direct  administrative  intervention.  The 
government  did  not  apply  the  regulators  uniformly  throughout  the 
economy  but  changed  them  according  to  need. 

Prices 

In  a  traditional  command  economy,  prices  function  as  political 
instruments  rather  than  as  natural  market  regulators  that  respond 


121 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

to  supply  and  demand.  Central  authorities  set  producer  and  con- 
sumer prices,  which  bear  little  relationship  to  each  other  and  often 
remain  fixed  for  many  years.  Producer  prices  are  those  prices  that 
enterprises  pay  for  goods.  Planners  use  producer  prices  to  facili- 
tate target- setting  and  to  determine  plan  fulfillment.  Consumer 
prices  for  all  items  except  housing,  foodstuffs,  and  other  basic 
necessities  are  set  at  artificially  high  levels  to  avoid  open  inflation. 
Consumer  prices  for  essential  goods  are  supposed  to  be  set  at 
market-clearing  levels,  but  actual  retail  prices  are  often  lower,  caus- 
ing persistent  shortages  and  forced  savings.  Prices  for  imports  and 
exports  are  based  on  current  world  market  prices  in  trade  with  the 
West  and  on  an  average  of  past  world  market  prices  for  trade  with 
the  Comecon  countries. 

In  1968  the  NEM  gave  enterprises  more  flexibility  to  set  prices 
and  permitted  market  forces  to  influence  prices.  Subsequent  price 
reforms  created  a  direct  link  between  world  market  prices  and  Hun- 
garian producer  prices  for  most  items.  The  government,  however, 
could  not  allow  prices  to  float  freely  because  key  enterprises  faced 
little  domestic  or  import  competition  and  could  dictate  the  prices 
of  essential  items  in  an  unrestricted  market.  Decades  of  arbitrary 
price,  wage,  tax,  and  subsidy  policies  also  have  left  many  imbalances 
in  the  economy  that  would  cause  significant  dislocations  if  the 
authorities  arbitrarily  introduced  a  free  market  in  one  stroke. 

In  1980  the  authorities  introduced  a  so-called  "competitive  price 
system"  for  industrial  producer  prices.  The  system  was  designed 
to  simulate  what  domestic  prices  would  be  if  enterprises  faced  sig- 
nificant market  competition.  The  government  assigned  each  enter- 
prise to  one  of  three  groups  according  to  a  series  of  factors,  including 
the  amount  of  competition  the  enterprise  faced  in  the  domestic  and 
foreign  market.  The  different  groups  were  subject  to  progressively 
less  restrictive  pricing  rules;  enterprises  facing  the  stiffest  compe- 
tition were  generally  subject  to  the  least  restrictive  rules.  A  1984 
reform  gradually  loosened  administrative  restrictions  in  order  to 
permit  market  forces  to  guide  the  pricing  decisions  of  a  greater  num- 
ber of  enterprises.  In  agriculture,  the  government  set  producer 
prices  annually  according  to  average  production  costs  and  other 
factors,  and  it  used  cost-plus  pricing  for  most  other  sectors. 

The  NEM  left  consumer  prices  virtually  untouched,  and  by  1976 
the  average  of  consumer  prices  had  fallen  below  the  average  of 
producer  prices.  The  authorities  subsequently  adjusted  consumer 
prices  in  order  to  manage  demand,  wean  enterprises  away  from 
reliance  on  government  subsidies,  and  reestablish  a  buffer  between 
producer  and  consumer  prices.  Over  the  course  of  the  1980s,  the 


122 


The  Economy 


government  attempted  to  let  market  forces  influence  a  growing 
number  of  consumer  prices. 

Wages,  Salaries,  and  Incentives 

In  a  traditional  command  economy,  the  government  regulates 
each  enterprise's  wage  fund  and  fixes  wage  scales  for  workers  in 
different  job  classifications.  Managers  receive  bonuses  based  on 
their  ability  to  fulfill  plan  targets.  The  government  regulates  farm- 
ers' incomes  by  establishing  prices  for  deliveries  to  the  state;  some 
farmers  legally  supplement  their  earnings  by  selling  produce  grown 
on  private  plots. 

In  the  late  1980s,  labor  income  was  composed  of  wages,  salaries, 
and  profit-sharing  payments.  In  addition  to  levying  taxes,  the  gov- 
ernment regulated  wages  and  salaries  by  setting  basic  pay  brack- 
ets depending  on  skill  classifications  and  working  conditions.  For 
unskilled  job  categories,  the  highest-paid  workers  made  50  percent 
more  than  the  lowest-paid  workers;  for  skilled  categories,  the 
highest-paid  workers  made  100  percent  more  than  the  lowest-paid 
workers  in  the  same  category.  Other  regulations  governed  profit- 
sharing  distributions.  The  government  used  these  income  regula- 
tors to  counterbalance  forces  that  tended  to  force  incomes  up  and 
thus  create  inflationary  pressures  and  widen  income  differentials. 
These  forces  resulted  from  the  enterprises'  monopoly  over  the 
domestic  market  and  enterprise  managers'  insufficient  economic 
interest  in  profitability.  Wage  increases  and  profit-sharing  payments 
have  been  linked  to  enterprise  profits  since  1968,  and  in  1985  the 
government  introduced  a  radical  reform  of  wage  and  income  rules 
that  abandoned  the  practice  of  controlling  incomes  with  a  check 
on  average  wages. 

Taxes 

In  a  command  economy,  the  state  collects  taxes  and  other  charges 
from  enterprises,  collectives,  cooperatives,  and  individuals  and 
redistributes  the  revenue  to  fund  public  consumption,  new  invest- 
ment, and  subsidies  for  enterprises  unable  to  cover  costs.  In  the 
late  1980s,  Hungary's  tax  system  was  very  complex.  Few  tax  rules 
applied  uniformly  to  all  enterprises;  some  tax  scales  were  custom- 
fit  for  individual  enterprises,  sometimes  even  within  the  same 
branch,  and  the  government  often  granted  one-time  tax  exemp- 
tions to  financially  strapped  enterprises.  In  1988  Hungary  became 
the  first  communist  country  to  introduce  value-added  and  personal- 
income  taxes.  The  government  originally  intended  to  use  these  new 
taxes  to  supplant  capital,  accumulation,  wage,  and  local  taxes  on 
enterprises,  but  it  did  not  abolish  all  of  the  existing  taxes. 


123 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

The  1988  tax  law  for  the  first  time  required  state  enterprises, 
private  businesses,  and  individuals  to  account  for  all  business  trans- 
actions. The  government  introduced  the  value-added  tax  in  order 
to  switch  its  revenue  source  from  the  enterprises  to  consumers;  to 
increase  labor  expenses  in  order  to  improve  labor  efficiency;  to  in- 
crease prices  and  enable  the  government  to  reduce  state  subsidies; 
to  raise  import,  raw-material,  and  energy  prices  to  encourage  their 
efficient  utilization;  and  to  enhance  incentives  for  export  produc- 
tion. The  government  levied  the  personal  income  tax  in  order  to 
minimize  net  income  differentials  in  the  state,  cooperative,  and  pri- 
vate sectors;  to  stifle  the  growth  of  the  underground  economy;  to 
tap  previously  unreported  private  income;  and  to  create  a  means 
to  adjust  taxes  for  inflation.  The  levying  of  a  personal-income  tax 
was  also  intended  to  help  eliminate  other  kinds  of  taxes  that  im- 
peded productivity. 

Enterprise  Income  Regulation 

In  addition  to  price  and  wage  regulation  and  taxation,  the  Hun- 
garian government  controlled  enterprise  incomes  by  prescribing 
the  means  by  which  enterprises  calculated  revenues  and  expenses 
and  apportioned  earnings.  Taxes  on  inputs  and  profits  were  levied 
at  several  steps  in  the  sequence  of  computations.  In  1985  the 
authorities  abolished  rules  requiring  enterprises  to  allocate  after- 
tax profits  to  various  wage  and  development  funds,  but  in  the  late 
1980s  the  government  still  used  tax  rules  and  other  devices  to  in- 
fluence enterprise  distribution  of  after-tax  profits. 

Exchange-Rate  Controls 

In  1981  Hungary  established  a  unified  exchange  rate  and  be- 
came the  first  Comecon  country  to  permit  limited  convertibility 
of  its  currency.  At  the  same  time,  the  Hungarian  National  Bank 
began  adjusting  the  exchange  rate  of  the  forint  (for  value  of  the 
forint — see  Glossary)  on  a  daily  basis  against  a  weighted  basket 
of  nonconvertible  currencies,  using  a  variety  of  criteria  including 
export  and  domestic  producer  prices.  The  exchange  rate  functioned 
as  a  domestic  price-setting  guide  that  to  a  certain  degree  reflected 
world  market  prices. 

Direct  Administrative  Intervention 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  government  reserved  the  right  to  inter- 
vene directly  in  sectors  marked  by  a  significant  market  imbalance 
and  when  manipulation  of  economic  regulators  proved  insufficient 
to  achieve  or  restore  a  state  of  equilibrium.  The  government  also 
could  intervene  directly  when  a  Comecon  agreement  had  to  be 


124 


The  Economy 


fulfilled.  Means  of  direct  government  intervention  included  allocat- 
ing resources;  adjusting  imports,  exports,  or  purchases  by  producers 
and  distributors;  forcing  enterprises  to  accept  contracts  to  supply, 
for  example,  important  investment  projects,  the  health  care  sys- 
tem, state  reserves,  and  other  areas;  designating  distribution  chan- 
nels; and  prescribing  inventory  levels.  Each  year  the  government 
decided  which  enterprises  were  subject  to  central  intervention,  and 
a  list  of  these  enterprises  became  a  part  of  the  annual  plan.  In  the 
late  1980s,  government  recourse  to  central  allocation  or  adminis- 
trative intervention  had  become  an  exception  to  the  rule,  and  when 
such  intervention  did  take  place,  it  was  in  a  number  of  cases  only 
temporary. 

Finance 

In  a  centrally  planned  economy,  an  enterprise  has  three  sources 
of  finance:  the  state  budget,  the  banks,  and  the  enterprise's  own 
resources.  An  enterprise  cannot,  however,  use  its  after-tax  profits 
to  increase  wages  or  to  undertake  new  investment  without  govern- 
ment approval.  Credit  is  necessary  to  provide  enterprises  with  the 
financial  means  needed  to  pay  for  planned  inventories  and  to  finance 
operations  during  the  hiatus  between  delivery  and  payment;  credit 
also  gives  the  government  an  additional  means  of  controlling  enter- 
prise activity.  A  single  bank  performs  both  central  and  commer- 
cial banking  functions. 

The  reforms  of  the  mid-  to  late  1980s  significantly  altered  Hun- 
gary's financial  institutions  and  practices.  A  number  of  new  banks 
were  created,  and  the  government  permitted  foreign  investors  to 
participate  in  the  banking  system.  The  credit  system  was  liberal- 
ized, although  decisions  to  extend  credit  remained  unrelated  to  past 
economic  performance.  The  government  also  created  a  series  of 
new  investment  opportunities  for  individuals  and  enterprises.  Fi- 
nally, in  1986  Hungary  enacted  a  bankruptcy  law. 

Financial  Institutions 

The  economic  reforms  of  the  mid-  to  late  1980s  resulted  in  a 
restructuring  of  the  country's  financial  institutions.  Up  until  that 
time  the  institutions  included  the  Ministry  of  Finance;  the  Hun- 
garian National  Bank;  five  major  and  several  smaller  commercial 
banks,  some  with  foreign  partners;  the  National  Savings  Bank;  small 
venture-capital  institutions;  and  a  nascent  insurance  industry. 

The  Ministry  of  Finance  oversaw  the  financial  and  banking  sys- 
tem and  the  insurance  industry.  The  ministry  also  supervised 
foreign-exchange  policy  and  concluded  international  financial  agree- 
ments through  the  Hungarian  National  Bank. 


125 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


In  1987  Hungary  unveiled  a  new,  two-tier  banking  system  con- 
sisting of  banks  that  were  supposed  to  function  as  genuine,  profit- 
making  credit  institutions.  Before  the  reform,  the  Hungarian 
National  Bank  dominated  the  banking  system,  functioning  as  the 
central  bank,  the  bank  of  issue,  and  the  main  commercial  bank. 
All  banks  acted  as  agents  of  the  state,  and  their  lending  decisions 
were  based  not  on  profitability  but  on  government  guidelines  geared 
toward  implementing  the  economic  five-year  plan. 

The  1987  reform  stripped  the  Hungarian  National  Bank  of  its 
commercial-banking  function,  but  it  remained  the  country's  bank 
of  issue  and  its  central  bank.  In  its  role  as  the  bank  of  issue,  the 
Hungarian  National  Bank  established  the  national  payment  and 
accounting  system,  promulgated  rules  on  money  circulation,  coor- 
dinated Hungary's  relations  with  international  financial  institu- 
tions, and  determined  foreign-exchange  rates.  As  the  central  bank, 
the  Hungarian  National  Bank  regulated  the  money  supply  using 
credit  policy,  interest  rates,  obligatory  reserve  requirements,  and 
other  means.  The  Hungarian  National  Bank  was  a  member  of  the 
International  Bank  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  the  International 
Investment  Bank,  both  headquartered  in  Moscow.  It  was  also  a 
shareholder  in  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements  in  Basel, 
Switzerland,  and  owned  the  Hungarian  International  Bank  in  Brit- 
ain and  the  Central  Wechsel-  und  Creditbank  A.G.  in  Austria. 

The  reform  created  five  major  commercial  banks:  the  Hungar- 
ian Foreign  Trade  Bank,  the  General  Banking  and  Trust  Com- 
pany, the  Hungarian  Credit  Bank,  the  National  Commercial  and 
Credit  Bank,  and  the  Credit  Bank  of  Budapest.  They  were  all 
Hungarian-owned  joint-stock  companies  and  were  licensed  to  per- 
form a  full  range  of  commercial-banking  services  and  provide  short- 
term  credits  for  technical-development  projects  and  the  implemen- 
tation of  new  technology.  The  government  did  not  permit  these 
banks  to  establish  direct  foreign  banking  relations,  however,  or  to 
offer  banking  services  to  individuals.  The  Hungarian  Foreign  Trade 
Bank  handled  foreign-currency  exchange,  countertrade,  letters  of 
credit,  and  industrial  cooperation  deals.  In  addition,  it  provided 
short-term  import  and  export  credits  and  loans  for  projects  geared 
toward  expanding  exports.  Eleven  smaller  financial  institutions  also 
offered  commercial-banking  services. 

Hungary  has  joined  with  foreign  investors  to  form  several  other 
commercial  banks.  The  Central-European  International  Bank 
(CIB),  which  had  US$436  million  in  assets  in  1986,  performed  lease 
financing  and  prefinancing  of  export  contracts.  Founded  in  1979, 
CIB  was  the  first  offshore  bank  (a  bank  set  up  in  a  foreign  country 
to  take  advantage  of  the  particular  regulatory  environment  of  that 


126 


The  Economy 


country)  in  a  Comecon  country  and  the  first  joint  venture  in  Hun- 
gary in  which  Western  partners  took  a  majority  stake.  The  Hun- 
garian National  Bank  held  a  34-percent  share,  and  six  Western  banks 
each  held  11 -percent  shares.  Another  commercial  bank,  Citibank 
Budapest,  was  a  joint  venture  of  Citibank  Overseas  Investment  Cor- 
poration and  the  Central  Wechsel-  und  Creditbank  A.G.  Citibank 
Budapest  was  the  first  Western  bank  permitted  to  take  direct  part 
in  commercial  banking  activities  in  Hungary.  It  was  a  full-service 
commercial  bank  that  operated  in  forints  and  convertible  curren- 
cies. Unicbank  was  a  third  commercial  bank  offering  equity  financing 
for  new  and  expanding  ventures  and  short-,  medium-,  and  long- 
term  loans  to  state-owned  enterprises,  cooperatives,  joint  ventures, 
and  private  businesses.  Six  Hungarian  financial  institutions  and 
cooperative  banks  from  Austria  and  West  Germany  joined  with  the 
International  Finance  Corporation,  a  subsidiary  of  the  World  Bank, 
to  form  Unicbank  in  1987. 

Other  than  local  savings  cooperatives,  Hungary's  National  Sav- 
ings Bank  was  the  only  financial  institution  permitted  to  serve  in- 
dividuals in  the  late  1980s.  The  National  Savings  Bank  handled 
savings  accounts,  made  loans  to  individuals  and  private  businesses, 
and  engaged  in  foreign  currency  exchanges  through  a  countrywide 
network  of  branches.  The  bank  also  handled  convertible-currency 
accounts  for  Westerners,  offering  competitive  interest  rates  and  pro- 
tection from  Western  tax  authorities.  Other  small  venture-capital 
institutions  allowed  by  a  1982  government  decree  provided  either 
credit  or  equity  to  new  businesses  engaged  in  innovation,  techni- 
cal development,  and  the  like,  that  the  traditional  financial  insti- 
tutions were  not  equipped  or  inclined  to  finance. 

In  addition  to  these  financial  institutions,  in  the  late  1980s  Hun- 
gary had  two  separate  insurance  companies.  Spurred  by  rising  in- 
flation in  Hungary,  the  insurance  companies  had  become  strong 
advocates  of  further  economic  reform,  especially  the  broadening 
of  laws  on  equity  investment.  One  of  the  companies  made  direct 
investments  in  a  private  hotel  and  a  brewery  and  planned  to  in- 
vest in  the  construction  of  office  buildings. 

Credit  Criteria 

After  several  rounds  of  reform,  credit  decisions  often  remained 
unrelated  to  the  past  profitability  or  creditworthiness  of  the  poten- 
tial borrower,  and  the  government  often  used  the  credit  system  to 
bail  out  enterprises  operating  at  a  loss.  In  cooperation  with  other 
banks  and  financial  institutions,  the  Hungarian  National  Bank  is- 
sued "Guiding  Principles  on  Credit  Policy"  as  part  of  the  state 
five-year  plan.  Credits  were  extended  under  varying  conditions, 


127 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

with  different  interest  rates,  maturities,  and  priorities  to  influence 
development  in  harmony  with  the  national  plan.  The  directives 
of  the  Hungarian  National  Bank  were  binding  on  all  other  parts 
of  the  banking  system. 

Financial  Instruments 

Before  reforms  were  enacted  in  1 983 ,  enterprises  had  no  options 
other  than  depositing  their  after-tax  profits  in  bank  accounts  or 
investing  them  in  their  own  operations,  and  individuals  had  no 
options  other  than  maintaining  savings  accounts  or  investing  in 
housing  or  real  estate.  In  1989  enterprises  could  deposit  funds  at 
a  number  of  banks;  invest  in  their  own  plants;  lend  money  to  other 
enterprises  through  inter-enterprise  loans;  and  buy,  issue,  and  trade 
stocks  and  bonds.  Individuals  could  invest  their  funds  in  a  savings 
bank,  purchase  bonds,  lend  money  to  other  individuals,  or  invest 
in  silent  partnerships.  The  government  hoped  the  development  of 
these  new  investment  opportunities  would  boost  enterprise-profit 
and  personal-income  incentives,  encourage  voluntary  savings  by 
enterprises  and  the  population,  funnel  more  capital  to  efficient  enter- 
prises and  more  productive  endeavors,  and  conversely  reduce  the 
capital  flow  to  inefficient  enterprises  and  wasteful  projects.  In  1989 
it  was  still  uncertain  whether  these  reforms  would  produce  the 
desired  effects. 

The  government  allowed  agricultural  cooperatives  to  issue  up 
to  200,000  forints  (approximately  US$3,225)  in  bonds  to  mem- 
bers as  well  as  nonmembers  beginning  in  1984,  and  the  authori- 
ties later  expanded  the  right  to  issue  bonds  to  industrial  and  other 
enterprises.  In  1987  enterprises  issued  bonds  worth  about  US$354 
million,  up  from  US$87.3  million  the  year  before.  Bond  issuance 
accounted  for  about  7  percent  of  total  private  savings  and  about 
10  percent  of  total  investment.  By  early  1988,  banks,  enterprises, 
local  councils,  agricultural  and  industrial  cooperatives,  hospitals, 
and  other  entities  had  issued  about  US$500  million  in  bonds.  About 
100,000  individuals  owned  60  percent  of  the  bonds;  institutions 
held  the  remainder.  Returns  ranged  from  9  to  12  percent  and  were 
higher  than  the  interest  paid  on  savings  accounts.  The  government 
taxed  interest  on  bonds  issued  after  January  1,  1988,  at  a  flat  rate 
of  20  percent. 

In  early  1987,  the  government  legalized  the  capitalization  of 
enterprises  through  the  sale  of  stock  without  prior  authorization. 
By  early  1988,  investors  had  purchased  about  US$555  million  worth 
of  stock  in  sixteen  banks  and  about  fifty  enterprises  and  joint  ven- 
tures. In  the  same  year,  about  twenty  financial  and  banking  insti- 
tutions founded  a  small  stock  exchange.  The  exchange  opened  for 


128 


The  Economy 


trading  only  once  every  two  weeks,  but  its  founders  hoped  to  ex- 
pand its  operation  and  introduce  a  fully  computerized  trading  sys- 
tem. Trading  was  limited  because  the  government,  through  the 
Hungarian  National  Bank,  owned  most  of  the  shares.  By  1989  at 
least  one  enterprise  had  launched  an  employee  stock  ownership  plan, 
and  the  government  had  proposed  a  law  lifting  existing  restrictions 
on  employee  stockholding  in  order  to  tap  uninvested  individual  sav- 
ings and  give  employees  a  sense  of  common  purpose  with  their 
enterprises.  The  opening  of  stock  and  bond  markets  prompted 
former  Ministry  of  Finance  employees  to  create  a  private  company 
to  perform  independent  assessments  of  individual  enterprises. 

Bankruptcy 

In  1986  Hungary  became  the  first  communist  country  to  enact 
a  bankruptcy  law.  The  law  sought  to  induce  enterprises  to  become 
profitable  and  less  reliant  on  state  subsidies,  which  in  1987  con- 
sumed about  23  percent  of  the  national  budget.  Under  the  law, 
creditors,  unpaid  suppliers,  and  other  enterprises  could  initiate 
bankruptcy  proceedings  against  any  insolvent  or  delinquent  enter- 
prise except  agricultural  collectives.  The  National  Reorganization 
and  Liquidation  Board,  which  oversaw  the  bankruptcy  process, 
attempted  arbitration  and  reorganization  before  final  liquidation. 
Workers  who  lost  their  jobs  as  a  result  of  liquidation  were  entitled 
to  unemployment  benefits. 

Although  by  1987  claimants  had  filed  bankruptcy  actions  against 
fifty-five  enterprises,  including  one  large  construction  firm,  the 
government  had  not  enforced  the  bankruptcy  law  vigorously. 
Government  interference  in  the  market  remained  so  widespread 
that  in  bankruptcy  proceedings  unprofitable  enterprises  could 
justifiably  argue  that  their  losses  were  only  marginally  related  to 
efficiency  or  managerial  decisions.  Despite  proclamations  that 
profitability  was  the  main  standard  for  judging  enterprise  perfor- 
mance, the  government  continued  to  compensate  firms  operating 
at  a  loss  with  subsidies,  tax  breaks,  credits,  preferential  treatment 
in  price  setting,  and  other  means.  The  government  extracted  the 
earnings  of  profit-making  enterprises  to  fund  these  measures. 

Industrial  Organization 

In  a  centrally  planned  economy,  only  branch  ministries  and  other 
government  bodies  can  establish  production  and  distribution  enter- 
prises, which  are  usually  very  large  and  have  a  regional  or  nation- 
wide monopoly  in  their  business  activity.  Enterprises  carry  on 
official  economic  relations  through  the  ministerial  bureaucracy 


129

rather  than  through  a  market.  State  organs  appoint,  evaluate, 
promote,  and  dismiss  enterprise  managers,  whose  main  responsi- 
bility is  to  meet  or  exceed  plan  targets. 

Industrial  organization  in  Hungary  followed  the  pattern  of  a 
command  economy  until  1968,  when  the  government  granted  en- 
terprises a  modicum  of  autonomy.  Reform  advocates  were  not, 
however,  powerful  enough  to  force  a  restructuring  of  Hungary's 
industrial  institutions.  In  the  late  1970s,  Hungary  had  the  world's 
most  concentrated  industrial  organization,  with  699  state  enter- 
prises employing  an  average  of  1 ,569  people  each.  The  bureaucracy 
functioned  in  many  ways  as  it  did  before  the  reform,  supervising 
and  directing  large  enterprises  and  trusts,  thus  stifling  the  develop- 
ment of  true  enterprise  autonomy  and  a  market  mechanism. 

On  several  occasions  in  the  1980s,  the  government  adopted  mea- 
sures to  decentralize  Hungary's  highly  concentrated  industrial  or- 
ganization in  order  to  promote  enterprise  independence,  flexibility, 
and  efficiency.  In  1981  the  authorities  eased  restrictions  on  creat- 
ing small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  in  the  state,  collective, 
and  private  sectors.  The  government  merged  three  industrial  minis- 
tries into  the  single  Ministry  of  Industry  in  order  to  shrink  the  bu- 
reaucracy and  cut  the  informal  channels  of  influence  that  existed 
between  the  ministries  and  supposedly  independent  enterprises. 
Between  1979  and  1984,  the  authorities  broke  up  14  of  the  coun- 
try's 28  trusts  and  divided  a  number  of  large  enterprises  into  more 
than  300  smaller  entities.  However,  despite  the  government's  ef- 
forts, Hungary's  industrial  organization  remained  one  of  the  world's 
most  highly  concentrated.  This  concentration  led  to  the  creation 
of  monopolies  that  suffocated  competition  in  many  production  areas . 
In  the  late  1980s,  the  central  government  also  continued  to  expect 
the  Ministry  of  Industry  to  ensure  supplies,  and  both  the  govern- 
ment and  the  enterprises  continued  to  expect  the  ministry  to  in- 
tervene to  remedy  imbalances. 

Also  in  the  1980s,  the  government  took  steps  to  simplify  the  com- 
plicated and  time-consuming  process  of  starting  a  business.  A 
minister,  the  head  of  a  nationwide  government  body,  or  a  local 
council  with  prior  approval  from  the  minister  of  finance  could  found 
a  state-owned  enterprise.  The  founder  defined  the  enterprise's  in- 
itial activity  and  supervised  its  operation,  but  other  changes  have 
eroded  much  of  the  control  that  founders  once  exercised.  In  1985 
most  of  Hungary's  industrial  enterprises  introduced  "democratic 
measures,"  under  which  the  employees  elected  top  managers  di- 
rectly or  indirectly.  The  government  also  permitted  enterprises  to 
change  their  economic  activities  without  prior  consultation, 
provided  that  they  informed  their  founder  and  the  appropriate 


130 


The  Economy 


branch  ministry  of  the  change.  Enterprise  councils  or  collective 
management  were  managing  77  percent  of  the  industrial  enterprises 
by  1986,  while  the  Ministry  of  Industry  continued  to  supervise  the 
remainder.  Even  under  "industrial  democracy,"  an  enterprise's 
founder  could  veto  candidates  for  director  and  dismiss  elected  direc- 
tors, and  ministries  still  exercised  critical  influence.  As  Janos 
Kornai,  a  leading  Hungarian  economist,  has  written,  despite  "in- 
dustrial democracy"  and  the  authorities'  call  for  profitability  and 
attention  to  the  market,  enterprise  managers  know  that  their 
"career,  the  firm's  life  and  death,  taxes,  subsidies  and  credit,  prices 
and  wages,  all  financial  'regulators'  affecting  the  firm's  prosper- 
ity, depend  more  on  the  higher  authorities  than  on  market  per- 
formance." 

In  1982  the  government  provided  for  the  creation  of  semiprivate 
and  private  industrial  ventures,  including  economic  work  cooper- 
atives (EWCs)  and  independent  contract  work  associations 
(ICWAs),  to  encourage  entrepreneurship  and  competition.  EWCs 
were  groups  of  no  more  than  thirty  workers  employed  by  a  state- 
owned  enterprise  who  were  allowed  to  use  the  enterprise's  ma- 
chinery outside  normal  working  hours  to  produce  goods  under 
special  contracts.  The  workers  needed  the  enterprise's  permission 
to  establish  an  EWC,  and  the  enterprise  often  entered  into  con- 
tracts with  the  EWC  itself.  The  workers  received  far  higher  wages 
for  this  additional  work  than  they  did  for  their  regular  jobs.  In  1982 
approximately  25,000  workers  participated  in  2,775  EWCs;  by  the 
end  of  1986,  approximately  450,000  workers  participated  in  35,205 
EWCs.  ICWAs  were  self-organized  and  self-capitalized  private 
groups  that  performed  work  under  contract  but  had  no  affiliation 
to  any  single  state-owned  enterprise.  About  half  of  an  ICWA's 
members  worked  for  the  group  full  time.  In  1982  Hungary  had 
2,341  ICWAs;  by  October  1983,  that  number  had  climbed  to  4,463. 

Agricultural  Organization 

In  a  traditional  centrally  planned  economy,  state  and  collective 
farms  play  the  key  role  in  agricultural  production;  small  private- 
plot  farming  is  tolerated  but  is  expected  to  "wither  away."  The 
state  makes  production  and  marketing  decisions  for  the  farms,  and 
individual  state-farm  managers  and  collective-farm  members  have 
little  input  into  decision  making. 

Hungary  collectivized  its  agricultural  sector  in  two  campaigns 
beginning  in  1949  and  ending  in  1961.  In  the  first  campaign,  the 
government  coerced  peasants  to  move  to  state  and  collective  farms, 
enforced  compulsory  delivery  quotas  and  high  taxes,  and  set  prices 
artificially  low  to  gain  control  of  agriculture  and  use  it  to  generate 


131 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

capital  needed  for  industrial  development  (see  Rakosi's  Rule,  ch.  1). 
Peasants  reacted  by  slowing  production  and  departing  from  the 
collective  farms  in  great  numbers,  especially  during  the  Revolu- 
tion of  1956  (see  Revolution  of  1956,  ch.  1).  The  government 
changed  its  tactics  in  the  second  campaign,  which  began  in  the  late 
1950s.  The  authorities  relied  more  on  persuasion  than  coercion  and 
eliminated  compulsory  deliveries,  increased  material  incentives, 
furnished  loans,  offered  tax  breaks,  and  provided  seed,  fertilizers, 
and  farm  equipment.  By  1960  about  90  percent  of  Hungary's  farm- 
land was  collectivized,  and  in  1961  nearly  94  percent  of  the  agricul- 
tural earners  worked  in  the  socialist  sector. 

After  the  mid-1960s,  the  agricultural  sector  often  served  as  a  testing 
ground  for  reforms  later  introduced  into  the  overall  economic  sys- 
tem. In  the  1965-67  period,  the  government  eliminated  obligatory 
plan  targets,  allowed  farms  to  plan  production,  loosened  restrictions 
on  self- financing,  and  permitted  production  on  private  plots.  After 
the  NEM  was  introduced  in  1968,  cooperative  farms  gained  true 
autonomy.  In  the  1980s,  agricultural  producers  could  buy  inputs 
from  a  variety  of  sources  and  sell  to  purchasers  of  their  choice. 

Large-Scale  Farming 

Large-scale  farming — made  up  of  state  and  cooperative  farms — 
focused  on  such  activities  as  grain  and  fodder  production,  which 
were  capital-intensive  and  in  which  economies  of  scale  were  most 
significant.  A  1985  law  transformed  state  farms  from  state- 
administered  organizations  into  self-governing  enterprises  under 
the  supervision  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Food.  However, 
state  farms  were  subject  to  more  state  control  than  cooperatives 
in  such  matters  as  appointment  of  managers  and  the  use  of  profits, 
and  state-farm  employees  were  government  employees  who  worked 
for  fixed  wages  and  bonuses. 

A  cooperative  farm  was  owned  and  managed  by  its  members, 
who  elected  a  chairman  to  manage  the  farm  according  to  its  charter. 
Although  cooperative  farms  could  employ  workers,  cooperative 
members  were  technically  not  "employees."  The  cooperative  paid 
employees  a  set  wage;  members  received  a  base  salary  and  a  year- 
end  dividend  based  on  net  profits.  Cooperatives  were  also  freer 
than  state  farms  in  deciding  how  to  use  their  profits,  and  many 
cooperatives  delegated  certain  operations  to  autonomous  work  teams 
or  individuals  who  divided  the  operation's  net  profits.  The  cooper- 
ative farms  owned  only  about  half  the  land  they  worked;  the  state 
and  individuals  owned  the  rest. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  government  still  fixed  prices  for  a  large 
portion  of  agricultural  production,  including  corn,  wheat,  and  beef 


132

cattle.  In  addition,  all  state  and  cooperative  farms  received  some 
form  of  state  subsidy,  and  about  27  percent  received  fixed-rate  sub- 
sidies for  farming  low-quality  land.  Hungary's  large-scale  farm- 
ing sector  has  become  increasingly  concentrated  as  state  and 
cooperative  farms  have  merged.  Between  1960  and  1986,  the  num- 
ber of  agricultural  cooperatives  dropped  by  72  percent  to  1,260. 
The  amount  of  arable  land  per  cooperative  stood  at  3,024  hectares 
in  1986. 

Small-Scale  Farming 

Small-scale  producers — individuals  or  small  groups  who  tilled 
household  plots  or  operated  small  farms — concentrated  more  on 
labor-intensive  output  or  activities  in  which  the  risks  of  investment 
were  to  be  assumed  by  those  doing  the  work.  In  the  late  1980s, 
Hungary  had  three  types  of  small-scale  farming  units:  approxi- 
mately 623,000  household  plots  of  cooperative  members,  about 
792,000  small  auxiliary  farms  of  nonagricultural  or  state-farm  em- 
ployees, and  a  few  private  farms.  Approximately  63  percent  of  the 
population  participated  in  the  small-scale  agriculture  sector.  The 
combined  contribution  of  household  plots  and  auxiliary  and  pri- 
vate farms  to  gross  agricultural  output  was  31.5  percent  in  1975 


133 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


and  31.3  percent  in  1986.  Successful  integration  of  small-scale  farm- 
ing into  the  agricultural  sector  kept  overall  production  levels  high. 

The  government  imposed  few  restrictions  on  the  sale  of  output 
in  the  small-scale  farming  sector,  and  supply  and  demand  deter- 
mined prices  in  a  free  market.  Thus,  producers  had  a  strong  in- 
centive to  work  hard  and  produce  more.  Before  the  mid-1980s, 
cooperatives  were  hostile  to  household  producers.  In  the  late  1980s, 
however,  officials  proclaimed  that  private  household  farming  was 
a  permanent  component  of  agriculture  under  socialism.  The  cen- 
tral government  encouraged  cooperatives  to  assist  members  with 
household  plots  to  boost  production  by  providing  seed,  transport, 
machinery,  advice,  and  marketing  assistance.  Household  producers 
also  qualified  for  subsidies,  tax  breaks,  loans,  and  discount  prices 
for  machinery  and  agricultural  chemicals.  Regulations  limited 
the  size  of  household  plots  to  0.6  hectares  of  cropland  and  0.23 
hectares  of  vineyard  or  orchard  per  worker.  The  government  aban- 
doned earlier  limits  on  livestock.  Pensioners,  housewives,  depen- 
dents, and  others  performed  most  of  the  work  on  household  plots 
and  small-scale  farms.  Their  labor  amounted  to  about  2.3  billion 
man-hours  annually  and  outstripped  the  total  number  of  man-hours 
worked  in  large-scale  farming. 

A  ncillary  A  c  tivities 

The  1 968  reform  allowed  agricultural  enterprises  to  diversify  into 
nonagricultural  economic  activities.  Twenty  years  later,  the  govern- 
ment granted  cooperatives  the  right  to  change  their  internal  struc- 
ture, to  engage  in  new  activities,  and  to  extend  their  involvement 
in  nonagricultural  production  without  the  permission  of  regulato- 
ry bodies.  State  farms  and  cooperatives  were  engaged  in  food 
processing,  machinery  repair,  parts  production  for  manufactur- 
ing enterprises,  construction,  trade,  and  the  restaurant  business. 
Several  large-scale  farms  developed  "technically  operated  produc- 
tion systems"  for  crop  production,  horticulture,  and  animal  hus- 
bandry that  used  state-of-the-art  technology.  The  farms  sold  these 
systems,  which  included  input  and  output  programs  and  consult- 
ing services,  to  other  large-scale  farms.  These  systems  have  acceler- 
ated the  modernization  of  the  agricultural  sector. 

The  nonagricultural  activities  of  state  and  cooperative  farms  have 
increased  profits  and  tapped  manpower  once  lost  during  off-seasons. 
In  1983  nonagricultural  activities  accounted  for  47  percent  of  state- 
farm  profits  and  44  percent  of  cooperative-farm  profits.  By  1988 
the  farms'  ancillary  activities  accounted  for  more  than  7  percent 
of  Hungary's  total  industrial  production.

The  Economy 


Private  Activity 

Perhaps  the  most  significant  aspect  of  the  economic  reform  and 
the  leadership's  most  striking  break  with  Marxist-Leninist  ideology 
has  been  the  expansion  of  the  private  sector.  The  government  de- 
cided to  allow  the  emergence  of  private  enterprise  because  it  be- 
lieved that  private  entrepreneurs  would  increase  competition  in 
some  areas,  fill  demand  for  goods  and  services  that  state-owned 
enterprises  had  been  unable  or  unwilling  to  meet,  and  create  work 
for  people  who  would  lose  their  jobs  as  unprofitable  enterprises  re- 
organized to  become  more  efficient.  Changes  in  the  Domestic  Trade 
Law  in  1986  opened  new  areas  to  private  entrepreneurs,  especially 
in  services.  A  year  later,  the  government  allowed  private  businesses 
in  a  number  of  categories  to  employ  twenty  to  thirty  workers.  A 
law  passed  in  1988  allowed  the  establishment  of  limited  partnerships, 
which  could  include  an  unlimited  number  of  partners  and  employees 
and  operate  in  all  fields  except  finance.  However,  private  business- 
es continued  to  suffer  from  restricted  access  to  capital  from  state- 
owned  banks  and  thus  had  to  depend  on  private  and  extralegal  loans 
that  did  not  carry  full  legal  protection. 

Small  lamily-operated  businesses  remained  the  rule  in  the  pri- 
vate sector,  and  in  1987  only  about  300  private  businesses  employed 
more  than  six  people.  Most  entrepreneurs  ran  their  businesses  as 
a  part-time  activity  in  order  to  supplement  their  earnings  from  a 
job  in  the  state  sector  that  provided  social  benefits.  In  addition  to 
the  household  plots,  private  farms,  economic  work  cooperatives, 
and  independent  contract  work  associations,  private  business  people 
were  operating  28,965  retail  shops,  restaurants,  and  other  busi- 
nesses in  1986,  more  than  twice  the  total  in  1980.  In  addition  to 
private  restaurants  and  stores,  which  accounted  for  about  7  per- 
cent of  domestic  trade  in  1985,  entrepreneurs  had  established 
computer-software  companies,  construction  firms,  service  busi- 
nesses, and  a  theater.  Individuals  could  also  contract  to  operate 
state-  or  cooperative-owned  retail  stores  or  restaurants  and  retain 
all  profits  over  the  contract  cost.  In  1986  contractors  operated  about 
12  percent  of  Hungary's  shops  and  41  percent  of  its  food-service 
establishments. 

Conflict-Resolution  Mechanisms 

In  countries  with  a  command  economy,  the  ruling  communist 
party  generally  denies  the  existence  of  antagonistic  conflicts  that 
arise  between  groups  with  differing  economic  interests.  The  leader- 
ship suppresses  open  expression  of  these  conflicts  and  resolves  them 
behind  closed  doors.  When  authorities  reform  such  an  economic 


135 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

system  by  introducing  market  mechanisms,  they  acknowledge  that 
economic,  and  therefore  political,  conflict  arises  between  various 
groups  and  that  the  authorities  must  devise  political  mechanisms 
to  resolve  them.  The  market  mechanism  resolves  certain  conflicts, 
such  as  disputes  between  buyers  and  sellers  or  creditors  and  bor- 
rowers, but  new  conflict-resolution  mechanisms  are  necessary  to 
resolve  broader  conflicts. 

As  of  the  late  1980s,  the  Hungarian  leadership  had  chosen  to 
tackle  this  problem  by  implementing  conflict-resolution  devices  that 
did  not  threaten  the  HSWP's  monopoly  of  power.  The  govern- 
ment introduced  electoral  reform,  granted  the  judiciary  greater  in- 
dependence to  administer  justice  according  to  legal  criteria,  and 
encouraged  trade  unions  to  become  more  active  in  defending  the 
interests  of  the  workers  against  enterprise  managers  (see  State  Ap- 
paratus, ch.  4).  Trade  unions  obtained  the  right  to  call  strikes  when 
management  decisions  disregarded  the  law  or  breached  a  collec- 
tive contract  or  "socialist  morality";  however,  the  authorities  toler- 
ated no  conflict  between  the  unions'  goals  and  those  of  the  regime 
(see  Mass  Organizations,  ch.  2).  The  government  also  encouraged 
the  press  to  publicize  abuses  of  power  by  management  (see  Mass 
Media,  ch.  4). 

After  the  1968  reform,  organizations  also  emerged  to  represent 
economic  interest  groups,  and  some  of  these  organizations  acquired 
a  growing  influence  in  party  and  governmental  decision  making. 
The  government  required  private  and  semiprivate  entrepreneurs 
to  become  members  of  the  Small  Craftsmen's  National  Associa- 
tion, the  Small  Tradesmen's  National  Association,  or  the  Indus- 
trial Cooperatives'  National  Council.  In  1988,  about  900  small 
entrepreneurs  founded  the  National  Association  of  Entrepreneurs, 
which  worked  through  Hungary's  Chamber  of  Commerce.  In  the 
late  1980s,  the  National  Association  of  Entrepreneurs  actively  par- 
ticipated in  the  debate  over  a  law  on  business  organization. 

Economic  Sectors 

Industry  overtook  agriculture  in  the  postwar  era  to  become  the 
predominant  economic  sector.  In  1986  industry  accounted  for  50.7 
percent  of  gross  output;  agriculture  and  forestry,  18.2  percent;  non- 
material  branches  (generally  services),  11.3  percent;  construction, 
6.3  percent;  transportation,  post,  and  telecommunications,  5.6  per- 
cent; trade,  6.1  percent;  and  water  works  supply,  1  percent  (see 
table  6,  Appendix).  Industry  has  taken  up  most  of  the  investment 
funds  since  the  early  1960s,  followed  by  consumer  goods  and  ser- 
vices (the  nonmaterial  branches),  agriculture,  and  transportation 
and  communications  (see  table  7,  Appendix).  Despite  a  growing 


136 


The  Economy 


private  sector,  state-owned  enterprises  dominated  the  economy. 
According  to  official  statistics,  state-owned  enterprises  produced 
63.4  percent  of  national  income  in  1986;  the  cooperative  sector 
produced  23  percent;  auxiliary  farms  of  private  individuals,  6.6 
percent;  and  the  private  sector,  7  percent  (see  table  8,  Appendix). 
Economists  estimated  that  the  extralegal  "third  economy"  also 
made  up  a  significant  portion  of  the  country's  economic  life. 

Industry 

Energy  and  raw-material  extraction  accounted  for  13.1  percent 
of  gross  industrial  production  in  1986;  metallurgy  contributed  8.3 
percent;  engineering,  25.6  percent;  chemicals,  19.1  percent;  light 
industry,  12.9  percent;  food  processing,  16.8  percent;  building 
materials,  3.2  percent;  and  other  miscellaneous  industry,  1  per- 
cent. As  this  industrial  profile  shows,  Hungary's  industry  continued 
to  reflect  the  Stalinist  emphasis  on  heavy  industry  inherited  from 
the  immediate  postwar  period. 

Energy 

Chronic  coal-mining  problems  and  shrinking  domestic  hydro- 
carbon reserves  have  plagued  the  economy  since  the  mid-1970s. 
The  reliance  on  imported  energy  increased  steadily  from  37.2  per- 
cent in  1970  to  51.3  percent  in  1986.  The  Soviet  Union  furnished 
most  of  Hungary's  energy  imports,  but  Soviet  production  setbacks 
and  demands  for  better  trade  terms  complicated  Hungary's  energy 
supply  problems  after  the  mid-1980s.  Analysts  expected  the  Soviet 
Union  to  demand  more  and  better-quality  goods  from  Hungary 
in  exchange  for  its  energy  exports  in  the  1990s  (see  Relations  with 
the  Soviet  Union,  ch.  4). 

Hungary  slashed  investment  in  coal  mining  in  the  late  1960s  and 
1970s,  when  Soviet  oil  and  natural  gas  were  less  expensive  alter- 
nate fuels.  Consequently,  coal's  share  of  domestic  energy  produc- 
tion dropped  from  62.7  percent  in  1970  to  36.6  percent  in  1986. 
Coal  accounted  for  about  26  percent  of  Hungary's  energy  consump- 
tion. In  the  early  1980s,  rising  oil  and  natural  gas  prices  prompted 
Hungary  to  reopen  the  flow  of  investment  into  coal  mining  but 
the  country  still  suffered  from  a  severe  shortage  of  miners,  and  its 
mines  were  unable  to  keep  pace  with  rising  demand.  The  govern- 
ment approved  substantial  pay  increases  for  miners  in  order  to  at- 
tract new  workers.  In  1986  Hungary's  mines  employed  79,566 
workers  who  labored  between  sixty  and  seventy  hours  per  week 
and  produced  coal  worth  about  US$779  million.  Total  annual  coal 
output  has  hovered  around  24  million  tons  since  1975,  but  hard- 
coal  production  actually  fell  by  about  23  percent  between  1975  and 


137 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

1986,  and  the  calorific  value  of  coal  output  declined  by  about  18 
percent  in  the  same  period.  Coal,  coke,  and  briquette  imports 
totaled  US$268  million  in  1986. 

Hydrocarbons,  including  oil,  propane,  natural  gas,  and  gaso- 
line, accounted  for  61  percent  of  total  energy  consumption  in  1986. 
Natural-gas  production  has  increased  considerably  since  the 
mid-1960s,  exceeding  7  billion  cubic  meters  in  1986  and  1987. 
Domestic  consumption,  however,  has  far  outstripped  production 
since  1970,  nearly  doubling  from  5.9  billion  cubic  meters  in  1975 
to  11.5  billion  in  1986.  Hungary's  wells  supplied  about  94.8  per- 
cent of  its  natural-gas  consumption  in  1970  but  only  66.1  percent 
in  1986.  Natural-gas  imports  totaled  4.8  billion  cubic  meters  in 
1986  and  cost  about  US$366  million.  The  Soviet  Union  supplied 
Hungary  with  about  90  percent  of  its  natural- gas  imports. 

Hungarian  wells  have  pumped  about  2  million  tons  of  crude  oil 
yearly  since  1975,  mostly  from  the  Szeged  region,  but  observers 
expected  production  to  decline  after  1990.  Oil  imports  totaled 
US$1.1  billion  in  1986,  while  exports  added  up  to  about  US$332 
million.  Hungary  exported  oil  by  reselling  Iranian  and  other  Middle 
Eastern  oil  acquired  in  various  compensation  schemes. 

Hungary  launched  an  energy  rationalization  program  in  the  early 
1980s  aimed  at  maintaining  levels  of  domestic  oil  and  gas  produc- 
tion attained  in  the  mid-1980s,  increasing  exploration,  and  sub- 
stituting natural  gas  and  other  fuels  for  oil.  The  conservation 
program,  backed  by  stiff  price  hikes,  netted  positive  results.  Oil 
consumption  dipped  from  12.5  million  tons  in  1979  to  9.1  million 
tons  in  1985,  and  Hungary's  imports  of  petroleum  and  petroleum 
products  dropped  from  about  US$1.3  billion  in  1985  to  US$1.1 
billion  in  1986. 

Hungary's  power  plants  had  a  6.8-billion-kilowatt  capacity  in 
1986  and  generated  28  billion  kilowatt-hours  of  electricity,  almost 
double  the  amount  generated  in  1970.  The  increase  failed,  however, 
to  keep  pace  with  demand  as  consumption  rose  from  17.9  billion 
kilowatt-hours  in  1970  to  38.6  billion  in  1986.  Hungary  overcame 
the  1986  shortfall  by  importing  1 1.9  billion  kilowatt-hours  of  elec- 
tricity. Transmission  lines  from  the  Soviet  Union  carried  about 
one-third  of  Hungary's  imported  electricity. 

In  the  late  1980s,  thermal  power  stations  generated  70  percent 
of  Hungary's  electricity  and  burned  about  65  percent  of  Hungary's 
brown  coal  production  and  nearly  all  of  its  lignite  output.  Hun- 
gary has  constructed  large  thermal  power  stations  in  the  last  15 
years,  including  a  1 .9-million-kilowatt  heat  and  power  plant  at 
Szazhalombatta  in  Pest  County  that  generated  almost  40  percent 
of  the  country's  electricity.

The  Economy 


Southern  Hungary's  uranium  reserves  supplied  the  880-million- 
kilowatt  Paks  nuclear  power  plant  in  Tolna  County,  the  country's 
only  nuclear  power  facility.  The  plant's  first  reactor  went  on  line 
in  1983,  and  its  second  followed  a  year  later.  In  1986  the  plant 
generated  7.4  billion  kilowatt-hours,  or  about  26.5  percent  of  the 
nation's  electricity  output  and  19.2  percent  of  its  consumption. 
Hungary  and  the  Soviet  Union  agreed  in  1986  to  build  four  addi- 
tional 440-megawatt  reactors  at  Paks  in  the  next  decade.  Officials 
hoped  that  the  plant  would  supply  about  40  percent  of  Hungary's 
electricity  by  the  early  2000s. 

In  the  late  1980s,  Hungary's  hydroelectric  power  stations  gener- 
ated less  than  1  percent  of  the  country's  electricity,  but  Hungary 
has  joined  with  Czechoslovakia  to  build  two  hydroelectric  power 
stations  on  the  Danube  at  Gabcikovo  in  Czechoslovakia  and  at 
Nagymaros  in  Hungary.  The  project,  which  was  scheduled  for  com- 
pletion by  1993,  received  Austrian  financial  assistance  (see  Rela- 
tions with  Other  Communist  Neighbors,  ch.  4).  However,  in  May 
1989  the  Hungarian  government  suspended  work  on  the  power 
station  because  of  public  concern  over  the  damage  it  threatened 
to  cause  to  the  environment.  The  power  stations'  total  projected 
capacity  was  3.6  billion  kilowatt-hours  per  year,  and  their  estimated 
cost  was  US$1.4  billion. 

Mineral  Mining  and  Metallurgy 

The  aluminum  industry  developed  rapidly  after  World  War  II 
and  in  the  late  1980s  employed  more  than  40,000  workers.  The 
production  of  bauxite  (used  in  making  aluminum)  more  than  dou- 
bled since  the  war,  reaching  more  than  3  million  tons  in  1986,  while 
alumina  (aluminum  oxide)  output  totaled  856,000  tons  in  the  same 
year.  Increased  bauxite  production  was  depleting  deposits  near  the 
surface,  however,  and  costly  deep  mining  had  become  necessary. 
Conversion  of  alumina  into  aluminum  is  highly  energy  intensive, 
and  a  lack  of  inexpensive  electricity  prevented  Hungary  from  con- 
verting more  than  25  percent  of  its  alumina  output.  Therefore, 
Hungary  had  to  import  about  65  percent  of  the  aluminum  con- 
sumed by  its  factories  each  year.  Under  an  exchange  agreement 
signed  in  1985,  Hungary  exported  530,000  tons  of  alumina  to  the 
Soviet  Union  each  year  for  smelting  in  return  for  205,000  tons  of 
aluminum.  In  the  late  1980s,  Hungary  received  significantly  less 
aluminum  per  unit  of  alumina  than  under  previous  agreements, 
largely  because  the  price  of  aluminum  had  risen  against  the  price 
of  alumina  on  world  markets  since  the  1960s.  In  the  late  1980s, 
Hungary's  aluminum-fabrication  industry  concentrated  more  on 
manufacturing  semifinished  and  specialized  products  and  less  on 


139 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


bulk  production  of  the  metal  in  the  unfinished  form.  The  major 
aluminum  processing  plant  was  the  Light  Metal  Works  at  Szekes- 
fehervar,  which  had  a  capacity  of  approximately  100,000  tons  per 
year  in  the  late  1970s.  Hungary  exported  much  of  its  bauxite,  alu- 
mina, and  aluminum  to  the  Comecon  countries. 

Soviet  technology  and  raw-material  inputs  were  key  factors  in 
the  development  of  Hungary's  iron  and  steel  industry  in  the  1950s. 
The  large  steel  mills  at  Dunaujvaros  in  Feher  County,  Ozd, 
Miskolc,  and  Budapest  have  used  local  low-grade  iron  ore,  but  more 
than  80  percent  of  their  raw-material  input  originated  in  the  Soviet 
Union.  In  the  late  1980s,  the  industry  suffered  from  several  major 
problems.  First,  Hungary's  iron  and  steel  mills  were  less  cost  ef- 
fective than  West  European  mills  because,  among  other  factors, 
Hungary  had  to  pay  to  transport  and  process  Soviet  ore  that  had 
only  a  relatively  low  (45-50  percent)  iron  content.  Second,  the  prices 
Hungary  received  for  its  iron  and  steel  exports  to  convertible- 
currency  markets  had  fallen.  These  exports  generated  losses  for 
the  industry,  but  Hungary  continued  the  trade  for  several  reasons: 
the  domestic  market  could  not  absorb  enough  output  to  maintain 
satisfactory  use  of  the  country's  mill  capacity,  the  state  subsidized 
losses  on  metallurgical  exports,  and  export  income  provided  the 
industry  with  the  grounds  to  increase  wages.  The  industry  under- 
went a  sweeping  reorganization  as  part  of  a  1987  restructuring  pro- 
gram that  included  the  elimination  of  2,400  jobs.  Hungary  produced 
no  iron  ore  in  1986,  and  analysts  expected  the  country  to  reduce 
iron  and  steel  output  by  up  to  10  percent  in  1988. 

Engineering  and  Chemicals 

Throughout  the  postwar  period,  the  engineering  and  chemical 
branches  have  been  the  most  important  in  Hungary's  industrial 
sector.  The  engineering  sector  employed  about  32  percent  of  Hun- 
gary's industrial  workers  in  1986  and  produced  25.5  percent  of  the 
country's  total  industrial  output;  the  chemical  sector  employed  7.5 
percent  of  the  industrial  work  force  and  accounted  for  19  percent 
of  industrial  output. 

Hungary's  vehicle-manufacturing  subbranch  emphasized 
production  of  buses  and  axle  housing  and  accounted  for  about  28 
percent  of  the  engineering  branch's  output  in  1986.  Comecon  as- 
signed production  of  large  buses  to  Hungary  in  the  1950s.  Hun- 
gary's Ikarus  bus  enterprise  became  the  world's  fourth-largest  bus 
producer,  accounting  for  about  20  percent  of  the  world's  bus  ex- 
ports in  1980.  The  engineering  branch  also  produced  tractors,  diesel 
locomotives,  river  vessels,  floating  cranes,  machine  tools,  passenger 


140 


The  Economy 


elevators,  batteries,  telephone  equipment,  lighting  equipment,  and 
other  products. 

The  chemical  branch  grew  faster  than  any  of  the  other  branches 
after  the  1960s,  and  in  1986  the  chemical  branch's  133  enterprises 
accounted  for  19  percent  of  industrial  output.  Its  main  subbranches 
produced  fertilizers,  pharmaceuticals,  and  petrochemicals.  The 
pharmaceutical  industry  was  more  than  a  century  old  and  accounted 
for  1.5  percent  of  world  production.  Hungary  ranked  second  to 
Switzerland  in  per  capita  pharmaceutical  exports  and  fifth  in  the 
world  in  overall  pharmaceutical  exports.  It  was  also  Comecon's 
largest  pharmaceutical  supplier.  Pharmaceutical  production  ex- 
panded at  a  nearly  18  percent  annual  rate  since  1960,  satisfying 
80  percent  of  Hungary's  market.  Western  markets  purchased  40 
percent  of  Hungary's  pharmaceutical  exports.  In  1986  the  phar- 
maceutical industry's  output  totaled  about  US$513  million. 

Rapidly  rising  demand  for  synthetic  materials  and  a  desire  to 
replace  imports  with  domestic  production  prompted  Hungary  to 
begin  developing  a  petrochemical  industry  on  the  eve  of  the  1973 
oil  crisis.  The  project,  which  required  significant  investment  and 
integration  with  the  Soviet  economy,  proceeded  despite  the  changes 
that  the  oil  crisis  brought  to  the  market.  In  1989  five  Hungarian 
refineries  produced  petroleum  products,  but  four  were  too  small 
to  take  advantage  of  economies  of  scale.  Analysts  expected  a  large 
portion  of  Hungary's  refinery  capacity  to  remain  underutilized  until 
sometime  in  the  1990s.  The  synthetic-fiber,  chemical- additive,  and 
phosphorus-fertilizer  branches  were  especially  problematic. 

Light  Industry  and  Food  Processing 

The  government  neglected  the  consumer-oriented  light-industry 
and  food-processing  branches  of  the  economy  during  its  push  to 
develop  heavy  industry  in  the  1950s.  This  policy  resulted  in  short- 
ages, poor  quality,  a  narrow  product  mix,  and  slow  development 
of  new  products.  Since  that  time,  production  of  light  industrial 
goods,  such  as  textiles,  garments,  furniture,  pulp,  and  other 
products,  has  improved  significantly.  In  1985  Hungary  exported 
about  65  percent  of  its  silk  fabric  production,  50  percent  of  its  cloth- 
ing and  footwear  output,  and  25  percent  of  its  textiles. 

Although  Hungary  has  not  had  food  shortages  for  years,  its  food- 
processing  branch  has  modernized  slowly  and  produces  only  a 
limited  range  of  foodstuffs.  Given  the  importance  of  foodstuffs  in 
Hungary's  export  profile,  the  slow  growth  of  the  food-processing 
industry  has  prevented  the  country  from  capturing  potential 
markets.  In  the  late  1980s,  the  branch's  main  products  included 
wine,  flour,  canned  goods,  sugar,  beer,  dairy  products,  and  meat 


141 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

products.  After  1970  many  state  and  collective  farms  set  up  food- 
processing  operations  (see  Agricultural  Organization,  this  ch.). 

High  Technology 

Hungary  has  developed  a  small  but  viable  computer  industry 
since  the  late  1960s.  The  Videoton  electronics  firm,  which  was  one 
of  Eastern  Europe's  most  aggressive  computer  manufacturers,  de- 
veloped several  computer  models  in  the  1970s  and  has  exported 
its  computer  products  to  West  Germany,  Austria,  Finland,  and 
the  Comecon  countries.  Economic  reforms  in  the  early  1980s  cleared 
the  way  for  state  firms,  research  institutes,  private  partnerships, 
and  even  individuals  to  manufacture  personal  computers.  Hun- 
gary possessed  an  impressive  software-producing  capability,  and 
many  Western  countries  have  purchased  Hungarian  programs  or 
subcontracted  with  Hungarian  designers  to  develop  software.  Un- 
fortunately, the  microelectronics  industry  suffered  a  major  blow 
in  1986  when  a  fire  gutted  its  most  important  plant,  located  in 
Budapest.  In  1986  the  high-technology  industry  produced  5,128 
small  computers,  145,717  semiconductors,  and  20,690  integrated 
circuits. 

Agriculture 

The  success  of  the  agricultural  sector  in  large  part  has  under- 
pinned the  country's  high  standard  of  living  relative  to  the  other 
countries  of  Eastern  Europe.  Agriculture  provided  an  abundance 
of  food,  that,  at  least  until  the  late  1980s,  reinforced  social  and  po- 
litical stability.  Hungary's  farms  also  supplied  about  25  percent 
of  the  country's  convertible-currency  exports,  which  were  key  be- 
cause they  funded  imports  of  Western  technology  vital  to  indus- 
trial development.  But  the  agricultural  system  also  faced  several 
nagging  problems,  including  high  production  costs,  difficulties  in 
carving  out  new  markets,  and  dependence  on  imported  protein 
feeds,  agricultural  machinery,  nonnitrogenous  fertilizers,  and  other 
inputs. 

In  the  late  1980s,  agricultural  output  was  divided  about  equally 
between  plant  and  animal  production.  The  country's  main  crops 
were  corn,  wheat,  and  sugar  beets;  its  main  animal  products  were 
poultry,  hogs,  eggs,  and  milk  (see  table  9,  Appendix).  Hungary 
had  been  a  net  exporter  of  grain  since  1973  and  in  the  late  1980s 
was  Eastern  Europe's  largest  exporter  of  meat  and  meat  products. 

Hungarian  agriculture's  capital-intensive  nature  and  its  scale  of 
production  were  closer  to  West  European  than  East  European  levels. 
The  agricultural  sector  used  fewer  but  more  powerful  tractors  in 
1986  (53,947)  than  it  did  in  1970  (67,472).  Hungary  also  reduced 


142 


The  Economy 


the  amount  of  irrigated  land  and  cut  fertilizer  use.  Irrigated  lands 
shrank  from  an  average  of  249,100  hectares  in  the  1971-75  period 
to  162,600  hectares  in  1986.  Fertilizer  use  fell  from  224  kilograms 
per  hectare  in  1975  to  212  in  1986,  while  manure  use  grew  slightly. 

In  1986  the  129  state  farms  worked  26.1  percent  of  the  coun- 
try's cultivated  land  (2,159  hectares),  employed  17.6  percent  of 
the  agricultural  work  force  (163,000),  and  produced  17.6  percent 
of  the  country's  agricultural  gross  output  (about  US$1 .2  billion — see 
table  10,  Appendix).  Cooperative  farming  remained  the  largest  so- 
cial sector  in  the  agricultural  sector.  In  1986  some  1,260  coopera- 
tive farms  worked  76  percent  of  the  cultivated  land,  employed  74. 1 
percent  of  the  agricultural  work  force  (691,000),  and  produced  51 
percent  of  the  country's  agricultural  gross  output  (US$3.4  billion). 

In  1986  cooperative-farm  members'  household  plots  combined 
with  auxiliary  and  private  farms  to  produce  31.3  percent  of  agricul- 
tural gross  output.  These  producers  also  supplied  significant  por- 
tions of  specific  crop  and  animal  products.  For  example,  in  1986 
household  plots  and  private  farms  produced  76  percent  of  Hun- 
gary's potatoes,  74.7  percent  of  its  vegetables,  58.6  percent  of  its 
fruits,  48.8  percent  of  its  wine  grapes,  24.1  percent  of  its  cattle, 
55.5  percent  of  its  pigs,  and  43.1  percent  of  its  poultry. 

Construction 

In  1986  the  construction  sector  accounted  for  nearly  US$5  bil- 
lion in  production.  The  sector  had  165  state-owned  construction 
enterprises  employing  an  average  of  1,223  workers,  531  coopera- 
tive construction  firms  with  an  average  of  123  workers,  460  eco- 
nomic work  cooperatives  with  an  average  of  11  members,  2,745 
private  economic  partnerships  with  an  average  of  8.5  members, 
and  24,229  private  crafts  people  who  mainly  worked  alone.  Hous- 
ing accounted  for  33.8  percent  of  construction  activity  in  1986;  in- 
dustrial building  construction  accounted  for  9.5  percent;  roadway 
construction,  6.4  percent;  and  cultural  and  educational  buildings, 
5.1  percent. 

Transportation  and  Telecommunications 

The  nation's  transportation  and  communications  systems  were 
highly  centralized  because  of  Budapest's  importance  as  the  capital 
and  principal  urban  center  (see  fig.  7).  Like  other  East  European 
countries,  Hungary  redirected  much  of  its  transport  system  after 
World  War  II  to  accommodate  a  dramatic  increase  in  trade  with 
the  Soviet  Union.  Despite  the  fact  that  transportation  employed 
about  14  percent  of  the  total  work  force  in  the  late  1980s,  trans- 
portation delays  were  frequent.

Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

Hungary  began  constructing  the  main  lines  of  its  railroad  sys- 
tem between  1850  and  1900  in  order  to  link  Budapest  with  other 
major  cities.  In  1986  this  system  consisted  of  7,769  kilometers  of 
rail  lines,  of  which  1,128  kilometers  were  double  tracked.  Diesel 
and  electric  locomotives  have  replaced  steam  engines,  and  the  length 
of  electrified  track  almost  tripled  between  1970  and  1986,  reach- 
ing about  25  percent  of  the  system.  The  country's  two  rail- transport 
enterprises  employed  about  134,000  workers  in  1986.  The  railroads 
carried  about  119  million  tons  of  freight  in  1986,  about  20  percent 
of  which  were  coal  and  other  fuels;  they  also  carried  232,920  pas- 
sengers. The  system  improved  its  fuel  consumption  per  ton- 
kilometer  from  1,235  kilojoules  in  1970  to  322  in  1986. 

In  the  late  1980s,  Hungary's  140,163  kilometers  of  roadway, 
21  percent  of  which  were  paved  with  asphalt  or  concrete,  carried 
a  greater  volume  of  freight  than  the  railroad.  The  country's  sixty- 
six  truck  and  bus  fleets  carried  4.5  million  passengers  and  572  mil- 
lion tons  of  goods  in  1986  and  employed  122,000  workers.  In  1986 
the  nation's  truck  and  bus  fleets  totaled  163,151  and  25,920  trucks 
and  buses,  respectively,  more  than  double  their  size  in  1970;  pas- 
senger automobiles  numbered  1,538,900,  including  1,500,800  pri- 
vate automobiles.  Hungary  has  modernized  its  road  system  since 
1950,  but  the  roads  were  still  inadequate  to  handle  the  country's 
increasing  number  of  private  automobiles  and  heavier  domestic 
and  international  truck  traffic. 

The  Danube  formed  the  largest  part  of  Hungary's  1,622  kilo- 
meters of  navigable  waterway.  The  principal  port  was  Budapest's 
Csepel  free  port.  Dunauvaros  was  also  an  important  port.  In  1986 
Hungary's  fleet  included  52  passenger  boats,  41  tugboats,  236 
barges,  and  15  seagoing  ships.  The  river  transport  system  carried 
3.4  million  tons  of  cargo  and  4. 1  million  passengers,  most  of  whom 
were  tourists. 

The  national  airline,  MALEV,  flew  twenty- four  aircraft  on  forty- 
one  international  routes  in  1986,  carrying  1.2  million  passengers 
and  16,372  tons  of  cargo.  Hungary  discontinued  domestic  air  trans- 
port in  1969.  Several  major  Western  airlines  flew  into  Budapest's 
Ferihegy  Airport,  which  in  1986  recorded  18,025  takeoffs  and 
departures  and  served  2.3  million  passengers. 

A  5,604-kilometer  pipeline  network  linked  Hungary's  main  oil- 
and  natural  gas-producing  centers  with  Budapest  and  other  major 
cities.  The  system  transported  20.2  million  tons  of  oil  and  natural 
gas  in  1986.  In  the  mid-  to  late  1980s,  Hungary  annually  received 
about  1 .2  billion  cubic  meters  of  Soviet  natural  gas  through  the  two 
Friendship  pipelines  and  an  additional  4  billion  cubic  meters  through 
the  Alliance  pipeline.  In  1986  Hungary  and  the  Soviet  Union  began 


146

negotiations  on  Hungary's  participation  in  the  construction  of  what 
was  to  be  the  longest  natural  gas  pipeline  in  the  world.  Planners 
projected  completion  by  1990. 

In  the  late  1980s,  Hungary  continued  to  suffer  from  a  severe 
shortage  of  telephone  lines.  In  1986  the  country  had  770,200  tele- 
phones, including  524,600  private  telephones,  which  gave  it  about 
145  telephones  per  1,000  persons,  an  increase  of  46  percent  since 
1975.  Despite  this  increase,  the  average  wait  for  the  installation 
of  a  telephone  was  about  fifteen  years.  Telephone  possession  was 
one  of  the  clearest  indicators  of  class  distinctions  in  Hungary.  A 
1983  study  showed  that  only  6  percent  of  Hungary's  unskilled  and 
semiskilled  workers  had  a  telephone,  while  40  percent  of  profes- 
sionals had  them.  The  telephone  system  did  not  have  the  capacity 
to  accommodate  computer  telecommunications.  In  the  late  1980s, 
Hungary  had  two  television  channels,  and  it  issued  more  than  2.9 
million  television  licenses  in  1986.  Licenses  to  purchase  radios  were 
not  required  after  1980. 

Private  Sector 

Small  private  enterprises  have  multiplied  rapidly  since  1982, 
when  the  government  eased  legal  restrictions.  But  in  1989,  the 


147 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

private  sector  as  a  whole  still  made  up  only  a  small  portion  of  the 
economy.  The  government's  tally  of  persons  who  reported  private 
economic  activity  as  their  primary  occupation  showed  that  the  pri- 
vate sector  accounted  for  only  5.1  percent  of  active  earners  in  1986. 
The  private  sector  did,  however,  account  for  13.7  percent  of  the 
active  earners  involved  in  construction,  16.5  percent  of  those  in 
transport,  and  12.6  percent  of  those  in  personal-  or  economic- service 
businesses.  In  1986  Hungary  had  150,664  private  crafts  people, 
up  from  86,303  in  1970  and  111,960  in  1981.  Just  under  52  per- 
cent of  the  crafts  people  plied  their  trade  as  their  principal  occupa- 
tion, about  12  percent  were  pensioners,  and  36  percent  were 
employed  full  time  in  other  fields. 

As  officially  defined,  the  private  sector's  contribution  to  net 
material  product  rose  from  only  2.6  percent  in  1970  to  3.5  percent 
in  1980  and  7  percent  in  1986.  Although  the  private  sector's  por- 
tion of  industrial  production  only  increased  from  1  percent  in  1970 
to  1.8  percent  in  1986,  its  share  of  the  construction  industry  more 
than  doubled  from  6.3  percent  in  1970  to  14.5  percent  in  1986. 

The  Third  Economy 

A  semilegal  or  illegal  "third  economy"  operated  in  Hungary 
as  it  did  in  other  communist  countries.  Activities  in  the  third  econ- 
omy included  holding  unofficial  second  jobs,  moonlighting  on 
vacations  and  sick  leave,  performing  outside  work  during  work 
hours,  dealing  in  illegally  imported  or  pilfered  goods,  lending  money 
at  high  rates,  renting  property  illegally,  evading  taxes,  and  brib- 
ing or  "tipping"  doctors,  lawyers,  store  clerks,  and  others.  In  a 
1983  survey,  60  percent  of  hospital  patients  admitted  they  had  paid 
their  doctors  even  though  Hungary  had  free  national  health  care. 
Many  of  those  active  in  the  third  economy  had  become  relatively 
rich,  and  tension  sometimes  arose  between  the  third  economy's 
"haves"  and  the  law-abiding  "have-nots."  The  press  attributed 
the  third  economy's  existence  to  three  main  factors:  shortages  of 
certain  goods  and  services,  an  inflation  rate  that  made  supplemen- 
tary income  necessary,  and  the  fact  that  many  enterprises  possessed 
monopolies  on  certain  goods  and  services. 

Hungary's  Economic  Research  Institute  has  estimated  that  in 
the  early  1980s  Hungarians  generated  the  equivalent  of  about  US$2 
billion  per  year  in  unreported  income,  which  equaled  about  20  to 
25  percent  of  their  total  income  and  16  percent  of  domestic  net 
material  product.  The  newly  enacted  personal-income  and  value- 
added  taxes  were  in  part  an  attempt  to  tax  unreported  incomes, 
and  the  government  created  a  special  office  to  investigate  persons 
who  displayed  expensive  tastes  but  reported  relatively  low  incomes

(see  Economic  Regulators,  this  ch.).  Many  pro-reform  economists 
opposed  measures  to  snuff  out  illegal  economic  activities,  arguing 
instead  for  liberalizing  private-enterprise  laws  to  include  many 
activities  considered  illegal. 

Foreign  Trade 

Hungary  can  compensate  for  its  paucity  of  natural  resources  only 
by  engaging  in  foreign  trade,  which,  in  the  late  1980s,  accounted 
for  about  half  the  country's  national  income.  After  the  Great  Depres- 
sion, commerce  with  Germany  dominated  Hungary's  external  trade, 
and  agricultural  products  accounted  for  most  Hungarian  exports. 
After  World  War  II,  the  communist  government  limited  its  eco- 
nomic contacts  with  the  West,  and  the  Soviet  Union  became  the 
country's  principal  trading  partner.  Hungary  significantiy  increased 
trade  with  the  West  after  the  1968  economic  reforms  when  its  econ- 
omy could  no  longer  grow  without  imports  of  technology  and  raw 
materials  from  the  Western  nations.  It  signed  the  General  Agree- 
ment on  Tariffs  and  Trade  in  1973  and,  in  the  midst  of  a  balance 
of  payments  crisis,  joined  the  World  Bank  and  the  International 
Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary)  in  1982.  Although  in  the  late 
1980s  the  Soviet  Union  remained  Hungary's  principal  trading  part- 
ner, almost  half  of  Hungary's  trade  was  with  Western  countries. 
Production  shortfalls  had  forced  the  Soviet  Union  to  slow  exports 


149 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


of  oil  and  other  key  raw  materials,  forcing  Hungary  to  strive  to  uti- 
lize raw  materials  more  efficiently  and  increase  exports  to  the  West 
to  pay  for  additional  raw-material  imports.  The  need  to  boost  effi- 
ciency and  make  Hungarian  goods  competitive  on  Western  mar- 
kets also  prodded  the  government  to  undertake  economic  reforms. 

Ever- worsening  terms  of  trade,  increasing  Western  protectionism, 
reduced  access  to  foreign  credit,  interest-rate  increases,  and  the 
generally  slow  response  of  Hungarian  enterprises  to  changing  mar- 
ket conditions  brought  the  country  serious  foreign-trade  imbalances 
after  1987.  The  net  foreign  hard  currency  debt  more  than  dou- 
bled from  US$7  billion  in  1981  to  US$15.5  billion  in  1987,  mak- 
ing its  per  capita  foreign  debt  the  highest  among  the  communist 
states.  Hungary  had  to  spend  between  65  and  70  percent  of  its 
convertible- currency  earnings  to  service  its  debt.  Despite  the  fact 
that  the  economy  did  not  meet  the  government's  debt-reduction 
target  in  1987,  analysts  predicted  that  the  convertible-currency  debt 
crisis  would  recede  as  a  government  austerity  program  began  to 
take  hold.  The  debt  and  current  accounts  deficit,  which  analysts 
estimated  to  be  US$1 .2  billion  in  1987,  prompted  Hungary  to  con- 
clude a  standby  credit  agreement  with  the  IMF  in  1988. 

Organization  of  Foreign  Trade 

The  government  maintained  a  state  monopoly  on  foreign  trade 
until  1988,  when  it  began  allowing  all  but  a  few  production  en- 
terprises to  participate  in  foreign  trade.  In  1989  the  country's 
once-powerful  foreign-trade  enterprises  still  existed,  but  they  held 
exclusive  trading  rights  on  only  a  narrow  range  of  goods.  The 
Ministry  of  Trade's  chief  control  instrument  on  foreign  trade  was 
the  licensing  of  imports  and  exports,  which  the  ministry  could  use 
to  avoid  balance  of  trade  and  balance  of  payments  disequilibria. 
For  example,  the  ministry  could  deny  an  enterprise  a  license  to 
export  a  product  to  the  Comecon  market  in  order  to  encourage 
its  export  to  the  convertible- currency  market.  The  ministry  issued 
import  licenses  according  to  a  list  of  priority  items.  Highest-priority 
goods  were  those  necessary  to  maintain  current  production,  includ- 
ing raw  materials,  semifinished  goods,  and  spare  parts.  Second  pri- 
ority went  to  capital  goods  and  machinery  that  could  quickly  boost 
hard-currency  exports.  Basic  consumer  goods  and  nonessential  and 
luxury  items  constituted  the  two  lowest  categories.  The  govern- 
ment enacted  austerity  measures  in  1 988  that  limited  imports  almost 
exclusively  to  the  most  essential  items. 

Cooperation  Agreements  and  Joint  Ventures 

In  addition  to  engaging  in  direct  foreign  trade  in  the  late 
1980s,  enterprises  and  foreign  firms  could  enter  into  cooperation 


150 


The  Economy 


agreements  or  joint  ventures  that  gave  Hungary  access  to  Western 
technology  and  opened  new  markets.  Cooperation  agreements  took 
many  forms,  including  the  sale  of  a  plant  or  production  line  with 
partial  payment  to  the  seller  made  from  products  from  the  plant 
or  line;  the  subcontracting  of  a  domestic  firm  to  manufacture 
products;  license  agreements  under  which  the  foreign  partner 
provided  technology  to  the  Hungarian  partner  to  produce  a  par- 
ticular product;  and  production  agreements  under  which  the  for- 
eign partner  provided  equipment,  expertise,  manufacturing 
processes,  and  sometimes  financing  to  the  domestic  enterprise  and 
then  purchased  all  or  part  of  the  output.  In  the  late  1980s,  the 
government  levied  a  40-percent  tax  on  profits  from  cooperation 
agreements.  The  1988  foreign- trade  law  gave  Hungarian  enter- 
prises greater  freedom  to  conclude  cooperation  agreements.  Western 
companies  tended  to  prefer  cooperation  agreements  to  joint  ven- 
tures because  cooperation  agreements  were  more  flexible  and  car- 
ried less  risk. 

The  closest  cooperation  between  Hungarian  and  foreign  firms 
took  place  through  joint  ventures,  which  the  government  first 
legalized  in  1972.  In  a  joint  venture,  a  foreign  firm  and  a  domes- 
tic enterprise  each  put  up  capital  to  establish  a  new  company  to 
produce  goods  or  services.  Hungarian  law  required  that  the  Hun- 
garian enterprise  hold  at  least  a  51  percent  stake,  except  in  such 
areas  as  banking  and  services,  in  which  the  Ministry  of  Finance 
could  authorize  the  foreign  owner  to  be  the  majority  shareholder. 
In  1985  a  West  German  cosmetics  firm  became  the  first  nonbank- 
ing  Western  firm  to  hold  a  51  percent  stake  in  a  joint  venture  with 
a  Hungarian  enterprise.  The  government  levied  a  20-percent  profit 
tax  on  joint  ventures  and  permitted  the  foreign  partner  to  repatri- 
ate its  share  of  the  earnings  in  convertible  currency.  The  Hungar- 
ian National  Bank  guaranteed  the  foreign  partner's  share  of  the 
capital  against  state  takeover  subsequent  to  the  agreement.  When 
a  joint  venture  terminated,  the  foreign  firm  could  repatriate  its  share 
of  the  capital  investment.  Only  three  joint  ventures  were  operat- 
ing in  1977,  and  in  an  effort  to  entice  more  foreign  partners  the 
government  broadened  the  joint-venture  law  several  times  and 
created  customs-free  zones  in  1983.  The  number  of  joint  ventures 
rose  to  35  in  1984  and  to  more  than  100  in  1988.  Most  of  Hun- 
gary's joint  ventures  involved  companies  from  West  Germany,  Aus- 
tria, Switzerland,  the  United  States,  and  Sweden. 

Hungarian  enterprises  frequently  requested  foreign  partners  in 
joint  ventures  or  cooperation  agreements  to  take  payment  in  kind 
and  then  market  the  goods  in  the  West.  Analysts  estimated  that 
these  and  other  countertrade  arrangements  have  made  up  a  sizable 
share  of  Hungary's  trade  with  the  West  since  the  early  1970s,  but 


151

exact  figures  were  unavailable  in  mid- 1989.  The  frequency  and  size 
of  requests  for  countertrade  increased  after  Hungary  began  austerity 
measures  to  reduce  its  foreign  debt  and  trade  deficit  in  1988. 

Trade  Volume  and  Structure 

Total  trade  turnover,  at  1986  prices,  rose  from  US$13.4  billion 
in  1981  to  US$18.8  billion  in  1986.  Hungary's  exports  increased 
from  US$6.5  billion  to  US$9.2  billion  in  the  same  period,  while 
its  imports  increased  from  US$6.9  billion  to  US$9.6  billion. 

The  principal  imports  were  crude  oil,  coal,  iron  ore,  copper,  raw 
materials  for  the  plastics  industry,  chemical  fibers,  artificial  fer- 
tilizers, paper,  cotton,  animal  feed,  and  capital  and  consumer  goods. 
Raw  materials,  semifinished  goods,  and  spare  parts  accounted  for 
44.8  percent  of  imports  in  1986.  Energy  imports  increased  from 
6  percent  of  total  imports  in  1970  to  19.4  percent  in  1986  (see 
table  11,  Appendix). 

Hungary's  main  exports  included  agricultural  products,  phar- 
maceuticals, bauxite,  machine  tools,  buses,  telecommunications  and 
electronic  equipment,  lighting  equipment,  industrial  rubber  goods, 
ball  bearings,  rolled  steel  and  aluminum,  clothing,  and  footwear. 
In  1986  raw  materials,  semifinished  goods,  and  spare  parts  ac- 
counted for  30.2  percent  of  exports.  Exports  of  machinery,  trans- 
port equipment,  and  capital  goods  increased  from  16.7  percent  of 
total  exports  in  1970  to  30  percent  in  1986.  Likewise,  agricultural 
exports  rose  from  7.4  percent  of  total  exports  in  1970  to  20.1  per- 
cent in  1986.  Grain  exports  increased  from  an  average  of  about 
1  million  tons  a  year  from  1976-80  to  nearly  2.2  million  tons  in 
1986.  Meat  exports  also  rose,  from  an  average  of  285,000  tons  a 
year  from  1976-80  to  421,000  tons  in  1986  (see  table  12,  Appendix). 

Tourism  enhanced  Hungary's  hard-currency  balance  sheet.  The 
number  of  foreign  tourists  visiting  Hungary  rose  from  4  million 
in  1984  to  10.6  million  in  1986,  including  2  million  from  noncom- 
munist  countries.  Tourist  spending  netted  Hungary  about  US$371 
million  in  1986.  Most  visitors  came  from  Czechoslovakia,  Poland, 
Austria,  and  Yugoslavia;  approximately  117,000  Americans  visit- 
ed the  country  in  1985.  About  6.3  million  Hungarians  traveled 
abroad  in  1986,  mostly  in  Eastern  Europe.  In  1988  the  govern- 
ment further  eased  restrictions  on  its  citizens'  foreign  travel. 

Trade  Partners 

Hungary's  foreign  trade  was  about  evenly  split  between  the 
Comecon  countries  and  the  West.  Trade  with  the  Comecon  market 
accounted  for  53.1  percent  of  its  trade  turnover  in  1986,  an  in- 
crease from  49.3  percent  in  1980.  Total  trade  turnover  with  the 


152 


The  Economy 


Comecon  countries,  measured  at  1986  prices,  increased  from  about 
US$6.8  billion  in  1981  to  US$10  billion  in  1986.  Exports  to  the 
Comecon  countries  increased  from  US$3.6  billion  to  US$5.1  bil- 
lion in  the  same  period,  while  its  imports  from  those  countries  rose 
from  US$3.3  billion  to  US$4.9  billion. 

In  1986  more  than  90  percent  of  the  country's  energy  imports, 
42.5  percent  of  its  raw-  and  basic-materials  imports,  and  more  than 
60  percent  of  its  capital- goods  imports  came  from  the  Comecon 
countries.  In  addition,  48  percent  of  exports  of  raw-materials  and 
semifinished  goods,  84.3  percent  of  its  machinery  and  capital-goods 
exports,  and  more  than  half  of  the  exports  of  industrial  consumer 
goods  and  agricultural  products  went  to  the  Comecon  market. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  Soviet  Union,  plus  three  other  Comecon 
countries — the  German  Democratic  Republic  (East  Germany), 
Czechoslovakia,  and  Poland — made  up  four  of  Hungary's  six  most 
important  trading  partners.  The  Soviet  Union  was  Hungary's  main 
trading  partner,  accounting  for  more  than  30  percent  of  Hun- 
gary's overall  trade  and  60  percent  of  its  trade  with  the  Comecon 
countries  (see  table  13,  Appendix).  Raw  materials  and  energy  domi- 
nated the  structure  of  Soviet-Hungarian  trade.  Under  the  Soviet- 
Hungarian  trade  agreement  for  the  Seventh  Five- Year  Plan  (1986- 
90),  Hungary  agreed  to  export  foodstuffs,  computers,  telecommu- 
nications equipment,  buses,  and  other  finished  goods  to  the  Soviet 
Union.  In  turn,  Hungary  imported  mining  equipment,  heavy 
machinery,  some  consumer  goods,  and  even  larger  amounts  of 
Soviet  raw  materials  and  energy  than  it  did  in  the  preceding  plan. 
East  Germany,  Hungary's  third  largest  trading  partner,  Czecho- 
slovakia, and  Poland  accounted  for  about  16.5  percent  of  Hun- 
gary's overall  trade  and  31.1  percent  of  its  trade  with  the  Comecon 
countries. 

About  half  of  Hungary's  trade  was  with  Western  countries.  Trade 
turnover  with  the  Western  world  was  US$7.9  billion  in  1986;  im- 
ports totaled  US$4.2  billion,  and  exports  amounted  to  US$3.7 
billion. 

In  June  1988,  Hungary  and  the  European  Economic  Commu- 
nity (EEC)  signed  a  ten-year  trade  agreement,  the  first  of  its  kind 
between  the  EEC  and  a  Comecon  country.  The  agreement  provided 
for  a  reduction  of  quotas  on  about  2,000  items  by  1995.  Hungar- 
ian officials  estimated  that  the  trade  would  boost  Hungary's  hard- 
currency  exports  from  US$25  million  to  US$50  million  by  1995. 
In  1987  the  EEC  countries  accounted  for  24.4  percent  of  Hungary's 
imports  and  19.9  percent  of  its  exports.  Hungary  accumulated  a 
US$5  billion  trade  deficit  with  the  EEC  countries  between  1979 
and  1986. 


153 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

West  Germany  was  Hungary's  largest  Western  trading  partner 
and  second  largest  trading  partner  overall.  Raw  materials  and  semi- 
finished goods  made  up  about  65  percent  of  the  US$1.2  billion 
of  goods  that  Hungary  imported  from  West  Germany  in  1986; 
machinery  and  equipment  made  up  about  another  20  percent. 
Hungary's  exports  to  West  Germany  totaled  US$771  million  and 
included  foodstuffs,  live  animals,  machinery,  chemical  products, 
textiles,  clothing,  pharmaceuticals,  and  aluminum  products.  As  of 
1987,  West  German  banks  had  furnished  Hungary  with  more  than 
US$16  billion  in  loans;  in  the  same  year,  the  West  German  govern- 
ment guaranteed  a  twelve-year  credit  for  Hungary,  marking  the 
first  time  that  the  Hungarian  government  has  accepted  credits 
backed  by  a  foreign  government.  In  addition,  Hungary  and  West 
Germany  concluded  an  investment  protection  agreement  in  1986 
under  which  the  Bonn  government,  based  on  Hungarian  assur- 
ances, guaranteed  that  West  German  firms  with  investments  in 
Hungary  would  be  able  to  repatriate  their  profits  and  not  be  sub- 
ject to  nationalization  of  their  assets.  In  1987  West  German  firms 
had  about  330  cooperation  agreements  with  Hungarian  firms;  more 
than  half  were  in  engineering  and  machine  industries.  Siemens, 
Krupp,  Telefunken,  Volkswagen,  and  smaller  West  German  firms 
were  involved  in  about  thirty  joint  ventures  with  Hungarian  enter- 
prises (see  Relations  with  the  West,  ch.  4). 

Austria  was  Hungary's  second  largest  Western  trading  partner. 
In  1987  Hungary  imported  Austrian  goods  worth  US$574  million 
and  exported  US$594  million  in  goods  to  Austria.  In  1987  Aus- 
trian and  Hungarian  firms  were  engaged  in  120  cooperation  agree- 
ments and  fourteen  joint  ventures. 

Hungary  and  the  United  States  signed  their  first  trade  agree- 
ment in  1978,  and  Hungarian  goods  bound  for  American  ports 
enjoyed  most-favored-nation  status.  In  1988  ten  United  States- 
Hungarian  joint  ventures  operated  in  Hungary,  but,  excluding  Citi- 
bank Budapest's  holdings,  the  total  of  United  States  capital  invested 
in  Hungary  stood  at  a  mere  US$58  million.  In  1987  bilateral  United 
States-Hungarian  trade  reached  its  highest  mark  ever  at  more  than 
US$500  million.  Exports  to  the  United  States,  however,  accounted 
for  only  2.3  percent  of  Hungary's  exports  in  1986,  and  imports 
barely  exceeded  2  percent  of  Hungary's  total  imports. 

Trade  relations  with  Japan  were  growing  as  Hungary  sought 
Japanese  capital  and  technology  and  hoped  to  gain  a  share  of  the 
Japanese  market  as  that  country  opened  its  doors  to  foreign  trade. 
Hungary  imported  US$142  million  worth  of  Japanese  goods  in  1986 
while  exporting  only  US$42.4  million  in  goods.  Basic  materials  and 
semifinished  goods  accounted  for  more  than  half  of  Hungary's 


154 


The  Economy 


Japanese  imports;  machinery  and  consumer  goods  accounted  for 
27  percent  and  19  percent,  respectively.  More  than  65  percent  of 
Hungary's  exports  to  Japan  were  basic  materials  and  semifinished 
products,  including  pharmaceuticals,  aluminum,  and  chemical 
products;  foodstuffs  accounted  for  another  16  percent.  In  addition, 
Hungary  and  Japan  formed  their  first  joint  venture  in  1984  to 
produce  polyethylene  sheets  for  insulation. 

Hungary's  trade  with  developing  countries  totaled  about  US$1 .4 
billion  in  1986  and  represented  a  7.3  percent  share  of  its  total  trade, 
down  from  9.5  percent  in  1980.  Exports  to  the  developing  world 
consisted  of  machinery,  vehicles,  industrial  consumer  goods,  and 
agricultural  goods.  Hungary  imported  from  the  developing  coun- 
tries tropical  foods  and  other  agricultural  products,  petroleum  oil, 
clothing,  carpets,  electrical  appliances,  and  steel  products.  In  1985 
Hungary  joined  the  International  Finance  Corporation  and  the  In- 
ternational Development  Association,  both  of  which  are  World  Bank 
affiliates. 

Finally,  trade  with  China  rose  dramatically  from  about  US$1 12.7 
million  in  1984  to  US$343.9  million  in  1986.  However,  China  ac- 
counted for  less  than  2  percent  of  Hungary's  trade  in  1986. 

Domestic  Consumption 

Hungary's  domestic  trade  sector  differed  significantly  from  the 
cumbersome  rationing  system  that  existed  in  most  centrally  planned 
economies.  And  since  Hungary  began  implementing  economic  re- 
forms, the  production  sectors  of  the  economy  funneled  through  the 
trade  sector  a  far  better  supply  and  variety  of  goods  and  services 
than  Hungarians  had  enjoyed  earlier.  By  the  late  1980s,  Hungary's 
economy  had  largely  overcome  the  supply  shortages  that  tormented 
both  producers  and  consumers  in  countries  with  command  econo- 
mies. Still,  many  Hungarians  lived  at  or  below  the  officially  recog- 
nized poverty  level  (see  Social  Relations  in  the  1980s,  ch.  2). 

Domestic  Trade  Sector 

The  domestic  trade  sector  consisted  of  state-  and  cooperative- 
owned  wholesale  and  retail  enterprises  and  privately  owned  stores 
and  restaurants.  The  Ministry  of  Trade  oversaw  the  state-owned 
trade  enterprises,  and  all  state  and  cooperative  commercial  enter- 
prises could  engage  in  both  wholesale  and  retail  trade.  Private  mer- 
chants were  not  required  to  purchase  goods  from  the  wholesale 
dealers,  but  they  were  barred  from  functioning  as  wholesalers  them- 
selves. In  1986  Hungary  had  17,222  state  retail  stores,  20,163 
cooperative  ones,  and  22,230  private  ones.  Private  contractors 


155 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


managed  about  12  percent  of  the  total  number  of  state  and 
cooperative-owned  shops.  About  75  percent  of  the  445,000  people 
working  in  the  trade  sector  were  women.  Wages  in  the  sector  were 
10  percent  lower  than  the  national  average,  which  may  account 
for  the  fact  that  the  sector  had  high  employee  turnover.  In  1985 
Hungary  had  102  shops  that  sold  imported  goods  for  foreign  cur- 
rency with  annual  sales  topping  US$20  million. 

The  largest  retail  trade  enterprise  in  Hungary  was  the  Skala- 
Coop  chain,  which  several  cooperative  associations  founded  in  1974. 
Skala-Coop  began  purchasing  goods  directly  from  manufacturers 
and  used  modern  marketing  techniques,  flashy  advertising,  an 
aggressive  expansion  policy,  and  consumer  credit  to  capture  about 
13  percent  of  the  country's  entire  trade  by  1986.  The  chain  also 
became  the  first  large  trade  enterprise  to  gain  direct  foreign-trade 
rights. 

Standard  of  Living 

In  1989  the  supply  and  selection  of  food  and  other  consumer 
goods  in  Hungary  exceeded  those  in  most  other  East  European 
countries,  and  Hungarians  as  a  whole  suffered  nothing  similar  to 
the  hardship  that  the  Romanians  and  Bulgarians  endured  in  the 
1980s  as  a  result  of  government-ordered  energy  cutbacks.  In  1986 
Hungary's  per  capita  meat  consumption  was  the  highest  in  Eastern 
Europe,  while  its  egg  consumption  ranked  among  the  highest. 
Per  capita  consumption  of  meat,  fish,  milk  and  dairy  products, 
eggs,  vegetables,  potatoes,  coffee,  wine,  beer,  and  hard  liquor  all 
increased  significantly  between  1950  and  1984.  In  1960  the  majority 
of  households  had  both  a  bicycle  and  a  radio,  20  percent  owned 
a  washing  machine,  and  a  few  even  possessed  a  television,  a  refriger- 
ator, or  an  automobile.  By  1984,  96  out  of  100  households  owned 
a  washing  machine,  every  household  owned  a  refrigerator,  and  the 
ratio  of  television  sets  to  households  was  108  to  100.  The  quality 
and  variety  of  durable  consumer  goods  on  sale  had  also  improved. 
As  in  other  societies,  purchase  of  luxury  items  was  the  prerogative 
of  higher-income  groups.  For  example,  in  the  late  1980s  automo- 
biles were  owned  mostly  by  upper-  and  middle-income  households. 
As  of  1984,  only  34  out  of  100  households  owned  an  automobile. 

In  1986  the  total  disposable  income  of  all  Hungarians  was  the 
equivalent  of  US$17.2  billion.  Hungarians  spent  88  percent  of  that 
income,  saved  6.2  percent,  and  invested  5.8  percent  in  building 
their  own  housing.  Foodstuffs  accounted  for  27.1  percent  of  per- 
sonal spending;  services,  26.6  percent;  beverages  and  tobacco,  14.6 
percent;  other  consumer  goods,  11.6  percent;  clothing,  8.2  percent;

durable  goods,  7.9  percent;  and  heating  and  energy,  4  percent. 
The  state  paid  the  cost  of  medical  and  other  social  services  (see 
Health,  ch.  2). 

Official  Hungarian  sources  reported  that  the  average  per  capita 
monthly  wage  was  6,000  forints  in  1988,  about  14  percent  above 
the  officially  recognized  poverty  level  of  5,200  forints  (US$84). 
Economists  estimated  that  between  25  and  40  percent  of  the  peo- 
ple lived  below  the  poverty  level. 

Economic  Policy  and  Performance,  1945-85 

After  1949  Hungary's  communist  government  under  Matyas 
Rakosi  applied  the  Soviet  model  for  economic  development  (see 
Postwar  Hungary,  ch.  1).  The  government  used  coercion  and  bru- 
tality to  collectivize  agriculture,  and  it  squeezed  profits  from  the 
country's  farms  to  finance  rapid  expansion  of  heavy  industry,  which 
attracted  more  than  90  percent  of  total  industrial  investment.  At 
first  Hungary  concentrated  on  producing  primarily  the  same  as- 
sortment of  goods  it  had  produced  before  the  war,  including  locomo- 
tives and  railroad  cars.  Despite  its  poor  resource  base  and  its 
favorable  opportunities  to  specialize  in  other  forms  of  production, 
Hungary  developed  new  heavy  industry  in  order  to  bolster  further 


157 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

domestic  growth  and  produce  exports  to  pay  for  raw-material 
imports  (see  table  14,  Appendix).  The  Soviet  Union  became  Hun- 
gary's principal  trade  partner,  supplying  crude  oil,  iron  ore,  and 
much  of  the  capital  for  Hungary's  iron  and  steel  industry.  Heavy 
Soviet  demand  also  led  Hungary  to  develop  shipbuilding  and  tex- 
tile industries.  Trade  with  the  West  declined  considerably.  Soviet 
pressure,  a  Western  trade  embargo,  and  Hungarian  policies  favor- 
ing domestic  and  regional  autarky  combined  to  reduce  the  flow 
of  goods  between  Hungary  and  the  West  to  a  trickle  during  the 
Cold  War  period. 

Rakosi's  regime  also  established  wage  controls  and  a  two-tier 
price  system  made  up  of  producer  and  consumer  prices,  which  the 
government  controlled  separately.  In  the  early  1950s,  the  authori- 
ties used  these  new  controls  to  limit  domestic  demand  and  cut  rela- 
tive labor  costs  by  tripling  consumer  prices  and  holding  back  wages. 
Popular  dissatisfaction  mounted  as  the  economy  suffered  from 
material  shortages,  export  difficulties,  and  mounting  foreign  debt. 
Agricultural  growth  also  stagnated,  and  the  area  of  cultivated  land 
actually  decreased. 

During  the  thaw  after  Soviet  dictator  Joseph  Stalin  died  in  1953, 
Imre  Nagy  became  Hungary's  prime  minister  and,  following  the 
Soviet  example,  implemented  an  economic  policy  known  as  the 
New  Course.  Nagy's  administration  halted  the  collectivization 
drive,  allowed  farmers  to  leave  collective  farms,  abolished  com- 
pulsory production  quotas,  raised  procurement  prices  for  farm 
products,  and  increased  investment  in  agriculture.  Nagy  also  shifted 
investment  from  heavy  industry  to  consumer-goods  production. 
The  economic  system  itself,  however,  remained  unchanged,  and 
plan  fulfillment  actually  worsened  after  1953. 

Hard-line  party  members  soon  undermined  Nagy,  and  Rakosi 
regained  control  in  1955.  The  collectivization  drive  began  anew, 
and  the  government  redirected  investment  back  to  heavy  industry 
before  the  cataclysmic  Revolution  of  1956  brought  the  country's 
economy  to  a  standstill.  According  to  official  statistics,  the  econ- 
omy registered  an  11-percent  negative  growth  in  1956.  After  the 
revolution,  Janos  Kadar  and  others  in  the  new  leadership  under- 
stood that  they  had  to  gear  their  economic  policies  toward  improving 
the  population's  living  standard,  and  they  recognized  that  practi- 
cal considerations  had  to  temper  their  commitment  to  the  tenets 
of  Marxism-Leninism  as  defined  by  the  Soviet  Union.  From  1957 
to  1960,  consumption  grew  more  rapidly  than  national  income  as 
the  government  tried  to  assuage  popular  discontent.  Per  capita  real 
income  was  54  percent  higher  in  1960  than  it  had  been  in  1950. 

In  1959  the  Kadar  government  began  a  second  major  collectivi- 
zation drive.  Instead  of  using  coercion,  however,  the  government 


158

offered  peasants  incentives  to  join  cooperative  or  collective  farms. 
The  campaign  ended  in  1962  after  more  than  95  percent  of  agricul- 
tural land  had  come  under  the  socialist  sector's  control.  During 
the  1960s  and  1970s,  the  Hungarian  government  made  significant 
investments  in  agriculture  and  raised  farm  prices  in  an  effort  to 
make  the  sector  viable.  Agricultural  mechanization  also  expanded 
by  50  percent. 

During  the  1960s,  the  government  gave  high  priority  to  expand- 
ing the  industrial  sector's  engineering  and  chemical  branches. 
Production  of  buses,  machine  tools,  precision  instruments,  and 
telecommunications  equipment  received  the  most  attention  in  the 
engineering  sector.  The  chemical  sector  focused  on  artificial- 
fertilizer,  plastic,  and  synthetic-fiber  production.  The  Hungarian 
and  Comecon  markets  were  the  government's  primary  targets,  and 
the  policies  resulted  in  increased  imports  of  energy,  raw  materials, 
and  semifinished  goods. 

By  the  mid-1960s,  the  government  realized  that  the  policy  for 
industrial  expansion  it  had  followed  since  1949  was  no  longer  via- 
ble. Although  the  economy  was  growing  steadily  and  the  popula- 
tion's living  standard  was  improving,  key  factors  limited  further 
growth.  Returns  from  mining  were  diminishing,  and  Hungary  had 


159 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

exhausted  previously  untapped  manpower  reserves.  The  govern- 
ment recognized  that  the  efficiency  of  Hungary's  industries  lagged 
well  behind  that  of  Western  industries  and  that  its  communica- 
tion and  transportation  infrastructures  were  so  inadequate  that  they 
retarded  further  economic  growth.  The  Comecon  countries  were 
unable  to  supply  Hungary  with  sufficient  energy,  raw  materials, 
and  technology  to  achieve  further  growth,  and  Hungary's  leaders 
realized  that  the  country  would  have  to  seek  these  critical  inputs 
from  the  West.  The  government  introduced  the  NEM  in  1968  in 
order  to  improve  enterprise  efficiency  and  make  its  goods  more 
competitive  on  world  markets. 

From  1968  to  1972,  the  NEM  and  a  favorable  economic  environ- 
ment contributed  to  good  economic  performance.  The  economy 
grew  steadily,  neither  unemployment  nor  inflation  was  apparent; 
and  the  country's  convertible-currency  balance  of  payments  was 
in  equilibrium  as  exports  to  Western  markets  grew  more  rapidly 
than  its  imports.  Cooperative  farms  and  factories  rapidly  increased 
production  of  goods  and  services  that  were  lacking  before  the  re- 
form. By  about  1970,  Hungary  had  reached  the  status  of  a  medium- 
developed  country.  Its  industry  was  producing  40  to  50  percent 
of  the  gross  domestic  product,  while  agriculture  was  contributing 
less  than  20  percent. 

In  1973  and  1974,  in  the  midst  of  the  Fourth  Five- Year  Plan 
(1971-75)  world  oil  prices  skyrocketed.  Hungary's  terms  of  trade, 
that  is,  the  ratio  of  the  prices  Hungary  received  for  its  exports  to 
the  prices  it  had  to  pay  for  its  imports,  deteriorated  considerably. 
The  leadership  responded  to  the  new  conditions  with  several  major 
policy  errors,  which  reversed  the  changes  that  had  taken  place  under 
NEM.  First,  policy  makers  assumed  world  oil  prices  would  soon 
return  to  earlier  levels  and  concluded  that  the  economy  could  be 
shielded  from  the  capitalist  world's  crisis.  The  government  did  this 
shielding  by  subsidizing  enterprises  hard  hit  by  rising  energy  costs 
and  taxing  the  profits  of  enterprises  that  benefited  from  the  high 
world  prices.  Second,  the  authorities  chose  to  accelerate  economic 
growth  to  deal  with  Hungary's  deteriorating  terms  of  trade.  The 
Fifth  Five- Year  Plan  (1976-80)  emphasized  industrial  expansion 
and  modernization  and  provided  for  a  significant  increase  in  invest- 
ment. The  share  of  gross  investment  in  the  gross  domestic  product 
climbed  from  34  percent  in  1970  to  41  percent  in  1978.  Third,  the 
government  used  pre- 1974  price  and  demand  figures  to  justify 
launching  major  projects  that  the  economy  at  that  time  could  not 
carry  out  efficiently.  Finally,  planners  earmarked  significant  invest- 
ment resources  to  increase  the  country's  capacity  to  produce  energy, 
basic  materials,  and  simple  semifinished  goods  in  order  to  meet 


160 


The  Economy 


domestic  demand  and  increase  exports  to  the  Comecon  markets. 
However,  Hungary's  investments  did  not  spawn  a  modern  manu- 
facturing capacity,  which  is  the  kind  of  industrial  capacity  needed 
to  produce  output  for  sale  on  the  convertible-currency  market. 

Decision  makers  discovered  to  their  chagrin  that  they  could  not 
protect  the  economy  from  the  world  price  increases.  Because  the 
economy  depended  on  energy  and  raw-material  imports,  acceler- 
ated economic  growth  required  increased  imports  of  raw  materi- 
als and  energy  that  Hungary  could  not  obtain  from  the  Comecon 
countries.  Thus,  Hungary  had  to  turn  to  the  convertible-currency 
market  to  obtain  a  greater  proportion  of  its  inputs.  In  the  1970s, 
Hungary's  spending  on  consumption  and  investment  outstripped 
what  its  economy  produced  by  an  annual  average  of  2.2  percent; 
in  1978  alone  it  spent  5  percent  more.  The  export  earnings  did 
not  cover  the  cost  of  imports,  convertible-currency  trade  deficits 
quickly  piled  up,  and  the  government  used  foreign  credits  to  finance 
the  deficits.  In  addition,  the  government's  efforts  to  shield  the  coun- 
try's enterprises  from  Western  price  increases  backfired  as  Hun- 
gary's structure  of  production  and  investment  never  adjusted  to 
world  demand.  Antireform  politicians  and  managers  of  large  en- 
terprises won  partial  reinstatement  of  the  command  economy  by 
the  mid-1970s.  This  recentralization  exacerbated  Hungary's  eco- 
nomic woes  by  further  isolating  Hungary's  enterprises  from  mar- 
ket forces  and  prompting  managers  to  show  inadequate  concern 
for  efficiency,  waste,  and  the  competitiveness  of  their  products  on 
world  markets. 

Hungary's  economic  policy  makers  realized  by  1978  that  if  the 
economy  continued  to  run  trade  deficits,  the  country  would  soon 
be  unable  to  honor  its  debt  obligations.  In  1978  the  HSWP  de- 
cided to  revive  the  NEM.  A  year  later,  the  government  imple- 
mented a  stabilization  program  aimed  at,  among  other  things, 
redirecting  the  economy  away  from  heavy  industry,  improving  the 
convertible-currency  trade  balance,  and  shrinking  the  country's 
foreign  debt.  The  program's  architects  planned  to  maintain  cur- 
rent levels  of  material  consumption  for  several  years  in  order  to 
maximize  convertible-currency  exports;  at  the  same  time,  they 
planned  to  cut  spending  by  reducing  investment. 

New  external  shock  waves  rocked  the  economy  in  the  late  1970s, 
further  eroding  Hungary's  terms  of  trade  and  undercutting  the 
country's  creditworthiness  despite  the  reduction  in  investment.  Oil 
prices  rose  dramatically  and  precipitated  a  world  recession.  Soon 
interest  rates  rose,  and  Western  banks  reduced  the  flow  of  credits 
to  the  East  European  countries  in  1982  as  a  result  of  Poland's  debt 


161 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

moratorium,  Romania's  insolvency,  and  the  economic  sanctions 
levied  by  the  United  States  against  Poland  after  the  declaration 
of  martial  law  in  December  1981.  The  interest-rate  increases  helped 
to  increase  Hungary's  hard-currency  debt  (see  table  15,  Appen- 
dix). Before  the  rates  rose,  Hungary  relied  heavily  on  floating-rate, 
short-term  loans  whose  maturities  were  poorly  staggered.  In  1981 
more  than  80  percent  of  Hungary's  US$8.7  billion  convertible- 
currency  debt  was  due  within  five  years,  and  debt-servicing  costs 
consumed  about  33  percent  of  Hungary's  convertible-currency 
earnings.  In  1982  a  liquidity  crisis  in  Hungary  shook  the  confi- 
dence of  Western  bankers,  and  for  several  months  the  country  was 
unable  to  negotiate  new  credits  from  the  West. 

Eager  to  avoid  debt  rescheduling,  Hungary  joined  the  IMF  and 
the  World  Bank  in  1982  and  received  from  them  about  US$2  bil- 
lion in  loans.  In  addition,  Hungary  introduced  a  stricter  stabiliza- 
tion program  and  obtained  bridge  financing  from  the  Bank  for 
International  Settlements.  The  leadership  also  renewed  its  support 
for  economic  reforms,  which  creditors  viewed  as  a  positive  step 
toward  more  efficient  use  of  resources  and  improvement  of  the  coun- 
try's  balance  of  payments. 

Under  the  new  stabilization  program,  spending  on  investment 
and  consumption,  which  had  outstripped  the  amount  the  economy 
had  produced  by  6.9  percent  from  1974  to  1978,  fell  to  1  percent 
less  than  production  from  1979  to  1983.  By  1985  Hungary  had 
slashed  its  investment  spending  to  about  US$5.2  billion,  21.8  per- 
cent less  than  in  1981.  The  government  also  increased  prices  steeply. 
Hungary's  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan  (1981-85)  called  for  greater  auster- 
ity, efficiency,  and  profitability,  and  it  forecast  growth  of  14  per- 
cent to  17  percent  over  the  previous  plan  period.  The  economy, 
however,  grew  by  only  7  percent.  Industrial  production  rose  only 
12  percent,  far  below  the  planned  growth  of  19  to  22  percent. 
Agricultural  output  rose  12  percent  over  the  previous  plan  period, 
while  the  Hungarians'  real  per  capita  income  increased  7  to  8  per- 
cent. Planners  targeted  exports  to  increase  by  37  to  39  percent  and 
imports  by  18  to  19  percent;  exports,  however,  rose  only  27  per- 
cent, while  imports  increased  merely  6  percent. 

The  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan,  1986-90 

In  the  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan  period  (1986-90),  the  leadership 
expected  the  economy  to  supply  consumers  with  a  greater  assort- 
ment of  foodstuffs,  to  improve  the  country's  balance  of  payments 
by  raising  exports,  and  to  increase  productivity  and  profitability. 
Planners  called  for  the  net  material  product  to  grow  by  15  to  17 
percent  over  the  1985  level.  The  plan  also  called  for  industrial 


162 


The  Economy 


production  to  rise  by  14  to  16  percent  over  the  1981-85  plan  period; 
agricultural  output  to  rise  7  to  10  percent;  domestic  consumption, 
13  to  16  percent;  real  per  capita  income,  9  to  1 1  percent;  and  both 
imports  and  exports,  16  to  18  percent. 

In  1986  Hungary's  national  income  grew  by  only  0.5  percent, 
far  short  of  the  planned  2.3  to  2.7  percent.  Both  industrial  produc- 
tion, which  rose  1.8  percent,  and  agricultural  production,  which 
increased  1  percent,  were  far  short  of  planned  levels.  At  the  same 
time,  domestic  consumption  jumped  3  percent,  consumer  prices 
increased  5.3  percent,  and  per  capita  real  income  rose  0.7  percent. 
Investment  grew  by  5.1  percent,  the  maximum  envisaged  in  the 
plan.  Compared  with  the  previous  year,  Hungary's  imports  in  1986 
rose  by  2.5  percent,  while  exports  fell  by  2  percent. 

In  1987  national  income  grew  as  planned  by  about  2  percent. 
Industrial  production  rose  by  3.7  percent,  higher  than  the  planned 
2  to  2.5  percent,  but  bad  weather  caused  agricultural  output  to 
fall  far  short  of  the  1986-90  plan  target.  In  1987  investment  grew 
by  6  percent,  approximately  six  times  the  planned  amount,  while 
per  capita  income  remained  at  the  1986  level.  The  government  in- 
creased prices  on  energy  and  foodstuffs  sharply  in  1987  and  in- 
creased prices  on  53  percent  of  the  items  sold  in  the  country  in 
January  1988.  The  consumer  price  index  for  the  first  eight  months 
of  1988  was  16  percent  higher  than  for  the  same  period  in  1987, 
while  the  official  inflation  rate  was  17.7  percent.  The  government 
also  devalued  the  forint  an  average  of  13  percent  against  Western 
currencies  in  1987. 

Hungary  has  enjoyed  favorable  treatment  from  international  cap- 
ital markets  despite  disappointing  growth  and  continued  deterio- 
ration in  external  accounts.  At  least  one  author  has  pointed  out 
that  Western  banks  have  shown  the  greatest  confidence  in  coun- 
tries such  as  Hungary  that  have  good  debt- servicing  records,  regard- 
less of  the  countries'  economic  problems.  In  the  latter  half  of  the 
1980s,  Japanese  banks  increased  their  loan  portfolio  and  sought 
to  make  low-risk  loans  to  East  European  countries,  particularly 
Hungary.  Hungary  took  on  loans  to  restructure  its  industry,  reno- 
vate power  stations,  implement  its  energy  rationalization  program, 
upgrade  its  telecommunications  system,  and  finance  foreign  trade. 

The  current  value  of  Hungarian  exports  declined  between  1984 
and  1986,  and  the  country  ran  a  US$548  million  trade  deficit  in 
1986  followed  by  a  US$390  million  deficit  in  1987.  As  a  result  of 
a  deteriorating  convertible-currency  current  account,  Hungary's 
debt  more  than  doubled  in  two  years  from  US$8.6  billion  in  1985 
to  US$18  billion  in  December  1987,  and  the  country's  ratio  of  debt 
to  convertible-currency  exports  reached  338  percent  by  1986.  In

Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

May  1988,  the  government  signed  a  US$350  million  standby  credit 
agreement  with  the  IMF  and  announced  strict  austerity  measures. 
In  the  first  nine  months  of  1988,  Hungary's  convertible-currency 
trade  netted  a  US$200  million  surplus,  rebounding  from  the 
US$470  million  deficit  it  showed  in  the  same  period  in  1987.  The 
surplus  marked  the  first  time  since  1981  that  Hungary's  foreign 
trade  with  developed  countries  was  balanced. 

In  1989  the  government  sought  to  achieve  large  trade  surpluses 
with  convertible-currency  markets  that  would  enable  the  country 
to  repay  its  foreign  debt  and  import  raw  materials  and  technology. 
Hungary  could  create  those  surpluses  only  by  importing  more  raw 
materials  or  using  existing  resources  more  efficiently.  Hungary's 
major  supplier,  the  Soviet  Union,  was  experiencing  shortfalls  in 
oil  and  other  raw-materials  production  that  were  forcing  it  to  slow 
and  even  reduce  exports.  Thus,  Hungary  again  was  forced  to  turn 
to  convertible-currency  markets  to  secure  additional  raw  materials. 
Because  neither  Hungary  nor  the  Comecon  countries  generally  had 
the  technology  and  know-how  that  were  necessary  to  improve  effi- 
ciency and  increase  the  output  of  products  marketable  in  the  West, 
Hungary  also  had  to  turn  to  the  West  for  technology.  The  leader- 
ship understood  that  realizing  the  benefits  of  economic  relations 
with  the  West  required  significant  further  improvement  of  the  eco- 
nomic system.  At  the  Thirteenth  Party  Congress  in  March  1985, 
the  leadership  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to  continue  economic  re- 
forms that  promised  to  improve  efficiency  and  enhance  the  com- 
petitiveness of  Hungary's  exports.  In  the  last  years  of  the  Kadar 
era,  the  government  had  enacted  many  such  reform  measures,  but 
the  implementation  and  enforcement  of  these  measures  were  un- 
even. With  the  emergence  of  a  new  leadership  under  Karoly  Grosz 
in  1988,  Hungary  appeared  poised  to  enact  and  implement  more 
dramatic  reforms,  including  political  changes,  that  could  radically 
alter  the  country's  economic  life  in  the  1990s. 

Hungary's  economic  reforms  proceeded  so  rapidly  in  the  1980s 
that  works  on  the  country's  economic  system  have  become  out- 
dated shortly  after  appearing  in  print.  The  most  comprehen- 
sive description  of  Hungary's  economic  reforms  available  is  Paul 
Marer's  "Economic  Reform  in  Hungary"  in  East  European  Econo- 
mies: Slow  Growth  in  the  1980s,  a  publication  of  the  United  States 
Congress.  Marer's  East-West  Technology  Transfer:  Study  of  Hungary 
also  examines  Hungary's  economic  reforms  and  provides  detailed 
analyses  of  Hungary's  major  economic  sectors  and  its  trade  with

the  Comecon  countries  and  the  West.  Janos  Kornai's  article  "The 
Hungarian  Reform  Process:  Visions,  Hopes,  and  Reality"  pro- 
vides a  sober  assessment  of  the  reforms  by  a  leading  Hungarian 
economist.  Also  interesting  are  Paul  Hare's  "Industrial  Develop- 
ment of  Hungary  since  World  War  II"  and  "The  Beginnings  of

Chapter  4.  Government  and  Politics

A  small-town  judge,  1916 


THE  POLITICAL  SYSTEM  of  the  Hungarian  People's  Repub- 
lic, like  others  in  Eastern  Europe,  drew  heavily  upon  a  model  first 
established  in  the  Soviet  Union.  The  leading  political  institution 
in  the  state  was  the  ruling  communist  party,  in  this  case  the  Hun- 
garian Socialist  Workers'  Party.  This  monolithic,  centralized  party 
determined  the  basic  economic,  political,  and  social  policies  for  the 
country  as  a  whole,  and  the  government  implemented  the  party's 
decisions. 

The  Constitution,  ratified  in  1949  and  amended  considerably 
in  1972,  grants  political  and  economic  rights  to  the  people, 
prescribes  civic  duties,  and  establishes  the  institutions  of  govern- 
ment. According  to  the  Constitution,  the  National  Assembly  (the 
parliament)  holds  supreme  authority  in  the  state.  In  fact,  the 
Presidential  Council,  a  standing  body  of  the  National  Assembly 
that  combined  legislative  and  executive  functions,  assumed  most 
of  the  duties  of  the  National  Assembly  and  those  of  a  chief  of  state. 
The  National  Assembly,  however,  did  provide  a  vehicle  for  ex- 
panded political  participation.  A  1983  amendment  to  the  Consti- 
tution mandated  multicandidate  elections  for  most  seats  in  the 
National  Assembly.  The  Council  of  Ministers — the  executive  arm 
of  the  government — had  primary  responsibility  for  the  economy. 
Within  the  party,  the  rank-and-file  members  had  virtually  no  in- 
fluence over  decision  making.  The  permanent  party  bureaucracy, 
headed  by  the  Politburo  and  administered  by  the  Secretariat,  ex- 
ercised supreme  power  within  the  party.  These  organs  made  pol- 
icy for  the  party,  enforced  discipline,  and  regulated  admissions. 
Middle-level  organs  managed  policy  on  the  county  and  district 
levels.  Basic  Organizations — on  the  lowest  rung  of  the  party 
hierarchy — carried  out  party  activities  in  economic  enterprises.  The 
Patriotic  People's  Front  served  under  the  auspices  of  the  party; 
this  mass  organization  involved  the  citizenry  in  carrying  out  deci- 
sions made  by  the  party.  The  mass  media  also  served  as  instru- 
ments to  generate  popular  support  for  the  party's  policies. 

In  May  1988,  Karoly  Grosz  succeeded  Janos  Kadar  as  general 
secretary  of  the  party.  Kadar  had  been  leader  of  the  party  since 
the  Soviet  invasion  of  1956.  Mounting  economic  problems  and 
general  dissatisfaction  with  the  pace  of  political  reform  led  to  the 
ouster  of  Kadar  at  the  party's  Third  Party  Conference. 

Hungary's  foreign  policy  positions  generally  coincided  with  those 
of  the  Soviet  Union.  Since  1986  these  countries  have  supported 


169

each  other's  reform  efforts.  Nevertheless,  Hungary  displeased  the 
Soviet  Union  with  its  efforts  to  establish  an  independent  role  for 
small-  and  medium-sized  states  in  international  affairs  and  to  ob- 
tain Western  economic  assistance  to  help  modernize  its  economy. 
Discord  also  emerged  between  Hungary  and  Romania — ostensibly 
another  fraternal  ally — over  the  latter 's  oppression  of  its  Hungar- 
ian minority. 

Constitutional  Development 

The  theoretical  foundations  of  Marxist-Leninist  constitutions 
differ  from  those  underlying  Western,  democratic  constitutions. 
The  latter  are  fundamentally  prescriptive:  they  define  a  set  of  po- 
litical relations  between  government  and  people  that  ought  to  exist. 
By  contrast,  Marxist-Leninist  constitutions  attempt  to  reflect  reality 
by  describing  an  existing  set  of  political  relationships.  As  these  po- 
litical relationships  evolve  over  time,  the  regime  alters  the  consti- 
tution to  reflect  these  changes.  The  Hungarian  Constitution  serves 
several  political  purposes.  It  attempts  to  mobilize  the  populace  in 
support  of  the  regime's  goals.  The  Preamble  of  the  Constitution 
formally  calls  upon  the  people  to  promote  the  construction  of  so- 
cialism and  communism.  In  addition,  the  Constitution  demands 
that  the  most  loyal  sections  of  the  population  advance  the  regime's 
goals  through  greater  efforts  and  initiative.  The  Preamble  also  offers 
justifications  for  the  regime's  existence  by  describing  the  histori- 
cal past  that  led  to  Marxist- Leninist  rule. 

The  Constitution  does,  however,  bear  some  similarity  to  demo- 
cratic constitutions.  Like  Western  constitutions,  the  Hungarian  Con- 
stitution establishes  the  rights  and  duties  of  the  citizenry,  although 
it  devotes  more  attention  to  the  latter  than  democratic  constitutions. 
In  addition,  the  Constitution  specifies  the  institutions  of  government 
and  the  relations  among  them.  It  is,  however,  much  more  detailed 
in  this  regard  than  most  democratic  constitutions. 

The  Constitutional  Law  Council,  formed  in  1983,  had  some 
power  to  enforce  observance  of  constitutional  principles.  The  coun- 
cil, a  fifteen-member  body  subordinate  to  the  National  Assembly, 
monitored  decrees,  laws,  and  resolutions  issued  by  government  bod- 
ies to  ensure  their  conformity  with  the  Constitution. 

Constitution  of  1949 

In  June  1948,  the  Hungarian  Workers'  Party  (on  November  1, 
1956,  renamed  the  Hungarian  Socialist  Workers'  Party — HSWP) 
sought  to  legitimate  the  fundamental  changes  that  had  taken  place 
in  the  state,  the  economy,  and  the  society  and  directed  the  govern- 
ment's Council  of  Ministers  to  begin  work  on  a  constitution.  The 


170 


Government  and  Politics 


Council  of  Ministers  formed  a  Drafting  Committee,  which  sub- 
mitted a  proposed  Constitution  on  August  5,  1949.  The  National 
Assembly  ratified  the  Constitution  on  August  20,  1949,  thus  mak- 
ing a  new  national  holiday  that  coincided  with  the  traditional  holi- 
day of  the  feast  of  Saint  Stephen. 

The  regime  modeled  its  Constitution  on  the  1936  "Stalin"  con- 
stitution of  the  Soviet  Union.  As  of  the  late  1980s,  its  basic  fea- 
tures remained  in  effect,  although  the  regime  added  important 
amendments  in  1950,  1953,  1954,  1972  and  1983.  The  1949  Con- 
stitution contained  a  sociopolitical  program  dictated  by  the  Soviet 
Union  and  listed  the  achievements  of  Hungary's  "people's 
democracy"  (see  Rakosi's  Rule,  ch.  1).  The  government,  with  its 
ministerial  system,  collective  presidency,  and  powerless  legislature, 
resembled  the  Soviet  system  of  the  Stalinist  period.  The  Constitu- 
tion also  created  the  local  council  system  and  new  kinds  of  judicial 
institutions,  and  it  laid  the  groundwork  for  the  country's  system 
of  public  prosecutors  (see  State  Apparatus,  this  ch.).  Only  Chap- 
ter IX,  which  described  the  national  flag  and  coat  of  arms,  had 
a  specifically  Hungarian  character. 

Amendments  of  1972 

To  keep  pace  with  the  changes  that  had  taken  place  in  Hungary 
since  Kadar  became  first  secretary  of  the  HSWP  in  1956,  the  re- 
gime changed  every  chapter  of  the  Constitution  in  1972.  Accord- 
ing to  Hungarian  political  scientist  Istvan  Kovacs,  the  1972 
amendments  "brought  into  harmony  the  wording  of  the  Consti- 
tution and  the  socialist  transformation  of  the  country  between  1 949 
and  1972."  Thus,  the  Constitution  describes  the  achievements  of 
the  Kadar  regime.  It  also  provides  a  constitutional  basis  for  the 
regime's  efforts  to  gain  the  allegiance  of  all  Hungarians  by  replac- 
ing the  term  workers,  the  only  group  that  the  1949  Constitution  en- 
titled to  full  civil  rights,  with  the  term  citizens.  The  changes  in  1972 
signaled  a  break  with  Hungary's  Stalinist  past  and  the  beginning 
of  a  new,  more  benevolent  phase  in  regime-society  relations. 

The  Constitution,  as  amended  in  1972,  plays  several  important 
roles  in  Hungarian  political  life.  Most  important,  the  Constitu- 
tion provides  justifications  for  the  emergence  and  development  of 
the  regime  itself,  a,s  well  as  for  the  political  forces  that  shaped  its 
character.  The  Preamble  refers  to  the  Marxist- Leninist  regime  as 
the  product  of  more  than  1 ,000  years  of  Hungarian  history,  thereby 
linking  it  with  Hungarian  tradition.  It  also  draws  on  the  heritage 
of  the  Hungarian  Soviet  Republic  of  1919,  thus  attempting  to  cre- 
ate a  socialist  state  tradition  in  Hungary  and  link  itself  to  that  tra- 
dition (see  Political  and  Economic  Life,  1905-19,  ch.  1). 


171 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


In  justifying  the  regime,  the  Constitution  attempts  to  establish 
the  legitimacy  of  the  political  system.  The  Constitution  defines  the 
Hungarian  People's  Republic  as  a  socialist  state  in  which  all  power 
belongs  to  the  working  people.  It  labels  the  Patriotic  People's  Front 
(PPF)  as  a  movement  uniting  all  social  groups  for  the  resolution 
of  political,  economic,  and  cultural  problems.  Chapter  I,  Article 
15,  establishes  the  orientation  of  Hungary's  foreign  policy  by  stat- 
ing that  the  country  forms  part  of  the  world  socialist  system  and 
seeks  to  develop  its  friendship  with  other  socialist  states.  Finally, 
Chapter  IX  of  the  Constitution  defines  visual  symbols  for  the  Hun- 
garian People's  Republic  by  describing  the  coat  of  arms  and  the 
flag  of  the  state  and  by  locating  the  country's  capital  in  Budapest. 

In  establishing  the  country's  political  system,  the  Constitution 
fixes  the  HSWP  as  the  leading  force  in  society.  Although  the  Con- 
stitution does  not  formally  proscribe  other  political  parties,  neither 
does  it  provide  for  their  existence.  On  November  10,  1988,  however, 
the  Council  of  Ministers  took  the  first  in  a  series  of  steps  required 
to  legalize  the  existence  of  other  parties  when  it  approved  draft  laws 
on  the  rights  of  assembly  and  association.  The  National  Assembly 
approved  these  new  laws  on  January  11,  1989.  According  to  the 
new  laws,  county  courts  were  to  register  these  associations  and  could 
not  refuse  to  register  them  if  they  met  the  law's  requirements.  Thus, 
private  individuals,  legal  entities,  and  unofficial  groups  could  set 
up  political  parties  if  their  programs  observed  the  law.  A  separate 
statute  was  to  deal  with  matters  such  as  registration,  supervision, 
and  dissolution  of  the  parties.  A  new  constitution,  which  was  to 
be  ready  for  ratification  in  1990,  would  determine  the  role  and  status 
of  political  parties  other  than  the  HSWP  in  society.  Taking  ad- 
vantage of  this  change  in  the  political  atmosphere,  other  political 
parties,  which  had  been  disbanded  in  the  late  1940s,  began  to  re- 
emerge  in  the  late  1980s.  For  example,  the  Independent  Small- 
holders' Party  announced  it  would  resume  its  activities.  The  Social 
Democratic  Party  and  the  National  Peasant  Party  also  began  to 
reorganize  (see  Coalition  Government  and  Communist  Takeover, 
ch.  1). 

Having  provided  several  kinds  of  justifications  for  the  regime's 
existence,  the  Constitution  proceeds  to  establish  the  institutions  of 
government.  The  Constitution  delineates  the  powers  of  the  Na- 
tional Assembly,  the  Presidential  Council,  the  Council  of  Ministers, 
and  the  local  councils.  The  Constitution  establishes  a  judicial 
system  made  up  of  the  Supreme  Court  and  a  series  of  lower  courts. 
The  Constitution  requires  the  National  Assembly  to  elect  a  prose- 
cutor general,  who  in  turn  appoints  prosecutors  at  local  levels. 


172 


Government  and  Politics 


Like  constitutions  in  the  West,  the  Hungarian  Constitution 
describes  civic  and  political  rights.  These  rights  include  the  guaran- 
tees of  equality  before  the  law  and  the  personal  freedom  and  in- 
violability of  the  citizenry;  liberty  of  conscience  and  freedom  of 
worship;  freedom  of  speech,  press,  and  assembly;  right  of  associa- 
tion; and  privacy  of  correspondence  and  the  home.  In  line  with 
the  Marxist-Leninist  ideology  of  the  regime,  the  Constitution  also 
guarantees  certain  social  and  economic  rights,  including  the  right 
to  leisure  time;  the  right  to  financial  support  for  old  age,  disease, 
and  disability;  and  the  right  to  education. 

The  Constitution,  however,  limits  citizens'  exercise  of  their  po- 
litical rights.  According  to  Chapter  VII,  Article  64,  the  Constitu- 
tion guarantees  the  rights  of  speech,  press,  and  assembly  "in  a 
manner  conforming  to  the  interests  of  socialism  and  the  people." 
This  clause  allows  the  government  to  ban  any  activities  it  considers 
detrimental  to  its  interests.  Equally  important,  Chapter  VII,  Ar- 
ticle 69,  states  that  the  "fundamental  duty"  of  the  citizenry  is  to 
"protect  the  property  of  the  people,  to  consolidate  social  owner- 
ship, to  increase  the  economic  strength  of  the  Hungarian  People's 
Republic  ...  to  consolidate  the  order  of  society."  Although  in  1988 
the  United  States  Department  of  State  found  that  Hungarians  en- 
joyed relatively  more  liberties  than  their  counterparts  in  other  coun- 
tries of  Eastern  Europe,  duties  to  the  state  continued  to  take 
precedence  over  rights  contained  in  the  Constitution.  The  regime 
did  not  treat  as  inalienable  the  rights  held  by  the  people. 

Furthermore,  socioeconomic  rights  contained  in  the  Constitu- 
tion have  acted  not  only  as  an  economic  safety  net  but  also  as  a 
source  of  oppression  for  the  people.  For  example,  the  right  to  work 
not  only  guaranteed  employment  but  also  allowed  the  regime  to 
enforce  compulsory  employment  for  all  adult  males  and  all  single 
females  because  the  regime  could  best  exercise  power  over  the 
populace  while  they  were  at  work.  The  right  to  leisure  time  allowed 
the  regime  to  control  the  forms  of  entertainment  that  citizens  could 
enjoy.  And  the  right  to  primary  and  secondary  education  has  meant 
little  more  than  the  obligation  to  listen  to  regime- sponsored  efforts 
at  political  indoctrination. 

Constitutional  Law  Council 

In  1989  the  Constitutional  Law  Council  had  the  power  to  moni- 
tor constitutional  life  in  Hungary,  note  possible  violations  of  the 
Constitution,  and  initiate  procedures  to  eliminate  laws,  decrees, 
and  regulations  that  failed  to  conform  to  the  Constitution.  The 
National  Assembly  elected  the  fifteen  members  of  the  Constitu- 
tional Law  Council,  which  included  National  Assembly  delegates, 


173 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


the  minister  of  justice,  the  president  of  the  Supreme  Court,  the 
prosecutor  general,  and  the  chairman  of  the  People's  Control  Com- 
mittee (see  State  Apparatus,  this  ch.).  The  council  was  subordinate 
to  the  National  Assembly  and,  unlike  the  United  States  Supreme 
Court,  was  not  an  independent  body  for  judicial  review. 

In  amending  the  Constitution  to  establish  the  Constitutional  Law 
Council  in  1983,  the  regime  responded  to  demands  of  the  public 
to  promote  the  rule  of  law  and  to  requests  of  constitutional  law- 
yers to  systematize  laws,  decrees,  and  regulations  promulgated  by 
the  ministries.  The  council  used  reports  of  violations  from  "reli- 
able entities,"  which  included  government  agencies,  the  National 
Assembly,  and  the  county  and  district  councils.  If  the  Constitu- 
tional Law  Council  found  that  a  law,  decree,  or  regulation  vio- 
lated the  Constitution,  the  council  mediated  between  the  body  that 
lodged  the  complaint  and  the  government  organ  that  issued  the 
law,  decree,  or  regulation.  The  council  could  suspend  acts  it  deemed 
unconstitutional,  but  it  could  not  repeal  them. 

Individual  citizens  lacked  direct  access  to  the  Constitutional  Law 
Council.  In  fact,  only  government  organs  in  a  position  to  violate 
the  Constitution — the  National  Assembly,  the  Presidential  Coun- 
cil, the  ministries,  and  the  county  and  district  councils — had  the  right 
to  initiate  inquiries  by  this  body.  If  a  person  submitted  a  case  to 
the  Constitutional  Law  Council,  the  council  referred  that  person 
to  the  government  organ  best  able  to  represent  the  case.  However, 
authorized  organs  represented  only  their  own  viewpoints,  not  those 
of  individuals.  Furthermore,  no  religious  body  had  access  to  the  coun- 
cil; therefore,  issues  concerning  church- state  relations  never  appeared 
for  review.  In  effect,  the  Constitutional  Law  Council  was  answera- 
ble only  to  governing  organs,  not  to  the  Hungarian  people. 

State  Apparatus 

The  political  system  of  Hungary  bore  some  similarity  to  a 
parliamentary  form  of  government.  In  principle,  power  in  the 
government  emanated  from  the  National  Assembly,  which  elected 
its  own  leadership — the  Presidential  Council  and  its  chairman,  who 
served  as  chief  of  state — and  the  Council  of  Ministers,  which  formed 
the  government  (see  fig.  8).  The  state  apparatus,  however,  was 
not  the  center  of  political  power  in  Hungary.  The  government  mere- 
ly executed  policies  designed  by  the  HSWP.  Within  the  govern- 
ment itself,  power  resided  in  the  Council  of  Ministers  and  the 
Presidential  Council.  The  National  Assembly  merely  ratified  de- 
cisions made  elsewhere. 

Government  life  centered  on  the  Council  of  Ministers.  The  re- 
gime established  the  Council  of  Ministers  in  the  immediate  postwar 


174 


Government  and  Politics 


period  using  the  Soviet  Council  of  Ministers  as  a  model.  The 
primary  function  of  the  Council  of  Ministers  was  to  administer  the 
economy.  It  also  had  the  power  to  pass  some  legislation;  the  minis- 
tries could  make  laws  in  their  own  jurisdictions. 

The  Presidential  Council — the  collective  chief  of  state — was  mod- 
eled after  the  Soviet  Union's  Presidium  of  the  Supreme  Soviet. 
The  council,  headed  by  its  chairman,  combined  legislative  and  ex- 
ecutive functions.  In  fact,  the  Presidential  Council  passed  most  of 
the  country's  legislation. 

The  HSWP  effectively  exercised  control  over  the  government. 
In  1989  all  members  of  the  Council  of  Ministers  and  most  mem- 
bers of  the  Presidential  Council  were  party  members  and  served 
on  such  party  bodies  as  the  Central  Committee  and  the  Politburo 
(see  Party  Structure,  this  ch.).  As  party  leaders,  government  offi- 
cials formulated  economic,  political,  and  social  policies.  These  offi- 
cials were  subject  to  the  norms  of  democratic  centralism,  which 
required  them  to  carry  out  the  directives  of  the  HSWP  or  face  party 
discipline  (see  Democratic  Centralism,  this  ch.).  Equally  impor- 
tant, the  party  exercised  control  over  these  governmental  institu- 
tions through  its  power  of  nomenklatura  (see  Glossary),  a  list  of  party 
and  government  positions  for  which  the  party  had  power  to  make 
appointments.  The  HSWP's  Basic  Organizations  ensured  that  the 
staff  of  each  ministry  adhered  to  party  policies  on  a  day-to-day  basis. 

In  the  1980s,  the  regime  opened  up  the  political  system  to  a  greater 
degree  of  popular  participation.  Although  multicandidate  elections 
had  been  permitted  since  the  late  1960s,  a  1983  amendment  to  the 
Constitution  made  mandatory  the  multicandidate  elections  for  the 
National  Assembly  and  the  local  councils.  However,  these  elections 
took  place  under  the  auspices  of  the  PPF,  which  guaranteed  that 
candidates  accepted  its  program.  A  national  list  of  candidates  to  the 
National  Assembly,  who  ran  unopposed,  did  ensure  the  election  of 
party  and  government  luminaries,  as  well  as  of  other  figures  of  na- 
tional importance.  Nevertheless,  in  the  1985  elections  many  indepen- 
dent candidates,  who  were  not  among  the  PPF's  original  slate  of 
nominees,  succeeded  in  gaining  seats  in  the  National  Assembly  and 
the  local  councils.  Significantly,  although  the  regime  structured  the 
elections  to  favor  its  candidates,  until  mid- 1989  the  Hungarian  elec- 
toral system  was  the  most  democratic  in  Eastern  Europe. 

The  local  councils  had  very  little  power.  Ironically,  their  chief 
importance  lay  in  administering  those  services,  such  as  education, 
housing,  and  food  supply,  that  had  the  greatest  impact  on  peo- 
ple's lives. 

Like  other  Marxist-Leninist  regimes  in  the  late  1980s,  Hungary 
lacked  an  independent  judiciary.  The  Supreme  Court,  together  with

Government  and  Politics 


a  system  of  lower  courts  at  the  county  and  district  levels,  had  few 
duties  and  little  power.  The  prosecutor  general  and  his  subordinates 
at  the  local  levels  represented  the  state  in  prosecuting  persons  ac- 
cused of  a  crime.  However,  the  law  also  obligated  these  officials 
to  protect  the  rights  of  the  citizenry  and  ensure  a  fair  trial  for  the 
accused. 

Council  of  Ministers 

According  to  the  Constitution,  the  Council  of  Ministers  guided, 
influenced,  and  controlled  the  entire  construction  of  the  economic, 
political,  and  social  system  of  socialism.  The  council  had  primary 
authority  over  economic  decision  making;  it  developed  and  im- 
plemented the  regime's  economic  plans.  Beginning  in  1968  with  the 
introduction  of  the  New  Economic  Mechanism  (NEM),  an  effort 
to  relax  central  controls  over  the  economy,  the  Council  of  Ministers 
played  a  particularly  critical  role  within  the  political  system  (see  Eco- 
nomic Policy  and  Performance  1945-85,  ch.  3). 

In  1989  the  Council  of  Ministers  consisted  of  a  chairman  (the 
prime  minister),  two  deputy  prime  ministers,  twelve  ministers,  the 
chairman  of  the  National  Planning  Authority,  the  chairman  of  the 
People's  Control  Committee,  and  the  chairman  of  the  State  Plan- 
ning Committee.  The  number  of  ministries  has  varied  over  time. 
In  1989  they  included  agriculture  and  food,  culture  and  education, 
defense,  environmental  protection  and  water  management,  finance, 
foreign  affairs,  health  and  social  affairs,  industry,  internal  affairs, 
justice,  communications,  construction,  and  trade.  Other  agencies 
also  operated  under  the  auspices  of  the  Council  of  Ministers  and 
in  1989  included  the  Central  Statistical  Office,  the  Hungarian  Na- 
tional Bank,  the  National  Price  Office,  the  State  Office  for  Church 
Affairs,  the  State  Office  for  Youth  and  Sports,  the  Postal  Service, 
and  the  State  Wage  and  Labor  Office. 

Although  the  Council  of  Ministers  devoted  primary  attention  to 
the  economy,  according  to  the  Constitution  its  first  responsibility 
was  to  "safeguard  and  guarantee  the  political  and  social  order  of 
the  state  and  the  rights  of  the  citizens."  In  1989  other  duties  in- 
cluded enforcing  laws  and  decree-laws,  supporting  scientific  and  cul- 
tural development,  establishing  a  system  for  social  and  health 
services,  and  concluding  and  approving  international  agreements. 
According  to  Chapter  III,  Article  34,  of  the  Constitution,  a  special 
act  of  the  National  Assembly  may  assign  other  duties  to  the  Coun- 
cil of  Ministers  in  addition  to  those  described  in  the  Constitution. 

In  1989  ministers  had  no  fixed  term  of  office.  Ministers  served 
at  the  behest  of  the  National  Assembly  and  could,  upon  recom- 
mendation of  the  party,  be  recalled  at  any  time. 


177 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

Hungarian  political  scientist  Mihaly  Bihari  has  argued  that  the 
Council  of  Ministers  and  the  ministerial  system  institutionalized 
society's  economic  interests  and  their  representation  within  the 
government.  The  ministerial  departments  made  the  most  impor- 
tant decisions  on  the  economy  because  they  had  the  requisite 
knowledge  at  their  disposal  as  a  result  of  their  day-to-day  adminis- 
tration of  issues  under  their  jurisdiction.  Although  the  National 
Assembly  and,  most  often,  the  Presidential  Council  issued  laws, 
regulations,  and  decrees,  the  ministries  developed  and  selected  the 
suggested  proposals.  Bargaining  among  ministries  and  within  the 
Council  of  Ministers  resolved  policy  differences  on  these  proposals. 
All  interested  ministries  had  the  opportunity  to  modify  these 
proposals  so  that  it  was  possible  to  discern  the  interests  and  politi- 
cal demands  of  the  social  groupings  represented  by  each  ministry. 

The  People's  Control  Committee  functioned  under  the  direc- 
tion of  the  Council  of  Ministers.  The  committee  supervised  a  hier- 
archy of  similar  committees  at  the  local  levels.  The  Presidential 
Council  appointed  members  of  the  People's  Control  Committee, 
but  volunteers  staffed  most  of  the  positions  at  the  local  levels.  The 
committees  oversaw  the  operations  of  government  organs,  social 
organizations,  and  economic  enterprises  to  ensure  proper  manage- 
ment and  legality. 

Presidential  Council 

In  1989  the  Constitution  described  the  Presidential  Council  as 
subordinate  to  the  National  Assembly  and  superordinate  to  the 
Council  of  Ministers.  However,  the  Presidential  Council  was  in 
fact  the  highest  state  organ  and,  because  the  National  Assembly 
met  so  infrequentiy,  it  acted  as  an  ersatz  parliament.  In  early  1989, 
the  chairman  of  the  Presidential  Council  was  Bruno  F.  Straub,  at 
the  time  the  only  noncommunist  chief  of  state  in  Eastern  Europe. 

The  Presidential  Council  had  combined  legislative  and  execu- 
tive powers.  It  set  the  date  for  elections  to  the  National  Assembly, 
convened  the  National  Assembly,  initiated  legislation,  and  decreed 
national  plebiscites.  The  Presidential  Council  also  contributed  to 
the  normal  functioning  of  state  life  by  concluding  and  ratifying 
treaties,  receiving  the  credentials  of  foreign  ambassadors,  electing 
professional  judges,  and  conferring  awards  and  titles.  The  Presiden- 
tial Council  supervised  the  local  councils  by  setting  the  date  for 
council  elections,  ensuring  the  rights  of  the  councils,  and  dissolv- 
ing those  councils  that  infringed  on  the  Constitution.  When  the 
National  Assembly  was  not  in  session,  the  Presidential  Council  as- 
sumed the  powers  of  a  parliament.  In  fact,  the  Presidential  Coun- 
cil performed  most  of  the  government's  legislative  work.  (The 


178 


Government  and  Politics 

National  Assembly  usually  approved  the  decree-laws  of  the  Presi- 
dential Council  at  its  next  session.)  In  the  event  of  war  or  threat 
to  the  security  of  the  state,  the  Presidential  Council  could  estab- 
lish a  National  Defense  Council  with  extraordinary  powers. 

In  addition  to  these  legislative  and  executive  duties,  the  mem- 
bers of  the  Presidential  Council  undertook  a  number  of  other  tasks. 
They  participated  in  the  committee  work  of  the  National  Assem- 
bly (see  National  Assembly,  this  ch.),  held  meetings  with  consti- 
tuents, and  handled  complaints  about  the  bureaucracy  from  the 
citizenry.  Members  could  represent  Hungary  abroad  and  hold 
meetings  with  foreign  delegations.  They  also  visited  county  and 
district  governments  and  participated  in  awards  ceremonies. 

In  1989  the  secretariat  of  the  Presidential  Council  consisted  of 
a  division  for  justice,  which  handled  pardons  for  criminals;  a  divi- 
sion for  civil  proceedings;  a  division  for  law;  and  a  division  for 
honors  and  decorations.  These  divisions  had  their  own  organi- 
zational statutes.  The  secretariat  lacked  a  permanent  organiza- 
tional structure  because  new  divisions  could  be  created  according 
to  need. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  Presidential  Council  remained  a  rather 
secretive  body.  The  media  did  not  publish  its  discussions  and  de- 
bates. The  Presidential  Council  also  did  not  announce  its  voting 
procedures. 

In  1989  the  Presidential  Council  consisted  of  a  chairman,  two 
deputy  chairmen,  a  secretary,  and  seventeen  members  at  large. 
The  National  Assembly  elected  these  members  from  among  its  own 
delegates,  although  the  Central  Committee  of  the  HSWP  actually 
made  the  choices.  Both  party  members  and  nonparty  members 
could  be  selected  for  the  Presidential  Council — including  its  leader- 
ship positions — although  party  members  generally  predominated. 
Three  rules  seemed  to  have  governed  the  Central  Committee's 
selections:  the  council  had  to  be  a  representative  body  mirroring 
the  occupational  and  social  structure  of  the  population,  it  had  to 
contain  a  number  of  well-known  people  in  public  life,  and  it  had 
to  include  several  party  leaders.  The  Presidential  Council  thus  was 
made  up  of  party  leaders,  as  well  as  representatives  of  social  and 
political  groups,  including  national  minorities,  peasants,  and 
women.  Church  leaders  who  supported  the  regime  also  were 
selected.  A  few  members  were  nominated  because  of  their  policy 
expertise  in  a  given  field.  For  example,  because  the  secretary  not 
only  supervised  the  secretariat  of  the  council  but  also  helped  to  de- 
termine its  political  line  and  handle  its  day-to-day  affairs,  that  official 
usually  had  had  previous  experience  in  the  personnel  administra- 
tion of  the  HSWP.

National  Assembly 

The  Constitution  designates  the  National  Assembly  as  the 
supreme  organ  of  state  power.  In  reality  the  parliament  played  a 
limited  role  in  the  government.  Until  1989,  the  352-member 
unicameral  National  Assembly  met  only  three  or  four  times  a  year 
in  sessions  that  lasted  no  longer  than  four  days  each.  In  addition 
to  electing  the  membership  of  state  and  government  bodies  nomi- 
nally subordinate  to  it,  the  National  Assembly  also  enacted  laws 
and  approved  the  five-year  economic  plans.  However,  from  1980 
through  1985  the  National  Assembly  passed  only  eighteen  bills, 
an  insignificant  number  compared  with  those  passed  by  the 
Presidential  Council  and  the  Council  of  Ministers.  In  the  late  1980s, 
party  leaders  openly  acknowledged  that  these  two  bodies  made  all 
the  important  decisions  and  that  the  National  Assembly  was  merely 
a  rubber  stamp. 

Delegates  to  the  National  Assembly  did  play  several  important 
roles.  They  contributed  to  the  plenary  discussions  of  the  parlia- 
ment, acted  as  members  of  the  county  groups,  served  their  consti- 
tuencies, and  participated  in  the  parliament's  standing  committees. 
Plenary  sessions  chiefly  concerned  local  problems  and  were  an  at- 
tempt to  use  the  parliament's  publicity  to  pressure  authorities  on 
the  distribution  of  funds.  Delegates  elected  from  each  county  formed 
county  groups  to  promote  the  interests  of  their  region.  Because  most 
counties  had  an  urban-rural  mix,  formation  of  a  common  policy 
outlook  was  difficult.  However,  inasmuch  as  Hungary  had  more 
agricultural  regions  than  industrial  regions,  agriculture  enjoyed 
predominance.  As  servants  of  their  constituencies,  delegates 
reported  on  their  activities  in  the  National  Assembly  and  attempted 
to  resolve  citizens'  complaints  against  the  bureaucracy. 

The  most  important  duties  of  the  delegates  concerned  their  work 
on  the  standing  committees  of  the  National  Assembly.  The  Na- 
tional Assembly  elected  in  1985,  in  addition  to  legal,  administra- 
tive, and  judicial  committees,  had  standing  committees  for 
construction  and  transport,  culture,  industry,  trade,  foreign  affairs, 
agriculture,  social  and  health  affairs,  infrastructural  development 
and  environmental  protection,  and  planning  and  budgeting.  During 
the  1980-85  convocation  of  the  National  Assembly,  221  out  of  the 
352  delegates  served  on  the  standing  committees,  which  met  about 
50  times  a  year.  The  committees  discussed  draft  laws  submitted 
by  the  Council  of  Ministers,  usually  proposing  only  small  changes 
in  the  text.  The  committees  did,  however,  have  the  power  to  re- 
ject the  drafts  at  this  stage.  In  the  1980s,  the  committees  also  actively 
supervised  the  implementation  of  laws.  A  parliamentary  presidency, 


180 


Government  and  Politics 


which  consisted  of  the  chairman  and  two  deputy  chairmen  aided 
by  a  small  bureau,  coordinated  the  work  of  the  committees. 

Elections  to  the  National  Assembly 

In  1983  the  government  instituted  a  new  electoral  system  for  the 
National  Assembly  and  local  councils  to  encourage  more  popular 
participation  in  governmental  affairs.  Before  1966  Hungary  had 
used  an  electoral  system  in  which  a  voter  could  vote  only  for  or 
against  the  official  slate  of  candidates.  In  1966  the  government  in- 
itiated election  procedures  that  made  the  nomination  of  more  than 
one  candidate  possible;  in  the  1971  elections,  49  districts  out  of 
352  nominated  two  or  more  candidates.  By  1981,  however,  the 
number  of  multicandidate  districts  declined  to  fifteen,  thus  caus- 
ing concern  within  the  party  leadership  and  eventually  triggering 
reform. 

In  1983  the  regime  instituted  a  new  electoral  system  for  several 
reasons.  British  authority  Bill  Lomax  has  written  that  Hungarian 
leaders  "felt  sufficient  confidence  that  by  granting  measured  degrees 
of  independence  and  autonomy  to  society,  they  could  win  not  just 
the  passivity  but  the  complicity  if  not  quite  the  loyalty  of  major 
sections  of  the  population."  Through  its  multicandidate  elections, 
the  regime  attempted  to  convince  the  populace  that  the  political 
system  was  essentially  democratic.  The  electoral  system  afforded 
the  government  the  opportunity  to  mobilize  people  in  support  of 
a  political  campaign  and  thereby  increase  their  political  awareness. 
Finally,  the  elections  provided  an  occasion  for  testing  the  HSWP's 
organizational  and  supervisory  abilities. 

The  new  rules  compelled  the  nomination  of  several  candidates 
in  single-member  districts.  Both  residents  of  the  district  and  work- 
ers employed  in  the  district  but  living  elsewhere  could  participate 
in  the  nomination  meetings.  At  the  meetings,  voters  could  ask  ques- 
tions of  the  candidates  and  comment  on  their  programs  with  sup- 
port or  objections.  The  PPF  organized  the  meetings  and  proposed 
the  candidates.  Nominations  could  also  be  submitted  by  other  so- 
cial and  political  organizations  or  persons  in  the  district.  All  candi- 
dates, however,  had  to  accept  the  PPF  program  to  be  eligible  for 
nomination.  Thus  the  procedure  favored  regime  candidates  and 
minimized  the  chances  for  independent  candidates.  For  a  candidate 
to  gain  nomination,  33.3  percent  of  the  persons  present  at  the  meet- 
ing had  to  cast  a  "yes"  vote.  If  no  candidate  received  the  required 
percentage,  another  nomination  meeting  was  held.  In  addition,  the 
rules  stipulated  that  the  number  of  nomination  meetings  equal  the 
number  of  candidates,  but  each  parliamentary  district  had  to  have 
at  least  two  candidates  and  therefore  two  meetings.  All  proposals

for  the  nomination  of  independent  candidates  had  to  be  resubmit- 
ted at  the  next  meeting.  The  rules  also  allowed  each  citizen  to  vote 
for  several  nominees.  Because  the  regime  could  use  the  PPF  to 
mobilize  large  numbers  of  people  against  undesirable  candidates, 
this  rule  discriminated  against  independent  nominees. 

The  efforts  of  the  dissident  Laszlo  Rajk  to  gain  nomination  il- 
lustrate the  barriers  faced  by  independent  nominees.  On  April  18, 
1985,  at  the  first  of  the  two  required  nomination  meetings  in  the 
southern  constituency  of  Budapest's  fifth  district,  Rajk  gained  the 
support  of  about  40  percent  of  the  223  people  present.  At  the  sec- 
ond electoral  meeting  on  April  22,  the  regime  attempted  to  thwart 
Rajk's  nomination.  HSWP  activists,  plainclothes  police,  and  fac- 
tory workers  filled  the  hall.  Rajk's  speech  raised  such  controver- 
sial issues  as  conscientious  objection  to  military  service,  the  fate 
of  the  environment,  and  the  problem  of  Hungarian  minorities 
abroad  (see  Relations  with  Other  Communist  Neighbors,  this  ch.). 
At  the  second  meeting,  only  about  27  percent  of  the  1,388  voters 
present  supported  Rajk. 

In  addition  to  the  obligatory  multiple  candidacies,  the  new 
electoral  system  called  for  the  establishment  of  a  national  list  of 
thirty-five  candidates  to  be  elected  without  opposition.  Politburo 
member  Mihaly  Korom  justified  the  national  list  by  arguing  that 
"important  interests  demand  the  representation  of  leading  perso- 
nalities" from  society,  culture,  science,  and  the  churches.  Korom 
maintained  that  the  "character  of  their  work,  the  province  of  their 
activities  go  far  beyond  the  boundaries  of  their  electoral  districts." 
The  law  was  successful  in  promoting  multiple  candidacies  through- 
out the  country.  In  addition,  some  independent  candidates  gained 
nomination  and  election.  Of  the  352  National  Assembly  consti- 
tuencies in  the  1985  election,  298  had  two  candidates  each,  50  had 
three  candidates  each,  and  4  had  four  candidates  each.  Most  of 
the  triple  and  quadruple  candidacies  occurred  in  Borsod-Abauj- 
Zemplen,  Fejer,  and  Pest  counties  and  in  Budapest.  Of  the  152 
people  who  were  not  originally  on  the  PPF  list  and  were  nominated 
from  the  floor,  78  received  the  necessary  one-third  votes  at  two 
or  more  nominating  meetings,  and  51  of  them  had  been  proposed 
in  addition  to  the  2  nominees  successfully  nominated  by  the  PPF. 

About  1.5  million  people,  or  20  percent  of  the  country's  eligible 
voters,  participated  in  the  nominating  meetings  for  the  1985  elec- 
tions to  the  National  Assembly  and  the  local  councils.  Approxi- 
mately 150,000  people  asked  to  speak  out  at  the  meetings  in  support 
of  the  proposed  candidates. 

In  the  general  election,  abstention  rates  were  high  by  East  Eu- 
ropean standards.  Turnout  in  the  whole  country  was  93.9  percent, 


184 


Government  and  Politics 


down  from  97  percent  in  1980.  The  turnout  in  Budapest  was  88.4 
percent.  The  number  of  valid  votes  cast  (votes  submitted  accord- 
ing to  the  rules)  was  94.6  percent;  in  Budapest  this  figure  was  92.3 
percent.  Negative  votes — votes  cast  against  all  candidates  on  the 
ballot — amounted  to  1.2  percent  of  valid  votes. 

Of  the  352  electoral  districts,  42  required  runoff  elections  be- 
cause no  candidate  could  muster  the  required  50  percent  plus  one 
of  the  valid  votes.  Another  eighty  constituencies  had  close  contests. 
Of  the  seventy-eight  independents  who  gained  nomination,  forty- 
three  won  seats  after  runoff  elections.  Nevertheless,  thirty- three 
of  these  forty-three  candidates  were  party  members.  The  propor- 
tion of  independent  candidates  was  quite  low,  but,  according  to 
American  political  scientist  Barnabas  Racz,  their  nomination 
marked  an  unprecedented  development  in  the  history  of  East 
European  elections. 

Although  the  1985  election  was  democratic  by  East  European 
standards,  Hungarian  dissidents  and  Western  commentators  pin- 
pointed several  troubling  features.  In  most  of  the  electoral  districts, 
the  two  PPF  candidates  were  the  only  nominees.  In  addition,  only 
the  priorities  of  the  candidates  differed,  not  their  programs.  The 
regime  subjected  campaign  literature  to  strict  copying  regulations, 
and  it  took  steps  to  limit  publicity  for  candidates.  Dissidents  main- 
tained that  the  procedures  favored  the  big  industrial  enterprises, 
which  packed  nomination  meetings  with  supporters  for  their 
preferred  candidates.  In  turn,  these  candidates,  once  elected,  formed 
parliamentary  lobbies  that  supported  increases  in  subsidies  for  the 
industries  to  which  they  owed  their  nomination. 

County  and  District  Government 

In  1989  district  government  resembled  that  on  the  national  level: 
a  popularly  elected  local  council  chose  an  executive  to  administer 
the  affairs  of  its  jurisdiction.  Communes  {kdzseg),  large  communes 
(nagykozseg),  cities,  and  districts  of  Budapest  elected  councils  on  this 
level.  District  councils  elected  the  county-level  councils,  which  also 
chose  an  executive. 

The  councils  served  as  legislatures  for  their  jurisdictions,  while 
a  chairman  and  an  executive  committee,  elected  from  the  ranks, 
carried  out  the  actual  administration  of  government  activities.  The 
executive  committee  on  the  county  level  supervised  the  work  of 
the  executive  committee  on  the  district  level.  In  turn,  the  Council 
of  Ministers  directed  the  work  of  the  county  executive  committees. 
The  chairmen  of  the  county  and  district  councils  sat  on  the  cor- 
responding executive  committees  of  the  HSWP  (see  Party  Struc- 
ture, this  ch.). 


185 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

Executive  committees  on  each  level  had  their  own  administra- 
tive apparatus  made  up  of  specialized  departments  to  manage 
government  activities  in  their  jurisdiction.  Within  their  sphere  of 
influence,  the  executive  committees  could  appoint  and  remove  the 
directors  of  branch  organizations  administering  these  services. 
However,  these  personnel  decisions  required  approval  by  the  ex- 
ecutive committee  at  the  county  level  or  by  the  Council  of  Ministers. 
In  addition,  when  the  executive  committee  appointed  local  offi- 
cials, it  had  to  take  into  account  the  standards  established  for  those 
positions  by  the  Council  of  Ministers.  The  Council  of  Ministers 
also  had  the  right  to  submit  its  own  nominees  for  positions  in  the 
district  and  county  administrations  (see  Council  of  Ministers,  this 
ch.). 

District  and  county  government  dealt  with  services  that  had  the 
most  immediate  impact  on  the  lives  of  the  citizenry:  education, 
housing,  day  care  facilities,  and  medical  care.  In  the  late  1980s, 
the  local  government  had  jurisdiction  over  90  percent  of  the 
preschool  and  day  care  facilities,  all  general  (elementary)  schools, 
most  middle  schools,  90  percent  of  government-owned  housing, 
80  percent  of  the  hospital  beds,  and  70  percent  of  the  libraries,  thea- 
ters, and  educational  centers.  The  national  government  had  direct 
control  over  areas  such  as  railroads,  waterways,  postal  and  fire  ser- 
vices, and  communications.  Local  councils  also  had  some  power 
in  passing  a  budget  for  their  jurisdiction  and  to  manage  its  exe- 
cution. 

In  the  late  1980s,  county  and  district  government  had  relatively 
large  authority  in  managing  the  local  economy.  About  14,000  en- 
terprises and  firms  meeting  the  needs  of  the  local  population  were 
under  their  jurisdiction.  The  law  allowed  local  governments  to  create 
these  enterprises.  The  national  government  also  permitted  local 
government  to  approve  the  plans  of  these  enterprises,  which  func- 
tioned mainly  in  the  service  sector. 

Since  1983  multicandidate  elections  to  the  district  councils  have 
been  mandatory.  In  the  1985  elections,  an  estimated  88,000  can- 
didates competed  for  the  42,734  district  seats.  About  5.4  percent 
of  district  constituencies  had  triple  candidacies,  and  0.2  percent 
had  quadruple  candidacies.  Reports  of  the  nomination  meetings 
indicated  an  average  participation  of  from  200  to  400  people,  a 
very  small  fraction  of  the  approximately  30,000  people  per  district. 
In  addition,  problems  emerged  in  many  districts.  In  Bacs-Kiskun 
County,  the  organizers  combined  the  meetings  of  the  twenty- 
seventh  and  twenty-eighth  council  districts  and  allowed  them  to 
vote  jointiy  for  each  other's  nominees.  The  PPF  nullified  the  results. 
In  Budapest  two  different  constituencies  nominated  the  same

person.  In  102  districts,  the  nominating  meetings  had  to  be 
repeated. 

Judicial  Organs 

The  district  courts,  labor  courts,  and  military  courts  lay  at  the 
bottom  of  the  judicial  hierarchy.  District  courts  were  the  courts 
of  first  instance  in  all  disputes.  Labor  courts  operated  in  Budapest 
and  the  counties,  hearing  cases  on  appeal  from  labor  affairs  arbi- 
tration committees  and  other  extrajudicial  entities  dealing  with  labor 
matters.  Military  courts  operated  in  garrisons  and  some  military 
units,  concerning  themselves  with  military  cases  and  other  cases 
that  affected  national  defense  (see  Military  Justice,  ch.  5).  The 
Supreme  Court  heard  appeals  directly  from  the  military  courts. 

County  courts  served  as  courts  of  first  appeal  for  decisions  of 
the  district  courts  and  the  labor  courts.  The  county  courts  also  acted 
as  courts  of  first  instance  in  certain  cases  involving  murder,  will- 
ful homicide,  and  grave  crimes  against  social  property.  These  courts 
functioned  as  courts  of  first  instance  in  civil  suits  of  a  certain  mag- 
nitude directed  against  the  state,  government  officials,  or  socialist 
enterprises. 

The  Supreme  Court  acted  as  the  court  of  appeal  for  the  county 
courts  and  the  military  courts.  One  of  the  judges  of  the  Supreme 
Court  or  one  of  the  court's  judges  working  together  with  lay  as- 
sessors (non-professional  judges)  could  act  as  court  of  first  instance 


187 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


for  certain  important  cases.  These  decisions  could  then  be  appealed 
to  a  council  of  the  Supreme  Court.  Councils  of  the  Supreme  Court 
specialized  in  military,  civil,  criminal,  labor  affairs,  or  economic 
cases.  The  Presidential  Council  of  the  Supreme  Court  heard  ap- 
peals from  these  councils  on  points  of  law. 

Professional  judges  and  lay  assessors  presided  over  the  courts. 
When  courts  on  any  level  acted  as  courts  of  first  instance,  they  con- 
sisted of  a  professional  judge  and  two  lay  assessors,  although  the 
law  provided  for  some  exceptions.  Courts  hearing  appeals  consisted 
of  three  professional  judges,  with  the  exception  of  the  Presidential 
Council  of  the  Supreme  Court,  which  was  led  by  the  council's 
president. 

The  Supreme  Court  could  issue  "guiding  principles  or  decisions 
in  principle"  when  guidance  was  necessary  "in  the  interests  of 
guaranteeing  uniformity  or  on  questions  of  legal  interpretation." 
These  decisions  were  binding  on  the  lower  courts.  Other  decisions 
of  the  Supreme  Court  were  not  binding,  but  they  influenced  the 
decisions  of  the  lower  courts. 

The  prosecutor  general  supervised  observance  of  the  law.  This 
official,  who  was  appointed  by  the  National  Assembly  upon  recom- 
mendation of  the  party's  Central  Committee,  headed  a  hierarchy 
of  prosecutorial  offices  organized  on  the  county  and  district  levels. 
The  prosecutor  general  undertook  criminal  investigations  and  prose- 
cutions and  reviewed  the  legality  of  actions  taken  by  governmen- 
tal, social,  and  economic  organs.  Only  the  National  Assembly, 
Presidential  Council,  and  Council  of  Ministers  were  excluded  from 
the  authority  of  the  prosecutor  general. 

Hungarian  Socialist  Workers'  Party 

The  Hungarian  Socialist  Workers'  Party  (HSWP)  formed  the 
"revolutionary  vanguard  of  the  working  class"  that  "organizes  and 
guides  the  people  in  their  struggle  to  construct  a  Socialist  society." 
The  ideology,  method  of  decision  making,  and  structure  of  the 
HSWP  all  derived  from  the  Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union 
(CPSU).  The  method  of  decision  making — democratic  cen- 
tralism— stifled  intraparty  dissent  and  secured  the  control  of  cen- 
tral party  organs  over  the  personnel  appointments  and  the  activities 
of  lower  party  organs. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  HSWP  was  a  top-down,  centralized  or- 
ganization. In  theory,  representative  party  bodies  such  as  the  party 
congress  held  supreme  decision-making  authority.  In  practice,  bod- 
ies such  as  the  party  congress  and  the  Central  Committee  on  the 
national  level  and  the  conference  on  the  county  and  district  levels 
were  too  large  and  met  too  infrequentiy  to  exercise  decision-making 


188

power  (see  fig.  9).  The  Politburo  and  Secretariat  centralized  power 
on  the  national  level,  and  the  party  bureaus  did  so  on  the  county 
and  district  rungs  of  the  hierarchy.  The  Basic  Organization,  the 
lowest  level  on  the  hierarchy,  supervised  the  activities  of  rank-and- 
file  members  in  factories,  collective  farms,  and  the  armed  forces. 

The  party,  aiming  to  be  a  monolithic  organization,  enforced  strict 
discipline  on  the  membership  for  violating  the  Party  Rules  (see  Glos- 
sary) and  for  infringing  on  the  norms  of  democratic  centralism. 
The  party  also  attempted  to  preserve  its  elite  status  within  society. 
Therefore,  it  was  very  selective  in  its  recruitment  policies.  Although 
originally  the  self-proclaimed  party  of  the  working  class,  in  the  late 
1980s  the  intelligentsia  predominated  in  its  ranks. 

The  PPF,  a  mass  organization  working  under  the  direction  of 
the  party,  acted  as  a  "transmission  belt"  for  party  policies.  As  of 
the  late  1980s,  it  had  not  yet  carved  out  an  independent  role  for 
itself  in  Hungarian  politics. 

Ideology 

The  HSWP,  as  a  party  created  under  the  influence  of  the  CPSU, 
generally  adhered  to  the  Soviet  concept  of  Marxism- Leninism, 
which  regarded  the  essence  of  socialism  to  be  state  ownership  of 
the  means  of  production,  controlled  by  a  dictatorship  acting  in  the 
name  of  the  working  class.  Hungarian  ideologists  echoed  their 
Soviet  mentors.  For  example,  Gyorgy  Aczel,  until  mid- 1988  a  mem- 
ber of  the  Politburo,  stated  that  "a  society  can  be  called  socialist 
when  a  new  political  system  and  mechanism  come  into  being  on 
the  basis  of  new  conditions  of  ownership." 

According  to  Hungarian  Marxist-Leninists,  the  welfare  of  the 
working  class  constituted  the  historical  goal  of  the  party.  However, 
since  1956  the  HSWP  has  sought  to  represent  the  interests  of  all 
Hungarians  and  has  devoted  greater  resources  to  promoting  the 
spiritual  and  material  progress  of  the  whole  society.  The  party  also 
has  come  to  acknowledge  that  "a  perfect,  complete  Marxism  does 
not,  cannot,  and  will  never  exist"  and  therefore  has  rejected  the 
notion  of  a  set  of  eternally  valid  ideological  premises  emanating 
from  Moscow.  Rather,  since  the  late  1950's  the  HSWP  has  sought 
to  adapt  general  Marxist-Leninist  ideas  to  Hungarian  conditions. 
In  the  late  1980s,  the  party  considered  the  country's  socialist 
development  to  be  in  transition  between  the  stage  of  intermedi- 
ate economic  development  and  the  stage  of  "developed  social- 
ism." Developed  socialism  promised  the  intensive  development 
of  the  economy,  emphasizing  qualitative  improvement  in  working 
conditions  and  the  standard  of  living,  as  well  as  liberalization  of

the  political  system  to  encourage  incipient  pluralism  and  popular 
political  participation. 

Democratic  Centralism 

According  to  the  Party  Rules,  the  "HSWP  is  built  on  the  prin- 
ciple of  democratic  centralism."  In  theory,  democratic  centralism 
calls  for  the  democratic  election  of  all  members  of  leading  organs 
by  secret  ballot,  subordination  of  lower  party  organs  to  higher  party 
organs,  and  the  obligation  of  the  leading  organs  to  report  regu- 
larly on  their  activities  to  their  party  organization. 

In  practice,  intraparty  democracy  functioned  within  narrowly 
circumscribed  limits  set  by  party  leaders,  who  were  the  only  offi- 
cials able  to  change  party  policies.  In  addition,  when  the  party  made 
a  decision,  members  possessed  only  the  information  provided  to 
them  by  the  party  hierarchy.  Based  on  that  information,  the  leader- 
ship expected  the  rank  and  file  to  endorse  its  decisions.  Delegates 
sent  to  meetings  at  the  next  highest  level  were,  in  fact,  chosen  by 
the  leaders  they  ostensibly  elected.  Moreover,  the  central  party  ap- 
paratus controlled  personnel  appointments  and  ensured  that  only 
"trustworthy"  members  were  appointed  to  positions  of  authority. 

In  the  late  1980s,  party  leaders  acknowledged  problems  with  this 
form  of  decision  making.  For  example,  a  party  document  argued 
that  "if  democracy  is  narrowed  down,  then  issues  are  solved  only 
by  the  leadership  and  a  group  of  experts."  This  document  main- 
tained that  greater  participation  of  the  rank  and  file  would  ensure 
wider  responsibility  and  decisions  of  higher  quality. 

Indeed,  in  1988  the  party  loosened  some  of  democratic  central- 
ism's  traditional  precepts.  For  example,  in  June  1988  the  Budapest 
party  committee  chose  among  two  candidates — Mihaly  Jasso  and 
Pal  Ivanyi — for  the  position  of  first  secretary  of  the  Budapest  party 
committee.  An  eight-person  nominating  committee  selected  the  can- 
didates based  on  consultations  with  party  committee  members, 
department  heads,  district  first  secretaries,  and  other  activists.  In 
the  first  two  votes,  neither  candidate  received  the  required  50  per- 
cent plus  one  of  the  valid  votes.  On  the  third  vote,  Jasso  received 
a  majority.  Later  in  1988,  the  party  loosened  other  strictures,  thus 
allowing  party  members  to  join  organizations,  movements,  and 
associations  considered  by  the  party  to  be  its  "potential  or  actual 
allies." 

In  July  1988,  more  evidence  appeared  that  the  party  was  loosen- 
ing the  norms  of  democratic  centralism.  The  Central  Committee 
approved  a  resolution  reducing  the  party's  nomenklatura  authority 
over  a  number  of  party,  government,  and  economic  positions.  In 
1973  approximately  1,700  such  positions  existed,  of  which  more 


191 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

than  800  could  be  filled  by  Central  Committee  secretaries  (see  Party 
Structure,  this  ch.).  In  1985  the  Central  Committee  reduced  the 
number  of  such  positions  to  1,241.  A  Central  Committee  resolu- 
tion of  July  13-14,  1988,  further  lowered  the  number  of  these  po- 
sitions to  435.  However,  in  1988  Istvan  Petrovszki,  the  head  of 
the  Central  Committee's  Party  and  Mass  Organizations  Depart- 
ment, reported  that  the  party  would  not  completely  halt  the  prac- 
tice of  recommending  personnel  for  key  positions.  When  these 
appointments  concerned  staff  in  such  bodies  as  the  National  As- 
sembly, the  PPF,  and  the  National  Council  of  Trade  Unions,  each 
of  which  had  the  right  to  nominate  and  elect  its  own  officials,  the 
party  would  make  recommendations.  However,  if  these  organiza- 
tions selected  their  own  nominees,  the  party  would  oppose  the  selec- 
tion, according  to  Petrovszki,  only  if  it  questioned  the  person's 
' 'political  reliability." 

Despite  some  changes  in  the  procedures  of  democratic  central- 
ism, in  the  late  1980s  participation  in  decision  making  remained 
low  in  the  HSWP.  Party  studies  continued  to  show  that  the  level 
of  activity  and  the  quality  of  party  work  among  the  rank  and  file 
were  poor.  Individuals  or,  at  most,  small  committees  selected 
nominees  for  party  offices.  Indeed,  Sandor  Lakos,  editor  in  chief 
of  Pdrtelet  (Party  Life),  wrote  in  the  late  1980s  that  the  most  im- 
portant question  facing  the  party  was  how  to  create  greater  party 
democracy. 

Party  Structure 

In  theory,  the  party  congress  formed  the  highest  authority  in 
the  HSWP,  although,  because  it  met  only  once  every  five  years, 
it  lacked  real  power.  Its  members  were  appointed  by  officials  of 
the  Central  Committee  and  the  Politburo,  two  organs  nominally 
responsible  to  the  party  congress.  The  Central  Committee,  which 
included  more  than  100  members  and  usually  met  once  every  three 
months,  also  was  too  large  to  exert  much  influence.  The  Central 
Committee  yielded  in  real  power  and  authority  to  the  Politburo 
and  the  Secretariat.  Also  nominally  subordinate  to  the  party  con- 
gress was  the  Central  Control  Committee,  which  enforced  party 
discipline. 

The  Politburo  and  the  Secretariat  paralleled  a  set  of  governmental 
institutions  that  included  the  Council  of  Ministers  and  the  Presiden- 
tial Council  (see  Presidential  Council,  this  ch.).  The  difference  be- 
tween party  and  government  institutions  lay  in  the  distinction 
between  policy  formation  and  policy  execution.  In  general,  the  party 
formulated  policy  and  the  government  carried  it  out.  Since  the  early 
postwar  period,  however,  the  party  has  been  heavily  involved  in 


192 


Government  and  Politics 


executing  economic,  domestic  political,  and  foreign  policies. 
Nevertheless,  in  the  late  1980s  party  leaders,  especially  General 
Secretary  Grosz,  called  upon  party  organs  to  withdraw  from  day- 
to-day  supervision  of  policy  execution  and  content  themselves  with 
establishing  broad  policy  guidelines. 

Within  the  party,  the  Politburo  was  responsible  for  selecting  pol- 
icy alternatives.  The  Secretariat  produced  policy  alternatives  for 
the  Politburo,  and,  once  that  body  made  a  decision,  the  Secretariat 
carried  them  out.  Of  course,  in  fulfilling  its  role  the  Secretariat 
often  made  policy  decisions  itself. 

The  structure  of  intermediate  party  organizations  on  the  county 
and  district  levels  resembled  that  of  the  central  institutions.  Ac- 
cording to  the  Party  Rules,  the  authoritative  body  at  each  level 
was  the  conference,  which  elected  a  committee  that  in  turn  chose 
a  bureau  with  several  members  (including  a  first  secretary)  and 
a  secretariat.  Conferences  at  the  district  level  elected  delegates  to 
the  county  party  conference.  However,  in  the  late  1980s  the  norms 
of  democratic  centralism  dictated  that  party  leaders  at  each  level 
approve  the  composition  of  the  conference  that  elected  them,  as 
well  as  the  composition  of  party  committees,  bureaus,  and  secre- 
tariats on  the  next  lowest  level. 

Basic  Organizations  made  up  the  lowest  rung  of  the  party  hier- 
archy. In  contrast  to  higher  rungs  on  the  hierarchy,  which  were 
organized  on  a  territorial  basis,  the  Basic  Organizations  were  lo- 
cated at  places  of  work,  residences,  and  armed  forces  units  having 
more  than  three  party  members.  The  party  meeting  formed  the 
highest  authority  at  this  level.  The  only  full-time,  salaried  party 
official  in  the  Basic  Organization  was  the  secretary. 

Central  Institutions 

Central  party  institutions  made  decisions  binding  on  the  party 
as  a  whole.  In  addition,  they  made  policy  for  every  aspect  of  the 
country's  domestic  and  foreign  policies.  Hungary's  central  party 
institutions,  like  those  of  other  Marxist- Leninist  parties  of  Eastern 
Europe,  were  modeled  on  those  of  the  CPSU. 

Party  Congress 

According  to  the  Party  Rules,  the  congress  was  the  *  'highest 
organ  of  the  HSWP."  The  congress  had  the  following  powers:  it 
debated  reports  of  the  Central  Committee  and  the  Central  Con- 
trol Committee,  approved  the  Party  Rules,  elected  the  Central  Con- 
trol Committee  and  the  Central  Committee,  determined  the  general 
guidelines  of  party  policy,  and  determined  the  most  immediate  and 


193 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

important  tasks  of  socialist  construction.  The  Central  Committee 
convened  a  party  congress  once  every  five  years. 

In  fact,  the  party  congress  usually  legitimated  policies  decided 
upon  elsewhere.  The  Politburo  gave  its  prior  approval  to  officials 
elected  by  the  party  congress.  The  congress  merely  ratified  solu- 
tions to  political,  social,  and  economic  problems  that  had  been  de- 
veloped by  the  Secretariat  and  approved  by  the  Politburo.  Thus, 
party  congresses  had  mainly  a  propagandistic  character. 

The  agendas  of  all  party  congresses  in  the  postwar  period  have 
been  similar.  The  general  secretary  reads  the  report  of  the  Cen- 
tral Committee.  Debates  and  approval  of  the  report  follow.  Speeches 
are  read  by  leaders  of  foreign  communist  party  delegations,  with 
the  representative  of  the  CPSU  going  first.  The  congress  also  adopts 
reports  of  other  party  organs  as  well  as  a  party  program.  Finally, 
the  congress  "elects"  the  Central  Committee,  the  Secretariat,  and 
the  Central  Control  Committee. 

The  Thirteenth  Party  Congress,  held  March  25-29,  1985,  made 
no  important  changes  in  HSWP  policies,  continuing  the  general 
policy  line  of  the  1960s  and  1970s.  In  contrast  to  earlier  party  con- 
gresses, however,  greater  degrees  of  candor  and  open  criticism 
characterized  the  Thirteenth  Party  Congress.  Social  problems  dis- 
cussed included  the  declining  birth  rate,  the  poor  quality  of  health 
services,  and  the  inequalities  created  by  economic  reform. 

The  Thirteenth  Party  Congress  had  935  delegates,  or  about  1 
for  every  1,000  party  members.  The  social  composition  of  the 
delegates  mirrored  the  social  composition  of  the  party  as  a  whole 
(see  Social  Composition  of  the  Party,  this  ch.).  Workers  and 
peasants  made  up  approximately  30  percent  of  the  delegates.  Func- 
tionaries in  party  and  social  organizations  made  up  23.1  percent 
of  the  delegates,  leading  executives  and  administrators  24.9  per- 
cent, and  employees  8.4  percent.  Women  comprised  about  27  per- 
cent of  the  delegates. 

The  Central  Committee  also  had  the  power  to  convene  a  party 
conference  at  any  time  during  the  interval  between  congresses.  The 
party  held  its  first  conference  in  May  1945  and  its  second  in  June 
1957.  In  May  1988,  the  HSWP  leadership  convened  the  Third 
Party  Conference. 

The  Third  Party  Conference  had  1  delegate  for  every  1 ,000  party 
members,  or  a  total  of  859  delegates.  In  addition,  the  106  Central 
Committee  members  and  25  members  of  the  Central  Control  Com- 
mittee also  had  the  right  to  vote.  The  conference  had  powers  simi- 
lar to  a  party  congress.  It  approved  new  directions  in  economic 
and  social  policy,  and  it  ratified  important  personnel  changes  in 
the  leadership.  Grosz  succeeded  Kadar  as  general  secretary,  and 


194 


Government  and  Politics 


the  conference  created  for  Kadar  the  new,  largely  honorific  posi- 
tion of  chairman  of  the  party.  In  addition,  liberal  reformers  Rezso 
Nyers  and  Imre  Pozsgay  became  Politburo  members. 

Central  Committee 

Between  party  congresses,  in  principle  the  supreme  power  in  the 
HSWP  rested  with  the  Central  Committee.  The  Central  Committee 
acted  on  "behalf  of  the  party  with  respect  to  state,  government, 
and  social  organs  and  in  international  relations."  The  Central  Com- 
mittee, according  to  the  Party  Rules,  held  plenums  at  least  once 
every  three  months.  It  had  the  power  to  elect  department  heads 
of  the  Central  Committee  apparatus;  direct  the  operations  of  the 
party's  central  institutions,  newspapers,  and  periodicals;  nominate 
the  editorial  boards  of  the  central  publications;  supervise  the  per- 
formance of  professional  party  activists;  allocate  party  funds;  con- 
trol the  work  of  government  organs;  and  approve  the  economic 
plan,  other  economic  and  social  policies,  and  the  national  budget 
for  debate  and  ratification  by  the  National  Assembly  (see  National 
Assembly,  this  ch.).  The  Central  Committee  also  administered  lead- 
ing party  education  institutions,  such  as  the  Political  College  and 
the  Social  Science  Institute,  and  dealt  with  ideological  questions 
and  international  affairs.  Virtually  the  whole  life  of  the  country 
fell  within  the  purview  of  the  Central  Committee. 

The  Thirteenth  Party  Congress  elected  a  105-member  Central 
Committee.  That  congress  retained  seventy-six  members  elected 
at  the  Twelfth  Party  Congress  in  1980  and  elected  twenty-nine  new 
members.  In  June  1987,  the  Central  Committee  grew  to  107  mem- 
bers after  the  deaths  of  5  members  and  the  appointments  of  7  others. 
In  April  1988,  the  Central  Committee  had  106  members  after  the 
death  of  another  member. 

Personal  merit  and  institutional  affiliation  determined  who  was 
selected  to  the  Central  Committee,  with  most  members  selected 
because  of  their  positions.  Members  included  officials  of  the  central 
party  apparatus,  party  leaders  on  the  county  level,  and  leading  offi- 
cials of  the  trade  unions,  the  military,  and  mass  organizations.  Some 
economic  officials  also  gained  membership.  Other  members  of  the 
Central  Committee  worked  in  the  media  or  were  active  in  the  fields 
of  science,  culture,  or  the  arts. 

Central  Control  Committee 

According  to  the  Party  Rules,  the  Central  Control  Committee 
"works  to  assist  the  strengthening  of  the  party's  ideological,  polit- 
ical, [and]  organizational  unity,  and  the  instruction  of  party  mem- 
bership; keeps  watch  over  the  political  behavior,  party  loyalty,  and 


195

moral  purity  of  the  party  membership;  [and]  fights  consistently 
against  all  forms  of  antiparty  factional  activity."  This  committee 
conducts  disciplinary  investigations,  hears  appeals  against  decisions 
of  lower  party  organs,  and  audits  the  economic  and  financial  records 
of  party  bodies.  In  1985  the  Thirteenth  Party  Congress  elected 
twenty-five  members  to  this  committee.  A  chairman  and  a  secre- 
tary managed  the  work  of  this  party  organ. 

Politburo 

The  Central  Committee  nominally  elected  the  membership  of 
the  Politburo,  which  directed  party  activity  between  plenums  of 
the  Central  Committee.  The  Politburo  consisted  of  the  country's 
most  powerful  political  leaders;  its  members  occupied  the  most  im- 
portant positions  in  the  party,  government,  and  mass  organiza- 
tions. In  early  1989,  Politburo  membership  included  Grosz,  the 
general  secretary;  Janos  Berecz,  the  party's  leading  ideologist; 
Istvan  Szabo,  an  agricultural  specialist;  Csaba  Hamori,  the  chair- 
man of  the  Central  Committee's  Youth  Committee;  Janos  Lukacs, 
Central  Committee  secretary  for  party  organization;  Pal  Ivanyi, 
Central  Committee  secretary  for  economic  policy;  Miklos  Nemeth, 
the  chairman  of  the  Council  of  Ministers;  and  other  government 
and  economic  administrators.  Each  Politburo  member  had  respon- 
sibility that  often  overlapped  with  an  area  managed  by  a  govern- 
ment ministry. 

The  Politburo  usually  met  once  a  week  to  address  the  country's 
foreign,  military,  economic,  and  domestic  policies.  The  Politburo 
conducted  its  meetings  in  secret,  although  it  often  invited  other 
members  of  the  party,  government,  and  mass  organizations  to  at- 
tend. The  general  secretary  chaired  the  meeting,  and  decisions  ap- 
peared to  be  reached  by  consensus.  The  Politburo  informed  Central 
Committee  plenums  about  the  issues  discussed  at  these  weekly 
meetings. 

Traditionally,  succession  to  the  position  of  general  secretary  has 
presented  problems  for  the  political  elite.  No  institutionalized  proce- 
dures governed  the  transfer  of  power  from  one  general  secretary 
to  the  next.  And  in  the  late  1980s,  the  general  secretary  did  not 
have  a  set  term  of  office.  The  general  secretary  had  to  secure  power 
by  promoting  trusted  clients  to  positions  of  power  and  influence 
within  other  leading  party,  government,  and  state  institutions.  Like 
other  Soviet  satellite  parties  in  Eastern  Europe,  the  HSWP  Polit- 
buro usually  gained  prior  Soviet  approval  for  the  appointment  of 
its  general  secretary.  The  general  secretary  also  required  con- 
tinued Soviet  support  to  remain  in  office.  Thereafter,  the  general 
secretary  had  to  establish  his  authority  by  generating  successful 


196 


Government  and  Politics 


economic,  social,  and  foreign  policies.  Kadar  accomplished  all  these 
objectives,  and  he  remained  in  the  post  of  general  secretary  from 
1956  to  1988.  However,  when  the  leadership  deemed  Kadar  too 
conservative  to  push  forward  further  economic  and  political  reforms, 
it  ousted  him  in  favor  of  Grosz,  having  gained  Soviet  approval  to 
do  so. 

Secretariat 

The  Secretariat  served  as  the  staff  of  the  Politburo,  administer- 
ing a  bureaucracy  that  oversaw  all  aspects  of  the  party's  and  the 
country's  activities.  The  Secretariat,  which  consisted  of  five  secre- 
taries, prepared  decisions  for  Politburo  approval  and  either  im- 
plemented these  decisions  itself  or  ensured  that  the  responsible 
government  bodies  carried  them  out.  In  early  1989,  four  secre- 
taries— Grosz,  Berecz,  Lukacs,  and  Ivanyi — also  sat  on  the  Polit- 
buro and  were  the  most  powerful  of  the  five  members  of  the 
Secretariat. 

The  general  secretary  supervised  the  work  of  the  Secretariat  as 
a  whole.  In  1989  the  five  secretaries  maintained  responsibility  for 
ideology,  defense  and  internal  security,  party  organization,  for- 
eign policy,  and  economic  policy.  Each  secretary  worked  with  a 
small  staff  of  three  to  five  assistants.  The  four  powerful  secretaries — 
Grosz,  Berecz,  Lukacs,  and  Ivanyi — also  chaired  committees  of 
the  Central  Committee  for  international,  legal,  and  state  manage- 
ment policy;  social  policy;  party  policy;  and  economic  and  social 
welfare  policy,  respectively.  In  1989  working  groups  of  the  Cen- 
tral Committee  formulated  long-term  policy  recommendations  in 
the  areas  of  party  building,  economics,  educational  and  cultural 
policy,  science  policy,  and  cooperatives  policy. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  heads  of  the  five  Central  Committee  depart- 
ments for  social  policy,  party  policy,  economic  and  social  welfare 
policy,  international  party  relations,  and  management  and  the  head 
of  the  Central  Committee  Office  (also  considered  a  Central  Com- 
mittee department)  answered  to  the  secretaries.  Departments  con- 
trolled the  work  of  their  counterparts  on  the  county  and  district 
levels  of  the  party.  In  addition,  they  maintained  working  relations 
with  their  counterparts  in  the  CPSU  and  the  relevant  departments 
in  the  allied  communist  parties  of  Eastern  Europe.  The  depart- 
ments worked  closely  with  their  corresponding  ministries  to  en- 
sure that  the  government  properly  implemented  party  policies.  In 
the  late  1980s,  this  task  changed,  however,  as  the  party  leadership 
sought  to  lessen  the  involvement  of  the  party  apparatus  in  the  day- 
to-day  administration  of  the  economy.  As  a  result,  in  late  1988  the 


197 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

Politburo  targeted  the  249-member  staff  of  the  Central  Commit- 
tee for  reductions  of  8  to  10  percent. 

Intermediate  Institutions 

Intermediate  party  institutions  embraced  organs  on  the  county 
and  district  levels.  The  structure  of  the  party  on  these  levels  resem- 
bled that  on  the  national  level.  In  principle,  at  each  level  the  most 
authoritative  body  was  the  conference,  which  was  attended  by 
delegates  from  lower  levels.  These  conferences  took  place  every  two 
years  to  review  reports,  discuss  the  activities  of  the  government 
and  party  bodies  under  their  jurisdiction,  and  elect  a  party  com- 
mittee. The  conference  also  elected  delegates  to  the  conference  at 
the  next  highest  level.  District  conferences  thus  selected  delegates 
to  the  county  party  conference,  and  the  county  party  conference 
elected  delegates  to  the  party  congress.  If  a  Basic  Organization  had 
more  than  1 ,500  members,  it  elected  delegates  direcdy  to  the  county 
party  conference.  In  fact,  the  party  leadership  at  each  level  nomi- 
nated the  delegates,  and  the  party  conferences  merely  confirmed 
these  nominations. 

Between  meetings  of  the  conferences,  the  party  committee  con- 
stituted the  highest  authority  on  the  district  and  county  levels.  The 
committees  on  the  county  level  met  every  three  months,  and  those 
on  the  district  level  met  every  two  months.  These  committees  chose 
a  bureau  and  a  secretariat  to  manage  the  affairs  of  their  jurisdic- 
tions between  committee  meetings.  Party  bureaus  consisted  of  the 
first  secretary,  the  head  of  the  county  or  district  government,  and 
specialists  in  industry,  economics,  agriculture,  and  youth  and  ideol- 
ogy. The  first  secretary  at  each  level  was  the  most  powerful  offi- 
cial in  the  jurisdiction. 

The  secretariat  of  the  county  and  district  party  bureaus  coordi- 
nated and  supervised  the  implementation  of  party  policies  in  the 
party  bureaucracy  and  the  government  (see  fig.  10).  The  secretar- 
ies and  the  bureaus  answered  to  their  respective  conferences  and 
committees,  but  they  also  received  directions  from  the  organs  above 
them,  particularly  the  Secretariat  of  the  Central  Committee. 
However,  the  primary  duty  of  the  district-level  apparatus  was  to 
supervise  the  Basic  Organizations.  This  apparatus  also  approved 
the  admission  and  expulsion  of  members  by  the  Basic  Organi- 
zations. 

Basic  Organizations 

A  Basic  Organization  existed  in  every  government  institution, 
production  unit,  residential  unit,  and  armed  forces  unit  having  three 
or  more  party  members.  In  1985  the  party  had  25,402  Basic 


198 


Government  and  Politics 


Organizations,  of  which  37.2  percent  were  in  government  institu- 
tions or  the  armed  forces,  30.2  percent  in  industrial  enterprises, 
15  percent  in  agricultural  enterprises,  and  the  remainder  in  resi- 
dences scattered  throughout  the  country. 

The  membership  meeting  had  the  highest  authority  in  the  Basic 
Organization.  According  to  the  Party  Rules,  membership  meet- 
ings had  to  be  held  at  least  once  every  two  months.  The  member- 
ship meeting  elected  a  secretary,  a  deputy  secretary,  and  a  small 
bureau  to  administer  the  affairs  of  the  Basic  Organization.  In  Basic 
Organizations  of  fewer  than  ten  members,  the  membership  meet- 
ing elected  only  a  secretary  and  a  deputy  secretary.  Often  the  dis- 
trict organization  nominated  the  secretaries  as  part  of  its  nomenklatura 
authority.  In  the  1980s,  however,  competitive  elections  became 
more  frequent.  In  1985  one-third  of  the  newly  elected  secretaries 
were  newcomers  to  the  position,  and,  compared  with  1980,  the 
number  of  multiple  candidacies  rose.  Large  Basic  Organizations 
were  divided  into  party  groups,  which  elected  a  steward  to  direct 
their  affairs.  The  party  groups  assessed  the  work  and  behavior  of 
their  members  and  the  fulfillment  of  party  tasks. 

The  Basic  Organization  performed  several  tasks.  Most  impor- 
tant, the  Basic  Organization  implemented  party  decisions  in  the 
economic  enterprise  or  other  unit  under  its  jurisdiction.  The  Basic 
Organization  conducted  agitation  and  propaganda  to  explain  party 
policies  to  nonparty  members,  to  inspire  nonparty  members  to  meet 
regime  goals,  and  to  encourage  enthusiasm  in  the  workplace.  The 
Basic  Organization  admitted  new  members  subject  to  the  approval 
of  the  district  party  organization.  The  Basic  Organization  gave  in- 
formal courses  for  party  and  nonparty  members  on  ideology,  party 
history,  and  current  events.  The  Basic  Organization  controlled  the 
activity  of  enterprise  management  to  ensure  the  fulfillment  of  its 
economic  plan.  Finally,  the  party  expected  the  Basic  Organizations 
to  be  vigilant  and  to  report  activities  within  their  jurisdiction  that 
could  be  considered  harmful  or  disloyal. 

Discipline 

The  Party  Rules  stated  that  members  who  violated  party  norms 
were  subject  to  punishments  ranging  from  a  reprimand  to  expul- 
sion. In  addition,  a  less  formal  form  of  punishment  involved  the 
so-called  "exchange  of  party  cards,"  in  which  the  old  party  cards 
were  replaced  for  the  faithful  and  the  membership  of  those  per- 
sons who  had  broken  party  discipline  was  revoked. 

The  HSWP  could  take  several  forms  of  disciplinary  action  against 
its  members.  Punishments  included  a  reprimand,  censure,  severe 
censure,  severe  censure  with  final  warning,  and  expulsion.  From

Figure  10.  Structure  of  the  County  Committee  Apparatus,  1986 

1980  through  1985,  the  HSWP  expelled  7,639  members.  In  addi- 
tion, the  party  could  suspend  members  from  their  office  for  a  spec- 
ified period  of  time  or  could  recall  party  members  from  public 
office. 

Disciplinary  proceedings  took  place  at  the  membership  meet- 
ings of  the  Basic  Organization.  Higher  party  organs  confirmed  or 
rejected  the  decision  of  the  Basic  Organization.  Ultimately,  the 
party's  Central  Control  Committee  could  also  review  the  deci- 
sion. 

The  exchange  of  party  cards  took  place  on  a  party- wide  scale. 
Between  1945  and  1977,  six  such  exchanges  occurred.  The  HSWP 
began  another  exchange  of  party  cards  in  1986  to  strengthen  party 
discipline  and  maintain  Kadar's  control  over  the  party.  As  of  April 
1988,  approximately  46,000  members  left  the  party  as  a  result  of 
that  exchange:  250  were  expelled,  about  40,000  left  voluntarily, 
1,500  were  advised  to  leave,  and  4,000  were  taken  off  the  mem- 
bership list,  probably  for  failure  to  pay  their  membership  dues. 

Membership 

The  HSWP  placed  strict  requirements  on  membership  in  the 
party.  Members  had  to  work  actively  on  the  party's  behalf  and 
set  a  moral  and  political  example  for  nonparty  members. 


200 


Government  and  Politics 


The  HSWP  opened  membership  to  persons  at  least  eighteen  years 
of  age  who  accepted  Marxist-Leninist  ideals,  participated  in  one 
or  more  of  the  party's  Basic  Organizations,  and  paid  their  dues. 
In  addition,  the  Party  Rules  obliged  members  to  accept  the  poli- 
cies, guidelines,  and  organizational  rules  of  the  HSWP.  The  Party 
Rules  called  upon  members  to  be  politically  active  and  morally 
above  reproach,  command  the  respect  of  others  for  their  work,  and 
4 'live  in  a  socialist  fashion."  The  party  enjoined  its  members  to 
master  the  fundamentals  of  Marxism-Leninism,  expand  their  prac- 
tical and  theoretical  knowledge  of  this  ideology,  and  fight  against 
the  remnants  of  bourgeois  ideology  and  morality.  Members  had 
to  observe  the  rules  of  party  discipline  and  execute  the  decisions 
of  the  party  and  the  government.  Members  also  undertook  self- 
criticism  to  expose  their  own  shortcomings.  Finally,  they  worked 
to  strengthen  and  expand  the  party's  links  with  the  masses  and  to 
propagate  the  party's  ideals  and  policies. 

Party  members  enjoyed  certain  rights.  They  participated  in  the 
discussion  of  theoretical,  political,  and  organizational  issues  at  party 
meetings  and  voted  on  the  adoption  of  resolutions.  Members  had 
the  right  to  vote  in  party  elections  and  to  stand  as  candidates.  Mem- 
bers were  able  to  criticize  "in  a  party-like  manner"  the  work  of 
another  party  member  or  party  organ  at  meetings,  to  present  a 
request  or  recommendation  to  the  Basic  Organization,  as  well  as 
to  higher  party  bodies  including  the  party  congress,  and  to  receive 
a  valid  response.  However,  democratic  centralism  discouraged  such 
criticism.  Any  party  member  who  questioned  the  policies  of  the 
leadership  would  be  subject  to  party  discipline. 

Social  Composition  of  the  Party 

In  mid-1988  the  HSWP  had  about  817,000  members,  or  10.3 
percent  of  Hungary's  adult  population.  Nominally  the  party  of  the 
working  class,  the  HSWP  actually  was  dominated  by  members  of 
the  intelligentsia.  Men  outnumbered  women. 

Since  1956  the  proportion  of  workers  and  peasants  in  the  party 
has  declined.  In  1962  industrial  and  agricultural  workers  made  up 
59  percent  of  the  party.  This  figure  dropped  to  38  percent  in  1970, 
and  by  1985  it  had  declined  to  31.9  percent.  By  contrast,  in  1975 
members  of  the  intelligentsia  made  up  40  percent  of  the  member- 
ship, and  by  1985  that  figure  had  risen  to  42.4  percent. 

Other  statistics  showed  that  members  used  their  membership  to 
raise  their  social  status.  In  1985  about  62  percent  of  party  mem- 
bers originally  were  workers  when  they  joined  the  party  and  8.9 
percent  originally  were  peasants.  As  a  result  of  the  influence  that 
party  members  held  in  society  and  the  favors  that  the  regime  granted 


201 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

to  party  members,  about  40  percent  of  the  party  membership  was 
able  to  climb  into  the  ranks  of  the  intelligentsia  from  the  working 
class  and  the  peasantry.  Thus,  children  of  workers  and  peasants 
used  the  party  as  a  vehicle  of  upward  mobility.  Having  joined  the 
"political  class,"  party  members,  particularly  full-time  party  offi- 
cials, could  pass  their  new  status  on  to  their  children. 

Statistics  on  the  educational  background  of  party  members  con- 
firmed the  dominance  of  the  intelligentsia.  In  1985  approximately 
21  percent  of  party  members  had  received  degrees  from  a  higher 
educational  institution.  The  corresponding  figure  for  the  popula- 
tion as  a  whole  was  only  6.1  percent.  In  1985  about  43.9  percent 
of  the  membership  had  a  high  school  or  special  secondary  school 
education.  The  figure  for  society  as  a  whole  was  27.1  percent.  Be- 
tween 1975  and  1985,  the  proportion  of  members  who  had  no  more 
than  a  primary- school  education  declined  from  55.4  to  28.4  percent. 

Historically  women  have  formed  a  minority  of  the  party's  mem- 
bership, although  since  the  1960s  their  percentage  of  the  member- 
ship has  risen.  In  1966  women  made  up  22.9  percent  of  the  HSWP, 
and  by  1970  this  figure  had  risen  to  24.4  percent.  By  mid-1988 
women  made  up  approximately  32.1  percent  of  the  party.  In  the 
late  1980s,  however,  women  generally  had  not  advanced  into  posi- 
tions of  power.  For  example,  in  the  Central  Committee  elected  in 
1985,  a  mere  11  percent  of  the  members  were  women.  In  early 
1989,  only  two  women  sat  on  the  Politburo. 

Patriotic  People's  Front 

According  to  the  Constitution,  the  Patriotic  People's  Front  (PPF) 
'  'unites  the  forces  of  society  for  the  complete  building  up  of  social- 
ism, for  the  solution  of  political,  economic,  and  cultural  tasks." 
The  Constitution  adds  that  the  PPF  "cooperates  in  the  election 
and  operation  of  the  organs  of  popular  representation."  The  PPF 
facilitated  broad  mass  participation  in  regime  policies  and  gener- 
ated mass  support  for  party  programs.  In  1988,  according  to  Imre 
Pozsgay,  at  that  time  head  of  the  PPF,  the  tasks  of  that  organiza- 
tion included  helping  to  achieve  a  new  social  accord  in  Hungary, 
consolidating  new  public  thinking  in  the  public  consciousness,  and 
helping  citizens  to  participate  in  building  a  socialist  society  from 
below. 

Approximately  130,000  grass-roots  committees  elected  by  local 
citizens  carried  out  PPF  policies  on  the  local  level.  A  congress  of 
the  PPF  met  every  four  years  to  elect  its  National  Council  and  to 
review  the  activities  of  the  organization.  The  National  Council 
elected  the  National  Presidency  and  the  National  Secretariat,  which 
managed  the  PPF  and  set  policy  for  it. 


202 


Government  and  Politics 


The  PPF  undertook  a  variety  of  tasks.  Perhaps  most  important, 
it  organized  national  and  local  elections  (see  Elections  to  the  Na- 
tional Assembly;  County  and  District  Government,  this  ch.).  The 
PPF  served  as  an  umbrella  organization  that  united  such  bodies 
as  the  National  Council  of  Hungarian  Women,  the  National  Gypsy 
Council,  and  other  bodies  representing  national  minorities  in  Hun- 
gary. The  PPF  also  provided  a  framework  for  cooperation  among 
different  classes  and  strata  of  society,  between  religious  believers 
and  nonbelievers,  and  between  party  members  and  nonparty  mem- 
bers. Finally,  the  PPF  attempted  to  protect  citizens'  interests  by 
leading  the  struggle  against  the  corruption  and  abuse  of  power. 

Mass  Media 

In  Hungary  the  media  served  as  instruments  of  regime  policy, 
so  their  primary  task  was  to  promote  the  party's  policies.  Although 
other  organizations,  such  as  the  PPF,  the  Communist  Youth 
League,  and  the  trade  unions,  produced  their  own  publications, 
the  regime  controlled  their  content  (see  Mass  Organizations,  ch.  2). 
In  the  1980s,  the  regime  continued  to  suppress  other  sources  of 
information,  although  it  made  available  in  hotels  some  Western 
periodicals  and  newspapers.  The  regime  banned  private  owner- 
ship of  the  media. 

In  the  late  1980s,  Hungary  had  no  censorship  laws.  However, 
informal  censorship  occurred  in  a  number  of  different  ways.  Both 
the  party  and  the  government  had  organs  for  censorship.  The  party 
set  guidelines,  which  were  transmitted  from  its  Department  for  Agi- 
tation and  Propaganda  to  the  lower  party  organs  and  to  the  edi- 
tors in  chief  of  the  media.  The  Council  of  Ministers'  Information 
Bureau  acted  as  the  government's  agency  for  censorship  (see  Coun- 
cil of  Ministers,  this  ch.).  The  Hungarian  Telegraph  Agency 
(Magyar  Tavirati  Iroda — MTI)  was  the  primary  source  of  infor- 
mation for  the  media.  Because  the  news  media  often  lacked  other 
sources  of  information,  they  depended  on  MTI  for  materials.  MTI 
could  thus  exercise  centralized  control  over  the  kinds  of  informa- 
tion that  appeared  in  print  or  over  the  airwaves.  The  regime  care- 
fully selected  editors  and  informed  them  about  party  and 
government  censorship  standards.  Editors  could  be  fired  for  failure 
to  comply  with  these  standards.  For  example,  in  1983  Ferenc  Kulin, 
editor  of  Mozgo  Vildg  (World  In  Motion),  lost  his  position  for  "sys- 
tematic defiance"  of  party  directives.  Editors  often  exercised  in- 
formal censorship,  rejecting  an  article,  for  instance,  because  they 
claimed  it  did  not  suit  the  profile  of  their  publication.  Editors  also 
exercised  censorship  when  they  recommended  changes  to  a  work 
that  removed  or  softened  its  politically  sensitive  parts.  Paradoxically,

the  lack  of  censorship  standards  encouraged  editors  to  take  a  con- 
servative approach  to  censorship  to  ensure  that  their  publications 
did  not  include  materials  that  might  offend  anyone  in  authority. 

On  March  20,  1986,  the  National  Assembly  passed  a  new  press 
law  defining  the  "rights  and  duties  of  journalists  and  the  right  of 
the  public  to  fast  and  timely  information."  The  law  compelled 
government  officials  to  respond  to  requests  for  information  from 
reporters.  Journalists,  however,  had  to  submit  a  copy  of  their  arti- 
cle to  people  they  had  interviewed  for  it.  The  law  prevented  the 
publication  of  materials  that  "would  hurt  the  constitutional  order 
of  the  People's  Republic  and  its  international  interests  .  .  .  and 
public  morals."  Critical  pieces  of  writing  could  be  rejected  on  that 
basis.  In  addition,  according  to  Politburo  member  and  Central 
Committee  secretary  Berecz,  the  law  proscribed  questioning  Hun- 
gary's "socialist  achievements"  and  its  "national  historical  and 
moral  values." 

Hungary  had  three  major  daily  newspapers:  Nepszabadsdg  (Peo- 
ple's Freedom),  the  official  organ  of  the  HSWP;  Nepszava  (Peo- 
ple's Voice),  the  organ  of  the  trade  unions;  and  Magyar  Nemzet 
(Hungarian  Nation),  the  organ  of  the  PPF  and  the  most  liberal 
of  the  three  newspapers.  Nepszabadsdg  was  the  party  daily  and  had 
a  circulation  of  approximately  467,000  in  early  1989.  In  Novem- 
ber 1988,  a  new  daily — A  Nap  (The  Sun) — began  publication  with 
a  circulation  of  between  80,000  and  100,000  a  day.  An  afternoon 
paper — Esti  Hirlap  (Evening  News) — had  a  circulation  of  between 
200,000  and  250,000  a  day. 

The  regime  also  published  a  number  of  specialized  journals. 
Tdrsadalmi  Szemle  (Social  Review)  was  the  HSWP's  ideological 
monthly;  it  had  a  circulation  of  approximately  41,000.  Pdrtelet  (Party 
Life)  had  a  circulation  of  about  130,000.  Other,  more  obscure  jour- 
nals contained  more  interesting  subject  matter  by  virtue  of  their 
lower  circulation  and  more  specialized  audiences.  Valosdg  (Reality) 
was  intellectually  the  most  stimulating  journal  because  it  dealt  with 
politically  sensitive  and  highly  unorthodox  topics. 

Most  provincial  journals  treated  only  topics  of  regional  interest. 
Nevertheless,  Jelenkor  (Present  Age),  published  in  Pecs,  and  Forrds 
(Source),  published  in  Kecskemet,  had  wider  audiences  because 
they  included  interviews  with  national  literary  figures  and  scho- 
larly research  from  Budapest.  Tiszatdj  (Tisza  Country),  published 
in  Szeged,  claimed  a  wide  readership  because  it  published  materi- 
als on  Hungarian  national  minorities  living  outside  the  country. 
However,  in  1986  the  government  banned  Tiszatdj  because  of  "pub- 
lication policy  mistakes."  The  editors  were  dismissed  and  subjected 


204 


Government  and  Politics 


to  party  discipline.  The  publication  reappeared  in  1987,  and  the 
party  rehabilitated  the  editors  in  early  1989. 

In  the  late  1980s,  television  was  the  most  popular  form  of  enter- 
tainment. Approximately  95  percent  of  Hungarian  households  had 
a  television  set.  In  the  early  and  mid-1980s,  Hungarians  watched 
an  average  of  140  minutes  of  television  programs  per  day.  Program- 
ming on  the  country's  two  channels  ran  from  mid- afternoon  to  late 
at  night.  In  addition,  some  hotels  and  local  cable  and  aerial  sys- 
tems had  the  equipment  to  receive  and  transmit  Western-relayed 
satellite  programs.  Near  the  country's  western  border,  households 
with  a  good  roof  antenna  could  receive  one  Austrian,  two  Yugo- 
slav, and  two  Czechoslovak  channels. 

Hungary's  three  radio  stations  broadcast  a  variety  of  program- 
ming. In  addition,  Hungary  concluded  a  radio  agreement  with  Aus- 
tria to  establish  a  joint  German-language  radio  station  called  Radio 
Danubius.  In  May  1986,  the  station  began  broadcasting  a  twelve- 
hour  program.  The  station  eventually  was  to  attain  economic  self- 
sufficiency  through  advertising. 

In  the  late  1980s,  videocassette  recorders  (VCRs)  became  very 
popular  in  Hungary.  At  the  end  of  1987,  VCRs  numbered  between 
200,000  and  300,000,  and  an  estimated  1  million  people  had  ac- 
cess to  a  VCR.  In  1984  Hungary  became  the  first  East  European 
country  to  have  stores  renting  videotapes,  and  more  than  fifty  video- 
tape outlets  existed  in  late  1987.  The  government-operated  out- 
lets, however,  had  only  800  titles  and  a  total  of  only  15,000  copies. 
Illegally  produced,  copied,  and  distributed  cassettes  accounted  for 
80  percent  of  the  videotape  market.  These  tapes  treated  taboo 
themes  such  as  religion,  anti- Soviet  sentiments,  sex,  and  violence. 
The  regime  acknowledged  that  these  tapes  had  spread  throughout 
the  country  like  a  "contagious  disease"  and  held  them  responsi- 
ble for  the  rise  in  the  crime  rate,  increased  drug  use,  and  the  higher 
suicide  rate  (see  Health,  ch.  2). 

Foreign  Policy 

In  the  1980s,  Hungary  attempted  to  carve  out  a  semi-independent 
role  for  itself  within  the  Soviet  alliance  system  in  Eastern  Europe. 
The  origins  of  the  Hungarian  position  lay  in  the  regime's  efforts 
to  promote  economic  reform,  which  required  Western  involvement 
and  support.  The  regime  also  sought  to  create  popular  support  for 
itself  by  providing  an  abundance  of  consumer  goods  supplied  by 
the  West.  For  reasons  of  history  and  tradition,  Hungary  cultivated 
ties  with  Austria  and  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West  Ger- 
many). In  the  mid-  and  late  1980s,  Hungary  also  attempted  to  fur- 
ther relations  with  Britain  and  the  United  States.  In  addition,  as 


205 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

further  evidence  of  its  initiative  in  foreign  policy,  Hungary  devel- 
oped relations  with  Israel,  China,  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  (South 
Korea),  which  had  previously  been  considered  "pariah"  states  by 
most  East  European  regimes. 

Hungary's  most  important  ally  was  the  Soviet  Union,  with  which 
it  has  enjoyed  particularly  good  relations  since  1986,  when  Soviet 
leader  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev  initiated  his  reform  program.  In  the 
late  1980s,  Hungary  strongly  supported  Soviet  foreign  policy  posi- 
tions. In  return,  Hungary  received  Soviet  support  for  its  efforts 
at  domestic  reform.  Hungary  also  accepted  integration  into  the  al- 
liance system  through  the  Council  for  Mutual  Economic  Assistance 
(Comecon — see  Glossary)  and  the  Warsaw  Pact  (see  Glossary). 

Relations  with  its  other  communist  neighbors  played  a  crucial 
role  in  Hungarian  foreign  policy.  The  state  of  relations  between 
Hungary  and  Romania,  Czechoslovakia,  and  Yugoslavia  gener- 
ally depended  on  how  these  countries  treated  their  Hungarian 
minorities.  Because  Yugoslavia  treated  its  Hungarian  minority  well, 
relations  between  the  two  countries  were  excellent.  In  Czecho- 
slovakia, the  relation  between  Slovaks  and  ethnic  Hungarians  were 
not  smooth.  Through  bilateral  contacts,  Hungary  sought  to  en- 
courage the  Czechoslovak  government  to  improve  its  treatment  of 
Czechoslovakia's  Hungarian  minority.  However,  Romania's  treat- 
ment of  the  Hungarian  minority  in  Transylvania  received  world- 
wide condemnation.  Hungary  sought,  through  a  variety  of  bilateral 
and  multilateral  efforts,  to  encourage  more  equitable  treatment  of 
Hungarians  in  Romania. 

Principles  of  Foreign  Policy 

When  superpower  relations  deteriorated  in  the  early  to  mid- 
1980s,  Hungary  defined  a  role  for  small-  and  medium-sized  states 
in  maintaining  ties  between  countries  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  and  the 
North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO).  The  reasons  for 
Hungary's  interest  in  East- West  dialogue  lay  in  its  relatively  liberal 
domestic  policies  as  well  as  its  foreign  economic  policies.  Follow- 
ing the  Revolution  of  1956,  the  leadership  determined  that  a  pol- 
icy of  isolation  threatened  the  stability  of  the  Soviet  alliance  system 
in  general  and  Hungary  in  particular.  In  addition,  the  leadership 
believed  that  without  access  to  the  world  economy,  Hungary's  econ- 
omy would  continue  to  lag  behind  the  economies  of  the  West. 

In  the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s,  the  Soviet  invasion  of  Afghan- 
istan, the  crackdown  on  the  Solidarity  labor  union  movement  in 
Poland,  and  the  deployment  of  United  States  intermediate-range 
ballistic  missiles  (IRBMs)  in  Western  Europe  led  to  a  deteriora- 
tion of  relations  between  the  superpowers.  Hungary  resisted  this 


206 


Government  and  Politics 


worsening  of  relations  with  the  West.  Thus,  the  theory  that  Hun- 
gary had  won  some  freedom  of  action  in  the  domestic  sphere  by 
remaining  loyal  to  the  Soviet  Union  in  foreign  policy  lost  much 
of  its  validity  in  the  mid-1980s. 

Several  factors  led  Hungary  to  push  for  an  independent  stance. 
First,  the  Kadar  regime  believed  that  any  return  to  economic  iso- 
lation from  the  West  would  endanger  policies  designed  to  moder- 
nize the  economy  and  to  promote  political  liberalization.  In  turn, 
these  two  policies  were  intended  to  encourage  popular  political  sup- 
port for  the  regime  and  bolster  its  legitimacy.  Their  failure  could 
have  led  to  political  catastrophe  for  the  leadership.  Second,  Romania 
and  the  German  Democratic  Republic  (East  Germany)  were  pur- 
suing their  own  independent  initiatives  with  selected  NATO  coun- 
tries. The  Hungarians  believed  that  their  policy  would  also  find 
supporters  in  Bulgaria  and  Poland,  both  of  which  needed  help  from 
the  West  to  overcome  their  economic  problems.  Third,  the  Soviet 
leadership  experienced  internal  differences  over  the  issue  of  East- 
West  relations.  In  1984  some  Soviet  economists  and  political  com- 
mentators positively  evaluated  the  Hungarian  reforms.  The  Kadar 
regime  believed  that  it  had  allies  in  the  top  Soviet  leadership,  pos- 
sibly including  then-General  Secretary  Konstantin  U.  Chernenko 
himself. 

The  Soviet  Union  used  its  allies  in  the  Communist  Party  of 
Czechoslovakia  (CPCz)  to  reply  to  Hungary's  initiatives.  On 
March  30,  1984,  the  CPCz  daily  Rude  prdvo  published  a  scathing 
critique  of  Hungary's  policy,  which  it  labeled  "one-sided  par- 
ticularism." The  article  maintained  that  the  Hungarian  stance 
would  lead  to  a  weakening  of  the  common  international  strategy 
and  foreign  policy  of  the  Warsaw  Pact,  encourage  efforts  by 
capitalist  states  to  gain  one-sided  advantages  by  promoting  differ- 
ences among  socialist  states,  and  favor  a  narrow,  nationally  oriented 
approach  to  transitory  economic  difficulties.  The  Czechoslovak 
newspaper  also  argued  that  the  Hungarians  attached  importance 
to  distinctions  between  large  and  small  states  rather  than  to  the 
class  structure  of  these  states.  Finally,  Rude  prdvo  complained  that 
national  interests  were  beginning  to  take  precedence  over  the  in- 
terests of  the  Soviet  alliance  system  as  a  whole.  Articles  in  several 
Soviet  party  and  government  publications  echoed  the  Czechoslo- 
vak comments,  suggesting  that  the  CPCz  and  the  CPSU  coordi- 
nated their  attacks  on  Hungary. 

Secretary  of  the  Central  Committee  for  Foreign  Policy  Matyas 
Szurds  laid  out  Hungary's  response  to  the  charges  of  its  allies.  In 
1984  Szuros  began  publishing  his  justifications  for  Hungary's 
stance.  He  later  added  other  arguments  to  underscore  Hungary's 


207 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

stance.  Szuros  averred  that,  although  relations  between  the  super- 
powers might  be  poor,  historical  traditions  and  contemporary  geo- 
political relations  could  encourage  the  development  of  relations 
between  certain  socialist  states  and  certain  capitalist  states.  Par- 
ticularly the  small-  and  medium-sized  states  in  each  alliance  sys- 
tem, through  dialogue  and  constructive  relations,  could  improve 
the  international  atmosphere  and  thereby  create  possibilities  for 
the  improvement  of  relations  between  the  United  States  and  the 
Soviet  Union.  In  turn,  such  an  improvement  could  lead  to  an  overall 
reduction  of  international  tension. 

Szuros  believed  that  national  interests  had  to  be  given  more 
weight  when  formulating  common  Warsaw  Pact  positions  on  for- 
eign policy  and  military  issues.  A  conception  of  the  common  goals 
of  socialist  states  could  command  the  support  of  the  individual  so- 
cialist countries  only  if  it  took  national  interests  into  account.  Szuros 
rejected  the  notion  that,  by  pursuing  its  national  interests,  Hun- 
gary sought  to  gain  one-sided  advantages  from  the  West.  He  wrote 
that  as  a  result  of  historical  and  geopolitical  factors,  capitalist  states 
showed  different  degrees  of  interest  in  developing  relations  with 
the  various  socialist  states.  Thus  Bulgaria  carried  on  intense  rela- 
tions with  Greece  and  Turkey,  and  Austria  and  West  Germany 
developed  close  relations  with  Hungary. 

In  1985  and  1986,  Szuros  broadened  these  considerations  when 
he  wrote  that  the  communist  movement  lacked  an  organizational 
and  a  political  center  that  could  enforce  prescriptions  for  behavior. 
He  argued  that  although  a  common  ideology  united  the  interna- 
tional communist  movement,  ideology  was  neither  a  code  of  dogma 
nor  a  closed  system  but  a  body  of  ideas  undergoing  constant  change. 
Szuros  therefore  advocated  the  "proper  adaptation"  of  the  basic 
principles  of  Marxism-Leninism  to  specific  national  circumstances. 
These  formulations  justified  renovations  in  domestic  policy,  in  turn 
leading  to  innovations  in  foreign  policy,  including  Hungary's  open- 
ing to  the  West. 

In  July  1986,  Szuros  went  beyond  these  arguments  when  he  wrote 
that  small-  and  medium-sized  countries  had  more  to  lose  in  the 
event  of  a  conflict  between  the  superpowers  than  did  the  super- 
powers themselves.  Therefore,  smaller  countries  had  objective  in- 
terests in  seeking  and  maintaining  detente.  Smaller  countries  also 
had  a  special  responsibility  to  contribute  to  an  atmosphere  encourag- 
ing the  reduction  of  tension,  deepening  of  dialogue,  and  strength- 
ening of  trust.  Therefore,  claimed  Szuros,  small-  and  medium-sized 
states  had  interests  of  their  own,  regardless  of  their  class  structure. 

Relations  with  the  Soviet  Union 

In  the  postwar  period,  several  factors  contributed  to  Soviet 


208 


Government  and  Politics 


influence  in  Hungary.  The  Soviet  Union  maintained  a  large  troop 
presence  in  Eastern  Europe  (see  Soviet  Influence,  ch.  5).  The  struc- 
tural characteristics  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  minimized  the  indepen- 
dence of  East  European  military  establishments  and  the  CPSU 
exercised  significant  political  influence  within  the  HSWP  and  the 
government. 

Relations  between  Hungary  and  the  Soviet  Union  also  depended 
on  a  series  of  more  personal  factors.  Thus,  before  Gorbachev  as- 
sumed power  in  the  Soviet  Union,  the  conservative  Soviet  leader- 
ship disapproved  of  Hungarian  reform  efforts,  and  relations  between 
the  two  countries  were  therefore  cool.  After  Gorbachev  became 
general  secretary  of  the  CPSU  and  initiated  his  reform  program, 
the  leadership  of  each  country  found  in  the  other  an  ally  for  its 
program  of  economic  and  political  change.  Consequently,  begin- 
ning in  mid- 1986  relations  between  Hungary  and  the  Soviet  Union 
warmed  considerably. 

At  the  Thirteenth  Party  Congress,  the  HSWP  stressed  the  deci- 
sive importance  of  relations  with  the  Soviet  Union.  At  this  con- 
gress, however,  Grigorii  V.  Romanov,  then  a  hard-line  member 
of  the  CPSU  Politburo  and  Secretariat,  criticized  Hungary  for  its 
relations  with  the  West.  Romanov  supported  "businesslike  con- 
tacts" with  capitalist  countries,  but  he  warned  that  the  socialist 
countries  could  not  "allow  the  imperialist  forces  to  use  economic 
levers  as  a  means  of  political  pressure  and  interference  in  the  af- 
fairs of  socialist  states."  Romanov  advised  Hungary  not  to  go  too 
far  in  increasing  trade  and  cooperation  with  the  West. 

The  Twenty-Seventh  Party  Congress  of  the  CPSU  in  March  1986 
marked  the  beginning  of  a  steady  improvement  in  relations  be- 
tween Hungary  and  the  Soviet  Union.  Kadar  endorsed  the  Soviet 
reform  program  and  drew  parallels  between  the  CPSU's  party  con- 
gress and  the  HSWP's  Thirteenth  Party  Congress.  Hungary  also 
supported  the  Soviet  Union's  foreign  policy  and  disarmament 
proposals.  In  June  1986,  Gorbachev  visited  Hungary  for  talks  with 
Hungarian  party  and  government  leaders.  According  to  the  joint 
communique,  both  sides  shared  "fully  identical  views"  on  foreign 
and  security  policies.  Each  side  pledged  to  assist  the  other  in  ac- 
celerating socioeconomic  and  scientific  development. 

In  the  mid-  to  late  1980s,  the  Soviet  Union  sought  to  expand 
bilateral  economic  relations  and  scientific-technical  relations  with 
Hungary.  The  Soviet  Union  needed  Hungarian  scientific  and  tech- 
nical expertise  as  well  as  economic  assistance  to  strengthen  Soviet 
economic  reform.  Hungary,  by  contrast,  sought  to  devote  more 
resources  to  its  trade  with  the  West  and  with  the  newly  industrial- 
ized countries  of  the  Third  World. 


209 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

Soviet  efforts  to  tie  Hungary  more  closely  to  the  Soviet  econ- 
omy and  to  Comecon  have  achieved  some  success.  In  1985  Hun- 
gary and  the  Soviet  Union  signed  a  long-range  economic  and 
scientific-technical  program  of  cooperation  to  last  until  the  year 
2000.  The  Kadar-Gorbachev  talks  in  1985  called  for  the  strength- 
ening of  scientific-technical  cooperation  and  the  development  of 
new  forms  of  cooperation  between  each  country's  research  insti- 
tutes, economic  enterprises,  and  work  cooperatives.  At  a  meeting 
between  Grosz  and  Gorbachev  in  July  1987,  the  two  countries 
agreed  to  expand  bilateral  trade  in  the  1986-90  period.  The  two 
leaders  also  commissioned  a  fifteen-  to  twenty-year  plan  for  de- 
veloping economic  and  scientific-technical  cooperation  between  their 
two  countries. 

In  1988  two  high-level  meetings  took  place  between  Soviet  and 
Hungarian  leaders.  In  April,  Soviet  then-President  Andrei  A. 
Gromyko  visited  Hungary  to  promote  the  expansion  of  bilateral 
ties  in  light  of  the  changes  taking  place  in  both  countries.  Gromyko 
met  with  Kadar,  and  they  expressed  a  common  interest  in  im- 
plementing reform  in  their  own  countries  and  in  establishing  new 
kinds  of  cooperation.  Grosz  was  the  first  East  European  leader  to 
visit  the  Soviet  Union  after  the  CPSU's  Nineteenth  Party  Confer- 
ence in  July,  a  sign  of  Hungary's  close  relations  with  Moscow. 
Gorbachev  praised  the  HSWP  party  conference  and  drew  parallels 
between  the  reform  efforts  of  both  countries.  Grosz  called  his  meet- 
ing with  Gorbachev  ' 'useful  and  valuable"  and  said  that  the  two 
countries  had  never  been  more  in  harmony. 

Relations  with  Other  Communist  Neighbors 

In  the  mid-  to  late  1980s,  Hungary  attached  particular  impor- 
tance to  relations  with  Romania,  Czechoslovakia,  and  Yugoslavia, 
because  each  of  these  countries  contained  rather  large  Hungarian 
minorities.  A  common  culture  and  language,  as  well  as  family  ties, 
linked  Hungarians  in  these  countries  to  Hungary.  The  Romanian 
government  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  the  Czechoslovak  government 
have  subjected  their  Hungarian  minorities  to  various  forms  of  po- 
litical and  cultural  oppression.  On  the  one  hand,  Hungarian  pub- 
lic opinion  has  pressured  the  HSWP  leadership  and  the  government 
to  work  for  the  amelioration  of  the  harsh  circumstances  of  Hun- 
garians in  neighboring  countries.  The  regime,  seeking  to  strengthen 
its  legitimacy  within  Hungarian  society,  has  taken  up  the  cause 
of  Hungarians  living  abroad.  On  the  other  hand,  the  prospect  of 
open  discord  within  the  Soviet  alliance  system  has  restrained  Hun- 
garian criticism  of  Romanian  and  Czechoslovak  nationality  poli- 
cies.

Government  and  Politics 


Romania 

According  to  Romanian  statistics,  1.7  million  Hungarians  were 
living  in  Romanian  Transylvania  in  the  late  1980s.  Western  ex- 
perts maintained  that  at  least  2  million  Hungarians  inhabited  this 
part  of  Romania,  and  some  estimates  put  the  figure  as  high  as  2.2 
million.  Although  problems  existed  earlier,  in  the  mid-1980s 
Romanian  treatment  of  the  Hungarian  minority  became  increas- 
ingly harsh.  For  example,  the  Romanian  city  of  Bra§ov  had  no 
Hungarian-language  schools,  although  the  city  was  home  to  Tran- 
sylvania's second-largest  Hungarian  minority.  In  1983  the  Roma- 
nian government  reduced  Hungarian-language  television  broadcasts 
from  two  and  one-half  hours  per  day  to  one  hour  per  day.  In  1984 
it  discontinued  Hungarian-language  programming  altogether.  The 
Romanian  government  allowed  the  importation  of  only  one 
periodical — Sakkalet  (Chess  Life) — from  Hungary.  The  Romanian 
government  also  attempted  to  prevent  Hungarians  from  traveling 
to  Romania.  During  the  height  of  the  summer  tourist  season,  Hun- 
garians had  to  wait  up  to  a  whole  day  while  Romanian  authorities 
searched  their  cars  and  baggage.  Many  Hungarians  were  not  al- 
lowed to  enter  Romania  after  the  seizure  of  books,  periodicals,  and 
even  HSWP  and  Hungarian  government  newspapers. 

The  Hungarian  regime  failed  to  respond  quickly  to  the  Roma- 
nian actions.  As  Austrian  political  commentator  Paul  Lendvai  has 
noted,  because  all  communist  countries  are,  according  to  their  offi- 
cial definition,  brothers,  they  must  bury  the  differences  that  fre- 
quently appear  between  noncommunist  states.  Therefore,  until  the 
mid-1980s  the  regime  remained  silent  about  the  treatment  of  Hun- 
garians in  neighboring  countries.  For  example,  after  a  high-level 
Romanian  delegation  visited  Hungary  in  April  1985,  the  joint  com- 
munique contained  no  reference  to  Romania's  nationality  problem. 

Beginning  in  1984,  however,  Hungarian  criticisms  of  Romania 
began  to  surface  in  the  media,  and  Hungarian  leaders  began  to 
develop  their  own  position  on  minority  nationalities.  In  August 
1984,  the  deputy  prime  minister,  Lajos  Faluvegi,  criticized  Roma- 
nia's treatment  of  its  minorities.  In  a  November  1984  speech  to 
the  Thirteenth  Party  Congress  of  the  Romanian  Communist  Party 
(RCP),  National  Council  of  Trade  Unions  secretary  Lajos  Mehes 
echoed  Faluvegi' s  comments.  The  Thirteenth  Party  Congress 
of  the  HSWP  in  1985  also  addressed  this  problem.  Kadar  twice 
spoke  about  the  need  to  respect  the  rights,  language,  and  cul- 
ture of  national  minorities  and  to  allow  them  freedom  of  move- 
ment and  contacts  with  their  mother  country.  Kadar  emphasized 


211 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

that  national  minorities  ought  to  act  as  a  bridge  between  neigh- 
boring countries. 

In  June  1987,  at  a  meeting  with  a  Romanian  delegation  headed 
by  Emil  Bobu,  an  RCP  Politburo  member  and  Central  Committee 
secretary  for  party  organization,  Hungarian  officials  brought  up  the 
problem  of  Romania's  treatment  of  its  Hungarian  population.  Hun- 
gary maintained  that  Romania's  treatment  of  Hungarians  failed  to 
comply  with  a  1977  agreement  between  Kadar  and  Romanian  leader 
Nicolae  Ceausescu  to  strengthen  friendship  and  cooperation  between 
the  two  peoples  and  to  develop  good  relations  between  the  two  coun- 
tries. However,  the  two  sides  failed  to  reach  an  agreement  on  the 
minority  problem.  Hungary  wanted  Hungarians  in  Romania  to  be 
loyal  citizens  of  that  country  but  to  preserve  their  language  and  cul- 
ture and  be  considered  equals  in  "building  socialism."  Hungary 
agreed  that  the  problem  could  be  setded  only  by  Romania.  However, 
the  Romanian  report  of  the  meeting  failed  to  mention  that  the  two 
sides  had  discussed  the  problem. 

Hungary  took  the  unprecedented  step  of  raising  the  minority 
issue  at  multilateral  forums.  In  October  1985,  Hungary  addressed 
this  problem  at  the  Cultural  Forum  of  the  Conference  on  Security 
and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE).  A  representative  of  the  Hun- 
garian delegation  revealed  that  Hungary,  Poland,  the  Soviet  Union, 
and  East  Germany  prepared  a  proposal  "about  the  assertion  by 
national  minorities  of  their  cultural  rights"  in  which  Romania  and 
Czechoslovakia  did  not  participate.  More  important,  on  Novem- 
ber 15  Marton  Klein,  a  department  head  in  the  Ministry  of  For- 
eign Affairs,  condemned  the  oppression  of  3  million  Hungarians 
in  neighboring  countries.  He  called  for  guarantees  of  the  minori- 
ties' civil  rights  and  for  granting  them  specific  collective  rights  to 
use  their  language  to  enable  them  to  preserve  and  enhance  their 
cultural  traditions. 

In  March  1987,  at  a  closed  session  of  the  CSCE  review  confer- 
ence in  Vienna,  the  Hungarian  delegation  supported  proposals  for 
protecting  minority  rights  submitted  by  Yugoslavia  and  Canada. 
This  action  marked  the  first  time  a  Soviet  ally  supported  a  Western 
proposal  at  a  CSCE  review  conference.  Hungary  faced  heavy  pres- 
sure from  its  allies  for  this  decision.  In  April,  Hungary  responded 
to  Romanian  criticisms  of  its  "diversionary  moves"  and  "nation- 
alist" and  "chauvinist"  practices.  Rezso  Banyasz,  head  of  the 
Council  of  Ministers'  Information  Bureau,  argued  that  the  Roma- 
nian charges  lacked  foundation  and  damaged  the  basic  interests 
of  the  Romanian  and  Hungarian  peoples. 

Relations  between  Hungary  and  Romania  further  deterio- 
rated in  1988.  Thousands  of  ethnic  Hungarians  (and  some  ethnic 


212 


Government  and  Politics 


Romanians)  were  fleeing  from  Romania  to  Hungary  to  escape 
Ceau§escu's  political  oppression.  The  National  Assembly  passed 
a  resolution  calling  Romania's  planned  destruction  of  thousands 
of  villages  a  violation  of  human  rights.  The  razing  of  between  7,000 
and  8,000  villages  and  the  relocation  of  their  inhabitants  were  not 
directed  at  minorities  as  such,  but  the  minorities  would  suffer  the 
most  because  they  would  be  scattered  throughout  the  country  and 
lose  their  national  identities.  In  July  tens  of  thousands  of  Hungar- 
ians demonstrated  in  front  of  the  Romanian  embassy  in  Budapest 
against  the  destruction  of  the  villages.  In  response,  Ceau§escu 
threatened  to  close  the  Romanian  embassy,  closed  the  Hungarian 
consulate  in  Cluj-Napoca,  and  blamed  Hungary  for  the  worsen- 
ing of  relations. 

Grosz  and  Ceau§escu  held  an  impromptu  meeting  in  Arad, 
Romania,  on  August  28,  1988,  to  discuss  relations  between  their 
countries.  The  talks  lasted  eight  hours  but  failed  to  produce  tangi- 
ble results.  The  joint  communique  did  not  mention  the  national- 
ity issue.  Hungary  later  conceded  that  the  two  sides  had  made  no 
progress  on  this  problem. 

On  November  14,  1988,  relations  fell  to  a  new  low  when  Roma- 
nian police  arrested  Karoly  Gyorffy,  the  Hungarian  commercial 
counselor,  in  Bucharest.  The  Romanians  accused  Gyorffy  of  using 
a  stolen  automobile,  causing  a  serious  accident,  and  distributing 
leaflets  inciting  public  opinion  against  the  authorities.  On  November 
19,  Romania  declared  Gyorffy  persona  non  grata  and  instructed 
him  to  leave  the  country  within  three  days.  Hungary  rejected  all 
accusations  against  Gyorffy  and  noted  that  this  incident  did  not 
mark  the  first  time  that  Romanian  organs  had  hindered  the  work 
of  its  diplomats.  On  November  24,  Hungary  expelled  Romania's 
political  counselor. 

Czechoslovakia 

Since  the  formation  in  Slovakia  (Czechoslovakia's  eastern  repub- 
lic) of  a  dissident  organization  for  the  defense  of  the  rights  of  Hun- 
garians in  1979  and  after  frequent  arrests  of  the  Hungarian  activist 
Miklos  Duray,  discrimination  against  the  approximately  600,000 
ethnic  Hungarians  in  Czechoslovakia  became  a  problem  in  the  re- 
lations between  the  two  communist  neighbors.  As  of  1986,  about 
100  Hungarian  activists  had  been  arrested  and  imprisoned  by 
Czechoslovak  authorities.  Other  problems  included  the  lack  of 
Hungarian-language  books  and  newspapers  in  Slovakia,  discourage- 
ment of  Hungarian-language  training,  and  vandalism  of  Hungar- 
ian monuments  and  cultural  offices.

Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

In  the  late  1980s,  as  a  result  of  pressure  from  Hungary,  Czecho- 
slovakia attempted  to  redress  some  of  the  Hungarian  minority's 
complaints.  In  1986  the  two  countries  concluded  an  agreement  that 
called  for  Hungarian  construction  of  a  Hungarian  cultural  center 
in  Bratislava,  the  capital  of  Slovakia.  In  1987  the  Cultural  Associ- 
ation of  Hungarian  Workers  in  Czechoslovakia  was  allowed  to  re- 
join the  Czechoslovak  National  Front,  from  which  it  had  been 
expelled  in  1972.  Yet  Czechoslovakia  attempted  to  downplay  the 
minority  problem.  In  the  communique  issued  following  the  meet- 
ing between  Grosz  and  Czechoslovak  prime  minister  Lubomfr 
Strougal  in  August  1987,  Strougal  mentioned  the  minority  issue 
only  in  passing.  By  contrast,  Grosz  noted  the  role  of  minorities 
as  a  bridge  between  Hungary  and  Czechoslovakia  and  called  for 
greater  cultural  contacts  between  the  two  countries. 

Another  outstanding  issue  between  Hungary  and  Czechoslovakia 
concerned  the  Gabcikovo-Nagymaros  Dam  project.  In  1977  the 
two  countries  agreed  to  build  this  hydroelectric  power  and  navi- 
gation system  on  the  Danube  River  between  Bratislava  and 
Budapest.  Hungarian  public  opinion  strongly  protested  the  project. 
Environmental  activists  in  Hungary  claimed  that  the  project  would 
severely  damage  the  potable  water  supply,  agriculture,  and  forests 
of  both  countries.  Czechoslovakia  has  pressured  the  Hungarian 
government  to  proceed  more  quickly  with  the  project. 

Yugoslavia 

In  the  late  1980s,  approximately  430,000  Hungarians  lived  in 
Yugoslavia,  primarily  in  the  autonomous  province  of  Vojvodina. 
In  the  late  1980s,  relations  between  Hungary  and  Yugoslavia  were 
good.  After  a  December  1986  visit  to  Yugoslavia,  Hungarian  prime 
minister  Gyorgy  Lazar  termed  "exemplary"  Yugoslavia's  treat- 
ment of  its  Hungarian  minority.  Yugoslavia  provided  an  adequate 
number  of  Hungarian-language  schools  on  all  educational  levels 
to  this  minority.  In  addition,  the  Yugoslav  government  freely  per- 
mitted the  publication  and  dissemination  of  periodicals  and 
newspapers  in  the  Hungarian  language. 

In  other  areas,  bilateral  ties  developed  remarkably  well.  Since 
the  1970s,  Hungary  has  maintained  governmental  relations  with 
the  various  republics  of  Yugoslavia.  The  two  countries  also  under- 
took a  variety  of  successful  economic  and  scientific-technical  ven- 
tures. In  1985  Hungary  and  Yugoslavia  signed  a  trade  agreement 
worth  US$4.8  billion.  In  the  late  1980s,  each  side  expressed  its  read- 
iness to  increase  cooperation  in  culture,  education,  information  ex- 
change, and  sports.

Government  and  Politics 


Relations  with  the  West 

In  the  1970s  and  1980s,  the  consensus  between  regime  and  so- 
ciety in  Hungary  called  for  political  support  for  the  regime  in  return 
for  improvements  in  the  standard  of  living  and  a  loosening  of  re- 
gime controls  over  society.  Hungary  needed  Western  economic  sup- 
port to  raise  its  standard  of  living.  Western  economic  support  also 
entailed  a  modicum  of  political  support.  Hungary  put  out  feelers 
to  Austria  as  early  as  1964  and  sought  to  use  that  country — a  per- 
manent neutral — as  a  bridge  to  the  West.  Subsequendy,  the  Hun- 
garians turned  to  West  Germany,  historically  the  country's  most 
important  trade  partner  in  Central  Europe.  In  the  mid-  to  late 
1980s,  Hungary  has  also  sought  to  improve  relations  with  Britain 
and  the  United  States.  In  each  case,  Hungary  wanted  increased 
trade  and  cultural  contacts.  By  contrast,  in  1988  Hungary  had  only 
begun  to  cultivate  relations  with  France,  and  economic  and  cul- 
tural contacts  with  that  country  therefore  remained  at  a  low  level. 

Austria 

Since  the  mid-1960s,  good  relations  between  Hungary  and  Aus- 
tria have  resulted  from  a  number  of  factors.  A  common  water  sys- 
tem, including  the  Danube,  the  Drava,  and  the  Mur  rivers,  together 
with  countless  smaller  rivers  and  Lake  Ferto  (Neusiedlersee),  meant 
each  country's  use  of  it  affected  the  other  country.  Means  of  trans- 
portation, including  road  and  railroad  connections  such  as  the 
Raba-Odenburger  railroad  line,  also  drew  the  countries  together. 
Equally  important,  in  the  mid-1960s  each  country  came  to  accept 
the  permanence  of  the  other's  social  system  and  attempted  to  find 
common  areas  of  agreement  despite  political  differences.  Finally, 
in  1981  the  two  countries  agreed  that  the  border,  which  had  earlier 
caused  discord,  no  longer  presented  a  problem. 

In  the  1980s,  economic  relations  between  Hungary  and  Austria 
were  quite  strong.  More  than  100  cooperation  agreements  in  areas 
such  as  machine-building,  metallurgy,  pharmaceuticals,  agricul- 
ture, and  light  industry  were  in  force  between  the  two  countries. 
In  1986  total  trade  between  the  two  countries  amounted  to  US$1 . 1 
billion.  Hungary  was  Austria's  fourth  largest  trade  partner  over- 
all, and  Austria  was  Hungary's  second  largest  Western  trade 
partner. 

The  two  countries  also  cooperated  considerably  in  culture,  science 
and  technology,  sports,  and  other  fields.  The  Hungarian  Cultural 
Institute  in  Vienna  organized  an  average  of  fifty  events  per  year, 
and  the  Austrians  operated  their  own  cultural  institute  in  Budapest. 
In  1987  the  Hungarian- Austrian  Friends  Circle  was  established  to 


215 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

promote  common  cultural  traditions  and  Hungarian  interest  in  Aus- 
trian history  and  culture.  In  the  late  1980s,  the  theme  that  the  two 
countries  shared  "a  special  relationship"  has  recurred  in  both 
governments'  commentaries  on  their  political  relations.  The  Hun- 
garian media  also  stressed  the  Central  European  identity  and  in- 
terests common  to  the  two  countries. 

West  Germany 

Since  the  early  1970s,  when  the  Four  Power  Agreement  on  Ber- 
lin and  the  Basic  Treaty  between  East  Germany  and  West  Ger- 
many normalized  West  Germany's  relations  with  the  Soviet  Union 
and  East  Germany,  respectively,  Hungary  has  greatly  expanded 
its  ties  with  West  Germany.  After  West  German  chancellor  Helmut 
Kohl's  visit  to  Hungary  in  1984,  the  Hungarian  press  stressed  the 
special  place  of  West  Germany  in  Hungary's  foreign  policy  and 
West  Germany's  efforts  to  reduce  tension  between  East  and  West. 
Nepszabadsdg  called  Kohl  "the  patron  of  East- West  relations."  Over 
the  course  of  the  1980s,  political  contacts  and  dialogue  have  been 
constant  and  frequent,  despite  problems  in  superpower  relations. 

For  Hungary,  West  Germany  has  served  as  an  economic  gate- 
way to  the  West.  In  the  late  1980s,  West  Germany  was  Hungary's 
largest  Western  trading  partner.  As  of  1984,  332  cooperation  agree- 
ments linked  the  economies  of  the  two  countries.  That  same  year, 
the  two  countries  extended  a  ten-year  agreement  on  economic,  in- 
dustrial, and  technical  cooperation  signed  in  1974.  In  1987  Hun- 
gary and  West  Germany  signed  a  five-year  agreement  on  scientific 
and  technical  cooperation. 

Cultural  relations  between  the  two  countries  also  expanded.  In 
1987  the  two  governments  agreed  to  set  up  cultural  and  informa- 
tion centers  in  each  other's  country  and  concluded  a  visa  agree- 
ment easing  restrictions  on  Hungarians  trying  to  enter  West 
Germany.  The  West  Germans  also  praised  Hungary's  treatment 
of  its  German  minority  and  its  policy  of  allowing  ethnic  Germans 
to  resettle  in  West  Germany. 

Britain 

To  diversify  support  for  its  economic  reforms,  in  the  mid-1980s 
Hungary  began  to  pursue  relations  with  Britain.  In  1984  Britain 
accounted  for  4.3  percent  of  Hungary's  exports  to  the  West  and 
5.2  percent  of  its  imports  from  the  West.  In  the  mid-1980s,  Hun- 
gary was  able  to  increase  its  trade  with  Britain  owing  to  Britain's 
recovery  from  its  economic  recession,  the  flexible  price  policy  of 
Hungarian  economic  enterprises,  and  a  more  favorable  interna- 
tional climate.

Kadar  paid  an  official  visit  to  Britain  in  the  fall  of  1 985 .  Accord- 
ing to  British  prime  minister  Margaret  Thatcher,  the  two  sides 
shared  common  ideas  "with  regard  to  peace,  prosperity,  and  secu- 
rity." The  two  governments  admitted  that  differences  persisted, 
although  they  agreed  to  play  a  "useful  role"  in  creating  good  re- 
lations between  the  Warsaw  Pact  and  NATO. 

The  good  political  climate  facilitated  the  expansion  of  cultural 
relations.  Hungary  and  Britain  carried  out  bilateral  cultural  and 
scientific  exchanges  within  the  context  of  an  agreement  that  was 
renewed  every  two  years.  In  1985  Glasgow  held  a  five-week  fes- 
tival of  Hungarian  culture.  In  addition,  the  British  firm  Perga- 
mon  Press  published  an  English  translation  of  Kadar' s  speeches 
and  articles. 

United  States 

Relations  between  Hungary  and  the  United  States  began  to  warm 
in  1978  when  the  United  States  returned  the  Crown  of  Saint 
Stephen  to  Hungary  (the  crown  had  fallen  into  American  hands 
after  World  War  II).  High-level  political  contacts  took  place  rather 
frequently  in  the  1980s.  Hungary  benefited  from  these  contacts  be- 
cause the  United  States  kept  it  abreast  of  the  course  of  Soviet-United

States  arms  control  negotiations.  In  1986  Secretary  of  State  George 
Shultz  visited  Hungary,  and  in  1987  Central  Committee  secretary 
Szuros  visited  the  United  States.  In  the  summer  of  1988,  General 
Secretary  Grosz  paid  a  ten-day  visit  to  the  United  States. 

Hungary  has  taken  certain  steps  to  improve  its  relations  with 
the  United  States.  The  Department  of  State  has  reacted  favorably 
to  Hungary's  efforts  in  the  area  of  human  rights.  United  States 
officials  have  also  praised  the  introduction  of  market  mechanisms 
in  the  Hungarian  economy. 

In  1986  trade  between  Hungary  and  the  United  States  amounted 
to  US$345  million.  The  Hungarian  government  sought  the  renewal 
of  most-favored-nation  status  on  a  three-year  cycle  rather  than  an- 
nually to  facilitate  planning  in  the  foreign  trade  sector.  During  his 
visit  in  1988,  Grosz  devoted  most  of  his  attention  to  economic  mat- 
ters, seeking  to  encourage  greater  and  more  varied  cooperation  be- 
tween the  two  countries.  The  United  States  responded  by  allowing 
Hungary  to  open  a  trade  bureau  on  the  Pacific  coast. 

Relations  with  Selected  Non-Western  Countries 

In  the  mid-  to  late  1980s,  Hungary  began  to  forge  new  economic 
and  political  relations  with  three  countries  that  had  long  been  ig- 
nored by  most  other  countries  in  Eastern  Europe.  Hungary  had 
broken  off  political  relations  with  Israel  in  1967,  all  but  cut  off  re- 
lations with  China  as  a  result  of  the  Sino-Soviet  split,  and  neglected 
South  Korea  for  fear  of  angering  the  communist  Democratic  Peo- 
ple's Republic  of  Korea  (North  Korea).  Given  the  varying  circum- 
stances of  these  countries,  Hungary  had  different  reasons  for  seeking 
to  reopen  relations  with  them,  although  in  the  case  of  all  three  coun- 
tries, economic  relations  figured  prominently.  The  Hungarians 
sought  to  develop  trade  and  commercial  ties  with  Israel.  Hungary 
and  China  shared  an  interest  in  economic  and  political  reform. 
South  Korea  provided  a  key  to  opening  Hungarian  relations  with 
the  newly  industrialized  countries  of  the  Pacific  Basin. 

Israel 

On  September  14,  1987,  Israel  and  Hungary  agreed  to  open  in- 
terest sections  with  a  maximum  of  five  diplomats  in  each  other's 
countries.  The  Hungarian  interest  section  in  Tel  Aviv  was  to  have 
been  established  at  the  Swedish  embassy  and  the  Israeli  interest 
section  in  Budapest  at  the  Swiss  embassy.  This  low  level  of  diplo- 
matic representation  was  to  facilitate  economic,  trade,  cultural,  and 
humanitarian  cooperation  between  the  two  countries  and  to  help 
remove  obstacles  to  consular  relations. 


218 


Government  and  Politics 


In  1988  both  Israeli  foreign  minister  Shimon  Peres  and  Israeli 
prime  minister  Yitzhak  Shamir  visited  Hungary.  Hungary  desig- 
nated Shamir's  visit  as  private  to  avoid  offending  Arab  states.  Hun- 
gary sought  to  use  both  visits  to  strengthen  trade  and  cultural 
relations  with  Israel.  Western  observers  regarded  these  high-level 
contacts  as  another  step  toward  the  reestablishment  of  full  diplo- 
matic relations. 

China 

In  the  late  1970s,  Hungary  began  working  toward  better  rela- 
tions with  China.  Trade  and  economic  relations  began  to  expand 
in  1983,  followed  by  the  improvement  of  interstate  relations 
and  cultural  ties.  However,  because  of  ideological  differences, 
Hungarian-Chinese  relations  focused  on  economic  ties.  In  1985 
the  two  countries  signed  a  long-term  foreign  trade  agreement  to 
expand  bilateral  economic  and  trade  cooperation.  The  two  coun- 
tries also  agreed  to  exchange  information  on  their  economic  re- 
form efforts.  Imports  from  China  rose  from  0.6  percent  of 
Hungary's  total  in  1984  to  1.8  percent  of  the  total  in  1986.  Ex- 
ports to  China  rose  from  0.8  percent  of  the  total  to  1.9  percent 
of  the  total  in  that  same  period.  Hungarians  participated  in  sev- 
eral Chinese  industrial  development  and  reconstruction  programs. 

By  1982  both  communist  parties  began  to  show  an  interest  in 
resuming  political  relations.  In  1985  the  HSWP  sent  the  Chinese 
Communist  Party  (CCP)  the  guidelines  for  its  Thirteenth  Party 
Congress.  In  return,  the  CCP  sent  a  message  to  the  "dear  com- 
rades" of  the  HSWP,  wishing  the  Hungarian  people  success  in 
the  building  of  socialism. 

Political  relations  intensified  in  1987.  In  June  Chinese  premier 
and  acting  general  secretary  of  the  CCP  Zhao  Ziyang  visited  Hun- 
gary. Kadar's  visit  to  China  in  October  1987  marked  the  resump- 
tion of  party-to-party  relations.  The  Chinese  praised  Hungary's 
reform  program  and  called  Kadar's  visit  "historic"  because  it  sym- 
bolized a  new  era  of  friendship  and  cooperation  between  the  two 
peoples. 

South  Korea 

In  February  1989,  Hungary  and  South  Korea  agreed  to  estab- 
lish full  diplomatic  relations.  Hungary  thus  became  the  first  com- 
munist country  to  recognize  South  Korea.  South  Korea  was  one 
of  the  most  developed  countries  in  Asia,  and  the  Hungarians  sought 
South  Korea's  assistance  in  developing  their  economy.  In  addi- 
tion, Central  Committee  secretary  Sziiros  argued  that  economic 
ties  to  South  Korea  would  facilitate  the  development  of  ties  with

other  countries  of  East  Asia  and  the  Pacific  Basin  and  the  increase 
of  foreign  economic  assistance  to  develop  Hungary's  economy. 

Hungary  and  the  Soviet  Model 

Hungary's  interest  in  economic  reform  prompted  not  only  po- 
litical reform  but  also  changes  in  its  foreign  policy  stance.  The  re- 
gime found  that  successful  economic  reform  required  political 
reform  to  encourage  greater  popular  participation  in  governmen- 
tal affairs  and  an  increase  in  regime  legitimacy.  Thus,  the  regime 
took  certain  steps  to  expand  political  participation  and  to  promote 
more  individual  freedom.  Successful  economic  reform  also  neces- 
sitated changes  in  Hungary's  relationship  to  the  world  economy. 
Hungary  developed  and  diversified  its  relations  with  many  Western 
countries  and  with  several  non- Western  countries.  Political  reforms 
also  encouraged  Western  countries,  particularly  the  United  States, 
to  furnish  economic  assistance  to  Hungary.  Domestic  economic 
reform  therefore  provided  the  impetus  for  Hungary's  willingness 
to  emancipate  itself,  if  only  to  a  small  degree,  from  both  the  Soviet 
political  model  and  Soviet  foreign  policy  tutelage. 

In  1989  monographs  on  Hungary's  political  system  and  foreign 
policy  remained  scarce.  Hans-Georg  Heinrich's  Hungary:  Politics, 
Economics,  and  Society  presents  an  overview  of  the  government,  state, 
and  party  structures.  Baruch  Hazan's  The  East  European  Political 
System,  although  a  general  work,  contains  some  useful  information 
about  Hungary.  Peter  Toma's  Socialist  Authority  also  provides  mate- 
rial on  the  political  system.  For  most  aspects  of  government  and 
politics,  the  interested  reader  is  encouraged  to  turn  to  more  spe- 
cialized works.  Istvan  Kovacs's  "The  Development  of  the  Con- 
stitution of  the  Hungarian  People's  Republic"  discusses  the 
Constitution.  Heinrich's  Verfassungswirklichkeit  in  Osteuropa  contains 
much  material  on  the  Presidential  Council.  Barnabas  Racz's  "Po- 
litical Participation  and  Developed  Socialism:  The  Hungarian  Elec- 
tions of  1985"  is  the  best  secondary  source  on  the  electoral  system. 
George  Schopflin's  Censorship  and  Political  Communication  in  Eastern 
Europe  provides  a  perspective  on  the  media.  The  best  writings  on 
foreign  policy  are  the  reports  prepared  by  analysts  at  Radio  Free 
Europe,  particularly  those  by  Alfred  Reisch.  In  addition,  an  ac- 
count of  Hungary's  attempts  to  develop  a  new  foreign  policy  role 
for  itself  is  found  in  works  by  Gyula  Jozsa.  (For  further  informa-

Chapter  5.  National  Security 


Two  soldiers,  Esztergom,  1918 


THE  HUNGARIAN  PEOPLE'S  ARMY  (HP A)  of  the  late  1980s 
comprised  ground  and  air  forces  under  the  supervision  of  the  Minis- 
try of  Defense.  The  ground  forces  accounted  for  more  than  77  per- 
cent of  the  total  strength  of  the  HPA,  which  in  1989  numbered 
slightly  less  than  100,000  troops.  The  armed  forces  that  constituted 
the  HPA  were  committed  by  treaty  to  the  Soviet-East  European 
alliance  known  as  the  Warsaw  Pact.  Another  military  force,  the 
Border  Guard,  which  patrolled  the  country's  frontiers,  was  super- 
vised by  the  Ministry  of  Interior,  as  were  the  National  Police  and 
the  Security  Police.  Hungary  had  no  uniformed  state  security  police. 
The  Workers'  Guard,  a  part-time  force  similar  to  a  national  guard 
was  an  arm  of  the  Hungarian  Socialist  Workers'  Party.  The  HPA 
and  the  Border  Guard  obtained  manpower  through  a  system  of 
universal  male  conscription;  service  in  the  other  organizations  was 
voluntary.  A  small  number  of  women  also  served  in  the  armed 
forces  in  auxiliary  roles  but  were  not  subject  to  conscription. 

Political  changes  in  Hungary  and  the  Soviet  Union  in  the  late 
1980s  promised  drastic  changes  in  the  HPA's  relationship  to  the 
party  and  to  the  Warsaw  Pact.  Reformers  proposed  removing  the 
national  security  forces  from  tight  party  control  to  reduce  the  likeli- 
hood that  they  would  be  used  for  domestic  political  coercion.  The 
lessening  of  tensions  in  Europe  had  allowed  the  financially  strapped 
Hungarian  government  to  severely  cut  its  military  budget  without 
fearing  domestic  or  international  reprisal.  Both  Soviet  and  Hun- 
garian officials  spoke  cautiously  of  the  possibility  of  a  politically  and 
militarily  neutral  Hungary.  In  1989  the  Soviet  Union  had  begun 
withdrawing  a  small  portion  of  its  65,000  troops  stationed  in  Hun- 
gary. Ironically,  by  the  late  1980s  many  Hungarians  viewed  this 
withdrawal  with  dismay  because  they  had  begun  to  see  the  Soviet 
forces  in  their  country  as  protection  against  an  increasingly  mili- 
tant Romania. 

Political  liberalization  also  encouraged  changes  in  the  criminal 
justice  system.  Regime  leaders  promised  to  depoliticize  the  adminis- 
tration of  justice  and  the  police,  although  as  of  1989  the  apparatus 
of  repression  remained  intact.  However,  harsh  measures  against 
dissent  and  public  demonstrations,  which  had  been  taken  as  late 
as  1986,  had  stopped  by  1989. 

Historical  and  Political  Setting 

Hungary  had  a  glorious  military  tradition  in  the  Middle  Ages. 
However,  long  resistance  to  the  Ottoman  Turks  left  Hungary  weak, 


223 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


and  the  country  was  eventually  partitioned  by  the  Turks  and  the 
Habsburgs  in  1541.  Thereafter — except  for  the  period  between 
World  War  I  and  World  War  II — Hungary's  armed  forces  have 
been  subject  to  those  of  an  outside  power,  first  the  Habsburg  im- 
perial army  and  then,  after  World  War  II,  the  Soviet-dominated 
Warsaw  Pact. 

Hungary  has  played  less  of  a  role  in  the  Soviet  alliance  system 
than  the  other  Warsaw  Pact  countries  except  for  Romania.  It  had 
the  smallest  army  in  the  Warsaw  Pact  (see  Glossary).  Unlike  the 
German  Democratic  Republic  (East  Germany)  and  Czechoslovakia, 
which  border  on  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West  Ger- 
many), Hungary  does  not  border  on  a  member  of  the  North  Atlantic 
Treaty  Organization  (NATO). 

Historical  Background  and  Traditions 

Since  the  Magyars'  conquest  of  the  Carpathian  Basin  in  896, 
Hungarians  have  had  to  be  concerned  about  their  national  secu- 
rity. Twice  in  Hungary's  history,  a  foreign  invader  killed  nearly 
half  of  the  country's  population,  and  at  other  times  Hungarians 
had  to  endure  occupation  by  a  foreign  power  seeking  to  destroy 
their  national  identity.  For  this  reason,  a  military  leader  who  deliv- 
ered the  people,  however  temporarily,  from  foreign  oppression  be- 
came a  hero. 

The  Medieval  Period 

Before  the  Magyar  tribes  conquered  the  Carpathian  Basin  in  896, 
they  lived  a  seminomadic  life  on  the  Russian  steppe  (see  Early  His- 
tory, ch.  1).  Their  military  organization  and  weaponry  resembled 
those  of  various  Bulgar- Turkish  tribes  who  also  inhabited  the  steppe 
at  that  time.  Riding  on  swift  steppe  ponies,  the  Magyar  horsemen 
used  recurved  bows  for  battie  at  long  distance,  and  they  used  sabers, 
short  lances,  axes,  and  clubs  for  hand-to-hand  combat.  In  the  ninth 
century,  Arab  historians  wrote  that  the  Magyars  could  muster 
20,000  horsemen  for  battle. 

In  the  mid-  to  late  ninth  century,  the  Magyar  tribes  inhabited 
the  territory  lying  to  the  north  of  the  Black  Sea  between  the  lower 
Don  and  lower  Dnepr  rivers.  From  there  they  made  armed  forays 
against  kingdoms  to  the  west,  first  against  the  Bulgars  on  the  lower 
Danube  in  839  and  then  in  862  against  Pannonia  (see  Glossary), 
which  at  that  time  was  part  of  the  eastern  Frankish  Kingdom. 

In  the  last  decade  of  the  ninth  century,  the  Magyar  tribes  en- 
gaged in  a  series  of  military  actions  that  culminated  in  their  con- 
quest of  the  Carpathian  Basin.  From  892  to  894,  they  raided 
Moravia  (in  what  is  today  the  central  part  of  Czechoslovakia)  and 


224 


National  Security 


Pannonia,  gaining  valuable  knowledge  about  the  fortified  passes 
in  the  Carpathian  Mountains,  the  natural  defenses  of  their  future 
homeland.  In  894-95  three  Magyar  forces  were  operating  in  the 
Danube  Basin — one  allied  with  Byzantium  against  the  Bulgars  in 
the  south,  one  allied  with  the  Franks  against  Moravia  in  Pannonia, 
and  a  third  that  was  invading  what  is  now  the  Trans-Carpathian 
oblast  in  the  Soviet  Ukraine.  With  most  of  their  armed  men  away 
in  battle,  the  Magyars  remaining  in  the  Dnieper-Dnestr  region 
could  offer  little  resistance  to  the  Pechenegs,  a  steppe  people  who 
attacked  them  from  the  east.  Suffering  great  material  losses,  the 
Magyars  on  the  steppe  fled  westward,  through  the  Carpathian 
mountain  passes,  into  their  future  homeland. 

Even  though  their  conquest  of  the  Carpathian  Basin  was  not  yet 
complete,  in  899  the  Magyars  launched  their  first  plundering  ex- 
pedition against  the  rest  of  Europe.  Terrorizing  Europe  for  more 
than  half  a  century,  the  Magyar  raiders  reached  southern  Italy, 
France,  Spain,  northern  Germany,  Greece,  and  even  the  gates  of 
Constantinople.  However,  the  raids  against  Western  Europe  ended 
when  in  955  the  Magyars  suffered  a  disastrous  defeat  near  Augs- 
burg (in  Bavaria)  against  a  coalition  headed  by  the  Holy  Roman 
Emperor,  Otto  II. 

Hungary  was  one  of  the  strongest  military  powers  in  Europe  for 
nearly  250  years  following  its  establishment  as  a  kingdom  in  A.D. 
1000  (see  Medieval  Period,  ch.  1).  Engaging  in  small  wars  for  either 
territorial  or  dynastic  reasons,  the  country  successfully  resisted  Ger- 
man and  Byzantine  attempts  to  meddle  in  its  internal  affairs. 
However,  Hungarian  armies  could  not  stop  the  Mongols,  who  in- 
vaded the  country  in  1241.  Although  the  attack  was  expected  and 
the  border  fortifications  reinforced,  the  Mongols  easily  swept 
through  the  Carpathian  passes  into  the  Danube  Plain  in  March 
1241 .  In  April  the  Hungarian  army  met  one  of  the  Mongol  armies 
in  the  area  between  present-day  Leninvaros  and  Miskolc.  The  Hun- 
garian force  was  surrounded  and  totally  annihilated  at  Mohi,  but 
Hungary's  King  Bela  IV  managed  to  elude  the  Mongols  and  escape. 

The  Mongol  occupation  was  brief  but  devastating,  wiping  out 
at  least  half  the  population.  The  country  soon  recovered  economi- 
cally but  remained  militarily  weakened  until  the  beginning  of  the 
fourteenth  century.  Charles  Robert  (1308-42),  the  first  Anjou  king 
of  Hungary,  required  the  nobles  to  maintain  small  armed  units, 
or  banderia,  which  served  as  a  reserve  force  in  addition  to  the  no- 
bility and  mercenaries  serving  in  the  royal  army.  This  renewed 
military  strength,  combined  with  the  fact  that  Hungary's  neigh- 
bors were  either  militarily  weak  or  preoccupied  elsewhere,  helped 
create  a  relatively  peaceful  Eastern  Europe  in  the  fourteenth

century.  Even  the  increasing  threat  from  the  Ottoman  Turks,  start- 
ing in  the  1360s,  was  successfully  resisted  during  this  time. 

The  Modem  Period 

In  the  fifteenth  century  lived  Janos  Hunyadi,  perhaps  the  greatest 
Hungarian  general  of  all  time  (see  Renaissance  and  Reformation, 
ch.  1).  Although  Hunyadi  fought,  not  always  successfully,  against 
the  Turks  several  times  in  the  1440s,  he  is  best  known  for  his  vic- 
tory against  them  near  Belgrade  in  1456.  There  the  Hungarian 
forces  decisively  defeated  the  Turkish  army  and  sent  the  sultan  into 
flight.  However,  the  Turkish  wars,  together  with  the  petty  strug- 
gles on  the  western  borderlands,  drained  the  national  treasury,  and 
increasingly  heavy  taxation  and  feudal  obligations  pushed  the 
peasantry  into  a  rebellion  that  was  eventually  crushed.  The  coun- 
try was  economically  weakened  and  racked  by  political  instability, 
and  its  military  might  declined  precipitously  after  the  death  of  King 
Matyas  Corvinus  in  1490. 

The  Ottoman  Turks  threatened  to  invade  in  the  1520s,  but  the 
Hungarian  nobility  seemed  oblivious.  The  Turks  successfully  at- 
tacked Belgrade  in  1521,  and  on  August  29,  1526,  met  the  small, 
poorly  equipped  Hungarian  army  at  Mohacs.  The  Hungarian 
forces  were  nearly  wiped  out,  and  their  king,  Louis  II,  died  in  the 
rout.  The  Turks  captured  Buda  in  early  September  but  then  re- 
treated southward,  loaded  with  captives,  and  having  no  intention 
of  permanently  occupying  Hungary.  However,  the  struggle  between 
the  Habsburgs  and  the  Hungarian  contenders  for  the  Hungarian 
throne  pulled  the  Turks  deeper  into  Hungarian  politics,  leading 
to  their  military  occupation  of  Buda  in  1541  and  the  entire  Hun- 
garian plain  soon  afterward.  The  Habsburg  emperor  was  left  with 
a  strip  of  land  in  northeastern  Hungary  (called  "Royal  Hungary"), 
while  Transylvania  remained  nominally  independent  under  Tur- 
kish suzerainty  (see  fig.  3).  The  section  of  Hungary  directly  under 
Ottoman  rule  became  a  wasteland,  as  various  Turkish  military  for- 
mations periodically  looted  and  destroyed  settlements,  killing  the 
inhabitants  or  selling  them  into  slavery. 

In  Royal  Hungary,  the  Habsburgs  constructed  a  system  of  for- 
tifications along  the  border  with  Ottoman  Hungary  during  the 
seventeenth  century.  Many  Hungarian  nobles,  having  fled  the  Turk- 
ish zone  of  occupation,  assumed  military  leadership  of  important 
sectors  of  this  border  zone.  Their  serfs  were  obliged  to  work  twelve 
days  annually  on  border  fortifications,  to  perform  military  service, 
and  to  pay  a  military  tax.  Several  Hungarian  military  leaders  during 
this  time  achieved  fame  for  their  exploits.  Miklos  Znnyi's  heroic 
stand  against  the  Turks  in  1564  and  Istvan  Bocskay's  victory  over 


226 


National  Security 


the  Habsburgs  in  Transylvania  in  1604-05  were  bright  spots  in 
the  otherwise  dismal  military  history  of  the  Hungarians  during  the 
period  of  Ottoman  occupation  (see  Partition  of  Hungary,  ch.  1). 

The  failed  Turkish  attack  on  Vienna  in  1683  began  a  process 
of  retreat  that  led  to  the  Ottomans'  being  driven  out  of  Buda  in 
1686  and  most  of  Hungary  by  the  end  of  the  century.  The  subse- 
quent Habsburg  rule,  however,  proved  to  be  just  as  cruel  as  that 
of  the  Turks,  and  resulted  in  an  eight-year  rebellion  led  by  Ferenc 
Rakoczi  (see  Hungary  under  the  Habsburgs,  ch.  1).  The  Treaty 
of  Szatmar  (1711)  ended  this  war,  during  which  half  a  million  Hun- 
garians died. 

During  the  eighteenth  century,  the  Habsburg  Hofkriegsrat  (see 
Glossary)  in  Vienna  directly  controlled  the  Hungarian  army,  which 
was  created  in  1715.  The  Palatine  (see  Glossary)  was  commander 
in  chief  of  the  armed  forces  in  Hungary,  but  the  Habsburgs  deliber- 
ately left  the  office  vacant.  Responsibility  for  recruitment  and  supply 
was  assumed  by  the  Hungarian  Viceregal  Council,  located  in 
Pozsony,  the  capital  of  Royal  Hungary  (present-day  Bratislava  in 
Czechoslovakia),  until  1785  and  then  transferred  to  Buda. 

During  the  first  half  of  the  eighteenth  century,  the  Habsburgs 
established  a  Hungarian  standing  army  made  up  of  six  high  com- 
mands: one  for  Hungary  proper  and  the  others  for  Croatia,  Slavo- 
nia,  Transylvania,  the  Banat  (in  southern  Hungary),  and  the 
Military  Frontier  Zones  (located  in  Croatia).  The  Hungarian  stand- 
ing army  was  supported  by  war  taxes  paid  by  the  counties  and 
towns.  Soldiers  were  supposed  to  serve  for  life  but  were  usually 
discharged  after  twenty  years  of  service.  This  term  was  reduced 
to  ten  years  in  1830.  Until  1840  soldiers  were  forced  into  service 
by  press  gangs;  later  they  were  selected  by  lot. 

In  1790  the  Hungarian  nobility  revolted  against  the  Habsburgs 
in  an  attempt  to  restore  former  feudal  privileges  and  Hungarian 
autonomy.  A  separate  Hungarian  army  was  formed  from  the 
banderia,  but  it  was  dissolved  when  the  Habsburgs  managed  to  avoid 
war  with  Prussia  and  thus  were  able  to  redirect  their  imperial  forces 
toward  Hungary. 

Hungarian  soldiers  fought  in  the  Habsburg  army  during  the  wars 
against  France  from  1792  to  1815.  Except  for  a  small  battle  at  Gyor 
in  1808 — which  the  French  won — no  military  action  took  place  on 
Hungarian  soil.  Nevertheless,  the  Hungarian  troops  suffered  more 
than  150,000  casualties  during  these  wars. 

The  revolution  that  broke  out  in  Vienna  in  1848 — part  of  a  wave 
of  revolts  that  swept  across  Europe  that  year — caused  enough  dis- 
ruption in  the  imperial  government  to  allow  the  Hungarian  nobil- 
ity to  seize  more  political  autonomy  for  Hungary.  After  quelling 


227 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

the  revolt  in  other  parts  of  the  empire,  the  Habsburg  government 
in  September  1848  sent  forces  into  Hungary  under  Josip  Jelacic, 
the  Habsburg  governor  of  Croatia.  Jelacic 's  army  was  met  by  a 
hastily  formed  Hungarian  army  and  was  driven  out  of  the  coun- 
try. The  government  in  Vienna  attacked  again  in  the  late  fall  and 
even  occupied  Pest  in  early  December.  In  the  spring,  however, 
these  Habsburg  forces  were  driven  out  by  a  Hungarian  army  under 
a  young  major,  Artur  Gorgei,  while  another  Hungarian  army, 
under  General  Jozef  Bern,  drove  the  Habsburg  forces  out  of  Tran- 
sylvania. Nevertheless,  in  June  1849  the  Russian  army  came  to 
the  rescue  of  the  Habsburgs  and  invaded  Hungary  through  the 
Carpathian  Mountains.  Outnumbered  and  outgunned,  Bern's  small 
army  was  defeated  in  August,  and  Gorgei  surrendered  his  forces 
to  the  Russians  shortly  afterward.  The  revolt  was  crushed  and  its 
leaders  hanged,  although  Lajos  Kossuth,  the  leader  of  the  revolu- 
tionary government,  escaped  to  the  Ottoman  Empire. 

Although  the  Compromise  of  1867  establishing  the  Dual  Monar- 
chy of  Austria-Hungary  gave  each  country  separate  parliaments 
and  separate  governments,  the  Hungarian  military  forces  remained 
under  centralized  Habsburg  control  (see  Dual  Monarchy,  ch.  1). 
Thus,  Hungarian  soldiers,  together  with  the  other  troops  of  na- 
tions under  the  Habsburg  monarchy,  found  themselves  mobiliz- 
ing for  war  in  the  summer  of  1914,  first  against  Serbia  and  then 
against  Serbia's  ally,  Russia.  The  largest  Hungarian  army  in  his- 
tory fought  under  the  imperial  flag  on  the  side  of  the  Central 
Powers. 

The  Military  in  Trianon  Hungary 

Hungarian  independence  came  in  1918,  when  the  Habsburg  Em- 
pire's disintegration  gave  not  only  the  Hungarians  but  also  the  em- 
pire's other  nationalities  the  opportunity  to  establish  sovereign 
states.  Hungarian  soldiers,  scattered  among  the  Habsburg  troops 
at  various  places  within  and  outside  the  empire,  were  ordered  home 
by  the  government  of  Mihaly  Karolyi  in  the  fall  of  1918.  They  found 
their  country  racked  by  political  and  economic  strife.  Hungary  could 
not  resist  the  Romanian  army's  advance  to  Budapest  but  did  drive 
the  Czechs  out  of  northern  Hungary  (present-day  Slovakia). 
However,  the  Treaty  of  Trianon  signed  in  June  1920  pushed  the 
Hungarian  army  back  close  to  the  present-day  boundaries  (see 
Trianon  Hungary,  ch.  1).  Moreover,  the  Treaty  of  Trianon  limited 
Hungary's  military  forces  to  35,000  soldiers. 

Motivated  by  a  desire  to  regain  lands  lost  as  a  result  of  the  Treaty 
of  Trianon,  Hungary  allied  itself  with  Italy  in  the  late  1920s  and 
with  Germany  during  the  1930s.  Diplomacy  and  alliances,  rather

than  military  action,  brought  about  the  return  of  some  former  Hun- 
garian lands  in  1938-39.  Hungary  participated  in  the  German  in- 
vasion of  the  Soviet  Union  in  June  1941  by  committing  a  small 
force  to  aid  in  the  German  occupation  of  the  Ukraine.  After  Janu- 
ary 1942,  however,  the  Hungarian  army  was  thrown  into  the  front 
lines  with  the  Germans.  Underequipped  (one  machine  gun  was 
allotted  for  every  kilometer  of  front  line)  and  lacking  warm  cloth- 
ing and  fuel,  this  army  suffered  about  200,000  casualties  at  the 
battle  of  Stalingrad  during  the  winter  of  1942-43.  This  defeat,  com- 
bined with  the  Soviet  rollback  of  the  German  invasion,  quickly 
turned  Hungarian  public  opinion  against  the  war.  Many  Hungarian 
prisoners  of  war  fought  on  the  side  of  their  Soviet  captors  or  were 
sent  as  partisans  behind  the  Axis  lines  in  southeastern  Europe.  Tired 
of  the  half-hearted  Hungarian  war  effort,  the  Germans  occupied 
Hungary  in  March  1943.  Admiral  Miklos  Horthy,  the  Hungar- 
ian regent,  attempted  to  negotiate  an  armistice  with  the  Allies  in 
the  fall  of  1944.  Horthy  was  soon  arrested  by  the  Germans,  but 
by  then  the  Red  Army  had  already  entered  eastern  Hungary.  The 
Red  Army  captured  Budapest  in  December  and  pushed  the  Ger- 
mans completely  out  of  Hungary  by  early  April  1945. 

Sovietization 

By  the  end  of  World  War  II,  the  public  had  little  respect  for  the 
army  because  the  war  had  been  lost  and  the  territory  that  had  been 


229 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

reincorporated  after  1938  was  given  back  to  Czechoslovakia,  Roma- 
nia, and  Yugoslavia.  Soviet  officers  believed  Hungarian  army 
officers  to  be  as  guilty  as  their  German  counterparts  and,  because 
of  the  undistinguished  performance  of  the  Hungarian  army  dur- 
ing the  war,  the  Soviets  had  no  respect  for  Hungary  as  a  military 
force.  The  communists  distrusted  the  former  army  officers,  and 
these  officers  hated  the  communists.  After  the  Hungarian  People's 
Republic  was  established  in  1949,  many  of  these  officers  were 
punished  and  often  sent  to  the  harshest  labor  camps  (see  Postwar 
Hungary,  ch.  1). 

The  postwar  Hungarian  army  developed  out  of  divisions  put 
together  to  fight  Germany  after  Hungary  had  made  peace  with  the 
Allies  in  December  1944.  Under  Soviet  pressure,  however,  the  army 
was  quickly  demobilized  in  1946,  and  most  officers  were  removed 
because  of  pro-Western  or  anticommunist  sympathies.  A  new  force 
was  then  created  under  an  independent  command  controlled  by 
the  Hungarian  Communist  Party,  and  a  new  army — the  Hungar- 
ian People's  Army — officially  emerged  in  1948.  The  military  clause 
of  the  peace  treaty  that  Hungary  signed  with  the  Allies  permitted 
it  to  have  an  army  of  65,000  troops  and  an  air  force  of  5,000  per- 
sonnel and  ninety  aircraft. 

According  to  American  expert  Ivan  Volgyes,  Mihaly  Farkas, 
the  minister  of  defense  from  1948  to  1953,  served  as  the  chief  ar- 
chitect of  the  new  Hungarian  People's  Army.  Following  Soviet 
orders,  Farkas,  himself  an  avowed  Stalinist,  set  out  to  imitate  the 
Soviet  army  and  to  Sovietize  the  Hungarian  army.  The  HPA's 
organization  mirrored  that  of  the  Soviet  army.  Its  uniforms,  ranks 
and  insignia,  decorations,  and  "general  privileges"  were  all  based 
on  the  Soviet  model,  as  was  the  "dual  command  system,"  whereby 
the  party  attached  political  commissars  to  each  military  commander 
to  ensure  the  political  reliability  and  ideological  commitment  of 
the  troops.  These  political  officers  were  assigned  by  the  Ministry 
of  Defense's  Main  Political  Administration  (see  Glossary)  and  were 
given  instructions  by  the  Administrative  Department  of  the 
Secretariat  of  the  Hungarian  Workers'  Party  (HWP — on  Novem- 
ber 1,  1956,  renamed  the  Hungarian  Socialist  Workers'  Party — 
HSWP).  Although  this  dual  command  system  was  still  in  effect 
in  the  late  1980s,  it  placed  the  most  restrictions  on  military  com- 
manders in  the  period  between  1949  and  1955. 

Soviet  influence  further  increased  when,  starting  in  November 
1948,  hundreds  of  Soviet  military  "advisers"  were  assigned  to  the 
Hungarian  army  at  all  command  levels  down  to  the  regimental 
one.  Although  theoretically  acting  only  as  advisers,  they  influenced 
all  important  decisions.  Beginning  in  December  1948,  thousands

of  Hungarians  began  attending  Soviet  military  and  political  acade- 
mies to  gain  technical  expertise  and  political  indoctrination.  Hun- 
garian generals  were  sent  to  Soviet  general  staff  schools  (see  Soviet 
Influence,  this  ch.). 

The  regime  managed  to  create  a  communist  officer  corps  by  ac- 
tively recruiting  workers  and  peasants  into  the  higher  ranks  of  the 
military.  By  1954  a  little  more  than  half  of  the  officers  were  chil- 
dren of  manual  laborers,  while  about  one- third  came  from  peasant 
families.  The  officer  corps  provided  upward  mobility  for  the  former 
"underclass,"  while  providing  material  benefits  in  a  country  where 
standards  of  living  were  low  compared  with  those  of  Western 
Europe. 

State  Security  Forces  and  the  Revolution 

Ironically,  by  the  time  the  HPA  had  become  thoroughly  Sovi- 
etized,  the  first  waves  of  de-Stalinization  rippled  through  the  Hun- 
garian Workers'  Party.  In  1953  the  Stalinist  party  leader,  Matyas 
Rakosi,  lost  his  position  as  prime  minister,  and  the  Stalinist  minister 
of  defense,  Mihaly  Farkas,  fell  from  power.  Professional  training 
for  officers  was  instituted  at  the  military  academies.  A  better  edu- 
cated and  increasingly  professional  officer  corps  began  to  question 


231 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

the  dogmatic  teachings  of  the  party.  Tension  arose  when  the  "in- 
ternationalism" (a  euphemism  for  following  the  Soviet  line  in  for- 
eign and  military  policy)  stressed  by  the  communist  state  clashed 
with  the  latent  nationalism  of  the  officers.  These  officers  also  re- 
sented special  privileges  bestowed  on  both  the  State  Security  Depart- 
ment (Allamvedelmi  Osztaly — AVO — the  name  for  the  pre- 1956 
secret  police)  and  the  Soviet  officers  in  the  country. 

Although  the  HPA  did  not  participate  in  the  Revolution  of  1956 
as  an  organized  force,  its  role  in  that  conflict  demonstrated  its  po- 
litical unreliability  to  both  the  regime  and  the  Soviet  Union  (see 
Revolution  of  1956,  ch.  1).  Organized  military  support  for  the  revo- 
lution did  not  occur  for  two  reasons.  First,  before  being  sent  home 
on  October  28-29,  the  Soviet  military  advisers  in  Hungary  ordered 
various  sections  of  the  Hungarian  army  to  disperse.  Second,  Prime 
Minister  Imre  Nagy  refused  to  order  the  HPA  to  oppose  the  final 
Soviet  invasion  that  took  place  on  November  3.  However,  not  only 
did  conscripts  refuse  to  fire  on  mass  demonstrations  that  took  place 
on  October  23  (although  the  AVO  forces  did),  but  some  even  went 
over  to  the  insurgents  and  supplied  them  with  weapons.  Suppos- 
edly "politically  reliable"  cadets  from  military  academies  likewise 
joined  the  insurgents,  as  did  some  military  officers.  One  of  the  most 
important  military  figures  to  join  the  revolutionaries  was  Colonel 
Pal  Maleter,  the  commander  of  an  armored  unit  sent  to  recapture 
the  Kilian  barracks  in  Budapest  from  the  Freedom  Fighters.  In 
a  parley  with  the  insurgents,  Maleter  became  convinced  that  they 
"were  loyal  sons  of  the  Hungarian  people,"  and  he  joined  them. 
Maleter  eventually  became  minister  of  defense  in  the  Nagy  govern- 
ment; he  was  later  tried  and  executed  with  Nagy  in  1958. 

The  regular  police,  at  least  those  in  Budapest,  were  likewise  sym- 
pathetic to  the  insurgents.  On  October  24,  Sandor  Kopacsi,  chief 
of  the  Budapest  police,  gave  orders  to  supply  the  revolutionaries 
with  weapons.  Budapest  police  joined  the  rebels  but  did  not  fight 
the  Soviet  army.  Police  headquarters  then  became  headquarters 
for  revolutionary  forces. 

Many  members  of  the  dreaded  AVO,  by  contrast,  fell  victim 
to  the  public's  wrath.  During  the  revolution,  AVO  recruits  deserted, 
and  its  professional  officers  found  themselves  hunted  down  by  mobs. 
Some  lynchings  occurred.  The  regular  police  helped  disarm  the 
security  police,  and  those  security  police  known  to  have  commit- 
ted acts  of  state  terror  against  the  citizenry  were  taken  into  cus- 
tody to  await  trial  (some  were  summarily  executed).  Most  AVO 
officers  were  detained  by  the  revolutionary  government,  which 
abolished  the  security  police  on  October  29.  At  first,  Moscow  sought 
to  suppress  the  insurgency  with  the  forces  at  hand.  Soviet  armored 


232 


National  Security 


units  began  arriving  in  Budapest  in  the  early  morning  of  October 
24.  For  the  next  four  days,  they  fought  intermittently  with  the  in- 
surgents. They  were  unable  to  dislodge  Hungarian  army  units  in 
the  Kilian  barracks  that  were  under  the  leadership  of  Colonel 
Maleter  or  the  units  near  the  Corvin  Cinema.  Soviet  forces  and 
advisers  publicly  withdrew  from  Budapest  on  October  28.  On  the 
surface,  it  seemed  as  through  the  revolt  was  victorious. 

On  October  30,  the  government  formed  the  Revolutionary  Com- 
mittee of  the  Armed  Forces,  with  representatives  from  the  army, 
police,  and  the  Freedom  Fighters.  The  following  day,  the  appoint- 
ment as  its  head  of  General  Bela  K.  Kiraly,  who  had  been  impris- 
oned from  1951  to  1956,  was  announced.  On  November  1,  1956, 
Hungary  withdrew  from  the  Warsaw  Pact  and  declared  political 
neutrality.  This  act  was  in  response  to  reports  of  the  Soviet  army's 
entering  the  country  in  force  on  October  31. 

The  Soviet  army  began  pouring  into  Hungary  on  November  1 
and  proceeded  to  occupy  airfields  and  other  strategic  points  in  the 
country.  The  invasion  used  120,000  soldiers  taken  from  eleven  fully 
staffed,  "category-one"  (forces  of  three-quarters'  to  full  strength) 
divisions  in  Romania  and  the  Ukraine.  Volgyes  believes  that  the 
coordinated  nature  of  the  attack  and  the  positions  taken  by  Soviet 
units  suggest  that  the  Soviet  Union  had  planned  the  invasion  far 
in  advance. 

The  Soviet  army  returned  to  Budapest  in  force  on  November  4. 
The  HP  A,  still  splintered  and  riddled  with  pro- Soviet  officers,  could 
not  offer  organized  resistance.  The  Freedom  Fighters  had  neither 
the  manpower  nor  the  ammunition  to  oppose  the  Soviet  army  for 
long.  After  the  fighting  stopped,  the  Soviet  authorities  began  to 
round  up  suspects,  disarm  the  Hungarian  People's  Army,  and  carry 
out  summary  executions.  In  the  next  few  years,  the  Hungarian 
courts  handed  down  an  estimated  2,000  death  sentences,  primar- 
ily to  street  fighters. 

The  Postrevolutionary  Period 

The  HPA  underwent  a  purge  after  the  revolution.  Officers  were 
required  to  sign  a  declaration  condemning  the  revolution,  prais- 
ing Hungarian- Soviet  "friendship,"  and  pledging  allegiance  to  the 
new  government  of  Janos  Kadar.  Nearly  20  percent  of  the  officer 
corps  refused  to  sign  the  declaration,  even  under  threats,  and  were 
expelled  from  the  army.  In  the  year  following  the  revolution,  the 
army  was  reorganized  under  Soviet  supervision,  with  increased 
power  given  to  the  political  commanders.  However,  in  order  to 
assuage  public  opinion,  the  official  mission  of  the  army  changed 
from  "defending  socialism"  to  defending  Hungary. 


233 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

The  HPA  became  an  integral  part  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  forces 
in  1957  but  did  not  participate  in  pact  military  exercises  until  1962. 
The  HPA  participated,  although  reluctantly,  in  the  Soviet-led 
Warsaw  Pact  invasion  of  Czechoslovakia  in  August  1968.  In  1989 
the  Hungarian  government  revealed  that  the  HPA  participated  in 
the  invasion  because  the  Kadar  regime  feared  that  failure  to  do 
so  would  have  halted  Soviet  exports  of  raw  materials  to  Hungary. 

Through  the  late  1980s,  the  HPA  and  Soviet  troops  held  joint 
exercises  on  Hungarian  soil  twice  a  year,  and  Hungarian  forces 
participated  in  exercises  held  on  the  territory  of  other  Warsaw  Pact 
countries.  Rarely,  however,  did  forces  from  the  other  Warsaw  Pact 
nations  conduct  military  exercises  in  Hungary. 

Government  and  Party  Control 

Ultimate  responsibility  for  defense  policy  lay  with  the  HSWP 
Politburo  (see  Party  Structure,  ch.  4).  The  party  exercised  several 
channels  of  control  over  the  armed  forces.  The  party  officially  con- 
trolled the  army  through  the  Government  Administration  and 
Administration  Department  of  the  Secretariat.  The  head  of  the 
Ministry  of  Defense's  Main  Political  Administration  reported  to 
this  party  body  and  to  the  minister  of  defense.  The  Main  Political 
Administration,  in  turn,  controlled  the  political  departments  at  the 
division  level  and  the  political  deputies  of  the  commanding  officers 
at  the  subdivision  level.  Party  cells  were  subordinated  to  the  deputy 
commanders  for  political  affairs.  The  Army  Committee  of  the  Cen- 
tral Committee  of  the  HSWP  supervised  overall  political  work  in 
the  army. 

During  peacetime  the  Presidential  Council,  whose  members  were 
subject  to  the  HSWP's  nomenklatura  (see  Glossary)  authority,  over- 
saw national  defense;  the  defense  committee  of  the  National 
Assembly  also  worked  closely  with  the  Presidential  Council  (see 
State  Apparatus,  ch.  4).  At  the  government  level,  the  Council  of 
Ministers'  Committee  of  Defense  supervised  the  defense  commit- 
tees of  Budapest  and  those  of  the  counties.  The  minister  of  defense 
was  a  member  of  the  defense  committees  of  both  the  Council  of 
Ministers  and  the  National  Assembly  in  peacetime.  During  war- 
time, the  president  would  transform  the  Presidential  Council  into 
the  National  Defense  Council,  with  the  minister  of  defense  lead- 
ing the  war  effort. 

In  theory  the  Presidential  Council  appointed  and  dismissed 
officers,  but  in  fact  this  responsibility  was  assumed  by  the  minister 
of  defense.  The  minister  of  defense  had  always  been  a  member  of 
the  Central  Committee  of  the  HSWP,  the  highest  ranking  officer, 
and  the  commander  in  chief  of  the  armed  forces.  He  reported  to 


234 


National  Security 


the  chairman  of  the  Council  of  Ministers  and  to  the  HSWP  Polit- 
buro in  peacetime.  In  late  1989,  Hungary's  minister  of  defense 
was  Colonel  General  Ferenc  Karpati,  who  was  appointed  in  De- 
cember 1985  upon  the  death  of  his  predecessor,  Colonel  General 
Istvan  Olah.  Karpati  had  joined  the  Hungarian  Communist  Party 
in  1945  at  age  nineteen.  His  chief  of  staff  was  Lieutenant  General 
Jozsef  Pacsek.  At  the  same  time,  Brigadier  General  Istvan  Bracsok 
served  as  secretary  of  the  HSWP's  People's  Army  Committee,  while 
Lajos  Krasznai  served  as  chief  of  the  HPA's  Main  Political  Ad- 
ministration. 

Party  membership  was  essential  for  career  advancement  in  the 
military;  hence,  party  membership  among  officers  was  high;  ac- 
cording to  Karpati  it  was  80  percent  in  1989.  This  high  level  of 
party  membership  among  officers  was  another  means  of  party  con- 
trol over  the  military.  The  party  began  recruiting  prospective 
officers  in  the  military  academies,  where  students  underwent  a 
screening  process  to  assess  their  political  reliability. 

By  contrast,  party  membership  among  enlisted  men  and  non- 
commissioned officers  (NCOs)  was  relatively  low.  Estimates  placed 
party  membership  at  0.5  to  0.8  percent  of  those  persons  drafted, 
compared  with  about  4  percent  for  the  general  population  of  the 
same  age.  In  the  late  1980s,  however,  party  membership  was  seri- 
ously declining,  and  it  can  safely  be  assumed  that  the  percentage 
of  HSWP  members  among  the  military  rank  and  file  was  drop- 
ping as  well. 

Expenditures 

The  military  budget  underwent  a  series  of  reductions  in  the  late 
1980s  because  of  the  country's  worsening  economic  problems.  The 

1987  estimated  military  budget,  based  on  Ministry  of  Finance  in- 
formation, was  US$867  million  (40.745  billion  forints).  The  1989 
budget  was  cut  to  US$576  million  (40.3  billion  forints)  even  be- 
fore January  1,  1989.  The  proportion  of  the  military  budget  devoted 
to  the  acquisition  of  new  technology  dropped  from  32  percent  in 

1988  to  16  percent  in  1989.  From  1980  to  1985,  this  proportion 
had  averaged  about  50  percent  of  the  military  budget. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  Soviet  Union  and  other  Warsaw  Pact  coun- 
tries expressed  displeasure  with  the  relatively  low  Hungarian  defense 
budget,  but  this  pressure  did  not  induce  the  Hungarians  to  increase 
the  percentage  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glossary) 
devoted  to  defense.  Only  Romania  spent  a  smaller  percentage  of 
GDP  on  national  defense  than  Hungary,  but  in  absolute  numbers 
Hungary's  outlay  was  the  smallest  in  the  Warsaw  Pact. 


235 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

By  contrast,  the  funds  spent  by  the  government  for  armed  forces 
subject  to  the  Ministry  of  Interior  and  the  Workers'  Guard  increased 
by  nearly  22  percent  from  1987  to  1988  and  by  nearly  24  percent 
from  1988  to  1989.  Much  of  this  increase,  however,  was  expected 
to  be  canceled  out  by  inflation  and  price  reform. 

The  budget  for  the  defense  and  interior  ministries  had  to  be  ap- 
proved by  the  defense  committee  of  the  National  Assembly,  a  body 
that  managed  to  increase  its  power  during  the  late  1980s.  Neverthe- 
less, in  1989  the  committee  once  again  approved  the  state  budgets 
for  the  ministries  of  defense  and  interior  and,  for  the  first  time, 
the  Workers'  Guard,  without  inquiring  about  how  the  money  was 
to  be  spent. 

Military  Industry 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  government's  defense  industry  produced 
only  a  small  amount  of  the  HPA's  needs.  Major  weapons  were 
obtained  from  the  Soviet  Union.  Communications  and  instrumen- 
tation equipment  made  up  about  three-quarters  of  the  country's 
military  production,  while  artillery  and  infantry  weapons  and  am- 
munition made  up  another  12  percent.  The  production  of  vehicles 
and  aviation  components  contributed  about  8  percent,  while  chem- 
icals and  light  industrial  products  formed  the  remaining  5  percent. 

In  early  1989,  military  industries  anticipated  a  31 -percent  decline 
in  production  compared  with  the  previous  year  because  of  the 
slashed  military  budget  and  a  drop  in  exports.  Factories  that 
produced  mostly  military  equipment  were  expected  to  be  hard  hit. 
Military  orders,  mostly  long-range  microwave  equipment  and 
accessories,  made  up  about  80  percent  of  the  production  of  the  Pre- 
cision Mechanics  Enterprise.  Military  orders  for  handguns  made 
up  35  percent  of  the  Weapon  and  Gas  Appliance  Factory's  produc- 
tion and  25  percent  of  the  orders  for  the  Diosgyor  Engineering  Fac- 
tory. The  Machine  Factory  at  Godollo,  which  produced  components 
for  military  vehicles  and  tanks  and  repaired  army  equipment,  was 
owned  by  the  Ministry  of  Defense  and  operated  by  soldiers.  In  Janu- 
ary 1989,  it  was  operating  at  50  percent  of  capacity  because  orders 
from  the  other  Warsaw  Pact  countries  dropped  by  50  percent  and 
a  cut  in  sales  to  the  HP  A  was  anticipated.  The  military  produc- 
tion of  the  Videoton  telecommunications  factory,  valued  at  US$132 
million  in  1988,  was  expected  to  fall  to  US$84.9  million  in  1991, 
and  more  than  2,000  of  its  7,000  workers  were  expected  to  be 
released,  resulting  in  a  40-percent  idle  manufacturing  capacity.  The 
effects  of  cutbacks  in  military  procurement  on  the  euphemistically 
named  "Lamp  Factory"  (Lampagyar),  which  produced  pistols  and 


236 


National  Security 


automatic  rifles,  and  the  Danuvia  Factory,  which  manufactured 
machine  guns,  was  not  known. 

Soviet  Influence 

In  the  late  1980s,  Soviet  influence  on  Hungary's  HPA  was  ex- 
ercised in  two  ways.  Numerous  organizational  ties  linked  the  Soviet 
military  with  Hungary's  armed  forces.  An  equally  important  in- 
fluence was  the  fact  that  a  major  component  of  the  Warsaw  Pact's 
military  forces — the  Southern  Group  of  Forces — was  stationed  in 
Hungary. 

Loyalties  and  Control 

Soviet  leader  Nikita  S.  Khrushchev  (1953-64)  once  said  that  the 
Soviet  government  had  never  trusted  the  Hungarian  army.  Despite 
the  training  that  Hungarian  officers  had  received  from  the  Soviet 
military  since  1948  and  the  Soviet  infiltration  of  the  HPA's  top 
command  structure,  the  Revolution  of  1956  confirmed  Moscow's 
apprehensions.  The  events  of  1956  threw  the  loyalty  of  even  the 
top  Hungarian  military  elite  into  question. 

In  the  1980s,  Soviet  influence  on  Hungarian  military  officers 
was  much  greater  among  the  upper-level  officers  than  among  lower- 
level  officers,  regimental  sergeants  major,  or  NCOs  (see  Uniforms 
and  Rank  Insignia,  this  ch.).  The  higher-ranking  officers  saw  their 
careers  tied  to  Hungary's  association  with  the  Soviet  Union  and 
the  Warsaw  Pact,  while  those  of  lesser  ranks  saw  Soviet  troops  in 
Hungary  as  an  army  of  occupation. 

The  Soviet  Union  exerted  its  military  influence  within  Hungary 
in  a  variety  of  ways.  The  obvious  means  were  official  ministry-to- 
ministry  contacts  and  the  presence  of  Soviet  troops  in  the  coun- 
try. In  addition,  the  chief  Soviet  representative  of  the  Warsaw 
Treaty  Organization  in  Hungary  exercised  day-to-day  control  of 
both  the  Soviet  army  and  the  Hungarian  People's  Army.  Also,  the 
Soviet  military  attache  and  staff  in  the  Soviet  embassy  maintained 
a  liaison  office  with  the  HSWP  Central  Committee's  Government 
Administration  and  Administration  Department,  the  Ministry  of 
National  Defense's  Main  Political  Administration,  and  the  Cen- 
tral Committee  of  the  HPA's  party  organization.  And,  finally,  the 
representative  and  staff  of  Soviet  military  intelligence  met  frequently 
with  various  military  and  political  authorities. 

Nevertheless,  the  HPA  was  hardly  a  pawn  of  the  Soviet  mili- 
tary establishment.  During  the  1980-81  crisis  in  Poland,  the  Hun- 
garian military  leadership  received  instructions  from  the  HSWP 
not  to  intervene  in  Poland  without  orders  from  the  party.  This  order 
emanated  not  only  from  a  purportedly  sovereign  government's 


237 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


desire  to  retain  control  over  its  own  military  but  also  from  a  deter- 
mination to  maintain  civilian  control  over  the  military. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  HPA  also  pressed  for  ''more  democracy" 
in  Warsaw  Pact  decision  making.  This  term  justified  requests  for 
giving  Hungary  and  other  non- Soviet  members  a  greater  voice  in 
decision  making  within  the  pact  and  for  rotating  the  command  of 
the  Warsaw  Pact  forces  among  all  the  military  leaders  of  the  non- 
Soviet  Warsaw  Pact  (NSWP)  countries. 

Soviet  Southern  Group  of  Forces  in  Hungary 

Soviet  troops  have  been  stationed  in  Hungary  since  April  1945, 
when  they  pushed  the  German  army  completely  out  of  the  coun- 
try. After  Hungary  signed  a  peace  treaty  with  the  Allies  in  1947, 
Soviet  forces  remained  in  order  to  secure  lines  of  communication 
with  Soviet  troops  occupying  Austria.  Soviet  forces  withdrew  from 
Austria  in  May  1955  but  remained  in  Hungary  at  the  request  of 
the  High  Command  of  the  Warsaw  Treaty  Organization,  which 
was  formed  one  day  before  the  Austrian  treaty  was  signed. 

In  May  1957,  the  Soviet-installed  government  under  Kadar 
signed  an  agreement  with  the  Soviet  Union  to  legally  recognize 
the  Soviet  forces  that  had  occupied  the  country  in  1956  (see  Revo- 
lution of  1956,  ch.  1).  Called  the  Decree  Having  the  Force  of  Law 
No.  54  of  1957,  it  justified  the  Soviet  presence  as  a  defense  against 
NATO  "aggression"  and  West  German  rearmament.  The  agree- 
ment mentioned  no  specifics,  such  as  the  number  of  Soviet  troops, 
their  deployment  within  Hungary,  and  the  facilities  made  avail- 
able to  them,  although  such  items  may  have  been  written  down 
in  a  secret  protocol.  The  version  of  the  agreement  made  public  men- 
tioned only  that  the  Soviet  troops  were  to  be  stationed  "indefinitely" 
and  that  the  compact  could  be  changed  only  by  mutual  consent. 

Officially  called  the  Southern  Group  of  Forces  (SGF),  Soviet 
troops  in  Hungary  numbered  65,000,  according  to  NATO  esti- 
mates made  in  November  1988.  At  that  time,  the  troops  were  under 
the  command  of  Lieutenant  General  Aleksei  A.  Demidov.  The 
Soviet  forces  in  Hungary  corresponded  strategically  to  the  Group 
of  Soviet  Forces  stationed  in  East  Germany,  the  Northern  Group 
of  Forces  in  Poland,  and  the  Central  Group  of  Forces  in  Czecho- 
slovakia. 

The  SGF,  headquartered  in  Budapest,  commanded  the  13th 
Guards  Tank  Division  in  Veszprem,  the  2d  Tank  Division  in 
Esztergom,  the  253d  Motor  Rifle  Division  in  Szekesfehervar,  and 
the  93d  Guards  Motor  Rifle  Division  in  Kecskemet.  These  forces 
were  supported  by  an  air  assault  brigade,  five  fighter  regiments, 
two  fighter- ground  attack  regiments,  several  combat  helicopter 


238

units,  and  reconnaissance  aircraft.  In  a  war  against  NATO,  the 
SGF  and  the  Hungarian  troops  would  be  used  as  part  of  the  South- 
western Theater  of  Military  Operations  (teatr  voennykh  deistvii — 
TVD). 

In  December  1988,  Soviet  leader  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev  an- 
nounced that  the  Soviet  Union  would  unilaterally  remove  some 
of  its  forces  from  Eastern  Europe.  This  force  reduction,  which  began 
in  April  1989,  was  to  be  carried  out  over  a  two-year  period.  It  would 
include  the  tank  division  deployed  at  Veszprem  and  the  surrounding 
area,  an  armored  training  regiment,  a  paratroop  battalion  and  in- 
terceptor squadron  based  at  Tokol  airport  in  Pest  County,  a  chem- 
ical defense  battalion,  and  the  SGF  training  school  for  NCOs  in 
Szolnok.  This  partial  withdrawal  would  remove  450  tanks;  200 
guns,  trench  mortars,  and  mine  throwers;  3,000  vehicles;  and 
10,400  of  the  65,000  Soviet  troops  in  Hungary.  In  April  1989,  Hun- 
garian foreign  minister  Gyula  Horn  said  that  all  Soviet  soldiers 
might  be  removed  from  the  country  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s. 

The  Soviet  troops  were  generally  isolated  from  Hungarian  life. 
They  did  not  interfere  in  Hungarian  affairs  and  appeared  in  pub- 
lic usually  in  small  groups  and  only  in  certain  restricted  areas.  The 
Hungarians  generally  did  not  like  the  Soviet  soldiers  and  did  not 
fraternize  with  them. 

External  Threats  to  National  Security 

In  the  late  1980s,  Hungary's  defense  policy  was  in  a  state  of  flux. 
The  government  no  longer  stressed  the  possibility  of  a  NATO  at- 
tack, nor  did  it  consider  likely  a  Soviet  intervention  to  halt  Hun- 
gary's march  toward  reform.  In  fact,  spokesmen  for  both  Hungary 
and  the  Soviet  Union  publicly  alluded  to  a  possible  withdrawal  of 
Hungary  from  the  Warsaw  Pact  and  the  proclamation  of  neutral- 
ity for  Hungary  such  as  that  enjoyed  by  Finland  and  Austria.  But 
both  sides  spoke  cautiously  about  this  possibility,  and  the  Hun- 
garian government  stressed  that  it  did  not  wish  to  pursue  neutral- 
ity at  the  risk  of  upsetting  the  balance  of  power  in  Europe. 

Threat  from  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization 

Traditionally,  Hungary's  role  in  the  Warsaw  Pact  had  been  to 
follow  the  Soviet  lead  on  matters  of  national  and  bloc  defense.  But 
even  during  the  early  and  middle  1980s,  when  member  countries 
of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO)  began  install- 
ing intermediate-range  ballistic  missiles  in  Western  Europe  in 
response  to  the  installation  of  Soviet  SS-20  missiles  in  the  western 
portion  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  attitude  of  the  Hungarian  govern- 
ment toward  the  West  was  never  as  rabidly  vehement  as  that 


239 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


displayed  by  the  governments  of  Czechoslovakia  or  East  Germany 
(see  Principles  of  Foreign  Policy,  ch.  4).  In  fact,  the  Soviet  Union 
had  criticized  Hungary  for  not  spending  enough  on  its  military 
and  for  stressing  defense  of  the  country  (honvedelem)  instead  of 
defense  of  the  countries  of  the  Warsaw  Pact. 

Western  analysts  speculated  about  Hungary's  military  role  in 
a  Warsaw  Pact  conflict  with  the  West.  Hungary  does  not  border 
any  NATO  country  and  therefore  was  not  in  the  front  line  of 
Warsaw  Pact  troop  deployment.  It  was  seen  to  play  a  supporting 
role,  primarily  by  supplying  military  engineering  support  and  some 
antiaircraft  defense.  In  a  war  with  NATO,  Hungarian  forces  would 
either  be  used  in  the  Warsaw  Pact's  Western  Theater  of  Military 
Operations  against  West  Germany  or  in  the  Southwestern  Thea- 
ter of  Military  Operations  against  NATO's  southern  flank.  In  both 
scenarios,  Hungarian  forces  would  have  to  enter  the  territory  of 
neutral  countries.  For  instance,  Yugoslavia's  neutrality  might  be 
breached  to  project  Soviet  and  Warsaw  Pact  power  in  the  Mediter- 
ranean. Hungarian  military  engineering  support  would  prove  cru- 
cial in  such  a  campaign. 

Threat  from  Romania 

During  the  1980s,  the  Hungarian  government  broke  its  silence 
about  Romania's  oppression  of  its  Hungarian  minority,  number- 
ing about  2  million  to  2.2  million  people  (see  Relations  with  Other 
Communist  Neighbors,  ch.  4).  Under  Soviet  pressure  and  for  the 
sake  of  socialist  solidarity,  the  Hungarian  government  had  refrained 
from  criticizing  Romania,  but  increasing  domestic  pressure  forced 
it  to  act. 

As  the  war  of  words  between  the  two  countries  heated  up,  so 
did  the  potential  for  armed  conflict.  In  July  1989,  Der  Standard,  pub- 
lished in  Vienna,  reported  that  a  secret  meeting  of  the  Hungarian 
state  and  party  leadership  had  taken  place  in  November  1988  in 
which  the  military  was  asked  to  assess  the  strategic  balance  between 
Hungary  and  Romania.  The  resulting  report,  published  in  Febru- 
ary 1989,  revealed  Hungary's  "striking  military  inferiority."  Hun- 
gary had  no  fortifications  on  its  border  with  Romania,  and  in  a 
private  meeting  Romanian  leader  Nicolae  Ceau§escu  allegedly 
warned  Karoly  Grosz,  Hungary's  party  leader,  not  to  install  such 
defenses.  During  the  summer  of  1989,  Hungarian  diplomats  hinted 
at  fear  of  attack  by  Romania.  Der  Spiegel,  published  in  Hamburg, 
reported  in  July  1989  that  Hungary  felt  threatened  by  the  Condor 
intermediate-range  missiles  that  Romania  had  acquired  with  "Ger- 
man and  Argentine  help."  At  a  July  1989  Warsaw  Pact  meeting 
in  Bucharest,  Ceau§escu  was  said  to  have  threatened  Hungary  with 


240 


National  Security 


war,  although  representatives  of  both  countries  agreed  that  steps 
had  to  be  taken  to  stem  the  rising  tension.  Ironically,  by  this  time 
the  Hungarian  opposition  had  stopped  insisting  that  Soviet  troops 
leave  the  country  because  they  were  seen  to  be  the  country's  main 
protection  against  Romania. 

Threat  from  the  Soviet  Union 

From  the  mid- 1940s  through  the  mid-1980s,  the  threat  of  a  Soviet 
invasion  prevented  the  other  Warsaw  Pact  countries  from  deviat- 
ing from  Moscow's  prescribed  domestic  and  foreign  policies.  The 
Soviet  invasion  of  Hungary  in  1956  demonstrated  that  Moscow 
would  act  if  it  believed  that  changes  in  that  country  threatened  the 
security  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  or  the  leading  role  of  the  communist 
party  in  Hungary.  After  economic  reforms  began  in  the  1960s, 
Hungary's  government  and  party  leaders  were  careful  to  take  Soviet 
sensitivities  into  account.  However,  in  the  late  1980s,  Moscow 
showed  that  it  was  sympathetic  rather  than  hostile  to  reforms  within 
Hungary,  thus  lessening  the  chances  of  a  Soviet  invasion. 

The  Hungarian  Armed  Forces 

Compared  with  the  other  countries  in  the  Warsaw  Pact,  in  the 
late  1980s  Hungary  had  the  smallest  army  and  air  force,  as  well 
as  the  fewest  artillery  pieces,  light  armored  vehicles,  and  antiair- 
craft weapons.  It  ranked  last,  along  with  Bulgaria  and  Romania, 
in  the  number  of  military  helicopters,  and  only  Romania  had  fewer 
tanks.  In  addition  to  lagging  behind  its  Warsaw  Pact  allies  quan- 
titatively, the  quality  of  its  military  equipment  was  decidedly  "mid- 
dle level,"  according  to  Volgyes.  As  of  mid- 1988,  the  military  did 
not  possess  modern  Soviet  T-84  tanks,  MiG-29  fighter  aircraft, 
or  the  new  Soviet  5.48mm  infantry  weapons.  Western  analysts  have 
claimed  that  the  Hungarian  military  forces  had  the  lowest  combat 
readiness  in  the  Warsaw  Pact  and  were  one  of  the  non- Soviet 
Warsaw  Pact  military  forces  least  trusted  by  Moscow.  The  HPA's 
military  construction  branch  was  the  only  section  of  the  armed  forces 
held  in  high  regard  by  all  observers. 

Of  approximately  100,000  personnel  on  active  duty  in  the  HPA 
in  1988,  about  64,000  were  conscripts.  During  a  national  emer- 
gency, Hungary  could  mobilize  about  900,000  trained  men. 

Ground  Forces 

In  1989  about  77,000  troops  served  in  the  ground  forces  (com- 
monly referred  to  as  the  army),  and  about  45,000  of  them  were 
conscripts.  As  in  other  Warsaw  Pact  armed  forces,  the  army  was 
by  far  the  largest  service. 


241 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

The  reorganization  of  the  HP  A,  still  under  way  in  1989,  at- 
tempted to  transform  its  overall  structure  from  one  army  and  one 
corps  possessing  one  tank  and  five  motorized  rifle  divisions  into 
three  corps  with  a  combined  total  of  five  tank  brigades  and  ten 
motorized  rifle  brigades.  This  reorganization  set  the  HP  A  apart 
from  the  other  armies  of  the  Warsaw  Pact,  which  were  still  primarily 
divided  into  divisions  and  regiments.  The  leadership  of  the  HP  A 
believed  the  reorganization  would  make  the  armed  forces  more  effi- 
cient by  reducing  the  number  of  commands  by  about  one-third. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  central  headquarters  of  the  HP  A  was 
in  Szekesfehervar,  with  the  three  corps  headquartered  in  Tata, 
Kaposvar,  and  Cegled,  respectively.  Each  corps  consisted  of  five 
brigades  subdivided  into  battalions,  including  an  independent 
artillery  battalion  and  an  engineering  battalion.  The  largest  corps, 
centered  in  Tata,  possessed  three  tank  brigades  and  two  motorized 
rifle  brigades.  The  two  other  corps  each  had  one  tank  brigade  and 
four  motorized  rifle  brigades.  The  corps  stationed  in  Cegled  was 
a  skeleton  unit.  The  three  corps  together  possessed  three  SA-6 
surface-to-air  missile  (SAM)  regiments. 

In  addition  to  the  three  corps  and  fifteen  tank  and  motorized 
rifle  brigades,  the  HPA  possessed  independent  artillery  and  Scud 
surface-to-surface  missile  brigades,  as  well  as  an  airborne  battalion 
(the  thirty- seventh,  stationed  in  Szolnok).  An  antitank  regiment, 
an  antiaircraft  artillery  regiment,  and  an  SA-4  SAM  regiment  were 
still  likewise  army,  and  not  corps,  troops.  Independent  engineer- 
ing battalions  were  used  for  rail  and  roadway  repairs,  construc- 
tion projects,  and  maintenance  and  repair  of  telephone  and  power 
lines. 

In  1988  the  Danube  Flotilla,  incorporated  into  the  army  in  1968, 
consisted  of  700  men  and  eighty- two  vessels,  including  ten  Nestin 
MSI  (riverine)  boats.  During  wartime  its  chief  functions  would  be 
to  clear  the  Danube  and  Tisza  rivers  of  mines  and  to  assist  the  army 
and  its  materiel  in  river  crossings. 

In  1988  the  army  possessed  1,200  T-54  and  T-55  battle  tanks. 
The  Soviet  Union  has  been  producing  these  tanks  since  1945,  but 
some  have  been  built  as  recently  as  1979,  and  many  have  been 
upgraded  with  infrared  night- vision  systems  and  laser  range-finders. 
The  HPA  also  had  about  100  T-72s,  a  model  that  appeared  in 
Soviet  units  in  the  early  1970s  and  began  to  be  seen  in  Warsaw 
Pact  armies  about  1980.  Hungary  also  possessed  about  100  PT-76 
light  tanks. 

The  HPA's  artillery  inventory  in  1988  included  225  M-1938 
(122mm)  and  50  M-1943  or  D-l  (152mm)  howitzers  and  100  D-20 
(152mm)  gun  howitzers.  It  also  included  90  2S1  (122mm)  and 


242 


National  Security 


20  2S3  (152mm)  self-propelled  guns  and  100  M-43  (120mm)  mor- 
tars. The  HPA  had  fifty  BM-21  (122mm)  multiple-rocket  launchers 
and  twenty-four  Frog-7  and  Frog-9  Scud  surface-to-surface  mis- 
sile launchers.  Antitank  defense  consisted  of  100  AT-3  Sagger  (in- 
cluding BRDM-2  self-propelled)  and  100  AT-4  Spigot  antitank 
guided  weapons,  125  SPG-9  (73mm)  recoilless  launchers,  and  100 
D-44  (85mm)  and  50  D-12  (100mm)  antitank  guns.  Air  defense 
weaponry  consisted  of  80  S-60  (57mm)  towed  antiaircraft  guns, 
50  ZSU-4  SP  (23mm)  self-propelled  antiaircraft  guns;  and  30  SA-4, 
60  SA-6,  350  SA-7,  and  50  SA-9  SAMs. 

Reconnaissance  units  in  the  HPA  possessed  an  estimated  300 
BRDM-2  and  400  Hungarian-produced  FUG-65  (OT-65)  scout 
vehicles.  Motorized  infantry  units  were  equipped  with  350  BMP-1 
infantry  combat  vehicles  and  1,000  Hungarian-produced  PSz-H-IV 
(FUG-70)  armored  personnel  carriers.  The  PSz-H-IV  had  been 
in  service  since  1983,  but  production  was  discontinued;  it  was  to 
be  replaced  by  Soviet  BMP- 1  tracked  mechanized  infantry  com- 
bat vehicles. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  HPA  used  as  its  standard  infantry  weapon 
the  Kalashnikov  7.62mm  AKM  assault  rifle  and  its  7.62mm 
AMD-65  version  with  a  folding  stock.  The  7.62mm  RPK  and  RPD 
light  machine  guns  were  also  in  service.  As  of  mid- 1988,  the  armed 
forces  planned  to  convert  to  the  new  standard  Soviet  5.45mm 
weapons,  but  the  actual  conversion  had  not  yet  begun. 

The  HPA  imported  most  of  its  ground  forces  weaponry  from 
the  Soviet  Union.  Domestic  industry  supplied  only  a  small  por- 
tion of  the  army's  needs,  such  as  small-caliber  weapons  (pistols, 
rifles,  and  machine  guns),  some  types  of  artillery  pieces,  and  am- 
munition. 

In  1988  the  HPA's  stock  of  road  transport  vehicles  consisted 
mostly  of  Hungarian-produced  heavy-duty  D-566  trucks,  Soviet 
GAZ-69  and  UAZ-69  trucks,  and  East  German  Robur  LO-1800 
trucks.  Soviet  Ural-355  and  ZIL-131  trucks  had  just  been  in- 
troduced into  service. 

Engineering  equipment  included  PMP  heavy  pontoon  bridges, 
GSP  ferries,  K-61  and  PTS  amphibious  vehicles,  T-54  MTUs, 
MT55s,  and  TMM  truck-mounted  bridging  units  to  build  shorter 
spans.  Hungary  built  bridging  equipment  under  license  from  the 
Soviet  Union,  Czechoslovakia,  and  East  Germany.  Signal  troops 
used  Hungarian-made  and  Soviet-made  equipment. 

The  HPA's  engineering  and  construction  corps  were  considered 
top  notch  among  the  Warsaw  Pact  countries  for  their  excellent  sup- 
port of  amphibious  operations.  Even  Western  analysts  have  called 


243 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

this  contribution  Hungary's  most  important  one  to  Warsaw  Pact 
defense. 

If  engineering  was  the  strongest  component  of  the  HPA,  logis- 
tics was  its  weakest.  Only  the  regular  army  was  trained  in  logistics 
and  provided  with  means  of  transportation.  In  a  war,  the  under- 
equipped  units  would  have  few  logisticians  and  an  insufficient  num- 
ber of  vehicles. 

In  August  1989,  the  Ministry  of  Defense  disbanded  an  armored 
brigade  of  about  2,000  officers  and  enlisted  men  stationed  in 
Szabadszallas  in  Bacs-Kiskun  County  as  part  of  a  planned  9  per- 
cent reduction  of  troops  and  arms  in  the  army  scheduled  for  1989 
and  1990.  Most  of  the  heavy  weaponry  at  the  site  was  scheduled 
to  be  melted  down. 

Air  Force 

In  1989  the  Hungarian  air  force  was  organized  into  one  air 
division  and  one  air  defense  division,  both  headquartered  at 
Veszprem.  The  air  division  consisted  of  three  fighter  or  fighter- 
bomber  regiments  of  three  squadrons  each.  The  air  division  also 
possessed  one  helicopter  regiment  consisting  of  three  squadrons, 
one  transport  regiment  consisting  of  two  squadrons,  and  one  re- 
connaissance squadron.  The  air  defense  division,  responsible  for 
ground-based  air  defense,  consisted  of  three  SAM  regiments.  Air 
force  personnel  in  1988  numbered  approximately  22,000,  of  whom 
8,000  were  conscripts.  The  ratio  of  career  personnel  to  conscripts 
was  slightly  less  than  two  to  one. 

In  1988  the  air  force  possessed  135  combat  aircraft  and  40  at- 
tack helicopters.  The  three  fighter-bomber  squadrons  possessed 
ninety  MiG-21F/PF/bis/U  and  forty-five  MiG-23M  fighter- ground 
attack  aircraft.  The  reconnaissance  squadron  flew  ten  Su-22  air- 
craft. The  two  transport  squadrons  possessed  fifteen  An  24/26s  and 
An-2s.  The  three  helicopter  squadrons  together  had  forty  Mi-24 
attack  helicopters,  twenty-five  Mi-8  medium- transport  helicopters, 
twenty-five  Ka-26  helicopters  for  training  and  civilian  duties,  and 
five  Mi-2  light  transport  helicopters.  Yak-1  Is  and  Yak- 18s,  L-29s, 
and  MiG-15UTIs  were  used  for  training  purposes.  The  air  defense 
system  consisted  of  one  division  with  three  SAM  regiments  pos- 
sessing some  twenty  sites  and  120  SA-2/3  missiles.  In  June  1989, 
Brigadier  General  Istvan  Schmidt,  commander  of  the  Hungarian 
air  force,  announced  that  no  modernization  of  the  air  force  would 
take  place  in  the  near  future,  meaning  that  Hungary  would  con- 
tinue to  rely  heavily  on  the  units  of  the  Soviet  air  force  stationed 
in  the  country.

Manpower 

Article  70  of  the  Constitution  states  that  the  "defense  of  the  coun- 
try shall  be  the  duty  of  every  citizen  of  the  Hungarian  People's 
Republic.  Citizens  shall  perform  military  service  on  the  basis  of 
the  universal  system  of  the  draft."  Therefore,  according  to  the  Na- 
tional Defense  Act  of  1976,  male  citizens  become  eligible  for  mili- 
tary service  after  January  1  of  the  year  in  which  they  turn  eighteen. 
In  1988  about  75,300  males  turned  eighteen,  of  whom  25  percent — 
the  highest  percentage  among  the  Warsaw  Pact  armies — could  be 
expected  to  be  found  unfit  for  military  service  because  of  health 
problems.  More  than  32  percent  of  conscripts  were  twenty-two  years 
old,  showing  that  many  men  were  able  to  defer  their  military  service 
for  educational  or  other  reasons. 

Young  men  were  liable  for  national  service  conscription  until 
age  twenty-three  and  subject  to  call-up  in  times  of  an  emergency 
until  age  fifty-five.  Those  whose  military  service  had  been  inter- 
rupted or  postponed  were  liable  for  conscription  until  age  twenty- 
eight,  although  draft  evaders  were  liable  for  conscription  until  age 
forty.  Women  from  ages  eighteen  to  forty-five  in  medical  profes- 
sions and  women  professionals  within  the  Ministry  of  Interior  were 
automatically  registered  for  military  service  but  could  serve  only 
in  time  of  war  and  then  only  in  noncombatant  functions. 

Before  1980  all  recruits  served  for  two  years  except  those  who 
had  a  completed  their  higher  education;  these  recruits  served  for 
eighteen  months.  In  1980  the  term  of  conscription  was  reduced 
to  eighteen  months  but  remained  at  twenty-four  months  for  those 
conscripted  into  the  air  force.  Recruits  having  children  served  even 
less  time.  In  the  late  1980s,  call-up  occurred  twice  a  year,  in  Febru- 
ary and  in  August. 

Reserves  consisted  of  physically  fit  men  who  were  not  currently 
serving  in  the  armed  forces.  Men  who  had  never  been  drafted  could 
be  called  up  for  six  months  of  reserve  training  until  age  forty. 
Officers  who  had  served  could  be  called  up  every  five  years  for  a 
four-month  period  of  refresher  training,  while  NCOs  and  privates 
could  be  so  trained  for  up  to  three  months  every  five  years.  All 
physically  fit  males  could  be  called  up  at  least  once  a  year  for  maneu- 
vers lasting  no  more  than  twenty  days,  although  legally,  if  neces- 
sary, they  could  serve  for  a  full  year.  Conscripts  could  be  kept  an 
additional  two  months  after  completing  national  service. 

Conscientious  Objection 

According  to  the  National  Defense  Act,  those  persons  who  re- 
fused military  service  during  peacetime  could  receive  up  to  five 
years'  imprisonment.  Permission  was  sometimes  given,  however, 


245 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

to  Jehovah's  Witnesses,  Seventh-Day  Adventists,  or  Nazarenes  to 
serve  as  noncombatants  in  military  construction  units.  Government 
opposition  to  Catholic  conscientious  objectors  increased  after 
October  1986,  when  the  country's  Catholic  bishops  declared  that 
Catholics  could  neither  refuse  nor  condemn  obligatory  military  ser- 
vice, although  they  did  urge  the  state  to  allow  some  sort  of  alter- 
native service.  This  proclamation  was  followed  by  reports  of  dozens 
of  conscientious  objectors'  being  arrested  and  sentenced  to  thirty 
to  thirty-six  months'  imprisonment  by  the  Budapest  Military 
Tribunal.  These  so-called  "expedited"  proceedings  were  charac- 
terized by  trials  lasting  only  ten  to  fifteen  minutes.  One  man  so 
imprisoned,  Karoly  Kiszely,  wrote  a  letter  to  the  Conference  on 
Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  enumerating  the  ways  in  which 
conscientious  objectors  were  harassed:  they  were  physically  abused, 
and  their  punishments  were  imposed  without  court  hearings, 
without  regard  for  judicial  processes,  and  without  legal  counsel. 
Those  convicted  were  allowed  contact  with  only  two  family  mem- 
bers, and  they  were  permitted  to  send  or  receive  only  one  "heav- 
ily censored"  letter  per  month  and  to  receive  only  one  authorized 
visit  by  a  relative  each  month.  Furthermore,  they  were  crowded 
together  in  prison  with  common  criminals. 

The  government  showed  signs  of  softening  its  position  in  late 
1987,  when  it  reduced  the  term  of  military  service  for  future  cler- 
ics from  eighteen  to  twelve  months.  And  in  early  1989,  an  amend- 
ment to  the  National  Defense  Act  permitting  conscientious  objection 
was  introduced  into  the  National  Assembly.  Conscientious  objec- 
tion was  to  be  allowed  beginning  in  the  second  half  of  1989.  On 
March  1,  1989,  the  government  announced  that  seventy  conscien- 
tious objectors  serving  time  in  prison  had  been  released  and  that 
their  criminal  record  would  be  dropped,  pending  approval  of  a  new 
National  Defense  Act.  Noncombatant  service  was  twenty-four 
months  in  the  army  and  another  twelve  months  of  nonarmed  reserve 
service.  Civilian  service  was  initially  proposed  for  thirty-six  months 
at  locations  to  be  determined  by  the  government,  with  labor  paid 
for  in  wages.  In  June  1989,  the  National  Assembly  voted  to  lower 
the  duration  of  civilian  service  to  twenty-eight  months  and  resolved 
that  the  noncombatant  service  and  nonarmed  reserve  service 
together  not  exceed  twenty-eight  months. 

Education  and  Training 

Much  of  the  military  education  system  developed  since  1949  has 
been  patterned  on  Soviet  models,  with  the  help  of  Soviet  advisers. 
This  pattern  was  also  applied  to  troop  training  programs  in  gar- 
risons and  in  the  field.  Yet  despite  Soviet  attempts  to  make  the 


246 


National  Security 


HPA  more  concerned  with  defense  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  countries 
than  with  national  defense,  the  army  remained  highly  patriotic  and 
nationalistic.  Moreover,  toward  the  end  of  the  1980s  attempts  were 
made,  despite  the  HSWP's  objections,  to  partially  depoliticize  the 
military. 

Conscript  Programs 

Call-up  consisted  of  three  steps:  obligatory  premilitary  training 
from  January  1  of  the  year  in  which  the  future  draftee  turned  seven- 
teen; military  registration  at  the  District  Military  Replacement 
Center,  where  the  registree  received  a  medical  examination  and, 
if  disabilities  were  found,  was  obliged  to  correct  those  disabilities 
capable  of  correction  and  continue  premilitary  training;  and  recruit- 
ment, at  which  time  questions  of  medical  fitness  and  service  branch 
and  unit  assignment  were  resolved.  Recruits  underwent  basic  train- 
ing for  four  weeks,  then  took  the  oath  of  allegiance.  This  process 
was  followed  by  six  months  of  specialized  training  for  whatever 
task  the  recruits  were  to  perform.  They  were  then  assigned  to  units. 
During  all  this  time,  the  recruits  also  underwent  ideological  training. 

Through  political  indoctrination,  the  military  aimed  at  incul- 
cating soldiers  with  a  Marxist- Leninist  worldview  that  would  enable 
them  to  accept  party  positions  and  the  way  these  positions  related 
to  internal  and  external  events.  Soldiers  were  taught  the  need  for 
discipline,  self-sacrifice,  and  loyalty  to  party,  country,  and  the  so- 
cialist alliance  (including  the  Soviet  Union),  and  were  inculcated 
with  a  consciousness  of  their  own  invincibility.  In  fact,  the  HPA 
required  that  only  10  percent  of  a  conscript's  training  time  during 
the  first  phase  of  basic  training  be  devoted  to  strictly  political  topics, 
while  70  percent  was  spent  on  military  subjects.  These  relative 
proportions  demonstrated  that  the  HPA  leadership  viewed  politi- 
cal indoctrination  as  secondary  to  teaching  basic  soldiering  to 
recruits  and  persuading  the  brighter  among  them  to  seek  a  profes- 
sional military  career.  Those  who  showed  both  desire  and  ability 
were  given  twenty-eight  hours  of  free  time  each  week  to  prepare 
to  enter  university.  The  HPA  also  awarded  scholarships  to  some 
recruits  to  attend  university  full  time  during  their  service  time,  plus 
another  twenty-four  days  of  additional  annual  leave  and  consider- 
ably increased  pay  and  benefits. 

The  combat  training  for  recruits  resembled  that  of  other  Warsaw 
Pact  countries.  Soldiers  were  taught  proficiency  with  weapons, 
weapon  systems,  battlefield  tactics,  endurance,  and  stress  preven- 
tion. Tactical  exercises  and  maneuvers  were  often  undertaken  with 
Soviet  forces  in  the  country.  Battle  areas  in  such  exercises  could 
be  twenty- six  to  thirty-two  kilometers  deep,  and  nuclear  strikes  were 


247 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


simulated.  Soldiers  sometimes  were  electronically  monitored  for 
stress. 

Housing  provided  to  conscripts  was  of  poor  quality.  In  Decem- 
ber 1988,  Minister  of  Defense  Ferenc  Karpati  admitted  that  10 
percent  of  the  barracks  were  not  fit  for  habitation  because  they  did 
not  have  regular  hot  water  service.  In  general,  most  barracks  were 
sixty  to  eighty  years  old  and  badly  needed  new  wiring  and 
plumbing. 

Material  deprivation  aside,  most  conscripts  considered  their  mili- 
tary training  inadequate.  As  well  as  spending  time  in  political  in- 
doctrination courses,  conscripts  were  obliged  to  perform  a  great 
deal  of  work  in  the  labor-starved  economy  (see  Labor  Force,  ch.  3). 
For  example,  in  1987  soldiers  worked  32,000  man-days  in  agricul- 
ture. Many  conscripts,  even  those  assigned  to  border  guard  duty, 
regarded  military  service  as  a  waste  of  time. 

Specialized- Officer  Programs 

Despite  the  benefits,  youth  in  the  late  1980s  showed  little  interest 
in  professional  military  careers.  According  to  the  Ministry  of 
Defense,  this  lack  of  interest  resulted  in  a  pool  of  applicants  smaller 
than  the  number  needed  for  a  good  selection  of  candidates. 

Candidates  for  officer  training  were  chosen  by  the  ministries  of 
defense,  interior,  and  education,  together  with  the  Communist 
Youth  League's  central  committee  (see  Mass  Organizations,  ch.  2). 
These  candidates  had  to  be  of  "good  character,"  politically  relia- 
ble, physically  fit,  single,  and  not  over  twenty-one  years  of  age, 
and  they  had  to  demonstrate  military  aptitude.  They  were  required 
to  take  mathematics  and  physics  tests  and  psychological  examina- 
tions. Knowledge  of  Russian  was  necessary  to  become  an  officer 
in  the  air  force.  After  such  screening,  candidates  attended  a  mili- 
tary college  for  four  years  as  officer  cadets.  After  passing  final 
examinations,  they  became  junior  officers  (in  the  army,  air  force, 
or  border  guard)  and  were  obligated  to  serve  fifteen  years. 

Political  officers  were  trained  in  military  colleges  but  took  different 
courses.  A  background  in  the  Communist  Youth  League  and  the 
Hungarian  National  Defense  Association  (Magyar  honvedelmi 
szovetseg — MHSz)  helped  in  selection  for  this  career.  Older  can- 
didates were  chosen  from  the  party  apparatus  or  from  those  with 
degrees  in  the  "science  of  Marxism-Leninism."  The  Ministry  of 
Defense's  Main  Political  Administration  oversaw  the  selection  and 
screening  of  political  officers. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  HP  A  operated  schools  ranging  from  secon- 
dary schools  through  colleges  for  the  academic,  technical,  and  po- 
litical training  and  advancement  of  regular  personnel.  Many  senior 


248 


National  Security 


officers,  in  addition  to  successfully  completing  military  schooling 
at  all  levels,  also  were  sent  to  the  Soviet  Union  for  courses  in  that 
country's  military  institutions.  Such  Soviet  schools  included  the 
Voroshilov  General  Staff  Military  Academy  in  Moscow,  the  Frunze 
Military  Academy  and  the  Malinovskii  Military  Academy,  the 
Zhukov  Air  Defense  Academy,  and  the  Moscow  Military  Academy 
of  the  General  Staff.  Courses  of  study  in  the  Soviet  Union  lasted 
from  two  to  eight  years.  The  Soviet  Union  also  sent  lecturers  and 
textbooks  to  Hungary.  Hungarian  officers  also  were  trained  in 
Czechoslovakia  and  Poland. 

The  military  academies  were  the  highest  level  of  military  school- 
ing, the  most  important  of  which  was  the  Miklos  Zrinyi  Military 
Academy  in  Budapest.  Before  1968  its  entrance  requirements  were 
lenient,  but  after  that  time  entry  was  obtained  only  upon  the  suc- 
cessful completion  of  a  military  college  or  an  officers'  training  school 
of  equivalent  ranking.  The  course  of  study  took  three  years,  and 
a  variety  of  subjects  were  offered.  Graduation  from  the  Miklos 
Zrinyi  Military  Academy  was  necessary  to  attain  high-level  com- 
mand positions. 

The  Lajos  Kossuth  Military  Academy  in  Szentendre  in  Pest 
County  also  ranked  high  in  the  military  education  system.  It  was 
considered  to  be  academically  equal  to  other  institutions  of  higher 
learning.  Graduates  were  commissioned  as  army  officers.  The  Lajos 
Kossuth  Military  Academy  offered  specialized  training  in  mecha- 
nized infantry,  armored  troops,  surface-to-surface  artillery,  en- 
gineering, military  economy  and  supply,  and  border  guard  work. 
The  Kossuth  Academy  required  knowledge  of  two  foreign  lan- 
guages, one  of  which  had  to  be  Russian.  The  school  also  offered 
many  courses  on  various  aspects  of  Marxism-Leninism. 

Other  high-level  military  schools  included  the  Mate  Zalka  Tech- 
nical Military  Academy  in  Budapest,  which  specialized  in  antiair- 
craft, artillery,  radar  technology,  signaling  and  telecommunications, 
and  nuclear,  biological,  and  chemical  (NBC)  defense  and  warfare; 
the  Gyorgy  Kilian  Technical  Air  Force  Academy,  which  trained 
ground  and  air  crews  and  taught  aviation  and  aircraft  maintenance; 
the  Honved  Military  College,  which  offered  a  three-year  course 
of  study  for  university  graduates  training  to  become  officers;  and 
the  Frigyes  Karikas  Military  College.  The  HPA  also  operated 
specialized  military  high  schools  in  Eger,  Nyiregyhaza,  and  Tata. 

Volunteers  for  military  colleges  were  generally  between  the  ages 
of  eighteen  and  twenty-one  and  were  drawn  from  all  parts  of  the 
country.  As  a  group,  their  precollege  academic  performance  was 
not  impressive.  Nearly  three-quarters  chose  a  military  career  be- 
cause they  liked  the  military  life-style  and  its  contribution  to  society. 


249 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

The  remainder  had  motives  that  the  HPA  found  less  than  admira- 
ble, such  as  the  desire  for  high  pay  and  fringe  benefits,  and  had 
goals  that  have  been  described  as  "incoherent"  or  "selfish,"  such 
as  a  desire  for  adventure.  Some  students  also  came  from  families 
with  a  strong  military  tradition.  In  the  mid-1970s,  about  14  per- 
cent of  the  students  at  the  Gyorgy  Kilian  Technical  Air  Force 
Academy  and  19  percent  of  those  sent  to  study  at  Soviet  military 
colleges  had  at  least  one  parent  with  a  military  background. 

Warrant  officers  were  selected  from  career  servicemen  and  con- 
scripts. They  could  not  be  older  than  twenty-three,  and  they  had 
to  have  had  at  least  an  eight-year  general  (elementary)  school  edu- 
cation certificate.  Their  training  took  two  years,  and  they  could 
be  promoted  to  the  rank  of  sergeant  or  staff  sergeant.  They  were 
obligated  to  serve  at  least  twelve  years. 

Officers  and  regimental  sergeants  major  (sergeant,  master  ser- 
geant, and  sergeant  major)  in  the  military  were  compensated  rela- 
tively well.  Although  starting  salaries  were  low,  they  more  than 
doubled  after  fifteen  to  twenty  years  of  service.  Officers  also  received 
an  additional  clothing  allowance.  They  could  retire  at  age  fifty- 
five  instead  of  age  sixty  (the  age  required  for  the  rest  of  the  popu- 
lation), and  their  pensions  totaled  60  to  90  percent  of  the  average 
of  their  last  five  years'  salaries.  They  also  received  from  twenty- 
five  to  thirty-seven  days  of  vacation  a  year. 

However,  the  professional  military  life  also  had  its  disadvantages. 
Officers  could  not  engage  in  the  second,  unofficial  economy  and 
were  thus  required  to  live  solely  off  their  salaries,  a  difficult  situa- 
tion in  Hungary  (see  Domestic  Consumption,  ch.  3).  The  hous- 
ing provided  by  the  military  was  both  cramped  and  substandard. 
A  professional  soldier  could  be  assigned  to  four  or  five  different 
garrisons  during  his  career,  requiring  moves  by  the  entire  family. 
In  some  locations,  wives  could  not  easily  find  suitable  employment, 
essential  foods,  and  social  services.  Military  authorities  were  very 
concerned  about  the  increasing  alienation  and  materialism  and  the 
resulting  high  rates  of  alcoholism,  suicide,  and  divorce  among 
officers  of  the  HPA. 

Premilitary  Programs 

Hungarian  schools  required  some  military  education  for  all  stu- 
dents from  the  seventh  grade  through  secondary  school  and  higher 
education.  The  regime  saw  military  education  as  an  integral  part 
of  general  education,  a  way  by  which  young  people  could  acquire 
the  skills  they  would  need  when  serving  in  the  army  and  a  means 
to  increase  the  defense  capability  of  the  country.  Such  training  in- 
cluded weapons  maintenance  and  use,  radio  communications, 


250 


National  Security 


electronic  and  mechanical  engineering,  aircraft  piloting,  parachute 
training,  and  scuba  diving. 

Actual  premilitary  training  was  optional  but  was  advised  before 
age  seventeen  and  obligatory  from  age  seventeen  to  call-up,  up  to 
age  twenty-three.  No  more  than  two  years  of  such  training  could 
be  required.  This  training  could  assume  different  forms,  includ- 
ing a  camp  setting.  In  1984  the  MHSz  and  the  Pioneer  youth  or- 
ganization established  such  a  camp  for  premilitary  training  on 
Szentendre  Island  in  the  Danube,  north  of  Budapest.  In  1987  nearly 
150  secondary  students  attended,  half  the  number  that  applied. 
The  boys  were  placed  in  radio  communications  and  shooting 
groups,  while  both  girls  and  boys  participated  in  sports.  Various 
programs  included  military  theory  and  practice,  computer  games, 
movies,  "patrol  competitions,"  sports,  and  excursions.  Soldiers 
supervised  some  activities,  and  the  HP  A  provided  the  meals. 

Paramilitary  Programs 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  MHSz  gave  lessons  and  courses  related 
to  defense  and  civil  defense,  and  it  aided  in  the  premilitary  train- 
ing of  young  people  and  in  military  training  for  reservists.  The 
MHSz  resembled  the  Soviet  Voluntary  Society  for  the  Promotion 
of  the  Army,  Air  Force,  and  Navy  (Vsesoiuznoe  Dobrovol'noe 
Obshchestvo  Sodeistviia  Armii,  Aviatsii,  i  Flotu — DOSAAF). 

In  small  villages,  men  were  required  to  take  part  in  weapons 
training,  using  air  guns,  at  least  once  a  year.  All  adults  were  also 
obliged  to  participate  in  civil  defense  drills,  using  as  masks. 

In  the  cities,  workers  in  large  organizations  formed  "civil  defense 
chains,"  a  system  of  notifying  co-workers  to  meet  at  a  prearranged 
place  during  a  civil  emergency.  Every  year  each  workplace  held 
at  least  one  civil  defense  drill. 

Uniforms  and  Rank  Insignia 

In  1989  the  army  had  approximately  the  same  number  of  ranks 
found  in  other  typical  military  organizations,  but  these  ranks  were 
grouped  into  six  classifications,  the  names  of  which  did  not  always 
translate  readily  to  those  used  by  other  military  organizations.  Com- 
missioned officer  ranks,  however,  were  standard  and  ranged  from 
second  lieutenant  to  general.  They  included  four  general  officer 
ranks:  brigadier  general,  lieutenant  general,  colonel  general,  and 
army  general.  Field  grades  were  major,  lieutenant  colonel,  and 
colonel.  Junior  officer  ranks  began  with  sublieutenant  and  advanced 
through  second  lieutenant  and  first  lieutenant  to  captain. 

Enlisted  grade  nomenclature  differed  from  that  used  by  most 
of  the  world's  armies.  The  three  lowest  grades — private  first  class, 


251 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

corporal,  and  lance  sergeant — were  called  noncommissioned 
officers.  The  next  four  grades — staff  sergeant,  sergeant  first  class, 
master  sergeant,  and  command  sergeant  major — were  called 
regimental  sergeants  major;  in  the  armies  of  most  countries  these 
ranks  would  also  be  included  among  the  NCO  grades.  Above  the 
regimental  sergeants  major  but  below  the  lowest  commissioned 
officer  ranks  were  two  grades  that  were  translated  as  ensigns,  which 
were  the  equivalent  of  warrant  officers  in  other  armies. 

Rank  insignia  consisted  of  shoulder  boards  for  officers,  ensigns, 
and  higher-grade  enlisted  men  (see  fig.  11).  Lower  grades  wore 
patches  on  shirt  or  blouse  collars.  Rank  was  indicated  by  the  amount 
of  ornamentation  and  the  number  of  stars  on  the  shoulder  board. 
Officers  had  gold  piping  around  the  edges  of  the  boards;  ensigns 
and  enlisted  men  had  silver.  Generals'  stars  were  placed  upon  a 
solid  gold  braid  background.  Junior  officers'  boards  did  not  have 
braiding;  officers  of  field  grades  had  boards  that  were  partly  braided. 
Except  for  the  outer  braiding,  boards  of  the  higher-grade  enlisted 
men  resembled  those  of  junior  officers.  Background  colors  and 
bronze  devices  identified  service  branches.  Uniforms  were 
brownish-olive  drab.  Enlisted  men  wore  heavy  wool  in  winter  and 
a  lighter  colored  cotton  in  the  warmer  seasons.  Officers  wore  the 
same  colors,  but  the  materials  were  worsted  wool  for  winter  and 
either  cotton  or  tropical-weight  worsted  wool  for  summer.  The  most 
frequentiy  seen  uniforms  were  the  service,  dress,  and  field  uniforms. 
The  service  uniform  was  worn  for  most  light-duty  work,  recrea- 
tion, and  informal  social  occasions.  It  consisted  of  a  comfortably 
fitting  "blouse,"  long  trousers,  and  low  shoes.  In  summer  a  lighter- 
weight,  light-colored  shirt  was  worn  instead  of  the  blouse.  The  dress 
uniform  consisted  of  the  same  blouse  and  trousers  but  had  extra 
ornamentation,  and  the  trousers  were  tucked  into  high  boots. 
Officers  wore  a  Sam  Browne  belt  (a  belt  with  a  strap  over  the  right 
shoulder)  and,  for  the  most  formal  occasions,  a  sword.  Field  uni- 
forms included  high  boots  into  which  the  trousers  were  tucked.  In 
summer  the  officers'  field  uniforms  included  a  short  jacket,  Sam 
Browne  belt,  and  sidearm;  enlisted  men's  uniforms  had  a  cotton 
shirt,  which  could  be  worn  with  the  sleeves  rolled  up.  A  heavy  over- 
coat was  added  in  the  winter. 

Twelve  decorations  were  still  being  awarded  in  the  late  1980s 
for  extraordinary  achievement,  special  merit,  or  outstanding  per- 
formance. Another  twenty-four  were  authorized  to  be  worn  but 
were  no  longer  awarded.  A  few  of  those  had  been  discontinued, 
but  most  of  them  were  applicable  to  earlier  service,  such  as  during 
World  War  II  or  the  communist  takeover  after  the  war.

National  Security 


The  highest-ranking  decoration  was  the  Hero  of  Socialist  Labor. 
It  was  followed  in  order  by  the  Medal  of  the  Hungarian  People's 
Republic,  the  Red  Banner  Order  of  Merit,  and  the  Red  Star  Order 
of  Merit.  Some  of  these  decorations  were  awarded  in  two  or  more 
degrees,  in  which  the  first  degree  was  the  highest  class.  The  Order 
of  Merit  for  Outstanding  Service  was  frequently  awarded  to  higher- 
ranking  military  personnel.  Although  it  ranked  twenty-fourth  in 
the  list  of  thirty-six  decorations,  it  was  one  of  the  few  that  was 
accompanied  by  a  monetary  award.  A  substantial  pension  supple- 
ment accompanied  three  or  four  of  the  more  important  decorations. 

Internal  Security  and  Public  Order 

In  1989  the  Ministry  of  Interior  was  responsible  for  public  order, 
public  safety,  internal  security,  and,  since  the  beginning  of  1988, 
public  administration.  The  ministry  controlled  the  armed  security 
organizations  in  the  country — the  National  Police,  the  Security 
Police,  and  the  Border  Guard — but  not  the  Workers'  Guard,  which 
was  subject  directly  to  the  HSWP.  The  ministry  was  also  respon- 
sible for  such  diverse  tasks  as  fire  prevention  and  passport  control. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  government  attempted  to  limit  the  minis- 
try's arbitrary  use  of  power  or  at  least  tried  to  clean  up  its  public 
image.  In  an  interview  in  June  1989,  Minister  of  Interior  Istvan 
Horvath  suggested  that  the  ministry  ought  to  transfer  its  control 
of  the  Security  Police  to  the  local  governments. 

National  Police 

The  public  police  forces  performed  routine  police  duties  through- 
out the  country.  Although  they  operated  within  local  jurisdictions, 
they  were  centrally  organized  and  controlled  by  the  Ministry  of 
Interior. 

To  become  a  public  police  officer,  a  candidate  had  to  have 
finished  general  elementary  school  and,  in  theory,  to  have  com- 
pleted two  ten-month  training  periods.  However,  most  officers 
serving  in  1989,  according  to  the  Ministry  of  Interior,  did  not  have 
this  kind  of  education.  In  the  late  1980s,  morale  problems  affected 
the  police.  Inflation  had  eaten  away  their  salaries,  and  the  crime 
increases  had  overburdened  their  work  loads  (see  Incidence  of 
Crime,  this  ch.).  In  addition,  policemen  could  not  travel  to  the 
West.  On  July  5,  1989,  policemen  founded  the  Independent  Police- 
men's Trade  Union  to  protect  their  interests. 

As  Hungary  inched  toward  democracy  during  the  late  1980s  the 
populace  felt  freer  to  criticize  the  police.  The  Ministry  of  Interior, 
in  turn,  felt  obliged  to  publicize  reforms.  For  example,  in  April 
1989,  the  Federation  of  Young  Democrats  staged  a  sit-in  in  front

of  the  headquarters  of  the  Ministry  of  Interior.  This  organization 
was  protesting  the  lenient  sentences  given  by  military  courts  to 
policemen  who  committed  brutality.  Federation  members  de- 
manded that  the  minister  of  interior  resign  and  that  the  ministry 
be  removed  from  party  control. 

More  surprising  was  the  ministry's  reaction  to  this  criticism.  In 
a  press  conference,  a  ministry  spokesperson  claimed  that  the  "direct 
supervision"  of  the  ministry  had  indeed  been  transferred  to  the 
government.  During  the  same  month,  a  ministry  spokesperson  con- 
demned the  acts  of  some  police  officers  who  had  abused  their 
authority  and  engaged  in  "impermissible  activities."  In  the  late 
1980s,  the  ministry  appeared  to  be  concerned  with  its  public  image 
and  claimed  to  be  investigating  "all  allegations"  of  unlawful  or 
improper  activities  by  its  agents.  In  a  rather  euphemistic  but  tell- 
ing statement,  Minister  of  Interior  Horvath  proclaimed  in  August 
1989  that  "protection  of  the  public  order  [must]  be  provided 
according  to  European  standards  in  the  late  20th  century." 

Security  Police 

In  the  late  1980s,  Hungary's  15,000  member  Security  Police  was 
controlled  by  the  Ministry  of  Interior.  However,  unique  among 
Warsaw  Pact  countries,  Hungary  lacked  a  uniformed  security  police 
force.  Such  a  force — the  AVO — had  existed  but  was  disbanded  in 
October  1956  (see  Background  and  Traditions,  this  ch.).  Given 
the  vehemence  with  which  the  public  hated  the  AVO  and  associated 
it  with  the  Stalinist  terror,  the  Kadar  regime  saw  fit  not  to  revive 
it,  even  under  a  different  name.  Nevertheless,  until  the  late  1980s 
the  Security  Police  continued  to  harass  and  arrest  those  persons 
deemed  to  be  political  enemies. 

The  reform  of  the  political  system  during  the  second  half  of  the 
1980s  appeared  to  have  also  affected  the  Security  Police.  In  an  in- 
terview on  Hungarian  television  in  July  1989,  Minister  of  Interior 
Horvath  claimed  that  the  Security  Police  no  longer  viewed  the 
domestic  opposition  as  political  enemies,  an  image  that  had  be- 
come "obsolete"  in  a  multiparty  system.  He  condemned  previ- 
ous Security  Police  actions,  such  as  harassing  and  detaining  known 
dissidents  before  national  holidays  as  "a  bad  reflex  action  of  a  differ- 
ent type  of  power  structure."  Horvath  stressed  that  the  Security 
Police  did  have  a  legitimate  intelligence  and  counterintelligence 
function  but  was  not  an  organization  "placed  above  the  citizens." 

Border  Guard 

In  1989  Hungary's  Border  Guard  numbered  16,000,  operating 
in  eleven  districts.  Conscripts  totaled  1 1 ,000,  or  nearly  70  percent 


255 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

of  the  total.  Although  nominally  controlled  by  the  HPA,  the  Border 
Guard  Headquarters  of  the  Ministry  of  Interior  took  orders  from 
both  the  party  Basic  Organization  in  the  ministry  and  the  Govern- 
ment Administration  and  Administrative  Department  of  the 
HSWP's  Secretariat  (see  Party  Structure,  ch.  4).  The  Border  Guard 
Command  was  established  in  1946  and  reorganized  in  1950.  Its 
tasks  were  governed  by  Decree  Number  40/1974,  which  brought 
border  regulations  into  conformity  with  those  of  other  Warsaw  Pact 
countries.  The  exact  level  of  party  and  Communist  Young  League 
membership  among  the  Border  Guard  was  unknown,  but  it  was 
certainly  higher  than  that  of  the  army.  For  this  reason,  Volgyes 
argued  that  the  regime  may  have  considered  this  organization  to 
be  more  reliable  than  the  army  as  a  whole,  although  the  high  per- 
centage of  conscripts  left  this  contention  open  to  question. 

Border  Guard  work  in  Hungary  required  a  high  level  of  educa- 
tion, political  training,  good  health,  "good  appearance,"  and  even 
a  knowledge  of  the  foreign  languages  necessary  for  work  at  border 
crossing  stations.  Statistics  from  1987  showed  that  40  percent  of 
guards  at  border  crossing  points  had  finished  secondary  school  or 
university.  In  1986  border  guards  checked  the  documents  of  50 
million  people  visiting  or  transiting  Hungary  through  sixty-six  high- 
way, rail,  river,  and  air  border  crossing  points. 

In  the  late  1980s,  a  permit  was  nominally  required  to  enter  a 
narrow  zone  along  the  western  and  southern  borders,  but  accord- 
ing to  Major  General  Janos  Szekely,  chief  of  the  Border  Guard 
Headquarters,  "anyone  who  applies  to  the  proper  agency  for  a  per- 
mit usually  gets  it."  An  estimated  900  voluntary  Border  Guard 
auxiliary  groups  aided  in  the  arrest  of  about  20  percent  of  border 
violators. 

During  the  late  1980s,  Hungary's  borders  with  two  countries 
received  international  attention.  On  May  3,  1989,  Hungarian  sol- 
diers began  removing  the  barbed  wire  fence  on  the  border  with 
Austria.  Calling  the  fence  "outdated"  and  superfluous,  given  the 
existence  of  Hungary's  new  (1988)  liberal  passport  law,  the  Hun- 
garian government  publicly  stated  that  all  sections  of  the  fence  would 
be  removed  by  the  end  of  1990.  Although  the  Austrian  govern- 
ment publicly  welcomed  this  development,  it  privately  feared  that 
other  East  Europeans,  especially  Romanians,  would  travel  to  Hun- 
gary in  order  to  escape  into  Austria. 

It  was  not  Romanians  but  East  Germans  touring  Hungary  in 
the  summer  of  1989  who  took  advantage  of  the  newly  opened  border 
to  flee  to  Austria.  The  Hungarian  Border  Guard  interfered  only 
sporadically  with  this  flight,  and  eventually  the  Hungarian  govern- 
ment allowed  the  East  Germans  to  leave  through  Hungarian  border

checkpoints.  In  September  1989,  the  government  announced  that 
it  would  allow  all  the  East  Germans  in  the  country  wishing  to  emi- 
grate to  the  West  to  leave  Hungary.  By  the  beginning  of  October, 
more  than  35,000  had  left  the  country  to  go  to  West  Germany. 
The  East  German  government  protested  that  Hungary  had  reneged 
on  its  border  agreements  with  the  other  members  of  the  Warsaw 
Pact,  but  the  Hungarian  government  claimed  that  it  was  merely 
following  the  spirit  of  the  Helsinki  Accords  that  were  signed  as  part 
of  the  Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  in  1975 
and  the  border  remained  open. 

Workers'  Guard 

The  Workers'  Guard,  a  paramilitary  organization  directly  con- 
trolled by  the  HSWP,  claimed  to  have  60,000  members  in  1988. 
Possessing  only  small  arms,  its  mission  was  officially  limited  to  pro- 
tecting the  population  and  state  property  in  times  of  war  or  un- 
rest. In  fact,  the  Workers'  Guard  assisted  the  National  Police  and 
army  during  events  that  required  crowd  control.  The  guard  wore 
its  own  distinctive  gray  uniform. 

Directly  controlled  by  a  permanent  department  of  the  HSWP's 
Central  Committee,  the  Workers'  Guard  was,  in  effect,  the  party's 
private  army,  and  the  overwhelming  majority  of  the  guard  were 
party  members.  Founded  in  1957  shortly  after  the  revolution,  this 
organization  became  the  chief  protector  of  the  newly  formed  Kadar 
regime. 

In  June  1989,  the  government  announced  that  in  the  future  it, 
not  the  party,  would  have  control  over  the  Workers'  Guard  and 
that  many  of  the  functions  of  this  paramilitary  organization  would 
be  eliminated.  An  interministerial  committee  of  the  government 
was  formed  to  examine  the  mission  and  activities  of  the  guard  and 
perhaps  even  to  rename  it. 

Criminal  Justice  System 

Like  other  criminal  justice  systems  in  Marxist-Leninist  coun- 
tries, Hungary's  criminal  justice  system  was,  until  the  late  1980s, 
heavily  politicized.  The  system,  like  other  aspects  of  the  political 
system,  was  subject  not  to  the  rule  of  law  but  rather  to  the  whims 
of  the  party.  As  part  of  its  efforts  at  democratization  in  the  late 
1980s,  the  government  began  an  effort  to  create  an  independent 
judicial  system. 

Incidence  of  Crime 

Crimes  against  both  people  and  property  soared  during  the  1980s. 
Violent  crime,  which  also  increased  dramatically,  was  dispro- 
portionately committed  by  Gypsies  (see  Minority  Groups,  ch.  2). 


257 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

Gypsies  made  up  about  4.7  percent  of  the  population,  but  they 
numbered  54  percent  of  those  persons  convicted  of  murder  and 
rape  and  49  percent  of  those  convicted  of  robbery. 

Criminal  offenses  against  the  state  and  private  individuals  cost 
the  economy  nearly  US$50  million  in  1988,  or  0.5  percent  of  the 
country's  annual  budget.  Losses  from  criminal  offenses  against  pri- 
vate property  doubled  from  1987  to  1988.  White-collar  crime,  es- 
pecially bribery  of  office  executives,  also  rose,  and  the  country's 
efforts  to  increase  the  role  of  private  enterprise  led  to  a  new  type 
of  criminal  activity — money  laundering. 

By  contrast,  certain  other  types  of  activities  formerly  considered 
illegal  by  the  state  had  become  legal  under  new,  more  tolerant  laws. 
Thus,  in  the  late  1980s  liberalized  passport  and  customs  regula- 
tions reduced  currency  crimes  by  25  percent  and  smuggling  cases 
by  20  percent. 

In  the  1980s,  the  level  of  alcoholism  in  Hungary  grew  at  the 
fastest  rate  in  the  world.  In  the  1950s,  the  communist  regime  con- 
sidered alcoholism  to  be  a  "remnant  of  the  past,"  but  the  increase 
in  alcoholism  over  the  years  had  forced  the  government  to  pay  at- 
tention to  this  problem.  The  rapidly  rising  rate  of  alcohol  consump- 
tion was  fueled  by  an  increasing  number  of  women  and  youth  with 
drinking  problems.  About  120,000  children  lived  in  families  in 
which  one  or  both  parents  were  heavy  drinkers,  and  reports  sur- 
faced of  youth  gangs  drinking  in  Budapest  subway  stations. 

However,  the  government's  data  showed  that  at  least  in  the  work- 
place the  problem  of  alcoholism  was  diminishing,  rather  than  in- 
creasing. Surveys  taken  between  1985  and  1987  showed  that 
drunkenness  in  the  workplace  dropped  each  year:  from  9.1  per- 
cent in  1985,  to  3.7  percent  in  1986,  and  to  2.2  percent  in  1987. 
Nevertheless,  alcohol,  rather  than  controlled  substances,  was  related 
to  virtually  all  of  the  crimes  committed  under  the  influence  of  any 
type  of  drug.  In  the  first  eight  months  of  1988,  more  than  18,500 
crimes  were  committed  under  the  influence  of  alcohol,  while  37 
crimes  were  committed  under  the  influence  of  hard  drugs  (heroin 
and  cocaine)  and  84  under  the  influence  of  drug  substitutes. 

According  to  the  Ministry  of  Interior,  although  hard  drugs  were 
shipped  through  Hungary,  they  did  not  appear  to  be  a  serious 
problem  for  Hungarian  society.  In  the  late  1980s,  Ministry  of  In- 
terior statistics  cited  only  forty-five  to  fifty  prosecutions  per  year 
for  narcotics  violations.  Nevertheless,  the  use  of  hard  drugs  did 
appear  to  be  rising. 

The  use  of  drug  substitutes  or  the  abuse  of  prescription  drugs, 
however,  caused  the  government  serious  concern.  Abusers  obtained 
opium-based  and  other  drugs  from  hospitals,  pharmacies,  and  drug 


258 


National  Security 


factories  by  stealing,  by  forging  prescriptions,  or  by  buying  drugs 
from  staff  looking  for  extra  money.  Glue  sniffing  was  also  a  problem, 
especially  for  children  aged  seven  to  fifteen.  In  the  late  1980s,  the 
press  admitted  that  the  country  possibly  had  50,000  drug  addicts 
but  did  not  mention  the  drugs  responsible  for  addiction. 

Before  1984  the  government  had  denied  the  existence  of  a  drug 
problem,  but  since  then  the  subject  has  received  wide  public  dis- 
cussion. In  the  late  1980s,  laws  against  the  use  of  controlled  sub- 
stances were  flexible  and  gave  judges  the  ability  to  adjust  sentences 
according  to  the  quantity  of  the  drug  involved  and  the  age  of  the 
seller.  Those  persons  in  possession  of  "excessive  amounts"  could 
receive  up  to  an  eight-year  prison  term. 

Penal  Code  and  Criminal  Procedure 

Hungary's  legal  system  has  been  influenced  by  Roman  law.  The 
country's  first  written  law  code,  compiled  by  Stephen  Werboczy 
in  1514,  codified  the  unwritten  laws  and  customs  that  had  existed 
up  to  that  time.  The  Tripartitum,  as  this  codification  was  called, 
was  modified  over  the  following  centuries,  but  a  written,  formal 
law  code  was  not  officially  published  until  1878.  This  publication 
formed  the  basis  of  the  Penal  Code  appearing  in  the  early  1950s, 
but  many  articles  remained  unchanged  until  the  entire  code  was 
republished  in  1961. 

The  Penal  Code  and  a  decree  on  criminal  procedures  that  ap- 
peared in  1972  incorporated  constitutional  revisions  made  at  that 
time  (see  Amendments  of  1972,  ch.  4).  Both  the  code  and  the  decree 
reflected  the  subordination  of  the  legal  system  to  the  state,  and 
harsher  penalties  were  meted  out  for  crimes  against  the  state  and 
state  property  than  for  crimes  against  the  person  and  private 
property.  The  Penal  Code  was  revised  in  late  1978  and  again  in 
September  1989.  The  latest  revision,  which  still  required  the  ap- 
proval of  the  National  Assembly  as  of  September  1989,  abolished 
the  use  of  the  death  penalty  for  crimes  against  the  state. 

Hungary's  system  of  justice  did  not  subscribe  to  the  adversary 
system;  neither  did  it  recognize  common  law  or  precedent  (see 
Judicial  Organs,  ch.  4).  The  prosecutor  in  a  Hungarian  court  was 
responsible  for  presenting  all  the  evidence,  both  for  and  against 
the  defendant.  Defendants  had  the  right  to  legal  counsel,  who  at- 
tempted to  ensure  that  the  prosecutor's  presentation  of  the  case 
was  unbiased.  Judges  were  bound  by  the  law  as  written,  not  by 
the  decisions  of  other  judges.  The  judge's  interpretation  applied 
only  to  the  specific  case;  it  set  no  precedent  for  other  cases. 

Military  Justice 

Military  tribunals  were  part  of  Hungary's  judicial  system  and 


259 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 


were  responsible  to  the  minister  of  justice  and  to  the  minister  of 
defense.  A  military  council  of  the  Supreme  Court  reviewed  cases 
from  lower  military  tribunals  or  tried  the  most  serious  cases. 

Military  court  jurisdiction  was  usually  limited  to  cases  involv- 
ing military  personnel,  cases  involving  civilians  on  military  instal- 
lations, or  cases  involving  an  aspect  of  the  country's  defense. 
Military  courts  had  a  judge  and  two  lay  assessors  (non-professional 
judges),  whose  functions  were  similar  to  their  equivalents  in  civilian 
courts.  Military  judges  were  commissioned  professional  officers  with 
law  degrees.  Lay  assessors  were  chosen  from  all  ranks,  at  respec- 
tive meetings  of  officers,  regimental  sergeants  major,  and  enlisted 
personnel.  Members  of  the  court  had  to  have  a  rank  at  least  equal 
to  that  of  the  accused. 

Penal  System 

From  1949  to  1961 ,  the  penal  system  consisted  of  labor  or  intern- 
ment camps  and  prisons  with  three  types  of  disciplinary  regimes. 
By  1961  the  regime  claimed  it  had  abolished  the  labor  camps.  A 
law  eliminated  these  different  regimes,  but  a  new  system  contain- 
ing four  regimes  has  been  instituted  since.  Confinement  to  peniten- 
tiaries was  the  most  severe  regime  under  the  new  system,  while 
local  jails  provided  the  lightest.  Prisoners  sentenced  to  the  two  in- 
termediate regimes  were  assigned  to  one  of  two  different  types  of 
prisons.  In  1975  the  government  introduced  an  additional  regime 
for  convicts  who  committed  for  the  fourth  time  a  violent  crime  carry- 
ing a  sentence  of  more  than  one  year. 

In  July  1989,  a  prisoner  in  the  Vac  Prison  north  of  Budapest 
committed  self-immolation,  and  several  hundred  of  his  fellow 
prisoners  went  on  a  hunger  strike  to  protest  the  harshest  possible 
regime.  The  government  immediately  promised  to  abolish  this  re- 
gime, thus  affecting  282  male  and  14  female  prisoners. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  HPA  possessed  just  one  penal  battalion, 
located  in  Nagyatad  in  Somogy  County.  Soldiers  who  had  received 
seven-month  to  two-year  sentences  were  sent  there  to  perform 
manual  labor,  primarily  for  the  HPA  but  often  for  the  national 
economy.  Alcohol  played  a  part  in  two-thirds  of  crimes  commit- 
ted by  soldiers.  At  least  one-third  of  these  crimes  involved  violence 
against  superiors,  insubordination,  or  draft  dodging. 

Reaction  to  Political  Dissent 

As  with  the  constitutions  of  the  other  Warsaw  Pact  countries, 
Hungary's  Constitution  grants  rights  to  citizens  but  qualifies  these 
rights  so  that  they  are  meaningless  (see  Constitutional  Devel- 
opment, ch.  4).  For  example,  Chapter  VII,  Article  64  of  the 


260 


National  Security 


Constitution  gives  citizens  freedom  of  speech,  press,  and  assem- 
bly, yet  Section  54  states  that  citizens'  rights  "shall  be  exercised 
in  accordance  with  the  interests  of  socialism  and  the  people"  and 
that  these  rights  "shall  be  inseparable  from  the  fulfillment  of  the 
duties  of  citizens." 

Nevertheless,  from  the  1970s  well  into  the  1980s  Hungarians  had 
a  wider  latitude  to  criticize  their  government  than  did  other  East 
Europeans.  But  most  Hungarians  developed  a  "self-censorship" 
in  which  they  avoided  publicly  discussing  such  sensitive  topics 
as  one-party  rule  and  Hungary's  relations  with  the  Soviet  Union 
and  the  other  Warsaw  Pact  countries.  Hungarians  thus  generally 
avoided  problems  with  the  state,  while  the  state  gave  the  appear- 
ance of  tolerating  dissent. 

The  development  of  samizdat  in  the  early  1980s  provoked  a  severe 
government  reaction.  In  June  1982,  several  samizdat  editors  were 
subjected  to  police  surveillance,  and  later  in  the  year  one  was  fined 
4,000  forints  (for  value  of  the  forint — see  Glossary),  about  the  aver- 
age wage  for  one  month  at  that  time,  for  publishing  without  offi- 
cial permission.  In  the  following  months,  the  police  began  to  subject 
others  associated  with  samizdat  to  both  "light"  measures  (denial 
of  permission  to  travel  abroad,  periodic  house  searches,  detention, 
fines,  or  employment  difficulties)  to  those  of  outright  oppression 
(beatings  or  imprisonment).  The  regime  even  used  psychiatric 
methods  such  as  closed  wards  and  electric  shock  therapy  against 
dissidents.  In  1987  dissidents  were  still  subject  to  house  searches, 
and  in  1988  they  were  still  denied  passports. 

To  stop  the  tide  of  unofficial  publishing,  the  government  passed 
Decree  49/1984  (XI. 21),  which  required  that  all  duplicating 
machines  and  photocopiers  be  registered  with  the  state,  and  Decree 
4/1985  (VII20),  which  allowed  police  surveillance  and  even  expul- 
sion from  the  country  for  those  persons  whose  political  beliefs  the 
government  considered  a  danger  to  the  Hungarian  People's  Repub- 
lic, its  social  order,  or  public  security.  The  authorities  also  punished 
official  publishers  when  magazines  touched  upon  taboo  subjects. 
For  example,  in  1983  the  editor  of  Mozgo  Vildg  (World  in  Motion) 
lost  his  job  for  defying  party  directives.  In  1986  the  editors  of  Tiszatdj 
(Tisza  Country)  were  ordered  to  resign  because  of  articles  in  their 
journal  describing  the  horrible  situation  of  Hungarians  living  in 
Romania  (see  Mass  Media,  ch.  4). 

Rock  musicians  also  felt  the  state's  wrath  when  their  music  did 
not  meet  official  approval.  During  the  mid-1980s,  the  Committee 
of  Hungarian  Radio  censored  records  and  songs  because  they  were 
not  "optimistic  enough"  or  because  they  referred  to  drugs  or  to 


261 


Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

"red,  white,  and  green"  (the  colors  of  the  precommunist  Hungarian 
flag). 

Unauthorized  street  demonstrations  were  also  harshly  punished 
in  the  mid-1980s.  In  1986  the  police  brutally  broke  up  a  demon- 
stration held  on  March  15  to  commemorate  Hungary's  declara- 
tion of  independence  from  the  Habsburg  Empire  in  1848.  Unofficial 
peace  and  environmental  groups  were  also  harassed  when  attempt- 
ing to  meet  publicly. 

However,  political  reforms  of  the  late  1980s  softened  the  govern- 
ment's view  of  dissent,  although  its  behavior  remained  ambigu- 
ous. In  October  1988,  street  demonstrations  commemorating  the 
revolution  were  tolerated,  and  a  relatively  free  press  arose.  The 
government  spoke  openly  about  liberalizing  its  passport  law.  Yet 
a  Miskolc  court  in  1988  handed  an  elderly,  disabled  pensioner  a 
one-and-a-half-year  suspended  sentence  for  writing  an  open  letter 
to  the  HSWP  in  which  he  criticized  "  domestic  conditions  and  cer- 
tain leaders."  Legal  sanctions  resulting  from  involvement  in  the 
Revolution  of  1956  were  lifted  for  twelve  people  but  remained  for 
another  fifty-four. 

Hence,  as  of  1989  the  government's  record  on  dissent,  as  with 
other  aspects  of  the  reform  of  the  national  security  system,  was 
mixed.  To  be  sure,  regime  leaders  repeatedly  announced  their  in- 
tent to  reform,  and,  indeed,  many  important  steps  were  taken  in 
that  direction.  But  as  Hungarian  dissident  Miklos  Haraszti  re- 
minded his  audience  in  1989,  Hungary  was  still  "a  country  with 
powerful  bureaucrats,  with  the  same  armed  forces,  and  with  a  po- 
litical police."

Unfortunately,  few  English-language  sources  deal  with  the  past 
and  present  Hungarian  military.  English-language  sources  for  Hun- 
garian military  history  are  almost  nonexistent  outside  of  the  few 
standard  surveys  of  Hungarian  history,  such  as  Denis  Sinor's  History 
of  Hungary.  A  notable  exception  is  Bela  K.  Kiraly's  Hungary  in  the 
Late  Eighteenth  Century,  which  sets  forth  detailed  information  about 
the  Hungarian-Habsburg  military  structure  of  that  time.  Peter 
Weiss's  "The  Hungarian  Armed  Forces  Today"  provided  the  most 
current  information  at  the  time  of  this  writing.  An  excellent  over- 
view of  the  HPA  since  World  War  II  is  given  by  Ivan  Volgyes  in 
his  article  "Hungary."  F.  Rubin's  "The  Hungarian  People's 
Army"  is  also  useful  but  dated.  For  information  about  the  HPA's 
force  strengths  and  weaponry,  no  source  is  better  than  the  Inter- 
national Institute  for  Strategic  Studies'  annual  The  Military  Balance.

National  Security 


Radio  Free  Europe  occasionally  produces  articles  that  treat  Hun- 
garian military  matters.  Some  translations  produced  by  the  Joint 
Publications  Research  Service  and  the  Foreign  Broadcast  Infor- 
mation Service  concern  questions  of  Hungary's  national  security.

Glossary 


Comecon — Council  for  Mutual  Economic  Assistance.  Sometimes 
cited  as  CMEA  or  CEMA.  Members  in  1989  included  Bul- 
garia, Cuba,  Czechoslovakia,  the  German  Democratic  Republic 
(East  Germany),  Hungary,  the  Mongolian  People's  Republic 
(Mongolia),  Poland,  Romania,  the  Soviet  Union,  and  Viet- 
nam. Its  purpose  was  to  further  economic  cooperation  among 
members. 

corvee — Number  of  days  each  week  that  the  serf  was  required  to 
work  for  his  lord. 

entail  system — Form  of  inheritance  by  which  land  passed  to  the 
owner's  male  descendents  or,  if  he  had  no  male  heir,  to  the 
crown.  Entail  checked  Hungary's  economic  development  be- 
cause it  prevented  the  nobles  from  selling  their  land  or  using 
it  as  collateral  to  obtain  credit. 

forint — National  currency  of  Hungary.  As  of  July  1989,  the  offi- 
cial exchange  rate  was  62.28  forints  to  US$1. 

gross  domestic  product  (GDP) — Includes  "transferred  value"  (cost 
of  materials)  and  "newly  created  value"  (profits  and  wages). 
"Nonproductive"  activities  (services)  are  not  included  in  GDP; 
thus,  it  is  not  comparable  with  the  Western  concept  of  gross 
national  product  (GNP). 

Hofkriegsrat — Central  organ  for  all  military  matters  in  the  Habs- 
burg  lands. 

International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) — Established  along  with  the 
World  Bank  (q.v.)  in  1945,  the  IMF  is  a  specialized  agency 
affiliated  with  the  United  Nations  that  takes  responsibility  for 
stabilizing  international  exchange  rates  and  payments.  The 
main  business  of  the  IMF  is  the  provision  of  loans  to  its  mem- 
bers when  they  experience  balance  of  payments  difficulties. 
These  loans  often  carry  conditions  that  require  substantial  in- 
ternal economic  adjustments  by  the  recipients. 

nomenklatura — From  the  Latin  nomenclature.  This  Russian  word 
denotes  an  enumeration  of  important  positions  and  the  candi- 
dates who  are  examined,  recommended,  and  assigned  to  fill 
them  by  communist  party  committees  at  various  levels. 

palatine — Originally  created  in  the  fifteenth  century.  Highest  office- 
holder in  Hungary  in  the  eighteenth  century;  in  theory,  the 
commander  in  chief  of  the  Hungarian  armed  forces. 

Pannonia — Former  Roman  province  west  of  the  Danube  in  present- 
day  Hungary  and  northern  Yugoslavia.

Hungary:  A  Country  Study 

Party  Rules — HSWP  document,  which  can  be  altered  by  the  party 
congress.  The  Party  Rules  contain  sections  on  regulations  for 
admission  into  the  HSWP,  the  organizational  structure  of  the 
party,  the  principles  of  democratic  centralism,  the  role  of  the 
Basic  Organization,  the  tasks  of  the  party  in  state  and  mass 
organizations,  and  membership  dues. 

Petofi  Circle — A  group  formed  in  1956  named  after  the  nineteenth- 
century  poet  and  revolutionary  Sandor  Petofi,  who  symbolized 
Hungary's  desire  for  freedom.  Made  up  of  liberal  writers,  in- 
tellectuals, and  some  communists,  the  circle  generated  the  ideas 
that  led  to  the  Revolution  of  1956. 

value-added  tax — A  tax  applied  to  the  additional  value  created  at 
a  given  stage  of  production  and  calculated  as  the  difference  be- 
tween the  product  value  at  that  stage  and  the  cost  of  all  materials 
and  services  purchased  as  inputs. 

Warsaw  Pact — Political-military  alliance  founded  in  1955  as  a  coun- 
terweight to  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization.  Mem- 
bers in  1989  included  Bulgaria,  Czechoslovakia,  East  Germany, 
Hungary,  Poland,  Romania,  and  the  Soviet  Union.  Has  served 
as  the  Soviet  Union's  primary  mechanism  for  keeping  politi- 
cal and  military  control  over  Eastern  Europe. 

World  Bank — Informal  name  used  to  designate  a  group  of  three 
affiliated  international  institutions:  the  International  Bank  for 
Reconstruction  and  Development  (IBRD),  the  International 
Development  Association  (IDA),  and  the  International  Finance 
Corporation  (IFC).  The  IBRD,  established  in  1945,  has  the 
primary  purpose  of  providing  loans  to  developing  countries  for 
productive  projects.  The  IDA,  a  legally  separate  loan  fund 
administered  by  the  staff  of  the  IBRD,  was  set  up  in  1960  to 
furnish  credits  to  the  poorest  developing  countries  on  much  eas- 
ier terms  than  those  of  conventional  IBRD  loans.  The  IFC, 
founded  in  1956,  supplements  the  activities  of  the  IBRD 
through  loans  and  assistance  designed  specifically  to  encourage 
the  growth  of  productive  private  enterprises  in  less-developed 
countries.  The  president  and  certain  senior  members  of  the 
IBRD  hold  the  same  positions  in  the  IFC.  The  three  institu- 
tions are  owned  by  the  governments  of  the  countries  that  sub- 
scribe their  capital.  To  participate  in  the  World  Bank  group, 
member  states  must  first  belong  to  the  IMF  {q.v.).
