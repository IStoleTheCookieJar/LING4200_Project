Serving the Gay & Lesbian Community for more than 27 years 


Harvey Milk in retrospect 


Who 
he was 

by Wayne Friday 

A reporter asked me last week what I 
thought former Supervisor Harvey 
Milk would be like if he hadn’t been 
murdered with Mayor George Moscone 
during the double assassination in San 
Francisco’s City Hall of November 27,1978. 
While it is really impossible to know for 
sure, I do know it’s likely that he would be 
pleased - but not satisfied - with the 
progress the gay rights movement has made 
in the 20 years since his death. 

Harvey would be 68 years old if he were 
alive, and while it is difficult for me to pic¬ 
ture him as a man nearing 70,it is not hard 
to imagine him still being a Firebrand ac¬ 
tivist, albeit a senior firebrand activist. In 
fact, if he had lived, I believe Harvey Milk 
would have served a couple of terms as this 
city’s first openly gay mayor - and a hell of 
a good mayor he would have been. 

A rising political star of the growing na¬ 
tional gay rights movement when he was 
killed, Milk knew full well what responsi¬ 
bility that role carried with it. He was a dar¬ 
ling of the media, which he knew only too 
well how to handle, and although some 
who knew him have described him as both 
an idealist and an opportunist - which he 
indeed was - he took himself seriously 
(sometimes more than others did) and 
knew full well what he wanted for the gay 
rights movement. 

Our last night 

I remember the last time I saw Harvey 
alive. He was at my house for my birthday

Icon and iconoclast 

San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk 
will.be remembered at a candlelight 
march this Friday, November 27. ft is 
the 20th anniversary of the double assas¬ 
sination of Milk and Mayor George 
Moscone at the hands of Dan White, also 
a former San Francisco, supervisor; The 
march begins at 6:30 p.m. at tire site of 
Milk's former camera store on Castro, 
near 19th Street. It wilt conclude oo the 
Poik Street side of City Haft, where the 
murders were committed. 




Who he 
has become 

by Jonathan Katz, 
Executive director, 
the Harvey Milk Institute 

L eaders are assassinated. That’s the sad 
fact of leadership in America. I’m 
(barely) of the generation of King 
and Kennedy, so I know this well. In my 
youth, the killing of true leaders - the ones 
possessed of an ethical vision beyond the 
immediately expedient - was something we 
almost expected. It was after all, the Viet¬ 
nam era and domestic political violence was 
hardly news. By the time Harvey Milk was 
killed, political assassination in America 
was old hat. Milk, as his tape recorded po¬ 
litical will makes clear, expected it. People 
around Milk expected it. And when I first 
got word of the killings, like so many others, 

1 was hardly surprised. 

So it is with some trepidation that I want . 
to make the following claim: it’s not that ~tp 
oiir leaders were kitted; lather it was be¬ 
cause they were murdered that political fig¬ 
ures were made into our leaders. Murder 
made Harvey Milk, transformed him from 
local legend to international icon. Despite 
his considerable political skills and charis¬ 
matic presence, Milk would have remained 
ours alone had he not been murdered. 
Alive, he fought against dog poop on San 
Francisco sidewalks and built bridges to 
local unions. Dead, he catalyzed a far-reach- 
mg political movement, personified a newly 
out gay politics and inspired generations of 
queer activists. 

was, after all, a San Franciscan - de¬

Georgia sodomy law overturned 

United Press International 


Castro holiday 
tree lighting 
ceremony set 
for Sunday 

by Cynthia Laird 

embers of Merchants of 
Upper Market and Castro 
(MUMC) invite everyone to 
join them, along with Metropolitan 
Community Church-San Francisco 
and local dignitaries, as they officially 
light this year’s holiday tree this Sun¬ 
day, November 29 in front of the 
Bank of America building at 18th and 
Castro streets. 

The theme for this year’s tree is 
"When You Wish Upon A Star,” and 
MUMC President Patrick Batt said 
that thanks to the support of local 
merchants and community organiza¬ 
tions, this year’s tree will be adorned 
with more than 4,000 lights and 100 
grapevine gold stars with rainbow- 
colored, metallic ribbon forming the 
tails of shooting stars.

T he Georgia Supreme Court did what the 
U.S. Supreme Court would not do a 
dozen years ago: it ruled Monday, No¬ 
vember 23 that the state’s sodomy law is an in¬ 
defensible intrusion into citizens’ right to pri¬ 
vacy guaranteed under the state’s constitution. 

In a 6 to 1 decision, the court declared the 
law as unconstitutional because it “criminal¬ 
izes the performance of private, non-com¬ 
mercial acts of sexual intimacy.” 

“We cannot think of any other activity 
that reasonable persons would rank as more 
private and more deserving of protection 
from governmental interference than con¬ 
sensual, private, adult sexual activity,” the 
court’s opinion said. 

Today’s ruling - the second challenge to 
the sodomy law in three years - came in the 
case of a Georgia man who was sentenced to 
five years in prison for consensual oral sex 
with his 17-year-old niece. 

Anthony San Juan Powell was convicted 
of sodomy in August 1997 after he admitted 
having oral sex with the girl in his home. 

His attorney, Steve Sadow, told the 
Supreme Court in May that of the 30 states 
that had made sodomy a crime, eight of them, 
most recently Minnesota, had overturned 


their sodomy laws on privacy grounds. 

Gwinnett County District Attorney 
Danny Porter defended the law as necessary 
because Powell’s sexual encounter was not 
consensual. 

But the Supreme Court said that other 
statutes, such as those prohibiting sexual as¬ 
sault, child molestation, and public sex, pro¬ 
tected the public from sexual assaults. 

The Georgia Supreme Court had upheld 
the sodomy law in a 1996 decision involving 
a man who solicited oral sex from an under¬ 
cover sheriff’s deputy at a rest area off an in¬ 
terstate highway. 

White ridicule 

The law went before the U.S. Supreme 
Court in the case of Atlanta resident Michael 
Hardwick. A police officer who entered 
Hardwick’s bedroom to serve a warrant wit¬ 
nessed Hardwick having sex with another 
man, and arrested him. Although the charges 
were eventually dropped, the case slowly 
went forward to the nation’s high court. 

The arrest in Bowers v. Hardwick was in 
1982. The ruling was handed down on June 
30,1986, one day after gay and lesbian pride 
celebrations. Justice Byron White wrote the 5 
to 4 majority opinion rejecting the grounds 
of privacy, and Judge Harry Blackmun au¬ 
thored the strong dissent. “Depriving indi¬ 


viduals of the right to choose for themselves 
how to conduct their intimate relationships,” 
he wrote, “poses a far greater threat to the 
values most deeply rooted in our Nation’s 
history than tolerance of nonconformity

New Postal Retail 
Store upsets Castro 



by Mark Norby 


he Castro neighborhood’s 
new Postal Retail Store at 

!! 18th Street and Diamond, 
which opened November 9, is re¬ 
ceiving mixed reviews and has 
many area residents calling for a 
return to the former, more func¬ 
tional pqgt office. 

The former post office that 
everyone was accustomed to, open 
since the area was popularly known 
simply as Eureka Valley, was atyp¬ 
ical postal center. Customers en¬ 
tered, waited in line to buy stamps 
or send or pick up packages, or 
checked rented mail boxes. 

In contrast, the new Postal Re¬ 
tail Store is a commercial venture 
where patrons mayjbuy a myriad 
of “designer stamps,” coffee mugs, 
T-shirts, key chains, and whatnot. 
But when it comes to retrieving 
parcels, they’re out of luck: resi¬ 
dents of the Castro must now 
venture an additional 18 blocks to 
the postal station at 15th and 
Bryant streets. 

The opening of the new store 
comes in the midst of the arrival 
of the holiday season, reinforcing 
for many residents the difficulty 
presented by the new, less func¬ 
tional Postal Retail Store. 

Residents will not enjoy the 
convenience of sending and pick¬ 
ing up holiday packages from the 
post office they were accustomed 
to. 

In addition, prescriptions and 
other essential medical aids will 
no longer be delivered to the new 
store and has left people with 
AIDS (PWA) without a vital 
health convenience. 


Undelivered mail will also 
need to be retrieved from the 
Bryant Street station. 

‘What were 
they thinking?’ 

Jim Dewsnap, a Castro resi¬ 
dent who is urging the communi¬ 
ty to protest the inconvenience by 
calling or writing the postmaster, 
wants residents to “turn this thing 
around. What were they thinking 
by putting a postal store in a resi¬ 
dential neighborhood. I ask that 
[the postmaster] reconsider this 
rather thoughtless decision so 
that postal customers in the ZIP 
codes affected by it get back the 
service they once had.” 

“If space is a problem,” Dews¬ 
nap continues, “the conference 
room at the new facility might 


make a good parcel pick-up and 
storage area.” 

Postal Retail Stores apparently 
are the wave of the future and 
their numbers are increasingly re¬ 
placing standard, old-fashioned 
neighborhood post offices. The 
first Postal Retail Store was 
opened in 1996 in the Mall of 
America in Minnesota, the largest 
retail facility in the U.S. T

Castro bars changing ...but not much 


by Ed Walsh 


ontrary to rumors sweeping 
the Castro, Badlands will 
" - ’ • not be going to Never-Never 
Land anytime soon. 

The Bay Area Reporter has 
learned that the sale of the land¬ 
mark bar is pending, but the 
prospective new owner, Les Na¬ 
tali, plans to keep the Badlands 
name and to keep the popular bar 
pretty much the same, except for 
some minor upgrades. 

Frank McGrady, the current 


owner of Badlands, declined com¬ 
ment but assessor’s records show 
he purchased the property in 1977 
for $250,000. It is currently as¬ 
sessed at $462,500. 

Natali, who currently owns the 
Patio Cafe, confirms that he is in 
escrow to buy Badlands, but he 
tells the B.A.R. that the sale is con¬ 
tingent on his loan going through 
and seismic and disabled access 
upgrades that need to be made to 
the building. 

Meanwhile, another landmark 
Castro bar, the Castro Station, is 
scheduled to re-open by mid-De¬ 


cember as “The Bar on Castro.” 

Its new owners, Greg Bron- 
stein and Morgan Gorrono, tell 
the B.A.R. they are remodeling it 
into a more upscale “bar-lounge.” 

They expect it will be a very 
popular and relaxed alternative in 
the Castro. 

Bronstein recently purchased 
another landmark Castro busi¬ 
ness, Pozole Cafe, on Market 
Street. 

Castro Station had been in 
business on Castro Street for 
more than 20 years. 

Its last night was Halloween. ▼

Mora ordered to stand 
trial for murder in 
Wilmes death 


by Cynthia Laird 


0 1 an Francisco Municipal 
Court Judge Ellen Chaitin 
% P on Tuesday, November 24 
ordered Edgard Mora to stand 
trial for murder in the death of 
gay city resident Brian Wilmes. 
Chaitin also reduced a felony 
charge of assault against a witness 
to a misdemeanor, and set bail at 
$650,000 over the objections of 
Assistant District Attorney Mur- 
lene Randle. Mora’s defense attor¬ 
ney, Robert Dunlap argued for 
$20,000 bail. 

The murder charge carries a 
hate crime enhancement. 

Mora, 26, was ordered back to 
court on December 10 and was 
returned to jail following his brief 
court appearance. He has pleaded 
not guilty to the charges. 

In issuing her ruling, Chaitin 
“cited last week’s preliminary hear¬ 


ing testimony by Wilmes’s friend 
Timothy Carroll, who told the 
court Mora was shaking Wilmes 
after throwing a single punch that 
knocked him to the ground out¬ 
side of the Loading Dock, a gay 
bar on Mission Street, on March 
12. Wilmes, 45, died of head in¬ 
juries two days later. Carroll also 
testified last week that Mora ut¬ 
tered anti-gay epithets four times 
during the attack, which occurred 
as Wilmes and Carroll attempted 
to go into the bar. 

Chaitin said Carroll’s testimo¬ 
ny about the shaking showed 
there was “sufficient implied mal¬ 
ice” to make Mora stand trial on 
the murder charge. 

Other witnesses, including 
Mora’s girlfriend Silvia Vanegas, 
testified during last week’s hearing 
they did not see Mora shake 
Wilmes. However, Vanegas also 
testified she didn’t see Mora 
punch Wilmes as she was in their 


Double murder update 


by Lois Pearlman 


§P ' riends of a controversial 
Russian River area gay bar 
M owner and his friend have 
offered a “substantial” reward for 
information leading to the arrest 
of whoever is responsible for their 
murder last month. 

“We are concerned for our com¬ 
munity that one amongst us has 
perpetrated this horrible act. We 
would like to see this person 
brought to justice,” said Bill Brown, 
a friend of 57-year-old homicide 
victim Hans Grahlmann. 

The group offering the reward, 


an unspecified amount of money, 
asks anyone with information 
about the murder to contact De¬ 
tective Russell Davidson of the 
Sonoma County Sheriff’s Depart¬ 
ment, at (707) 527-3992. 

Meanwhile, the refusal of po¬ 
lice to provide information on the 
progress of their investigation has 
led to the proliferation of rumors. 
One of the rumors that is actually 
true, according to a close friend of 
Grahlmann who asked to remain 
anonymous, is that Grahlmann 
believed he was being stalked. 

One thing police have con¬ 
firmed is that the killings do not 
appear to have been random. T

ACT UP/SF defector 
denies theft charges 


by Cynthia Laird 


• ormer ACT UP/San Fran¬ 
cisco member Chris Abbott, 
who was accused by fellow 
members in early September of 
absconding with $5,000 of the 
collective’s money to purchase 
medical marijuana, has told the 
Bay Area Reporter that he doesn’t 
look at what he did as stealing, 
and in an unsubstantiated coun¬ 
tercharge, claimed other members 
regularly helped themselves to 
hundreds or even thousands of 
dollars to pay rent and other liv¬ 
ing expenses. 

ACT UP/San Francisco front¬ 
man Michael Bellefountaine ve¬ 
hemently denied Abbott’s allega¬ 
tions and maintained the group’s 
financial records are open to any¬ 
one who wants to look at them. 
“Chris Abbott is a liar. It’s absurd 
I’d take money from anyone,” 
Bellefountaine told the Bay Area 
Reporter on Monday, November 
23. He said he’s well off financial¬ 
ly due to a lawsuit settlement and 
his family members. 

Abbott declined to reveal his 
whereabouts, fearing for his safe¬ 
ty, but in an interview Thursday, 
November 19, he said that he sim¬ 
ply got fed up with alleged verbal 
abuse from Bellefountaine and 
decided to leave town with some 
of the money after the drug deal 
he was to make went awry. 

“I don’t look at what I did as 
stealing. I went to make a deal,” 
Abbott told the B.A.R. “I went in 
with $4,000 and had a gun to my 
face and came out with half that. 
Half the money I gave to the 



Michael Bellefountaine 


homeless and the other half I lived 
on. I called to leave a voicemail 
and told them the deal went bad.” 

Within minutes of leaving the 
message, Abbott said, he began re¬ 
ceiving voicemail messages 
threatening his life. “They called 
my mother, who was dying and 
has since died,” said Abbott. 

Abbott returned to San Fran¬ 
cisco after the drug deal escapade, 
but left town, living for a time in 
Costa Rica before coming back to 
the United States. 

Bellefountaine said the group 
gave Abbott the $4,000 plus an¬ 
other $1,000 to secure medical 
marijuana. The fact that Abbott 
called the B.A.R. “signifies his 
conscious is bothering him. For 
him to call months later is lame 
and inexcusable,” Bellefountaine 
said, adding that anyone with 
knowledge of alleged impropri¬ 
eties against ACT UP/San Fran¬ 


cisco members can come forward. 

ACT UP/San Francisco is not 
affiliated with ACT UP/Golden 
Gate. Since the closure of Dennis 
Peron’s Cannabis Healing Center 
in May, ACT UP/San Francisco 
has become one of the few med¬ 
ical marijuana collectives that re¬ 
main open in the city. 

Abbott said other club mem¬ 
bers helped themselves to profits 
from medical marijuana sales at 
the group’s community space. “If I 
was to walk up to the till and took 
$60, I’d be called a thief. If 
Michael took $60, there was no 
questions. It’s a huge double stan¬ 
dard,” Abbott said. “I was verbally 
abused every single day. Some¬ 
thing degrading was said every¬ 
day.” 

Abbott said all eight of the 
members were supposed to be 
equal in the collective, but that it’s 
Bellefountaine who calls the 
shots. “Certain people take ... 
sometimes thousands of dollars,” 
he said. “I’d see it happen every¬ 
day.” 

Bellefountaine said ACT 
UP/San Francisco has never hid¬ 
den how much money they re¬ 
ceive from medical marijuana 
sales and said the fact the group is 
so open poses a certain amount of 
risk to them in terms of continu¬ 
ing to sell medical marijuana 
when the state and federal gov¬ 
ernment are actively seeking to 
close all such clubs. “In the month 
of September we made $108,000 
and spent $110,000. We’ve never 
hidden that. We’ve had a respon¬ 
sibility to the community from 
the beginning,” said Bellefoun¬ 
taine. T

Give, thanks 


ow thankful are you this Thanksgiv- 

: || ing? Are you fully appreciative that 
:• the elections earlier this month may 
have signaled that things are getting better, 
gradually, for people who aren’t heterosex¬ 
ual conservatives? Are you grateful that this 
World AIDS Day on Tuesday will be wit¬ 
nessed by people who were expected to die 
of HIV infection years ago? Are you glad¬ 
dened by the American public’s outrage at 
the death of Matthew Shepard? We are, and 
you are cordially invited to join us as we 
revel in the feeling of appreciation this 
Thanksgiving. 

But (yes, we’re “but” freaks here) we in¬ 
tend to use the measure of our thanks as a 
kind of yardstick against the yet-untraveled 
distance that looms before us. All of the 
things we mentioned are good omens of 
things that may occur in the future, but for 
now they are only portents, and without a 
lot more hard work they will evaporate like 
mirages. 

So here at Thanksgiving, the traditional 
time for Americans to sit down and cele¬ 
brate harvests, we would like to venerate 
this latest crop of good news, and focus on 
sowing what we hope to reap in the future. 
And we encourage others to bow their 
heads for a minute here and consider what 
they will sow, and how. The pilgrims who 
gathered for this holiday with their indige¬ 
nous neighbors (before they took to slaugh¬ 
tering them) didn’t say, “Thank God that’s 
over with and we never have to go through 
that again.” 

They knew, as we should, that the work 
of survival never really ends. So let’s get 
moving on these things, together. 

Ending anti-gay violence, for example, 
may seem like an impossible dream, but 
consider this: there was a time when it was 
not uncommon for left-handers to be 
burned as heretics, until education replaced 
superstition about why those people were 
different. Only by educating others about us 
can we ensure that people will consider the 
persecution of homosexuals just as ignorant 
and horrid as burning left-handers Some 
people do that kind of educating best in 
small groups; some in larger forums. Some 
are bulldozers and some are bridge builders. 
But all hands and talents will be needed to 


reap this important harvest, and everyone 
should feel suffused with that work ethic - 
particularly as we move closer to that goal. 

Similarly, if we want an end to AIDS, 
with people with HIV able to live full 
healthy lives with drug treatments 
that are less expensive, more pre¬ 
cise, less prone to side effects, and , 
more convenient, we need to 
work together. Take the time to 
write DuPont Pharmaceuticals and 
denounce the company’s price-gouging 
for its new drug, if that’s the way you 
feel you can be most helpful; 
but if that isn’t your style, find 
other ways of helping to ame¬ 
liorate the epidemic. Donate 
time or money, or.help in creative ways that 
will astound your friends and improve your 
world. 

And, of course, the eviction of reac¬ 
tionary Republicans from Congress must 
continue. There is much more to be done 
on the domestic front in this country that 


has yet to distribute to its poor (including 
the exhausted and demoralized working 
poor) any of the peace dividend that we 
should be sharing nine years after the Cold 
War’s end, or any of the prosperity dividend 
from this sustained “recovery.” If we 
want that to happen, and for society 
to extend that kind of fairness into all 
area of life, we have to start working 
now. 

Finally, as long as we are in a thank¬ 
ful mood (and no jokes about turkeys, 
please) we’d like to give thanks for 
our longest-continuing con¬ 
tributor, Dick Walters, better 
known as Sweetlips. The annu¬ 
al Sweetlips birthday bash is set 
for this Sunday, November 29, at the Ren¬ 
dezvous (1303 Polk Street), and if past fetes 
are any indication, it will be an afternoon to 
remember. Personally, we intend to ask him 
about that first Thanksgiving, at which, ac¬ 
cording to lore, he disgraced himself dread¬ 
fully. See you there. T 




Grading our schools 


by Laura McAlpine, LCSW, Policy 
director, Illinois Caucus for 
Adolescent Health 


£ | atthew Shepard was a young gay 
man whose murder reflects the vi- 

- I olence, both physical and verbal, 
that affects gay youth every day. To address 
anti-gay violence, we should examine not 
just its most extreme forms, but we must 
look at the places that allow it to grow and 
flourish. 

Most young people spend much of their 
time every day in schools - Shepard was a 
college student himself. Alarmingly, recent 
studies show that gay, lesbian, bisexual, and 
transgendered (GLBT) youth are five times 
more likely to miss school because of feeling 
unsafe and four times more likely to have 
been threatened with a weapon at school. A 
Des Moines, Iowa survey estimates that all 
youth in school hear sexual orientation 
slurs 26 times a day. GLBT youth are phys¬ 
ically, verbally, an4 emotionally abused in¬ 
side schools on a daily basis and the adults 
in charge of the schools are not protecting 
them. 

Studies also tell us that while GLBT 
youth identified by their peers as gay or les¬ 
bian are at highest risk for health problems, 
heterosexual youth incorrectly targeted by 
their peers as gay or lesbian are second, fol¬ 
lowed by closeted gay kids, and lastly, 
straight youth whose sexual orientation is 
not questioned. In classroom focus groups 
across the state conducted by the Illinois 
Caucus for Adolescent Health, young peo¬ 
ple report that their schools are not safe 
places for GLBT youth and have expressed 
concern about the violence and ridicule that 


they witness by other youth and school per¬ 
sonnel, including coaches, security guards, 
and support staff. 

Intolerance and violence due to sexual 
orientation affects all young people regard¬ 
less of their sexual orientation, not just be¬ 
cause they themselves may be targeted by 
homophobia, but because all young people 
are at a stage in life when they form a sexu¬ 
al orientation identity. This normal devel¬ 
opmental stage of exploring and ques¬ 
tioning one’s sexual identity can be 
fraught with fear, repression, and vi¬ 
olence. 

How can we help young people 
move from childhood to adult¬ 
hood safely and with dignity and 
respect for their sexual orientation? 

We can start by asking the schools 
in our communities how 
they keep all young peo¬ 
ple safe, and how they 
teach them about toler¬ 
ance of others based on differences - 
whether the differences are race, income, 
gender, ability, or sexual orientation. If you 
are in school, go to your head administrator 
and ask these questions. If you are a parent, 
go to your child’s school and talk to your 
child’s teacher, the principal, the local 
school council, and the Parent Teacher As¬ 
sociation. Go to the school in your neigh¬ 
borhood. Call your local chapter of the Gay, 
Lesbian and Straight Education Network. 
Call Parents and Friends of Lesbians and 
Gays. Show your school a copy of the Mass¬ 
achusetts Safe Schools Program for Gay and 
Lesbian Students. Find the resources in your 
community. 

And then find GLBT youth and ask them 
how you can help. The GLBT young people 


we work with at the caucus tell us that the 
gay and lesbian adult community does not 
reach out to them, and in fact avoids them 
for fear of being accused of recruiting or 
being sexual predators. These young people 
want adults as mentors, friends, and advo¬ 
cates. While anti-gay violence happens to 
people young and old, male and female, 
GLBT and straight, young people bear the 
brunt of the violence at a critical develop¬ 
mental stage. Without the support of adults 
they will continue to have disproportion¬ 
ately high health risks, including a suicide 
rate for GLBT youth three times that for 
heterosexual youth. 

My daughter is seven years 
old, and my partner and I are 
lesbians. I have gone to her pre¬ 
school, kindergarten, and first- 
grade teachers and ad¬ 
ministrators and asked 
them how they will keep 
her safe, how they will 
support children with lesbian and gay fam¬ 
ilies, how they will keep GLBT youth safe, 
how they will teach tolerance, and how they 
will help young people come to understand 
their sexual orientation without repression 
and violence. On the morning when I 
heard that Matthew Shepard died, I 
watched my daughter happily run to greet 
her friends on the playground at her 
school. I wondered when the harassment 
by her peers would start because she has 
two moms. Third grade? Sixth grade? We 
must act together to end all forms of intol¬ 
erance, and we can start by getting involved 
in schools where young children come with 
open minds and hearts, but too often grad¬ 
uate with bias and prejudice narrowing 
their world view. ▼

Super (nearly) thanks 

I’m writing to thank the 17,233 voters who voted 
for me and to applaud the efforts of the other 16 can¬ 
didates for the Board of Supervisors who had the 
leadership and courage of their convictions to put 
their ideas on the line - especially the other gay, les¬ 
bian, and transgendered candidates. With Bill “I’m a 
liar” Clinton and Willie “dictator” Brown in office it’s 
even more critical that visionary, ethical, and honest 
leadership similar to that of the late Harvey Milk 
emerge to give us all hope for a better future. Thanks 
again to everyone who helped on my $250 campaign. 

Shawn O'Hearn

Fong sway? 

Now that Matt Fong has distinguished himself by 
becoming the first politician in world history to sign 
a written affirmation of the civil rights of lesbians and 
gay men, what specific actions will he take to fulfill 
his obligation? Perhaps he can start by informing his 
client, damnation preacher Lou Sheldon that hate is 
not a family value. 

John Frederic Millen 
San Francisco 

[Point of order: We believe Fong may be the first 
GOP politician to sign such an affirmation, but not the 
first politician in world history.] 

Gloomy, overcast Friday 

Wayne Friday is beginning to sound 
like a rejected lover. I don’t find that the 
recent election confirms Friday’s judg¬ 
ment that Clinton “has been a disaster” 
for the party. Many ordinary folks I met 
when I was walking precincts voiced 
their support of the president. And 
what happened to Friday’s prediction 
that the president would resign within weeks? 

President Clinton has clearly been the most gay- 
friendly of our presidents. We can thank him for that; 
he has plenty of detractors among our enemies. Clin¬ 
ton was not exactly an unknown quantity when he 
was elected to his second term. Perhaps Friday could 
do us all a favor and find a new tune to hum. 

James Queen

[Editors note: It is a new tune, although it’s difficult 
to hear it through that mouthful of crow feathers.] 

Modest achiever 

I’m writing on behalf of myself, my organization, 
and Maria Gil de Lamadrid, who appeared in the Bay 
Area Reporter on November 12 as winner of the 1998 
MS Achievement Award. I cannot express how 
pleased we were with the story’s prominence in your 
paper. Maria truly is a remarkable individual and de¬ 
serves the attention that the award has brought her. 

She is modest, as you noted in the article, and I 
know she was surprised and touched by the story. 
Personally, I cut a caper similar to the one Tom Am- 
miano was doing at the top of the page. 

Terence Keane

Worse than death 

Thank you for your article “‘Til death do us part? 
State retirement system difficult for gays” [October 
29]. Actually it’s worse than “til death do us part” for 
pre-1990 options. The member’s monthly deductions 
don’t even stop if the beneficiary dies and no one will 
ever benefit! 

Assemblywoman Carole Migden’s expressed in¬ 
terest in the problem is most encouraging in view of 
bringing about a means of relief from the lifetime 
contracts. 

Thank you again for publishing the article. You 
should be complimented many times for your con¬ 
cern.

Seats of controversy 

[The following was sent to the Castro Theater:] 

How is it that the Castro Theater, which last year 
the Chronicle listed as one of the city’s few successful 
single-screen movie theaters, can’t afford to install 
new seats? The seats at your theater are old, worn-out, 
and damn uncomfortable. Twenty minutes into a film 
at the Castro and I need a smear of Preparation H and 
a back brace. 

And now you’re preparing to show the revised ver¬ 
sion of Bertolucci’s The Last Emperor, which runs 220 
minutes. Good grief! You won’t see my ass at that one! 

John H. Zaugg 

San Francisco 


Defense railing 

I am disgusted to find out that Matthew Shepard 
had his head bashed in with a hand gun, was strapped 
across fence railing, and left out to die. I understand 
that coyotes are killed and strapped across fence rail¬ 
ing to keep “other coyotes” out of the area. 

Colorado! ... Tsk! ... The homophobic state that 
passed anti-gay legislation by a 52 percent majority 
and is headquarters for a branch of the Christian 
“Reich” in Colorado Springs. ... Why am I not sur¬ 
prised? 

The Christian “Reich” homophobes are once again 
trying to use the defense that the killers experienced 
“homosexual panic,” that torturing and killing Shep¬ 
ard was somehow inevitable because he supposedly 
had flirted with them. Well... hello ... if you go into 
a homosexual environment and know someone is a 
homosexual... who is the predator?? 

This was a well planned killing. The killers lured 
him out by pretending to be gay, then beat, tortured, 
and killed him. Their punishment should be nothing 
less then to be beaten, skinned, and left out on fence 
railing to ward-off other homophobes. 

This killing should be a call to arms for all gay and 
lesbian people in America. We have been complacent 
far too long. We need to physically protect ourselves 
from the evil influences of the Christian “Reich,” 
white supremacists, and the GOP conservative right 
agenda led by Senator Lott and his cronies. Matthew- 
like killings will only increase under the hate speech 
of these insane, out of touch, ignorant, intol¬ 
erant religious bigots. 

It is now time for all gay and lesbian 
Americans to enroll in self-defense and 
martial arts classes. Purchase pepper 
spray and use it. Learn how to use a hand 
gun and get special permission to carry 
a concealed weapon from our chief of 
police. We are an endangered minority 
group. We will have the right to do so! 

If you feel you will be attacked by ho¬ 
mophobes, use your weapon against your attackers. 
Shoot first; ask questions later. If you kill it will be in 
self-defense. Protect yourselves! The most precious 
life is your own. We need to protect our right to live. 
The most precious gift that God gave us is our life ... 
ask any “Operation Rescue” fanatic! 

The hypocrites at the “Right to Life” campaign 
won’t speak out against the violence of gay-bashing. 
The hypocrites in our Congress are openly hostile to¬ 
wards gay and lesbian people ... not even a dignified 
homosexual person like Jim Hormel can get appoint¬ 
ed to an ambassadorship because he is gay. 

The hypocritical Archbishop of the San Francisco 
Roman Catholic Diocese who was so vocal against 
“domestic partnership” benefits has not said a word 
about violence against gay and lesbian people ... he 
doesn’t even acknowledge our presence in his church¬ 
es. Let’s not forget the Pope, who never once men¬ 
tioned that homosexuals were also targeted and killed 
by the Nazis during the “Shoah.” 

No, my fellow gay and lesbian brothers and sisters 
...we are on our own!! We have got nothing to lo 

se! Let’s get off our battered, low self-esteem asses 
and reclaim the respect and dignity of being human. 
The right to live our lives the way we were made to 
be. Get a weapon ... and use it! Become a Homosex¬ 
ual Army in defense of your life 

I will not be surprised by some letters to the edi¬ 
tor in response to my call to arms. Some will say I’m 
way over the edge. Others will say “Forget violence, 
we will vote those bastards out who speak disparag¬ 
ingly against us.” Some will say “this is an isolated in¬ 
cident.” You will all be in denial of the truth. 

We gay and lesbians are a targeted group. What’s 
real scary about what I’m suggesting is that I am per¬ 
fectly logical, calm in my convictions, and ready. 
Frankly, I’ve had it! I will strike out and kill anyone 
who threatens to take my life, a friend or family mem¬ 
ber’s life. Get a weapon ... stay vigilant... stay alive! 

Charles Franco 
San Francisco 

[Calm, perhaps, but not logical. Nobody can (or 
should) argue that shooting strangers on the basis of fear 
is true self-defense. Take a self-defense class; take a time¬ 
out; take a Xanax if necessary, but don’t perpetuate vi¬ 
olence in Matthew Shepard’s name.] 

Passes and failures 

I wonder how many straight men would be alive 
today if the gals gunned down every guy who made 
an unwanted pass at them? Fifty? Five? The Pope and 
Fabio? (And the Pope wasn’t always a priest). 

Women have actually made passes at me and lived 
to tell about it. 

I suspect if these jerks in Wyoming ever had a 
choice between a blow job and the death penalty 
again they’d take the blow job. 

But that’s the big difference between two gay guys 
and two straight guys. With the straight guys you can’t 
suck both their dicks ... at the same time.

And the story of the moral is ... 

I read the letters by John Schank and Armand 
Boulay [“Morality is relative, naturallyand “Ban the 
Taliban mentality,” October 15] that responded to my 
letter [“Morality isn’t relative,” September 23.]. I then 
reviewed my original letter. What we have here is a 
failure to communicate. I’m not sure who Schank is 
referring to when he says “we apparently want to de¬ 
stroy a president.” Couldn’t be me. In my letter, I 
wrote “‘accepting responsibility,’ as I understand it 
means accepting the consequences of your misdeeds.” 
I see nothing in the letter about “destroying” anyone, 
unless, John thinks that atonement is fatal (I believe 
in AA, atonement is the eighth step). As far as lying, 
Clinton has lied about the draft, smoking marijuana, 
the Gennifer Flowers affair, etc. I’d call this a pretty 
clear psychological pattern. 

I addressed truthfulness and the recognition of the 
difference between privacy and secrecy. Harriet Gold- 
hor Lerner, psychologist and author of The Dance of 
Deception, defines privacy as the keeping of personal 
thoughts and beliefs to oneself; secrecy is hiding ac¬ 
tions or deeds that would lower your esteem in oth¬ 
ers’ eyes, thereby preventing them from making an in¬ 
formed decision about staying connected to you. 
Clinton’s lack of integrity is obvious using this defin¬ 
ition: Do you advocate the “well-the-Republicans-did- 
wrong-so-the-Democrats-are-entitled” strategy? 

Matthew Shepard’s alleged killers are an example 
of “relative morality” at work. Relative morality en¬ 
courages racism, repression, gay bashing, etc. by plac¬ 
ing ethics on a “sliding scale.” Without a fixed code of 
ethics, one can justify any wrongdoing. 

I suggested Clinton face the consequences; not 
that he accept impeachment, but you inferred that 
anyway. Your issue. And what disturbs you so much 
that you term my letter “negative?” It offers provoca¬ 
tive but intelligent criticisms. Criticism precedes 
change. The civil rights movement began with criti¬ 
cism. Was Martin Luther King “negative?” Malcolm 
X? Words can be used to anger and enlighten simul¬ 
taneously, as Jesus, Mohammed, and Ghandi know. 
An open mind will question before it rejects. 

On the McKinney issue, we must have read differ¬ 
ent accounts of the trial. He was convicted of at¬ 
tempting to obstruct justice (in other words, hiding 
the facts; exactly like Clinton). Nonetheless, I think, 
perhaps the subtleties of racism elude you. I cannot 
address that myself. There is, however, the Implicit At¬ 
titude Test created by the University of Washington 
and Yale University scientists that tests inherent (un¬ 
conscious) racism. Take it at http://.depts.washing- 
ton.edu/iat. CBS Evening News recently covered this 
story. Many of us who take it (including black peo¬ 
ple) are likely to find we are more racist than they 
allow themselves to acknowledge. It’s enlightening. 

By the way, the most recent Field poll shows that 
“public” support is perceptibly shifting away from 
Clinton. Field predicted this months ago. He knows, as 
do psychologists, that critical faculties freeze in the 
face of shocking revelations and painful disclo¬ 
sures/disappointments, but return over extended time. 
He is the expert on public attitudes. So, Armand, your 
statement about my “expressing dismay over those 
who overwhelmingly support the president” may need 
revision. I spoke to your letter, which spoke of “lying 
politicians.” Yet now, you “overwhelmingly support 
our president?” And did you not compare Clinton’s af¬ 
fair as not being “any worse than” Thomas Jefferson’s 
slave-master relationship? Could you possibly make a 
more telling statement about slavery or about rela¬ 
tionships between people in unequal positions of 
power? Recently, the Reverend Bell, a well-known 
black minister, said about Clinton that people confuse 
“forgiveness” and “reconciliation.” Forgiveness, he 
says, is a start, but he adds that Clinton must take steps 
to atone and rebuild the trust that he destroyed by be¬ 
traying his friends, family, advisors et al. 

And, regardless of what black leaders are saying, 
the poverty level for black families and teenagers in 
America has increased by .6 percent in the past two 
years. Progress?! For whom?? As for Lani Guinier, you 
miss the point by the proverbial country mile, Ar¬ 
mand. Is casting aspersions on Guinier’s profession¬ 
al integrity and then destroying their “friendship” a 
comment on Guinier’s “qualifications?” Have you 
read her book The Tyranny of the Majority ? It suggests 
methods for increasing minority voices in voting, not 
quotas! Guinier recently stated that she hasn’t heard 
from or spoken to Clinton since he withdrew her 
nomination. Betraying a (true) friend is, in my book, 
never acceptable. I am aligned to the Reverend King’s 
belief: judge a man by the content of his character. 

Finally, Meg Greenfield of Newsweek, in her Octo¬ 
ber 13 column stated, with respect to Clinton’s cred¬ 
ibility, that he “has already lost.” Isn’t that what I said? 

I will admit one thing: you both forced me to re¬ 
examine what I was saying. I think it’s more correct to 
say that social ‘mores’ are relative to society and the 
individual. Morality (i.e. ethics) hasn’t changed much 
over time. Still, I couldn’t agree less with what you 
consider acceptable conduct. And never will. What we 
have here is a failure to communicate.

In praise of caregivers ... 

Imagine an industry with 95 million employees 
working in almost every city in the country. It would 
employ more people than the U.S. government, more 
than the “Big Three” automakers, the computer soft¬ 
ware industry, or the oil industry. 

It may surprise you to learn that there is such an 
industry, but the workers don’t get paid - at least not 
in money. And the product they give is love, skilled 
care, time, and energy to a loved one who is disabled 
from illness or age. 

A United Hospital Fund study made a conserva¬ 
tive estimate of the economic value of private care¬ 
giving in America. Their answer was: 25.5 million 
caregivers working an average of 17.9 hours a week 
for an hourly wage of $8.18 an hour provided $194 
billion to the U.S. economy. 

To put that figure in perspective, nationwide ex¬ 
penditures for all paid home health care in 1996 was 
$30 billion, and $79 billion for the entire nursing 
home industry. 

It is especially appropriate to celebrate National 
Family Caregivers Week, November 22-28, the week 
of Thanksgiving. In this week when we celebrate to¬ 
gether as friends and families, let’s also thank the 25 
million family caregivers who give more than money 
can buy to their loved ones - because they care. Our 
theme for 1998 is “Share the Caring”. 

Home Care Companions is a nonprofit program 
that has been providing training and support free of 
charge for family caregivers for over ten years. These 
classes are ongoing in the community and we en¬ 
courage people who are caring for someone to con¬ 
tact us for further information at (415) 563-9286. 

I’d like your readers to think about their extended 
family and circle of friends and co-workers. They will 
probably think of several who take care of a chroni¬ 
cally ill or infirm spouse, child or parent. Then I’d like 
to ask them to take the time to acknowledge the chal¬ 
lenges the caregiver willingly carries, out of love, and 
offer to share the caring just a little bit.

Taking a Denny out of denigration 

We at the Denny’s at Fisherman’s Wharf have been 
taking a lot of flak about the corporate Denny’s prob¬ 
lem (i.e., racism, homophobia, etc.). We are perceived 
as the same sort of people, merely because of the 
name, and no consideration is given to us as we are 
locally owned and have the most diversified restau¬ 
rant in the city, hiring all ethnic backgrounds and 
treating all of our customers in a fair manner. 

Most recently we had our annual Halloween cos¬ 
tume contest this year, raising money for AIDS. Just 
thought people might want to know.

Protect people, not trademarks 

The following is an open letter to Elizabeth Birch, 
executive director, Human Rights Campaign: 

I was astounded by the piece in Fall ’98 HRC 
Quarterly regarding trademarking the HRC logo. Had 
not the Supreme Court upheld the right of the U.S. 
Olympic Committee to regulate use of the word 
“Olympics,” I would have thought your trademark 
protection of an equality symbol in gold on blue out 
of order. 

Nevertheless, HRC’s exhortation to report in¬ 
stances of your logo’s “appearing on some other 
group’s work or showing up somewhere in the wrong 
colors or dimensions” leaves me baffled. What action 
by your organization may I anticipate if, for example, 
this logo should show up in red and white in the 
“right” dimensions? Might you also be worried that 
students of mathematical texts will flood you with in¬ 
stances of its showing up in various dimensions in 
black and white? 

Can you really think that trademarking your logo 
will advance the human rights espoused by HRC? 1 
doubt that HRC would even exist had the rainbow 
flag been trademarked by its creator or by the San 
Francisco Gay Freedom Day Committee 20 years ago. 

Should I encounter what I suspect you’re looking 
for, I will send a copy to the U.S. Olympic Committee.

26 November 1998 BAY AREA REPORTER 9 



Watt’s up in the GOP? 


by Wayne Friday 


ouse Republicans last week 
chose Louisiana Represen¬ 
tative Bob Livingston as 
the new House speaker, Represen¬ 
tative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma as 
the new chair of the Republican 
Conference (the number four 
GOP House leadership post), and 
Virginia Representative Tom 
Davis as head of the GOP’s Na¬ 
tional Campaign Committee, ap¬ 
parently hoping that they would 
be seen as a “new, galvanized, 
more centrist” leadership team. 
Hardly so, however. 



Representative J.C. Watts 


Since someone had to take the 
blame for the party’s stinging 
midterm losses. Newt Gingrich 
got booted for unilaterally decid¬ 
ing to run those ill-fated anti- 
Clinton sex-scandal television ads 
the final two weeks of the cam¬ 
paign, and for having publicly 
promised only weeks before the 
November 3 elections that “I’ll 
never again make a campaign 
speech without mentioning the 
Monica [Lewinsky, as if you did¬ 
n’t know] issue.” Those two deci¬ 
sions broke the back of the Re¬ 
publican party and helped them 
lose five House seats to the De¬ 
mocrats. Still, the “new leader¬ 
ship” group that the Republicans 
chose last week still looks very 
much like the “gang of Newt.” 
First, they voted to keep Repre¬ 
sentative Dick Armey (Texas), 
who has made more than his 
share of anti-gay comments on 
the House floor (among them: re¬ 
ferring to Representative Barney 
Frank as “Barney Fag”) and re¬ 
elected Representative Tom 
DeLay of Texas, another pro¬ 
claimed enemy of the gay com¬ 
munity, as its powerful minority 
whip. 

Although most Washington 
Republicans would like us to see 
the speaker-elect as a moderate 
with a more “compassionate con¬ 
servative” style than Gingrich, 
Livingston’s record shows other¬ 
wise. The political views of Liv¬ 
ingston, Armey, Davis, and, yes, 
even Watts are precisely those of 
the deposed Gingrich, U.S. Senate 
Majority Leader, Trent Lott (who 
was also retained last week), and 
the national chair of the Republi¬ 
can Party, a man the GOP seems 
determined to retain when the 
Republican National Committee 
meets in a few weeks. 

As for Watts, the only African- 
American Republican in the 
House, who regularly gets re¬ 
elected in a district that is 80 per¬ 
cent white outside Oklahoma 
City, he can hardly be called a 


“moderate,” no matter what his 
race is. An ordained Baptist min¬ 
ister, he is avidly anti-abortion, 
does not support gay rights, extols 
the Republican ideals of self-re¬ 
liance and “responsible morality” 
and once referred to other black 
politicians (apparently referring 
to the Reverend Jesse Jackson, 
among others) as “race-baiting 
poverty pimps whose careers 
hinge on keeping black people de¬ 
pendent on government.” Watts 
surely is an attractive face, but his 
record is perfectly in step with the 
GOP House leadership and his 
appointment is political window- 
dressing at most. 

Nope, no “new ideas” for the 
Republicans, despite their dismal 
showing on November 3. We can 
still expect to see Armey (in 
particular), speaker-to- 
be Livingston (eventual¬ 
ly), and even Watts (like¬ 
ly), railing on television 
against the “sin” of ho¬ 
mosexuality, backing 
up Lott’s homopho¬ 
bic views. 

Look also 
for them to 
continue to 
proclaim that 
there is no “middle ground” on 
the abortion issue - and even less 
room in the Republican Party for 
those who think there is. They 
aren’t likely to soon learn that it 
was precisely issues like abortion 
and gay-bashing that helped their 
party lose some key races Novem¬ 
ber 3. There are no indications 
from the new GOP leadership 
that things will be any different as 
they prepare for the 2000 elec¬ 
tions, even though kissing up to 
the religious right spelled doom 
for most of those candidates who 
so proudly wore the endorsement 
of anti-gay and anti-abortion 
leaders like Gary Bauer and 
Ralph Reed. A look at election 
results clearly shows that the sup¬ 
port of the high-profile religious 
right couldn’t even win in the 
deep South, much less on the 
coasts. In New York and in Cali¬ 
fornia, Chuck Schumer and 
Gray Davis successfully impaled 
Al D’Amato and Dan Lungren 
on their efforts to reverse Roe v. 
Wade. And it was, as we all now 
know, in California (a place the 
New York Times says is “always a 
snapshot of the political future”) 
that the campaign of Republican 
candidate Matt Fong’s (once well 
ahead in the race) went into a 
meltdown after it was revealed 
that he had given $50,000 to the 
homophobic Traditional Values 
Coalition. Republicans in Califor¬ 
nia by the score - who despise 
Barbara Boxer politically - 
ended up voting for her, rather 
than chance the two-faced Fong. 

Missouri U.S. Senator John 
Ashcroft, one of the Republican 
Party’s most anti-gay, anti-abor¬ 
tion conservatives (who is looking 
to Pat Robertson’s Christian 
Coalition, Lou Sheldon’s Tradi¬ 
tional Values Coalition, and other 
far right religious groups for sup¬ 
port as he seeks the GOP presi¬ 
dential nomination in 2000), 
campaigned endlessly for candi¬ 
dates in four top presidential pri¬ 
mary states this year - and all four 
lost. Even in Colorado, home to 
the anti-gay James Dobson’s 
Focus on thejamily, a supposed¬ 
ly slam-dunk ballot initiative out¬ 
lawing so-called “partial birth 
abortions” went down to defeat. 

Politics and people - 
Now if the Mabel Teng, 
Amos Brown, and Fong cam¬ 
paigns would kindly remove their 


ugly, tired campaign signs on Cas¬ 
tro, maybe the street could get 
back to looking halfway decent 
again - except, of course, for the 
increasing numbers of panhan¬ 
dlers there; at 10 a.m. Saturday 
morning there were four young 
men (all seemingly under the age 
of 20) sitting on the sidewalk di¬ 
rectly outside Walgreens, hitting 
up the passersby and the store’s 
customers - with another two 
doing the “spare change?” number 
directly around the corner on 
18th Street. Hey, if Mayor Willie 
Brown really wants to know why 
his job approval ratings are going 
south, those close to him must 
start emphasizing that this prob¬ 
lem is right up there with Muni as 
an issue that will spell big trouble 
for Brown as next 
year’s election ap¬ 
proaches. 

Even some of 
Brown’s supporters 
are privately admit¬ 
ting that the homeless 
problem is now worse 
than it was 
under former 
Mayor Frank 
Jordan, and 
the issue was 
even fodder for a front page story 
recently in the New York Times, 
which pointed out that “San Fran¬ 
cisco, the 13th largest city in the 
country, has the third highest 
population of the homeless, after 
only New York City and Los An¬ 
geles.” While everyone agrees that 
something has to be done to help 
the city’s homeless, the problem is 
only growing, and residents, mer¬ 
chants, and tourists alike will tell 
you they are getting increasingly 
fed up, and whether Brown likes 
it or not, they hold him responsi¬ 
ble. 

This Friday, November 27, 
marks the 20th anniversary of the 
murders of Mayor George 
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey 
Milk. Mayor Brown and city offi¬ 
cials remembered the contribu¬ 
tions of Moscone and Milk Tues¬ 
day at a commemorative service 
at the San Francisco Opera 
House; a memorial candlelight 
march will be held this Friday, be¬ 
ginning at 6:30 p.m. at Castro and 
19th streets honoring the late 
Harvey Milk, an icon who many 
now see as the father of the gay 
rights movement in San Francis¬ 
co and the late mayor, George 
Moscone, one of the best friends 
that our movement ever had, both 
in his personal life and as a gov¬ 
ernment official. 

Hope to see you there. T

n spring 1891 one Alice 

Mitchell of Memphis, Tenn., 

. proposed to one Freda Ward. 
In fact, she extended the offer in 
three separate letters, and Freda, 
called Fred, agreed to become 
Alice Mitchell’s wife. Alice gave 
Fred an engagement ring and the 
two planned their elopement. 

One hundred years later, in 
spring 1991, I wrote the above 
paragraph, paraphrased from 
Jonathan Katz’s Gay American 
History (Harper and Row, 1976) 
to kick off my first opinion piece 
for this paper. A few more com¬ 
mentaries later and I had earned 
myself a column under the head¬ 
ing “Dykeotomy,” which ran until 
the spring of 1995 when I felt as 
though I was running out of 
opinions, or at least repeating my¬ 
self too often, and that perhaps 
readers would enjoy hearing 
someone else’s two cents worth. 
There was also that other job, 
teaching high school English, that 
was competing for my time and 
energy. Well, I’m back, not sure 
what I’ll have to say this time 
around, but happy to be under 
my old banner “Dykeotomy.” 

I’ve always distrusted di¬ 
chotomies - male/female, 
black/white, good/evil, love/hate - 
because life is so often lived in the 
complexities of the inbetween, the 
muddle that is rich with gray. So, 
with “Dykeotomy” I hope to offer

something beyond polar oppo¬ 
sites, an answer not distilled to 
true or false. A party line of one, 
not dictated by either side of the 
aisle, sometimes two sides of the 
same coin, both sides of which 
can seem to have little gray mat¬ 
ter at times. 

So, how does one pick up 
where I left off more than three 
years ago? Maybe right where I 
started. 

Let’s return to the story of 
Alice and Freda. It turns out that 
things did not go well for out the 
pioneering dyke couple. Freda’s 
sister discovered the marriage 
plan and successfully interfered. 
Kept from the woman she loved, 
Alice grew desperate. Her frustra¬ 
tion festered and eventually, she 
killed her beloved Freda when she 
realized that their dream of being 
together had been shattered by 
others. 

I hope you can see why I chose 
this story as a backdrop to my 
opinion piece about the impor¬ 
tance of San Francisco’s then-new 
domestic partner’s ordinance. The 
sad tale gave me a chance to cele¬ 
brate how far we’ve come in 100 
years. I wanted to urge San Fran¬ 
ciscans to take advantage of regis¬ 
tration as a means of visibility for 
themselves and for those people 
around the country and around 
the world who have unbearable 
homophobstacles in the way of 
their love and their dreams. 

Now, almost eight years later, 
as we look toward the next centu¬ 
ry, I see that we can look forward 


to a statewide ballot measure in 
the year 2000 that would make 
legal only marriages between a 
man and a woman. Of course, 
Congress already did that dirty 
work with the Defense of Mar¬ 
riage Act, allowing states to ignore 
same-sex unions licensed in other 
states. In fact, 29 states have al¬ 
ready banned gay marriage, and 
thanks to state Senator Pete 
Knight (R-Palmdale) and the 
677,000 signers of his petition, we 
can vote to be the 30th state to 
ban gay marriage - or vote not to 
be number 30 in the bigot parade. 

Either way the voting goes, the 
ballot initiative is measure 
enough to know that the Alice 
and Freda of today are not in the 
clear yet. Or, as my best friend in 
high school used to say: “I guess 
it’s the same ... only different.” 

Ah, how rich are the con¬ 
tradyketions, those ideas that 
seem to cancel each other out, but 
really just point to the complexity 
of it all. It’s as if what is illogical 
on one level somehow holds true 
in some queer dimension. In my 
twilight zone, for instance, it’s true 
that gay men and lesbians are just 
like everyone else. Yet it’s also true 
that there’s something “other” 
about being queer in our culture. 
We’re the same, only different. We 
have the potential to be a com¬ 
munity, but not a monolith. We 
have commonalties and patterns, 
but we’re not all of the same cloth. 

Cruising back through my old 
clippings, I see myself writing

26 November 1998 BAY AREA REPORTER 11 




Greta and Marlene 
ride Mercedes 


by David Bianco 


1 found no surprises in the Kin¬ 
sey report,” actress Tallulah 

Bankhead reportedly said. 
Bankhead knew that some of the 
most glamorous stars of Hol¬ 
lywood’s golden age (from 
the advent of talking pic¬ 
tures through the 1940s), 
were part of an under¬ 
ground network of les¬ 
bians and bisexual women in 
the movie industry. 

Greta Garbo was 
one of the most fa¬ 
mous movie stars of 
her time, attracting 
both male and female audiences 
with her seductive beauty and 
enigmatic charm. Starting out in 
silent films, Garbo’s first talkie was 
Anna Christie (1930). Her deep, 
sexy voice and tough demeanor 
made her very first lines of dia¬ 
logue legendary - “Gimme a 
whisky, ginger ale on the side. And 
don’t be stingy, baby.” Garbo’s 
gender-bending role in Queen 
Christina (1933), in which she 
cross-dressed and kissed her fe¬ 
male co-star on the lips, has be¬ 
come a cult favorite among les¬ 
bians. 

“I shall die a bachelor,” Garbo- 
as-Christina vowed. Like the 
Swedish queen she played, Garbo 
never married, and although she 
had affairs with men, it was com¬ 
monly believed among Holly¬ 
wood insiders that she preferred 
women. After a much-publicized 
romance with leading man John 
Gilbert, Garbo fell for female 
screenwriter Mercedes de Acosta 
in 1931. Garbo later credited de 
Acosta with inspiring her portray¬ 
al of Queen Christina. The suave 
de Acosta had been in and out of 
the beds of the most respected 
stage actresses of the time, includ¬ 
ing Eva La Gallienne and 
Katharine Cornell. When Garbo 
dumped her, she quickly took up 
with Hollywood’s other husky¬ 
voiced sensation, Marlene Diet- 
rich. 

Like Garbo, Dietrich was fa¬ 
mous for her androgynous sex 
appeal and a screen persona that 
defied strict gender classification. 
While her characters fell in love 
with men, they were always in¬ 
credibly butch women. Studio 
publicists promoted Dietrich as 
“the woman even women can 
adore.” Such Dietrich classics as 
Morocco (1930) and Blonde Venus 
(1932), in which she donned a top 
hat and tux and sang in her 
throaty contralto, are particularly 
memorable to lesbian and gay 
viewers. 

Though she was married, Di¬ 
etrich’s relationship with her hus¬ 
band was long-distance and non¬ 
exclusive. He had a long-term 
mistress, and she had just about 
everyone else, including Maurice 
Chevalier, Yul Brynner, and jour¬ 
nalist Edward R. Murrow. But she 
also enjoyed a host of female 
lovers, like de Acosta and French 




novelist Colette. Rumors of Diet¬ 
rich’s lesbian relationships had lit¬ 
tle effect on her popularity or her 
career, which continued unabated 
into the 1960s. 

Dietrich didn’t seem to care 
what anyone thought about her 
love life, and Tallulah 
Bankhead was equally un¬ 
concerned about gossip. 
Bankhead’s one-liners 
about her own bisexuality 
have become famous in 
lesbian and gay culture. 
“Daddy always warned me 
about men and alco¬ 
hol,” she reputedly 
quipped, “but he 
never said a thing 
about women and cocaine.” 

Garbp, however, was uncom¬ 
fortable with public scrutiny. Ed¬ 
mund Goulding, the gay film¬ 
maker who directed Garbo in the 
classic Grand Hotel (1932), once 
implied that the star retired from 


movies in 1941 at the age of 36 
because the pressure of hiding her 
lesbianism became too great. 
Whatever her reasons, Garbo 
fiercely protected her privacy until 
her death in 1990, making her 
classic line from Grand Hotel , “I 
want to be alone,” a reality. 

Fifty years later, of course, not 
much has changed in Hollywood, 
where actresses still follow the 
same patterns of playing butch 
roles but keeping mum about 
their personal lives (Jodie Foster) 
to making the cachet of lesbian¬ 
ism part of their schtick (Madon¬ 
na). ▼

riday, November 20,11 p.m., 
Polk and Sutter: A gang of 
|| the locals hanging out at the 
Muni bus stop on the northeast 
corner of the intersection were 
encouraging their pit bull terrier 
to attack people who walked 
past them on the sidewalk. 

The dog didn’t attack, 
but the intent of the 
owner was there. 

After the dog owner 
finished a liter of beer 
at the bus stop, he 
threw the bottle 
toward the head of 
a homeless woman 
who frequents the 
area. Three units 
of the San Francisco 
Police Department (SFPD) ar¬ 
rived on the scene and went look¬ 
ing for the suspects. Sergeant 
Dempsy of the Northern station 
said, “This is new activity in this 
area and will not be tolerated. I 
have a few questions for the 
owner of the animal in question.” 


The car that patrols this area is on 
the lookout. In the meantime, an¬ 
imal control officers have been 
notified. Sergeant Choy of animal 
control states, “In a case like this, 
the owners will be cited and the 
animal will be taken into custody. 
This is extremely dangerous and 
this activity will be dealt with 
heavily.”

as he attempted to

Street. The bus 
was traveling 
westbound on 
Ellis, and as it 
turned onto Larkin, 
the pedestrian was struck and 
dragged several feet. The fire de¬ 
partment arrived and freed the 
man, who was treated and trans¬ 
ported to the San Francisco Gen¬ 
eral Hospital by paramedics. The 
street light on the corner of 
Larkin and Ellis was not function¬ 
ing properly at the time of the ac¬ 
cident. Report a non-working 
street light to the Department of 
Public Works right away.

Saturday, November 21, 11 
p.m., Polk and Green: Three men 
on foot approached and assaulted 
a man with what the victim 
claimed was a box cutter-type of 
a weapon. The victim was treated 
on the scene for a lacerated hand 
and police searched the area, but 
no suspects were found. Any knife 
used in the commission of a 
crime is considered a deadly 
weapon.

hair loss. 


PROPECIA is a medical breakthrough-the first pill that effectively 
treats male pattern hair loss on the vertex (at top of head) and anterior 
mid-scalp area. 

By all measures, the clinical results of PROPECIA in men are impressive:* 

• 83% maintained their hair based on hair count 
(vs. 28% with placebo). 

• 66% had Visible regrowth as rated by independent 
dermatologists (vs. 7% with placebo). 

• 80% were rated as improved by dinical doctors 
(vs. 47% with placebo). 

• Most men reported an increase in the amount of hair, 

a decrease in hair loss, and improvement in appearance. 

*Based on vertex studies at 24 months of men 
18 to 41 with mild to moderate hair loss. 

Scientists have recently discovered that men with male pattern hair loss 
have an increased level of DHT in their scalps. PROPECIA blocks the forma¬ 
tion of DHT and, in this way, appears to interrupt a key factor in the develop¬ 
ment of inherited male pattern hair loss in men. Importantly, PROPECIA 
helps grow natural hair-not just peach fuzz-and is as convenient to take as 
a vitamin: one pill a day. 

For men who want to maintain and even increase hair count, today is a 
most exciting day. Talk to your doctor.

Only a doctor can determine if PROPECIA is right for you. PROPECIA is 
for men only. Further, women who are or may potentially be pregnant 
must not use PROPECIA and should not handle crushed or broken tablets 
because of the risk of a specific kind of birth defect. (See accompanying 
Patient Information for details.) PROPECIA tablets are coated and will 
prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling. 

You may need to take PROPECIA daily for three months or more to see 
visible results. PROPECIA may not regrow all your hair. And if you stop using 
this product, you will gradually lose the hair you have gained. There is not 
sufficient evidence that PROPECIA works for recession at the temporal areas. 
If you haven't seen results after 12 months of using PROPECIA further 
treatment is unlikely to be of benefit. 

Like all prescription products, PROPECIA may cause side effects. A very 
small number of men experienced certain side effects, such as: less desire 
for sex, difficulty in achieving an erection, and a decrease in the amount of 
semen. Each of these side effects occurred in less than 2% of men. These side 
effects were reversible and went away in men who stopped taking PROPECIA 
They also disappeared in most men (58%) who continued taking PROPECIA

man, and how it so moved him. 
Sylvester, who died of AIDS-re- 
lated causes in 1986, left a lega¬ 
cy for this young writer, and 
others like him, and seeing him 
celebrated in this way is both 
groundbreaking and welcome. 

Vibe covers hip-hop culture, 
and at first glance may seem to 
be an unlikely publication to 
carry this piece, because of the 
macho culture associated with 
much of the music. In another 
article, the female trio Total is 
given significant coverage, in¬ 
cluding a lengthy discussion of 
controversy around their sexual 
orientation, some of which was 
generated by statements of the 
members of the trio. The re¬ 
porter states that in this indus¬ 
try, no one is “all the way” out, 
and for Total to even “toy” with 
same-sex attraction is risky ca¬ 
reer-wise. Obviously, it would 
be ideal if musicians could be 
out, and have it not be an issue, 
but Vibe's addressing the topic 
is a welcome “breaking of the 
silence” around hip-hop and 
homosexuality. 

A third piece on the contro¬ 
versy surrounding the new film 
The Siege features an extensive 
discussion of the history of film 
protests by groups and organi¬ 
zations concerned with fair 


portrayals of minorities, in¬ 
cluding comments from 
GLAAD’s Director of Commu¬ 
nity Relations Cathy Renna. 

Please thank Vibe for their 
December/January issue, which 
is an important and valuable 
step forward in making LGBT 
people more visible in an 
arena where they are 
often invisible and 
sometimes vilified.

Stupid software tricks 

In a current print advertise¬ 
ment for McAfee anti-virus 
computer software, one of the 
best-selling programs of its 
kind, the headline reads “It’s 
nice to know about something 
before it becomes a problem.” 
You see a minister, and two 
hands: one appears to be male, 
the other female, presumably at 
a marriage ceremony. A third 
hand holds a note reading 
“She’s a man!” 

Obviously, McAfee thinks 
that this is an amusing way to 


tout their anti-virus software as 
being so good, it “catches” 
problems before you could 
know about them. Unfortu¬ 
nately, it also demonstrates a 
clear-cut disregard for trans¬ 
gender people.

Judge Judy lays 
down the law 

On Wednesday, November 18 
Judge Judy Sheindlin of the 
highly rated syndicated program 
Judge Judy presided over a case 
between two lesbians who had 
been former lovers. Regina 
Gaeta accused her former girl¬ 
friend Erlinda Alarcon of using 
her name and driver’s license 
number on a traffic ticket. While 
the two argued their case, Judge 
Judy stuck to the issue at hand, 


seemingly never giving the 
plaintiff and defendant’s sexual 
orientation any thought. Her 
signature cut-to-the-chase, no 
nonsense style was consistently 
reserved for the facts of the case. 

Please thank Sheindlin and 
the producers of Judge Judy for 
handling this case responsibly, 
and not succumbing to a prob¬ 
lem that often plagues some 
syndicated programs: unneces¬ 
sarily playing up a sensational 
aspect in an attempt to secure 
ratings.

PROPECIA** is for 


Patient Information 
about PR0PECIA® 

(Pro-pee-sha) 

Generic name: finasteride 
(fin-AS-tur-eyed) 

by MEN ONLY. 


Please read this leaflet before you start taking PR0PECIA. Also, read the information included with PR0PECIA each time you 
renew your prescription, just in case anything has changed. Remember, this leaflet does not take the place of careful discussions with 
your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss PR0PECIA when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. 


What is PR0PECIA used for? 

PR0PECIA is used for the treatment of male pattern hair loss on the vertex and 
the anterior mid-scalp area. 

PR0PECIA is for use by MEN ONLY and should NOT be used by women or children. 

What is male pattern hair loss? 

Male pattern hair loss is a common condition in which men experience thinning 
of the hair on the scalp. Often, this results in a receding hairline and/or balding on 
the top of the head. These changes typically begin gradually in men in their 20s. 
Doctors believe male pattern hair loss is due to heredity and is dependent on 
hormonal effects. Doctors refer to this type of hair loss as androgenetic alopecia. 

Results of clinical studies: 

For 12 months, doctors studied over 1800 men aged 18 to 41 with mild to moder¬ 
ate amounts of ongoing hair loss. All men, whether receiving PR0PECIA or 
placebo (a pill containing no medication) were given a medicated shampoo 
(Neutrogena T/Gel®*** Shampoo). Of these men, approximately 1200 with hair 
loss at the top of the head were studied for an additional 12 months. In general, 
men who took PR0PECIA maintained or increased the number of visible scalp 
hairs and noticed improvement in their hair in the first year, with the effect main¬ 
tained in the second year. Hair counts in men who did not take PR0PECIA con¬ 
tinued to decrease. 

In one study, patients were questioned on the growth of body hair. PR0PECIA did 
not appear to affect hair in places other than the scalp. 

Wifi PROPECIA work for me? 

For most men, PR0PECIA increases the number of scalp hairs, helping to fill in 
thin or balding areas of the scalp. Men taking PR0PECIA noted a slowing of hair 
loss during two years of use. Although results will vary, generally you will not be 
able to grow back all of the hair you have lost. There is not sufficient evidence 
that PROPECIA works in the treatment of receding hairline in the temporal area 
on both sides of the head. 

Male pattern hair loss occurs gradually over time. On average, healthy hair 
grows only about half an inch each month. Therefore, it will take time to see 
any effect. 

You may need to take PR0PECIA daily for three months or more before you see 
a benefit from taking PR0PECIA. PR0PECIA can only work over the longterm if 
you continue taking it. If the drug has not worked for you in twelve months, further 
treatment is unlikely to be of benefit. If you stop taking PR0PECIA, you will likely 
lose the hair you have gained within 12 months of stopping treatment. You 
should discuss this with your doctor. 

How should I take PROPECIA? 

Follow your doctor's instructions. 

■ Take one tablet by mouth each day. 

■ You may take PROPECIA with or without food. 

■ If you forget to take PROPECIA, do not take an extra tablet. Just take the 
next tablet as usual. 

PROPECIA will not work faster or better if you take it more than once a day.

■ Women who are or may potentially be pregnant: 

- must not use PROPECIA 

- should not handle crushed or broken tablets of PROPECIA. 

If a woman who is pregnant with a male baby absorbs the active ingredient in 
PROPECIA, either by swallowing or through the skin, it may cause abnormalities 
of a male baby's sex organs. If a woman who is pregnant comes into contact 
with the active ingredient in PROPECIA, a doctor should be consulted. PROPECIA 
tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during 
normal handling, provided that the tablets are not broken or crushed. 

What are the possible side effects of PROPECIA? 

Like all prescription products, PROPECIA may cause side effects. In clinical studies, 
side effects from PROPECIA were uncommon and did not affect most men. A 
small number of men experienced certain sexual side effects. These men 
reported one or more of the following: less desire for sex; difficulty in achieving an 
erection; and, a decrease in the amount of semen. Each of these side effects 
occurred in less than 2% of men. These side effects went away in men who 
stopped taking PROPECIA. They also disappeared in most men who continued taking 
PROPECIA. 

The active ingredient in PROPECIA is also used by older men at a five-times 
higher dose to treat enlargement of the prostate. Some of these men reported 
other side effects, including problems with ejaculation, breast swelling and/or ten¬ 
derness and allergic reactions such as lip swelling and rash. In clinical studies with 
PROPECIA, these side effects occurred as often in men taking placebo as in those 
taking PROPECIA. 

Tell your doctor promptly about these or any other unusual effects. 

■ PROPECIA can affect a blood test called PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) 
for the screening of prostate cancer. If you have a PSA test done, you 
should tell your doctor that you are taking PROPECIA. 

Storage and handling. 

Keep PROPECIA in the original container and keep the container closed. Store 
it in a dry place at room temperature. PROPECIA tablets are coated and will 
prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling^provided 
that the tablets are not broken or crushed. 

Do not give your PROPECIA tablets to anyone .else. It has been prescribed only 
for you. Keep PROPECIA and all medications out of the reach of children. 

THIS LEAFLET PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF INFORMATION ABOUT PROPECIA. IF 
AFTER READING THIS LEAFLET YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR ARE NOT SURE 
ABOUT ANYTHING, ASK YOUR DOCTOR.

Plenty of events 
this World AIDS Day 



This was the touching scene in July at the National AIDS Memorial 
Grove, at a memorial for Stephen Daniel. The grove is holding one of 
many local World AIDS Day events this Tuesday, December 1. 


by Cynthia Laird 


his Tuesday, December 1, 
will mark the 11th annual 
i; observance of World AIDS 
Day, and as in previous years, 
many activities are planned in San 
Francisco and Oakland. There’s 
also the launch of a new website. 

World AIDS Day is the one day 
each year that the world sets aside 
to honor all the people whose 
lives have been touched by AIDS. 
It is a day of reflection and appre¬ 
ciation of those who have died, 
those who are fighting to survive, 
the caregivers, and those who are 
finding new treatments and cures. 
World AIDS Day is also an oppor¬ 
tunity for those who grieve with 
loss to find hope, remembrance, 
and renewal. 

AEF penny drive 

As it has for the past five years, 
the AIDS Emergency Fund’s 
“Every Penny Counts” campaign 
caps off a month of intensive 
fundraising when the pennies will 
be dropped off to AEF staff and 
volunteers on World AIDS Day at 
an event in Union Square that 
runs from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. 
While penny jars are at businesses 
throughout the year, AEF upped 
the visibility of the drive this 
month, getting lots of school chil¬ 
dren and businesses in on the ef¬ 
fort as they have in previous years. 

“Every Penny Counts” started 
at the Gate restaurant in 1987. Pa¬ 
tron David Slocombe and the late 
bartender Fred Skau decided to 
collect coins for AEF in a washed- 
out olive jar on the bar. It has 
since become the signature 
fundraising project of the organi¬ 
zation, which provides emergency 
financial assistance to people liv¬ 
ing with HIV and AIDS in San 
Francisco and several Bay Area 
counties. The penny project 
raised $161,000 in 1997 and more 
than $1.16 million since its incep¬ 
tion. 

Last year AEF distributed over 
$1.6 million in grants. The agency 
has only a few paid staff members, 
and no executive director, result¬ 
ing in very low administrative 
overhead costs. With new medical 
advances, people living with AIDS 
(PWA) are living longer, and are 
often in need of financial assis¬ 
tance. Many of these people have 
difficulty paying for basic living 
expenses such as rent, utility bills, 
or special medical treatment not 
covered by other groups. 

The premise of the penny 
campaign is simple: most people 
don’t want their pennies but feel 
it’s wrong to throw money in the 
trash. The coin collection jars, 


which are now at countless busi¬ 
nesses in the city and elsewhere, 
are an easy way for people to con¬ 
tribute. “I think it’s great that you 
do this,” is a common refrain AEF 
hears from supporters. 

For more information, call the 
pennies project coordinator at 
(415) 558-6985. 

AIDS grove celebration 

Perhaps no other place pays 
tribute to those who have died of 
HIV or complications from AIDS 
more, or more effectively, than the 
National AIDS Memorial Grove 
in Golden Gate Park. The grove is 
the first major living memorial 
dedicated to those whose lives 
have been touched by AIDS. On 
World AIDS Day, the National 
AIDS Memorial Grove will recog¬ 
nize its first-ever award recipient, 
Irene Smith, at a ceremony led by 
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, 
San Francisco Symphony conduc¬ 
tor Michael Tilson Thomas, ac¬ 
tress Judith Light, and author 
Armistead Maupin from 11 a.m. 
until 1 p.m. Interested members 
of the community are welcome to 
attend, organizers said. 

“The grove will hold this spe¬ 
cial event to honor all people 
whose lives have been touched by 
AIDS,” said Thom Weyand, exec¬ 
utive director. 

Weyand will be participating 
in the ceremony, along with Dr. 
Tom Coates, director of the AIDS 
Research Institute (ARI) at the 
University of California, San 


Francisco (UCSF), and the Glide 
Memorial Church Choir. 

Conceived in 1989, the grove 
was designed to help people 
touched by AIDS find solace, sol¬ 
idarity, and hope. The grove is a 
wooded basin historically known 
as de Laveaga Dell and is tended 
to by volunteers who take part in 
monthly workdays held through¬ 
out the year. 

The grove’s decision to honor 
someone came about because the 
organization wanted to recognize 
a person who has been a hero in 
daring for PWAs.“Over the last 16 
years, many worthy people in the 
Bay Area have been recognized for 
their work for those inflicted with 
AIDS,” Weyand said. “The Na¬ 
tional AIDS Memorial Grove 
wanted to identify a person who 
has been a valued community 
hero in the caring of those with 
AIDS.” 

Smith has been a massage vol¬ 
unteer for PWAs since 1982. She 
has been tireless in providing 
touch to those often shunned by 
friends and family from the fear 
of the disease. “I was lucky to pio¬ 
neer this work before I was taught 
fear,” said Smith. 

She began volunteering at the 
San Francisco Hospice in 1982 
and soon started helping at San 
Francisco General Hospital’s 
AIDS Unit. In 1984 the hospice 
asked her to train a team of mas¬ 
sage volunteers for PWAs. Due to 
the demand, the Service Through

■ New NIH research showed people taking CRIXIVAN in triple therapy 
lived longer and experienced fewer opportunistic infections. 

m Recent year-long research conducted by the National Institutes of Health (Protocol ACTG 320) studied over 
1,000 patients and confirmed results from another study. 

*The group of patients receiving CRIXIVAN along with 3TC and AZT achieved a reduction in deaths and 
AIDS-defining illnesses over those taking 3TC and AZT alone. This reduction was significant enough for the NIH 
to recommend the study be stopped, so that all participants could benefit from the findings. Because the study 
was ended early, there was insufficient data to determine the statistical impact of CRIXIVAN on survival. 


■ CRIXIVAN in triple therapy continues to hold serum viral load down 
below the limit of detection at the one year mark. 

* In a separate, ongoing landmark study, over 90% of the 31 patients receiving CRIXIVAN, AZT and 3TC reduced their 
HIV serum viral load below the limit of detection after 24 weeks (as measured by available tests; the virus may 
still be present in other organ systems). 

m Importantly, the limited number of patients who chose to stay with the study for longer periods of time maintained 
these results through the one year mark. 

■ CRIXIVAN is generally well tolerated. 

m CRIXIVAN can be taken with a light meal or on an empty stomach. There are side effects associated with protease 
inhibitors in general and CRIXIVAN in particular Some patients treated with CRIXIVAN may develop kidney stones. 
For some, this can lead to more severe kidney problems including kidney failure. Drinking at least 6 glasses of water 
each day may help reduce the chance of forming a kidney stone. Other side effects reported include rapid 
breakdown of red blood cells and liver problems. There are some common medications and AIDS-related medications 
you should not take with CRIXIVAN. Discuss all medications you are taking or plan to take with your doctor 

#As with other protease inhibitors, increased bleeding in some patients with hemophilia and increased 
blood sugar levels or diabetes have been reported. Please read the following page for detailed information 
on side effects and dosing. 

Please read the following page for more detailed information about CRIXIVAN. 


Remember to 
ask your doctor 
about CRIXIVAN. 


CRIXIVAN*

Going the distance. 


CRIXIVAN is a protease inhibitor that fights HIV. CRIXIVAN can help reduce the chance of illnesses and death 
associated with HIV. CRIXIVAN can also help lower the amount of HIV in your body (called “viral load") and raise your 
CD4T-cell count. Some patients may not experience these effects. CRIXIVAN is not a cure for HIV or AIDS.

Capsules 


Patient Information about CRIXIVAN' (KRiK-siit-van) 

for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) Infection 
Generic name: indinavir (in-DlH-nuh-veer) sulfate 


Please read this information before you start taking CRIXIVAN. Also, you should read the information included with CRIXIVAN each time you receive your prescription, just in case anything has changed. 
Remember, this information does not take the place of careful discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss CRIXIVAN when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. 
You should remain under a doctor’s care when using CRIXIVAN and should not change or stop treatment without first talking with your doctor. 


What is CRIXIVAN? 

CRIXIVAN is an oral capsule used for the treatment of HIV (Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus). HIV is the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome). CRIXIVAN is a type of HIV drug called a protease 
(PRO-tee-ase) inhibitor. 

How do es CRIXIVAN work? 

CRIXIVAN is a protease inhibitor that fights HIV. CRIXIVAN can help reduce your chances 
of getting illnesses associated with HIV. CRIXIVAN can also help lower the amount of 
HIV in your body (called “viral load”) and raise your CD4 (T) cell count. CRIXIVAN may 
not have these effects in all patients. 

CRIXIVAN is usually prescribed with other anti-HIV drugs such as ZDV (also called 
AZT), 3TC, ddl, ddC, or d4T. CRIXIVAN works differently from these other anti-HIV 
drugs. Talk with your doctor about how you should take CRIXIVAN. 

CRIXIVAN has been studied in adults. The safety and effectiveness of CRIXIVAN in 
children and adolescents have not been established. 

How should I take CRI XIVAN? 

There are six important things you must do to help you benefit from CRIXIVAN: 

1. Take CRIXIVAN capsules every day as prescribed by your doctor. Continue 
taking CRIXIVAN unless your doctor tells you to stop. Take the exact amount of 
CRIXIVAN that your doctor tells you to take, right from the very start. To help make 
sure you will benefit from CRIXIVAN, you must not skip doses or take “drug holidays.” 
If you don’t take CRIXIVAN as prescribed, the activity of CRIXIVAN may be reduced 
(due to resistance). 

2. Take CRIXIVAN capsules every 8 hours around the clock,every day. It may 

be easier to remember to take CRIXIVAN if you take it at the same time every day. 
If you have questions about when to take CRIXIVAN, your doctor or health care 
provider can help you decide what schedule works for you. 

3. If you miss a dose by more than 2 hours, wait and then take the next dose 
at the regularly scheduled time. However, if you miss a dose by less than 2 
hours, take your missed dose immediately. Then take your next dose at the regularly 
scheduled time. Do not take more or less than your prescribed dose of CRIXIVAN 
at any one time. 

4. Take CRIXIVAN with water. You can also take CRIXIVAN with other beverages such 
as skim or non-fat milk, juice, coffee, or tea. 

5. Ideally, take each dose of CRIXIVAN without food but with water at least 
one hour before or two hours after a meal. Or you can take CRIXIVAN with a 
light meal. Examples of light meals include: 

- dry toast with jelly, juice, and coffee (with skjm or non-fat milk and sugar 
if you want) 

- corn flakes with skim or non-fat milk and sugar 

Do not take CRIXIVAN at the same time as any meals that are high in calories, 
fat, and protein (for example — a bacon and egg breakfast). When taken at the 
same time as CRIXIVAN, these foods can interfere with CRIXIVAN being absorbed 
into your bloodstream and may lessen its effect. 

6. It is critical that you drink at least six 8-ounce glasses of liquid (preferably 
water) throughout the day, every day. CRIXIVAN can cause kidney stones. 
Having enough fluids in your body should help reduce the chances of forming 
a kidney stone. Call your doctor or other health care provider if you develop 
kidney pains (middle to lower stomach or back pain) or blood in the urine. 

Does CRIXIVAN cure HIV or AIDS? 

CRIXIVAN is not a cure.for HIV or AIDS. People taking CRIXIVAN may still develop infec¬ 
tions or other conditions associated with HIV. Because of this, it is very important for 
you to remain under the care of a doctor. Although CRIXIVAN is not a cure for HIV or 
AIDS, CRIXIVAN can help reduce your chances of getting illnesses, including death, 
associated with HIV. CRIXIVAN may not have these effects in all patients. 

Does CRIXIVAN reduce the risk of passing HIV to others? 

CRIXIVAN has not been shown to reduce the risk of passing HIV to others through 
sexual contact or blood contamination. 

Who should not take CRIXIVAN? 

Do not take CRIXIVAN if you have had a serious allergic reaction to CRIXIVAN or any 
of its components. 

What other medical problems or conditions should I discuss with my 
doctor ? 

Talk to your doctor if: 

■ You are pregnant or if you become pregnant while you are taking CRIXIVAN. We do 
not yet know how CRIXIVAN affects pregnant women or their developing babies. 

■ You are breast-feeding. You should stop breast-feeding if you are taking CRIXIVAN. 
Also talk to your doctor if you have: 

■ Problems with your liver, especially if you have mild or moderate liver disease caused 
by cirrhosis. 

■ Problems with your kidneys. 

■ Diabetes 

■ Hemophilia 

Tell your doctor about any medicines you are taking or plan to take, including 
non-prescription medicines. 


Can CRIXIVAN be taken with other medications?* * 

Drugs you should not take with CRIXIVAN: 

SELDANE® (terfenadine) HISMANAL® (astemizole) 

VERSED® (midazolam) HALCION® (triazolam) 

PROPULSID® (cisapride) Ergot medications (e.g., Wigraine® and Cafergot®) 

Taking CRIXIVAN with the above medications could result in serious or life-threatening 

problems (such as irregular heartbeat or excessive sleepiness). 

In addition, you should not take CRIXIVAN with rifampin, known as RIFADIN®, RIFAMATE®, 
RIFATER®, orRIMACTANE®. 

Drugs you can take with CRIXIVAN include: 

RETROVIR® (zidovudine, ZDV also called AZT) BIAXIN® (clarithromycin) 
TAGAMET® (cimetidine) isoniazid (INH) 

DIFLUCAN® (fluconazole) ORTHO-NOVUM 1 /35® (oral 

contraceptive) 

EPIVIR™ (lamivudine, 3TC) ZERIT® (stavudine, d4T) 

BACTRIM®/SEPTRA® (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) 

VIDEX® (didanosine, ddl) — If you take CRIXIVAN with VIDEX®, take them at least 
one hour apart. 

MYCOBUTIN® (rifabutin) — If you take CRIXIVAN with MYCOBUTIN®, your doctor 
may adjust both 

the dose of MYCOBUTIN and the dose of CRIXVAN. 

NIZORAL® (ketoconazole) — If you take CRIXIVAN with NIZORAL®, your doctor may adjust 
the dose of CRIXIVAN. 

Talk to your doctor about any medications you are taking. 

What ar e the p ossible si de eff ect s of CRIXI VAN? 

Like all prescription drugs. CRIXIVAN can cause side effects. The following is not a 
complete list of side effects reported with CRIXIVAN when taken either alone or with 
other anti-HIV drugs. Do not rely on this page alone for information about side effects. 
Your doctor can discuss with you a more complete list of side effects. 

Some patients treated with CRIXIVAN developed kidney stones. In some of these 
patients this led to more severe kidney problems, including kidney failure or 
inflammation of the kidneys. Drinking at least six 8-ounce glasses of liquid 
(preferably water) each day should help reduce the chances of forming a kidney 
stone. Call your doctor or other health care provider if you develop kidney pains (middle 
to lower stomach or back pain) or blood in the urine. 

Some patients treated with CRIXIVAN have had rapid breakdown of red blood cells 
(hemolytic anemia) which in some cases was severe or resulted in death. 

Some patients treated with CRIXIVAN have had liver problems including liver failure and 
death. Some patients had other illnesses or were taking other drugs. It is uncertain if 
CRIXIVAN caused these liver problems. 

Diabetes and high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) have occurred in patients taking protease 
inhibitors. In some of these patients, this led to ketoacidosis, a serious condition caused 
by poorly controlled blood sugar. Some patients had diabetes before starting protease 
inhibitors, others did not. Some patients required adjustments to their diabetes 
medication. Others needed new diabetes medication. 

In some patients with hemophilia, increased bleeding has been reported. 

Clinical Studies 

Increases in bilirubin (one laboratory test of liver function) have been reported in 
approximately 10% of patients. Usually, this finding has not been associated with 
liver problems. However, on rare occasions, a person may develop yellowing of the 
skin and/or eyes. 

Side effects occurring in 2% or more of patients included: abdominal pain,fatigue or 
weakness, flank pain, feeling unwell, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, acid regurgitation, loss 
of appetite, dry mouth, back pain, headache, trouble sleeping, dizziness, taste changes, 
rash, upper respiratory infection, dry skin, and sore throat. 

Swollen kidneys due to blocked urine flow occurred rarely. 

Marketing Experience 
Other side effects reported since CRIXIVAN 
has been marketed include: abdominal swelling; 
inflammation of the kidneys; increased fat 
appearing in areas such as the neck, abdomen, 
and back; change in skin color; severe skin 
reactions; hair loss; crystals in the urine; and 
allergic reactions. 

Tell your doctor promptly about these or any 
other unusual symptoms. If the condition 
persists or worsens, seek medical attention. 

How should I store CRIXIVAN capsules? 

u Keep CRIXIVAN capsules in the bottle they 
came in and at room temperature 
(59°F-86°F). 

■ Keep CRIXIVAN capsules dry by leaving 
the small desiccant “pillow” in the bottle. 

Keep the bottle closed. 


This medication is prescribed for a particular condition. Do not use it for any other condition or give it to anybody else. Keep CRIXIVAN and all medicines 
out of the reach of children. If you suspect that more than the prescribed dose of this medicine has been taken, contact your local poison control center 
or emergency room immediately. 

This provides a summary of information about CRIXIVAN. If you have any questions or concerns about either CRIXIVAN or HIV, talk to your doctor.

ALRP marks 15 years 


by Cynthia Laird 


xemplifying the legal com- 
|P : munity’s noblest instincts of 
volunteerism and public 
service, the AIDS Legal Referral 
Panel (ALRP) marked 15 years of 
legal service to the HIV commu¬ 
nity at a reception Wednesday, 
November 18. The event honored 
Bay Area lawyers and legal profes¬ 
sionals - over 1,200 of them - 
who have given their time and ex¬ 
pertise to protect the rights of 
people living with HIV and AIDS. 

The nations oldest organization 
dedicated to meeting the civil legal 
needs of people with HIV/AIDS, 
ALRP began in 1983 when a hand¬ 
ful of lawyers saw their friends be¬ 
come sick with a mysterious and 
fatal illness. Those lawyers estab¬ 
lished a list of volunteers who 
would visit people with AIDS at 
home and in hospitals to write 
wills and medical powers of attor¬ 
ney to help protect their rights. 

Since then, ALRP has assisted 
clients in over 30,000 legal mat¬ 
ters, said Irwin Keller, executive 
director. 

“People with HIV and AIDS 
today face new legal challenges. As 
people with HIV live longer lives, 
they are likely to encounter more 
legal problems,” said attorney 
Sarah Thomas, ALRP’s client ser¬ 
vices director. According to 
Thomas, the promise of new HIV 
therapies has caused many ALRP 
clients to think about entering or 
returning to the work force. Those 
considerations often involve 
sticky legal questions in order to 
take medications on time with the 
proper food, and how to respond 
to harassment or discrimination 
in the workplace. 

Another dramatic shift in the 
legal needs of people with HIV or 
AIDS has been in the area of 
housing. ALRP has experienced a 
tremendous upsurge in the num¬ 
ber of people with HIV or AIDS 
who need help responding to a 
residential eviction. This year, 
nearly one-quarter of all ALRP 



Supervisor Tom Ammiano delivers a proclamation to ALRP Board Co- 
Chair Diane Cash (center) and Executive Director Irwin Keller (R).

clients are calling for help with a 
housing matter. 

“Our clients are overwhelm¬ 
ingly poor,” Keller said. ‘They have 
been impoverished by AIDS and 
disability. They are often longtime 
tenants paying low rents. In San 
Francisco, a city with less than one 
percent vacancy, that makes them 
prime targets for eviction.” 

Responding to the crisis, ALRP 
launched its AIDS Housing Advo¬ 
cacy Project during this anniver¬ 
sary year. In addition to offering 
help through volunteer attorneys, 
ALRP staff will provide direct rep¬ 
resentation in eviction and hous¬ 
ing discrimination cases. Accord¬ 
ing to Peter Kearns, ALRP s hous¬ 
ing attorney, “Stable housing is es¬ 
sential for people to be able to 
manage a complex HIV treatment 
regimen. If evicted, our clients 
may end up homeless and unable 
to adhere to their HIV treatments. 
For these clients, maintaining 
shelter is quite literally a matter of 
life and death.” 

ALRP helps clients in a broad 
array of complex legal matters. 
The agency continues to assist 
New Zealand native Christopher 
Arnesen in his fight to obtain dis¬ 
ability benefits earned after near¬ 
ly 30 years of working and paying 
taxes in San Francisco. “Chris is 
caught in a bureaucratic Catch- 
22,” said Betsy Johnsen, ALRP’s 
benefits attorney. “He was told to

was told he needed to return to 
the U.S. in order to collect those 
benefits, but the INS [Immigra¬

barred him from returning be¬

sembled a team of volunteer 
lawyers to work on his case, which 
is still pending. According to 
Johnsen, “The case will set an im¬ 
portant precedent, hopefully a 
positive one.” 

Arnesen, a renowned travel 
photographer, had some of his 
images of Papua New Guinea on 
exhibit at the recent ALRP recep¬ 
tion and they were part of a silent 
and called auction to raise funds 
for the agency. T

white marble retaining wall,” Har¬ 
vey Milk Lives/Dan White will 
Die.” I was a first year college stu¬ 
dent, deeply closeted and scared 
of my own shadow. That graffito 
spurred my first political awaken¬ 
ing, engendering a painful lurch 
into activism after a childhood of 
suburban ease. How could I re¬ 
main in the closet, I thought, and 
turn my back on Harvey Milk’s 
extraordinary sacrifice? Harvey’s 
killing shamed me, and I would 
imagine many others, into com¬ 
ing out. Within weeks, its emotive 
power began to be registered 
across the land. Indeed, I first 
heard it a continent apart from 
the city that first gave him voice. 

But an international move¬ 
ment’s gain proved an immense 
local loss. The assassinations of 
Milk and Moscone gutted the 
progressive movement in San 
Francisco, a catastrophe that al¬ 
lowed Feinstein to become mayor, 
and rent hard won political al¬ 
liances. City Hall returned to a 
politics of containment and de¬ 
spite the best efforts of successor 
Harry Britt, the vision Milk set in 


motion would no longer find an 
enthusiastic echo among the 
City’s establishment. Old San 
Francisco drew succor from the 
defeat, and sought to reassert its 
primacy. The shocking mayoral 
victory of Frank Jordan but a few 
years ago is testament to the per¬ 
manence and depth of these scars. 

Yet, as we look back over the 
intervening twenty years, it’s clear 
that gains far outnumber losses. 
Old San Francisco, the city of tra¬ 
ditional blue collar families and 
big business, learned that if they 
wanted to continue their political 
influence they had to broker peace 
with queers. As a result, politics in 
San Francisco changed irrevoca¬ 
bly, and for the first time in Amer¬ 
ican political history, queers be¬ 
came a demographic group. Milk 
had turned an identity into a po¬ 
litical constituency - no easy feat, 
as the current inability of other 
communities in town to replicate 
queer electoral success has 
demonstrated. What made this 
community political power all the 
more remarkable is that for

pite his east coast roots - so what¬ 
ever political milestones Milk 
would have achieved here could 
have been, and I suspect would 
have been, contained by the sim¬ 
ple disclaimer, “ That’s San Fran¬ 
cisco, whaddya expect.” From the 
city famed as the epicenter of 
fruits and nuts, the election of a 
man like Milk was not terribly big 
news, at least nationally; it had no 
substantial political fallout nor 
was it deemed predictive of a new 
wave of national queer political 
power. Milk remained a small 
scale local politician, and his pres¬ 
ence on the Board of Supervisors 
was understood as more a state¬ 
ment about this town than about 
a developing queer political 
movement. It was his assassina¬ 
tion that gave him the national 
platform he previously lacked - 
and the White Night riots that 
consolidated his beatification. 

Martyrdom is powerful pre¬ 
cisely because it gives abstractions 
like justice or freedom material 
human form. Dead, Milk embod¬ 
ied so many more such abstrac¬ 
tions than the living politician 


could ever possibly contain. This 
is what we mean when we say that 
someone is larger than life, and 
the weird paradox is that Harvey 
Milk became larger than life only 
when he was no longer in it. For¬ 
tunately for his martyrdom, Milk 
died sufficiently early in office to 
provide few historical counter-ex¬ 
amples to our hagiographic con¬ 
structions of him. We wanted and 
needed a leader who was a politi¬ 
cal genius, who was all untram¬ 
meled promise, a visionary who 
would go on to major state and 
then national office, and would 
unite us and represent our face to 
the world. He had to be bigger 
than us, yet warm, good humored 
and familiar, and if his eminently 
quotable prognostications proved 
eerily on target and gave form to 
our future, well it didn’t hurt to 
have a touch of the divine about 
him. 

In death, Milk offered all these 
things and more. ( I find that I 
even have trouble writing “Milk.” 
I want to call him by the familiar 
Harvey, though I never knew him. 
It just feels right.) The fact that 
politics is compromise, that Har¬ 
vey was a white male in an era of 
increasing separatist commit¬ 
ments, that, given the forces ar-

queers communal affiliation 
comes relatively late in life; few of 
us have rose-tinged, nostalgic 
childhood memories of our queer 
families. In the post-Milk San 
Francisco, we moved in, came out 
and registered up. Doubtless, the 
so-called “Lavender Sweep” of 
queers into elected office is a di¬ 
rect result of these changes. 

Moreover, a conservative ho¬ 
mophobic faction in San Francis¬ 
co politics, forever tainted by its as¬ 
sociation with murder, had no 
choice but to moot its rhetoric. 
Now, generally speaking, we have 
to import our homophobes from 
out of town. Harvey’s murder gave 
queer bashing a beloved human 
face. In the aftermath of the White 
Night riots, now it was the police 
who positioned themselves as the 
guardians of old San Francisco, not 
the politicians. Of course, as the 
queers and the cops increasingly 
squared off, politicians were able to 
effect a containment of our influ¬ 
ence and yet stay above the fray. 
But the echo of the White Night 
riots - referenced by ACT UP, 
Queer Nation, even the protests 
after Wilson vetoed AB101 - is that 
in San Francisco, civil disobedience 
can yield social change. The im¬ 
plicit threat of a riot every time we 
take to the streets has tended to 
amplify our voice and give teeth to 
our demands. 

Namesakes 

Perhaps the most telling lega¬ 
cy of Harvey Milk is the explosion 
of cultural initiatives set up in his 
name. There is an elementary 
school named after him in the 
Castro, a Democratic Club, a City 
Parks and Recreation Center, and 
now a community based queer 
studies education facility, the Har¬ 
vey Milk Institute. I’m moved by 
the sweep and scope of these trib¬ 
utes, touching on kids, politics, 
quality of life, and education - all 
issues Harvey himself held dear. 
But the real measure of these trib¬ 
utes is that they all imply a vision 
of a San Francisco in which queer 
presence is woven throughout the 
life of this city. Following Harvey’s 
murder, queerness could finally 
break through. We were, of 
course, always there, but now we 
could be named, and our name 
became Harvey Milk. 

Nationally, the murders ush¬ 
ered queers into the select club of 
victims of political assassination. 
It was a paradoxical tribute to our 
rising power and influence, and 
Milk gave us the moral authority 
to speak with the same visceral 
emotional and rhetorical force as 
others engaged in the battle for 
civil rights. We always said ours 
was a civil rights struggle; now we 
could prove it. We had our own 
King. 

Since Harvey died what was 
simply a neighborhood has be¬ 
come a symbol - one that is at 
once local, national and interna¬ 
tional. Castro and Market is 
mecca , epicenter of a now global 
community. For those of us who 
live here, queer community is 
written into daily life - in markets 
and cafes, hospitals and hospices, 
lobbying groups and law firms, in 
the speeches of elected and ap¬ 
pointed politicians, in the services 
of religious institutions and anti- 
religious institutions, and the 
countless other organizations all 
serving our needs. But for the 
world at large, the very ordinari¬ 
ness of our lives is the stuff of 
dreams. In a relatively small city 
on the edge of a vast ocean, a once 
fatal struggle to win civil rights 
has turned into a comfortable 
place to live an ordinary life. 
That’s no small achievement. ▼ 


Who he was 

◄ page 1 

dinner November 26, the night 
before he died. My longtime 
friend and roommate Mick Ri- 
dolfi wondered when Harvey 
had last enjoyed a home-cooked 
meal, and suggested we invite 
him over, for dinner. Harvey’s 
last dinner consisted of a huge 
steak, and we even convinced 
him to enjoy a bit of wine in a 
birthday toast. 

Milk, never having much 
money, was concerned that he 
hadn’t brought a gift, and asked 
“What can I give you for your 
birthday, Wayne?” Knowing that 
supervisors were given free tick¬ 
ets to all 49er’s home games, I 
said I’d love his tickets to the 
Steelers-Niners game that was to 
be played the next night. 

Harvey said, “You got ’em.” 
(Had they been ballet or opera 
tickets, incidentally, he wouldn’t 
have been as eager to give them 
up, but he could have cared less 
about seeing a pro football 
game.) 

As Harvey left my house later 
that evening, the last time I ever 
saw him, he invited me to City 
Hall the next morning to attend 
the noon swearing-in ceremony 


of Don Horanzy. Horanzy was 
the man that Mayor Moscone 
had picked to replace Supervisor 
Dan White, who had quit. 

The news arrives 

While taking a shower before 
heading to City Hall the morn¬ 
ing of November 27,1 received a 
phone call from Richard (Sweet- 
lips) Walters, telling me he had 
just heard on the radio that the 
mayor had been shot; five min¬ 
utes later, then-supervisor Carol 
Ruth Silver called. 

I remember her exact words: 
“Wayne, please sit down before 
I tell you this. Harvey is gone, 
Dan White just shot him to 
death.” 

Harvey had lived on Henry 
Street, only a few blocks from 
my home. I immediately took 
the set of keys I had to his 
apartment, went to his home, 
woke his roommate at the time 
to tell him what happened, and 
spent the rest of the day helping 
to keep the media and the curi¬ 
ous from his apartment, and 
welcoming those close to him 
who had no place else to go, but 
who wanted to be there where 
Harvey lived. 

Within three hours of Har¬ 
vey’s death, the steps to his 
apartment were covered with 


flowers, burning candles, and 
notes of sorrow. The rest, obvi¬ 
ously, is now history. 

A lot of people knew Harvey 
Milk; some were closer to him 
both personally and politically 
than was I, but we spent count¬ 
less nights talking, thinking, 
planning - yes, even plotting - 
what Harvey felt was the future 
of the gay rights movement. 
Milk not only cared about gays 
and fesbians and those now-fa- 
mous young gay teenagers he 
spoke of in the unfriendly small 
towns of the middle west, but he 
was, first and always, a coalition 
builder. He knew well that gays 
and lesbians couldn’t gain their 
rightful place alone, without the 
help and support of other mi¬ 
norities. 

Do I miss the guy? Certainly. 
Even after 20 years, I still think 
of those late-night phone calls 
when Milk would come up with 
a brainstorm idea that couldn’t 
wait until morning; the many 
nights when he would come by 
the N’Touch, a Polk Street bar 
where I worked during those 
days, and wait for me to get off 
work so that we could go to the 
Grubstake, a popular after- 
hours restaurant on Pine Street 
where gays would go for break¬ 
fast after the bars closed. Harvey 


often held court there, talking 
about politics and the gay rights 
movement, sometimes until 
daylight. Always the center of at¬ 
tention, usually controlling the 
topic of conversation, the guy 
could draw people to him like 
moths to a light bulb. 

Harvey was stubborn to a 
fault, self-centered, and even 
rude at times, but always with 
the vision of what he thought 
was best for the gay rights move¬ 
ment - and, he was usually 
right. 

I honestly haven’t seen the 
likes of the guy since, and while 
I know it sounds like an over¬ 
used cliche, there isn’t likely to 
be another Harvey for a hell of a 
long time. 

There are so many truly in¬ 
teresting Milk stories, but there 
isn’t time or space to share 
them. Incidentally, a couple of 
weeks after Hafvey was killed, 
and the furor over his murder 
had subsided somewhat, I re¬ 
ceived a phone call from Milk’s

GAY SPERM DONORS 

WANTED 

Lesbians seek Gay Men to play “Uncle” 

OAKLAND - Rainbow Flag Sperm Bank is recruiting Gay donors for Lesbians. We tell the 
mother who the donor is when the child is 3 months old. Under California law donors have 
neither financial obligations or custody rights. Knowing the donor can be very important 
to the child. Some children start asking about their biological fathers at 3 years of age. 
Being a donor gives Gay Men an opportunity to have children in their lives and connects 
them to Lesbian families. Many Lesbians want donors to play “Uncle.” The demand for 
known donors is much greater than the supply. All ethnic backgrounds are needed especially 
African American and Jewish men. If healthy & under 55, call our donor information line...

SF gay center hires 
Walton as project mgr. 


by Cynthia Laird 


he Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, 
Transgender (LGBT) Com- 
lf munity Center Project an¬ 
nounced Monday, November 16, 
that Scott Walton has been hired 
as the project manager. Walton, 
formerly with Digital Queers, is 
responsible for helping the pro¬ 
ject’s board of directors to com¬ 
plete fundraising to build the cen¬ 
ter at 1800 Market Street. 

Walton, who’ll start his new job 
December 1, was hired at an an¬ 
nual salary of $50,000, said Dana 
Van Gorder, CCP board member. 

“We are thrilled to hire some¬ 
one of Scott’s dedication and skill 
to help us in this major endeavor,” 
said Brenda Barnette, CCP board 
president. “Scott’s background is 
perfectly suited to us. He has 
worked as an executive director of 
a community center, and has 
enormous passion for the role 
centers play in the lives of LGBT 
people. Scott has great skill in 
planning and carrying out major 
fundraising plans. And he has 
great skills in working with start¬ 
up organizations like the center.” 

The cost of building the 41,000 
square-foot center is set at $10.75 
million, including the cost of 
land, design, and construction. 
The CCP board has raised $8 mil¬ 
lion toward the total cost, includ¬ 
ing several million dollars in city 
funds. The CCP is. in the midst of 



Scott Walton 


its $3.5 million capital campaign. 

Walton told the Bay Area Re¬ 
porter that the biggest part of his 
job will be to help complete 
fundraising for the center. “There 
will be some community outreach 
and program development work 
too,” said Walton. He added that 
once the capital campaign is com¬ 
pleted, he’ll move on to other 
fundraising projects to furnish the 
center and maintain operating 
costs. Groundbreaking is slated 
for September 1999 with the cen¬ 
ter scheduled to open in late 2001. 

“The sum we are raising is 
larger than has ever been raised for 
a capital campaign in San Francis¬ 
co’s LGBT community,” said Bar¬ 
nette. “We are confident it can be 
raised, but we need participation 
from the entire community.” 

Walton said the CCP board’s 
decision to hire a project manag¬ 
er is simply a natural progression 


for the project, and while 
fundraising efforts haven’t stalled, 
he will be looking for major 
donors and contributions from 
people who have not yet pledged 
financial support for the center. 

Prior to the job at Digital 
Queers, Walton was director of 
development for the Horizons 
Foundation and he used to be ex¬ 
ecutive director at the Pacific Cen¬ 
ter in Berkeley. Before moving to 
the Bay Area, Walton ran an AIDS 
service organization in Michigan. 
He’s been a volunteer for the 
community center for the last six 
months or so, he added. 

“I’m very excited about the 
project itself,” Walton said, adding 
he feels the city lacks “sort of a 
boiling pot” he hopes the com¬ 
munity center will become; a 
place where services interact and 
new services can begin. 

Added Barnette, “When it is 
completed in the winter of 2001, the 
center will house activities and ser¬ 
vices that welcome every member of 
our community. And so, we are 
hopeful that as many people as pos¬ 
sible will make a contribution of any 
amount they can afford to make this 
important new resource a reality.” ▼ 


The CCP can be contacted at

Nobody's helping fight AIDS 
in Napa , Solano - and that's good! 
Vallejo benefit Sunday for Rainbow Fund 


by Mark Norby 


'' he Rainbow Fund will host 
its eighth annual Charity 
S Auction from 1 to 4 p.m. 
this Sunday, November 29 at No¬ 
body’s Place in downtown Valle¬ 
jo. The Rainbow Fund is an all¬ 
volunteer organization that do¬ 
nates 100 percent of all money 
they raise to charities working in 
the field of HIV/AIDS in Solano 


AIDS docs 
ready 
next step 

by Ed Susman, UPI 


M rogress in ridding the AIDS 
virus from the blood has 
ll led top U.S. researchers to 
propose the first study that 
would halt drug treatment in 
HIV-infected patients with unde¬ 
tectable virus levels. The propos¬ 
al follows new studies announced 
Sunday, November 15, showing 
aggressive drug therapy eliminat¬ 
ed HIV from the blood of three 
infected patients. At the Infec¬ 
tious Diseases Society of America 
meeting in Denver, Dr. Anthony 
Fauci, director of the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infec¬ 
tious Diseases, said that the im¬ 
mune enhancer Interleukin-2 
(IL-2) was added for several 
weeks to a combination of drugs 
including protease inhibitors. 

Fauci said the therapy did not 
work consistently in the 14 men 
who received active treatment. In 
six of the men, however, no HIV 
could be detected in up to 20 
million copies of immune system 
cells. In three of the six, no HIV 
was found in 300 million im¬ 
mune cells. In one patient, HIV 
traces could not be detected in a 
biopsy of his lymph node tissue, 
either. In 12 other HIV-infected 
men who did not receive IL-2, 
HIV-infected immune system 
cells were detected at the end of 
the study. 

Based on that success, re¬ 
searchers have designed the 
unique study. Fauci told UPI, 
“We have written a protocol in 
which patients who have no sign 
of virus in the blood would have 
their medication withdrawn to 
see if the virus will continue to be 
suppressed. “ Still, he said, “I per¬ 
sonally believe the virus will 
come back.” 

Despite the risks, Fauci said 
patients are willing to stop taking 
medication and test the theory 
that eradicating HIV virus from 
the blood is sufficient to prevent 
re-emergence of the infection. 
Although the regimen has been 
successful in driving down the 
levels of virus in the blood, there 
are serious side effects associated 
with the treatments, including 
diabetes, kidney stones and de¬ 
velopment of unsightly fat de¬ 
posits on the back, shoulder and 
abdomen. 

Other attempts to eliminate 
HIV are underway around the 
world, some using the anti-can¬ 
cer drug hydroxyurea along with 
protease inhibitors to try to get 
at the latent AIDS virus in the 
body. ▼ 


and Napa counties. 

Nobody’s Place, an “interna¬ 
tional bar where everyone is 
someone,” as the bar proudly cel¬ 
ebrates itself, is the place where 
the Rainbow Fund emerged. 

“Our customers are diverse 
and established the Rainbow 
Fund as a way of supporting im¬ 
portant charities in our commu¬ 
nity while having fun and a good 
time,” says Nobody’s Place owner 
Ray Snyder. 

“The weekly Sunday football 
lunch parties are an important 
fund-raiser as well, providing ca¬ 
maraderie and good food for four 
bucks,” continues Snyder, “the 
whole amount goes to the Rain¬ 
bow Fund.” 

Past recipients of funds have 
included Planned Parenthood, the 
Napa AIDS Project, Meals on 
Wheels, Solano AIDS WALK ’98, 
to name just a few. 

The auction items this year 
will include Napa wines donated 
by Edgewood Estate, Sutter 


Home, Prager Port Cellars, Mon- 
tevina, and other fine vineyards, 
as well as a vintage jukebox. The 
Rainbow Fund would like to en¬ 
courage other business and com¬ 
munity members to donate new 
and first-class used items for the 
auction. Those interested should 
call (707) 645-7298. 

In eight years the volunteer 
group has raised more than 
$70,000 for local HIV/AIDS 
groups. The wider Bay Area com¬ 
munity and all visitors to the area 
are cordially invited to attend and 
participate in Sunday’s event. Or¬ 
ganizers will see to it that No¬ 
body’s Place becomes everybody’s 
place, and the Rainbow Fund will 
be the backdrop of essential com¬ 
munal charity. ▼

Viral load ups and downs 


by Bill Snow, ACT UP/ 
Golden Gate Writers Pool 

H t may seem like forever, but we 

I have only had quantitative 
HIV viral load measurements 
widely available for about three 
years. In that time, viral load has 
matched (if not supplanted) T- 
cells as the most important mark¬ 
er for clinical trials, drug ap¬ 
proval, prognosis, and treatment 
decision-making. Three genera¬ 
tions of the viral load tests - reg¬ 
ular, sensitive, and ultra-sensitive 


- have followed one another, 
homing in on viral suppression by 
moving toward lower and lower 
levels of detection. With third 
generation ultra-sensitive tests 
newly available, but not officially 
approved, it would be informative 
to shed some light on what viral 
load counts mean, how reliable 
they are, and the politics of using 
and paying for them. 

What is viral load? 

The currently available viral 
load tests measure virus in the 
blood by one of two methods: 


FREE BASIC* DENTAL SERVICES

PEOPLE WITH HIV AND AIDS 


(Funded through the City and County of San Francisco under CARE Tide 1) 

Persons must qualify and document eligibility to receive 
CARE Title 1 services {letter of HIV diagnosis, residency in

Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. 


PCR by Roche or branch DNA 
(bDNA) by Chiron. The two 
methods are very different, but 
most researchers agree that they 
are equally good and reliable. The 
Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approved the Roche medi¬ 
um-sensitive test (which mea¬ 
sures down to 500 copies/mL) 
some time ago, but in the last 
few months it has com- 
monly become possi¬ 
ble to measure viral 
load down to 50 
copies/mL, with new 
ultra-sensitive Roche 
and Chiron assays. 

Either test has certain 
innate limitations. 

They don’t distin¬ 
guish between virus 
that can and cannot 
replicate, and there can be a great 
many “non-productive” viral par¬ 
ticles in the blood, so two people 
with the same viral load count 
may have different levels of infec¬ 
tious virus. Since the test only 
measures virus in blood, more 
painstaking and unavailable 
analyses of tissue and other, pro¬ 
tected compartments of the body, 
like testicles and brain, may have 
different amounts (and different 
mutations) of virus. 

How reliable is it? 

Finally, the test is based on a 
logarithmic scale, which means 
that each factor of 10 is an equal 
measurement (50 to 500 say, or 
5,000 to 50,000, or even 50,000 to 
500,000 are all equivalent differ¬ 
ences!) Furthermore, the tests are 
accurate to about half a log, so 





for advanced lesions 

This is a Phase l trial of an intravenous drug that has shown 
improvement of lesions m an earlier trial. < dU54i(* is an 
anti-angiogenesis drug that inhibits the growth of cells. 
It is NOT a chemotherapy drug. The study requires 
bi-weekly infusions for one month. Thereafter, ?>U54l(* is 
available to participants for up to one year. 


Main Qualifications... 


Must have extensive, active lesions that are no 
longer responding to, a standard treatment. 

Must not have pulmonary 

Must be stable on any antiretroviral therapy excluding 
experimental drugs.

two readings, with one being 
three times the other could be due 
solely to test variability. (Since one 
log equals 10 times, half a log is 10 
to the one-half power, or the 
square root of 10, about 3.16 
times.) 

In addition, until now the two 
tests gave different results. Often 
the Roche PCR test gave higher 
results, which varied from in¬ 
dividual to individual, 
but was generally dou¬ 
ble or more the viral 
load on the Chiron 
less-sensitive assays. 
This was a problem for 
someone who switched 
labs or assays, or who 
was getting viral load 
from more that one 
source, for example 
in a clinical trial and doctor’s of¬ 
fice. 

' Meanwhile practitioners talk 
about viral load levels as if they 
were uniform. They talk about 
“undetectable” virus, which has 
evolved from under 10,000 copies, 
to under 500, to under 50 - and 
down to five copies in some ex¬ 
perimental settings. This chase to¬ 
ward exactitude is driven by the 
desire to actually approach viral 
eradication, which in turn is an 
effort to forestall activity that 
would lead to mutations. When 
Chiron labs tested a large number 
of samples that had been below 
500 copies/mL on the older test, 
50 to 60 percent were also below 
50 copies, 30 percent were be¬ 
tween 50 and 500 copies, and 10 
to 20 percent were over 500. In 
addition, with their new version 
Chiron’s raw numbers are much 
closer to the Roche PCR, so their 
new test either consciously or ac¬ 
cidentally is much more in line 
with the approved PCR assay, 
which has been more widely used 
in a research setting. 

Using the results 

Those of us who can’t get an¬ 
tivirals to reduce our viral load to 
these low levels are somewhat at 


the mercy of the chase toward un¬ 
detectability. The new Chiron 
assay, version 3.0, is stated to give 
levels that are one to three times 
higher than the version two tests, 
which many of us, especially in 
Northern California, have been 
using as a standard. 

Chiron has explained this in a 
“Dear Doctor” letter. Davies and 
Chiron labs have switched to the 
new sensitive assay, so most peo¬ 
ple who are not still undetectable 
should establish new baselines be¬ 
fore assuming that a rise in their 
viral load it anything more than a 
result of the new assay. Doctors 
and patients need to stay calm 
and get used to higher numbers 
that may not mean anything has 
changed. 

Payment 

Last week many of us got an 
urgent e-mail from Brenda Lein at 
Project Inform because the Health 
Care Finance Administration 
(HCFA) has been holding a series 
of meetings over Medicare/Med¬ 
icaid coverage of diagnostic and 
monitoring tests. 

Essentially, HCFA proposed 
that a National Policy recommen¬ 
dation be made that Medicare 
covers only FDA-approved tests. 
What this means is that only the 
Roche PCR less sensitive test 
would be reimbursed. Currently 
states are given codes to cover 
HIV RNA monitoring and testing 
that they can use at their discre¬ 
tion, whereas the new policy 
would only reimburse for the 
older Roche test. 

People who are following stan¬ 
dard of care guidelines and using 
more sensitive HIV RNA moni¬ 
toring tests (e.g., limit of detec¬ 
tion 50) would no longer be able 
to use these tests or they would 
have to pay out of pocket if 
Medicare had been their source 
for reimbursement. Yet, even the 
Department of Health and 
Human Services guidelines are 
being revised to this standard. Al-

Daniel L. Celeri 

December 31, 1957 — 
December 7, 1998 


Daniel was 
peacefully born into 
his spiritual body, 
free of pain, sad¬ 
ness, and the hard¬ 
ships of life. He 
fought his illness 
with admirable 
courage and deter¬ 
mination. Everyone 
fortunate enough to 
meet Daniel was honestly transformed, 
if only for a moment — some of us for 
a lifetime. 

Daniel was a member of Omote 
Senke School of Japanese Tea Ceremo¬ 
ny, where the problems and distractions 
of everyday life were replaced by an ap¬ 
preciation of beauty, simplicity, and 
spiritual tranquillity. 

He loved dancing, drawing, and 
painting. His childlike smile and magi¬ 
cal personality will be missed by many. 

Daniel is survived by his lifetime 
companion Shizuo, his brother Jason, 
his nieces Lanice and Tasia, Danny N., 
Tom & Nancy L., Winnie, Kona, and 
many more friends. 


We love and will miss you Daniel 
until our paths cross again. Now you 
truly have become a “Knight of the 
White Light.” 

A memorial will be held at St. Bene¬ 
dict’s Parish (Pine & Octavia) on De¬ 
cember 6th at 5 p.m. 

In lieu of flowers, please make a do¬ 
nation to Project Open Hand, St. Mary’s 
Hospital, or the AIDS Emergency Fund. 

Barry Thornton Jennings 

August 18, 1944 — 

November 11,1998 


Barry died un¬ 
expectedly at his 
home in San Fran¬ 
cisco. He was 54 
years old. Born and 
raised in Phoenix, 
Arizona, his name¬ 
sake and Godfather 
was Senator Barry 
Goldwater. 

He was a grad¬ 
uate of Ttolane University in New Or¬ 
leans, and spent the next year at the 
Sorbonne in Paris. Barry was fluent in 
French and German and traveled exten¬ 
sively in Europe. He had a great love 
and knowledge of both history and ge¬ 
ography. 

After college Barry taught in the 
Washington, D.C. public school system. 
He then entered U.S. civil service and 
had a successful career at the IRS in 
Human Resources. He transferred to 
San Francisco in the late 1970s to be the 
head of Human Resources for the West¬ 
ern Division of IRS until 1985. Most re¬ 
cently Barry worked for Fisher Develop¬ 
ment, Inc., in the accounting depart¬ 
ment. 

Barry attended the Episcopal 
Church and was a deeply spiritual man. 
To his many friends in the City and to 
his co-workers, he was a loving and 
loyal friend and will be deeply missed 
for his many contributions to our lives. 

Kenneth Charles Segara 

July 27,1949 — November 2,1998 


With his lover by his side, Kenny 
slipped peacefully into eternal rest while 
hospitalized at the V.A. Hospital in San 
Francisco. Kenny had a long and coura¬ 
geous struggle, fighting many infec¬ 


tions. His will to 
live was an inspira¬ 
tion, admired by all 
who knew him, in¬ 
cluding his doctors 
and nurses whose 
compassion and 
professional care 
showed indeed - the 
superior human 
beings they are. 

Kenny was born in Queens, N.Y. and 
had a college degree in Liberal Arts. He 
joined the Navy where, upon falling in 
love with San Francisco, he literally 
jumped ship and took up"permanent 
residence here. 

He was in real estate and furniture 
sales for a number of years, and was a 
popular waiter at Le Domino. He was 
also a member of the Castro Lyons. 

Ken was a great cook, and loved to 
create dinner parties, always impeccably 
dressed, and blessed with stunning good 
looks. 

Kenny had many loving friends 
whose true loyalty lasted throughout his 
life. Kindness personified were his 
friends, Ray Bucher and Sam Singer. He 
is survived by his mother, Gloria Dunn, 
sister, Diana Mahony, and devoted life 
partner, William Houston. 

“We fought the battle together, 
Honey, and I’ll cherish your memory 
forever — I love you Kenney.” Inter¬ 
ment was at the National Cemetery in 
San Joaquin Valley (near Fresno).

1997 as the Wicked Witch of the West 
wearing the ruby slippers and carrying 
Dorothy’s head in a basket were the ulti¬ 
mate expression of Jaymes-Mark’s camp 
sensibility. He was one funny queen! 

His ail-singing, all-dancing, all-jok¬ 
ing Joan Crawford persona was wel¬ 
comed from San Francisco to Province- 
town, where he was the darling of this 
Summer’s Carnival. 

As a big-voiced and exuberant bass- 
baritone, he also appeared in trousers 
often with the Lamplighters, and at the 
Bracebridge Christmas dinners in 


Yosemite. 

There are no appropriate words, no 
poetry, to describe the loopy silly be¬ 
nign glow that Jaymes-Mark always 
seemed to emit, and his deep tender 
soul that was almost palpable beneath 
his skin. 

He was one of life’s gentle creatures, 
and his friends and many significant 
others feel a great sadness that we will 
no longer enjoy the simple pleasure of 
his presence. 

A memorial concert to celebrate 
Jaymes-Mark is planned for the Spring.

joked Neil Samonte, who started 
playing volleyball five years ago, 
first at a class at City College, then 
as part of the Saturday morning 
games at Eureka Valley Recreation 
Center in the Castro. Over the 
years, he’s seen that the sport is 
competitive, even in gay leagues. 
But it doesn’t have the pressure of 
the closet. 

“It’s easier to be yourself,” said 
Groen. “You don’t have to worry. 
If you act queeny, it’s not looked 
down upon. People have so much 
fun.” 

Samonte added that “It’s also 
fun to play against straight teams. 
We queen it up, but still play 
hard.” 

Amsterdam was Groen’s first 
Gay Games, and “a lot of fun,” he 
said. Both men hope to play in 
Sydney 2002, but know that the 
expenses and travel distance may 
deter a lot of worthy athletes. 

Stunt persons 

Dave Karraker, who sported a 
Gay Games V T-shirt from 
Czechoslovakia, mentioned there 
were 270 teams overall in the 
sport, but due to their highly- 
ranked level, GAPA Godzilla 
played against only a half-dozen 
teams, mostly with those they play 
at U.S. tournaments. 

“The hope was there’d be more 
teams from other countries,” Kar¬ 
raker said, but more foreign teams 
competed in B and BB categories.

',>/A and Dean Devlin’s recent 
' cinematic version of 
Godzilla is, like its creators, queer 
in a big way - becoming an asex¬ 
ual self-reproducing male with a 
tail - here in San Francisco, he’s 
always been gay. 

The 4-year-old GAPA Godzil¬ 
la, the Gay Asian Pacific Alliance’s 
volleyball team, returned stateside 
with big victories at Gay Games V, 
a silver medal in the AA Division; 
they also took second at the 
NAGVA 1997 Nationals in 
Philadelphia, and took first place 
at a recent Los Angeles regional 
competition. 

Danny Wong, one of the orig¬ 
inal organizers of the team, said 
that “we’ve definitely evolved,” 
with new players and more expe¬ 
rience (but no parthenogenetical- 
ly-produced eggs, as yet). 

Despite being a San Francisco 
native, Wong did not find coming 
out any easier than most. “There 
were no role models, and in the 
Chinese-American commu¬ 
nity, you don’t even talk 
about sex, let alone being 

gay” 

It was only after college 
and after meeting fellow 
teacher the late Tim Curbo, 
who happened to be the open¬ 
ly gay lover of Tom Am- 
miano, that Wong 
found it in himself to 
be open as well. Along 
with becoming an out 
gay teacher, he’s 
helped develop one of the Bay 
Area’s most popular sports for gay 
men. 

Wong saw how Gay Games 
helps create communities where 
athletes gain self-esteem and take 
it back home. He noted how 


The fearsome Godzilla. 


many people from all over the 
world return with a new determi¬ 
nation and freedom to be out. 

“Once you’ve en¬ 
joyed it like that, 
being so comfort¬ 
able, you can’t go back.” 

He did note a dearth of 
global diversity in the num¬ 
bers of attendees, particular¬ 
ly since he, like many 
players, spent almost 
the entire week play¬ 
ing, and even then 
mostly against other 
U.S. teams. Most of 
gay volleyball’s best teams are 
from Los Angeles,.New York, and 
Denver. 

Butching it up 

South San Francisco’s Henry 
Groen, of the San Jose Joy Luck 
Club, commented on the popu¬ 
larity of volleyball among gay 
men. “It’s more acceptable and it’s 
easier to pick up than some other 
sports, and it’s not as violent.” 

Joy Luck Clubbers didn’t have 
enough players to go as a full 
team, since some couldn’t afford 
to go, so they combined forces 
with GAPA to create the power¬ 
house of spikers and setters. 

“We usually play in gay tour¬ 
naments,” Groen said, “but we 
also compete as part of the North¬ 
ern California Volleyball Associa¬ 
tion. There’s a lot of straight 
teams there. It’s very competitive, 
and we have to work harder.” 

“We butch it up a little bit,”

Touch (STT) massage volunteer 
team was formed. By 1989, STT 
volunteers served 19 health care 
facilities in the Bay Area. 

Today, Smith’s articles, audio 
tapes, video tapes, and training 
materials continue to inspire 
thousands of volunteers for 
PWAs. 

Weyand said the grove will 
erect a tent in the meadow to as¬ 
sure the ceremony will proceed in 
the event of inclement weather. 
World AIDS Day also marks the 
completion of the construction of 
the grove and kicks off the “En¬ 
sure Remembrance Campaign” 
that will fund the permanent care 
of the grove. 

The National AIDS Memorial 
Grove is located in the eastern end 
T)f the park, north of the bowling 
greens and west of the tennis 
courts. For more information on

UCSF symposium 

UCSF’s AIDS Research Insti¬ 
tute presents the second annual 
World AIDS Day symposium, 
“On the Road to an HIV Vaccine” 
Tuesday from 2 to 5 p.m. at Cole 
Hall, 513 Parnassus Avenue. A re¬ 
ception will follow. For informa¬ 
tion, call (415) 597-9203; registra¬ 
tion is free. 

The keynote speaker is Dr. 
Neal Nathanson, director of the 
National Institutes of Health’s Of¬ 
fice of AIDS Research. He’ll be 
discussing why an AIDS vaccine is 
so hard to develop. In a career 
spanning 35 years, Nathanson is 
known particularly for his contri¬ 
butions to the field of viral epi¬ 
demiology as the author of the

silver medalists, noted that 
Godzilla sort of rules the roost, in 
that “around here there aren’t 
many top level AA teams that are 
gay, so we play NCVA.” 

“And won the title last year 
against straight teams,” Karraker 
added. Team members also play 
doubles and outdoor as well (on 
grass, not beaches, leaving that to 
the overtanned SoCal league that 
hogs the limited ESPN time this 
sport receives). 

When asked about the best 
way to avoid the dreaded knee in¬ 
juries volleyball players can suffer, 
due to the frequent falling to save 
the ball, the men laughed after 
blurting in unison, “Don’t play!” 

“Seriously, you have to learn 
how to fall,” said Karraker. “When 
you get more mature, you have to 
ice before and after every game.” 

Albert Ha, who started playing 
four years ago, said, “When that 
adrenaline is high, you kind of 
sacrifice your bodies to go for that 
ball,” which makes kneepads, and 
the ability to be your own stunt 
man, almost a necessity. 

Ha has fond memories of Gay 
Games. “It was great to see all the 


Round two 


definitive papers on the epidemi¬ 
ology of polio. In recent years, his 
NIH-sponsored work has includ¬ 
ed studies in the mechanisms by 
which HIV causes disease. 

The Office of AIDS Research 
has made HIV vaccine develop¬ 
ment a high priority, restructur¬ 
ing and revitalizing the program 
and providing significantly in¬ 
creased resources for this effort. 

A featured presentation will 
also be made by Dr. Lawrence K. 
Altman, medical correspondent 
for the New York Times. Altman is 
one of the few medical doctors 
working as a full time daily news¬ 
paper reporter. He will be speak¬ 
ing on perspectives on the chal¬ 
lenges of the AIDS vaccine. Alt¬ 
man, who joined the New York 
Times science staff in 1969, is an 
award-winning science journalist. 

“The Current State of the Vac¬ 
cine,” is a panel presentation that 
will Be moderated by Dr. Jay Levy, 
a professor in UCSF’s Depart¬ 
ment of Medicine. The panel will 
include distinguished scientists in 
the fields of clinical medicine, epi¬ 
demiology, and ethics, including 
Drs. Susan Buchbinder, James 
Kahn, and Bernard Lo. 

Levy has been involved in re¬ 
search from the start of the epi¬ 
demic, and is acknowledged as a 
co-discoverer of HIV in 1983. He 
is actively searching for a vaccine. 
Under the auspices of the ARI, he 
has organized a campus-wide ef¬ 
fort on vaccine research. 

Coates, ARI’s director, will pre¬ 
sent this year’s accomplishments 
of the institute as well as the vi¬ 
sion for 1999. UCSF created ARI 
last year in recognition of its 
obligations to the city of San 
Francisco, the U.S., and the world 
to work as hard and effectively as 
it can to forge significant scientif¬ 
ic advances in preventing, under¬ 
standing, and treating HIV infec- 


athletes together in one place,” 
particularly gay guys, since he de¬ 
scribed his experience in colle¬ 
giate volleyball at San Francisco’s 
City College as “very homopho¬ 
bic. There’s a big difference with 
NAGVA.” 

Evans put it sweetly. “It’s like a 
family.” He did stress that Godzil¬ 
la and other NAGVA players don’t 
go into competition “as a gay 
team. We don’t walk in say, ‘Hi, 
we’re gay. Look at us.’ But eventu¬ 
ally they find out we’re gay.” 

Evans did note that there have 
been few problems, other than the 
usual steam being let off when 
straight teams discover their gay 
opponents can play just as hard, if 
not harder. One of GAPA’s trans¬ 
gender players got some harass¬ 
ment, Evans said, “until she spiked 
the ball down on their face.” 

That adds a whole new dimen¬ 
sion to “wrist action.” T

Plays from 
‘Pieces of the Quilt’ 

The Artists Alliance Against 
AIDS (AAAA), the umbrella orga¬ 
nization for Pieces of the Quilt, 
and the Jon Sims Center for the 
Performing Arts present plays 
from Pieces of the Quilt, directed 
by Danny Scheie, on World AIDS 
Day at 7:30 p.m. at Metropolitan 
Community Church, 150 Eureka 
Street, between 18th and 19th 
streets in the Castro. There is no 
admission fee, but a $5-$ 10 dona¬ 
tion is suggested. No one will be 
turned away for lack of funds. 

The event includes perfor¬ 
mances of plays written specifi¬ 
cally for Pieces of the Quilt, in¬ 
cluding A Prayer by Tony Kushn- 
er, Wednesday’s Child by Migdalia 
Cruz, and The Big Quilt by direc¬ 
tor Scheie. These three plays will 
be performed by University of 
California at Santa Cruz actors 
from the school’s fall production. 
The last work of the evening is 
Collingwood Park 94114: Volun¬ 
teers, by Alan Quismurio, and will 
be performed by members of 
AAAA’s Emerging Playwrights 
program. 

The performance follows a 6 
p.m. memorial service presented 
by MCC-SF in conjunction with 
World AIDS Day, At 7:15 p.m., 
classical pianist Manual Martinez 
will play contemplative music in 
honor of those who have died and 
those currently in the struggle 
against AIDS. The community is 
welcome to attend. 

AAAA is an AIDS service orga¬ 
nization dedicated to bringing be¬ 
fore the public theater that en¬ 
hances AIDS awareness. Pieces.of

plays and monologues based on 
AIDS themes by leading Ameri¬

For people who have been 
monitoring at labs that use tech¬

less sensitive tests, baselines would 
have to be redrawn if they have to

ACT UP/East Bay demo 

The politically inclined are en¬ 
couraged to take the short drive 
or BART ride over to Oakland at 5 
p.m. Tuesday, for ACT UP/East 
Bay’s annual World AIDS Day 
candlelight vigil. This year it will 
take place in front of the Alameda 
County Administration building, 
to demand that the county fund 
needle exchange. John Iversen, 
with ACT UP/East Bay, said the 
group will also have its annual 
“selective raffle” sheet, where peo¬ 
ple can choose which prizes they’d 
like to win and purchase tickets 
for $1 each. The drawing takes 
place December 8 and people 
need not be present to win. 

Speakers at the vigil will in¬ 
clude a variety of East Bay politi¬ 
cians, religious, and health offi¬ 
cials, including Maudelle Shirek, 
Berkeley’s vice mayor; Kriss Wor¬ 
thington, Berkeley’s openly gay 
city councilmember; John Russo 
and Nate Miley, both Oakland city 
councilmembers; Bunny Knuck¬ 
les, from Women Organized to 
Respond to Life Threatening Dis¬ 
eases; Bongane Nyathi of McGee 
Avenue Baptist Church; Jan 
Gilbrecht, from Alameda County 
Needle Exchange; and representa¬ 
tives from the California Nurses 
Association. 

The county building is located 
at 1221 Oak Street, just a few 
blocks away from the Lake Merritt 
BART station. For more informa¬

Web channel launched 

For World AIDS Day, the non¬ 
profit Immunet is launching its 
new AIDS-dot-ORG web address: 
www.aids.org, making it easier for 
PWAs to stay informed. The web¬ 
site is the result of new AIDS ther- 


worth of my two cents, I realize 
that I’m still asking many of the 
same questions: In a world where 
race still matters and socioeco¬ 
nomic factors determine a great 
deal, how can being gay, lesbian, 
bisexual, or transgender bind us or 
blind us? What information about 
our lives is available to us and to 
others? How are we discussed in 
schools, in the news, in entertain¬ 
ment, and in literature? Why do 
we treat our dogs and cats so well? 

It’s always worth a wider per¬ 
spective too. What life would Alice 
and Freda be living today? Would 
they have competed in the Gay 
Games? Would they have dropped 
out of high school due to the ha¬ 
rassment only to be living on the 
streets? Would they be guests on 
Geraldo ? Might they sign on to the 
gay speakers bureau in Memphis? 
Would Alice drink too much? 
Would Freda work on Wall Street? 
Would they be fighting for the 


the Chiron DNA tests, and coun¬ 
ty labs will have to covert to the 
Roche technology and retrain 
staff. This may cause some delays 
and will certainly have a cost im¬ 
pact on county labs not using the 
older version of the Roche tech¬ 
nology. The companies and a 
number of prominent researchers 
have lined up against this recom¬ 
mendation, so it may be averted. 
The results will be reported in the 
Federal Register with an opportu¬ 
nity for public comment. 

Certainly, we must pressure 
the companies developing these 


apies giving new life to thousands 
and providing quality treatment 
information to people. 

“People worldwide will easily 
find critical HIV and AIDS infor¬ 
mation by simply typing ‘aids.org’ 
in any Internet web browser,” said 
Mark F. Johnson, president and 
founder of AIDS-dot-ORG/Im- 
munet. 

Added Gary Schaff, director of 
communications for Immunet, 
“AIDS-dot-ORG is the logical 
starting point for finding AIDS 
treatment information on the 
web. We invite other information 
providers and AIDS organizations 
to work with is, so that everyone 
can benefit from the easy to re¬ 
member ‘aids.org’ web address.” 

AIDS-dot-ORG includes the 
respected AIDS Treatment News 
archive, accredited continuing 
medical education (CME), Direct 
AIDS Alternative Information Re¬ 
sources (DAAIR), the Immunet 
AIDS bookstore, with over 3,000 
titles, independent AIDS book re¬ 
views, medical conference listings 
and abstracts, a resource directo¬ 
ry, hotline phone numbers, and 
links to quality information on 
other websites. 

Immunet has enjoyed im¬ 
mense popularity since launching 
the first on-line accredited CME 
programs on AIDS treatment in 
1996, and was the first to offer on¬ 
line CMEs in an interactive 
audio-visual format. On only 
three years, Immunet has received 
almost nine million hits from 
over 140 countries. 

Founded in 1993, Immunet is 
a nonprofit organization dedicat¬ 
ed to harnessing the power of the 
Internet in the battle against 
HIV/AIDS. As a nonprofit, Im¬ 
munet can assure that its AIDS- 
dot-ORG outlet provides unbi¬ 
ased information. “The answer to 
AIDS lies in a thousand pieces,” 
Johnson said, “and if we can con¬ 
nect those pieces, we can find a 
cure for HIV and AIDS. Nothing 
is more important in the fight 
against AIDS than building a 
community dedicated to the free 
and open exchange of informa¬ 
tion and alternatives.” T 


right to adopt, looking for a 
sperm donor, or raising Jack Rus¬ 
sell terriers? Would their relatives 
still object to their relationship? 
Would they be beaten up and left 
by the side of a Memphis road, 
dismissable as a pair of scarecrows 
to the first bicyclist passing by? 

It’s hard to know. But it’s easy to 
see that we have to keep asking the 
questions. We have to keep think¬

for HCFA to deny the underin¬

9°tte 1 PROPERTY FOR SALE 

after four years 


by Mark Norby 


1 San Francisco gay man 
JfJ! charges that police investi- 
b gators no longer care about 
Thomas (Tommy) Wenger, a 
troubled young man who occa¬ 
sionally hustled on Polk Street 
and became the victim of a gris¬ 
ly murder in 1994. Gary King, 
who was instrumental from the 
beginning in providing authori¬ 
ties with information about the 
homicide, believes he has more 
crucial data that could reveal 
who may be the killer. 

The San Francisco Police De¬ 
partment (SFPD), however, has 
not been forthcoming in re¬ 
sponding. 

King fears that the investiga¬ 
tion will cease because Wenger - 
without bereaved family and 
friends who might otherwise 
provide impetus to the police de¬ 
partment to continue its investi¬ 
gation - was a penniless, cocaine- 
addicted gay hustler. The last 
King has heard from the depart¬ 
ment was in February, he says. 
Since then, his calls have been 


rental records will give the name 
and may indicate where the per¬ 
son is to be located. 

Four years is too long 

The rental records, however, 
may have already been destroyed, 
the Bay Area Reporter has 
learned. In a phone call to Trini¬ 
ty Towers management office, a 
records officer explained that 
records are “usually kept for a 
six-month period. After that they 
are transferred to the corporate 
office and from there they may 
be kept or destroyed.” 

King wonders, “If they do 
have the records - which they 
should have in any case if they re¬ 
ally have been investigating from 
the beginning - why haven’t they 
released the information? 

“It should not take [nearly] 
five years for San Francisco po¬ 
lice to'identify and talk with the 
roommate of Tommy Wenger.” 

All that is known about the 
occupant of the apartment, ac¬ 
cording to King, is that he match¬ 
es similar descriptions of one of 
two men last seen before 
Wenger’s murder, and that he 


“It should not take five years 
for the police to identify and talk 
with the roommate of Wenger ”

channeled to the voicemail boxes 
of SFPD Investigators Mike 
Johnson and Alex Fagan, and 
have not been returned. 

A dumpster diver found 
Wenger’s body March 28, 1994, 
in separate plastic garbage bags 
in a trash receptacle in Myrtle 
Alley, between Polk and Larkin 
streets. The victim had been 
beaten, burned, and strangled, 
then decapitated and dismem¬ 
bered. The body had been 
drained of all blood by way of 
deep slashes to the wrists. 

King insists that shortly be¬ 
fore the homicide, he accompa¬ 
nied Wenger to an apartment in 
the Trinity Towers apartment 
building adjacent to the alley. 
That, he believes, is where the 
killing and dismembering took 
place. “The body was found three 
feet from an exit out of Trinity 
Towers,” he points out, “and [the 
dumpster was located] almost di¬ 
rectly below the apartment 
Tommy was staying in.” 

He says he has provided de¬ 
tailed information to the police, 
both about the apartment’s loca¬ 
tion and Wenger’s apparent 
roommate, and complains that 
detectives are not moving for¬ 
ward with the information. 

“The inspectors said back in 
February that they would obtain 
the rental records,” he says, “and 
told me not to do anything more 
[in the case].” 

King says the records at the 
Trinity Towers apartments “tell 
information about who was liv¬ 
ing in that apartment.” 

If the occupant of the apart¬ 
ment at Trinity Towers matches 
the descriptions by both King 
and the investigative department, 


may have been a medical student 

The last point is important 
because, as police reports con¬ 
firm, the body was probably sur¬ 
gically dismembered. The other 
factor is the draining of the 
body’s blood, a procedure that 
would likely be used by “some¬ 
one in the medical profession,” 
according to the initial investiga¬ 
tive reports. 

One other possible suspect in 
the case, albeit briefly, was Eng* 
lishman Martin Scripps, who was 
convicted of several murders in 
different countries in similar 
fashion to the Wenger case. In the 
early spring of 1995, police re¬ 
leased information to the press 
about Scripps, who had learned 
butchery techniques in a prison 
work rehabilitation program. 
Scripps is no longer under suspi¬ 
cion in the Wenger case, however, 
since his travel schedule put him 
halfway around the world from 
Polk Street at the time of the 
killing. 

King says he now believes that 
if he had not learned of the mur¬ 
der and taken an active role in 
solving the case, he could have 
ended up with a similar fate as 
Wenger. His role in the case has 
helped him change his life for the 
better, he says. 

And, despite the frustrations 
surrounding this case, he asks 
anyone with further information 
or those interested in the murder 
of Wenger to contact Investiga¬ 
tors Mike Johnson and Alex 
Fagan at the SFPD investigations 
department at (415) 553-1145. 

Calls from the B.A.R. to the 
SFPD Department of Investiga¬ 
tions were not returned by press 
time. ▼

Will what makes sense 


still make sense 


As we enter a new era in the treatment of HIV infection, the 
focus is shifting toward managing the disease over the long 
term. While early, aggressive therapy with a combination of 
potent antiretrovirals makes sense virologically, it poses 
serious questions for patients living with the disease. 

Many who do well initially on combination therapy find 
themselves unable to tolerate treatment or adhere to rigorous 
schedules. Or the virus grows resistant to available drugs. 

Some answers will come from new, potent therapies that 
are more convenient to take, easier to tolerate, and can be 
readily combined with other antiretroviral drugs. 

But new therapies will raise other questions: Which drugs to 
use first? Which will give maximum response up front, yet still 
preserve future options? And will those future options be 
potent enough to give patients a "second" first chance? 

Glaxo Wellcome is committed to developing new long¬ 
term strategies, as well as new therapies, for clinicians and 
patients alike. Together, we can continue to change the way 
people think about treating HIV... today and tomorrow.

Vol. 28 • No. 48 • 26 November 1998 




by Gary Morris 


T here aren’t many art forms where 
commercial success is consistently 
equated with aesthetic worth. In 
painting, the idea that Walter Keane 
is a better artist than Picasso would 
be laughingly dismissed. And anyone claim¬ 
ing that Sidney Sheldon’s spew outranks the 
work of William Faulkner might invite cen¬ 
sure, or even impeachment. Among the 
major arts, it’s only in film that popular 
hacks — Steven Spielberg foremost among 
them — merit innumerable awards, miles of 
media exposure, and armiesof imitators try¬ 
ing to re-create both their standfhg and their 
success. This distressing cultural trend has 
resulted in some serious cinematic casual¬ 
ties; the most notable may be the work of 
French director Robert Bresson. 

Bresson, born in 1901, is a true anomaly 
even by the exacting standards of intransigent 
auteurs a la Sternberg or Carl Dreyer. A 
“Christian atheist” by his own paradoxical de¬ 
scription, he began directing feature films in 
1943 with Les Anges du peche (Angels of Sin),

but only made a total of 13 during the next 
40 years. His sources were almost invariably 
classical — Diderot, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, 
Bernanos — but his radical reinterpretations 
of the material frequently made it almost un¬ 
recognizable. A superb manipulator of nar¬ 
rative incident, he focused increasingly on 
slight, seemingly irrelevant details in the 
story, often obscuring or hiding major plot 
twists. A master director of actors, he refused 
to use them after his first two films, turning 
instead to what he perversely called “models” 
— amateurs that he ruthlessly rehearsed to 
rid them of any traces of theatricality. Even 
the standard running time of a feature could 
be cast aside; his 1962 version of the life of 
Joan of Arc runs a mere 65 minutes. 

Sowing seeds 

Bresson’s early films are stylized melo¬ 
dramas with the luminous look of French 
poetic realism. The second of these, Les 
Dames du Bois de Boulogne (1945), was

D epending on your point of view, Joan Crawford- 
as-mother has been either accurately portrayed 
or unjustly demonized by her eldest daughter 
Christina. Although another of Crawford’s chil¬ 
dren, Cathy, has publicly refuted her sister’s ver¬ 
sion of life with mother in Mommie Dearest, the image of 
Faye Dunaway as the abusive Joan has become a camp 
icon. That image has inspired Artful! Circle Theatre’s an¬ 
nual production of Christmas with the Crawfords, which 
opens tomorrow at the Lorraine Hansberry Theatre. 

Whatever the truth of the real Crawford-as-mom, her 
real-life image is above reproach. In her nearly fifty-year 
career, Joan seldom played mommies, dearest or other¬ 
wise. Stars of her era were expected to be glamorous and 
beautiful-, and Joan excelled at both. Motherhood was not 
considered an image enhancer. 

Hence, Joan’s first foray into screen maternity coincid¬ 
ed with her well-publicized adoption of Christina and did- ~ 
n’t come until 1940’s Susan and God. At the time, Craw¬ 
ford had temporarily halted a career decline with 1939’s 
The Women, the first of three films she did for openly gay 
director George Cukor, and was looking for better parts. 
After being MGM’s top female box-office draw from 
1930-1936, she experienced a drop in popularity blamed 
on poor films with formulaic plots. 

Susan and God, helmed by Cukor, was taken from 
Rachel Crother’s hit Broadway play starring Gertrude 
Lawrence. The first half of the film is witty, as is Joan’s per¬ 
formance as a well-meaning society matron drawn to a re¬ 
ligious cult. In her efforts to do good, she neglects the emo¬ 
tional needs of her husband (Frederic March) and shy, mal¬ 
adjusted teenage daughter (Rite Quigley). In the second 
half, when she turns her attention to them and gives up her 
fatuous religion, the film sinks. But the image of Crawford 
as a mother who may not be perfect but who does what is

From bell bottoms to bugle beads 



Cher's early innocence captured many a young gay man's heart. 


Thanks for Chering 


by John R. Killacky 


"<£ efore Woodstock and the 
Summer of Love, an overly 

' mascaraed teeny-bopper 
waif came into my life singing to 
her shaggy-haired partner in a 
bobcat vest about love prevailing 
against a cruel and unjust world: 
“They say we’re young and we 
don’t know/ We won’t find out 
until we grow/ Well, I don’t know 
if all that’s true/ ’Cause you got 
me, and baby, I got you ... babe.” 

That summer of 1965, Sonny 
and Cher were bigger than the 
Beatles. “I Got You Babe” sold 
three million copies, and they 
charted three other singles simul¬ 
taneously. I was thirteen, bought 
my first album, and left the crew- 
cut behind. 

Their hippie image waned be¬ 
fore long, but the star-crossed cou¬ 
ple reinvented themselves for the 
70s with Las Vegas shtick, and they 
ruled Sunday night television in a 
variety series known more for its 
costumes than for anything else. At 
the conclusion of every show, the 
all-too-glamorous/fabulous Cher 
would gaze into her goofy Sven- 
gali’s eyes and sing adoringly: 
“Then put your little hand in 
mine/ There ain’t no hill or moun¬ 
tain we can’t climb ... babe.” 


Cher filled for divorce in 1974, 
however, citing involuntary servi¬ 
tude. The tabloids detailed Sonny 
and Cher’s acrimonious split, and 
each tried to establish separate ca¬ 
reers over the next decade. Sonny 
dabbled with acting, restaurant 
ownership, and eventually poli¬ 
tics. Cher juggled singing, in¬ 
fomercials, and being taken seri¬ 
ously as an actress. Despite the 
bitterness of all their legal tussles, 
Cher appeared at the openings of 
his latest restaurant ventures, and 
they came together on David Let- 
terman’s talk show in 1988 as she 
campaigned for her Oscar and he 
to become mayor of Palm Spring. 
Strangely, after working so hard to 
distance themselves in the public’s 
mind, they reprised “I Got You 
Babe” once more: “And when I’m 
sad, you’re a clown/ And if I get 
scared, you’re always around.” . 

This was the last time they per¬ 
formed together, but it was not 
the last time they revisited their 
signature hit. Sonny performed it 
later that year, dueting with their 
daughter Chastity. In 1993, Cher 
introduced it to another genera¬ 
tion on MTV, covering the song 
with the animated adolescent 
characters Beavis and Butt-Head. 

“I Got You Babe” had one final 
curtain call this year after Sonny’s 
fatal skiing accident. The funeral 


was broadcast live as Cher eulo¬ 
gized her former husband and 
singing partner. Last May, she put 
together a television special on 
their early years together as they 
went from bell bottoms to bugle 
beads, all the while singing: “I got 
you to walk with me/1 got you to 
talk with me/ I got you to kiss 
goodnight/ I got you to hold me 
tight.” 

Lately, we have been hearing 
even more from Cher as she pro¬ 
motes her new book The First 
Time (Simon 8c Schuster) and the 
sizzling dance-till-you-drop single 
“Believe” (already in the top ten in 
England, Denmark, Austria, and 
Germany) from her new Warner 
Bros, album of the same name. 
Buzz has also grown around her 
performance in Franco Zeffirelli’s 
autobiographical costume opus set 
in pre-World War II Italy, Tea with 
Mussolini. Yet no matter how many 
incarnations her career takes, I will 
always remember her as that 
young innocent girl hanging on to 
Sonny for all her life: “I got you I 
won’t let go/1 got you to love me 
so/ I got you babe/ Repeat To 
Fade...” ▼

Come together 

A chat with Andrew Sullivan 


by Dan Blue 


: hen I met Andrew Sulli¬ 
van, he was dressed in a 
If plaid sport shirt just like 
the one he had worn the previous 
night at an MGC service. It was 
also the shirt he wore on a recent 
broadcast of Charlie Rose. Maybe 
he just had a laundry shortage, 
but the shirt seemed a statement, 
especially on Charlie Rose, where 
men prefer a coat and tie. After 
five years facing death from HIV, 
Sullivan didn’t have to dress up. 

He came across instead as un¬ 
affected and utterly human. When 
the interviewer arrived at his hotel 


room, he had ordered tea and of¬ 
fered some cookies that a cousin 
had sent from England. Sullivan 
clearly savored those cookies and 
didn’t press twice when the guest 
refused. Stocky and balding — a 
cross between Phil Collins and a 
young Bob Hoskins — he seemed 
happy in his body. The two had 
gone through hard times together 
and were friends. His eyes, while 
not large, were sensitive and so 
deep they seemed enormous. 

Sullivan had given a reading at 
MCC the night before and was 
still moved by the audience re¬ 
sponse. The selection he had cho¬ 
sen came from his new book, Love

A melancholy spirit 

The Last Emperor closely ex¬ 
amines the life of the last 
Manchurian emperor, Pu Yi, who 
came to power at the age of three 
in 1908 and ruled, mostly as a fig¬ 
urehead, until 1924, when he was 
ousted by communist insurrec¬ 
tionists. The film deftly under¬ 
scores the melancholy spirit of a 
young man who wants only to live 
a normal life, like other people, 
but is mostly a prisoner in his 
own palace, a captive of sniveling 
servants and snooping sycophants 
who gain enormously from his 
status as a mere symbol of China’s 
powerful Imperial past. When Pu 
Yi is finally forced out of his 1000- 
room palace, it’s his maiden voy¬ 
age into the real world, and one 
senses how ill-equipped he is for 
such a trip. 

With wife and mistress in tow, 
Pu Yi flees to Teintsin, where he 
adopts the decadent lifestyle of a 
ne’er-do-well, chain-smoking 
dandy who changes his name to 
Henry and learns to dance the jit¬ 
terbug. Though not wanting for 


dence of Vittorio Storaro’s genius. 
In a film of this length and com¬ 
plexity, there’s the risk of bloat, of 
too many details adding up to a 
mere history lesson, yet while the 
film doesn’t entirely avoid over¬ 
simplification, Storaro’s camera 
never fails to get underneath the 
surface of things to tell a story that 
could never be told by words 
alone. He gives new meaning to 
the line “visually sumptuous.” See 
it for yourself. Films don’t get 
much better than this. ▼

/ " ernardo Bertolucci has al¬ 
ways specialized in epic 
filmmaking, movies that are 
longer, more expensive, and big¬ 
ger in every way than anybody 
else’s (at least in Europe). Fre¬ 
quently his pictures have been at¬ 
tractive twaddle, like Last Tango in 
Paris, Luna, and the recent Steal¬ 
ing Beauty, but more often than 
not they’ve been elaborate forays 
into politics and psychology, a 
vantage point from which he has 
occasionally extrapolated to make 
sometimes remarkable, some¬ 
times overwrought statements 
about the human condition. Be¬ 
fore the Revolution (1964) and The 
Spider’s Stratagem (1970) fall into 
the latter category, but The Con¬ 
formist (1971), a disturbing film 
that tries to get into the head of a 
man hired by Italian Fascists to 
murder his former professor in 
France, is likely to be remembered 
as one of the most important 
films to emerge from Europe in 
the postwar period (it’s adapted 
from a novel by Alberto Moravia). 

Bertolucci’s concern with pol¬ 
itics, with the organization of so¬ 
ciety and its effects on the indi¬ 
vidual, is hardly surprising. He 
did come of age, after all, in Eu¬ 
rope in the 1940s, when it seemed 
an entire continent was plunged 
into war and genocide as the re¬ 
sult of one man’s folly. What is 
amazing, though, is Bertolucci’s 
stick-with-itness for a type of film 
that other directors of his genera¬ 
tion have forsaken for more pop¬ 
ular entertainments. His fluffier 
endeavors aside, Bertolucci has re¬ 
mained consistently high-mind¬ 
ed. In 1976 came 1900, a six-hour 
epic that tells the stories of two 
Italian families — one rich, one 
poor— in the first half of the 
20th century, and ten years later 
he turned his cameras from West 
to East with The Last Emperor, a 
colossal financial and artistic un¬ 
dertaking written and directed by 
Bertolucci and photographed by 
Vittorio Storaro. The film’s origi¬ 
nal running time was a whopping 
three and a half hours, which 
Bertolucci then shortened by oue 
hour. The excised footage has now 


a changed man. It’s a sprawling 
story, one that shows nothing less 
than a man’s journey from privi¬ 
lege to disenfranchisement, from 
delusion to reality. 

The restored version of The 
Last Emperor offers little in the 
way of new plot twists, characters 
or endings, but there are several 
new scenes, and many existing 
ones have been expanded, giving 
the film greater coherence and 
purpose. The additional connec¬ 
tive tissue also humanizes the 
adult, post-imperial Pu Yi (John 
Lone), who seemed strangely trun¬ 
cated in the earlier version. But the 
real benefit of the director’s cut is 
that it furnishes additional evi- 


Bertolucci's The Last Emperor 


fleeting pleasures, Pu Yi doesn’t 
much like being marginal, so he 
eagerly accepts an invitation from 
Japanese potentates to become 
emperor in the Japan-controlled 
state of Manchuria, a puppet 
regime not unlike the one into 
which he was born. What follows 
is his capture by Russian armed 
forces after Japan’s surrender in 
1945, his internment in a Chinese 
re-education camp, and his even¬ 
tual release from prison in 1960 as

Jazz-tinted vocals 


Interview with jazz vocalist and pianist Andy Bey 



Andy Bey 


by Gregg Shapiro 

nding a more than twenty- 
; 7 year silence in recorded 

music, jazz vocalist and pi¬ 
anist Andy Bey returned in a big 
way two years ago with his well- 
received Ballads, Blues & Bey CD. 
Not letting too much time go by, 
the openly gay Bey has followed 
up that CD with the remarkable 
Shades Of Bey (both Evi¬ 
dence/12th Street Records), on 
which he effortlessly combines the 
work of established jazz com¬ 
posers (Ellington and Strayhorn, 
Thelonious Monk) with those 
whom you might not expect to 
find on an album of jazz vocals 
(Comden and Green, Marilyn and 
Alan Bergman, Nick Drake), for 
one of the great listening experi¬ 
ences of this year, and years to 
come. 

Gregg Shapiro: Like Hollywood, 
in recent years, the world of jazz 
performers appears to be slowly 
opening the closet door. The pres¬ 
ence of openly gay male jazz per¬ 
formers (including Fred Hersch 
and Michael Feinstein) on the 
charts and on the scene (such as 
Steven Kowalczyk and Ian Shaw) 
is increasing in dribs and drabs. 
How does it feel to be in such 
good company? 

Andy Bey: The [gay] label... I’m 
not saying that it’s bad. It’s great. 
But why not just be a musician?

Sure, whatever it is, if we’re gay, 
we’re gay. I don’t know. It doesn’t 
disturb me that people say I’m a 
gay musician, but I’d rather they 
just say I’m a musician, and let it 
be self-explanatory. When you 
start getting into labels and 
things, sometimes that... well, it 
doesn’t take away anything, be¬ 
cause you are what you are, even if 
they call you a sissy behind closed 
doors, you’re still a sissy to a lot of 
them. You don’t say “heterosexual 
musician” or “lesbian actress.” 

Right. But it really does seem to 
be a given that a lot of performers 
are straight unless they indicate 
otherwise. It just seems like, par¬ 
ticularly with jazz, it is kind of a 
-straight guys club. 

It’s very homophobic. A very macho 
kind of music to be a part of. 

As a well-respected and admired 
interpreter of other people's 
songs, can you tell me something 
about your process of choosing 
material for your albums or live 
performances? 

For this latest CD ( Shades Of Bey), 
my producer sent a lot of tunes to 
me. Of course, I have to like them. 
He just happens to have the taste 
to send me good material. I’m one 
that likes to pick obscure material 
anyway, even though I do a lot of 
the American popular standards. 
I’m one that always looks for 
tunes that haven’t been done by a 
lot of people. For Shades Of Bey, 
my producer sent me stuff by 
Nick Drake, who I’d never heard 
of, the “River Man” tune. As well 
as “Drume Negrita,” which was a 
melody that I’d heard years ago, 
it’s an Afro-Cuban folk melody. 

I had no idea what he was 
going to send me. And then we 
just started sending each other 
tapes. He would send me tapes, 
and I would try to work on a little 
arrangement and send them back. 
Then one thing lead to another. 
We did this for about a year before 
we started recording. We record¬ 
ed “River Man” and “Drume 
Negrita” first. Then we had quite 
a few months off before we fin¬ 
ished the rest of the CD, because 
we were still waiting on getting 
some of the songs together. I did a 
lot of the arranging for some of 
the tunes. That’s the result. 


Do songwriters send songs direct¬ 
ly to you? 

They’ve always sent me music. 
Obscure and not well-known 
writers. I’m a songwriter, as well. 
We’ll probably do more of my 
material eventually, do a CD of it. 
People have come to me, in the 
past... there’s so much music. 

Is there a song that you sing you 
wish you had written? 

That could be many. There’s this 
one song that I got from a fake- 
book, which was written by 
Richard Rodgers’ daughter Mary 
Rodgers. It’s called “Hey Love.” It’s 
from a Broadway show called Hot 
Spot, which starred judy Holliday, 
I think back in the sixties. When I 
found the music in a fakebook I 
had back in the sixties, I said, “I 
like this title.” As I started singing 
the melody, I just loved the chord 
structure and I loved the melody. 
I’ve been doing it since maybe the 
late sixties. I recorded it on a.CD 
that I did when I was overseas, in 
Yugoslavia. I hope to do another 
version of it. A lot of singers that 
have heard it really love the tune, 
in fact, they want to do it. Maybe 
they are doing it by now. 

Have you begun to select songs 
for your next album? 

Not right now. We’re really just 
focusing on this record ( Shades Of 
Bey). It’s getting a lot of attention. 
In the first week that it was out, it 
was picked by 115 stations, as the 
number one CD. Since that time, 
maybe 18 more stations have been 
added on. We’ve been moving up. 
We moved up in the Gavin Report 
to 35 from 200. It’s getting a nice 
reaction. 

After having spent a lot of time 
overseas, in how many languages 
would you consider yourself to be 
fluent? 

I’m not fluent in any of them 
[laughs]. I taught four months out 
of the year in Austria, as a guest 
professor, working with singers. I 
know very little German. I spent 
seven months [performing] with 
my sisters in Paris. I couldn’t speak 
the language, but I was able to pick 
up things. I was able to buy food. 
The basic stuff. Call a cab. Y

Keyboard sensualist Jon Nakamatsu 

Roll over the Beethoven 


by Timothy Pfaff 

t wasn’t until Jon Nakamatsu 

launched into the second sec¬ 
tion of his Berkeley recital on 
November 15 — two pieces by 
Chopin — that I remembered 
why I was so eager to catch this 
second local appearance by the 
winner of the last Van Cliburn 
Competition. From the first 
measures of the C-sharp-minor 
Polonaise, Op. 26, No. 1, and 
even more in the composer’s 
early and, if seldom-played, de¬ 
lectable “Grand Fantasy on Pol¬ 
ish Airs,” the pianist’s unselfish 
delight in his own virtuosity 
came to the fore. That’s when I 
remembered that, at a Nakamat¬ 
su recital, I’m having fun when 
he is. 

Behind his best-little-boy-in- 
the-world platform persona is 
an unabashed keyboard sensual¬ 
ist, and it’s his physical as much 
as his mental connection with 
the instrument that brings his 
playing alive. It’s a sine qua non 
for great Chopin playing, and 
Nakamatsu made good on the 
promise of his superb all- 
Chopin second CD for Harmo- 
nia Mundi, with performances 
that were no less assured and al¬ 
luring live. This is not to resur¬ 
rect passe notions that Chopin is 
deficient in sound musical 
thought or, behind the filigree, 
rigorous formal design — or 
that good Chopin is the 
province of feeling rather than 
thinking pianists. But any pi¬ 
anist who doesn’t revel in sheer 
instrumental mastery is missing 
the boat in Chopin, and Naka¬ 
matsu revels, tastefully but un¬ 
mistakably. 

The polonaise pursued a 
seamless arc of unerringly apt 
Chopin rhetoric, but it was the 
Grand Fantasy that found the

pianist in peak form. His supple 
technique — wonderfully even 
and sure, yet supremely relaxed 
— coursed through the endless 
filigree with seeming effortless¬ 
ness, but what distinguished his 
performance was his almost un¬ 
canny knack for picking out the 
salient inner voices in busy 
music. Even better, he caught the 
precise flavor of each of the Pol¬ 
ish airs. 

He repeated the feat even 
more dazzlingly at the end of his 
printed program, when he fol¬ 
lowed an inward-directed, 
supremely well-balanced and 
rather gravely beautiful account 
of Liszt’s “Sonetto 104 del Pe- 
trarca” with a rippling, surging, 
almost uninhibitedly virtuosic 
ride through the “Tarantella” 
from that composer’s Venezia e 
Napoli. The more heavy the 
music’s figuration, the more 
gleeful Nakamatsu’s playing be¬ 
comes, and at the crest of the 
piece’s cascade of notes, the pi¬ 
anist managed a little shoulder 
shrug that said volumes about 
the freedom that comes from 
technique as disciplined as his. 

19th-century man 

Although there are ample 
hints that his is essentially a 
19th-century sensibility, Naka¬ 
matsu did some equally impres¬ 
sive work with two 20th-centu¬ 
ry pieces, Stravinsky’s Four 
Etudes, Op. 7, and William Bol- 
com’s Nine Bagatelles, the latter 
commissioned for the Van 
Cliburn. The pianist mounted 
an exuberant response to the 
Stravinsky’s formidable techni¬ 
cal challenges, dispatching the 
fourth etude’s moto perpetuo 
with almost indecent panache. 
The Bolcom, a character piece, 
elicited keen responses from 
Nakamatsu, who mined “the 
ghost mazurka” for its wit,

“aimai-je un reve” for its echoes 
of Messiaen — and all of the 
bagatelles for their concision of 
expression. 

If Nakamatsu is going to get 
beyond his post-competition 15 
minutes of fame, it will be by 
capitalizing on those very 
virtues, and ditching the compe¬ 
tition-bred fallacy that real pi¬ 
anists eat mixed grille. What two 
local recitals, both sponsored by 
the enterprising Cal Perfor¬ 
mances, have confirmed is that 
Beethoven and Brahms are not 
his fare, not that he can’t take 
them in but that they don’t 
nourish him. The performance 
of Beethoven’s E-Major Sonata, 
Op,. 109, that opened his Sun¬ 
day recital was note-perfect and 
well-groomed, but those are 
hardly the distinguishing quali¬ 
ties of memorable Beethoven. 
Argument, architecture and at 
least an inclination to storm the 
heavens are. 

In the noisy marketplace of 
today’s music business, it must 
be harder than ever for a young 
artist to trust his own tempera¬ 
ment and inclinations. If Naka¬ 
matsu can hear the roar of ap¬ 
proval that filled Zellerbach Hall 
as anything but hometown 
boosterism (the Stanford grad . 
hails from Mountain View), he 
may hear what it is about his 
playing that manifestly touches 
people. The surest way to beat 
the competition is to end the 
Competition. V 



Jon Nakamatsu maintains an unselfish delight in his own virtuosity.

Whitfield’s Plush gig 


Jim Van Buskirk 


hy is it we never seem to 
appreciate the treasures 
in our very own back¬ 
yard? Especially in San Francisco, 
we often wait for local talent to go 
to New York before we realize 
what we had all along. 

If that’s what it takes, fine. 
Wesla Whitfield just returned 
from New York where, in addition 
to performing at the 9th Annual 
Cabaret Convention, she pre¬ 
miered her one-woman show, 
“Life Upon the Wicked Stage” at 
the Kaufmann Theater. Now she’s 
home to present this autobio¬ 
graphical evening at the comfort¬ 
able Plush Room. This is the story 
of her life in which she has “left 
out the boring parts” and “put in 
interesting parts that actually hap¬ 
pened to other people.” It’s quick¬ 
ly obvious that Whitfield is walk¬ 
ing a fine line between sweet sin¬ 
cerity and tongue-in-cheek cyni¬ 
cism, just as she segues between 
inventive jazz phrasings and

cabaret performances of the 
American songbook. 

After an appropriately titled 
instrumental overture of Walter 
Donaldson’s “Did I Remember?” 
performed by bassist Michael 
Moore and Whitfield’s hus¬ 
band/pianist/arranger Mike 
Greensill, Whitfield takes the stage 
to sing a freshly evocative “When 
You Wish Upon a Star.” 

Her short-cropped graying 
hair offset by her mischievously 
twinkling eyes, Whitfield begins 
to recount a-version of her life. 
Born in Santa Maria, 130 miles 
north of Los Angeles, she admits 
to having been called stubborn, 
but prefers to refer to herself as 
“single-minded,” before launch¬ 
ing into a sophisticated interpre¬ 
tation of the Gershwins’ “They All 
Laughed” and dreaming of being 
“On the Other Side of the Tracks.” 

A handful of projected slides 
and a few clever voice-over “inter¬ 
ruptions” help propel her saga, 
like “Some People” intercut with 
“Life Upon the Wicked Stage.” She 
learns the importance of songs as

stories by singing in church, and 
describes her mother in a costume 
made of white bed-sheets illumi¬ 
nated by a blacklight, singing a 
saucy “A Good Man is Hard to 
Find.” Whitfield claims to have 
been a soprano when she was cast 
as Fiona in Brigadoon and “still is 
—- but not in public,” delivering 
an enchanting “Almost Like Being 
in Love.” As member of the San 
Francisco Opera Chorus she 
“learned a great many things” 
watching porno flicks in the men’s 
dressing room. 

Whitfield loved her stint as a 
singing cocktail waitress in a Kurt 
Weill revue at the Old Spaghetti 
Factory. She makes rare reference 
to the incident which, 20 years 
ago, left her unable to walk, but 
did not deter her from her dream 
of singing. She believes it when 
she sings “Lucky to Be Me,” and 
makes you believe it too. Slyly 
sliding her arm across the top of 
the piano, Whitfield subtly swivels 
in her bar chair, each tiny gesture 
of her hands enhancing her per¬ 
fect enunciation and intelligent 
phrasing. Even her wry facial ex¬ 
pressions underscore her pro¬ 
found respect for the lyrics of 
such timeless standards as “Be¬ 
witched, Bothered and Bewil¬ 
dered,” “Lost in the Stars,” and 
“How High the Moon.” After a 
smoky “Don’t Explain,” Wesla 
closes the perfectly-paced show 
with a powerfully poignant “For 
All We Know.”

name, correcting it to the spelling

H e goes by the single, not-especially catchy name, Barnes, 
which hardly conjurs up either queerness or the modem mu¬ 
sical mating ritual in which rock lets electronica explode inside 
it. Yet his bland cognomen belies the power and dynamism of Barnes’ 
new album, Loud Boy Radio (Loud Boy Records, Venice, California; 
1998). In songs ranging from amped-up techno/hip hop to down- 
home ballads, Barnes displays a penchant for composing catchy pop- 
rock tunes, then blowing them up with the latest electronic rhythms 
and razzmatazz. What most distinguishes the album are intelligent 
lyrics and Barnes’ vocals, which combine the dramatics of Freddie 
Mercury, the passion of Eddie Vedder, the mournfulness of Morrisey, 
and the sweetness of Michael Stipe. ▼ _ Mark Mardon

Almost the opera it could be 

Peter Grimes comes up short of perfection 


by Paul Thomason 


J- ^ enjamin Britten’s first 
opera, Peter Grimes, when 
' ' performed at its best, 

ought to leave an audience dev¬ 
astated. People who experience a 
truly good performance should 
have trouble walking out of the 
theater, their minds incapable of 
dwelling on whether or not 
they’re going to drop into Ab¬ 
sinthe for a bite to eat on the way 
home. Indeed there were cheers 
last week at the conclusion of the 
San Francisco Opera’s first 
Grimes in 22 years; nevertheless, 
I felt unmoved -— a first in my 
long history with that remark- 


markable mad scene for unac¬ 
companied tenor, was my heart 
stirred. A Grimes that only en¬ 
gages you at the end is a Grimes 
without a true Grimes. 

Best of the major singers was 
Alan Held as Captain Balstrode. 
His strong baritone voice easily 
dominated the stage, and he cre¬ 
ated a riveting, three-dimension¬ 
al character using remarkably 
few words and gestures. His utter 
authority and identification with 
the role is exactly what has been 
missing in other productions for 
so much of this opera season, so 
his performance was especially 
welcomed. Deborah Riedel’s 
Ellen Orford offered isolated 
moments of good singing, but 


By no means was the 
performance terrible. It possessed 
a refreshing musical and visual 
cohesiveness. From beginning to 
end, it came off professionally... 
But I missed the soul of the work, 
the very reason a company should 
put on an opera in the first place. 


able work. 

Perhaps mine is a curmud¬ 
geonly view; certainly it is a mi¬ 
nority one. By no means was the 
performance terrible. It pos¬ 
sessed a refreshing musical and 
visual cohesiveness. From begin¬ 
ning to end, it came off profes¬ 
sionally. Obviously everyone on 
stage and in the pit fully com¬ 
mitted themselves to doing 
everything possible to realize 
Britten’s intentions to the fullest. 

But I missed the soul of the 
work, the very reason a compa¬ 
ny should put on an opera in the 
first place. 

American tenor Thomas 
Moser made his S.F. Opera debut 
as Grimes, and he must have 
been gratified by the cheers that 
greeted his solo bow. Often, es¬ 
pecially in the more lyric mo¬ 
ments, his voice sounded beauti¬ 
ful. He sang with careful atten¬ 
tion to phrasing, using the words 
and notes to create-a character. 
But for most of the opera, I kept 
wondering: “Why should I care 
about this guy? What’s the 
point?” 

Only in the last act, in the re- 


her lapses in pitch, combined 
with the harsh tone at the top of 
her soprano voice and when she 
sang strongly, severely uncut her 
effectiveness. 

The numerous minor roles 
were almost all strongly cast. In 
particular, John Relyea stood out 
as Hobson, Tammy Jenkins and 
Peggy Kriha Dye as Auntie’s 
Nieces, Stafford Dean as Swal¬ 
low, Catherine Cook as Mrs. 
Sedley, and Matthew Lord as 
Bob Boles. 

In Peter Grimes, as in Boris 
Godounov and Die Meistersinger 
von Nurnberg, the chorus is one 
of the main characters. In fact, 
in Britten’s opera, the chorus is 
second only to the title charac¬ 
ter himself, since the heart of the 
opera is the tension between the 
chorus (the townspeople) and 
Peter Grimes. It would be won¬ 
derful to report that the S.F. 
Opera Chorus sang at the top of 
their form — which is consider¬ 
able. Unfortunately, that was 
only true in the last act. Maybe 
it was my seat next to the wall, 
under the overhang, which 
made both the chorus and or- 




Tenor Thomas Moser and soprano Deborah'Riedel in Britten's Peter Grimes 


chestra sound muffled and dis¬ 
tressingly monochromatic for 
much of the evening. 

Company music director 
Donald Runnicles conducted, 
and he paced the work superbly. 
Loud cheers greeted him when 
he stepped on stage at the end of 
the performance. Carl Toms’s 
sets proved effective, too, espe¬ 
cially Grimes’s hut in Act II. 

Nostalgia buffs and collectors 
of operatic trivia take note: John 
Copley, who staged this revival 
with Herbert Kellner, played the 
non-singing role of Grimes’s ap¬ 
prentice in 1947 when Grimes 
was staged at Covent Garden, di¬ 
rected by Tyron Guthrie. Y

Playwright Jonathan Harvey visits S.F. 


Creating beautiful things

Beautiful Thing playwright Jonathan Harvey 


SEN CLUB!

by Richard Dodds 


eautiful Thing, Jonathan 

• Harvey’s sweet play about 
two teen-age boys falling in 
love, is subtitled “an urban fairy 
tale.” But the British playwright 
says he used the term “fairy tale” 
more for its gay connotations 
than for its implications of a story 
rooted in fantasy. It’s a word play 
that can sometimes lead a direc¬ 
tor down the wrong path. 

“It gets on my nerves a bit,” the 
playwright said during a recent 
interview, “because I intended it 
to be more real. We still have to 
understand how difficult it is for 
these characters to do what they 
do.” 

The Liverpool native was in 
San Francisco recently with his 
boyfriend, Richard Foord,“to take 
in the sights (Haight-Ashbury 
today, Alcatraz tomorrow) and to 
offer up suggestions for the local 
cast and director of Beautiful 
Thing after seeing a preview per¬ 
formance at the New Conservato¬ 
ry Theatre. His notes for director 
Ed Decker were mostly of the 
fine-tuning sort, he said. “I didn’t 
think, ‘Oh, this is a nightmare. 
Where do we start?’ “ 

Harvey, now 30, was a mere 23 
when he wrote Beautiful Thing, a 
play that put his career on the 
fast-track in Britain. He’s had sev¬ 
eral more plays produced in Lon¬ 
don, wrote the screenplay for the 
film version of Beautiful Thing, 
created a “rude and saucy” sitcom 
for^the B,B.C, B i|working on a mu- 
sicafwith the Pet Shop Bdys, and 
has been introduced to the 
Queen. (“I was a little bit tipsy, 
and kept touching her,” he said. 
“She didn’t seem to mind.”) Two 
days before he left for San Fran¬ 
cisco, his newest play, Guiding 
Star, opened at the prestigious 
Royal National Theatre. 

The reviews of the new play, 
about the ramifications on one 
family of a famous soccer tragedy, 
have been mostly positive, Harvey 
said. “The critics are relieved that 
I’m not seeing everything through 
rose-colored glasses.” 

That was the early rap on Har¬ 
vey, especially after Beautiful 
Thing became a mainstream suc¬ 
cess that managed to unite gay 
and straight audiences and pro¬ 
gressive and conservative critics.

“But you’re never going to get 700 
people a night in a West End the¬ 
ater without straight audiences,” 
he said. “I don’t want to play to 
only five queens in the,front row 
with mustaches.” 

What he did want to do was 
create a play that was life-affirm¬ 
ing while at the same time taking 
an unspoken jab at Britain’s anti¬ 
quated age-of-consent laws for 
gay males. “The rules were mostly 
written by conservative lawmak¬ 
ers who associated what they saw 
at boarding school after lights out 
with gay love,” Harvey said. “I 
wanted a story about falling in 
love rather than just getting laid.” 

He was also rebelling against 
what he calls “the Merchant-Ivory 
version of gay love which didn’t 
relate to my life as working class,” 
he said. “I though there was room 
for the other side of the coin.” 

Tapping into his own experi¬ 
ences growing up in Liverpool, 
and as a young teacher working in 
a rough section of South London, 
he crafted his tale of two teen-age 
boys who live next door to each 
other in a low-income housing 
project. As they deal with difficult 
home lives, these two mates find 
their friendship turning to affec¬ 
tion and then to starry-eyed first 
love as the music of Mama Cass 
seals their kiss. “You emerge feel¬ 
ing,” wrote the critic for the Lon¬ 
don Independent, “as if you’ve just 
been immersed up to the eye¬ 
brows in a vat of totally unsyn¬ 
thetic charm.” 

Harvey himself came out at 18, 
finding at first more sympathy 
from his father, a postman- 
turned-social worker, than from 


his mother, a family-planning 
nurse. “At the time it was very 
scary,” he said. “There were tears 
and silence, which can be worse 
than a big row.” 

Harvey realized that matters 
had finally improved when he and 
his boyfriend visited his parents’ 
home a few years ago and saw that 
his mother had pushed together 
the two single beds in his old bed¬ 
room. “Now I think it’s gone too 
far,” he said. “My mother buys us 
the same things for Christmas. It 
isn’t fair.” 

It was his mother who first 
sent young Jonathan off to a 
youth theater program in Liver¬ 
pool. “I was a big show-off,” he 
said, “and she wanted to channel 
that.” When he was eight, he was 
cast as the coroner of Munchkin- 
land in a production of The Wiz¬ 
ard of Oz. “I was the only one in 
the cast who did an American ac¬ 
cent, which showed how profes¬ 
sional I was.” 

But at 14, a bad case of acne 
caused him to quit performing. 
He turned to writing, and his first 
play was produced at a young 
writers’ festival when he was 17. 
He also won the thousand-pound 
top prize. 

“If I’ve got a gift, it’s in writing 
dialogue,” Harvey said. “I’m inter¬ 
ested in how people speak, and I 
think I’m quite good at observing 
people’s souls.” ▼ 


Beautiful Thing, “an urban 
fairy tale,” will run at the New 
Conservatory Theatre through 
Jan. 2. Tickets are $16 and

discover what he really feels and 
knows. “It requires a kind of ac¬ 
tive loneliness. I’m going some¬ 
where and I’m going to come 
back, but I have to be by myself to 
figure out what I think is true or 
not true.” 

Extraordinary ordeal 

Sullivan often found such soli¬ 
tude nearly unbearable when 
working on the plague passages of 
Love Undetectable. “This book was 
an extraordinary ordeal to write. 
I used to put on very loud music 
so that part of my mind would be 
occupied somewhere else.” 

He found it particularly diffi¬ 
cult to write about sex. “Anyone

Undetectable, and described a dif¬ 
ficult passage through doubt, 
faith, and loss. While reading, he 
had been flooded by memories, 
and at the same time he sensed in 
the room a resonance of shared 
response coming back like a wave. 
“Everybody in that room had 
been through something similar, 
and I’ve never felt those things in 
a public space, reading.” At one 
point his voice had broken, as 
though he were near tears. 

The morning after, he still 
seemed immersed in that mutual 
response. “I 
think of some¬ 
thing like last 
night as part of 
writing the 
book. Other gay 
men and 

women help me 
understand 
what I’ve writ¬

feedback was 
the more trea¬ 
sured, since he 
composed his 
books in isola¬

plained, “be¬ 
cause you have 
to move out¬ 
side your ex¬

Blonde ambitions; dark passages 

Meg Mackay sings Sondheim; Miya Masaoka explores troubling times 


by Deborah Peifer 


i ’ve been a fan of singer-actor 
I (and now, songwriter, but 

more on that later) Meg 
Mackay for some time, so a 
chance to speak with her is a rare 
treat. We had a chat about her 
current projects recently, but first 
I wanted to know how she started 
singing. 

“My mother told me that I 
sang to her from the crib when I 
was eighteen months old,” she be¬ 
gins, “but my first public perfor¬ 
mance was when I sang “Que sera, 
sera” on a picnic table for my 
mom’s company picnic. I was 
five.” 

Given Mackay’s fondness for 
blonde singers (her latest CD is 
Legally Blonde, her homage to 
great blondes), I think it interest¬ 
ing that she was doing Doris Day 
so early in her career. 

“I’m happy as a blonde. When 
I was a kid and looked in the mir¬ 
ror, I expected to see Doris Day.” 

After college studies in opera, 
Mackay moved to San Francisco, 
but opera jobs were not forth¬ 
coming. 

“Then I was cast in Beach 
Blanket Babylon, which was some 
of the most fun I’ve ever had.” 

A tour in the national compa¬ 
ny of Torch Song Trilogy and a 
stint in And What, Give up Show 
Biz marked her transition to 
singer-actor, and meant she could 
finally give up her day job. Cast in 



Meg Mackay 


the Ethel Merman role in Call Me 
Madam at the New Conservatory 
Theatre Center, Mackay is “so 
lucky to have so much work. Ethel 
Merman created the genre of the 
big belter, and this is the second 
Merman role I’ve done for them.” 

Mackay is also doing a benefit 
with The Phantom of the Opera 
company for The National Brain

can write a lurid tale of adventure. 
It’s more difficult to write about it 
really honestly and to capture the 
complexity of need and difficul¬ 
ty.” Yet such exposure was essen¬ 
tial if sex was to be integrated into 
his full humanity. “Integration is 
what it’s about. And what I’m try¬ 
ing to say in this book is that the 
plague did that.” 

Sullivan contends that the 
plague not only integrated gays 
into society but integrated us in¬ 
ternally. “Isn’t that what we did as 
a community? We were all in it 
together. The dead and alive were 
part of each other. And now those 
of us who are still alive are up 
again breathing, and what are we 
going to do with that?” 

The phone rang, and although 
Sullivan answered briefly, he 
seemed less introspective when he 
returned to the interview. He now 
spoke of the hostility his work 
sometimes provokes. When it was 
pointed out that his recent piece 
on Clinton in the Advocate 
seemed angry, he replied, “I’m not 
an angry person. I never have 
been. On the other hand, when 
you’re subjected to a huge amount 
of rage over a long period of time, 
it’s hurtful — it’s extremely 
wounding — and every now and 
again you do want to hit back.” 

He found the anger his work 
excites puzzling since it often 
comes from people who have ei¬ 
ther not read him or who, in his 
view, willfully misunderstand him. 
“For example, this Sex Panic stuff. 
Suddenly, I’m a neo-Puritan, hav¬ 
ing never written a single sentence 
that could put me in that camp.” 

Sullivan couldn’t keep this 
show of innocence forever. When 
the interviewer pointed out that 
sorrie of his writing went out of its 


way to provoke, he gave a mis¬ 
chievous grin and acknowledged, 
“I do have an edge, and every now 
and again it emerges.” Soberly he 
added, “But I struggle with it.” 

Odd job 

He admitted he doesn’t mind 
making enemies. “I actually have 
a bizarre comfort zone in being 
the odd person out. And some 
people don’t. I think that’s one 
reason I’ve always had this weird 
hostility to Clinton. Because he’s 
the opposite. I think his only 
comfort zone is when he’s got 
complete unanimity and support, 
and I think that’s a very danger¬ 
ous place to be in, because it 
makes you amorphous, like a 
chameleon.” 

Again the phone rang, and 
someone was now downstairs to 
carry Sullivan to his next appoint¬ 
ment. He continued the interview 
as he washed up and made sure he 
had his keys. By now the conver¬ 
sation had turned to his youth. He 
was born and reared in England 
and did not visit this country 
until he was twenty. He seemed a 
little defensive when told his 
speech sounded English. “I’m an 
immigrant, a classic immigrant,” 
he declared. “It’s not like I have a 
foot left over there. I’m quintes- 
sentially American in the sense 
that I’m remaking myself and 
moving on.” 

Remaking oneself is an under¬ 
statement when one has virtually 
returned from the dead. As Sulli¬ 
van left his room for the world 
outside arfd descended in the ele¬ 
vator, he leaned against a rail and 
confided, “I’m just glad to be 
here.” He seemed slightly dazed as 
he walked out into the sunlight, 
but gave a warm smile to a 
woman who was awaiting him. 
“One day at a time,” he intoned, 
and he passed to his next ap¬ 
pointment. ▼

plum role of Desiree. And just in 
case you think Mackay isn’t doing 
enough, she and her husband, 
arranger-producer Billy PhiladeL

for which they will both write 
music and lyrics. The new show is 
a backstage musical about a

clinging to a career that 
doesn’t exist. In the 
show, Mackay will dis¬ 
play her talent for mim¬

music in the style of, 
among others, Mae

Miya Masaoka 

During the second world war, 
Americans demonstrated their 
racism by interning thousands of 


Japanese-Americans for the crime 
of being Japanese-Americans. Re¬ 
fusing to accept their country’s 
delusion that they were disloyal, 
thousands of Japanese-Americans 
insisted on the right to serve in 
the U.S. Army and to fight for 
their country. Many of them 
fought in the European theatre of 
operations where their all Nisei 
unit, the 442, received more deco¬ 
rations than any unit of 
comparable size during 
World War II. 

Performance artist 
and composer Miya 
Masaoka has more than 
a passing interest in that 
history: her father and 
his three brothers all 
served in the 442; 
28 of her relatives 
were interned 
while her father 
and two of her uncles 
were wounded and one uncle 
killed. In Dark Passages, Masaoka 
uses original music, film, video, 
slides, actors, and survivors to tell 
the story of American racism at its 
ugliest. 

“My mother told me stories of 
life in the camps, stories her 
friends told her about Crystal 
City.” Although none of Masao- 
ka’s relatives were in Crystal City, 
“Crystal City became a metaphor 
for secrets of the past. This was 
where the Buddhist priests were 
interned and also the Japanese Pe¬ 
ruvians.” 

Yes, it’s true. The government 


of the United States went to Peru 
and kidnapped Japanese Peru¬ 
vians to trade to Japan for white 
American prisoners of war. 

“That was against the Geneva 
Convention, but the U.S. did it 
anyway. After the war, Peru would 
not let the Japanese Peruvians re¬ 
turn, but they were also told they 
couldn’t stay in the United States 
because they were considered ille¬ 
gal aliens.” 

The fact that the illegality was 
solely on the side of the govern¬ 
ment was not considered impor¬ 
tant. Libia Yamamoto, one of the 
kidnapped Japanese-Peruvians, 
tells her story in Dark Passages. 
The docu-torio is more than just 
spoken word: 

“There is a lot of visual stuff 
going on in the piece and the 
music is very fine, with much of it 
based on the sounds of temple 
bells and Buddhist chanting. 
There is a Buddhist theme run¬ 
ning through the piece, the idea 
that spirituality is a way to get 
through the passages in people’s 
lives.” 

Dark Passages plays one night 
only, December 9 at 7:30 p.m., at 
the Asian Art Museum, Golden 
Gate Park. Tickets are $ 10, and are 
available at the door. ▼

A romp with Antony & Cleopatra 

Berkeley Rep does right by the Bard 


by Richard Dodds 


ntony and Cleopatra seems 
III to bring out the barbs. 

“Tallulah Bankhead 
barged down the Nile last night as 
Cleopatra and sank,” wrote 
Broadway critic John Mason 
Brown, creating one of the most 
famous put-downs in theater crit¬ 
icism. In London, Edith Evans’ 
variation on the Egyptian queen 
was pictured as “a Lady Bracknell 
cruelly starved of cucumber sand¬ 
wiches,” while Vivien Leigh was 
said to “pick at the part with the 
daintiness of a debutante called 
upon to dismember a stag.” 

Just last month in London, 
Nicholas de Jongh created a bit of 
a stir in the Evening Standard for 
penning the most caustic line 
about the much-maligned new 
production of Antony and Cleopa¬ 
tra at the National Theatre. Helen 
Mirren and Alan Rickman, he 
wrote, “rose to erotic ardour last 
night with little more enthusiasm 
than a pair of glumly non-mating 
pandas at London Zoo.” 

The play and its principal parts 
can obviously be a minefield, but 
at Berkeley Rep, guest director 
Lisa Peterson has navigated the 
danger with imaginative bravado. 
Employing a stripped-down ap¬ 
proach that at first looks worri- 
somely bare, the production de¬ 
velops its own aura that focuses its 
opulence on the emotions and 


personalities of the characters. In¬ 
ventive devices enhance Rachel 
Hauck’s set, the lighting by 
Christopher Akerlind is dramatic, 
and the musical accompaniment 
by Thaddeus Pinkston grows lush, 
but ultimately the production 
succeeds because it treats the play 
as it was originally intended: as an 
entertainment. 

Humor is abundant in this 
staging, most of it derived from 
what Shakespeare wrote, but with 
occasional fillips provided by the 
multi-tasking cast of seven. So too 
are the bombastic passions that 
audiences of nearly 400 years ago 
expected. But we also get under 
the skin of the title characters, 
who are here illuminated as great 
figures humbled by very human 
needs and failings. The contem¬ 
porary resonance is unavoidable. 

Joseph Siravo’s robust perfor¬ 
mance as Antony suggests a 
pompous blowhard who behaves 
like a giddy teen when he is with 
his beloved, while Kandis Chap¬ 
pell emphasizes the insecure, self- 
absorbed side of Cleopatra. These 
are entertaining performances 
that skip much of the pretentions 
associated with Shakespeare, 
though sometimes at the cost of 
the verbal glory. 

Siravo and Chappell briefly 
show up as other characters, but 
the other five members of the cast 
regularly and impressively change 
roles (and bits of costumes in 
Joyce Kim Lee’s unpredictable 


Kandis Chappell and Joseph Siravo in Antony and Cleopatra 


mostly modern-dress approach). 
Jonathan Haugen gets his prime 
showcase as Caesar, Tamu Gray as 
Cleopatra’s servant Charmian, 
Elaine Tse as Antony’s wife Oc- 
tavia, Jack Davidson as Antony’s 
comrade Enobarbus, and Harry 
Waters Jr. as the Roman ruler Lep- 
idus. 

Trimmed down to three hours, 
the production can still feel long- 


winded in the second act. But this 
is an accessible, intriguing varia¬ 
tion on a play that has frequently 
foundered. No barbs are needed 
for this outing with the Bard. ▼ 


Antony and Cleopatra will run 
at Berkeley Rep through Jan. 
8. Tickets are $34.50 and $45.

A Starr is born 


by Victoria A. Brownworth 


h, TV. The turkeys were 
dressed early this year for 
if!* Thanksgiving in the Belt- 
way — making us glad were veg¬ 
etarian. 

The Lewinsky-Tripp tapes de¬ 
buted, and contrary to popular 
belief, despite all the back-stab¬ 
bing, tears and gnashing (or was 
that noshing?) of teeth, Aaron 
Spelling had nothing to do with it. 
The tapes reminded us of Dy¬ 
nasty, except without the glam¬ 
our. Sort of a cable-access version 
with a very young and trashier 
Joan Collins and Linda Evans 
with a glandular problem and a 
really bad colorist. We laughed, we 
cried (well, Monica cried), we 
changed the channel. Perhaps 
CNN’s Wolf Blitzer put it best: 
“There’s a lot of material here for 
Saturday Night Live. “ (He would 
know.) No doubt Molly Shannon 
(whose Monica impression actu¬ 
ally makes us understand what 
Bill saw in her) and John Good¬ 
man (whose Tripp is absolutely 
eerie) can expect to wring some 
more belly laughs (emphasis on 
the belly) from that sick tale. 

Following on the (round) 
heels of the Tripp tapes came 
more sound and fury signifying 
nothing. The (yawn) opening of 
the impeachment hearings was 
like an infomercial for McCarthy- 
ism, but without the glamour. 
(Yes, it is a trend.) The Democrats 

— notably Barney Frank (Mass.), 
John Conyers (Mich.) and Max¬ 
ine Waters (Calif.) — provided 
the only emotional moments. 
Chair Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) looked 

— and sounded — more'"con¬ 


fused than usual. 

In best performance by a cy¬ 
borg, Kenneth Starr proved Han¬ 
nah Arendt’s theories about the 
banality of evil and that he could 
have a future on UPN. Exchanges 
between Starr and Clinton attor¬ 
ney David Kendall may also serve 
to invigorate the flagging ratings 
of government conspiracy shows 
like The X-Files. Anyone who did¬ 
n’t believe in that “vast Right 
Wing conspiracy” first alluded to 
by Hillary Clinton on the Today 
show back in January didn’t watch 
till the credits rolled. The Repub¬ 
licans gave Starr a standing ova¬ 
tion at the end of his testimony 
while Hyde, like a White House 
intern after a first date, gushed: 
“Thank you for a wonderful day.” 
(Hello? Since when are impeach¬ 
ment proceedings a good thing?) 
As Karen on Will & Grace might 
say: Bipartisanship be damned! 
We say: They pre-empted One Life 
to Live for this? 

The most disturbing element 
of the impeachment hearings (no, 
not the lack of glamour)? The tid¬ 
bit dropped by Starr that he had 
found no evidence of high crimes, 
misdemeanors or any other offens¬ 
es attributable to the President re¬ 
lated to Whitewater, Filegate or 
Travelgate went largely unreport¬ 
ed on network news. Perhaps, 
Frank suggested, it was all about 
sex after all. And perhaps the net¬ 
works aren’t all run by a liberal 
queer agenda, as the Christian 
Coalition keeps maintaining. 

After the tapes and the hear¬ 
ings, the pathetic step-child of the 
impeachment debacle got her TV 
moment on CBS’s Inside Edition. 
Paula Jones granted her first in- 
depth (Well, TV tabloid) interview 


Junkies and dolls 


by Gregg Shapiro 


ore then a few things have 
changed in the almost ten 
. years since Cowboy 
Junkies first came to our attention 
via The Trinity Sessions, their 
amazing major-label debut disc. 
The Cowboy Junkies now record 
for Geffen, not RCA. Also, the 
music world (including radio, 
where they made quite an impres¬ 
sion with their re-working of Lou 
Reed’s “Sweet Jane”) has changed 
considerably. 

The Cowboy Junkies sound 
like they’re trying to keep abreast 
of things on their latest release, 
Miles From Home (Geffen). Their 
unique sound, which had the po¬ 
tential to get trampled by louder, 
more aggressive bands that have 
come along since their inception, 
has been bolstered and toughened 
(the rhythmic title track, “New 
Dawn Coming,” “Hollow As A 
Bone”) without sacrificing their 
trademark dreamy sound (“Blue 
Guitar,” “Darkling Days,” “No 
Birds Today,”“Those Final Feet”). 

The Goo Goo Dolls are a good 
example of one of those louder 
bands. Just listen to their latest, 
Dizzy Up The Girl (Reprise) for 
proof. The Goo Goo Dolls make 
rocking melodic pop (the current 
single “Slide,” “Broadway,” “Bullet 
Proof”), as well as the occasional 
ballad (“Iris,” “Black Balloon,” 
“Acoustic #3”) that keeps them in 
the public eye (and ear). It doesn’t 
hurt their appeal that lead singer 
John Rzeznik is cute and that they 
have good taste in guest musicians 
(the also-cute Tommy Keene). 



John Rzeznik of the Goo Goo Dolls 


Cracker came into being after 
Camper Van Beethoven ceased to 
exist. Like Cowboy Junkies and 
Goo Goo Dolls, Cracker has also 
experienced some commercial 
success. Gentleman’s Blues (Vir¬ 
gin) should continue that trend. 
Also, like Cowboy Junkies’ lead 
singer Margo Timmins and Goo 
Goo Dolls’ John Rzeznik (who 
does a majority of the band’s lead 
vocals), Cracker’s David Lowery 
has a distinctive, easily recogniz¬ 
able voice, which instantly allows 
the listener to identify a song as 
one of theirs. The sixteen tracks 
on Gentleman’s Blues are no ex¬ 
ception. What is exceptional 
about the songs is their maturity. 
After being a band for most of the 
’90s, Cracker has released their 
most well-rounded album. Songs 
such as “Seven Days,” “Lullabye,” 
“The Good Life,” “Trials & Tribu¬ 
lations,” and “Hallelujah” best il¬ 
lustrate what I’m talking about. 
Also, the hidden track (24) is 
worth finding. T 


with Deborah Norville (who used 
to do serious news, Once upon a 
time). But Norville’s hard-hitting 
(sic) questions sent Jones sobbing 
from the room. Next stop: The 
Roseanne Show. Title this episode 
Trailerpark Trollops’ Triumph. 

This entire (melo)drama is 
scheduled to wrap by Christmas, 
with few surprises. Stay tuned. 
Though QVC might be more in¬ 
teresting. 

Rodman’s 
nuptials, etc. 

For those seeking 
glamour on the small 
screen, or what pass¬ 
es for it these days, 
nearly every TV 
tabloid is 
parading tid¬ 
bits on the Las 
Vegas nuptials 

of gender-bender NBA (remem¬ 
ber the NBA?) star Dennis Rod- 
man and model-cum-TV person¬ 
ality Tara “Call-me-Carmen-Elec- 
tra” Patrick. No info on the wed¬ 
ding dress, hair-style or make-up. 
Oh — and there wasn’t any info 
on what Electra wore either. 

Just in case you’ve been on Mir 
or were abducted by aliens and 
haven’t gotten enough of Ellen 
and Anne, NBC’s Access Holly¬ 
wood did an in-depth (well, 
tabloid) interview with the couple 
on their 18-month anniversary 
(what’s the gift for this, video¬ 
tape?). Sexy Latina host Giselle 
Fernandez (who used to do seri¬ 
ous news, once upon a time, in¬ 
cluding interviewing Castro) 
elicited tales of distress from the 



tow-headed twosome (“People 
hate us,” wept Ellen, “But God, 
Anne and her love have got me 
through this.”) As for whether 
Anne’s career has been impacted 
by coming out, Ellen noted that 
audiences still believed Anne was 
a credible straight girl: “She’s not 
just getting roles as a UPS girl.” 
Unlike Ellen, whose bidet-bound 
career may have her delivering 
packages in 90210 before long. 
Of course there may 
be an opening for a 
celebrity spokesdyke 
at GLAAD, though we 
think her haircut is a 
little too good for that 
job. 

Tears from 
Ellen and 
sharp retorts 
from Anne 

lead us to be¬ 
lieve that Ellen may wear the 
pants but Anne is definitely on 
top. Is it just us or do Ellen and 
Anne seem like a smarter (pardon 
the oxymoron) dyke version of 
Bob and Rod Jackson-Paris? 

A crushed Finch 

Speaking of blondes, David 
Spade gave a fabu performance on 
NBC’s Just Shoot Me last week (or 
was it this week? This show is on 
so many times a week, it’s like it’s 
already in syndication.). Spade’s 
Finch was crushed out on a Blush 
model (again) who was crushed 
out on Mia (Laura San Giacomo). 
In an effort to demonstrate his 
theory that “all women are just 
two drinks away from a one-on- 
one adventure,” Finch attempts to 


fix the two up. The results were 
hilarious. The episode poked 
satiric and quite adult fun at the 
het male obsession with two 
chicks in bed. Possibly the best 
send-up of this tiresome aspect of 
real life ever seen on small screen 
or big (as if size matters). 

On the serious side, ABC’s 
20/20 tackled viaticals this week. 
Once financial magic for in¬ 
vestors providing quick money 
for people dying to make a 
killing, viatical settlements are 
becoming bad investments (to 
which we say: “thank God”). But 
the downside for the post-cock- 
tail generation is it puts those 
who outlive expectations in an 
uncomfortable situation. One 
PWA interviewed for the story 
noted he was getting unpleasant 
birthday cards from angry in¬ 
vestors as well as phone calls re¬ 
questing his medical status, ask¬ 
ing all but: “Why aren’t you dead 
yet?” 20/20 advises: Make sure 
the viatical company keeps your 
identity absolutely secret. 

Finally, ABC’s NYPD Blue 
locked itself another string of 
Emmys over the last few weeks 
with some of the best writing, act¬ 
ing and directing (by Donna 
Desert Hearts Deitch) ever on a 
show consistently well-written 
and well-acted. The last days of 
Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits) 
have been gut-wrenching (though 
we acknowledge many of our 
friends will miss those nude butt 
shots most). Little Ricky Schroed- 
er takes over for Smits next 
episode. 

Sure. ▼

A scene from Robert Bresson's Four Nights of a Dreamer 


Robert Bresson 

M Arts cover 

based on a Diderot novel, with di¬ 
alogue — always difficult for the 
visually minded Bresson — by 
Jean Cocteau. Here we see the 
seeds of his later style. When 
Helene (the glorious Maria 
Casares) discovers her lover is 
bored with her, she exacts a cruel 
revenge, luring him into a ro¬ 
mance and marriage to a woman 
she later tells him is a prostitute. 
Cocteau’s dialogue has its own 
poetry — Helene’s lover says he’s 
glad he’s “spared the ghastly con¬ 
valescence of a waning love” — 
but the film is clearly Bresson’s. 
The characters move through the 
melodrama with a kind of icy 
calm that would evolve in subse¬ 
quent films into an even more 
evocatively spare, monotonal 
style. 

The director’s preoccupation 
— some would say obsession — 
with spirituality and transcen¬ 
dence is evident in his next film, 
the justly revered Diary of a Coun¬ 
try Priest (1951). From the begin¬ 
ning, Bresson tried to delineate an 
interior world in part by mixing 
dialogue with voiceovers. Here he 
uses the device of the diary kept 
by the tragic title character, a 
naive young vicar whose attempts 
to bring salvation to an insular, vi¬ 
cious French village trigger his de¬ 
struction and, perhaps, salvation, 
if we judge from his final words: 
“All is grace.” Here Bresson’s abil¬ 
ity to conjure profound emotions 
out of amateur actors and an el¬ 
liptical narrative reaches an early 
peak; especially noteworthy is a 
wrenching sequence where the 
vicar tries to save a bitter, aging 
countess. 

Homoerotic tension 

Bresson’s most famous, and to 
some his best, film is A Man Es¬ 
caped (1956). Like its hero, 
Fontaine (Francois Leterrier), 
Bresson spent time as a prisoner 
of war, and this may account for 
some of the film’s intensity. The 
director’s sometimes maddening 
methods — omitting important 
plot points, disorienting the view¬ 
er with shots of body parts — 
have brought charges of a lack of 
suspense, and a look at the script 
alone might support this. But 
Bresson gets enormous tension 
out of the excruciating details of 
confinement and attempted es¬ 
cape. The mounting effect of 
these details.— Fontaine’s me¬ 
thodical unraveling and rework¬ 


ing of clothing into ropes and 
mattress springs into hooks, the 
pitiless marches through the 
prison yard — creates a virtual 
dream state and a sense of anxiety 
in the viewer because, in spite of 
the detail, it’s not clear Fontaine 
will escape. Less noticed by critics 
is the sweet, almost homoerotic 
bonding between Fontaine and 
his 16-year-old cellmate and re¬ 
deemer, Jost. 

With A Man Escaped Bresson 
perfected his use of untrained 
players whose line readings are 
seemingly blank, montonal. This 
has the paradoxical effect of gen¬ 
erating an extreme emotional re¬ 
sponse as the audience is forced to 
locate the emotions in the faces of 
the director’s “models,” who are 
“being” rather than “seeming,” in 
Bresson’s words. The narrative 
corollary to this is the effort the 
viewer must put into fleshing out 
events and plot developments that 
the increasingly single-minded 
Bresson refuses to elucidate. 

Based on Dostoevsky, Pick¬ 
pocket (1959), like several of the 
films, opens with a shot of hands; 
and again like some of the others, 
there’s a voiceover mingled with 
dialogue to flesh out a hidden 
world. This world belongs to 
Michel, an alienated young man 
compelled to steal,- events that 
Bresson’s camera describes in lov¬ 
ing detail. One of the film’s most 
evocative sequences occurs when 
Michel meets a more sophisticat¬ 
ed thief who shows him some new 
tricks. Their bond, again, has ho¬ 
moerotic resonances; with the 
scene’s rapid cuts, close-ups of 
hands moving in and out of each 
other’s jackets, there’s a palpable 
sense of pleasure exchanged. The 
ending of this film — which Paul 
Schrader copied verbatim for 
American Gigolo — shows the 
kind of emotional payoff Bresson 
conjures from his supposedly 
emotionless players. The rough 
kisses between Michel and his 
steadfast neighbor Jane separated 
by prison bars is all the more 
powerful for its rarity as a point at 
which two desolate souls merge. 

Unsettling themes 

Bresson’s films were often con¬ 
troversial, and none more so than 
Mouchette (1966), banned in 
some quarters as an incitement to 
teenage suicide. The title charac¬ 
ter is a 14-year-old girl living in 
the same kind of spiritual con¬ 
finement as many a Bresson hero. 
The director typically avoids 
showing overt violence; 
Mouchette’s rape by a local 


drunkard is the more harrowing 
because we only see the events 
leading up to it and the aftermath. 
The director’s provocative idea of 
transcendence is unsettlingly evi¬ 
dent in the film’s extraordinary 
ending. 

Une Femme Douce (A Gentle 
Woman, 1969) was Bresson’s first 
film in color, and also one of the 
few starring a “model” who would 
go on to become an “actor” — 
Dominique Sanda. His skill in cre¬ 
ating a sense of an inner world 
very different from the outer one 
is brilliantly evident in this story 
of an increasingly impossible rela¬ 
tionship between a pawnbroker 
and his wife. Typically, Bresson 
drains the drama from the start; 
the film begins at the end, with the 
wife’s suicide. But in reconstruct¬ 
ing their life together through a se¬ 
ries of flashbacks, he explores to 
grim effect the unbridgeable gulf 
between them and, by extension, 
between all of us. 

Lancelot du Lac ( Lancelot , 
1974) was a pet project for Bres¬ 
son, a period drama based on the 
story of King Arthur’s Knights of 
the Round Table and the search 
for the holy grail. The grail, 
though, is the least of the matters 
here. Internecine fights, failed 
tournaments, bloody ambushes 
are interwoven with long philo¬ 
sophical dialogue sequences. Bres¬ 
son’s pessimism pervades the film, 
but his formal sleight-of-hand 
makes scenes like the joust come 
to life through a seemingly im¬ 
possible strategy — shooting 
most of it at the level of the hors¬ 
es’ legs. The director’s penchant 
for beautiful male faces is also 
manifest in the saintly Gawain 
(Humbert Balsan). 

Bresson’s last film, L’Argent 
{Money, 1983), based on Tolstoy, 
describes a world of corruption in 
its story of a basically innocent 
young man, Yvon (Christian 
Patey), sucked into a vortex of 
crime. The plot sounds like clas¬ 
sic film noir, but this is a color, 
often brightly lit, almost docu¬ 
mentary examination of the mys¬ 
terious forces — predestination, 
in Bresson’s Jansenist religious 
view — that can at once preempt 
lives and offer them that elusive 
state of grace. 


A retrospective of the films of 
French director Robert Bresson 
runs from Friday, Nov. 27 
through Sunday, Dec. 20 at the 
Pacific Film Archive at the 
U.C. Berkeley Art Museum, 
2625 Durant Ave., Berkeley. 




































26 November 1998 BAY AREA REPORTER 45 



Joan Crawford 

◄ Arts cover 

right for her child was born. 

The next year, Crawford had 
her last hit at MGM, again direct¬ 
ed by Cukor. In 194l’s A Woman’s 
Face, she is the horribly scarred 
leader of a blackmail ring. She is 
not a mother, but her relationship 
with a child provides the dramat¬ 
ic conflict in the story. Although 
her appearance is transformed by 
plastic surgeon Melvyn Douglas, 
Crawford cannot give up her life 
of crime. In love with Conrad 
Veidt, she is used by him to infil¬ 
trate the home of his wealthy fa¬ 
ther and becomes his nephew’s 
governess. Under Veidt’s influ¬ 
ence, she is supposed to murder 
the boy. At the last minute, her 
maternal instincts take over and 
she saves the child’s life, then 
murders Veidt when he tries to kill 
him. Naturally, she is acquitted. 
This was not the last time Joan 
would kill for a child. 

Remarkable mix 

In 1945, now at Warner Bros, 
after nearly two decades at MGM, 
Crawford landed her Oscar-win¬ 
ning comeback role as one of the 
screen’s noblest mothers, Mildred 
Pierce. In it, she loses one daugh¬ 
ter to pneumonia and is blind to 
the faults of the surviving one, 
Veda (Ann Blyth), who sets a new 
standard for selfish bitchiness. 
This remarkable mix of noir mys¬ 
tery and melodrama is even more 
fascinating in light of Christina’s 
allegations against Joan, made, it 
should be noted, after Crawford’s 
death and after learning she had 
been disinherited. 

As Mildred, Joan brings 
self-sacrifice to a new pinnacle, 
but at one point, infuriated with 
Veda’s abuse, she slaps her, a scene 
that Joan reportedly dreaded 
doing. (Blyth has stated that 
Crawford could not have been 
lovelier to her.) By now Crawford 
had adopted a second child, son 
Christopher. Two more daughters 
would soon follow. 

With only one exception, the 
mother-daughter relationship in 
Mildred Pierce would set the tone 
for Crawford’s future forays into 
movie maternity. Two years later, 
in Possessed, she plays a step¬ 
mother bent on winning over her 
charges, who believe she had been 
having an affair with their father 
(Raymond Massey) while their 
invalid mother was still alive. 



Michael Cameron Benbrook in 
Christmas with the Crawfords 


When the selfish cad whom Joan 
really loves (Van Heflin) begins 
seducing • her step-daughter. 
(Geraldine Brooks), the desperate 
Crawford tries to stop him and, 
suffering a mental breakdown, 
shoots him to death, but saves the 
girl from a dreadful fate. Doesn’t 
get much nobler than that. 

Although cast in more mature 
roles, Crawford avoided playing ac¬ 
tual mothers throughout the 1950s. 
Instead, she occasionally played 
mother-substitutes. In 1950’s Har¬ 
riet Craig, she takes a young cousin 
under her wing, but soon reveals 
herself as houseproud, horribly 
controlling, and vicious, one of the 
few times Crawford played a com¬ 
pletely unsympathetic part. The 
contrast with Mildred Pierce is fas¬ 
cinating, especially since Joan is ef¬ 
fective in both roles. 

She donned the cloak of noble 
semi-motherhood again in the re¬ 
markable and prescient The Story 
of Esther Costello (1957). Craw¬ 
ford is a rich naturalized Ameri¬ 
can who returns to the small, 
poor Irish village of her birth. She 
meets a young girl (Heather 
Sears) who suffers from psycho¬ 
somatic blindness, deafness, and 
speechlessness. Joan becomes her 
guardian and arranges for the 
child to get the help she needs. As 
young Esther recovers under 
Crawford’s loving, patient, and 
generous care, she becomes a 
media darling and is soon the 
center of a huge televangelical 
money-raising organization, 
spearheaded by Joan’s estranged, 
unethical husband (Rosanno 
Brazzi). When Joan discovers 
what he did to Esther, she makes 



Joan Crawford in Letty Lynton, 1932 



the ultimate sacrifice to avenge 
her ward, killing him and herself. 

Death and axes 

Following her historic and 
hugely successful teaming with 
arch-rival Bette Davis in 1962’s 
Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, 
Joan took on two more mother 
roles, albeit in cheaply-done films. 
In the first, 1964’s Straight Jacket, 
she plays a convicted ax-murderess 


(I’m not making this up) who is 
paroled after many years in jail. She 
goes to live with her daughter 
(Diane Baker), and soon enough, 
dead bodies turn up, all axed to 
death. Well, despite how it looks, 
poor Joan is not the killer this time. 
One guess as to who’s behind the 
plot to send Momma back to the 
big house or otherwise do her in. 

In 1968, Joan went to England 
for Berserk. As a circus-owner and 


ringmaster, the 64-year-old leg¬ 
end’s still shapely legs drew rave re¬ 
views from Time, but the film was 
correctly dismissed as another 
campy horror flick. Judy Geeson 
played her daughter. The cast in¬ 
cluded television’s hunky Ty 
Hardin as Joan’s much, much 
younger love interest, and Diana 
Dors, Britain’s tacky answer to 
Marilyn Monroe and Crawford’s 
romantic rival. Dead bodies begin 
piling up under the big top and the 
killer is revealed to be none other 
than... Poor Joan, still plagued by 
neurotic and ungrateful children. 

By now, Crawford’s astonish¬ 
ing career, which started in silents 
in 1925, was drawing to an igno¬ 
minious conclusion. In her last 
movie, the abominable (and un¬ 
intentionally hilarious) Trog 
(1970), she is a scientist who dis¬ 
covers the evolutionary Missing 
Link between humans and apes. (I 
wish I were kidding.) Although 
most of her natural screen off¬ 
spring had been unworthy of her, 
Joan’s maternal instincts remain 
undiminished. She is compelled 
to teach Trog how to be more 
human and protect him from ex¬ 
ploiters. (A scene of Joan playing 
ball with her charge, instructing 
him to “Fetch, Trog,” is beyond 
description.) Right to the end, in 
reel life Crawford was concerned 
about those weaker than she. 

(In Bette Davis’ last film, The 
Wicked Stepmother, she played the 
title role. On the fireplace mantle 
in their home, her step-children 
kept a photograph of their late, 
adored natural mother — none 
other than Joan Crawford.) ▼

46 BAY AREA REPORTER 26 November 1998 


Out 


OUT 


Electronic sound artist Pamela Z 


The body 
electronic 


W hen the story of pop music in 
the 1990s is written, the 
decade will be divided rough¬ 
ly in half, the first part dominated by 
electric guitars, the second part by syn¬ 
thesizers. Out went grunge rock; in 
came electronica. 

Just as rock encompasses myriad 
ideas and expressions, so electronica 
spans universes.Indeed, it steadily en¬ 
gulfs rock and everything else, its 
monstrous appetite for sampling and 
distorting insatiable. In the process, 
alien ideas emerge like new species, 
most of them with short life spans,but 
some with potential to survive the in¬ 
evitable mass die-off. 

All music forms at one time were 
experimental, so the oft-employed 
phrase “experimental music” is not as 
progressive as it might sound. It’s the 
same as “roots,” but roots just begin¬ 
ning to sprout. Like a river, electronica 
both flows from the past — Eno being 
the fountainhead — and across that 
famous bridge to the next century. 

Here in the Bay Area, we’re blessed 
(some would say cursed) with a huge 
community of experimental musicians, 
most of them working in one way or 
another with electronic sound samplers 
and synthesizers. Recently I heard some 
of the best at Yerba Buena Center, the 
highlight (for me) being Pamela Z 
guesting with Bang on a Can All-Stars. 

Now you, too, have the chance to 
hear this remarkable walking, talking, 
singing, electronic marvel. Pamela Z 
turns her whole body into an instru¬ 
ment, merely waving her arms around 
the metal MIDI nodules poking from 
her scull cap to create waves of distort¬ 
ed sounds. Any other musician don- 
ning such futuristic bodywear might be 
able to create noise, but only a gifted 
artist can transform technology into 
art. This, Pamela Z does with apparent 
ease, as though she were plugged ecsta¬ 
tically into the cosmos. T 


Pamela Z performs Parts of Speech 
at 8 p.m. on Tuesday, December 1 
at Theater Artaud, 450 Florida 
Street. The work employs voice, 
live electronic sound processing, 
sampled speech fragments, found 
text, and projected still and moving 
images. Pamela Z appears as 
narrator, news commentator, 
storyteller, and cantor in this word 
ritual. The performance is a benefit 
for The LAB, an art/performance 
space in the Mission of considerable 
importance to the queer arts 
community. $25 (includes gala 
champagne reception).

Mister Marcus 


j| | ere we are, headed into the 
penultimate holiday sea- 
il i son of the 20th Century, 
and while our various gay and les¬ 
bian communities have yet to 
achieve the legal and social status 
enjoyed by most straight people, 
we have made many strides 
through activism, giving im¬ 
petus to progressive legisla¬ 
tion for the good of all. 

Now we’re at the 
Thanksgiving holiday, 
which was created by 
early Anglo settlers of 
this vast country, osten¬ 
sibly to celebrate the 
strides they made as 
pioneers in a new, 
land. Over the cen¬ 
turies, Thanksgiving seems some¬ 
how to have lost its meaning, and 
is now a minor part of the com¬ 
mercial ritual when Christmas 
spending sprees start and the 
economy surges. 

So it is important to remind 
ourselves what we have to be 
thankful for. In our community, it 
is safe to surmise that we can be 
thankful for all the volunteers 
who do good things for the sick, 



needy and hopeless; for the ac¬ 
tivists who fight the legal battles 
that inch us slowly forward in our 
quest for equality. We should also 
be thankful for the creative energy 
of artists, writers, photographers, 
actors, musicians, vocalists, film 
makers and dramatists who ex¬ 
press their creativity for all of us 
to enjoy, and whose work often 
makes both subtle and in-your- 
face statements about our right 
to live and play as We want 
without interference. 

The evolution of uni¬ 
versal thinking that 
seems to be “live and let 
live” is slow and ponder¬ 
ous in spite of pragma¬ 
tists of political and 
religious persuasions 

_who have not a clue 

abou£ biblical edicts 
which espouse loving thy neigh¬ 
bor. Unheard of only a few short 
years ago, the formation of 
PFLAG serves as impetus for uni¬ 
versal understanding. 

Yes, there are still those in the 
greater LGBT community who 
are guilty of de facto segregation. 
Prejudices still exist, exerted upon 
members of the leather nation 
even here in this highly touted

Hot music from 
a cold climate 


by Gregg Shapiro 


• ; - ver since we were first intro¬ 
duced to Abba, and then as- 
saulted by Ace Of Base, we’ve 
become aware that Sweden and its 
surrounding environs can be a 
source of great pop music. More 
recently, the tradition has contin¬ 
ued with acts such as Bjork, The 
Cardigans, and Robyn. Komeda, 
Legendary Pink Dots, and Baxter 
also generate some heat on their 
discs What Makes It Go? (Minty 
Fresh), Nemesis Online (Soleil- 
moon Recordings), and Baxter’s 
self-titled major label debut disc 
(Maverick/WB), respectively. 

What Makes It Go? is Komeda’s 
second disc for the cutting-edge 
Minty Fresh label, and it picks up 
right where 1996’s The Genius of 
Komeda left off. Combining a dis¬ 
tinctive retro-Europop sound 
with a nineties detachment, 
Komeda makes music to dance to 
that won’t stress you out. Sure 
they sing about Jung and Wittgen¬ 
stein in “Flabbergast,” but don’t let 


that put you off, just get up and 
dance. Lena Karlsson’s distinctive 
vocals reel you in without letting 
you get too close, particularly on 
“Binario,”“It’s Alright Baby,”“Cu¬ 
rious,” “Happyment,” and my fa¬ 
vorite track, the album’s closer, “A 
Simple Formality.” 

Rising from the ashes, or 
should I say grains, of Salt, the 
band in which lead vocalist and 
guitarist Nina Ramsby was per¬ 
forming, the trio known as Baxter 
is set to make their mark on the 
trip hop world. Their deceptively 
pretty (especially “Possible” and 
“Oh My Love”) album, with 
Ramsby’s controlled vocals in the 
lead, belies a tension that you can 
feel vibrating beneath tracks such 
as “Love Again,” “Fading,” “Politi¬ 
cal,” and “So Much I’ve Heard.” 

From Amsterdam’s more tem¬ 
perate region comes Legendary 
Pink Dots, a band that has been in 
existence for almost twenty years. 
Working with a similar combina¬ 
tion of real and technological in¬ 
strumentation, Legendary Pink 
Dots create a soundscape as unique 


as Komeda’s and Baxter’s. Like the 
soundtrack to a dream, their 
twelve-track disc guides the listen¬ 
er through a variety of sensations. 
Highlights include “As Lon'g as it’s 
Purple and Green,” “Is It Some¬ 
thing I Said?,” “Zoo,” “Cheating the 
Shadow,” and “Abracadabra.” 

If your taste runs toward both 
the more exotic and authentic 
(not that any of the aforemen¬ 
tioned bands aren’t either or 
both), or if it’s colder tempera¬ 
tures you are seeking, may I sug¬ 
gest The New Voice of North (Fin¬ 
landia Records) by Girls of Angeli, 
and Roussa Eanan (Atrium) by 
Ulla Pirttijarvi. Both albums, and 
the women who perform them, 
are making an effort to bring 
“yoik” (or “joik”), a “way of talk¬ 
ing and purifying oneself,” com¬ 
mon among the Sami people of 
Northern Finland, to a broader 
audience. They’ve got my atten¬ 
tion, with their combination of 
chants, harmonies, traditional 
and modern instrumentation, 
and I, for one, sincerely hope that 
they succeed. ▼

“bastion of liberalism” city of San 
Francisco. 

It is disheartening and hard to 
understand why this is prevalent 
when we have seen, over and over, 
examples of the tactics employed 
by other groups to gain civil liber¬ 
ties legislation for disenfranchised 
peoples. Furthermore, it is shame¬ 
ful to note that there are those 
among us who refuse to embrace 
diversity in whatever form it may 
manifest itself. To many, solidarity 
is an alien concept. Voting is not 
enough. Representatives whom 
you voted for must be constantly 
reminded that we want our “piece 
of the action”. A lethargic commu¬ 
nity is a doomed community. 
Turned off by the modus operan- 
di of our political clubs? You can 
do plenty on your own without 
joining groups with faux leaders, 
that emerge for their own political 
aggrandizement, access to plush 
jobs, and political appointments. 

Hopefully, in this day and age 
of instant communication, a dia¬ 
logue of inclusion and diversity 
will be initiated by and with our 
so-called leaders. A stamp costs 
only 32 cents; if you aren’t skilled 
in letter writing, ask someone 
who is to help you express your 
opinion. 

Well, enough pontificating. I 
hope you have a wonderful 
Thanksgiving celebration and be 
thankful that there are so many 
among us who are out there on 
the lines feeding the needy, the 
sick and the homeless. Thanks 
also for the generosity of all who 
made donations to those groups. 
And if you didn’t get an invite for 
some Thanksgiving grub, check 
out the Tenderloin Tessie holiday 
dinner at 1st Unitarian Universal 
Church at 1187 Franklin (<® 
Geary). They’re serving from

Class act at the River 

There were two leather con¬ 
tests over the weekend. Saturday 
night, November 21, they chose 
Mr. Russian River Resort Leather, 
and on Sunday, the GDIs staged a 
Mr. GDI Leather contest at their 
Butch Brunch. This being a holi- 


Victory was sweet for Thomas Smith of Minneapolis after winning the 
Mr. International Rubber title at the Cell Block in Chicago on Saturday, 
Nov. 4. 


day issue, and my having a 9 a.m. 
Sunday deadline, the outcome of 
the GDI contest will have to wait 
until next week. But, oh, what an 
experience it was judging the con¬ 
test in Guerneville! 

I’ve judged leather contests 
from coast to coast at every level: 
bar, neighborhood, city, state, re¬ 
gion, and even in foreign climes. 
Ray Allen and his faithful (and ef¬ 
ficient) staff get a solid 10 for their 
efforts. First off, there were six 
contestants, who raised more than 
$800 dollars selling raffle tickets, 
and every one of them was drop 
dead handsome, hunky, sexy and 
friendly. Judging with Philip 
Turner and Omar Moseley is al¬ 
ways a fun experience. The audi¬ 
ence was enthusiastic and sup¬ 
portive of Matt Geiser, Chris Har- 


rill, Max Kline, Ed Mello, John 
Rochat and Janos Zanyl. No time 
was wasted in the pre-judging, 
speech/question, physique and 
leather wear. It was like being 
under the Yum Yum tree all day! 

It took two and one half hours 
to pick a winner, and that turned 
out to be John Rochat, a 35 year- 
old oncologist from Santa Rosa. 
The runner-up was Janos Zanyl. 
Mr. Rochat will compete with 
Taylor Poff of the Rainbow Cattle 
Co. and Phil Bortolussi of River 
Business on December*12. This 
will be a great contest. Hope you 
are making plans to be there. And 
now, the burning question is: 
Who will represent the Russian 
River for the first time ever at 
I.M.L. in Chicago next May? I 
can’t wait! T
