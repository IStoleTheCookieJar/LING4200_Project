[000:10:56;350] THE FAILURE LEADS SCIENTISTS TO

[000:11:38;625] >> IF THEY LOSE THIS MISSION,
[000:11:39;793] IT'S A DEVASTATING SETBACK.
[000:11:41;328] AT THE VERY LEAST, THEY WOULD
[000:11:42;362] HAVE A HARD TIME EXPLAINING TO

[000:11:56;710] BILLION-DOLLAR SPY SATELLITE

[000:12:01;248] AND FLOODS WENT INTO ORBIT OKAY,

[000:12:13;360] WE HAVE ESTABLISHED SOME VERY
[000:12:15;362] TOUGH GOALS FOR OURSELVES IN THE
[000:12:16;930] SPACE PROGRAM.
[000:12:22;168] ANYBODY COULD MEET THEM.
[000:12:23;870] >> REACHING MARS WAS A TOUGH
[000:12:25;071] GOAL AND A VERY TOUGH
[000:12:26;640] DISAPPOINTMENT FOR NASA.
[000:12:28;007] THIS WAS THE MISSION THAT WOULD
[000:12:29;343] HAVE MEASURED THE RED PLANET AND
[000:12:30;577] TESTED ITS ATMOSPHERE WITH THE

[000:13:12;618] USEFUL, VOYAGE BACKWARD TO
[000:13:14;320] CAMELOT.
[000:13:15;655] THERE WAS THE GLAMOUR OF THE

[000:13:26;365] SOCIALIZED ON THE BRIDGE BEFORE
[000:13:27;500] SETTING OFF.
[000:13:29;368] THERE WAS THE BEAUTY OF THE
[000:13:30;569] MASSACHUSETTS COASTLINE, WHICH
[000:13:31;771] EVOKED MEMORIES OF ANOTHER
[000:13:34;473] OWN BOATS, AND THERE WAS THE

[000:13:37;910] SLICING THROUGH THE WAVES IN
[000:13:39;445] PERFECT WEATHER.

[000:13:43;549] AFTER SIX DAYS OF VINEYARD
[000:13:44;983] VACATION, THE PRESIDENT HAS
[000:13:46;118] FOOLED CLINTON-WATCHERS BY DOING
[000:13:47;520] NO GOVERNMENT BUSINESS, AND NOT
[000:13:51;857] SCHOLARS SAY PRESIDENTS NEED TO
[000:13:53;125] ESCAPE THE TYRANNY OF THEIR
[000:13:55;060] SCHEDULES, EVEN IF THEY DON'T
[000:13:56;829] KNOW IT.
[000:13:58;964] >> HIS YOUTH AND HIS VIGOR AND
[000:14:00;966] THE FACT THAT HE'S NEW AT IT--
[000:14:02;467] I'M SURE THAT HE ENJOYS A LOT OF
[000:14:04;002] THAT PACE AND BEING WHISKED FROM
[000:14:07;172] TAKES A TOLL, TOO.
[000:14:09;541] I REJOICE TO SEE HIM RELAX HERE.

[000:14:33;198] GOT HERE, PARTYING WITH THE
[000:14:34;699] ISLAND'S ELITE ESTABLISHMENT.
[000:14:39;304] CLINTON IS TRYING TO GIVE HIS
[000:14:40;672] BRAIN A REST.
[000:14:41;673] LOOK AT WHERE HE'S BEEN AND
[000:14:43;075] WHERE HE WANTS TO GO.
[000:14:44;709] THERE ARE SO MANY POLITICAL
[000:14:46;311] GOALS HE'S SET FOR HIMSELF THAT
[000:14:48;113] THIS MAY BE THE LAST VACATION HE
[000:14:49;882] TAKES FOR A LONG TIME.

[000:15:32;256] RARE.

[000:16:01;586] NOT A CRIMINAL-- HE'S THE

[000:16:06;023] A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY'S CLAIM THAT

[000:19:57;220] THEIR CROPS. ONE REASON IS
[000:19:58;154] BECAUSE THE LAND IS FERTILE,
[000:20:00;122] THE AREA IS SPARSELY POPULATED

[000:23:03;504] CONCERNED NEIGHBORS... AND GOT
[000:23:04;572] A PLEASANT SURPRISE...A THANK
[000:23:05;539] YOU FROM THE COMMUNITY...
[000:23:07;775] MAYOR HAMMER POINTS OUT THAT
[000:23:09;878] SAN JOSE HAS A DIFFERENT GANG
[000:23:11;279] PROBLEM THAN OTHER CITIES...AND
[000:23:12;080] THEY HAVE ADJUSTED CITY
[000:23:12;847] PROGRAMS ACCORDINGLY.
[000:23:17;151] BUT LOCAL COUNCILMAN GEORGE
[000:23:18;185] SHIRIKAWA, WHO WORKS ON GANG
[000:23:19;286] PROGRAMS, REMINDS EVERYONE THAT
[000:23:21;355] THE GANG PROBLEM IS STILL ON
[000:23:22;122] THE RISE...
[000:23:24;324] ....DO THE MOST GOOD."

[000:25:03;723] THE MARS OBSERVER FIRES ITS
[000:25:05;492] ROCKETS FOR A CLOSE LOOK AT THE
[000:25:06;559] RED PLANET.
[000:25:09;596] BUT SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG.
[000:25:11;430] CALL IT THE BILLION DOLLAR
[000:25:12;164] QUESTION:
[000:25:13;432] WHY WOULD A SPACECRAFT SHUT
[000:25:15;134] DOWN, JUST DAYS FROM THE END OF
[000:25:15;969] AN 11-MONTH TRIP THROUGH THE
[000:25:16;803] SOLAR SYSTEM?
[000:25:19;572] JIM STEWART HAS MORE ON NASA'S
[000:25:20;373] NEWEST HEADACHE.
[000:25:24;410] "TWO...ONE...AND LIFT-OFF!
[000:25:26;579] LIFT-OFF! FOR THE TITAN III
[000:25:27;313] ROCKET
[000:25:28;815] MARS OBSERVER AND AMERICA'S
[000:25:29;883] RETURN TO THE RED PLANET!"
[000:25:32;151] THAT WAS THE GOAL ANYWAY WHEN
[000:25:34;353] THIS BILLION-DOLLAR SPACE PROBE
[000:25:35;488] BLASTED OFF 11 MONTHS AGO: MARS
[000:25:37;590] AND ALL HER MYSTERIES....A
[000:25:38;758] CLOSE-UP LOOK-SEE AT THE PLANET
[000:25:40;927] MOST LIKE EARTH IN OUR SOLAR
[000:25:41;961] SYSTEM. ONLY TODAY, NASA
[000:25:43;162] ADMITTED IT'S LOST TOUCH WITH
[000:25:45;364] THE CRAFT...AND HAD TO ANSWER
[000:25:47;466] THE MOST EMBARRASSING OF
[000:25:48;535] QUESTIONS: (Q): ARE YOU
[000:25:49;702] CONFIDENT THAT THE SPACECRAFT
[000:25:50;469] EXISTS?
[000:25:55;909] SPACECRAFT
[000:25:59;245] EXISTS. THE QUESTION IS
[000:26:03;315] WHETHER IT IS IN THE RIGHT
[000:26:04;917] ORIENTATION, AND WILL THOSE
[000:26:07;319] ENGINES PERFORM THE RIGHT
[000:26:08;020] CHANGE OF SPEED?"
[000:26:09;588] TRANSLATION: THEY THINK IT'S
[000:26:11;524] STILL UP THERE...ONLY IT'S NOT
[000:26:13;459] MESSAGES...MEANING THERE'S NO
[000:26:15;528] WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER THE
[000:26:16;695] PROBE WILL REVERSE THRUST ITS
[000:26:18;997] ENGINES - LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSED
[000:26:19;831] TO TODAY - AND LOOP INTO A LOW
[000:26:20;632] ORBIT AROUND MARS.
[000:26:22;401] IF IT DOESN'T? THEN CHANCES
[000:26:23;402] ARE IT'S LOST IN SPACE.
[000:26:25;671] "IF THEY LOSE THIS MISSION,
[000:26:27;873] IT'S A DEVASTATING SETBACK. AT
[000:26:28;941] THE VERY LEAST THEY WOULD HAVE
[000:26:30;176] A HARD TIME EXPLAINING TO
[000:26:32;111] CONGRESS HOW THEY MONITOR
[000:26:32;811] QUALITY CONTROL AMONG THEIR
[000:26:33;546] SUBCONTRACTORS. AND I THINK IT
[000:26:34;646] WOULD BE VERY HARD TO ASK FOR
[000:26:35;414] MORE MONEY FOR BIG PROJECTS
[000:26:36;382] WHEN SO MANY SPACECRAFT, WHICH
[000:26:38;517] COST SO MUCH MONEY, KEEP HAVING
[000:26:40;953] SO MANY PROBLEMS." IT HAS BEEN
[000:26:42;121] A ROUGH MONTH FOR AMERICA'S
[000:26:44;090] SPACE PROGRAM....FIRST A
[000:26:44;823] BILLION DOLLAR SPY SATELLITE
[000:26:46;292] BLEW UP.... THEN A WEATHER
[000:26:47;960] SATELLITE BUILT TO TRACK STORMS
[000:26:49;962] AND FLOODS WENT INTO ORBIT
[000:26:51;063] OKAY...BUT THIS WEEK DEVELOPED
[000:26:53;065] A FATAL SHORT CIRCUIT. SOME
[000:26:53;966] WONDER IF NASA IS
[000:26:54;533] OVER-REACHING?
[000:26:56;268] "I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE GETTING
[000:26:58;237] BEYOND OUR TECHNOLOGICAL
[000:26:59;371] CAPABILITY. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED
[000:27:01;673] SOME VERY TOUGH GOALS FOR
[000:27:02;541] OURSELVES IN THE SPACE PROGRAM.
[000:27:03;442] IF THEY WERE EASY TO MEET,
[000:27:04;477] ANYBODY COULD MEET THEM."
[000:27:06;545] REACHING MARS WAS A TOUGH
[000:27:10;048] GOAL...AND A VERY TOUGH
[000:27:12;284] DISAPPOINTMENT FOR NASA. THIS
[000:27:14;487] WAS THE MISSION THAT WOULD HAVE
[000:27:15;421] MEASURED THE RED PLANET AND
[000:27:18;557] THE GOAL OF MAPPING THE WAY FOR
[000:27:19;492] MAN HIMSELF TO SOMEDAY VISIT
[000:27:20;259] MARS.
[000:27:25;296] AS IF NASA DOESN'T
[000:27:27;099] HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS ... IT'S
[000:27:28;900] BEING PICKETED BY PROTESTORS
[000:27:29;768] SAYING THE SPACE AGENCY
[000:27:31;970] DISABLED THE SPACECRAFT
[000:27:32;638] INTENTIONALLY.
[000:27:33;371] WHY?
[000:27:35;107] THE PROTESTORS SAY NASA IS
[000:27:36;775] TRYING TO COVER UP SIGNS OF
[000:27:37;609] INTELLIGENT LIFE ON MARS ...
[000:27:39;310] LI A MYSTERIOUS HUMAN FACE
[000:27:40;211] PHOTOGRAPHED BY A VIKING PROBE
[000:27:44;149] ONE NASA OFFICIAL CALLS THAT
[000:27:46;417] THE CRAZIEST THING HE'S EVER
[000:27:47;185] HEARD.
[000:27:50;722] IF THAT ISN'T STRANGE ENOUGH,
[000:27:51;523] CONSIDER THIS:
[000:27:52;124] HORSE THIEVES... YES, HORSE
[000:27:54;559] THIEVES, ARE PROWLING AROUND
[000:27:55;794] THE BAY AREA, AND THEY'RE
[000:27:57;129] MAKING LIFE MISERABLE FOR LOTS
[000:27:59;564] KEN BASTIDA REPORTS.
[000:28:04;870] LOOKING AROUND...IT WOULD BE
[000:28:06;872] HARD TO FIND A QUIETER...SAFER
[000:28:07;673] SPOT...ANYWHERE.
[000:28:08;974] THAT'S WHAT SUE DUNSON
[000:28:10;175] THOUGHT... WHEN SHE PUT HER
[000:28:11;309] HORSE EDDIE IN THIS PASTURE.
[000:28:14;646] "THIS PROPERTY.... OF HORSES."
[000:28:16;882] BUT THREE WEEKS AGO TONIGHT...
[000:28:20;118] STOLEN FROM THIS RURAL
[000:28:21;186] PASTURE...THE THIEVES CUT
[000:28:22;420] THROUGH A BARBED WIRE FENCE AND
[000:28:24;589] BACKED THEIR TRAILER RIGHT IN.
[000:28:27;859] "IT IS REAL HELL... THIS HAS
[000:28:29;061] TURNED OUR LIVES UPSIDE DOWN...
[000:28:31;163] LITERALLY, I MEAN TO HAVE
[000:28:33;364] SOMEBODY BE SO CRUEL...AND
[000:28:34;499] HEARTLESS... TO COME IN AND
[000:28:35;867] TAKE OUR PETS... THESE ARE OUR
[000:28:36;668] PETS."
[000:28:37;768] BUT FOR TODAY'S MODERN DAY
[000:28:38;936] HORSE THIEVES... THEY ARE MONEY
[000:28:39;737] IN THE BANK.
[000:28:42;173] WORTH MORE THAN A DOLLAR A
[000:28:43;408] POUND AS PROCESSED HORSEMEAT ON
[000:28:44;242] THE OPEN MARKET.
[000:28:47;812] A MARKET TOO OFTEN SUPPLIED BY
[000:28:49;980] UNSCRUPULOUS AUCTIONEERS AND
[000:28:50;748] SLAUGHTER HOUSES.
[000:28:53;318] "YOU HAVE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO
[000:28:55;553] ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BUT THIS...
[000:28:56;621] THAT'S THEIR LELIHOOD...
[000:28:58;889] THEY'LL STEAL A HORSE HERE AND
[000:28:59;990] DRIVE FOR A COUPLE OF HUNDRED
[000:29:02;260] MILES AND THEN SELL IT... PICK
[000:29:03;261] ANOTHER ONE UP AND DRIVE
[000:29:04;495] ANOTHER HUNDRED MILES AND THESE
[000:29:06;598] AUCTIONS ARE UP AND DOWN THE
[000:29:08;199] STATE... PROBABLY 3-5 OF THEM A
[000:29:08;999] WEEK."
[000:29:11;102] DET. GREG SWETNAM FIGURES LESS
[000:29:13;404] THAN 5% OF THE HORSES STOLEN IN
[000:29:14;472] NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE EVER
[000:29:16;207] FOUND ALIVE... ...MOST ARE
[000:29:16;941] SLAUGHTERED IN LESS THAN 48
[000:29:17;675] HOURS.
[000:29:18;243] SUE DUNSON AND HER FAMILY HAVE
[000:29:19;544] PUT UP SIGNS AND POSTERS ALL
[000:29:20;311] AROUND THE COUNTY... BUT HAVE
[000:29:21;078] TO BE REALISTIC.
[000:29:22;747] "WHAT TREATMENT HAVE THESE

[000:32:58;661] BLACKS.
[000:33:03;499] EXPERTS SAY THESE STUDIES POINT
[000:33:04;500] TO THE NEED FOR BETTER
[000:33:05;534] COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BLACK
[000:33:06;569] PATIENTS AND THEIR DOCTORS.

[000:35:00;048] HERE WE'RE GUESTS
[000:35:00;048] OF AN EMPEROR.
[000:35:02;550] THE ZIMMERMANS

[000:35:04;552] FROM THE PLANET EARTH.

[000:35:28;008] IT'S VERY EASY.
[000:35:28;008] IT'S AN AUTOMATIC.

[000:35:40;588] I DON'T KNOW.
[000:35:42;089] OH, BOY.
[000:35:43;090] WE DIDN'T
[000:35:43;090] BRING THEM ANYTHING.
[000:35:45;092] SO WHAT?
[000:35:46;093] FINE. WE'LL GO.
[000:35:47;595] IT COULD BE FUN.

[000:36:20;827] CLEARFORK FOR FIVE YEARS.

[000:36:27;734] TO PRACTICE NEARER
[000:36:28;435] HIS AILING PARENTS.
[000:36:33;006] >> TODAY, HE IS HANDING OVER
[000:36:33;874] HIS PATIENTS TO
[000:36:34;542] DR. ROBERT DAJAC,
[000:36:39;479] >> I KNOW.
[000:36:40;180] >> HOW ARE YOU DOING?
[000:36:40;946] >> DR. DAJAC HAS JUST
[000:36:41;714] FINISHED THREE YEARS
[000:36:42;448] OF FAMILY PRACTICE TRAINING
[000:36:43;316] IN THIS COUNTRY.
[000:36:46;619] HE IS COMING TO THIS AREA
[000:36:47;453] OF APPALACHIA BECAUSE
[000:36:48;221] OF AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM
[000:36:50;022] THAT MADE HIM AN OFFER
[000:36:53;726] THE PROGRAM IS SPONSORED
[000:36:54;527] BY THE APPALACHIAN REGIONAL
[000:36:58;565] IT RECRUITS FOREIGN DOCTORS
[000:36:59;432] WHO WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE
[000:37:02;368] COUNTRIES, AND PROMISES THEM
[000:37:03;203] A CHANCE TO STAY IN THIS
[000:37:04;003] COUNTRY IF THEY WOULD AGREE
[000:37:06;606] TO PRACTICE IN UNDERSERVED
[000:37:07;440] RURAL AREAS LIKE THIS ONE
[000:37:08;274] IN SOUTHERN WEST VIRGINIA.
[000:37:11;911] EACH FOREIGN PHYSICIAN MUST
[000:37:12;778] COMMIT TO A MINIMUM OF TWO
[000:37:16;882] >> IN WEST VIRGINIA,
[000:37:17;584] EVEN TWO YEARS IS A BIG
[000:37:18;384] HELP.
[000:37:20;320] 75% OF THE DOCTORS RECRUITED
[000:37:21;187] THIS YEAR BY THE STATE WERE
[000:37:22;054] FOREIGN DOCTORS.
[000:37:26;992] MANY CITIZENS IN THIS STATE
[000:37:27;860] WOULD BE GOING WITHOUT
[000:37:32;832] >> GOOD AFTERNOON,
[000:37:34;734] >> MOST OF THE PATIENTS WHO
[000:37:37;169] TO CLINICS RUN BY FOREIGN
[000:37:37;970] DOCTORS ARE EITHER UNINSURED
[000:37:39;939] OR COVERED BY MEDICARE
[000:37:40;707] OR MEDICAID.
[000:37:44;910] >> FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS,
[000:37:45;745] DR. MICHAEL ARBEL,
[000:37:51;484] HAS PROVIDED THE ONLY
[000:37:52;252] PEDIATRIC CARE WITHIN
[000:37:53;018] A 25-MILE RADIUS
[000:37:55;287] FOR THE PEOPLE OF FORT GAY,
[000:37:56;121] WEST VIRGINIA.
[000:37:56;755] >> ALL RIGHT.
[000:37:57;389] >> ONE OF DR. ARBEL'S
[000:37:58;156] PATIENTS IS 19-MONTH-OLD
[000:38:00;592] >> CAN YOU TURN IT
[000:38:03;395] >> WHOM HE DIAGNOSED
[000:38:04;129] WITH A POTENTIALLY FATAL
[000:38:04;929] KIDNEY CONDITION.
[000:38:06;831] >> IF HE HADN'T OF FOUND IT
[000:38:07;699] OUT, YOU KNOW, IT COULD HAVE
[000:38:11;202] TO ME, HE'S THE BEST DOCTOR
[000:38:12;070] IN THE WORLD.
[000:38:16;141] >> THAT'S A GOOD GIRL.
[000:38:20;579] >> THAT'S GOOD.
[000:38:22;681] >> HIS TWO-YEAR COMMITMENT
[000:38:23;515] IS UP, AND HE WILL LEAVE
[000:38:24;316] THE STATE IN OCTOBER.
[000:38:26;685] ONLY 35% OF THE FOREIGN
[000:38:27;452] DOCTORS STAY BEYOND
[000:38:28;186] TWO YEARS.
[000:38:30;789] THAT CONCERNS CLINIC
[000:38:35;694] >> IF WE ARE GOING TO TAKE
[000:38:36;528] CARE OF OUR PATIENTS WELL,
[000:38:38;963] WE HAVE TO HAVE CONTINUITY
[000:38:39;798] OUT THERE AND PHYSICIAN
[000:38:41;333] TURNOVER JUST DOESN'T
[000:38:43;902] >> IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
[000:38:44;703] DOCTOR, IT'S BETTER TO HAVE
[000:38:45;570] A DOCTOR
[000:38:47;972] AND WORRY ABOUT CONTINUITY
[000:38:50;409] >> WHAT'S THAT?
[000:38:51;075] WHAT'S THAT?
[000:38:52;477] >> AS THEY ADJUST
[000:38:53;178] TO THEIR NEW SURROUNDINGS.
[000:38:55;714] RABBIT.
[000:38:57;449] >> THE QUESTION OF WHETHER
[000:38:58;283] TO STAY PERMANENTLY IS STILL
[000:38:59;150] A LONG WAY OFF FOR
[000:38:59;851] THE DAJACS.
[000:39:02;954] CAN YOU IMAGINE LIVING
[000:39:03;689] THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
[000:39:08;126] IF I LIKE IT, MY WIFE LIKES
[000:39:14;999] >> FOR DR. DAJAC
[000:39:15;633] AND THE OTHER FOREIGN
[000:39:16;400] PHYSICIANS, THE GREATEST
[000:39:19;070] INITIAL CHALLENGE IS TO GAIN
[000:39:19;904] THE ACCEPTANCE OF
[000:39:20;604] THEIR PATIENTS.
[000:39:22;807] >> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
[000:39:23;674] TO ME IS THAT YOU LET
[000:39:24;442] DR. DAJAC TAKE CARE OF YOU.
[000:39:27;312] >> AS A NATIVE
[000:39:27;912] WEST VIRGINIAN, DR. FINK
[000:39:28;746] KNS THAT IN ORDER TO REACH
[000:39:31;449] THE PEOPLE OF APPALACHIA
[000:39:32;283] MEDICALLY, YOU MUST FIRST
[000:39:35;320] >> THEY FIRST WANT TO BECOME
[000:39:36;187] YOUR FRIEND, BE ABLE
[000:39:38;789] AND THEN THEY'LL LET YOU DO
[000:39:39;657] A LITTLE BIT MORE PRACTICE
[000:39:42;827] BUT BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE
[000:39:45;429] THEN THEY'LL GIVE HIM
[000:39:50;301] >> YOU AND DEWEY ARE GOING
[000:39:51;135] TO HAVE TO TEACH HIM ABOUT
[000:39:51;970] COUNTRY LIVING, AND JIMMY'S
[000:39:52;837] GOING TO HAVE TO TEACH HIM
[000:39:53;671] ABOUT CUSSING.
[000:39:56;374] >> IT'S TOO HEAVY FOR YOU.
[000:39:57;909] >> PRACTICES THE KIND
[000:40:02;413] ACCEPT HIM.
[000:40:04;315] >> SO WHY DON'T WE GO INSIDE

[000:40:11;856] >>> WHEN WE COME BACK,

[000:40:18;997] DAUGHTER KATHRYN?
[000:40:20;298] >> I NEVER HAVE.
[000:40:21;532] >> HAVE YOU EVER SEXUALLY
[000:40:23;667] >> NO.
[000:40:25;169] >> IT'S A TYPICAL CASE.
[000:40:26;670] YEARS LATER, THE CHILD SUES THE
[000:40:27;438] PARENT FOR SEXUAL ABUSE.
[000:40:29;307] THERE IS NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE,
[000:40:30;408] NO CORROBORATION, JUST THE
[000:40:31;442] CHILD'S RECOVERED MEMORIES.
[000:40:35;078] >> THE ISSUE IS WHETHER IN FACT
[000:40:35;880] THESE THINGS TOOK PLACE.
[000:40:40;117] KATHRYN'S FATHER ALLEGES,
[000:40:41;051] WHETHER THEY WERE PLANTED BY A
[000:40:41;786] THERAPIST.
[000:40:46;156] THAT'S WHAT THIS MINNESOTA
[000:40:47;458] HOUSEWIFE SAYS HAPPENED AFTER A
[000:40:48;692] THERAPIST TOLD HER, "IF YOU
[000:40:49;727] DON'T REMEMBER GETTING RAPED,
[000:40:50;828] YOU WON'T GET WELL."
[000:40:52;630] WITH THAT, SHE SAYS, FALSE
[000:40:53;631] MEMORIES LITERALLY TUMBLED OUT.
[000:40:56;366] EIGHT OR NINE.
[000:40:58;035] >> EIGHT OR NINE DIFFERENT
[000:40:58;803] PEOPLE SHE GOT YOU TO SAY HAD
[000:40:59;804] ABUSED YOU?
[000:41:01;371] >> YES.
[000:41:02;473] >> AND IN FACT, THEY HAD NOT?
[000:41:03;874] >> THEY HAD NOT, NO.
[000:41:05;576] >> THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO
[000:41:06;310] MELODY GAVIGAN.
[000:41:08;011] >> SHE EVEN TOLD ME I WAS DEAD.
[000:41:09;279] >> YEAH, I SAID, "YOU'RE DEAD
[000:41:12;382] >> SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO
[000:41:13;517] WITH HER FATHER FOR THREE YEARS
[000:41:14;585] AFTER SHE SAYS A THERAPIST
[000:41:15;786] INSISTED SHE'D HE'D RAPED HER.
[000:41:19;657] >> I DIDN'T SAY THAT I REMEMBER,
[000:41:20;958] BUT HE KEPT IT UP.
[000:41:23;494] >> HE KEPT INSISTING?
[000:41:25;696] >> YES.
[000:41:29;099] TO HAVE A MEMORY OF SOMETHING
[000:41:30;400] THAT NEVER HAPPENED.
[000:41:33;871] >> THIS IS REALLY THERAPIST
[000:41:35;606] ABUSE OF PATIENTS.
[000:41:43;080] >> HOW EASY IS IT FOR A
[000:41:45;315] MEMORY?
[000:41:48;385] >> IT IS VERY EASY.
[000:41:51;388] >> AND THAT IS WHAT AN EXPERT
[000:41:52;422] WITNESS TESTIFIED THAT KATHRYN
[000:41:53;357] HALL'S THERAPIST DID.
[000:41:55;758] >> SHE HOLDS FALSE IDEAS ABOUT
[000:41:56;826] MEMORY, AND SEEMS TO BE
[000:41:58;027] COMMUNICATING SOME OF THOSE
[000:42:05;635] >> AND WHEN KATHRYN HALL'S
[000:42:06;736] THERAPIST ADMITTED THAT SHE HAD
[000:42:07;670] BEEN ABUSED...
[000:42:09;572] >> I WAS ABUSED BY MY FATHER,
[000:42:11;240] GRANDFATHER, UNCLE, AND BY MY
[000:42:12;909] BROTHER.
[000:42:18;180] WHETHER SHE HAD HER OWN BIAS AND
[000:42:19;448] FOUND, IN HER PATIENTS, WHAT SHE
[000:42:21;017] SET OUT TO FIND.
[000:42:23;452] >> IT IS NOT MY JOB TO DISCOVER
[000:42:24;320] THE TRUTH.
[000:42:26;122] IT IS MY JOB TO FACILITATE HER
[000:42:27;256] AND GIVE HER A FREE, SAFE PLACE
[000:42:35;231] >> WE ALL HAVE REPRESSED
[000:42:36;666] MEMORIES.
[000:42:38;701] >> PSYCHOLOGIST RENEE
[000:42:40;003] FREDERICKSON INSISTS THAT
[000:42:41;203] FINDING THOSE MEMORIES HAS
[000:42:42;304] BROUGHT RELIEF FOR COUNTLESS
[000:42:43;540] PATIENTS.
[000:42:45;174] >> THE CLIENT DECIDES IF IT'S
[000:42:46;108] FACT OR FANTASY.
[000:42:48;011] IT IS THE CLIENT'S JOURNEY, NOT
[000:42:51;848] >> IF THEY RECALL IT, IT DID
[000:42:53;583] OCCUR?
[000:42:55;251] >> IF THEY RECALLED IT, IT
[000:42:56;352] PROBABLY OCCURRED.
[000:42:58;521] >> THE VAST MAJORITY OF
[000:42:59;656] RECOVERED MEMORIES ARE RECOVERED
[000:43:00;924] FROM REAL CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE
[000:43:02;191] THAT TOOK PLACE.
[000:43:06;563] THE DAUGHTER WHO FALSELY ACCUSED
[000:43:07;730] HER FATHER ARE NOW SUING THE
[000:43:08;831] THERAPISTS.
[000:43:11;968] >> YOU JUST KNOW WHAT IS A
[000:43:13;135] MEMORY AND WHAT ISN'T.
[000:43:15;304] >> THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND
[000:43:16;505] SHE IS SINCERE IN BELIEVING
[000:43:17;773] THESE, BUT THEY AREN'T REAL.
[000:43:22;578] DISMISSING KATHRYN'S COMPLAINT,
[000:43:24;146] RULING THAT MEMORY ALONE IS NOT
[000:43:25;548] ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN CHARGES OF
[000:43:27;183] RAPE.
[000:43:29;385] THE RULING CLEARED HER FATHER'S
[000:43:30;886] NAME, BUT BY THEN WHAT HAD
[000:43:32;154] EMERGED IN THERAPY HAD SHATTERED

[000:44:51;033] (IF) YOU HAVE VIOLATED THE LAW
[000:44:52;968] TO GAIN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR
[000:44:54;036] PROFIT, THEN YOU OUGHT TO HAVE
[000:44:56;004] TO FORFEIT THAT PROFIT. DO YOU
[000:44:57;172] FAVOR THE BILL? ABSOLUTELY ...
[000:44:58;206] IT WAS MY IDEA!
[000:45:03;244] GOVERNOR WILSON ANNOUNCED HIS
[000:45:05;814] BACKING
[000:45:11;086] FOR A NUMBER OF VERY DIFFERENT
[000:45:11;920] PROPOSALS ... ALL OF THEM
[000:45:13;555] DESIGNED TO MAKE LIFE TOUGHER
[000:45:14;322] FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
[000:45:16;457] THE BILLS ENDORSED BY THE
[000:45:18;626] GOVERNOR INCLUDE SB 976, TO
[000:45:19;661] DENY DRIVERS' LICENSES TO
[000:45:20;461] ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
[000:45:23;565] PUBLIC OR PRIVATE JOB TRAINING
[000:45:24;365] FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
[000:45:26;534] SB 1131, INCREASING PENALTIES
[000:45:30;739] FOR FRAUDULENTLY OBTAINING
[000:45:32;207] MEDI-CAL HEALTH COVERAGE.
[000:45:35;410] AND SB 691, AUTHORED BY SAN
[000:45:36;444] FRANCISCO'S QUENTIN KOPP ...
[000:45:38;013] ALLOWING POLICE TO REPORT
[000:45:39;314] ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO FEDERAL
[000:45:40;082] INS AGENTS.
[000:45:42;818] THE GOVERNOR SAID IT WAS TIME
[000:45:45;286] FOR CALIFORNIA TO SEND A "CLEAR
[000:45:46;387] MESSAGE" ABOUT IMMIGRATION."
[000:45:48;190] IF NOT CALIFORNIA, AT LEAST
[000:45:48;957] IT'S POLITICIANS.
[000:45:51;526] THE BORDER-- AND THE ISSUE--
[000:45:55;530] SHRINE TO WHICH OFFICE HOLDERS
[000:45:57;732] MAKE PILGRIMAGES... SEEKING
[000:45:58;933] THEIR OWN POLITICAL MIRACLES.
[000:46:00;601] SENATOR FEINSTEIN AT THE BORDER
[000:46:03;170] WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
[000:46:04;504] FEINSTEIN PROPOSES A $1
[000:46:05;973] CROSSING FEE TO FINANCE MORE
[000:46:08;709] AGENTS. SHE SAYS WE MUST GET A
[000:46:09;509] GRIP ON THE BORDER.
[000:46:11;612] SENATOR BOXER TALKS ABOUT THE
[000:46:12;847] BORDER...SHE SAYS IT'S TIME TO
[000:46:15;515] PUT THE NATIONAL GUARD ON
[000:46:16;217] PATROL.
[000:46:18;318] GOVERNOR WILSON, ANSWERING
[000:46:19;720] CRITICS OF HIS PLAN TO CHANGE
[000:46:22;456] THE LAWS AND CUT THE BENEFITS.
[000:46:23;991] SOT(WILSON): "KISS MY REAR END"
[000:46:24;792] AT THIS POINT LET'S AKNOWLEDGE
[000:46:25;592] THERE IS A PROBLEM. ALSO, THAT
[000:46:26;393] IT IS ROOTED IN BOTH
[000:46:27;027] INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS AND
[000:46:29;096] HUMAN SUFFERING. THAT IT WILL
[000:46:30;097] TAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, NE
[000:46:31;031] LAWS, TO BEGIN TO SOLVE.
[000:46:33;200] SO... ALONG WITH THAT...WHAT'S
[000:46:34;001] GOING ON HERE?
[000:46:36;737] POLITICIANS ARE SEIZING ON A
[000:46:37;738] HOT ISSUE...
[000:46:40;540] SOT(YOACHUM): "IN 1982 IT WAS
[000:46:44;378] DEATH PENALTY. IN L992 IT WAS
[000:46:45;512] THE ECONOMY. NOW IT IS AN
[000:46:46;781] EXTENSION OF THE ECONOMY:
[000:46:49;383] ILLEGAL ALIENS. (1, 15:18) SOT
[000:46:50;684] (MAN): "ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TEND
[000:46:53;120] TO TAKE MONEY FROM OUR OWN
[000:46:54;255] CITIZENS. (2, 00:32)
[000:46:56;957] SOT (WOMAN): "WE'RE SPENDING
[000:46:59;493] TOO MUCH MONEY WHEN THERE ARE
[000:47:00;761] OTHER THINGS THAT NEED TO BE
[000:47:01;962] DONE." (2, 06:39)
[000:47:03;264] WELCOME TO THE NEW HOT BUTTON..
[000:47:04;198] WHICH IS AN OLD HOT BUTTON.
[000:47:05;166] WORRYING ABOUT IMMIGRANTS GOES
[000:47:07;101] BACK AT LEAST TOIRISH FLEEING
[000:47:07;902] THE POTATO FAMINE IN 1850.
[000:47:09;804] AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY,
[000:47:12;406] EASTERN EUROPEANS RAISED FEARS
[000:47:13;240] OF TOO MANY THEM IN A NATION OF
[000:47:14;041] US .
[000:47:15;442] HERE WE ARE AGAIN... AND AGAIN,
[000:47:17;044] A QUESTION: ARE PEOPLE LOOKING
[000:47:19;646] FOR REAL ANSWERS, OR ATTITUDE?
[000:47:22;048] SOT(REILLY): "PEOPLE ARE
[000:47:24;384] LOOKING FIRST TO VENT THEIR
[000:47:25;519] FRUSTRATION. PEOPLE ARE LOOKING
[000:47:28;087] FOR PUBLIC FIGURES TO VALIDATE
[000:47:33;059] SO THE PUBLIC FIGURE HAS TO
[000:47:34;628] HAVE ATTITUDE? YES, THE PUBLIC
[000:47:37;631] FIGURE HAS TO BE ANGRY." (3,
[000:47:38;398] 02:10)
[000:47:39;633] WHICH IS THE MOOD IN
[000:47:40;266] SACRAMENTO. CHARGES OF
[000:47:40;934] RACI...
[000:47:41;368] SOT (TBA):
[000:47:42;402] CHARGES OF STUPIDITY:
[000:47:43;337] SOT (TBA):
[000:47:46;206] AND SOME I TOLD YOU SO...
[000:47:47;106] SOT (TBA):
[000:47:51;345] SOT (YOACHUM): "EVERY ELECTED
[000:47:53;246] OFFICIAL WHOS USED ILLEGAL
[000:47:54;881] IMMIGRATION AS A WHIPPING BOY
[000:47:57;484] HAS GONE UP IN THE POLLS." (1,
[000:47:58;284] 08:52)
[000:48:00;053] AND THIS COULD BE THE ISSUE
[000:48:01;187] THAT REVIVES GOVERNOR WILSON,
[000:48:03;923] WHO AT THE MOMENT ISN'T EVEN
[000:48:05;359] THE FIRST CHOICE OF SIXTY
[000:48:06;226] PERCENT OF THE REPUBLICANS:
[000:48:08;261] SOT (REILLY): "THIS COULD BE
[000:48:10;096] THE ISSUE THAT REMINDS
[000:48:11;097] REPUBLICANS WHY THEY VOTED FOR
[000:48:12;131] PETE WILSON IN THE FIRST PLACE,
[000:48:13;266] AND WHY THEY SHOULD NO VOTE FOR
[000:48:14;067] HIM AND NOT KATHLEEN BROWN."
[000:48:15;535] SO, THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS...
[000:48:16;503] IT'S A CROWDED FIELD... MAJOR
[000:48:17;604] DEMOCRATS, THE GOVERNOR. SO
[000:48:20;106] WHILE YOU WATCH... REMEMBER.
[000:48:22;275] IMMIGRATION IS A REAL PROBLEM.
[000:48:24;711] KEEP YOUR EYE ON WHO'S GOT
[000:48:25;445] SENSIBLE PROPOSALS...
[000:48:27;080] AND WHO'S BEING A
[000:48:31;752] FINGERPRINTING IS ONE OF THE
[000:48:32;552] TIME-HONORED METHODS OF
[000:48:33;219] CRIME-SOLVING.
[000:48:34;454] IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE MOST
[000:48:35;188] CUMBERSOME.
[000:48:36;222] NOW, SANTA CLARA COUNTY IS
[000:48:37;624] GETTING SOME HIGH-TECH HELP
[000:48:39;259] FROM A COMPUTER FIRM IN SILICON
[000:48:40;059] VALLEY.
[000:48:41;260] "CONFIRM" IS THE NAME OF THIS
[000:48:43;962] AUTOMATED FINGERPRINT CHECKER,
[000:48:44;764] BUILT BY TRW.
[000:48:46;699] IT USES COMPUTER SCANNING TO
[000:48:49;067] DO THE WORK THAT USED TO TAKE
[000:48:49;835] WEEKS TO DO BY HAND.
[000:48:51;103] TRW IS HOPING THIS PILOT
[000:48:52;438] PROJECT WILL LEAD TO A NATIONAL
[000:48:53;839] NETWORK.
[000:48:55;608] DID HE OR DIDN'T HE? HIS
[000:48:57;209] cLpo%gU
[000:48:59;344] COMMANDER ROBERT STUMPF HAS
[000:49:01;647] BEEN TEMPORARILY REASSIGNED,
[000:49:03;849] WHILE INVESTIGATORS LOOK INTO
[000:49:04;650] HIS LEADERSHIP ROLE AT THE
[000:49:06;084] PILOTS CONVENTION TWO YEARS-AGO
[000:49:08;554] 83 WOMEN SAY THEY WERE
[000:49:09;755] ASSAULTED AT THE TAILHOOK
[000:49:10;456] MEETING.
[000:49:12;525] SO FAR, 175 CASES HAVE BEEN
[000:49:13;893] TURNED OVER TO THE NAVY AND
[000:49:16;562] MARINE CORPS FOR POSSIBLE
[000:49:17;863] PROSECUTION OR PUNISHMENT.
[000:49:27;940] >> OH, YOU THINK-- EXCUSE ME
[000:49:28;641] INTERRUPTING.
[000:49:29;809] YOU THINK IT MAY TAKE AWAY
[000:49:30;876] TREASURY FUNCTIONS OR COAST
[000:49:32;445] GUARD FUNCTIONS OR POSTAL
[000:49:33;278] SERVICE FUNCTIONS, DO YOU?
[000:49:38;317] >> WELL, I THINK THAT IT MAY TRY
[000:49:39;318] TO COORDINATE SOME OF THOSE
[000:49:41;454] AGENCIES AS WELL, BECAUSE I
[000:49:43;422] THINK THE PURPOSE OF THIS WHOLE
[000:49:45;458] SUBJECT MATTER IS TO COORDINATE
[000:49:47;292] LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY, AND
[000:49:48;961] IT'S MY HOPE THAT THE VICE
[000:49:50;996] PRESIDENT'S REPORT WILL DO A
[000:49:53;599] NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH WILL MAKE
[000:49:55;501] IT EASIER TO COORDINATE THE
[000:49:57;703] INTELLIGENCE AND DEAL WITH
[000:50:00;905] INFORMANTS AND HANDLE THE TURF
[000:50:01;639] BATTLES THAT COMES UP ON A
[000:50:02;307] REGULAR BASIS.
[000:50:03;208] I KNOW THAT I'VE SUGGESTED IT A
[000:50:04;576] NUMBER OF TIMES, AND I'VE HEARD
[000:50:05;877] IT IN OTHER PLACES, THAT THERE
[000:50:08;480] SHOULD BE A CHIEF OF STAFF FOR
[000:50:10;115] DRUG LAW ENFORCEMENT, AS THERE
[000:50:11;383] IS WITH THE MILITARY; THAT IS,
[000:50:12;684] SOMEBODY WHO SETS GUIDELINES AND
[000:50:13;751] SOMEBODY WHO CONTROLS THE
[000:50:14;552] INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS.
[000:50:16;921] AND I THINK THAT THE EFFORT ON
[000:50:19;324] THE PART OF THE VICE PRESIDENT,
[000:50:20;725] WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT TO
[000:50:22;194] SEE WHAT THE OUTCOME IS, BUT I
[000:50:23;628] THINK HIS GOAL AND THE IDEA OF
[000:50:24;997] THE NEW ADMINISTRATION WAS TO
[000:50:26;198] COORDINATE LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND
[000:50:27;966] I THINK THAT'S A LAUDABLE GOAL,
[000:50:30;135] AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THEM MAKING
[000:50:33;271] STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION.
[000:50:34;572] >> BUT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THAT
[000:50:35;307] COORDINATION DONE BY THE F.B.I.?
[000:50:36;941] >> WELL, I THINK THAT THE F.B.I.
[000:50:38;276] IS CERTAINLY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT
[000:50:39;911] AGENCY THAT EVERYBODY RECOGNIZES
[000:50:41;613] AND IS THE ONE WITH THE LARGEST
[000:50:43;948] BUDGET, AND IT CERTAINLY IS THE
[000:50:46;584] ONE THAT RIGHT NOW IS BEING
[000:50:48;586] LOOKED TO TO PROVIDE SOME
[000:50:50;255] LEADERSHIP.
[000:50:51;890] I THINK THAT JACK LAWN IS RIGHT,
[000:50:53;691] THAT D.E.A. WAS GIVEN THE TASK
[000:50:55;193] OF HANDLING DRUG LAW
[000:50:57;496] ENFORCEMENT, AND UNFORTUNATELY,
[000:50:59;331] THE CASES HAVE THEN BEEN
[000:51:01;533] PROLIFERATED THROUGHOUT FEDERAL
[000:51:04;002] LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND THAT
[000:51:05;570] CREATED THE PROBLEMS WITH TURF
[000:51:07;439] WARS AND BUDGETS, AND
[000:51:10;675] INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION IS
[000:51:12;210] BEING SPREAD ALL OVER FEDERAL
[000:51:13;545] LAW ENFORCEMENT, WHICH IS WHERE
[000:51:15;447] THE PROBLEM LIES.
[000:51:18;716] >> MR. LAWN, WHY WOULD IT DILUTE
[000:51:19;884] THE D.E. MISSION, THE DRUG
[000:51:23;255] ENFORCEMENT MISSION, AND NOT
[000:51:25;823] CONCENTRATE IT TO HAVE IT PUT
[000:51:26;724] UNDER THE F.B.I.?
[000:51:27;692] >> VERY SIMPLY BECAUSE THE
[000:51:29;126] F.B.I. IS A MULTIMISSION AGENCY.
[000:51:30;962] NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE
[000:51:32;329] RESPONSIBILITY IN CRIMINAL
[000:51:33;698] INVESTIGATION, BUT IN FOREIGN
[000:51:35;132] COUNTERINTELLIGENCE.
[000:51:39;236] AND WHEN ONE LOOKS TO ELICIT
[000:51:40;905] COOPERATION FROM OUR FOREIGN
[000:51:42;273] COUNTERPARTS, THE 50 YEARS'
[000:51:44;375] EXPERIENCE THAT D.E.A. HAS HAD
[000:51:48;012] OVERSEAS CLEARLY IS VERY
[000:51:50;715] IMPORTANT TO THIS EFFORT.
[000:51:52;550] FOR AN AGENCY TO GO IN WITH SOME
[000:51:54;018] 280 VIOLATIONS, VARIOUS
[000:51:56;454] PRIORITIES, THEY CAN ALTER THEIR
[000:51:57;722] PRIORITIES.
[000:51:59;290] THE DRUG SITUATION IS SO BAD
[000:52:00;792] THAT WE MUST HAVE ONE AGENCY
[000:52:02;226] WITH ONE MISSION WITH
[000:52:03;995] INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SPENT A
[000:52:05;997] LIFETIME DEVELOPING THE
[000:52:07;932] EXPERTISE TO DEAL WITH THESE
[000:52:10;068] INVESTIGATIONS.
[000:52:14;806] >> WELL, WHY COULDN'T THEY DO
[000:52:15;539] THAT UNDER THE F.B.I.?
[000:52:16;641] >> BECAUSE THE F.B.I. HAS SOME
[000:52:17;642] 280 VIOLATIONS, AND IF THERE
[000:52:19;010] WERE, FOR EXAMPLE, A TERRORIST
[000:52:20;979] INCIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES,
[000:52:22;513] LIKE THE BOMBING IN NEW YORK,
[000:52:23;948] THE F.B.I. PRIORITIES WILL
[000:52:25;382] IMMEDIATELY CHANGE.
[000:52:29;821] IN DRUG LAW ENFORCEMENT, THERE
[000:52:31;022] IS BUT ONE PRIORITY.
[000:52:33;290] AND CLEARLY IF ANYONE DECIDES
[000:52:35;159] THAT THE SINGLE-MISSION CONCEPT
[000:52:37;629] DOES NOT WORK, THEY ARE
[000:52:39;097] INDICATING A CAPITULATION TO THE
[000:52:42;333] DRUG TRAFFICKERS, BECAUSE
[000:52:44;401] COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
[000:52:47;938] ARE LOOKING TO ADOPT THE SINGLE-
[000:52:49;740] MISSION CONCEPT BECAUSE THEY'VE
[000:52:52;042] SEEN HOW EFFECTIVELY THAT
[000:52:54;011] SINGLE-MISSION CONCEPT HAS
[000:52:55;979] WORKED.
[000:52:57;014] >> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT, MR.
[000:52:58;982] GREGORIE?
[000:53:00;416] >> I THINK HE'S RIGHT.
[000:53:03;920] I THINK THE DRUG PROBLEM IS
[000:53:05;155] REALLY A FOREIGN POLICY PROBLEM,
[000:53:06;322] AND IF YOU LOOK TO THE SINGLE
[000:53:07;791] CONVENTION ON NARCOTICS TREATY
[000:53:09;159] TO WHICH THE UNITED STATES IS A
[000:53:10;193] PARTY, AND THE ONE WHICH WE RELY
[000:53:11;061] ON WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH OTHER
[000:53:12;062] COUNTRIES AND DEALING WITH THE
[000:53:13;329] NARCOTICS PROBLEM, THE SINGLE
[000:53:14;831] CONVENTION REQUIRES ALL THE
[000:53:15;598] SIGNATORIES TO THE TREATY TO
[000:53:16;599] HAVE ONE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR
[000:53:17;634] DEALING WITH DRUG LAW
[000:53:18;401] ENFORCEMENT.
[000:53:20;837] NOW, THIS AGENCY CAN BE A
[000:53:22;706] DIVISION OF A POLICE-- OF
[000:53:24;574] ANOTHER POLICE AGENCY, SO
[000:53:25;542] CERTAINLY YOU COULD HAVE A
[000:53:26;643] DIVISION OF THE F.B.I. WHICH WAS
[000:53:29;179] DEALING WITH DRUG LAW
[000:53:31;114] ENFORCEMENT, BUT IN ORDER TO
[000:53:32;549] COMPLY WITH THAT TREATY, WE
[000:53:33;717] CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE ONE
[000:53:35;351] AGENCY INVOLVED WITH THE DRUG
[000:53:37;554] LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND IF THE
[000:53:39;322] F.B.I. IS GOING TO DO IT,
[000:53:40;223] THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A
[000:53:41;357] SINGLE DIVISION WHICH HANDLES
[000:53:42;559] THAT.
[000:53:45;228] SECONDLY, I THINK THAT TO HAVE
[000:53:46;997] YOUR EXPERTISE IN ONE AREA IS
[000:53:48;398] VERY IMPORTANT.
[000:53:50;834] LONG-TERM INVESTIGATIONS REQUIRE
[000:53:51;868] A HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE
[000:53:53;770] PROBLEM, AND I THINK D.E.A. HAS
[000:53:56;139] CERTAINLY DEVELOPED THAT, AND I
[000:53:57;741] DON'T THINK THAT IF THERE WAS A
[000:53:59;409] MERGER, THERE WOULD BE ANY
[000:54:00;744] ATTEMPT TO CUT OFF THE AGENTS
[000:54:02;112] WHO'VE BEEN WORKING ON THESE
[000:54:03;479] PROBLEMS FOR YEARS; RATHER, I
[000:54:04;948] THINK THEY WOULD ATTEMPT TO
[000:54:06;216] MERGE THEM WITH F.B.I. AGENTS
[000:54:07;851] WHO CERTAINLY HAVE THE ABILITY
[000:54:09;019] TO DELVE INTO SOME OF THESE
[000:54:10;419] DIFFICULT AND COMPLICATED CASES.
[000:54:12;755] >> SOME OF THE-- ONE OBJECTION
[000:54:14;223] CONGRESSMAN RANGEL, WHO OPPOSES
[000:54:15;925] THIS MERGER, RAISES IS THAT THE
[000:54:17;492] F.B.I. HAS A HABIT OF ROTATING
[000:54:19;962] ITS AGENTS AMONG DIFFERENT
[000:54:21;797] DIVISIONS, AND THAT A LOT-- HE
[000:54:23;532] SEES A LOT OF THE DRUG
[000:54:25;034] ENFORCEMENT EXPERTISE BEING
[000:54:26;468] DILUTED WITH THAT.
[000:54:29;605] DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT, JACK
[000:54:32;641] LAWN?
[000:54:34;810] >> YES, I MOST CERTAINLY DO
[000:54:36;045] AGREE WITH THAT.
[000:54:37;312] >> AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, MR.
[000:54:38;280] GREGORIE?
[000:54:40;082] >> WELL, I THINK THAT THE ONE
[000:54:41;751] THING ABOUT A MERGER WILL BE
[000:54:43;953] THAT THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE
[000:54:44;854] A LOT OF CHANGES.
[000:54:47;389] THE F.B.I. PROMOTES ITS AGENTS
[000:54:48;124] BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF
[000:54:48;891] INTELLIGENCE; THE D.E.A.
[000:54:49;658] PROMOTES ITS AGENTS BASED ON HOW
[000:54:50;626] MANY ARRESTS AND THE VALUE OF
[000:54:51;627] THE ARRESTS AND HOW MUCH DOPE,
[000:54:52;728] ESSENTIALLY, THEY PUT ON THE
[000:54:54;696] TABLE.
[000:54:57;499] >> SO YOU MEAN THE F.B.I. WOULD
[000:54:58;267] HAVE TO CHANGE?
[000:54:59;001] >> I'M SORRY?
[000:55:00;202] >> YOU MEAN THE F.B.I. WOULD
[000:55:01;570] HAVE TO CHANGE IF THIS MERGER
[000:55:02;304] TOOK PLACE?
[000:55:03;105] >> WELL, THEN I THINK THEY'RE
[000:55:04;073] GOING TO HAVE TO AGREE-- WHAT
[000:55:05;040] YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE THE
[000:55:06;275] PARTICULARS OF THE MERGER, AND
[000:55:07;943] AGAIN, AS I SAID, WE HAVEN'T
[000:55:08;844] SEEN THE VICE PRESIDENT'S
[000:55:09;745] PROPOSAL, AND UNTIL WE DO, WE
[000:55:11;080] DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THIS
[000:55:12;281] MERGER IS GOING TO TAKEPLACE,
[000:55:13;883] BUT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
[000:55:15;050] SETTLE PROBLEMS SUCH AS THAT,
[000:55:15;785] WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCES AND THE
[000:55:20;522] WAY IN WHICH THEY HANDLE THE
[000:55:22;391] AGENTS, HOW THEY'RE TRAINED,
[000:55:23;959] HOW THEY'RE TRANSFERRED, AND
[000:55:25;560] WHAT THEIR ASSIGNMENTS ARE.
[000:55:29;265] >> ANOTHER OBJECTION I'VE SEEN
[000:55:30;432] RAISED-- JACK LAWN, WHAT DO YOU
[000:55:33;134] THINK OF THIS?-- THAT THE F.B.I.
[000:55:34;669] HAS A NEGATIVE REPUTATION IN
[000:55:36;104] MANY COUNTRIES OVERSEAS.
[000:55:37;605] SOME COUNTRIES CONSIDER IT INTO
[000:55:39;540] ITS ROLE INTO
[000:55:40;775] COUNTERINTELLIGENCE, AND THEY
[000:55:42;010] DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH IT,
[000:55:44;312] WHEREAS THEY DON'T MIND DEALING
[000:55:46;714] WITH THE D.E.A.
[000:55:48;283] IS THAT CORRECT?
[000:55:49;417] >> YES, THAT IS CORRECT.
[000:55:50;618] I HAVE FOUND THAT IN MY TRAVELS
[000:55:51;920] INTERNATIONALLY.
[000:55:53;888] I HAVE FOUND THAT IN SOUTH
[000:55:54;555] AMERICA.
[000:55:55;223] I FOUND IT IN MY TRAVELS IN
[000:55:56;224] EASTERN EUROPE.
[000:55:58;092] IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR A
[000:55:59;727] COUNTRY, IN LOOKING AT THE
[000:56:01;595] F.B.I. AGENT, TO DETERMINE
[000:56:03;597] WHETHER HE IS WEARING A FOREIGN
[000:56:05;766] COUNTERINTELLIGENCE HAT OR A HAT
[000:56:07;235] INVOLVING THE COLLECTION OF
[000:56:09;503] INTELLIGENCE HAVING TO DO WITH
[000:56:14;175] DRUG LAW ENFORCEMENT.
[000:56:15;576] WITH D.E.A., CLEARLY THERE IS
[000:56:16;644] BUT ONE MISSION.
[000:56:19;314] >> MR. GREGORIE, WOULD THAT BE A
[000:56:21;415] NEGATIVE?
[000:56:22;951] >> NO, I THINK THAT WHAT YOU DO
[000:56:24;085] IS THAT YOU WOULD DEVELOP THE
[000:56:25;186] SAME TYPE OF REPUTATION FOR THE
[000:56:27;255] DRUG AGENTS FROM THE F.B.I. WHO
[000:56:28;689] WERE PLACED IN THOSE FOREIGN
[000:56:29;557] MISSIONS.
[000:56:31;492] I THINK ANY LEGATE WHO'S IN A
[000:56:33;228] FOREIGN MISSION WOULD TELL YOU
[000:56:34;595] THE DIFFICULTIES OF DEALING
[000:56:35;763] THERE; THAT IS, THAT YOU HAVE TO
[000:56:36;764] COMPLY WITH THE RULES OF THE
[000:56:37;832] HOST COUNTRY, AND THAT CERTAINLY
[000:56:40;869] YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO
[000:56:42;203] EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH
[000:56:44;572] THEM, AND IT THE WOULD BE MY
[000:56:45;340] HOPE THAT IF ANOTHER AGENCY HAD
[000:56:46;341] THE RESPONSIBILITY, THAT THEY
[000:56:47;408] WOULD DEAL WITH IT.
[000:56:51;512] I THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
[000:56:52;747] HERE IS NOT CUTTING OFF ALL THE
[000:56:54;447] D.E.A. AGENTS AND JUST THROWING
[000:56:55;983] THEM OUT WITH THE BATH WATER
[000:56:57;050] HERE, BUT RATHER BRINGING THEM
[000:56:58;385] INTO ANOTHER SYSTEM AND
[000:57:00;020] HOPEFULLY USING THEIR EXPERTISE
[000:57:01;788] AND ABILITIES TO BRING THE
[000:57:03;156] F.B.I. INTO THE DRUG WAR AT THE
[000:57:04;491] SAME LEVEL THAT D.E.A. IS
[000:57:06;193] ALREADY ACTING AT.
[000:57:09;562] >> UH-HUH.
[000:57:10;898] LET ME CONCLUDE BY ASKING YOU
[000:57:13;200] THIS.
[000:57:15;668] YOU'VE BOTH SAID, JACK LAWN,
[000:57:18;071] YOU'VE BOTH SAID SOMETHING NEEDS
[000:57:20;073] TO CHANGE.
[000:57:21;608] HOW MUCH IS THE PRESENT DRUG
[000:57:23;176] ENFORCEMENT EFFORT BEING,
[000:57:25;045] WHATEVER THE WORD IS, SPOILED OR
[000:57:28;081] MADE INEFFECTIVE BY ALL THE
[000:57:29;917] COMPETITION AND LACK OF
[000:57:31;051] COORDINATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT
[000:57:32;019] AGENCIES?
[000:57:33;153] HOW MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE COULD IT
[000:57:34;687] BE IF THAT WEREN'T SO?
[000:57:36;623] >> I CERTAINLY BELIEVE IT COULD
[000:57:38;225] BE CONSIDERABLY MORE EFFECTIVE.
[000:57:39;359] CURRENTLY, WITH THE $13 BILLION
[000:57:41;194] BUDGET, D.E.A. RECEIVES BUT 8%
[000:57:42;195] OF THAT BUDGET.
[000:57:43;563] CLEARLY THE AGENCY WITH
[000:57:44;464] ACCOUNTABILITY SHOULD BE GIVEN
[000:57:46;199] THE RESOURCES, SHOULD BE GIVEN
[000:57:48;068] THE MONEY IN ORDER TO ADDRESS
[000:57:51;004] AND TO ANSWER TO THAT
[000:57:52;105] ACCOUNTABILITY.
[000:57:53;473] IT'S NOT BEING DONE NOW, AND IF
[000:57:54;707] SOMETHING IS TO BE DONE, AS DICK
[000:57:56;176] GREGORIE HAD SAID, WE NEED
[000:57:57;577] SOMEONE IN CHARGE.
[000:57:58;445] CLEARLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF
[000:58:00;013] THE UNITED STATES CAN BE IN
[000:58:01;481] CHARGE, AND I THINK THE SYSTEM
[000:58:04;084] COULD WORK MOST EFFECTIVELY BY
[000:58:06;886] MOVING THE RESOURCES OF THE
[000:58:08;188] F.B.I. INTO THE SINGLE-MISSION
[000:58:11;658] AGENCY.
[000:58:19;598] >> WELL, YOU DISAGREE THERE, BUT
[000:58:21;968] WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE
[000:58:24;837] WHAT THE SPECIFICS ARE OF THE
[000:58:27;773] VICE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL.
[000:58:29;976] MR. LAWN, MR. GREGORIE, THANK
[000:58:30;776] YOU BOTH FOR JOINING US.
[000:58:32;278] >> THANK YOU.
[000:58:33;179] >> THANK YOU.
[000:58:46;125] >> NEXT TONIGHT, GANG WARFARE
[000:58:47;593] IN CHICAGO.
[000:58:48;827] CRIME, DRUGS, AND GANGS GO HAND
[000:58:50;296] IN HAND, BUT NOW THE GANGS ARE
[000:58:51;697] TRYING TO END THE VIOLENCE IN
[000:58:52;898] ONE CHICAGO COMMUNITY.
[000:58:54;666] ELIZABETH BRACKETT REPORTS.
[000:58:57;136] >> CABRINI GREEN, NOTORIOUS FOR
[000:58:58;437] BEING ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS
[000:58:59;872] HOUSING PROJECTS IN THE COUNTRY.
[000:59:03;942] LAST OCTOBER, THE SHOOTING DEATH
[000:59:05;211] OF SEVEN-YEAR-OLD DANTRELL DAVIS
[000:59:06;745] AS HE WALKED THE 100 YARDS FROM
[000:59:08;580] HIS BUILDING TO HIS SCHOOL, HAND
[000:59:10;016] IN HAND WITH HIS MOTHER,
[000:59:11;417] EPITOMIZED THE VIOLENCE CHICAGO
[000:59:12;851] HOUSING AUTHORITY RESIDENTS
[000:59:15;221] FACED EVERY DAY.
[000:59:17;689] SCHOOLMATES OF DANTRELL DAVIS
[000:59:19;892] LIKE TEN-YEAR-OLD SENQUE SELVEY
[000:59:21;360] WERE TERRIFIED WALKING TO
[000:59:22;461] SCHOOL.
[000:59:23;729] >> IT MADE ME SCARED BECAUSE,
[000:59:24;963] LIKE, I'VE GOT TO WALK DOWN THE
[000:59:26;932] LONG WAY INSTEAD OF WALKING THE
[000:59:28;401] SHORT WAY, BECAUSE YOU NEVER
[000:59:29;668] KNOW, LIKE, IF SOMEBODY IS GOING
[000:59:31;602] TO SHOOT WITH YOU WITH A BULLET,
[000:59:33;371] AND THE BULLET DON'T GOT NO EYE.
[000:59:35;706] >> BUT TODAY THINGS ARE
[000:59:37;575] DIFFERENT AT CABRINI GREEN, VERY
[000:59:40;445] DIFFERENT.
[000:59:44;549] SINCE DANTRELL DAVIS'S DEATH,
[000:59:46;084] THERE HAVE BEEN NO GANG-RELATED
[000:59:47;785] MURDERS IN CABRINI GREEN.
[000:59:50;321] THERE HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN REPORTS
[000:59:51;156] OF GANG-RELATED GUNFIRE.
[000:59:52;157] IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THIS
[000:59:53;991] YEAR, POLICE REPORTS SHOW CRIME
[000:59:55;393] DOWN 24% OVER LAST YEAR.
[001:00:02;400] >> NOW IT IS CLEAR TO EVERYBODY
[001:00:03;768] THAT WHEN WE SAID WE WANTED
[001:00:06;871] UNITY AND PEACE, BROTHERS AND
[001:00:08;839] SISTERS ON THE NORTH SIDE
[001:00:11;842] ARE ONE FAITH.
[001:00:15;213] >> COMMUNITY LEADERS LIKE MARION
[001:00:16;581] STAMPS SAY MUCH OF THE CREDIT
[001:00:17;982] FOR THE DROP IN CRIME SHOULD GO
[001:00:19;117] TO GANG LEADERS WHO NEGOTIATED A
[001:00:22;053] PEACE TREATY LAST OCTOBER.
[001:00:23;154] STAMPS' GROUP, THE TRANQUILITY
[001:00:24;622] MARKSMEN MEMORIAL ORGANIZATION,
[001:00:26;391] THREW A PARTY FOR LEADERS WHO
[001:00:28;326] NINE MONTHS AGO WOULD NEVER HAVE
[001:00:29;894] BEEN FOUND IN THE SAME ROOM.
[001:00:31;796] >> THE FACT THAT WE RESOLVE OUR
[001:00:32;763] DIFFERENCES AT THE TABLE, THE
[001:00:34;432] FACT THAT WE RESOLVE OUR
[001:00:36;033] DIFFERENCES BY TALKING WITH EACH
[001:00:37;469] OTHER, AND NOT RESOLVING THESE
[001:00:39;137] DIFFERENCES WITH A GUN, IS WHY
[001:00:40;905] WE ARE HERE TODAY.
[001:00:45;076] >> AFTER THE SPEECHES CAME
[001:00:46;043] AWARDS.
[001:00:47;112] LONG-TIME RIVALS FOLLOWED EACH
[001:00:49;046] OTHER TO THE STAGE.
[001:00:51;281] >> TO FRED WATKINS, OUR THANKS
[001:00:52;449] FOR THE ROLE YOU PLAYED IN
[001:00:53;884] MAINTAINING THE PEACE IN THE
[001:00:54;852] HOOD.
[001:01:06;330] >> ON BEHALF OF THE TRAVELING
[001:01:07;431] VICELORD NATION, WE'RE GONNA
[001:01:09;266] STICK WITH THE PEACE.
[001:01:11;301] YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING:
[001:01:12;670] NO VIOLENCE.
[001:01:15;072] PEACE, BROTHER.
[001:01:19;209] >> FRED WATKINS GREW UP IN
[001:01:20;778] CABRINI, WENT TO JUNIOR COLLEGE
[001:01:22;479] FOR TWO YEARS ON A BASKETBALL
[001:01:23;881] SCHOLARSHIP, THEN RETURNED.
[001:01:25;983] NOW HE IS AN OUTREACH WORKER FOR
[001:01:27;184] STAMPS' TRANQUILITY MARKSMEN
[001:01:29;020] ORGANIZATION IN CABRINI.
[001:01:30;821] HE IS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE HE IS
[001:01:31;956] ALSO THE LEADER OR CHIEF OF THE
[001:01:33;190] TRAVELING VICELORDS, A CITYWIDE
[001:01:34;759] GANG WITH CABRINI MEMBERS.
[001:01:38;195] AND BEFORE THE PEACE, WHAT DID
[001:01:39;163] IT SOUND LIKE ON A SATURDAY
[001:01:40;330] NIGHT DOWN HERE?
[001:01:42;399] >> WILD, WILD WEST.
[001:01:43;367] FRIDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT--
[001:01:44;501] WILD, WILD WEST.
[001:01:45;502] WELL, SEE, THEY HAVE NO CERTAIN
[001:01:46;737] DAYS HERE BEFORE THE PEACE.
[001:01:49;807] THERE WEREN'T NO CERTAIN DAYS
[001:01:50;541] TO SHOOT-- "SHOOT WHEN YOU'RE
[001:01:51;275] READY."
[001:01:52;143] YOU COULD SHOOT ON SUNDAY WHEN
[001:01:53;310] CHURCH WAS GETTING OUT.
[001:01:56;380] >> WHAT WAS ALL THE SHOOTING
[001:01:57;081] ABOUT?
[001:01:57;982] WHO WAS SHOOTING WHO?
[001:02:00;584] >> OPPOSITIONS SHOOTING
[001:02:01;218] OPPOSITIONS.
[001:02:02;820] THIS ONE SHOOTING AT THIS ONE,
[001:02:04;155] THIS ONE SHOOTING AT THIS ONE.
[001:02:05;322] IT'S ALL ABOUT RESPECT, YOU
[001:02:07;991] KNOW-- "YOU COME ON MY TURF, YOU
[001:02:09;458] GET HURT.
[001:02:13;262] DON'T WALK ON MY TURF WITHOUT
[001:02:14;097] ASKING."
[001:02:16;900] >> HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT
[001:02:17;801] STANDING ON THIS CORNER?
[001:02:21;137] >> NOT REAL GOOD.
[001:02:22;172] >> WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IT?
[001:02:23;539] >> NO.
[001:02:24;007] I LOVE MY LIFE.
[001:02:26;475] >> AND YOU REALLY THINK IF YOU
[001:02:28;444] JUST COME DOWN HERE IN THE
[001:02:30;513] MIDDLE OF A SUNNY AFTERNOON AND
[001:02:33;649] STOOD AROUND, YOU PROBABLY WOULD
[001:02:35;318] HAVE GOTTEN SHOT?
[001:02:36;619] >> YEAH, THAT'S THE TRUTH, YEAH,
[001:02:37;653] SHOT OR SHOT AT, BECAUSE, YOU
[001:02:38;955] KNOW, I WATCH ALL ANGLES.
[001:02:40;890] I'M A TALL ANGLE, 6'5".
[001:02:46;129] >> YOU ALWAYS CARRY A GUN WITH
[001:02:47;197] YOU?
[001:02:47;764] >> I DID.
[001:02:48;932] BACK THEN IT WAS KILL OR BE
[001:02:49;899] KILLED.
[001:02:51;768] DON'T GET ME WRONG.
[001:02:53;203] I LOVE MY LIFE, YOU KNOW, AND I
[001:02:55;071] DON'T LIKE TAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S
[001:02:56;472] LIVES, BUT IF YOU ARE IN A
[001:02:57;506] SITUATION, AND THEY ARE TRYING
[001:02:58;808] TO TAKE YOUR LIFE, WHAT DO YOU
[001:02:59;542] DO?
[001:03:02;245] PROTECT MYSELF, AND PROTECT
[001:03:03;079] MYSELF THE BEST WAY I COULD.
[001:03:06;482] >> DID YOU SHOOT SOMEBODY TO
[001:03:07;183] PROTECT YOURSELF?
[001:03:07;917] >> YES, LIKE I SAID, IT WAS KILL
[001:03:10;720] OR BE KILLED.
[001:03:11;888] >> DO YOU EVER CARRY A GUN
[001:03:12;555] ANYMORE?
[001:03:16;726] >> NO.
[001:03:18;094] I HAVEN'T CARRIED A GUN IN ABOUT
[001:03:19;428] A GOOD YEAR AND A HALF.
[001:03:20;997] AND IT FEELS GOOD.
[001:03:24;433] I MEAN, I WAS CARRYING A GUN
[001:03:26;102] LIKE I WAS THE POLICE OR JOHN
[001:03:28;170] WAYNE OR SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW,
[001:03:29;338] SO-- BUT WE HAD TO BE THAT WAY
[001:03:33;342] AT THE TIME, AND I WASN'T THE
[001:03:35;411] ONLY ONE.
[001:03:37;480] EVERYBODY WAS CARRYING SOMETHING
[001:03:38;814] TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.
[001:03:40;048] >> AND LIKE LAST NIGHT, WHEN
[001:03:41;183] EVERYBODY WAS TOGETHER, WERE
[001:03:42;251] THERE ANY GUNS THERE?
[001:03:43;586] >> NONE WHATSOEVER, NOT A GUN.
[001:03:44;453] NOT A GUN, YOU KNOW, AND IT WAS
[001:03:47;290] NICE THAT YOU SAW VICELORDS,
[001:03:48;591] DISCIPLES AT THE SAME TABLE,
[001:03:50;159] SHAKING HANDS, CONGREGATING,
[001:03:51;927] EATING TOGETHER, YOU KNOW,
[001:03:52;828] REMINISCING ABOUT OLD TIMES,
[001:03:53;796] THIS AND THAT.
[001:03:58;233] IT WAS NICE.
[001:03:59;968] >> NOT EVERYONE IS READY TO
[001:04:00;803] CREDIT THE GANGS WITH BRINGING
[001:04:01;837] PEACE TO CABRINI.
[001:04:03;138] CHICAGO'S MAYOR IS DELIGHTED
[001:04:04;307] WITH THE DROP IN CRIME, BUT SAYS
[001:04:05;641] HE REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANY
[001:04:06;609] CHANGES IN GANG MEMBERS
[001:04:07;843] BEHAVIOR.
[001:04:10;179] >> THEY WANT TO SELL DOPE.
[001:04:11;814] THEIR MONEY IS DOPE.
[001:04:14;249] THESE ARE NOT, YOU KNOW-- THESE
[001:04:15;484] PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING AROUND WITH
[001:04:16;519] THE BIBLE.
[001:04:17;753] THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING AROUND
[001:04:18;521] WITH DOPE, SELLING GUNS, AND
[001:04:19;922] EXTORTION, AND SO WHEN THE HEAT
[001:04:21;123] IS ON, THEY KNOW IT'S ON, AND IT
[001:04:22;525] WILL CONTINUE TO BE ON.
[001:04:23;959] >> DALEY SAYS IT WASN'T THE
[001:04:25;294] GANGS THAT BROUGHT PEACE; RATHER
[001:04:26;462] IT WAS THE $26 MILLION IN NEW
[001:04:28;197] SECURITY MEASURES POURED INTO
[001:04:30;433] CABRINI GREEN BY THE CITY AND
[001:04:32;468] THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
[001:04:36;405] SINCE DANTRELL DAVIS'S DEATH.
[001:04:38;374] EVERY BUILDING HAS BEEN SWEPT
[001:04:40;108] FOR GUNS.
[001:04:41;410] METAL DETECTORS AND SECURITY
[001:04:43;479] GUARDS NOW STAND AT ENTRANCES
[001:04:45;214] THAT WERE ONCE WIDE-OPEN.
[001:04:47;049] CHAIRMAN VINCE LANE:
[001:04:49;017] >> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE IS
[001:04:50;986] A TRUCE.
[001:04:51;686] I AM HAPPY THAT THESE GUYS ARE
[001:04:53;856] WORKING TO GET INDIVIDUALS NOT
[001:04:55;090] TO SHOOT EACH OTHER UP, AND
[001:04:57;492] THAT'S ALL I WILL SAY.
[001:05:00;095] I WON'T RECOGNIZE THE GANGS.
[001:05:01;529] I JUST WON'T.
[001:05:07;669] >> COMMANDER ROBERT GUTHRIE IS
[001:05:09;471] IN CHARGE OF CHICAGO POLICE
[001:05:10;339] OFFICERS ASSIGNED TO HOUSING
[001:05:11;039] PROJECT.
[001:05:12;374] HE'S OUT IN THE PROJECTS EVERY
[001:05:13;308] DAY.
[001:05:15;177] >> THERE'S ONE THING IN
[001:05:16;578] RECOGNIZING AN ORGANIZATION OR A
[001:05:18;446] GROUP; THERE'S ANOTHER IN
[001:05:23;218] OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZING THEM;
[001:05:28;556] IT'S ANOTHER THING, STANDING OUT
[001:05:30;092] HERE ON THE CORNER, SURROUNDED
[001:05:33;295] BY VARIOUS MEMBERS OF GANGS IN
[001:05:34;997] A TINDERBOX SITUATION.
[001:05:37;099] IN THAT SITUATION, IT'S FOOLISH
[001:05:38;767] NOT TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPACT
[001:05:40;168] THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN HAVE
[001:05:41;870] ON THE COMMUNITY.
[001:05:44;106] SO THAT'S A REALISTIC PART OF
[001:05:45;407] DEALING WITH THE COMMUNITY IN
[001:05:47;509] CABRINI.
[001:05:51;213] >> GUTHRIE SUPPORTS INNOVATIVE
[001:05:52;647] POLICE WORK.
[001:05:53;982] HE AUTHORIZED THE ONLY BIKE
[001:05:55;683] PATROL IN CABRINI, AND FOR THESE
[001:05:57;019] THREE, IT WAS THE PERFECT
[001:05:58;486] ASSIGNMENT.
[001:06:00;688] FULL-TIME CHICAGO POLICE
[001:06:02;291] OFFICERS, PART-TIME RAP MUSIC
[001:06:03;025] ARTISTS, THE SLICK BOYS PATROL
[001:06:06;394] CABRINI ON THEIR MOUNTAIN BIKES
[001:06:08;897] BY DAY AND MAKE RAP MUSIC VIDEOS
[001:06:10;799] BY NIGHT-- RAP WITH A DIFFERENT
[001:06:12;700] MESSAGE.
[001:06:15;002] ♪ SOMEONE CAUSED A SHOT,
[001:06:16;070] NOW THE POLICE STOP AND GET HOT.
[001:06:17;772] ♪ AIN'T IT A SHAME?
[001:06:20;809] ♪ YOU'RE CAUGHT UP
[001:06:24;111] IN A GANG GAME.
[001:06:25;747] >> THEIR MUSIC GIVES THEM A WAY
[001:06:26;748] TO COMMUNICATE WITH KIDS USUALLY
[001:06:28;716] WARY OF POLICE.
[001:06:30;284] ALL THREE GREW UP THERE OR NEAR
[001:06:32;420] CHICAGO PROJECTS.
[001:06:34;422] OTHER THAN GUTHRIE, POLICE BRASS
[001:06:36;390] WERE INITIALLY SKEPTICAL, BUT
[001:06:37;425] KEPT QUIET WHEN THEY SAW THE
[001:06:39;427] RESULTS, RESULTS LIKE THE
[001:06:42;029] CONTINUING PEACE IN CABRINI.
[001:06:43;698] >> WE TALK TO ALL THE DIFFERENT
[001:06:45;166] GANGS IN THE COMPLEX AND MAKE
[001:06:47;268] SURE EVERYTHING'S STILL COOL.
[001:06:48;402] WE GIVE THEM OUR SUPPORT; AND
[001:06:49;637] TWO, WE BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS
[001:06:52;139] BETWEEN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
[001:06:53;107] AND THE GANG MEMBERS, BECAUSE
[001:06:55;977] NOW THEY SEE THE POLICE NOT JUST
[001:06:57;879] AS MACHINES, BUT THEY SEE WE'RE
[001:06:59;914] HUMAN, ALSO.
[001:07:02;951] >> NOW THERE ARE FEW KIDS IN
[001:07:05;520] CABRINI THE SLICK BOYS DON'T
[001:07:06;754] KNOW, AND EVEN FEW KIDS FEWER
[001:07:07;889] KIDS WHO DON'T KNOW THE SLICK
[001:07:08;923] BOYS.
[001:07:09;858] ALONG WITH MUSIC, THE THREE USE
[001:07:10;625] SPORTS TO COMMUNICATE.
[001:07:11;593] >> NO SHOOTING.
[001:07:12;694] JUST STAND THERE AND LOOK GOOD.
[001:07:13;461] COME ON, GIRLS.
[001:07:14;095] >> THE KIDS DIDN'T KNOW JUST HOW
[001:07:15;129] UNEVEN THE ODDS WERE.
[001:07:16;097] ERIC DAVIS ONCE PLAYED AGAINST
[001:07:17;064] MICHAEL JORDAN WHEN HE CAPTAINED
[001:07:18;065] THE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON'S 1982
[001:07:19;066] WINNING BASKETBALL TEAM.
[001:07:20;167] HE ALSO HAD A STINT WITH THE
[001:07:21;202] HOUSTON OILERS.
[001:07:22;604] JAMES MARTIN PLAYED HIS SPORTS
[001:07:23;871] AT WEST POINT, RANDY HOLCOMB AT
[001:07:25;106] THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT
[001:07:26;807] CHICAGO.
[001:07:29;443] THEY LIKE THE LIMELIGHT, BUT SAY
[001:07:31;078] IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE GANGS,
[001:07:33;014] THE C.H.A., OR THE POLICE GET
[001:07:34;748] THE CREDIT FOR THE PEACE IN
[001:07:35;983] CABRINI.
[001:07:38;119] >> I THINK SLICK BOYS ARE
[001:07:39;186] CALLING IT THE BEST.
[001:07:41;855] IT IS A PROJECT EVERYBODY GOT
[001:07:43;724] INVOLVED IN BECAUSE EVERYBODY
[001:07:44;625] WAS SICK OF THE KILLINGS AND THE
[001:07:45;926] DRIVE-BYS, AND EVERYBODY WAS
[001:07:48;162] SICK OF IT AND WANTED IT TO STOP
[001:07:50;731] AND WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.
[001:07:52;599] >> THERE'S ALSO SOME SKEPTICISM
[001:07:53;634] ABOUT HOW LONG THIS WILL LAST.
[001:07:55;836] >> WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, FOUR
[001:07:57;371] MONTHS AGO, EVERYONE SAID
[001:07:59;606] "ANOTHER WEEK."
[001:08:01;442] SIX MONTHS LATER, THEY STILL SAY
[001:08:02;976] "MAYBE ANOTHER WEEK."
[001:08:04;845] THE SLICK BOYS KNOW THAT IT'S
[001:08:06;847] GOING TO GO ON AS LONG AS WE'RE
[001:08:08;815] HERE, BECAUSE, LIKE I SAID
[001:08:11;485] BEFORE, WE GO AROUND, WE TALK TO
[001:08:12;953] 'EM, WE'RE RIDING THESE BIKES.
[001:08:15;222] WE TALK TO THE LEADERS ON A
[001:08:16;357] DAILY BASIS.
[001:08:17;991] WE ASK WHAT THE PROBLEMS MIGHT
[001:08:18;792] HAVE BEEN.
[001:08:20;227] WE OFFER SOME SOLUTIONS.
[001:08:21;195] I MEAN, THEY'RE OUT HERE NOW.
[001:08:22;629] THEY LOOK FOR US.
[001:08:24;498] AS LONG AS THE SLICK BOYS ARE
[001:08:25;699] ALIVE AND KICKING, WE ARE GOING
[001:08:26;767] TO HAVE PEACE IN CABRINI.
[001:08:28;902] >> EIGHT MONTHS AFTER DANTRELL
[001:08:29;903] DAVIS' DEATH, THE PEACE WAS
[001:08:31;172] BROKEN.
[001:08:35;576] ON A HOT MIDSUMMER'S NIGHT,
[001:08:37;278] GUNSHOTS RANG OUT.
[001:08:40;381] TWO YOUNG MEN, ONE ONLY 14, THE
[001:08:41;848] OTHER 18 YEARS OLD, WERE GUNNED
[001:08:43;284] DOWN AT 3:30 IN THE MORNING ON
[001:08:44;585] THE STEPS OF THE ENTRANCE TO THE
[001:08:45;786] BUILDING WHERE DANTRELL DAVIS
[001:08:46;720] HAD LIVED.
[001:08:48;722] CABRINI HELD ITS BREATH.
[001:08:51;257] WAS THIS THE END OF THE PEACE?
[001:08:52;492] THE 18-YEAR-OLD WHO DIED WAS A
[001:08:54;427] GANG MEMBER, THE TRIGGERMAN A
[001:08:55;829] MEMBER OF A RIVAL GANG.
[001:08:57;631] THE SLICK BOYS HIT THE STREETS.
[001:08:59;466] THEY WANTED TO KNOW THE FACTS,
[001:09:01;267] AND THEY WANTED THE TRUCE TO
[001:09:03;169] HOLD.
[001:09:05;472] >> IT AIN'T ABOUT A VIOLENCE
[001:09:07;074] THING RIGHT NOW, IT'S ABOUT
[001:09:09;743] TRYING TO KEEP THIS THING
[001:09:11;411] INTACT.
[001:09:12;946] I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO DO
[001:09:14;081] WHATEVER YOU'VE GOT TO DO TO
[001:09:17;150] SHORTIES.
[001:09:18;051] I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IF Y'ALL
[001:09:19;285] DIDN'T WANT PEACE, YOU KNOW WHAT
[001:09:20;353] YOU'VE GOT TO DO.
[001:09:21;722] MY BEEPER RANG 25 TIMES TODAY.
[001:09:22;656] IF Y'ALL DIDN'T WANT PEACE, MY
[001:09:23;657] BEEPER DIDN'T HAVE TO RING AT
[001:09:24;557] ALL.
[001:09:25;826] Y'ALL KNOW HOW TO GET UP IN
[001:09:26;927] THESE BUILDINGS AND COME ON DOWN
[001:09:27;961] INTO THIS FIELD AND TEAR ASS
[001:09:29;930] OFF.
[001:09:31;464] Y'ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN POPPING
[001:09:32;666] OFF ALREADY.
[001:09:34;067] YOU KNOW THAT, AND I KNOW THAT.
[001:09:35;468] SO I THINK SOMEWHERE IN YOUR
[001:09:36;703] HEARTS YOU KNOW THAT THAT AIN'T
[001:09:38;005] THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
[001:09:39;339] Y'ALL DON'T NEED NO PERMISSION
[001:09:40;741] TO START THIS SHIT BACK UP
[001:09:41;642] AGAIN.
[001:09:44;544] Y'ALL MEN.
[001:09:46;579] Y'ALL AIN'T STARTING IT UP
[001:09:48;314] BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT AIN'T THE
[001:09:50;583] RIGHT THING TO DO.
[001:09:52;653] MAN, DON'T START KILLING OUR
[001:09:54;054] COMMUNITY, AND THAT'S ALL IT'S
[001:09:54;921] GONNA DO.
[001:09:57;390] >> ALL DAY, POLICE, COMMUNITY
[001:09:58;324] ORGANIZERS AND GANG LEADERS
[001:09:59;559] WORKED TO HELP KEEP THE LID ON.
[001:10:01;828] THEY LEARNED THAT THE KILLINGS
[001:10:02;929] WERE THE RESULT OF A LOVE
[001:10:04;531] TRIANGLE.
[001:10:05;798] COMMANDER GUTHRIE WANTED THE
[001:10:06;799] COMMUNITY TO KNOW THAT.
[001:10:08;868] >> THERE WAS A GANG CONNOTATION
[001:10:10;270] HERE, BUT EVERYONE HERE
[001:10:12;405] UNDERSTANDS, YOU KNOW, THE
[001:10:13;839] PEOPLE ON THE STREET AS WELL AS
[001:10:15;808] THE POLICE, THAT THIS WAS NOT A
[001:10:16;809] GANG INCIDENT.
[001:10:18;478] IT DIDN'T START A GANG INCIDENT.
[001:10:19;879] THE GANG TRUCE, AS THEY TALK
[001:10:21;614] ABOUT, IS NOT OVER.
[001:10:23;115] THERE IS NO GANG WAR.
[001:10:24;750] THIS IS AN UNRELATED, SEPARATE
[001:10:26;452] INCIDENT, AN INCIDENT THAT COULD
[001:10:27;287] HAPPEN IN ANY SECTION OF OUR
[001:10:28;288] CITY.
[001:10:30;156] >> AT FIRST, FRED WATKINS
[001:10:31;291] WONDERED IF ALL HIS WORK ON THE
[001:10:33;193] TRUCE HAD BEEN LOST.
[001:10:35;361] WHAT WAS THE USUAL REACTION
[001:10:36;529] BEFORE THE TRUCE IF SOMETHING
[001:10:37;797] LIKE THIS HAD HAPPENED?
[001:10:39;932] >> ALL-OUT GANG WAR.
[001:10:41;100] YOU KNOW-- CLOSE YOUR WINDOW,
[001:10:42;968] LOCK YOUR DOORS.
[001:10:45;104] ALL-OUT GANG WAR, YOU KNOW.
[001:10:45;871] BUT, AND FORTUNATELY, PEOPLE GOT
[001:10:46;972] OUT QUICKLY, YOU KNOW, AND LET
[001:10:48;140] IT BE KNOWN-- "NO, IT'S NOT
[001:10:50;577] OVER."
[001:10:53;846] >> ACTIVIST MARION STAMPS WAS
[001:10:54;581] STILL NERVOUS.
[001:10:56;882] >> SEE, SOME PEOPLE DON'T
[001:10:57;917] UNDERSTAND THAT.
[001:10:59;952] EIGHT MONTHS OF PEACE MAY NOT
[001:11:01;221] SEEM LIKE NO LONG TIME FOR THEM,
[001:11:03;089] BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD IT, BUT
[001:11:04;390] EIGHT MONTHS OF PEACE FOR US IS
[001:11:06;359] LIKE EIGHT YEARS, AND EVERY
[001:11:07;660] MONTH WE COUNT IT AS A YEAR, AND
[001:11:10;930] WHEN WE GET TO 12 MONTHS, WE'RE
[001:11:12;699] GOING TO BE STRAIGHT.
[001:11:15;000] >> THE SHOOTER WAS ARRESTED, AND
[001:11:16;502] THE PEACE IS STILL HOLDING AT
[001:11:17;870] CABRINI.
[001:11:19;672] UNLIKE PAST SUMMERS, SENQUE
[001:11:20;873] SALVEY CAN WALK THROUGH CABRINI
[001:11:22;975] WITHOUT LOOKING OVER HIS
[001:11:23;642] SHOULDER.
[001:11:25;477] THIS SUMMER, THE BULLETS HE
[001:11:26;712] HAD SPENT MUCH OF HIS LIFE
[001:11:28;214] DUCKING WERE GONE.
[001:11:28;214] TaN
[001:11:37;957] 20th.
[001:11:41;761] WHAT YOU SEE TODAY IS WHAT YOU
[001:11:42;995] WOULD HAVE SEEN A HUNDRED YEARS
[001:11:44;396] AGO, A COLLECTION OF WEATHER-
[001:11:46;398] BEATEN COTTAGES AND WATER
[001:11:48;200] TOWERS, WITH ONE DIFFERENCE:
[001:11:49;601] AT THE HEIGHT OF THE LOGGING
[001:11:53;239] BOOM, WHICH WAS WHEN MENDOCINO
[001:11:54;473] WAS BORN, IT WAS HUNG WITH
[001:11:55;775] SCAFFOLDING; NOW THE CLIFFS ARE
[001:11:57;442] BARE EXCEPT FOR BLACKBERRY
[001:12:00;579] BUSHES AND TOURISTS, THE TOWN'S
[001:12:04;750] CHIEF SOURCE OF INCOME.
[001:12:07;086] WHEN THE REDWOODS WERE DEPLETED,
[001:12:09;421] MENDOCINO'S FORTUNE BECAME ITS
[001:12:10;956] FACE, WHICH SHINES.
[001:12:13;125] COUNTLESS PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN ONE
[001:12:17;963] LOOK AT HER AND DECIDED TO MOVE
[001:12:19;498] HEAVEN AND EARTH IN ORDER TO
[001:12:21;667] REMAIN, BUT IT IS PRECISELY
[001:12:23;602] BECAUSE OF THE WAY HEAVEN AND
[001:12:25;171] EARTH MEET IN MENDOCINO THAT
[001:12:26;839] UNTIL RECENTLY MOST PEOPLE COULD
[001:12:28;207] NOT SURVIVE.
[001:12:31;076] MENDOCINO IS LONG ON BEAUTY, BUT
[001:12:32;678] SHORT ON WATER, A PRIME
[001:12:35;080] REQUIREMENT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND
[001:12:36;515] JOBS.
[001:12:37;950] THE MOUNTAINS AROUND THE TOWN
[001:12:39;251] ARE NOT EASILY TAMED.
[001:12:40;418] UNTIL RECENTLY, ONLY THE
[001:12:41;853] INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY OR
[001:12:43;288] INDEPENDENTLY POOR COULD AFFORD
[001:12:45;290] TO LIVE IN MENDOCINO.
[001:12:47;692] THEN IN THE 1970'S, A NEW SET OF
[001:12:49;194] SETTLERS CAME TO TOWN.
[001:12:50;929] THEY WERE WELL-EDUCATED,
[001:12:53;031] SELF-DIAGNOSED URBAN MISFITS,
[001:12:56;500] REFUGEES FROM THE COLLAPSED
[001:13:02;173] HIPPY MOVEMENT, THE UPTIGHT
[001:13:04;042] EAST'S CONVENTIONAL WISDOM.
[001:13:07;045] IN THE 1980'S, THEY WERE
[001:13:10;048] DISCOUNTED AS UNREALISTIC
[001:13:12;083] IDEALISTIC DREAMERS; IN THE
[001:13:14;352] CHASTENED 1990'S, THEY WOULD BE
[001:13:15;920] ROLE MODELS OF SURVIVORS.
[001:13:18;556] PEOPLE LIKE PIANIST SUSAN
[001:13:20;524] WATERFORD, INNKEEPER AND
[001:13:25;263] POLITICAL ACTIVIST RIMP BEANA,
[001:13:26;764] BOOKSTORE OWNER TONY MIXAK.
[001:13:30;735] YESTERDAY'S MAVERICKS ARE
[001:13:34;572] TODAY'S TOWN MOTHERS AND
[001:13:36;707] FATHERS, WHO SET THE TONE, WHICH
[001:13:38;642] IS GETTING MORE ATTRACTIVE TO
[001:13:40;444] ANOTHER WAVE OF SETTLERS WHO
[001:13:42;546] WANT TO LEAVE THE CITY FOR
[001:13:44;448] PHILOSOPHICAL REASONS.
[001:13:48;152] THE CITIES ARE NO LONGER SAFE.
[001:13:49;354] NOW FAX MACHINES AND DESIGNER
[001:13:51;555] SOFTWARE MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO
[001:13:52;790] LIVE AND WORK ANYWHERE THERE IS
[001:13:54;392] A WALL SOCKET.
[001:13:57;896] MENDOCINO IS FILLING UP WITH
[001:14:00;264] COMPUTER COTTAGES OCCUPIED BY
[001:14:01;398] PEOPLE LIKE GRAPHIC DESIGNER
[001:14:03;166] SCOTT PETERSON, WHOSE CLIENTS
[001:14:04;734] ARE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND
[001:14:06;569] CONDUCTOR ALAN POLLACK, WHO USES
[001:14:09;072] A COMPUTER SYNTHESIZER FOR HIS
[001:14:10;440] COMPOSING.
[001:14:14;711] THE TELEVISION SERIES "MURDER
[001:14:16;079] SHE WROTE" IS FILMED IN
[001:14:17;480] MENDOCINO, BUT "MUSIC SHE WROTE"
[001:14:18;815] MORE ACCURATELY DESCRIBES THE
[001:14:20;517] TOWN FULL OF ACTORS AND
[001:14:22;319] MUSICIANS.
[001:14:24;621] THE LOCAL BULLETIN BOARDS ARE
[001:14:28;125] JAMMED WITH RECITAL
[001:14:30;928] ANNOUNCEMENTS, GALLERY OPENINGS,
[001:14:33;863] AND PLAYS, AND CONCLUDED OVER
[001:14:36;099] THE LAST TWO WEEKS IN JULY WAS
[001:14:39;136] MENDOCINO'S SEVENTH HIGHLY
[001:14:41;471] SUCCESSFUL ANNUAL MUSIC
[001:14:44;441] FESTIVAL, HELD BENEATH THE TENT,
[001:14:45;842] UNDER THE HEAVENS.
[001:14:49;779] IT WOULD BE WILDLY INACCURATE TO
[001:14:51;648] IMPLY THAT LIVING IN MENDOCINO
[001:14:54;084] IS EASY, BUT WILLIAM JAMES
[001:14:55;752] LABELED THE CONVENIENT "JUST
[001:14:58;956] LIFE."
[001:15:02;359] IT'S ROUTINE IN A TOWN SETTLED
[001:15:03;927] BY LUMBERJACKS.
[001:15:05;628] TODAY THAT LIFE IS SUSTAINED BY
[001:15:06;729] CHRISTIE, A WAITRESS TURNED
[001:15:07;998] EDITOR AND CHIEF OF THE
[001:15:08;631] "MENDOCINO BEACON," THE TOWN'S
[001:15:09;666] NEWSPAPER, WHICH HASN'T STOPPED
[001:15:11;801] PUBLISHING SINCE ITS FOUNDING
[001:15:13;003] 116 YEARS AGO.
[001:15:15;872] ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE OF
[001:15:17;207] PEOPLE LIKE CHRISTIE WHO,
[001:15:18;740] UNBELIEVABLY, WRITES AND

[001:18:13;080] SO BRUTAL, HE CAN'T REMEMBER
[001:18:14;248] MOST OF WHAT HAPPENED.

[001:18:25;592] AT HIS BEATING TRIAL, REGINALD
[001:18:26;994] DENNY SAID HE COULDN'T REMEMBER
[001:18:29;697] THE ATTACK AT THE FLASHPOINT OF
[001:18:32;432] THE LOS ANGELES RIOTS. DURING A
[001:18:33;701] BREAK, HE LEFT THE WITNESS
[001:18:35;136] STAND AND HUGGED THE MOTHERS OF
[001:18:39;206] HIS ACCUSED ASSAILANTS. "MAY I

[001:18:49;249] YOU," SHE SAID. "I'M SO GLAD TO
[001:18:51;385] MEET YOU." DENNY THEN WALKED

[001:19:57;316] 3, 1991. DENNY'S BEATING HAS
[001:19:59;552] BECOME A SYMBOLIC COUNTERPOINT
[001:20:00;653] TO THE KING BEATING. DENNY IS
[001:20:01;621] WHITE, AND HIS ACCUSED
[001:20:03;890] ATTACKERS ARE BLACK. DENNY

[001:20:43;095] WATCHING AT HOME, TOO.
[001:20:44;196] >> I FEEL LIKE I GOT HIT MYSELF.
[001:20:46;965] >> WHY IS THAT?
[001:20:48;534] >> I'M A TRUCK DRIVER AND HE'S
[001:20:49;602] A TRUCK DRIVER, SO IT'S ALMOST
[001:20:50;469] ABOUT THE SAME THING.

[001:20:55;174] ONTO THE TRUCK.

[001:20:58;210] OR FOUR TIMES TO LET ME GET
[001:20:59;679] INSIDE THE TRUCK AT FIRST.
[001:21:02;481] >> AND I'M SAYING TO REGINALD,
[001:21:10;523] GREEN GOT BEHIND THE WHEEL.
[001:21:12;325] >> REGGIE WAS ASKING ME WHY
[001:21:13;459] THESE PEOPLE WAS BEATING HIM UP.
[001:21:14;360] I SAID, "I DON'T KNOW."
[001:21:15;227] AND AFTER THAT HE THANKED ME FOR
[001:21:15;994] SAVING HIS LIFE.

[001:21:32;311] NONE OF THEM COULD IDENTIFY
[001:21:34;413] DENNY'S ATTACKERS.
[001:21:35;781] THE DEFENSE SAYS THAT PARADING
[001:21:37;516] BLACK GOOD SAMARITANS IS A

[001:21:44;323] RACIALLY MOTIVATED.
[001:21:45;958] >> THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT'S
[001:21:47;192] BLACK AND WHITE.
[001:21:48;193] WHEN YOU FACE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM
[001:21:49;127] AND YOU'RE BLACK, YOU HAVE A
[001:21:50;095] REAL HEAVY BURDEN TO OVERCOME.
[001:21:51;063] >> THE GOOD SAMARITANS SAID THAT
[001:21:52;097] RACE IS NOT A FACTOR WHEN THEY
[001:21:52;965] HAD RUSHED TO HELP HIM.
[001:21:53;798] THEY SAY THEY DID WHAT THEY HAD
[001:21:54;699] TO DO.

[001:28:16;211] "RIGHT" SAID LEI YUILLE. SO
[001:28:18;780] SACRAMENTO LANDLADY DORTHEA
[001:28:21;382] OF TURNING TO DUST BEFORE
[001:28:22;217] HIS VERY EYES.
[001:28:27;188] >>> AS ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD
[001:28:28;055] ABUSE ESCALATE AROUND
[001:28:28;822] MICHAEL JACKSON,
[001:28:29;990] IT'S BECOMING OBVIOUS THAT
[001:28:30;824] ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL
[001:28:31;659] ENTERTAINMENT CAREERS EVER
[001:28:33;160] COULD VERY POSSIBLY COME
[001:28:33;961] CRASHING DOWN.
[001:28:35;829] THE QUESTION IS, WHAT SHOU
[001:28:36;697] MICHAEL JACKSON DO RIGHT NOW
[001:28:37;898] TO CONTROL WHATEVER DAMAGE
[001:28:39;333] IS BEING DONE TO
[001:28:40;668] HIS REPUTATION?
[001:28:44;772] IN BANGKOK TODAY,
[001:28:45;473] JACKSON CANCELLED HIS SECOND
[001:28:46;340] STRAIGHT PERFORMANCE,
[001:28:47;107] CLAIMING AN ILLNESS DUE
[001:28:47;908] TO DEHYDRATION.
[001:28:49;543] HE ISSUED AN APOLOGY
[001:28:50;278] ON AUDIO TAPE.
[001:28:54;548] >> I AM SORRY I AM NOT
[001:28:56;216] PERFORMING.
[001:28:57;851] >> THE CANCELLATION ANGERED
[001:28:58;719] SEVERAL FANS WITH TICKETS
[001:28:59;553] TO THE SHOW.
[001:29:02;290] >> HE SHOULD UNDERSTAND.
[001:29:05;025] >> SO FAR, JACKSON HAS
[001:29:05;793] REMAINED SECLUDED
[001:29:06;494] IN HIS BANGKOK HOTEL,
[001:29:07;261] ISSUING STATEMENTS THROUGH
[001:29:08;095] HIS ATTORNEYS IN LOS ANGELES
[001:29:08;962] AND BANGKOK.
[001:29:09;563] BUT IS SECLUSION THE RIGHT
[001:29:10;398] MOVE NOW?
[001:29:11;599] ELISABETH HANDLER IS
[001:29:12;333] A P.R. CONSULTANT
[001:29:13;033] SPECIALIZING IN DAMAGE
[001:29:13;801] CONTROL, AND WHO HELPED
[001:29:15;068] MANAGE PUBLICITY ON THE 1984
[001:29:16;904] PEPSI COMMERCIAL IN WHICH
[001:29:17;738] JACKSON WAS INJURED
[001:29:18;472] DURING PRODUCTION,
[001:29:19;373] AND SHE SAYS MICHAEL SHOULD
[001:29:20;240] SPEAK FOR HIMSELF.
[001:29:23;544] >> THE GUY'S REPUTATION IS
[001:29:24;779] ON THE LINE RIGHT NOW,
[001:29:27;014] AND IF HE DOESN'T STAND UP
[001:29:28;649] AND IF HE ISN'T SEEN TO BE
[001:29:30;451] FIGHTING FOR HIMSELF,
[001:29:31;686] HE'S GOING TO LOSE A LOT
[001:29:32;486] IN THAT AREA.
[001:29:34;087] >> SO FAR, PEPSI,
[001:29:34;789] THE COMPANY SPONSORING
[001:29:35;556] JACKSON'S WORLD TOUR,
[001:29:36;857] IS STANDING BEHIND HIM.
[001:29:38;459] THIS AD FEATURING MICHAEL
[001:29:39;293] CONTINUES TO RUN IN ASIA.
[001:29:44;598] BUT WHAT OF OTHER
[001:29:45;299] ENDORSEMENT DEALS?
[001:29:46;433] FRED DANZIG OF "ADVERTISING
[001:29:47;300] AGE" MAGAZINE SAYS JACKSON
[001:29:48;134] SHOULD HAVE ONE IMMEDIATE
[001:29:50;002] PRIORITY.
[001:29:51;471] >> HIS BEST BET IS TO WALK
[001:29:52;605] AWAY FROM THIS PROVING THAT
[001:29:53;473] HE'S INNOCENT.
[001:29:56;242] >> OF COURSE, AT BIGGEST
[001:29:57;043] RISK IS JACKSON'S ENTIRE
[001:29:57;844] MUSIC CAREER.
[001:30:00;213] THE POP STAR EARNED OVER
[001:30:01;013] $26 MILLION LAST YEAR.
[001:30:02;281] "NEW YORK NEWSDAY" POP MUSIC
[001:30:03;149] CRITIC WAYNE ROBINS SAYS
[001:30:04;484] THAT IF, IN FACT, MICHAEL IS
[001:30:05;585] INNOCENT, THEN HE MAY COME
[001:30:07;053] OUT ALL RIGHT.
[001:30:08;722] >> IF IT'S UNTRUE,
[001:30:11;324] THERE WILL BE A BACKLASH
[001:30:12;459] OF SUPPORT AND KINDNESS
[001:30:15;762] BECAUSE MICHAEL JACKSON IS
[001:30:16;596] A BELOVED FIGURE ALL ACROSS
[001:30:18;197] THE PLANET.
[001:30:22;802] >>> THE "HEAL THE WORLD

[001:30:24;437] TO PUT OUT ITS ANNUAL

[001:30:26;038] WEEKEND, BUT IT HAS BEEN PUT
[001:30:26;906] ON HOLD.
[001:30:31;944] THE FOUNDATION DENIES THE
[001:30:34;514] EXISTENCE OF ANY SUCH
[001:30:36;315] CALENDAR.
[001:30:36;883] IN THE MEANTIME, THE OTHER

[001:30:50;897] LEADING TO TALK AROUND
[001:30:51;664] THE SET OF HIS TV SERIES
[001:30:52;465] THAT BURT IS ABOUT
[001:30:53;165] TO UNDERGO SOME FORM

[001:30:54;768] "EVENING SHADE" IS ABOUT
[001:30:55;568] TO GO ON A SHORT VACATION.
[001:30:56;403] A PERSONAL ASSISTANT
[001:30:57;136] FOR REYNOLDS, HOWEVER,
[001:30:57;904] TELLS "ENTERTAINMENT
[001:30:58;638] TONIGHT" THE STORY IS
[001:30:59;406] WITHOUT FOUNDATION IN FACT
[001:31:00;239] AND THAT THERE IS NO REASON
[001:31:01;107] FOR REYNOLDS TO UNDERGO
[001:31:01;908] TREATMENT OF ANY SORT.

[001:31:21;092] RANCH.
[001:31:23;028] >> ACCORDING TO THE
[001:31:24;095] DOCUMENT, JACKSON THEN TOOK
[001:31:25;163] THE MINOR, THE MOTHER
[001:31:26;899] AND HIS HALF SISTER TO LAS
[001:31:27;966] VEGAS WHERE THEY WATCHED

[001:31:36;875] SLEEPING IN THE SAME BED
[001:31:38;376] WITH MR. JACKSON.
[001:31:40;546] FURTHER MINOR STATES,
[001:31:41;313] MOTHER WAS AWARE OF MINOR
[001:31:42;147] SLEEPING IN SAME BED
[001:31:42;881] AND ALLOWED THIS
[001:31:43;549] TO CONTINUE.
[001:31:44;149] >> AND IN THE DOCUMENT IT
[001:31:44;983] STATES THE MINOR VISITED
[001:31:45;784] JACKSON FREQUENTLY AND SLEPT
[001:31:50;155] IN HIS BED.
[001:31:51;222] JACKSON ALSO STAYED
[001:31:51;957] AT THE MINOR'S HOME.
[001:31:52;691] >> MINOR SAID AT FIRST
[001:31:53;459] MR. JACKSON WOULD,
[001:31:54;827] "CUDDLE" HIM AND KISS HIM
[001:31:56;795] ON THE CHEEK AND MINOR DID
[001:31:57;629] NOT FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
[001:31:58;564] WITH THIS.
[001:32:00;632] MR. JACKSON THEN BEGAN TO,
[001:32:02;233] "RUB UP AGAINST ME" WHILE
[001:32:04;202] SLEEPING IN BED.
[001:32:06;638] MINOR SAYS MOTHER STAYED
[001:32:07;573] IN GUESTHOUSE ON MICHAEL'S
[001:32:08;406] RANCH.
[001:32:09;307] SAYS OVER TIME
[001:32:10;375] MR. JACKSON "GRADUATED
[001:32:12;444] TO KISSING ME ON THE MOUTH.
[001:32:14;212] ONE TIME HE WAS KISSING ME
[001:32:15;781] AND PUT HIS TONGUE
[001:32:16;582] IN MY MOUTH.
[001:32:17;716] I SAID DON'T DO THAT.
[001:32:19;751] MR. JACKSON STARTED CRYING,
[001:32:21;519] I GUESS HE TRIED TO MAKE ME
[001:32:22;387] FEEL GUILTY".
[001:32:24;922] >> JACKSON ALSO TOOK
[001:32:27;058] THE CHILD, HIS MOTHER
[001:32:27;925] AND HALF SISTER ON A TRIP
[001:32:28;793] TO FLORIDA.
[001:32:30;028] IT WAS ON THAT TRIP
[001:32:30;996] ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENT
[001:32:32;663] THAT JACKSON'S ALLEGED
[001:32:33;431] ADVANCES PROGRESSED.
[001:32:35;666] >> HE "CONTINUED TO RUB UP
[001:32:37;469] AGAINST ME QUITE OFTEN."
[001:32:38;936] >> JACKSON ACCORDING
[001:32:41;172] TO THE DOCUMENT WOULD
[001:32:42;440] ALGEDLY BECOME AROUSED.
[001:32:44;675] >> HE BEGAN TO TELL
[001:32:46;077] THE MINOR THAT THEIR BEING
[001:32:47;345] TOGETHER WAS "IN THE COSMOS"
[001:32:49;314] AND "MEANT TO BE."
[001:32:57;122] >> IT WAS IN MONTE CARLO
[001:32:58;323] AT THE WORLD MUSIC AWARDS
[001:33:01;626] THAT JACKSON ACCOMPANIED
[001:33:03;361] THE MINOR THAT
[001:33:04;295] AN ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT
[001:33:05;130] TOOK PLACE.
[001:33:06;364] JACKSON ACCORDING
[001:33:07;065] TO THE DOCUMENT ALLEGEDLY
[001:33:07;899] SAYS THIS IS GOING TO BE
[001:33:09;267] GREAT AND AFTER THE ASSAULT
[001:33:10;135] HE SAID, WASN'T THAT GOOD.
[001:33:11;669] MINOR STATED THAT
[001:33:14;039] MR. JACKSON TOLD HIM THAT
[001:33:15;106] MINOR WOULD GO TO JUVENILE
[001:33:16;341] HALL IF HE TOLD.
[001:33:20;078] AGAIN IT MUST BE STATED THAT
[001:33:21;312] JACKSON IS CHARGED
[001:33:22;347] WITH NOTHING AND THERE IS
[001:33:28;586] NO PROOF OF ALLEGATIONS.
[001:33:34;592] BUT PSYCHOLOGIST DR. JOYCE
[001:33:35;427] BROTHERS ADDRESSES
[001:33:36;127] THE GENERAL QUESTION
[001:33:36;961] OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE.
[001:33:38;596] >> THERE ARE MANY REASONS
[001:33:39;431] WHY AN ADULT MIGHT BE
[001:33:40;197] SEXUALLY INTERESTED
[001:33:40;932] IN A CHILD.
[001:33:41;632] IT IS NOT NECESSARILY
[001:33:42;399] HOMOSEXUALITY.
[001:33:43;133] IT IS THAT THEY THINK
[001:33:43;935] OF THEMSELVES AS A CHILD.
[001:33:45;302] >> KIDS ARE ALLOWED TO NOT
[001:33:46;270] HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
[001:33:46;971] PRESSURES OF DIFFERENT
[001:33:47;738] THINGS.
[001:33:48;439] THEY GET TO BE HAPPY
[001:33:49;173] AND FREE.
[001:33:50;675] I THINK MICHAEL WISHES
[001:33:51;809] HE COULD HAVE THAT AGAIN.
[001:33:53;611] >> MEANWHILE, MICHAEL
[001:33:54;946] JACKSON CANCELED HIS SECOND
[001:33:56;146] CONCERT IN THAILAND
[001:33:57;448] WITH THIS RECORDED MESSAGE.
[001:34:00;918] >> TO ALL MY FANS

[001:34:06;290] YESTERDAY AS I'M SICK
[001:34:07;925] AND STILL UNDER TREATMENT.
[001:34:10;061] >> YOU'RE NEVER GUILTY
[001:34:11;896] BEFORE ANYTHING HAS BEEN
[001:34:13;130] PROVEN.

[001:34:17;534] SO, MIKE."
[001:34:19;804] >> AT THIS STAGE,
[001:34:21;338] THE INVESTIGATION HAS
[001:34:22;106] REPORTEDLY SPREAD

[001:34:31;816] JACKSON IN A HOT TUB
[001:34:32;549] WITH A BOY.
[001:34:34;384] WHAT THEY WERE DOING
[001:34:35;119] IN THE TUB, WE DON'T KNOW.
[001:34:36;621] BUT THE STORY NEVER SEEMS

[002:26:36;108] AND THEN KILL SOMEBODY
[002:26:36;108] THE WAY I DESCRIBED IT.

[002:26:44;617] MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
[002:26:44;617] YOU'RE COUNTING ON.
[002:26:46;619] WRITING THE BOOK
[002:26:46;619] GIVES YOU AN ALIBI.
[002:26:48;821] YES, IT DOES, DOESN'T IT?

[002:27:41;039] IN PSYCHOLOGY.
[002:27:43;008] IT GOES WITH THE TURF.
[002:27:44;509] GAMES ARE FUN.
[002:27:46;011] WHAT ABOUT BOXING?
[002:27:47;412] THAT'S A GAME.
[002:27:47;412] IS THAT FUN?
[002:27:49;447] I DON'T THINK
[002:27:49;447] THAT'S RELEVANT
[002:27:51;183] TO THIS INQUIRY.
[002:27:52;851] BOXING WAS FUN
[002:27:52;851] TILL MANNY DIED.
[002:27:55;487] HOW'D YOU FEEL
[002:27:55;487] WHEN HE DIED?
[002:27:58;356] I LOVED HIM.
[002:27:58;356] IT HURT.
[002:27:59;992] HOW'D YOU FEEL
[002:27:59;992] WHEN JOHNNY BOZ DIED?
[002:28:02;394] LIKE SOMEONE
[002:28:02;394] READ MY BOOK
[002:28:03;929] AND WAS
[002:28:03;929] PLAYING GAMES.
[002:28:05;430] BUT IT DIDN'T HURT.
[002:28:06;698] NO.
[002:28:07;833] BECAUSE
[002:28:07;833] YOU DIDN'T LOVE HIM,
[002:28:09;334] EVEN THOUGH
[002:28:09;334] YOU WERE FUCKING HIM.
[002:28:10;836] YOU STILL GET
[002:28:10;836] THE PLEASURE.
[002:28:12;337] DIDN'T YOU FUCK
[002:28:12;337] ANYBODY ELSE
[002:28:13;972] WHEN YOU WERE
[002:28:13;972] MARRIED, NICK?
[002:28:15;674] HOW'D YOU KNOW
[002:28:15;674] HE WAS MARRIED?
[002:28:17;442] MAYBE I WAS JUST GUESSING.
[002:28:19;845] WHAT DIFFERENCE
[002:28:19;845] DOES IT MAKE?
[002:28:25;684] WOULD YOU LIKE
[002:28:25;684] A CIGARETTE, NICK?

[002:28:41;399] HOW'D YOU MEET MR. BOZ?
[002:28:43;368] I WANTED TO WRITE A BOOK
[002:28:45;403] ABOUT THE MURDER
[002:28:45;403] OF A RETIRED ROCK STAR.
[002:28:48;406] I PICKED HIM UP
[002:28:48;406] AND HAD SEX WITH HIM.
[002:28:51;042] YOU DIDN'T FEEL
[002:28:51;042] ANYTHING FOR HIM.
[002:28:53;345] YOU JUST
[002:28:53;345] HAD SEX WITH HIM
[002:28:55;012] FOR YOUR BOOK.
[002:28:56;381] IN THE BEGINNING.

[002:29:41;125] THAT SETTLES IT.
[002:29:45;730] SHE'S LYING.
[002:29:46;931] FORGET IT. YOU CANNOT

[002:34:21;402] JUST TO GET OFF THE HOOK
[002:34:21;402] WITH INTERNAL AFFAIRS.
[002:34:24;405] HE AIN'T THAT WAY.

[002:36:29;863] SHE USED HER BOOK
[002:36:29;863] AS AN ALIBI.
[002:36:34;168] I MET HER AT BERKELEY.
[002:36:38;372] WE WERE IN SOME
[002:36:38;372] OF THE SAME CLASSES.

[002:37:06;967] WHO WAS I
[002:37:06;967] MAKING LOVE TO?
[002:37:08;936] YOU WEREN'T MAKING LOVE.
[002:37:15;075] I NEED A CIGARETTE.
[002:37:16;811] I THOUGHT
[002:37:16;811] YOU SAID YOU QUIT.
[002:37:24;418] IT'S THE TOP DRAWER
[002:37:24;418] IN THE FOYER.

[002:38:21;241] THE LINE OF FIRE.

[002:38:44;731] YOU WANT A NAME
[002:38:44;731] FROM THE PRESENT?
[002:38:47;199] HAZEL DOBKINS.
[002:38:48;401] NOAH GOLDSTEIN
[002:38:48;401] WAS MY COUNSELOR
[002:38:50;436] MY FRESHMAN YEAR.
[002:38:51;938] THAT'S PROBABLY
[002:38:51;938] WHERE I GOT THE IDEA
[002:38:54;907] FOR THE ICE PICK
[002:38:54;907] FOR MY BOOK.
[002:38:59;378] FUNNY HOW
[002:38:59;378] THE SUBCONSCIOUS WORKS.
[002:39:01;513] HILARIOUS.
[002:39:05;351] HAZEL'S MY FRIEND.

[002:39:09;355] UNDERSTAND
[002:39:10;923] HOMICIDAL IMPULSE.
[002:39:12;291] THOUGHT YOU WOULD'VE
[002:39:12;291] LEARNED THAT AT SCHOOL.
[002:39:16;295] ONLY IN THEORY.
[002:39:17;763] BUT YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT
[002:39:17;763] HOMICIDAL IMPULSE,
[002:39:21;367] DON'T YOU, SHOOTER?
[002:39:25;671] NOT IN THEORY.
[002:39:25;671] IN PRACTICE.
[002:39:28;441] WHAT HAPPENED?
[002:39:30;042] DID YOU GET
[002:39:30;042] SUCKED INTO IT?
[002:39:32;544] DID YOU LIKE IT TOO MUCH?
[002:39:36;949] I DON'T KNOW WHAT

[002:39:41;454] TELL ME ABOUT
[002:39:41;454] THE COKE, NICK.

[002:40:07;945] THEY NEVER TESTED YOU,
[002:40:07;945] DID THEY?
[002:40:11;916] INTERNAL AFFAIRS KNEW.
[002:40:16;454] YOUR WIFE KNEW, TOO,
[002:40:16;454] DIDN'T SHE?
[002:40:24;695] SHE KNEW
[002:40:24;695] WHAT WAS GOING ON.
[002:40:29;334] I THINK YOU GOT
[002:40:29;334] TOO CLOSE TO THE FLAME.
[002:40:39;777] I THINK YOU LIKED IT.
[002:40:46;351] THAT'S WHY
[002:40:46;351] SHE KILLED HERSELF.
[002:41:04;569] HI, HON.
[002:41:10;808] YOU TWO HAVE MET,

[002:43:01;885] HE DIDN'T BUY
[002:43:01;885] MY EVALUATION.
[002:43:04;420] HE SAID
[002:43:04;420] I WASN'T OBJECTIVE.

[002:58:10;185] TO HOLD ON TO THE TICKETS FOR
[002:58:11;819] THE POSTPONED CONCERT BECAUSE
[002:58:13;721] JACKSON WOULD BE BACK ON STAGE
[002:58:15;756] WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
[002:58:17;658] SANDRA HUGHES, CBS NEWS, LOS
[002:58:18;593] STORE'S SECURITY GUARDS ENGAGED
[002:58:22;597] IN VOYEURISM, SPYING ON HER AND
[002:58:24;365] OTHERS IN INAPPROPRIATE WAYS...
[002:58:27;469] THE EVIDENCE: OBSCENE SECURITY
[002:58:29;904] TAPES ...AND PEEPHOLES ABOVE
[002:58:32;207] NEWSCENTER FOUR'S VIC LEE HAS
[002:58:33;007] MORE...
[002:58:34;375] WHEN PENNEY'S INSTALLED THE
[002:58:35;276] SECURITY CAMERAS LAST NOVEMBER,
[002:58:37;579] THE STORE TOLD ITS WORKERS IT
[002:58:38;646] WANTED TO CUT DOWN ON
[002:58:40;148] SHOPLIFTING AND EMPLOYE THEFT.
[002:58:42;650] BUT THIS IS WHAT KATHERYN
[002:58:44;118] HERNANDEZ FOUND THEY WERE
[002:58:44;818] SHOOTING.
[002:58:47;687] HER BODY PARTS. THE CAMERA HAD
[002:58:48;688] ZOOMED IN ON HER CHEST ...
[002:58:49;990] STAYING FIXED THERE, EVEN WHILE
[002:58:51;024] SHE MOVED AROUND.
[002:58:54;361] THE TAPE LAST FOR SEVERAL
[002:58:55;095] MINUTES.
[002:58:56;463] SOT I FELT VIOLATED. I CANT
[002:58:57;964] BELIEVE SOMEONE WOULD HAVE NO
[002:58:59;433] RESPECT TO ANYONE TO DO THAT TO
[002:59:00;601] SOME ONE LIKE ME.
[002:59:03;337] MANY STORES NOW HAVE
[002:59:04;804] SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS. THIS ONE
[002:59:07;608] CAUGHT A FAMILY OF SHOPLIFTERS.
[002:59:10;344] THE MAN IN THE FRONT SHIELDS
[002:59:11;545] HIS PARTNERS WHILE THEY ARE
[002:59:13;913] STUFFING CLOTHES INTO A LARGE
[002:59:14;681] BAG.
[002:59:16;283] SO LARGE IN FACT, THEY HAVE TO
[002:59:17;117] PUSH IT TO THE DOOR, WHERE THEY
[002:59:17;917] ARE CAUGHT.
[002:59:20;120] STANDUP THERE APPEARS TO BE NO
[002:59:21;522] LAW THAT APPLIES DIRECTLY TO
[002:59:25;091] THE POSSIBLE ABUSES OF SECURITY
[002:59:25;892] CAMERAS.
[002:59:27;461] BUT IN THIS AGE OF HIGH TECH
[002:59:28;629] THESE CAMERAS CAN TILT, ZOOM,
[002:59:29;396] AND PAN.
[002:59:31;231] SO WHILE THEY ARE POWERFUL
[002:59:32;799] TOOLS FOR CRIME FIGHTING, IN
[002:59:34;234] THE WRONG HANDS THEY CAN BECOME
[002:59:39;273] CLIFF PALEFSKY, ATTORNEY FOR
[002:59:40;040] HERNANDEZ SAYS THERE'S A
[002:59:41;074] BROADER ISSUE HERE.
[002:59:44;211] SOT ITS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE
[002:59:46;679] A RECOGNITION OF THE POSSIBLE
[002:59:47;913] ABUSES AND HAVE POLICIES AND
[002:59:49;048] LAWS IN PLACE TO PROTECT
[002:59:50;015] AGAINST IT.
[002:59:55;321] TAKING PICTURES LIKE THESE,
[002:59:57;390] HERNANDEZ SAYS SHE LATER
[002:59:59;659] LEARNED THEY WERE DRILLING
[003:00:01;494] PEEPHOLES IN THE FITTING ROOM
[003:00:02;261] CEILINGS.
[003:00:02;961] SOT I THINK OF ALL THE
[003:00:03;696] CUSTOMERS I WAITED ON ALL THOSE
[003:00:04;697] FITTING ROOMS. I THINK ALL THE
[003:00:06;999] EMPLOYES WHO USE THE FITTING
[003:00:08;467] ROOMS. I HAVE USED THE FITTING
[003:00:09;968] ROOMS AND IT SCARES ME TO THINK
[003:00:12;171] THAT SOMEONE COULD HAVE SEEN ME
[003:00:13;005] WITHOUT ANY CLOTHES ON.
[003:00:17;376] KATHERYN HERNANDEZ GOT HER
[003:00:18;211] HANDS ON THAT TAPE THRU A
[003:00:19;845] FORMER EMPLOYE.
[003:00:22;014] J.C. PENNEYS CORPORATE OFFICE
[003:00:24;116] IN DALLAS DECLINED TO COMMENT
[003:00:27;220] THEY DO SAY THEY'RE
[003:00:28;321] INVESTIGATING AND LATE THIS
[003:00:29;589] AFTERNOON, THEY TOLD NC4 THEY
[003:00:31;924] HAVE FOUND PEEPHOLES IN THE
[003:00:34;193] CEILINGS OF DRESSING ROOMS.
[003:00:35;861] BUT NO TELLING WHO DID IT OR
[003:00:36;629] WHY.
[003:00:37;697] ARE THEY SUING FOR INVASION OF
[003:00:39;198] PRIVACY?
[003:00:58;784] BEGINNING TO EVALUATE A
[003:00:59;852] MONTH-LONG CRACK-DOWN ON THE
[003:01:01;053] STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO.
[003:01:03;122] AT THE HEIGHT OF TOURIST

[003:01:25;644] BASED ON REPORTS THEIR SO
[003:01:27;479] CALLED QUALITY OF LIFE
[003:01:29;381] ENFORCEMENT POLICY HAS WORKED

[003:01:47;699] WERE JUST TRYING TO KICK BACK
[003:01:48;466] AND SURVIVE.
[003:01:49;668] HOMELESS PEOPLE WE SPOKE WITH
[003:01:50;568] CALLED THE EFFORT A WASTE OF
[003:01:52;004] TIME AND UNFAIR. THIS CRACKDOWN
[003:01:52;938] CAME AT A TIME WHEN SHELTER

[003:04:33;663] THE PRO-174 CAMP SAYS PARENTS

[003:04:37;700] THEIR KIDS OUT OF SCHOOLS NOT

[003:04:39;936] THOSE AGAINST 174 ARGUE IT

[003:08:00;933] FOR DORSEY'S BACK PAIN.
[003:08:02;636] BUT DRUG AGENTS SEIZED
[003:08:03;803] EVERYTHING INCLUDING THEIR HOME

[003:08:19;752] BEEN TOTALLY WRONGED BY THE
[003:08:20;487] GOVERNMENT. HIS BLOOD PRESSURE
[003:08:21;488] IS GOING UP.. THIS HAS BEEN
[003:08:25;625] STAMATE'S SENTENCING HEARING
[003:08:26;393] IS LIKELY TO TAKE A FEW MORE
[003:08:27;160] DAYS.
[003:08:47;581] >> FENN CALLS IT THE MOST
[003:08:48;715] CHALLENGING ROLE SHE'S EVER

[003:08:51;984] >> IT REALLY SCARED ME.
[003:08:52;885] IT INTIMIDATED ME.
[003:08:53;587] I WASN'T SURE THAT I COULD
[003:08:54;421] DO IT, AND I TRY TO REACH
[003:08:55;488] FOR THINGS THAT CHALLENGE ME
[003:08:56;856] IN THAT WAY.
[003:08:58;291] >> STILL, THE STORYLINE WAS
[003:08:59;759] SO BIZARRE TO KIM BASINGER
[003:09:01;027] THAT SHE CHANGED HER MIND
[003:09:02;329] ABOUT STARRING IN THE FILM
[003:09:03;430] AND WAS SUED FOR BREACH
[003:09:04;231] OF ORAL CONTRACT.

[003:09:09;569] IN AN INTERVIEW SHORTLY
[003:09:10;370] AFTER THE VERDICT.
[003:09:14;006] >> THERE WAS NOT ONLY
[003:09:15;907] A WRITTEN CONTRACT,
[003:09:18;277] BUT NO ORAL CONTRACTS OR ANY
[003:09:19;378] KIND OF AGREEMENT.
[003:09:20;446] >> ALTHOUGH THE FILMMAKERS
[003:09:22;047] WON THE COURT CASE AGAINST

[003:23:59;049] CHARGED WITH SEXUALLY ABUSING A
[003:24:00;818] CHILD.

[003:24:07;591] ANYTHING.
[003:24:08;692] YOU NEVER TOUCHED THE CHILD IN

[003:24:16;533] GOD AS MY WITNESS, NOT ONCE.
[003:24:20;370] >> HORRIFIED BY THE CHARGES,
[003:24:22;272] PENARANDA JUMPED AT THE CHANCE
[003:24:28;045] WHICH ARE ADMITTED IN COURT,
[003:24:28;746] ADMINISTERED BY RICHMOND COUNTY
[003:24:29;647] DEPUTY SHERIFF GENE JOHNSON.
[003:24:30;781] >> IN MY OPINION, BASED ON THE
[003:24:31;682] POLYGRAPH TEST, HE IS NOT GUILTY
[003:24:33;283] OF WHAT HE IS CHARGED WITH.

[003:24:38;889] >> NO, SIR.

[003:24:46;563] >> HE WENT OFF THE RECORD, AND
[003:24:47;597] HIS COMMENT WAS, "GOD HELP ANY

[003:25:20;229] THE JURY, DEADLOCKED, REFUSED.
[003:25:21;430] AND AS DELIBERATIONS DRAGGED ON
[003:25:22;899] INTO THE EVENING, THE CROWD HERE

[003:25:34;944] THAT NIGHT AND HAD FOUND HIM NOT
[003:25:36;445] GUILTY, I BELIEVE IT WOULD HAVE
[003:25:38;147] BEEN A RIOT.
[003:25:42;085] THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.
[003:25:43;820] >> SIX YEARS EARLIER, RACIAL
[003:25:45;021] UNREST TOUCHED OFF A RIOT HERE,
[003:25:46;522] AND IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN,
[003:25:48;991] McDONNELL.
[003:25:50;893] >> I WAS IN FEAR OF THAT, TOO.
[003:25:51;961] >> I WAS APPREHENSIVE AND
[003:25:52;895] FEARFUL, TOO.
[003:25:54;296] >> DO YOU THINK THE JURY WAS
[003:25:55;231] INFLUENCED BY THE CROWD?
[003:25:56;933] >> I DON'T SEE HOW THEY COULD
[003:25:57;834] HELP BUT BE.
[003:25:59;235] I DON'T SEE HOW THEY COULD HELP
[003:26:00;269] BUT BE.
[003:26:01;537] >> AND JUROR JOHNNY RABOR SAYS
[003:26:02;271] THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
[003:26:04;874] THE JUROR MRS. WEBB TOLD THE
[003:26:06;508] OTHERS, "IF HE'S NOT FOUND
[003:26:07;910] GUILTY, THERE WILL BE A RIOT IN
[003:26:08;911] THIS TOWN."
[003:26:13;015] >> SHE SAID, "THEY'LL BURN THE
[003:26:13;916] TOWN DOWN."
[003:26:15;384] SHE SAID WORDS TO THAT EFFECT.
[003:26:18;221] >> IF YOU DON'T CONVICT HIM?
[003:26:22;457] >> WE TRIED TO ASK MRS. WEBB WHY
[003:26:23;558] THE JURY VOTED TO CONVICT
[003:26:25;460] PENARANDA, BUT SHE SLAMMED THE
[003:26:26;862] DOOR ON US.
[003:26:28;363] JUROR HERMAN LODGE, HOWEVER,
[003:26:29;497] INSISTS THE JURY WAS NOT
[003:26:30;999] INTIMIDATED.
[003:26:32;333] >> I WASN'T FRIGHTENED BY IT.
[003:26:34;035] >> IF THE CROWD HAD NOT BEEN
[003:26:35;070] THERE, WOULD THE JURY HAVE VOTED
[003:26:37;438] >> YEAH, I THINK IT WOULD HAVE.
[003:26:39;741] I THINK IT WOULD HAVE.
[003:26:41;476] >> AFTER THIS CONVICTION, LUIS
[003:26:43;178] PENARANDA HAD NUMEROUS CHANCES
[003:26:45;747] TO FLEE.
[003:26:47;883] >> I PLEADED WITH HIM.
[003:26:49;117] I SAID, "LET'S GO RIGHT NOW."

[003:26:57;425] THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF
[003:26:59;094] AMERICA.

[003:27:14;642] I'M LUIS PENARANDA.
[003:27:20;115] I'M NOT GUILTY OF ANYTHING.
[003:27:22;017] >> AND THE LONGER HE'S IN
[003:27:22;851] CUSTODY, THE BIGGER THE
[003:27:23;885] QUESTION: SHOULD HE BE?
[003:27:27;322] ON WHAT YOU KNOW NOW, YOU THINK
[003:27:29;291] HE'S NOT GUILTY?
[003:27:32;194] >> YEAH, I WOULD SAY SO.
[003:27:38;333] >> IN MYPINION, HE WAS
[003:27:38;967] INNOCENT.
[003:27:40;101] >> IN THE CASE OF LUIS

[003:28:58;611] IT'S THEN SAFE-T-MAN COULD

[004:05:03;453] JADE!
[004:05:14;364] YOU DID IT!

[004:05:15;933] THE HANDICAPPER!
[004:05:26;810] Rogor:

[004:05:37;153] YOU KNOW, ROGOR,
[004:05:37;153] THERE'S AN OLD SAYING--
[004:05:39;723] WHEN IT'S OVER, IT'S OVER.
[004:05:41;491] AND GUESS WHAT?
[004:05:44;294] IT'S OVER.

[004:06:43;218] THE FIRST HUMAN TITLEHOLDER
[004:06:43;218] IN OVER 50 YEARS.
[004:06:46;555] WHAT IS IN STORE FOR
[004:06:46;555] THIS YOUNG MAN, NO ONE CAN SAY
[004:06:50;292] BUT AS LONG AS THERE ARE
[004:06:50;292] STEVE ARMSTRONGS

[004:11:07;180] IN MARIN COUNTY... AUTHORITIES
[004:11:08;315] HAVE BROKEN UP WHAT THEY SAY IS
[004:11:10;417] A LARGE AND SOPHISTICATED
[004:11:11;351] MARIJUANA GROWING OPERATION.
[004:11:13;486] SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES YESTERDAY
[004:11:14;554] CONFISCATED APPROXIMATELY
[004:11:15;989] 1-THOUSAND MARIJUANA PLANTS
[004:11:17;157] FROM A BUILDING IN NICASIO.
[004:11:20;760] THEY ALSO ARRESTED 45- YEAR
[004:11:21;528] OLD ALAN AGER.
[004:11:23;329] POLICE SAY THE MARIJUANA HAD A
[004:11:25;799] STREET VALUE OF 600-THOUSAND
[004:11:26;566] DOLLARS.
[004:11:27;834] POLICE HAVE TURNED THE CASE
[004:11:28;735] OVER TO FEDERAL DRUG
[004:11:29;368] ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS FOR
[004:11:30;069] PROSECUTION.
[004:11:33;139] CONVICTED DRUG DEALERS OFTEN
[004:11:34;173] FACE MORE THAN JAIL SENTENCES
[004:11:34;941] AND FINES.
[004:11:36;776] FEDERAL LAW ALSO PERMITS
[004:11:38;010] OFFICIALS TO CONFISCATE PRIVATE
[004:11:39;946] PROPERTY USED IN CONNECTION
[004:11:40;680] WITH DRUG DEALS.
[004:11:43;182] THAT MAY BE PROMPTING SOME
[004:11:44;250] MARIJUANA GROWERS IN NORTHERN
[004:11:45;318] CALIFORNIA TO EMPLOY NEW
[004:11:46;453] STRATEGIES TO PROTECT
[004:11:48;154] THEMSELVES FROM SUCH PROPERTY
[004:11:48;922] SEIZURES.
[004:11:49;556] JIM VARGAS REPORTS.
[004:11:53;593] THIS IS ALL THE MARIJUANA THAT
[004:11:54;928] REMAINS IN THE HANDS OF MOUNT
[004:11:56;362] TAMALPAIS STATE PARK RANGERS.
[004:11:58;765] FEDERAL DRUG AGENTS HAVE THE
[004:11:59;532] REST.
[004:12:00;967] FOR TWO WEEKS ... STATE AND
[004:12:02;034] FEDERAL PARK RANGERS, DEA
[004:12:03;135] AGENTS, AND LOCAL SHERIFF'S
[004:12:04;103] DEPUTIES COMBED THE
[004:12:05;338] MOUNTAINSIDES, FERRETING-OUT
[004:12:06;439] WHAT ONE RANGER CALLS 'FARMS.'
[004:12:08;641] MORE FARMS THAN JOHN PELONIO
[004:12:09;709] HAS EVER SEEN ON THE MOUNTAIN
[004:12:10;477] BEFORE.
[004:12:13;012] John Pelonio/Park Ranger From
[004:12:14;080] what we've detected, quite a
[004:12:15;214] lot more than previous years.
[004:12:16;315] We're not sure if more people
[004:12:18;417] are growing it, if the same
[004:12:19;586] people are growing more of it,
[004:12:20;653] or we just didn't detect it in
[004:12:21;454] previous years.
[004:12:22;822] BUT, HE ADDS, IT MAY ALSO BE A
[004:12:23;890] NEW, WELL-THOUGHT OUT STRATEGY:
[004:12:26;025] AVOIDING THE LAWS THAT ALLOW
[004:12:27;093] AUTHORITIES TO CONFISCATE
[004:12:28;260] PRIVATE LANDS WHERE MARIJUANA
[004:12:29;028] IS CULTIVATED.
[004:12:31;564] So, if they come out to public
[004:12:32;599] lands they only lose their crop
[004:12:33;700] and whatever property they were
[004:12:34;801] using to cultivate the crop.
[004:12:37;036] THAT MAY BE A SMART STRATEGY BY
[004:12:38;137] THE GROWERS, BUT IT IS DAMAGING
[004:12:40;206] THE PARK, ACCORDING TO THE
[004:12:40;939] RANGER.
[004:12:42;475] PELONIO SAYS MARIJUANA FARMERS
[004:12:43;575] HURT THE PARK BY DIGGING HOLES,
[004:12:44;543] SPREADING FERTILIZER, AND
[004:12:46;778] SETTING TRAPS THAT KILL WILD
[004:12:47;546] ANIMALS.
[004:12:50;082] We have people out here setting
[004:12:52;251] traps, using poisons and other
[004:12:53;319] chemcials that could get into
[004:12:54;353] the ground water. They're
[004:12:55;521] killing our wildlife, they're
[004:12:56;622] cutting down trees and shrubs,
[004:12:57;723] and digging in the hillsides in
[004:12:58;690] order to plant their crop.
[004:13:00;826] Ranger Pelonio says
[004:13:01;560] confiscating the marijuana and
[004:13:02;361] the farming tools doesn't close
[004:13:03;162] the case. Investigators are
[004:13:03;896] following leads they hope will
[004:13:04;696] result with the arrests of the
[004:13:05;498] marijuana farmers. On Mt.

[004:13:14;240] HAD HER PUT ON WHAT'S
[004:13:15;441] CALLED A FATUIT.
[004:13:16;575] IT'SZNG TO SEE THE
[004:13:17;776] CHANGES IN HOW PEOPLE REACT
[004:13:20;479] LYNDAL MARKS REPORTS.
[004:13:22;781] >> DISCRIMINATION, NOA
[004:13:25;884] LAUGHING MATTER.
[004:13:26;852] >> WITH PEOPLE ALL OVER THE
[004:13:29;121] COUNTRY PROTESTING AGAINST
[004:13:30;889] DISCRIMINATION BASED ON
[004:13:31;857] SIZE, "A CURRENT AFFAIR"
[004:13:32;791] TOOK THE QUESTION TO THE
[004:13:33;692] STREET.
[004:13:34;160] TREATED DIFFERENTLY BED
[004:13:42;901] O SIZE.
[004:13:43;902] WE HIRED MODEL VALERIE
[004:13:45;271] PRIMO TO PLAY THE HEAVIEST
[004:13:46;605] ROLE IN HER LIFE BY WEARING
[004:13:48;740] A COSTUME THAT DRASTICALLY
[004:13:50;609] CHANGED HER APPEARANCE.
[004:13:51;444] >> WHEN I WENT OUT ON THE
[004:13:52;678] STREET THE FIRST TIME, I
[004:13:53;844] WAS VERY EXCITED.
[004:13:55;480] I WAS DYING FOR PEOPLE TO
[004:13:57;248] STARE AT ME, DYING FOR
[004:13:58;683] PEOPLE TO LOOK AT ME.
[004:14:00;251] THAT RAPIDLY CHANGED.
[004:14:01;352] >> WE TOOK VALERIE TO THE
[004:14:03;188] STUDIO OF RICHARD IT
[004:14:06;558] TORKUS.
[004:14:06;991] HE CREATED THE ILLUSION
[004:14:07;758] THAT VALERIE WAS 200 POUNDS
[004:14:09;327] HEAVIER THAN SHE REALLY
[004:14:10;428] IS.
[004:14:10;795] >> I WENT TO MCDONEAL'S
[004:14:12;530] WITH NO GUILT BEFORE THIS
[004:14:13;698] JOB.
[004:14:14;099] >> AND THEN IN AND OUT OF
[004:14:16;234] COSTUME IT WAS ON TO THE
[004:14:17;368] STREET.
[004:14:18;269] >> BEING A LARGE WOMAN, YOU
[004:14:19;704] HAVE TO SHOP JUST LIKE
[004:14:21;139] EVERYONE ELSE.
[004:14:21;706] SO I WAS STANDING IN FRONT
[004:14:23;308] OF A FOOD STORE WITH A
[004:14:24;476] COUPLE OF BAGS AND A
[004:14:25;510] PURSE.
[004:14:25;977] WHAT I BASICALLY DID WAS
[004:14:27;112] ASK PEOPLE TO HELP ME CARRY
[004:14:29;347] THE BAGS EIGHT BLOCKS.
[004:14:30;881] >> HEY, CAN YOU GIVE ME A
[004:14:32;450] HAND WITH THESE BAGS?
[004:14:33;551] EXCUSE ME?
[004:14:34;185] I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
[004:14:35;953] COULD HELP ME CARRY THESE
[004:14:37;255] EIGHT BLOCKS UP TOWN?
[004:14:38;689] NO?
[004:14:39;056] >> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
[004:14:40;291] >> EIGHT BLOCKS?
[004:14:42;093] >> YEAH.
[004:14:42;760] >> OH, NO, NOT ME.
[004:14:45;029] EIGHT?
[004:14:45;630] GET A CAB, LADY.
[004:14:47;198] >> WNT BACK TO THE SAME
[004:14:49;100] LOCATION AND DID THE SAME
[004:14:50;701] SHOPPING.
[004:14:51;603] BUT I WAS DRESSED AS MYSELF
[004:14:53;471] NORMALLY AND ASKED THE SAME
[004:14:54;972] QUESTION.
[004:14:55;507] AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW
[004:14:58;643] MANY YES, SIRES I GOT.
[004:15:00;311] I'M ACTUALLY GOING EIGHT
[004:15:01;679] BLOCKS UP.
[004:15:02;380] >> UP THAT WAY?
[004:15:03;581] >> YES.
[004:15:04;115] THANKS VERY MUCH.
[004:15:04;749] >> I HAVE A BAD BACK, BUT I
[004:15:06;351] WOULD BE HAPPY TO ATTEMPT
[004:15:08;119] ONE OR TWO.
[004:15:08;620] >> WELL, IF YOU HAVE A BAD
[004:15:10;622] BACK I DON'T WANT TO -- I'M
[004:15:12;989] GOING EIGHT BLOCKS.
[004:15:13;957] >> UPE?
[004:15:14;491] >> UP.
[004:15:15;759] YOU'RE SURE?
[004:15:16;326] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[004:15:17;961] >> EVEN WITH  BAD BACK. 
[004:15:20;096] >> EIGHT BLOCKS?
[004:15:21;165] >> UP.
[004:15:23;467] HOW FAR ARE YOU GOING?
[004:15:25;101] >> ONE. ñ?
[004:15:26;203] >> I HEARD PEOPLE SAYING
[004:15:29;072] I'M ONLY GOING ONE BLOCK
[004:15:30;740] BUT IF YOU'RE GOING EIGHT
[004:15:32;476] I'LL GO THE EXTRA SEVEN.
[004:15:34;578] WHEN I WAS IN THE FAT SUIT
[004:15:35;712] THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT FOR AN
[004:15:38;715] EXCUSE.
[004:15:39;316] THE CONCEPT WAS THAT I WAS
[004:15:40;684] LOCKED OUT OF MY CAR.
[004:15:41;785] I WAS CARRYING THIS COAT
[004:15:43;119] HANGER AND I WAS ASKING
[004:15:44;921] PEOPLE FOR ASSISTANCE TO
[004:15:46;223] HELP JIMMY THE LOCK.
[004:15:47;691] DO YOU KNOW HOW TO UNLOCK
[004:15:48;425] CAR DOORS?
[004:15:49;826] DO YOU KNOW HOW TO UNLOCK
[004:15:51;027] CAR DOORS?
[004:15:51;595] >> NO.
[004:15:52;529] >> EXCUSE ME, DO YOU KNOW
[004:15:53;830] HOW TO UNLOCK CAR DOORS?
[004:15:56;533] DO YOU KNOW HOW TO UNLOCK A
[004:15:58;202] CAR DOOR?
[004:15:59;503] I LITERALLY DID NOT GET ONE
[004:16:01;171] YES.
[004:16:01;572] WHEN I WAS FAT, NOTHING
[004:16:02;339] HAPPENED.
[004:16:02;806] BY FAR, THIS WAS ONE OF THE
[004:16:03;907] WORST SITUATIONS.
[004:16:05;108] I GOT NO HELP WHATSOEVER.
[004:16:06;476] AND WHEN I WAS IN MY SKINNY
[004:16:08;878] OUTCONSTITUENT, EVERYBODY
[004:16:10;347] HELPED ME.
[004:16:11;582] DO YOU GUYS KNOW ANYTHING
[004:16:13;383] ABOUT HOW TO --
[004:16:15;752] >> SORT OF --
[004:16:16;920] >> IT'S THOSE KIND OF
[004:16:17;954] BUTTONS, HUH?
[004:16:18;988] >> THOSE ARE REALLY HARD.
[004:16:20;156] >> WHAT'S THE HANDLE LOOK
[004:16:21;758] KE IN YOUR CAR?
[004:16:22;659] >> ARE YOU IN A RUSH?
[004:16:23;893] I DON'T MEAN TO BOTHER
[004:16:25;429] YOU.
[004:16:25;862] >> LET ME SEE.
[004:16:29;032] YOU'RE FINE.
[004:16:29;700] BUT I TELL YOU, WATCH.
[004:16:32;668] IT WORKED.
[004:16:33;703] >> WOW.
[004:16:35;304] >> I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.
[004:16:36;572] >> YOU HAVE?
[004:16:37;506] PEOPLE CAME OUT OF THE
[004:16:39;275] WALLS.
[004:16:39;709] THEY CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.
[004:16:40;777] THEY WANTED TO DO THINGS
[004:16:42;178] LIKE CALL THE COPS FOR ME,
[004:16:43;246] JIMMY THE LOCK,
[004:16:45;014] EVERYTHING.
[004:16:45;514] THERE'S THE DOOR LOCK RIGHT
[004:16:47;316] THERE.
[004:16:47;784] >> FINALLY VALERIE WAS
[004:16:50;653] JOINED BY ACTOR MICHAEL
[004:16:54;924] MAGUIRE.
[004:16:55;424] THEY TRIED TO GET INTO AN
[004:16:56;993] EXCLUSIVE NIGHTCLUB.
[004:16:57;994] >> THERE WAS A LINE AND A
[004:16:59;896] RAILING AROUND.
[004:17:00;463] THE GUY HAD UNHOOK IT AND
[004:17:02;732] SAID, GO RIGHT IN.
[004:17:04;333] WE WERE RIGHT INSIDE THE
[004:17:05;735] DOOR.
[004:17:06;535] >> ONLY MINUTES LATER WHEN
[004:17:08;171] WE GOT THEM INTO THEIR
[004:17:09;305] COSTUMES, IT WAS A
[004:17:09;906] DIFFERENT STOR
[004:17:10;774] >> WE WALKED UP TO THE SAME
[004:17:12;475] PEOPLE THAT WERE STANDIN
[004:17:13;777] THERE ANDO HEY
[004:17:15;211] BUT THE SHERIFF POINTS OUT HE'S
[004:17:16;913] HAVING A NEW JAIL BUILT. HE'S
[004:17:20;784] GOING TO HAVE TO HIRE 80 TO 90
[004:17:22;551] MORE PEOPLE TO RUN IT.
[004:17:26;555] AND HIS BUDGET IS GOING TO BE
[004:17:28;324] INCREASED BY 25 PERCENT."
[004:17:30;160] THE SHERIFF SAYS IT'S CHEAPER
[004:17:30;994] TO SEND FIRST TIME USERS TO
[004:17:31;828] REHABILITATION CENTERS.
[004:17:32;996] SOMETIMES IT COSTS UP TO 300
[004:17:33;930] DOLLARS A DAY TO KEEP SOMEONE
[004:17:34;697] IN JAIL.
[004:17:36;132] IN REHAB ITS ONLY 60 DOLLARS A
[004:17:38;301] DAY..AND THEY'RE KICKING THE
[004:17:39;903] HABIT.
[004:17:41;604] "WHERE AS IN JAIL ALL HE GETS
[004:17:42;638] ARE A BUNCH OF NEW FRIENDS WHO
[004:17:43;539] ARE BAD GUYS." BUT SOME LAWMEN
[004:17:44;340] SAY WE HAVENT WON BECAUSE THE
[004:17:45;108] WAR ISNT OVER YET.
[004:17:48;878] "BUT WE ARE SO MUCH BETER OFF.
[004:17:52;715] DRUG USE HAS FALLEN OFF. IF HE
[004:17:54;483] SAYS THE WAR ISNT WORKING HE'S
[004:17:55;651] GIVING UP TOO SOON."
[004:17:59;755] BUT THE SHERIFF SAYS THE STATE
[004:18:02;325] AND NATION COULD GO BROKE...
[004:18:03;292] BECAUSE OF ALL THE P.O.W.'S.
[004:18:07;896] IN SAN FRANCISCO MANUEL RAMOS R
[004:18:10;232] IS CALLED TACRINE . IT WILL BE
[004:18:11;334] SOLD BY WARNER-LAMBERT UNDER
[004:18:12;435] THE BRAND NAME COGNEX.
[004:18:13;536] CLINICAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN
[004:18:14;637] THAT IT HELPS SOME PATIENTS
[004:18:15;738] WITH MILD TO MODERATE CASES OF
[004:18:21;444] WHEN THE FDA APPROVES A NEW
[004:18:22;211] DRUG, IT'S ONLY AFTER IT'S BEEN
[004:18:23;011] THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW
[004:18:24;112] PROCESS, TO MAKE SURE IT'S SAFE
[004:18:25;247] AND DOES WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO
[004:18:26;382] DO. NOW THE FDA IS CONSIDERING
[004:18:27;483] NEW RULES REQUIRING FOOD
[004:18:28;517] SUPPLEMENTS, FROM
[004:18:29;618] MULTI-VITAMINS TO HERBAL
[004:18:30;720] EXTRACTS, TO PROVE THOSE
[004:18:31;787] PRODUCTS ARE SAFE AND
[004:18:32;755] EFFECTIVE.
[004:18:33;889] DR. DEAN EDELL JOINS US NOW.
[004:18:35;023] DEAN, THIS HAS STIRRED QUITE A
[004:18:35;725] CONTROVERSY.
[004:18:38;961] IT HAS INDEED. IN FACT, IF
[004:18:39;695] YOU VISIT YOUR LOCAL HEALTH
[004:18:40;429] FOOD STORE, YOU'LL SEE IT'S
[004:18:41;564] BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE THEY'RE
[004:18:42;365] FOOD STORE, YOU'LL SEE IT'S
[004:18:42;365] BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE THEY'RE
[004:18:42;365] GETTING READY FOR WAR.
[004:18:49;171] WHEN ANY OTHER PRODUCT MAKES
[004:18:49;938] A CLAIM, WE SAY "PROVE IT".
[004:18:50;673] BUT SOMEHOW FAT BUSTERS AND
[004:18:51;741] INTESTIN CLEANSERS ARE
[004:18:52;808] TREATED DIFFFERENTLY.
[004:18:53;909] James Attal/Whole Foods
[004:18:55;077] Market: "People should be aware
[004:18:56;178] of alternative ways to heal
[004:18:57;279] the body. And the information
[004:18:58;414] that research has provided
[004:18:59;482] should be available for
[004:19:00;549] consumers to make those
[004:19:01;484] choices."
[004:19:02;551] BUT ALL TOO OFTEN,
[004:19:03;652] ALTERNATIVE HAS SIMPLY MEANT
[004:19:04;854] UNPROVEN. NOW THE FDA IS
[004:19:05;855] RISKING A LONG, DRAWN-OUT
[004:19:06;989] BATTLE BY ASKING THE SUPPLEMENT
[004:19:08;123] INDUSTRY TO PLAY BY THE RULES.
[004:19:10;158] Janet MacDonald/FDA: "We are
[004:19:11;226] trying to call people's
[004:19:12;361] attention to what is going on
[004:19:13;496] with dietary supplements. We
[004:19:14;663] are going back to the snake oil
[004:19:15;730] era with some of the claims
[004:19:16;865] that are being made; everything
[004:19:17;999] from cancer to AIDS to multiple
[004:19:18;966] sclerosis."
[004:19:20;268] THE FDA HAS NOW MADE IT
[004:19:21;202] CLEAR TH WANT TO START SOME
[004:19:22;336] SORT OF REGULATION OF THE FOOD
[004:19:23;438] SUPPLEMENT INDUSTRY, WHICH
[004:19:24;606] UNNOW HAS REALIND
[004:19:25;673] FALLEN THROUGH THE CRACKS.
[004:19:26;775] UNLIKEEVERYTHING ELSE
[004:19:27;909] YOU CAN BUY, FROM PRESCRIPTION
[004:19:29;043] DRUGS TO HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES,
[004:19:30;177] SUPPLEMENTS DON'T HAVE TO BACK
[004:19:31;312] UP THEIR CLAIMS WITH RESEARCH.
[004:19:32;414] THE FDA WANTS TO CHANGE THAT.
[004:19:33;548] AND THE SUPPLEMENT INDUSTRY
[004:19:34;682] IS CIRCLING ITS WAGONS. THESE
[004:19:35;817] BLACK RIBBONS SYMBOLIZE THE
[004:19:37;151] INDUSTRY'S CLAIM THAT NEW RULES
[004:19:38;052] WILL KILL OFF MANY PRODUCTS.
[004:19:39;186] Mr. Attal: "The FDA requires
[004:19:40;288] a tremendous amount of
[004:19:41;389] research, maybe even in the
[004:19:42;524] millions of dollars to get one
[004:19:43;525] product to market.
[004:19:44;626] THE FDA SAYS IT DOESN'T
[004:19:45;760] NEED MILLION-DOLLAR RESEARCH;
[004:19:46;928] JUST ENOUGH TO SHOW PRODUCTS DO
[004:19:47;929] WHAT THEY CLAIM.
[004:19:48;996] Ms. MacDonald: "Drug
[004:19:50;164] approval process is quite a bit
[004:19:51;265] more strict than what would be
[004:19:52;600] necessary for dietary
[004:19:53;401] supplements. But it's
[004:19:54;502] certainly more than just
[004:19:55;637] anecdotes and testimonials."
[004:19:56;771] OBVIOUSLY, TENSIONS ARE HIGH
[004:19:57;906] IN THIS EMOTIONAL DEBATE AROUND
[004:19:59;040] A FOUR-BILLION DOLLAR MARKET.
[004:20:00;141] WE CAN ONLY HOPE THE TWO
[004:20:01;275] FACTIONS CAN FIND SOME MIDDLE
[004:20:02;410] GROUND, SO CONSUMERS WILL STILL
[004:20:03;511] HAVE A CHOICE; ONE BASED ON
[004:20:04;512] GOOD SCIENCE.
[004:20:42;950] CONGRESS TO
[004:20:44;385] CONGRESS TO
[004:20:44;385] REGULATIONS
[004:21:17;485] THE BAD FLATTERY
[004:21:17;485] IS ON THE HOUSE.
[004:21:19;820] THE TWO LOVELIEST
[004:21:19;820] CREATURES ON D.S. NINE.
[004:21:22;656] I MUST BE LIVING CORRECTLY
[004:21:22;656] TO BE SO...
[004:21:25;493] SO BLESSED.
[004:21:27;328] WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, MAJOR?
[004:21:29;463] GET LOST.
[004:21:34;701] AS YOU WISH.
[004:21:43;044] HOW ARE YOU, LIEUTENANT?
[004:21:46;047] YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY--
[004:21:48;382] PUT THE SHOE
[004:21:48;382] ON THE RIGHT FOOT FIRST
[004:21:51;718] BUT PUT THE LEFT FOOT FIRST
[004:21:51;718] INTO THE BATHTUB.
[004:21:57;058] I UNDERSTAND.
[004:21:59;060] BUT WHAT I
[004:21:59;060] REALLY MEANT WAS...
[004:22:03;063] ARE YOU HAPPY?
[004:22:05;398] THAT'S NOT A QUESTION
[004:22:05;398] I GET ASKED VERY OFTEN.
[004:22:09;069] OH, BUT IT SHOULD BE.
[004:22:11;071] IN MY OPINION
[004:22:12;405] YOU'RE THE MOST VALUABLE
[004:22:12;405] OFFICER ON THIS STATION.
[004:22:16;242] MAY I?
[004:22:17;744] PLEASE.
[004:22:24;885] NOT BAD.
[004:22:26;887] FOR QUARK.
[004:22:28;555] IT IS GOOD.
[004:22:33;159] I COULDN'T IMAGINE RUNNING
[004:22:33;159] THIS STATION WITHOUT YOU.
[004:22:37;064] ARE YOU TRYING
[004:22:37;064] TO TELL ME SOMETHING?
[004:22:40;567] ( sighing )
[004:22:42;402] MY DISAGREEMENT
[004:22:42;402] WITH SISKO
[004:22:44;237] OVER THE VALERIANS
[004:22:44;237] IS NO SECRET.
[004:22:46;573] WELL, YOU KNOW HOW HE GETS
[004:22:46;573] ONCE HE'S MADE A DECISION.
[004:22:50;243] YES. LIKE TALKING TO A STONE.
[004:22:53;346] I REMEMBER A TIME
[004:22:53;346] ON ROCHANI THREE
[004:22:56;950] WE WERE CORNERED
[004:22:56;950] BY A PARTY OF KALEANS
[004:22:59;620] WHO WERE NOT VERY HAPPY
[004:22:59;620] TO SEE US, BUT BENJAMIN...
[004:23:03;090] YOU TOLD ME THE STORY
[004:23:03;090] THIS MORNING.
[004:23:05;926] OH.
[004:23:07;761] I SUPPOSE I DID.
[004:23:12;866] IF YOU WERE TO TALK
[004:23:12;866] TO STARFLEET COMMAND
[004:23:16;103] TELL THEM HOW DISPLEASED
[004:23:16;103] THE BAJORANS ARE
[004:23:18;705] WITH SISKO'S HANDLING OF THIS.
[004:23:21;041] I KNOW THEY'LL LISTEN TO YOU.
[004:23:23;777] I WAS DECORATED
[004:23:23;777] ON MY VERY FIRST MISSION.
[004:23:28;281] THE ADMIRAL WAS A VULCAN.
[004:23:30;617] SO DURING
[004:23:30;617] THE PRESENTATION CEREMONY...
[004:23:33;620] DAX.
[004:23:35;622] WE HAVE TO KEEP
[004:23:35;622] THE VALERIANS HERE
[004:23:38;057] UNTIL WE CAN SEARCH THE SHIP
[004:23:38;057] AND CONFISCATE THE DOLAMIDE.
[004:23:41;961] YOU'VE GOT TO CONVINCE
[004:23:41;961] STARFLEET.
[004:23:44;730] IT'S FOR THE GOOD OF BAJOR...
[004:23:44;730] AND THE FEDERATION.
[004:23:48;334] I'VE BEEN FRIENDS
[004:23:48;334] WITH BENJAMIN SISKO
[004:23:52;672] FOR... MANY YEARS.
[004:23:56;142] IN MANY WAYS,
[004:23:56;142] HE'S LIKE A SON...
[004:24:00;213] OR A NEPHEW.
[004:24:02;882] SOME KIND OF CLOSE RELATIVE,
[004:24:02;882] ANYWAY.
[004:24:06;219] JADZIA, LISTEN TO ME.
[004:24:08;721] I'M GETTING RID OF SISKO,
[004:24:08;721] ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.
[004:24:13;359] DON'T FORCE ME
[004:24:13;359] TO GET RID OF YOU AS WELL.
[004:24:19;365] ( crashing )
[004:24:28;808] WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN US?
[004:24:30;810] LET ME GO!
[004:24:32;478] WH DID YOU HEAR?
[004:24:34;480] NOTHING.
[004:24:35;881] NOTHING AT ALL.
[004:24:44;857] O'BRIEN WILL NEED AT LEAST A DAY
[004:24:44;857] TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
[004:24:48;960] BY THEN, IT WON'T MATTER.
[004:24:52;598] YOU'RE GOING AFTER SISKO.
[004:24:55;267] AND O'BRIEN.
[004:24:58;237] EITHER WE GET A MORE REASONABLE
[004:24:58;237] COMMANDER FROM STARFLEET--
[004:25:01;840] SOMEONE WE CAN CONTROL--
[004:25:04;710] OR WE GO IT ALONE.
[004:25:06;978] WITH ME RUNNING THIS PLACE
[004:25:08;980] YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO
[004:25:08;980] WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.
[004:25:12;317] IF YOU WANT TO TOSS QUARK
[004:25:12;317] OUT ON HIS EARS
[004:25:15;320] TOSS HIM OUT.
[004:25:16;821] IF YOU WANT TO PROCLAIM
[004:25:16;821] MARTIAL LAW ON THE PROMENADE
[004:25:20;359] PROCLAIM IT.
[004:25:21;993] THIS STATION WILL BE YOURS
[004:25:21;993] TO PROTECT
[004:25:24;630] WITH NO INTERFERENCE.
[004:25:26;097] WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?
[004:25:30;669] ODO...
[004:25:32;371] I TRUST YOU MORE THAN ANYONE
[004:25:32;371] ON THIS STATION
[004:25:35;674] BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
[004:25:35;674] BE CORRUPTED
[004:25:39;010] BUT THIS I
[004:25:39;010] A DANGEROUS TIME
[004:25:43;014] AND I CAN'T TAKE
[004:25:43;014] ANY CHANCES, EVEN WITH YOU.
[004:25:46;117] WHEN THE TIME COMES
[004:25:50;021] YOU'LL KNOW IT.
[004:25:54;192] I'LL BE COUNTING ON YOU.
[004:25:59;598] TOO EXPECTS TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT
[004:26:00;766] WITHIN DAYS ON A FRAMEWORK FOR
[004:26:01;600] PEACE WITH ISRAEL.
[004:26:05;170] THE UNITED STATES RESUMED TALKS
[004:26:06;338] WITH THE P.L.O., AND PRESIDENT
[004:26:08;607] WITH "GUARANTEES."
[004:26:10;541] BUT AS BOB SIMON REPORTS FROM
[004:26:12;310] ISRAEL, THE HOPEFUL SIGNS CAME
[004:26:13;544] AMID DOUBTS, THREATS, AND MORE
[004:26:14;679] VIOLENCE.
[004:26:20;751] >> WHILE HISTORY WAS HAPPENING
[004:26:22;253] INSIDE THE PRIME MINISTER'S
[004:26:24;989] TRYING TO BLOCK ITS PATH,
[004:26:27;125] RIGHT-WING ISRAELIS, SETTLERS
[004:26:28;726] MAINLY, AFRAID THAT RABIN WAS
[004:26:31;696] SIGNING AWAY THE DEEDS TO THEIR
[004:26:33;198] LAND.
[004:26:34;933] ON PART OF THAT LAND, IN GAZA,
[004:26:36;600] MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALISTS WERE ON
[004:26:38;436] THE MARCH, CONVINCED THE P.L.O.
[004:26:43;674] BUT PRIME MINISTER SHIMON PERES
[004:26:44;809] DEFENDED THE PACT AS A TRIUMPH
[004:26:45;576] OF THE FUTURE OVER THE PAST.
[004:26:47;812] >> WHAT WE ARE TRYING SERIOUSLY
[004:26:49;814] TO DO IS GET RID OF THE
[004:26:51;449] POISONOUS PAST AND, TO USE A
[004:26:53;251] BIBLICAL PHRASE, TO RETURN TO
[004:26:57;255] >> IT WAS A CEREMONY OF
[004:26:58;789] RECOGNITION IN A FAR DEEPER
[004:27:00;024] SENSE THAN IS USUALLY CONVEYED
[004:27:01;226] BY THAT DIPLOMATIC PHRASE.
[004:27:03;594] FOR 45 YEARS, THE PALESTINIANS
[004:27:04;996] AND THE ISRAELIS HAVE REFUSED TO
[004:27:06;965] RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER'S EXISTENCE
[004:27:08;366] AS A NATION, AS A PEOPLE.
[004:27:10;101] THEY'VE BEEN WAGING WAR IN AN
[004:27:11;602] ATTEMPT TO OBLITERATE EACH OTHER
[004:27:15;673] IN 1948, WHEN THE BRITISH LEFT,
[004:27:16;975] THE PALESTINIANS TURNED DOWN AN
[004:27:18;309] OFFER TO SPLIT THE LAND WITH THE
[004:27:19;510] JEWS.
[004:27:21;912] THEY WENT TO WAR INSTEAD AND
[004:27:23;381] LOST.
[004:27:26;049] THE JEWS BECAME A NATION.
[004:27:27;485] THE PALESTINIANS BECAME
[004:27:30;821] IN 1964, THE P.L.O. WAS FORMED
[004:27:32;122] TO TURN THAT AROUND.
[004:27:34;825] IN 1967, THE WAR THAT WAS MEANT
[004:27:36;026] TO DO THAT BACKFIRED.
[004:27:37;895] LED BY A GENERAL NAMED YITZHAK
[004:27:39;764] RABIN, THE ISRAELIS CONQUERED
[004:27:41;265] MORE LAND.
[004:27:43;066] TWO YEARS LATER, YASSER ARAFAT
[004:27:44;502] TOOK OVER THE P.L.O. AND BECAME
[004:27:47;337] HIS DISCIPLES BLEW UP AIRPLANES,
[004:27:48;606] HIJACKED OTHERS, MURDERED
[004:27:54;311] CIVILIANS-- AMERICANS,
[004:27:55;379] EUROPEANS, AND ISRAELIS-- AND
[004:27:56;781] ATHLETES AT THE MUNICH OLYMPICS.
[004:27:59;182] THE WORLD WILL NOT HAVE A
[004:28:00;284] MINUTE'S PEACE, THE TERROR
[004:28:02;653] PALESTINIANS GET BACK THE LAND,
[004:28:03;854] ALL THE LAND.
[004:28:05;255] IN THEIR NATION-BUILDING
[004:28:06;390] ENTERPRISE, THE JEWS BEHAVED AS
[004:28:07;525] IF THERE WERE NO PALESTINIANS.
[004:28:09;192] IN FACT, THE EARLY ZIONISTS
[004:28:10;227] PROCLAIMED THIS REGION A LAND
[004:28:11;361] WITHOUT A PEOPLE FOR A PEOPLE
[004:28:12;329] WITHOUT A LAND.
[004:28:13;864] THEY DEFINED THEIR BORDERS WITH
[004:28:14;765] BULLDOZERS.
[004:28:16;534] THEY BUILT SETTLEMENTS ON ARAB
[004:28:19;503] WHILE THE P.L.O. MADE SPEECHES
[004:28:20;771] ABOUT DRIVING ISRAELIS INTO
[004:28:22;105] THE SEA, ISRAEL DID JUST THAT
[004:28:23;340] TO THE P.L.O.
[004:28:24;708] IT INVADED LEBANON IN 1982 WITH
[004:28:25;876] THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF CHASING
[004:28:27;044] ARAFAT OUT.
[004:28:28;546] IT SUCCEEDED.
[004:28:30;113] ARAFAT BOARDED A BOAT TO TUNIS.
[004:28:33;250] SOON, PRESUMABLY, HE WILL MOVE
[004:28:37;087] TODAY'S CEREMONY RECOGNIZED HIS
[004:28:38;388] RIGHT TO DO THAT, THE RIGHT OF
[004:28:39;489] HIS PEOPLE TO HAVE A HOME IN A
[004:28:40;590] SMALL PART OF THE LAND WHICH TWO
[004:28:41;825] PEOPLES CLAIMED AS THEIR OWN.
[004:28:46;830] BOB SIMON, CBS NEWS, TEL AVIV.
[004:28:49;199] >> MOST OF THE WORLD IS
[004:28:51;701] AS A HISTORIC STEP FORWARD,
[004:28:52;735] AT LEAST A HOPE FOR PEACE.
[004:28:55;205] BUT IN THE MIDDLE EAST,
[004:28:56;340] HARD-LINERS ON BOTH SIDES
[004:28:57;341] ARE VOWING TO WRECK IT.
[004:29:00;978] CORRESPONDENT ALLEN PIZZEY
[004:29:01;945] HAS MORE ON THAT.
[004:29:05;349] >> ONE MAN WHO WON'T GET PEACE
[004:29:10;620] RADICAL PALESTINIANS TODAY
[004:29:11;788] DECLARED A DEATH SENTENCE
[004:29:13;457] ON HIM.
[004:29:16;159] EVEN THOSE WHO BACK ARAFAT SAY
[004:29:17;427] THERE HAS TO BE MORE THAN PEACE.
[004:29:19;929] THIS IS WHAT PALESTINIANS WANT,
[004:29:20;964] A PASSPORT FOR THEIR OWN STATE
[004:29:22;065] TO REPLACE THE ONE THEY LOST
[004:29:25;202] >> I WANT TO SAY I AM A
[004:29:26;370] PALESTINIAN, AND THIS AGAIN
[004:29:27;737] TO BE KNOWN FOR EVERYBODY.
[004:29:30;907] I DON'T LIKE TO FEEL AS IF I AM
[004:29:32;009] A STRANGER COMING FROM A NEW
[004:29:32;976] PLANET.
[004:29:36;279] >> AS REFUGEES, PALESTINIANS
[004:29:37;147] HAVE FEW LEGAL RIGHTS.
[004:29:40;683] PEACE WILL DEPEND VERY MUCH ON
[004:29:42;185] THE ABILITY OF ISRAEL'S ARAB
[004:29:43;820] NEIGHBORS TO GIVE THOSE
[004:29:44;988] PALESTINIANS WHO DON'T RETURN TO
[004:29:46;156] WHATEVER STATE EMERGES FROM THE
[004:29:47;257] PEACE DEAL A STATUS OTHER THAN
[004:29:48;425] REFUGEE.
[004:29:51;461] ISRAEL'S ACCEPTANCE OF A
[004:29:52;562] PALESTINIAN STATE IS CRUCIAL
[004:29:53;497] TO THAT.
[004:29:56;866] HAVE THEIR OWN AGENDAS WITH
[004:29:57;934] ISRAEL, AND THE PALESTINIANS
[004:29:58;968] ARE BARGAINING CHIPS.
[004:30:00;970] JORDAN HAS THE MOST ACUTE
[004:30:01;738] PROBLEM.
[004:30:04;040] 60% OF KING HUSSEIN'S SUBJECTS
[004:30:05;074] ARE PALESTINIAN.
[004:30:07;209] HE WILL LINK ANY PEACE AGREEMENT
[004:30:08;377] TO ISRAELI ASSURANCES THAT A
[004:30:09;512] FUTURE PALESTINIAN STATE WON'T
[004:30:10;547] AFFECT HIS DELICATE POLITICAL
[004:30:13;917] SYRIA IS INTERESTED IN A PEACE
[004:30:14;984] DEAL THAT WILL GET BACK THE
[004:30:15;818] GOLAN HEIGHTS.
[004:30:18;087] SYRIAN PRESIDENT HAFEZ AL-ASSAD
[004:30:19;221] ISN'T OPPOSING THE ARAFAT-
[004:30:20;489] ISRAELI DEAL NOW, BUT HE STILL
[004:30:21;624] HOSTS RADICAL PALESTINIAN
[004:30:22;725] FACTIONS WHO COULD WRECK THE
[004:30:23;960] PEACE PLAN UNLESS HE GETS WHAT
[004:30:25;227] HE WANTS, INCLUDING CONTINUED
[004:30:26;629] INFLUENCE IN LEBANON, WHICH IS
[004:30:34;804] UNTIL THE ISRAELIS LEAVE,
[004:30:35;838] THE RADICAL HEZBOLLAH WILL FIGHT
[004:30:36;940] THEM, HAMPERING THE LEBANESE
[004:30:38;107] GOVERNMENT'S EFFORTS TO FIND
[004:30:39;208] FOREIGN INVESTMENT TO REBUILD
[004:30:40;342] THE WAR-SHATTERED ECONOMY.
[004:30:43;913] SO LEBANON WON'T DO A UNILATERAL
[004:30:49;652] >> WE HAVE AGREED WITH SYRIA
[004:30:50;687] THAT A PEACE TREATY WILL BE
[004:30:51;854] SIGNED TOGETHER.
[004:30:55;658] >> YASSER ARAFAT LOOKS LIKE A
[004:30:56;759] BIGGER INSURANCE RISK THAN EVER,
[004:30:58;027] AND THAT MEANS THE FUTURE OF
[004:30:59;095] PEACE STILL COMES WITH A HIGH
[004:31:02;899] ALLEN PIZZEY, CBS NEWS, BEIRUT.
[004:31:05;802] >> PRESIDENT CLINTON MADE IT
[004:31:06;936] CLEAR AGAIN TODAY THAT THE
[004:31:08;037] UNITED STATES WILL BE A KEY
[004:31:09;171] PLAYER, NOT ONLY IN PLAYING HOST
[004:31:10;339] TO MONDAY'S PEACE AGREEMENT
[004:31:11;540] CEREMONY, BUT ALSO ENSURING
[004:31:12;874] THE PEACE ON THE GROUND.
[004:31:18;380] BRAVER HAS THE LATEST ON THAT.
[004:31:21;617] >> ACCOMPANIED BY HIS SECRETARY
[004:31:22;818] OF STATE, PRESIDENT CLINTON
[004:31:23;852] APPEARED ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN
[004:31:24;920] TODAY TO MAKE THE FORMAL
[004:31:26;088] ANNOUNCEMENT.
[004:31:28;524] >> IN LIGHT OF THIS WEEK'S
[004:31:29;758] EVENTS, I HAVE DECIDED TO RESUME
[004:31:30;859] THE DIALOGUE AND THE CONTACTS
[004:31:32;027] BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND
[004:31:36;865] >> AND THOUGH THE U.S. WAS LEFT
[004:31:37;933] OUT OF THE SECRET NEGOTIATIONS
[004:31:39;067] BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE P.L.O.,
[004:31:40;302] THE PRESIDENT SAID THERE WILL BE
[004:31:41;437] GUARANTEES TO ENSURE PEACE.
[004:31:45;541] >> THE UNITED STATES WILL
[004:31:46;975] CONTINUE TO BE A FULL AND AN
[004:31:48;277] ACTIVE PARTNER IN THE
[004:31:51;213] ENSURE THAT THIS PROMISE OF
[004:31:52;248] PROGRESS IS FULLY REALIZED.
[004:31:54;183] >> EARLIER THE PRESIDENT MET
[004:31:57;319] WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, WHO
[004:31:59;388] EXPRESSED BROAD SUPPORT FOR
[004:32:00;956] THE PEACE AGREEMENT,
[004:32:02;224] BUT ACKNOWLEDGED IT WILL BE
[004:32:03;492] EXPENSIVE FOR THE U.S. AND
[004:32:04;560] OTHER NATIONS TO FUND SECURITY
[004:32:07;429] >> EVERYBODY IS GOING TO LOOK TO
[004:32:08;764] THE UNITED STATES AS BEING THE
[004:32:10;399] PRINCIPAL GUARANTOR AND THE
[004:32:11;833] PRINCIPAL MODERATOR OF WHAT IS
[004:32:13;935] GOING TO BE A PEACE IN ISRAEL
[004:32:15;171] AND IN THE WEST BANK, AND THAT
[004:32:16;338] WILL COST SOME MONEY.
[004:32:21;076] >> ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE EN ROUTE
[004:32:23;412] CALLED PAST PRESIDENTS AND
[004:32:24;446] INVITED THEM TO MONDAY'S
[004:32:25;414] WHITE HOUSE SIGNING CEREMONY.
[004:32:28;717] >> I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF
[004:32:29;785] HARD TIMES TO BE FACED IN THE
[004:32:30;919] FUTURE, BUT THIS HAS NOW BROKEN
[004:32:31;953] THE ICE.
[004:32:35;691] >> AND THIS WILL BE A BIG TEST
[004:32:36;692] FOR A PRESIDENT WHO HAS BEEN
[004:32:37;625] PEGGED AS WEAK ON FOREIGN
[004:32:40;762] >> EVERY AMERICAN PRESIDENT WHO
[004:32:41;763] GETS ELECTED, WHETHER HE LIKES
[004:32:42;964] IT OR NOT, WHETHER HE KNOWS IT
[004:32:44;265] OR NOT, IS REALLY A VICEROY FOR
[004:32:45;867] THE MIDDLE EAST.
[004:32:49;004] THE PROBLEMS OF THE MIDDLE EAST
[004:32:50;138] WILL ALWAYS END UP ON THE DESK
[004:32:51;306] OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT.
[004:32:55;944] LEADERS OF SYRIA, LEBANON, AND
[004:32:57;112] OTHER MIDDLE EASTERN NATIONS,
[004:32:58;146] EXPRESSING HOPE THAT THE
[004:32:59;414] HISTORIC P.L.O.-ISRAELI ACCORD
[004:33:00;615] WILL "FACILITATE" PROGRESS IN
[004:33:13;161] STRAIGHT AHEAD ON TONIGHT'S
[004:33:14;329] "CBS EVENING NEWS", THE FIRST
[004:33:15;396] LADY'S HEALTH CARE REVOLUTION.
[004:33:17;265] CBS NEWS HAS SOME EXCLUSIVE
[004:33:23;538] DETAILS.aERé//N THS
[004:33:28;977] AND CBS NEWS HAS NOW LEARNED KEY
[004:33:30;345] DETAILS ABOUT HOW THE CLINTON
[004:33:31;847] PLAN WOULD PAY FOR HEALTH CARE
[004:33:45;393] CORRESPONDENT LINDA DOUGLASS
[004:33:46;293] SHAKES LOOSE THE DETAILS.
[004:33:49;230] >> BEFORE A GROUP OF STATE
[004:33:50;798] LEGISLATORS, THE FIRST LADY
[004:33:52;233] OUTLINED THE CLINTON HEALTH CARE
[004:33:53;500] REVOLUTION, RADICAL CHANGES IN
[004:33:54;668] EVERYTHING FROM HEALTH CARE
[004:33:55;702] PRIORITIES TO FUNDING.
[004:33:58;272] HEALTH PLAN, OBTAINED BY CBS
[004:33:59;406] NEWS, MAKES CLEAR FOR THE FIRST
[004:34:00;607] TIME THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
[004:34:01;475] WILL REGULATE INSURANCE RATES.
[004:34:04;178] >> WHAT WE DO THEN IS TO HAVE A
[004:34:05;379] BUDGET AS A CAP OR A DISCIPLINE
[004:34:06;546] OVER THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
[004:34:08;883] >> ACCORDING TO THE DRAFT PLAN,
[004:34:10;050] THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD
[004:34:11;252] CALCULATE A PRICE RATE FOR
[004:34:12;452] INSURANCE PREMIUMS IN EACH
[004:34:15;022] INSURANCE PLANS THAT EXCEED
[004:34:16;523] THAT RATE WOULD BE PENALIZED.
[004:34:18;292] CRITICS, INCLUDING DEMOCRATS,
[004:34:19;559] SAY THE PLAN SOUNDS SUSPICIOUSLY
[004:34:20;761] LIKE PRICE CONTROLS, WHICH THE
[004:34:22;429] CLINTONS PROMISED TO AVOID.
[004:34:23;931] >> A PRICE CONTROL IS A PRICE
[004:34:24;765] CONTROL.
[004:34:26;066] IF YOU HAVE A BUREAUCRAT IN
[004:34:26;767] CHARGE, YOU HAVE A BUREAUCRAT
[004:34:27;501] IN CHARGE, AND THESE ARBITRARY
[004:34:30;637] END UP HURTING AMERICAN
[004:34:32;006] CONSUMERS.
[004:34:34;041] >> THE CLINTON PLAN ALSO CALLS
[004:34:35;109] FOR CAPS ON SOME DRUG PRICES AND
[004:34:36;076] AT THE SAME TIME GIVES STATES
[004:34:37;244] THE RIGHT TO SET SOME DOCTORS'
[004:34:38;345] FEES.
[004:34:40;281] REPUBLICAN SENATOR JOHN CHAFFEE,
[004:34:41;448] A HEALTH REFORM ADVOCATE, WARNED
[004:34:42;582] MANY IN CONGRESS WILL STRONGLY
[004:34:43;583] OPPOSE TOO MUCH GOVERNMENT
[004:34:46;486] >> I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS THAT
[004:34:47;354] SETS THE RATES.
[004:34:49;290] INEVITABLY I THINK THERE'S GOING
[004:34:50;124] TO BE UNFAIRNESS IN THOSE RATES.
[004:34:52;459] >> THE FIRST LADY WARNED THAT
[004:34:53;560] WITHOUT STRINGENT COST CONTROLS
[004:34:54;728] HEALTH CARE SPENDING WILL
[004:34:55;830] BANKRUPT THE NATION.
[004:34:58;299] >> WHAT WE ARE NOT OPEN TO IS A
[004:35:03;938] RECOGNIZE THE REALITY OF THE
[004:35:05;172] PROBLEM FACING THIS COUNTRY,
[004:35:07;074] BOTH IN HUMAN AND ECONOMIC
[004:35:08;642] TERMS.
[004:35:12;111] >> NEXT MONTH THE CLINTONS WILL
[004:35:13;513] BEGIN BARNSTORMING THE NATION,
[004:35:15;281] ARGUING THAT AMERICANS PAY MORE
[004:35:16;550] FOR HEALTH CARE AND ARE LESS
[004:35:19;453] NATIONS.
[004:35:22;188] MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WON'T ARGUE
[004:35:23;357] WITH THAT, BUT THEY WILL LIKELY
[004:35:25;024] PICK APART MOST OF THE CLINTONS'
[004:35:26;125] SOLUTIONS.
[004:35:27;361] LINDA DOUGLASS, CBS NEWS,
[004:35:28;094] WASHINGTON.
[004:35:30;397] >> IT'S NO SECRET THAT A KEY
[004:35:31;531] GOAL OF HEALTH CARE REFORM IS TO
[004:35:32;666] GIVE MEDICAL COVERAGE TO
[004:35:33;867] MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO NOW
[004:35:36;436] NONE.
[004:35:38;372] CBS NEWS HAS LEARNED THE PLAN
[004:35:39;806] WOULD ALSO COVER MILLIONS OF
[004:35:41;341] AMERICANS WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY
[004:35:42;809] APPLIED FOR MEDICAL INSURANCE
[004:35:44;043] BUT BEEN TURNED DOWN.
[004:35:45;545] CBS NEWS HEALTH CORRESPONDENT
[004:35:46;847] DR. BOB ARNOT HAS THAT PART
[004:35:53;052] >> KAITLIN FRANCIS IS A NORMAL
[004:35:54;320] 2½-YEAR-OLD IN EVERY WAY EXCEPT
[004:35:55;622] ONE: SHE WAS BORN WITH ONLY
[004:35:57;090] ONE EAR AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
[004:35:58;692] SHE IS CONSIDERED UNTREATABLE.
[004:36:03;963] >> I CAN'T GET INSURANCE FOR
[004:36:05;064] HER, NOT EVEN SOMETHING AS
[004:36:06;099] SIMPLE AS HER MEDICAL CHECKUP
[004:36:09;736] >> KAITLIN HAS WHAT THE
[004:36:10;837] INSURANCE INDUSTRY CALLS A
[004:36:11;905] PREEXISTING MEDICAL CONDITION,
[004:36:13;206] A MEDICAL PROBLEM THAT IS KNOWN
[004:36:14;374] AT THE TIME SOMEONE APPLIES FOR
[004:36:15;475] INSURANCE.
[004:36:17;711] IT'S OFTEN THE REASON COMPANIES
[004:36:19;178] DENY COVERAGE, CLAIMING IT'S TOO
[004:36:20;313] COSTLY.
[004:36:24;751] FIVE MILLION AMERICANS A YEAR
[004:36:26;152] ARE DENIED HEALTH COVERAGE ON
[004:36:27;587] THE BASIS OF PREEXISTING MEDICAL
[004:36:29;822] CONDITIONS, WHICH INCLUDE EVEN
[004:36:31;390] THE MOST COMMON HEALTH PROBLEMS,
[004:36:33;025] LIKE CANCER, HEART DISEASE,
[004:36:34;527] HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, ARTHRITIS,
[004:36:36;261] DIABETES, PLUS MANY GENETIC
[004:36:37;296] DISEASES.
[004:36:41;867] PLAN WILL BAN PREEXISTING
[004:36:43;101] MEDICAL CONDITIONS AS REASONS
[004:36:44;269] FOR DENYING HEALTH COVERAGE.
[004:36:47;005] >> ALL OF US WANT TO ELIMINATE
[004:36:48;307] PREEXISTING CONDITIONS BECAUSE
[004:36:49;975] WE THINK THAT EVERY AMERICAN
[004:36:51;510] OUGHT TO BE COVERED, NOT SIMPLY
[004:36:52;745] THOSE WHO ARE PERFECT FROM
[004:36:54;146] A HEALTH POINT OF VIEW.
[004:36:57;917] AGREES THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE
[004:36:58;918] CHANGED.
[004:37:01;320] >> THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TO
[004:37:02;455] SET FORTH A UNIFORM SET OF
[004:37:03;522] GROUND RULES THAT ALL INSURERS
[004:37:04;590] AND ALL EMPLOYERS HAVE TO ABIDE
[004:37:05;991] BY.
[004:37:11;497] >> BUT THERE'S STILL NO HELP FOR
[004:37:14;232] FRANCIS.
[004:37:15;901] HER PARENTS CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY
[004:37:17;102] FOR RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY,
[004:37:18;103] WHICH THEY SAY IS ESSENTIAL FOR
[004:37:19;237] KAITLIN'S EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT.
[004:37:22;274] >> I FEEL FRUSTRATED.
[004:37:23;809] I FEEL ANGRY.
[004:37:25;711] I FEEL PAIN FOR THIS LITTLE GIRL
[004:37:33;486] >> BUT ONE BIG QUESTION REMAINS.
[004:37:35;621] WILL HEALTHY AMERICANS BE
[004:37:37;255] WILLING TO PAY HIGHER TAXES OR
[004:37:38;457] HIGHER PREMIUMS SO THAT THOSE IN
[004:37:39;625] GREATER NEED OF MEDICAL CARE CAN
[004:37:40;793] GET THE HELP THEY REALLY NEED?
[004:37:42;194] DR. BOB ARNOT, CBS NEWS,
[004:37:48;065] >> WHEN IT COMES TO PREVENTING
[004:37:49;433] ILLNESS, A LOT OF AMERICANS
[004:37:51;135] APPARENTLY COULD BE DOING A LOT
[004:37:52;269] MORE TO BE HEALTHY.
[004:37:54;305] IN THE LARGEST STUDY OF ITS
[004:37:55;740] KIND, RESEARCHERS FOUND EARLY
[004:37:56;941] SIGNS OF HEART DISEASE WERE
[004:37:58;175] RAMPANT EVEN AMONG TEENAGERS,
[004:38:04;315] THESE FINDINGS WERE BASED ON
[004:38:06;017] AUTOPSIES.
[004:38:07;385] MICHIGAN'S DR. JACK KEVORKIAN
[004:38:08;653] HAS ATTENDED ANOTHER SUICIDE,
[004:38:09;654] HIS 18th.
[004:38:12;857] HE WAS PRESENT IN SUBURBAN
[004:38:14;091] DETROIT WHEN A 73-YEAR-OLD MAN
[004:38:15;426] SUFFERING FROM BONE CANCER
[004:38:17;294] TOOK HIS OWN LIFE LAST NIGHT.
[004:38:19;831] ETHNIC MINORITIES, ESPECIALLY
[004:38:21;566] AFRICAN AMERICANS, HAVE FOUGHT
[004:38:23;034] TO REDRAW CONGRESSIONAL MAPS,
[004:38:24;769] GIVING THEMSELVES A PIPELINE TO
[004:38:26;004] POWER.
[004:38:28;840] NOW SOME AMERICANS ARE FIGHTING
[004:38:30;107] BACK AND THE COURTS ARE

[004:38:42;353] STRANGE SPOT FOR A PHOTO-OP WITH

[004:38:45;189] THROUGH ONE OF THE ODDEST-SHAPED
[004:38:46;791] CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS IN THE
[004:38:48;826] COUNTRY, A DISTRICT THAT HAS
[004:38:52;196] ROLE OF RACE IN POLITICS.
[004:38:55;700] >> IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE
[004:38:57;068] BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO DO
[004:38:58;402] WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET A BLACK
[004:39:00;071] OFFICIAL ELECTED, AND I DON'T
[004:39:01;405] THINK THAT'S NECESSARY.

[004:39:24;195] MEANDERING 170 MILES, IT BEGINS
[004:39:25;829] TO LOOK, SOME PEOPLE THINK, LIKE
[004:39:27;364] A LIZARD, MAYBE A KETCHUP BLOB,
[004:39:29;032] OR HOW ABOUT A BUG ON YOUR
[004:39:30;167] WINDSHIELD?
[004:39:32;203] HERE AT ITS NARROWEST POINT,
[004:39:33;637] THE DISTRICT RUNS RIGHT DOWN
[004:39:34;838] INTERSTATE 85.
[004:39:36;207] IN FACT, THE DISTRICT IS
[004:39:37;074] INTERSTATE 85.
[004:39:38;375] THAT'S LED TO A LOCAL JOKE THAT
[004:39:40;711] WITH YOUR CAR DOORS OPEN, YOU
[004:39:42;012] CAN KILL HALF THE PEOPLE IN THE
[004:39:43;581] DISTRICT.

[004:39:51;222] APARTHEID."
[004:39:52;556] IT ORDERED A LOWER COURT TO HEAR
[004:39:53;790] A LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY SIX LOCAL
[004:39:59;263] >> THE DISTRICT WAS CREATED FOR
[004:40:00;931] ONE GROUP AND EFFECTIVELY CUTS
[004:40:02;699] OUT THE OTHER GROUPS OF PEOPLE
[004:40:04;401] IN THAT DISTRICT.
[004:40:06;237] >> WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DO IT
[004:40:06;937] FOR RACIST REASONS.
[004:40:09;507] WE DID IT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T
[004:40:10;674] THINK IT WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY
[004:40:14;545] >> WATT'S DEFENDERS NOTE THAT
[004:40:15;712] ODDLY SHAPED DISTRICTS PROTECTED
[004:40:17;014] WHITE INCUMBENTS FOR YEARS WITH
[004:40:18;249] FEW COMPLAINTS.
[004:40:21;084] WHILE THE DISTRICT MAY LOOK
[004:40:22;353] FUNNY, THEY ADD, IT GIVES
[004:40:23;521] INNER-CITY MINORITIES A VOICE
[004:40:25;122] THEY OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE.
[004:40:29;860] BUT I AM JUST NOT ABLE TO BUY
[004:40:30;593] THE MEDICINE.
[004:40:32;763] >> WELL, NONE OF THIS MEDICINE
[004:40:33;897] IS COVERED UNDER MEDICARE?
[004:40:35;231] >> NO.
[004:40:39;235] >> BY THEM BEING BLACK, THEY
[004:40:40;937] SEEM TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE
[004:40:42;072] BLACK PROBLEM, YOU KNOW?
[004:40:43;907] THEY UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THEY
[004:40:47;510] >> BUT UNDERSTANDING WAS NOTABLY
[004:40:48;511] LACKING WHEN WATT DROPPED BY
[004:40:49;479] THE LOCAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.
[004:40:52;382] THOUGH MANY HERE HAVE BUSINESSES
[004:40:53;449] IN HIS DISTRICT, HE DOEST
[004:40:54;551] PRETEND TO GO ALONG WITH THEIR
[004:40:55;652] VIEWS, NOR WITH THOSE OF
[004:40:56;953] RENEGADE BLACK CAUCUS MEMBER
[004:40:58;689] GARY FRANKS, A REPUBLICAN WHO
[004:41:02;092] REDISTRICTING THAT GOT WATT
[004:41:03;794] ELECTED.
[004:41:07;964] >> TO TILT THE SCALE IN ANY
[004:41:08;699] DIRECTION WOULD BE WRONG.
[004:41:10;533] WE SHOULD LOOK FOR A FAIR
[004:41:11;768] SYSTEM AND NOT ONE THAT WOULD
[004:41:12;969] FAVOR WHITES, NOT ONE THAT WOULD
[004:41:14;137] FAVOR BLACKS OR BROWNS.
[004:41:19;209] >> GARY FRANKS SAYS THINGS LIKE
[004:41:20;110] THIS MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE
[004:41:20;911] A SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN.
[004:41:22;645] >> I THINK IF YOU ASK THE BLACK
[004:41:23;780] CITIZENS OF NORTH CAROLINA, IT
[004:41:24;781] IS THE ABSENCE OF REPRESENTATION
[004:41:25;816] IN CONGRESS THAT MAKES THEM FEEL
[004:41:27;184] LIKE SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS,
[004:41:28;484] NOT THE PHYSICAL APPEARANCE OF
[004:41:29;519] A DISTRICT ON A MAP.
[004:41:34;991] LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF HER
[004:41:36;093] NOMINATION TO A TOP CIVIL RIGHTS
[004:41:37;493] JOB, THINKS ENDING CONSIDERATION
[004:41:39;062] OF RACE COULD SEND SCORES OF
[004:41:40;597] BLACK OFFICIALS PACKING.
[004:41:44;500] >> I'M THE MESSENGER BEARING
[004:41:45;668] THIS WOULD FINISH PAVON.
[004:43:06;315] YOU KNOW
[004:43:06;315] WHERE HE IS?
[004:43:08;317] NOT YET.
[004:43:09;718] BUT NO HARM
[004:43:09;718] CAN BEFALL LUIS
[004:43:09;718] BEFORE 2:30 TOMORROW.
[004:43:13;221] DO YOU KNOW
[004:43:13;221] FROM WHERE
[004:43:13;221] HE WAS ABDUCTED?
[004:43:16;425] NO. HE WAS
[004:43:16;425] ON A STAKEOUT,
[004:43:16;425] ON THE SOUTH SIDE.
[004:43:20;128] MIGHT I SEE THE LAST
[004:43:20;128] CLOTHES HE WORE?
[004:43:23;665] CERTAINLY.
[004:43:25;300] [TELEVISION]
[004:43:25;300] WHAT DID THE BIG BAD WOLF
[004:43:25;300] LIKE TO EAT?
[004:43:29;270] YOU KNOW?
[004:43:30;972] HE USED TO EAT
[004:43:30;972] LITTLE GIRLS.
[004:43:33;809] HE USED TO GO,
[004:43:33;809] "RRR-RRR-RRR!"
[004:43:38;714] YOU ARE
[004:43:38;714] AN EXCELLENT LAUNDRESS.
[004:43:40;716] I FIND NO CLUES REGARDING
[004:43:40;716] WHERE HE WAS "STAKED OUT."
[004:43:44;720] WHY NOT
[004:43:44;720] ASK THE DEPARTMENT,
[004:43:46;921] OR BERNIE CIVITA?
[004:43:48;423] THEY ALTERNATED
[004:43:48;423] ON THE STAKEOUT.
[004:43:50;291] HE'S LUIS'
[004:43:50;291] PARTNER SOMETIMES,
[004:43:52;026] ONE OF
[004:43:52;026] HIS CLOSEST FRIENDS.
[004:43:53;928] CLOSEST FRIENDS?
[004:43:55;864] [HOLMES]
[004:43:55;864] LIEUTENANT CIVITA?
[004:43:55;864] HELLO?
[004:43:57;866] I'M NOT HAPPY.
[004:44:01;636] ofó?AwCx%Ñç;
[004:44:01;636] ONE...
[004:44:02;971] I THOUGHT YOU SAID
[004:44:02;971] ON THREE.
[004:44:05;474] I WAS AFRAID
[004:44:05;474] YOU'D FLINCH.
[004:44:07;409] THANKS FOR
[004:44:07;409] THE CONFIDENCE...
[004:44:09;344] AND FOR SAVING ME.
[004:44:11;079] YOU'RE WELCOME.
[004:44:12;581] YOU'RE ACTUALLY
[004:44:12;581] QUITE WORTH SAVING.
[004:44:14;483] REALLY?
[004:44:15;484] YES.
[004:44:16;485] AND YOUR PERFUME
[004:44:16;485] SUITS YOU.
[004:44:18;453] WHY?
[004:44:19;454] ROSES WITH
[004:44:19;454] A BREATH OF CITRUS,
[004:44:21;890] LIKE
[004:44:21;890] YOUR PERSONALITY.
[004:44:23;392] IS THAT
[004:44:23;392] A COMPLIMENT?
[004:44:25;126] IT COULD BE
[004:44:25;126] TAKEN AS SUCH,
[004:44:27;562] I SUPPOSE.
[004:44:28;996] WINSLOW?
[004:44:29;997] YES?
[004:44:30;998] WOULD YOU
[004:44:30;998] CONSIDER...
[004:44:32;500] WHAT?
[004:44:33;701] GETTING ON
[004:44:33;701] WITH OUR CASE?
[004:44:39;473] CHECK
[004:44:39;473] HIS TROUSER TURNUPS.
