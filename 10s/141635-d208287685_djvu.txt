provided  and  of  the  agreements  of  Lessee  herein  contained  hereby,  grants,  leases  and  lets  exclusively  unto  Lessee  for  the  purpose  of  investigating,  exploring, 
prospecting,  drilling  and  mining  for  and  producing  oil  and  gas,  the  following  described  land  in  Tarrant  County,  Texas,  (herein  referred  to  as  the  "Lease  Premises"  or  the 
"Land'")  to-wit 


See  attached  Exhibit  "AM  for  Land  Description 


This  Lease  also  covers  and  includes  all  strips  and  gores,  streets,  easements,  highways  and  alleyways,  and  other  land  and  interest  in  land  owned  or 
claimed  by  Lessor  adjacent  or  contiguous  to  the  Land,  whether  the  same  be  in  said  survey  or  surveys  or  in  adjacent  surveys.  Lessor  agrees  to  execute  at  Lessee's 
request  any  additional  or  supplemental  instruments  reasonably  necessary  for  a  more  complete  or  accurate  description  of  the  Ixase  Premises.  Furthermore,  Lessor 
authorizes  Lessee  to  complete  the  description  of  the  Lease  Premises  by  inserting,  as  appropriate,  the  applicable  Survey,  Abstract,  City  and  Plat  information  in  the 
description  set  forth  in  Exhibit  "A"  attached  hereto.  In  the  event  Lessor  owns  any  additional  acreage  than  that  for  which  bonus  was  originally  paid,  Lessee  shall  pay 
additional  bonus  at  a  rate  per  acre  not  less  than  the  rate  per  acre  on  which  bonus  was  originally  paid  when  this  Lease  was  acquired.  For  the  purpose  of  determining  the 
amount  of  any  shut-in  royalties  hereunder,  the  number  of  gross  acres  specified  on  Exhibit  "A"  shall  be  deemed  correct,  whether  actually  more  or  less. 


For  purposes  of  this  Lease,  "oil  and  gas"  means  oil,  gas  and  other  liquid  and  gaseous  hydrocarbons  and  their  constituent  elements  produced 
through  a  well  bore.  "Oil"  includes  all  condensate,  distillate  and  other  liquid  and  gaseous  hydrocarbons  produced  through  a  well  bore.  "Gas"  includes  helium,  carbon 
dioxide  and  other  commercial  gases,  as  well  as  hydrocarbon  gases.  Expressly  excluded  from  this  Lease  are  lignite,  coal,  sulfur  and  other  like  minerals. 


2.  Without  reference  to  the  commencement,  prosecution  or  cessation  at  any  time  of  drilling  or  other  development  operations,  and/or  to  the  discovery, 

development  or  cessation  at  any  time  of  production  of  oil,  gas  or  other  minerals,  and  without  further  payments  than  the  royalties  herein  provided,  and  notwithstanding 
anything  else  herein  contained  to  the  contrary,  this  Lease  shall  be  for  a  term  of  Three  (3)  years  from  the  date  hereof  (called  "Primary  Term")  and  as  long  thereafter  as 
oil,  gas  or  other  substance  covered  hereby  is  produced  in  paying  quantities  from  said  Land  or  land  pooled  therewith  hereunder,  or  as  long  as  this  Lease  is  continued  in 
effect,  as  otherwise  provided  herein. 


3.  The  royalties  to  be  paid  by  Lessee  are:  (a)  on  oil,  22.50%  of  that  produced  and  saved  from  said  Land ,  the  same  to  be  delivered  at  the  wells  or  to  the  credit 
of  Lessor  into  the  pipeline  to  which  the  wells  may  be  connected;  provided  that  Lessee  may  from  time  to  time  purchase  any  royalty  oil  in  its  possession,  paying  the 
market  price  therefore  prevailing  for  the  field  where  produced  on  the  date  of  purchase,  and  Lessee  may  sell  any  royalty  oil  in  its  possession  and  pay  Lessor  the  price 
received  by  Lessee  for  such  oil  computed  at  the  well;  and  (b)  on  gas,  including  casinghead  gas  or  other  gaseous  substance,  produced  from  die  Land  and  sold  or  used  off 
the  Lease  Premises  or  for  the  extraction  of  gasoline  or  other  product  therefrom,  the  market  value  at  the  well  of  22,50%  of  the  gas  so  sold  or  used,  provided  that  on  gas 
sold  by  Lessee  the  market  value  shall  not  exceed  the  amount  received  by  Lessee  for  such  gas  computed  at  the  mouth  of  the  well,  and  on  gas  sold  at  the  well  the  royalty 
shall  be  22.50%  of  the  amount  realized  by  Lessee  from  such  sale.  If  the  price  of  any  mineral  or  substance  upon  which  royalty  is  payable  hereunder  is  regulated  by  any 
governmental  agency,  the  market  value  or  market  price  of  such  mineral  or  substance  for  the  purpose  of  computing  royalty  hereunder  shall  not  be  in  excess  of  the  price 
which  Lessee  may  receive  and  retain.  Lessee  shall  have  free  from  royalty  or  other  payment  the  use  of  water,  other  than  water  from  Lessor's  wells  or  tanks,  and  of  oil 
and  gas  produced  from  the  Lease  Premises  in  all  operations  which  Lessee  may  conduct  hereunder,  including  water  injection  and  secondary  recovery  operations,  and  the 
royalty  on  oil  and  gas  shall  be  computed  after  deducting  any  so  used.  If  Lessee  drills  a  well  on  said  Land  or  on  land  pooled  therewith,  which  well  is  capable  of 
producing  oil  or  gas  but  such  well  is  not  being  produced  and  this  Lease  is  not  being  maintained  otherwise  as  provided  herein,  this  Lease  shall  not  terminate,  whether  it 
be  during  or  after  the  Primary  Term,  (unless  released  by  Lessee)  and  it  shall  nevertheless  be  considered  that  oil  and  gas  is  being  produced  from  the  Lease  Premises 
covered  by  this  Lease  when  Lessee  shall  pay  or  tender  (or  make  a  bona  fide  attempt  to  pay  or  tender!  as  shutjja  royalty  to  the  parties  who  at  the  time  of  such  payment  j

not  otherwise  maintained,  or  this  Lease  is  not  released  by  Lessee  as  to  the  land  on  which  or  the  horizon,  zone  or  formation  in  which  the  well  is  completed.  The  first 
payment  of  such  sum  shall  be  made  on  or  before  the  first  day  of  each  calendar  month  after  expiration  of  ninety  (90)  days  from  the  date  the  lease  is  not  otherwise 
maintained  for  all  accruals  to  such  date,  and  thereafter  on  or  before  the  first  day  of  each  third  calendar  month  for  all  accruals  to  each  such  date  to  Lessor's  designated

above  or  to  the  last  known  address  provided  in  writing  to  Lessee  by  Lessor  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary,  Lessee  may  from  time  to  time  withhold  and 
accumulate  such  payments  payable  to  Lessor  until  the  first  of  the  calendar  month  following  the  accumulation  of  Twenty-Five  and  no/100  Dollars  ($25.00)  when 
payment  shall  be  made  as  above  provided.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  herein,  it  is  expressly  understood  and  agreed  that  after  the  expiration  of  the 
primary  term,  Lessee  shall  not  have  the  right  to  continue  this  Lease  in  force  by  payment  of  shut-in  royalty  for  more  than  a  single  period  of  up  to  two  (2)  consecutive  "» 
years.  ft

4.  The  cash  down  payment  is  consideration  for  this  Lease  according  to  its  terms  and  shall  not  be  allocated  as  rental  for  a  period.  Lessee  may  at  any  time,  and  £^ 
from  time  to  time,  execute  and  deliver  to  Lessor,  or  to  the  depository  bank,  or  file  for  record  a  release  or  releases  of  mis  Lease  as  to  any  part  or  all  of  said  Land  or  of  ^ 
any  mineral  or  subsurface  interval  or  any  depths  thereunder  and  thereby  be  relieved  of  all  obligations  as  to  the  released  land,  mineral,  horizon,  zone  or  formation.  If  this  o* 
Lease  is  released  as  to  all  minerals,  horizons,  zones  and  formations  under  a  portion  of  the  Lease  Premises,  the  shut-in  royalty  and  other  payments  computed  in  ? 
accordance  therewith  shall  thereupon  be  reduced  in  the  proportion  that  the  acreage  released  bears  to  the  acreage  which  was  covered  by  this  Lease  immediately  prior  to 
such  release. 

5.  Lessee,  at  its  option,  is  hereby  given  the  right  and  power  during  or  after  the  Primary  Term  while  this  Lease  is  in  effect  to  pool  or  combine  the  Lease  Premises 
as  to  oil,  gas  and  other  minerals,  or  any  of  them,  with  any  other  land  covered  by  this  Lease,  and/or  any  other  land,  lease  or  leases  in  the  immediate  vicinity  thereof, 
when  in  Lessee's  judgment  it  is  necessary  or  advisable  to  do  so  in  order  properly  to  explore,  or  to  develop  and  operate  the  Lease  Premises  in  compliance  with  the 
spacing  rules  of  the  Railroad  Commission  of  Texas,  or  other  lawful  authority,  or  when  to  do  so  would,  in  the  judgment  of  Lessee,  promote  the  conservation  of  oil,  gas 
or  other  mineral  in  and  under  and  that  may  be  produced  from  the  Lease  Premises;  provided,  however,  that  the  entire  Lease  Premises  covered  by  this  Lease  shall  be 
included  in  any  unit  created  pursuant  to  the  pooling  authority  granted  herein.  Units  pooled  for  oil  shall  not  substantially  exceed  in  area  40  acres  each  plus  a  tolerance  of 
10%  thereof;  and  units  pooled  for  gas  hereunder  shall  not  substantially  exceed  in  area  160  acres  each  plus  a  tolerance  of  10%  thereof,  provided  that  should 
governmental  authority  having  jurisdiction  prescribe  or  permit  the  creation  of  units  larger  than  those  specified,  units  thereafter  created  may  conform  substantially  in  size 
with  those  prescribed  or  permitted  by  governmental  regulations.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  stated  herein,  a  unit  for  a  horizontal  well  may  include  (i)  the 
amount  of  acreage  allowed  for  obtaining  a  permit  to  drill  a  well  under  the  spacing  and  density  provisions  in  the  applicable  field  or  statewide  rules  for  a  vertical 
wellbore,  plus  the  additional  acreage  listed  in  the  tables  in  the  Railroad  Commission  of  Texas  Rule  86  (density  greater  than  40  acres),  or  (ii)  the  amount  of  acreage 
allowed  for  obtaining  a  full  production  allowable  under  the  applicable  field  or  statewide  rules  for  a  vertical  wellbore,  plus  the  additional  acreage  listed  m  the  tables  in 
the  Railroad  Commission  of  Texas  Rule  86  (density  greater  than  40  acres).  Lessee  may  pool  or  combine  the  Lease  Premises  or  any  portion  thereof,  as  above  provided 
as  to  oil  in  any  one  or  more  strata  and  as  to  gas  in  any  one  or  more  strata.  Units  formed  by  pooling  as  to  any  stratum  or  strata  need  not  conform  in  size  or  area  with 
units  as  to  any  other  stratum  or  strata,  and  oil  units  need  not  conform  as  to  area  with  gas  units.  Pooling  in  one  or  more  instances  shall  not  exhaust  the  rights  of  Lessee  to 
pool  this  Lease  or  portions  thereof  into  other  units.  Lessee  shall  file  for  record  in  the  appropriate  records  of  the  county  in  which  the  Lease  Premises  is  situated  an

instrument  describing  and  designating  the  pooled  acreage  as  a  pooled  unit;  the  unit  shall  become  effective  as  provided  in  said  instruments,  or  if  said  instrument  makes 
no  such  provision,  it  shall  become  effective  upon  the  date  it  is  filed  for  record.  Each  unit  shall  be  effective  as  to  all  parties  hereto,  their  heirs,  successors  and  assigns, 
irrespective  of  whether  or  not  the  unit  is  likewise  effective  as  to  all  other  owners  of  surface,  mineral,  royalty  or  other  rights  in  land  included  in  such  unit.  Lessee  may  at 
its  election  exercise  its  pooling  option  as  to  oil,  gas  and  other  minerals  before  or  after  commencing  operations  for  or  completing  an  oil  or  gas  well  or  wells  or  mine  for 
other  mineral  on  me  Lease  Premises,  and  the  pooled  unit  may  include,  but  is  not  required  to  include,  land  or  leases  upon  which  a  well  or  mine  capable  of  producing  oil, 
gas  or  other  mineral  in  paying  quantities  has  theretofore  been  completed  or  upon  which  operations  for  drilling  of  a  well  or  mine  for  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  have 
theretofore  been  commenced.  Operations  for  drilling  on,  or  production  of  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  from  any  part  of  a  pooled  unit  which  includes  all  or  a  portion  of  the 
Lease  Premises,  regardless  of  whether  such  operations  for  drilling  were  commenced  or  such  production  was  secured  before  or  after  the  execution  of  this  Lease  or  the 
instrument  designating  the  pooled  unit,  shall  be  considered  as  operations  for  drilling  on  or  production  of  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  from  the  Lease  Premises  whether  or 
not  the  well  or  wells  or  mine  be  located  on  the  Lease  Premises,  and  the  entire  acreage  constituting  such  unit  or  units,  as  to  oil,  gas  or  other  minerals,  or  any  of  them,  as 
herein  provided,  shall  be  treated  for  all  purposes,  except  the  payment  of  royalties  on  production  from  the  pooled  unit,  as  if  the  same  were  included  in  this  Lease; 
provided  that  if  after  creation  of  a  pooled  unit,  a  well  or  mine  drilled  on  the  unit  area,  other  than  on  the  land  covered  hereby  and  included  in  the  unit,  which  well  is  not 
classified  as  the  type  of  well  for  which  the  unit  was  created  (oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  as  the  case  may  be),  such  well  or  mine  shall  be  considered  a  dry  hole  for  purposes 
of  applying  the  additional  drilling  and  reworking  provisions  of  Paragraph  6  hereof.  If  an  oil  well  on  an  oil  unit,  which  includes  all  or  a  portion  of  the  Lease  Premises,  is 
reclassified  as  a  gas  well,  or  if  a  gas  well  on  a  gas  unit,  which  includes  all  or  a  portion  of  the  Lease  Premises,  is  reclassified  as  an  oil  well,  the  date  of  such 
reclassification  shall  be  considered  as  the  date  of  cessation  of  production  for  purposes  of  applying  the  additional  drilling  and  reworking  provisions  of  Paragraph  6  hereof 
as  to  all  leases  any  part  of  which  are  included  in  the  unit  other  than  the  leased  premises  on  which  the  well  is  located.  For  the  purpose  of  computing  royalties  to  which 
owners  of  royalties  and  payments  out  of  production  and  each  of  them  shall  be  entitled  on  production  of  oil,  gas  or  other  minerals  from  each  pooled  unit,  there  shall  be 
allocated  to  the  Lease  Premises  and  included  in  said  unit  (or  to  each  separate  tract  within  the  unit  if  this  Lease  covers  separate  tracts  within  the  unit)  a  pro  rata  portion  of 
the  oil,  gas  or  other  minerals  produced  from  the  unit  after  deducting  that  used  for  operations  on  the  unit.  Such  allocation  shall  be  on  an  acreage  basis  -  that  is,  there 
shall  be  allocated  to  the  acreage  covered  by  this  Lease  and  included  in  the  pooled  unit  (or  to  each  separate  tract  within  the  unit  if  this  Lease  covers  separate  tracts  within 
the  unit)  that  pro  rata  portion  of  the  oil,  gas  or  other  minerals  produced  from  the  unit  which  the  number  of  surface  acres  covered  by  this  Lease  (or  in  each  separate  tract) 
and  included  irt  the  unit  bears  to  the  total  number  of  surface  acres  included  in  the  unit.  As  used  in  this  paragraph,  the  words,  -"separate  tract-"  mean  any  tract  with 
royalty  ownership  differing,  now  or  hereafter,  either  as  to  parties  or  amounts,  from  that  as  to  any  other  part  of  the  Lease  Premises.  Royalties  hereunder  shall  be 
computed  on  the  portion  of  such  production,  whether  it  be  oil,  gas  or  other  minerals,  so  allocated  to  the  Lease  Premises  and  included  in  the  unit  just  as  though  such 
production  were  from  such  land.  Production  from  an  oil  well  will  be  considered  as  production  from  the  lease  or  oil  pooled  unit  from  which  it  is  producing  and  not  as 
production  from  a  gas  pooled  unit  and  production  from  a  gas  well  will  be  considered  as  production  from  the  lease  or  gas  pooled  unit  from  which  it  is  producing  and  not 
from  an  oil  pooled  unit  Any  pooled  unit  designated  by  Lessee  in  accordance  with  the  terms  hereof  may  be  dissolved  by  Lessee  by  instrument  filed  for  record  in  the 
appropriate  records  of  the  county  in  which  the  Lease  Premises  is  situated  at  any  time  after  completion  of  a  dry  hole  or  cessation  of  production  on  said  unit. 
Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  herein,  it  is  expressly  provided  that  all  leases  acquired  by  Lessee  which  are  located  within  the  Thornbridge  development  (i.e., 
the  Thornbridge  subdivision  Phase  1,  H,  HI,  IV,  V,  East  and  South)  will  be  pooled  or  unitized  within  the  same  pool  or  unit  created  by  Lessee  and  each  such  lease  will 
receive  its  proportionate  part  of  the  unit  production  by  calculating  royalty  payments  as  described  above. 

6.  If  at  the  expiration  of  the  primary  Term,  oil,  gas,  or  other  mineral  is  not  being  produced  on  the  Lease  Premises,  or  from  land  pooled  therewith,  but  Lessee  is 
then  engaged  in  drilling  or  reworking  operations  thereon,  or  shall  have  completed  a  dry  hole  thereon  within  120  days  prior  to  the  end  of  the  Primary  Term,  this  Lease 
shall  remain  in  force  so  long  as  operations  on  said  well  or  for  drilling  or  reworking  of  any  additional  well  are  prosecuted  with  no  cessation  of  more  than  60  consecutive 
days,  and  if  they  result  in  the  production  of  oil,  gas,  or  other  mineral,  so  long  thereafter  as  oil,  gas,  or  other  mineral  is  produced  from  the  Lease  Premises,  or  from  land 
pooled  therewith.  If,  after  the  expiration  of  the  Primary  Term  of  this  Lease  and  after  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  is  produced  from  the  Lease  Premises,  or  from  land  pooled 
therewith,  the  production  thereof  should  cease  from  any  cause,  this  Lease  shall  not  terminate  if  Lessee  commences  operations  for  drilling  or  reworking  within  120  days 
after  the  cessation  of  such  production,  but  shall  remain  in  force  and  effect  so  long  as  Lessee  continues  drilling  or  reworking  operations  on  said  well  or  for  drilling  or 
reworking  of  any  additional  well  with  no  cessation  of  more  than  60  consecutive  days,  and  if  they  result  in  the  production  of  oil,  gas,  or  other  mineral,  so  long  thereafter 
as  oil,  gas,  or  other  mineral  is  produced  from  the  Lease  Premises,  or  from  land  pooled  therewith.  In  the  event  a  well  or  wells  producing  oil  or  gas  in  paying  quantities 
should  be  brought  in  on  adjacent  land  and  within  660'  feet  of  and  draining  the  Lease  Premises,  or  land  pooled  therewith,  Lessee  agrees  to  drill  such  offset  well  or  wells 
as  a  reasonably  prudent  operator  would  drill  under  the  same  or  similar  circumstances. 

7.  The  rights  of  either  party  hereunder  may  be  assigned  in  whole  or  in  part,  and  the  provisions  hereof  shall  extend  to  their  heirs,  successors  and  assigns:  but  no 
change  or  division  in  ownership  of  the  land  or  royalties,  however  accomplished,  shall  operate  to  enlarge  the  obligations  or  diminish  the  rights  of  Lessee,  including,  but 
not  limited  to,  the  location  and  drilling  of  wells  and  the  measurement  of  production;  and  no  change  or  division  in  such  ownership  shall  be  binding  on  Lessee  until  forty- 
five  (45)  days  after  Lessee  shall  have  been  furnished  by  registered  U.S.  mail  at  Lessee's  principal  place  of  business  with  a  certified  copy  of  recorded  instrument  or 
instruments  evidencing  same.  In  the  event  of  assignment  hereof  in  whole  or  in  part,  liability  for  breach  of  any  obligation  hereunder  shall  rest  exclusively  upon  the 
owner  of  this  Lease  or  of  a  portion  thereof  who  commits  such  breach.  If  six  or  more  parties  become  entitled  to  royalty  hereunder,  Lessee  may  withhold  payment  thereof 
unless  and  until  furnished  with  a  recordable  instrument  executed  by  all  such  parties  designating  an  agent  to  receive  payment  for  all. 

8.  In  the  event  Lessor  considers  that  operations  are  not  at  any  time  being  conducted  in  compliance  with  this  Lease,  Lessor  shall  notify  Lessee  in  writing  of  the 
facts  relied  upon  as  constituting  a  breach  hereof,  and  Lessee,  if  in  default,  shall  have  sixty  (60)  days  after  receipt  of  such  notice  in  which  to  commence  compliance  with 
the  obligations  imposed  by  virtue  of  this  Lease. 

9.  Lessor  makes  no  warranty  of  any  kind  with  respect  to  title  to  the  surface  or  mineral  estate  in  the  leased  premises  or  any  portion  of  or  interest  therein.  All 
warranties  that  might  arise  by  common  law  or  by  statute,  including  but  not  limited  to  Section  5.023  of  the  Texas  Property  Code  (or  its  successor),  are  excluded.  By 
acceptance  of  this  Lease,  Lessee  acknowledges  that  it  has  been  given  full  opportunity  to  investigate  and  has  conducted  sufficient  investigation  to  satisfy  itself  as  to  the 
title  to  the  leased  premises.  Lessee  assumes  all  risk  of  title  failures. 

10.  Should  Lessee  be  prevented  from  complying  with  any  express  or  implied  covenant  of  this  Lease,  from  conducting  drilling  or  reworking  operations  thereon 
or  on  land  pooled  therewith  or  from  producing  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  therefrom  or  from  land  pooled  therewith  by  reason  of  scarcity  or  of  inability  to  obtain  or  to  use 
equipment  or  material,  or  by  operation  of  force  majeure,  any  federal  or  state  law  or  any  order,  rule  or  regulation  of  governmental  authority,  then  while  so  prevented. 
Lessee's  obligation  to  comply  with  such  covenant  shall  be  suspended,  and  Lessee  shall  not  be  liable  in  damages  for  failure  to  comply  therewith;  and  this  Lease  shall  be 
extended  while  and  so  long  as  Lessee  is  prevented  by  any  such  cause  from  conducting  drilling  or  reworking  operations  on  or  from  producing  oil,  gas  or  other  minerals 
from  the  Lease  Premises  ot  land  pooled  therewith,  and  the  time  while  Lessee  is  so  prevented  shall  not  be  counted  against  Lessee,  anything  in  this  Lease  to  the  contrary

Furthermore,  Lessee  shall  not  drill  any  wells  or  conduct  any  operations  within  six  hundred  (600)  feet  of  the  Lease  Premises.  Lessee  shall  only  develop  the  Lease

restrict  I-essee's  exploration  of  or  production  from  the  Lease  Premises  by  means  of  wells  drilled  on  other  lands  but  entering  or  bottomed  on  the  Lease  Premises.  Any

horizontal  wells)  on  the  Lease  Premises  shall  be  regarded  as  if  the  wells  were  drilled  on  the  Lease  Premises.  Lessee  agrees  that  any  drilling  under  the  Lease  Premises 
shall  commence  at  and  continue  at  depths  below  five  hundred  feet  (5007)  from  the  surface  of  the  earth.  In  addition  to  Lessee's  other  rights  under  this  Lease,  Lessor 
hereby  grants  to  Lessee  a  subsurface  easement  to  drill  and  operate  directional  and/or  horizontal  wells  under  and  through  the  Lease  Premises  to  reach  lands  not  covered 
by  this  Lease  and  which  wells  have  bottom  hole  locations  (if  a  vertical  well)  or  horizontal  drainhole  locations  (if  a  horizontal  well)  on  lands  not  covered  by  this  Lease  or 
land  pooled  therewith.  Lessee  agrees  that  this  subsurface  easement  shall  commence  at  and  continue  at  all  depths  below  five  hundred  feet  (500')  from  the  surface  of  the 
earth. 

12.  Noise  levels  associated  with  Lessee's  operations  related  to  the  drilling,  completion  and  reworking  of  wells  shall  be  kept  to  a  reasonable  minimum,  taking 
into  consideration  reasonably  available  equipment  and  technology  in  the  oil  and  gas  industry,  the  level  and  nature  of  development  and  surface  use  elsewhere  in  the 
vicinity  of  Lessee's  drill  sites  and  the  fact  Lessee's  operations  are  being  conducted  in  or  near  an  urban  residential  area.  If  Lessee  utilizes  any  non-electric-powered 
equipment  in  its  operations.  Lessee  shall  take  reasonable  steps  to  muffle  the  sound  therefrom  by  installing  a  noise  suppression  muffler  or  like  equipment. 

13-  Lessee's  obligations  under  this  Lease,  whether  express  or  implied,  shall  be  subject  to  all  applicable  laws,  rules,  regulations  and  orders  of  any  governmental 

authority  having  jurisdiction,  including  environmental  regulations,  setback  requirements,  restrictions  on  the  drilling  and  production  of  wells,  and  the  price  of  oil,  gas 
and  other  substances  covered  hereby.  To  the  extent  any  such  laws,  rules,  regulations  or  orders  are  less  restrictive  than  the  terms  of  this  Lease,  this  Lease  shall  control.
