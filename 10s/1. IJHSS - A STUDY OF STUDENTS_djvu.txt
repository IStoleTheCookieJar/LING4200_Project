ABSTRACT 

Education  is  very  essential  for  the  development  and  betterment  of  any  country.  It  is  important  in  shaping  the  life 
of  human  being.  The  present  study  reveals  that  chemistry  is  a subject  which  plays  a key  role  in  progress  of  society.  It 
develops  the  ability  of  thinking,  reasoning  and  curiosity  in  the  student’s  mind.  It  is  helpful  in  the  revision  of  curriculum  and 
improvement  of  teaching  strategies.  The  students  with  low  and  medium  socio-economic  class  must  be  provided  additional 
facilities  for  imparting  them  such  kind  of  knowledge  which  would  help  in  increasing  their  achievement  and  progress.

INTRODUCTION 

In  the  modern  world,  education  plays  a vital  role  in  the  progress  of  society.  Nature  is  ever-changing  and  the 
human  behavior  can  be  changed  only  through  education.  Education  is  a process  of  all  round  development  of  human  beings. 
Education  is  part  of  a larger  radical  reconstruction  of  the  priorities  of  the  society.  In  education,  each  subject  has  special 
importance  in  shaping  the  life  of  human  being.  But  some  subjects  are  given  special  importance  to  the  curriculum  on  the 
basis  of  its  usefulness  and  impact.  The  subject  which  is  important  from  social,  cultural  and  economic  point  of  view  is  given 
special  preference  in  the  curriculum.  Qablan,  Al-Ruz,  Khasaweh,  and  Al-Omari  (2009)  speak  of  the  need  during  teacher 
education  to  fight  the  indoctrination  of  teaching  practices. 

The  teachers'  awareness  of  the  goals  and  active  participation  is  crucial  to  the  entire  process  of  curricular 
integration  (Mellado,  Ruiz,  Bermejo,  & Jimenez,  2006).  Borg  and  Gall  (2003)  mentioned  that  student  testing  aims  to 
obtain  a qualitative  evaluation  of  the  new  teaching  product  being  developed.  Teacher  education  must  be  accordant  with  an 
STS  (science,  technology,  and  society)  model  both  pre-  and  in-service  (Yeti  sir  & Kaptan,  2008). 

As  educational  system  becomes  universal,  more  and  more  people  are  exposed  to  abstract  learning  (of  subjects  like 
Maths,  Science,  Literature  etc),  rather  than  to  the  practical  transmission  of  specific  skills.  Science  is  increasingly  being 
recognized  as  a subject  of  life-long  utility  to  students.  In  this  world  of  21st  century  it  is  the  necessity  to  have  more  and 
more  better  equipped  science  literate  populace  for  better  economic  progress  and  social  welfare.  Chemistry  is  also  a branch 
of  science  which  is  given  a special  importance  in  modern  curriculum.  Chemistry  is  mainly  related  to  study  of  atoms, 
molecules,  chemical  reactions,  energy,  etc.  the  chemical  changes  and  reactions  taking  place  in  the  universe  are  studied 
under  the  subject  chemistry.  Education  empowers  the  individuals  with  necessary  skills  and  competence  for  achieving 
personal  and  social  goals,  which  in  turn  contribute  to  the  development  of  nation.

Problem  Statement 

The  ability  of  thinking  and  understanding  develops  in  the  students  when  they  are  in  high  school.  Hence  at  this 
stage,  due  to  lack  of  suitable  tests,  there  needs  an  achievement  test  for  improvement  in  teaching  strategies,  change  in 
curriculum,  etc.  Hence  to  overcome  these  defects,  the  present  research  has  been  conducted  in  which  objective  type 
questions  have  been  used  for  comparative  study  of  boys  and  girls  and  their  socio-economic  status  in  chemistry  at  high 
school  level. 

Objectives  of  Research 

This  research  is  conducted  to  satisfy  the  following  objectives: 

• To  construct  achievement  test  related  to  chemistry. 

• To  measure  the  achievement  of  boys  of  high  school  level. 

• To  measure  the  achievement  of  girls  of  high  school  level. 

• To  investigate  the  socio-economic  level  of  the  students. 

Hypothesis  of  Study 

In  the  present  study,  “A  Study  of  Students  Achievement  in  Relation  to  their  Sex  and  Socio-economic  Status  in 
Chemistry  at  High  School  Level.”,  I have  started  the  work  by  considering  the  following  hypothesis: 

• In  chemistry  subject  of  high  school,  there  is  no  significant  difference  between  the  obtained  marks  and  mean  or  it 
means, 

Ho  = Mi=M2=0 

Where  Mj  = mean  of  marks  obtained  by  boys 
And,  Mi  = mean  of  marks  obtained  by  girls. 

• There  is  no  significant  difference  in  the  frequency  of  probable  distribution  on  the  basis  of  free  distribution  and 
observed  distribution  of  achievement  and  socio-economic  status  of  high  school  students. 

RESEARCH  METHODOLOGY 

For  this  study,  total  200  students  were  selected  from  following  4 schools,  (50  students  from  each  school)  by 
random  method  : 

• Maharaja  Agrasen  Intermediate  College,  Deoria  (50  Boys) 

• Government  Intermediate  College,  Deoria  (50  Boys) 

• Kasturba  Gandhi  Government  Intermediate  College,  Deoria  (50  Girls) 

• Indira  Gandhi  Intermediate  College,  Deoria  (50  Girls) 

A questionnaire  of  Chemistry  was  developed  from  the  text  book  of  chemistry  of  high  school  level  to  test  the 
knowledge  of  the  subject  and  some  general  questions  were  prepared  to  study  the  socio-economic  status  of  the  students.  The 
students  were  asked  to  give  free  and  frank  answers  without  any  hestitation.  The  gathered  data  were  analysed  and

The  mean  and  standard  deviation  of  scores  of  students  achievement  are  summarized  in  table  4.  The  mean  of 
scores  of  boys  is  32.7  and  standard  deviation  is  7 which  reveals  that  the  individual  difference  is  of  nominal  level.  After  this 
test  it  was  observed  that  the  scores  of  boys  are  in  the  range  of  28-38.  The  students  who  have  good  knowledge  have  given 
the  right  answer  to  the  questions  and  it  is  necessary  to  develop  more  interest  in  chemistry  for  some  students  who  have 
obtained  less  marks.  The  mean  of  scores  of  girls  is  32.38  and  standard  deviation  is  6.98  which  reveals  that  the  individual 
difference  is  of  nominal  level. 

The  mean  and  standard  deviation  of  scores  of  students  on  the  basis  of  socio-ecoomic  level  are  summarized  in 
table  5.  The  mean  values  of  scores  of  boys  of  high,  medium  and  low  socio-economic  level  are  43.1,  33.98,  and  25.79  and 
their  standard  deviation  is  2.88,  1.92,  and  3.96  respectively.  The  mean  values  of  scores  of  girls  of  high,  medium  and  low 
socio-economic  level  are  42.86,  32.88,  and  24.97  and  their  standard  deviation  is  2.48,  2.04,  and  3.73  respectively.  It  means 
that  achievement  and  socio-economic  level  of  students  are  inter-related.  The  students  with  high  socio-economic  level  have 
high  achievement  score  and  students  of  low  socio-economic  level  have  less  achievement  score. 

A 3x3  contingency  table  was  prepared  on  the  basis  of  high,  medium  and  low  achievement  and  their  socio- 
economic level  and  chi  square  test  was  done.  The  value  obtained  was  2.97  which  is  less  at  0.05  and  0.01  level  of 
significance  of  the  table  value  at  4 degrees  of  freedom.  This  shows  that  there  is  no  significant  difference  in  independent 
and  calculated  frequency  distribution.  This  accepts  the  null  hypothesis. 

CONCLUSIONS 

Within  the  limitations  of  the  study  and  procedures,  following  conclusions  were  drawn  : 

• The  study  reveals  that  the  results  obtained  from  administration  of  the  test  is  highly  reliable. 

• From  the  validity  of  the  test,  its  format,  study  material  of  blueprint  and  results,  it  is  clear  that  the  test  is  valid. 

• Critical  ratio  reveals  that  there  is  significant  difference  in  the  mean  scores  of  obtained  marks  of  boys  and  girls. 

• The  scores  of  socio-economic  status  are  oriented  toward  the  normal  curve. 

• Chi-square  test  revels  that  students  achievement  and  their  socio-economic  status  are  independent. 

Hence,  a spirit  of  healthy  competition  can  be  encouraged  among  the  students  where  the  students  with  good 
achievement  can  be  an  inspiration.  This  study  is  helpful  in  the  revision  of  curriculum  and  teaching  strategies.  It  can  make 
the  students  aware  of  chemistry  which  can  play  a key  role  in  providing  education  for  the  progress  of  society.  From  the 
socio-economic  point  of  view,  it  is  very  helpful  in  selection  of  students  belonging  to  low  class  and  medium  class  and 
providing  them  additional  educational  facility  in  the  school.  This  research  is  very  helpful  in  selection  of  brilliant  students  in 
chemistry  for  their  admission  in  higher  classes.
