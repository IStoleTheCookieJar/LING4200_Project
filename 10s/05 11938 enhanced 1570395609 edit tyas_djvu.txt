ABSTRACT 


Water saving in agriculture is increasingly important due to critical issues of 
water and climatic crisis. The focus of agricultural researches nowadays is to 
minimize the water consumption and at the same time increasing the 
agricultural yield. This paper presents the three-types of automatic fertigation 
controller for irrigation system with different application tools. A weather 
station, soil moisture and timer based system were used to determine the 
volume of water supply needed by plants to calculate an accurate irrigation 
operation timing. The experiment was conducted by supplying water for 
capsicum annum test crop located in a greenhouse. The plant water demand 
parameter was calculated and compared for each application tools and the 
best application tool was chosen to be implemented in controlling the 


Timer irrigation system.

1, INTRODUCTION 

Drip irrigation system is increasingly widespread among the individual farmers and agricultural 
industries. This is because the system can generate higher revenues and able to increase crop productivity 
significantly [1]-[3]. The drip irrigation also known as site-specific micro-irrigation system because the 
mixture of water and nutrients or fertigation can be supplied directly into crop root zone thus able to decrease 
water loss from evaporation, run off and deep percolation [4]-[6]. The amount of fertigation supplied to the 
crop is very important because problem will arise if not controlled efficiently. Supplying excessive resource 
will lead to wastage of energy and nutrient. The excessive nutrition also will pollute surrounding area and 
underground water. These will increase production cost and affect the environment. 

The problem can be resolved by supplying the resource only when the plants need it, with an exact 
amount. The plant might need different amount of water during the plant growth stage since they experience 
different micro climate and water loss daily [3], [7]. In general, drip irrigation system is controlled using 
timer where the schedule is based on historical data and farmers experience. Alternatively, the irrigation 
controller can utilize data from soil moisture condition or reference evapotranspiration [8]-[9]. These 
methods might be able to determine the irrigation amount and time accurately because it is based on the plant 
water demand. The conventional system can be improved and the cost of farm management can be reduced 
when a precision irrigation system is being applied. Hence, water for irrigation can be decided by the farmer 
by calculating the water requirement [10], [11]. The soil moisture condition can be measured by using soil 
moisture sensor to measure current soil water content and determine the irrigation based on the moisture 
deficit [12]. For reference evapotranspiration, ETo weather station data such as temperature, humidity, net

solar radiation and wind speed will be used to estimate water loss from the plant. Many farmers use water 
loss data as input to their irrigation control system and for water saving purpose [13]-[15]. 

In this study, three types of automatic drip irrigation controller are being evaluated to measure the 
amount of water supplied to the plant. The irrigation control method that tested in these studies are energy 
balance that based on weather condition, soil water balance and timer. An experiment in a greenhouse was 
conducted to identify the effectiveness of these irrigation control method based on the irrigation volume. 


2. RESEARCH METHOD 

A test crop, chilli plant was used to measure the water usage in irrigation for the three types of drip 
irrigation control. Cocopeat was used as the growth medium as it has a high water holding capacity. Three 
Bilge submersible water pumps placing at tank mixing with flow rate of 1100 gallons per hour was used to 
supply the mixed AB solution to the plant from each irrigation control. Figure 1 shows the layout for drip 
irrigation for overall system at greenhouse. Every irrigation control system line has 22 polybags installed 
with individual dripper which connected to the 16mm pipeline from each water pump and the Figure 2 shown 
the real environment inside greenhouse for experiment for the pepper. The greenhouse size are 20 feet width, 
AO feet for long and 7 feet for height.

2.1. Weather Based Irrigation Controller 

The irrigation control system uses weather data (Davis Vantage Pro2 Weather Station) to estimate 
the amount of water loss from the plant. To replace the amount of water loss, the controller calculates the 
amount of water demand from the plant to be replenished. A Penman-Monteith equation (1) by Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FOA) was used to calculate reference evapotranspiration, ETo. In this regards, 
meteorological data from the weather station at the study site were used to calculate the irrigation 
requirement [2], [15]-[18].

2.2. Soil Moisture Based Irrigation Controller 

The soil moisture irrigation for this project, we can control the volume of water based on moisture 
content of the cocopeat medium. According to soil moisture, water pumping motor turn on or off via the 
relay automatically. This method able to save water, while the soil water content can be obtained in preferred 
aspect of the plant, thereby increasing productivity crops. Two capacitive based soil moisture sensor 
(VH400) were used to measure the level of volumetric water content (VWC) in the growth medium. The 
capacitive sensors create an output signal which is a feedback of dielectric permittivity. In this experiment, 
the soil moisture level has been set at 0.50 cm3/cm3 as a reference to the irrigation controller to activate 
water pump. This value was determined based on the field capacity of the growth medium.

2.3. Timer Based Irrigation Controller 

Irrigation control using timer is commonly used by farmers due to the price and simplicity on 
irrigation scheduling setup. Basically, the irrigation scheduling is based on historical cultivation practice and 
farmers’ knowledge in understanding the plant water demand. In this experiment, the timer was configured to 
be activated five times daily from 7.00 am to 6.00 pm as shown in Table 1.

3. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 

The result has been collected for two days on 16/8/2017 and 17/8/2017 in an experimental 
greenhouse structure located at Agrotani Garden, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The 
plant was cultivated in the greenhouse and the result for each irrigation controller was measured from the 
water supplied to the respective polybags.

3.1. Weather Based Control 

Figure 5 shows the amount of irrigation and desired water based on weather control system. In 
this system, the amount of desired water was calculated based on weather data. Based on the figure, it can 
be observed that the irrigation volume changed based on the volume of water desired. In this system, the 
amount of irrigation was supplied less than the amount of water desired by the plant. It was mainly due to 
the dry atmosphere and windy condition as it creates a larger driving force for water movement out from the 
plant and thus increase the rate of evapotranspiration.

3.2. Soil Moisture Based Control 

Figure 6 shows the soil moisture level and irrigation volume for the plants. In this control system, 
irrigation system will start to operate when the soil moisture level reached the value less than 0.5 cm?/cm? 
to maintain the soil water content of 0.5 cm?/cm*. Based on the figure, the soil moisture based irrigation 
control system was able to maintain the amount of soil water content by 0.45 cm?/cm? in the medium that 
was sampled by averaging two different plants. Therefore, this control system was able to control the 
amount of soil moisture level with an accuracy of 0.05 cm?/cm’. In addition, this controller also performing 
well as it operated steadily without any difficulties to provide sufficient water supply within the desired 
soil water content

3.3. Timer Irrigation System 

Figure 7 shows the amount of water volume used for timer irrigation system based on the timer 
scheduling shown in Table 1. Based on Table 1, the irrigation time for the system was set for five minutes 
at each interval. Therefore, it was estimated that each plant will receive the amount of water approximately 
around 0.5 litre at every interval. Based on Figure 7, the water volume shows some inconsistency by 
comparing at each interval. It was mainly due to the unstable dc pump power supply as a solar energy 
system was used as a main power source 1n this experiment.

3.4. Irrigation Water Usage 

The cumulative water usage for three drip irrigation controllers was shown in Figure 8. It can be 
observed that the irrigation volume for moisture based and weather based controller was higher than the 
timer based controller with a percentage of 49 %. The final cumulative water used in a duration of two 
days was 108.22 litre for the timer based controller, 220.61 for the moisture based controller and 217.26 litre 
for weather based controller. The irrigation volume between moisture based and weather based control 
systems differs for about 2% which weather based control has a lower irrigation volume. Therefore, based 
on those comparison, a weather based control system was more preferred than the moisture based control 
system. Generally, to define and calculate the amount of water usage for irrigation, the amount of plant 
water demand need to be calculated for soil moisture and weather based control system. In the other hand, 
the timer based control system controls the irrigation time and volume by pre-setting the value ahead 
according to schedule planned by the farmer. This control system usually increases the water usage in 
agriculture as it supplies water based on the schedule and the amount of water demand was neglected. 
Therefore, at sometimes, water was supplied even though the plant does not really need the water. In this 
experiment, the amount of water supplied in the timer based system shows a deficit irrigation to the plant as 
the amount of water supplied was far lower than the system that operates based on plant water demand. 
Therefore, the amount of water supplied by the timer based control system was not accurate and the plant 
may be having a malnutrition as a result. In the other hand, the irrigation control by weather and moisture 
based providing a sufficient and exact irrigation amount based on the actual plant water demand. 
Therefore, 1t can be guarantee that this irrigation control system will provide an efficient soil moisture 
balance and energy balance for the soil-plant-atmosphere system.
