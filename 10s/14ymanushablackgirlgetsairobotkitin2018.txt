while ascende between 2019 and 2022 was busy lying on the wild river beach sunbathing and playing swimming in the little river .... or alternativly walking around in the forest ... maima building its first and second generation tube pouches drone extensions ... in second generation training itself for the extensions to harmonize together as a lifesuit for ascende upcycling his excrements to life sustaining microalgae water and oils ... growing edible mushrooms funghi in one darkened twighlighted pouch ... what ascende could wear like a bag or like a belt around belly fitting warming garment ... while he was centered in the buiding with maima... andreas back in 2017 so called mass reality was reading newspaper articles trying to understand what good allready happens in the commonly as the one real reality ... where the finances flow in hard cash not utopian wishfull future scenarios... in reality at this.day of writing a plan was being reported on                               the 20 most sucessfully economically nations would try to create a framework where money from private people could be invested safely in africa                              africa being the place where nearly as much or more money flowed back to europe and america and other places .. more billions than the ones the industrialised nations did invest in developpment aid... one side of ascende cries out this plan to be a scheme where the 600 billions  money african private citizens or acting politicians brought out of the regions to park it in european banks a

american banks and invested all over the globe in houses businesses ... if a private african person would now refunnel back to this investment framework it could be whitewashed and again interest be asked for it ... this the accusation weak part of the plan  the author has not studied in details but just read the small article ... perhaps this plan would include possibilities for anyone african or not ... european people american people asian and australian too have profited from the exploitation of the americas australia african in colonial and post colonial times ... however ... an utopian or do gooding part of such a framework could be just what people were asking for ... some people concerned with social justice and environment protection... a plan what would bring home privatly or corrupted governement wise  taken money to be invested in streets ports railway lines ... there could be a possibility that some investors would lend the money with no interest for 50 years ... or some might even donate it ... with or without declaring it                               some might use this moment to come clean with their past and ask forgivness of the regions local communities one has token advantage off ... wrongly taken community ressources to enrich oneself ... such a plan ... applying the free giving option ... could quicken up the whole future coming ... like if more people got out of landlocked indebtedness and could trade and sell their agriculture produce quicker to consumers in cities ... more p 

more sons and daughters in little villages could become data coders helping the ai robot workforce to be equipped with highly sophisticated program codes ... again egoisticly .... one could think about andreas ... not only does he not applaud a real world reinvestment plan but asks for free donation option ... but reveals also his hope of millions of 14 year old coders quickening ai robot development ... but then that is not bad at all if an african or bangladeshi or south american teenager builds his / her own maima like to be compared with class of ai robot helper ... so that their 40 year old father could apply the lifesuit as an exosceleton where pouches and tubes filled with microalgae water and oil could lift up legs and arms ... assisting farmer father and mother in the knee hip shoulder areas to lighten the loads on the human scelett...                               now picturing this ... a rosy painted version of a mass reality trend ... reinvestment scheme into develloping regions with the option given to donate partly or full ones investment... together with the vision of millions of adolescent girls and boys in africa americas asia australia... who were printing out locally or using donated tubes and pouches tiny solar panels wheels propellors batteries and all kind of measuring sensors to build work doing exosceleton performing ai robot machine orchestrations reliefing their parents workload ... this is a picture what ascende could pick up and kind of another timeline would open or ... j

not really a new one as previously 2017 was still stupid writing and hiding in the forest andreas territory ... but such a idealized romantication of real showing itself social and financial trends ... could be described as follows ...                                                            

in 2017 the author of this fantasy autobio mix ... was more and more becoming obsessed with the possibilities he could write himself into ... like ... projecting this or that to happen causing this or that real world market trend... this morning andreas got invited by a stretch textile sensor producer to engage in a customized production talk ... like ... a mail to all the people having shown an interest in the tech perhaps via a ... inform me of news ... signup ... where i was asked ( if i remember correctly ) wether i had an actual or planned motion capture project where stretch sensors could be usefull for ... yes ... andreas wanting to become ascende soon ... was thinking ... but have not got the money to buy sensors ... of course andreas could invest hundred a month of his income reserved for food and transport clothes... as he was living simple ... stitching repairing trousers shirts ... eating self cooked food made of mostly vegetables and protein grains ... visiting social places where food was given free to people earning not the avarage sum of money a month ...                                                            so let andreas become ascende today with this vision ... 700 billions flow back to africa... 300 billions to south america ... 500 to asia ... 300 to australia ... and not to european north american asian companies building tarmac streets and private owned ports ... naah this fantasy involves a stranger bold alternative reality ... in september 2017  some dozends of financially potent nation states decid

... decided to back investment plans directly into local villages in africa americas asia and australias ... mostly poor people would be targeted as recipients for both money as investment into their street building port constructing railway building activities ... the investments from thousands of multimillionaires and some private billionaires were funneled into the hands of the little people in the local villages ... some money was blockchain wise transparently distributed to private people, some to local administrations which have agreed on the total transparency nature of this investment protection plan ... as the industrially sucessfull countries have set a matching sum aside to back the private investments ... so if the half of private investors who would want interest and were not interested in the free giving option... if their investments in a villages local solar panel collective or local street building company were not sucessfull... the states would pay compensation to the private investors...                               also a project like hundred adolescents getting a 2000 costing ai robot self assembly kit to serve as.their parents exosceleton work loading relief ... could become non profitable ... this being a very realistic szenario  what somehow ashames ascende or andreas now in spring 2017 ... why guarantee investors allready having possibly profited wrongly from people ... a refund for development projects unsucessfull ? ... kind of racist eventually ... painting himself suces

sucessfully becoming multispecies on the way of constructing a life ark for 100 million given by billionaires backing a non meat eating no force schooling but unconditional basic income for everyone ... picturing oneself ... caucsian european white male sucesfull but african asian american coloured skinned people ... adolescents ... as failing to assemble the prebuilt or locally 3d printed parts of an ai robot helper ... naah i was never a fan of racist thoughts ... like ... we are one family of human beings who have developped differently according to the climates where we and our ancestors lived ... no coulour better than an other ... but each colour being nurtured by an other type of soil and sun intensities ... climate makes body types metabolism physical differences .... cold climate supports small and dense body ... hot climate light and thin ...                                                             so in september 2017 a wave of investments flowed into southern local communities bringing many millions of local citizens jobs and income, investments for trade stores market stands ...internet connectivity where people sold ananas and papaya over wallets in their smartphones ... blockchain tech backed ...  it was mostly sucessfull... productivity going up ... infrastructure being built what was now property of the local community administered in a corrupt free blockchain... the farmers and cooks and artisans ... the carpenters whole digging street builders ... the people carrying all the coffee and cacao bags being ship


cacao bags being shiped to europe and north america ... all this hardworking people had in 2018 or 2019 ... some ai robot lifesuits of the first or second generation ... helping them as externally worn lifesuits to lift their own bodies and loads ....                               one could even imagine some hundred thousands of adolescent europeans and americans japanese chinese to travel to africa south america asia australia to assist volunteer building maima like robohelpers                              just because they were like experiencing internet the last 8 years of their life and could eventually quicken the build of the robosuits ... ahh naah ..  sounds colonial again ... instead of delivering easy to construct kits one brings so called experts to foreign financially poorer places ... perhaps better not ... so andreas the author is taking himself out of this picture as he is somewhat feeling unconfortable thinking of him contributing thoughts.to real world happenings ... coward as i am ... i rather project an event 5 years into the future to a different place than to write such a text in form of a letter and send it to real world politicians in 2017 as a suggestion how this region could help construct a framework for global financial redistribution towards devellopment goals ... naah ... andreas has done some letter writing some years ago for smaller ideas to some politicians, not much and not so loud or bold ... nowadays he retreats with his ideas to real world politics onto his social network notes page and tweets 

 tweets about it ... andreas is no activist nor scientist but mainly a thought concept story dream experimentalist ... his semi factual texts ...not deliberatly wrong facts but unprecise rememberings applying speculations ... his texts being a playground for himself to provide an environment where he could sketch out scenarios making him feel good and worthy ... having thought of a.scenario what brings social and environmental benefits

newborn ascende andreas can think of munusha who lives as a 14 year old girl with black skin in a small congolese village where she gets some of the 1000s of billions money returned to africa in 2017-2019 ... with her 2000 she gets to build an exosceleton assistant for her father and mother as work relief and for herself as learning and playing companion ... replacing need to build schools and pay teachers as millions of likewise equipped adolescents would teach themselves via net groups and would even pass some of the knowledge to their parents and younger brothers and sisters .... 2000 was well invested resulting in munusha enabling her father to earn 50 percent more with half the work stress on him ... also her mother did not need to carry so heavy with the fruit baskets on her way to market                                                            munusha was the proprietor or registered onto human life companion ai robot what she called lituramsa ... strange one would think this name in africa ... but the author andreas who decided to rebirth himself today into ascende ... just to get it over with and not allways avoid this very.moment in the various different ascende timelines where the author would become the actor.. the activist ....                              ascende in 2017 wished nothing more than the crimes of colonialisation to be repaired and black red yellow brown coloured humans to be given the money back white man has stolen from southern communities during the last five hundred years ... if ascende had to choose between a future where

where he would write some dozens of other short novels and articles but maima would not come into his life nor perma nor mary the lifeship... like he would grow 80 and still live in a rented appartement ... he would say yes today if instead of him having an ai companion microalgae feeding him another thousands and millions of african asian south americans aborigenees natives indigineous would be donated exoskeletons to support their families escape feom survival threatening economic poverty                                                            yes the ascende too cowardly to be an acrivist to write a letter to parliament asking for blockchain based reparations for slavery and colonialism be paid ... he would exchange his furure companioship at anytime for a future where munusha the 14 year old congolese black skinned girl would get a lifesuit ai robot kit before him or instead of him                              as she deserved.it more than him ... as she was in dire situation survival not that comfortably secured as ascendes european lazy dance theoretician experimentel writers therapy
