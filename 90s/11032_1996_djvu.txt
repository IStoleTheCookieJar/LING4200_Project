ABS publications draw extensively on information provided by individuals, businesses, 
fovernments and other organisations. Their continued cooperation is very much appreciated. 
Without it, the wide range of statistics published by the ABS would not be available. Information 
received by the ABS is treated in confidence as required by the Census and Statistics Act 1905. 


Preface 
Lee ea 


There is a vast range of statistical information available - from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 
and from other sources - covering almost every possible area of interest. The statistics themselves have 
value from three perspectives .... 


LJ they have value in their own right, in that they provide us with a quantitative representation at a 
paint in time - they tell us what is happening at that one point in time; 


[] they have value when they can be compared with the same information from another point in time 
- to be part of a time series that enables us to track the extent of the change over a period of 
time; and 


L] they have value when we can compare the information geographically - when we can compare the 
Statistics for one area with those from another. 


It is this last aspect of statistical information - the spatial or geographical perspective - that is the focus 
of this publication. It is a book of maps that show the boundaries and areas of all parts of Victoria, to 
assist people in identifying and understanding those areas to which statistical information can refer. 


The ABS has developed a spatial classification structure to enable statistical information to be presented 
in a consistent format. This classification - the Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) - 
uses the Statistical Local Area (SLA) as a building block; the maps presented in Statistical Geography, 
Victoria identify the SLA boundaries and their relationships to the associated Local Government Area (LGA) 
boundaries. 


Local Government Authorities have undergone dramatic change in Victoria since 1993, resulting in a 
reduction in the number of LGAs from 210 in 1993 to 78 in 1995. In this respect, this publication is 
essential in identifying the scale and extent of those changes. 

| view Statistical Geography, Victoria - in conjunction with the statistical information that the ABS and 
other organisations have to offer - as being a key part of helping people to better understand the value of 
geographical information in Victoria.

4 Statistical Geography, Victoria 


Introduction 
a 


Users of statistical information who wish to 
compare statistics between different geographical 
areas, or for a particular area between different 
points in time, need to be able to identify and 
understand the areas to which the information 
refers. ABS publishes statistical information which 
relates to areas as defined in the Australian 
Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC)}. 


Statistical Geography, Victoria illustrates the 
Statistical geography of Victoria as defined in the 
1996 Edition of the ASGC (1216.0). It aiso 
highlights, through the maps, changes which have 
occurred to ASGC spatial units in Victoria since the 
1991 Census of Population and Housing. 


The ASGC is a classification system designed and 
maintained by the ABS. It divides Australia into 
geographical areas for the purpose of collecting 
and disseminating statistics. All ABS statistical 
collections use the ASGC, as do many other 
government and non-government providers of 
Statistical information, 


Major changes to Victoria's statistical geography 
occurred as a result of the Victorian Government's 
restructuring of municipal boundaries, which 
commenced in May 1993 (see table below). 


The restructuring process went well beyond minor 
boundary adjustments or simple amalgamations of 
smaller LGAs. 


in 1991 most SLAs equated to LGAs. However, 
since the reduction in the number of LGAs in 
Victoria, from 210 in 1993 to 78 in 1996, the 
majority of SLAs are smaller than LGAs. 


At 1 July 1996 there were 200 SLAs in Victoria. 
Although there have been major changes in LGAs, 
with all but one being altered, there are 36 SLAs 
(18%) which remained comparable in area between 
1991 and 1996. There are also some others 
where only minimal change has occurred. 


Time series of regional statistical data show major 
breaks between 1994 and 1996, reflecting the 
complexity of the changes to local government 
boundaries. This makes comparisons of data 
across the 1990s very difficult. For example, 
agricultural production by LGA in 1996 will be very 
difficult to retate to data on production in 1993. 


For some statistics, the ABS can provide bridging 
series. In the case of the 1991 Census of 
Population and Housing, the ABS can project 1991 
data onto the 1996 geography as a special data 
service. This is only possible for a limited number 
of ABS statistical series.

Interpretation of the maps 


The vast majority of this publication presents maps for each of the Local Government Areas (LGAs) within 
Victoria. The LGAs are presented in alphabetical order - one LGA per page - using the current name of 
the LGA. Each map shows the LGA boundary outlined with a solid red line and the area shaded in grey - 
together with an indication of the new LGAs which adjoin that boundary. The name of the new LGA is 
shown at the top of the page. The names of old LGAs are shown in black print in the map and the names 
of new LGAS Surrounding the subject of the map are shown in blue print. As with the LGA name, the LGA 
boundaries are those that exist as at 5.8,1995. 


Where an LGA has been divided to create SLAs, those boundaries are shown with a broken red line. In 
nine cases in Victoria, the LGA is not divided and the SLA and LGA cover the same area. The SLA 
statistical reference code is a four digit number and appears inside the SLA area on the maps in blue. 
The SLA codes also appear in the list of SLAs on pages 8-10. 


To assist in understanding the extent of the LGA boundary changes that occurred around 1995, the maps 
aiso identify those areas which were transferred to create the new LGAs, and thus their new boundaries. 
The composition of a new LGA is illustrated to show the boundary changes that have taken place. 


These aspects can be illustrated using the map below, for Corangamite (S). 


= The new LGA, Shire of Corangamite, is outlined in solid red and shaded in grey. 

= The new LGAs that adjoin, also outlined in solid red, are Pyrenees (S) to the north, Moyne (3) to 
the west, and Golden Plains (S) and Colac-Otway (S) to the east. 

= Corangamite has been divided into two SLAs, separated by a broken red line, each with a four-digit 
code shown in biue. 

1] 1831 identifies essentially the old Shire of Hampden. 

O 1832 identifies the remainder of the new Shire of Corangamite - which is essentially the 
old Shire of Heytesbury. 

= There are two areas in the west of the new LGA that were added from the old LGAs of Mortlake (S) 
and Warrnambool (8). Similarly, in the south-east corner of the new LGA, there is another area 
which was transferred from Otway (S) and in the centre of the new LGA, the old LGA of 
Camperdown (T) is shown. Another area is shown as being transferred from the old LGA of 
Heytesbury (S) ta the new LGA of Colac-Otway (S).

Glossary 


CRE as 


ASGC 


The ASGC is an hierarchicat structure, covering the 
whole of Australia, upon which ABS statistical 
geography is based. 


Statistical Division (SD) 


Statistical Divisions are the larger of two ASGC 
general purpose regional types of spatial units, and 
consist of one or more Statistical Subdivisions 
covering, in aggregate, the whoie of Australia 
without gaps or overlaps. SDs are designed to be 
relatively homogeneaus regions characterised by 
identiftable social and economic links between the 
inhabitants and the economic units in the region, 
under the unifying influence of one or more major 
towns or cities. 


Statisticaf Subdivision (SSD) 


Statistical Subdivisions are the smaller of two ASGC 
general purpose regional types of spatial units. 
They consist of one or more Statistical Local Areas 
and cover, in aggregate, the whcle of Australia 
without gaps or overlaps. 


Statistical Local Area (SLA) 


Statistical Local Areas consist of at least one 
Census Collection District and cover, in aggregate, 
the whole of Australia without gaps or overlaps. 
They are the key intermediate spatial units for the 
dissemination of Census of Population and Housing 
data and the smallest spatial unit for the 
dissemination of economic, social and 
demographic statistics (other than those collected 
in population censuses), 


SLAs can be whole or part Local Government Areas 
(LGAs) or an unincerperated area. Where an area 
is unincorporated, ié net part of an LGA, an SLA is 
created. In the ASGC, oil rigs and other man-made 
platforms are formed into Off-Shore Areas, For 
Population Census purposes, people in transit are 
classified as being migratory. The two groups 
combined form an Off-Shore Areas and Migratory 
SLA. 


Collection District (CD) 


The Coliection District is the smallest type of spatial 
unit in the ASGC, being the building block for. 


creating ASGC and other areas. It is also the basic 
unit for collecting and disseminating Population 
Census data. CDs are defined for each census and 
are current for the period between censuses. 


In Urban areas there is an average of about 250 
dwellings in each CD. In rural areas the number of 
dwellings per CD declines as population densities 
decrease. 


Statistical District (S Dist.) 


Statistical Districts are generally defined around 
selected urban areas with a population of 25,000 
or more outside the capital city Statistical Division. 
Statistical Districts are intended to contain the 
anticipated urban spread for at least 20 years and 
are comprised of one or more Statistical 
Subdivisions. 


Local Government Area (LGA) 


In Victoria Local Government Areas are spatial units 
which represent the whole geographical area of 
responsibility of all incorporated loca! government 
councils. LGAs consist of one or more whole 
Statistical Local Areas. 


Estimated Resident Population (ERP) 


The estimated resident population figures shown in 
this publication for Statistical Local Areas and Local 
Government Areas have been compiled according 
to the place of usual residence of the population, 
The figures, as at 30 June 1995, are based on 
LGA boundaries in existence at 5 August 1995 and 
SLA boundaries at 1 July 1996. 


Note - as this glossary provides only basic definitions of terms 
whieh relate to maps in Statistical Geography, Victoria, users 
should refer to the ASGC, Statistical Geography Volume i: 
Australian Standard Geographical Classification 1996 Edition 
(1216.0) for a fuller description of the complete geographic 
hierarchical structure.

ABS statistical mapping capability 


The ABS has the statistical mapping capability to provide users with useful information relating to their 
statistical geography needs. The following pages illustrate examples of this capability, 


Example 1 This map shows CDs within the LGA of Darebin. It indicates relevant boundaries and 


selected identifying topographical features. A CD is represented by a seven digit code, 
such as 2141301, as shown on this map.

Exampie 3 This map shows the areas of the former Shires of Kowree, Arapiles and Wimmera and the 

City of Horsham which amalgamated, following the LGA restructuring process, to form the 

existing Rural City of Horsham. The ABS is able to provide for clients an estimate of the number of 

dwellings, population and sq km associated with the areas involved in the amalgamation process for 
any Victorian LGAs specified.

Example 4 If an area a client wishes to map does not fall conveniently within a particular CD, SLA or 

LGA, is there a solution? Yes - the ABS can tailor a map to suit exactly the area specified. 

For example, the map below focuses on a 2 kilometre radius from Chadstone Shopping Cente, 
encompassing portions of four LGAs.

Example 5 The following map is an example of output provided by CDATAQ1 (2721.2). CDATA is an 

ABS CD-ROM product which contains Population Census data, digital boundaries and 

base map data, with software to produce tables, maps and graphs of the data. The product makes 

possible desktop analysis of valuable information - age, education, housing, income, transport, religion, 

occupation, and more, from a single Collection District to an entire State or total Australia. The 

example below shows 1991 income distribution in the Melbourne Statistical Division. The analysis of 
data from the 1996 Population Census will be available through CDATA96.
