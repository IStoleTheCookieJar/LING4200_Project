NOTES 


Statistics of industrial disputes are compiled mainly from data obtained from employers (both private and public sector) 
and trade unions concerning individual disputes, and from reports of government authorities. 


The statistics relate to disputes which involved stoppages of work in which ten working days or more were lost at the 


establishments where the stoppages occurred. 


Statistics on working days lost per thousand employees are calculated using estimates of employment from the Survey 


of Employment and Eamings and the Labour Force Survey. 


Explanatory Notes and a Glossary are published on pages 6 to 8 of this publication

EXPLANATORY NOTES 


Introduction 

The statistics in this publication relate to disputes 
which involved stoppages of work of ten working days or 
more at the establishments where the stoppages occurred. 
Ten working days is equivalent to the amount of ordinary 
time worked by ten people in one day, regardless of the 
length of stoppage, for example, 3,000 workers on strike 
for 2 hours would be counted as 750 working days lost 
(assuming they work an 8 hour day). 


2. The statistics of working days lost relate to the losses 
due to industrial disputes only (as defined in paragraph 2 
of the Glossary). Effects on other establishments, such as 
stand-downs because of lack of materials, disruption of 
transport services, power cuts, etc. are not included. 


3. The statistics of industrial disputes are compiled 
mainly from data obtained from employers (both private 
and public sector), from trade unions and from reports of 
government authorities. Particulars of some stoppages may 
have been estimated and the statistics therefore should be 
regarded as giving only a broad measure of the extent of 
industrial disputes as defined above. 


Change in methodology 

4. The basis for the calculation of working days lost per 
thousand employees was changed in January 1987 to in- 
clude estimates of employees from the Survey of 
Employment and Earnings. They are combined with es- 
timates of the number of employees in agriculture and in 
private households, obtained from the Labour Force Sur- 
vey. Estimates have been recalculated on this basis for 
each month back to June 1984 and are available on re- 
quest. In issues of this publication prior to January 1987, 
the estimates of numbers of employees were based entirely 
on Labour Force Survey data. The effect of the change is 
minimal at the ‘all industries’ level but is quite significant, 
in some cases, for individual industry groups. 


5. The basis for the calculation of the number of dis- 
putes was changed in December 1987 (see paragraph 2 of 
the Glossary). Before that date, where the causes of 
several disputes were the same (e.g. National Wage Case 
disputes) the disputes were counted as one dispute in each 
State or Territory in which they occurred, irrespective of 
whether they were directed or organised by one person or 
organisation, or whether the dispute occurred in more than 
one industry. The reason for the change was to align the 
method of counting the number of disputes with the Inter- 
national Labour Organisation guidelines. In accordance 
with this change in definition, estimates of the number of 
disputes shown in this bulletin for past periods have been 
revised. In issues of this publication prior to September 
1988, the number of disputes were counted on the old 
basis. Unpublished estimates of the number of disputes 
have been revised on the new basis from January 1985 and 
are available on request. The number of employees in- 
volved and working days lost remain unchanged. 


Reliability of estimates 

6. Inaccuracies may occur because of imperfections in 
information provided by respondents or in processing by 
the ABS. Although considerable care is taken in question- 
naire design; in the instructions given to respondents; and 
in editing the returns; these inaccuracies may occur in any 
enumeration, whether it be a full count or a sample.

GLOSSARY 


Cause of dispute 

The statistics of causes of industrial disputes relate to 
the reported main cause of the stoppage of work and not 
necessarily all causes that may have been responsible for 
the stoppage of work. For these reasons, the statistics do 
not reflect the relative importance of all causes of disputes 
as perceived by both employers and employees. The 
causes are classified from information supplied by 
employers and according to standards determined by the 
International Labour Organisation. The classification of 
causes is as follows: 


Wages. Claims involving general principles relating to 
wages e.g. increase (decrease) in wages; variation in 
method of payment or combined claims relating to wages, 
hours or conditions of work in which the claim about 
wages is deemed to be the most important. Combined 
claims in which other claims are deemed to be the most 
important are included under the relevant cause. Disputes 
over award restructuring are included under managerial 
policy. 


Hours of work. Claims involving general principles relat- 
ing to hours of work e.g. decrease (increase) in hours; 
distribution of hours. 


Leave, pensions, compensation. Claims involving general 
principles relating to holiday and leave provisions; pension 
and retirement provisions; workers’ compensation 
provisions; insertion of penal clause provisions in awards. 


Managerial policy. Disputes concerning the exercise of 
managerial control by employers e.g. terms and conditions 
of employment (other than disputes specifically about 
wages and hours); new awards; award restructuring; work 
practices; principles of promotion or deployment of staff 
including roster complaints and retrenchments; disciplinary 
matters including alleged victimization of union officials; 
employment of particular persons; disagreement with 
managerial decisions. 


Physical working conditions. Disputes concerning physical 
working conditions and safety issues e.g. protective cloth- 
ing and equipment; first aid services; uncomfortable 
working conditions; lack of, or the condition of, amenities; 
claims for assistance; shortage or poor distribution of 


equipment or material; condition of equipment; new . 


production methods and equipment; arduous physical 
tasks. 


Trade unionism. Disputes concerning employment of non- 
unionists, inter-union and intra-union disputes; sympathy 
stoppages in support of employees in another industry; 
recognition of union activities. 


Other. Disputes concerning protests directed against per- 
sons Or situations other than those relating to the 
employer/employee relationship e.g. political matters; 
fining and gaoling of persons; lack of work; lack of ade- 
quate transport; non-award public holidays; accidents and 
attendance at funerals. Stoppages for which no reason is 
given are also included in this category. 


Disputes 

2. For these statistics, an industrial dispute is defined as 
a withdrawal from work by a group of employees, or a 
refusal by an employer or a number of employers to per- 
mit some or all-of their employees to work, each 
withdrawal or refusal being made in order to enforce a 
demand, to resist a demand, or to express a grievance. 


3. A dispute affecting several establishments is counted 
as a single dispute if it is organised or directed by one 
person or organisation in each State or Territory in which 
it occurs; otherwise it is counted as a separate dispute at 
each establishment (in each State or Territory) and in each 
industry in which it occurred. Prior to December 1987 dis- 
putes were counted differently (refer to paragraph 5 of the 
Explanatory Notes for details). 


4. When there is a return to work between stoppages 
over the same issue, and the return to work is for less than 
two complete months, the stoppages are counted as a 
single dispute. When the return to work is for two or more 
months, the dispute is considered to have ended at the time 
of the return to work. Should a subsequent stoppage 
occur, it is counted as a new dispute. 


5. Information is recorded concerning all industrial dis- 
putes where ten or more working days are lost (see 
paragraph 1 of the Explanatory Notes). Included in these 
Statistics are the following types of industrial disputes: 


© unauthorised stopwork meetings; 
© unofficial strikes; 


© sympathetic strikes (e.g. strikes in support of a 
group of workers already on strike); 


© political or protest strikes; 
© general strikes; 


© work stoppages initiated by employers 
(e.g. lockouts); and 


® rotating or revolving strikes (i.e. strikes which 
occur when workers at different locations take turns 
to stop work). 
Excluded from these statistics are work-to-rules, go-slows, 
bans (e.g. overtime bans) and sit-ins. In addition, in- 
dustrial disputes in which employees resign are deemed to 
have been resolved. Statistics on those disputes will cease 
to be collected from the date of the employees’ resigna- 
tions. 


Disputes in progress 

6. Disputes in progress refers to all disputes occurring 
within a particular calendar month or year. These disputes 
may: 


¢ start in the previous month or year and continue 
into the period being measured, or 
© begin and end in the period being measured, or 


® begin in the period being measured and continue 
into the next period. 


Duration of dispute 

7. The duration of a dispute is the average number of 
working days lost per employee involved in the dispute. 
The duration of the dispute is calculated by dividing the 
total number of working days lost in the dispute by the 
number of employees involved (both directly and indirect- 


ly). 


Employees 

8. Employees refer to wage and salary eamers only. Ex- 
cluded are persons who are self-employed (e.g. building 
sub-contractors, owner-drivers of trucks) and employers. 


9. Employees directly involved are those who actually 
participated in the dispute in order to enforce or resist a 
demand or to express a grievance. 


10. Employees indirectly involved are those who ceased 
work at the establishment where the stoppages occurred, 
but who are not themselves parties to the dispute. 
Employees who ceased work at establishments other than 
those where the stoppages occurred are excluded. See 
paragraph 2 of the Explanatory Notes. 


11. Total employees involved for any period of: time are 
obtained by adding together the number of employees in- 
volved in each dispute in the period. For any period of 
time the figures may include details of the same 
employees involved in more than one dispute. The longer 
the period of reference, the more chance there is of some 
double counting in the number of employees involved. 
Where there are varying numbers of employees involved 
during the progress of a dispute, the figures of employees 
involved relate to the largest number of individual 
employees involved on any one day. Generally, the total 
number of employees involved for each year will equal the 
sum of the total number of employees involved in the first 
month of a year plus the number of employees newly in- 
volved in subsequent months. Differences between 
monthly and annual totals can occur due to the temporary 
cessation of stoppages which resume in subsequent 
months. Employees re-involved in this type of dispute are 
not classified as employees newly involved in stoppages in 
the second period in which the dispute occurs. 


Method of settlement 

12. Statistics of the method of settlement of industrial dis- 
putes relate to the method directly responsible for ending 
the stoppage of work as reported and not necessarily to the 
method (or methods) responsible for settling all matters in 
dispute. For these reasons, they do not reflect the relative 
importance of the work of various industrial tribunals

operating under State and Federal legislation. The clas- 
sification of method of settlement is as follows: 


Negotiation. Private negotiation between the parties in- 
volved, or their representatives, without the intervention or 
assistance of authorities constituted under State or Federal 
industrial legislation. 


State legislation. Intervention or assistance of an industrial 
authority or authorities created by or constituted under 
State conciliation and arbitration or wages board legisla- 
tion, or reference to such authorities or compulsory or 
voluntary conference. Intervention, assistance or advice of 
State government officials or inspectors. 


Federal and joint Federal-State legislation. Compulsory or 
voluntary conference or by intervention or assistance, of, 
or reference to, the industrial relation commissions created 
by or constituted under the Industrial Relations Act, Coal 
Industry Acts, Stevedoring Industry Act, and other acts 
such as the Navigation Act; Public Service Arbitration 
Act. Intervention, assistance or advice of Federal govern- 
ment officials or inspectors. 


Resumption without negotiation. This category may in- 
clude some disputes which are settled subject to 
subsequent negotiation of a formal nature, such as in- 
dustrial court hearings. Stop-work meetings are included, 
and this category may also include disputes settled by 
‘resumption’ as stated, but about which no further infor- 
mation is available. 


Other methods. Mediation; filling places of employees on 
strike or locked out; closing establishments permanently; 
dismissal or resignation of employees. 


Working days lost 

13. Working days lost refer to working days lost by 
employees directly and indirectly involved in the dispute 
and figures are generally as reported by parties to the dis- 
pute. For some disputes working days lost are estimated on 
the basis of the number of employees involved and the 
duration of the dispute. 


Working days lost per thousand employees 

14. Working days lost per thousand employees are calcu- 
lated for the 12 month period from working days lost and 
estimates of employees obtained from the ABS Survey of 
Employment and Earnings and the ABS Labour Force Sur- 
vey. Refer to paragraph 4 of the Explanatory Notes for 
details of the way in which these measures are calculated, 
and the change in the method of calculation from 1987.
