CHANGES IN THIS ISSUE 


State and Regional Indicators, Victoria is released on a quarterly basis with chapters 
updated when new data are available. Chapters and tables are only included when new 
data are available, so the number of chapters and tables may vary between issues. 


A new chapter in this issue is Health. Additional content to spotlight some recent ABS 
annual releases has also been added to the Work and Income chapter. 


The table 'Condition of VicRoads Network, By Local Government Area - 2007-08' was 
expected to be published in this issue of the publication, however the data are not yet 
available. 


EXPLANATORY NOTES 
Explanatory notes in the form found in other ABS publications are not included in State and 


Regional Indicators, Victoria. For detailed information on the statistics, users are directed 
to the Explanatory notes contained in related ABS publications. 


Users are advised that small area estimates presented in this publication should be used 
with care. 


Due to rounding, discrepancies may occur between sums of the component items and totals 
in individual tables, and between totals in related tables. 

REVIEW OF DISSEMINATION STRATEGY 

A review of the ABS Victorian Office dissemination strategy for Victorian state and regional 
statistics, including both State and Regional Indicators, Victoria and the newsletter 
Statistics Victoria (cat. no. 1100.2) has recently been completed. Recommendations are 


currently being considered, and publications will continue as usual in the meantime. 


Thank-you to all those who provided feedback and participated in the process.

About this Release 


State and Regional Indicators, Victoria (SRIV) is a quarterly publication that contains 
recently released statistical information about the whole of Victoria. Data is sourced from 
ABS and non-ABS collections. It provides measures according to a triple bottom line of 
economic, social and environment elements. 


Most chapters contain a mix of tables, charts and commentary, to provide a basic analysis of 
recent movements in key economic, social and environmental data. Data is presented for 
varying geographic classifications, including, Victoria; Melbourne and the Balance of 
Victoria; down to Local Government Area for some series. The aim of the publication is to 
provide a picture of the situation of Victoria and enable comparison, both over time and 
between regions. 


Core data, such as Estimated Resident Population, State Final Demand, Labour Force 
Statistics, Price Indexes, Building Approvals, Air Quality, and Water Storage Volumes is 
complemented by periodic annual data including the Condition of VicRoads Network, 
Recorded Crime Offences, Life Expectancy at Birth, Government Owned Housing Stock and 
others. 


As the information is sourced from a wide variety of collections, care needs to be taken 
when analysing the data as time periods, definitions, methodologies, scope and coverage 
may differ from table to table. Advice is provided in the publication on such matters.

ESTIMATED RESIDENT POPULATION 


Victoria's estimated resident population (ERP) at the end of any given period is the 
estimated population at the beginning of the period plus the sum of three components: 


natural increase, net overseas migration and net interstate migration. 


At the end of September quarter 2009, Victoria's ERP was 5,473,300 people, an increase of 
30,000 (0.6%) since the end of June quarter 2009. Over the same period, Australia's ERP 
grew by 110,400 (0.5%). 


Over the 12 months since the end of September quarter 2008, Victoria's ERP increased by 
117,900 (2.2%). 


The largest component of Victoria's population growth in September quarter 2009 was net 
overseas migration (a gain of 20,700 people). Natural increase (births minus deaths) 
accounted for a further increase of 9,100 people. 


Net interstate migration has historically meant loss of population from Victoria to other states 
and territories. However, following eleven consecutive quarters of loss, net interstate 
migration made a positive contribution to the state's population during the March, June and 
September quarters 2009. In September quarter 2009 the contribution of net interstate 
migration was 200 people.

CAUSES OF DEATH, VICTORIA, 2008 


Statistics on causes of death are one of the oldest and most comprehensive set of health 
statistics available in Australia, and can provide insights into the impact of disease on 
Australian society. Causes of death information provide insights into the diseases and 
factors which are responsible for reducing life expectancy. 


Ranking causes of death is a useful method of describing patterns of mortality ina 
population. It allows comparison over time and between populations, however, different 
methods of grouping causes of death can result in a vastly different list of leading causes for 
any given population. The ranking of leading causes of death in the following sections are 
based on research presented in the Bulletin of the World Health Organisation, Volume 
84, Number 4, April 2006, 257-336 and have been classified using the 10th revision of the 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Please refer to Causes of Death, Australia, 
2008 (cat. no. 3303.0) Explanatory Notes for further information. 


In the following chapter, 'Victorian deaths' relate to deaths of Victorian usual residents, 
regardless of where in Australia the death occurred and was registered, as well as deaths 
registered in Victoria of persons who usually reside overseas. 


The number of deaths registered each year continues to increase as the size and age of the 
Victorian population increases. In 2008, there were 35,497 Victorian deaths, 7.8% more than 
the number registered in 2003 and 11% higher than in 1999. Males accounted for half of 


Victorian deaths registered in 2008. All coroner certified deaths registered after 1 January 
2007 are now subject to a revisions process after 12 and 24 months. The data contained in 
the following chapter includes 2008 (preliminary) data which are subject to a revisions 
process. For more information see Technical Note 2: Causes of Death - Revisions Process. 
Recent process improvements have positively impacted data for 2008, for further 
information see Technical Note 1: 2008 COD Collection - Process Improvements. 


In 2008, the leading underlying cause of death for all Victorians was Ischaemic heart 
diseases (120-125), which includes angina, blocked arteries of the heart and heart attacks. 
Ischaemic heart diseases were identified as the underlying cause of 5,670 deaths, 16% of 
all deaths registered in 2008. While Ischaemic heart diseases have been the leading cause 
of death since 1999, the number of deaths due to this cause has decreased, from 6,520 
(20% of all deaths) in 1999 to 5,670 (16% of all deaths) in 2008. 


Cerebrovascular disease [Strokes] (160-169) remained the second leading underlying cause 
of death in 2008. Strokes include haemorrhages, strokes, infarctions and blocked arteries of 
the brain. Compared to 10 years ago, deaths due to this cause decreased by 5.5%, from 
2,903 deaths in 1999 to 2,744 deaths in 2008. The proportion of all deaths attributed to 
Strokes has decreased over the last 10 years, from 9.1% of deaths in 1999 to 7.7% in 2008. 


Dementia and Alzheimer's disease (F01, FO3, G30) was the third leading cause of death in 
2008. The number of deaths due to this cause increased by 139%, from 924 deaths in 1999 
to 2208 deaths in 2008.

Leading Causes of Death by Gender 


Ischaemic heart diseases (120-125) were the leading cause of death for both males and 
females in 2008, with 2,924 and 2,746 deaths respectively. This reflects a ratio of 106 male 
deaths for every 100 female deaths. 


The leading causes of death vary between the sexes, in part due to the incidence of gender 
specific causes, such as Prostate or Ovarian cancer. However, other causes which may not 
be gender-specific also show variance between the sexes. Examples of these include: 


= Trachea and lung cancers (C33-C34), for which there were 178 male deaths for every 
100 female deaths 

= Chronic lower respiratory diseases (J40-J47), for which there were 116 male deaths 
for every 100 female deaths 

= Strokes (160-169), for which there were 65 male deaths for every 100 female deaths 

=» Dementia and Alzheimer's disease (FO1, FO3, G30), for which there were 48 male 
deaths for every 100 female deaths. 


Those causes where a high proportion of deaths were males include: 


# Intentional self harm [Suicide] (X60-X84) - 78% 

= Cirrhosis and other diseases of the liver (K70-K77) - 67% 
= Trachea and lung cancers (C33-C34) - 64% 

» Skin Cancers (C43-C44) - 63%

derived from them are subject to sampling variability. This chapter includes commentary on 
movements in estimates between different time periods, as well as other comparisons 
between categories or geographic regions. Testing of statistical significance has not been 
undertaken, therefore some of the commentary may refer to movements or comparisons 
which are not statistically significant. Standard errors for estimates in the Labour Force 
Survey can be calculated by using the spreadsheet contained in Labour Force Survey 
Standard Errors, Data Cube (cat. no. 6298.0.55.001).

Small area unemployment rate estimates

SMALL AREA UNEMPLOYMENT RATE ESTIMATES 


The Australian Government Department of Education, Employment and Workplace 
Relations (DEEWR) produce unemployment rate estimates at Statistical Local Area (SLA) 
level, using information derived from the ABS Labour Force Survey (LFS), supplemented by 
small area data from the ABS Census of Population and Housing and Centrelink. 


DEEWR has made the transition to the geographic classification and population 
benchmarks now used in the LFS (based on the 2006 Census of Population and Housing) 
from those used previously (based on the 2001 Census). Unemployment estimates for SLAs 
and aggregates thereof for periods prior to March quarter 2008 are based on 2001 Census- 
based population benchmarks. For most areas, there has been no impact from the change 
in geographic classification. Further details can be found in paragraphs 2-5 of the 
Explanatory Notes. 


The series presented in the commentary below and in the underlying table is the DEEWR 
‘smoothed series’. The quarterly estimates have been smoothed using a four-quarter 


average ending in the reference quarter. Therefore, the reference period refers to an 
average over the year ended the last month of the reference quarter (for example, June 
quarter 2009 refers to the average of the four quarters from September quarter 2008 to June 
quarter 2009, or the average over the year ended June 2009). 


In September quarter 2009, the highest unemployment rates were recorded in the LGAs of 
Greater Dandenong (10.4%), Central Goldfields (9.6%) and Brimbank (8.8%), while the 
lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Nillumbik (1.7%), South Gippsland (2.8%) and 
Macedon Ranges (2.8%). In September quarter 2009, 53.2% of Victorian LGAs recorded an 
unemployment rate of less than or equal to 5.0%.

AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS 


A sample redesign based on Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial 
Classification, 2006 (ANZSICO06) (cat. no. 1292.0) was introduced into the Average Weekly 
Earnings (AWE) survey in August 2009, along with some improvements to the survey frame. 
These changes have resulted in a shift in the level of the series. The difference in the level 
of the two series (ANZSICO6 and ANZSIC93) has been measured and backcast into the 
historical series to make a time series of estimates on an ANZSICO6 basis. Because of the 
extent of changes in level estimates, quarterly and annual percentage change movements 
for the new ANZSICO6 series are not identical to those under the old ANZSIC93 series. 
Differences at the state, sector and Australia levels are generally insignificant and within 
current released standard errors for each series. 


In November quarter 2009, the trend estimate of average weekly full-time adult ordinary time 
earnings in Victoria was $1,186.40, an increase of 4.5% from November quarter 2008. Over 
the same period, trend full-time adult ordinary time earnings increased by 5.8% for males 
and by 2.3% for females.

WAGE AND SALARY EARNERS 2003-04 TO 2006-07 


Estimates of Wage and salary income at small area level (including SLAs and LGAs) for 
each year from 2003-04 to 2006-07 have recently been compiled by the ABS from 
aggregate data sourced from the Australian Taxation Office's (ATO) Individual Income Tax 
Return Database. The data items compiled by the ABS using the ATO data relate to income 
standards the ABS uses for its income surveys that are defined in the Explanatory Notes of 
Wage and Salary Earner Statistics for Small Areas, Time Series, 2003-04 to 2006-07 (cat. 
no. 5673.0.55.003) . 


In 2006-07, Wages and salaries were the largest component of income accounting for $95.3 
billion, or 77.8% of all income earned by Victorian tax payers. On average, Victorians earned 
$41,260 in Wages and salaries in 2006-07; an increase of 3.5% since 2005-06. This 
commentary does not take into account the effect of inflation. 


Between 2003-04 and 2006-07 the average annual growth rate in average Wage and salary 
income in Victoria was 3.8%, compared to 4.5% for Australia. 


In the following comments, Wage and salary income was classified in accordance with the 


2006 Census categories of Lower (average annual income less than $20,800), Medium 
($20,800-$52,000) and Higher (Over $52,000) Incomes. The higher income category has 
been further divided into $52,000-$83,200 and $83,200 and over. For more information see: 
(Wage and Salary Earners Statistics for Small areas, Time Series, 2003-04 to 2006-07 (cat. 
no. 5673.0.55.003)). 


In Victoria, between 2003-04 and 2006-07, the proportion of Wage and salary earners in the 
Lower income group fell by 2.4 percentage points. There was also a decrease in the 
proportion of Wage and salary earners in the Medium income group of 3.6 percentage 
points. Over the same period, the proportion of Wage and salary earners in the higher two 
income divisions ($52,000-$83,200 and over $83,200) increased by 3.5 and 2.5 percentage 
points respectively.

The following graph shows the distribution of Wage and salary earners in Victoria by age 
group for the lowest and highest income ranges. It shows that a large proportion (36.1%) of 
people who earned less than $20,800 were aged between 15 and 24 years, while two thirds 
of people (66.4%) who earned more than $83,200 were aged 35-54 years.

There were differences in the Wages and salaries earned by males and females in Victoria 
in 2006-07, with a total of 148,500 males (12.4%) earning more than $83,200 compared to 
33,600 females (3.0%). In addition, 37.1% of females earned less than $20,800 compared 
to 23.0% of males. 


Of the people in Melbourne who earned over $83,200, the majority (80.4%) were male. This 
was also the case outside of the Melbourne area, with 88.5% of people who earned in 
excess of $83,200 being male. 


Among the LGAs in the Melbourne area, Bayside had the highest ($60,138) and Greater 
Dandenong had the lowest ($34,935) average Wage and salary income in 2006-07. In total, 
there were 40,300 Wage and salary earners in Bayside and 54,300 in Greater Dandenong. 
The higher average Wage and salary income observed in Bayside when compared to 
Greater Dandenong may be explained by the larger proportion of Managers and 
Administrators (19.2% compared to 5.4%), and Professionals (27.4% compared to 11.1%) in 
Bayside. 


In terms of income distribution, 30.3% of Wage and salary earners in Greater Dandenong, 
earned less than $20,800 and half (50.1%) earned between $20,800 to $52,000. In Bayside, 
a similar proportion ( 29.2%) of Wage and salary earners earned less than $20,800, 
however a smaller proportion (32.0%) earned between $20,800 to $52,000. A much higher 
proportion of Wage and salary earners in Bayside earned over $83,200, 19.2% compared to 
3.3% in Greater Dandenong.

For LGAs outside of the Melbourne area, Wage and salary earners in Macedon Ranges 
LGA had the highest average Wage and salary income ($42,745) and Buloke LGA had the 
lowest ($26,813). The number of Wage and salary earners in these two LGAs were 18,000 
and 2,500 respectively. 


The distribution of Wage and salary earners across different occupational groups were 
similar for these two LGAs, except that a large proportion of Wage and salary earners in 


Buloke were in the occupational category of Labour and Related Workers (21.8% compared 
to 8.5% in Macedon Ranges) .

STATE FINAL DEMAND 


State final demand is the estimate obtained by summing government final consumption 
expenditure, household final consumption expenditure, private gross fixed capital formation 
and the gross fixed capital formation of public corporations and general government. 


In December quarter 2009, the trend estimate for Victorian final demand, in volume terms, 
was $76,558 million, an increase of 1.8% from September quarter 2009. This was above the 
trend growth for New South Wales (1.6%) and Australian domestic final demand (1.4%) over 
the same period. 


Household final consumption expenditure is the largest component of state final demand, 


and accounted for 56.7% of the trend volume estimate of state final demand in December 
quarter 2009. The trend volume estimate of household final consumption expenditure 
increased by 0.6% from the previous quarter. The other main contributors to trend state final 
demand in December quarter 2009 were private gross fixed capital formation (23.3%) and 
government final consumption expenditure (15.8%).

HOUSE PRICE INDEXES 


The price index for established houses covers transactions in detached residential dwellings 
on their own block of land regardless of age (i.e. includes new houses sold as a house/land 


package as well as second-hand houses). Price changes therefore relate to changes in the 
total price of dwellings and land. 


A detailed description of the concepts, sources and methods behind the established house 
price index can be found in_House Price Indexes: Concepts, Sources and Methods, 
Australia (cat. no. 6464.0). This publication was re-released in December 2009, and covers 
the changes made in the stratification method and weights as a result of a review of the 
established house price index in 2007 and 2008, as well as more information on how the 
index is calculated and on price index concepts in general. 


Project homes are dwellings available for construction on an existing block of land. Price 
changes relate only to the cost of constructing the dwelling (excluding land). 


In March quarter 2010, the price index of project homes in Melbourne increased by 0.5% 
from the previous quarter. Based on preliminary estimates, the price index of established 
houses increased by 6.7% over the same period. Preliminary estimates of the weighted 
average of the eight capital cities showed an increase of 4.8% in established house prices 
and an increase of 0.9% in project home prices in March quarter 2010. 


From March quarter 2009 to March quarter 2010, established house prices in Melbourne 
increased by 27.7% and project home prices increased by 7.0%.

CONFIDENTIALITY OF MERCHANDISE TRADE STATISTICS 


The release of statistics for certain merchandise trade commodities is restricted in order to 
prevent the identification of the activities of an individual business, where it is requested by 
the business. These restrictions do not affect the total value of exports and imports for 
Australia, but they can affect statistics at disaggregated levels, including by state. 


Prior to September 2008, import commodities with confidentiality restrictions 'No commodity 
details’ or 'No value details' contributed to the relevant state and country totals, so that these 
totals showed the accurate level of trade. To ensure the confidentiality of data, this treatment 
changed in September 2008. Import commodities with these confidentiality restrictions are 
now excluded from all state-level data. Therefore, data on imports for Victoria may 
understate the actual amount of trade in Victoria, including the amount of trade with the 
state's major trading partners. 


From December 2008, some additional commodities have had a restriction of 'No 


commodity details' applied, and care should be taken when interpreting the data on 
Machinery and transport equipment in the commodity table in the chapter.

BALANCE OF MERCHANDISE TRADE 


In March 2010, the balance of international merchandise trade (i.e. the value of exports less 


the value of imports) for Victoria was a deficit of $3,019m. The value of the state's 


merchandise exports was $1,886m, while merchandise imports totalled $4,904m. Compared 


with March 2009, Victoria's trade deficit in March 2010 was $431m (16.7%) higher, with a 
rise in the value of exports (up $123m, or 7.0%) being offset by a larger rise in the value of 
imports (up $553m, or 12.7%). Victoria recorded an average monthly trade deficit of 
$2,785m for the 12 months ending March 2010. 


At the national level, the value of imports was 4.2% higher in March 2010 compared with 
March 2009, while the value of exports (including re-exports) was 18.2% lower over the 


same period.

TRADE BY COMMODITY 


More than a quarter (28.9%) of Victoria's merchandise exports in 2008-09 were Food and 
live animals, followed by Machinery and transport equipment (19.7%). Compared with 


2007-08, Food and live animals rose by $670m and Chemicals and related products rose by 
$355m. The largest decrease in exports was Machinery and transport equipment (-$791m). 


Food and live animals accounted for 30.5% of Victoria's exports in March quarter 2010, 
while Machinery and transport equipment contributed 18.2% of the total. 


Imports of Machinery and transport equipment comprised 38.4% of total Victorian imports in 
2008-09, more than twice the size of the next largest category (Miscellaneous manufactured 
articles, 17.6%). The largest increases from 2007-08 were in Miscellaneous manufactured 
articles ($1,442m) and Food and live animals ($421m). The largest decreases were in 
Machinery and transport equipment (-$1,440m) and Mineral fuels, lubricants and related 
materials (-$640m). 


In March quarter 2010, Machinery and transport equipment made up 39.5% of the state's 
imports, with a further 16.8% being Miscellaneous manufactured articles.

MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS 


Based on the volume of trade, Victoria's biggest trading partner in 2008-09 was China, with 
combined exports and imports of $13,565m. The next biggest trading partners were the 
United States of America, Japan, New Zealand and Germany. With the exception of New 
Zealand (a trade deficit of $633m), Victoria's largest trade deficits in 2008-09 were recorded 
with its biggest trading partners - China ($9,227m), the United States of America ($5,223m), 
Germany ($3,388m) and Japan ($3,105m). Over the same period, trade surpluses were 
recorded with four of the state's 30 major trading partners. The largest of these was with 
Saudi Arabia ($1,059m), followed by the United Arab Emirates ($506m). 


The top five destinations of Victoria's exports in March quarter 2010 were China, Japan, 
New Zealand, the United States of America and Saudi Arabia. Combined, 46.3% of the 
state's exports in the quarter went to these countries. Nearly one-fifth (19.7%) of imports to 
Victoria came from China, with the United States of America (11.7%) and Japan (10.4%) 
being the next two largest sources.

AIR QUALITY 


The Air Quality Index compiled by the Victorian Environment Protection Authority measures 
the concentration of various pollutants relative to the concentration levels at which they may 
cause harm. The lower the index is, the better the quality of our air. The index is available 
for four areas in the Port Phillip Region (East, West, City and Geelong) and the Latrobe 
Valley. 


The Visibility Pollutant Index is an indicator of visibility reduction, and is measured by the 
concentration of airborne particles relative to Victorian standards. Incidents of poor visibility 
are generally higher during the cooler months of autumn and winter (from May to 
September), whereas ozone levels are generally higher during the warmer months of spring 
and summer (from November to February).

WATER RESOURCES 


At the end of March 2010, Victoria's water storages were at 25.8% of their capacity at full 
service level of 14,020 GL. This was 0.7 percentage points lower than the level in February 
2010, and 9.7 percentage points higher than in March 2009. 


Melbourne's water storage level at the end of March 2010 was 34.0% of capacity. This was 
0.9 percentage points lower than in February 2010 and 4.9 percentage points higher than in 
March 2009. Rural water storages held 26.1% of their capacity at the end of March 2010, 
1.0 percentage points lower than in February 2010, and 10.3 percentage points higher than 
the level in March 2009. 


Between March 2009 and March 2010, the volume of water held in rural water storages 
increased by 58.5%. Lake Eildon in the Goulburn basin captured 44.7% of this increase, 
with a further 40.6% of the increase being in Murray basin storages. Just under three- 
quarters (73.9%) of the storage capacity at full service level of Victoria's rural water storages 
(9,396 GL) is represented by Lake Eildon (3,390 GL) and the state's share of Murray basin 
storages (3,557 GL). From March 2009 to March 2010, the volume of water in Lake Eildon 
increased from 13.1% of capacity to 25.0%. 


The total capacity of the state's storages reduced by 365 GL in April 2009 following the 
decommissioning of Lake Mokoan, while 38 GL was added to full capacity in June 2009 
when the Tarago Reservoir was added to the Melbourne supply system. A summary of 
changes to total storage capacity since December 2004 can be found in paragraph 19 of the

EXPLANATORY NOTES 


INTRODUCTION 


1 This quarterly publication contains data from both ABS and non-ABS sources. The ABS 
publications referenced within State and Regional Indicators, Victoria, as well as the 
websites of non-ABS organisations, are listed in paragraph 28. Users are directed to these 
references for further information. 


REGIONAL AND SMALL AREA LABOUR FORCE ESTIMATES 


2 The regions in Victoria for which the ABS produces estimates from the Labour Force 
Survey are revised at the time of the labour force sample redesign following each Census of 
Population and Housing and remain stable until the next labour force sample redesign. From 
November 2007, these regions are consistent with the SRs in the 2006 Edition of the ASGC. 
Consequently, the LGA boundary change between Melbourne (C) and Moonee Valley (C) is 
not reflected in LFS data. There were no changes to Victorian SR boundaries between 2001 
and 2006 that involved population. For further information on LFS data at regional level, 
please see Information Paper: Regional Labour Force Statistics (cat. no. 6262.0). Maps of 
SRs used in the LFS can be found in Australian Labour Market Statistics, Jul 2009 (cat. no. 
6105.0) on the Downloads page (6105.0 - Labour Force Region Maps - Victoria - 2007). 


3 The quarterly small area unemployment rate estimates produced by DEEWR are based 
on the regions used by the ABS in the LFS. Even though there were no changes to Victorian 
SR boundaries between 2001 and 2006, there have been changes to LGA boundaries 
involving population which may have impacted on the small area unemployment rate time 
series. These boundary changes have been incorporated into the estimates for the 
smoothed series (the series included in this publication) from September quarter 2008, and 
have not been backcast to earlier periods. In Victoria, the affected LGAs are: 


= Alpine (S) - previously included Falls Creek and Mount Hotham Alpine Resorts 
(estimated resident population of 163 at 30 June 2003); 

= Benalla (RC) - previously part of Delatite (S); 

= Mansfield (S) - previously part of Delatite (S); and 

= Unincorporated Vic. - previously only French Island, now includes Falls Creek, Mount 
Baw Baw, Mount Buller and Mount Hotham Alpine Resorts. 


4 Changes to SLA boundaries between 2001 and 2006 have affected the timing of the 
introduction of new LFS population benchmarks based on the 2006 Census of Population 
and Housing into the small area unemployment rate time series for the LGAs of Baw Baw 
(S), Campaspe (S), Colac-Otway (S), Greater Bendigo (C), Knox (C), Whittlesea (C) and 
Yarra Ranges (S). For these LGAs, the new benchmarks have been incorporated from 
September quarter 2008, which is two quarters later than other LGAs. The new benchmarks 
for Alpine (S) and Unincorporated Vic. have also been introduced from September quarter 
2008. 


5 The boundary changes to geographic areas and new population benchmarks described 
above were first introduced into the small area unemployment rate time series in March 
quarter 2009, with data for previous periods being revised back to either March quarter 2008 


or September quarter 2008. 


SMALL AREA ESTIMATES OF PERSONAL INCOME 


6 Estimates at small area level (including SLAs and LGAs) of the personal income people 
received from various sources for each year from 2003-04 to 2006-07 have recently been 
compiled by the ABS from aggregate data sourced from the Australian Taxation Office's 
(ATO) Individual Income Tax Return Database. The ATO database covers all individuals who 
submit an individual income tax return and includes persons with income from one or more 
of a range of sources such as wages and salaries, own business, superannuation and 
annuity, investments and government pensions, benefits or allowances. The data items 
compiled by the ABS using the ATO statistics relate to income standards the ABS uses for 
its income surveys and are defined in the Explanatory Notes of Estimates of Personal 
Income for Small Areas, Time Series, 2003-04 to 2006-07 (cat. no. 6524.0.55.002). 
Government pensions, benefits or allowances have been excluded from the scope of the 
ABS-compiled statistics. Downloadable data can be accessed from the Downloads page of 
that publication. 


7 All individual income tax statistics provided to the ABS by the ATO have been in 
aggregated form only, at the SLA level. Information about individual taxpayers has not been 
released to the ABS. 


8 Prior to being provided to the ABS, the statistics have also been subjected to a 
confidentiality process that randomly adjusts table cells with small values. This includes 
altering some small cells to zero. Caution should therefore be exercised in deducing that 
there are no people in an area with certain characteristics and, in general, no reliance 
should be placed on table cells with small values. The confidentiality process prevents the 
risk of inadvertently releasing any information that may identify an individual while 
preserving the overall information value of the statistics. 


STATE FINAL DEMAND 


9 September quarter 2009 saw the introduction of new international standards and new 
industry and sector classifications into the quarterly Australian National Accounts. These 
changes have resulted in revisions to the entire national accounts time series. The 
standards and classifications introduced are: 


» System of National Accounts 2008 (SNAO8), 

= Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition 
(BPM6), 

» Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification, 2006 (ANZSICO6) (cat. 
no. 1292.0), and 

» Standard Economic Sector Classifications of Australia, 2008 (SESCAO08) (cat. no. 
1218.0). 


10 The changes being implemented have impacted on the value of some key aggregates, 
and data quality improvements have also resulted in a shift in the level of some series. Level 
shifts have been backcast to the start of the respective time series. 


11 Changes have been made to components of private gross fixed capital formation: 


= ‘Cultivated biological resources’ replaces the previously published ‘Livestock’, and 


includes a new component of ‘Orchard growth’; and 
# ‘Intellectual property products’ replaces the previously published ‘Intangible fixed 
assets’, and includes a new component of ‘Research and development’. 


12 Further information and discussion on the introduction of these new standards and 
classifications can be found in Information Paper: Implementation of new international 
standards in ABS National and International Accounts, September 2009 (cat. no. 
5310.0.55.002). 


13 A revised Australian National Accounts: Concepts, Sources and Methods (cat. no. 
5216.0) is scheduled for release in late 2010. This product describes the underlying 
concepts and structure of the national accounts, and the sources, methods and terms used 
in compiling the estimates. However, the current (2000) version reflects SNA93 concepts 
and a number of references to data sources and methods may now be out of date. 


TOURISM REGIONS 


14 Tourism Regions are defined by relevant state/territory tourism organisations and 
represent groups of SLAs. Each year, any changes to Tourism Regions (including SLA 
boundary changes incorporated in the current edition of the ASGC) are applied from the first 
reference period of the Survey of Tourist Accommodation in the following calendar year (i.e. 
the March quarter). For a map of Victorian Tourism Regions, and a listing of SLAs within 
each Tourism Region, please see Tourism Region Maps and Concordance Files, Australia 
(cat. no. 9503.0.55.001). 


AIR QUALITY 


15 The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) reports air quality as an index for any given 
pollutant as its concentration expressed as a percentage of the relevant standard. It enables 
easy interpretation of whether the pollutant is at a level which may cause harm. An index 
value of 100 means the pollutant is currently at a concentration equal to the National 
Environment Protection Measure (Air NEPM) or State Environment Protection Policy (The 
Air Environment) (SEPP) standard levels (levels designed to protect human health and the 
environment). Indexes are calculated separately for each measured pollutant: Ozone, 
Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulfur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Fine Particulates (PM10), Visibility 
(Airborne Particle Index). For each station, the daily pollutant indexes are the maximum 
index values for that day. Note that not all pollutants are measured at each station. The EPA 
also calculates an overall Air Quality Index, which amalgamates each pollutant index into an 
overall measure of air quality at each station. 


16 The air quality data have been provided for the Ozone and Visibility (or Airborne Particle) 
Indexes as these are the dominant pollutants and are widely measured across the EPA 
network. It should also be noted that meteorological conditions are a major determinant on 
the incidence of elevated pollutant levels. Hence significant daily, seasonal and annual 
variations can be expected in air quality. For more information on air quality, see the EPA 
web site. 


17 The air quality index is converted into a qualitative scale with five commonly understood 
terms. Very good (0-33), Good (34-66) and Fair (67-99) represent measurements within the 
standards, while Poor (100-149) and Very poor (150+) represent measurements exceeding 
the standards. 


18 For air quality reporting purposes the Port Phillip Region (PPR) has been divided into 4 
regions: East, West, City and Geelong. Air monitoring stations assigned to each region are: 
East - Alphington, Brighton, Box Hill, Dandenong, Mooroolbark; City - RMIT, Richmond; 
West - Footscray, Melton, Point Cook, Paisley; Geelong - Point Henry, Geelong South. In 
addition, the Latrobe Valley has stations at Moe and Traralgon. The regional index is 
considered to be the maximum of the station indexes calculated within each particular 
region. The daily index reported for a region is the maximum region index recorded each 
day. 


CHANGES IN CAPACITY OF WATER STORAGES 


19 The capacity at full service level of Victoria's water storages changes periodically due to 
a number of factors including the commissioning and decommissioning of reservoirs, and 
the review of operational storage capacities of reservoirs. A Summary of changes affecting 
capacity at full service level is given below. 


=» December 2004: Capacity of storages in Werribee and Maribyrnong basins reduced 
by 7 GL; 

= April 2005: Capacity of Glenelg/Wimmera basin storages reduced by 24 GL; 

» January 2007: Moondarra Reservoir (capacity 30 GL, initial storage volume 23 GL) 
added to the Thomson/Latrobe basin; 

=» September 2008: Glenmaggie Reservoir (Thomson/Latrobe basin) capacity reduced 
by 12 GL; 

= April 2009: Lake Mokoan (Broken basin, capacity 365 GL) decommissioned; 

= June 2009: Tarago Reservoir (capacity 38 GL, initial storage volume 22 GL) added to 
the Melbourne supply system. 


MELBOURNE METROPOLITAN AREA 


20 Most of the small area data provided by non-ABS organisations are aggregates at Local 
Government Area (LGA) level. With one exception, LGAs do not cross Statistical Division 
(SD) boundaries, and therefore it is generally possible to form SD data from aggregate LGA 
data. However, while the majority of the Yarra Ranges (S) LGA is in the Melbourne SD, the 
Yarra Ranges (S) - Pt B SLA is in the Gippsland SD. As a result, in these instances it is not 
possible to derive data for Melbourne and Gippsland SDs as exactly defined in the 
Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) (cat. no. 1216.0). 


21 Where necessary, the Yarra Ranges (S) LGA as a whole is included with the LGAs in 
Melbourne SD to form a region referred to as the Melbourne Metropolitan Area (MMA). 
Consequently, in these instances Gippsland SD excludes Yarra Ranges (S) - Pt B SLA. 


22 As an indication of the relative size of Yarra Ranges (S) - Pt B SLA, at 30 June 2008 it 
had a preliminary estimated resident population (ERP) of 612 persons. At the same date, 
the total ERP of Yarra Ranges (S) LGA was 146,886, while Gippsland SD had a total ERP 
of 170,779. 


GEOGRAPHY AND MAPS 
23 Maps of SLAs, SSDs and SDs within Victoria can be found in Australian Standard 


Geographical Classification (ASGC) (cat. no. 1216.0) on the Downloads page (1216.0 - 
2009 ASGC - Victorian Maps). A listing of SLAs within each LGA (Local Government Areas 


and Statistical Local Areas - Alphabetic) can be accessed from the same page, along with 
listings of SLAs within each SD (Main Structure - Detailed) and Statistical Region (SR) 
(Statistical Region Structure - Detailed). 


24 Unless otherwise indicated, boundaries of LGAs, SDs and SRs referred to in this 
publication are consistent with those in the 2009 Edition of the ASGC. The most recent 
change to an LGA boundary in Victoria was effective from 1 July 2008 and involved 
Melbourne (C) gaining 111.8 hectares (and 5,712 persons based on preliminary ERP at 30 
June 2008) from Moonee Valley (C). 


Thematic maps 


25 This publication contains maps illustrating selected characteristics relating to the 
population in LGAs. For each map, five class intervals, each with a different colour shade, 
have been used to help interpret the distribution of the characteristic being mapped. LGAs 
with similar values are grouped in the same class, and the number of LGAs in each class 
will vary depending on the distribution of the population being mapped. 


26 Each map contains a legend showing the colour and values for each class of the mapped 
data. For simplicity, the ranges are shown as, for example, '9.7-16.3' and '16.3-23.0'. These 
should be read as ‘from 9.7 to less than 16.3' and ‘from 16.3 to less than 23.0’. Individual 
values appear in one range only.

Glossary 


GLOSSARY 
Chain volume measures 


Annually-reweighted chain Laspeyres volume price indexes referenced to the current price 
values in a chosen reference year (i.e. the year when the quarterly chain volume measures 
sum to the current price annual values). Chain Laspeyres volume measures are compiled by 
linking together (compounding) movements in volumes, calculated using the average prices 
of the previous financial year, and applying the compounded movements to the current price 
estimates of the reference year. 


Generally, chain volume measures are not additive. In other words, component chain 
volume measures do not sum to a total in the way original current price components do. In 
order to minimize the impact of this property, the ABS uses the latest base year as the 
reference year. By adopting this approach, additivity exists for the period following the 
reference year and non-additivity is relatively small for the years immediately preceding. A 
change in reference year changes levels but not growth rates, although some revision to 
recent growth rates can be expected because of the introduction of a more recent base year 
(and revisions to the current price estimates underlying the chain volume measures). 


Deficit and surplus 

A deficit occurs when the sum of all debit entries exceeds the sum of all credit entries, anda 
surplus occurs when the sum of all credit entries exceeds the sum of all debit entries. The 
term deficit (or surplus) can therefore be used in relation to various balances, e.g. balance of 
trade. 

Duration of unemployment 

The elapsed period to the end of the reference week since a person began looking for work, 
or since a person last worked for two weeks or more, whichever is the shorter. Brief periods 
of work (of less than two weeks) since the person began looking for work are disregarded. 
Employed 


Persons aged 15 years and over who, during the reference week: 


= worked for one hour or more for pay, profit, commission or payment in kind, in a job or 
business or on a farm (comprising employees, employers and own account workers); 


= worked for one hour or more without pay in a family business or on a farm (i.e. 
contributing family workers); 
= were employees who had a job but were not at work and were: 
e away from work for less than four weeks up to the end of the reference 
week; 
away from work for more than four weeks up to the end of the reference 
week and received pay for some or all of the four week period to the end of 
the reference week; 
e away from work as a standard work or shift arrangement; 
e on strike or locked out; 
e on workers’ compensation and expected to return to their job; 
= were employers or own account workers who had a job, business or farm, but were 
not at work. 


Part-time workers 


Employed persons who usually worked less than 35 hours a week (in all jobs) and either did 
so during the reference week, or were not at work in the reference week. 


Particles as PM,, 
Particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 micrometres or less. 
Photochemical oxidants and ozone 


‘Photochemical oxidants’ is the technical term for the type of smog found in Australian cities 
during the warmer months of the year. This type of smog can be invisible or it can appear as 
a whitish haze. 


Photochemical oxidants are formed when sunlight falls on a mixture of chemicals in the air. 
Ozone is one of the main photochemical oxidants. Other chemicals such as formaldehyde 
are also found and, like ozone, have adverse health effects. Environment agencies measure 
the level of ozone because it indicates the total amount of photochemical oxidants in the air. 
Cities that have abundant sunshine over periods of time, together with moderate winds and 
high temperatures, are most likely to experience high levels of photochemical oxidants. 


Ozone is a gas that is formed when nitrogen oxides react with a group of air pollutants 
known as ‘reactive organic substances’ in the presence of sunlight. The chemicals that react 
to form ozone come from sources such as: motor vehicle exhaust, oil refining, printing, 
petrochemicals, lawn mowing, aviation, bushfires and burning off. Motor vehicle exhaust 
fumes produce as much as 70% of the nitrogen oxides and 50% of the organic chemicals 
that form ozone. (Source: Australian Government Department of the Environment, Water,

Re-exports 


Re-exports are defined as goods, materials or articles originally imported into Australia 
which are exported in either the same condition in which they were imported, or after 
undergoing some minor operations (e.g. blending, packaging, bottling, cleaning and sorting) 
which leave them essentially unchanged. Included in international merchandise export 
statistics. 


Seasonal adjustment 


A means of removing the estimated effects of normal seasonal variations from economic 
time series so that the effects of other influences are obvious. Seasonal variations are the 
systematic (though not necessarily regular) intra-year movements of economic time series. 
These are often the result of non-economic phenomena, such as climatic changes and 
regular religious festivals (e.g. Christmas and Easter). 


State final demand 


Conceptually identical to domestic final demand at the national level (the sum of private and 
government final consumption expenditure and private and public gross fixed capital 
formation). 


National estimates are based on the concepts and conventions embodied in the System of 
National Accounts, 1993, but for regional (including state) estimates there is no separate 
international standard. Although national concepts are generally applicable to state 
accounts, there remain several conceptual and measurement issues that either do not apply 
or are insignificant nationally. Most of the problems arise in the measurement of gross state 
product for the transport and storage, communication services, and finance and insurance 
industries, where production often takes place across state borders. In these cases, a 
number of conceptual views can be applied to the allocation of value added by state. For 
more information, see chapter 28 of Australian System of National Accounts: Concepts, 
Sources and Methods (cat. no. 5216.0). 


Trend estimates 


Smoothing seasonally adjusted series produces a measure of trend by removing the impact 
of the irregular component of the series. The trend estimates are derived by applying a 13- 
term Henderson weighted moving average to the respective seasonally adjusted series. 
Readers are reminded that trend estimates are subject to revision as subsequent months' 
data become available. 


Unemployed 
Persons aged 15 years and over who were not employed during the reference week, and: 


» had actively looked for full-time or part-time work at any time in the four weeks up to 
the end of the reference week and: 
e were available for work in the reference week; 
e were waiting to start a new job within four weeks from the end of the 
reference week, and could have started in the reference week if the job had 
been available then.
