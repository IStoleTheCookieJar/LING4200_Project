It is predicted that the Tasmanian State Government will return a surplus of 
$28 million in the 1995~96 financial year. This follows a surplus of $35 million 
in 1994-95 (preliminary), and deficits in the three prior years. 


In terms of the component sectors, general government is expected to be in 
surplus by $39 million in 1995-96, which would represent the third 
consecutive year that a surplus has been achieved. The preliminary statistics 
for 1994-95 reveal a surplus of $55 million. The reduction in the surplus for 
the current year is primarily attributable to anticipated increases in final 
consumption expenditure and interest payments, in addition to decreased 
interest receipts. 


Public trading enterprises (PTEs) are also expected to return a surplus in 
1995-96, the estimate of which is $37 million. This also represents a-decrease 
from the surplus of the previous year, preliminary statistics showing a surplus 
of $94 million for 1994-95. Estimates for the current year indicate large 
increases in expenditure on both new and secondhand fixed assets by PTEs. 
This, together with a modest predicted rise in revenues, is expected to 
substantially reduce the surplus position of the PTE sector. 


Note: in GES, the deficitisurplus measure is not additive across sectors.

recorded by the Municipality of Meander Valley with 26, followed by the 
Municipality of Kingborough with 25, the City of Hobart with 24 and the City of

has been in decline for the last three months. 


The trend estimate of turnover for September 1995, for Australia ($9,924.8 
million), was almost 8% higher than for September 1994 ($9,191.0 million). The 
trend estimate of retail turnover increased by 0.5% in Seprember 1995, the 
lowest monthly increase since January 1995.

Tasmania, was $222.3 million, 0.4% below the figure recorded for September 
1994 ($223.2 million).

1994 (1,247).

EXPLANATORY NOTES 


INTRODUCTION 


SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT AND 
TREND ESTIMATION 


RELATED PUBLICATIONS 


_ UNPUBLISHED STATISTICS 


EFFECTS OF ROUNDING 


SYMBOLS AND OTHER USAGES 


1 This publication contains latest figuresfor a comprehensive range of 
economic indicators. Statistics shown in this publication are the latest 
available at the date of preparation and may be subject to revision in 
subsequent issues. In a number of cases figures appearing in this publication 
are preliminary and are subject to revision in subsequent issues. Reference 
should therefore always be made to the latest issue or to the statistical 
publication on the specific subject. 


2 Seasonal adjustment is a means of removing the estimated effects of 
normal seasonal variation from the series so that the effects of other 
influences on the series can be more clearly recognised, Seasonal adjustment 
does not aim to remove the irregular or non-seasonal influences which may 
be present in any particular month. This means that msonth-to-month 
movements of the seasonally adjusted estimates may not be reliable 
indicators of trend behaviour. 


% The smoothing of seasonally adjusted series reduces the impact of the 
irregular components of the seasonally adjusted series and creates trend 
estimates. These trend estimates are derived by applying a 13-term 
Hendersen-weighted moving average to all months except the last six. The 
last six monthly trend estimates are obtained by applying surrogates of the 
Henderson average to the seasonally adjusted series. Trend series are used 
to analyse the underlying behaviour of the series over time. 


4 While this smoothing technique enables estimates to be produced for the 
latest month, it does result in revisions to the most recent months as 
additional observations become available. Generally, subsequent revisions 
become smaller and after 3 months have a negligible impact on the series. 
Revisions also occur as a result of the annual review of seasonal factors. 


5 Users may wish to refer to the ABS Publication A Guide to Interpreting 
Time Series - Monitoring ‘Trends’ —An Overview (1348.0) for more 
detailed information on smoothing seasonally adjusted time series data.
