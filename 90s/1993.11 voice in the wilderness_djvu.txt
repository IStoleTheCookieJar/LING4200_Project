‘Friday night 12th Nov. . ane ercinitia 
1993. Set in the beauty 
| of the Numinbah Valley 
| at Camp Bornhoffen this 
‘| retreat is a reasonably 
priced getaway for the 
weekend. 
The retreats are an event 
most people try not to 
miss. They raise 
-oppurtunities for new and 
| renewed friendships. 
This retreat's theme is 


watching a 
butterfly flitting | 
overhead. 
| After some time, one 
catepillar said to the . 
other, "You wouldn't 
get me up In one of 
-| those things fora 
million dollars!" | 
Of course, the 
unsuspecting. little 
caterpillar was unaware 
that he was gazing on 
his own destiny.

| WHY NOT HAVE. 
A COFFEE WITH 
_ FRIENDS AFTER 
- THE ENGLISH 
LITURGY ! 


fe don't just 
= dash off’ after’ the 
; English Liturgy. If. 
you've got time why 

not come and have a coffee 
after the Liturgy. After every 
Liturgy on Saturday evening 
(6.30 - 7.30 pm) tea and 
coffee is served in the Respite 


Centre for the congregation. 


This provides an opportunity 
for us all to socialise and get 
to know one another. Already 
have been many 
friendships sparked from this | 
regular meeting place. If you 
can spare some time after the 
Liturgy, please stop in for a 
chat. We would love to see 
you there some time !
