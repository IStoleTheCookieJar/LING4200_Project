BIOTECHNOLOGY  AND  FORESTRY:  BREAKING  NEW  GROUND 

Even  though  they  came  from  16  countries,  spoke  many  languages  and 
worked  in  numerous  disciplines  and  subdisciplines,  all  had  one 
thing  in  common:  They  were  applying  the  tools  of  biotechnology  to 
forestry  research.  The  occasion  was  an  international  conference 
entitled  "Applications  of  Biotechnology  to  Tree  Culture, 
Protection,  and  Utilization"  sponsored  by  the  Forest  Service's 
Northeastern  Forest  Experiment  Station,  August  5-8,  in  Columbus, 
Ohio.  Tree  growth,  tree  protection,  and  tree  utilization  were  the 
main  areas  of  discussion. 

The  keynote  address  was  presented  by  Ellis  Cowling,  University 
Prof essor-at-Large  at  North  Carolina  State  University.  Cowling 
praised  two  recent  reports  of  the  National  Research  Council  which 
call  for  an  expansion  of  biotechnology  research  in  forestry  and  an 
increase  in  funding. 

Lois  Miller  of  the  University  of  Georgia  described  her  work 
deleting  an  ecdysteroid  transferase  gene  from  an  insect  virus.  She 
said  insects  infected  by  the  virus,  such  as  the  cabbage  looper,  die 
earlier  than  those  infected  with  the  wild  type  virus  containing  the 
gene . 

Roberta  Farrell  of  Repligen  Sandoz  Research  Corporation  described 
a process  that  uses  a fungus  to  pretreat  wood  chips  before  they  are 
processed  for  paper  and  pulp  production.  The  fungus  helps  to 
control  pitch  and  resin  acid  problems  and  offers  a biological 
alternative  to  the  use  of  chemicals.  Copies  of  all  the  research 
papers  presented  at  the  conference  are  available  by  calling  Rhonda 
Cobourn  at  614-369-4476. 


SPRECHEN  SIE  DEUTSCH? 

If  not,  don't  worry:  English  will  be  the  official  language  spoken 
at  the  upcoming  BIOTECHNICA  Hannover  '91  International  Congress  and 


Exhibition  for  Biotechnology,  held  in  Hannover,  Germany,  October 
22-24.  This  year  one  of  the  keynote  speakers  will  be  Harry 
Mussman,  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary,  Science  and  Education,  who 
will  discuss  USDA's  research,  regulatory,  and  educational 
activities  in  agricultural  biotechnology.  USDA  has  been  invited  to 
be  an  exhibitor  at  the  USA  Pavilion,  and  the  Office  of  Agricultural 
Biotechnology  (OAB)  will  coordinate  this  effort.  The  conference 
draws  upwards  of  8,000  international  visitors  and  450  exhibitors 
from  21  countries. 


VETERINARY  BIOLOGICS:  BETTER  PRODUCTS  THROUGH  BIOTECHNOLOGY 

Plants,  microbes,  and  animals  aren't  the  only  beneficiaries  of 
biotechnology:  new  and  better  veterinary  biological  products,  such 
as  diagnostic  test  kits,  vaccines,  and  toxins,  are  also  being 
developed  using  monoclonal  antibody  technology  and  recombinant  DNA 
techniques.  The  result  is  biologicals  that  give  faster  diagnoses, 
are  highly  specific,  and  produce  very  accurate  results. 

All  veterinary  biological  products  are  regulated  under  the  Virus- 
Serum-Toxin  Act  by  USDA's  Animal  and  Plant  Health  Inspection 
Service  (APHIS),  Biotechnology,  Biologies,  and  Environmental 
Protection  Division,  to  be  sure  they  are  safe,  pure,  potent,  and 
efficacious.  More  than  45  have  been  licensed  by  APHIS  and  are 
being  used  today  by  veterinary  practitioners  around  the  world. 

Because  the  technology  for  producing  these  products  is  constantly 
evolving,  as  well  as  the  Federal  regulations  which  are  based  on  the 
technology,  APHIS  gets  together  each  year  in  Ames,  Iowa  with  the 
producers,  users,  and  other  interested  persons  to  share  information 
and  discuss  any  concerns.  At  this  year's  national  public  meeting, 
held  August  15-16,  the  topics  of  most  interest  to  the  attendees 
included  international  harmonization  initiatives,  in-vitro  potency 
testing,  post-licensing  monitoring  of  biological  products,  a 
reproposed  rule  on  autogenous  biologies,  and  an  update  on  products 
produced  through  biotechnology. 

More  than  200  people  attended  the  meeting  with  participants 
agreeing  that  such  meetings  are  very  worthwhile  and  should 
continue.  For  more  information  about  APHIS'S  veterinary  biologies 
program,  please  call  its  Deputy  Director,  David  Espeseth,  at  301- 
436-8245. 


PROBE:  ALL  ABOUT  PLANT  GENOME  MAPPING 

The  National  Agricultural  Library's  Plant  Genome  Information  Center 
recently  published  the  first  issue  of  a well  written,  attractive 
quarterly  publication  entitled  Probe,  It  includes  a wide  variety 
of  articles  related  to  plant  genome  mapping  as  well  as  a section  on 


-2- 


and  may  be  ordered  by  sending  a four-line  name  and  address  to  Plant 
Genome  Data  and  Information  Center,  USDA-NAL,  10301  Baltimore 
Blvd.,  Beltsville,  MD  20705-2351,  or  call  301-344-3875.  The  FAX 
number  is  301-344-6098. 


NEW  VIDEOTAPE  AVAILABLE 

The  North  Carolina  Biotechnology  Center  and  CIBA-Geigy  Corp.  have 
produced  a new  videotape  on  genetically  modified  tobacco  plants 
entitled  Biotechnology:  Sowing  the  Seeds  for  Better  Agriculture. 
It  introduces  the  lay  audience  to  the  science  and  applications  of 
ag  biotechnology  using  CIBA-Geigy' s tobacco  field  test  as  a case 
study.  The  video  is  15  minutes  long  and  copies  are  free  to  North 
Carolina  ag  extension  service  offices  as  well  as  North  Carolina 
teachers.  If  you  don't  fall  into  either  of  these  categories,  you 
may  either  borrow  the  tape  at  no  charge  or  purchase  it  for  $20. 
For  more  details  please  call  Corinthia  Scurlock  at  919-541-9366. 


FISHING  FOR  ANSWERS 

Any  listing  of  animal  diseases  should  also  include  those  pathogens 
that  infect  fish.  There  are  many  different  diseases  that  can 
affect  a wide  variety  of  species  under  the  right  circumstances. 
But  those  of  trout  and  salmon  are  of  special  interest  to  scientists 
because  of  past  disease  outbreaks. 

In  an  effort  to  share  ideas  and  exchange  technical  information 
about  applying  the  techniques  of  biotechnology  to  aquaculture 
diseases,  John  Fryer  and  Jo-Ann  Leong  from  Oregon  State  University 
recently  visited  leading  scientists  from  BioResearch  Ireland. 

The  research  centers  in  Ireland  have  an  active  biotechnology 
program  in  aquaculture  and  have  been  successful  in  developing 
vaccines  for  salmon  and  trout,  developing  DNA  probes,  and  studying 
proliferative  kidney  disease  in  rainbow  trout.  It  is  anticipated 
that  this  initial  meeting  will  lead  to  a workshop  next  year  in 
Ireland  composed  of  U.S.  and  Irish  scientists  who  share  common 
research  interests  in  aquaculture  biotechnology. 


NEWS  AROUND  THE  NATION  (AND  THE  WORLD) 


BYE  BYE  BANGS 

Experiments  with  a genetically  modified  vaccine  for  the  cattle 
disease  brucellosis  (also  known  as  Bang's)  will  begin  this  month  at 
Texas  A&M  University,  College  Station,  Texas.  Brucellosis  is  a 


-3- 


contagious  disease  which  causes  cows  to  abort  their  fetuses  and  can 
cause  undulent  fever  in  humans.  More  than  seven  hundred  herds  in 
20  states  have  the  disease.  The  Federal  government  spends  about 
$60  million  a year  in  eradication  efforts. 

Researchers  have  developed  a vaccine  that  can  be  easily 
differentiated  from  the  current  Strain  19  vaccine,  for  which  it  is 
difficult  to  distinguish  between  cows  naturally  infected  with  the 
disease  and  those  with  elevated  antibody  counts  due  to  vaccination 
with  Strain  19.  Twenty-five  cows  will  be  inoculated  with  the 
attenuated  (weakened)  Brucella  abortus  microorganism,  the  strain  of 
bacteria  which  causes  brucellosis.  Another  25  cows  will  be  given 
Strain  19  as  positive  controls,  and  a third  group  will  be 
uninoculated  negative  controls. 

The  project  has  been  reviewed  and  approved  by  USDA's  Agricultural 
Biotechnology  Research  Advisory  Committee,  APHIS,  and  the  Texas 
Animal  Health  Commission.  This  phase  of  the  experiment  will 
conclude  after  one  year.

A FOOT  IN  THE  DOOR 

Texas  A&M  University  is  helping  minority  high  school  students  learn 
what  research  is  really  like  through  two  outreach  programs.  Each 
summer  almost  70  high  school  students  are  recruited  to  work  in 
laboratories  and  get  paid  for  it.  Students  may  either  enroll  in 
the  Minority  High  School  Science  Research  Apprentice  Program,  which 
focuses  on  the  life  sciences,  or  in  the  Kiki  de  la  Garza  Minority 
Apprenticeship  program,  which  enables  the  students  to  work  in 


-4- 


experiment  station  laboratories  around  the  state.  Supervisors 
serve  as  mentors  and  recruiters  for  the  University.  For  more 
information  about  the  program,  call  Steve  Hill  at  409-845-6717. 


CALGENE  SEEKS  FDA  ADVISORY  OPINION 

Calgene  of  Davis,  CA  has  asked  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration 
(FDA)  to  issue  an  Advisory  Opinion  confirming  the  status  of  its 
genetically  engineered  tomato  as  food.  Called  FLAVR  SAVR™,  the 
tomato  has  an  antisense  gene  that  delays  softening  for  an  extended 
period  of  time,  thus  increasing  the  shelf  life  of  the  fruit.  Also, 
Calgene  says  the  tomatoes  taste  better  because  they  are  picked  when 
they  are  vine-ripe  instead  of  green.  Four  years  of  field  testing 
preceded  the  FDA  request.  Calgene  has  an  exclusive  license  to  use 
the  antisense  gene  for  fresh  market  tomatoes  in  North  America, 
while  Campbell  owns  the  right  to  use  the  gene  in  processing 
tomatoes.  For  more  details,  call  Daniel  Wagster  at  Calgene  at  916- 
753-6313.
