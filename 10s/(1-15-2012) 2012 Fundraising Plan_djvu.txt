1.  Overview 


We  plan  to  raise  $7.7  million  in  2012,  approximately  70  percent  more  than  the  amount  raised  in 
2011.  Table  1  reports  2011  actual  and  2012  projected  and  calculates  the  percentage  increase  in 
each  category  of  income.

The  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  requires  that  we  track  income  by  the  categories  that  appear 
in  Table  1,  and  this  is  how  Heartland's  accounting  system  reports  receipts.  However,  for 
fundraising  planning  purposes,  it  is  more  reliable  to  project  gifts  by  renewals,  first-time  givers, 
and  direct  mail.  Table  2  below  sorts  the  2012  budget  and  201 1  actual  figures  by  the  categories 
that  will  be  used  in  the  rest  of  this  Fundraising  Plan.

2.  Department  Personnel 


Implementation  of  the  fundraising  plan  in  2012  will  be  affected  by  the  following  changes  in 
personnel: 

■  Joseph  Bast,  president  of  The  Heartland  Institute,  has  been  Heartland's  principal  fundraiser 
throughout  its  history  and  expects  to  continue  to  raise  the  bulk  of  funds  in  2012.  However, 
we  are  making  progress  in  getting  others  to  help  raise  funds,  as  the  rest  of  this  section 
suggests. 

■  In  July  201 1,  Amanda  Evans  was  hired  as  director  of  development  and  is  managing  major 
individual  donors,  foundation  relations,  and  planned  giving,  and  well  as  overseeing  the 
following  department  staff: 

Gwen  Bryant,  membership  manager 

Rachel  Rivest  Dunbar,  corporate  relations  manager 

John  Griswold,  direct  mail  consultant 

■  Heartland  added  Sam  Schulman  to  the  department  in  March  201 1  as  an  independent 
contractor  and  fundraising  senior  advisor.  Sam  is  highly  connected  in  conservative  social 
circles  and  made  many  contacts  on  our  behalf,  but  succeeded  in  raising  only  one  gift  for 
$10,000.  We  allowed  our  agreement  to  expire  in  201 1,  but  are  paying  him  a  small  amount  in 
early  2011  to  follow-up  and  close  on  some  prospects. 

■  Bruno  Behrend,  hired  in  January  2010  to  fundraise  on  school  reform,  was  unsuccessful  in 
doing  so  in  201 1.  He  was  moved  to  part-time  and  then  to  volunteer  status  by  the  end  of  the 
year.  He  continues  to  speak  at  public  events  and  talk  to  donors,  but  we  do  not  expect  him  to 
be  sufficiently  successful  to  return  to  paid  status  in  2012. 

■  Eli  Lehrer,  director  of  Heartland's  Washington  DC  office  and  its  Center  on  Finance, 
Insurance,  and  Real  Estate,  is  responsible  for  raising  funds  sufficient  to  cover  the  entire  costs 
of  his  department.  He  achieved  that  in  both  2010  and  201 1. 

■  Vince  Galbiati  was  hired  in  January  201 1  to  direct  the  Free  To  Choose  Medicine  project. 
We  expect  him  to  be  intimately  involved  in  fundraising  efforts  for  the  project,  and  project  $1 
million  in  new  income  thanks  in  part  to  his  coming  on  board. 

■  Alan  Smith,  a  senior  fellow  on  finance  issues  and  director  of  Heartland's  Ohio  office,  is 
moving  from  part-time  to  nearly  full-time  capacity  in  2012.  He  reports  to  Eli  Lehrer,  who 
says  fundraising  will  be  part  of  Alan's  new  responsibilities.  Alan  is  the  former  executive 
director  of  the  American  Legislative  Exchange  Council  (ALEC)  and  has  extensive  contacts 
in  the  corporate  government  relations  world.

3.  Fundraising  Strategy  and  Tactics 


The  Heartland  Institute  has  a  comprehensive  fundraising  program  with  strategies  and  tactics  that 
can  be  categorized  as  follows: 

1.  Current  donor  renewal 

2.  New  donor  identification  and  solicitation 

3.  Donor  events 

4.  Online  fundraising 

5.  Direct  mail 

6.  Major  project  fundraising 

7.  Planned  giving 


1.  Current  Donor  Renewal 

Approximately  80%  of  Heartland's  income  each  year  historically  has  come  from  past  donors 
who  renew  at  their  current  level  or  increase  their  giving.  Donors  are  most  likely  to  renew  if  they 
are  promptly  thanked  for  every  gift  they  make,  and  frequently  contacted  by  Heartland  staff  with 
news  about  the  institute's  programs  and  giving  opportunities  and  asked  to  give.  Therefore, 

■  We  track  all  gifts  that  are  received  using  Paradox,  an  inter-relational  database  program  that 
also  controls  who  receives  publications. 

■  We  send  thank  you  letters  within  7  days  of  a  gift  being  received,  with  those  letters 
customized  and  signed  by  the  President. 

■  We  track  contacts  with  donors  and  potential  donors  of  $500+  using  ACT!,  a  sales 
management  software  program. 

■  We  send  a  weekly  donor  newsletter  by  email  to  all  donors  for  whom  we  have  email 
addresses,  featuring  our  biggest  achievements,  invitations  to  events,  and  opportunities  to 
contribute. 

■  We  send  a  colorful  quarterly  newsletter  by  mail,  QPR  (formerly  The  Heartlander)  to  all 
donors  of  $50+. 

■  We  send  much  longer  and  more  detailed  Quarterly  Progress  Reports  by  email  or  regular 
mail  to  donors  of  $1,000  or  more.  These  reports  are  designed  to  meet  the  reporting 
requirements  of  the  most  rigorous  corporate  and  foundation  donors.  Six  QPRs  are  produced 
each  quarter,  each  summarizing  our  outputs  on  one  of  the  six  topic  areas  that  Heartland 
addresses.  Donors  are  coded  by  what  topics  they  are  most  interested  in  or  which  QPRs  they 
have  requested. 


-4- 


■  We  maintain  a  Development  Progress  Report  that  tracks  what  gifts  have  come  in,  which  are 
pledged,  and  which  need  to  be  secured  in  each  quarter.  That  report  is  continuously  updated 
and  acts  as  the  "to  do  list"  for  the  department. 

■  We  maintain  calendars  of  renewal  dates  and  deadlines  for  corporate  and  foundation  donors. 

■  A  first  renewal  letter  is  automatically  generated  three  months  prior  to  the  one  year 
"anniversary"  of  a  donor's  last  gift.  If  the  donor  doesn't  renew,  another  letter  is  sent  a  month 
later,  and  a  third  letter  is  sent  two  months  later.  Those  letters  are  updated  once  a  quarter. 

■  Major  donors  are  usually  approached  before  their  renewal  date  by  phone  or  email  to  discuss 
their  interests,  schedule  a  face-to-face  meeting  if  possible,  and  solicit  an  increase  in  their 
support.  Smaller  donors  may  only  be  asked  to  renew  via  the  renewal  letters. 

■  "Expired  donors"  going  back  three  years  get  invitations  to  some  events  and  end  of  the  year 
solicitations  to  give.  Notes  about  major  past  donors  stay  in  ACT  for  five  years  or  longer. 

■  Heartland  has  an  anonymous  donor  who  has  given  as  much  as  half  the  organizations'  entire 
budget  in  some  past  years,  and  currently  gives  about  one-fifth  of  total  receipts.  Renewing 
him  each  year  and  keeping  him  informed  and  engaged  is  a  major  responsibility  of  the 
President.  We  regularly  solicite  his  ideas  for  new  projects, 

■  We  continuously  conduct  research  on  current  donors,  even  small  donors,  to  discover  people 
with  high  net  worth  or  positions  on  foundation  boards  who  we  might  be  able  to  up-sell.  That 
information  is  put  into  the  ACT!  database  so  that  all  fundraisers  can  see  what  information  we 
have  about  donors  when  placing  calls. 

Some  highlights  of  planned  renewal  efforts  in  2012  include  the  following: 

■  We  plan  to  significantly  increase  the  amount  of  development  staff  travel,  meeting  especially 
with  corporate  and  foundation  donors  who  we  did  not  see  in  201 1. 

■  In  201 1,  we  failed  to  properly  track  corporate  and  foundation  donors  renewals,  with  the 
result  that  we  failed  to  ask  for  renewed  support  earlier  enough,  or  in  some  cases  even  at  all. 
In  2012  we  plan  to  more  carefully  monitor  the  calendars  of  renewal  dates  and  deadlines  and 
the  Weekly  Progress  Report,  and  hold  one  another  accountable  for  making  the  necessary 
contacts. 

■  We  expect  to  have  interns  to  help  do  background  research  on  current  and  new  donors.  With  a 
much-expanded  direct  mail  campaign  planned  (see  below),  we  believe  a  full-time  person 
could  be  kept  busy  simply  researching  new  donors,  coding  them  in  Paradox  and  ACT!  to 
reflect  their  interests,  and  calling  or  sending  follow-up  proposals  to  those  who  show  the 
greatest  ability  to  increase  their  financial  support. 


-5- 


■  We  are  more  actively  seeking  opportunities  to  set  up  matching  gift  situations  using  current 
donors'  support,  in  particular  the  Anonymous  Donor  and  Bart  Madden' s  support  for  the 
FTCM  project. 


2.  New  Donor  Identification  and  Solicitation 

Successful  fundraising  programs  are  sometimes  characterized  as  resembling  a  funnel,  with  a 
wide  top  and  narrow  bottom  or  shoot.  The  wide  top  represents  reaching  a  large  number  of 
potential  donors,  and  the  narrow  bottom  is  the  actual  number  of  donors  that  will  result  from  that 
outreach.  Heartland  needs  to  identify  about  10  potential  donors  for  every  actual  gift  we  receive. 


Table  3  describes  four  categories  of  potential  donors  we  regularly  search  for  prospects,  where  we 
get  the  names  of  prospects,  and  how  we  make  solicitations.  This  is  primarily  for  major  donors 
(gifts  of  $1,000  or  more).

During  2012  we  will  be  utilizing  all  of  these  solicitation  methods.  Some  highlights: 


■  A  new  development  committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  has  been  created  and  had  its  first 
conference  call.  We  expect  to  get  names  and  contact  information  for  dozens,  and  possibly 
many  more,  potential  donors,  and  help  reaching  them. 

■  We  will  do  concerted  outreach  to  individuals  in  Chicago's  financial  community  (thanks  to 
the  location  of  our  new  office),  and  businesses  with  financial  interests  in  hydraulic  fracturing 
("fracking"),  cable  and  internet  tax  and  regulation  issues  (with  Mike  Rose  at  ComCast), 
bringing  new  prescription  drugs  to  market,  and  P&C  insurance  issues. 

■  We  will  continue  to  follow  up  and  try  to  close  on  the  lists  of  major  potential  donors  that  Sam 
Schulman  and  Bruno  Behrend  created  during  his  time  with  Heartland. 

■  We  will  pursue  lists  of  supporters  of  charter  schools  to  support  our  work  on  school  reform. 

■  The  Charles  G.  Koch  Foundation  returned  as  a  Heartland  donor  in  201 1.  We  expect  to  ramp 
up  their  level  of  support  in  2012  and  gain  access  to  the  network  of  philanthropists  they  work 
with. 

■  We  plan  to  identify  and  re-introduce  ourselves  to  the  20  top  foundations  supporting 


-7- 


conservative  and  libertarian  organizations  in  the  country.  In  many  cases,  we  have  changed 
dramatically  since  the  last  time  they  contributed,  and  many  foundations  weren't  even  around 
when  we  first  put  together  our  list  of  foundation  prospects.  We  will  get  on  the  radar  of 
foundation  staff  as  well  as  founders/chairmen  and  members  of  foundation  boards  by 
partnering  with  their  favorite  charities,  attending  events  they  are  likely  to  attend,  etc. 

■  We  have  not  tried  to  "crowd  source"  for  individual  prospects  before,  and  believe  this  will 
generate  many  excellent  individual  prospects.  As  Heartland  has  grown,  it  has  added  to  its 
staff  persons  with  extensive  personal  networks  in  the  conservative  and  libertarian 
movements.  We  have  not  previously  tried  to  tap  them,  relying  instead  of  the  shrinking  and 
aging  network  of  Heartland's  president. 

■  We  have  a  new  "Who  We  Are"  document  that  complements  our  "Prospectus"  and  should 
help  us  more  quickly  establish  our  identity  and  credibility  with  prospects. 


3.  Donor  Events 

Face-to-face  meetings  often  are  necessary  to  get  larger  gifts.  They  can  occur  either  one-on-one, 
in  a  donor  or  prospect's  home  or  office,  or  in  a  group  situation.  We  pursue  both.  Group  meetings 
can  be: 

■  Hosted  by  Heartland  specifically  for  Heartland  donors  (such  as  our  anniversary  benefit 
dinners  or  President' s  Council  Retreats)  or  for  elected  officials  and  other  audiences  at  which 
Heartland  development  staff  can  make  presentations  and  connections  with  donors  and 
prospects. 

■  Hosted  by  allies  or  business  and  civic  groups,  in  which  case  Heartland  is  a  cosponsor, 
exhibitor,  presenter,  or  just  sends  people  to  attend. 

Table  4  shows  the  2012  budget  for  events  and  consponsoring/exhibiting.  We  have  budgeted  a 
record  $380,000  for  these  activities.

Some  highlights  from  events  planned  for  2012: 

■  Our  new  office  has  room  to  host  lunches  and  receptions  for  up  to  50  or  60  people.  We  plan  to 
take  advantage  of  this  by  hosting  many  lunches  and  after  work  receptions.  By  providing  our 
own  food  and  alcohol  (some  of  both  will  be  donated),  the  cost  per  person  should  be  much 
less  than  we  paid  to  hold  events  at  restaurants  and  hotels  in  the  past. 

■  This  year's  President's  Council  Retreat  will  tentatively  be  shorter  (just  one  day)  and  focus  on 
a  truly  exceptional  meal  and  plenty  of  reception  time  to  mingle  with  and  get  to  know 
celebrity  guests. 

■  This  year's  anniversary  benefit  will  once  again  take  place  on  the  same  day  as  the  Emerging 
Issues  Forum,  in  order  to  get  legislators  to  attend  both  events  and  create  opportunities  for 
donors  to  mingle  with  legislators.  Both  events  will  take  place  in  early  August,  rather  than  our 
usual  time  in  October,  to  piggyback  on  an  annual  meeting  of  NCSL  taking  place  in  Chicago. 

■  We  have  tried  in  the  past  to  host  half-day  (or  shorter)  programs  in  state  capitals,  with  mixed 
success.  We  plan  for  eight  such  events  in  2012,  with  some  of  them  perhaps  using  Cook 
County  Treasurer  Maria  Pappas  as  a  draw. 

■  The  new  Free  To  Choose  Medicine  project  is  budgeted  at  $3,000  a  month  to  register  and 
exhibit  at  events  hosted  by  other  organizations.  There  are  many  patient  advocacy  groups  and 
prescription  drug  business  associations  that  host  many  events  every  year,  we  hope  to  have  a 
presence  at  some  of  them. 

4.  Online  fundraising 

For  the  first  time  in  201 1,  we  devoted  significant  resources  to  using  the  Internet  to  fundraise.  We 
previously  used  email  for  invitations  and  had  a  somewhat  typical/sober  place  on  our  Web  site  to 
contribute.  With  a  complete  redesign  of  our  Web  presence  in  201 1,  we  added  ads  and  requests 
for  contributions  to  the  homepage  and  created  a  much  expanded  and  more  exciting  "donate" 
feature. 

We  launched  a  weekly  donor  e-newsletter  in  201 1  highlighting  our  biggest  achievements  in  the 
previous  week.  Each  e-newsletter  contains  promotional  language  requesting  contributions.  We 
are  steadily  expanding  the  list  of  people  receiving  the  newsletter  to  include  potential  as  well  as 
actual  donors. 

Donating  online  was  made  easier  in  201 1  by  our  use  of  Kimbia,  an  online  donation  and 
reservation  processing  system  that  is  easy  to  use,  secure,  allows  us  to  receive  funds  immediately, 
keeps  donors  on  our  Web  page,  and  is  fully  automated.

5.  Direct  mail 


Heartland  mails  frequently  to  its  house  list  of  donors,  prospects,  subscribers,  and  allies.  Direct 
mail  (DM),  however,  is  properly  understood  as  mailing  to  rented  lists  of  potential  donors. 

Heartland  has  seldom  used  DM  to  raise  money.  In  the  past,  it  has  produced  mailings  of  1,000  - 
3,000  pieces  in-house,  mailing  to  lists  it  got  from  other  free-market  groups  through  list 
exchanges.  These  mailings  invariably  made  money,  not  counting  staff  time,  but  the  scale  was  too 
small  to  contribute  much  to  the  organization's  bottom- line.  Because  the  list  exchanges  were 
limited  to  the  number  of  donors  Heartland  has,  they  could  not  be  scaled  up. 

In  late  2011,  Heartland  negotiated  an  agreement  with  Griswold  and  Griswold,  a  DM  consulting 
firm,  to  produce  approximately  1  million  DM  letters  in  2012.  Griswold  will  manage  the  writing, 
printing  and  mailing  of  the  letters  and  "caging"  the  returns,  and  pass  through  to  us  bills  from 
vendors.  Because  of  some  delay  in  getting  started,  we  expect  the  actual  number  of  letters  to  be 
sent  in  2012  will  be  800,000. 

According  to  Griswold' s  plan,  the  cost  for  a  million  letters  would  be  about  $542,000  and  gross 
income  is  forecast  to  be  $508,000,  for  a  net  loss  in  the  first  year  of  about  $34,000.  We  have  put 
80%  of  those  numbers  into  the  budget  for  2012,  to  account  for  the  smaller  number  of  letters  to  be 
mailed,  and  divided  the  total  expense  between  Griswold' s  fee  ($0.555/letter)  and  printing  and 
mailing. 

If  Griswold's  plan  is  correct,  Heartland  should  end  2012  with  approximately  18,000  new  donors. 
We  currently  have  only  1,800  donors,  so  this  would  be  quite  an  accomplishment.  Griswold 
further  forecasts  that  Heartland  would  net  $500,000  in  the  second  year  of  the  campaign,  and 
would  end  2013  with  some  33,000  donors. 


6.  Major  Project  Fundraising 

While  ideologically  motivated  individual  donors  are  apt  to  contribute  for  general  operating, 
corporations  and  (increasingly)  foundations  want  project- specific  proposals.  We  try  as  best  we 
can  to  tailor  our  programs  to  meet  both  the  requirements  of  our  mission  -  to  discover,  develop, 
and  promote  free-market  solutions  to  social  and  economic  problems  -  while  also  exciting  new 
donors  to  make  the  contributions  needed  to  fund  our  programs. 

During  2012  we  plan  to  fundraise  for  10  new  or  relaunched  projects  designed  to  attract  new 
donors.  These  are  in  addition  to  proposals  for  our  six  public  policy  newspapers,  work  on  health 
care  and  telecommunications,  and  other  ongoing  projects  that  we  expect  will  appeal  primarily  to 
existing  donors.  The  projects  are  briefly  described  here  and  ordered  by  the  size  of  their  budgets, 
from  largest  to  smallest.  A  summary  appears  in  Table  12  later  in  this  fundraising  plan. 


-12- 


A.  Free  To  Choose  Medicine  Project 

Free  To  Choose  Medicine  (FTCM)  is  a  new  project  of  The  Heartland  Institute.  During  201 1, 
Heartland's  president  Joseph  Bast  wrote  an  80-page  proposal  for  the  effort,  and  donor  Bart 
Madden  agreed  to  contribute  half  of  the  project's  $1  million/year  budget.  In  January,  a  director 
for  the  project,  Vince  Galbriati,  was  hired. 

We  expect  the  FTCM  to  bring  in  at  least  $1  million  in  gifts  from  all  donors,  including  Bart 
Madden.  Approximately  $500,000  in  gifts  will  be  from  first-time  donors.  There  are  scores  of 
businesses  and  trade  associations  with  a  keen  interest  in  our  effort,  and  many  wealthy  individuals 
have  strong  personal  motivation  to  see  faster  access  to  potentially  life-saving  new  drugs  become 
a  reality.  Vince  Galbriati  is  eager  to  "pitch"  the  proposal  to  investors  in  drug  companies.  Several 
current  Heartland  donors  are  already  donating  to  the  project,  and  will  give  more  if  they  see 
progress  being  made. 

B.  Nongovernmental  International  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (NIPCC) 

Heartland  sponsors  the  Nongovernmental  International  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (NIPCC),  an 
international  network  of  scientists  who  write  and  speak  out  on  climate  change.  Heartland  pays  a 
team  of  scientists  approximately  $300,000  a  year  to  work  on  a  series  of  editions  of  Climate 
Change  Reconsidered,  the  most  comprehensive  and  authoritative  rebuttal  of  the  United  Nations' 
IPCC  reports.  Another  $88,000  is  earmarked  for  Heartland  staff,  incremental  expenses,  and 
overhead  for  editing,  expense  reimbursement  for  the  authors,  and  marketing. 

NIPCC  is  currently  funded  by  two  gifts  a  year  from  two  foundations,  both  of  them  requesting 
anonymity.  In  2012  we  plan  to  solicit  gifts  from  other  donors  to  add  to  what  these  two  donors  are 
giving  in  order  to  cover  more  of  our  fixed  costs  for  promoting  the  first  two  Climate  Change 
Reconsidered  volumes  and  writing  and  editing  the  volume  scheduled  for  release  in  2013.  We 
hope  to  raise  $200,000  in  2012. 

C.  Operation  Angry  Badger 

Wisconsin  was  the  focus  of  national  attention  due  to  recall  campaigns  waged  in  201 1,  and 
campaigns  are  taking  place  in  2012  against  Gov.  Scott  Walker,  Lt.  Gov.  Rebecca  Kleefisch  and 
three  Republican  senators  who  voted  for  Act  10,  the  landmark  collective  bargaining  reform 
legislation  adopted  in  2011.  We  have  been  following  the  Wisconsin  debate  closely,  reporting  on 
it  in  Budget  &  Tax  News,  commenting  in  op-eds  and  LTEs  and  on  blogs,  doing  television  and 
radio  interviews,  and  sending  research  and  commentary  to  elected  officials  in  Wisconsin  and 
nationally. 

The  recall  elections  of  2012  amount  to  a  referenda  on  collective  bargaining  reform  at  the  state 
level,  making  them  of  national  interest.  Successful  recalls  would  be  a  major  setback  to  the 


-13- 


national  effort  to  rein  in  public  sector  compensation  and  union  power.  Heartland  is  the  largest 
and  most  influential  national  free-market  think  tank  in  the  Midwest,  so  we  are  in  the  right  place 
and  with  the  right  resources  to  help  defend  and  secure  Wisconsin's  recent  gains. 

We  are  contemplating  five  projects: 

1.  Recruit  and  promote  superintendents  who  support  Act  10 

2.  Explain  the  benefits  of  Act  10 

3.  Document  the  shortcomings  of  public  schools  in  Wisconsin 

4.  Expose  teacher  pay  in  key  districts 

5.  Create  blogs  that  shadow  small  town  newspaper  coverage  of  the  controversy 

We  anticipate  that  this  project  will  cost  about  $612,000.  Maureen  Martin,  Heartland's  legal 
counsel,  with  be  the  chief  researcher  and  writer  for  this  project.  The  anonymous  donor  has 
pledged  $100,000  toward  this  project.  We  are  circulating  a  proposal  to  other  potential  funders. 

D.  Center  for  Transforming  Education 

The  Center  for  Transforming  Education  at  The  Heartland  Institute  produces  School  Reform 
News,  leads  the  national  effort  to  implement  "Parent  Triggers"  at  the  state  level  outside 
California,  played  a  major  role  in  a  Texas  effort  in  2012  that  narrowly  lost,  and  conducts  a  full- 
scale  PR  and  GR  campaign  for  "transformational"  school  reform. 

Funding  for  this  Center  has  lagged  well  behind  past  levels  during  the  past  two  years,  as  we 
hoped  Bruno  Behrend  would  renew  current  donors  and  identify  new  potential  donors.  That 
didn't  work,  and  no  one  else  stepped  in  to  take  over  fundraising  until  it  was  too  late.  As  a  result, 
our  efforts  in  this  field  had  to  be  heavily  subsidized  from  the  general  operating  budget  in  201 1. 
This  year  should  see  a  substantial  jump  in  receipts  from  new  and  lapsed  donors  for  school  reform 
if  only  because  they  will  be  more  systematically  contacted  and  renewed  than  during  201 1. 

We  hope  to  schedule  meetings  with  the  leaders  of  the  largest  donors  and  foundations  active  in 
this  arena.  It  has  often  been  three  years  or  longer  since  they  met  with  a  Heartland  representative. 
But  we  won't  rely  entirely  on  them  changing  their  minds  about  how  important  Heartland  is  in  the 
school  reform  movement. 

We  plan  to  aggressively  pursue  donors  to  charter  schools.  Lists  of  such  donors  often  are  publicly 
available,  printed  in  the  newsletters  of  the  schools.  Charters  are  the  "safe"  kind  of  school  choice, 
and  supporters  often  contribute  large  amounts  toward  capital  campaigns  and  scholarships.  These 
individuals  are  ideal  candidates  to  contribute  to  a  think  tank  that  promises  to  remove  barriers  to 
starting  new  charter  schools  and  extending  choice  to  other  private  schools. 

The  2012  budget  for  the  Center  for  Transforming  Education  is  $250,000.

E.  Chicago  FIRE  Outreach 


Heartland  is  moving  to  new  office  space  in  January,  from  the  rather  shabby  and  difficult  to  find 
offices  on  LaSalle  Street  we  have  occupied  for  some  15  years,  dating  back  to  when  we  were  a 
much  smaller  organization.  The  new  office,  on  the  27th  floor  of  a  Helmut  Jahn-designed  glass 
and  steel  skyscraper  located  on  Wacker  Drive,  across  from  the  Chicago  Mercantile  Exchange, 
promises  to  dramatically  raise  our  profile  in  Chicago's  financial  community. 

We  plan  to  aggressively  market  ourselves  to  Chicago's  financial  community  by  hosting  frequent 
lunches  and  afterwork  receptions  in  our  offices,  and  meeting  with  potential  donors  in  the  office 
buildings  surrounding  our  new  location.  When  Heartland  was  founded  in  1984,  we  received 
funding  from  several  traders  at  the  Chicago  Board  of  Trade,  CBOT,  and  CME.  That  funding  has 
gradually  disappeared  as  traders  flamed  out  or  moved  on  to  other  interests.  Rather  than  try  to 
replace  them,  we  pursued  well-known  conservative  and  libertarian  philanthropists  largely 
outside  Illinois. 

The  financial  sector  has  obviously  boomed  during  the  years  since  Heartland  created  its  current 
donor  base.  There  are  thousands  of  affluent  hedge  fund  managers,  market  makers,  and  traders 
within  a  stone's  throw  of  Heartland's  new  office  who  are  libertarians  and  never  heard  of  us.  We 
hope  to  reach  them  in  a  variety  of  ways,  most  of  them  networking  based,  and  sign  them  up  to 
support  our  work  on  finance,  insurance,  and  real  estate  (FIRE). 

This  effort  is  largely  separate  from  Eli  Lehrer's  fundraising  efforts,  which  focus  on  a  small 
number  of  property  and  casualty  insurance  companies  outside  Chicago.  We  will  seek  to  tap  into 
the  fundamentally  libertarian  instincts  of  many  people  in  the  financial  world  to  support  FIRE 
Policy  News  and  potentially  other  projects  that  focus  on  non-insurance  topics  such  as  Dodd- 
Frank,  Sarbanes-Oxley,  federal  bail-outs  of  banks  and  other  businesses,  proposals  to  "tax  the 
rich,"  and  the  Federal  Reserve. 

We  hope  to  raise  $100,000  from  Chicago-based  donors  as  a  result  of  this  effort. 

F.  David  H.  Padden  Internship  Program 

David  Padden,  Heartland's  founder  and  long-time  chairman  and  then  chairman  emeritus,  passed 
away  on  October  2,  2011.  Various  ideas  have  been  discussed  to  memorialize  his  major 
contributions  to  Heartland  specifically  and  to  the  freedom  movement  more  generally.  One  thing 
we  plan  to  do  is  name  the  meeting  space  at  our  new  offices  after  Dave,  so  that  invitations  to 
events  will  include  his  name  and  help  keep  his  memory  alive. 

Another  way  to  memorialize  Dave's  contributions  could  be  to  establish  the  David  H.  Padden 
Internship  Program.  The  rationale  is  as  follows: 

■   Of  the  many  groups  Dave  supported,  Cato  and  The  Heartland  Institute  stand  out.  Dave 


-15- 


stepped  down  from  all  other  boards  in  his  latter  years  except  Heartland.  Even  folks  at  Cato 
say  Dave  was  most  proud  of  what  he  had  achieved  with  Heartland. 

■  Of  the  many  different  audiences  he  thought  libertarians  should  reach,  young  people  -  college 
students  in  particular  -  were  very  high  on  Dave's  list.  And  of  the  ways  to  reach  young 
people,  one-on-one  conversation  -  in  small  group  meetings  using  the  Socratic  method  or  in 
mentor  relationships  -  was  highest. 

■  While  he  supported  public  policy  advocacy  organizations,  his  heart  was  closest  to  the  old 
Foundation  for  Economic  Education  (FEE)  model  of  leading  by  example  and  changing 
people's  minds  one  at  a  time  in  conversations  about  philosophy  and  morality. 

A  Padden  Internship  Program  would  be  a  close  fit  with  what  we  think  Dave  wold  have  wanted 
and  would  benefit  the  freedom  movement  he  loved.  It  could  be  modeled  after  the  Charles  G. 
Koch  Summer  Fellow  Program,  which  is  summarized  here:  http://www. college. Columbia, 
edu/students/  fellowships/catalog/charles-g-koch-summer-fellow-program. 

Features  of  the  Padden  Internship  program  would  include  the  following: 

■  A  26-week  internship  in  Heartland's  Chicago  office,  with  research,  writing,  and  event 
planning  experiences. 

■  A  $3,900  stipend  ($150/week). 

■  Attendance  at  Cato's  annual  "Cato  University  Summer  Seminar,"  a  one-week  program  in 
August.  See  http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v21n2/summerseminar.html  for  details. 
We  would  ask  Cato  to  cover  the  $1,500  registration  and  room  fee,  and  we  would  cover 
travel. 

■  Twelve  Socratic  discussions  over  the  course  of  the  internship  with  Heartland  senior  staff, 
senior  fellows,  and  board  members  around  the  same  table  that  was  in  Dave's  office  for  some 
30  years.  Readings  could  be  by  Bastiat,  Mises,  Hayek,  Friedman,  etc.,  perhaps  taken  from 
The  Libertarian  Reader  edited  by  David  Boaz,  or  the  reading  list  for  Cato  University,  or 
readings  that  Dave  helped  prepare  for  a  Liberty  Fund  seminar  Heartland  organized  some  20 
years  ago.  Final  sessions  could  be  more  policy-oriented  and  based  on  Heartland's  The 
Patriot's  Toolbox. 


Funding:  We  could  ask  current  and  past  Heartland  board  members,  who  knew  Dave  well,  to 
contribute  $5,000  or  $10,000  more  than  they  would  otherwise  give,  to  raise  the  first  $100,000 
toward  a  fund  that  would  pay  for  ten  years  of  internships.  With  this  evidence  of  Board  support, 
we  could  then  approach  persons  we  knew  to  be  his  friends,  who  served  on  other  boards  with  him, 
and  heads  of  think  tanks  that  benefit  from  his  generosity.  Donors  to  the  fund  could  be  recognized 
in  the  following  ways: 


-16- 


■  Names  of  funders  could  be  inscribed  on  a  plaque  to  hang  on  a  wall  near  the  table  where  the 
Socratic  discussions  take  place. 

■  A  special  reception  prior  to  or  following  the  President's  Council  Retreat  to  which  current  and 
former  Padden  Interns  would  be  invited. 

■  An  e-newsletter  and  blog  could  be  created  for  donors  and  current  and  past  interns  to  stay  in 
touch  with  each  other. 

Heartland's  2012  budget  forecasts  two  interns  for  each  of  five  departments,  with  a  budget  of 
$39,000.  Adding  travel  to  the  Cato  event  at  $800  for  each  of  the  ten  interns  boosts  the  annual 
budget  to  $47,000.  We  could  plan  to  fundraise  for  a  fund  that  would  finance  the  David  H. 
Padden  Internship  Program  for  ten  years,  requiring  gifts  totaling  $470,000.  Anything  above  that 
amount  raised  or  earned  in  interest  or  investment  could  be  devoted  to  a  variety  of  additional 
activities  involving  the  interns  or  extend  the  program  beyond  10  years. 

For  the  2012  budget,  we  forecast  raising  half  the  total  amount  needed  to  endow  this  10-year 
project,  or  $235,000. 

G.  Cook  County  Public  Debt  Project 

Maria  Pappas,  Cook  County  (IL)  Treasurer,  has  discovered  that  municipalities  and  other  taxing 
districts  in  Cook  County  are  much  deeper  in  debt  than  is  widely  understood,  or  even  understood 
by  elected  officials  in  Cook  County.  She  has  documented  a  looming  financial  crisis,  driven 
largely  by  employee  pension  and  health  care  promises,  that  could  have  catastrophic  results  for 
residents  and  businesses  in  the  county.  She  warns  that  other  counties  in  the  U.S.  are  probably 
facing  similar  disasters.  She's  eager  to  speak  out  on  the  issue  not  only  in  Illinois,  but  nationwide. 

Heartland  has  agreed  to  work  with  Treasurer  Pappas 's  staff  and  other  allies  on  three  things: 

(a)  a  research  and  publishing  effort  that  results  in  one  or  more  Heartland  Policy  Studies  that  fact- 
check,  report,  and  interpret  the  Treasurers'  findings, 

(b)  a  national  communications  campaign  consisting  of  distribution  of  the  studies,  news  releases, 
op-eds,  and  other  promotional  activities,  and 

(c)  a  national  speaking  tour  featuring  Treasurer  Pappas,  perhaps  with  events  in  state  capitals  held 
in  conjunction  with  our  allies  in  a  dozen  or  half-dozen  states. 

We  anticipate  that  this  project  will  cost  about  $210,000.  The  anonymous  donor  has  pledged 
$105,000  toward  this  project.  We  are  circulating  a  proposal  to  potential  donors.

H.  Global  Warming  Curriculum  for  K-12  Schools 

Many  people  lament  the  absence  of  educational  material  suitable  for  K-12  students  on  global 
warming  that  isn't  alarmist  or  overtly  political.  Heartland  has  tried  to  make  material  available  to 
teachers,  but  has  had  only  limited  success.  Principals  and  teachers  are  heavily  biased  toward  the 
alarmist  perspective.  Moreover,  material  for  classroom  use  must  be  carefully  written  to  meet 
curriculum  guidelines,  and  the  amount  of  time  teachers  have  for  supplemental  material  is 
steadily  shrinking  due  to  the  spread  of  standardized  tests  in  K-12  education. 

Dr.  David  Wojick  has  presented  Heartland  a  proposal  to  produce  a  global  warming  curriculum 
for  K-12  schools  that  appears  to  have  great  potential  for  success.  Dr.  Wojick  is  a  consultant  with 
the  Office  of  Scientific  and  Technical  Information  at  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  in  the  area 
of  information  and  communication  science.  He  has  a  Ph.D.  in  the  philosophy  of  science  and 
mathematical  logic  from  the  University  of  Pittsburgh  and  a  B.S.  in  civil  engineering  from 
Carnegie  Tech.  He  has  been  on  the  faculty  of  Carnegie  Mellon  and  the  staffs  of  the  U.S.  Office 
of  Naval  Research  and  the  Naval  Research  Lab. 

Dr.  Wojick  has  conducted  extensive  research  on  environmental  and  science  education  for  the 
Department  of  Energy.  In  the  course  of  this  research,  he  has  identified  what  subjects  and 
concepts  teachers  must  teach,  and  in  what  order  (year  by  year),  in  order  to  harmonize  with 
national  test  requirements.  He  has  contacts  at  virtually  all  the  national  organizations  involved  in 
producing,  certifying,  and  promoting  science  curricula. 

Dr.  Wojick  proposes  to  begin  work  on  "modules"  for  grades  10-12  on  climate  change  ("whether 
humans  are  changing  the  climate  is  a  major  scientific  controversy"),  climate  models  ("models 
are  used  to  explore  various  hypotheses  about  how  climate  works.  Their  reliability  is 
controversial"),  and  air  pollution  ("whether  C02  is  a  pollutant  is  controversial.  It  is  the  global 
food  supply  and  natural  emissions  are  20  times  higher  than  human  emissions"). 

Wojick  would  produce  modules  for  Grades  7-9  on  environmental  impact  ("environmental  impact 
is  often  difficult  to  determine.  For  example  there  is  a  major  controversy  over  whether  or  not 
humans  are  changing  the  weather"),  for  Grade  6  on  water  resources  and  weather  systems,  and  so 
on. 

We  tentatively  plan  to  pay  Dr.  Wojick  $5,000  per  module,  about  $25,000  a  quarter,  starting  in 
the  second  quarter  of  2012,  for  this  work.  The  Anonymous  Donor  has  pledged  the  first  $100,000 
for  this  project,  and  we  will  circulate  a  proposal  to  match  and  then  expand  upon  that  investment. 

I.  Hydraulic  Fracturing  Project 

Hydraulic  fracturing,  popularly  known  as  "fracking,"  is  a  process  whereby  water,  sand,  and 
small  amounts  of  chemicals  (surfactants)  are  injected  into  oil  and  natural  gas  formations  to  make 
the  energy  resources  easier  to  extract.  Fracking  has  been  safely  used  for  more  than  50  years. 


-18- 


Fracking  became  controversial  in  2010  and  2011  because  environmentalists,  hoping  to  prevent 
the  development  of  large  reserves  of  oil  and  natural  case  in  the  Marcellus  Shale  Formation, 
invented  charges  that  fracking  poses  environmental  and  safety  risks.  The  liberal  media  has 
uncritically  reported  these  charges  as  though  they  were  scientifically  based,  leading  to  pressure 
on  national  and  state  elected  officials  to  ban  or  regulate  the  use  of  fracking. 

Heartland  has  been  one  of  the  most  outspoken  defenders  of  fracking  in  the  U.S.,  using 
Environment  &  Climate  News,  its  Web  sites,  and  its  PR  and  GR  operations  to  comment  repeated 
on  the  issue  and  reach  large  audiences.  We  have  not,  however,  yet  attempted  to  raise  funds  from 
businesses  with  a  financial  interest  in  fracking.  In  2012  we  intend  to  correct  that  oversight  and 
approach  dozens  of  companies  and  trade  associations  that  are  actively  seeking  allies  in  this 
battle. 

The  budget  for  this  project  consists  almost  entirely  of  current  budgeted  expenditures  on  research, 
PR,  and  GR.  We  are  breaking  out  summaries  of  what  we've  already  done  on  the  topic  and  plan 
to  do,  to  submit  to  potential  donors.  We  hope  to  raise  $100,000  for  the  topic  in  2012,  with  half 
this  amount  coming  from  first-time  and  lapsed  donors. 

J.  Weather  Stations  Project 

Every  few  months,  weathermen  report  that  a  temperature  record  -  either  high  or  low  -  has  been 
broken  somewhere  in  the  U.S.  This  is  not  surprising,  since  weather  is  highly  variable  and  reliable 
instrument  records  date  back  less  than  100  years  old.  Regrettably,  news  of  these  broken  records 
is  often  used  by  environmental  extremists  as  evidence  that  human  emissions  are  causing  either 
global  warming  or  the  more  ambiguous  "climate  change." 

Anthony  Watts,  a  meteorologist  who  hosts  WattsUpwithThat.com,  one  of  the  most  popular  and 
influential  science  blogs  in  the  world,  has  documented  that  many  of  the  temperature  stations 
relied  on  by  weathermen  are  compromised  by  heat  radiating  from  nearby  buildings,  machines,  or 
paved  surfaces.  It  is  not  uncommon  for  these  stations  to  over-state  temperatures  by  3  or  4 
degrees  or  more,  enough  to  set  spurious  records. 

Because  of  Watts'  past  work  exposing  flaws  in  the  current  network  of  temperature  stations  (work 
that  The  Heartland  Institute  supported  and  promoted),  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Atmospheric 
Administration  (NOAA),  the  government  agency  responsible  for  maintaining  temperature 
stations  in  the  U.S.,  has  designated  a  new  network  of  higher-quality  temperature  stations  that 
meet  its  citing  specifications.  Unfortunately,  NOAA  doesn't  widely  publicize  data  from  this  new 
network,  and  puts  raw  data  in  spreadsheets  buried  on  one  of  its  Web  sites. 

Anthony  Watts  proposes  to  create  a  new  Web  site  devoted  to  accessing  the  new  temperature  data 
from  NOAA's  web  site  and  converting  them  into  easy-to-understand  graphs  that  can  be  easily 
found  and  understood  by  weathermen  and  the  general  interested  public.  Watts  has  deep  expertise 
in  Web  site  design  generally  and  is  well-known  and  highly  regarded  by  weathermen  and 


-19- 


meteorologists  everywhere.  The  new  site  will  be  promoted  heavily  at  WattsUpwithThat.com. 

Heartland  has  agreed  to  help  Anthony  raise  $88,000  for  the  project  in  201 1.  The  Anonymous 
Donor  has  already  pledged  $44,000.  We'll  seek  to  raise  the  balance. 

7.  Planned  Giving 

Planned  giving  encompasses  activities  as  simple  as  naming  a  charity  in  one's  will  to  complex 
insurance  schemes  and  charitable  remainder  trusts.  As  baby  boomers  retire,  planning  giving  is 
rising  as  a  share  of  total  giving  to  Heartland  and  to  other  charities. 

In  2012,  Heartland  will  finally  launch  a  true  planned  giving  program  with  the  following  parts: 

■  A  Planned  Giving  Board  consisting  of  estate  planning  and  planned  giving  professionals  who 
are  Heartland  donors.  Dan  Hales  has  agreed  to  chair  this  board. 

■  Advertisements  in  our  publications  and  newsletters  and  on  our  Web,  and  a  brochure  briefly 
making  the  case  for  including  Heartland  in  your  will  and  estate  planning. 

■  A  white  paper  that  provides  more  detailed  guidance  to  planned  giving,  explaining  the  tax 
advantages  and  choices  involving  several  popular  options. 

Amanda  Evans  is  in  charge  of  the  project. 


4.  Anonymous  Donor 

Because  the  Anonymous  Donor  has  given  a  large  percentage  of  Heartland's  budget  in  past  years, 
it  is  useful  to  single  out  his  expected  gift  at  the  beginning  of  the  year. 

In  2011,  he  gave  Heartland  $979,000,  less  than  any  years  since  2005.  In  January  2012,  he 
pledged  $1  million.  We  project  that  he  will  give  $250,000  more  over  the  course  of  the  year. 

Table  5  summarizes  the  recent  history  of  the  Anonymous  Donor's  giving,  and  Table  6  breaks  out 
the  projects  he  has  already  agreed  to  support  in  2012  and  those  we  hope  he  will  agree  to  fund  as 
the  year  progresses.  We  believe  the  increase  from  201 1  to  2012  is  reasonable  in  part  because 
201  l's  level  of  giving  was  the  lowest  since  2005  and  seemed  to  be  due  to  some  developments 
that  are  now  past.  Until  201 1,  he  had  given  more  than  $1,250,000  every  year  since  2005.

5.  Renewing  Donors  of  $10,000+ 

In  2012,  we  expect  to  raise  $4.1  million  from  past  major  donors  of  $10,000  or  more,  not 
including  the  Anonymous  Donor,  an  increase  of  26  percent  from  201 1  income  from  these  same 
donors.  Table  7  shows  the  dollar  amounts.

Not  all  donors  renew  every  year,  and  some  increase  their  gifts  while  others  reduce  them.  In 
alternating  years  we  do  zero-based  budgeting  on  the  fundraising  side  of  the  budget  by  estimating 
income  from  specific  donors.  In  the  other  years,  we  just  project  a  percentage  increase  in  giving 
by  each  category.  This  year  is  a  zero-based  budgeting  year. 

The  names  of  past  donors  of  $10,000  or  more,  their  gifts  during  the  past  two  years,  and  their 
projected  giving  in  2012  appear  in  Table  8.  Obviously,  this  is  only  a  forecast  and  won't  be 
entirely  accurate.

6.  Renewing  Donors  of  $2,500  -  $9,999 


In  201 1  we  raised  approximately  $1 15,1 1 1  from  donors  who  gave  $2,500  -  $9,999.  These  are 
prime  candidates  to  increase  their  giving  in  2012.  We  forecast  a  74%  increase  in  income  from 
these  donors,  to  $200,250,  in  2012.  See  Table  9.

7.  Lapsed  and  New  Donors 

A  complete  prospects  table  that  can  be  sorted  by  project  and  dollar  amount  is  being  produced  for 
2012.  Projected  gifts  from  persons  and  organizations  in  this  "donor  pyramid"  can  be  entered  and 
discounted  by  their  probability  of  arriving.  This  is  a  standard  part  of  fundraising  plans.  The 
pyramid  for  2012  is  not  yet  completed.  Much  of  it  being  captured  from  ACT!  and  Paradox  data 
pulls,  and  then  supplemented  by  the  sources  and  methods  described  in  Part  3  (especially  Table  3) 
earlier  in  this  plan. 

We  can  estimate  income  coming  from  lapsed  and  first-time  donors  if  we  make  two  somewhat 
heroic  assumptions:  (1)  that  we  will  fully  fund  the  10  projects  described  in  Part  3,  Section  6 
("Major  Project  Fundraising,"  starting  on  page  12),  and  (2)  that  half  of  the  funds  raised  for  these 
projects  will  come  from  new  donors,  and  so  won't  be  double  counted  as  part  of  renewal  income. 
An  exception  to  these  assumptions  is  that  funds  raised  from  new  donors  in  Chicago's  financial 
community  would  equal  100%  of  the  $100,000  goal  set  for  2012. 


Table  11,  below,  summarizes  the  projected  income  if  these  assumptions  are  right,  and  Table  12 
lists  the  individual  projects  and  their  budgets.

8.  Cost  of  Fundraising 

The  cost  of  fundraising  is  spending  by  the  Development  Department  as  a  percentage  of  funds 
raised.  We  forecast  it  will  rise  to  10.4  percent  in  2012,  from  7.3  percent  in  201 1,  due  mainly  to 
the  large  investment  planned  in  Direct  Mail.  The  Direct  Mail  campaign  is  expected  to  cost 
$424,000  in  2012,  over  half  the  entire  budget  for  the  development  department. 

Excluding  gifts  from  the  Anonymous  Donor  reveals  the  projected  cost  of  fundraising  from  all 
other  sources  in  2012  would  be  12.4  percent,  lower  than  all  but  one  previous  years  since  2006. 
See  Table  13  for  a  recent  history  of  our  cost  of  fundraising. 

In  past  years  when  the  Anonymous  Donor' s  gifts  were  more  than  half  of  our  budget,  we  were 
spending  a  lot  more  trying  to  raise  funds  from  other  sources.  Last  year,  201 1,  was  quite  low  as 
we  went  half  the  year  without  a  development  director  and  didn't  do  any  direct  mail.

9.  Earned  Income 

In  addition  to  income  generated  by  the  development  department,  Heartland  earns  income  from 
selling  tickets  to  non-fundraising  events,  sale  of  publications  and  subscriptions,  advertising,  and 
interest.  Although  not  the  responsibility  of  the  Development  Department,  projections  of  income 
from  these  sources  appear  in  Table  14.

Income  from  non-fundraising  events  was  relatively  high  in  2011  because  we  hosted  a  successful 
International  Conference  on  Climate  Change.  Without  one  this  year,  we  expect  receipts  from 
ticket  sales  to  fall  by  half.  Advertising  sales,  publication  sales,  and  interest  income  all  are 
expected  to  remain  unchanged.
