ATTACHED  TO  AND  MADE  A  PART  OF  THAT  CERTAIN  OIL,  GAS  AND  MINERAL  LEASE  DATED  THE  6th  DAY  OF  NOVEMBER, 
2008,  BETWEEN  LARRY  SCOTT  KIRKLAND  AND  WIFE,  SHERRIE  ANN  KIRKLAND,  AS  LESSOR,  AND  XTO  ENERGY  INC.,  AS 
LESSEE,  COVERING  0.452  ACRES  OF  LAND,  MORE  OR  LESS,  OUT  OF  THE  D.  PACE  SURVEY,  ABSTRACT  NO.  1245,  IN 
TARRANT  COUNTY,  TEXAS. 


THE  PROVISIONS  OF  ADDENDUM  SUPERSEDE  COMPLETELY  ANY  PROVISIONS  TO  THE  CONTRARY  CONTAINED  IN  THE 
LEASE  TO  WHICH  THIS  ADDENDUM  IS  ATTACHED. 

15.  Minerals  Covered.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  hereof,  this  lease  covers  only  oil  and  gas.  The  term  "oil  and 
gas"  means  oil,  gas,  and  other  liquid  and  gaseous  hydrocarbons  and  their  constituent  elements  produced  through  a  well 
bore. 

16.  Gas  Royalty,  (a)  Royalties  on  oil,  gas  and  other  substances  produced  and  saved  hereunder  shall  be  paid  by  Lessee 
to  Lessor  as  follows:  (a)  for  oil  and  other  liquid  hydrocarbons  separated  at  Lessee's  separator  facilities,  the  royalty  shall 
be  twenty  five  percent  (25%)  of  such  production,  to  be  delivered  at  Lessee's  option  to  Lessor  at  the  wellhead  or  to 
Lessor's  credit  at  the  oil  purchaser's  transportation  facilities,  provided  that  Lessee  shall  have  the  continuing  right  to 
purchase  such  production  at  the  wellhead  market  price  then  prevailing  in  the  same  field  (or  if  there  is  no  such  price  then 
prevailing  in  the  same  field,  then  in  the  nearest  field  in  which  there  is  such  a  prevailing  price)  for  production  of  similar 
grade  and  gravity;  and  (b)  for  gas  (including  casinghead  gas)  and  all  other  substances  covered  hereby,  the  royalty  shall 
be  twenty  five  percent  (25%)  of  the  proceeds  realized  by  Lessee  from  the  sale  thereof,  computed  at  the  point  of  sale, 
less  a  proportionate  part  of  ad  valorem  taxes  and  production,  severance  or  other  excise  taxes,  and  less  the  permitted 
unaffiliated  third  party  deductions  described  below;  provided  that  Lessee  shall  have  the  continuing  right  to  purchase 
such  production  at  the  prevailing  wellhead  market  price  paid  for  production  of  similar  quality  in  the  same  field  (or  if  there 
is  no  such  price  then  prevailing  in  the  same  field,  then  in  the  nearest  field  in  which  there  is  such  a  prevailing  price) 
pursuant  to  comparable  purchase  contracts  entered  into  on  the  same  or  nearest  preceding  date  as  the  date  on  which 
Lessee  commences  its  purchases  hereunder. 

(b)  Royalties  on  oil,  gas  and  other  substances  produced  and  saved  hereunder  which  are  processed  in  a  processing 
plant  in  which  Lessee,  or  an  affiliate  of  Lessee,  has  a  direct  or  indirect  interest,  shall  be  calculated  based  upon  the 
higher  of  the  proceeds  received  or  the  market  value  of  the  products  so  processed.  Similarly,  on  oil,  gas  and  other 
substances  produced  and  saved  hereunder  which  are  sold  to  Lessee,  or  an  affiliate  of  Lessee,  royalties  shall  be  paid 
based  upon  the  higher  of  the  market  value  of  the  products  so  sold  and  the  proceeds  received  by  Lessee  for  said 
products.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  herein,  except  for  nonaffiliated  third-party  charges  incurred  or  paid 
by  Lessee,  in  no  event  shall  any  of  Lessor's  royalty  bear  any  part  of  the  costs  of  production  or  any  post-production  costs, 
including  costs  of  lifting,  gathering,  dehydration,  compression,  separation,  delivery,  transportation,  manufacture, 
processing,  treating  or  marketing,  or  for  construction,  operation  or  depreciation  of  any  plant  or  other  facility  or 
equipment  for  processing  or  treating  oil  or  gas  produced  from  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith.  In  no 
event  shall  Lessor  receive  a  price  greater  than  or  less  than  Lessee  in  sales  to  nonaffiliates. 

(c)  As  used  herein,  "affiliate"  means  (i)  a  corporation,  joint  venture,  partnership  or  other  entity  that  owns  more  than  ten 
percent  (10%)  of  the  outstanding  voting  interest  of  Lessee  or  in  which  Lessee  owns  more  than  ten  percent  (10%)  of  the 
outstanding  voting  interest;  or  (ii)  a  corporation,  joint  venture,  partnership  or  other  entity  in  which,  together  with  Lessee, 
more  than  ten  percent  (10%)  of  the  outstanding  voting  interest  of  both  the  Lessee  and  the  other  corporation,  joint 
venture,  partnership  or  other  entity  is  owned  or  controlled  by  the  same  person  or  group  of  persons. 

17.  Shut-in  Royalty.  If  at  the  end  of  the  primary  term  or  any  time  thereafter  one  or  more  wells  on  the  leased  premises  or 
lands  pooled  therewith  are  capable  of  producing  oil  or  gas  or  other  substances  covered  hereby  in  paying  quantities,  but 
such  well  or  wells  are  either  shut-in  or  production  therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee,  such  well  or  wells  shall 
nevertheless  be  deemed  to  be  producing  in  paying  quantities  for  the  purpose  of  maintaining  this  Lease.  A  well  that  has 
been  drilled  but  not  traced  shall  be  deemed  capable  of  producing  in  paying  quantities.  If  for  a  period  of  ninety  (90) 
consecutive  days  such  well  or  wells  are  shut-in  or  production  therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee,  then  Lessee  shall 
pay  shut-in  royalty  of  twenty  five  dollars  ($25.00)  per  acre  then  covered  by  this  Lease  on  or  before  the  end  of  said 
90-day  period  and  thereafter  on  or  before  each  anniversary  of  the  date  the  first  payment  is  due;  provided,  however,  that 
if  this  Lease  is  otherwise  being  maintained  by  operations,  or  if  production  is  being  sold  by  Lessee  from  another  well  or 
wells  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  no  shut-in  royalty  shall  be  due  until  the  end  of  the  90-day  period 
next  following  cessation  of  such  operations  or  production.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  herein,  it  is 
expressly  understood  and  agreed  that  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term,  Lessee  shall  not  have  the  right  to 
continue  this  Lease  in  force  by  payment  of  shut-in  royalty  for  more  than  one  single  period  of  up  to  two  (2)  consecutive 
years. 

18.  No  Surface  Operations.  It  is  hereby  agreed  and  understood  that  there  shall  be  no  drilling  activities  on  the  surface  of 
the  leased  premises  without  the  prior  written  permission  from  the  surface  owner  of  the  applicable  portion  of  the  teased 
premises.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  this  waiver  of  surface  shall  not  be  construed  as  a  waiver  of  the  rights  of 
Lessee  to  utilize  the  subsurface  of  the  leased  premises  under  this  lease,  and  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  to  exploit, 
explore  for,  develop  and  produce  oil,  gas  and  other  covered  minerals  under  this  lease  from  wells  from  surface  locations 
off  the  leased  premises,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  directional  or  horizontal  drilling  activity  which  comes  under  the 
surface  of  the  leased  premises.  This  drilling  surface  waiver  does  not  apply  to  any  surface  rights  associated  with 
instalments  other  than  this  lease. 

1 9.  Vertical  Pugh.  Upon  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term  of  this  Lease,  upon  the  expiration  of  any  extension  or  renewal  of 
the  primary  term,  or  after  cessation  of  operations  as  provided  herein,  whichever  occurs  last,  this  Lease  shall  terminate 
as  to  all  rights  lying  below  one  hundred  feet  (1 00')  below  the  stratigraphic  equivalent  of  the  deepest  formation  drilled. 

20.  No  Warranties.  Lessor  makes  no  warranty  of  any  kind  with  respect  to  title  to  the  Land.  By  acceptance  of  this  Lease, 
Lessee  acknowledges  that  it  has  been  given  every  opportunity  to  investigate  and  has  conducted  sufficient  investigation 
to  satisfy  itself  as  to  the  title  to  the  Land,  and  Lessee  assumes  all  risk  of  title  failures.  All  warranties  that  might  arise  by 
common  law  or  by  statute,  including  but  not  limited  to  Section  5.023  of  the  Texas  Property  Code  (or  its  successors),  are 
excluded.  If  Lessor  owns  an  interest  in  the  Land  less  than  the  entire  fee  simple  estate,  then  the  royalties  (including 
shut-in  royalties)  payable  hereunder  will  be  reduced  proportionately.  All  royalty  interest  covered  by  this  lease  (whether 
or  not  owned  by  Lessor)  shall  be  paid  out  of  the  royalty  herein  provided.  Lessor  will  use  all  its  reasonable  efforts  to 
assist  Lessee  to  subordinate  any  rights  of  a  mortgage  holder  to  perfect  the  Lessee's  rights  under  this  lease;  provided, 
however,  any  necessary  subordination  shall  be  obtained  by  Lessee  at  Lessee's  sole  expense.  In  the  event  Lessee  is 
unable  to  obtain  a  subordination  agreement,  Lessee,  at  its  option,  may  discharge  any  tax,  mortgage,  or  other  lien  or 
interest  and  other  charges  on  the  Land  superior  to  this  Lease,  and  in  the  event  Lessee  does  so,  Lessee  will  have  the 


option  of  applying  the  royalties  accruing  to  Lessor  toward  payment  of  same  and  Lessee  shall  be  subrogated  to  the 
rights  of  the  holder  thereof. 


Indemnity.  Lessee  hereby  releases  and  discharges  Lessor  and  the  owner  of  the  surface  estate,  along  with 
their  officers,  employees,  partners,  agents,  contractors,  subcontractors,  guests  and  invitees,  and  their 
respective  heirs,  successors  and  assigns  (collectively  the  "Lessor  Parties"),  of  and  from  all  and  any  actions 
and  causes  of  action  of  every  nature,  or  other  harm,  including  environmental  harm,  for  which  recovery  of 
damages  is  sought,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  all  losses  and  expenses  which  are  caused  by  the  activities  of 
Lessee,  its  officers,  employees  and  agents  arising  out  of,  incidental  to  or  resulting  from,  the  operations  of  or 
for  Lessee  on  or  under  the  leased  premises  or  at  the  drill  site  or  operations  site  or  that  may  arise  out  of  or  be 
occasioned  by  Lessee's  breach  of  any  of  the  terms  or  provisions  of  this  Lease,  or  by  any  other  negligent  or 
strictly  liable  act  or  omission  of  Lessee.  Further,  Lessee  hereby  agrees  to  be  liable  for,  exonerate,  indemnify, 
defend  and  hold  harmless  the  Lessor  Parties  against  any  and  all  claims,  liabilities,  losses,  damages,  actions, 
property  damage,  personal  injury  (including  death),  costs  and  expenses,  or  other  harm  for  which  recovery  of 
damages  is  sought,  under  any  theory  including  tort,  contract,  statute  or  strict  liability,  including  attorney  fees 
and  other  legal  expenses,  including  those  related  to  environmental  hazards  on  or  under  the  leased  premises 
or  at  the  drill  site  or  operations  site  or  in  any  way  related  to  Lessee's  failure  to  comply  with  any  and  all 
environmental  laws;  those  arising  from  or  in  any  way  related  to  Lessee's  operations  or  any  other  of  Lessee's 
activities  in,  on  or  under  the  leased  premises  or  at  the  drill  site  or  operations  site;  those  arising  from  Lessee's 
use  of  the  surface  or  subsurface  of  the  leased  premises;  and  those  that  may  arise  out  of  or  be  occasioned  by 
Lessee's  breach  of  any  of  the  terms  or  provisions  of  this  Lease  or  any  other  act  or  omission  of  Lessee,  its 
directors,  officers,  employees,  partners,  agents,  contractors,  subcontractors,  guests,  invitees  and  their 
respective  successors  and  assigns.  Each  assignee  of  this  Lease,  or  of  an  interest  herein,  agrees  to  be  liable 
for,  exonerate,  indemnify,  defend  and  hold  harmless  the  Lessor  Parties  in  the  same  manner  provided  above  in 
connection  with  the  activities  of  Lessee,  its  officers,  employees  and  agents  as  described  above  EXCEPT  AS 
OTHERWISE  EXPRESSLY  LIMITED  HEREIN,  ALL  OF  THE  INDEMNITY  OBLIGATIONS  AND/OR  LIABILITIES 
ASSUMED  UNDER  THE  TERMS  OF  THIS  LEASE  SHALL  BE  WITHOUT  LIMITS  AND  WITHOUT  REGARD  TO  THE 
CAUSE  OR  CAUSES  THEREOF  (EXCLUDING  PRE-EXISTING  CONDITIONS),  STRICT  LIABILITY  OR  THE 
NEGLIGENCE  OF  ANY  PARTY  OR  PARTIES  (INCLUDING  THE  NEGLIGENCE  OF  THE  INDEMNIFIED  PARTY), 
WHETHER  SUCH  NEGLIGENCE  BE  SOLE,  JOINT,  CONCURRENT,  ACTIVE  OR  PASSIVE. 


22.  Noise  levels  associated  with  Lessee's  operations  related  to  the  drilling,  completion  and  reworking  of  wells  shall  comply 
with  the  City  of  Fort  Worth  Drilling  Ordinance,  as  amended. 

23.  Limited  Power  of  Attorney  to  Obtain  Subordination  Agreement.  By  the  execution  of  this  Lease,  Lessor  does 
hereby  appoint  and  designate  Lessee,  its  successors  and  assigns,  as  its  attorneys-in-fact  solely  for  the  limited  purpose 
of  allowing  Lessee  to  contact  Lessor's  lender  or  mortgagor  (if  any)  on  behalf  of  Lessor  to  obtain  a  lien  subordination 
agreement  or  other  similar  document  for  purposes  of  subordinating  any  mortgage  on  the  leased  premises  to  Lessee's 
interests  in  this  lease.  Lessee  will  mail  a  copy  of  the  executed  and  recorded  lien  subordination  agreement  or  similar 
agreement  when  finalized.  When  Lessee  has  finalized  its  lien  subordination  agreement  or  similar  agreement  with 
Lessor's  lender  or  mortgagor,  this  limited  power-of-attorney  to  the  Lessee  shall  in  all  respects  terminate  and 
automatically  be  revoked.  Lessee  shall  bear  any  and  all  costs  associated  with  obtaining  any  such  lien  subordination 
agreement  or  similar  agreement. 

24.  Waiver  of  Claims  as  to  Gas  Lease  Committee  and  Acknowledgement  of  Independent  Legal  Advice.  Lessor 
acknowledges  that  the  terms  of  this  Lease,  the  amount  of  royalty  and  bonus  paid  hereunder,  and  other  terms  negotiated 
with  Lessee  with  respect  to  this  Lease  (the  "Negotiated  Terms")  were  obtained  as  a  result  of  negotiations  between 
Lessee  and  a  group  known  as  the  Greater  Lake  Country  Gas  Leasing  Task  Force  ("GLCGLTF"),  which  consisted  of  a 
committee  of  unpaid  volunteers,  including  Brad  Shaw,  Carl  Wilson,  Dick  Deatrick,  Dennis  Shingleton,  Nora  Donavan, 
Margaret  Hamlin,  Jim  Usher,  Cecilia  Valdez,  Phil  Fox,  Craig  Zieres,  Dave  Newell,  Ginger  Mayronne,  Robert  Fife,  Fred 
Villarreal  (the  "GLCGLTF  Gas  Lease  Committee").  In  consideration  of  the  efforts  of  the  GLCGLTF  in  negotiating  and 
obtaining  the  Negotiated  Terms,  Lessor,  individually  and  on  behalf  of  Lessor's  agents,  representatives,  family  members, 
predecessors,  successors,  heirs  and  assigns,  hereby  releases  and  forever  discharges  GLCGLTF,  the  GLCGLTF,  and 
any  of  GLCGLTF's  or  the  GLCGLTF  Gas  Lease  Committee's  members,  agents,  and  representatives  specifically 
including  any  attorneys  engaged  by  the  GLCGLTF  Gas  Lease  Committee  to  facilitate  the  solicitation  of  bids  and 
negotiation  of  lease  terms  (the  "GLCGLTF  Releases"),  of  and  from  any  and  all  claims,  demands,  obligations,  losses, 
causes  of  action,  costs,  expenses,  attorney's  fees,  and  liabilities  of  any  nature  whatsoever,  whether  based  on  contract, 
tort,  statute  or  other  legal  or  equitable  theory  of  recovery,  whether  known  or  unknown,  which  Lessor  has,  has  had,  or 
claims  to  have  against  the  GLCGLTF  Releases,  which  arise  out  of  or  relate  to  (a)  the  Negotiated  Terms,  (b)  the 
negotiation  of  the  Negotiated  Terms,  or  (c)  the  inclusion  and/or  omission  of  any  terms  within  the  Negotiated  Terms. 
Lessor  further  acknowledges  and  represents  that  (a)  the  GLCGLTF  Releases  have  not  acted  as  Lessor's  agent  in 
connection  with  this  Lease;  (b)  Lessor,  in  making  the  decision  to  enter  into  this  Lease,  has  not  relied  upon  any 
statements  or  representations,  if  any,  of  the  GLCGLTF  Releases  regarding  the  terms  of  this  Lease;  and  (c)  Lessor's 
decision  to  enter  into  this  Lease  is  the  independent  and  voluntary  decision  of  Lessor  after  being  given  the  opportunity  to 
have  said  Lease  reviewed  by  counsel  of  Lessor's  choosing. 

Executed  on  the  date  first  written  above. 


Lessor: 


Sherrie  Ann  Kirkland
