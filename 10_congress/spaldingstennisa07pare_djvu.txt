With  the  departure  of  F.  B.  Alexander  for  an 
officers'  training  camp,  the  editorship  of  Spalding's 
Annual  was  given  into  the  hands  of  Samuel  Hardy. 

Mr.  Hardy  has  long  been  identified  with  tennis, 
his  first  championship  having  been  won  in  1891, 
when  he,  together  with  his  brother  Sumner,  secured 
the  Pacific  Coast  doubles  title.  A  close  student  of 
the  game,  as  well  as  one  of  its  most  enthusiastic 
supporters,  his  intimate  acquaintance  with  players 
here  and  abroad  makes  him  particularly  well  fitted 
to  succeed  Mr.  Alexander.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNDAL.  U 

Thirty  Years  of  Tennis 

By  Samuel  Hardy. 

When  I  began  to  play  tennis  in  the  late  '80s,  I  was  much  more  concerned 
over  beating  little  Tommy  Jones,  who  lived  aroimd  the  comer,  than  in  the 
struggle  then  waging  for  the  national  championship  at  Newport  between  Beeck- 
man  and  Slocum,  who  aspired  to  defeat  R.  D.  Sears,  seven  times  champion. 
Being  self-taught,  my  racket  grips  and  strokes  were  faulty — I  have  always 
wished  I  might  have  had  a  teacher  in  those  days — and  my  progress  in  the  game 
came  chiefly  from  a  natural  volleying  ability.  By  degrees  my  brother  Sumner 
and  I  forged  ahead  until  we  gained  first  position  in  that  part  of  the  country, 
and  in  1899  we  successfully  defended  the  Pacific  Coast  doubles  against  the 
first  Eastern  invasion. 

The  members  of  this  team  comprised  Whitman,  then  the  national  singles 
champion;  his  young  and  untried  partner,  Beals  Wright,  and  the  national 
doubles  champions.  Ward  and  Davis.  Holcombe  Ward  had  not  then  attained  the 
skill  which  later  made  him  the  American  champion,  but  he  already  was  pro- 
ficient in  the  use  of  the  new  American  twist  service.  Dwight  Davis  had  an  even 
more  terrible  service,  being  left-handed.  When  in  a  winning  streak,  he  carried 
all  before  him.  I  well  remember  how  he  swept  me  off  the  court  when  first  I 
went  up  against  this  horrible  curly  service,  which  broke  away  to  the  forehand, 
almost  out  of  reach.  My  brother  at  once  grasped  the  truth  that  one  must  stand 
well  inside  the  service  line  in  order  to  take  the  ball  on  the  rise,  returning  it 
before  the  server  can  gain  a  place  at  the  net.  Years  later,  Cecil  Parke  was  to 
learn  this  of  McLoughlin's  serve.  I  remember  seeing  him  go  down  easily  in 
straight  sets  in  the  British  championship.  He  stood  six  feet  behind  the  service 
line  when  receiving.  Only  a  few  weeks  later,  he  surprised  his  most  ardent  sup- 
porters by  defeating  McLoughlin  in  the  Davis  Cup  contest  on  the  same  court. 
Everyone  saw  at  a  glance  that  his  success  was  due  to  his  changed  position  in 
receiving  the  service. 

To  return  to  ancient  history,  my  brother  and  I  defended  the  Pacific  Coast 
doubles  with  success.  Whitman  and  Wright  had  put  out  Ward  and  Davis  in 
the  finals  and  the  challenge  round  found  them  too  newly  paired  for  proper  team 
work.  Our  success  was  in  part  due  to  the  excellent  practice  we  had  had  with 
the  Neel  brothers,  Carr  and  Sam,  who  had  recently  moved  from  California  to 
Chicago.  Scarcely  had  they  been  there  a  year  or  two,  when  they  annexed  the 
national  doubles;  while  Carr,  ever  the  better  singles  player,  played  R.  D. 
Wrenn  a  five-set  match  at  Newport  when  Wrenn  was  at  his  best. 

Whitman's  game  at  this  time  had  reached  the  height  of  its  perfection. 
Twice  national  champion  and  without  a  weakness  of  any  kind,  he  combined 
superb  passing  shots  with  a  safe  volley  game.  So  sound  was  he  considered 
overhead,  that  it  was  said  of  him  that  he  considered  every  ball  lobbed  to  him 
as  his  point.  I  still  chuckle,  therefore,  when  I  recall  the  manner  in  which  1 
took  a  set  from  him  in  an  exhibition  match  at  Del  Monte.  Knowing  how  supe- 
rior was  his  backcourt  game  to  mine,  I  resolved  to  bring  him  to  the  net  at 
every  opportunity.  There  I  proposed  to  stay  myself  and  fight  it  out  with  him. 
I  therefore  returned  every  serve  with  a  cut,  with  the  intent  to  drop  it  just  over 
the  net,  knowing  that  it  was  not  his  custom  to  follow  the  serve  in.  For  a  while 
this  worked  like  a  charm;  sometimes  he  would  tear  up  for  a  short  one  and  put 
it  right  into  my  hands;  sometimes  he  would  pass  me  down  the  side  lines.    But 


ANTHONY   F.    WILDING.  1 

Killed  in  action  early  In  May,  1915.  Wilding  was  four  times  champion  of 
England.  He  ended  his  career  as  an  international  player  by  successfully 
invading  the  United  States  in  1914  with  Brookes,  this  famous  Australasian 
pair  winning   the   cliallenge   round   of   the   Davis   Cup   matches   ot    tliat   year. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  13 

the  fact  remains  that  I  took  the  first  set  at  6/1.  Of  course,  when  he  "got 
going,"  he  soon  mastered  this  new  style  of  attack  and  smothered  me;  but  I 
have  always  enjoyed  winning  that  one  set,  which,  by  the  way,  was  the  only  set 
he  lost  that  year  to  so  bad  a  score. 

The  following  year — 1900— Dwight  Davis  presented  to  the  National  Associa- 
tion a  huge  silver  trophy,  in  order  to  stimulate  interest  in  international  matches. 
He  certainly  succeeded  in  his  purpose,  for  the  Davis  Cup  soon  became  famous 
throughout  the  world,  and  no  prize  ever  has  been  more  keenly  sought.  Davis 
and  Whitman  defended  it  successfully  that  year,  and  it  was  not  until  the  second 
attempt  of  the  Dohertys  in  1904  that  the  cup  was  lifted. 

Wrenn,  after  saving  the  American  championship  three  times,  had  now  retired. 
To  his  fine  net  game  he  owed  much  of  his  success,  yet  it  was  his  great  fighting 
spirit  which  made  him  the  idol  of  the  tennis  world.  Essentially  a  match  player, 
he  gallantly  rose  to  whatever  heiglit  the  occasion  demanded,  and  his  gameness 
became  proverbial.  His  daring  net  game  had  much  to  do  with  the  then  pre- 
vailing view  that  "the  net  game  was  the  only  game,"  and  was  far  superior  to 
the  British  backcourt  game,  of  which  Richard  Stevens  was  the  staunchest  and 
ablest  American  supporter  of  his  time.  It  remained  for  a  later  generation  to 
demonstrate  that  it  is  the  combination  of  these  two  styles  of  play  that  forms 
the  ideal  aiTangement. 

Larned  in  1900  had  not  yet  attained  that  perfection  of  play  that  later  enabled 
him  to  retain  the  American  championship  seven  years,  but  he  was  Whitman's 
chief  rival.  The  rising  young  players  of  this  day,  afterward  famous  in  many  a 
championship  and  Davis  Cup  contest,  were  Alexander,  Little,  Hackett,  Clothier 
and  Ware.  Ward  and  Davis  had  already  attained  fame  as  a  national  doubles 
team  and  owed  their  success  not  alone  to  their  fine  team  work,  but  to  the  then 
unique  American  twist  service. 

University  life  and  business  claiming  my  attention  for  a  decade  or  so,  it  was 
not  until  1910  that  I  resumed  tournament  play,  this  time  in  England.  During 
this  interval  Larned  had  come  into  his  own,  while  Ward,  Wright  and  Clothier, 
each  in  turn  American  champion,  had  all  been  exponents  of  the  net  attack. 

When  Brookes  first  won  the  title  of  world's  champion,  the  famous  Dohertys 
had  retired  from  English  tennis.  "H.  L."  is  considered  by  many  in  this  country 
to  be  the  better  player  of  the  two  brothers,  but  in  England  few  share  this  view. 
Did  not  "R.  F."  defend  his  country  against  the  American  invasion  successfully? 
Ward  led  him  two  sets  to  none  before  he  conquered  the  American  twist  service. 
Larned,  Behr,  Collins  and  Wright  all  tried  in  vain.  If  Wright,  while  going 
abroad,  had  not  suffered  an  accident  which  resulted  in  the  loss  of  a  finger  of 
his  playing  hand,  there  might  have  been  another  story  to  tell,  for  he  was 
America's  great  natural  player  and  was  at  the  height  of  his  career.  Years  later 
he  was  able  to  carry  Wilding,  then  at  the  top  of  his  (Wilding's)  game,  to  five 
;ts  before  succumbing  to  superior  stamina.  Some  idea  of  the  closeness  of  this 
latch  may  be  gained  when  one  recalls  that  the  score  of  each  set  was  6/4. 

My  introduction  into  English  termis  life  found  me  playing  with  three  men 
(fho  were  later  to  lose  their  lives  in  the  great  war.  I  was  partnered  by  my  old 
riend,  R.  B.  Powell,  afterward  captain  of  the  Canadian  Davis  Cup  team,  while 
tgainst  us  were  Kenneth  Powell,  England's  champion  hurdler  and  one  of  the 
inest  sportsmen  that  ever  lived,  and  Anthony  Wilding.  The  first  set  equaled  in 
score,  if  not  in  intensity  of  interest,  the  famous  17/15  set  between  Brookes  and 
^cLoughlin.  Wilding  in  those  days  was  not  considered  particularly  good  at 
loubles,  but  his  game  improved  very  much  during  the  next  two  or  three  years. 


NORMAN    E.    BROOKES. 
Australasia's   premier   singles    ijla.ver   and    twice   winner   of    the   English    cham- 
pionship.    Brookes    and    Wilding    have    represented    Australasia    in    Davis    Cup 
matches  since  1905  and  were  a  smooth-worliing  combination. 


BPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  15 

At  singles  he  was  irresistible.  His  obvious  zest  for  the  game,  his  abounding 
vitality  and  endurance  and  his  court  craft,  made  it  a  pleasure  to  watch  him. 
He  successfully  withstood  the  assaults  of  the  players  of  all  countries  save  his 
own.  America  sent  Wright;  Belgium,  de  Borman;  France,  Decugis,  Gobert  and 
Germot;  Germany,  Froitzheim,  Rahe  and  Kreuzer.  Depending,  especially  in  his 
late  years,  almost  solely  on  his  backcourt  game,  though  able  to  volley  well  if 
forced  to  the  net.  Wilding  owed  his  success  largely  to  his  wonderful  physique, 
which  enabled  him  to  cover  miles  of  territory  and  still  maintain  the  sting  in 
his  drives  in  the  fifth  set.  Parke  is  of  like  endurance,  and  had  he  given  the 
same  time  and  attention  to  the  game,  might  well  have  beaten  him. 

When  Wilding  was  at  the  very  height  of  his  fame,  I  well  remember  the  defeat 
he  received  at  Queen's  Club  in  1912,  at  the  hands  of  George  Caridia,  the  famous 
half-voUeyer.  Caridia,  ever  a  comparatively  poor  grass  court  player,  was  at 
his  best  on  the  fast  wood  courts  of  Queen's.  He  has  developed  a  peculiar  style, 
most  exasperating  to  an  opponent.  After  serving,  he  steps  forward  into  that 
most  dangerous  position  to  the  average  player,  half-way  between  the  service 
and  the  base  line.  His  uncanny  half-volleying  ability  enables  him  to  maintain 
this  position  to  advantage.  He  meets  the  return  with  a  sweeping  half-volley, 
which  carries  the  ball  to  a  distant  corner  and  keeps  his  poor  opponent  running 
from  side  to  side  until  he  is  exhausted.  On  this  particular  day,  Caridia  was  at 
his  best  and  kept  the  champion  running  until  even  he  was  obliged  to  rest. 
Caridia  won  four  straight  sets,  6/1,6/2,6/3,6/4,  a  feat  no  other  man  alive  could 
have  accomplished. 

While  this  war  has  deprived  us  of  Wilding,  there  is  still  plenty  of  available 
Davis  Cup  material  in  England  and  on  the  Continent,  and  it  behooves  us  to  gather 
together  our  best  team  for  the  struggle  coming  in  1920.  Gobert  and  Decugis  of 
France  are  still  to  be  reckoned  with,  not  to  mention  Laurenze,  who  once 
defeated  Wilding;  Parke  has  recovered  from  his  wrist  wound  and  both  the 
Lowes  are  fitter  than  ever,  while  Barrett  always  can  be  depended  upon  for  the 
craftiest  game  possible.  Froitzheim,  that  silent  inscrutable  player,  will  again 
head  the  German  team — if  it  be  admitted  to  the  world  of  sport — and  he  is  a 
man  to  be  feared  on  any  court  in  the  world.  Capable  of  winning  from  any  of 
his  countrymen  in  straight  sets,  his  mettle  has  been  tested  in  the  severest  Davis 
Cup  matches.  He  ran  McLoughlin  to  five  sets  and  defeated  Parke.  His  back- 
court  strokes  are  a  model  of  perfection;  his  follow  through  is  apparent  after 
each  shot,  while  his  ability  to  cover  court  in  his  seemingly  listless  manner  is 
equal  to  Wilding's.  Gobert  is  another  player  likely  to  be  heard  from.  Gifted 
with  a  marvelously  smooth  action,  he  always  plays  in  perfect  form,  delivering 
his   speedy   forehand   and   backhand   drives   with   slight   effort. 

In  Australasia,  Doust  and  Dunlop  come  next  in  fame  to  Brookes  and  Wilding; 
indeed,  it  is  the  claim  of  many  that  as  a  doubles  team  the  former  were  supe- 
rior. It  is  doubtful  if  Australasia  can  retain  the  Davis  Cup  without  the  aid  of 
Brookes.  Will  this  great  player  again  defend  his  country?  Who  can  doubt  that 
he  could  do  so  successfully  if  he  would?  Did  he  not,  after  an  absence  of  seven 
years,  return  to  England  and  defeat  Wilding,  four  years  undisputed  champion? 
Brookes  won  in  straight  sets.  His  stronger  personality  so  dominated  Wilding 
that  the  latter  was  unable  at  any  time  to  do  himself  justice. 

On  the  whole,  America  wiU  have  the  likeliest  chance  of  winning  the  Davis 
Cup.  Perhaps  1919  will  bring  forth  new  European  champions;  but  America 
has  suffered  so  little  in  the  war  that,  with  her  greater  field  from  which  to  draw, 
she  should  emerge  triumphant  in  the  coming  struggle. 


DWIGHT    F.    DAVIS, 

St.  Louis,  Mo. 

Donor  of  the   famous   cup   to  promote  international   competition,    but   to  which 

also   must   be   attributed   much   of    the    universal   development   of    lawn   tennis.

Davis  Cup  Prospects 

By  Samuel  Hardy. 

With  the  return  to  more  normal  conditions,  the  most  interesting  question  to 
the  tennis  enthusiast  at  once  becomes,  "Who  will  win  the  Davis  Cup?"  Dur- 
ing the  war,  contests  for  the  coveted  trophy  were  abandoned.  It  was  even  felt 
unsafe  to  intrust  the  famous  cup  to  the  perils  of  the  long  sea  voyage  to  Aus- 
tralia, so  it  has  remained  throughout  the  war  in  this  country. 

Almost  as  soon  as  the  armistice  was  signed,  tennis  associations  throughout 
the  world  began  to  plan  for  the  next  international  competition.  *  France,  always 
an  eager  participant,  issued  an  (immediate  challenge  to  Australasia,  but  our 
Davis  Cup  Committee  felt  that  a  year  of  peace  and  preparation  before  the  next 
contest  would  be  more  fair  to  Great  Britain.  Australasia  had  lost  her  great 
player,  Wilding;  Canada  the  captain  of  her  team,  R.  B.  Powell;  while  England 
had  stated  that  Parke  and  Dixon,  two  of  her  former  team,  no  longer  would  be 
available. 

Without  doubt  there  is  good  Davis  Cup  material  in  all  these  countries,  and 
time  alone  is  needed  for  development  of  the  younger  players.  A  year  will 
prove  all  too  short  a  time  for  turning  out  Davis  Cup  men  of  the  first  flight, 
for  even  McLoughlin  had  to  go  through  an  apprenticeship  of  several  years 
before  attaining  success. 

The  countries  which  are  expected  to  compete  are  the  United  States,  England, 
France,  Canada,  Belgium,  Roumania,  and  possibly  Russia  and  Italy,  the  winner 
to  challenge  the  cup  holder — Australasia.  Japan,  if  only  she  would,  could  enter 
a  strong  team  in  Kumagae,  Kashio  and  Mikami.  Germany  wiU  not  be  eligible, 
since  she  proved  during  the  war  that  she  lacks  the  sporting  instinct.  Her 
slinking  submarines,  her  dastardly  intrigues,  and  her  readiness  to  adopt  any 
dishonorable  means  promising  success,  has  left  her  a  pariah  among  the  civil- 
ized nations  of  the  earth.  It  is  quite  fitting,  therefore,  that  she  be  excluded 
from  the  world  of  sport  while  she  is  still  unregenerate,  although  all  lovers  of 
tennis  regret  the  necessity  of  barring  Froitzheim,  Rahe,  Kreuzer  and  the  Klein- 
schroths,  whose  conduct  on  the  courts  always  has  been  exemplary. 

Of  all  the  teams  that  can  be  entered  by  these  countries,  there  can  be  no 
question  that  the  entry  from  the  United  States  should  be  the  strongest,  with. 
France  or  England  opposed  to  her  in  the  finals. 

The  United  States  has  an  exceptionally  fine  group  of  men  to  draw  uponw. 
With  no  losses  from  the  war  and  her  youthful  champions  strengthened  by 
military  service,  a  season's  practice  should  put  her  men  into  perfect  condition 
and  make  defeat  almost  impossible.  With  Williams,  Johnston,  Murray,  Alex- 
ander, Church,  Strachan  and  Tilden,  two  teams  could  be  formed,  either  of 
which  should  be  able  to  bring  back  the  cup.  Many  think  that  McLoughlin's 
best  tennis  days  are  over,  but  those  who  know  his  game  best,  claim  that  he  is 
quite  capable  of  playing  at  the  top  again,  and  it  is  sincerely  hoped  that  hq- 
will  decide  to  enter  the  race. 

France  will  have  Gobert,  always  a  player  of.  great  possibilities  and  now 
steadied  and  matured  by  his  four  years  of  war;  Decugis,  Germot,  and  the  bril- 
liant Laurenze.  With  such  a  team,  it  is  little  wonder  that  France  issued  an 
immediate  challenge. 


♦England,    France    and    Belgium    issued    a    challenge    to    Australasia    for    1919    shortly    after    thi» 
article   was   written.

England  has  lost  her  greatest  player,  Parke,  who  declares  his  tennis  days  to 
be  over;  but  she  still  has  two  former  Davis  Cup  men  for  the  singles  in  Arthur 
and  Gordon  Lowe.  Gore,  Barrett  and  Ritchie  have  served  their  country  loyally 
for  years,  and  now  may  feel  that  an  opportunity  for  development  should  be 
given  younger  men,  among  the  most  promising  of  whom  are  Davson  and 
Kingscote. 

Canada  scarcely  can  be  considered  a  serious  opponent  without  her  captain, 
R.  B.  Powell,  nor  can  Roumania,  whose  team  doubtless  will  be  headed  by  Mishu. 
Belgium,  too,  will  be  weak,  though  she  still  has  her  captain,  de  Borman. 

Australasia,  despite  the  loss  of  Wilding,  is  capable  of  putting  up  a  stiff 
resistance,  provided  Brookes  competes.  She  has  the  advantage  of  playing  on 
her  own  courts,  and  her  players  are  accustomed  to  the  climate  that  is  always 
so  trying  to  visiting  teams.  Brookes  has  stated  his  willingness  to  compete  in 
1920  if  he  finds  himself  in  good  form  at  that  time.  It  is  to  be  hoped  that 
he  will  participate,  since  Australasia  cannot  possibly  replace  him  in  singles. 
Doust,  Dunlop,  Jones  and  Heath  are  scarcely  good  enough  in  singles  to  oppose 
with  much  hope  of  success  the  winning  team  which  will  have  proven  itself 
master  of  the  rest  of  the  world.  But  it  is  known  that  Brookes  has  hopes  of 
the  younger  generation.  Gerald  Patterson,  whose  style  is  somewhat  that  of 
Wilding's,  is  his  first  choice,  while  the  more  brilliant  but  less  dependable 
Anderson  is  a  close  second.     O'Hara  Wood  and  Sandral  are  also  possibilities. 

In  doubles,  Brookes  would  not  be  so  vitally  necessary  to  success.  Doust  and 
Dunlop  were  considered  by  many  to  be  a  better  combination  than  Brookes  and 
Wilding,  an  opinion  shared  by  the  former  pair,  since  they  repeatedly  tried, 
without  success,  to  engage  the  more  famous  pair  in  a  sporting  match. 

Some  indication  of  the  personnel  of  the  1920  teams  may  be  gained  by  watch- 
ing for  the  winners  of  this  year's  tournaments.  There  now  seems  every  like- 
lihood that  the  younger  element  will  displace  a  few  of  the  veterans,  as  every 
country  realizes  the  necessity  of  training  its  young  men  for  future  contests. 
But  while  the  rivalry  will  be  intense,  the  spirit  of  the  contenders  will  be  most 
friendly,  as  befits  allies  who  have  gone  through  a  war  together  fighting  in  a 
common  cause.  This  alliance  was  in  a  measure  made  possible  by  the  friendly 
feeling  created  in  no  small  degree  by  international  contests,  and  it  is  to  be 
hoped  that  future  competitions  will  only  serve  to  cement  the  cordial  relation- 
ship now  existing  between  these  countries.

Resume  of|the  1918  Tennis.  Season 

By  Samuel  Hardy. 

When  America  responded  to  the  call  of  the  Allies  in  the  great  war  by  send- 
ng  abroad  her  armies  with  unprecedented  dispatch,  tennis  men  from  all  parts 
)f  the  country  were  among  the  first  to  enlist;  indeed  many  of  them  were 
ilready  serving  as  volunteers.  Of  the  first  ten,  Murray  alone  remained  in 
\merica,  his  valuable  services  as  a  Government  chemist  detaining  him  here 
iespite  his  incessant  plea  for  service  abroad. 

Early  in  the  year  the  prospect  for  a  successful  season  appeared  gloomy. 
Every  club  in  the  land  had  lost  a  big  percentage  of  its  members  and  all  promi- 
nent players  were  in  some  sort  of  service,  so  that  a  repetition  of  the  Ambu- 
ance  Fund  matches  of  1917  was  out  of  the  question.  The  National  Associa- 
ion  met  the  situation  by  announcing  quite  early  in  the  year  that  championship 
itles  and  trophies  would  be  resumed.  This  proved  just  the  stimulus  required, 
or  both  players  and  public  at  once  realized  the  possibility  of  a  new  set  of 
;hampions  appearing,  and  there  was  much  speculation  as  to  whether  veterans 
)r  juniors  would  dominate.  Such  well  known  stars  as  Alexander,  Wright,  Pell, 
^iles.  Hall  and  Ward  represented  the  old  guard,  wbile  a  host  of  younger 
jlayers  had  visions  of  winning  the  national  singles  title. 

It  became  apparent  quite  early  in  the  season  that  William  Tilden,  Jr.,  of 
Philadelphia  had  to  be  reckoned  with.  Emerging  from  the  Church  Cup  com- 
jetition  undefeated,  he  took  Voshell's  measure  in  the  New  York  Tennis  Club 
ournament  and  then  annexed  the  Pennsylvania  championship  without  the  loss 
oi  a  set.  He  defeated  Garland  in  Pittsburgh  and  again  in  Chicago  at  the  Clay 
Court  championships,  where  he  also  won  a  splendidly  played  four-set  match 
Tom  Hayes.     Later  he  defeated  Murray  in  an  exhibition  match  at  Buffalo. 

The  Pacific  Coast  was  not  represented  in  any  of  the  big  tournaments. 
McLoughlin,  Johnston  and  Strachan  were  serving  in  the  navy,  while  Griffin  and 
Davis  were  in  the  army.  The  West  was  not  wholly  unrepresented,  however,  for 
Chicago  sent  its  best  known  doubles  team,  Burdick  and  Hayes,  to  compete  in 
he  national  events.  It  was  Hayes'  misfortune  to  turn  an  ankle  on  the  first  day 
)f  practice,  thus  losing  his  team  whatever  chance  of  success  it  may  have  had. 

The  national  doubles  at  Longw6od  was  the  first  meeting  held  under  the  new 
system,  the  sectional  and  preliminary  doubles  and  the  challenge  round  having 
jeen  done  away  with.  Tilden  and  Richards  won  the  title  from  Alexander  and 
iV^right  in  a  final  five-set  match  that  was  at  times  both  thrilling  and  spec- 
acular.  The  winners  had  given  an  indication  of  their  quality  by  defeating 
'rving  Wright  and  Harry  Johnson  in  the  first  round.  With  such  ease  was  this 
iccomplished  that  any  disposition  to  regard  them  lightly  was  at  once  dispelled. 
\.  hard  tussle  with  Niles  and  Pell  brought  Tilden  and  Richards  to  the  final, 
(vhere  their  opponents,  Alexander  and  Wright,  were  looked  upon  as  almost 
;ertain  winners.  -The  latter  had  had  a  hard  tussle  with  Kumagae  and  Taylor, 
Dut  their  easy  victory  over  Hayes  and  Burdick  in  the  semi-finals  found  them 
'resh  and  confident  of  winning  the  championship.  Richards  now  justified  his 
Drevious  victories  by  again  playing  sound  tennis.  The  match  went  to  five  sets, 
*hen  the  younger  pair  won  in  a  final  burst  of  speed  in  which  Tilden,  who  had 
dl  along  done  more  than  half  the  work  for  his  side,  was  fully  supported  by 
lis  partner.  So  a  new  national  champion,  a  lad  of  sixteen,  was  added  to  the 
ist  of  famous  American  players.     Tilden's  stock  now  rose  higher  than  ever. 


WILLIAM    M.    JOHNSTON. 

San  Francisco. 

National  Champion,  1915. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  23 

With  the  exception  of  Alexander's  indoor  win  over  him  prior  to  the  opening 
of  the  grass  season,  he  could  show  an  unbroken  record  of  victories  including 
two  national  titles,  the  doubles  and  the  clay  court.  Could  he  win  the  third 
and  richest  prize,  the  national  singles?  The  two  men  most  to  be  feared  were 
Kumagae  and  Murray. 

When  Kumagae  returned  unexpectedly  to  America  in  July,  all  tennis  fans 
recalled  that  he  had  been  ranked  fifth  in  1916,  and  fear  was  openly  expressed 
that  the  national  title  would  go  to  Japan.  This  menace  of  a  foreign  title- 
holder  was  more  than  Lindley  Murray  could  stand  and  was  the  deciding  factor 
in  causing  his  re-entry  into  the  tennis  world.  Unwilling  to  play  merely  for  the 
personal  honor  of  winning  a  national  championship,  he  felt  it  to  be  his  duty  to 
his  old  comrades  of  the  first  ten,  in  service  abroad,  to  defend  his  country 
from  this  invader  during  their  absence;  he  would  serve  in  the  home  campaign 
if  unable  to  do  so  in  the  one  abroad.  With  the  singles  championship  but  a 
fortnight  away,  he  had  little  time  for  preparation.  Always  in  perfect  physical 
condition,  his  chief  concern  was  lack  of  practice. 

At  the  Southampton  tournament,  always  played  just  before  the  national 
championships  and  considered  to  be  the  most  reliable  barometer  for  the  rough 
passage  of  Forest  Hills,  Tilden  won  from  Murray  in  straight  sets.  He  now 
became  the  favorite  for  the  national  title.  Before  the  great  day  arrived,  when 
ihey  met  in  the  finals,  each  had  had  his  escapes  from  disaster;  Niles  had 
taken  Murray  through  four  hard  sets  and  Alexander  had  carried  him  to  five, 
while  Tilden  had  dropped  two  sets  to  Hall,  the  victor  of  Hayes. 

The  great  match  proved  that  Murray  had  found  himself.  He  descended  upon 
the  Philadelphian  like  a  whirlwind,  smothering  him  in  straight  sets.  Had 
Tilden  won  the  third  set,  which  he  lost  at  5/7,  he  might  have  gone  on  to  vic- 
tory, Murray's  severe  net  game  being  difficult  to  maintain  during  five  sets.  But 
the  victor  was  not  to  be  denied  and  his  tempestuous  attack  combined  with  his 
improved  ground  strokes,  carried  him  through  to  a  straight-set  win.  It  must 
be  said  in  fairness  to  Tilden  that  he  was  far  from  well  at  the  time  of  the 
match. 

Miss  Molla  Bjurstedt  of  Norway  and  New  York  won  the  thirty-first  annual 
women's  championship  by  defeating  Miss  Eleanor  Goss  in  the  challenge  round. 
She  thus  brackets  her  name  with  other  three-lime  winners — Miss  Anderson, 
Miss  Moore,  Miss  Hotchkiss  and  Miss  Browne.  Paired  with  her  countrywoman, 
Mrs.  J.  Rogge,  she  lost  the  national  doubles  to  Miss  Goss  and  Miss  Zinder- 
stein  by  a  close  margin,  and  the  mixed  doubles  with  Fred  Alexander  to  Mrs. 
Wightman  and  Irving  Wright.  America  owes  a  debt  or  gratitude  to  this  Nor- 
wegian girl  who  has  so  consistently  and  cheerfully  given  her  services  through- 
out the  war  in  many  cities  of  the  East  and  West  in  exhibition  matches  for  the 
benefit  of  our  soldiers.  Her  sensational  series  of  matches  with  Miss  Browne  in 
1917  will  be  long  remembered,  while  her  willingness  to  travel  hundreds  of 
miles  to  aid  in  raising  funds  by  her  play  evinces  a  spirit  that  is  gratefully 
recognized  throughout  the  tennis  world. 

When  the  officers  of  the  National  Association  resumed  the  practice  of  giving 
trophies  and  titles,  they  made  a  special  plea  for  the  encouragement  of  tennis 
among  boys  and  juniors.  Acting-President  Julian  S.  Myrick,  whose  whole- 
hearted devotion  to  tennis  has  done  so  much  to  bring  about  a  closer  fellow- 
ship between  players  all  over  the  country,  had  given  much  time  and  thought 
to  the  improvement  of  the  game  among  the  younger  element.  Over  fifty 
special    tournaments    throughout    the    country    were    arranged    for    boys    and

juniors;  to  these  were  added  for  the  first  time  several  girls'  meetings,  includ- 
ing the  first  national  girls'  championship  held  in  conjunction  with  the  national 
women's  championship  at  Philadelphia.  The  girls'  singles  was  won  by  Miss 
Katherine  Porter.  Vice-President  Myrick  was  in  the  chair  and  the  match  was 
conducted  in  impressive  style  with  the  full  quota  of  linesmen,  as  befits  a 
national  event.  Vincent  Richards  won  the  national  boys'  title  by  a  victory 
over  A.  Bassford,  3d,  while  Harold  Taylor  became  junior  champion,  defeating 
John  Hennessey  of  Indianapolis  in  the  final. 

Not  to  be  outdone  by  the  youngsters,  the  older  element  staged  two  tourna- 
ments, the  veterans'  and  the  fathers'  and  sons'  national  championships.  The 
former  event  was  won  by  Ross  Burchard,  whose  unexpected  death  shortly 
afterward  is  a  loss  to  the  tennis  world.  The  latter  tournament,  which  suffered 
heavily  from  defaults,  fell  to  Alfred  H.  Chapin,  senior  and  junior,  of  Spring- 
field, Mass. 

Considerable  discussion  arose  as  to  whether  Murray  or  Tilden  should  be 
ranked  No.  1,  since  each  had  gained  a  victory  over  the  other;  but  Murray's 
decisive  win  in  the  national  singles  decided  the  question  in  his  favor.  Tilden 
easily  came  second,  while  Alexander's  consistent  play  throughout  the  season 
earned  for  this  hard-working  veteran  the  third  place.  Hall's  five-set  win  over 
Hayes  at  Forest  Hills  made  him  fourth,  Hayes  following.  Niles  came  sixth, 
while  Kumagae  dropped  from  fifth  to  seventh.  Garland  and  Voshell,  eighth 
and  ninth,  respectively,  while  placed  near  the  end  of  the  list,  are  young  enough 
to  look  forward  with  confidence  to  bettering  their  positions.  Pell  of  the 
famous  backhand  is  tenth  man,  just  beating  Burdick  of  Chicago  for  this  place. 

In  1917  the  revenue  from  all  tournaments  was  donated  to  the  Red  Cross,  but 
this  organization  having  been  supplied  with  ample  funds  by  the  public,  the 
National  Association  in  1918  directed  that  all  revenues  from  clubs  be  applied 
to  the  War  Department  Fund  for  Soldiers'  Training  Gamp  Activities,  in  order 
that  interest  in  sports  might  be  maintained  in  army  camps.  The  Red  Cross 
was  not  entirely  overlooked;  one  day  was  set  apart  for  special  tournaments  to 
be  played  in  tvery  club  in  the  land  in  aid  of  this  splendid  organization. 

With  the  sudden  cessation  of  war  came  the  realization  that  1919  would  wit- 
ness a  great  year  in  tennis.  To  the  many  new  figures  added  to  the  tennis 
world  in  1918,  would  come  the  old  champions  back  from  the  war.  Interest  in 
the  game  had  been  increased,  thanks  to  the  wise  administration  of  those 
remaining  at  home,  and  all  present  indications  are  that  1919  will  become,  in 
point  of  numbers,  the  greatest  year  in  the  history  of  the  game.  It  will  be 
intensely  interesting  to  witness  the  coming  struggle  between  the  old  forces  and 
the  new.  Which  will  conquer?  Will  Williams  and  Johnston  meet  in  the  finals 
once  more?  Will  McLoughlin  compete  or  will  Tilden  triumph  over  the  old 
first  ten  men?  All  await  the  result  with  the  keenest  expectation.  We  are 
indeed  fortunate  to  have  lost  no  Wilding  in  this  war,  and  with  the  present 
undoubted  upward  trend  of  tennis  we  should  be  well  equipped  in  another  year 
to  wrest  the  Davis  Cup  from  Australasia.  All  efforts  in  19l9  must  bend  toward 
this  object.

Lawn  Tennis  in  En^iland 

By  Samuel  Hardy. 

At  the  outbreak  of  the  war,  all  tournaments  were  cancelled  and  practically 
every  able-bodied  tennis  player  in  the  country  entered  the  service.  Those  few 
who  were  rejected  because  of  disability,  entered  Government  service  in  some 
capacity  and  in  their  leisure  moments  naturally  turned  to  their  favorite  sport. 

Public  feeling  at  this  time  was  so  strongly  opposed  to  sport  of  any  descrip- 
tion, that  many  a  player  felt  constrained  to  slink  along  the  street  with  his 
racket  carefully  tucked  under  his  coat,  so  that  he  might  escape  the  vigilant  eye 
of  some  patriotic  female  who  would  very  likely  ask  him  why  he  was  content  to 
play  such  a  silly  game  when  he  might  be  earning  the  King's  shilling. 

While  the  spirit  of  the  country  was,  wisely  or  unwisely,  against  tournaments, 
there  was  much  tennis  played  in  an  unobtrusive  way.  Of  all  England's  stand- 
ard games,  none  is  so  economical  of  both  time  and  space,  and  many  a  busy 
man  is  indebted  to  the  game  for  needed  exercise  otherwise  unprocurable.  Hard 
courts  require  little  attention,  and  as  for  grass,  the  courts  were  there  when  the 
players  had  leisure,  and  what  was  a  bunker  more  or  less  in  war  time? 

The  famous  All  England  Club  at  Wimbledon  kept  a  few  grass  courts  going 
during  the  season,  as  did  most  of  the  clubs  throughout  the  country;  but  the 
bulk  of  the  play  was  at  Queen's  Club,  London.  Officers  returning  from  the 
front  on  leave  found  themselves  welcome,  whatever  their  nationality,  and  kept 
themselves  fit  by  play  either  indoors  or  on  grass.  It  was  not  long,  therefore, 
before  Government  officials  began  to  look  upon  tennis  more  favorably,  some  of 
them  even  proclaiming  it  an  admirable  war  game. 

Among  those  who  kept  alive  the  spirit  of  tennis,  there  was  no  more  faithful 
worker  than  George  Caridia,  who  assumed  the  heavy  duties  of  honorable  secre- 
tary of  the  All  England  Club  in  place  of  George  Hillyard,  who,  with  his  son, 
had  entered  the  army  at  the  outbreak  of  hostilities.  Ritchie,  Gore,  Barrett  and 
Dixon,  all  old  Davis  Cup  men,  played  as  often  as  occasion  permitted,  while 
Davson,  Queen's  Club  champion,  Greville,  Simond,  Fowler,  Myers,  Watt  and 
others  lent  their  service  in  exhibition  matches  played  for  patriotic  purposes. 

Quite  the  most  important  tennis  meeting  during  the  war  was  held  at  Queen's 
Club  on  August  25,  1918,  W.  A.  Earned  heading  several  noted  American 
players.  It  was  a  Red  Cross  affair.  Army  versus  Navy,  and  it  T^as  attended  by 
many  eminent  men,  including  Admiral  Sims  and  General  Biddle. 

The  Army  won  by  five  matches  to  four,  but  the  heroes  of  the  day  were  a 
young  Navy  pair  from  this  country — Ensign  Clifton  B.  Herd  and  Lieutenant 
Francis  T.  Hunter — who  won  all  three  of  their  matches,  impressing  the  critics 
most  favorably.  The  Times  speaks  of  them,  and  of  Lieutenant  P.  H.  Glover, 
R.N.,  as  "young  players  of  the  highest  promise,  who  might  in  the  future  aspire 
to  championship  honors."  The  countries  represented  in  the  play  were  England, 
Australia,  South  Africa,  Canada  and  the  United  States. 

The  Navy  team  included  besides  Hunter,  Herd  and  Glover,  Staff  Surgeon 
Grieg,  Lieutenant  Gordon  Cleather  and  Lieutenant  P.-  lA.  Davson,  while  Major 
Arthur  H.  Lowe  joined  Earned  in  the  doubles  for  the  Army  side,  which  also 
comprised  Colonel  H.  G.  Mayes  of  the  Canadian  Davis  Cup  team  of  1913; 
Colonel  A.  R.  F.  Kingscote,  a  member  of  Britain's  team  in  1914;  Captain  C. 
C.  Le  Sueur  of  South  Africa,  ana  P.  O'Hara  Wood  of  Australia.

American  Officers'  A.  E.  F.  Cliampionships 
Cannes,  France 

By  Harry  L.  Graff. 

Before  describing  the  most  remarkable  and  what  a  great  many  consider  the 
greatest  tennis  tournament  ever  played,  namely,  the  American  officers'  tennis 
tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  A.E.F.,  which  started  February  19, 
1919,  at  Cannes,  France,  it  will  be  necessary  for  me  to  explain  how  it  became 
possible  to  get  the  pick  of  the  players  and  assemble  them  at  the  same  time  at 
this  famous  spot  on  the  Riviera. 

Immediately  after  the  signing  of  the  armistice  on  November  11,  it  became  a 
great  problem  to  the  General  Staff  as  to  just  how  they  were  going  to  handle 
over  2,000,000  American  soldiers  and  officers,  who  before  the  armistice  were 
constantly  keyed  up  to  a  high  pitch  by  continuous  fighting,  drilling,  and  with 
the  one  idea  in  every  man's  mind  of  "lick  the  Hun."  Naturally  enough,  imme- 
diately after  the  signing  of  the  armistice,  the  reaction  set  in — the  men  became 
fretful,  the  tremendous  routine  of  continuous  drill  and  preparation  was  no 
longer  necessary,  and  while  before  the  boys  were  only  too  glad  to  work  them- 
selves to  a  finish,  now  everything  of  this  nature  became  hateful  to  them. 

Fighting  having  stopped  entirely  and,  due  to  the  above  condition,  military 
maneuvers  having  been  reduced  to  a  few  hours  each  day,  the  question  arose. 
What  are  we  going  to  do  with  this  idle  timfe  and  at  the  same  time  keep  the 
men  fit  and  their  minds  busy? 

Into  this  breach  stepped  the  man  of  the  hour  in  France,  Colonel  Wait  C. 
Johnson,  one  of  the  General  Staff  and  Chief  Intelligence  Officer  of  the  Army. 
He  had  been  studying  this  question  for  a  long  time  before  the  armistice  in 
anticipation  of  just  such  a  state  of  affairs,  and  when  the  time  came  he  was 
there  with  the  most  ambitious  and  comprehensive  programme  of  athletics  prob- 
ably ever  formulated.  This  programme  was  so  enormous  that  every  man  in  the 
A.E.F.  physically  fit  was  to  be  busy  at  some  kind  of  play.  When  this  plan 
was  submitted  to  General  Pershing,  he  unqualifiedly  approved  of  same  and 
immediately  appointed  Colonel  Johnson  chief  athletic  officer  of  the  A.E.F.,  with 
instructions  to  put  it  through  in  conjunction  with  the  Y.M.C.A.  athletic 
department. 

Immediately  thereafter  Colonel  Johnson  met  with  the  Y.M.C.A.  athletic 
directors  at  Tremblay  and  outlined  his  plans.  Of  the  125  present,  all  trained 
experts  in  athletics  and  numbering  in  their  midst  some  of  the  greatest  athletes 
we  have  ever  had,  each  and  every  one  signified  his  willingness  to  do  his  utmost 
in  putting  over  this  programme.  One  of  the  first  events  to  be  decided  was  the 
officers'  tennis  championship. 

In  the  Army  of  Occupation  and  intermediate  sector,  each  division  was  to  be 
represented  by  four  players,  two  from  each  corps  and  each  army  headquarters. 
The  S.O.S.  was  divided  into  areas,  each  area  being  allowed  four  represent- 
atives, with  two  for  each  headquarters. 

Where  weather  permitted,  players  were  selected  by  elimination,  otherwise  by 
selection.  The  eliminations  and  selections  took  place  the  latter  part  of  Jan- 
uary and  orders  were  sent  from  General  Headquarters  at  Chaumont  to  each 
unit  ordering  the  successful  candidates  to  report  at  Cannes  by  February  16. 
Needless  to  say,  only  death  itself  could  prevent  the  men  from  obeying  this 
order.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  31 

Cannes,  the  Pearl  of  the  Riviera,  was  selected  as  the  setting  for  this  famous 
tournament  on  account  of  its  beauty,  wonderful  climate,  elegance  and  aristo- 
cratic grace,  the  magnificent  Hotel  Carlton,  and  last,  but  not  least,  its  two 
famous  tennis  clubs,  the  Carlton  and  Cannes,  the  object  being  to  divert  the 
minds  of  the  men  entirely  from  the  past  few  months  and  take  them  into 
another  world — a  world  of  beauty  and  pleasure. 

The  writer,  who  was  the  "Y"  athletic  director  attached  to  Colonel  Johnson  as 
his  aide  to  do  the  actual  handling  of  the  tournament,  was  ordered  to  Cannes, 
arriving  there  on  February  9. 

Arrangements  were  made  for  the  accommodation  of  all  officers  at  the  Carlton 
Hotel,  and  the  Carlton  and  Cannes  clubs  immediately  offered  their  beautiful 
courts,  numbering  thirteen  in  all.  for  practice  purposes  and  for  the  actual 
conduct  of  the  tournament.  The  Red  Cross  and  the  Y.M.C.A.,  controlling  five 
more  courts  between  them,  also  offered  theirs. 

These  offers  were  accepted,  and  as  arrangements  already  had  been  completed 
for  Spalding  (who  I  might  state  right  here  went  out  of  their  way  to  do 
everything  to  help  us  out)  to  open  a  fully  equipped  tennis  store  in  Cannes, 
everything  was  in  readiness  by  the  time  the  first  of  the  players  arrived. 

The  arrivals  began  on  February  12  and  continued  steadily  until  February  16, 
when  188  entries  were  recorded,  representing  forty-four  States,  the  majority 
players  of  note  from  their  respective  States  and  organizations  and  numbering 
in  their  midst  such  well  known  players  of  national  and  international  reputa- 
tion as  Williams,  Larned,  Davis,  Wrenn,  Washburn,  Mathey,  Breck  and  Watters. 

Practice  naturally  started  as  soon  as  the  men  began  to  arrive,  but  by  Feb- 
ruary 16,  due  to  the  large  entry  list  and  the  limited  number  of  courts,  it 
became  necessary  to  issue  orders  for  practice.  This  gave  each  man  a  speci- 
fied court  and  hour  each  day,  with  no  advantage  to  anyone,  and  the  practice 
programme  was  so  worked  out  that  men  who  were  entered  together  in  the 
doubles  were  placed  together  during  practice  periods. 

From  the  writer's  viewpoint  it  was  most  remarkable  with  what  rapidity  these 
men,  who  had  not  handled  a  racket  in  from  one  to  three  years,  began  round- 
ing into  form.  Of  course,  the  first  day  they  were  very  careful;  but  by  the 
third  day  they  were  using  the  severe  service,  putting  the  real  sting  into  the 
ball  on  their  ground  strokes,  and  by  the  19th  everyone  had  his  eye  on  the  ball. 

It  must  be  mentioned  here  that  as  soon  as  the  public  got  the  news  through 
the  press  that  Cannes  was  the  favored  spot,  the  hotels  began  to  fill  with 
notables  of  all  nationalities,  including  a  great  many  English,  Canadian  and 
Australian  officers,  who  were  well  repaid  for  their  long  journey. 

On  February  19,  sharp  at  9  A.  M.,  the  singles  began,  Colonel  Johnson  acting 
as  manager  of  ihe  Carlton  Club,  and  the  writer  in  the  same  capacity  at  the 
Cannes  Club.  There  also  was  an  umpire  for  each  court.  Orders  were  issued 
the  night  before  to  the  effect  that  all  officers  must  report  on  time  for  their 
matches.  The  matches  were  run  off  with  precision  and  with  no  unnecessary 
delay,  and  at  five  o'clock,  when  the  results  were  posted  in  the  tennis  office  at 
the  hotel,  it  was  found  that,  as  planned,  we  had  disposed  of  ninety-four 
matches. 

That  evening  at  the  dance  given  by  the  Y.M.C.A.  Officers'  Club,  the  men 
began  to  realize  that  they  were  really  going  to  have  a  wonderful  time.  Not 
only  were  they  enjoying  themselves  at  their  favorite  game  on  magnificent 
courts,  but  they  had  scores  of  real  pretty  American  girls  to  dance  with.  As 
Colonel  Johnson  had  made  the  statement  that  the  tournament  would  be  played

off  in  good  weather  and  on  dry  courts  if  it  took  a  year  to  do  it,  the  desire  for 
rain  became  very  pronounced,  and  the  weather  man  being  a  good  fellow  for 
the  time  being,  rain  it  did  for  two  solid  days,  with  the  players  improving 
their  footwork  on  the  polished  hardwood  floor  of  the  club  with  the  assistance 
of  two  military  bands. 

Play  was  again  resumed  on  Washington's  Birthday,  the  thirteen  courts  of 
the  two  clubs  being  used.  Forty-seven  matches  were  played,  which  brought 
us  into  the  third  round. 

With  close  attention  to  the  play  and  form  displayed,  it  became  quite  evident 
that,  barring  reversal,  Williams,  Washburn,  Mathey,  Breck,  Watters,  Davis, 
Dell,  Payne  and  Van  Deventer  would  be  fighting  it  out  for  premier  honors. 

H.  C.  Breck  sprung  a  surprise  on  those  who  had  never  seen  him  play  by 
his  defeat  of  Douglas  Watters,  the  Southern  champion,  and  from  then  on  he 
was  looked  upon  by  many  as  the  dark  horse.  He  next  disposed  of  Colonel 
Dwight  F.  Davis,  who  had  been  playing  remarkably  good  tennis,  but  whose 
backcourt  game  could  not  stand  against  the  net  play  of  this  Californian. 

However,  he  met  his  Waterloo  at  the  hands  of  R.  Norris  Williams,  2d,  after 
a  spirited  match. 

Mathey,  who  had  been  playing  excellent  tennis,  was  figured  to  give  Wash- 
burn a  hard  tussle.  Mathey  elected  to  take  the  net  and  Washburn,  whose 
whip  stroke  was  working  perfectly,  was  content  to  play  the  back  court.  His 
judgment  proved  to  be  correct,  as  he  was  constantly  able  to  pass  Mathey  on 
the  side  lines,  breaking  his  game  all  up  and  winning  in  straight  sets. 

The  Van  Deventer-Dell  match  went  the  full  limit  before  Van  Deventer  finally 
pulled  out  the  winner. 

Payne  having  disposed  of  Lamed,  in  his  following  match  with  Washburn 
decided  to  play  him  at  his  own  game — ^the  base  line — and  consequently  this 
match  was  one  of  the  best,  from  the  spectators'  point  of  view,  in  the  whole 
tournament.  For  a  short  time  it  looked  as  though  Washburn  was  going  to 
have  his  hands  full  to  come  out  on  the  winning  end,  but  his  wonderful  and 
continued  sureness  of  stroke  finally  upset  Payne  and  he  came  through  to  victory. 

This  brought  Williams  and  Washburn  into  the  final.  In  this  match  Williams 
played  such  a  diversified  game,  with  so  many  changes  of  pace,  that  he  upset 
Washburn's  game  completely  and  won  in  straight  sets.  In  the  doubles, 
Williams  and  Washburn,  who  were  teamed  together,  came  through  without 
being  extended. 

Cups  were  presented  to  the  winners  and  runners-up  by  the  Y.M.C.A.,  and 
Williams  was  presented  with  a  beautiful  trophy  by  the  City  of  Cannes. 

Play  was  finished  on  March  3,  and  on  the  4th  everyone  started  on  the 
return  journey  to  their  organizations,  the  consensus  of  opinion  being,  as  the 
majority  expressed  it,  "We  had  the  best  time  of  our  lives."

SfALiDlNG'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNDAU  35 

Publicity  for  Tennis  Tournaments 

By  E.  B.  Moss, 
President  National  Association  of  Lawn  Tennis  Writers. 

While  tennis  is  played  in  all  parts  of  the  country  and  may  be  considered 
one  of  America's  major  sports,  there  are  still  sections  where  judicious  pub- 
licity will  materially  advance  the  interest  in  and  of  the  game. 

The  work  involved  is  not  necessarily  arduous,  but  it  requires  a  carefully 
planned  campaign,  with  co-operation  among  members  of  various  clubs  within 
a  given  area.  Where  several  clubs  combine  in  such  a  project  and  plan  tour- 
naments for  club  members  and  interclub  matches  for  various  classes,  interest 
can  be  quickly  aroused  and  sustained  throughout  the  entire  season. 

Such  a  plan  will  provide  the  material  for  a  publicity  campaign.  The  next 
step  requires  the  appointment  of  at  least  one  member  in  each  club  who  will 
devote  an  occasional  hour  during  the  week  to  preparing  matter  for  distribu- 
tion among  the  local  newspapers.  The  following  suggestions  are  offered  in 
this  connection  with  the  idea  of  simplifying  this  work  and  bringing  about 
co-operation  between  the  club  publicity  member  and  the  newspapers. 

Before  sending  copy  to  the  newspapers,  it  has  proved  a  good  plan  to  can- 
vass local  publications  and  ascertain  which  day  of  the  week  is  the  most  suit- 
able for  publication.  As  a  rule,  it  will  be  found  that  morning  papers  will 
have  more  space  available  on  the  sport  page  on  Monday.  Evening  papers  will 
generally  use  such  matter  on  either  Saturday  or  Monday. 

Copy  should  be  neatly  typewritten  on  one  side  of  the  sheet  only,  in  direct 
and  concise  form.  Advance  notices  of  tournaments  giving  the  conditions  of 
play,  names  of  members  to  compete,  their  handicaps,  time  and  place  of 
matches,  arrangement  for  accommodating  spectators,  etc.,  will  find  ready 
acceptance.  The  result  of  such  contests,  with  scores  and  an  occasional 
description  of  the  feature  matches,  can  be  used  as  a  foUow-up.  Similar 
methods  can  be  used  for  the  distribution  of  club  tennis  news,  such  as  elec- 
tions, increase  in  membership,  etc. 

It  is  advisable,  although  not  necessary,  to  have  a  distinctive  envelope  and 
papers  for  this  weekly  copy,  which  should  be  addressed  to  the  sport  editor  of 
the  different  papers  by  name.  After  a  short  time  he  will,  as  a  rule,  look  for 
the  weekly  contribution  and  reserve  space  for  the  same.  Different  stories 
should  be  sent  to  morning  and  afternoon  papers  in  order  that  there  may  not 
be  a  reprint  of  identical  matter  in  editions  within  the  same  twenty-four  hours. 

These  suggestions  are  intended  to  merely  outline  the  methods  whereby  much 
desirable  publicity  may  be  secured  and  must  be  changed  according  to  the 
requirements  or  other  conditions  of  any  given  locality.  While  it  is  generally 
the  case  that  all  tournaments  for  local  championships  or  matches  of  equal 
importance  are  covered  by  regular  assigned  reporters,  the  time  of  these  writ- 
ers is,  as  a  rule,  considered  too  valuable  to  permit  their  making  daily  or 
weekly  rounds  of  the  tennis  clubs  for  the  more  prosaic  but  none  the  less 
interesting  matter  which  is  always  available. 

In  sending  the  accounts  of  matches  to  the  papers,  be  sure  to  include  the 
names  of  those  who  serve  in  various  official  capacities  at  a  match,  such  as 
umpire,  linesmen,  etc.  Competent  officials  are  a  big  factor  in  the  success  of 
any  tournament  and  the  publication  of  their  names  wiU  be  an  act  of  courtesy 
on  the  part  of  the  management  in  recognition  for  their  services.

Handicap  Tournaments  Provide  Close  Matches 

By  Samuel  Hardy. 

In  the  handicap  tournament,  the  "dub"  comes  into  his  own;  he  is  placed  on 
an  equality  with  the  club  champion  if  both  are  correctly  handicapped,  and 
has  an  even  chance  of  winning.  The  better  player  also  benefits,  as  the  advan- 
tage of  careful  play  is  brought  home  to  him. 

Anyone  can  learn  in  a  very  few  minutes  how  to  handicap  a  tournament  and 
how  to  score  a  handicap  match.  It  is  the  purpose  of  this  article  to  show  that 
the  novice  need  fear  no  such  expressions  as  "owe  half  thirty"  or  "plus  2/6." 

Modern  handicapping  consists  of  one  or  more  points  either  received  or  owed 
in  each  six  games  played,  and  are  designated  as  +  (received)  or  —  (owed). 
We  will  first  deal  with  the  received  odds,  and  assume  that  A,  the  stronger 
player,  gives  B,  the  weaker,  a  handicap  of  15.  This  means  that  B  receives 
one  point,  the  first  in  each  game,  and  has  one  point  less  to  make  than  his 
opponent.  If  A  were  serving,  the  score  at  the  beginning  of  the  game  would 
be  love-15,  but  he  would  start  serving  from  the  right-hand  court  as  usual.  Now 
suppose  that  A  finds  that  he  cannot  give  B  so  large  a  handicap;  what  shall 
he  do?  The  "Sixths  System"  of  handicapping  was  devised  to  take  care  of 
just  such  a  case.  Instead  of  giving  a  point  (15)  every  game,  he  may  give  it 
in  only  five  out  of  six  games  (5/6),  or  in  four  games  out  of  six  (4/6),  and  so 
on  down  to  one  game  in  every  six   (1/6). 

RECEIVED   ODDS.  Ist  Game.    2d  Game.    3d  Game.    4th  Game.    5th  Game.    6th  Game. 

1-6  of  15 0  15  0  0  0  0 

2-6  of  15 0  15  0  15  0  0

5-6  of  15 0  15  15  15  15  15 

The  accompanying  schedule  of  received  odds  shows  just  when  these  points 
are  to  be  taken.  Note  that  a  player  receiving  1/6  always  takes  the  point  at 
the  beginning  of  the  second  of  each  series  of  six  games,  or,  in  other  words, 
on  the  second,  eighth,  fourteenth,  etc.,  games  of  the  set,  and  that  if  he  receives 
2/6  he  takes  the  points  in  the  second  and  foirrth  games  of  each  six.  A 
handicap  of  3/6  is  known  as  "half  15,"  one  point  being  taken  every  alternate 
game.  "Half  30"  means  15  received  in  the  first  game,  30  in  the  second,  15  in 
the  third,  30  in  the  foiurth,  and  so  on.  "Half  40"  means  30  in  the  first  game, 
40  in  the  next,  and  so  on. 

When  A  is  so  far  the  superior  of  B  that  he  can  give  him  30  and  still  win 
omfortably,  B's  handicap  is  not  increased  to  "half  40"  or  to  40,  as  B  might 
then  win  a  game  by  getting  a  single  point.  Instead,  A  is  placed  below  scratch 
and  must  win  one  or  more  extra  points  before  he  arrives  at  scratch,  while  B 
still  has  two  points  to  make.  For  example,  if  A,  serving  to  B,  owes  15  and 
gives  30,  the  score  prior  to  the  play  is  "owe  15, 30,"  but  if  B  serves  it  is  "30,  owe 
15."  Should  A,  serving,  win  the  first  point,  the  score  is  "love,  30,"  and  he  has 
made  up  what  he  owes.     If  A  loses  the  first  point  the  score  is  "owe  15,  40." 

It  was  found  that  when  B  received  a  handicap  greater  than  30,  luck  played 
too  prominent  a  part  in  the  game,  since  a  single  bad  bounce,  a  net  cord,  or  a 
fluke  won  too  many  games.  Odds  of  40  are  too  discouraging  to  the  average 
good  player,  who  is  then  obliged  to  play  too  cautiously  to  enjoy  the  match. 
This  is  not  the  case  when  he  owes  odds,  for  while  he  has  more  points  to  make 
to  score  a  game,  his  opponent  must  always  make  at  least  two  points.

5-6  of  15 15  0  15  15  15  15 

An  important  point  to  note  is  that  fractional  owed  odds  begin  in  the  first 
game,  never  in  the  second.  Owed  odds  may  be  divided  into  sixths  in  exactly 
the  same  manner  as  received  odds.  If  A  owes  B  1/6  he  must  win  one  extra 
point  in  every  six  games.  In  other  words,  he  "owes"  this  point,  which,  as  the 
schedule  shows,  is  owed  only  in  the  first  game.  The  score  at  the  beginning 
of  the  first,  seventh  and  thirteenth  games,  A  serving,  is  "owe  15,  love,"  but  at 
the  commencement  of  all  other  games  is  "love-all."  If  A  owes  15  1/6,  he  is 
"owe  15"  in  every  game  except  the  first,  seventh  and  thirteenth,  when  he  is 
"owe  30."  If  he  owes  15  3/6,  he  owes  30  in  tliree  games  (the  first,  the  third 
and  the  fifth)   and  15  in  the  other  three  games. 

When  two  players  are  matched,  each  receiving  odds,  there  are  two  systems 
by  which  their  handicaps  may  be  arranged.  In  one,  the  Direct  Method,  the 
better  player  starts  at  scratch,  giving  th,e  poorer  the  difference  between  the 
two  handicaps.  For  example,  C  +  2/6  is  opposed  to  D  +  5/6.  C  goes  to 
scratch,  giving  D  3/6.  The  other  system  is  known  as  the  Differential  and  is 
printed  on  page  265.  See  table  No.  1.  Here,  too,  the  better  man  plays  at 
scratch,  but  the  handicap  of  his  opponent  is  determined  in  quite  another  way. 
Suppose  A  +  15  plays  B  +  30,  A  does  not  give  B  15,  but  15.1,  as  the  table 
shows.  Look  along  the  top  column  from  left  to  right  until  you  come  to  the 
handicap  for  which  you  are  looking,  which  in  this  case  is  15,  and  comes  in 
column  6.  Now  drop  your  eye  down  to  the  bottom  of  column  6  and  run  along 
to  the  right  until  you  come  to  the  column  of  which  30,  your  other  handicap, 
is  the  head,  namely,  column  12.  At  the  intersection  of  the  two  columns  the 
figures  15.1  are  printed,  and  this  is  the  handicap  A  gives  B.  The  Sixths  Sys- 
tem is  followed,  so  15.1  means  15  and  one-sixth,  not  15  and  one-tenth  as  in 
the  decimal  system. 

Owed  odds  may  also  be  figured  by  either,  system.  In  the  Direct  Method, 
when  two  players  owe  odds,  the  one  owing  the  lesser  odds  advances  to  scratch, 
his  opponent  owing  him  the  difference  between  the  two  handicaps.  For 
instance,  if  E,  "owe  15,"  plays  F,  "owe  2/6,"  F  plays  at  scratch,  and  E  owes 
4/6.  Table  No.  2  on  page  266  shows  how  the  owed  odds  are  figured  accord- 
ing to  the  Differential  System.  Follow  the  same  method  as  when  determining 
the  handicap  in  received  odds.  For  instance,  if  E,  "owe  15,"  plays  F,  "'owe 
2/6,"  find  the  column  headed  by  the  smaller  odds,  2/6,  which  is  column  2. 
Follow  along  the  bottom  of  this  to  the  right  until  you  reach  the  "owe  15" 
column  (No.  6)  and  at  the  intersection  of  the  two  columns  is  the  odds  E 
owes  F,  or  3/6  of  15. 

Handicapping  must  be  left  to  the  discretion  of  the  club's  handicap  commit- 
tee. Mistakes  are  bound  to  occur  at  the  first  attempt,  but  one  or  two  trials 
produce  many  close  matches.  Start  with  your  poorest  player,  placing  him  at 
plus  30,  and  work  toward  scratch  by  sixths,  giving  the  next  best  player  15  5/6, 
the  next  15  4/6,  and  so  on.  Usually  your  Class  B  man  plays  at  or  near  scratch, 
only  the  Class  A  man  owing  odds.  Do  not  hesitate  to  place  a  really  good 
player  far  below  scratch,  say  "owe  30"  or  "owe  40,"  and  sometimes  even  lower.

National  Championships 

After  a  lapse  of  one  year — in  which  a  patriotic  tournament  but  no  cham- 
pionship was  scheduled — the  annual  competition  for  the  singles  championship 
of  the  United  States,  the  thirty-seventh  under  the  auspices  of  the  U.S.N.L.T.A., 
was  held  on  the  courts  of  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club,  Forest  Hills,  Long 
Island,  during  the  period  August  26  to  September  3,  inclusive. 

The  interval  of  a  year  had  given  the  Association  a  chance  to  get  a  focus  on 
the  tennis  situation  in  general,  and  it  was  the  consensus  of  all  concerned — in 
which  was  included  the  viewpoint  of  the  crack  players  who  had  joined  the 
colors — that  it  would  be  for  the  best  interests  of  the  game  to  resume  the 
competition  for  the  national  championship. 

Eighty-seven  entrants  'were  scheduled  to  compete  and  the  quality  of  players 
compared  favorably  with  the  class  that  had  competed  in  pre-war  times. 

The  first  round  went  through  the  usual  elimination  incident  to  initial  play, 
with  no  upsets  of  importance.  The  feature  of  the  first  day's  play  was  an 
extraordinarily  long  contest  between  Harold  Throckmorton  and  Harold  Taylor,

Camp;   5,   Edwin  F.  Torrey ;   6,   R.   Lindley  JIurray.

the  Brooklyn  lad,  which  the  former  won  in  the  fifth  set.  The  match  took 
eighty-three  games,  totaling  503  points,  of  which  Throckmorton  got  261  and 
Taylor  242.  Throckmorton  won  43  games  to  Taylor's  39.  The  former  "record" 
for  a  lengthy  contest  was  in  the  match  between  Palmer  E.  Presbrey  and  T. 
Suffern  Tailer,  which  took  place  at  Newport  in  1880,  eighty  games  being 
played  before  the  former  won. 

Other  winners  in  the  first  day's  play  included  F.  B.  Alexander,  F.  C.  Baggs, 
T.  R.  Pell,  Beals  Wright,  Nat  Niles,  and  other  prominent  contestants  in 
championships. 

The  second  day's  play  included  another  "marathon"  or  endurance  test,  this 
time  the  Japanese  plaver  Seiichiro  Kashio  and  G.  A.  L.  Dionne  stringing  out

their  match  until  stopped  by  darkness,  with  the  score  6/1,1/9,6/^,2/2.  This 
event  consumed  over  four  hours  of  time  and  the  patience  of  the  spectators.  In 
some  of  the  rallies  the  ball  went  over  the  net  more  than  one  hundred  times 
before  a  point  was  scored. 

There  were  no  outstanding  features  of  play  in  the  second  round  and  as 
eliminations  continued  the  class  of  the  tournament  began  to  emerge,  furnish- 
ing a  topic  of  discussion  as  to  the  chances  of  the  various  players  and  their 
eventual  rating. 

The  "to  be  continued  in  our  next"  match  of  Kashio  and  Dionne  was  quickly 
settled  on  the  third  day  in  favor  of  the  Japanese,  and  the  latter,  now  imbued 
with  long  distance  propensities,  extended  Lyle  Mahan  in  another  long  drawn 
out  affair,  darkness  again  intervening  with  the  score  in  favor  of  Kashio, 
10/8,10/8,6/8,6/6. 

Some  surprises  were  uncovered  in  this  round.  Murray,  who  had  practiced 
very  little  all  year,  defeated  Pell  handily  in  straight  sets.  Walter  Merrill 
Hall  took  the  measure  of  Walter  T.  Hayes,  the  Western  crack.  The  latter's 
partner,  Ralph  Burdick,  was  the  victim  of  Nat  Niles,  and  Tilden  defeated 
Conrad  B.  Doyle  of  Washington.  F.  B.  Alexander  and  Harold  Throckmorton 
furnished  the  feature  match  of  the  day.  The  former  internationalist  started 
slowly,  while  his  young  opponent  showed  some  of  the  most  brilliant  tennis  of 
his  career.  Alexander,  however,  began  to  pick  up  in  the  third  set  and  won  it 
and  the  succeeding  two  in  true  Alexander  style. 

Thursday's  play  found  Murray  as  the  opponent  of  Aleander,  and  the  exhi- 
bition that  these  two  masters  of  the  racket  gave,  set  the  crowd  wild  as  one 
brilliant  play  succeeded  another.  Although  the  match  required  five  sets  for  a 
decision,  it  was  apparent  nevertheless  that  Murray  never  was  in  real  danger  and 
he  finished  the  match  with  a  dazzling  display,  taking  six  games  straight.  This 
was  the  second  best  match  of  the  tournament. 

Merrill  Hall  opposed  Tilden,  who  had  as  yet  been  unbeaten  during  the 
grass  season.  He  had  the  Philadelphia  player  in  a  hole,  6/3,1/6,7/5,3/2,  when 
a  torrential  rainstorm  postponed  the  match.  At  the  same  time,  on  another 
court,  Beals  Wright  was  leading  the  famous  Kumagae,  9/8,  when  the  elements 
intervened. 

The  following  day,  Friday,  found  Wright  and  Kumagae  continuing  their 
left-over  match.  The  veteran  Davis  Cup  player  carried  the  Japanese  to  five 
sets,  but  the  latter  was  not  to  be  denied,  and  won,  8/10,6/3,3/6,6/1,6/2.  Hall 
and  Tilden  also  resumed  their  match.  The  respite  had  a  good  effect  on 
Tilden,  who,  despite  the  load  that  Hall  had  hung  upon  him,  finally  won,  the 
score  being  3/6.6/1,5/7,7/5,6/1. 

The  Murray-Niles  match  was  a  pretty  one,  but,  as  in  the  case  of  Murray's 
other  opponents,  had  the  inevitable  result.  Niles  had  a  chance  to  go  to  five 
sets,  but  lost  the  opportunity  with  an  easy  ball  into  the  net. 

Two  matches  only  were  scheduled  on  Saturday.  Kumagae  disposed  of  Lyle 
Mahan,  while  Murray  and  Voshell — both  left-handers — had  it  out  in  a  stub- 
born contest,  the  former  winning,  6/4,6/3,8/6. 

The  semi-final  between  Tilden  and  Kumagae  was  played  on  Labor  Day 
before  a  fine  crowd,  which  included  a  large  number  of  the  Japanese  player's 
countrymen.  It  took  only  forty-four  minutes  for  Tilden  to  defeat  his  oppo- 
nent, a  remarkably  short  period  of  time  for  a  national  semi-final  event,  the 
score  being  6/2,6/2,6/0.  Despite  the  encouraging  presence  of  his  fellow  Nip- 
ponese, Kumagae  seemed  helpless  before  the  onslaught  of  his  rival,  who 
played  a  match  that  was  perfect  both  as  to  form  and  tactics.

September  3  saw  a  new  champion  in  the  person  of  R.  Lindley  Murray,  the 
young  chemist  of  Niagara  Falls  and  California,  who,  in  three  sets,  adminis- 
tered the  first  defeat  of  the  season  to  William  T.  Tilden,  Jr.,  of  Philadelphia. 
The  latter,  on  the  form  shown  during  the  summer,  was  generally  conceded  to 
have  the  best  chance  for  the  championship.  Murray  had  been  defeated  by 
Tilden  at  Southampton  the  previous  week  and  needed  the  period  of  the  cham- 
pionship to  tune  him  up  for  his  final  effort.  Tilden  suffered  severely  from  a 
boil  that  had  developed  on  his  foot  on  the  last  day  and  was  not  able  to  with- 
stand the  characteristic  fast  attacking  game  of  Murray,  who  was  now  at  the 
pinnacle  of  his  ability.  Tilden  fell  a  victim  in  three  straight  sets  which  took 
only  an  hour  to  play.     The  point  score:

Veterans'  Championship 

The  first  veterans'  championship,  held  in  conjunction  with  the  national  cham- 
pionsliips  on  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club's  courts,  Forest  Hills,  L.  I.,  was  a 
pronounced  success.  There  was  an  entry  list  of  twenty-eight,  and  many  good 
contests  resulted.  The  honor  of  winning  this  new  national  title  fell  to  the  lot 
of  Ross  Burchard,  long  a  member  of  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club,  and  winner 
of  the  Metropolitan  championship  in  1908.  He  came  through  to  the  final  round 
with  the  loss  of  but  one  set,  to  R.  Stevens  in  the  second  round,  and  there  met 
Fred  G.  Anderson  of  the  Kings  County  Tennis  Qub  of  Brooklyn,  N.  Y.,  former 
Canadian  champion,  and  who  stood  No.  8  in  the  1906  ranking.  Neither  player 
put  up  the  game  he  is  capable  of  in  the  final,  but  Burchard  proved  the  steadier 
and  won  out.    The  summaries:

Father  and  Son  Championship 

The  father  and  son  championship,  held  at  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club, 
Forest  Hills,  L.  I.,  did  not  attract  as  many  entries  as  expected,  but  some  good 
playing  was  presented.  The  big  surprise  of  the  competition  was  the  winning 
of  the  title  by  A.  H.  Chapin,  Sr.  and  Jr.,  who  were  not  seriously  considered. 
However,  they  outplayed  Fred  G.  Anderson  and  his  son  Fred  in  the  title  round 
in  two  interesting  sets.     The  summaries: 

DOUBLES. 
FIRST  ROUND— Dr.  Linn  Emerson  and  Son  d.  George  W.  French  and  Son,  2/6,6/3,6/4.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  51 

INational  Doubles  Championship 

In  1918  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association  eliminated  tht; 
sectional  doubles  events,  which  had  been  held  as  preliminaries  to  the  national 
title  contest,  and  substituted  an  open  doubles  championship  tournament. 

Instead,  however,  of  holding  the  doubles  in  connection  with  the  singles,  as  in 
former  years,  under  the  new  arrangement  the  doubles  was  made  a  separate 
feature,  to  be  held  at  a  time  and  place  distinct  from  the  singles. 

The  Longwood  Cricket  Club,  Boston,  was  the  scene  of  the  first  contest,  in 
1917,  but  owing  to  the  fact  that  the  tennis  events  of  that  year  were  held  as 
patriotic  tournaments,  no  transfer  of  titles  was  possible.  Last  season,  there- 
fore, when  title  contests  were  resumed,  may  be  called  the  first  year  that  actual 
doubles  title  competition  was  held  as  a  separate  tournament  from  the  national 
singles  championship. 

For  1919  the  sectional  doubles  championships  will  be  resumed,  as  in  former 
years,  and  this  season  will  see  eleven  teams,  from  as  many  sections  of  the 
country,  competing  for  the  doubles  title  at  Longwood,  beginning  August  12. 

Although,  naturally,  with  the  nation  deep  in  war  projects,  the  doubles  event 
of  last  season  did  not  compare  favorably  with  its  predecessors  of  more 
normal  times,  nevertheless  the  class  of  tennis  played  was  excellent,  even 
though  the  line  of  age  was  distinctly  marked,  for,  with  the  exception  of  those 
in  the  service  whose  duties  happened  to  be  in  the  immediate  vicinity,  the 
jmajority  of  players  were  either  of  extreme  youth  or  veterans  of  the  game. 

Probably  the  best  known  combination  was  the  Alexander-Wright  duo,  the 
old  internationalists  having  teamed  up  for  this  occasion  for  the  first  time  since 
their  quest  for  the  Davis  Cup  at  Melbourne,  in  1908.  Walter  Hayes  and  Ralph 
Burdick,  the  Middle  West  cracks,  represented  that  section,  while  the  famous 
Kumagae,  paired  with  Harold  Taylor,  the  sixteen-year-old  former  Metropolitan 
junior  champion,  gave  an  international  aspect  to  the  event.  Among  the  others, 
Nat  Niles  of  Boston  and  Theodore  Roosevelt  Pell  of  New  York,  Harry  C.  John- 
son and  Irving  C.  Wright,  Elliott  H.  Binzen  and  J.  S.  O'Boyle,  William  T. 
Tilden,  Jr.,  and  Vincent  Richards,  were  among  those  of  national  renown  who 
were  entered. 

The  elimination  brought  the  semi-finals  contestants  in  the  persons  of  Niles 
and  Pell,  Hayes  and  Burdick,  Tilden  and  Richards  and  Alexander  and  Wright. 
The  former  Davis  Cup  stars  had  quite  a  tussle  in  their  match  with  Kumagae 
and  Taylor,  the  bulk  of  the  work  falling  upon  the  Japanese,  who,  with  a 
physically  more  mature  partner,  might  have  conquered  the  veterans. 

In  the  semi-final  round  the  victory  of  Tilden  and  young  Richards  over  Niles 
and  Pell  was  of  the  sensational  order,  and  it  was  the  younger  of  the  two — 
Richards — whose  dazzling  work  was  largely  responsible.  In  the  other  bracket, 
Alexander  and  Wright,  the  Eastern  pair,  eliminated  their  rivals  from  Chicago,, 
working  with  a  smoothness  and  precision  that  they  had  not  exhibited  up  to 
this  period. 

The  final  round  was  a  triumph  for  Tilden  and  Richards — and  individually 
for  Richards — the  latter's  work  against  the  seasoned  pair  of  veterans  never 
faltering.  Never  before  had  a  boy  so  young  as  Richards  earned  a  national 
tennis  title  and,  in  view  of  the  fact  that  he  was  pitjted  against  two  such 
masters  of  the  game  as  Alexander  and  Wright,  his  accomplishment  is  all  ther 
more  remarkable".

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


Clay  Court  Championships 

The  eighth  clay  court  championships,  held  on  the  twenty-four  clay  courts 
of  the  South  Side  Tennis  Club  of  Chicago,  June  29  to  July  6,  1918,  brought 
together  stars  from  the  East,  the  West,  the  North  and  the  South,  and  pro- 
vided at  times  tennis  so  exciting  and  of  such  high  grade  that  the  tournament 
will  rank  as  one  of  the  great  successes  in  the  annals  of  Chicago  tennis. 

This  tournament  had  been  abandoned  the  previous  year  in  favor  of  a  patriotic 
event,  held  in  Cincinnati.  With  no  titles  to  play  for,  only  two  out-of-town  men, 
Garland  and  Hardy,  had  competed.  But  the  resumption  of  championship  titles 
in  1918  reacted  favorably  upon  the  entry  list.  Applications  poured  in  from  all 
sections  of  the  country,  until  the  tournament  committee  was  forced  to  limit  the 
entries  to  128.

UNITlOl)    STATES    CLAY    COURT    CHAMPIONSHIP    TROPHIES. 

Of  the  visitors,  Tilden,  Garland,  Adoue  and  Hendrick  were  considered  the 
chief  contenders  for  the  singles  title,  while  Hayes,  Hardy  and  Burdick  each  had 
his  local  supporters.  The  first  surprise  came  with  the  defeat  of  Adoue  by  Day, 
a  veteran  Chicago  player,  who  was  more  accustomed  to  the  Chicago  winds  than 
the  champion  of  the  Southwest.  Hendrick  failed  to  gauge  correctly  the  peculiar 
cut  stroke  of  Oelsner  and  went  down  in  a  close,  well  fought  match.  But  the 
real  surprise  of  the  tournament  was  Oelsner's  win  over  Burdick,  who  played 
nervously  throughout  the  match.  Oelsner,  sensing  his  advantage,  mixed  his 
chops  and  drives  with  nice  discrimination  and  thoroughly  earned  his  win. 

Both  Day  and  Oelsner,  however,  met  their  Waterloo  in  Charles  Garland, 
whose  unassuming  style  lulled  them  inta  a  false  sense  of  security.  Only  those 
who  have  struggled  against  Garland's  smooth,  machine-like  game  can  appreciate 
its  deadly  accuracy. 


WILLIAM    T.    TILDEN,    JR., 

Philadelphia. 

United    States   Clay   Court   Champion;    National   Doubles    Champion; 

Kuuner-up  National  Singles. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  63 

Hayes  in  the  meantime  had  defeated  Hardy,  who  lost  whatever  chance  of 
success  he  may  have  had  by  a  bad  fall.  Having  previously  outsteadied  Jostles 
of  St.  Louis,  Hayes  was  now  ready  for  Tilden,  who  also  had  reached  the  semi- 
finals without  extending  himself. 

The  Tilden-Hayes  match  proved  the  feature  of  the  tournament.  Tilden  had 
so  far  shown  up  as  the  best  Eastern  player  of  the  year,  whUe  Hayes  had  been 
Chicago's  leading  player  for  two  seasons.  Hayes,  who  under  all  circumstances 
can  be  depended  upon  to  give  a  good  account  of  himself,  played  true  to  form; 
but  his  utmost  efforts  and  his  fine  passing  shots,  while  they  gained  him  many 
points,  were  not  equal  to  the  all-around  game  of  Tilden.  If  Hayes  is  a  steady 
baseliner,  so  is  Tilden.  When  the  latter  elected  to  exchange  shots  in  a  base- 
line duel,  he  held  his  own  with  Hayes.  Yet  one  always  felt  that  he  was  biding 
his  time  for  a  short  return,  for  at  every  such  slip  on  the  part  of  his  opponent, 
Tilden  would  sweep  toward  the  hal\  in  a  rush  that  would  carry  him  close  to 
the  net,  where  his  enormous  reach  and  deadly  volleying  usually  won  him  the 
point.  Following  this  method  with  success  for  two  sets,  he  palpably  rested 
during  the  third,  which  Hayes  won  at  6/1.  The  crowd  was  now  buzzing  like  a 
hive.    Many  believed  Tilden  had  shot  his  bolt. 

As  the  fourth  set  progressed  and  Hayes  assumed  the  lead,  knowing  heads 
were  nodded.  At  5/3,  Hayes  was  three  times  within  a  point  of  the  set.  Twice 
Hayes  missed  his  favorite  shot,  each  time  from  exactly  the  same  position,  the 
ball  striking  the  tape  only  to  drop  back  into  his  court.  A  gasp  went  up  from 
the  crowd,  for  had  either  ball  trickled  over  the  net,  the  fourth  set,  and  in  all 
probability  the  match,  would  have  been  Hayes'.  Tilden,  encouraged  by  this  bit 
of  luck,  displayed  a  burst  of  speed  that  carried  him  to  victory. 

The  final  between  Tilden  and  Garland  proved  less  exhilarating  than  the 
semi-finals.  Garland's  machine-like  game  has  little  of  the  spectacular  about  it, 
and  the  fireworks  came  chiefly  from  Tilden.  He  employed  much  the  same  tac- 
tics as  in  his  match  with  Hayes,  demonstrating  his  mastery  of  every  known 
stroke.  When  he  again  dropped  the  third  set.  Garland's  adherents  had  hope 
for  the  first  time;  but  the  fourth  saw  Tilden  in  his  most  irresistible  mood,  and 
he  allowed  his  opponent  but  two  games. 

The  doubles  failed  to  furnish  any  particular  excitement  up  to  the  final  round, 
where,  as  predicted,  Garland  and  Hardy  met  Hayes  and  Burdick.  Tilden  and 
Waidner  might  have  proved  a  stumbling  block  to  either  team  had  Tilden  not 
shown  an  obvious  intent  of  saving  himself  for  singles.  Adoue  and  Wright,  the 
Southwestern  champions,  and  Hendrick  and  Bowen  of  Buffalo  were  possibilities, 
but  the  former  were  eliminated  by  O'Connor  and  Benson  of  Jackson  Park, 
while  the  latter  lost  to  Cochran  and  Campbell,  a  new  combination  that  worked 
so  well  that  they  afterward  defeated  Miller  and  Forstall,  finalists  in  the  Chi- 
cago city  championship.  The  match  between  the  Hayes-Burdick  combination 
and  the  Garland-Hardy,  went  to  five  sets.  To  Garland,  who  had  just  played  his 
singles  with  Tilden,  particular  credit  is  due.  His  play  was  as  sound  as  usual, 
and  backed  by  Hardy's  heady  game,  they  won  after  a  hard  struggle. 

Hardy  was  not  the  only  home  player  to  win  a  national  title,  for  Miss  Carrie 
B.  Neely  justified  her  reputation  as  the  best  local  player  by  winning  the 
women's  singles.  Mrs.  Adelaide  Yager  of  Los  Angeles  smoothed  the  way  for 
her  by  removing  both  Mrs.  McNeill  and  Miss  Waldo,  the  latter  having  beaten 
Miss  Neely  in  the  city  championship.  In  the  final  round  Mrs.  Yager  fell 
before  the  steadier  play  and  superior  volleying  of  Miss  Neely.  Another  Chicago 
winner  was  Mrs.  Ralph  Field,  who,  with  Miss  Bobbie  Esch  of  Cleveland,  fought

a  hard  battle  against  Miss  Neely  and  Mrs.  Yager  in  the  final  of  the  women's 
doubles.  Miss  Esch  gamely  undertook  the  long  journey  from  her  native  city 
alone,  and  besides  winning  the  doubles  gave  a  good  account  of  herself  in  the 
singles,  pushing  Miss  Neely  to  7/5  in  the  first  set.     The  summaries:

SPAU)ING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  71 

National  Indoor  Championships,  19 IQ'^     , 

By  S,  R.  McAllister,  New  York. 

The  twentieth  annual  tournament  for  the  national  indoor  championships  for 
men,  held  at  the  Seventh  Regiment  Armory,  New  York,  beginning  March  29, 
resulted  in  the  most  sensational  match  and  result  in  the  history  of  the  com- 
petition. The  singles  title  narrowed  down  to  a  contest  between  William  T. 
Tilden,  Jr.,  and  Vincent  Richards,  and  with  a  lead  of  two  sets  to  one,  defeat 
for  Tilden  did  not  appear  probable.  In  the  fourth  and  fifth  sets,  however,  he 
showed  a  great  falling  off  in  his  playing  and  Richards  emerged  a  winner.  The 
doubles  was  disappointing,  but  the  better  pair  won,  Tilden  and  Richards  win- 
ning the  honors  from  Fred  B.  Alexander  and  William  Rosenbaum  after  five  sets. 

S.  Howard  Voshell,  who  defeated  Alexander  for  the  title  last  year,  had  easy 
sailing  until  he  met  Tilden,  the  latter  winning  after  Voshell  had  much  the  better 
of  nearly  two  sets.  Richards'  hardest  match  on  his  way  to  the  final  was  with 
Fred  Anderson  in  the  fourth  round.  In  the  first  and  part  of  the  second  set 
Richards  was  completely  outplayed,  but  he  never  lost  confidence.  From  the 
time  of  winning  the  second  set  he  gave  a  fine  exhibition  of  well  judged  play 
and  the  result  never  seemed  to  be  in  doubt.  It  was  not  Voshell  alone  that 
put  Tilden  to  the  supreme  test,  for  in  the  fifth  round  Frank  Anderson  gave 
him  quite  a  heated  argument,  and  the  dash  and  speed  of  the  latter  quite 
surprised  Tilden,  who  finally  won,  7/9,14/12,6/3. 

The  matches  in  the  doubles  that  stood  out  did  so  chiefly  by  their  length. 
Cragin  and  Campbell  won  the  second  set  in  the  first  round  from  Hendrickson 
and  Emerson  only  at  19/17.  Shafei  and  Smith  won  from  Campbell  and  Cragin 
after  weakening  in  the  second  set.  In  the  third  round,  Alexander  and  Rosen- 
baum and  Tilden  and  Richards,  who  were  in  opposite  halves,  both  won  in 
straight  sets.  The  other  pairs  to  go  into  the  semi-finals  were  the  Anderson 
brothers  and  Allen  Behr  and  J.  H.  Steinkampf.     The  summaries:

National  Indoor  Women's  Championships,  1919 

By  S.  R.  McAllister,  New  York. 

Two  Boston  players,  Mrs.  George  W.  Wightman  and  Miss  Marion  H.  Zinder- 
stein,  won  the  two  titles  at  the  national  indoor  women's  championships,  held  as 
usual  under  the  auspices  of  the  Seventh  Regiment  Tennis  Club  at  the  armory 
in  New  York,  March  10-  to  14.  -Mrs.  Wightman's  greater  tournament  experi- 
ence and  superiority  in  the  pinches  were  the  factors  that  enabled  her  to  defeat 
Miss  Zinderstein  in  the  final  round  of  singles,  and  these  two  combined  won  the 
doubles  without  the  loss  of  a  set  or  being  fully  extended. 

The  absence  of  Miss  Molla  Bjurstedt,  the  titleholder,  who  was  in  Florida; 
of  Miss  Marie  Wagner,  six-time  champion,  and  of  Miss  Eleanor  Goss,  runner-up 
in  1917  and  1918,  made  a  big  hole  in  the  ranks  of  the  singles  contestants,  but 
a  strong  Boston  contingent  aided  in  making  the  event  a  very  interesting  com- 
petition.    The  summaries:

Metropolitan  Championships 

The  Metropolitan  championships,  held  under  the  auspices  of  the  Crescent 
Athletic  Club  on  its  turf  courts  at  Bay  Ridge,  Brooklyn,  during  the  week  of 
July  29,  1918,  produced  new  singles  and  doubles  champions.  In  the  singles, 
Ichiya  Kumagae,  the  famous  Japanese  player,  now  a  resident  of  New  York 
City,  supplanted  George  M.  Church,  and  in  the  doubles,  Dr.  William  Rosen- 
baum  and  Fred  C.  Baggs  secured  the  title  carried  off  by  Church  and  Dean 
Mathey  in  1916.  Seiichiro  Kashio,  another  clever  Japanese  player  who  also 
has  made  New  York  his  residence,  following  his  defeat  of  Baggs  in  the  second 
round,  was  taken  ill  and  had  to  default  in  both  singles  and  doubles. 

Kumagae's  opponent  in  the  final  round  of  singles  was  Harold  L.  Taylor  of 
Brooklyn.  The  latter  started  well,  but  later  became  very  erratic  at  the  net, 
and  although  he  tried  everything,  it  was  of  no  avail.  Kumagae  proved  entirely 
too  good  for  the  youngster  and  won  in  straight  sets.  The  doubles,  as  antici-

84  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Metropolitan  Women's  Championships 

Miss  Molla  Bjurstedt  won  for  the  third  successive  time  the  Metropolitan 
women's  championship,  held  by  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club,  beginning  June  10, 
1918,  thus  gaining  possession  of  the  Mrs.  Barger  Wallach  Challenge  Cup.  Miss 
Marie  Wagner  and  Miss  Clare  Cassel  won  the  doubles,  while  the  mixed  went 
to  Miss  Marion  Zinderstein  and  W.  M.  Hall. 

A  very  good  entry  was  received,  including  Mrs.  Theodore  Cassebeer,  Mrs. 
Rawson  Wood,  Miss  Cassel,  Miss  Goss  and  Miss  Zinderstein,  yet  no  one  suc- 
ceeded in  obtaining  a  set  from  the  national  champion.  Miss  Hooker  came 
through  three  rounds,  but  was  able  to  gain  only  one  game  from  Miss  Bjurstedt, 
Miss  Cassel  doing  a  little  better  with  three.  But  there  were  several  good  battles 
among  the  other  contestants.  Mrs.  Lynch  took  a  set  from  Miss  Zinderstein, 
and  Mrs.  Rogge  from  Miss  Pollock.  The  surprise  of  the  meeting  was  Miss 
Pollock's  victory  over  Miss  Zinderstein.  her  steady  play  proving  too  much  for 
the  brilliant  Bostonian.  As  was  expected.  Miss  Goss  won  easily  from  Miss 
Pollock,  and  Miss  Bjurstedt  from  Mrs.  Wood,  though  the  champion  was  forced 
to  play  one  deuce  set.  The  final  was  too  one-sided  to  be  interesting.  Miss 
Goss  tried  everything  she  knew,  but  it  was  Miss  Bjurstedt's  match  from  start 
to  finish. 

In  the  doubles.  Miss  Bjurstedt  and  Mrs.  Rogge  came  through  to  the  semi- 
finals by  wins  over  Mrs.  Wood  and  Mrs.  Weaver  and  Miss  Delia  Torre  and 
Miss  Winn,  but  went  down  in  straight  sets  to  Miss  Cassel  and  Miss  Wagner, 
who  were  right  on  edge.  The  winners,  continuing  their  good  work,  took  the 
final  from  Mrs.  Candee  and  Mrs.  Cassebeer  with  equal  facility. 

The  mixed  doubles  produced  an  interesting  final,  in  which  Miss  Bjurstedt 
and  F.  B.  Alexander  lost  to  Miss  Zinderstein  and  W.  M.  Hall  in  a  close  match. 
The  winners  were  aggressive  and  heady  and  combined  excellently.  The  sum-

Miss  Molla  Bjurstedt  again  won  the  singles  in  the  women's  invitation  tour-

Marie  Wagner  and  Mrs.  H.  S.  Green  won  the  doubles,  while  the  mixed  fell  to

Play  began  May  28,  1918,  and  continued  throughout  the  week  despite  dis- 
tressing weather.  There  was  plenty  of  good  tennis,  especially  in  the  mixed 
doubles,  in  which  four  men  from  the  Naval  Station  participated — H.  B.  and  J. 
S.  O'Boyle,  A.  Her  and  J.  M.  Hughes.

New  York  State  Championships 

Ichiya  Kumagae,  the  skillful  Japanese  player,  successfully  defended  his  title 
as  New  York  State  champion  at  the  tournament  held  on  the  courts  of  the 
Yahnundasis  Golf  Club,  Utica,  from  July  17  to  20,  1918.  By  unanimous  con- 
sent of  the  contestants  the  conditions  of  the  competition  were  so  changed  that 
instead  of  the  champion  being  required  to  play  through,  he  was  asked  only  to 
meet  the  tournament  winner  in  a  challenge  round. 

Seiichiro  Kashio,  Kumagae's  fellow-countryman,  showed  himself  to  be  the 
best  player  in  the  tournament.  When  he  faced  Kumagae  in  the  challenge  round, 
however,  he  found  the  going  much  rougher,  as  after  winning  the  first  set  he  lost 
the  next  three  and  the  championship. 

The  doubles  was  cleverly  won  by  Irving  C.  Wright  and  T.  C.  Fulton  from 
Frank  T.  Anderson  and  Harold  Taylor  after  a  well  played  first  set  in  the  final 
round.  An  additional  event  on  the  programme  was  a  men's  service  singles, 
which  was  won  by  H.  B.  O'Boyle  from  Alexander  Her  in  the  final  round,  6/1, 
6/3,2/6,6/3.    The  summaries:

Bronx  Singles  and  Manhattan  Doubles 

The  eighteenth  annual  tournament  of  the  New  York  Tennis  Club  attracted  a 
fine  entry  and  was  productive  of  some  really  excellent  tennis,  culminating  in  a 
splendidly  fought  final  match,  which  William  T.  Tilden,  Jr.,  won  from  Howard 
Voshell  in  the  fifth  set.  The  tournament  was  held  on  the  new  club  grounds  at 
238th  Street  and  Broadway  and  lasted  from  June  1  to  9. 

Tilden  reached  the  final  with  the  loss  of  but  one  set,  to  C.  E.  Johnson,  Jr., 
in  the  fifth  round.  Johnson's  aggressive  tactics  had  eliminated  Bassford  in  a 
close  match  in  the  fourth  round  and  he  forced  Tilden  to  exert  all  his  skill  to 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  91 

win.  Voshell  in  the  other  half  was  gaining  much  needed  practice,  and  he  too 
dropped  only  one  set,  to  Elliott  Binzen  in  the  semi-final. 

Tilden  being  engaged  in  Philadelphia  on  Saturday  in  the  Church  Cup  con- 
test, the  final  match  was  played  Sunday,  June  9.  Both  men  were  on  edge  and 
the  tide  of  battle  flowed  first  one  way,  then  the  other,  through  five  exciting  sets. 

Voshell  made  the  most  of  his  service  and  continually  strove  for  the  net, 
where  he  gained  most  of  his  points.  While  steadier  than  Tilden,  he  lacked 
the  latter's  brilliance  and  variety  of  strokes,  and  it  was  these  that  proved  the 
deciding  factor  in  the  fifth  set.  However  tired  Tilden  may  appear,  he  seems 
always  to  have  a  burst  of  speed  reserved  for  the  last  set,  and  on  this  occasion 
he   played   at   the   top   of   his   form,   allowing   Voshell   but   two    games. 

The  doubles  brought  forth  another  good  final  round  in  the  match  between 
Binzen  and  Hartman  and  Steinkampf  and  Bassford,  four  sets  being  required 
before  the  former  team  won.  Steinkampf  and  Bassford  had  two  difficult 
matches  with  Cecil  Donaldson  and  Anderson  and  Baggs  and  Voshell,  while  the 
Hartman  and  Binzen  combination  had  dropped  a  set  to  Henderson  and  Stair. 
In  the  final,  the  winners  started  with  a  rush,  winning  two  sets  with  something 
to  spare,  but  the  third  went  to  their  opponents,  who  had  steadied  and  who 
dropped  only  the  fourth  at  5/7.  Binzen  and  Hartman  were  just  a  little  better, 
however,  and  thoroughly  deserved  their  win. 


Long  Island  Championships 

The  annual  tournament  for  the  Long  Island  championships,  held  under  the 
direction  of  the  Kings  County  Club,  Brooklyn,  N.  Y.,  beginning  June  15,  1918, 
was  successfully  conducted  and  provided  an  abundance  of  good  play.  Frank 
T.  Anderson  won  the  singles,  defeating  his  brother,  Fred,  in  the  final  round 
after  four  well  played  sets.  The  doubles  went  to  J.  H.  Steinkampf,  Jr.,  and  H. 
H.  Bassford  in  a  four-set  final  with  A.  V.  Duncan  and  H.  Morgenthaler.  The

Brooklyn  (N.  Y.)  Championships 

The  1918  tournament  for  the  Brooklyn  championships,  played  at  the  Ter- 
race Club  of  Flatbush,  attracted  a  big  entry  list  and  was  very  successful.  The 
singles  honor  was  deservedly  won  by  Charles  Chambers,  who  had  a  hard  road 
to  travel  nearly  all  the  way.  He  faced  Ingo  Hartman  in  the  final  round  and 
had  to  play  four  sets  to  win.  The  doubles  furnished  a  whirlwind  finish.  From 
the  manner  in  which  Fred  Anderson,  Jr.,  and  G.  Donaldson,  Jr.,  started  off  in 
the  final  round,  it  looked  like  a  victory  for  them.  They  took  the  first  two  sets, 
but  lost  the  next  three  and  the  match  owing  to  the  steadiness  of  their  older 
opponents,  J.  H.  Steinkampf  and  H.  H.  Bassford. 


Sullivan  County    (N.   Y.)    Championships 

B.  M.  Arnold,  Jr.,  the  youngest  player  who  ever  reached  the  final  round  in 
the  seven  years  of  competition  for  the  Sullivan  County  championship,  defeated 
B.  Landau  for  the  singles  title  in  three  straight  sets,  the  first  set  standing  7/5. 
By  his  victory  Arnold  won  his  first  leg  on  the  Fred  B.  Alexander  Challenge 
Cup,  the  previous  winners  being:  1912-1913,  W.  C.  de  Mille;  1914-1915.  W. 
Halsey  Wood,  and  1916,  N.  W.  Swayne,  Jr.  There  was  no  contest  in  1917 
owing  to  war  conditions. 

Arnold,  paired  with  J.  R.  Pitman,  Jr.,  also  captured  the  honors  in  the  doubles 
in  straight  sets,  but  not  without  a  struggle  with  the  Smiths  in  the  final  round. 

The  tournament  was  ably  conducted  under  the  auspices  of  the  Merriewold 
Tennis  Club,  but  the  entry  list  was  much  smaller  than  usual,  due  no  doubt  to 
the  enlistment  of  players  into  the  military  or  naval  forces.     The  summaries:

round  of  the  doubles,  after  one  of  the  prettiest  matches  of  the  week. 

Several  exhibition  matches  were  played.  R.  Lindley  Murray  was  defeated  by 
W.  T.  Tilden,  Jr.,  7/5,6/1,6/4,  and  Miss  Bjurstedt  and  Murray  won  from  Miss

Pennsylvania  State  Championships 

William  T.  Tilden,  Jr.,  was  the  star  performer  in  the  tournament  for  the 
Pennsylvania  State  championships,  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Merion  Cricket  Club, 
Haverford,  beginning  June  10,  1918.  He  defeated  Dr.  P.  B.  Hawk  in  the  final 
round  of  the  singles,  Tilden's  playing  being  of  a  brilliant  order.  He  disposed 
of  his  veteran  opponent  in  straight  sets,  two  of  them  at  love. 

In  the  doubles,  Tilden  and  his  young  partner,  Carl  Fischer,  were  a  bit 
unsteady  in  the  first  two  sets  of  the  final  round  against  G.  C.  Shafer  and  John 
C.  Bell,  Jr.,  but  they  steadied  down  and  won  the  next  two  sets  and  match. 

The  tournament  was  entirely  successful,  and  there  was  plenty  of  excellent 
play  exhibited.     The  summaries:

Pennsylvania  and  Eastern  States  Women's  Championships 

While  the  entry  list  was  small  and  the  competition  confined  almost  exclu- 
sively to  local  players,  there  was  much  to  commend  at  the  tournament  for  the 
Pennsylvania  and  Eastern  States  women's  championships,  held  on  the  grass 
courts  of  the  Merion  Cricket  Club,  Haverford,  during  the  week  of  June  3,  1918. 

Miss  Eleonora  R.  Sears  was  the  class  of  the  singles,  her  most  powerful  oppo- 
nent being  Miss  M.  M.  Willard  in  the  semi-final  round,  which  Miss  Sears  won, 
6/3,6/3.  She  also  took  the  final  from  Mrs.  Fred  Betz,  6/0,6/1.  Miss  G.  Ost- 
heimer  and  Miss  E.  R.  Porter  won  the  doubles  from  Miss  A.  B.  Townsend  and 
Miss  R.  G.  Thomson  in  the  final  after  losing  the  second  set. 

Miss  S.  Franklin  and  W.  S.  Thomson  captured  the  final  of  the  mixed  doubles 
from  Miss  M.  M.  Willard  and  H.  S.  Endicott,  6/1,1/6,6/0.  Miss  A.  B.  Town- 
send  defeated  Mrs.  J.  E.  Bailey  in  the  final  of  the  consolation  singles,  6/2,6/2, 
and  Miss  S.  Franklin  and  Miss  M.  Law  won  the  final  of  the  consolation  doubles 
from  Mrs.  A.  Q.  Kolff  and  Mrs.  W.  K.  Yarrow,  6/4,7/9,7/5. 


George  Myers  Church  Cup  Competition 

The  first  intercity  team  competition  for  the  George  Myers  Church  Cup  was 
held  on  the  turf  courts  of  the  Merion  Cricket  Club,  Haverford,  Pa.,  June  7 
and  8,  1918,  the  result  being  an  overwhelming  victory  for  the  New  York  team, 
captained  by  F.  B.  Alexander.  Boston  was  defeated  on  the  first  day  by  six 
matches  to  three,  while  the  Philadelphia  team  lost  by  the  same  score. 

The  contest  was  entirely  successful  and  enjoyable.  While  each  of  the  cities 
found  it  difficult  to  put  a  representative  team  in  the  field  because  many  of 
their  best  players  were  in  the  service  or  unavailable  for  other  reasons,  yet  a 
strong  contingent  turned  out  for  each  city.  The  result  was  an  abundance  of 
good  play,  and  most  of  the  matches  were  fought  with  great  keenness.  The

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  97 

Philadelphia  Roof  Court  Tournament 

A  novelty  in  tennis  tournaments  was  provided  by  the  Philadelphia  and  Dis- 
trict Lawn  Tennis  Association,  when  quite  a  strong  field  of  players  participated 
in  a  competition  on  the  roof  of  the  John  Wanamaker  store  during  the  latter 
part  of  February  and  early  in  March,  1919.  The  roof  contains  two  courts 
constructed  of  boards  and  covered  with  canvas.  Save  for  heavy  wire  netting, 
making  them  cages,  the  courts  are  open  to  the  elements.  All  varieties  of 
weather  were  experienced  during  the  meeting. 

Philadelphia  was  strongly  represented  in  the  tournament,  the  players,  headed 
by  William  T.  Tilden,  Jr.,  including  Wallace  F.  Johnson  and  Craig  Biddle. 
Among  the  visitors  were  Fred  B.  Alexander,  S.  Howard  Voshell,  Ichiya  Kuma- 
gae,  Seiichiro  Kashio,  Vincent  Richards  and  Harold  Taylor.  Unfortunately 
Alexander  was  obliged  to  default  to  Tilden  in  the  semi-final  round  of  the 
singles  owing  to  illness,  and  with  Voshell,  his  partner,  did  not  appear  in  the 
doubles,  and  Taylor  also  defaulted  to  Tilden  in  the  fourth  round  of  singles. 

The  final  of  the  singles  attracted  the  largest  gallery  and  brought  out  the 
most  sensational  playing  of  the  tournament.  Tilden  and  Richards  were  the 
contestants.  Owing  to  rain,  the  courts  were  very  slippery  at  the  start.  Rich- 
ards by  clever  placing  and  accurate  volleying  took  the  first  set,  6/4.  The 
second  set  was  Tilden's  from  the  start,  6/3.  Richards  won  the  third  set,  T/5, 
but  from  there  on  Tilden  rushed  matters  and  won  the  fourth  and  fifth  sets  and 
the  match,  6/2,7/5.  In  the  doubles,  Wallace  Johnson  and  Craig  Biddle  looked 
like  winners  in  the  earlier  portion  of  the  final,  taking  the  first  set,  8/6,  and 
leading  in  the  second,  6/5.  At  this  stage  Tilden  and  Richards  braced  up  and 
won  three  straight  sets  and  the  match,  8/6,6/1,6/3. 


Central  Pennsylvania  Championships 

The  championships  of  Central  Pennsylvania  were  held  at  the  Altoona  Cricket 
Club,  Altoona,  Pa.,  August  27  to  30,  1918.  Red  Cross  bronze  medals  in  the 
form  of  watch  fobs  were  given  to  the  winners  and  the  balance  of  the  proceeds 
were  donated  to  the  Red  Cross.  In  the  singles,  Arthur  M.  George  of  Lancaster 
defended  his  title  successfully  against  L.  I.  Replogle,  winning  in  straight  sets; 
while  in  the  doubles,  George  and  F.  L.  Windolph  proved  superior  to  G.  A. 
Kerbaugh  and  C.  F.  King,  Jr.,  both  of  Altoona.    The  summaries: 

MEN'S    SINGLES.

98  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Western  Pennsylvania  Championships 

With  an  entry  list  of  unusually  high  class  and  a  fine  assortment  of  tennis 
throughout,  the  tournament  for  the  Western  Pennsylvania  championships,  held 
on  the  courts  of  the  Pittsburgh  Athletic  Association  during  the  week  of  June 
22,  1918,  was  one  of  the  most  successful  of  the  year.  W.  T.  Til  den.  Jr.,  of 
Philadelphia  garnered  the  honors  in  the  men's  singles  by  defeating  Charles  S. 
Garland  in  a  well  fought  four-set  match.  The  final  round  of  the  doubles  devel- 
oped into  one  of  the  best  matches  ever  played  on  the  courts.  The  winners 
were  Samuel  Hardy  and  C.  S.  Garland,  who  defeated  Tilden  and  P.  D.  Siverd 
after  five  thrilling  sets. 

Miss  Molla  Bjurstedt  and  Mrs.  George  W.  Wightmein  were  the  finalists  in 
the  women's  singles,  and  while  Miss  Bjurstedt  was  returned  the  winner,  the 
match  was  much  closer  than  the  score  would  indicate.  A  number  <  f  unusually 
strong  teams  appeared  in  the  mixed  doubles,  the  event  narrowing  down  to  a 
vigorous  two-set  match  between  Mrs.  G.  W.  Wightman  and  C.  S.  Garland  and 
Miss  Bjurstedt  and  W.  S.  McEllroy.  The  former  pair  won,  8/6,6/2.  The

Tri-State  Tournaments 

Ohio  State  Championships 

War  conditions  did  not  seem  to  affect  the  twenty-second  annual  tournament 
for  the  championships  of  Ohio,  held  at  the  East  End  Tennis  Club  of  Cleveland, 
beginning  August  17,  1918.  In  fact,  it  was  one  of  the  most  successful  in  the 
history   of   the   event. 

Samuel  Hardy  of  Chicago,  as  in  1917,  won  the  singles,  but  the  final  round 
had  an  unfortunate  ending.  Walter  Westbrook,  Hardy's  opponent,  led  at  two 
sets  to  one,  when  illness  compelled  him  to  default  irf  the  fifth  set.  What  was 
considered  the  surprise  of  the  tournament  was  the  defeat  of  A.  J.  Veysey  of 
Montreal,  winner  of  the  Great  Lakes  championship,  by  Dr.  W.  H.  Thwaites  of 
Grand  Rapids,  Mich.,  in  the  second  round.  In  the  doubles,  Westbrook  and 
Vinton  Vernon  were  winners  in  the  final,  after  losing  the  second  set,  10/12.

Cleveland  Associated  Tennis  Clubs 

By  B.  F.  Thorward,  President. 

The  second  season  of  tennis  in  Cleveland,  under  the  direction  of  the  Cleve- 
land Associated  Tennis  Clubs,  proved  far  more  successful  than  any  former  year 
of  tennis,  although  ■  many  of  the  local  stars  were  missed,  having  gone  into  war 
service.  Due  to  the  splendid  co-operation  given  the  association  by  the  member 
clubs,  the  tennis  interest  increased  among  the  junior  players,  and,  since  most  of 
the  tournaments  were  played  after  5  p.  M.,  the  entry  lists  for  all  tournaments 
were  larger  than  in  former  years.  The  tournaments  played  under  the  auspices 
of  the  C.A.T.C.  were:  City  championship,  men's  and  women's;  Cleveland  Dis- 
trict junior  championship,  boys'  and  girls';  Ohio  State  championship,  and  the 
"Red  Cross  Rapid  Fire"  tournament. 

The  Interclub  Tennis  League,  in  which  the  East  End  Tennis  Club  won  by 
the  closest  possible  margin  from  the  University  Club,  proved  an  interesting  race 
throughout  the  season  and  kept  tennis  activities  constantly  alive.  Following  is 
the  final  standing  of  the  league:

The  closing  match  of  the  year  between  University  Club  and  East  End  Ten- 
nis Club  proved  a  most  thrilling  wind-up,  University  winning,  6  to  3,  but 
lacking  one  match  of  winning  the  championship.  Nela  Park  earlier  in  the 
season  defeated  University  Club,  5  to  4,  which  was  the  upset  that  cost  the  lat- 
ter club  the  pennant.  Charles  Carran  of  the  West  Shore  Club,  former  Western 
Conference  intercollegiate  champion;  Vinton  Vernon  of  Nela  Park  Club, 
doubles  champion  of  Michigan  State  and  Ohio  State,  and  H.  C.  Wick,  Jr.,  of 
University  Club,  were  the  individual  stars  in  the  year's  intercollegiate  matches. 

The  Cleveland  Associated  Tennis  Clubs  officially  closed  their  season  on  Sep- 
tember 28  with  a  "Red  Cross  Rapid  Fire"  tournament,  which  is  believed  to  be 
the  largest  ever  played  in  one  afternoon.  It  was  held  on  the  courts  of  the 
three  largest  Cleveland  clubs — University,  East  End  and  Nela  Park.  Each  of 
the  eight  clubs  entered  twelve  men,  ninety-six  players  in  all,  and  these  men 
were  drawn  for  play  in  the  usual  manner,  although  it  was  arranged  so  that  no 
two  men  of  the  same  team  played  each  other  in  the  first  two  rounds.     Each

match  was  only  one  set,  the  winner  scoring  points  for  his  team.  The  first  round 
counted  one  point,  the  second  round  two  points,  and  so  on  up  to  the  final.  Any 
player  losing  in  the  first  round  went  into  the  consolations,  where  he  could  score 
points  for  his  team.    This  kept  all  the  players  interested  throughout. 

The  players  were  conveyed  in  automobiles  to  the  University  Club  for  the 
semi-finals  and  final.  Harold  Bartel,  holder  of  the  municipal  championship  in 
singles  and  doubles,  and  city  doubles  and  mixed  doubles  championship,  won 
the  tournament  and  the  Red  Cross  medal  by  defeating  George  Thorward  in  the 
final,  6/2.  On  the  way  to  the  final  Bartel  met  and  defeated  Charles  Carran, 
6/2,  and  H.  C.  Wick,  Jr.,  8/6.  East  Shore  Club  won  the  teani  prize  with  45 
points,  mainly  through  the  efforts  of  George  Thorward,  finalist,  and  T.  T. 
Fauntleroy,  winner  of  the  consolations,  each  player  scoring  15  points  toward 
team  score.  University  Club  was  second  with  38  points.  The  tournament  was 
followed  by  a  large  banquet  presided  over  by  Joe  Foster,  Jr.,  as  toastmaster, 
which  proved  a  brilliant  ending  to  a  splendid  tennis  season.  AH  present  voted 
to  make  the  Rapid  Fire  tournament  an  annual  affair. 

With  the  war  over  and  the  return  of  Cleveland  tennis  players  now  in  service, 
the  C.A.T.C.  are  confidently  looking  forward  to  1919  surpassing  last  year's 
record  in  interest  and  number  of  competitors. 


Cleveland  City  Championship 

By  B.  F.  Thorward,  President  Cleveland  Associated  Tennis  Clubs. 

S.  W.  Cabell  again  won  the  Cleveland  city  championship,  held  on  the  East 
End  and  University  Club  courts,  beginning  June  22,  1918.  The  entries  com- 
prised all  the  city's  best  talent,  including  several  hard  hitting  juniors,  but  the 
persistent  efforts  and  sound  judgment  of  Cabell  enabled  him  to  cope  success- 
fully with  their  impetuous  attacks.  After  one  or  two  narrow  escapes,  due  to 
lack  of  practice,  his  form  improved,  and  he  was  able  to  put  out  both  H.  C. 
Wick  and  H.  Botten  in  the  semi-final  and  final,  respectively. 

Two  juniors,  H.  Bartel  and  H.  Hane,  won  the  doubles  in  an  exciting  five-set 
match  from  Wick  and  Botten.  It  was  a  hard  hitting  contest  throughout,  with 
many  errors  on  all  sides,  yet  with  so  many  thrilling  rallies  that  the  spectators 
were  kept  on  edge  throughout  the  match.     Summaries:

Tennis  in  Indiana 

By  Charles  Trask. 

The  only  ones  who  could  spare  time  to  play  tennis  in  Indiana  in  1918  were 
the  boys  and  juniors,  the  older  players  being  either  in  war  service  or  other- 
wise too  busy  to  indulge  in  their  favorite  pastime.  However,  the  juniors  and 
boys  were  not  neglected,  and  a  very  fine  tournament  was  given  for  them.  This 
tournament  and  the  city  championship  of  Indianapolis  were  the  only  events 
which  were  played  in  Indiana  last  year. 

In  the  junior  tournament,  exceptional  form  was  shown  by  John  Hennessey, 
Minie  Cohn  and  Jack  Petrovisky.  Hennessey  defeated  Cohn  in  the  semi-finals 
in  a  very  interesting  and  hard  fought  four-set  match.  The  weather  was  very 
bad  during  the  week  and  it  was  necessary  to  play  this  match  on  the  fine  indoor 
court  belonging  to  Mr.  Carl  G.  Fisher.  In  the  final,  Petrovisky,  who  had  won 
the  interscholastic  championship  of  Indiana,  met  Hennessey,  and  while  there 
was  no  doubt  as  to  the  final  outcome,  the  match  was  very  interesting  and 
closely  contested.  Petrovisky  showed  exceptional  form  in  his  forehand  ground 
stroke.  However,  Hennessey's  shots  were  too  severe,  both  from  his  forehand 
and  backhand,  and  he,  taking  advantage  of  any  opportunity  to  come  to  the  net, 
was  able  to  hold  the  match  well  in  hand.  The  match  was  decided  in  four  very 
well  played  sets.  The  winning  of  this  junior  championship  gave  Hennessey 
the  right  to  play  in  the  national  junior  championship  at  New  York. 

The  city  tournament  saw  a  few  of  the  older  players  in  action,  but  the  greater 
majority  were  juniors,  the  total  number  entered  being  sixty.  Nothing  excep- 
tional occurred  until  the  finals,  where  the  veteran.  Gage  Hoag,  met  John  Hen- 
nessey, the  State  junior  champion.  Hoag  was  very  steady,  but  Hennessey 
waited  until  he  got  one  to  his  liking  and  then  he  would  put  it  away  for  the 
point.  He  followed  these  tactics  throughout  the  match  and  while  it  was  very 
close,  one  could  see  from  the  play  that  Hennessey  was  the  stronger  of  the  two. 
In  justice  to  Hoag,  however,  it  must  be  said  that  he  had  played  very  little, 
and  entered  the  tournament  merely  to  try  to  make  it  a  success.  Hennessey  lost 
the  first  set  and  won  the  next  three  and  the  match.  By  doing  this  he  became 
the  city  champion,  which  is  equivalent  to  the  State  championship. 

In  the  boys'  championship,  three  young  players  cropped  out  that  ought  to 
make  very  fine  tennis  players  with  proper  training.  They  were  Jack  Thomas, 
Dick  Hennessey  and  Hence  Orme,  Jr.  The  final  outcome  of  the  boys'  tourna- 
ment lay  with  one  of  these  three  and  the  honor  went  to  Jack  Thomas. 

In  September,  Hennessey  went  to  New  York,  where  he  played  in  the  national 
junior  championship,  and  in  going  through  defeated  Fred  Anderson,  who,  I 
think,  was  considered  the  logical  winner  of  the  tournament.  However,  Hen- 
nessey succimibed  to  the  attack  of  Harold  Taylor  in  the  final.  This  was  the 
first  time  that  Hennessey  had  ever  played  on  grass,  and  this,  together  with  his 
nervousness  before  a  large  audience  in  a  strange  place,  probably  did  not  help 
his  game  very  much.

Kentucky  State  Championships 

By  Crit  C.  Young. 

Owing  to  the  heavy  inroads  made  on  the  ranks  of  the  local,  Southern  and 
Western  tennis  players  by  the  war,  it  was  found  necessary  to  abandon  all  of 
the  tournaments  scheduled  at  Louisville  except  the  Kentucky  State  champion- 
ship event.  However,  this  developed  the  best  tennis  played  here  in  many 
years,  as  the  entry  list  was  composed  almost  entirely  of  men  from  Camp 
Zachary  Taylor,  Camp  Knox  and  West  Point,  the  three  big  army  cantonments 
which  are  located  here.  They  hailed  from  all  parts  of  the  country  and 
embraced  players  who  had  gained  more  than  reputations  in  their  home  cities. 

The  events  that  were  played  were  men's  singles  and  doubles,  and  although 
numerous  civilians  above  the  draft  age  participated,  the  prizes  went  to  army 
officers. 

In  the  men's  singles  final,  Captain  Middleton  DeCamp,  who  had  put  up  a 
smashing  game  all  through  the  tournament,  went  to  pieces,  losing  out  in 
straight  sets.  In  the  semi-final  round  DeCamp  played  in  brilliant  style  against 
Lieutenant  F.  L.  Johnson  of  California,  who  is  credited  with  several  victories 
over  McLoughlin  and  other  stars.  The  sets  were  two  to  one  against,  and  the 
game  score  in  the  third,  2 — 0,  when  DeCamp  took  a  decided  brace  and  ran  a 
string  of  six  consecutive  victories.  The  next  set  went  to  him,  6/4.  Shelton 
Arterburn,  who  held  the  championship  for  three  years,  was  defeated  in  the 
second  round  by  W.  H.  Mc Alpine.     Following  are  the  summaries:

Western  Tournaments 


Western  Championships 

All  efforts  failed  to  secure  a  single  outside  player  of  note  for  the  Western 
championships,  held  at  the  Chicago  Tennis  Club,  July  17  to  August  5,  1918, 
although  Tilden,  Garland,  Byford  and  Voshell  all  were  considered  possible 
entries  up  to  the  last  moment. 

The  result  was  a  repetition  of  the  city  championship,  Walter  Hayes  again 
defeating  Samuel  Hardy  in  the  final  of  the  singles,  while  the  Hayes-Burdick 
combination  romped  home  in  the  doubles.  Burdick  was  expected  to  give  Hayes 
a  hard  fight  in  the  semi-final,  but  failed  to  secure  more  than  two  or  three  games 
a  set.  Simultaneously,  Edward  Oelsner  was  giving  Hardy  the  game  of  his  life 
on  the  opposite  court.  Like  Burdick  in  the  city  championship,  he  made  the 
veteran  produce  all  his  cunning,  headwork  and  tournament  experience  to  win. 
This  match  proved  to  be  the  feature  of  the  tournament  and  held  the  crowd  for 
three  full  hours  in  a  temperature  over  90  degrees. 

Oelsner  forced  the  pace  from  the  start,  his  terrific  drives  to  the  corners  keep- 
ing Hardy  on  the  defensive.  With  a  lead  of  two  sets,  8/6,6/4,  he  looked  like 
the  winner,  but  could  not  maintain  the  pace.  Hardy,  seizing  his  opportunity,  in 
turn  assumed  the  aggressive.  Forcing  the  play  to  Oelsner's  backhand  at  every 
opportunity,  he  then  took  the  net  for  the  finishing  shot.  At  two-sets-all  both 
men  appeared  spent,  but  Oelsner  spurted  and  after  long  baseline  duels  led,  3/2 
and  forty-love.  Hardy  clung  on  and  by  pertinacity  and  a  never-say-die  spirit 
evened  the  score.  This  was  Oelsner's  final  effort,  and  Hardy,  now  summoning 
his  last  reserves,  took  the  net  on  his  service  and  won  the  last  two  games  with 
unexpected  ease. 

Hardy  could  not  recuperate  quickly  enough  to  give  Hayes  much  of  a  match 
the  following  day,  and  the  latter  won  in  straight  sets  by  sound,  consistent  base- 
line play.  Hardy,  game  to  the  core,  fought  to  the  end  against  hopeless  odds. 
He  forced  the  second  set  to  7-aU  and  the  third  to  3-all,  when  he  could  run  no 
further.  Though  he  fought  on  to  the  last  stroke,  it  was  apparent  to  all  that 
Hayes  had  only  to  prolong  the  rallies  in  order  to  win. 

In  the  doubles,  Lee  Campbell,  a  promising  South  Park  player,  paired  with 
Hardy  and  held  up  his  end  in  a  creditable  manner  until  the  semi-final,  where, 
opposed  to  Hayes  and  Burdick,  he  seemed  overcome  with  diffidence  and 
did  not  play  the  strong  game  of  which  he  is  capable.  They  proved  easy  prey 
for  the  city  champions,  as  did  also  Miller  and  Oelsner  in  the  final.  Burdick's 
brilliant  smashing  and  Hayes'  steady  returns  were  the  chief  features  of  interest 
in  both  matches. 

Miss  Carrie  B.  Neely  was  the  only  noted  Chicago  player  to  enter  the  women's 
events,  Mrs.  McNeill,  Miss  Waldo,  Miss  Voorhies  and  Mrs.  Miller  failing  to 
enter.  This  tournament  was  chiefly  notable  for  the  fine  play  of  Mrs.  W.  L 
Northup,  for  two  years  Oregon  champion.  Opposed  to  Miss  Neely  in  the  final, 
she  acquitted  herself  in  a  most  creditable  manner.  Her  deep  and  well  placed 
drives  provided  long  rallies  which  delighted  the  spectators,  but  if  forced  to  the 
net  she  was  usually  passed  by  her  opponent.  Miss  Neely's  resourcefulness  and 
tournament  experience  were  well  illustrated  in  this  match.  Finding  that  a  base- 
line game  placed  her  on  an  equal  footing  with  her  opponent,  she  came  to  the 
net  at  every  opportunity  and  dropped  her  return  short,  thus  ending  many  rallies.

Illinois  State  Championships 

Walter  T.  Hayes  won  the  Illinois  State  championship,  held  at  the  Edgewater 
Beach  Hotel,  Chicago,  September  7-15,  1918,  without  the  loss  of  a  set,  thus 
gaining  permanent  possession  of  the  three-year  trophy  presented  by  A.  G. 
Spalding  &  Bros,  in  1912. 

The  two  former  Illinois  champions,  Byford  and  Squair,  were  in  service,  while 
Hardy  and  Burdick  were  away  on  their  vacations.  Consequently  Hayes  experi- 
enced little  difficulty  in  coming  through  the  small  field.  The  Michigan  State 
champion,  Walter  Westbrook,  succumbed  to  Oelsner's  terrific  drives  in  the  semi- 
final, while  Lucian  Williams  distinguished  himself  by  a  fine  win  over  Harry 
Waidner.  In  his  match  with  Hayes  he  was  unable  to  secure  a  set,  though  he 
forced  him  to  8/6  in  the  second.  The  final  found  Hayes  at  the  top  of  his  game 
and  he  fairly  smothered  Oelsner,  who  gained  but  three  games  in  as  many  sets. 

In  the  men's  doubles,  Hayes  paired  with  George  O'Connell,  a  junior  of  Jack- 
son Park.  After  dropping  the  first  set  in  their  final  match  against  Oelsner  and 
Woods,  O'ConneU  settled  down  to  steady  play  under  Hayes'  tutelage.  They 
won  the  next  three  sets  in  a  spirited  match,  in  which  O'Connell  came  in  for  a 
large  share  of  the  gallery's  applause.  It  is  to  be  hoped  that  other  noted  players 
will  emulate  Hayes'  example  in  thus  encouraging  junior  tennis.  Hayes  coidd 
easily  have  secured  a  more  noted  partner,  and  it  is  gratifying  that  his  sports- 
manship had  its  reward  in  victory. 

Mrs.  McNeill,  city  champion,  was  the  winner  in  both  women's  events.  After 
dropping  the  first  set  of  her  first  match  to  Miss  Rose  Fogelson  at  5/7,  she  won 
her  way  through  to  the  final  with  ease.  There  Miss  Marion  Leighton,  who  had 
lost  the  first  set  to  love,  carried  the  second  to  6-all  before  succimibing  to  her 
more  experienced  opponent.  Miss  Katherine  Waldo  partnered  Mrs.  McNeill  in 
the  women's  doubles,  which  they  won  without  the  loss  of  a  set.  In  the  final 
they  met  Mrs.  Ralph  Field  and  Miss  Marion  Leighton,  whom  they  defeated 
after  a  hard  struggle,  9/7,6/4.     The  summaries:

Chicago  City  Championships 

Walter  Hayes  began  a  most  successful  season  by  winning  the  singles  and, 
with  his  partner,  the  doubles  in  the  1918  city  championships,  played  at  the 
Chicago  Tennis  Club,  June  8  to  16,  inclusive.  A  lucky  drawing  gave  him  easy 
matches  until  the  final,  while  the  other  chief  contenders  for  the  title — Hardy, 
Burdick,  Oelsner  and  Miller — struggled  against  each  other  in  the  opposite  half. 
The  best  match  of  the  tournament  was  in  the  semi-final,  where  Hardy  exhausted 
himself  in  a  three-hour  match  with  Burdick.  The  following  day  Hayes  found 
Hardy  an  easy  victim,  defeating  him  with  comparative  ease  in  straight  sets  by 
careful,  steady  play. 

Hayes  and  Burdick  revenged  themselves  upon  Waidner  and  Hardy  for  their 
previous  year's  win  by  a  straight-set  victory  in  the  semi-final,  and  won  the  final 
against  Miller  and  Forstall  with  the  loss  of  but  seven  games. 

Mrs.  Malcolm  McNeill  won  the  women's  singles  from  a  field  comprising  Chi- 
cago's best  players.  She  seemed  to  find  her  old-time  form,  winning  her  three 
matches  with  the  loss  of  but  five  games.  Miss  Katherine  Waldo  deserves  much 
credit  for  her  win  over  Miss  Carrie  B.  Neely,' though  the  latter  was  handicapped 
by  the  loss  of  her  glasses.  Winning  at  8/6,  7/5,  she  was  too  spent  to  do  her- 
self justice  in  the  final  against  Mrs.  McNeill,  whose  fine,  steady  play  gave 
promise  of  victories  in  later  tournaments. 

Miss  Neely  and  Miss  Waldo  won  the  women's  doubles  without  the  loss  of  a 
set,  while  Miss  Marion  Leighton,  who  with  a  little  more  experience  should 
become  a  champion,  won  the  mixed  with  Edward  Oelsner. 

The  boys'  and  juniors'  sectional  tournaments,  which  had  been  going  on  dur- 
ing the  previous  week  in  several  sections  of  the  city,  were  completed  at  this 
time.  Milton  Agay,  by  his  aggressive  net  game,  gained  the  junior  title,  his 
hardest  match  being  in  the  final,  against  J.  R.  McKnight. 

The  boys'  singles  was  won  by  Bradley  Guyton  of  Jackson  Park,  who  defeated 
Minard  McNeill,  son  of  Mrs.  Malcolm  McNeill,  in  the  final.    Guyton  displayed

a  high  order  of  play  and  generalship  for  a  boy  of  fifteen.  He  is  indebted  to 
his  father,  0.  F.  Guyton,  for  much  of  his  tennis  training,  and  many  players

Chicago  Tennis  Association 

By  Wilbur  Jackson,  Secretary. 

The'  Chicago  Tennis  Association  entered  upon  the  fifth  year  of  its  exist- 
ence with  nineteen  active  clubs  and  several  associate  clubs.  Two  active  clubs 
dropped  out,  one  the  Midway  Tennis  Club,  whose  entire  team  was  in  service, 
the  other  the  Elmwood,  owing  to  difficulty  in  securing  grounds;  but  the  Har- 
vester and  Homan  clubs  came  in,  thus  keeping  the  number  of  active  clubs  up 
to  that  of  the  previous  season. 

Immediately  after  his  election  to  the  presidency,  C.  R.  Pierce  initiated  the 
policy  of  holding  open  board  meetings  at  weekly  luncheons,  which  were 
attended  by  an  average  of  twenty  interested  tennis  players.  This  plan  proved 
to  be  the  means  of  keeping  interest  in  tennis  alive  during  the  winter  months. 

The  first  important  step  was  the  decision  to  hold  a  benefit  for  Chicago  ten- 
nis players  in  service.  This  was  held  at  the  Chicago  Arena,  the  largest  and 
handsomest  ice  skating  rink  in  America,  and  was  attended  by  more  than  2,000 
persons.  The  feature  of  the  event  was  a  doubles  match  of  tennis  on  ice 
between  Hayes  and  Burdick,  Western  champions,  and  Oelsner  and  Kenfield, 
winners  of  the  Chicago  Tennis  Association  doubles  championship,  the  former 
pair  winning.  There  was  also  an  exhibition  of  fancy  skating  by  E.  H.  Fabrice 
of  the  Chicago  Tennis  Club.  The  event  was  such  a  decided  success  that 
another  benefit  was  held  a  month  later,  the  feature  being  a  doubles  tournament 
on  ice,  sixteen  teams  entering.  Six  double  courts  were  marked  out  and  play 
continued  every  evening  until  the  tournament  was  finished.  Hayes  and  Burdick 
won,  thus  keeping  their  record  clean  on  both  land  and  water. 

During  the  winter  months  an  indoor  tournament  was  held  on  the  concrete 
courts  of  the  Municipal  Pier.  The  singles  went  to  M.  G.  Ketchum  and  the 
doubles  to  Ketchum  and  L.  C.  Nutter,  the  popular  secretary  of  the  association. 

In  the  interclub  matches,  the  clubs  were  reclassified  according  to  their  play- 
ing strength,  instead  of  being  geographically  arranged  as  in  the  past.  Class  A, 
representing  the  strongest  division,  played  the  major  schedule  of  six  events  in 
singles  and  three  in  doubles,  and  was  won  by  the  Chicago  Tennis  Club.  This 
team  came  through  the  season  without  losing  a  match  and  also  won  the  special 
match  against  the  aU-star  team  picked  from  all  other  clubs  in  Division  A. 
Division  B  played  the  same  schedule  and  was  won  by  the  Unatre  Club,  which 
won  every  match.  The  winner  of  Class  B  goes  into  Class  A  next  season,  and 
the  team  with  the  lowest  record  in  Class  A  drops  to  Class  B.  The  C  division, 
playing  a  lighter  schedule  of  three  events  in  singles  and  two  in  doubles,  was 
won  by  the  Austin  Tennis  Club,  whose  team  lost  only  one  set  throughout  the 
season. 

In  the  closed  tournament,  open  only  to  players  who  had  represented  the 
various  clubs  in  interclub  play,  the  singles  returned  Ed  Oelsner,  Chicago  Qub,

winner,  who,  teamed  with  Don  Wiley  of  the  same  club,  won  the  doubles.  The 
first  Chicago  Veterans'  tournament  was  held,  the  singles  being  won  by  George 
W.  Byington  of  Irving  Park.  This  was  a  very  popular  victory,  as  he  had  been 
a  hard  worker  for  the  association  and  was  one  of  its  organizers.  The  doubles 
went  to  Carr  and  Forbrich  of  the  Washington  Park  Club. 

The  other  activities  of  the  association  included  the  publication  af  a  special 
Chicago  number  of  Tennis  Review,  the  compilation  of  which  was  entrusted  to 
the  worthy  hands  of  Leo  Lund,  and  a  directory  of  Chicago  tennis  players,  the 
first  ever  published.  This  has  proved  very  helpful  to  committees  in  charge  of 
tournaments,  as  it  contains  not  only  addresses  but  telephone  numbers.  The  asso- 
ciation prepared  a  special  die  for  medals  and  fobs  to  be  awarded  as  prizes  in 
all  tournaments  held  under  its  auspices.  Daily  papers  were  sent  to  the  ambu- 
lance units  of  which  Chicago  players  were  members  and  were  highly  appre- 
ciated, as  many  letters  in  the  secretary's  office  testify.  Also,  tennis  equipment 
was  collected  and  sent  to  the  army  camps.  The  association  also  finances  the 
project  of  sending  Chicago  players  to  participate  in  the  national  singles  and 
doubles,  Hayes  and  Burdick  being  selected. 

In  addition  to  the  regular  schedule  of  interclub  matches,  the  association 
conducted  the  following  tournaments:  City,  State,  Boys'  and  Juniors',  Veterans', 
Lawchester  Red  Cross,  South  Park,  Indoor,  and  West  Maywood.  The  following 
officers  were  elected  for  the  1919  season:  R.  L.  Van  Arsdale,  president;  L.  C. 
Nutter,  vice-president;  Wilbur  Jackson,  secretary;  L.  R.  Hayes,  treasurer. 
Directors — J.  C.  Stewart,  P.  H.  Maas,  F.  G.  Wilber,  E.  H.  Fabrice,  Alam 
MacFarlane. 

President  Van  Arsdale  resigned  January  31,  owing  to  pressure  of  business, 
and  Harry  S.  Knox,  vice-president  of  the  South  Side  Tennis  Club,  was 
appointed  to  fill  the  unexpired  term. 

For  the  first  time  in  the  history  of  Chicago  tennis,  an  attempt  was  made  to 
rank  the  players.  Fifty-five  men  were  ranked,  the  first  ten  being,  in  their  order 
of  merit: 


1.  Walter  T.  Hayes.       5.    A.  Hubbell.  8.

By  L.  D.  Leavitt. 

The  Chicago  Public  Parks  Tennis  Association  completed  its  third  successful 
season  under  the  direction  of  the  following  officers:  H.  A.  Silver,  president; 
J.  O.  McKiernan,  vice-president;  H.  A.  Bach,  secretary  and  treasurer;  L.  D 
Leavitt,  chairman  of  Tournament  Committee. 

In  spite  of  many  adverse  conditions,  eleven  clubs,  the  same  number  as  the 
previous  season,  played  their  schedules  without  a  single  forfeit.     The  season

opened  June  1  and  closed  August  3,  1918,  all  matches  being  played  on  Satur- 
day  or  Sunday  of  each  week. 

In  the  Northern  Division  there  was  a  new  winner  in  Garfield  Park,  this 
team  going  through  the  season  with  a  clean  slate  of  eight  wins  and  the  loss  of 
but  two  individual  matches  in  forty  played.  In  the  Southern  Division,  Jack- 
son Park's  team  of  veteran  players  made  an  even  better  showing,  repeating 
their  previous  season's  victory  with  ten  matches  won  and  none  lost,  and  the 
loss  of  but  three  individual  matches  in  fifty  played. 

The  play-off  between  Jackson  and  Garfield  parks  for  the  public  parks  cham- 
pionship was  held  on  the  courts  of  the  South  Park  Tennis  Club  and  resulted 
in  a  clean  sweep  of  all  five  events  for  Jackson  Park,  the  scores  being  as  fol- 
lows: Singles— R.  Parks  d.  C.  J.  Dolan,  6/4,6/1,6/3;  Bradley  Guyton  d. 
Alferdro  Marasigan,  6/1,6/3,6/2;  O.  F.  Guyton  d.  J.  0.  McKiernan,  6/2,6/3, 
6/2.  Doubles— C.  W.  Fowler  and  L.  D.  Leavitt  d.  L.  E.  Daniel  and  W.  H.  Ruth, 
6/4,6/3,6/4;   0.  F.  Guyton  and  F.  Pearson  d.  A.  Marasigan  and  L.  Llalano. 

On  the  whole,  the  play  v»{as  fully  up  to  the  standard  of  previous  seasons  and 
several  promising  yoimg  players  were  developed,  who  are  sure  to  be  heard 
from  in  a  few  years,  Ralph  Guyton  of  Jackson  Park  and  Ralph  Rice  of  Speed- 
way showing  up  best.  In  a  year  or  two  they  should  make  valuable  members 
for  any  team.     Following  is  the  final  standing  of  teams:

Tennis  in  Detroit 

By  N.  H.  Bowen. 

Tennis  had  a  much  better  year  in  Detroit  in  1918  than  might  have  been 
anticipated.  The  redeeming  features,  helping  to  balance  the  absence  of  many 
good  players,  were  the  lively  interest  maintained  by  most  of  those  not  in  mili- 
tary service,  especially  the  younger  generation,  and  the  fact  that  Walter  West- 
brook  had  the  best  season  a  Detroit  player  perhaps  has  ever  enjoyed,  winning 
tournaments  East  and  West  and  taking  a  place  in  the  country's  "third  ten"  in 
singles,  by  grace  of  the  Ranking  Committee,  while  in  doubles  he  and  James  of 
Sjrracuse  were  placed  seventh  in  the  United  States.  Westbrook  showed  marked 
improvement  over  his  previous  playing  and  will  go  stiU  higher  in  the  future,  in 
the  judgment  of  experienced  critics. 

There  were  fewer  tennis  events  than  usual,  though  the  city  and  State  tourna- 
ments were  conducted  as  in  previous  years,  and  the  Detroit  Tennis  Club  par- 
ticipated in  the  League  of  the  Lower  Lakes  events  at  Buffalo.  But  the  usual 
team  events  with  Toledo,  University  of  Michigan  and  other  nearby  teams  were 
dropped  for  the  year. 

The  city  tournament  was  held  in  September  with  a  fair  entry,  but  the  play 
was  rather  mediocre  with  the  exception  of  the  final  match,  in  which  R.  H. 
Doughty,  the  old  State  and  city  title  holder,  "came  back"  after  being  out  of 
the  big  events  for  two  or  three  years  and  made  a  splendid  fight  against  his 
younger   opponent,    Westbrook.      When   he   was   in   his   stride.    Doughty    gave 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  121 

Westbrook  far  more  of  a  battle  than  anyone  else  had  done  in  Detroit  during 
the  year;  in  fact,  had  the  better  of  him  while  he  could  maintain  the  pace,  but 
he  was  rather  unsteady  except  in  one  set — the  third — which  he  won  in  fine 
style.  Westbrook  was  not  spectacular  in  this  match,  but  was  careful  and 
accurate,  making  fewer  mistakes  than  Doughty.     The  scores: 

Semi-final  Round— Westbrook  d.  Raseman,  6/2,6/2;  Doughty  d.  Dean  Emerson,  6/2,6/2. 
Final  Round— Westbrook  d.  Doughty,  8/6,6/2,3/6,6/2.  No  doubles  or  women's  events  were 
played. 

The  usual  junior  and  boys'  events  were  held,  the  winners  of  the  preliminary 
tournaments  playing  off  at  the  State  tournament.    The  final  scores: 

Juniors— Lewis  Munz  d.  George  Reindel,  1/6,6/4,8/6,2/6,6/4.  Boys— Paul  Jerome  d.  J.  L. 
Zemon,   6/4,6/3,6/4. 

Westbrook's  career  for  the  season  was  a  brilliant  one,  as  he  won  the  singles 
honors  in  the  New  England,  Michigan,  West  Michigan  and  Detroit  tourna- 
ments, and  the  doubles  in  the  New  England,  Connecticut  Valley,  West  Mich- 
igan and  Ohio  events.  Besides,  he  all  but  won  the  Ohio  championship  in 
singles,  having  the  veteran  Sam  Hardy  two  sets  to  one  when  he  developed  a 
bad  case  of  cramps  and  ultimately  had  to  default.  It  was  the  general  verdict 
that  he  outplayed  Hardy  in  this  match  up  to  the  time  he  was  incapacitated. 
In  the  Massachusetts  doubles,  also,  he  made  a  fine  showing  with  Theodore 
Lightner,  a  Detroit  boy,  the  pair  all  but  beating  Harry  Johnson  and  Irving 
Wright,  the  crack  Boston  team. 

The  biggest  event  of  the  year  in  Detroit,  as  far  as  numbers  went,  was  the 
parks  tournament,  conducted  by  the  City  Recreation  Commission,  which  is 
taking  a  most  commendable  interest  in  tennis.  Ten  events  were  staged,  the 
total  entry  list  including  nearly  one  hundred  individuals,  representing  North- 
western, Atkinson,  Water  Works,  Edison,  Belle  Isle,  Packards,  Burroughs  and 
Ford  tennis  clubs.  More  interest  is  being  shown  in  this  tournament  each 
year,  and  with  the  returning  of  the  boys  from  war  service  the  1919  tournament 
should  be  a  record-breaker.  The  final  scores  of  the  various  events  were  as 
follows: 

Men's  Singles— S.  L.  Ferguson  d.  H.  H.  Hutchison,  7/5,6/4,3/6,6/4.  Men's  Doubles— H. 
H.  Hutchison  and  I.  Van  Tassell  d.  J.  B.  Lee  and  S.  B.  Seay,  6/4,8/6,10/8.  Women's 
Singles— Miss  Marian  Gambs  d.  Mrs.  Norris,  6/1,6/4.  Women's'  Doubles — Miss  Gambs  and 
Miss  Jones  d.  Mrs.  Norris  and  Miss  Morris,  8/6.6/2.  Mixed  Doubles— Miss  Gambs  and 
Perry  d.  Mrs.  "Van  Tassell  and  Hutchison,  6/4,3/6,6/4.  Boys'  Singles— J.  L.  Zemon  d. 
Alan  Devine,  6/2,3/6,6/2,2/6,6/3.  Boys'  Doubles— Sidney  Israel  and  Louis  Frank  d.  M. 
Divine  and  W.  Alfred,  6/1,6/1,6/1.  Junior  Singles— George  Reindel,  Jr.,  d.  Paul  Jerome, 
6/4,6/3,6/1.  Junior  Doubles— B.  Tait  and  H.  Harris  d.  Hartwig  and  Hoenke,  6/4,3/6,2/6, 
7/5,9/7.     Girls'  Singles— Audrine  Jones  d.   L.  Morris,   6/3,6/1,6/2. 

Detroit  tennis  was  strongly  represented  in  the  war,  about  forty  members  of 
the  Tennis  Club  being  in  various  branches  of  the  service,  besides  numerous 
players  outside  the  club.  Among  the  well  known  players  who  were  in  active 
sei"vice  were  S.  L.  Ferguson,  parks  champion,  who  was  wearing  a  navy  uniform 
at  the  time  he  took  the  title;  James  Shields,  runner-up  in  1917  parks  tourna- 
ment; P.  J.  Donovan,  R.  G.  Owen,  former  city  champion;  Ira  H.  Reindel,  John 
Codd  and  Theodore  Lightner.     Donovan,  Owen  and  Reindel  were  overseas. 


Michigan  State  Championships 

The  Michigan  State  event,  held  in  Augi'st,  called  out  a  fair-sized  entry,  but 
despite  the  presence  of  four  fine  players  from  Ohio,  there  was  no  one  on  hand 
who  could  take  a  set  from  Westbrook.   In  fact,  Detroit  "froze  out"  the  outsiders

altogether  in  the  finals,  Carl  Raseman  having  disposed  of  Henry  Wick  of 
Cleveland  in  straight  sets  in  the  semi-finals,  while  Westbrook  was  beating 
Gordon  Minor  the  same  way.  In  the  earlier  rounds,  Raseman  had  defeated  H. 
W.  Hane  of  Marion,  Ohio,  a  youngster  who  gives  much  promise,  and  Wick  had 
eliminated  his  fellow-Clevelander,  Vinton  Vernon,  who  is  also  a  comer,  to  all 
appearances. 

In  the  men's  doubles,  the  Ohioans  swept  the  boards,  and  Hane  and  Vernon 
won  the  title  by  disposing  of  Wick  and  Minor  in  the  final.  The  doubles  play 
was  not  especially  good,  though  Hane  and  Vernon  had  some  streaks  that  were 
high  class. 

Miss  Buda  Stephens  of  Detroit  took  the  women's  singles  title,  defeating  Miss 
Emily  Stark  of  Adrian  in  the  final.  Miss  Bobbie  Esch  and  Miss  Ruth  Wise  of 
Cleveland  were  eliminated  by  the  Misses  Stark  and  Stephens,  respectively,  in 
the  semi-finals.  The  women's  doubles  was  won  by  Miss  Stephens  and  Mrs.  F. 
J.  Loewe  from  the  Misses  Wise  and  Esch  in  a  nice  match,  7/5,7/5,  in  the  final 
round.  The  mixed  doubles  furnished  close  competition,  Miss  Stephens  and 
Westbrook  finally  winning  out.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  125 

Lawn  Tennis  in  Milwaukee 

By  R.  B.  Roehr,  President  Milwaukee  Tennis  Association. 

The  season  of  1918  was  one  of  the  most  successful  in  the  history  of  the  Mil- 
waukee Tennis  Association.  This  is  true  not  only  from  the  standpoint  of 
increased  competition  and  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  quite  a  number  of  players 
were  drawn  into  the  service  as  a  result  of  the  various  draft  calls,  but  also  from 
the  standpoint  of  the  quality  of  play  that  was  exhibited. 

Two  tournaments  were  held,  one  an  innovation  in  tennis  affairs  of  Milwaukee 
County,  namely,  the  boys'  junior  tournament,  which  was  held  during  the  week 
of  June  24,  and  the  other,  the  county  championship,  was  held  during  the  week 
of  July  15. 

The  boys'  junior  tournament  was  a  decided  success  and  will  doubtless  become 
a  permanent  fixture  so  far  as  local  county  tennis  affairs  are  concerned. 

The  tournaments  were  of  particular  significance  to  the  association  and  to  fol- 
lowers of  tennis  in  Milwaukee  County  and  elsewhere  in  the  State  of  Wiscon- 
sin, for  the  reason  that  practically,  for  the  first  time  in  the  history  of  Mil- 
waukee Tennis  Association  affairs,  these  tournaments  were  given  official 
recognition  by  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association,  by  reason 
of  the  Milwaukee  Association  being  a  member  of  the  Western  Association. 

Although  there  was  not  a  very  large  entry  in  the  boys'  junior  tournament, 
this  was  due  to  several  reasons.  The  competition  was  limited  to  boys  under 
nineteen  years  of  age.  At  the  time  the  tournament  was  held,  a  great  number 
of  eligible  boys  had  already  departed  for  their  summer  vacations.  Then,  too, 
the  tournament  being  an  entirely  new  one,  there  were  any  number  of  boys 
who  held  back  because  of  lack  of  experience  and  an  inclination  to  doubt  their 
ability  to  put  up  a  good  game. 

The  final  match  brought  out  a  splendid  exhibition  between  Benny  Arndt  and 
Tony  Hollender,  being  finally  won  by  the  latter  after  a  gruelling  contest.  Hol- 
lender's  superior  staying  qualities  and  general  all-around  play  is  what  won  for 
him.  He  also  exercised  fine  judgment  in  his  change  of  plays,  taking  advan- 
tage, particularly  during  the  last  three  sets,  of  every  weakness  that  was  exhib- 
ited by  Arndt.  The  beautiful  medal  awarded  Hollender  by  the  United  States 
National  Lawn  Tennis  Association  was  greatly  appreciated  by  the  winner. 

The  county  championship  tournament  also  was  a  success,  though  there  were 
not  as  many  entries  as  had  been  anticipated;  but  the  quality  of  play  more 
than  made  up  for  the  lack  of  entries. 

Bert  Thelen,  veteran  of  a  dozen  years  of  tennis  and  winner  of  a  score  of 
trophies,  surpassed  all  Milwaukee  followers  of  the  net  game  in  his  feat  of  win- 
ning the  singles  championship.  Thelen's  class  and  play  was  primarily  the  out- 
standing feature.  He  met  upwards  of  half  a  dozen  of  the  best  players  within 
Milwaukee  County  and  defeated  all  of  them  decisively.  He  did  the  same  thing 
in  the  elimination  contest  for  the  singles  championship  of  the  Milwaukee  Ten- 
nis Association  proper.  Thelen  is  the  proud  possessor  of  both  titles  for  the 
year  1918  and,  with  particular  reference  to  the  elimination  contest  within  the 
association  itself,  his  win  gives  him  two  chances  on  the  President's  Cup.  In 
order  to  become  the  permanent  possessor,  it  is  necessary  for  a  contestant  to 
win  three  times,  not  necessarily  in  succession. 

Naturally,  as  a  result  of  his  prowess,  Thelen  secures  the  undisputed  rank  of 
No.  1,  so  far  as  Milwaukee  County  players  are  concerned.     Although  it  will  be

said  that  some  good  men  were  in  the  service,  the  fact  remains  that  among 
"good  men"  must  be  placed  the  name  of  Louis  Rechcygl,  former  city  cham- 
pion, who  went  to  defeat  before  Thelen  in  the  deciding  match  for  the  Wash- 
ington Park  Tennis  Club  title.  In  second  position  should  be  placed  Elmer 
Lipman,  the  fleet-footed  Washington  Park  man,  whose  work  in  the  team  con- 
tests aided  his  club  considerably.  He  also  played  well  in  all  tournaments.  It 
is  claimed  that  Lipman  makes  one  of  the  best  doubles  partners  in  the  State. 

There  is  just  a  bit  of  doubt  regarding  the  selection  of  the  next  four  players, 
although  Rechcygl  is  given  the  third  position.  The  fact  remains  that  Arndt, 
Effler  and  Hollender  equaled  the  exhibitions  of  Rechcygl  in  1918,  though,  of 
course,  past  performances  naturally  would  reflect  to  some  extent  on  the  rank- 
ings in  a  case  of  this  kind.  Benny  Arndt  played  great  tennis,  as  did  Hollen- 
der. Net  followers  know  how  the  Washington  Park  player  lost  to  HoUender  in 
the  junior  championship,  only  to  trim  Hollender  later  in  the  season.  A  bit  of 
misfortune  held  back  Harry  Effler,  for,  after  reaching  the  final  in  the  county 
championship,  only  to  fall  before  Thelen,  he  also  relinquished  his  hold  on  the 
Milwaukee  Tennis  Association  laurels. 

In  speaking  of  Hollender  it  might  be  stated  that  he  is  one  of  the  local  play- 
ers who  has  a  future  at  the  tennis  game.  Young  as  he  is,  he  almost  ranks  with 
the  best.  Nick  Aagesen  gets  a  position  because  of  his  good  work  in  the  team 
matches,  while  Amos  is  ranked  ninth  for  winning  the  county  doubles  honors, 
with  Louis  Rechcygl  as  partner.  Cherrington  is  included  in  the  list  because  of 
his  work  in  the  county  tournament.  There  are  others — players  who  were  in 
the  service— who  deserve  a  position,  but  they  played  too  little  to  be  considered. 
These  are  Wallie'  Stuckert  and  Ray  Loew  of  the  Washington  and  National 
Tennis  Clubs,  respectively.

Tennis  in  St.  Louis 

By  Robert  Ross. 

The  junior  preliminary  tennis  center  championship  was  held  on  the  courts  of 
the  Triple  A  and  sixteen  youngsters  aspired  to  the  honor,  some  excellent  tennis 
resulting.  Nearly  every  match  went  the  three  sets,  and  should  the  youngsters 
practice  and  study  the  game,  St.  Louis  may  yet  possess  a  national  champion. 
Val  Satterfield  and  Clyde  Baessler  reached  the  final  round,  Satterfield  winning 
in  straight  sets,  6/4,6/3,6/4. 

The  Municipal  Association  also  held  a  center  championship,  which  was  won 
by  Wray  Brown.  The  finals  were  played  on  the  Triple  A  courts,  Brown  win- 
ning the  honor  of  going  East  to  the  national  junior  championship. 


I  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  127 

In  the  boys'   preliminary,   fourteen   entries  were  received,   some  very   good 
i^jinnis  resulting.    Howard  Gould  and  Stockton  Sommer  reached  the  final  round, 
lommer  winning  out  in  a  hard  four-set  match,  6/2,4/6,6/4,6/2. 
'  i  The  winner  of  the  boys'  tournament,  held  by  the  Municipal  Association,  was 
jichard  Rosebrough,  who  was  to  play  Sommer,  but  the  latter  was  obliged  to 
■  lave  for  college  and  defaulted  to  Rosebrough  in  the  final  round. 
In  the  city  championship,  seventy-four  players  entered,  and  the  good  effects 
f  holding  junior   tournaments   became  apparent.     Most  of   the  juniors   who 
layed  in  the  earlier  tournament   entered   the  men's  championship  and   gave 
3me  of  the  older  players  a  hard  fight,  some  of  the  latter  even  going  down  to 
efeat  before  the  youngsters. 

Theodore  Drewes,  the  1917  champion,  won  his  way  to  the  final  by  defeating 
le  following  players:  J.  H.  Flachsbarth,  W.  Smith,  Ed  Serrano,  H.  S.  Cush- 
lan  and  Rae  HoUinshead.  In  the  lower  half,  the  seventeen-year-old  junior, 
^ray  Brown,  was  eliminating  all  players  in  his  path.  In  the  semi-finals  he 
let  Satterfield,  another  junior  and  had  a  rather  easy  victory,  6/3,6/0,6/0. 
In  the  final  round  against  Theodore  Drewes,  Brown  was  seemingly  off  his 
;ame,  as  he  should  have  made  a  much  better  showing  against  the  champion 
ban  he  did,  although  Drewes  was  playing  championship  tennis  that  afternoon. 
In  the  doubles,  sixteen  teams  entered,  the  older  players  successfully  reaching 
he  fini|ls.  Drewes  and  Von  Reppert  in  the  upper  half  met  Jones  and  Hoerr, 
he  former  pair  winning  in  a  hard  four-set  match,  5/7,6/2,6/4,8/6. 

The  city  championship  for  women  was  held  on  September  24  and  was  won 
)y  Miss  Gould,  who  defeated  Mrs.  H.  S.  Adams  in  the  finals.  In  the  doubles, 
kiiss  Gould  was  paired  with  Mrs.  Adams  and  met  Miss  Hagemeyer  and  Miss 
loever  in  the  final  round.  It  was  expected  that  the  former  pair  would  have 
10  trouble  in  winning,  but  their  opponents  put  up  a  surprisingly  good  game. 
Vlthough  defeated.  Miss  Hagemeyer  and  Miss  Roever  with  a  little  more  tour- 
lament  experience  will  have  much  to  say  in  deciding  future  city  doubles 
;hampionships.    The  score  was  6/4,9/7. 

The  junior  city  championship  was  held  by  the  Triple  A  with  an  entry  of 
wenty-five  players,  and  the  play  showed  a  vast  improvement  over  that  of  the 
jarlier  tournament.  Dan  Diesel  in  the  first  round  defeated  R.  Rosebrough, 
1/6,6/3,6/3.  In  the  second  he  disposed  of  D.  Hilkenbaumer,  12/14,6/3,6/3, 
vhile  in  the  semi-finals  he  won  from  Roy  Bliekamp,  6/1,6/3,6/3.  In  the  lower 
lalf,  George  Pasmore  defeated  R.  Jordan,  6/4,6/3;  H.  Gould,  6/0,6/3;  A. 
!leiman,  6/4,6/1,  and  R.  Fowler  in  the  semi-finals,  6/1,6/3,5/7,6/3.  In  the 
inal  round  Diesel  won  out  after  a  five-set  match,  4/6,7/5,6/4,8/6,6/4.  In  the 
inal  round  of  the  doubles,  Diesel  and  Bliekamp  won,  defeating  Drewes  and 
'asmore,  10/8,6/2,3/6,6/4. 

The  Municipal  Association,  as  is  its  custom,  held  a  tournament  in  each  park, 
lie  winners  of  each  division  playing  off  for  the  championship  of  the  associa- 
ion.  Every  division  had  a  large  entry,  although  they  also  felt  the  effects  of 
he  war.    The  winners  of  the  different  divisions  were  as  follows: 

Singles — Leo  Moult,  Carondelet  Park;  Charles  M.  Borne,  St.  Louis  Park; 
Jlmer  Schwarz,  Forest  Park;  Theodore  Drewes,  Fairground  Park;  Fred  Jos- 
ies,  O'Fallon  Park.    Theodore  R.  Drewes  was  the  winner  in  final  play-off. 

Doubles — Moult  and  Walberg,  Carondelet  Park;  Borne  and  Koenneman,  St. 
^ouis  Park;  Schwarz  and  Schwarz,  Forest  Park;  Drewes  and  Niemoeller. 
''airground  Park.     Drewes  and  Niemoeller  were  the  winners  in  finals.

Brooklyn,  N.  Y. 
Central  States  Champion. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  129 

Central  States  Championships 

By  Robert  Ross. 

The  Central  States  championships  were  held  under  the  auspices  of  the  St. 
>ouis  Amateur  Athletic  Association — Triple  A  Club — on  July  6,  with  an  entry 
st  of  forty-eight  players  in  the  men's  singles.  Although  the  war  made  a 
eavy  inroad  on  the  entry  list,  it  was  the  means  of  making  the  1918  cham- 
ionship  one  of  the  most  interesting  from  the  viewpoint  of  the  tennis  fan,  as 
;  gave  to  the  tournament  S.  Howard  Voshell  and  Craig  Biddle,  who  were  at 
icott  Field,  111.,  in  the  flying  service. 

In  the  first  round  Voshell  met  the  young  player,  W.  G.  Drozda,  and  disposed 
f  him  rather  easily.  In  the  second  round  he  met  another  youngster,  Wray 
Jrown,  who  represented  the  club  in  the  national  junior  championships.  Wray 
'as  naturally  a  little  excited  in  the  first  set,  which  Voshell  placed  to  his  credit 
t  6/3;  but  in  the  second,  Voshell  had  to  extend  himself,  the  set  going  to  7/5, 
nd  most  of  the  games  were  deuced  several  times.  The  next  in  his  path  was 
'red  Josties  of  Municipal  fame,  but  the  latter  did  not  put  up  the  tennis 
xpected  of  him  and  went  down  to  defeat.  In  the  semi-finals,  Voshell  met  Ted 
3rewes,  holder  of  the  1917  championship,  but  the  steady  smashing  game  of 
/oshell  won  out  in  a  hard  match. 

While  Voshell  was  fighting  his  way  through  in  the  upper  half,  his  partner. 
Iraig  Biddle,  was  pushing  all  opposition  aside  in  the  lower  half.  In  the  first 
ound  he  defeated  Dr.  F.  Diekneite;  in  the  second,  N.  P.  Gautier;  in  the  third, 
W.  R.  Schneider;  while  in  the  fourth  he  met  some  opposition  from  E.  A. 
khwarz,  the  score  being  6/4,6/3.  The  semi-finals  found  him  opposed  to 
Poland  Hoerr,  who  has  two  legs  on  the  trophy  and  only  needs  another  to  gain 
permanent  possession.  On  him  the  St.  Louis  fans  pinned  their  faith  to  keep 
he  big  cup  from  going  to  the  Eastern  players,  but  they  were  due  for  a  disap- 
)ointment,  as  the  fast  smashing  game  of  Biddle  was  too  much  for  the  local 
avorite. 

On  Saturday,  when  the  final  was  played,  every  inch  of  space  around  the 
championship  court  from  where  a  play  could  be  seen  was  occupied,  and  the 
ipectators  were  rewarded  with  as  fine  a  display  of  tennis  as  ever  was  seen  on 
he  courts.  The  first  set  went  to  Biddle,  6/4,  and  was  fast  tennis  from  start 
o  finish.  In  the  next  set  Biddle  seemed  to  tire  and  the  gallery  began  to  think 
hat  it  was  all  over,  Voshell  taking  the  set,  6/1.  In  the  third  set  Biddle  did 
letter,  securing  three  games.  The  fourth  long  will  be  remembered  by  those 
vho  had  the  pleasure  of  witnessing  it,  the  games  seesawing  from  one  to  the 
4her,  most  games  going  to  deuce  repeatedly  and  both  players  making  almost 
Impossible  plays;  but  the  steady  smashing  of  Voshell  finally  won  out  with  the 
core  9/7.  Kumagae  has  a  leg  on  the  trophy  and  St.  Louis  fans  are  hoping, 
iow  that  the  war  is  over,  that  he  and  Voshell  will  be  here  in  1919  to  try  to 
place  their  names  on  the  cup  for  the  second  time. 

In  the  Central  doubles,  seventeen  teams  entered,  Voshell  pairing  with  Biddle. 
I.  B.  Adoue  and  George  Wright  of  Texas  entered,  but  at  the  last  minute  busi- 
less  interfered  with  their  making  the  trip.  Voshell  and  Biddle  met  Hilton  and 
lEichmeier  in  the  first  round  and  disposed  of  them,  6/1,6/2.  In  the  second 
hey  met  Wray  Brown  and  Dr.  Carson.  The  fans  expected  a  hard  match,  but 
vere  disappointed,  the  army  men  winning,  6/1,6/1.  In  the  semi-finals  they 
net  Drewes  and  Josties,  the  local  stars,  in  a  match  producing  both  good  and  bad

tennis.  The  first  two  sets  went  to  Voshell  and  Biddle,  6/1,6/4,  the  spectators 
coining  to  the  conclusion  that  the  doubles  championship  was  also  to  go  to  the 
Eastern  players.  But  in  the  third  set  the  youngsters  began  to  hit  their  stride 
and  took  the  set  at  6/4,  and  the  fourth  also  by  the  same  score. 

It  was  now  two-sets-all  and  both  teams  settled  down  to  hard  work.  Some 
fine  tennis  was  displayed  by  each  player,  Voshell  and  Drewes  playing  the 
"take-a-chance  game"  when  opportunity  offered,  while  Josties  and  Biddle  were 
content  to  play  a  safe,  steady  game.  The  games  were  evened  up  alternately 
until  the  score  came  to  5-aU,  when  the  youngsters  took  the  next  two  games 
and  the  match.  The  spectators,  of  whom  there  were  several  thousand, 
applauded  the  good  plays  of  each  side;  but  when  they  realized  that  the  home 
youngsters  had  won  they  rose  in  a  body  and  gave  three  rousing  cheers  for  the 
winners,  in  which  they  were  joined  by  the  delegation  of  about  one  hundred 
flyers  from  Scott  Field.  Voshell  and  Biddle  will  always  have  a  warm  spot  in 
the  hearts  ef  the  St.  Louis  players,  who  earnestly  desire  their  return  this  year.

Central  States  Women's  Championships 

By  Robert  Ross. 

The  women's  Central  championship  also  felt  the  effects  of  war  service,  most 
of  the  players  doing  Red  Cross  work.  Only  twenty  entries  were  secured,  and 
the  majority  played  their  matches  whUe  off  duty.  Mrs  A.  Yager  (now  Mrs. 
Rameson)  of  Los  Angeles,  in  the  first  roUnd  defeated  Miss  Helen  Dyer,  6/0, 
6/0,  and  in  the  second  Miss  N.  Burgee,  6/2,6/0.  In  the  third  round  she  met 
with  some  opposition  from  Miss  Etta  Roever,  the  score  being  6/4,6/3.

In  the  lower  bracket.  Miss  Corinne  Gould,  the  seventeen-year-old  local  player, 
who  holds  the  State  and  city  championships,  was  working  her  way  to  the 
finals.  In  the  preliminary  round  she  met  the  former  State  and  city  champion. 
Miss  Arnstein,  who  later  on  served  the  Red  Cross  in  France.  Miss  Arnstein 
put  up  a  good  fight,  the  score  being  6/4,6/3.  In  the  second  round  she  defeated 
Miss  M.  Haase,  6/1,6/1;  in  the  third  round,  Mrs.  H.  S.  Adams  of  Centralia, 
111.,  by  the  same  score;  in  the  fourth  she  defeated  Miss  F.  Mabley,  6/1,6/2, 
and  met  Mrs.  Yager  in  the  final  round.  Mrs.  Yager  was  the  favorite,  but  the 
match  was  a  pleasant  surprise  to  the  many  admirers  of  Miss  Gould's  play. 
She  took  the  match  rather  easily,  6/2,7/5,  Mrs.  Yager  displaying  some  fine 
tennis  in  the  last  set,  but  the  accurate  fast  serve  and  steady  placing  of  Miss 
Gould  could  not  be  overcome. 

In  the  women's  doubles,  Mrs.  Yager  and  Miss  Gould  paired  and  had  no 
difficulty  in  winning,  the  only  hard  match  being  in  the  second  round,  where 
they  defeated  Mrs.  Adams  and  Miss  Arnstein,  6/3,9/7.  In  the  mixed  doubles, 
Davison  Obear  and  Mrs.  Yager  met  E.  Schwarz  and  Mrs.  Adams  in  the  final

St.  Louis  Tennis  Association 

By  Davison  Obear,  Secretary. 

When  the  St.  Louis  Lawn  Tennis  Association  held  its.  first  meeting  of  the 
1918  season,  the  fact  that  we  were  in  the  war  had  begun  to  show  its  effect  by 
the  absence  of  a  number  of  prominent  players,  and  the  prospects  for  a  suc- 
cessful year  were  far  from  promising.  However,  the  officers  canvassed  the 
local  situatioij,  and  at  the  June  meeting  the  membership  showed  an  increase 
over  1917. 

The  five  park  clubs  held  an  interclub  tournament  throughout  the  summer 
under  the  direction  of  the  Municipal  Tennis  Association,  and  seven  of  the 
remaining  eight  clubs  also  held  an  interclub  series  under  the  supervision  of  the 
St.  Louis  Tennis  Association.  The  O'Fallon  Park  Club  won  the  municipal 
championship,  while  the  Magnolia  Tennis  Club  was  victorious  in  the  St.  Louis 
Tennis  Association  event.   In  the  play-off  for  the  city  championship,  the  O'Fal-

In  the  play-off  for  the  city  championship  the  O'Fallon  Park  Tennis  Club 
defeated  the  Magnolia  Tennis  Club  team,  3  to  0.  Several  clubs  were  forced  to 
default  their  matches  on  account  of  their  players  going  into  the  service. 
Despite  the  war  conditions  the  season  was  a  successful  one,  as  five  more  clubs 
took  part  in  the  play  than  in  1917. 

Owing  to  the  influenza  epidemic,  the  second  annual  meeting  was  postponed 
until  February  6,  1919.  At  this  time  nearly  all  of  the  prominent  officials  of  the 
various  clubs  who  had  been  in  the  service  returned  to  the  city.  The  following 
officers  for  1919  were  elected:  Honorary  president,  Major  Dwight  F.  Davis; 
president,  Calvin  P.  Bascom;  vice-president,  Moe  D.  Levy;  secretary,  Davison 
Obear;  treasurer,  Dr.  George  H.  Rice.  Reports  of  the  past  season's  activities 
were  made,  and  the  O'Fallon  Park  team  was  presented  with  a  handsome  ban- 
ner for  winning  the  championship.  Many  ideas  were  brought  forth  by  the 
delegates,  one  of  vital  importance  being  put  into  effect.  This  was  the  estab- 
lishment of  weekly  luncheons  to  be  held  every  Thursday.  Three  of  these  have 
already  been  held  and  are  proving  extremely  valuable.  At  the  April  meeting 
more  definite  steps  will  be  taken  as  to  the  plans  for  the  coming  season. 

The  active  workers  in  the  St.  Louis  Tennis  Association  w'sh  to  make  it  a 
clearing  house  for  tennis  in  every  nook  and  comer  of  the  .xty.  Honesty  and 
fair  play  is  one  of  the  principal  policies  of  the  organization,  and  the  news- 
papers have  recognized  this  fact  time  and  time  again,  as  evidenced  by  thei? 
most  generous  support.  Every  possible  effort  is  made  to  conform  to  the  wishe 
of  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association  and  the  Western  havf; 
Tennis  Association  in  the  furtherance  of  not  only  local  but  national  interest  in 
what  many  consider  here  the  greatest  of  all  games — tennis. 


Tennis  in  Kansas  City 

By  C.  E.  McBride. 

The  tennis  ranks  of  the  Kansas  City  clubs — Rockhill,  the  Field  Club,  the 
Kansas  City  Athletic  Club,  and  even  the  numerous  neighborhood  clubs — were 
depleted  probably  more  than  any  other  branch  of  sport  by  players  entering  the 
war  service. 

The  Rockhill  Club,  Kansas  City's  exclusive  tennis  club  and  one  of  the  best 
equipped  in  the  country,  lost  one  hundred  members,  one-third  of  its  member- 
ship. However,  a  fine  tribute  to  this  club  is  the  fact  that  the  finances  were  in 
such  condition  that,  despite  the  loss  of  members,  the  club  went  through  the 
summer  and  winter  without  an  assessment  against  the  remaining  members,  and 
is  making  unusual  preparations  for  taking  back  the  old  members  as  they  return 


136  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

from  the  service  and  for  tournaments  in  the  summer  of  1919.  The  Rockhill 
Club  now  has  fourteen  of  the  finest  clay  and  grit  courts  in  the  country  and 
plans  are  under  way  to  build  seven  more,  the  ground  being  adequate  for  that 
number. 

Always  may  it  be  said  of  the  tennis  clubs  in  Kansas  City,  not  only  those  of 
the  private  clubs  but  the  one  hundred  public  courts  as  well,  that  they  gave 
their  best  to  the  country  in  the  war,  and  at  the  same  time  made  a  fine  attempt 
at  "carrying  on"  at  home  while  their  members  were  training  in  this  country  or 
in  the  fighting  forces  abroad. 

The  Kansas  City  Athletic  Club  passed  up  its  annual  Missouri  Valley  tourna- 
ment, probably  the  best  known  of  the  big  Valley  tournaments;  but  Rockhill 
and  the  Field  Club  held  patriotic  tournaments  and  the  players  of  all  the  clubs 
took  part  in  a  renewal  of  the  city  tournament,  playing  the  matches  on  the 
various  club  courts. 

Charles  Howard  Mills,  Recreation  Supervisor,  also  played  a  part  in  keeping 
something  doing  for  the  tennis  folks  at  home,  devoting  his  efforts  to  the  players 
who  use  the  public  courts.  A  gigantic  tournament  was  held  and  a  fine  interest 
shown  by  the  public  court  players. 

Howard  Penfold,  a  youth,  defeated  Heath  Moore,  a  veteran  of  many  a  hard 
fought  tournament  match,  in  the  final  of  the  city  tournament,  played  on  the 
field  of  the  Kansas  City  Athletic  Club  in  June.  Ernie  Primm  beat  Soldanels 
in  the  final  of  the  city  junior  tournament  on  the  Field  Club  courts,  also  held 
in  June. 

The  annual  Missouri  State  tournament,  held  on  the  Field  Club  courts  in 
August,  found  Ted  Drewes,  the  youthful  St.  Louisan,  coming  into  his  own,  by 
defeating  C.  T.  Speice,  an  Oklahoman,  in  the  final.  Drewes  and  Niemoeller 
won  from  Simmons  and  Durall  in  the  doubles. 

A  mixed  doubles  tournament  was  played  on  the  Field  Club  courts  in  Septem- 
ber, Ernie  Primm  and  Miss  Mary  Morley  winning  from  L.  T.  Shonnard  and 
Miss  Marjorie  Hires  in  the  final.  Miss  Morley  was  a  victim  of  the  epidemic 
of  Spanish  influenza  the  following  November.  She  was  one  of  the  veteran 
vvomen  players  of  Kansas  City  and  will  be  missed  in  tennis  circles  of  the  city. 

The  Municipal  tournament  ran  on  the  city  courts  through  August  and  Sep- 
tember. Solden  Els  won  the  men's  singles  and  Joe  Jackson  the  boys'  singles. 
Miss  Margaret  Donovan  won  the  women's  singles  and  Miss  Martha  McLendon 
the  girls'  singles. 

The  high  school  tennis  tournament  is  an  interesting  event  each  spring.  In 
1918  Merrill  Dubach  of  Central  won  the  singles  title,  Wilson  Riley,  Northeast, 
being  the  runner-up.  In  the  doubles,  Denebeim  and  Reicher,  Westport,  were 
defeated  by  the  Dubach  brothers,  Merrill  and  Kenneth.  Miss  Laura  Small, 
Westport,  won  the  singles  in  the  girls'  play.  Miss  Martha  McLendon,  Central, 
being  the  runner-up.  Miss  Dorothy  Kaney  and  Miss  Ruby  Euston  of  Central 
were  the  doubles  winners. 

All  of  the  clubs  are  making  preparations  for  a  big  season  in  the  summer  of 
1919.  Captain  Cannon  and  Major  Holcomb,  Field  Club  stars  and  winners  of 
many  a  Valley  tournament,  have  written  from  France  that  they  expect  to  be 
back  and  put  the  speed  of  some  of  the  younger  players  to  the  test. 

A  list  of  the  members  of  the  Rockhill  Club  who  entered  the  service  will  be 
interesting  in  that  many  widely  known  players  are  included,  and  for  the  further 
reason  that  it  gives  some  line  on  the  great  showing  Kansas  City  tennis  men 
made  in  the  war  work.    The  list  follows:

140  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Missouri  State  Championships 

Despite  war  conditions,  a  large  entry  list  was  received  for  the  Missouri  State 
championships,  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Kansas  City  Field  Club,  beginning 
August  3,  1918.  While  tennis  far  beyond  the  ordinary  was  afforded  the  spec- 
tators, almost  half  of  the  contestants  declined  to  play,  owing  to  the  torrid 
weather. 

Theodore  R.  Drewes,  whose  play  throughout  was  of  exceptionally  high  class, 
won  the  singles  title  from  Charles  T.  Speice  in  the  final  round  after  losing  the 
first  set,  4/6.  The  final  of  the  doubles  found  Drewes  and  Arthur  Niemoeller 
opposing  E.  C.  Simmons  and  Harry  W.  Durall.  It  was  a  one-sided  encounter, 
the  former  pair  winning  in  straight  sets.     The  summaries:

Central  West  Women's  Championships 

The  Central  West  women's  championships,  held  by  the  Kansas  City  Field

Kansas  State  Championships 

The  third  annual  tournament  for  the  championships  of  Kansas  was  held  on 
the  six  new  courts  of  the  Independence  Lawn  Tennis  Association  from  July  8 
to  12,  1918.  Although,  handicapped  by  the  absence  of  the  younger  element  of 
players  who  were  in  the  service,  the  association  was  fortunate  in  securing  a 
good  out-of-town  and  State  entry,  and  as  a  result  there  were  many  closely  con- 
tested matches.  Kenneth  B.  Uhls  of  Kansas  City  won  the  final  round  of  singles 
after  a  hard  contest  with  Phil  Bagby,  a  fellow-townsman,  and  these  two  took 
the  doubles.  Cleo  Sneed  won  the  consolation  singles  and  O'Brien  and  Feath*

Northwestern  Tournaments 


Tennis  in  the  Northwest 

By  Ed  Walker. 

Tennis  in  the  Northwest,  as  generally  predicted  throughout  the  country,  will 
have  a  banner  season  in  1919.  Plans  are  under  way  to  reorganize  the  Minne- 
apolis Tennis  Club,  one  of  the  pioneer  organizations  in  this  section  of  the 
country.  The  promoters  of  the  new  club  plan  to  take  over  the  grounds  of  the 
Minneapolis  Tennis  Club,  erect  a  permanent  clubhouse  and  appropriate  $5,000 
for  building  new  courts  and  improving  the  old  ones.  The  project  will  be  one 
of  the  biggest  boosts  the  net  game  ever  has  had  in  the  Northwest. 

Tournameat  play  last  season  was  light.  One  of  the  features  of  the  pro- 
gramme was  the  intercity  Red  Cross  matches  between  Minneapolis  and  St. 
Paul,  which  resulted  in  an  even  break.  It  was  announced  that  $1,500  was 
raised,  which  included  Duluth  and  Northfield  in  addition  to  the  twin  cities. 

The  Northwestern  interscholastic  tournament  on  the  courts  of  the  Minneap- 
olis Tennis  Club  opened  the  tourney  season.  Leslie  Johnson,  captain  of  the 
Central  High  School  team  of  Minneapolis,  was  the  winner,  defeating  John 
Franham  of  St.  Paul  Academy  in  a  gruelling  five-set  match,  which  took  three 
hours  to  play. 

The  annual  park  tennis  tournament  was  next  in  line  with  175  players. 
Marjorie  Curtis  won  the  women's  title,  while  Weston  Painter  won  the  men's 
singles,  defeating  Wilfred  Widen,  twice  champion.  In  the  doubles.  Painter  and 
his  partner,  Tom  Qarke,  both  former  Centrid  High  School  players,  were 
victorious. 

Competition  in  the  annual  Northwestern  Tennis  Association  championships, 
on  the  beautiful  Burton  courts  at  Deephaven,  was  featured  by  the  closeness  of 
the  play.  Ward  Burton,  president  of  the  Minneapolis  Tennis  Club,  and  his 
partner,  John  Adams,  Jr.,  won  the  doubles  title,  defeating  Jayne  of  Minne- 
apolis and  E.  Knoche  of  St.  Paul.  Jayne  is  one  of  the  veteran  players  in  this 
section  and  has  won  seven  championships  in  nine  starts  in  the  Northwestern 
championship  tourneys.  The  singles  title  was  won  by  Philip  Brain  of  Minne- 
apolis, who  defeated  John  McGee  of  St.  Paul.  Miss  Alice  Drake  of  St.  Paul 
and  Brain  won  the  mixed  doubles  crown,  winning  from  Jayne  and  Miss  Ethel 
Lee  of  Minneapelis. 

Brain  and  Jayne,  shortly  after  the  Northwestern  tourney,  played  in  the 
Western  Canadian  championships  at  Winnipeg,  winning  the  doubles  title  by 
defeating  Neil  McLaughlin  of  Minneapolis  and  Paul  Bennett  of  Canada.  It  is 
planned  by  Minneapolis  officials  to  arrange  an  international  tournament  this 
season  with  Canada. 

The  1918  championships  were  decided  on  the  St.  Paid  Tennis  Club  courts, 
with  John  McGee  of  St.  Paul  winning  the  final  match  for  the  singles  title  from 
Pegs  Albright,  also  of  St.  Paul  and  former  champion.  The  doubles  was  won 
by  Trafford  Jayne  and  John  Adams,  Jr.,  who  defeated  J.  H.  Ehlers  of  Minne- 
apolis and  Myron  Hutchinson  of  St.  Paul. 

The  war  hit  Minneapolis  tennis  clubs  hard,  with  the  result  that  only  two 
organizations  stood  the  strain.  The  Minneapolis  Tennis  Club  and  the  Kenil- 
worth,  a  family  organization,  are  the  only  ones  left.  More  than  60  per  cent  of 
the  members  of  the  former  club  entered  the  service — a  great  record. 


14S  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Northwestern  Championships 

The  1918  tournament  for  the  Northwestern  championships,  held  on  the  Bur- 
ton courts  and  under  the  auspices  of  the  Minnetonka  Yacht  Club,  at  Lake  Min- 
netonka,  Minn.,  August  3  and  following  days,  brought  out  a  big  field  of  entries 
and  an  excellent  exhibition  of  tennis.  P.  S.  Brain  of  Minneapolis  and  J.  McGee 
of  St.  Paul  fought  it  out  for  the  singles  honors.  Brain  winning  after  five  hard 
sets.  The  doubles  went  to  J.  W.  Adams,  Jr.,  of  Minneapolis  and  W.  C.  Burton 
of  Deephaven,  the  pair  defeating  E.  Knoche  of  St.  Paul  and  T.  N.  Jayne  of 
Minneapolis. 

Miss  Alice  Drake  went  through  the  women's  part  of  the  tournament  without 
the  loss  of  a  set.  She  met  Miss  Josephine  Little  in  the  final  round  of  singles 
and  defeated  her,  6/3,6/0.  Miss  Drake  also,  in  conjunction  with  P.  S.  Brain,

Idaho  State  Championships 

From  the  standpoint  of  entries  the  ninth  annual  tournament  for  the  cham- 
pionships of  Idaho  was  a  keen  disappointment.  In  fact,  the  women's  events 
were  probably  unique  in  the  history  of  tennis  tournaments,  starting  as  they  did 
with  eight  entries  in  singles,  four  teams  in  doubles  and  the  same  number  in 
mixed  doubles.  The  players,  however,  were  unable  to  play  at  the  time  sched- 
uled, with  the  result  that  each  of  these  three  events  went  to  the  winners  by 
default,  not  a  match  being  played.  This  gave  Mrs.  A.  Mortimer  Van  Ostrand 
the  singles  title.  Miss  Mabel  Anderson  and  Mrs.  Forrest  White  the  doubles 
title,  and  Mrs.  Van  Ostrand  and  Kenneth  Simmons  the  mixed  doubles  honors. 

The  men's  singles  title  was  won  by  Kenneth  Simmons,  who  defeated  Feni- 
more  Cady  in  the  final  round,  and  became  champion  by  reason  of  the  failure  of 
Myron  Hutchinson  to  defend  his  title.  The  doubles  went  to  Simmons  and 
Howard  Robinson.    The  summaries:

Pacific  Coast  Tournaments 


Tennis  in  San  Francisco  and  District 

By  R.  J.  Greenberc. 

With  William  Johnston,  John  Strachan,  Clarence  Griffin,  Willis  Davis  and 
Lin  Murray  away  in  the  service  of  their  country,  the  1918  tennis  tournaments 
in  the  vicinity  of  San  Francisco  lacked  the  class  of  play  of  former  years.  It 
was  left  to  the  youngsters  and  vets  to  keep  the  game  alive  and  it  was  chiefly 
due  to  their  enthusiasm  that  the  tournaments  were  carried  on  as  usual,  all  the 
fixtures  for  the  year  being  carried  through  on  schedule. 

Mervyn  Griffin,  youngest  brother  of  Lieutenant  Clarence  J.  Griffin,  and 
Roland  Roberts  carried  oflF  the  major  portion  of  the  honors  for  the  year.  Prior 
to  his  enlistment  in  the  army,  Roberts  annexed  the  San  Francisco  city  and 
Pacific  Coast  titles,  while  Griffin  took  the  Bay  Counties  and  California  State 
and  all  the  junior  events,  until  his  win  of  the  State  title  made  him  ineligible 
for  the  junior  championships.  Roberts  showed  marked  improvement  in  all 
departments  of  his  game,  and  on  his  play  is  clearly  entitled  to  the  honor  of 
ranking  Coast  player  of  the  year.  Seventeen-year-old  Mervyn  Griffin,  the  latest 
star  developed  on  the  public  courts  of  San  Franciso,  gives  promise  of  adding 
more  lustre  to  the  California  name  in  tennis. 

Miss  Helen  Baker  of  San  Francisco  clearly  established  her  claim  as  the  best 
of  the  women  players  in  the  Bay  District.  For  several  years  Miss  Baker  and 
Miss  Anita  Myers  have  been  dividing  the  local  titles  between  them,  no  new 
player  having  come  forward  of  late  to  dispute  their  supremacy.  Miss  Myers 
won  the  Coast  title,  and  Miss  Baker  the  California  State,  Bay  Counties  and 
San  Francisco  city  championships. 

The  Golden  Gate  Tennis  Club,  the  Ladies'  Park  Tennis  Club  and  the  Junior 
Tennis  Club  held  their  tournaments  every  month  as  usual.  One  of  the  features 
of  the  year's  play  was  a  handicap  mixed  doubles  tournament  on  the  Golden 
Gate  Park  courts,  held  under  the  auspices  of  the  San  Francisco  Bulletin,  which 
drew  a  record-breaking  entry  list  of  102  teams.  Miss  Helen  Baker  and  Howard 
Kinsey  were  the  victors,  defeating  Miss  Helen  Law  and  Robert  Kinsey  in  the 
final  in  a  long  drawn  out  battle  that  kept  the  spectators  on  edge.  A  few 
months  later  the  San  Francisco  Call  staged  a  handicap  tournament  for  the 
benefit  of  the  United  War  Work  Fund  at  the  California  Lawn  Tennis  Club. 
The  tournament  was  the  most  ambitious  handicap  affair  ever  undertaken  in  the 
West,  three  events — men's  handicap  singles,  women's  handicap  singles  and 
mixed  doiibles — being  on  the  programme.  The  total  entry  was  170  and  the 
Kinsey  brothers  and  Miss  Helen  Baker  again  proved  their  adeptness  at  the 
handicap  style  of  play,  Howard  Kinsey  winning  the  men's  handicap  singles. 
Miss  Baker  the  women's  handicap  singles  and  Miss  Mary  Louise  Potter  and 
Robert  Kinsey  the  mixed  doubles. 

Tennis  received  considerable  attention  at  the  hands  of  the  athletic  directors 
at  the  Mare  Island  Naval  Training  Camp,  a  few  miles  from  San  Francisco. 
With  the  game  sponsored  and  encouraged  by  Captain  Miller,  commander  of 
the  training  camp.  Captain  Parker  and  Paymaster  Edward  Poore,  Yeoman 
Irving  Karsky  was  appointed  tennis  director  and  was  told  to  "go  to  it."  Two 
fine  asphalt  courts  were  constructed  under  Karsky's  direction  and  each  day  he

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  I53 

had  a  squad  out  on  the  courts  learning  the  ins-and-outs  of  the  game.  On  two 
occasions  a  number  of  San  Francisco  net  stars,  including  Maurice  McLoughlin, 
Roland  Roberts,  Mervyn  Griffin,  Bowie  Detrick,  Helen  Baker  and  Anita  Myers, 
played  in  exhibition  matches  on  the  Navy  Yard  courts. 

The  annual  interclub  battle  was  held  as  usual,  although  the  number  of  clubs 
participating  in  the  race  was  cut  in  half,  due  to  the  fact  that  so  many  of  the 
players  were  playing  a  bigger  game  many  miles  away.  The  league  champion- 
ship was  won  by  the  California  Tennis  Club,  with  the  Golden  Gates  in  second 
position. 

Pacific  Coast  Championships 

Roland  Roberts  of  San  Francisco  won  the  1918  Pacific  Coast  championship 
title,  succeeding  to  the  crown  held  by  William  Johnston,  former  national  cham- 
pion. Miss  Anita  Myers  of  Berkeley  won  the  women's  title,  defeating  Mrs. 
Walter  Ellis  of  Los  Angeles  in  the  final  round,  in  a  close  three-set  battle. 

The  event  was  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Berkeley  Tennis  Club,  beginning 
June  15,  and  drew  the  smallest  entry  in  years.  All  the  stars  who  graced  the 
tournament  in  years  past  were  away  in  the  service  and  it  was  left  to  the 
youngsters  and  veterans  to  carry  on,  which  they  did  with  a  will. 

Roberts  defeated  Victor  Breeden  in  the  final  in  straight  sets.  The  feature 
match  of  the  tournament  occurred  in  the  semi-final  round,  when  Mervyn  Grif- 
fin, California's  latest  tennis  "find,"  all  but  put  the  new  champion  out  of  the 
running  in  a  five-set  encounter.  The  youngster,  however,  came  through  in  good 
style  in  the  junior  singles,  defeating  William  Parker  of  San  Francisco  in 
straight  sets,  6/0,6/0,6/3.     The  summaries:

California  State  Championships 

The  California  State  championships,  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Berkeley  Ten- 
nis Club,  was  the  premier  tennis  event  of  the  1918  season,  far  overshadowing 
in  interest  and  competition  the  Coast  championship,  which  is  supposed  to  take 
precedence.  Mervyn  Griffin,  seventeen  years  of  age  and  brother  of  the  famous 
"Peck,"  won  the  title,  defeating  Byron  Batkin  in  five  sets  in  the  final. 

The  women's  event  furnished  all  the  thrills,  upsets  and  surprises.  The  par- 
ticipants included  two  of  the  nationally  known  Sutton  sisters.  Miss  Florence 
and  Mrs.  B.  0.  Bruce;  Miss  Mayme  McDonald,  Northwest  champion;  Miss 
Anita  Myers,  Pacific  Coast  champion,  and  Miss  Helen  Baker,  who  has  been  the 
most  consistent  winner  of  women's  events  in  the  Bay  Counties.  Against  this 
array  of  talent  Miss  Baker  was  not  conceded  a  chance  to  win,  but  to  the  sur- 
prise of  everyone,  she  defeated  Miss  McDonald,  Mrs.  Bruce  and  Miss  Sutton 
on  successive  days. 

The  doubles  title  was  taken  by  Bowie  Detrick  and  Byron  Batkin,  and  the 
women's  doubles  by  Miss  Florence  Sutton  and  Mrs.  B.  0.  Bruce.  Miss  Florence 
Sutton  and  Mervyn  Griffin  won  the  mixed  doubles,  and  Charles  Stickney  of 
Oakland  won  the  veterans'  singles.     The  summaries:

Bay  Counties  Championships 

The  Bay  Counties  tennis  championships  were  held,  as  usual,  on  the  public 
courts  of  Golden  Gate  Park,  San  Francisco.  Mervyn  Griffin,  seventeen-year-old 
brother  of  the  former  national  doubles  champion,  emerged  the  winner  in  the 
singles,  decisively  defeating  Robert  Kinsey  in  the  final,  6/1,6/2,6/3.  The 
doubles  event  was  disappointing,  a  number  of  the  better  teams  being  compelled 
to  default  because  of  the  influenza  epidemic  which  was  raging  at  the  time. 

No  one  was  prepared  for  the  ultimate  win  of  the  new  champions,  however, 
Tevis  Martin  and  Wilton  Smith,  two  junior  players,  who  defeated  Mervyn 
Griffin  and  Wallace  Bates  in  the  final,  after  the  latter  team  had  led  at  2  sets 
jlove  and  5/2,40/15  in  the  third  set.  Miss  Helen  Baker  won  the  women's  event 
for  the  third  time  in  succession,  thereby  securing  permanent  possession  of  the 
Wickham  Havens  trophy.  

Tennis  in  Southern  California 

By  H.  F.  Weller. 

The  lawn  tennis  season  of  1918  in  Southern  California,  while  perhaps  a 
trifle  below  the  usual  standard  in  class  and  number  of  entries  in  each  of  the 
tournaments,  proved  a  surprise  to  those  who  had  expected  the  game  to  languish 
because  of  the  war. 

Nine  important  tournaments  were  held  during  the  season,  starting  with  the 
Coronado  affair  in  January  and  ending  with  the  Los  Angeles  Country  Club 
championships  in  November  and  December.  In  addition  to  these  nine  there 
were  numerous  invitation  and  exhibition  tournaments  held,  many  of  them 
benefit  affairs  for  the  Red  Cross  or  some  other  war  fund.  The  proceeds  from 
these  special  events  reached  a  very  considerable  sum  and  the  game  takes  its 
place  well  up  among  other  branches  of  sport  as  a  contributor  to  war  activities. 

Following  the  Coronado  tournament  in  January,  the  Southern  California  clay 
court  championship  was  held  in  Los  Angeles,  February  7-16,  on  the  courts  of 
the  Hotel  Leighton  in  Los  Angeles,  and  brought  out  a  fairly  large  entry.  Vic- 
tory in  the  singles  event  went  to  Kenneth  Hawks,  formerly  of  Cornell,  and  in 
the  doubles  to  Ray  Greenberg  of  San  Francisco  and  Ralph  Sindorf  of  Los 
Angeles.     Miss  Jessie  Grieve  of   Pasadena  won  the  women's  singles. 

The  Southern  California  handicap  tournament,  held  in  the  latter  part  of 
May,  produced  many  close  matches.  Simpson  M.  Sinsabaugh,  minus  30, 
defeated  William  Balthis,  scratch,  in  the  final  round,  6/2,2/6,10/8.  Miss  Hilda 
Blatz,  plus  15,  won  the  singles  from  Miss  Jessie  Grieve,  minus  30,  in  two  well 
played  sets,  7/5,6/4.  R.  Reinke  and  P.  Hardeman  won  the  men's  open  doubles 
from  K.  Hawks  and  F.  Winne,  the  final  match  ending,  6/4,7/5. 

The  Formosa  Club  tournament  in  Hollywood,  Los  Angeles,  was  played  in 
June.  The  Pacific  Coast  doubles  in  July,  of  course,  was  less  interesting  than 
usual,  because  of  the  absence  of  San  Francisco  and  Los  Angeles  stars  with  the 
army  and  naval  forces.  The  Southern  California  open  championship  was  held 
in  August  and  *he  city  championship  in  September. 

The  Los  Angeles  County  Liberty  Fair  championship  tournament,  completed 
Saturday,  December  28,  at  Exposition  Park,  brought  out  the  largest  list  of 
entries  ever  assembled  for  a  similar  series,  and  in  the  men's  singles  alone  the 
list  ran  far  above  any  received  for  any  tournament  in  recent  years. 

Despite  the  absence  of  many  stars  in  either  army  or  navy  service,  there  was 
enough  "class"  in  evidence  to  make  the  play  decidedly  interesting  and  some 


158  SPALDING'S   LAWN   TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

hard  fought  matches  productive  of  brilliant  tennis  were  well  sprinkled  through 
the  schedule. 

Eugene  A.  Warren  won  his  way  through  in  the  men's  singles  to  the  title 
after  traveling  a  road  beset  with  such  steady  stars  as  Walter  Bowers,  Simpson 
Sinsabaugh  and  Applewhite.     Following  are  the  finals  winners: 

Men's  Singles— Eugene  A.  Warren  d.  Hal  Braly,  6/2,6/1.  Women's  Singles— Mrs.  W. 
M.  Henry  d.  Mrs.  J.  A.  Rameson,  3/6,6/3,6/3.  Men's  Doubles— Warren  and  Adams  d. 
Braly  and  Sinsabaugh,  6/3,6/3.  Mixed  Doubles— Mrs.  Henry  and  Sinsabaugh  d.  Mrs. 
Rameson  and  Ketchum,  8/6,8/6.  Junior  Singles— Deffebach  d.  Bullock,  2/6,6/4,8/6.  Junior 
Doubles— Ferrandini  and  Hunley  d.  Stillwell  and  Berry,  5/7,6/2,6/3.  Boys'  Singles— 
Stillwell  d.  Bryant,  6/1,9/7.  Boys'  Doubles— Gardner  and  Stillwell  d.  Hookstratten  and 
Wheaton,   6/2,7/5. 

Due  to  the  disastrous  fire  which  visited  the  picturesque  Ojai  Valley  in  the 
latter  part  of  1917,  it  was  impossible  to  stage  this  popular  tourney  in  the 
Valley,  and  for  a  time  it  seemed  as  if  the  twenty-fourth  annual  interscholastic 
tournament  would  not  be  held;  but  finally  the  Southern  California  Lawn  Ten- 
nis Association,  with  the  sanction  of  the  Ojai  Valley  Tennis  Club  and  the 
Southern  California  Interscholastic  Federation,  determined  to  undertake  to 
have  the  play  take  place  in  Los  Angeles. 

The  tournament  was  held  on  the  four  cement  courts  of  the  Y.M.C.A.  ath- 
letic field  in  Los  Angeles,  April  24-27.  This  was  the  first  time  since  the  insti- 
tution of  the  event  that  it  had  been  held  elsewhere  than  on  the  Thacher  School 
courts.  The  large  entry  list  showed  conclusively  that  the  Association's  effort 
to  perpetuate  this  tournament  was  a  wise  move.    The  finalists  follow: 

Men's  Open  Singles — Frank  P.  Winne  d.  Robert  Rager,  6/3,6/4.  Men's  Open  Doubles- 
Kenneth  Hawks  and  Frank  Winne  d.  Simpson  M.  Sinsabaugli  and  James  Davies,  8/6,6/3. 
Women's  Open  Singles— Miss  Jessie  Grieve  d.  Mrs.  Yager,  10/8,1/6,7/5.  Mixed  Doubles- 
Miss  Marion  Williams  and  S.  M.  Sinsabaugh  d.  Mrs.  Yager  and  George  Sinclair,  6/3,10/8. 
Boys'  Interscholastic  Singles — Lyle  Hackney  (Pasadena  H.S'.)  d.  Charles  Deffebach  (Man- 
ual Arts  H.S.),  6/3,6/3.  Boys'  Interseliolastic  Doubles— Edw.  Simmons  and  David  Brieker 
(Los  Angeles  H.S.)  d.  Jerome  and  Johnson  (Santa  Ana  H.S.),  6/3,6/3.  Girls'  Interscho- 
lastic Singles— Miss  Marion  Williams  (Bishops)  d.  Miss  Helen  Huff  (Alhambra),  6/0,6/2. 
Girls'  Interscholastic  Doubles — Miss  Helen  Huff  and  Miss  Dorothy  Lane  (Alhambra)  d. 
Miss  G.  Kelley  and  Miss  Lynn  (So.  Pasadena),  6/1,6/4.  James  Davies  won  the  intercol- 
legiate singles  and  Leon  Godshall  and   Ralph   Sindorf   took   the   doubles. 

California  Lawn  Tennis  Club,  San  Francisco. — The  team  representing  this  club  emerged 
victors  in  the  third  annual  Northern  California  interclub  event.  The  number  of  clubs 
entered  totaled  six,  just  one-half  the  entry  of  the  previous  year.  California's  closest 
competitors  were  the  Golden  Gates  of  the  same  city,  who,  as  in  a  previous  year, 
defeated  the  league  champions,  but  fell  before  some  team  lower  down  in  the  percentage 
table  because  some  of  their  men  failed  to  put  in  an  appearance.  Al  Rosenberg,  Bowie 
Detriok,  Howard  Kinsey,  Robert  Kinsey  and  Lloyd  Baldwin  were  the  players  on  whom 
the  California  Club  i-elied  to  bring  home  the  championship  and  another  win  on  the  beau- 
tiful Spalding   trophy.     Standing   of  the   clubs:

Los  Angeles  (Gal.)  City  Championships,— The  tournament  for  the  Los  Angeles  cham- 
pionships brought  out  a  big  field  of  contestants  and  the  play  throughout  was  sharp  and 
interesting.  In  tlie  singles  Perry  E.  Jones  defeated  Fred  Adams  in  the  final  round,  9/7, 
3/6,6/3,  while  S.  M.  Sinsabaugh  and  Nat  Browne  disposed  of  Jones  and  Roland  Reinke 
in  the  final,  6/4,6/1.  Miss  Gladys  Widdowson  defeated  Mrs.  J.  A.  Rameson  in  the  final 
of  the  women's  singles,  6/0,7/5,  and  Mrs.  Rameson  and  Sinsabaugh  put  out  Mrs.  Wid- 
dowson and  Jones  in  the  final  of  the  mixed   doubles,   6/2,3/6,6/4. 

Uezico's  Extraordinary  Singles  Tournament. — This  tournament,  which  was  held  under 
the  auspices  of  the  Junior  Club  of  Mexico  last  December,  attracted  an  entry  list  of  ninety- 
six  players,  sixty-four  of  which  participated  in  the  matches.  Claude  Butlin,  who  is  rated 
as  the  best  player  in  that  country,  had  no  trouble  in  carrying  off  the  honors,  his  prin- 
cipal opponent  being  Carlos  Contrevas,  whom  he  defeated  in  the  final  round,  6/1,6/2,7/5. 
Butlin  is  an  Englishman  by  birth,  but  for  many  years  has  made  Mexico  his  home.  Some 
time  ago  Butlin  participated  in  the  Texas  State  championship  and  won  the  title.

Pacific  Northwest  Tournaments 


Pacific  Northwest  Championsliips 

War  had  its  efifect  on  the  entries  to  the  Pacific  Northwest  championships, 
eld  on  the  courts  of  the  Tacoma  Lawn  Tennis  Club,  Tacoma,  Wash.,  during 
le  week  of  July  29,  1918,  owing  to  many  Western  players  being  at  the  front 
ad  at  training  camps;  but  what  the  list  lacked  in  numbers  was  offset  by  the 
uality   of   tennis    displayed. 

Lieut.  H.  C.  Breck,  who  was  stationed  at  Camp  Lewis,  just  outside  of 
acoma,  won  the  championship  and  Thome  Cup  in  singles,  defeating  Lieut, 
[erbert  Hahn,  a  member  of  the  regular  army,  after  a  hard  played  four-set 
latch.  The  doubles  was  taken  by  Halin  and  Richards,  who  won  from  W.  Scott 
nd  R.  A.  Wabraushek  in  one  of  the  best  matches  of  the  tournament. 
I  The  men's  sectional  doubles  went  to  Breck  and  Pringle,  who  defeated  Brown 
nd  Wabraushek  after  five  nip-and-tuck  sets  in  the  final  round. 

Miss  Sara  Livingstone  and  Miss  Mayme  McDonald  fought  it  out  as  they  have 
one  for  many  years  in  the  women's  singles,  but  this  time  Miss  McDonald 
ecured  the  honors.  The  doubles  went  to  Miss  McDonald  and  Miss  Schreiner. 
Irs.  Cushing  and  Brant  Wickersham  took  the  mixed  doubles.    The  summaries:

Oregon  State  Championships 

By  a.  R.  Munger. 

e  nineteenth  annual  Oregon  State  tournament,  at  the  Irvington  Club,  Port- 
July  22-27,   1918,  was  favored  with  nearly  as  large  a  list  of  entries  and 
^ps  with  fully  as  fine  a  display  of  tennis  as  in  the  events  held  during  the 
of  peace.     Whatever  was  lacking  in  the  men's  events  due  to  the  absence 
ominent  players  in  the  service  of  their  country,  was  compensated  for  by 
appearance    of    several    of    the    best    of    the    California    and    Washington 
iiine  stars,  including  Miss  Mayme  McDonald  of  Seattle,  Mrs.  Walter  Ellis 
bs  Angeles  and  Mrs.  J.  C.  Cushing  of  Oakland.     Miss  McDonald  won  the 
without  the  loss  of  a  set,  defeating  Mrs.   Ellis  in  a  hard-fought  contest, 
taking   the   final   from    Miss   Stella    Fording   of    Portland,   6/2,6/2.      Mrs. 
with  G.   A.  Ganohl,   also   of  Los   Angeles,  won   the  mixed   doubles,  and 
McDonald  paired  with  Mrs.  Cushing  took  the  women's  doiiljle's  event. 
ilter  A.  Goss,  who  is  one  of  the  tennis  veterans  of  the  Northwest,  scored 
itory  in  the  final  of  the  men's  singles  over  B.  H.  Wickersham  of  Tacoma, 
thereby  became  permanent  holder  of  the  Fiske  Cup,  a  well  known  trophy

Toronto  Patriotic  Tournament 

For  the  first  time  since  the  war  began,  tournament  playing  was  resumel 
Toronto,  Can.,  sponsored  by  the  Toronto  Lawn  Tennis  Club  and  under 
Cross  auspices.  Play  began  on  June  29  and  ended  July  6,  1918.  The  qui 
of  tennis  displayed  was,  generally  speaking,  the  best  ever  seen  in  Toronto, 
the  attendance  throughout  was  very  large.  Players  from  the  American  sid 
the  border  added  materially  to  the  interest  in  the  competition.  They  i 
Lieut.  G.  F.  Touchard,  a  member  of  the  Royal  Flying  Corps  stationed  at  C 
Borden,  who  came  to  the  courts  each  day  by  plane,  and  Cecil  and  Ge

Junior  Tournaments 

A  few  years  ago  junior  tennis  received  scant  courtesy  at  many  of  the  clubs. 
To-day  there  are  many  junior  players  of  quality,  and  it  is  mainly  due  to  the 
efforts  of  such  prominent  tennis  advocates  as  Fred  B.  Alexander  and  Julian  S. 
Myrick  that  this  change  has  been  brought  about. 

Alexander  initiated  junior  tennis  tournaments  in  the  metropolitan  district 
and  took  a  personal  interest  in  the  young  players.  Myrick  conceived  the  idea 
of  forming  tennis  centers  throughout  the  United  States,  and  through  this  method 
hundreds  of  boys  took  up  the  game  in  earnest  and  developed  their  skill. 

Impetus  was  added  to  the  movement  by  the  offering  of  the  Goddard  Weld 
Saunders  championship  bowl,  a  massive  silver  trophy,  gold  lined.  Mr.  and  Mrs. 
H.  R.  Saunder?  of  New  York  City,  who  frequently  accompanied  their  son  while 
he  Wis  gaining  tournament  experience,  felt  that  the  youngsters  should  1  e  given 
something  to  strive  for,  and  the  offer  of  the  championship  bowl  resulted. 


NATIONAL    JUNIOR    CHAMPIONSHIP    TROPHY    AND    DONOR. 

The  bowl  is  a  permanent  trophy  and  cannot  pass  into  the  possession  of  any 
player.  It  was  presented  in  1914  by  Goddard  Weld  Saunders,  then  fourteen 
years  of  age,  and  was  originally  deeded  to  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club  as  the 
emblem  of  metropolitan  junior  tennis  championship.  Two  years  later  it  was 
transferred  by  mutual  agreement  to  the  National  Association,  thus  becoming 
the  national  trophy.  This  bowl  was  designed  and  executed  by  Black,  Starr  & 
Frost,  and  although  purposely  made  vnth  a  plain  surface  in  order  to  provide 
room  for  names  for  many  years  to  come,  its  lines  are  graceful  and  beautiful, 
the  raised  lettering  of  the  dedicatory  inscription  proving  a  fine  finishing  touch. 
The  bowl  measures  about  16  1-2  inches  across.  The  names  of  the  following 
winners  have  so  far  been  inscribed  on  the  bowl:  1914,  Harold  A.  Throck- 
morton; 1915,  Charles  S.  Garland;  1916,  Harold  A.  Throckmorton;  1917, 
Charles  S.  Garland;   1918,  Harold  L.  Taylor. 

The  donor  of  this  trophy  is  himself  an  enthusiastic  player  of  great  promise, 
having  won  several  prizes.  He  ib  now  a  sophomore  at  Columbia  and  is  a 
member  of  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club  and  other  clubs.

174  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL, 


Ranking  Committee's  Report 

To    the   Executive    Committee    of    the    United    States   National   Lawn    Tennis 
Association: 

Herewith  your  committee  presents  class  lists  in  men's  singles  and  men's 
doubles  for  players  and  teams  who  participated  in  three  or  more  tennis  tour- 
naments during  the  season  of  1918. 

By  request  of  the  California  Lawn  Tennis  Association,  Pacific  Coast  players 
not  participating  in  Eastern  tournaments  were  not  classed.  By  unanimous  con- 
sent of  the  Ranking  Committee  a  few  players  were  classed  who  participated  in 
the  national  championship  and  one  other  tournament.  Please  note  the  arrange- 
ment in  classes  as  directed  by  the  new  rules. 

For  the  information  of  the  Executive  Committee,  in  addition  to  the  class 
grouping  we  have  given  the  computed  rating  and  relative  number  (based  on 
rating)  of  each  player  or  team  listed.  In  view  of  the  fact  that  the  ratings  and 
relative  positions  have  been  determined  by  the  law  of  averages  and  have  not 
been  left  to  the  guesses  or  vague  opinions  of  our  committee,  we  deplore  the 
fact,  if  it  is  a  fact,  that  the  actual  number  and  rating  of  each  player  may  not 
be  published  as  well  as  his  classing. 

It  is  worthy  of  note  that  while  the  difference  of  one  or  two  points  in  rating 
generally  does  not  indicate  a  difference  in  class,  it  is  always  well  in  competi- 
tive sport  to  recognize  the  better  record. 

For  your  further  information  we  hand  you  a  brief  summary  of  our  methods 
of  arriving  at  a  player's  rating,  together  with  tentative  rules,  tables,  etc. 

In  harmony  with  the  1916  Ranking  Committee's  recommendations,  we  sug- 
gest the  appointment  of  a  committee  to  draw  rules  and  regulations  as  to  the 
several  variables  to  be  used,  such  as  weight  of  tournaments,  unfitness  of  con- 
testants, difference  of  rating  for  various  scores,  etc.  Upon  the  determination 
of  certain  standards  of  comparison,  all  players  judged  by  these  standards  will 
be  on  an  equal  basis  and  the  results  should  be  satisfactory. 

The  labors  of  the  Ranking  Committee  for  1918  have  been  greatly  reduced  by 
the  efficient  methods  of  the  Field  Secretary's  office  in  collecting  and  arranging 
data  for  our  consideration. 

The  committee  wishes  to  thank  the  Women's  Ranking  Committee,  composed 
of  Mrs.  William  H.  Pouch,  chairman;  Miss  Edith  B.  Handy  and  Mrs.  Benjamin 
E.  Cole,  for  its  efficient  aid. 

Respectfully  submitted, 

Walter  T.  Hayes, 

Conrad  B.  Doyle, 

Paul  W.  Gibbons, 

Harry  C.  Johnson, 

Abraham  Bassford,  Jr.,  Chairman. 

Paul  B.  Williams,  Secretary. 

A  minority  -eport  was  presented  by  Paul  W.  Gibbons,  it  differing  from  the 
majority  repc  .  only  in  giving  No.  1  position  to  W.  T.  Tilden,  Jr. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  175 

SUGGESTED   RULES    FOR   DETERMINATION    OF   TENNIS   RATING   FOR   ANY   PLAYER. 

1.  Players   to   be   considered  are   first   placed   in  their   approximate    class, 
e.,  0-10,  10-20— to  90-100. 

2.  Using  the  approximate  class  list  and  rating  tables  (appended)  rating  for 
;ach  representative  match  should  be  computed.  However,  in  no  case  shall  the 
omputed  difference  in  rate  for  any  match  exceed  by  20  points  the  difference 

shown  in  the  established  approximate  class. 

3.  The  average  rating  for  each  tournament  played  may  then  be  computed. 

4.  The  year's  prime  rate  may  then  be  computed  by  averaging  the  player's 
ournament  ratings  and  giving  the  established  weight  for  each  tournament. 

5.  The  "weight"  given  to  tournament  ratings  in  the  general  average  is  to  be 
IS  follows: 

(a)  National   Championship    4 

(b)  Clay  Court  Championship 3 

(c)  *Sectional  Championship  2 

(d)  Other  tournaments   1 

*Soulhaiiipton,   Newport,   etc.,  are  considered  as  sectional  championships. 

6.  Final  rating  may  then  be  established  by  using  the  aforementioned  meth- 
ods together  with  the  "prime  rating"  instead  of  the  "approximate  rating"  as  a 
basis  for  estimating. 

NOTES. 

A.  The  approximate  class  is  generally  determined  from  previous  ranking 
[lists  and  knowledge  of  a  player's  ability. 

B.  The  prime  rate  ordinarily  will  be  sufficient  to  determine  a  player's  rank. 
However,  when  two  players  are  very  evenly  matched,  their  relative  standing 
must  be  determined  by  a  second  rating  as  explained  in  Rule  6.

At  the  meeting  of  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  U.S.N. L.T.A.-  held  Feb- 
ruary 7,  1919,  Mr.  Bassford,  chairman  of  the  Ranking  Committee,  brought  up 
the  question  of  readjusting  the  ranking  of  A.  P.  Hubbell  of  Chicago,  at  the 
request  of  Mr.  Hayes. 

It  was  suggested  that  Mr.  Hubbell  be  placed  in  the  same  class  with  Edward 
Oelsner,  especially  as  the  Western  Association  had  ranked  these  men  and 
placed  them  about  as  suggested. 

It  was  recommended  that  Mr.  Hubbell  be  placed  No.  24  instead  of  19,  and 
Mr.  Oelsner  25.  That  action  reduced  Clasj  7  to  four  men  and  increased  Class 
8  to   eight   players.     The   recommendation   was   approved.

WOMEN'S  RANKING 

In  presenting  its  report-  the  Women's  Ranking  Committee,  composed  of  M 
W.  H.  Pouch,  Miss  Edith  B.  Handy  and  Mrs.  B.  E.  Cole,  expressed  regret  tl 
at  least  two  extremely  promising  players  on  the  Pacific  Coast  were  not  cc 
sidered.  This  was  in  conformity  with  the  request  of  the  California  Lai 
Tennis  Association  that  those  who  did  not  play  in  Eastern  tournaments 
omitted  from  the  ranking.  j 

It  is  to  be  regretted  that  so  many  players  of  national  fame  must  be  omitt( 
even  from  the  list  of  those  not  ranked  on  account  of  insufficient  data,  I 
owing  to  the  fact  that  they  have  played  in  no  tournaments  the  committee  1 
no  choice  in  the  matter. 


SPAI-DING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  179^

New  Jersey,  Heights  Casino  indoor,  national  indoor  and  national  champion-

The  following  are  mentioned  as  "not  ranked  on  account  of  insufficient  data": 
Miss  Mary  K.  Browne,  Los  Angeles;  Miss  Natalie  Browning,  Tarrytown;  Mrs. 
B.  F.  Briggs,  Pelham  Manor,  N.  Y. ;  Mrs.  B.  0.  Bruce,  Los  Angeles;  Miss

dale,  N.  Y.;  Miss  Evelyn  Seavey,  Kansas  City;  Miss  Florence  Sutton,  Los

In  view  of  the  fact  that  the  women's  ranking  had  been  made  according  to 
the  old  system  and  not  according  to  the  classes  established  by  a  vote  at  the 
annual  meeting,  a  readjustment  of  the  women's  ranking  to  make  it  conform  to 
the  system  used  in  ranking  the  men  was  approved.  It  was  voted  to  recom-

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  207 

Annual  Meeting 

The  thirty-eighth  annual  meeting  of  the  United  States  Lawn  Tennis  Associa- 
n  was  marked  by  an  unusually  harmonious  atmosphere,  resulting,  no  doubt, 
im  the  successful  termination  of  the  war  and  the  general  feeling  that  discord 
uld  be  out  of  place.  As  a  consequence  the  routine  business  of  the  meeting 
IS  transacted  with  dispatch,  returning  president  Major  George  T.  Adee  pre- 
ling  in  his  usual  capable  manner. 

The  reports  of  the  Secretary,  the  Treasurer,  the  Investment  Committee,  and 
e  Field  Secretary  were  read  and  approved.  Special  committees  then  reported, 
ce-President  Myrick  speaking  for  the  Tennis  Ambulance  Committee.  A. 
issford  gave  the  Men's  Ranking  Committee  report,  including  the  ranking  of 
•)men.  After  some  discussion  the  committee  was  instructed  to  include  in  its 
ture  reports  the  ranking  of  juniors  and  boys,  while  the  Women's  Sub- 
jmmittee,  in  charge  of  the  women's  ranking,  was  requested  to  rank  the  girls. 
The  plan  of  holding  sectional  doubles  was  resumed.  The  committee  recom- 
ended  that  the  challenge  round  be  included  as  part  of  the  tournament,  which 
allotted  for  1919  to  the  Longwood  Cricket  Club  of  Boston.  The  Committee 
1  the  Development  of  Juniors  and  Boys,  which  throughout  the  war  received 
e  active  co-operation  of  Vice-President  Myrick,  made  a  report  which  met  with 
sneral  approval.  Over  fifty  successful  tournaments  had  been  held  and  sub- 
antial  progress  made.  After  considerable  discussion  and  a  hurried  meeting 
the  committee,  a  change  was  made  in  the  rule  regulating  the  age  of  the  con- 
stants. Junior  championships  were  made  eligible  to  juniors  who  have  not 
lached  their  eighteenth  birthday  prior  to  March  of  the  year  of  competition, 
hile  for  boys  the  time  was  fixed  at  their  fifteenth  birthday. 
Chairman  Dlonne  of  the  Ball  Committee  made  several  commendatory  remarks 
ilative  to  the  quality  of  the  balls  adopted  for  use  in  the  national  champion- 
lips  and  recommended  competition  among  ball  manufacturers. 
The  Committee  on  Equalization  of  Voting  Power  stated  that  an  inequality  of 
Jting  power  does  exist  and  recommended  that  the  committee  be  given  further 
me  in  which  to  offer  a  solution  to  the  problem. 

The  Nominating  Committee's  report  met  with  no  opposition,  the  following 
fficers  being  elected:  President,  George  T.  Adee,  New  York;  vice-president, 
ulian  S.  Myrick,  New  York;  secretary,  Edwin  F.  Torrey,  Clinton,  N.  Y.; 
reasurer,  Alfred  H.  Chapin,  Boston,  Mass. 

After  a  session  of  three  hours  the  meeting  adjourned  to  the  banquet  hall, 
?here  the  Victory  Dinner  was  celebrated  with  great  enthusiasm  and  good- 
ellowship.

ARTICLE  I.

(i)   Clubs. 

(2)  Active  Associations. 

(3)  Allied  Associations. 

(4)  Park  Associations. 

Allied  associations  shall  consist  of  associations  of  schools  or  colleges,  but 
such  associations,  if  they  so  desire,  may  become  active  associations  by 
notifying  the  Secretary  of  the  National  Association  and  paying  the  dues 
for  an  active  association.  Active  associations  shall  consist, of  all  associa- 
tions other  than  allied  and  park  associations  and  in  each  case  the  limits  of 
an  active  association  shall  necessarily  exclude  to  that  extent  the  limits  of 
every  other  association.  Park  associations  shall  consist  of  associations  of 
parks,  not  more  than  one  association  from  any  one  city,  and  approved  by 
the  park  commissioner. 

Sec.  2.  An  association,  either  (2)  or  (3),  shall  consist  of  five  or  more 
individual  clubs,  any  one  of  which  may  or  may  not  be  itself  a  member 
directly  of  the  National  Association.  Each  club  shall  at  all  meetings  be 
entitled  to  one  vote.  Each  active  association  shall  be  entitled  to  two  votes 
and  to  one  additional  vote  for  every  five  clubs  or  fraction  thereof  mem- 
bers of  it  over  ten.  Allied  and  park  associations  shall  not  be  entitled  to 
any  vote.  No  club  being  itself  a  member  of  the  National  Association  shall 
be  counted  as  a  member  of  an  active  association  in  determining  the  number 
of  votes  which  may  be  cast  by  such  association.  No  member  of  the 
National  Association  in  arrears  or  failing  to  have  paid  its  fiscal  dues  by 
the  first  of  February  each  year  preceding  the  annual  meeting,  shall  be 
entitled  to  vote  at  such  meeting,  nor  shall  such  club  be  awarded  an  offi- 
cially sanctioned  tournament  held  under  the  auspices  of  the  United  States 
National  Lawn  Tennis  Association. 

Sec.  3.  On  or  before  the  first  day  of  January  in  each  year,  each  sub- 
association  shall  send  to  the  Secretary  of  the  National  Association  the 
names  and  addresses  of  its  secretary  and  treasurer  and  a  list  of  the  clubs 
belonging  to  it  on  December  ist  preceding  (with  the  name  and  address 
of  each  club's  secretary),  and  each  club  directly  a  member  of  the  National 
Association  shall  send  to  the  Secretary  of  the  National  Association  the 
names  and  addresses  of  its  secretary  and  treasurer,  holding  office  on 
December  ist  preceding.  The  secretary  of  each  association  shall  notify 
the  Secretary  of  the  National  Association  of  any  changes  in  its  member- 
ship immediately  upon  their  occurrence.

SPALDING'S   LAWN   TENNIS   ANNUAL.  213 

of  the  applicant,  and  signed  by  the  proper  officer  of  the  club  or  associa- 
tion making  the  proposal,  and  shall  give  such  information  with  regard  to 
membership,  grounds,  etc.,  as  shall  be  required  by  the  Executive  Com- 
mittee. Where  the  applicant  is  an  association,  the  names  and  addresses  of 
each  of  its  members  shall  be  given  with  the  application,  together  with  a 
statement  of  the  limits  that  it  desires  to   represent. 

Sec.  2.  The  Executive  Committee  shall  have  full  power  to  elect  candi- 
dates for  membership,  except  that  no  association  shall  be  deemed  a  mem- 
ber whose  limits  shall  conflict  with  those  of  any  other  association  until  its 
election  be  confirmed  by  a  two-thirds  vote  at  the  annual  meeting  of  the 
National  Association,  or  the  associations  upon  whose  limits  it  encroaches 
consent  to  such  encroachment.  The  election  to  membership  of  such  an 
association  automatically  decreases  the  limits  of  other  associations  to  such 
an  extent  as  shall  preclude   a   conflict   of  limits. 

Sec.  3.  Dues,  etc. — The  annual  dues  to  the  National  Association  in 
the  case  of  clubs  shall  be  ten  dollars  ($10)  and  in  the  case  of  active  asso-

addition  be  fifteen  dollars  ($15)  for  every  five  clubs  or  fraction  thereof 
above  ten.  Allied  and  park  associations  shall  not  be  required  to  pay  any 
annual  dues.  No  club  or  association  shall  be  allowed  the  privilege  of  a 
member  until  after  its  first  annual  dues  have  been  paid  and  no  club  shall  be 
entitled  to  a  vote  at  the  annual  meeting  of  the  National  Association  unless

the  National  Association  shall  begin  February  ist.  All  dues  for  the  ensu- 
ing year  are  payable  on  or  before  May    ist. 

Sec.  4.  Limits  of  Payments,  etc. — Any  club  or  association  which  shall 
fail  to  have  paid  its  annual  dues  on  or  before  June  ist  may  be  debarred 
from  the  privileges  of  a  member  by  the  Executive  Committee  until  the 
same  are  paid,  and,  at  their  discretion,  may  be  dropped  from  the  roll. 

ARTICLE  IV. 

RESIGNATIONS,    EXPULSIONS,    ETC. 

Section  i.  Resignations,  etc. — Any  member  wishing  to  resign  must  do

of  dues  for  the  ensuing  year.

after provided  for,  shall  have  the  power  to  suspend  or  expel  any  member 
which  may  nejjlect  or  refuse  a  strict  and  honorable  compliance  with  its 
Constitution,  By-Laws,  etc.,  or  which  shall,  by  its  conduct,  bring  reproach 
or  disgrace  upon  tlie  National  Association;  or  which  shall,  being  itself  an 
association,  retain  as  one  of  its  members  any  club  objected  to  by  notice  in 
writing  by  the  Executive  Committee,  subject  to  the  right  of  any  member,

unanimous  vote  of  the  Ranking  Committee,  occasional  exceptions  to  this 
rule  may  be  made.  An  individual  or  team,  however,  need  not  necessarily 
be  ranked  because  of  having  qualified  under  this  rule,  if  in  the  opinion  of  a 
majority  of  the  committee  the  data  furnished  by  the  record  in  question  is 
insufficient  for  the  purpose  or  the  standard  of  play  does  not  warrant  any- 
ranking. 

(6)  The  rankings  shall  be  based  solely  upon  the  records  of  the  players 
for  the  season  under  consideration  and  not  upon  the  opinion  of  the  Ranking 
Committee.  Middle  and  late  season  performance  shall  be  given  greater 
consideration  than  that  of  the  early  season. 

(7)  Any  individual  or  team  may  be  -anked  irrespective  of  nationality  or 
place  of  residence. 

(8)  The  winners  of  national  championships  shall  be  ranked  on  their  sea- 
son's records  as  are  other  players  and  shall  not  be  arbitrarily  placed  at  the 


222  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

head  of  the  rankings,  but  in  a  comparison  of  their  records  with  those  of 
other  players,  they  shall  be  given  the  benefit  of  any  reasonable  doubt  as  to 
the  relative  merits  of  such  records. 

(9)  The  Ranking  Committee  shall  submit  its  report  to  the  Executive  Com- 
mittee at  the  meeting  of  the  Executive  Committee  held  in  December  of  the 
year  for  which  the  rankings  are  made.  The  Executive  Committee  may  alter 
the  rankings  as  submitted. 

(10)  Members  of  the  Ranking  Committee  shall  not  divulge  any  of  the 
results  of  their  deliberations  or  any  other  information  concerning  the  rank- 
ings prior  to  the  publication  thereof  by  the  Executive   Committee. 

(11)  The  Ranking  Committee's  report  shall  be  published  in  the  official 
organ  of  the  U.S.N.L.T.A.  in  the  first  issue  thereof  following  the  meeting  of 
the  Executive  Committee  at  which  the  report  is  submitted. 

(12)  The  rankings  shall  be  made  by  computing  the  ratings  and  relative 
positions  of  the  players  or  teams  by  the  law  of  averages  based  on  the 
following  system: 

RULES  TO  DETERMINE  PLAYERS'  RATING 

1  The  players  to  be  considered  are  first  placed  in  their  approximate 
class;  1.  e.,  0-10,  10-20,  to  90-100. 

2.  Using  the  approximate  class  list  and  rating  tables  (appended),  rating 
for  each  representative  match  should  be  computed.  However,  in  no  case 
shall  the  computed  difference  in  rate  for  any  match  exceed  by  20  points  the 
difference  shown  in  the  established  approximate  class  or  prime  rate.  This 
rule  is  made  to  prevent  one  match  which  is  an  absolute  reversal  of  form 
from  ruining  a  player's  season-record.  (Apphcation:  Player  H  (0)  defeats 
Player  S  (10),  6/2,6/0,6/0.  For  this  match,  therefore,  H's  rating  is  minus  40 
and  S's  rating  is  plus  50.  But  under  Rule  2  the  difference  cannot  be  more 
than  20  points  plus  the  difference  between  the  approximate  class  ratings, 
which  in  this  case  is  10.  Therefore  the  computed  difference  in  rating  is  30 
and  the  ratings  are:  H,  minus  20;   S,  plus  30.) 

3.  The  average  (or  prime)  rating  for  each  tournament  is  computed  by 
averaging  the  rates  obtained  in  the  several  matches  played. 

4.  The  year's  prime  rate  is  computed  by  averaging  the  player's  tourna- 
ment ratings,   using  the  weight  established   for  each  tournament. 

5.  The  weight  given  tournament  ratings  in  the  general  average  is  to  be 
as  follows: 

National    championship    4 

Clay    court    championship 3 

Sectional  championship    2 

Other  tournaments    1 

(Note — In  addition  to  the  championships  of  sections  as  designated  t)y  he 
constitution  of  the  U.S.N.L.T.A.,  the  following  events  shall  have  the  weight 
of  "sectional"  championships:  Seabright,  Southampton,  Rockaway,  New- 
port, Philadelphia  and  District,  Western  Pennsylvania,   Central  States.) 

6.  Final  rating  is  established  by  using  the  aforementioned  methods 
together  with  the  prime  rating  instead  of  the  approximate  class  as  a  basis 
for  estimating. 

NOTES. 

A.  The  approximate  class  is  generally  determined  from  previous  ranking- 
lists  and  knowledge  of  a  player's  ability. 

B.  The  prime  rate  ordinarily  will  be  sufficient  to  determme  a  player  s 
rank.  However,  when  two  players  are  very  evenly  matched,  their  relative 
standing  must  be  determined  by  a  second  rating  as  explained  in  Rule  6.

Best  in  3-set  matches.  Best  in  5-set  matches.

EXAMPLE. 

Suppose  there  are  only  four  players— A,  B,  C  and  D— entered  in  a  tour- 
nament. They  are  assumed  to  have  the  following  approximate  classification 
(see  Rule  1) : 

A  is  a  player  whose  class  is  known  to  be  about  40. 

B  is  a  player  whose  class  is  known  to  be  about  30. 

C  is  a  player  whose  class  is  known  to  be  about  20. 

D  is  a  player  whose  class  is  known  to  be  about  10. 

D  defeats  A,  6/2,6/2;  therefore  his  rate  is 40  minus  40  =    0 

D   defeats   C,   6/4,4/6,6/4;    therefore   his   rate   is. ..20  minus     5  =  15 

2)15 
Therefore  the  tournament  average  or  prime  rate  for  D  is 7.5 

The  above  figures  are  obtained  for  the  winner  (D  is  winner)  by  subtract- 
ing from  his  opponent's  approximate  class  (A  is  Class  40)  the  value  set  in 
the  rating  table  for  the  games  won  by  the  opponent  (A  won  four  games  in 
a  3-set  match,  for  which  the  rating  is  — 40),  hence  the  40  minus  40  =  0. 
For  the  loser  the  same  process  is  followed  except  that  the  figures  are  added 
instead  of  subtracted.) 

A  loses  to  D,  2/6,2/6;  therefore  A's  rate  is 10  plus  40  =  50 

C  defeats  B.   7/5.7/5;  therefore  his  rate  is 30  minus  10  =  20 

C  loses  to  D,   4/6,6/4,4/6;    therefore  his  rate  is 10  plus     5  =  15 

2)35 

Therefore  the  tournament  average  or  prime  rate  for  C  is....       17.5 
B  loses  to  C,   7/5,7/5;   therefore  B's  rate  is 20  plus  10  =  30 

PRIME  RATING. 

To  compute  a  player's  rating  for  the  season,  it  is  necessary  to  consider 
not  only  his  rating  in  any  given  tournament,  but  also  the  weight  of  the 
tournament  (see  Rule  5).  The  national  championship  has  a  weight  of  4, 
clay  court  3,  sectional  championships  2,  other  tournaments  1.  Now  if  a 
player  had  a  rate  of  30  in  the  national,  20  in  the  clay  court,  25  in  a  sec- 
tional, 10  in  one  other  tournament  and  15  in  another,  his  prime  rating 
would  be  obtained  by  averaging  his  rating  in  each  event,  multiphed  by  the 
weight  of  the  tournament,  as  follows: 

National   championship   rate 30  times  4   (weight)  =  120  or     30 

30 
30 
30 

Clay  court  championship  rate 20  times  3  (weight)  =    60  or     20 

20 
20 

Sectional   championship  rate 25  times  2  (weight)  =    50  or.    25 

Other    event    rate 10  times  1   (weight)  =    10  or    10 

Other    event    rate 15  times  1   (weight)  =    15  or    15 

11)255.00 
The  player's  prime  rating  for  the  season  is 23.18 

This  figure  generally  determines  the  player's  position  on  the  rankling  list. 
If  two  men  are  very  close,  their  records  may  be  re-figured,  using  the  prime 
rate  established  above,  instead  of  the  approximate  class,  and  the  result  thus 
obtained  will  be  the  final  rating. 

(13)  These  rules  may  be  amended  and  additions  thereto  may  be  made  by 
the  Executive  Committee  at  any  of  its  meetings.

deemed  necessary.

of  the  Lawn  Tennis  Association  or  Corresponding  Organization  of  the 
Champion  Nation,  so  that  it  shall  reach  him  not  later  than  the  first 
Monday  in  March  of  the  year,  in  which  the  Competition  is  to  take 
place.  Should  more  than  one  Nation  challenge,  they  shall  compete

notified  to  the  respective  Secretaries  for  the  time  being  of  the  Lawn 
Tennis  Associations  or  Corresponding  Organizations  of  the  several 
competing  Nations,  with  an  intimation  of  the  latest  date  by  which  the 
Tie  or  Ties  shall  be  concluded.  Failure  to  conclude  a  Tie  by  the  date 
fixed  by  the  Committee  of  Management  shall  render  both  Sides  liable 
to  be  scratched,  unless  in  the  opinion  of  the  Committee  of  Manage- 
ment, the  weather  or  other  unavoidable  hindrance,  shall  have  made 
completion  impossible.  Competing  Nations  shall  arrange  among  them- 
selves for  the  playing  of  their  respective  Ties  upon  a  ground  or  grounds, 
and  upon  a  date  or  dates  convenient  to  those  concerned  ;  but,  in  the 
event  of   an   agreement  not   being   arrived  at,    the   preliminary   Tie  or

belong  to  the  visiting  Nation  ;  or,  in  the  case  of  a  Tie  being  played  on 
neutral  ground,  one  third  each  to  the  visiting  Nations,  and  the  remain- 
ing fraction  of  profit  in  each  case  shall  go  to  the  Nation  in  whose 
Country  the   Tie   shall  be  played. 

8.  The  Challenge  Tie  shall  be  played  in  the  country  of  the  Champion 
Nation  at  a  date  and  upon  a  ground  to  be  agreed  upon  by  common

bona  fide  Amateur ;  but,  no  one  shall  be  entitled  to  play  for  more  than 
one  Nation  in  this  Competition  during  the  same  year.  During  the 
time  that  a  player  may  be  qualifying  tc»  play  for  a  Nation  under  the

to  decide,  or  which  may  be  referred  to  him  on  appeal  from  the  decision 
of  an  Umpire  by  the  players.  .He  shall  decide,  if  he  be  called  upon  to

Such  selection  by  the  Captain,  however,  shall  be  regarded  as  solely  for 
the  convenience  of  the  Executive  Committee,  and  may  be  varied  by 
him   before  the  commencement  of  play. 

(c)  For  the  Second  Round  of  the  Singles  Contest  in  any  Tie,  the 
Beferee  may  sanction  the  substitution  of  another  of  the  players  nom-

opinion,  of  the  Referee,  is  incapacitated  by  illness,  accident  or  other 
unavoidable  hindrance ;  provided  that  such  substitute  shall  not  be  the 
player  who  has  already  competed  in  the  Singles  Contest. 

13.  The  time  of  cessation  of  play  shall  be  fixed  before  the  com- 
mencement of  each  day's  play  by  the  Captains  of  the  opposing  Sides, 
or  by  the  Referee  if  they  shall  disagree.  It  shall  be  the  duty  of  the 
Referee  to  stop  play  when  this  time  arrives ;  provided,  nevertheless, 
that  he  may  extend  the  time  with  the  consent  of  the  Captains  of  the 
opposing  Sides.  A  player  shall  not  be  called  upon  to  pla.v  more  than

the  winner  of  a  Tie. 


15.  In  the  Singles,  each  Team  shall,  subject  to  Regulation  12. 
Clause  c,  consist  of  two  players,  who  shall  play  each  against  each  of

16.  Unless  otherwise  arranged  by  the  unanimous  consent  of  the  Cap- 
tains of  the  opposing  Sides  and  the  majority  of  the  Executive  Com- 
mittee, the  Doubles  shall  take  place  between  the  two  rounds  of  the 
Singles  Contest.  If,  however,  a  player  be  chosen  for  both  the  Singles 
and  Doubles  Contests,  and  if,  by  a  change  in  the  above  arrangements, 
he  be  called  upon  to  play  his  two  Singles  Matches  on  consecutive  days, 
then  there  shall  be  an  interval  of  one  day  between  the  second  and  the 
third  day's  play.  Provided,  nevertheless,  that  if  there  be  an  interval 
between  the  first  and  secon'd.  day's  play,  either  from  postponement, 
arrangement,  or  the  interval  of  a  Sunday,  there  shall  not  be  an  interval 
between  the  second  and  third  day's  play. 

17.  If  any  player  be  absent  when  called  upon  to  play  by  the  Referee, 
the  opposing  Side  shall  be  entitled  to  three  love  sets. 

18.  Any  Competing  Nation  whose  Lawn  Tennis  Association  or  Cor^ 
responding  Organization,  or  whose  Representatives  shall  fail  to  con- 
form to  the  above  Regulations,  may  be  disqualified  by  the  Committee 
of  Management  in  respect  of  the  Competition  for  the  year  wherein  sucb 
failure  shall  occur. 

19.  Winners  of  a  preliminary  Tie  shall  notify  the  result  without 
delay  to  the  Committee  of  Management,  by  telegram,  which  shall  be 
confirmed  by  letter. 

20.  For  purposes  of  correspondence  and  the  giving  of  notices  required 
by  these  Regulations,  the  Secretary  for  the  time  being  of  the  Lawn 
Tennis  Association  or  Corresponding  Organization  of  the  Champion 
Nation  shall  be  regarded  as  representing  the  Committee  of  Management. 

21.  The  above  Regulations  shall  be  binding  upon  the  Nations  con- 
cerned, and  shall  not  be  altered  except  with  the  consent  of  two-thirds 
of  the  Associations  or  Corresponding  Organizations  whose  Nations  shall 
have  from  time  to  time  competed  and  who  shall  record  their  votes. 

Note. — In  the  above  Regulations,  one  Nation  playing  against  another 
Is  regarded  as  a  "Tie"  ;  Singles  and  Doubles  are  regarded  as  separate 
"Contests"  ;  and  the  best  of  five  advantage  sets  is  regarded  as  a 
"Match".  The  players  in  Singles  and  Doubles  are  regarded  as  separate 
"Teams"  ;  and  the  players  in.  the  combined  Contests  as  a  "Side".

For  a  number  of  years  there  has  seemed  to  me 
to  be  a  great  need  for  an  explanation  of  the  Laws 
of  Lawn  Tennis  that  would  make  them  easily  under- 
stood by  all  who  play  or  follow  the  game  and  tend 
to  bring  about  a  uniform  application  of  the  rules. 

The  instructions  for  officials  and  players  naturally 
followed. 

A  compilation  of  this  kind  had  to  come  in  lawn 
tennis.  This  is  the  first  attempt — and  this  is  a  per- 
fecting age. 

Much  of  the  material  used  in  compiling  these 
explanations  and  instructions  has  been  taken  from 
American  Lawn  Tennis.  President  George  T.  Adee 
of  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Associa- 
tion, Raymond  D.  Little  and  Paul  B.  Williams  also 
have  been  of  great  assistance,  and  my  thanks  are  ex- 
tended to  them.

The  referee  shall,  during  the  tournament,  be  ex-officio  member  of  the  com- 
mittee. 

The  committee  shall  help  to  keep  order  on  the  ground,  and  shall  consult

have  power,  when  so  convened,  the  misconduct  of  a  competitor  having  been

ie  decision  of  an  umpire  shall  be  final  upon  every  question  of  fact,  and  no 
competitor  may  appeal  from  it;  but  if  an  umpire  be  in  doubt  as  to  a 
point  of  law,  or  if  a  competitor  appeal  against  his  decision  on  such  a 
point,  the  umpire  shall  submit  it  to  the  referee,  whose  decision  shall  be 
final. 

Note — A  question  of  fact  relates  to  events  that  actually  happened.  A 
question  of  law  is  the  construction  and  application  of  the  laws  of  the 
game  to  the  admitted  facts. 

The  umpire's  first  duty  upon  coming  to  the  court  is  to  measure  the  height 

the  net  at  the  center  and  at  the  posts  with  the  measuring  stick,  to  see  if 
is  in  accordance  with  the  rules.  The  net  should  fit  flush  to  the  net  posts. 
!  should  then  make  sure  that  all  his  linesmen's  and  umpires'  chairs  are  in 
isition,  and  that  his  own  chair  is  properly  placed — centered  to  the  net  post, 
d  about  five  feet  away  from  it.  The  net  also  should  be  looked  over  to  see 
at  it  is  perfect  and  that  there  are  no  holes  to  let  the  ball  through.  Atten- 
>n  to  all  these  details  goes  to  prevent  any  possible  delays  while  the  match  is 
ing  played,  for  such  delays  are  bad  for  the  contestants  and  are  not  enjoyed 

the  gallery. 
Where  a  full   corps  of  linesmen  cannot  be  obtained,   a  very   good  plan  to 
How  is  to  have  a  foot  fault  umpire  and  one  man  on  each  side  of  the  net,  on 
3  side  of  the  court  that  is  opposite  the  umpire's  chair.     With  this  arrange- 

nt  and  good  men,  no  match  will  suffer  so  far  as  decisions  go. 
The  seat  of  the  umpire's  chair  is  about  six  feet  from  the  ground,  with  a 
elf  about  two  feet  from  the  ground  placed  inside  the  four  supports  of  the 
air.  This  shelf  is  used  by  the  players  as  a  place  for  extra  rackets  or  any- 
ing  else  that  they  may  want,  such  as  rosin,  extra  shoelaces,  sawdust  (to  dry 
eir  racket  hands),  adhesive  tape,  whatever  they  may  want  to  drink,  lemons 
Ived  to  cleanse  their  mouths,  and  plenty  of  towels.  An  extra  supply  of  balls 
io  should  be  kept  there.     Under  the  chair  and  on  the  ground  there  should 

two  buckets  of  ice  water  for  the  players  to  bathe  their  faces  and  heads  if 
is  necessary. 
Seventeen  chairs  for  doubles,  thirteen  for  singles — a  folding  wooden  chair  is 

best — are  placed  in  their  proper  stations,  care  being  given  to  see  that  they 
;  a  sufficient  distance  from  the  lines  to  be  well  out  of  the  players'  way.   One 

these  chairs  is  for  the  net  umpire,  two  are  for  the  foot  fault  judges,  and 

remainder  for  the  linesmen,  of  whom  there  are  ten  for  a  singles  match  and 
jrteen  for  doubles.     Another  chair  is  placed  alongside  of  the  umpire's  stand, 
be  occupied  by  an  assistant  scorer,  who  acts  as  a  checker  should  the  umpire 
come  confused  in  his  scoring. 
Near  the  court,  in  a  position  of  advantage,  is  placed  still  another  chair  for 

referee  of  the  tournament,  so  that  he  may  see  the  play  and  be  immediately 
ailable  in  case  the  players  should  appeal  to  him  from  the  umpire's  decision, 

should  he  be  called  upon  for  any  of  the  decisions  that  the  rules  make  it  his 
ity  to  give.  All  these  chairs  should  be  painted  a  dark  green  and  numbered. 
It  is  most  important  for  the  proper  conduct  of  a  match  that,  with  the  excep- 
•n  of  the  players,  the  ball  boys  and  the  officials  named  above,  no  other 
rson  should  be  permitted  inside  the  enclosure.  This  is  strictly  enforced. 
An  umpire  and  linesmen's  card  is  handed  to  each  official  as  he  is  selected;

position  he  is  to  fill,  the  competitors,  number  of  the  court  and  the  time  he  ii 
to  be  at  his  station. 

While  the  players  are  warming  up,  the  umpire  should  give  one  last  lool 
around  to  see  that  all  his  linesmen  and  umpires  are  at  their  stations  and  tha 
everything  else  is  in  readiness.  Then  he  should  climb  into  his  chair.  Aftei 
giving  the  players  a  reasonable  length  of  time  to  warm  up,  he  should  ask  then 
if  they,  are  ready.     Upon  receiving  an  affirmative  reply,  he  should  call: 

"Linesmen  ready?     Players  ready?" 

If  they  are,  then  follows  the  call,  "Play!" — and  the  match  is  on. 

Just  before  the  player  first  serving  gets  into  position,  the  umpire  shoul< 
announce: 

"Mr.  So-and-So  serving." 

Each  player,  as  he  serves  for  the  first  time,  should  be  similarly  announced. 

The  umpire  always  should  remember  that  he  is  a  sort  of  connecting  lin; 
between  the  match  and  the  gallery. 

He  should  announce  his  decisions  and  the  score  promptly  and  decisively  ani 
in  a  good  loud  voice,  so  that  all  can  hear. 

He  should  be  careful  not  to  speak  wjiile  the  gallery  is  applauding,  but  shoul 
wait  until  the  applause  is  finished. 

He  should  also — this  is  an  especially  important  point — be  most  careful  nc 
to  call  the  score  while  a  player  is  serving,  or  while  the  ball  is  in  play. 

The  umpire  should  instantly  repeat  the  decision  of  the  linesmen  and  foe 
fault  umpire.  This  is  by  far  the  best  method  to  follow,  as  it  is  next  to  impoi 
sible  to  obtain  a  full  corps  of  officials,  all  of  whom  will  announce  thei 
decisions  loudly  enough  for  everyone  to  hear. 

The  umpire  should  always  keep  tally  on  a  score  card.  It  is  dangerous  1 
try  to  keep  it  in  your  head.  Cards  for  this  purpose  can  be  had  for  a  vei 
small  amount  of  money.  There  are  so  many  methods  of  keeping  score  that 
most  interesting  article  could  be  written  on  this  subject.  For  the  present  it 
enough  to  suggest  that  you  should  adopt  whatever  method  you  find  most  sui 
able  to  your  use. 

Where  the  galleries  are  large,  it  is  a  good  plan  to  instruct  each  linesma 
as  he  calls  "out"  or  "fault,"  to  signify  his  decision  with  a  motion  of  his  an 
Frequently  the  applause  is  so  great  that  the  linesman's  voice  cannot  be  heai 
by  the  umpire.    • 

Where  the  player  obstructs  the  linesman's  view  of  the  ball  or  line,  the  latt 
should  immediately  call,  "Cannot  see  it";  the  umpire  then  makes  the  decisi( 
or  orders  the  point  played  over  again  as  the  laws  specify. 

Good  ball  boys  are  a  great  help  to  an  umpire  and  a  joy  to  the  players.  Th> 
can  be  made  proficient  only  by  careful  training  under  a  competent  instructc 

At  a  match,  the  umpire  must  watch  the  court  and  see  that  it  is  kept  clear  ■ 
balls.  Whenever  he  sees  a  ball  that  has  been  overlooked  by  a  boy,  he  shou 
quickly  call  attention  to  it.  The  ball  boy  must  never  go  on  a  court  while  t 
ball  is  in  play. 

It  is  the  duty  of  the  umpire  to  note  the  time  that  the  players  leave  the  coi 
for  their  "rest  period."  He  should  go  off  the  court  with  them,  and  keep  th< 
posted  as  to  how  much  of  their  seven  minutes  has  elapsed.  He  must  see  th 
they  are  back  on  the  court  within  the  seven  minutes  allowed  by  t!ie  rules.

n  a  match  where  there  is  just  an  umpire  and  no  other  officials,  it  should  be 

jnged  with  the  players  that  should  they  obstruct  th.e  umpire's  view  of  the 

I  he  shall  say,  "Call  it,"  and  the  ball  shall  be  played  on  their  decision. 

)nce  a  decision  is  made  on  a  stroke,  the  point  should  not  be  played  over 

ess  the  rules  so  provide.    This  must  be  lived  up  to.

Ise  decisions.

Mo  omission  on  the  part  of  the  umpire  of  any  of  the  duties  that  the  Laws

fignate  to  him  shall  of  itself  invalidate  any  stroke,  game  or  match. 
He  shall  not  bet  on  a  match  to  which  he  is  assigned. 

One  of  the  most  important  qualifications  of  umpires  and  linesmen  is  a  good 
id  voice  and  a  willingness  to  use  it.    Do  not  be  afraid  to  speak  up. 
Under  no  circumstances  can  a  player  over-rule  the  decision  of  a  linesman. 
No  self-respecting  umpire  or  linesman  will  submit  to  having  his   decisions

Do  not  be  thin-skinned.     Make  your  decision  as  you  see  the  ball  played,  and

DUTIES  OF  THE  LINESMAN. 

He  is  appointed  by  the  referee  or  such   other  member  or  members  of  the 
iirnament  committee  as  may  be  selected  for  that  purpose. 
He  shall  call  faults  and  decide  strokes  relating  to  the  line  or  lines  to  which 
is  assigned  and  to  said  line  or  lines  only,  and  such  decision  shall  be  final. 
He  must  keep  his  eye  on  the  ball  all  the  time  it  is  in  play.     "Eyes  on  the 
ill,  and  nowhere  else,"  should  be  his  slogan. 

If  he  is  asked  by  the  umpire  whether  a  ball  is  good,  his  answer  must  be 
ompt  and  decisive. 

He  should  sit  quietly  at  his  station,  and  remain  as  motionless  as  possible,  as 
ly  movement  annoys  the  players. 

One  of  the  greatest  benefits  to  players,  umpires  and  spectators  is  for  lines* 
en  to  give  their  decisions  in  a  voice  that  all  can  hear. 

The  linesman  has  only  one  decision  to  make,  and   that  is   either  "out"  or 
ault."     He  can  hardly  make  his  announcement  too  loud. 
He  must  never  call  "Good"  unless  asked  for  a  decision   by  the  player  or 
mpire. 

Where  the  galleries  are  large,  it  is  a  good  plan  for  the  linesman  to  signify 
is  decision  of  "Out"  with  a  motion  of  his  arm  made  in  the  direction  that  the 
all  strikes  out  of  court.  Frequently  the  applause  is  so  great  that  the  lines- 
jian's  voice  cannot  be  heard  by  tl'P  umpire. 

'  Do   not  talk   to   a   spectator;    talking   may   distract   your   attention   from   the 
tiatch  and  cause  you  to  n.dke  a  bad  decision  by  losing  sight  cf  the  ball.

The  linesman  on  the  center  service  line  should  be  the  judge  as  to  wheth

He  must  not  converse  with  the  base  linesmen. 

He  must  make  his  decision  in  a  voice  that  all  can  hear.

matches  it  is  next  to  impossible  to  have  a  full  corps  of  foot  fault  judges,  it  i 
a  wise  plan  to  have  four  or  five  good  men  roaming  around  the  courts,  to  watcl 
the  players  and  call  foot  faults  where  necessary. 

Foot  fault  judges  should  remember  that  a  foot  fault  only  can  be  callei 
where  they  are  positive  that  the  rule  has  been  broken.  The  player  mus

Lawn  Tennis  Etiquette 

By  Edward  C.  Conlin,  Chairman  National  Umpires'  Association. 

(CosyiiEht.  1313.  by  American  Shorts  Fublislilns  Company.) 

The  most  notable  asset  of  lawn  tennis  is  the  high  standard  of  sportsmanship 
developed  by  its  players  and  followers  through  so  many  years  that  it  has 
become  the  tradition  of  the  game.  This  tradition  is  in  your  keeping,  for  the 
sport's  reputation  is  made — or  marred — by  everyone  playing  it.  Therefore  you 
should  cherish  this  tradition  above  all  else,  as  a  legacy  from  past  generations 
to  be  handed  down  unimpaired  to  those  who  follow  you. 

With  this  in  mind  you  can  realize  the  significance  of  the  statement  that 
tennis  is  a  sportsman's  game — played  for  the  sake  of  the  sport.  So  you  should 
acquire  the  "sporting"  habit  of  mind.  Know  the  rules,  and  obsei've  them  in 
every  particular.  Always  give  your  opponent  the  benefit  of  the  doubt  and,  at 
the  same  time.  Play  hard,  play  fair,  and  play  to  win!  Thus  you  will  help  to 
maintain  the  traditional  place  of  honor  for  tennis  in  the  realm  of  sport  and 
will  be  of  the  greatest  assistance  to  those  who  are  giving  their  best  effort  to 
increase  the  prestige  and  popularity  of  the  game. 

Always  look  neat  and  clean  on  the  court.  Wear  the  clothes  of  a  gentleman 
and  have  them  clean,  particularly  so  in  a  match.  Every  champion  of  the  game 
has  lived  up  to  this,  and  it  will  not  hurt  your  game  to  do  so. 

"Stalling"  is  not  a  nice  word — keep  it  out  of  the  game.  You,  the  player, 
can  do  it;  for  the  umpire  to  do  so  is  a  most  difficult  task.  The  player  knows 
he  is  "stalling"  before  his  opponent  or  the  umpire  does;  it  is  up  to  you  to  be 
a  sportsman,  game  and  true. 

BEFORE  THE  TOURNAMENT. 

Help  in  every  way  possible  to  make  the  work  of  the  committee  easier,  for 
theirs  is  a  hard  job,  at  the  best. 

Send  your  entry  to  the  person  mentioned  in  the  notice  as  the  proper 
recipient.     Do  not  give  it  to  someone  else  who  is  apt  to  forget  about  it. 

Enter  only  those  events  you  expect  to  play  in. 

If  you  want  to  play  in  the  doubles,  secure  a  partner  before  you  send  in 
your  entry.     Do  not  trust  to  pick  one  up  when  you  reach  the  grounds. 

Put  your  address  and  telephone  numbers  and  that  of  your  doubles  partner, 
also  the  name  of  the  club  that  you  belong  to,  on  your  entry. 

Send  your  entry  fee  in  with  your  entry.  Do  not  make  the  committee  mem- 
ber ask  you  for  it.    Pay  for  all  the  events  you  expect  to  play  in. 

AT  THE  TOURNAMENT. 

Bear  in  mind  that  the  tournament  comes  before  your  individual  preference. 

Be  at  the  courts  promptly  at  the  time  the  tournament  notice  states  that  play 
will  start. 

Report  to  the  man  in  charge  of  the  scoreboard  just  as  soon  as  you  reach 
the  grounds,  and  when  you  do,  tell  him  your  name  and  your  partner's,  if  you 
are  playing  in  doubles. 

Do  not  ask  the  committee  every  few  minutes  if  your  opponent  has  arrived. 

Do  not  ask  the  referee  to  excuse  you  for  a  day,  for  by  so  doing  you  are 
apt  to  tie  up  a  whole  bracket.     It  gives  him  no  pleasure  to  default  you. 

Do  not  tell  the  committee  how  to  run  the  tournament— just  play  in  it,  that's 
your  job. 

The  committee  works  for  the  good  of  all — they  have  no  grudge  against  you. 


236  SPAUJING'S    LA^TN    TENNIS    ABTNUAL. 

Wken  you  go  out  to  play  a  match,  try  to  take  everything  with  you  that  yoH 
think  you  will  need.    It  is  better  for  yourself,  your  opponent  and  the  match. 

Accept  and  play  on  the  umpire's  or  linesmen's  decision  whether  it  is  fer 
or  against  you,  for  bad  calls  in  a  match  will  even  up,  and  you  must  respscl 
the  official's  decision  or  ask  to  have  him  replaced. 

Be  back  on  your  court  promptly  after  the  seven  minutes'  rest.  Do  not  make 
your  opponent  wait  for  you — play  fairly  to  the  rule  on  this  point. 

Thank  the  umpire  when  your  match  is  finished.  It  is  a  courtesy  that  is 
appreciated   by  the  official. 

Read  and  know  the  rules,  then  play  right  up  to  the  letter  of  them. 

IN  GENERAL. 

"Thank  you"  is  an  appeal,  not  an  acknowledgment.  Comply  by  returning 
the  stray  ball  quickly  and  good-naturedly. 

When  returning  the  balls  between  strokes  to  the  server,  look  first  to  see 
where  he  is  standing,  and  return  the  ball  as  near  to  that  part  of  the  court  a» 
possible.    Roll  them  along  the  ground  and  under  the  net  if  you  can. 

If  you  touch  the  net  while  the  ball  is  in  play  or  commit  any  other  infraction 
of  the  rules  that  loses  the  point  for  you,  instantly  announce  the  fact  of  your 
doing  so. 

Do  not  leave  it  to  your  opponent  to  keep  the  point  or  game  score.  It  is 
your  job  as  much  as  his,  and  it  makes  the  game  run  smoother  and  faster. 

Do  not  call  a  ball  that  you  have  hit  "in"  or  "out."  That  is  for  your  oppo- 
nent to  do. 

Do  not  serve  until  your  opponent  seems  to  be  ready;  a  glance  at  him  will 
tell  whether  he  is  or  not.     It  is  not  fair  to  hurry  your  service. 

When  a  service  is  a  fault,  let  it  go  by  you  and  do  not  hit  it,  as  it  is  very 
apt  to  annoy  the  server  as  he  is  delivering  the  second  ball. 

Your  opponent  will  call  the  balls  on  his  side  of  the  court,  no  matter  what 
you  think.  Play  on  his  call;  the  breaks  will  even  up  during  a  match.  There 
are  very  few  plavers  who  will  knowingly  call  them  wrong. 

Read,  study  and  know  the  rules. 

ETIQUETTE  FOR  THE  GALLERY 

When  you  are  a  spectator  at  a  tennis  match,  you  are  one  of  the  "gallery" 
which  has  assembled  to  see  good  tennis  played.  There  are  well  defined 
(although  unwritten)  laws  of  conduct  for  the  gallery,  which  are  as  binding 
upon  them  as  the  laws  of  tennis  are  upon  the  players  and  officials.  Only  by 
your  co-operation  in  observing  these  unwritten  laws  can  the  perfect  playing 
conditions  be  secured  which  make  for  the  successful  conduct  of  a  tournament 
and  your  enjoyment  of  the  matches  you  witness. 

A  tennis  ball  in  play  moves  very  fast,  and  other  moving  objects  in  his  range 
of  vision  distract  a  player  by  making  it  hard  for  him  to  follow  the  ball's  line 
of  flight.  Therefore,  the  ladies  particularly,  should  be  careful  to  keep  parasols 
and  fans  in  the  background. 

A  gallery  goes  to  a  match  to  see  good  tennis  played. 

The  committee  strives  to  make  the  gallery  comfortable  and  give  to  the  con- 
testants playing  conditions  as  perfect  as  possible. 

The  committee's  task  of  satisfying  the  players  and  pleasing  the  gallery  is  a 
hard  one  at  best,  and  any  co-operation  that  both  can  accord  should  be  freely 
given.     It  is  with  this  in  mind  that  the  following  suggestions  are  made: 


SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL.  257 

A  moTing  background  is  the  most  disturbing  condition  that  a  player  can 
experience;  it  makes  perfect  play  of  the  ball  next  to  impossible.  For  this 
reason  you  should  not  move  about  when  opposite  the  end  of  a  court,  except 
when  it  is  absolutely  necessary  to  do  so. 

If  you  are  in  a  stand  that  faces  more  than  one  court,  do  not  move  from  one 
match  to  the  other  while  the  play  is  on;  it  is  fatal  to  good  play.  If  you  want 
to  watch  the  other  match,  wait  until  a  set  is  finished  before  moving. 

Do  not  applaud  or  give  vocal  expression  of  your  feelings  while  a  rally  is  on, 
but  wait  until  the  point  has  been  played  out  and  then  applaud  all  you  want  to. 

Do  not  applaud  errors;  by  that  is  meant  that  your  approval  should  be  given 
to  good  strokes  only.  Do  not  applaud  a  shot  that  goes  out  of  court  or  into 
the  net,  even  if  it  gives  a  point  to  the  player  you  want  to  win.  ^^ 

Do  not  coach  the  players.  Never  call  "Good,"  "Out,"  "Let  it  go,"  "Hit 
tt,"  etc.,  because  thereby  you  are  influencing  a  player's  judgment,  which  is  a 
factor  in  the  outcome  of  the  match.  Furthermore,  coaching  interferes  with 
the  fair  playing  of  a  match  and  may  become  extremely  disconcerting  by  caus- 
ing doubt  as  to  whether  some  particular  call  came  from  a  spectator  or  was 
an  official's  decision. 

Never  talk  to  an  umpire,  linesman  or  player  while  a  match  is  in  progress. 

If  you  do  not  agree  with  the  decisions  as  they  are  given,  withhold  your 
disapproval;  remember  that  the  linesmen  and  umpires  are  in  a  better  position 
to  judge  the  play  than  you  are  and  that  the  committee  has  selected  the  most 
competent  men  available  for  these  duties. 

Do  not  throw  a  stray  ball  into  the  court  while  play  is  on;  wait  until  a 
stroke  is  finished  and  then  roll  it  in. 

Refrain  from  talking  loudly  while  a  match  is  on,  as  a  player  hears  you  and 
frequently  takes  it  as  a  call  from  a  linesman  and  does  not  play  a  good  ball. 

Under  no  circumstances  walk  or  stand  so  near  a  court  that  you  obstruct  a 
contestant;  this  is  inexcusable. 

Do  not  walk  or  stand  on  the  playing  surface  of  a  court  before  or  after  a 
match,  as  the  heels  of  your  shoes  make  holes  in  the  surface  that  cause  the 
ball  to  take  bad  bounds  when  a  match  is  played. 

Just  before  a  match,  do  not  try  to  renew  an  old  acquaintanceship  or  express 
your  wishes  for  victory  to  a  player.  Leave  him  alone;  he  has  enough  on  his 
mind  at  that  time.  See  him  after  the  match;  he  has  more  time  then  and  you 
will  find  him  more  cordial. 

If  you  have  to  bring  a  dog  with  you,  see  that  he  watches  the  match  from 
the  side  lines.     AU  players  are  fond  of  dogs— after  the  match. 

Know  your  neighbors  at  a  tennis  match  before  '^ou  criticize  a  player — 
friends  and  relatives  frequently  attend. 

The  request,  "Please  do  not  smoke,"  is  made  by  the  committee  in  their 
endeavor  to  get  you  to  help  them  obey  the  laws  of  the  Fire  Department  that 
generally  apply  to  stands  built  of  wood. 

Bear  in  mind  that  tennis  is  an  amateur  sport,  played  for  its  own  sake  and 
not  for  profit.  Most  tournaments  are  run  at  a  loss.  Neither  the  players  noi 
officials  receive  a  cent  for  their  services.  The  matches  give  pleasure  to  the 
spectators  and  players  and  your  attitude  toward  these  contests  should  always 
be  governed  by  this  consideration. 

Read  and  knowihe  rules;    it  will   add  to  your  enjoyment  of  the  matches 

And  last,  do  what  you  can  to  help  the  committee,  for  they  are  working  foi 
your  pleasure.

mittee and  of  the  Referee. 

4.  No  cheques,  orders  for  money  or  cash  payments  in  any  form

from  the  decision  of  an  TJmpire.  and  such  decision  shall  be  final. 

7.  The  Referee  shall,  during  the  Tournament,  be  ex-officio  a  mem- 
ber of  the  Committee. 

8.  The  Committee  shall  help  to  keep  order  on  the  ground,  and

tion, if  summoned  for  that  purpose  by  the  Referee  or  by  any  two  of

misconduct  of  a  competitor  having  been  reported  to  them  by  a  mem- 
ber of  the  Committee  or  an  Umpire,  to  disqualify  the  offender,  and 
further  to  order  him  off  the  ground,  should  his  misconduct  appear  to 
them  to  justify  such  action,  but  before  such  action  shall  be  taken,  an 
opportunity  of  offering  an  explanation  shall  be  afforded  to  the  com- 
petitor whose  misconduct  has  been  reported  to  them.  When  the  whole 
of  the  Committee  of  a  Club  or  even  a  quorum  thereof  may  not  be 
available,  the  members  of  the  Committee  that  are  available  shall  have 
power  to  act  in  cases  left  to  the  Committee  of  the  Club. 

p.     It  is  the  duty  of  an  Umpire^ 

(a)  To  ascertain  that  the  net  is  at  the  right  height  before  the 
commencement  of  play,  and  to  measure  and  adjust  the  net  during 
play,  if  asked  to  do  so,  or  if,  in  his  opinion,  its  height  has  altered. 

(b)  To  call  the  faults  (subject  to  Regulation  10)  and  lets  unless 
he  delegates   such  power. 

(c)  To  call  the  strokes  when  won,  or  when  he  is  asked  to  call 
them,   and  to  record  them  upon   the  Umpire's  scoring  sheet.      (See 

[    example  at  bottom  of  following  page.) 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


269 


(d)  To  call  the  games  and  the  sets  at  the  end  of  each,  or  when 
asked  to  call  them,  and  to  record  them  on  the  Umpire's  scoring 
sheet. 

NOTE — At  the  end  of  each  game  the  games  should  be  called  with  the 
name  of  the  player  who  is  in  advance,  thus:  "2  games  to  1,  B  wins"  or, 
"B  leads."  If  the  games  are  level  the  score  should  be  failed  thus,  "three 
games  all,"  or  as  the  case  may  be.  At  the  end  of  each  set  the  sets  should 
be  called  in  like  manner. 

(e)  To  direct  the  Competitors  to  change  sidas,  in  accordance  with 
Law  24. 

(f)  When  appealed  to  during  a  rally,  whether  a  doubtful  ball  is 
"in  play"  ci*  not,  to  call  "play,"  and  at  the  conclusion  of  the  rally 
to  give  his  decision  (subject  to  Regulation  11)  or  direct  the  com- 
petitors to  play  the  stroke  again. 

(g)  To  decide  all  doubtful  or  disputed  strokes,  and  all  points  of 
law  (subject  to  Regulations  10  and  11),  and  to  be  responsible  for 
the    proper    conduct    of    the    match. 

(h)  In  handicap  matches  to  call  the  odds  at  the  commencement 
of  each  set. 

(i)  To  sign  the  Umpire's  scoring  sheets,  and  to  deliver  rthem  at 
the  conclusion  of  the  match  to  such  person  as  the  Committee  may 
authorize  to  receive  them. 

Provided,  that  no  omission  of  any  of  the  foregoing  duties  on  the 
part  of  an  Umpire  shall  of  itself  invalidate  any  stroke,  game  or  match. 

10.  It  is  the  duty  of  the  Linesman  to  call  faults  and  to  decide 
strokes  relating  to  the  line  or  lines  to  which  he  is  assigned  and  to 
said  line  or  lines  only,  find  such  decision  shall  be  final.  Should  the 
Linesman  be  unable  to  give  a  decision,  the  Umpire  shall  decide  or 
shall  direct  the  stroke  to  be  played  again. 

11.  T'he  decision  of  an  Umpire  shall  be  final  upon  every  question 
of  fact,  and  no  competitor  may  appeal  from  it ;  but  if  an  Umpire  be 
in  doubt  as  to  a  point  of  law,  or  if  a  competitor  appeal  against  his 
decision  on  such  a  point,  the  Umpire  shall  submit  it  to  the  Referee 
whose  decision  shall  be  final. 

NOTE — A  question  of  fact  relates  to  events  that  actually  happened.  A 
question  of  law  is  the  construction  and  application  of  the  laws  of  the  game 
to   the  admitted  facts. 


Example: 

The   strokes   are   scored   by   means   of   pencil  marks  in  the   spaces  beneath 
the  word   "STROKES,"    thus:

(A.B.)"  In  the  second  game:  "Love — 15,  15  all,  15 — 30,  30  all,  40 — 30,

Ana  30  on  with  larger  numbers  in  the  same  manner. 

18.  If  a  Competitor  be  absent  when  called  upon  to  play,  or  ahall 
refuse  to  play,  or  shall  have  given  previous  notice  to  the  Keferee  or  to 
a  member  of  the  Committee  that  he  cannot  play  in  the  next  round,  his 
adversary  shall  win  in  that  round,  unless  said  Competitor  shall  have 
been  formally  excused  for  a  definite  period  by  the  Referee. 

Case  1 — K  notifies  the  Committee  that  he  is  unable  to  be  present 
on  the  day  his  match  is  scheduled.  Does  this  constitute  a  valid 
reason  for  postponement  or  should  he  be  defaulted? 

Decision — Unless  he  is  excused  for  that  day  by  the  Referee,  he 

must  be  defaulted. — R.  D.  Wrenn. 

Case  2 — In  a  handicap  tennis  tournament,  one  round  of  which  is 
to  be  played  off  each  week,  two  opponents  fail  to  play,  through 
no  fault  of  either.  Should  both  be  defaulted?  Has  the  Com- 
mittee a  right  to  toss  a  coin  and  default  the  loser  of  the  toss 
■without  the  assent  of  the  players? 

Decision — When  you  say,  "Two  opponents  fail  to  play,  through 
no  fault  of  their  own,"  I  do  not  know  exactly  what  you  mean. 
The  usual  course  In  any  Tournament  is  for  the  Committee  to 
•  state  the  time  at  which  a  match  is  to  be  played,  and  in  case 
one  of  the  players  does  not  appear,  it  is  perfectly  proper  for 
the  Committee  to  default  the  absentee.  If  neither  player 
is  present  when  called  upon  to  play,  the  Committee  could 
default  both  players. 

I  should  call  it  a  very  imusual  and  certainly  not  a  wise  proceed- 
ing for  a  Tournament  Committee  to  toss  a  coin  and  default 
the  loser  of  the  toss  without  the  assent  of  the  players. 

— R.  D.  Wrenn. 
A  player  or  doubles  team  cannot  be  compelled  to  play  on  a 
Sunday. 

19.  In  handicap  matches  the  competitors  shall  he  handicapped  by 
the  Committee,  or  by  a  Handicapper  appointed  by  the  Committee. 

20.  The  method  of  handicapping  shall  be  by  classes  as  follows:

ber  of  the  class  of  the  inferior  player.  The  odds  specified  at  the  In 
tersection  of  the  two  columns  are  the  odds  required. 

Example. — If  class  3  has  to  meet  class  0,  start  from  the  figure  3 
in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures,  and  look  horizontally  until  the  vertical 
column  is  reached  headed  by  the  figure  0.  The  odds  given  at  the  point 
of  intersection  of  the  two  columns  (viz.  15  and  1-6  of  15)  are  the 
odds  required. 

When  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the  worst  players  en- 
tered is  great  (say  more  than  30).  it  is  desirable  to  handicap  the 
best  players  at  owed  odds.  The  players  above  scratch  (i.  e.,  owing 
odds)    should  be  classified  as  follows  : 

OWED   ODDS.

8 15  and  2-sixths  of  15  17 30  and  5-slxths  of  15 

9 15  and  3-sixths  of  15  18 4i0i 

When  *he  two  players  in  different  classes  above  scratch  meet,  the 
Inferior  player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  owed  by  the 
superior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table,  No.  2. 

This  table  is  to  be  used  in  the  same  way  as  the  former,  the  class 
of  the  superior  player  being  looked  for  in  the  horizontal  line  of  fig- 
ures at  the  top,  and  the  class  of  the  inferior  player  in  the  diagonal 
line  of  figures. 

Example. — If  class  12  (owe  30)  meet  class  7  (owe  15  and  1-6  of 
15),  the  former  must  owe  the  latter  the  odds  of  4-6  of  15. 

21.  In  Championship  matches  and  handicaps  by  classes,  as  above, 
advantage  sets  shall  be  played  throughout. 

22.  The  Committee  may,  whether  appealed  to  by  any  competitor 
or  not,  postpone  the  meeting  or  any  match  or  part  of  a  match  if,  in 
their  opinion,  the  state  of  the  weather,  or  of  the  light,  or  the  condi- 
tion of  the  ground,  or  other  circumstances,  render  it  advisable  to  do 
so.    In  cases  of  postponement,  Law  25  must  be  strictly  observed. 

23.  In  all  tournaments  sanctioned  by  the  Association  the  use  of 
spikes  longer  than  one-quarter  of  an  inch  is  prohibited. 

24.  Every  organization  holding  an  event  sanctioned  by  the  United 
States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association  must  furnish  the  Ranking 
Committee,  within  ten  days  after  the  completion  of  any  such  event, 
with  a  full  and  complete  report  of  all  matches  played  therein,  together 
with  the  full  name  and,  when  possible,  address  of  each  contestant. 

25.  The  Ranking  Committee  must  furnish  all  Clubs  and  Associa- 
tions holding  any  such  sanctioned  event  with  blanks  for  the  purpose 
of  making  the  returns  required  bv  Regulation  24.  and  immediately  after 
the  Committee  shall  have  completed  the  ranking,  such  returns  must 
be  delivered  to  the  Secretary  of  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis 
Association. 

26.  If  any  Club  or  Association  fails  to  make  the  returns  required, 
provided  for  bv  Regulation  24.  sanction  for  holding  by  the  delinquent 
of  any  tournament  during  the  following  year  may  be  refused  In  the 
discretion  of  the  Executive  Committee.

earn  the  owed  strokes  before  he  begins  to  score,  while,  in  the  case  of 
given  odds,  the  poorer  player  is  given  his  handicap  before  play  starts, 
niese  owed  odds  may  be  used  either  in  conjunction  with  the  given  odds 
or  separately.  In  order  that  the  handicaps  may  occur  as  seldom  as 
possible  in  the  same  games,  when  two  players  meet,  one  of  whom  owes 
odds  and  the  other  receives  them,  the  games  on  which  owed  strokes 
are  paid  differ  from  those  on  which  the  given  strokes  are  taken. 
Here  is  the  table  for  owed  odds  : 

One-sixth  (1-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  seventh,  thirteenth 
and  every  subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  seventh, 
ninth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Three-sixths  (3-6  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third, 
fifth  and  every  other  alternate  game  in  each  set. 

Four-sixths  (4-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fifth,  sixth 
and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Five-sixths  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fourth,  fifth, 
sixth  and  corresponding  games   in   each   set. 

Fifteen   (15)   is  one  stroke  owed  on  each  game. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (15.1),  fifteen  and  two-sixths  (15.2),  fifteen 
and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty),  fifteen  and  four-sixths  (15.4), 
fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5),  thirty  (30),  thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.1), 
thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2),  thirty  and  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half- 
forty),  thirty  and  four-sixths  (30.4).  thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and 
forty  <!40),  correspond  to  the  fractions  of  fifteen,  as  do  the  larger 
handicaps  in  the  table  for  given  odds  correspond  to  the  fractions  of 
fifteen  in  that  table. 

The  simplest  method  for  handicappers  to  pursue  is  to  sort  out  the 
entries  for  the  event   they   are   to   handicap    into   classes  according  to 


270  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

the  relative  skill  of  the  players.  Then  select  the  class  with  the  great- 
est number  of  players  in  it  and  place  them  on  scratch,  handicapping 
all  of  the  other  players  either  behind  or  in  advance  of  scratch  by 
owed  or  given  odds,  so  as  to  make  all  even  at  the  odds. 

In  deciding  upon  each  player's  handicap,  his  ability  as  compared 
with  the  scratch  men  should  tirst  be  considered,  and  then  as  compared 
with  his  nearest  and  furthest  rivals  in  the  tables  of  odds.  Each 
player  might  meet  any  of  the  others,  and  the  object  of  handicapping 
Js  to  give  him  an  exactly  even  chance,  no  matter  whom  his  opponent 
•may   be. 

It  should  be  remembered  that  it  is  easier  to  owe  15,  or  any  fraction 
of  it,  than  it  is  to  give  it,  and  when  odds  of  30  are  given,  the  poorer 
player's  score  has  already  reached  pretty  near  the  end  of  the  game, 
and  the  difference  between  him  and  the  best  men  must  be  very  great 
to  give  the  latter  an  even  chance,  should  they  meet. 

It  is  very  unwise  to  give  even  the  poorer  players  over  30.3  (half- 
forty),  and  very  seldom  is  it  safe  to  make  the  given  odds  run  higher 
than  30.  If  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the  poorest  players 
is  very  great,  place  the  latter  as  far  as  necessary  behind  scratch,  but 
do  not  advance  the  former  to  more  than  30,  or  30.3  in  the  most  ex- 
treme cases.  

HOW  TO  CONDUCT  A  TOURNAMENT. 

A  tournament  committee  should  first  of  all  be  selected,  with  not 
less  than  five  men,  and  as  many  as  possible  practical  workers  who 
have  the  time  and  inclination  to  closely  look  after  the  interests  of  the 
club.  At  its  first  meeting,  the  committee  should  decide  upon  all  de- 
tails of  the  meeting.  In  selecting  a  date,  it  is  advisable  to  choose 
one  immediately  before  or  after  some  establisbed  tournament  in  the 
neighborhood,  for  then  the  entries  of  those  who  are  to  play  In  the 
other  event  can  generally  be  secured. 

Application  should  be  made  to  the  national  governing  body  for 
official  sanction  for  the  tournament,  stating  dates  and  other  particu- 
lars. If  any  championship  events  are  to  be  on  the  programme,  official 
recognition  must  be  applied  for  before  these  titles  can  5e  of  any  value. 

A  printed  circular  should  be  issued  by  the  tournament  committee, 
which  should  state  plainly — (1)  the  name  of  the  club  and  the  loca- 
tion of  the  courts ;  (2)  the  date  of  the  meeting  and  the  hours  of  play  ; 
(3)  the  list  of  events,  and  the  championship  titles  (if  any)  to  be 
competed  for,  with  the  prizes  offered  for  each  event:  (4)  the  amount 
of  the  entrance  fees,  and  place  and  date  for  closing  the  list  of  entries ; 

(5)  the  name  of  referee,  handicapper  and  tournament  committee  ;  and 

(6)  the  time  and  place  of  the  draw. 

The  draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  committee  in  public  and 
due  notice  of  the  time  and  place  be  given  to  the  competitors,  so  that 
they  may  be  'present  or  represented  when  the  draw  is  made.  The 
draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  Bagnall-Wilde  system.  (See 
"Tournament  Regulations.") 

No  money  or  its  equivalent  in  any  form  should  be  offered  as  prizes, 
for  this  would  disqualify  the  players  from  future  competition  as  ama- 
teurs. Prizes  should  be  silver,  gold,  cut  glass,  objects  of  art  or  other 
souvenirs  of  this  kind  that  can  be  marked  or  engraved  as  trophies. 
It  is  preferable  to  have  them  marked  before  the  tournament,  although 
lawn  tennis  prizes  are  frequently  bought  with  the  privilege  of  ex- 
change, and  therefore  not  engraved  until  after  the  tournament. 

The  committee  should  select  a  referee,  either  from  among  their  num- 
ber or  outside  of  it.  If  handicaps  are  to  be  held,  the  referee  may 
also  be  the  handicapper,  or  a  sub-committee  may  be  appointed  for  this 
purpose.  Should  the  referee  be  also  a  competitor,  a  substitute  should 
also  be  appointed  to  act  for  him  while  he  is  playing. 

It  is  important  to  have  enough  balls,  and  only  the  best  quality  of 
tournament  balls  should  be  used  for  matches.  It  is  the  custom  at  most 
tournaments  to  allow  three  new  balls  with  each  match,  but  in  play- 
ing on  dirt  courts,  the  same  balls  can  sometimes  be  made  to  do  service 
twice.  Unless  there  are  back-stops  close  behind  the  courts,  it  is  also 
well  to  have  some  small  boys  handy  to  act  as  ball-boys  and  "shack" 
the  balls  for  the  players. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  271 

The  lines  of  a  tournament  court  should  be  marked  out  fresh  every 
day  and,  if  easily  obliterated,  also  between  matches  on  the  same  day. 
The  courts  should  always  be  laid  north  and  south  so  that  one  player 
will  not  get  more  than  his  share  of  the  glaring  sunlight  in  his  eyes. 
Therei  should  never  be  a  tree  within  shadow  distance  of  a  tournament 
court  either,  particularly  on  the  south  side  of  the  court. 

Facilities  must  be  provided  for  the  players  to  dress,  and  it  is  a 
good  plan,  to  appoint  one  member  of  the  committee  to  attend  to  these 
accommodations,  and  to  entertain  the  visiting  players  and  see  that 
their  wants  are  attended  to. 

The  draw  should  always  be  posted  in  a  conspicuoua  place  on  the 
grounds,  where  the  spectators  as  well  as  the  players  can  inspect  it. 
If  possible  a  programme  for  each  day's  play  should  be  made  out  in 
advance,  and  due  notice  of  all  the  matches  of  the  day  be  posted  up  by 
the  draw  each  day.  The  courts  should  be  numbered,  and  a  certain 
court  and  hour  set  for  each  match.  One  member  of  the  committee 
ought  also  to  be  assigned  to  getting  umpires  for  the  matches  and 
seeing  that  they  are  properly  started. 

It  is  customary  to  exhibit  the  prizes  for  a  tournament  at  the  club 
grounds  during  the  tournament,  and  it  generally  proves  an  attractive 
feature  to  have  them  displayed  on  a  table  on  the  grounds,  all  duly 
labeled  so  that  spectators  can  see  which  events  they  are  to  be  given 
for.  A  refreshment  tent  is  also  an  attractive  feature  at  a  tourna- 
ment and  the  prizes  are  then  displayed  under  this  tent  on  the  same 
or  a  nearby  table  with  the  punchbowl.  Lemonade,  or  tea,  crackers, 
cakes  and  sometimes  small  sandwiches  are  generally  served  to  the 
players  and  spectators  under  such  refreshment  tent.

272  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

SIMPLE   METHOD   OF   MAKING   THE   DRAW. 

(From  American  Lawn  TenHis..) 
Although  thousands   of  drawinfjs  for    lawn    tennis   tournaments  are 
made   cTery   year   only   a    comparatively    small   number   of    people   are 
familiar    with    the    subject.      The    matter    is    really    very    simple,    and 
making  the  draw  is  easy  if  one  understands  the  modus  operandi. 

The  draw  is  made  according  te  the  Bagnall-Wild  system,  except  in 
round  robin  and  team  matches.  This  system  is  designed  to  bring  the 
players  together  in  a  predetermined  number  of  rounds  and  ultimately 
reduce  them  to  one  player  or  one  team  by  retiring  the  competitors 
defeated  in  each  round.  The  ultimate  player,  or  pair,  is,  of  course, 
the  winner  of  the  tournament.  The  rules  of  the  U.S.N.L.T.A.  forbid 
"seeding"  the  draw  except  in  the  case  of  invitation  tournaments  and 
competitions  between  "nations,  States,  cities,  clubs,"  etc.  ;  and  provide 
that  the  names  of  the  competitors  shall  be  placed  ii^  a  bowl  or  hat 
■vnd  drawn  out  at  random  (see  Regulation  17  on  page  193). 

In  preparing  to  make  the  draw  the  number  of  entries  are  counted. 
If  the  total  is  2,  or  a  power  of  2—4,  8,  16,  32,  64,  128,  256  or  512 — 
there  are  no  byes  and  the  names  are  entered  on  the  draw  sheet  in  the 
order  in  wliich  they  are  drawn.  If  the  total  is  not  2,  or  a  power  of 
2,  there  are  byes,  and  the  Bagnall-Wild  method  of  drawing  is  resorted 
to  ;  and  this  means  nearly  always,  for  the  entries  rarely  total  a  power 
of  2.  This  method  is  really  very  simple  if  it  is  once  thoroughly 
■understood,  but  if  it  is  not  the  drawing  is  qiiite  a  complicated  matter 
and  freedom  from  error  is  not  easily  obtained. 

If  it  is  once  clearly  understood  what  is  the  goal  aimed  at  in  draw- 
ing, all  difficulties  are  passed.  That  goal  is  to 
bring  into  the  second  round  a  number  of 
entries  that  is  a  power  of  2.  Once  that  is  fixed 
in  the  mind  everything  is  easy.  There  must  be 
2,  4,  8,  16,  32,  etc.,  players  (or  pairs)  in  the 
second  round.  To  secure  this  result  is  the 
object  of  the  Bagnall-Wild  system  of  drawing. 

Here  is  a  simple  illustration  of  how  to  draw : 
There  are,  say,  41  entries,  so  the  next  higher 
power  of  2  is  64 ;  subtract  41  from  64,  and  you 
have  the  number  of  byes — 23.  This  leaves  18 
players  in  the  first  round — 23  (byes)  being  sub- 
tracted from  41,  the  total  number  of  entries. 
With  IS  players  in  the  first  round  one-half,  or 
9,  go  into  the  second  round,  where  we  already 
have  23  byes  ;  if  we  add  this  9  to  the  23  byes 
we  have  32,  which  is,  of  course,  a  power  of  2 
and  the  correct  numl)er.  If  the  total  had  been 
31  or  33,  or  any  other  numl)er  than  a  power  of 
2,  it  would  be  apparent  that  there  is  an  error

somewhere.  Never  foi'get  that  the  number  in  the  second  round — byes 
and  players  who  survive  the  first  round — must  be  a  power  of  2,  and 
that  this  "power"  is  obtained  b.v  doubling  2 — as  4.  S,  16,  32,  etc.  Finall.v, 
byes  are  necessary  only  when  the  number  of  entries  is  not  2  or  a  power 
of  2.  For  this  disposition  of  a  difficulty  that  troubled  lawn  tennis 
players  in  the  early  years  of  the  game  we  have  to  thank  the  ingenious 
Mr."  Bagnall-Wild. 

The  rest  is  clear  sailing.  The  names  are  written  on  slips  of  paper 
and  drawn  from  a  hat.  The  byes  are  drawn  first,  and  it  is  not  neces- 
sary to  "copy  the  names  on  a  list,"  as  provided  in  Regulation  15,  for 
the  names  can  now  be  written  on  the  draw  card  or  sheet,  thus  saving 
time.  The  byes  are  written  in  the  space  left  for  the  second  round, 
beginning  at  the  top.  In  the  case  we  are  citing,  with  23  byes,  11 
names  are  written  at  the  top  and  12  at  the  bottom,  as  stated  in  Regu- 
lation 17.  As  there  are  18  players  in  the  first  round,  that  number  of 
spaces  are  left  on  the  draw  card,  in  the  center,  after  the  byes  have 
been  disposed  of,  as  shown. 

The  method  of  drawing  for  doubles  is  exactly  the  same.  The  only 
difference  is  that  a  pair  is  substituted  for  a  single  player. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  273 

SCHEDULE  FOR  A  ROUND   ROBIN  TOURNAMENT. 

To  ascertain  the  number  of  matches  to  be  played  in  a  round 
robin  tournament,  multiply  the  number  of  players  or  teams  by  one 
less  thaji  the  total  nutiiber  and  divide  by  two.  Thus,  if  there  are 
four  players  ®r  teams,  3X4=12-^2  =  6  matches  to  be  played. 

Another  method  is  to  take  the  number  of  players  or  teams  and 
set  down  the  figures,  thus:  4,  3,  2,  1.  Cross  off  the  highest  figure 
and  add  together  (3  +  2  +  1  =  6). 

Where  a  tie  or  ties  occur,  one  or  more  additional  matches  must 
be  played,  unless  the  tie  is  broken  in  some  other  way. 

The  schedule  herewith  provides  an  interesting  doubles  tourna- 
ment for  five  players.  One  player  sits  out  each  time.  The  teams 
play  fowr  games  each  round,  no  matter  how  many  they  win  or  lose. 
The  number  of  games  won  is  placed  in  the  open  brackets  and  the 
man  winning  the  most  games  at  the  end  of  the  fifteen  frames  wins 
the  tournament.

Laws  o£  Lawn  Tennis 

With  *  Explanations  and  Comments,  and  Cases  and  Decisions 
assigned  to  the  Law  by  which  they  are  governed. 

By  Edward  C.  Conlin, 
Chairman  of  the  National  Umpires'  Association. 

During  1919  the  Laws  of  Lawn  Tennis  are  to  be  revised  by 
the  Committee  on  Codification  of  the  Laws  of  Lawn  Tennis 
and  "Cases  and  Decisions,"  this  revision  to  be  presented  to 
the  annual  meeting  of  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis 
Association  in  February,  1920,  for  adoption.  One  of  the  pur- 
poses of  this  arrangement  of  the  Laws  is  to  get  before  the 
players  and  followers  of  the  game  a  reasonably  complete  pre- 
sentment of  the  Laws  and  their  application  at  the  present 
time.  Suggestions  that  will  aid  the  Committee  in  this  work 
are  requested.  They  should  be  sent  to  the  United  States 
National  Lawn  Tennis  Association,  20  Broad  Street,  New  York. 

THE  COURT. 

LAW      The  singles  court  is  78  feet  long  and  27  feet  Dimensions 
1  wide.     It  is  divided  across  the  middle  by  and  equipment 

a  net,  the  ends  of  which  are  attached  to  the  tops  of 
two  posts,  A  and  B,  standing  3  feet  outside  the  court 
on  each  side.  The  height  of  the  net  is  3  feet  6  inches 
at  the  posts,  and  3  feet  in  the  middle.  The  band  at  the 
top  of  the  net  shall  be  not  less  than  2  inches  nor  more 
than  'lyz  inches  in  width,  and  shall  not  have  any  sur- 
plus material  projecting  below  the  sewing  at  the  bottom 
of  said  band.  At  each  end  of  the  court,  parallel  with 
the  net,  and  39  feet  from  it,  are  drawn  the  base  lines, 
C  D  and  E  F,  the  ends  of  which  are  connected  by  the 
side  lines,  C  E  and  D  F.  Half-way  between  the  side 
lines,  and  parallel  with  them,  is  drawn  the  half-court 
line,  G  H,  dividing  the  space  on  each  side  of  the  net 
into  two  equal  parts  called  the  right  and  left  courts. 
On  each  side  of  the  net,  at  a  distance  of  21  feet  from 
it,  and  parallel  with  it,  are  drawn  the  service  lines, 
I  J  and  K  L. 

The  marking   of  the  half-court   line   between   the  Marking, 
service  lines  and  the  base  lines  shall  be  omitted;  but 
the  place  where  the  half-court  line  would  meet  the 
base  lines,  if  it  were  extended,  shall  be  indicated  by

distance  from  the  outside  of  one  base  line  to  the  other 
shall  be  78  feet;  from  outside  of  side  line  to  side 
line  27  feet  for  the  singles  and  36  feet  for  the  doubles 
court;  from  outside  of  service  line  to  service  line  42 
feel. 

Explanation  of  Law  1. 

For  singles  court,  outside  measurement  is  78  feet  long,  27 
feet  wide.  Service  lines,  18  feet  from  the  outside  of  each 
base  line;  half-court  line,  midway  between  the  side  lines 
connecting  the  two  service  lines.  Immediately  in  front  of 
the  base  lines,  a  mark  about  4  inches  long,  half-way 
between  the  two  side  lines.  Width  of  lines:  The  half- 
court  line  not  over  2  inches;  the  other  lines,  usage  calls 
for  1^  to  2  inches  on  dirt  and  1^4  inches  on  grass;  the 
base  line  can  be  wider,  but  must  be  kept  within  the 
maximum  length  of  the  court— 78  feet. 
The  doubles  court  is  the  same  as  the  singles  court  except 
that  the  width  is  36  feet,  side  lines  being  placed  4^  feet 
on  the  outside  of  the  side  lines  of  the  singles  court.  Thus 
the  side  lines  of  the  singles  court  become  the  side  lines 
of  the  service  courts  in  the  doubles  court  and  the  service 
lines  remain  the  same  as  for  the  singles  court.  The  side 
lines  of  the  service  courts  are  to  be  marked  only  to  the 
service  lines  and  not  carried  beyond  the  service  lines  to 
the  base  lines.  This  is  comparatively  new,  but  is  called 
for  in  Law  27.  It  is  permissible,  however,  to  extend  the 
service  side  lines  to  the  base  lines,  as  the  latter  marking 
has  to  be  made  where  a  court  is  to  be  used  for  both 
singles  and  doubles  play. 

Note  that  all  measurements  are  outside  measurements. 
The   posts   are   3   feet   outside   of   the   side  lines   in   both 
singles  and  doubles. 

The  Net:  Should  be  33  feet  wide  for  singles,  42  feet  for 
doubles.  Top  of  the  band  must  be  3  feet  6  inches  from 
the  ground  at  the  posts  and  3  feet  in  the  middle.  The 
band  at  the  top  of  the  net  is  to  be  not  less  than  2  inches 
nor  more  than  2%  inches  in  depth  on  each  side  of  the  net. 
The  net  from  top  to  bottom  should  come  flush  with  the 
net  posts. 

Where  a  singles  match  is  played  on  a  court  marked  for 
doubles,  with  the  net  posts  3  feet  outside  of  the  side  lines 
of  the  double  court,  a  stick  3  feet  6  inches  high  should  be 
placed  3  feet  away  from  the  side  lines  of  the  single  court.

LAW  1. 
to  hold  the  net  up  to  tlie  proper  height  at  the  point  where 
the  net  posts  would  be  on  a  single  court. 
Service  Courts:    There  are  four  of  them,  one  on  the  right 
and  left-hand  side  of  the  half-court  line  on  each  side  of 
the  court,  the  net  being  the  dividing  line.    A  service  court 
consists  of  the  space  bounded  by  the  net,  the  side  line, 
the  service  line  and  the  half-court  line.    The  marks  inside 
of  and  at  the  center  of  the  base  lines  show  where  the  half-* 
court   line   would   come   if   it   extended   from   the   service 
lines  to  the  base  lines,  the  purpose  of  this  being  to  mark 
the  point  within  which  the  server  must  stand. 
The  Alley:    That  space  in  the  doubles  court  which  Kes 
between  the  extreme  side  line  and  the  side  lines  of  the 
service  courts. 

It  is  well  to  have  a  stick,  similar  to  a  piece  of  wooden 
lath,  3  feet  6  inches  long,  with  a  notch  cut  in  at  the  3  foot 
mark,  for  the  purpose  of  measuring  the  height  of  the  net 
at  the  posts  and  in  the  center.  These  measurements 
always  should  be  made  before  starting  to  play. 

THE  BALLS. 

LAW      The   balls    shall    measure   not    less    than  Sizeaad 

2  2  9/16    inches,    nor    more   than   2  10/16  w^'*'** 
inches,  in  diameter;  and  shall  weigh  not  less  than  2 
ounces  nor  more  than  2  1/16  ounces. 

Explanation  of  Law  2. 

How  often  can  the  players  have  new  balls?  is  a  question 
that  is  frequently  asked.  No  official  ruling  on  this  has 
ever  been  made.  In  big  matches,  new  balls  are  always 
given  the  players  at  the  start  of  a  set,  and  it  has  been 
customary  to  give  new  balls  during  a  set  as  often  as  a 
player  asks  for  them.  He  usually  asks  his  opponent  if  he 
has  any  objection,  and  it  is  seldom  that  there  is  objec- 
tion. It  would  seem  to  me  that  the  Umpire  should  decide 
as  to  the  necessity  of  new  balls  and  an  appeal  from  his 
decision  to  the  Referee  be  permitted.  This,  however,  is 
my  comment  and  not  official. 

Should  a  ball  become  broken  through  hitting,  a  "let** 
should  be  called.

LAW  3. 

the  other  player  shall  have  the  choice  of  sides,  and 
vice  versa;  or  the  winner  of  the  toss  may  insist  upon 
a  choice  by  his  opponent.  If  one  player  choose  the 
court  the  other  may  elect  not  to  serve. 

Explanation  of  Law  3. 

The  last  section  of  this  rule  should  be  changed  to  read: 
If  one  player  choose  the  court,  the  other  may  elect  to  serve 
or  not,  as  he  wishes. 

The  toss  is  usually  made  by  one  player  twirling  a  racket 
in  the  air,  the  other  calling  "rough"  or  "smooth";  which 
means  that  when  the  racket  falls,  the  fine  stringing  (the 
trimming)  at  the  head  of  the  racket  will  have  the  rough  or 
the  smooth  side  up  when  the  racket  falls  to  the  ground. 

How  game     LAW      The  players  shall  stand  on  opposite  sides

ball  shall  be  called  the  Server,  and  the  other  the 
Striker-out. 

Explanation  of  Law  4. 

The  striker-out  may  stand  in  any  part  of  the  court  that 
he  wishes  to,  or  in  the  space  outside  of  his  court,  83  long 
as  he  keeps  on  his  side  of  the  net. 

Cases  and  Decisions. 

Case  1 — A  player  returns  the  ball,  and,  finding  that  he 
cannot  stop  himself  before  reaching  the  net,  jumps  over  it. 
Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision — Law  4  requires  that  "the  players  shall  stand 
on  opposite  sides  of  the  net,"  and  therefore  the  player 
invading  his  opponent's  court  loses  the  stroke. 

— James  Dwight. 

Case  2 — The  server  claims  that  the  striker-out  must  stand 

in  the  court.    Is  this  necessary? 

Decision — No.  The  striker-out  can  stand  wherever  he 
pleases  on  his  own  side  of  the  net. — James  Dwight. 

Case  3 — A  cuts  the  ball  just  over  the  net  and  it  returns 
to  A's  side.  B,  unable  to  reach  the  ball,  throws  his  racket 
and  hits  the  ball.  Both  racket  and  ball  fall  over  the  net 
on  A's  court.  A  returns  the  ball,  which  goes  outside  of 
B's  court.    Who  gets  the  point? 

Decision — When  B  threw  his  racket  across  the  net  at 
the  ball  he  invaded  his  opponent's  territory  and  such 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  279

an    invasion    was    in    a   measure   responsible   for   A's 
returning   the  ball   out   of  court;    in  other  words,   B 
would  lose  the  point. — R.  D.  Wrenn. 

Case  4 — In  a  doubles  competition  the  server  claims  the 
right  to  stand  at  the  corner  of  the  court  as  marked  by  the 
double  side  lines  (the  single  court  side  lines  not  being 
marked).  Is  the  foregoing  correct  or  is  it  necessary  that 
the  server  stand  within  the  limits  of  the  imaginary  con- 
tinuation of  the  half-court  and  the  singles  court  side  lines? 
Decision — The  server  has  the  right  to  stand  at  the 
corner  of  the  court  as  marked  by  the  double  side  lines. 

— R.  D.  Wrenn. 

Case  5 — In  doubles,  is  it  allowable  for  the  partner  of  the 
server  to  stand  in  the  center  of  the  service  court  and 
thereby  obstruct  the  view  of  the  striker-out? 

Decision — The  partner  of  the  server  may  take  any 
position  in  the  court  that  he  wishes,  whether  it 
obstructs  the  view  of  the  striker-out  or  not. 

— R.  D.  Wrenn.

become  striker-out;  and  so  on  alternately  in  all  the 
subsequent  games  of  the  set  and  following  sets. 

FOOT  FAULT  RULE. 

LAW      Before    commencing    to    serve,    the   server   How  player 

6  shall  stand  with  both  feet  at  rest  behind    shall  serve, 
(i.  e.,  further  from  the  net  than)   the  base  line  and 

within  the  limits  of  the  imaginary  continuation  of  the 
half-court  and  side  lines,  and  thereafter  the  server 
shall  not  run,  walk,  hop  or  jump  before  the  service 
has  been  delivered,  but  the  server  may  raise  one  foot 
from  (and,  if  desired,  replace  it  on)  the  ground,  pro- 
vided that  both  feet  are  kept  behind  the  base  line  until 
the  service  has  been  delivered. 

O^cial  interpretation  of  Law  6: 

If  a  foot  be  lifted  and  replaced,  there  must 
be  no  change  of  position  that  can  possibly 
be  considered  a  step. 

Definitions  and  further  interpretations  made  by  the 
Executive  Committee : 


'280  BPALDING'8    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

LAW   6. 

Definitions       1.     "The   service  has   been   delivered"   at  the  instant   of  the 
of  proper   contact  of  the  ball  and  racket.     (It  makes  no  difference  what 
s-srvice.   the  server  does  after  the  contact  of  the  ball  and  racket.) 

2.  It  is  a  hop  or  jump  if  both  of  a  player's  feet  are  off  the 
ground  at  the  same  time. 

3.  The  grounded  foot  may  be  twisted  without  committing 
a  foot  fault,  PROVIDED  that  any  part  of  it  retains  its  contact 
with  the  ground. 

4.  After  standing  at  rest  preparatory  to  serving,  there  must 
be  no  change  of  position  that  can  possibly  be  considered  a 
step,  no  matter  how  far  back  of  the  base  line  the  server  may 
take  his  stand.  Moving  one  of  the  feet  to  another  resting 
place  's  a  step,  but  a  step  is  not  actually  taken  until  the  lifted 
foot  is  replaced  on  the  ground. 

5.  The  server  must  come  to  a  complete  stop  before  tossing 
the  ball  in  the  air.  Both  feet  must  be  kept  behind  the  base 
line  and  one  foot  must  remain  on  the  ground  until  the  contact 
of  the  ball  and  racket.  The  racket  and  any  portion  of  the 
body  EXCEPT  THE  FEET  may  cross  the  base  line  prior  to 
the  contact  of  the  ball  and  racket. 

Explanation  of  Law  6. 

It  is  a  fault  if  the  server  touch  or  cross  the  base  line 
before  striking  the  ball  (the  racket  and  any  part  of  the 
server's  body  except  his  feet  may  cross  the  base  line 
before  striking  the  ball)  ;  if  he  raises  one  foot  and  puts  it 
down  farther  forward  than  it  was  originally;  if  he  makes 
any  movement  that  can  be  construed  as  a  step  or  a  hop, 
skip  or  jump;  if  both  feet  leave  the  ground  before  the 
ball  is  struck;  or  if  the  foot  is  sivung  forivard  over  the 
base  line  {whether  it  touches  the  ground  or  not  after 
being  lifted)  before  the  moment  of  impact. 
The  server  must  stand  behind  the  base  line,  within  the 
limits  of  the  side  lines  of  the  court  in  which  he  is  playing. 
In  singles,  the  server  must  stand  between  the  imaginary 
continuation  of  the  half-court  and  side  service  lines,  but 
in  doubles  he  is  permitted  to  stand  between  the  imaginary 
continuation  of  the  half-court  and  the  extreme  outside 
lines. — R.  D.  Wrenn. 

Decision — T-here  is  no  restriction  in  the  regulations 
regarding  the  kind  of  service  which  may  be  used; 
that  is,  the  player  may  use  an  underhand  or  an  over- 
hand service  at  his  discretion.^R.  D.  Wrenn. 

Cases  and  Decisions. 

Case  1 — Is  it  a  violation  of  the  rules  if  the  server  should 
put  his  foot  on  the  base  line  while  serving? 

Decision — If  the  server's  foot  touches  the  base  line, 
even  though  it  be  an  inch  over  the  line,  it  is  a  fault. 

— R.  D.  Wrenn. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS     ANNUAL.  281 

LAW  6. 
Case  2— In  serving,  I  understand,  it  is  permissible  to  raise 
one  foot  off  the  ground,  but  would  like  to  know  whether, 
in  bringing  the  foot  back  on  the  ground,  it  is  allowable 
to  step  inside  of  the  base  line,  either  before  or  after  the 
baU  hits  the  ground  or  the  net? 

Decision — The  server  cannot  have  either  foot  inside  of 
the  base  line  until  after  the  baU  has  left  his  racket. 

— R.  D.  Wrenn. 

At  a  match  where  there  is  no  Foot-Fault  Judge,  an 
Umpire  can  call  foot  faults  from  the  chair,  when  it  is 
quite  evident  to  him  that  they  are  being  made.  Section  B 
of  Article  9  of  Regulations  for  the  Management  of  Tour- 
naments gives  him  this  power. 


LAW      The   service   shall    be   delivered    from   the  Howserviee 
7  right  and  left  courts  alternately,  beginning  's  d«Hv«red. 

from  the  right  in  every  game,  even  though  odds  be 
given  or  owed,  and  the  ball  served  shall  drop  within 
the  service  line,  half-court  line  and  side  line  of  the 
court  which  is  diagonally  opposite  to  that  from  which 
it  was  served  or  upon  any  such  line. 

Elxplanation  of  Law  7. 

I  suggest  that  the  following  sentence  be  added  to  Law  7: 
The  end  of  the  game  or  set  does  not  change  this  rotation. 

It  should  be  remembered,  in  handicap  matches,  that  the 
server  starts  to  serve  from  the  right-hand  court,  no  matter 
whether  odds  be  given  or  owed;  and  that  a  ball  strikin.'^ 
within  or  on  any  line  of  the  proper  service  court  is  good. 

The  services  must  always  come  alternately  from  the  right 
and  left  courts;  if  the  server  delivers  the  ball  from  the 
wrong  court,  it  is  a  fault. 

A  ball  served  with  a  sharp  cut  that  bounds  back  over  the 
net  after  having  struck  in  the  right  court  is  a  good  ser- 
vice. The  point  counts  in  favor  of  the  server  if  the  striker- 
out  fails  to  return  it.  The  latter  may  reach  over  the  net 
to  return  such  a  ball,  but  loses  the  point  if  he  touches  the 
net  in  doing  so. 

In  the  absence  of  a  Linesman  and  Umpire,  it  is  the  func- 
tion of  the  receiver  to  determine  whether  the  service  is 
good  or  not.

LAW  7. 

Cases  and  Decisions. 

Case  1 — A   player  receiving  fifteen,  serves  from  the  left 

court.     His  opponent  claims  a  fault. 

Decision — It  is  a  fault.  The  service  starts  from  the 
right  court  under  aU  circumstances. — James  Dwight. 

Case  2 — The  first  ball  served — a  fault — strikes  the  back- 
stop and  bounds  back,  interfering  with  the  receiver  at  the 
time  of  second  service.     Can  he  claim  a  "let"? 
Decision — ^Yes. — American  Lawn  Tennis. 

Faults.     LAW      It  is  a  fault  if  the  server  commit  any  breach 
8  of  Law  7,  or  if  he  does  not  stand  as  directed 

in  Law  6,  or  if  the  ball  served  drop  in  the  net  (or  go 
through  it),  or  beyond  the  service  line,  or  if  it  drop 
out  of  court  or  in  the  wrong  court.  If  the  server, 
in  attempting  to  serve,  miss  the  ball  altogether,  it  does 
not  count  as  a  fault;  but  if  the  ball  be  touched,  no 
matter  how  slightly,  by  the  racket,  or  by  the  server 
or  anything  that  he  wears  or  carries,  a  service  is 
thereby  delivered,  and  the  laws  governing  the  service 
at  once  apply. 

Explanation  of  Law  8. 

This  is  very  plain.  It  may  be  well  to  point  out  that  if  the 
server  toss  up  the  ball  to  serve  and  does  not  strike  it  with 
his  racket  but  catches  it  before  it  touches  the  ground,  it 
is  a  fault.   Tliis  fault  is  frequently  made  and  seldom  called. 

Cases  and  Decisions. 

Case  1 — A  player  serves  from  the  wrong  court;  he  loses 
the  stroke,  and  then  claims  that  it  was  a  fault. 

Decision — If  the  stroke  was  played  on  his  first  service, 
it  is  simply  a  fault;  but  if  he  serves  twice  into  the 
wrong  court,  he  has  served  two  faults  and  lost  the 
stroke. — James  Dwight. 

Case  2 — If  when  the  ball  is  served,  it  hits  the  net  and 
goes  over  but  not  in  the  correct  receiver's  box,  is  it  a  good 
service  or  not? 

Decision — It  is  a  fault. — R.  D.  Wrenn. 

Case  3 — A  serves  to  B;  the  ball  hits  the  branch  of  a  tree 
overhanging  the  court  and  drops  into  fair  territory.  Is  the 
ball  good  or  out? 

Decision — The  server  will  lose  the  point.

Explanation  of  Law  9. 

This  means  that  a  service  that  does  not  strike  in  the 
proper  service  court  cannot  be  returned. 

A  fault  cannot  be  played,  and  the  striker-out  has  no 
option  in  the  matter;  it  does  not  make  the  service  good  if 
he  returns  it. 

Cases  and   Decisions. 

Case  1 — A  player  serves  from  the  wrong  court;  he  loses 

the  stroke,  and  then  claims  that  it  was  a  fault. 

Decision — If  the  stroke  was  played  in  his  first  service, 
it  is  simply  a  fault;  but  if  he  serves  twice  into  the 
wrong  court,  he  has  served  two  faults  and  lost  the 
stroke. — James  Dwight. 

Case  2 — Score,  30-15;  the  server  served  from  the  wrong 
court;  no  one  noticed  it.  Just  as  the  server  was  about  to 
serve  the  next  ball,  he  remarks,  "I  am  in  the  wrong  court 
and  must  have  served  last  from  the  wrong  court."  All 
agree  that  he  served  from  the  wrong  court.  Does  the  point 
stand  or  does  he  lose  the  point,  since  he  had  not  served 
the  next  ball? 

Decision — The  point  does  not  stand.  If  he  served  two 
balls  into  the  wrong  court,  he  made  a  double  faiJt. 
If  he  served  only  one  ball,  he  still  has  the  privilege 
of  playing  the  point  over,  but  has  only  one  service.

Explanation  of  Law   10. 

If  the  server  starts  to  serve  from  the  wrong  court  and  the 
point  is  played  out  and  the  error  is  then  discovered,  it  is 
a  fault,  no  matter  whether  the  server  wins  or  loses  the 
point.  He  shall  then  serve  the  second  ball  from  the  proper 
court.  Should  he  serve  both  balls  from  the  wrong  court, 
it  is  a  double  fault;  the  server  loses  the  point  and  he 
shall  then  serve  from  the  proper  court.

ball),  whether  it  be  good  or  a  fault,  and  stands  as  the 
play  decided  it. 

Cases  and  Decisions. 

Case  1 — At  fifteen-all  the  server  by  mistake  serves  from 
the  left  court,  he  wins  the  stroke  and  serves  again  (a 
fault),  the  mistake  is  then  discovered.  Is  he  entitled  to 
the  previous  fault?  From  which  court  should  he  serve 
next? 

Decision — The  previous  stroke  stands.  A  fault  cannot 
be  claimed  after  ths  next  service,  go^d  or  not,  is  deliv- 
ered. The  next  service  should  be  from  the  left  court, 
the  score  being  30-15,  and  the  server  has  served  one 
fault. 

Case  2 — After  some  preliminary,  the  server  served  from 
the  wrong  court.  It  was  not  noticed  by  the  striker-out  or 
the  Umpire.  The  point  was  hotly  contested  and  finally 
■went  to  the  server,  ending  the  game,  set  and  match.  As 
the  contestants  were  going  to  the  clubhouse,  a  spectator 
called  the  attention  of  the  Umpire  to  the  mistake.  There 
had,  of  course,  been  no  chance  for  another  service,  which 
would  have  condoned  the  mistake.  Must  the  Umpire  order 
the  game  reopened,  give  the  point  to  the  striker-out,  thus 
bringing  the  score  back  to  deuce? 

Decision — The  point  goes  to  the  server,  and  the  match 
is  finished  and  over.  The  Umpire  should  not,  under 
any  circumstances,  order  the  game  reopened.

Ball  not  to     LAW      The  server  shall  not  serve  till  the  striker- 
be  served  till         12         out  is  ready.     If  the  latter  attempt  to  return 
^  is  ready.  *^®  seivice,  he  shall  be  deemed  ready. 

Explanation  of  Law  12. 

By  this  rule  the  striker-out  can  refuse  the  service  if  he  is 
not  ready  for  it.  If,  however,  he  makes  any  apparent 
attempt  to  return  it,  he  shall  be  deemed  ready  and  the 
point  scored  against  him. 

The  server  must  wait  until  the  striker-out  is  ready  for  the 
second  service  as  well  as  the  first,  and  if  the  striker-out 
claims  to  be  not  ready  and  does  not  make  any  effort  to 
return  the  second  service,  the  server  cannot  claim  the 
point,  even  though  the  service  was  good.

Cases  and   Decisions. 

Case  1 — The  service  is  delivered  before  the  striker-out  is 
ready.  He  tries  to  return  it  and  fails.  Is  he  entitled  to 
have  it  played  over  again? 

Decision — No;  if  he  attempts  to  return  the  service,  he 

is  deemed  ready. 

Case  2 — The  striker-out  calls  "not  ready,"  for  a  second 
service.  The  ball  strikes  beyond  the  service  line,  and  the 
striker-out  claims  that  the  fact  that  he  -was  not  ready 
makes  no  difference,  since  a  fault  cannot  be  returned, 
and,  therefore,  that  two  faults  have  beer\  served. 

Decision — The  second  service  goes  for  nothing.  A 
player  cannot  call  "not  ready,"  and  then  have  the 
service  count,  or  not,  as  suits  his  interests. 

Case  3 — In  receiving  the  service,  a  second  ball  was  served 
to  me  while  the  first  one  (a  "let")  was  still  in  the  air, 
and  the  two  came  into  contact.  I  made  no  attempt  to 
accept  the  second  service. 

Decision — The  fact  that  the  first  ball  was  still  in  the 
air,  over  the  service  court,  was  clear  evidence  that 
you  were  "not  ready"  to  accept  the  second  service.  It 
should  be  called  a  "let"  and  another  ball  served  to 
you. — American  Lawn  Tennis. 

LAW     A    service    or    fault    delivered    when    tlie  wiien  service

remains  in  play  till  the  stroke  is  decided. 

Explanation  of  Law   15. 

This  is  perfectly  clear,  except  that  the  ball  can  become 
dead  by  the  players  being  interfered  with  by  something 
beyond  their  control. 


266  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

LAW    15, 

If  one  partner  of  a  doubles  team  strikes  at  a  ball  and 
does  not  touch  it,  his  partner  still  has  the  right  to  return 
it.  A  player  or  different  member  of  a  team  may  strike  at 
a  ball  as  often  as  they  please;  it  is  still  in  play  until  hit. 
The  ball  is  always  in  play  until  it  has  struck  the  ground 
outside  of  the  court,  or  the  net,  or  has  touched  the  ground 
twice.  The  player  loses  a  point  if  the  ball  touches  him  or 
his  clothing  while  still  in  play,  no  matter  whether  he  is 
standing  outside  of  the  court  when  the  ball  hits  him, 
or  not. 

Tf  in  the  Umpire's  opinion  a  call  by  an  unauthorized 
person  actually  interferes  with  a  contestant's  playing  of 
the  stroke,  the  point  should  be  played  over. 

A  ball  is  dead  the  instant  it  has  touched  the  ground  out- 
side of  the  court,  and  the  point  must  be  scored  at  once 
against  the  other  side,  no  matter  what  happens  after  the 
ball  touches  the  ground. 

Cases  and  Decisions. 

Case  1 — A  ball  drops  near  a  line,  the  player  appeals,  and 
the  Umpire  calls  "play."  The  player  misunderstands  the 
call  and  lets  the  ball  fall.  He  then  claims  to  have  the 
stroke  played  again. 

Decision — The  stroke  stands. — James  Dwight. 

The  English  ruling  on  this  (No.  4  of  Knotty  Points)  is  a 
"let"  and  is  in  accord  with  logic  and  common  sense. 
Under  our  rules  we  have  to  be  guided  by  Dr.  Dwight's 
decision. 

Case  2 — In  a  doubles  match,  is  one  of  the  players  allowed 
to  tell  his  partner  to  let  the  return  volley  go  (when  it 
may  be  going  out)  or  must  he  keep  silent?  Does  the 
telling  his  partner  count  against  his  side  so  that  the  oppo- 
nent's side  may  claim  the  point? 

Decision — In  a  doubles  match,  the  player  can  give  his 
partner  any  advice  he  wishes  and  is  at  perfect  liberty 
to  tell  his  partner  to  let  a  return  volley  go,  if,  in  his 
opinion,  it  is  going  out. — R.  D.  Wrenn. 

Case  3 — A  ball  was  driven  to  the  base  line  of  the  oppo- 
nent's court.  The  latter  was  in  doubt  whether  it  was 
good  or  not  and  he  called  to  the  Umpire  for  a  decision. 
The  Umpire  not  being  able  to  give  an  instant  decision, 
directed  the  men  to  continue  playing.  They  did  so,  and, 
finally,  the  man  who  asked  for  the  decision,  knocked  the 
ball  out  of  court.  The  Umpire  had  by  that  time  con- 
firmed his  first  impression — that  the  disputed  ball  was 
out — and  he  awarded  the  point  to  the  player  who  had,  in

16         touch  the  net  in  going  into  the  proper  court; 
but  a  service,  otherwise  good,  which  touches  the  net 
shall  count  for  nothing  and  shall  be  termed  a  "let." 

Explanation  of  Law  16. 

During  the  service,  a  ball  that  touches  the  net  in  going 
into  the  proper  court  is  termed  a  "let"  and  counts  for  noth- 
ing, another  service  being  delivered.  If  the  ball  touches 
the  net  when  going  into  the  proper  court  during  a  rally, 
it  is  good. 

A  served  ball  is  only  a  "let"  if  otherwise  good,  falling  in 
the  proper  court;  a  fault  cannot  be  a  "let." 

There  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of  "let"  balls  that  may 
be  made  on  the  service,  and  the  server  continues  serving 
in  the  same  court  until  a  good  service  is  delivered  or  two 
faults  are  made. 

A  return  made  from  outside  of  the  court  that  passes  out- 
side of  the  net  and  posts  without  going  over  them  is  still 
good  if  the  ball  falls  in  the  proper  court. 

An  officially  recognized  decision  has  been  rendered  that 
makes  any  support  of  the  net — the  posts,  the  guy-ropes,  or 
the  center  fork — a  part  of  the  net  itself,  and  any  ball  hit- 
ting one  of  the  supports  and  still  striking  the  right  court 
is  considered  a  good  return  (except  on  the  service).  The 
posts  are  required  to  stand  outside  of  the  court,  and  yet  a 
ball  being  returned  at  a  sharp  angle  from  outside  might 
well  be  going  in  and  still  touch  one  of  the  posts. 

A  return  that  passes  between  the  net  post  and  the  net 
but  below  the  top  cord  of  the  net,  is  not  a  good  return 
because  the  net  should  fit  flush  to  the  net  posts.  The 
purpose  of  the  net  is  to  serve  as  a  barrier,  from  post  to 
post,  between  the  players.

Case  1 — A  ball  passes  outside  the  post  of  the  net  and

LAW  16. 

Case  2 — A  ball  going  out  of  court  hits  the  top  of  the  posts 
of  the  net  and  bounds  into  the  opposite  court. 

Decision — It  is  a  good  return. — James  Dwight. 

Case  3 — The   service  or  the  ball   in   play  strikes  a  ball 

lying  in  the  court.    Can  it  be  returned? 

Decision — Yes,  if  it  is  clear  to  the  Umpire  that  the 
right  ball  is  returned. — James  Dwight. 

Case  4 — A  return  strikes  the  cord  running  along  the  bot- 
tom of  the  net  and  bounds  over.     Is  it  a  good  return? 
Decision — Yes. — James  Dwight. 

Case  5 — A  leaves  a  ball  in  his  own  court,  and  during  the 
course  of  play  B  returns  a  ball  which  strikes  the  other 
ball. 

Decision — A  may  still  return  the  ball  in  play. 

— R.  D.  Wrenn. 

Case  6 — The  first  ball  served  was  a  fault,  but  instead  of 
rolling  outside  the  lines  of  the  court,  it  remains  about  in 
the  center  of  the  court  on  the  same  side  of  the  net  from 
which  the  ball  had  been  served.  The  second  ball  was 
good  and,  after  being  returned  four  or  five  times,  it  struck 
the  first  ball,  taking  a  bad  bound,  the  player  being  unable 
to  return  it. 

Decision — The  server  (i.e.,  the  man  in  whose  court 
the  ball  was  left)  would  lose  the  point.  It  is  his 
business  to  keep  the  balls  out  of  the  court,  and  in 
this  case  he  could  have  stopped  between  his  services 
to  remove  the  ball  in  question. — R.  D.  Wrenn. 

Case  7 — Is  it  a  good  return  if  the  striker-out  returns  a 
service  holding  the  racket  in  both  hands? 

Decision — Yes. 

LAW  The  server  wins  a  stroke  if  the  striker-out 
1 7  volley  the  service,  or  if  he  fail  to  return  the 
service  or  the  ball  in  play;  or  if  he  return  the  service 
or  the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  oppo- 
nent's court;  or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke,  as  pro- 
vided by  Law  20. 

Explanation  of  Law  17. 

The  server  wins  the  point  if  the  striker-out  hits  the  service 
before  it  strikes  the  ground  or  lands  into  the  proper  ser- 
vice court;  or  if,  in  returning  a  good  service,  he  drives 
the  ball  into  the  net  or  out  of  the  court;  or  if  he  other- 
wise loses  a  stroke  as  provided  by  Law  20. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  289 

LAW  17. 

A  player  does  not  lose  a  stroke  for  striking  at  a  ball  that 
ultimately  falls  outside  his  court,  provided  he  does  not 
touch  it  in  doing  so. 

Cases  and   Decisions. 

Case  14 — A  player  is  struck  by  the  ball  served  before  it 
has  touched  the  ground,  he  being  outside  of  the  service 
court.    How  does  it  count? 

Decision — The  player  struck  loses  the  stroke.  The 
service  is  presumably  good  until  it  strikes  in  the 
wrong  court.  A  player  cannot  take  the  decision  upon 
himself  by  stopping  the  ball.  If  it  is  going  to  be  a 
fault,  he  has  only  to  get  out  of  the  way. 

— James  Dwight. 

LAW      The  striker-out  wins  a  stroke  if  the  server  when 
18         serve  two  consecutive  fauhs,  or  if  he  fail  striker-out 
to  return  the  ball  in  play,  or  if  he  return  the  ball  in  *'"'  ^*''°''*' 
play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  opponent's  court, 
or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke  as  provided  by  Law  20. 

Explanation  of  Law  18. 

The  striker-out  wins  the  point  if  the  server  serves  a  double 
fault,  or  if  the  server  drives  the  ball  out  of  the  court,  or 
if  he  fails  to  return  it,  or  if  he  otherwise  loses  a  stroke 
as  provided  by  Law  20. 

A  player  does  not  lose  a  stroke  for  striking  at  a  ball  that 
ultimately  falls  outside  his  court,  provided  he  does  not 
touch  it  in  doing  so. 

Cases  and  Decisions. 

Case  1 — A  ball  drops  near  a  line,  the  player  appeals,  and 
the  Umpire  calls  "play."  The  player  misunderstands  the 
call  and  lets  the  ball  fall.  He  then  claims  to  have  the 
stroke  played  again. 

Decision — The  stroke  stands. — James  Dwight, 

Case  2 — A  high  line  ball  is  struck  by  the  man  playing  at 
the  net  and  by  the  man  playing  back  (usually  the  server), 
both  players  missing  the  ball,  which  drops  outside  the 
court  and  neither  of  the  men  calling  "out"  (before  the 
first  man  struck  at  it),  who  wins  the  point? 

Decision — The  point  is  won  by  the  man  who  struck 
at  the  ball  and  missed  it.  The  fact  that  either  of  the 
players  had  tried  to  hit  the  ball  has  no  bearing  on 
the  case.  The  man  who  played  the  ball  out  of  court 
loses  the  point. — R.  D.  Wrenn.

the  ball  is  in  play;  or  if  he  volley  the  ball  before  it 
has  passed  the  net. 

Explanation  of  Law  20. 

Should  the  ball  touch  a  player  while  it  is  in  play,  no  mat- 
ter if  the  player  is  standing  in  or  out  of  the  court,  he  loses 
the  point,  and  it  should  be  remembered  that  a  ball  is 
good  until  it  strikes  the  ground  outside  of  the  court. 
Should  the  player's  racket  touch  the  net,  the  posts  or  any 
part  of  them,  or  if  he  steps  into  his  opponent's  court,  or 
drops  his  racket  into  his  opponent's  court  while  the  ball 
is  still  in  play,  he  loses  the  point.  If  his  racket  strikes 
the  ball  before  it  comes  over  the  net  into  his  court,  he 
loses  the  point.  lie  can,  however,  strike  the  ball  while  it 
Is  in  his  court  and  permit  his  racket  to  follow  the  ball 
across  the  net  without  losing  the  point. 

A  ball  served  with  a  sharp  cut  that  bounds  back  over  the 
net  after  having  struck  in  the  right  court  is  a  good  ser- 
vice. The  point  counts  in  favor  of  the  server  if  the 
striker-out  fails  to  return  it.  The  latter  may  reach  over 
the  net  to  return  such  a  ball,  but  loses  the  point  if  he 
touches  the  net  in  doing  so. 

Cases  and  Decisions. 

Case  1 — A  player  standing  outside  the  court  volleys  the 
ball  or  catches  it  in  his  hand,  and  claims  the  stroke 
because  the  ball  was  certainly  going  out  of  court. 

Decision — He  loses  the  stroke.  It  makes  no  difference 
where  he  was  standing.  The  return  is  presumed  good 
until  it  strikes  the  ground  outside  of  the  court. 

— James  Dwight. 

Case  2 — A  ball  having  been  played  over  the  net  bounds 
back   into   the   court   from   which   it   came.      The   player

reaches  over  the  net  and  plays  it  before  it  falls.  Has  he 
a  right  to  do  so? 

Decision — Yes,  provided  he  does  not  touch  the  net. 
He  has  a  right  to  play  the  ball  at  any  time  from  the 
moment  it  crosses  the  net  into  his  court  until  it 
touches  the  ground  a  second  time. — James  Dwight. 

Case  3 — A  ball  is  played  into  the  net;  the  player  on  the 
other  side,  thinking  that  the  ball  is  coming  over,  strikes 
at  it  and  hits  the  net.     Who  loses  the  stroke? 

Decision — It  is  simplv  a  question  of  fact  for  the 
Umpire  to  decide.  If  tlie  player  touch  the  net  while 
the  ball  was  still  in  play,  he  loses  the  stroke. 

— James  Dwight. 

Case  4 — Can  a  player  follow  a  ball  over  the  net  with  his 
racket,  provided  that  he  hits  the  ball  on  his  own  side  of 
the  net? 

Decision — Yes;  the  only  restrictions  are  that  he  shall 
not  volley  the  ball  until  it  has  crossed  the  net,  and 
that  he  shall  not  touch  the  net  or  any  of  its  supports. 

— James  Dwight. 

Case  5 — A  player's  racket  slips  out  of  his  hand  and  flies 
into  the  net.    Does  he  lose  the  stroke  for  hitting  the  net? 

Decision — Yes,  if  the  ball  be  still  in  play.  It  does  not 
matter  if  the  racket  be  in  a  player's  hand  or  not. 

— James  Dwight. 

Case  6 — A  player's  racket  leaves  his  hand,  but  meets  the 
baU  and  returns  it  over  the  net.    Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision — Yes.  There  is  no  law  requiring  a  racket  to 
be  in  a  player's  hand  when  the  ball  is  returned.  It 
would  unquestionably  be  a  good  return  if  the  racket 
were  held  against  the  ground  by  a  player's  feet,  and 
the  ball  bounded  back  off  of  it. — James  Dwight. 

Case  7 — A  singles  match  is  played  with  a  doubles  net  and 
inside  posts.  A  player  touches  the  net  beyond  the  inside 
posts  and  claims  that  he  does  not  lose  the  stroke  because 
there  should  be  no  net  more  than  three  feet  outside  of  the 
court. 

Decision — He  loses  the  stroke.  Tlie  net  where  he 
touches  it  is  part  of  the  supports  of  the  net.  He 
might,  perhaps,  have  objected  to  the  arrangement  of 
the  net  tefore  the  match. — James  Dwight. 

Case  8 — During  a  rally  the  ball  strikes  the  net,  and  after

either  side,  the  player  who  was  about  to  return  the  ball 
hits  the  net  with  his  racket.    Who  wins  the  point? 

Decision — The  player  who  hits  the  net  with  his  racket 
loses  the  point  on  the  ground  that  the  ball  is  not  dead 
until  it  strikes  the  ground  or  is  caught  fast  in  the 
lower  part  of  the  net.  It  is  perfectly  possible  to  con- 
ceive a  case  where  the  ball  would  strike  several  inches 
under  the  net  band,  but  still  would  roll  over  because 
of  a  heavy  top  spin  or  because  it  had  been  played  up 
from  directly  under  the  net. — R.  D.  Wrenn. 

Case  9 — A  and  B  are  playing  and  B  returns  the  ball  to  A, 
who  is  in  the  back  part  of  the  court,  but  runs  up  and 
smashes  the  ball,  which  bounds  along  the  ground  three  or 
four  times  before  A  runs  into  the  net.  A  claims  it  is  his 
point,  as  the  ball  was  dead  (having  hit  the  ground  three  or 
four  times)  before  he  ran  into  the  net.  B  claims  it  is  his 
point,  as  A  violated  the  rules  by  running  into  the  net. 

Decision — A  wins  this  point,  since  he  did  not  touch 
the  net  until  after  the  ball  was  dead;  that  is,  ceased 
to  be  in  play. — R.  D.  Wrenn. 

Case  10 — A  and  B  are  playing  C  and  D  (doubles).  D  is 
serving.  A  returns  the  ball  over  C's  head,  but  C  strikes 
at  it  but  does  not  touch  the  ball,  but  does  hit  the  net  with 
his  racket.  Then  D  makes  a  successful  return  of  the  ball. 
The  question  is,  Do  C  and  D  lose  the  point  by  reason  of 
C  hitting  the  net  while  the  ball  is  still  in  play? 

Decision — C  and  D  lose  the  point. — R.  D.  Wrenn. 

A  "let."     LAW      In  case  a  player  is  obstructed  by  any  acci- 
21  dent  not  within  his  control,  the  ball  shall 

be  considered  a  "let."  But  when  a  permanent  fixture 
of  the  court  is  the  cause  of  the  accident  the  point  shall 
be  counted.  The  benches  and  chairs  placed  around 
the  court,  and  the  umpire  and  linesmen,  shall  be  con- 
sidered permanent  fixtures.  If,  however,  a  ball  in 
play  strike  a  permanent  fixture  of  the  court  (other 
than  the  net  or  posts)  before  it  touches  the  ground, 
the  point  is  lost;  if  after  it  has  touched  the  ground, 
the  point  shall  be  played  out. 

Explanation  of  Law  21. 

This  means  that  if  in  the  Umpire's  judgment  a  player  is 
interfered  with  by  the  gallery  or  someone  standing  near 
the  court  while  he  is  playing,  the  ball  is  considered  a 
"let"  and  does  not  count;   but  if  it  strikes  in  the  right

LAW  21. 

court  and  on  the  first  bound  hits  a  backstop,  bench  or 
chair  placed  around  the  court,  or  an  Umpire  or  a  Lines- 
man, these  are  considered  permanent  fixtures  and  the  point 
shall  be  played  out.  If,  however,  a  ball  should  strike  any 
of  these  before  it  touches  the  ground,  the  point  is  lost, 
but  it  has  to  be  played  if  it  has  touched  the  ground  inside 
the  proper  court. 

An  officially  recognized  decision  has  been  rendered  that 
makes  any  support  of  the  net — the  posts,  the  guy-ropes,  or 
the  center  fork — a  part  of  the  net  itself,  and  any  ball  hit- 
ting one  of  the  supports  and  still  striking  the  right  court 
is  considered  a  good  return  (except  on  the  service).  The 
posts  are  required  to  stand  outside  ol  the  court,  and  yet 
a  ball  being  returned  at  a  sharp  angle  from  outside  might 
well  be  going  in  and  still  touch  one  of  the  posts. 

Cases  and  Decisions. 

Case  1 — A  bystander  gets  in  the  way  of  a  player  who  fails 

to  return  the  ball.     May  he  then  claim  a  "let"? 

Decision — Yes,  if,  in  the  Umpire's  opinion,  he  was 
prevented  by  an  accident  beyond  his  control.  For 
instance,  if  the  ropes  or  the  seats  are  allowed  to  be 
so  near  to  the  court  that  a  player  is  interefered  with  by 
them,  the  stroke  should  not  be  played  again,  because 
the  ropes  and  seats  form  part  of  the  arrangements  of 
the  ground.  If,  however,  a  spectator  passes  in  front 
of  those  seats,  or  places  a  chair  nearer  than  the  orig- 
inal line,  and  so  interferes  with  a  player,  the  stroke 
should  be  played  again. — James  Dwight. 

Case  2 — A  player  is  interfered  with  as  above,  and  the 
Umpire  directs  the  stroke  to  be  played  again.  The  server 
had  previously  served  a  fault.  He  claims  the  right  to  two 
services. 

Decision — The  fault  stands.    A  "let"  does  not  annul  a 

previous  fault. — James  Dwight. 

Case  3 — A  return  hits  the  Umpire,  or  his  chair  or  stand, 
the  player  claims  that  the  ball  was  going  into  court. 

Decision — Stroke  is  lost. — James  Dwight. 

Case  4 — A  player  serves.  He  hears  the  Umpire  call,  but 
cannot  hear  what  he  says.  He  knows  that  the  only  two 
things  that  the  Umpire  should  call  are  "fault"  and  "let," 
and  that  in  neither  case  can  the  ball  be  in  play.  He, 
therefore,  does  not  return  it,  only  to  find  that  the  Umpire 
has  called  "play."     Has  he  any  redress? 

Decision — Yes.    A  "let"  shall  be  called  and  the  point 

played  over. — James  Dwight. 


294  SPALDING'S    L^WN    TENNIS    ANNDAL, 

LAW  21. 

Case  5 — The  Umpire  calls  "fault,"  and  then  instantly 
changes  and  says  "play."  The  striker-out  fails  to  return 
the  ball,  and  he  claims  he  was  prevented  by  the  Umpire, 
and  also  that  the  Umpire  cannot  change  his  decision. 

Decision — The  Umpire  should  call  a  "let"  and  the  ser- 
vice be  taken  again. — James  Dwight. 

Case  6 — During  play  a  ball  is  thrown  into  court,  and  the 
ball  in  play  strikes  it  or  a  player  steps  on  it.  May  a  "let" 
be  claimed? 

Decision — Yes. — James  Dwight. 

Case  7 — A  drive  strikes  in  court  and  on  the  first  bound 
hits  the  backstop.   As  it  bounds  back,  and  before  it  strikes 
the  ground  again,  the  player  returns  it  into  his  opponent's 
court.     Is  it  a  good  return? 
Decision — ^Yes. 

Scoring.      LAW      On  Cither  player  winning  his  first  stroke, 

22  the  score  is  called  15  for  that  player;  on 
either  player  winning  his  second  stroke,  the  score  is 
called  30  for  that  player;  on  either  player  winning 
his  third  stroke,  the  score  is  called  40  for  that  player; 
and  the  fourth  stroke  won  by  either  player  is  scored 
game  for  that  player,  except  as  follows:  If  both 
players  have  won  three  strokes,  the  score  is  called 
deuce;  and  tRe  next  stroke  won  by  either  player  is 
scored  advantage  for  that  player.  If  the  same  player 
win  the  next  stroke,  he  wins  the  game;  if  he  lose  the 
next  stroke  the  score  returns  to  deuce,  and  so  on  until 
one  player  wins  the  two  strokes  immediately  following 
the  score  of  deuce,  when  game  is  scored  for  that  player. 

Explanation  of  Law  22. 

This  is  the  method  of  scoring  the  points  of  the  game  and 
cannot  be  made  plainer.  Why  the  figures  of  15,  30,  40, 
and  love  for  nothing  are  used,  cannot  be  explained;  but 
these  terms  have  been  used  as  long  as  the  game  has  been 
played  and  seem  to  be  satisfactory. 

LAW      The  player  who  first  wins  six  games  wins 

23  the  set,  except  as  follows:  If  both  players 
win  five  games  the  score  is  called  games-all;  and  the 
next  game  won  by  either  player  is  scored  advantage 
game  for  that  player.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next 
game,  he  wins  the  set;  if  he  lose  the  next  game,  the 


SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL.  295 

LAW  23. 
score  returns  to  games-all;  and  so  on,  until  either 
placer  wins  the  two  games  immediately  following  the 
score  of  games-all,  when  he  wins  the  set.  But  the 
committee  having  charge  of  any  tournament  may  in 
their  discretion  modify  this  rule  by  the  omission  of 
advantage  sets. 

Explanation  of  Law  23. 
This  is  the  method  of  scoring  the  games  in  a  set  and 
seems  to  meet  with  the  full  approval  of  everyone.     The 
law  plainly  states  the  method. 

Cases  and  Decisions. 

Case  1 — The  score  is  five-games-all  and  the  Umpire  directs 
the  players  to  play  an  advantage  set.  The  advantage  game 
has  been  won,  when  it  is  discovered  that  no  advantage 
sets  are  to  be  played.    What  is  to  be  done? 

Decision — The  set  is  won  at  the  eleventh  game.    It  is 
no  part  of  the  Umpire's  duty  to  decide  on  the  condi- 
^  tions  of  the  matches. — James  Dwight. 

Case  2 — A  and  B,  who  started  the  service,  win  the  first 
five  games;  then  C  and  D  win  the  next  three.  A  and  B 
win  the  next  game,  which  makes  the  score  6  to  3.  Do 
A  and  B  win  the  set  at  the  ninth  game  notwithstanding 
C  and  D  have  not  served  as  many  times  as  A  and  B? 

Decision — The  score  of  6  to  3  would  end  the  set 
whether  or  not  C  and  D  served  as  many  times  as 
their  opponents. — R.  D.  Wrenn. 

LAW      The  players  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  when  players

alternate  game  of  each  set  and  at  the  end  of  each  set, 
unless  the  number  of  games  in  such  set  be  even,  in 
which  case  the  change  is  not  made  until  the  end  of  the 
first  game  of  the  next  set.  It  shall,  however,  be  open 
to  the  players  by  mutual  consent  and  notification  to 
the  umpire  before  the  opening  of  the  second  game  of 
the  match  to  change  sides  instead  at  the  end  of  every 
set  until  the  odd  and  concluding  set,  in  which  they 
shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first,  third  and 
every  subsequent  alternate  game  of  such  set. 

Explanation  of  Law  24. 

Tlie  change  of  courts  is  made  after  every  odd  game  of  the 
set,  not  of  the  match.  If  the  total  number  of  games  played 
in  a  set  is  even,  you  play  the  first  game  of  the  next  set  in 


296  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNDAL, 

LAW  24. 

the  same  court  in  which  you  finish  the  preceding  set;  then 
change,  play  two  games  and  change  again,  and  so  on. 
If  the  number  of  games  in  a  set  is  odd,  you  change,  play 
one  and  change  again.    Change  courts  after  the  first  game 
of  each  set. 

The  set  is  considered  the  unit,  not  the  match. 

It  can  be  agreed  before  the  match  starts,  to  change  courts 

only  at  the  end  of  a  set  until  the  odd  and  concluding  set; 

in  this  set  you  change  after  the  odd  game. 

It  is  the  Umpire's  duty  to  direct  the  competitors  to  change 

sides,  in  accordance  with  this  law   (Section  E,  Regulation 

9,  of  Regulations  for  the  Management  of  Tournaments) . 

LAW  In  all  contests  the  play  shall  be  continuous 
*25  from  the  first  service  till  the  match  be  con- 
cluded ;  provided,  however,  that  at  the  end  of  the  third 
set  either  player  is  entitled  to  a  rest,  which  shall  not 
exceed  seven  minutes;  and  provided,  further,  that  in 
case  of  an  unavoidable  accident,  not  within  the  con- 
trol of  the  contestants,  a  cessation  of  play  which  shall 
not  exceed  two  minutes  may  be  allowed;  but  this 
proviso  shall  be  strictly  construed,  and  the  privilege 
never  granted  for  the  purpose  of  allowing  a  player 
to  recover  his  strength  or  wind.  The  referee  in  his 
discretion  may  at  any  time  postpone  the  match  on 
account  of  darkness  or  condition  of  the  ground  or 
weather.  In  any  case  of  postponement,  the  previous 
score  shall  hold  good.  Where  the  play  has  ceased  for 
more  than  an  hour,  the  player  ivho  at  the  cessation 
thereof  was  in  the  court  first  chosen  shall  have  the 
choice  of  courts  on  the  recommencement  of  play.  He 
shall  stay  in  the  court  he  chooses  for  the  remainder 
of  the  set.  The  last  two  sentences  do  not  apply  when 
the  players  change  every  alternate  game,  as  provided 
by  Law  24. 

Explanation  of  Law  25. 

The  seven  minutes'  rest  can  be  taken  only  after  the  third 
set.  It  cannot  be  taken  before  the  third  set  or  at  any 
time  after  the  fourth  set  has  been  started.  It  must  be 
taken  after  the  third  set  or  not  at  all. 


*A1I  matches  in  which  women  take  part  in  tournaments  held 
under  the  auspices  of  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Ten- 
nis Association  shall  be  the  best  two  in  three  sets,  with  a  rest 
not  exceeding  seven  minutes  after  the  second  set. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

LAW  25. 
In  women's  matches,  after  the  second  set  or  not  at  all. 
There  is  no  rest  in  a  two-out-of-three  set  match. 
The  players  must  be  back  on  the  court  seven  minutes 
after  play  has  ceased. 

Should  a  player,  on  account  of  physical  unfitness  or  an 
unavoidable  accident  not  within  his  control,  be  unable  to 
continue  play  after  a  period  of  two  minutes,  he  must  be 
defaulted. 

The  Referee  or  the  Committee  postpones  the  match,  not 
the   Umpire. 

In  case  of  a  postponement,  the  match  is  resumed  from  the 
point,  game  and  set  score  existing  when  the  match  was 
stopped,  unless  it  is  mutually  agreed  between  the  players 
and  the  Referee  to  play  the  entire  match  over. 
If  play  has  been  suspended  for  more  than  an  hour  in  a 
match  where  the  players  are  changing  courts  only  at  the 
end  of  each  set,  when  play  is  resumed  the  player  who  was 
in  the  court,  when  the  match  was  stopped,  that  was  taken 
by  the  player  who  had  choice  of  courts  when  the  match 
was  first  started,  shall  have  the  choice  of  courts  on  the 
recommencement  of  play.  This  does  not  apply  where  the 
players  are  changing  at  the  end  of  the  odd  games  of  the 
match. 

While  there  is  nothing  in  the  rules  that  covers  it,  a  player 
should  not  be  coached  by  a  spectator  and  never  by  a 
Linesman.  It  is  not  good  sportsmanship. 
"Stalling"  is  one  of  the  hardest  things  to  deal  with.  The 
rules  say  that  "the  play  shall  be  continuous."  A  deter- 
mined Umpire  can  nearly  always  apply  the  remedy  if  he 
goes  about  it  right.  He  must  determine  whether  the 
"stalling"  is  deliberate  and  for  the  purpose  of  gaining 
time.  If  he  decides  that  it  is,  he  should  warn  the  player 
to  stop  this  unfair  practice;  if  this  does  not  end  it,  he 
should  then  default  him. 

Rule  22  of  the  Regulations  and  Management  of 
Tournaments  says:  "The  Committee  may,  whether 
appealed  to  by  any  competitor  or  not,  postpone  the 
meeting  or  any  match  or  part  of  a  match  if,  in  their 
opinion,  the  state  of  the  weather,  or  of  the  light,  or 
the  condition  of  the  ground,  or  other  circumstances, 
render  it  advisable  to  do  so.  In  cases  of  postpone- 
ment, Law  25  must  be  strictly  observed.

game  shall  be  delivered  by  the  player  who  did  not 
serve  out  of  his  turn,  and  so  on  in  regular  rotation. 

Explanation  of  Law  26. 

A  point  or  game  that  has  been  played  out  and  finished 
stands,  even  though  the  wrong  player  has  served.  The 
match  goes  on  as  though  no  error  had  been  committed, 
the  player  who  did  not  serve  out  of  turn  serving  next. 

Cases  and   Decisions. 

Case  1 — A  player  serves  a  fault  and  it  is  then  discovered 
that  it  is  his  partner's  service.     Does  the  fault  stand? 
Decision — Yes. — James  Dwight. 

The  foregoing  laws  shall  apply  to  the  three-handed 
and  four-handed  games,  except  as  follows: 

LAW      For     the    three-handed     and     four-handed  Dimensions  of

LAW      In  the  three-handed  game,  the  single  player

Explanation  of  Law  28. 

It  should  be  agreed  before  the  match  is  started  whether 
the  single  player's  court  is  to  be  bounded  by  the  lines  of 
a  doubles  or  singles  court. 

LAW      In  the  four-handed  game,  the  pair  who  have

Both    of    the    opponents    of    the    servers    in    doubles    are

The  formation  of  a  doubles  team  cannot  be  changed  dur-

plain. 

In  doubles,  partners  must  receive  throughout  each  set  on 
the  same  sides  of  the  court  which  they  originally  select 
when  the  set  begins.  The  first  server  is  not  required  to 
receive  in  the  right  court;  he  may  select  either  side  at  the 
beginning  of  the  set,  but  must  hold  this  to  the  end.

Explanation  of  Law  32. 

Should  the  ball  when  served  strike  a  permanent  fixture  of 
the  court  and  drop  into  the  proper  service  court,  it  is  a 
fault;  if  it  touches  the  net  and  falls  into  the  proper  court, 
it  is  a  "let";  if  in  the  iMong  court,  it  is  a  fault. 


LAW      It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  do  not  drop

server's  partner  or  anything  he  wears  or  carries. 

Explanation  of  Law  33. 

It  makes  no  difference  where  the  ball  goes  after  it  touches 
a  player.  If  this  happens  during  a  service,  it  is  a  fault; 
during  a  rally,  the  ball  is  dead  and  th^  player  who  is  hit 
loses  the  point.

Case  1 — The  server's  first  service  strikes  his  partner.  Does 
he  lose  the  stroke  or  is  it  a  fault?

How  to  Lay  Out  a  Tennis  Court 


As    a    double    court    pra     i 
tically  includes  every  line  ti 
be  found  in  a  single  court,  it 
is  best  to  take  first  the  meas 
ure   for    the   latter.      Having 
determined    the    position    of 
your  net,  plant  in  the  ground! 
in  the  line  chosen,  two  pegsl 
27  feet  apart   (at  the  pointbl 
A    and    B    in    the    diagram).] 
Then  take  two  measures  andJ 
attach    their   respective   ends^ 
to    the    pegs   A    and   B.      On' 
the  first,  which  will  measure  i 
the    diagonal    of    the    courti 
take    a    length    of   47    feet    3 
inches  ;  on  the  other  39  feet  |.i. 
pull  both  taut  in  such  direc! 
tions  that  at  these  distance;   i 
they  meet  in  a  point  C    Thif  j 
will   give   one    corner   of   tht  ( 
court.      At  that  point  F,  21 
feet  from  B,  put  in  a  peg  to  mark  the  end  of  the  service-line.     The  other  corner,  j 
D,  and  the  other  end  of  the  service-line  G,  may   be  found  by  interchanging  the 
measures  and  repeating  the  process.     The  same  measurements  on  the  other  side  ] 
of   the  net   will   complete   the   exterior    boundaries   of   the   court.     By   prolonging  j 
the  base-line  4  foot  G  inches  in  each  direction,   and  joining  the  four  new  point?  | 
thus  obtained,  we  can  make  the  side-lines  of  a  double  court.     It  only  remains  tc  ' 
mark  the  central   line.      This  j 

is  done  by  joining  the  middle  SideXine   ?    78  feet  1 

points  of  the  service-lines.  If 
a  double  court  alone  be  re- 
quired, the  interiov  side-lines 
need  not  be  prolonged  to 
meet  the  base-lines.  Remem- 
ber that  in  all  cases  the  net- 
posts  must  stand  at  a  dis- 
tance of  three  feet  from  the 
side-lines. 

For  a  court  where  a  single 
or  double  game  can  be  played, 
the  size  is  78  feet  in  length 
by  ?.fi  in  width.  4%  feet  in- 
side the  side  lines,  and  paral- 
lel with  them  are  drawn  the 
service  lines.

How  to  Build  and  Keep  a  Court 

Nothing  is  more  important  for  the  full  enjoyment  of  lawn  tennis 
than  a  satisfactory  court,  and  none  of  the  other  accessories  of  the 
game  offers  a  wider  variety.  Many  important  considerations  come  up 
even  after  the  kind  of  court  to  be  built,  and  the  cost,  have  been  de- 
cided upon.  No  matter  how  much  is  to  be  spent  on  the  ground,  nor 
what  the  surface  is  to  be,  the  most  important  things  to  consider  first 
are  space,  light  and  drainage. 

The  back-stop  nettings  should  never  be  nearer  than  fifteen  feet  to 
the  lines,  and  if  good  players  are  expected  to  use  the  court,  particu- 
larly if  tournament  matches  are  to  take  place  on  it,  the  space  behind 
the  base-line  should  be  21  feet  at  each  end.  At  the  sides  at  least 
6  feet,  if  possible  12  feet  should  be  allowed  beyond  the  side-lines  for 
doubles  of  each  court.  A  well-appointed  court  for  tournament  play 
should  be  centered  in  an  unobstructed  space  of  not  less  than  60  x  120 
feet.  Wire  back-stop  netting  10  or  12  feet  high  should  surround  it 
at  these  distances  from  the  lines.  If  there  are  two  or  more  courts 
together,  there  should  be  at  least  12  feet  between  their  side  lines,  and 
one   netting  can  surround  all. 

In  selecting  a  site  for  a  court,  a  spot  should  be  chosen  where  there 
is  always  plenty  of  sunlight,  and  where  at  no  time  of  the  day  does 
any  shadow  cross  the  ground  on  which  the  court  is  to  be  laid.  Green 
or  black  is  a  preferable  background  to  play  against,  but  any  dark  and 
even  color  will  do.  A  court  should  never  be  laid  out  with  any  very 
light  background  within  a  short  distance  at  either  end,  or  close  at 
either  side.  Nor  should  a  site  be  selected  with  a  badly  mixed  or 
moving  background.  Shade  trees  are  useful  near  a  court,  only  if  their 
shadow  is  a  solid  one,  not  constantly  checkered  by  flecks  of  sunlight 
glittering  through  moving  branches,  which  constantly  confuse  the 
players.  Never  should  tliey  be  allowed  near  enough  to  cast  any 
shadows  on  the  playing  surface. 

One  more  cardinal  point  should  be  remembered.  The  court  should 
invariably  be  laid  out  north  and  south — never  east  and  west.  If  this 
warning  is  disregarded,  the  player  at  one  end  or  the  other  will  be  hope- 
lessly blinded  by  the  sun. 

The  question  of  drainage  is  one  of  the  most  important  considerations 
in  selecting  a  site  of  this  kind.  On  the  natural  facilities  depends 
largely  the  cost  of  laying  out  a  good  court.  If  the  natural  soil  be 
sandy  and  well  drained,  or  if  it  is  on  high  ground  which  slopes  away 
near  by,  artificial  drain  pipes  will  not  have  to  be  put  in,  and  this 
saves  much  of  the  cost,  but  if  it  be  thick  clay  that  holds  moisture  long, 
or  on  low  ground  with  neighboring  slopes  that  drain  toward  it,  the 
court  will  he  useless  for  many  hours  after  each  rainfall  unless  artificial 
drain-pipes  are  put  in. 

After  the  site  has  been  selected,  it  must  be  decided  whether  a  grass 
or  ''dirt"  court  is  to  be  built.  If  the  natural  sod  is  luxuriant  and  the 
soil  favorable  for  its  growth,  or  if  the  court  is  not  to  be  used  enough 
to  wear  off  the  grass,  a  turf  court  will  generally  be  found  preferable, 
but  if  the  ground  is  to  be  constantly  in  use,  the  sod  will  wear  off  and 
become  "bald"  unless  there  is  space  enough  on  the  lawn  to  shift  the 
court  frequently. 

When  good  turf  cannot  be  had  or  will  not  stand  the  wear,  a  substi- 
tute muet  be  found,  and  sand  or  dirt  courts  are  most  often  used. 
On  well-drained  land,  one  can  sometimes  cut  away  the  top  surface, 
level  the  ground  and  roll  it  until  well  hardened  and  the  court  is  ready 
for  use,  but  more  preparation  is  necessary  to  build  a  permanent  court 
that  will  not  be  constantly  losing  its  proper  level. 

For  such  a  court  the  earth  should  be  cut  away  to  a  depth  of  on« 
foot  if  no  drains  are  required.  After  leveling  it  carefully  with  a  spirit- 
level,  to  be  sure  that  the  grade  is  right,  a  layer  of  six  inches  of  brokea 
stone  should  first  be  laid  and  pounded  down  hard.  Ordinary  trap-rock 
used  for  macadamizing  roads  is  perhaps  the  best  for  this  purpose,  but 
any  broken  stone,  ranging  in  sizes  from  a  walnut  to  an  egg,  will  answer 


304  SexLDiyGi,    LAW^.     TEXNIS    AXXrA'.. 

the  pLffpose.  This  should  be  covered  with  a  three-inch  larer  of  coarse 
gravel  or  fine  broken  stone,  which  should  be  thoroughly  "pounded  and 
watered  for  several  days  before  being  covered.  Before  any  surface  is 
put  on  tile  court,  the  greatest  care  should  be  taken  to  see  that  the 
foundation  is  perfectly  level.  Any  holes  or  depressions  that  appear 
from  rolling  and  pounding  should  be  filled  in  before  it  is  covered. 

Every  well  built  court  should  be  graded  either  from  end  to  end  or 
from  side  to  side  to  an  extent  of  not  over  two  inches,  which  will 
suffice  to  drain  off  rain  water.  If  artificial  drainage  is  necessarv  to 
keep  the  court  dry,  drain  pipes  can  be  laid  in  the  foundations  of  the 
court  about  three  feet  outside  the  side  and  end  lines,  care  being 
taken  whereby  the  pipes  will  tilt,  following  the  grade  of  the  court  a» 
far  as  possible,  thus  allowing  the  water  to  run  off.  The  best  drain 
pipes  are  sis-inch  stone  sewer  pipe,  cut  in  halves,  or  stone  gutters 
used  on  tiled  roofs,  which  should  be  sunk  in  the  ground  immediately 
under  the  foundation  of  broken  rock  and  filled  with  pebbles  or  fine 
cracked  stone. 

The  covering  for  a  gravel  or  sand  court  should  be  not  less  than 
three  nor  more  than  six  inches  in  thickness,  and  of  sandy  loam  and 
clay  mixed.  The  proportions  depend  on  the  quality  of  the  "clay.  If  it 
is  very  binding  and  sticky,  one  part  of  sand  to  four  of  clay  are  pref- 
erable, but  for  the  average  ingredients  they  should  be  mixed  about 
eight  parts  of  clay  to  one  part  of  sand.  When  the  court  is  finished,  if 
it  is  found  to  be  too  soft  but  dry,  more  clay  should  be  added  :  while  if 
It  drains  poorly  and  stays  muddy  too  long  after  rain,  or  its  surface  Ib 
too  sticky  for  the  player's  feet,  more  sand  should  be  added  on  the 
surface.  When  a  court  is  finally  covered,  it  should  be  thoroughly 
Watered  and  rolled  alternately  twi"ce  every  day  for  two  weeks  before  it 
Is  played  on  at  all,  and  any  "depressions  "or  uneven  spots  corrected  as 
fast  as  they  appear  from  the  settling.  Aft^  the  first  heavy  rain 
itorm  it  should  be  gone  over  and  releveled  most  carefully,  for  then 
it  is  most  likely  to  develop  new  faults. 

The  fine  seashore  sand  will  seldom  be  found  satisfactory  for  the 
Kurface  of  a  court,  for  it  works  loose  too  quickly  under  tbe  players' 
feet,  and  can  only  be  made  to  bind  when  mixed  with  a  larger  propor- 
tion of  clay,  which  will  make  the  drainage  more  difficult,  as  water 
percolates  very  slowly  through  clay.  If  the  soil  upon  which  a  court 
is  being  built  is  very"  rich  and  worms  promise  to  work  through  to  the 
surface  above  and  injure  the  court,  it  is  well  to  lay  a  layer  of  fine 
cinders,  those  from  a  railroad  engine  preferred,  between  the  foundation 
and  the  sandy  surface  layer.  These  cinders  effectually  prevent  worms 
from  coming  through  to"  the  surface.  It  is  also  well  to  use  coarse 
eifted  ashes  mixed  with  the  stones  in  the  drain-pipes. 

The  construction  of  a  grass  court  is  less  difficult,  but  varies  much 
more  in  process.  If  cost  need  not  be  considered,  it  should  be  built 
by  an  expert,  and  will  be  laid  on  deep-laid  foundations ;  if  it  is 
desired  to  build  an  economical  court  on  an  available  lawn  which  is 
fairly  level,  the  cost  will  not  be  heavy.  The  sod  should  first  be  care- 
fully removed  in  squares  of  about  eighteen  inches,  from  a  space  at  least 
50  by  100  feet,  cutting  down  to  a  depth  of  about  six  inches.  The 
ground  should  then  be  turned  with  a  spade  to  a  depth  of  eighteen 
Inches  or  two  feet,  and  after  all  stones  have  been  removed,  and  the 
earth  carefully  raked  over  and  leveled,  it  should  be  packed  and  rolled 
with  a  heavy  roller.  It  cannot  have  too  much  leveling  and  rolling, 
and  the  rolling  shoald  be  kept  up  for  several  days  with  plenty  of 
soaking  by  rain  or  hose-pipe.  Any  inequalities  which  the  heavy  pres- 
sure of  the  roller  produces  should  be  filled  in  or  cut  down  before  the 
Bods  are  relaid. 

After  the  ground  has  been  rolled  sufficiently  the  sods  should  be 
replaced.  In  doing  this  it  is  important  to  get  the  edges  close  together, 
BO  that  no  seams  or  open  cracks  can  be  found.  These  sods  should  be 
relaid  in  the  afternoon  and  well  drenched  with  water.  The  next  day 
the  ground  should  be  rolled  again :  and  this  should  be  followed  by 
niternate  drenching  and  rolling  for  several  days.  Even  when  the 
ground  finally  appears  firm  and  level,  the  court  should  not  be  played 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  305 

apoD  until  new  blades  of  grass  appear  in  considerable  numbers.  If 
depressions  appear,  the  sod  at  tliat  spot  should  be  lifted,  fresh  earth 
Inserted  to  the  proper  grade  and  the  sod  replaced,  watered  and  rolled 
till  level  and  flat  again. 

Bad  spots  are  often  found  where  the  grass  is  thin  or  where  malignant 
weeds  obstruct  its  growth,  and  in  this  case  fresh  sods  should  be 
bought  or  cut  elsewhere  and  substituted.  Sometimes  large  patches  of 
ground  must  be  renewed  in  this  way,  but  it  wUl  be  found  much  less 
expensive  if  all  the  turf  is  bad  to  sow  the  new  court  down  with  lawn 
seeds,  and  seeds  will  often  help  out  thin  spots  in  the  grass  if  the 
court  is  not  to  be  used  too  soon  after  the  sowing.  It  is  better  to  make 
a  grass  court  in  the  fall  whether  it  is  to  be  sown  with  seed  or  sodded. 
The  winter  storms  will  then  settle  it  thoroughly,  and  after  a  little 
releveling  in  the  spring  it  will  be  ready  for  use. 

Grass  seeds  should  be  sown  between  the  middle  of  March  and  the 
first  of  May,  or  better  yet,  in  the  autumn,  between  the  middle  of 
August  and  the  first  of  October.  It  takes  about  20  pecks  of  good 
lawn  seed  to  cover  a  space  60  by  120  feet.  The  sowing  should  be 
gone  over  twice,  the  second  time  at  right  angles  to  the  first.  Clover 
seeds  should  be  avoided,  as  this  grass  does  not  wear  well,  and  guano 
should  not  be  used  for  fertilizing,  for  it  tends  to  bring  up  coarse  blades 
in  patches. 

As  soon  as  the  young  grass  is  high  enough  to  be  topped,  a  scythe  or 
sickle  should  be  used,  being  at  first  better  than  the  mowing  macbina. 
After  the  new  grass  is  well  hardened,  however,  the  latter  should  be 
constantly  in  use,  never  less  than  once  a  week,  and  in  moist  warm 
weather  nearly  every  day.  With  every  precaution  weeds  are  sure  to 
appear,  but  these  can  generally  be  held  in  check  by  constant  mowing. 
ITie  more  formidable  weeds,  however,  must  be  cut  with  a  knife  one  by 
one  about  an  inch  below  the  surface,  and  care  being  taken  to  remove 
as  much  of  the  root  as  possible.  A  pinch  of  salt  dropped  on  the  cut 
root  will  generally  stop  the  growth.  When  the  turf  becomes  worn  in 
spots  a  small  shift  in  the  lines  of  the  court  will  relieve  the  pressure 
and  enable  the  grass  to  grow  again  ;  at  the  end  of  the  season  all  of 
the  bare  patches  should  be  resown. 

Once  the  court  is  finally  built  and  ready  for  use,  it  must  be  properly 
marked  out.  In  every  case,  unless  it  be  of  grass,  and  the  lines  are 
to  be  constantly  shitted  to  prevent  bare  spots,  net-posts  should  be 
permanently  sunk  in  the  ground.  They  should  be  not  less  than  two 
feet  under  the  ground  nor  less  t-han  forty  feet  apart. 

A  good  dirt  court  should  be  swept,  watered,  rolled  and  freshly 
marked  out  after  every  eight  or  ten  sets  of  play,  and  oftener  in  very 
dry  weather.  Instantly  a  depression  is  discovered  it  should  be  filled 
In  and  rolled  down  before  playing  is  continued,  for  it  is  almost  aa 
dangerous  for  the  players  as  the  court  to  continue  with  it  uneven. 
A  court  should  never  be  rolled  in  the  condition  the  players  leave  it 
after  play,  A  player's  heel  raises  a  little  lump  :  if  the  roller  goes  over 
this  before  it  is  swept  down  even  again,  a  hard  ridge  results  and  the 
ball  will  bound  imevenly  from  it.  It  should  be  swept  over  first,  until 
all  the  lumps  are  leveled  down,  before  the  roller  is  allowed  on  its 
surface. 

One  of  the  best  sweepers  is  made  of  a  heavy  joist  of  wood  with  a 
dozen  thicknesses  of  old  jute  bagging  or  coarse  "cloth  frayed  out  at  the 
bottom  edges,  fastened  to  its  bottom  and  trailing  on  behind  it.  This 
should  be  drawTi  over  the  court  with  a  handle  or  rope  several  times. 
If  it  is  pushed,  the  groundsman's  feet  will  leave  tracks  after  it :  if  he 
goes  ahead  the  sweeper  will  erase  them.  Before  the  lines  are  marked 
out  fresh,  the  old  ones  should  always  be  swept  off  with  a  broom,  bat 
if  the  broom  is  constantly  used  along  the  lines  in  a  parallel  direction. 
It  will  gradually  wear  away  little  grooves  in  the  court  where  the  lines 
are  and  the  halls  will  bound  improperly  from  them.  The  sweeping 
should  be  done  lightly  across  the  court,  at  right  angles  with  the 
lines. 

A  grass  court  cannot  have  too  much  care.  It  is  advisable  to  wet  it 
thoroughly  several  times  a  week  and  roll  it  as  often.     It  shonld  ba

watered  at  night,  cut  in  the  morning,  and  rolled  after  cutting  and 
before  watering.  The  best  way  to  repair  a  bare  strip  of  ground  is  to 
lay  fresh  turf,  and  this  should  be  done  in  the  fall  or  as  early  as  pos- 
sible in  the  spring.  Good  tough  turf,  laid  in  February  or  early  m 
March,  will  be  fit  for  use  by  the  first  of  June.  In  the  early  spring 
grass  roots  both  in  new  turf  and  old  may  be  greatly  benefited  by  a 
good  dressing  of  manure  well  worked  in,  but  regular  manuring  should 
also  be  done  in  the  fall. 

Worm  casts  are  very  bad  for  good  tennis  turf.  Particularly  In 
fertile  ground  or  after  a  storm,  the  little  mounds  will  appear  on  the 
BOd,  and  if  the  roller  passes  over  them  or  they  are  trodden  down  little 
hard  lumps  are  formed  which  spoil  the  surface  of  the  court.  The  turf 
should  always  be  swept  before  rolling,  and  in  rich  soil  every  morning. 
This  scatters  the  mounds  effectually.  Where  it  is  necessary  to  get 
rid  of  the  worms,  lime  water  should  be  sprinkled  on  the  ground.  They 
will  then  come  to  the  surface  and  can  be  swept  away. 

When  a  horse  mowing  machine  is  used  it  is  well  to  have  the  horse's 
hoofs  covered  with  soft  pads  to  prevent  their  cutting  into  the  turf 
and  leaving  prints  that  affect  the  bound  of  the  ball.  The  groundsman 
at  work  on  good  lawn  tennis  courts,  particularly  when  the  turf  Is 
softs  and  always  on  a  sand  court,  should  be  required  to  wear  rubber- 
Boled  shoes  without  heels. 

Of  the  various  other  kinds  of  courts,  namely,  asphalt,  concrete, 
cinder,  etc.,  the  asphalt  is  probably  the  better  type. 

The  asphalt  court  is  very  hard  and  fast,  giving  the  ball  a  much  higher 
bound  than  any  clay  or  gravel  court.  Hence  it  has  placed  an  additional 
premium  on  swift  serving,  smashing  and  volleying.  Aggressiveness — 
that  quality  which  is  absolutely  essential  for  first  string  champions — 
has  therefore  become  part  and  parcel  of  the  game  in  California. 
Asphalt  makes  the  attacking  game  imperative. 

Although  the  asphalt  court  lacks  many  of  the  attractions  of  the 
best  turf  and  clay  courts  (being  so  very  hard),  it  has  its  advantages. 
If  it  is  properly  constructed,  the  cost  of  its  upkeep  is  practically  nil 
compared  to  others.  Aside  from  freshening  up  the  lines  with  paint 
once  a  year  and  sweeping  it  free  from  dust  and  litter  occasionally, 
there  is  no  expense  of  cash  or  effort  necessary.  Then,  too,  it  can  be 
dried  with  brooms  and  mops  within  an  hour  or  less  after  the  hardest 
rain.  In  Eastern  climates  snow  could  readily  be  shoveled  and  swept 
off,  and  the  spring  thaw  would  never  feaze  it.  Furthermore,  the 
asphaltum  surface  is  perfectly  true.  No  bad  bounds,  except  on  ancient 
and  poorly  built  courts. 

The  Fay  Improvement  Company  of  San  Francisco,  the  leading  court 
builders  on  the  Coast,  have  kindly  supplied  the  following  specifications 
for  the  benefit  of  those  who  wish  to  install  asphalt  courts  : 

"The  area  of  the  court  should  be  60  x  120  feet.  The  ground  should 
be  graded  so  as  to  have  a  pitch  of  at  least  9  inches  In  120  feet  without 
any  crown  whatsoever.  The  subgrade  should  be  either  rolled  with  a 
small  steam  roller  weighing  two  and  one-half  tons,  or  with  heavy  hand 
rollers.  Upon  your  subgrade  place  four  inches  of  concrete,  or  if  yon 
can  obtain  good  bedrock  macadam,  six  inches  of  that  will  serve  instead. 
Upon  this,  spread  one  inch  of  asphalt  wearing  surface,  which  should 
be  made  of  the  following  proportions  :  Asphalt  having  a  penetration 
of  70  to  90  degrees,  120  pounds  ;  powdered  limestone  or  cement,  150 
pounds ;  fine  sand,  possessing  not  over  three  per  cent  loam  or  mica, 
745  pounds.  The  foregoing  quantities  constitute  nine  cubic  feet  of 
finishing  material,  covering  an  area  of  one  hundred  feet  square  and  one 
Inch  thick.  Particular  pains  should  be  taken  in  ironing  and  hand 
rolling  of  the  asphalt  so  that  there  will  be  no  roughness  after  the  final 
rolling.  There  should  be  two  hand  rollers  used  when  the  asphalt  is 
Bpread,  one  weighing  about  600  pounds,  followed  by  a  lighter  one 
weighing  close  to  400  pounds.  The  rakers  should  work  to  a  three- 
quarter  inch  surface  board  in  spreading  the  material.  Should  the  sub- 
grade  be  all  loam  or  material  that  opens  up  and  cracks,  It  would  be 
good  to  spread  about  two  inches  of  sand  before  the  concrete  base  or 
macadam  is  laid." 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  307 

Concrete  courts  should  be  laid  in  blocks,  and  hare  a  possible  advan- 
tage over  asphalt  In  a  very  hot  climate,  as  they  will  not  get  soft  and 
spongy.  The  building  of  a  concrete  court  should  in  most  cases  be  left 
to  a  first-class  contractor. 

Cinder  courts  are  cheap  and  easy  to  construct,  but  have  the  disad- 
vantage of  being  very  dirty. 

In  regard  to  wood  courts,  which  are  becoming  quite  popular,  the  best 
plan  to  follow  would  be  to  consult  an  expert  court  builder.  Hemlock 
and  Louisiana  cypress  are  usually  the  two  best  kinds  of  wood  to  oae 
The  life  of  a  wood  court  is  usually  from  five  to  ten  years. 


BOARD  COURTS. 


In  regard  to  board  courts,  it  is  in  the  first  place  essential  that  they 
should  be  firm  and  yet  springy  and  made  as  near  the  ground,  if  out 
of  doors  (which  seems  to  be  the  popular  method  at  the  present  time), 
as  possible.  The  foundation  of  a  wooden  court  should  be  of  heavy 
beams,  .sutficiently  so  to  prevent  all  bending  or  giving.  The  boai'ds 
laid  on  same  should  be  not  less  than  li/.  inch  in  thickness  in  order 
to  obtain  the  best  results,  and  if  a  wooden  playing  surface  is  desired, 
the  boards  should  be  laid  Vs  inch  apart,  which  will  permit  rapid 
drainage,  and  after  having  been  laid,  same  should  be  painted  green 
with  white  marking  lines.  The  best  playing  surface  is  secured  by 
having  a  flap  of  heavy  canvas  made  by  a  sailmaker,  which  will  b« 
of  sufficient  size  to  not  onl.v  cover  the  court,  but  also  extend  at  least 
10  feet  outside  the  boundaries  of  same.  This  canvas  should  be 
stretched  by  method  of  rope  passing  through  eyi^Iets,  with  pulleys  at 
each  corner  of  the  court,  by  means  of  which  the  rope  can  be  con- 
stantly kept  tight.  After  the  canvas  has  been  laid  and  properly 
stretched,  it  should  be  painted  a  grass  green,  upon  which  white  mark- 
ing lines  1%  inch  in  width  can  be  made.  A  canvas  covering  such 
as  this  is  of  some  considerable  expense,  but  with  proper  care,  that  is, 
painting  same  sufficiently  often  during  the  winter  season  and  storing 
same  carefully  during  the  hot  mouths,  it  should  last  for  some  years. 
Wooden  courts  for  inside  play,  that  is.  covered  courts,  should  be  laid 
whenever  possible  on  wooden  beams,  so  as  to  get  some  slight  spring, 
and  not  on  iron  or  concrete,  which  will  render  them  so  dead  as  to 
make  it  exceedingly  hard  for  the  players'  feet.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

The  New  Spalding  "Official"  Two-Piece 
Tennis  Bali 

Tennis  players  for  many  years  have  realized  that  the  balls  in  use  had  certain 
mechanical  defects  which  seemed  unsurmountable,  especially  as  the  work  on  the 
balls,  to  a  great  extent,  was  done  by  hand  and  .therefore  subject  to  all  the  varia- 
tions to  which  the  human  element  is  susceptible. 

The  old  method  necessitated  the  sticking  onto  the  wall  of  the  ball  of  a  plug 
or  valve.  This  plug  was  put  on  to  the  ball  to  permit  of  an  air  needle  being 
inserted  through  it,  and  the  ball  itself  inflated  after  moulding.  Very  often  ihi^ 
needle  hole  leaked  slowly  and  the  ball  gradually  lost  its  life.  Occasionally, 
also,  in  spite  of  careful  manipulation,  the  plugs  became  loosened  and  the  ball 
would  rattle  and  quickly  deflate. 

It  is  with  great  pleasure  therefore  that  A.  G.  Spalding  &  Bros,  have  announced 
that  at  last,  after  much  experimenting,  they  have  been  able  to  manufacture  a 
tennis  ball  which  eliminates  the  troubles  that  have  beset  players  for  so  long. 
In  the  first  place,  instead  of  the  old  method  of  making  the  ball  in  four  pieces, 
the  new  ball  is  a  two-piece  affair.  The  work  is  exclusively  done  by  machine, 
the  result  being  that  one  ball  is  precisely  like  another,  even  the  walls  not  vary- 
ing a  thousandth  of  an  inch.  These  two  pieces  are  put  together  automatically 
and  the  ball  inflated  in  the  process  before  being  vulcanized.  This  process 
necessitates  only  one  seam  and  eliminates  the  crude  overlapping  seams  of  the 
old  method.  The  cover,  which  is  made  of  the  finest  Australian  wool,  is  cemented 
and  sewn  on,  giving  permanent  adhesion,  which,  together  with  the  evenness  of 
the  wall,  assures  perfect  flight  and  bound. 

It  needs  no  argument  to  show  that  the  plug  makes  an  unbalanced  ball,  whi 
on  the  contrary,  in  the  two-piece  ball,  there  is  perfect  uniformity  and  perfe 
balance. 

It  is  the  "evc-yday"  player  who  is  the  backbone  of  tennis  in  America. 
Often  tennis  ii  his  sole  means  of  recreation.  With  the  Spalding  two-p.'ece  ball 
he  will  obtain  greater  acciracy  with  less  effort,  while  its  durability  will  be  an 
important  factor  in  lessening  frequency  of  replacement — emphasizing  the 
economy  of  quality. 

Scientific  tests,  supplemented  by  use  in  actual  contests,  have  proven  the 
remarkable  qualities  of  the  Spalding  two-piece  ball,  and  it  will  undoubtedly 
effect  as  much  an  improvement  in  tennis  as  the  Spalding  cork  center  ball  has 
done  for  base  ball  and  similar  Spalding  achievements  in  golf  ball  construction. 

Aside  from  the  improved  methods  of  manufacture,  an  important  feature  of 
the  Spalding  two-piece  ball  will  be  the  facility  for  supplying  fresh  balls  through 
the  medium  of  the  Spalding  stores  and  dealers  located  at  all  central  points 
throughout  the  United  States.  Instead  of  making  the  balls  in  a  batch  months 
ahead,  by  the  Spalding  system  of  organization  the  factory  is  enabled  to  parallel 
the  demand  from  any  portion  of  the  United  States,  with  the  assurance  to  the 
player  that  he  will  receive  fresh  balls  throughout  the  season.
