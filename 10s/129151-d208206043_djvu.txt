AMENDMENT  AND  RATIFICATION  OF  OIL.  GAS  AND  MINERAL  LEASE 


THE  STATE  OF  TEXAS  § 

§  KNOW  ALL  MEN  BY  THESE  PRESENTS: 

COUNTY  OF  TARRANT  § 

This  AMENDMENT  AND  RATIFICATION  OF  OIL,  GAS  AND  MINERAL  LEASE  is 
executed  by  David  Reas,  husband,  and  Pamela  K  Warriner  Reas,  to  be  effective  as  of  March  15, 
2008. 

WITNESSETH: 

Whereas,  David  Reas,  husband,  and  Pamela  K  Warriner  Reas,  as  Lessor,  executed  and 
delivered  unto  Axia  Land  Services,  L.L.C.,  as  Lessee,  that  certain  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Lease 
(the  "Lease"),  dated  March  15, 2008,  and  recorded  in  Instrument  No.  D208127192  of  the  Official 
Records  of  Tarrant  County,  Texas;  and 

Whereas,  at  the  time  the  Lease  was  entered  into,  the  description  of  the  lands  contained  in 
the  Lease  was  believed  by  Lessor  and  Lessee  to  cover,  and  was  intended  to  cover,  certain  lands 
owned  by  Lessor;  and 

Whereas,  since  the  execution,  delivery,  and  recording  of  the  Lease,  it  has  been  discovered 
that  the  description  of  lands  contained  in  the  Lease  does  not  adequately  describe  the  lands  Lessor 
intended  to  lease  to  Lessee.  Lessor  and  Lessee  desire  to  amend  and  correct  the  description  of 
lands  contained  in  the  Lease  to  accurately  identify  the  lands  to  be  covered  by  the  Lease,  and  to 
ratify  and  confirm  the  Lease,  as  amended. 

Now,  Therefore,  for  good  and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and  sufficiency  of 
which  are  hereby  acknowledged  by  Lessor,  the  undersigned  Lessor  does  hereby  amend  the  Lease 
as  follows: 

The  description  of  the  lands  covered  by  the  following  Tracts  is  deleted  in  its  entirety  and 
the  following  description  shall  be  substituted  in  its  place: 

Lot(s)  2,  Block  4,  THE  OAKS,  FOURTH  INSTALLMENT,  Addition  to  the  City  of 
Arlington,  Tarrant  County,  Texas,  according  to  the  Plat  recorded  in  Volume  388-Thirty- 
five.  Page  81 ,  Deed  Records,  Tarrant  County,  Texas. 

Lessor  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  Lease  is  amended  insofar  and  only  insofar  as  it 
pertains  to  the  above  referenced  Tracts.  Lessor  ratifies,  adopts,  and  confirms  the  Lease  and 
extends  the  Lease  to  cover  the  lands  described  in  this  Amendment  and  Ratification  of  Oil,  Gas 
and  Mineral  Lease,  as  if  the  description  of  lands  set  out  above  had  been  originally  included  in  the 
Lease. 


In  the  event  of  a  conflict  between  the  provisions  contained  in  this  instrument  and  any 
other  provisions  contained  in  the  Lease,  the  provisions  contained  in  this  instrument  shall  prevail 
to  the  extent  of  such  conflict;  in  ail  other  respects  the  Lease  shall  remain  in  full  force  and  effect. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  for  good  and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and  sufficiency  of 
which  is  hereby  acknowledged,  the  undersigned  Lessor  does  hereby  agree  and  declare  that  the 
Lease,  as  amended  herein,  is  binding  upon  the  undersigned  Lessor  and  is  and  is  a  valid  and 
subsisting  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Lease.  For  the  same  consideration  recited  above,  the 
undersigned  Lessor  does  hereby  adopt,  ratify  and  confirm  the  Lease,  as  amended  herein,  and  does 
hereby  lease,  let  and  demise  to  the  Lessee  the  lands  described  in  the  Lease,  as  amended  herein, 
subject  to  and  in  accordance  with  all  of  the  terms  and  provisions  of  said  Lease,  as  amended 
herein. 

This  Amendment  and  Ratification  of  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Lease  shall  be  binding  upon  the 
undersigned  and  their  respective  successors  and  assigns. 

This  Amendment  and  Ratification  of  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Lease  is  executed  as  of  the  date  of 
acknowledgment  of  signature  below,  but  shall  be  deemed  effective  for  all  purposes  as  of  March
