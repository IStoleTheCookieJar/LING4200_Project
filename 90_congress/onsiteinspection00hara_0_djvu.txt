For  the  past  decade  Europe  has  been  in  transformation.  For  more  than  four  decades  the  Euro¬ 
pean  continent  had  been  divided  into  two  heavily  armed  military  alliances.  That  sharp  division  soft¬ 
ened  after  1986,  as  old  forms  of  government  were  cast  off  and  new  nations  emerged.  Within  a  few 
years,  across  the  length  and  breadth  of  Europe  from  the  Atlantic  to  the  Urals,  nations  assumed  new 
responsibilities  and  rights  under  a  series  of  new  treaties,  agreements,  and  international  accords.  The 
Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe  (CFE)  Treaty  played  a  pivotal  role  in  this  transformation.  This 
history  details  the  implementation  of  the  CFE  Treaty.  In  doing  so,  it  contributes  to  our  understanding 
of  contemporary  Europe. 

In  the  American  constitutional  system,  the  government  is  accountable  to  its  people.  This  his¬ 
tory,  the  second  in  a  series  by  agency  historians,  tells  the  American  people  about  a  significant  treaty 
mission  undertaken  by  their  national  government.  It  is  based  on  extensive  research  in  government 
documents,  treaty  records,  inspector  and  escort  interviews,  and  statistical  reports.  The  result  is  an 
interesting  history,  one  that  will  be  used  in  treaty  courses  and  disseminated  widely  to  the  public  and 
national  agencies  throughout  Europe  and  the  United  States.  We  hope  that  you  will  enjoy  reading  and 
learning  how  the  United  States  conducted  “On-Site  Inspections  Under  the  CFE  Treaty.”

Joseph  P.  Harahan  is  the  senior  historian  at  the  On-Site  Inspection  Agency.  Prior  to  joining  the 
Agency,  he  was  a  historian  in  the  Office  of  Air  Force  History  and  a  faculty  member  at  the  University 
of  Richmond  and  Michigan  State  University.  He  received  a  B.A.  from  the  University  of  Virginia,  an 
M.A.  from  the  University  of  Richmond,  and  a  Ph.D.  from  Michigan  State  University.  He  is  the  author 
of  On-Site  Inspections  Under  the  INF  Treaty  (1993)  and  the  co-editor  of  a  multivolume  Air  Force 
history  series,  Warrior  Studies  (12  volumes).  While  completing  this  history  he  lectured  at  colleges, 
universities,  and  military  academies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad. 

John  C.  Kuhn,  III,  joined  the  On-Site  Inspection  Agency  in  1992.  As  an  Air  Force  historian,  he 
authored  organizational  histories  at  the  2nd  Bombardment  Wing  and  contributed  to  the  annual  histo¬ 
ries  at  the  8th  and  15th  Air  Forces  in  the  Strategic  Air  Command.  At  the  On-Site  Inspection  Agency 
he  assisted  in  the  final  stages  of  production  of  the  Agency’s  first  history,  On-Site  Inspections  Under 
the  INF  Treaty  (1993)  before  turning  to  researching  and  writing  this  book.

When  the  Cold  War  ended  suddenly  in  1989-90,  the  signposts  were  clearly  visible.  Communist 
governments  collapsed  in  Poland,  Hungary,  Czechoslovakia,  the  German  Democratic  Republic,  Ro¬ 
mania,  and  Bulgaria.  The  Berlin  Wall  fell  in  November  1989.  Germany  was  unified  in  October  1990. 
In  the  same  period,  the  Soviet  Union  announced  that  it  would  withdraw,  within  four  years,  all  of  its 
680,000  stationed  troops  from  Eastern  Europe.  The  United  States  countered  by  declaring  major 
withdrawals  of  its  forces  from  Western  Europe.  Against  this  background  of  political  revolution, 
unification,  and  massive  military  force  withdrawals,  the  leaders  of  Europe,  Canada,  the  United  States, 
and  the  Soviet  Union  signed  the  Peace  of  Paris  in  November  1990.  Two  multinational  agreements 
constituted  the  heart  of  that  peace:  the  Accords  for  the  Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in 
Europe  (CSCE)  and  the  Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe  (CFE)  Treaty. 

Following  national  ratification,  the  CFE  Treaty  entered  into  force  in  July  1992.  By  then  the 
Soviet  Union  had  collapsed  as  an  empire  and  eight  new  republics  had  emerged  to  become  treaty 
signatory  states.  In  all,  30  Atlantic-Eurasian  states  implemented  the  CFE  Treaty.  On-site  inspection 
played  a  critical  role  in  monitoring  treaty  compliance.  Every  treaty  state  established  new,  or  ex¬ 
panded  existing,  verification  agencies  and  staffs  to  conduct  and  host  on-site  inspections.  This  history 
narrates  the  efforts  by  the  United  States  and  other  nations  to  plan,  staff,  train,  equip,  and  conduct 
on-site  inspections  under  the  CFE  Treaty. 

The  book  begins  with  the  CFE  Treaty’s  signature  in  November  1990,  and  it  concludes  with  the 
signing  of  the  Final  Document  at  the  First  Review  Conference  in  May  1996.  Between  those  years,  the 
treaty  nations  collectively  reduced  more  than  50,000  conventional  weapons — tanks,  artillery,  ar¬ 
mored  combat  vehicles,  fighters,  and  helicopters.  Hundreds,  if  not  thousands,  of  on-site  inspectors 
monitored  these  reductions  in  accordance  with  the  protocols  of  the  treaty.  Inspection  standards  were 
established  and  sustained  across  national  borders.  A  rule  of  law  was  replacing  the  rule  of  force. 

Many  of  the  inspectors  had  been  soldiers  of  the  Cold  War;  now  they  were  monitoring  force  reduc¬ 
tions  under  a  complex  peace  treaty.  Quietly,  professionally,  effectively  these  inspectors  and  their 
respective  governments  ensured  that  the  new  rule  of  “law,”  as  detailed  in  the  CFE  Treaty,  was  being 
enforced. 

Agency  support  for  the  research  and  writing  of  this  history  was  directly  attributable  to  the  sup¬ 
port  of  Brigadier  General  Thomas  E.  Kuenning,  Jr.,  USAF,  OSIA  Director  (1995-  ),  and  Brigadier 
General  Gregory  G.  Govan,  USA,  OSIA  Director  (1993-1995).  Dr.  Joerg  H.  Menzel,  OSIA’s  Principal 
Deputy  Director,  took  a  personal  interest  and  shepherded  the  project  from  the  sharp  knives  of  those 
hostile  to  major  long-term  efforts.  Colonel  Paul  H.  Nelson,  USA,  OSIA’s  Chief  of  Staff,  read  the 
manuscript  and  encouraged  the  authors  at  every  step  along  the  way  in  the  final  two  years.  Colonel 
Lawrence  G.  Kelley,  USMC,  OSIA  European  Operations  Command,  read  every  word,  wrote  incisive 
comments,  and  then  discussed  each  comment  with  us  personally.  His  intellect  and  professionalism 
strengthened  the  final  book  in  numerous  ways.  Colonel  Kenneth  D.  Guillory,  Commander  of  the 
OSIA’s  European  Operations  Command,  contributed  his  support  to  the  project  in  its  final  year. 

We  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  assistance  and  helpful  suggestions  of  all  of  the  people  of 
OSIA’s  European  Operations  Command.  We  interviewed  many  of  the  team  chiefs,  inspectors,  plan¬ 
ners,  logisticians,  and  commanders;  their  opinions  and  insights  helped  straighten  out  the  often  con¬ 
fusing  references  to  treaty  protocols,  tables,  paragraphs,  and  subparagraphs.  In  particular  the  follow¬ 
in' 


ing  NCOs  and  officers  shared  their  time  and  experiences:  Stephen  Barneby,  Mark  Bumala,  David 
Carter,  William  Chesney,  Joe  Drach,  Tom  Dudley,  Ed  Gallagher,  Les  Garrison,  David  Gessert,  Jan 
Karcz,  Gary  Karstens,  Michael  Lukes,  Jack  Monahan,  Keith  Oatman,  Richard  O’Shea,  George  Par¬ 
tridge,  Ken  Periman,  Tom  Regan,  Larry  Schultz,  Mike  Slifka,  Bill  Smith,  and  Ron  Tait.  In  the  review 
process,  senior  officials  in  the  JCS,  OSD  (Policy),  and  OSD(Acquisition)  read  and  critiqued  the  manu¬ 
script  for  policy  and  operations  considerations.  In  that  process,  Mary  Margaret  Evans,  OSD,  Acquisi¬ 
tion,  was  especially  helpful. 

When  it  came  time  for  assembling  the  final  book  in  all  of  its  parts — the  tables,  charts,  appendi¬ 
ces,  bibliography,  and  fact  checking — we  are  indebted  to  David  Willford  of  the  History  Office.  His 
diligence  and  intelligence  made  it  a  better  history.  Stephen  Jimenez  contributed  to  the  chronology  and 
appendices.  Rolen  Maddox  helped  cross-check  every  name,  place,  figure,  and  bibliographic  reference. 
Bob  Coleman  and  Tom  Pearlman  developed  the  cover  art  and  maps,  and  assisted  with  other  photo¬ 
graphs  throughout  the  book.  At  EEI,  Judy  Cleary  and  Gayle  Dahlman  guided  the  book  through 
production,  Baiba  Seefer  edited  the  manuscript,  and  Jennifer  Whittington  created  the  design  and 
layout,  with  the  assistance  of  Lynn  Whiteley.  Rey  Ovalle  steered  the  finished  design  through  the 
government  bureaucracies  to  final  publishing.  Everyone  knows  that  publishing  a  textbook  of  this 
nature  is  both  an  individual  and  a  collective  work.  Individually,  the  authors  researched  and  wrote  the 
book,  and  they  are  credited  on  its  cover  and  title  pages.  Collectively,  the  contributions  of  the  others 
are  mentioned  only  here.  This  fact  obscures  the  appreciation  we  hold  for  their  work  and  contribu¬ 
tions.  We  simply  could  not  have  completed  this  history  without  them.

President  Bush  and  the  leaders  of  21  nations  sign  the  CFE  Treaty  in  Paris,  France,  on  November  19,  1990. 


On  November  19,  1990,  the  leaders  of  Western  Europe,  the 
United  States,  Canada,  the  Soviet  Union,  and  Central 
Europe  gathered  in  Paris  to  sign  the  Conventional  Armed 
Forces  in  Europe  Treaty.1  The  CFE  Treaty  came  amidst  profound 
historical  changes  that  were  sweeping  across  the  European  conti¬ 
nent  at  the  end  of  the  Cold  War.2  During  this  time  of  transition, 
the  treaty  served  as  an  international  structural  bridge.  The  CFE 
Treaty  was  both  an  arms  reduction  treaty,  which  mandated  the 
signatory  states  to  collectively  reduce  more  than  38,500  military 
weapons,  and  a  conflict  prevention  treaty.  To  prevent  (or,  more 
accurately,  reduce  the  probability  of)  conflict  in  Central  Europe, 
the  CFE  Treaty  required  the  signatory  nations  to  permanently 
reduce  their  stationed  military  forces  in  designated  geographical 
zones  in  Central  and  Western  Europe  and  on  the  flanks  of  the 
Soviet  Union.  Under  the  CFE  Treaty,  verification  measures  were 
the  most  extensive,  intrusive,  and  complex  of  any  modern  arms 
control  agreement.  The  heart  of  verification  was  and  remains  on¬ 
site  inspections  under  the  CFE  Treaty.

Moscow  streets  during  August  1991  coup  attempt;  the 
Soviet  Union  collapsed  on  December  25,  1991. 


By  the  fall  of  1990,  European  stability,  char¬ 
acterized  by  the  post-World  War  II  division  of 
Eastern  and  Western  Europe  and  the  ‘  German 
Question,”  had  changed  decisively.4  For  more 
than  four  decades,  ever  since  the  Berlin  Blockade  of  1948,  the  threat 
of  a  continental  European  war  had  been  present.  In  1989-90  that 
threat  was  ending.  For  the  new  Europe,  the  CFE  Treaty  represented 
a  practical  measure,  especially  with  its  extensive,  intrusive  verifica¬ 
tion  process,  for  establishing  a  new  international  process  that  would 
both  reduce  and  establish  lower  levels  of  offensive  military  forces 
and  their  deployment  for  the  1990s  and  beyond. 


The  process  of  implementing  this  cross- 
European  treaty,  stretching  from  the  Atlantic 
Ocean  to  the  Ural  Mountains,  began  with  the 
signatory  nations’  exchanging  thousands  of  pages 
of  military  force  data,  establishing  verification 
agencies  to  conduct  thousands  of  on-site  inspec¬ 
tions,  developing  new  data  systems  for  monitor¬ 
ing  the  presence  of  tens  of  thousands  of  military 
weapons,  and  traversing  millions  of  miles  of 
territory  to  inspect  declared  sites,  objects  of 
verification,  and  specified  areas.  While  the  lead¬ 
ers  of  22  nations  had  signed  the  CFE  Treaty  in 
November  1990,  there  were  29  nations  that 
provisionally  implemented  the  treaty  at  entry 
into  force  in  July  1992.  The  increase  in  signatory 
nations  was  the  direct  consequence  of  larger 
historical  forces  reshaping  the  European  conti¬ 
nent:  Eastern  Europe’s  political  revolutions, 
Germany’s  unification,  and  the  Soviet  Union’s 
collapse.  As  a  result,  seven  new  nations,  all 
drawn  from  the  former  Soviet  Union,  became 
signatory  states.  In  1993,  the  dissolution  of 
Czechoslovakia  as  a  nation  resulted  in  two  new 
nations,  the  Czech  and  Slovak  Republics,  becom¬ 
ing  signatory  states.  Thus,  30  nations  imple¬ 
mented  the  CFE  Treaty.3 


In  retrospect,  it  seemed  so  straightforward.  The  Cold  War  era 
had  ended  and  the  post-Cold  War  era  had  begun.  Events  of  his¬ 
toric  proportions  came  so  rapidly  in  1989-92  that  all  of  Europe 
seemed,  for  a  few  years,  to  move  in  one,  and  only  one,  direction — 
toward  democratic  revolution.  But  as  people  swept  up  in  contem¬ 
porary  events  know,  change  is  straightforward  only  in  history 
books.  The  present  rarely  is  so  clear.  This  realization  was  particu¬ 
larly  true  for  the  men  and  women  entrusted  with  implementing 
and  monitoring  the  CFE  Treaty  “on  the  ground.”  As  military 
professionals,  they  had  to  build  new  treaty  verification  agencies 
and  staffs.  As  on-site  inspectors  monitoring  a  multinational  treaty, 


3 


The  Treaty  and  the  Mission 


they  had  to  cross  bridges  that  stretched  across  Europe’s  older, 
west-to-east  national  boundaries.  These  new  bridges  crossed  to 
places,  peoples,  and  military  sites  not  visited,  much  less  inspected, 
for  more  than  45  years.  Consequently,  there  were  days,  even 
months,  when  the  footing  secured  by  the  treaty  seemed  unsure.  At 
times,  the  treaty’s  very  foundation — its  legal  authority  sanctioned 
by  national  ratification — seemed  certain  to  collapse.  At  other 
times,  the  treaty  appeared  to  be  carrying  more  of  Europe’s  security 
structure  than  it  was  designed  to  carry.  Uncertainty  was  the  rule 
for  months  and  months.  It  is  this  uncertainty  that  makes  this  his¬ 
tory  interesting.  A  rule  of  law  was  replacing  a  rule  of  force.  No 
one  was  certain  if  the  historical  circumstances  that  created  the 
political  and  military  consensus  for  the  signing  of  the  CFE  Treaty 
would  continue  throughout  its  implementation. 

The  CFE  Treaty  signing  in  Paris  in  November  1990  came  at 
the  midpoint  of  a  series  of  political  and  military  changes  occurring 
in  Europe,  the  Soviet  Union,  and  to  a  far  lesser  degree,  the  United 
States.  Arms  control  treaties  and  agreements  in  the  late  1980s  had 
legitimized  many  of  these  changes  and,  in  a  few  instances,  they  set 
the  stage  for  more  revolutionary  developments.  The  Stockholm 
Agreement  of  1986  was  the  first  step.  Then,  in  December  1987, 
President  Ronald  W.  Reagan  and  General  Secretary  Mikhail  S. 
Gorbachev  signed  the  Intermediate-Range  Nuclear  Forces  (INF) 
Treaty  in  Washington,  D.C.  That  treaty  was  a  diplomatic  and 
military  watershed;  its  elimination  provisions  and  implementation 
measures  set  precedents  for  all  subsequent  modern  arms  control 
treaties.  In  the  next  five  years,  the  United  States,  the  Soviet  Union, 
and  their  allies  negotiated  and  signed  two  bilateral  and  five  multi¬ 
lateral  treaties:  Threshold  Test  Ban  Treaty  (1990),  Conventional 
Armed  Forces  in  Europe  Treaty  (1990),  Strategic  Arms  Reduction 
Treaty  (1991),  Vienna  Document  Agreements  (1990,  1992,  and 
1994),  Open  Skies  Treaty  (1992),  Strategic  Arms  Reduction  Treaty 
II  (1993),  and  the  Chemical  Weapons  Convention  (1993).’ 

All  these  treaties  incorporated  on-site  inspection  as  an  impor¬ 
tant  element  in  monitoring  compliance.  The  first  treaty,  the  INF 
Treaty,  stipulated  extensive  on-site  inspection  rights.  These  rights 
were  so  extensive  that  President  Reagan  authorized  the  establish¬ 
ment  of  a  new  agency  to  conduct  U.S.  inspections  of  Soviet  facili¬ 
ties  and  to  escort  Soviet  inspection  teams  at  U.S.  military  facilities. 
That  new  agency,  established  in  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense 
on  January  26,  1988,  was  the  On-Site  Inspection  Agency  (OSIA). 
While  the  small  but  growing  cadre  of  OSIA  men  and  women  orga¬ 
nized,  trained,  and  conducted  inspections  in  the  initial  phases  of 
the  INF  Treaty,  negotiations  continued  in  Vienna  and  Geneva  on 
other,  more  extensive,  arms  control  treaties.  One  of  these,  the 
Treaty  Between  the  Twenty-Two  Sovereign  Nations  on  the  Reduc¬ 
tion  of  Their  Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe,  became 
known  as  the  CFE  Treaty.6

The  Helsinki  Process,  officially  called  the  Conference  on 
Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE),  provided  the  plat¬ 
form  for  CFE  Treaty  negotiations.  The  Cold  War  had  divided 
Europe  politically,  economically,  and  militarily.  On  July  3,  1973, 
more  than  25  years  into  the  Cold  War,  delegates  from  35  nations, 
including  neutral  and  nonaligned  European  nations,  the  United 
States,  Canada,  and  the  Soviet  Union,  met  in  Helsinki,  Finland,  to 
bridge  those  divisions.  This  meeting  was  the  first  in  a  continuing 
series  of  CSCE  conferences  and  meetings  held  in  national  capitals 
across  Europe.  At  these  meetings,  delegates  from  the  CSCE  nations 
attempted  to  define  and  agree  upon  a  set  of  legal  principles  that 
would  apply  to  all  European  states  and  peoples.  The  first  signifi¬ 
cant  phase  of  this  process  culminated  in  August  1975  with  the 
signing  of  the  Helsinki  Final  Act. 

Through  the  Helsinki  Final  Act,  the  CSCE  nations  declared 
that  issues  concerning  the  future  of  Europe  should  be  discussed  in 
terms  of  three  areas,  or  “baskets.”  Basket  one  dealt  with  security 
in  Europe,  including  issues  such  as  national  self-determination, 
territorial  integrity,  and  the  peaceful  settlement  of  disputes.  Basket 
two  covered  progress  in  science,  technology,  and  the  environment. 
Basket  three  contained  human  rights  and  other  issues.  To  enhance 
military  security,  the  35  CSCE  states  agreed  to  the  concept  of 
negotiating  “confidence-building  measures  (CBMs).”  The  objec¬ 
tive  of  these  measures,  which  were  initially  quite  limited  in  scope 
because  of  the  rigidity  of  the  east-west  European  divisions  in  the 
Cold  War,  was  to  make  each  nation’s  military  capabilities  and 
intentions  more  transparent.  The  theory  was  that  if  nations  knew 
of  their  neighbors’  military  capability  and  intentions,  then  these 
nations  might  develop  confidence  in  their  international  relations 
and  possibly  reallocate  their  security  resources  to  other  national 
concerns.  Collectively,  the  European  continent  was  the  most 
heavily  armed  of  any  continent  in  the  world.  National  armies  and 
air  forces  were  large,  well  equipped,  and  modern.  Both  the  United 
States  and  the  Soviet  Union  had  stationed  large,  combat-ready 
armies  and  air  forces  in  Central  Europe.  The  first  confidence¬ 
building  measure,  signed  in  1975,  required  all  35  CSCE  nations  to 
provide  every  other  nation  a  21-day  advance  notice  of  any  military 
exercises  involving  more  than  21,000  troops.  Other  provisions 
stipulated  the  voluntary  notification  of  smaller  exercises  as  well  as 
large-scale  troop  movements  on  an  annual  calendar. 


In  contrast  to  the  successful  negotiation  and  institution  of 
these  CSCE  confidence-building  measures,  another  set  of  cross- 
European  diplomatic-military  negotiations,  the  Mutual  and  Bal¬ 
anced  Force  Reductions  (MBFRs),  did  not  fare  well.  These  nego¬ 
tiations  were  between  the  representatives  of  two  alliances:  the 
North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO)  and  the  Warsaw 


_ The  Treaty  and  the  Mission

Treaty  Organization  (WTO).  Initiated  in  1973,  the  negotiations 
lasted  intermittently  for  17  years.  They  were  never  able  to  get  past 
several  stumbling  blocks.  NATO  sought  reductions  in  military 
personnel  stationed  in  Europe,  whereas  WTO  proposed  equal 
reductions  in  both  military  personnel  and  weapons.  The  objective, 
NATO  argued,  would  be  to  achieve,  after  several  phased  with¬ 
drawals,  end-strength  parity  in  the  forces  of  both  alliances.  The 
Warsaw  Pact,  as  the  WTO  was  commonly  known,  countered  that 
both  alliances  should  be  reducing  the  same  number  of  personnel 
and  weapons,  leaving  the  end  strength  unbalanced.  Neither  alli¬ 
ance  would  agree  during  the  lengthy  negotiations  whether  to  make 
the  cuts  in  equal  slices  or  through  gradual  reductions  leading  to 
parity.  Nor  could  they  agree  on  whether  the  cuts  should  be  made 
on  an  alliance-to-alliance  or  a  nation-by-nation  basis.  In  addition, 
a  major  U.S.  concern  was  that  there  was  no  satisfactory  method  to 
verify  personnel  cuts.  In  lieu  of  any  agreement  in  these  protracted 
and  frustrating  MBFR  negotiations,  both  NATO  and  WTO  mod¬ 
ernized  their  conventional  weapons  and  maintained  their  focus  on 
combat  readiness.  Huge,  modern,  massed  armies  and  air  forces 
continued  to  face  each  other  across  a  line  running  through  a  di¬ 
vided  Germany.8

Throughout  these  years,  the  35  CSCE  nations  continued 
meeting  in  a  series  of  lengthy  conferences  in  Madrid,  Stockholm, 
and  Vienna.  The  Madrid  meetings  began  in  November  1980  and

led  to  the  delegates  agreeing  on  a  September  1983  CSCE  Mandate. 
This  mandate  called  for  all  delegates  to  negotiate  agreements 
implementing  not  only  confidence-building  measures  among  the 
states  of  Europe,  but  alsomew  treaties  leading  to  the  gradual  disar¬ 
mament  of  Europe.  At  the  Madrid  meeting,  the  CSCE  nations 
accepted  a  broader  definition  of  Europe  as  envisioned  first  by 
French  President  Charles  de  Gaulle,  then  by  President  Valery 
Giscard  d’Estaing,  and  finally  strongly  articulated  and  argued  by 
the  United  States.  It  defined  Europe  as  stretching  from  the  Atlantic 
Ocean  to  the  Ural  Mountains.9  This  meant  that  any  future  agree¬ 
ment  or  treaty  would  include  military  forces  and  equipment  sta¬ 
tioned  across  the  length  and  breadth  of  Europe,  including  the 
interior  of  the  Soviet  Union.  This  definition  had  significant  impli¬ 
cations  for  the  CFE  Treaty. 

Three  years  later  in  Stockholm,  in  September  1986,  CSCE 
delegates  agreed  to  new  confidence  and  security  building  measures 
(CSBMs).  These  measures  required  notification  of  military  exer¬ 
cises  involving  more  than  13,000  troops  and  provided  for  on-site 
inspection  of  field  activities  involving  17,000  or  more  ground 
forces  or  5,000  or  more  airborne  troops,  with  no  right  of  refusal 
by  the  inspected  nation.  Known  as  the  Stockholm  Document  of 
1986,  this  was  the  first  multinational  agreement  that  the  Soviet 
Union  signed  permitting  on-site  inspections  on  its  own  territory  to 
verify  an  arms  control  accord.1" 

In  agreeing  to  the  Stockholm  Document,  Gorbachev  signaled 
his  intent  to  accelerate  negotiations  for  reducing  military  arma¬ 
ments  across  Europe.  Throughout  1986-87,  Gorbachev  gave  a 
series  of  dramatic  speeches,  calling  upon  European  and  American 
leaders  to  consider  phased  reductions  in  conventional  and  nuclear 
forces  based  on  the  European  continent.  He  changed  the  course  of 
all  previous  negotiations  by  conceding  that  since  the  Soviet  Union 
had  numerically  superior  conventional  forces  in  Europe,  the 
NATO  nations  might  reasonably  conclude  that  these  forces  were  a 
threat.  He  further  stated  that  under  any  negotiated  all-European 
arms  control  treaty,  the  side  with  the  greater  number  of  forces 
ought  to  take  a  larger  share  of  the  reductions,  provided  there  was 
adequate  verification  through  on-site  inspections.  Under  the  Soviet 
Union’s  leadership,  the  seven-nation  Warsaw  Treaty  Organization 
met  in  Budapest  and  endorsed  Gorbachev’s  proposals.11 

Responding  to  these  significant  new  Soviet  and  Warsaw  Pact 
initiatives,  the  foreign  ministers  of  NATO  created  a  High  Level 
Task  Force  (HLTF)  in  May  1986  to  develop  a  coordinated  alliance 
proposal  for  a  conventional  arms  reduction  treaty.  Following  long 
and  difficult  internal  discussions  within  the  16-nation  alliance,  this 
NATO  task  force  produced  a  negotiating  position  in  December 
1986.  The  NATO  foreign  ministers  in  their  December  meeting 


7 


he  Treaty  and  the  Mission

proposed  a  two-track  negotiating  strategy.  One  would  consist  of 
the  35  CSCE  nations’  pursuing  broader  and  more  transparent 
confidence-building  measures.  The  other  would  have  the  NATO 
nations  and  the  WTO  nations  negotiate  phased  reductions  and 
stability  provisions  for  their  conventional  forces  in  Europe.  This 
two-track  strategy  was  adopted.12 

Just  five  weeks  later,  negotiators  from  23  states  (16  NATO, 

7  WTO)  met  in  Vienna  on  February  17,  1987,  to  discuss  treaty 
negotiating  guidelines.  Nearly  two  years  of  detailed,  often  techni¬ 
cal  discussions,  both  among  the  allied  nations  and  between  the 
alliances,  produced  on  January  14,  1989,  the  Mandate  for  Nego¬ 
tiation  on  Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe.  This  mandate 
established  the  fundamental  negotiating  principles  for  the  CFE 
Treaty.  Specifically,  the  treaty  would  include  provisions  to  reduce 
or  prevent  the  capability  of  any  nation,  or  group  of  nations,  to 
mass  military  forces  on  the  European  continent  in  order  to  launch 
a  surprise  attack  across  national  borders.  The  treaty  would  seek  to 
significantly  reduce  offensive  military  hardware;  these  reductions 
would  be  asymmetric,  with  the  objective  of  an  end-strength  parity 
between  alliances.  In  addition,  the  treaty  would  contain  provisions 
for  a  robust  and  intrusive  verification  regime.1'

Twenty-three  states  began  negotiations  under  the  Cold  War 
structure  of  Europe.  The  NATO  alliance,  16  nations  including  the 
United  States,  formed  one  side;  the  Warsaw  Pact,  7  nations  domi¬ 
nated  by  the  Soviet  Union,  constituted  the  other.  Although  these 
nations  shared  negotiating  goals  and  strategies  as  members  within 
their  alliances,  they  were  independent,  sovereign  nations.  Under 
the  treaty  being  negotiated,  the  individual  signatory  states  would 
hold  all  rights  and  obligations.  Recognizing  this  fact,  French  nego¬ 
tiators  successfully  argued  for  not  identifying  in  the  formal  treaty 
language  either  the  NATO  or  the  Warsaw  Pact  alliance.  Instead, 
the  French  persuaded  the  other  nations  to  use  the  term  “group  of 
state  parties”  to  refer  to  the  two  alliances.14  This  became  a  critical 
treaty  term  since  it  allowed  negotiators  to  incorporate  the  existing 
bloc-versus-bloc  structure  as  an  integral  element  of  the  treaty 
while  holding  the  individual  states  responsible  for  treaty  imple¬ 
mentation.  This  dualism  remained  in  the  treaty  despite  revolution¬ 
ary  changes  that  transpired  in  Eastern  Europe  and  in  the  Soviet 
Union  in  1990-92.

In  late  1989,  the  East  Germans  revolted;  the  Berlin  Wall  fell, 
and  the  German  Democratic  Republic’s  communist  government 
collapsed.  German  unification  became  a  serious  possibility.  Ger¬ 
man  Chancellor  Helmut  Kohl,  Soviet  General  Secretary  Mikhail  S. 
Gorbachev,  British  Prime  Minister  Margaret  H.  Thatcher,  French 
President  Francois  Mitterrand,  and  American  President  George 
Bush  participated  in  a  series  of  dramatic  meetings  in  1990.  These 
negotiations  culminated  in  a  series  of  international  agreements 
that  recognized  Germany  as  a  single,  unified  nation,  effective 
October  3,  1990.  While  these  events  unfolded,  the  Warsaw  Pact 
collapsed.  This  collapse  was  a  direct  consequence  of  the  “velvet” 
revolutions  in  Eastern  Europe  in  1988-89  as  the  peoples  of 
Poland,  Hungary,  Romania,  Czechoslovakia,  and  Bulgaria  rejected 
their  communist  governments.  Equally  important  was  the  fact  that 
Gorbachev  and  the  leaders  of  the  Soviet  Union  allowed  the  revolu¬ 
tions  to  proceed.  Previous  attempts  by  Warsaw  Pact  nations  to 
depart  from  communism  had  resulted  in  forceful  Soviet  military 
intervention.  In  1989-90,  by  contrast,  Soviet  troops  were  with¬ 
drawing  from  Eastern  Europe.15 

All  these  events  influenced  the  CFE  Treaty.  The  issue  of 
German  unification  posed  several  concerns  for  treaty  negotiators. 
A  united  Germany  would  possess  a  large,  modern  armed  force. 

It  would  have  the  largest  national  army  and  air  force  in  Central 
Europe.  Twice  in  the  20th  century,  Germany  had  sought  to  domi¬ 
nate  continental  Europe.  Acknowledging  this  legacy,  German 
Chancellor  Kohl  pledged  that  his  government  would  reduce  the 
size  of  the  new  nation’s  military  forces.  Germany  submitted  a 
special  declaration  to  be  included  in  the  CFE  Treaty.  The  “Decla¬ 
ration  by  the  Government  of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  on 
the  Personnel  Strength  of  German  Armed  Forces”  stated  that

Germany  would  cut  its  troop  strength  to  370,000  three  to  four 
years  from  the  day  the  CFE  Treaty  entered  into  force.16  This  decla¬ 
ration  persuaded  other  nations  to  declare  their  willingness  to 
negotiate  uto  limit  the  personnel  strengths  of  their  conventional 
armed  forces.”  Although  negotiators  did  not  reach  agreement  on 
this  issue  in  time  for  the  signing  of  the  CFE  Treaty  in  Paris  in 
November  1990,  they  continued  negotiations  throughout  1991 
and  1992.  By  July  1992,  the  time  of  the  treaty’s  entry  into  force, 
national  personnel  limits  were  contained  in  a  separate  document, 
entitled  the  CFE  1A  Concluding  Act. 

Another  event,  also  larger  than  the  treaty  and  influencing  it, 
was  General  Secretary  Gorbachev’s  unilateral  declaration  at  the 
United  Nations  in  December  1988  to  withdraw  six  tank  divisions 
(50,000  men)  from  the  nations  of  Central  Europe.17  This  unprec¬ 
edented,  massive  Soviet  military  withdrawal,  coupled  with  the 
Eastern  European  nations  discarding  communist  governments  for 
democratic  rule,  resulted  in  a  weakened,  impotent  military  alliance 
among  the  Warsaw  Pact  nations.  Just  five  months  before  the  CFE 
Treaty’s  signature,  the  Hungarian  National  Assembly  on  June  26, 
1990,  voted  232-0  to  initiate  negotiations  for  Hungary  to  leave  the 
Soviet-dominated  Warsaw  Pact.18  Since  the  framework  of  the  CFE 
Treaty  rested  on  a  group  of  states  as  the  basic  unit  for  all  reduc¬ 
tions  and  end-strength  parity,  a  breakup  of  the  WTO  presented  the 
possibility  that  those  nations  would  no  longer  act  as  a  group.  This 
did  not  happen.  The  Eastern  European  states  did  not  want  the 
possible  dissolution  of  the  alliance  to  prevent  the  CFE  Treaty  from 
entering  into  force. 


The  CFE  Treaty  was  negotiated  under  a  NATO/WTO  scenario.

On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


Ambassador  Grinevsky  on  Soviet  Negotiations 


A  professional  diplomat,  Oleg  Grinevsky  led  the  De¬ 
partment  of  Mid-Eastern  Affairs,  USSR  Ministry  of 
Foreign  Affairs,  from  1978  through  1983.  During  the 
next  two  years,  he  served  as  the  Soviet  Ambassador  to 
the  Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Eu¬ 
rope.  Then,  in  1985,  he  became  the  Chief  Arms  Con¬ 
trol  Negotiator  for  the  USSR  for  the  CFE  Treaty.  For 
the  next  five  years,  he  worked  directly  with  President 
Mikhail  Gorbachev  and  Foreign  Minister 
Shevardnadze  to  negotiate  the  treaty. 


On  Soviet  leaders  and  the  concept  of  on-site 
inspections:  “In  December  1985,  Gorbachev  had 
a  one-on-one  with  each  of  his  arms  control  nego¬ 
tiators.  He  wanted  to  start  ‘real  negotiations’ 
with  ‘real  reductions’  in  armaments  to  make 
Europe  and  the  world  less  militarized  and  less 
dangerous.  During  the  time  of  [Conference  on 
Disarmament  in  Europe]  negotiations  in 
Stockholm,  I  suggested  that  we  accept  one  or  two 
on-site  inspections  every  year  of  Soviet  forces 
because  it  would  convince  the  West  of  our  good 
intentions  and  [it]  would  not  harm  our  military 
position  in  any  way.” 

On  resistance  within  the  Soviet  Politburo:  “In  the 
meetings  on  arms  control,  the  sides  were  gener¬ 
ally  Gorbachev,  Shevardnadze,  Yakolev,  and 
Grinevsky  against  Marshal  Akhromeyev, 
the  KGB  Chief,  the  Director  of  the  Central 
Committee’s  International  Department,  and  the 
Military  Departments.  Marshal  Akhromeyev  was 
the  key  member  of  the  Politburo  who  opposed 
the  CDE  measures.  As  the  head  military  officer, 
his  ideas  were  important  and  persuasive.  But  he 
was  very  ‘explosive,’  and  would  speak  out  force¬ 
fully  on  his  views. 

“The  Politboro  met  on  weekends.  I  would 
return  from  Stockholm  and  present  the  results  of 
that  week’s  negotiations.  The  arguments  were 
heated.  Usually,  they  took  the  form  of  my  intro¬ 
ducing  a  proposal  and,  if  it  was  unacceptable, 
Akhromeyev  would  ‘explode,’  explaining  that  the 
proposal  endangered  the  military  security  of  the 


state.  Gorbachev  would  then  step  in  and  ‘medi¬ 
ate’  the  dispute,  making  sure  at  the  end  that 
everyone  on  the  Politburo  agreed.  This  happened 
on  the  discussions  on  the  on-site  inspection  mea¬ 
sures,  and  that  is  how  it  was  resolved.” 

On  Gorbachev  and  Soviet  participation  in  the 
more  radical  arms  control  treaty  negotiations: 
“First  of  all,  there  was  the  economic  situation  in 
the  country.  The  USSR  needed  time  and  resources 
to  improve  its  economic  situation....  Second,  to 
do  this  we  had  to  improve  relations  with  the  West 
to  reduce  tensions,  to  make  economic  relations 
easier  by  getting  rid  of  the  West’s  biggest  fear,  the 
size  and  power  of  the  Soviet  military  forces  in 
Europe.  We  wanted  to  change  our  military  profile 
in  Europe  and  reduce  our  dominance  over  East¬ 
ern  Europe. 

“We  actually  succeeded,  especially  after 
the  CFE  Treaty,  which,  by  the  way,  only 
Shevardnadze  really  supported.  Shevardnadze 
realized  that  only  after  this  treaty  would  the 
USSR  be  safe  from  a  Western  attack.  The  country 
would  be  able  to  save  resources  from  the  conven¬ 
tional  force  reductions  to  use  elsewhere. 

“Conventional  forces  are  very  expensive,  and 
the  money  saved  would  be  considerable.  But 
virtually  all  of  the  others  opposed  the  CFE  Treaty 
because  the  USSR  would  be  giving  up  its  ‘over¬ 
whelming  military  advantage’  in  Europe.  They 
could  not  visualize  a  Soviet  Union  that  did  not 
have  a  huge  and  powerful  military,  even  if  it 
meant  better  living  conditions  for  the  people.”

The  Treaty  and  the  Mission  1 1 


Ambassador  Hansen  on  U.S.  Negotiations 


Lynn  M.  Hansen  was  the  U.S.  Ambassador  to  the 
Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe, 
1992-93.  In  1989-90,  he  served  on  the  U.S.  delega¬ 
tion  negotiating  the  CFE  Treaty.  Educated  at  Utah 
State  University,  Hansen  was  a  Fulbright  Scholar  to 
the  Free  University  of  Berlin.  The  recipient  of  an 
M.A.  and  a  Ph.D.,  he  is  fluent  in  German,  Dutch, 
Swedish,  and  Russian.  Currently,  Ambassador 
Hansen  is  Vice  Chairman  for  Evaluation,  National 
Intelligence  Council. 

On  the  Bush  administration’s  decision  to  pursue  the 
CEE  Treaty:  “The  United  States  made  the  decision 
to  push  the  treaty  sometime  in  1989.  It  began  in 
March  1989,  but  there  was  a  little  bit  of  time  before 
they  really  made  the  decision  that,  by  golly,  we  are 
going  to  get  this  agreement.  They  brought  in  Jim 
Woolsey  [as  Chief  Negotiator],  and  I  came  with 
him.  That  was  in  November  1989.  It  was  precisely 
the  time  when  the  Berlin  Wall  came  down.” 

The  INF  Treaty  as  a  precedent:  “The  INF  experi¬ 
ence  was  both  a  positive  and  negative  model  for  us. 

It  was  positive  insofar  as  we  and  the  Soviet  Union 
had  an  experience  which  we  shared,  and  we  knew 
what  had  to  be  done.  But  this  very  fact  was  resented 
by  some,  particularly  the  French,  who  took  some 
pains  to  make  sure  that  we  did  not  use  INF  termi¬ 
nology  very  much.  But  since  it  was  the  only  experi¬ 
ence  anyone  had,  we  still  used  it.  So  it  was  very, 
very  important  to  us  in  terms  of  methodologies  and 
procedures.... 

“Clearly,  there  were  two  things  that  influenced 
us.  One  was,  of  course,  the  INF  Treaty.  The  second 
was  the  shared  experience  everybody  had  with  the 
Stockholm  Agreement.  That  was  a  European-domi¬ 
nated  experience,  and  it  was  very,  very  important.  I 
think  it  was  every  bit  as  important  to  the  Europeans 
and  to  the  negotiation  of  the  CFE  Treaty  as  was  the 
INF  Treaty.  Thirty-five  nations  had  shared  in  that 
experience,  but  only  23  were  in  the  CFE  negotia¬ 
tions — and  all  of  them  had  been  involved  in  the 
Stockholm  Agreement,  every  one.” 

Negotiating  the  final  CFE  Treaty  verification  issues: 
“As  we  proceeded  through  negotiations  we  were 
able  to  resolve  most  of  the  issues  up  until  October 
1990.  We  were  within  a  month  of  treaty  signing  and

didn’t  have  the  basic  question  of  a  site  versus  an 
object  of  verification  resolved.  It  was  the  basis  for 
calculating  the  number  of  inspections,  and  what  we 
were  to  inspect.  In  October  1990,  the  Russians  paid 
a  visit  to  Washington.  A  small  team  of  us  took 
Soviet  Ambassador  Grinevsky  into  a  room  in  the 
State  Department  and  we  talked  about  the  CFE 
Treaty,  specifically  verification. 

“The  [U.S.]  interagency  community,  or  more 
accurately,  decisionmakers  at  a  high  level,  had 
decided  that  they  would  accept  the  Soviets’  object 
of  verification  concept,  provided  the  Soviets  would 
agree  to  the  way  it  would  be  implemented.  We  put 
this  proposition  to  Ambassador  Grinevsky.  He 
indicated  that  he  wanted  the  appropriate  people 
involved.  We  requested  that  he  send  his  verification 
negotiator  to  the  U.S.  He  called  him  over.  His  name 
was  Gennadiy  Yefstaviyev.  We  met  in  New  York. 

The  idea  was  that  while  the  UN  First  Committee 
was  in  session,  we  would  attempt  to  resolve  the 
final  parts  of  the  CFE  Treaty. 

“I  arranged  my  room  in  the  Waldorf  Astoria  to 
be  a  little  negotiating  room.  As  it  turns  out,  only  I 
and  Yefstaviyev  used  it.  One  on  one,  we  wrote  out 
the  final  parts  of  the  verification  protocol,  which 
included  the  concept  of  object  of  verification  and 
access  to  the  declared  sites.  We  also  developed  the 
definition  of  a  declared  site  and  other  definitions 
which  have  stood  the  test  of  time  rather  well. 

“Basically,  we  did  it  this  way.  My  negotiating 
style  was  to  write  everything  down.  Then,  these 
texts  were  given  to  Mr.  Shevardnadze  and  Secretary 
Baker.  They  would  meet,  discuss,  and  bless  them.  By 
the  time  that  New  York  meeting  was  over,  we  had, 
for  all  intents  and  purposes,  an  agreement  on  the 
verification  protocol.”

On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


Consequently,  throughout  1990,  the  Central  European  War¬ 
saw  Pact  nations,  specifically  Poland,  Hungary,  Czechoslovakia, 
Romania,  and  Bulgaria,  continued  to  negotiate  as  a  “group  of 
state  parties,”  although  most  believed  that  the  Warsaw  Pact  would 
dissolve  by  the  end  of  1991.  In  the  negotiating  sessions,  these 
nations  took  positions  that  reflected  their  independent  national 
status,  but  in  the  final  treaty  text  and  implementing  protocols, 
they  agreed  to  retain  the  terminology  of  bloc-to-bloc  limits  and 
zones.  Since  Soviet  military  forces  were  still  withdrawing  from 
Eastern  Europe,  no  nation  wanted  to  impede  this  withdrawal.  This 
deliberate  political  act  allowed  the  basic  framework  of  the  treaty 
to  remain  in  place  while  the  East  European  nations  strengthened 
their  new  independent  governments.19 

By  October  1990,  most  major  treaty  provisions,  protocols, 
and  statements  had  been  agreed  to;  however,  the  basis  for  calcu¬ 
lating  the  number  of  inspections  had  not  been  determined.  The 
United  States  argued  that  the  location  of  treaty-limited  equipment 
(TLE)  and  military  units,  known  as  a  “declared  site,”  should  be 
the  basis  for  calculating  the  number  of  inspections.  The  declared 
site  was  what  an  inspection  team  would  inspect.  The  Soviets 
countered  that  the  number  of  inspections  should  be  based  on  the 
“objects  of  verification”  (OOVs).  The  OOV  was  a  declared  mili¬ 
tary  organization  that  held  equipment  limited  by 
the  treaty.  An  OOV  could  also  be  a  designated 
permanent  storage  site  that  held  TLE  not  associ¬ 
ated  with  a  specific  unit,  or  any  location,  where 
TLE  would  be  found  routinely.  The  Soviet  posi¬ 
tion  was  that  a  team  would  inspect  the  OOV — 
the  organization,  storage  depot,  or  location  and 
its  TLE,  not  the  entire  site  where  they  were 
located.  For  many,  this  distinction  was  difficult 
to  understand;  yet,  it  was  important  to  the  Soviet 
High  Command  because  they  colocated  many 
military  organizations  at  a  single  location.  The 
Soviet  Army  often  had  several  OOVs  on  a  single 
declared  site.  Here  was  a  major  disagreement, 
declared  site  versus  OOV,  and  neither  the  NATO 
nations  nor  the  Warsaw  Pact  nations  were  will¬ 
ing  to  compromise. 

In  an  eleventh-hour  effort,  American  CFE 
Treaty  negotiator  Lynn  M.  Hansen  and  Soviet 
CFE  Treaty  negotiator  Gennadiy  Yefstaviyev 
held  a  series  of  meetings  in  the  weeks  and  days 
before  the  treaty  was  signed.20  There  was  little 
time  for  extended  deliberations.  President  Bush 
had  stated  that  he  would  not  attend  the  Paris 
CSCE  Conference,  scheduled  for  mid-November 
1990,  if  a  CFE  Treaty  was  not  ready  for  signa-

ture.  Time  was  running  out;  in  late  October  Ambassador  Hansen 
met  with  Ambassador  Grinevsky  and  others  at  the  U.S.  State  De¬ 
partment  to  resolve  the  impasse.  Their  solution  recognized  the 
OOV  as  the  item  for  inspection,  but  also  granted  inspectors  access 
to  the  entire  site  except  for  areas  belonging  exclusively  to  another 
OOV.  Declared  site  areas  that  were  not  part  of  an  OOV,  were 
colloquially  referred  to  as  common  areas.  This  ambiguous  solution 
resolved  a  treaty  negotiating  impasse,  but  it  created  problems  later 
during  treaty  implementation. 

Long  before  this  issue  would  surface  during  actual  on-site 
inspections,  the  treaty  text  and  protocols  had  to  be  finalized, 
signed,  and  ratified.  To  complete  the  treaty,  Soviet  CFE  negotiator 
Yefstaviyev  went  to  New  York,  where  he  and  the  American  nego¬ 
tiator  Hansen  developed  the  final  segments  of  the  inspection  pro¬ 
tocol.  They  in  turn  persuaded  members  of  their  respective  blocs  in 
Budapest  and  Brussels  to  accept  the  negotiated  provisions.  How¬ 
ever,  this  U.S. -USSR  agreement  came  at  a  cost.  These  end  game 
negotiations  brought  to  a  head  a  belief  held  by  many  of  the  other 
signatory  states:  the  two  superpowers,  the  United  States  and  the 
USSR,  were  resolving  too  many  issues  bilaterally.  From  this  point 
forward,  the  CFE  Treaty  negotiators  from  the  European  states 
began  meeting  among  themselves.  A  stronger  “European”  perspec¬ 
tive  on  the  CFE  Treaty  and  its  implementation  began  to  emerge. 
Despite  this  development,  the  march  toward  final  agreement  con¬ 
tinued.  After  delegates  agreed  to  all  of  the  final  provisions,  the 
CFE  Treaty  was  ready  for  signature. 


CFE  Treaty  Signature 

In  mid-November  1990,  the  three-day  meeting  of  the  Confer¬ 
ence  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  convened  in  Paris. 

The  leaders  of  22  nations,  including  Bush,  Gorbachev,  Kohl, 
Mitterrand,  and  Thatcher,  signed  the  CFE  Treaty  on  November 
19,  1990.  At  that  point,  the  signatory  states  included  Belgium, 
Bulgaria,  Canada,  Czechoslovakia,  Denmark,  France,  Germany, 
Greece,  Hungary,  Iceland,  Italy,  Luxembourg,  Netherlands,  Nor¬ 
way,  Poland,  Portugal,  Romania,  Spain,  Turkey,  Soviet  Union, 
United  Kingdom,  and  the  United  States.  Amidst  all  the  historic 
changes  sweeping  across  the  European  continent,  the  CFE  Treaty 
constituted  a  new  legal  and  diplomatic  framework  for  reducing 
military  forces  and  limiting  national  aggression  in  post-Cold  War 
Europe.21 

The  CSCE  Conference’s  political  and  diplomatic  dimensions 
were  revealed  the  next  day  as  the  leaders  of  34  states  signed  the 
Charter  of  Paris  for  a  New  Europe.22  This  charter  codified  state¬ 
ments  on  human  rights,  democratic  values,  and  the  rule  of  law  for 
all  European  states  and  peoples.  At  the  same  session,  leaders  of  the

16  NATO  nations,  6  WTO  nations,  and  12  neutral  and  non- 
aligned  European  nations  pledged  to  seek  a  nonconfrontational 
security  structure  for  all  of  Europe.  That  structure  began,  of 
course,  with  their  endorsement  of  the  objectives  of  the  CFE  Treaty. 
Next,  they  agreed  to  establish  and  strengthen  CSCE  institutions.23 
A  new,  small  CSCE  Secretariat  would  be  established  in  Prague;  a 
CSCE  Conflict  Resolution  Center  would  be  set  up  in  Vienna,  and 
a  new  CSCE  Election  Monitoring  Office  would  be  located  in  War¬ 
saw.  At  the  same  time,  the  35  national  leaders  affirmed  their  com¬ 
mitment  to  follow  the  provisions  of  the  Vienna  Document  1990, 
an  important  new  cross-European  confidence  and  security  building 
measure  that  expanded  the  provisions  of  the  earlier  Stockholm 
Document  of  1986. 24  The  new  Vienna  Document  1990  stipulated 
annual  exchanges  of  military  force  data,  regular  military-to-mili- 
tary  contacts,  and  on-site  inspections  as  confidence  and  security 
building  measures.  When  the  three-day  CSCE  Conference  con¬ 
cluded,  it  was  seen  as  another  significant  step  in  the  transition  to 
post-Cold  War  Europe. 

President  Bush,  in  his  remarks  to  the  69  assembled  presidents, 
prime  ministers,  and  foreign  ministers,  cited  the  Helsinki  Final  Act 
of  1975  and  the  courage  of  the  European  peoples  who  worked  to 


15 


The  Treaty  and  the  Mission 


implement  the  CSCE  objectives.  He  noted  that  three  of  the  Euro¬ 
pean  leaders  present,  the  presidents  of  Poland,  Czechoslovakia, 
and  Bulgaria,  had  been  jailed  or  persecuted  for  exercising  their 
rights  under  the  Helsinki  Act.  President  Bush  asserted  that  the 
treaty  was  the  military  dimension  of  the  CSCE  process  and  that  it 
was  “the  most  far-reaching  arms  agreement”  ever  negotiated.25  In 
his  remarks,  President  Gorbachev  praised  the  CFE  Treaty  and 
called  for  action  on  the  other  arms  control  treaties  then  under 
negotiation,  especially  in  the  areas  of  strategic  nuclear  weapons.26 
When  they  spoke,  both  Chancellor  Kohl  and  President  Mitterrand 
took  a  longer,  European  view.  In  the  last  200  years,  Kohl  said, 
“Europe,  and  my  country  in  particular,  became  the  epicenter  of 
worldwide  catastrophes.”  Now,  he  declared  it  was  time  for  Euro¬ 
pean  peace.  Mitterrand  observed  that  for  the  first  time  in  Euro¬ 
pean  history  the  massive  changes  occurring  across  the  continent 
were  “not  the  outcome  of  war  or  bloody  revolution.”27 

Between  the  hyperbole  and  the  history  lay  the  signed  CFE 
Treaty.  But  before  it  could  enter  into  force,  it  had  to  be  ratified. 
That  process  would  take  nearly  two  years;  in  the  interim,  the 
treaty  became  the  subject  of  intense  scrutiny  by  those  responsible 
for  implementation. 


Anatomy  of  the  CFE  Treaty 


Text  and  Declarations 

The  CFE  Treaty  contained  23  articles  that  spelled  out 
treaty  definitions  and  requirements  in  terms  of  equipment, 
quantities,  locations,  and  time  periods.  The  treaty  outlined 
requirements  for  exchanges  of  information,  reductions 
(elimination  or  conversion  of  TLE),  and  on-site  inspec¬ 
tions.  It  also  authorized  the  formation  of  a  Joint  Consulta¬ 
tive  Group  (JCG)  of  all  signatory  nations  to  resolve  issues 
that  might  arise  during  the  life  of  the  treaty.  Eight  proto¬ 
cols  provided  detailed  procedural  guidance  on  the  require¬ 
ments  outlined  in  the  23  articles.  Finally,  three  important 
declarations  were  included  in  the  treaty.28 

The  first  declaration  defined  and  limited  the  number 
of  land-based  naval  aircraft  and  attack  helicopters.  This 
declaration  was  but  one  element  of  a  larger  problem  that 
treaty  negotiators  faced.  Combat  aircraft  had  been  a  par¬ 
ticularly  difficult  issue  during  treaty  negotiations.  The 
Eastern  group  of  states  held  an  advantage  of  more  than 
2,000  land-based  combat  aircraft  over  the  NATO  nations’ 
air  forces.  The  Soviet  Union  wanted  the  CFE  Treaty  limits 
to  codify  that  advantage.  If  the  NATO  nations  wanted  an 
equal  number  of  combat  aircraft,  the  Soviet  negotiators 
argued,  they  would  have  to  build  up  to  the  Eastern  group

Several  issues  concerning  combat  aircraft,  like  the  MiG-29,  were  contentious  in  negotiations. 


of  states’  treaty-authorized  totals.  NATO  representatives  coun¬ 
tered  that  the  goal  should  be  to  achieve  a  treaty-authorized  end- 
strength  figure  that  would  put  the  two  groups  of  states  on  an 
equal  footing  in  regard  to  the  final  number  of  combat  aircraft. 
NATO’s  proposal  would  require  the  Soviets  to  eliminate  thousands 
of  combat-ready  aircraft.  This  was  unacceptable  to  the  Soviet 
High  Command.29 

Another  aspect  of  the  same  problem  was  how  to  define  a 
combat  aircraft.  The  NATO  states  offered  a  definition  that 
focused  on  the  capability  of  the  aircraft.  If  an  aircraft  could  fly 
and  deliver  munitions,  they  argued,  it  was  a  combat  aircraft  and 
should  be  limited  by  the  treaty.  The  Eastern  group  of  states,  how¬ 
ever,  preferred  a  definition  that  categorized  military  aircraft  by 
mission.  Using  this  definition,  they  recommended  excluding  air¬ 
craft  such  as  defensive  fighter  interceptors  and  combat  aircraft 
used  as  trainers.  These  aircraft,  they  asserted,  did  not  have  offen¬ 
sive  missions — they  did  not  support  ground  forces — therefore  they 
should  not  be  limited  by  the  treaty.  In  addition,  the  Soviets  had 
reassigned  500  land-based  aircraft  from  ground  to  naval  units, 
and  they  wanted  to  exclude  them  from  consideration  arguing  that 
the  treaty  did  not  apply  to  naval  forces.  These  aircraft  were  impor¬ 
tant  to  the  Soviet  High  Command  because  they  constituted  a 
counterbalance  to  NATO’s  carrier-based  aircraft,  which  were  not 
limited  by  the  treaty.  The  NATO  states  were  concerned  that  any 
treaty  exclusion  of  combat  aircraft  based  on  mission  would  sanc¬ 
tion  a  legal  hiding  place.  Further,  they  were  troubled  by  the  Sovi¬ 
ets’  reassigning  ground-based  combat  aircraft  to  naval  forces. 

What  would  limit  the  Soviet  military  from  simply  assigning  an 
increasing  number  of  aircraft  to  naval  forces?  Painting  a  fighter’s 
tail  and  wings  with  naval  unit  insignia,  NATO  negotiators  argued,

The  Treaty  and  the  Mission 


offered  little  evidence  that  the  fighter  would  not  be  used  for  offen¬ 
sive  operations  within  the  treaty  area.30 

The  issue  became  so  contentious  that  as  late  as  September 
1990,  Secretary  of  State  James  A.  Baker,  III,  commented  in  a  news 
interview  that  combat  aircraft  might  not  be  an  element  of  the 
treaty.  He  suggested  that  these  aircraft  might  become  a  consider¬ 
ation  for  subsequent  CFE  negotiations.  Secretary  Baker  and  For¬ 
eign  Minister  Eduard  Shevardnadze  met  in  New  York  City  in  late 
September  to  consider  the  final  items  of  the  treaty.  By  early  Octo¬ 
ber,  they  had  worked  out  a  compromise  agreement  on  5,150  as  the 
total  number  of  combat  aircraft  a  single  country  could  possess  in 
the  treaty  area.  This  ceiling  reflected  the  Soviet  High  Command’s 
minimum  needs.  Concurrently  with  the  Baker  and  Shevardnadze 
discussions  in  New  York  City,  NATO’s  High  Level  Task  Force 
continued  to  review  the  issue  in  Brussels.  Once  Baker  and 
Shevardnadze  had  reached  an  agreement,  they  presented  it  to  each 
group  of  states.  In  Vienna,  after  treaty  negotiators  approved  the 
single-nation  limit,  they  moved  forward  on  October  15,  1990,  to 
agree  on  a  ceiling  of  6,800  combat  aircraft  per  group  of  state 
parties.31 

This  6,800  combat  aircraft  limit  left  the  Eastern  group  of 
states  with  a  900  aircraft  advantage.  However,  the  new  limits 
meant  that  the  Soviet  Armed  Forces  would  have  to  eliminate  1,295 
aircraft,  and  the  remaining  members  of  its  group  of  states,  277 
aircraft.  The  treaty  limits  included  interceptor  aircraft  and  Soviet 
Backfire  bombers.  Mission  was  not  the  basis  for  inclusion.  Treaty 
limits  excluded  primary  flight  training  aircraft,  whereas  combat 
aircraft  trainers  were  included  because  of  their  offensive  capabili¬ 
ties.  The  inclusion  of  combat  aircraft  trainers  affected  the  Eastern 
group  of  states’  totals,  primarily  the  Soviet  Union’s.  The  NATO 
states,  however,  were  not  affected  because  their  holdings  were 
approximately  900  aircraft  below  the  treaty  ceiling.  To  compen¬ 
sate  the  Eastern  group  for  agreeing  to  the  lower  combat  aircraft 
ceiling,  the  NATO  negotiators  acceded  to  a  treaty  provision  that 
allowed  the  reclassification  of  up  to  550  unarmed  training  aircraft. 
Seven  models  of  combat  training  aircraft  could  be  reclassified.  Key 
systems  could  be  removed  to  render  the  aircraft  useless  for  offen¬ 
sive  operations.  Reclassification  of  the  MiG-25U  fighters  was 
limited  to  130  aircraft.  Once  modified  and  certified  by  on-site 
inspectors,  these  reclassified  aircraft  would  not  count  against  the 
6,800  aircraft  ceiling. 

In  the  final  negotiations,  the  Soviet  delegates  were  adamant 
on  the  issue  of  excluding  their  land-based  naval  aircraft  from 
consideration.  Ultimately,  negotiators  could  not  resolve  the  prob¬ 
lem  within  the  structure  of  the  legally  binding  treaty.  Instead,  they 
inserted  into  the  treaty  a  political  declaration  that  allowed  each 
group  of  states,  although  in  reality  it  applied  only  to  the  Soviet

Union,  to  possess  a  certain  number  of  land-based  naval  aircraft 
that  did  not  count  against  the  6,800  ceiling  for  combat  aircraft. 

The  CFE  Treaty  did  contain  some  limits,  however.  The  total 
number  of  land-based  naval  aircraft  was  limited  to  430  per  group 
of  states,  with  no  nation  allowed  more  than  400.  This  declaration 
recognized  the  initial  Soviet  advantage  in  combat  aircraft  going  into 
treaty  negotiations,  but  it  limited  the  number  of  Soviet  land-based 
naval  aircraft  to  400,  and,  most  important,  it  sealed  for  the  future 
the  issue  of  combat  aircraft  being  assigned  to  naval  forces  and  being 
outside  the  treaty.  Naval  combat  aircraft  did  not  present  the  only 
unresolved  issue  as  the  time  for  treaty  signature  approached.  The 
complex  issue  of  setting  and  verifying  limits  on  national  military 
personnel  could  not  be  solved  in  the  weeks  leading  up  to  treaty 
signature,  and  produced  another  treaty  declaration. 

By  inserting  this  second  declaration  into  the  CFE  Treaty, 
negotiators  stated  that  limits  on  national  military  personnel  were 
an  aspect  of  the  CFE  Treaty,  but  that  such  limits  required  further 
negotiations  to  reach  agreement  on  specific  figures  and  verification 
protocols.32  Verification  was  the  major  stumbling  point.  U.S.  nego¬ 
tiators  believed  that  while  counting  CFE  military  equipment  would 
be  challenging,  counting  military  personnel  could  become  impos¬ 
sible,  particularly  during  periods  of  extensive  military  reorganiza¬ 
tions,  massive  force  reductions,  and  especially  during  rapid  mili¬ 
tary  expansions.  There  were  other  difficult  issues  associated  with 
tracking  military  manpower.  Just  who  would  be  counted:  military 
reserves?  naval  infantry?  military  transients?  In  the  end,  negotia¬ 
tors  agreed  to  continue  manpower  negotiations  with  a  goal  of 
reaching  agreement  by  the  Conference  on  Security  and  Coopera¬ 
tion  in  Europe  to  be  held  in  Helsinki  in  July  1992. 33  Consequently, 
they  included  in  this  second  CFE  Treaty  declaration  a  statement 
that  all  signatory  states  would  not  increase  their  current  levels  of 
peacetime  personnel.  Germany  was  the  only  state  that  made  a 
treaty  declaration  to  limit  its  military  forces.  Its  pledge  to  limit  its 
military  forces  to  not  more  than  370,000  constituted  the  third 
declaration  of  the  CFE  Treaty.34 

Scope 

The  scope  of  the  treaty  in  terms  of  nations,  military  equip¬ 
ment,  and  geography  was  enormous.  In  November  1990,  22  na¬ 
tions  with  military  forces  stationed  over  2.3  million  square  miles 
had  committed  themselves  to  the  CFE  Treaty.  The  TLE  fell  into 
five  major  categories:  tanks,  combat  aircraft,  attack  helicopters, 
armored  combat  vehicles,  and  artillery.  Further,  in  each  of  those 
categories  there  were  many  types  of  equipment:  24  types  of  tanks, 
55  types  of  combat  aircraft,  17  types  of  attack  helicopters,  and 
more  than  50  types  of  armored  combat  vehicles  (ACVs).  Armored 
combat  vehicles,  a  term  coined  for  the  treaty,  grouped  armored 


19 


The  Treaty  and  the  Mission 


personnel  carriers  (APCs),  armored  infantry  fighting  vehicles 
(AIFVs),  and  heavy  armament  combat  vehicles  into  a  single  cat¬ 
egory.  Heavy  armament  combat  vehicles  included  vehicles  that 
were  not  tanks,  APCs,  or  AIFVs  but  had  an  integral  gun  of  at  least 
75  millimeter  (mm)  caliber  and  weighed  at  least  6  tons.  Artillery 
included  guns,  howitzers,  mortars,  multiple  launch  rocket  systems, 
and  artillery  pieces  that  combined  the  characteristics  of  guns  and 
howitzers.  There  were  more  than  100  types  of  artillery  and  all 
were  of  at  least  100mm  caliber.  The  five  categories  of  TLE  con¬ 
tained  more  than  240  different  types  of  equipment.  The  combined 
holdings  of  TLE  for  both  groups  of  states  surpassed  200,000 
pieces. 

The  treaty  also  had  provisions  for  reporting  conventional 
armaments  and  equipment  that  were  inventoried  but  not  limited 
by  the  treaty.  The  Protocol  on  Existing  Types  of  Conventional 
Armaments  and  Equipment  listed  all  conventional  armaments  and 
equipment  subject  to  the  treaty.  Known  by  its  acronym,  CAEST, 
this  equipment  included  the  five  categories  of  TLE,  plus  combat 
support  helicopters,  unarmed  transport  helicopters,  and  Mi-24R 
and  Mi-24K  helicopters;  primary  trainer  aircraft;  armored-vehicle- 


launched  bridges;  and  armored  personnel  carrier  and  armored 
infantry  fighting  vehicle  “look-alikes.”  Armored  look-alikes  were 
vehicles  built  on  ACV  chassis  that  were  similar  in  appearance  to 
an  APC  or  an  AIFV,  except  that  they  could  not  transport  a  combat 
infantry  squad.  They  also  did  not  have  guns  or  cannons  of  20 
millimeter  (mm)  or  greater  caliber.  There  were  21  types  of  look-

alikes  for  the  M-113  APC  chassis  alone,  and  these  were  not  lim¬ 
ited  by  the  treaty.  In  deference  to  the  Geneva  Convention  of  1949, 
armored  ambulances  were  not  considered  ACVs  or  look-alikes 
under  the  CFE  Treaty.  Thus,  they  were  not  reportable. 

Armored  vehicle  launched  bridges  were  also  subject  to  the 
CFE  Treaty.  Although  they  were  not  considered  TLE,  limits  were 
placed  on  them.  The  treaty  allowed  each  group  of  states  to  have 
740  armored  bridges  in  use  with  their  active  forces.  Any  bridges  in 
excess  of  this  limit  had  to  remain  in  storage.  The  treaty  contained 
specific  guidelines  both  for  storing  them  and  for  removing  them 
during  an  emergency. 

In  the  first  official  treaty  information  exchange,  held  in 
Vienna  on  November  18,  1990,  the  22  nations  declared  an  aggre¬ 
gated  total  of  201,005  pieces  of  TLE.  By  category,  there  were 
58,282  tanks,  77,402  ACVs,  47,573  artillery,  14,311  aircraft,  and 
3,437  helicopters  within  the  treaty  area,  from  the  Atlantic  to  the 
Urals.''  By  November  1995,  the  total  number  of  TLE  within  the 
area  had  to  be  below  the  treaty  ceiling  of  157,600  pieces.  This 
final  figure  is  the  total  of  the  five  categories  of  offensive  weapons: 
40,000  battle  tanks,  60,000  armored  combat  vehicles,  40,000 
pieces  of  artillery,  13,600  combat  aircraft,  and  4,000  attack  heli¬ 
copters  (see  table  1-1).  These  totals  included  a  subtotal  designating 
the  maximum  amount  of  equipment  that  active  units  could  hold 
collectively,  with  the  remainder  stored  in  designated  permanent 
storage  sites.  These  maximum  equipment  figures,  again  one-half 
for  each  group  of  states,  permitted  active  units  to  hold  33,000 
tanks,  54,600  ACVs,  and  34,000  pieces  of  artillery. 

To  lessen  the  possibility  of  any  one  nation’s  becoming  too 
dominant  or  unilaterally  launching  a  massive  surprise  attack,  the 
treaty  stipulated  limits  on  the  amount  of  equipment  that  any  one 
nation  could  have  within  the  treaty  area.  Known  as  the  “suffi-

ciency  rule,”  this  provision  allowed  a  nation  sufficient  forces  to 
defend  itself,  but  limited  its  forces  and  offensive  equipment  to 
approximately  one-third  of  the  total  amount  permitted  for  its 
group  of  states.  As  the  Warsaw  Pact  disintegrated,  this  provision, 
which  was  originally  a  NATO  proposal,  took  on  an  additional 
importance  as  the  Central  European  nations  sought  to  minimize 
the  strength  of  the  neighboring  Soviet  Union. 

Area 

The  treaty’s  area  of  application  encompassed  the  territory  of 
the  European  signatory  nations  stretching  from  the  Atlantic  Ocean 
to  the  Ural  Mountains.  Known  as  the  ATTU  (Atlantic  to  the 
Urals),  the  area  consisted  of  four  zones,  three  of  which  were  con¬ 
centric  rings  centered  on  Germany,  and  one  that  defined  the  flanks 
of  a  European  theater  (see  map).  These  four  zones  defined  the 
areas  in  which  the  signatories  agreed  to  limit  the  number  of  TLE 
for  stationed  ground  forces.  Because  of  their  mobility  and  range, 
combat  aircraft  and  attack  helicopters  were  not  subject  to  zone 
restrictions.  The  smallest  zone  encircled  Central  Europe,  a  focal 
point  of  the  Cold  War.  It  encompassed  Germany,  Belgium,  Czech 
Republic,  Slovakia,  Hungary,  Luxembourg,  Netherlands,  Poland, 
and  designated  European  island  territories.  Military  forces  in  this 
zone  could  not  exceed  15,000  battle  tanks,  22,500  ACVs,  and 
10,000  pieces  of  artillery. 

The  next,  larger  concentric  zone  extended  beyond  Central 
Europe  and  included  additional  nations.  At  treaty  signature,  the 
second  zone  included  Denmark  and  the  Faroe  Islands,  France, 

Italy,  United  Kingdom  and  Northern  Ireland,  and  Soviet  territory 
encompassing  the  Byelorussian,  Carpathian,  Kiev,  and  Baltic  Mili¬ 
tary  Districts.  By  the  time  of  treaty  ratification  and  entry  into  force 
in  July  1992,  the  Soviet  Union  had  dissolved  and  these  military

districts  were  located  in  the  independent  states  of  Ukraine,  Russia, 
Belarus,  and  the  Baltic  nations.  Equipment  allowed  in  this  zone 
totaled  20,600  battle  tanks,  38,520  ACVs,  and  18,200  pieces  of 
artillery.  Put  another  way,  this  larger  zone,  which  included  the 
smaller  zone,  could  hold  the  equipment  authorized  in  the  smaller 
zone  plus  an  additional  5,600  battle  tanks,  16,020  ACVs,  and 
8,200  pieces  of  artillery. 

The  largest  of  the  three  zones  at  treaty  signature  encompassed 
the  two  smaller  zones  plus  Portugal  with  the  Azores  and  Madeira 
Islands,  Spain  and  the  Canary  Islands,  and  the  Soviet  territories 
west  of  the  Ural  mountains  encompassing  the  Moscow  and  Volga- 
Ural  Military  Districts.  When  the  treaty  entered  into  force,  this 
expanded  area,  which  stretched  literally  from  the  Atlantic  to  the 
Urals,  included  the  independent  states  of  Russia,  Ukraine,  Belarus, 
and  portions  of  Kazakstan.  This  zone  allowed  for  10,000  more 
battle  tanks,  9,680  more  ACVs,  and  9,800  pieces  of  artillery  for  a 
total  of  30,600,  48,200,  and  28,000  pieces  of  equipment  in  their 
respective  categories.  The  remaining  pieces  of  TLE  were  autho¬ 
rized  in  the  flank  areas. 

The  original  treaty  defined  the  flank  areas  as  Bulgaria, 

Greece,  Iceland,  Norway,  Romania,  Turkey  west  of  the  Urals,  and 
the  Soviet  territory  encompassing  the  Leningrad,  Odessa,  North¬ 
ern  Caucasus,  and  Transcaucasus  Military  Districts.  By  July  1992, 
when  the  treaty  entered  into  force,  portions  of  these  former  Soviet 
military  districts  were  located  in  the  new  nations  of  Moldova, 
Russia,  Georgia,  Armenia,  Ukraine,  and  Azerbaijan.  Other  por¬ 
tions  encompassed  the  three  Baltic  states  of  Estonia,  Latvia,  and

Although  the  Baltic  states  were  not  subject  to  inspection,  the  Rus¬ 
sian  forces  stationed  there  were,  and  Russia’s  reduction  liability 
included  the  equipment  not  yet  removed  from  the  Baltic  states. 

The  total  military  equipment  allowed  under  the  treaty  for  the 
flank  areas  was  9,400  battle  tanks,  11,800  ACVs,  and  12,000 
pieces  of  artillery. 

Reductions 

Two  of  the  CFE  Treaty’s  main  objectives  were  to  reduce  the 
possibility  of  a  surprise  attack  and  to  lower  the  probability  of 
confrontation  by  reducing  the  total  number  of  tanks,  artillery, 
ACVs,  attack  helicopters,  and  combat  aircraft  the  respective  group 
of  states  could  hold.  To  achieve  these  reductions,  the  treaty  set 
specific  schedules  for  reaching  the  final  limits.  As  implementation 
unfolded,  inspection  teams  monitored  the  pace  and  level  of  reduc¬ 
tion  efforts.  Inspections  became  important  benchmarks  for  mea¬ 
suring  treaty  compliance. 

During  the  initial  reduction  phase,  known  by  the  term  “first 
reduction  year,”  each  nation  had  to  reduce  25  percent  of  its  hold¬ 
ings  that  exceeded  treaty  limits  at  entry  into  force  (EIF).  The  initial 
reduction  phase  began  at  the  provisional  EIF  on  July  17,  1992, 
and  lasted  for  16  months.  It  encompassed  the  120-day  baseline 
inspection  period  followed  by  the  first  reduction  year.  A  second 
reduction  year  followed,  during  which  an  additional  35  percent 
of  the  excess  equipment  had  to  be  reduced.  Treaty  states  would

The  treaty  authorized  converting  tanks  and  ACVs  to  nonmilitary  equipment. 


reduce  the  remaining  40  percent  of  their  excess  equipment  during 
a  third  and  final  reduction  year.  This  schedule  gave  each  group  of 
states  40  months  to  reduce  all  their  weapons  in  excess  of  the  final 
treaty  limits. 

Article  VIII  of  the  CFE  Treaty  specified  the  methods  allowed 
to  reduce  TLE.  Reduction  methods  varied  by  equipment  category, 
although  destruction  and  placement  on  static  display  were  options 
common  to  all  categories  of  TLE.  Nations  could  also  convert 
tanks  and  ACVs  for  nonmilitary  purposes  or  use  them  as  training 
targets.  A  reduction  option  for  the  Soviet  MT-LB  armored  person¬ 
nel  carrier  was  modification  that  rendered  the  MT-LB  incapable  of 
transporting  a  squad  of  combat  infantrymen.  The  only  additional 
option  authorized  was  to  use  the  carriers  as  ground  targets.  Com¬ 
bat  aircraft  could  also  be  modified  for  ground  instructional  use, 
and  seven  specific  models  of  aircraft  could  be  modified  and  reclas¬ 
sified  as  unarmed  training  aircraft.  Helicopters,  attack  or  multi¬ 
purpose  attack,  could  be  modified  for  ground  instruction  pur¬ 
poses,  and  the  multipurpose  helicopters  could  also  be  modified 
and  recategorized  as  support  helicopters. 

The  Protocol  on  Reduction  provided  specific  guidance  on 
implementing  the  various  methods  of  reduction  listed  in  Article 
VIII.  Authorized  methods  for  destroying  TLE  included  cutting, 
exploding,  deforming,  and  smashing.  The  protocol  also  dictated 
the  specific  components  to  be  destroyed  for  each  category  of 
equipment  as  well  as  the  damage  required  to  render  a  piece  of  TLE 
permanently  ineffective  as  a  military  weapon.  The  protocol  dic¬ 
tated  the  results,  not  the  particular  technology  used  to  achieve 
them.  How  to  accomplish  a  cut  of  a  specific  length  in  a  specific 
location,  for  example,  was  an  option  of  the  state  reducing  the 
equipment.  It  was  not  necessary  to  destroy  the  entire  weapon  to 
achieve  reduction.  Unless  specified  in  the  reduction  protocol  as  a 
component  to  be  destroyed,  some  equipment,  such  as  communica¬ 
tion  systems,  could  be  salvaged  and  the  debris  scrapped.

The  Treaty  and  the  Mission 


For  aircraft,  the  fuselage  was  the  critical  component  for  a 
successful  reduction  by  destruction;  any  other  component  could  be 
salvaged.  The  first  of  the  two  authorized  destruction  methods  to 
reduce  an  aircraft  on  the  ground  was  severing,  which  required 
technicians  to  cut  the  nose  and  tail  sections  off  the  fuselage.  The 
other  option,  deformation,  required  technicians  to  compress  the 
fuselage  to  reduce  its  height,  length,  or  width  by  at  least  30  per¬ 
cent.  In  either  case  inspectors  would  have  specific  criteria  and 
tangible  evidence  of  an  aircraft  reduction.  Using  aircraft  as  target 
drones  was  an  additional  authorized  destruction  procedure  for 
aircraft.  Authorized  methods  of  helicopter  destruction  were  sever¬ 
ing,  explosive  demolition,  and  deformation.  The  fuselage  and  the 
transmission  mounting  area  were  the  key  components  for  a  suc¬ 
cessful  reduction,  and  specific  damage  criteria  were  outlined  for 
each  destruction  method. 

Destruction  methods  for  tanks  and  armored  combat  vehicles 
included  severing,  demolition,  and  smashing.  Also  allowed  were 
procedures  to  reduce  tanks  by  deformation,  including  welding  or 
severing  components  of  gun  systems  in  addition  to  deformation  of 
the  hull  and  turret.  The  critical  components  to  be  damaged  were 
gun  tubes,  breech  systems,  trunnions  and  their  mounts,  hulls, 
turrets,  and  integral  main  armament. 

Reducing  artillery  by  destruction  included  severing,  demoli¬ 
tion,  smashing,  and  deformation.  Specific  criteria  of  damage  were 
stipulated  for  components  critical  to  making  the  piece  of  equip¬ 
ment  a  weapon.  Those  components  were  the  tube,  breech  system, 
cradle  with  trunnion  and  mounts,  and  rails;  launcher  tubes  or  rails 
and  their  bases;  mortar  tubes  and  base  plates;  and  vehicle  hull  and 
turret  for  self-propelled  artillery  pieces. 


The  fuselage  was  the  key 
component  for  an  aircraft 
reduction,  either  by  deformation 
or  by  severing,  as  shown  on  this 
MiG-21  “Fishbed.” 


28 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


Severing  was  the  primary  reduction 
method  for  all  treaty-limited 
equipment  (TLE). 


While  destruction  was  the  most  common  option  selected  for 
reduction,  the  treaty  permitted  other  means  as  well.  States  owning 
the  equipment  were  allowed  to  put  it  to  use  as  something  other 
than  a  weapon.  Certain  tanks  and  ACVs  could  be  converted  to 
nonmilitary  equipment  such  as  bulldozers,  fire  fighting  equipment, 
and  rescue  vehicles.  Any  item  could  be  reduced  for  static  displays 
or  placed  in  military  museums.  Tanks,  ACVs,  and  artillery  could 
be  reduced  for  ground  targets,  and  aircraft  and  attack  helicopters 
could  be  reduced  for  ground  instruction  purposes.  The  key  con¬ 
cept  in  these  reductions  was  that  specific  components  required 
disabling  damage  before  certification  for  use  for  other  purposes. 
However,  the  number  of  items  that  could  be  reduced  using  these 
treaty  options  was  limited. 

Recategorization  presented  another  reduction  option,  such  as 
in  the  case  of  multipurpose  attack  helicopters.  By  treaty  definition, 
these  helicopters  performed  multiple  military  functions  and  em¬ 
ployed  guided  weapons.  By  removing  their  weapon  systems, 
mounting  points,  fire  control  systems,  and  wiring,  the  owning 
state  could  recategorize  these  helicopters  as  combat  support  heli¬ 
copters  not  limited  by  the  treaty.  Well  before  any  nations  began 
these  reductions,  however,  they  collected  and  exchanged  specific 
treaty  data  concerning  their  own  forces  and  equipment. 

Data  Exchange 

The  initial,  massive  CFE  Treaty  data  exchange  occurred  on 
November  18,  1990,  the  day  before  treaty  signature.  Freely  pro¬ 
vided,  this  data  exchange  listed  the  order  of  battle  for  every  signa¬ 
tory  nation’s  conventional  forces  stationed  on  the  European  conti¬ 
nent.  Experts  scrutinized  these  data  immediately,  and  they  became 
one  of  the  primary  sources  for  preparing  and  planning  treaty 
implementation.  Previously,  a  small  army  of  intelligence  officers 
would  have  been  necessary  to  gather  this  information;  now  signa¬ 
tory  nations  were  exchanging  these  data  as  part  of  their  initial 
treaty  obligation.  Article  XIII,  the  Protocol  on  Notification  and 
Exchange  of  Information,  and  its  Annex  on  the  Format  for  the 
Exchange  of  Information  required  each  signatory  party  to  provide 
all  other  parties  specific  information  on  the  status  of  its  forces. 

The  information  was  provided  in  six  charts. 


Chart  I  provided  the  command  structure  for  each  nation’s 
conventional  ground  and  air  forces  stationed  in  the  ATTU.  This 
chart  identified  each  unit  and  assigned  it  a  designator  used  in 
subsequent  charts.  Chart  I  also  indicated  the  next  two  higher 
echelons  in  the  unit’s  chain  of  command.  Charts  IIA  and  IIB  listed 
each  nation’s  total  holdings  of  TLE.  Chart  IIA  identified  a  state’s 
total  holdings  in  treaty-limited  tanks,  ACVs,  and  artillery.  It  also 
revealed  the  quantity  of  TLE  in  each  treaty  area  by  category,  sub¬ 
category,  and  type.  Chart  IIA  also  showed  TLE  in  designated

The  Treaty  and  the  Mission 


On  November  18,  1990,  all  CFE  nations  exchanged  detailed  information  on  their  military  forces. 


permanent  storage  sites  (DPSSs).  Chart  IIB  provided  the  same 
information  for  treaty-limited  aircraft  and  helicopters,  with  two 
exceptions.  There  was  no  reporting  by  treaty  zones  for  aircraft  and 
helicopters  nor  did  DPSSs  apply.  In  Charts  IIIA  and  IIIB,  states 
reported  all  of  their  conventional  armaments  and  equipment  sub¬ 
ject  to  the  treaty  (CAEST).  They  reported  not  only  those  units 
holding  TLE,  as  required  in  Chart  I,  but  also  those  holding  equip¬ 
ment  not  limited  but  nonetheless  subject  to  the  treaty,  including 
naval  units.  In  addition,  the  states  reported  all  DPPSs,  reduction 
sites,  and  locations  where  CAEST  were  routinely  present,  such  as 
repair  facilities  or  training  establishments.  Chart  IIIA  dealt  with 
ground  forces,  and  Chart  IIIB  covered  air  units.  Any  TLE  located 
in  the  ATTU,  but  not  in  service  with  a  state’s  conventional  armed 
forces,  was  reported  in  Chart  IV.  Also,  internal  security  military 
organizations  and  their  equipment  that  were  not  trained  for  com¬ 
bat  against  another  military  force  were  reported  on  Chart  IV. 
Equipment  being  refurbished  or  held  for  export — for  example, 
tanks  and  ACVs  that  had  been  reduced  or  were  awaiting  conver¬ 
sion — and  equipment  that  had  been  decommissioned  and  was 
awaiting  disposal  were  reported  on  Chart  IV. 

On  Chart  V,  states  reported  their  objects  of  verification 
(OOVs).  An  OOV  was  any  unit  at  the  brigade/regiment,  wing/air 
regiment,  independent  battalion/artillery  battalion  level,  indepen¬ 
dent  squadron,  or  equivalent  unit  holding  TLE.  Designated  perma¬ 
nent  storage  sites,  maintenance  units,  military  training  establish¬ 
ments,  and  airfields  where  TLE  was  permanently  or  frequently 
present  were  also  OOVs.  Reduction  sites  were  OOVs  as  well, 
because  of  the  excess  TLE  positioned  on  these  sites.  States  also 
reported  their  declared  sites  on  Chart  V. 

While  a  nation’s  total  number  of  OOVs  dictated  the  number 
of  inspections  it  was  liable  to  receive  during  the  various  phases 
of  the  treaty,  the  definition  of  a  declared  site  dictated  what  was 
inspectable.  A  declared  site  was  a  precisely  delineated  geographic 
location  containing  one  or  more  OOVs.  Examples  of  declared  sites 
were  specific  air  bases,  army  posts,  and  storage  depots  on  which

the  OOVs  were  located.  A  declared  site  included  all  territory 
within  its  natural  or  man-made  boundaries.  A  declared  site  also 
encompassed  areas  associated  with  the  operations  of  the  unit  that 
might  not  be  colocated,  such  as  a  railhead  or  a  training  area,  but 
where  CAEST  and  TLE  were  routinely  present.  For  example,  the 
36th  Fighter  Wing,  a  U.S.  OOV,  operated  from  a  declared  site,  the 
Bitburg  Air  Base  in  Bitburg,  Germany.  This  ratio  of  one  OOV  to 
one  declared  site  was  typical  of  most  U.S.  air  unit  OOVs,  but 
ground  units  frequently  colocated  OOVs  on  a  single  declared  site. 
For  instance,  three  OOVs — the  3rd  Battalion,  1st  Field  Artillery; 
82nd  Engineering  Battalion,  3rd  Engineering  Brigade;  and  2nd 
Battalion,  14th  Field  Artillery — operated  from  one  declared  site: 
Warner  Barracks  in  Bamberg,  Germany.  A  declared  site  containing 
multiple  OOVs  was  typical  for  the  national  militaries  of  the  East¬ 
ern  group  of  states.  Declared  sites  and  OOVs  were  critical  for 
treaty  implementation. 

Chart  V  listed  the  points  of  entry  (POEs)  associated  with  each 
declared  site.  Inspection  teams  entered  and  exited  the  inspected 
nation  through  the  specific  POEs  designated  for  each  declared  site. 
Chart  VI  provided  a  listing  of  all  designated  POEs,  categorized  by 
the  means  of  transportation  used  to  reach  them.  In  November 
1990,  Greece,  for  example,  reported  two  POEs  on  Chart  VI,  one 
at  Athens  International  Airport  for  air  arrivals  and  the  other  at  the 
Port  of  Piraeus  for  arrivals  by  sea.  The  Greek  government  desig¬ 
nated  both  POEs  as  acceptable  for  47  of  their  declared  sites,  while 
designating  only  one  POE  for  the  remaining  declared  sites. 

Treaty  Periods 

Negotiators  developed  the  treaty  so  that  implementation  took 
place  in  four  different  periods.  The  initial  120-day  baseline  valida¬ 
tion  period,  referred  to  as  the  CFE  Treaty  baseline,  was  expected 


CEE  Treaty  Periods 


31 


The  Treaty  and  the  Mission 


to  be  an  extremely  busy  period  for  inspection  teams.  During 
baseline  each  state  party  was  prepared  to  receive  inspections  at  a 
portion  of  its  declared  sites.  During  treaty  negotiations,  a  consen¬ 
sus  developed  that  there  were  too  many  declared  sites  to  inspect 
each  one  during  the  brief  baseline  period.  Consequently,  negotia¬ 
tors  agreed  that  it  was  not  necessary  to  inspect  each  site  to  deter¬ 
mine  if  a  nation  had  been  accurate  in  its  data  exchange.  They 
agreed  that  each  nation  would  be  liable  for  inspections  based  on 
20  percent  of  the  total  number  of  the  OOVs  declared  in  the  initial 
exchange  of  data.  These  baseline  inspections  would  occur  when 
the  amount  of  TLE  and  the  number  of  OOVs  would  probably  be 
at  their  highest  and  before  nations  could  complete  any  significant 
TLE  reductions.  On-site  inspections  during  baseline  allowed  states 
to  take  a  significant  sample  of  the  data  exchanged  to  determine  its 
accuracy  and  to  establish  a  base  for  planning  future  treaty  activities. 

The  second  period,  the  reduction  phase,  occurred  after  base¬ 
line,  when  the  pace  of  the  declared  site  inspections  slowed  to  a  rate 
of  10  percent  of  the  total  declared  OOVs  per  year.  This  rate  re¬ 
mained  in  effect  during  the  three  reduction  years.  During  those 
years,  inspectors  would  be  no  less  busy  because  of  the  requirement 
to  conduct  reduction  inspections.  After  these  initial  baseline  and 
reduction  periods,  the  third  phase  would  consist  of  a  120-day 
residual  level  validation  period.  During  this  phase,  states  would 
inspect  at  a  20  percent  rate  to  confirm  the  amount  of  equipment 
remaining  following  the  reductions.  On  completion  of  the  residual 
validation  period,  the  declared  site  inspections  would  be  con¬ 
ducted  at  a  rate  of  15  percent  of  each  state’s  OOVs  per  year  for 
the  duration  of  the  treaty,  known  as  the  residual  period. 


On-Site  Inspections 

Article  XIV  of  the  CFE  Treaty  allowed  each  state  to  verify 
compliance  with  all  provisions  of  the  treaty  by  giving  each  the 
right  to  conduct  inspections.  The  same  article  obligated  the  treaty 
states  to  accept  on-site  inspections.  Linder  the  CFE  Treaty  there 
were  four  types  of  on-site  inspections:  declared  site  inspections, 
challenge  inspections,  reduction  inspections,  and  certification 
inspections.  One  purpose  of  these  inspections  was  to  ascertain  if 
each  state  was  observing  the  numerical  limitations  on  TLE  located 
in  the  treaty  zones  and  the  flanks.  These  inspections  also  moni¬ 
tored  the  reduction  of  TLE,  the  certification  of  recategorized 
attack  helicopters,  and  the  reclassification  of  combat-capable 
training  aircraft.  Each  served  a  specific  purpose,  and  the  Protocol 
on  Inspections  outlined  procedures  for  conducting  each  type  of 
inspection. 

The  declared  site  inspection  was  a  critical  tool  for  confirming 
the  accuracy  of  exchanged  treaty  data.  In  theory  and  in  fact,  on¬ 
site  inspections  contributed  to  national  security  across  Europe. 


Types  of  Inspections: 

•  Declared  Site 

•  Challenge 

•  Reduction 

•  Certification 


32 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


The  status  of  each  state’s  forces  and  equipment  became  transpar¬ 
ent  to  other  states  through  inspection  team  reports  and  observa¬ 
tions.  An  inspected  state  could  not  refuse  a  declared  site  inspec¬ 
tion.  It  was  a  legal  obligation  under  the  treaty.  Over  the  life  of  the 
treaty,  the  hundreds,  indeed  thousands,  of  on-site  inspections 
allowed  each  state  to  conclude  that  other  states  were  fulfilling 
their  legal  obligations  and  complying  with  the  treaty’s  require¬ 
ments.  This  important  conclusion  could,  when  combined  with 
other  information,  lead  to  a  new  level  of  trust  and  confidence 
across  national  borders.  Allowing  treaty  inspectors  on-site  was  one 
key  to  developing  and  maintaining  successful  relationships  among 
the  signatory  nations. 


Negotiators  recognized  that  nations  could  not  rely  solely  on 
the  declared  site  inspections  to  monitor  compliance  with  treaty 
procedures.  Article  XV  addressed  their  right  to  use  national  tech¬ 
nical  means  such  as  satellites  or  reconnaissance  aircraft  to  monitor 
treaty  compliance.  That  article  also  prohibited  the  concealment  of 
equipment  to  circumvent  reconnaissance  efforts.  Negotiators  also 
realized  that  to  maintain  a  spirit  of  openness  and  cooperation, 
nations  would  have  to  open  all  of  their  territory  to  inspections, 
not  just  the  sites  where  they  had  declared  conventional  military 
equipment. 


Challenge  inspections  allowed 
teams  to  inspect  for  the  presence 
of  TLE  in  areas  other  than 
declared  sites. 


Challenge  inspections  gave  participating  nations  the  right  to 
inspect  a  specific  and  limited  area  other  than  declared  sites  in  any 
signatory  nation  within  the  ATTU.  This  inspection  right  increased 
the  likelihood  of  detecting  weapons  at  sites  not  de¬ 
clared  in  the  exchanged  data.  As  in  declared  site  inspec¬ 
tions,  quotas  were  applied  to  challenge  inspections. 
Starting  the  day  the  treaty  entered  into  force  and  con¬ 
tinuing  through  the  residual  level  validation  period, 
challenge  inspections  operated  within  a  quota.  It  was 
not  more  than  15  percent  of  a  state’s  declared  site 
inspection  obligations.  That  quota  increased  to  23 
percent  over  the  subsequent  life  of  the  treaty.  The  pro¬ 
cedures  for  challenge  inspections  were  similar  to  those 
in  declared  site  inspections,  but  there  were  differences. 


In  a  challenge  inspection,  the  inspection  team 
provided  a  geographic  description  of  the  specified  area, 
delineating  the  boundaries  of  the  area  it  wanted  to 
inspect.  By  comparison,  in  a  declared  site  inspection, 
the  inspected  party  declared  its  site  and  the  treaty  de¬ 
fined  the  site.  A  challenge  inspection  team,  however, 
could  request  any  location  within  a  country,  excluding 
declared  sites.  There  was  a  limit  to  the  size  of  the  in¬ 
spection  area,  namely,  65  square  kilometers  and  no 
more  than  16  kilometers  between  any  two  points 
within  the  area. 


33 


The  Treaty  and  the  Mission 


The  major  difference  in  a  challenge  inspection,  however,  was 
not  area  size,  but  the  fact  that  the  inspecting  state  could  only 
request  an  inspection.  The  inspected  state  could  refuse  or  accept 
the  inspection  within  two  hours  after  the  inspection  challenge  was 
issued  for  a  specified  area.  This  was  a  critical  right  for  any  state 
in  that  it  protected  each  state  from  inspection  by  another  whose 
intent  might  not  be  associated  with  the  CFE  Treaty.  An  inspected 
state  could  refuse  a  challenge  inspection  request  for  reasons  of 
safety  or  security.  If  the  inspected  state  refused  a  challenge  inspec¬ 
tion  request,  however,  it  was  obliged  to  assure  the  requesting  state 
that  there  was  no  TLE  in  the  specified  area,  a  difficult  task  if 
reconnaissance  photography  indicated  TLE  present  at  that  site.  If 
the  inspected  state  held  TLE  assigned  to  peacetime  internal  secu¬ 
rity  forces  within  the  specified  area,  it  had  to  allow  visual  confir¬ 
mation  of  the  TLE  present.  Following  a  refusal,  the  inspection 
team  could  designate  another  challenge  or  declared  site  inspection. 
A  refusal  of  the  inspection  did  not  reduce  inspection  quotas. 

Surprise  was  a  key  element  for  both  the  declared  site  and 
challenge  inspections.  Treaty  provisions  dictated  specific  timelines 
for  different  actions  during  each  inspection.  As  a  consequence,  an 
inspected  state  had  very  little  time  to  move  or  reposition  TLE.  The 
treaty’s  Protocol  on  Inspection  stipulated  that  an  inspecting  state 
had  to  provide  only  36  hours’  notice  prior  to  an  inspection  team’s 
arrival  at  the  point  of  entry.  After  their  arrival,  the  inspection  team 


Inspection  teams  moved  quickly — within  nine  hours  after  declaring  the  site  to  be  inspected.

On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


Safety  briefings  were  particularly 
important  at  sites  with  rough 
terrain,  harsh  climate,  and  aging 
facilities. 


had  from  1  to  16  hours  to  announce  which  declared  site  or  speci¬ 
fied  area  it  intended  to  inspect.  Following  that  announcement,  the 
treaty  required  the  inspected  state  to  expeditiously  transport  the 
inspection  team  to  the  declared  site.  Nine  hours  was  normally  the 
maximum  time  to  transport  the  inspection  team  to  the  site.  In 
mountains  or  difficult  terrain,  the  treaty  permitted  a  15-hour 
travel  time  to  the  site,  but  only  9  of  those  hours  counted  against 
the  inspection  team’s  time  in  country.  Regardless  of  whether  the 
permitted  travel  time  was  9  or  15  hours,  the  treaty  allowed  the 
inspected  state  6  hours  to  prepare  the  site  for  inspection. 

Upon  arrival  at  a  declared  site,  the  inspected  state’s  escort 
team  ushered  the  inspection  team  to  a  briefing  facility,  where 
escorts  presented  a  site  diagram  to  the  inspection  team.  The  site 
diagram  showed  the  perimeter  of  the  declared  site,  the  boundaries 
of  all  OOVs  on  the  site,  major  buildings  and  roadways,  entrances 
to  the  declared  site,  and  the  location  of  an  administrative  area 
designated  for  the  inspection  team’s  use.  Within  30  minutes  of 
receiving  the  site  diagram,  the  inspection  team  had  to  declare  the 
OOV  they  would  be  inspecting. 

Once  the  team  chief  announced  the  OOV  for  inspection,  the 
inspected  party  gave  a  preinspection  site  briefing  that  “should” 
not  last  more  than  one  hour.  This  briefing  was  important  because 
it  could,  and  often  did,  set  the  tone  for  the  entire  inspection.  In¬ 
cluded  in  this  briefing  was  information  on  local  safety  and  admin¬ 
istrative  procedures,  communications  and  transportation  systems, 
and  holdings  and  locations  of  all  CAEST  on  the  site,  including 
CAEST  in  any  common  areas.  A  common  area  was  any  area  on 
the  site  that  was  not  a  part  of  an  OOV,  such  as  a  parade  ground, 
administrative  facilities,  equipment  parking  areas,  and  training 
areas.  If  the  amount  of  TLE  briefed  varied  from  the  most  recent 
notification  given  by  the  inspected  state,  the  inspected  party  was  to

provide  explanations  for  the  differences.  Explanations  would 
include  information  on  where  the  additional  equipment  came 
from,  when  it  arrived,  how  long  it  would  be  there,  and  the  loca¬ 
tion  of  any  temporarily  absent  equipment.  The  time  from  notifica¬ 
tion  to  the  beginning  of  the  actual  inspection  could  be  as  short  as 
44  hours:  36  hours’  notification,  1  hour  at  the  POE  prior  to  the 
site  declaration,  6  hours’  minimum  time  to  prepare  the  site,  and 
the  1-hour  preinspection  briefing.  For  challenge  inspections  the 
timeline  was  similar,  except  that  the  inspected  nation  had  two 
hours  to  decide  if  it  would  accept  the  inspection.  In  theory  and  in 
fact,  these  treaty-mandated  timelines  left  very  little  time  to  move 
or  conceal  large  quantities  of  military  forces  or  equipment. 

While  the  declared  site  and  challenge  inspections  confirmed 
the  presence  or  absence  of  TLE,  the  reduction  inspection  allowed 
states  to  monitor  the  reduction  of  TLE  excess  to  the  treaty  limits. 
There  were  no  quotas  for  reduction  inspections  because  all  reduc¬ 
tions  were  open  to  inspection.  There  was  no  right  of  refusal.  Each 
state  scheduled  and  conducted  its  reductions  in  periods  that  lasted 
for  at  least  30  days,  but  no  longer  than  90  days.  These  announced 
calendar  reporting  periods  were  not  accountable  schedules;  in¬ 
stead,  they  reflected  the  reduction  goals  of  a  state  for  that  period. 
The  notification  of  a  calendar  reporting  period,  given  not  less  than

15  days  before  reductions  began,  included  the 
reduction  site,  the  equipment  to  be  reduced,  the 
OOVs  that  had  possessed  the  hardware,  the 
reduction  methods  to  be  employed,  the  point  of 
entry  for  the  inspection  team,  and  the  last  day  for 
viewing  the  equipment  before  the  actual  reduc¬ 
tion  started. 

During  a  CFE  reduction,  inspectors  had  the 
right  to  remain  on-site  and  watch  the  entire 
process  throughout  the  announced  reduction 
period,  and  three  days  beyond  that  if  necessary.  If 
two  announced  reduction  periods  were  less  than 
four  days  apart,  inspectors  could  remain  on-site 
through  the  following  period  also.  While  inspec-

activity  during  a  calendar  practical  and  unnecessary  expense.  Typically,  an  inspection  team 

reporting  period.  arrived  at  the  site  at  the  beginning  of  the  reduction  period  and 

exercised  the  treaty  right  to  record  serial  numbers  or  to  place 
markings  on  the  equipment  announced  for  reduction.  The  team 
also  checked  equipment  serial  numbers  against  the  numbers  re¬ 
corded  in  a  site  logbook  maintained  by  the  reducing  state.  The 
inspection  team  might  then  view  reductions  of  one  or  two  pieces 
of  equipment.  An  inspector’s  interest,  however,  was  in  the  final 
results.  The  technology  or  techniques  employed  to  achieve  those 
results  were  more  concerns  for  Joint  Consultative  Group  (JCG) 
delegates  or  negotiators.  Usually,  the  inspection  team  departed  the 
site,  and  at  the  end  of  the  reduction  period,  that  team  or  a  different 
team  returned  to  confirm  that  the  reductions  met  treaty  require¬ 
ments.  At  that  time,  they  compared  equipment  serial  numbers,  or 
the  inspector-applied  markings,  on  the  reduced  components  against 
their  own  lists  or  against  the  site’s  reduction  log. 

The  final  inspection  type,  certification,  was  similar  to 
reduction  inspections  in  several  ways.  The  certification  inspection 
allowed  nations  to  certify  that  multipurpose  attack  helicopters  and 
combat-capable  aircraft  had  been  reconfigured  into  support  heli¬ 
copters  and  trainer  aircraft.  Inspectors  had  access  to  cockpits  and 
could  demand  the  removal  of  panels  to  confirm  that  certain  treaty- 
designated  offensive  weapons  systems  were  no  longer  present.  This 
inspection  protocol  required  at  least  a  15-day  notification  prior  to 
the  date  that  the  reconfigured  helicopters  would  be  available  for 
certification  by  the  inspection  teams.  There  was  no  right  of  refusal 
nor  quotas  for  these  certification  inspections. 

Liaison  Officer  Requirement 

As  a  consequence  of  the  Cold  War,  nations  of  the  NATO  and 
WTO  alliances  had  stationed  hundreds  of  thousands  of  their  mili¬ 
tary  personnel,  weapons,  and  facilities  on  military  sites  throughout 


37 


The  Treaty  and  the  Mission 


Europe.  The  United  States,  for  instance,  had  nearly  325,000  U.S. 
Army,  Air  Force,  and  Navy  personnel  deployed  throughout  Europe 
in  1990.  The  Soviet  Union  had  17  army  divisions  and  363,700 
military  personnel  stationed  in  East  Germany  and  another 
337,000  stationed  on  military  bases  in  the  other  Central  European 
countries.  Under  the  CFE  Treaty,  nations  that  stationed  conven¬ 
tional  forces  and  equipment  outside  their  own  state,  but  within  the 
ATTU,  were  considered  “stationing  states.”  Stationing  state  forces 
were  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  CFE  Treaty  and  to  inspection. 
The  treaty  recognized  the  sovereignty  of  a  stationing  state,  autho¬ 
rizing  it  to  escort  CFE  inspectors  during  an  inspection  of  its  forces. 
The  treaty  specifically  required  an  inspecting  state  to  notify  the 
stationing  state  as  well  as  the  “host  state”  of  an  impending  inspec¬ 
tion.  This  notification  gave  the  stationing  state  sufficient  time  to 
assemble  and  dispatch  an  escort  team  to  the  site,  as  a  host  state 
would  if  an  inspection  team  had  selected  one  of  its  declared  sites 
for  inspection.  Under  the  CFE  Treaty,  the  United  States  initially 
had  169  OOVs  that  were  subject  to  declared  site  inspections. 

A  significant  problem  for  the  United  States  was  that  U.S. 
European  forces,  equipment,  and  facilities  were  located  at  more 
than  1,500  sites  throughout  Europe.  Some  of  these  sites  contained 
sensitive  or  classified  programs.  Most  of  these  programs  were 
located  on  U.S.  military  sites,  but  a  number  had  been  placed  on 
military  bases  or  sites  owned  by  the  host  state.  Under  early  drafts 
of  the  treaty’s  inspection  protocol,  all  U.S.  stationed  forces  and 
facilities  were  subject  to  inspection.  Here  was  a  serious  issue  for 
the  United  States.  In  treaty  negotiations,  the  United  States  sup¬ 
ported  the  inclusion  of  a  comprehensive,  intrusive,  on-site  inspec-

tion  regime  for  monitoring  the  treaty,  but  at  the  same  time  it  rec¬ 
ognized  that  it  had  to  protect  classified  programs  and  facilities 
critical  to  combat  readiness  and  military  operations  of  the  U.S. 
forces  in  Europe.  To  resolve  this  dilemma,  the  Office  of  the  Secre¬ 
tary  of  Defense  directed  a  thorough  review  in  early  1990.  Out  of 
that  intensive  evaluation,  key  American  officials  concluded  that 
the  existing,  tabled  inspection  protocol  had  to  be  modified.36 

In  early  March  1990,  the  United  States  introduced  a  new 
NATO-endorsed  inspection  protocol.  It  provided  procedures  to 
deal  with  sensitive  points,  authorized  the  shrouding  of  non-TLE 
items,  and  inserted  a  two-meter  access  rule.  This  rule  preserved  the 
treaty  right  of  the  inspection  team  to  observe,  count,  and  record 
the  CFE  Treaty’s  TLE — tanks,  artillery,  APCs,  fighters,  and  attack 
helicopters — without  entering  and  inspecting  every  building,  bar¬ 
racks,  container,  and  shrouded  object.  Doors  to  buildings  could  be 
opened  for  visual  inspection,  but  inspectors  could  enter  only  when 
the  doors  exceeded  two  meters.  The  two-meter  rule  also  came  into 
play  when  dealing  with  shrouded  sensitive  items  or  containers.  If 
none  of  the  width,  length,  height,  or  diameter  measurements  of  a 
shrouded  item  or  container  exceeded  two  meters,  the  inspectors 
had  no  right  to  access  because  there  was  no  TLE  that  measured 
less  than  two  meters.  These  changes  were  discussed  and  approved 
by  the  treaty  negotiators  in  the  spring  and  summer  months  of 
1990.  They  were  incorporated  into  the  final  CFE  Treaty’s  inspec¬ 
tion  protocol.37

The  Treaty  and  the  Mission 


Another  critical  concept,  the  right  of  the  inspected  party  to 
declare  a  “sensitive  point,”  was  part  of  the  final  treaty.  Under  this 
concept  an  inspected  state  could  declare  equipment,  locations,  or 
structures  sensitive  to  its  security.  This  declaration  allowed  the 
inspected  state  to  delay,  limit,  or  deny  inspectors  access  to  or 
overflight  of  the  sensitive  point.  An  inspected  state  could  also 
shroud  a  sensitive  piece  of  equipment  while  still  providing  an 
inspection  team  access  to  a  facility.  Although  a  state  could  declare 
a  sensitive  point,  it  also  had  to  declare  whether  the  sensitive  point 
contained  any  TLE.  If  TLE  was  present,  the  escort  team  had  to 
either  display  the  equipment  or  take  steps  to  satisfy  the  inspection 
team  that  only  the  declared  amount  and  type  of  TLE  was 
present.38 

A  third,  significant  concept  developed  in  the  final  stages  of 
negotiations.  As  explained  previously,  the  United  States  had  mili¬ 
tary  units  and  equipment  that  were  not  subject  to  the  treaty  but 
were  located  on  host  states’  military  bases  and  facilities.  The 
United  States  wanted  its  trained,  treaty-knowledgeable  escort 
officers  to  be  present  at  inspections  in  host  states  to  protect  Ameri¬ 
can  rights  and  interests.  In  addition,  the  United  States  had  other 
forces  and  facilities  that  were  not  on  a  declared  site  of  any  state 
but  that  were  still  vulnerable  to  being  inspected  during  challenge

inspections  of  a  host  state  area.  Protecting  U.S.  rights  in  these 
situations  was  a  major  concern  for  the  U.S.  government.  In  the  last 
few  weeks  of  treaty  negotiations,  U.S.  representatives  developed  a 
new  provision  that  allowed  for  a  liaison  officer. 

This  concept  required  the  stationing  state  party,  prior  to  an 
inspection,  to  designate  a  liaison  officer  to  serve  on  the  host  state’s 
escort  team.  Liaison  officers  were  to  be  available  to  represent  their 
government  during  an  inspection  in  case  the  inspection  team  came 
upon  any  of  the  stationing  state’s  forces  or  facilities.  Because  the 
treaty  protocols  provided  little  guidance  on  how  to  carry  out  this 
liaison  function,  the  United  States  negotiated  bilateral  agreements 
with  the  host  states,  outlining  procedures  for  U.S.  liaison  and  host 
escort  officers  during  CFE  Treaty  inspections.  These  bilateral 
agreements  varied  from  nation  to  nation,  ranging  from  extensive 
interaction  in  Germany  to  minimal  contact  in  other  states.  To 
reinforce  the  liaison  officer  provision,  the  treaty  stipulated  that  a 
representative  of  a  stationing  state  must  be  present  for  an  inspec¬ 
tion  of  any  of  its  forces  or  facilities.

Initial  Preparations:  United 
States  and  the  NATO  Nations 


Secretary  of  Defense  Richard  B.  Cheney  speaking  at  NATO  Headquarters  following  the  first  meeting  of  NATO 
and  former  Warsaw  Pact  delegations  in  April  1992. 

On  May  29,  1990,  President  Bush  signed  National  Security 
Directive  41,  instructing  the  On-Site  Inspection  Agency 
(OSIA)  to  prepare  to  conduct  on-site  inspections  under 
the  CFE  Treaty.1  Simultaneously,  the  President  expanded  OSIA’s 
mission  by  directing  it  to  recruit,  train,  and  plan  for  conducting 
on-site  inspections  under  the  Chemical  Weapons  Convention,  the 
Strategic  Arms  Reductions  Treaty,  and  the  Nuclear  Testing  Trea¬ 
ties.  On-site  inspection  was  a  common  element  in  monitoring  and 
verifying  compliance  with  these  new  arms  control  treaties.  In 
December  1987  President  Reagan  had  signed  the  Intermediate- 
Range  Nuclear  Forces  (INF)  Treaty,  which  laid  the  groundwork 
for  future  arms  control  agreements.  “Trust  but  Verify,”  Reagan’s 
oft-repeated  phrase  for  characterizing  American  attitudes  toward 
arms  control  treaties  with  the  Soviet  Union,  remained  a  powerful 
policy  objective  throughout  all  treaty  negotiations  in  the  early 
1990s.2

On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


Ratification  and  entry  into  force  of  these  treaties  would  allow 
the  United  States  and  other  signatories  to  conduct  on-site  inspec¬ 
tions  at  military  and  industrial  sites  in  as  many  as  160  nations. 
Hundreds  of  different  weapon  systems  and  thousands  of  indi¬ 
vidual  weapons  would  be  subject  to  inspection.  With  inspection 
rights  came  escort  responsibilities.  Under  all  the  treaties,  the  U.S. 
government  assumed  an  obligation  to  escort  foreign  inspection 
teams  at  U.S.  sites  and  facilities.  Inspectors  and  escorts  with  exper¬ 
tise  on  these  divergent  treaties  and  their  weapon  systems  would  be 
drawn  from  many  different  fields:  conventional  arms,  strategic 
nuclear  arms,  chemical  weapons,  and  underground  nuclear  testing. 
In  addition,  the  demand  for  linguists  would  increase  in  response  to 
new  treaty  requirements.  The  On-Site  Inspection  Agency  would 
expand  significantly  to  fulfill  the  United  States’  obligations  under 
these  treaties.3 

In  fact,  the  expansion  began  in  1990.  President  Bush  signed 
three  major  arms  control  agreements:  new  protocols  for  the 
Threshold  Test  Ban  Treaty  (TTBT)  and  the  Peaceful  Nuclear  Ex¬ 
plosions  Treaty  (PNET)  with  the  USSR  on  June  1,  1990;  a  new 
agreement  on  the  Destruction  and  Non-Production  of  Chemical 
Weapons  with  the  USSR,  also  on  June  1,  1990;  and  the  Conven¬ 
tional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe  Treaty  (CFE)  with  20 
European  nations  and  Canada  on  November  19,  1990. 4 
On-site  inspection,  a  key  element  in  each  of  these  agree¬ 
ments,  provided  critical  information  for  verifying  that 
other  nations  were  complying  with  their  treaty  obligations. 
For  the  U.S.  government,  the  determination  of  treaty  com¬ 
pliance  rested  with  the  president.  In  1990,  President  Bush 
stated  his  administration’s  policy  in  his  annual  arms  con¬ 
trol  report  to  the  U.S.  Congress5: 

“Without  exception,  the  United  States  expects  me¬ 
ticulous  fulfillment  of  all  existing  and  future  arms  control 
agreements,  and  all  obligations  that  they  entail.  I  am  com¬ 
mitted  to  ensuring  that  there  is  scrupulous  compliance 
with  all  arms  control  agreements  and  related  undertakings. 
We  cannot  and  will  not  accept  any  lesser  standard.  Put 
simply,  arms  control  commitments  must  be  precisely  de¬ 
fined  and  scrupulously  observed.  Nothing  less  will  do.” 


The  On-Site  Inspection  Agency  prepared 
to  implement  several  other  treaties  and 
agreements,  such  as  the  Chemical  Weapons 
Convention. 


Defining  CFE  Treaty  Roles  and  Missions 

In  accordance  with  precedents  established  in  implementing 
the  INF  Treaty,  the  On-Site  Inspection  Agency  had  a  strictly  opera¬ 
tional  role  in  implementing  the  CFE  Treaty.  President  Bush,  in 
National  Security  Directive  41,  directed  Brigadier  General  Roland 
Fajoie,  Director  of  OSIA,  to  prepare  to  conduct  on-site  inspections 
under  the  CFE  Treaty.  In  that  same  May  1990  directive,  the  presi-

Initial  Preparations:  United  States  and  the  NATO  Nations 


dent  stipulated  that  the  secretary  of  defense  would  be  responsible 
for  ensuring  that  the  U.S.  government  was  in  compliance  with  all 
CFE  Treaty  provisions.6  After  considerable  debate  within  the 
Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff,  and 
the  military  services,  General  Colin  L.  Powell,  USA,  Chairman  of 
the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff,  recommended  to  Secretary  of  Defense 
Richard  B.  Cheney  in  April  1991  that  the  U.S.  Commander-in- 
Chief,  Europe  (USCINCEUR)  be  designated  the  Department  of 
Defense’s  (DoD)  executive  agent  for  treaty  implementation.  On 
June  14,  1991,  Secretary  Cheney  gave  General  John  R.  Galvin, 
USA,  USCINCEUR,  authority  to  task  all  DoD  forces  and  organi¬ 
zations  within  the  CFE  Treaty’s  area  of  application.  Responsibili¬ 
ties  of  the  executive  agent  included  developing  procedures  to 
monitor  the  status  of  U.S.  forces  and  equipment  subject  to  the 
treaty  and  reporting  periodically  on  that  status  to  the  Joint  Chiefs 
of  Staff.  In  addition,  the  executive  agent  was  to  ensure  that  all  U.S. 
forces  developed  and  carried  out  plans  to  receive  foreign  on-site 
inspectors.  The  plans  had  to  incorporate  provisions  to  protect 
sensitive  points  and  special  access  programs.  General  Galvin  and 
the  USCINCEUR  staff  would  supervise  the  transfer  of  U.S.  treaty- 
limited  equipment  (TLE)  to  allied  nations  under  the  NATO  Har¬ 
monization  Plan.  Finally,  he  was  responsible  for  any  treaty- 
required  reduction  of  U.S.  equipment. 


General  Galvin  directed  treaty  implementation  through  the 
U.S.  European  Command  and  three  subordinate  commands:  U.S. 
Army  Europe  (USAREUR),  U.S.  Air  Forces  in  Europe  (USAFE), 
and  U.S.  Navy  Europe  (USNAVEUR).  For  U.S.  forces  and  facilities 
stationed  in  the  Azores  and  in  Iceland,  which  were  subject  to  the 
CFE  Treaty  but  were  not  under  USCINCEUR’s  command,  the  U.S. 
Atlantic  Command  issued  directives  ordering  them  to  comply  with 
the  secretary  of  defense’s  memorandum.  To  define  the  roles,  mis¬ 
sions,  and  responsibilities  required  to  implement  the  CFE  Treaty, 
the  U.S.  European  Command,  the  U.S.  Atlantic  Command,  and 
OSIA  developed  a  joint  Memorandum  of  Understanding.8 

Essentially,  this  key  memorandum  delineated  the  responsibili¬ 
ties  for  training,  logistics,  and  inspection  operations.  It  tasked 
American  land,  air,  and  naval  forces  within  the  treaty’s  area  of 
application  to  plan  and  train  to  receive  on-site  inspections  by 
Eastern  group  inspection  teams.  The  memorandum  also  defined 
the  type  of  logistical  support  U.S.  military  units  and  site  com¬ 
manders  would  provide  for  the  inspection  teams,  specifically, 
security,  ground  transportation,  emergency  medical  care,  medical 
evacuation,  and  administrative  work  areas.  Site  commanders  were 
to  provide  meals  and  accommodations,  if  available  on  the  installa¬ 
tion,  for  the  inspection  and  escort  teams.  If  this  was  not  possible, 
then  that  responsibility  fell  to  OSIA.  U.S.  site  commanders  were  to 
facilitate  the  inspection  process  by  having  their  equipment  and 
facilities  ready  for  the  foreign  inspection  teams,  and  by  providing

Commander-in-Chief,  Europe.

helicopter  overflights  when  required.  They  would  also  designate 
sensitive  sites  to  the  OSIA  personnel  escorting  the  on-site  inspec¬ 
tion  teams. 

Moreover,  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  required  that 
OSIA  assist  military  commanders  in  training  site  personnel  and 
evaluating  their  site  preparations.  The  memorandum  explicitly 
stated  that  the  OSIA  escort  team  chief  represented  the  U.S.  govern¬ 
ment  in  all  treaty-related  matters  during  inspections.  A  related 
provision  required  that  OSIA  provide  liaison  officers  to  meet 
arriving  inspection  teams  at  the  designated  points  of  entry  and 
during  the  inspection  to  maintain  continuous  communications 
with  the  U.S.  European  Command.  Finally,  the  memorandum 
stipulated  that  the  U.S.  Atlantic  Command  would  provide  the 
necessary  logistical  and  operational  support  for  U.S.  military 
facilities  subject  to  inspection  in  Iceland  and  the  Azores.9 


Several  aspects  of  this  memorandum  were  contentious.  For 
example,  the  U.S.  Army  Europe’s  position  on  feeding  and  housing 
inspection  teams  was  that  their  units  would  be  hard  pressed  to 
support  the  requirement.  Most  U.S.  Army  units  in  Europe,  they 
maintained,  did  not  have  adequate  facilities  to  house  inspection  and 
escort  teams.  Feeding  the  teams  would  be  difficult,  unless  they  ate 
during  regular  meal  hours  in  the  dining  hall.  Since  the  chief  of  the 
inspection  team  set  the  schedule  for  the  conduct  of  the  inspection, 
teams  often  took  their  meals  very  late,  after  dark,  or  very  early, 
before  first  light.  Therefore,  General  Crosbie  E.  Saint,  USA, 
USAREUR  Commander-in-Chief,  recommended  that  OSIA  be 
responsible  for  providing  housing  and  food  for  the  inspection  and 
escort  teams.  The  new  director  of  OSIA,  Major  General  Robert  W. 
Parker,  USAF,  countered  that  the  agency  had  no  housing  or  messing 
facilities,  and  that  the  U.S.  Army  personnel  at  each  site  knew  the 
surrounding  area  better  than  did  OSIA  escort  or  liaison  teams.10 


It  took  many  months  to  resolve  this  dispute  of  defining  re¬ 
sponsibilities  for  the  support  mission.  While  USAREUR  and  OSIA 
ironed  out  these  support  issues,  the  first  order  of  business  for 
OSIA  was  to  evaluate  the  inspection/escort  mission:  just  how 
many  people,  teams,  and  support  personnel  would  it  take  to  con¬ 
duct  and  escort  on-site  inspections  under  the  CFE  Treaty? 


OSIA:  Sizing  the  CFE  Treaty  Mission 

To  implement  the  INF  Treaty,  OSIA  set  up  a  small  field  office 
in  1988  at  Rhein-Main  Air  Base  in  Frankfurt,  Germany.  This 
office  became  the  gateway  for  U.S.  teams  conducting  on-site  in¬ 
spections  of  Soviet  INF  missile  sites  located  in  the  western  USSR. 
Inspection  teams  originated  in  Washington,  D.C.,  flew  to  Germany 
where  they  received  inspection  equipment  and  briefings,  and  then 
proceeded  to  Moscow,  the  point  of  entry  for  INF  Treaty  inspec-

tions.  On  completion  of  their  inspection  missions,  the  American 
teams  returned  to  Germany,  turned  in  their  inspection  equipment, 
and  flew  back  to  the  United  States.  The  personnel  assigned  to 
OSIA’s  Rhein-Main  office  also  escorted  Soviet  teams  inspecting 
U.S.  INF  missile  sites  in  Europe.  From  1988  through  1991,  this 
small  office  assisted  in  more  than  200  INF  Treaty  inspection  and 
escort  missions.  With  the  CFE  Treaty,  OSIA’s  Field  Office,  Europe51' 
assumed  a  far  larger  and  more  significant  role.11 

All  CFE  Treaty  inspection,  escort,  and  liaison  operations 
would  originate  from  this  field  office.  It  would  also  manage  all 
gateway  activities  in  support  of  the  INF  Treaty,  the  Threshold  Test 
Ban  Treaty,  and  the  Strategic  Arms  Reduction  Treaty.  Three  expe¬ 
rienced  senior  officers,  Colonel  Frederick  E.  Grosick,  USAF,  Chief 
of  the  Field  Office,  Europe;  Ft.  Colonel  Paul  H.  Nelson,  USA;  and 
Ft.  Colonel  Thomas  S.  Brock,  USA,  former  INF  inspection  team 
chiefs  and  current  headquarters  planners,  began  in  the  spring  of 
1990  to  examine  treaty  requirements  to  determine  manpower 
needs.  In  May  1990,  20  people  were  assigned  to  OSIA’s  European 
Operations  Command,  to  support  the  INF  Treaty  mission.  This 
number  would  increase  to  more  than  127  by  July  1992,  when  the 
CFE  Treaty  entered  into  force.  Initially,  projections  for  this  sixfold 
increase  had  been  much  greater.  In  January  1990,  a  key  headquar¬ 
ters  planner,  Commander  Edward  J.  Higgins,  USN,  had  projected 
that  the  agency  would  need  159  people  in  Frankfurt  and  49  in 


*The  European  component  of  the  On-Site  Inspection  Agency  underwent  several 
redesignations  over  the  years.  In  1988,  OSIA’s  detachment  at  Rhein-Main  Air  Base 
was  called  the  Field  Office,  Europe.  On  December  1,  1990,  it  was  made  a  stand-alone 
directorate  and  redesignated  as  OSIA-Europe.  On  9  March  1992,  another  reorganization 
of  OSIA  gave  this  directorate  status  as  a  command,  and  it  was  renamed  the  European 
Operations  Command.  Throughout  this  history,  the  designation  of  European  Operations 
Command  will  be  used.

erations  center  personnel.  Senior  DoD  policy  and  acquisition  com¬ 
mittees  reviewed  and  approved  OSIA’s  manpower  projections.12 

Later,  some  of  Commander  Higgins’s  assumptions  proved  to 
be  incorrect.  This  was  understandable,  since  they  had  been  formu¬ 
lated  in  January  1990,  nearly  10  months  before  the  treaty  was 
signed  and  two-and-a-half  years  before  it  entered  into  force.  One 
assumption  concerned  the  size  of  inspection  teams.  The  INF

Treaty  provided  an  early  planning  model  for  a  10-person  team; 
negotiators  for  the  CFE  Treaty,  however,  agreed  to  a  maximum  of 
only  9  inspectors  per  team.  This  treaty  change  lowered  manning 
projections.  Another  change  came  when  Colonel  Lawrence  G. 
Kelley,  USMC,  OSIA  European  Operations  Command’s  new  Chief 
of  Operations,  redefined  what  constituted  a  “qualified”  inspection 
team.  Under  the  INF  Treaty,  teams  qualified  either  as  escorts  or 
inspectors,  and  during  treaty  operations  they  operated  exclusively 
in  that  role.  Under  the  CFE  Treaty,  Kelley  directed  that  all  OSIA 
CFE  Treaty  teams  would  be  dual  qualified:  capable  of  conducting 
both  inspections  and  escorts.  This  redefinition  further  reduced  the 
manning  projections  for  the  number  of  OSIA  CFE  Treaty  teams, 
inspectors,  and  escorts.13 

There  were  other  changes  as  well.  Perhaps  the  most  decisive 
change  came  in  the  projected  number  of  CFE  Treaty  baseline 
inspections  that  the  U.S.  would  conduct.  American  planners  antici¬ 
pated  that  the  level  of  inspection  activity  would  be  at  its  zenith 
during  baseline,  the  treaty’s  first  120  days.  This  assumption  was 
decisive  in  determining  manning  authorizations.  Two  factors  af¬ 
fected  all  U.S.  projections  for  baseline  inspections:  the  number  of 
inspections  to  be  conducted  by  the  NATO  states,  and  the  United 
States’  portion  of  the  NATO  inspections. 

During  October-November  1990,  the  number  of  inspections 
to  be  conducted  by  the  NATO  states  decreased  significantly  from 
previous  projections.  Two  events  contributed:  Germany’s  unifica¬ 
tion  in  October  1990,  and  the  Soviet  Union’s  first  official  treaty

data  exchange.  In  the  first  event,  East  Germany’s  CFE  Treaty 
sites — the  designated  military  bases,  depots,  and  installations — 
became  German  sites.  NATO  allies  had  agreed  that  there  would  be 
no  inspections  within  the  alliance.  Further,  the  NATO  states 
agreed  that  following  unification,  only  Germany  would  inspect 
Soviet  forces  still  stationed  on  the  territory  of  the  former  East 
Germany.14 


NATO  states  agreed  that  there 
would  be  no  inspections  within 
the  alliance. 


Second,  there  was  a  decrease  in  the  total  of  Soviet  CFE  Treaty 
objects  of  verification  (OOVs).  At  treaty  signature,  the  Soviet 
Union  exchanged  data  that  indicated  one-third  fewer  OOVs  sub¬ 
ject  to  inspection  than  their  senior  representatives  had  disclosed 
during  treaty  negotiations.15  This  was  a  major  surprise  for  the 
NATO  states  despite  the  fact  that  in  the  two  months  before  treaty 
signature,  satellite  reconnaissance  had  revealed  that  the  Soviet 
Army  was  moving  thousands  of  pieces  of  equipment  out  of  Cen¬ 
tral  Europe  to  areas  east  of  the  Ural  Mountains.16  Since  the  treaty 
was  not  yet  signed,  these  large-scale  redeployments  were  legal,  but 
they  raised  questions  of  treaty  circumvention.  In  addition  to  hav¬ 
ing  substantially  fewer  forces  and  equipment  in  the  treaty  zones 
and  flanks,  the  Soviet  High  Command  had  reassigned  some  forces 
to  naval  infantry  and  coastal  defense  units.  The  Soviets  interpreted 
the  treaty  as  not  applicable  to  naval  forces,  including  naval  infan¬ 
try.  The  Soviet  position  followed  that  there  was  no  obligation  to 
report  naval  forces  as  inspectable  units  under  the  CFE  Treaty. 
Treaty  experts  would  wrestle  over  these  Soviet  issues  for  months 
following  treaty  signature.1'  In  fact,  these  issues  became  so  conten¬ 
tious  that  they  delayed  ratification.  The  more  immediate  issue  for 
OSIA,  however,  was  how  to  revise  manning  projections.  In  order 
to  identify,  train,  and  relocate  people  to  Europe,  it  was  vital  to 
know  how  many  inspectors,  escorts,  and  support  personnel  would 
be  needed.  Clearly,  the  number  of  inspections  available  to  the 
NATO  states  had  decreased;  but  so  too  had  the  United  States’ 
proportion  of  those  inspections.18 

The  treaty  did  not  address  the  allocation  of  inspection  quotas 
within  each  group  of  states — that  process  rested  with  each  group. 
Under  the  CFE  Treaty,  each  Eastern  group  state  was  subject  to  a 
specific  number  of  inspections  per  treaty  period/1'  The  allocation 
of  inspections  among  the  NATO  allies  was  a  give-and-take  pro¬ 
cess.  A  Verification  Coordinating  Committee  (VCC)  handled  this 
allocation  process  at  Headquarters  NATO.  The  VCC  was  a  new 
organization,  established  in  1990  specifically  to  coordinate  the 
alliance’s  implementation  of  the  CFE  Treaty  and  the  Vienna  Docu¬ 
ment.14  Initial  U.S.  planning  had  American  inspection  teams  con¬ 
ducting  at  least  20  percent,  and  perhaps  as  many  as  50  percent,  of 


’Under  the  CFE  Treaty,  there  were  four  treaty  periods:  baseline,  reduction,  residual  level 
validation,  and  residual.

all  the  CFE  baseline  inspections  available  to  the  NATO  states.  This 
estimate  proved  too  high  because  most  of  the  other  NATO  nations 
asserted  their  treaty  rights  to  conduct  CFE  inspections.  After  con¬ 
siderable  internal  discussion  among  the  NATO  nations  and  within 
NATO’s  VCC  and  its  staff  to  determine  a  fair  share  of  the  inspec¬ 
tions,  the  committee  allotted  the  United  States  18  percent  of 
NATO’s  active  inspection  quota  for  the  CFE  baseline  period.20  As 
a  consequence  of  the  decrease  in  the  total  number  of  inspections  to 
be  conducted  by  the  NATO  states  and  the  decrease  in  the  United 
States’  portion  of  NATO’s  baseline  inspection  quota,  the  United 
States  reduced  its  projections  for  conducting  inspections  from  an 
estimated  60-150  to  approximately  44-45  inspections.  This  new 
figure  proved  to  be  quite  accurate.21 

As  discussed  in  the  next  chapter,  Ratification  Delayed,  the 
Soviet  movement  of  TLE  east  of  the  Urals  and  its  reassignment  of 
forces  to  the  naval  infantry  seriously  threatened  treaty  ratification 
and  entry  into  force.  Resolution  of  these  issues  required  seven 
months  of  negotiation  before  a  political-military-diplomatic  solu¬ 
tion  emerged  that  addressed  the  other  parties’  apprehensions.  In 
the  interim,  OSIA’s  European  Operations  Command  had  to  rede¬ 
fine  its  manpower  requirements  based  on  the  projected  figure  of 
44-45  baseline  inspections.  Ultimately,  the  command  was  autho¬ 
rized  112  people  to  conduct  the  CFE  Treaty’s  baseline  period.  This 
authorization  specified  15  team  chiefs  and  deputies,  18  linguists, 
14  weapons  specialists,  and  65  other  personnel  responsible  for 
planning,  communications,  logistics,  transportation,  command 
and  control,  and  administration.  From  this  number,  the  United 
States  would  man,  equip,  and  train  seven  complete  CFE  Treaty 
inspection  teams  and  one  partial  team.22 


The  VCC  coordinated  the  NATO 
alliance’s  implementation  of  the 
CFE  Treaty  and  Vienna  Document. 


The  European  Context 

Massive  Military  Force  Withdrawals 

Two  events  profoundly  changed  the  military  context  of  the 
European  continent  as  preparations  for  implementing  the  CFE 
Treaty  were  under  way:  the  unification  of  Germany  and  the  col¬ 
lapse  of  the  Central  European  Communist  governments.  In  re¬ 
sponse  to  these  events,  Soviet  leaders  accelerated  the  massive  with¬ 
drawal  of  Soviet  military  forces  from  Central  Europe.  On  October 
1,  1990,  the  Soviet  Union  had  17  divisions  (363,700  military 
personnel)  stationed  in  East  Germany.  Organized  into  five  armies, 
the  Group  of  Soviet  Forces  in  Germany  (GSFG)  was  the  largest 
military  force  outside  the  USSR.  The  Soviets  withdrew  all  of  these 
armies,  along  with  another  337,000  Soviet  military  personnel 
stationed  in  the  Central  European  and  Baltic  nations,  over  a  five- 
year  period,  1989-94. 23  President  Bush,  in  turn,  ordered  substan-

The  deployment  of  thousands  of  pieces  of  equipment  to  the  Persian  Gulf  coincided  with  the  inactivation  of  U.S. 
units  in  Europe.

tial  withdrawals  of  U.S.  military  forces  stationed  in  Western 
Europe.  In  1990  the  U.S.  Army  Europe  had  217,000  military 
personnel;  three  years  later,  it  had  92, 200. 24 

Simultaneous  with  this  American  withdrawal,  the  U.S.  Army 
and  U.S.  Air  Force  deployed  a  substantial  number  of  their  Euro¬ 
pean  combat  units  to  the  Persian  Gulf  in  late  1990  in  support  of 
the  Gulf  War  deployment,  Desert  Shield.  Following  the  decisive 
coalition  victory  over  Iraq  in  February  1991,  many  of  these  Ameri¬ 
can  units  did  not  return  to  Europe  but  were  sent  to  garrisons  and 
training  bases  in  the  United  States.  Thus,  the  combination  of  the 
Soviet  Union’s  massive  force  withdrawal  and  the  United  States’ 
military  redeployments,  coupled  with  the  sudden  transfer  of  per¬ 
sonnel  and  materiel  to  the  Gulf,  caused  massive  troop  movements 
across  the  length  and  breadth  of  the  European  continent  during  20 
months  of  the  CFE  Treaty  preparations. 

General  Crosbie  E.  Saint,  Commander-in-Chief,  USAREUR, 
said  that  in  1992,  his  command  was  “averaging  500  soldiers  a  day 
leaving  Europe.”2-  In  1991-92,  General  Saint  inactivated  or  ro¬ 
tated  back  to  the  States  125  army  battalions.  Compared  with  1990 
strengths,  these  battalion  reductions  were  striking:  infantry  (54%), 
armor  (62%),  armored  cavalry  (50%),  field  artillery  (71%),  and 


_  Initial  Preparations:  United  States  and  the  NATO  Nations 


55 


air  defense  artillery  (48%).  USAREUR  inactivated  so  many  of  its 
sites  that  the  United  States  returned  157  installations,  mostly  in 
Germany,  to  their  European  host  nations.  Commanding  and  man¬ 
aging  this  American  withdrawal  was  a  time-consuming  effort  that 
demanded  detailed  planning.  At  one  point,  General  Saint  com¬ 
pared  a  battalion  leaving  a  German  caserne  to  painting  a  floor  in  a 
house.  “You  have  to  start  at  the  far  end  and  paint  yourself  out  the 
door.  But  the  ‘whole  system’  does  not  stop  until  you  are  out  the 
door.”26  Complicating  this  extraction  process  was  the  American 
military’s  practice  of  announcing  and  quickly  enforcing  field  grade 
officer  retirements,  and  accepting  voluntary  separations  from  all 
ranks  with  alacrity.  At  the  same  time,  General  Saint  demanded 
that  the  traditional  American  standards  of  combat  readiness  be 
maintained.  In  1992  he  had  every  USAREUR  infantry,  armor, 
attack  helicopter,  engineer,  and  air  defense  artillery  battalion  train 
in  a  force-on-force  battle  at  the  large  range  at  Hohenfels,  Ger¬ 
many.  “Soldiers  in  Europe,”  Saint  declared,  “don’t  have  time  to  sit 
around  feeling  sorry  for  themselves.  They  train;  and  when  they’re 
finished  with  that,  they  train  some  more.”2  The  combination  of 
USAREUR’s  maintaining  combat  readiness  and  managing  the 
substantial  force  withdrawal  meant  that  the  CFE  Treaty  prepara¬ 
tions,  especially  the  mock  inspections  at  U.S.  Army  installations, 
could  become  contentious.  At  OSIA’s  European  Operations  Com¬ 
mand,  the  American  commanders  responsible  for  preparing  in¬ 
spection  teams  for  implementing  the  CFE  Treaty  had  to  work  with 
the  U.S.  Army  and  Air  Force  in  Europe.  Those  American  forces 
would  be  subject  to  CFE  inspections;  they  needed  training  to  be 
ready.  Tensions  developed,  especially  during  1991-92  when  CFE 
Treaty  training  was  most  intense  and  when  the  U.S.  military  force 
reductions  were  at  full  flood.28 


Thousands  of  American  forces  in 
Europe  deployed  to  the  Persian 
Gulf  during  Operation  Desert 
Shield.  Most  did  not  return  to 
Europe  after  the  Gulf  War.

New  National  Verification  Agencies 

Even  before  the  CFE  Treaty  was  signed  in  November  1990, 
some  European  nations  had  begun  to  establish  their  treaty  verifica¬ 
tion  agencies.  Two  of  the  largest  CFE  Treaty  nations,  the  United 
States  and  the  Soviet  Union,  already  had  established  professional 
military  inspection  agencies.  The  INF  Treaty’s  extensive  on-site 
inspection  provisions  had  caused  both  nations  to  act;  the  United 
States  set  up  the  On-Site  Inspection  Agency,  and  the  USSR  estab¬ 
lished  the  Nuclear  Risk  Reduction  Center.  INF  Treaty  inspections 
began  in  July  1988,  and  the  U.S.  and  USSR  agencies  had  con¬ 
ducted  more  than  400  on-site  inspections  by  the  time  the  CFE 
Treaty  was  signed.  The  agencies  had  recruited,  trained,  tested, 
equipped,  and  deployed  hundreds  of  inspectors  and  dozens  of 
teams.  They  had  accumulated  experience  that  was  directly  trans¬ 
ferable  to  implementing  the  CFE  Treaty. 

Germany,  Great  Britain,  France,  Belgium,  the  Netherlands, 
Italy,  Spain,  Canada,  Luxembourg,  and  the  other  CFE  Treaty 
signatories  had  had  only  limited  experience  with  on-site  inspec¬ 
tions.  The  Stockholm  Document  of  1986,  a  product  of  the 
Helsinki  Process,  was  the  earliest  modern  European  agreement 
permitting  on-site  inspections  of  military  units  and  sites.  It  con¬ 
tained  provisions  that  would  provide  experience  in  some  aspects  of 
implementing  an  on-site  inspection  regime.  The  Stockholm  Docu¬ 
ment  mandated  notification  procedures  for  the  United  States, 
Canada,  and  each  of  the  33  European  signatory  states  when  they 
scheduled  and  conducted  military  activities  involving  at  least 
13,000  troops  or  300  tanks.  Moreover,  to  confirm  that  the  activi¬ 
ties  were  nonthreatening,  each  state  had  the  right  to  observe  field 
military  activities  of  another  state  when  participating  forces  ex¬ 
ceeded  17,000  ground  troops  or  5,000  airborne  or  amphibious 
troops.  Across  Europe,  there  were  few  such  large-scale  events. 
When  an  exercise  occurred,  however,  a  state  would  issue  a  simple 
declaration  that  “compliance  was  in  doubt”  and  the  state  being 
inspected  had  to  accept  the  inspection  team.  There  was  no  right  of 
refusal  by  the  nation  to  be  inspected.  Each  state,  however,  was 
liable  for  only  three  inspections  per  year  of  its  field  exercises,  and 
no  nation  could  inspect  another  twice  in  the  same  year.  Thus,  the 
opportunities  for  inspections  were  infrequent.29 

By  any  measure,  the  number  of  people  required  to  implement 
the  inspection  rights  and  requirements  of  the  Stockholm  Docu¬ 
ment  of  1986  was  minimal.  In  fact,  the  number  was  so  small  that 
no  European  nation  saw  fit  to  establish  a  full-time  treaty  verifica¬ 
tion  center  to  carry  out  those  provisions.  The  Stockholm  Docu¬ 
ment  signatories  assigned  the  inspection  missions  to  a  section  of 
their  military  staffs  at  national  military  headquarters.  In  contrast, 
the  bilateral  INF  Treaty  between  the  United  States  and  the  USSR 
contained  on-site  inspection  rights  that  allowed  more  than  250 


Initial  Preparations:  United  States  and  the  NATO  Nations  57 


inspections  in  the  first  year  alone.  The  CFE  Treaty’s  inspection, 
escort,  reduction,  and  data  functions  were  so  substantial  that  all  of 
the  European  signatory  states  set  up  separate  verification  agencies 
or  specific  military  staff  offices.  Their  mission  was  to  assist  their 
military  forces  to  comply  with  the  treaty  and  to  monitor  other 
nations’  compliance. 

Among  the  NATO  nations,  Germany,  France,  and  Great 
Britain  elected  to  establish  separate  treaty  verification  agencies. 
Brigadier  General  Doctor  Heinz  Loquai,  Director  of  the  Zentrum 
fur  Verifikationsaufgaben  der  Bundeswehr  (ZVBW)  (Federal 
Armed  Forces  Verification  Center),  said  that  Germany’s  decision¬ 
making  process  began  in  1989,  with  the  new  center  being  estab¬ 
lished  in  October  1990.  “The  main  reason,”  he  explained,  “for  the 
establishment  of  the  center  was  Germany’s  foreseeable  workload 
in  the  area  of  the  CFE  Treaty.  Germany  had  more  CFE  sites  than 
did  the  Soviet  Union.”30  The  mission  of  the  new  German  verifica¬ 
tion  center  was  to  inspect,  escort,  and  monitor  all  activities  under 
the  CFE  Treaty.  It  also  had  responsibility  for  inspections  under  the 
Vienna  Document  1990,  which  substantially  broadened  the  scope 
of  inspection  activities  of  the  earlier  Stockholm  Document  agree¬ 
ment.  In  the  fall  of  1990,  the  ZVBW  had  65  officers  and  noncom¬ 
missioned  officers  (NCOs);  two  years  later  it  had  400. 31 

The  French  government  established  its  treaty  verification 
unit,  L’Unite  Fran^aise  de  Verification  (UFV),  in  September  1990 
at  the  Creil  Air  Station,  65  kilometers  north  of  Paris.  The  new 
French  unit  consisted  of  an  inspection  and  escort  staff  of  approxi¬ 
mately  100  officers  and  NCOs  drawn  from  all  the  military  ser¬ 
vices,  army,  navy,  and  air  force.  The  mission  of  this  new  unit,  led 
by  Brigadier  General  Jean-Paul  Huet,  was  to  implement  the  CFE

Treaty  and  the  Vienna  Document  1990.  According  to  Colonel 
Francois  Rozec,  the  UFV’s  second  commandant,  “The  Arms  Con¬ 
trol  Division  of  the  General  Staff  in  Paris  and  their  political 
equivalents,  it  is  their  concern  to  inform  our  [political]  authorities 
on  all  aspects  of  verification.  We  are  strictly  implemented.”32 

Great  Britain’s  experience  with  inspections  under  interna¬ 
tional  arms  control  agreements  prior  to  the  CFE  Treaty  was  simi¬ 
lar  to  Germany’s.  For  the  Stockholm  Document  of  1986,  the  Brit¬ 
ish  Ministry  of  Defense  assigned  the  mission  to  a  small  cadre  of 
military  officers  and  NCOs,  principally  people  with  experience  in 
the  British  Military  Liaison  Mission  in  Berlin.  This  small  staff 
carried  out  both  inspecting  and  escorting  missions.  In  August 
1990,  the  British  Ministry  of  Defense  established  the  Joint  Arms 
Control  Implementation  Group  (JACIG),  under  the  leadership  of 
Colonel  Roy  Giles,  at  RAF  Scampton  in  Lincolnshire.  Its  mission 
was  to  carry  out  the  United  Kingdom’s  commitments  and  entitle¬ 
ments  under  the  CLE  Treaty  and  the  Vienna  Document  1990. 
Initially,  the  new  group’s  manpower  strength  was  120  officers, 
NCOs,  and  civilians;  after  review  it  decreased  to  slightly  less  than 
100.  It  was  a  four-service  group,  with  Royal  Navy,  Marine,  Army, 
and  Air  Lorce  personnel.33

Among  the  other  NATO  nations,  Belgium,  the  Netherlands, 
and  Italy  chose  a  different  organizational  concept  when  they  set  up 
their  units  to  implement  the  CLE  Treaty.  They  used  a  cadre  model 
of  organization.  This  meant  that  the  national  military  command, 
usually  the  ministry  of  defense,  authorized  the  establishment  of  a 
small  unit  responsible  for  implementing  the  treaty,  usually  com¬ 
posed  of  20-30  military  officers.  Organized  at  the  level  just  below 
the  senior  military  headquarters,  this  unit’s  mission  was  to  recruit, 
train,  conduct  inspection  and  escort  missions,  transmit  treaty  data, 
and  monitor  reductions  mandated  by  the  treaty.  The  Belgian  verifi¬ 
cation  agency,  L’Unite  Beige  de  Verification  (UBV),  located  in 
Brussels,  was  typical.  Its  mission  was  to  lead  all  CLE  Treaty  in¬ 
spection  teams  and  to  participate  as  inspectors  on  the  team.  For 
the  escort  mission,  the  Belgian  agency  had  complete  responsibility 
for  the  logistics,  preparations,  and  presentation  of  the  sites  and 
units  to  be  inspected  by  the  Eastern  states’  CFE  Treaty  inspection 
teams.  They  also  had  responsibility  for  collecting  all  treaty-man¬ 
dated  data  on  the  Belgian  armed  forces  and  for  transmitting  that 
data  to  all  other  CFE  Treaty  signatory  nations.  During  CFE  in¬ 
spection  and  escort  operations,  personnel  from  the  military  forces 
augmented  the  staff  of  the  Belgian  verification  agency.  These  mili¬ 
tary  officers  and  NCOs  had  studied  the  treaty  in  special  courses 
led  by  the  agency’s  senior  officers.  In  most  cases,  especially  during 
escort  missions,  the  bulk  of  the  Belgian  team  consisted  of 
augmentees  from  its  military  forces.34

Major  General  Joseph  DiMaria, 
Director  of  Italy’s  verification 
agency,  Centro  Italiano  de  Verifica 
de  Armi  (CIV A). 


Italy  had  a  similar  organizational  structure.  The  Director, 
Major  General  Joseph  DiMaria,  of  the  Centro  Italiano  de  Verifica 
de  Armi  (CIVA),  explained  that  initially  a  cadre  of  approximately 
250  personnel  went  through  training  on  the  CFE  Treaty.35  Once 
they  had  completed  the  course,  they  returned  to  their  military 
units,  and  were  available  for  inspection  duty  as  needed.  According 
to  General  DiMaria,  “They  come  and  they  stay  a  couple  of  days  in 
the  agency;  they  have  a  refresher  course,  some  particular  training, 
or  some  special  training  for  the  target.”  The  Italian  agency,  he 
reported,  kept  one  team  on  duty  24  hours  a  day  “in  case  Italy  is 
notified  a  CFE  Treaty  inspection  team  is  arriving.” 

The  Netherlands  had  a  small  arms  control  treaty  coordina¬ 
tion  section  in  the  Ministry  of  Defense  at  The  Hague.36  The  Dutch 
military  forces  carried  out  the  bulk  of  Holland’s  CFE  Treaty  in¬ 
spection  and  escort  activities.  The  Dutch  Army  had  approximately 
80  officers  and  NCOs  trained  as  CFE  inspectors,  the  Dutch  Air 
Force  35,  and  the  Dutch  Navy  1.  The  actual  size  of  the  Nether¬ 
lands’  professional  staff  committed  to  implementing  the  CFE 
Treaty  was  much  smaller,  with  the  Dutch  Army  providing  10-12 
personnel,  the  Air  Force  4-5,  and  the  Navy  1.  According  to  Navy 
Commander  C.N.M.  Wierema,  Ministry  of  Defense  Coordinator, 
the  Netherlands  set  up  a  “decentralized  organization,”  with  the 
“bulk  of  the  work  done  in  the  arms  control  sections  of  the  forces.” 

In  general,  the  NATO  nations  established  their  CFE  Treaty 
verification  organizations  along  two  lines.  Nations  with  the  largest 
military  forces  and  the  most  sites  subject  to  inspection — the  United 
States,  Germany,  France,  and  Great  Britain — set  up  separate  verifi¬ 
cation  agencies.  Fed  by  senior  military  officers  and  staffed  with 


60 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


career  officers,  noncommissioned  officers,  and  civilians,  these 
agencies  ranged  in  size  from  100  to  400  personnel,  depending  on 
the  number  of  treaties  and  ancillary  functions  assigned  to  them. 
NATO  nations  with  smaller  military  forces  and  fewer  sites  in¬ 
cluded  in  the  treaty,  such  as  Belgium,  the  Netherlands,  and  Italy, 
adopted  a  cadre  model.  Led  by  a  senior  colonel  or  general  officer, 
these  verification  units  were  considerably  smaller  and  relied  on 
augmentees  drawn  from  the  military  forces  for  inspection  and 
escort  responsibilities.  In  general,  these  national  verification  agen¬ 
cies  and  staffs  had  six  basic  functions:  force  data  presentation, 
communication,  inspection,  escort,  treaty  training  for  national 
military  forces,  and  coordination  among  the  other  verification 
agencies. 

NATO’s  VCC 

During  CFE  Treaty  negotiations,  the  NATO  alliance  had  been 
deeply  involved  in  every  aspect  of  developing  the  treaty’s  text, 
protocols,  and  annexes.  Yet  in  the  final  document  neither  NATO 
nor  the  Warsaw  Treaty  Organization  (WTO)  were  identified  as 
alliances  in  the  formal  treaty  provisions.  Instead,  the  treaty  dealt 
with  two  “groups  of  states,”  and  each  state  was  responsible  for 
properly  implementing  the  treaty.  However,  NATO  constituted  an 
experienced,  bureaucratic  organization  for  its  group  of  states  to 
develop  group  objectives  and  negotiating  positions,  and  to  coordi¬ 
nate  treaty  planning  efforts.  During  treaty  negotiations,  NATO’s 


NATO’s  Verification  Coordinating  Committee 


Under  the  CFE  Treaty,  the  execution  of  all 
treaty  rights  and  obligations  is  reserved  to  the 
signatory  nations.  However,  during  negotiations 
the  NATO  states  had  worked  closely  together; 
and  during  implementation  they  continued  this 
cooperation,  agreeing  to  work  through  NATO’s 
Verification  Coordinating  Committee  (VCC). 

This  VCC  is  a  joint  political-military  coordi¬ 
nating  organization  with  two  representatives 
from  each  of  the  16  NATO  nations.  It  meets  at 
HQ  NATO,  usually  in  monthly  sessions.  A  small 
professional  staff,  the  Verification  and  Implemen¬ 
tation  Coordination  Section  (VICS)  facilitates  the 
work  of  the  larger  committee.  For  most  meetings, 
the  head  of  the  professional  staff  chairs  the  VCC 
sessions.  All  actions  are  taken  by  consensus. 


The  VCC  has  several  important  functions.  For 
the  NATO  Alliance  it  apportions  the  CFE  Treaty 
inspection  quotas  to  the  16  member  states.  It 
coordinates  the  CFE  Treaty  declared  site  inspec¬ 
tions  to  ensure  compliance  with  treaty  protocols 
and  to  ensure  maximum  coverage.  The  VCC 
establishes  and  maintains  a  common  treaty  data¬ 
base  for  the  NATO  nations.  It  also  assists  the 
NATO  states  in  collating  and  assessing  the  treaty 
data  concerning  treaty  compliance.  In  the  area  of 
training,  the  VCC  supports  formal  NATO  CFE 
Treaty  courses  to  ensure  a  “common  approach” 
to  implementation.  Finally,  the  VCC  has  respon¬ 
sibility  to  exchange,  among  the  signatory  states, 
“information”  on  verification  matters.

Initial  Preparations:  United  States  and  the  NATO  Nations 


High  Level  Task  Force  (HLTF)  at  Brussels  had  served  as  an  impor¬ 
tant  coordinating  body  for  screening  and  approving  proposals  for 
discussion  in  the  formal  sessions  in  Vienna.37  Collectively,  the 
NATO  nations  would  be  reducing  more  than  12,900  TLE  items 
under  the  CFE  Treaty,  and  they  would  have  a  total  of  2,447  OOVs 
subject  to  inspection  throughout  the  alliance.  Clearly,  after  treaty 
signature,  NATO  as  an  organization  would  continue  its  strong 
commitment  to  the  CFE  Treaty  throughout  implementation. 

In  fact,  six  months  before  the  treaty  was  signed  in  Paris, 
NATO  established  the  Verification  Coordinating  Committee 
(VCC)  in  Brussels  in  May  1990.  Its  purpose  was  to  coordinate  the 
implementation  of  disarmament  and  arms  control  agreements 
among  the  16-nation  alliance.  General  John  R.  Galvin,  USA, 
USCINCEUR,  was  instrumental  in  encouraging  Headquarters 
NATO  to  establish  this  important  committee.  General  Galvin 
insisted  that  NATO  had  a  central  role  in  treaty  implementation, 
specifically  in  coordination,  training,  and  scheduling.  NATO’s 
Assistant  Secretary  General  for  Political  Affairs,  Gebhardt  von 
Moltke,  became  the  VCC’s  permanent  chairman.  The  committee 
set  up  a  small  professional  staff  for  its  Verification  Coordination 
Implementation  Section.  Led  by  Leo  Verbruggen,  a  retired  navy 
captain  from  the  Netherlands,  this  professional  staff  became  an 
important  element  in  carrying  out  the  CFE  Treaty.38 

Just  what  did  the  VCC  do?  Much  of  the  work  in  the  first  18 
months  consisted  of  examining  the  CFE  Treaty’s  bloc-to-bloc 
quotas  for  declared  site  inspections  and  establishing  a  schedule  of 
inspections  among  NATO’s  16  states.  In  addition,  it  developed  an 
approach  to  scheduling  reduction  inspections  of  the  Eastern  states. 
Aided  by  initiatives  from  the  member  states,  in  1991  the  VCC 
developed  a  plan  for  “deconflicting”  the  schedule  of  national 
inspections.  “Deconfliction”  was  vital  because  the  treaty  limited 
each  state’s  inspection  obligations  in  several  ways.  The  treaty 
limited  a  nation’s  inspection  liability  during  any  treaty  period.  It 
also  limited  simultaneous  inspections  in  a  nation  or  specific  mili¬ 
tary  district  to  two,  as  well  as  allowing  no  more  than  one  inspec¬ 
tion  team  on-site  at  any  time. 

To  comply  with  these  restrictions  and  yet  permit  NATO 
nations  to  conduct  all  inspections  available  to  them,  the  VCC 
evaluated  a  deconfliction  schedule  concept  in  December  1990. 
Authored  by  Colonel  John  C.  Reppert,  USA,  OSIA,  this  concept 
called  for  a  matrix  system  that  had  the  six  Eastern  nations  and  the 
Soviet  Union's  military  districts  with  inspectable  sites  along  one 
axis.  The  other  axis  had  three-day  increments  for  conducting  the 
actual  inspections.  Working  with  the  number  of  inspections  al¬ 
lowed,  each  NATO  nation  under  this  system  would  “sign  up”  to 
conduct  an  inspection  during  a  particular  three-day  block  of  time 
against  a  particular  state.  Next,  the  VCC  staff  would  compare  the 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


national  requests  and  negotiate  any  conflicts  among  the  alliance’s 
states.  This  required  a  great  deal  of  negotiation  because  there  was 
significant  interest  by  most  NATO  states  to  inspect  Russia  and,  to 
a  lesser  degree,  Ukraine,  and  considerably  less  interest  in  inspect¬ 
ing  the  other  states.  After  protracted  discussions,  the  VCC  adopted 
this  matrix  system  for  deconflicting  the  schedule  of  national  in¬ 
spections.39  While  this  process  was  unfolding  in  Brussels,  OSIA’s 
European  Operations  Command  was  receiving  new  leadership  at 
Rhein-Main. 

New  Leadership 

In  1990,  before  the  CFE  Treaty  was  signed,  General  Lajoie, 
OSIA’s  Director,  selected  two  senior  colonels  to  lead  the  OSIA 
European  Operations  Command’s  rapidly  expanding  effort.  Air 
Force  Colonel  Frederick  E.  Grosick  became  Commander  and 
Marine  Corps  Colonel  Lawrence  G.  Kelley  was  the  new  Chief  of 
Operations.  Since  the  INF  Treaty  was  still  extremely  active,  with 
missile  elimination,  site  closeout,  and  short-notice  and  continuous 
portal  monitoring  inspections,  OSIA’s  European  Operations  Com¬ 
mand  retained  all  of  its  “gateway”  responsibilities.  At  Rhein- 
Main,  it  was  responsible  for  supporting  all  INF  Treaty  inspection 
teams  transiting  Europe  to  inspect  missile  sites  in  the  western 
Soviet  Union.  It  also  supported  Threshold  Test  Ban  Treaty  inspec¬ 
tors  and  equipment  specialists,  as  well  as  U.S.  and  USSR  START 
Treaty  inspection  teams  traveling  through  the  gateway  to  conduct

The  VCC  adopted  a  matrix  system  to  schedule  and  coordinate  inspection  missions.

exhibition  inspections.  But  its  principal  activity,  beginning  in  late 
summer  1990,  was  to  organize,  prepare,  train,  and  be  ready  to 
conduct  inspections  and  escorts  under  the  CFE  Treaty. 

Both  Colonel  Grosick  and  Colonel  Kelley  had  considerable 
experience  in  commanding,  planning,  and  developing  military 
units.40  Grosick  was  a  command  pilot  with  over  3,100  flying 
hours.  A  graduate  of  the  U.S.  Air  Force  Academy,  he  held  an  ad¬ 
vanced  degree  from  Indiana  University.  Fie  had  served  in  opera¬ 
tional  and  staff  jobs  in  the  Strategic  Air  Command,  Pacific  Air 
Forces,  U.S.  Air  Forces  in  Europe,  and  Headquarters  USAF.  Just 
prior  to  commanding  OSIA’s  European  Operations  Command, 

Colonel  Grosick  had  served  as  Deputy  Commander  for  Operations 
of  the  42d  Bombardment  Wing,  a  B-52  and  KC-135  wing  located 
at  Loring  AFB,  Maine.  Colonel  Kelley  was  a  Princeton  University 
graduate  who  had  studied  at  Leningrad  State  University,  the  U.S. 

Army  Russian  Institute,  and  Georgetown  University  (master  of 
arts).  In  Vietnam,  Kelley  was  a  Marine  attack  pilot,  flight  instruc-  Colonel  Frederick  E.  Grosick, 
tor,  infantry  company  commander,  and  battalion  air  liaison  officer.  Commander,  OSIA  European 
A  Russian  foreign  area  officer  (FAO),  who  spoke  German  as  well,  Operations  Command. 
he  served  as  a  presidential  translator  on  the  Washington-Moscow 
Hot  Line.  In  1983  he  went  to  the  U.S.  Military  Liaison  Mission 
(USMLM)  in  Potsdam,  German  Democratic  Republic,  as  the  naval 
representative  and  later  as  deputy  to  the  Chief  of  the  Mission, 

General  Lajoie.  Early  in  1988,  Lt.  Colonel  Kelley  came  to  OSIA  as 
an  INF  inspection  team  chief,  leading  15  inspection  missions  in  the 
Soviet  Union  and  Czechoslovakia.  Following  a  two-year  stint  as  a 
senior  instructor  at  the  NATO  School  at  Oberammergau,  Ger¬ 
many,  he  returned  to  OSIA  as  General  Lajoie’s  choice  to  be  OSIA 
European  Operation  Command’s  Chief  of  Operations. 

The  two  officers  brought  different  strengths  and  personalities 
to  the  operation.  At  Rhein-Main  Air  Base,  Colonel  Grosick  used 
his  Air  Force  experience  to  address  issues  of  personnel,  transporta¬ 
tion,  office  space,  communications,  housing,  and  facilities.  The 
command  would  expand  sixfold  in  less  than  two  years;  that 
growth  required  attention  to  all  manner  of  personnel  and  organi¬ 
zational  details.  At  the  same  time,  Colonel  Kelley  focused  on  de¬ 
fining  the  CFE  Treaty’s  operational  mission.  He  drew  upon  his 
experience  as  an  INF  Treaty  inspection  team  chief,  his  knowledge 
of  NATO  and  the  U.S.  Military  Liaison  Mission,  and  his  extensive 
study  of  Soviet  military  forces.  The  personalities  of  these  two 
colonels  were  quite  different.  Grosick  was  a  tall,  robust,  gregari¬ 
ous  aviator  experienced  in  handling  the  details  of  an  active  opera¬ 
tional  field  command.  Kelley  was  a  lean,  ascetic,  ramrod  Marine 
who  had  an  exceptionally  clear  concept  of  the  CFE  Treaty,  the 
NATO  alliance,  and  the  Soviet  Union.  In  the  early  months,  plan¬ 
ning  dominated.  At  Rhein-Main,  there  was  more  work  than  time, 
people,  or  resources;  the  division  of  leadership  responsibilities 
worked  well.

Colonel  Lawrence  G.  Kelley,  USMC 

Colonel  Lawrence  G.  Kelley,  U.S.  Marine  Corps,  was  the  Chief  of 
Operations,  OSIA  European  Operations  Command,  from  October 
1990  through  January  1995.  He  recruited,  organized,  planned,  trained, 
and  led  OSIA’s  CFE  Treaty  on-site  inspection  operations. 


When  you  came  to  the  command,  did  you  have  an 
operational  concept ? 

“Yes.  I  planned  to  replicate  what  we  did  in  the 
INF  Treaty.  I  planned  to  use  integral  teams,  as  we 
had  during  the  baseline  period  for  INF.  The  num¬ 
bers  changed  somewhat,  but  I  thought  that  the 
composition  of  the  team  would  be  similar.  Over  the 
first  several  months  after  I  arrived  at  Frankfurt,  the 
manning  document  was  the  center  of  our  attention. 

“For  the  team  chiefs,  I  looked  for  the  kind  of 
personnel  that  we  had  at  the  beginning  of  the  INF 
period  and  which  we  had  and  routinely  looked  for 
in  U.S.  Military  Liaison  Mission  (USMLM). 

“The  team  chiefs  would  be,  to  use  an  analogy, 
the  independent  patrol  leaders,  with  whom  you’d 
have  precious  little  contact  once  they  deployed,  and 
on  whom  you  had  to  rely  implicitly.  You  had  to 
train  them  up  as  far  as  you  could,  give  them  ad¬ 
equate  guidance,  fill  them  full  of  treaty  specifics, 
provide  them  the  kind  of  surrogate  wisdom  that 
they  might  not  otherwise  have  at  the  outset,  give 
them  ‘what  if’  situations  to  death,  force  them  to  do 
all  of  the  homework  that  this  required,  and  then 
count  on  them  to  apply  the  tools  of  their  trade  to 
get  the  job  done.” 

How  did  the  command  deal  with  the  shifting  plan¬ 
ning  assumptions ? 

“The  primary  reason  why  the  treaty  data 
changed  was  not  because  of  German  unification, 
but  [because  of]  internal  decisions  made  within  the 
Soviet  Union.  Initially,  as  a  round  figure,  the  Soviets 
had  said  that  their  data  would  contain  1,500  objects 
of  verification.  That  had  been  the  estimate  of  U.S. 
authorities,  and  it  was  confirmed  as  a  working 
figure  by  the  Soviets  during  treaty  negotiations, 
fdowever,  when  the  data  were  actually  submitted, 
on  17  November  1990,  there  were  only  about  900 
Soviet  objects  of  verification. 

“The  result  was  that,  although  our  manning 
document  had  been  crafted  for  16  teams,  we  were 
directed  by  OSIA’s  Chief  of  Staff  to  reduce  man¬ 


power.  Ultimately 
we  acquiesced, 
reducing  it  to  eight 
teams,  with  some 
misgivings  on  my 
part  because  it  took 
away  any  opera¬ 
tional  reserve  that 

we  had  in  the  event  that  anything  went  wrong.  But 
we  did  so,  nonetheless.” 

What  was  your  concept  for  inspector  and  team 
training ? 

“I  expected  them  to  learn  the  treaty  as  part  of  a 
treaty  course,  initially.  But  then  would  come  a  great 
deal  of  self-study  and  study  in  groups,  such  as  with 
the  team  or  in  the  Inspectors  and  Escorts  branch. 

“I  made  a  conscious  decision  very  early  on  to 
foster  the  team  as  the  unit  with  which  I  wanted  the 
inspectors  to  identify.  Prior  to  their  identification 
within  the  branch  or  even  the  unit  as  a  whole,  I 
wanted  them  to  think  of  themselves  first  and  fore¬ 
most  as  a  member  of  Team  One,  or  Two,  or  Six,  or 
Team  Jones,  or  Team  Kelley,  or  whatever  it  would 
be.  That  is  where  I  wanted  the  allegiance  to  be 
initially.  That  is  where  I  wanted  the  identification. 
That’s  where  I  wanted  the  standards  to  be  set. 
That’s  where  I  anticipated  that  the  key  to  training 
and  success  ultimately  would  come,  as  a  matter  of 
cohesiveness.  Because  of  their  internal  training, 
because  of  knowing  each  other,  backing  each  other 
up,  bonding,  and  so  forth,  they  would  develop  into 
a  cohesive  unit:  a  team.  I  think  that  was  a  very 
important  operational  concept  that  we  started 
within  the  INF  Treaty,  and  were  successful  in  con¬ 
tinuing  throughout  the  INF  Baseline  Period,  al¬ 
though  OSIA  later  abandoned  it  for  reasons  of 
convenience. 

“I  have  always  been  a  very  firm  believer  in  unit 
cohesiveness.  So  I  consciously  set  the  teams  up  that 
way,  and  insisted  that  they  work  as  units,  think  as 
units,  act  as  units.”

Initial  Preparations:  United  States  and  the  NATO  Nations 


The  first  months,  Kelley  said,  were  largely  spent  working  and 
reworking  the  manning  document.  This  effort  involved  extensive 
coordination  with  senior  treaty  planners  at  Headquarters  OSIA: 
Colonel  John  C.  Reppert,  USA;  Lt.  Colonel  Paul  H.  Nelson,  USA; 
and  Lt.  Colonel  Thomas  S.  Brock,  USA.  By  December  1990  the 
manning  document  had  gone  through  more  than  25  versions. 
Following  the  Soviet  Union’s  February  1991  decision  to  reclassify 
its  CFE  Treaty  TLE,  the  manning  document  changed  again  in 
March  1991.  Throughout  the  process,  the  focus  of  the  numerous 
planning  efforts  was  on  the  inspection  team:  just  what  was  the 
right  number  of  teams,  the  type  of  leadership,  the  degree  of  lan¬ 
guage  competency,  and  the  mixture  of  inspection  skills.  Another 
consideration  was  the  availability  of  potential  team  members — 
when  could  they  be  identified  and  report  to  Europe  for  individual 
treaty  training,  team  training,  and  full-scale  mock  inspections?41 


The  team  leaders  were 
officers  “ with  whom  you 
would  have  precious  little 
contact. ..on  whom  you  had 
to  rely  implicitly.  ” 

— Col.  Lawrence  G.  Kelley,  USMC 
Chief  of  Operations,  OSIA  European 
Operations  Command 


The  American  CFE  Treaty  Inspection  Teams 

A  Treaty-specified  limit  of  nine  inspectors  per  team  drove  the 
design  of  all  inspection  teams.  The  U.S.  teams  consisted  of  inspec¬ 
tors  who  were  professional  military  officers  and  noncommissioned 
officers;  other  U.S.  augmentee  inspectors  were  civilian  specialists. 
The  team  chiefs  would  be,  in  Colonel  Kelley’s  terms,  “independent 
patrol  leaders.”42  Based  on  OSIA’s  experience  with  the  INF  Treaty 
inspections,  General  Lajoie  and  Colonel  Kelley  decided  that  the 
team  chiefs  would  be  experienced  field  grade  officers.  During  an 
inspection,  these  officers  and  their  teams  would  be  traveling  under 
escort  to  remote  places  in  the  Soviet  Union  and  Eastern  Europe, 
and  at  times  they  would  have  to  lead  inspections  in  extremely 
severe  weather  conditions  on  the  Eurasian  continent.  As  Kelley 
saw  it,  the  team  leaders  were  officers  “with  whom  you  would  have 
precious  little  contact  once  they  deployed,  and  on  whom  you  had 
to  rely  implicitly.”43  From  the  beginning,  he  wanted  a  specific  type 
of  officer:  a  U.S.  Army  or  Marine  Russian  foreign  area  officer 
(FAO)  or  Air  Force  officers  with  similar  skills,  although  the  Air 
Force  did  not  have  a  comparable  program.  FAOs  were  career 
military  officers  who  had  served  in  one  of  the  combat  branches 
and  then  had  specialized  in  Russian  language  and  Soviet  military 
force  structure.  Highly  trained  and  educated,  Russian  FAOs  were 
in  demand  as  attaches,  arms  control  specialists,  and  plans/analysis 
staff  officers.  In  fact,  the  demand  for  them  was  so  great  that  they 
were  not  available  for  assignment  to  fill  all  the  CFE  team  chief 
positions. 

Consequently,  Headquarters  OSIA  and  its  European  Opera¬ 
tions  Command  accepted  a  different  composition  of  team  chiefs: 
some  Russian  FAOs,  some  West  European  FAOs,  and  some  line 
officers — artillery  officers,  aircraft  commanders,  or  armor  officers. 
The  U.S.  Army’s  European  FAOs  had  similar  education,  training,

Military  Experience 


U.S.  inspectors  were  professionals 
in  their  fields. 


and  experiences  to  the  Russian  FAOs,  except  that  they  had  spent 
much  of  their  career  working  with  NATO  armies,  air  forces,  and 
staffs.  The  line  officers  had  served  nearly  all  of  their  Army  or  Air 
Force  careers  working  with  combat  units  in  armor,  infantry,  artil¬ 
lery,  or  tactical  aircraft.  They  knew  U.S.  military  force  structure, 
weapons,  units,  and  personnel,  specifically  how  the  soldiers,  ma¬ 
rines,  and  airmen  combined  to  make  an  operational  unit.  Equally 
important,  they  were  experienced  in  serving  in  and  evaluating 
operational  military  units.  So  it  was  from  these  three  groups  that 
the  CFE  team  chiefs  came.  As  for  the  deputies,  Colonel  Kelley  and 
Colonel  Grosick  decided  that  the  second  officers  would  be  field 
grade  officers,  ideally  at  the  rank  of  major.  Their  backgrounds 
would  complement  those  of  the  team  chiefs,  so  that  if  one  officer 
could  not  speak  Russian,  the  other  would. 

How  did  these  plans  work  out?  Six  of  the  eight  team  chiefs 
were  lieutenant  colonels.  The  eight  deputy  team  chiefs,  except  for 
one  captain  and  one  warrant  officer,  were  majors  or  major  select¬ 
ees.  Noncommissioned  officers  filled  the  two  team  positions  for 
treaty  linguists.  Trained  as  Russian  linguists,  these  NCOs  had 
served  in  the  U.S.  military  with  its  high  standards  for  noncommis¬ 
sioned  officer  leadership  and  training.  They  were  professional 
soldiers.  Two  other  inspection  team  members  were  also  NCOs; 
they  were  weapons  specialists  who  had  direct  experience  with 
conventional  armed  forces  in  the  European  theater.  Rounding  out 
the  nine-person  inspection  team  were  three  specialists  who  were 
knowledgeable  in  Soviet  and  Central  European  military  forces.44 

This  purposeful  mix  of  military  skills  and  experiences  among 
team  members  gave  Colonel  Kelley  flexibility  in  assigning  inspec¬ 
tion  teams  to  missions.  Any  American  team  could  inspect  either  a 
Polish  armor  regiment  or  a  Soviet  tactical  air  unit  because  some¬ 
one  on  the  team  had  firsthand  experience  with  armor  and  some¬ 
one  else  had  worked  on  or  flown  aircraft.  The  CFE  Treaty’s  Proto¬ 
col  on  Inspections  allowed  each  inspection  team  to  break  into 
three  subteams,  and  it  was  American  policy  to  routinely  use  three 
subteams.  The  protocol,  however,  required  each  subteam  to  pos¬ 
sess  linguistic  capability  in  the  inspected  country’s  language.  Since 
every  U.S.  team  had  two  linguists,  either  the  team  chief  or  deputy 
had  to  speak  Russian  to  allow  the  team  to  break  down  into  three 
subteams  for  greater  operational  coverage  at  an  inspection  site. 

At  treaty  signature  in  November  1990,  the  best  estimate  for 
entry  into  force  was  April  1,  1991.  To  be  ready  to  inspect  and 
escort  on  that  date,  OSIA's  European  Operations  had  to  have  the 
team  chiefs,  deputies,  linguists,  and  weapons  specialists  in  place  in 
Europe  by  January  1,  1991.  This  did  not  happen.  Because  of  the 
Gulf  War,  the  limited  availability  of  FAOs,  and  the  drawdown  of 
American  forces,  the  U.S.  military  personnel  system  could  not 
provide  qualified  officers  and  NCOs  rapidly  for  reassignment  to 


67 


Initial  Preparations:  United  States  and  the  NATO  Nations 


Europe.  Frustrated  because  the  unit  had  to  be  ready  regardless  of 
the  U.S.  military’s  systemic  problems,  Colonel  Kelley  recalled  that 
they  “were  totally  unable  to  acquire  personnel  until,  at  the  earliest, 
January  31,  1991,”  and  even  then  the  fill  was  only  partial.  This 
delay  was  serious:  individual  treaty  training  would  be  postponed, 
team  training  could  not  begin,  and  mock  inspections  evaluating 
the  readiness  of  U.S.  CFE  sites  in  Western  Europe  could  not  be 
undertaken.  Nominations  came  late,  arrivals  still  later.  Not  until 
the  summer  of  1991  did  six  of  the  eight  team  chiefs  arrive  at 
Rhein-Main.  Two  of  the  deputy  team  leaders  did  not  reach  Ger¬ 
many  until  December  1991,  12  months  behind  initial  expecta¬ 
tions.45 


An  Unforeseen  Delay 

There  was  an  unforeseen  development.  No  nation  had  rati¬ 
fied  the  CFE  Treaty  in  time  for  the  projected  April  1991  entry  into 
force  date.  In  fact,  the  national  ratification  process  was  not  com¬ 
pleted  at  all  in  1991;  it  was  not  until  July  1992  that  the  treaty 
entered  into  force  provisionally.  This  delay  allowed  time  for  five 
parallel  developments. 

First,  it  allowed  time  for  the  national  ratification  processes  to 
conclude  in  1991-92  in  the  congresses,  parliaments,  and  govern¬ 
ments  of  all  the  CFE  Treaty  signatory  states.  Next,  it  allowed  time 
for  intense  diplomatic  negotiations  by  the  CFE  Treaty  states  with 
the  Soviet  Union  over  two  significant  issues:  the  relocation 
and  transfer  of  its  TLE  beyond  the  Ural  Mountains,  and  the 
redesignation  of  forces  as  naval  infantry.  Because  of  those  diplo¬ 
matic  discussions,  the  NATO  nations  delayed  treaty  ratification 
until  the  summer  and  fall  of  1991.  Third,  it  gave  the  Western  and 
Eastern  European  national  verification  agencies,  many  of  which 


U.S.  inspectors  received  experience 
during  training  in  Czechoslovakia.

were  newly  established,  time  to  develop  leadership  cadres,  inspec¬ 
tion  teams,  escort  teams,  communications  systems  and  procedures, 
and  operational  plans  for  conducting  on-site  inspections  and  es¬ 
corts.  Fourth,  there  was  time  for  the  new  verification  agencies  to 
conduct  extensive  practice,  or  mock,  inspections  with  their  own 
national  military  forces,  with  the  military  forces  in  their  respective 
alliances,  and  in  a  few  instances,  with  the  military  forces  of  na¬ 
tions  in  the  opposing  alliance.  Finally,  it  allowed  time  for  the 
consequences  of  the  Soviet  Union’s  demise  to  unfold.  That  epochal 
development  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  15  successor  nations 
and  set  in  motion  a  series  of  political,  military,  diplomatic,  and 
economic  developments.  Six  months  after  the  collapse  of  the  So¬ 
viet  Union,  the  successor  states  agreed  in  May  1992  at  Tashkent, 
Uzbekistan,  to  partition  the  former  USSR’s  military  forces  and 
accept  all  of  its  CFE  Treaty  obligations. 

These  five  developments  profoundly  influenced  the  CFE 
Treaty.  Discussed  in  the  next  chapter,  they  demonstrated  how  the 
changing  international  order  profoundly  altered  the  mission  of 
implementing  a  signed  arms  control  treaty.  The  CFE  Treaty  was 
essentially  a  European  arms  reduction  and  conflict  prevention 
treaty.  When  Europe  changed  profoundly  in  1991-92,  so  too  did 
the  context  for  planning  the  treaty’s  implementation.  There  is  a 
simple  historical  truth,  known  to  every  experienced  verification 
agency  director:  “Every  treaty  has  its  own  particular  history.”  This 
was  never  more  apparent  than  in  1991-92  with  the  ratification 
process  and  operational  preparations  for  the  Conventional  Armed 
Forces  in  Europe  Treaty.

East  German  guard  on  patrol  hours  before  the  fall  of  the  Berlin  Wall  on  November  9,  1989. 

As  Europe  entered  the  1990s,  it  was  in  turmoil.  From  1989 
to  1992 — coinciding  with  the  years  of  the  CFE  Treaty’s 
negotiation,  ratification,  and  entry  into  force — nations  on 
the  European  continent  were  experiencing  their  greatest  changes 
since  the  end  of  World  War  II.  There  was  the  unification  of  Ger¬ 
many;  the  “velvet”  political  revolutions  casting  out  Communist 
systems  in  Poland,  Hungary,  and  Czechoslovakia;  the  bloody 
revolution  in  Romania;  the  continuous  integration  of  the  Euro¬ 
pean  Union;  the  recurrent  economic  and  political  crises  in  the 
Soviet  Union  presaging  its  collapse;  the  national  independence 
movements  in  the  former  Soviet  republics;  and,  running  through¬ 
out,  the  large-scale  military  withdrawals  from  Central  and  West¬ 
ern  Europe  by  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  United  States.  Politically, 


74 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


diplomatically,  and  militarily,  the  European  continent  was  in  the 
midst  of  revolutionary  changes.  It  was  in  this  context  that  ratifica¬ 
tion  and  implementation  of  the  CFE  Treaty  proceeded. 


From  Treaty  Signature  to  Ratification 


U.S.  ratification — December  26, 
1991. 


In  constitutional  governments,  treaties  require  two  acts  for 
legitimacy:  executive  signature  and  legislative  ratification.  For  the 
United  States,  President  Bush  signed  the  CFE  Treaty  in  Paris  on 
November  19,  1990.  That  same  day,  the  leaders  of  21  other 
NATO  and  Warsaw  Pact  nations  signed  the  treaty.  Ratification, 
however,  took  nearly  two  years.  On  October  30,  1992,  just  20 
days  short  of  two  full  years,  the  final  two  states,  Belarus  and 
Kazakstan,  ratified  the  treaty  and  deposited  their  instruments  of 
ratification  at  The  Hague  in  the  Netherlands.  Why  did  it  take  so 
long? 

One  CFE  Treaty  signatory  state,  the  Soviet  Union,  was  in 
such  turmoil  in  1991  and  1992  that  its  very  existence  was  in  ques¬ 
tion.1  When  the  USSR  collapsed  in  late  December  1991,  its  succes¬ 
sor  states  had  to  form  new  governments,  and  those  governments 
had  to  work  out  military  and  security  relationships  with  Russia, 
the  largest  and  most  powerful  of  the  former  republics. 

So  great  were  the  repercussions  from  the  Soviet  Union’s  inter¬ 
nal  difficulties  that  the  CFE  Treaty  signatory  states  had  to  convene 
four  separate  extraordinary  meetings  to  approve,  authorize,  and 
incorporate  new  statements,  understandings,  declarations,  and 
agreements  into  the  treaty  regarding  entitlements  and  obligations. 
In  June  1991,  the  signatory  states  met  at  The  Hague;  in  October 
1991  they  convened  in  Vienna;  in  June  1992  they  met  in  Oslo; 
and,  finally,  in  July  1992,  they  assembled  just  before  the  Confer¬ 
ence  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE)  summit  in 
Helsinki.  At  each  of  these  meetings,  the  diplomats  took  up  specific 
treaty  issues  for  the  group  to  resolve  before  the  individual  states 
would  proceed  with  ratification  and  implementation.  Every  issue 
was  a  consequence  of  the  Soviet  Union’s  collapse  as  an  empire. 
Throughout  these  extraordinary  meetings  across  Europe,  the  com¬ 
mitment  of  the  European  and  North  Atlantic  states  to  the  CFE 
Treaty  as  the  “cornerstone  of  European  security”  proved  to  be 
remarkably  strong  and  durable. 


The  First  Crisis:  Surprises  at  the 
Data  Exchange 

The  first,  and  most  serious,  issue  arose  at  the  time  of  the 
CSCE/CFE  Treaty  summit  in  November  1990.  On  November  18, 
one  day  before  treaty  signing,  representatives  from  each  of  the 


75 


Ratification  Delayed,  Europe  in  Turmoil,  Soviet  Union  in  Revolution 


signatory  states  placed  stacks  of  treaty-mandated  data  books  on 
long  rows  of  tables  in  the  Hofburg  Palace  in  Vienna.  The  books 
listed  detailed  information  on  force  structure,  force  size,  military 
units  and  organizations,  and  military  weapons  in  the  five  treaty 
categories  of  armaments:  tanks,  artillery,  armored  personnel  carri¬ 
ers,  helicopters,  and  combat  aircraft.  Shortly  thereafter,  state  del¬ 
egates  moved  from  table  to  table  scooping  up  copies  of  these  in¬ 
valuable  military  force  data.  U.S.  CFE  Treaty  Negotiator  Lynn  M. 
Hansen,  who  was  in  the  Hofburg  Palace  that  morning,  character¬ 
ized  the  exchange  as  having  the  “aura  of  a  bazaar.”  He  remem¬ 
bered  military  officers  and  specialists  excited  and  buzzing  at  the 
opportunity  to  compare  treaty  declarations  against  current  esti¬ 
mates.2  Within  days,  however,  the  atmosphere  changed  for  the 
worse  as  serious  questions  arose  about  the  Soviet  Union’s  force 
data  (see  table  3-1). 3 


It  appeared  to  many  of  the  state  delegates  in  Vienna  that  the 
Soviet  Union  had  underrepresented  its  treaty  holdings  by  a  signifi¬ 
cant  degree.  In  July  1988,  when  all  the  states  had  presented  their 
force  data  to  the  negotiating  teams,  the  Soviet  Union  had  given  out 
one  set  of  data.  Now  in  November  1990,  at  treaty  signature,  it 
had  presented  a  much  different  set  of  data.  When  compared,  there 
were  major  discrepancies.  U.S.  officials  reported  to  President  Bush 
that  the  Soviet  discrepancy  was  between  20,000  and  40,000  items: 
6,000  to  11,000  tanks,  12,000  armored  fighting  vehicles,  12,000 
artillery  pieces,  and  3,000  combat  aircraft.4  This  was  a  serious 
discrepancy,  one  that  clearly  threatened  ratification.  Was  there  a 
Soviet  explanation? 

In  Vienna,  Soviet  diplomats  explained  that  during  the  two 
years  of  treaty  negotiations,  1989-90,  the  Soviet  High  Command 
had  conducted  a  large-scale  operation  that  withdrew  thousands  of 
military  personnel,  weapons,  and  units  from  Central  and  Eastern 
Europe.  It  was  this  military  equipment,  they  asserted,  that  ac¬ 
counted  for  the  difference.5  They  explained  that  in  one  category 
alone,  tanks,  the  Soviet  Army  had  destroyed,  exported,  or  con¬ 
verted  more  than  4,000  items  since  1989.  The  Soviet  military  had 
sent  another  8,000  tanks  to  motor  rifle  and  other  divisions  sta¬ 
tioned  in  Asia,  or  to  military  storage  depots  located  beyond  the 
Ural  Mountains.  In  addition,  they  pointed  out  that  the  Soviet 
military  had  sent  thousands  of  items  from  other  treaty-limited 
equipment  (TLE)  categories — artillery,  armored  combat  vehicles 
(ACVs),  and  helicopters — to  military  depots  and  active  units  sta¬ 
tioned  beyond  the  Urals.6  The  Ural  Mountains  were  the  CFE 
Treaty’s  easternmost  boundary;  military  equipment  located  east 
of  the  Urals  was  not  subject  to  any  of  the  treaty’s  requirements. 
There  would  be  no  requirement  for  its  inclusion  in  the  initial  data, 
for  on-site  inspection  teams  to  count  it,  or  for  it  to  be  reduced 
within  a  set  period  of  time.  Finally,  the  Soviet  diplomats  explained 
that  since  much  of  this  equipment  had  been  transferred  from  spe-

cialized  combat  support  units,  those  units  no  longer  held  any 
TLE.  Those  units,  by  the  treaty’s  inspection  protocols,  would  not 
be  objects  of  verification  (OOVs).  As  a  result,  the  Soviet  Union’s 
OOVs  dropped  from  approximately  1,500  to  fewer  than  1,000. 

Further,  the  Soviet  diplomats  asserted  that  this  information 
should  not  have  come  as  a  surprise.  In  early  October,  Soviet  Gen¬ 
eral  Mikhail  A.  Moiseyev,  Chief  of  the  Soviet  General  Staff,  had 
announced  the  specific  details  of  many  of  these  force  movements 
at  a  Pentagon  press  conference  in  Washington,  D.C.8  Just  four 
weeks  before  the  Vienna  meeting,  Soviet  Foreign  Minister  Eduard 
Shevardnadze  had  sent  a  detailed  letter  on  October  13,  1990,  to 
U.S.  Secretary  of  State  James  Baker  listing  the  number  and  cat¬ 
egory  of  equipment  removed  from  Central  Europe  to  the  east.9  But 
some  Soviet  officials  had  made  statements  that  indicated  a  far 
different  situation.  In  early  October,  Soviet  Ambassador  Oleg 
Grinevsky  spoke  informally  with  the  other  CFE  Treaty  diplomats 
in  Vienna,  stating  that  the  USSR  would  have  1,600  OOVs  at 
treaty  signature,  and  approximately  1,500  OOVs  at  the  end  of  the 
40-month  reduction  phase.10  Therefore,  when  the  Soviet  Union 
revealed  in  Vienna,  just  one  day  before  the  official  signing  of  the 
treaty  in  Paris,  the  scope  of  its  unilateral  military  equipment  relo¬ 
cation  and  the  decrease  in  its  inspectable  sites,  it  surprised  and 
disturbed  many  diplomats  from  the  other  CFE  nations.  At  the  very 
least,  it  raised  serious  questions  of  credibility. 

Within  a  few  weeks,  diplomats  linked  these  questions  to 
other  unilateral  treaty-related  actions  by  the  Soviet  Union.  The 
Soviet  High  Command,  according  to  the  USSR’s  data  books,  had 
resubordinated  three  motor  rifle  divisions  to  naval  infantry  forces. 
In  terms  of  CFE  Treaty  equipment,  this  meant  they  had  transferred 
to  the  naval  forces  120  tanks,  753  armored  personnel  vehicles,  and 
234  artillery  pieces.  The  Soviet  High  Command  also  had  estab¬ 
lished  a  new  kind  of  naval  unit,  the  coastal  defense  forces,  and 
assigned  to  it  813  tanks,  972  ACVs,  and  846  artillery  pieces.  In 
addition,  the  Strategic  Rocket  Forces  received  1,791  ACVs.11 
During  treaty  negotiations,  delegates  considered  all  this  equipment 
to  be  a  part  of  the  USSR’s  CFE  Treaty  TLE  ceilings,  subject  to 
reduction  quotas  and  inspection  protocols.  In  Vienna,  Soviet  dip¬ 
lomats  argued  that  since  the  Soviet  High  Command  had  reassigned 
this  equipment  to  naval  units,  which  they  asserted  were  not  in¬ 
cluded  in  the  treaty,  the  equipment  would  not  be  subject  to  treaty 
inspections  or  ceilings.  Further,  they  asserted  that  the  Strategic 
Rocket  Forces’  1,791  ACVs  should  be  classified  as  internal  secu¬ 
rity  equipment,  again  outside  the  treaty’s  quantitative  provisions. 
Finally,  the  Soviet  data  omitted  18  PT-76  armored  combat  ve¬ 
hicles,  which  had  belonged  to  the  civil  defense  forces,  from  the 
TLE  category  of  heavy  armament  combat  vehicles.  Neither  in  their 
data  submission  nor  in  subsequent  discussions  did  the  Soviets  give 
any  explanation  for  this  omission.12 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


Despite  these  discrepancies,  the  treaty  was  signed  on  Novem¬ 
ber  19,  1990.  Nonetheless,  four  states — the  United  States,  Ger¬ 
many,  Canada,  and  Great  Britain — raised  specific  questions  about 
the  Soviet  data.  The  forum  they  used  was  the  newly  established 
CFE  Treaty  Joint  Consultative  Group  (JCG).13  One  of  this  group’s 
responsibilities  was  to  seek  resolutions  of  ambiguities  in  data  or 
differences  of  interpretation  resulting  from  treaty  implementation. 
Clearly,  the  dispute  with  the  Soviet  Union,  a  major  signatory  party, 
over  its  initial  data  submission  fell  within  the  scope  of  the  JCG. 
Article  V  of  the  treaty,  and  a  separate  protocol,  authorized  and  set 
forth  the  responsibilities  and  procedural  rules  governing  this  im¬ 
portant  joint  treaty  group.  Consisting  of  representatives  from 
every  signatory  state,  the  JCG  was  to  meet  in  Vienna  twice  a  year, 
with  each  session  lasting  four  weeks.  In  fact,  the  initial  issues  were 
so  contentious  that  the  JCG  met  in  nearly  continuous  monthly 
sessions  beginning  in  late  November  1990. 


Over  my  dead  body!” 

— Ambassador  R.  James  Woolsey, 
U.S.  CFE  Treaty  Negotiator 


The  state  parties  had  90  days — until  February  15,  1991 — to 
correct  any  discrepancies  in  their  initial  data  and  to  respond  to 
ambiguities.  The  United  States,  Great  Britain,  Germany,  and 
Canada  urged  the  Soviet  Union  to  reconsider  its  initial  submission. 
During  this  90-day  period,  diplomats  from  the  United  States  and 
several  other  NATO  nations  sought  to  use  bilateral  diplomacy 
to  resolve  the  issue.  Early  in  December,  Ambassador  R.  James 
Woolsey,  U.S.  CFE  Treaty  Negotiator,  Brigadier  General  Daniel  W. 
Christman,  USA,  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (JCS)  representative,  and  a 
small  team  flew  to  Moscow  to  meet  with  Defense  Minister  Mar¬ 
shal  Dmitriy  Yazov,  General  Moiseyev,  and  other  members  of  the 
Soviet  Supreme  High  Command.14  Foreign  Minister  Shevardnadze 
was  not  present.  Defense  Minister  Yazov  refused  categorically  to 
consider  any  changes  to  the  Soviet  position  on  the  former  TLE 
equipment  assigned  to  naval  and  civil  defense  units.  That  equip¬ 
ment,  he  asserted,  might  become  part  of  a  possible  future  treaty  on 
conventional  naval  forces,  but  the  Soviet  military  did  not  have  to 
count  it  with  the  Soviet  Union’s  TLE  for  the  CFE  Treaty.  Ambassa¬ 
dor  Woolsey  rejected  Yazov’s  assertion  out  of  hand.  He  regarded 
the  Soviet  defense  minister’s  position  as  directly  contravening  the 
negotiated  and  signed  treaty.  An  angry  confrontation  ensued. 
Woolsey  told  Yazov  that  the  United  States  would  accept  the  Soviet 
position  “over  my  dead  body!”15 

This  exchange  hardened  the  impasse.  At  subsequent  U.S.- 
USSR  diplomatic  meetings  in  Houston,  Texas,  and  Brussels, 
Belgium,  in  December  1990  and  January  1991,  Soviet  military 
leaders  remained  obdurate.  Then,  on  February  14,  1991,  the  So¬ 
viet  Union  presented  its  updated  treaty  data  to  the  JCG  in  Vienna. 
It  retained  every  essential  element  under  dispute — the  exempted 
TLE  reassigned  to  the  coastal  defense  forces,  naval  infantry  forces, 
Strategic  Rocket  Forces,  and  civil  defense  units.  Given  this  fact,

U.S.  Secretary  of  State  James  Baker  declared  on  the  same  day  that 
President  Bush  would  not  submit  the  CFE  Treaty  to  the  U.S.  Sen¬ 
ate  for  ratification.16 

It  is  interesting  that  in  the  midst  of  this  frosty  atmosphere,  the 
diplomats  resolved  one  issue:  the  20,000-40,000  discrepancy  in 
the  Soviets’  data.  Analysis  of  two  key  documents  supported  the 
Soviet  position.  First,  Soviet  Minister  Shevardnadze’s  letter  to 
Secretary  of  State  Baker,  dated  October  13,  1990,  had  contained 
specific  figures  on  the  Soviet  forces  and  equipment  in  the  treaty’s 
zones  as  well  as  details  on  the  TLE  transfers  from  1988  to  1990. 
Excerpted,  the  data  revealed  the  following  information:

Secretary  Baker  and  General  Cohn  Powell,  Chairman  of  the 
Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff,  had  received  these  Soviet  figures  in  late  Octo¬ 
ber.  Then,  three  weeks  later,  the  Soviets  had  presented  these  same 
figures  in  Vienna  at  the  initial  data  exchange.  Consequently,  con¬ 
tinued  U.S.  objections  in  the  winter  of  1990-91  stood  on  thin  ice. 
The  ice  got  even  thinner  in  January  1991  when  U.S.  intelligence 
estimates  confirmed  that  the  Soviet  Union’s  data  discrepancy  was 
not  in  the  20,000-40,000  range,  but  probably  entailed  2,000- 
3,000  items.17  With  this  new  estimate,  the  issue  melted  away, 
losing  its  power  to  influence  treaty  ratification. 

What  did  not  disappear,  however,  was  the  Soviet  High 
Command’s  insistence  on  the  legitimacy  of  resubordinating  the 
three  motorized  rifle  divisions  to  the  naval  infantry  and  the  coastal 
defense  forces.  This  position  alone  meant  that  on  February  14, 
1991,  the  date  when  the  Soviet  Union  submitted  its  updated  data, 
the  CFE  Treaty  was  at  an  impasse.  Some  believed  that  the  Soviet 
High  Command  wanted  to  stop  the  CFE  Treaty  ratification  pro¬ 
cess  cold  and  substitute  for  the  treaty  a  “status-quo”  military

While  the  old  system  was  untenable,  it

tary  power  and  a  major  CFE  Treaty  state  party. 
Following  the  Gulf  War,  President  Bush  began  a  series  of  arms 
control  initiatives.20  He  directed  Secretary  of  State  Baker  to  initiate 
diplomatic  discussions  with  Soviet  Foreign  Minister  Alexander  A. 
Bessmertnykh.  Baker  focused  on  resolving  both  the  CFE  Treaty 
impasse  and  the  outstanding  issues  of  the  still-unsigned  Strategic 
Arms  Reduction  Treaty  (START).  In  the  White  House,  President 
Bush  set  up  a  small,  high-level  experts  group  on  arms  control  to 
draft  presidential  letters  and  new  treaty  positions  and  to  formulate 
immediate  responses.  Led  by  Arnold  Kanter  of  the  National  Secu¬ 
rity  Council,  this  four-person  group  worked  closely  with  Secretary 
Baker,  Ambassador  Woolsey,  CFE  Treaty  Negotiator  Hansen,  and 
the  START  Treaty  negotiators.  Initially  there  was  little  change.  In 
March,  Soviet  Foreign  Minister  Bessmertnykh  met  with  Secretary 
Baker  in  Moscow.  He  asked  Baker  to  reconsider  the  United  States’ 
opposition  to  the  Soviet  High  Command’s  resubordination  of  CFE 
TLE  to  naval  and  coastal  defense  units.  Baker  replied:  “I  don’t 
know  what  there  is  to  talk  about.  Twenty-two  countries  have 
signed  this  treaty,  and  only  one  has  changed  the  rules.”21 


relationship  of  the  Soviet  Union  with  Central  and 
Western  European  nations. ls  If  this  were  true,  the 
Soviet  military’s  vision  proved  to  be  shortsighted 
in  view  of  subsequent  events. 

In  the  spring  and  summer  months  of  1991, 
the  Soviet  Union’s  internal  and  external  policies 
were  subject  to  larger  and  more  powerful  events. 
In  late  February,  a  United  Nations  coalition,  led 
by  the  United  States,  won  a  decisive  victory  in 
the  Gulf  War  over  Iraq,  a  former  Soviet  ally. 
Simultaneously,  in  late  January  and  February,  the 
people  of  the  Baltic  states  of  Estonia,  Latvia,  and 
Lithuania  rebelled  against  Soviet  imperialism.19 
Following  a  brief,  violent  confrontation,  they 
won  recognition  of  their  sovereignty  from  Mos¬ 
cow.  Then,  throughout  April,  May,  and  June, 
President  Gorbachev  and  the  Communist  central 
government  gradually  lost  power  to  Boris 
Yeltsin,  Russian  reformers,  and  nationalistic 
leaders  in  the  republics.  The  Soviet  High 
Command’s  desire  to  establish  a  Soviet-domi¬ 
nated  imperial  security  system  based  on  the 
military  status  quo  became  untenable  as  the 
Soviet  Union  unraveled  both  as  an  empire  and 
a  nation.

Next,  President  Bush  wrote  directly  to  President  Gorbachev 
asking  him  to  resolve  the  dispute  on  the  reassignment  of  the 
military  equipment.  Secretary  Baker  made  a  direct  appeal  to 
Bessmertnykh  in  Russia  in  late  April.  Neither  Bush’s  letter  nor 
Baker’s  personal  diplomacy  had  much  effect.  Then  in  late  May 
a  breakthrough  occurred.  President  Gorbachev  sent  General 
Moiseyev  to  Washington  for  a  two-day  meeting  with  the  president, 
senior  military  leaders,  and  treaty  negotiators.22  He  brought  with 
him  new  proposals.  General  Moiseyev  stated  the  Soviet  Union’s 
final  position:  all  equipment  in  the  Soviet  naval  infantry  and 
coastal  defense  forces  would  remain  in  their  units,  but  they  would 
be  counted  against  the  USSR’s  overall  CFE  Treaty  ceilings.  The 
number  of  armored  personnel  vehicles  assigned  to  the  Strategic 
Rocket  Forces  (SRF)  would  be  limited  to  1,701,  but  they  would 
not  be  counted  against  the  Soviet  Union’s  aggregate  number  of 
treaty  ACVs.  The  naval  forces  would  not  be  counted  as  OOVs, 
limiting  the  number  of  inspections  the  Soviets  would  be  liable  for, 
but  these  units  would  still  be  vulnerable  to  inspection  under  the 
challenge  inspection  provisions.  More  important,  the  naval  forces 
equipment  would  be  counted  in  Soviet  TLE  totals.  The  issue  of 
armored  personnel  vehicles  in  the  SRF  was  countered  somewhat 
by  the  U.S.  concern  for  the  security  of  Soviet  nuclear  materials  if 
the  Soviet  Union  became  less  stable.  After  consideration,  U.S. 
experts  accepted  the  Soviet  position.  The  next  day  General 
Moiseyev  met  with  President  Bush  in  the  White  House.  According 
to  a  recent  account,  President  Bush  was  insistent  and  very  firm  on 
the  United  States’  commitment  to  the  treaty  and  the  consequences 
of  any  nation  trying  to  back  out  at  this  late  stage.23  General 
Moiseyev  agreed,  stating  his  support  for  President  Gorbachev, 
perestroika,  and  arms  control.

The  CFE  Treaty  was  multilateral,  with  22  signatory 
nations;  no  one  could  deny,  however,  that  bilateral 
negotiations  had  resolved  this  treaty  impasse.  The 
United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union  acted  decisively,  but 
bilaterally,  in  reaching  these  settlements.  At  times  allies 
were  informed;  other  times  they  were  not.  Hungary, 
Poland,  Czechoslovakia,  and  Germany  complained  that 
the  United  States  and  the  USSR  were  settling  multilat¬ 
eral  treaty  issues  among  themselves.24  Yet  during  months 
of  turmoil  and  real  uncertainty,  U.S.  and  Soviet  political 
leaders  focused  again  and  again  on  the  CFE  Treaty;  their 
persistence  produced  results. 

It  was  only  a  matter  of  weeks  from  the  time  of 
General  Moiseyev’s  Washington  visit  in  May  1991  to 
the  USSR’s  formal  declaration  to  all  other  treaty  states 
in  Vienna.  In  early  June,  Secretary  Baker  and  Ambassa¬ 
dor  Woolsey  flew  to  Moscow  and  met  with  Foreign 
Minister  Bessmertnykh  and  Soviet  CFE  Treaty  Negotia¬ 
tor  Grinevsky.  The  result  was  a  complex,  three-part 
solution. 2i  First,  France,  as  a  CFE  Treaty  signatory  state, 
would  request  that  the  Netherlands  convene  an  extra¬ 
ordinary  conference  of  state  parties  to  the  treaty  at  The  Hague. 
Next,  the  Soviet  Union,  at  that  conference,  would  issue  a  legally 
binding  statement  explaining  the  obligations  it  would  undertake 
“outside  of  the  framework  of  the  treaty”  to  account  for  its  TLE 
holdings  within  the  treaty’s  area  of  application.  The  Soviet  Union 
would  declare  its  willingness  to  limit  the  equipment  in  its  naval 
infantry  forces,  coastal  defense  forces,  and  Strategic  Rocket  Forces 
to  the  exact  number  previously  announced  in  Vienna.  Then,  they 
would  declare  that  40  months  after  entry  into  force,  the  USSR’s 
maximum  TLE  holdings  would  include  the  total  TLE  assigned  to 
the  naval  infantry  forces,  coastal  defense  forces,  and  Strategic 
Rocket  Forces.  This  meant  that  the  Soviet  Union  would  reduce  an 
equivalent  number  of  TLE  elsewhere  to  meet  its  maximum  hold¬ 
ings.  Specifically,  the  Soviets  pledged  to  destroy  or  convert  933 
tanks,  1,725  ACVs,  and  1,080  artillery  pieces.  They  would  reduce 
one-half  of  the  933  tanks  and  1,080  artillery  pieces  from  forces 
within  the  ATTU  and  the  other  half  from  forces  east  of  the  Urals. 
The  Soviets  also  stated  that  they  would  modify  753  of  the  1,725 
ACVs  to  become  MTLB-AT  types.  These  were  “look-alikes”  and 
thus,  not  limited  by  the  treaty.26 

The  Soviets  were  adamant  in  their  position  that  the  coastal 
defense  forces  and  naval  infantry  units  were  not  OOVs  and  there¬ 
fore  not  subject  to  declared  site  inspections.  They  agreed,  however, 
that  this  equipment  would  be  subject  to  challenge  inspections. 

They  also  declared  that  they  would  limit  the  number  of  armored 
combat  vehicles  of  the  SRF,  but  that  these  limits  would  not  count 
against  the  total  number  of  ACVs  allocated  under  the  CFE  Treaty

to  the  Soviet  Union.  In  response  to  the  Soviet  Union’s  statement, 
each  of  the  other  21  states  at  the  extraordinary  conference  would 
issue  a  statement  accepting  the  Soviet  Union’s  declaration  as  le¬ 
gally  binding  and  the  basis  for  proceeding  toward  ratification  and 
implementation.  When  the  extraordinary  conference  convened  at 
The  Hague  on  June  18,  1991,  the  respective  ambassadors  read 
their  carefully  crafted,  legally  binding  statements  into  the  record 
and,  with  no  objections,  the  chairman  accepted  them  as  official 
treaty  documents.27 

On  the  issue  of  the  Soviet  military  equipment  positioned  east 
of  the  Ural  Mountains,  the  Soviet  government  presented  a  politi¬ 
cally  binding  statement  to  the  state  delegates  attending  the  CFE’s 
Joint  Consultative  Group  in  Vienna.  The  Soviet  Union  pledged  to 
destroy  or  convert  to  civilian  use  no  fewer  than  6,000  tanks,  1,500 
ACVs,  and  7,000  artillery  pieces  located  beyond  the  Ural  Moun¬ 
tains.  They  would  reduce  these  items  by  November  1995  in  such  a 
way  as  to  provide  “sufficient  visible  evidence”  of  their  destruction 
or  their  having  been  rendered  militarily  unsuitable.  Essentially,  the 
pledge  meant  that  the  Soviet  Union  would  display  this  equipment 
so  that  treaty  states  could  use  satellite  reconnaissance  to  monitor 
and  confirm  its  reduction.28

Once  these  Soviet  legal  and  political  statements  had  been 
accepted  as  official  treaty  documents,  most  of  the  CFE  Treaty 
signatory  states  turned  to  ratification.  President  Bush  submitted 
the  CFE  Treaty  to  the  U.S.  Senate  on  July  9,  1991,  stating,  “The 
CFE  Treaty  is  the  most  ambitious  arms  control  agreement  ever 
concluded.”29  He  declared  that  the  treaty  was  in  the  “best  inter¬ 
ests  of  the  United  States”  and  that  it  was  an  important  step  in 
“defining  the  new  security  regime  in  Europe.”  Other  states  went 
through  the  ratification  process  as  well.  Czechoslovakia  was  the 
first  nation  to  ratify  the  treaty  and  deposit  the  instruments  of 
ratification  in  the  treaty  depository  at  The  Hague.  Other  nations 
followed  and  by  the  end  of  1991,  14  nations,  including  Hungary, 
the  Netherlands,  Bulgaria,  United  Kingdom,  Poland,  Germany, 
and  the  United  States,  had  ratified  the  treaty.  Before  all  the  origi¬ 
nal  22  treaty  signatories  could  complete  the  ratification  process, 
however,  three  new  developments  influenced  the  treaty. 


The  Second  Crisis:  The  Baltic  States 

This  issue  dealt  with  the  legal  status  of  the  Soviet  Union’s 
TLE  in  the  three  Baltic  nations — Estonia,  Lithuania,  and  Latvia.30 
Resolution  came  expeditiously.  None  of  the  Baltic  states  wanted  to 
become  parties  to  the  CFE  Treaty.  None  wanted  the  Soviet  military 
forces,  which  they  considered  to  be  armies  of  occupation,  to  be 
stationed  permanently  on  their  national  territory.  They  were  con¬ 
cerned  that  any  treaty  participation  by  a  Baltic  state  would  lend 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


legitimacy  to  a  Soviet  presence  in  the  Baltics.  All  desired,  however, 
that  the  Soviet  Union’s  conventional  military  equipment  and  units 
subject  to  the  treaty  still  count  against  the  Soviet  Union’s  TLE 
ceilings  and,  if  possible,  be  reduced  in  accordance  with  the  proto¬ 
cols  of  the  treaty. 

Recognizing  the  Baltic  nations’  demands,  and  sensing  that  the 
Soviet  Foreign  Ministry  was  willing  to  discuss  a  diplomatic  solu¬ 
tion,  U.S.  diplomats  in  Moscow  informally  raised  the  possibility 
of  another  “agreed  statement”  regarding  the  Soviet  Union’s  CFE 
Treaty  obligations.  As  a  direct  consequence  of  this  bilateral  diplo¬ 
macy,  the  CFE  Treaty’s  Joint  Consultative  Group  convened  an¬ 
other  extraordinary  meeting  in  Vienna  on  October  18,  1991. 31  The 
chairman  read  statements  from  the  Soviet  Union  and  other  state 
parties  that  stipulated  that  the  three  Baltic  nations  were  not  parties 
to  the  CFE  Treaty  and  that  all  Soviet  TLE  on  the  territory  of  those 
states  would  count  against  the  USSR’s  treaty  ceilings.  Read  aloud 
to  the  assembled  state  delegates,  the  statements  were  accepted 
without  comment.  Following  procedure,  the  statements  were  sent 
to  the  treaty  depository  at  The  Hague  for  deposit  with  the  official 
treaty.32 

By  this  time  the  Soviet  Union  as  a  nation  was  in  a  tenuous 
state.  Its  government  had  barely  survived  a  failed  coup  d’etat  in 
mid-August,  its  ruling  Communist  party  had  been  outlawed,  and 


Soviet  forces  in  Moscow  during  failed  coup  attempt  in  August  1991.

its  national  leadership  appeared  incapable  of  stemming  the  twin 
forces  of  a  collapsing  empire  and  rising  nationalism.  By  December 
1991,  the  creation  of  an  independent  Ukraine  and  Belarus,  and  the 
establishment  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States,  sealed 
the  fate  of  the  USSR.  On  December  25,  1991,  the  USSR  formally 
dissolved  as  a  nation  and  was  replaced  by  15  newly  independent 
states.5'  Eight  of  these  new  states — Azerbaijan,  Armenia,  Belarus, 
Georgia,  Kazakstan,  Moldova,  Russia,  and  Ukraine — had  former 
Soviet  military  forces  and  units  stationed  on  their  territory  that 
were  subject  to  the  CFE  Treaty.  What  would  be  their  fate?  Would 
these  new  nations  simply  nationalize  the  military  forces  stationed 
on  their  territory?  Or  would  they  seek  to  join  the  all-European 
CFE  Treaty  and  commit  themselves  to  destroying  conventional 
military  equipment  that  could  be  used  by  their  new  armies  and  air 
forces?  And  under  what  aegis  would  they  discuss  joining  the  CFE 
Treaty  states?  They  were  not  members  of  any  international  forum 
such  as  the  CSCE,  Warsaw  Pact,  or  NATO.34 


The  Third  Crisis:  New  State  Parties 

On  December  8,  1991,  the  leaders  of  Russia,  Ukraine,  and 
Belarus  gathered  in  Minsk,  Belarus,  to  place  their  signatures  on  the 
document  creating  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States 
(CIS).  Within  a  week,  the  leaders  of  five  other  republics — 
Kazakstan,  Kyrgyzstan,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and 
Uzbekistan — had  met  in  Ashkhabad,  Turkmenistan,  and  pledged 
to  join  the  new  commonwealth.  All  the  military  forces  of  the  col¬ 
lapsing  Soviet  Union  would  be  placed  under  the  control  of  this 
commonwealth.  These  events  signaled  not  only  the  end  of  the 
Soviet  Union  as  a  nation  but  also  its  end  as  a  state  party  to  the 
CFE  Treaty.  In  Vienna,  the  CFE  state  delegates  sought  some 
mechanism  to  bring  the  new  republics  into  the  CFE  Treaty  orbit.5'1 

In  the  late  fall  of  1991,  a  new  pan-European  organization, 
the  North  Atlantic  Cooperation  Council  (NACC)  was  set  up  with 
U.S.  and  German  leadership.  By  December,  its  membership  con¬ 
sisted  of  the  16  NATO  nations,  Poland,  Czechoslovakia,  Hungary, 
Romania,  Bulgaria,  and  the  15  newly  independent  states  from  the 
former  Soviet  Union.  Shortly  after  the  creation  of  the  CIS  in 
December,  the  new  North  Atlantic  Cooperation  Council  invited  all 
member  states  to  meet  in  Brussels  at  NATO  headquarters  on  Janu¬ 
ary  10,  1992.  The  objective  was  to  convene  a  high  level  working 
group  to  discuss  the  future  of  the  CFE  Treaty.  Every  state  accepted 
and  attended,  with  the  exception  of  Kazakstan.  This  was  the  first 
time  the  new  CIS  nations,  represented  by  their  foreign  and  defense 
ministers,  had  been  at  NATO  headquarters.  At  this  historic  meet¬ 
ing,  they  participated  as  sovereign  independent  nations,  sitting 
beside  the  leaders  of  the  former  Warsaw  Pact  nations  and,  of 
course,  the  foreign  and  defense  ministers  of  the  NATO  nations.56

In  their  opening  statements,  the  foreign  ministers  of  the  newly 
independent  states  declared  that  the  CFE  Treaty  was  “the  corner¬ 
stone  of  European  security.”  In  his  statement,  Vladimir  Petrovskiy, 
the  Russian  representative,  asserted  that  only  Russia  needed  to 
ratify  the  CFE  Treaty.3"  He  said  that  Russia  would  subsequently 
negotiate  the  “necessary  adjustments”  with  the  other  republics.  All 
other  NACC  states  rejected  this  Russian  interpretation.  Instead, 
they  proposed  that  each  of  the  newly  independent  states  be  consid¬ 
ered  a  successor  state.  Furthermore,  following  signature  and  ratifi¬ 
cation,  each  would  become  an  original  state  party  to  the  treaty. 
This  concept  carried  the  day,  and  after  lengthy  discussion,  the 
delegates  agreed  on  the  following  points:38 

•  The  CFE  Treaty  should  enter  into  force  without  renegotiation 
and  should  be  fully  implemented  as  soon  as  possible. 

•  Treaty  obligations  of  the  former  USSR  should  be  wholly 
accounted  for  by  all  the  newly  independent  states  and  appor¬ 
tioned  among  them  in  a  manner  acceptable  to  all  parties  to 
the  treaty. 

•  All  newly  independent  states  in  the  area  of  application  of  the 
CFE  Treaty  should  ratify  the  treaty. 

•  Some  updating  of  the  treaty  would  be  necessary,  but  it  would 
be  done  after  its  entry  into  force.

•  The  deadline  for  entry  into  force  should  be  as  soon  as  pos¬ 
sible,  preferably  by  the  time  of  the  Helsinki  Review  Confer¬ 
ence  (March-July  1992). 

•  Further  work  by  the  high  level  working  group  was  war¬ 
ranted. 

The  NACC  high  level  working  group  met  again  in  February, 
March,  April,  and  May  of  1992.  These  were  extraordinary  months 
for  the  newly  independent  states.  First,  as  new  nations,  they  had  to 
define  their  relationships  with  the  nations  of  Central  and  Western 
Europe.  The  CFE  Treaty  lay  at  the  center  of  the  military  dimension 
of  this  relationship.  Second,  they  had  to  define  their  relationship 
with  Russia,  the  largest  and  most  powerful  of  the  former  Soviet 
republics.  Here  the  CFE  Treaty  was  also  a  focal  point,  since  it 
mandated  reductions  in  the  former  Soviet  Union’s  vast  arsenal  of 
conventional  weapons.  The  question  of  how  the  USSR’s  arsenal 
would  be  partitioned  among  the  sucessor  states,  and  then  how 
these  national  portions  would  be  subject  to  the  treaty,  had  to  be 
decided.  The  two  issues  were  related,  and  the  working  group 
resolved  them  in  the  first  six  months  of  1992. 

On  January  16,  1992,  Russia  proposed  at  a  CIS  meeting  in 
Minsk  that  it  should  receive  two-thirds  of  the  ground  weapons  of 
the  former  Soviet  Union.  At  that  meeting,  Valery  Shustov,  Russia’s 
CFE  Treaty  Negotiator,  declared  that  Russia  would  coordinate  the 
inspection,  escort,  and  reduction  activities  of  all  the  CIS  states 
implementing  the  CFE  Treaty.39  The  other  CIS  states,  especially 
Ukraine,  rejected  this  assertion.  Two  weeks  later,  on  January  30, 
the  Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE) 
admitted  10  CIS  states  as  members.  The  new  states  signed  letters 
pledging  to  “move  forward  promptly  with  the  ratification  of  the 
CFE  Treaty  and  to  assume  ...  all  CFE  obligations  of  the  former

Soviet  Union.”40  With  this  important  international  diplomatic  and 
political  act  completed,  the  CIS  nations  turned  to  the  tough  nego¬ 
tiations  on  partitioning  the  former  Soviet  Union’s  conventional 
armed  forces.  They  set  up  a  group  of  experts,  largely  consisting 
of  senior  military  officers,  who  examined  force  structure,  treaty 
ceilings,  and  treaty  reduction  requirements.  Throughout  February, 
March,  and  April  of  1992,  this  group  labored  to  devise  a  distribu¬ 
tion  formula  acceptable  to  all  states. 

It  was  not  easy.  At  one  point,  Leonid  Kravchuk,  then  Ukrai¬ 
nian  foreign  minister,  complained  about  the  CIS  nations’  failure  to 
resolve  the  CFE  Treaty  TLE  problem:  “Not  one  major  military 
question  has  been  resolved  ...  within  the  framework  of  the  Com¬ 
monwealth.”41  Then,  in  early  April,  the  Russian  Parliament  voted 
not  to  ratify  the  CFE  Treaty,  even  though  the  USSR  Supreme  So¬ 
viet  had  ratified  it  in  1991.  At  that  point,  President  Yeltsin  inter¬ 
vened,  stating  that  Russia  would  accept  all  treaty  obligations  of 
the  former  Soviet  Union.42  In  separate  actions,  the  leaders  of  Ar¬ 
menia  and  Azerbaijan  complained  that  they  should  be  allocated 
more  tanks  than  proposed  by  the  group  of  experts.  These  two 
nations  were  locked  in  an  intense  ethnic  war  over  separatist 
Nagorno-Karabakh;  consequently,  they  sought  more  conventional 
armaments. 


Amidst  these  internal  CIS  negotiations,  the  monthly  NACC 
meetings  of  the  foreign  ministers  at  NATO  headquarters  contin¬ 
ued.  These  meetings  put  pressure  on  Russia  and  the  other  succes¬ 
sor  states  to  divide  the  Soviet  Union’s  entitlements  and  obligations 
in  an  equitable  manner.  In  April  1992,  Ambassador  Lynn  M. 
Hansen,  the  U.S.  CFE  Treaty  Negotiator  who  had  replaced  Am¬ 
bassador  R.  James  Woolsey  in  June  1991,  led  a  small  delegation  to 
Minsk,  Kiev,  Chisinau,  and  Moscow  to  discuss  treaty  ratification 
and  implementation.43  On  this  same  trip,  Ambassador  Hansen’s 
delegation  met  in  Moscow  with  representatives  from  Armenia, 
Azerbaijan,  Georgia,  and  Kazakstan.  Over  the  course  of  10  days, 
Hansen  learned  that  all  the  newly  independent  states  had  the 
political  will  to  achieve  an  agreement  on  the  CFE  Treaty  TLE.  He 
also  discovered  that  the  smaller  states  distrusted  Russia’s  tactics 
and  attitudes.  Characteristically,  Hansen  went  directly  to  see  the 
Russian  first  deputy  foreign  minister;  they  discussed  ratification  of 
the  treaty.  Hansen  told  him  “an  agreement  was  there  for  the  tak¬ 
ing,  if  they  would  just  modify  the  way  they  negotiated.”44  The 
Russian  minister  listened,  but  action  would  not  come  until  mid- 
May. 

Finally,  following  further  CIS  negotiating  sessions  in  Moscow, 
Minsk,  Kiev,  and  other  capitals,  the  leaders  of  the  successor  states 
met  in  Tashkent,  Uzbekistan,  on  May  15,  1992.  There  they  signed 
an  agreement  on  the  division  of  the  former  Soviet  Union’s  CFE 
Treaty  obligations  and  entitlements.45  The  Russian  military  was

instrumental  in  devising  this  agreement;  without  their  detailed 
work  it  would  not  have  happened.  The  division  at  Tashkent  is 
detailed  in  table  3-3. 


With  the  Tashkent  accords  signed  on  May  15,  1992,  atten¬ 
tion  turned  to  Vienna  where  the  CFE  Treaty’s  Joint  Consultative 
Group  was  meeting  in  preparation  for  a  third  Extraordinary  Con¬ 
ference.  In  Vienna,  the  state  delegates  drafted  a  document,  to  be 
signed  on  June  5,  1992,  at  an  Extraordinary  Conference  in  Oslo. 
This  document  made  legal  both  the  entry  of  the  new  state  parties 
and  their  acceptance  of  all  the  obligations  and  entitlements  of  the 
former  USSR.  In  short  order,  the  JCG  delegates  and  technical 
specialists  drafted  new  treaty  annexes  containing  treaty  under¬ 
standings,  notifications,  confirmations,  and  commitments.  They 
incorporated  the  new  annexes  into  the  “Final  Document,”  which 
changed  the  wording  in  the  treaty  to  reflect  the  dissolution  of  the 
Soviet  Union  and  the  inclusion  of  eight  new  state  parties.  The 
Final  Document  set  a  deadline  of  July  1,  1992,  for  each  signatory 
state  to  provide  to  all  other  states  information  concerning  inspec¬ 
tions  and  verification.  In  addition,  it  stated  that  the  TLE  reduction 
liabilities  of  the  new  state  parties  collectively  would  be  no  different 
from  those  of  the  former  Soviet  Union.  It  also  reaffirmed  the  two 
previous  JCG  statements:  the  Soviet  Union’s  June  15,  1991,  state¬ 
ment  regarding  the  TLE  reassigned  to  the  naval  infantry  and 
coastal  defense  forces,  and  the  October  18,  1991,  Soviet  statement 
on  the  status  of  TLE  stationed  on  the  territory  of  the  three  Baltic 
nations.  Finally,  it  addressed  the  problem  of  stationing  armored

infantry  fighting  vehicles  (AIFVs)  on  the  flanks;  but  it  left  resolu¬ 
tion  to  the  JCG  forum  following  entry  into  force. 

All  of  these  changes  and  new  annexes  were  incorporated  into 
the  treaty,  translated  into  the  six  treaty  languages,  and  presented 
at  the  Oslo  Extraordinary  Conference.  There,  delegates  from  the 
now  29  signatory  states  signed  the  new  documents  on  June  5, 
1992.  The  CFE  Treaty  stipulated  that  from  that  moment  the  eight 
new  states  were  “original  state  parties”  and  that  each  assumed  the 
same  rights  and  obligations  that  every  other  state  party  had  under 
the  treaty.46 


The  Last  Crisis:  Final  Ratification 

Following  the  Oslo  conference,  attention  turned  to  complet¬ 
ing  ratification  and  exchanging  final  treaty  documents  at  the 
CSCE  summit  in  Helsinki  on  July  9-10,  1992.  Of  the  29  states 
that  were  party  to  the  treaty,  1 1  had  not  ratified  and  deposited 
their  instruments  of  ratification  at  The  Hague  as  of  mid-June.  As 
stipulated  by  the  treaty,  entry  into  force  would  occur  10  days  after 
all  the  states  had  deposited  their  ratification  articles.  Turkey  rati¬ 
fied  on  June  18,  Moldova  on  July  1,  and  Russia  on  July  8.  Five 
other  nations  deposited  their  ratification  articles  on  July  6,  8,  and 
9.  That  left  three  nations — Armenia,  Belarus,  and  Kazakstan — that 
would  not,  or  could  not,  act  in  time  for  the  CSCE  summit  in 
Helsinki,  slated  for  July  9-10.  Treaty  diplomats  in  Vienna  viewed 
this  inaction  as  disastrous;  the  26  states  that  had  completed  ratifi¬ 
cation  held  more  than  90  percent  of  the  treaty’s  TLE,  units,  terri¬ 
tory,  and  zones.  Further  delay  might  dissipate  the  momentum 
created  in  the  past  seven  months. 


“We  have  to  provisionally 
implement  the  whole  treaty.  ” 

— Ambassador  Lynn  M.  Hansen, 
U.S.  CFE  Treaty  Negotiator 


Over  the  next  10  days,  Ambassador  Hansen  and  the  other 
state  negotiators  in  Vienna  explained,  cajoled,  and  succeeded  in 
persuading  their  colleagues  to  accept  the  concept  of  provisional 
implementation  of  the  CFE  Treaty.  Meanwhile,  new  documents 


When  Ambassador  Hansen  returned  to  Vienna  from  Oslo 
in  mid-June,  he  realized  that  the  Helsinki  summit  might  be  held 
without  a  ratified  CFE  Treaty  and  no  entry  into  force.  “Near  panic 
struck,”  he  recalled.  “One  night,  in  the  middle  of  the  night,  I 
concluded  what  we  had  to  do.  I  said:  ‘We  have  to  provisionally 
implement  the  whole  treaty.’”47  For  a  multinational,  29-nation 
treaty,  this  was  a  radical  idea.  The  next  day  when  Hansen  called 
Washington  and  discussed  the  idea  with  U.S.  international  treaty 
lawyers,  “They  rejected  it  totally.”  Then,  he  recalled,  “We  had  a 
bit  of  a  screaming  match.”4*  Hansen  won;  but  the  president  and 
key  U.S.  senators  had  to  approve  the  concept  before  U.S.  officials 
could  discuss  it  with  the  NATO  allies  and  the  other  signatory 
nations.  When  the  secretary  of  state,  the  president,  and  the  sena¬ 
tors  approved,  events  moved  swiftly.

were  prepared  in  six  languages  for  the  29  states  to  approve  and 
sign  in  Helsinki.  On  July  10,  1992,  representatives  of  all  state 
parties  met  in  Helsinki  for  the  fourth  extraordinary  conference  on 
the  CFE  Treaty.  They  signed  three  documents.  In  the  first,  the 
individual  states  agreed  to  provisionally  implement  the  CFE 
Treaty.  In  the  second,  the  individual  states  affirmed  the  relation¬ 
ship  between  the  CFE  Treaty  and  the  CFE  1A  agreement,  officially 
titled:  The  Concluding  Act  of  the  Negotiations  on  Personnel 
Strength  of  the  Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe.  Essentially, 
CFE  1A  was  a  “political”  statement  by  each  of  the  treaty  states 
declaring  that  they  would  not  exceed  self-imposed  limits  on  mili¬ 
tary  manpower  strength.  The  limits  were,  in  fact,  quite  high.  Con¬ 
sequently,  the  treaty’s  national  manpower  figures  were  not  as 
significant  as  the  fact  that  they  were  declared  in  a  politically  bind¬ 
ing  treaty.  These  figures  were  subject  to  monitoring  and  question¬ 
ing,  and  if  exceeded,  the  guilty  states  would  be  subject  to  interna¬ 
tional  censure.  This  was  the  first  time  in  the  twentieth  century  that 
the  European  nations,  acting  collectively,  had  agreed  to  limits  on 
their  national  military  forces.  In  the  third  document,  each  signa¬ 
tory  state  declared  it  would  provisionally  implement  the  CFE  1A 
Concluding  Act.  Then,  and  only  then,  could  treaty  implementation 
begin.49 

These  actions  set  the  clock  running  on  entry  into  force,  but 
they  did  not  complete  the  formal  ratification  process.  Armenia 
deposited  its  ratified  CFE  Treaty  instruments  at  The  Hague  on 
October  12,  1992.  Belarus  and  Kazakstan  completed  the  group  of 
original  states  by  depositing  their  instruments  of  ratification  on 
October  30.  Ten  days  later,  on  November  9,  the  CFE  Treaty  and 
the  CFE  1A  Concluding  Act  officially  entered  into  force.50 


Summing  Up 

It  had  taken  24  months — November  1990  to  November 
1992 — to  move  from  treaty  signature  through  the  national  ratifi¬ 
cations  to  official  entry  into  force.  Along  the  way  a  series  of 
treaty-related  crises  had  been  resolved:  TLE  relocations,  re¬ 
subordinations,  reclassifications,  new  state  parties,  redistribution 
of  the  former  USSR’s  entitlements  and  obligations,  and  new  na¬ 
tional  manpower  ceilings.  But  the  larger,  more  serious  crisis  of  the 
Soviet  Union’s  collapse  struck  at  the  existence  of  the  CFE  Treaty. 
In  the  face  of  turmoil  and  revolution,  German,  French,  American, 
Russian,  British,  and  Central  European  leaders  and  diplomats  had 
fought  hard  to  retain  the  treaty.  Throughout  these  difficulties,  the 
CFE  Treaty  retained  its  importance  for  the  future  of  Europe.  With 
treaty  operations  about  to  start,  attention  turned  to  the  national 
inspection  agencies  and  their  inspectors  who  would  monitor  the 
treaty,  and  the  military  services  that  would  reduce  and  account  for 
thousands  of  items  of  treaty-limited  equipment.

For  the  United  States,  the  On-Site  Inspection  Agency  had  the 
mission  of  conducting  the  CFE  Treaty  inspections  and  escorts. 
During  the  long  and  arduous  two-year  ratification  process,  OSIA’s 
European  Operations  Command  underwent  what  Colonel 
Lawrence  Kelley,  Chief  of  Operations,  called  “Standing  Up  the 
Unit.”

Chapter  4 


OSIA’s  operations  expand  significantly  throughout  Europe  in  preparation  for  the  CEE  Treaty. 


OSIA’s  European  Operations  Command: 

The  Year  of  Expansion,  1991 

The  major  influx  of  people  into  OSIA’s  European  Operations 
Command  began  in  January  1991.  Thirty  people  arrived 
that  month,  primarily  filling  support  positions,  but  includ¬ 
ing  nine  weapons  specialists.  Most  of  the  January  arrivals  came 
from  units  in  Europe.  A  month  later,  OSIA  European  Operations 
had  doubled  in  size,  expanding  from  27  to  57.  By  the  end  of  April, 
18  more  people  had  arrived,  including  Lt.  Colonel  David  P. 
Gessert,  USAF,  the  first  of  the  CFE  Treaty  team  chiefs.  Through 
July  another  18  had  come  on  board,  and  by  the  end  of  1991,  more 
than  100  personnel  were  on  duty.  All  CFE  inspection  team  mem¬ 
bers,  except  for  one  weapons  specialist,  two  linguists,  and  two 
deputy  team  chiefs,  were  in  some  phase  of  treaty  training.  As 
people  continued  to  arrive,  the  number  and  precise  function  of 
U.S.  liaison  officers  remained  unresolved.  OSIA  would  not  have 
final  answers  on  liaison  officers  until  mid-1992,  just  before  the 
treaty  entered  into  force.1

On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


Colonel  Fred  Grosick,  Commander,  and  Colonel  Lawrence 
Kelley,  Director  of  Operations,  shaped  the  rapidly  expanding  CFE 
inspection  force  around  three  key  operational  concepts.  The  first 
was  knowledge  of  the  treaty,  especially  its  inspection  protocol.  The 
treaty  was  the  “alpha  and  omega”  of  the  inspectors’  training, 
preparation,  and  operational  mission.  Over  and  over  in  small  team 
meetings  and  in  individual  sessions,  Colonel  Kelley  stressed  the 
importance  of  knowing  the  treaty  “inside  and  out,  chapter  and 
verse,”  because  the  “other  side  would.”  Kelley’s  long  experience 
with  the  Soviet/Russian  officer  corps  had  made  him  aware  of  their 
professionalism,  thoroughness  of  preparations,  suspicion  of  for¬ 
eigners,  and  their  insistence  on  the  letter  of  the  law  in  granting 
treaty  rights  to  inspectors.  If  inspectors  from  other  nations  knew 
the  treaty  well,  Kelley  and  Grosick  believed  that  U.S.  inspectors 
had  to  know  the  provisions  of  the  treaty  even  better. 

The  second  concept  placed  extraordinary  personal  responsi¬ 
bility  on  the  team  leader  for  each  inspection/escort  mission.  Care¬ 
fully  chosen,  personally  interviewed,  and  continuously  observed, 
these  Army  and  Air  Force  field  grade  officers  were  responsible  for 
their  team,  the  mission,  and  the  exercise  of  the  U.S.  government’s 
CFE  Treaty  rights  and  entitlements.  Colonel  Kelley  interviewed 
each  new  team  chief  when  he  reported  to  OSIA’s  European  Opera¬ 
tions  Command.  It  was,  by  all  accounts,  an  intense  session,  com¬ 
bining  a  treaty  tutorial  with  a  lecture  on  leadership  and  personal 
standards  of  conduct.  It  also  included  a  detailed  explanation  of  the 
U.S.  objectives  in  implementing  the  CFE  Treaty.  It  was  neither 
subtle  nor  collegial;  it  was  a  serious  meeting.  Colonel  Kelley  later 
recalled  that  at  some  point  he  would  tell  the  new  CFE  team  chief, 

“I  wanted  to  have  confidence  that  when  the  going  got  tough,  when 
the  team  had  not  slept  for  24  hours,  when  team  members  felt  ill, 
when  the  pressure  was  on,  the  temperature  was  low,  the  plan  had 
fallen  apart,  the  team  personnel  were  not  performing  as  expected, 
the  Russians  were  applying  pressure,  and  the  team  chief  encoun¬ 
tered  a  point  in  the  inspection  which  had  not  been  anticipated, 
that  I  could  still  trust  his  judgment.  Would  he  make  the  right 
call?”  These  standards  of  leadership  set  the  tone  for  the  developing 
inspection  organization. 

The  third  concept  was  integral  inspection  teams.  The  “inspec¬ 
tion  team”  was  the  primary  operational  unit  for  inspections  under 
the  CFE  Treaty.  Teams  would  have  designated  leaders,  perma¬ 
nently  assigned  inspectors,  and  specific  training  programs  designed 
to  build  treaty  knowledge,  team  cohesiveness,  and  team  recogni¬ 
tion  of  inspection  objectives.  Here  too  Kelley  and  Grosick  knew 
what  they  wanted:  inspection  team  identity,  inspector  allegiance  to 
the  team,  and  absolute  standards  of  conduct  by  all  team  members. 
“I  have  always  been,”  Kelley  said,  “a  firm  believer  in  unit  cohe¬ 
siveness.  So  I  consciously  set  the  teams  up  that  way,  and  insisted 
that  they  work  as  units,  and  act  as  units.”  Given  these  three  clear,

fixed  concepts,  the  new  inspection  team  leaders  and  inspectors 
entered  a  rigorous,  detailed  training  program.2 

Initial  Training 

The  CFE  Treaty  on-site  inspections  would  be  challenging 
because  the  mission  required  different  people  to  bring  various 
skills  together  in  a  team  effort.  Team  chiefs,  deputies,  linguists, 
and  weapons  specialists  all  needed  individual  and  small  team 
training  to  develop  and  refine  their  specific  skills.  It  was  also  im¬ 
portant  for  those  in  support  positions  to  fully  understand  their 
contribution  to  the  success  of  the  mission.  The  range  of  training 
topics  was  broad,  including  several  courses  on  the  treaty  and  its 
protocols,  three  levels  of  instruction  on  equipment  identification, 
and  several  Russian  language  courses.  Individual  training,  like 
improving  language  skills,  was  important,  but  as  individual  needs 
were  met,  the  focus  shifted  to  team  training. 

Both  in  personal  and  team  training,  knowledge  of  the  treaty 
formed  the  cornerstone  for  all  training.  The  CFE  Treaty  Inspector/ 
Escort  Course  was  the  fundamental  course  for  everyone.  The  first 
CFE  Treaty  course  was  taught  February  4-14,  1991,  at  the  De¬ 
fense  Intelligence  College  in  Washington,  D.C.  Bill  Parsons  and 
David  Sloss,  members  of  the  U.S.  Arms  Control  and  Disarmament 
Agency  and  active  participants  in  CFE  negotiations,  provided  25 
hours  of  instruction  on  the  treaty  and  its  protocols.  Experts  from 
the  U.S.  Army  Foreign  Science  and  Technology  Center  contributed 
15  hours  of  treaty-limited  equipment  (TLE)  familiarization.  This 
initial  course  also  dealt  with  topics  such  as  the  history  of  arms 
control,  Warsaw  Pact  forces,  Congress  and  treaty  ratification, 
health,  and  public  affairs.  Inspectors  assigned  to  OSIA’s  European 


Training  was  continuous  at  OSIA’s  European  Operations  Command ;  here  Colonel  Kelley

Operations  Command  would  receive  significantly  more  training 
after  the  course.  This  included  a  three-tiered  program  on  equip¬ 
ment  recognition  developed  by  and  for  inspectors. 

Twenty  people  from  OSIA’s  European  Operations  attended 
the  first  CFE  Treaty  course  in  Washington,  D.C.,  along  with  170 
others  from  Headquarters  OSIA  and  other  agencies.  In  April  1991, 
OSIA’s  European  Operations  Command  sponsored  a  CFE  Treaty 
course  for  an  additional  90  people  at  Rhein-Main  Air  Base  in 
Frankfurt,  Germany.  By  October  1991,  24  other  inspection  team 
members  had  completed  a  two-week  CFE  Treaty  course  sponsored 
by  NATO  at  Oberammergau,  Germany.  Colonel  Kelley  drew  from 
his  experience  with  the  Intermediate-Range  Nuclear  Forces  (INF) 
Treaty  to  design  the  NATO  course.  The  objective  was  to  establish 
CFE  Treaty  inspection  standards  across  the  NATO  group  of  states. 
Instructors  from  OSIA’s  European  Operations  focused  on  inspec¬ 
tion  and  escort  techniques  based  on  the  U.S.  experience  under  the 
INF  Treaty.  On  April  8,  1992,  OSIA  presented  a  five-day  CFE 
Treaty  course  in  Washington,  D.C.  Treaty  negotiators  and  experi¬ 
enced  OSIA  European  Operations  officers  and  noncommissioned 
officers  (NCOs)  taught  the  course,  focusing  on  the  treaty  and  the 
inspection  process.  A  videotaped  version  of  this  April  course  al¬ 
lowed  newly  assigned  inspectors  to  receive  the  required  training 
without  waiting  for  another  formal  class.  The  treaty  course  re¬ 
mained  the  fundamental  building  block,  but  it  was  only  one  re¬ 
quired  element  to  qualify  as  a  CFE  inspector/escort.3 


The  U.S.  Military  Liaison  Mission 
in  Potsdam,  Germany,  was  a 
primary  source  for  CFE  inspectors. 


When  treaty  ratification  lagged  in  the  fall  of  1991,  teams 
were  able  to  build  more  inspection-related  issues  into  their  training 
program.  The  Inspection/Escort  Branch  assembled  inspection 
teams  weekly.  The  teams  reviewed  and  discussed  treaty  inspection 
and  reduction  protocols,  standardized  inspection  and  reporting 
procedures,  and  studied  current  presidential  and  Joint  Chiefs  of 
Staff  (JCS)  guidance.  Individually,  each  team  trained  daily  on  the 
treaty  and  its  protocols.  They  discussed  inspection  scenarios  they 
might  confront  and  worked  through  problems  they  might  encoun¬ 
ter.  In  addition,  TLE  recognition  was  a  part  of  each  team’s  daily 
regime. 


Equipment  Recognition  Training 

A  group  of  Army  weapons  specialists  who  came  to  OSIA’s 
European  Operations  Command  on  a  temporary  basis  beginning 
in  October  of  1990  played  a  key  role  in  the  TLE  recognition  train¬ 
ing  program.  Sergeant  First  Class  George  A.  Partridge,  Staff  Ser¬ 
geant  Thomas  A.  Favia,  and  Sergeant  Joseph  S.  Nelson  were  mem¬ 
bers  of  the  U.S.  Military  Liaison  Mission  in  Potsdam,  Germany. 
The  Mission  was  staffed  by  NCOs  and  foreign  area  officers 
(FAOs)  with  a  strong  working  knowledge  of  Soviet  and  East  Ger¬ 
man  armies,  their  equipment,  units,  and  force  structure.  Because  of

German  unification,  however,  this  Cold  War  outpost  was  no 
longer  needed  and  was  closing.  Having  served  at  the  Mission, 
Colonel  Kelley  knew  the  caliber  of  the  people  associated  with  it 
and  its  reputation  for  excellence.  He  made  a  point  of  actively 
recruiting  weapons  specialists  from  the  Mission. 

These  specialists  contributed  immediately  to  the  command. 
They  laid  the  groundwork  for  OSIA’s  European  Operations’  equip¬ 
ment  recognition  program.  From  October  1990  through  January 
1991,  while  still  assigned  to  the  Mission  in  Potsdam,  they  devel¬ 
oped  courses  on  treaty-related  ground  equipment  and  conducted 
training  classes.  They  traveled  from  Berlin  to  work  at  Rhein-Main 
during  the  week,  returning  home  to  Berlin  on  weekends.  They 
acquired  photos  and  slides  of  Soviet  and  Warsaw  Pact  forces’ 
treaty-related  equipment.  Their  sources  were  within  the  Depart¬ 
ment  of  Defense,  other  U.S.  government  agencies,  NATO  allies, 
commercial  publications,  and  from  the  training  kits  they  had 
developed  at  the  Mission.  They  also  took  their  own  photos  of 
treaty-related  equipment  during  mock  inspections  and  on  field 
trips. 

Weapons  specialists  from  the  Army  and  Air  Force  later  joined 
the  specialists  from  the  Mission  and  added  to  the  growing  stock  of 
information.  Sergeant  First  Class  Curtis  E.  Ingram,  USA,  focused 
his  efforts  on  tanks  while  Master  Sergeant  Richard  D.  DiFormato, 
USA,  gathered  information  on  armored  combat  vehicles,  and  Staff 
Sergeants  Gilbert  Sierra,  Jr.,  and  Cecil  F.  Ward,  USA,  concentrated 
on  artillery.  The  U.S.  inspection  teams  also  required  a  working 
knowledge  of  treaty-related  aircraft  and  helicopters.  Senior  Master 
Sergeant  Clifford  A.  Schroder,  USAF,  and  Technical  Sergeants  Paul 
R.  Angus  and  James  F.  Towne,  USAF,  provided  that  expertise. 
Their  knowledge  of  aircraft  and  helicopters  complemented  the 
information  their  Army  counterparts  had  assembled.  The  weapons

specialists’  collection  of  information  and  photographs  were  the 
basis  for  a  three-level  training  program  on  equipment  identifica¬ 
tion.4 

Level  one  covered  10  categories  of  equipment:  tanks,  ar¬ 
mored  personnel  carriers  (APCs),  armored  infantry  fighting  ve¬ 
hicles  (AIFVs),  heavy  armament  combat  vehicles,  artillery,  combat 
aircraft,  helicopters,  mortars,  armored  vehicle  launched  bridges, 
and  multiple-launch  rocket  systems.  There  were  also  subdivisions 
in  several  categories;  helicopters  for  example,  could  be  broken 
down  into  three  categories — attack,  support,  and  transport.  Level 
one  training,  a  requirement  for  inspector  certification,  enabled 
inspectors  to  identify  all  Soviet,  Eastern  European,  and  U.S.  TLE. 

Level  two  training  dealt  with  Soviet,  Eastern  European,  and 
U.S.  equipment,  listed  in  the  Protocol  on  Existing  Types  of  Con¬ 
ventional  Armaments  and  Equipment,  that  was  reportable  but  not 
limited  under  the  treaty.  Instructors  broke  this  equipment  down 
into  17  areas.  This  equipment  included  “look-alike”  armored 
personnel  carriers  and  armored  infantry  fighting  vehicles,  training 
aircraft,  combat  support  helicopters,  and  transport  helicopters. 
The  armored  look-alikes  were  vehicles  built  on  the  chassis  of  a 
treaty-limited  vehicle  but  modified  for  purposes  other  than  trans¬ 
porting  a  combat  infantry  squad.  By  treaty  definition,  these  modi¬ 
fied  vehicles  could  not  be  armed  with  a  20  millimeter  or  greater 
gun  or  cannon.  The  two  levels  of  training  encompassed  more  than 
400  pieces  of  Soviet,  Eastern  European,  and  U.S.  equipment. 

Level  three  training  differed  from  the  other  two  levels  cover¬ 
ing  equipment  not  listed  in  the  treaty.  Although  not  limited  to 
weapons  specialists,  level  three  training  was  geared  to  maximizing 
weapons  specialists’  capabilities,  whereas  levels  one  and  two  were 
for  all  team  members.  Level  three  dealt  with  recognition  and  iden-

tification  of  the  thousands  of  pieces  of  Soviet,  Eastern  European, 
or  U.S.  equipment  that  a  team  might  encounter  during  an  inspec¬ 
tion.  This  equipment  varied  from  communications  vans  to  engi¬ 
neering  vehicles  to  motorcycles.  Training  would  enable  an  inspec¬ 
tor  to  make  more  accurate  observations  about  the  inspected  unit’s 
mission  and  status.  Training  also  included  order  of  battle,  organi¬ 
zational  structures,  and  equipment  markings.  Level  three  training 
could  vary  to  prepare  inspectors  for  a  particular  mission.  Inspec¬ 
tors  supplemented  their  classroom  training  on  weapons  identifica¬ 
tion  with  field  trips  to  locations  with  large  concentrations  of 
equipment.  Teams  traveled  to  the  U.S.  Air  Forces  in  Europe 
(USAFE)  Combat  Threat  Facility  at  Einsiedlerhof,  Germany,  to 
U.S.  Army  Europe’s  (USAREUR’s)  Hohenfels  Training  Area,  Ger¬ 
many,  and  to  other  NATO  sites.  These  trips  provided  inspectors 
direct  experience  with  Soviet  and  Eastern  European  equipment,  as 
well  as  U.S.  and  allied  equipment.  As  development  of  the  different 
levels  of  training  progressed,  however,  a  problem  arose  concerning 
space  to  conduct  the  training.5 

Rhein-Main,  normally  an  active  and  somewhat  congested 
base,  served  as  a  focal  point  for  tons  of  supplies,  equipment,  and 
thousands  of  troops  headed  for  the  Middle  East  in  support  of 
Operations  Desert  Shield  and  Desert  Storm.  Facilities  on  Rhein-

Main  were  at  a  premium.  The  OSIA  facilities  at  the  Air  Force  base 
were  taxed  heavily  by  OSIA’s  increased  manning  and  equipment  to 
implement  the  CFE  Treaty.  Weapons  specialists  did  not  have  ad¬ 
equate  facilities  to  conduct  equipment  recognition  classes.  The 
solution  to  their  problem  came  from  the  man  who  would  become 
the  first  OSIA  CFE  team  chief. 


Although  not  yet  assigned  to  OSIA,  Lt.  Colonel  David  P. 
Gessert,  USAF,  offered  the  use  of  his  squadron’s  facilities,  which 
were  adjacent  to  OSIA  European  Operations’  building.  Colonel 
Gessert  commanded  the  Air  Force’s  7580th  Aerospace  Squadron, 
known  as  the  Berlin  Corridor  Flyers.  Its  mission  ended  with  Ger- 


Lt.  Colonel  David  P.  Gessert,  USAF 

Lt.  Colonel  David  P.  Gessert,  USAF,  was  the  first  CFE  team 
chief  selected  at  OSIA’s  European  Operations  Command.  An  Air 
Force  Academy  graduate,  he  was  a  command  navigator  with 
3,000  flying  hours.  Just  prior  to  this  assignment,  Lt.  Colonel 
Gessert  had  commanded  the  Air  Force’s  7580th  Squadron,  the 
Berlin  Corridor  Flyers. 


On  the  initial  months — recruiting,  training,  en¬ 
listed  force:  “I  was  the  first  team  chief  here.  My 
deputy,  Chief  Warrant  Officer  Mike  Lukes,  was 
an  old  INF  Treaty  inspector;  he  had  a  lot  of 
experience.  In  all  honesty,  he  probably  trained  me 
more  than  anybody  else  did.  He  and  I  went  out 
as  the  team  chief  and  deputy  for  all  the  initial 
NATO  mock  inspections.  We  had  the  opportunity 
to  take  out  all  of  the  enlisted  teams.  There  were 
four  enlisted  members  on  each  team,  and  we  had 
eight  teams.  There  were  two  interpreters  and  two 
weapons  specialists,  and  it  was  a  mix  and  match 
of  Air  Force  and  Army  guys.  Chief  Lukes  and  I 
essentially  set  the  teams  up  and  initiated  their 
training.  The  first  real  mock  inspection  we  did 
was  with  the  French,  and  we  took  our  teams  out 
and  escorted  the  French;  then  we  worked  with  the 
Luxembourgers,  Belgians,  Dutch,  and  Germans. 


“We  had  all  these  extremely  qualified  NCOs, 
but  they  were  either  qualified  in  rocket  systems  or 
they  were  qualified  in  tanks,  master  gunners,  etc. 
We  also  had  some  very,  very  qualified  Air  Force 
maintenance  personnel  who  worked  on  F-4s  or 


F-15s  or  F-llls,  but  they  didn’t  know  tanks,  our 
own  tanks,  let  alone  Russian  tanks.  So  we  were 
pretty  much  starting  at  ground  zero.  Everybody 
was  extremely  professional;  there  was  real  exper¬ 
tise  in  certain  fields,  but  no  one  had  expertise  in 
all  of  the  Russian  equipment,  or  in  the  variety  of 
Russian  equipment.  What  helped  was  that  these 
guys  were  professional  NCOs,  and  they  were 
operators.  They  knew  how  to  turn  a  wrench,  so 
they  weren’t  guys  who  just  looked  at  pictures 
from  behind  a  desk  or  some  intelligence  analysts. 
These  guys  were  soldiers,  they  knew  how  to  walk 
into  a  wing,  a  brigade,  or  a  regiment,  and  decide 
quickly  if  they  had  their  act  together  or  not. 
That’s  why  they  were  hired.  So  we  had  all  these 
real  smart  guys,  soldiers  and  airmen.  These  guys 
could  walk  and  chew  gum;  they’d  done  some 
stuff  in  their  life.”

man  unification.  While  closing  down  the  7580th,  he  allowed 
OSIA’s  weapons  specialists  to  develop  and  conduct  equipment 
identification  classes  in  the  squadron’s  briefing  rooms.  These 
classes,  while  important  for  all  inspectors,  were  critical  for  weap¬ 
ons  specialists  because  none  were  expert  on  all  weapons  systems. 
U.S.  Air  Force  weapons  specialists,  for  example,  knew  U.S.  air¬ 
craft,  but  they  had  little  or  no  knowledge  of  U.S.  Army  weapons 
and  equipment,  much  less  the  weapons  of  the  Warsaw  Pact’s 
ground  forces.  The  same  was  true  for  U.S.  Army  weapons  special¬ 
ists,  who  were  expert  in  U.S.  and  some  Soviet  ground  forces,  albeit 
using  NATO  designations,  but  had  little  exposure  to  U.S.  and 
Soviet  aircraft.6 


continued 

On  the  initial  mock  inspections:  “The  initial 
mock  inspections  were  very  brutal,  especially 
with  our  allies.  The  allies  looked  at  this  CFE 
mission  initially  as  an  opportunity  to  talk  and  to 
celebrate  together.  From  our  own  INF  experience, 
we  knew  that  the  Russians  were  very  profes¬ 
sional,  and  that  we  had  to  approach  it  that  way. 
We  exercised  every  aspect  of  the  treaty  and  made 
it  very,  very  tough  and  very,  very  difficult.  The 
allies,  at  first,  regretted  it.  They  didn’t  like  it. 

They  didn’t  think  the  Americans  were  nice.  What 
we  tried  to  explain  to  them  was  that  you  train 
harder  than  what  you  actually  do  in  reality.  By 
the  time  the  inspections  began,  I  think  the  allies 
became  tougher  and  we  became  easier.  But  when  I 
say  easier,  it’s  because  we  were  not  reasonable  in 
our  mocks,  for  we  always  pushed  to  the  extreme 
to  make  treaty  points.  Many  times  we  would 
purposely  be  unreasonable  with  the  allies  for 
training  purposes. 

“Mock  inspections  taught  you  how  to  orches¬ 
trate  an  inspection,  how  to  organize  an  inspec¬ 
tion,  the  mechanics  of  trying  to  get  a  crew  of 
eight  people  underneath  the  team  chief  to  work 
together  as  subteams.  You  did  it  so  that  when  you 
hit  the  ground  you  weren’t  worried  about  who 
had  what  room  or  where’s  the  equipment  going. 
You  had  to  learn  how  do  to  the  mechanical  things 
to  make  an  inspection  work.  When  you  hit  the 
site,  your  time  was  very  limited.  You  had  to  use  it 
wisely. 


“It  takes  organization  and  some  thought.  I 
believe  I’ve  used  the  example  before  that  we 
learned  that  it  takes  a  much  longer  time  to  do  a 
treaty  inspection  report  than  ever  anticipated 
because  of  the  legal  aspects,  using  the  proper 
verbiage,  and  referencing  the  proper  points  in  the 
treaty.  These  things  just  took  longer  than  antici¬ 
pated.  There  are  also  some  straight  mechanical 
things  you  have  to  do  to  facilitate  and  to  keep 
your  inspection  going.” 

On  leading  multinational  inspection  teams:  “I 
think  that  actually  made  the  mocks  more  impor¬ 
tant.  Learning  how  to  put  together  and  orches¬ 
trate  an  inspection  with  three  new  people  helped. 
We  always  have  three  new  people  on  every  one  of 
our  real  inspections,  in  addition  to  the  core  six- 
man  team.  During  the  mock  inspections  we 
learned  how  to  make  it  work.  How  to  make  it 
task-oriented,  to  know  what  task  you  want  to 
give  to  a  new  member,  and  what  you  want  to  give 
to  an  experienced  inspector.  You  learned  how  to 
organize  and  how  to  set  up  a  true,  thorough 
inspection.  Sometimes  it  was  very,  very  tough 
because  you  had  to  learn  how  to  use  somebody 
from  another  country  who  had  a  slightly  different 
agenda  than  yours.  But  if  you  know  how  to  facili¬ 
tate  an  inspection,  how  to  organize — which  we 
learned  during  the  mock  regime — it  made  it  much 
easier.  That’s  what  the  training  really  taught  us  to 
do,  how  to  conduct  a  good,  well-orchestrated, 
well-organized  inspection.  And  it  took  a  while  to 
learn  that.  You  don’t  go  into  it  blindly.”

Training  for  Linguists 

While  weapons  specialists  developed  their  lesson  plans  in 
equipment  identification,  linguists  had  their  own  training  require¬ 
ments.  Once  selected  for  duty  with  OSIA,  most  linguists  attended 
the  Defense  Language  Institute’s  (DLI)  Intermediate  Russian 

Course  in  Monterey,  California.  The  27-week 
course  provided  linguists  intense  training  to 
expand  their  ability  to  speak  Russian.  The  course 
also  introduced  students  to  arms  control  treaty 
terminology.  After  successful  completion  of  the 
DLI  course 

Operations,  and  shortly  thereafter  attended  a 
two-week  course  at  the  U.S.  Army  Russian  Insti¬ 
tute  (USARI)  at  Garmisch,  Germany.  This  course, 
sponsored  by  the  Treaty  Verification  Division  of 
USARI,  put  linguists  into  classrooms  where  they 
spoke  only  Russian  as  they  studied  terminology 
specific  to  the  CFE  Treaty.  Freed  from  the  daily 
pressures  and  distractions  of  individual  and  team 
training  at  Rhein-Main,  students  at  Garmisch 
focused  on  the  treaty’s  complex,  technical  lan¬ 
guage  for  six  to  seven  hours  a  day.  Back  at  Rhein-Main,  in  addi¬ 
tion  to  individual  daily  practice,  linguists  gathered  in  small  groups 
led  by  Alan  J.  French,  OSIA  European  Operations’  in-house  Rus¬ 
sian  language  professional.  They  drilled  in  Russian  three  to  five 
hours  a  week,  for  practice  in  conversation  and  interpretation. 
Linguists  enhanced  their  training  by  viewing  taped  Russian  televi¬ 
sion  broadcasts  and  reading  any  available  written  materials.  Most 
linguists  agreed,  however,  that  the  most  realistic  training  for  the 
inspection  teams,  short  of  an  actual  treaty  inspection,  was  the 
mock  inspections.7

One  lesson  Americans  had  learned  in  preparing  to  implement 
the  INF  Treaty  was  that  mock  inspections  were  an  extremely 
valuable  training  tool.  These  inspections  enabled  teams  to  practice 
inspection  and  escort  procedures,  make  and  correct  mistakes  on 
the  spot,  uncover  unanticipated  problems  or  situations,  and  im¬ 
prove  their  procedures  in  accordance  with  treaty  protocols.  Teams 
went  beyond  scenario  development  and  discussion  in  their  offices 
to  exercising  their  treaty  knowledge  at  an  inspectable  site  on  a 
military  installation.8  Seventeen  months  into  treaty  implementa¬ 
tion,  Lt.  Colonel  Joseph  J.  Drach,  Jr.,  USA,  an  experienced  OSIA 
CFE  Treaty  team  chief,  led  a  series  of  training  classes  and  a  mock 
inspection  with  Moldovan  inspectors  in  December  1993.  He  told 
the  Moldovan  team  about  the  approach  American  inspectors  took 
during  mock  inspections:

“Our  experiences  during  the  mock  inspections  before  baseline 
and  during  the  real  treaty  inspections,  both  inspecting  and  escort¬ 
ing,  were  very  similar.  This  (fact)  indicates  that  our  level  of  realism 
during  training  was  very  high.  That  is  always  one  of  the  main 
goals  in  training,  to  train  the  way  you  would  fight,  to  be  as  realis¬ 
tic  as  you  can.”9 


Initial  OSIA  mock  inspections  for  the  CFE  Treaty  placed 
OSIA  inspectors  and  escorts  opposite  their  NATO  counterparts. 
This  was  realistic  training — teams  traveled,  lost  sleep,  missed 
meals,  inspected  unfamiliar  military  facilities,  discussed  treaty 
rights  and  obligations  with  foreign  officers,  and  completed  the 
inspection  reports  as  required  by  the  treaty.  As  inspectors,  they 
aggressively  demanded  all  of  their  government’s  treaty  rights;  as 
escorts,  they  made  certain  that  their  government’s  interests  were 
fully  protected.  Colonel  Kelley  was  a  strong  proponent  of  mock 
training  inspections  because  his  INF  Treaty  experience  had  con¬ 
vinced  him  that — 

“The  mock  inspections  are  now  and  have  always  been  the 
single  most  important  training  tool  that  we  have  at  our  disposal 
for  a  number  of  reasons.  First,  they  force  you  to  put  into  practice 
the  skills  that  you  have  developed  individually  in  these  various 
areas  over  time.  Second,  the  experience  forces  a  team — or,  in  many 
cases,  multiple  teams — to  function  as  a  team.  Mocks  develop  the 
cohesiveness  that  we  wanted  to  see  and  permit  the  teams  to  further 
test  each  other  on  knowledge  of  the  treaty,  and  knowledge  of 
policy.”10 

Colonel  Kelley  turned  the  responsibility  for  the  detailed  coor¬ 
dination  and  planning  of  mock  inspections  over  to  Captain  David 
R.  Carter,  USAF.  As  Chief  of  European  Operations’  Plans  Branch, 
he  worked  directly  with  other  NATO  nations’  treaty  verification 
agencies  to  plan  each  series  of  mock  inspections.  Much  of  the 
initial  coordination  was  completed  over  the  phone,  but  final  plan¬ 
ning  was  done  in  person,  approximately  one  month  prior  to  in¬ 
spection.  Face-to-face,  the  planning  officers  from  the  nations 
ironed  out  the  details  of  the  exercise.  After  several  planning  meet¬ 
ings  Colonel  Kelley  opted  for  a  higher  ranking  team  chief,  a  lieu¬ 
tenant  colonel,  to  accompany  Carter  as  a  matter  of  protocol  for 
the  usually  senior  allied  counterparts.  For  inspections  of  U.S. 
facilities,  United  States  European  Command  (USEUCOM)  relin¬ 
quished  the  coordination  of  site  selection  to  OSIA.  Captain  Carter 
or  one  of  the  Plans  Branch  NCOs  then  dealt  directly  with  the 
component  commands  to  determine  which  U.S.  sites  would 
be  available  to  participate,  either  ground  forces  assigned  to 
USAREUR  or  air  forces  under  USAFE.  With  a  list  of  U.S.  sites 
available  for  mock  inspection,  U.S.  planners  and  their  NATO 
counterparts  developed  an  agenda  for  the  mock  inspection  includ¬ 
ing  dates,  units,  locations,  notification  procedures,  expenses,  and 
team  composition.11

The  initial  U.S.  mock  inspections  were  conducted  with 
France’s  verification  agency,  L’Unite  Frangaise  de  Verification. 

Lt.  Colonel  Gessert  led  this  mission  and  the  next  five  U.S.  mock 
inspection  missions.  Because  Lt.  Colonel  Gessert  was  new  to  the 
on-site  inspection  process,  he  relied  heavily  on  his  deputy,  Chief 
Warrant  Officer  4  (CW4)  Michael  R.  Lukes,  USA,  who  was  an 
experienced  INF  Treaty  inspector.  On  this  first  mission,  Gessert’s 
nine-person  team  drove  from  Rhein-Main  Air  Base  on  May  14, 
1991,  to  Strasbourg,  France,  the  point  of  entry  (POE)  for  this 
mission.  The  following  day  they  continued  on  to  Nancy-Ochey 
Airfield,  where  Lt.  Colonel  Gessert  declared  the  French  Air  Force’s 
3rd  Fighter  Wing  the  object  of  verification  (OOV)  for  the  first 
OSIA  CFE  mock  inspection.  Because  the  French  airfield  was  very 
large  and  there  was  much  to  be  inspected,  Lt.  Colonel  Gessert 
surprised  his  hosts  by  declining  the  prepared,  formal  luncheon. 

At  the  site,  Gessert  divided  his  team  in  two  subteams  for  the 
inspection,  with  CW4  Lukes  leading  the  second  team.  The  U.S. 
teams  set  out  on  foot  to  inspect  the  site,  overlapping  each  other’s 
efforts  to  ensure  double  coverage.  Their  approach  was  strictly 
business,  as  if  the  inspection  were  an  actual  CFE  inspection  in 
Eastern  Europe  or  the  Soviet  Union.  “We  exercised  every  aspect 
of  the  treaty,”  Gessert  recalled,  “and  made  it  very,  very  tough 
and  very,  very  difficult”  for  the  French  escorts.  After  both  U.S. 
subteams  counted  all  the  TLE  and  confirmed  their  counts  to  be 
correct,  Lt.  Colonel  Gessert  declared  a  sequential  inspection.  He 
then  signed  the  inspection  report,  completing  the  mock  inspection. 
The  following  day  the  American  team  traveled  to  Chenevieres  for 
the  sequential  inspection.  There  Gessert  declared  the  French 
Army’s  3rd  Tank  Battalion  as  the  OOV  his  team  would  inspect. 
During  this  second  inspection,  Gessert  observed  that  the  French 
military  escorts  had  become  much  more  aggressive  in  their  escort 
procedures,  trying  to  minimize  U.S.  access  and  photography,  but 
always  remaining  within  the  guidelines  of  the  treaty.  These  first 
mock  inspections  mirrored  what  would  become  the  U.S.  trade¬ 
mark  for  all  future  CFE  inspections:  an  aggressive,  “letter  of  the 
law”  approach  to  gaining  all  rights  allowed  under  the  treaty. 

These  missions  confirmed  that  a  detailed  knowledge  of  the 
treaty  was  the  key  to  a  successful  mission.  Without  a  thorough 
knowledge  of  the  treaty,  team  members  could  not  effectively  exer¬ 
cise  all  their  government’s  treaty  rights.  Lt.  Colonel  Gessert  also 
recognized  the  importance  of  teamwork  and  planning.  Because  an 
inspection  team  had  limited  time  on-site,  the  team  needed  to  de¬ 
velop  a  plan  that  allowed  all  team  members  to  carry  out  their 
specific  tasks,  while  allowing  for  a  thorough  inspection  of  the 
declared  site,  inspecting  all  areas  and  equipment  twice.  Each  indi¬ 
vidual  had  to  understand  his  role  as  an  inspector  so  that  the  team 
could  complete  an  inspection  effectively.  With  a  strong  base  of 


109 


Standing  Up  the  Unit 


preparation  and  training,  the  team  leader  could  make  adjustments 
on-site  as  circumstances  dictated.12 

At  Rhein-Main,  OSIA  inspection  teams  continued  to  hone 
their  skills  in  areas  such  as  treaty  knowledge,  equipment  identifica¬ 
tion,  language,  and  photography.  The  allied  mock  inspections 
allowed  teams  to  test  those  skills,  to  encounter  different  ap¬ 
proaches  to  the  same  treaty,  and  to  establish  inspection  standards. 
Over  time  nearly  all  the  Eastern  countries,  as  well  as  the  allies, 
pressed  U.S.  representatives  to  commit  to  scheduling  mock  inspec¬ 
tions.  Colonel  Kelley  believed  that  the  United  States  had  an  obliga¬ 
tion  to  give  preference  to  the  NATO  nations  to  conduct  mock 
inspections  because  they  “had  stuck  with  us  in  hard  times  and 
been  true  allies  to  us.”  In  addition  to  loyalty  to  allies,  it  was  also 
in  the  U.S.  interest  that  all  NATO  inspections  of  Eastern  nations 
be  thorough  and  consistent  to  provide  reliable  and  accurate  infor¬ 
mation  for  a  confident  assessment  of  treaty  compliance. 

From  May  1991  until  the  treaty  entered  into  force  in  July 
1992,  OSIA  inspectors  participated  in  mock  CFE  inspections  with 
inspection  teams  from  13  NATO  nations.  All  allied  nations  except 
Turkey  and  Italy  participated  in  27  OSIA  missions,  during  which 
U.S.  inspection  teams  conducted  mock  inspections  at  more  than  50 
sites.  In  addition  to  mock  inspections  with  NATO  teams,  OSIA 
inspectors  deployed  on  11  missions  to  U.S.  declared  sites  through¬ 
out  Western  Europe  to  conduct  mock  inspections  with  other  OSIA 
teams.  These  OSIA-on-OSIA  mock  inspections  provided  training 
not  only  for  the  U.S.  teams  but  also  for  the  American  military 
units  that  would  receive  Eastern  inspection  teams  when  the  treaty 
entered  into  force.  On  several  occasions,  OSIA  teams  provided 
classroom  training  followed  by  demonstration  mock  inspections 
at  U.S.  declared  sites.  These  missions,  known  as  “road  shows,”

allowed  OSIA  inspectors  to  reach  various  groups  of  people  who 
would  be  responsible  for  treaty  implementation,  usually  as  instal¬ 
lation  escorts  during  inspections. 

One  such  mission  began  on  October  28,  1991,  when  Lt. 
Colonel  Jan  S.  Karcz,  USA,  led  a  team  to  Sembach  Air  Base,  Ger¬ 
many.  During  this  mission  OSIA  inspectors  trained  CFE  points  of 
contact  (POCs)  from  USAFE  units  on  treaty  escort  and  challenge 
inspection  procedures.  Participants  from  the  16th  Air  Force  bases 
in  Greece,  Italy,  Crete,  and  Turkey  gathered,  along  with  Colonel 
Schuyler  (Sky)  Foerster,  USAF,  a  member  of  the  U.S.  delegation  at 
Vienna,  representatives  from  the  17th  Air  Force,  USAFE,  the  Joint 
Chiefs  of  Staff,  European  Command  (EUCOM),  and  Team  Karcz 
at  Sembach  Air  Base,  Headquarters  of  the  17th  Air  Force.  On 
October  28th,  Colonel  Foerster  provided  classroom  treaty  train¬ 
ing,  emphasizing  the  inspection  protocol.  Representatives  from 
JCS,  EUCOM,  and  USAFE  then  offered  their  organizations’  cur¬ 
rent  guidance  on  treaty  escort  and  challenge  inspection  proce¬ 
dures.  The  final  blocks  of  the  course  provided  instruction  on 
working  with  linguists  and  with  the  U.S.  government’s  liaison 
procedures.  The  next  day  Lt.  Colonel  Karcz  demonstrated  on-site 
the  lessons  taught  in  the  classroom,  leading  his  inspection  team 
through  the  mock  inspection  at  Sembach  Air  Base. 


1st  U.S./Eastern  Mock 
Inspections 

October  7-9,  1991 


Participation  in  mock  inspections  enabled  OSIA  CFE  team 
members  to  gel  as  competent,  professional  inspection  teams.  Indi¬ 
viduals  traveled  as  a  team  to  new  and  unfamiliar  locations,  carried 
out  specific  tasks  as  part  of  an  overall  team  effort  to  exercise  all 
treaty  rights,  and  gained  valuable  experience  on  how  best  to 
implement  the  CFE  Treaty.  The  next  step  in  preparation  for  the 
treaty’s  entry  into  force  was  mock  inspections  with  teams  from  the 
Eastern  group  of  states.13 


Eastern  Mock  Inspections 

The  United  States  participated  in  mock  inspections  with 
Czechoslovakia,  Russia,  Hungary,  Poland,  Romania,  and  Bulgaria 
before  the  treaty  entered  into  force  in  July  1992.  A  major  reason 
for  the  success  of  those  missions  was  Germany’s  participation  as 
the  host  state.  As  a  stationing  state,  the  United  States  needed  the 
cooperation  and  permission  of  the  German  government  to  bring 
in  Eastern  inspection  teams.  Germany  was  to  be  a  major  player 
during  treaty  implementation  because  there  were  more  than  900 
declared  sites  in  the  newly  unified  Germany,  including  the  sites  of 
stationing  states  such  as  the  United  States,  France,  Canada,  and 
the  United  Kingdom.  These  mock  inspections  offered  Germany’s 
Zentrum  fur  Verifikationsaufgaben  der  Bundeswehr  (ZVBW)  an 
opportunity  to  test  many  aspects  of  implementing  the  treaty  as  a 
host  state — these  included  procedures  at  the  POE,  transportation

to  the  declared  site,  and  providing  lodging  and 
food  when  required. 

The  first  of  these  inspections  occurred  on 
October  8,  1991,  when  a  Czechoslovakian  in¬ 
spection  team  came  to  Germany  to  inspect  U.S. 
forces  at  Camp  Vilseck  and  the  Merrill  Barracks. 

Major  Elmer  G.  (Guy)  White,  USA,  the  escort 
team  chief,  noted  that  the  drawdown  of  U.S. 
forces,  coupled  with  the  deployments  to  the  Gulf 
War,  had  dramatically  changed  U.S.  forces  in 
Europe.  Consequently,  the  information  ex¬ 
changed  at  treaty  signature  was  no  longer  accu¬ 
rate.  Because  there  would  be  no  exchange  of  data 
until  30  days  after  the  treaty’s  entry  into  force, 

OSIA  escorts  would  be  busy  explaining  differ¬ 
ences  between  the  old  data  and  the  status  of 
forces  during  the  initial  days  of  baseline. 

Major  White  also  highlighted  a  communications  problem 
between  his  team  and  Headquarters  EUCOM.  This  problem 
would  recur  later  during  other  mock  inspections,  and  it  came  up 
during  the  treaty’s  baseline  phase.  One  of  the  duties  of  U.S.  escort 
team  chiefs  and  liaison  officers  was  to  communicate  the  inspection 
team’s  status  to  EUCOM,  which  in  turn  initiated  a  series  of  notifi¬ 
cations  to  U.S.  forces  in  Europe.  Because  of  limited  phone  lines  or 
poor  connections  through  various  phone  systems,  and  the  com¬ 
pressed  time  during  an  inspection,  OSIA  team  chiefs  and  liaison 
officers  were  sometimes  unable  to  contact  EUCOM.  Instead,  they 
passed  the  information  on  to  OSIA’s  European  operations  center  at 
Rhein-Main.  From  the  operations  center,  team  status  was  passed 
to  Headquarters  EUCOM.  It  worked,  but  it  was  not  the  way  that 
it  had  been  envisioned.  Communications  in  the  future  would  rou¬ 
tinely  go  through  OSIA’s  operations  center  and  then  on  to 
EUCOM. 

The  next  mock  inspections  with  an  Eastern  nation,  and  the 
first  opportunity  to  train  outside  a  NATO  nation,  were  to  occur  in 
January  and  February  of  1992,  following  preliminary  discussions 
in  December  1991. 14  As  Christmas  1991  approached,  Colonel 
Kelley  and  Major  Henry  J.  Nowak,  USA,  traveled  from  Frankfurt 
to  Moscow,  accompanied  by  Lt.  Colonel  Peer  Schwan  of  the 
ZVBW,  the  German  treaty  verification  organization,  to  arrange  tri¬ 
national  mock  inspections  at  CFE  facilities  in  both  the  Soviet 
Union  and  Germany.  Again,  Germany’s  cooperation  was  pivotal. 
As  a  stationing  state,  the  United  States  owned  none  of  the  territory 
in  the  ATTU;  consequently,  it  turned  to  the  sovereign  host  state 
before  arranging  a  visit  by  Soviet  inspection  teams.  Major  Griffith 
S.  Hughes,  USA,  of  the  Arms  Control  Implementation  Unit  of  the 
American  Embassy  in  Moscow,  accompanied  Colonel  Kelley, 


112 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


Major  Nowak,  and  Lt.  Colonel  Schwan  in  Moscow.  On  December 
18,  1991,  these  four  officers  met  a  Soviet  delegation  of  10  officers 
led  by  General-Lieutenant  Vladimir  I.  Medvedev,  head  of  the 
Soviet  Nuclear  Risk  Reduction  Center.  Jointly,  they  planned  two 
mock  inspection  missions. 

The  first  mission  was  scheduled  for  January  1992  in  Ger¬ 
many.  The  inspection  sites  were  the  German  Artillery  Branch 
School  at  Idar-Oberstein,  the  U.S.  Air  Force’s  52d  Tactical  Fighter 
Wing  at  Spangdahlem  Air  Base,  and  the  U.S.  Army’s  200th  The¬ 
ater  Army  Materiel  Command  (TAMC)  at  the  Germersheim  Army 
Depot.  The  second  mission,  planned  for  February  1992,  would  be 
held  in  the  Leningrad  Military  District.  There,  the  designated  sites 
were  the  Soviets’  67th  Bomber  Regiment  at  Siverskiy  Air  Base  and 
the  457th  Howitzer  Artillery  Regiment  at  Pushkin.

Medvedev,  Director,  Soviet  Nuclear 
Risk  Reduction  Center. 


The  parties  then  turned  to  discussing  the  ground  rules  for 
these  mock  inspections.  These  included  planning  administrative 
breaks  to  allow  for  discussion  of  possible  technical  difficulties  as 
they  occurred.  This  provision  contributed  to  a  major  aspect  of 
these  training  missions — allowing  key  treaty  participants  time  to 
iron  out  problems  before  the  real  inspections  took  place.  The 
parties  also  modified  treaty  inspection  timelines  to  allow  for  over¬ 
night  stays.  Another  deviation  from  treaty  requirements  was  desig¬ 
nating  Frankfurt  as  the  single  POE  for  the  Soviet  mission  into 
Germany.  Normally  Frankfurt  could  not  be  a  POE  for  the  three 
declared  sites  selected  for  the  inspections.  The  officers  determined 
that  the  Soviets  would  fly  into  Rhein-Main  Air  Base  and  be  bussed 
across  the  shared  runway  to  Frankfurt  International  Airport. 

There  German  escorts  would  exercise  host  state  POE  procedures; 
Americans  would  test  their  liaison  officer  procedures;  and  the 
Soviets  would  perhaps  avoid  airport  fees  by  landing  at  Rhein- 
Main.  The  conferees  also  discussed  notification  procedures,  the 
number  of  inspectors/observers,  team  composition,  inspection 
languages,  dining  schedules,  equipment  markings,  and  distribution 
of  expenses. 

These  detailed  planning  discussions  in  Moscow,  as  had  been 
the  case  with  all  planning  sessions,  prevented  problems  that  would 
have  detracted  from  the  quality  of  training  during  the  mock  in¬ 
spections.  For  example,  Colonel  Kelley  reminded  the  Soviets  that 
U.S.  inspectors  occasionally  skipped  lunch  when  conducting  in¬ 
spections,  and  that  escorts  were  obliged  to  assist  inspectors  in 
carrying  out  an  inspection,  even  if  that  meant  a  missed  meal. 

Other  discussions  confirmed  the  U.S.  intent  to  record  all  external 
markings  of  TLE.  The  Soviets  stated  that  there  would  be  no  access 
to  the  interior  of  any  equipment  for  the  purpose  of  recording  serial 
numbers.  The  planning  agendas  for  both  inspection  series  were 
reviewed,  and  both  sides  agreed  to  hold  postinspection  discussions 
(“hotwashes”)  at  each  site  to  clarify  points  they  had  discussed

during  each  inspection.  The  group  also  agreed  to  discuss  any  prob¬ 
lems  encountered  during  the  two  missions  and  to  pursue  how  each 
nation  planned  to  conduct  its  inspections. 


During  this  conference  several  issues  arose  that  were  beyond 
the  authority  of  the  conferees  and  required  resolution  by  their 
respective  governments.  A  change  of  inspection  dates  for  the  mock 
inspections  in  the  Leningrad  Military  District  required  U.S.  gov¬ 
ernment  approval.  Lt.  Colonel  Schwan,  the  ZVBW  representative, 
turned  to  the  German  government  for  approval  of  a  Soviet  request 
to  allow  a  Soviet  military  aircraft  to  use  Sperenberg  Air  Base  in 
transit,  either  before  or  after  dropping  off  the  Soviet  inspection 
team  in  Frankfurt.  Sperenberg  Air  Base  would  provide  the  Soviets 
an  opportunity  to  refuel  their  aircraft  without  purchasing  fuel  in 
Frankfurt,  which  had  been  a  common  practice  during  the  INF 
Treaty  implementation.  Once  those  decisions  were  made,  and 
despite  the  fact  that  the  Soviet  Union  had  collapsed  as  a  nation  on 
Christmas  Day  1991,  only  seven  days  after  this  meeting,  planning 
for  the  tri-nation  mock  inspections  moved  forward." 

For  OSIA,  these  mock  inspections  in  Russia  differed  from  all 
previous  CFE  mock  inspections.  Colonel  Kelley  elected  to  forgo 
the  usual  team  structure.  Instead,  he  formed  teams  using  only  team 
chiefs  and  deputies,  with  the  one  exception  of  Technical  Sergeant 
Joseph  A.  Amen,  USAF.  Fie  did  this  because  many  of  the  American 
team  leaders  had  never  been  in  the  Soviet  Union.  As  Kelley  put  it: 


“I  wanted  very  badly  to 

avoid  a  situation...” 

— Col.  Lawrence  G.  Kelley,  USMC 
Chief  of  Operations,  OSIA  European 
Operations  Command 


“I  wanted  very  badly  to  avoid  a  situation  in  which  our  team 
leaders  would  be  rendered  ineffective  for  the  first  several  hours,  if 
not  a  day,  after  their  entry  into  the  former  Soviet  Union  for  the 
first  time,  by  virtue  of  awe.  They  had  to  get  over  that  awe.  The 
best  way  to  do  it  was  to  do  so  at  some  time  other  than  when  they 
were  performing  a  real  inspection.”

Colonel  Kelley  wanted  to  be  certain  that  team  leaders  realized 
that  military  superpower  status  did  not  equate  with  a  strong 
economy;  that  they  held  no  misconceptions  as  to  whom  and  what 
they  would  be  dealing  with  in  the  Soviet  Union.  If  team  leaders 
were  going  to  be  distracted  by  their  surroundings,  Colonel  Kelley 
wanted  it  to  happen  in  a  benign  environment,  during  a  mock 
inspection.  When  the  CFE  Treaty  entered  into  force,  he  wanted  the 
team  leaders  to  be  focused  on  the  actual  inspection.  Kelley  thought 
that  this  would  probably  be  the  only  opportunity  for  team  chiefs 
and  deputies  to  enter  the  Soviet  Union  before  baseline  started — it 
was  a  one-shot  deal.  The  team  chiefs  and  deputies  would  then 
share  their  experiences  with  their  teams  in  preparing  them  for 
baseline  inspections.16 

A  total  of  13  American  team  chiefs  or  deputies  got  firsthand 
exposure  to  Russian  CFE  inspection/escort  techniques  during  these 
mock  inspections.  Major  General  Robert  W.  Parker,  USAF,  Direc¬ 
tor  of  OSIA,  was  an  observer  on  both  missions.  Five  OSIA  team 
chiefs  and  three  deputies  were  on  the  escort  team  in  Germany, 
January  27-31,  1992,  when  the  Russians  visited  Spangdahlem  Air 
Base  and  Germersheim  Army  Depot.  In  addition  to  augmentees 
and  observers,  five  U.S.  team  chiefs  and  two  deputies  were  as¬ 
signed  to  the  American  team  that  inspected  Russian  forces  at 
Siverskiy  Air  Base  and  at  Pushkin,  February  10-14,  1992.  These 
nation-to-nation  mock  inspections  revealed  differences  in  treaty 
interpretation  that  simply  would  not  have  been  uncovered  except 
for  these  exercises. 

Captain  David  R.  Carter,  USAF,  of  the  Plans  Branch  at  OSIA 
European  Operations,  coordinated  the  effort  among  USAFE, 
USAREUR,  the  German  ZVBW,  and  OSIA  to  bring  about  the 
Russian/German/U.S.  mock  inspections.  The  official  U.S.  escort 
team  chief  was  Lt.  Colonel  Donald  C.  Snedeker,  USA,  and  his 
deputy  was  Lt.  Colonel  Edward  G.  Gallagher,  II,  USA.  The  liaison 
officers  for  this  mission  were  Majors  Richard  J.  O’Shea,  USAF, 
and  Keith  A.  Oatman,  USA.  Major  Oatman  was  an  excellent 
resource  for  facilitating  these  inspections  because  he  spoke  Ger¬ 
man  and  Russian,  a  benefit  derived  from  the  emphasis  placed  on 
language  skills  when  manning  the  unit.  Technical  Sergeant  Joseph 
A.  Amen,  USAF,  the  only  enlisted  member  of  the  team,  was  the 
logistics  coordinator,  a  position  usually  referred  to  as  the 
“bagman.”  Technical  Sergeant  Amen’s  role  was  to  make  certain 
that  inspectors  and  escorts  were  billeted  and  fed  when  it  was  the 
U.S.  government’s  responsibility  to  do  so.  Before  departing  on  the 
mission,  he  withdrew  funds  from  the  435th  Tactical  Airlift  Wing 
accounting  and  finance  center  to  cover  anticipated  expenses.  He 
arrived  with  the  escort  team  at  the  declared  site  ahead  of  the  in¬ 
spectors.  There,  he  made  arrangements  and  paid  for  billeting  or 
hotel  rooms  if  the  teams  were  spending  the  night.  He  also  paid  for 
all  meals.17

At  the  first  Russian/American/German  CFE  mock  inspection, 
January  27-31,  General  Parker  greeted  the  incoming  inspectors 
and  briefly  spoke  of  the  importance  of  this  series  of  inspections. 
He  welcomed  the  opportunity  for  joint  training,  continued  coop¬ 
eration,  mutual  trust,  and  most  important — developing  a  “key 
blueprint  for  the  CFE  verification  regime.” 


On  January  27,  1992,  little  more  than  a  month  after  the  Soviet 
Union  had  collapsed,  a  Russian  inspection  team  arrived  in  Frankfurt 
to  conduct  mock  inspections,  thus  maintaining  continuity  in  arms 
control  treaty  implementation.  The  Russian  inspection  team  and  six 
Russian  observers  underwent  POE  procedures  with  the  host  Ger¬ 
man  escort  team.  The  U.S.  liaison  team,  General  Parker,  and  Colo¬ 
nel  Kelley  were  also  there.  The  Russians  declared  their  first  inspec¬ 
tion  site,  Idar-Oberstein,  and  departed  with  the  German  host  state 
escorts.  After  an  overnight  administrative  hold,  the  Russian  inspec¬ 
tors  arrived  at  Idar-Oberstein  at  0830  for  the  mock  inspection. 
Following  the  inspection,  the  two  teams  held  an  informal  discus¬ 
sion,  reviewing  the  procedures  and  inspection  issues.  Then,  the 
Russian  team  chief  followed  treaty  protocol  procedures  and  de¬ 
clared  a  sequential  inspection  at  Spangdahlem  Air  Base.  Finally, 
again  following  treaty  protocols  precisely,  the  two  team  chiefs 
signed  the  inspection  report.  While  the  Russian  inspectors  and 
observers,  the  U.S.  liaison  team,  and  General  Parker  and  Colonel 
Kelley  spent  the  night  at  Idar-Oberstein,  the  U.S.  escort  team  trav¬ 
eled  ahead  to  Spangdahlem  Air  Base.  There  they  made  final,  last- 
minute  preparations  for  the  next  day’s  inspection.

Upon  leaving  Idar-Oberstein,  the  German  escort  team  contin¬ 
ued  their  responsibilities  for  the  Russian  inspection  team  and 
transported  them  to  the  next  inspection  site.  The  U.S.  escort 
team  greeted  the  Russian  and  German  teams  upon  arrival  at 
Spangdahlem  Air  Base  and  once  again  assumed  escort  responsibili¬ 
ties  from  the  Germans.  After  providing  refreshments  and  the  site 
diagram  to  the  Russians  at  the  Officers’  Club,  Lt.  Colonel  Snedeker 
and  his  team  waited  30  minutes  for  the  Russians  to  declare  the 
OOV  to  be  inspected.  The  Russian  team  chief  declared  the  52nd 
Tactical  Fighter  Wing,  and  the  Americans  began  the  site  briefing. 

Following  this  briefing,  the  entire  Russian  inspection  team 
participated  in  a  bus  ride  around  the  base.  Colloquially  known 
as  a  “windshield  tour,”  this  bus  ride  gave  the  inspection  team  a 
chance  to  compare  the  site  diagram  with  the  actual  facilities,  a 
practice  that  many  nations  would  later  adopt  in  escorting  inspec¬ 
tion  teams.  After  the  windshield  tour  the  Russian  team  broke  into 
three  subgroups,  which  departed  immediately  for  different  areas 
on  the  base  to  begin  their  inspections.  The  Russian  inspectors 
requested  access  to  all  doors  that  exceeded  the  treaty’s  two-meter 
limit  and  were  satisfied  with  visual  access  if  they  could  readily 
determine  there  was  no  TLE  present  in  a  building.  If  the  inspectors

could  not  immediately  determine  that  there  was  no  TLE  in  a  facil¬ 
ity,  the  American  escorts  provided  them  access  as  far  into  a  facility 
as  necessary  to  confirm  there  was  no  TLE  there,  or  until  they 
encountered  doors  that  did  not  exceed  two  meters. 

When  one  subgroup  requested  access  to  the  Munitions  Stor¬ 
age  Area,  Lt.  Colonel  Snedeker  responded  that  the  area  was  a  sensi¬ 
tive  point  with  limited  access.  He  offered  the  inspectors  an  option 
to  select  four  of  the  bunkers  within  the  storage  area  for  visual 
access  only.  The  inspectors  however,  wanted  either  total  access  or 
no  access  to  the  area.  Lt.  Colonel  Snedeker  referred  to  the  treaty 
definition  of  a  sensitive  point  as  allowing  total,  limited,  or  no 
access.  At  that  point  the  Russian  inspectors  declined  the  American 
offer  for  limited  access  and  proceeded  to  inspect  other  areas.  By 
evening,  the  Russian  team  had  finished  its  inspection,  conducted  a 
briefing,  declared  the  sequential  inspection  (the  200th  TAMC  at 
Germersheim  Army  Depot),  and  completed  the  inspection  report. 
After  a  dinner  at  the  NCO  Club,  all  teams  left  for  Germersheim, 
where  they  remained  overnight.  The  next  day  the  Russians  con¬ 
ducted  their  inspection,  participated  in  a  briefing,  completed  their 
report,  and  departed  promptly  for  Rhein-Main,  where  they  re¬ 
mained  overnight  before  returning  to  Moscow  the  next  day.18 

Several  issues  arose  during  the  inspections  of  the  two  U.S. 
sites.  Photography  was  a  point  of  contention  on  several  occasions, 
specifically,  the  framing  of  photos.  The  U.S.  escorts  insisted  that 
inspectors  photograph  an  entire  object,  not  just  a  part  of  it.  U.S. 
escorts  stated  that  an  inspection  team’s  photos  were  a  tool  in 
counting  equipment,  not  a  means  to  focus  on  an  aspect  of  a  spe¬ 
cific  piece  of  equipment  or  the  area  around  it.  Subsequently,  in 
February  1992,  during  the  U.S.  mock  inspection  at  Siverskiy  Air 


117 


Standing  Up  the  Unit 


Base,  Russian  escorts  reciprocated  by  changing  the  framing  of  U.S. 
photos  of  Russian  aircraft.  Announcing  when  inspectors  were 
going  to  take  a  picture  also  became  an  issue  when  the  Russians 
declared  that,  under  the  treaty,  they  were  required  to  announce 
their  intention  to  take  photos  only  once.  In  December  1991  at 
Vienna,  however,  General  Medvedev  had  stated  that  an  announce¬ 
ment  should  be  made  prior  to  each  photo.  Later,  Russian  escort 
officials  concurred  with  that  position  during  a  U.S.  mock  inspec¬ 
tion  at  Pushkin. 

Because  the  treaty  does  not  define  a  container,  differences  of 
interpretation  arose  during  the  mock  inspections  at  U.S.  facilities. 
The  inspection  protocol  allows  for  the  inspection  of  any  container 
that  exceeds  two  meters  in  all  dimensions.  The  Russian  inspectors 
defined  a  container  as  anything  that  “contains,”  to  include  the 
trailer  of  a  tractor  trailer  rig  or  a  communications  vehicle.  The  U.S. 
position  was  that  the  back  of  a  truck  was  a  piece  of  equipment,  and 
if  the  vehicle  was  not  a  piece  of  conventional  armaments  and  equip¬ 
ment  subject  to  the  treaty  (CAEST),  inspectors  had  no  right  to 
inspect  the  vehicle.  Later,  in  April  1992,  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  guid¬ 
ance  on  containers  allowed  inspectors  to  view  the  interior  of  cargo 
vehicles  or  tractor  trailers.  Other  vehicles  that  had  been  modified 
for  other  uses,  such  as  communications  vehicles,  called  for  different 
procedures.  If  the  modification  to  the  vehicle  were  not  readily  ap¬ 
parent,  an  effort  would  be  made  to  show  that  it  was  a  modified 
piece  of  equipment  and  did  not  contain  TLE.14 

Another  question  was  sparked  by  the  presence  of  two  Egyp¬ 
tian  F-4  fighters  at  Spangdahlem.  The  Russian  inspectors  felt  the 
fighters  should  have  been  declared  as  CAEST;  the  U.S.  response

was  that  since  Egypt  was  not  a  signatory  to  the  treaty,  the  Egyp¬ 
tian  fighters  were  not  subject  to  the  treaty,  and  the  United  States 
would  not  report  it  during  a  site  briefing  or  through  formal  CFE 
reporting  channels. 

Shortly  after  these  Russian  mock  inspections  in  Germany 
were  complete,  a  nine-man  American  inspection  team  led  by  Lt. 
Colonel  Gallagher  conducted  the  mock  inspections  in  Russia.  The 
inspection  team  and  six  observers  departed  Rhein-Main  on  an  Air 
Force  C-141  on  February  10,  1992.  They  arrived  in  Moscow 
around  noon  and,  after  a  brief  greeting,  the  Russians  immediately 
initiated  POE  procedures.  After  Gallagher  declared  Siverskiy  Air 
Base  to  be  the  first  inspection  site,  the  teams  agreed  to  stop  the 
inspection  clock.  The  team — along  with  General  Parker,  Colonel 
Kelley,  and  other  observers — remained  overnight  in  Moscow.  The 
following  morning  all  departed  for  Siverskiy  Air  Base,  where  they 
conducted  the  first  inspection.  The  American  team  departed  for 
Pushkin  the  next  day,  where  it  conducted  its  inspection  of  the 
Russian  Army  artillery  site  over  the  next  two  days.  After  complet¬ 
ing  the  second  inspection  on  the  13th,  Ft.  Colonel  Gallagher’s 
team  spent  the  night  in  Pushkin,  returning  to  Moscow  the  next 
morning  and  then  to  Rhein-Main  to  complete  the  mission. 

Photography  again  proved  to  be  a  source  of  questions  during 
these  inspections.  One  situation  dealt  with  the  number  of  photo¬ 
graphs  inspectors  were  allowed  to  take  of  CAEST.  Escort  officials 
questioned  the  need  to  take  more  than  one  photo  of  any  piece  of 
CAEST.  Lt.  Colonel  Gallagher  countered  that  photos  were  allowed 


119 


Standing  Up  the  Unit 


to  account  for  CAEST.  He  added  that  there  was  no  way  of  deter¬ 
mining  how  many  subteams  had  photographed  a  piece  of  equip¬ 
ment  and  that  treaty-authorized  use  of  video  cameras  made  the 
question  moot.  This  issue  was  resolved  when  the  Russian  escorts 
reluctantly  agreed  that  there  was  no  limit.  Reciprocity,  which  was 
an  element  of  operations  under  INF  inspections,  also  came  into 
play  during  these  CFE  mock  inspections  when  the  Russians  re¬ 
quired  U.S.  inspectors  to  frame  photos  of  SU-24s,  just  as  U.S. 
escorts  had  required  Russian  inspectors  to  frame  F-16  photos  in 
January. 

In  addition  to  photo  questions,  a  site  diagram  issue  arose 
during  the  inspection  at  Pushkin.  Russian  escorts  presented  to  the 
American  inspectors  a  site  diagram  that  did  not  indicate  common 
areas,  only  the  areas  specific  to  the  two  OOVs  at  Pushkin.  The 
American  team  chief,  Ft.  Colonel  Gallagher,  asserted  that  the 
diagram  was  not  complete  because  it  did  not  show  the  extent  of  its 
manmade  external  boundary.  This  limited  the  inspection  team’s 
access  on  the  site.  The  Russian  escorts  did  not  agree  with  his  inter¬ 
pretation  of  the  treaty  and  did  not  alter  the  boundary  of  the  site 
on  the  diagram.  Ft.  Colonel  Gallagher  noted  the  problem  on  the 
inspection  report.  It  was  a  problem  that  would  resurface  during 
the  baseline  period  and  become  the  focus  of  a  concerted  allied 
effort  to  change  the  Russian  interpretation.20 

The  February  1992  mission  to  Russia  was  the  first  CFE  mock 
inspection  deployment  into  the  Eastern  group  of  states.  Following 
that  mission,  from  March  15  through  May  9,  OSIA  teams  con-

On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


ducted  mock  inspections  in  Romania,  Czechoslovakia,  Hungary, 
and  Poland  before  the  treaty  entered  into  force  in  July  1992.  The 
final  OSIA  mock  inspection  with  an  Eastern  nation  before  the 
treaty’s  entry  into  force  occurred  on  May  11,  1992,  when  Bulgar¬ 
ian  inspectors  deployed  to  Belgium.  Each  of  these  missions  uncov¬ 
ered  problems  that  were  corrected  on  the  spot,  or  noted  and 
passed  on  for  resolution  by  the  U.S.  government.  One  problem 
that  inspectors  could  not  correct  was  the  presence  of  look-alike 
equipment  in  Czechoslovakia  that  was  not  included  in  the  proto¬ 
col  on  existing  types  of  conventional  armaments  and  equipment. 

Site  diagrams  also  proved  to  be  a  problem  at  several  loca¬ 
tions.  In  Czechoslovakia,  an  escort  team  gave  a  thorough  site 
briefing  using  wall  charts;  however,  the  site  diagrams  provided  to 
the  inspection  team  were  not  as  accurate.  The  Czech  escorts  be¬ 
lieved  that  the  treaty  requirement  to  provide  a  site  diagram  was 
satisfied  by  the  wall  charts  and  that  giving  diagrams  to  the  inspec¬ 
tors  exceeded  treaty  requirements.  The  Czechs  later  changed  their 
view  on  this  issue.  In  Romania,  escorts  presented  a  site  diagram 
that  included  the  entire  town  adjacent  to  the  military  installation. 
The  American  inspection  team  discussed  treaty  requirements  for 
site  diagrams  with  their  hosts,  whereupon  the  Romanians  nar¬ 
rowed  the  scope  of  their  site  diagram.  In  several  states  the  U.S. 
teams  experienced  difficulties  communicating  with  the  U.S.  Em¬ 
bassy.  National  phone  systems  were  sometimes  inadequate,  and 
often  U.S.  Embassy  personnel  were  not  yet  aware  of  notification 
requirements  mandated  by  the  treaty. 

In  all,  from  May  14,  1991,  through  July  5,  1992,  OSIA  in¬ 
spection  teams  deployed  on  44  mock  inspection  missions.  During 
these  missions,  OSIA  inspectors  participated  in  nearly  100  mock 
inspections.  American  inspectors  trained  with  inspectors  from  18 
nations  and  shared  their  knowledge  with  representatives  or  units 
from  USAREUR,  USAFE,  and  U.S.  Navy  Europe.  Typically,  a 
mission  lasted  for  several  days  and  involved  two  or  more  mock 
inspections.  Although  the  stay  at  any  one  location  was  brief,  the 
mock  inspections  provided  an  understanding  of  how  U.S.  teams 
would  conduct  an  inspection  and  how  U.S.  teams  would  work 
with  foreign  teams  inspecting  U.S.  forces.  In  addition,  these  inspec¬ 
tions  familiarized  U.S.  inspectors  with  the  environment  of  the 
Eastern  states,  which  would  prepare  them  for  contingencies  that 
might  arise  during  an  actual  inspection  mission.  These  missions 
also  tested  the  efficiency  of  the  logistics  system  used  to  prepare 
and  transport  U.S.  teams.  One  group  that  did  not  benefit  from  this 
series  of  mock  inspections,  however,  was  the  U.S.  liaison  person¬ 
nel,  who  would  not  be  ready  to  perform  until  days  before  the 
treaty  entered  into  force. 


121 


Role  of  the  Liaison  Officers 

During  treaty  negotiations,  U.S.  delegates  were  satisfied  that 
proposed  escort  provisions  would  protect  American  interests  when 
Eastern  teams  conducted  CFE  inspections  at  U.S.  installations.  It 
wasn’t  until  late  in  negotiations  that  the  United  States  recognized 
that  there  were  many  U.S.  facilities,  equipment,  and  personnel 
throughout  Western  Europe  that  were  not  subject  to  the  treaty  but 
were  nonetheless  vulnerable  to  CFE  inspections.  These  forces  were 
located  on  allied  installations  or  at  separate  locations,  not  on  U.S. 
installations.  They  were  vulnerable  during  challenge  inspections  of 
specified  areas  or  inspections  of  allied  forces.  Consequently,  the 
United  States  insisted  that  the  treaty  contain  a  provision  requiring 
a  liaison  officer’s  presence  during  any  inspection  of  a  nation’s 
forces.  OSIA’s  European  Operations  Command  was  not  manned  to 
carry  out  these  liaison  duties.  The  manning  document  allowed  for 
two  liaison  officers;  however,  their  planned  duties  did  not  include 
deployments  throughout  Western  Europe  whenever  Eastern  teams 
conducted  CFE  inspections. 

The  first  American  liaison  officer  (LNO),  Major  Richard  J. 
O’Shea,  USAF,  arrived  at  OSIA’s  European  Operations  Command 
in  February  1991.  One  of  O’Shea’s  first  tasks  was  to  develop  a  list 
of  the  locations  of  American  forces  throughout  Europe.  OSIA 
LNOs  needed  to  know  exactly  what  U.S.  interests  could  be  vulner¬ 
able  to  an  Eastern  CFE  Treaty  inspection  team.  The  list  proved 
difficult  to  start  and  impossible  to  complete.  No  single  headquar¬ 
ters  in  Europe  maintained  a  list  of  all  U.S.  forces  in  Europe.  Lists 
of  major  units — units  that  would  be  reportable  under  the  treaty  as 
well  as  non-CFE  units — were  readily  available  from  USAFE  and 
USAREUR.  Determining  the  whereabouts  of  the  many  small 
groups  of  U.S.  military  people  and  equipment,  however,  proved 
extremely  difficult.  Within  a  few  months,  Major  O’Shea  deter¬ 
mined  that  his  list  encompassed  more  than  1,200  locations 
throughout  the  NATO  treaty  area;  in  Germany  alone  there  were 
140  U.S.  OOVs  as  well  as  741  U.S.  facilities  that  were  not  on  U.S. 
declared  sites.  In  addition,  the  drawdown  of  U.S.  forces  from 
Europe  caused  movements  of  people  and  equipment,  much  of 
which  were  not  reportable  under  the  CFE  Treaty.  This  made  it 
difficult  to  maintain  a  current  list. 

Two  NCOs  assigned  to  the  Plans  Section — Technical  Sergeant 
Ronald  S.  Fox,  USAF,  and  Staff  Sergeant  Thomas  J.  Bradley, 

USAF — assisted  Major  O’Shea  by  designing  and  building  a  com¬ 
puter  database  nicknamed  “Big  Hog”  to  identify  U.S.  forces,  de¬ 
clared  sites,  and  POEs  throughout  Europe.  The  numerous  loca¬ 
tions  made  the  list  difficult  to  compile;  the  locations  of  classified 
programs  made  it  impossible  to  complete.  The  JCS  placed  respon¬ 
sibility  for  the  CFE  liaison  mission  on  OSIA;  however,  OSIA  was 
not  privy  to  ongoing  classified  programs.  Consequently,  the

“working”  list  that  Major  O’Shea  developed  provided  OSIA  liai¬ 
son  teams  the  most  reliable  and  current  information  available  in 
Europe.  It  was  clear,  however,  that  U.S.  teams  could  be  called  to 
protect  U.S.  interests,  whatever  they  might  be,  at  any  place  and  at 
any  time  within  the  NATO  states.21 

Although  the  JCS  guidance  on  the  OSIA  liaison  mission 
spelled  out  what  was  to  be  accomplished,  manpower  to  carry  out 
that  mission  was  not  addressed.  The  JCS  guidance  required  that  a 
U.S.  liaison  team  be  available  to  the  NATO  states’  escort  team 
whenever  Eastern  inspectors  arrived  at  a  POE  to  conduct  CFE 
inspections.  Each  U.S.  liaison  team  would  arrive  ahead  of  the 
inspection  team  and  remain  available  to  the  host  escort  team 
throughout  the  Eastern  team’s  mission  in  case  U.S.  interests  were 
involved.  By  October  1991,  OSIA  European  Operations  did  not 
have  sufficient  manning  to  accomplish  the  liaison  mission  during 
baseline,  and  Major  O’Shea  remained  the  lone  LNO  assigned. 
Colonel  Kelley  turned  to  Headquarters  to  press  for  a  solution.  He 
indicated  that  13  temporary  duty  two-person  teams  would  be 
required  during  the  120-day  baseline  period.  Kelley  recommended 
13  teams  based  on  the  inspection  quotas  of  the  U.S.  and  the 
NATO  allies,  travel  time  to  all  NATO  POEs  compared  to  notifica¬ 
tion  times,  and  the  assumption  that  the  Eastern  states  would  con¬ 
duct  all  inspections  available  to  them  in  Western  Europe.  He  also 
pointed  out  that  following  the  baseline  period,  OSIA  would  re¬ 
quire  four  officers  to  carry  out  the  continuing  liaison  mission; 
therefore,  three  additional  officers  should  be  assigned  perma¬ 
nently.  Colonel  Kelley  emphasized  the  importance  of  experience 
with  life  in  Europe  and  a  proficiency  in  a  European  language — 
German,  French,  Italian,  Spanish,  Turkish,  Greek,  or  Portuguese 
(in  that  order) — when  selecting  officers  for  liaison  duty.22

The  issue  of  who  would  supply  the  13  temporary  teams  was 
not  resolved  until  the  summer  of  1992.  Headquarters  and  other 
OSIA  locations  had  sufficient  personnel  to  execute  the  CFE  liaison 
mission.  However,  many  of  these  people  were  preparing  to  imple¬ 
ment  other  treaties  such  as  the  Strategic  Arms  Reduction  Treaty 
(START)  and  the  Chemical  Weapons  Convention.  When  the  issue 
of  CFE  liaison  support  arose,  Headquarters  personnel  pointed  to 
the  possibility  that  these  treaties  might  enter  into  force  simulta¬ 
neously,  requiring  a  maximum  effort  from  Headquarters  to  imple¬ 
ment  these  other  treaties.  Outside  OSIA,  an  increasingly  smaller 
USAREUR  also  balked  at  providing  teams  for  the  120-day  tempo¬ 
rary  duty.  In  February  1992,  Major  General  Robert  W.  Parker, 
USAF,  Director  of  OSIA,  decided  that  unless  START  and  CFE 
entered  into  force  simultaneously,  OSIA  would  provide  the  tempo¬ 
rary  liaison  support.  By  June  1992,  it  became  apparent  that  in  the 
following  month  the  CFE  Treaty  would  enter  into  force,  and  it 
was  equally  clear  that  START,  stranded  in  the  ratification  process, 
would  not  enter  into  force.  The  liaison  teams  would  come  from 
OSIA.23 

On  each  team,  the  temporary  liaison  team  members,  one 
officer  and  one  enlisted,  were  knowledgeable  and  experienced  in 
one  of  the  other  arms  control  treaties,  but  not  the  CFE  Treaty.  All 
would  require  training  on  the  CFE  Treaty  and  on  the  specific 
duties  and  responsibilities  of  a  U.S.  LNO.  In  addition  to  LNOs, 
two  additional  temporary  teams  for  escort  and  reduction  inspec¬ 
tions  would  receive  CFE  Treaty  training  at  the  same  time.  Major 
O’Shea  recommended  that  European  Operations  conduct  the 
training  at  Rhein-Main  so  that  students  would  be  free  of  the  dis¬ 
tractions  of  Headquarters  and  home.  At  Rhein-Main  the  future 
team  members  could  focus  on  their  upcoming  duties. 

During  the  course  Major  O’Shea  provided  more  than  a  third  of 
the  classroom  treaty  instruction  and  nearly  all  the  liaison-specific 
instruction.  Throughout  the  course  he  stressed  activities  expected  to 
occur  in  Germany.  Other  treaty  experts  taught  equipment  familiar¬ 
ization  and  demonstrated  an  escort  mission,  while  representatives  of 
the  German  and  the  British  verification  agencies  provided  their 


Headquarters  OSIA  near 
Washington,  D.C.,  was  the  primary 
source  for  liaison  officers  during 
CFE  baseline.

agencies’  perspectives  on  liaison  operations. 
Three  days  after  the  CFE  Liaison  (7-11  July)  and 
CFE  Treaty  (13-16  July)  courses,  half  the  gradu¬ 
ates  were  in  place  throughout  Europe  awaiting 
Eastern  inspection  teams,  while  the  rest  returned 
to  their  duty  sections.  Midway  through  baseline, 
at  the  end  of  60  days,  the  two  groups  would 
rotate  positions.24 

The  concentration  of  American  and  NATO 
forces  in  Central  Europe  dictated  that  the  U.S. 
liaison  mission  focus  on  Germany.  Conversely, 
the  flanks  or  outlying  areas,  such  as  Portugal, 
held  far  fewer  U.S.  or  NATO  forces,  would  be 
subject  to  fewer  Eastern  inspections,  and  there¬ 
fore  would  require  fewer  American  LNOs.  The 
primary  consideration  in  team  placement  was 
response  time.  Six  liaison  teams  in  Germany  could  operate  effec¬ 
tively  from  Rhein-Main  to  meet  inspection  teams  in  Germany, 
Belgium,  Norway,  Denmark,  the  Netherlands,  and  Greece.  Com¬ 
mercial  airline  schedules  were  not  timely  enough,  and  military 
airlift  was  too  limited  to  support  LNO  missions  that  could  be 
unpredictable  and  possibly  frequent  in  the  United  Kingdom,  Tur¬ 
key,  Spain,  or  Portugal.  To  satisfy  the  U.S  government  policy  to 
have  a  liaison  team  available  for  each  Eastern  inspection  team, 
two  teams  deployed  to  the  United  Kingdom  while  two  teams  trav¬ 
eled  to  Turkey,  and  one  team  deployed  to  Spain  to  stand  by  to 
carry  out  liaison  operations.  The  single  team  in  Madrid  was  also 
prepared  to  respond  to  an  Eastern  team  in  Portugal. 


Luxembourg,  Iceland,  and  France  were  exceptions  for  U.S. 
liaison  operations.  There  were  no  U.S.  forces  in  France,  only  six 
M47  tanks.  In  the  unlikely  event  of  an  inspection  of  those  tanks, 
the  U.S.  would  forgo  its  right  to  be  present  at  the  inspection.  Lux¬ 
embourg  and  Iceland  had  no  OOVs  of  their  own,  but  there  were 
U.S.  OOVs  and  declared  sites  located  on  their  territory.  When  an 
Eastern  state  announced  its  intent  to  inspect  in  one  of  these  na¬ 
tions,  an  entire  U.S.  escort  team  would  deploy  because  the  inspec¬ 
tion  had  to  be  on  a  U.S.  declared  site.25 


Final  Preparations 

During  the  30  days  prior  to  the  CFE  Treaty’s  entry  into  force, 
Colonel  Kelley  provided  the  inspection  teams  one  last  opportunity 
to  shore  up  any  weak  spots  in  their  readiness  to  conduct  their 
missions.  He  directed  the  support  branches  to  provide  the  inspec¬ 
tion  division  with  briefings  and  refresher  training  programs  on 
specific  topics  he  felt  would  be  critical  to  a  successful  baseline 
effort.  The  Logistics  Division  reviewed  and  refined  “bagman” 


125 


procedures,  vehicle  operations,  supply,  and  procuring  air  transpor¬ 
tation  under  several  different  scenarios.  Plans  and  Analysis  briefed 
inspection  teams  on  target  folders,  special  databases,  and  other 
areas  of  direct  assistance.  The  Plans  Branch  also  reminded  inspec¬ 
tors  of  their  responsibility  to  provide  accurate  information  needed 
to  develop  treaty  notification  messages.  The  Operations  Branch 
provided  training  on  its  capabilities  for  assisting  teams  through 
communications  and  current  information  on  different  countries. 
Other  briefings  and  training  dealt  with  team  equipment,  photogra¬ 
phy,  TLE  identification,  emergency  medical  training,  and  prepara¬ 
tion  of  CFE  Treaty  reports.26 

Transportation 

Transportation  was  critical  for  successful  implementation  of 
the  treaty.  Inspection  teams  traveled  hundreds  or  even  thousands 
of  miles  to  arrive  at  distant  points  of  entry  (POEs)  at  the  notified 
time.  Liaison  and  escort  teams  had  to  react  with  minimal  notice  to 
the  arrival  of  Eastern  inspection  teams  at  NATO  states.  The  escort 
teams  had  to  transport  up  to  10  people,  including  a  bagman. 
Escort  and  liaison  teams  needed  flexible  and  timely  transportation 
to  meet  the  limited  notifications  allowed  in  declared  site  or  chal¬ 
lenge  inspections.  Trains  and  commercial  planes  in  the  region  were 
excellent,  but  they  ran  only  on  fixed  schedules  and  didn’t  go  di¬ 
rectly  to  the  inspection  sites  or  all  POEs.  Because  automobiles 
could  satisfy  mission  requirements  for  90  percent  of  the  U.S. 
OOVs,  escort  and  liaison  teams  in  Germany  and  the  nearby 
Benelux  countries  relied  on  minivans.  Vans  allowed  teams  to  leave 
at  any  time  and  to  go  directly  to  the  inspection  site  or  POE.  Dur¬ 
ing  baseline,  each  escort  team  was  assigned  two  minivans  to  trans¬ 
port  all  team  members  and  their  gear.  The  two-person  LNO  teams 
deployed  by  station  wagon.  The  motor  pool  at  Rhein-Main  could 
not  support  OSIA  with  a  fleet  of  15  minivans  and  7  station  wag¬ 
ons,  so  OSIA  leased  them  from  two  local  companies.  Liaison 
teams  pre-positioned  outside  Germany  normally  used  rental  cars 
in  their  missions.  Motor  vehicles,  however,  could  not  satisfy  all  of 
OSIA’s  mission  requirements.2 

To  conduct  CFE  inspections  in  the  Eastern  states,  U.S.  teams 
would  deploy  to  national  entry  points  as  far  away  as  Moscow. 
American  escort  teams  would  also  respond,  on  short  notice,  to 
areas  across  Western  Europe  from  the  United  Kingdom  to  Turkey. 
Airlift  was  the  only  way  to  implement  the  treaty  in  those  circum¬ 
stances.  In  early  planning  Major  Steven  E.  Pestana,  USAF,  of  the 
Mission  Coordination  Branch,  studied  the  possibility  of  using 
C-20  class  aircraft.  These  small  business  jets  were  perhaps  the  best 
suited  for  the  mission,  although  there  was  concern  that  all  the 
inspectors  and  their  belongings  could  exceed  weight  limits  of  the 
aircraft.  With  the  Gulf  War  and  the  drawdown  of  American  forces 
in  Europe,  however,  the  C-20s  were  no  longer  an  option.  There

were  not  enough  suitable  U.S.  aircraft  in  Europe  to  support  the 
CFE  mission.  In  January  1990,  the  director  of  operations  at  Head¬ 
quarters  USAFE  announced  that  the  Military  Airlift  Command 
(MAC)  would  provide  C-141,  C-130,  or  C-5  airlift  for  the  CFE 
mission,  based  on  passenger  or  load  requirements.  In  addition, 
USAFE  would  provide  C-130  aircraft  to  support  the  CFE  mission. 
The  435th  Tactical  Airlift  Wing  at  Rhein-Main,  a  USAFE  unit,* 
and  the  437th  and  438th  Military  Airlift  Wings  from  Charleston 
AFB,  South  Carolina,  and  McGuire  AFB,  New  Jersey,  both  MAC 
wings,  would  provide  airlift  support  to  OSIA  teams. 

The  435th  crews  flew  C-130s  on  inspection  missions  into 
Eastern  Europe,  and  also  were  tasked  to  support  CFE  escort  mis¬ 
sions  outside  Central  Europe.  To  perform  that  mission,  which 
could  be  on  short  notice  for  escort  operations,  the  435th  kept  two 
crews  and  one  C-130  on  alert.  Meanwhile,  crews  of  the  437th  and 
438th  flew  C-141s  on  inspection  missions  into  the  former  Soviet 
Union.  The  MAC  wings  alternated  support  with  two  C-141s  that 
were  pre-positioned  at  Rhein-Main.  Wilbur  Lewis,  Jr.,  of  OSIA’s 
Military  Airlift  Coordination  Branch,  arranged  for  the  C-141 


‘During  the  same  time  OSIA  was  preparing  for  CFE  Treaty  implementation,  the  U.S.  Air 
Force  underwent  a  reorganization.  As  a  part  of  this  reorganization,  control  of  Rhein-Main 
Air  Base  and  its  host  unit,  the  435th  Tactical  Airlift  Wing,  passed  from  MAC  to  USAFE. 
Previously,  while  USAFE  played  a  major  role  in  scheduling  the  435th's  C-130  theater 
airlift  forces,  it  did  not  actually  own  the  unit.  The  reorganization  also  resulted  in  many 
redesignations,  both  to  field  units  and  major  commands.  On  1  June  1992,  MAC  inactivated 
and  was  replaced  by  the  Air  Mobility  Command  (AMC).  In  addition,  both  Military  Airlift 
Wings  and  Tactical  Airlift  Wings  were  redesignated  simply  as  Airlift  Wings.

support  from  OSIA  Headquarters.  The  Plans  Branch  at  European 
Operations  (EO)  coordinated  C-130  missions  at  Rhein-Main. 

One  of  the  elements  of  coordinating  airlift  support  was  track¬ 
ing  vital  information  on  all  aircrew  members.28  The  protocol  on 
inspection  required  that  each  signatory  provide  a  list  to  all  other 
treaty  nations  of  aircrew  members  (600  maximum)  and  inspectors 
(400  maximum)  designated  to  support  or  participate  in  CFE  in¬ 
spections.  The  list  included  names,  gender,  date  and  place  of  birth, 
and  passport  number.  The  long,  detailed  U.S.  list  was  compiled  by 
OSIA’s  Treaty  List  Management  Branch.  Once  the  list  was  com¬ 
piled,  OSIA  turned  it  over  to  the  U.S.  State  Department  for  dis¬ 
semination  to  other  nations  at  Vienna.  The  inspection  protocol 
required  each  state  to  provide  this  list  to  all  other  signatories 
within  90  days  after  treaty  signature.  The  next  opportunity  to 
update  lists  came  within  30  days  of  treaty  implementation.  In 
addition,  the  treaty  allowed  a  nation  receiving  the  list  up  to  30 
days  to  review  it  and  request  that  the  originating  state  delete  cer¬ 
tain  names  from  the  list;  there  was  no  right  of  refusal  to  delete 
names.  Because  of  the  long  period  between  signature  and  entry 
into  force,  the  U.S.  list  was  outdated  at  entry  into  force.  Some 
people  were  no  longer  available  for  duty  but  were  still  on  the  list, 
and  others  who  arrived  after  the  original  list  was  submitted  were 
available  for  duty  but  not  listed.  This  situation  would  affect 
OSIA’s  early  baseline  operations.29 

Communications 

Communications  under  the  INF  Treaty  had  been  relatively 
simple.  The  Nuclear  Risk  Reduction  Center  (NRRC)  at  the  U.S. 
State  Department  passed  information  directly  to  the  Soviet 
Nuclear  Risk  Reduction  Center  in  Moscow.  A  single  conduit 
passed  all  required  data.  Under  the  CFE  Treaty,  a  new  system,  the 
CSCE  (Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe)  com¬ 
munications  network,  was  only  partially  functional  when  the 
treaty’s  baseline  inspection  phase  started  in  July  1992. 

The  CSCE  members  had  anticipated  a  communications  net¬ 
work  linking  35  CSCE  capitals  and  three  CSCE  institutions  24 
hours  a  day.  The  system,  designed  to  support  the  Vienna  Docu¬ 
ment,  was  linked  by  a  central  switching  center  at  The  Hague. 
Unfortunately,  when  the  system  was  designed,  the  Soviet  Union 
required  only  one  terminal,  in  Moscow.  With  the  breakup  of  the 
USSR,  however,  a  glaring  weakness  in  the  CSCE  communications 
system  surfaced.  No  nation  in  the  former  Soviet  Union,  except 
Russia,  had  the  hardware  to  connect  to  the  system.  Hardware  was 
expensive,  and  newly  emerging  nations  opted  to  apply  their  lim¬ 
ited  resources  to  other  pressing  matters.  As  a  result,  during  CFE 
baseline  the  U.S.  NRRC  transmitted  CFE  messages  to  only  those 
nations  that  were  operating  on  the  CSCE  network. 


128 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


To  reach  those  nations  that  were  not  yet 
on  the  network,  and  as  a  backup  in  case  of  a 
system  failure,  the  State  Department  also  sent 
CFE  notification  messages  through  diplo¬ 
matic  channels.  Diplomatic  channels  some¬ 
times  entailed  hand-carried  messages  from 
the  U.S.  Embassy  to  the  appropriate  officials 
in  that  state.  Acknowledgment  of  receipt  and 
acceptance  of  an  inspection  required  addi¬ 
tional  hand-carried  notes  from  state  agencies 
to  the  U.S.  Embassy.  This  added  a  burden  to 
some  embassy  staffs  that  were  already  ex¬ 
tremely  busy  and,  as  was  discovered  during 
mock  inspections,  were  sometimes  unaware 
of  notification  requirements  of  the  CFE 
Treaty.  Meanwhile,  the  Plans  Branch  and 
Operations  at  EO  had  opened  an  informal  “back  door”  communi¬ 
cations  network  that  eclipsed  the  formal  system  during  the  early 
stages  of  baseline. 

This  informal  communications  system  was  based  on  the 
excellent  working  relationships  of  staff  with  their  counterparts  in 
verification  agencies  throughout  Europe.  This  informal  system 
developed  with  the  initial  outreach  for  mock  inspections  and  grew 
day  to  day  as  the  agencies — particularly  the  German,  French, 
British,  and  U.S.  agencies — repeatedly  looked  to  each  other  for 
reliable  and  timely  information.  This  informal  network  would 
prove  valuable  during  baseline,  when  the  formal  notification  sys¬ 
tem  occasionally  failed.  Fortunately,  the  informal  communication 
system  provided  a  safety  net,  and  frequently  OSIA  liaison  teams 
had  to  prepare  or  deploy  based  on  information  from  this  network. 

As  baseline  drew  near,  the  teams  were  trained  and  eager, 
equipment  was  in  place,  transportation  stood  ready,  and  several 
communications  systems  were  operating.30

What  was  the  status  of  the  other  CFE  Treaty  states  as  they 
prepared  to  implement  the  treaty?  On  the  first  day  of 
the  treaty’s  entry  into  force,  every  state  had  to  be  ready 
to  carry  out  its  treaty  obligations  and  rights.  Obligations  meant 
that  states  had  to  be  prepared  to  display  and  account  for  their 
treaty-limited  equipment  (TLE);  ready  to  send  and  receive  treaty- 
required  communications  regarding  force  data,  reduction  activi¬ 
ties,  and  notifications  of  all  inspections;  and  ready  to  receive  in¬ 
spection  teams,  transport  them  to  the  declared  sites,  host  and 
escort  them  on-site,  and  return  them  to  the  point  of  entry  (POE) 
after  completion  of  the  inspection.  Treaty  rights  focused  on  the 
selection,  preparation,  and  training  of  inspection  teams  that  would 
monitor  the  different  phases  of  the  treaty.  They  also  included  the 
opportunity  to  send  national  delegates  to  serve  on  the  Joint  Con¬ 
sultative  Group  (JCG),  which  was  responsible  for  facilitating  the 
treaty’s  implementation.  A  survey  of  the  29  CFE  Treaty  states  on

agency  in  the  Eastern  states. 


the  eve  of  the  treaty’s  entry  into  force  on  July  17,  1992,  revealed 
a  wide  degree  of  preparedness,  as  one  might  expect  from  a  wide 
array  of  nations — large  and  small,  stable  and  unstable,  and  spread 
over  a  continent. 

Within  NATO,  four  nations — the  United  States,  Germany, 
France,  and  Great  Britain — had  established  new  agencies  or  ex¬ 
panded  existing  on-site  inspection  organizations  in  1990-91. 

Other  NATO  nations,  such  as  Belgium,  Italy,  and  the  Netherlands, 
set  up  small  arms  control  verification  staffs  in  their  ministries  of 
defense  or  on  their  general  staffs.  Generally,  nations  with  larger 
military  forces  set  up  separate  agencies  to  implement  the  treaty, 
while  smaller  nations  opted  for  military  staff  offices  to  satisfy  CFE 
requirements. 

Within  the  Eastern  group  of  states,  the  Soviet  Union/Russia 
had  the  largest  and  most  experienced  inspection  agency.  Estab¬ 
lished  in  1987  to  implement  the  Intermediate-Range  Nuclear 
Forces  (INF)  Treaty,  the  Soviet  Union’s  inspectorate,  the  Nuclear 
Risk  Reduction  Center  (NRRC),  became  the  new  Russian  nation’s 
inspection  agency  late  in  1991.  To  implement  the  INF  Treaty,  the 
Soviet  Union’s  NRRC  had  established  treaty  support  organizations 
in  the  Soviet  military  districts.  From  1988  to  1991,  when  all  INF 
treaty  items  had  been  eliminated,  these  support  elements  gained 
invaluable  experience  working  with  inspection  regimes,  reduction 
protocols,  notification  requirements,  and  timelines.  Consequently, 
when  Belarus  and  Ukraine  set  up  their  CFE  Treaty  verification 
agencies  in  1992,  they  had  a  cadre  of  people  experienced  in  imple¬ 
menting  arms  control  treaties.  Six  months  after  the  collapse  of  the 
Soviet  Union,  eight  of  the  newly  independent  states  became  parties 
to  the  CFE  Treaty  in  June  1992  at  the  Conference  on  Security  and 
Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE)  summit  in  Oslo.  They  were  Russia, 
Belarus,  Ukraine,  Georgia,  Moldova,  Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  and 


135 


Final  Preparations:  NATO  and  WTO  Nations 


Kazakstan.  Of  these  states,  only  Russia,  Belarus,  and  Ukraine 
possessed  a  professional  cadre  of  inspectors,  escorts,  reduction 
facilities,  and  institutional  relationships  with  national  military 
forces.  The  other  states,  Georgia,  Moldova,  Armenia,  Azerbaijan, 
and  Kazakstan,  had  little  or  no  direct  treaty  experience.  Many  of 
these  new  nations  were  caught  up  in  internal  and  external  wars 
and  had  little  time  or  interest  in  any  treaty  that  would  reduce 
conventional  armaments. 

As  with  agencies  of  the  NATO  nations,  the  size  and  structure 
of  the  Eastern  European  nations’  inspectorates  varied  consider¬ 
ably.  Poland,  Hungary,  Czechoslovakia,  Bulgaria,  and  Romania 
established  CFE  Treaty  verification  agencies  either  before  treaty 
signature  in  November  1990,  or  shortly  thereafter  in  early  1991. 
In  1991,  Poland  established  a  separate  verification  agency  with  an 
authorized  force  of  85  military  officers  and  civilians,  and  placed 
the  new  organization  in  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense.  Hun¬ 
gary,  by  contrast,  set  up  a  small  arms  control  section  within  its 
national  armed  forces  in  1990. 

Characteristics  of  European  and  Russian 
CFE  Treaty  Inspection  Teams 

When  Germany  established  its  Federal  Armed  Forces  Verifi¬ 
cation  Center,  the  Zentrum  fur  Verifikationsaufgaben  der 
Bundeswehr  (ZVBW),  in  October  1990,  it  had  an  authorized  staff

of  65  inspectors,  communicators,  trainers,  logisticians,  and  admin¬ 
istrators.1  For  its  initial  cadre  of  CFE  Treaty  inspectors,  the  new 
German  center  drew  upon  a  small  group  of  military  officers  who 
had  been  conducting  inspections  of  large-scale  military  exercises  of 
the  CSCE  states  under  the  Stockholm  Document  of  1986.  A  few  of 
these  experienced  officers  became  CFE  inspection  team  leaders. 

For  the  other  CFE  team  leaders,  the  German  Bundeswehr  re¬ 
quested  volunteers.  Many  officers  applied,  and  by  December  1989, 
some  1 1  months  before  the  CFE  Treaty  was  signed,  all  the  German 
CFE  team  leaders  had  been  selected  and  enrolled  in  an  intensive 
Russian  language  course.  Colonel  Joern  Steinberg  recalls  that  he 
and  the  other  German  team  leaders  studied  for  nine  months  at  the 
national  language  school  at  Hurth,  Germany.2  All  German  team 
leaders  were  professional  military  officers,  40  to  50  years  old,  with 
15  to  25  years  of  service  in  the  German  army,  air  force,  or  navy. 

The  German  verification  center  opened  in  October  1990  at 
Geilenkirchen  and  immediately  began  the  process  of  organizing 
inspection  teams.  Each  team  trained  as  a  unit,  concentrating  on 
learning  the  treaty  as  well  as  the  current  military  force  structure 
and  the  TLE  of  a  single  signatory  state  or  group  of  states.  German 
CFE  Treaty  inspection  teams  were  led  by  colonels,  with  lieutenant 
colonels  serving  as  deputies  and  captains,  lieutenants,  and  non¬ 
commissioned  officers  (NCOs)  as  inspectors.  In  1991  and  1992, 
the  German  verification  center  grew  rapidly,  acquiring  new  mis¬ 
sions  under  the  Open  Skies  Treaty  and  the  Vienna  Documents  of 
1990  and  1992.  By  July  1992,  the  center  had  400  personnel  on 
board.  A  considerable  part  of  this  growth  reflected  the  incorpora- 


Final  Preparations:  NATO  and  WTO  Nations  137 


tion  of  the  former  German  Democratic  Republic’s  (GDR)  treaty 
verification  unit.3 


Following  German  unification  in  October  1990,  the  German 
federal  armed  forces  incorporated  the  GDR’s  army  and  air  force 
personnel  and  equipment.  Approximately  six  months  later,  in 
March  1991,  the  GDR’s  verification  agency  became  a  branch 
office  of  the  German  Federal  Armed  Forces  Verification  Center. 

It  had  140  officers,  NCOs,  and  civilians  and  was  located  at 
Strausberg,  30  kilometers  east  of  Berlin.  Many  of  the  Strausberg 
personnel  had  direct  experience  with  the  INF  Treaty.  Now,  in 
1991  and  1992,  their  mission  would  be  to  supervise  the  CFE 
Treaty  reduction  centers  located  in  eastern  Germany  and  to  escort 
inspection  teams  from  the  Eastern  group  of  states.4 


One  interesting  aspect  of  German  unification  was  the  large 
quantity  of  former  GDR  army  and  air  force  weapons  and  equip¬ 
ment  available  for  incorporation  into  the  federal  armed  forces. 
Shortly  after  unification,  the  German  minister  of  defense  decided 
that  most  of  the  former  GDR  military  equipment  was  not  suited 
for  the  federal  army  and  air  force.  Since  the  mid-1950s,  West 
Germany’s  military  forces  had  been  equipped  with  weapons  and 
munitions  that  met  NATO  standards.  Most,  if  not  all,  of  the  GDR 
army  and  air  force  equipment  had  been  designed  and  produced  for 
use  with  the  Soviet  armed  forces.  Operationally  incompatible,  it 
was  surplus  equipment  and  would  be  eliminated.  Since  many  of 
the  former  GDR’s  offensive  weapons  fell  under  the  provisions  of 
the  CFE  Treaty,  Germany  would  have  to  destroy  them  during  the 
treaty’s  reduction  period.  Before  the  CFE  Treaty  entered  into  force, 
however,  Germany’s  CFE  Treaty  inspection  teams  used  this  former 
GDR  equipment  as  an  opportunity  to  study  firsthand  Soviet  army 
TLE  and  “look-alike”  equipment.  For  the  new  German  verification 
center,  this  was  both  an  unexpected  and  important  opportunity.’ 

The  French  CFE  inspection  teams  were  led  by  professional 
military  officers,  usually  lieutenant  colonels,  38  to  45  years  old, 
with  service  on  command  headquarters  staff  or  on  the  French 
General  Staff.  In  February  1994,  Colonel  Francois  Rozec,  Com¬ 
mandant  of  L’Unite  Fran^aise  de  Verification,  explained  that  three 
areas  were  important  in  selecting  inspection  team  leaders:  profes¬ 
sional  skill,  linguistic  ability,  and  maturity.  “As  far  as  maturity  is 
concerned,”  Colonel  Rozec  said,  “We  consider  it  to  be  psychologi¬ 
cal  equilibrium,  judgment,  and  ease  of  communication.”6 

The  French  agency  was  formed  in  September  1990  to  carry 
out  French  “verification  and  hosting”  responsibilities  under  the 
CFE  Treaty  and  the  Vienna  Document  1990.  Focated  approxi¬ 
mately  70  kilometers  north  of  Paris,  on  French  Air  Station  110  at 
Creil,  France,  the  unit  was  subordinate  to  the  Arms  Control  Divi¬ 
sion  of  the  French  General  Staff  in  Paris.  For  its  personnel,  the 
new  treaty  verification  unit  drew  upon  specialists  from  the  French

army,  air  force,  and  navy.  Under  the  CFE  Treaty,  France  declared 
1,355  tanks,  1,392  artillery  pieces,  4,154  armored  combat  ve¬ 
hicles,  376  helicopters,  and  688  fighter  aircraft.  As  a  state  party, 
France  declared  168  sites  and  211  objects  of  verification.  Brigadier 
General  Jean-Paul  Huet  served  as  the  first  Commandant;  in  April 
1992,  Colonel  Rozec  assumed  command. 

From  the  beginning,  the  French  inspectorate  developed  “or¬ 
ganic  teams,”  each  with  a  dedicated  team  leader,  deputy,  linguists, 
and  inspectors.  Their  approach  to  preparing  for  an  inspection 
mission  was  similar  to  the  German  inspection  teams’ — studying  a 
specific  nation’s  TFE  holdings,  current  force  structure,  and  organi¬ 
zational  lines.  For  part  of  their  time,  each  French  inspection  team 
worked  directly  with  French  army  and  air  force  units  and  installa¬ 
tions  subject  to  CFE  Treaty  inspections,  providing  training  on  the 
treaty,  inspection  protocols,  and  reduction  procedures.8 

Great  Britain  had  experience  with  on-site  inspections  under 
the  Stockholm  Document  of  1986  and  with  the  British  Military 
Fiaison  Mission  in  Berlin  from  1947  to  1991.  Its  officers  were 
professional,  knowledgeable,  and  at  the  forefront  in  analysis  and 
evaluations.  In  August  1990,  the  British  Ministry  of  Defense  se¬ 
lected  Colonel  Roy  Giles,  RAF,  to  lead  the  Joint  Arms  Control 
Implementation  Group  (JACIG).  Focated  at  RAF  Scampton,  the 
new  four-service  group  drew  personnel  from  the  Royal  Navy, 
Marines,  Army,  and  Air  Force.  It  had  an  assigned  strength  of  120 
officers,  NCOs,  and  civilians.  From  the  beginning,  Colonel  Giles 
directed  that  the  British  group  would  use  full-time  inspection  and 
escort  teams.  Most  of  the  initial  cadre  of  inspectors  had  served  in 
Berlin  with  the  British  Military  Fiaison  Mission  or  had  worked  as 
interpreters  in  the  Berlin  Corridor.  They  were  very  knowledgeable 
on  the  Soviet  Union,  its  armed  forces,  and  its  military  equipment. 
Colonel  Giles  encouraged  volunteers,  especially  officers  and  NCOs 
with  Russian  language  skills.9 

The  Belgian  concept  of  operations  called  for  the  establish¬ 
ment  of  a  small  professional  verification  staff  attached  to  the 
Ministry  of  Defense  in  Brussels.  This  staff  would  organize,  train, 
and  lead  the  Belgian  CFE  Treaty  inspection  and  escort  teams, 
which  were  composed  of  inspectors  drawn  from  the  ranks  of  the 
military  services.  Early  in  1990  the  General  Staff  selected  two 
groups  of  five  midlevel  officers,  all  lieutenant  colonels,  and  en¬ 
rolled  them  in  an  intensive  Russian  language  course.10  According 
to  Ft.  Colonel  Fred  Janssen,  Director  of  Operations,  F’Unite  Beige 
de  Verification,  initial  language  training  for  the  team  leaders 
would  enable  them  “to  express  themselves  in  normal,  ordinary 
daily  talks”  with  their  Russian  military  escorts.11  For  treaty  issues 
and  technical  questions  that  might  arise  during  the  inspection, 
Janssen  indicated  that  each  team  would  have  some  inspectors  who 
were  qualified  interpreters.  It  is  interesting  that  the  leaders  of  the 


Final  Preparations:  NATO  and  WTO  Nations  139 


Belgian  verification  agency  envisioned,  almost  from  the  beginning, 
multinational  CFE  inspection  teams  composed  of  inspectors  from 
several  different  nations.  Inspectors  from  Luxembourg  joined  the 
Belgian  agency’s  initial  language  training  course,  as  did  officers 
from  the  Dutch  inspectorate.  For  the  three  Benelux  nations,  this 
joint  language  training  signaled  a  willingness  to  participate  in 
other  joint  activities  in  implementing  the  treaty.12 


In  the  Netherlands,  in  early  1990  the  Ministry  of  Defense  set 
up  a  small  treaty  verification  staff  called  the  Arms  Control  Branch. 
Its  mission  was  to  assume  responsibility  for  the  nation’s  CFE 
Treaty  compliance  and  to  coordinate  with  the  Dutch  military 
forces  on  all  aspects  of  treaty  implementation.  According  to  Navy 
Commander  C.N.M.  Wierema,  Director  of  the  Arms  Control 
Branch,  the  Netherlands  operated  under  a  “cadre”  concept  in 
implementing  the  CFE  Treaty,  meaning  that  the  Arms  Control 
Branch  would  be  a  small,  joint-service  staff,  with  approximately 
16  to  18  military  officers.  Their  principal  role  was  compiling  the 
Netherlands’  required  treaty  data  submissions,  developing  all 
official  treaty  notifications,  coordinating  the  scheduling  and  con¬ 
duct  of  inspections  and  reductions  with  the  military  forces,  and 
representing  the  nation  at  the  Verification  Coordinating  Commit¬ 
tee  meetings  held  at  Headquarters  NATO.  The  Dutch  army  identi¬ 
fied  80  to  85  officers  and  NCOs  to  be  trained  as  CFE  Treaty  in¬ 
spectors  and  escorts,  and  the  Dutch  air  force  dedicated  30  to  35 
officers  to  assist  in  implementing  the  treaty.  When  it  came  to  con¬ 
ducting  CFE  Treaty  inspections  in  the  Eastern  nations,  the  Arms 
Control  Branch  selected  senior  army  or  air  force  officers,  usually 
in  the  rank  of  lieutenant  colonel,  to  serve  as  team  chiefs.  The 
Dutch  required  their  inspectors  to  speak  and  understand  Russian. 
According  to  Commander  Wierema,  “It  takes  about  a  year  and  a 
half  before  the  inspectors  reach  the  required  level  in  their  language 
skills.  Russian  is  very  difficult.”13 

When  Poland  established  its  verification  agency  in  1990,  the 
Polish  government  was  in  the  midst  of  a  general  restructuring  of 
its  armed  forces.  Colonel  Stanislaw  Malinowski,  Director  of  the 
Polish  Verification  Unit,  explained  that  Poland  had  elected  to 
place  the  new  center  in  the  civilian  component  of  the  Ministry  of 
National  Defense,  outside  the  military  structure  of  the  armed 
forces.  He  added,  “It  cooperates  very  closely  with  the  military 
component.”14  After  CFE  Treaty  signature  in  November  1990, 
the  Ministry  of  National  Defense  determined  that  the  verification 
center’s  initial  staffing  was  not  sufficient  to  carry  out  Poland’s 
treaty  requirements.  In  its  November  1990  data  submission, 
Poland  stated  that  it  had  124  declared  sites  and  149  military  units, 
or  objects  of  verification  (OOVs)  with  TLE.  At  the  same  time, 
Poland’s  reduction  liability  was  approximately  1,120  tanks,  690 
artillery  pieces,  1,130  armored  personnel  vehicles,  and  91  aircraft. 
Consequently,  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense  organized  special

arms  control  sections  in  each  of  the  Polish  army’s 
military  districts  and  at  the  Polish  Armed  Forces 
Headquarters.  Colonel  Malinowski  explained, 
“The  center’s  present  activities  are,  among  other 
things,  to  supervise  activities  of  these  divisions  in 
the  military  structure.”1'’  For  CFE  inspection  and 
escort  team  leaders,  Poland  used  professional 
military  officers  who  were  experienced  and 
knowledgeable  about  armaments  and  equipment 
included  in  the  CFE  Treaty.  Competence  in  a 
foreign  language  was  an  important  criterion  for 
selection.  Colonel  Malinowski  said  that  from 
their  initial  planning,  they  had  anticipated  host¬ 
ing  many  national  inspection  teams  at  Polish 
reduction  facilities  and  declared  sites.16 

The  largest  CFE  Treaty  state,  Russia,  had  significant  advan¬ 
tages  in  recruiting,  selecting,  and  training  its  CFE  inspection  teams 
because  of  its  experience  in  implementing  the  INF  Treaty.  The 
Soviet  Union’s  inspection  agency,  the  Nuclear  Risk  Reduction 
Center  (NRRC),  was  located  in  Moscow.  When  Russia  emerged  as 
a  successor  state,  the  NRRC  retained  all  the  agency’s  missions, 
functions,  and  personnel.  Thus,  Russia  had  an  existing  treaty 
verification  organization,  experienced  leaders,  and  a  corps  of 
professional  inspectors  and  escorts  steeped  in  the  procedures  and 
processes  of  conducting  and  escorting  on-site  inspection  teams.17 
To  carry  out  the  provisions  of  the  CFE  Treaty,  the  INF  Treaty,  and 
the  other  arms  control  agreements,  the  Russian  center  had  ap¬ 
proximately  150  to  200  personnel. 

General-Lieutenant  Vladimir  I.  Medvedev,  Director  of  the 
NRRC,  selected  General-Major  Sergey  Fedorovich  Tsygankov  to 
lead  CFE  Treaty  operations.  Six  months  before  state  representa¬ 
tives  signed  the  CFE  Treaty  in  Paris,  Tsygankov  arrived  in  Mos¬ 
cow  to  become  Deputy  Director  of  the  NRRC.  He  began  all  of  his 
preparations,  he  said,  “with  the  treaty  theory.”18  He  also  drew 
upon  his  years  of  service  with  the  Soviet  Armed  Forces  Group  of 
Western  Forces,  where  he  had  participated  in  inspections  under  the 
Stockholm  Document.  In  selecting  CFE  team  chiefs,  deputies,  and 
inspectors,  General  Tsygankov  worked  closely  with  General 
Medvedev  and  Colonel  S.N.  Slepnev,  Director  of  Operations  for 
the  CFE  Treaty  Section.  For  team  leaders  they  selected  career 
military  officers  with  at  least  15  years  of  service.  General 
Tsygankov  indicated  that  some  of  Russia’s  CFE  team  chiefs  had 
been  “regimental  commanders,”  others  had  held  important  “staff 
positions,”  and  all  “were  considered  professionals.”  The  key  ele¬ 
ment,  he  declared,  in  the  selection  of  team  chiefs  was  their  “leader¬ 
ship  skills.”  He  observed,  “Almost  every  officer  in  the  center 
works  as  an  inspection  team  leader  or  as  an  escort  team  leader. 
When  they  go  on  an  inspection,  they  are  responsible  for  supervis-

ing  at  least  nine  people.  When  you  are  assigned  to  the  escort  team, 
you  are  to  some  extent  the  leader  of  the  inspection  facility,  so  you 
are  in  charge  of  that  facility.  The  inspection  team  leader,  or  the 
escort  team  leader,  is  the  representative  of  Russia.  This  is  a  very 
important  appointment  because  everything  that  he  says  is  on  be¬ 
half  of  Russia.”19 

The  Belarus  National  Agency  for  Control  and  Inspection 
(NAKI)  was  established  in  June  1992,  just  weeks  before  the  CFE 
Treaty  entered  into  force.  Under  the  treaty,  Belarus  had  87  sites 
subject  to  inspection.  Even  more  important,  the  nation  had  a  reduc¬ 
tion  liability  of  1,873  tanks,  1,441  armored  personnel  vehicles,  and 
130  fighters.  This  was  a  significant  reduction  liability,  especially 
since  Belarus  was  a  newly  independent  nation,  having  achieved  its 
independence  in  December  1991  following  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet 
Union.  When  the  national  verification  agency  was  set  up,  the  presi¬ 
dent  made  it  directly  subordinate  to  the  Deputy  Minister  of  Defense 
for  Military  Policy  of  the  Republic.  General-Major  Viktor  K.  Vakar 
served  as  the  agency’s  first  Commander. 

Although  the  Belarussian  agency  was  set  up  just  weeks  before 
the  CFE  Treaty  entered  into  force,  the  initial  cadre  of  inspectors, 
escorts,  and  linguists  had  had  experience  under  the  Soviet  Union  in 
implementing  arms  control  treaties  and  agreements.  Belarus  had 
been  a  Soviet  military  district  with  27  sites  subject  to  inspection 
under  the  INF  Treaty.  From  1988  through  1991,  U.S.  inspection 
teams  had  conducted  more  than  100  INF  Treaty  inspections  in 
Belarus.  Two  major  INF  Treaty  reduction  centers,  Fesnaya  and 
Stankovo,  had  been  located  within  the  Byelorussian  Military  Dis¬ 
trict.  Most  of  the  officers  and  specialists  who  operated  these  re¬ 
duction  centers  were  incorporated  into  the  new  Belarus  National 
Agency  for  Control  and  Inspection. 

The  Belarus  NAKI  had  five  divisions:  planning,  operational 
communications  and  information  systems,  international  relations, 
escorting  and  inspecting,  and  support  and  logistics.  Colonel  M.Y. 
Melomedov,  Deputy  Chief  of  NAKI,  explained  that  the  escort  and 
inspection  division  had  responsibility  for  hosting  all  foreign  in¬ 
spection  teams  that  would  be  monitoring  Belarus’s  substantial 
reduction  liabilities.  To  reduce  its  large  quantities  of  allotted  tanks, 
artillery,  and  armored  personnel  vehicles,  Belarus  set  up  three 
reduction  centers  at  Borisov,  Stankovo,  and  Baranovichi.  Accord¬ 
ing  to  Ft.  Colonel  I.G.  Gerus,  Group  Feader,  CFE  Treaty  Reduc¬ 
tion  Division,  the  first  task  was  to  “prepare  the  reduction  sites. 
There,  the  most  complicated  issue  was  to  prepare  a  technology  for 
setting  up  a  reduction  line.”20  The  reduction  of  all  1,837  tanks  in 
accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  treaty’s  reduction  protocols, 
Ft.  Colonel  Gerus  explained,  took  considerable  planning  and 
expense  by  the  Belarus  NAKI  and  the  armed  forces.  He  observed 
that  “We  spent  a  lot  of  effort  just  organizing  the  reduction  effort.”

The  initial  manning  for  the  Belarussian  verification  center  called 
for  an  authorized  strength  of  87,  although  the  actual  number  of 
officers  and  specialists  at  the  treaty’s  entry  into  force  was  less  than 
50.  The  agency’s  headquarters  was  located  in  Minsk,  the  nation’s 
capital.  Under  the  CFE  Treaty,  Minsk  was  designated  as  a  point  of 
entry  for  arriving  and  departing  inspection  teams.21 

Ukraine  was  another  new  nation  with  significant  CFE  Treaty 
rights  and  responsibilities.  In  defining  its  foreign  policy  and  mili¬ 
tary  department  treaty  responsibilities,  the  Ukrainian  government 
set  up  a  new,  presidential-level  national  committee.  Led  by 
Konstantyn  Gryschenko,  a  senior  diplomat,  this  new  National 
Committee  for  Disarmament  reported  directly  to  the  president.  Its 
staff  and  offices  were  located  in  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs, 
where  it  was  responsible  for  representing  Ukraine  at  the  negotiat¬ 
ing  sessions  of  the  CFE  Treaty’s  JCG  in  Vienna,  and  in  future 
negotiations  on  other  international  arms  control  treaties,  such  as 
the  Open  Skies  and  START  treaties.  This  national  committee  also 
collected,  processed,  and  prepared  Ukraine’s  CFE  Treaty  data  and 
reports.22 

The  Verification  Center  of  the  Armed  Forces  of  Ukraine  was 
located  in  Kiev,  and  was  organized  under  the  Ministry  of  Defense. 
According  to  General-Major  N.T.  Honcharenko,  Director,  the 
center  had  four  departments:  conventional  armed  forces,  open 
skies,  nuclear  disarmament,  and  administration.  When  the  center 
was  established  in  May  1992,  it  had  approximately  50  officers  and 
civilians.  Subordinate  to  the  verification  center  were  four  treaty

implementation  support  centers.  Located  in  Kiev  (army  and  air 
force),  Odessa,  and  Lvov,  each  center  was  manned  with  25  to  45 
military  personnel.23 

Before  the  Ukrainian  government  established  its  Verification 
Center  of  the  Armed  Forces  in  May  1992,  General  Honcharenko 
said  the  government  hosted  several  small,  high-level  delegations 
from  other  CFE  Treaty  states.  These  groups  presented  an  informal 
briefing,  explaining  their  assigned  roles  and  missions,  their  organi¬ 
zational  structure,  and  their  experiences  in  implementing  various 
treaties.  In  April  1992,  a  team  arrived  in  Kiev  from  the  Canadian 
Verification  Agency.  In  June  1992,  Dr.  Edward  M.  Ifft,  Deputy 
Director  for  External  Affairs,  OSIA,  led  a  small,  six-person  Ameri¬ 
can  team  to  Kiev.  He  was  accompanied  by  Colonel  William  R. 
Smith,  the  new  Commander  of  OSIA’s  European  Operations  Com¬ 
mand,  two  planning  officers,  and  two  linguists.  They  explained 
OSIA’s  charter,  structure,  and  treaty  experiences. 

The  visit  to  Kiev  was  part  of  an  extended  21 -day  trip  to  seven 
CFE  Treaty  states  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States: 
Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  Belarus,  Georgia,  Kazakstan,  Moldova,  and 
Ukraine.  Colonel  Smith’s  impression  of  the  preparations  of  Belarus 
and  Ukraine  was  favorable.  “In  Minsk  and  Kiev  we  met  with  large 
groups  of  people  who  knew  a  lot  about  arms  control.”  He  found 
that  “they  had  set  up  very  professional  organizations,”  and  were 
well  prepared  to  carry  out  their  treaty  responsibilities.24  Smith 
learned  that  the  Ukrainians  had  researched  many  of  the  national 
verification  centers  and  agencies.  General  Honcharenko  said  they 
had  studied  reports  from  treaty  verification  centers  in  Great  Brit¬ 
ain,  Germany,  and  the  United  States.

In  addition  to  reviewing  the  structure  and  mission  of  other 
nations’  verification  centers,  General  Honcharenko  explained  that 
“Our  verification  center  was  founded  on  the  base  of  the  imple¬ 
mentation  department  of  the  Kiev  Military  District.”  That  depart¬ 
ment  had  been  established  by  the  Soviet  Union  to  carry  out  the 
INF  Treaty.  Honcharenko  indicated  that  “most  of  the  officers  who 
had  served  in  that  department  ...  became  the  officers  of  the  Ukrai¬ 
nian  verification  center.”  In  May  and  June  of  1992,  the  center 
organized  special  training  for  its  escort  teams.  Personnel  also  went 
to  every  unit  of  the  Ukrainian  military  forces  and  held  classes  on 
how  to  prepare  OOVs  for  inspection.  Then  they  conducted  a 
full-scale  mock  inspection  with  the  units,  sending  an  inspection 
and  escort  team  from  the  verification  center.  Finally,  General 
Honcharenko  said  that  they  conducted  a  few  joint  mock  training 
inspections  with  teams  from  the  United  States  and  Germany.25 

From  these  different  national  experiences  in  establishing  CFE 
Treaty  inspection  organizations,  certain  generalizations  emerge.  To 
begin  with,  all  NATO,  Eastern  European,  and  USSR  successor 
states  recruited,  trained,  and  used  their  professional  military  as 
CFE  Treaty  inspectors  and  escorts.  In  the  NATO  nations,  the 
selection,  training,  and  leadership  responsibilities  of  the  inspection 
team  leaders  were  quite  similar  in  all  of  the  inspectorates.  The 
selection  of  inspectors  varied,  however.  The  larger  verification 
agencies — those  in  the  United  States,  Germany,  France,  and  Great 
Britain — used  a  concept  of  organic,  fixed  teams,  while  the  smaller 
verification  organizations — those  in  Holland,  Belgium,  Luxem¬ 
bourg,  and  Italy — opted  for  composite  teams  with  permanent 
leaders  and  linguists  as  the  core  team.  Inspectors  drawn  from  the 
military  forces  augmented  the  teams. 


Among  the  Warsaw  Pact  nations,  there  was  a  similar  concep¬ 
tual  distinction.  Russia,  with  its  INF  Treaty  experience,  used  the 
fixed  team  model  for  escort  and  inspection  operations  under  the 
CFE  Treaty.  Belarus  and  Ukraine  focused  their  operations  on 
escorting,  but  here  again,  they  used  professional  military  officers 
dedicated  to  implementing  the  treaty.  In  both  nations,  the  national 
CFE  Treaty  obligations  were  substantial  in  terms  of  the  numbers 
of  OOVs  and  TLE  subject  to  inspection.  The  likelihood  of  these 
sites  and  units  being  inspected  by  the  NATO  nations  was  con¬ 
siderable;  consequently,  the  greatest  burden  in  both  Belarus  and 
Ukraine  fell  to  the  escorting  mission.  Further,  the  poor  economic 
conditions  in  these  nations  after  the  collapse  of  the  centralized 
Soviet  Union  limited  their  governments’  capability  to  organize  and 
send  CFE  inspection  teams  abroad.  Hungary,  Czechoslovakia, 
and,  to  a  degree,  Poland  used  composite  inspection  and  escort 
teams. 


Final  Preparations:  NATO  and  WTO  Nations 


Local  escorts  hosted  INF  inspections  in  the  Soviet  Union;  later  they  brought  their  experience 
to  the  newly  formed  national  verification  agencies. 

Other  generalizations  applied.  Among  CFE  inspection  team 
leaders,  virtually  all  were  colonels  or  lieutenant  colonels.  As  com¬ 
missioned  officers,  they  had  trained  and  served  with  their  respec¬ 
tive  military  forces  during  the  Cold  War.  Within  the  NATO  alli¬ 
ance,  these  senior  and  mid-level  officers  had  served  in  NATO 
military  commands  or  on  combined  staffs;  thus  they  were  familiar 
with  the  military  structure  of  the  national  armies  and  air  forces  of 
the  16  NATO  nations.  By  1990,  NATO  was  a  mature,  experi¬ 
enced,  cohesive  alliance,  and  this  fact  contributed  directly  to  plan¬ 
ning,  training,  and  communicating  operational  concepts  in  imple¬ 
menting  the  CFE  Treaty. 

The  Warsaw  Treaty  Organization  (WTO)  experience  was 
considerably  different.  There  the  Soviet  Union — and  by  extension 
Russia — commanded  the  dominant  role.  Within  its  officer  corps, 
there  was  a  clear  sense  of  professionalism  and  commitment  to 
direction  from  Moscow.  Compared  to  NATO  nations,  there  was 
far  less  communication  among  the  former  nations  of  the  Warsaw 
Pact.  Among  the  states  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  Belarus  and 
Ukraine  had  team  chiefs  who  had,  with  some  exceptions,  direct 
experience  with  escorting  American  inspection  teams  monitoring 
Soviet  missile  eliminations  under  the  INF  Treaty.  Thus  they  shared 
a  distinct  set  of  experiences  with  Russian  inspectors  and  escorts. 


146 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


One  final  generalization  applied:  the  directors, 
commandants,  and  commanders  of  the  national 
CFE  Treaty  inspection  agencies  saw  their  or¬ 
ganizations  and  inspection/escort  teams  as 
implementers  of  the  treaty.  Their  mission  was  to 
monitor  on-site  the  entitlements  and  obligations 
of  the  respective  nations;  they  did  not  articulate 
policy  or  advocate  future  agreements.  Theirs  was 
a  limited  role. 

Patterns  of  Training 

A  distinctive  pattern  of  training  emerged 
during  the  20-month  period  from  CFE  Treaty 
signature  in  November  1990  to  entry  into  force 
in  July  1992.  This  pattern  applied  in  both  the 
larger,  separate  national  verification  agencies  and 
in  the  smaller,  cadre  type  of  inspection  organiza¬ 
tions.  The  key  concept  was  the  use  of  mock 
inspections  in  which  two  teams  of  inspectors,  an 
inspection  and  an  escort  team,  conducted  a  full- 
scale  on-site  inspection  at  an  active  military 
installation  using  the  CFE  Treaty  as  “the  law." 

All  the  treaty’s  provisions  and  protocols  applied, 
from  the  team’s  arrival  at  a  treaty-designated 
POE  through  the  conduct  of  a  detailed,  thorough 
inspection,  to  the  inspection  and  escort  team 
leaders’  signatures  on  the  final  inspection  report.  A  joint  evalua¬ 
tion  followed  each  mock  inspection,  with  the  participation  of 
the  two  teams,  the  military  installation  commander,  and  invited 
observers.  As  Colonel  Lawrence  Kelley,  the  Director  of  Operations 
for  OSIA’s  European  Operations  Command,  declared,  “Mock 
inspections  are  now  and  have  always  been  the  single  most  impor¬ 
tant  training  tool  that  we  have  at  our  disposal.”26 

In  setting  up  the  U.S.  CFE  inspection  operations,  Colonel 
Kelley  established  a  three-pronged  approach  for  these  training 
inspections.  One  involved  a  series  of  mock  inspections  conducted 
with  inspection  teams  from  the  NATO  nations.  Rigorous  and 
thorough,  these  inspections  developed  a  common  understanding  of 
the  process,  the  CFE  Treaty,  and  national  obligations  of  the 
inspectorates.  Another  had  American  CFE  inspection  teams  con¬ 
duct  rigorous  mock  inspections  opposite  other  American  teams  on 
U.S.  military  sites  and  installations  throughout  Europe.  These 
training  inspections  educated  both  the  American  inspection  teams 
and  the  American  military  personnel  at  each  of  the  installations, 
from  the  security  police  at  the  gate  to  the  combat  commander  at 
the  unit  that  was  the  object  of  verification.  Participants  tested  all

aspects  of  the  on-site  inspection  protocols,  particularly  the  line 
between  the  treaty  rights  of  the  inspectors  and  the  treaty  obliga¬ 
tions  of  the  inspected  state.  The  final  aspect  of  the  American  ap¬ 
proach  had  U.S.  inspection  teams  participating  in  a  series  of  mock 
inspections  with  Russia  and  the  Eastern  European  nations. 
Through  mock  inspections  with  Russia,  Poland,  Hungary,  Czecho¬ 
slovakia,  Romania,  and  Bulgaria,  OSIA  built  early  and  continuing 
liaisons.  The  mock  inspections  initiated  these  ties,  and  over  the 
course  of  many  discussions  among  inspectors  and  escorts,  and 
directors  and  commanders,  common  approaches  to  many  areas  of 
treaty  implementation  developed.27 

Among  the  other  NATO  nations  preparing  to  implement  the 
CFE  Treaty,  a  three-stage  training  pattern  emerged:  mock  inspec¬ 
tions  with  the  national  military  forces,  mock  inspections  with 
allied  inspection  teams  and  their  organizations,  and  finally,  mock 
inspections  with  the  inspection  agencies  of  the  former  Warsaw 
Pact  nations  and  their  military  forces.  These  latter  mock  inspec¬ 
tions  usually  were  planned  and  organized  on  a  reciprocal  basis, 
with  inspections  in  one  nation  followed  by  inspections  in  the  other. 
Because  nation-to-nation  relationships  varied  considerably  across 
the  European  continent,  there  was  no  set  order  or  sequence  to  this 
pattern  of  inspections.  In  some  nations,  mock  inspections  with 
allied  nations  preceded  training  inspections  with  their  own  mili¬ 
tary  forces.  In  others,  mock  training  events  with  former  Warsaw 
Pact  nations  were  scheduled  before  similar  events  with  NATO 
allies. 


Group  Captain  D.A.G.  Bremner,  Commandant  of  the  United 
Kingdom’s  Joint  Arms  Control  Implementation  Group  (JACIG), 
explained  that  British  inspector  training  began  with  an  intensive 
four-week  course  on  the  CFE  Treaty  and  other  current  arms  con¬ 
trol  agreements.  Then  team  training  began  with  the  agency’s  in¬ 
spectors  “simulating  a  foreign  inspection  group  and  a  JACIG 
escort  team  conducting  mock  inspections  at  United  Kingdom 
sites.”28  According  to  Group  Captain  Bremner,  these  inspections 
developed  team  skills  and  standard  operating  procedures  for  both 
the  British  military  installation  commanders  and  the  British  inspec¬ 
tion  group’s  escort  and  inspection  teams.  Next,  the  British  group 
arranged  and  conducted  bilateral  mock  training  inspections  with 
teams  from  the  inspectorates  of  the  NATO  nations,  and  then  they 
set  up  a  series  of  mock  training  exercises  with  the  nations  of  the 
Warsaw  Pact  from  mid-1991  to  mid-1992.  The  French  experience, 
according  to  Colonel  Francois  Rozec,  Commandant,  L’Unite 
Frangaise  de  Verification,  followed  a  pattern  similar  to  that  of  the 
other  NATO  nations’  inspection  agencies.  “All  of  the  verification 
agencies,”  Colonel  Rozec  explained,  “more  or  less,  worked  along 
the  same  lines.  We  first  started  doing  mock  inspections  on  a  na¬ 
tional  level,  then  bilaterally  with  the  NATO  allies.  Then,  as  a  third

step,  we  started  working  on  mock  inspections  with  the  Eastern 
bloc  countries,  especially  with  Russia,  Belarus,  Hungary,  and 
Czechoslovakia.”29 

Germany  developed  one  of  the  most  extensive  training  pro¬ 
grams  of  the  NATO  nations.  To  begin  with,  the  unified  German 
nation,  because  of  its  incorporation  of  East  Germany’s  military 
forces  and  equipment,  had  more  than  900  CFE  Treaty  OOVs, 
more  than  any  other  NATO  nation.  All  of  these  sites  had  to  be 
surveyed  and  their  personnel  trained  and  prepared  for  on-site 
inspections  under  the  CFE  Treaty.  Since  most,  if  not  all,  of  the 
former  GDR’s  military  equipment  was  either  Soviet-made  or  built 
to  Soviet  military  specifications,  it  provided  a  training  windfall  for 
German  CFE  Treaty  inspection  teams.  Germany  was  one  of  the 
principal  NATO  nations  for  implementing  the  CFE  Treaty.  Ger¬ 
man  inspection  teams  would  be  leading  and  conducting  20  percent 
of  the  NATO  alliance’s  inspection  quota.  Another  important  op¬ 
erational  consideration  driving  Germany’s  training  was  the  fact 
that  many  of  NATO’s  military  installations  and  CFE  reduction 
sites  were  located  on  German  territory.  When  the  Eastern  group  of 
states’  CFE  teams  conducted  inspections  on  stationed  forces’  mili¬ 
tary  units  and  equipment  located  on  German  territory,  German 
escort  officers  had  to  meet  them  at  the  point  of  entry,  transport 
them  to  the  declared  military  installation,  and,  following  the  in¬ 
spection,  accompany  them  back  to  the  exit  point.  Germany  had  to 
anticipate,  over  the  40-month  reduction  phase,  dozens  of  inspec¬ 
tion  teams  arriving  at  designated  points  of  entry  in  the  former 


Final  Preparations:  NATO  and  WTO  Nations  149 


German  Democratic  Republic,  traveling  under  escort  to  the  reduc¬ 
tion  sites,  and  then,  for  a  period  of  days,  monitoring  TLE  destruc¬ 
tion.  Finally,  because  of  Germany’s  strategic  position  in  middle 
Europe,  its  national  political  leaders  encouraged  and  supported 
joint  training  with  all  the  Central  European  national  verification 
agencies  during  preparations  for  implementing  the  CFE  Treaty.  For 
all  these  reasons,  the  German  verification  agency  was  extremely 
active  during  the  20-month  treaty  preparation  phase.30 

By  the  time  of  the  CFE  Treaty’s  entry  into  force  in  July  1992, 
the  Germans  had  conducted  more  than  200  mock  inspections  and 
escort  missions.  Brigadier  General  Doctor  Heinz  Loquai,  Director, 
ZVBW,  recalled  a  particularly  important  series  of  mock  inspec¬ 
tions: 


“We  arranged  with  the  Eastern  European  countries,  the 
former  Warsaw  Pact  countries,  a  series  of  test  inspections  or  mock 
inspections  in  order  to  establish  with  them  practical  cooperation.  I 
think  one  of  the  most  crucial  mock  inspections  was  our  inspection 
in  the  Soviet  Union.  It  was  agreed  on  at  the  ministerial  level  and 
took  place  in  August  1991.  Two  guest  inspectors  participated  in 
this  inspection,  a  Dutch  and  a  French  inspector.  Two  weeks  later, 
the  Soviets  came  to  Germany,  conducting  an  inspection  on  a  Ger¬ 
man  site....  These  were  revolutionary  times,  with  the  attempted 
coup  d’etat  in  Moscow,  but  I  was  convinced  that  if  the  coup  had 
succeeded,  the  new  government  would  have  done  everything  to 
fulfill  the  obligations  of  the  CFE  Treaty.”31 


The  Russian  experience  in  training  paralleled  in  many  re¬ 
spects  the  experiences  of  the  other  large  state  parties  to  the  treaty. 
In  explaining  Russia’s  training  concept,  General-Major  Tsygankov, 
Deputy  Director  of  the  Russian  NRRC,  was  characteristically 
forthright:  “The  most  important  task  was  to  prepare  the  training 
for  our  forces.  Objects  of  verification  must  be  prepared,  beginning 
with  diagrams  of  the  declared  sites.  The  correct  stand  on  these 
issues  must  come  from  the  NRRC.”32  The  Russian  center  handled 
virtually  every  aspect  of  treaty  preparations,  from  drawing  up  site 
diagrams,  to  designating  administrative  zones,  to  defining  the 
OOVs.  Every  Russian  military  district,  according  to  General 
Tsygankov,  had  an  arms  control  department,  staffed  with  10  to  16 
persons.  Officers  from  the  Russian  NRRC  trained  these  district 
officers  on  the  CFE  Treaty.  Every  Russian  army  division  had  two 
or  three  CFE  Treaty  specialists  assigned  to  the  division’s  training 
brigade.  The  scope  of  the  CFE  Treaty  and  the  size  of  the  Russian 
Army  meant  that  training  had  to  be  reinforced  by  regulations  and 
regular  training  visits  from  NRRC  officials.  In  July  1992,  at  the 
time  of  the  CFE  Treaty’s  entry  into  force,  Russia  declared  9,342 
tanks,  8,346  artillery  pieces,  19,399  armored  personnel  carriers, 
and  4,624  aircraft.  This  vast  array  of  treaty  equipment  was  main¬ 
tained  at  488  declared  sites  and  503  OOVs  throughout  Russia.33 


“The  most  important  task 
was  to  prepare  the  training 
for  our  forces.  ”

Deputy  Director,  Russian  NRRC

On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


From  April  to  July  1991,  General  Tsygankov  had  the  CFE 
Treaty  section  plan  and  organize  mock  inspections  with  several 
military  commands  and  units  of  the  army,  air  force,  and  air  de¬ 
fense  forces.  Their  objective  was  to  train  the  inspection  teams  and 
Soviet  forces  on  the  practical  aspects  of  treaty  implementation. 
They  conducted  full-scale  CFE  inspections  at  several  facilities  of 
the  army,  air  force,  and  air  defense  forces.  “Our  approach,”  Gen¬ 
eral  Tsygankov  stated,  “was  that  we  call  it  a  training  inspection  if 
we  carried  it  out  with  our  people  on  Russian  territory,  but  we  call 
it  a  mock  inspection  if  inspectors  from  a  foreign  country  partici¬ 
pated.”34  From  August  1991  to  April  1992,  the  Russian  NRRC 
conducted  mock  inspections  on  a  mutual  basis  with  seven  treaty 
states — the  United  States,  Great  Britain,  Germany,  Denmark, 
Turkey,  Holland,  and  France.  Observers  participated  in  the  post¬ 
training  inspection  debriefing  in  all  these  mock  inspections.3" 

It  is  important  to  remember  that  throughout  this  lengthy,  20- 
month  CFE  Treaty  training  phase,  Eastern  Europe  was  in  turmoil. 
The  Soviet  Union  was  in  revolution,  and  it  ceased  to  exist  as  a 
nation  in  late  1991.  After  its  collapse,  eight  new  states  became 
signatory  parties  to  the  CFE  Treaty.  Throughout  these  changes, 
CFE  inspection  teams  from  the  NATO  nations  and  the  Warsaw 
Pact  nations,  including  the  successor  states  of  Russia,  Ukraine,  and 
Belarus,  conducted  several  hundred  CFE  Treaty  mock  inspections. 
They  refined  all  aspects  of  treaty  implementation,  from  communi¬ 
cations,  to  inspection/escort  procedures,  to  logistics.  Slowly  and 
deliberately,  a  consensus  emerged  over  time  among  the  national 
inspectorates  on  certain  “understandings  of  the  treaty,”  as  did  a 
general  agreement  on  what  constituted  “standards  of  an  inspec¬

tion.”  These  by-products  of  extensive  bilateral  and  multilateral 
mock  training  inspections  would  become  even  more  significant 
when  the  treaty  entered  into  force.  Consensus,  especially  when 
based  on  actual  experience,  became  a  powerful  instrument  in 
implementing  this  multinational  arms  reduction  treaty. 

In  negotiating  the  CFE  Treaty,  diplomats  in  Vienna  had 
reached  an  understanding  of  the  treaty’s  language,  protocols,  and 
requirements.  Now,  in  preparing  to  implement  the  treaty,  leaders 
of  the  national  inspectorates  were  trying  to  reach  a  similar  mea¬ 
sure  of  understanding  about  the  practical,  operational  aspects  of 
conducting  recurring  on-site  inspections.  Given  the  turmoil  across 
Central  and  Eastern  Europe  in  1991  to  1992,  the  significance  of 
these  national  agency-to-agency,  military-to-military  mock  training 
inspections  cannot  be  underestimated.  They  occurred,  like  the  CFE 
Treaty  itself,  on  the  cusp  of  major  political  and  economic  changes 
across  the  European  continent. 


Readiness  for  Entry  into  Force 

When  the  diplomats  met  at  the  CSCE  summit  in  Helsinki 
on  July  10,  1992,  they  signed  documents  that  permitted  the  CFE 
Treaty  to  enter  into  force  provisionally.  Ten  days  later,  CFE  Treaty 
baseline  inspections  would  begin.  Were  the  respective  national 
verification  agencies  ready?  Were  the  military  forces  prepared? 

Had  the  site  diagrams  been  drawn  properly,  were  the  POEs  ready, 
were  the  nation-to-nation  communications  systems  ready  to  go? 

By  and  large,  directors  of  verification  agencies  were  confi¬ 
dent.  At  the  German  verification  center  in  Geilenkirchen,  General 
Loquai  stated  unequivocally  that  they  were  ready.  Only  a  few 
weeks  before,  the  German  center  had  organized  a  maximum-level 
mock  inspection  exercise  involving  inspection  teams  from  the 
United  States,  Canada,  France,  Great  Britain,  and,  of  course,  Ger¬ 
many.  Within  one  week,  these  national  teams  conducted  10  on-site 
inspections,  exercising  every  element  of  the  inspection  process: 
notifications,  communications,  security,  logistics,  site  preparations, 
escort  procedures,  inspection  rights,  photography,  emergency 
procedures,  and  report  sequencing.  “The  normal  military  logic,” 
General  Loquai  observed,  “is  that  you  should  perform  training 
exercises  under  conditions  more  difficult  than  real  life.”36  After 
completing  this  training  exercise  without  incident,  General  Loquai 
knew  the  German  agency  was  ready.  Germany  had  conducted 
more  than  200  mock  training  inspections  prior  to  entry  into  force. 

Directors  at  other  agencies  also  were  ready.  At  the  Belgian 
verification  agency,  Lt.  Colonel  Fred  Janssen,  Director  of  Opera¬ 
tions,  expressed  his  confidence,  declaring,  “Without  any  doubt  we 
were  ready,  more  than  ready,  I  should  say.  We  were  eager  to  go 
in.”37  The  Belgians  had  conducted  56  mock  inspections  prior  to 


152 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


entry  into  force.  At  the  French  verification  unit  in  Creil,  Colonel 
Rozec  acknowledged,  “I  think  we  were  ready,  considering  that  you 
can  never  be  completely  ready  for  this  kind  of  job....  Some  of  our 
new  inspectors  were  not  on  the  list  of  inspectors,  but  we  were  as 
ready  as  we  could  possibly  be.”38  In  Warsaw,  Colonel  Malinowski 
noted  that  the  period  from  treaty  signature  to  entry  into  force  was 
“a  long  time.”  He  believed  that  Polish  armed  forces  were  well 
prepared  and  that  the  verification  center  was  ready:  “I  wouldn’t 
like  to  boast,  but  I  think  that  Poland,  the  United  States,  Nether¬ 
lands,  Germany,  and  Britain  were  very  well  prepared  at  that 
time.”39  In  Moscow,  General-Major  Tsygankov  had  reached  a 
similar  conclusion:  “The  center  was  ready.  The  center  had  a  mis¬ 
sion,  and  we  were  responsible  for  carrying  it  out.  We  knew  that 
when  the  treaty  entered  into  force,  there  would  be  no  time  for 
further  preparations.”40  In  Frankfurt,  Colonel  Kelley,  speaking  of 
the  U.S.  effort,  concluded,  “I  think  that  although  the  butterflies 
were  there,  and  although  there  were  certain  areas  where  we  were 
not  quite  satisfied  that  we  had  the  optimal  solution,  communica¬ 
tions,  liaison  officers,  transportation,  operations  center,  we  did  feel 
at  entry  into  force  that  operationally,  we  were  ready.”41 

Colonel  Kelley’s  next  comment,  provided  with  the  perspective 
of  thinking  back  over  all  the  inspection  and  escort  operations 
conducted  during  the  CFE  Treaty  baseline  phase,  was  both  short 
and  insightful:  “And,  that  turned  out  to  be  the  case.”42

Chapter  6 


American  and  Russian  team  chiefs  sign  the  report  completing  the  inspection  of  Russian  forces  in  Gyandzha, 
Azerbaijan. 

On  July  17,  1992,  the  CFE  Treaty  entered  into  force,  albeit 
provisionally.  While  Armenia,  Belarus,  and  Kazakstan 
had  not  yet  ratified  the  treaty,  by  early  July  their  represen¬ 
tatives  assured  other  nations  in  Vienna  that  they  would  soon 
ratify.  Consequently,  when  the  European  and  North  American 
leaders  arrived  at  the  Helsinki  Summit  on  July  10,  1992,  they  were 
prepared  to  sign  the  CFE  1A  Agreement  and  to  approve  the  CFE 
Treaty’s  provisional  entry  into  force.  As  promised,  Armenia  depos¬ 
ited  its  instrument  of  ratification  at  The  Hague  on  October  12, 

1992,  and  Belarus  and  Kazakstan  followed  on  October  30,  1992. 

Two  weeks  later,  the  29-nation  Joint  Consultative  Group  (JCG) 
assembled  in  Vienna  and  confirmed  that  the  treaty  had  officially 
entered  into  force  10  days  after  the  final  instruments  of  ratification 
had  been  deposited.  Consequently,  the  provisional  entry  into  force 
status  ended  on  November  9,  1992.  Regardless,  the  formal  date 
for  the  CFE  Treaty’s  entry  into  force  remained  July  17,  1992.' 


156 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


NATO's  VCC  allotted  the 
United  States  a  total  of  45 
baseline  inspections. 


U.S.  Inspection  Quotas 
Passive — 8% 

Active — 1 8% 


The  start  of  the  treaty’s  baseline  phase  was  not  a  shotgun 
blast  of  national  inspection  teams  racing  across  Europe.  Instead, 
NATO  nations  dispatched  their  teams  according  to  a  coordinated, 
well-planned  schedule.  This  was  necessary  to  prevent  inspection 
teams  of  different  NATO  nations  from  trying  to  inspect  the  same 
site  simultaneously  or  sending  too  many  teams  into  one  country  at 
once.  The  treaty’s  Protocol  on  Inspection  limited  the  number  of 
teams  a  nation  was  required  to  host  at  any  given  time  within  its 
national  territory  or  at  any  given  declared  site.  In  addition,  the 
protocol  dictated  the  number  of  inspections  any  nation  was  liable 
to  receive  during  any  period  of  the  treaty’s  life,  and  it  limited  a 
nation  to  conducting  no  more  than  50  percent  of  the  declared  site 
and  challenge  inspections  any  nation  was  liable  for  during  a  calen¬ 
dar  year.  On  the  other  hand,  there  were  no  provisions  stipulating 
how  many  inspections  any  one  nation  could  conduct  or  how  the 
inspections  were  to  be  divided  among  the  participating  states. 
There  was  no  central  monitor.  Consequently,  planning  inspection 
schedules  and  monitoring  activity  during  any  phase  of  the  treaty 
was  an  option  that  fell  to  the  two  groups  of  state  parties. 

The  NATO  Verification  Coordination  Committee  (VCC), 
with  membership  from  all  16  allied  nations,  determined  the  num¬ 
ber  of  inspections  that  each  NATO  nation  would  conduct  annu¬ 
ally.  A  starting  point  for  determining  each  nation’s  quota  of  in¬ 
spections  in  the  East  (active  quota)  was  the  number  of  inspections 
it  was  liable  to  receive  (passive  quota).  A  nation’s  passive  quota 
compared  to  the  total  NATO  passive  quota  produced  a  percentage 
that  could  be  applied  to  the  Eastern  group  of  states’  total  passive 
quota.  This  calculation  produced  a  potential  active  quota. 

The  U.S.  passive  quota  was  8  percent  of  the  passive  quota  for 
the  NATO  states.  The  VCC,  however,  agreed  to  allow  the  United 
States  an  active  quota  of  approximately  18  percent  of  the  NATO 
states’  total  share.  This  was  the  result  of  heated  debate  among 
VCC  delegates.  The  U.S.  had  requested  a  greater  share  of  the 
Eastern  inspection  quota  because  its  contributions  to  NATO  were 
not  measured  only  in  terms  of  its  OOVs.  Moreover,  the  United 
States  had  experience  in  arms  control  treaty  implementation  as 
well  as  the  financial  and  logistical  capability  to  conduct  numerous 
inspections.  On  the  other  hand,  the  United  States  was  only  one  of 
16  nations  in  the  alliance.  European  nations  wanted  their  share  of 
inspections  as  participants  in  the  security  affairs  of  Europe.  Some 
nations  did  not  set  up  verification  agencies,  only  small  sections 
with  a  handful  of  treaty  experts,  because  they  had  few  objects  of 
verification  (OOVs);  Iceland  had  none.  These  nations  were  not 
interested  in  developing  inspection  teams  and  spending  money  to 
conduct  inspections.  A  solution  to  their  needs  was  relinquishing 
inspections  to  the  United  States  with  the  proviso  that  their  inspec¬ 
tors  join  U.S.  teams  on  those  missions.  After  much  haggling  and 


157 


CFE  Treaty  Baseline 


bargaining,  the  VCC  allotted  the  United  States  a 
total  of  45  baseline  inspections  out  of  a  total  of 
251  to  be  conducted  by  NATO  allies. 

The  Verification  and  Implementation  Coor¬ 
dination  Section,  which  was  the  VCC’s  working 
staff,  had  the  task  of  taking  the  inspections  allo¬ 
cated  by  the  VCC  and  guiding  the  NATO  nations 
through  a  process  in  which  each  received  a  block 
of  time  (three  days)  and  an  Eastern  nation  to 
inspect.  Selection  of  the  specific  OOV  for  inspec¬ 
tion  was  left  to  the  NATO  state.  The  time  blocks 
were  critical  because  the  NATO  nations  had  to 
conduct  251  inspections  in  the  Eastern  states 
during  baseline — only  120  days.  This 
“deconfliction”  schedule  would  enable  the 
NATO  allies  to  conduct  all  possible  inspections 
during  baseline.  Every  state  could  benefit  from 
information  gained  and  shared  in  those  inspec¬ 
tions.

Assigning  states  to  be  inspected  was  also  important  because 
of  the  greater  demand  among  the  NATO  allies  to  inspect  OOVs 
in  Russia  than  those  in  any  other  Eastern  state.  The  coordinated 
effort  of  all  NATO  states  ensured  each  of  at  least  some  opportu¬ 
nity  to  inspect  OOVs  in  nations  that  were  important  to  them.  This 
schedule  also  precluded  NATO  states  from  exceeding  the  inspec¬ 
tion  protocol  limits  of  two  simultaneous  inspections  in  a  country 
and  one  inspection  team  on  a  declared  site.2  The  first  NATO  states 
to  conduct  inspections  were  Canada  and  the  United  States.  The 
Canadians  notified  the  Russians  that  they  would  arrive  for  a  de¬ 
clared  site  inspection  on  July  17,  1992.  On  the  day  the  Canadians 
were  arriving  to  conduct  the  first  NATO  inspection,  the  U.S.  gov¬ 
ernment  notified  Russian  authorities  that  on  July  18,  1992,  an 
American  inspection  team  would  arrive  at  the  Russian  point  of 
entry  (POE),  Moscow,  for  a  declared  site  inspection.  The  differ¬ 
ence  in  dates  of  notification  reflected  a  different  interpretation  of 
implementation;  the  Canadians  viewed  the  arrival  for  the  inspec¬ 
tion  on  the  17th  as  the  first  step  of  implementation,  whereas  the 
United  States  considered  the  notification  of  intent  to  inspect  the 
first  step  of  implementation.3 


First  U.S.  Inspection 

The  first  U.S.  CFE  inspection  team,  led  by  Lt.  Colonel  Elmer 
G.  (Guy)  White,  USA,  arrived  in  Moscow  at  1700  GMT  on  July 
18,  1992.  Before  Team  White  deployed  to  Russia,  a  great  deal  of 
coordination  and  preparation  had  been  completed.  In  Washington, 
the  Arms  Control  Policy  Coordinating  Committee  had  selected

cases  known  as  “silver  bullets.” 


Buy,  Russia,  to  be  the  first  CFE  inspection  site  and  had  notified 
Headquarters  OSIA  of  the  selection.  Headquarters  OSIA  had  then 
forwarded  that  information  to  OSIA  European  Operations.  In 
Europe,  Team  White  began  its  many  checks  to  prepare  for  the 
mission.  Lt.  Colonel  White  prepared  a  “mission  warning  order”  to 
notify  his  eight  team  members  of  the  upcoming  mission  and  the 
schedule  of  briefings  required  before  departure.  Through  his  warn¬ 
ing  order,  he  also  assigned  responsibilities  for  different  elements  of 
mission  preparation  to  his  team  members.4  He  later  gave  the  Plans 
Section  the  information  necessary  to  prepare  the  “Notification  of 
Intent  to  Inspect”  message,  which  would  ultimately  arrive  in  Mos¬ 
cow  36  hours  before  the  American  inspection  team’s  arrival  there. 

The  Plans  Branch  of  OSIA’s  European  Operations  Command 
compiled  the  information  Lt.  Colonel  White  had  provided  for  the 
intent-to-inspect  message  and  forwarded  it  to  Headquarters  OSIA. 
There,  Robert  G.  Green  of  the  Treaty  List  Management  Branch 
verified  aircrew  and  team  augmentee  data  such  as  names,  birth 
dates,  and  passport  numbers.  Any  discrepancies  between  the 
Headquarters  computer  lists  and  the  data  transmitted  from  the 
European  Operations  Command  were  resolved  at  OSIA  before  the 
Headquarters  Operations  Center  forwarded  the  message  to  the 
Nuclear  Risk  Reduction  Center  (NRRC)  at  the  U.S.  State  Depart¬ 
ment.  Changes  or  discrepancies  discovered  in  treaty  inspector  or 
flight  crew  lists  would  be  corrected  in  a  “Remarks”  block  of  the 
notification.  This  action  was  critical  to  ensure  that  U.S.  inspectors 
would  be  allowed  entry  without  delay  to  conduct  their  inspections. 
Next,  the  NRRC  sent  the  official  U.S.  government  announcement 
of  intent  to  inspect  through  the  Conference  on  Security  and  Coop¬ 
eration  in  Europe  (CSCE)  network,  and  the  State  Department  sent 
the  same  message  through  diplomatic  channels.5

CFE  Treaty  Baseline 


While  Headquarters  OSIA,  the  NRRC,  and  the  State  Depart¬ 
ment  processed  the  CFE  Treaty  notification,  Team  White  contin¬ 
ued  its  preparation  for  this  first  CFE  on-site  inspection.  The 
American  inspection  team  gathered  information,  equipment,  and 
documents  required  for  their  mission.  Current  weather  reports  for 
the  inspection  area,  and  news  of  ongoing  activities  by  NATO  ally 
inspection  teams,  provided  information  that  could  improve  the 
odds  of  a  successful  mission.  The  team  checked  that  its  equipment 
was  operational  and  ready  for  deployment.  Each  team  had  its  own 
set  of  equipment  in  metal  suitcases  nicknamed  “silver  bullets.”  In 
addition  to  their  equipment,  the  team  gathered  passports,  inspec¬ 
tor  badges,  dog  tags,  bottled  water,  and  mementos  to  be  ex¬ 
changed  with  their  hosts.  Team  documents  included  maps  of  the 
area,  photos  of  the  treaty-limited  equipment  (TLE)  submitted  by 
the  inspected  nation  at  the  exchange  of  treaty  information,  CFE 
inspection  forms,  inspection  notification  messages,  copies  of  the 
treaty,  and  checklists  to  be  used  at  various  stages  of  the  inspection 
trip.  As  the  team  assembled  these  items,  Lt.  Colonel  White  worked 
with  the  Inspection  Support  Staff  (ISS)  to  develop  a  detailed  mis¬ 
sion  briefing  on  the  Russian  site  to  be  inspected. 

Lt.  Colonel  White’s  briefing  paralleled  his  mission  operations 
order.  In  both,  he  outlined  his  basic  game  plan  for  the  inspection 
mission,  covering  the  type  of  inspection,  the  specific  site,  equip¬ 
ment  subject  to  the  treaty  as  well  as  any  other  equipment  the  team 
could  anticipate  encountering  at  the  inspection  site,  and  the  com¬ 
position  of  his  inspection  team.  His  briefing  also  addressed  the 
site’s  terrain,  the  weather  forecast  for  the  mission,  and  how  those 
conditions  might  affect  the  inspection.  He  also  made  certain  that 
the  team’s  time  in  country,  from  arrival  at  the  POE  to  its  return  to 
a  POE  after  the  inspection,  would  be  under  48  hours.  The  treaty

allowed  48  hours  in  country  to  execute  a  single  declared  site  in¬ 
spection,  and  for  any  sequential  inspections  planned,  the  treaty 
allowed  an  additional  36  hours  per  inspection,  up  to  a  maximum 
of  10  days. 

White  also  set  up  three  subteams  and  planned  the  inspection 
to  ensure  redundant  coverage  of  the  entire  declared  site.  At  the 
same  time,  he  assigned  specific  responsibilities  to  individual  team 
members,  such  as  video  filming,  timekeeping,  passport  checking, 
and  monitoring  the  team  equipment  case  throughout  the  inspec¬ 
tion.  The  American  team  set  up  a  subteam  communications  plan 
to  use  during  the  inspection,  with  code  words  for  key  events.  Lt. 
Colonel  White  also  announced  the  departure  staging  area  and 
time,  where  final  checks  would  be  made  on  equipment  and 
luggage.6 

In  addition  to  White’s  briefing,  the  ISS  also  provided  team 
briefings  before  deployment.  These  included  the  latest  information 
available  about  the  inspection  site,  including  imagery  from  na¬ 
tional  technical  means  (NTM),  findings  from  inspections  under  the 
Vienna  Document,  and  the  CFE  data  exchanged.  The  ISS  briefings 
provided  an  insight  about  the  significance  of  the  site  selected  and 
guidance  on  the  kind  of  information  required  to  satisfy  U.S.  gov¬ 
ernment  concerns. 

In  addition  to  these  briefings,  the  Counterintelligence  Section 
reminded  inspectors  of  personal  and  team  security  requirements 
during  CFE  inspection  missions.  Topics  included  adherence  to  the 
two-person  rule  that  prohibited  U.S.  inspectors  from  being  alone 
outside  their  rooms  or  bathrooms  during  an  inspection  mission, 
the  policy  on  alcohol  consumption  during  a  mission,  and  guide¬ 
lines  on  what  was  appropriate  for  discussion  with  an  Eastern 
escort,  both  in  personal  and  business  matters.  The  U.S.  govern-

ment  expected  its  CFE  Treaty  inspectors  to  be  open  with  their 
Eastern  bloc  escorts,  but  to  remain  unimpeachable  in  their  behav¬ 
ior  while  implementing  the  treaty. 

Having  completed  these  final  briefings,  the  team  was  pre¬ 
pared  to  deploy  on  their  mission  to  Buy,  Russia.  Lt.  Colonel 
White’s  team,  including  OSIA’s  Director,  Major  General  Robert  W. 
Parker,  gathered  on  July  18th  to  perform  their  final  predeparture 
checks  for  this  historic  mission.  Final  checks  confirmed  that  every¬ 
one  was  on  the  flight  manifest  and  had  passports,  inspector 
badges,  and  dog  tags.  Certain  that  both  personnel  and  equipment 
were  ready  for  departure,  Lt.  Colonel  White  led  the  nine-person 
team  to  the  bus  for  the  short  ride  across  the  ramp  to  the  waiting 
military  aircraft. 

The  U.S.  Air  Force  C-141  aircraft  departed  Rhein-Main 
at  1545  Frankfurt  time,  flew  for  three  hours,  and  landed  at 
Moscow’s  Sheremetyevo  I  Airport  at  2052  Moscow  time.  As  the 
team  prepared  to  depart  the  aircraft,  General  Parker  and  Lt.  Colo¬ 
nel  White  met  the  senior  Russian  CFE  Treaty  escorts.  The  team 
chiefs  agreed  to  1700  Greenwich  mean  time  (GMT)  as  the  official 
arrival  time,  as  had  been  announced  in  the  message  of  intent  to 
inspect.  A  representative  of  the  U.S.  Embassy’s  Arms  Control 
Implementation  Unit  (ACIU)  met  the  American  inspection  team  to 
assist  them  and  the  aircrew  if  needed.  Meanwhile  Captain  Jeremy 
Wintersteen,  USAF,  the  deputy  team  chief,  gathered  passports  for

processing.  While  “in  country,”  diplomatic  privileges  and  immuni¬ 
ties  were  extended  to  inspectors  and  aircrews  as  outlined  in  the 
treaty.  Team  members  unloaded  their  gear  and,  as  planned  for  all 
changes  of  transportation,  one  member  of  the  team  performed  a 
final  sweep  for  anything  left  behind.  The  team  then  proceeded 
through  a  routine  Russian  customs  inspection  of  personal  belong¬ 
ings.  Russian  CFE  escorts  also  completed  a  treaty-specified  check 
of  American  inspection  equipment.  In  accordance  with  the  CFE 
Treaty’s  inspection  protocol,  the  U.S.  notification  of  intent  to 
inspect  specified  a  seven-hour  delay  between  arrival  time  at  the 
POE  in  Moscow  and  Lt.  Colonel  White’s  declaration  of  the  first 
inspection  site. 

Exactly  seven  hours  after  the  team’s  arrival,  Lt.  Colonel 
White  announced  to  the  Russian  escort  team  that  Buy  was  the  site 
for  the  first  U.S.  CFE  inspection.  It  was  now  0400  Moscow  time, 
0200  Frankfurt  time.8  The  American  team  had  worn  civilian 
clothes  on  the  flight  to  Moscow,  but  changed  into  field  military 
uniforms,  called  BDUs — battle  dress  uniforms — in  preparation  for 
the  trip  to  Buy.  During  INF  Treaty  inspections,  American  inspec¬ 
tors  wore  civilian  clothes  throughout  the  missions,  but  CFE  in¬ 
spections  were  to  be  conducted  in  much  more  rugged  conditions, 
so  field  uniforms  were  more  practical.  After  declaring  the  site  to  be 
inspected,  the  American  team  notified  the  ACIU  of  its  plan  to 
depart  for  Buy  and  estimated  the  time  of  arrival  at  0700  GMT  on 
July  19th. 

Nearly  three  hours  after  the  American  team  chief  had  de¬ 
clared  the  site,  the  Russians  escorted  Team  White  to  an  IL-18 
aircraft,  and  the  two  teams  left  for  Tunoshna.  After  a  two-and- 
one-half-hour  delay  in  acquiring  ground  transportation  in 
Tunoshna,  the  team  and  escorts  continued  on,  switching  vehicles 
once  again  before  arriving  at  Buy  at  0855  GMT.  The  arrival  time 
at  Buy  was  within  five  minutes  of  the  maximum  nine-hour  transit 
time  the  treaty  permitted  from  the  POE  to  the  declared  site,  in  this 
case  approximately  a  250-mile  trip.  The  treaty  allowed  the  in¬ 
spected  nation  six  hours  to  prepare  a  site  following  the  inspection 
team’s  site  declaration.  In  this  mission  the  six-hour  allowance  was 
easily  satisfied.  Despite  the  long  transport  time,  the  American  team 
was  ready  and  eager  to  begin  their  inspection. 

Shortly  after  arriving  at  Buy,  the  team  notified  the  U.S.  Em¬ 
bassy  of  its  arrival.  The  senior  Russian  escort  then  presented  the 
site  diagram  to  the  Americans.  Lt.  Colonel  White  immediately 
declared  the  22nd  Central  Tank  Reserve  Depot  as  the  object  of 
verification  for  the  inspection.  The  Russian  escorts  and  site  repre¬ 
sentatives  in  turn  commenced  a  42-minute  preinspection  briefing. 
During  this  briefing,  they  announced  the  depot’s  equipment  quan¬ 
tities;  they  were  considerably  higher  than  Russian  data  had  previ¬ 
ously  indicated  in  November  1990.  A  correction  to  the  1990  infor-

mation  had  been  made  in  February  1991,  but  even  that  was  17 
months  ago.  The  Russian  military  had  experienced  many  changes 
since  then,  just  as  the  U.S.  military  had  in  Europe.  The  Russian 
February  1991  data  were  outdated  and  would  be  updated  soon, 
but  that  was  one  reason  for  the  on-site  preinspection  briefing:  to 
update  information  and  explain  any  differences. 

The  Russian  briefing  provided  the  U.S.  team  with  specific 
quantities  of  the  various  CFE  Treaty  equipment  on-site,  an  expla¬ 
nation  for  the  dramatic  increase  of  equipment  since  the  CFE  data 
had  been  exchanged,  and  a  listing,  to  be  attached  to  the  inspection 
report,  providing  information  on  when  the  additional  equipment 
had  arrived  and  where  it  had  come  from.  Three  categories  of 
equipment  were  present  on  the  declared  site:  tanks,  armored  com¬ 
bat  vehicles  (ACVs),  and  ACV  look-alikes.  In  1991,  Soviet  data 
had  indicated  that  there  were  no  tanks  at  Buy;  but  now,  in  July 
1992,  the  Russian  military  briefers  informed  the  American  team 
that  there  were  996  tanks  on  site.  The  number  of  ACVs  briefed 
was  301  versus  a  reported  holding  of  31.  The  number  of  ACV 
look-alikes  briefed  was  176  more  than  previously  reported.  The 
Russians  also  provided  safety  and  administrative  information 
specific  to  the  22nd  Central  Tank  Reserve  Depot. M 

With  approximately  31  hours  remaining  for  the  American 
team  to  complete  its  inspection  and  return  to  the  POE,  Lt.  Colonel 
White  broke  the  team  into  three  subteams  and  began  counting  the 
equipment  on-site.  White  led  one  team  while  his  deputy,  Captain 
Wintersteen,  and  Sergeant  First  Class  Curtis  E.  Ingram,  USA,  led 
the  other  teams.  Sergeant  First  Class  Ingram,  Staff  Sergeant  Walter 
E.  Hare,  USA,  and  weapons  specialist  Mike  Holthus  identified  and 
documented  the  equipment  at  the  22nd  Central  Tank  Reserve 
Depot.  General  Parker  also  contributed  to  the  effort  to  identify 
and  count  equipment  and  record  serial  numbers.  Two  other  spe¬ 
cialists,  John  L.  Detch,  Jr.,  and  Kip  Melat,  handled  photography

duties,  while  Sergeant  First  Class  Kenneth  D.  Periman,  USA,  a 
linguist,  bridged  the  communications  gap. 


The  teams  inventoried  the  equipment  twice  and  confirmed 
their  figures  with  the  Russian  escorts  when  they  completed  a  facil¬ 
ity  or  group  of  equipment.  This  procedure  avoided  last-minute 
recounts  to  clear  up  discrepancies.  It  proved  to  be  a  timesaver 
because  the  U.S.  inventory  figures  did  not  match  those  in  the  pre¬ 
inspection  briefing.  The  U.S.  team  inventoried  254  T-54  tanks  and 
417  T-55  tanks,  which  varied  from  the  briefed  figures  of  361  and 
308,  respectively.  Russian  escorts  and  U.S.  inspectors  agreed  on  a 
combined  total  of  671  T-54s  and  T-55s  on-site.  Both  sides  agreed 
that  the  difference  of  two  in  total  tanks  was  an  accounting  mis¬ 
take,  while  the  difference  in  totals  for  the  two  types  of  tanks 
stemmed  from  the  difficulty  in  identifying  the  many  variants  of 
these  tanks.  The  ACV  and  ACV  look-alike  inventories  were  nearly 
error-free.  The  Russians  briefed  301  ACVs  on-site,  1  more  than

the  teams  found,  and  again  the  difference  was 
attributed  to  a  tabulating  error.  In  all,  the  Ameri¬ 
can  inspection  team  counted  and  recorded  1,315 
pieces  of  treaty  equipment.  The  inspection  ended 

22  hours  and  37  minutes  after  it  began,  with  the 
signing  and  exchanging  of  inspection  reports  by 
the  two  team  chiefs  on  July  20th,  at  0720  GMT. 

Team  White  notified  the  U.S.  Embassy  that 
the  inspection  was  complete  and  that  the  Russian 
escorts  had  arranged  for  transportation  to  the 
POE  within  20  minutes  after  completion  of  the 
inspection.  Team  White  departed  the  site  within 

23  hours  of  its  arrival  on-site.  That  night  the 
team  toured  Moscow,  enjoying  the  hospitality 
arranged  by  its  Russian  hosts.  The  next  morning, 
July  21st,  the  host  escorts  transported  Team 
White  to  Sheremetyevo  I  Airport,  where  the  team 
rendezvoused  with  the  American  C-141  aircrew 
and  left  Russia  at  1115  GMT.  Team  White  had 
completed  the  first  U.S.  CFE  inspection  and  left 
Russia  within  the  three-day  timeline  required  by 
the  NATO  deconfliction  schedule.10 

While  the  inspection  in  Russia  was  over,  the 
mission  was  far  from  finished.  The  C-141  flight 
back  to  Rhein-Main  was  a  working  trip  as  team 
members  reviewed  notes  taken  during  the  inspec¬ 
tion.  During  the  flight,  Captain  Wintersteen 
completed  the  CFE  mission  report  for  Lt.  Colo¬ 
nel  White’s  review.  White  would  submit  the 
report  within  an  hour  of  the  1430  GMT  touch¬ 
down  at  Rhein-Main.  Over  the  next  several  days,

pated  in  mission  debriefs.  They  labeled  the 
inspection  film  and  turned  it  in  for  develop¬ 
ment,  checked  and  repaired  equipment  as 
needed,  replaced  expendables,  and  returned 
issued  clothing.  Team  White  would  soon  pre¬ 
pare  for  its  next  CFE  inspection  mission,  sched¬ 
uled  for  August  4th  at  Shuya,  Russia.

The  declared  site  inspection  at  Buy,  Russia, 
was  significant  because  it  was  a  historical 
first — the  first  U.S.  inspection  under  the  CFE 
Treaty.  However,  the  inspection’s  significance 
was  not  only  historical.  The  Russian  equipment 
declared  at  Buy  in  the  initial  equipment  data 
exchange  of  February  1991  was  outdated  and 
differed  significantly  from  what  satellite  recon¬ 
naissance  indicated  in  July  1992.  Questions 
raised  by  NTM  could  only  be  answered  by  a 
team  on-site,  a  team  that  had  the  right  to  enter 
buildings  and  determine  their  contents;  inspect 
all  areas  on  the  site  that  could  hold  conven¬ 
tional  armaments  and  equipment  subject  to  the 
treaty  (CAEST);  and  take  a  detailed,  exact 
inventory  of  the  equipment.  The  openness  the  Russian  escorts  and 
local  site  officers  displayed  during  the  inspection  and  during  dis¬ 
cussions  explaining  the  increased  equipment  on-site  were  impor¬ 
tant  benchmarks  for  the  United  States  and  the  CFE  Treaty.  Team 
White  had  fulfilled  its  inspection  mission.  This  first  American  CFE 
inspection — well-prepared,  professional,  and  thorough — became 
the  norm  for  the  120-day  CFE  Treaty  baseline  phase  and  beyond.

First  U.S.  Escort  Mission 

U.S.  inspectors  had  completed  seven  missions  (nine  inspec¬ 
tions)  before  they  escorted  the  first  Eastern  inspection  team  on  a 
declared  site  inspection  of  U.S.  facilities.  On  August  10,  1992,  the 
Russian  government  sent  notices  of  intent  to  inspect  to  the  Ger¬ 
man,  Canadian,  and  U.S.  governments.11  The  Russians  intended  to 
inspect  U.S.  and  Canadian  forces  stationed  in  Germany.  Germany 
received  notice  because  it  was  the  host  nation  for  the  Russian 
inspection  mission,  and  as  such  would  be  responsible  for  the  POE 
procedures,  transportation,  and  other  support  for  the  Russian 
team  while  it  was  in  Germany.  On  August  13th,  treaty  representa¬ 
tives  of  the  three  nations  were  present  when  the  Russian  team 
arrived  at  Frankfurt. 

When  the  Aeroflot  AN-72  touched  down  at  Frankfurt  Inter¬ 
national  Airport,  the  Russian  inspection  team  disembarked  and

proceeded  to  the  VIP  lounge  where  the  POE  procedures  were 
conducted.  The  Russian  team  chief,  Colonel  Lev  Vladimirovich 
Patsiorin,  and  the  German  escort  team  chief,  Lt.  Colonel  Klaus 
Urban,  agreed  on  a  1000  GMT  arrival  time  for  the  inspection 
report.  The  U.S.  liaison  team — Major  Dee  Dodson  Morris,  USA, 
and  Staff  Sergeant  Kent  O.  Elliston,  USA — along  with  a  Canadian 
liaison  team,  participated  in  the  German  escort  team’s  inspection 
of  the  Russians’  treaty-authorized  equipment.  The  treaty  allowed 
each  inspected  nation  to  evaluate  the  inspection  team’s  equipment 
at  the  POE  or,  if  necessary,  at  the  inspection  site.  This  one-time 
group  inspection  of  the  Russian  team’s  equipment  facilitated  the 
inspection  process.  The  Russian  inspection  equipment  was  accept¬ 
able  as  outlined  in  the  Protocol  on  Inspection. 

The  Russian  team  declared  Canadian  Forces  Base  Lahr  as  its 
first  inspection  site.  Major  Morris  notified  European  Command 
(EUCOM)  and  OSIA  of  the  selection  and  then  proceeded  to  the 
site.  Major  Morris  did  not  attend  the  preinspection  briefing  be¬ 
cause  it  was  a  Canadian  military  facility,  and  the  Canadians  chose 
to  protect  their  national  sovereignty.  However,  she  remained  in  the 
Lahr  area  as  the  Russians  inspected,  in  case  any  U.S.  facilities  were 
encountered.  The  Canadians  billeted  all  inspectors  for  the  night  at 
Lahr.  The  next  morning  the  Russian  team  finished  its  inspection 
and  announced  the  sequential  inspection  site  before  signing  the 
inspection  report.

The  sequential  inspection  was  to  be  at  an  American  site,  the 
U.S.  Army  Airfield  at  Giebelstadt,  Germany.  Colonel  Patsiorin 
declared  the  first  sequential  inspection  site  at  1150  GMT;  10  min¬ 
utes  later,  Lt.  Colonel  Urban,  the  German  escort  team  chief,  noti¬ 
fied  Major  Morris  of  the  next  inspection.  Immediately,  she  notified 
Headquarters  EUCOM  of  the  sequential  declared  site  inspection 
and  then  alerted  the  operations  center  at  OSIA  European  Opera¬ 
tions.  Within  30  minutes  of  the  Russian  team’s  declaration,  Major 
George  P.  Weller,  USAF,  the  American  escort  team  chief  for  this 
mission,  received  word  of  the  inspection  site.  Ten  minutes  later  his 
10-member  American  escort  team  departed  Rhein-Main,  arriving 
at  Giebelstadt  at  1500  GMT. 

While  Team  Weller  drove  to  Giebelstadt,  Headquarters 
EUCOM  held  a  conference  call  with  USAREUR,  USAFE,  and 
Headquarters  OSIA  to  pass  on  the  status  of  the  inspection  and  to 
alert  Giebelstadt  to  prepare  for  the  upcoming  inspection.  Mean¬ 
while,  the  German  team  assumed  escort  responsibilities  from  the 
Canadians  as  the  Russians  left  the  Canadian  facilities  at  Lahr.12 
The  German  escorts  delivered  the  Russian  inspectors  to 
Giebelstadt  Army  Air  Field  at  1915  GMT,  seven  hours  and  15 
minutes  after  Colonel  Patsiorin  had  announced  the  site  for  this 
sequential  inspection.  Travel  time  to  Giebelstadt  was  well  within 
the  nine-hour  maximum,  but  long  enough  to  provide  six  hours  of 
preparation  time  at  the  Army  Air  Field.  Team  Weller  arrived  four 
hours  ahead  of  the  inspection  team.  The  U.S.  team  used  that  time 
for  its  own  site  familiarization  and  to  help  site  personnel  prepare 
for  the  CFE  inspection. 

Five  minutes  after  Colonel  Patsiorin’s  team  arrived,  site  offi¬ 
cials  presented  him  a  site  diagram.  Thirty  minutes  later,  he  de¬ 
clared  the  2nd  Squadron,  3d  Aviation  Regiment  as  the  OOV  for 
inspection.  At  this  time,  unit  personnel  presented  the  preinspection 
briefing,  which  ended  50  minutes  later,  2040  GMT.  One  point  of 
confusion  arose.  The  data  presented  in  the  briefing  were  dated 
August  14,  1992.  The  Russian  team  had  deployed  before  the  most 
recent  data  exchange  and  consequently  held  data  from  the  previ¬ 
ous  exchange.  Colonel  Patsiorin  accepted  the  new  information, 
and  he  and  his  team  retired  for  the  evening. 

The  next  morning,  August  15th,  at  0715  GMT,  the  Russian 
inspectors  began  the  inspection.  Site  officials  had  briefed  them  that 
there  were  14  AH-64  “Apache”  attack  helicopters,  11  OH-58 
“Kiowa”  multipurpose  attack  helicopters,  and  3  UH-60 
“Blackhawk”  helicopters  on  site.  There  were  differences  between 
the  reported  and  briefed  numbers,  and  the  reasons  for  those  differ¬ 
ences  were  explained  to  Colonel  Patsiorin’s  satisfaction.  At  2100 
GMT  Colonel  Patsiorin  officially  announced  the  sequential  site, 
the  U.S.  Army’s  garrison  at  Schweinfurt,  Germany.  At  2130  GMT 
Patsiorin  completed  his  inspection  report  and  both  he  and  Weller 
signed  the  report.1 '

When  the  Russian  inspection  team  left  Giebelstadt  Army 
Airfield  at  2145  GMT,  the  Germans  again  assumed  escort  respon¬ 
sibilities.  The  Russian  and  German  team  chiefs  agreed  to  follow 
the  spirit  of  the  treaty,  not  the  letter  of  the  law,  and  exceed  the 
nine-hour  travel  time  limit  to  the  next  site,  allowing  the  inspection 
team  to  take  advantage  of  a  comfortable  hotel  in  the  vicinity  of 
Giebelstadt  for  the  night.  The  following  morning  the  inspection 
team  arrived  at  Schweinfurt  at  0720  GMT.  There,  the  Germans 
relinquished  responsibility  for  the  Russian  team  to  the  U.S.  escorts 
for  the  inspection  of  the  U.S.  Army’s  Conn  Barracks  facilities  at 
Schweinfurt,  home  of  the  1st  Brigade,  3rd  Infantry  Division. 

Following  the  inspection  of  Conn  Barracks,  the  Russian 
inspection  team  continued  through  three  more  CFE  inspections:  at 
the  Grafenwoehr  Training  Area,  3rd  Brigade,  3rd  Infantry  Divi¬ 
sion;  at  Mainz,  the  Mainz  Army  Depot;  and  finally  at  Baben- 
hausen,  the  41st  Field  Artillery  Brigade.  The  Russians  had  not 
planned  to  conduct  the  Grafenwoehr  inspection,  but  all  the  tanks 
and  most  of  the  ACVs  normally  in  place  at  Conn  Barracks  in 
Schweinfurt  were  not  on-site;  the  American  units  had  deployed  to 
the  training  areas  at  Grafenwoehr.  As  a  result,  the  Russian  inspec¬ 
tion  at  Schweinfurt  was  brief,  since  there  was  little  equipment 
there.  Because  the  deployed  equipment  represented  over  15  per¬ 
cent  of  the  declared  equipment  for  Conn  Barracks,  the  Russians 
exercised  their  treaty  right  to  declare  a  sequential  inspection  to  the 
location  where  the  equipment  was  in  place:  the  Grafenwoehr 
Training  Area.  Team  Weller,  OSIA’s  escort  team,  stayed  with  the 
Russian  inspection  team  through  the  first  three  inspections.  Colo¬ 
nel  Lawrence  G.  Kelley,  OSIA  European  Operations  Command’s 
Chief  of  Operations,  chose  to  have  Major  Keith  A.  Oatman,  USA, 
and  his  team  relieve  Team  Weller  enroute  to  the  Mainz  Army 
Depot.  Kelley  did  this  to  mitigate  fatigue  and  to  allow  Weller’s 
team  time  to  prepare  for  an  upcoming  inspection  mission.  Colonel 
Kelley  also  wanted  to  spread  the  escort  experience  among  all  of 
the  teams.14  Major  Morris  and  Staff  Sergeant  Elliston  remained  as 
the  liaison  team  throughout  the  nine-day  inspection  trip,  assisting

the  American  escort  teams  and  USAREUR  site  officials  as  neces¬ 
sary.  At  Grafenwoehr,  a  very  large  Army  training  facility,  Major 
Morris  also  assisted  in  escorting  the  Russian  team.  This  concluded 
the  first  series  of  Russian  CFE  inspections  at  American  facilities. 
Colonel  Patsiorin’s  team  departed  Frankfurt  for  Moscow  at  0914 
GMT  on  August  22,  1992. 

The  Russian  team  did  not  declare  ambiguities  during  the  in¬ 
spections  of  the  five  U.S.  declared  sites.  There  were  instances  in 
which  the  briefed  and  the  observed  equipment  totals  differed,  but 
U.S.  escorts  and  site  representatives  fully  explained  those  differences 
to  the  inspectors,  who  annotated  them  in  the  inspection  reports.15 


First  U.S.  Liaison  Mission 

The  first  U.S.  liaison  activity  during  baseline  occurred  in 
England  on  July  20,  1992,  just  three  days  after  entry  into  force. 
Captain  Ellen  Merkle,  USAF,  and  Petty  Officer  First  Class  (POl) 
David  E.  Sparks,  USN,  were  the  liaison  team  that  met  the  British 
escort  team  chief,  RAF  Wing  Commander  Griffiths  and  his  nine- 
person  team  at  the  POE,  RAF  Scampton.  The  Russian  inspection 
team  arrived  on  July  20th  at  1730  GMT  and  declared  a  challenge 
inspection  near  Catterick  Garrison  at  Richmond;  the  team  contin¬ 
ued  with  sequential  declared  site  inspections  at  Roman  Barracks  at 
Colchester,  Meany  Barracks  at  Colchester,  and  finally  Carver 
Barracks  at  Wimbish.  The  Russians  were  in  England  for  seven 
days  during  this  four-site  inspection  trip.  The  inspection  team  did 
not  come  upon  any  U.S.  facilities  on  these  British  Army  installa¬ 
tions,  so  it  was  a  quiet  mission  for  the  American  liaison  team. 
Captain  Merkle  and  POl  Sparks  stayed  in  contact  with  the  British 
escort  team  from  the  time  the  Russian  team  arrived  in  country 
through  its  departure.  They  then  returned  to  their  staging  area,  the 
East  Gate  Hotel  in  Lincoln,  to  wait  for  the  next  mission.16

“Backdoor”  Communications 

Formal  communications  proved  to  be  a  problem  during  this 
first  liaison  mission  and  continued  to  be  a  source  of  concern 
throughout  baseline.  An  informal  communications  system  devel¬ 
oped  among  the  Allies  that  enabled  them  to  complete  their  mis¬ 
sions.  As  an  example,  Russia  notified  the  United  Kingdom  that  a 
Russian  inspection  team  intended  to  arrive  in  the  United  Kingdom 
on  the  evening  of  July  20,  1992,  to  conduct  one  challenge  and 
three  declared  site  inspections  during  a  CFE  mission  in  England. 
Russia  satisfied  its  treaty  notification  responsibilities  with  the 
single  message  to  the  United  Kingdom  because  it  intended  to  in¬ 
spect  only  English  sites.  Diplomatic  channels,  however,  failed  to 
carry  out  the  treaty  requirement  to  notify  allies  within  a  group  of 
states  when  a  state  received  a  notification  of  intent  to  inspect.  The 
United  States  would  have  been  unaware  of  the  impending  inspec¬ 
tion  had  it  not  been  for  the  informal,  “backdoor,”  communica¬ 
tions  system. 

This  system  operated  as  an  informal  network  among  the  arms 
control  verification  organizations  throughout  Europe.  It  developed 
during  the  coordination  of  mock  inspections,  grew  as  entry  into 
force  approached,  and  matured  during  baseline  when  the  various 
inspection  organizations  came  to  rely  on  it.  For  the  United  States, 
assigning  personnel  with  linguistic  skills  to  OSIA’s  European  Op¬ 
erations  was  a  key  to  the  development  of  the  communications 
network.  Colonel  Kelley  looked  not  only  for  Russian-speaking 
inspectors  but  also  for  personnel  conversant  in  the  six  CFE  lan-

guages  when  filling  assignments.  For  instance,  Captain  William  C. 
Plumlee,  USA,  and  Major  John  D.  Monahan,  USA,  were  combat 
arms  officers  and  West  European  FAOs.  Their  language  skills 
proved  invaluable  as  they  directed  the  Command’s  Operation 
Center  in  communicating  with  the  European  verification  agencies. 
It  was  these  skills  that  enabled  OSIA  personnel  to  establish  profes¬ 
sional  and  personal  relationships  with  their  counterparts  through¬ 
out  Europe. 

The  Plans  Branch  provided  ample  opportunity  for  U.S.  per¬ 
sonnel  to  exercise  their  language  capabilities  and  to  communicate 
effectively  with  U.S.  allies.  Master  Sergeant  William  N.  Chesney, 
Jr.,  USA,  and  Technical  Sergeant  Ronald  S.  Fox,  USAF,  of  OSIA 
European  Operations  Command’s  Plans  Branch,  both  spoke  Ger¬ 
man;  Chesney  also  spoke  French  and  dabbled  in  several  other 
languages.  They  frequently  spoke  with  the  Zentrum  fur 
Verifikationsaufgaben  der  Bundeswehr  (ZVBW)  officials  during 
preparations  for  mock  inspections,  and  whenever  possible,  they 
spoke  German.  They  coordinated  with  the  ZVBW  not  only  U.S./ 
German  mocks  but  also  U.S.  mocks  with  other  nations  at  U.S. 
facilities  in  Germany.  The  United  States  respected  German  sover¬ 
eignty  when  inviting  other  states  to  visit  U.S.  facilities,  and  Ger¬ 
many  took  every  opportunity  to  exercise  its  role  as  host  nation  for 
these  inspections.  These  planners  helped  OSIA  develop  a  working 
relationship  with  the  busiest  of  the  NATO  verification  agencies  in 
implementating  the  CFE  Treaty.  Whenever  possible,  OSIA’s  Euro¬ 
pean  Operations  Command  communicated  with  its  counterparts 
in  their  language.  As  the  number  of  mocks  increased  and  baseline 
drew  near,  communications  among  the  agencies  increased;  people 
working  in  the  verification  agencies  grew  increasingly  confident  in 
each  other.17 

When  baseline  began  it  soon  became  apparent  that  the  formal 
treaty  notification  system  would  not  be  100  percent  reliable.  Most 
verification  agencies  did  not  transmit  the  official  notifications  to 
other  states — other  agencies  within  their  governments  were  re¬ 
sponsible  for  these  formal  notifications.  The  verification  agencies, 
however,  relied  on  accurate  and  timely  information  to  properly 
implement  the  treaty.  The  “Group  of  Four” — the  French,  English, 
German,  and  American  verification  agencies — called  each  other  daily 
and  faxed  situation  reports  to  each  other.  In  the  first  U.S.  liaison 
mission,  discussed  above,  the  United  States  received  notification  of 
the  Russian  inspection  only  because  the  Joint  Arms  Control  Imple¬ 
mentation  Group  (JACIG),  the  United  Kingdom’s  verification 
agency,  faxed  a  copy  of  the  notification  to  OSIA’s  European  Op¬ 
erations  Command  on  August  18th,  two  days  before  Russian  CFE 
inspectors  would  arrive  in  England.  This  gave  the  American 
inspectorate  sufficient  time  to  notify  one  of  the  two  OSIA  liaison 
teams  prepositioned  in  England  and  to  notify  Headquarters 
EUCOM  of  the  impending  inspection.18

CFE  Treaty  Baseline 


Lt.  Colonel  Thomas  C.  Fiser,  U.S.  Army 

Lt.  Colonel  Thomas  C.  Fiser,  U.S.  Army,  was  one  of 
the  original  American  CFE  team  chiefs  during  the 
baseline  and  reduction  phases  of  treaty  implementa¬ 
tion.  He  holds  a  master's  degree  in  Russian  area 
studies.  An  armor  officer  (tanks)  and  a  foreign  area 
officer  (Russian),  Lt.  Colonel  Fiser  served  with  the 
1st  Cavalry  Division  in  the  Gulf  War  prior  to  re¬ 
porting  to  OSIA  European  Operations  in  Frankfurt, 
Germany. 

On  preparing  the  team  for  its  inspection  mission: 

“The  first  thing  I  always  do  is  give  my  operations 
order.  This  is  pretty  much  a  standard,  five  para¬ 
graph,  U.S.  Army  operations  order:  situation,  mis¬ 
sion,  execution,  administration/logistics,  and  com¬ 
mand,  control,  communication,  coordination.  I  lay 
out  all  the  deployment  information  so  everybody 
knows  where  we’re  going,  when  we’re  going,  what 
we’re  going  to  do  when  we  get  there,  and  how  we’re 
going  to  do  it.  They  know  who  is  on  what  subteam, 
when  we  break  down  into  two-  or  three-person 
subteams,  who  carries  what  equipment,  and  any 
specific  instructions  covering  a  myriad  of  issues,  like 
drinking  water  or  specific  team  equipment.  It  also 
covers  individual  tasks  like  who  does  the  voice 
format  reports  to  the  embassy  or  who’s  responsible 
for  laying  on  transportation. 

“Following  the  operations  order,  we  have  a 
period  of  training  on  all  the  inspection  equipment. 

The  only  thing  that  presented  a  challenge  for  any¬ 
body  was  our  photographic  equipment,  the  video 
or  35mm  cameras,  and  the  dictaphone.  Those  are 
really  the  only  pieces  of  equipment  that  required 
any  training.  We’d  also  have  training,  usually  two 
or  three  hours,  on  the  signature  piece  of  equipment 
that  we  expected  to  see  at  that  particular  type  of 
unit,  so  everyone  was  well  versed  in  what  we  were 
going  to  be  seeing,  whether  it  be  ground  or  air 
equipment.” 

On  use  of  CFE  Treaty's  database:  “The  point  of 
departure  was  always  the  submitted  data:  Charts 
one,  three,  and  five  data,  and  their  submission 
photos.  We’d  usually  expand  on  that  quite  a  bit.  I’d 
assign  my  weapons  specialist  the  job  of  presenting 
classes  on  the  declared  TLE  and  other  types  of 
vehicles,  equipment  that  we  expected  to  see  in  the 
unit,  be  it  a  motorized  rifle  regiment  or  an  air  regi¬ 
ment.  We  studied  both  order  of  battle  and  equip¬ 
ment  types  and  we’d  expand  our  study  from  there.” 


On  CFE  team  chiefs 
and  inspectors  serving 
as  soldier-diplomats: 

“That  is  a  very  impor¬ 
tant  aspect  of  being  a 
treaty  inspector.  It  was 
something  I  wasn’t 
really  prepared  for  until 
I  arrived  here.  First,  I 
did  some  mock  inspec¬ 
tions,  and  then  had  one 
or  two  real  CFE  Treaty 
inspections  under  my  belt.  I  found,  especially  in  the 
Eastern  bloc  nations,  that  at  meals,  and  often  at  the 
report-signing  ceremony,  you  would  be  expected  to 
make  some  sort  of  toast.  You’re  expected  to  speak, 
to  some  extent,  about  the  opening  of  relations 
between  our  countries,  and  on  how  the  CFE  Treaty 
was  bringing  us  closer  together.  There  were  varia¬ 
tions  on  that  theme,  but  you  are  almost  invariably 
expected  to  say  something  along  those  lines.  That 
was  a  new  experience  in  my  career.  There  is  defi¬ 
nitely  a  diplomatic  side  to  being  an  inspector.” 

On  the  differences  between  being  an  inspector  and 
an  escort:  “I  have  to  be  careful  here.  The  main 
thing  that  makes  being  an  escort  more  difficult  is 
that  you  are  defensive  as  opposed  to  being  on  the 
offense.  You  have  to  react  to  the  inspector.  The 
treaty  requires  that  you  aid  him  whenever  necessary 
in  carrying  out  his  inspection.  At  the  same  time, 
obviously,  we  have  U.S.  interests  that  we  are  trying 
to  protect.  So  there’s  a  fine  line  you  have  to  walk. 
There  have  been  times  when  we  have  had  disagree¬ 
ments  concerning  the  interpretation  of  certain 
treaty  points  with  representatives  from  different 
U.S.  military  headquarters  here  in  Europe.  We’ve 
also  had  confrontations  or  issues  arise  with  the 
inspectors  from  various  countries  at  U.S.  sites.  That 
makes  escorting  more  difficult.  Another  aspect  of 
escorting  is  the  logistics.  They  are  much  more 
difficult  during  the  escort  mission  because  you’re 
also  dealing  with  the  host  nation  escorts.  You  are 
trying  to  make  lodging  arrangements,  many  times 
off  post,  for  20  to  25  people,  sometimes  as  many  as 
28  or  29  people.  Going  from  site  to  site,  there  is  an 
extreme  amount  of  coordination  that  has  to  be 
done.  It  makes  for  a  very  difficult  time,  and  some 
very,  very  long  nights.  I’ve  had  some  escort  missions 
where  if  you  got  a  couple  of  hours  sleep  a  night  you 
were  doing  well.”

U.S.  Baseline  Inspection  Operations 

The  U.S.  inspection  teams  conducted  44  baseline  inspections 
at  Eastern  sites.  Because  of  civil  unrest  in  Georgia,  the  U.S.  govern¬ 
ment  canceled  one  mission  out  of  concern  for  the  safety  of  its 
inspectors.  Teams  deployed  to  nine  different  countries,  inspecting 
Russia  most  frequently.  Of  the  44  inspections,  only  one  was  a 
challenge  inspection,  conducted  in  Belarus;  the  other  43  U.S.  in¬ 
spections  were  declared  site  inspections.  In  total,  the  United  States 
conducted  22  CFE  single  inspection  missions  and  1 1  missions 
during  which  teams  inspected  two  sites.  Unlike  their  Eastern  coun¬ 
terparts,  U.S.  teams  inspected  only  one  or  two  sites  per  mission, 
never  approaching  the  10-day  in-country  allowance  outlined  in  the 
treaty. 

The  U.S.  pattern  of  inspection  operations  was  influenced  by 
the  NATO  deconfliction  schedule.  The  schedule  allocated  each 
NATO  state  three-day  inspection  periods,  or  “slots,”  in  which  to 
conduct  CFE  inspections.  The  three-day  slot  restricted  a  team’s 
ability  to  conduct  sequential  inspections.  The  treaty  allowed  84 
hours  to  conduct  two  declared  site  inspections,  48  hours  for  the 
first  and  36  hours  for  each  sequential  inspection.  The  NATO  slot 
allowed  only  72  hours;  the  team  lost  12  hours  when  squeezing  two 
inspections  into  the  same  slot.  In  the  later  stages  of  baseline,  the 
slots  were  sometimes  consecutive,  allowing  a  team  six  days  in 
country  to  complete  its  mission.  By  contrast,  the  Russian  CFE 
teams  adopted  a  less  costly  approach  by  inspecting  10  U.S.  sites 
during  two  inspection  missions.  The  cost  of  supporting  and  trans¬ 
porting  an  inspection  team  was  borne  by  the  inspected  state,  while 
the  inspecting  state  paid  its  way  to  and  from  the  inspected  state.

Escorts  could  deny  access  to 
aircraft  shelters,  but  inspectors 
could  require  that  TLE  be  brought 
out  of  the  shelter. 


Two  trips  instead  of  five  or  six  produced  a  significant  savings  for 
the  inspecting  state.19 

Inspections  were  extremely  intrusive,  and  U.S.  inspectors 
were  trained  to  probe  and  push  as  deeply  as  possible  when  inspect¬ 
ing.  An  inspection  team  had  significant  rights  when  conducting  an 
inspection;  however,  the  treaty  also  stipulated  limits  that  protected 
the  inspected  state.  The  treaty  authorized  an  inspection  team  to 
inspect  all  areas  within  a  declared  site  except  those  that  belonged 
exclusively  to  another  OOV.  In  addition,  inspectors  had  the  same 
rights  at  locations  separated  from  the  site  where  CAEST  of  the 
inspected  unit  were  routinely  present,  such  as  a  railhead.  This 
meant,  among  other  things,  that  the  inspection  team  had  the  right 
to  access,  entry,  and  unobstructed  inspection  of  any  location, 
structure,  or  area  within  a  structure  in  which  CAEST  were  perma¬ 
nently  or  routinely  present. 

Escorts,  however,  could  apply  treaty  restrictions  on  an  inspec¬ 
tion  team  to  limit  access  to  or  within  a  structure  in  several  ways. 
The  first  and  most  common  way  was  by  citing  the  two-meter  rule. 
An  escort  could  deny  an  inspector  access  through  any  entrance 
that  was  less  than  two  meters  wide  because  that  was  the  threshold 
through  which  no  CAEST  could  fit.  Having  passed  through  an 
entrance  greater  than  two  meters  wide,  the  team  could  continue  its 
inspection  within  the  facility  until  it  reached  a  point  where  escorts 
could  successfully  apply  the  two-meter  rule.  A  second  limitation 
was  the  right  to  shroud  sensitive  equipment  and  deny  inspectors 
access  to  any  shrouded  item  or  container,  so  long  as  any  one  of  its 
measurements  fell  under  two  meters.  Third,  escorts  could  also 
deny  inspectors  access  to  hardened  aircraft  shelters.  While  an 
escort  team  could  normally  prevent  an  inspection  team  from  enter¬ 
ing  a  hardened  aircraft  shelter,  inspectors  had  the  right  to  look  in 
to  determine  if  any  CAEST  were  present.  Further,  if  CAEST  were

Armaments  and 
Equipment

Treaty 

positioned  in  an  aircraft  shelter  and  the  inspectors  were  denied 
entry,  they  had  the  right  to  counterdemand  that  all  treaty-limited 
equipment  (TLE)  be  brought  out  for  display  to  determine  quanti¬ 
ties,  types,  and  models. 

Finally,  escorts  could  deny,  limit,  or  delay  access  to  those 
areas  or  shrouded  equipment  that  the  inspected  state’s  government 
considered  sensitive.  Sensitive  areas  could  hold  equipment  that  the 
inspected  state  considered  critical  to  national  security,  such  as  a 
communications  center  or  a  special  weapons  storage  facility.  But 
not  all  sensitive  areas  dealt  with  national  security;  prisons,  for 
example,  were  frequently  declared  sensitive  areas.  If  an  escort 
team  chief  declared  an  area  or  object  sensitive,  he  then  needed  to 
state  whether  there  were  any  CAEST  in  the  area.  If  CAEST  were 
present,  the  escort  team  was  required  to  report  the  amount,  type, 
and  model  and  to  take  steps  to  satisfy  inspectors  that  no  addi¬ 
tional  equipment  was  present. 

As  with  access  to  facilities,  the  treaty  allowed  the  inspected 
state  to  impose  limits  on  inspectors’  access  to  CAEST.  The  Proto¬ 
col  on  Inspection  limited  inspectors’  access  to  the  extent  they 
could  confirm  visually  the  number,  type,  and  model  or  version  of  a 
piece  of  CAEST.  If  inspectors  encountered  recategorized  helicop¬ 
ters,  reclassified  aircraft,  armored  vehicle  look-alikes,  or  reduced 
equipment,  specific  inspection  protocol  procedures  allowed  inspec¬ 
tion  of  the  interior  of  these  vehicles  to  confirm  the  status  of  the 
equipment.  Inspectors  could  require  that  the  doors  of  an  armored 
vehicle  look-alike  be  opened  to  confirm  that  the  vehicle  could  not 
transport  a  combat  infantry  squad.  Equipment  within  or  on  such  a 
vehicle  could  be  shrouded,  and  the  inspectors  had  no  right  to  enter 
the  vehicle. 

Declared  Site  Access 

During  baseline,  declared  site  access  became  the  most  conten¬ 
tious  issue  that  U.S.  inspectors  faced  during  inspections  of  Eastern 
states.  As  baseline  began,  the  U.S.  understanding  of  access  on 
a  declared  site  had  not  changed  since  American  Ambassador 

Lynn  Hansen  and  the  Soviet  verification  negotiator,  Gennadiy 
Yeftaviyev,  ironed  out  an  agreement  in  November  1990.  During  a 
declared  site  inspection,  a  team  could  select  and  inspect  only  one 
OOV  on  a  declared  site — the  OOV  was  the  subject  of  the  inspec¬ 
tion.  The  team,  however,  could  inspect  the  entire  declared  site,  to 
its  outermost  natural  or  manmade  borders,  to  include  areas  com¬ 
mon  to  all  OOVs  located  on  the  site.  Inspectors  were  prohibited 
only  from  any  area  on  the  declared  site  that  supported  another 
OOV  exclusively. 

The  first  indication  of  a  different  understanding  of  inspector 
access  during  a  declared  site  inspection  arose  during  the  U.S./

1992.  During  the  Russian  preinspection  briefing  at  Pushkin,  es¬ 
corts  presented  a  site  diagram  that  depicted  only  the  two  OOVs  at 
Pushkin  and  a  limited  portion  of  the  common  areas.  Lt.  Colonel 
Edward  Gallagher,  the  U.S.  team  chief,  pointed  out  that  U.S.  sat¬ 
ellite  reconnaissance  indicated  that  there  were  other  inspectable 
areas  within  the  outermost  boundary  of  the  garrison.  The  Russian 
escorts  responded  that  the  Pushkin  site  diagram  was  correct.  This 
problem  was  noted  in  the  mock  inspection  report;  the  Russians 
countered  that  U.S.  inspectors  had  been  given  access  to  the  entire 
declared  site  associated  with  the  OOV.20

When  the  treaty  entered  into  force,  it  became  obvious  that 
some  states  were  not  using  the  declared  site  definition  that  had 
been  negotiated.  On  August  5,  1992,  during  an  early  baseline 
inspection  of  the  228th  High  Power  Artillery  Brigade  at  Shuya, 
Russia,  Lt.  Colonel  White  received  a  site  diagram  that  illustrated 
the  OOV  but  not  all  of  the  common  areas  on  the  site.  Escort  offi¬ 
cials  subsequently  denied  the  team  access  to  the  common  areas  not 
included  on  the  diagram.  Nine  days  later,  when  all  states  again 
exchanged  treaty  data,  it  became  apparent  that  Lt.  Colonel 
White’s  experience  would  not  be  an  isolated  one.  The  original 
Soviet  site  diagrams  had  displayed  multiple  OOVs  and  common 
areas  on  a  single  site.  The  new  August  14th  diagrams  indicated 
one  OOV  on  one  declared  site  that  was  defined  by  the  boundaries 
of  that  OOV.21  The  sites  were  no  different  physically — the  com¬ 
mon  areas  remained — but  some  states  had  changed  their  concept 
of  a  declared  site.

On  August  29,  1992,  U.S.  inspectors  had  their  first  opportu¬ 
nity  to  confirm,  on-site,  that  the  new  diagrams  reflected  changes  in 
the  concept  of  a  declared  site.  In  addition,  inspectors  would  deter¬ 
mine  how  these  changes  affected  inspector  access  during  an  inspec¬ 
tion.  Colonel  Joseph  J.  Drach,  Jr.,  USA,  led  an  inspection  of  the 
336th  Rocket  Artillery  Brigade  in  Osipovichi,  Belarus.  Drach 
received  a  site  diagram  from  the  Belarussian  escorts  that  did  not 
include  all  common  areas  within  the  manmade  boundaries  of  the 
site.  More  important,  the  escort  team  denied  the  inspectors  access 
to  common  areas  that  were  on  the  installation  but  excluded  from 
the  site  diagram.  While  Drach  documented  this  fact  as  an  ambigu¬ 
ity  in  his  inspection  report,  another  U.S.  team  was  preparing  to 
deploy  to  Russia.22 

Four  days  later,  on  September  4,  1992,  Lt.  Colonel  Jan  S. 
Karcz,  USA,  led  his  team  to  the  752nd  Guards  Motorized  Rifle 
Regiment  at  Novyy,  Russia,  to  test  the  Russian  definition  of  a 
declared  site.  His  mission  was  to  draw  a  “line  in  the  sand”  on  the 
issue  of  the  definition  of  a  declared  site  and  inspector  access.  In 
preparing  his  team  to  confront  those  issues,  Karcz  worked  closely 
with  Colonel  Schuyler  (Sky)  Foerster,  USAF,  who  had  participated 
in  the  negotiation  process  in  Vienna  and  was  knowledgeable  of  the 
negotiators’  intentions  on  the  issue  of  declared  sites  and  access. 
Karcz  and  Foerster  worked  with  team  linguist  Sergeant  Danny  K. 
Boyd,  USAF,  and  Alan  J.  French,  Russian  language  professional,  to 
prepare  treaty-based  responses  to  questions  that  might  arise  during 
the  inspection.  When  the  team  deployed  to  Moscow,  Russia’s  only 
POE,  they  brought  along  five  to  six  pages  of  Russian  text  to  con- 


179 


CFE  Treaty  Baseline 


vey  the  U.S.  position  on  declared  sites  and  access  in  language  that 
would  be  unambiguous  to  an  escort  team  chief. 

On  arrival  at  Novyy,  Lt.  Colonel  Karcz  received  a  site  dia¬ 
gram  of  the  OOV  that  was  limited  specifically  to  the  area  taken  up 
by  the  OOV.  It  did  not  include  common  areas  outside  the  OOV  on 
the  installation.  The  Russians  defined  the  site’s  boundary  using 
roads  that  were  well  within  the  fenced  area  that  was  military 
property  at  Novyy.  At  that  point  Lt.  Colonel  Karcz  cited  Article 
XV  of  the  treaty  that  allowed  the  use  of  NTM  and  produced  a 
map  developed  from  overhead  photography.  Karcz  pointed  out  to 
Colonel  V.  Pavlenko,  the  Russian  escort  team  chief,  what  the  U.S. 
considered  the  outermost  boundary  of  the  site.  After  two  to  three 
hours  of  discussion,  Colonel  Pavlenko  left  the  briefing  area  to 
notify  Moscow  of  the  U.S.  position.  He  soon  returned  and  would 
not  stray  from  the  Russian  definition  of  a  declared  site.  He  reiter¬ 
ated  that  the  Russian  site  diagram  was  accurate  as  drawn  and  that 
the  U.S.  team  would  have  access  only  to  the  area  depicted  on  the 
diagram.  At  this  point  Lt.  Colonel  Karcz  recognized  that  Colonel 
Pavlenko  was  at  his  final  position  and  would  not  budge.  Karcz 
commenced  the  inspection. 

As  the  inspection  proceeded,  Pavlenko  adhered  to  the  Russian 
definition  of  the  declared  site  and  did  not  allow  the  Americans 
access  to  all  areas  that  the  U.S.  team  considered  common  areas. 
This  prompted  Karcz  to  declare  an  ambiguity.  Pavlenko  protested 
that  an  ambiguity  was  not  appropriate  in  this  situation  because  the 
issue  did  not  address  TLE  nor  was  it  based  on  objective  facts. 
Karcz  countered  that  the  declared  site  definition  and  access  issues 
were  indeed  based  on  objective  facts:  the  negotiating  history  pro¬ 
vided  a  very  specific  definition  of  a  declared  site  and  the  access  to 
be  granted  to  an  inspection  team  at  a  declared  site.  The  current 
Russian  approach  did  not  follow  that  specific  definition  and  did 
not  satisfy  CFE  Treaty  requirements,  thus  the  ambiguity.  Karcz 
reminded  Pavlenko  that,  ultimately,  inspectors  write  the  reports.

The  inspecting  team  chief  had  the  right  to  determine  if  an  ambigu¬ 
ity  was  to  be  written,  just  as  the  escort  team  chief  determined  what 
response,  if  any,  would  be  made  on  the  report.2’ 

This  new  interpretation  of  a  declared  site  spawned  several 
other  problems  that  surfaced  repeatedly  during  baseline  inspec¬ 
tions.  The  first  problem  inspectors  faced  on-site  was  the  site  dia¬ 
gram.  The  new  diagrams  illustrated  that  the  declared  site  was 
defined  solely  by  the  OOV — each  OOV  was  a  declared  site.  In 
addition,  states  depicted  OOVs  bounded  by  internal  roads,  build¬ 
ings,  and  fences  specific  to  the  OOV,  not  by  the  outermost  bound¬ 
aries  of  an  installation.  These  site  diagrams  omitted  common  areas 
located  within  an  installation  that  were  outside  the  narrowly  de¬ 
fined  OOV.  Escort  teams,  armed  with  these  site  diagrams,  allowed 
teams  to  inspect  only  the  OOV,  which  had  become  synonymous 
with  the  declared  site,  thus  limiting  access  to  all  common  areas. 

The  new  declared  site  interpretation  also  affected  the  requirement 
under  CFE  1A  to  report  organizations  and  personnel  figures  for 
activities  subject  to  inspection  at  the  inspection  site.  Escorts  did 
not  provide  figures  for  units  located  in  what  had  previously  been 
common  areas.  Another  difficulty  arose  at  the  POE,  before  the 
start  of  the  inspection.  Inspection  teams  were,  de  facto,  required  to 
announce  the  OOV  to  be  inspected  while  at  the  POE,  because 
OOVs  were  now  located  on  their  own  individual  declared  sites.  By 
declaring  the  site  for  inspection,  inspectors  were  also  revealing  the 
OOV  for  inspection.  This  fact  increased  preparation  time  from 
one  hour  when  inspectors  selected  the  OOV  at  the  site  to  more 
than  six  to  nine  hours  when  inspectors  were  forced  to  select  the 
OOV  at  the  point  of  entry. 

The  declared  site  issue  arose  repeatedly  during  baseline,  caus¬ 
ing  U.S.  inspectors  to  declare  eight  ambiguities.  These  ambiguities 
occurred  when  escorts  denied  inspectors  access  to  all  common 
areas.  There  were  also  occasions  when  states  produced  site  dia¬ 
grams  that  omitted  all  common  areas,  but  escorts  nonetheless 
allowed  access  to  all  common  areas.24  The  repeated  efforts  of  U.S. 
and  allied  inspection  teams  led  to  discussions  at  the  Joint  Consul¬ 
tative  Group  (JCG)  in  Vienna  to  resolve  the  situation. 

U.S.  Ambassador  Lynn  M.  Hansen  addressed  the  declared  site 
issue  at  the  opening  meeting  of  the  JCG  on  September  23,  1992. 

He  discussed  the  site  definition  and  access  problems  that  Team 
Karcz  had  encountered  at  Novyy  and  that  other  American  and 
NATO  inspectors  had  encountered  elsewhere.  Citing  the  August 
14,  1992,  exchange  of  information,  Ambassador  Hansen  stated 
that  the  Russian  definition  of  a  declared  site  was  now  radically 
different  than  that  negotiated  in  New  York  in  late  October  1990. 
The  new  Russian  data  indicated  that  all  multiple  OOV  sites  had 
been  converted  to  multiple  declared  sites  within  a  single  installa¬ 
tion.  He  highlighted  one  example  in  which  the  left  side  of  a  dormi¬ 
tory  was  within  the  declared  site  of  one  OOV  while  the  right  side 


181 


CFE  Treaty  Baseline 


was  in  a  different  declared  site.  Hansen  expressed  concern  as  to 
how  this  Russian  approach  might  affect  verification  of  treaty 
compliance. 

Ambassador  Hansen  further  pointed  out  that  the  new  Rus¬ 
sian  approach  in  effect  forced  a  CFE  inspection  team  to  declare  the 
specific  OOV  at  the  POE.  This  gave  the  inspected  party  an  oppor¬ 
tunity  to  move  equipment  across  a  road  and  hide  it  in  a  different 
OOV  during  the  inspection  team’s  nine-hour  transit  from  the  POE. 
At  a  declared  site  with  a  single  OOV  there  was  nowhere  to  hide 
the  equipment  because  all  areas  were  subject  to  inspection.  At  the 
multiple  OOV/declared  site  installations  the  inspection  process 
could  become  a  pea  in  the  shell  game.  This  Russian  change, 

Hansen  charged,  directly  threatened  the  openness  that  was  a  key 
component  in  the  treaty.  Inspection  teams  could  no  longer  visit  a 
site  and  be  confident  that  they  had  seen  all  of  the  equipment  there. 
Further  negotiations  in  Vienna  led  the  Russians  to  agree  with  the 
U.S.  position  and  to  provide  assurances  that  they  would  change 
their  site  diagrams.25  After  receiving  assurances  of  change,  NATO 
allies  tested  the  Russians  again. 

On  October  3,  1992,  10  days  after  Ambassador  Hansen’s 
speech  and  on  the  heels  of  a  German  inspection  team,  Team 
Gessert  deployed  to  the  Russian  423rd  Guards  Motorized  Rifle 
Regiment  at  Naro-Fominsk.  During  that  inspection,  the  issues  of

escorts  at  Naro-Fominsk.

On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


site  diagrams  and  multiple  declared  sites  on  an  installation  sur¬ 
faced  again  because  the  changes  had  not  penetrated  through  from 
the  diplomatic  to  the  operational  level  of  the  Russian  army.  Al¬ 
though  he  received  the  personal  assurances  of  General-Major 
Sergey  Fedorovich  Tsygankov  that  future  access  would  be  pro¬ 
vided,  Lt.  Colonel  Gessert  declared  an  ambiguity.  While  the  two 
officers  were  discussing  the  issue,  a  French  team  that  included  Lt. 
Colonel  Karcz  announced  from  the  POE  that  it  would  inspect  one 
of  the  declared  sites/OOVs  at  Naro-Fominsk.  General  Tsygankov 
initially  wanted  to  refuse  the  French  permission  to  inspect  Naro- 
Fominsk  because  Team  Gessert  was  already  in  place,  and  the 
treaty  prohibited  more  than  one  team  on  a  site.  He  soon  realized 
however,  that  Naro-Fominsk  was  a  multiple  OOV  and  a  multiple 
declared  site,  and  that  the  French  were  not  requesting  the  same 
OOV  that  Gessert  was  inspecting.  He  acknowledged  the  French 
team’s  right  to  conduct  its  inspection.  They  did  so.  These  multina¬ 
tional  inspections  caused  new  discussions  at  the  JCG  in  Vienna. 
They  produced  new  assurances  from  the  Russian  representatives 
that  the  site  diagrams  and  multiple  OOV  problems  would  be 
corrected.  Three  days  after  Team  Gessert  departed  Naro-Fominsk, 
another  U.S.  team  returned.26 

On  October  9th,  Colonel  Kelley  led  a  team  augmented  by 
two  foreign  members — Lieutenant  Ole  T.  Pedersen  from  Denmark, 
and  Georges  M.  Vitse  from  France.  Their  destination  was  the  12th 
Guards  Tank  Regiment  at  Naro-Fominsk.  Again,  a  major  goal  of 
the  mission  was  to  test  the  assurances  given  by  Russian  delegates 
in  Vienna  that  site  diagrams  would  be  changed  and  inspection 
teams  granted  full  access  to  an  installation.  The  presence  of  the 
two  augmentees  signaled  to  Russia  that  a  community  of  nations, 
not  only  the  United  States,  considered  the  issue  of  site  diagrams 
and  multiple  OOVs  to  be  very  serious.  Team  Kelley  arrived  at 
Naro-Fominsk  and,  like  previous  teams,  received  a  restrictive  site

diagram  that  did  not  include  the  entire  installation.  The  Russians 
still  depicted  multiple  OOVs  as  individual  declared  sites;  the  Rus¬ 
sians  claimed  that  the  change  would  come  with  the  next  treaty 
data  exchange.  Colonel  Kelley  declared  an  ambiguity.  After  com¬ 
pleting  this  inspection,  the  team  conducted  a  sequential  declared 
site  inspection  of  the  589th  Guards  Motorized  Rifle  Regiment  at 
Totskoye.  Again  site  diagrams  were  an  issue,  and  again  Colonel 
Kelley  declared  an  ambiguity.27 

These  inspections  revealed  that  the  Russians  had  not  yet 
changed  their  position  on  OOVs  and  declared  sites,  or  that  direc¬ 
tives  to  implement  change  had  not  yet  filtered  down  to  operational 
levels  of  the  Russian  army.  In  Vienna,  JCG  discussions  continued, 
and  Russian  delegates  stated  that  Russia  would  soon  revise  the 
declared  sites  and  site  diagrams  at  issue  to  reflect  multiple  OOVs 
colocated  on  single  declared  sites.  The  Russians  indicated  that  they 
would  develop  new  site  diagrams  that  would  restrict  access  only  to 
those  areas  specific  to  another  OOV  on  the  same  declared  site. 
Russian  representatives  assured  JCG  delegates  that  these  changes 
would  appear  in  the  annual  exchange  of  data  on  December  15, 
1992.  An  encouraging  sign  that  Russia  was  making  headway  in  its 
changes  came  on  November  8,  1992.  During  an  inspection  mission 
of  Russian  forces  in  Azerbaijan,  the  Russian  site  representatives 
presented  Lt.  Colonel  Thomas  C.  Fiser,  USA,  site  diagrams  that 
indicated  multiple  OOVs  located  on  a  single  declared  site.  He 
conducted  two  inspections  on  that  mission  and  had  no  difficulties 
in  either  location  with  site  diagrams  or  inspector  access. 

On  January  14,  1993,  after  an  evaluation  of  Russia’s  Decem¬ 
ber  15,  1992,  exchange  of  treaty  information,  President  George 
Bush  presented  his  annual  “Report  to  Congress  on  Noncompli¬ 
ance  with  Arms  Control  Agreements.”  In  the  report  he  stated  that 
“the  Russian  Federation,  and  to  a  lesser  extent,  Ukraine  and 
Belarus”  had  developed  an  overly  restrictive  definition  of  a  de¬ 
clared  site,  consequently  restricting  access.  But  he  noted  that 

“In  its  December  15,  1992,  data  exchange,  the  Russian  Fed¬ 
eration  has,  however,  taken  action  to  rectify  its  data  depiction  of 
what  should  be  single  declared  sites  with  multiple  OOVs,  and 
discussions  are  continuing  in  the  Joint  Consultative  Group  to 
resolve  the  rest  of  the  access  issue.”28 

The  December  1992,  data  exchange  indicated  a  change  in  the 
Russian  position  on  declared  sites,  OOVs,  and  inspection  team 
access.  Confirmation  came  during  subsequent  declared  site  inspec¬ 
tions  in  the  reduction  phase  of  the  treaty.  The  Russians  had  indeed 
conformed  to  treaty  requirements,  but  Belarus  and  Ukraine  did 
not  follow  Russia’s  example.

Challenge  Inspections 

During  baseline,  U.S.  inspectors  conducted  only  one  challenge 
inspection.  On  August  11,  1992,  Major  Keith  A.  Oatman,  USA, 
led  his  team  to  Minsk,  Belarus.  Their  mission  was  to  inspect  a 
large  holding  of  TLE  that  had  not  been  declared  in  the  data  ex¬ 
change  of  1990.  One  hour  after  arrival  at  Minsk,  Major  Oatman 
specified  the  area  for  inspection,  an  apparent  tank  storage  facility 
at  Urechye.  Two  hours  later  Belarussian  officials  granted  the  in¬ 
spection  request,  and  within  an  hour  Team  Oatman  was  en  route 
to  Urechye.  According  to  escort  officials,  these  tanks  and  storage 
facilities  were  part  of  the  969th  Central  Tank  Reserve  Base  that 
Belarus  would  declare  in  a  matter  of  days  in  its  August  1992  data 
exchange.  Although  none  was  required,  Belarus  officials  gave 
Team  Oatman  a  modified  site  briefing  that  highlighted  the  969th’s 
relationship  to  the  other  two  OOVs  that  were  on  the  declared  site 
at  Urechye.  The  issue  of  declared  site  inspection  versus  challenge 
inspection  arose,  because  Urechye  was  a  declared  site  for  both  the 
30th  Tank  Regiment  and  the  20th  Independent  Reconnaissance 
Battalion,  and  the  specified  area  requested  for  inspection  was 
located  on  the  installation.  Ultimately,  the  Belarus  escorts  afforded 
Team  Oatman  access  to  the  tank  storage  facilities  to  complete  its 
mission,  but  denied  the  team  access  to  areas  that  were  part  of  the 
two  declared  OOVs.29

CFE  Treaty  Baseline 


Multinational  Teams 

During  the  baseline  period,  NATO  guest  inspectors  fre¬ 
quently  joined  U.S.-led  inspection  teams,  and  U.S.  inspectors  par¬ 
ticipated  as  members  of  allied  teams.  The  increase  in  inspection 
opportunities  provided  allied  governments,  through  their  guest 
inspectors,  a  broader  view  of  treaty  implementation  throughout 
Europe.  The  multinational  teams  represented  a  united  front  on 
treaty  implementation  issues  at  the  JCG,  as  had  been  the  case  in 
resolving  the  declared  site  definition  and  access  issue.  Colonel 
Brenno  Tesori  of  Italy  was  the  first  allied  inspector  to  join  a  U.S. 
team  on  a  U.S.  CFE  mission,  Team  Gessert’s  declared  site  inspec¬ 
tion  mission  to  Ukraine,  on  July  30,  1992. 30  During  the  baseline 
period,  OSIA  teams  conducted  22  inspections  with  the  assistance 
of  allied  guest  inspectors,  usually  one  or  two  augmentees  per  mis¬ 
sion.  Inspectors  from  the  Netherlands,  France,  Germany,  Den¬ 
mark,  Spain,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  Italy  represented  their 
countries  on  U.S.  teams.  The  allied  multinational  inspection  team 
foreshadowed  the  international  mix  of  team  members  subsequent 
to  baseline.  However,  while  U.S.  inspection  teams  became  multina¬ 
tional,  escort  teams  remained  strictly  American. 

U.S.  Baseline  Escort  Operations 

The  OSIA  escort  teams  stood  ready  to  react  at  nearly  a 
moment’s  notice.  Teams  initially  maintained  a  30-minute,  one- 
hour,  or  three-hour  standby.  The  team  on  30-minute  standby  lived 
on  base  in  the  21st  Replacement  Battalion  dormitory  or  the  Rhein- 
Main  Hotel.  Their  three-day  standby  rotation  matched  the  time 
blocks  of  the  NATO  baseline  deconfliction  schedule,  facilitating 
planning  for  inspection  deployments.  The  short  reaction  time  for 
escort  teams  was  driven  by  the  possibility  that  an  Eastern  team

escorts  during  a  declared  site 
inspection. 


186 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


would  declare  a  sequential  inspection  of  a  U.S.  site  in  northern 
Germany  or  in  the  flank  areas:  Turkey,  Greece,  or  Norway.  Because 
of  the  travel  time  to  distant  locations,  an  escort  team  might  need  all 
of  the  six-hour  site  preparation  time  allowed  by  the  treaty  to  arrive 
at  one  of  the  outlying  inspection  sites  before  the  inspection  team. 
The  U.S.  escort  teams  had  to  arrive  on-site  ahead  of  the  Eastern 
inspection  teams  to  avoid  delaying  the  inspection  process  and  to 
make  certain  that  the  site  was  prepared  to  receive  inspectors. 

During  baseline,  OSIA  teams  met  nine  Eastern  inspection 
teams  and  escorted  them  through  inspections  of  23  U.S.  declared 
sites.  Russian  teams  conducted  10  of  those  inspections  during  two 
missions.  Elungary,  Bulgaria,  Poland,  and  Czechoslovakia  each 
inspected  three  U.S.  facilities,  and  Romania  inspected  one  U.S.  site. 
All  Eastern  inspections  of  U.S.  declared  sites  occurred  in  Central 
Europe,  the  focal  point  of  the  treaty;  none  took  place  in  the  flanks. 
Specifically,  Eastern  teams  conducted  21  inspections  of  U.S.  forces 
stationed  in  Germany,  1  in  Belgium,  and  1  in  Luxembourg.  '1 

Russian  inspectors  recorded  the  only  ambiguities  against  U.S. 
forces  during  baseline.  During  the  second  Russian  inspection  mis¬ 
sion  of  U.S.  sites  in  September  1992,  Lt.  Colonel  Oleg  Borisovich 
Koptelov  declared  four  ambiguities.  On  September  25,  1992, 
he  declared  an  ambiguity  at  the  General  Support  Center  at 
Kaiserslautern,  Germany,  about  the  categorization  of  three  M-728 
combat  engineer  vehicles.  The  Russian  team  chief  asserted  that  the 
vehicles  should  be  considered  M-60  tanks  because  of  their  short 
muzzle,  165  millimeter  gun,  and  extra  plating.  The  American  team 
chief,  Lt.  Colonel  Thomas  C.  Fiser,  USA,  countered  that  the  M- 
728s  were  not  M-60  tanks;  the  M-728s  were  designed  for  mine- 
clearing  operations.  Fiser  cited  Article  III  of  the  treaty,  stating  that 
they  were  not  capable  of  “heavy  firepower  of  a  high  muzzle  veloc-

on  the  M-l  13  armored  personnel 
carrier.

ity  direct  fire  gun.”  The  Russian  team  chief  did 
not  agree  and  exercised  his  treaty  right  to  declare 
an  ambiguity. 

Lt.  Colonel  Koptelov  declared  two  more 
ambiguities  on  September  28th,  during  a  sequen¬ 
tial  inspection  at  Rhine  Ordnance  Barracks.  The 
first  concerned  ambulances  based  on  the  M-l  13 
armored  personnel  carrier  (APC).  Lt.  Colonel 
Koptelov  stated  that  an  M-l  13  ambulance 
should  be  considered  TLE  because,  with  the 
exception  of  quickly  removable  interior  equip¬ 
ment,  it  was  an  APC.  Major  Guy  White,  who 
replaced  Lt.  Colonel  Fiser  at  Rhine  Ordnance 
Barracks,  responded  that  because  the  vehicle 
carried  the  “red  cross  and  was  configured  for 
litters,  it  was  not  an  APC.” 

Lt.  Colonel  Koptelov’s  second  ambiguity  at 
the  Rhine  Ordnance  Barracks  dealt  with  the  site 
diagram  and  access.  The  Russian  inspection  team 
chief  stated  that  U.S.  military  facilities  on  terri¬ 
tory  west  of  the  declared  site  should  have  been 
portrayed  on  the  site  diagram.  He  observed  that 
only  a  small  road  and  chainlink  fence  separated  The  Ml  13  armored  personnel  carrier  was  a  mainstay

the  west.  Lt.  Colonel  Koptelov  added  that  two 
roads  connected  the  two  locations,  making  the  facilities  a  single 
declared  site,  and  therefore  the  western  portion  should  be  acces¬ 
sible  to  an  inspection  team.  Major  White  replied  that  the  facility  to 
the  west  was  not  associated  with  Rhine  Ordnance  Barracks — it 
was  the  Weilerbach  Ammunition  Storage  Area,  an  old  INF  site — a 
separate  facility.  Major  White  pointed  to  the  eight-foot  chainlink 
and  barbed  wire  fences  that  surrounded  both  facilities,  and  to  the 
German  civilian  road  that  bisected  the  facilities  as  evidence  that 
they  were,  in  fact,  separate  military  installations.  The  two  team 
chiefs  discussed  previous  site  diagram  and  access  disputes  that  U.S. 
inspectors  had  documented  during  inspections  of  Russian  sites. 

Major  White  maintained  that  the  situations  were  not  the  same; 
however,  Koptelov  was  not  persuaded  and  declared  an  ambiguity. 


The  Russian  inspector’s  fourth  and  final  ambiguity  arose 
during  the  last  inspection  of  his  mission,  on  September  30th,  at  the 
South  Park  Storage  at  Moenchengladbach.  After  Russian  inspec¬ 
tors  inventoried  another  30  M-l  13  based  ambulances  there, 
Koptelov  repeated  the  Russian  assertion  that  these  ambulances 
should  be  considered  APCs,  thus  TLE,  contrary  to  the  U.S.  posi¬ 
tion  that  as  ambulances  they  were  not  subject  to  the  treaty.  ’2

American  Liaison  Operations 

As  discussed  previously,  the  role  of  a  U.S.  liaison  officer 
(LNO)  was  to  protect  U.S.  interests  by  representing  the  U.S.  gov¬ 
ernment  whenever  Eastern  inspection  teams  conducted  inspections 
in  a  NATO  state.  To  ensure  readiness,  OSIA’s  liaison  teams  in 
Germany  operated  on  a  rotating  standby  schedule.  Two  primary 
standby  teams  could  deploy  within  three  hours  of  notification. 

Two  other  teams  were  on  a  six-hour  alert  and  moved  up  to  the 
three-hour  alert  when  one  of  the  primary  teams  deployed.  The 
remaining  two  teams  were  on  a  one-day  standby  schedule.  The 
forward-deployed  teams  in  Italy,  Turkey,  Spain,  and  the  United 
Kingdom  were  prepared  to  respond  at  any  time.  Twice  a  day  the 
forward-deployed  teams  checked  with  European  Operations  to 
monitor  the  status  of  treaty  activities  in  their  area.  They  also  main¬ 
tained  ties  with  the  host  nation’s  treaty  verification  agency  and 
with  the  American  Embassy. 


An  INMARSAT  provided  reliable  To  communicate  with  European  Operations  and  EUCOM 

but  bulky  communications.  when  phones  were  not  available,  each  team  deployed  with  an 

INMARSAT  (International  Maritime  Satellite)  communications 
station.  The  INMARSAT,  an  80-pound  self-contained  satellite 
communications  system,  was  reliable  and  effective,  but  very  cum¬ 
bersome.  Cellular  phones  offered  LNOs  far  greater  flexibility. 
Cellular  phones  were  not  available  to  all  LNOs  at  the  onset  of  the 
CFE  baseline,  but  were  provided  when  they  became  available.  The 
cellular  phones  were  purchased  in  Germany;  there  were  different 
national  phone  systems  throughout  Europe,  and  the  new  cellular 
phones  did  not  work  on  all  of  the  systems.  England  and  Spain 
were  two  countries  where  LNOs  experienced  some  difficulties. 
There  were  also  places  where  the  cellular  communications  systems 
had  “dead  spots.”  The  LNOs  ultimately  relied  on  their  resource¬ 
fulness  to  keep  lines  of  communication  open  with  the  host  escort 
team,  European  Operations,  and  EUCOM. 


Procedures  for  American  LNOs  varied  from  nation  to  nation. 
Before  the  baseline  period,  a  joint  State  Department  and  Joint 
Chiefs  of  Staff  (JCS)  team  traveled  throughout  the  NATO  states  to 
negotiate  bilateral  agreements  that  would  outline  specifically  what 
actions  the  American  teams  could  take  to  protect  U.S.  interests 
and  rights.  These  agreements  varied  widely.  The  U.S. -German 
agreement  mirrored  years  of  close  government  cooperation  and 
the  interaction  of  significant  U.S.  and  German  military  forces.  This 
agreement  permitted  an  American  presence  at  the  POE  when 
Eastern  inspection  teams  arrived.  Frequently  German  escort  teams 
invited  the  American  LNOs  to  ride  with  them  and  the  inspection 
team  on  the  same  bus.  The  German  escorts  kept  U.S.  LNOs  well 
informed  of  the  inspection  team’s  status  and  intentions  for  sequen¬ 
tial  inspections.  The  timeliness  of  the  German  notifications  al¬ 
lowed  American  LNOs,  through  OSIA’s  “Big  Flog”  database,  to 


189 


CFE  Treaty  Baseline 


quickly  determine  which  U.S.  forces  were  known  to  be  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  next  inspection.  Consequently,  those  forces  had  a 
better  opportunity  to  prepare  for  a  possible  inspection. 

As  discussed  previously,  maintaining  up-to-date  databases 
was  difficult  because  of  the  wide  variety  of  activities  of  U.S.  forces 
in  Europe.  On  two  occasions,  neither  OSIA  nor  EUCOM  data¬ 
bases  provided  the  American  LNOs  information  of  U.S.  forces 
located  on  sites  to  be  inspected.  In  Germany,  600  U.S.  soldiers 
participating  in  an  annual  major  NATO  exercise,  REFORGER, 
surprised  a  German  escort  team  when  they  encountered  them  near 
Hamburg.  The  American  LNO  team  standing  by  in  the  vicinity 
responded  to  the  German  discovery  and  the  inspection  proceeded 
smoothly.  A  similar  situation  arose  in  Florennes,  Belgium.  Neither 
EUCOM  nor  OSIA  databases  were  updated  to  show  the  tempo¬ 
rary  deployment  of  two  F-15  and  four  F-16  aircraft  to  a  U.S. 
training  program  in  Belgium.  However,  the  chief  liaison  officer, 
Major  Richard  J.  O’Shea,  USAF,  was  aware  that  the  training  pro¬ 
gram  existed  and  the  U.S.  liaison  team  was  able  to  alert  the  U.S. 
forces  and  prepare  them  for  the  inspection.  In  both  cases  the  U.S. 
liaison  teams,  with  the  cooperation  of  host  escort  teams,  protected 
American  interests.33 

Other  NATO  nations  took  a  much  more  restrictive  approach. 
Turkey  and  Portugal,  for  example,  preferred  to  exercise  their 
national  sovereignty  and  insisted  that  U.S.  LNOs  not  be  present  at 


U.S.  aircraft,  like  the  F-16,  could  be  found  throughout  Europe  far  from  American  sites.

the  POE  when  Eastern  teams  arrived.  In  the  opinion  of  these  na¬ 
tions,  the  inspection  process  did  not  involve  the  United  States  until 
American  forces  became  subject  to  inspection.  In  an  October  1992 
inspection,  the  Portuguese  escort  team  chief  told  the  American 
LNO,  Major  Charles  R.  Allison,  USA,  that  the  U.S.  government 
would  be  notified  through  the  American  Embassy  if  the  Russian 
team  wanted  to  inspect  U.S.  facilities.34 

Major  John  M.  Bilyeu,  USA,  had  a  similar  experience  when  a 
Bulgarian  team  arrived  in  Turkey  on  July  27,  1992.  The  Turkish 
government  had  chosen  to  minimize  U.S.  visibility  during  CFE 
inspections.  The  American  LNOs  traveled  to  the  vicinity  of  the 
POE  and  attempted  to  contact  the  escort  team  chief,  but  could 
not.  The  U.S.  team  received  no  information  from  the  Turkish 
escort  team  until  after  the  Bulgarian  team  had  conducted  two 
inspections  and  was  preparing  to  depart  the  country.  Lacking 
information,  the  American  team  deployed  to  the  only  known  U.S. 
facilities  that  were  in  the  area  of  the  POE  and  stood  by  in  case  the 
Bulgarians  opted  to  inspect  that  location.35 

In  August  1992,  it  was  clear  that  Eastern  nations  were  not 
keeping  pace  with  their  allotted  CFE  baseline  inspection  quotas. 

It  also  became  apparent  that  the  Eastern  inspection  teams  were 
inspecting  several  sites  during  each  mission,  thus  minimizing  travel 
expenses.  For  U.S.  liaison  teams  this  implied  far  fewer  deploy¬ 
ments  to  POEs,  but  it  also  meant  longer  missions  when  they  did 
deploy. 

In  late  August,  Lt.  Colonel  Stephen  A.  Barneby,  USA,  Chief 
of  the  Plans  Branch,  evaluated  the  Eastern  states’  inspection  pat¬ 
tern  and  recommended  cutting  the  number  of  forward-deployed 
liaison  teams.  On  September  3,  1992,  Colonel  William  R.  Smith, 
USAF,  Commander,  OSIA  European  Operations  Command,  agreed 
and  proposed  the  cuts  to  Headquarters  OSIA.  In  mid-September, 
the  United  States  reduced  its  forward-deployed  LNO  presence  to 
single  teams  in  Italy,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  Turkey.  The  single 
team  in  Spain  was  eliminated.  Colonel  Kelley  decided  that  Lt. 
Colonel  Barneby,  a  West  European  foreign  area  officer  (FAO)  who 
had  come  to  European  Operations  Command  in  July  1992  from  a 
three-year  tour  in  Spain,  would  deploy  from  Frankfurt  to  Spain 
when  required.  Throughout  the  rest  of  the  baseline  period,  the 
remaining  LNO  teams  fulfilled  the  JCS  requirement  to  provide  an 
American  presence  to  protect  American  rights  and  interests  when¬ 
ever  an  Eastern  inspection  team  entered  a  NATO  state.36 

U.S.  Baseline  Reduction  Inspections 

Under  the  CFE  Treaty,  reduction  inspections  provided  the 
primary  means  to  determine  that  nations  were  meeting  their  obli¬ 
gations  to  reduce  TLE.  Western  reduction  inspection  teams  were 


191 


CFE  Treaty  Baseline 


usually  multinational,  and  team  leadership  varied  from  mission  to 
mission.  The  NATO  VCC  designated  which  nation  would  lead 
reduction  inspection  teams  for  the  group  of  16  states.  Rotating 
team  leadership  spread  the  burden  of  the  expense  and  the  diffi¬ 
culty  of  providing  transportation,  billeting,  and  meals  associated 
with  the  inspection  effort.  Many  nations,  however,  declined  the 
opportunity  to  lead  reduction  teams  during  baseline,  largely  be¬ 
cause  of  the  cost. 

Initially,  the  Eastern  states  reduced  small  sets  of  equipment 
over  a  30-day  period,  causing  Western  inspection  teams  to  deploy 
frequently.  Colonel  Smith  suggested  that  the  VCC  consider  de¬ 
creasing  the  size  of  reduction  inspection  teams  to  reduce  costs. 
While  other  nations  declined  leading  reduction  inspection  teams, 
the  U.S.  government’s  policy  dictated  that  at  least  one  U.S.  repre¬ 
sentative  would  participate  on  any  reduction  mission  and  that  the 
United  States  would  accept  the  lead  on  a  mission  whenever  the 
VCC  offered  it.  Colonel  Smith  also  recommended  that  nations 
lengthen  their  reduction  periods  to  the  allowable  90  days  and 
increase  the  amount  of  equipment  for  reduction,  thereby  decreas¬ 
ing  the  number  of  reduction  inspections.  During  the  baseline  pe¬ 
riod,  U.S.  inspectors  led  5  of  the  23  NATO  alliance  reduction 
inspection  teams  and  participated  in  12  others. 


At  least  one  U.S. 
representative  would 
participate  on  any  reduction

States  would  accept  the  lead 
whenever  offered. 


The  VCC  maintained  the  information  for 
subsequent  use  by  the  closure  inspection  team 
that  would  return  to  Wuensdorf  to  confirm  the 
reduction  of  the  remaining  98  pieces  of  equip¬ 
ment.  The  Wuensdorf  reduction  period  high¬ 
lighted  the  VCC’s  critical  role  in  scheduling  and 
data  collection  for  reduction  missions.  The 
United  States  did  not  lead  the  follow-up  team, 
but  that  team  prepared  for  the  mission  based  on 
the  information  provided  by  the  VCC.  During

The  first  U.S. -led  mission  was  in  Germany.37  Lt.  Colonel  John 
D.  Pesterfield,  USAF,  led  the  first  U.S.  reduction  team  to  the  Capi¬ 
tal  Repair  Plant  at  Wuensdorf,  Germany,  on  August  6,  1992.  Team 
Pesterfield  was  composed  of  five  Americans,  an  Italian,  a  Belgian, 
a  Canadian,  and  an  inspector  from  the  United  Kingdom.  While 
conducting  an  opening  inspection,  the  team  checked  and  recorded 
the  serial  numbers  of  the  100  ACVs  to  be  reduced  over  the  next  30 
days.  The  team  also  watched  and  confirmed  the  destruction  of  two 
ACVs — a  BMP-1  and  a  BTR-60.  Lt.  Colonel 
Pesterfield  signed  the  inspection  report  on  Au¬ 
gust  8th,  indicating  that  his  team  had  confirmed 
the  destruction  of  two  ACVs  and  recorded  the 
serial  numbers  of  those  yet  to  be  destroyed.  Team 
Pesterfield’s  data  were  available  to  the  govern¬ 
ments  involved  in  the  inspection  and  were  sub¬ 
mitted  to  NATO’s  VCC.

the  baseline  period,  OSIA  inspectors  led  four  other  reduction 
inspections,  two  to  Ukraine,  one  to  Poland,  and  one  to  Bulgaria. 
All  five  reduction  inspections  were  successful  multinational  efforts 
and  provided  evidence  that  nations  were  satisfying  the  treaty’s 
central  objective:  reducing  military  hardware  in  Central  Europe. 3S 


Operational  Issues 

American  inspection  teams  encountered  various  difficulties 
during  the  CFE  baseline.  The  major  problems  that  arose  concerned 
the  definition  of  a  declared  site  and  the  resulting  difficulties  with 
inspector  access.  As  the  baseline  ended,  however,  Western  states 
held  a  cautious  optimism  that  Russia  had  resolved  these  problems. 
Ukraine  and  Belarus,  however,  offered  no  indication  of  changing 
their  restrictive  approach  to  the  definition  of  a  declared  site.  The 
issue  of  U.S.  armored  ambulances  versus  M-l  13  APCs  also  re¬ 
mained  unresolved.  Communications  provided  the  most  frequent 
operational  problems  that  OSIA  teams  confronted. 

During  the  early  stages  of  baseline,  OSIA  European  Opera¬ 
tions  occasionally  had  to  modify  notification  messages  because 
aircrew  identification  was  inaccurate  or  because  treaty-required 
data  had  to  be  changed.  European  Operations  had  no  control  over 
aircrew  identification  information,  which  was  the  responsibility  of 
the  aircrews’  wing.  In  fact,  EO  could  not  confirm  aircrew  data 
until  the  crews  arrived  in  Frankfurt.  Colonel  Smith  recognized  that 
late  changes  to  inspection  notification  messages  were  an  irritant  to 
State  Department  communications  specialists.  Yet,  he  took  excep- 


Bulgarian  escorts  stand  on  a  treaty- 
limited  tank  converted  for  static

tion  to  their  insistence  that  no  changes  could  be  made  after  the 
initial  message  submission.  On  three  occasions  during  July-August 
1992,  State  Department  representatives  balked  at  transmitting  late 
message  changes.  The  problem  was  simple  to  state,  but  difficult  to 
resolve.  On  the  one  hand,  Colonel  Smith  had  to  provide 
manditory  treaty  information  about  the  inspections  to  the  treaty 
states.  On  the  other  hand,  the  State  Department  had  to  transmit 
accurate,  standardized  message  data  to  foreign  nations  through  the 
American  embassies.  When  operational  pressures  created  require¬ 
ments  for  changing  the  data,  network  standards  resisted  any 
changes.  Friction  resulted.  The  problem  was  resolved  over  time 
by  closer  coordination  on  the  manditory  CFE  Treaty  data  require¬ 
ments  and  by  better  advance  mission  planning.  By  the  end  of  the 
baseline  period,  communicating  messages  over  the  State  Depart¬ 
ment  network  had  improved  considerably. 

Another  communications  problem  stemmed  from  host  na¬ 
tions’  providing  late  announcements  that  they  had  received  intent- 
to-inspect  messages,  and  sometimes  that  information  came  only 
through  informal  channels.  This  problem  continued  throughout 
the  baseline  period.  As  late  as  November  12,  1992,  118  days  into 
baseline,  Greece  notified  the  United  States  of  a  Hungarian  inspec¬ 
tion  that  had  started  two  days  earlier.  In  this  case,  an  American 
LNO  was  not  in  place  to  protect  U.S.  interests.39  Late  notifications 
frequently  put  U.S.  liaison  teams  in  the  position  of  catching  up 
with  inspection  teams.  These  notification  problems,  coupled  with 
some  nations’  practice  of  keeping  U.S.  liaison  teams  at  a  distance, 
made  it  difficult  for  LNOs  to  gather  information  and  be  certain 
that  all  U.S.  interests  were  protected  during  inspections. 

The  strict  “letter  of  the  law”  approach  to  treaty  implementa¬ 
tion  taken  by  OSIA  teams  periodically  strained  working  relations, 
especially  when  U.S.  methods  were  compared  with  the  “spirit  of 
the  law”  approach  taken  by  other  nations.  As  directed  by  the 
National  Security  Council,  OSIA  teams  implemented  the  treaty 
without  deviation.  American  army  field  commanders  complained 
to  Headquarters  USAREUR  that  OSIA  team  chiefs  were  too  rigid 
in  their  interpretation  of  treaty  timeline  requirements;  that  OSIA 
team  chiefs  would  not  allow  time  requirements  to  be  relaxed  so 
that  inspection  could  begin  in  the  morning  instead  of  late  at  night. 
This  would  prevent  calling  civilians  into  work  on  overtime  and 
keeping  military  personnel  on  duty  for  lengthy  periods.  Field  com¬ 
manders  pointed  out  that  other  nations  took  a  much  more  casual 
approach  to  treaty  implementation. 

Similarly,  Eastern  inspectors  expressed  displeasure  that  OSIA 
teams  arrived  late  at  night  or  on  weekends,  causing  difficulties 
with  their  work  force.40  What  was  not  known  to  Eastern  escort 
teams  was  the  VCC  scheduling  of  inspections  and  the  NATO- 
imposed  three-day  inspection  time  block.  When  U.S.  teams  de-

ployed,  they  had  little  choice  but  to  execute  their  plan.  An  Eastern 
escort  team  might  have  been  willing  to  allow  an  American  team  to 
relax  time  requirements;  however,  by  agreeing,  the  American  team 
might  have  prevented  another  team,  U.S.  or  allied,  from  conduct¬ 
ing  a  planned  inspection  several  hours  later.  The  120-day  baseline 
was  a  relatively  short  period  in  which  to  complete  numerous  in¬ 
spections,  and  there  were  bound  to  be  inconveniences  associated 
with  any  large-scale  effort.  Illustrative  of  many  states’  outlook  was 
a  Bulgarian  inspector’s  comment  during  an  inspection  in  Belgium: 
“The  main  goal  of  the  treaty  had  been  accomplished  by  signing  the 
treaty,  and  the  inspections  were  merely  a  formality.”41 

Many  inspectors  from  nations  in  both  groups  of  states  cited 
the  “spirit  of  the  treaty”  as  a  guide  for  implementation.  The  U.S. 
experience  during  INF  Treaty  implementation,  however,  indicated 
that  participants  adhering  strictly  to  treaty  requirements  had  little 
doubt  concerning  their  own  or  their  counterparts’  responsibilities 
and  rights.  OSIA’s  Director,  Major  General  Robert  W.  Parker, 
USAF,  expressed  that  view  in  a  letter  to  USAREUR’s  Major  Gen¬ 
eral  Joseph  T.  Davies,  USA,  on  the  issue  of  inspection  teams’  late 
arrivals  and  briefings  at  U.S.  facilities.  Parker  pointed  out  that 
host  state  escort  teams,  not  OSIA  liaison  or  escort  teams,  delivered 
inspection  teams  to  a  site  following  treaty  guidelines.  Once  at  the 
site,  the  U.S.  government  had  specific  treaty  obligations  to  fulfill. 
General  Parker  stated  categorically  that  he  “would  not  apologize 
for  OSIA  standards  of  inspection.”  He  said  that  OSIA  inspectors 
followed  the  treaty  strictly  so  that  there  would  be  no  doubt  as  to 
what  the  requirements  were  and  so  that  those  requirements  would 
be  fulfilled.  He  asserted  that  in  this  way  everyone’s  rights  were 
being  protected. 


General  Parker  “would  not 
apologize  for  OSIA 
standards  of  inspection.” 


Despite  communication  and  perception  problems,  OSIA 
inspectors,  escorts,  and  FNOs  succeeded  in  fulfilling  their  respon¬ 
sibilities  and  protecting  the  rights  of  the  United  States  as  outlined 
in  the  CFE  Treaty.  Problems  that  arose  during  inspections  were 
discussed  and  handled  in  a  professional  manner  by  OSIA  team 
members  and  their  counterparts.  Even  in  situations  that  resulted 
in  declarations  of  ambiguities,  inspection  and  escort  teams  main¬ 
tained  an  “operational”  atmosphere,  leaving  resolution  of  prob¬ 
lems  to  their  governments. 


During  baseline,  OSIA  inspection  teams  traveled  33  times 
into  Eastern  nations  to  conduct  44  inspections.  On  one  other 
occasion  a  team  traveled  to  Moscow  only  to  reschedule  the  mis¬ 
sion  because  of  poor  weather  conditions  at  the  inspection  site.  The 
U.S.  completed  98  percent  of  the  45  missions  available  to  it. 
Meanwhile,  Eastern  teams  completed  only  66  percent  of  the  34 
inspections  available  to  them  at  U.S.  declared  sites.  OSIA  escort 
teams  responded  to  9  Eastern  inspection  missions  to  23  inspection 
sites.

Reduction  Years

“Committed  to  the  objectives  of  establishing  a  secure  and  stable 
balance  of  conventional  armed  forces  in  Europe  at  lower  levels  than 
heretofore,  of  eliminating  disparities  prejudicial  to  stability  and 
security  and  of  eliminating,  as  a  matter  of  high  priority,  the  capabil¬ 
ity  for  launching  surprise  attack  and  for  initiating  large  scale  action 
in  Europe,...  the  States  Parties  have  agreed  as  follows:...” 


These  objectives  are  found  in  the  CFE  Treaty  Preamble.  To 
fulfill  them,  the  treaty  requires  the  elimination  of  specific 
quantities  of  conventional  armaments  located  in  the  treaty’s 
area  of  application  within  specific  timelines.  The  elimination — or, 
in  treaty  terms,  the  reduction — of  equipment  had  to  be  complete, 
irreversible,  and  verifiable.  The  Eastern  group  of  states’  agreement 
to  asymmetrical  reductions  was  instrumental  in  enabling  the  two 
groups  of  states  to  eliminate  the  disparities  in  force  strength  that 
were  “prejudicial  to  stability.”  Collectively,  the  Eastern  states, 
previously  the  Warsaw  Treaty  Organization  (WTO)  states,  would 
reduce  more  equipment  than  the  NATO  alliance  nations  because 
they  held  a  significant  numerical  superiority  in  conventional  arma¬ 
ments  in  Europe.

At  treaty  signature,  the  reduction  liability  of  the  NATO  states 
stood  at  12,914  pieces  of  equipment,  the  majority  of  which  was 
equipment  of  the  former  German  Democratic  Republic.  The 
NATO  states  placed  greater  reduction  liabilities  on  themselves 
than  the  treaty  required  by  setting  their  tank,  armored  combat 
vehicle  (ACV),  and  artillery  ceilings  below  those  outlined  in  the 
treaty.  In  contrast,  the  Eastern  group  of  states  possessed  34,665 
pieces  of  equipment  for  reduction.  Regardless  of  quantity,  the 
treaty  required  each  group  to  complete  its  reductions  within  40 
months  of  the  treaty’s  entry  into  force.1

Soviets  transferred  more  than 
57,000  pieces  ofTLE  east  of  the 
Urals. 


As  discussed  in  a  previous  chapter,  the  Eastern  states’  figures 
for  treaty-limited  equipment  (TLE)  from  data  exchanged  shortly 
after  treaty  signature  surprised  the  United  States  and  the  NATO 
allies.  The  Soviets  had  transferred  more  than  57,000  pieces  of 
equipment  out  of  the  treaty’s  area  of  application  before  November 
19,  1990.  In  addition  to  moving  equipment  east  of  the  Urals,  the 
Soviets  had  reassigned  portions  of  its  conventional  armaments  to 
coastal  defense  forces,  naval  infantry  units,  and  the  Strategic 
Rocket  Forces.  The  Soviets  claimed  that  these  forces  and  their 
conventional  equipment  were  not  subject  to  the  treaty.  The  NATO 
states  countered  that  TLE  within  the  ATTU  (Atlantic  to  the  Urals) 
was  TLE,  regardless  of  the  organization  that  possessed  it.  It  was 
accountable.  The  Soviet  movement  of  equipment  east  of  the  Urals 
raised  concerns  that  the  Soviets  could  quickly  reintroduce  those 
weapons  into  the  ATTU.  Some  nations  declared  that  shifting  the 
TLE  east  of  the  Urals  was  a  circumvention  of  the  treaty.  These 
Soviet  actions  brought  on  political  and  diplomatic  debate  that 
stalled  ratification  of  the  treaty.  On  June  14,  1991,  after  months  of 
lengthy  and  heated  Joint  Consultative  Group  (JCG)  negotiations, 
Soviet  representatives  submitted  pledges  addressing  both  the 
equipment  east  of  the  Urals  and  the  reassigned  TLE  within  the 
ATTU.  These  pledges  allowed  the  ratification  process  to  move 
forward. 

One  Soviet  pledge  provided  a  legally  binding  solution  to  the 
TLE  held  by  the  Strategic  Rocket  Forces,  naval  infantry,  and 
coastal  defense  forces.  The  Soviets  agreed  to  limit  TLE  assigned  to 
the  naval  infantry  and  coastal  defense  forces  not  to  exceed  a  total 
933  tanks,  1,080  pieces  of  artillery,  and  972  ACVs.  In  addition, 
the  Soviets  agreed  to  increase  their  total  treaty  reduction  liability

by  the  same  totals.  They  would  accomplish  50  percent  of  those 
reductions  within  the  ATTU  and  would  reduce  the  other  50  per¬ 
cent  in  the  east  after  transferring  that  amount  of  equipment  out  of 
the  ATTU.  Once  the  Soviets  transferred  the  equipment,  they  would 
reduce  that  same  equipment  or  an  equal  number  of  the  same  type 
of  equipment.  The  Soviets  would  not  incur  any  reduction  liabilities 
associated  with  the  1,701  armored  personnel  carriers  (APCs) 
assigned  to  the  Strategic  Rocket  Forces. 

The  other  pledge,  politically  binding,  dealt  with  the  equip¬ 
ment  the  Soviets  had  transferred  east  of  the  Urals  prior  to  treaty 
signature.  The  Soviets  pledged  to  reduce  at  least  14,500  pieces  of 
that  equipment.  This  broke  down  to  6,000  tanks,  1,500  ACVs, 
and  7,000  pieces  of  artillery.  These  reductions  were  in  addition  to 
the  obligations  they  had  assumed  concerning  naval  infantry  and 
coastal  defense  forces.  The  combined  reduction  obligations  for 
equipment  the  Soviets  had  moved  or  would  move  east  of  the  Urals, 
as  outlined  in  the  two  pledges,  totaled  15,993  items,  specifically: 
6,467  tanks,  7,540  pieces  of  artillery,  and  1,986  ACVs.2  There 
was,  however,  one  major  difference  between  reductions  on  the  two 
sides  of  the  Urals.  The  NATO  states  could  inspect  all  reductions 
within  the  ATTU — the  Soviets  had  no  right  of  refusal.  East  of  the 
Urals,  however,  satellite  reconnaissance  was  the  only  means  the 
NATO  states  had  for  monitoring  reductions.  The  Soviets  stated  in 
their  pledge  that  all  reductions  in  the  East  would  be  readily  visible 
for  satellite  observation. 


The  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union  on  Christmas  Day  1991 
threw  reduction  liabilities  for  the  Eastern  group  of  states  into  a 
muddle.  Out  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  arose  eight  new  treaty 
states:  Belarus,  Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  Moldova,  Georgia, 
Kazakstan,  Ukraine,  and  Russia.  The  new  nations  of  the  former 
Soviet  Union  had  no  agreement  on  equipment  ownership,  much 
less  who  would  be  responsible  for  reductions.  Individual  signatory 
states,  not  the  group,  were  responsible  for  treaty  implementation, 
and  the  NATO  nations  could  not  ratify  the  treaty  without  the 
former  Soviet  states  acknowledging  their  reduction  liabilities.  As 
the  new  states  focused  on  forming  new  governments,  resolving 
domestic  issues,  and  dealing  with  armed  hostilities,  it  appeared 
that  they  would  not  soon  agree  on  TLE  and  reduction  allocations. 
However,  on  May  15,  1992,  at  Tashkent,  Uzbekistan,  the  new 
republics  came  to  a  dramatic  agreement  on  the  national  distribu¬ 
tion  of  the  former  USSR’s  military  hardware  and  established  ceil¬ 
ings  for  holdings  in  the  various  categories  of  equipment.  This 
agreement  led  directly  to  the  Oslo  Extraordinary  Conference  in 
June  1992,  where  all  signatory  nations  had  sufficient  confidence 
to  proceed  with  ratification  based  on  the  understanding  that  the 
combined  reduction  obligations  of  the  newly  emerged  nations 
would  equal  those  of  the  former  Soviet  Union.3

Reduction  Years 


Months  later,  after  the  treaty  entered  into  force,  it  was  clear 
that  the  individual  nations  had  not  reached  agreement  on  all  of 
their  reduction  liabilities.  The  exchange  of  treaty  data  on  Decem¬ 
ber  15,  1992,  indicated  that  the  new  nations’  liabilities,  when 
totaled,  would  not  equal  the  original  Soviet  obligation.  The  origi¬ 
nal  Soviet  reduction  liabilities,  not  including  the  reductions  re¬ 
quired  under  the  agreement  on  coastal  defense  forces  and  naval 
infantry,  included  7,575  tanks,  9,890  ACVs,  763  artillery,  1,461 
combat  aircraft,  and  no  helicopters.  The  new  data  showed  short¬ 
falls  in  declared  reduction  liabilities  of  1,789  tanks  and  819  ACVs, 
while  producing  overages  of  68  pieces  of  artillery,  401  combat 
aircraft,  and  115  attack  helicopters. 

The  disparities  stemmed  partly  from  confusion  over  invento¬ 
ries  as  new  governments  continued  to  be  embroiled  in  domestic 
issues,  and  some  even  in  armed  conflict.  None  of  the  nations  had 
the  expertise  that  the  Russian  Nuclear  Risk  Reduction  Center 
(NRRC)  had  developed  through  implementation  of  previous  arms 
control  treaties.  The  armed  hostilities  in  the  Transcaucasus  nations 
(Azerbaijan,  Armenia,  Georgia)  and  in  Moldova  were  a  major 
reason  for  the  shortfall  in  reduction  liabilities  for  tanks  and  ACVs. 
Nongovernment  forces  controlled  some  of  the  hardware  in  the 
region,  ongoing  battles  had  destroyed  or  heavily  damaged  other 
pieces,  and  withdrawing  Russian  troops  had  left  behind  equipment 


The  new  nations  of  the  Caucasus  were  reluctant  to  declare  broken-down  equipment  left 
behind  by  the  Russian  army.

suitable  only  for  scrap.  Most  important,  no  one 
claimed  ownership  or  responsibility  for  the 
equipment.  In  addition,  Armenia  and  Azerbaijan, 
involved  in  heavy  fighting,  wanted  recognition 
for  TLE  destroyed  in  combat,  but  the  treaty  did 
not  allow  for  battlefield  losses.  These  new  na¬ 
tions  reported  no  reduction  liabilities  yet  they 
reported  possessing  equipment  in  excess  of  the 
ceilings  agreed  to  at  Tashkent.4  During  the  two 
subsequent  years,  JCG  discussions  brought  some 
clarification  as  the  shortfall  decreased  to  539 
tanks  and  1,394  ACVs  by  November  1994. 
Azerbaijan’s  and  Armenia’s  failure  to  declare  a 
reduction  liability  contributed  significantly  to  the 
1994  shortfall. 

Shortly  after  the  third  reduction  year,  Arme¬ 
nia  announced  its  holdings,  as  did  Azerbaijan; 
both  still  had  more  ACVs  than  the  Tashkent 
agreement  allowed,  Armenia  by  65  and 
Azerbaijan  by  615.  Azerbaijan  also  held  58  more 
pieces  of  artillery  than  the  285  agreed  upon  at 
Tashkent.  Belarus  faced  economic  problems  that 
forced  a  postponement  of  its  reductions  during 
the  third  reduction  year;  it  held  548  tanks,  446 
ACVs,  and  88  aircraft  to  be  reduced.  Although 
Belarus  resumed  reductions,  it  did  not  meet  its 
goals  before  November  17,  1995. 


Despite  these  problems,  the  former  Soviet 
states  reduced  enough  TLE  as  a  group  to  be  below  their  ceilings 
for  all  categories  of  TLE.  These  reductions,  coupled  with  the  suc¬ 
cess  of  the  Eastern  European  states  during  the  third  reduction  year, 
led  to  the  former  Warsaw  Pact  states’  meeting  their  CFE  treaty 
ceilings.  As  of  November  1995,  all  NATO  nations  met  their  reduc¬ 
tion  goals  and  both  groups  of  states  were  under  the  treaty  ceiling 
for  all  categories  of  TLE. 


The  U.S.  reduction  liability  at  treaty  signature  and  entry  into 
force  was  1,898  tanks,  375  ACVs,  and  109  pieces  of  artillery.  The 
United  States  quickly  decreased  its  reduction  liabilities,  because  the 
NATO  group  of  states  agreed  to  transfer  equipment,  along  with 
the  equivalent  reduction  liability,  among  themselves.  A  treaty- 
authorized  transfer,  colloquially  called  “cascading,”  allowed  the 
United  States,  Netherlands,  Germany,  and  Italy  to  transfer  TLE  to 
other  NATO  states.  The  NATO  Equipment  Transfer  Plan  allowed 
donor  states  to  bring  their  TLE  holdings  down  to  treaty-declared 
levels  to  avoid  reduction  costs  and  to  modernize  and  standardize 
armaments  throughout  the  alliance.  The  initial  planning  for  cas¬ 
caded  NATO  equipment  totaled  2,578  tanks,  1,114  ACVs,  and

180  pieces  of  artillery.  By  the  end  of  1993  the  final  distribution 
differed  only  slightly  from  the  initial  plan. 

The  U.S.  European  Command,  the  United  States’  executive 
agent  for  the  CFE  Treaty,  managed  the  cascading  of  U.S.  TLE  and 
contracted  for  the  destruction  of  the  632  excess  M-47  tanks  in 
Buccino,  Italy,  and  7  M-47  tanks  and  4  M-44  howitzers  at  the  U.S. 
Army  Depot  at  Germersheim,  Germany.  Italian  contractors  con¬ 
ducted  the  first  U.S.  reductions  at  Buccino  on  January  28,  1993. 
Buccino  was  also  the  site  for  the  final  U.S.  TLE  reductions  on 
November  12,  1993.  The  combined  cascading  and  destruction  of 
TLE  enabled  the  United  States  to  reach  its  declared  TLE  ceilings 
of  4,006  tanks,  5,372  ACVs,  and  2,492  pieces  of  artillery.  The 
United  States  had  no  reduction  liabilities  for  combat  aircraft  and

helicopters  because  it  held  334  combat  aircraft  against  a  ceiling  of 
784  and  341  helicopters  against  a  ceiling  of  518.  Thus  there  was 
no  U.S.  cascading  or  reduction  for  either  category.' 


Reduction  Methods 

Reduction  methods  varied  depending  on  the  type  of  equip¬ 
ment,  and  several  options  were  available  to  reduce  any  piece  of 
equipment.  Destruction  was  the  primary  means  of  reducing  TLE, 
and  technicians  could  employ  several  methods  to  accomplish  it.  As 
an  option  to  destroying  all  equipment,  the  treaty  authorized  modi¬ 
fying  a  small  portion  of  TLE  for  nonoffensive  purposes.  Tanks 
could  be  converted  into  bulldozers,  or  combat  helicopters  into 
support  helicopters.  States  could  also  elect  to  modify  equipment 
for  use  as  trainers,  static  displays,  or  training  targets. 

The  Protocol  on  Reduction  allowed  severing  as  a  method  of 
destroying  all  types  of  TLE,  such  as  the  American  M-47  tanks. 

The  protocol  did  not  dictate  a  particular  technology  to  sever  TLE, 
but  it  detailed  the  cuts  required  for  each  category  of  equipment. 
Tanks,  for  example,  required  specific  cuts  for  the  gun  breech  ring, 
the  gun  tube,  one  gun  trunnion  and  mount,  and  the  hull.  The

guidance  on  specific  cuts  included  location,  length,  and  number  of 
cuts,  as  well  as  the  extent  of  material  to  be  removed  in  a  cut.  Sev¬ 
ering  with  torches  was  the  primary  method  used  to  reduce  TLE. 

While  most  states  chose  to  sever  equipment,  Poland  chose  to 
smash  much  of  its  TLE.  Smashing  was  cheap  and  efficient.  Techni¬ 
cians  positioned  equipment  on  a  pad  below  an  eight-ton  wrecking 
ball  suspended  on  a  crane  and  repeatedly  dropped  the  ball  on 
tanks,  ACVs,  and  artillery  until  they  achieved  the  desired  results. 
The  pad  on  which  the  technicians  centered  the  TLE  enabled  them 
to  smash  their  equipment  successfully.  According  to  Colonel 
Stanislaw  Malinowski,  Director  of  the  Polish  Verification  Center, 
“It  has  to  be  made  of  a  special  material  that  can  be  enduring.  If 
not,  it  is  easily  smashed  up  with  three  or  four  droppings  of  the 
ball.  So  the  composition,  the  material  that  is  used. ..is  patented  by 
Poland.”  The  surface  withstood  the  pounding  as  the  Poles  success¬ 
fully  destroyed  their  TLE.6 

The  treaty  provided  for  two  other  destruction  methods,  but 
states  did  not  use  them  because  they  were  expensive  and  less  effi¬ 
cient.  NATO  allies  conducted  tests  to  develop  an  inexpensive  and 
effective  method  for  explosive  demolition  of  TLE,  but  the  tests 
produced  poor  results.  The  treaty  also  allowed  for  the  deformation 
of  tanks,  helicopters,  and  combat  aircraft.  Superheating  the  equip¬ 
ment  before  pressing  the  weakened  metal  led  to  satisfactory  re¬ 
sults,  but  the  expense  and  efficiency  precluded  that  method. 


The  Reduction  Process 

Reduction  of  TLE  under  the  CFE  Treaty  was  a  multinational 
effort.  The  process  began  with  each  nation  working  within  its 
group  of  states  to  determine  its  reduction  liability.  Based  on  its 
reduction  liability,  a  state  determined  the  number  of  reduction

sites  required  to  reduce  its  TLE.  The  treaty  did  not  limit  the  num¬ 
ber  of  reduction  sites  a  state  could  designate,  but  it  did  restrict  the 
number  of  sites  engaged  in  reductions  at  any  given  time  to  20. 

This  number  proved  to  be  far  in  excess  of  what  any  nation  actu¬ 
ally  organized.  Poland  required  only  four  sites  during  the  first 
reduction  year  to  begin  reducing  its  sizable  liability  of  nearly 
1,200  tanks,  715  pieces  of  artillery,  300  ACVs,  and  41  aircraft.  By 
the  end  of  the  first  year,  Poland  had  reduced  its  41  aircraft  and 
closed  its  aircraft  reduction  site.  Polish  planners  evaluated  their 
progress  and  elected  to  close  a  second  site  because  the  two  remain¬ 
ing  sites  would  be  sufficient  for  their  needs." 

Reducing  massive  amounts  of  equipment,  such  as  tanks  and 
APCs,  within  treaty  timelines  required  scheduling.  The  treaty 
mandated  that  states  complete  at  least  25  percent  of  their  reduc¬ 
tions  during  the  first  reduction  year,  followed  by  35  and  40  per¬ 
cent  of  the  total  in  the  final  two  years.  In  addition,  the  treaty 
required  states  to  reduce  equipment  in  blocks  of  time  of  not  less 
than  30  and  not  more  than  90  days,  known  as  calendar  reporting 
periods.  Moreover,  the  capacity  of  reduction  sites,  in  terms  of 
space  and  work  flow  and  the  movement  of  equipment  to  and  from 
the  sites,  dictated  that  the  work  be  spread  out  over  time.  Cost,  a 
major  consideration  for  the  Eastern  states,  slowed  work  flow 
because  of  the  expense  of  labor  and  materials. 

Once  the  reducing  state  had  planned  reductions  for  a  specific 
calendar  reporting  period,  it  opened  the  process  to  the  other  signa¬ 
tory  nations  through  an  official  notification.  The  treaty  obligated 
the  reducing  state  to  provide  at  least  15  days’  advance  notice  of 
reductions.  The  state  announced  the  reduction  site,  the  quantities 
and  types  of  equipment,  the  OOVs  that  were  releasing  the  equip¬ 
ment,  the  method  of  reduction,  and  the  dates  of  the  reporting 
period.  The  notification  also  indicated  the  final  date  and  time

inspection  teams  could  arrive  at  a  specific  point  of  entry  (POE)  to 
view  the  equipment  before  the  reduction  began.  In  addition  to 
giving  notice  of  the  reduction,  the  reducing  state  had  to  display  the 
equipment  for  inspectors.  The  requirements  for  display  varied:  A 
fuselage  satisfied  the  requirement  for  an  aircraft,  whereas  a  proper 
tank  display  included  the  hull,  turret,  and  integral  main  armament. 
In  all  cases,  the  displayed  TLE  had  to  be  available  for  inspection 
before  reduction,  and  they  had  to  be  complete  assemblies,  a  re¬ 
quirement  that  would  become  an  issue  during  U.S.  inspections. 

The  reducing  state  also  established  a  register  to  document  serial 
numbers  and  to  record  the  start  and  completion  dates  of  reduction 
for  each  piece  of  equipment. 

Once  an  Eastern  state  sent  a  notification  of  reduction,  the 
VCC  sought  a  NATO  state  to  lead  the  reduction  inspection.  The 
VCC  polled  member  states  to  determine  leadership  and  participa¬ 
tion  on  the  reduction  inspection  team.  Some  nations  frequently 
declined;  however,  the  U.S.  government’s  policy  to  lead  reduction 
inspections  and  participate  whenever  possible  ensured  that  a 
NATO  team  would  inspect  each  Eastern  reduction.  The  nation 
leading  the  inspection  team  assumed  responsibility  to  announce  its 
intent  to  inspect,  to  assemble  and  prepare  the  team,  and  to  trans¬ 
port  the  team  to  and  from  the  POE. 

The  inspected  state  had  no  right  of  refusal  to  a  reduction 
inspection,  and  the  treaty  allowed  inspectors  to  be  present 
throughout  the  calendar  reporting  period  to  view  all  reductions.  In 
practice,  however,  one  team  normally  conducted  an  opening  in¬ 
spection  at  the  beginning  of  the  calendar  reporting  period  to 
record  serial  numbers  of  the  equipment  slated  for  reduction.  The 
team  then  departed,  and  later  another  team  conducted  a  closing 
inspection  to  confirm  the  proper  reduction  of  TLE  and  to  match 
serial  numbers  against  those  previously  recorded.  Lt.  Colonel 
Thomas  C.  Fiser,  USA,  recalled  that  during  his  first  reduction 
inspection,  an  opening  inspection  at  Tapioszesco,  Hungary,  he 
required  only  20  minutes  to  record  the  serial  numbers  of  the  14 
D1  152-millimeter  howitzers  to  be  reduced.  His  team  needed  just 
over  12  hours  to  conduct  the  inspection,  confirm  that  the  site 
reduction  register  was  correct,  and  sign  the  inspection  report  with 
the  escort  team  chief.  Less  than  one  day  on-site  was  the  norm  for 
U.S.  reduction  inspections,  but  there  were  exceptions.* 

Lt.  Colonel  Edward  G.  Gallagher,  II,  USA,  Chief  of  the  In¬ 
spection  and  Escort  Branch  at  OSIA’s  European  Operations  Com¬ 
mand,  led  a  three-day  reduction  inspection  of  Dabrowa  Gornicza, 
Poland.  Team  Gallagher  arrived  at  the  site  on  October  26,  1992, 
and  remained  there  until  October  29 — from  opening  to  closing  of 
the  reduction.  Lt.  Colonel  Gallagher  declared  the  first  U.S.  ambi¬ 
guity  of  a  reduction  inspection  because  “the  43  T-55  main  battle 
tanks  were  not  presented  as  complete  assemblies.”  Gallagher’s

Polish  technicians  presented 
disassembled,  stacked  TLE  for 
opening  a  reduction  inspection. 


comments  reflected  the  U.S.  position  that  “complete  assembly” 
meant  an  assembled  piece  of  TLE.  Inspectors  could  not  determine 
whether  the  disassembled  parts  on  the  site  came  from  TLE  or  from 
a  collection  of  spare  parts.  The  Poles  responded  that  disassembling 
some  tank  components  and  stacking  them  allowed  for  more  effi¬ 
cient  transportation.  They  added  that  separating  components 
improved  the  results  of  the  smashing  destruction  method.  Despite 
the  ambiguity,  Gallagher’s  team  recorded  component  serial  num¬ 
bers  and  observed  the  smashing  of  tanks  for  three  days,  confirm¬ 
ing  that  the  Poles  had  reduced  all  43  tanks.  Later  in  the  reduction 
year,  Poland  changed  its  presentation  practice  and  presented  as¬ 
sembled  TLE. 

On  two  other  reduction  inspections  Lt.  Colonel  Gallagher 
encountered  circumstances  that  warranted  notation  on  inspection 
reports — one  was  only  a  comment,  the  other  an  ambiguity.  On 
March  17,  1993,  Gallagher  led  an  opening  reduction  inspection 
team  at  Szabadszallas,  Hungary.  During  the  inspection,  the  team 
recorded  the  serial  numbers  of  53  items  of  TLE  scheduled  for 
destruction  by  severing.  The  18  T-34  tanks  presented  for  reduction 
did  not  have  breech  blocks.  The  escort  team,  however,  provided 


Reduction  Years 


documentation  indicating  that  technicians  had  destroyed  86 
breech  blocks  at  the  Csepel  Iron  Works  on  July  19,  1989,  prior  to 
treaty  signature.  Gallagher  accepted  the  explanation  and  ended  the 
American  inspection  after  recording  a  comment  describing  the 
situation  in  the  inspection  report. 

Lt.  Colonel  Gallagher  recorded  an  ambiguity  during  an  open¬ 
ing  inspection  at  the  Military  Repair  Works  in  Trencin,  in  the 
Slovak  Republic,  on  November  24,  1993.  In  this  case,  technicians 
presented  38  OT-62  APCs  for  reduction  by  severing,  but  10  did 
not  have  machine  gun  turrets.  Gallagher  cited  the  treaty’s  provi¬ 
sions  for  presenting  a  complete  assembly.  The  Slovak  escort  team 
chief  responded  that  the  OT-62  was  also  produced  in  an  “A” 
model  and  that  only  the  A  model  had  a  turret.  Gallagher  coun¬ 
tered  that  the  exchanged  data  photos  for  the  OT-62  showed  a 
turret.  The  inspection  concluded  after  Team  Gallagher  confirmed 
the  destruction  of  three  APCs  to  include  two  of  the  APCs  that  did 
not  have  turrets,  leaving  the  rest  for  a  future  closing  inspection. 
The  JCG  later  approved  a  new  piece  of  TLE,  “OT-62,  without 
turret.”9 

Major  Marc  C.  Lieber,  USMC,  also  encountered  problems  at 
Trencin,  a  reduction  site  used  jointly  by  the  Czech  and  Slovak 
Republics,  involving  turrets  on  APCs  during  his  team’s  opening 
inspection  on  September  1,  1993.  In  recording  serial  numbers  for 
50  OT-64  APCs,  Major  Lieber  noted  that  six  of  the  units  were 
actually  OT-64A  models  that  had  no  turrets.  The  data  exchange 
photos  indicated  that  they  should  have  turrets.  Czech  escorts 
responded  that  technicians  had  removed  the  turrets  prior  to  treaty 
signature  as  part  of  a  modification  program  for  BMP-1  armored 
infantry  fighting  vehicles.10 

Lt.  Colonel  Lred  E.  Busing,  USAL,  declared  the  last  of  four 
ambiguities.  During  his  opening  reduction  inspection  on  March 
30,  1994,  at  Novy  Jicin,  in  the  Czech  Republic,  he  cited  the  re¬ 
quirement  for  complete  assembly  when  presenting  TLE  for  de¬ 
struction.  Czech  technicians  had  already  disassembled  15  T-55 
tanks  and  had  begun  disassembly  on  14  other  tanks.  The  required 
components  were  present  and  colocated,  but  not  assembled.  The 
Czechs,  like  the  Poles,  responded  that  all  components  were  avail¬ 
able  in  one  place  and  that  complete  assemblies  were  on  hand  but 
not  assembled.11  All  in  all,  during  the  110  reduction  missions,  U.S. 
team  chiefs  declared  only  four  ambiguities,  all  of  which  dealt  with 
the  standards  of  presentation. 


Eastern  Inspections 

One  U.S.  mission  highlighted  a  problem  that  other  NATO 
reduction  inspection  teams  had  encountered  earlier.  Major  Henry 
T.  Storey,  USA,  led  a  multinational  reduction  inspection  team  to 


213 


214 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


Trencin,  in  the  Slovak  Republic.  He  intended  to  conduct  a  closing 
inspection  of  50  OT-64s.  However,  upon  arrival,  he  learned  that  a 
Hungarian  team  had  already  inspected  and  confirmed  the  reduc¬ 
tion  of  44  of  the  APCs  nine  days  earlier,  on  September  28,  1993. 
The  NATO  team  had  no  definite  proof  that  the  Slovaks  had  re¬ 
duced  the  equipment.  This  situation  had  cropped  up  several  times 
earlier  in  the  reduction  period.  NATO  state  inspection  teams  were 
unable  to  confirm  the  reduction  of  TLE  because  Eastern  teams  had 
already  inspected  and  confirmed  the  reductions.  The  inspected 
nations  had  scrapped  the  destroyed  TLE. 

This  presented  a  problem  because  the  treaty  does  not  prohibit 
intra-group  reduction  inspections,  nor  does  it  place  quotas  or 
limits  on  reduction  inspections.  Some  of  the  Eastern  states  in  the 
post-Cold  War  era  were  just  as  interested  in  the  military  capabili¬ 
ties  and  holdings  of  neighboring  states  as  they  were  of  most  of  the 
NATO  states.  These  inspections,  however,  ran  counter  to  what  the 
NATO  states  viewed  as  a  basic  tenet  of  the  treaty,  that  each  group 
of  states  would  complete  its  reduction  obligations  within  40 
months  and  that  members  of  the  opposite  group  of  states  could 
confirm  all  reductions.  The  NATO  states,  however,  could  not 
verify  all  reductions  when  Eastern  states  conducted  reduction 
inspections  within  their  group  of  states. 

NATO  allies  were  concerned  about  lost  inspection  opportuni¬ 
ties  because  Eastern  nations  were  conducting  reduction  and  de¬ 
clared  site  inspections  within  their  group  of  states.  In  an  attempt 
to  curtail  these  East-on-East  inspections,  the  VCC  sponsored  a 
meeting  of  all  CFE  states  in  January  1993  to  discuss  the  intra¬ 
group  inspections  and  to  propose  a  plan  for  Cooperation  Partners. 
Under  this  plan,  the  VCC  would  continue  to  schedule  CFE  inspec¬ 
tions  for  the  NATO  states  but,  based  on  requests  from  Coopera¬ 
tion  Partners  for  specific  inspections,  the  VCC  would  also  coordi-

inspection. 


nate  the  placement  of  Eastern  inspectors  on  Western-led  teams. 
NATO  states  would  open  slots  on  their  inspection  teams  for  East¬ 
ern  inspectors  in  return  for  their  cooperation  in  not  leading  inspec¬ 
tions  within  their  group  of  states.  This  would  allow  the  NATO 
states  to  conduct  as  many  inspections  as  possible,  while  providing 
the  Eastern  states  with  inspection  opportunities  without  the  ex¬ 
pense  of  leading  an  inspection.  The  NATO  states  also  agreed  to 
share  all  reduction  inspection  data  maintained  in  a  database 
known  as  VERITY. 

In  addition  to  leading  reduction  inspection  teams,  individual 
U.S.  inspectors,  known  as  “singletons,”  participated  in  reduction 
inspections  led  by  other  NATO  nations.  This  allowed  U.S.  inspec¬ 
tors  to  participate  in  approximately  70  percent  of  the  reduction 
inspections.  Their  participation  in  these  inspections  provided  the 
U.S.  government  a  presence  and  firsthand  view  of  the  majority  of 
the  reduction  inspections. 


Declared  Site  and  Challenge  Inspections 
Continue 

Declared  site  and  challenge  inspections  continued  through  the 
reduction  years,  although  the  incidence  of  those  inspections  was 
not  as  frequent.  The  treaty  obliged  nations  to  receive  declared  site 
inspections  based  on  10  percent  of  their  declared  OOVs  during 
each  reduction  year.  By  contrast,  the  baseline  period  inspection 
rate  had  been  20  percent  over  only  120  days. 

OSIA  inspectors  conducted  16  declared  site  inspections  and 
two  challenge  inspections  during  the  first  reduction  year,  Novem¬ 
ber  1992  through  November  1993.  During  that  period,  team 
chiefs  declared  four  ambiguities,  site  access  being  the  common 
thread  in  all  four.  The  first  ambiguity  occurred  in  Belarus  at  Ma¬ 
rina  Gorka,  where  Team  Fiser  inspected  the  30th  Independent 
Mechanized  Brigade.  On  April  1,  1993,  Lt.  Colonel  Thomas  C. 
Fiser,  USA,  received  a  site  diagram  excluding  areas  of  the  military 
facility.  The  Belarus  escort  team  denied  the  American  team  access 
to  areas  that  were  within  the  military  facility  but  not  on  the  site 
map.  Fiser  declared  an  ambiguity  and  completed  his  inspection  of 
240  pieces  of  TLE  and  96  pieces  of  conventional  armaments  and 
equipment  subject  to  the  treaty  (CAEST).12 

Former  Major,  now  Lt.  Colonel  Keith  A.  Oatman,  USA, 
also  declared  an  ambiguity  when  he  led  an  inspection  team  at 
Baranovichi,  Belarus,  on  November  9,  1993.  He  received  the  site 
diagram  for  the  28th  Weapon  Combat  Vehicle  Storage  Base,  which 
excluded  areas  believed  to  belong  to  two  colocated  missile  brigades. 
The  Belarussians  had  not  declared  the  colocated  brigades  a  sensitive 
point,  nor  had  they  declared  them  OOVs.  Lt.  Colonel  Oatman 
requested  access  to  these  areas  but  the  Belarus  escorts  denied  the 


216 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


request.  As  was  the  case  in  Marina  Gorka,  Belarussian  officials 
stated  that  it  was  the  exclusive  right  of  the  inspected  state  to  deter¬ 
mine  the  boundaries  of  its  OOVs  and  declared  sites.  Lt.  Colonel 
Oatman  disagreed,  cited  the  treaty  definition  of  a  declared  site, 
noted  the  ambiguity,  and  continued  his  inspection  of  254  pieces  of 
TLE  and  57  pieces  of  other  treaty-reportable  equipment.13 

Lt.  Colonel  David  P.  Gessert,  USAF,  declared  an  ambiguity  in 
Ukraine  on  May  4,  1993,  while  inspecting  Ukrainian  army  forces 
at  Khmelnitskiy.  Lt.  Colonel  Gessert  announced  the  15th  Mecha¬ 
nized  Brigade  as  the  OOV  for  inspection.  During  the  inspection, 
Ukrainian  escorts  denied  Gessert’s  team  access  to  three  of  the 
15th’s  four  subordinate  battalions  on  the  site.  Lt.  Colonel  Gessert 
declared  an  ambiguity  and  completed  the  inspection.14 

On  July  14,  1993,  Major  Ronald  M.  Tait,  USAF,  and  his 
team  of  CFE  inspectors  arrived  at  Praslavice,  in  the  Czech  Repub¬ 
lic.  Before  inspecting  the  33rd  Tank  Regiment,  he  received  a  site 
diagram  that  depicted  the  OOV  as  being  the  entire  declared  site;  it 
did  not  include  any  other  area  of  the  military  facility.  The  Czech 
position  was  similar  to  the  early  Russian  position  during  mock 
inspections  and  baseline.  A  fence  around  the  OOV  delineated  the 
boundary  of  the  declared  site,  and  any  other  fences  beyond  that 
fence  served  a  different  purpose.  The  American  team  chief  noted 
the  ambiguity  and  finished  the  inspection.15 

The  number  of  declared  site  and  challenge  inspections  held 
steady  during  the  second  reduction  year.  OSIA  teams  conducted  17 
inspections,  14  declared  site  inspections,  and  3  challenge  inspec¬ 
tions.  One  of  those  inspections,  led  by  Lt.  Colonel  Fiser,  offered  a 
unique  opportunity  for  a  U.S.  CFE  inspection  team.  On  April  5,

1994,  Fiser’s  team  conducted  a  challenge  inspection  of  a  specified 
area  at  Arkhangelsk,  Russia.  What  made  the  inspection  unusual 
was  the  coastal  defense  and  naval  aviation  forces  stationed  within 
the  specified  area:  As  naval  forces  they  were  not  subject  to  de¬ 
clared  site  inspections  because  they  were  not  OOVs;  they  were, 
however,  open  to  a  challenge  inspection. 

During  the  second  reduction  year,  U.S.  teams  declared  only 
two  ambiguities.  Team  Tait  declared  the  first  on  February  1,  1994, 
at  Slutsk,  Belarus,  when  Belarussian  escorts  once  again  cited  a 
nation’s  exclusive  right  to  determine  the  borders  of  an  OOV.  The 
other  ambiguity  arose  on  August  22,  1994,  when  Lt.  Colonel  Kirk 
E.  Murray,  USA,  led  his  team  to  Odessa,  Ukraine.  Ukrainian  es¬ 
corts  limited  access,  citing  the  same  rationale  that  Belarussian 
escorts  had  espoused.16 


American  inspection  teams  conducted  15  declared  site  inspec¬ 
tions  and  one  challenge  inspection  during  the  third  reduction  year. 
Lt.  Colonel  James  Jubilee,  USAF,  documented  the  only  ambiguity 
during  these  inspections  at  Stryy,  Ukraine.  On  March  22,  1995, 
Team  Jubilee  inspected  the  10th  Aviation  Base  and  was  denied 
access  to  a  storage  area  that  was  within  the  outermost  fenced  area 
of  the  base.  The  Ukrainian  site  diagram,  however,  indicated  that 
the  declared  site  stopped  at  a  wire  fence  that  was  short  of  the 
storage  area.  The  escort  team  chief  enforced  the  declared  site  as 
depicted  in  the  site  diagram. 


Naval  forces  were  not 
OOVs. ..however,  they  were 
open  to  a  challenge 
inspection. 


During  the  reduction  years,  many  OSIA  inspectors  left  the 
European  Operations  Command  for  retirement,  change  of  duty 
within  the  agency,  or  a  change  of  assignment  away  from  OSIA.  To 
offset  these  losses,  new  personnel  arrived  and  trained  to  meet  the 
standards  required  of  OSIA  inspectors.  Despite  this  turnover,  U.S. 
inspection  teams  continued  their  operations  successfully,  inspect¬ 
ing  6  specified  areas  and  conducting  45  declared  site  inspections 
through  the  third  reduction  year. 


Multinational  Teams 

During  the  reduction  years,  the  composition  of  U.S.  inspec¬ 
tion  teams  changed.  Participation  by  allied  inspectors  on  U.S. -led 
teams  increased,  and  more  U.S.  inspectors  joined  allied  teams.  This 
reflected  a  U.S.  government  policy  decision  to  seek  more  inspec¬ 
tion  opportunities.  The  U.S. -led  inspections  with  allied  inspectors 
required  some  additional  preparations  to  familiarize  guest  inspec¬ 
tors  with  U.S.  inspection  techniques  and  to  train  them  in  specific 
tasks  as  members  of  the  team.  The  net  benefit  of  more  inspection 
opportunities  outweighed  the  additional  preparation  requirements. 

A  more  significant  change  to  team  composition  developed 
when  Eastern  inspectors  joined  NATO  nation  inspection  teams  on 
declared  sites  and  challenge  inspections.  As  discussed  previously, 


cx.  • 


218 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


the  NATO  states  extended  the  invitations  in  an  attempt  to  stem  an 
increasing  number  of  East-on-East  inspections.  The  first  inspection 
to  include  Cooperative  Partners  took  place  on  March  16,  1993, 
when  inspectors  from  Poland,  Hungary,  and  Azerbaijan  joined  an 
Italian-led  team  in  an  inspection  of  a  Romanian  declared  site.  The 
first  Eastern  inspector  to  join  an  American  team,  Lt.  Colonel 
Oldrich  Lacina  of  the  Czech  Republic,  deployed  with  Team  Fiser 
on  April  28,  1993,  on  a  successful  mission  to  Taszar,  Hungary,  to 
inspect  the  31st  Fighter  Regiment. 17 

Because  the  program  to  incorporate  Eastern  guest  inspectors 
into  NATO  teams  did  not  eliminate  East-on-East  inspections,  the 
NATO  nations  chose  to  send  Western  inspectors  to  join  Eastern 
inspection  teams.  The  United  States  government  was  reluctant  to 
participate,  fearing  that  doing  so  would  encourage  more  East-on- 
East  inspections.  In  May  1994,  U.S.  policy  changed;  OSIA  would 
send  U.S.  inspectors  to  join  Eastern  teams.  This  decision  allowed 
the  U.S.  inspectors  to  take  advantage  of  opportunities  that  other¬ 
wise  would  have  been  lost.  The  first  U.S.  inspector  to  participate 
on  an  Eastern  inspection  team,  Major  Marc  Lieber,  USMC,  joined 
a  Bulgarian-led  inspection  team  on  May  15,  1994,  on  a  mission  to 
inspect  Romanian  forces.  A  day  later,  Lt.  Colonel  Thomas  C.  Fiser 
participated  in  an  inspection  of  Ukrainian  forces  as  a  member  of  a 
Polish-led  inspection  team.

during  an  inspection  of  Czech  forces. 


Reduction  Years 


Lt.  Colonel  Gabor  Nagy  of  Hungary,  a  Cooperative  Partner  inspector,  served  on  a  U.S.  team 
at  Trencin,  Slovakia,  in  November  1993. 


One  inspection  that  dramatically  portrayed  the  changes  that 
had  occurred  in  Europe  and  in  the  implementation  of  the  CFE 
Treaty  took  place  in  September  1994.  Lt.  Colonel  Fred  E.  Busing, 
USAF,  led  an  inspection  team  to  Cazarma  Centru  Oradea,  Roma¬ 
nia,  to  inspect  the  21st  Mechanized  Battalion.  This  American-led 
inspection  team  was  a  milestone  of  sorts  because  it  included  Rus¬ 
sian  guest  inspectors  Colonel  Aleksandr  Petrovich  Kalinin  and 
Colonel  Gennadiy  Mikhaylovich  Savostyuk.  The  two  dominant 
forces  of  the  Cold  War  thus  pooled  their  resources  to  conduct  an 
arms  control  treaty  inspection.18 

The  United  States  received  only  nine  declared  site  inspections 
during  the  first  reduction  year.  A  Bulgarian  team  conducted  the 
only  inspection  of  U.S.  facilities  outside  Germany  during  a  mission 
to  a  POMCUS  (prepositioning  of  material  configured  to  unit  sets) 
site  at  Grobbendonk,  Belgium.  The  remaining  eight  inspections  all 
took  place  in  Germany.  The  second  year  brought  nine  more  in¬ 
spections  of  U.S.  forces,  eight  in  Germany  and  one  in  Italy.  During 
the  third  year,  OSIA  teams  escorted  seven  inspection  teams:  five  in 
Germany  and  one  each  in  Luxembourg  and  Italy.  The  issue  of 
ambulances  mounted  on  M-113  chassis  arose  several  times  during 
these  inspections.  Ukrainian  inspectors  wrote  a  comment  on  their 
report  concerning  this  type  of  ambulance  at  the  U.S.  Tactical 
Training  Center  at  Hohenfels,  Germany,  on  June  5,  1993.  The  U.S. 
escort  team  chief,  Lt.  Colonel  Jan  S.  Karcz,  USA,  denied  the  Ukrai¬ 
nian  inspectors  access  to  the  interior  of  the  ambulances.  Karcz  told

Colonel  Aleksandr  Petrovich  Kalinin,  a  Russian  inspector,  served  on  an  American  team  in 
Romania.  He  signals  all’s  well  after  the  plane  skidded  off  the  runway. 


them  that  the  ambulances  were  neither  armored  combat  vehicles 
nor  look-alikes,  and  therefore  were  not  subject  to  the  treaty.  The 
inspection  team  chief  did  not  declare  an  ambiguity,  but  com¬ 
mented  that  there  was  no  way  to  confirm  that  the  vehicles  were 
ambulances  instead  of  M-l  13s. 

Colonel  Lawrence  G.  Kelley,  USMC,  encountered  a  similar 
situation  while  escorting  Hungarian  inspectors  during  an  inspec¬ 
tion  of  the  Leghorn  Army  Depot  in  Livorno,  Italy,  on  June  21, 
1994.  Technicians  accidentally  had  left  the  doors  to  the  ambu¬ 
lances  open,  allowing  the  inspectors  to  observe  the  interior  of 
ambulances  that  had  not  yet  been  modified.  The  site  commander 
provided  the  Hungarian  inspectors  documentation  to  show  that 
conversion  kits  had  been  ordered,  but  had  not  yet  arrived.  The 
inspectors  ultimately  made  no  comments  on  the  inspection 
report.19 

During  the  reduction  period,  U.S.  inspection  teams  continued 
their  policy  of  strict  adherence  to  the  provisions  of  the  CFE  Treaty. 
They  exercised  their  inspection  rights  and  protected  U.S.  interests 
to  the  fullest.  Despite  encountering  problems,  U.S.  inspection 
teams  maintained  a  professional  relationship  with  their  counter¬ 
parts  while  attempting  to  resolve  those  problems.  They  incorpo¬ 
rated  new  team  members  from  different  nations  and  participated 
on  teams  from  other  nations.  They  displayed  flexibility  in  complet¬ 
ing  their  mission,  while  maintaining  high  standards.

Residual  Levels 

After  the  40-month  reduction  period,  how  had  the  situation 
in  Europe  changed?  What  remained?  Tables  7-3  and  7-4  list  the 
holdings  of  TLE  declared  by  each  state  at  the  end  of  the  reduction 
period.  They  also  show  the  net  change  in  holdings  from  July  17, 

1992,  to  November  17,  1995.  The  change  was  significant.  The 
two  groups  of  states’  combined  decrease  was  64,854  pieces  of 
TLE:  the  Eastern  nations  were  down  by  37,482  pieces  while  the 
NATO  states  dropped  27,372  items. 

Both  groups  were  below  the  treaty’s  ceilings  in  each  TLE 
category.  Several  states,  such  as  Turkey,  showed  increases  in 
equipment  because  their  national  ceilings,  agreed  upon  within

their  group  of  states,  were  higher  than  their  holdings,  allowing 
them  to  increase  their  forces  through  purchases  or  cascading. 

The  total  decrease  in  TLE  was  not  entirely  the  result  of  treaty 
reductions  or  a  need  to  fulfill  treaty-obligated  reductions.  While 
the  United  States  fulfilled  its  reduction  obligations,  it  also  with¬ 
drew  many  of  its  forces  from  Europe  for  political  and  economic 
reasons.  Some  nations — Russia,  Poland,  Ukraine — reduced  TLE 
beyond  their  required  liabilities  for  economic  reasons.  Other 
nations  exported  small  quantities  of  weapons. 

Iceland  and  Luxembourg  were  signatories  but  held  no  TLE, 
so  they  reported  none.  Georgia  and  Armenia  made  no  declaration 
at  entry  into  force,  and  Georgia  did  not  make  a  declaration  in 
November  1995.  Both  were  involved  in  fighting  during  the  period 
and  disputed  total  numbers  of  items  attributed  to  them  from  the 
Tashkent  agreement.

Chapter  8 


Verification  agency  leaders  gathered  at  RAF  Scampton,  England,  for  a  post-baseline  conference  in  December  1992. 


At  the  end  of  the  CFE  Treaty’s  third  reduction  year  in 

November  1995,  one  could  draw  six  conclusions.  First, 
the  treaty  ratification  process  had  been  critical  to  achieving 
national  and  international  consensus  on  the  detailed  treaty  provi¬ 
sions  and  protocols  that  were  so  important  throughout  implemen¬ 
tation.  Second,  three  years  into  the  process  of  providing  data, 
reducing  weapons,  accepting  inspection  teams,  and  adjudicating 
disputes,  the  30  signatory  states  remained  committed  to  the  CFE 
Treaty.  With  some  exceptions,  the  states  were  meeting  their  na¬ 
tional  reduction  quotas  in  the  treaty’s  five  categories  of  offensive 
weapons.  The  treaty  specified  that  100  percent  of  each  nation’s 
final  reduction  liability  had  to  be  achieved  by  the  end  of  the  third 


226 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


reduction  year.  Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  Georgia,  Belarus,  Ukraine, 
and  Russia  did  not  meet  their  treaty-mandated  reduction  quotas.1 
Of  these  states,  Belarus,  Ukraine,  and  Russia  had  informed  the 
Joint  Consultative  Group  in  Vienna  of  the  special  circumstances 
that  forced  them  to  postpone  the  date  for  completing  their  treaty 
reductions.  No  nation  indicated  that  it  would  withdraw  from  the 
treaty.  Despite  the  fact  that  these  six  nations  were  not  in  compli¬ 
ance  as  of  November  1995,  collectively,  the  nations  of  the  NATO 
and  WTO  alliances  had  met  and  even  exceeded  the  CFE  Treaty 
reduction  quotas.  By  November  17,  1995,  the  end  of  the  third 
reduction  year,  the  signatory  states  had  destroyed,  converted, 
decommissioned,  reclassified,  or  placed  on  static  display  more 
than  19,200  battle  tanks,  9,800  artillery  pieces,  18,600  armored 
personnel  carriers,  2,200  combat  aircraft,  and  370  attack  helicop¬ 
ters.  The  total — 50,170 — exceeded  the  reduction  quotas  estab¬ 
lished  in  the  treaty.2 

The  third  conclusion  was  that  the  CFE  Treaty’s  principal 
verification  measure — the  use  of  on-site  inspection  teams  to  con¬ 
firm  force  data  and  to  monitor  reductions,  recategorizations,  and 
suspect  sites — was  working  well.  National  on-site  inspection  teams 
had  conducted  more  than  2,500  inspections  of  declared  sites, 
objects  of  verification  (OOVs),  specified  areas,  and  reductions  of 
treaty-limited  equipment  (TLE).  Disputes  arose  in  fewer  than  50 
inspections.  Many  potentially  contentious  issues  had  been  resolved 
on-site  by  the  inspectors  and  escorts  acting  within  the  treaty’s 
articles  and  protocols. 


The  Hofburg  Palace  in  Vienna,  Austria,  was  the  meeting  place  for  the  CFE  Treaty’s  Joint 
Consultative  Group. 


227 


The  CFE  Treaty:  A  Durable  Structure  for  Post-Cold  War  Europe 


Fourth,  the  CFE  Treaty’s  Joint  Consultative 
Group  (JCG)  had  functioned  as  an  important 
forum  throughout  treaty  ratification  and  imple¬ 
mentation.  The  JCG  had  met  almost  continually 
in  Vienna  since  the  treaty’s  signature  in  Paris  on 
November  19,  1990,  to  consider  problems  aris¬ 
ing  from  national  force  data,  on-site  inspections, 
notifications,  and  other  treaty  requirements.  In 
closed  joint  sessions  and  committees,  representa¬ 
tives  of  the  treaty  states  discussed  and  formulated 
solutions  and,  on  many  occasions,  achieved  the 
required  consensus  on  recommended  changes  to 
treaty  issues.  Throughout  implementation,  the 
JCG  provided  the  CFE  Treaty  process  a  degree  of 
flexibility  that  was  invaluable  in  a  time  of  rapid 
changes  across  Europe. 


The  fifth  conclusion  is  that  the  political  and 
social  upheavals  sweeping  across  post-Cold  War 
Europe  from  1992  to  1995  had  a  direct  influence 
on  the  CFE  Treaty’s  implementation.  Within  a 
year  of  the  Soviet  Union’s  collapse  in  late  1991  The  JCG  approved  Russian  modified  reduction 
and  the  creation  of  the  new  successor  states,  procedures. 

Western  European  governments  and  peoples 
were  interacting,  formally  and  informally,  with  Eastern  European 
nations  to  a  degree  not  seen  for  50  years  or  more.  This 
activity  influenced  the  composition  of  the  CFE  Treaty’s  national 
inspection  teams.  In  January  1993,  just  six  months  after  the 
treaty’s  entry  into  force,  the  NATO  nations  collectively  invited  the 
treaty’s  Eastern  states  to  join  their  CFE  teams  as  guest  inspectors. 

They  accepted.  Shortly  thereafter,  individual  inspectors  from  the 
Eastern  states  began  serving  on  the  NATO  nations’  CFE  inspection 
teams.  These  multinational  teams  conducted  inspections  of  CFE 
sites  throughout  Eastern  Europe  and  the  successor  states.  Within  a 
matter  of  months  in  1993,  virtually  all  the  NATO  nations’  CFE 
inspection  teams  had  become  multinational,  with  inspectors  from 
several  nations  routinely  serving  on  a  single  team. 


The  rapid  thaw  after  the  Cold  War  was  reflected  in  other 
cooperative  efforts.  In  1994,  the  treaty  nations  agreed  to  share 
data  from  on-site  inspections  and  from  the  annual  national  force 
data  submissions.  At  that  time,  the  NATO  nations  expanded  VER¬ 
ITY,  their  computerized  database,  incorporating  information  on 
inspections  and  national  force  data  from  almost  all  treaty  states.  In 
another  development,  in  1993  NATO  opened  its  CFE  Treaty  train¬ 
ing  courses  to  inspectors  from  the  Eastern  states  and  successor 
nations.  Further,  NATO’s  Verification  Coordinating  Committee 
(VCC)  sponsored  special  seminars  each  year  from  1992  through 
1996  for  the  directors  and  senior  staffs  of  the  national  verification 
agencies  from  both  groups  of  states.  These  seminars  served  as

important  informal  forums  for  raising  implementation  issues,  and 
they  provided  a  setting  in  which  the  verification  directors  could 
discuss  common  issues  and  approaches.  When  the  CFE  Treaty  was 
negotiated  and  signed  in  1990,  no  one  had  anticipated  the  form  or 
the  extent  of  these  joint  East-West  treaty  implementation  activities. 

Finally,  one  could  conclude  that  collectively  the  30  CFE 
Treaty  states  had,  in  large  measure,  achieved  the  treaty’s  stated 
objectives  of  establishing  a  “secure  and  stable  balance  of  conven¬ 
tional  armed  forces  in  Europe  at  lower  levels”  and  eliminating  “as 
a  matter  of  high  priority,  the  capability  for  launching  a  surprise 
attack  or  for  initiating  a  large-scale  offensive  action  in  Europe.”5 
Certainly,  the  demise  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  of  the  Warsaw 
Treaty  Organization  as  a  viable  military  alliance  were  consequen¬ 
tial  events  that  contributed  directly  to  these  all-European  treaty 
objectives.  Yet,  one  should  not  discount  the  treaty  states’  concrete 
actions  in  carrying  out  their  CFE  Treaty  commitments.  In  1992, 
1993,  1994,  and  1995;  daily,  weekly,  yearly;  in  thousands  of  dis¬ 
crete  actions,  the  signatory  states  had  met  their  treaty  obligations 
and  exercised  their  treaty  rights. 

By  the  end  of  the  reduction  period  in  November  1995,  the 
CFE  Treaty  was  viewed  widely  across  Europe  as  a  valuable,  legally 
binding  agreement  for  reducing  military  armaments  and  for  en¬ 
hancing  openness  of  military  forces  across  national  borders.  Since 
it  entered  into  force,  a  durable  record  had  been  achieved;  that 
record  established  a  context  for  evaluating  the  CFE  Treaty’s  next 
major  phase:  the  residual  level  validation  period. 


RLVP: 

November  17,1 995- 
March  16,  1996 


Residual  Level  Validation  Period: 
November  1995  to  March  1996 

Following  the  40-month  reduction  period,  the  treaty  provided 
for  a  brief  120-day  phase  during  which  every  nation  had  the  right, 
under  the  group  of  states  quota  system,  to  verify  the  treaty-limited 
weapons  and  forces  possessed  by  the  nations  in  the  other  group  of 
states.  Based  on  the  number  of  OOVs  in  the  Eastern  group  of 
states  on  November  17,  1995,  the  end  of  the  reduction  period,  the 
NATO  nations  could  conduct  up  to  247  on-site  inspections  over 
the  next  120  days,  while  the  Eastern  group  of  states  could  conduct 
up  to  254  inspections.  Designated  in  the  treaty  as  the  residual  level 
validation  period  (RLVP),  this  phase  preceded  the  treaty’s  final 
stage:  the  residual  period.  That  final  period  would  be  of  unlimited 
duration,  with  compliance  monitoring  by  on-site  inspections  con¬ 
tinuing  indefinitely,  though  always  based  on  a  percentage  of  a 
nation’s  OOVs.  The  RLVP  was  an  important  period,  because  it 
allowed  states  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  other  treaty  nations’ 
postreduction  numbers  in  order  to  establish  a  basis  for  monitoring 
the  national  TLE  holdings  in  the  residual  period.4

The  CFE  Treaty:  A  Durable  Structure  for  Post-Cold  War  Europe 


This  RLVP  phase  resembled  the  treaty’s  baseline  period  in 
both  intent  and  duration.  Both  were  periods  of  intense  inspection 
activities,  with  the  treaty  allowing  inspections  by  the  group  of 
states  of  up  to  20  percent  of  all  declared  OOVs.  The  major  differ¬ 
ence  between  the  two  periods  lay  in  the  length  of  time  for  planning 
and  preparation.  The  CFE  Treaty’s  final  ratification  developed 
quickly  in  June-July  1992  as  the  states  decided  to  implement  the 
treaty  provisionally.  Entry  into  force  came  immediately  after  the 
Helsinki  Summit  on  July  17,  1992;  it  caught  some  nations,  espe¬ 
cially  some  of  the  newer  Eastern  European  republics,  by  surprise. 
This  element  of  surprise  was  not  part  of  the  treaty’s  RLVP  phase. 
All  treaty  nations  knew  that  RLVP  would  begin  on  November  17, 
1995,  and  end  on  March  16,  1996. 

These  dates  were  known  to  Colonel  Kenneth  D.  Guillory, 

U.S.  Army,  who  assumed  command  of  OSIA’s  European  Opera¬ 
tions  (EO)  Command  in  January  1995.  He  took  over  an  active, 
experienced,  145-person  inspection  command.  The  treaty’s  RLVP 
was  10  months  away,  but  he  initiated  an  intensive  planning  effort 
immediately.  Guillory  knew  that  the  process  of  inspecting,  escort¬ 
ing,  and  conducting  liaison  operations  would  be  the  same  as  dur¬ 
ing  the  baseline  and  reduction  periods,  but  he  recognized  that  the 
pace  during  RLVP  would  be  much  faster.  The  command  would  be 
called  upon  to  conduct  twice  as  many  inspections  in  120  days  as  it 
normally  did  in  an  entire  year.  On  the  escort  side,  U.S.  vulnerabil¬ 
ity  to  being  inspected  would  not  be  as  great  as  during  baseline.

On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


Since  1992,  thousands  of  U.S.  troops  had  been  withdrawn 
from  Europe  and  dozens  of  U.S.  military  bases  closed.  Conse¬ 
quently,  Colonel  Guillory  expected  that  the  56  U.S.  Army  and  5 
U.S.  Air  Force  OOVs  in  Europe  would  be  inspected  12  times  dur¬ 
ing  RLVP  (20  percent  of  61  OOVs).  Further,  Guillory  assumed 
that  American  liaison  officers  would  be  extremely  busy  during  the 
period,  since  the  NATO  nations’  passive  quota  was  254  inspec¬ 
tions.  United  States  policy  dictated  that  a  U.S.  liaison  team  travel 
to  every  site  subject  to  inspection  in  order  to  protect  U.S.  facilities 
and  units  stationed  or  deployed  there.  As  he  added  up  numbers  of 
inspections,  escorts,  and  liaison  missions  for  the  RLVP  phase, 
Guillory  concluded  that  the  command  would  be  doing  twice  as 
much  work  in  one-third  the  time.  To  ensure  the  command’s  readi¬ 
ness,  he  initiated  an  intensive  planning  effort  to  nail  down  every 
aspect  of  OSIA’s  RLVP  mission.5 

In  mid-February  1995,  Guillory  brought  the  European  Op¬ 
erations  Command  staff  together  and  explained  his  initial  plan¬ 
ning  guidance.  All  RLVP  planning  and  preparations  would  be  a 
joint  staff  effort  involving  operations,  support,  and  logistics.  Fur¬ 
ther,  the  effort  would  involve  extensive  coordination  with  Head¬ 
quarters  and  with  OSIA’s  operating  commands  and  consultation 
with  the  staffs  of  the  NATO  nations’  verification  agencies,  other 
foreign  verification  agencies,  and  NATO’s  VCC.  Finally,  he  di¬ 
rected  at  this  initial  meeting  that  the  effort  would  be  coordinated 
by  the  operations  division’s  planning  cell.  In  November  1995,  just 
as  the  RLVP  operation  was  getting  under  way,  Colonel  Guillory 
recalled  his  objectives.  “We  went  to  work,’’  he  explained,  “to 
develop  an  operational  concept  and  four  interlocking  plans.”6  This 
work,  he  said,  produced  the  following7: 

•  An  operational  concept  as  part  of  the  NATO  plan.  Since  the 
beginning  of  the  CFE  Treaty,  the  United  States  had  conducted 
its  treaty  responsibilities  in  concert  with  the  NATO  nations. 
This  would  continue  during  RLVP. 

•  An  aggressive  liaison  plan  to  ensure  an  American  presence  at 
any  U.S.  facility  in  the  NATO  nations. 

•  An  augmentation  plan  to  ensure  that  OSIA’s  EO  Command 
had  the  necessary  manpower  to  conduct  the  escort  and 
inspection  missions. 

•  A  logistics  plan  to  support  all  EO  inspectors,  escorts,  liaison 
officers,  and  augmentees. 

•  An  aggressive  training  plan  to  prepare  new  EO  members  and 
augmentees  for  CFE  Treaty  operations. 

As  the  planning  got  under  way  in  the  spring  of  1995,  Briga¬ 
dier  General  Gregory  G.  Govan,  Director  of  OSIA,  decided  that 
the  agency  would  augment  the  EO  Command  with  people  from 
Headquarters  and  the  other  operational  commands.  By  mid-

The  CFE  Treaty:  A  Durable  Structure  for  Post-Cold  War  Europe 


summer  the  plan  called  for  41  augmentees.  All  would  be  trained 
by  September  and  would  deploy  to  Europe  in  early  November. 
These  OSIA  people  would  serve  on  liaison  teams,  inspection 
teams,  and  escort  teams.  They  would  also  work  in  communica¬ 
tions,  planning,  and  administration.  As  the  date  grew  closer, 
Colonel  Guillory  reevaluated  the  command’s  requirement  for 
augmentees.  He  reduced  the  required  number  from  41  to  33, 
largely  on  the  basis  of  new  personnel  arriving  earlier  than  antici¬ 
pated  and  a  new  estimate  of  the  logistics  division’s  operational 
capability.  At  Rhein-Main,  three  officers — Lt.  Colonel  Thomas 
Carraway,  USA;  Lt.  Colonel  William  L.  Lefevers,  USAF;  and  Ma¬ 
jor  Jon  Rebholz,  Jr.,  USMC — played  key  roles  in  shepherding 
every  aspect  of  the  RLVP  planning  effort.  Just  as  Colonel 
Lawrence  Kelley,  USMC,  had  checked  and  rechecked  every  detail 
of  the  command’s  planning  prior  to  baseline,  these  three  officers 
forced  every  division,  section,  team,  and  individual  to  know  and 
understand  their  role  during  RLVP.8  What  were  the  results? 

During  the  residual  level  validation  period — from  November 
17,  1995,  to  March  16,  1996 — NATO  nations  conducted  246 
inspections  of  Eastern  bloc  nations.  The  United  States  led  38  in¬ 
spections  and  provided  guest  inspectors  on  56  other  national 
teams.  U.S.  inspection  teams  hosted  65  guest  inspectors.  During 
RLVP,  U.S.  inspection  teams  exercised  all  their  treaty  rights;  when 
appropriate,  they  wrote  comments  on  the  inspection  reports.  They 
declared  11  ambiguities,  which  were  referred  to  the  JCG  in  Vienna 
for  resolution.  As  in  every  other  period  in  the  treaty,  U.S.  inspec¬ 
tion  teams  and  inspectors  set  high  standards  in  their  knowledge  of 
the  treaty,  its  protocols,  TLE  status,  and  national  force  data.9 

From  November  to  March,  Eastern  nations  inspected  NATO 
nations  183  times.  This  tempo  was  somewhat  slower  than  ex¬ 
pected,  although  it  was  at  an  inspection  level  of  72  percent  of  the 
maximum  possibility  of  254  inspections.  Eastern  nations  used 
sequential  inspections  to  cover  as  many  sites  as  possible  in  a  single

Colonel  Kenneth  D.  Guillory,  U.S.  Army 

Colonel  Ken  Guillory,  U.S.  Army,  commanded  OSIA’s  European 
Operations  Command  during  the  RLVP  period.  A  field  artillery  of¬ 
ficer,  he  commanded  a  battalion  at  Ft.  Sill,  Oklahoma;  fought  in 
Operation  Desert  Storm  in  Saudi  Arabia ;  and  served  as  a  civil-military 
liaison  officer  to  the  German  army  under  the  US  Army’s  Pershing  II 
command.  Capable  in  German  and  Russian,  Guillory  holds  a  master’s 
degree  in  Soviet  area  studies  from  Georgetown  University. 


On  the  necessity  for  early  planning  for  the  CPE 
Treaty’s  RLVP  operations:  “We  started  the  plan¬ 
ning  process  in  February  1995.  We  used  the  basic 
joint  operations  planning  system,  which  is  similar 
to  the  Army’s  system.  We  did  it  not  because  it 
was  familiar  to  me,  which  it  was,  but  because  it 
tends  to  make  you  ask  the  right  questions  and  do 
the  kind  of  planning  that  you  need  to  do.  It’s 
deliberately  designed  to  expose  things  that  may 
be  weaknesses,  so  that  you  can  address  them  and 
take  care  of  them  in  your  planning.  The  other 
thing  that  we  did  that  was  important  was  to 
coordinate  all  key  issues  with  agencies  here  in 
Europe,  with  OSIA  Headquarters  in  Washington, 
and  with  the  Inspection  Support  Staff.  We  didn’t 
plan  it  just  as  operators,  we  had  logistics  people, 
personnel  folks,  counterintelligence  folks;  every¬ 
body  was  involved.  It  was  a  total,  coordinated 
effort.  I  think  it  made  a  big  difference.” 

On  the  difference  between  normal  operations  and 
the  tempo  during  RLVP:  “The  difference,  of 
course,  was  the  intensity  of  the  operation.  We 
were  doing  a  greater  number  of  inspections  in  a 
shorter  period.  What  made  the  operation  differ¬ 
ent  was  the  coordination  needed  to  get  people 
briefed,  transported  to  and  from  the  inspection 
site,  debriefed,  and  then  having  to  coordinate 
everything  with  several  other  nations  simulta¬ 
neously.  It  was  a  major  coordination  problem. 

“The  one  problem  that  you  try  to  plan  for,  but 
there  really  is  nothing  you  can  do  about,  is  the 
weather.  RLVP,  of  course,  happened  from 
mid-November  to  mid-March,  right  in  the  middle 
of  the  Russian  and  East  European  winter.  That 
made  it  hard.  The  difficulty  was  not  as  great  in 
the  East  European  countries:  Bulgaria,  Hungary, 
Romania,  Poland,  the  Czech  Republic,  and 
Slovakia.  There  ground  transportation  was  al¬ 


ways  available.  In  Russia,  however,  the  only  entry 
point  was  Moscow.  To  get  from  Moscow  to  the 
majority  of  the  CFE  Treaty  sites,  the  team  had  to 
fly.  That  presented  us  some  problems.  I  expected 
that  at  least  once,  if  not  more,  we  were  going  to 
have  trouble  reaching  a  Russian  site  in  time  to 
conduct  the  inspection,  simply  because  of  the 
weather.  And  that,  of  course,  was  out  of  our 
hands.  The  other  problem  was  that  it  was  really 
very  difficult  to  do  a  CFE  inspection  after  dark. 
You  needed  daylight.  In  the  winter  the  days  are 
shorter,  so  you  had  to  plan  the  inspection  to  cover 
all  the  areas  you  needed  to  cover  and  see  within 
available  daylight.  Our  inspectors  know  how  to 
do  it,  and  they’re  good  at  it,  but  it  is  just  more 
difficult  inspecting  after  August  or  September 
when  the  days  are  longer.” 

On  the  coordination  process  at  NATO’s  Verifica¬ 
tion  Coordinating  Committee:  “The  process  has 
several  steps.  First,  we  decide  which  NATO  coun¬ 
tries  get  what  percentage  of  the  available  inspec¬ 
tions  in  the  East.  Then,  we  decide  which  countries 
get  what  percentage  of  inspections  in  Russia,  in 
Ukraine,  in  Poland,  Belarus,  and  all  the  other 
countries.  Then  the  total  period  for  the  inspec¬ 
tions  is  divided  into  time  blocks.  A  block  is  one 
week.  Normally  we  do  52  blocks  in  a  year.  The 
RLVP  was  18  blocks.  Because  of  a  high  number 
of  inspections  we  had  to  do  for  three  countries — 
Russia,  Romania,  and  Ukraine — we  had  to  create 
subordinate  blocks.  There  was  not  just  Block  2, 
there  was  Block  2  Alpha,  Block  2  Bravo,  and 
Block  3  Alpha,  Block  3  Bravo,  and  so  on.  For  the 
other  nations,  each  block  remained  one  week,  so 
that  you  could  go  to  Poland,  Czech  Republic, 
Hungary,  or  wherever.  Once  that  got  settled, 
there  was  a  process  at  NATO  for  each  of  the 
countries  to  say,  ‘Okay,  I  want  to  inspect  this 
country  in  this  block.’  That  was  negotiated  and

The  CFE  Treaty:  A  Durable  Structure  for  Post-Cold  War  Europe 


visit  to  Western  Europe.  The  United  States  was  inspected  1 1  times, 
with  10  inspections  occurring  at  U.S.  facilities  in  Germany  and  1 
in  Italy.  OSIA’s  EO  Command  deployed  full  escort  teams  to  each 
site  to  conduct  the  foreign  inspection  teams  through  the  U.S.  facili¬ 
ties.  During  RLVP  operations,  the  U.S.  liaison  teams  deployed  on 
163  Eastern  nation  inspections.  They  provided  invaluable  assis¬ 
tance  to  U.S.  military  units  and  personnel,  particularly  in  Turkey, 
Italy,  and  Germany.10 

In  March  1996,  when  the  RLVP  ended,  Colonel  Guillory 
evaluated  the  American  effort.  He  developed  a  method  to  compare 
the  “expected'”  level  of  operations  with  the  “actual”  level.  Using 
pluses  and  minuses,  he  evaluated  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  in 
the  command’s  planning,  training,  operations,  logistics,  and  inter¬ 
national  coordination.  In  early  May,  Brigadier  General  Thomas 
E.  Kuenning,  Director  of  OSIA,  and  the  senior  staff  held  an  all- 
Agency  operations  conference  at  which  Guillory  briefed  his  analy¬ 
sis  of  U.S.  operations  during  RLVP.  The  operation  was  a  success, 
he  thought,  because  the  early,  intensive  planning  effort  had  defined 
the  requirements  and  had  produced  an  operations  plan  that  was 
comprehensive  and  realistic.  The  expected  and  actual  levels  of 
operations  matched  up  across  the  board,  except  for  a  few  minuses 
concerning  forecasting  efforts  that  had  been  unsuccessful  in  antici- 


deconflicted  as  each  country  presented  its  sched¬ 
ule.  Then  the  VCC  put  them  all  together  and  said, 
‘Okay,  here  is  where  there  are  conflicts,’  and  they 
worked  them  all  out.  So  NATO  came  up  with  a 
deconflicted  schedule.  Once  that  was  done,  the 
NATO  countries  went  back  and  decided  who 
would  be  guest  inspectors  on  their  teams.  In  our 
case,  for  example,  sometimes  we  had  a  German 
or  a  British  officer;  a  Frenchman  or  a  Dutchman; 
a  Belgian,  Italian,  Portuguese,  Danish,  or  Turkish 
officer.  Those  all  got  worked  out  in  advance. 

“Some  inspections  were  ‘paired.’  That’s  the 
term  we  use  for  inspections  when  we  take  repre¬ 
sentatives  from  our  Eastern  European  treaty 
partners.  In  some  cases  we  will  actually  have 
Eastern  officers  on  our  teams.  For  example,  we 
had  some  Hungarian  officers  with  us  on  an  in¬ 
spection  in  Romania.  There  is  no  quota  for  how 
many  times  we  do  it.  We  don’t  have  to  do  it  at  all, 
but  it’s  good  for  us.  It  helps  us  a  lot.  Also,  it  gives 
them  exposure  and  experience  in  working  with 
Allied  teams.  The  United  States  is  not  the  only 
country  that  does  this.” 


On  incorporating  an  analysis  of  the  CFE  Treaty 
baseline  experience  into  RLVP  operations: 

“When  we  did  the  original  plan,  we  did  the 
commander’s  estimate  portion  and  one  of  the 
things  we  looked  at  was  how  we,  at  EO,  had 
handled  the  baseline  operations.  What  we  found 
out  was  that  we  had  actually  handled  the  inspec¬ 
tions  pretty  well.  We  had  organized  the  teams 
properly,  we  had  the  right  number,  and  we  were 
able  to  conduct  virtually  all  of  the  required  in¬ 
spections.  Remember,  the  treaty’s  baseline  period 
was  in  the  summertime,  so  the  weather  was  a  lot 
better.  On  the  escort  side,  we  were  well  prepared, 
although  the  Eastern  states  did  not  inspect  us  as 
much  as  we  thought  they  would.  On  the  liaison 
officer  side,  where  we  went  to  the  different 
NATO  countries  every  time  there  was  an  inspec¬ 
tion,  there  were  problems.  During  baseline  we 
had  LNO  teams  standing  by  in  several  locations, 
and  it  was  a  waste  of  manpower.  It  wasn’t  the 
best  way  to  do  things.  For  the  RLVP,  because  of 
the  distance,  we  are  keeping  an  LNO  team  in 
place  in  Turkey,  with  the  rest  based  here  in  Ger¬ 
many.  We  have  more  flexibility  that  way.”

pating  other  nations’  inspection  activity.  On  the  plus  side,  Guillory 
gave  high  ratings  to  NATO’s  VCC  deconfliction  work  and  its 
coordination  of  guest  inspectors,  the  continuous  dialogue  among 
the  NATO  nations’  verification  agencies,  the  West-to-East  dia¬ 
logue  between  verification  agencies  planning  cooperative  missions, 
the  work  of  the  augmentees  from  OSIA  Headquarters  and  opera¬ 
tional  commands,  the  determination  of  the  U.S.  liaison  officer 
teams,  the  professionalism  of  the  Inspection  Support  Staff  and  its 
coordination  efforts  with  the  interagency  policy  community  in 
Washington,  and  the  early  planning  and  standardized  packages 
developed  by  the  command’s  logistics  experts.11 

In  the  end,  the  fact  that  there  were  many  more  pluses  than 
minuses  was  less  important  than  the  presence  in  the  command  of  a 
vigorous  planning  effort;  rigorous  training  standards;  extensive 
NATO  nation  coordination;  thoroughness  in  inspections,  escorts, 
and  liaison  teams;  responsiveness  in  logistics;  and  a  willingness  to 
conduct  an  honest  postoperation  evaluation.  Measured  in  this 
way,  OSIA’s  European  Operations  Command  demonstrated  that 
the  leadership  and  professional  standards  that  had  been  present  in 
the  execution  of  the  U.S.  CFE  Treaty  on-site  inspection  mission 
during  the  baseline  and  reduction  periods  had  continued  during 
RLVP. 


Problems  During  Treaty  Implementation 

In  the  implementation  of  any  multinational  treaty,  problems 
arise  as  a  result  of  changes  in  the  international  situation,  changes 
in  one  or  more  of  the  signatory  nations’  internal  conditions,  or, 
more  commonly,  differing  national  interpretations  of  treaty  rights 
and  obligations.  A  treaty  may  have  unresolved  or  ambiguous 
issues  embedded  in  the  text  or  protocols  that  come  to  the  fore  only 
during  implementation.  Implementation  of  the  CFE  Treaty  cer¬ 
tainly  proved  these  generalizations  true.  Five  problems  surfaced 
from  July  1992,  entry  into  force,  to  November  1995,  the  end  of 
the  reduction  period: 

•  Inspector  access  at  declared  sites. 

•  Cost  of  treaty-limited  equipment  (TLE)  reductions. 

•  Accounting  for  TLE  among  the  Soviet  Union’s  successor 
states. 

•  Destruction  of  Russian  TLE  located  east  of  the  Urals. 

•  Redefinition  of  the  treaty’s  zonal  restrictions  for  stationing 
weapons  in  the  flank  areas  of  Russia  and  Ukraine. 

Some  of  these  problems,  such  as  the  inspectors’  right  of  ac¬ 
cess  at  declared  sites,  resulted  from  complex  compromises  in  treaty 
definitions  during  the  final  weeks  of  negotiations.  Others  were  the 
direct  consequence  of  the  Soviet  Union’s  collapse  and  the  creation

of  eight  successor  states  that  subsequently  be¬ 
came  parties  to  the  treaty.  When  the  Soviet 
Union’s  massive  holdings  of  TLE  were  divided 
among  the  new  nations,  some  states  had  diffi¬ 
culty  accounting  for  all  the  equipment  trans¬ 
ferred  from  the  Russian  army.  Other  states  had 
problems  financing  the  destruction  of  their  excess 
weapons  and  equipment  under  the  treaty’s  proto¬ 
cols.  Finally,  in  the  period  following  the  breakup 
of  the  Soviet  Union,  some  successor  states  faced 
severe  internal  unrest,  such  as  ethnic  violence 
in  Chechnya  and  internal  disruptions  in  Georgia, 

Moldova,  and  Armenia.  These  internal  problems 
placed  pressures  on  the  governments,  which 
deployed  military  forces  to  suppress  the  unrest. 

The  movement  of  these  forces  and  their  weapons 
threatened  compliance  with  the  treaty’s  zone 
limits.  Some  nations,  specifically  Russia,  argued 
that  key  provisions  of  the  treaty  should  be  al¬ 
tered  to  accommodate  these  problems. 

to  Declared  Sites 

The  first  significant  problem,  inspector 
access  to  declared  sites,  arose  shortly  after  the 
treaty  entered  into  force  in  July  1992.  During  the 
initial  inspections,  Russian  escorts  routinely 
granted  inspectors  access  to  the  designated 
OOVs  but  often  denied  them  access  to  the  entire 
declared  site.  These  denials  occurred  also,  to  a  lesser  degree,  in 
Belarus  and  Ukraine.  In  mid-August,  Russia  and  all  other  treaty 
states  presented,  as  required  by  the  treaty,  a  revised  set  of  data 
charts,  listing  their  declared  sites,  OOVs,  units,  and  TLE.  For  most 
of  its  CFE  sites,  Russia  now  stated  that  all  its  OOVs  and  declared 
sites  had  identical  boundary  lines.  Previously,  Russia  had  stated  in 
its  treaty  data  submissions  that  it  had  many  declared  sites  (military 
bases,  garrisons,  or  installations)  containing  five,  six,  or  more 
OOVs  (regiments  or  brigades).  The  new  Russian  treaty  data  charts 
signaled  a  major  change,  one  that  had  the  potential  of  limiting  the 
CFE  inspection  team’s  access  while  on  site.  Also,  the  Russian  data 
charts  essentially  nullified  the  treaty’s  carefully  negotiated  compro¬ 
mise  on  the  inspection  team’s  right  of  access  to  inspect  both  the 
designated  OOV  and  the  declared  site. 

Among  the  NATO  nations,  the  United  States  was  most  insis¬ 
tent  on  challenging  what  it  believed  was  Russia’s  unilateral  reinter¬ 
pretation  of  the  treaty.  It  set  out  to  force  the  issue.  The  United 
States  sent  several  inspection  teams  to  Russia  to  conduct  Section 
VII  Declared  Site  CFE  Treaty  inspections.  These  teams  conducted 


Unrest  in  the  Soviet  Union  led  to  its  breakup  and  the 
addition  of  eight  new  states  to  the  CFE  Treaty.

inspections  of  the  OOVs  and  declared  sites,  and  in  the  process, 
they  insisted  on  their  treaty  right  to  inspect  the  entire  site.12 
France,  Germany,  and  Great  Britain  agreed  with  the  United  States. 
Their  inspection  teams  raised  the  issue  with  Russian  military  es¬ 
corts  and  site  commanders.  Only  the  United  States,  however,  de¬ 
clared  ambiguities.12 

While  inspectors  argued  and  documented  the  issue  of  inspec¬ 
tion  rights  and  inspectable  sites,  diplomatic  delegations  discussed 
the  problem  in  Moscow,  Washington,  and  major  European  capi¬ 
tals.  The  JCG  held  a  series  of  meetings  seeking  resolution.  In  late 
October,  Ambassador  Lynn  M.  Hansen,  U.S.  CFE  Treaty  Negotia¬ 
tor,  flew  to  Moscow  for  discussions  on  the  issue  with  senior  Rus¬ 
sian  diplomatic  and  military  officials.  In  those  meetings,  Russian 
officials  declared  categorically  their  intention  to  return  to  the 
original  treaty  interpretation  and  to  comply  with  the  CFE  Treaty’s 
definition  of  a  declared  site.14  Four  weeks  later,  in  its  December 
15,  1992,  data  update,  Russia  stated  that  it  had  431  OOVs  and 
299  declared  sites.  Subsequent  inspections  of  Russian  CFE  sites  in 
1993  and  1994  by  NATO  nation  teams  revealed  that  on  this  is¬ 
sue — the  inspection  team’s  right  of  access  to  the  declared  site  and 
the  common  areas — Russia  had,  indeed,  reverted  to  the  complex 
treaty  understanding  that  had  been  negotiated  and  ratified.15 

It  is  important  to  recognize  that  in  the  resolution  of  this 
treaty  problem,  the  process  worked.  Inspectors  raised  and  docu¬ 
mented  the  issue  on-site;  they  declared  ambiguities,  which  were 
recorded  in  the  legal  process  of  verifying  compliance  with  the  CFE 
Treaty.  Once  documented,  the  problem  was  examined  by  the  re¬ 
spective  national  verification  agency  directors  and  staffs.  Then 
senior  officials  in  Moscow,  Washington,  and  other  capitals  evalu¬ 
ated  the  issue  and  prepared  government  positions.  In  Vienna, 
national  representatives  to  the  JCG  presented  their  views  and 


237 


The  CFE  Treaty:  A  Durable  Structure  for  Post-Cold  War  Europe 


worked  in  committees  and  joint  sessions  on  a  resolution  accept¬ 
able  to  all  treaty  states.  In  this  case,  the  treaty  problem  was  caused 
by  a  change  in  Russia’s  designation  of  its  national  force  data.  It 
was  resolved  when  Russia,  challenged  by  the  United  States  and 
other  treaty  states,  decided  to  return  to  the  data  format  used  by  all 
other  signatory  states,  thus  acknowledging  the  original  intent  of 
the  treaty.  Once  the  data  were  in  the  correct  format,  inspectors 
could  confirm,  through  direct  observation  on-site,  that  the  site, 
unit,  and  nation  were  in  compliance  with  the  treaty. 


Cost  of  TLE  Reductions 

A  persistent  problem  of  a  different  nature  arose  shortly  after 
the  CFE  Treaty  entered  into  force.  Several  nations  complained 
publicly  and  in  treaty  forums  that  the  treaty’s  reduction  protocols 
required  destruction  methodologies  that  were  too  specific  and  too 
expensive,  given  the  thousands  of  weapons  and  pieces  of  equip¬ 
ment  that  had  to  be  reduced  within  the  treaty-mandated  40 
months.  They  suggested  less  costly,  alternative  methods.  Only  one 
month  after  the  treaty  entered  into  force  in  July  1992,  General- 
Lieutenant  Ivan  Oleynik,  Ukrainian  Deputy  Defense  Minister  for 
Armaments,  stated  publicly  that  destroying  T-54  tanks  was  too 
expensive.  To  destroy  one  tank,  according  to  General  Oleynik,  the 
Ukrainian  government  had  to  spend  over  7,000  rubles.  Destruc¬ 
tion  of  just  one  armored  personnel  carrier,  he  maintained,  would 
cost  over  4,000  rubles.  Under  the  CFE  Treaty,  Ukraine  was  re¬ 
sponsible  for  the  destruction  of  2,450  tanks,  2,222  APCs,  and  550

aircraft.  To  accomplish  this  work,  the  Ukrainian  government  had 
to  set  up  reduction  sites  at  Zhitomer,  Kiev,  Lvov,  Nikolayev,  and 
Kharkov.16 

Other  states  with  substantial  reduction  liabilities  agreed  with 
Ukraine.  In  December  1992,  Germany,  Russia,  and  Belarus  joined 
Ukraine  in  petitioning  the  CFE  Treaty’s  Joint  Consultative  Group 
to  consider  new,  less  costly  procedures  for  reducing  treaty-limited 
equipment.17  Russia  had  10  reduction  sites,  Germany  6,  and 
Belarus  4.  From  December  through  March,  the  JCG  discussed 
Ukraine’s  petition.  Then  in  April  1993,  Russia  invited  observers 
from  the  other  treaty  nations  to  witness  a  demonstration  reduction 
of  tanks  using  the  new  procedures.  At  a  military  base  outside  Saint 
Petersburg,  Russian  army  warrant  officers  demonstrated  how 
disabling  one  side  of  a  tank’s  drive  system — rather  than  two,  as 
prescribed  in  the  treaty — would  render  it  militarily  ineffective. 

They  also  demonstrated  that  making  partial  rather  than  complete 
cuts  would  effectively  disable  the  tank’s  major  components:  the 
turret  rings  and  gun  barrels.  At  this  demonstration,  representatives 
of  the  other  treaty  states  observed  the  recommended  modifica¬ 
tions,  and  in  Vienna,  following  discussions  and  comments,  the 
JCG  representatives  accepted  the  Russian  proposal.  The  new  pro¬ 
cedures  became  acceptable  ways  to  reduce  tanks  under  the  treaty.18 
Less  than  a  month  later,  the  JCG  agreed  to  a  German  proposal  for 
modifying  the  procedures  for  reducing  lightly  armored  vehicles. 
The  German  delegates  proposed  that  these  weapons  be  destroyed 
by  crushing  them  in  a  large  compactor.  Known  as  the  “cheese 
slicer”  or  “cookie  cutter,”  this  compactor  worked  well  in  field 
demonstrations.  After  further  negotiations  in  Vienna,  the  JCG 
approved  its  use  in  June  1993. 19 


Poland’s  eight-ton  ball  crushed  TLE  efficiently  and  economically. 


239 


The  CFE  Treaty:  A  Durable  Structure  for  Post-Cold  War  Europe 


Reduction  costs  caused  Belarus, 
Ukraine,  Russia,  and  Germany  to 
petition  the  JCG  to  modify 
reduction  procedures. 


Poland  had  a  large  reduction  liability  under  the  CFE  Treaty: 
1,120  tanks,  246  armored  combat  vehicles,  705  artillery  pieces, 
and  49  aircraft.  In  1993,  Poland  recommended  and  the  JCG  ap¬ 
proved  a  modification  of  the  treaty  protocol  for  destroying  artil¬ 
lery  pieces.  According  to  Colonel  Stanislaw  Malinowski,  Director 
of  the  Polish  Verification  Center,  the  new  method  called  for  a  very 
large,  heavy  steel  wrecking  ball  to  be  lifted  high  in  the  air  and 
dropped  on  the  weapons,  thereby  “smashing  the  gun  components 
until  they  were  visibly  cracked  or  bent.”  Colonel  Malinowski 
added  that  this  method  was  “not  very  costly”  but  was  “very 


efficient.”20 


Even  with  these  procedural  changes,  the  cost  of  reducing  the 
excess  TLE  was  a  burden  for  some  of  the  smaller  successor  states. 
Belarus  is  a  small  nation  of  10  million  people.  At  Tashkent  it  had 
received  a  large  portion  of  the  Soviet  Union’s  CFE  Treaty  conven¬ 
tional  weapons:  3,457  tanks,  3,824  ACVs,  1,562  artillery  pieces, 
and  390  aircraft.  Belarus’s  total  reduction  liability  was  more  than 
3,750  weapons.  To  destroy  these  treaty  weapons  within  the  40- 
month  reduction  period,  Belarus  set  up  reduction  centers  at 
Borisov,  Lesnaya,  Baranovichi,  and  Stankovo.  When  its  economy 
collapsed  in  1992-93,  Belarus  said  that  the  cost  of  carrying  out 
CFE  Treaty  reductions  was  excessive.  In  December  1992,  Belarus 
joined  Russia,  Ukraine,  and  Germany  in  petitioning  the  JCG  to 
modify  the  treaty’s  reduction  protocols.  In  June  1993,  Belarussian 
senior  officials  stated  that  the  government  was  under  such  finan¬ 
cial  pressure  that  it  might  not  be  able  to  meet  its  CFE  Treaty  re¬ 
duction  obligations.  General-Major  Viktor  Vakar,  Director  of  the 
Belarus  National  Agency  for  Control  and  Inspection,  raised  the 
issue  with  the  NATO  Verification  Coordinating  Committee  in 
November  1993.  Other  Belarussian  senior  officials  took  the  issue 
before  the  state  parties  at  the  Joint  Consultative  Group;  still  others 
raised  it  in  diplomatic  exchanges  with  the  United  States.  In  the 
latter  instance,  Belarus  requested  that  Nunn-Lugar  funds  be  obli-

program. 


gated  to  assist  it  in  its  CFE  Treaty  reductions.  Here  was  a  new 
problem.  Belarus  was  not  requesting  further  modifications  to  the 
treaty’s  reduction  protocols;  instead,  it  was  asking  for  direct  for¬ 
eign  aid  to  pay  the  cost  of  reducing  the  weapons.  Belarus  esti¬ 
mated  that  it  would  cost  $33  million  to  reduce  its  3,758  pieces  of 
CFE  Treaty  TLE.21 

When  the  United  States  did  not  respond  (to  avoid  setting  a 
precedent  of  paying  for  TLE  destruction  for  all  the  successor 
states),  Belarus  took  another  tack.  It  called  for  the  treaty  states  to 
set  up  a  voluntary  CFE  Treaty  Support  Fund.  Among  the  treaty 
nations,  only  Russia  and  Ukraine  actively  supported  establishing 
such  a  fund.  Nevertheless,  Belarus  kept  the  concept  alive.  In 
March  1994,  senior  government  officials  said  they  would  be 
forced  to  declare  a  force  majeure  in  further  treaty  reductions  if 
economic  conditions  did  not  improve.  In  late  March,  U.S.  Secre¬ 
tary  of  Defense  William  S.  Perry  stated  that  the  United  States 
would  commit  $5  million  each  to  Belarus  and  Ukraine  to  support 
their  CFE  Treaty  reduction  efforts.  At  the  same  time,  Perry  pointed 
out  that  Belarus  had  already  been  granted  $70  million,  and 
Ukraine  $270  million,  under  the  United  States’  Cooperative  Threat 
Reduction  Program.22 

This  action  was  sufficient  for  Belarus  to  continue  its  CFE 
reduction  program  through  1994.  Then  in  February  1995,  Presi¬ 
dent  Aleksander  R.  Lukashenko  suddenly  announced  that  Belarus 
would  suspend  all  reduction  efforts.  Declaring  that  the  cost  of 
destroying  the  CFE  weapons  was  “economically  unjust,” 
Lukashenko  said  that  he  had  made  a  unilateral  decision  to  shut 
down  the  reduction  operations.  Here  was  a  direct  threat  to  treaty 
compliance.  Lukashenko’s  announcement  came  a  few  weeks  before 
Russian  President  Boris  Yeltsin  threatened  to  pull  out  of  the  treaty 


241 


The  CFE  Treaty:  A  Durable  Structure  for  Post-Cold  War  Europe 


if  Russia  did  not  receive  some  relief  from  the  treaty’s  flank  limit 
restrictions  and  if  NATO  expanded  into  Central  Europe.23 

Lukashenko’s  announcement  and  Yeltsin’s  threat  had  the  effect 
of  forcing  this  problem  out  of  treaty  forums  and  into  the  realm  of 
international  politics.  Resolution  of  Russia’s  flank  limit  problem 
will  be  discussed  later;  resolving  Belarus’s  financial  problem  took 
more  than  15  months.  Within  a  few  days  of  Lukashenko’s  February 
23,  1995,  announcement,  Deputy  Foreign  Minister  Valeriy  Tsepkalo 
explained  that  Belarus  was  prepared  to  resume  destruction  of 
weapons  if  sufficient  funding  was  forthcoming  immediately.  When 
no  other  nation  came  forth  with  funds,  Belarus  continued  its  sus¬ 
pension  throughout  the  spring,  summer,  and  into  the  fall  months. 
The  CFE  Treaty’s  November  17,  1995,  reduction  deadline  ap¬ 
proached;  nations  with  excessive  TLE  would  not  be  in  compliance. 
In  late  August,  German  Defense  Minister  Klaus  Kinkel  flew  to 
Minsk  and  discussed  the  issue  with  the  Belarussian  president  and 
his  ministers.  As  he  left,  the  German  defense  minister  made  no 
commitments,  but  he  conceded  that  the  Cold  War’s  termination 
had  created  great  suffering  for  Belarus  and  the  other  successor 
nations. 

In  September  1995,  Belarus  announced  that  it  would  resume 
its  reduction  activities  but  indicated  that  for  economic  reasons  it 
would  not  meet  its  treaty  reduction  obligations.  The  following 
month,  James  Collins,  Advisor  to  the  U.S.  Secretary  of  State,  flew 
to  Minsk  for  consultations.  No  direct  action  followed  until  No¬ 
vember,  when  the  deadline  came  for  all  treaty  states  to  meet  their 
reduction  liabilities.  On  November  17,  1995,  all  30  nations  issued 
a  joint  statement  from  Vienna  identifying  nations  that  were  not  in 
compliance  with  the  treaty.  Belarus  was  not  in  compliance.  Appar¬ 
ently  this  statement  and  the  promise  of  the  United  States  and 
Germany  to  provide  financial  assistance  were  sufficient  motivation 
for  Belarus  to  commit  to  a  definite  plan  for  completing  its  TLE 
reductions.  Ten  days  after  Belarus  was  singled  out  for  noncompli- 
ance,  its  representatives  submitted  a  plan  to  the  JCG  for  destroy¬ 
ing  all  of  the  state’s  remaining  TLE  by  April  26,  1996.  The  plan 
was  quickly  approved,  and  the  pace  of  reductions  proceeded  to 
meet  the  schedule.  Belarus,  in  fact,  did  not  meet  the  April  1996 
deadline,  which  meant  that  it  was  still  not  in  full  compliance  with 
the  CFE  Treaty’s  reduction  quotas.24 


Accounting  for  TLE  Among  the 
Successor  States 

Eight  signatory  states — Russia,  Belarus,  Ukraine,  Georgia, 
Moldova,  Azerbaijan,  Armenia,  and  Kazakstan — did  not  exist  as 
nations  during  CFE  Treaty  negotiations.  Following  the  collapse  of 
the  Soviet  Union,  these  states  received  portions  of  its  vast  arsenal 


242 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


in  the  Tashkent  Agreement  of  May  1992.  During  ratification,  they 
committed  to  the  CFE  Treaty’s  provisions  and  protocols.  However, 
when  it  came  time  for  implementation,  some  of  the  successor 
states  found  it  difficult  to  meet  their  treaty  commitments.  The 
situation  in  the  Transcaucasian  region  was  chaotic.  Nations  were 
ensnared  in  a  web  of  civil  wars,  revolutions,  ethnic  conflicts,  and 
internal  governmental  chaos.  Implementing  the  CFE  Treaty  was 
not  a  pressing  commitment  for  these  states.  To  complicate  matters, 
the  Russian  army,  which  had  inherited  the  USSR’s  forces  and 
equipment  before  Tashkent,  was  now  withdrawing  from  some 
parts  of  the  region.  Under  the  Tashkent  Agreement,  the  Russian 
army  was  responsible  for  turning  over  to  the  other  successor  states 
their  “agreed-upon”  portion  of  the  former  USSR’s  arsenal.  Under 
the  CFE  Treaty,  those  nations  would  be  responsible  for  the  treaty- 
limited  equipment  and  for  destroying  excess  weapons.  However, 
much  of  the  Russian  army’s  military  equipment  in  the  Trans¬ 
caucasian  region  was  old  and  unusable.  When  transferred,  it  was 
rejected.  This  rejection,  which  included  several  hundred  tanks, 
ACVs,  and  artillery  pieces,  caused  problems  for  the  other  signa¬ 
tory  states  monitoring  compliance  with  the  CFE  Treaty. 

In  the  Transcaucasian  region,  all  three  states — Armenia, 
Azerbaijan,  and  Georgia — experienced  major  difficulties  in  com¬ 
plying  with  the  CFE  Treaty.  When  the  treaty  entered  into  force  in 
July  1992,  Armenia  reported  almost  no  data  on  its  conventional 
equipment,  despite  having  been  authorized  at  Tashkent  258  tanks, 
641  ACVs,  357  artillery  pieces,  and  7  helicopters.  Furthermore, 
Armenia  did  not  admit  to  the  JCG  that  it  had  any  reduction  liabili¬ 
ties  in  the  first  or  second  treaty  reduction  years.  In  January  1993, 
Armenia  did  submit  its  TLE  listings,  but  it  stated  that  some  of  the 


Abandoned  TLE  presented  accountability  problems  in  the  Transcaucasus  nations. 


243 


The  CFE  Treaty:  A  Durable  Structure  for  Post-Cold  War  Europe 


In  November  1 992,  an  American  team  conducted  a  declared  site  inspection  in  Azerbaijan. 


CFE  equipment  left  by  the  departing  Russian  army  lacked  parts, 
critical  elements,  and  functioning  units.  Armenia  implied  that  it 
would  not  account  for  or  reduce  this  unacceptable  CFE  equip¬ 
ment.  Russia,  in  its  CFE  Treaty  charts,  had  reported  the  equipment 
as  transferred  to  Armenia.  However,  Armenia,  on  its  treaty  charts, 
did  not  report  the  same  numbers.  This  caused  a  discrepancy, 
which  the  JCG  discussed  but  could  not  resolve. 

Azerbaijan,  when  the  treaty  entered  into  force,  submitted  its 
TLE  data,  but  they  were  incomplete  and  inaccurate.  The  problem 
with  the  Azerbaijani  data  stemmed  from  the  same  cause:  the  de¬ 
parting  Russian  army  had  left  tanks,  ACVs,  and  artillery  that  were 
in  such  poor  shape  or  so  stripped  down  that  Azerbaijan  refused  to 
accept  and  account  for  them.  In  addition,  the  Azerbaijanis  were 
involved  in  a  lengthy  ethnic  war  in  Nagorno-Karabakh,  and  they 
asserted  that  losses  of  conventional  equipment  in  that  conflict 
could  not  be  accounted  for  or  reported.  Azerbaijan  did  accept  one 
U.S.  CFE  inspection  team  in  November  1992,  thus  indicating  a 
certain  willingness  to  participate  in  the  treaty.  But  Azerbaijan  did 
not  report  any  CFE  equipment  or  weapons  reduction  liabilities  to 
the  JCG  as  required  at  the  end  of  either  the  first  or  the  second 
treaty  reduction  year.  Georgia,  as  a  new  nation,  had  major  prob¬ 
lems.  An  intense  civil  war  threatened  the  existence  of  the  govern¬ 
ment.  Under  these  circumstances,  Georgia’s  compliance  with 
the  CFE  Treaty  was  problematical.  At  the  end  of  the  third  reduc¬ 
tion  year,  the  JCG  issued  a  statement  declaring  that  Armenia, 
Azerbaijan,  and  Georgia  were  not  in  compliance  with  the  treaty.2’ 

Ukraine  and  Russia  were  also  not  in  compliance  with  the 
CFE  Treaty.  They  did  not  meet  their  quotas  for  reducing  excess 
treaty-limited  equipment  assigned  to  the  Black  Sea  Fleet’s  naval 
infantry  and  coastal  defense  units.  This  treaty  problem  was  part  of 


244 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


a  much  larger  issue:  the  Black  Sea  Fleet’s  partition  by  Russia  and 
Ukraine.  At  Tashkent,  Russia  agreed  to  cede  to  Ukraine  a  certain 
portion  of  the  former  Soviet  Union’s  weapons,  units,  and  sites. 
Since  these  weapons  fell  under  the  numerical  and  zone  restrictions 
of  the  CFE  Treaty,  Ukraine  agreed  in  its  articles  of  ratification  to 
reduce  any  excess  TLE  within  40  months  of  entry  into  force.  As  of 
November  17,  1995,  Ukraine  was  in  compliance  with  all  its  treaty 
reduction  quotas,  except  for  the  weapons  and  units  assigned  to  the 
Black  Sea  Fleet.  In  1995,  the  fleet  had  approximately  48,000  naval 
and  marine  personnel,  14  submarines,  31  surface  ships,  43  patrol 
and  coastal  ships,  125  combat  aircraft,  and  85  helicopters.  Equip¬ 
ment  covered  by  the  CFE  Treaty  included  one  coastal  defense 
division  with  175  tanks,  450  armored  infantry  fighting  vehicles, 
and  72  artillery  pieces.  The  fleet  also  contained  a  naval  infantry 
brigade  with  50  tanks,  218  ACVs,  and  45  artillery  pieces.  Based  in 
the  Odessa  Military  District  in  the  Crimea,  this  fleet  was  manned 
predominantly  by  Russian  sailors  and  officers.  The  fleet’s  Russian 
commander  and  its  senior  officers  resisted  any  partition  and  trans¬ 
fer  to  Ukraine.26 

Partitioning  the  fleet  proved  to  be  to  difficult  at  Tashkent; 
consequently,  the  issue  was  left  to  bilateral  Russian-Ukrainian  nego¬ 
tiations.  In  June  1993,  Ukrainian  President  Leonid  Kravchuk  and 
Russian  President  Boris  Yeltsin  signed  an  agreement  that  essentially 
split  the  fleet  in  half,  beginning  in  September  1993  and  reaching 
completion  in  1996.  No  sooner  had  this  agreement  been  announced 
than  it  fell  apart.  Russian  naval  officers  objected  to  any  transfer,  and 
Ukrainian  military  leaders  objected  to  any  loss  of  territory  from  the 
naval  bases  slated  for  transfer.  The  Black  Sea  Fleet  agreement  was 
renegotiated  in  September  1993,  again  in  April  1994,  and  once 
again  in  February  1996.  Two  months  later  it  fell  apart  again.  Rus¬ 
sian  Defense  Minister  Pavel  Grachev  stopped  the  division  because  of 
controversy  over  where  the  Russian  fleet  would  be  based.  Through-

out  these  indecisive  negotiations  and  inconclusive  agreements,  nei¬ 
ther  Ukraine  nor  Russia  destroyed  any  of  the  weapons  or  equipment 
assigned  to  the  naval  infantry  and  coastal  defense  units  of  the  Black 
Sea  Fleet.  Consequently,  the  two  nations  were  not  in  compliance 
with  the  CFE  Treaty,  and  until  the  fleet  had  been  divided  success¬ 
fully,  they  would  remain  in  that  status. ^ 


Destruction  Commitments  East  of 
the  Urals 

In  1990,  during  the  final  months  of  CFE  Treaty  negotiations, 
the  Soviet  Union  transferred  more  than  50,000  pieces  of  TLE  to 
military  bases  and  depots  east  of  the  Ural  Mountains.  This  was  a 
legal  movement  of  military  equipment,  since  neither  the  Soviet 
Union  nor  any  other  nation  had  signed  the  unfinished  treaty.  Nev¬ 
ertheless,  once  the  treaty  was  signed  in  Paris  in  November  1990, 
the  Soviet  Union’s  initial  TLE  figures  disturbed  the  other  treaty 
states.  They  were  concerned  with  the  sheer  size  of  the  transfers, 
and  some  observers  concluded  that  the  Soviet  military  might  be 
trying  to  circumvent  the  treaty,  since  no  other  nation  had  trans¬ 
ferred  any  conventional  weapons  or  equipment  outside  its  borders. 
At  the  time  of  the  treaty’s  signature  in  Paris,  the  Soviet  Union’s 
data  revealed  a  transfer  of  6,289  CFE  Treaty  TLE  items  to  units  of 
the  naval  infantry,  coastal  defense,  civil  defense,  and  Strategic 
Rocket  Forces.  This  transfer  was  considered  a  serious  breach  of 
the  treaty — so  serious  that  many  nations,  including  the  United 
States,  suspended  ratification  actions  until  the  Soviet  Union 
pledged  to  account  for  and  destroy  a  large  portion  of  the  trans¬ 
ferred  equipment. 

As  explained  in  Chapter  3,  “Ratification  Delayed,”  intense 
diplomatic  negotiations  led  the  Soviet  Union  to  pledge  in  a  legal 
declaration  to  the  Joint  Consultative  Group  in  June  1991  that  it 
would  destroy  or  convert  6,000  tanks,  7,000  artillery  pieces,  and 
1,500  ACVs  (14,500  total)  located  east  of  the  Urals  by  December 
31,  1995.  At  the  same  time,  the  Soviet  Union  obligated  itself  to 
remove  from  the  treaty’s  territorial  zones  1,492  pieces  of  naval- 
related  equipment.  This  equipment  would  also  be  destroyed  by  the 
end  of  1995.  None  of  the  reductions  would  be  subject  to  inspec¬ 
tion;  however,  Moscow  pledged  to  provide  sufficient  visible  evi¬ 
dence  to  indicate  that  the  equipment  had  been  destroyed  or 
converted. 2S 

During  the  CFE  Treaty’s  40-month  reduction  period,  the 
treaty  states  individually  monitored  Russia’s  progress  in  keeping 
its  pledge  to  reduce  its  TLE  east  of  the  Urals.  There  was  little 
reduction  activity  in  1992-93;  only  a  slight  increase  in  1993-94; 
and  a  steady  low  state  in  1994-95.  In  January  1995,  the  U.S. 
Congress  was  informed  in  a  published  Arms  Control  and  Disarma- 


246 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


ment  Agency  (ACDA)  report  that  “serious  concern  persists  over 
the  pace  and  validation  of  the  [Russian]  reductions.”  In  July  1995, 
the  agency  raised  the  issue  before  Congress  again,  criticizing 
Russia’s  slow  pace  of  destruction  or  conversion.24  Then,  just  six 
weeks  before  the  December  31,  1995,  deadline,  Russian  General 
Dmitri  Kharchenko  announced  to  the  JCG  that  Russia  would  be 
unable  to  meet  its  commitments,  citing  the  expense  of  reducing 
such  a  large  number  of  conventional  weapons.  He  asked  for  an 
extension  to  December  1998.  General  Kharchenko  discounted  any 
military  threat  from  the  massed  equipment,  stating  that  weather 
exposure  and  lack  of  maintenance  had  rendered  it  effectively 
useless.30 

Russia’s  request  was  discussed  in  the  JCG  in  Vienna,  but 
there  was  no  agreement.  However,  in  May  1996,  at  the  CFE 
Treaty  Review  Conference,  all  the  signatory  states  accepted  a  new 
Russian  declaration  on  the  issue.  In  that  conference’s  Final  Docu¬ 
ment  (see  Appendix  D),  Russia  declared  that  it  would  proceed 
with  reductions  of  all  the  committed  weapons  and  equipment  and 
would  provide  documentary  evidence  of  its  destruction  and  con¬ 
version.  All  battle  tanks  and  armored  combat  vehicles  that  had 
been  exposed  to  the  weather  would  be  displayed  with  the  “hatches 
and  covers  of  engines”  opened.  A  group  of  experts,  at  their  own 
expense,  would  be  invited  to  the  reduction  sites  to  examine  the 
equipment  prior  to  its  final  disposal  through  scrapping.  Finally, 
Russia  established  the  year  2000  as  the  new  deadline  for  complet¬ 
ing  all  reductions  east  of  the  Urals.31 

Redefining  the  Treaty’s  Flank  Limits 

The  problem  of  the  treaty’s  flank  limits  was  both  consequen¬ 
tial  and  controversial.32  During  negotiations  the  treaty  states  ac¬ 
cepted  a  two-part  flank  zone  that  contained  limits  on  the  number 
of  active  and  stored  conventional  weapons.  In  the  diplomatic  end 
game  leading  to  treaty  signature,  President  Gorbachev  and  the 
Soviet  Union  accepted  these  zone  limits  and  restrictions.  The  CFE 
Treaty’s  Article  V  stipulated  that  each  group  of  states  could  pos¬ 
sess  no  more  than  4,700  tanks,  6,000  artillery  pieces,  and  5,900 
ACVs  in  the  flank  zones.  Originally,  the  flank  zones  included  the 
following  national  territories:  Iceland,  Norway,  Greece,  and  parts 
of  Turkey  (NATO  flanks)  and  Romania,  Bulgaria,  and  four  mili¬ 
tary  districts  in  the  Soviet  Union  (WTO  flanks).  For  the  Warsaw 
Treaty  Organization,  these  military  districts  were  located  on  the 
northern  and  southern  flanks  of  the  alliance  (see  table  8-1).  The 
intent  of  treaty  negotiators  was  to  limit,  through  absolute  numeri¬ 
cal  ceilings  and  storage  and  active  sublimits,  the  number  of  offen¬ 
sive  weapons  in  these  military  districts.

In  1990,  when  the  Soviet  Union  accepted  these  flank  zone 
limitations,  no  one  anticipated  the  nation’s  collapse  in  1991  and 
the  emergence  of  15  new  states  so  quickly.  During  the  first  six 
months  of  1992,  Russia  agreed  to  partition  the  former  Soviet 
Union’s  military  forces  and  to  ratify  the  CFE  Treaty,  including  its 
flank  zone  restrictions.  The  treaty  entered  into  force  on  July  17, 
1992;  on-site  inspections  began  immediately,  and  all  the  treaty’s 
provisions  were  in  effect.  Under  Article  V,  Russia  was  allowed  to 
have  approximately  10  percent  of  its  total  treaty  entitlements  in 
the  northern  and  southern  flank  zones  in  active  units;  more  than 
85  percent  had  to  be  placed  in  storage.  These  treaty  restrictions  on

Russia’s  conventional  force  deployments  irritated  senior  military 
leaders.  Only  Ukraine  had  similar  restrictions.  In  June  1993,  Rus¬ 
sian  Minister  of  Defense  Grachev  declared  categorically  that  the 
CFE  Treaty’s  flank  limits  had  to  be  revised.  Grachev  said  the  Rus¬ 
sian  general  staff  needed  to  remove  400  tanks,  2,420  ACVs,  and 
820  artillery  pieces  from  the  flank  limits  in  order  to  field  an  addi¬ 
tional  mechanized  division.33 

In  September  1993,  President  Boris  Yeltsin  sent  a  letter  to  the 
heads  of  state  of  the  United  States,  Germany,  France,  and  Great 
Britain  requesting  that  they  recognize  the  CFE  Treaty’s  flank  limits 
as  a  serious  problem.  Yeltsin  asked  for  assistance  in  Russia’s  ef¬ 
forts  to  modify  the  treaty.  Ten  days  later,  Russian  Ambassador 
Vyacheslav  Kulebyakin  presented  a  diplomatic  demarche  to  all 
CFE  Treaty  states.  Specifically,  Kulebyakin  asked  that  the  Joint 
Consultative  Group  consider  raising  Russia’s  flank  sublimits  in  the 
Leningrad  Military  District  and  in  the  Northern  Caucasus  Military 
District.  In  Vienna,  Ukraine  supported  Russia  on  this  issue,  since 
the  CFE  flank  rule  required  the  Ukrainian  army  to  base  60  percent 
of  its  forces  on  40  percent  of  its  territory.  Ambassador  Kulebyakin 
explained  that  “generally  recognized  common  norms  of  interna¬ 
tional  law  provide  for  a  possibility  of  suspending  the  effects  of 
treaty  obligations  due  to  a  radical  change  of  circumstances....”  He 
argued  that  the  internal  situation  in  the  Northern  Caucasus  region 
warranted  altering  the  CFE  Treaty’s  flank  limits.34 

The  other  CFE  states  did  not  respond  formally  to  the  Russian 
and  Ukrainian  requests.  NATO  nations,  in  the  main,  preferred  the 
status  quo.  They  indicated  that  while  the  treaty  was  being  imple¬ 
mented,  they  would  not  support  any  changes  in  the  negotiated  and 


249 


The  CFE  Treaty:  A  Durable  Structure  for 


ratified  treaty.  Two  NATO  nations,  Turkey  and  Norway,  objected 
more  strongly.  Both  nations  bordered  the  Russian  military  districts 
in  question.  Turkish  Foreign  Minister  Hikmet  Cetin  publicly  stated 
that  modifying  the  CFE  Treaty  would  both  interrupt  its  implemen¬ 
tation  and  open  up  the  possibility  of  an  arms  race  in  the  Caucasus. 
Leaders  of  other  NATO  nations  expressed  their  concerns  about 
reopening  the  treaty,  suggesting  that  some  Eastern  European  na¬ 
tions — Poland,  Hungary,  Slovakia,  and  the  Czech  Republic — did  not 
like  the  current  treaty-mandated  restrictions  on  stored  weapons. 
Given  this  opposition,  no  other  CFE  Treaty  state  stepped  forward  in 
the  fall  and  winter  of  1993-94  to  support  the  Russian  and  Ukrai¬ 
nian  request  to  reconsider  the  CFE  Treaty’s  flank  limits.35 

Russia,  however,  did  not  let  the  issue  die.  In  February  1994, 
two  Russian  general  staff  officers,  General  Dmitri  Kharchenko  and 
General  Leonid  Shevstov,  briefed  the  JCG  delegates  in  Vienna  on 
precisely  which  TLE  the  Russian  army  intended  to  deploy  in  the 
Leningrad  and  North  Caucasus  Military  Districts  and  how  that 
equipment  would  be  used.  Then,  in  March  1994,  the  Russian  CFE 
Treaty  delegate  asked  the  JCG  to  consider  modifying  the  CFE 
Treaty  provisions  on  weapons  and  equipment  stored  in  the  two 
military  districts.  The  Russian  representative  argued  that  the  treaty 
restrictions  on  the  number  of  CFE  weapons  a  state  could  remove 
from  storage  were  out  of  date  and  militarily  cumbersome.  The 
JCG  took  no  action  on  these  Russian  requests.  Throughout  the 
remainder  of  1994,  Russia  continued  to  raise  these  flank  issues  in 
Vienna,  and  Ukraine  continued  its  support.  The  other  CFE  Treaty 
states,  however,  maintained  their  opposition  to  considering  any 
changes.  At  the  end  of  the  second  treaty  reduction  year,  the  CFE 
Treaty’s  flank  limit  problem  remained  unresolved.36 

On  December  10,  1994,  Russia  launched  a  military  assault 
on  rebel  forces  in  Chechnya,  in  the  Northern  Caucasus  region.  The 
Russian  military  sent  personnel,  tanks,  ACVs,  artillery,  and  other 
conventional  equipment  into  the  region  to  quell  the  rebellion. 
Within  a  month,  more  than  40,000  Russian  military  and  police 
troops  had  deployed  into  Chechnya.  Under  the  CFE  Treaty,  Russia 
was  limited  to  a  total  of  700  tanks,  580  ACVs,  and  1,200  artillery 
pieces  in  active  units  in  the  southern  flank  zone.  By  the  spring  of 
1995,  Russian  deployments  far  exceeded  these  limits.  If  Russia  did 
not  reduce  its  deployments  by  November  17,  1995,  the  end  of  the 
third  reduction  year,  it  faced  being  designated  as  out  of  compliance 
with  the  CFE  Treaty. 

Here  was  a  serious,  consequential  treaty  problem.  Quickly, 
the  issue  was  elevated  above  the  diplomatic  realm  into  interna¬ 
tional  politics.  In  May  1995,  President  Clinton  discussed  the 
flanks  issue  with  President  Yeltsin  at  the  Moscow  Summit.  In  late 
May,  Turkey  threatened  to  send  its  military  to  its  northeastern 
border  if  Russia  continued  to  station  excess  forces  in  the  southern

flank  zone.  Then,  on  June  1,  the  Russian  High  Command  an¬ 
nounced  that  the  58th  Army  would  be  organized  and  stationed  in 
the  Northern  Caucasus  Military  District.  During  the  summer 
months  the  rebellion  abated  as  Chechen  and  Russian  leaders 
signed  a  series  of  declarations  that  established  cease-fire  dates  and 
set  timetables  for  limited  troop  withdrawals.  But  these  declara¬ 
tions  proved  short-lived,  as  one  side  or  the  other  resumed  fighting. 
In  the  fall  of  1995,  with  the  approach  of  the  date  for  ending  the 
treaty’s  reduction  period  (November  17),  there  was  a  flurry  of 
diplomatic  activity  on  the  flanks  issuer’7 


Ambassador  Thomas  Graham,  Jr. 


NATO  nations  presented  a  plan  in  mid-September  for  revis¬ 
ing  the  treaty’s  flank  zones.  They  proposed  reducing  the  areas 
designated  as  flanks  by  excluding  two  military  oblasts  (districts) 
from  Russia’s  southern  flank  and  three  from  its  northern  flank. 
These  exclusions  would  give  the  Russian  High  Command  greater 
flexibility  in  deploying  its  conventional  forces  and  equipment 
internally.  In  return  for  this  treaty  modification,  Russia  had  to 
agree  to  remain  in  the  treaty,  accept  a  few  additional  inspections, 
and  provide  some  additional  information,  especially  on  any  TLE 
deployed  in  areas  that  were  formerly  located  in  the  flank  zones. 
The  Russians  rejected  this  proposal  categorically.  In  fact,  they 
rejected  all  offers  of  compromise  in  the  fall  of  1995.  In  those 
months,  President  Clinton,  Secretary  of  Defense  Perry,  and  ACDA 
Director  John  Holum  discussed  various  plans  with  their  Russian 
counterparts.  No  common  ground  emerged.  In  Vienna,  JGC  repre¬ 
sentatives  tried  to  work  out  an  acceptable  compromise  that  all 
nations  could  agree  to.  None  worked.  Consequently,  when  the 
November  17,  1995,  deadline  arrived,  the  30  CFE  states  issued  a 
joint  statement  identifying  the  states  that  had  not  met  their  treaty 
obligations.  Russia,  because  of  the  excess  TLE  stationed  in  the 
southern  flank  zone  and  its  failure  to  resolve  the  Black  Sea  Fleet 
issue,  was  not  in  compliance.38 

The  next  demarcation  point  for  possible  resolution  was  May 
1996.  The  CFE  Treaty  contained  a  provision  for  a  mandatory  all¬ 
signatory  states  conference  to  be  held  46  months  after  entry  into 
force.  The  CFE  First  Review  Conference  was  held  in  Vienna  May 
15-31,  1996.  The  flanks  issue  dominated  the  conference.  The 
Russian  representative,  Ambassador  Kulebyakin,  stated  and  re¬ 
stated  Russia’s  rationale  for  seeking  relief  from  Article  V  and  the 
flank  limits.  The  U.S.  delegation,  led  by  Thomas  Graham,  Jr., 
Special  Representative  of  the  President  for  Arms  Control,  Nonpro¬ 
liferation,  and  Disarmament,  and  Gregory  G.  Govan,  U.S.  Chief 
Delegate  to  the  JCG,  tried  repeatedly  to  shape  a  compromise  re¬ 
definition  of  the  flanks  that  was  acceptable  to  all  30  nations. 
Netherlands  Ambassador  Frank  Majoor  chaired  the  conference 
and  intervened  at  key  times  to  facilitate  a  solution.  Negotiations 
on  the  flanks  issue  were  very,  very  difficult,  but  in  the  final  hours 
Russian  Deputy  Foreign  Minister  Georgi  Mamedov  signaled

Moscow’s  acceptance  of  conference  language  and  the  agreement 
went  forward.  Russia  and  the  other  signatory  states  agreed  in  the 
Final  Document  that  (1)  Russia’s  flank  zone  areas  would  be  re¬ 
drawn,  excluding  certain  military  oblasts;  (2)  the  total  number  of 
CFE  equipment  allowed  in  the  Russian  military  districts — battle 
tanks,  ACVs,  and  artillery — would  be  revised  upward;  (3)  Russia 
would  provide  the  other  treaty  states  with  force  data  more  often; 
and  (4)  Russia  would  be  liable  for  up  to  10  additional  declared  site 
inspections  annually  in  the  flank  zones.39 

During  the  difficult  negotiations,  four  nations — Ukraine, 
Moldova,  Georgia,  and  Azerbaijan — expressed  major  concerns 
about  Russia’s  future  security  intentions.  In  one  way  these  nations 
were  articulating  new  regional  concerns;  in  another  way  they  were 
expressing  their  fears  about  the  possibility  of  large  states’  influenc¬ 
ing  small  states  and  the  significance  of  international  law.  In  the 
conference’s  Final  Document,  each  of  these  four  nations  submitted 
a  separate  annex  statement  explaining  its  concerns  (see  Appendix 
D).  During  the  conference,  some  of  the  NATO  nations,  particu¬ 
larly  France  and  Great  Britain,  supported  these  nations.  France 
took  the  position  that  every  state  had  to  respect  the  national  sover¬ 
eignty  of  every  other  state,  especially  states  that  were  parties  to  the 
CFE  Treaty,  the  most  important,  modern,  all-European  multina¬ 
tional  arms  control  treaty.  With  the  positions  of  these  four  nations 
incorporated  into  the  final  statement,  the  delegates  moved  forward 
with  language  redefining  the  treaty’s  flank  limits.  Not  all  the  de¬ 
tails  were  ironed  out.  Subsequent  diplomatic  negotiations  on  the 
exact  territorial  demarcations  and  specific  timetables  for  move¬ 
ment  of  the  forces  remained  to  be  worked  out  in  the  Joint  Consul¬ 
tative  Group.

of  cooperation  with  the  treaty  verification  agencies  of  the  Eastern 
European  nations — Russia,  Ukraine,  Belarus,  and  the  other  succes¬ 
sor  states.  These  pressures  had  originated  as  a  political  and  diplo¬ 
matic  consequence  of  the  fall  of  the  Berlin  Wall;  the  revolutions  in 
Poland,  Hungary,  Czechoslovakia,  and  Bulgaria;  the  unification  of 
Germany;  and,  of  course,  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the 
creation  of  the  new  republics.  These  continental  upheavals  influ¬ 
enced  how  the  NATO  nations  approached  implementation  of  the 
CFE  Treaty.  Within  NATO,  Belgium,  Netherlands,  Great  Britain, 
and  Germany  were  the  strongest  advocates  of  establishing  joint 
inspector  training,  authorizing  joint  inspection  teams,  and  sharing 
treaty  data  among  all  signatory  nations. 

In  January  1993,  seven  months  into  the  CFE  Treaty’s  imple¬ 
mentation,  NATO’s  Verification  Coordinating  Committee  invited 
the  directors  of  the  national  verification  agencies,  east  and  west,  to 
attend  an  important  meeting  at  NATO  Headquarters.  At  this 
meeting,  the  16  NATO  nations,  acting  through  the  VCC,  formally 
invited  the  14  Eastern  CFE  Treaty  nations  to  have  their  inspectors 
participate  on  NATO  nations’  joint  multinational  inspection 
teams.  They  would  be  identified  as  NATO  nation  teams,  but  indi¬ 
vidual  inspectors  from  one,  two,  or  more  of  the  Eastern  bloc  na¬ 
tions,  as  well  as  from  the  other  NATO  nations,  could  participate. 
The  NATO  nation  conducting  the  inspection  would  lead  the  team.

The  CFE  Treaty:  A  Durable  Structure  for  Post-Cold  War  Europe 


After  hearing  the  concept,  the  directors  of  the 
Eastern  states’  verification  agencies  accepted  the 
invitation.  Within  a  matter  of  months,  it  became 
routine  for  inspectors  from  “cooperating  part¬ 
ner”  nations  to  serve  on  NATO-led  multinational 
CFE  inspection  teams  conducting  reduction 
inspections  in  Eastern  Europe.40  Brigadier  Gen¬ 
eral  Heinz  Loquai,  Director  of  the  German  Fed¬ 
eral  Armed  Forces  Verification  Center,  observed, 

“At  first  it  was  not  so  easy  for  the  inspected 
countries,  especially  the  former  Warsaw  Pact 
countries,  to  understand  why  guest  inspectors 
were  coming  along  with  the  [NATO  nation] 
inspection  teams.  But,  in  my  opinion,  the  partici¬ 
pation  of  the  guest  inspectors  is  a  good  develop¬ 
ment.  Germany  has  opened  more  than  50  percent 
of  all  its  inspections  for  the  guest  inspectors.”41 

In  1993  and  up  to  June  1994,  83  NATO-led  multinational 
inspection  teams  conducted  CFE  Treaty  inspections  in  Eastern 
Europe.  According  to  Necil  Nedimoglu,  Director  of  NATO’s  Veri¬ 
fication  and  Implementation  Coordination  Section  (VICS),  the 
cooperative  program  for  guest  inspectors  worked  so  well  that  it 
stimulated  other  cooperative  initiatives.  Late  in  1993,  a  few  East¬ 
ern  European  treaty  nations  invited  the  NATO  nations  to  send 
guest  inspectors  to  serve  on  their  inspection  teams.  After  consider¬ 
able  discussion  within  the  alliance,  in  June  1994  the  VCC  issued  a 
statement  to  NATO  state  verification  agencies  and  staffs.  It  stated 
that  Western  inspectors  could  join  Eastern-led  CFE  inspection 
teams  that  were  conducting  East-on-East  inspections.  During  1994 
and  1995,  the  United  States,  France,  Holland,  and  Belgium  partici¬ 
pated  in  many  of  these  joint  inspections.42 

Along  with  these  changes,  the  VCC  also  invited  the  Eastern 
nation  treaty  agencies  to  send  individual  inspectors  to  participate 
in  NATO-conducted  CFE  Treaty  courses.  They  accepted;  and  in 
1993  and  1994,  80  inspectors  from  Eastern  nations’  verification 
agencies  attended  courses  for  CFE  Treaty  inspectors  and  escorts  at 
the  NATO  school  at  Oberammergau,  Germany.  Other  Eastern 
bloc  inspectors  participated  in  a  NATO  course  on  monitoring  CFE 
reductions  held  at  the  Belgian  Military  Camp  at  Leopoldville.  The 
guest  inspectors  at  this  Belgian  reduction  course  even  taught  a 
portion  of  the  course.  They  discussed  the  reduction  methods  being 
used  in  their  nations,  and,  in  turn,  the  NATO  national  inspectors 
explained  how  they  would  monitor  those  reductions.  The  VCC 
also  sponsored  seminars  for  all  verification  agency  directors  at 
NATO  Headquarters  in  Brussels.  These  two-day  seminars  focused 
on  treaty  implementation  issues  and  on  strengthening  director-to- 
director  communications,  but  they  should  not  be  construed  as  a 
substitute  for  the  CFE  Treaty’s  Joint  Consultative  Group  meeting

in  Vienna.  The  JCG  was  the  official  forum  for  resolving  treaty 
issues  and  for  authorizing  any  modifications  to  the  treaty. 

Other  cooperative  initiatives  demonstrated  the  new  era  of 
West-East  European  relations  associated  with  implementing  the 
CFE  Treaty.  In  November  1993  the  NATO  nations  offered  all 
Eastern  nations  access  to  the  alliance’s  computerized  CFE  Treaty 
database,  VERITY.  The  database  contained  the  NATO  nations’ 
annual  military  force  data,  information  from  their  treaty  inspec¬ 
tion  reports,  and  data  extracted  from  the  inspections  that  moni¬ 
tored  TLE  reductions.  VERITY  had  an  electronic  mail  feature  and 
was  on-line  24  hours  a  day,  every  day  at  NATO  Headquarters. 
While  VERITY  had  no  legal  status,  most  of  the  NATO  nation 
verification  agencies  found  the  system  useful  in  preparing  for 
inspection  missions  and  monitoring  overall  reductions.  Of  the  14 
Eastern  verification  agencies,  all  except  Armenia  and  Azerbaijan 
accepted  the  November  13  invitation  to  participate  in  the  comput¬ 
erized  data  system.  After  a  few  months  to  schedule  and  conduct 
training  courses  at  NATO  Headquarters  for  the  verification  agen¬ 
cies’  automated  data  managers,  the  expanded  VERITY  system 
went  into  effect  in  March  1994.  Among  the  participating  nations 
(28  of  30),  the  system  helped  verification  agency  staffs  track  the 
annual  data  exchange  of  national  military  force  holdings;  notifica¬ 
tions  of  reduction  events;  results  of  reductions;  and  inspection 
information  regarding  the  time,  place,  and  type  of  inspection.  By 
mid-1994,  the  VERITY  database  included  inspection  reports  from 
all  NATO  nations,  the  Eastern  European  nations,  and  all  but  two 
of  the  new  republics.43 


Evaluating  the  CFE  Treaty:  The  First 
Review  Conference 


Modernizing  by  lifting  the 
group  of  states  concept . 


Incorporated  into  the  treaty  was  a  provision  for  a  review 
conference  of  all  the  signatory  states  to  be  held  46  months  after 
entry  into  force.  Since  the  CFE  Treaty  entered  into  force  in  mid- 
July  1992,  the  treaty’s  First  Review  Conference  was  held  in  mid- 
May  1996.  Representatives  from  all  states  parties  met  in  Vienna 
from  May  15-31.  In  46  months,  much  had  changed.  The  Warsaw 
Treaty  Organization  had  collapsed,  prompting  some  states,  princi¬ 
pally  Russia,  to  advocate  “modernizing”  the  treaty  by  removing 
the  group  of  states  concept  from  the  treaty’s  text.  This  recommen¬ 
dation  was  opposed  by  other  states,  principally  the  United  States, 
citing  the  conference’s  short  duration  and  the  opportunity  to  re¬ 
solve  more  pressing  treaty  implementation  issues.  Specifically, 
those  issues  were  Russia’s  commitment  to  reducing  its  TLE  east  of 
the  Urals,  the  demands  of  Russia  and  Ukraine  for  adjusting  the 
flank  zone  limits,  the  problem  of  accounting  for  the  TLE  transfers 
among  the  treaty  states  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  and  the  issue 
of  authorizing  a  review  and  update  of  the  treaty’s  Protocol  on 


255 


The  CFE  Treaty:  A  Durable  Structure  for  Post-Cold  War  Europe 


Existing  Types  of  Conventional  Armaments  and  Equipment 
(POET).  The  two  major  recommendations  for  the  conference 
agenda — treaty  modernization  and  treaty  compliance/implementa¬ 
tion  issues — were  not  incompatible.  Both  were  part  of  the 
conference’s  final  statement;  however,  implementation  issues  domi¬ 
nated  the  conference  agenda.44 

Because  of  the  meeting’s  short  two-week  duration,  the  confer¬ 
ence  delegates  formed  working  groups  to  develop  recommenda¬ 
tions  and  textual  language  for  debate  and  decision.  Negotiations 
were  conducted  by  representatives  of  individual  states  (or  at  times 
by  groups  of  states),  while  decisions  were  made  by  consensus  of 
all  30  state  parties.  The  U.S.  delegation  was  led  by  Ambassador 
Thomas  Graham,  Jr.  The  U.S.  representative  to  the  Joint  Consulta¬ 
tive  Group,  Gregory  G.  Govan,  formerly  a  Director  of  OSIA, 
worked  closely  with  the  large  U.S.  delegation.  Russia’s  representa¬ 
tive  to  the  JCG,  Vyacheslav  Kulebyakin,  worked  with  Russia’s 
Deputy  Foreign  Minister  Georgi  Mamedov.  Germany  was  repre¬ 
sented  by  Ambassador  Rudiger  Hartmann;  France  by  Ambassador 
Bernard  Miget,  and  Ukraine  by  Deputy  Foreign  Minister 
Konstyantyn  Gryshchenko.  Ambassador  Frank  Majoor  of  the 
Netherlands  chaired  the  conference.  All  discussions  and  negotia¬ 
tions  were  conducted  in  confidence.

When  the  conference  concluded  on  May  31,  the  30  states 
issued  a  Final  Document  (see  Appendix  D).  The  states  resolved  the 
thorny  issue  of  redefining  the  treaty’s  flank  zones.  Russia  made  a 
specific  commitment  to  reduce  its  TLE  holdings  east  of  the  Urals. 
All  the  treaty  states  agreed  that  the  JCG  should  update  the  POET 
each  year.  The  conference  representatives  also  addressed  the  future 
of  the  treaty.  In  the  Final  Document,  the  30  state  parties  instructed 
the  delegates  to  the  Joint  Consultative  Group  to  “expand  upon 
their  work”  in  accordance  with  the  treaty’s  Article  XVI.  Since  this 
article  had  established  and  empowered  the  JCG,  the  Review  Con¬ 
ference  representatives  were  essentially  increasing  and  redirecting 
the  JCG’s  responsibilities.  They  charged  the  Vienna  treaty  group 
with  creating  a  process  to  modernize  the  treaty  and  to  improve  its 
operations.  On  the  subject  of  treaty  modernization,  the  state  repre¬ 
sentatives  agreed  on  12  topics  for  the  JCG’s  consideration  (see 
Appendix  D,  Annex  D).  These  topics  included  such  fundamental 
treaty  terms  as  “groups  of  states  parties,”  “area  of  application,” 
and  “designated  permanent  storage  site.”  For  improving  treaty 
operations,  the  conference  representatives  developed  15  specific 
recommendations  for  “further  consideration  and  resolution”  by 
the  JCG  (see  Appendix  D,  Annex  E).  Finally,  the  states  instructed 
the  JCG  to  develop  a  progress  report  and  present  it  at  the  meeting 
of  the  Organization  for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  in 
Lisbon,  Portugal,  in  December  1996. 

One  of  the  most  interesting  aspect  of  the  First  Review 
Conference’s  Final  Document  was  the  section  reviewing  the  CFE 
Treaty’s  operations.  In  the  46  months  that  had  elapsed  since  entry 
into  force,  much  had  changed  in  Europe,  and  much  had  been 
accomplished  under  the  provisions  of  the  treaty.  The  document 
summarized  some  of  these  accomplishments45: 

The  states  parties  note  with  satisfaction  that  more  than 
58,000  pieces  of  conventional  armaments  and  equipment 
have  been  reduced,  and  that  the  overall  holdings  of  conven¬ 
tional  armaments  and  equipment  within  the  area  of  applica¬ 
tion  are  substantially  lower  than  the  limits  set  in  the  treaty. 

More  than  2,500  inspections  have  taken  place.  A  permanent 
system  for  regular  and  routine  exchange  of  treaty  notifica¬ 
tions  and  other  information  has  been  developed.  The  Joint 
Consultative  Group  has  been  firmly  established  and  has 
demonstrated  its  utility  and  importance  as  the  ongoing  treaty 
forum. 

With  regard  to  the  concluding  act,  the  states  parties  note  with 
satisfaction  that  the  personnel  strength  of  conventional  armed 
forces  in  the  area  of  application  was  reduced  by  1.2  million 
persons. 

The  states  parties  note  that  the  treaty  established  a  high  de¬ 
gree  of  transparency  in  military  relations  through  its  compre- 


257 


The  CFE  Treaty:  A  Durable  Structure  for  Post-Cold  War  Europe 


hensive  system  for  exchange  of  information  and  for  verifica¬ 
tion.  Together  with  the  extensive  reductions  of  conventional 
armaments  and  equipment,  this  has  led  to  greater  predictabil¬ 
ity  and  confidence  in  security  relations.  The  treaty  has  also 
nurtured  the  development  of  new  patterns  of  cooperation  in 
Europe  and  provides  a  basis  for  stability  and  enhanced  secu¬ 
rity  in  Europe  at  substantially  lower  levels  of  conventional 
armaments  and  equipment  than  heretofore.  Although  risks 
and  challenges  still  exist  in  some  parts  of  Europe,  the  capabil¬ 
ity  for  launching  surprise  attack  and  the  danger  of  large-scale 
offensive  action  in  Europe  as  a  whole  have  been  diminished 
substantially.  Nevertheless,  the  achievement  of  the  goals  of 
the  treaty  in  the  whole  area  of  its  application  requires  con¬ 
tinuous  efforts  by  the  states  parties. 


Evaluating  the  Treaty:  Comparing  the 
Numbers 

Following  the  end  of  the  CFE  Treaty’s  40-month  reduction 
period,  all  treaty  states  declared  their  force  levels  in  the  five  cat¬ 
egories  of  offensive  weapons.  This  declaration  allowed  nations  to 
compare  the  “anticipated”  number  of  tanks,  artillery,  armored 
combat  vehicles  (ACVs),  combat  aircraft,  and  attack  helicopters 
with  the  “actual”  figure  at  the  end  of  the  reduction  phase.  The 
data  were  declared  by  each  nation;  when  aggregated  for  the  group 
of  state  parties  (Western  Group  and  Eastern  Group),  the  figures 
indicated  that  the  actual  reductions  were  well  below  the  CFE 
Treaty’s  anticipated  ceilings  (table  8-2).

Marry  U.S.  tanks  deployed  from  U.S.  Army  units  in  Western  Europe  to  the  Gulf  War. 

For  a  variety  of  reasons,  national  reductions  of  these  weapons 
continued  after  the  mid-November  1995  treaty  deadline.  A  few 
nations — such  as  Belarus,  Ukraine,  and  Russia — had  not  reduced 
all  their  TLE  as  required  under  the  treaty.  Other  nations — Poland, 
Romania,  and  others — continued  to  reduce  CFE  weapons  because 
they  were  excess  to  their  national  force  structure.  By  the  time  of 
the  CFE  Treaty’s  First  Review  Conference  in  May  1996,  the  state 
parties  announced  that  the  total  number  of  reductions  had  ex¬ 
ceeded  58,000  items.  At  that  conference,  Russia  pledged  to  destroy 
by  the  year  2000  the  weapons  and  equipment  located  beyond  the 
Ural  Mountains  and  in  certain  naval  units. 

A  comparison  of  selected  states’  CFE  holdings  at  the  begin¬ 
ning  of  the  baseline  period  (July  1992)  and  at  the  end  of  the  reduc¬ 
tion  period  (November  1995)  indicates  that  the  larger  nations  had 
significantly  reduced  their  conventional  weapons  in  the  treaty’s 
territorial  zones  (table  8-3). 

Not  all  of  these  reductions  were  driven  by  the  CFE  Treaty. 

The  massive  withdrawals  of  U.S.  military  forces  from  Western 
Europe,  for  example,  were  caused  by  the  need  to  deploy  combat 
troops  to  the  Middle  East  for  the  Gulf  War  and  by  reductions  in 
the  American  military  services  following  the  Cold  War.  Russia’s 
large-scale  reductions  were  also  caused  by  historic  forces,  largely 
economic  and  political,  that  were  external  to  the  requirements  of 
the  CFE  Treaty.  Consequently,  one  must  be  cautious  in  drawing 
conclusions  from  these  numbers  alone.  Nations  did  not  make 
excess  reductions  in  their  military  forces  and  weapons  to  comply

with  the  treaty;  rather,  they  were  compelled  by  economic,  strate¬ 
gic,  and  military  reasons  to  reduce  their  military  forces. 

The  numbers,  however,  do  confirm  that  there  have  been 
major  reductions  in  national  military  forces  on  the  European 
continent.  The  United  States,  for  instance,  reduced  or  withdrew 
8,128  CFE  TLE  items  from  its  forces  stationed  in  Western  Europe. 
This  was  a  63  percent  reduction  in  its  offensive  forces  on  the  Euro¬ 
pean  continent.  Collectively,  the  states  of  the  former  Soviet  Union 
possessed  71,080  weapons  in  July  1992;  three  years  later  they  had 
reduced  these  weapons  to  39,581  or  55  percent.  For  Russia,  the 
largest  of  the  new  republics,  the  figures  indicate  that  its  November 
1995  holdings  of  tanks,  artillery,  ACVs,  combat  aircraft,  and 
helicopters  west  of  the  Ural  Mountains  was  25,261.  In  July  1992, 
Russia  had  declared  42,692  CFE  weapons;  three  years  later  it  had 
reduced  17,431  items  or  41  percent.  Germany  reduced  more  CFE 
weapons— 13,701— than  any  other  NATO  nation.  Certainly

German  unification  in  1990  had  skewed  these  figures,  with  the 
addition  of  the  former  German  Democratic  Republic’s  ground  and 
air  forces.  In  July  1992,  Germany  declared  22,300  CFE  items;  in 
November  1995,  it  stated  it  held  8,599  TLE,  a  reduction  of 
13,701  or  61  percent. 

Reductions  of  full-time  military  personnel  occurred  in  virtu¬ 
ally  every  CFE  Treaty  state.  The  CFE  1A  Agreement  dealt  with 
limits  on  full-time  military  personnel.  When  the  states  parties 
agreed  to  implement  the  treaty  provisionally  in  July  1992,  they 
declared  that  40  months  later  their  military  manpower  would  be 
at  or  below  a  specific  numerical  ceiling.  The  states,  themselves,  set 
the  ceilings;  consequently,  they  were  quite  high.  When  the  40- 
month  reduction  period  ended  in  November  1995,  all  nations 
reporting  military  personnel  force  data  were  in  compliance  with 
the  CFE  1A  Agreement.  Three  nations — Armenia,  Georgia,  and 
Belarus — reported  no  data.  Table  8-4  contains  military  manpower 
figures  for  selected  nations  at  the  starting  and  ending  periods,  July 
1992  and  November  1995. 

One  should  approach  these  figures  with  caution.  As  in  other 
comparisons  associated  with  the  CFE  Treaty,  larger  forces  must  be 
considered.  Most  of  the  reasons  for  these  manpower  reductions  lie 
outside  the  CFE  Treaty;  the  treaty  was  not  the  single  causal  factor 
that  forced  these  manpower  reductions. 

There  is  no  comprehensive  set  of  figures  listing  all  on-site 
inspections  conducted  by  every  nation  under  the  CFE  Treaty.  The 
NATO  nations  recorded  on  their  VERITY  database  system  only 
the  inspections  for  the  Group  of  Western  States.  Inspections  con¬ 
ducted  by  the  Eastern  nations,  especially  inspections  on  each  other, 


261 


The  CFE  Treaty:  A  Durable  Structure  for  Post-Cold  War  Europe 


were  not  systematically  recorded  in  any  central  database  or  reposi¬ 
tory.  It  was  not  until  June  1994  that  most  of  the  CFE  Treaty  states 
agreed  to  record  their  on-site  inspections  in  the  VERITY  system; 
thus,  no  comprehensive  list  exists  of  inspections  by  all  states  be¬ 
fore  June  1994.  The  United  States,  through  the  On-Site  Inspection 
Agency,  did  record  the  number  and  type  of  its  own  CFE  Treaty 
inspections.  Compiled  annually,  these  figures  indicated  an  intense 
involvement  by  the  United  States  in  monitoring  every  aspect  of  the 
CFE  Treaty  (table  8-5).

Evaluating  the  Treaty:  Final  Thoughts 

If  one  asked  in  May  1996  why  the  CFE  Treaty  had  succeeded 
as  a  continental  European  arms  control  treaty,  there  were  many 
answers.  On  the  geopolitical  level,  Europe  had  experienced  his¬ 
toric  changes  from  1989  through  1992  that  ended  the  Cold  War, 
unified  Germany,  dissolved  the  Soviet  Union,  and  created  new 
European  states.  On  the  military  level,  Europe  had  witnessed  in 
just  five  years  (1989-1994)  the  Soviet  Union’s  and  Russia’s  with¬ 
drawal  of  more  than  700,000  military  personnel  from  Germany, 
the  Czech  and  Slovak  Republics,  Hungary,  Poland,  Bulgaria,  Ro¬ 
mania,  and  the  Baltic  states.  The  United  States  had  withdrawn 
220,000  troops  from  Germany,  Italy,  Great  Britain,  Belgium, 
Holland,  and  other  Western  European  nations.  On  the  economic 
level,  Central  and  Eastern  European  nations  had  shifted  from 
socialist  economies  to  capitalist  market  economies,  creating  a 
broad  political  consensus  for  consumer  goods  over  military  equip¬ 
ment.  In  nation  after  nation,  this  economic  transition  proved 
extraordinarily  difficult,  creating  societies  racked  by  inflation  and 
unemployment.  Arms  reduction  treaties  held  a  strong  appeal  for 
the  citizens  of  most  European  nations,  east  and  west.

On  the  institutional  level,  some  Eastern  European  nations 
sought  entry  into  the  European  Union  and  the  established  NATO 
alliance.  Adherence  to  the  CFE  Treaty,  one  of  the  NATO  alliance’s 
fundamental  post-Cold  War  objectives,  furthered  the  foreign 
policy  objectives  of  these  nations.  Finally,  on  the  level  of  interna¬ 
tional  law,  the  30-nation  CFE  Treaty  represented  a  fundamental 
legal  commitment  to  a  single  continental  arms  control  treaty  per¬ 
manently  limiting  five  categories  of  conventional  military  offensive 
weapons.  The  treaty  contained  important  provisions  for  sharing 
force  data  and  for  verification  by  on-site  inspection,  thus  creating 
a  legal  basis  for  transparency  across  national  borders  on  a  heavily 
armed  continent.  All  things  considered,  national  compliance  with 
the  CFE  Treaty  was  the  result  of  a  broad  European  consensus 
constructed  on  significant  changes  in  geopolitics,  military  strategy, 
economics,  institutional  desires,  and  a  determination  to  establish 
international  law  across  the  vast  continent. 

These  factors  were  widely  known;  what  was  not  so  well 
known  were  the  contributions  of  the  30  nations’  verification  agen¬ 
cies,  the  on-site  inspectors  monitoring  the  treaty’s  provisions  and 
protocols,  the  military  forces  reducing  the  weapons,  and  the  Verifi¬ 
cation  Coordinating  Committee  and  the  Joint  Consultative  Group 
facilitating  implementation.  Collectively,  these  elements  had  imple¬ 
mented  the  complex,  continent-wide  treaty  day  by  day,  month  by 
month,  year  by  year. 

The  people  of  these  organizations  were  predominantly,  but 
not  exclusively,  military  officers  and  noncommissioned  officers. 
They  were  the  closest  to  treaty  operations;  they  knew  whether  the 
treaty  was  meeting  its  objectives  or  not.  Most  believed  that  the 
CFE  Treaty  had  achieved  its  objectives:  reducing  the  level  of  offen¬ 
sive  conventional  arms  on  the  continent,  marking  out  territorial 
zones  for  the  permanent  reduction  of  forces  and  weapons,  and 
establishing  a  rule  of  law  for  the  future  of  Europe,  west  and  east. 

These  achievements  were  important.  The  CFE  Treaty  states 
were  constructing  the  foundations  of  post-Cold  War  Europe. 

Trust  and  verify.

hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  States  Parties, 

Guided  by  the  Mandate  for  Negotiation  on  Conventional 
Armed  Forces  in  Europe  of  January  10,  1989,  and  having 
conducted  this  negotiation  in  Vienna  beginning  on  March  9, 
1989, 

Guided  by  the  objectives  and  the  purposes  of  the 
Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe,  within 
the  framework  of  which  the  negotiation  of  this  Treaty  was 
conducted, 

Recalling  their  obligation  to  refrain  in  their  mutual 
relations,  as  well  as  in  their  international  relations  in 
general,  from  the  threat  or  use  of  force  against  the  territorial 
integrity  or  political  independence  of  any  State,  or  in  any 
other  manner  inconsistent  with  the  purposes  and  principles 
of  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations, 

Conscious  of  the  need  to  prevent  any  military  conflict  in 
Europe, 

Conscious  of  the  common  responsibility  which  they  all 
have  for  seeking  to  achieve  greater  stability  and  security  in 
Europe, 

Striving  to  replace  military  confrontation  with  a  new 
pattern  of  security  relations  among  all  the  States  Parties 
based  on  peaceful  cooperation  and  thereby  to  contribute  to 
overcoming  the  division  of  Europe, 

Committed  to  the  objectives  of  establishing  a  secure  and 
stable  balance  of  conventional  armed  forces  in  Europe  at 
lower  levels  than  heretofore,  of  eliminating  disparities 
prejudicial  to  stability  and  security  and  of  eliminating,  as  a 
matter  of  high  priority,  the  capability  for  launching  surprise 
attack  and  for  initiating  large-scale  offensive  action  in 
Europe, 

Recalling  that  they  signed  or  acceded  to  the  Treaty  of 
Brussels  of  1948,  the  Treaty  of  Washington  of  1949  or  the 
Treaty  of  Warsaw  of  1955  and  that  they  have  the  right  to  be 
or  not  to  be  a  party  to  treaties  of  alliance, 


Committed  to  the  objective  of  ensuring  that  the  numbers 
of  conventional  armaments  and  equipment  limited  by  the 
Treaty  within  the  area  of  application  of  this  Treaty  do  not 
exceed  40,000  battle  tanks,  60,000  armoured  combat 
vehicles,  40,000  pieces  of  artillery,  13,600  combat  aircraft 
and  4,000  attack  helicopters, 

Affirming  that  this  Treaty  is  not  intended  to  affect 
adversely  the  security  interests  of  any  State, 

Affirming  their  commitment  to  continue  the  conventional 
arms  control  process  including  negotiations,  taking  into 
account  future  requirements  for  European  stability  and 
security  in  the  light  of  political  developments  in  Europe, 

Have  agreed  as  follows: 

Article  I 

1.  Each  State  Party  shall  carry  out  the  obligations  set 
forth  in  this  Treaty  in  accordance  with  its  provisions, 
including  those  obligations  relating  to  the  following  five 
categories  of  conventional  armed  forces:  battle  tanks, 
armoured  combat  vehicles,  artillery,  combat  aircraft  and 
combat  helicopters. 

2.  Each  State  Party  also  shall  carry  out  the  other 
measures  set  forth  in  this  Treaty  designed  to  ensure  security 
and  stability  both  during  the  period  of  reduction  of 
conventional  armed  forces  and  after  the  completion  of 
reductions. 

3.  This  Treaty  incorporates  the  Protocol  on  Existing 
Types  of  Conventional  Armaments  and  Equipment, 
hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Protocol  on  Existing  Types, 
with  an  Annex  thereto;  the  Protocol  on  Procedures

Equipment  Limited  by  the  Treaty  on  Conventional  Armed 
Forces  in  Europe,  hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Protocol  on 
Reduction;  the  Protocol  on  Procedures  Governing  the

Article  VI 

With  the  objective  of  ensuring  that  no  single  State  Party 
possesses  more  than  approximately  one-third  of  the 
conventional  armaments  and  equipment  limited  by  the 
Treaty  within  the  area  of  application,  each  State  Party  shall 
limit  and,  as  necessary,  reduce  its  battle  tanks,  armoured 
combat  vehicles,  artillery,  combat  aircraft  and  attack 
helicopters  so  that,  40  months  after  entry  into  force  of  this 
Treaty  and  thereafter,  the  numbers  within  the  area  of 
application  for  that  State  Party  do  not  exceed: 

(A)  13,300  battle  tanks;

Article  VII 

1.  In  order  that  the  limitations  set  forth  in  Articles  IV, 

V  and  VI  are  not  exceeded,  no  State  Party  shall  exceed,  from 
40  months  after  entry  into  force  of  this  Treaty,  the  maximum 
levels  which  it  has  previously  agreed  upon  within  its  group 
of  States  Parties,  in  accordance  with  paragraph  7  of  this 
Article,  for  its  holdings  of  conventional  armaments  and 
equipment  limited  by  the  Treaty  and  of  which  it  has 
provided  notification  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this 
Article. 

2.  Each  State  Party  shall  provide  at  the  signature  of  this 
Treaty  notification  to  all  other  States  Parties  of  the 
maximum  levels  for  its  holdings  of  conventional  armaments 
and  equipment  limited  by  the  Treaty.  The  notification  of  the 
maximum  levels  for  holdings  of  conventional  armaments 
and  equipment  limited  by  the  Treaty  provided  by  each  State 
Party  at  the  signature  of  this  Treaty  shall  remain  valid  until 
the  date  specified  in  a  subsequent  notification  pursuant  to 
paragraph  3  of  this  Article. 

3.  In  accordance  with  the  limitations  set  forth  in 
Articles  IV,  V  and  VI,  each  State  Party  shall  have  the  right  to 
change  the  maximum  levels  for  its  holdings  of  conventional 
armaments  and  equipment  limited  by  the  Treaty.  Any  change 
in  the  maximum  levels  for  holdings  of  a  State  Party  shall  be 
notified  by  that  State  Party  to  all  other  States  Parties  at  least 
90  days  in  advance  of  the  date,  specified  in  the  notification, 


on  which  such  a  change  takes  effect.  In  order  not  to  exceed 
any  of  the  limitations  set  forth  in  Articles  IV  and  V,  any 
increase  in  the  maximum  levels  for  holdings  of  a  State  Party 
that  would  otherwise  cause  those  limitations  to  be  exceeded 
shall  be  preceded  or  accompanied  by  a  corresponding 
reduction  in  the  previously  notified  maximum  levels  for 
holdings  of  conventional  armaments  and  equipment  limited 
by  the  Treaty  of  one  or  more  States  Parties  belonging  to  the 
same  group  of  States  Parties.  The  notification  of  a  change  in 
the  maximum  levels  for  holdings  shall  remain  valid  from  the 
date  specified  in  the  notification  until  the  date  specified  in  a 
subsequent  notification  of  change  pursuant  to  this 
paragraph. 

4.  Each  notification  required  pursuant  to  paragraph  2 
or  3  of  this  Article  for  armoured  combat  vehicles  shall  also 
include  maximum  levels  for  the  holdings  of  armoured 
infantry  fighting  vehicles  and  heavy  armament  combat 
vehicles  of  the  State  Party  providing  the  notification. 

5.  Ninety  days  before  expiration  of  the  40-month 
period  of  reductions  set  forth  in  Article  VIII  and 
subsequently  at  the  time  of  any  notification  of  a  change 
pursuant  to  paragraph  3  of  this  Article,  each  State  Party 
shall  provide  notification  of  the  maximum  levels  for  its 
holdings  of  battle  tanks,  armoured  combat  vehicles  and 
artillery  with  respect  to  each  of  the  areas  described  in  Article 
IV,  paragraphs  2  to  4  and  Article  V,  paragraph  1, 
subparagraph  (A). 

6.  A  decrease  in  the  numbers  of  conventional 
armaments  and  equipment  limited  by  the  Treaty  held  by  a 
State  Party  and  subject  to  notification  pursuant  to  the 
Protocol  on  Information  Exchange  shall  by  itself  confer  no 
right  on  any  other  State  Party  to  increase  the  maximum 
levels  for  its  holdings  subject  to  notification  pursuant  to  this 
Article. 

7.  It  shall  be  the  responsibility  solely  of  each  individual 
State  Party  to  ensure  that  the  maximum  levels  for  its 
holdings  notified  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this  Article 
are  not  exceeded.  States  Parties  belonging  to  the  same  group 
of  States  Parties  shall  consult  in  order  to  ensure  that  the 
maximum  levels  for  holdings  notified  pursuant  to  the 
provisions  of  this  Article,  taken  together  as  appropriate,  do 
not  exceed  the  limitations  set  forth  in  Articles  IV,  V  and  VI. 

Article  VIII 

1.  The  numerical  limitations  set  forth  in  Articles  IV,  V 
and  VI  shall  be  achieved  only  by  means  of  reduction  in 
accordance  with  the  Protocol  on  Reduction,  the  Protocol  on 
Helicopter  Recategorisation,  the  Protocol  on  Aircraft 
Reclassification,  the  Footnote  to  Section  I,  paragraph  2, 
subparagraph  (A)  of  the  Protocol  on  Existing  Types  and  the

2.  The  categories  of  conventional  armaments  and 
equipment  subject  to  reductions  are  battle  tanks,  armoured 
combat  vehicles,  artillery,  combat  aircraft  and  attack 
helicopters.  The  specific  types  are  listed  in  the  Protocol  on 
Existing  Types. 

(A)  Battle  tanks  and  armoured  combat  vehicles  shall  be 
reduced  by  destruction,  conversion  for  non-military 
purposes,  placement  on  static  display,  use  as  ground 
targets,  or,  in  the  case  of  armoured  personnel 


Appendix  A:  Treaty  on  Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe  271 


carriers,  modification  in  accordance  with  the 
Footnote  to  Section  I,  paragraph  2,  subparagraph 

(A)  of  the  Protocol  on  Existing  Types. 

(B)  Artillery  shall  be  reduced  by  destruction  or 
placement  on  static  display,  or,  in  the  case  of  self- 
propelled  artillery,  by  use  as  ground  targets. 

(C)  Combat  aircraft  shall  be  reduced  by  destruction, 
placement  on  static  display,  use  for  ground 
instructional  purposes,  or,  in  the  case  of  specific 
models  or  versions  of  combat-capable  trainer 
aircraft,  reclassification  into  unarmed  trainer 
aircraft. 

(D)  Specialised  attack  helicopters  shall  be  reduced  by 
destruction,  placement  on  static  display,  or  use  for 
ground  instructional  purposes. 

(E)  Multi-purpose  attack  helicopters  shall  be  reduced  by 
destruction,  placement  on  static  display,  use  for 
ground  instructional  purposes,  or  recategorisation. 

3.  Conventional  armaments  and  equipment  limited  by 
the  Treaty  shall  be  deemed  to  be  reduced  upon  execution  of 
the  procedures  set  forth  in  the  Protocols  listed  in  paragraph 
1  of  this  Article  and  upon  notification  as  required  by  these 
Protocols.  Armaments  and  equipment  so  reduced  shall  no 
longer  be  counted  against  the  numerical  limitations  set  forth 
in  Articles  IV,  V  and  VI. 

4.  Reductions  shall  be  effected  in  three  phases  and 
completed  no  later  than  40  months  after  entry  into  force  of 
this  Treaty,  so  that: 

(A)  by  the  end  of  the  first  reduction  phase,  that  is,  no 
later  than  16  months  after  entry  into  force  of  this 
Treaty,  each  State  Party  shall  have  ensured  that  at 
least  25  percent  of  its  total  reduction  liability  in  each 
of  the  categories  of  conventional  armaments  and 
equipment  limited  by  the  Treaty  has  been  reduced; 

(B)  by  the  end  of  the  second  reduction  phase,  that  is,  no 
later  than  28  months  after  entry  into  force  of  this 
Treaty,  each  State  Party  shall  have  ensured  that  at 
least  60  percent  of  its  total  reduction  liability  in  each 
of  the  categories  of  conventional  armaments  and 
equipment  limited  by  the  Treaty  has  been  reduced; 

(C)  by  the  end  of  the  third  reduction  phase,  that  is,  no 
later  than  40  months  after  entry  into  force  of  this 
Treaty,  each  State  Party  shall  have  reduced  its  total 
reduction  liability  in  each  of  the  categories  of 
conventional  armaments  and  equipment  limited  by 
the  Treaty.  States  Parties  carrying  out  conversion  for 
non-military  purposes  shall  have  ensured  that  the 
conversion  of  all  battle  tanks  in  accordance  with 
Section  VIII  of  the  Protocol  on  Reduction  shall  have 
been  completed  by  the  end  of  the  third  reduction 
phase;  and 

(D)  armoured  combat  vehicles  deemed  reduced  by  reason 
of  having  been  partially  destroyed  in  accordance 
with  Section  VIII,  paragraph  6  of  the  Protocol  on 
Reduction  shall  have  been  fully  converted  for  non¬ 
military  purposes,  or  destroyed  in  accordance  with 
Section  IV  of  the  Protocol  on  Reduction,  no  later 
than  64  months  after  entry  into  force  of  this  Treaty. 


5.  Conventional  armaments  and  equipment  limited  by 
the  Treaty  to  be  reduced  shall  have  been  declared  present 
within  the  area  of  application  in  the  exchange  of 
information  at  signature  of  this  Treaty. 

6.  No  later  than  30  days  after  entry  into  force  of  this 
Treaty,  each  State  Party  shall  provide  notification  to  all 
other  States  Parties  of  its  reduction  liability. 

7.  Except  as  provided  for  in  paragraph  8  of  this 
Article,  a  State  Party’s  reduction  liability  in  each  category 
shall  be  no  less  than  the  difference  between  its  holdings 
notified,  in  accordance  with  the  Protocol  on  Information 
Exchange,  at  signature  or  effective  upon  entry  into  force  of 
this  Treaty,  whichever  is  the  greater,  and  the  maximum 
levels  for  holdings  it  notified  pursuant  to  Article  VII. 

8.  Any  subsequent  revision  of  a  State  Party’s  holdings 
notified  pursuant  to  the  Protocol  on  Information  Exchange 
or  of  its  maximum  levels  for  holdings  notified  pursuant  to 
Article  VII  shall  be  reflected  by  a  notified  adjustment  to  its 
reduction  liability.  Any  notification  of  a  decrease  in  a  State 
Party’s  reduction  liability  shall  be  preceded  or  accompanied 
by  either  a  notification  of  a  corresponding  increase  in 
holdings  not  exceeding  the  maximum  levels  for  holdings 
notified  pursuant  to  Article  VII  by  one  or  more  States 
Parties  belonging  to  the  same  group  of  States  Parties,  or  a 
notification  of  a  corresponding  increase  in  the  reduction 
liability  of  one  or  more  such  States  Parties. 

9.  Upon  entry  into  force  of  this  Treaty,  each  State 
Party  shall  notify  all  other  States  Parties,  in  accordance 
with  the  Protocol  on  Information  Exchange,  of  the 
locations  of  its  reduction  sites,  including  those  where  the 
final  conversion  of  battle  tanks  and  armoured  combat 
vehicles  for  non-military  purposes  will  be  carried  out. 

10.  Each  State  Party  shall  have  the  right  to  designate  as 
many  reduction  sites  as  it  wishes,  to  revise  without 
restriction  its  designation  of  such  sites  and  to  carry  out 
reduction  and  final  conversion  simultaneously  at  a 
maximum  of  20  sites.  States  Parties  shall  have  the  right  to 
share  or  co-locate  reduction  sites  by  mutual  agreement. 

11.  Notwithstanding  paragraph  10  of  this  Article, 
during  the  baseline  validation  period,  that  is,  the  interval 
between  entry  into  force  of  this  Treaty  and  120  days  after 
entry  into  force  of  this  Treaty,  reduction  shall  be  carried 
out  simultaneously  at  no  more  than  two  reduction  sites  for 
each  State  Party. 

12.  Reduction  of  conventional  armaments  and 
equipment  limited  by  the  Treaty  shall  be  carried  out  at 
reduction  sites,  unless  otherwise  specified  in  the  Protocols 
listed  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Article,  within  the  area  of 
application. 

13.  The  reduction  process,  including  the  results  of  the 
conversion  of  conventional  armaments  and  equipment 
limited  by  the  Treaty  for  non-military  purposes  both  during 
the  reduction  period  and  in  the  24  months  following  the 
reduction  period,  shall  be  subject  to  inspection,  without 
right  of  refusal,  in  accordance  with  the  Protocol  on 
Inspection.

the  provisions  of  Article  VIII,  battle  tanks,  armoured  combat 
vehicles,  artillery,  combat  aircraft  and  attack  helicopters 
within  the  area  of  application  shall  be  removed  from  service 
only  by  decommissioning,  provided  that: 

(A)  such  conventional  armaments  and  equipment  limited 
by  the  Treaty  are  decommissioned  and  awaiting 
disposal  at  no  more  than  eight  sites  which  shall  be

Protocol  on  Information  Exchange  and  shall  be 
identified  in  such  notifications  as  holding  areas  for 
decommissioned  conventional  armaments  and 
equipment  limited  by  the  Treaty.  If  sites  containing 
conventional  armaments  and  equipment  limited  by 
the  Treaty  decommissioned  from  service  also  contain 
any  other  conventional  armaments  and  equipment 
subject  to  the  Treaty,  the  decommissioned

Treaty  contained  at  designated  permanent  storage  sites 
belong.  The  notification  shall  include  the  designation  and 
location,  including  geographic  coordinates,  of  designated 
permanent  storage  sites  and  the  numbers  by  type  of  each

accommodation).  Designated  permanent  storage  sites  shall 
not  contain  firing  ranges  or  training  areas  associated  with 
conventional  armaments  and  equipment  limited  by  the 
Treaty.  Designated  permanent  storage  sites  shall  contain  only 
armaments  and  equipment  belonging  to  the  conventional 
armed  forces  of  a  State  Party.

storage  sites  unless  notification  has  been  provided  to  all 
other  States  Parties  at  least  42  days  in  advance  of  such 
removal.  Notification  shall  be  given  by  the  State  Party  to 
which  the  conventional  armaments  and  equipment  limited 
by  the  Treaty  belong.  Such  notification  shall  specify:

Article  XI 

1.  Each  State  Party  shall  limit  its  armoured  vehicle 
launched  bridges  so  that,  40  months  after  entry  into  force  of 
this  Treaty  and  thereafter,  for  the  group  of  States  Parties  to 
which  it  belongs  the  aggregate  number  of  armoured  vehicle 
launched  bridges  in  active  units  within  the  area  of 
application  does  not  exceed  740. 

2.  All  armoured  vehicle  launched  bridges  within  the 
area  of  application  in  excess  of  the  aggregate  number 
specified  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Article  for  each  group  of 
States  Parties  shall  be  placed  in  designated  permanent

launched  bridges  are  placed  in  a  designated  permanent 
storage  site,  either  on  their  own  or  together  with 
conventional  armaments  and  equipment  limited  by  the 
Treaty,  Article  X,  paragraphs  1  to  6  shall  apply  to  armoured 
vehicle  launched  bridges  as  well  as  to  conventional 
armaments  and  equipment  limited  by  the  Treaty.  Armoured 
vehicle  launched  bridges  placed  in  designated  permanent 
storage  sites  shall  not  be  considered  as  being  in  active  units. 

3.  Except  as  provided  for  in  paragraph  6  of  this  Article, 
armoured  vehicle  launched  bridges  may  be  removed,  subject 
to  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  4  and  5  of  this  Article,  from 
designated  permanent  storage  sites  only  after  notification 
has  been  provided  to  all  other  States  Parties  at  least  42  days 
prior  to  such  removal.  This  notification  shall  specify: 

(A)  the  locations  of  the  designated  permanent  storage 
sites  from  which  armoured  vehicle  launched  bridges 
are  to  be  removed  and  the  numbers  of  armoured 
vehicle  launched  bridges  to  be  removed  from  each 
such  site; 

(B)  the  dates  of  removal  of  armoured  vehicle  launched 
bridges  from  and  return  to  designated  permanent 
storage  sites;  and

and  regulations  or  other  conditions  governing  the  inspection 
activities  set  forth  in  this  Protocol,  it  shall  so  notify  the 
inspecting  State  Party,  which  upon  the  request  of  the 
inspected  State  Party  shall  immediately  delete  the  name  of 
the  individual  from  the  list  of  inspectors  or  transport  crew

provided  by  the  inspected  State  Party.  The  inspected  State 
Party  shall  also  provide  means  of  communication  between 
the  sub-teams  of  an  inspection  team. 

12.  The  inspected  State  Party  shall  transport  the 
inspection  team  to,  from  and  between  inspection  sites  by  a 
means  and  route  selected  by  the  inspected  State  Party.  The 
inspecting  State  Party  may  request  a  variation  in  the  selected 
route.  The  inspected  State  Party  shall  if  possible  grant  such  a 
request.  Whenever  mutually  agreed,  the  inspecting  State 
Party  will  be  permitted  to  use  its  own  land  vehicles.

inspectors  from  an  inspection  site  to  a  point  of  entry/exit  or 
to  the  embassy  or  consulate  of  the  inspecting  State  Party  on 
the  territory  of  the  State  Party  where  an  inspection  is  carried

Party.  Throughout  the  in-country  period,  the  escort  team 
shall  have  the  right  to  observe  the  equipment  brought  by 
inspectors,  but  shall  not  interfere  with  the  use  of  equipment 


that  has  been  approved  by  the  escort  team  in  accordance 
with  Section  V,  paragraphs  5  to  7  of  this  Protocol. 

16.  In  the  case  of  an  inspection  conducted  pursuant  to 
Section  VII  or  VIII  of  this  Protocol,  the  inspection  team  shall 
specify  on  each  occasion  it  designates  the  inspection  site  to 
be  inspected  whether  the  inspection  will  be  conducted  on 
foot,  by  cross-country  vehicle,  by  helicopter  or  by  any 
combination  of  these.  Unless  otherwise  agreed,  the  inspected 
State  Party  shall  provide  and  operate  the  appropriate  cross¬ 
country  vehicles  at  the  inspection  site. 

17.  Whenever  possible,  subject  to  the  safety 
requirements  and  flight  regulations  of  the  inspected  State 
Party  and  subject  to  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  18  to  21  of 
this  Section,  the  inspection  team  shall  have  the  right  to 
conduct  helicopter  overflights  of  the  inspection  site,  using  a 
helicopter  provided  and  operated  by  the  inspected  State 
Party,  during  inspections  conducted  pursuant  to  Sections  VII 
and  VIII  of  this  Protocol. 

18.  The  inspected  State  Party  shall  not  be  obliged  to

square  kilometres  in  area. 

19.  The  inspected  State  Party  shall  have  the  right  to 
delay,  limit  or  refuse  helicopter  overflights  above  sensitive 
points,  but  the  presence  of  sensitive  points  shall  not  prevent 
helicopter  overflight  of  the  remaining  areas  of  the  inspection 
site.  Photography  of  or  above  sensitive  points  during 
helicopter  overflights  shall  be  permitted  only  with  the 
approval  of  the  escort  team. 

20.  The  duration  of  such  helicopter  overflights  at  an 
inspection  site  shall  not  exceed  a  cumulative  total  of  one 
hour,  unless  otherwise  agreed  between  the  inspection  team 
and  the  escort  team. 

21.  Any  helicopter  provided  by  the  inspected  State  Party 
shall  be  large  enough  to  carry  at  least  two  members  of  the 
inspection  team  and  at  least  one  member  of  the  escort  team. 
Inspectors  shall  be  allowed  to  take  and  use  on  overflights  of 
the  inspection  site  any  of  the  equipment  specified  in 
paragraph  15  of  this  Section.  The  inspection  team  shall 
advise  the  escort  team  during  inspection  flights  whenever  it 
intends  to  take  photographs.  A  helicopter  shall  afford  the 
inspectors  a  constant  and  unobstructed  view  of  the  ground. 

22.  In  discharging  their  functions,  inspectors  shall  not 
interfere  directly  with  ongoing  activities  at  the  inspection  site 
and  shall  avoid  unnecessarily  hampering  or  delaying 
operations  at  the  inspection  site  or  taking  actions  affecting 
safe  operation. 

23.  Except  as  provided  for  in  paragraphs  24  to  29  of  this 
Section,  during  an  inspection  of  an  object  of  verification  or 
within  a  specified  area,  inspectors  shall  be  permitted  access, 
entry  and  unobstructed  inspection: 

(A)  in  the  case  of  a  specified  area,  within  the  entire 
specified  area;  or 

(B)  in  the  case  of  an  object  of  verification,  within  the 
entire  territory  of  the  declared  site  except  within 
those  areas  delineated  on  the  site  diagram  as

designated,  or  shrouded  objects  or  containers  are  present, 
the  escort  team  shall  declare  whether  the  sensitive  point, 
shrouded  object  or  container  holds  any  battle  tanks,

30.  If,  during  an  inspection  of  an  object  of  verification 
or  within  a  specified  area  pursuant  to  Section  VII  or  VIII  of 
this  Protocol,  a  helicopter  of  a  type  that  is  or  has  been  on 
the  multi-purpose  attack  helicopter  list  in  the  Protocol  on 
Existing  Types  is  present  at  an  inspection  site  and  is 
declared  by  the  escort  team  to  be  a  combat  support 
helicopter,  or  if  an  Mi-24R  or  Mi-24K  helicopter  is  present 
at  an  inspection  site  and  is  declared  by  the  escort  team  to  be 
limited  pursuant  to  Section  I,  paragraph  3  of  the  Protocol

32.  If,  during  an  inspection  of  an  object  of  verification 
or  within  a  specified  area  pursuant  to  Section  VII  or  VIII  of 
this  Protocol,  an  armoured  vehicle  declared  by  the  escort 
team  to  be  an  armoured  personnel  carrier  look-alike  or  an 
armoured  infantry  fighting  vehicle  look-alike  is  present  at 
an  inspection  site,  the  inspection  team  shall  have  the  right  to 
determine  that  such  vehicle  cannot  permit  the  transport  of  a 
combat  infantry  squad.  Inspectors  shall  have  the  right  to 
require  the  doors  and/or  hatches  of  the  vehicle  to  be  opened 
so  that  the  interior  can  be  visually  inspected  from  outside 
the  vehicle.  Sensitive  equipment  in  or  on  the  vehicle  may  be 
shrouded. 

33.  If,  during  an  inspection  of  an  object  of  verification 
or  within  a  specified  area  pursuant  to  Section  VII  or  VIII  of 
this  Protocol,  items  of  equipment  declared  by  the  escort

conventional  armaments  and  equipment.  Still  cameras  shall 
be  limited  to  35mm  cameras  and  to  cameras  capable  of 
producing  instantly  developed  photographic  prints.  The 
inspection  team  shall  advise  the  escort  team  in  advance 
whether  it  plans  to  take  photographs.  The  escort  team  shall 
cooperate  with  the  inspection  team’s  taking  of  photographs.

35.  Photography  of  sensitive  points  shall  be  permitted 
only  with  the  approval  of  the  escort  team. 

36.  Except  as  provided  for  in  paragraph  38  of  this 
Section,  photography  of  interiors  of  structures  other  than 
storage  sites  specified  in  paragraph  34  of  this  Section  shall 
be  permitted  only  with  the  approval  of  the  escort  team. 

37.  Inspectors  shall  have  the  right  to  take  measurements 
to  resolve  ambiguities  that  might  arise  during  inspections. 
Such  measurements  recorded  during  inspections  shall  be 
confirmed  by  a  member  of  the  inspection  team  and  a 
member  of  the  escort  team  immediately  after  they  are  taken. 
Such  confirmed  data  shall  be  included  in  the  inspection 
report. 

38.  States  Parties  shall,  whenever  possible,  resolve  during 
an  inspection  any  ambiguities  that  arise  regarding  factual 
information.  Whenever  inspectors  request  the  escort  team  to 
clarify  such  an  ambiguity,  the  escort  team  shall  promptly 
provide  the  inspection  team  with  clarifications.  If  inspectors 
decide  to  document  an  unresolved  ambiguity  with 
photographs,  the  escort  team  shall,  subject  to  the  provision 
in  paragraph  35  of  this  Section,  cooperate  with  the 
inspection  team’s  taking  of  appropriate  photographs  using  a 
camera  capable  of  producing  instantly  developed 
photographic  prints.  If  an  ambiguity  cannot  be  resolved 
during  the  inspection,  then  the  question,  relevant 
clarifications  and  any  pertinent  photographs  shall  be 
included  in  the  inspection  report  in  accordance  with  Section 
XII  of  this  Protocol. 

39.  For  inspections  conducted  pursuant  to  Sections  VII 
and  VIII  of  this  Protocol,  the  inspection  shall  be  deemed  to 
have  been  completed  once  the  inspection  report  has  been 
signed  and  countersigned. 

40.  No  later  than  completion  of  an  inspection  at  a 
declared  site  or  within  a  specified  area,  the  inspection  team 
shall  inform  the  escort  team  whether  the  inspection  team 
intends  to  conduct  a  sequential  inspection.  If  the  inspection 
team  intends  to  conduct  a  sequential  inspection,  the 
inspection  team  shall  designate  at  that  time  the  next 
inspection  site.  In  such  cases,  subject  to  the  provisions  in 
Section  VII,  paragraphs  6  and  17  and  Section  VIII, 
paragraph  6,  subparagraph  (A)  of  this  Protocol,  the 
inspected  State  Party  shall  ensure  that  the  inspection  team 
arrives  at  the  sequential  inspection  site  as  soon  as  possible 
after  completion  of  the  previous  inspection.  If  the  inspection 
team  does  not  intend  to  conduct  a  sequential  inspection, 
then  the  provisions  in  paragraphs  42  and  43  of  this  Section 
shall  apply. 

41.  An  inspection  team  shall  have  the  right  to  conduct  a 
sequential  inspection,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  Sections 
VII  and  VIII  of  this  Protocol,  on  the  territory  of  the  State 
Party  on  which  that  inspection  team  has  conducted  the 
preceding  inspection: 

(A)  at  any  declared  site  associated  with  the  same  point  of 
entry/exit  as  the  preceding  inspection  site  or  the  same 
point  of  entry/exit  at  which  the  inspection  team 
arrived;  or 

(B)  within  any  specified  area  for  which  the  point  of 
entry/exit  at  which  the  inspection  team  arrived  is  the 
nearest  point  of  entry/exit  notified  pursuant  to 


Section  V  of  the  Protocol  on  Information  Exchange; 
or 

(C)  at  any  location  within  200  kilometres  of  the 
preceding  inspection  site  within  the  same  military 
district;  or 

(D)  at  the  location  which  the  inspected  State  Party 
claims,  pursuant  to  Section  VII,  paragraph  11, 
subparagraph  (A)  of  this  Protocol,  is  the  temporary 
location  of  battle  tanks,  armoured  combat  vehicles, 
artillery,  combat  helicopters,  combat  aircraft  or 
armoured  vehicle  launched  bridges  which  were 
absent  during  inspection  of  an  object  of  verification 
at  the  preceding  inspection  site,  if  such  conventional 
armaments  and  equipment  constitute  more  than  15 
percent  of  the  number  of  such  conventional 
armaments  and  equipment  notified  in  the  most 
recent  notification  pursuant  to  the  Protocol  on 
Information  Exchange;  or 

(E)  at  the  declared  site  which  the  inspected  State  Party 
claims,  pursuant  to  Section  VII,  paragraph  11, 
subparagraph  (B)  of  this  Protocol,  is  the  site  of  origin 
for  battle  tanks,  armoured  combat  vehicles,  artillery, 
combat  helicopters,  combat  aircraft  or  armoured 
vehicle  launched  bridges  at  the  preceding  inspection 
site  which  are  in  excess  of  the  number  provided  in 
the  most  recent  notification  pursuant  to  the  Protocol 
on  Information  Exchange  as  being  present  at  that 
preceding  inspection  site,  if  such  conventional 
armaments  and  equipment  exceed  by  15  percent  the 
number  of  such  conventional  armaments  and 
equipment  so  notified. 

42.  After  completion  of  an  inspection  at  a  declared  site 
or  within  a  specified  area,  if  no  sequential  inspection  has 
been  declared,  then  the  inspection  team  shall  be  transported 
to  the  appropriate  point  of  entry/exit  as  soon  as  possible  and 
shall  depart  the  territory  of  the  State  Party  where  the 
inspection  was  carried  out  within  24  hours. 

43.  The  inspection  team  shall  leave  the  territory  of  the 
State  Party  where  it  has  been  conducting  inspections  from 
the  same  point  of  entry/exit  at  which  it  entered,  unless 
otherwise  agreed.  If  an  inspection  team  chooses  to  proceed 
to  a  point  of  entry/exit  on  the  territory  of  another  State 
Party  for  the  purpose  of  conducting  inspections,  it  shall  have 
the  right  to  do  so  provided  that  the  inspecting  State  Party 
has  provided  the  necessary  notification  in  accordance  with 
Section  IV,  paragraph  1  of  this  Protocol. 

SECTION  VII.  DECLARED  SITE  INSPECTION 

1.  Inspection  of  a  declared  site  pursuant  to  this 
Protocol  shall  not  be  refused.  Such  inspections  may  be 
delayed  only  in  cases  of  force  majeure  or  in  accordance  with 
Section  II,  paragraphs  7  and  20  to  22  of  this  Protocol. 

2.  Except  as  provided  for  in  paragraph  3  of  this 
Section,  an  inspection  team  shall  arrive  on  the  territory  of 
the  State  Party  where  an  inspection  is  to  be  carried  out 
through  a  point  of  entry/exit  associated  under  Section  V  of 
the  Protocol  on  Information  Exchange  with  the  declared  site 
it  plans  to  designate  as  the  first  inspection  site  pursuant  to 
paragraph  7  of  this  Section. 


Appendix  A:  Treaty  on  Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe  305 


3.  If  an  inspecting  State  Party  desires  to  use  a  ground 
border  crossing  point  or  seaport  as  a  point  of  entry/exit  and 
the  inspected  State  Party  has  not  previously  notified  a 
ground  border  crossing  point  or  seaport  as  a  point  of  entry/ 
exit  pursuant  to  Section  V  of  the  Protocol  on  Information 
Exchange  as  associated  with  the  declared  site  the  inspecting 
State  Party  desires  to  designate  as  the  first  inspection  site 
pursuant  to  paragraph  7  of  this  Section,  the  inspecting  State 
Party  shall  indicate  in  the  notification  provided  pursuant  to 
Section  IV,  paragraph  2  of  this  Protocol  the  desired  ground 
border  crossing  point  or  seaport  as  point  of  entry/exit.  The 
inspected  State  Party  shall  indicate  in  its  acknowledgement 
of  receipt  of  notification,  as  provided  for  in  Section  IV, 
paragraph  4  of  this  Protocol,  whether  this  point  of  entry/exit 
is  acceptable  or  not.  In  the  latter  case,  the  inspected  State 
Party  shall  notify  the  inspecting  State  Party  of  another  point 
of  entry/exit  which  shall  be  as  near  as  possible  to  the  desired 
point  of  entry/exit  and  which  may  be  an  airport  notified 
pursuant  to  Section  V  of  the  Protocol  on  Information 
Exchange,  a  seaport  or  a  ground  border  crossing  point 
through  which  the  inspection  team  and  transport  crew 
members  may  arrive  on  its  territory. 

4.  If  an  inspecting  State  Party  notifies  its  desire  to  use  a 
ground  border  crossing  point  or  seaport  as  a  point  of  entry/ 
exit  pursuant  to  paragraph  3  of  this  Section,  it  shall 
determine  prior  to  such  notification  that  there  is  reasonable 
certainty  that  its  inspection  team  can  reach  the  first  declared 
site  where  that  State  Party  desires  to  carry  out  an  inspection 
within  the  time  specified  in  paragraph  8  of  this  Section  using 
ground  transportation  means. 

5.  If  an  inspection  team  and  transport  crew  arrive 
pursuant  to  paragraph  3  of  this  Section  on  the  territory  of 
the  State  Party  on  which  an  inspection  is  to  be  carried  out 
through  a  point  of  entry/exit  other  than  a  point  of  entry/exit 
that  was  notified  pursuant  to  Section  V  of  the  Protocol  on 
Information  Exchange  as  being  associated  with  the  declared 
site  it  desires  to  designate  as  the  first  inspection  site,  the 
inspected  State  Party  shall  facilitate  access  to  this  declared 
site  as  expeditiously  as  possible,  but  shall  be  permitted  to 
exceed,  if  necessary,  the  time  limit  specified  in  paragraph  8 
of  this  Section. 

6.  The  inspected  State  Party  shall  have  the  right  to 
utilise  up  to  six  hours  after  designation  of  a  declared  site  to 
prepare  for  the  arrival  of  the  inspection  team  at  that  site. 

7.  At  the  number  of  hours  after  arrival  at  the  point  of 
entry/exit  notified  pursuant  to  Section  IV,  paragraph  2, 
subparagraph  (E)  of  this  Protocol,  which  shall  be  no  less 
than  one  hour  and  no  more  than  16  hours  after  arrival  at  the 
point  of  entry/exit,  the  inspection  team  shall  designate  the 
first  declared  site  to  be  inspected. 

8.  The  inspected  State  Party  shall  ensure  that  the 
inspection  team  travels  to  the  first  declared  site  by  the  most 
expeditious  means  available  and  arrives  as  soon  as  possible 
but  no  later  than  nine  hours  after  the  designation  of  the  site 
to  be  inspected,  unless  otherwise  agreed  between  the 
inspection  team  and  the  escort  team,  or  unless  the  inspection 
site  is  located  in  mountainous  terrain  or  terrain  to  which 
access  is  difficult.  In  such  case,  the  inspection  team  shall  be 
transported  to  the  inspection  site  no  later  than  15  hours 
after  designation  of  that  inspection  site.  Travel  time  in  excess 


of  nine  hours  shall  not  count  against  that  inspection  team’s 
in-country  period. 

9.  Immediately  upon  arrival  at  the  declared  site,  the 
inspection  team  shall  be  escorted  to  a  briefing  facility  where 
it  shall  be  provided  with  a  diagram  of  the  declared  site, 
unless  such  a  diagram  has  been  provided  in  a  previous 
exchange  of  site  diagrams.  The  declared  site  diagram, 
provided  upon  arrival  at  the  declared  site,  shall  contain  an 
accurate  depiction  of  the: 

(A)  geographic  coordinates  of  a  point  within  the 
inspection  site,  to  the  nearest  10  seconds,  with 
indication  of  that  point  and  of  true  north; 

(B)  scale  used  in  the  site  diagram; 

(C)  perimeter  of  the  declared  site;

each  object  of  verification  to  which  each  such  area 
belongs  and  including  those  separately  located  areas 
where  battle  tanks,  armoured  combat  vehicles, 
artillery,  combat  aircraft,  combat  helicopters, 
reclassified  combat-capable  trainer  aircraft, 
armoured  personnel  carrier  look-alikes,  armoured 
infantry  fighting  vehicle  look-alikes  or  armoured 
vehicle  launched  bridges  belonging  to  each  object  of 
verification  are  permanently  assigned; 

(E)  major  buildings  and  roads  on  the  declared  site; 

(F)  entrances  to  the  declared  site;  and

provided  in  the  most  recent  notification  pursuant  to  the 
Protocol  on  Information  Exchange,  in  accordance  with  the 
following  provisions: 

(A)  if  the  numbers  of  such  conventional  armaments  and 
equipment  present  at  the  inspection  site  are  less  than 
the  numbers  provided  in  that  most  recent 
notification,  such  explanation  shall  include  the 
temporary  location  of  such  conventional  armaments 
and  equipment;  and 

(B)  if  the  numbers  of  such  armaments  and  equipment 
present  at  the  inspection  site  exceed  the  numbers 
provided  in  that  most  recent  notification,  such 
explanation  shall  include  specific  information  on  the 
origin,  departure  times  from  origin,  time  of  arrival 
and  projected  stay  at  the  inspection  site  of  such 
additional  conventional  armaments  and  equipment. 

12.  When  an  inspection  team  designates  an  object  of 
verification  to  be  inspected,  the  inspection  team  shall  have 
the  right,  as  part  of  the  same  inspection  of  that  object  of 
verification,  to  inspect  all  territory  delineated  on  the  site 
diagram  as  belonging  to  that  object  of  verification,  including 
those  separately  located  areas  on  the  territory  of  the  same 
State  Party  where  conventional  armaments  and  equipment 
belonging  to  that  object  of  verification  are  permanently 
assigned. 

13.  The  inspection  of  one  object  of  verification  at  a 
declared  site  shall  permit  the  inspection  team  access,  entry 
and  unobstructed  inspection  within  the  entire  territory  of  the 
declared  site  except  within  those  areas  delineated  on  the  site 
diagram  as  belonging  exclusively  to  another  object  of 
verification  which  the  inspection  team  has  not  designated  for 
inspection.  During  such  inspections,  the  provisions  of 
Section  VI  of  this  Protocol  shall  apply. 

14.  If  the  escort  team  informs  the  inspection  team  that 
battle  tanks,  armoured  combat  vehicles,  artillery,  combat 
helicopters,  combat  aircraft,  reclassified  combat-capable 
trainer  aircraft,  armoured  personnel  carrier  look-alikes, 
armoured  infantry  fighting  vehicle  look-alikes  or  armoured 
vehicle  launched  bridges  that  have  been  notified  as  being 
held  by  one  object  of  verification  at  a  declared  site  are 
present  within  an  area  delineated  on  the  site  diagram  as 
belonging  exclusively  to  another  object  of  verification,  then 
the  escort  team  shall  ensure  that  the  inspection  team,  as  part 
of  the  same  inspection,  has  access  to  such  conventional 
armaments  and  equipment. 

15.  If  conventional  armaments  and  equipment  limited  by 
the  Treaty  or  armoured  vehicle  launched  bridges  are  present 
within  areas  of  a  declared  site  not  delineated  on  the  site 
diagram  as  belonging  exclusively  to  one  object  of 
verification,  the  escort  team  shall  inform  the  inspection  team 
to  which  object  of  verification  such  conventional  armaments 
and  equipment  belong. 

16.  Each  State  Party  shall  be  obliged  to  account  for  the 
aggregate  total  of  any  category  of  conventional  armaments 
and  equipment  limited  by  the  Treaty  notified  pursuant  to 
Section  III  of  the  Protocol  on  Information  Exchange,  at  the 
organisational  level  above  brigade/regiment  or  equivalent,  if 
such  an  accounting  is  requested  by  another  State  Party. 


17.  If,  during  an  inspection  at  a  declared  site,  the 
inspection  team  decides  to  conduct  at  the  same  declared  site 
an  inspection  of  an  object  of  verification  that  had  not  been 
previously  designated,  the  inspection  team  shall  have  the 
right  to  commence  such  inspection  within  three  hours  of  that 
designation.  In  such  case,  the  inspection  team  shall  be  given 
a  briefing  on  the  object  of  verification  designated  for  the 
next  inspection  in  accordance  with  paragraphs  10  and  1 1  of 
this  Section. 

SECTION  VIII.  CHALLENGE  INSPECTION  WITHIN 
SPECIFIED  AREAS 

1.  Each  State  Party  shall  have  the  right  to  conduct 
challenge  inspections  within  specified  areas  in  accordance 
with  this  Protocol. 

2.  If  the  inspecting  State  Party  intends  to  conduct  a 
challenge  inspection  within  a  specified  area  as  the 
first  inspection  after  arrival  at  a  point  of  entry/exit: 

(A)  it  shall  include  in  its  notification  pursuant  to  Section 
IV  of  this  Protocol  the  designated  point  of  entry/exit 
nearest  to  or  within  that  specified  area  capable  of 
receiving  the  inspecting  State  Party’s  chosen  means  of 
transportation;  and 

(B)  at  the  number  of  hours  after  arrival  at  the  point  of 
entry/exit  notified  pursuant  to  Section  IV,  paragraph 
2,  subparagraph  (E) of  this  Protocol,  which  shall  be 
no  less  than  one  hour  and  no  more  than  16  hours 
after  arrival  at  the  point  of  entry/exit,  the  inspection 
team  shall  designate  the  first  specified  area  it  wishes 
to  inspect.  Whenever  a  specified  area  is  designated, 
the  inspection  team  shall,  as  part  of  its  inspection 
request,  provide  to  the  escort  team  a  geographic 
description  delineating  the  outer  boundaries  of  that 
area.  The  inspection  team  shall  have  the  right,  as 
part  of  that  request,  to  identify  any  structure  or 
facility  it  wishes  to  inspect. 

3.  The  State  Party  on  whose  territory  a  challenge 
inspection  is  requested  shall,  immediately  upon  receiving  a 
designation  of  a  specified  area,  inform  other  States  Parties 
which  utilise  structures  or  premises  by  agreement  with  the 
inspected  State  Party  of  that  specified  area,  including  its 
geographic  description  delineating  the  outer  boundaries. 

4.  The  inspected  State  Party  shall  have  the  right  to 
refuse  challenge  inspections  within  specified  areas. 

5.  The  inspected  State  Party  shall  inform  the  inspection 
team  within  two  hours  after  the  designation  of  a  specified 
area  whether  the  inspection  request  will  be  granted. 

6.  If  access  to  a  specified  area  is  granted: 

(A)  the  inspected  State  Party  shall  have  the  right  to  use 
up  to  six  hours  after  it  accepts  the  inspection  to 
prepare  for  the  arrival  of  the  inspection  team  at  the 
specified  area; 

(B)  the  inspected  State  Party  shall  ensure  that  the 
inspection  team  travels  to  the  first  specified  area  by 
the  most  expeditious  means  available  and  arrives  as 
soon  as  possible  after  the  designation  of  the  site  to  be 
inspected,  but  no  later  than  nine  hours  from  the  time 


Appendix  A:  Treaty  on  Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe  307 


such  an  inspection  is  accepted,  unless  otherwise 
agreed  between  the  inspection  team  and  the  escort 
team,  or  unless  the  inspection  site  is  located  in 
mountainous  terrain  or  terrain  to  which  access  is 
difficult.  In  such  case,  the  inspection  team  shall  be 
transported  to  the  inspection  site  no  later  than  15 
hours  after  such  an  inspection  is  accepted.  Travel 
time  in  excess  of  nine  hours  shall  not  count  against 
that  inspection  team’s  in-country  period;  and 

(C)  the  provisions  of  Section  VI  of  this  Protocol  shall 
apply.  Within  such  specified  area  the  escort  team 
may  delay  access  to  or  overflight  of  particular  parts 
of  that  specified  area.  If  the  delay  exceeds  more  than 
four  hours  the  inspection  team  shall  have  the  right  to 
cancel  the  inspection.  The  period  of  delay  shall  not 
count  against  the  in-country  period  or  the  maximum 
time  allowed  within  a  specified  area. 

7.  If  an  inspection  team  requests  access  to  a  structure  or 
premises  which  another  State  Party  utilises  by  agreement 
with  the  inspected  State  Party,  the  inspected  State  Party  shall 
immediately  inform  that  State  Party  of  such  a  request.  The 
escort  team  shall  inform  the  inspection  team  that  the  other 
State  Party,  by  agreement  with  the  inspected  State  Party, 
shall,  in  cooperation  with  the  inspected  State  Party  and  to 
the  extent  consistent  with  the  agreement  on  utilisation, 
exercise  the  rights  and  obligations  set  forth  in  this  Protocol 
with  respect  to  inspections  involving  equipment  or  materiel 
of  the  State  Party  utilising  the  structure  or  premises. 

8.  If  the  inspected  State  Party  so  wishes,  the  inspection 
team  may  be  briefed  on  arrival  at  the  specified  area.  This 
briefing  is  to  last  no  more  than  one  hour.  Safety  procedures 
and  administrative  arrangements  may  also  be  covered  in  this 
briefing. 

9.  If  access  to  a  specified  area  is  denied: 

(A)  the  inspected  State  Party  or  the  State  Party  exercising 
the  rights  and  obligations  of  the  inspected  State  Party 
shall  provide  all  reasonable  assurance  that  the 
specified  area  does  not  contain  conventional 
armaments  and  equipment  limited  by  the  Treaty.  If 
such  armaments  and  equipment  are  present  and 
assigned  to  organisations  designed  and  structured  to 
perform  in  peacetime  internal  security  functions  in 
the  area  defined  in  Article  V  of  the  Treaty,  the 
inspected  State  Party  or  the  State  Party  exercising  the 
rights  and  obligations  of  the  inspected  State  Party 
shall  allow  visual  confirmation  of  their  presence, 
unless  precluded  from  so  doing  by  force  majeure,  in 
which  case  visual  confirmation  shall  be  allowed  as 
soon  as  practicable;  and 

(B)  no  inspection  quota  shall  be  counted,  and  the  time 
between  the  designation  of  the  specified  area  and  its 
subsequent  refusal  shall  not  count  against  the  in¬ 
country  period.  The  inspection  team  shall  have  the 
right  to  designate  another  specified  area  or  declared 
site  for  inspection  or  to  declare  the  inspection 
concluded. 

SECTION  IX.  INSPECTION  OF  CERTIFICATION 

1.  Each  State  Party  shall  have  the  right  to  inspect,

visually  the  helicopter  or  aircraft  cockpit  and  interior  to 
include  checking  the  manufacturer’s  serial  number,  without 
right  of  refusal  on  the  part  of  the  State  Party  conducting  the 
certification. 

5.  If  requested  by  the  inspection  team,  the  escort  team 
shall  remove,  without  right  of  refusal,  any  access  panels 
covering  the  position  from  which  components  and  wiring

territory  of  the  inspected  State  Party  or  to  conduct  a 
sequential  inspection  at  another  certification  site  or  at  a 
reduction  site  if  the  appropriate  notification  has  been 
provided  by  the  inspection  team  in  accordance  with  Section 
IV,  paragraph  3  of  this  Protocol.  The  inspection  team  shall 
notify  the  escort  team  of  its  intended  departure  from  the 
certification  site  and,  if  appropriate,  of  its  intention  to 
proceed  to  another  certification  site  or  to  a  reduction  site  at 
least  24  hours  before  the  intended  departure  time. 

9.  Within  seven  days  after  completion  of  the

State  Party,  of  the  process  of  reduction  carried  out  pursuant 
to  Sections  I  to  VIII  and  X  to  XII  of  the  Protocol  on 
Reduction  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this  Section. 
Such  inspections  shall  not  count  against  the  quotas 
established  in  Section  II  of  this  Protocol.  Inspection  teams 
conducting  such  inspections  may  be  composed  of 
representatives  of  different  States  Parties.  The  inspected  State

only  to  the  provisions  set  forth  in  Article  VIII  of  the  Treaty 
and  in  the  Protocol  on  Reduction.  Inspections  of  the  process 
of  reduction  shall  be  conducted  in  a  manner  that  does  not 
interfere  with  the  ongoing  activities  at  the  reduction  site  or 
unnecessarily  hamper,  delay  or  complicate  the 
implementation  of  the  process  of  reduction. 

3.  If  a  reduction  site  notified  pursuant  to  Section  III  of 
the  Protocol  on  Information  Exchange  is  used  by  more  than 
one  State  Party,  inspections  of  the  reduction  process  shall  be 
conducted  in  accordance  with  schedules  of  such  use 
provided  by  each  State  Party  using  the  reduction  site. 

4.  Each  State  Party  that  intends  to  reduce  conventional 
armaments  and  equipment  limited  by  the  Treaty  shall  notify 
all  other  States  Parties  which  conventional  armaments  and

calendar  reporting  period.  Each  such  calendar  reporting 
period  shall  have  a  duration  of  no  more  than  90  days  and  no 
less  than  30  days.  This  provision  shall  apply  whenever 
reduction  is  carried  out  at  a  reduction  site,  without  regard  to 
whether  the  reduction  process  is  to  be  carried  out  on  a 
continuous  or  intermittent  basis. 

5.  No  less  than  15  days  before  the  initiation  of

arrive  at  the  point  of  entry/exit  in  order  to  inspect 
the  conventional  armaments  and  equipment  before 
the  initiation  of  their  reduction. 

6.  Except  as  specified  in  paragraph  11  of  this  Section, 
an  inspection  team  shall  have  the  right  to  arrive  at  or  depart 
from  a  reduction  site  at  any  time  during  the  calendar 
reporting  period,  including  three  days  beyond  the  end  of  a 
notified  calendar  reporting  period.  In  addition,  the 
inspection  team  shall  have  the  right  to  remain  at  the 
reduction  site  throughout  one  or  more  calendar  reporting 
periods  provided  that  these  periods  are  not  separated  by 
more  than  three  days.  Throughout  the  period  that  the 
inspection  team  remains  at  the  reduction  site,  it  shall  have 
the  right  to  observe  all  the  reduction  procedures  carried  out 
in  accordance  with  the  Protocol  on  Reduction. 

7.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  set  forth  in  this 
Section,  the  inspection  team  shall  have  the  right  to  freely 
record  factory  serial  numbers  from  the  conventional 
armaments  and  equipment  to  be  reduced  or  to  place  special 
marks  on  such  equipment  before  reduction  and  to  record 
subsequently  such  numbers  or  marks  at  the  completion  of 
the  reduction  process.  Parts  and  elements  of  reduced 
conventional  armaments  and  equipment  as  specified  in 
Section  II,  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  the  Protocol  on  Reduction 
or,  in  the  case  of  conversion,  the  vehicles  converted  for  non¬ 
military  purposes  shall  be  available  for  inspection  for  at  least 
three  days  after  the  end  of  the  notified  calendar  reporting 
period,  unless  inspection  of  those  reduced  elements  has  been 
completed  earlier. 

8.  The  State  Party  engaged  in  the  process  of  reducing 
conventional  armaments  and  equipment  limited  by  the 
Treaty  shall  establish  at  each  reduction  site  a  working 
register  in  which  it  shall  record  the  factory  serial  numbers  of 
each  item  undergoing  reduction  as  well  as  the  dates  on 
which  the  reduction  procedures  were  initiated  and 
completed.  This  register  shall  also  include  aggregate  data  for 
each  calendar  reporting  period.  The  register  shall  be  made 
available  to  the  inspection  team  for  the  period  of  inspection.

10.  Upon  completion  of  an  inspection  at  a  reduction  site, 
the  inspection  team  shall  have  the  right  to  depart  the 
territory  of  the  inspected  State  Party  or  to  conduct  a 
sequential  inspection  at  another  reduction  site  or  at  a 
certification  site  if  the  appropriate  notification  has  been 
provided  in  accordance  with  Section  IV,  paragraph  3  of  this 
Protocol.  The  inspection  team  shall  notify  the  escort  team  of 
its  intended  departure  from  the  reduction  site  and,  if 
appropriate,  of  its  intention  to  proceed  to  another  reduction 
site  or  to  a  certification  site  at  least  24  hours  before  the 
intended  departure  time. 

11.  Each  State  Party  shall  be  obliged  to  accept  up  to  10 
inspections  each  year  to  validate  the  completion  of 
conversion  of  conventional  armaments  and  equipment  into 
vehicles  for  non-military  purposes  pursuant  to  Section  VIII  of

personal  benefit,  inspectors  and  transport  crew  members 
shall  be  accorded  the  privileges  and  immunities  enjoyed  by 
diplomatic  agents  pursuant  to  Article  29;  Article  30, 
paragraph  2;  Article  31,  paragraphs  1,  2  and  3;  and  Articles 
34  and  35  of  the  Vienna  Convention  on  Diplomatic 
Relations  of  April  18,  1961. 

2.  In  addition,  inspectors  and  transport  crew  members 
shall  be  accorded  the  privileges  enjoyed  by  diplomatic  agents 
pursuant  to  Article  36,  paragraph  1,  subparagraph  (b)  of 
the  Vienna  Convention  on  Diplomatic  Relations  of  April  18, 
1961.  They  shall  not  be  permitted  to  bring  into  the  territory 
of  the  State  Party  where  the  inspection  is  to  be  carried  out 
articles  the  import  or  export  of  which  is  prohibited  by  law 
or  controlled  by  quarantine  regulations  of  that  State  Party. 

3.  The  transportation  means  of  the  inspection  team 
shall  be  inviolable,  except  as  otherwise  provided  for  in  the

4.  The  inspecting  State  Party  may  waive  the  immunity 
from  jurisdiction  of  any  of  its  inspectors  or  transport  crew 
members  in  those  cases  when  it  is  of  the  opinion  that 
immunity  would  impede  the  course  of  justice  and  that  it  can 
be  waived  without  prejudice  to  the  implementation  of  the 


provisions  of  the  Treaty.  The  immunity  of  inspectors  and 
transport  crew  members  who  are  not  nationals  of  the 
inspecting  State  Party  may  be  waived  only  by  the  States 
Parties  of  which  those  inspectors  are  nationals.  Waiver  must 
always  be  express.

in  the  exercise  of  official  functions  as  an  inspector  or 
transport  crew  member. 

6.  If  the  inspected  State  Party  considers  that  an 
inspector  or  transport  crew  member  has  abused  his  or  her 
privileges  and  immunities,  then  the  provisions  set  forth  in 
Section  VI,  paragraph  6  of  this  Protocol  shall  apply.  At  the 
request  of  any  of  the  States  Parties  concerned,  consultations 
shall  be  held  between  them  in  order  to  prevent  a  repetition 
of  such  an  abuse.

In  connection  with  the  signature  of  the  Treaty  on 
Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe  of  November  19, 
1990,  and  with  a  view  to  the  follow-on  negotiations  referred

strength  of  their  conventional  armed  forces  pursuant  to  the 
Mandate  in  the  area  of  application. 

DECLARATION  BY  THE  GOVERNMENT  OF 
THE  FEDERAL  REPUBLIC  OF  GERMANY 
ON  THE  PERSONNEL  STRENGTH  OF 
GERMAN  ARMED  FORCES 

In  connection  with  the  signature  of  the  Treaty  on 
Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe,  the  Government  of 
the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  confirms  the  declaration 
made  by  the  Federal  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  on  30 
August  1990  in  the  plenary  session  of  the  Negotiations  on 
Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe,  which  reads  as 
follows: 

“The  Government  of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany 
undertakes  to  reduce  the  personnel  strength  of  the  armed 
forces  of  the  united  Germany  to  370,000  (ground,  air  and 
naval  forces)  within  three  to  four  years.  This  reduction  will 
commence  on  the  entry  into  force  of  the  first  CFE 
agreement. 

Within  the  scope  of  this  overall  ceiling  no  more  than 
345,000  will  belong  to  the  ground  and  air  forces  which, 
pursuant  to  the  agreed  mandate,  alone  are  the  subject  of  the 
Negotiations  on  Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe. 

The  Federal  Government  regards  its  commitment  to 
reduce  ground  and  air  forces  as  a  significant  German 
contribution  to  the  reduction  of  conventional  armed  forces 
in  Europe.  It  assumes  that  in  follow-on  negotiations  the 
other  participants  in  the  negotiations,  too,  will  render  their 
contribution  to  enhancing  security  and  stability  in  Europe, 
including  measures  to  limit  personnel  strengths.”

CFE  Statements 


Statement  by  the  Government  of  the 
Union  of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics 

In  order  to  promote  the  implementation  of  the  Treaty  on 
Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe  of  November  19, 
1990  (the  Treaty),  the  Government  of  the  Union  of  Soviet 
Socialist  Republics  states  that  it  assumes  the  following 
obligations  outside  the  framework  of  the  Treaty. 

I 

The  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics  shall  hold  within 
the  area  of  application  of  the  Treaty  conventional  armaments 
and  equipment  in  the  Treaty-limited  categories  not  to  exceed: 
in  Coastal  Defence  forces  —  813  battle  tanks,  972  armoured 
combat  vehicles  and  846  pieces  of  artillery;  in  Naval  Infantry 
—  120  battle  tanks,  753  armoured  combat  vehicles  and  234 
pieces  of  artillery;  in  the  Strategic  Rocket  Forces  —  1,701 
armoured  combat  vehicles,  each  being  an  armoured  personnel 
carrier  as  that  term  is  defined  in  the  Treaty. 

II 

Forty  months  after  entry  into  force  of  the  Treaty  and 
thereafter,  within  the  levels  and  sublevels  that  ensue  from  the 
obligations  of  the  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics  under 
the  Treaty,  the  holdings  of  the  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist 
Republics  of  battle  tanks,  armoured  combat  vehicles  and 
pieces  of  artillery  shall  be  less  than  its  maximum  level  for 
holdings,  as  notified  in  accordance  with  Article  VII  of  the 
Treaty,  by  the  number  it  will  have  in  Coastal  Defence  forces 
and  Naval  Infantry  within  the  area  of  application  of  the 
Treaty.  For  example,  with  regard  to  battle  tanks,  unless  the 
maximum  levels  for  holdings  for  the  Union  of  Soviet 
Socialist  Republics  are  revised  in  accordance  with  Article  VII 
of  the  Treaty,  the  numbers  for  the  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist 
Republics  within  the  area  of  application  of  the  Treaty, 
including  battle  tanks  in  Coastal  Defence  forces  and  Naval 
Infantry,  will  not  exceed:  13,150  overall;  10,500  in  active 
units  overall;  7,150  in  active  units  within  the  region 
described  in  Article  IV,  paragraph  3  of  the  Treaty;  and  1,850 
in  active  units  within  the  area  described  in  Article  V, 
paragraph  1,  subparagraph  (A)  of  the  Treaty. 

III 

1.  The  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics  shall 
reduce,  in  addition  to  the  reduction  liability  established  for 
the  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics  under  the  Treaty  on 
the  basis  of  information  it  supplied,  its  holding  of 
conventional  armaments  and  equipment  in  the  Treaty- 
limited  categories  within  the  area  of  application  of  the 
Treaty  by  the  number  which  it  had  as  of  the  date  of 
signature  of  the  Treaty  in  Coastal  Defense  forces  and  Naval 
Infantry,  that  is,  by  933  battle  tanks,  1,725  armoured 
combat  vehicles,  and  1,080  pieces  of  artillery. 


2.  Such  additional  reduction  shall  be  carried  out  by 
means  of  destruction  or  conversion  into  civilian  equipment 
of  933  battle  tanks  and  destruction  of  1,080  pieces  of 
artillery.  Of  the  1,725  armoured  combat  vehicles  to  be 
additionally  reduced,  972  armoured  combat  vehicles  shall  be 
destroyed  or  converted  into  civilian  equipment  and  753 
armoured  combat  vehicles  of  the  MT-LB  type,  included  in 
the  armoured  combat  vehicle  category  and  belonging  to  the 
number  declared  as  of  the  date  of  signature  of  the  Treaty, 
shall  be  modified,  in  accordance  with  the  Protocol  on 
Existing  Types,  into  armoured  personnel  carrier  look-alikes 
of  the  MT-LB- AT  type,  which  are  not  limited  by  the  Treaty. 

3.  Fifty  percent  of  the  933  battle  tanks  and  972 
armoured  combat  vehicles  shall  be  destroyed  or  converted 
within  the  area  of  application  of  the  Treaty  and  50  percent 
of  the  1,080  pieces  of  artillery  shall  be  destroyed  within  the 
area  of  application  of  the  Treaty,  within  the  time  limits  and 
in  accordance  with  the  procedures  established  by  the  Treaty. 
The  remainder  of  these  conventional  armaments  and 
equipment  shall  be  withdrawn  from  the  area  of  application 
of  the  Treaty;  an  equivalent  number  of  conventional 
armaments  and  equipment  shall  be  destroyed  or  converted 
outside  of  the  area  of  application  of  the  Treaty  within  the 
time  limits  established  by  the  Treaty  and  in  accordance  with 
procedures  which  provide  sufficient  visible  evidence  that  the 
conventional  armaments  and  equipment  have  been  destroyed 
or  rendered  militarily  unusable.  The  States  Parties  to  the 
Treaty  shall  be  notified  in  advance,  giving  the  location, 
number  and  types  of  conventional  armaments  and 
equipment  to  be  destroyed  or  converted. 

IV 

The  holdings  of  armoured  combat  vehicles  in  the  Strategic 
Rocket  Forces  of  the  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics  shall 
not  be  subject  to  the  numerical  limitations  of  the  Treaty,  in 
accordance  with  Article  III,  paragraph  1,  subparagraph  (F)  of 
the  Treaty.  These  forces  shall  not  be  equipped  with 
conventional  armaments  and  equipment  in  the  Treaty-limited 
categories,  other  than  armoured  personnel  carriers. 

V 

The  conventional  armaments  and  equipment  of  Coastal 
Defence  forces  and  Naval  Infantry  in  the  categories  subject 
to  the  Treaty  within  the  area  of  application  of  the  Treaty 
shall  be  subject  to  challenge  inspections  in  accordance  with 
the  provisions  of  the  Protocol  on  Inspection.  Effective 
verification  of  such  armaments  and  equipment  shall  be 
ensured.  The  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics  shall 
provide  separate  information  to  all  States  Parties  on  such 
armaments  and  equipment  of  the  same  scope  and  with  the 
same  degree  of  detail  as  provided  for  in  Section  III, 
paragraph  2  of  the  Protocol  on  Information  Exchange,  and 
under  the  same  timetable  for  the  provision  of  information  as 
provided  for  in  Section  VII  of  that  Protocol.

June  14,  1991. 

Statement  of  the  Representative  of  the  Union  of  Soviet 
Socialist  Republics  in  the  Joint  Consultative  Group 

In  order  to  promote  the  implementation  of  the  Treaty  on 
Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe  of  November  19, 
1990,  (the  Treaty)  I  have  been  instructed  by  the  Government 
of  the  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics  to  state  the 
following: 

1.  The  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics  will,  during 
1991-1995,  destroy  or  convert  into  civilian  equipment  no 
less  than  6,000  battle  tanks,  1,500  armoured  combat 
vehicles  and  7,000  pieces  of  artillery  from  among  the 
conventional  armaments  and  equipment  in  the  Treaty- 
limited  categories  beyond  the  Urals,  in  addition  to  the 
numbers  of  armaments  subject  to  destruction  and  conversion 
specified  in  the  Statement  of  the  Government  of  the  Union  of 
Soviet  Socialist  Republics  of  June  14,  1991  concerning 
obligations  outside  the  framework  of  the  Treaty. 

The  armaments  will  be  destroyed  or  converted  under  the 
procedures  that  will  provide  sufficient  visible  evidence, 
which  confirms  that  they  have  been  destroyed  or  rendered 
militarily  unusable.  Advance  notification  and  information 
will  be  provided  to  the  States  Parties  to  the  Treaty  regarding 


the  locations  and  numbers  of  battle  tanks,  armoured  combat 
vehicles  and  pieces  of  artillery  undergoing  destruction  or 
conversion. 

Elimination  of  armaments  in  the  Treaty-limited  categories 
will  also  be  carried  out  subsequently  as  their  operational  and 
service  life  is  expended. 

2.  The  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics,  in  the 
period  between  January  1989  and  signature  of  the  Treaty  on 
November  19,  1990,  in  connection  with  activities  related  to 
unilateral  reductions  of  the  Soviet  armed  forces,  the 
withdrawal  of  Soviet  troops  from  countries  of  Eastern 
Europe  and  adaption  of  the  armed  forces  to  the  new 
defensive  doctrine,  withdrew  beyond  the  Urals  the  following 
numbers  of  conventional  armaments  and  equipment  in  the 
Treaty-limited  categories:  16,400  battle  tanks,  15,900 
armoured  combat  vehicles  and  25,000  pieces  of  artillery. 

Of  these  numbers  of  armaments  and  equipment,  8,000 
battle  tanks,  11,200  armoured  combat  vehicles  and  1,600 
pieces  of  artillery  have  been  turned  over  to  military  units  and 
subunits  in  the  eastern  Soviet  Union  for  the  purpose  of 
reequipping  them  and  supplementing  their  armaments. 

Another  part  of  the  conventional  armaments  and 
equipment  in  the  Treaty-limited  categories  which  have  been 
transferred  beyond  the  Urals  (8,400  battle  tanks,  4,700 
armoured  combat  vehicles  and  16,400  pieces  of  artillery), 
has  been  placed  in  storage.  In  addition,  7,000  pieces  of 
artillery  are  being  used  for  replacement  and  repair. 

These  stored  conventional  armaments  and  equipment 
withdrawn  beyond  the  Urals  will  be  used  up  in  the  process 
of  replacing  obsolete  armaments  and  equipment  that  have 
expended  their  established  operational  and  service  life  and, 
in  the  eastern  Soviet  Union,  also  in  supplementing  units. 

With  respect  to  the  armaments  and  equipment  transferred 
beyond  the  Urals  before  signature  of  the  Treaty  that  have 
been  placed  in  storage  or  are  used  for  replacement  and 
repair  beyond  the  Urals,  upon  entry  into  force  of  the  Treaty, 
information  will  be  provided  to  all  States  Parties  about  the 
location  and  numbers  of  battle  tanks,  armoured  combat 
vehicles  and  pieces  of  artillery  at  such  locations  as  of  July  1, 
1991.  Armaments  in  each  of  these  categories  (battle  tanks, 
armoured  combat  vehicles  and  pieces  of  artillery)  will  be 
stored  separately. 

3.  The  conventional  armaments  and  equipment  in  the 
Treaty-limited  categories  withdrawn  beyond  the  Urals  prior 
to  signature  of  the  Treaty  will  not  be  used  to  create  a 
strategic  reserve  or  operational  groupings,  and  will  not  be 
stored  in  any  way  permitting  their  rapid  return  to  the  area  of 
application  of  the  Treaty,  that  is,  such  armaments  and 
equipment  withdrawn  beyond  the  Urals  will  not  be  stored  in 
sets  for  military  formations. 

Military  formations  and  units  deployed  within  the 
area  of  application  of  the  Treaty  will  be  organized  in  line 
with  the  Soviet  defensive  doctrine  and  taking  into  account 
the  sufficiency  levels  of  armaments  established  by  the  Treaty 
for  a  single  state.

organisations  will  provide  all  relevant  information 
supporting  such  exclusion.  ^ 

SECTION  VI.  VERIFICATION/EVALUATION 

1.  For  the  purpose  of  evaluating  observance  of  national 
personnel  limits  and  the  other  provisions  of  this  Act, 
Participating  States  will  apply  Section  VII  and  Section  VIII  of 
the  Protocol  on  Inspection  of  the  CFE  Treaty  and  other 
relevant  provisions  of  that  Treaty,  together  with  the 
provisions  set  out  in  this  section.

other  organisation  which  was  notified  in  the  most  recent 
exchange  of  information  in  accordance  with  Section  IV  of 
this  Act  and  which  is  located  at  that  inspection  site.  If  the 
number  of  such  personnel  differs  from  the  number  of 
personnel  noted  in  that  most  recent  exchange  of 
information,  the  inspection  team  will  be  provided  with  an 
explanation  of  such  difference.  The  preinspection  briefing 
will  also  include  information  on  the  number  of  personnel 
serving  with  any  other  formation  or  unit  down  to  the 
brigade/regiment,  wing/air  regiment  or  equivalent  level,  as 
well  as  independent  units  at  the  battalion/squadron  or 
equivalent  level,  in  the  categories  specified  in  Paragraph  1,

which  is  located  at  that  inspection  site. 

3.  In  the  case  of  an  inspection  pursuant  to  Section  VIII 
of  the  Protocol  on  Inspection  of  the  CFE  Treaty,  the  escort 
team  will  provide,  if  requested  by  the  inspection  team, 
information  on  the  number  of  personnel  serving  with  any 
formation,  unit  or  other  organisation  which  was  notified  in 
the  most  recent  exchange  of  information  in  accordance  with

such  personnel  differs  from  the  number  of  personnel  notified 
in  that  most  recent  exchange  of  information,  the  inspection 
team  will  be  provided  with  an  explanation  of  such 
difference. 

4.  During  an  inspection  pursuant  to  Section  VII  or 
Section  VIII  of  the  Protocol  on  Inspection  of  the  CFE  Treaty, 
inspectors  may  have  access,  consistent  with  the  provisions  of 
that  Protocol,  to  all  facilities  subject  to  inspection  at  the 
inspection  site,  including  those  used  by  all  formations,  units 
and  other  organisations  located  at  that  inspection  site. 
During  such  an  inspection,  the  escort  team  will  specify,  if

5.  Inspectors  will  include  in  the  inspection  report 
prepared  pursuant  to  Section  XII  of  the  Protocol  on 
Inspection  of  the  CFE  Treaty  information  provided  to  the 
inspection  team  in  accordance  with  Paragraphs  2  and  3  of 
this  section  in  a  format  to  be  agreed  in  the  Joint  Consultative 
Group.  Inspectors  may  also  include  in  that  report  written 
comments  pertaining  to  the  evaluation  of  personnel 
strengths. 

6.  Evaluation  of  observance  of  the  provisions  of  this  Act 
will  be  further  facilitated  through  confidence  and  security 
building  measures  that  have  hfen  developed  and  that  may  be 
developed  in  the  context  of  the  new  negotiations  on 
disarmament  and  confidence  and  security  building  following 
the  Helsinki  follow-up  meeting.  In  this  context,  Participating 
States  are  prepared  to  join  in  considering  ways  and  means  to

Recalling  the  results  of  the  Extraordinary  Conferences  held

Reaffirming  all  the  decisions  of  the  Joint  Consultative  Group

Having  met  at  the  First  Review  Conference,  chaired  by  the 
Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands,  from  15  to  31  May  1996  in 
Vienna, 


Have  adopted  the  following: 

I.  INTRODUCTION 

1.  The  States  Parties  reaffirm  the  fundamental  role  of 
the  Treaty  as  a  cornerstone  of  European  security  and  their 
adherence  to  its  goals  and  objectives.  It  is  their  common 
interest  to  preserve  the  integrity  of  the  Treaty  and  the 
Concluding  Act  as  well  as  the  predictability  and 
transparency  they  have  created.  The  States  Parties  reaffirm 
their  determination  to  fulfill  in  good  faith  all  obligations  and 
commitments  arising  from  the  Treaty  and  its  associated 
documents.  Bearing  that  in  mind,  they  commit  themselves  to 
enhance  the  viability  and  effectiveness  of  the  Treaty. 

2.  The  negotiation,  conclusion  and  implementation  of 
the  Treaty  and  the  Concluding  Act,  as  well  as  the  ratification 
of  the  Treaty,  took  place  in  times  of  change  during  which  the 
European  security  environment  evolved  significantly.  The 
Warsaw  Treaty  Organization  has  ceased  to  exist.  New  states 
have  emerged  and  became  States  Parties  to  the  Treaty.  At  the 
same  time,  new  risks  and  challenges  to  security  have  come  to 
the  fore.  As  a  result  of  common  efforts  of  the  States  Parties, 
the  Treaty  and  the  Concluding  Act  have  remained  vital 
stabilizing  factors  in  this  period  of  transition  and 
contributed  to  its  peaceful  unfolding. 

3.  The  States  Parties  stress  that  security  and  stability  in 
Europe  are  vitally  underpinned  by  the  continuation  and 
enhancement  of  robust  arms  control  measures.  Recognizing 
the  evolution  of  the  European  political  and  security 
environment,  the  States  Parties  are  resolved  to  continue  the 
conventional  arms  control  process,  including  through  the 
enhancement  of  the  viability  and  effectiveness  of  the  Treaty. 
They  see  this  as  a  common  responsibility. 

4.  The  States  Parties  recognize  that  the  Treaty  and  the 
Concluding  Act  are  essential  contributions  to  the 
achievement  of  the  goals  and  purposes  of  the  Organization 
for  Security  and  Co-operation  in  Europe  (OSCE),  in 
particular  the  promotion  of  confidence,  stability  and  security 
in  an  undivided  Europe.  In  that  context,  they  stress  the 


332 


On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


importance  of  the  development  of  a  common  and 
comprehensive  security  model  for  Europe  for  the  twenty-first 
century,  of  the  implementation  of  the  Treaty  on  Open  Skies 
and  of  the  ongoing  security  dialogue  and  negotiations  in  the 
Forum  for  Security  Co-operation. 

II.  REVIEW  OF  THE  OPERATION  OF  THE  TREATY 
AND  THE  CONCLUDING  ACT 

5.  The  States  Parties  note  with  satisfaction  that  more 
than  58,000  pieces  of  conventional  armaments  and 
equipment  have  been  reduced,  and  that  the  overall  holdings 
of  conventional  armaments  and  equipment  within  the  area 
of  application  are  substantially  lower  than  the  limits  set  in 
the  Treaty. 

More  than  2,500  inspections  have  taken  place.  A 
permanent  system  for  regular  and  routine  exchange  of 
Treaty  notifications  and  other  information  has  been 
developed.  The  Joint  Consultative  Group  has  been  firmly 
established  and  has  demonstrated  its  utility  and  importance 
as  the  ongoing  Treaty  forum. 

With  regard  to  the  Concluding  Act,  the  States  Parties 
note  with  satisfaction  that  the  personnel  strength  of 
conventional  armed  forces  in  the  area  of  application  was 
reduced  by  1.2  million  persons. 

6.  The  States  Parties  note  that  the  Treaty  established  a 
high  degree  of  transparency  in  military  relations  through  its 
comprehensive  system  for  exchange  of  information  and  for 
verification.  Together  with  the  extensive  reductions  of 
conventional  armaments  and  equipment,  this  has  led  to 
greater  predictability  and  confidence  in  security  relations. 

The  Treaty  has  also  nurtured  the  development  of  new 
patterns  of  co-operation  in  Europe  and  provides  a  basis  for 
stability  and  enhanced  security  in  Europe  at  substantially 
lower  levels  of  conventional  armaments  and  equipment  than 
heretofore.  Although  risks  and  challenges  still  exist  in  some 
parts  of  Europe,  the  capability  for  launching  surprise  attack 
and  the  danger  of  large-scale  offensive  action  in  Europe  as  a 
whole  have  been  diminished  substantially.  Nevertheless,  the 
achievement  of  the  goals  of  the  Treaty  in  the  whole  area  of 
its  application  requires  continuous  efforts  by  the  States 
Parties. 

7.  The  States  Parties  reaffirm  the  continued  relevance  of 
the  basic  structures  of  the  Treaty  including  the  principle  of 
zonal  limitations,  as  embodied  in  Articles  IV  and  V  of  the 
Treaty.  In  this  respect,  and  in  line  with  the  decision  of  the 
Joint  Consultative  Group  of  17  November  1995,  the  States 
Parties  have  agreed  on  a  document,  which  is  contained  in 
Annex  A,  reflecting  a  combination  of  measures  agreed  in 
cooperative  fashion  and  acceptable  to  all  parties  to  the 
Treaty. 

8.  States  Parties  regret  that  not  all  reduction  obligations 
pursuant  to  the  Treaty  have  been  met.  They  stress  the 
necessity  to  complete  as  soon  as  possible  reductions  of 
conventional  armaments  and  equipment  limited  by  the 
Treaty  (TLE)  in  accordance  with  obligations  under  the 
Treaty.  They  note  with  satisfaction  the  reiterated 
commitment  of  those  States  Parties  which  still  have  to 
complete  reductions  to  comply  with  the  provisions  of  the 
Treaty  and  associated  documents.  All  States  Parties  express 


their  readiness  to  follow  this  process  to  its  completion  in 
accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Treaty.  In  this  context, 
being  aware  of  difficulties  which  have  delayed  the 
completion  of  reductions,  they  take  positive  note  of  efforts 
undertaken  in  order  to  meet  fully  obligations  under  the 
Treaty. 

9.  States  Parties  express  their  concern  with  serious 
difficulties  of  some  States  Parties  to  comply  fully  within  their 
territory  with  the  provisions  of  the  Treaty  and  its  related 
documents  due  to  TLE  unaccounted  for  and  uncontrolled 
within  the  Treaty.  This  situation  adversely  affects  the 
operation  of  the  Treaty  and  complicates  its  implementation. 

They  stress  the  need  to  reach  as  soon  as  possible  relevant 
political  solutions  and  to  elaborate  necessary  measures  to 
enable  the  implementation  of  the  Treaty  in  accordance  with 
its  provisions. 

They  express  their  readiness  to  address  the  issue  of  this 
TLE  in  the  Joint  Consultative  Group,  including  the  ways  and 
means  to  facilitate  the  resolution  of  this  issue. 

10.  The  States  Parties  have  adopted  the  understandings 
and  agreed  interpretations  with  regard  to  implementation 
and  ways  and  means  to  improve  the  viability  and 
effectiveness  of  the  Treaty  as  specified  in  Annex  B  of  this 
Final  Document. 

11.  The  States  Parties  have  agreed  that  the 
implementation  issues  contained  in  Annex  C  of  this  Final 
Document  require  further  consideration  and  resolution  in 
the  Joint  Consultative  Group. 

12.  The  States  Parties  reaffirm  the  arrangements  of 
Article  XII  reached  at  the  Extraordinary  Conferences  in  Oslo 
in  1992. 

They  understand  that  for  successor  states  that  had 
become  States  Parties  by  1992,  paragraph  2  of  the  Article 
XII  part  of  the  Oslo  arrangement  should  be  read  as:  “In 
particular,  no  State  Party  will  increase  within  the  area  of 
application  its  holdings  of  armoured  infantry  fighting 
vehicles  held  by  organizations  designed  and  structured  to 
perform  in  peacetime  internal  security  functions  above  that 
aggregate  number  held  by  such  organizations  at  the  time  of 
signature  of  the  Treaty,  as  notified  on  their  territory 
pursuant  to  the  information  exchange  as  of  November  19, 
1990.” 

They  agree  to  work  further  on  this  issue  of  Article  XII  in 
the  Joint  Consultative  Group,  taking  into  account  the 
proposals  made  at  the  Review  Conference. 

13.  States  Parties  stressed  the  importance  of  full  and 
continuous  respect  for  the  provisions  of  Article  IV, 
paragraph  5,  in  the  context  of  maintaining  the  viability  of 
the  Treaty,  as  well  as  for  the  sovereignty  of  the  States  Parties 
involved. 

States  Parties  noted  that,  in  certain  instances,  bilateral 
agreements  are  under  negotiation — or  in  the  process  of 
ratification  or  implementation  — which  relate  to  the 
provisions  of  Article  IV,  paragraph  5.  States  Parties — 
expressed  their  support  for  early  and  positive  results  of  the 
ongoing  processes. 


333 


Appendix  D:  Final  Document  oe  the  First  CFE  Review  Conference 


States  Parties  consider  that  the  importance  of  the  Article 
IV  provisions  on  stationing  forces  should  be  recognised  in 
the  context  of  the  process  foreseen  in  Section  III  of  this  Final 
Document. 

14.  In  the  context  of  the  process  foreseen  in  Section  III  of 
this  Final  Document,  States  Parties  will  examine  different 
interpretations  of  temporary  deployments  so  as  to  ensure 
that  these  temporary  deployments  do  not  become  indefinite. 

15.  The  States  Parties  recall  that  according  to  Article  II, 
paragraph  2  of  the  Treaty,  the  lists  of  existing  types 
contained  in  Protocol  on  Existing  Types  of  Conventional 
Armaments  and  Equipment  (POET)  shall  be  updated 
periodically  by  the  Joint  Consultative  Group  in  accordance 
with  Section  IV  of  the  POET.  However,  it  has  not  been 
updated  since  the  Treaty’s  conclusion. 

The  States  Parties  instruct  their  delegations  to  the  Joint 
Consultative  Group  to  update  the  POET.  They  further 
agreed  that: 

•  any  inaccuracies  should  be  corrected;  including  by 
removal  of  types,  models  and  versions  of 
conventional  armaments  and  equipment  that  do  not 
meet  Treaty  criteria; 

•  the  Joint  Consultative  Group  should  consider  if  a 
yearly  update  of  the  lists  would  be  appropriate; 

•  the  Joint  Consultative  Group  should  consider  an 
electronic  version  of  the  lists  in  all  official  languages. 

16.  The  States  Parties  also  discussed  the  topics  contained 
in  Annex  D  of  this  Final  Document. 

17.  The  States  Parties  welcome  the  statement  of  the 
representative  of  the  Russian  Federation  to  promote  the 
implementation  of  the  statement  of  the  representative  of  the 
Union  of  Soviet  Socialists  Republics  in  the  Joint  Consultative 
Group  on  14  June  1991  in  Vienna.  The  text  of  the  Russian 
statement  is  laid  down  in  Annex  E  of  this  Final  Document. 

18.  The  States  Parties  recommend  that  in  view  of  the 
issues  that  have  been  referred  to  the  Joint  Consultative 
Group,  most  effective  use  is  made  of  the  provisions  of 
Article  XVI  and  the  Protocol  on  the  Joint  Consultative 
Group,  in  order  to  allow  the  Joint  Consultative  Group  to 
address  all  those  issues  in  a  proper  manner. 

m.  FUTURE  WORK  ON  THE  TREATY 

19.  In  view  of  Sections  I  and  II  of  this  Final  Document, 
the  States  Parties  instruct  their  delegations  to  the  Joint 
Consultative  Group  to  expand  upon  their  work  in 
accordance  with  Article  XVI  of  the  Treaty.  Taking  fresh 
impetus  from  this  Review  Conference,  they  will  immediately 
start  a  thorough  process  aimed  at  improving  the  operation 
of  the  Treaty  in  a  changing  environment  and,  through  that, 
the  security  of  each  State  Party,  irrespective  of  whether  it 
belongs  to  a  politico-military  alliance.  As  part  of  this 
process,  the  States  Parties  will  consider  measures  and 
adaptations  with  the  aim  of  promoting  the  objectives  of  the 
Treaty  and  of  enhancing  its  viability  and  effectiveness, 
including  but  not  limited  to  the  consideration  of  proposals 
already  made  to  that  effect.  The  character  of  this  process 
should  be  such  as  to  permit  the  Treaty  to  sustain  its  key  role 


in  the  European  security  architecture.  Its  scope  and 
parameters  should  be  defined  as  a  matter  of  priority. 

20.  Until  the  entry  into  force  of  such  measures  and 
adaptations,  the  States  Parties  will  observe  all  provisions  of 
the  Treaty  and  its  associated  documents. 

21.  The  States  Parties  will  consider  a  progress  report  on 
the  intermediate  results  of  this  process  at  the  time  of  the 
OSCE  Lisbon  Summit.  This  report  will  inter  alia  include 
recommendations  on  the  way  ahead. 

In  accordance  with  Article  XXI,  paragraph  1,  the  States 
Parties  look  forward  to  gathering  again  in  five  years  time  to 
conduct  the  second  review  of  the  operation  of  the  Treaty  on 
Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe. 

This  Final  Document,  together  with  its  Annexes  A,  B,  C, 
D,  and  E,  which  are  integral  to  it,  having  been  drawn  up  in 
all  the  official  languages  of  the  Organization  for  Security 
and  Co-operation  in  Europe,  shall  be  deposited  with  the 
government  of  the  Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands  as  the 
designated  depositary  for  the  Treaty,  which  shall  circulate 
copies  of  this  Final  Document  to  all  the  States  Parties.

exercising  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the  inspected 
State  Party  delays  an  inspection  on  grounds  of  force 
majeure,  it  shall,  in  written  form,  explain  the  reasons 
for  this  delay  in  detail; 

This  should  take  place  as  follows: 

•  If  force  majeure  is  declared  prior  to  the  arrival  of  the 
inspection  team,  through  the  answer  to  the  relevant

should  be  presented  as  soon  as  possible,  through 
diplomatic  channels  or  other  official  channels.

transport  crew  members,  the  State  Party  shall  provide  the 
complete  updated  list  highlighting  the  additions.

declared  sites  within  a  specified  area  are  excluded  from  an 
inspection  of  the  specified  area  (inspections  in  accordance

be  inspected  only  in  accordance  with  Section  VII  of  the 
Protocol  on  Inspection. 

8.  States  Parties  agree  to  send  the  notification  of  the 
intent  to  inspect  simultaneously  to  the  host  and  the 
stationing  States  Parties,  if  the  inspecting  State  intends  to 
conduct  a  sequential  inspection  which  involves  stationed 
forces. 

9.  Where  appropriate  and  with  the  agreement  of  the 
State  Party  on  whose  territory  an  inspection  is  to  be  carried 
out  in  respect  of  conventional  armaments  and  equipment 
limited  by  the  Treaty  of  a  stationing  State  Party,  the

accordance  with  that  statement,  upon  the  application  of  any 
of  the  following  methods: 

(A)  Destruction  or  conversion  of  conventional 
armaments  and  equipment  under  procedures  that 
provide  sufficient  visible  evidence,  which  confirms 
that  they  have  been  destroyed  or  rendered  militarily 
unusable; 

(B)  Provision  of  satisfactory  documentary  evidence  as 
meeting  requirements  of  sufficient  visible  evidence, 
only  in  case  of  such  armaments  and  equipment 
destroyed  prior  to  the  promulgation  of  this 
statement.  The  Russian  Federation  intends  to 
provide  such  documentary  evidence  with  regard  to 
armaments  and  equipment  destroyed  in  the  area  of 
application  of  the  Treaty  after  17  November  1995; 

(C)  Segregation  of  battle  tanks  and  armoured  combat 
vehicles  exposed  to  the  influence  of  atmospheric 
factors,  with  hatches  and  covers  of  engine 
compartments  opened,  with  the  invitation  of  a  group 
of  experts  to  conduct — at  its  own  expense — an 
examination  of  a  random  sample  representative  of 
those  conventional  armaments  and  equipment,  prior 
to  their  removal  from  a  display  site  for  final  disposal 
(scrapping),  and  notification  of  such  removal; 

(D)  Visit  of  group  of  experts,  at  its  own  expense  and 
upon  invitation,  to  count  already  derelict 
conventional  armaments  and  equipment; 

(E)  Notification  preceding  or  accompanying  each 
transfer  of  conventional  armaments  and  equipment 
to  other  States  Parties  within  the  area  of  application 
of  the  Treaty,  with  equivalent  relevant  notification 
from  the  recipient  State  Party.  Such  transfers  will  be 
done  in  line  with  Treaty  provisions  and  will  be 
compatible  with  the  objectives  and  terms  of  the 
Statement  of  the  Soviet  Representative. 

2.  Continuing  its  efforts  aimed  at  the  implementation 
of  the  statement  of  the  Soviet  representative,  the  Russian 
Federation  will  apply  methods  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  of 
this  statement  to  conventional  armaments  and  equipment 
located  on  its  territory.  It  will  co-operate  with  the  Republic 
of  Kazakstan  and  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  in  applying 
those  methods  to  conventional  armaments  and  equipment 
located  on  their  territories.  The  Russian  Federation  will 
negotiate  the  necessary  arrangements  with  those  states  for

On-Site  Inspection  Agency 


the  purpose  of  completing  by  joint  efforts  the  process 
referred  to  in  paragraph  1  of  the  Statement  of  the  Soviet 
Representative  by  the  year  2000. 

3.  If,  despite  good  faith  efforts,  the  quota  of  6000 
battle  tanks  subject  to  elimination  is  not  fully  met,  the 
shortfall  of  not  more  than  2300  battle  tanks  will  be  covered 
by  applying  methods  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  of  this 
statement  to  an  equal  number  of  armoured  combat  vehicles 
in  excess  of  the  quota  of  1500  pieces;  and  thus  the  overall 
process  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  of  the  Statement  of  the 
Soviet  Representative  will  be  in  general  deemed  completed. 
Notwithstanding  that,  a  number  of  battle  tanks  equal  to  the 
above-mentioned  shortfall  will  be  subsequently  eliminated. 
The  envisaged  date  for  the  completion  of  the  process  of  their 
elimination  will  depend  on  the  duration  of  their  operational 
and  service  life  and  on  the  availability  of  financial  resources. 
That  elimination  will  be  carried  out  in  line  with  paragraph  1 
of  this  statement. 

4.  Upon  completion  of  initial  visits  referred  to  in 
paragraph  1  of  this  statement,  the  Russian  Federation  will  be 
ready  to  discuss  in  the  JCG  their  results  and  in  the  light  of 
these  to  make  arrangements,  as  necessary,  for  further  visits, 
as  well  as  to  discuss  possible  modalities  for  further  visits.  In 
general,  relevant  practices  established  in  the  process  of 
Treaty  implementation  will  be  followed  as  much  as 
applicable  in  the  organization  and  conduct  of  the  visits.

CONFERENCE  TO  REVIEW  THE  OPERATION  OF  THE 
TREATY  ON  CONVENTIONAL  ARMED  FORCES  IN 
EUROPE  AND  THE  CONCLUDING  ACT  OF  THE

financial  resources”  in  the  Statement  of  the 
Representative  of  the  Russian  Federation  as 
contained  in  Annex  E  of  the  Final  Document  of  the 
Review  Conference  of  the  Treaty  on  Conventional 
Armed  Forces  in  Europe,  it  is  understood  that  this

obligations. 

•  Temporary  deployment  and  reallocation  of  quotas 
referred  to  in  Section  IV,  paragraphs  2  and  3,  of  the 
Document  will  not  be  used  in  the  context  of  the 
Azerbaijan  Republic.

FEDERATION  AT  THE  CFE  REVIEW  CONFERENCE 

31  MAY  1996 

Unless  flexibilities  listed  in  the  agreement  on  the  flank  issue 
are  realized  by  31  May  1999  the  Russian  Federation  retains 
the  right  to  use  other  Treaty  flexibilities  discussed  but  not 
mentioned  in  the  above  agreement. 


STATEMENT  OF  UKRAINE  AT  THE  CONFERENCE  TO 
REVIEW  THE  OPERATION  OF  THE  TREATY  ON 
CONVENTIONAL  ARMED  FORCES  IN  EUROPE 

31  MAY  1996 

In  connection  with  the  decision  of  the  CFE  Review 
Conference  of  31  May  1996  to  adopt  the  “Document 
Agreed  by  the  States  Parties  to  the  Treaty  on  Conventional 
Armed  Forces  in  Europe  of  November  19,  1990,”  Ukraine 
gives  consent  to  such  a  decision,  with  the  understanding 
that,  in  implementing  its  provisions,  the  States  Parties  will 
proceed  from  the  following: 

1.  The  rights  and  obligations  of  the  Russian  Federation 
set  forth  in  Section  II,  paragraphs  1  and  3,  and  Section  V, 
paragraph  1,  of  the  Document,  in  relation  to  “the  area 
described  in  Article  V,  subparagraph  1(A),  of  the  Treaty,  as 
understood  by  the  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics  at  the 
time  the  Treaty  was  signed,”  do  not  cover  the  territory  of 
Ukraine,  namely  the  autonomous  Republic  of  the  Crimea, 
Nikolayev  Oblast,  Zaporozhskaya  Oblast  and  Kherson 
Oblast. 

2.  Section  II,  paragraphs  1  and  3,  and  Section  IV, 
paragraph  2,  of  the  Document,  do  not  cover  that  portion  of 
the  TLE  of  the  naval  infantry  and  coastal  defence  forces 
which,  as  a  result  of  the  Black  Sea  Fleet  division  between 
Ukraine  and  the  Russian  Federation,  will  be  assigned  to  the 
Russian  Federation  and  subject  to  their  withdrawal  from  the 
territory  of  Ukraine  with  the  agreed  timeframes. 

3.  The  provisions  of  Section  IV,  paragraph  2,  of  the 
Document,  shall  in  no  way  restrict  the  right  and  possibilities 
of  Ukraine  to  deploy  on  a  temporary  basis,  under  Article  V, 
paragraph  1,  of  the  Treaty,  combat  tanks,  armoured  combat 
vehicles  and  artillery  within  the  “new”  flank  area. 

4.  The  provisions  of  Section  IV,  paragraph  3,  of  the 
Document,  shall  in  no  way  bear  upon  the  rights  and 
obligations  of  Ukraine  under  the  Agreement  on  the 
Principles  and  Procedures  for  the  Implementation  of  the 
Treaty  on  Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe  of  15  May 
1992. 

The  delegation  of  Ukraine  requests  to  distribute  this 
Statement  as  an  Annex  to  the  Final  Document  of  the 
Conference. 

STATEMENT  OF  THE  DELEGATION  OF  MOLDOVA 
TO  THE  REVIEW  CONFERENCE  OF  THE  CFE  TREATY 
ON  31  MAY  1996 

In  relation  to  paragraph  7  Section  2  of  the  Final  Document, 
the  Republic  of  Moldova  would  like  to  make  the  following 
statement: 

The  early  entry  into  force  of  the  bilateral  agreement  on 
the  withdrawal  of  Russian  troops,  signed  between  the 
Republic  of  Moldova  and  the  Russian  Federation  on  21 
October  1994  shall  contribute  to  full  implementation  of  the 
Document  Agreed  Among  the  States  Parties  to  the  Treaty  on 
Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe. 

In  relation  to  Section  IV,  paragraph  2  of  the  Document 
Agreed  Among  the  States  Parties  to  the  Treaty  on 


339 


Appendix  D:  Final  Document  of  the  First  CFE  Review  Conference 


Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe  contained  in  the 
Annex  A  of  the  Final  Document,  the  Republic  of  Moldova 
would  like  to  make  the  following  interpretative  statement: 

The  constitution  of  the  Republic  of  Moldova  has 
proclaimed  the  permanent  neutrality  of  the  country, 
prohibiting  the  stationing  of  foreign  troops  on  the  territory 
of  the  Republic.  In  view  of  these  constitutional  provisions, 
the  Republic  of  Moldova  cannot  allow  even  temporary 
deployment  of  conventional  armaments  belonging  to  other 
countries  on  its  territory. 

I  would  like  to  ask  you  Mr.  Chairman  to  annex  this 
statement  to  the  Final  Document  with  the  translation  into  all 
official  languages. 

THE  STATEMENT  OF  THE  TURKISH  DELEGATION 
ON  THE  “DOCUMENT  AGREED  AMONG  THE 
STATES  PARTIES  TO  THE  CFE  TREATY  OF 
NOVEMBER  19,  1990.” 

On  the  occasion  of  the  adoption  of  the  Final  Document  of 
the  First  Review  Conference,  the  Turkish  delegation  registers 
the  following  understanding: 

1.  The  Document  in  question  does  not  change  in  any 
way  the  legally  binding  character  of  the  CFE  Treaty  and  its 
associated  documents,  nor  the  obligations  of  individual 
States  Parties  to  the  Treaty. 

2.  Paragraphs  2  and  3  of  Section  IV  of  the  Document 
cannot  be  interpreted  in  a  manner  which  may  prejudice  the 
provision  contained  in  Article  IV,  paragraph  5  of  the  CFE 
Treaty,  nor  the  principle  of  free  consent  enshrined  in  the 
OSCE  documents  in  the  use  of  such  rights. 

3.  The  “flexibilities”  contained  in  the  Treaty  consist  of 
those  mentioned  in  the  above  paragraphs  and  can  only  be 
used  in  full  respect  of  the  relevant  Treaty  provisions  and  on 
the  basis  of  agreements  concluded  and  implemented  with 
free  consent  of  the  States  Parties  involved. 

4.  While  the  Turkish  delegation  accepts  an  examination 
of  the  DPSS  provisions,  it  makes  it  clear  that  it  can  accept 
eventual  modifications  only  if  they  do  not  result  in  force 
concentrations  prejudicial  to  regional  balances  and  provided 


that  a  similar  examination  is  carried  out  for  the  clarification 
of  the  question  of  “temporary  deployments,”  in  particular 
with  regard  to  their  duration. 

5.  In  view  of  the  continued  relevance  of  the  regional 
sublimits  even  under  changing  conditions,  the  Turkish 
government  will  not  enter  into  any  negotiation  prejudicial  to 
the  principle  of  regional  sub-limits,  nor  accept  any  force 
limits  which  would  not  take  due  consideration  of  the  size  of 
its  territory,  population  and  the  security  environment  in 
adjacent  regions  not  subject  to  Treaty  limitations. 

I  request  that  this  statement  be  attached  to  the  Final 
Document. 

STATEMENT  OF  THE  DELEGATION  OF  GEORGIA 

The  Georgian  delegation  has  considered  paragraphs  2  and  3 
of  Section  IV  of  the  Document  Amongst  the  States  Parties  on 
the  flank  issue  very  carefully.  We  still  have  some  very  serious 
concerns  about  the  future  implementation  of  their  content. 

In  this  context  we  would  like  to  make  the  following 
statement: 

Any  agreement  on  temporary  deployment  of  conventional 
armed  forces  on  the  territory  of  Georgia  or  for  the 
reallocation  of  equipment  quotas  established  by  the 
Tashkent  Agreement  must  be  the  result  of  free  negotiation 
and  must  be  taken  with  full  respect  for  the  sovereignty  of 
Georgia  and  for  its  constitution.  All  parties  must  implement 
all  the  provisions  of  any  such  agreements  in  good  faith  and 
in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Treaty. 

STATEMENT  BY  THE  NETHERLANDS 

THE  NETHERLANDS 

31  MAY  1996 

It  is  the  view  of  the  16  members  of  the  Atlantic  Alliance  that 
any  future  flexibility  must  be  consistent  with  the  legal 
framework  of  the  Treaty,  as  agreed  by  all  30  States  Parties. 

I  request  that  this  statement  will  be  attached  to  the  Final 
Document.

Chronology:  CFE  Treaty 
Negotiations  and 
Implementaho ns  1 9 7 2-1 99 6 


1972  May  24.  President  Richard  M.  Nixon  and  General 
Secretary  Leonid  Brezhnev  reached  a  compromise 
agreement  to  hold  separate  political  and  military 
negotiations.  The  Conference  on  Security  and 
Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE)  would  deal  with 
political  issues,  and  Mutual  Balanced  Force  Reduc¬ 
tions  (MBFR)  in  Europe  with  actual  force  reduc¬ 
tions.  Detente  in  Europe  began. 

November  22.  The  CSCE  process  formally  began  in 
Helsinki,  Finland.  These  preliminary  negotiations 
of  the  35  CSCE  member  nations  involved  setting  up 
a  framework  to  negotiate  confidence  and  security 
building  measures. 

1973  July  3.  CSCE  negotiations  began  after  six  months 
of  preparatory  meetings.  The  35  nations  of  the 
CSCE  met  to  begin  the  process  of  negotiating 
confidence  and  security  building  measures  in 
Europe. 

October  30.  Negotiations  on  MBFR  began.  The 
object  of  negotiations  was  to  reduce  conventional 
forces  in  the  zone  of  Central  Europe  surrounding 
East  and  West  Germany  and  to  provide  a  stable 
military  balance  in  Central  Europe. 

1975  August  1.  The  CSCE  resulted  in  35  nations  signing 
the  concluding  document.  The  Helsinki  Final  Act 
was  primarily  designed  to  build  confidence  within 
Europe.  Confidence-building  measures  included 
notification  of  major  military  maneuvers  involving 
more  than  25,000  troops. 

1977  October  4.  A  first  CSCE  review  conference  on 
implementation  of  the  Helsinki  Final  Act  began  in 
Belgrade,  Yugoslavia. 

1978  March  9.  The  Belgrade  CSCE  review  conference 
closed,  with  no  conclusions  reached. 

May  25.  French  President  Valery  Giscard  d’Estaing 
proposed  a  two-stage  security  conference  during  a 
UN  meeting. 


1979  December.  Negotiations  for  MBFR  stalled  because 
of  the  NATO  decision  to  deploy  new  intermediate- 
range  nuclear  weapons  in  Europe. 

December.  The  Soviet  Union  invaded  Afghanistan. 

1980  November  1 1.  The  second  CSCE  review  conference 
began  in  Madrid,  Spain.  These  negotiations  would 
continue  for  almost  three  years,  leading  to  the 
adoption  of  the  Madrid  Mandate. 

1983  September  6-9.  The  Madrid  CSCE  conference 
ended  after  almost  three  years  of  negotiations.  The 
35  CSCE  states  signed  the  Madrid  Concluding 
Document,  or  Madrid  Mandate,  which  established 
the  Stockholm  Conference  on  Confidence  and 
Security  Building  Measures.  The  mandate  called 
for  member  nations  to  negotiate  treaties  reducing 
the  size  of  their  armed  forces  in  Europe,  in  addition 
to  continuing  work  to  develop  confidence  and 
security  building  measures. 

1984  January  17.  The  CSCE  Stockholm  Conference  on 
Confidence  and  Security  Building  Measures  and 
Disarmament  in  Europe  (CDE)  began. 

1985  March  10.  Mikhail  Gorbachev  became  General 
Secretary  of  the  Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet 
Union. 

March  13.  President  Ronald  Reagan  reversed  his 
position  on  holding  high-level  talks  with  leaders  of 
the  Soviet  Union. 

November  19-20.  President  Reagan  and  General 
Secretary  Gorbachev  held  their  first  summit 
meeting. 

1986  April  18.  General  Secretary  Gorbachev  proposed  in 
MBFR  negotiations  to  reduce  ground  and  air  forces, 
and  to  include  conventional  and  nuclear  weapons 
from  the  Atlantic  to  the  Urals.  Gorbachev  recog¬ 
nized  the  presence  of  significant  asymmetries  of 
conventional  forces  and  proposed  large-scale  force 
reductions  to  be  verified  by  on-site  inspection.

June  11.  Gorbachev’s  proposals  were  formalized 
during  a  Warsaw  Treaty  Organization  (WTO) 
meeting  in  Budapest,  with  the  proposals  later 
known  as  the  Budapest  Appeal  or  Budapest 
Communique. 

September  22.  In  Stockholm,  35  CSCE  nations, 
meeting  as  the  Conference  on  Confidence  and 
Security  Building  and  Disarmament  in  Europe, 
adopted  an  accord,  the  Stockholm  Document, 
designed  to  increase  transparency  of  military  activi¬ 
ties  and  to  reduce  the  risk  of  war  in  Europe.  The 
agreement  required  notification  of  military  exercises 
of  13,000  troops  or  more,  and  allowed  on-site

the  CSBM  results  of  the  Stockholm  Conference  and 
the  other  to  establish  conventional  stability  in 
Europe  through  negotiations  on  conventional  arms 
control  from  the  Atlantic  to  the  Urals  (ATTU). 

1987  January  7.  The  Stockholm  Document  entered  into

December  7.  General  Secretary  Gorbachev  an¬ 
nounced  at  the  United  Nations  a  unilateral  with¬

ended  after  more  than  two  years,  resulting  in  the 
Vienna  Concluding  Document,  which  set  a  mandate 
for  CSBM  talks,  specifying  that  the  talks  would 
work  toward  “elaborating  and  adopting  a  new  set 
of  mutually  complementary  confidence  and  security 
building  measures  designed  to  reduce  the  risk  of

Europe,  among  other  measures  to  draw  down  from 
the  confrontational  attitudes  of  the  Cold  War. 

July  16.  West  German  Chancellor  Helmut  Kohl

October  1.  With  German  unification  drawing  near, 
the  Soviet  Union  had  17  divisions  stationed  in  East 
Germany,  totaling  more  than  363,700  troops,

October-November.  U.S.  Secretary  of  State  Baker 
and  Soviet  Foreign  Minister  Shevardnadze  resolved 
most  major  outstanding  CFE  issues.  CFE  negotia¬ 
tors  in  Vienna  resolved  most  of  the  remaining 
smaller,  technical  disputes.  Major  disagreements 
over  verification  were  resolved,  and  the  “sufficiency 
rule”  was  established. 

October  13.  Soviet  Foreign  Minister  Shevardnadze

Democratic  Republic  ceased  to  exist.)  The  Vienna 
Document  1990  expanded  on  the  CSBM  provisions 
of  the  1986  Stockholm  Document. 

November  18.  The  Soviet  Union  submitted  official 
treaty  data.  Data  submitted  were  significantly  out 
of  line  with  data  submitted  two  years  earlier — as

being  not  countable  as  treaty-limited  equipment. 

February  15.  The  United  States  and  other  NATO

while  nationalism  grew  rapidly  in  the  Soviet 
republics. 

October  18.  At  the  second  Extraordinary  Confer¬ 
ence  of  the  JCG,  held  in  Vienna,  the  Soviet  Union 
issued  a  political  declaration  stating  its  intention  to 
rapidly  withdraw  weapons  based  in  the  Baltics.

nia,  Bulgaria,  Poland,  and  Czechoslovakia — as¬ 
sembled  a  High  Level  Working  Group  in  Brussels. 
Of  the  member  states,  only  Kazakstan  did  not 
attend.  The  meeting  agreed  that  CFE  Treaty  obliga¬

Conference  in  Oslo,  Norway.  Twenty-nine  coun¬ 
tries  signed  the  Final  Document  of  the  Extraordi¬ 
nary  Conference  of  the  States  Parties  to  the  CFE 
Treaty.  The  document  removed  all  obstacles  to 
ratification  of  the  treaty  and  modified  language  of 
the  treaty  to  include  all  CIS  states  which  were  in  the 
ATTU,  legalizing  the  entry  of  the  new  states  into  the 
treaty  and  their  acceptance  of  the  obligations  of  the 
USSR.

July  10.  By  the  time  of  the  Helsinki  CSCE  Summit, 
three  nations — Armenia,  Belarus,  and  Kazakstan — 
had  not  yet  ratified  the  CFE  Treaty.  At  the  fourth 
JCG  Extraordinary  Conference,  held  concurrently 
with  the  CSCE  Summit,  the  CFE  Treaty  nations 
agreed  on  provisional  entry  into  force  of  the  treaty, 
which  would  allow  implementation  to  begin  while 
they  waited  for  the  remaining  three  countries  to 
ratify  the  treaty. 

July  10.  CFE  1A  was  signed  by  29  states  during  the

regime. 


July  17.  The  CFE  Treaty  provisionally  entered  into 
force,  limiting  five  major  categories  of  weapons, 
with  29  signatory  states.  When  the  remaining 
countries  deposited  their  instruments  of  ratification 
in  October,  it  was  agreed  to  make  full  entry  into 
force  retroactive  to  July  17.

September  22.  Fifty-four  member  states  of  the 
CSCE  follow-on  conference  created  the  Forum  for 
Security  Cooperation  (FSC)  mandate  for  new 
security  negotiations.  CFE  was  replaced  as  the 
primary  tool  for  conventional  arms  control  confi¬ 
dence  and  security  building  measures.  Unlike  the 
CFE  Treaty,  all  states  would  participate  individually 
and  not  as  alliances  or  military  blocs. 

October  12.  Armenia  deposited  its  CFE  instru¬ 
ments  of  ratification  in  The  Hague,  leaving  only 
two  nations  to  ratify  before  the  treaty  could  fully 
enter  into  force. 

October  3-9.  Following  a  German  inspection  of 
Naro-Fominsk,  Russia,  in  late  September,  two  U.S.

assurances  that  site  diagrams  would  be  corrected 
and  that  inspectors  would  have  full  access  at  de¬ 
clared  objects  of  verification  (OOVs). 

October  30.  The  final  two  CFE  ratification  instru¬ 
ments,  those  of  Belarus  and  Kazakstan,  were  depos¬

1993  January.  NATO’s  Verification  Coordinating  Com¬ 
mittee  (VCC)  invited  the  participation  of  former 
Warsaw  Pact  guest  inspectors  on  its  teams.  Hosting 
guest  inspectors  from  NATO  nations  had  been  a 
common  practice  since  the  beginning  of  baseline, 
but  this  marked  the  first  time  NATO  had  invited 
inspectors  from  former  Eastern  bloc  nations  onto 
their  teams. 

April  28.  The  United  States  hosted  the  first  guest 
inspector  from  a  former  Warsaw  Pact  nation  on  one

flanks  as  a  serious  problem. 

November  17.  The  first  CFE  reduction  year  ended. 
All  signatories  met  their  25  percent  reduction 
liabilities  for  the  first  year,  with  the  exceptions  of 
Armenia  and  Azerbaijan. 

1994  March  21.  Russia  asked  the  JCG  to  consider 
modifying  the  CFE  Treaty  to  increase  the  amount  of 
TLE  that  could  be  taken  out  of  storage  and  the 
length  of  time  it  could  be  out  of  storage. 

March  23.  Belarus  threatened  to  cease  its  CFE 
reductions  because  of  high  costs,  unless  it  received 
assistance  from  other  nations. 

March  31.  The  United  States  gave  $10  million  to 
be  divided  between  Belarus  and  Ukraine  to  help 
finance  their  CFE  reductions. 

May  15.  A  U.S.  guest  inspector  took  part  for  the 
first  time  in  an  inspection  conducted  by  a  former 
Warsaw  Pact  nation.  Major  Mark  Lieber,  USMC, 
served  on  a  Bulgarian  inspection  in  Romania. 

September  19.  For  the  first  time,  a  U.S.  CFE  inspec¬ 
tion  team  included  a  Russian  guest  inspector. 

OSIA’s  Lt.  Col.  Fred  E.  Busing  led  this  team  on  a 
declared  site  inspection  in  Oradea,  Romania. 


November  13.  The  CFE  Treaty’s  second  reduction 
year  ended.  All  but  two  nations  had  met  their  60 
percent  reduction  goals. 

December  4.  At  the  CSCE  Summit  in  Budapest,  the 
52  nations  of  the  CSCE  signed  the  Vienna  Docu¬ 
ment  1994,  which  replaced  the  Vienna  Document 
1992  and  expanded  on  its  confidence  and  security 
building  measures.  At  the  same  time,  the  Confer¬ 
ence  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe 
changed  its  name  to  the  Organization  for  Security 
and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (OSCE). 

1995  January  10.  The  United  States  agreed  that  Russian 
forces  in  Chechnya  did  not  constitute  a  CFE  Treaty 
violation,  since  flank  limits  did  not  come  into  effect 
until  the  end  of  the  reduction  period  in  November. 
After  that,  they  would  still  not  be  a  violation,  since 
the  treaty  allowed  temporary  deployments. 

February  23.  President  Alexander  Lukashenka 
announced  that  Belarus  would  suspend  all  CFE 
reduction  activities  because  of  the  cost,  which  he 
called  “economically  unjust,”  since  Belarus  did  not 
produce  the  weapons  left  behind  when  the  Soviet 
Union  dissolved  but  still  had  responsibility  for 
destroying  them.  Belarus  did  state,  however,  that 
reductions  could  begin  again  if  financing  was  made 
available. 

May  10.  At  a  Clinton/Yeltsin  summit  meeting  in 
Moscow,  the  United  States  told  Russia  that  it  would 
not  support  modification  to  the  CFE  Treaty  until 
the  review  conference  in  May  1996. 

September  12.  Russia,  Belarus,  Ukraine,  and 
Kazakstan  announced  that  they  would  not  be  able 
to  meet  their  reduction  liabilities  by  the  end  of  the 
reduction  period.  Ukraine  said  it  could  meet  its 
commitments  with  the  exception  of  TLE  assigned  to 
the  Black  Sea  Fleet,  which  it  could  not  reduce  until 
the  equipment  in  the  fleet  was  divided  between 
Ukraine  and  Russia.  The  other  three  nations 
blamed  economic  difficulties. 

October  15.  Belarus  resumed  its  reduction  of 
treaty-limited  equipment,  but  stated  it  would  not  be 
able  to  meet  its  remaining  reduction  liability  by  the 
end  of  the  reduction  period  in  November. 

November  17.  The  CFE  reduction  period  ended. 
The  treaty  nations  issued  a  joint  statement  identify¬ 
ing  the  countries  that  were  not  in  compliance  with 
their  treaty  obligations:  Armenia,  Azerbaijan, 
Belarus,  Russia,  and  Ukraine.  Despite  some  coun¬ 
tries’  failing  to  fully  meet  their  reduction  liabilities, 
the  amount  of  equipment  reduced  by  the  CFE 
Treaty  constituted  the  largest  negotiated  arms 
reduction  in  history,  with  over  50,000  pieces  of 
equipment  destroyed.  This  equipment  included 
19,200  battle  tanks,  18,600  armed  combat  vehicles, 
9,800  pieces  of  artillery,  2,200  combat  aircraft,  and 
370  attack  helicopters.

Appendix  G:  Chronology 


November  17.  The  residual  level  validation  period 
(RLVP)  began.  This  120-day  “second  baseline” 
confirmed  the  accuracy  of  national  reductions, 
recategorizations,  and  relocations  of  equipment 
declared  after  the  reduction  period. 

November  25.  Russia  and  Ukraine  reached  an 
agreement  on  division  of  the  Black  Sea  Fleet. 
Ukraine  would  receive  150  naval  installations  of  the 
fleet  in  the  agreement. 

November  28.  The  Joint  Consultative  Group  gave 
Belarus  an  extension  until  April  26,  1996,  to  com¬ 
plete  its  reductions  of  treaty-limited  equipment. 

The  United  States  and  Germany  agreed  to  assist 
Belarus  in  its  reduction  effort. 

December  31.  Russia  failed  to  meet  its  deadline  for 
reducing  TLE  it  had  moved  east  of  the  Urals  prior 
to  treaty  signature.  Russia  cited  economic  difficul¬ 
ties  and  requested  that  the  JCG  extend  the  deadline 
until  1998. 


1996  March  16.  The  residual  level  validation  period 

ended.  During  the  120-day  RLVP,  NATO  nations 
conducted  246  inspections  of  Eastern  bloc  nations. 
Of  these,  the  United  States  led  38  inspections  and 
provided  guest  inspectors  to  56  teams  led  by  other 
nations.  The  Eastern  bloc  nations  inspected  NATO 
nations  183  times,  with  U.S.  sites  in  Europe  receiv¬ 
ing  11  inspections. 

April  26.  Belarus  did  not  complete  its  reductions  in 
time  for  the  deadline  proposed  in  its  November 
1995  plan. 

May  15-31.  The  30  treaty  nations  held  the  CFE 
Review  Conference  in  Vienna.  The  Final  Document 
of  the  conference  included  compromises  on  the 
flank  issue,  east  of  the  Urals  reductions,  and  other 
issues.
