Now  day’s  the  power  factor  has  become  a  major  problem  in  power  system  to 
improve  the  power  quality  of  the  grid,  as  power  factor  is  affected  on  the  grid 
due  to  the  nonlinear  loads  connected  to  it.  Single  phase  bridgeless  AC/DC 
power  factor  correction  (PFC)  topology  to  improve  the  power  factor  as  well 
as  the  total  harmonic  distortion  (THD)  of  the  utility  grid  is  proposed.  By 
removing  the  input  bridge  in  conventional  PFC  converters,  the  control  circuit 
is  simplified;  the  total  harmonics  distortion  (THD)  and  power  factor  (PF)  are 
improved.  The  PI  controller  operates  in  two  loops  one  is  the  outer  control 
loop  which  calculates  the  reference  current  through  LC  filter  and  signal 
processing.  Inner  current  loop  generates  PWM  switching  signals  through  the 
PI  controller.  The  output  of  the  proposed  PFC  topology  is  verified  for 
prototype  using  MATLAB  circuit  simulations.  The  experimental  system  is 
developed,  and  the  simulation  results  are  obtained.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

The  purpose  of  improving  power  quality  of  the  AC  system  has  become  excessive  interest  from  years 
ago.  There  is  huge  usage  of  power  electronic  devices,  such  as  variable  speed  drives,  uncontrolled  rectifiers 
and  other  switching  devices,  these  devices  affects  the  power  quality  of  the  utility  grid  significantly  .To 
decrease  harmonics  in  transmission  lines,  the  Research  on  active  power  factor  correction  (PFC)  techniques 
has  taken  on  an  accelerated  path  typical  PFC  converter  topologies  are  boost  Buck-  boost  [8],  buck  and  SEPIC 
[2-5]. The  boost  converter  is  rarely  used  in  practical  applications,  as  the  input  current  can  be  easily  formed 
into  a  sinusoidal  waveform  to  maintain  unity  power  factor.  However,  the  boost  PFC  converter  [8]  has  a 
restricted  capability  since  the  peak  value  of  the  AC  input  voltage  must  be  lesser  than  the  DC  output  voltage. 
On  the  other  hand,  the  DC  output  voltage  of  the  buck  PFC  is  lower  than  the  peak  of  the  AC  input  voltage, 
which  reduces  the  cost  and  the  rating  of  the  component.  A  buck  PFC  converter  [9-11]  gives  an  alternative  for 
low- voltage  applications  such  as  a  48V  DC  bus.  The  buck  converter  has  high  efficiency  for  entire  input 
voltage  range  with  distorted  input  current  that  comfortably  crosses  the  limits  imposed  by  IEC  requirements. 

A  buck  PFC  AC/DC  converter  provides  an  alternative  option  for  low-voltage  applications  [15]. 
Unlike  in  the  boost  chopper,  the  output  voltage  of  the  buck  chopper  is  lower  than  the  peak  of  the  input  ac 
voltage,  and  this  significant  feature  allows  the  low  voltage  rating  of  switching  devices  to  be  used  in  the 
converter,  which  can  significantly  reduce  the  component  cost  [17].  On  the  one  hand,  depending  on  the 
application,  a  resonant  converter  can  be  excluded  from  the  buck  converter  topology.  The  input  current  of  the 
buck  PFC  converter  has  dead  zones  along  the  cycle,  which  requires  extensive  passive  filtering  to  improve  the 
power  factor  [16].  The  conventional  SEPIC  converter  can  supply  a  high -power  factor  in  wide  range  of 
voltage  conditions  [12-13].  The  output  voltage  could  be  reduced  or  increased  without  the  need  of  inversion 
with  the  SEPIC  converters  [14].

This  introduces  a  new  topology  for  single  phase  bridgeless  AC/DC  PFC  converters.  This  used  to 
reduce  the  THD  and  increasing  PF  of  the  operation.  In  Section  1  Proposed  SEPIC  converter  combines  the 
bridge  and  DC-DC  stages  into  one  stage.  Section2  analyses  operation  of  the  proposed  SEPIC  PFC  converter. 
In  Section3  component  selection  and  control  circuit  design  are  presented.  The  simulation  results  of  the 
conventional  and  proposed  SEPIC  converter  are  presented.  Summary  and  future  work  is  provided  in  it. 


2.  NEED  FOR  IMPROVING  POWER  FACTOR 

Power  factor  is  the  ratio  of  Real  power  flowing  to  the  load  to  the  apparent  power  in  the  circuit.  Ideal 
power  factor  is  1  and  device  consumes  all  the  power  it  draws.  The  range  of  power  factor  is  lies  between  to  -1 
to  +1.  The  benefits  of  power  factor  correction  is 

i.  To  reduce  losses 

ii.  To  protect  devices  from  high  currents 

iii.  Power  quality  is  improved 

iv.  Reduction  of  electricity  bills 

Power  factor  is  dependent  on  load  so  vary  according  to  the  loads.  Linear  loads  with 
factor  can  be  corrected  with  passive  network  of  capacitors  or  inductors.  Non-linear  loads  with 
factor  can  destroy  the  current  from  the  system.  In  such  active  or  passive  networks  is  used 
distortion  of  current  and  by  improving  the  power  factor. 

3.  PROPOSED  BRIDGELESS  SEPIC  PFC  CONVERTER 

Proposed  SEPIC  converter  combines  the  bridge  and  DC-DC  stages  into  one  stage  .We  simplified  the 
controller  circuit  by  eliminating  the  input  bridge  in  conventional  PFC  converters,  the  total  harmonic 
distortion  [THD]  and  power  factor  [PF]  are  improved.  The  proposed  converter  is  able  to  reduce  the  THD 
2.83%  from5.72%  and  improve  the  power  factor  to  0.998.The  proposed  bridgeless  SEPIC  PFC  converter 
topology  provides  much  better  performance  than  conventional  SEPIC  PFC  converter.  The  proposed 
converter  single  phase  bridgeless  SEPIC  PFC  is  better  for  lower  power  equipment  especially  those  requiring 
high  quality  input  power  .The  operation  of  the  conventional  SEPIC  PFC  converter  circuit  can  be  separated  in 
to  two  modes  depending  on  the  position  of  the  switches.  When  the  switch  Qi  switched  on,  output  diode  D 
acts  as  reverse  biased.  The  input  inductor  LI  gets  charge,  then  output  inductor  L2  and  AC  input  capacitor  Ci 
creates  a  resonant  circuit.  Here,  load  draws  current  from  the  output  capacitor  Co.  During  this  time  of 
operation,  the  voltage  of  the  input  inductor  will  be  equal  with  the  rectified  AC  voltage  Vac-  Input  capacitor 
voltage  and  output  inductor  voltage  are  also  equal  to  Vac  during  this  first  mode  of  operation.  In  the  second 
mode,  the  Ql switch  is  turned  off,  then  the  diode  D  is  forward  biased  and  Li,  Ci,  L2  creates  a  loop.  The  load 
is  directly  connected  to  the  inductors  during  in  second  mode,  which  will  discharge  them  during  the  mode  of 
operation  Figure  1 .

The  proposed  bridgeless  SEPIC  PFC  converter  bridge  diode  system  replaced  with  three  active 
switches  which  is  shown  in  Figure  2.  When  all  the  switches  such  as  (9l,  23  and  24  turn  on,  input  inductor 
currents  are  linearly  increasing.  The  output  inductor  voltage  is  equal  to  the  capacitance  voltage  Ci  which  was 
equal  input  voltage  before  all  the  switches  are  turned  on.  Thereby,  L2  reduces  linearly.  This  mode  ends  by 
turning  off  2i,  23  and  Qa.  By  turning  2i,  23  and  Qa  off,  Diode  D  starts  to  conduct.  Then  Input  inductors 
current  reduces  linearly  and  output  inductors  current  increases  linearly  until  the  diode  current  extinguishes. 
When  D  turns  off,  output  side  is  detached  from  the  input  side,  the  current  through  the  inductors  freewheel  at 
the  input  side.  Working  modes  for  proposed  SEPIC  PFC  converter  is  provided. 


4.  PRINCIPLE  OF  OPERATION 

Since  the  proposed  SEPIC  converter  circuit  consists  of  two  symmetrical  structures  as  shown  in  Fig. 
3,  this  circuit  is  mainly  used  for  the  positive  half  cycle  structure.  Suggesting  that  the  circuit  working  in  a 
positive  half  cycle  of  a  switching  period  Ts  can  be  divided  into  three  working  modes  and  it  can  be  defined  as 
follows. 

Mode  1.  In  this  mode,  Ql,  Q3  and  Q4  switches  are  turned  on.  In  this  mode  of  operation  shown  in  fig.  1,  the 
output  inductor  currents  decreases  and  input  inductor  current  increases  linearly  at  a  rate  of  proportional  to  the 
input  voltage  Vac. 

Mode  2.  In  this  mode,  Ql,  Q3  and  Q4  switches  are  turned  off,  but  Ql  and  Q4  are  conducting  through  anti 
parallel  body  diodes  shown  in  fig. 2.  Then  forward  diode  D  is  turned  on,  providing  a  path  for  the  input  and 
output  inductor  currents.  In  this  mode,  the  input  inductor  currents  are  linearly  decrease,  at  the  rate  of 
proportional  to  the  output  voltage  Vdc  and  output  inductor  current  linearly  increase. 

Mode  3.  In  this  mode,  all  the  active  switches  are  turned  off,  as  shown  in  below  fig  5.  Ql  and  Q4  are 
conducting  through  anti  parallel  body  diodes.  This  mode  ends  by  the  next  switching  cycle.  In  this  mode,  the 
inductors  LI,  L2  and  L3  currents  are  equal.  The  switch  voltage  and  diode  voltage  are  equal  input  voltage  Vac 
and  output  voltage  Vdc  respectively.

4.1  Block  Diagram 

The  block  diagram  consists  of  power  factor  improvement  unit  based  on  microcontroller  which 
consist  of  SEPIC  PFC  converter  and  PI  controller.  The  input  is  in  the  form  of  AC.  Bridgeless 
rectifier/Bridgeless  SEPIC  converter  is  used  to  convert  AC  to  DC.  The  DC  voltage  is  given  to  DC  to  DC 
converter;  output  of  converter  is  fed  to  different  types  of  load.  The  PI  controller  is  used  to  calculate  power 
factor  by  using  phase  difference  between  voltage  and  current.  The  DSPIC30F  devices  contain  extensive 
Digital  Signal  Processor  (DSP)  functionality  within  a  high  performance  16-bit  microcontroller  (MCU) 
architecture.  Device  block  diagrams  for  the  dsPIC30F4011  and  dsPIC30F4012  device. 


4.2  Proportional  Integral  (PI)  Control 

The  combination  of  proportional  and  integral  terms  is  important  to  increase  the  speed  of  the 
response  and  to  eliminate  the  steady  state.  The  multi  loop  control  is  proposed  for  the  converter,  outer  voltage 
controller  generating  the  reference  current  to  regulate  the  DC  voltage  and  the  inner  PI  controller  generating 
the  gating  signals  as  shown  in  Figure  4.  The  high  frequency  switching  of  the  converter  produces  switching 
ripples  on  the  DC  voltage.  Thus,  the  measured  DC  voltage  is  processed  through  a  band  stop  filter  to  eliminate 
the  noise  on  the  measurements.

compared  with  the  simulation  to  improve  the  power  factor  (PF)  as  well  as  Total  Harmonic  Distortion  (THD) 
in  grid  applications.  The  full  bridge  consisting  of  diode  in  input  is  removed  and  replaced  by  bridgeless  SEPIC 
converter.  Topology  are  compared  with  conventional  SEPIC  converter,  the  proposed  bridgeless  SEPIC  PFC 
topology  provides  much  better  performance  than  conventional  SEPIC  PFC  converter.  The  topology  is 
implemented  on  a  converter  operating  from  25V  AC  input  to  generate  into  10V  DC.  By  this  we  can  achieve 
high  PF  and  low  THD.
