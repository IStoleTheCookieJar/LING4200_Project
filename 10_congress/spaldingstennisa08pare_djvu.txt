THE 
NATIONAL  CHAMPIONSHIP  TOURNAMENT 


The  twenty-third  annual  open  tournament  for  the  amateur 
championship  of  the  United  States  began  on  Tuesday,  August 
18,  and  continued  until  Wednesday  of  the  following  week,  on 
the  courts  of  the  Casino  at  Newport,  R.  I.  The  entry  list  was 
slightly  smaller  than  that  of  the  previous  year,  as  it  comprised 
but  seventy-nine  players,  among  them  being  every  one  of  the 
leading  American  experts  and  including  the  English  challenging 
team,  H.  L.  Doherty,  Reginald  F.  Doherty  and  Harold  S.  Ma- 
hony.  The  tournament,  in  the  eyes  of  the  American  followers  of 
the  sport  assumed  at  the  outset  even  greater  importance  than 
the  international  competitions  for  the  Dwight  F.  Davis  chal- 
lenge cup.  This  was  because  of  the  disastrous  ending  to  the 
international  matches  in  which  the  Doherty  brothers  had  gained 
such  a  signal  triumph  over  the  American  defenders.  It  was 
hoped  that  in  addition  to  losing  the  challenge  cup  the  Americans 
would  not  suffer  the  carrying  off  of  their  national  title  in  the 
singles,  and  that  possibly  the  championship  in  the  doubles  might 
be  regained  from  the  Dohertys,  who  the  year  previous  had  de- 
feated Davis  and  Ward.  As  the  tournament  progressed  day 
by  day,  the  interest  became  most  intense,  until  the  challenge 
match  for  the  American  title  had  been  finished  and  the  Doherty 
brothers   scored  a  complete  sweep  on  the  American  courts. 

The  draw  proved  rather  good,  as  it  brought  the  Dohertys 
into  the  upper  section  where  they  met  fairly  representative 
players,  while  in  the  lower  section  it  gave  the  American  experts 
an  opportunity  to  bring  out  a  strong  man  to  the  finals.  The 
elder  Doherty  gained  his  place  in  the  fifth  round  without  any 
particular  difficulty,  excepting  that  which  he  experienced  when 
he  met  Kriegh  Collins,  the  Chicagoan  on  the  afternoon  of  the 
famous  challenge  match  in  the  doubles.  Doherty  was  badly 
played  out,  while  Collins  proved  to  be  comparatively  fresh,  and 
lie  came  near  to  playing   the   Englishman   off  his   feet.     It  was 


W.  A.  LARNED 
Ex-Champion  of  America 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL.  9 

only  by  the  greatest  exertion  on  Doherty's  part  that  he  was  able 
to  overcome  Collins  and  gain  his  place  in  the  fifth  round.  In 
this  round  the  elder  Doherty  met  his  brother,  H.  L.  Doherty, 
who  had  in  the  previous  round  defeated  Mahoney.  The  agree- 
ment had  been  made  previous  to  the  playing  of  the  tournament 
that  if  the  brothers  were  to  meet,  the  British  champion,  H.  L. 
Doherty,  was  to  be  allowed  to  go  through,  so  the  elder  brother 
defaulted  to  the  younger.  H.  L.  Doherty  then  defeated  R.  H. 
Carleton  in  the  semi-finals  and  took  his  place  in  the  final  round 
against    William   J.    Clothier. 

Clothier  had  previously  beaten  young  E.  P.  Larned  in  the 
semi-finals  and  in  the  fifth  round  had  defeated  the  Pennsylvanian, 
Harry    F.    Allen. 

Much  credit  is  to  be  given  Clothier  for  his  excellent  work 
against  H.  L.  Doherty  in  the  finals.  He  did  even  better  than 
was  expected  of  him,  but  the  doughty  little  Englishman  repeated 
the  victory  that  he  had  scored  on  the  Southampton  courts  two 
weeks  previous  and  defeated  the  American  in  three  straight 
sets,  the  score  being  6/3,  6/2,  6/3.  Though  throughout  this 
match  Doherty  did  not  risk  anything  with  the  American, 
but  played  very  fast  and  accurate  tennis.  His  killing  was 
far  more  certain  than  it  had  been  in  any  of  his  previous 
competitions  on  the  American  courts,  and  the  only  difficulty 
which  he  seemed  to  experience  was  in  passing  Clothier,  who 
did  not  for  a  moment  leave  any  portion  of  his  court  unguarded. 
The  fact  is,  that  Clothier  displayed  splendid  generalship  in  his 
method  of  attack,  and  he  was  frequently  able  to  pass  the  Eng- 
lishman. But  more  than  anything  else  it  was  the  deadly  ac- 
curacy of  the  British  champion's  play  which  overcame  the  Ameri- 
can and  finally  gave  to  H.  L.  Doherty  the  coveted  right  and 
privilege  of  challenging  for  the  American  singles  champion- 
ship, which  had  been  won  the  previous  year  by  William  A. 
Larned,  defeating  R.  F.  Doherty. 

The  challenge  match  between  the  veteran  Larned  and  the 
"little"  Doherty  brought  out  one  of  the  largest  gatherings  ever 
assembled  on  the  historic  Casino  courts.  The  enthusiasm  was 
market!  mid  in  favor  of  Larned,  the  crowd  being  strictly  partisan 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  H 

and  while  they  wished  for  a  hard-fought  battle  over  the  net, 
they  distinctly  wanted  the  American  title  to  remain  at  home. 
There  was  much  uneasiness,  however,  because  of  Doherty's  vic- 
tory over  Larned  in  the  Internationals  and  the  fact  that  the 
courts  were  rather  slow  and  the  day  well  suited  to  the  Eng- 
lishman. 

The  American  began  so  poorly,  and  with  such  evident  nervous- 
ness that  Doherty  took  the  first  set  at  love..  Out  of  the  thirty 
points  which  the  Englishman  scored  in  this  set  Larned  presented 
him  with  twenty-four  of  the  points  by  errors  of  play.  These  errors 
were  all  counted  on  outs  and  nets  and  Larned  appeared  most 
vacillating  in  his  method  of  play,  first  attempting  to  take  the 
net  and  then  giving  way  to  the  base  line.  It  was  not  until  the 
thirteenth  game  of  the  match  that  Larned  was  able  to  score  and 
then  he  beat  Doherty  at  30,  by  playing  two  well-played  passes. 

From  this  point  Larned  began  to  play  up  in  something  near  to 
his  usual  form,  but  he  came  so  slowly  that  Doherty  took  the 
second  set  at  6/3  before  the  American  really  got  well  started.  In 
the  third  set  Larned  took  the  opening  game  and  by  his  clever 
passing,  which  assumed  a  brilliancy  that  plainly  disturbed  the 
Englishman,  he  was  able  to  get  the  lead  at  3/2,  but  Doherty 
changed  this  and  steadily  wore  the  American  down  by  playing  a 
hard,  fast  and  accurate  game.  Toward  the  last  of  the  set,  after 
deuce  had  been  reached  at  5-all,  the  points  came  with  difficulty 
for  each  of  the  players.  Several  times  Larned  seemed  to  be 
about  to  take  the  set  when  apparently  his  nervousness  overcame 
his  ability  to  play  tennis,  and  he  lost  the  opportunity.  At  8-all 
Doherty  appeared  to  be  fagged  out  and  the  little  Englishman 
seemed  to  realize  it.  He  made  one  great  rally  and  to  this  rally 
he  owed  the  victory,  for  Larned  had  become  dangerously  bril- 
liant and  had  not  Doherty  been  able  to  beat  him  on  the  seven- 
teenth and  eighteenth  games  it  is  more  than  likely  that  the 
annals  of  the  sport  would  have  a  different  tale  to  tell.  Larned's 
defeat  was  purely  due  to  his  strained  and  nervous  condition 
which  made  it  impossible  for  him  to  play  the  tennis  which  he  is 
capable  of  showing.  When  this  nervousness  wore  off  Doherty 
was  so  close  to  victory  that  is  was  impossible  for  the  American 


SPALDING'S     LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL.  13

In  the  doubles  there  were  two  brillian  matches  that  occu- 
pied the  chief  attention  during  the  first  two  days.  Collins  and 
Waidner.  who  had  won  the  Western  championship,  met  Ward 
and  Ware,  the  winners  of  the  Eastern  championships,  and  who 
were  general!}*  believed  to  be  the  premier  pair  of  the  American 
courts.  The  Westerners  were  thought  to  be  outclassed  mainly 
bcause  of  their  showing  on  the  courts  of  the  Country  Club  of 
Westchester.  The  outcome  of  the  match,  however,  was  a 
complete     overturning     of     the     Eastern     champions     by     the 

rners,  who  defeated  them  in  three  straight  sets,  the 
being  6/3,  6/4,  7/3.  The  work  of  Waidner  proved  to  be  the 
revelation  of  the  match,  and  he  had  steadied  down  from  his 
erratic  play  of  a  year  ago.  Ward  and  Ware  with  their  record 
of  but  one  defeat  during  the  season,  and  with  the  credit  of  a 
sensational  win  from  Larned  and  Wright  at  Long- 
the  strong  favorites  and  their  reversal  of  form  was.  to  say  the 
irprising.  While  not  desiring  to  detract  from  the  worth 
of  Collins  and  Waidner's  victory,  it  must  be  said  that  Ward 
and  Ware  did  not  play  their  game,  nor  anywhere  near  it.  They 
lacked  force  and  aggressiveness  and  the  method  offered  could 
not  have  been  better  for  the  Westerners  to  make  holes  through 
and  win.  Collins  and  Waidner  were  certainly  at  the  pinnacle  of 
their  game.  They  came  eagerly  to  the  net.  strenuously  aggres- 
sive, and  to  these  tactics  Ward  and  Ware  erred  in  offerinsr  the 
short  game  in  the  beginning.  Lacking  in  force  it  was  an 
ineffectual  effort  and  Collins  and  Waidner  found  no  difficulty  in 
handling  this  kind  of  attack.     They  met  it  at   even,-  hand  with 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL.  13 

success.  The  Western  pair  played  with  directness  right  at 
Ware,  their  method  being  to  lob  to  him  and  then  run  in  on 
his  smash.  It  worked  to  a  dot,  and  they  kept  at  it  until  their 
final  triumph.  Collins'  play  showed  to  the  best  advantage  of 
the  four,  and  his  cross  courts  and  volleys  were  splendidly  done. 
He  was  a  shade  the  unsteadier  of  the  Western  team,  though  his 
earned  shots  offset  this.    The  score :

CHAMPIONSHIP    DOUBLES. 
Final     round — Kreigh     Collins     and     L.     H.     Waidner,     winners     of     Western 

doubles,    defeated   Holcomb   Ward   and   Leonard    E.    Ware,    winners   of   the 

Eastern   doubles,    6/3,    6, 4,    7, 5. 
Challenge  round — R.   F.   and  H.   L.   Doherty    (holders)   defeated  Kriegh  Collins 

and  L.    H.   Waidner   (challengers),   7/5,   6/3,   6,  3. 

There  was  considerable  speculation  previous  to  the  playing 
of  the  challenge  match  in  the  doubles,  because  of  the  fact  that 
Collins  and  Waidner  had  been  able  to  play  the  Dohertys  a  five- 
set  match  a  year  ago.  It  was  evident  from  the  start  of  the  con- 
test, however,  that  the  Englishman  felt  no  misgivings  as  to 
the  ultimate  end  of  the  competition.  Both  volleyed  and  drove 
wjth  accuracy  and  speed  and  their  placing  was  keen  and  true. 
H.  L.  Doherty's  cross  court  kills  from  right  at  the  net  were 
almost  sure  for  earned  aces.  R.  F.  Doherty  was  not  far  behind 
him,  though  not  so  steady,  and  to  him  fell  the  portion  of  bearing 
the  brunt  of  the  American  attack.  It  was  noticed  that  in  re- 
ceiving the  English  pair  stood  one  up  at  the  net  and  one  back  all 
the  while,  the  Americans  not  being  so  successful  in  forcing  them 
to  change  as  were  the  Wrenns  at  Longwood.  They  were  in 
position  every  time  but  one.  Their  use  of  the  once-despised  lob 
was  frequent  and  effective,  ?nd  the  really  good  lobbing  by  the 
Americans  had  no  terrors  for  them.  The  stand  by  the  American 
team  wa?.  in  a  way,  a  triumph  for  Kriegh  Collins,  and  it  was 
evident  that  with  a  partner  nearer  his  ability  he  would  have 
stretched  the  English  pair  to  the  limit. 

There  was  a  lack  of  balance  to  the  American  team,  which 
materially  weakened  its  effort.  Waidner  was  not  as  strong  or 
effective  as  he  might  have  been,  and  as  a  result  Collins  was 
called  upon  to.  and  did,  assume  more  than  his  share  of  the  work 
during  the  three  sets.  Collins  volleyed  well,  killed  with  effect, 
and  his  lobs  were  high,  deep  and  timely.  Waidner  at  times 
would  get  the  strokes  going  well,  but  he  was  inclined  to  slow 
and  shorten  up  when  length  and  speed  were  demanded. 

Of  the   four   players   H.   L.   Doherty   showed   to  the  best   ad-

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  19 

vantage,  even  allowing  for  the  apparent  weakness  of  his  service. 
He  was  by  long  odds  the  steadiest,  and  his  only  fault  was  netting 
the  ball,  most  of  which  errors  were  forehand  off  the  ground.  For 
some  reason  his  service  was  not  effective,  Collins  and  Waidner 
repeatedly  breaking  through  and  winning  off  it.  When  the  pinch 
came,  and  it  counted  most,  each  time,  however,  it  was  noted 
that  he  won  his  service.  R.  F.'s  service  was  very  keen  and  he 
did  not  lose  it  once.  Collins  lost  his  twice  and  Waidner's  was 
gone  through  six  times. 

The  play  all  along  was  marked  by  brilliant  periods,  and  some 
of  the  rallies  rivalled  any  seen  here  in  a  long  time,  the  players 
working  all  over  the  court  in  the  effort  to  turn  the  point.  The 
first  set  was  a  splendid  exhibition,  and  at  times  it  pointed  to 
at  least  a  set  win  for  the  American  pair.  When  they  had  the 
lead,  3/2,  and  then  5/4,  it  seemed  that  their  chances  were  good. 
The  effort  was  not  sustained  from  the  latter  point,  and  the 
Englishman  after  deucing  the  set  secured  the  vantage  off 
Waidner's  service  and  the  win  by  H.  L.'s  after  he  had  lost  all 
of  his  to  this  point.  Nets  ty  the  Americans  were  fatal  in 
this  set. 

In  the  second  set,  after  the  Dohertys  had  swung  into  a  lead 
of  3-love,  the  Americans  made  a  stand  for  two  games  and  then, 
after  4/2,  got  their  third  and  last  of  the  set.  Only  once  did  the 
Americans  lead  in  the  last  set  and,  though  they  stood  for  3-all, 
there  the  effort  ended.  The  Dohertys  were  full  of  confidence,  and 
from  3-all  they  had  their  opponents  on  the  run,  taking  three 
games  in  succession,  the  last  being  once  at  deuce,  and  the  set, 
match  and  championship  was  theirs  again.

SPALDING'S     LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL. 


INTERNATIONAL   CHAMPIONSHIPS   OF   1903 


At  the  time  that  Dwight  F.  Davis  offered  the  international 
lawn  tennis  challenge  cup,  four  years  ago,  for  competition,  sev- 
eral of  the  experts  declared  that  if  the  Britons  wanted  to  capture 
the  trophy  they  had  only  to  send  the  Doherty  brothers  as  the 
challenging  team.  The  results  of  play  on  the  courts  of  the  Long- 
wood  Cricket  Club,  at  Boston,  last  August,  made  this  declaration 
appear  in  the  light  of  a  prophecy.  In  a  series  of  matches  that  were 
in  every  way  the  most  remarkable  that  have  thus  far  been  waged 
for  the  trophy,  H.  L.  Doherty,  the  English  singles  champion, 
and  his  eldest  brother,  Reginald  F.  Doherty,  alone  and  unaided 
by  the  other  member  of  their  team,  Harold  S.  Mahony,  defeated 
the  American  defending  players  in  a  decisive  and  humiliating 
manner.  The  racket  work  of  the  Englishmen  stamped  them  as 
the  superiors  of  any  men  in  the  tennis  ranks  in  this  country  at 
the  present  time.  The  only  reservation  that  could  be  made  would 
be  that  at  the  height  of  his  game  it  is  probable  that  Malcolm  D. 
Whitman  would  possibly  be  successful  against  either  of  the 
Dohertys  in  three  matches  out  of  five. 

The  humiliating  feature  of  the  competition  lies  in  the  fact  that 
the  Americans  were  unable  to  earn  a  point.  The  Britons  actually 
earned  all  of  their  four  points  by  virtue  of  H.  L.  Doherty's  defeat 
of  Robert  D.  Wrenn  and  William  A.  Larned  in  the  singles  and 
also  in  the  same  event  by  R.  F.  Doherty's  defeat  of  Robert  D. 
Wrenn.  Paired  in  the  doubles,  the  Doherty  brothers  overcame 
the  team  composed  of  Robert  D.  Wrenn  and  his  younger  brother, 
George  L.  Wrenn,  Jr.  Only  one  point  was  scored  for  the 
American  side,  and  that  was  taken  by  William  A.  Larned  on  +he 
opening  day  of  the  series,  Tuesday,  August  4,  because  of  the  de- 
fault of  R.  F.  Doherty  to  him  in  the  singles.  There  was  some 
adverse  criticism  of  Larned's  action,  but  the  American  did  the 
only  thing  that  was  possible  under  the  rules,  for  it  would  have 
been  obviously  unfair  to  have  started  the  contests  with  Mahony 
and  in  the  later  matches  to  have  finished  with  R.  F.  Doherty. 


30  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

While  the  outcome  of  the  series  was  not  entirely  unexpected,, 
the  Americans  were  shown  to  be  weakest  where  the  Britons 
proved  themselves  the  better  men.  This  was  on  the  way  in 
which  they  worked  through  the  matches  with  a  steadiness  that 
was  deadly  to  the  hopes  of  the  several  thousand  ardent  followers 
of  the  sport  who  gathered  each  day  to  the  number  of  several 
thousands  to  witness  the  contests.  Often,  after  a  championship 
title  and  trophy  have  changed  hands  in  any  branch  of  sport,  it  is 
difficult  to  epitomize  the  exact  causes  for  the  victory  of  one  player 
and  the  downfall  of  the  other.  This  is  not  at  all  the  case  in  the 
present  instance,  for  the  most  critical  analysis  of  the  work  of  the 
competitors  indicates  that  it  was  that  remarkable  ability  to  keep 
to  the  game  without  wavering  or  swerving  from  their  misfortunes 
or  opportunities  that  beat  down  the  Americans  and  brought  the 
Britons  through  to  a  triumphant  victory.  Such  steadiness  as  the 
Dohertys  exhibited  is  not  often  seen  on  the  courts  of  this  country. 
Indeed  it  is  not  a  part  of  the  composition  of  the  American  athlete 
or  sportsman,  no  matter  what  branch  he  may  follow.  Here  the 
heritage  is  a  bundle  of  nerves  that  lift  to  topmost  flights  and  sink 
to  depressing  depths  ;  but  the  men  from  the  old  world  possess  the 
leavening  power  of  a  phlegmatic  temperament.  It  was  this  im- 
perturbable spirit  that  carried  the  Dohertys  along,  even  in  the 
face  of  the  most  brilliant  and  overwhelming  play  on  the  part  of 
the  Americans.  It  was  best  seen  in  the  long  five  set  matches  in 
which  it  played  the  important  part  in  the  final  outcome.  It  was 
absolutely  irresistible. 

Without  question,  the  most  disheartening  thing  about  the  series 
was  the  work  of  William  A.  Larned.  The  American  champion 
was  only  called  upon  to  participate  in  one  match— the  singles 
against  H.  L.  Doherty  on  the  final  day  of  the  series.  There  ap- 
peared to  be  little  balance  to  his  work,  for  he  varied  between 
flashes  of  rare  brilliancy  succeeded  by  periods  that  were  only 
mediocre.  When  Larned  was  at  his  best,  the  doughty  little 
Briton  could  not  approach  him  as  to  skill,  for  Larned  covered  his 
court  so  thoroughly  that  there  was  not  a  vulnerable  spot  for  the 
opposing  player  to  place  the  ball  with  the  hope  that  it  would  be 
successful  in  winning  the  point.     The  English  champion  seemed 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL.  31 

to  fully  realize  this,  and  at  such  times  he  only  endeavored  to  get 
the  ball  safely  back  across  the  net  without  trying  any  of  the  subtle 
tactics  that  the  Englishmen  displayed  when  they  felt  that  they 
were  not  treading  on  dangerous  ground.  Whenever  tne  two  men 
met  in  an  exchange  at  the  net  and  Larned  was  playing  fast,  he 
was  in  every  way  superior  to  the  English  champion.  Indeed,  had 
the  American  champion  been  at  all  times  forcefully  aggressive  the 
result  might  have  been  scored  differently  and  in  fewer  than  five 
sets.  As  it  was,  Larned  missed  the  victory  by  a  hairsbreadth. 
It  was  the  one  unfortunate  incident  of  the  match,  and  it  made  the 
final  outcome  most  unsatisfactory  to  the  spectators.  The  umpire 
failed  to  see  the  place  at  which  a  served  ball  struck  in  the  court, 
and  although  Larned  played  the  ball  and  won  the  point  the  um- 
pire ordered  it  replayed,  which,  of  course,  was  proper. 

Always  holding  himself  in  reserve,  the  Britisher  was  keen  to 
take  advantage  of  every  opening  that  was  afforded  in  the  opposing 
court.  He  found  it  impossible  to  be  as  active  as  Larned,  and  his 
work  was  not  so  high  pitched.  It  was  as  if  he  were  turned  in  a 
minor  key,  while  the  American  ran  the  gamut  between  diminu- 
endo and  crescendo.  The  only  weak  spot  in  his  playing  of  the 
strokes  appeared  to  be  on  his  forehand  off  the  ground,  and  this 
surely  was  not  to  be  expected.  H.  L.  Doherty,  on  all  other  strokes, 
would  be  a  difficult  man  for  whom  to  find  a  superior  ;  not  that  the 
strokes  in  themselves  were  any  better  played  than  the  American 
champions  when  they  came  off.  but  for  the  fact  that  he  played  with 
a  certainty  and  sureness  that  was  deadly  to  the  American  hopes, 
and  he  seldom,  if  ever,  risked  anything  when  making  a  return. 
The  great  force  which  the  little  Briton  put  into  his  strokes  with- 
out apparent  effort  was  somewhat  of  a  revelation  to  the  majority 
of  tennis  followers  in  this  country.  This  strength  was  best  seen 
in  his  drives  and  on  his  attempts  to  pass  his  opponent.  Then  the 
racket  hit  the  ball  with  a  long  full  sweep  that  gave  it  the  force  of 
every  pound  in  the  Englishman's  body,  and  sent  the  ball  hurtling 
over  the  net.  It  is  on  the  playing  of  these  strokes  that  the 
American  tennis  players  have  had  an  object  lesson  to  which  they 
may  well  give  heed.  This  was  because  Doherty  demonstrates 
that  he  was  able  to  earn  more  points  by  these  strokes  than  in  any 


32  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

other  way.  He  made  few  errors,  for  the  ball  always  traveled  fair 
to  the  mark  as  if  he  had  been  shooting  for  a  target. 

One  of  the  salient  features  of  the  match  was  the  way  in  which 
the  Englishman  handled  the  American's  lobbs.  It  was  at  once 
evident  that  their  visit  of  a  year  ago  had  caused  a  strengthening 
of  their  game,  particularly  in  this  direction,  for  both  of  the 
Dohertys  proved  to  be  adequately  able  to  return  lobbs  such  as 
beat  them  down  a  year  ago.  The  lobbs  of  Larned  and  the  Wrenns 
had  not  any  terrors  for  them.  They  did  not  make  the  mistake  of 
going  to  the  ball  too  quickly,  but  took  ample  time,  and  in  almost 
every  instance  from  the  back  of  the  court  endeavored  to  play  the 
deep  lobbs  for  a  pass,  for  it  was  behind  these  that  the  Americans 
tried  to  gain  the  position  at  the  net.  More  remarkable,  in  the 
light  of  the  work  of  last  year,  was  the  manner  in  which  they  had 
brought  themselves  up  to  the  point  of  being  able  to  smash  and 
kill  the  short  lobbs  at  the  net  in  the  true  American  fashion,  or 
something  that  was  very  like  it.  It  was  such  a  good  imitation 
that  it  was  generally  good  for  the  points.  At  no  time  on  their 
killing  strokes  did  they  appear  to  use  the  amount  of  force  that  the 
American  players  put  behind  their  rackets  ;  but  to  compensate  for 
this  it  must  be  admitted  that  they  made  fewer  of  the  returns  land 
in  the  net  or  beyond  the  court  lines. 

When  Larned  played  H.  L.  Doherty  to  his  limit  (and  in  the 
minds  of  the  majority  of  the  spectators  there  is  still  the  question 
as  to  which  is  the  better  man)  Bob  Wrenn  made  a  poor  showing. 
The  former  American  champion  was  not  at  all  at  his  best  on  the 
opening  day  of  the  tournament,  and  as  there  was  a  drizzle  of  rain 
nearly  all  the  time  the  men  were  on  the  courts,  it  was  not  possible 
for  Wrenn  to  play  up  to  his  highest  form,  for  a  wet  court  and  ball 
do  not  assist  the  sort  of  game  at  which  he  may  hope  to  win.  The 
results  of  the  matches  were  as  follows  :

INTERNATIONAL   CHAMPIONSHIP    RECORDS. 

The  Davis  International  Championship  Trophy,  which  represents  the 
world's  championship  at  lawn  tennis,  was  offered  in  1900  hy  D wight 
F.  Davis,  of  St.  Louis,  Mo.,  to  he  held  as  a  perpetual  challenge  cup. 
The  English  Lawn  Tennis  Association  challenged  for  its  possession 
the  first  season  it  was  put  up,  and  sent  a  team  composed  of  A.  W. 
Gore,  E.  D.  Black  and  H.  R.  Barrett,  to  America  in  the  confident  hope 
of  winning  the  new  trophy.  Their  effort  was  a  failure,  for  the  Ameri- 
cans  beat    them    in   every    match    played,    as    shown   by    the   following 

record  :

Barrett    (Great    Britain),    6/4,    6/4,    6/4. 
Result — America   won  by  3  matches  to  0,    10  sets  to  1,   and  76  games  to  50. 

The  Fnglish  Lawn  Tennis  Association  challenged  again  in  1901 
for  the  Davis  Cup  and  all  preparations  were  made  to  meet  the  visi- 
tors, but  at  the  last  minute  they  cabled  over  a  withdrawal  of  the 
challenge,  as  they  were  unable  to  secure  a  representative  team  to  come 
to   America   to   play. 

The  next  series  of  matches  for  the  international  championship  and 
the  Davis  Challenge  Cup  was  held  on  the  grounds  of  the  Crescent 
Athletic  Club,  Bay  Ridge,  New  York,  August  6,  7  and  8,  1902.  The 
result  was  a  victory  for  the  American  defenders  of  the  title  and 
trophy,  but  only  by  the  narrow  margin  of  three  matches'  to  two. 
The  challenging  team  was  composed  of  R.   F.   Doherty,   H.   L.   Doherty

Before  ever  the  Davis  Cup  was  placed  in  competition,  there  were 
a  number  of  unofficial  matches  played.  In  the  eighties.  Dr.  Dwight 
and  R.  D.  Sears,  of  Boston,  then  the  leading  American  players,  spent 
several  seasons  abroad  and  met  the  leading  English  players,  as  also 
did  the  Clark  brothers,  of  Philadelphia,  but  they  were  all  outclassed. 
In  1892,  O.  S.  Campbell,  then  champion  of  America,  played  in  a  num- 
ber of  the  English  tournaments  with  varying  successes,  but  his  de- 
feats far  outnumbered  his  victories,  and  he  was  rated  at  the  end  of 
the  season  well  down  from  the  best  of  the  foreign  players,  although 
still  holding  the  American  championship. 

In  1896,  W.  A.  Larned,  now  the  American  champion,  but  then  rated' 
just  below  the  champion  of  the  year,  made  an  English  campaign  and 
won  more  success  than  any  of  his  predecessors  had  done  before  him. 
At  Wimbledon,  however,  he  was  beaten  for  the  English  championship 


3G  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

by  Herbert  Baddeley,  one  of  the  best  of  the  English  players,  and 
was  rated  several  notches  below  the  best  of  the  English  players  at  the 
end  of  the  year.  Clarence  Hobart  played  abroad  in  1898  and  1899, 
but  did  not  manage  to  earn  a  place  among  the  leaders  abroad,  although 
he  made  a  favorable  showing  in  the  championship  doubles  each  year 
with  H.  A.  Nisbet  for  a  partner. 

Then  came  the  famous  trip  of  D.  F.  Davis  and  Holcomb  Ward  to 
English  courts  in  1901.  Davis  and  Ward  then  held  the  American 
championship  in  doubles,  and  they  confined  their  play  on  the  other 
side  to  the  doubles  games'.  In  this  they  won  every  match  played 
but  two,  their  only  defeats  being  at  the  hands  of  the  Doherty 
brothers,  the  English  champions,  in  an  exhibition  match  two  weeks 
before  the  championship,  and  in  the  challenge  round  for  the  English 
•championship  at  Wimbledon.  In  this'  memorable  encounter,  the  men 
waged  a  drawn  battle  the  first  day,  the  play  being  interrupted  by  rain, 
and  on  the  play-off  the  next  day,  the  Americans  were  beaten  only 
after  a  close  and  exciting  match  by  three  close  sets  to  one. 

A  number  of  foreign  players  entered  American  tournaments  before 
the  Davis  Cup  was  established.  In  1889,  E.  G.  Meers  came  to  America 
and  played  at  Newport,  beating  several  of  our  strong  players,  only  to 
finally  succumb  in  the  semi-final  round  after  five  close  sets  with  O.  S. 
Campbell.  In  1893,  Dr.  J.  Tim  and  H.  S.  Mahony,  two  famous  Irish 
experts  and  both  English  championship  holders,  took  part  in  an  in 
vitation  tournament  at  West  Newton,  Mass.,  against  four  of  the 
strongest  American  players,  R.  D.  Wrenn,  the  championship  holder, 
being  the  only  prominent  absentee  from  the  entry-list.  Pirn  and 
Mahony  won  every  match  but  one,  that  in  which  Clarence  Hobart  beat 
Dr.  Pirn.  In  the  play-off  of  the  tie  that  resulted.  Pim  beat  Mahony 
a  second  time,  and  the  two  visitors  took  first  and  second  honors  be- 
tween them.  An  exhibition  match  in  doubles  was  arranged,  however, 
with  Pim  and  Mahony  against  Hobart  and  Hovey,  the  American 
champions,  and  the  visitors  were  rather  badly  beaten  by  the  Ameri 
cans. 

M.  F.  Goodbody  came  to  America  the  following  season,  1894,  and 
made  a  remarkable  showing  at  Newport.  Goodbody  beat  Hobart, 
Hovey  and  Larned,  the  flower  of  our  home  players',  on  successive  days, 
and  each  in  a  five-set  match,  only  to  finally  fall  a  victim  to  the  clever 
strategy  of  R.  D.  Wrenn  in  the  challenge  round  for  the  American 
•championship. 

In  1897,  a  team  of  three  players.  Dr.  W.  V.  Eaves,  H.  S.  Mahony 
and  H.  A.  Nisbit,  came  unofficially  to  America  to  meet  the  home 
players  in  a  series  of  international  matches.  This  series  was  played 
•at  the  St.  George  Cricket  Club,  in  Hoboken,  and  the  Englishmen 
were  beaten  by  five  matches  to  four  after  a  rather  close  ending.  W.  A. 
Larned,  R.  D.  Wrenn  and  G.  L.  Wrenn,  Jr.,  were  the  Americans  who 
suet  tJbe  visitors  in  this  international   series.

These  were  the  last  international  matches  before  the  Davis  Cup 
-was  established,  and  since  then  the  matches  have  all  been  officially 
sanctioned  and  recognized  as  for  the  World's  Championship.  In  1900, 
the  English  Lawn  Tennis  Association  officially  recognized  the  Davis 
'Cup  as  emblematic  of  the  World's  Championship,  and  a  code  of 
"International  Regulations"  was  drawn  up  and  signed  by  the  officials 
•of  the  two  representative  associations.     This  code  being  as  follows: 

INTERNATIONAL    REGULATIONS    FOR    THE    DAVIS 
TROPHY. 

1.  The  Competition  shall  be  called  "The  Inter-National  Lawn  Tennis 
Championship,"  and  shall  be  open  to  any  nation  which  has  a  recognized

Australia  with  New  Zealand,  Austria,  Belgium,  the  British  Isles 
British  South  Africa,  Canada,  France,  Germany,  Holland,  India,' 
Sweden  and  Norway,  Switzerland,  and  the  United  States  of  America 
shall  be  regarded  as  separate  Nations.  The  Competition  shall  take 
place  in  accordance  with  the  following  Regulations,  and,  except  in 
so  far  as  may  be  agreed  upon  by  the  unanimous  consent  of  the  com- 
peting Nations  for  their  own  Tie,  with  the  Laws  and  Regulations  of 
the  game  for  the  time-being  sanctioned  by  the  Nation  in  whose  Country 
the  Challenge  Tie  shall  from  time  to  time  be  played. 

2.  The  management  of  the  Competition  shall  be  entrusted  to  a 
^Committee  appointed  annually  by  the  Lawn  Tennis  Association  of 
the  Champion  Nation.  When  gate-money  shall  be  taken,  one-half  of 
the  profit  shall  belong  to  the  visiting  Nation;  or  in  the  case  of  a 
Tie  being  played  on  neutral  ground,  one-third  each  to  the  visiting 
Nations. 

3.  For  the  year  1900  the  Challenge  Tie  shall  be  played  in  the 
United  States  of  America,  but  in  subsequent  years  in  the  Country  of 
the  Champion  Nation  at  a  date  and  upon  a  ground  to  be  agreed  upon 
.by  common  consent.  In  the  event  of  an  agreement  not  being  arrived 
.at.  the  fixing  of  the  date  and  ground  shall  be  submitted  to  arbitration. 
Any  Nation  wishing  to  compete  shall  give  notice  to  the  Secretary  of 
the  Lawn  Tennis  Association  of  the  Champion  Nation,  so  that  it  shall 
reach  him  not  later  than  the  first  Monday  in  March  of  the  year  in 
which  the  Competition  is  to  take  place.  Should  more  than  one  Nation 
challenge,  they  shall  compete  among  themselves  for  the  right  to  play 
in  the  Challenge  Tie,  at  a  date  and  upon  a  ground  to  be  agreed  upon  by 
common  consent.  In  the  event  of  an  agreement  not  being  arrived 
at,  the  preliminary  Ties  shall  be  played  in  th©  Country  of  the  Cham- 
pion Nation  at  a  date  and  upon  a  ground  to  be  fixed  upon  by  the 
Committee   of   Management. 

Should  no  Challenge  be  received  by  the  first  Monday  of  March  In 
the  year  in  which  the  Competition  is  to   take  place,   or  if  such  chal- 


38  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

lenge  as  may  be  received  by  that  time  be  withdrawn,  tbe  first  challenge 
received  thereafter  shall  be  a  good  challenge,  provided  it  is  received 
before  the  first  day  of  May  of  said  year. 

4.  A  player  shall  be  qualified  to  represent  a  Nation  if  he  shall 
have  been  born  in  that  Nation,  or  shall  have  resided  therein  for  at 
least  two  years  immediately  preceding  a  Tie,  provided  always  that  he 
be  a  bona  fide  Amateur  ;  but  no  one  shall  be  entitled  to  play  for  more 
than  one  Nation  in  this  Competition  during  the  same  year.  During; 
the  time  that  a  player  may  be  qualifying  to  play  for  a  Nation  under 
the  residental  qualification,  he  may  play  for  the  Nation  for  which  he 
shall  have  last  previously  been  qualified. 

5.  A  Referee  shall  be  appointed  by  common  consent  of  the  com- 
peting Sides.  He  shall  have  power  to  appoint  Umpires,  and  shall 
decide  any  point  of  law  which  an  Umpire  may  profess  himself  unable 
to  decide,  or  which  may  be  referred  to  him  on  appeal  from  the 
decision  of  an  Umpire  by  the  players.  He  shall  decide,  if  he  be 
called  upon  to  decide  by  the  Captain  of  either  side,  whether  or  not 
a  Match  or  Matches  shall  be  stopped  owing  to  the  state  of  the 
courts,  the  state  of  the  weather,  darkness  or  other  unavoidable  hin- 
drance. 

6.  The  players  shall  be  chosen  in  the  Single  and  Double  Contests 
by  their  respective  Captains  from  not  more  than  four  players  nomin- 
ated by  the  Lawn  Tennis  Associations  of  the  competing  Nations. 
Notice  of  such  nomination  shall  be  sent  to  the  Secretary  of  the 
Lawn  Tennis  Association  of  the  opposing  Nation  not  less  than 
twenty-one  days  previous  to  the  date  of  commencement  of  a  Tie, 
and  in  such  a  way  that  it  shall  reach  him  not  less  than  seven  days. 
before  the  commencement  of  play.  Should  four  (4)  players  be 
nominated,  it  shall  at  the  came  time  be  stated  which  are  to  take 
part  in  the  Singles  and  which  in  the  Doubles.  Each  Tie  shall  be 
decided  by  the  combined  results  of  Singles  and  Doubles,  and  the  Side 
which  shall  win  the  majority  of  Matches  shall  be  the  winner  of 
a  Tie. 

7.  The  time  of  cessation  cf  play  shall  be  fixed  before  the  com- 
mencement or  each  day's  play  by  the  Captains  of  the  opposing  Sides, 
or  by  the  Referee  if  they  shall  disagree.  It  shall  be  the  duty  of  the 
Referee  to  stop  play  when  this  time  arrives  ;  provided,  nevertheless, 
that  he  may  extend  the  time  with  the  consent  of  the  Captains  of 
the  opposing  Sides.  A  player  shall  not  be  called  upon  to  play  more 
than  one  Match  a  day  except  with  the  unanimous  consent  of  the 
Captains  of  the  opposing  Sides  and   the  Committee  of  Management. 

8.  In  the  Singles  each  Team  shall  consist  of  two  players  who  shall 
play  each  against  each  of  the  opposing  Team  the  best  of  five  advan- 
tage sets.     The  order  of  play  shall  be  decided  by  lot. 

9.  In  the  Doubles,  each  Team  shall  consist  of  two  players,  who 
shall  play  against  the  opposing  Team  the  best  of  five  advantage 
sets. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  39 

10.  In  Singles  and  Doubles,  notice  of  the  Teams  chosen  shall  be 
given  to  the  Captain  of  the  opposing  side  not  less'  than  twelve  hours 
before  the  time  fixed  for  the  commencement  of  play  in  each  Contest. 
The  order  of  play,  as  regards  Singles  and  Doubles,  shall  be  decided 
by  the  Committee  of  Management  and  announced  not  less  than 
twenty-four   (24)  hours  before  such  notice  is  due. 

11.  If  any  player  be  absent  when  called  upon  to  play  by  the 
Referee,  the  opposing  side  shall  be  entitled  to  three  love  sets. 

Should,  however,  a  player  be  incapacitated  by  illness,  proved  to 
the  satisfaction  of  the  Referee,  another  member  of  the  team  can  be 
substituted,  provided  the  Captain  of  the  other  team  gives  his  consent. 

12.  The  above  Regulations  shall  be  binding  upon  the  Nations  con- 
cerned, and  shall  not  be  altered  except  with  the  consent  of  two-thirds 
of  the  Association  whose  Nations  shall  have  from  time  to  time  com- 
peted and  who  shall  record  their  votes. 

Note. — In  the  above  Regulations,  one  Nation  playing  against  an- 
other is  regarded  as  a  "Tie  ;"  Singles  and  Doubles  are  regarded 
as  separate  "Contests  ;"  and  the  best  of  five  advan;  .ge  sets  is 
regarded  as  a  "Match."  The  players  in  Singles  and  Doubles  are 
regarded  as  separate  "Teams,"  and  the  players  in  the  combined 
Contests  as  a  "Side." 


The  captain  of  the  British  Isles  team  arrived  at  Queenstown  on 
Saturday,  August  22,  and  had  the  following  interview  with  a  cor- 
respondent : 

"Well,  I  suppose  you  want  to  know  about  the  substitution  episode. 
The  question's  rather  complicated. 

"Regulations  8  and  11   read  as  follows: 

"  '8.  In  the  singles,  each  team  shall  consist  of  two  players,  who 
shall  play  each  against  each  of  the  opposing  team  the  best  of  five 
advantage  sets. 

"  '11.  If  any  player  be  absent  when  called  upon  to  play  by  the 
referee,  the  opposing  side  shall  be  entitled  to  three  love  sets.  Should, 
however,  a  player  be  incapacitated  by  illness,  proved  to  the  satisfaction 
of  the  referee,  another  member  of  the  side  can  be  substituted,  pro- 
vided the  captain  of  the  other  side  gives  his  consent.' 

"Taking  11  in  conjunction  with  8,  Mr.  Larned  considered  that  if 
Mr.  Mahony  took  R.  F.'s  place  in  the  first  round  of  the  singles,  In 
must  take  it  also  in  the  second.  In  fact,  that  not  more  than  two 
players  can  represent  a  nation  in  the  singles.  Those  who  take  the 
opposite  view  ask,  'How  would  matters  stand  if  a  player  were  in- 
capacitated on  the  day  of  the  second  round  ?'  If  the  captain  gave 
his  consent  to  substitution,  then  three  players  would  be  called  upon. 
Anyhow.  Mr.  Larned  was  put  in  a  tight  corner,  and,  interpreting  the 
regulation  as  he  did,   it  is  hard  to  blame  him.      What  should  I  have 


40  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

done  in  the  same  position?  Well,  you  see,  I  know  why  the  regulation 
was  framed,  and  should  have  acted  without  fear  of  criticism  from 
press  or  anyone.  Luckily  I  was  not  placed  in  his  fix.  You  must  remem- 
ber this,  Mr.  Larned  gave  us  every  other  right  of  substitution,  both 
in  singles  and  doubles.  We  must  give  him  the  credit  of  being  generous 
within  his  limitations.  We  must  have  the  regulations  altere< 
to  avoid  misinterpretations.  It's  all  over  now.  There  is  no  ill  feel- 
ing. The  two  teams  and  the  committee  dined  together  after  the 
match,  and  were  as  merry  as  sandboys'. 

"  'What  was  the  real  trouble  with  Mr.  R.  F.  Doherty  ?' 
"This  is  an  extract  from  Dr.  Whipple's  certificate :  "This  is  to 
certify  that  Mr.  R.  F.  Doherty  is  suffering  from  a  strain  of  the 
deltoid  muscle  of  right  shoulder,  and  probably  of  capsular  ligament. 
But,  as  he  jokingly  remarked,  the  trouble  was  difficult  to  locate,  and  it 
was  hardly  worth  while  cutting  the  arm  open  to  make  sure.  Luckily^ 
we  had  two  days  of  real  English  weather,  and  the  best  possible  medical 
help.  If  there  had  been  no  rain,  I  do  not  think  R.  F.  could  have 
played  in  the  doubles  on  Wednesday,  though  quite  possibly  he  could 
have  played  in  the  second  round  of  the  singles  on  Thursday. 

"  'What  chance  do  you  think  we  should  have  had  with  Mr.  Mahony 
in  Mr.  Doherty's  place?'  I  think  Mr.  Larned  would  have  beaten  him. 
With  regard  to  the  other  two  matches,  Mr.  Mahony  got  within  a 
stroke  of  beating  Mr.  R.  D.  Wrenn  in  the  three  jbet  match  at 
Nahant,  and  with  R.  F.  beat  the  brothers  Wrenn  3/2.  With  II.  L. 
as  partner  instead  of  R.  F.,  Mr.  Mahony  would  have  been  in  his 
proper  court ;  so  there  was  always  more  than  'half  a  ghost  of  a  dog's 
chance,'  as  one  of  the  team  would  say,  even  without  R.  F." 

"This  is  the  official  score  : 

"H.  L.  Doherty  beat  R.  D.  Wrenn,  6/0,  6/3,  6/4. 
"W.  A.  Larned  beat  R.  F.  Doherty,  6/0,  6/0,  6/0,  by  default. 
"R.    F.    Doherty    and   H.    L.    Doherty   beat    R.    D.    Wrenn    and   G.    L. 
Wrrenn,  7/5,  7/5,  2/6,  6/3. 

"R.  F.  Doherty  beat  R.  D.  WTrenn,  6/4,  3/6,  6/3,  6/8,  6/4. 
"H.  L.  Doherty  beat  W.  A.  Larned,  6/3,  6/8,  6/0,  2/6,  7/5. 

"The  British  Isles  team  beat  America  by  4  matches'  to  1,  12  sets  to- 
8  and  94  games  to  91.  It  may  be  of  interest  to  your  readers  that  in 
the  matches  actually  played  the  British  Isles  team  scored  562  strokes 
to  their  opponents'  511.  In  my  official  report  there  is  a  table  showing 
in  what  way  the  strokes  were  won  and  lost. 

"  'How  did  the  courts  compare  with  those  at  Bay  Ridge  last  year, 
or,  say,  Wimbledon?'  Better  than  Wimbledon,  and  as  good  as  Bay 
Ridge,  which  is  equivalent  to  saying  that  they  were  perfect.  Chambers, 
the  groundman,  is  an  old  Notts  cricketer,  and  thoroughly  understands 
his  business.  The  light  was  good,  there  was  heaps  of  room  round  the 
courts,   and  everything  was  done  by   the  committee  to   make  the   con- 


SrALDINGS    LAWN    TENNIS     ANNUAL.  41 

ditions  ideal.  The  applause  at  times  was  almost  deafening,  and, 
aiatu rally  enough,  more  for  the  home  side  than  for  us.  Nevertheless, 
when  the  last  stroke  of  Mr.  H.  L.  Doherty's  match  was  played,  a  roar 
of  congratulation  went  un  from  all  sides,  and  we  felt  that,  keen  as  the 
Americans  were  for  their  side  to  win,  they  did  not  grudge  us  victory 
when  it  was  ours.  Yes,  the  team  was  in  strict  training  all  the  time. 
When  it  was  not  beef  and  chicken,  it  was  chicken  and  beef,  and, 
as  the  funny  man  of  the  team  remarked  at  the  end  of  the  time,  he 
could  not  look  a  cow  or  a  hen  in  the  face  without  blushing. 

"  'How  was  Mr.  Mahoney  playing?'  Quite  well.  The  lawn  tennis' 
world  owes  him  a  debt  of  gratitude  for  his  sportsmanlike  conduct  in 
crossing  the  ocean  simply  on  tue  off-chance  of  being  wanted.  You 
can  imagine  what  our  anxiety  would  have  been  if  we  had  not  had  him 
with  us." 

"Do  you  expect  a  team  over  next  year?" 

"Oh,  sure  ;  if  they're  in  their  present  mood.  They  have  plenty  to 
pick  from.  Messrs.  Larned,  Whitman,  Wright,  Clothier,  Ward,  Davis, 
R.  D.  and  G.  L.  Wrenn,  Ware  and  Leonard,  not  to  mention  another 
Larned,  who  might  be  dangerous  with  his  brother  in  the  doubles." 

"No  ;  I  have  nothing  more  to  say.  My  official  report  is  painfully 
full  of  detail." 


42  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


SECTIONAL  CHAMPIONSHIPS 


THE    EASTERN    DOUBLES   CHAMPIONSHIP. 

The  Longwood  Cricket  Club's  open  tournament,  on  their  courts  at 
Boston,  Mass.,  and  the  playing  of  the  Eastern  doubles  championship, 
gained  in  special  importance  because  of  its'  being,  in  a  measure,  a 
preliminary  to  the  International  meeting  for  the  Dwight  F.  Davis 
challenge  cup.  While  this  was  in  the  singles,  the  doubles  also  ranked 
but  slightly  second  in  importance,  because  it  meant  the  selection  of 
the  team  which  would  probably  be  called  upon  to  challenge  the 
Doherty  brothers  of  England  for  the  American  title  that  they  had  won 
at  Newport  the  previous  season.  With  the  knowledge  that  the  singles 
were  to  be  in  the  nature  of  preparatory  work  for  at  least  one  of  the 
international  team,  the  list  of  entries  for  this  event  showed  remarkable 
strength.  Playing  from  the  first  round,  William  A.  Larned  came 
through  to  the  finals,  in  which  he  defeated  Holcomb  Ward  and  then 
challenged  William  J.  Clothier,  the  holder  of  the  title.  Larned,  who 
had  a  season  before  succumbed  to  Clothier's  brilliancy  of  play,  turned 
the  tables  upon  the  young  Pennsylvanian,  and  defeated  him  three  sets. 
to  one.  In  fact,  that  Clother  was  able  to  get  a  set  at  first  seemed 
more  in  the  nature  of  an  accident,  for  as  soon  as  Larned  began  to 
play  his  game,  he  found  little  difficulty  in  regaining  his  trophy.  In 
fact,  Larned  had  more  trouble  with  Ward  in  the  final  rounds  than 
he  did  with  Clothier  in  the  challenge  match,  as  Ward  forced  the 
contest  through  the  entire  five  sets,  two  of  the  sets  going  to  deuce. 
Among  the  others  who  took  part  in  the  singles  were  Alfred  Codman, 
E.  P.  Larned,  Irving  C.  Wright,  Robert  Leroy,  Harry  F.  Allen,  George 
L.  Wrenn  and  Robert  D.  Wrenn.  The  Wrenn  brothers  won  their  way 
through  to  the  fourth  round,  in  which  George  Wrenn  defeated  nis 
redoubtable  brother  Bob  in  four  sets,  but  in  the  semi-finals  William 
A.  Larned  defeated  George  Wrenn  in  four  sets,  in  all  of  which  the 
score  was  close. 

Holcomb  Ward  and  Leonard  E.  Ware,  two  of  Harvard's  veteran 
players,  won  their  way  through  the  Eastern  doubles  tournament,  ex- 
hibiting the  best  doubles  tennis  that  was  seen  last  year  on  the 
American  courts.  Both  men  played  smoothly  together  with  such 
skill  as  to  raise  great  hopes  of  what  they  might  accomplish  at  New- 
port. Had  their  showing  on  the  Casino  courts  been  anything  like  their 
display  of  tennis  at  Longwood  the  annals  of  the  game  for  the  season 
of  1903  would  probably  tell  a  different  story.  There  was  no  lack 
of    splendid   material    in    the    Eastern    doubles,    for    in   the   semi-finals 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  43 

Ward  and  Ware  met  the  younger  Harvard  team,  composed  of  Edgar 
Leonard  and  Irving  C.  Wright.  It  was  this  younger  team  that  in 
the  second  round  had  disposed  of  the  indoor  champions',  Wylie  C. 
•Grant  and  Robert  Leroy.  The  Wrenn  brothers  also  began  the  tourna- 
ment, but  their  hopes  of  coming  through  were  dashed  by  William  A. 
Larned  and  Beals  C.  Wright  in  the  first  round,  in  which  the  Wrenns 
were  defeated  in  five  sets  by  the  score  of  8/6,  8/6,  3/6,  6/8,  6/4. 
This  proved  a  somewhat  sensational  feature  of  the  tournament,  as 
the  Wrenns  were  getting  ready  for  the  international  matches.  The

WESTERN    CHAMPIONSHIP   TOURNAMENT. 

The  annual  tournament  for  championship  of  men's  singles  and 
doubles,  women's  singles  and  doubles,  and  mixed  doubles  was  held  on 
the  turf  courts  of  the  Kenwood  Country  Club,  Chicago,  during  the  week 
commencing  July  25.  The  holding  of  the  men  and  women's  tournament 
during  the  same  week  proved  a  great  success  and  was  pronounced  the 
most  interesting  event  ever  held  at  Chicago. 

In  the  men's  singles  there  were  sixty-eight  entries,  including  players 
from  Canada,  Minneapolis,  Cincinnati,  Milwaukee,  South  Dakota  and 
from  other  sections  about  Chicago. 

A.  C.  Snow,  of  Chicago,  worked  his  way  to  finals,  defeating  such  men 
as  Paterson,  of  Canada,  and  Nat  Emerson,  of  Cincinnati.  Waidner  had 
easy  sailing  up  to  the  fourth  round,  when  he  met  and  defeated  Burton, 
of  Minneapolis,  and  Reuben  Hunt,  of  California  ;  both  in  straight  sets. 
The  finals  between  Snow  and  Waidner  was  won  by  Snow,  who  played  in 
remarkable  form,  his  volleying  and  network  being  the  great  feature  of 
his  game. 

The  championship  match  between  Kriegh  Collins  and  Snow  was  won 
by  the  former,  giving  him  three  legs  on  the  A.  G.  Spalding  championship 
bowl,  and  permanent  possession  of  it,  and  demonstrating  his  premier- 
ship in  the  West. 

The  doubles  which  are  always  the  most  important  event,  owing  to 
its  being  a  part  of  the  national  double  championship,  was  very  well 
contested.  Collins  and  Waidner  and  Emerson  and  Diehl,  however,  out- 
classed their  opponents  and  met  in  the  finals. 

The  match  was  a  brilliant  one,  resulting  in  a  straight  set  victory  for 
Collins  and  Waidner. 

In  the  ladies'  singles  with  such  entries  as  Misses  Neeley,  Closterman, 
Pound,  Parker,  Summerhayes  and  Hedley,  good  tennis  was  the  only 
natural  result.  After  many  hard  fought  matches,  Miss  Clostermann 
survived  as  the  winner  of  the  tournament  and  challenger  for  the  cham- 
pionship held  by  Miss  Myrtle  McAteer.  The  dashing  game  of  the 
champion,  however,  was  too  much  for  the  ever-steady  game  of  her 
opponent  and  for  the  third  time  Miss  McAteer  bears  the  title  of  West- 
ern Champion.     Score  :  8/6,  6/1.

MIDDLE    STATES    CHAMPIONSHIP    TOURNAMENT. 

The  Middle  States  championship  tournament  on  the  courts  of  the 
Orange  Lawn  Tennis  Club,  at  Mountain  Station,  N.  J.,  occupied  the 
week  of  June  29,  and  drew  more  than  the  usual  fine  and  strong  list 
of  entries.  The  women's  singles  proved  to  be  especially  noteworthy, 
with  eleven  of  the  foremost  players  of  the  country  in  the  event.  The 
men's  singles,  so  far  as  the  challenge  round  was  concerned,  were 
not  finished,  as  rain  prevented  the  playing  of  the  championship  match 
at  the  time,  and  rather  than  play  late  in  the  season,  when  he 
was  stale  from  too  much  training,  Holcomb  Ward  defaulted  to  Stephen 
C.  Millett.  Millett,  the  new  champion,  earned  his  title,  however, 
for  the  men's  singles  were  well  contested.  In  the  semi-final  round 
Millett  met  Theodore  Roosevelt  Pell,  Jr.,  a  relative  of  the  President, 
while  Robert  Leroy,  the  Columbia  University  player,  came  through 
by  defeating  C.  F.  Watson.  Leroy  was  hardly  a  match  for  a  veteran 
of  Millett's  calibre  and  lost  the  final  in  straight  sets  by  an  easy 
score.  The  feature  of  the  men's  doubles  was  the  fact  that  the  Wrenn 
brothers,  Ward  and  Ware  and  the  indoor  champions,  Grant  and 
Leroy,  were  entered.  To  the  surprise  of  the  followers  of  the  tourna- 
ment, the  Wrenn  brothers  defeated  Ward  and  Ware  in  the  final 
contest  for  the  championship.  Grant  and  Leroy  were  successful  in 
working  up  to  the  semi-final  round,  where  they  met  the  Wrenns.  The 
latter  were  too  strong-  at  every  point  for  Grant  and  Leroy.  and  they 
were  beaten  in  two  sets.     Miss  Neely  of  Chicago  won  the  title  in  the 


50  SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

women's   singles.      She  met  the  former   holder,   Miss   Marion   Jones,   in 

the  final   round,   defeating  her  by  two  sets  to  one.      In  the  semi-finals 

of    this   event,    Miss    Jones   defeated    Mrs.    Chapman    and    Miss    ISeely 

defeated    Miss    Helen    Homans    of    the    West    Side    Tennis    Club,    New

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  51 

SOUTHERN    CHAMPIONSHIP. 

The  Southern  championship,  always  regarded  as  the  opening  event 
of  the  season,  brought  out  a  most  excellent  field  of  Eastern  and 
Southern  players  on  the  courts  of  the  Bachelors  Tennis  Club,  Wash- 
ington, D.  C.  It  resulted,  so  far  as  the  singles  were  concerned,  in 
returning  the  championship  title  to  a  Southerner,  as  Geoghegan,  a 
member  of  the  Bachelors  Club,  successfully  played  his'  way  through 
to  the  final  round,  in  which  he  defeated  Wylie  C.  Grant,  the  New 
Yorker,  after  four  exciting  sets.  Previous  to  the  finals,  Geoghegan 
met  the  old-time  champion  and  holder  of  the  title,  John  Davidson, 
in  the  semi-finals  and  won  with  comparative  ease.  The  Washington 
player  had  displayed  such  great  ability  throughout  the  rounds  of  the 
tournament  that  when  he  faced  Raymond  D.  Little,  the  holder  of  the 
title,  in  the  challenge  match  he  was  the  favorite.  Little  hardly 
played  up  to  his  usual  form,  but  even  had  he  done  so  it  is  doubtful 
If  he  would  have  been  able  to  successfully  defend  his  holding  of 
the  cup,  for  Geoghegan  could  have  extended  himself  much  more 
than  he  did.     As  it  was,  he  defeated  the  champion  by  three  sets  to  one. 

Some  of  the  best  play  of  the  tournament  was  shown  in  the  doubles 
event,  which  was  won  by  Wylie  C.  Grant  and  Robert  Leroy,  the 
national  indoor  champions  of  New  York,  who  defeated  the  Southern 
pair,  John  C.  Davidson  and  Dr.  Glazebrook,  in  a  close  four  set  match. 
Grant  and  Leroy  played  their  way  with  consummate  skill  from  the 
preliminary  round,  in  which  they  defeated  the  West  Side  Tennis 
Club  team,  Raymond  D.  Little  and  C.  C.  Kelly.  Their  play  was 
distinguished  by  the  hard  hitting  of  Grant,  whose  strokes  were  espe- 
cially suited  to  the  hard  surface  of  the  Washington  court.  Leroy's 
passing  strokes  were  brilliantly  executed,  and  with  great  timeliness 
in  the  final  match,  as  the  £  iiithern  pair  pressed  them  closely  through- 
out this  contest. 

A  pleasing  feature  of  the  tournament  was  the  appearance  of 
William  A.  Larned,  the  national  champion  in  the  singles,  who  came 
from  Annapolis  to  get  some  early  practice  among  the  players  entered 
in  the  tournament.  Larned  at  that  early  period  of  the  season  dis- 
played rare  form  in  his  preliminary  work  for  the  international  tourna- 
ment which  was  to  follow.     The  summaries  :

54  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

NORTHWESTERN    CHAMPIONSHIP  TOURNAMENT. 

One  of  the  most  beautiful  spots  in  the  Northwest  is  Lake  Minne- 
tonka,  Minnesota,  where  the  annual  tournament  of  the  championship 
of  the  Northwest  has  been  held  for  the  last  fifteen  years',  to  which  all 
the  players  flock  each  year.  The  tournament  has  long  been  the  great 
social  event  of  the  season  about  the  lake.  Aside  from  the  tennis,  sail- 
ing, canoeing,  dancing,  golfing,  and  fishing  acts  as  a  magnet  in  drawing 
a  large  number  of  the  leading  players  each  year  for  the  championship 
event.  The  four  beautiful  turf  courts  are  in  the  centre  of  a  natural 
amphi-theatre,  with  a  quaint  little  chalet  overlooking  the  courts. 

The  most  important  matches  were  those  in  which  Reuben  Hunt  de- 
feated George  K.  Eelden,  and  the  Hunt-Waidner  match  which  resulted 
in  a  victory  for  Waidner.  Snow  and  Harry  Belden  played  a  brilliant 
match,  Snow  being  the  victor.  This  brought  A.  C.  Snow  and  L.  H. 
Waidner  together  in  the  finals.  These  players  met  the  previous  week 
in  the  finals  in  the  Western  championship,  where  Snow  was  the  victor. 
Waidner,  however,  seemed  to  be  at  the  top  of  his  game  at  Minnetonka 
and  defeated  Snow  in  straight  sets.     Score  :  6/3,  6/4,  6/3. 

In  the  doubles  Belden  Brothers  and  Snow  and  Hunt  met  In  the 
finals  and  after  a  hard  five-set  match,  replete  with  many  brilliant 
strokes,  the  Belden  Brothers  won.      Score  :  4/6,  7/5,  6/3,  2/6,  6/4.

METROPOLITAN    CHAMPIONSHIP    TOURNAMENT. 

The  playing  of  the  Metropolitan  championship  tournament  on  the 
courts  of  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club  at  One  Hundred  and  Seventeenth 
Street  and  Amsterdam  Avenue,  New  York  City,  was  greatly  marred 
by  almost  continuous  rain  during  the  opening  days  of  the  meeting. 
The  victory  of  Holcomb  Ward,  the  Harvard  veteran,  in  the  challenge 
match  was  distinctly  according  to  form,  however,  and  the  contest 
was  played  under  faultless  conditions.  Ward  defeated  Harold  H. 
Hackett,  the  former  Yale  champion,  and  took  the  Metropolitan  trophy 
in  five  sets  of  the  best  tennis  that  has  ever  been  witnessed  in  this 
event.  While  Ward  appeared  to  be  erratic  at  times  during  the  com- 
petition, he  saved  himself  from  defeat  by  his  resourcefulness  at  the 
critical  periods.  He  was  extremely  weak  on  his  attacking  game  and 
had  not  Hackett  shown  such  unmistakable  signs  of  fatigue  at  the  close 
he  might  have  been  able  to  have  defended  his  title  to  the  champion- 
ship with  some  hope  of  success.  Among  the  others  who  played 
through  the  singles  were  Ross  Burchard,  Frederick  G.  Anderson, 
Harry  F.  Allen,  C.  M.  Relyea  of  the  New  York  Athletic  Club,  L.  E. 
Mahan  of  Columbia  University  and  O.  M.  Bostwick. 

The  fortunes  of  the  game  brought  two  scratch  teams  into  the  final 
round  of  the  championship  doubles,  which  resulted  in  a  victory  for 
Harry  F.  Allen  of  the  Belmont  Cricket  Club,  Philadelphia,  and  Robert 
Leroy,  the  Columbia  University  player.  This  pair  defeated  Holcomb 
Ward  and  Ross  Burgin  in  four  sets.  Allen  and  Eeroy  seemed  to  have 
had  the  most  difficult  section  of  the  draw  throughout  the  doubles',  but 
the  spirited  play  at  the  net  on  the  part  of  Allen  was  so  well  suited 
to  the  admirable  back  court  work  of  Leroy  that  the  pair  were  able  to 
win  their  matches  in  regular  order.     The  summaries  :

MIDDLE    WEST    CHAMPIONSHIP    AT    OMAHA. 

The  Omaha  Tournament,  heretofore  known  as  the  Tri-State  Tourna- 
ment, now  carries  with  it  the  Middle  West  championship.  The  hand- 
some new  club  house  and  grounds  of  the  Omaha  Field  Club,  under  whose 
auspices  the  event  is  now  given,  was  pronounced  by  everybody  a  grand 
success.  The  large  number  of  entries,  representing  various  sections, 
added  much   to   the   interest  of  the   tournament. 

R.  G.  Hunt,  of  California,  and  Frank  Eberhart,  of  Salina,  Kansas, 
had  things  very  much  their  own  way  to  the  final.  Hunt  was  looked 
upon  as  a  s  u-e  winner  of  the  singles,  but  Eberhart  started  out  at  a 
very  rapid  pace,  which  he  kept  up  throughout  the  match  and  won  in 
straight  sets.  In  the  challenge  match  against  F.  R.  Sanderson,  Eber- 
hardt  again  demonstrated  great  skill,  and  won  the  championship  after 
a  hard  match. 

In  the  doubles,  Holland  and  Sanderson  won  the  tournament  and  had 
little  difficulty  in  defeating  Farnsworth  and  Raymond,  holders  of  the 
championship.      The   scores' :

STATE  CHAMPIONSHIP  TOURNAMENTS 


WISCONSIN    CHAMPIONSHIP   TOURNAMENT. 

The  Wisconsin  Slate  Lawn  Tennis  Tour- 
nament, held  August  18,  on  the  courts  of 
the  Town  Club  in  Milwaukee,  brought 
out  by  far  the  best  tennis  ever  seen  in 
Wisconsin,  and  was  fully  up  to  the  stand- 
ard of  other  Western  tournaments.  The 
new  Town  Club  proved  a  most  attractive 
place  for  tournament  work,  both  for 
players  and  spectators.  The  courts  were 
in  perfect  condition,  and  the  long,  broad 
porch,  overlooking  the  courts  and  shaded 
by  the  club  house,  made  an  ideal  place  to 
watch  the  play.  The  only  unfortunate 
feature  was  the  rain,  which  delayed  the 
final  matches  over  into  the  second  week. 
Of  the  players,  Reuben  G.  Hunt,  of 
California,  was  easily  the  star.  He  was 
playing  his  best  game  and  disposed  of 
his  opponents  down  to  finals  with  greatest 
ease.  In  fact,  no  one  got  more  than  two 
games  to  the  match  against  him  until 
finals,  when  he  met  John  E.  Roche,  of 
Kenwood.  Roche  had  played  splendid 
tennis  at  intervals  all  through  the  tour- 
nament, although  he  had  narrow  escapes 
from  Lamed,  his  partner  in  doubles,  and 
from  Forstall,  who  was  at  one  time  with- 
in a  point  of  the  match  in  semi-finals. 
The  finals  between  Hunt  and  Roche  was  most  interesting.  Hunt 
was  steadier  and  his  victory  was  in  a  measure  due  to  Roche's  slam- 
ming and  streaks  of  wildness.  When  Roche  did  get  his  drives  in,  how- 
ever, they  were  almost  conclusive.  Perhaps  the  most  spectacular  fea- 
ture of  the  match,  and,  in  fact,  of  the  whole  tournament,  was  Hunt's 
handling  of  lobs,  which  he  placed  with  speed  and  persistent  accuracy 
into  the  back  corners  of  his  opponent's  court. 

The  challenge  match  was  not  particularly  interesting.  Hunt  won 
in  straight  sets  against  McMynn,  who  was  apparently  playing  against 
the  conviction  that  he  would  be  beaten.  He  put  up  a  strong  fight, 
however,  and  got  the  same  number  of  games  as  Roche. 


R.  G.  HUNT 

Wisconsin  State  Champion  in 

Singles 


72  SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNDAL. 

In  doubles.  Hunt  and  Helmholz  and  Roche  and  Larned  played  easily 
into  finals.  Finals,  however,  proved  a  very  difl&cult  match,  taking 
five  long  sets  before  Roche  and  Larned,  of  Chicago  finally  won. 

In  the  challenge  match,  Roche  and  Larned  won  from  Jones  and 
Lightner  with  comparative  ease. 

Bryon  Paine  won  the  consolation  singles  from  T.  H.  Spence. 
Later  in  the  season  a  ladies'  tournament  was  held,  which,  though 
rather  small  in  point  of  entries,  was  exceedingly  interesting.  Miss 
Carrie  Neely  won  the  tournament  quite  handily,  beating  Miss  Steever 
in  finals  and  in  the  challenge  match  completely  outplaying  Miss  Par- 
ker, who  did  not  play  nearly  the  game  she  played  in  1902. 

In  doubles  Miss  Parker  and  Miss  Neely  won,  and  in  mixed  doubles 
Miss  Parker  and  Mr.  Hunt.     The  scores :

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  73 

THE    ILLINOIS  STATE   CHAMPIONSHIP. 

The  first  annual  tournament  for  the  Illinois  State  Championship 
was  held  on  the  turf  courts  of  the  Aztec  Tennis  Club  of  Chicago,  on 
June  27  and  following  days. 

The  event  was'  made  unusually  interesting  this  year  by  the  large 
list  of  prominent  players  it  attracted.  Interest  centered  mainly  in  the 
work  of  Collins  and  Waidner,  the  Western  champions,  who  showed 
their  first  glimpse  of  the  form  they  displayed  later  on  in  the  season 
and  who  ran  throught  the  tournament  without  losing  a  set,  until  the 
final  round  was  reached. 

The  brilliant  playing  of  Arthur  C.  Snow,  the  winner  of  the  Western 
Tournament,  and  Reuben  G.  Hunt,  the  holder  of  the  Gulf  States  and 
many  other  championships,  was  watched  with  interest.  Of  the  other 
contestants,  E.  M.  Ashcraft,  J.  C.  Neely,  Cy.  Garnett,  Evers  Morley, 
Blair  Lamed,  and  Butler  Lamb,  were  the  more  prominent. 

The  final  match  in  doubles  proved  very  interesting  throughout,  owing 
to  the  brilliancy  of  Snow  and  Ashcratt,  who  held  their  veteran  oppon- 
ents, Collins  and  Waidner,  close  in  a  long  five-set  match. 

The  finals  in  singles,  unfortunately,  was  never  played,  an  inoppor- 
tune rain  and  an  engagement  of  Mr.  Hunt's  in  the  East  necessitating 
a  default  of  the  title  to  A.  C.  Snow. 

The  consolation  singles  was  won  by  E.  L.  Morley  and  the  doubles 
by  Morley  and  Helmholz.      The  scores  :

Massachusetts  State  Champion 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  79 

THE    MASSACHUSETTS    STATE    CHAMPIONSHIP. 

The  tournament  for  the  Massachusetts  State  championship  in 
singles  was  held,  as  in  former  years,  by  the  Longwood  Cricket  Club 
of  Boston,  during  the  week  following  June  17,  while  the  State  cham- 
pionship tournament  in  doubles  was  held  in  connection  with  the  open 
tournament  at  Magnolia  Beach  Lawn  Tennis  Club.  In  the  singles, 
Kenneth  Horton  and  B.  C.  Seaver  came  together  in  the  final  round. 
Seaver  developed  such  tremendous  speed  in  the  opening  set  that  it 
appeared  as  if  he  would  have  a  walkover.  In  the  scond  set,  how- 
ever, Horton's  tactics  were  successful  in  stopping  the  career  of 
Seaver,  and  although  the  score  was  very  close  Horton  won  the  match. 
Horton  then  faced  Beals  C.  Wright,  the  holder  of  the  championship 
title,  in  the  challenge  contest.  Wright  was  at  every  point  superior 
to  the  challenging  player  and  was  able  to  retain  his  right  to  the 
championship  without  the  loss  of  a  set.  The  playing  of  Seaver  was 
the  one  sensational  feature  of  the  meeting,  as  he  was  able  to  defeat 
William  J.  Clothier,  the  Philadelphian,  in  the  semi-final  round,  with 
the  score  at  two  sets  to  one.  All  of  the  matches  of  the  tournament 
were  well  contested,  although  the  entry  list  was  not  as  strong  numeri- 
cally as  in  former  seasons.     The  scores  :

score  in  all  of  the  three  sets  touched  deuce  at  7/5,  7/5,  8/6.  Budlong 
played  with  that  remarkable  show  of  persistent  and  steady  work

INVITATION   TOURNAMENTS 


THE   SOUTHAMPTON   TOURNAMENT. 

The  presence  of  the  English  tennis  team  fresh  from  their  triumphs 
as  winners  of  the  Dwight  F.  Davis  International  Challenge  Bowl  en- 
livened the  play  at  the  invitation  tournament  on  the  courts  of  the 
Meadow  Club  at  Southampton,  Long  Island,  which  held  the  courts  the 
week  of  August  11.  In  the  singles  H.  L.  Doherty  defeated  William  A. 
Larned  in  the  finals  in  three  straight  sets.  The  doubles  also  proved  an 
easy  victory  for  the  formidable  Doherty  brothers,  as  there  was  no 
pair  that  approaches  them  in  point  of  skill,  and  in  the  finals  they  dis- 
tinctly outclassed  William  A.  Larned  and  Beals  C.  Wright,  winning 
a  three-set  victory.  The  elder  brother,  R.  F.  Doherty,  entered  the 
singles,  but  defaulted  his  first  match  to  Arthur  Torrence.  The  veteran 
English  expert,  Harold  Mahony,  narrowly  missed  defeat  in  his  first 
match  at  the  hands  of  H.  H.  Whitman,  the  brother  of  Malcolm  Whit- 
man. Mahony's  next  opponent  was  William  J.  Clothier,  whose  work 
was  the  one  brilliant  bit  on  the  American  side,  and  Clothier  won  over 
Mahony  by  two  sets  to  one,  only  to  be  beaten  in  the  semi-finals  by 
H.  L.  Doherty  in  a  setless  match.  As  in  former  years,  the  entry  list 
was  composed  of  a  sprinkling  of  veterans,  several  of  whom  had  held 
the  national  title,  and  a  number  of  the  collegians  who  were  winning 
their  spurs.

Miller  brothers,  of  the  Roselle  Casino,  in  the  finals  by  the  following 
score  :  6/0,  6/2,  6/4.  The  mixed  doubles  also  brought  out  some  excel-

INTERCOLLEGIATE  TOURNAMENTS 


INTERCOLLEGIATE   CHAMPIONSHIP  TOURNAMENT. 

The  Intercollegiate  championship  tournament  was  again  held  on 
the  courts  of  the  Merion  Cricket  Club  at  Haverford,  near  Philadelphia, 
but  owing  to  inclement  weather  the  finals  in  both  singles  and  doubles 
were  not  played  until  several  weeks  after  the  beginning  of  the 
tournament.  In  the  singles,  Dewhurst  of  the  University  of  Pennsyl- 
vania came  through  to  the  finals  and  defeated  L.  E.  Mahan,  the 
Columbia  University  champion.  This  was  a  decided  surprise,  as  the 
Columbia  entries  were  particularly  strong  and  also  those  from  Har- 
vard, which  included  J.  I.  B.  Larned,  R.  Bishop,  H.  Cole  and  B. 
Prentice,  the  captain  of  the  Harvard  team.  The  semi-finals  proved 
exceedingly  interesting,  as  Mahan  defeated  his  college  mate  Thurber, 
while  Dewhurst  defeated  Clapp  of  Yale.  When  the  final  match  for 
the  championship  was  arranged,  Dewhurst  overcame  the  Columbia 
champion  in  straight  sets,  the  score  being  6/3,  6/1,  6/2.  The  doubles 
resulted  in  a  victory  for  the  Yale  team,  as  Clapp  and  Colson  defeated 
the  Columbia  pair,  Mahan  and  McLaughlin,  in  straight  sets,  in  only 
the  first  of  which  was  the  score  close.     The  summaries :

THE  WOMEN'S   CHAMPIONSHIPS 


The  seventeenth  annual  tournament  for  the  United  States  cnampion- 
ship  in  women's  singles  and  doubles  was  held  as  usual  on  the  courts' 
of  the  Philadelphia  Cricket  Club  at  Wissahickon,  Chestnut  Hill, 
Philadelphia,  on  June  24  and  succeeding  days.  The  weather  on  the 
opening  day  was  anything  but  June-like,  being  cold  and  disagreeable. 
The  entry  list  included  the  following  well  known  players :  Miss 
Elizabeth  H.  Moore.  Kings  County  Tennis  Club ;  Miss  C.  B.  Neely, 
Kenwood  Tennis  Club,  Chicago  ;  Miss  Miriam  Hall,  California  Tennis

Chase,  Merion  C.  C.  ;  Miss  Margery  F.  Oberteuffer,  Merlon  C.  C, 
and  Miss  Gertrude  Fetterman,  Philadelphia  C.  C.  The  singles  re- 
sulted in  a  victory  for  Miss  Moore,  who  challenged  Miss  Jones,  the 
holder  of  the  title,  and  defeated  her,  both  players  giving  an  exhibi- 
tion of  brilliant  play. 

In  the  doubles  Miss  Moore  and  Miss  Neely  had  as  opponents  in  the 
final  round  Miss  Jones  and  Miss  Hall.  The  game  took  almost  two 
hours  to  reach  a  conclusion.  In  the  third  game  of  the  first  set  deuce

THE   NATIONAL  INDOOR  CHAMPIONSHIP 
TOURNAMENT 


The  fifth  annual  tournament  for  the  indoor  championship  of  Amer- 
ica was  held  under  the  auspices  of  the  United  States  ^National  Lawn 
Tennis'  Association  in  the  Seventh  Regiment  Armory,  Sixty-sixth  Street 
and  Park  Avenue,  New  York,  during  the  week  of  February  18,  1904. 
Twenty-six  of  the  foremost  players  of  the  country  participated  in  the 
singles  and  only  one  default  was  recorded  in  the  preliminary  round 
and  one  in  the  first  round.  These  were  of  Sheppard  Homans  and 
Raymond  D.  Little,  and  while  they  did  not  figure  in  the  singles,  the 
defaults  actually  helped  to  increase  the  interest  in  the  doubles. 
Throughout  the  entire  tournament  the  playing  of  the  men  on  the  board 
courts  was  remarkably  high  class  and  in  every  way  the  meeting  was 
far  more  successful  than  its  predecessors. 

The  field  in  the  singles  was  sifted  out  rapidly,  the  only  important 
matches  that  preceded  the  finals  being  those  between  Theodore  Roose- 
velt Pell,  Jr.,  who  defeated  B.  S.  Prentice  of  Harvard,  and  C.  C.  Kelly, 
who  defeated  Calhoun  Cragin.  While  the  Pell-Prentice  match  lasted 
but  two  sets,  the  score  was  very  close  and  all  of  the  points  were 
keenly  contested.  Kelly  demonstrated  that  he  was  to  be  considered 
as  one  of  the  comers  of  the  present  season,  for  he  gave  the  eldier 
Cragin  a  very  hard  match,  which  was  continued  through  three  sets 
of  fine  and  fast  tennis.  After  the  first  round,  Wylie  C.  Grant  of  the 
New  York  Lawn  Tennis  Club  advanced  to  the  final  and  championship 
round  by  defaults,  as  his  playing  partner,  Robert  LeRoy,  of  Columbia 
University,  gave  way  to  Grant  in  the  second  round  and  W.  Raymond 
defaulted  to  Grant  in  the  semi-finals.  Kelly  had  a  hard  tussle  with 
Pell  in  the  semi-finals,  but  came  off  victorious  after  three  close  sets. 
Five  sets  were  necessary  to  decide  the  championship,  as  Kelly  played 
Grant,  the  holder  of  the  championship,  with  consummate  skill  and 
nearly  wore  him  out  before  the  match  was  finished.  Grant  was  some- 
what unfortunate  in  the  third  set,  as  he  fell  in  striving  to  get  a 
difficult  ball,  so  severely  hurting  his  arm  that  he  was  unable  to  play 
his  great  overhead  strokes  during  the  remainder  of  the  match,  al- 
though he  was  finally  successful  in  winning  and  retaining  his  title. 

The  doubles  furnished  excellent  sport,  as  there  was  a  fine  sprinkling 
of  the  college  teams  among  the  competitors.  The  Princeton-Harvard 
combination  of  Raymond  D.  Little  and  Reals  C.  Wright  won  their 
way  to  the  finals,  where  they  met  the  holders  of  the  title,  Wylie  C. 
Grant  and  Robert  LeRoy.  The  play  of  the  champions  was  too  well 
suited  to  the  fast  board  courts  to  be  easily  overcome,  and  despite 
the  splendid  work  on  the  part  of  Little  and  Wright,  the  championship

LAWS  OF   LAWN  TENNIS 


THE  COURT. 
I.  The  Court  is  78  feet  long  and  27  feet  wide.  It  is  divided 
across  the  middle  by  a  net,  the  ends  of  which  are  attached  to  two 
posts,  A  and  B,  standing  3  feet  outside  of  the  court  on  either 
side.  The  height  of  the  net  is  3  feet  6  inches  at  the  posts,  and  3 
feet  in  the  middle.     At  each  end  of  the  court,  parallel  with  the

net,  and  39  feet  from  it,  are  drawn  the  base  lines  D  E  and  F  G, 
the  ends  of  which  are  connected  by  the  side  lines  D  F  and  E  G. 
Halfway  betwTeen  the  side  lines,  and  parallel  with  them,  is  drawn 
the  half  court  line  I  H,  dividing  the  space  on  each  side  of  the 
net  into  two  equal  parts,  the  right  and  left  courts.  On  each  side 
of  the  net,  at  a  distance  of  21  feet  from  it,  and  parallel  with  it, 
are  drawn  the  service  lines  K  L  and  M  N. 


THE  BALLS. 
2.     The  Balls  shall  measure  not  less  than  2^2  inches,  nor  more 
than  2  9-16  inches  in  diameter ;   and   shall  weigh  not  less  than 
1  15-16  ounces,  nor  more  than  2  ounces. 


130  SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

THE  GAME. 

3.  The  choice  of  sides,  and  the  right  to  serve  in  the  first  game, 
shall  be  decided  by  toss ;  provided  that,  if  the  winner  of  the 
toss  choose  the  right  to  serve,  the  other  player  shall  have  choice 
cf  sides,  and  vice  versa,  or  the  winner  of  the  toss  may  insist 
upon  a  choice  by  his  opponent.  If  one  player  choose  the  court, 
the  other  may  elect  not  to  serve. 

4.  The  players  shall  stand  on  opposite  sides  of  the  net ;  the 
player  who  first  delivers  the  ball  shall  be  called  the  server,  and 
the   other  the  striker-out. 

5.  At  the  end  of  the  first  game  the  striker-out  shall  become 
server,  and  the  server  shall  become  striker-out ;  and  so  on  alter- 
nately in  all  the  subsequent  games  of  the  set  and  following  sets. 

6.  The  server  shall  serve  with  both  feet  behind,  i.  e.,  further 
from  the  net  than  the  base  line  and  within  the  limits  of  the 
imaginary  continuation  of  the  centre  service  and  the  side  lines. 
It  is  not  a  fault  if  one  only  of  the  server's  feet  do  not  touch  the 
ground  at  the  moment  at  which  the  service  is  delivered.  He 
shall  place  both  feet  upon  the  ground  immediately  before  serv- 
ing and  shall  not  take  a  running  nor  a  walking  start.  He 
shall  deliver  the  service  from  the  right  and  left  courts  alter- 
nately, beginning  from  the  right,  in  each  of  his  service  games 
even  though  odds  be  given  or  owed. 

7.  The  ball  served  must  drop  between  the  service  line,  half- 
court  line,  and  side  line  of  the  court,  diagonally  opposite  to  that 
from  which  it  was  served. 

8.  It  is  a  Fault  if  tile  ball  served  drop  in  the  net,  or  beyond 
the  service  line,  or  out  of  court,  or  in  the  wrong  court ;  or  if  the 
server  do  not  stand  as  directed  by  law  6.  If  the  server,  in 
attempting  to  serve,  miss  the  ball  altogether,  it  does  not  count 
a  fault,  but  if  the  ball  be  touched,  no  matter  how  slightly,  by  the 
racket,  a  service  is  thereby  delivered,  and  the  laws  governing 
the  service  at  once  apply. 

9.  A  fault  cannot  be  taken. 

10.  After  a  fault  the  server  shall  serve  again  from  the  same 
court  from  which  he  served  that  fault,  unless  it  was  a  fault 
because  he  served  from  the  wrong  court. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  131 

11.  A  fault  cannot  be  claimed  after  the  next  service  is  delivered. 

12.  The  server  shall  not  serve  till  the  striker-out  is  ready. 
If  the  latter  attempt  to  return  the  service,  he  shall  be  deemed 
ready. 

13.  A  service  or  fault  delivered  when  the  striker-out  is  not 
ready  counts   for   nothing. 

14.  The  service  shall  not  be  volleyed,  that  is,  taken,  before  it 
has  touched  the  ground. 

15.  A  ball  is  in  play  on  leaving  the  server's  racket,  except 
as  provided  for  in  law  8,  and  remains  in  play  till  the  stroke  is 
decided. 

16.  It  is  a  good  return,  although  the  ball  touch  the  net ;  but 
a  service,  otherwise  good,  which  touches  the  net  shall  count  for 
nothing. 

17.  The  server  wins  a  stroke  if  the  striker-out  volley  the  ser- 
vice, or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  service  or  the  ball  in  play;  or 
if  he  return  the  service  or  the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside 
of  his  opponent's  court;  or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke,  as  pro- 
vided by  law  20. 

18.  The  striker-out  wins  a  stroke  if  the  server  serve  two 
consecutive  faults;  or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  ball  in  play;  or  if 
he  return  the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  oppo- 
nent's court ;  or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke  as  provided  by 
law  20. 

19.  A  ball  falling  on  a  line  is  regarded  as  falling  in  the  court 
bounded  by  that  line. 

20.  Either  player  loses  a  stroke  if  the  ball  touch  him,  or  any- 
thing that  he  wears  or  carries,  except  his  racket  in  the  act  of 
striking;  or  if  he  touch  the  ball  with  his  racket  more  than  once; 
or  if  he  touch  the  net  or  any  of  its  supports  while  the  ball  is  in 
play;  or  if  he  volley  the  ball  before  it  has  passed  the  net. 

21.  In  case  a  player  is  obstructed  by  any  accident,  not  within 
his  control,  the  ball  shall  be  considered  a  "let."  But  when  a 
permanent  fixture  of  the  court  is  the  cause  of  the  accident,  the 
point  shall  be  counted.  The  benches  and  chairs  placed  around 
the  court  shall  be  considered  permanent  fixtures.  If,  however, 
a  ball  in  play  strike  a  permanent  fixture  of  the  court  (other  than 


132  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

the  net  or  posts)  before  it  touches  the  ground,  the  point  is  lost; 
if  after  it  has  touched  the  ground,  the  point  shall  be  counted. 

22.  On  either  player  winning  his  first  stroke,  the  score  is 
called  15  for  that  player;  on  cither  player  winning  his  second 
stroke,  the  score  is  called  30  for  that  player;  on  either  player 
winning  his  third  stroke,  the  score  is  called  40  for  that  player; 
and  the  fourth  stroke  won  by  either  player  is  scored  game  for 
that  player,  except  as  below.  If  both  players  have  won  three 
strokes,  the  score  is  called  deuce;  and  the  next  stroke  won  by 
either  player  is  scored  advantage  for  that  player.  If  the  same 
player  win  the  next  stroke,  he  wins  the  game ;  if  he  lose  the  next 
stroke  the  score  returns  to  deuce,  and  so  on  until  one  player 
wins  the  two  strokes  immediately  following  the  score  of  deuce, 
when  game  is  scored  for  that  player. 

23.  The  player  who  first  wins  six  games  wins  the  set;  except 
as  below:  If  both  players  win  five  games  the  score  is  called 
games  all;  and  the  next  game  won  by  either  player  is  scored 
advantage  game  for  that  player.  If  the  same  player  win  the 
next  game,  he  wins  the  set;  if  he  lose  the  next  game,  the  score 
returns  to  games  all ;  and  so  on,  until  either  player  wins  the  two 
games  immediately  following  the  score  of  games  all,  when  he 
wins  the  set.  But  the  committee  having  charge  of  any  tourna- 
ment may  in  their  discretion  modify  this  rule  by  the  omission  of 
advantage  sets. 

24.  The  players  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first, 
third  and  every  subsequent  alternate  game  of  each  set  and  at 
the  end  of  each  set,  unless  the  number  of  games  in  such  set  be 
even.  It  shall,  however,  be  open  to  the  players  by  mutual  con- 
sent and  notification  to  the  umpire  before  the  opening  of  the 
second  game  of  the  match  to  change  sides  instead  at  the  end  of 
every  set  until  the  odd  and  concluding  set,  in  which  they  shall 
change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first,  third  and  every  subsequent 
alternate   game   of   such   set. 

*25.     In    all    contests   the   play    shall   be   continuous    from   the 
*  AH   matches  in  which  women  take  part  in  tournaments  held  un- 
der  the   auspices   of   the   United   States   National    Lawn    Tennis   Asso- 
ciation shall  be  the  best  two  in  three  sets,  with  a  rest  not  exceeding 
seven  minutes  after  the  second  set. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  133 

first  service  till  the  match  be  concluded;  provided,  however, 
that  at  the  end  of  the  third  set  either  player  is  entitled  to  a 
rest,  which  shall  not  exceed  seven  minutes,  and  provided,  fur- 
ther, that  in  case  of  an  unavoidable  accident,  not  within  the  con- 
trol of  the  contestants,  a  cessation  of  play  which  shall  not  ex- 
ceed two  minutes  may  be  allowed  between  points ;  but  this  pro- 
viso shall  be  strictly  construed,  and  the  privilege  never  granted 
for  the  purpose  of  allowing  a  player  to  recover  his  strength 
or  wind.  The  referee  in  his  discretion  may  at  any  time  post- 
pone the  match  on  account  of  darkness  or  condition  of  the 
ground  or  weather.  In  any  case  of  postponement,  the  previous 
score  shall  hold  good.  Where  the  play  has  ceased  for  more 
than  an  hour,  the  player  who  at  the  cessation  thereof  was  in 
the  court  first  chosen  shall  have  the  choice  of  courts  on  the  re- 
commencement of  play.  He  shall  stay  in  the  court  he  chooses 
for  the  remainder  of  the  set.  The  last  two  sentences  of  this 
rule  do  not  apply  when  the  players  change  every  alternate  game 
as  provided  by  law  24. 

26.  If  a  player  serve  out  of  his  turn,  the  umpire,  as  soon  as 
the  mistake  is  discovered,  shall  direct  the  player  to  serve  who 
ought  to  have  served.  But  all  strokes  scored  before  such  dis- 
covery shall  be  counted.  If  a  game  shall  have  been  completed 
before  such  discovery,  then  the  service  in  the  next  alternate 
game  shall  be  delivered  by  the  player  who  did  not  serve  out  of 
his  turn,  and  so  on  in  regular  rotation. 

27.  The  above  laws  shall  apply  to  the  three-handed  and  four- 
handed  games,  except  as  below : 

THE  THREE-HANDED  AND  FOUR-HANDED  GAMES. 

28.  For  the  three-handed  and  four-handed  games  the  court 
shall  be  36  feet  in  width;  4l/2  feet  inside  the  side  lines,  and 
parallel  with  them,  are  drawn  the  service  side  lines  K  M  and 
L  N.  The  service  lines  are  not  drawn  beyond  the  point  at  which 
they  meet  the  service  side  lines,  as  shown  in  the  diagram. 

29.  In  the  three-handed  game,  the  single  player  shall  serve 
in  every  alternate  game. 

30.  In  the  four-handed  game,  the  pair  who  have  the  right  to 


134 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


serve  in  the  first  game  shall  decide  which  partner  shall  do  so ; 
and  the  opposing  pair  shall  decide  in  like  manner  for  the  second 
game.  The  partner  of  the  player  who  served  in  the  first  game 
shall  serve  in  the  third,  and  the  partner  of  the  player  who 
served  in  the  second  game  shall  serve  in  the  fourth,  and  the 
same  order  shall  be  maintained  in  all  the  subsequent  games  of 
the    set. 

31.  At  the  beginning  of  the  next  set,  either  partner  of  the 
pair  which  struck  out  in  the  last  game  of  the  last  set  may  serve; 
and  the  same  privilege  is  given  to  their  opponents  in  second 
game  of  the  new  set. 

32.  The  players  shall  take  the  service  alternately  throughout 
the  game ;  a  player  cannot  receive  a  service  delivered  to  his  part- 
ner; and  the  order  of  service  and  striking  out  once  established 
shall  not  be  altered,  nor  shall  the  striker-out  change  courts  to  re- 
ceive the  service,  till  the  end  of  the   set. 

33.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  do  not  drop  between  the 
service  line,  half-court  line,  and  service  side  line  of  the  court, 
diagonally  opposite  to  that  from  which  it  was  served. 

34.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  do  not  drop  as  provided 
in  law  35,  or  if  it  touch  the  server's  partner  or  anything  he 
wears  or  carries.

DECISIONS  ON   DOUBTFUL  POINTS 


Officially  recognized  by  the  U.  S.  N.  L.  T.  A. 

I.  A  player  standing  outside  the  court  volleys  the  ball  or 
catches  it  in  his  hand,  and  claims  the  stroke  because  the  ball 
was  certainly  going  out  of  court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.  It  makes  no  difference  where 
he  was  standing.  The  return  is  presumed  good  until  it  strikes 
the  ground   outside   of   the   court. 

II.  A  player  is  struck  by  the  ball  served  before  it  has  touched 
the  ground,  he  being  outside  of  the  service  court.  How  does  it 
count? 

Decision. — The  player  struck  loses  the  stroke.  The  service  is 
presumably  good  until  it  strikes  in  the  wrong  court.  A  player 
cannot  take  the  decision  upon  himself  by  stopping  the  ball.  If 
it  is  going  to  be  a  fault,  he  has  only  to  get  out  of  the  way. 

III.  The  service  is  delivered  before  the  striker-out  is  ready. 
He  tries  to  return  it  and  fails.  Is  he  entitled  to  have  it  played 
over  again? 

Decision. — No.  If  he  attempts  to  return  the  service  he  is 
deemed  ready. 

IV.  The  striker-out  calls  "Not  ready,"  for  a  second  service. 
The  ball  strikes  beyond  the  service  line,  and  the  striker-out 
claims  that  the  fact  that  he  was  not  ready  makes  no  difference, 
since  a  fault  cannot  be  returned,  and,  therefore,  that  two  faults 
have  been  served. 

Decision. — The  second  service  goes  for  nothing.  A  player 
cannot  call  "Not  ready,"  and  then  have  the  service  count,  or  not, 
as  suits  his  interests. 

V.  A  ball  having  been  played  over  the  net  bounds  back  into 
the  court  from  which  it  came.  The  player  reaches  over  the  net 
and  plays  it  before  it  falls.     Has  he  a  right  to  do  so? 

Decision. — Yes,  provided  he  does  not  touch  the  net.  He  has 
a  right  to  play  the  ball  at  any  time  from  the  moment  it  crosses 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  137 

the  net  into  his  court  until  it  touches  the  ground  a  second  time. 

VI.  A  ball  is  played  into  the  net ;  the  player  on  the  other 
side,  thinking  that  the  ball  is  coming  over,  strikes  at  it  and  hits 
the  net.     Who  loses  the  stroke? 

Decision. — It  is  simply  a  question  of  fact  for  the  umpire  to 
decide.  If  the  player  touched  the  net  while  the  ball  was  still  in 
play  he  loses  the  stroke. 

VII.  Can  a  player  follow  a  ball  over  the  net  with  his  racket, 
provided  that  he  hits  the  ball  on  his  own  side  of  the  net? 

Decision. — Yes,  the  only  restrictions  are  that  he  shall  not  vol- 
ley the  ball  until  it  has  crossed  the  net,  and  that  he  shall  not 
touch  the  net  or  any  of  its  supports. 

VIII.  A  player's  racket  slips  out  of  his  hand  and  flies  into 
the  net.    Does  he  lose  the  stroke  for  hitting  the  net? 

Decision. — Yes,  if  the  ball  be  still  in  play.  It  does  not  matter 
if  the  racket  be  in  a  player's  hand  or  not. 

IX.  A  player's  racket  leaves  his  hand,  but  meets  the  ball 
and  returns  it  over  the  net.     Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Yes.  There  is  no  law  requiring  a  racket  to  be  in  a 
player's  hand  when  the  ball  is  returned.  It  would  unquestion- 
ably be  a  good  return  if  the  racket  were  held  against  the 
ground  by  a  player's  feet,  and  the  ball  bounded  back  off  of  it. 

X.  A  single  match  is  played  with  a  double  net  and  inside 
posts.  A  player  touches  the  net  beyond  the  inside  posts,  and 
claims  that  he  does  not  lose  the  stroke  because  there  should  be 
no  net  more  than  three   feet   outside  of  the   court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.  The  net  where  he  touches  it 
is  part  of  the  supports  of  the  net.  He  might,  perhaps,  have  ob- 
jected  to   the   arrangement   of  the  net   before   the   match. 

XI.  A  player  returns  the  ball,  and,  finding  that  he  cannot  stop 
himself  before  reaching  the  net,  jumps  over  it.    Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Law  4  requires  that  "the  players  shall  stand  on  op- 
posite sides  of  the  net,"  and  therefore  the  player  invading  his 
opponent's   court   loses   the   stroke. 

XII.  A  ball  passes  outside  the  post  of  the  net  and  strikes  in 
court.     Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Yes. 


138  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

XIII.  A  ball  going  out  of  court  hits  the  top  of  the  posts  of 
the  net  and  bounds  into  the  opposite  court. 

Decision. — It   is   a  good   return. 

XIV.  The  service  or  the  ball  in  play  strikes  a  ball  lying  in 
the  court.     Can  it  be  returned? 

Decision. — Yes,  if  it  be  clear  to  the  umpire  that  the  right  ball 
is   returned. 

XV.  The  server  claims  that  the  striker-out  must  stand  in  the 
court.     Is  this   necessary? 

Decision. — No.  The  striker-out  can  stand  wherever  he  pleases 
on  his  own  side  of  the  net. 

XVI.  A  bystander  gets  in  the  way  of  a  player  who  fails  to 
return  the  ball.     May  he  then  claim  a  let? 

Decision. — Yes,  if,  in  the  umpire's  opinion,  he  was  prevented 
by  an  accident  beyond  his  control.  For  instance,  if  the  ropes 
or  the  seats  are  allowed  to  be  so  near  to  the  court  that  a  player 
is  interfered  with  by  them,  the  stroke  should  not  be  played  again, 
because  the  ropes  and  seats  form  part  of  the  arrangements  of  the 
ground.  If,  however,  a  spectator  passes  in  front  of  those  seats, 
or  places  a  chair  nearer  than  the  original  line,  and  so  interferes 
with   a  player,  the   stroke   should   be   played   again. 

XVII.  A  player  is  interfered  with  as  above,  and  the  umpire 
directs  the  stroke  to  be  played  again.  The  server  had  previously 
served  a  fault.     He  claims   the   right  to  two   services. 

Decision. — The  fault  stands.  A  let  does  not  annul  a  previous 
fault. 

XVIII.  A  return  hits  the  umpire,  or  his  chair  or  stand,  the 
player    claims   that   the   ball    was    going   into    court. 

Decision. — Stroke    is    lost. 

XIX.  A  player  receiving  fifteen  serves  from  the  left  court. 
His  opponent   claims  a  fault. 

Decision. — It  is  a  fault.  The  service  starts  from  the  right 
court  under  all   circumstances. 

XX.  At  fifteen-all  the  server  by  mistake  serves  from  the 
left  court,  he  wins  the  stroke  and  serves  again  (a  fault),  the 
mistake  is  then  discovered.  Is  he  entitled  to  the  previous  stroke? 
From  which  court  should  he  serve  next? 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  139 

Decision. — The  previous  stroke  stands.  A  fault  cannot  be 
claimed  after  the  next  service,  good  or  not,  is  delivered.  The 
next  service  should  be  from  the  left  court,  the  score  being 
thirty-fifteen,  and  the  server  has  served  one  fault. 

XXI.  A  player  serves  from  the  wrong  court,  he  loses  the 
stroke,  and  then  claims  that  it  was  a  fault. 

Decision. — If  the  stroke  was  played  in  his  first  service  it  is 
simply  a  fault,  but  if  he  serves  twice  into  the  wrong  court  he 
has  served  two  faults,  and  lost  the  stroke. 

XXII.  The  score  is  five  games  all,  and  the  umpire  directs 
the  players  to  play  an  advantage  set.  The  advantage  game  has 
been  won,  when  it  is  discovered  that  no  advantage  sets  are  to  be 
played.    What  is  to  be  done? 

Decision. — The  set  is  won  at  the  eleventh  game.  It  is  no  part 
of  the  umpire's  duty  to  decide  on  the  conditions  of  the  matches. 

XXIII.  A  player  serves.  He  hears  the  umpire  call,  but  can- 
not hear  what  he  says.  He  knows  that  the  only  two  things  that 
the  umpire  should  call  are  "fault"  and  "let,"  and  that  in  neither 
case  can  the  ball  be  in  play.  He,  therefore,  does  not  return  it, 
only  to  find  that  the  umpire  has  called  "play."  Has  he  any  re- 
dress? 

Decision. — No. 

XXIV.  The  umpire  calls  "fault,"  and  then  instantly  changes 
and  says  "play."  The  striker-out  fails  to  return  the  ball,  and  he 
claims  he  was  prevented  by  the  umpire,  and  also  that  the  umpire 
cannot  change  his  decision. 

Decision. — The  umpire  should  call  a  let  and  the  service  be 
taken   again. 

XXV.  A  ball  drops  near  a  line,  the  player  appeals,  and  the 
umpire  calls  "play."  The  player  misunderstands  the  call  and 
lets  the  ball  fall.    He  then  claims  to  have  the  stroke  played  again. 

Decision. — The    stroke    stands. 

XXVI.  The  ball  strikes  the  ground  close  to  a  line  the  scorer 
scores  the  stroke  against  the  striker.  On  appeal  to  the  linesman, 
the  latter  decided  that  the  ball  was  not  out.  Which  decision 
stands? 

Decision. — The  scorer  has  no  right  to  consider  a  ball  out  until 


140  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

the  linesman  has  called  to  that  effect,  therefore,  the  decision  of 
the  latter  must  be  accepted.  The  decision  of  a  linesman  affecting 
his  own  line  is  final. 

XXVII.  A  return  strikes  the  cord  running  along  the  bottom 
of  the  net  and  bounds  over.     Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXVIII.  During  play  a  ball  is  thrown  into  court,  and  the 
ball  in  play  strikes  it  or  a  player  steps  on  it.  May  a  let  be 
claimed? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXIX..    The  server's  first  service  strikes  his  partner.  Does  he 
lose  the   stroke  or   is   it   a  fault? 
Decision. — A  fault. 

XXX.  A  player  serves  a  fault  and  it  is  then  discovered  that 
it  is  his  partner's  service.     Does  the  fault  stand? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXXI.  In  a  four-handed  competition  one  player  does  not  ap- 
pear in  time  to  play,  and  his  partner  claims  to  be  allowed  to 
play  single-handed  against  the  opposing  pair.     May  he  do  so? 

Decision. — No. 


UNOFFICIAL  DECISIONS   ON   DOUBTFUL   POINTS. 
(From  Lazvn  Tennis.) 

Both  of  the  opponents  of  the  servers  in  doubles  are  strikers- 
out  alternately  during  a  game.  It  is  optional  with  them  which 
shall  serve  first,  but  they  must  serve  alternately  throughout  each 
set. 

A  player  does  not  lose  a  stroke  for  striking  at  a  ball  that 
ultimately  falls  outside  his  court,  providing  he  does  not  touch 
it  in  doing  so. 

If  one  partner  of  a  double  team  strikes  at  a  ball  and  does 
not  touch  it,  his  partner  still  has  the  right  to  return  it.  A  player 
or  different  member  of  a  team  may  strike  at  a  ball  as  often  as 
they  please;   it  is   still  in  play  until   hit. 

A  served  ball  is  only  a  "let"  if  otherwise  good,  falling  in  the 
proper  court ;  a  fault  cannot  be  a  "let." 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  141 

The  server  must  stand  behind  the  base-line,  within  the  limits 
of  the   side-lines  of  the  court  in  which  he  is  playing. 

There  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of  "let"  balls  that  may  be 
made  on  the  service,  and  the  server  continues  serving  in  the  same 
court  until  a  good  service  is  delivered  or  two  faults  are  made. 

The  server  must  wait  until  the  striker-out  is  ready  for  the 
second  service  as  well  as  the  first,  and  if  the  striker-out  claims 
to  be  not  ready  and  does  not  make  any  effort  to  return  the  second 
service,  the  server  cannot  claim  the  point,  even  though  the  service 
was  good. 

If  a  player's  racket  touches  the  net  after  the  ball  has  struck 
the  net,  he  does  not  lose  the  point.  The  ball  is  dead  and  the 
point  has  been  won  and  lost  as  soon  as  the  ball  strikes  the  net, 
and  nothing  which  happens  afterward  can  affect  that  point. 
If  the  ball  knocks  the  net  against  the  player's  racket  the  same 
decision  holds  good ;  it  is  simply  a  question  for  the  referee  to  de- 
cide which  touches  the  net  first. 

In  doubles  partners  must  receive  throughout  each  set  on  the 
same  sides  of  the  court  which  they  originally  select  when  the  set 
begins.  The  first  server  is  not  required  to  receive  in  the 
right  court ;  he  may  select  either  side  at  the  beginning  of  the 
set,  but  must  hold  this  to  the  end. 

A  ball  served  with  a  sharp  cut  that  bounds  back  over  the  net 
after  having  struck  in  the  right  court  is  a  good  service.  The 
point  counts  in  favor  of  the  server  if  the  striker-out  fails  to 
return  it.  The  latter  may  reach  over  the  net  to  return  the  ball, 
but   loses  the   point   if  he  touches  the  net   in   doing  so. 

A  return  made  from  one  side  of  the  court  that  passes  outside 
of  the  net  and  posts  without  going  over  them  is  still  good  if 
the  ball   falls  in  the  proper  court. 

The  ball  is  always  in  play  until  it  has  struck  the  ground  out- 
side of  the  court,  or  the  net,  or  has  touched  the  ground  twice. 
The  player  loses  a  point  if  the  ball  touches  him  or  his  clothing 
while  still  in  play,  no  matter  whether  he  is  standing  outside  of 
the  court  when  the  ball  hits  him,  or  not. 

An  officially  recognized  decision  has  been  rendered  that  makes 
any  support  of  the  net — the  posts,  the  guy-ropes,  or  the  centre 


142  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

fork — a  part  of  the  net  itself,  and  any  ball  hitting  one  of  these 
supports  and  still  striking  the  right  court  is  considered  a  good 
return  (except  on  the  service).  The  posts  are  required  to  stand 
outside  of  the  court,  and  yet  a  ball  being  returned  at  a  sharp 
angle  from  outside  might  well  be  going  in  and  still  touch  one 
of  the  posts. 

A  ball  is  dead  the  instant  it  has  touched  the  ground  outside 
of  the  court,  and  the  point  must  be  scored  at  once  against  the 
other  side,  no  matter  what  happens  after  the  ball  touches  the 
ground. 

Consolation  matches  in  America  are  always  open  to  any  player 
beaten  in  his  first  match  actually  played.  Winning  by  default 
before  defeat  in  the  first  actual  match  does  not  disqualify  a  player 
from  the  consolation  event. 

The  services  must  always  come  alternately  from  the  right 
and  left  courts ;  if  the  server  delivers  the  ball  from  the  wrong 
court  it  is  a  fault. 

A  fault  cannot  be  played,  and  the  striker-out  has  no  option  in 
the  matter ;  it  does  not  make  the  service  good  if  he  returns  it.

REGULATIONS  FOR  THE  MANAGEMENT 
OF  TOURNAMENTS

have  full  power  over  all  details  concerning  said  Tournament,  but 
shall  be  entitled  to  delegate  their  power  to  a  Committee.  In 
case  no  special  Committee  shall  be  appointed  by  the  Officers  of 
the  Club  holding  the  Tournament,  the  powers  and  functions  here- 
inafter delegated  to  the  Committee  shall  be  vested  in  and  per- 
formed by  the  Officers  of  said  Club.

conditions  of  the  competition,  and  including  names  of  Tourna- 
ment Committee  and  of  the  Referee. 

4.  No  cheques,  orders  for  money  or  cash  payments  in 
any  form  shall  be  given  as  prizes,  and  the  amount  actually 
paid  for  each  prize  shall  in  no  case  be  below  the  adver- 
tised value  of  the  same,  if  included  in  circular.  If  any

Lawn  Tennis  Association.  The  winner  of  a  Challenge  Cup 
shall  be  entitled  to  the  possession  of  the  cup  until  one 
month  previous  to  the  next  competition  for  the  cup,  posses- 
sion being  conditional  on  the  giving  of  a  bond  by  the  winner 
satisfactory  to  the  Club.  Should  the  Club  give  possession  without 
such  bond,  it  shall  be  liable  to  the  National  Association  for  the 
value  of  the  cup. 

5.  The  Committee  shall  elect  a  Referee,  with  power  to  ap- 
point   a    substitute    to    be    approved    by    them.      The    Referee    or 


144  SPALDING'S     LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL. 

his  duly  appointed  substitute  must  be  present  at  all  times  when 
play  is  in  progress. 

6.  The  Referee  or  such  other  member  or  members  of  the 
Committee  as  may  be  selected  for  the  purpose,  shall  have  power 
to  appoint  Umpires  and  Linesmen,  to  assign  courts  and  to  start 
matches,  and  the  Referee  shall  decide  any  point  of  law  which  an 
Umpire  may  profess  himself  unable  to  decide,  or  which  may  be 
referred  to  him  on  appeal  from  the  decision  of  an  Umpire,  and 
such  decision  shall  be  final. 

7.  The  Referee  shall,  during  the  Tournament,  be  ex-officio  a 
member  of  the  Committee. 

8.  The  Committee  shall  help  to  keep  order  on  the  ground, 
and  shall  consult  and  decide  upon  any  question  arising  out  of 
the  competition,  if  summoned  for  that  purpose  by  the  Referee 
or  by  any  two  of  their  number :  and  they  shall  have  power,  when 
so  convened,  the  misconduct  of  a  competitor  having  been  reported 
to  them  by  a  member  of  the  Committee  or  an  Umpire,  to  dis- 
qualify the  offender,  and  further  to  order  him  off  the  ground, 
should  his  misconduct  appear  to  them  to  justify  such  action,  but 
before  such  action  shall  be  taken,  an  opportunity  of  offering  an 
explanation  shall  be  afforded  to  the  competitor,  whose  miscon- 
duct has  been  reported  to  them. 

9.  It  is  the  duty  of  an  Umpire — 

(a)  To  ascertain  that  the  net  is  at  the  right  height  before 
the  commencement  of  play,  and  to  measure  and  adjust  the 
net  during  play,  if  asked  to  do  so,  or  if,  in  his  opinion,  its 
height  has  altered. 

(b)  To  call  the  faults  (subject  to  Regulation  10)  and  lets 
unless   he   delegates    such   power. 

(c)  To  call  the  strokes  when  won,  or  when  he  is  asked  to 
call  them,  and  to  record  them  upon  the  Umpire's  scoring  sheet. 
(See  example  on  next  page.) 


Xote — At  the  end  of  each  game  the  games  should  be  called  with 
the  name  of  the  player  who  is  in  advance,  thus:  "2  games  to  1.  B 
wins"  or,  "B  leads."  If  the  games  are  level  the  score  should  be  called 
thus,  "three  games  all."  or  as  the  case  may  be.  At  the  end  of  each 
set  the  sets  should  be  called  in  like  manner. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.

Provided,  that  no  omission  of  any  of  the  foregoing  duties  on 
the  part  of  an  Umpire  shall  of  itself  invalidate  a  game  or 
match. 

10.  It  is  the  duty  of  the  Linesman  to  call  faults  and  to  decide 
strokes  relating  to  the  line  or  lines  to  which  he  is  assigned  and  to 
said  line  or  lines  only,  and  such  decision  shall  be  final.  Should  the 
Linesman  be  unable  to  give  a  decision,  the  Umpire  shall  decide 
or  shall  direct  the  stroke  to  be  played  again. 


In  scoring  handicap  matches?,  the  odds  received  should  he  marked

ii.  The  decision  of  an  Umpire  shall  be  final  upon  every  ques- 
tion of  fact,  and  no  competitor  may  appeal  from  it;  but  if  an 
Umpire  be  in  doubt  as  to  a  point  of  law,  or  if  a  competitor  appeal 
against  his  decision  on  such  a  point,  the  Umpire  shall  submit  it 
to  the  Referee  whose  decision  shall  be  final. 

Note.— A  question  of  fact  relates  to  events  that  actually  happened.  A  ques- 
tion of  law  is  the  construction  and  application  of  the  laws  of  the  game  to  the 
admitted  facts. 

12.  The  Referee  shall  not  bet  on  a  match  nor  shall  an  Um- 
pire or  Linesman  on  the  match  to  which  he  is  assigned.  An  in- 
fraction of  this  rule  shall  be  followed  by  the  immediate  removal 


When  odds  are  owed,  they  should  be  marked  on  the  left  of  the

18.  If  a  competitor  be  absent  when  called  on  to  play,  or  shall 
refuse  to  play  (unless  he  has  been  formally  excused  for  a  definite 
period  by  the  Referee),  or  shall  have  given  previous  notice  to  the 
Referee,  or  a  member  of  the  Committee  that  he  cannot  play  in  his 
next  round,  his  adversary  shall  win  in  that  round. 

19.  In  handicap  matches  the  competitors  shall  be  handicapped 
by  the  Committee,  or  by  a  Handicapper  appointed  by  the  Com- 
mittee. 

20.  The  method  of  handicapping  shall  be  by  classes  as  below — 

Given  Odds. 
Class   O — (Scratch). 
Class     1  receives  i-sixth  of  15.

When  two  players  in  different  classes  below  scratch  meet,  the 
superior  player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  received  by 
the  inferior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table  No.  1.  To 
use  the  table,  find  in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures  the  number  rep- 
resenting the  class  of  the  superior  player,  then  travel  along  the 
horizontal   column  until   the   vertical   column   is   reached   which 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  153 

bears  at  the  top  the  number  of  the  class  of  the  inferior  player. 
The  odds  specified  at  the  intersection  of  the  two  columns  are 
the  odds   required. 

Example. — If  class  3  has  to  meet  class  9,  start  from  the  figure 
3  in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures,  and  look  horizontally  until  the 
vertical  column  is  reached  headed  by  the  figure  9.  The  odds 
given  at  the  point  of  intersection  of  the  two  columns  (viz.  15 
and   1-6  of  15)    are  the  odds  required. 

When  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the  worst  players 
entered  is  great  (say  more  than  30),  it  is  desirable  to  handicap 
the  best  players  at  owed  odds.  The  players  above  scratch  (i.  e., 
owing  odds)  should  be  classified  as  follows: 

Owed  Odds. 
Class     1  owes  i-sixth  of  15.

'     40. 

When  the  two  players  in  different  classes  above  scratch  meet, 
the  inferior  player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  owed 
by  the  superior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table,  No.  2. 


154  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

This  table  is  to  be  used  in  the  same  way  as  the  former,  the 
class  of  the  superior  player  being  looked  for  in  the  horizontal 
line  of  figures  at  the  top,  and  the  class  of  the  inferior  player  in 
the   diagonal  line  of  figures. 

Example. — If  class  12  (owe  30)  meet  class  7  (owe  15  and  1-6 
of  15),  the  former  must  owe  the  latter  the  odds  of  4-6  of  15. 

21.  In  Championship  matches  and  handicaps  by  classes,  as 
above,  advantage  sets  shall  be  played  throughout. 

22.  The  Committee  may,  whether  appealed  to  by  any  competi- 
tor or  not,  postpone  the  meeting  or  any  match  or  part  of  a 
match  if,  in  their  opinion,  the  state  of  the  weather,  or  of  the 
light,  or  the  condition  of  the  ground,  or  other  circumstances,  ren- 
der it  advisable  to  do  so.  In  cases  of  postponement,  Law  26 
must   be   strictly   observed.

INSTRUCTIONS   FOR   HANDICAPPING 


GIVEN    ODDS. 

One-sixth  of  fifteen  (1-6)  is  one  stroke  given  by  the  better  to 
the  poorer  player  on  the  second,  eighth,  fourteenth  and  every 
subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  of  fifteen  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the  second, 
fourth,  eighth,  tenth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Three-sixths  of  fifteen  (3-6  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke  given 
on  the  second,  fourth,  sixth  and  every  other  alternate  game  on 
each  set. 

Four-sixths  of  fifteen  (4-6)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the  second, 
fourth,  sixth,  eighth,  tenth,  eleventh,  twelfth  and  corresponding 
games  on  each  set. 

Five-sixths  of  fifteen  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the  second, 
third,  fourth,  fifth,  sixth,  eighth,  ninth,  tenth,  eleventh,  twelfth 
and  corresponding  games  on  each  set. 

Fifteen  (15)   is  one  stroke  given  on  every  game  of  each  set. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (15.1)  is  two  strokes  given  on  the  same 
games  as  for  one-sixth,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Fifteen  and  two-sixths  (15.2)  is  two  strokes  given  on  the  same 
games  as  for  two-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Fifteen  and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty)  is  two  strokes 
given  on  the  same  games  as  for  three-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on 
each    of   the   others. 

Fifteen  and  four-sixths  (15.4)  is  two  strokes  given  on  the 
same  games  as  for  four-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the 
others. 

Fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5)  is  two  strokes  on  the  same 
games  as  for  five-sixths  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Thirty  (30)  is  two  strokes  on  each  game. 

Thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.1),  thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2), 
thirty  and  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half-forty),  thirty  and  four- 
sixths    (30.4),  thirty  and  five-sixths    (30.5)    and  forty    (40),  are 


158  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

three  strokes  and  two  given  on  the  corresponding  games  of  each 
set,  as  in  the  fifteen  series. 

OWED    ODDS. 

Owed  (or  minus)  odds  can  also  be  used  in  exactly  the  same 
quantities,  the  chief  difference  being  that  the  better  player  is 
required  to  earn  the  owed  strokes  before  he  begins  to  score, 
while,  in  the  case  of  given  odds,  the  poorer  player  is  given  his 
handicap  before  play  starts.  These  owed  odds  may  be  used 
either  in  conjunction  with  the  given  odds  or  separately.  In  order 
that  the  handicaps  may  occur  as  seldom  as  possible  in  the  same 
games,  when  two  players  meet,  one  of  whom  owes  odds  and 
the  other  receives  them,  the  games  on  which  owed  strokes  are 
paid  differ  from  those  on  which  the  given  strokes  are  taken. 
Here  is  the  table  for  owed  odds : 

One-sixth  (1-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  seventh,  thir- 
teenth and  every  subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  seventh, 
ninth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Three-sixths  (3-6  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first, 
third,  fifth  and  every  other  alternate  game  in  each  set. 

Four-sixths  (4-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fifth, 
sixth   and   corresponding   games   in   each    set. 

Five-sixths  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fourth, 
fifth,  sixth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Fifteen   (15)   is  one  stroke  owed  on  each  game. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (15.1),  fifteen  and  two-sixths  (15.2), 
fifteen  and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty),  fifteen  and  four- 
sixths  (15.4),  fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5) ,  thirty  (30),  thirty 
and  one-sixth  (30.1),  thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2),  thirty  and 
three-sixths  (30.3  or  half- forty),  thirty  and  four-sixths  (30.4), 
thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and  forty  (40),  correspond  to  the 
fractions  of  fifteen,  as  do  the  larger  handicaps  in  the  table  for 
given  odds  correspond  to  the  fractions  of  fifteen  in  that  table. 

The  simplest  method  for  handicappers  to  pursue  is  to  sort  out 
the  entries  for  the  event  they  are  to  handicap  into  classes  accord- 
ing to   the   relative   skill   of  the  players.     Then   select  the   class 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  159 

with  the  greatest  number  of  players  in  it  and  place  them  on 
scratch,  handicapping  all  of  the  other  players  either  behind  or  in 
advance  of  scratch  by  owed  or  given  odds,  so  as  to  make  all 
even  at  the  odds. 

In  deciding  upon  each  player's  handicap,  his  ability  as  com- 
pared with  the  scratch  men  should  first  be  considered,  and  then 
as  compared  with  his  nearest  and  furthest  rivals  in  the  tables 
of  odds.  Each  player  might  meet  any  of  the  others,  and  the 
object  of  handicapping  is  to  give  him  an  exactly  even  chance,  no 
matter  whom  his  opponent  may  be. 

It  should  be  remembered  that  it  is  easier  to  owe  15,  or  any 
fraction  of  it,  than  it  is  to  give  it,  and  when  odds  of  30  are  given, 
the  poorer  player's  score  has  already  reached  pretty  near  the 
end  of  the  game,  and  the  difference  between  him  and  the  best 
men  must  be  very  great  to  give  the  latter  an  even  chance,  should 
they  meet. 

It  is  very  unwise  to  give  even  the  poorer  players  over  30.3 
(half- forty),  and  very  seldom  is  it  safe  to  make  the  given  odds 
run  higher  than  30.  If  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the 
poorest  players  is  very  great,  place  the  latter  as  far  as  necessary 
behind  scratch,  but  do  not  advance  the  former  to  more  than  30, 
or  30.3  in  the  most  extreme  cases.

HOW  TO  CONDUCT  A  TOURNAMENT 


A  tournament  committee  should  first  of  all  be  selected,  with 
not  less  than  five  men,  and  as  many  as  possible  practical  work- 
ers who  have  the  time  and  inclination  to  closely  look  after  tne 
interests  of  the  club.  At  its  first  meeting,  the  committee  should 
decide  upon  all  details  of  the  meeting.  In  selecting  a  date,  it  is 
advisable  to  choose  one  immediately  before  or  after  some  estab- 
lished tournament  in  the  neighborhood,  for  then  the  entries  of 
those  who  are  to  play  in  the  other  event  can  generally  be  secured. 

Application  should  be  made  to  the  national  governing  body  for 
official  sanction  for  the  tournament,  stating  dates  and  other  par- 
ticulars. If  any  championship  events  are  to  be  on  the  programme, 
official  recognition  must  be  applied  for  before  these  titles  can  be 
of  any  value. 

A  printed  circular  should  be  issued  by  the  tournament  com- 
mittee, which  should  state  plainly — (i)  the  name  of  the  club 
and  the  location  of  the  courts  ;  (2)  the  date  of  the  meeting  and 
the  hours  of  play;  (3)  the  list  of  events,  and  the  championship 
titles  (if  any)  to  be  competed  for,  with  the  prizes  offered  for 
each  event ;  (4)  the  amount  of  the  entrance  fees,  and  place  and 
date  for  closing  the  list  of  entries;  (5)  the  name  of  referee, 
handicapper  and  tournament  committee;  and  (6)  the  time  and 
place  of  the  draw. 

The  draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  committee  in  public 
and  due  notice  of  the  time  and  place  be  given  to  the  competitors, 
so  that  they  may  be  present  or  represented  when  the  draw  is 
made.  The  draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  Bagnall-Wilde 
system.     (See  ''Tournament  Regulations,"  page  143.) 

No  money  or  its  equivalent  in  any  form  should  be  offered  on 
prizes,  for  this  would  disqualify  the  players  from  future  compe- 
tition as  amateurs.  Prizes  should  be  silver,  gold,  cut  glass,  ob- 
jects of  art  or  other  souvenirs  of  this  kind  that  can  be  marked 
or  engraved  as  trophies.     It  is  preferable  to  have  them  marked 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  m 

before  the  tournament,  although  lawn  tennis  prizes  are  fre- 
quently bought  with  the  privilege  of  exchange,  and  therefore  not 
engraved   until  after  the   tournament. 

The  committee  should  select  a  referee,  either  from  among  their 
number  or  outside  of  it.  If  handicaps  are  to  be  held,  the  referee 
may  also  be  the  handicapper,  or  a  sub-committee  may  be  ap- 
pointed for  this  purpose.  Should  the  referee  be  also  a  competi- 
tor, a  substitute  should  also  be  appointed  to  act  for  him  while  he 
is  playing. 

It  is  important  to  have  enough  balls,  and  only  the  best  quality 
of  tournament  balls  should  be  used  for  matches.  It  is  the  cus- 
tom at  most  tournaments  to  allow  three  new  balls  with  each 
match,  but  in  playing  on  dirt  courts,  the  same  balls  can  some- 
times be  made  to  do  service  twice.  Unless  there  are  back-stops 
close  behind  the  courts,  it  is  also  well  to  have  some  small  boys 
handy  to  act  as  ball-boys  and  "shack"  the  balls  for  the  players. 

The  lines  of  a  tournament  court  should  be  marked  out  fresh 
every  day  and  if  easily  obliterated,  also  between  matches  on  the 
same  day.  The  courts  should  always  be  laid  north  and  south  so 
that  one  player  will  not  get  more  than  his  share  of  the  glaring 
sunlight  in  his  eyes.  There  should  never  be  a  tree  within  shadow 
distance  of  a  tournament  court  either,  particularly  on  the  south 
side  of  the  court. 

Facilities  must  be  provided  for  the  players  to  dress,  and  it  is  a 
good  plan  to  appoint  one  member  of  the  committee  to  attend 
to  these  accommodations,  and  to  entertain  the  visiting  players 
and  see  that  their  wants  are  attended  to. 

The  draw  should  always  be  posted  in  a  conspicuous  place  on 
the  grounds,  where  the  spectators  as  well  as  the  players  can 
inspect  it.  If  possible  a  programme  for  each  day's  play  should  be 
made  out  in  advance,  and  due  notice  of  all  the  matches  of  the 
day  be  posted  up  by  the  draw  each  day.  The  courts  should  be 
numbered,  and  a  certain  court  and  hour  set  for  each  match.  One 
member  of  the  committee  ought  also  to  be  assigned  to  getting 
umpires  for  the  matches  and  seeing  that  they  are  properly  started. 

It  is  customary  to  exhibit  the  prizes  for  a  tournament  at  the 
club  grounds  during  the  tournament,  and  it  generally  proves  an 


162  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

attractive  feature  to  have  them  displayed  on  a  table  on  the 
grounds,  all  duly  labeled  so  that  spectators  can  see  which  events 
they  are  to  be  given  for.  A  refreshment  tent  is  also  an  attractive 
feature  at  a  tournament  and  the  prizes  are  then  displayed  under 
this  tent  on  the  same  or  a  nearby  table  with  the  punchbowl. 
Lemonade,  or  tea,  crackers,  cakes  and  sometimes  small  sand- 
wiches are  generally  served  to  the  players  and  spectators  under 
such  refreshment  tent.

166  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


WHAT  TO  USE  FOR   LAWN  TENNIS 


To  the  majority  of  those  who  play  lawn  tennis,  the  racket  is 
practically  the  only  implement  of  play  which  has  to  be  selected 
by  them  personally.  This,  then,  is  the  article  in  which  the  greater 
number  are  interested  and  it  shall  therefore  be  considered  first. 
Naturally  the  list  of  styles  and  qualities  on  the  market  is  a  long 
one,  but  the  line  which  is  recognized  as  standard,  and  in  which 
will  be  found  the  greater  number  of  approved  models,  is  that 
made  up  by  A.  G.  Spalding  &  Bros. 

In  tennis  the  social  status  of  the  players  is  more  nearly  equal 
than  in  such  games  as  base  ball,  foot  ball,  etc.,  and  the  differ- 
ences in  prices  between  rackets  which  appear  to  the  unpracticed 
eye  as  very  much  alike  cannot  be  accounted  for  by  a  desire  of 
the  manufacturers  to  make  up  goods  to  suit  pocketbooks  of  var- 
ious sizes.  The  gradations  of  price  in  these  goods  occur  more 
particularly  on  account  of  some  detail  of  manufacture  which 
makes  the  more  costly,  at  the  same  time  the  more  suited,  to  the 
expert  player  than  the  cheaper  grades  on  which  the  same  amount 
of  labor  cannot  be  expended,  and  consequently  these  latter  do  not 
possess  the  same  nicety  of  balance  and  perfection  of  finish  which 
is  found  in  the  better  grades. 

The  selection  of  a  racket  is  something  that  the  player  should 
attend  to  personally.  Balance  and  weight  must  be  considered 
well  before  making  a  purchase,  and  much  care  should  be  exer- 
cised in  picking  out  a  racket  which  feels  good  to  handle,  not 
heavy  enough  to  appear  clumsy,  nor  light  enough  to  make  a  fast 
service  an  impossibility.  For  a  man  of  ordinary  strength  14  or 
14  1-2  ounces  will  generally  suit— seldom  heavier  than  this  and 
very  rarely  below.  The  wrist  is  the  determining  factor.  The 
handle  generally  preferred  is  the  combed  cedar  or  mahogany, 
which  is  just  rough  enough  to  give  a  good  grip. 

A  player  looking  for  the  nearest  approach  to  perfection  in  a 
tennis  racket    will    certainly    enthuse    over  the   Spalding  "  Gold 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNrS    ANNUAL.  167 

Medal,"  which  has  been  introduced  this  season.  The  Spalding 
expert  shape  has  been  taken  as  a  basis  and  various  methods  of 
stringing  have  been  tried  with  [the  object  of  getting  just  the 
happy  medium  of  firmness  and  resiliency  demanded.  The  frames 
are  made  of  absolutely  best  quality  white  ash,  finished  with  a  high 
polish  and  bound  at  shoulders  ;  throatpiece  is  of  polished  mahog- 
any and  handle  of  best  grade  mahogany,  either  5,  5  1-4  or  5  1-2 
inches,  combed ;  stringing  is  of  clearest  and  absolutely  best 
quality  lambs'  gut.  Each  racket  is  enclosed  in  a  mackintosh 
cover,  and  has  a  tag  attached  to  it  giving  particulars  of  inspection. 
The  price  of  the  Spalding  Gold  Medal  racket  is  $8.00,  and  with 
cane  handle  50  cents  extra. 

The  Spalding  Model  Rackets  are  modeled  after  those  used 
by  the  best  players  of  recent  years.  With  beveled  frame,  combed 
mahogany  handle  and  polished  mahogany  throatpiece,  Models  A 
and  D  cost  $6.00.  They  are  well  taped  at  bow,  and  in  finish  and 
quality  of  material  they  cannot  be  surpassed.  Model  C  costs 
$7.00  and  is  equipped  with  spliced  cane  handle  extending  through 
the  walnut  throatpiece,  but  otherwise  is  identical  in  quality  with 
Models  A  and  D.  Corresponding  with  these,  but  with  handles 
much  larger  to  suit  players  who  desire  them  so,  Models  AA,  DD 
and  CC  complete  the  line  of  Spalding  highest  quality  rackets,  on 
which  no  expense  has  been  spared  to  make  them  absolutely  the 
finest  in  material  and  workmanship  and  the  most  perfect  in  model 
of  any  so  far  produced. 

The  Spalding  Ocomo  costs  $5.00,  and  is  made  up  particularly 
for  ladies'  use.  It  is  made  of  finest  white  ash  with  rounded  edges, 
taped  bow  and  mahogany  throatpiece.  At  the  same  price  the 
Spalding  Tournament  is  sterling  value  and  will  give  excellent 
satisfaction.  The  next  mentioned  in  the  order  of  price  is  the 
Spalding  'Varsity  at  $4.00,  although  the  'Varsity  Cork  Handle  at 
$4.50  must  not  be  forgotten;  both  are  modeled  on  the  Expert 
Spalding  shape.  Popular  still,  although  the  model  is  not  approved 
by  some  of  the  newer  players,  the  Spalding  Slocum  at  $4.00  each 
and  the  Slocum  Junior  at  $3.00  each,  are  welcomed  by  players 
who  have  clung  to  this  game  through  its  various  vicissitudes 
as  they  do  to  this  model,  recognizing  in  both  sterling  qualities 
valuable  both  to  a  game  and  an  implement  of  play.

Beginners  may  want  rackets  cheaper  in  price  than  those  men- 
tioned above,  but  no  matter  what  price  is  paid  for  it,  value  com- 
mensurate with  price  is  found  in  all  which  bear  the  Spalding  trade 
mark.  The  Vantage  costs  $3.50,  the  Lakeside  $2.50,  both  well 
worth  the  price,  but  a  dollar's  difference  between  the  two.  After 
these  come  the  Greenwood  at  $2.00,  the  Geneva  at  $1.50  and  the 
Favorite  at  $1.00.  The  Practice  is  a  racket  for  children  and  costs 
75  cents. 

Take  good  care  of  your  racket  if  you  want  it  to  give  satisfaction. 
Remember,  it  is  strung  with  material  that  is  very  susceptible  to 
dampness,  and  when  it  breaks  do  not  always  blame  the  manufac- 
turer. Dry  heat  will  warp  the  frame,  too,  so  that  extremes  are 
to  be  avoided  in  the  atmosphere  of  the  room  or  closet  where  it  is 
kept,  and  if  play  is  continued  in  the  evening  until  the  dew  is  on 
the  ground,  or  if  court  is  near  the  sea,  it  is  well  to  rub  any 
moisture  off  the  stringing  with  a  cloth  before  putting  the  racket 
away  in  the  case.  If  no  case  is  in  your  possession,  a  press  should 
be  used  to  keep  the  frame  in  shape,  this  especially  so  at  tne  sea- 
shore. 

The  best  racket  case  is  the  Spalding  No.  5;  it  is  made  of  stiff 
leather,  holds  one  racket  and  costs  $5.00.  The  same,  but  made 
for  two  rackets,   is  the   Spalding  No.  7,  which  costs  $7.50.     A 


cravenette  cover,  positively  rainproof,  costs  $1.50.  A  very  good 
mackintosh  cover  costs  $1.00;  this  is  the  Spalding  No.  4.  One 
made  of  canvas,  leather  bound,  listed  as  Spalding's  No.  2,  costs 
75  cents,  while  their  No.  1,  made  of  soft  felt  in  a  variety  of  colors, 
costs  50  cents. 

By  far  the   most  practical  form  of   press  and  one  which  will 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.

\ff 


effectually  prevent  the  frame 
warping  is  the  shape  made  by 
Spalding  and  listed  as  No.  iR. 
It  costs  $1.00  each,  and  the 
same  style,  No.  2R,  made  to 
hold  two  rackets  cost  $2.00. 

Some  players  like  a  rubber 
covering  for  the  racket  handle 
to  secure  a  better  grip.  The 
Spalding  No.  3  costs  50  cents. 
It  is  made  of  pure  gum  rubber, 
corrugated,  and  will  give  excel- 
lent satisfaction. 
After  the  racket  has  been  in  use  for  a  season  or  so,  a  necessity 
will  very  likely  exist  for  restringing.  This  should  be  done  in 
the  proper  manner,  and  it  really  pays  in  the  end  to  have  some  re- 
liable firm  do  the  work  for  you.  Spalding  uses  three  different 
qualities  of  gut  for  restringing  and  the  prices  are  :  for  best  lambs' 
gut,  white,  red,  or  red  and  white,  $2.50  ;  lambs'  gut,  white,  red, 
or  red  and  white,  $1.50,  and  Oriental  gut,  white  only,  $1.00. 
Remember,  the  frame  of  a  racket  can  be  pulled  out  of  shape 
very  easily  by  an  inexperienced  person  in  stringing,  and  the 
same  rendered  absolutely  valueless  thereby.  Spalding  employs 
experts,  and  if  possible  the  racket  frame  is  improved  in  shape 
after  going  through  their  hands  rather  than  otherwise. 

When  you  purchase  tennis  balls,  you  do  so  perhaps  after  having 
played  with  those  a  friend  purchased.  His  judgment  may  guide 
you  in  selecting  the  brand,  but  at  any  rate  don't  rob  the  game  of 
half  its  good  points  by  purchasing  something  that  looks  like  what 
he  used,  but  the  similarity  of  which  does  not  go  below  the  felt 
cover.  The  best  grade  ball,  and  one  that  is  guaranteed  absolutely 
perfection,  is  the  Spalding  Championship  No.  00,  which  costs 
$4.00  per  dozen.  A  ball  of  uniform  quality,  carefully  constructed 
and  warranted  to  give  satisfaction,  is  the  Spalding  Tournament 
No.  o,  which  costs  $3.50  per  dozen.  A  cheaper  grade  of  felt- 
covered  ball  is  the-  Spalding  Vantage  at  $3.c  per  dozen.  This 
latter  will  do  for  practice.  -

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


Although  every  one  who  wishes  to  play  the  game  may  not 
have  a  place  to  play,  it  is  generally  possible  to  find  a  plot  of 
ground  which  can  be  arranged  suitably,  and  the  expense  of  im- 
proving same  and  keeping  it  in  good  order  borne  by  a  small 
circle  among  those  of  your  friends  who  wish  to  play.  If  this 
cannot  be  done,  the  would-be  player  can  generally  obtain  admit- 
tance to  some  already  organized  club,  while  in  some  of  the  larger 
cities  grounds  are  let  out  by  the  hour,  so  that  the  problem  of 
where  to  play  need  not  bother  the  aspirant  for  honors  on  the 
tennis  court  if  he  makes  an  effort  at  all  to  obtain  the  information. 
Presuming  that  you  have  found  a  suitable  plot  of  ground,  have  it 
worked  up  to  a  point  where  it  can  be  used  for  a  tennis  court. 
The  next  matter  to  consider  will  be  the  equipment  that  will  be 
necessary  to  fit  it  up  for  playing. 

The  poles  must  be  purchased  first.  They  are  made  in  a  num- 
ber of  styles  and  the  prices  range  from  one  to  twenty  dollars 
per  pair.  If  you  want  the  best,  most  decidedly  get  the  Spalding 
Championship  No.  A,  which  cost  $20.00  and  are  worth  every 
penny  of  the  price.  They  are  square  poles  of  3  3-8  inch  ash,  finely 
polished,  with  heavy  japanned  iron  bases  and  ratchet  crank  of 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


171 


special  design,  with  which  the  net  can  be  drawn  taut  when  it 
sags  in  the  middle.  An  iron  corkscrew  holds  the  pole  itself 
firmly  in  place,  being  fixed  permanently  in  the  ground  marking 
the  place  where  the  poles  should  be  set.  To  steady  them  in  case 
the  ground  is  soft,  iron  clutches  are  included  in  the  equipment 
furnished  with  them.  The  Spalding  Tournament  poles  No.  B 
cost  $10.00  per  pair.     The  pole  itself  is  made  of  square  2  3-4  inch 


Spalding's  Championship 
Tennis  Poles  with  Cork- 
screw and  Wedge  and 
Clutch   for  Soft  Ground. 


ash,  finely  finished,  and  the  base  of  heavy  japanned  iron,  a  ratchet 
crank  for  tightening  net  being  also  placed  on  this  pole.  Iron  pins 
for  fastening  the  bases  to  the  ground  are  packed  with  the  poles. 
A  style  that  is  absolutely  first  class  and  one  which  has  steadily 
increased  in  popularity  during  the  years  it  has  been  on  the  mar- 
ket, is  the  one  that  Spalding  lists  as  the  Casino  No.  C,  and  which 
costs  $6.00  per  pair.     They  are  round  poles,  have  heavy  japanned 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


173 


iron  bases  and  pins  for  fastening  to  the  ground,  together  with 
ratchet  crank  for  tightening  net.  If  poles  are  required  which  are 
to  be  left  up  permanently,  by  far  the  best  style  is  the  Spalding 
No.  DR,  which  costs  $5.00  per  pair.  They  have  an  iron  bracket 
brace  on  the  side  to  keep  them  firm  and  are  handsomely  painted, 
making  a  very  handsome  appearance;   these  are  inserted  30  inches

into  the  ground  and  need  no  guy  ropes  or  pegs;  a  reel  for  tighten- 
ing net  is  attached  to  post.  No.  DR  posts  are  same  as  No.  D, 
with  the  exception  that  they  have  no  reel  and  extend  only  18 
inches  into  the  ground.  The  Spalding  No.  E  poles  cost  $2.00  per 
pair.  They  are  finely  polished,  solid  and  spiked,  and  are  packed 
complete  with  guy  ropes  and  pegs.     For  $1.00  per  pair  you  can 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  175 

obtain  a  fair  quality  pole— the  Spalding  No.  F— also  complete  with 
guy  ropes  and  pegs. 

Now  as  to  the  net.  This  will  have  to  be  selected  according  to 
whether  you  have  a  double  or  single  court  to  fit  out.  Although 
the  Spalding  No.  I  measures  27  feet  and  costs  75  cents,  still,  even 
for  a  single  court,  it  will  be  well  to  pick  out  a  net  measuring 
36  feet.  The  cheaper  grades  are  machine  made  and  the  No.  2 
costs  $1.00.  A  double  court  net  42  feet  long,  of  same  grade  as 
these  other  two,  costs  $1.50.  It  is  a  question  whether  in  the 
long  run  it  is  not  better  to  get  a  good  quality  hand  made  net. 
It  is  also  important  to  have  it  bound  with  a  wide  strip  of  white 
canvas  at  the  top.  This  will  help  the  players  by  enabling  them  to 
see  the  top  of  the  net  at  a  glance.  Spalding's  No.  2B,  which 
measures  36  feet  and  is  made  of  21  thread  white  twine  and  can- 
vas bound,  hand-made  throughout,  costs  $3.00.  The  same  grade, 
but  42  feet  long— No.  3B— costs  $3.50.  Corresponding  to  these  in 
machine  made  nets  of  15  thread  twine,  the  36  foot  style,  No.  2A, 
costs  $2.00,  and  the  42  foot,  No.  3A,  $2.25.  The  Spalding  Inter- 
collegiate nets  have  given  excellent  satisfaction  and  are  very- 
popular.  They  are  hand  knit  of  21  thread  twine,  and  have  extra 
wide  white  canvas  strip  at  top.  This  style  and  quality  is  used  at 
Newport  and  all  championship  events.  No.  2E,  Intercollegiate, 
36  feet,  21  thread,  costs  $3.75,  and  the  same,  but  measuring  42 
ieet,  No.  3E,  costs  $4.25.  A  net  with  double  centre  should  be 
used  on  a  court  where  there  are  men  who  hit  the  ball  hard  and 
fast.  This  is  a  patented  feature  of  the  Spalding  nets.  The  No. 
2C  is  36  feet  long,  with  11  feet  of  15  thread  twine  double  knitted 
in  the  centre,  and  costs  $4.50  each.  No.  2D  is  the  same,  but  of 
21  thread  twine,  and  costs  $5.00  each.  No.  3C  costs  $5.00,  is  42 
feet  long  and  has  13  feet  of  15  thread  twine  double  knitted  in  the 
centre.  The  same,  but  of  21  thread  twine,  is  listed  as  Spalding's 
No.  3D  and  costs  $5.50. 

Where  it  is  not  convenient  to  take  the  net  in  every  night  it 
would  be  well  to  have  a  tarred  net.  They  are  especially  desirable 
where  net  is  subjected  to  the  action  of  the  salt  air.  No.  2-0  is 
canvas  bound,  36  feet  long,  and  is  made  of  21  thread  twine.  It 
will  withstand  the  elements  and  give  good  satisfaction  for  a  long 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.

time.  It  costs  $5.00.  The  same,  but  42  feet  long,  No.  3-0,  costs 
$6.00.  To  keep  the  centre  of  the  net  at  the  required  height  a 
strap  or  fork  should  be  used,  preferably  the  former,  as  there  is 
then  no  danger  of  the  ball  glancing  off  and  striking  out  of  court, 
as  is  occasionally  the  case  with  an  iron  centre  fork.  No.  3-0 
Centre  Strap  costs  $1.50  each,  is  Tournament  Pattern  and  has  a 
turnbuckle  with  which  height  of  net  can  be  adjusted  to  a  hair. 
No.  2-0  is  a  similar  style  and  costs  $1.00  each,  but  has  not  the 
turnbuckle  attachment.  Iron  cen- 
tre forks  are  made  in  two  styles  : 
No.  1,  regulation,  patent  stirrups, 
costs  $1.00,  and  No.  2,  an  or- 
dinary iron  fork,  costs  60  cents. 

For  4the  same  reason  that  it  is 
advisable  to  move  the  posts  from 
time  to  time  on  a  grass  court  in 
order  to  save  the  turf,  it  will 
also  be  necessary  to  have  some 
arrangements  for  marking  the 
lines  afresh  as  they  are  rubbed  or  washed  away.     The  Spalding

and  can  be  used  on  a  dirt  court 
with  marble  dust,  slacked 
lime,  etc.  Made  of  lighter 
metal,  it  can  be  bought 
for  $1.00.  The  Columbia 
tennis  marker  costs 
$5.00  and  is  suitable 
particularly  for  marking 
grass  courts.  It  has  a 
tank  to  hold  the  mark- 
ing solution  and  the 
tape  runs  over  the  wheel 
and  through  the  solu- 
tion giving  a  clean 
even  ribbon  line  with 
contact  in  full  view.

It  is  well  to  have  a  set  of  marking  plates  for  permanently  mark- 
ing the  angles  of  court.  They  are  sunk  to  the  level  of  the  court 
and  must  not  under  any  circumstances  protrude  above.  Spalding 
makes  two  styles:  No.  I,  with  separate  pins,  costs  $1.00  per  set; 
No.  2,  with  wedge  pins  attached,  $1.50  per  set.  Marking  tapes 
will  be  found  very  useful  and  particularly  convenient  where  one 
has  to  mark  out  the  court  himself.  Spalding's  No.  3  costs  $3.50 
per  set,  are  for  single  court,  and  come  complete  with  100  staples 

"J 


No.  2 

and  pins.  For  double  court  two  styles  are  made:  No.  4  costs  $4.00 
per  set,  complete  with  200  staples  and  14  pins;  No.  6  are  also  for 
double  court,  but  are  made  of  extra  quality  canvas  and  cost  $6.00 
per  set  complete.  In  each  set  the  tapes  are  cut  in  proper  lengths 
for  each  line  of  the  court,  and  the  staples  and  pins  furnished  are 
sufficient  to  secure  it  by  using  them  at  frequent  intervals. 

Backstop  nets  will  be  required  and  for  them  also  poles  of  suitable 
height.  Spalding's  BS  poles  cost  $1.00  each.  No.  4  net  measuring 
50  feet  long  by  7  feet  high  and  made  of  9-thread  twine,  costs  $2.50. 
No.  5  net,  50  feet  long  by  8  feet  high  and  12-thread  twine,  costs  $3.00. 
Both  of  these  are  white.  A  tarred  backstop  net  is  listed  as  No.  5X  and 
costs  $3.50.  It  is  50  feet  long,  8  feet  high  and  made  of  12-thread  twine. 

By  long  odds,  however,  the  finest  arrangement  for  a  portable 
backstop  that  has  so  far  been  placed  on  the  market  is  the  Spalding 
sectional  style  of  tubular  iron  uprights  and  cross  rods  with  gal- 
vanized iron  wire  netting.  Each  section  measures  9  feet  long 
by  7  feet  high,  and  is  hung  separately  so  as  to  permit  players  to 
pass  back  and  forth.  Six  sections  all  complete,  measuring  54  feet 
long  by  7  feet  high,  cost  $25.00  and  additional  sections  can  be  had 
at  proportionate  price.  For  fitting  up  a  court  complete,  perhaps 
more  than  one  set  may  be  required,  but  they  are  well  worth  the 
price  that  is  asked  for  them  and  will  add  considerably  to  the 
g^Tieral  appearance  of  the  court.

TETHER  TENNIS  GAME 

This  game  was  originally  introduced 
for  the  purpose  of  practicing  various 
strokes  at  lawn  tennis.  It  has  now- 
developed  into  a  game  having  special 
merits  of  its  own.  The  implements 
consist  of  an  upright  pole  standing  9 
or  10  feet  out  of  the  ground,  having  a 
line  marked  round  the  pole  6  feet 
from  the  ground.  Attached  to  the 
top  of  the  pole  is  a  piece  of  cord,  at 
the  end  of  which  is  fastened  a  lawn 


tennis  ball.  A  line  is 
ground  3  feet  from  the 
pole  on  opposite  sides 
of  it.  The  players 
stand  outside  this  line, 
using  an  ordinary 
lawn    tennis    racket. 


drawn  on  the 


Tether  Tennis  Ball  and  Pole  ready  f  cr  play. 
Cut  shows  marking-  ropes  in  position. 


The  game  is  to  wind  the  cord,  with  the  ball  attached,  round 
the  pole  and  above  the  line.  The  game  is  usually  started  by 
tossing  for  service.  The  winner  then  takes  the  ball  in  his 
hand,  and  with  the  racket  drives  it  round  the  pole;  the  oppo- 
nent stops  the  progress  of  the  ball  and  endeavors  to  drive  it 
back  again,  and  round  the  pole  in  the  opposite  direction.  The 
player  getting  the  ball  round  the  pole  and  above  the  line  wins 
the  game.  A  set  is  usually  the  best  of  eleven  games.  The 
service  may  either  be  taken  alternately  or  continuously  until 
the  server  loses  a  game.

MALLETS 


IN  the  matter  of  mallets  we  are  able  to  satisfy 
the  ambitious  desires  of  the  most  finical.  Our 
ordinary  mallets,  with  prices,  are  given  else- 
where, but  we  can  furnish  the  best  mallets,  made 
under  the  personal  supervision  of  Charles  Jacobus, 
who  has  adopted  new  points  in  making  that  cannot 
be  equalled.  The  prices  are  according  to  quality 
and  material,  from  $7.50  to  $25.00.  The  diameters 
of  mallets  are  now  smaller  than  formerly,  and  the 
woods  are  heavy  tropical  woods,  with  bronze  or  steel 
bands;  all  made  with  one  end  hard  rubber  and  one 
end  soft,  and  all  are  guaranteed  in  workmanship 
against  all  harm,  except  of  ordinary  wear  from 
proper  strokes  and  fair  usage.  A  mallet  is  made 
to  hit  the  ball  only;  the  arches  are  steel,  and  it  is 
not  conducive  to  the  condition  of  mallets  to  strike 
arches  instead  of  balls.  The  heads  may  be  of 
granadilla,  satinwood,  snakewood,  cocobolo  or 
some  other  excellent  wood.  The  handle  may  be 
checkered,  plain,  uniform  tapering,  and  of  any 
diameter  to  suit  the  player.  They  may  have  steel 
shanks,  with  ivory  set  in  on  opposite  sides,  and 
the  bands  may  be  plain  bronze  or  nickeled,  or 
silvered  bronze  or  steel.  The  length  of  head  and 
handle  should  be  given,  with  desired  weight. 
"A  thing  of  beauty  is  a  joy  forever"  applies  to  a 
mallet   made   in   the   style   that    we    can    furnish.

THen  Hinutes'  Exercise 

Dr.  Luth^Guiickfor  Busy  Hen 

Dr.  Guliek  says:  "The  experi- 
ence of  years  has  demonstrated  the 
efficiency  of  the  exercises  contained 
in  '  Ten  Minutes'  Exercise  for  Busy 
Men  '  in  securing  the  ends  for  w  Inch 
they  were  devised.  Many  letters 
have  been  written  by  men,  testifying 
to  the  great  benefit  which  they  have 
secured  from  these  few  minutes  of 
simple  but  vigorous  work. 

»,  *  *  *  The  correspondence 
schools  of  physical  training  have 
come  into  great  activity.  Their 
general  aim  is  to  build  up  big  mus- 
cles: A  somewhat  careful  investi- 
gation of  them  satisfies  me  that  they 
are  inferior  to  the  exercises  in  this 
drill  for  purposes  of  building  up 
vigor  and  manliness. 

"One  of  the  most  vigorous  claims 
of  some  of  these  schools,  namely, 
that  the  heart  particularly  is  bene- 
fited by  their  work,  is  false,  for  I 
have  had  case  after  case  of  men 
whose  hearts  have  been  injured  by 
taking  the  correspondence  schools' 
work  when  they  were  not  in  condi- 
tion for  it. 

"  The  exercises  in  «  Ten  Minutes' 
Exercise  for  Busy  Men  '  are  recom- 
mended with  the  confidence  of  long, 
successful  use.  The  results  secured 
are  better  than  those  possible  from 
the  correspondence  school  work  in 
the  specific  directions  mentioned."

HOW  TO  BECOME  A  BOXER 

For  many  years  publications  have 
been  issued  on  the  art  of  boxing  that 
to  a  certain  extent  did  not  enable  the 
"ovice  nor  the  youth  to  become  pro- 
ficient in  the  manly  art.  There  is 
probably  no  man  in  America  better 
qualified  to  teach  boxing  than  Prof. 
William  Elmer,  and  in  his  book  on 
the  subject  he  goes  into  it  very  ex- 
haustively. The  book  contains  about 
seventy  full  page  illustrations,  show- 
ing how  each  blow  is  to  be  made, 
how  to  attack  and  how  to  defend 
yourself.  It  shows  how  the  hands 
must  be  held  and  the  positions  to 
take,  with  descriptions  that  are  so 
accurate  that  any  boy  can  take  them, 
open  them  up  and  with  a  young  friend 
become  proficient.  Besides  being  a 
fully  illustrated  book  on  the  art  of 
self-defence,  it  contains  nearly  all 
the  photographs  of  the  leading  Amer- 
ican boxers  and  the  positions  they 
take,  which  in  itself  is  instructive  ; 
the  different  rules  under  which  all 
contests  are  held,  and  articles  which 
will  interest  anyone  on  the  question 
of  physical  education.  In  order  to 
make  this  publication  the  most  ac- 
curate one  issued,  Prof.  Elmer  had 
his  sparring  partner  posed  personally 
for  all  the  illustrations.

The  Spalding   Patent 
Solid    Striking    Bag   Disks 


Patent  Pending 


THE_  solid  disk  for 
I  striking  bags  will 
always  hold  a  high  place 
in  the  estimation  of 
many  on  account  of  the 
variety  of  work  it  per- 
mits. ^  The  style  which 
we  originally  introduced 
some  years  ago  is  the 
one  which  has  been  imi- 
tated most  generally, 
but  in  all  these  substi- 
tutes the  makers,  while 
making  them  lighter, 
have  uniformly  ne- 
glected the  most  essen- 
tial point  and  have 
produced  a  n  article 
flimsy  and  unsatisfac- 
tory to  a  degree. 

A  striking  bag  disk 
must  be  substantial  if  it 
is  to  be  of  use,  and  in 
the  various  styles,  both 
adjustable  and  braced, 
this  feature  has  not  been 
neglected, while  we  have 
striven  to  put  out  a  disk 
which  is  suitable  for 
home  use  and  moderate 
in  price. 


ADJUSTABLE  STYLE 

Similar  to  No.  AR,  except  the  inflated  feature. 
No.  CR.    Complete,  without  bag.     .       .     Each,  $7.50 

Handsomely  illustrated  catalogue  mailed  free  to  any  address.
