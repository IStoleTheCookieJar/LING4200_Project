ROUNDING Estimates of monthly change shown on page 1 have been calculated using unrounded 
estimates, and may be different from, but are more accurate than, movements 
obtained from the rounded estimates. The graphs on page 1 also depict movements 


calculated from unrounded estimates. 


ee 


SAMPLING ERRORS The estimates in this publication are based on a sample survey. Because the entire 
population is not enumerated, the published estimates and the movements derived 
from them are subject to sampling variability. Standard errors give a measure of this 


variability and appear on pages 40 and 41. 


The 95% confidence intervals below provide another way of looking at the varnability 
inherent in estimates fram sample surveys. The interval bounded by the two limits 1s 
the 95% confidence interval. A 95% confidence interval indicates that we are 95% 


confident that the upper and lower hmits enclose the true value of the estimate.

EXPLANATORY NOTES 


2 ee i ee ee ee 


INTRODUCTION L This publication contains preliminary estimates of the civilian labour force 
derived from the Labour Force Survey component of the monthly population 
survey. Estimates for the current month are preliminary and subject to revision. 
Revised estimates for the current month and more detailed estimates will be 
published in Labour Force, Australia (6203.0). 


MONTHLY POPULATION SURVEY 2 The popuiation survey is based on a multi-stage area sample of private 
dwellings (currently about 30,000 houses, flats, etc.) and a list sarnple of 
non-private dwellings Chotels, motels, etc.), and covers about 0.5% of the 
population of Australia. The information is obtained from the occupants of 
selected dweilings by specially trained interviewers. The interviews are generally 
conducted during the two weeks beginning on the Monday between the 6th and 
12th of each month. The information cbtained relates to the week before the 


interview (i.e. the reference week),

TELEPHONE INTERVIEWING 3 The ABS has introduced the use of telephone interviewing into the Labour 
Force Survey. Households selected for the Labour Force Survey are interviewed 
each month for 8 months, with one eighth of the sample being replaced each 
month. The first interview will continue to be conducted face-to-face. Subsequent 
interviews will then be conducted by telephone (if acceptable to the 
respondent). Telephone interviewing was phased in for each new sample group 
from August 1996 to February 1997. 


4 During the period of implementation, the new method produced different 
estimates than would have been obtained under the old methodology. The effect 
peaked in November 1996, when it is estimated that the published estimate of 
total employment was about 36,000 to 48,000 lower than would have been 
measured under the old methodology. The effect dissipated over the final 
months of implementation and was no longer discernible from February 1997. 
Therefore, the estimates for February 1997 and onwards are directly comparable 
ta estimates for periods prior to August 1996. 


SCOPE OF SURVEY § The Labour Force Survey includes all persons aged 15 and over except 
members of the permanent defence forces, certain diplomatic personnel of 
overseas governments customarily excluded from census and estimated 
populations, overseas residents in Australia, and members of non-Australian 
defence forces (and their dependants) stationed in Australia. 





| COVERAGE _ § Inthe Labour Force Survey, coverage rules are applied which aim to ensure 
that each person is associated with only one dwelling, and hence has only one 
chance of selection. The coverage rules are necessarily a balance between 
theoretical and operational considerations. Nevertheless, the chance of a person 
being enumerated at two separate dwellings in the survey is considered to be 
negligible. 


POPULATION BENCHMARKS ¢ Labour Force Survey estimates are calculated in such a way as to add up to 

independent estimates of the civilian population aged 15 and over (population 
fi benchmarks). From February 1994, labour force estimates have been compiled 
using benchmarks based on the results of the 1991 Census of Population and 
Housing. Small revisions were made to many of the historical estimates from 
January 1989 to January 1994. 


REVISION OF SERIES § From April 1986, the definition of employed persons was changed to include 

persons who worked without pay berween 1 and 14 hours per week in a family 
a business or on a farm (i.¢. contributing family workers). For further information, 
7 see paragraphs 36 and 37 of the Explanatory Notes to the February 1987 issue of 
The Labour Force, Australia (6203.0).

SURVEY SAMPLE REDESIGN 9 The Labour Force Survey sample was redesigned and reselected using 
information collected in the 1991 Census of Population and Housing. The new 
sample was phased in over the period September to December 1992. For details, 
see Information Paper: Labour Force Survey Sample Design (6269.0). 


10 For the most part, one quarter of the new sample was introduced each 
month so that, by December 1992, the entire new sample was in place. 
Replacement generally occurred at the rotation group level with two groups 
being substituted each month. Such a pattern of implementation meant that any 
changes to labour force estimates due to differences between the two samples, 
or any other influences, were spread over the four months rather than being 
concentrated in one inter-month period. 


11. This phase-in scheme applied to the private dwelling sample in urban areas. 
The new sample for non-private dwellings and pnvate dwellings in tural areas was 
introduced in a single stage in November 1992. 


RELIABILITY OF ESTIMATES 12 Two types of error are possible in an estimate based on a sample survey: 
sampling error and non-sampling error. 


Sampling error occurs because a sample, rather than the entire population, is 
surveyed. One measure of the likely difference resulting from not including all 
dwellings in the survey is piven by the standard error. There are about two 
chances in three vhat a sample estimate will differ by less than one standard error 
from the figure that would have been obtained if all dwellings had been included 
in the survey, and about nineteen chances in twenty that the difference will bce 
fess than two standard errors. Standard errors of estimates for the latest month 
and of estimates of movements since the previous month are shown on pages 30 
and 31. Standard errors of other estimates and other movements may be 
determined by using information in the Technical Notes in Labour Force, 
Australia (6203.0). 


Non sampling error arises from inaccuracics in collecting, recording and 
processing the data. Every effort is made to minimise reporting error by the 
careful design of questionnaires, intensive training and supervision of 
interviewers, and efficient data processing procedures. 


SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT AND 13 Seasonally adjusted series are published in Tables 2, 5 and 12 to 17. Scasonal 

TREND ESTIMATION factors are reviewed annually to take account of each additional year's onginal 
data. The results of the latest review were used to compile the revised seasonally 
adjusted and trend estimates given in this publication. Information about the 
method of adjustment and revised seasonally adjusted and trend estimates for all 
months from January 1995 were published in a feature article in the February 
1997 issue of Labour Force, Australia (6203.0). 


14 Seasonal adjustment is a means of removing the estimated effects of normal 
seasonal variation from the series so that the effects of other influences on the 
series can be more clearly recognised. Seasonal adjustment does not aim to 
remove the irregular or non-seasonal influences which may be present in any 
particular month, This means that month-to-month movements of the seasonally 
adjusted estimates may not be reliable indicators of trend behaviour. For 
example, irregular factors unrelated to the trend account for more than half the 
seasonally adjusted movement with the following frequency: 


Employment: 9 in 10 monthly movements 
Unemployment: 7 in 10 monthly movements 


Unemployment rate: 7 in 10 monthly movements 
Participation rate: 9 in 10 monthly mavements

UNPUBLISHED STATISTICS 


EFFECTS OF ROUNDING 


SYMBOLS AND OTHER USAGES 


15 The smocthing of seasonally adjusted series reduces the impact of the 
irregular component of the seasonally adjusted series, and creates trend 
estimates. These trend estimates are derived by applying a 13-term 
Henderson-weighted moving average to all months except the last six. The last 
six monthly trend estimates are obtained by applying surrogates of the 
Henderson average to the seasonally adjusted series. Trend series are used to 
analyse the underlying behaviour of the series over time. These are published in 
Tables 3, 6 and 12 to 19. 


16 While this smoothing technique enables estimates to be produced for the 
latest month, it does result in revisions to the most recent months as additional 
observations become availabie. Generally, subsequent revisions become smaller, 
and after three months have a negligible impact on the series. There will also be 
revisions as a result of the annual review of seasonal factors. 


17 Trend estimates are published for the Northem Territory in Table 18 and for 
the Australian Capital Territory in Table 19. Unadjusted series for the two 
Territories have shown, historically, a high degree of variability, which can lead to 
considerable revisions to the seasonally adjusted estimates after each annual 
seasonal factor re-analysis. Seasonally adjusted estimates are not currently 
published! for the nwo Territories. The most recent six months trend estimates 
are subject to revision. For the three most recent months, the revision may be 
relatively large. Inferences about trends drawn from smoothed seasonally 
adjusted (trend) estimates for months earlier than the latest three months are 
unlikely to be affected by month ta month revisions. They may be affected by 
revision resulting from the annual re-analysis of seasonal factors.

Donna Maurer on GG 252 6525 or to any ABS office. 


22 Estimates have been rounded and discrepancies may occur between sums of 
the component items and totals. 


23 Estimates of movement shown in this publication are obtained by taking the 
difference of unrounded estimates. The movement estimate is then rounded to 
one decimal place. Therefore where a discrepancy occurs between the reported 
movement and the difference of the rounded estimates, the reported movement 
will be more accurate.

The estimates in this publication are based on information gained from the occupants 
ofa sample survey of dwellings. Because the entire population is not surveyed, the 
published estimates are subject to sampling error. The most common way of 
quantifying such sampling error is to calculate the standard error for the published 


estimate or statistic. 


To illustrate, let us say the published level estimate for employed persons aged 15 to 19 

is 500,000. The calculated standard error in this case is 9,000, The standard error is 

then used to interpret the level estimate of $00,000. For instance, the standard error of 

9,000 indicates that: 

® There are approximately two chances in three that the real value falls within the 
range 491,000 to 509,000 (500,000 + or — 9,000) 


« There are approximately nineteen chances in twenty that the real valuc falls 
within the range 482,000 to 518,000 (500,000 + or — 18,000) 


The real value in this case is the result we would obtain if we could enumerate the total 
population. 


The following tables show the standard errors for this month's level estimates.

MOVEMENT ESTIMATES The following example illustrates how to use the standard error to interpret a 
movement estimate. Let us say that one month the published level estimate for females 
employed part time in Australia is 1,387,000; che next month che published level 
estimate is 1,400,000. The calculated standard error for the movement estimate is 
10,500, The standard error is then used to interpret the published movement estimate 
of 13,000, For instance, the standard error of 10,500 indicates that: 

a There are approximately two chances in three that the rea] movement over the 
two month period falls within the range 2,500 to 23,500 (13,000 + or — 10,5005 


« There are approximately nineteen chances in twenty that the real movement falls 
within the range —8,000 to 34,000 (13,000 + or — 21,000). 


The following tables show the standard errors for this month's movement estimates.

EFFECT OF NEW SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ESTIMATES ON TREND ESTIMATES 


Each time new seasonally adjusted estimates become available, trend estimates are 
revised (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of Explanatory Notes). 


TREND REVISIONS The examples in the tables below show four illustrative scenarios and the consequent 
revisions to previous trend estimates of employment and unemployment rate. 


1 The May seasonally adjusted estimate is the same as the April estimate. 


2 The May seasonally adjusted estimate is higher than the April estimate by: 
# +0.33% for employment 
a) +2.2% for the unemployment rate 

3 The May seasonally adjusted estimate is lower than the April estimate by: 
# ~0.33% for employment 
mg —2.2% forthe unemployment rate 


4 The May seasonally adjusted estimate results in a revised April trend estimate which 
is identical to the new May trend cstimate. 


The percentage changes of 6.33% and 2.2% were chosen because they represent the 
average absolute manthly percentage changes in employment and the unemployment 
rate respectively,
