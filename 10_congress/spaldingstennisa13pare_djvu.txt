Spalding's 
Athletic  Library 

Anticipating  the  present  ten- 
dency of  the  American  people 
toward  a  healthful  method  of  living: 
and  enjoyment,  Spalding's  Athletic 
Library  was  established  in  1892  for 
the  purpose  of  encouraging  ath- 
letics in  every  form,  not  only  by 
publishing  the  official  rules  and 
records  pertaining  to  the  various 
pastimes,  but  also  by  instructing, 
until  to-day  Spalding's  Athletic 
Library  is  unique  in  its  own  par- 
ticular field  and  has  been  conceded 
the  greatest  educational  series  on 
athletic  and  physical  training  sub- 
jects that  has  ever  been  compiled. 
The  publication  of  a  distinct 
series  of  books  devoted  to  athletic 
sports  and  pastimes  and  designed 
to  occupy  the  premier  place  in 
America  in  its  class  was  an  early 
idea  of  Mr.  A.  G.  Spalding,  who 
was  one  of  the  first  in  America 
to  publish  a  handbook  devoted  to 
athletic  sports,  Spalding's  Official 
Base  Ball  Guide  being  the  initial 
number,  which  was  followed  at  intervals  with  other  handbooks  on  the 
sports  prominent  in  the  '70s. 

Spalding's  Athletic  Library  has  had  the  advice  and  counsel  of  Mr.  A,  G. 
Spalding  in  all  of  its  undertakings,  and  particularly  in  all  books  devoted 
to  the  national  game.  This  applies  especially  to  Spalding's  Official 
Base  Ball  Guide  and  Spalding's  Official  Base  Ball  Record,  both  of  which 
receive  the  personal  attention  of  Mr.  A.  G.  Spalding,  owing  to  his  early 
connection  with  the  game  as  the  leading  pitcher  of  the  champion  Boston 
and  Chicago  teams  of  1872-76.  His  interest  does  not  stop,  however,  with 
matters  pertaining  to  base  ball;  there  is  not  a  sport  that  Mr.  Spalding 
does  not  make  it  his  business  to  become  familiar  with,  and  that  the 
Library  will  always  maintain  its  premier  place,  with  Mr.  Spalding's  able 
counsel  at  hand,  goes  without  saying. 

The  entire  series  since  the  issue  of  the  first  number  has  been  under 
the  direct  personal  supervision  of  Mr.  James  E.  Sullivan,  President 
of  the  American  Sports  Publishing  Company,  and  the  total  series  of 
consecutive  numbers  reach  an  aggregate  of  considerably  over  three 
hundred,  included  in  which  are  many  "annuals,"  that  really  constitute 
the  history  of  their  particular  sport  in  America  year  by  year,  back  copies 
of  which  are  even  now  eagerly  sought  for,  constituting  as  they  do  the 
really  first  authentic  records  of  events  and  official  rules  that  have  ever 
been  consecutively  compiled. 

When  Spalding's  Athletic  Library  was  founded,  seventeen  years  ago, 
track  and  field  athletics  were  practically  unknown  outside  the  larger 
colleges  and  a  few  athletic  clubs  in  the  leading  cities,  which  gave  occa- 
sional meets,  when  an  entry  list  of  250  competitors  was  a  subject  of  com- 
ment; golf  was  known  only  by  a  comparatively  few  persons;  lawn  tennis 
bad  some  vrogue  and  base  ball  was  practically  the  only  established  field

sport,  and  that  in  a  professional  way;  basket  ball  had  just  been  invented; 
athletics  for  the  schoolboy— and  schoolgirl— were  almost  unknown,  and 
an  advocate  of  class  contests  in  athletics  in  the  schools  could  not  get  a 
hearing.  To-day  we  find  the  greatest  body  of  athletes  in  the  world  is 
the  Public  Schools  Athletic  League  of  Greater  New  York,  which  has  had 
an  entry  list  at  its  annual  games  of  over  two  thousand,  and  in  whose 
"elementary  series"  in  base  ball  last  year  106  schools  competed  for  the 
trophy  emblematic  of  the  championship. 

While  Spalding's  Athletic  Library  cannot  claim  that  the  rapid  growth 
of  athletics  in  this  country  is  due  to  it  solely,  the  fact  cannot  be  denied 
that  the  books  have  had  a  great  deal  to  do  with  its  encouragement,  by 
printing  the  official  rules  and  instructions  for  playing  the  various  games 
at  a  nominal  price,  within  the  reach  of  everyone,  with  the  sole  object 
that  its  series  might  be  complete  and  the  one  place  where  a  person 
could  look  with  absolute  certainty  for  the  particular  book  in  which  he 
might  be  interested.  „       ,  .         ,      i       ^,      ,     j 

In  selecting  the  editors  and  writers  for  the  various  books,  the  lead- 
ing authority  in  his  particular  line  has  been  obtained,  with  the  result 
that  no  collection  of  books  on  athletic  subjects  can  compare  with 
Spalding's  Athletic  Library  for  the  prominence  of  the  various  authors 
and  their  ability  to  present  their  subjects  in  a  thorough  and  practical 
manner.  ,      ,  t^   j  j.  . t.     i     j

WALTER   CAMP 

For  quarter  of  a  century  Mr.  Walter  Camp 
of  Yale  has  occupied  a  leading  position  in  col- 
lege athletics.  It  is  immaterial  what  organiza- 
tion is  suggested  for  college  athletics,  or  for 
the  betterment  of  conditions,  insofar  as  college 
athletics  is  concerned.  Mr.  Camp  has  always 
played  an  important  part  in  its  conferences, 
and  the  great  interest  in  and  high  plane  of 
college  sport  to-day,  are  undoubtedly  due  more 
to  Mr,  Camp  than  to  any  other  individual.  Mr. 
Camp  has  probably  written  more  on  college 
athleticb  than  any  other  writer  and  the  leading  papers  and  maga- 
zines of  America  are  always  anxious  to  secure  his  expert  opinion  on  foot 
ball,  track  and  field  athletics,  base  ball  and  rowing.  Mr.  Camp  has  grown 
up  with  Yale  athletics  and  is  a  part  of  Yale's  remarkable  athletic  system. 
While  he  has  been  designated  as  the  "Father  of  Foot  Ball,"  it  is  a  well 
known  fact  that  during  his  college  career  Mr.  Camp  was  regarded  as  one 
of  the  best  players  that  ever  represented  Yale  on  the  base  ball  field,  so 
when  we  hear  of  Walter  Camp  as  a  foot  ball  expert  we  must  also  remem- 
ber his  remarkable  knowledge  of  the  game  of  base  ball,  of  which  he  is  a 
great  admirer.  Mr.  Camp  has  edited  Spalding's  Official  Foot  Ball  Guide 
since  it  was  first  published,  and  also  the  Spalding  Athletic  Library  book 
on  How  to  Play  Foot  Ball.  There  is  certainly  no  man  in  American  college 
life  better  qualified  to  write  for  Spalding's  Athletic  Library  than  Mr. 
Camp. 


DR.  LUTHER   HALSEY  GULICK

his  good  work  and  had  many  honors  conferred

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  5 

The   Davis   Cup   Matches 

On  October  8,  Maurice  E.  McLoughlin  and  Melville  H.  Long  left  Van- 
couver for  their  long  journey  to  Australia  in  quest  of  the  Davis  Cup.  As 
in  past  years  the  burden  of  defending  their  country's  honors  fell  upon 
the  shoulders  of  N.  E.  Brookes  and  A.  F.  Wilding,  and  it  was  for  the 
seemingly  hopeless  task  of  defeating  those  great  players  that  the  nineteen- 
year-old  youths  from  the  Far  West  undertook  a  journey  extending  half 
way  round  the  world.  They  arrived  at  Brisbane  on  November  i,  and  two 
days  later,  in  company  with  Dr.  F.  G.  Brathwaite,  Vice-Consul  of  the 
United  States,  they  reached  Sydney.  On  the  day  of  their  arrival  an 
official  reception  was  held  at  the  Hotel  Australia,  at  which  the  president 
of  the  Lawn  Tennis  Association  of  Australia,  Mr.  P.  B.  Coquhoun,  pre- 
sided. Many  prominent  men,  both  in  tennis  circles  and  in  civic  life 
were  guests.  Among  them  were  Dr.  Brathwaite,  W.  P.  Dunlop,  president 
of  the  New  South  Wales  Association,  and  the  Honorable  C.  W .  Oakes, 
Honorary  Minister  of  the  Crown;  the  executive  committee  of  the  Australian 
Association,  the  Committee  of  Management,  and  many  prominent  State 
players,  were  also  in  attendance.  The  usual  official  welcome,  complimentary 
references  to  the  former  team  of  Alexander  and  Wright,  speeches,  etc., 
followed.  The  health  of  the  visitors  was  then  drunk  with  musical  honors. 
Dr.  Brathwaite  replied,  and  Mr.  Long  added  an  acknowledgment,  but 
efforts   to   induce    McLoughlin    to   speak   were   in   vain. 

Quarters  for  the  players  were  then  procured  by  Dr.  Brathwaite  at  the 
Royal  Sydney  Golf  Club,  situated  at  Rose  Bay,  and  within  half  an  hour's 
ride  from  the  city.  Everything  possible  was  done  by  the  doctor  for  their 
comfort,  and  in  addition,  a  very  fair  grass  court  was  available  for  practice. 
Later  on  a  court  was  prepared  at  the  Double  Bay  ground,  on  which  the 
matches  were  to  be  played,  and  it  was  there  that  most  of  their  practice 
was  done,  until  within  a  week  of  the  date  of  play,  when  their  work  was 
transferred  to  the  Davis  Cup  court  itself.  Unlike  Wright  and  Alexander, 
the  boys  decided  not  to  take  part  in  the  Victorian  championships,  prefer- 
ring  to    prepare    quietly    in    Sydney    for    the    coming   struggle. 

Much  public  interest  was  taken  in  the  practice  games  when  they  were 
begun  at  the  Double  Bay  grounds.  Naturally,  there  was  much  criticism 
of  the  Americans'  play,  but  later  events  proved  conclusively  that  the 
challengers  were  never  seen  at  anything  like  their  best  until  the  matches 
actually    began. 

The  dates  set  for  the  Cup  matches  were  Friday,  Saturday  and  Monday, 
November  26,  2^  and  29.  All  arrangements  for  the  opening  day  had 
been  completed  and  the  people  began  to  arrive.  At  noon  th  seats  were 
occupied  here  and  there  and  by  one  o'clock  the  great  stands  were  fairly 
well  filled  up.  That  was  in  spite  01  the  fact  that  play  was  advertised 
to  begin  not  before  two  o'clock.  The  beautiful  court,  with  the  fenced 
in  space  around  it,  measured  100x84  feet.  The  low  green  canvas  side 
and  backstops,  the  great  stands  with  their  capacity  for  more  than  5,000 
spectators — all  were  in  readiness,  when  suddenly  the  sky  darkened,  a 
deep  rumble  of  distant  thunder  followed,  and  then  the  storm  broke. 
The  downpour  continued  for  over  two  hours,  the  Davis  Cup  court  was 
submerged  in  water,  and,  of  course,  the  matches  were  out  of  the  question. 
Refunds  were  handed  to  hundreds  of  bedraggled  spectators,  for  there  was 
no  adequate  protection  against  such  an  emergency  and  few  escaped  a 
drenching,  and  it  was  decided  to  run  the  matches  in  the  intended  order; 
first  the  singles,  the  doubles  to  follow,  and  on  the  third  day,  the  remain- 
ing   two    single    matches;    all,    of    course,    a    day    later. 

A  strong  southerly  breeze  blew  all  Friday  night,  and  Saturday  dawned 
dull  and  cloudy.  Fortunately,  there  was  no  more  rain,  and  before  the 
time  scheduled  for  the  beginning  of  the  struggle  nearly  five  thousand 
people  had  their  seats.  It  was  a  bright,  inspiring  spectacle.  Ladies  in 
their    variety    of    colors    were    present    in    large    numbers.     The    ball    boys. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  7 

four  in  number,  dressed  in  white,  the  cinematograph  operator,  and  the 
reporters  in  their  press  stand  were  settled,  when  the  referee,  Mr.  ColqU' 
houn,  Mr.  T.  H.  Hicks,  the  Honorary  Secretary,  and  the  players  entered 
the  enclosure  to  the  accompaniment  of  a  perfect  storm  of  applause.  Mr, 
F.  A-  Waller,  the  umpire,  ascended  the  chair;  the  linesmen,  Messrs.  Alf 
Roberts.  Rowley  Turner,  Bunting,  Carr,  Turton,  W.  A.  Clark,  Wardell, 
A.  Campbell,  Howell  and  Dr._  Bowker,  took  their  positions,  and  at  ten 
minutes  after  two  o'clock  Captains  Brookes  and  McLoughlin  took  the  court. 
After  a  preliminary  knockup,  McLoughlin  won  the  toss  and  started  to 
serve.  The  hundreds  of  cameras  in  evidence  among  the  crowd  were  directed 
on  the  men,  and  the  battle  had   begun. 

The  contrast  in  the  men  was  very  noticeable.  Brookes'  face  was  as 
usual,  pale  and  expressionless,  and  his  movements  always  quiet  and  un- 
noticeable.  McLoughlin  was  nervous  energy  and  activity  personified,  and 
varying   emotions   were    reflected   in    his   ever    changing   expressions. 

McLoughlin's  first  delivery  was  a  fast  straight  ball,  which  Brookes  re- 
turned weakly,  but  the  American  misplayed  an  easy  volley.  Brooks  had 
won  the  opening  point,  and  the  crowd  applauded  the  incident,  though  not 
the  play  that  gave  jt  to  liim.  From  the  beginning  of  the  match  it  was 
apparent  that  the  visitor  intended  to  follow  the  tactics  of  Wright  in  his 
match  of  1908  with  Brookes,  and  make  abundant  use  of  the  lob. 
But  Brookes  was  in  rare  form  overhead,  and  though  he  never  smashed 
hard,  his  blocking  was  true  and  well  placed.  He  kept  McLoughlin  con- 
stantly on  the  run  and  often  caught  him  on  the  wrong  foot.  The  first 
set  was  fast,  but  after  the  first  game,  always  in  favor  of  Brookes. 
McLoughlin  won  the  opening  game,  but  the  Australian  captain  ran  out 
the  following  three.  McLoughlin  then  won  his  service  for  the  second 
game,  and  Brookes  again  took  three  in  succession,  ihroughout  the  set 
the  American  lobbed  a  great  deal,  but  Brookes,  though  his  returns  were 
slow,  placed  them  cleverly  and  usually  took  the  ^oint.  The  latter  played 
steadily  and  constantly  employed  a  slow,  lift  drive  that  dropped  auickly 
and  usually  at  McLoughlin's  feet.  It  was  his  most  effective  stroke,  though. 
in  service  and  volleying  he  was  almost  as  good.  During  the  set  McLough- 
lin netted  far  too  many  volleys,  and  his  hard  drive  flew  out  or  netted 
oftener  than  it  reached  its  goal.  Once  he  lost  a  point  by  a  foot-iault,  but 
the  penalty  served  as  a  warning,  and  he  was  not  reprimanded  again.  Over- 
head he  was  splendidly  accurate  and  severe,  and  he  volleyed  from  his 
forehand  with  fine  control.  His  service  was  as  usual  very  strong,  though 
Brookes'  delivery  had  equal  speed  and  his  first  ball  went  in  much  oftener. 

The  order  of  the  games  in  the  second  set  was  a  duplicate  of  the  first. 
McLoughlin  won  his  service  in  the  first  and  again  in  the  fifth  games^ 
with  Brookes  winning  the  rest.  The  tallies  for  the  American  both  touched 
deuce,  but  Brookes'  games  were  divided — 3  to  love  and  3  to  15.  It  was 
during  this  set  that  Brookes  played  his  best.  His  variety,  and  changes  of 
pace  were  charming,  and  McLoughlin,  for  the  time  being,  was  greatly  out- 
classed. 

In  the  third  set  McLoughlin,  for  the  first  time,  brought  into  use  his 
heavy  reverse  twist  service,  and  it  puzzled  the  Australian  immensely. 
McLoughlin  took  his  game  to  30;  Brookes  did  likewise  with  the  second 
game,  but  the  third  was  full  of  exciting  incidents.  On  one  occasion, 
"Mac"  took  a  point  on  a  terrific  underhand  cut,  which  made  the  ball, 
after  striking  in  Brookes'  court,  bound  backward  over  the  net.  On  an- 
other, Brookes  slipped  and  fell  heavily  in  trying  to  reach  a  well  placed 
service.  Finally,  the  game  went  to  the  visitor  by  8/6.  Brookes  then  won 
three  games,  all  to  15,  by  splendid  short  drives  and  good  lobs;  or,  as  they 
say  in  Australia,  "tosses,"  that  kept  McLoughlin  from  the  net.  At  2/4. 
McLoughlin  won  his  service.  On  the  last  point  the  American  smashed 
deep  to  Brookes'  backhand.  An  interfering  spectator  called  "out."  The 
act  confused  the  umpire,  who  ordered  a  replay,  but  Brookes  hit 
McLoughlin's  service  on  to  the  ground,  refusing  to  try  for  the  point. 
He  was  loudly  applauded   for  the  action.     At  deuce,  in  the  eighth  game. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  9 

Brookes  volleyed  twice  for  kills,  and  thereby  led  at  5/3.  McLoughlin 
took  the  ninth  by  fine  serving,  but  the  tenth  game  ended  the  match. 
McLoughlin  played  two  weak  volleys  and  finally  netted  an  easy  drive.

At  ten  minutes  to  four,  or  half  an  hour  after  the  first  match,  Wilding 
and  Long  took  the  court.  Wilding  won  the  toss  and  elected  to  serve. 
Long  misplayed  several  strokes,  and  the  first  game  went  to  Australia  to  15. 
On  Long's  service  it  was  at  once  evident  that  the  net  game  was  his  aim. 
His  delivery  was  very  fast,  but  certainly  erratic.  He  hit  his  second  ball 
as  hard  as  his  first,  and  though  he  double-faulted  frequently,  he  made  many 
clean  aces.  The  games  went  to  the  server  up  to  two-all,  at  which  Wilding, 
by  fine  driving  and  Long's  weak  play,  took  four  consecutive  games.  Longi 
had  become  very  unsteady,  and  though  he  occasionally  got  in  a  clever  volley, 
or  fast  drive,  the  majority  of  his  strokes  were  misplayed.  Wilding  drove 
finely.  He  came  to  the  net  only  when  forced  by  a  short  ball  from  Long, 
and  stayed  most  of  the  time  in  the  back  court.  The  second  set  developed 
into  a  much  better  contest.  At  no  time  were  the  men  separated  by  more 
than  a  game.  At  three-all  Long  got  0/40  on  Wilding's  service,  but  followed 
by  a  weak  toss,  a  fast  drive  which  just  missed  counting,  and  a  net.  After 
getting  vantage,  he  again  netted  and  Wilding  took  the  game  on  a  fine 
drive  and  well  placed  service.  Long  then  won  his  service  and  again  led 
on  Wilding's  delivery.  At  5/4  and  40/15  in  his  favor,  Long  drove  out 
twice  and  Wilding  lobbed  over  his  head  for  vantage.  He  passed  Long  for 
the  game  point.  The  next  two  games  were  all  in  Wilding's  favor.  Long 
played  weakly  and  the  Australian  player  passed  him  for  aces  easily.  The 
last  set  was  very  one-sided,  for  Long  was  unable  to  beat  Wilding's  fine 
drives.  Wilding  ran  to  3/0  before  Long  wedged  in  a  game  and  then  the 
former  ran  out  the  set.  Throughout  the  match  Wilding  remained  back 
and  relied  entirely  on  his  ground  strokes.  At  rare  intervals  his  sallies  to 
the  net  resulted  in  sharp,  _  clean  volleys,  generally  for  a  kill,  but  as  his 
back-court  game  was  winning,  there  was  no  necessity  for  adopting  other 
tactics.  However,  it  was  quite  evident  that  Wilding  had  much  in  reserve. 
Long  played  a  fine  game,  but  made  far  too  many  errors  to  allow  a  pos- 
sibility of  winning.  His  play,  however,  gave  great  promise,  and  made  a 
most     favorable     impression.      The     score:

The  opinion  held  by  many  experts  that  the  slowness  of  the  courts  had 
seriously  affected  the  visitors'  play,  was  clearly  established  by  their  play 
in  the  doubles  match   on  Monday.      Fine  player   as   Brookes  is,   and  splendid

as  is  the  record  of  Wilding,  there  is  no  doubt  that  Long  played  a  finer 
game  at  almost  every  point  than  either  of  the  defenders.  He  was  sure  on 
every  stroke  and  killed  every  loose  ball.  His  service  was  clean,  hard  and 
well  placed,  and  his  judgment  superb.  McLoughlin  was  not  far  behind 
him,   lacking  only  Long's  splendid  control   of  his  ground  strokes.. 

Play  started  at  twenty-five  minutes  to  four,  somewhat  late  as'  it  turned 
out,  as  the  shadows  from  the  Western  stand  had  fallen  on  the  court  before 
played  ceased.  Brookes  served  first,  and  McLoughlin  took  the  right  court. 
The  first  game  went  to  Australia  and  the  second  to  America.  Back  and 
forth  went  the  games,  each  being  won  by  the  server,  until  the  umpire 
called  "ten-all."  Brookes  then  won  his  service  to  love  by  fine  serving,  and 
it  was  McLoughlin's  turn.  His  first  serve  was  returned  weakly  by  Wilding, 
but  he  netted  an  attempt  to  volley  across  court  for  the  second  point.  Then 
Wilding  scored  one  fine  drive  past  Long  at  the  net.  Brookes  played  a 
high,  slow  lift  in  the  next  point,  which  deceived  Long  into  letting  it  pass, 
It  dropped  well  inside  the  baseline.  At  15/40,  Long  made  a  fine  smash, 
"but  McLoughlin  then  served  a  double  fault  and  ended  the  set.  It  had 
taken  fifty  minutes  to  play  it  and  the  great  crowd  of  five  thousand  got 
their  money's  worth.  The  sentiment  was  all  in  favor  of  the  youngsters 
throughout  the  match,  and  the  loss  of  the  set  after  so  fine  a  try  for  it, 
■created  a  genuine   and   general   disappointment. 

The  second,  which  ran  on  services,  was  another  long,  hard  fight,  but 
went  to  Australia  finally  at  9/7.  All  through  Long's  play  was  splendid, 
but  McLoughlin  missed  many  hard  swings  and  was  less  consistent.  At 
7/8  McLoughlin  dropped  his  service  to  love  through  an  error  by  Long,  a 
pass  by  Brookes  across  court,  another  error  by  Long,  and  finally  a  wild 
drive  by  himself._  The  third  set  started  with  the  same  bitter  fight  on 
both  sides,  but  distress  signals  were  evidenced  by  the  youngsters  before 
very  long.  At  0/3  McLoughlin  took  his  service  to  15,  but  Brookes  came 
back  with  a  love  game  in  the  fifth,  making  the  score  4/1.  McLoughlin 
volleyed  brilliantly  in  the  sixth  game  and  brought  it  up  to  4/2.  Wilding's 
delivery  made  it  5/2,  but  McLoughlin  ."served  two  unplayable  balls  in  the 
next  game,  and  volleyed  twice  for  aces;  3/5.  Brookes'' service  next  and 
with  it  the  end,  although  twice  the  Americans  had  advantage.  Finally, 
Brookes  killed  neatly  with  a  backhand  smash  for  the  eleventh  point  and 
Long  followed  with  a  drive  into  the  net.  The  crowd  cheered  the  victors 
and  vanquished  with  equal  vigor,  and  it  was  agreed  that  a  finer  match  had 
never  been  played  in  Sydney.  During  the  last  set  McLoughlin  improved 
remarkably  and  outplayed  his  partner  and  opponents.  Hi-  volleying  was 
wonderful  and  his  service  deadly,  but  the  brace  came  too  late.     The  score:

The  result  of  the  first  three  matches  had  decided  the  custody  of  the 
Davis  Cup  for  another  year,  but  there  yet  remained  two  single  matches  to 
be  played.  The  courts  had  hardened  considerablv.  and  much  interest  was 
shown  in  to  what  degree  it  would  improve  the  visitors'  game.  Moreover, 
it  was  believed  that,  the  meeting  of  Wildin'-  and  McLoughlin  would  fur- 
nish the  evenest  contest,  and  so  it  proved.  The  first  set  was  odd  in  several 
respects.  The  first  game  went  to  deuce,  McLoughlin  winning  it  but 
Wilding's  service  began   a  series   of  love  games,  all  in   favor  of  the  server.

At  two-all  McLoughlin's  delivery  added  the  fourth  successive  love  game 
to  the  list.  At  3/2  the  American  started  a  dash  that  left  Wilding  with- 
out a  chance.  His  drives  in  the  next  four  games  were  splendid  and  his 
court  covering  remarkable.  At  5/3  he  took  his  own  service  handily,  win- 
ning the  set  point  on  a  clever  stop  volley.  The  first  game  in  the  second 
went  to  McLoughlin  on  Wilding's  service.  Twice  he  aced  Wilding  with 
very  fast  drives.  The  latter  began  to  get  greater  pace  to  his  strokes  there- 
after, and,  helped  by  some  very  weak  play  by  the  youngster,  ran  the  score 
up  to  4/1,  but  by  splendid  volleys  and  services  and  few  attempts  at  hard 
drives,  McLoughlin  took  three  successive  games  and  brought  the  score  to 
four-all.  In  the  next  game  the  American  followed  in  his  returns  of  serv- 
ice, but  played  too  close  to  the  side  lines,  and  Wilding  took  the  game 
largely  through  his  opponent's  errors.  McLoughlin  smashed  out  for  the 
first  point  in  the  tenth  game,  and  was  passed  down  his  left  sideline  for 
the  second,  but  finally  took  the  game  to  30.  The  next  game  was  splendidly 
contested,  but  Wilding  again  proved  the   steadier. 

At  5/6,  McLoughlin  took  his  seivice  to  love  by  three  splendid  volleys 
and  an  ace  down  the  center  line,  which  was  untouched.  Again  there 
was  a  long  struggle  for  Wilding's  service,  with  advantage  twice  in  favor 
of  McLoughlin.  The  latter  was  finally  beaten  by  a  high  drive,  which  he 
made  no  effort  to  play,  but  it  dropped  on  the  line.  In  the  fourteenth 
game  Wilding  lobbed  McLoughlin's  first  two  services,  but  the  tosses  were 
both  smashed  into  the  net.  The  American  then  served  two  aces  and 
smashed  a  deep  lob  for  40/30.  He  missed  another  toss,  however,  and 
was  beaten  on  a  slow  drive  to  his  feet  and  a  well  concealed  stroke,  from 
which   he   was   running   when   it   was   delivered. 

From  then  on  it  was  obvious  that  the  clever  placing  of  Wilding  and 
resulting  dashes  01  McLoughlin  had  taken  effect,  and  it  was  a  mentally 
and  physically  fatigued  player  that  began  the  third  set.  The  first  two 
had  occupied  an  hour,  but  the  pace  during  that  time  had  been  heart- 
breaking, and  the  California  boy's  vitality  had  experienced  a  heavy  tax. 
Wilding,  on  the  other  hand,  had  not  attempted  an  assault  from  the  net,  and 
consequently  had  comparatively  little  exertion.  His  magnificent  condition 
was  apparent  at  a  glance,  and  he  began  the  third  set  at  an  even  faster 
clip  than  he  had  maintained  in  the  earlier  stages.  McLoughlin  took  the 
opening  game  of  the  set,  but  Wilding  took  the  second  and  third  easily. 
Then  the  former  evened  by  fine  serving  for  a  love  game.  Wilding  in- 
creased his  speed,  and  by  hard  drives  and  good,  though  not  brilliant  vol- 
leys, ran  four  straight  games.  During  that  period  McLoughlin,  who  was 
very  tired,  scored  but  two  points.  The  fourth  set  began  with  a  love 
game  for  Wilding.  McLoughlin  braced  in  the  next  game  and  took  his 
service  after  15/40  had  been  called  against  him.  Wilding  forced  play 
again  for  three  games,  and  at  4/1  the  American  made  a  stand.  He 
smashed  finely  and  took  the  game  at  30.  Weak  play  followed  and  Wild- 
ing led  at  5/2.  McLoughlin  then  flashed  for  the  last  time  and  volleyed 
so  well  that  Wilding  got  but  one  point.  The  next  game  ended  the  match, 
for  Wilding  took  his   own   service   to   love. 

Wilding  was  evidently  a  '.rifle  stale,  for  he  took  a  long  time  to  get 
going,  but  when  he  did  his  speed  and  stamina  were  too  much  for  his 
youthful   rival.      The   scores: 

First   Set.

Another  surprise  occurred  in  the  Brookes-Long-  rubber,  which  began 
shortly  after  the  Wilding-McLoughlin  encounter.  Here,  however,  were 
no  lightning  smashes  nor  terrific  dri'^'es,  but  a  steady  succession  of  care- 
fully worked  out  rallies  by  both  players,  with  few  or  no  reckless  chances 
taken  or  unnecessarily  hard  shots  attempted.  Long  served  first,  and  with 
splendid  low  volleys  took  the  game  to  30.  Then  Brookes,  for  the  first 
time  in  the  matches,  lost  his  service.  Long's  receiving  was  very  strong, 
and  four  times  his  returns  were  so  hard  and  true  that  the  Australian  cap- 
tain netted  and  volleyed  out.  I'he  latter  then  captured  two  games  quietly, 
but  Long  took  his  third  delivery  after  deuce  was  called  once.  At  2/3 
Brookes  won  a  love  game.  Long  netted  his  first  three  returns,  and  the 
fourth,  a  weak  one,  was  smashed  by  Brookes  for  a  kill.  Long  dupli- 
cated Brookes'  feat  a  moment  later,  two  netted  returns,  a  smash  and  a 
service  ace  turning  the  trick.  Brookes  evened  with  fine  services,  onlj'  one 
being  rt turned.  Slow  drives  to  Long's  feet  as  he  ran  in  gave  Brookes  the 
ninth  game.  The  latter  served  then  and  got  to  40/0,  but  two  short  over- 
hand drives  by  Long  dropped  at  his  feet  and  were  volleyed  into  the  net. 
Long  made  it  deuce  wTth  a  fine  pass,  but  netted  his  next  return,  and  fol- 
lowed  with   a   wild   drive,   which   gave   Brookes  the  game   and  set. 

Long  started  well  in  the  second  set.  He  drove,  volleyed  and  served 
finely,  and  for  a  time  Brookes  was  cleanly  outplayed.  He  won  the  first 
game  on  service  to  love,  took  Brookes'  delivery  to  30,  and  captured  the 
third  game  by  a  similar  score.  After  a  sharp  rally  in  the  fourth  game. 
Long  passed  Brookes  with  a  backhand  drive,  but  the  latter  served  three 
fast  balls,  and  Long  drove  all  three  out  and  lost  the  game  by  a  net.  The 
Australian  then  evened  the  game  score  by  winning  Long's  delivery  and 
serving  a  love  game  handily.  The  seventh  game  went  to  Long.  He  lobbed 
over  Brookes'  head  for  the  game  point.  Brookes  won  his  service,  making 
it  four-all,  but  it  was  a  long  deuce  game,  and  the  next  game  touched  deuce 
also.  Long  made  two  successive  double  faults  in  that  game,  but  tossed 
to  the  Australian  backhand,  and  the  latter  missed.  At  4/5  the  defender 
took  the  game  to  30  and  won  the  odd  game  on  Long's  service.  _  The 
American  double  defaulted  on  his  last  delivery.  Long's  only  point  in  the 
next  game  was  a  net  cord  shot,  for  Brookes  won  his  service,  and  with  it 
his  second  set.  Again  Long  jumped  into  a  good  lead.  He  broke  through 
Brookes'  service  in  the  second  game  and  led  at  2/0,  but  the  latter  took 
the  third  and  fourth  games,  and  Long's  advantage  had  gone.  Two  deuce 
games  followed,  in  which  each  man  needed  but  a  point  to  win,  but  in 
both  cases  the  game  went  to  the  server.  At  three-all  Brookes  netted 
Long's  delivery  three  times,  and  was  aced  for  a  love  game.  The  next 
three  games  were  won  on  service,  although  at  3/4  Brookes  had  a  narrow 
escape,  a  drive  by  the  American,  which  would  have  made  it  3/5,  just 
dropping  out.  At  four-all  Brookes  aced  Long  twice  with  backhand  drives, 
and  won  the  game  to  love,  but  the  latter  broke  through  the  Australian's 
service  by  really  fine  driving.  Twice  he  passed  Brookes  clean  and  drove 
his  third  return  so  hard  that  Brookes  volleyed  it  way  out.  A  bad  miss 
of  an  easy  lob  gave  Long  the  game.  Two  double  faults  in  the  next  game 
by  Long  practically  settled  things,  for  at  deuce  Brookes  drove  twice  for 
aces.  The  fourteenth  game  was  a  masterful  demonstration  of  servmg  by 
Brookes.  Long,  in  trying  to  reach  the  ball,  netted  his  rival's  first  three 
deliveries.  Brookes  netted  in  an  attempt  to  cut  a  volley  off  short,  but 
followed  with   a  backhand  volley  which   Long  had   no   chance   to  reach.

On  Monday  evening,  November  25th,  the  Lawn  Tennis  Association  of 
Australia  tendered  a  dinner  at  the  Paris  House,  Sydney,  to  the  opposing  na- 
tional teams.  There  was  an  attendance  of  nearly  sixty  guests,  and  the  func- 
tion was  a  great  success  from  every  point  of  view.  The  president,  Mr.  P.  B. 
Colquhoun,  occupied  the  chair  and  proposed  the  toasts  of  the  King,  the 
President  of  the  United  States  and  the  United  States  team.  The  last  was 
responded  to  by  Dr.  Brathwaite  and  Messrs.  Long  and  McLoughlin.  Mr, 
Long  gave^  the  Australian  team,  and  to  this  Messrs.  Brookes  and  Wilding 
replied.  The  president  of  the  New  South  Wales  Association  then  proposed 
the  donor  of  the  Davis  Cup.  On  the  following  Friday  the  American  vis- 
itors took  part  in  an  invitation  doubles  tournament  promoted  by  the  New 
South  Wales  Association,  and  Messrs.  McLoughlin  and  Wright  won  in  the 
final  round  from  Messrs.  Long  and  Dunlop. 

The  visitors  subsequently  spent  a  few  days  doing  Sydney  harbor  by  launch 
and  visiting  other  points  of  interest  about  the  city,  starting  on  their  home 
journey  by  the  S.  S.  Aorangi  on  December  21. 


SPALDING'S   LAWN   TENNIS   ANNUAL.  17 

International  Preliminaries 

On  September  ii,  13  and  14,  at  the  Germantown  Cricket  Club,  Man- 
heim,  Philadelphia,  Great  Britain's  representatives  were  overwhelmingly 
beaten  in  the  preliminary  matches  for  the  right  to  challenge  in  Australia 
for   the   Davis    International   Trophy. 

The  visiting  team  was  composed  of  C.  P,  Dixon,  W.  C.  Crawley,  and 
captained  by  J.  C.  Parke,  who,  with  M.  J.  G.  Ritchie,  made  a  similar 
trip   in    1908. 

Familiar  with  Parke's  game  and  style  of  play,  Americans  were  waiting 
expectantly  for  the  appearance  of  Dixon  and  Crawley,  but  the  revelation 
was  distinctly  disappointing.  Neither  one  was  at  all  the  equal  of  the 
members  of  the  invaders'  teams  of  former  years,  and  their  showing  against 
both  Larned  and  Clothier,  America's  representatives,  was  not  encour- 
aging. 

Parke  played  first  position  for  the  Englishmen  with  Dixon  filling  the 
junior  post  and  Crawley,  with  Parke,  was  the  challenging  team  in 
doubles.  Just  why  Dixon  was  deemed  better  than  Crawley  and  selected 
to  play  in  the  singles  was  never  explained,  for  beyond  question,  Crawley 
proved  himself  much  the  better  of  the  two.  Parke  was,  if  anything,  a 
shade  below  his  form  of    1908. 

Play  was  begun  on  Saturday  afternoon  with  Parke  facing  Clothier  and 
Dixon  matched  with  Larned.  The  crowd  of  spectators  filled  every  bit  of 
space  around   both   courts,    for  the  matches  were  begun   simultaneously. 

The  Larned-Dixon  match  ended  first.  Dixon  was  outclassed  and  Larned, 
after  sounding  the  strength  of  his  opponent's  game,  merely  played  from 
the  back  of  the  court  and,  by  cleverly  placed  drives,  had  his  heavy  rival 
well  nigh  exhausted  before  the  match  had  fairly  begun.  The  humid  heat 
added  to  Dixon's  distress.  Occasional  bursts  of  speed  by  the  Englishman 
enlivened  matters  from  time  to  time,  but  they  were  not  long  sustained, 
and  Larned,  in  perfect  condition,  was  scarcely  warm  when  the  match  was 
over.      The  score  was  6/3,  6/2,   6/0. 

Meanwhile  Clothier  was  finding  greater  difficulty  in  disposing  of  Parke. 
Parke's  strength  lay  in  playing  from  the  back  court,  and  repeated  bursts 
of  applause  were  the  reward  of  numerous  pretty  drives  and  difficult  gets. 
The  Philadelphian,  throughout  the  match,  ran  to  the  net  and  his  volleying 
was  practically  faultless.  Parke  also  volleyed  well,  but  overhead  was  weak, 
and  the  American's  occasional  short  lobs  were  not  always  killed.  In  the 
third  set  the  visitor,  by  splendid  driving,  attained  a  lead  of  5/3,  put  when 
within  a  point  of  the  set,  missed  a  ridiculously  easy  smash  which  really 
cost  him  the  win.  Clothier  pulled  out  the  game  and  followed  with  eight 
consecutive  points,  thereby  o-etting  the  lead  of  6/5.  Another  deuce  game 
ensued,  which  went  to  Parke,  but  the  end  came  when  the  local  man  an- 
nexed  two   straight   games,   both  at    15. 

A  tremendous  crowd  turned  out  on  Monday  to  witness  the  doubles,  for 
the  American  combination  of  Little  and  Hackett  was  considered  by  many 
a  very  uncertain  quantity.  That  they  were  amply  repaid  was  demon- 
strated,  for  the   result   was  the   closest  kind   of  a  five-set  match. 

The  first  set  was  an  indicator  of  what  was  to  follow.  Neither  of  the 
Americans  seemed  fully  warmed  up  and  their  errors,  added  to  an  un- 
expected ability  to  smash  by  Parke,  soon  ended  the  set  in  favor  of  the 
Britons.  Little  began  the  second  set  by  the  loss  Oi  his  service,  but  he 
and  Hackett  rapidly  improved  in  team  work  and  at  four-all  ran  out  two 
games  without  losing  a  point.  The  third  set  was  a  duplicate  of  the  second. 
At  four-all  Little  and  Hackett  again  annexed  two  games.  Hackett's  de- 
fense was   almost   impossible   to   overcome. 

Throughout  the  fourth  set  the  Englishmen  maintained  a  lead,  Parke 
playing  cleverly  at  the  net  and  Crawley,  like  Hackett,  playing  a  fine  de- 
fensive game.  At  5/4  Parke  served  two  aces,  and  an  out  of  Hackett's, 
with  a  smash  by   Crawley,  made  the  score  two-sets-all.

The  fifth  set  was  long  and  bitterly  contested.  Hackett,  for  the  only 
time  in  the  match,  lost  his  service  with  the  first  game.  Crawley  followed 
and  his  service,  followed  by  Little  dropping  his  delivery,  made  the  score 
3/0.  At  this  period  a  decided  brace  by  the  Americans  resulted  in  their 
winning  four  successive  games.  It  was  a  great  puli-up,  and  the  cheering 
was  loud  and  long.  But  Parke  retaliated  with  a  love  game  and  again  the 
score  was  even.  The  next  three  games  were  all  won  by  the  server  at  love. 
Two  deuce  games  followed,  when  at  six-all  Hackett  won  his  game  and 
Crawley,  in  a  decidedly  weakened  condition,  was  unable  to  land  his  own. 
With  the  series  already  decided,  public  interest  abated  not  a  whit,  and 
Tuesday    found   another   crowded    grandstand   when   play    began. 

As  on  Saturday,  however,  both  matches  vcrc  won  in  straight  sets. 
Larned  was  in  superb  form,  and  Parke  was  never  within  striking  distance 
of  a  set.  Dixon  fared  no  better  at  Clothier's  hands,  and  of  the  six  sets 
played,    not    one   touched    deuce.      The    summaries :

DAVIS  CUP   TRIALS— SINGLE.^,   AT    MANIIEIM  CRICKET  CLUB, 
PHILADELPHIA,  PA.,  SEPTEMBER   11,   1909. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  21 

The   National   Championships 

A  National  Champion  for  the  fifth  time.  Such  was  the  record  which 
culminated  in  the  championship  for  1909  when  William  A.  Larned  met 
and  defeated  William  J.  Clothier  in  the  challenge  round  of  the  tourna- 
ment, held  as  usual  at  the  Newport  Casino.  The  match  was  played 
Friday,  August  27,  and  was  won  after  five  fast,  though  in  each  case, 
one-sided   sets. 

The  tournament,  with  an  entry  list  larger  than  ever  before,  164  names 
in  all,  was  nevertheless  disappointing,  for  F.  B.  Alexander,  B.  C.  Wright, 
R.  D.  Little  and  other  players  ol  high  standing  were  not  among  the 
contesta-!ts.  This  feature  was  in  a  measure  modified  by  the  entries  of 
M.  McLoughiin  and  M.  H.  Long,  the  youthful  cracks  from  San  Fran- 
cisco. A  great  number,  probably  two-thirds  of  the  players,  were,  in 
the  vernacular,  "dubs"  of  the  first  water,  but  several  upsets  of  a  startling 
nature  occurred  from  the  earliest  rounds  and  a  climax  impended  when 
McLoughiin,  for  a  brief  time,  threatened  the  aspirations  in  the  final 
round,   of  Clothier. 

Nothing  startling  occurred  in  the  preliminary  round,  unless  it  was  H. 
C.  Martin's  easy  victory  over  W.  H.  Connell.  Council  played  a  most 
erratic  game,  one  minute  beating  Martin  easily  and  the  next  making  absurd 
errors.  The  Crescent  Club  player  did  little  forcing,  simply  allowing  Con- 
nell to  beat  himself  with  his  numerous  outs  and  nets.  C.  C.  Pell  and 
P.  B.  Hawk  established  the  tournament's  record  set  in  their  match,  which 
Hawk  ultimately  won.  Pell,  a  hard  hitter  and  at  times  brilliant  player, 
won  the  first  set  at  6/1.  Hawk  took  the  second  at  6/0  and  then  began 
the  set  which  threatened  to  go  on  forever.  Finally,  at  15-all,  Pell  drove 
•out  three  successive  times  and  Hawk  won  the  next  game  on  service. 
Hawk  took  the  match  witn  the  next  set,  but  Pell  "'died  hard."  Sixteen 
^ames  were  played  before  his  wildness  beat  him  for  the  second  time. 
E.  H.  Whitney  unexpectedly  won  from  S.  M.  Sinsabaugh  in  the  next 
round,  and  G.  P.  Gardner,  Jr.,  pulled  out  his  match  with  G.  Janes. 
Janes  came  within  a  point  of  winning,  but  Gardner  hung  on  and  finally 
Tvon  out.  Had  the  Californian  played  a  bit  more  carefully,  he  might  have 
won,  but  he  tried  many  unnecessarily  difficult  plays  and  generally  failed 
to   pull    them   off. 

Several  interesting  matches  were  played  in  the  second  round.  Karl 
Behr  dropped  a  set  to  N.  Wadsworth  and  T.  C.  Bundy  was  forced  to  play 
his  hardest  against  young  G.  AL  Church.  The  schoolboy  took  the  open- 
ing set,  6/4,  and  came  very  near  to  duplicating  his  success  in  the  third. 
Bundy  won  at  4/6,  6/1,  7/5,  6/4.  F.  C.  Colston  had  hard  work  to 
win  from  Gardner  in  four  sets,  but  the  surprises  of  the  round  were  W. 
C.  Grant's  poor  showing  against  E.  P.  Larned  and  F.  C.  Inman's  straight 
set  win  from  R.  C.  Seaver.  The  Larned-Grant  match  was  most  disap- 
pointing. Larned  played  well,  but  Grant's  efforts  were  miserable.  He 
refused  absolutely  to  exert  himself  and  only  returned  balls  that  he  did 
not  have  to  run  for.  In  the  third  set  he  woke  up  loi.  ■  enough  to  carry 
the  score  to  four-all,  but  at  that  point  he  again  lapsed  into  a  state  of 
what  appeared  to  be  total  indifference,  and  allowed  Larned  to  win  the  last 
two  games.  Larned  drove  into  the  net  once  and  that  gave  Grant  his  only 
point. 

Inman  and  Seaver  furnished  the  principal  interest  of  the  day,  although 
only  three  sets  were  played.  A  fast  pace  was  set  at  the  beginning  and 
maintained  until  the  match  ended.  As  usual,  Seaver  stayed  in  the  back  of 
the  court  and  directed  his  efforts  at  passing  Inman  as  he  ran  in.  The 
plan  did  not  work  very  well,  however,  for  the  left-handed  New  Yorker 
was  remarkably  fast  on  his  feet  and  sure  in  volleying.  With  the  second 
set  Seaver  changed  his  tactics.  He  ran  in  under  his  service  and  forced 
Inman  to  stay  back.  At  five-all,  however,  Inman  came  in  on  everything 
and    was    so    much    more    active   and    severe    than    the    Bostonian,    that   the 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  23 

set  went  to  him  at  7/5.  The  third  set  was  slower,  for  both  players 
seemed  thoroughly  fatigued.  Inman  was  apparently  in  greater  distress 
than  Seaver,  but  he  kept  going  without  a  letup.  At  2/4  in  Seaver's  favor, 
Inman  cut  loose.  He  played  at  top  speed  and  just  lasted  long  enough 
to  take  the  set  at  6/4.      He  was  completely  "in"  when  it  was  all  over. 

The  sensation  of  the  next  round,  the  fifth,  occurred  when  T.  R.  Pell 
and  N.  W.  Niles  met.  Pell  started  in  his  usual  nervous  fashion.  He 
made  so  many  errors  and  used  such  bad  judgment  that  Niles  took  the 
set  easily  at  6/3.  The  second  set  found  him  going  better,  but  still  er- 
ratic. Niles  led  up  to  4/3,  when  Pell's  streak  materialized.  He  played 
all  around  the  Bostonian  for  three  games,  and  the  set  score  was  evened. 
The  third  set  went  to  Niles  by  6/3.  Pell's  forehand  drive  hit  the  net 
too  often  and  Niles'  net  work  was  very  fast  and  steady.  But  the  fourth 
set  was  another  like  the  second.  Pell  was  going  easily,  driving  from 
his  backhand  for  repeated  aces,  and  serving  splendidly.  Niles  was  scared 
away  from  the  net  and  Pell  took  the  set  6/4.  The  last  set  was  worth 
seeing.  Niles  started  determinedly  and  Pell  wavered  enough  to  let  Niles 
take  a  lead  of  two  games,  with  little  or  no  opposition.  Niles  continued 
to  run  in  on  everything,  but  Pell  began  to  pass  him  pretty  regu- 
larly. At  three-all  Niles  broke  through  Pell's  service,  but  three  clean 
passes  in  the  next  game  by  Pell  and  a  bad  attempt  to  volley  by  Niles, 
evened    the    games. 

Niles  broke  through  Pell's  delivery  again,  but  try  as  he  would,  he  could 
not  win  his  own.  Pell  took  big  chances  on  all  his  returns,  but  his  control 
was  good,  and  Niles  watched  helplessly  as  the  balls  shot  by  him.  At 
five-all  Pell  served  a  double,  made  a  weak  attempt  to  smash,  was  beaten 
by  a  beautiful  cross-court  drive  as  he  ran  in  and  volleyed  into  the  bottom 
of  the  net  for  the  game  point.  But  Niles  fell  down  again  for  the  third 
time  on  his  service.  He  dropped  it  after  leading  at  40/15.  Pell  rushed 
to  the  net  in  the  odd  game  and  Niles  drove  twice  out  of  court.  The 
third  point  went  to  Niles  on  a  net-cord  shot,  but  the  next  was  Pell's 
by  virtue  of  a  splendid,  line  drive  from  a  difficult  position.  The  winning 
point  followed  with  the  first  service  ace  Pell  made  in  the  match.  The  last 
games  ended  quickly.  Niles'  nerve  seemed  exhausted  and  he  made  two 
bad  errors.  Pell  passed  him  for  0/40  and  the  match  ended  by  a  beautiful 
lob  by   Pell  of  a  smash  that  seemed  certain  to  count. 

Hardly  less  surprising  than  Niles'  defeat,  was  Colston's  victory  over 
W.  F.  Johnson.  The  Baltimorean  had  improved  each  day  and  was  play- 
ing at  the  very  height  of  his  game  when  he  faced  the  intercollegiate 
champion.  Johnson,  on  the  other  hand,  seemed  overplayed  and  not  nearly 
so  fast  as  he  was  a  week  earlier  at  Southampton.  Colston  found  his 
opponent's  chops  almost  unplayable  in  the  first  set,  and  his  eflforts  to 
beat  him  from  the  base  line  were  hopeless.  He  decided  to  come  in  then 
and  his  net  work  was  so  fast  and  sure  that  he  won  the  second  set,  6/3, 
and  the  third  6/4.  The  pace  was  too  fast,  however,  and  he  played  from  the 
base  line  during  the  fourth  set.  Under  those  conditions  he  was  at  John- 
son's mercy  and  one  game  was  his  portion  for  the  set.  The  deciding  set 
was  sharp  and  short.  Colston  resumed  his  net  play  and  Johnson  could 
not  get  by  him.  At  times,  when  Colston  slowed  up  a  bit,  Johnson 
would  come  fast,  but  each  time  he  began  to  even  things  up  Colston 
would  make  a  dash  for  the  net  and  increase  his  lead.  He  finally  won  the 
set,  6/3,  but  it  was  much  closer  than  the  score  indicates.  With  those 
two  exceptions,  favorites  won  throughout  the  round.  Clothier  disposed 
of  veteran  H.  W.  Slocum  in  three  sets;  Whitney  outclassed  H.  R.  Scott; 
Bundy  won  easily  from  S.  Henshaw ;  W.  B.  Cragin,  Jr.,  lostta  set  to 
Richard  Stevens,  and  Inman,  C.  M.  Bull,  Jr.,  Touchard,  B.' Wagner, 
and  C.  S.  Rogers,  all  came  through.  R.  H.  Palmer  caught  E.  P.  Larned 
when  the  latter  was  decidedly  off  ani  won  in  four  sets,  but  the  great 
match  of  the  day  developed  when  the  California  youngsters,  M.  E.  Mc- 
Loughlin  and  M.  H.  Long,  came  together.  Their  careless,  free  style, 
so    unlike    any    Easterner's    game ;    their    terrific    hitting    and    furious    pace. 


24  SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

wifh  never  a  moment's  cessation,  made  theirs  the  most  interesting  match 
of  the  entire  meeting.  One  bad  but  unobserved  feature  of  their  play  was 
the  enormous  number  of  errors  each  made,  but  this  potent  fault  passed 
unnoticed  in  the  face  of  the  most  astounding  aces  and  remarkable  bril- 
liancy ever  witnessed  on  the  famous  old  championship  court.  McLoughlin 
started  like  a  whirlwind.  For  two  sets,  and  the  better  part  of  the  third, 
Long  was  beaten  to  a  standstill.  Then,  when  within  a  game,  and  even 
a  point  of  defeat.  Long,  apparently  with  the  courage  born  of  despair,  started 
a  winning  streak  which  completely  overshadowed  his  rival's  brilliance  of 
the  first  two  sets.  From  2'e,,  and  15/40,  Long  pulled  out  the  set,  7/5, 
won  the  fourth  set  at  6/2,  and  hung  to  McLoughlin  until  the  games 
reached  eight-all  in  the  fifth  set.  The  latter  then  won  the  two  succes- 
sive games  necessary.  All  through  the  match  each  boy  made  wretched 
errors,  but  wonderful  aces  with  an  equal  frequence.  There  were  almost  no 
rallies.  Each  had  a  practically  unplayable  service  and  when  one  could 
reach  it  an  ace  or  error  was  invariably  the  return.  McLoughlin's  smash 
is  probably  the  most  severe  and  effective  in  use  today,  his  service  is 
remarkably  fine,  and  he  volleys  with  a  sharpness  and  accuracy  unexcelled. 
His  ability  to  anticipate  an  opponent's  play  is  another  invaluable  factor 
of  his  game,  but  both  he  and  Long  share  the  same  weakness,  namely, 
extrernely  poor'  ground  strokes.  It  is  a  question  of  ace  or  nothingr 
nine  times  out  of  ten,  and,  by  the  same  proportion,  it  is  usually  the  latter. 
Long's  game  is  very  similar  to  McLoughlin's.  His  service  is' but  little 
inferior,  overhead  he  is  as  effective,  though  hits  with  less  pace,  and  at  vol- 
leying,_  is  even  cleverer  than  McLoughlin,  if  that  could  be.  One  thing- 
Long  is  superior  to  the  former  in,  and  that  is  tactics.  He  is  a  better 
general, _  conceives  more  daring,  effective  plays,  but  his  erraticness  pre- 
vents   him    fiom    executing   successfully,    his   brilliantly    clever   iaeas. 

In  the  sixth  round  Clothier,  Whitney,  Bundy  and  Cragin  filled  the 
brackets  in  the  upper  half,  while  the  rest  were  taken  up  by  Palmer,  Mc- 
Loughlin, Inman  and  Touchard.  Clothier  met  Behr  and,  after  losing 
the  first  set,  went  through  the  succeeding  three  rather  easily.  Whitney 
and  Biindy  outclassed  Scott  and  N.  G.  Johnson,  their  respective  opponents, 
and  Inman  and  Touchard  had  an  equally  easy  time  with  C.  S.  Rogers  and 
B.  Wagner.  Bull  was  no  match  for  McLoughlin,  but  Palmer  and  Cragin 
had  their  hands  full.  Palmer's  opponent  was  Colston  and  a  closer  match 
could  not  have  been  played.  Palmer  was  very  wild  when  the  match 
began.  He  drove  way  out  or  onto  the  net,  and  could  do  nothing  well. 
Colston  took  the  set.  6/0.  With  the  beginning  of  the  second  set,  Palmer 
steadied.  He  passed  the  old  Yale  captain  repeatedly  and  took  the  set 
at  6/4.  Palmer  continued  to  improve  and  ran  out  the  third  set  in  short 
order  at  6/1.  He  continued  to  lead  Colston  until,  at  5/4,  the  latter  ran 
out  thre  games  by  splendid  placing  and  a  consistent  net  attack.  The  fifth 
set  was  very  even.  At  four-all.  Palmer  broke  through  Colston's  service  and, 
though  he  was  fast  tiring,  he  managed  by  a  supreme  effort  to  bang  out 
his   own   in   the   next   game. 

The  only  upset  of  the  round  was  a  decided  one.  It  was  Pell's  defeat 
by  Cragin.  Cragin  was  beaten,  6/0,  in  the  opening  set,  but  his  discon- 
certing steadiness  and  easy,  soft  balls  completly  upset  Pell  before  the 
second  set  was  well  under  way.  He  became  more  and  more  erratic  and 
Cragin  took  the  second  set,  6/2.  Pell  made  a  determined  effort  to  pull 
himself  together  in  tlie  third  set.  It  was  even  at  four-all,  and  Pell  led 
at  40/15  in  the  ninth  game  before  Cragin  overhauled  him.  The  latter 
made  several  slow,  short  passes,  and  Pell's  errors  in  the  tenth  game  cost 
him  the  set.  The  fourth  set  was  a  long,  slow  affair.  The  rallies  were 
lengthy  ones,  but  sooner  or  later.  Pell  wound  them  up  with  misplays. 
Before  the  set  ended  he  had  fallen  into  Cragin's  easy  game  and,  at  that, 
was  no  match  for  the  .lerseymah.      The  set  went  to   Cragin  at  6/3. 

In  the  upper  half  of  the  next  round  Clothier  faced  Whitney  and  Bundy 
drew  Cragin.  Clothier  played  easily  and  was  never  forced,  but  at  that  Whit- 
ney was  outclassed  and  went  down  in  straight  sets.     The  Cragin-Bundy  af- 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  25 

fair  was  disappointing.  Cragin  was  conceded  a  fair  chance  against  the  Cali- 
fornian,  but  it  never  materialized.  The  little,  easy  shots  which  wrought 
such  havoc  with  Pell  failed  to  bother  Bundy  in  the  least  and  he  won 
easily  at  6/i,  7/5,  6/2.  In  the  lower  half  McLoughlin  and  Palmer  met 
in  the  feature  match  of  the  day,  but,  with  the  exception  of  the  first  set, 
the  fight  was  very  one-sided.  It  was  McLoughlin's  service  that  bothered 
Palmer.  He  won  his  own  up  to  five-all,  but  not  once  did  he  break  through 
his  opponent's.  The  latter's  break  and  twist  were  very  severe  and  though 
Palmer  stood  ten  yards  or  more  back  of  the  base  line  and  tried  to  drive 
it,  his  efforts  proved  disastrous  in  the  extreme.  Even  when  he  succeeded 
in  returning  the  ball,  McLoughlin  was  there  waiting  for  it,  and  Palmer 
was  so  far  out  of  position  that  it  was  impossible  to  prepare  himself  for 
the  inevitable  short  volley  that  met  his  returns.  At  five-all,  McLoughlin 
broke  through  Palmer's  service  and  won  his  own  with  the  next  game. 
The  second  set  was  a  duplicate  of  the  first,  except  that  McLoughlin 
won  Palmer's  service  one  game  sooner  than  in  the  first.  The  third  set 
ended  quickly  at  (>l2.  Not  once  in  the  match  did  Palmer  succeed  in 
winning  his  young  rival's  remarkable  delivery  and  therein  lies  the  whole 
tale  of  his  defeat.  The  remainmg  match  of  the  round  was  a  rather  tedious 
affair,  between  Touchard  and  Inman.  Inman  played  well,  but  Touchard 
was  way  oft  during  the  earlier  stages.  The  latter  won  the  first  set, 
6/4,  and  Inman  took  the  next  two  by  similar  scores.  He  kept  on  until 
the  score  stood  at  5/2  and  40/15,  when,  in  his  anxiety  to  end  the  set,  he 
made  two  errors  that  should  properly  have  been  aces.  Touchard,  en- 
couraged by  Inman's  unsteadiness,  made  a  renewed  attempt  to  win  and 
finally  pulled  out  the  set  at  8/6.  The  fifth  set  ended  quickly.  Inman,  be- 
sides being  thoroughly  exhausted,  was  attacked  by  cramps  and  Touchard 
had   no   difficulty   in   running   out   the   set   at   6/2. 

The  semi-finals  found  Clothier  bracketed  with  Bundy  and  Touchard 
pitted  against  McLoughlin.  It  was  an  even  division  of  East  versus  West, 
and  the  result  in  botn  cases  was  predicted  truly.  Clothier  won  the  first 
two  sets  easily.  Then  Bundy  forged  ahead  rapidly,  but,  just  when  the 
Californian  seemed  about  to  even  matters,  Clothier  forced  the  score  fronx 
3/S  against  him,  taking  four  straight  games  and  the  match.  Score,  6/3, 
6/2,  6/8,  7/5.  In  the  lower  half  McLoughlin  received  a  temporary  scare 
when,  with  a  set  each,  Touchard  ran  three  consecutive  games  and  later 
led  at  6/5,  but  the  New  Yorker  was  not  equal  to  the  occasion.  McLough- 
lin forced  the  play  with  such  vehemence  that  Touchard  was  rapidly  worn 
down  and  thereafter  scored  but  two  games. 

The  final  with  Clothier  facing  McLoughlin  was  very  evenly  contested,, 
Clothier  just  managed  to  pull  out  the  first  two  sets.  Neither  player 
managed  to  break  throueh  the  other's  service  with  much  success,  although 
Clothier  lost  his  in  the  beginning  of  the  second  set.  McLoughlin  led  at 
3/1,  then  at  4/2,  but  Clothier's  splendidly  accurate  net  attack  at  that  point 
upset  McLoughlin  completely.  He  became  extremely  wild  and,  princi- 
pally through  his  opponent's  errors,  Clothier  ran  out  the  set,  6/4.  The 
third  set  was  the  best  of  the  match.  McLoughlin  seemed  for  a  time  dis- 
couraged and  plaved  with  less  sting  to  his  shots.  Games  were  evenly 
divided  up  to  four-all,  when  Clothier  broke  through  the  San  Franciscan's 
delivery  for  the  advantage.  But  the  end  apparently  in  sight,  was  post- 
poned. With  a  sudden  burst  of  speed,  McLoughlin  drove  two  perfect 
aces  past  Clothier  as  the  latter  ran  in,  and  an  error  of  the  Philadelphian's 
was  followed  by  a  srnash  such  as  only  McLoughlin  can  make.  At  nine- 
all  Clothier  was  again  played  to  a  standstill  and  dropped  the  following^ 
two  games  without  much  resistance.  McLoughlin  maintained  his  ac- 
curacy and  terrific  hitting  long  enough  to  win  three  of  the  first  four 
games  in  the  next  and  last  set,  but  Clothier,  by  a  supreme  effort,  pulled 
out  five  straight  games,  making  in  that  period,  but  three  errors. 

The  end  of  the  meeting  on  the  following  day  was  correctly  prophesied. 
Larned  was  in  magnificent  form  and  held  the  upper  hand  throughout. 
In   the   first   two   sets   his   play    was   practically  faultless.      Clothier's   every 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  27 

move  was  blocked  and  he  actually  looked  ridiculous.  Larned  ran  the 
gamvit  of  strokes  from  lob  to  smasii,  and  all  were  executed  with  the 
same  machine-like  precision  and  periection.  For  that  period  at  least, 
it  was  apparently  impossible  for  him  to  err  in  judgment  or  in  execution. 
In  the  third  set  Larned  continued  his  masterful  play  for  just  one  game. 
Then  Clothier's  desperate  efforts  began  to  take  effect.  He  outplayed  the 
champion  for  four  games,  and  the  old  time  Larned  erraticness  seemed  about 
to  materialize.  However,  nothing  of  the  kmd  happened.  Larned  simply 
put  more  force  in  his  shots  and  energy  in  court  covering,  and  duplicated 
his  rival's  run  of  games,  thereby  taking  the  lead.  At  that  point  he  again 
let  up  and  Clothier,  playing  really  splendid  tennis,  ran  out  the  set.  The 
fourth  set  was  absurdly  ridiculous,  for  Larned  refused  flatly  to  work. 
He  loafed  around  his  base  line  with  only  rare  rushes  to  the  net  and  re- 
peatedly allowed  balls  to  pass  him  that  a  step  or  two  would  have  enabled 
him  to  reach.  Clothier  need  not  have  played  so  well  as  he  did  to  win  at 
6/i. 

The  fifth  and  last  set  found  Larned  again  playing  at  the  very  height  of 
his  game.  Clothier  really  was  never  allowed  to  start  and,  though  he  won 
the  second  game,  it  was  the  champion's  shots,  out  by  inches,  that  made 
it   possible. 

Larned's  victory  was  decidely  popular  and  it  was  the  consensus  of 
opinion  that  the  old  campaigner,  after  more  than  a  score  of  years  of  com- 
petition, was  better  than  ever   before. 

As  for  the  tournament's  management  a  word  must  be  said  in  praise  of 
those  who  conducted  it  as  well  as  for  groundsman  Pettit,  whose  able  care 
was  responsible  for  the  magnificent  condition  of  the  famous  turf  courts. 
Matches  were  run  off  with  a  gratifying  promptness  and  no  partiality  shown 
the  few  cracks  over  the  huge  number  of  inferior  men.     The  summaries:

National  Championship  Doubles. 


A  bright,  warm  day  and  an  enormous  crowd  greeted  Hackett  and 
Alexander  and  their  challengers  from  California,  M.  E.  McLoughlin  and 
G.   J.   Janes,    when   they  faced   each   other   on   Thursday,    August    19. 

The  championship  court  was  in  splendid  condition  and  the  men  on  edge 
and   keen   for   play   after   two   days'   inactivity,   due   to   rain. 

McLoughlin  started  play  by  serving,  and  his,  delivery  was  so .  fast  and 
well  placed  that  the  champions  failed  to  score  a  point  in  the  first  game, 
riackett's  easy  looking  service  came  next  and  after  losing  two  points  he 
evened  the  game  score.  All  through  the  first  set  the  challengers'  nervous- 
ness was  very  apparent.  McLoughlin  was  particularly  erratic  and  missed 
several  easy  smashes.  Janes  played  better,  but  Hackett's  play  was  far  ahead 
of  his  partner's  and  rivals'.  Alexander  did  not  settle  down  until  the  Coast 
men  led  at  3/2,  but  after  that  he  struck  his  gait  and  played  fast  and,  at 
intervals,  brilliant  tennis.  At  5/3  in  favor  of  the  title  holders  Janes  came 
into  the  game  and  by  remarkable  smashing  broke  through  Alexander's 
service.  It  was  the  last  for  the  Westerners,  however,  for  McLoughlin's 
delivery  was  lost  and   with   it   the   set,   6/4. 

The  second  set  started  in  a  runaway  for  Hackett  and  Alexander.  By 
forcing  every  opportunity  they  ran  four '  straight  games.  The  challengers 
took  the  fifth,  but  lost  the  sixth  game.  At  1/5  they  made  a  remarkable 
stand  and  just  failed  to  even  the  score.  At  4/5  they  made  several  errors 
and   the   second   set   went  to  the   champions. 

The  third  and,  as  it  happened,  the  last  set,  was  short  and  one-sided. 
Secure  in  their  lead,  the  Easterners  cut  loose  and  by  a  wonderful  burst  of 
speed,  in  which  Alexander  played  marvelously.  they  ran  out  six  consecu- 
tive games.  In  the  entire  set  tlie  visitors  scored  but  seven  points  and 
not  one  of  the  games  touched  deuce.  The  challengers  were  powerless 
before  the  brilliancy  of  Alexander  and  consistent  acing  l^y  Hackett.  The 
latter's  drives  across  court  were   faultless  and  he   never  missed. 

While  McLoughlin  and  Janes  i)layed  splendidly  at  times,  their  work 
was,  on  the  whole,  much  too  erratic.  Janes  was  the  target  for  the  cham- 
pions' shots  and,  though  he  bore  up  well  at  first,  toward  the  end  he 
became  hopelessly  wild.  In  team  work  and  individual  ability  the  title 
holders  outclassed  the  Coast  pair,  although  McLoughlin's  service  and 
smashing  was  quite  in  a  class  by  itself.  Off  the  ground  and  volleying 
both  Alexander  and  Hackett  were   better  than   he.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  31 

Women's   National   Championships 

Following  on  the  heels  of  Miss  May  Sutton,  another  California  girl,  Miss 
Hazel  Hotchkiss,  traveled  east  and  won  the  national  title.  Practically  all 
the  experts  in  the  east  played  in  the  tournament,  which  began  on  June  21, 
at  the   Philadelphia  Cricket   Club. 

Fortunately  the  draw  was  very  evenly  divided,  so  that  the  two  best,  Miss 
Hotchkiss  and  Miss  Louise  Hammond,  did  not  meet  until  the  final  round. 

Neither  player  had  much  difficulty  in  coming  through.  Miss  Hotchkiss 
did  not  lose  a  set,  defeating  in  succession  Mrs.  W.  B.  Rankine,  6/0,  6/0; 
Mrs.  W.  H.  Pouch,  champion  in  1906,  6/4,  6/2;  Miss  E.  Scott,  6/3,  6/0, 
and  Miss  E.   Rotch,  6/2,  7/5. 

Miss  Hammond's  road  was  almost  as  smooth.  Her  first  victim.  Miss  H. 
Deshler,  was  defeated  6/2,  6/2,  but  Miss  Claire  Johnson,  the  young  sister 
of  Wallace  Johnson,  made  a  plucky  stand.  Miss  Hammond  took  the  open- 
ing set  6/0,  but  Miss  Johnson  squared  the  match  by  winning  the  second,  6/3. 
The   deciding  set  went  to   Miss   Hammond   rather  easily. 

The  final  round,  played  on  Friday,  developed  a  splendid  contest.  Miss 
Hammond  passed  Miss  Hotchkiss  several  times  in  the  early  part  of  the  first 
set,  with  the  result  that  the  visitor  decided  to  remain  back.  Miss  Hammond 
more  than  held  her  own  at  driving,  however,  and  after  a  stiff  fight  won  the 
first  set,  8/6.  Miss  Hammond's  efforts  in  the  initial  set  told  on  her  de- 
cidedly, and  her  play  became  quite  weak.  Miss  Hotchkiss  began  to  take 
the  net  again  and  the  result  was  disastrous  indeed  to  the  eastern  girl.  The 
score  was  6/1.  The  deciding  set,  although  always  in  favor  ot  the  Califor- 
nian,  was  very  closely  contested.  At  3/1  against  her  Miss  Hammond  made 
a  splendid  stand,  rive  times  she  passed  her  opponent  as  the  latter  came 
in  and  evened  the  score.  Miss  Hotchkiss  then  won  two  more  games  before 
Miss  Hammond  annexed  her  last  game  of  the  match. 

The  challenge  round,  which  was  played  on  Saturday,  was  extremely  dis- 
appointing. Mrs.  Wallach  was  in  anything  but  good  form  and  a  recent 
illness  accentuated  her  poor  condition.  Almost  immediately  Miss  Hotchkiss 
discovered  her  opponent's  one  great  weakness,  her  backhand,  and  from  the 
first  to  the  last  game  Mrs.  Wallach  was  allowed  but  few  opportunities  to 
get  her  forehand  stroke  in  action.  Miss  Hotchkiss  won  ten  successive 
games.     Then  Mrs.  Wallach  made  her  only  tally  in  the  match.

84  SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL. 

Preliminary   National   Doubles 

On  August  3  and  4  the  teams  representing  the  East,  West,  South  and 
Pacific  Coast  met  on  the  famous  Onwentsia  Club's  courts  at  Lake  Forest, 
III.,  to  decide  the  play  off  which  brought  forth  a  challenging  team  for  the 
title  of  National  Doubles  Champions.  It  was  the  first  time  in  sixteen  years 
that  a  meeting  of  national  import'  was  allotted  Chicago  or  the  Middle 
West   and   the   number   of   tennis    enthusiasts    turned   out   accordingly. 

It  fell  to  the  South's  representatives,  T.  R.  Pell  and  W.  C.  Grant,  New 
Yorkers,  who  had  a  month  before  won  the  Southern  title,  to  start  the  ball 
rolling  with  Trux  Emerson  and  R.  A.  Holden,  Jr.,  the  West's  premier  pair. 
For  tiie  first  two  sets  the  Chicago  team  was  totally  unable  to  keep  up  with 
the  fast  pace  set  by  the  New  Yorkers.  Pell  and  Grant  ran  out  the  first 
set,  6/3,  playing  smoothly  together  with  few  errors,  and  their  streak  carried 
them  through  the  first  five  games  of  the  second  set  before  Emerson  and 
Holden  broke  through.  The  check  lasted  for  two  games,  when  Grant,  by 
winning  his  service  at  love,  ended  the  second   set. 

With  the  score  2/0  in  the  third  set,  it  looked  bad  for  the  Chicagoans, 
but  an  unexpected  rally  that  was  almost  successful  brought  the  spectators 
to  their  feet.  However,  at'  5/3  Grant  won  his  service  and  Holden  dropped 
his  through  a  series  of  sharp  returns,  which  evened  the  game  score  at  five- 
all.  At  six-all.  Pell  won  his  delivery  and  Holden's  again  proved  the  vulner- 
able point  in  his  game.  The  set  was  well  contested  and  all  four  played 
fast,  hard  tennis.  Had  Holden's  service  been  stronger,  the  set  might  have 
gone  to  Emerson  and  him,  for  in  other  departments  of  the  game  the  West- 
ern pair,  for  that  set  at  least,  had  much  the  better  of  the  argument.  Im- 
mediately following  that  match  the  Coast  team,  G.  James  and  M.  McLough- 
lin,  took  the  court  againstthe  Eastern  combination,  N.  W.  Niles  and  A.  S. 
Dabn'ey,  Jr.  The  Californians  were  slow  to  start.  McLoughlin  commenced 
the  match  by  losing  his  service  and  the  P>oston  pair  ran  up  the  score  to 
3/1.  At  4/2,  Janes'  service  was  lost,  but  McLoughlin,  who  until  then  had 
played  badly,  suddenly  found  himself  and,  ably  assisted  by  Janes,  quickly 
evened  the  score.  The  brace  took  the  heart  out  of  the  Easterners  and  the 
set  ended  by  a  series  of  errors  and  an  inability  to  pull  themselves  together. 
The  second  set  was,  so  far  as  a  contest  was  concerned,  the  best.  How- 
ever, at  four-all,  the  Easterners  again  faltered  and  McLoughlin  and  Janes 
hammered  out  the  necessary  two  games.  At  this  point  rain  interrupted 
play,  but  the  sky  quickly  cleared  and  the  match  was  resumed.  With  the 
score  two  sets  to  love,  McLoughlin  and  Janes,  encouraged  by  their  lead, 
cut  loose.  Both  played  at  terrific  speed,  McLoughlin's  service  counting 
repeated  aces  and  Janes'  smashes  fairly  burying  the  ball.  It  was  an  attack 
really  irresistible  and  Niles  and  Dabney  were  powerless  before  it.  Over- 
confidence,  added  to  a  fair  amount  of  misplays  by  the  Coast  players,  gave 
the  Easterners  the  opportunity  to  win  two  games,  but  their  comparatively 
feeble  efi^orts  were  again   smothered  in  the  ninth  and  last  game. 

On  the  following  afternoon,  August  5,  the  winning  pairs  faced  each  other 
before  an  immense  crowd  of  spectators.  The  sensational  style  of  the  Coast 
team  had  its  effect  and  everywhere  prophesies  of  a  defeat  for  the  Southern- 
ers were  to  be  heard.  McLoughlin,  in  characteristic  manner,  started  the 
ball  rolling  by  hammering  out  a  service  for  the  initial  point  at  unplayable 
Speed.  However,  Pell  and  Grant,  not  the  least  dismayed,  continued  to  hold 
their  own  till  the  score  reached  four-all.  Then  Janes  won  his  service.  A 
change  of  tactics  at  this  point  worked  wonders  and  by  rushing  the  net  on 
every  return.  Pell  and  Grant,  to  the  surprise  of  all,  ran  out  three  straight 
games  and  the  set,  7/5.  But  their  bolt  was  shot.  The  loss  of  the  first 
set  acted  as  a  stimulus  and  the  Californians  started  a  pace  far  too  fast  for 
the  Southern  pair.  Not  that  they  had  an  easy  time;  far  from  it;  the  slight- 
est let-up  and  Pell  and  Grant  would  come  on  with  a  rush.  But  the  re- 
morseless grind  continued  all  through  the  three  sets  with  little  cessation 
and  the  New  Yorkers  were  ever  on  the  defensive.  Their  greatest  speed  was 
too  slow  and  their  safe  play  simply  deferred  an  inevitable  defeat.  The 
score  of  the  last  three  sets  was  6/2,  (>lz,  6/z- 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Sectional    Championships 


Longwood  Tournament  and  Eastern  Doubles  Championship. 

With  an  entry  second  only  to  the  National  Championship,  both  in 
size  and  quality,  the  annual  Longwood  tournament  at  Brookline,  Mass., 
was  played   for  the   twentieth  time. 

Thirty-one  teams  entered  to  compete  for  the  title  of  Eastern  Doubles 
Champions,  and  the  famous  Longwood  Cup  was  sought  after  by  no 
fewer  than  eighty-six  wielders  of  the  racket.  The  usual  crowds  of  spec- 
tators,  for  in  no  place  in  the  country  is  the  game  more  popular  than 
in  Boston,  turned  out  each  afternoon,  and  only  one  day  of  rain  marrf=:d. 
the   schedule. 

The  teams  to  reach  the  final  round  were  R.  D.  Little,  paired  with  E. 
P.  Larned,  and  N.  W.  Niles  with  A.  S.  Dabnev,  Jr.,  for  a  partner. 
The  former  combination  almost  succumbed  to  the  attack  of  W.  J. 
Clothier  and  W.  F.  Johnson,  winning  after  five  hard  sets  in  the  semi- 
final round,  while  Niles  and  Dabney  lost  only  one  set  in  earning  the 
right   to   play   for   the   title. 

The  appearance  of  D.  F.  Davis,  donor  of  the  Davis  international  trophy,, 
paired  with  ex-Champion  M.  D.  Whitman,  was  a  notable  feature  of  the 
meeting,  but  his  long  abstinence  from  match  play  was  quite  apparent. 
Clothier  and  Johnson  had  little  trouble  in  disposing  of  them  in  four 
short    sets. 

The  match  between  Little  and  Larned  and  Clothier  and  Johnson  was 
close  from  beginning  to  end.  The  Philadelphia  team  was  the  first  to- 
get  under  way  and  annexed  the  first  set  after  twelve  games  had  been 
played.  Johnson  was  the  target  for  the  opposing  pair  and  was  fully 
equal  to  all  that  the  occasion  demanded.  It  was  not  until  the  middle 
of  the  second  set  that  he  began  to  weaken  and,  then,  despite  Clothier's- 
efforts  to  assist  his  youthful  partner,  Little  and  Larned  won  game  after 
game  with  the  loss  of  but  one  in  the  third  set.  The  fourth  set  pro- 
duced a  decided  reversal  in  the  play  of  Larned.  His  strokes  were  very 
uncertain,  and  Clothier,  by  covering  most  of  the  court,  succeeding  in 
routing  the  New  Yorkers  in  easy  fashion. 

It  was  anybody's  match  for  the  greater  part  of  the  fifth  set,  but 
Little's  game  acquired  a  sudden  brilliancy,  and  with  Larned  steadying 
greatly,  they  ran  out  the  match  with  two  straight  games  when  the  score 
stood    at    four    all. 

In  the  upper  half  R.  C.  Seaver  and  G.  T.  Putnam  managed  to  get 
away  with  the  third  set  of  their  match  with  Niles  and  Dabney,  but 
the    result    was    never    for    a    moment    in    doubt. 

The  fight  for  the  title  was  decided  on  Saturday,  July  24.  Niles  and 
Dabney  were  expected  to  give  Little  and  Larned  quite  a  battle,  but  an 
ultimate  victory  was  conceded  to  the  New  Yorkers.  Consequently,  it 
was  quite  a  surprise  when,  after  five  evenly  contested  sets,  the  Bostonians 
emerged  triumphant.  It  was  fast,  clean  tennis  all  through,  with  all  four 
men  in  good  form,  but  to  Niles  belongs  the  credit  of  victory.  He 
fairly  surpassed  himself,  and  gave  an  exhibition  of  all  round  ability, 
few  believed  he  possessed.  Little  and  Larned  had  never  before  played 
together  and  a  large  number  of  their  errors  was  due  to  poor  team  work, 
but  the  team  play  of  the  winners  was  mechanically  smooth  and  even. 
Their  old  tendency  to  stake  all  on  a  single  chance  of  ace  or  error  was 
missing,    but   their    strokes    were    by    no    means    too    cautiously    executed. 

Interest  in  the  preliminary  round  of  the  singles  was  centered  on  the 
match  between  N.  W.  Niles  and  G.  F.  Touchard,  but  the  close  fight  ex- 
pected did  not  materialize.  The  New  York  player  made  many  errors,  while 
Niles   played    a   fast,    steady    game.      The    Bostonian   won    the   first    set   6/4,

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  37 

pulled  out  the  second  from  3/5  and  0/40  and  ran  six  straight  games  in 
the  third.  Niles  played  all  his  tricks  well,  being  particularly  effective 
with  his  service  and  net  work.  With  the  exception  of  the  unexpected 
defeat  of  W.  M.  Hall  by  B.  S.  Blake,  there  were  no  other  noteworthy- 
features    of    the   round. 

The  first  round  was  full  of  incidents  and  good  tennis,  also  several 
upsets.  In  the  upper  half,  H.  Tallant  pulled  out  his  match  with  A.  S. 
Dabney,  Jr.,  after  the  latter  had  led  at  dl}),  6/1,  5/1.  The  Bostonian 
was  times  innumerable  within  a  point  of  winning,  but  Tallant  made 
several  splendid  gets,  and  safe  returns,  that  brought  the  score  back  to 
deuce.  He  ultimately  won  at  3/6,  1/6,  8/6,  6/2,  6/3.  H.  H.  Whitman, 
a  brother  of  the  ex-champion,  took  the  measure  of  F.  J.  Sulloway. 
The  latter  was  considered  a  sure  winner,  but  he  started  so  badly  that 
Whitman  ran  out  the  first  and  second  sets,  6/1,  6I2.  Sulloway  took 
the  next  two  6/3,  6/4,  but  his  efforts  caused  him  to  slow  down  in  the 
fifth.  Whitman  braced  and  ran  out  the  last  set,  6/4.  B.  M.  Grant,  of 
Atlanta,  went  down  before  G.  ]\I.  Church.  His  boyish  little  opponent, 
though  his  shots  lacked  pace,  played  a  steady  resourceful  game.  Grant 
took  the  first  set,  and  almost  landed  the  second.  Church  finally  won 
at    7/5,   and    the    next   two    easily,    both    at    6/1, 

The  championship  court  was  allotted  to  Clothier  and  Seaver.  The 
Philadelphian  won  the  first  two  sets  very  easily  at  6/0  and  6/3,  but 
played  carelessly  in  the  third.  Seaver  made  some  splendid  deep  drives, 
and  by  all  round  good  play,  won  the  set  at  8/6.  Clothier  came  to  the 
net  during  the  fourth  set  and  Seaver  was  unable  to  get  by  him.  The 
set  ended  quickly  with  one  game  for  the  Williams  man.  E.  P.  Larned 
and  J.  D.  E.  Jones  had  a  fast,  though  one-sided  set-to ;  most  of  the 
games  were  very  close,  but  Larned's  splendid  volleying  gave  him  a  big 
majority.  He  won  6/4,  6/0,  3/6,  6/1.  Great  interest  was  exhibited  in 
the  appearance  of  D.  F.  Davis,  but  although  he  won  his  match,  the 
once  great  player  showed  plainly  the  effect  of  his  long  absence  from 
the   game. 

The  sensation  of  the  second  round  was  the  result  of  the  LeRoy-Inman 
encounter.  LeRoy's  form  in  his  first  two  matches  was  not  encouraging, 
but  his  showing  against  Inman  was  extremely  disappointing.  The 
latter  played  remarkably  well.  His  volleying  was  good,  and  he  drove 
with  unusual  accuracy  and  speed.  LeRoy's  efforts  to  pass  him  proved 
in  vain,  'out  when  the  former  took  the  net  Inman  got  by  him  repeatedly 
and  he  misplayed  many  balls  that  he  should  have  returned.  The  score 
was  6/4,  6/3,  6/1.  Little  indulged  in  carelessness  that  at  least  made 
it  necessary  for  him  to  attend  strictly  to  business.  His  opponent,  A.  S. 
Pier,  played  a  steady,  slow  game  and  led  at  two  sets  to  one  before 
the  New  Yorker  settled  down.  When  he  did,  he  ran  twelve  straight 
games.  H.  Tallant  advanced  a  round  by  winning  three  short  sets  from 
W.  C.  Grant,  and  S.  C.  Millett  eliminated  G.  M.  Church  with  surpris- 
ing   ease.  | 

By  far  the  best  tennis  in  the  fourth  day's  play  was  the  fight  between 
Niles  and  Larned.  Niles  was  first  to  strike  his  gait  and  ran  out  the 
openinc^  set,  6/3.  Larned  took  the  second  by  a  fine  net  attack,  at 
6/4.  The  third  was  very  close.  At  four  all,  Larned  dropped  his  service 
and  Niles  led  at  40/15  on  the  tenth  game,  but  Larned  passed  him  by 
aces  twice  and  eventually  won  the  game.  He  continued  to  hold  his 
streak  for  the  following  two  games,  and  took  the  set,  7/5.  The  cham- 
pion's brother  led  for  a  time  in  the  fourth  set,  but  Niles  braced  and  by 
faster,  steadier  tennis,  took  it  at  6/4.  The  deciding  set  was  the  closest 
of  the  five.  Toward  its  end,  each  man  began  to  lose  his  service,  and 
Niles  was  four  times  within  a  point  before  pulling  out  at  8/6.  L.  E. 
Mahan  obtained  a  big  lead  against  D.  F.  Davis  before- the  veteran  crack 
got  well  started.  When  he  did  he  outclassed  the  tall  New  Yorker. 
The_  score  was  3/6,  _  4/6,  6/1,  6/1,  dlz-  Little  administered  a  terrific 
beating    to    Tallant,    in    which    the    latter    won    but    a    single    game,    and

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  39 

Millett  took  a  love  set  from  W.  F.  Johnson  before  the  Philadelphian 
got  under  way.  Inman,  R.  Bishop,  Clothier  and  Palmer,  all  won  their 
matches    easily. 

The  fourth  round  proved  the  Waterloo  of  Bishop  and  Davis  in  one 
half,  and  Johnson  and  Niles  in  the  other.  Inman  beat  Bishop  easily, 
and  Palmer  set  too  fast  a  pace  for  Davis.  For  one  set  Johnson  out- 
played Little,  but  the  latter  improved  rapidly  as  the  match  progressed 
and  won  at  2/6,  6/2,  6/3,  9/7.  The  best  match  was  played  between 
Clothier  and  Niles.  Clothier  was  the  better  for  two  sets,  but  Niles 
led  all  the  way  in  the  third,  which  he  won  6/4.  The  fourth  was  very 
close.  Niles  led  at  4/2,  but  , Clothier  ran  out  the  next  three  games. 
The  tenth  game  went  to  Niles^  but  he  went  off  then  and  Clothier  won 
the    following    two    easily.      Score,     6/4,     6/3,    4/6,    7/5. 

The  principal  attraction  in  the  next  round  was  the  meeting  of  Clothier 
and  Little.  The  latter  found  himself  quickly,  and  after  a  few  bad  errors, 
played  a  fast,  sure  game.  Clothier  trailed  him  all  the  way  and  lost  the 
set,  6/4.  The  second  set  went  to  the  Philadelphian.  He  came  to  the 
net  oftener  and  increased  the  pace  on  all  his  shots.  Little  improved 
during  the  third  set  and  jumped  into  a  good  lead.  Then  Clothier,  from 
1/3,  ran  four  straight  games.  Little  won  the  next  game  on  service 
and  evened  the  score  with  four  hne  aces  off  Clothier's  delivery.  Er- 
raticness  cost  him  the  following  two  and  the  set,  7/5.  The  fourth  set 
found  Little  becoming  wilder  right  along.  Clothier  played  steadily  but, 
largely  through  his  rival's  errors,  ran  out  the  set  6/2.  In  the  lower 
half  Palmer  took  Inman  into  camp  after  five  fast  sets.  Inman  played 
splendidly  until  the  last  set,  when  fatigue  made  him  almost  helpless. 
At  1/5  he  made  a  une  stand  and  took  four  games,  but  Palmer  ran  out 
the    match    with    the    next    two,    quite    easily. 

The  final  match  was  much  closer  than  it  was  thought  it  would  be. 
It  went  the  limit  of  five  sets  with  Palmer  leading,  at  two  sets  to  one. 
His  errors  and  anxiety  cost  him  the  fourth  set,  and  he  was  exhausted 
at  the  beginning  of  the  fifth.  Clothier  lost  the  opening  game  on  Palmer's 
service,  but  the  latter,  who  was  unable  to  run  because  of  a  stitch  in 
his  side,  was  helpless  during  the  rest  of  the  set.  At  1/5  he  again  _  won 
his  service,  but  Clothier  had  no  trouble  winning  his  own  in  the  eighth 
game. 

The  challenge  round  culminated  in  a  rather  odd  five  set  match. 
Larned,  although  suffering  from  an  injured  knee,  p.ayed  a  remarkable 
game.  His  strokes  were  so  perfectly  executed  and  placed  that  it  was 
not  necessary  for  him  to  cover  a  great  amount  of  court.  He  won  the 
first  two  sets  handily,  both  at  6/3.  During  that  time  the  champion 
exhibited  such  cunning  strategy  and  cleverness,  that  Clothier  seemed 
in  comparison,  little  more  than  a  beginner.  The  games  he  won  were 
largely  due  to  Larned's  unwillingness  to  exert  himself,  or  try  for  balls 
that  necessitated  quick  turning,  or  decisive  action.  Larned  kept  up 
his  marvelous  accuracy  and  speed  during  most  of  the  third  set.  At 
three  all  he  won  two  games  and  apparently  had  the  match  in  hand. 
Three  times  he  was  within  a  point  of  the  ninth  game,  but  Clothier's 
nerve  and  great  steadiness,  saveu  him  on  each  occasion.  At  five  all  he 
won  the  next  game,  but  Clothier  took  the  next  three  and  the  set,  8/6. 
Larned  began  with  a  rush  in  the  fourth  set,  but  though  the  first  two 
games  were  deuce  ones,  Clothier  won  them  both.  Then  the  champion 
suddenly  gave  up  all  attempt  to  wm.  He  loafed  around  the  base  line 
and  actually  made  no  effort  to  score.  Clothier  quickly  had  six  games 
and    his    second    set.      The   point    score    was    26/10. 

With  the  beginning  of  the  final  set,  Larned  again  made  a  determined 
stand,  but  Clothier  captured  the  initial  game.  The  next  four  all  went 
to  the  National  Title  Holder,  by  almost  flawless  play;  his  execution 
had  reached  its  height,  and  a  mistake  seemed  impossible  for  hirn. 
Clothier  banged  out  four  fine  drives  in  the  sixth  game,  but  it  was  his 
last  stand.  Larned  proceeded  with  his  apparently  invincible  streak  and 
the    match    ended    with    the    next    game.      The    summaries :

Western  Championship. 


On  July  24  the  premier  event  in  Western  tennis,  namely  the  Western 
■championship,  was  begun  on  the  fine  grass  courts  of  the  Onwentsia  Club 
of  Chicago.  It  was  the  twenty-second  anniversary  of  this  famous  tourna- 
ment, and  an  entry  list  of  seventy-two  players  was  recorded  in  a  draw 
which  was  unusually  well  divided.  Added  interest  was  created  by  the 
appearance  of  the  much-talked-of  Coast  players,  McLoughlin,  Long  and 
Bundy. 

The  first  match  of  importance  was  the  meeting  of  McQuiston  of  Mexico 
and  L.  H.  Waidner.  The  latter  was  within  a  point  of  each  set,  but  Mc- 
Quiston finally  pulled  out  at  11/9  and  7/5.  Waidner  lacked  steadiness, 
but   McQuiston  rarely  missed   or   took   big  chances. 

In  the  second  round  Long  just  squeezed  by  Trux  Emerson  in  two 
deuce  sets,  and  W.  T.  Hayes  won  easily  from  S.  M.  Sinsabaugh.  The 
fourth  round  proved  Hayes'  Waterloo,  where  he  was  beaten  by  Long  in 
straight  sets,  and  D.  Jones  fell  dismally  before  McQuiston.  The  real 
surprise  and  most  important  match  was  Bundy' s  triumph  over  McLough- 
lin. It  was  extremely  close  in  every  set,  but  McLoughlin  failed  utterly 
to  handle  Bundy's  service.  The  latter  smashed  splendidly  and  volleyed 
with  astonishing  severity  and  accuracy.  In  the  semi-final  round  Long 
romped  away  from  McQuistoUj  and  Bundy  took  R.  A.  Holden's  measure 
in  three  straight  sets.     The  third  was  very  close,  but  Bundy  had  a  fairly

•easy  time  in  the  first  two.  This  brought  the  tournament  to  the  final 
round  with  two  of  the  Californians  occupying  opposite  brackets.  The 
match  was  disappointing,  however,  for  Long  really  outclassed  Bundy.  The 
latter  was  not  off,  but  Long  probably  never  played  faster,  better  tennis 
than  he  did  that  day.  Every  stroke  he  tried  worked  perfectly  and  appar- 
ently he  did  not  know  how  to  miss.  Bundy  was  powerless  before  such  a 
game,  and  lost  to  the  tune  of  6/3,  6/3,  6/1. 

The  challenge  match,  played  on  Saturday,  was  much  more  of  a  con- 
test, though  here  again  Long  demonstrated  his  right  to  be  classed  with 
the  best.  Nat  Emerson,  the  title  holder,  forced  him  to  his  limit  but 
when  the  critical  moments  arrived.  Long  generally  came  out  on  top. 
Emerson's  great  steadiness  was  a  feature  of  the  play,  and  he  was  more 
than  a  match  for  Long  on  ground  strokes,  but  the  latter  ran  in  con- 
stantly, and  the  daring  he  displayed  in  his  net  game  brought  the  crowds 
to  their  feet  repeatedly.  The  first  two  sets  were  very  close,  both  going 
to  Long  at  9/7  and  7/5,  but  with  their  loss  Emerson  apparently  realized 
the  certainty  of  defeat,  for  he  practically  gave  up  the  fight  in  the  third 
and  last   set,  failing  to   score  a  game. 

The  doubles  title  fared  no  better  than  the  singles,  for  it,  too,  changed 
hands.  The  final  round  was  fought  out'  between  Emerson  and  Holden 
and  the  McOtiiston  brothers.  Although  the  former  team  won  the  score 
fails  to  indicate  how  hard  a  time  they  had  to  do  it.  A  large  number  of 
games  went  to  deuce  in  the  third  and  fourth  sets,  although  Emerson  and 
Holden   always  led. 

Both  teams  had  narrow  escapes  on  their  way  to  the  final  round.  Nat 
Emerson  and  L.  H.  Waidner  had  a  great  battle  with  Trux  Emerson  and 
Holden,  which  ended  after  four  extremely  close  sets,  three  of  which  went 
to  7/5,  and  W.  T.  Hayes  and  P.  Gardner  captured  the  first  two  sets  of 
their  match  with  the  McOuistons.  The  latter  team  won  finally  at  4/6, 
4/6,   6/3,   6/4,  6/4.      The  summaries:

Pacific  Coast  Championship. 

Del  Monte  was  the  scene  of  the  twentv-second  annual  tournament  for 
the  Pacific  Coast  championship  and  on  August  16  the  matches  began.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  45 

with  G.  Janes,  were  both  absent,  as  well  as  C.  Gardner,  T.  C.  Bundy 
and  S.  Sinsabaugh,  three  more  of  the  Golden  Gate's  strongest  men,  so 
that  not  only  did  the  singles  go  .by  default,  but  the  entry  was  far  from 
being  a  representative  one.  Nevertheless,  the  event  proved  quite  a  suc- 
cess, as  Janes,  a  former  coast  champion,  was  on  hand,  as  well  as  vete- 
rans Sumner  Hardy,   P.   Murdock  and  others. 

A  most  important  match  occurred  in  the  first  round  when  ex-cham- 
pion L.  J.  Freeman  and  R.  Hunt  clashed.  Hunt  ran  away  with  the  first 
set  and  almost  captured  the  second,  but  he  weakened  badly  in  the  third, 
which  Freeman  took  at  6/2.  Two  ex-holders  came  together  when  Free- 
man and  Janes  met  in  the  next  round  and  Janes  sprung  a  surprise  by 
winning  in  straight  sets.  Freeman  was  very  erratic,  while  Janes  played 
steadily  and  made  few  errors.  C.  Foley,  another  crack,  lost  miserably  fo 
R.   McSwain,  a  supposedly  inferior  man,  in  the  same  round. 

The  semi-final  round  went  as  expected,  in  straight  sets,  Janes  winning 
from  D.  Grant  easily,  and  C.  Rogers,  a  young  comer,  eliminating  Mc- 
Swain. Both  matches  produced  pretty  tennis,  but  the  results  were  never  in 
doubt.  The  final  and  championship  round  was  well  worth  seeing.  Rogers 
started  well  and  after  five-all  had  been  called,  hammered  out  the  necessary 
two  games.  This  started  Janes  in  earnest  and  he  settled  down  to  care- 
ful, hard  work.  The  remaining  three  sets  were  all  close  and  at  times 
exciting  to  a  degree,  but  at  the  crucial  moments,  Janes  was  the  more 
resourceful  and  in  the  end  won  out.  Rogers,  a  youngster  of  great  promise, 
was  a  bit  nervous  and  impetuous,  while  James'  greater  experienced  helped 
him   out  of  many  threatening  positions. 

Although  the  title  in  doubles  was  not  involved,  because  it  had  been 
played  for  in  July,  Janes  paired  with  Freeman,  came  through  and  in  the 
final  round  outclassed  Murdock  and  Hunt.  The  losers  almost  fell  before 
the  steady  play  of  E.  Finigan  and  H.  Hotchkiss,  and  again  in  the  semi- 
final Hardy  and  Duncan  forced  them  to  five  sets.  On  the  other  hand. 
Freeman  and  Janes  were  never  hard  pressed. 

The  women's  events,  always  a  big  factor  in  Coast  tennis,  were  well  up 
to  standard.  Miss  H.  Hotchkiss,  but  recently  returned  from  an  Eastern 
trip  during  which  she  won  the  National  Championship  at  Philadelphia, 
first  met  Mrs.  Bruce,  one  of  the  famous  Sutton  sisters,  and  had  her  hands 
full  to  win  in  two  deuce  sets.  Miss  Florence  Sutton  had  a  great  time  in 
beating  Miss  G.  Meyer.  The  latter  won  the  first  set  7/5,  but  just  failed 
to  land  the  second.      The  third  was  easy  for   Miss  Sutton. 

Miss  Florence  Sutton  and  Miss  Hotchkiss  met  in  the  final  round,  but 
the  latter  was  way  below  her  true  form.  She  made  many  errors  and  Miss 
Sutton  simply  resorted  to  steadiness  without  regard  for  aces  or  aggressive 
tactics.     In  the  end  Miss  Hotchkiss  beat  herself  by  her  repeated  errors. 

The  mixed  doubles  went  to  Hardy  and  Miss  HotchKiss,  who  took  Miss 
Sutton  and  Freeman  into  camp  in  straight  sets,  and  the  women's  doubles  to 
Miss  Hotchkiss  and  Miss  Meyer.  Miss  Sutton  and  Mrs.  Bruce  were  the 
runnel  s  up.     The  summaries  :

Pacific  States  Doubles  Championship. 

The  twenty-second  annual  tournament  to  decide  the  Doubles  Champion* 
ship  of  the  Pacific  States  was  held  on  the  new  cement  courts  of  the  Hotel 
Virginia,  Long  Beach,  Cal.,  on  July  i,  2,  3  and  5,  1909.  This  event  has 
usually  been  played  in  conjunction  with  the  singles  championship  tourna- 
ment, held  in  September,  at  Del  Monte,  but  in  order  that  the  winners 
might  reach  Lake  Forest,  111.,  in  time  to  compete  in  the  preliminary 
National  doubles  tournament,  beginning  August  2,  it  was  necessary  to 
set  an  earlier  date. 

There  were  nineteen  teams  entered,  among  which  were  the  best  talent 
in  Southern  and    Northern   California. 


48  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

The  best  match  in  the  preliminary  round  was  that  in  which  Freeman 
and  Holmes  defeated  Mace  and  Herd,  the  junior  team,  in  three  straight 
sets,  which  were  all  very  close.  The  first  round  brought  out  seven  good 
matches,  the  most  important  of  which  were  the  two  in  which  Browne  and 
Sinsabaugh  defeated  Rogers  and  Rogers,  and  Braly  and  Duncan  defeated 
Overton  and  Bumiller.  The  former  match  went  to  four  set's  before 
Browne  and  Sinsabaugh  succeeded  in  disposing  of  the  high  school  cham- 
pions, the  Rogers  Brothers,  the  score  being  6/2,  10/8,  3/6,  6/0.  In  the 
•other  match  Braly  and  Duncan  defeated  Overton  and  Bumiller  in  three 
•close,   hard-fought   sets  by  a   score   of  8/6,  6/4,   7/5. 

In  the  second  round,  Bell  and  Bundy  won  from  Bacon  and  Young,  dlz, 
6/4,  6/1,  while  Braly  and  Duncan  defeated  Noble  and  Dawson,  6/3,  4/6, 
6/2,  7/5.  Wayne  and  Variel  got  the  better  of  Freeman  and  Holmes,  but  it 
took  five  sets  to  decide  the  match,  the  score  being,  6/2,  6/3,  1/6,  2/6,  6/3. 
Browne  and  Sinsabaugh  defeated  Woodbury  and  Cawston,  9/7,  6/1,  6/4. 
A.  E.  Bell  and  T.  C.  Bundy  won  the  tournament  by  defeating  Brown  and 
Sinsabaugh  in  a  four-set  match,   6/4,  2/6,  6/4,  6/4. 

The  challenge  match  was  played  on  the  afternoon  of  July  5  before  an 
■enthusiastic  holiday  crowd,  which  filled  to  overflowing  the  grand  stand 
and  bleachers.  McLoughlin  and  Janes  were  a  little  slow  in  starting,  and 
Bell  and  Bundy  were  quick  to  take  the  lead,  winning  the  first  set  by  a 
score  of  7/5,  and  the  second  by  6/4.  At  this  juncture  McLoughlin  and 
Janes  went  into  the  third  set  to  make  the  fight  of  their  lives,  and  fhey 
quickly  ran  out  this  set,  61},.  Keeping  up  the  same  pace  they  won  the 
-fourth  set  by  the  same  score.  The  champions  continued  their  winning 
streak  and  quickly  established  a  lead  of  5/2  in  the  final  set.  Here  the 
challengers  broke  through  Janes'  service,  and  Bundy  won  his  next  service, 
making  the  score  5/4  in  favor  of  the  defenders.  In  the  tenth  game  Mc- 
Loughlin put  full  steam  into  his  service  and  won  the  game  at  15,  thus 
•ending  a  splendid  match. 


Southern   Championship. 

The  Atlanta  Athletic  Club  of  Atlanta,  Ga.,  was  the  scene  of_  the  cham- 
pionship of  the  South.  Play  began  on  July  5  for  the  twenty-third  holding 
■of  this  event,   and  the  challenge  match   was  decided  on   July    12th. 

Probably  no  previous  meeting  excited  so  great  an  interest,  for  many 
Western  and  Eastern  cracks  competed.  Most  prominent  of  these  were 
T.  R.  Pell  and  W.  C.  Grant  of  New  York,  J.  Wentzel  of  Cincinnati, 
and  the  Doyle  brothers,  C.  B.  and  H.  E.,  of  Washington.  That  both 
titles  were  in  grave  danger  was  certain,  but'  no  one  looked  for  so  com- 
plete   a   sweep  of   the   boards   as   actually   took  place. 

In  the  first  round  Pell  and  H.  E.  Doyle  drew,  and,  while  Pell  won  in 
straight  sets,  it  was  fast,  interesting  tennis.  Doyle  fought  like  a  fiend 
for  the  first  set  and  once  was  very  close  to  capturing  it,  but  Pell  played 
him  to  a  stands'-ill  in  the  second  set.  A  little  later  Grant  and  Wentzel 
clashed  and  the  New  Yorker  had  a  mighty  close  shave.  Largely  through 
overconfidence,  he  was  on  the  wrong  end  of  a  6/3  set  and  from  then  on 
was  pressed  to  the  limit.      The  score  was  3/6,  7/5,   7/5. 

Nothing  unusual  happened  in  the  second  round ;  W.  C.  Grant  defaulted 
in  the  third  and  B.  M.  Grant  of  Atlanta  forfeited  his  match  in  the  fourth 
round  to  C.  B.  Doyle.  In  the  semi-final  Doyle  won  very  easily  from 
E.  V.  Carter,  the  Southern  intercollegiate  champion,  and  Pell  accounted 
■for  C.   Y.  Smith  in  straight  sets. 

On  Saturday  Pell  and  Doyle  faced  each  other  for  the  right  to  challenge 
Nat  Thornton  for  the  title.  Doyle  was  oflf  like  a  shot.  He  quickly  ran 
the  score  up  to  4/1  and  eventually  took  the  set,  6/4.  The  second  set  was 
just  the   reverse.      Pell,   improving   steadily,   led   at   5/2    and   lost  the  eighth 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  49 

•game  before  evening  the  set  score.  It  was  agreed  previously  that  two  in 
three  sets  would  decide  the  match,  so  both  began  carefully  on  the  odd 
set.  It  was  even  up  to  two-all,  but  Pell  played  with  more  speed,  and 
by   running  in   consistently   ran   out   four   straight    games    and  the   set,    6/2. 

The  challenge  round  proved  a  great  disappointrnent  for  the  Southern, 
rooters.  Thornton,  realizing  he  must  do  or  die,  decided  to  die.  His  great 
fault  was  his  indecision.  Instead  of  sticking  at  the  net,  where  he  might 
have  at  least  made  it  interesting,  he  was  scared  ofif  by  four  or  five  fast 
drives  that  passed  him  clean.  He  decided  then  to  stay  in  the  back 
court,  but  the  result  was  even  more  disastrous.  Pell  outclassed  him  on 
ground  strokes  and  the  Southerner  was  helpless  in  his  efforts  to  beat 
them.  On  the  whole.  Pell  played  an  almost  errorless  game,  while  Thorn- 
ton was  erratic  and  far  from  his  best.  In  the  three  sets  he  got  two 
.games,   one   in   the   second   and   one   in   the   third. 

Three  teams,  namely,  the  Doyles,  Grant  and  Pell,  and  Grant  and  Thorn- 
ton, outclassed  the  balance  of  the  teams  in  do-.bles,  but  the  draw  found 
Grant  and  Thornton,  upon  whom  rested  the  hopes  of  the  Southerners, 
facing  the   Doyles  in   the   first   round. 

The  Atlanta  pair  started  with  a  rush,  and  oefore  the  spectators  had 
realized  what  was  happening,  led  at  5/0.  Then  the  Washington  team 
woke  up.  They  improved  so  rapidly  that  at  one  time  they  needed  but  a 
point  to  tie  the  score.  However,  the  Southerners  took  the  set  at  6/4. 
The  second  was  hard  fought,  but  the  brothers  finally  landed  it  at  6/3. 
Then  came  another  wearing  fight  for  the  lead.  Neither  team  had  any 
advantage  at  four-all.  Then  Grant's  service  failed  to  wi:.  his  game  and 
C.  B.  Doyle's  delivery  won  the  set  at  6/4.  The  fourth  and  last  set  was 
short  and  rather  one-sided.  The  Southerners  fell  off  rapidly  and  the 
•Capitol's  representatives  took  six  of  the  eight  games  played. 

From  then  on  the  Doyles  had  very  little  trouble  until  the  final  round. 
Hardy  and  Maginnis  took  a  set  from  them,  but  their  other  matches  were 
easily  won.  Pell  and  Grant  had  even  less  difficulty  in  coming  through 
and   all    their   opponents    were    disposed    of   in    straight    sets. 

The  final  round  was  played  Saturday,  and  the  crowd  that  watched  it 
•was,  for  the  South,  the  largest  in  its  history  of  the  game.  Excitement 
was    intense    and    conditions    for    play    ideal. 

Pell  started  in  badly,  due  to  poor  condition.  He  was  nervous  and 
very  erratic.  It  took  six  games  for  the  Doyles  to  perceive  this,  but  from 
three  all  they  ran  out  the  set  by  constant  play  to  Pell.  The  same  tactics 
gave  them  a  lead  of  4/2  in  the  second  set  before  Pell  braced.  At  four-all 
Grant  won  his  service  and  he  and  Pell  broke  through  "Connie's"  delivery 
for  the  set.  The  third  set  was  very  bitterly  contested,  but  at  four-all  the 
New  Yorkers  again  took  the  lead  and  H.  E.  Doyle  dropped  the  tenth 
and   last   game    with    a   double   fault    and    an    error. 

The  fourth  set  was  the  fastest  of  all.  The  Doyles  set  a  clip  which  left 
the  Easterners  far  in  the  rear.  They  managed  to  get  two  games  before 
the  set  score  was  tied  again.  That  streak  of  winning  carried  the  Washing- 
tonians  along  for  a  good  lead  in  the  fifth  and  deciding  set.  At  3/r  against 
them.  Pell  and  Grant  again  forged  ahead.  Then  C.  B.  evened  the  score 
at  four-all.  Pell  won  his  service  and  the  end  came  after  a  long  deuce 
game,  Doyle  serving.  It  was  a  splendid  match,  exciting  throughout,  and 
a  toss  up  till  the  last  ball  had  crossed  the  net.     The  summaries :

Middle  States  Championship. 

The  title  of  Middle  States  Champion  was  again  retained  by  a  Larned 
when  the  national  title-holder's  brother,  E.  P.,  successfully  defended  against 
W.  F.  Johnson  in  the  challenge  round  of  the  tournament,  held  on  the 
beautiful  turf  courts  of  the  Orange  Tennis  Club,  bouth  Orange,  N.  J,  The 
event  was  held  the  week  of  June  28,  and  splendid  weather  allowed  the  finish 
on  Saturday,  July  4.  R.  D.  Little,  N.  W.  Niles,  W.  F.  Johnson,  R.  H. 
Palmer  and  C.  M.  Bull,  Jr.,  all  competed,  and  repeated  upsets  made  the 
meeting  one  of  the  most  interesting  of  the  season. 

The  first  match  of  importance  occurred  when  Niles  and  Johnson  came 
together.  The  Bostonian  started  brilliantly  and  quickly  ran  out  the  first 
set,  6/1.  Johnson  failed  to  control  his  slow,  deceptive  chops  and  Niles 
volleyed  with  an  ease  that  was  remarkable.  The  second  set  marked  a 
chamge  in  Johnson's  play.  He  became  accurate  and  more  aggressive  and 
the  balls  slid  by  the  Harvard  captain  in  puzzling  fashion.  Niles  became 
bewildered  and  undecided  and  in  little  time  his  net  attack  had  been  com- 
pletely broken  up.  Johnson  kept  right  on  chopping  and  rarely  ran  in,, 
with  the  result  that  Niles  became  thoroughly  demoralized.  The  second  and 
third  sets  went  to  Johnson,  both  at  6/2. 

The  victory  brought  Johnson  to  the  semi-final  round,  which  his  next 
opponent,  R.  D.  Little,  had  reached  by  defeating  R.  H.  Palmer  in  a  one- 
sided, straight  set  match.  Palmer's  drives,  his  chief  stock  in  trade,  had 
failed  to  come  off,  and  Little  had  no  trouble  in  winning  at  6/2  and  6/3. 

The  Little-Johnson  match  produced  really  fine  tennis.  It  was  even  till 
at  four-all.  Johnson  slid  the  ball  repeatedly  by  Little  as  the  latter  came  in,, 
and  ran  out  the  set,  6/4.  The  second  set  was  even  closer.  Little  ran  the 
score  up  to  5/2  and  promptly  let  down.  This  temporary  respite  gave 
Johnson  the  opportunity  he  needed  and  in  no  time  the  score  was  five-all. 
It  was  too  late  to  make  amends,  however,  and  though  Little  tried  every 
method  to  stem  Johnson's  rush,  it  was  to  no  purpose,  "for  the  Philadelphian. 
sent  the  balls  skidding  over  with  such  tmerring  judgment  that  the  New 
Yorker  won   but   two   points   in   the  remainder  of   the   match. 

In  the  lower  half  of  the  draw.  Bull  had  won  straight  set  matches  from 
H.  Torrance,  W.  V.  Bennett,  J.  W.  Forney,  O.  H.  Hinck,  and  in  the  semi- 
final round  from  his  team-mate,  H.  Martin.  He  was  never  forced  to  his 
best  at  any  time,  but  the  match  with  Johnson,  contrary  to  expectations, 
revealed  qualities  in  his  play  hitherto  unexpected. 

It  was  played  on  Friday  and  went  the  limit,  five  long  sets.  A  more 
even  battle  would  not  have  been  possible  and  it  was  only  Bull's  weakening 
at  the  eleventh  hour  that  gave  Johnson  the  victory.  At  one  time  Bull  led 
at  two  sets  to  one  and  5/3,  but  Johnson's  nerve  pulled  him  out  of  that  bad 
hole  and  ultimately  won  the  set.  The  fifth  set  went  to  four-all  before 
Bull's  constant  running  in  began  to  waver.  He  was  completely  exhausted 
and  Johnson  had  no  difficulty  in  winning,  with  Bull  unable  to  reach  the 
net.  It  was  pretty  tennis  and  the  contrast  in  style  added  interest  to  the 
game.  The  constant  strain  of  running  in  made  a  huge  difference  in  the 
condition  of  the  men  as  play  progressed  and  at  the  end  Johnson  was  well 
able  to   continue,   while   Bull  was   in   very   poor   shape. 

The  challenge  round  found  Johnson  a  bit  stale  and  Larned  at  his  best. 
The  latter  played  a  magnificent  net  game,  while  Johnson  made  many  more 
errors  than  is  his  wont.  Only  in  one  set  did  the  Philadelphian  threaten 
the  winning  streak  of  the  Orange  expert.  That  was  in  the  third,  when  he 
forced  the  score  to  five-all,  but  Larned  ran  out  the  following  two  games- 
by  big  margins.     The  complete  score  was  6/2,  6/4,  7/5. 

The   doubles   wound   up   with   the   best   matcli   of   the   entire   week.      Niles. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  53 

and  Dabney  had  worked  their  way  to  the  final  round,  where  they  were  to 
have  met  O.  H.  Hinck  and  H.  Torrance,  but  an  injury  to  Torrance's  arm 
made  it  impossible  for  him  to  play,  and  the  match  went  by  default".  The 
Bostonians  had  won  two  well  earned  victories,  one  over  L.  E.  Mahan  and 
H.  Tallant,  and  the  other  from  R.  D.  Little  and  H.  H.  Hackett.  The 
latter  triumph  was  wholly  unexpected,  but  the  Harvard  team  never  played 
better  and  the  internationalists  were  never  within  striking  distance  of  the 
match. 

The  challenge  round  provided  the  sensatiotl  of  the  week.  W.  A.  Larned 
and  G.  L.  Wrenn,  Jr.,  defended  and,  though  successful,  were  seven  times 
within  a  point  of  losing  the  title.  They  started  badly  and  Niles  and  Dabney, 
playing  together  in  great  shape,  won  the  first  set,  6/3.  The  second  set  was 
a  walkover  for  the  Boston  team,  Larned  and  Wrenn  failing  to  score  a 
single  game.  With  two  sets  won,  the  challengers  forged  ahead  in  the 
third  till  the  score  stood  at  5/3.  Then  Larned  came  to  the  front.  Time 
after  time,  he  saved  the  game  with  sharp  smashes  and  clever  volleys  until 
at  twelve-all,  he  and  Wrenn  pulled  out  the  set  and  thereafter  were  never 
in  deep  water.  Niles  fired  quickly  and  the  match  ended  with  Larned  and 
Wren  victors  by  a  score  of  3/6,  0/6,   14/12,  6/4,  6/3. 

The  ladies'  singles  was  won  by  Miss  Louise  Hammond.  She  defeated 
Mrs.  G.  L.  Chapman  in  the  final  round  and  the  default  of  Miss  C.  B. 
Neely  gave  her  the  title.  Miss  Hammond  was  again  victorious  when  she 
•and  Mrs.  Chapman  won  the  doubles  from  Miss  E.  Wildey  and  Miss  S. 
Souther.     The  summaries :

Middle  West  Championship. 


The  ninth  annual  Middle  West  Championship  was  begun  August  16  on 
the  Omaha  Field  Club's  courts,  Omaha,  Neb.,  and  on  the  twenty-second, 
the  final  round  was  played. 

For  the  fourth  time  the  title  went  to  W.  T.  Hayes  of  Chicago,  who  de- 
feated R.  L.  Branson  of  Mitchell,  South  Dakota,  in  the  final  round.  The 
first  two  sets  were  very  close  affairs,  but  Hayes,  methodical  and  steady, 
wore  his  comparatively  inexperienced  opponent  down  and  _  won  the  third 
and  fourth,  6/3  and  6/1,  respectively.  Branson  played  brilliantly  at  times, 
but  was  erratic  and  easily  discouraged  by  Hayes'  tenacity  and  manner  of 
getting  every  ball  back.  The  match  decided  the  title,  for  the  holder,  C.  S. 
Peters,  did  not  defend. 

Hayes  and  P.  Gardner  won  the  doubles  in  a  very  close,  interesting  four- 
set  match  from  Branson  and  Barton,  but  the  surprise  of  the  week  was  the 
rub  the  winners  were  given  in  the  previous   round  by  the   Oklahoma  team,

Bailey  and  Speice.  The  latter  combination  forced  Hayes  and  Gardner  to 
five  sets,  and  were  within  two  points  of  the  match  in  the  fourth.  The  fact 
that  the  Oklahoma  pair  was  not  conceded  a  chance,  intensified  the  excite- 
ment and  made  them  big  favorites  with  the  large  number  of  spectators.

The  International  Championship  at  Niagara-on-the-Lake. 

Commencing  August  21,  the  famous  old  courts  of  the  "Queens  Royal,"' 
at  Niagara-on-the-Lake,  were,  as  usual,  the  scene  of  the  annual  interna- 
tional championships.  The  number  of  entrants  was  a  record  breaking 
one.  Miss  May  Sutton,  R.  D.  Little,  B.  C.  Wright  and  G.  Janes  and 
S.  M.  Sinsabaugh,  the  latter  two  from  Caluornia,  were  among  the  better 
known  experts  ■  who  took  part,  as  well  as  a  large  number  of  players 
from    Canada    and    United    States    of    lesser    note. 

In  the  men's  singles,  Janes  and  Sinsabaugh,  Nash  of  Cleveland,  and 
Baird  of  Toronto,  came  through  to  the  semi-final  round.  Against  Sinsa- 
baugh, Nash  was  unable  to  accomplish  anything,  and  was  beaten  by  the 
one-sided  score  of  6/1,  6/0.  Baird  made  a  much  better  showing  against 
Janes,  although  on  the  deciding  set  he  fell  down  badly.  The  Californian 
took  the  first  set  6/3.  His  shots  were  so  fast,  and  his  game  so  thor- 
oughly aggressive  that  Baird  seemed  confused  and  unable  to  settle  down. 
In  the  second  set  he  got  going  better  and  finally  pulled  out  at  9/7. 
The  loss  of  this  set  only  spurred  Janes  on  to  greater  efforts,  and  Baird 
was  buried  under  an  avalanche  of  drives  and  smashes  that  left  him 
without  a  game  at  the  conclusion  of  the  deciding  set'.  The  final  match 
between  Janes  and  Sinsabaugh  was  defaulted  by  the  latter,  when  Janes- 
was  leading  by  6/4  and  6/3.  Janes  then  proceeded  to  play  the  holder 
of  the  title,  N.  W.  Niles,  later  in  the  day,  but  as  he  had  participated 
in  two  final  matches  just  previous  to  the  challenge  match,  he  was  quite 
incapable  of  playing  in  top  form.  His  strokes  lacked  the  snap  and 
sting  which  are  their  principal  characteristics  under  ordinary  circum- 
stances, and  Niles,  who  was  fresh  and  in  good  condition,  had  a  walk- 
over in  defeating   his   tired   opponent.      The   score  was   6/1,   6/1,   6/1. 

The  doubles  tournament  proved  extremely  interesting.  In  the  early 
rounds  there  were  plenty  of  close  contest's,  but  the  teams  that  reached 
the  semi-final  were  easily  the  best  of  the  twenty-four  combinations  that 
entered.  In  the  lower  half,  Janes  and  Sinsabaugh  beat  Niles  and  H.  D. 
Kirkover ;  they  were  expected  to  win,  but  not  by  the  onesided  score  of 
6/1,  6/1.  The  losers  were  not  in  the  best  of  form,  but  the  Californians 
were  so  fast  that  it  would  not  have  made  much  difference.  The  other 
match,  that  between  Wright  and  Little,  and  Baird  and  Glassco,  was. 
far  more  interesting.  The  Canadian  team  made  an  effort  in  the  first 
set  which  very  nearly  succeeded  and  were  only  beaten  after  sixteen  games 
had  been  played.  The  second  set  was  the  fastest  of  the  three.  Glassco 
and  Baird  fairly  smothered  their  Eastern  rivals,  running  five  straight 
games  and  the  set  at  6/3.  _  They  led  at  2/1  and  1I2  in  the  third,  but 
at  that  point  Wright  got  into  the  game  with  a  vengeance,  and  Little- 
and  he  quickly  banged  out  four  games  and  the  match.  The  best  tennis, 
of  the  week  developed  in  the  final  doubles.  It  was  fast,  snappy  play 
frorn  start  to  finish,  and  the  terrific  speed  of  the  Westerners,  with. 
^Wright's  clever  shots  and  remarkable  gets  and  Little's  splendid  volley- 
ing kept  the  spectators  in  continuous  excitement.  It  was  anybody's 
match  until  the  last  point  had  been  played,  but  the  more  careful  play 
of  the  Eastern  men  at  critical  stages,  gave  them  the  win  at  6/4,  8/6,   6/4. 

Before  fhe  ladies'  singles  had  begun  the  event  was  generally  con- 
ceded   to    lie   between    Miss    Sutton    and    Mrs.    J.    H.    Hannam,    and    so    if

turned  out.  Mrs.  Hannan,  nee  Miss  Edith  Boucher,  had  previously  met 
Miss  Sutton  in  •  the  English  championships,  and  a  great  battle,  which 
finally  went  to  the  American  girl,  was  the  result  of  the  encounter.  Since 
then  Mrs.  Hannam  had  greatly  improved,  and  before  her  trial  with  Miss. 
Sutton  began  she  had  nearly  as  many  supporters  as  the  Pasadena  expert. 
But  the  match,  while  interesting,  was  never  in  doubt.  Miss  Sutton 
proved  her  greater  ability  in  unmistakable  fashion.  She  held  the  upper 
hand  throughout  and  won  at  6/3,  6/3.  Although  Mrs.  Hannam  was  ex- 
tremely nervous  and  played  far  below  her  usual  standard,  her  victor 
was  admitted  by  all  who  saw  the  play,  to  be  her  superior.  Miss  Sutton's 
victorious  path  was  blocked  a  bit  later,  however,  by  Mrs.  Hannam  and 
Miss  Steever.  Miss  Sutton  played  with  Miss  C.  B.  Neely,  but  Mrs. 
Hannan  and  Miss  Steever  beat  them  rather  easily  at  6/1,  6/4.  The  real 
surprise  of  the  meeting^  was  Miss  Sutton's  defeat,  with  Sinsabaugh,  in. 
the  mixed  final.  The  Californians  have  played  much  together  and  were 
thought  to  have  had  the  honors  at  their  mercy,  but  Mrs.  Hannam,  for 
the  second  time,  was  the  obstacle  in  the  way.  She  and  R.  Baird  won  in 
a  long  three  set  match.  The  play  throughout  was  very  close,  long 
rallies  followed  in  rapid  succession,  and  the  score  of  6/z,  2/6,  6/2,  fails, 
utterly   to   indicate  the   evenness   of  the   play.     The   summaries:

New  England  Championship. 

For  the  third  successive  year  the  title  of  New  England  Champion  will 
be  borne  by  T.    R.    Pell. 

The  tournament,  now  one  of  the  oldest  in  existence,  was  begun  on  the 
Hartford  Golf  Club's  courts,   June  8,  and  ended  July   12. 

The  entry  was  about  as  usual,  except  for  the  absence  of  H.  L.  Westfall, 
who  twice  challenged  Pell,  and  the  appearance  of  G.  F.  Touchard  and 
F.  C.  Inman  of  New  York.  In  the  first  round,  Lnman  had  a  hard  fight 
with  G.  H.  Nettleton,  but  not  until  F.  W.  Cole  v\^on  from  W.  C.  Grant 
did  much  of  interest  occur.  Grant  played  listlessly  in  that  match  and  Cole 
won  quite  easily  at  6/1,  7/5.  In  the  second  round  Inman  and  Touchard 
met  and  a  close,  three  set  match  resulted.  Inman  was  a  bit  wild  and, 
from  three-all  in  the  third  set,  Touchard  ran  out  the  match,  aided  greatly 
by   Inman's  errors. 

The  next  roimd,  the  semi-final,  was  decided  in  two  three-set  matches. 
L.  Perry,  who  just  nosed  out  J.Terry  in  the  closest  match  of  the  event  in 
the  round  before,  took  the  measure  of  R.  H.  Cole,  after  dropping  thcfirst 
set,  6/1.  Perry  passed  Cole  time  and  again  and  was  considerably  steadier. 
Cole  lost  many  points  by  failing  to  get  pace  to  his  shots  and  Perry  made 
many  returns  of  the   Hartford  man's   weak  attempts  to  kill. 

In  the  lower  half,  F.  W.  Cole  succumbed  to  Touchard,  but  not  before 
that  player  had  come  very  close  to  defeat.  It  was  about  even  for  the  first 
two  sets,  but  with  the  third,  Cole  jumped  into  a  lead  of  three  games. 
Touchard  played  with  great  caution  from  then  on  and  was  rewarded  by  a 
succession  of  si.x  games. 

The  final  round  produced  some  very  good  and  much  very  bad  tennis. 
Touchard  never  caught  up  to  Perry,  who  was  playing  splendidly  in  the 
first  set,  but  ran  out  the  second  and  third  at  6/3,  6/2.  The  fourth  was  a 
walkover  for  the  Williams  Professor,  but  the  deciding  set  was  almost  as 
easy  for  the  New  Yorker.  Perry  was  not  in  very  good  shape  physically 
and  was  compelled  to  slow  up  at  times.  Had  he  been  better  trained  it  is 
doubtful  if  Touchard  could  have  won  with  ease. 

The  challenge  round  brought  out  quite  a  large  gallery,  but  they  were 
treated    to    little    good    play.      Pell    started    nervously.      Principally    on    his 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  61 

errors,  Touchard  was  enabled  to  get  away  with  the  first  set,  6/4.  Then 
the  tables  turned-  Touchard,  for  no  apparent  reason,  indulged  in  a  series 
of  errors  and  poor  judgment  that  ended  only  when  Pell  had  again  become 
champion.  This  streak  encouraged  from  the  beginning,  the  title-holder  so 
that  he  improved  decidedly  and  almost  outclassed  Touchard  in  the  last 
two  sets. 

The  doubles,  with  Pell  and  Grant  entered,  turned  out  as  expected,  for 
no  other  combination  was  able  to  even  extend  them.  Touchard  and  Inman 
defaulted  so  that  Pell  and  Grant  faced  Nettleton  and  Perry  in  the  final. 
It  was  an  interesting,  well  played  match,  but  with  the  New  Yorkers  coming 
out  on  top  after  most  of  the  rallies  and  Perry  and  Nettleton  always  hope- 
lessly behind.     The  summaries :

Tri-State  Championship  (Ohio,  Indiana  and  Kentucky). 

One  of  the  most  valuable  trophies  ever  offered  for  a  championship  was 
won  outright  when  the  DeCamp  Bowl,  emblematic  of  the  Tri-State  Title, 
was  captured  for  the  third  successive  time  by  Robert  Le  Roy.  This  im- 
portant event  was  begun  August  28  at  the  Cincinnati  Lawn  Tennis  Club 
and  the  challenge  match  was  played   September   6. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  63 

Nat  Emerson,  last  year's  challenger,  again  came  through  the  tournament 
and  for  the  second  time  was  defeated  by  Le  Roy.  The  match  was  ex- 
tremely close,  but  Le  Roy,  always  a  master  of  tactics,  played  better  tennis 
in  the  fifth  set  than  in  the  first,  and  though  Emerson  won  three  games, 
Le  Roy  led  at  4/1  and  5/2  before  his  Western  opponent  won  his  third 
and  last  game  of  the  match.  Le  Roy's  fine  driving  but  weak  net  game 
was  just  the  reverse  of  Emerson's  style.  The  latter  rushed  constantly  to 
the  net,  but  too  often  the  Kew  Yorker's  shots  found  their  way  by  him, 
and  on  ground  strokes  Emerson  was  outclassed.  Moreover,  Emerson's 
efforts  to  draw  the  champion  to  the  net  were  all  in  vain,  for  in  strategy  he 
was  no  match  for  the  Easterner.  Interest  was  enhanced  by  the  entry 
of  C.  R.  Gardner,  California's  third  best  man,  but  surprise  was  boundless 
when  Nat  Thornton,  ex-Southern  Champion,  beat  him  rather  easily.  R.  H. 
Palmer  gave  Emerson  a  great  fight  in  the  semi-final  round,  but  at  two 
sets-all  slumped  decidedly.  The  first  two  sets  were  very  even,  one  to 
each  man  at  8/6.  Palmer  won  the  third,  by  splendid  drives  and  well-timed 
lobs,  but  Emerson  played  a  flawless  net  game  in  the  fourth,  which  he 
won  at  6/3.  The  deciding  set  was  as  close  as  its  predecessors.  Emerson 
rapidly  advanced  until  the  score  stood  at  5/2.  Then  Palmer  made  repeated 
passes  and  fast  deep  drives,  which  changed  the  score  to  5/4.  The  next 
and  last  garne  was  too  much  for  the  New  Jersey  expert,  who  hit  the  net 
four    successive    times,    Emerson    serving. 

The  final  round  brought  Emerson  and  his  old  team  mate  L.  H.  Waidner 
together.  Emerson,  as  usual,  had  the  better  of  this  argument,  but  with 
an  ease  in  great  contrast  to  the  general  tone  of  their  meetings.  Waidner 
played  below  the  form  he  usually  exhibits  and  lost  the  match  in  straight 
sets,   8/6,  6/4,   6/1. 

Palmer  and  Gardner  were  the  triumphant  combination  in  doubles.  They 
met  with  little  serious  opposition  until  the  final  round,  when,  for  the 
opening  set,  they  were  outplayed  by  Trux  Emerson  and  R.  H.  Holden. 
The  latters'  stand  was  shortlived,  however,  for  the  next  three  sets  went 
to  Palmer  and  Gardner,  the  last  at  6/0.  Miss  E.  Hannam  and  L.  Mitchell 
were  the  victors  in  the  mixed  doubles,  winning  the  title  from  Miss  L. 
Root  and  Nat  Thornton  in  a  rather  one-sided  three-set  match.  The  sum-

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  65 

Northwestern    Championship. 

The  eighteenth  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  North- 
west was  held  at  the  Minnetonka  Yacht  Club,  Deephaven,  Lake  Minna- 
tonka,  Minnesota.  It  began  on  July  19  and  continued  through  the  re- 
mainder   of   the    week. 

In  singles  the  entries  list  was  not  only  large,  but  was  representative 
of  almost  every  section  of  the  country  west  of  Chicago.  Among  the 
better  known  players  were  the  McQuistons  from  Mexico,  Nat  Emerson 
from  North  Yakima,  Wash.,  L.  H.  Waidner  of  Chicago,  who,  together 
with  the  California  team,  consisting  of  M.  E.  McLoughlin,  M.  H.  Long 
and  G.  Janes  of  ban  Francisco  and  T.  C.  Bundy  and  S.  M.  Sinsabaugh 
of  Los  Angeles  combined  to  make  this  tournament  by  far  the  most  event- 
ful  ever    held    in    the    Northwest. 

Interest  centered  upon  the  Californians  at  the  outset,  especially  as  it 
was  their  first  appearance  in  any  tournament  this  side  of  the  Rocky 
Mountains,  and  the  first  time  that  any  of  the  five  players  had  ever  played 
on  turf  courts.  It  was  evident  that  none  of  the  local  players  could  with- 
stand the  severe  attack  of  these  men,  which,  combined  with  their  accuracy 
and  fine  knowledge  of  the  game,  was  a  revelation  to  the  followers  of 
tennis. 

Sinsabaugh  was  the  first  to  meet  defeat,  H.  M.  McQuiston  winning 
from  him  in  straight  sets,  and  in  the  next  round  Bundy  defeated  Janes 
in   two   extremely   close   set's    at    13/11,    8/6. 

The  ^emi-final  round  brought  McLoughlin  and  Bundy  and  Long  and 
Waidner  together.  In  his  match  with  Long  Waidner  took  the  second  and 
third  sets,  and  the  first  two  games  on  the  fourth  set.  At  this  point, 
however.  Long  collected  himself,  which,  combined  with  a  slight  "let 
down"  on  the  part  of  Waidner,  enabled  him  to  win  out  the  fourth  and 
the  fifth   sets.      Score,   6/4,    5/7,   2/6,   6lz,  6/3. 

In  his  match  with  Bundy,  McLoughlin  had  a  slight  advantage  through- 
out, although  Bundy,  by  brilliant  playing,  took  the  second  set.  Score, 
6/3,   7/9,    6/1,    6/3. 

This  brought  the  two  old  rivals,  Long  and  McLoughlin,  together  in 
the  finals,  'the  match  proved  to  be  all  that  was  expected,  and  the  large 
gallery  was,  for  more  than  two  hours,  treated  to  the  sensation  of  the 
tournament. 

Long,  after  breaking  through  his  opponent's  service  on  the  thirteenth 
game,  won  the  following  game  and  set,  8/6.  In  the  second  set,  by 
increasing  his  speed,  he  led  all  the  way,  winning,  6/4.  The  third  set  was 
the  deciding  set,  and  although  Long  was  thrice  within  a  point  of  the 
match,  McLoughlin  won  out,  9/7.  This  was  the  turning  point,  after 
which  McLoughlin  was  irresistible,  winning  the  two  following  set's  and 
the  match,    6/8,   4/6,   9/7,   6/3,   6/2. 

Against  Emerson  in  the  championship  round,  McLoughlin  proved  in 
every  way  superior,  though  the  former  was  not  up  to  his  top  form. 
McLoughlin's  service  was  a  puzzle  to  the  former  champion,  and  that 
combined  with  an  overhead  game  that  was  beyond  criticism  enabled  the 
Californian   to   win  in    straight   sets  at   6/1,  6/4,   7/5. 

In  the  doubles  tournament  interest  centered  about,  the  McQuistons, 
champions  of  Mexico ;  Emerson  and  Waidner,  twice  champions  of  the 
West,  and  the  two  California  teams,  especially  McLoughlin  and  Janes. 

The  great  surprise  of  the  event  was  the  defeat  of  Emerson  and  Waid- 
ner, who,  after  winning  the  first  two  sets  with  comparative  ease,  lost  to 
Bundy  and  Sinsabaugh  by  a   score  of  2/6,  ilG,  6/1,   6/1,   6/4. 

In  the  other  half  McLoughlin  and  Janes,  after  a  well  contested  three- 
set  match  with  McQuiston  brothers,  won  by  the  score  of  7/5,  6/3,  6/4. 

The  final  match  between  the  two  Californian  teams  was  rather  one- 
sided, though  at  times  brilliantly  played.  Owing  to  the  nervousness  of 
Janes,  the  Pacific  champions  lost  the  first  set,^  but  thereafter  were  never 
in  danger,  the  final  score  being   1/6,  7/5,  6/0,  6/3.     The  summaries: —

Mid-Atlantic    Championship. 

New  and  consequently  poor  conditioned  courts,  abominable  weather,  and 
an  entry  list  far  below  the  standard,  both  in  class  and  numbers,  were  the 
inauspicious  circumstances  under  which  the  fifth  annual  Mid-Atlantic  Cham- 
pionship was  begun  at  the  Bachelors'  Tennis  Club  of  Washington,  D.  C. 

As  with  most  events  in  which  they  enter,  the  Doyle  family  again  estab- 
lished their  pre-eminence.  H.  E.  Doyle  played  through  the  tournament, 
winning  easily  from  every  opponent,  until  he  reached  the  final  round. 
There  he  faced  P.  Cake,  and  the  latter  won  the  first  set.  Then  Doyle  im- 
proved and  ran  three  sets  quite  easily.  There  was  no  challenge  match,  for 
Doyle   defaulted  to   his    brother    Connie. 

A.  Howard  and  C.  F.  Graves  surprised  everyone  by  eliminating  H.  Deis 
and  R.  Hills,  when  the  losers  had  been  predicted  the  Doyles'  challengers. 
It  was  a  very  close  tussle,  but  Hills  and  Deis  were  not  so  steady  as  usual 
and  let  pass  several  opportunities  to  win  the  match.  Against  the  Doyles, 
Howard  and  Graves  made  no  headway.  It  was  fa^t,  pretty  tennis,  but  the 
holders  were  not  forced  to  very  great  efforts.  Miss  Doolittle  won  the 
women's  singles  from  Miss  Doyle  in  three  fast  sets.     The  summaries :

Missouri  Valley  Championship. 

Although  the  number  of  contestants  was  not  so  large  as  in  past  years, 
the  Missouri  Valley  Tournament  for  1909,  played  at  the  Kansas  City 
Athletic  Club's  courts  August  23-28,  was  a  decided  success,  there  being 
among  the  entries  many  crack  players.  Drummond  Jones  of  St.  Louis, 
the  winner  of  the  Central  States  tournament  at  St.  Louis,  and  also  of  the 
Inter-State  tpurnament  of  St.  Joseph,  Mo.,  carried  off  the  honors  in 
singles,  and  with  Herbert  V.  Jones  of  the  Kansas  City  Athletic  Club  won 
the  championship  in  doubles.  Jones  played  a  much  stronger  and  faster 
game  in  1909  than  previously,  and  his  control  of  the  ball,  both  fore  and 
backhand,   was  well-nigh  perfect. 

Harry  H.  Brewster  of  St.  Joseph,  the  former  title  holder,  did  not  play 
up  to  his  standard  of  former  years,  and  so  fell  rather  easily  before  the 
steady   and   accurate  game   of  Jones  in  the   challenge   round. 

Much  disappointment  was  felt  when  Paul  Gardner  of  Chicago  sprained 
an  ankle  so  badly  that  he  was  unable  to  finish  his  match  with  Jones  in 
the  final  round.  The  followers  of  the  game  had  predicted  a  battle  royal 
between  these  two  experts,  but  Gardner  was  forced  to  retire  "fter  two 
sets   of   play. 

D.  and  H.  V.  Jones  went  through  the  entire  tournament  in  doubles 
without  losing  a  set,  in  spite  of  the  fact  they  had  never  before  played 
together.      The   summary :

Central  States  Championship. 

Played  at  the  Triple  A  courts,  Forest  Park,  St.  Louis,  July  5-1 1.  The 
Central  States  championship  went  to  Drummond  Jones,  the  clever  Mis- 
souri player.  He  defeated  Charles  S.  Peters  of  Chicago  in  the  final 
round,  6/1,  7/5,  6/4.  This  pair  hitched  up  for  the  final  round  in  doubles 
and  defeated  Paul  Gleeson  of  St.  Louis  and  Orrie  Vernon  of  St.  Joseph, 
6/2,  9/7,  6/0.  Jones  and  Peters,  although  the  tennis  on  both  sides  was 
mediocre,   were   better  generally  than  their  rivals. 

The  particularly  spectacular  match  of  this  tournament  was  played  be- 
tween Peters  and  Senor  Serrano  on  a  slow  Court.  Peters  had  appeared 
in  two  singles  and  a  doubles  match  previous  to  meeting  Serrano.  The 
''Man  from  Mexico"  gave  Peters  a  hard  fight  in  the  deciding  set  and 
seemed  to  have  the  Chicagoan  up  in  the  air  when  he  took  three  of  the 
first  five  games.  Peters  asked  for  time  to  change  rackets  and  then,  by 
excellent  generalship,  pulled  himself  out  of  the  hole  and  won.     His  victory

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  73; 

Pacific  Northwest  Championship. 

Because  of  the  non-appearance  of  F.  T.  Payne  and  W.  A.  McBurney, 
Jos.  C.  Tyler  had  quite  an  easy  time  in  the  annual  Pacific  Northwest 
Championship  which  took  place  during  the  first  week  in  August  at  the 
Tacoma  Lawn  Tennis  Club.  The  tight  for  supremacy  among  these  three 
men  is  always  a  fierce  one,  and  much  disappointment  was  felt  when  it 
became  known  that  McBurney  and   Payne  had  not  entered. 

Although  Tyler's  success  was  generally  expected,  it  was  threatened  in 
the  semi-final  round  by  a  player  until  then  unknown.  He  was  A.  Dorman, 
and  for  two  fast  hard  sets  he  gave  Tyler  all  he  could  do.  The  winner's 
steadiness  was  demonstrated  in  each  set  when  Dorman  had  big  leads.  The 
score  was   8/6,   7/5. 

Russell  and  Tyler  met  in  the  final,  but  Russell  was  out-classed.  Tyler 
won  as  he  chose   by  a  score  of  6/1,   6/1,   6/4. 

The  doubles  went  to  Russell  and  Fitz  after  five  exciting  sets.  Gorrill 
•and  Breeze  were  the  victims  but  Breeze  tired  badly  toward  the  end  and 
Gorrill   was   not   equal   to  the   extra   work   required   of   him. 

The  women's  event  resulted  in  a  walkover  for  Miss  Hotchkiss  of  Cali- 
fornia. Not  one  of  her  opponents  won  more  than  a  single  game  from  her, 
nor  was  Miss  A.  Ryan,  whom  she  met  in  the  final  round,  an  exception.

Tri-State  Championship  (Iowa,  South  Dakota,  Nebraska). 

Walter  Hayes  of  Chicago  by  his  fourth  consecutive  victory  in  the  "Three- 
State"  tennis  championship  played  at  Sioux  City,  August  9  to  15,  retained  his 
title  of  champion  of  Iowa,  South  Dakota  and  Nebraska.  Inasmuch  as  he 
had  won  outright  the  previous  cup,  his  name  was  first  to  be  engraved  on 
the  new  trophy.  Play  in  this  eleventh  annual  championship  was  marked 
by  the  most  satisfactory  competition  in  its  history.  Hayes'  victory  over 
Ray  L.  Branson,  in  the  challenge  round,  at  7/5,  7/5,  6/3,  was  expected 
although  his  South  Dakota  rival  brought  cheers  from  the  gallery  in  more 
than  one  of  his  matches  and  particularly  by  his  uphill  fight  with   Hayes. 

However,  Branson  had  his  revenge  in  the  doubles  title  match,  for  he 
and  his  partner,  John  Barton  of  Sioux  Falls,  defeated  the  holders,  Hayes 
and  W.  E.  "Doc"  Blatherwick.  Four  sets  were  necessary  to  decide  this 
title.  Time  and  again  the  South  Dakotans  showed  remarkable  form,  out- 
ulassing  their  rivals  and  Hayes  weakened  decidedly  by  their  attack. 

The  score  was  6/3,  6/4,  1/6,  6/4.  Roy  King  won  the  consolation  singles 
and  Van  Dyke  and  Lynch,  the  consolation  doubles.     The  summaries :

MISS  MAY  SUTTON. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  ^^ 

State    Championships 


California  State  Championship. 


Unusual  interest  was  taken  in  this  event  as  every  one  realized  that  it 
would  be  the  last  tryout  held  in  the  northern  section  of  this  state  before 
the   selection   of  the  players  to   represent   California   in   the    East. 

The  tournament  commenced  on  the    i6th  of  June  and  ended  on  the   19th. 

The  entry  list  represented  about  all  the  talent  on  the  coast,  and  some 
sensational  matches  resulted.  Long  had  an  easy  time  with  Robert  Strachan 
and  Bell  reached  the  semi-finals  with  an  easy  match  and  a  default.  Bundy 
defeated  Clarence  Al.len  and  E.  P.  Finigan,  thereby  reaching  the  semi-final.'s 
in  the  lower  half. 

Gardner  defeated  Major  Bethel  and  Allen  V.  Duncan,  but  not  without 
a  hard  struggle  with  the  latter.  It  looked  bad  for  him  in  the  third  and 
deciding  set  when  Duncan  led  at  5/3  and  30/15,  but  Gardner  pulled  out 
and   finally  won   the   set  and   match,   3/6,   6/4,   9/7. 

A.  E.  Bell,  of  Los  Angeles,  put  up  a  remarkably  strong  game  against 
Coast  Champion  M.  H.  Long,  defeating  iiim  i.i  straight  sets.  The  first 
was  close  and  hard  fought.  In  the  second  set  Bell  improved  while  Long, 
unnerved  by  his  inability  to  break  through  Bell's  service,  lost  control  of 
his  own   and   Bell   won  the   set  and  match,   8/6,   6/2. 

Gardner  was  again  forced  to  a  hard  match  when  he  met  Bundy,  although 
he  won  in  straight  sets.  In  the  first  Bundy  led  at  4/2.  Gardner  evened 
the  score  and  won  the  set,  after  a  9/7  struggle.  In  the  second  set  Bundy 
led  at  5/4  and  40/15.  But  Gardner's  luck  was  with  him.  He  won  the  game 
and  finally   the   set   and   match,   9/7,   7/5. 

The  finals  between  Gardner  and  Bell  was  held  the  following  morning. 
They  started  out  at  a  furious  pace ;  Bell's  net  work  was  splendid  and  he 
won  the  set,  6/4.  Bell  slackened  his  pace  in  the  second  set  while  Gardner 
came  back  strong,  winning  the  set  6/3.  In  the  third  set  both  men  showed 
the  effect  of  the  pace  at  which  they  were  going  and  the  heat  added  to  their 
discomfort.     At  4/4,   Gardner   broke  through  and   took  the   set,    6/4. 

A  short,  but  much  needed  rest  was  taken  before  the  fourth  set.  Both 
men  came  out  much  refreshed  and  played  so  even  that  neither  had  any 
advantage  except  on  his  service  up  to  4/4.  Gardner  made  it  5/4.  But 
this  time  it   was   Bell's   turn   and   he   quickly   ran   out   the   set  7/5. 

Bell  kept  on  going  for  three  more  games  in  the  fifth  set,  but  he  could 
not  stand  the  pace  and  Gardner  took  six  straight  games  and  the  match, 
4/6,   6/3,   6/4,    5/7,   6/3. 

The  afternoon  was  reserved  for  the  final  match  in  doubles  between  Long 
and  Gardner  and  Bell  and  Bundy,  the  latter  having  previously  won  from 
Dr.  Sumner  Hardy  and  Jack  Duncan  in  a  hard-fought,  three-set  rnatch. 
The  playing  was  most  sensational,  especially  on  the  part  of  Bell  and 
Bundy,  but  as  most  often  happens,  the  steadier  game  proved  the  best  and 
Long  and  Gardner  came  out  on  top  of  a  6/0,  3/6,  6/1,  6/2  score. 

The  challenge  match  of  the   singles  was  held  the  following  morning. 

McLoughlin  was  slow  in  starting,  while  Gardener  played  beautiful  tennis 
in  the  first  set  and  also  the  second,  where  he  led  at  5/2.  At  this  stage, 
things  began  to  change;  McLoughlin's  wrist,  which  was  slightly  strained, 
limbered  up  and  he  started  in  to  hammer  the  side  lines  for  aces,  both  back 
and  fore-hand.  Gardner  seemed  unable  to  prevent  this.  He  had  slackened 
his  pace  and  McLoughlin  was  the  aggressor  until  he  had  run  the  set  out 
f/5.  In  the  third  set  Gardner  made  a  brave  struggle  to  keep  the  lead, 
but  the  strain  of  the  day  before  was  telling  on  him  and  McLoughlin  ran 
out  the  set  6/3.  Gardner  gathered  strength,  however,  in  the  seven  minutes' 
rest  while  McLoughlin's  wrist  stiffened  again.  Gardner  took  this  set,  6/1, 
making  the   score    2   sets   all. 


78  SPALDINOS    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

In  the  deciding  set,  things  were  again  reversed,  McLoughlin  winning, 
6/2,  taking  the  championship  title  for  another  year. 

In  the  afternoon,  Long  and  Gardner  faced  Janes  and  McLoughlin,  the 
title-holders,  for  the  third  time  in  the  past  year  for  a  championship,  and 
for  the  third  time  went  down  to  defeat  after  winning  the  first  two  sets. 
This  match  was  a  trifle  more  careful  than  most  of  the  matches  between 
these  teams,  owing  mainly  to  the  bad  wrist  of  McLoughlin  on  one  side, 
and  the  poor  condition  of  Gardner  on  the  other. 

_  Miss  May  Sutton  played  a  magnificent  game  in  the  finals  of  the  women's 
singles  against  her  sister,  Florence.  These  two  wop  their  respective  places 
in  the  finals  with  little  trouble.  Against  May,  Florence  did  not  do  herself 
justice;  nevertheless,  she  should  have  done  better,  as  she  failed  to  take  a 
single  game  in   the   match. 

On  Monday,  July  5,  the  greatest  crowd  in  the  history  of  the  game  in 
California  gathered  to  see  the  match  between  Miss  Hotchkiss  and  Miss 
Sutton. 

Mi^  Hotchkiss  won  the  first  game  from  deuce  on  her  serve,  but  Miss 
Sutton  took  the  next.  At  4/4,  Miss  Sutton  took  two  straight  and  set. 
Miss  Hotchkiss  had  done  all  the  forcing  in  the  first  set  and  had  Miss 
Sutton  on  the  defensive  throughout,  but  she  lacked  the  steadiness  to  carry 
her    through,    falling    down    on    many    comparatively    easy    kills. 

From  the  start  of  the  second  set,  it  was  evident  that  a  change  had 
come  over  the  players.  Miss  Sutton  started  in  with  her  well-known 
aggressive  style,  putting  more  steam  in  her  drives  and  going  to  the  net 
oftener.  At  5/0  it  looked  as  if  Miss  Sutton  would  make  it  a  love  set,  but 
Miss  Hotchkiss  got  the  sixth  game  and  all  but  pulled  out  the  next  from  a 
lead  of  40/0  against  her.     The  summaries:

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL,  79 

Colorado  State  Championship. 

On  August  23  play  began  at  the  Denver  Country  Club  for  the  cham- 
pionship of   Colorado. 

The  tournament  was  won  by  A.  B.  Bowen  of  Denver,  who  defeated 
R.  D.  ^rooks  in  the  final  round.  Bowen,  by  winning  the  tournament, 
was  entitled  to  challenge  the  State  champion,  Donald  Harker,  which 
match  was  played  on  Saturday,  August  28,  and  resulted  in  a  victory  for 
the  champion,  who,  therefore,  gets  his  name  for  the  second  time  on  the 
Walsh  cup.  Should  he  win  it  next  year,  it  will  become  his  permanent 
property. 

In  the  doubles,  last  year's  champions,  the  Graham  brothers,  did  not 
defend  their  title,  and,  therefore,  J.  W.  Graham  and  J.  W.  Morey,  who 
defeated  Townsend  and  Shaf roth  in  the  linals,  became  the  holders  for   1909. 

The  tournament  was  the  largest  ever  held,  with  49  entries  in  the  singles 
and  19  teams  in  the  doubles.  The  entries  included  many  out-of-town 
players,  and  a  great  deal  of  interest  was  taken  throughout.  Weather  con- 
ditions were  very  favorable,  indeed,  and  the  entire  tournament  was  fin- 
ished up  within  the  week  specified. 


Connecticut  State  Championship. 


Dr.  P.  B.  Hawk,  for  the  third  successive  year  retained  the  title  of  Con- 
necticut State  Champion  when  he  defeated,  in  the  challenge  round,  F.  W. 
Cole,   of  Hartford,   in   a  very  close  five   set  match. 

The  tournament  which  began  on  July  12,  was  held  at  the  Litchfield 
Club,    Litchfield,   Conn. 

Surprise  was  occasioned  by  Cole's  defeat  in  four  sets,  of  L.  Perry  in 
the  final,  but  his  margin  of  winning  was  not  a  wide  one.  All  four  sets 
were  won  by  6/4  scores,  and  it  was  only  Cole's  greater  steadiness  at 
critical  times  that  gave  him  the  win.  In  his  match  against  Hawk  the  fifth 
set   touched  six  all  before  the  latter  managed   to  pull  it  out. 

The  combination  of  Cole  and  Perry  in  dovibles  proved  too  strong  a  one 
for  the  teams   they   encountered.     The  summaries :

Delaware  State  Championship. 


The  Rev.  H.  J.  Randall,  though  he  gave  a  good  account  of  himself,  was 
not  quite  fast  enough  to  take  W.  F.  Johnson's  title  from  him  in  the  chal- 
lenge round  of  the  Delaware  State  Championship,  which  began  July  10, 
at  the  Wilmington  Country  Club.  It  was  the  fourth  year  this  tourna- 
ment had  been  held,  and  though  small,  the  entry  list  contained  the  names 
of  several   players   of   national   reputation. 

A.  D.  Thayer  created  the  surprise  of  the  tournament  when  he  beat 
P.  B.  Hawk  in  the  first  round,  in  a  very  close  match,  and  J.  F.  Carpenter, 
Jr.,  in  the  semi-final.  Rendall's  first  hard  match  was  with  W.  M.  Tilden, 
whom  he  just  nosed  out,  but  Thayer  gave  him  a  hard  fight  in  the  final. 
Rendall's  vietory,  won  in  straight  sets,  was  not  an  easy  one,  and  there  was 
not  a  great  dift'erence  in  the  point  score.  When  Johnson  and  Rendall 
met,  the  title  holder  started  badly.  Winning  the  first  set,  he  dropped  the 
second  and  was  within  a  point  of  losing  the  third,  but  he  steadied 
quickly  and  soon  had  his  famous  chops  sliding  by  Rendall  for  ace  after 
ace,  till   the  match  ended  in  his  favor,   3   sets  to    i. 

H.  I\L  Tilden  and  A.  D.  Thayer  challenged  H.  J.  Rendall  and  J.  R. 
Carpenter  in  the  doubles,  and  after  four  fast  splendidly  played  sets  the 
'title  changed  hands.  Tilden  was  the  star  in  that  match,  smashing  and 
volleying  in  great  shape  and  Thayer  though  not  so  aggressive,  had  re- 
markable control.     The  summaries  :

Georgia  State  Championship. 


The  championship  of  Georgia  began  on  July  12,  at  the  Log  Cabin  Club, 
of  Macon.  W.  H.  Mansfield  and  E.  C.  Carter,  Jr.,  both  from  Atlanta, 
met  in  the  final  of  the  singles.  Carter  won  after  a  fast,  fairly  close 
match.  In  the  challenge  round,  E.  Taylor,  Jr.,  of  Macon,  made  a  hard 
fight  to  retain  his  title,  but  Carter  won  in  four  sets,  6/3,  2/6,   7/5,  6/3. 

Mansfield  and  Carter,  Jr.,  defeated  H.  C.  Bridgers  of  Tarboro,  N.  C, 
and  Taylor,  Jr.,  in  the  doubles  final  rather  easily. 


Illinois  State  Championship. 


Played  at  the  Aztec  Tennis  Club,  Chicago,  July  10-19,  the  Illinois  State 
Championship  proved  a  sifting  out  process  that  brought  W.  T.  Hayes  to 
the  final  round,  in  which  he  defeated  Carr,  his  rival,  6/0,  6/4.  In  the 
challenge  match  Hayes  won  from  C.  S.  Peters  in  straight  sets,  6/2,  6/2, 
6/2.  Fred  Carr  was  picked  by  many  to  win  the  tournament.  Two  years 
before,  while  a  player  at  the  University  of  Chicago,  Carr  was  considered 
one  of  the  leading  factors  in  Western  tennis.  Among  those  whom  he  de- 
feated in  this  tourney  were  J.  C.  Neely  and  Heath  Byford,  the  latter  a 
former  college  team  mate.  Peters  had  not  intended  to  defend  his  Illinois 
title,  bvit  having  been  nominated  in  the  doubles  with  Hayes,  appeared  for 
play.  The  doubles  honors  went  to  H.  Waidner  and  Neely,  who  defeated 
Hayes  and  Peters,  4/6,  6/0,  6/3,  4/6,  9/7.  Peters  ascribed  his  poor  show- 
ing against  Hayes  to  his  lack  of  practice  on  turf  courts.  His  matches, 
throughout  the  season,  had  been  on  clay,  and  the  change  was  too  great 
for  him  to  play  in  his   best  form. 

Miss  Miriam  Steever,  of  the  Kenwood  Country  Club,  after  three  years 
of  striving,  won  the  women's  title  from  Miss  Carrie  B.  Neely.  Miss 
Steever.  had  won  the  tournament  for  three  years  only  to  be  beaten  by  Miss 
Neely  in  the  challenge  roimd.  The  loser  was  first  to  congratulate  Miss 
Steever   and   complimented   her   for   her   improved    rame.      The   scores    were 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  83 

6/8,  6/i,  6/4.  Miss  Neely's  victory  in  the  initial  set  fatigued  her  greatly, 
and  thereafter  she  was  not  equal  to  the  clever  play  of  her  rival.  The 
women's  doubles  went  to  Miss  Steever  and  her  partner,  Miss  Edith  Hoyt, 
6/0,  6/3,  who  defeaded  Miss  Louise  Phillips  and  Mrs.  Hayden  Smith,  6/0, 
6/3.  Some  balm  was  accorded  Miss  Neely,  however,  for  with  her  brother, 
John  Neely,  as  her  partner,  she  took  the  mixed  doubles,  defeating  Mrs. 
Edgar  Barnes  and  N.   G.   Naylor.     The  summaries:

Idaho  State  Championship. 

H.  S.  Grey  won  the  championship  of  Idaho  on  June  4.  The  tourna- 
ment was  played  on  the  Lewiston  State  Normal  School's  courts.  In  the 
second  round  he  was  nearly  beaten  by  H.  A.^tel  of  Chicago.  Axtel  led 
at  one  time  by  one  set  and  5/1  and  40/0,  but  after  weathering  that  storm 
Grey  had  little  trouole.  His  opponent  in  the  final  round  was  M.  Wright 
whom  he  beat  7/5,  3/6,  7/5,  6/1.  In  the  doubles  Gray  and  Crapo  won  the 
championship  by  defeating  Wright  and  Summerville  at  6/4,  6/4,   5/7,  6/2. 


Indiana  State  Championship. 

R.  A.  Holden,  Jr.,  won  another  important  Western  event  when  he  came 
through  the  Indiana  State  Championship,  which  began  August  21  on  the 
Indianapolis   Tennis   Association's   courts. 

The  tournament  attracted  many  players  from  distant  places,  among 
them  being  C.  Rodgers  of  Nashville,  Tenn.,  and  C.  DeMotte  of  Philadel- 
phia. Holden,  at  the  height  of  his  game  that  week,  won  the  tournament 
without  the  loss  of  a  set  or  even  having  a  set  forced  to  deuce.  Smithers, 
his  opponent  in  the  final  round,  was  beaten  6/3,  6/3,  6/1.  In  the  chal- 
lenge round  the  holder,  S.  H.  Farber,  was  trounced  to  the  tune  of  6/0, 
6/1,  6/1.  Farber,  it  must  be  admitted,  was  sadly  in  need  of  practice,  and 
that  fact  considered,  he  was  not  expected  to  win  from  Holden.  The  latter, 
however,  played  a  remarkable  game,  and  that,  not  Farber's  poor  play,  was 
the  cause  of  such  a  one-sided  aff'air. 

In  the  doubles  Holden  and  Smithers  came  through  and  won  in  the  final 
from  Trask  and  Orme  in  straight  sets.     The  summaries :

International  and  WaihinglDn  State  Championships. 

On  August  9,  the  International  and  Washington  State  Championships 
began  at  Seattle.  The  two  separate  events  are  played  at  the  same  time, 
on  the  same  courts.  Practically,  all  the  cracks  in  the  Pacific  Northwest 
and  British  Columbia  entered.  Miss  Hotchkiss  and  R.  Gorrill  from  Cali- 
fornia also  competed. 

In  the  International  event,  B.  P.  Schwengers  of  Victoria,  came  through 
the  singles.  His  worthiest  foe,  J.  C.  Tyler,'  from  Spokane,  was  on  the 
same  side  of  the  draw,  and  they  met  in  the  semi-final  round.  Tvler  was 
very  erratic  and  the  Victorian's  steady  play  was  too  much  for  him. 
Schwengers  won  at  6/3,  1/6,  6/2.  In  the  final  round  Schwengers  defeated 
S.  Russell  of  Seattle.  The  latter  was  no  match  for  the  winner's  steadiness 
and  generalship,  and  although  the  score  6/'.  6/4,  6/4,  was  close,  Russell 
was  never  dangerous. 

The  final  in  the  doubles  was  a  hotly  contested  four-set  match  between 
Russell  and  Fitz  and  W.  Goss  and  B.  Wickersham  of  Portland.  The 
former  pair  won,   10/8,   6/4,    11/13,  6/0. 

In  the  State  event,  Tyler  came  tnrough  without  losing  a  set.  He  beat 
Russell,  6/4,  6/0,  in  the  semi-final  round,  and  the  Californian,  Gorrill,  did 
little  better  in  the  final.     Tyier  beat  him  7/5,  6/0,  6/4. 

Gorrill  and  Breeze  disposed  of  Fitz  and  Russell  in  a  long  match  in  the 
final  of  the  doubles.     The  score  was  6/4,  2/6,  7/5,  2/6,  6/4. 

Miss  Hotchkiss  won  every  event  in  which  she  took  part.  She  com- 
pletely outclassed  her  opponent  in  the  singles,  and  Miss  M.  Ryan  and  she 
were  never  extended  in  the  doubles.     Playmg  with  R.  Gorrill,  Miss  Hotch-

Maryland  State  Championship. 

One  of  the  oldest  cups  in  competition  was  won  outright  when  Robert 
LeRoy,  of  New  York,  successfully  defended  his  title  of  Maryland  State 
Champion  against  F.  C.  Colston,  of  Baltimore  The  tournament  which 
began  on  September  6  and  ended  the  following  Saturday,  was  played  on 
the  grass   courts  of  the   Baltimore   Country   Club. 

The  entry  list  was  small,  but  Colston,  G.  F.  Touchard  and  B.  Wagner, 
made  up  in  quality  what  it  lacked  in  numbers. 

Neither  Colston  nor  Touchard,  who  met  in  the  final  round,  had  mmh 
trouble  in  coming  through.  The  New  Yorker's  hardest  match  was  wivh 
Wagner,    who   won    the   second    set,    and    Colston's    chief   difficulty    was   his 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  91 

younger  brother,    J.    A.    C.    Colston.     The    latter   lost   the   opening   set   6/i, 
but  carried  the  games  to  seven-all  in  the   second. 

The  final  round  was  disappointing.  Colston  started  well,  winning  the 
opening  set  6/2  and  the  second  6/4,  but  Touchard  captured  the  third 
rather  easily.  The  fourth  and  last  set  was  the  best.  From  2I1,  Touchard 
ran  out  three  successive  games,  but  repeated  errors  aided  by  clever  net 
work  of  Colston's,  brought  the  score  to  five  all.  From  there  it  see-sawed 
to  six  all.  At  7/6  and  40/30,  Touchard  made  an  absurd  attempt  to  smash, 
and  when  again  within  a  point  of  the  set,  missed  a  volley  in  ridiculous 
manner.  Thereafter  Colston  forged  ahead  again  and  by  clever  placing  ran 
out  the  set  9/7. 

The  challenge  round  was  hard  fought  from  start  to  finish.  LeRoy  did 
not  get'  going  quickly,  and  the  Baltimorean  carried  ofif  the  first  set  6/4. 
For  the  remainder  of  the  match  it  was  a  battle  of  wits.  Both  men  pre- 
ferred the  back  court  ;  Colston  because  going  to  the  net  meant  being 
promptly  passed,  and  LeRoy  because  he  was  woefully  weak  at  volleying.- 
If  was  a  very  even  fight,  but  LeRoy  outmanoeuvere^  his  opponent  and  at 
critical  times  was  a  bit  steadier.  He  repeatedly  drew  Colston  up  by  clever 
placing  and  short  drops,  and  then  drove  by  him  for  aces  almost  at  will. 
All  fovir  sets  were  won  at  6/4. 

The  doubles  event  was  disappointing,  inasmuch  as  F.  C.  Colston  and 
Touchard  defaulted  to  LeRoy,  and  F.  Lowndes  in  the  final  round.  In  the 
first  round  Wagner  and  Fisher  came  within  a  point  of  defeating  the  tour- 
nament winners,  but  with  that  exception,  it  was  plain  sailing  for  both 
teams.     The  summaries :

Maryland  (Closed)  Championship. 

The  commencement  of  the  tournament  for  the  State  Championship,  open 
for  residents  of  Maryland,  was  postponed  from  June  4  to  17,  on  account 
of  rainy  weather.  The  event  was  held  at  the  Caionsville  Country  Club, 
near  Baltimore.  F.  C.  Colston  entered  and  won  all  his  matches  in  straight 
sets.  He  outclassed  his  opponents  one  and  all.  In  the  final  round  Colston 
and  C.  G.  Brooke  met  and  the  result  was  an  absurdly  easy  victory  for 
Colston.  Brooke  started  by  winning  the  lirst  game.  A  minute  or  so  later 
he  .again  led  by  winning  the  third,  but  those  two  games  were  all  he  won  in 
the  entire  match.  Colston  played  remarkably  line  tennis.  In  the  last 
game  of  the  match  he  returned  Brooke's  service  for  four  successive  aces, 
not  one  of  which  Brooke  was  able  to  touch.  The  doubles  was  by  no  means 
so  one  sided,  though  here  again,  Colston  was  victorious.  He  played  with 
B.  Wagner.  In  the  final  round  they  met  J.  A.  C.  Colston  and  A.  S.  Bowie. 
The  latter  pair  started  well,  winning  the  first  three  games,  but  Colston  and 
Wagner  ultimately  won  the  set  at  6/4.  They  captured  the  second  by  a 
similar  score,  but  v/ere  never  headed  as  in  the  first  set.     The  summaries :

94  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Massachusetts  State  Championship. 

Apparently  R.  C.  Seaver  has  as  strong  a  hold  on  the  Massachusetts  title 
as  ever,  for  on  June  5  he  smothered  his  challenger,  F.  J.  Sulloway,  in 
straight  sets.  It  was  the  fifth  consecutive  time  that  the  championship 
has   been  won   by  Seaver. 

The  usual  large  entry  competed,  and  despite  the  early  date,  the  Long- 
wood   courts   were   in   excellent   condition. 

The  surprise  of  the  week  was  N.  W.  Niles'  defeat  in  the  second  round 
by  G.  T.  Putman.  Putman  played  better  than  he  knew  how,  while  Niles 
seemed  in  need  of  practice.  The  latter  played  hard,  but  after  needing 
only  two  points  for  the  match  faded  completely  and  Putman  by  forcing- 
Niles  to  cover  much  ground,  had  little  difficulty  in  the  last  three  games. 
With  Niles,  who  was  chosen  as  Seaver's  challenger,  out  of  it,  it  was 
hard   to   predict   a  winner. 

Putman  was  away  ofif  when  he  met  Sulloway  in  the  next  round,  and 
was  beaten  in  two  easy  sets.  In  the  semi-finals  Sulloway  trimmed  A.  S. 
Dabney,  Jr.,  6/3,  6/1,  and  C.  F.  Johnson  had  a  close  match  with  R.  J, 
Leonard.     In  the  third  set  Leonard  blew  up  and  Johnson  won  at  6/1. 

Unfortunately,  Johnson  severely  wrenched  his  ankle  shortly  after  com- 
mencing his  match  withSllloway  and  retired  with  the  score  in  his  favor  at 
4i  3. 

Only  in  the  first  set  was  Sulloway  able  to  force  Seaver  in  the  challenge 
round,  but  the  latter  shook  him  otf  when  the  gamas  had  reached  seven  all. 
Sulloway  was  very  erratic  and  failed  to  score  a  game  in  the  second  set. 
In  the  third  he  led  ar  zfz,  but  Seaver  caught  up  and  passed  him,  winning 
four  of  the  last  five  games.  It  was  a  back  court  game  from  start  to  fin- 
ish, but  Seaver's  greater  endurance,  court  covering  ability  and  reach  were 
too  great  a  handicap  for  Sulloway.     The  summaries :

of  Massachusetts  tennis  champions  in  doubles  against  the  assault  of  the

was  played  at  the  Brae  liurn  Country  Club,  Newton,  Mass.,  May  29  to 
June  7.  Before  the  match,  that  this  would  be  the  outcome  was  a  foregone 
conclusion  in  the  opinion  of  many  tennis  followers,  but  how  nearly  the 
opposite  resulted  only  the  contestants  and  the  hundred-odd  spectators 
know.  The  match  was  a  battle  royal  from  the  time  that  C.  F.  Johnson 
served  the  first  ball  till  Wright  smashed  the  last  one  out  of  H.  C.  John- 
son's reach  for  the  winning  point',  two  hours  and  a  half  later.  It  was  one 
of  the  best-played,  fastest  and  closest  matches  ever  played  in  a  State  tour- 
nament.    The  summary  :

Michigan  State  Championship. 


The  biggest  tennis  event  of  the  year  in  Detroit  was  the  Michigan  State 
tournament,  played  the  first  week  in  August.  There  were  over  thirty 
entries  in  the  singles,  and  the  competition  was  excellent.  More  towns 
were  represented  than  ever  before,  players  being  entered  from  Detroit, 
Toledo,  Saginaw,  Alpena,  Caro,  Holly,  Ypsilanti  and  Hillsdale.  Harry 
Stevens  of  Detroit,  as  in  1908,  was  the  winner  of  the  tournament,  and 
failed  for  the  second  time  to  defeat  Champion  N.  H.  Bundy  of  Grand 
Rapids,  who  by  this  third  consecutive  victory  won  permanent  possession  of 
the  challenge  cup.  Stevens  showed  superiority  over  all  his  opponents  in 
the  tournament  proper,  but  Bundy  was  too  much  for  him.  The  Detroit- 
er's  steady  placing  game  was  met  by  the  Grand  Rapids  expert's  slashing 
drives,  which  were  practically  unplayable.  In  the  opinion  of  many,  Bundy's 
game  was  not  as  good  as  the  year  before,  but  it  was  good  enough  to  win. 
Stevens  took  the  first  set,  but  Bundy  then  took  three  straight.  The  scores 
were,  3/6,  7/5,  6/2,  6/2. 

A  notable  figure  in  the  singles  play  was  Walter  McNeil,  former  state 
champion,  who  was  i;unner-up  to  Stevens.  He  played  a  lot  of  good  tennis, 
but  met   Stevens    the    same    day    he  had   beaten    Cone    of   Toledo    in    a  ,hot

match,  and  couldn't  keep  up  his  gait.  Cone  was  something  of  a  surprise, 
playing  some  very  consistent  tennis  and  putting  two  of  the  Detroit  cracks, 
Hibbard  and  Atkinson,  out  of  the  running.  George  Shaw  of  Toledo 
smothered  everybody  he  met  until  he  went  up  against  Stevens,  and,  as  he 
found  the  latter   in   top   form,   met   his  Waterloo. 

The  Shaw  brothers  won  the  doubles,  which  were  rather  a  disappointment 
from  lack  of  entries  and  defaults.  The  Toledo  contingent  cleaned  up  on. 
all  other  entrants,  putting  two  teams  into  the  final  match.  Cone  and 
Leidy  were  the  Shaws'  opponents  and  almost  beat  them  out.  The  score,. 
0/6,  2/6,  6/3,  6/2,  6/4.  The  presence  of  this  Toledo  party,  seven  in  num- 
ber, added  in  no  small  degree  to  the  class  and  enjoyment  of  the  tourna- 
ment. The  affair  was  well  handled,  Chairman  Ross  H.  Holmes,  Jr.,  push- 
ing things  with  his  usual  vigor  and  close  attention  to  detail.  The  umpiring 
was  better  than  ordinary,  and  the  footfault  rule  was  pretty  well  enforced, 
though  there  were  some  infractions  that  went  unpunished. 


Minnesota  State  Championship. 


Played  on  the  courts  of  the  Minikahd^  Club,  near  Minneapolis,  August 
28  to  September  6,  the  Minnesota  State  Championship  was  brought  to  a 
successful  conclusion  despite  rain  that  made  play  impossible  on  one  day. 
Joseph  Armstrong,  the  little  St.  Paul  expert,  won  the  final  round,  defeating; 
J.  H.  Wheeler  in  a  hard  fought  four-set  match,  6/4,  6/4,  5/7,  7/5.  While 
the  defeated  St.  Paul  man  put  up  a  fine  order  of  tennis,  his  rival  was- 
faster  on  his  feet,  surer  on  returns   and  at  smashing.      The   summaries :

Montana  Championship. 

On  August  17,  the  fourteenth  annual  championship  of  Montana  was  be- 
gun at  Helena. 

D.  D.  McLaughlin,  a  man  of  fifty-eight  years,  successfully  defended  his 
title  against  H.  Burton,  of  Butte,  but  the  match  went  the  limit  of  five  sets. 
McLaughlin's  stamina  and  agility  were  remarkable  and  his  knowledge  of 
the  game  excellent.  He  had  a  narrow  escape,  but  ultimately  won  at  8/6, 
2/6,  9/7,  3/6,  6/3.  At  the  expiration  of  play  he  was  less  fatigued  than  his. 
youthful   opponent. 

The  doubles  went  tp  Matteson  and  Agar,  of  Great  Falls,  after  a  clo»' 
tussel   with   Burton   and    Mosher. 


98  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

New  Jersey  State  Championship. 

R.  H.  Palmer  was  again  successful  in  his  match  with  Neal  Stevens, 
which  envolved  the  title  of  New  Jersey  State  Champion.  Last  year  these 
two  met  in  the  final  round  and  holder  E.  P.  Larned's  default,  gave  Palmer 
the  title.  A  small  entry  list  was  amended  by  the  rank  of  several  of  the 
contestants,  which  included  ex-champion  F.  G.  Anderson,  F.  C.  Inman,  N. 
Stevens,  W.   C.  Grant,  and  C.   F.  Watson,  Jr. 

The  first  surprise  came  when  Stevens  beat  Grant  in  two  easy  sets.  The 
latter  played  listlessly  and  made  little  effort  to  get  in  and  win.  Later  on 
Anderson  fell  before  Hinck  in  a  match  which  showed  plainly  the  loss  of 
his  once  well  known  ability.  Steadiness,  one  of  his  strong  points,  was 
entirely  lacking,  and  from  a  lead  of  4/1  he  allowed  Hinck  to  run  out  five 
consecutive  games. 

In  the  semi-final  round  Hinck  disposed  of  Watson  in  two  sets,  and 
Stevens  duplicated  the  performance  with  R.  P.  Bennett.  Bennett  was  no 
match  for  the  Yale  man,  but  Watson  forced  Hinck  to  show  his  best. 
The  latter  was  right  on  edge,  but  Watson  lacked  the  aggressiveness  neces- 
sary to  win.  The  Hinck-Stevens  battle  in  the  final  round  was  a  hot  one. 
None  of  the  sets  were  close,  and  'the  feature  of  the  play  was  the  easy  way 
in  which  all  live  were  won.  First  Hinck  outclassed  Stevens,  then  vice- 
versa,  but  in  the  fifth  set,  with  the  score  three  all,  Stevens  made  an  ener- 
getic net  attack  which  carried  him  through  by  a  safe  margin. 

Stevens  and  Palmer  had  a  inuch  closer  match  in  the  challenge  round 
than  was  predicted,  but  in  the  end  Palmer  won  by  a  sudden  spurt,  which 
Stevens,  who  was  thoroughly  fatigued,  was  unable  to  cope  with.  It  was 
pretty  tennis.  Stevens  handled  Palmer's  hard  drives  with  the  utmost  ease, 
but  there  were  whole  games  in  which  the  Jersey  player  drove  past  his 
opponent  for  clean  aces. 

The  draw  was  very  uneven  in  the  doubles,  with  the  result  that  the  win- 
ners. Palmer  and  H.  C.  Martin,  had  a  very  easy  time  in  the  final  round. 
Their  opponents,  G.  C.  Thomas  and  S.  Raleigh,  although  winning  the 
third  set,  were  really  outclassed.  The  match  which  practically  decided  the 
event  was  played  between  Palmer  and  Martin  and  Grant  and  Hinck.  It 
was  anybody's  until  the  last  point  was  won,  but  Grant  weakened  in  the 
last  two  games  and  thereby  lost  what  chance  he  and  Hinck  had. 

Miss  M.  Wagner  defended  against  Mrs..  W.  H.  Pouch  in  the  challenge 
round  of  the  women's  Singles,  winning  in  straight  sets,  and  Miss  Wagner 
with  Miss  E.  C.  Bunce  defeated  Mrs.  Pouch  and  Miss  E.  Wildey  in  the 
final  round  in   doubles.      The  summaries :

New  York  State  Championship. 

A  new  event  in  turf  court  tournaments  was  created  when  the  New  York 
State  Championship  was  played  on  the  splendid  stretch  of  grass  of  tlie 
Crescent  Athletic  Club  at  Bay  Ridge,  N.  Y.  Play  commenced  on  Satur- 
day, July   31. 

A  high  class  entry  list  was  enhanced  by  the  appearance  of  the  Cal'for- 
nians,  M.  H.  Long,  T.  C.  Bundy  and  S.  Sinsabaugh,  and  Mexi'.c  was  rep- 
resented in  the  person  of  H.  M.  McOuiston.  R.  D.  Little,  R  LeRo.v,  K. 
H.  Behr,  R.  H.  Palmer  and  G.  F.  Touchard  M'ere  the  Eastern  cracks  who 
made  the  event  an  important  one,  and  added  interest  was  caused  by  the 
entry  of  veteran  E.  P.  Fischer.  The  Dotibles  contained  the  names  of  F.  B. 
Alexander  and  H.  H.  Hackett,  K.  H.  Behr  and  R.  D.  Little,  and  W.  A. 
Larned   and   R.    D.    Wrenn. 

In  the  second  round  Little  and  Bundy  played  the  featured  match,  and 
though  the  New  Yorker  won,  Bundy  captured  the  middle  set.  His 
puzzling  delivery  and  excellent  volleying  annoyed  Little  considerably  for 
a  time,  but  the  latter  overwhelmed  the  visitor  in  the  deciding  set  with 
beautifully  placed  drives  and  heavy  smashes.  Behr  had  a  narrow  escape 
at  the  hands  of  G.  A.  L.  Dionne,  two  long  deuce  sets  being  necessary  be- 
fore he  won.  McOuiston  triumphed  over  Fischer  in  three  sets.  The  latter 
started  with  a  rush  but  was  unequal  to  the  physical  strain,  tiring  rapidly- 
after  the  first  set. 

A  round  later  Lon^  smothered  C.  M.  Bull,  Jr.,  in  short  order  and 
Palmer  proved  too  fast  for  the  Kings  County      crack,.  H.  J.  Mollenhauer.

The  first  upset  occurred  when  Palmer  was  beaten  by  C.  C.  Pell  after 
having  been  within  a  point  of  victory.  Pell  played  fast,  heady  tennis, 
while  Palmer  at  critical  times  was  quite  unsteady.  Behr  in  this  round 
overpowered  McQuiston  without  great  difhculty,  but  was  ovitplayed  in  two 
fast  sets  by  Long  in  the  next.  It  was  not  good  tennis  at  any  stage,  and 
Behr's  errors  reached  an  appalling  total.  LeRoy  made  amends  for  his  de- 
feat at  Longwood  by  Inman  oy  winning  from  the  latter  in  two  short  sets. 
Inman  was  very  erratic  and  really  caused  his  own  downfall  by  an  unending 
series  of  outs  and  nets. 

Pell  had  his  hands  full  in  disposing  of  C.  Cragin,  finally  winning  at  7/5 
and  9/7.  Little  dropped  a  love  set  to  Touchard.  The  internationalist 
played  carelessly  but  outclassed  his  younger  rival  in  the  deciding  set. 

Straight  sets  was  the  order  of  the  semi-final  round.  LeRoy  proved  too 
heady  a  player  for  Pell,  and  at  critical  times  was  much  faster  and  accurate. 
He  passed  Pell  at  will  but  was  noticeably  weak  at  both  volleying  and  over- 
head play.  The  other  match  was  disappointing.  Little,  at  the  very  height 
of  his  game,  outplayed  Long  from  start  to  finish  and  won  bj'  a  wide  mar- 
gin. Long  seemed  nervous  and  was  sadly  wanting  in  decisive  action.  Lit- 
tle played  constantly  to  his  rival's  far  corners,  and  the  Californian  lacked 
the  opportunity  to  test  his  strength  at  the  net  on  which  he  largely  de- 
pends. A  series  of  sharp  fast  passes  by  Little  frightened  Long  from  his 
stronghold  and  he  was  clearly  outclassed  in  groimd  strokes. 

The  final  round,  played  on  the  following  Saturday,  was  interesting, 
though  not  particularly  good  tennis.  Both  LeRoy  and  Little  were  at  times 
brilliant  in  the  extreme  and  again  descended  to  the  depths  of  mediocrity. 
Little  had  the  better  all  round  game,  however,  and  it  was  LeRoy's  decided 
weakness  at  the  net  that  prevented  a  closer  contest.  He  outdrove  his 
older  rival  time  and  again,  but  Little,  at  the  net,  was  invincible.  It  was  a 
match  in  which  generalship  was  the  principal  factor  and  LeRoy  was  out- 
witted four  in  five  times.  Nothing  of  much  importance  occurred  in  the 
Doubles  until  the  fourth  round,  when  Alexander  and  Hackett  had  the  nar- 
rowest escape  from  defeat  since  they  became  champions.  The  distinction 
so  nearly  earned  was  attempted  by  Larned  and  Wrenn.  It  was  a  peculiarly 
uneven  contest.  In  the  first  set  Larned  and  Wrenn  were  too  fast  for  the 
title  holders,  winning  6/3,  but  they  were  repaid  with  a  love  set  in  rettn-n. 
The  final  set  was  bitterly  fought,  and  both  teams  had  a  victory  almost  in 
reach  repeatedly.  Alexander,  who  was  in  much  need  of  practice,  was  very 
erratic  and  Larned  alternated  brilliant  shots  with  absurd  errors.  It  was 
not  until  7-all  was  announced  that  Alexander  and  Hackett,  by  playing  at 
Wrenn's  feet  and  throwing  caution  to  the  winds,  managed  to  hammer  out 
the   remainder   of   the   match. 

Little  and  Behr  just  escaped  a  beating  at  the  hands  of  Long  and  Mc- 
Quiston. The  Western  combination  led  two  sets  to  one  when  darkness 
ended  play.  The  following  day  the  New  Yorkers  were  much  improved, 
while  their  rivals  seemed  sufTfering  from  a  reaction,  and  the  balance  of  the 
match  was   not   very   closely   contested. 

Not  even  the  phlegmatic  Hacket  was  exempt  from  the  unsteadiness 
which  marked  the  play  of  all  four  finalists.  Behr  was  painfully  uncertain, 
but  Little  for  the  most  part  played  sterling  tennis.  Both  teams  had  re- 
peated opportunities  to  win  the  first  set  before  the  champions  took  it  9/7. 
The  second  produced  better  tennis,  but  Little  and  Behr  won  only  half  the 
necessary  number  of  games.  The  third  set  saw  Little  playing  brilliantly 
and  a  decided  slump  on  the  part  of  his  opponents.  At  5/1  against  them 
the  latter  threw  away  the  seventh  game.  However,  they  again  pulled 
ahead  in  the  fourth  set,  and  Little  and  Behr  were  beaten  6/2.

Ohio  State  Championship. 


Playing  before  fhe  largest  throng  that  ever  watched  a  state  tourney  in 
Ohio,  Charles  N.  Beard  won  the  title  in  his  home  town,  Cleveland,  August 
6,  defeating  Fred  Carr,  of  Youngstown,  3/6,  2/6,  6/2,  9/7,  defaulted.  It 
was  a  battle  of  endurance,  Carr  defaulting  the  last  set  because  of  physical 
distress.  These  rivals  met  in  Chicago  in  the  Western  championship  in 
1903,  when  Beard  won  easily  by  reason  of  his  wonderful  physique  and  stay- 
ing abilities.  Carr  is  a  Kenyon  student  and  held  the  intercollegiate  cham- 
pionship title  of  Ohio.  The  default  of  Champion  E.  B.  Dewhurst,  and  non- 
appearance of  G.  L.  Wyeth,  ex-champion,  caused  general  disappointment, 
but  otherwise  the   event  was   a  big  success. 

The  doubles  was  won  by  H.  F.  Pettee  and  C.  O.  Benton,  who  defeated 
H.  Wick  and  P.  Collins  in  the  challenge  round.  W.  C.  Grant  and  T.  R.

Oklahoma  State  Championship. 


In  spite  of  two  postponements  and  the  late  date  of  holding,  the  second 
annual  tournament  for  the  State  championship  was  larger  and  more  inter- 
esting than  last  year's  event,  having  thirty-two  entries  in  singles  and  fif- 
teen teams  in  doubles.  That  the  tournament  was  so  surprisingly  success- 
ful was  due  to  the  great  efforts  of  the  Shawnee  Country  Club.  It  was 
held  October  11  and  following  days,  on  the  courts  of  that  club  at  Shaw- 
nee,   Okla. 

In  the  singles,  J.  T.  Bailey  of  Albion,  last  year's  champion,  showed  a 
much  improved  game,  and  won  the  championship  again  without  the  loss 
of  a  set.  His  opponent  in  the  challenge  round  was  R.  A.  Vose  of  Okla- 
homa City,  but  the  latter  was  outclassed,  and  Bailey  won  at  6/0,  6/1,  6/4. 
The  doubles  resulted  in  a  second  triumph  for  the  single  champion,  who, 
paired  with  C.  T.  Speice,  defeated  in  straight  sets  Vose  and  R.  E.  Conger.

Oregon  State  Championship. 

On  July  29  the  championship  of  Oregon  began  at  the  Multnomah  A.  A. 
of  Portland.  It'  was  the  eleventh  holding  of  this  event  and  a  representa- 
tive entry  was  drawn.  Though  Tyler,  Payne,  and  McBurney  were  not 
included,  Major  Bethel,  truly  a  veteran  of  the  game,  took  part  and  gave 
Wickersham  a  hard  time,  for  two  sets  in  the  final  round.  The  latter  has 
improved  very  much,  however,  and  played  far  better  than  Bethel,  after 
dividmg  the  tirst  two  sets  with  him.  The  title  was  decided  in  that  match 
for  W.  A.  ^IcBurney,  the  holder,  was  unable  to  appear.  Wickersham  and 
W.  Goss  did  not  have  great  difficulty  in  winning  the  doubles,  and  there 
again  the  title  went  by  default.  McBurney  and  Tyler  held  it  in  1908.  The

Pennsylvania  State  Championship. 

Through  the  default  of  E.  B.  Dewhurst,  W.  F.  Johnson  became  Pennsyl- 
vania State  Champion  when  he  came  through  the  tournament,  which  was 
played   at   the   Merion   Cricket    Club   of   Haverford,    Philadelphia. 

Craig  Biddle  put  up  an  unexpectedly  strong  game  against  Johnson  in 
the  first  round,  but  he  was  the  only  entrant  to  capture  a  set  from  the 
Intercollegiate  Champion.  W.  M.  Tilden  was  Johnson's  victim  in  the  semi- 
final round  and  H.  J.  Rendall's  aspirations  ended  when  he  encountered 
him  in  the  final.  Rendall  played  well  and  Johnson  had  to  extend  himself 
to  the  utmost  to  win  in  straight  sets,  all  of  which  were  close.  Rendall 
played  a  good,  three  .=et  match  with  ex-Champion  J.  R.  Carpenter,  Jr., 
just   before   meeting  Johnson. 

Dewhurst  and  Carpenter  were  just  a  bit  too  good  for  Johnson  and 
Rendall  in  the  doubles  challenge  match.  The  holder's  team  work  was 
better  and  their  attack  more  varied.  Nevertheless  the  match  was  close 
and   well    worth   seeing.      The   summaries :

Rhode  Island  State  Closed  Championship. 

The  closed  championship  of  Rhode  Island,  which  began  late  in  Sep- 
tember at  the  Agawam  Hunt  Club,  was  won  for  the  third  successive  year 
by  J.  E.  D.  Jones.  His  challenger  was  J.  O.  Ames,  but  Jones  won  with 
very  little  difficulty  in   straight   sets  at  6/3,   6/3,   6/1. 

Ames'  showing  was  disappointing,  in  view  of  his  defeats  of  E.  T.  Gross- 
at  6/4,  6/3,  and  H.  A.  McKinney  at  6/0,  6/4,  but  he  had  a  decidedly  off- 
day  when  he  encountered  the  champion. 

Gross  and  R.  N.  Dana  took  W.  W.  White,  Jr.,  and  McKinney  into- 
camp  after  the  challengers  had  won  the  third  set  at  61 1.     The  summaries :

South  Dakota  State  Championship. 

The  South  Dakota  State  championship  was  played  at  Mitchell,  July 
21-24.  J.  E.  Barton  of  Sioux  Falls,  S.  D.,  thrice  winner  of  the  title,  gained 
possession  of  the  'loving  cup  trophy  by  beating  R.  Branson,  also  of  Sioux 
Falls  in  the  finals,  4/6,  8/6,  6/4,  4/6,  8/6^  Barton  and  Phillips  defended 
their  title  in  doubles,  defeating  Branson  and  Wells  in  straight  sets,  all  at 
6/2.  The  consolation  doubles  finals  were  won  by  Hager  and  Blake,  who 
defeated   Rowley  and  Winsor,    6/2,   6/3,   6/2. 


Tennessee  State  Championship. 


Because  of  the  absence  of  Cowan  Rogers  and  E.  V.  Carter,  E.  Phelps 
had  a  rather  easy  time  in  the  Tennessee  State  championship,  which  began 
on  June  28,  at  the  Memphis  Tennis  Club.  The  semi-finals  and  final 
round  were  transferred  to  the  Memphis  Country  Club,  where  the  courts 
were  superior  and  the  spectators  could  be  better  accommodated.  Phelps 
and  Cornelius  met  in  the  final  round.  Cornelius  had  previously  defeated 
Phelps'  partner,  R.  B.  Logan,  and  a  good  match  was  expected.  How- 
ever, Phelps  had  one  of  his  rapidly  increasing  good  days,  and  the  effect 
was  disastrous  to  his  opponent.  Cornelius  won  two  games  in  the  first  set, 
but  Phelps  ran  seventeen  games  without  a  break.  It  was  very  one-sided, 
but  the  unusual  brilliancy  of  Phelps'  play  saved  it  from  being  an  unin- 
teresting match.  Logan  and  Phelps  outclassed  their  opponents  in  doubles 
until  they  faced  Hardy  and  Norton  in  the  windup.  The  latter  team  took 
the  first  set  and  the  remaining  three  were  all  close.     The  summaries :

Texas  State  Championship. 

C.  Butlin  successfully  defended  his  title  of  Texas  State  champion  when, 
•on  August  28,  he  won  in  four  sets  in  the  final  round  from  H.  M.  Mc- 
Quiston.  The  tournament,  which  began  August  23,  was  held  at  the 
Dallas   Lawn  Tennis   Club,   Dallas,   Texas. 

While  the  entry  was  small  it  was  not  lacking  in  class.  In  the  first 
round  Semp  Russ  met  T.  Holland,  both  former  champions,  and  Russ 
won.  The  first  set  was  easy,  but  Holland  by  clever  net  work,  forced  the 
game  score  to  ten  all  in  the  second.  In  the  same  round  C.  C.  Cresson, 
another  ex-champion,  fell  before  the  consistency  of  Payne's  attack,  but 
Cresson  failed  to  show  the  form  which  made  him  the  title  holder  several 
years  before.  L.  Walthal  gave  no  end  of  trouble  to  Champion  Butlin, 
Tjut  lacked  steadiness  and  fell  down  repeatedly  on  easy  shots. 

Russ  and  Butlin  came  together  in  the  semi-final  round,  but  the  affair 
■was  disappointing.  Russ.  always  prone  to  wildness,  played  into  Butlin  s 
hands  with  his  rather  high  drives.  The  latter  at  the  height  of  his  clever 
-net  game,  cut  them  off  as  fast  as  they  came  over  and  won  easily  in 
strain-ht   sets.      In   the    upper   half   McQuiston's    great    steadiness   won    him 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  113 

tiis  match  with  Walthal  after  four  close  sets.  Walthal  tried  too  often  for 
aces  and  these  attempts  were  largely  responsible  for  his  defeat. 

The  iinal  round  developed  a  very  pretty  contest.  It  was  a  case  of  But- 
lins'  volleying  against  MacOuiston's  driving,  and  in  the  end  the  former's 
style  won.  MacOuiston  won  the  first  set  and  needed  one  point  for  the 
third,  but  three  outs  spoiled  his  chances  and  Butlin  thereafter  was  never 
headed. 

Butlin  was  again  successful  when,  paired  with  Jenkins,  he  won  from 
MacQuiston  and  Patt'on  in  the  final  round.  The  match  was  not  in  any 
sense  close,  but  the  losers,  a  new  combination,  were  very  'ragged  in  team 
play.  Both  Jenkins  and  Butlin  have  had  much  experience  in  English  com- 
petition and  their  better  understanding  of  the  doubles  game  was  at  once 
noticeable. 


Utah  State  Championship. 


Samuel  Neel,  who  in  1896  held  the  national  doubles  championship  with 
his  brother,  Carr,  regained  his  title  of  Utah  State  Champion  when  he  came 
through  the  tournament  held  in  June  at  Salt  Lake  City.  In  1908,  Neel, 
because  of  an  injury  to  his  ankle,  defaulted  to  E.  M.  Garnett  in  the  chal- 
lenge round,  but  with  the  former  titleholder  once  more  fit,  Garnett's  laurels 
were  but  short  lived.  The  doubles  event  was  won  by  O.  J.  and  R.  W. 
Salisbury. 


Vermont  State  Championship. 


The  Old  Pine  Golf  Club,  of  St.  Johnsbury,  Vt.,  was,  as  usual,  the  scene 
of  the  State  championship.  The  tournament  which  began  the  second 
•week  in  August,  was  smaller  than  usual,  but  the  evenness  of  the  matches 
made  it  one  of  exceptional  interest. 

The  final  honors  went  to  F.  H.  Harris,  the  New  England  Intercolle- 
giate champion.  J.  H.  MacVeagh  of  Exeter  Academy  was  runner  up. 
MacVeagh  started  in  badly  and  suffered  from  nervousneis.  Harris  had 
won  two  sets  before  the  former  settled  down.  Then  MacVeagh  captured 
a  set  at  6/4.     The  fourth  and  last  set  went  to  Harris  by  a  like   score. 

In  the  challenge  match  it  was  apparent  that  G.  W.  Pike,  the  holder,  was 
far  from  his  best  form.  Hairis  played  well,  but  Pike's  lack  of  strength 
and  stamina  was  a  handicap  too  great  to  overcome.  C.  T.  Porter  and 
C.  H.  Collester  won  the  doubles  and  their  first  leg  on  the  challenge  cups, 
by  the  default  of  Pike  and  R.   Hooker.     The  summaries :

Virginia  State  Championship. 


F.  Geoghegan  was  outclassed  when  he  was  challenged  by  J.  H.  Winston 
in  the  Virgmia  State  Championship.  The  tournament  began  on  June  14, 
but  inclement  weather  deferred  the  termination  until  June  22. 

Winston  and  H.  G.  Whitehead  fought  it  out  in  the  finals,  and  a  great 
five-set  match  was  the  result  of  their  meeting.  Winston's  splendid  over- 
head work  and  volleying  was  responsible  for  his  victory,  for  Whitehead 
was  his  equal  in  everything  else.  In  the  doubles  Whitehead  reversed  the 
tables  on  Winston.  He  and  W.  Reed,  Jr.,  successfully  defended  against 
Winston  and  W.  H.  Taylor,  Jr.  It  was  nip  and  tuck  for  four  sets.  In 
the  fifth  the  score  reached  five  all  when  the  champions,  by  rushing  in. 
and  taking  big  chances,  banged  out  two  games  and  the  match. 

Mrs.  W.  Tidball  won  the  ladies'  singles  and  allowed  Miss  M.  C.  Evans, 
the  holder,  only  two  games  in  the  challenge  match.     The  summaries :

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  II5 

West  Virginia  State  Tournament. 

The  fourth  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  West  Virginia 
was  held  on  the  four  clay  courts  of  the  Parkersburg  Country  Club,  August 
23-26,    1909. 

The  courts  were  in  perfect  condition,  and  the  snappy  and  high  grade 
play  was  rewarded  by  splendid  galleries  of  enthusiastic  spectators. 

Deserving  of  special  mention  was  the  excellent  form  displayed  by 
Everett  Drennen  of  Fairmont,  W.  Va.,.  former  state  champion,  who  played 
through  the  upper  half,  meeting  with  several  hard  matches  on  the  way,  and 
R.  A.  Johnson  of  Parkersburg,  W.  Va.,  who  played  through  the  lower  half, 
but  was  more  fortunate  in  the  draw,  as  he  came  through  to  the  finals 
without  the  loss  of  a  set. 

Drennen,  by  winning  from  Johnson  in  the  final  round  by  a  score  of  2/6, 
■6/1,  6/4,  7/5,  earned  the  right  to  challenge  the  holder  of  the  three-year  cup. 
Ward  White.  This  match  was  a  most  exciting  contest  and  was  marked 
from  start  to  finish  with  the  cleverest  kind  of  play  and,  after  going  the 
limit  of  five  sets,  was  finally  won  by  Drennen  by  a  score  of  ild,  5/7,  6/3, 
■6/3,  7/5.     It  gave  him  his  second  leg  on  the  challenge  cup.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  117 

^nd  many  hard-fought  matches.  L.  J.  Washburne,  a  Chicagoan,  after  a 
period  of  strenuous  play,  emerged  from  the  singles  winner  of  the  final 
round,  having  beaten  E.  Morley,  the  former  University  of  Wisconsin  star, 
in  a  decisive  manner  at  6/4,  6/2,  3/6  and  6/1.  This  was  Washburne's  first 
big  match,  and  he  appeared  nervous  when  he  met  Richard  Crozier,  holder 
of  the  title,  in  the  challenge  round.  In  the  second  set,  however,  the  chal- 
lenger gave  the  champion  all  he  could  attend  to,  and  in  the  third  set 
Crozier  was  taken  in  tow  6I2.  But  Crozier  was  not  to  be  denied  and  for 
the  third  successive  time  showed  his  superiority  over  the  Badger  State 
players  by  taking  the  title. 

The  Helmholz  fjrothers,  Henry  and  Waldemar,  took  the  measure  of 
Crozier  and  Thornton  Green  in  one  of  the  fastest  doubles  matches  ever 
seen  in  Wisconsin,  and  their  reward  was  a  second  win  of  the  Spalding 
challenge   cups.     Their   first   victory  was   in    1907.

Palm  Beach  Tournament. 

The  first  annual  Winter  Championship  of  Florida  was  held  at  Palm

such  as  Beals  Wright,  Harold  Hackett,  C.  R.  Gardner,  Edgar  Leonard.

SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL,  119 

Though  the  tennis  was  essentially  midwinter  in  quality  at  the  start  of 
the  event,  it  improved  day  by  day,  and  the  final  rounds  b>rought  out  very 
clever  playing.  Beals  Wright  came  through  to  the  final  of  the  upper  half 
and  defeated  C.  R.  Gardner,  the  Californian,  for  the  title  in  a  good  four- 
set   match,    6/4,   6/4,    2/6,    6/3. 

In  the  semi-finals  Wright  beat  Dana,  ^Iz,  6/1,  and  Gardner  defeated 
Hackett,  5/7,  6/0,  6/4.  The  latter  match  was  hard  fought  and  close,  par- 
ticularly in  the  first  and  third  set's,  Gardner's  reach  standing  him  in  good 
stead. 

Leonard  won  in  the  second  round  from  ex-Champion  Slocum,  6/3,  1/6, 
6/3.  It  was  a  fair  match,  Slocum  being  beaten  by  a  faster  and  more 
brilliant  player,  whose  endurance  surpassed  his  own.  Leonard  then  lost 
to  Dana,  3/6,  2/6.  Dana  played  with  machine-like  correctness  and  scarcely 
erred  in  the  whole  two  sets,  while  Leonard  made  one  mis-play  after 
another. 

In  the  final  of  the  doubles  Wright  and  Hackett  won  from  Leonard  and 
Gardner,  9/7,  6/2,  4/6,  6/8,  6/3.  This  contest  proved  the  most  exciting 
of  the  entire  week  and  was  replete  with  sensational  rallies.  The  steadiness 
and  superior  team  work  of  Wright  and  Hackett  was  too  much  for  their 
opponents  in  the  end,  though  the  losers  tried  hard  right  up  to  the  last 
point.  Leonard  was  easily  the  star  of  the  match,  his  brilliant  and  graceful 
plays  bringing  him  much  applause.

Miscellaneous   Tournaments 

Southampton  Tournament. 

The  annual  invitation  tournament  of  the  Meadow  Club  of  Southampton,. 
Long  Island,  N.  Y.,  was  begun  on  the  morning  of  August  lo,  with  an. 
entry  list  of  sixty  players   in  singles  and  thirty  teams  in  doubles. 

The  draw  contained  the  names  of  most  of  the  prominent  men  playing 
around  the  East,  but  owing  to  a  decision  of  the  club  refusing  to  allow 
the  use  of  spiked  shoes,  W.  J.  Clothier  and  N.  W.  Niles  decided  to  with- 
draw. Clothier  having  sustained  Tan  injury  to  his  ankle.  With  the  former 
out  of  it  the  tournament  was  a  matter  for  much  speculation,  with  W.  F. 
Johnson,  R.  LeRoy,  R.  H.  Palmer  and  E.  P.  Earned  the  favored  ones. 
As  it  turned  out.  Earned  and  Johnson  met  in  the  hnal  round,  the  latter 
having  beaten  EeRoy  and  Palmer,  and  Earned  having  taken  the  measure 
of  C.   C.   Pell  and  J.   D.   E.  Jones. 

Early  in  the  tournament  E.  E.  Mahan  occasioned  surprise  by  defeating 
F.  C.  Colston,  while  F.  J.  Sulloway  caused  an  upset  when  he  ended  the 
aspirations  of  F.   C.   Inman. 

Johnson  won  with  ridiculous  ease  from  R.  H.  Palmer,  allowing  him  but- 
two  games,  while  Earned  beat  Jones  in  the  closest  match  of  the  tourna- 
ment. Jones  twice  needed  but  a  point  to  win,  but  on  each  occasion  let  the 
opportunity  slip  by. 

The  final  round  was  disappointing.  Earned  started  well,  winning  the- 
second  set,  7/5,  and  forcing  the  first  to  6/4,  but  thereafter  Johnson  won  as 
he  chose  and  outclassed  his  opponent  in  every  style  of  play.  Earned  was 
passed  with  painful  regularity,  despite  his  well-known  ability  to  cover  the 
net  and  Johnson's  wonderful  accuracy  unnerved  his  opponent  completely 
toward  the  end. 

The  doubles  resulted  in  a  great  reversal  of  form  when  C.  C.  Pell  and  F. 
De  Rham  defeated  W.  A.  Lamed  and  R.  D.  Wrenn.  The  former  pair 
played  fast,  steady  tennis,  while  neither  the  champion,  nor  ex-champion, 
seemed  at  all  sure  of  their  strokes.  Later  in  the  tournament  De  Rham. 
and  Pell  were  beaten  in  two  deuce  sets  by  Palmer  and  Jones,  who  subse- 
quently beat  D.  Mathey  and  J.  A.  C.  Colston  in  the  final  round  in  straight 
sets.     Summaries :

Championship  of  Mexico. 

For  the  third  successive  time  Claude  Butlin  of  Mexico  captured  the 
Mexican  Championship,  played  at  the  Mexico  Country  Club,  the  week  of 
April  14,  1909.  Although  C.  Hobart,  Irving  Wright  and  other  American 
cracks  did  not  repeat  their  visit  of  1908,  the  entry  was  a  representative  one 
and  was  aided  by  the  presence  of  Nat  Browne  and  S.  Sinsabaugh  of  Los 
Angeles.  Miss  May  Sutton  and  her  sister,  Florence,  took  part  and,  as 
usual,   divided   the   honors   in   the    ladies'    singles. 

In  the  men's  singles,  Sinsabaugh  met  H.  M.  MacQuiston  and  lost  in 
straight  sets  in  the  second  round,  but  Browne  was  more  fortunate,  winning 
easily  from  H.  C.  Bridgers,  the  Carolina  champion.  Browne's  success 
was  short-lived,  though,  for  his  next  opponent  was  Butlin.  The  Cali- 
fornian  made  a  plucky  stand,  but  Butlin's  splendid  volleying  was  too  fast 
and    Browne  was   retired   at'  6-3,  6-4. 

The  semi-final  round  resulted  in  easy  victories  for  H.  MacQuiston  and 
Butlin.  MacQuiston  played  R.  M.  Tolin  and  dropped  one  game  in  each 
?et,  while  P.    MacQuiston  did  but  little  better  against   Butlin. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  128 

The  final  match  was  short  and  decisive.  Butlin  took  the  first  set,  6/2. 
The  second  was  extremely  close,  but  at  eight-all  Butlin  broke  through 
MacQuiston's  service  and  won  his  own.  The  third  set  was  over  in  little 
or  no  time.  MacQuiston's  play  had  lost  its  snap  and  Butlin  reeled  off 
game  after  game.  At  5/0  MacQuiston  won  his  only  game  in  the  set  and 
the    seventh   ended    the    match. 

The  MacQuistons  had  their  revenge  in  the  doubles.  They  ran  against 
Butlin  and  Jenkins  in  the  semi-final  and  won  a  hotly  contested  three-set 
match.  In  the  upper  half,  Browne  and  Sinsabaugh  put  out  Stagg  and 
Johnson    in   an    equally    close    encounter. 

The  final  was  a  splendid  five-set  affair.  The  Californians  almost  got 
away  with  the  first  set  and  did  succeed  in  winning  the  second  and  third. 
Then  the  brothers'  perfect  team  work  began  to  take  effect.  As  Browne 
and  Sinsabaugh  let  down  a  bit,  the  Mexicans  forced  a  faster  pace.  They 
won  the  fourth  set,  6/2.  The  deciding  set  was  very  even  up  to  four-all,, 
at  which  point  the  MacQuistons  braced  and  ran  two  successive  games. 

Miss    May    Sutton    and    Sinsabaugh    won    the    mixed    doubles    final    from 
Miss   Butlin  and   her  champion  brother.      It   was   an   odd   contest,   but   inas- 
much as  Butlin's  tactics  of  covering  practically   all   the   court  were  bound 
to  defeat  him,  the  result  was  never  in  doubt.     The  summaries

Championship  of  Cuba. 


J.  Zayas  repeated  his  success  of  the  previous  year  when  he  defended 
liis  title  of  Champion  of  Cuba  against  M.  Morales  at  the  tournament 
tegun  on  ]\Iarch  29,  1909,  at  the  Vedado  Tennis  Club  in  Havana. 
Morales  had  several  narrow  escapes,  but  none  to  compare  witn  his  match 
in  the  final  round  against  G.  V^illalba.  Five  long,  terrific  sets  were 
needed  to  uecide  the  winner  and  before  the  match  ended  each  man 
"had  been  numberless  times  within  a  point  of  victory.  Villalba  started 
well  and  won  the  first  two  sets,  each  by  the  narrow  margin  of  7/5. 
The  third  set  went  to  Morales  in  six.  straight  games,  but  Villalba  came 
back  quickly  in  t^.e  fourth.  Repeatedly  a  stroke  won  would  have  given 
him  the  match,  but  Morales  finally  pulled  out  at  10/8.  The  fifth  set 
found  both  players  greatly  fatigued,  but  each  hanging  to  the  other  and 
honors  even  at  five-all.  Morales  then  made  a  final  effort,  which  lasted 
just  long  enough  to  give  him  the  necessary  two  games.  Villalba  was 
all    in   and    was    incapable    of   responding    to    Morales'    rally. 

Morales  and  Villalba  played  together  in  doubles  and,  with  the  ex- 
ception of  a  five-set  match  with  Santa  Cruz  and  Valverde  in  the  semi- 
final, were  in  no  danger  of  defeat.  In  the  final  they  won  from  Zayas 
and   Jorrin    at    6/4,    3/6,    6/2,    6/2. 

The  ladies'  singles  went  to  Srta.  Rosa  Ferran.  She  won  the  final 
match  in  an  extremely  close  contest  with  Srta.  Emma  Irabis.  The 
score  was  2)l(>,  6/2,  9/7.  Srta.  Ferran  and  S.  Villalba  won  the  mixed 
event    quite    easily.      The    summaries :

Metropolitan  Championship. 


Another  name  will  go  down  in  the  annals  of  tennis  history  as  winner  of 
that  famous  old  event,  the  Metropolitan  Championship.  It  is  that  of  F.  C. 
Inman  who  triumphed  over  a  field  of  eighty  entries  on  the  courts  of  the 
West  Side  Club's  new  grounds  at  VanCortlandt  Park. 

While  the  field  was  the  largest  that  has  yet  contested  for  the  coveted 
title,  such  men  as  Alexander,  Little,  Hackett  and  Fischer  were  not  included 
in  the  draw,  thereby  detracting  much  from  the  interest  of  the  event.  Pal- 
mer, Inman,  Touchard  and  MoUenhauer  were  the  substitutes. 

The  doubles  teams  numbered  thirty-two,  of  which  Hackett  and  R.  D. 
Little  were  by  far  the  best,  but,  to  the  surprise  of  everyone,  the  inter- 
nationalists went  down  before  the  combined  attack  of  H.  Tallant  and  L. 
E.  Mahan. 

Play  began  on  Monday,  June  14,  and  the  first  round  produced  an  upset 
when  Tallant  defeated  Touchard.  Tallant  really  surpassed  himself  and 
was  more  than  a  match  for  his  younger  opponent. 

In  the  second  round  MoUenhauer  was  the  next  of  possible  winners  to 
meet  defeat.  His  victor  was  W.  M.  Hall,  who  won  in  a  match  remarkable; 
for  its  length.  The  score  was,  2/6,  10/8,  12/10.  Inman  met  in  succession 
L.  E.  Mahan,  whom  he  beat  quite  easily  ;  G.  A.  L.  Dionne,  who  was  out- 
classed, and  C.  C.  Kelly,  who  also  failed  to  get  a  set.  Palmer's  path  to  the 
final  round  was  almost  as  easy.  In  the  fourth  round  he  engaged  C.  M. 
Bull,  Jr.,  and  the  latter  won  the  second  set,  but  his  matches,  with  that 
exception,  were  won  in  straight  sets. 

The  final  round  was  productive  of  both  good  and  bad  tennis.  Inman  at 
first  failed  to  control  his  strokes,  and  his  severe  twist  service  was  markedly- 
off.  Palmer  played  with  more  certainty,  and  Inman  won  but  a  single  game 
in  the  opening  set.  From  then  to  the  end  of  the  match,  however.  Palmer 
became  hopelessly  erratic.  Inman,  finding  he  could  win  by  his  opponent's 
errors,  merely  put  every  ball  back  with  little  regard  for  pace  or  placement,, 
and  Palmer's  nets  and  outs  were  so  consistent  that  only  eight  of  the 
twenty-six  games  played  went  to  his  credit. 

The  doubles  were  landed  by  that  excellent  team,  H.  Torrance  and  O.  H. 
Hinck.  After  their  bewildering  defeat  of  Hackett  and  Little,  Tallant  and 
Mahan  were  generally  conceded  to  have  had  the  tournament  won,  but  the 
mediocrity  of  their  exhibition  was  no  less  marked  than  their  brilliance  of 
the  day  before,  and  the  Jersey  pair  won  by  the  one-sided  score  of  6/4,  6/3, 
6/0.  Considered,  however,  in  the  face  of  their  victory  at  6/3,  6/2,  over  E. 
P.  Earned  and  C.  F.  Watson,  Jr.,  on  the  previous  day,  the  result  was  not 
surprising. 

The  ladies'  singles  ended  in  a  very  one-sided  victory  for  Miss  L.  Ham- 
mond over  Miss  M.  Wagner.  The  latter  was  decidedly  off,  but  Miss  Ham- 
mond was  never  better  and  captured  the  title  in  two-love  sets. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  127 

The  fastest  mixed  doubles  match  played  in  many  seasons  was  won  by 
Miss  Wagner  and  H.  MoUenhauer  in  the  final  round  from  Miss  Hammond 
and  R.  D.  Little.  The  former  combination  won  in  straight  sets,  but  never- 
theless the  contest  was  extremely  close.  Both  men  hit  with  great  speed, 
but  their  partners  volleyed  with  remarkable  adroitness  and  were  not  in  the 
least  worried  by  the  pace  they  maintained  throughout  the  match.  A  fea- 
ture of  play  was  Miss  Wagner's  ability  to  smash.  She  rarely  missed  over- 
head and  counted  as  many  aces  as  her  hard  hitting  partner.  The  sum-

Annual  Seabright  Tournament. 


The  greatest  victory  of  N.  W.  Niles'  career  was  his  successful  flight 
through  the  high-class  field  of  the  Seabright  annual  invitation  event.  As 
usual,  most  of  the  men  competing  were  in  the  top  flight,  although  there 
were  several  pronounced  exceptions.  W.  A.  Larned,  Alexander  and 
Wright,  were  conspicuous  by  their  absence  and  their  places  were  filled  by 
younger   and   much   inferior   men. 

Niles'  playing  that  week  was  remarkably  fine.  He  disposed  of  E.  P. 
Larned,  R.  LeRoy,  R.  D.  Little  and  K.  H.  Behr  in  succession  and  not 
once  did  he  lose  a  set.  In.  the  challenge  round  he  faced  W.  J.  Clothier, 
but  there  he  met  his  master.  It  was  splendid  tennis  and  intensely  inter- 
esting for  the  spectators,  but  Clothier  led  throughout,  and  there  was  not 
the  slightest  element  of  uncertainty  about  the  outcome.  Niles  played  well 
and  won  the  third  set,  8/6,  but  Clothier  simply  increased  his  speed  and 
aggressiveness  in  the  fourth  set  and  ran  it  out',  6/4. 

Eight  teams  played  in  the  doubles,  and  it  was  fully  up  to  the  singles 
in  point  of  interest  created  and  the  quality  of  tennis  played.  Little  and 
Hackett  played  a  spectacular  and  hard  match  with  W.  F.  Johnson  and 
Clothier  and  the  veterans,  R.  H.  Carleton  and  H.  W.  Slocum,  eliminated 
R.    LeRoy   and  G.   F.    Touchard   from   the   contest. 

In  the  semi-final.  Little  and  Hackett  had  no  trouble  with  Slocum  and 
Carleton,  but  Niles  and  Dabeney  had  a  terrific  struggle  with  M.  D.  Whit- 
man and  G.  L.  Wrenn,  Jr.  Niles  and  Dabney  won  the  opening  set,  6/2, 
but  could  not  get  a  lead  in  the  second.  At  five-all,  Whitman  and  Wrenn, 
by  driving  to  Niles'  feet,  took  the  advantage,  and  Whitman's  service  ac- 
counted  for  the  twelfth   game. 

The  deciding  set  was  filled  with  exciting  rallies  and  long  battles  for  the 
net.  Neither  .side  could  break  through  the.  other's  service,  but  at  ten-all 
Dabney,  by  some  really  wonderful  volleying  and  splendid  drives,  broke 
up  his  opponent's  service  and  landed  the  match  with  his  delivery  on  the 
next    game. 

Tlie  final  was  a  rather  tame  afifair.  Niles  and  Dabney  did  not  play  so 
well  as  they  usually  do,  and  Little  and  Hackett  were  in  splendid  form. 
They  maintained  a  big  lead  throughout,  but  occasional  spurts  of  brief 
duration  by  the  Bostonians,  prevented  a  hopelessly  one-sided  fight.  The

Englewood  Meeting. 


In  spite  of  many  defaults,  which  included  W.  A.  Larned's,  the  annual 
tournament  of  the  Englewood  (N.  J.)  Field  Club  was  the  most  successful 
the  club  has  ever  held.  The  date  assigned,  June  7,  was  a  very  early  one,, 
but  it  did  not  prevent  R.  D.  Little,  E.  P.  Earned,  Karl  Behr  and  other 
cracks,   from   competing. 

With  the  first  round,  upsets  began.  Most  prominent  of  these  was 
G.  A.  L.  Dionne's  crushing  defeat  of  R.  H.  Palmer.  Palmer  lost  the  first 
set,  6/1,  and  when  within  one  point  of  losing  the  second  by  the  same  score^ 
defaulted.  E.  P.  Earned  had  a  narrow  escape  when  he  played  H.  C. 
Martin.  Martin  led  at  5/1  and  40/15  in  the  deciding  set,  but  Earned  made 
a  remarkable  uphill  fight,  eventually  winning  it,  7/5.  In  the  same  round 
E.  P.  Fischer  showed  a  flash  of  his  oldtime  form  when  he  took  the  middle 
set  of  his  match  with  Little.  In  this  round  H.  H.  Hackett  and  W.  A. 
Earned   retired. 

Little  had  his  hands  full  with  W.  H.  Connell  in  the  third  round  and  pulled 
out  both  sets  from  unpromising  positions.  Immediately  afterward  he  went 
down  before  Karl  Behr.  Behr  played  a  remarkably  strong  game  and 
Little  never  headed  him  in  either  set.  The  semi-final  round  resulted  in 
decisive  victories  for  Behr  and  Earned.  The  latter  beat  C.  M.  Bull,  Jr.,. 
1 1/9,  6/2,  and  Behr  smothered  O.  H.  Hinck  in  the  other  half.  Hinck  was 
never  in  the  running,  but  Bull  had  a  chance  to  force  Earned  to  three  sets. 
The  final  round  was  played  before  an  immense  gallery.  Behr  was  in  rare 
form  and  took  four  games  in  jig  time.  Then,  Earned  came  in  for  his  only 
game  of  the  set.  Earned  did  much  better  in  the  second.  He  led  at  zlz 
and  4/3,  but  Behr  increased  his  pace  and  passed  him  rapidly  as  he  came 
in.  Earned  let  his  opportunity  slip  and  Behr  ran  three  straight  games. 
The  third  set  was  faster  than  the  others,  but  Behr  was  still  coming  out  of 
the  rallies  unscathed.  Earned  tired  mightily,  but  Behr's  streak  was  toa 
good  and  the  match  ended  with   the  set  at  6/3. 

The  surprise  of  the  doubles  was  W.  A.  Larned's  and  G.  L  .Wrenn,  Jr.'s 
defeat  by  O.  H.  Hinck  and  H.  Torrance  in  three  sets.  Earned  was  quite 
erratic,  however,  and  without  his  telling  speed  and  accuracy,  Wrenn's 
constant  lobs  were  quite  useless.  The  winners  played  finely,  Torrance 
steady  as  a  rock  and  Hinck's  tremendous  reach  making  his  volleys  appear 
almost  miraculous.  These  two  met  Hackett  and  Little  in  their  next  match, 
but  the  result  was  disappointing.  They  seemed  fatigued  and  did  not  do 
themselves  justice.      Little  and   Hackett  won   at  6/3,   6/2. 

In  the  final  round  Behr  and  Fischer  got  a  great  drubbing  from  Hackett 
and  Little.  The  winners  played  smoothly  with  few  errors.  Hackett  was 
particularly  good.  They  worked  Behr  and  Fischer  out  of  position  time 
and  time  again.  Fischer  played  a  hard  clean  game,  but  his  partner  was 
quite  unsteady,  mingling  good  and  bad  shots  continually.  The  score  was 
6/1,   6/3,   7/5.  '  ,     ,      ^ 

Miss  E.  Wildey  won  the  ladies'  singles.  Here  agam  many  of  the  best 
players  of  the  country  competed.  Surprises  were  numerous.  Miss  M. 
Wagner  beat  Miss  E.  Hammond,  but  lost  in  the  next  round  to  Mrs.  G.  E. 
Chapman.  Mrs.  Chapman  was  decisively  beaten  by  Miss  Wildey  in  the 
final   round  at    6/4  and  6/2.

Women's  Annual  Fall  Tournament  at  Longwood. 

One  of  the  most  important  women's  events  of  1909  began  on  September 
27.  It  was  the  annual  fall  tournament  at  Longwood  for  the  Sheafe  Chal- 
lenge   Cup. 


134  SPALDING'S   LAWN   TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

An  unusually  large  entry  was  recorded  and  many  of  New  York's  crack 
players,  with  practically  all  the  Eastern  experts,  were  found  to  be  some- 
where in  the  list.   Miss  C.   B.   Neely,  ot  Chicago,  also  competed. 

The  first  match  of  interest  came  in  the  second  round  when  Miss  E. 
Rotch  met  Miss  A.  S.  Browning.  Miss  Rotch  had  a  painfully  narrow 
escape,  and  Miss  Browning  proved  herself  a  better  player  than  anyone 
thought  her.  The  deciding  set  required  eighteen  games.  in  the  same 
round  Miss  Eleanora  Sears  beat  Miss  E.  Wildey  quite  easily  and  Miss 
A.    Thorndjke    overcame    Miss    Marion    Homans. 

A  terrific  struggle  took  place  inthe  third  round  when  Miss  Evelyn 
Sears,  ex-national  champion,  and  Mrs.  Chapman  met.  Miss  Sears  played 
Mrs.  Chapman  to  a  standstill  in  the  first  set,  winning  at  6/i,  but  the 
New  Yorker  pulled  out  the  second  from  a  perilous  position,  at  7/5.  The 
■deciding  set  was  fiercely  fought.  First  one  led,  then  the  other,  but  finally 
'  at  nine-all.  Miss  Sears  broke  through  her  opponent's  service  and  won  the 
niatch  with  her  own  on  the  twentieth  game.  Miss  Neely  was  retired  later 
in  the  day  by  Miss  Rotch,  but  it  was  a  close  match  from  beginning  to  end. 
In  the  semi-final  round.  Miss  Evelyn  Sears  vanquished  Miss  Thorndyke 
in  three  sets  and  Mrs.  M.  Shurtleff,  who  had  occasioned  surprise  by 
her  easy  victory  over  Miss  Eleanor  Sears,  in  the  previous  round,  lost 
to  Miss  Rotch.  Because  Miss  Rotch  defaulted  her  match  in  the  final. 
Miss  Sears  became  Mrs.  Barger-Wallach's  opponent  in  the  challenge  round. 
These  two  old  rivals,  each  perfectly  familiar  with  the  other's  game, 
played  a  long,  rather  tedious  match.  Both  players  have  a  weak  back- 
hand, but  neither  could  play  consistently  to  that  vulnerable  point.  Mrs. 
^ya]lach  covered  her  left  side  remarkably,  but  Miss  Sears  found  it  more 
difficult  to  run  around  her  opponent's  drives.  They  were  faster  and  better 
placed,  as  is  shown  by  Mrs.  Wallach's  score  of  39  aces  on  that  particular 
stroke  against  19  for  Miss  Sears.  That  factor  alone  was  responsible  for 
Mrs.  Wallach's  victory  at  6/3,  ^/(y,  6/3,  for  Miss  Sears  was,  if  anything, 
better  at   the  majority  of  other  shots   tried. 

Mrs.  Wallach  scored  another  triumph  a  little  later,  when,  paired  with 
Mrs.  G.  L.  Chapman,  she  won  a  very  close  match  from  Miss  C.  B. 
Neely  and  Miss  E.  Rotch  in  the  final  round  in  doubles.  The  score  was

New  York  Tennis  Club  Open  Championship. 

T.  R.  Pell  was  beaten  for  the  second  time  in  two  weeks  by  G.  F, 
Touchard  when  they  clashed  in  the  challenge  round  of  the  Xew  York 
Tennis  Club's  open  tournament.  Play  began  June  2.  Touchard  worked 
through  the  tournament  after  several  narrow  escapes.  Closest  of  these  was 
his  match  with  H.  H.  Hackeft.  Hackett  led  at  5/1  on  the  deciding  set, 
but  Touchard  started  a  remarkable  streak  and  ran  out  six  games  in  little 
or  no  time.  In  the  final  he  faced  L.  M.  Burt,  but  was  not  even  forced  to 
his  limit.  Probably  with  his  defeat  of  a  week  previous  in  mind,  Pell 
started  in  badly.  In  fact,  he  played  poorly  throughout  the  four  sets.  He 
had  a  dozen  opportunities  to  tie  the  score  in  the  fourth  set,  but  each  time 
a  ridiculous  error  or  a  shot  of  Touchard's  prevented  him.  It  was  slow, 
uninteresting  tennis,  played  almost  entirely  from  the  baseline  and  with  a 
care  which  indicated  plainly  the  regard  in  which  each  held  the  other. 

Hackett  and  R.  D.  Little  had  things  all  their  own  way  in  the  doubles. 
They  met  Pell  and  Grant  in  the  final  round,  the  latter  pair  having  previ- 
ously beaten  Fischer  and  K.  Behr  with  unlocked  for  ease,  and  while  in- 
teresting tennis  resulted,  the  losers  were  outclassed.  Neither  Pell  nor 
Grant  was  steady,  but  Hackett  and  Little  played  with  the  certainty  and 
smoothness  of  midseason  form.     The  summaries  :

Westchester  Country  Club  Doubles. 

The  W  estchester  Country  Club  of  Westchester,  N.  Y.,  held  its  annual 
invitation  round  robin  doubles  tournament  the  week  of  July  6,  and,  as 
usual,  the  five  teams  drawn  were  of  the  first  calibre.  The  Earned  and 
Wrenn  brothers  took  part,  but  after  the  first  day's  play,  Champion  W.  A. 
Earned  withdrew  because  of  an  injury  to  his  foot  and  the  vacancy  was 
iilled  by  A.  S.  Dabnev,  Jr.  Hackett  and  Little  won  the  meet  after  playing 
an  extra  match  with  the  Wrenns,  with  whom  they  had  tied  for  first  place.

KnoUwood  Country  Club  Invitation  Doubles. 

Two  weeks  previous  to  the  National  Championship,  the  Knollwood 
Country  Club  of  White  Plains,  N.  Y.,  gave  an  invitation  doubles  tourna- 
ment in  which   seven   of  the   best  teams   of  the   country   took  part. 

The  Coast  team,  McLoughlin  and  Janes,  gave  an  indication  of  their 
calibre  when  they  eliminated  Little  and  LeRoy  in  the  first  round,  after 
three  slashing  sets,  and  then,  when  their  defeat  seemed  a  certainty,  pulled 
out  an  uphill  battle  with  the  Southern  champions.  Pell  and  Grant,  who 
liad,  in  the  opening  round,  taken  Niles  and  Dabney  into  camp  rather 
easily. 

In  the  lower  half,  Sinsabaugh  and  Bundy  won  from  F.  C.  Inman  and 
G.  O.  Wagner  in  a  close  set-to  and  immediately  afterward  faced  W.  A. 
Earned    and    R.    D.    Wrenn.    It    was    a    great    tight,    ending    when    darkness 


138  SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

intervened  at  five-all  in  the  deciding  set.  The  following  day  the  third  set 
was  replayed,  but  the  Californians  failed  to  get  started  before  the  Eastern- 
ers had  run  out  six  straight  games.  Meanwhile,  the  National  title-holders, 
Hackett  and  Alexander,  had  outclassed  Long  and  MacQuiston  and  were 
ready  to  take  on  Larned  and  Wrenn.  In  each  set  Lal-ned  and  Wrenn 
jumped  away  for  a  big  lead.  They  forced  the  score  in  the  first  to  3/1 
before  the  champions  made  their  strokes  tell  for  five  straight  games  and  the 
second  set  stood  at  4/1  against  them  before  Hackett  and  Alexander  again 
braced.  When  they  did,  they  reeled  oiY  game  after  game  until  the  set 
ended  in  their  favor,  6/4.  It  was  the  best  match  of  the  meeting  and  demon- 
strated the  remarkable  resourcefulness  of  the  champions  when  forced  to 
their   best. 

The  final  between  Janes  and  McLoughlin  and  Hackett  and  Alexander 
was  disappointing.  The  latter  pair  was  never  better  and  forced  the  play  at 
such  a  fast  pace  that  the  visitors  had  not  a  chance  to  even  settle  down  to 
their  normal  stride.     The   score  was  6/4,   6/1. 


The  Bronx  Championship. 


T.  R.  Pell  and  G.  F.  Touch? rd  had  their  first  of  a  series  of  meetings 
when  they  met  in  the  final  round  of  the  Bronx  championship.  The  tour- 
nament, which  began  May  24,  was  played  on  the  Bedford  Park  Lawn 
Tennis  Club's  courts  of  New  York  city.  Many  of  the  Metropolitan 
cracks  entered,  including  W.  C.  Grant,  H.  Tallant,  R.  LeRoy  and  R.  H. 
Palmer. 

In  the  third  round  Grant  defaulted  to  W.  M.  Hall  when  the  latter  was 
within  a  game  of  defeat.  In  the  next  bracket  Pell  won  very  easily  from 
Hall,  and  Tallant  took  the  first  set  of  his  match  with  Touchard.  "Palmer 
was  four  times  within  a  point  of  losing  to  M.  S.  Clark  and  R.  T.  Bryan 
had   little  trouble   disposing   of  A.    Ostendorf. 

The  semi-final  resulted  in  easy  victories  for  Pell  and  Touchard.  Pell 
was  forced  hard  by  Palmer  in  the  initial  set,  but  scored  six  straight 
games  in  the  second.  Bryan  was  no  match  for  Touchard,  who  outgener- 
aled him  at  every  stage. 

The  final  round  was  hard  fought,  wearing  tennis.  Losing  the  first  set, 
6/3,  Pell  led  all  through  the  second  and  forced  his  advantage  to  5/3  in 
the  third.  Then  Touchard,  by  playing  deep  shots  to  his  forehand  and 
running  in,  changed  the  score  to  6/5  in  his  favor.  Pell  evened  matters 
with  the  following  game,  but  dropped  the  set  with  the  next  two.  The 
fourth  set  was  quickly  over.  Touchard  led  to  5/2  and  ended  the  match 
after  losing  two  more  games.  Pell  became  very  erratic  toward  the  end 
and  made  several  bad  errors  in  the  last  few  games. 

Pell  and  Grant  were  thouKht  to  be  in  a  class  by  themselves  in  doubles, 
but  Touchard  and  Connell  gave  them  a  hard  tussel  in  the  final  round. 
Connell  played  finely,  particularly  on  service  and  volleying,  but  Touchard 
was  very  erratic  and  failed  to  give  proper  support.  In  the  first'  two  sets 
they  had  commanding  leads,  but  Pell  and  Grant  pulled  out  by  good  team 
work  and  generally  consistent  plav.      The   summaries:

Old    Dominion  Tournament. 

On  June  21  the  Hermitage  Golf  Club  of  Richmond,  Va.,  gave  its  annual 
open  tournament  for  the  Old  Dominion  Championship.  A  number  of 
visiting  players  competed,  including  R.  H.  Palmer,  T.  R.  Pell,  W.  B.  and 
A.  S.  Cragin  of  New  York,  and  R.  L.  James  and  Nat  Thornton  of  Phila- 
delphia   and   Atlanta,    respectively. 

In  the  third  round  W.  C.  Grant  retired  after  leading  at  4/1  in  the  de- 
ciding set  of  his  match  witn  F.  Geoghegan,  and  B.  M.  Grant  disposed  of 
A.  S.  Cragin  in  three  sets.  F.  G.  Pollard  forced  W.  B.  Cragin  to  three 
sets,  but  Cragin  played  poorly  against  Thornton  in  the  next'  round  and  was 
beaten,  6/3  and  6/1.  In  the  semi-final.  Palmer  was  never  in  danger  in  his 
match  with  B.  M.  Grant  and  Thornton  dropped  only  four  games  to  C. 
Whitlock.  The  final  rouna,  with  Palmer  opposed  to  Thornton,  went  in 
straight  sets  to  the  former,  but  it  was  nevertheless  a  pretty  even  fight. 
Palmer  took  the  opening  set  at  6/3,  but'  Thornton  played  well  in  the  next 
and  led  at  5/3.  Palmer  changed  his  tactics  then  and  by  careful  play  and 
a  strong  net  attack  ran  out  four  straight  games.  The  third  set  was  less 
interesting.  The  first  four  games  were  divided  before  Thornton  began  to 
fall  off.  Palmer  increased  the  pace  accordingly  and  had  little  trouble  in 
the  next  four  games.  The  challenge  match  was  a  repetition  of  the  final. 
James  made  a  good  stand,  carrying  the  games  to  five-all  in  the  initial  set 
before  Palmer  ran  out.  The  second  and  third  went  to  Palmer  in  short 
order.  In  each  set  James  got  three  games,  but  Palmer's  needlessly  hard 
drives,  many  of  which  flew  way  out,  constituted  the  marjority  of  James' 
points. 

Pell  and  Grant  carried  off  the  doubles,  but  Grant  and  Thornton  very 
nearly  upset  their  calculations.  Thes"  teams  met  in  the  semi-final  round 
and  a  great  contest  was  the  result.  The  Southerners  led  at  5/4  and  vantage 
in  the  first  set  and  won  the  second,  9/7.  The  deciding  set  was  even  at 
three-all,  when  both  Grant  and  Thornton  became  unsteady.  A  few  bad 
errors  of  the  Atlanta  pair  and  more  aggressive  play  by  the  New  York  team 
ended  matters   with   the   following  three  games.

Bridgers  and  Pollard  made  a  mighty  effort  in  the  final  round  and  won 
the  second  set  at  11/9  before  they  were  dominated.  The  rest  of  the  match 
was  very  one  sided,  Grant  and  Pell  finally  winning  at  7/5,  9/1 1,  6/2,  6/0.

SrALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  141 

Tntercolle^iate   Championships 

Triumphant  in  both  singles  and  doubles,  the  University  of  Pennsylvania 
left  but  small  consolation  to  the  remaining  six  institutions'  representatives 
in  the  annual  Intercollegiate  championship.  September  8  was  the  date  of 
commencement  and  the  Merion  Cricket  Club  the  scene  of  the  tournament". 
The  entry  of  Long,  from  the  University  of  California,  added  greatly  to 
the   interest    in    the   event. 

Nothing  unusual  occurred  in  the  first  round  and  only  one  match  of 
importance  was  played  in  the  second  round.  That  was  between  R.  A. 
Holden  of  Yale  and  G.  P.  Gardner  of  Harvard.  Gardner  won  the  iirst 
set  after  twenty-two  games  had  been  played,  but  the  strain  was  too  much 
for  Holden.  He  lost  the  second  set,  6/3,  and  made  no  effort  whatever  to 
win  the  third.  Gardner's  path  was  blocked  immediately  afterward  by 
Long.  The  latter  played  a  free  hitting  game  and  had  Gardner  beaten 
almost  immediately.  The  Harvard  champion  was  never  in  the  running, 
and  seven  games  was  his  tally  for  the  three  set's.  In  the  same  round  W.  F. 
Johnson  of  Pennsylvania  won  easily  from  Stevens,  the  last  of  Yale's  color 
bearers.  Sweetzer  of  Harvard  and  A.  Thayer  of  Pennsylvania  filled  the 
other  two  semi-final  brackets.  Johnson  was  not  at  his  best  when  he  faced 
his  classmate,  Thayer.  He  was  very  erratic  and  unsteady,  but  he  played 
carefully  and  ultimately  won  at  3/6,  6/0,  7/5,  6/4.  Against  Long, 
Sweetzer  made  a  much  better  showing  than  was  expected  of  him.  He 
was  much  steadier,  but  not  quite  aggressive  enough  to  win.  He  had 
plenty  of  opportunities,  for  Long  was  very  erratic,  but  excessive  care 
through  overanxiety  proved  his  undoing.  His  strokes  lacked  pace  and 
many  shots  that  he  should  have  killed  were  hit  soft  enough  for  Long 
to    return. 

The  final,  while  not  particularly  good  tennis,  furnished  plenty  of  ex- 
citement. Johnson's  slow  chops  and  clever  placing  aggravated  Long 
extremely,  and  he  dropped  the  first  set  at  6/4.  Then  he  did  better  by 
rushing  to  the  net  and  playing  to  Johnson's  backhand.  Long  won  the 
next  two  sets  at  6/3  and  7/5,  respectively.  The  fourth  set  proved  the 
turning  point.  Both  men  had,  and  continued  to  make,  numerous  errors, 
but  Long  steadied  somewhat  and  led  at  5/4.  At  4o/3Cf,  or  set  point, 
Long  smashed.  It  was  a  very  close  shot  to  decide,  but  the  linesman 
called  it  out.  The  decision  so  affected  Long  that  he  faltered  badly  and 
Johnson  ran  out  three  games  before  the  Californian  had  regained  his  self- 
possession.  Long  braced  in  the  first  half  of  the  fifth  set  and  won  three 
straight  games,  but  he  slumped  again,  owing  to  repeated  warnings  against 
foot-faulting.  Johnson  forged  ahead  for  a  lead  of  4/3.  A  long  deuce  game 
then  went  to  Long,  but  it  was  his  last  ;  Johnson  ran  out  the  set  and 
match  by  a  series  of  clever  chops  and  well  placed  shots  to  Long's  deep 
backhand.  The  Californian  was  not  on  edge  in  that  match,  but  Johnson's 
victory  was  well  earned.  He  stuck  to  his  work  when  he  seemed  hope- 
lessly beaten  and  improved  as  the  match  progressed.  Johnson  and 
Thayer  won   the    doubles   as  was   expected.     The    summaries: —

SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL.  143 

Interscholastic   Championships 

Inasmuch  as  M.  E.  McLoughlin  attended  the  Lowell  High  School  of 
San  Francisco  and  was  therefore  eligible  for  the  ^National  Interscholastic 
Championship,  there  was  not  much  interest  manifested  in  that  usually 
attractive  event  as,  with  the  young  Californian  playing,  the  other  three 
schoolboys  were  not  conceded  the  slightest  chance  for  the  title.  Be- 
sides McLoughlin  there  were  but  three  other  entrants,  G.  M.  Church, 
Columbia ;  E.  H.  Whitney,  Harvard,  and  C.  L.  Johnston,  Princeton's 
representative. 

Johnston  was  unfortunate  enough  to  draw  McLoughlin,  and  the  ensu- 
ing play  was  painfully  one-sided.  Johnston  was  outclassed  in  every  de- 
partment   of    the    game    and    was    beaten,    6/0,    6/2,  '  6/2. 

Church  apparently  was  nervousness  personified  when  he  played  Whit- 
ney, and  was  way  below  his  true  form.  The  frail  looking  youngster 
was  hopelessly  erratic,  and  Whitney,  cool  and  steady,  was  not  once 
headed    in    the    entire    match.      Score,    6/2,    6/2,    6/4. 

The  following  day  Whitney  went  down  before  McLoughlin.  Although 
beaten  in  straight  sets,  Whitney  gave  a  better  account  of  himself  than 
his  most  sanguine  supporters  hoped  for.  He  played  steadily  and  was 
quick  to  take  advantage  of  his  Western  rival's  overconfidence.  McLough- 
lin played  carelessly  and  only  became  serious  when  the  Boston  boy 
brought  his   score   too   close.     The   score   was   6/1,    7/"^,    6/2.

144  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Middle  West  Tennis 

By  Line  Smash. 

Perhaps  no  season  in  lawn  tennis  has  been  marked  so  distinctly  by 
•successes  in  every  department  as  that  of  1909.  The  vogue  that  the  game 
attained  among  society  people,  the  gain  in  numbers  playin'g  the  net  game, 
the  character  of  the  competitions  in  the  several  district  championships,  the 
interest  in  the  state  and  interstate  tournaments  and  the  development  of 
new  stars,  to  shine  later  in  the  firmament  of  tennis,  all  aided  in  making 
the  season  one  of  absolute  satisfaction  to  the  promoters  of  the  competitions 
as  well  as  the  officials  of  the  Western  Association. 

Naturally  the  Western  Championship  tournament  and  the  National  pre- 
liminaries in  doubles,  marked  the  high-water-mark  of  interest  in  Western 
competitions.  When  Melville  H.  Long,  the  young  Californian  expert,  won 
the  Western  championship,  defeating  Nat  Emerson  of  Cincinnati,  in  the 
challenge  round,  he  added  to  the  laurels  the  Pacific  Coast  contingent 
gained  on  its  way  to  the  East.  Long  showed  that  he  was  a  tennis  player 
ot  the  first  magnitude,  not  so  much  by  bearing  Emerson,  as  by  accom- 
plishing it  in  straight  sets.  His  companion,  Maurice  McLoughlin,  had 
turned  the  same  trick  at  Lake   Minnetonka,   Minn.,  the  week   before. 

The  four  teams  that  came  to  Onwentsia  for  this  doubles  feature  were 
made  up  of  the  younger  generation  of  players.  R.  A.  Holden,  Jr.,  of  the 
Western  team,  is  a  young  Cincinnati  man  attending  Yale ;  A.  S.  Dabney 
and  N.  W.  Niles  of  the  Eastern  team  were  both  undergraduates  at  Harvard, 
while  T.  R.  Pell  and  W.  C.  Grant,  of  the  Southern  team,  are  young  iti 
years  although  experienced  in  tournament  play.  McLoughlin,  the  Cali- 
fornia wonder,   is  only  nineteen,   while  Janes  may  be   called   &  veteran. 

One  of  the  strong  movements  in  Western  tennis  noted  last  year  was 
launched  at  the  Cincinnati  Country  Club,  when  the  Tri-State  Tennis  Asso- 
ciation and  the  Queen  City  tennis  men  tendered  a  dinner  to  the  visiting 
players  who  partTcipated  in  the  championship.  Plans  were  disctissed  for 
a  great  intercity  tennis  league  and  a  national  clay-court  championship. 
Suggestions  were  made  for  both  of  these  event's  by  Dr.  P.  B.  Hawk  of 
Philadelphia,  chairman  of  the  Ranking  Committee.  Dr.  Hawk  played  in  the 
national  meeting  at  Newport  and  while  there,  found  kindred  spirits  who 
agreed  to  revive  the  clay-court  idea.  It  was  pointed  out  that  not  only  are 
there  numerous  clay  courts  around  the  big  centers  of  population  in  the 
East,  but  that  a  great  majority  of  the  courts  in  the  country  are  clay. 

The  advantages  of  an  intercity  tennis  league,  even  if  only  eight  cities  are 
included,  seems  to  be  so  great  that  argument  is  unnecessary.  "Anything 
that  systematizes  tennis  in  the  various  cities,"  once  said  an  authority  on 
the  game,  "will  always  be  welcome.  There  never  can  be  too  much  tennis. 
A  succession  of  leagues  like  the  major  and  minor  leagues  in  baseball  would 
not  be  too  much  of  a  burden.  The  sport  practically  begins  late  in  the 
West,  but  the  fine  fall  weather  makes  it  possible  to  play  the  game  later 
than  the  baseball  experts  play'.  In  a  measure,  a  well  balanced  major  league 
of  tennis  would  act  towards  eliminating  some  of  the  dead  wood  and  make 
for  sharper  and  more  interesting  play." 

From  the  Tri-State  tournament  at  Cincinnati  two  other  matters  im- 
portant to  followers  of  tennis  were  reported.  First  the  leaders  decided  that 
they  would  have  no  mixed  doubles  in  future.  Three  sets  out  of  five  will  be 
played  in  all  of  the  men's  matches  of  the  round  before  the  semi-finals,  as 
well  as  in  the  semi-finals,   final  and   challenge  matches. 

Incidentally  it  was  Cincinnati  that  flashed  a  novelty  in  the  shape  of 
night  tennis  matches.  The  Eagle  Tennis  Club,  which  has  courts  on  Wal- 
nut Hills,  sprung  this  feature  of  the  sport,  the  leaders  of  the  club  urging 
that  if  baseball  and  croquet  could  be  successfully  played  by  electric  light, 
tennis  could  be  also.  The  white  balls  were  admirably  suited  for  the  work, 
and  with  several  dozen  high  power  electric  lamps  showering  brilliancy 
upon  the  courts,  the  members  of  the  club  had  no  trouble  in  taking  advan- 
tage of  the  spare  hours   after  sundown  to  play  matches.

Metropolitan  League  Championship 

Another  big  club  in  the  Metropolitan  district  has  earned  the  distinction 
of  winning  the  league,  and  the  pennant  emblematic  of  the  championship 
will  for  this  year  fly  from  the  Crescent  Athletic  Club's  flagpole.  The 
playing  for  the  Brooklyn  organization  was  done  by  C.  M.  Bull,  Jr.,  and 
H.  C.  Martin.  In  the  other  section,  the  i\ew  York  Lawn  Tennis  Club 
came  through,  but  its  team  of  R.  T.  Bryan  and  W.  C.  Grant  were  beaten 
in  the  three  matches  with  the  Crescent  club  at  Bay  Ridge  and  Bull's  de- 
feat of  Grant  in  the  return  match  at  the  New  York  club  grounds  decided 
the  series  without  further  play.     A  complete  summary  and  table  follows :

Tennis   in   St«  Louis 

The  Triple  A  Club  has  as  large  a  membership  of  tennis  players  as  any 
club  in  the  country,  400  active  members.  That  this  club  made  popular 
the  game  of  tennis  among  the  people  of  St.  Louis  was  quite  obvious 
during  the  Central  Tennis  Championship,  held  under  their  auspices  in 
July,   when  from    1,000   to   3,000   spectators   daily   attended   the   tournament. 

Early  in  the  spring  the  tennis  committee  held  a  Tennis  Pin  Challenge 
Tournament,  putting  up  for  competition  four  gold  pins,  four  silver  pins 
and  four  bronze  pins,  in  a  pretty  design  emblematic  of  the  club's  motto 
and  the  game  of  tennis.  The  prizes  were  given  to  the  twelve  winners,  to 
hold  until  defeated.  The  holder  of  a  bronze  pin  could  be  challenged  to 
defend  same  by  a  player  not  holding  any.  The  bronze  holder  could  chal- 
lenge the  silver  holder,  and  the  silver  holder  could  challenge  the  gold. 
When  the  challenger  won,  they  would  exchange  pins,  which  created  quite 
a  lively  series  of  matches  all  season  among  the  j^layers. 

The  City's  Doubles  Championship  was  won  lay  D.  Jones,  of  the  Triple 
A,  and  Clarence  Gamble  of  the  Country  Ckib  from  A.  G.  Besch  and 
E.  C.  Adkins  of  the  Triple  A.  Silver  cups  were  awarded  the  winners  and 
runners-up.  The  club's  annual  championship  was  held  in  September  and 
ninety-two  players  entered.  The  singles  was  won  by  D.  Jones,  with 
Paul  J.  Gleeson  runner-up,  the  score  being  6/4.  6/0,  6/4.  In  Class  B 
Joseph  Hercules  defeated  Joseph  Lehman,  6/0,  4/6,  6/3,  6/3. 

In  the  club's  doubles  Will  Smithers  and  R.  ]\I.  Hoew  sprung  a  surprise 
on  the  members  by  defeating  D.  Tones  and  E.  C.  Adkins,  6/4,  3/6,  7/5, 
6/8,   8/6. 

This  year  the  club  has  added,  in  addition  to  its  sixteen  clay  courts,  one 
cement   court  and   another   grass   court. 

The  club  is  after  the  National  Clay  Court  Championship  for  1910,  and, 
should  it  be  successful  in  securing  same,  tennis  players  _  all  over  the 
country  can  rest  assured  of  having  a  most  enjoyable  week  if  they  attend 
the  meet  and  become  the  guests  of  the   people.

National   Indoor   Championships 

On  Saturday,  Februao^  19,  1910,  the  preliminary  matches  of  the  National 
.'Indoor  championship  were  begun  in  the  Seventh  Regiment  Armory  of  New 
York  City.  The  field  of  sixty-four  .players  was  the  largest  that  has  ever 
•competed  for  the  indoor  title,  and  included  all  the  veteran  board-iloor 
cracks  with  three  new  players  of  unusual  ability,  namely,  C.  R.  Gardner, 
B.  S.  Prentice  and  R.  A.  Holden,  Jr.  One  thing  marred  the  tournament.  It 
was  the  inability  of  Champion  Theodore  Roosevelt  Pell  to  take  part  on 
account  of  a  long  illness.  With  that  exception,  the  tournament  was  most 
successful,  the  light  being  for  the  better  part  of  the  week  excellent  and 
the   interest  manifested   unusual. 

In  the  first  round  only  two  matches  could  be  justly  called  unexpected 
results,  but  in  both  cases  the  winners'  subsequent  work  removed  all  doubt 
concerning  their  earlier  play.  B.  S.  Prentice  played  well  against  J.  M. 
Stemacher.  The  latter,  however,  was  very  erratic  and  lest  many  points 
.by  most  unaccountable  errors.  W.  C.  De  Mille  was  too  fast  for  B.  M. 
Phillips,  winning  easily  at  6/3,  6/4.  The  surprise  of  the  second  round 
was  the  defeat  of  Calhoun  Cragin  by  Prentice.  The  Seventh's  player  was 
a  bit  unsteady,  but  Prentice  improved  rapidly  and  before  the  third  set 
ended  was  completely  ovitclassing  Cragin.  The  score  was  4/6,  6/1,  6/1.  In 
the  same  round  R.  D.  Richey  met  his  old  rival,  E.  F.  Leo,  and  took  him 
in  tow  after  three  fast  sets;  R.  A.  Holden,  Jr.,  made  short  work  of  S.  H. 
Voshell,  and  the  California  entrant,  C.  R.  Gardner,  about  whom  centered 
more  interest  than  on  any  other  player,  went  through  A.  S.  Cragin  in 
■convincing  fashion.  The  score  was  6/2,  6/1.  M.  S.  Clark  met  defeat  at 
the  hands  of  J.  S.  Cushman  later  in  the  day,  but  he  was  in  anything  but 
;good  shape.  The  third  round  resulted  in  the  downfall  of  two  men  who 
were  conceded  a  chance  for  the  championship.  Prentice  and  W.  B.  Cragin, 
Jr.  Cragin's  aspirations  ended  after  a  rather  slow,  uninteresting  en- 
counter with  G.  F.  Touchard,  and  Prentice  met  his  master  in  the  person 
of  R.  A,  Holden,  Jr.  The  latter  outgeneraled  Prentice  at  every  stage, 
taking  the  match  in  straight  sets.  The  most  interesting  match  in  the 
fourth  round  was  the  Holden-W.  M.  Hall  affair.  Hall's  drives  were  very 
fast  and  true  in  the  first  set,  which  he  won  at  8/6,  but  at  the  beginning 
of  the  second  he  dropped  a  service  game  and  was  never  able  to  overcome 
the  handicap.  At  six-all  he  lost  his  service  again  and  the  set  went  to 
Holden  at  8/6.  The  deciding  set  was  fast,  but  a  big  difference  in  the 
playing  of  the  two  men  was  noticeable.  Holden  was  severe  and  ever  ready 
to  take  chances,  but  always  consistently  steady.  Hall's  play  was  similar 
to  Holden's  in  every  respect  except  that  of  steadiness.  At  critical  times  he 
missed  strokes  that  meant  much  and  Holden  took  the  set,  6/3.  The  other 
winners  in  the  round  were  W.  C.  Grant,  who  defeated  Richey  in  two  6/4 
sets;  Gardner,  against  whom  Cushman  could  do  nothing,  and  Touchard, 
who  disposed   of  W.    Rosenbaum   in   straight  sets. 

Two  entirely  unexpected  victories  were  the  results  of  the  semi-final 
round.  In  the  upper  half.  Holden  met  Grant  and  beat  the  ex-champion  in 
two  sets.  The  Yale  captain  won  by  breaking  through  Grant's  hard  service 
repeatedly.  After  trying,  but  failing  to  handle  it  by  standing  some  fifteen 
feet  back  of  the  base  line,  he  came  in  half  way  between  the  service  and 
back  lines.  The  result  worked  wonders.  He  blocked  his  returns  short  and 
most  of  them  dropped  at  Grant's  feet  as  he  ran  in.  On  the  whole,  however. 
Grant  did  not  play  very  well  and  had  many  opportunities  of  which  he 
failed  to  take  advantage.  The  score  was  9/7,  6/3.  The  second  match  was 
even  more  of  a  surprise  than  the  Grant-Holden  set-to.  Gardner  was  a  big 
favorite  for  final  honors;  consequently,  when  he  went  down  in  straight  sets 
to  Touchard  his  fall  caused  general  astonishment.  His  play  that  day  was 
very  erratic,  however,  and  he  made  innumerable  errors  of  an  inexcusable 
nature.  Touchard  was  very  steady,  and  though  he  was  not  severe  enough 
'On  any  of  his  strokes,  he  had  no  particularly  weak  points.  He  won  at 
6/4  and   6/3.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  151 

The  final  round  was  played  on  Saturday,  the  26th,  before  the  largest 
crowd  of  the  week.  Touchard  started  with  a  rush.  He  ran  in  on  every- 
thing, and  Holden,  while  he  made  few  errors,  had  too  little  pace  to  his 
strokes.  Touchard  killed  many  of  them  outright  and,  as  most  of  Holden's 
shots  were  slow,  managed  to  reach  nearly  everything.  In  that  way  he 
took  the  first  two  sets  at  6/2,  6/1.  At  2/0  in  the  third  set  he  dropped  back 
and  Holden  began  to  come  in.  He  volleyed  excellently  and  took  the  set 
at  6/3.  The  fourth  set  was  quite  even.  Both  men  tried  to  get  the  net,  and 
the  rallies  were  sharp  and  exciting.  Touchard  finally  broke  through 
Holden's  defense  and  at  5/4  and  40/30  needed  but  one  point  to  win.  He 
tried  a  fast  drive,  but  it  missed  the  side  line  by  several  inches.  Holden 
braced  then  and,  after  taking  the  game,  won  the  set  at  8/6.  The  fifth  set 
started  in  much  the  same  way  as  the  fourth.  It  was  even  at  three-all  when 
Touchard  suddenly  increased  his  speed.  Holden,  however,  was  unable  to 
meet  the  greater  strain  required  of  him,  and  in  the  last  three  games  won 
but   two   points. 

The  doubles  were  won  by  Touchard  and  Gardner.  They  were  considered 
the  strongest  team  in  the  draw,  but  they  had  two  narrow  escapes.  Against 
W.  C.  De  Mille  and  O.  M.  Bostwick.  in  the  second  round,  they  led  at  6/2 
and  5/2,  when  Touchard  "blew  up,"  and  the  final  score  was  6/2,  5/7,  6/4. 
Then,  in  the  final  round,  against  W.  B.  Cragin,  Jr.,  and  M.  S.  Charlock, 
Gardner  made  an  ascension.  It  was  a  narrow  escape,  as  the  score  of  6/1, 
3/6,  7/9,  6/1,  6/4  quite  plainly  indicates.  The  doubles  event  was  not  up 
to  its  standard  of  former  years  by  a  wide  margin.  It  was  large  enough, 
but  in  quality  it  was  sadly  deficient.     The  summaries:

WOMEN'S    NATIONAL    INDOOR    CHAMPIONSHIP. 

Beginning  a  month  later  than  in  previous  years,  the  Women's  Indoor 
Championship,  played  in  the  Seventh  Regiment  Armory  of  New  York  City, 
came  to  an  end  on  March  16,  1910.  The  entry  list  was  of  fair  size  and, 
with  the  exception  of  Miss  Elizabeth  Moore's  absence,  quite  up  to  standard 
in  point  of  class. 

By  the  luck  of  the  draw  the  most  important  match  of  the  meetmg  took 
place  in  the  first  round,  when  the  champion,  Miss  Marie  Wagner,-  faced 
Mrs.  F.  S.  Schmitz.  The  latter  was  runner-up  to  Miss  Wagner  in  1908, 
but  since  then  her  game  has  improved  remarkably,  and  their  second 
meeting  resulted  in  a  decided  triumph  for  the  Englishwoman.  Miss  Wag- 
ner fought  hard  for  the  first  set,  but  after  losing  it,  8/6,  fell  off  badly. 
Mrs.  Schmitz  won  the  second,  6/1.  From  then  until  she  reached  the 
final  it  was  plain  sailing. 

On  the  other  side  of  the  draw  Miss  Erna  Marcus,  after  several  sharp 
skirmishes,  managed  to  eliminate  all  of  her  opponents.  In  the  second 
round  Miss  Fanny  Fish  forced  her  to  three  sets  and  a  round  later  Miss 
Clara  Kutroff  proved  an  even  harder  obstacle  to  overcome. 

The  final  was  a  long  but  interesting  battle,  with  Mrs.  Schmitz  always 
holding  the  upper  hand  after  the  first  set.  Carelessness  cost  her  a  win 
in  two  sets,  for  she  led  in  the  first  at  5/2  and  40/15-  The  second  and 
Ithird  were  won  at  8/6  and  6/3-  In  the  last  set  Mrs.  Schmitz  had  a  lead 
of    4/1,    but    Miss    Marcus    almost    succeeded    in    making    it    four-all.       Ihe

CLUB  CHAMPIONSHIP  OF  THE  NICE  LAWN   TENNIS    CLUB. 

For  the  club  championship  in  singles,  which  began  on  February  7,  1910, 
A.  Holmes  (America)  easily  went  through  in  straight  sets,  defeating  R. 
Chalier   (France),  in  the  final  as  he  pleased  6/0,  7/5,  6/0. 

For  the  doubles  championship  it  was  expected  that  Bostwiqk  and  Holmes 
would  easily  win,  as  they  had  been  defeating  Evans  and  Caudery  almost 
daily,  but  they  had  an  off  day  and  were  defeated  9/7,  5/7,  6/4,  6/3. 

The  ladies'  championship  was  won  by  Mrs.  Nutcombe  Quicke,  defeating 
in  the  final  Miss  B.  Darbyshire  (a  former  holder),  6/3,  8/6. 

SAN  REMO  TOURNAMENT   (ITALIAN  RIVIERA  CHAMPIONSHIP). 

Artemas  Holmes  romped  through  the  open  singles  which  began  February 
14  at  San  Remo,  with  only  the  loss  of  eight  games  in  all,  and  now  has  two 
legs  on  the  challenge  cup.  In  the  final  round  he  met  H.  B.  Routledge, 
whom  he  defeated  6/0,  6/1,  6/0.  With  A.  C.  Bostwick,  Holmes  won  the 
doubles,   defeating  C.   W.   Murray  and   Barker  Neill.   6/2,   7/5,   6/2. 

Routledge,  — 30,  and  Bostwick,  — 15,  played  in  the  deciding  match  of 
the  handicap  sirlgles,  Routledge  winning  at  3/6,  6/3,  6/2.  In  the  doubles 
handicap  Bostwick  and  Holmes,  — 15-4,  won  from  E.  S.  Wills  and  H.  B. 
Routledge,  — 30.3.     The  score  was  6/0,   1/6,  6/2. 

The  ladies'  handicap  singles  went  to  Miss  Hawley,  and  the  mixed  handi- 
cap to  Miss  Ransome  and  Mr.  Hood.     They  played  from  scratch. 

MONTE    CARLO    TOURNAMENT. 

The  number  of  spectators  at  the  Monte  Carlo  Tournament  which  began 
February  21,  19 10,  was  not  as  large  as  in  former  years  owing  to  the 
absence  of  such  players  as  Alexander,  H.  L.  Doherty,  A.  F.  Wilding,  Gore 
and  Rahe,  among  the  men,  and  Miss  Eastlake  Smith,  now  Mrs.  Lamplough; 
Miss  Lowther,  Miss  Greene,  and  Countess  Schulenburg,  among  the  women. 

Doust,  the  Australian,  was  expected  by  many  to  defeat  Ritchie,  whose 
form  this  year  has  gone  off  pitiably,  but  he  had  only  just  arrived  and  was 
not  on  his  game,  Ritchie  winning  6/0,  6/4.  Decugis  had  no  difficulty  in 
disposing  of  H.   Kleinschroth,  6/2,  6/4. 

The  final  proved  to  be  a  procession,  Decugis  defeating  Ritchie,  6/3, 
6/0,    6/0. 

The  ladies'  open  singles  was  won  by  Miss  Salusbury. 

In  the  open  men's  doubles,  the  closest  match  was  between  Doust  and 
Wallis  Myers,  the  eventual  winners  of  the  event,  and  Bostwick  and  Holmes. 
Bostwick  and  Holmes  won  the  first  set  rather  easily  at  6/3,  and  leading 
at  4/3  in  the  second,  with  Holmes  to  serve.  LTnfortunately  for  them 
Holmes  became  very  unsteady  at  this  point  and  lost  four  of  his  services  in 
a  row.     Doust  and  Myers  won,  3/6,  6/4,  6/2. 

The  final  of  this  event  was  between  Doust  and  Myers  and  Decugis  and 
Ritchie,   the   former   pair   winning,    6/3,    6/3,   6/4. 

From  the  spectators'  standpoint  this  final  was  most  amusing  as  Ritchie 
was  so  out  of  form  he  could  not  score  a  point  from  any  part  of  the  court, 
with  the  result  that  Decugis  began  mixed  doubles  tactics  and  endeavored 
to  take  all  the  balls,  which  resulted  in  a  nurfiber  of  amusing  collisions,  one 
in  particular  being  an  absolute  clinch  with  arms  locked  on  the  prize  fight 
order,   which  drew  shouts  of  laughter  much  to  the   disgust  of   Ritchie. 

After  this  match  Decugis  went  right  on  with  his  wife,  who  has  improved 
considerably  in  two  years,  and  won  the  final  of  the  open  mixed  doubles 
against  E.  Gwynne  Evans  and  Miss   Salusbury,   8/6,   1/6,  6/1. 

The  class  A  handicap  singles  was  won  by  A.  Holmes.

Menton  Tennis  Club,  MarcTi   i,   19 10. 
First  round — Decugis  defeated  Blackwood  Price,  6/0,  6/0;  Ritchie  defeated

Alameda  County  (Gal.)  Championship.— This  event  was  held  in  May,  for 
the  first  time  in  the  Berkeley  courts.  It  had  formerly  been  held  in 
Alameda,  but  this  year  it  was  given  to  the  Berkeley  Club  in  order  that 
they  might  open  their  new  grounds  in  a  fitting  manner.  RIcLoughliu,  who 
is  a  star  at  all  times,  out-shone  himself  in  this  tournament.  He  played 
even  a  more  daring  game  than  usual,  with  few  errors.  This  is  the  game 
that  Carl  Gardner  ran  up  against  in  the  finals.  Although  playing  well 
himself,  he  had  little  chance  against  the  young  champion  that  day.  The 
greatest  upset  of  the  tournament  was  the  defeat  of  M.  H.  Long  by 
■George  Janes,  who  was  afterwards  beaten  by  Gardner,  The  doubles  were 
also  replete  with  good  matches  and  brilliant  playing.  In  the  final  James 
and  McLoughlin  again  met  and  defeattd  their  old  rivals,  Long  and 
Gardner,  in  the  hottest  and  best  match  of  the  whole  tournament,  making  a 
most  sensational  "pull  up."  The  summaries:  Preliminary  round — Herndon  d.

Allegheny  County  Cliampionships.— The  tournament  for  the  championship^ 
of  Allegheny  County,  Pennsylvania,  was  played  in  September  at  the  Pitts- 
burg Field  Club.  A  number  of  visiting  players,  including  F.  Geoghegan 
and  C.  S.  Karr  of  Washington,  competed,  and  the  event  was  in  every  re- 
spect successful.  P.  D.  Siverd  and  Dr.  T.  W.  Stephens  came  together  in 
the  singles  final  and  a  very  pretty  match  resulted.  Stephens  got  the  third 
set  at  7/5,  but  Siverd  won  the  other  three  sets  quite  easily.  The  former 
ci-eated  quite  a  sensation  by  defeating  Geoghegan  in  straight  sets  in  the 
semi-final,  but  the  Washingtonian  was  in  very  poor  form.  In  the  doubles. 
Siverd  and  T.  C.  Ward  outclassed  the  field,  losing  only  one  set,  and  that 
to  Guy  ton  and  Canfield  in  the  final  round.  The  summaries:  Singles:

Baltimore  C.  C.  Open  Tourney.— Basil  Wagner  vrarranted  the  prediction  that 
he  would  be  J.  A.  C.  Colston's  challenger  in  the  open  tournament  of  the- 
Baltimore  Country  Club,  which  began  June  7,  for  he  came  through  the  field 
with  but  one  lost  set,  and  that  in  the  final  round  against  H.  B.  Davis.  J. 
Kerr,  who  divided  the  honor  of  being  first  choice  with  Wagner,  met  the  latter 
in  the  semi-final  round.  Wagner  played  rings  around  Kerr,  however,  and  won 
at  6/2  and  6/3.  The  final  match  between  Wagner  and  Davis  was  a  fast  one. 
Davis  started  well  and  ran  out  the  opening  set  at  6/4.  Wagner  was  at  his 
heels,  however,  and  finally  broke  away  at  nine-all  in  the  second  set.  The 
third  set  was  another  nip-and-tuck  affair.  At  five-all  Davis  was  forced  to 
slow  down  and  Wagner  again  jumped  away.  The  fourth  and  last  set  was 
one-sided.  Davis  seemed  greatly  fatigued  and  made  a  half-hearted  defense, 
which  Wagner  foimd  easy  to  break  through.  "Cap"  Colston  and  Wagner  liad 
a  great  argument  in  the  challenge  round,  and  although  "Cap"  had  apiiar- 
ently  settled  the  matter  in  four  sets,  Wagner  braced  and  the  dispute  required 
five  sets  to  decide.  The  feature  of  their  meeting  was  Wagner's  great  pull-up 
in  the  fourth  set.  Colston,  with  two  sets  to  Wagner's  one.  was  leading  at 
5/1  and  40/30,  when  he  missed  a  soft  lob  which  he  should  have  killed.  Wag- 
ner won  that  game  and  five  more  before  Colston  braced  enoug'h  to  check  his 
rush.  The  fifth  set  was  easy  for  him,  for  Wagner  seemed  spent  and  weak 
after  his  efforts  in  the  previous  set.  The  final  doubles  found  A.  S.  Bowie 
and  F.  C.  Colston  on  one  side  of  the  net  and  "Cap"  Colston  and  Wagner  on 
the  other.  It  turned  out  to  be  a  very  close,  even  match,  but  Colston  and 
Bowie  drew  away  in  the  deciding  set.  when  the  score  stood  at  three-all.

Breakers  Tournament,  "Washington  State, — The  second  invitation  tourna- 
ment held  at  the  Breakers,  Breakers,  Wash.,  under  the  auspices  of  the 
Multnomah  Amateur  Athletic  Club  and  the  Irvington  Tennis  Club,  was 
an  even  greater  success  than  the  first  and  makes  a  fixture  of  one  of  the 
most  enjoyable  tournaments  on  the  coast.  The  majority  of  the  players 
are  from  Portland,  Ore.,  but  the  Calif  ornlans  who  play  in  the  North- 
west events  wind  up  with  the  Breakers.  Miss  Hotchkiss  won  the  ladies' 
event  in  1908,  and  L.  R.  Freeman  of  Pasadena,  Cal.,  took  the  scratch 
singles  in  that  year.  The  play  is  upon  two  board  courts,  which  are  kept  in 
good  condition  and  are  very  fast.  The  competition  is  keen  and  the  courts 
are  kept  busy  from  9  until  6,  while  the  whole  affair  takes  on  the  ap- 
pearance of  a  large  house  party  with  some  sort  of  a  function  each  evening. 
Usually  the  entries  number  from  thirty  to  forty  players.  J.  F.  Ewing 
won  the  scratch  singles  in  1909,  and  the  doubles  went  to  I.  Rohr  and  F.  H. 
V.  Andrews.  Miss  Elizabeth  Ryan  won  the  women's  singles,  and  the  handicap 
doubles  were  captured  by  Mrs.  Northrup  and  Mrs.  Leadbeller.  The  mixed 
was  won  by  Miss  Schaefer  and  E.  D.  Barrett. 

Bridgeport,  Conn.,  Tournament.— The  third  open  tournament  of  the 
Brooklawn  Country  Club,  Bridgeport,  Conn.,  was  won  by  F.  C.  Inman  of 
New  York.  It  was  one  of  the  season's  earliest,  beginning  on  May  25. 
P.  G.  Anderson,  twice  winner  of  the  handsome  challenge  cup,  was  Inman's 
opponent  in  the  final  round  and,  for  a  time,  more  than  held  his  own 
with  the  Metropolitan  title  holder.  It  was  a  gruelling  contest,  but  after 
dropping    the    fourth    set,    when    it   w^as    almost    won,    Anderson    was    unequal

to  the  strain  of  continuing,  and  made  little  eCfort  in  the  last  set,  which 
Inman  won  6/0.  Anderson  had  no  difficulty  in  reaching  the  final  round, 
but  R.  A.  Holden,  Jr.,  forced  Inman  to  the  limit  in  three  close  sets.  Four 
Yale  men  met  in  the  final  round  of  the  doubles,  but  Coleman  and  Evans

Central  Jersey  Championship. — Dr.  P.  B.  Hawk  regained  his  title  of  Central 
Jersey  champion  on  June  20,  when  he  defeated  Dean  Mathey  in  the  final 
round  of  the  tournament  played  at  the  Trenton  Country  Club.  Mathey  took 
the  title  in  1908,  but  Hawk  did  not  compete.  Hawk  won  his  matches  in 
straight  sets  until  he  met  Mathey.  The  latter  played  in  erratic  fashion  and 
Hawk's  steadiness  overwhelmed  him  in  the  first  two  sets.  In  the  third  set 
^^athey  played  brilliantly  and  Hawk's  efforts  netted  him  two  games.  The 
fourth  set  was  a  very  close  one,  but  at  five-all  Mathey  again  slumped  by  a 
number  of  bad  errors  and  Hawk  ran  out  the  match  with  carefully  placed 
drives  and  clever  volleys.  On  the  way  to  the  final  bracket  Mathey  had  two 
narrow  escapes.  The  first  was  from  A.  Bassford,  Jr.,  who  led  at  4/3  in  the 
odd  set,  and  the  second  from  R.  L.  James.  James  forced  the  score  to  five-all 
in  the  deciding  set.  Mathey  and  B.  M.  Dell  won  the  doubles,  but  had  a  hard 
time  disposing  of  Hawk  and  James  in  the  semi-final.  The  final  match,  how- 
ever, against  S.  Gordon  and  J.  Colburn  was  easy  for  the  Princeton  freshmen.

Championship  of  Allegheny  Mountains.  Play  for  the  championship  of  the 
Allegheny  Mountains  was  begun  on  August  24  at  the  Potomac  Club,  Cumber- 
land, Md..  aiMi  continued  throughout  the  week.  Quite  a  number  of  out-of- 
town  players  sent  in  their  entries  and  the  calibre  of  play  was  thus  ma- 
terially raised.  In  the  men's  singles  S.  Gordon  and  A.  J.  Colborn,  both, 
members    of   the   Princeton    team,    and    A.    H.    Boyd   and    C.    S.    Carr   filled    the

semi-final  brackets^.  Gordon  \von  easily  from  Boyd  in  two  6/3  sots,  but  Carr 
had  all  he  could  do  to  dispose  of  Colborn.  The  latter  had  a  big  lead  in  the 
deciding  set,  but  Carr  played  more  carefully  and  carried  off  the  set  6/4.  In 
the  tiual  round,  Gordon  played  splendidly.  Carr  was  outclassed  and  Gordon 
took  the  match  at  6/1,  6/0.  6/3.  TTie  challenge-  match  furnished  quite  a 
surprise,  for  it  was  confidently  expected  that  champion  F.  Geoghegan  would 
make  short  work  of  his  youthful  challenger.  The  prediction  was  true  for  the 
first  set,  but  the  remaining  three  were  greatly  in  favor  of  Gordon.  He 
played  steady  fast  tennis  and  showed  a  very  fair  knowledge  of  tactics.  He 
beat  Geoghegan  repeatedly  with  slow,  sharp  angled  drives  as  the  latter  ran 
in  and  his  lobs  were  remarkably  accurate  and  deep.  The  score  was  1/6,  6/1, 
6/2,  6/1.  Geoghegan  and  Carr  carried  off  the  doubles  and  Miss  Cochrane  and

of  R.  H.  Palmer  in  the  challenge  round  of  the  Chevy  Chase  tournament, 
played  at  the  Chevy  Chase  Club,  Washington,  D.  C.  Because  of  the  early 
date,  the  committee  failed  to  get  many  of  the  Eastern  cracks  that  were 
expected  to  take  part,  but  Doyle's  entry  saved  the  challenge  round  from 
what  might  otherwise  have  been  a  very  one-sided  affair.  A.  L.  Hoskins  was 
Doyle's  opponeiit  :n  the  final  round,  but  the  Philadelphian  was  outclassed. 
winning  just  five  gamj^s  in  the  three  sets.  The  challenge  match,  though  won 
in  straight  sets,  was  very  close.  Palmer's  drives  just  fell  short  of  equalling 
Doyle's  splendid  net  game,  but  the  Washingtonian  volleyed  for  aces,  more 
than  got  by  him.  Palmer  was  at  a  slight  disadvantage  on  the  wet  courts, 
but  Doyle  played  faultlessly  and  no  doubt  could  have  risen  to  whatever  the 
occasion  migat  have  demanded.  He  was  much  more  versatile  than  the 
Jersey  player,  who  persistently  played  from  the  back  court,  even  wiien  it 
was  obvious  that  to  do  so,  meant  defeat.  In  the  doubles  Doylp  was  again 
victorious,  when  paired  with  his  brother,  II.  E.,  he  successfully  defended 
ag-ainst  Palmer  and  L.  W.  Glazebrook.  In  that  match,  as  in  singles,  the 
challengers  were  .".gain  beaten  by  a  severe  net  attack,  both  Doyles  volleying 
magnificently  and  taking  the  net  even  on  their  opponent's  service.  "The

Coronado  Country  Club  (Cal.)  Tennis  Tournament.— The  fifth  annual 
tournament  of  the  Coronado  Country  Club,  held  on  the  club  courts,  which. 
began  on  February  18,  opened  the  tennis  season  iu  Southern  California 
for  1909.  The  ideal  climatic  conditions  at  Coronado  make  an  out-door 
tennis  tournament  at  this  seaon  of  the  year  possible.  The  chief  attraction 
to  this  year's  tournament  was  the  presence  of  the  San  Francisco  stars,. 
Miss  Hazel  Hotchkiss,  Maurice  E.  McLoughlin  and  Carl  R.  Gardner. 
Southern  California  was  well  represented  in  the  ladles  events  by  the 
three  Sutton  sisters  and  MVs.  Robert  Farquhar  (nee  Marion  Jones),  but 
was  not  so  well  represented  in  the  men's  events,  as  Messrs.  Bell,  Braly 
and  Browne,  three  of  their  strongest  players,  were  unable  to  attend.  In 
the  men's  singles  it  was  generally  conceded  that  McLoughlin  would  win 
the  tournament,  which  he  did,  defeating  his  San  Francisco  team-ma"te,

.Southern  tennis  centers  when  Louisville  gave  a  tournament  for  the  champion- 
ship of  the  Falls  Cities  beginning  July  3.  G.  B.  Eager,  a  youngster  hitherto 
not  even  seriously  considered,  upset  several  local  cracks  and  capped  the 
climax  by  winning  from  R.  Barfield  in  the  final  round.  Barfield  was  thought 
to  be  a  much  stronger  player.  The  challenge  match  brimmed  with  exciting 
tennis.  It  required  five  long  sets  lasting  over  three  hours.  G.  Vaughan,  the 
holder,  was  finally  bested  by  a  wonderful  exhibition  of  grit  and  cleverness.

games  and  finally  the  set  at  8/6.  This  discouraging  defeat  was  modified  for

Evans  of  Birmingham,  Ala.  The  mixed  doubles  were  won  by  W.  B. 
Cragin,  Jr.,  and  Miss  Turle.  The  numerous  entertainments  given  during  the 
week  provided  a  rattling  good  time  for  the  visitors,  all  of  whom  were  loud 
in  their  praises  of  Southern  hospitality,  and  an  even  larger  tournament  is 
expected  this  year.  The  winners:  Men's  singles — Preliminary  round:  J.  B.

Lake  Georgre  Championship.— The  Sagamore  Hotel  courts  were  the  scene  on 
September  6  of  the  commencement  of  the  fourth  annual  Lake  George  cham- 
pionship. The  entry  was  a  higher  class  one  than  in  previous  meetings,  but 
fell  off  in  point  of  size.  The  playing  conditions  were  ideal  through  the 
week  and  the  courts  were  in  splendid  shape.  In  the  men's  events,  G.  C. 
Shafer  and  S.  B.  Smith,  last  year's  runner-up,  came  through  their  respective 
sides.  They  had  a  long  five-set  match  in  the  final,  which  finally  was  won 
by  Shafer.  principally  because  of  his  greater  stamina.  The  scoro  was  6/3, 
4/6,  3/6.  6/0.  10/8.  G.  C.  and  E.  H.  Shafer  won  the  doubles,  but  C.  W. 
MacMullen  and  R.  D.  Loines  gave  them  a  hard  tussle  in  the  second  round. 
Miss  S.  Lewis  won  the  women's  singles.  She  had  a  very  hard  match  with 
Miss  Turle.  but  Miss  Simpson  was  easy  for  her  in  the  final.  Miss  Turle

Lawn  Tennis  in  Detroit. — Tennis  conditions  in  Detroit  during  1909  were 
unquestionably  more  favorable  than  ever  before,  and  all  indications  point  to 
a  steadily  increasing  popularity  for  the  game  in  the  seasons  to  come.  While 
to  many  enthusiasts  the  growth  has  seemed  slow,  yet  even  these  must  admit 
that  it  has  been  sure.  During  1909  there  was  no  great  forward  movement, 
but  there  were  a  number  of  encouraging  signs.  One  of  these  was  the 
flourishing  season  enjoyed  by  the  new  Detroit  Tennis  Club,  in  the  North  End. 
This  organization,  while  not  numbering  many  of  the  city's  first-rank  players 
among  its  members,  has  shown  the  right  spirit  in  .encouraging  the  novices, 
and  it  v/ould  not  be  surprising  if  in  a  few  seasons  it  were  able  to  meet  any 
of  the  older  organizations  on  even  terms.  The  club's  1909  tournament  was 
very  successful.  The  whinner  was  Frank  Atkinson,  who  defeated  Mvers  in 
the  final  match,  by  6/3,  4/6.  6/2,  6/2.  The  doubles  were  won  by  Messrs. 
Atkinson  and  Spicer.  The  Detroit  Athletic  Club  tennis  men,  as  usual,  were 
the  "class"  of  the  city's  players,  including  Harry  Stevens,  Walter  McNeil, 
Frank  Atkinson,  L.  Hibbard.  Percy  Donovan,  Earl  Drake  and  Ross  H. 
Holmes,  Jr.— by  far  the  strongest  aggregation  in  this  vicinity  if  not  in  the 
state.  The  D.  A.  C.  contingent  had  a  good  season  from  every  standpoint. 
Ifs  members  performed  well  in  tournament  play,  and  there  was  great  activity 
on  the  club  courts  during  a  large  portion  of  the  season.  The  six  courts  were 
kept  in  good  condition  from  early  spring,  and  the  club  officials  showed  a 
disposition  to  co-operate  with  the  racquet-wielders  in  every  way.  The 
tennis  committee  was  active  and  efficient  throughout.  The  D.  A.  C.  held  no 
club  tournament,  but  most  of  its  tennis  stars  competed  in  the  state  tourna- 
ment, so  that  their  relative  standing  may  be  pretty  accurately  determined.  At 
the  Country  Club  of  Detroit  at  Grosse  Pointe  more  tennis  was  played  than  ever 
before,  the  six  courts  being  in  almost  constant  use.  The  game  vied  in 
popularity  with  golf,  formerly  the  big  summer  favorite,  and  so  far  as  the 
younger  people  were  concerned,  had  a  lead  over  the  rival  game.  Without 
doubt,    interest    in   tennis    at    the    Country    Club    has   grown    so    notablv   during 


176  SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

the  past  two  or  three  seasons  because  of  the  presence  of  a  professional, 
George  Healey.  who  holds  a  position  comparable  to  that  of  the  club's  golf 
"pro."     Thus  those  who  begin  the  game  are  taught  to  play  it  correctly. 

Long  Island  Championship.— On  May  29,  W.  B.  Cragiu,  Jr.,  through  the  de- 
fault of  F.  B.  Alexander,  became  Long  Island  champion.  The  tournament, 
which  was  held  on  the  Kings  County  Club's  courts  of  Brooklyn,  was  most 
unsatisfactory,  due  to  bad  weather  condition  and  a  conflicting  event  in  New 
York  City.  H.  J.  MoUenhauer  and  H.  L.  Westfall  met  in  the  second  round, 
but  the  latter  was  extremely  erratic,  and  MoUenhauer  won  in  two  6/4  sets. 
Cragin  defeated  H.  C.  Martin  in  a  good  three-set  match,  and  J.  T.  McMiahou 
proved  too  clever  for  Sam  Westfall.  In  the  semi-finals,  MoUenhauer  led  H. 
L.  Roberts  throughout  their  match,  and  Cragin's  consistent  gets  and  dis- 
couragingly  steady  game  upset  McM'ahon  completely.  He  was  able  to  win 
but  three  games.  The  final,  contrary  to  all  expectations,  resulted  in  a  four- 
set  victory  for  Cragin.  Tlie  latter  played  as  always— steady,  hitting  easy, 
high  drives  and  invariably  waiting  for  an  opening,  or  his  opponent  to  miss. 
He  rarely,  if  ever,  took  a  chance  of  an  error,  and  his  patience  was  amply 
rewarded.  MoUenhauer  played  in  streaks,  one  minute  really  fine  tennis  and 
the  next  with  absurd  mistakes.  He  won  the  second  set  6/1  by  brilliant  all- 
round  play,  but  he  fell  off  then  and  Cragin  put  the  balls  constantly  back  for 
him  to  ultimately  misplay.  C.  M.  Bull,  Jr.  and  Martin  proved  the  best  of 
the  doubles  teams  and,  after  a  match  with  MoUenhauer  and  McMlahon,  the 
first  part  of  which  was  extremely  close,  won  the  tournament.  The  sum-

Madisonville  (Ohio)  Tennis  Club.— This  club  was  organized  with  sixteen 
charter  members  in  October.  1908,  and  immediately  laid  out  three  courts  and 
erected  a  club  house  with  reception  rooms,  etc.  It  has  a  large  porch  over- 
looking the  three  courts  which  are  entirely  surrounded  with  eleven-foot  back- 
stops. They  have  ground  suflicient  to  build  five  more  courts  and  intend  to 
erect  an  additional  one  this  winter,  as  their  membership  has  increased  so 
rapidly  that  the  three  are  not  suflicient  to  accommodate  the  players.  They 
closed  the  season  with  sixty-six  members,  forty-six  of  whom  were  men  and 
twenty  women.  Two  tournaments  were  held  during  the  past  season,  but  they 
were  not  of  much  importance,  only  giving  an  idea  of  the  playing  ability 
of  the  various  members.  The  club  was  formed  through  the  consolidation 
of   several   private  courts,    and   the   result   has  been   most   gratifying.

Narragansett  Pier  Tournament.— The  Narragansett  Pier  tournament,  which 
was  held  at  the  Point  Judith  Country  Club  on  September  1.  attracted  an 
unusually  large  and  high  class  entry.  J.  O.  Ames  and  F.  C.  Inman  came 
through  their  respective  sides  of  the  draw  and  their  match  in  the  final  was 
an  excellent  one.  Ames  was  remarkably  steady  and  quite  aggressive,  but  he 
lacked  the  bursts  of  speed  and  sudden  swift  attacks  that  characterized 
Inman's  game.  The  latter  was  no  less  steady  than  his  Providence  opponent 
and  his  consistency,  combined  with  repeated  brilliant  streaks,  proved  too 
difficult  a  problem  for  Ames.  Mrs.  Green  and  D.  Campbell  defeated  Mss 
Sturgess  and  R.  Hazard.  Jr.,  in  two  easy  sets  in  the  final  of  the  mixed

New  England  Intercollegiate  Championship. — While  Dartmouth  won  the  New 
England  intercollegiate  tournament  at  Longwood,  May  24  to  27,  F.  H,  Harris 
upset  calculations,  defeating  S.  B.  Smith,  1908  champion,  in  singles.  Beforo 
this  tournament  the  score  of  the  leading  teams  for  the  challenge  bowl  stood: 
Williams  6  1-2,  Tech.  6,  and  Dartmouth  3  1-2.  A  first  in  each  event  counts  1 
point,  while  the  runner-up  gets  1-2,  so  Dartmouth,  by  winning  two  firsts  and 
a  second,  evened  up  with  M.  I.  T.  and  within  a  hairsbreadth  of  the  leaders. 
The  cup  will  be  won  by  the  college  first  scoring  8  points,  and  ail  three  of 
the  Green's  champion  team  will  be  eligible  next  season.  Capt.  S.  B.  Smith 
'10,  his  partner  in  doubles,  H.  A,  Wolff  '10,  and  F,  H.  Harris  '11  are  easily 
the  best  balanced  team  among  the  smaller  colleges,  and  each  a  player  with 
possibilities.  Representatives  were  entered  from  Dartmouth,  Tech,  Williams, 
Amherst,  Bowdoin,  Bro'vn,  Wesleyan,  Vermont  and  Trinity,  the  two  leading 
players  being  sent  from  each  college.  In  the  semi-final  round  of  the  singles,

New  Haven  Lawn  Tennis  Club  Tournament.— Two  old  rivals  faced  each 
other  when  G.  H.  Nettletou  met  H.  L.  Westfall  in  the  challenge  roupd  of 
the  New  Haven  Lawn  Tennis  Club's  tournament  which  began  June  21.  Net- 
tleton  had  come  through  the  tournament  meeting  Avith  little  opposition  \intil 
the  final  round,  when  R.  A.  Holden.  Jr..  went  down  after  five  fast  sets. 
Holden  played  remarkably  well  but  Nettleton  was  in  rare  form  and  the  fifth 
set  required  just  six  games  to  decide.  Holden  surprised  the  spectators  on  the 
previous  day  when  he  won  from  Neal  Stevens.  Stevens  was  conceded  an 
excellent  chance  to  win  the  tournament  but  Holden's  great  accuracy  and 
caution  served  him  in  good  stead  and  the  match  went  to  him  by  the  very 
narrow  margin  of  2/6.  6/4,  and  12/10.  The  challenge  match  resulted  in 
an  unlooked-for  triumph  for  Nettleton.  For  three  sets  honors  were  very 
even  but  the  loss  of  the  third  seemed  to  unnerve  Westfall  completely  and 
in  the  fourth  and  last  set,  he  failed  to  score  a  game.  Nettleton  played 
more  aggressively  than  is  his  custom,  and  was  very  steady.  Westfall  on 
the  other  hand,  alternated  from  good  to  bad,  and  tiefore  the  match  ended 
was  playing  Nettleton's  own  game  of  soft  hitting.  Stevens  and  H.  H.  Bundy 
won  the  doubles,  winning  the"  final  round  from  R.  A.  Holden.  Jr.,  and  T.  W. 
Farnum.  The  summaries:  Men's  singles:  First  round — W.  McK.  Dunn

Nyack  Tournament.— R.  C.  Seaver  made  a  successful  attempt  to  carry 
off  honors  of  the  Nyack  Country  Club's  annual  tournament.  A  big  and 
classy  field  was  on  hand  when  play  began  on  August  30.  The  early  rounds 
were  replete  with  interesting  matches.  Dr.  W.  Rosenbaum  Avas  almost 
beaten  by  E.  Fincke,  and  S.  H.  Voshell  ended  W.  C.  Grant's  aspirations 
in  a  fast  three-set  match.  L.  Perry  outclassed  Rosenbaum  in  the  fourth 
round,  but  in  the  semi-final  was  outplayed  by  Seaver.  Mollenhauer  and 
Voshell  met,  but  the  Kings  County  man  beat  Voshell  easily.  The  final 
round  was  all  in  favor  of  Seaver.  Mollenhauer  was  very  wild.  Only  in 
the  second  set,  which  he  won  at  6/3.  did  he  strike  his  gait,  and  Seaver's 
steady  driving  won  the  other  three  sets  for  the  Bostonian  at  6/1,  6/2,  6/1. 
The  doubles  furnished  quite  a  surprise  in  the  final  round.  iPollenhauer 
and  J.  T.  McMahon  faced  Grant  and  Rosenbaum.  The  Brooklyn  team 
seemed  the  stronger,  but  Rosenbaum,  at  whom  they  directed  their  attack, 
played     very     well.      He    was    deadly    overhead    and     steady     with    all    his

tournament  of  the  Ocean  Park  Country  Club  began.  While  perhaps  the  chief 
interest  of  both  players  aud  spectators  was  in  the  outcome  of  the  doubles,

Ohio  Intercollegiate  Tennis  Championship.— The  first  Ohio  Intercollegiate 
Tennis  Tournament,  other  than  dual  meets  on  record,  was  held  Juue  3-5  in 
Gambler,  Ohio,  the  seat  of  Kcnyon  College.  Owing  to  inclement  weather  the 
entries  were  reduced  to  three— Ohio  Wesleyan  University,  Case  School  of 
Applied  Science  and  Kenyon"  College,  yet  the  matches  proved  most  interest- 
ing.     Frederick    W.    Carr,    Western    intercollegiate    champion    in    1907,    who 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  183 

attended  Kenyon  College  in  the  years  1908-1909,  was  an  easy  winner  in  the 
singles,  playing  the  tournament  through  without  the  loss  of  a  set.  Bare 
and  Rockey,  of  Ohio  Wesleyan,  were  victorious  in  the  doubles.  As  this  waa 
the  first  tournament,  cups  were  not  given  as  prizes,  but  through  the  courtesy 
of  A.  G.  Spalding  and  Brothers,  racquets  were  presented  to  the  winners. 
While  the  tournament  was  in  progress,  a  permanent  organization  was  formed 
Ijnowu  as  the  "Ohio  Intercollegiate  Trnnis  Association,"  and  a  Constitution 
drawn  up  providing  for  a  yearly  tournament  to  be  played  in  the  spring 
between  the  colleges  of  the  Ohio  Athletic  Conference.  The  1910  tournament 
will  be  held  on  the  courts  of  Case  School  in  Cleveland. 

Ojai  Valley  Tennis  Tournament.— The  fourteenth  annual  tennis  tourna- 
ment of  the  Ojai  Valley  Tennis  Club  was  held  on  their  six  courts  at 
Nordhoff,  Cal.,  on  April  1,  2  and  3.  For  the  third  time,  M'iss  Elizabeth 
Ryan  won  the  girl's  interscholastic  event  for  Marlborough  School,  Los 
Angeles;  also  winning  the  girls'  interscholastic  doubles  with  Miss  Freese 
(also  of  M'arlborough)  as  a  partner.  Ward  Dawson,  representing  Los 
Angeles  High  School,  won  the  interscholatic  event  for  ooys,  defeating  in 
the  finals  Charles  Rogers,  also  of  L.  A.  High  School.  With  Rogers  as  a 
partner  Dawson  captured  the  doubles  event.  The  ladies'  open  event 
was  won  by  Miss  Hazel  HotcL.iiss  of  Berkeley,  Cal.,  in  rather  easy 
fashion.  In  the  absence  of  the  Sutton  sisters,  the  only  real  opponents 
Miss  Hotehkiss  encountered  were  Mrs.  Robert  Farquhar  and  Miss  Ryan. 
Both  these  matches  were  very  interesting,  but  Miss  Hotehkiss  won  by 
a  safe  margin.  The  men's  open  singles  was  won  by  Tom  Bundy  of  Los 
Angeles,  who  defeated  Maurice  McLoughlin  in  the  semi-finals  and  Carl 
Gardner  in  th.e  finals.  Bell  and  Bundy  showed  very  good  form  throughout 
the  men's  open  doubles,  and  won  their  way  to  the  finals  without  much 
trouble.  In  the  finals  they  were  opposed  by  M'.  E.  McLoughlin  and  Albert 
T.  Spauldiug,  and  a  great  fight  resulted,  which  was  finally  won  by 
Bell  and  Bundy  of  Southern  California  in  a  close  three-set  match.  The 
mixed  doubles  were  won  by  Miss  Hotehkiss  and  M'cLoughlin,  of  San 
B'rancisco,  and  the  ladies'  doubles,  by  Mrs.  Farquhar  and  Miss  Ryan  of 
Los  Angeles.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  tournament,  W.  L.  Thacher,  the 
old  Yale  player,  presented  the  trophies  and  prizes,  and  in  the  evening 
the  contestants  participated  in  a  dance  held  at  the  Thacher  School.

Philadelphia  and  District  Championships.— A  week  subsequent  to  the  inter- 
national matches  at  Manheim,  the  Ehiladelphia  and  District  Championships 
were  decided  at  the  Belmont  Cricket  Club.  The  entry  was  unusually  strong, 
and,  while  he  did  not  play,  the  name  of  W.  C.  Crawley  of  the  English  team 
on  the  list,  proved  a  great  drawing  card  up  to  the  time  of  his  default.  The 
surprise  of  the  meeting  came  when  H.  Y.  Lake,  a  local  man,  put  W.  F. 
Johnson  out  of  the  running.  Johnson  seemed  stale  and  played  a  listless  game 
but  Lake  played  fast,  steady  teunis.  Two  rounds  later  Lake  met  his  master 
in  C.  M.  Bull,  Jr.,  of  New  York.  The  final  round  was  played  between  Bull 
and  H.  J.  Rendall.  It  was  a  fast  fairly  even  contest.  Bull  played  remark- 
ably in  the  second  set  in  which  Rendall  scored  just  one  game,  but  he  fell 
off  quickly  in  the  third.  He  was  quite  erratic  and  his  efforts  to  overcome  it 
by  soft  hitting  proved  useless  against  Rendall's  clever  net  work  and  sharp 
drives.  In  the  challenge  round  Rendall  and  J.  R.  Carpenter,  Jr.,  were  very 
evenly  matched.  Both  were  unsteady  but  Rendall  was  better  able  to  come 
round  when  the  spore  became  too  close.  He  won  in  four  sets.  The  doubles 
almost  terminated  in  an  upset  of  unusual  degree.  Rendall  and  R.  L.  James 
won  this  event,  but  A.  P.  Simmons  and  C.  S.  Rogers  gave  them  a  great 
fight.  They  won  the  first  set  and  forced  the  other  three  to  deuce.  It  was 
a  great  surprise,  for  Simmons  and  Rogers  were  thought  to  be  completely 
outclassed.  Miss  A.  E.  .Wallace  won  the  women's  singles  and  Miss  ^L  Sayres 
and  A.   Thayer,  the  mixed  doubles.

the  courts  of  the  Alpena  Country  Club.  July  15,  16  and  17,  attracted  a 
fine  entry  list,  and  produced  seme  of  the  best  tennis  ever  seen  in  the 
State.  Frank  Atkinson,  of  Detroit,  won  the  finals  from  Paul  Leidy,  of 
Toledo,  in  a  fine  contest.  The  challenge  round  for  the  Alpena  Country 
Club  trophy,  with  Atkinson,  challenger,  vs.  Henry  G.  Stevens,  holder, 
was  a  gruelling  contest.  Stevens  won  the  first  two  sets  handily,  Atkinson 
taking  the  third  and  fourth  sets  13/11  and  6/3.  At  this  point,  Stevens 
braced  and  took  the  deciding  set  6/3.  This  gives  Stevens  a  second  leg

SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL.  185 

San  Francisco  City  Championship.— This  event  was  held  on  May  31,  at 
the  California  Lawn  Tennis  Club.  Maurice  McLoughlin  successfully 
defended  his  title  agiinst  MeJville  Long,  thereby  becoming  permanent 
possessor  of  the  handsome  Grant  trophy.  Long  worked  his  way  to  the 
finals  by  defeating  Charles  Foley,  Ralph  Gorrill,  E.  P.  Finigan  and 
George  Janes.  Janes  had  previously  won  his  way  to  the  semi-finals,  where 
he  defeated  C.  R.  Gardner  in  a  three-set  match.  The  challenge  match 
attracted  considerable  attention,  as  it  brought  McLoughlin  and  Long 
together  for  the  first  time  in  tournament  since  September,  1908,  at  which 
time  Long  was  victorious.  McLoughlin  was  expected  to  get  revenge,  and 
the  spectators  looked  forward  to  a  rare  treat.  As  often  happens  in  such 
cases,  neither  player  put  up  as  good  a  game  as  he  was  capable  of  playing. 
Long  got  a  most  ridiculous  streak  of  double-faulting,  making  twenty-one 
doubles  in  three  sets.  His  driving  and  net  work,  however,  were  brilliant, 
while  McLoughlin,  on  the  contrary,  did  not  play  quite  as  well  on  ground 
strokes,  but  his  service  was  very  good.  The  score  of  this  match  was 
6/4,  9/7,  7/5.  Preliminary  round— C.  Curley  defeated  R.  Strachan,  by 
default;  R.  Gorrill  d.  N.  Ambrose,  6/2.  8/6;  G.  Janes  d.  E.  Fottrell,  8/6,

Sippican  Open  Tournament.  Unusual  interest  was  manifested  in  the  Sippican 
Club's  annual  tournament  played  at  M'arion,  Mass.,  and  the  list  of  com- 
petitors was  nearly  twice  as  large  as  it  had  ever  been  in  past  years.  Many 
prominent  Boston  players  entered  but  keen  enthusiasm  marked  the  appear- 
ance of  the  veteran  doubles  ex-champion,  Dwight  F.  Davis.  Play  began  on 
September  3  and  ended  four  days  later.  In  marked  contrast  to  the  rather 
poor  form  Davis  exhibited  at  Lougwood.  was  his  playing  in  this  meeting. 
In  the  semi-final  round  he  met  E.  Tudor  Gross  and  beat  him  in  a  fast, 
three-set  match.  In  the  final  he  played  a  splendid  game  against  H.  I. 
Foster  of  Boston.  As  clever  as  he  is,  Foster  was  outclassed  and  Davis  won 
at  6/3,  6/1,  6/2.  The  old  timer's  famous  smashing  and  terrific  ground 
strokes  came  off  beautifully  and  only  in  court  covering  did  he  seem  below 
his  standard  of  several  years  ago.  His  service,  wath  its  fast  break  and 
high  bound,  was  as  good  as  ever.  No  player  ever  had  a  more  deadly  delivery. 
A  big  surprise  was  created  in  the  doubles  by  the  Leonard  brothers,  C.  R. 
and  R.  They  had  not  been  very  seriously  considered  until  their  defeat  of 
McKinney  and  Gross,  but  that  victory  was  dimmed  by  their  triumph  in  the 
final  round  over  H.  C.  Johnson  and  H.  I.  Foster.  Both  brothers  were 
remarkably  steady  and  were  miles  ahead  of  any  one  entered  when  it  came  to 
covering  the  court.  Foster  and  Johnson  won  the  second  set  at  love  but  the 
Harvard  men  won  the  next  two  by  a  margin  that  left  no  room  for  doubt 
as  to  their  superior  abilitv.  The  summaries:  Singles:  First  round — H.  H.

vived for  the  final  round.  Owing  to  slippery  courts  and  generally  unfavor-

championship,  defeating  L.  Bragg,  Evanston  Academy,  in  the  finals,  6/4,  6/3,

"Western  New  York  Tennis  Championship,  1909.— The  ninth  annual  tourna- 
ment for  the  championships  of  western  New  York,  held  for  the  first  time 
under  the  auspices  of  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association, 
at  the  courts  of  the  Park  Club.  Buffalo.  N.  Y.,  started  August  31  and  was 
finished  on  the  following  Monday.  Previously,  this  tournament  has  been,  for 
the  most  part,  confined  to  entries  from  Buffalo,  but  this  year  Miss  May 
Sutton  of  California,  Miss  Edith  Rotch  of  Boston,  and  Miss  Lois  Moyes  of 
Toronto  entered  in  the  ladies'  singles  and  mixed  doubles,  and  Beals  C. 
Wright  of  Boston,  Wallace  F.  Johnson  of  Philadelphia,  John  C.  Neely  of 
Chicago,  Robert  Baird  of  Toronto,  and  C.  J.  Bridgers  of  North  Carolina  were 
entered  in  the  men's  events.  The  entry  was  a  record-breaker  for  this  tourna- 
ment, there  being  forty-three  in  the  men's  singles,  twenty  teams  in  men's 
doubles  and  sixteen  in  the  ladies'  open  singles.  The  first  surprise  of  the 
tournament  came  in  the  second  round,  when  Gilbert,  a  local  man  playing  in 
his  first  tournament,  defeated  Neely  of  Chicago.  Neely,  who  has  played 
almost  exclusively  on  grass,  was  bothered  by  the  high  bound  and  the  light- 
ness of  the  balls  on  clay.  In  the  upper  half  Baird.  the  Toronto  city  cham- 
pion,   met    little    opposition    until    he    met    Hodge,    an    ex-western    New    York 


SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL.  191 

champion,  in  the  semi-finals.  Baird  was  very  wild  in  the  first  set,  while 
Hodge,  playing  steadily  and,  at  times,  brilliantly,  had  little  difficulty 
in  winning  'the  first  set,  6/1.  Bard  then  braced  up  and  ran  out  the  match, 
€/l,  6/3.  In  the  lower  half,  after  the  Morey-Johnson  match,  Johnson 
found  little  to  bother  him  until  he  met  Kirkover  in  the  second  round. 
Both  players,  confined  themselves  exclusively  to  a  chop  stroke.  Kirkover,  by 
his  steadiness  and  his  great  getting  ability,  forced  the  first  set  to  deuce  and 
the  last  one  to  6/4,  but  was  unable  to  get  a  set,  Johnson  winning,  7/5.  6/4. 
The  finals  on  Labor  Day,  played  before  a  gallery  of  700  or  800  people,  brought 
Baird  and  Johnson  together.  Baird  was  unsteady  in  the  first  set.  He 
improved  considerably  in  the  second,  but  Johnson,  by  playing  the  ball  at  his 
feet  as  he  came  to  the  net,  had  little  difficulty  in  taking  this  set.  In  the 
third,  however,  Baird  found  himself,  and  by  brilliant  volleying  at  the  net, 
won  at  6/3.  He  continued  to  play  well  in  the  fourth  set  also,  but  Johnson 
was  not  to  be  denied,  and,  leading  at  all  stages,  won  at  6/3.  In  the  men's 
doubles,  Beals  Wright  and  Johnson  lost  but  few  games  until  they  met  Neely 
and  Baird  in  the  upper  semi-final  bracket.  Wright  and  Johnson  won  the 
first  set,  6/4.  and  led  in  the  second  at  5/3.  Neely  and  Baird  pulled  the 
games  to  5-all.  but  lost  the  set,  7/5.  In  the  lower  half,  where  most  of  the 
leading  local  players  were  engaged,  Richards  and  Sicard  unexpectedly  won 
from  Hodge  and  Morey.  Bridgers  paired  with  a  young  local  player,  Don 
Carroll,  put  out  the  present  city  champions,  Bissell  and  MV^Laughlin,  and 
then  they  were  put  out  in  the  semi-final  by  Richard  and  Sicard.  In  the 
final  Richard  and  Sicard  were  ahead  at  one  stage  in  each  of  the  first  two 
sets,  but  did  not  succeed  in  taking  a  set  from  their  opiiouents,  Wright  and 
Johnson  winning.  6/3,  6/4,  6/1.  In  the  ladies'  singles  Miss  Moyes  met  Miss 
Rotch  in  the  semi-finals  in  the  upper  half.  Tlie  play  was  very  close,  but 
Miss  Rotch  by  her  greater  steadiness  at  all  times,  safely  held  the  lead, 
winning  6/3.  6/3.  In  the  lower  half  the  only  player  who  succeeded  in  taking 
any  games  from  Miss  Sutton  was  Mrs.  Harvey,  the  present  city  champion, 
she  winning  two  games  in  the  first  set  and  one  in  the  second.  In  the  final 
round  Miss  Rotch  also  succeeded  in  winning  three  games.  Miss  Clarke,  the 
defender  in  this  event,  was  unable  to  get  a  game  from  Miss  Sutton.  M'any 
games  went  to  deuce,  however,  but  Miss  Sutton  was  at  her  best,  her  strokes 
having  great  power,  while  errors  were  extremely  few.  In  the  mixed 
doubles.  Miss  Rotch  and  Beals  Wright  defeated  Miss  Moyes  and  Johnson  in 
the  upper  semi-final  bracket  after  losing  the  first  set,  2/6,  and  pulling  up  to 
5-all  after  their  opponents  had  a  comfortable  lead  in  the  second.  The  finals 
brought  Miss  Sutton  and  Kirkover  against  Miss  Rotch  and  Wright.  It  was 
expected  that  the  match  would  be  very  close,  but  Miss  Sutton  and  Kirkover 
had  little  difficulty  in  winning.  6/3.  6/2.  Men's  singles:  Preliminary  round —

The  Annual  Meeting  and  Election. 

On  February  4,  1910,  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Asso- 
ciation held  its  annual  meeting  at  the  Waldorf-Astoria,  New  York  City. 
The  attendance  of  delegates  from  the  different  clubs  was  unusually 
large,  although,  as  usual,  votes  by  proxy  figured  largely  in  the  matters 
brought  up. 

After  the  election  of  officers,  which,  with  one  exception,  was  a  re-election 
of  1909  officials,  several  topics  of  importance  were  taken  up  and  acted 
upon.  The  single  change  referred  to  was  the  voluntary  retirement  of 
Dwight  F.  Davis  from  the  Executive  Committee  and  the  substitution  of 
Dr.    P.    B.   Hawk. 

The  subject  of  most  vital  interest  was  the  proposed  creation  of  a  National 
Clay  Court  Championship.  Contrary  to  expectations,  the  fight  predicted 
over  its  inauguration  did  not  materialize,  and  after  addresses  by  Butler 
Lamb  of  North  Dakota  and  J.  T.  Bailey  of  Oklahoma,  championing  the  prop- 
osition, it  was  decided  to  hold  it  for  one  season  at  least,  and  give  it  a  trial. 
The  Omaha  Field  Club  of  Omaha,  Neb.,  made  the  successful  bid  tor  the 
event,  which  will  be  called  the  Clay  Court  Championship  of  the  United 
States. 

.    Several    new    clubs   were   admitted   to   the   Association,   and   among    other 
things   it   was  decided   to   challenge   again    for   the  Davis    Cup. 

The  ranking  was  passed  upon  finally  and  a  suggestion  made  to  improve 
the  representation  in  the  Association  of  clubs.  The  matter  was  put  over, 
however,    for   another  meeting.

Constitution 


ARTICLE    I. 

NAME. 

This  organization  shall  be  known  as  the  "United  States  National 
Lawn  Tennis  Association." 

ARTICLE    II. 

MEMBERS. 

Section  1.     There  shall  be  two  classes  of  members  : 

1.  Clubs. 

2.  Associations  of  Clubs. 

Sect.  2.  An  association  of  clubs  shall  consist  of  five  or  more  indi- 
vidual clubs,  any  one  of  which  may,  or  may  not,  be  itself  a  member 
of  the  National  Association.  But  no  club  shall  otherwise  be  a  member 
of  more  than  one  association. 

Sect.  S.  Every  such  association  shall  represent  either  a  stated 
section  of  the  country,  or  a  stated  number  of  schools  and  colleges,  and 
in  each  case  its  stated  limits  shall  necessarily  exclude  to  that  extent 
the  stated  limits  of  every  other  association. 

Sect.  4.  Propositions  for  Membership.— Proi)ositions  for  member- 
ship must  be  made  in  writing  to  the  Executive  Committee,  hereinafter 
provided  for,  with  the  name  and  address  of  the  applicant,  and  signed  by 
the  Secretary  of  the  club  or  association  making  the  proposal.  Where 
the  applicant  is  an  association,  the  names  and  addresses  of  each  of  its 
members  shall  be  given  with  the  application,  together  with  a  state- 
ment of  the  limits  that  it  desires  to  represent  :  and  thereafter  such 
association,  if  elected,  shall  notify  the  Secretary  of  the  National 
Association  of  any  changes  in  its  membership  immediately  upon 
occurrence. 

Sect.  5.  The  Executive  Committee  shall  have  full  power  to  pass 
upon  candidates  for  membership  without  a  general  election,  except 
that  no  association  shall  be  deemed  a  member  whose  limits  shall  con- 
flict with  those  of  other  associations  until  its  admittance  be  confirmed 
by  a  two-thirds'  vote  at  the  annual  meeting  of  the  National  Associa- 
tion, or  by  the  consent  of  the  association  upon  whose  limits  it  en- 
croaches. '  The  admittance  to  membership  of  such  an  association 
necessarily  decreases  the  limits  of  other  associations  to  such  an  extent 
as  shall  preclude  a  conflict  of  limits. 

Sect.  6.  Dues,  eta. — The  annual  dues  to  this  Association,  in  the 
case  of  clubs,  shall  be  seven  dollars  (.$7),  and,  in  the  case  of  associa- 
tions of  clubs,  shall  be  twenty-five  dollars  ($25),  except  that,  where 
any  association  is  composed  of  more  than  ten  clubs,  its  annual  dues 
shall,  in  addition,  be  ten  dollars  ($10)  for  every  five  clubs  or  fraction 
thereof  members  of  it  so  additional.  No  club  or  assocation  shall  be 
allowed  the  privileges  of  a  membei'  until  its  first  annual  dues  have 
been  paid.  All  dues  for  the  ensuing  year  shall  be  payable  at  the 
annual  meeting. 

Sect.  7.  Limits  of  Payments,  etc. — Any  club  or  association  which 
shall  fail  to  have  paid  its  annual  dues  at  the  expiration  of  one  month

from  it,  are  drawn  the  base  lines  D  E  and  F  G,  the  ends  of  which 
are  connected  by  the  side  lines  D  F  and  E  G.  Halfway  between  the 
side  lines,  and  parallel  with  them,  is  drawn  the  half  court  line  I  H, 
dividing  the  space  on  each  side  of  the  net  into  two  equal  parts,  the 
right  and  left  courts.  On  each  side  of  the  net,  at  a  distance  of  21 
feet  from  it,  and  parallel  with  it,  are  drawn  the  service  lines  K  L  and 
M  N. 

THE   BALLS. 

2.  The  Balls  shall  measure  not  less  than  21/2  inches,  nor  more  than 
2  9-16  inches  in  diameter ;  and  shall  weigh  not  less  than  1  15-16 
ounces,  nor  more  than  2  ounces. 

THE    GAME. 

3.  The  choice  of  sides,  and  the  right  to  serve  in  the  first  game, 
shall  be  decided  by  toss ;  provided  that,  if  the  winner  of  the  toss 
choose  the  right  to  serve,  the  other  player  shall  have  choice  of  sides, 
and  vice  versa,  or  the  winner  of  the  toss  may  insist  upon  a  choice  by 
his  opponent.  If  one  player  choose  the  court,  the  other  may  elect 
not  to  serve. 

4.  The  players  shall  stand  on  opposite  sides  of  the  net ;  the  player 
who  first  delivers  the  ball  shall  be  called  the  server,  and  the  other  the 
striker-out. 

5.  At  the  end  of  the  first  game  the  striker-out  shall  become  server, 
and  the  server  shall  become  striker-out ;  and  so  on  alternately  in  all 
the  subsequent  games  of  the  set  and  following  sets. 

6.  The  server  shall  serve  with  both  feet  behind,  i.  e.,  further  from 
the  net  than  the  base  line  and  within  the  limits  of  the  imaginary 
continuation  of  the  centre  service  and  the  side  lines.  It  is  not  a 
fault  if  one  only  of  the  server's  feet  do  not  touch  the  ground  at  the 
moment  at  which  the  service  is  delivered.  He  shall  place,  both  feet 
upon  the  ground  immediately  before  serving  and  shall  not  take  a  run- 
ning nor  a  walking  start.  He  shall  deliver  the  service  from  the  right 
and  left  courts  alternately,  beginning  from  the  right,  in  each  of  his 
service  games,  even  though  oddi  he  given  or  owed. 


226  SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

7.  Tlie  ball  served  must  drop  between  the  service  line,  half-court 
line,  and  the  side  line  of  the  court,  diagonally  opposite  to  that  from 
which  it  was  served. 

8.  It  is  a  Fault  if  the  ball  served  drop  in  the  net,  or  beyond  the 
service  line,  or  out  of  court,  or  in  the  wrong  court  ;  or  if  the  server 
do  not  stand  as  directed  by  law  6.  If  the  server,  in  attempting  to 
serve,  miss  the  ball  altogether,  it  does  not  count  a  fault,  but  if  the 
ball  be  touched,  no  matter  how  slightly,  by  the  racket,  a  service  is 
thereby  delivered,  and  the  laws  governing  the  service  at  once  J^pply. 

9.  A  fault  cannot  be  taken. 

10.  After  a  fault  the  server  shall  serve  again  from  the  same  court 
from  which  he  served  that  fault,  unless  it  was  a  fault  because  he 
served  from  the  wrong  court. 

11.  A  fault  cannot  be  claimed  after 'the  next  service  is  delivered. 

12.  The  server  shall  not  serve  until  the  striker-out  is  ready.  If 
the  latter  attempt  to  return  the  service,  he  shall  be  deemed  ready. 

13.  A  service  or  fault  delivered  when  the  striker-out  is  not  ready 
counts  for  nothing. 

14.  Tlie  service  shall  not  be  volleyed,  that  is,  taken,  before  it  has 
touched  the  ground. 

15.  A  ball  is  in  play  on  leaving  the  server's  racket,  except  as  pro- 
vided for  in  law  8.  and  remains  in  play  till  the  stroke  is  decided. 

16.  It  is  a  good  return,  although  the  ball  touch  the  net  ;  but  a 
service,  otherwise  good,  which  touches  the  net  shall  count  for  nothing. 

17.  The  server  wins  a  stroke  if  the  striker-out  volley  the  service, 
or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  service  or  the  ball  in  play,  or  if  he  return 
the  service  or  the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  oppo- 
nent's court ;  or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke,  as  provided  by  law  20. 

18.  The  striker-out  wins  a  stroke  if  the  server  serve  two  consecu- 
tive faults  ;  or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  ball  in  play  ;  or  if  he  return 
the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  opponent's  court  ;  or  if 
he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke  as  provided  by   law  20. 

19.  A  ball  falling  on  a  line  is  regarded  as  falling  in  the  court 
bounded  by  that  line. 

20.  Either  player  loses  a  stroke  if  the  ball  touch  him,  or  anything 
that  he  wears  or  carries,  except  his  racket  in  the  act  of  striking  ;  or 
if  he  touch  the  ball  with  his  racket  more  than  once  ;  or  if  he  touch 
the  net  or  any  of  its  supports  while  the  ball  is  in  play  ;  or  if  he  volley 
the  ball  before  it  has  passed  the  net. 

21.  In  case  a  player  is  obstructed  by  any  accident,  not  within  his 
control,  the  ball  shall  be  considered  a  "let."  But  when  a  permanent 
fixture  of  the  court  is  the  cause  of  the  accident,  the  point  shall  be 
counted.  The  benches  and  chairs  placed  around  the  court  shall  be 
considered  permanent  fixtures.  If,  however,  a  ball  in  play  strike  a 
permanent  fixture  of  the  court  (other  than  the  net  or  posts)  before 
it  touches  the  ground,  the  point  is  lost ;  if  after  it  has  touched  the 
ground,  the  point  shall  be  counted. 

22.  On  either  player  winning  his  first  stroke,  the  score  is  called  15 
for  that  player  :  on  either  player  winning  his  second  stroke,  the 
score  is  called  30  for  that  player  ;  on  either  player  winning  his  third 
stroke,  the  score  is  called  40  for  that  player  ;  and  the  fourth  stroke 
won  by  either  player  is  scored  game  for  the  player,  except  as  below. 
If  both  players  have  won  three  strokes,  the  score  is  called  deuce;  and 
the  next  stroke  won  by  either  player  is  scored  advantage  for  that 
nlayer.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next  stroke,  he  wins  the  game  ; 
if  he  lose  the  next  stroke  the  score  returns  to  deuce,  and  so  on  until 
one  player  wins  the  two  strokes  immediately  following  the  score  of 
deuce,  when  game  is  scored  for  that  player. 

23.  The  player  who  first  wins  six  games  wins  the  set ;  except  as 
below:  If  both  players  win  five  games  the  score  is  called  games  all; 
."-•.d  the  next  game  won  by  either  player  is  scored  advantage  game  for 


SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL.  227 

that  player.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next  game,  he  wins  the  set ; 
if  he  lose  the  next  game,  the  score  returns  to  games  all  ;  and  so  on, 
until  either  player  wins  the  two  games  immediately  following  the 
score  of  games  all,  when  he  wins  the  set.  But  the  committee  having 
charge  of  any  tournament  may  in  their  discretion  modify  this  rule 
by  the  omission  of  advantage  sets. 

24.  The  players  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first,  third 
and  every  subsequent  alternate  game  of  each  set  and  at  the  end  of 
each  set,  unless  the  number  of  games  in  such  set  be  even.  It  shall, 
however,  be  open  to  the  players  by  mutual  consent  and  notificajtion 
to  the  umpire  before  the  opening  of  the  second  game  of  the  match  to 
change  sides  instead  at  the  end  of  every  set  until  the  odd  and  con- 
cluding set,  in  which  they  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first, 
third  and  every  subsequent  alternate  game  of  such  set. 

*25.  In  all  contests  the  play  shall  be  continuous  from  the  first 
service  till  the  match  be  concluded  ;  provided,  however,  that  at  the 
end  of  the  third  set  either  player  is  entitled  to  a  rest,  which  shall 
not  exceed  seven  minutes,  and  provided,  further,  that  in  case  of  am 
unavoidable  accident,  not  within  the  control  of  the  contestants,  a 
cessation  of  play  which  shall  not  exceed  two  minutes  may  be  allowed 
between  points  ;  but  this  proviso  shall  be  strictly  construed,  and  the 
privilege  never  granted  for  the  purpose  of  allowing  a  player  to  recover 
his  strength  or  wind.  The  referee  in  his  discretion  may  at  any  time 
postpone  the  match  on  account  of  darkness  or  condition  of  the  ground 
or  weather.  In  any  case  of  postponement,  the  previous  score  shall 
hold  good.  Where  the  play  has  ceased  for  more  than  an  hour,  the 
player  who  at  the  cessation  thereof  was  in  the  court  first  chosen  shall 
have  the  choice  of  courts  on  the  recommencement  of  play.  He  shall 
etay  in  the  court  he  chooses  for  the  remainder  of  the  set.  The  last 
two  sentences  of  this  rule  do  not  apply  wtien  the  players  change  every 
alternate  game  as  provided  by  law  24. 

26.  If  a  player  serve  out  of  his  turn,  the  umpire,  as  soon  as  the 
mistake  is  discovered,  shall  direct  the  player  to  serve  who  ought  to 
ibave  served.  But  all  strokes  scored  before  such  discovery  shall  be 
counted.  If  a  game  shall  have  been  completed  before  such  discovery, 
then  the  service  in  the  next  alternate  game  shall  be  delivered  by  the 
player  who  did  not  serve  out  of  his  turn,  and  so  on  in  regular  rotation. 

27.  The  above  laws  shall  apply  to  the  three-handed  and  four- 
handed  games,  except  as  below : 

THE  THREE-HANDED  AND  FOUR-HANDED  GAMES. 

28.  For  the  three-handed  and  four-handed  games  the  court  shall 
be  36  feet  in  width;  4%  feet  inside  the  side  lines,  and  parallel  with 
them,  are  drawn  the  service  side  lines  K  M  and  L  N.  The  service 
lines  are  not  drawn  beyond  the  point  at  which  they  meet  the  service

in  the  first  game  shall  decide  which  partner  shall  do  so.  and  the  op- 
posing pair  shall  decide  in  like  manner  for  the  second  game.  The 
partner  of  the  player  who  served  in  first  game  shall  serve  in  the  third,

which  struck  out  in  the  last  game  of  the  last  set  may  serve  ;  and  the 
same  privilege  is  given  to  their  opponents  in  second  game  of  the  new 
set. 

32.  The  players  shall  take  the  service  alternately  throughout  the 
game ;  a  player  cannot  receive  a  service  delivered  to  his  partner  ; 
and  the  order  of  service  and  striking  out  once  established  shall  not 
he  altered,  nor  shall  the  striker-out  change  courts  to  receive  the

33.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  does  not  drop  between  the  service 
line,  half-court  line,  and  service  side  line  of  the  court,  diagonally 
opposite  to  that  from  which  it  was  served. 

34.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  does  not  drop  as  provided  in 
law  33,  or  if  it  touch  the  server's  partner  or  anything  he  wears  or 
carries.

Decisions  on  Doubtful  Points 

officially  recognized  hy  the  U.  8.  N.  L.  T.  A. 

I.  A  player  standing  outside  the  court  volleys  the  ball  or  catches 
it  in  his  hand,  and  claims  the  stroke  because  the  ball  was  certainly 
going  out  of  court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.  It  makes  no  difference  where 
he  was  standing.  The  return  is  presumed  good  until  it  strikes 
the  ground  outside  of  the  court. 

II.  A  player  is  struck  by  the  ball  served  before  it  has  touched 
the  ground,  he  being  outside  of  the  service  court.     How  does  it  count? 

Decision. — The  player  struck  loses  the  stroke.  The  service  is 
presumably  good  until  it  strikes  in  the  wrong  court.  A  player 
cannot  take  the  decision  upon  himself  by  stopping  the  ball.  If 
it  is  going  to  be  a  fault,  he  has  only  to  get  out  of  the  way. 

III.  The  service  is  delivered  before  the  striker-out  is  ready.  He 
tries  to  return  it  and  fails.    Is  he  entitled  to  have  it  played  over  again? 

Decision. — No.     If   he   attempts    to   return  the    service   he   is 

deemed  ready. 

.IV.     The   striker-out  calls   "not  ready,"   for  a   second  service.     The 

ball  strikes  beyond  the  service  line,  and  the  striker-out  claims  that  the 

fact  that  he  was  not  ready  makes  no  difference,   since  a  fault  cannot 

be  returned,  and,  therefore,  that  two  faults  have  been  served. 

Decision. — The  second  service  goes  for  nothing.  A  player 
cannot  call  "Not  ready,"'  and  then  have  the  service  count,  or 
not,  as  suits  his  interests. 

V.  A  ball  having  been  played  over  the  net  bounds  back  into  the 
court  from  which  it  came.  The  player  reaches  over  the  net  and  plays 
it  before  it  fall.     Has  he  a  right  to  do  so? 

Decision. — Yes.  provided  he  does  not  touch  the  net.  He  has 
a  right  to  play  the  ball  at  any  time  from  the  moment  it  crosses 
the  net  into  his  court  until  it  touches  the  ground  a  second  time. 

VI.  A  ball  is  played  into  the  net ;  the  player  on  the  other  side, 
thinking  that  the  ball  is  coming  over,  strikes  at  it  and  hits  the  net. 
Who  loses  the  stroke? 

Decision. — It  is  simply  a  question  of  fact  for  the  umpire  to 
decide.  If  the  player  touch  the  net  while  the  ball  was  still  in 
play  he  loses  the  stroke. 

VII.  Can  a  player  follow  a  ball  over  the  net  with  his  racket,  pro- 
vided that  he  hits  the  ball  on  his  own  side  of  the  net? 

Decision. — 'Yes,  the  only  restrictions  are  that  he  shall  not 
volley  the  ball  until  it  has  crossed  the  net,  and  that  he  shall 
not  touch  the  net  or  any  of  its  supports. 

VIII.  A  player's  racket  slips  out  of  his  hand  and  flies  into  the 
net.     Does  he  lose  the  stroke  for  hitting  the  net? 

Decision. — Yes,  if  the  ball  be  still  in  play.  It  does  not  mat- 
ter if  the  racket  be  in  a  player's  hand  or  not. 

IX.  A  player's  racket  leaves  his  hand,  but  meets  the  ball  and  re- 
turns it  oyer  the  net.     Is  it  a  good  return  ? 

Decision. — Yes.  There  is  no  law  requiring  a  racket  to  be  in 
a  player's  hand  when  the  ball  is  returned.  It  would  unques- 
tionably be  a  good  return  if  the  racket  were  held  against  the 
ground  by  a  player's  feet,  and  the  ball  bounded  back  off  of  it. 

X.  A  single  match  is  played  with  a  double  net  and  inside  posts.  A 
player   touches   the   net   beyond   the    inside  posts,   and   claims   that   he 


230  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

does   not    lose   the   stroke    because   there   should   be  no  net  more  than 

three  feet  outside  of  the  court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.  The  net  where  he  touches  it 
is  part  of  the  supports  of  the  net.  He  might,  perhaps,  have 
objected  to  the  arrangement  of  the  net  before  the  match. 

XI.  A  player  returns  the  ball,  and,  finding  that  he  cannot  stop 
himself  before  reaching  the  net,  jumps  over  it.     Is  it  a  good  return V 

Decision. — Law  4  requires  that  "the  players  shall  stand  ou 
opposite  sides  of  the  net,"  and  therefore  the  player  invading 
his  opponent's  court  loses  the  stroke. 

XII.  A  ball  passes  outside  the  post  of  the  net  and  strikes  in  court. 
Is  it  a  good  return  V 

Decision. — Yes. 

XIII.  A  ball  going  out  of  court  hits  the  top  of  the  posts  of  the 
net  and  hounds  into   the  opposite  court. 

Decision. — It  is  a  good  return. 

XIV.  TTie  service  or  the  ball  in  play  strikes  a  ball  lying  in  the 
court.     Can  it  be  returned? 

Decision. — Yes,  if  it  is  clear  to  the  umpire  that  the  right  ball 
is  returned. 

XV.  The  server  claims  that  the  striker-out  must  stand  in  the  court. 
Is  this  necessary  V 

Decision. — No.  The  striker-out  can  stand  wherever  he  pleases 
on  his  own  side  of  the  net. 

XVI.  A  bystander  gets  in  the  way  of  a  player  who  fails  to  return 
the  ball.     May  he  then  claim  a  let? 

Decision. — Yes,  if,  in  the  umpire's  opinion,  he  was  prevented 
by  an  accident  beyond  his  control.  For  instance,  if  the  ropes 
or  the  seats  are  allowed  to  be  so  near  to  the  court  that  a  player 
is  interfered  with  by  them,  the  stroke  should  not  be  played 
again,  because  the  ropes  and  seats  form  part  of  the  arrange- 
ments of  the  ground.  If,  however,  a  spectator  passes  in  front 
of  those  seats,  or  places  a  chair  nearer  than  the  original  line, 
and  so  interferes  with  a  player,  the  stroke  should  be  played 
again. 

XVII.  A  player  is  interfered  with  as  above,  and  the  umpire  directs 
the  stroke  to  be  played  again.  T'he  server  had  previously  served  a 
fault.     He  claims  the  right  to  two  services. 

Decision. — The  fault  stands,  A  let  does  not  annul  a  previous 
fault. 

XVIII.  A  return  hits  the  umpire,  or  his  chair  or  stand,  the  player 
claims  that  the  ball  was  going  into  court. 

Decision. — Stroke  is  lost, 

XIX.  A  player  receiving  fifteen  serves  from  the  left  court.  His 
opponent  claims  a  fault. 

Decision. — It  is  a  fault.  The  service  starts  from  the  right 
court  under  all   circumstances. 

XX.  At  fifteen-all  the  server  by  mistake  serves  from  the  left  court, 
he  wins  the  stroke  and  serves  again  (a  fault),  the  mistake  is  then 
discovered.  Is  he  entitled  to  the  previous  fault?  Prom  which  court 
should  he  serve  next? 

Decision. — The  previous  stroke  stands.  A  fault  cannot  be 
claimed  after  the  next  service,  good  or  not,  is  delivered.  The 
next  service  should  be  from  the  left  court,  the  score  being 
thirty-fifteen,  and  the  server  has  served  one  fault. 

XXI.  A  player  serves  from  the  wrong  court,  he  loses  the  stroke, 
and  then  claims  that  it  was  a  fault. 

Decision. — If  the  stroke  was  played  in  his  first  service  it  is 


I 


SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL.  231 

simply  a  fault,  but  if  he  serves  twice  into  the  wrong  court  he 
has  served  two  faults,  and  lost  the  stroke. 

XXII.  The  score  is  five  games  all,  and  the  umpire  directs  the  plav- 
ers  to  play  an  advantage  set.  The  advantage  game  has  been  w(ii, 
when  it  is  discovered  that  no  advantage  sets  are  to  be  played.  What 
is  to  be  done? 

Decision. — The  set  is  won  at  the  eleventh  game.  It  is  no 
part  of  the  umpire's  duty  to  decide  on  the  conditions  of  the 
matches. 

XXIII.  A  player  serves.  He  hears  the  umpire  call,  but  cannot 
hear  what  he  says.  He  knows  that  the  only  two  things  that  the 
umpire  should  call  are  "fault"  and  "let,"  and  that  in  neither  case  can 
the  ball  be  in  play.  He,  therefore,  does  not  return  it,  only  to  find 
that  the  umpire  has   called  "play."     Has  he  any   redress? 

Decision. — Iso. 

XXIV.  The  umpire  calls  "fault,"  and  then  instantly  changes  and 
says  "play."  The  striker-out  fails  to  return  the  ball,  and  he  claims 
he  was  prevented  by  the  umpire,  and  also  that  the  umpire  cannot 
change  his  decision. 

Decision. — Tlie  umpire  should  call  a  let  and  the  service  be 
taken  again. 

XXV.  A  ball  drops  near  a  line,  the  player  appeals,  and  the  umpire 
calls  "play."  The  player  misunderstands  the  call  and  lets  the  ball 
fall.     He  then  claims  to  have  the   stroke  played  again. 

Decision. — The  stroke  stands. 
XXVI.     The   ball   strikes   the   ground   close   to   a   line  ;   the   scorer 
scores  the  stroke  against  the  striker.     On  appeal  to  the  linesman,  the 
latter  decided  that  the  ball  was  not  out.     Which  decision  stands? 

Decision. — The  scorer  has  no  right  to  consider  a  ball  out 
until  the  linesman  has  called  to  that  effect,  therefore,  the  deci- 
sion of  the  latter  must  be  accepted.  The  decision  of  a  lines- 
man affecting  his  own  line  is  final. 

XXVII.  A  return  strikes  the  cord  running  along  the  bottom  of  the 
net  and  bounds  over.     Is  it  a  good  return  ? 

Decision.— Yes. 

XXVIII.  During  play  a  ball  is  thrown  into  court,  and  the  ball  in 
play  strikes  it  or  a  player  steps  on  it.     May  a  let  be  claimed? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXIX.  The  server's  first  service  strikes  his  partner.  Does  he  lose 
the  stroke  or  is  it  a  fault? 

Decision. — A  fault. 

XXX.  A  player  serves  a  fault  and  it  is  then  discovered  that  it  is 
his  partner's  service.     Does  the  fault  stand? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXXI.  In  a  four-handed  competition  one  player  does  not  appear 
in  time  to  play,  and  his  partner  claims  to  be  allowed  to  play  single- 
handed  against  the  opposing  pair.     May  he  do  so? 

Decision. — No. 


UNOFFICIAL  DECISIONS  ON  DOUBTFUL  POINTS. 
(From  Lawn  2'ennis.) 
Both    of   the   opponents    of   the   servers    in   doubles    are    strikers-out 
alternately  during  a  game.     It  is  optional  with  them  which  shall  serve 
first,  but  they  must  serve  alternately  thi'oughout  each  set. 

A  player  does  not  lose  a  stroke  for  striking  at  a  ball  that  ulti- 
mately falls  outside  his  court,  providing  he  does  not  touch  it  in 
doing  so. 


232  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

If  one  partner  of  a  double  team  strikes  at  a  ball  and  does  not 
touch  it,  his  partner  still  has  the  right  to  return  it.  A  player  or 
different  member  of  a  team  may  strike  at  a  ball  as  often  as  they 
Illease  ;  it  is  still  iu  play  until  hit. 

A  served  ball  is  only  a  "let"  if  otherwise  good,  falling  in  the  proper 
court ;  a  fault  cannot  be  a  "let." 

The  server  must  stand  behind  the  base-line,  within  the  limits  of  the 
.side-lines  of  the  court  in  which   he  is  playing. 

There  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of  "let"  balls  that  may  be  made 
on  the  service,  and  the  server  continues  serving  in  the  same  court 
until  a  good  service  is  delivered  or  two  faults  are  made. 

The  server  must  wait  until  the  striker-out  is  ready  for  the  second 
service  as  well  as  the  first,  and  if  the  striker-out  claims  to  be  not 
ready  and  does  not  make  any  effort  to  return  the  second  service,  the 
server  cannot  claim  the  point,  even  though  the  service  was  good. 

If  a  player's  racket  touches  the  net  after  the  ball  has  struck  the 
net,  he  does  not  lose  the  point.  The  ball  is  dead  .and  the  point  has 
been  won  and  lost  as  soon  as  the  ball  strikes  the  net,  and  nothing 
which  happens  afterward  can  affect  that  point.  If  the  ball  knocks 
the  net  against  the  player's  racket  the  same  decision  holds  good; 
It  is  simply  a  question  for  the  referee  to  decide  which  touches  the 
net  first. 

In  doubles  partners  must  receive  throughout  each  set  on  the  same 
sides  of  the  court  which  they  originally  select  when  the  set  begins. 
The  first  server  is  not  required  to  receive  in  the  right  court  ;  he  may 
select  either  side  at  the  beginning  of  the  set,  but  must  hold  this  to 
the  end. 

A  ball  served  with  a  sharp  cut  that  bounds  back  over  the  net  after 
having  struck  in  the  right  court  is  a  good  service.  Tlie  point  counts 
in  favor  of  the  server  if  the  striker-out  fails  to  return  it.  The  latter 
may  reach  over  the  net  to  return  the  ball,  but  loses  the  point  if  he 
touches  the  net  in  doing  so. 

A  return  made  from  one  side  of  the  court  that  passes  outside  of  the 
net  and  posts  without  going  over  them  is  still  good  if  the  ball  falls 
in  the  proper  court. 

The  ball  is  always  in  play  until  it  has  struck  the  ground  outside 
of  the  court,  or  the  net.  or  has  touched  the  ground  twice.  The  player 
loses  a  point  if  the  ball  touches  him  or  his  clothing  while  still  in  play, 
no  matter  whether  he  is  standing  outside  of  the  court  when  the  ball 
hits  him,  or  not. 

An  officially  recognized  decision  has  been  rendered  that  makes  any 
support  of  the  net — the  posts,  the  guv-ropes,  or  the  centre  fork — a 
part  of  the  net  itself,  and  any  ball  hitting  one  of  the  supports  and 
still  striking  the  right  court  is  considered  a  good  return  (except  on 
the  service).  The  posts  are  required  to  stand  outside  of  the  court, 
and  yet  a  ball  being  returned  at  a  sharp  angle  from  outside  might 
well  be  going  in  and  still  touch  one  of  the  posts. 

A  ball  is  dead  the  instant  it  has  touched  the  ground  outside  of  the 
court,  and  the  point  must  be  scored  at  once  against  the  other  side, 
no  matter  what  happens  after  the  ball  touches  the  ground. 

Consolation  matches  in  America  are  always  open  to  arw^  player 
beaten  in  his  first  match  actually  played.  •  Winning  by  default  before 
defeat  in  the  first  actual  match  does  not  disqualify  a  player  from 
the  consolation  event. 

The  services  must  always  come  alternately  from  the  right  and  left 
courts ;  if  the  server  delivers  the  ball  from  the  wrong  court  it  is  a 
fault. 

A  fault  cannot  be  played,  and  the  striker-out  has  no  option  in  the 
matter  ;  it  does  not  make  the  service  good  if  he  returns  it.

ber of  the  Committee. 

8.  The  Committee  shall  help  to  keep  order  on  the  ground,  and 
shall  consult  and  decide  upon  any  question  arising  out  of  the  competi-

their  number  :  and  they  shall  have  power,  when  so  convened,  the 
misconduct  of  a  competitor  having  been  reported  to  them  by  a  mem- 
ber of  the  Committee  or  an  Umpire,  to  disqualify  the  offender,  and 
further  to  order  him  off  the  ground,  should  his  misconduct  appear  ro 
them  to  justify  such  action,  but  before  such  action  shall  be  taken,  an 
opportunity  of  offering  an  explanation  shall  be  afforded  to  the  com- 
petitor whose  misconduct  has  been  reported  to  them.

(b)  To  call  the  faults  (subject  to  Regulation  10)  and  lets  unless 
he  delegates  such  power. 

(c)  To  call  the  strokes  when  won,  or  when  he  is  asked  to  call

The  Scoring  Sheet  shows  that  in  the  first  game  the  score  ran,  and  would 
have  been  called,  thus:  "15 — love,  30 — love,  30 — 15,  40 — 15,  40 — 30,  game

The  score  of  the  Server  should   be  called  first. 


NOTE — At  the  end  of  each  game  the  games  should  be  called  with  the 
name  of  the  player  who  is  in  advance,  thus:  "2  games  to  1,  B  wins"  or, 
*'B  leads."  If  the  games  are  level  the  score  should  be  called  thus,  "three 
games  all,"  or  as  the  case  may  be.  At  the  end  of  each  set  the  sets  should 
be  called  in  like  manner.

whose  decision  shall  be  final. 

NOTE— A  question  of  fact  relates  to  events  that  actually  happened.  A 
question  of  law  is  the  construction  and  application  of  the  laws  of  the  game 
to  be  admitted  facts. 

12.  The  Referee  shall  not  bet  on  a  match  nor  shall  an  Umpire  or

13.  No   competitor  may   transfer  his  entry   to  another   player. 

14.  Competitors  shall  have  a  right,  by  themselves  or  their  depu- 
ties, to  be  present  at  the  draw. 

15.  The  draw  shall  be  conducted  in  the  following  manner  :  Each 
competitor's  name  shall  be  written  on  a  separate  card  or  paper,  and 
these  shall  be  placed  in  a  bowl  or  hat,  drawn  out  one  by  one  at  ran- 
dom, and  copied  on  a  list  in  the  order  in  which  they  have  been  drawn. 


When  odds  are  owed,   they   should  be  marked  on  the  left  of   the  first  thick

When  two  players  in  different  classes  below  scratch  meet,  the  su- 
perior player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  received  by  the 
inferior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table  No.  1.  To  use  the 
table,  find  in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures  the  number  representing  the 
class  of  the  superior  player,  then  travel  along  the  horizontal  column 
until  the  vertical  column  is  reached  which  bears  at  the  top  the  num- 
ber of  the  class  of  the  inferior  player.  The  odds  specified  at  the  in- 
tersection of  the  two  columns  are  the  odds  required. 

Example. — If  class  3  has  to  meet  class  9,  start  from  the  figure  3 
in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures,  and  look  horizontally  until  the  vertical 
column  is  reached  headed  by  the  figure  9.  The  odds  given  at  the  point 
of  intersection  of  the  two  coiumns  (viz.  15  and  1-6  of  15)  are  the 
odds  required. 

When  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the  worst  players  en- 
tered in  great  (say  more  than  30),  it  is  desirable  to  handicap  the 
best  players  at  owed  odds.  The  players  above  scratch  (i.  e.,  owing

When  the  two  players  in  different  classes  above  scratch  meet,  the 
inferior  player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  owed  by  the 
superior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table.  No.  2. 

This  table  is  to  be  used  in  the  same  way  as  the  former,  the  class 
of  the  superior  player  being  looked  for  in  the  horizontal  line  of  fig- 
ures at  the  top,  and  the  class  of  the  inferior  player  in  the  diagonal 
line  of  figures. 

Example. — If  class  12  (owe  30)  meet  class  7  (owe  15  and  1-6  of 
15),  the  former  must  owe  the  latter  the  odds  of  4-6  of  15. 

21.  In  Championship  matches  and  handicaps  by  classes,  as  above, 
advantage  sets  shall  be  played  throughout. 

22.  The  Committee  may,  whether  appealed  to  by  any  competitor 
or  not.  postpone  the  meeting  or  any  match  or  part  of  a  match  if,  in 
their  opinion,  the  state  of  the  weather,  or  of  the  light,  or  the  condi- 
tion of  the  ground,  or  other  circumstances,  render  it  advisable  to  do 
so.     In  cases  of  postponement,  Law  25  must  be  strictly  observed.

for  five-sixths  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Thirty   (30)    is  two  strokes  on  each  game. 

Thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.1).  thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2),  thirty 
.and  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half-forty),  thirty  and  four-sixths  (30.4). 
thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and  forty  (40),  are  three  strokes  and 
two  given  on  the  corresponding  games  of  each  set,  as  in  the  fifteen 
series. 

OWED    ODDS. 

Owed  (or  minus)  oddsi  can  also  be  used  in  exactly  the  same  quanti- 
ties, the  chief  difference  being  that  the  better  player  is  required  to 
earn  the  owed  strokes  before  he  begins  to  score,  while,  in  the  case  of 
given  odds,  the  poorer  player  is  given  his  handicap  before  play  starts. 
These  owed  odds  may  be  used  either  in  conjunction  with  the  given  odds

244  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

or  separately.  In  order  that  the  handicaps  may  occur  as  seldom  as' 
possible  in  the  same  games,  when  two  players  meet,  one  of  whom  owes 
odds  and  the  other  receives  them,  the  games  on  which  owed  strokes 
are  paid  dififer  from  those  on  which  the  given  strokes  are  taken. 
Here  is  the  table  for  owed  odds  : 

One-sixth  (1-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  seventh,  thirteenth 
and  every  subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  seventh, 
ninth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Three-sixths  (3-6  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,, 
fifth  and  every  other  alternate  game  in  each  set. 

Four-sixths  (4-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fifth,  sixth 
and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Five-sixths  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fourth,  fifth, 
sixth  and  corresponding  games   in   each   set. 

Fifteen   (15)   is  one  stroke  owed  on  each  game. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (15.1),  fifteen  and  two-sixths  (15.2),  fifteen 
and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty),  fifteen  and  four-sixths  (15.4), 
fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5),  thirty  (30),  thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.1), 
thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2),  thirty  and  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half- 
forty),  thirty  and  four-sixths  (30.4),  thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and 
forty  (40),  correspond  to  the  fractions  of  fifteen,  as  do  the  larger 
handicaps  in  the  table  for  given  odds  correspond  to  the  fractions  of 
fifteen  in  that  table. 

The  simplest  method  for  handicappers  to  pursue  is  to  sort  out  the 
entries  for  the  event  they  are  to  handicap  into  classes  according  tc^ 
the  relative  skill  of  the  players.  Then  select  the  class  with  the  great- 
est number  of  players  in  it  and  place  them  on  scratch,  handicapping 
all  of  the  other  players  either  behind  or  in  advance  of  scratch  by 
owed  or  given  odds,  so  as  to  make  all  even  at  the  odds. 

In  deciding  upon  each  player's  handicap,  his  ability  as  compared 
with  the  scratch  men  should  first  be  considered,  and  then  as  compared 
with  his  nearest  and  furthest  rivals  in  the  tables  of  odds.  Each 
player  might  meet  any  of  the  others,  and  the  object  of  handicapping 
is  to  give  him  an  exactly  even  chance,  no  matter  whom  his  opponent 
may   be. 

It  should  be  remembered  that  it  is  easier  to  owe  15,  or  any  fraction 
of  it,  than  it  is  to  give  it,  and  when  odds  of  30  are  given,  the  poorer 
player's  score  has  already  reached  pretty  near  the  end  of  the  game, 
and  the  difference  between  him  and  the  best  men  must  be  very  great 
to  give  the  latter  an  even  chance,  should  they  meet. 

It  is  very  unwise  to  give  even  the  poorer  players  over  30.3  (half- 
forty),  and  very  seldom  is  it  safe  to  make  the  given  odds  run  higher 
than  30.  If  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the  poorest  players 
is  very  great,  place  the  latter  as  far  as  necessary  behind  scratch,  but 
do  not  advance  the  former  to  more  than  30,  or  30.3  in  the  most  ex- 
treme cases. 


HOW  TO  CONDUCT  A  TOURNAMENT. 

A  tournament  committee  should  first  of  all  be  selected,  with  not 
less  than  five  men,  and  as  many  as  possible  practical  workers  who 
have  the  time  and  inclination  to  closely  look  after  the  interests  of  the 
club.  At  its  first  meeting,  the  committee  should  decide  upon  all  de- 
tails of  the  meeting.  In  selecting  a  date,  it  is  advisable  to  choose 
one  immediately  before  or  after  some  established  tournament  in  the 
neighborhood,  for  then  the  entries  of  those  who  are  to  play  in  the 
other  event  can  generally  be  secured. 

Application  should  be  made  to  the  national  governing  body  for 
oflficial  sanction  for  the  tournament,  stating  dates  and  other  particn- 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  245 

Jars.  If  any  championship  events  are  to  be  on  the  programme,  official 
recognition  must  be  applied  for  before  these  titles  can  be  of  any  value. 
A  printed  circular  should  be  issued  by  the  tournament  committee, 
which  should  state  plainly — (1)  the  name  of  the  club  and  the  loca- 
tion of  the  courts  ;  (2)  the  date  of  the  meeting  and  the  hours  of  play  ; 
(3)  the  list  of  events,  and  the  championship  titles  (if  any)  to  be 
competed  for,  with  the  prizes  offered  for  each  event;  (4)  the  amount 
of  the  entrance  fees,  and  place  and  date  for  closing  the  list  of  entries  ; 

( 5 )  the  name  of  referee,  handicapper  and  tournament  committee  ;  and 

(6)  the  time  and  place  of  the  draw. 

The  draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  committee  in  public  and 
due  notice  of  the  time  and  place  be  given  to  the  competitors,  so  that 
they  may  be  present  or  represented  when  the  draw  is  made.  The 
draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  Bagnall-Wilde  system.  (See 
■"Tournament   Regulations,"   page  233). 

No  money  or  its  equivalent  in  any  form  should  be  offered  on  prizes, 
for  this  would  disqualify  the  players  from  future  competition  as  ama- 
teurs. Prizes  should  be  silver,  gold,  cut  glass,  objects  of  art  or  other 
souvenirs  of  this  kind  tiiat  can  be  marked  or  engraved  as  trophies. 
It  is  preferable  to  have  them  marked  before  the  tournament,  although 
lawn  tennis  prizes  are  frequently  bought  with  the  privilege  of  ex- 
change, and  therefore  not  engraved  until  after  the  touraament. 

The  committee  should  select  a  referee,  either  from  among  their  num- 
ber or  outside  of  it.  If  handicaps  are  to  be  held,  the  referee  may 
also  be  the  handicapper,  or  a  sub-committee  may  be  appointed  for  this 
purpose.  Should  the  referee  be  also  a  competitor,  a  substitute  should 
also  be  appointed  to  act  for  him  while  he  is  playing. 

It  is  important  to  have  enough  balls,  and  only  the  best  quality  of 
tournament  balls  should  be  used  for  matches.  It  is  the  custom  at  most 
tournaments  to  allow  three  new  balls  with  each  match,  but  in  play- 
ing on  dirt  courts,  the  same  balls  can  sometimes  be  made  to  do  service 
twice.  Unless  there  are  back-stops  close  behind  the  courts,  it  is  also 
well  to  have  some  small  boys  handy  to  act  as  ball-boys  and  "shack" 
the  balls  for  the  players. 

The  lines  of  a  tournament  court  should  be  marked  out  fresh  every 
day  and  if  easily  obliterated,  also  between  matches  on  the  same  day. 
T'he  courts  should  always  be  laid  north  and  south  so  that  one  player 
will  not  get  more  than  his  share  of  the  glaring  sunlight  in  his  eyes. 
Therei  should  never  be  a  tree  within  shadow  distance  of  a  tournament 
court  either,  particularly  on  the  south  side  of  the  court. 

Facilities  must  be  provided  for  the  players  to  dress,  and  it  is  a 
good  plan  to  appoint  one  member  of  the  committee  to  attend  to  these 
accommodations,  and  to  entertain  the  visiting  players  and  see  that 
their  wants  are  attended  to. 

The  draw  should  always  be  posted  in  a  conspicuous  place  on  the 
grounds,  where  the  spectators  as  well  as  the  players  can  inspect  it. 
If  possible  a  programme  for  each  day's  play  should  be  made  out  in 
advance,  and  due  notice  of  all  the  matches  of  the  day  be  posted  up  by 
the  draw  each  day.  The  courts  should  be  numbered,  and  a  certain 
"Court  and  hour  set  for  each  match.  One  member  of  the  committee 
ought  also  to  be  assigned  to  getting  umpires  for  the  matches  and 
■seeing  that  they  are  properly  started. 

It  is  customary  to  exhibit  the  prizes  for  a  tournament  at  the  club 
grounds  during  the  tournament,  and  it  generally  proves  an  attractive 
feature  to  have  them  displayed  on  a  table  on  the  grounds,  all  duly 
labeled  so  that  spectators  can  see  which  events  they  are  to  be  given 
for.  A  refreshment  tent  is  also  an  attractive  feature  at  a  tourna- 
ment and  the  prizes  are  then  displayed  under  this  tent  on  the  same 
or  a  nearby  table  with  the  punchbowl.  Lemonade,  or  tea,  crackers, 
cakes  and  sometimes  small  sandwiches  are  generally  served  to  the 
players  and  spectators  under  such  refreshment  tent. 


246  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

How  to  Build  and  Keep  a  Court 

Nothing  is  more  important  for  the  full  enjoyment  of  lawn  tennis 
than  a  satisfactory  court,  and  none  of  the  other  accessories  of  the 
game  offers  a  wider  variety.  Many  important  considerations  come  up' 
even  after  the  kind  of  court  to  be  built,  and  the  cost,  have  been  de- 
cided upon.  No  matter  how  much  is  to  be  spent  on  the  ground,  nor 
what  the  surface  is  to  be,  the  most  important  things  to  consider  first 
are  space,  light  and  drainage. 

The  back-stop  nettings  should  never  be  nearer  than  fifteen  feet  to 
the  lines,  and  if  good  players  are  expected  to  use  the  court,  particu- 
larly if  tournament  matches  are  to  take  place  on  it,  the  space  behind 
the  base-line  should  be  21  feet  at  each  end.  At  the  sides  at  least 
6  feet,  if  possible  12  feet  should  be  allowed  beyond  the  side-lines  for 
doubles  of  each  court.  A  well-appointed  court  for  tournament  play 
should  be  centered  in  an  unobstructed  space  of  not  less  than  60  x  120 
feet.  Wire  back-stop  netting  10  or  12  feet  high  should  surround  it 
at  these  distances  from  the  lines.  If  there  are  two  or  more  courts 
together,  there  should  be  at  least  12  feet  between  their  side  lines,  and 
one  netting  can  surround  all. 

In  selecting  a  site  for  a  court,  a  spot  should  be  chosen  where  there 
is  always  plenty  of  sunlight,  and  where  at  no  time  of  the  day  does 
any  shadow  cross  the  ground  on  which  the  court  is  to  be  laid.  Green, 
or  black  is  a  preferable  background  to  play  against,  but  any  dark  and 
even  color  will  do.  A  court  should  never  be  laid  out  with  any  very 
light  background  within  a  short  distance  at  either  end,  or  close  at 
either  side.  Nor  should  a  site  be  selected  with  a  badly  mixed  or 
moving  background.  Shade  trees  are  useful  near  a  court,  only  if  their 
shadow  is  a  solid  one,  not  constantly  checkered  by  flecks  of  sunlight 
glittering  through  moving  branches,  which  constantly  confuse  the 
players.  Never  should  they  be  allowed  near  enough  to  cast  any 
shadows  on  the  playing  surface. 

One  more  cardinal  point  should  be  remembered.  The  court  should 
invariably  be  laid  out  north  and  south — never  east  and  west.  If  this 
warning  is  disregarded,  the  player  at  one  end  or  the  other  will  be  hope- 
lessly blinded  by  the  sun. 

The  question  of  drainage  is  one  of  the  most  important  considerations 
in  selecting  a  site  of  this  kind.  On  the  natural  facilities  depends 
largely  the  cost  of  laying  out  a  good  court.  If  the  natural  soil  be 
sandy  and  well  drained,  or  if  it  is  on  high  ground  which  slopes  away 
near  by,  artificial  drain  pipes  will  not  have  to  be  put  in,  and  this 
saves  much  of  the  cost,  but  if  it  be  thick  clay  that  holds  moisture  long, 
or  on  low  ground  with  neighboring  slopes  that  drain  toward  it,  the 
court  will  be  useless  for  many  hour's  after  each  rainfall  unless  artificial 
drain-pipes  are  put  in. 

After  the  site  has  been  selected,  it  must  be  decided  whether  a  grass 
or  "dirt"  court  is  to  be  built.  If  the  natural  sod  is  luxuriant  and  the 
soil  favorable  for  its  growth,  or  if  the  court  is  not  to  be  used  enough 
to  wear  off  the  grass,  a  turf  court  will  generally  be  found  preferable, 
but  if  the  ground  is  to  be  constantly  in  use,  the  sod  will  wear  off  and 
become  "bald"  unless  there  is  space  enough  on  the  lawn  to  shift  the 
court  frequently. 

When  good  turf  cannot  be  had  or  will  not  stand  the  wear,  a  substi- 
tute must  be  found,  and  sand  or  dirt  courts  are  most  often  used. 
On  well-drained  land,  one  can  sometimes  cut  away  the  top  surface, 
level  the  ground  and  roll  it  until  well  hardened  and  the  court  is  ready 
for  use,  but  more  preparation  is  necessary  to  build  a  permanent  court 
that  will  not  be  constantly  losing  its  proper  level. 

For  such  a  court  the  earth  should  be  cut  away  to  a  depth  of  one 
foot  if  no  drains  are  required.     After  leveling  it  carefully  with  a  spirit- 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  247 

level,  to  be  sure  that  the  grade  is  right,  a  layer  of  six  inches  of  brokeu 
stone  should  first  be  laid  and  pounded  down  hard.  Ordinary  trap-rock 
used  for  macadamizing  roads  is  perhaps  the  best  for  this  purpose,  but 
any  broken  stone,  ranging  in  sizes  from  a  walnut  to  an  egg,  will  answer 
the  purpose.  This  should  be  covered  with  a  three-inch  layer  of  coarse 
gravel  or  fine  broken  stone,  which  should  be  thoroughly  pounded  and 
watered  for  several  days  before  being  covered.  Before  any  surface  is 
put  on  the  court,  the  greatest  care  should  be  taken  to  see  that  the 
foundation  is  perfectly,  level.  Any  holes  or  depressions  that  appear 
from  rolling  and  pounding  should  be  filled  in  before  it  is  covered. 

Every  well  built  court  should  be  graded  either  from  end  to  end  or 
from  side  to  side  to  an  extent  of  not  over  two  inches,  which  will 
suffice  to  drain  off  rain  water.  If  artificial  drainage  is  necessary  to 
keep  the  court  dry,  drain  pipes  can  be  laid  in  the  foundations  of  the 
court  about  three  feet  outside  the  side  and  end  lines,  care  being 
taken  whereby  the  pipes  will  tilt,  following  the  grade  of  the  court  as 
far  as  possible,  thus  allowing  the  water  to  run  off.  The  best  drain 
pipes  are  six-inch  stone  sewer  pipe,  cut  in  halves,  or  stone  gutters 
used  on  tiled  roofs,  which  should  be  sunk  in  the  ground  immediately 
under  the  foundation  of  broken  rock  and  filled  with  pebbles  or  fine 
cracked  stone. 

The  covering  for  a  gravel  or  sand  court  should  be  not  less  than 
three  nor  more  than  six  inches  in  thickness,  and  of  sandy  loam  and 
clay  mixed.  The  proportions  depend  on  the  quality  of  the  clay.  If  it 
is  very  binding  and  sticky,  one  part  of  sand  to  four  of  clay  are  pref- 
erable, but  for  the  average  ingredients  they  should  be  mixed  about 
eight  parts  of  clay  to  one  part  of  sand.  When  the  court  is  finished,  if 
it  is  found  to  be  too  soft  but  dry,  more  clay  should  be  added  ;  while  if 
it  drains  poorly  and  stays  muddy  too  long  after  rain,  or  its  surface  is 
too  sticky  for  the  player's  feet,  more  sand  should  be  added  on  the 
surface.  When  a  court  is  finally  covered,  it  should  be  thoroughly 
watered  and  rolled  alternately  twice  every  day  for  two  weeks  before  it 
is  played  on  at  all,  and  any  depressions  or  uneven  spots  corrected  as 
fast  as  they  appear  from  the  settling.  After  the  first  heavy  rain 
storm  it  should  be  gone  over  and  releveled  most  carefully,  for  then 
it  is  most  likely  to  develop  new  faults. 

The  fine  seashore  sand  will  seldom  be  found  satisfactory  for  the 
surface  of  a  court,  for  it  works  loose  too  quickly  under  the  players* 
feet,  and  can  only  be  made  to  bind  when  mixed  with  a  larger  propor- 
tion of  clay,  which  will  make  the  di-ainage  more  difficult,  as  water 
percolates  very  slowly  through  clay.  If  the  soil  upon  which  a  court 
is  being  built  is  very  rich  and  worms  promise  to  work  through  to  the 
surface  above  and  injure  the  court,  it  is  well  to  lay  a  layer  of  fine 
cinders,  those  from  a  railroad  engine  preferred,  between  the  foundation 
and  the  sandy  surface  layer.  These  cinders  effectually  prevent  worms 
from  coming  through  to  the  surface.  It  is  also  well  to  use  coarse 
sifted  ashes  mixed  with  the  stones  in  the  drain-pipes. 

The  construction  of  a  grass  court  is  less  difficult,  but  varies  much 
more  in  process.  If  cost  need  not  be  considered,  it  should  be  built 
by  an  expert,  and  will  be  laid  on  deep-laid  foundations ;  if  it  is 
desired  to  build  an  economical  court  on  an  available  lawn  which  is 
fairly  level,  the  cost  will  not  be  heavy.  The  sod  should  first  be  care- 
fully removed  in  squares  of  about  eighteen  inches,  from  a  space  at  least 
50  by  100  feet,  cutting  down  to  a  depth  of  about  six  inches.  The 
ground  should  then  be  turned  with  a  spade  to  a  depth  of  eighteen 
inches  or  two  feet,  and  after  all  stones  have  been  removed,  and  the 
earth  carefully  raked  over  and  leveled,  it  should  be  packed  and  rolled 
with  a  heavy  roller.  It  cannot  have  too  much  leveling  and  rolling, 
and  the  rolling  should  be  kept  up  for  several  days  with  plenty  of 
soaking  by  rain  or  hose-pipe.     Any  inequalities  which  the  heavy  pres- 


248  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

sure  of  the  roller  produces  should  be  filled  In  or  cut  down  before  the 
sods  are  relaid. 

After  the  ground  has  been  rolled  sufficiently  the  sods  should  be 
replaced.  In  doing  this  it  is  important  to  get  the  edges  close  together, 
so  that  no  seams  or  open  cracks  can  be  found.  These  sod^  should  be 
relaid  in  the  afternoon  and  well  di-enched  with  water.  TTie  next  day 
the  ground  should  be  rolled  again  ;  and  this  should  be  followed  by 
alternate  drenching  and  rolling  for  several  days.  Even  when  the 
ground  finally  appears  firm  and  level,  the  court  should  not  be  played 
upon  until  new  blades  of  grass  appear  in  considerable  numbers.  If 
depressions  appear,  the  sod  at  that  spot  should  be  lifted,  fresh  earth 
inserted  to  the  proper  grade  and  the  sod  replaced,  watered  and  rolled 
till  level  and  flat  again. 

Bad  spots  are  often  found  where  the  grass  is  thin  or  where  malignant 
weeds  obstruct  its  growth,  and  in  this  case  fresh  sods  should  be 
bought  or  cut  elsewhere  and  substituted.  Sometimes  large  patches  of 
ground  must  be  renewed  in  this  way,  but  it  will  be  found  much  less 
expensive  if  all  the  turf  is  bad  to  sow  the  new  court  down  with  lawn 
seeds,  and  seeds  will  often  help  out  thin  spots  in  the  grass  if  the 
court  is  not  to  be  used  too  soon  after  the  sowing.  It  is  better  to  make 
a  grass  court  in  the  fall  whether  it  is  to  be  sown  with  seed  or  sodded. 
The  winter  storms  will  then  settle  it  thoroughly,  and  after  a  little 
releveling  in  the  spring  it  will  be  ready  for  use. 

Grass  seeds  should  be  sown  between  the  middle  of  March  and  the 
first  of  May,  or  better  yet,  in  the  autumn,  between  the  middle  of 
August  and  the  first  of  October.  It  takes  about  20  pecks  of  good 
lawn  seed  to  cover  a  space  60  by  120  feet.  The  sowing  should  be 
gone  over  twice,  the  second  time  at  right  angles  to  the  first.  Clover 
seeds  should  be  avoided,  as  this  grass  does  not  wear  well,  and  guano 
should  not  be  used  for  fertilizing,  for  it  tends  to  bring  up  coarse  blades 
in  patches. 

As  soon  as  the  young  grass  is  high  enough  to  be  topped,  a  scythe  or 
sickle  should  be  used,  being  at  first  better  than  the  mowing  machine. 
After  the  new  grass  is  well  hardened,  however,  the  latter  should  be 
constantly  in  use,  never  less  than  once  a  week,  and  in  moist  warm 
weather  nearly  every  day.  With  every  precaution  weeds  are  sure  to 
appear,  but  these  can  generally  be  held  in  check  by  constant  mowing. 
The  more  formidable  weeds,  however,  must  be  cut  with  a  knife  one  by 
one;  about  an  inch  below  the  surface,  and  care  being  taken  to  remove 
as  much  of  the  root  as  possible.  A  pinch  of  salt  dropped  on  the  cut 
root  will  generally  stop  the  growth.  When  the  turf  becomes  worn  in 
spots  a  small  shift  in  the  lines  of  the  court  will  relieve  the  pressure 
and  enable  the  grass  to  grow  again  ;  at  the  end  of  the  season  all  of 
the  bare  patches  should  be  resown. 

There  are  several  other  kinds  of  courts  sometimes  built  when  turf 
cannot  be  had.  Cinders,  clay,  concrete,  cement  and  asphalt  are  also 
sometimes  used,  while  board  courts  are  built  undercover  for  winter  use. 

Concrete  and  cement  are  open  to  many  objections.  They  are  very 
hard  on  the  eyes  and  legs,  and  often  make  the  player's  feet  sore  ;  the 
surface  generally  wears  out  the  balls  and  shoes  quickly,  and  it  is  also 
liable  to  crack  with  frost.  Cinder  courts  are  cheap  and  easy  to  con- 
struct, but  the  surface  is  so  gritty  that  it  burns  the  feet  of  the  players 
and  soon  uses  up  the  balls.  They  are  also  very  dirty.  Asphalt  courts 
are  expensive  and  much  affected  by  heat  and  cold,  sometimes  even 
cracking  with  the  frost. 

In  Australia  courts  have  been  made  of  cracked  blue-stone,  while  a 
cheaper  substitute  has  been  found  in  England  in  what  is  called  a  brick 
rubble  court. 

Once  the  court  is  finally  built  and  ready  for  use,  it  must  be  properly 
marked  out.     In  every  case,  unless  it  be  of  grass,  and  the  lines  are 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  249 

to  be  constantly  shifted  to  prevent  bare  spots,  net-posts  should  be 
permanently  sunk  in  the  ground.  They  should  be  not  less  than  two 
feet  under  the  ground  nor  forty  feet  apart. 

A  good  dirt  court  should  be  swept,  watered,  rolled  and  freshly 
marked  out  after  every  eight  or  ten  sets  of  play,  and  oftener  in  very 
dry  weather.  Instantly  a  depression  is  discovered  it  should  be  filled 
in  and  rolled  down  before  playing  is  continued,  for  it  is  almost  as 
dangerous  for  the  players  as  the  court  to  continue  with  it  uneven. 
A  court  should  never  be  rolled  in  the  condition  the  players  leave  it 
after  play.  A  player's  heel  raises  a  little  lump  ;  if  the  roller  goes  over 
this  before  it  is  swept  down  even  again,  a  hard  ridge  results  and  the 
ball  will  bound  unevenly  from  it.  It  should  be  swept  over  first,  until 
all  the  lumps  are  leveled  down,  before  the  roller  is  allowed  on  its 
surface. 

One  of  the  best  sweepers  is  made  of  a  heavy  joist  of  wood  with  a 
dozen  thicknesses  of  old  jute  bagging  or  coarse  cloth  frayed  out  at  the 
bottom  edges,  fastened  to  its  bottom  and  trailing  on  behind  it.  This 
should  be  drawn  over  the  court  with  a  handle  or  rope  several  times. 
If  it  is  pushed,  the  groundsman's  feet  will  leave  tracks  after  it ;  if  he 
goes  ahead  the  sweeper  will  erase  them.  Before  the  lines  are  marked 
out  fresh,  the  old  ones  should  always  be  swept  off  with  a  broom,  but 
if  the  broom  is  constantly  used  along  the  lines  in  a  parallel  direction, 
it  will  gradually  wear  away  little  grooves  in  the  court  where  the  lines 
are  and  the  balls  will  bound  improperly  from  them.  The  sweeping 
should  be  done  lightly  across  the  court,  at  right  angles  with  the 
lines. 

A  grass  court  cannot  have  too  much  care.  It  is  advisable  to  wet  it 
thoroughly  several  times  a  week  and  roll  it  as  often.  It  should  be 
watered  at  night,  cut  in  the  morning,  and  rolled  after  cutting  and 
before  watering.  The  best  way  to  repair  a  bare  strip  of  ground  is  to 
lay  fresh  turf,  and  this  should  be  done  in  the  fall  or  as  early  as  pos- 
sible in  the  spring.  Good  tough  turf,  laid  in  February  or  early  in 
March,  will  be  fit  for  use  by  the  first  of  June.  In  the  early  spring 
grass  roots  both  in  new  turf  and  old  may  be  greatly  benefited  by  a 
good  dressing  of  manure  well  worked  in,  but  regular  manuring  should 
also  be  done  in  the  fall. 

Worm  casts  are  very  bad  for  good  tennis  turf.  Particularly  in 
fertile  ground  or  after  a  storm,  the  little  mounds  will  appear  on  the 
sod,  and  if  the  roller  passes  over  them  or  they  are  trodden  down  little 
hard  lumps  are  formed  which  spoil  the  surface  of  the  court.  The  turf 
should  always  be  swept  before  rolling,  and  in  rich  soil  every  morning. 
This  scatters  the  mounds  effectually.  Where  is  is  necessary  to  get 
rid  of  the  worms,  lime  water  should  be  sprinkled  on  the  ground.  They 
will  then  come  to  the  surface  and  can  be  swept  away. 

When  a  horse  mowing  machine  is  used  it  is  well  to  have  the  horse's 
hoofs  covered  with  soft  pads  to  prevent  their  cutting  into  the  turf 
and  leaving  prints  that  affect  the  bound  of  the  ball.  The  groundsman 
at  work  on  good  lawn  tennis  courts,  particularly  when  the  turf  is 
soft,  and  always  on  a  sand  court,  should  be  required  to  wear  rubber- 
soled  shoes  without  heels.

How  to  Lay  Out  a  Tennis  Court 

A. G_.„ ,D 


As  a  double  court  practically  Includes  every  line  to  be  found  in  a 
single  court,  it  is  best  to  take  first  the  measure  for  the  latter.  Hav- 
ing determined  the  position  of  your  net,  plant  in  the  ground,  in  the 
line  chosen,  two  pegs,  27  feet  apart  (at  the  points  A  and  B  in  the 
diagram).  Then  take  two  measures  and  attach  their  respective  ends 
to  the  pegs  A  and  B.  On  the  first,  which  will  measure  the  diagonal 
of  the  court,  take  a  length  of  47  feet  5  inches  ;  on  the  other  39  feet ; 
pull  both  taut  in  such  directions  that  at  these  distances  they  meet 
in  a  point  C.  This  will  give  one  corner  of  the  court.  At  that  point  F, 
21  feet  from  B,  put  in  a  peg  to  mark  the  end  of  the  service-line.  The 
other  corner,  D,  and  the  other  end  of  the  service-line  G,  may  be 
found  by  interchanging  the  measures  and  repeating  the  process.  The 
same  measurements  on  the  other  side  of  the  net  will  complete  the 
exterior  boundaries  of  the  court.  By  prolonging  the  base-line  4  feet 
6  inches  in  each  direction,  and  joining  the  four  new  points  thus 
obtained,  we  can  make  the  side-lines  of  a  double  court.  It  only 
remains  to  mark  the  central  line.  This  is  done  by  joining  the  middle 
points  of  the  service-lines.  If  a  double  court  alone  be  required,  the 
interior  side-lines  need  not  be  prolonged  to  meet  the  base-lines. 
Remember  that  in  all  cases  the  net-posts  must  stand  at  a  distance 
of  three  feet  from  the   side-lines.

racket  is  sold  upon  its  own 
reputation  and  the  Spalding 
Guarantee  is  your  assurance 
of  satisfaction. 

The  difference  between

We  use  a  dogwood  insertion  in  shoulders,  after  proving  to  our 
satisfaction,  by  experience,  that  it  is  far  superior  to  cane  or 
other  material  for  the  purpose.

pointed  at  lower  end 
so  as  to  go  24  inches 
into  ground  and  equip- 
ped with  wheel  at  top. 
Ratchet  for  tighten- 
ing net  is  of  an  im- 
proved style,  neat  in 
appearance  but  with 
a  particularly  strong 
leverage.  Iron  hooks 
and  cleats  for  fasten- 
ing ropes. 


One  of  the  special 
features  of  this  style 
post,  outside  of  the 
ratchet,  is  the  method 
of  ensuring  absolute 
rigidity  when  net  is  in 
position.  By  means  of  triple 
claw  clutches,  made  of  heavy 
wrought  iron,  there  can  be 
no  shifting  or  shaking  once 
they  are  placed  in  position, 
and  the  tighter  the  net  is 
drawn  the  more  rigid  the 
posts  become.

"AUTO-LOC" 

TENNIS   POSTS 

Fitted  with    Patented  "Anto-Iioc" 
Tightening  Ratchet 

These  are  absolutely  the  highest 
grade  wooden  posts  made.  We  rec- 
ommend them  especially  for  private 
courts  or  wherever  it  is  desirable  to 
remove  posts  after  play  is  finished. 
The  "Auto-Loc"  tightening  ratchet 
is  a  patented  device  which  permits 
the  closest  adjustment  in  tighten- 
ing and  regulating  the  height  of  the 
net,  and  locks  automat- 
icaly  and  instantly  as 
soon  as  released. 

The    spade-shaped 
iron  sockets  with 
which  these  posts  are 
equipped   are   driven 
into  the  ground  in  the 
proper  position  for  the 
posts,  which  are  fitted 
with  iron  bases  termin- 
ating in  square  iron 
extensions  which  fit  ex- 
actly the   sockets  in 
the  spade  bases  and 
keep  the  posts  abso- 
—  lutely  rigid  when 
placed   in   position. 
When  posts  are  re- 
moved_  from  sockets 
there  is  no  project- 
ing obstruction,  and 

we  furnish  a 

block  of  wood 

to  be  inserted 

in  the  hole  in 

each  socket  as^ 

soon  as  the 

posts  are  taken 

up.     We  also 

furnish  hooks 

with  handles 

for  removing 

sockets   from 

ground  when- 
ever it  may  be 

necessary  to 

do  so.

Spalding  "Club'* 

Tennis  Posts 

To  ensure  absolute 
rigidity,  a  prime 
requisite  in  a  ten- 
nis post,  it  is  really 
necessary  that 
some  part  of  the 
post  itself  should 
gointotheground, 
Our  "Club"  Ten- 
nis posts  are  made 
on  this  principle 
and  of  best  quality 
2f-in.  square  ash, 
nicely  polished  and., 
varnished,  equip- 
ped with  japanned 
braces  so  as  to 
make  posts  ab- 
solutely 
rigid,  and 
when  set 
in  position   the 
posts   extend  30 
inches  into  the 
ground. 
We  call  particular  atten 
tion  to  the  extra  heavy  brass 
ratchet  with  which  we  equip 
this  style  post.    It  is  made 
after  an  English  design  and 
is  the  same  as  supplied  by 
our  London  House  to  some 
of  the  best  clubs  in  Great 
Britain.

that  it  is  not  necessary 
to  send  to  the  other  side 
for  Squash  Rackets. 
The  leading  players  are 
now  using  Spalding 
goods  with  general  sat- 
isfaction, and  we  look

Standard  Policy 

A  Standard  Quality  must  be  inseparably  linked  to  a  Standard  Policy. 

Without  a  definite  and  Standard  Mercantile  Policy,  it  is  impossible  for  a  manufacturer  to  long 
maintain  a  Standard  Quality. 

To  market  his  goods  through  the  jobber,  a  manufacturer  must  provide  a  profit  for  the  jobber  as 
well  as  the  retail  dealer.  To  meet  these  conditions  of  Dual  Profits,  the  manufacturer  is  obliged  to 
set  a  proportionately  high  list  price  on  his  goods  to  the  consumer. 

To  enable  the  glib  salesman,  when  booking  his  orders,  to  figure  out  attractive  profits  to  both  the 
jobber  and  retailer,  these  high  list  prices  are  absolutely  essential;  but  their  real  purpose  will  have  been 
served  when  the  manufacturer  has  secured  his  order  from  the  jobber,  and  the  jobber  has  secured  his 
order  from  the  retailer. 

However,  these  deceptive  high  list  prices  are  not  fair  to  the  consumer,  who  does  not,  and,  in 
reality,  is  not  ever  expected  to  pay  these  fancy  list  prices. 

When  the  season  opens  for  the  sal(^  of  such  goods,  with  their  misleading  but  alluring  high  list 
prices,  the  retailer  begins  to  realize  his  responsibilities,  and  grapples  with  the  situation  as  best  he 
can,  by  offering  "special  discounts,"  which  vary  with  local  trade  conditions. 

Under  this  system  of  merchandising,  the  profits  to  both  the  manufacturer  and  the  jobber  are 
assured;  but  as  there  is  no  stability  maintained  in  the  prices  to  the  consumer,  the  keen  competition 
amongst  the  local  dealers  invariably  leads  to  a  demoralized  cutting  of  prices  by  which  the  profits  of 
the  retailer  are  practically  eliminated. 

This  demoralization  always  reacts  on  the  manufacturer.  -The  jobber  insists  on  lower,  and  still 
lower,  prices.  The  manufacturer,  in  his  turn,  meets  this  demand  for  the  lowering  of  prices  by  the 
only  way  open  to  him,  viz. :  the  cheapening  and  degrading  of  the  quality  of  his  product. 

The  foregoing  conditions  became  so  intolerable  that,  ten  years  ago,  in  1899,  A.  G.  Spalding 
&  Bros,  determined  to  rectify  this  demoralization  in  the  Athletic  Goods  Trade,  and  inaugurated  what 
has  since  become  known  as  "The  Spalding  Policy." 

The  "Spalding  Policy"  eliminates  the  jobber  entirely,  so  far  as  Spalding  Goods  are  concerned, 
and  the  retail  dealer  secures  his  supply  of  Spalding  Athletic  Goods  direct  from  the  manufacturer 
under  a  restricted  retail  price  arrangement  by  which  the  retail  dealer  is  assured  a  fair,  legitimate  and 
certain  profit  on  all  Spalding  Athletic  Goods,  and  the  consumer  is  assured  a  Standard  Quality  and  is 
protected  from  imposition. 

The  "Spalding  Policy"  is  decidedly  for  the  interest  and  protection  of  the  users  of  Athletic  Goods, 
and  acts  in  two  ways: 

First— The  user  is  assured  of  genuine  Official  Standard  Athletic  Goods,   and 

the  same  fixed  prices  to  everybody, 
Second— As  manufacturers,  we  can  proceed  with  confidence  in  purchasing  at 
the  proper  time,  the  very  best  raw  materials  required  in  the  manufacture 
of  our  various  goods,  well  ahead  of  their  respective  seasons,  and  this  enables 
us  to  provide  the  necessary  quantity  and  absolutely  maintain  the  Spalding 
Standard  of  Quality. 
All  retail  dealers  handling  Spalding  Athletic  Goods  are  required  to  supply  consumers  at  our 
regular  printed  catalogue  prices— neither  more  nor  less— the  same  prices  that  similar  goods  are  sold 
for  in  our  New  York,  Chicago  and  other  stores. 

All  Spalding  dealers,  as  well  as  users  of  Spalding  Athletic  Goods,  are  treated  exactly  alike,  and  no 
special  rebates  or  discriminations  are  allowed  to  anyone. 

Positively,  nobody;  not  even  officers,  managers,  salesmen  or  other  employes  of  A.  G.  Spalding 
&  Bros.,  or  any  of  their  relatives  or  personal  friends,  can  buy  Spalding  Athletic  Goods  at  a  discount 
from  the  regular  catalogue  prices. 

This,  briefly,  is  the  "Spalding  Policy,"  which  has  already  been  in  successful  operation  for  the 
past  ten  years,  and  will  be  indefinitely  continued. 

In  other  words,  "  The  Spalding  Policy  "  is  a  "  square  deal "  for  everybody.

standard  Quality 

An  article  that  is  universally  given  the  appellation  "Standard"  is  thereby 
conceded  to  be  the  Criterion,  to  which  are  compared  all  other  things  of  a  similar  nature. 
For  instance,  the  Gold  Dollar  of  the  United  States  is  the  Standard  unit  of  currency, 
because  it  must  legally  contain  a  specific  proportion  of  pure  gold,  and  the  fact  of  its 
being  Genuine  is  guaranteed  by  the  Government  Stamp  thereon.  As  a  protection  to 
the  users  of  this  currency  against  counterfeiting  and  other  tricks,  considerable  money 
is  expended  in  maintaining  a  Secret  Service  Bureau  of  Experts.  Under  the  law,  citizen 
manufacturers  must  depend  to  a  great  extent  upon  Trade-Marks  and  similar  devices 
to  protect  themselves  against  counterfeit  products— without  the  aid  of  "Government 
Detectives "  or  "Public  Opinion "  to  assist  them. 

Consequently  the  "Consumer's  Protection "  against  misrepresentation  and  "in- 
ferior quality"  rests  entirely  upon  the  integrity  and  responsibility  of  the  "Manufacturer." 

A.  G.  Spalding  &  Bros,  have,  by  their  rigorous  attention  to  "Quality,"  for  thirty- 
three  years,  caused  their  Trade-Mark  to  become  known  throughout  the  world  as  a 
Guarantee  of  Quality  as  dependable  in  their  field  as  the  U.  S.  Currency  is  in  its  field. 

The  necessity  of  upholding  the  guarantee  of  the  Spalding  Trade-Mark  and  main- 
taining the  Standard  Quality  of  their  Athletic  Goods,  is,  therefore,  as  obvious  as  is  the 
necessity  of  the  Government  in  maintaining  a  Standard  Currency. 

Thus  each  consumer  is  not  only  insuring  himself  but  also  protecting  other  con- 
sumers when  he  assists  a  Reliable  Manufacturer  in  upholding  his  Trade-Mark  and  all 
that  it  stands  for.  Therefore,  we  urge  all  users  of  our  Athletic  Goods  to  assist  us  in 
maintaining  the  Spalding  Standard  of  Excellence,  by  insisting  that  our  Trade-Mark  be 
plainly  stamped  on  all  athletic  goods  which  they  buy,  because  without  this  precaution 
our  best  efforts  towards  maintaining  Standard  Quality  and  preventing  fi*audulent 
substitution  will  be  ineffectual. 

Manufacturers  of  Standard  Articles  invariably  suffer  the  reputation  of  being 
high-priced,  and  this  sentiment  is  fostered  and  emphasized  by  makers  of  "inferior 
goods,"  with  whom  low  prices  are  the  main  consideration. 

A  manufacturer  of  recognized  Standard  Goods,  with  a  reputation  to  uphold  and  a 
guarantee  to  protect,  must  necessarily  have  higher  prices  than  a  manufacturer  of  cheap 
goods,  whose  idea  of  and  basis  for  a  claim  for  Standard  Quality  depends  principally 
upon  the  eloquence  of  the  salesman. 

We  know  from  experience  that  there  is  no  quicksand  more  unstable  than  poverty 
in  quality— and  we  avoid  this  quicksand  by  Standard  Quality.
