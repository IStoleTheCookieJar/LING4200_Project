Wayne  Green  W2NSD/1 


Do  You  Suppose?  Maybe? 
Naw,  It's  Impossible 
No  Use  Even  Trying 

There's  something  that's  been  puz- 
zling me  for  ages.  Actually,  now  that  I 
come  to  think  of  ilt  there  Ve  been  sev- 
eral things  that  have  been  puzzling 
me.  and  which  now  make  sense.  Like 
how  come  no  one  has  written  any  re- 
ally creative  classical  music  in  the  last 
50  to  60  years?  Like  how  come  so 
many  readers  tell  me  they  don't  al* 
ways  agree  with  my  editorials?  Like 
why  we  Americans  put  up  with  the 
crooks  we've  been  sending  to  Wash- 
ington; our  crummy  post  office;  our 
dreadful  schools  .  .  .the  most  expen- 
sive and  worst  in  the  industrial  world 
. ,  t  and  so  on. 

I've  seen  the  same  pattern  in  ama- 
teur radio,  with  an  infinite  tolerance  for 
League  mendacity,  and  of  course 
there's  this  whole  CW  nonsense- 

Yes.  I  admit  I'm  probably  part  of  the 
problem  in  that  I  tend  to  be  much  too 
cautious  about  speaking  my  mind. 
Allen  Turott,  the  chap  who  invented 
the  game  of  Boggfe  and  an  old  car  ral- 
ly buddy  of  mine,  used  to  call  me 
Wishy-washy  Wayne  because  I  was 
SO  hesitant  about  expressing  my  opin- 
ions ,  _  and  so  insecure  in  them,  once 
Ihey  were  pried  out  of  me. 

Suddenly  several  things  which 
have  been  puzzling  me  fit  together 
and  made  sense  when  I  read  a  book 
by  John  Gatto.  He's  the  New  York 
State  Teacher  of  the  Year  you've  prob- 
ably seen  on  TV*  and  his  book,  Dumb- 
ing Us  Down  —  The  Hidden  Curricu- 
lum of  Compulsory  Schooling,  is  a 
corker.  For  the  few  of  you  who  have 
survived  our  school  system  and  actu- 
ally read,  I'll  make  copies  available 
through  Uncle  Wayne's  Bookshelf. 

I  semi-survived  our  public  school 
system,  but  it  so  numbed  me  that  it 
wasn't  until  I  went  through  a  new  kind 
of  psychotherapy  when  I  was  28  that  I 
was  able  to  actually  start  thinking. 
That's  when  I  started  reading  and 
building  my  library.  I  referred  to  this 
therapy  when  I  described  how  the 
mind  works  in  my  October  1992  edito- 
rial. Til  eventualfy  explain  how  almost 
anyone  can  help  others  to  start  think- 
ing and  stop  just  reacting. 

John  Gatto's  book  is  the  most  dev- 
astating indictment  of  public  education 
I've  seen  yet,  Oht  we've  known  (or 
4  73 A mateur  Radio  Today*  May, 


over  1 0  years  that  we  have  one  of  the 
worst  educational  systems  in  the  in* 
dustrial  world  .  -  .  which  makes  up  for 
its  terrible  results  by  being  one  of  the 
most  expensive.  But  whal  we  haven't 
considered,  and  what  even  John  Gatto 
hasn't  suggested,  is  that  the  end  result 
of  this  lousy  system  has  been  a  throt- 
tling of  creativity  and  genius,  a  gener- 
ally negative  approach  to  new  ideas, 
and  a  fear  of  opposing  the  system. 

If  you  stop  and  think  about  it,  not 
only  haven't  we  seen  any  really  out- 
standing composers  in  ihe  last  60 
years  or  so,  we've  also  seen  a  drop  in 
creativity  in  artt  literature,  poetry  and 
so  on.  We've  seen  a  deterioration  of 
the  whole  country.  Now  I  think  I  know 
what's  gone  wrong. 

When  I  read  a  book  I  keep  a  High- 
lighter at  hand.  Well,  my  Gatto  book  is 
an  epic  in  yellow  swatches.  Unfortu- 
nately, since  you  are  a  product  of  our 
educational  system,  the  chances  are 
that  you  find  books  boring,  and  be- 
sides, you  know  that  there's  nothing 
you  can  do  to  change  things,  so  why 
bother.  Even  so  I'm  going  to  make  this 
book  available  to  the  few  of  you  who 
have  escaped  being  totally  destroyed 
by  the  system  and  who  still  have  some 
shreds  of  interest  In  understanding 
what's  happened  to  all  of  us.  It's  avail* 
able  from  Uncle  Wayne's  Bookshelf, 
Once  you  read  it  you  will  want  to  get 
copies  for  what  few  friends  you  have 
who  are  functionally  literate. 

What  Our  Children  Are 
Actually  Being  Taught 

John  points  out  that  he  leaches 
seven  basic  concepts.  Me  teaches 
confusion  by  dealing  with  subjects  out 
of  context  and  not  relating  them,  Cur- 
riculums  have  no  cone  ranee. 

He  teaches  class  position  ...  to  en- 
vy and  fear  better  classes  and  have 
contempt  for  lower  classes  and 
groups.  He  understands  that  truth  and 
schootteaching  are  incompatible,  as 
Socrates  pointed  out  thousands  of 
years  ago. 

He  teaches  indifference  -  *  .  that  no 
job  is  worth  finishing,  ami  this  is  driven 
home  by  bells,  which  stop  everything 
in  midstream.  Nothing  is  worth  finish- 
ing, so  why  care? 

He  teaches  emotional  dependency. 
Rights  do  not  exist  inside  a  school ,  . . 
not  even  free  speech  .  .  .  unless  the 

1993 


teacher  says  they  do  >  ,  .  not  even  to 
go  to  the  toilet. 

He  teaches  intellectual  dependen- 
cy. Successful  students  do  the  think- 
ing he  assigns  them,  with  little  resis- 
tance and  a  show  of  enthusiasm.  Cu- 
rios sty  causes  trouble,  so  conformity  is 
rewarded.  Wail  to  be  lofd  what  to  do. 

He  teaches  provisional  self-esteem, 
The  lesson  of  report  cards,  tests  arid 
grades  is  that  children  should  not  trust 
themselves  or  their  parents,  but 
should  rely  on  the  evaluation  of  certi- 
fied officials. 

He  teaches  that  one  can't  hide.  In 
school  there  are  no  private  places, 
Children  must  be  closely  watched  if 
you  want  to  keep  them  under  tight 
control 

He  says,  'It  is  the  great  triumph  of 
compulsory  government  monopoly 
mass -schooling  that  among  even  the 
best  of  my  fellow  teach ersr  and  among 
even  the  best  of  my  students'  parents, 
only  a  small  number  can  imagine  a  dif- 
ferent way  to  do  things  .  * .  the  truth  Is 
that  reading,  writing,  and  arithmetic 
only  take  about  one  hundred  hours  to 
transmit  as  long  as  the  audience  is  ea- 
ger and  willing  to  learn." 

Now  is  it  entirely  a  coincidence  that 
artistic  creativity  dwindled  as  public 
education  look  hold?  It  was  started  in 
the  mid-1 800s  by  a  group  of  socialists, 
but  didn't  take  over  completely  until 
around  1380,  when  the  militia  finally 
forced  parents  at  gunpoint  lo  send 
their  children  to  public  schools.  The 
system  grew  in  administrative  bureau- 
cracy and  control  through  the  1920s. 

Gatto  says,  "When  children  are  giv- 
en whole  lives  instead  of  age-graded 
ones  in  oeliblocks,  they  learn  to  read, 
write  and  do  arithmetic  with  ease."  He 
points  out,  "Out  of  the  t68  hours  in 
each  week  my  children  sleep  56,  That 
leaves  112  hours  a  week  out  of  which 
to  fashion  a  self.  Children  watch  55 
hours  of  television  a  week.  That 
leaves  them  57  hours  a  week  in  which 
to  grow  up.  They  attend  school  30 
hours  a  week,  use  about  eight  hours 
getting  ready  for  it  and  traveling  to  and 
from  school,  and  spend  an  average  of 
seven  hours  a  week  in  homework,  a 
total  of  45  hours.  During  that  time  they 
are  under  constant  surveillance.  That 
leaves  ihem  12  hours  a  week  out  of 
which  to  create  a  unique  conscious- 
ness. If  we  allot  three  hours  a  week  to 


evening  meals  we  arrive  at  a  net 
amount  of  private  time  for  each  child 
of  nine  hours  per  week/ 

Gatto  suggests  that  this  develops 
dependent  personalities  and  that  this 
has  a  lot  to  do  with  Hie  things  that  are 
killing  us,  such  as  narcotics,  brainless 
competition,  recreational  sext  vio- 
lence, gambling,  alcohol,  and  the  ac- 
cumulation  of  things  as  a  philosophy. 
This  is  what  this  brand  of  schooling 
must  inevitably  produce. 

The  results  he  sees  are  children 
who  are  indifferent  to  the  adult  world, 
who  have  almost  no  curiosity,  who 
have  a  poor  sense  of  the  future,  who 
have  no  sense  of  the  past  are  cruel  to 
each  other,  are  uneasy  with  intimacy 
and  candor,  who  are  materialistic,  and 
who  are  dependent,  passive,  and  timid 
when  faced  with  new  challenges.  Is  it 
any  wonder  that  he  says  we  don't 
need  more  schooling,  we  need  less? 
He  believes  that  education  should 
make  you  a  unique  individual,  not  a 
conformist 

When  I  see  teenagers  with  the 
knees  out  of  their  jeans  1  know  I'm 
looking  at  conformity-driven  kids  who 
have  been  so  brainwashed  they're  un- 
able to  think  for  themselves.  When  I 
get  fetters  from  readers  who  tell  me 
they  don't  always  agree  with  what  I 
write  I  know  I'm  dealing  with  someone 
who  has  never  learned  to  think.  No,  1 
don't  mean  everyone  has  to  agree 
with  everything  I  write.  If  that's  your  re- 
action, it  proves  you  don't  gel  it 
and  may  never  *get  it."  When  some- 
one disagrees  with  me  \  expect  the 
honesty  of  ihem  telling  me  what  they 
don't  agree  with  and  what  information 
they  have  to  substantiate  ifieir  opinion. 

It  Is  rare  that  I  meet  survivors  of  our 
school  system  who  think  positively. 
The  normal  reaction  to  ideas  is  to 
come  up  with  reasons  why  they  won't 
work.  These  are  usually  emotion-driv- 
en, not  logic-  or  thought-driven. 

I  have  to  admit  to  being  frustrated 
by  the  infinite  capacity  of  the  American 
people  to  accept  the  screwing  the  gov- 
ernment is  giving  them.  They  may 
grouse  a  bit,  but  are  terrified  i!  there's 
a  suggestion  that  they  might  be  quot- 
ed. They  are  annoyed  at  the  massive- 
ly crooked  Congress  they've  elected, 
yet  they  just  re-elected  93%  of  the  in- 
cumbents, They  watch  the  exposes  of 
graft  on  TV  with  passive  frustration. 
They  are  annoyed  by  the  $500  billion 
savings  and  loan  fraud,  which 
Congress  abetted,  the  billions  stolen 
from  one  government  agency  after  an- 
other, the  billions  wasted  by  the  mili- 
tary, the  tousy  pedormance  of  the  post 
office,  our  schools,  our  health  care 
system,  and  our  inability  to  deal  with 
welfare,  crime,  drugs,  and  so  on.  But 
do  anything  about  it?  No  wayl 

In  amateur  radio  we  have  ihe  mind- 
less support  of  CW,  You're  just  lucky 
that  I  am  so  circumspect  about  what  l 
Ihink  and  don't  come  right  out  with  my 
opinion.  Yes,  I  know  all  the  rationaliza- 
tions for  CW.  I've  been  hamming  for 
over  50  years,  so  you  have  no  news 
for  me.  Yes,  I  know  CW  is  fun,  I  never 
said  it  wasn't.  And  yes,  I  know  you  feel

From  the  Harnshack 


Dan  Sealy  AA70A,  Astoria  OR 

W&ynet  I  have  been  reading  your  edi- 
torials and  responses  to  our  letters  (or 
some  time,  and  now  I  think  It's  time  to 
respond. 

I  usually  agree  wflh  you  on  most  is- 
sues. I  would,  however,  like  to  give 
you  my  two  cents  worth. 

First,  I  don't  agree  with  your  con- 
stant lambasting  of  the  ARRL  Almost 
every  73  issue  has  something  bad  to 
say  about  that  organization.  Most 
GST's  don't  even  mention  7a  Now,  I 
don't  for  a  moment  believe  that  the 
ARRL  is  fairly  and  equally  represent- 
ing the  interests  ol  amateur  radio,  nor 
do  I  blindly  agree  with  much  of  their 
policy.  I  do  think  that  theirs  is  a  case 
of  absolute  power  corrupted  absolute- 
ly, I  am  a  member  of  Ihe  ARRL  not 
because  I  swallow  everything  the  or- 
ganization says  and  does  without 
question H  but  because  J  at  least  want 
to  have  a  vote  in  how  the  organization 
evolves,  My  vole  may  count  very  little 
in  the  ARRL  scheme  of  things,  but  at 
feast  I  have  the  right  to  complain. 

For  example,  you  frequently  write 
of  the  failure  of  the  Incentive  licens- 
ing" program,  I  don't  think  that  it  has 
failed  at  all.  I  don't  think  that  it  is  as 
much  of  a  success  as  the  ARRL 
would  like  everyone  to  believe,  but  the 
system  does  work.  I  have  been  a  ham 
for  just  under  two  years.  When  I  start- 
ed, I  earned  my  Technician  with  HF  li- 
cense. As  my  involvement  with  ama- 
teur radio  grew,  I  came  to  realize  that 
the  real  ticket  to  amateur  radio  was 
access  to  me  HF  bands  (at  least  for 
now}.  The  incentive  to  upgrade  was 
real  and  compelling. 

I  have  no  problem  with  a  class  sys- 
tem for  the  licenses.  If  someone 
wants  to  be  able  to  use  a  particular 
frequency,  then  work  a  fittfe  and  get 
the  appropriate  license.  It  isn't  that 
hard-  You  have  said  in  many  editorials 
that  there  is  a  great  big  world  out 
there  just  waiting  for  some  en- 
trepreneur to  come  along  and  reap 
the  harvest.  I  don't  think  that  you 
meant  that  one  doesn't  need  to  work 
to  achieve  those  rewards.  The  world 
today  includes  loo  many  who  believe 
that  the  world  owes  them  a  living,  and 
that  It  isn't  necessary  to  work  for  what 
you  want 

You  constantly  write  about  the 
elimination  of  CW  in  favor  of  the  mod- 
ern digital  modes.  Why?  What  is 
wrong  with  CW?  if  it  serves  no  other 
purpose  than  a  "rite-of -passage."  so 
be  rt  There  isn't  anything  wrong  with 
that.  Almost  everything  we  do  has 
some  form  of  the  rite-of- passage: 
work,  school,  sports  and  others.  Few 
people  start  out  in  the  job  market  as 
supervisors  or  managers.  We  work  for 
it.  The  old-timers  usually  watch  the 
new  kids  do  the  dirty  "grunt"  work.  We 
work  hard  to  graduate  from  school. 

6  73  Amateur  Radio  Today  *  May,  1 


Along  the  way  we  might  learn  old, 
outdated  material  that  serves  no 
immediate  purpose.  The  new  player 
on  the  football  team  usually  warms 
the  bench  for  the  more  experienced 
players. 

I  have  come  to  appreciate  GW  as 
another  mode,  but  I  don't  think  it  is  the 
"end-all,"  "be-aJI"  of  amateur  radio. 
Sure,  it's  old,  but  so  are  Model  T's 
and  antique  airplanes,  and  I  know 
several  who  would  pay  dearly  for 
both.  It  isn't  fast  but  It  is  reliable.  You 
don't  need  a  $5Gf>to-$5,000  comput- 
er, TNG,  and  radio  to  make  it  work, 
You  can  gel  on  the  air  for  very,  very 
iitUe  money,  and  communicate  aH  over 
the  world, 

Finally,  your  statement  in  the 
February  issue  that  amateur  radio  *is 
a  government  sponsored  entertain- 
ment medium"  is  probably  true,  but 
the  part  about  our  frequencies  being 
worth  "tens  of  billions  of  dollars"  is 
false.  Sure,  some  of  our  frequencies 
(mainly  above  6  meters)  are  valuable 
to  commercial  interests  but,  with  the 
exception  of  shortwave  broadcast  sta- 
tions, no  other  commercial  interest 
would  put  up  with  the  uncertainties  of 
propagation,  fading,  solar  flares,  and 
other  conditions  which  make  HF  only 
fairly  reliable.  Besides,  as  you  Stated, 
the  advent  of  cellular  telephones  has 
made  our  frequencies  even  less  valu- 
able to  commercial  interests  as  a 
communication  medium. 

By  the  way.  73  is  the  only  amateur 
radio  magazine  I  subscribe  to,  other 
than  receiving  QST  as  part  of  my 
^membership' 

Pan,  your  memory  is  in  trouble. 
There's  tittle  connection  between  the 
1964  incentive  Licensing  debacle, 
when  the  ARRL  destroyed  the  entire 
American  amateur  radio  manufactur- 
ing industry,  and  the  current  licensing 
system.  Your  memory  is  also  in  trou- 
ble on  GWt  whkfi  I've  never  proposed 
eliminating,  I've  atways  been  a  cham- 
pion of  using  CW  for  fun.  You  sure 
have  a  way  of  thinking  in  terms  of 
straw  men  and  then  demolishing 
them.  I  never  suggested  our  HF  fre- 
quencies are  worth  billions*  Millions, 
yes.  IVs  our  completely  unused  mi- 
crowave allocations  that  are  priceless, 
as  I've  emphasized  many  times 
. . .  Wayne 

David  J.  DICenso  WB1CDG  I 
have  been  reading  your  magazine  for 
years  (since  about  1978).  I  have  been 
pleased  at  the  consistency  of  the 
magazine  and  the  enthusiasm  about 
the  hobby  that  is  evident  in  the  pages 
of  73. 

The  most  useful  and  exciting  col- 
umn that  you  have  offered  is  Mike 
Bryce's  "QRP"  column,  That  column  is 
the  first  one  that  I  turn  to  when  I  pick 

993 


up  your  magazine.  Thanks  to  Mike 
Bryce's  column,  I  have  dusted  off  my 
soldering  iron  and  have  become  an 
active  builder  again.  His  column's 
schematics  and  information  are 
always  usefuJ  and  very  helpful.  Often 
when  I  discard  old  issues  of  73, 
I  make  it  a  point  to  save  the  *QRP" 
column. 

Randall  M,  VanVoorhis  KD4DWE 

Killeen  TX  Several  months  ago  you 
printed  a  letter  of  mine  mentioning  a 
questionable  hard-core  push  for  inter- 
esting newcomers  in  the  hobby.  The 
letter  got  many  responses,  from  "Why 
did  you  go  and  give  our  dub  a  bad 
rep?"  to  "Pretty  good,"  and  "Not  bad." 

Since  then  I  have  joined  the  Air 
Force  and  moved  from  Memphis  lo 
KiMeenf  Texas  (aka  Ft.  Hood  Army  In- 
stallation). Upon  my  arrival  in  Killeen  I 
turned  on  my  radio  and  put  out  a  call 
and  was  immediately  greeted  by 
Frank  N2HNU.  After  speaking  for  a 
while,  we  exchanged  73s  and  QRTd. 
Later  that  evening,  having  received  a 
Poor  Man's  Packet  modem  from  a 
friend  back  in  Memphis,  I  tried  to  get 
on  the  air.  Because  I  had  no  prior 
packet  experience  I  gave  Frank  a 
quick  call  to  ask  some  questions.  Al- 
ter he  spent  almost  an  hour  trying  to 
help  me  over  the  phone,  he  gave  me 
the  number  of  the  local  packet  guru. 
Both  calls  were  toll  calls. 

We  finally  got  my  station  up  and 
running.  After  several  packet  contacts 
I  ended  up  on  voice  with  three  "local" 
hams.  We  chatted  and  I  got  to  know 
about  them  and  the  area  and  they  got 
to  know  a  bit  about  me.  These  con- 
tacts resulted  in  my  getting  to  know 
some  of  the  locals,  becoming  familiar 
with  the  different  repeaters,  and  re- 
ceiving an  invitation  to  join  the  Temple 
ARC. 

This  is  another  fine  example  of  the 
hospitality  mat  makes  me  like  to  asso- 
ciate with  hams.  1  Still  have  only  my 
No-Code  Tech  license,  I  guess  ill  get 
your  20+  wpm  tape  and  upgrade,  It's 
not  that  far  to  Extra. 

I  am  a  big  W2NSD  fan  and  support 
you  100%.  I  make  a  point  of  mention- 
ing 73  every  time  I  contact  one  of  your 
advertisers  and  for  your  new  advertis- 
ers. I  usually  circle  their  Reader  Ser- 
vice number  and,  of  course,  in  any 
further  contacts  73  is  mentioned. 

Your  point  about  the  audit  is  a  very 
valid  one  and  I  hope  the  advertisers 
do  take  note  of  your  outcome  and  re- 
quest an  audit  of  the  other  publica- 
tions they  may  advertise  in. 

Being  in  a  big  state  like  Texas  and 
close  to  several  "major  cities,  I  was 
wondering  if  you  have  any  plans  to  at- 
tend a  hamfesl  so  that  I  can  meet  you 
tace  to  face  and  shake  your  hand  for 
all  of  the  excellent  work  you  are  do- 
ing, not  only  in  ham  radio  but  also  in 
the  circus  ring  called  politics. 

Randall,  t  hope  your  last  letter  got 
those  cretins  lo  stop  and  think  about 
their  antisocial  behavior.  We  don't 
need  hams  like  that 

Texas?  I  don't  remember  anyone 
asking  me  lo  come  down  for  a  ham- 


fest  recently  Oh,  I  don't  blame  'err, 
,  .  .  I'm  probably  pretty  dull  these 
days,  more  interested  in  talking  abou, 
getting  our  country  fixed  than  in  ama- 
teur radio  minutia  .  *  .  even  though  a 
big  part  of  my  proposals  entail  gener- 
ating a  million  or  two  new  young  hams 
. . .  Wayne 

Chet  Smith  WB2LUQ.  Verona  NY 
1347B  I  want  to  state  that  I.  for  one. 
think  the  space  utilized  in  73  for  your 
editorials  is  put  to  good  use.  I've 
gotten  many  a  good  laugh  out  of 
some  of  the  responses  to  your  ob- 
servations. There  are,  naturally,  some 
of  your  views  that  I  disagree  with.  For 
instance,  the  Idea  that  everyone  who 
is  anyone  should  have  more  than  ad- 
equate  supplies  of  cash  to  pursue  any 
and  all  aspects  of  amateur  radio. 
Also,  your  less  than  enthusiastic  view 
on  the  issue  of  AM  operation.  Actual- 
ly. I  see  these  two  points  as  some- 
what related.  When  I  started  out, 
I  was  still  in  high  school  and  cash 
supplies  were  limited,  to  say  the  least. 
So  I  went  ahead  and  got  my  Novice 
license,  and  got  on  the  air  with  a  used 
rig  thai  did  have  facilities  for  AM  oper- 
ation. So,  not  surprisingly,  when  I 
upgraded  some  months  later  I  was 
able  to.  and  did.  get  on  AM.  There 
were  some  local  guys  here  who 
were  on  so  we  did  make  a  go  of  it. 
No,  I'm  not  on  at  present,  but  I  do 
have  an  old  Heath  Apache/Mohawk 
combination  that  I  fully  plan  to  get 
on  with  good  audio,  as  far  as  I  can 
tell.  And  most  AM  stays  on  or  near 
certain  agreed  frequencies,  much  like 
RTTV  ops  and  other  alternate  mode 
operators.  I  simply  think  that  not 
everybody  necessarily  has  a  couple 
of  thousand  dollars  floating  around  to 
use  in  pursuit  of  their  hobby.  \  certain- 
ly wasn't  in  that  category  when  I  start- 
ed out,  and  I'm  sure  I  wasn't  the  only 
one- 

There's  a  lot  of  truth  in  what  you've 
mentioned  from  time  to  time  about  op- 
erating from  the  other  end,  getting  on 
from  other  countries.  I  came  back 
from  over  four  years  in  the  Marshalis 
a  lew  months  agoT  so  I  have  been  ex* 
perienced  in  that  regard.  There  are  all 
kinds  of  different  dubs  on  the  island, 
but  KX6BU  (Kwajaletn  Amateur  Radio 
Club,  now  V7BAX)  is  the  oldest  estab- 
lished  club  there,  and  had  its  origins 
soon  after  WWII  ended. 

Over  the  years  I've  had  some  inter- 
esting experiences  operating  at  some 
other  club  stations'  facilities.  When  I 
was  in  the  Navy  (from  1981  to  1987)  I 
was  fortunate  to  be  able  to  operate 
from  K9NBR  and  later  from  WA4ECY. 
The  club  at  K9NBH  was  pretty  much 
do  fund,  but  ECY  was  a  pretty  active 
group.  To  get  back  to  one  of  your 
points,  though,  I  am  sure  that  reviving 
club  stations  at  high  schools  and  col- 
leges would  help  immensely,  not  only 
in  getting  more  hams,  but  also  in  help- 
ing us  with  our  sad  deficiency  in 
American  engineers  and  techs,  I  know 
that  I'm  not  alone  In  saying  that  I 
would  have  enjoyed  school  a  whole 
lot  more  if  we  could  have  had  some 
sort  of  facility  at  the  school.

Unlicensed  Ham  Operator 
Heading  Back  to  Prison 

The  only  amateur  radio  operator  ever  to  be 
imprisoned  for  illegally  transmitting  on  ham  ra- 
dio is  headed  back  to  the  pokey.  Richard  A. 
Burton,  46,  of  Harbor  City,  California,  was  sen- 
tenced 10  prison  on  Monday,  February  22,  for 
talking  on  his  2  meter  radio  without  a  license. 
He  used  to  be  WB6JAC. 

Burton  has  a  long  history  of  repeated  ama- 
teur radio  violations  going  back  more  than  a 
decade.  The  FCC  initially  revoked  Burton's  ham 
ticket  in  1981,  but  that  didn't  keep  him  off  the 
amateur  air  waves.  A  1984  federal  court  found 
him  guilty  ol  transmitting  on  the  ham  bands 
without  a  license  .  .  .  and  using  obscene  lan- 
guage. 

The  obscenity  charge  was  later  overturned 
but  the  license  revocation  continued.  He  was 
sentenced  to  a  four-year  federal  prison  sen- 
tence which  was  later  reduced  to  six  months,  to 
be  followed  by  a  five-year  probationary  period. 
He  served  the  sentence  at  the  Lompoc  (Califor- 
nia) federal  detention  facility;  the  probation  was 
over  in  t&89.  In  1990,  Burton  was  once  again 
monitored  on  the  2  meter  band  and  convicted  of 
operating  without  a  license.  This  time  he  was 
ordered  to  undergo  therapy. 

Last  summer,  Burton  was  again  cited  for 
making  several  illegal  unidentified  2  meter  ham 
radio  transmissions  after  the  Los  Angeles  FCC 
Office  tracked  his  broadcasts  to  a  Redondo 
Beach  address.  He  pleaded  innocent  and  was 
ordered  to  return  to  federal  district  court  for  jury 
trial  last  November, 

On  December  1,  1993,  Richard  Burton  was 
convicted  on  all  lour  counts  of  operating  an  am- 
ateur radio  station  without  a  license.  This  was 
his  third  conviction.  He  could  have  received  up 
to  a  two-year  prison  sentence  and  a  $10,000 
fine. 

After  the  prison  sentence,  Burton  must  un- 
dergo psychological  counseling  and  perform 
500  hours  of  community  service,  Los  Angeles 
Times  writer  Bob  Pool  quoted  Burton  as  saying, 
"I  think  I  need  to  get  myself  another  hobby," 
TNX  W5YI  Report,  Vol.  15  Issue  #6,  March  15

Fake  Distress  Calls 

As  part  of  a  plea  bargain  arrangement.  Jorge 
Mestre  NS3K  of  Fairfax,  Virginia,  has  surren- 
dered his  amateur  Extra  class  license  and  must 
dispose  of  his  ham  radio  equipment  within  60 
days.  Mestre  pled  guilty  to  willfully  making  fabri- 
cated 20  meter  distress  calls  last  summer  on 
14.313  MHz.  The  SOS  supposedly  involved  a 
sinking  ship  located  in  the  West  indies.  Ham 
operators  notified  the  Coast  Guard  and  the 
FCC.  The  massive  search  and  rescue  effort 
cost  the  Coast  Guard  more  than  $10Qt000, 
Mestre  has  agreed  to  make  $50,000  in  restitu- 
tion. 

The  prank  distress  calls  were  traced  to 
Mestre  through  the  efforts  of  the  FCCTs  long- 
range  direction  finding  network,  computer  anal- 


ysis of  tape  recordings,  and  "signature  print" 
comparison  tests  on  Mestre's  equipment,  which 
was  later  seized  on  a  federal  search  warrant. 
He  will  be  sentenced  on  May  7th  and  faces  six 
years  in  prison  and  a  $250,000  fine.  TNX  W5Yt

TV  Series  Coordinated  on 
the  Ham  Bands— Produc- 
ers Leased  Radios  From 
Commercial  Firm 


During  mid-February,  a  Fort  Worth,  Texas, 
amateur  scanning  the  amateur  420  MHz  ham 
band  came  across  transmissions  that  didn't 
sound  like  ham  radio.  They  sounded  like 
unidentified  business  communications.  He 
called  the  FCC  and  retransmitted  the  signals 
over  a  local  repeater  so  the  FCC  in  Dallas  could 
hear  them.  An  engineer  was  later  dispatched  to 
Fort  Worth  to  investigate.  The  operation  was  lo- 
cated through  close-in  direction  finding  tech- 
niques. 

It  turned  out  that  Cannon  Television,  Inc.,  of 
Irving,  Texas,  and  a  West-Coast-based  televi- 
sion crew  had  rented  36  Motorola  P-200  hand- 
held radios  to  direct  operations  for  "Walker, 
Texas  Ranger— a  television  series  being  pro- 
duced in  downtown  Fort  Worth,  starring  actor 
Chuck  Morris,  The  problem  was  that  the  radios 
were  apparently  unlicensed  and  were  pro- 
grammed to  operate  on  443,0125  MHz  and  frve 
other  nearby  frequencies  in  the  70  cm  ham 
band. 

The  Dallas  FCC  Field  Office  issued  a  Notice 
of  Apparent  Liability  for  Forfeiture  (an  FCC  ad* 
ministraiive  fine)  in  the  amount  of  $8,000 
against  Cannon  Television,  Inc.,  for  operating 
unlicensed  radio  stations. 

The  radios  were  apparently  labeled  with  the 
proper  business  band  channels  but  were  pro- 
grammed to  operate  on  the  ham  bands  in  be* 
tween  simplex  70  cm  frequencies.  The  televi- 
sion series'  producer,  Bob  Hargrove,  said  he 
knew  nothing  about  the  legalities  of  "radio* — on- 
ly that  he  routinely  rents  them  all  over  the  Unit- 
ed States  for  shooting  on  location.  "We  had 
someone  fly  in  from  Houston  that  night  to  repro- 
gram  the  radios,"  he  said,  "Delt  Communica- 
tions (the  Houston  company  that  rented  out  the 
radios)  is  also  confused  as  to  what  went  wrong.

FCC  Issues  $10,500  Fine 
for  Malicious  Interference 

The  FCC  has  handed  a  ham  a  record 
S10r500  Notice  of  Apparent  Liability  to  Mone- 
tary Forfeiture.  The  fine  was  issued  to  Richard 
L  Whiten  WB20TK  of  Taylors,  South  Carolina, 
for  what  the  FCC  called  "malicious  interference 
to  the  communications  of  other  ham  radio  oper- 
ators" The  operators  the  FCC  says  Whiten  in- 


terfered with  are  Michael  Galego  KA4MUJ  of  Ft, 
Lauderdate,  Florida,  and  Judith  Duehring 
KA1SKV  of  Maynard,  Massachusetts.  Galego 
and  Duehring  are  publicly  avowed  followers  of 
the  anti- service  net  "Better  Amateur  Radio  Fed- 
eration," headed  up  by  convicted  felon  Herbert 
L  Schoenbohm  KV4FZ, 

The  FCCTs  Kingsville,  Texas,  office  says  it 
monitored  and  recorded  a  conversation  on  the 
frequency  of  14.314.7  MHz  on  September  26, 
1992.  According  to  the  January  19th  NAL, 
Whiten  did  not  dispute  making  the  cited  trans- 
missions but  did  deny  that  they  "constituted  will- 
ful and  malicious  interference.™  Whiten  told  the 
FCC  that,  If  [he]  had  truly  wanted  to  willfully 
and  maliciously  interfere  [he]  could  have  done 
so  to  such  an  extent  that  communications  be- 
tween other  amateur  radio  operators  would 
have  been  impossible." 

But  the  FCC  EngineeHn-Charge  Oliver  K, 
Long,  who  issued  the  fine,  looked  at  this  as  a 
simple  case  of  Whiten  interfering  with  other  am- 
ateur communications,  that  Whiten  has  in  writ- 
ing admitted  his  guill  and  that  he  therefore  is 
subject  to  the  administrative  penalty  as  pre- 
scribed. The  notice  says  that  the  base  amount 
of  the  fine  is  $7,000  but  that  it  has  been  adjust- 
ed upward  another  $3,500  dollars  because  of 
what  EIC  Long  says  is  Whiten's  "repeated  viola- 
tion Of  rule  97.101(D)* 

The  FCC  gave  Whiten  30  days  (from  January 
19)  to  either  pay  the  fine  or  file  a  petition  for  re- 
duction or  non- imposition  of  the  penalty.  In  a 
telephone  interview  on  January  24th,  WB20TK 
told  the  Amateur  Radio  Newsline  that  he  has  no 
intention  of  paying  the  forfeiture  and  plans  to 
hire  a  Washington,  DC,  attorney  who  special- 
izes in  communications  law  to  fight  the  matter 
through  the  administrative  appeafs  process,  and 
if  needed,  into  the  federal  court  system,  TNX

More  Fines  for  Malicious 
Interference 


The  FCC  has  issued  another  Notice  of  Ap- 
parent Liability,  this  time  for  $2,000  against 
William  A.  Moskowitz  KA3HSZ  of  Ptano,  Texas. 

The  FCC's  Vero  Beach,  Florida,  office  issued 
the  notice  on  January  14  after  having  monitored 
Moskowitz  on  November  26th  of  last  year.  The 
NAL  says  that  during  a  17-minute  period,  the 
government  observed  him  changing  operating 
frequency  twice  in  the  vicinity  of  14.313  MHz, 
In  order  to  interfere  with  ongoing  communica- 
tions." 

The  violation  was  willful,"  the  FCC  said. 

The  public  notice  also  said  that  the  Commis- 
sion is  "treating  this  as  a  minor  violation."  Since 
Moskowitz  is  an  individual,  because  of  the  na- 
ture of  the  violation,  and  because  it  is  a  first  of- 
fense, the  Commission  set  the  fine  at  $2,000. 
The  FCC's  base  forfeiture  for  malicious  interfer- 
ence is  $7,000, 

Moskowitz  has  the  usual  30  days  to  pay  the 
fine  or  appeal  it.  TNX  Westfink  Report,  Number

The  Hows  and  Whys  of 

Coaxial  Cable 

How  to  select  the  most  appropriate  kind  for  your  need 


by  Steve  Katz  WB2W1K/6 


Hams  have  used  coaxial  cable  for  trans- 
mission  lines  almost  since  its  invention 
nearly  50  years  ago,  but  many  don't  know 
why  or  how  this  trend  started.  Although 
much  has  been  written  on  the  subject,  I'm 
frequently  startled  to  hear  so  much  misinfor- 
mation chatted  about  on  the  ham  bands,  even 
by  old-timers  who  should  know  better  Per- 
haps this  article  will  help  newcomers  and 
old-timers  alike  clear  up  misconceptions  and 
make  more  educated  decisions  regarding  this 
important  piece  of  station  apparatus. 

Why  Coax? 

Why  do  we  use  coaxw  and  why  is  most  of  it 
50  ohms  nominal  impedance? 

This  is  the  best  question  anyone  can  ask. 
Before  there  was  coaxial  cable,  amateurs  and 
professionals  alike  used  primarily  open-wire 
transmission  lines,  typically  in  the  300  to 
600  ohm  nominal  impedance  range.  Some- 
times they  used  no  transmission  line  at  all — 
they  just  directly  fed  antennas  with  a  single 
piece  of  wire.  In  the  latter  arrangement,  the 
conned  ion  wire  became  pan  of  the  antenna 
system  itself,  and  radiated  along  with  the  an- 
tenna. The  drawback  to  this  scheme  was  that 
the  connecting  wire's  orientation  would  play 
a  critical  role  in  antenna  performance,  and 
often  a  high-vohage  point  would  appear  right 
at  the  antenna  connection  to  the  transmitter, 
creating  both  RF  interference  and  even  pos- 
sibly fire  hazards  when  the  wire  would  come 
in  proximity  to  combustible  materials. 

Open-wire  "balanced  feeders11  helped 
solve  some  of  these  problems.  Because  the 
currents  in  the  feeder  wires  were  balanced 
(assuming  a  well-balanced  load,  or  antenna), 
feedline  radiation  was  minimized  and  the  RF 
field  contained  to  a  very  small  area  around 
the  wires.  By  orienting  the  feeders  perpen- 
dicular to  the  intended  antenna  field,  antenna 
radiation  pattern  distortion  would  also  be 
minimized  and  antennas  could  be  bener  opti- 
mized. Open- wire  "balanced  feeders"  were 
also  a  natural  for  connecting  vacuum-tube 
push-pull  amplifier  circuits  to  balanced  an- 
tennas without  the  need  for  complex  match- 
ing networks,  Tube  amplifiers  are  normally 
high-impedance  devices  whose  output

impedance  is  roughly  equivalent  lo  the  plate 
voltage  divided  by  the  plate  current  of  the 
output  stage.  Thus,  a  tube  amplifier  with 
1 ,000  volts  on  the  anode,  drawing  500  mA 
anode  current  (this  is  a  500  watt  stage), 
would  have  a  plate  load  impedance  of  about 
2,000  ohms.  Matching  2,000  ohms  to  a  600 
ohm  open-wire  feeder  connected  to  a  600 
ohm  balanced  antenna  required  only  a  trans- 
formation ratio  of  2000:600,  or  3J3:lt 
which  was  easily  achieved  by  a  very  simple, 
low-loss  "link  output"  circuit. 
The  problem  with  open-wire  lines,  and 

"Coaxial  cable  solves  a  great 
number  of  problems  and  that  is 
why  it  is  used  so  universally  in 
amateur  as  well  as  non-amateur 

communications  systems.

"twin-lead,"  which  is  identical  to  open-wire 

except  thai  the  dielectric  (spacer  insulation} 
is  a  continuous  strip  of  material  (such  as 
polyethylene),  is  that  they  are  adversely 
affected  by  conducting  objects  in  close 
proximity  to  them.  They  cannot  be  taped  or 
otherwise  directly  attached  to  metal  towers, 
masts  or  antenna  booms,  and  even  water, 
snow  or  ice  laying  on  them  dramatically 
increases  their  losses.  Twin-lead  and  open- 
wire  fcedlincs  must  be  carefully  insulated 
and  spaced  from  all  surrounding  objects  and 
cannot  be  directly  buried  beneath  the  earth. 
Besides  all  this,  they  stiJl  radiate  to  some 
degree,  especially  if  terminated  in  any  kind 
of  unbalanced  load.  And,  although  the 
current  in  high-impedance  feedline  is  lower 
than  it  would  be  in  lower-impedance  (coax- 
ial) cable,  making  IR  (ohmic)  losses  lower, 
voltages  are  much  higher,  to  the  point  where 
exposure  to  living  organisms  (like  people!) 
can  be  deadly  hazardous.  For  example, 
if  someone  were  running  the  amateur  legal- 
limit  power  level  of  1,500  watts  PEP  out- 
put and  using  a  600  ohm  antenna  and  feed- 
line,  the  voltage  across  the  feedline  would 
be  948.68  volts  (calculated  by  the  for- 


mula:       E  _  V  P  x  R 

This  is  quite  a  lot  of  voltage  and  is  con- 
sidered by  all  authorities  to  be  extremely 
hazardous. 

Coaxial  cable  to  the  rescue!  Coaxial  cable 
is  self-shielding  and,  if  well-made,  does  not 
radiate  at  all  when  properly  terminated  in  a 
matched  load.  Since  the  outer  conductor 
(shield)  normally  operates  at  ground  poten- 
tial, coax  can  be  secured  to  all  sorts  of  ob- 
jects, including  tower  legs,  metal  masts  and 
booms,  and  almost  anything  else  that  comes 
to  mind,  making  its  installation  extremely 
uncritical.  If  the  coax  has  the  proper  outer 
jacket  material,  it  may  be  buried  beneath  the 
earth  for  many  years  without  degradation. 
Coax  is  unaffected  by  the  presence  of  water, 
snow  or  ice.  Although  the  nominal 
impedance  of  coax  is  lower  than  open  wire 
line  and  it  therefore  has  higher  IR  (ohmic) 
loss,  its  lower  impedance  allows  direct  pow- 
er transfer  to  low-impedance  antennas  (a 
half-wave  dipole  in  free  space,  for  example, 
looks  like  70  ohms)  and  keeps  the  voltage 
across  the  feedline  and  antenna  connection 
points  to  a  safer  level.  A  1,500  watt  PEP  out- 
put transmitter  connected  to  a  50  ohm  anten- 
na will  have  only  273-86  volts  across  the 
feedhne— still  a  somewhat  hazardous  level, 
but  about  one- fourth  that  obtained  using  a 
600  ohm  system.  Because  coaxial  cable's 
working  voltage  is  quite  low,  its  insulating 
dielectric  material  may  be  optimized  for 
minimal  loss,  rather  than  maximum  insula- 
tion resistance. 

Why  50  Ohms? 

Clearly,  coaxial  cable  solves  a  great  num- 
ber of  problems  and  that  is  why  it  is  used  so 
universally  in  amateur  as  well  as  non-ama- 
teur communications  systems. 

"Why  is  most  coaxial  cable  50  olims  nom- 
inal impedance?" 

This  can  best  be  answered  in  two  parts:  (a) 
Coax  isn't  ail  50  ohms,  but  commonly  runs 
from  30  ohms  to  90  ohms,  and  sometimes 
even  a  bit  higher  when  called  for.  Impedance 
selection  is  very  application-dependent,  (b) 
50  ohms  represents  an  excellent  compromise 
between  the  lowest  possible  transmission

loss,  which  occurs  at  70  ohms  nominal,  and 
the  highest  possible  power  handling  capabil- 
ity, which  occurs  at  30  ohms  nominal.  Be- 
cause of  these  factors,  50  ohms  was  settled 
on  as  the  best  all-around  impedance  for  the 
widest  variety  of  applications.  To  this  day, 
70  ohm  cable  is  used  almost  exclusively  in 
receive-only  applications  where  no  power 
transmission  is  required  (such  as  cable  TV 
systems). 

Cable  Specs 

If  50  ohm  coax  is  the  best  iking  to  use,  I 
guess  I  should  buy  a  big  roll  ofRG58IU  and 
use  it  everywhere,  isn't  that  right? 

Yes  and  no.  RG58/U  might  be  great  stuff, 
but  again,  most  choices  in  life  are  applica- 
tion-driven and  one  needs  to  consider  the 
specific  use  before  making  an  intelligent  ca- 
ble selection. 

First  of  all,  what  do  the  "RG"  numbers 
mean?  Well,  these  indicate  that  the  cable  is 
registered  (simply  a  matter  of  someone 
spending  the  money  and  filling  out  a  few 
forms).  Cables  which  are  truly  RG-XX-/U 
are  also  "mil-qualified,"  which  means  they 
are  certified  for  lot  compliance  with  MIL-C- 
I7D,  the  general  military  specification  for 
wire  and  cable,  and  manufactured  in  a  quali- 
fied facility*  The  two-  or  three-digit  number 
after  the  "RG"  prefix  means  absolutely  noth- 
ing by  itself:  You  need  to  refer  to  MIL-C- 
17D  to  see  exactly  what  the  cable  designator 
means.  The  numbers  are  arbitrarily  assigned 
in  numerical  order,  from  1  to  infinity,  and 
only  tend  to  indicate  the  age  of  the  product's 
registration.  For  example,  RG8/U  is  a  much 
older  product  than  RG213/U,  which  is  es- 
sentially identical  except  that  RG213/U  is  a 
QPL  (MIL-C-  \  7D  qualified)  product,  while 
the  older  RG8/U  no  longer  isT  having  been 
replaced  by  the  newer  part  number.  Many 
amateur  coaxial  products  are  not  mil-quali- 
fied at  all,  but  might  still  be  imprinted  and 
sold  as  "RG**  products.  Usually,  if  these  are 
identical  to  mil-spec  cables  but  arc  simply 
not  qualified,  they  will  be  labeled  with  the 
word  "TYPE"  after  the  part  number:  For  ex- 
ample, Belden  9913  is  "RG8  TYPE"  cable 
but  is  not  RG8/U.  Other  non-qualified  prod- 
ucts might  simply  leave  off  the  "/UH  suffix, 
such  as  "RG8X"  or  "RG8M"  mini-8  cable. 
Admittedly,  it's  all  a  bit  confusing. 

How  to  Choose 

Since  most  of  us  will  be  using  50  ohm  ca- 
bles in  our  stations,  the  most  important  pa- 
rameters to  consider  in  making  product 
choices  include:  (a)  transmission  loss;  (b) 
power  handling  capability;  (c)  flexibility;  td) 
availability  of  standard  and  reasonably- 
priced  connectors;  and  (e)  resistance  to 
weathering  and  ultraviolet  (UV)  exposure. 
These  parameters  vary  in  importance  and 
not  necessarily  in  the  order  I've  listed. 
Again,  the  selection  is  and  should  be  appli- 
cation-dependent Oh,  yes — I've  almost  for- 
gotten the  most  important  parameter  for 
many  hams:  COST! 

In  general  (but  not  always),  the  larger  di- 
ameter the  cable  is,  the  lower  its  loss  will  be 


at  any  given  frequency.  This  is  because  the 
leading  contributor  to  transmission  loss  is 
the  ohmic  resistance  of  the  conductors, 
which  are  usually  copper,  and  the  larger  the 
cross-section  the  conductors  have,  the  lower 
their  resistance  will  be.  But  if  loss  were 
based  on  conductor  size  and  ohmic  (DC)  re- 
sistance alone,  coaxial  cable  would  have  the 
same  loss  for  a  given  length  at  all  operating 
frequencies,  from  DC  to  microwaves.  That 
is  not  the  case. 

There  are  two  other  factors  that  enter  into 
the  RF  loss  equation  (and  they  do  not  apply 
to  DC  circuits).  One  is  a  property  called 
"skin  effect/*  which  assumes  that  AC  (and 
RF)  currents  will  flow  only  in  the  outermost 
surface  of  any  conductor  and  therefore  con- 
ductors could  be  hollow  (with  no  center  core 
at  all)  and  be  just  as  effective  as  solid  con- 
ductors for  any  given  diameter  The  other  is 
dielectric  (the  spacing  insulation  between 
the  center  and  outer  conductor)  loss,  which 
increases  directly  with  operating  frequency 
for  most  commonly  used  dielectric  materi- 
als, The  "skin  depth"  of  a  conductor  be- 
comes more  and  more  shallow  as  the  RF  fre- 

"Itpays  to  select  coaxial

available,  reasonably-priced 
connectors  that  will  fit 


n 


quency  is  increased,  meaning  that  a  more 
and  more  shallow  region  of  the  conductor  is 
used  as  we  work  our  way  up  the  spectrum. 
This  means  that  a  given  conductor  will  have 
loss  that  increases  with  frequency,  as  less 
and  less  of  the  conductor  is  actually  used. 

There  is  a  third  factor  that  applies  mostly 
to  flexible  coaxial  cables  (the  most-used 
kinds  in  ham  stations),  and  that  is  radiation 
loss,  which  also  increases  directly  with  fre- 
quency as  the  outer  conductor,  which  is 
made  of  braided  materials  to  add  flexibility, 
becomes  a  less  effective  shield  for  contain- 
ment of  RF  energy.  Solid  outer-conductor 
cables  (semi-rigid,  rigid,  "hardline,"  etc.) 
typically  don't  suffer  radiation  losses. 

The  bigger  the  cable  is  in  diameter,  the 
more  power  it  can  usually  handle,  since  the 
conductors  will  have  Jess  loss  and  thus  dissi- 
pate less  power  (generating  less  heal)  and 
the  insulating  materials  tend  to  be  thicker, 
too,  sustaining  higher  operating  voltages.  An 
exception  to  this  general  rule  are  the  Teflon 
dielectric  cables,  which  have  great  power 
handling  ability  even  when  small  in  overall 
diameter.  This  is  because  Teflon  can  with- 
stand much  greater  healing  than  normally- 
used  insulating  materials,  like  polyethylene, 
and  it  has  a  higher  dielectric  withstanding 
voltage  for  a  given  thickness.  This  is  not  to 
say  that  Teflon  cables  are  superior  to  stan- 
dard polyethylene  ones— they  are  not,  ex- 
cept as  regarding  power  handling  for  a  given 
diameter  In  general.  Teflon  cables  are  actu- 
ally inferior  to  standard  poly  ethylene- insu- 
lated coax  in  almost  all  other  respects  be- 


cause Teflon  has  a  high  dielectric  constant, 
creating  the  need  for  smaller  center  conduc- 
tor size  (for  a  given  nominal  impedance)  and 
increasing  dielectric  losses.  An  example  of 
Teflon  coax  is  RG400/U,  which  is  about  the 
same  size  as  RG58/U  but  wilt  withstand 
more  than  10  times  the  power;  however, 
RG400/U  actually  has  more  transmission 
loss  than  standard  RG58/U  and  costs  about 
10  times  as  much! 

Throughout  the  HF  spectrum,  hams  use 
"UHF"  or  "PL25911  type  connectors  almost 
exclusively  because  commercially-made 
gear  is  already  fitted  with  their  mating  re- 
ceptacles (S0239)  and  they  are  good,  high- 
power,  inexpensive  fittings  that  are  very  use- 
ful through  144  MHz  or  so.  However,  on 
220  MHz  and  above,  the  connector  of  choice 
is  the  Type  "N,"  which  has  a  variety  of  mili- 
tary designators,  mostly  UG21D/U,  The 
Type  "N"  connector  surely  costs  more  than 
the  "UHF"  PL259  type,  but  is  actually  easier 
to  install  and  is  a  far  superior  connector 
throughout  the  VHF/UHF/SHF  spectrum.  In 
fact,  some  Type  "N"  fittings  work  well 
through  12  GHz  (12,000  MHz)!  For  smaller 
cables,  both  PL259\s  with  appropriate  "re- 
ducers" (type  UG175/U  and  UG176/U  for 
RG58/U  and  RG8X  types),  Type  "N"  and 
"BNCs"  are  commonly  used*  BNCs  are  very 
good  fittings  through  the  UHF  and  SHF 
spectrum  and,  when  properly  installed,  have 
no  measurable  loss  at  i  GHz.  However,  be- 
cause of  their  mechanical  frailty  they  are 
best  used  with  small-diameter  cables  like 
RG58/U,  RG174/U  and  so  forth. 

In  any  case,  it  pays  to  select  coaxial  cable 
which  has  commonly-available,  reasonably- 
priced  connectors  that  will  fit,  or  you  may 
find  yourself  with  S5  worth  of  cable  that  will 
require  $200  worth  of  connectors  to  attach  to 
anything.  The  "standard"  ham  coaxial  lines 
(RG58,  RG8,  RG213,  even  RG217  and  RG  17 
for  those  with  the  budget  and  need  for  giant- 
sized  cables)  all  have  readily-available  and 
reasonably-priced  finings.  Probably  the  only 
caveats  in  the  market  are  "surplus"  cables 
which  cannot  be  readily  identified  and  ahard- 
line"  cables,  which  do  require  special  connec- 
tors that  can  sometimes  cost  a  small  fortune. 

Beware  of  double-shielded  coaxial  cables! 
These  are  often  found  on  the  surplus  market 
and,  while  ihcy  might  be  wonderful  in  many 
respects,  they  can  be  difficult  to  use,  to  flex, 
and  to  find  connectors  which  fit.  For  exam- 
ple, the  double-shielded  version  of  RG213/U 
is  RG2I4/IL  These  two  cables  have  exactly 
the  same  electrical  properties,  the  same 
transmission  loss,  and  so  forth,  but  the 
double-shielded  type  will  not  fit  a  con- 
ventional connector  which  is  intended  for 
single-shielded  cable.  Why  would  anyone 
want  double-shielded  cable?  For  very  spe- 
cific and  demanding  applications,  where  a 
few  dB  of  additional  shielding  is  very 
important.  Connections  within  full-duplex 
repeater  systems  come  to  mind  as  a  good 
application.  If  you  don't  own  a  repeater, 
there's  no  reason  I  can  think  of  to  use 
double-shielded  cable.  It*s  generally  more 
trouble  than  it's  worth.

Specific  Questions 

After  contemplating  alt  of  this  confusing 
information*  what  in  the  world  should  I  use 
to  feed  my  40  meter  dipolel 

Great  question  1  That's  getting  down  to 
specifics.  Unless  you  intend  to  run  the  legal 
power  limit  (1500  watis  PEP  output),  I'd 
usually  recommend  RG58C/U  (for  runs  up 
to  50*  long  and  power  levels  below  400 
waits  PEP)  or  RG8X  (for  runs  up  to  1 50' 
long  and  power  levels  below  1000  waits 
PEP).  These  are  both  very  flexible, 
lightweight  cables  which  will  exhibit  very 
low  loss  on  40  meters  in  the  lengths  I've 
specified,  and  their  only  restriction  will  be 
power  handling.  For  legal -limit  power,  I'd 
recommend  RG213/U,  which  is  heavier  and 
less  flexible,  but  will  withstand  1,500  watts 
all  day  long. 

Wlmt  about  feeding  my  2  meter  beaml 

Another  great,  specific  question.  The  only 
question  Fd  ask  in  reply  is,  "How  long  will 
your  feedline  need  to  be?" 

For  lengths  less  than  50  feet,  RG8X  is  a 
good,  general-purpose  cable  for  2  meter  use* 
A  50-foot  run  will  have  about  2  dB  loss, 
which  is  not  loo  much  for  most  applications 
(like  working  FM  repeaters  and  such),  but 
might  be  excessive  for  demanding  applica- 
tions like  SSB/CW  weak-signal  work  where 
every  dB  counts.  For  lengths  up  to  about 
100  feet,  RG2I3/U  is  a  great  choice.  It  will 
lose  about  2,4  dB  or  so  in  a  100*  run.  For 
lengths  beyond  100  feet,  or  for  more  de- 
manding applications,  Fd  recommend 
Belden  9913.  which  is  the  same  o,d,  (outside 
diameter)  as  RG213/U  but  has  somewhat 
lower  loss,  about  1.3  dB  per  100  feet  at  144 
MHz.  The  drawback  to  the  9913  is  that  it  is 
far  less  flexible  than  RG213/U  and  does  not 
fit  a  standard  Type  "N"  connector;  however, 
special  connectors  for  9913  are  available 
and  don't  cost  much  more  than  the  standard 
ones.  For  very  long  runs,  or  highly  demand- 
ing applications  like  EME  (moonbounce, 
where  every  tenth  of  a  dB  starts  to  count)  or 
full-duplex  repeater  installations,  1/2"  or 
larger  "hardline"  or  Heliax  is  most  common- 
ly used 

Vd  like  to  use  a  single  feedline  to  connect 
my  146,  222  and  440  MHz  FM  antennas  at 
home,  using  a  "duplexed*  at  each  end  of  the 
line  to  separate  the  signals.  Any  problems 
with  that?  What  should  I  use? 

There's  no  problem  doing  this,  as  long  as 
you  use  high-quality  "duplexers"  (I'd  prefer 
to  call  them  signal-splitters,  which  is  what 
they  really  are)  on  both  ends,  and  remember 
to  make  the  topside  one,  which  will  be  ex- 
posed to  weather,  very  waterproof  There  are 
some  muttiband  signal-splitters  on  the  mar- 
ket which  have  almost  immeasurably  low 
loss  (less  than  0,5  dB)  and  will  handle  150 
watts  or  so.  Since  you  intend  to  use  the  coax 
on  440  MHz,  where  losses  will  be  the  high- 
est, I'd  recommend  RG213/U  for  short  runs 
up  to  50  feet  or  so,  then  Belden  9913  up  to 
100  feci,  then  commercial  "hardline"  or  He- 
liax for  runs  longer  than  100  feet  Bear  in 
mind  that  the  "hardline"  types  cannot  take 
repeated  flexing,  are  quite  inflexible  to  be- 


gin with,  and  require  specialized,  costly  con- 
nectors* But  properly  used,  it's  great  stuff. 

/  have  a  10-15-20  meter  triband  beam  on 
a  70-foot  tower  located  ISO  feet  behind  my 
house.  What  do  you  recommend  for  coax  to 
feed  this  system? 

Vd  probably  recommend  RG217/U  or 
RG17/U  in  this  casef  and  Fd  bury  it  under- 
ground to  get  to  the  base  of  the  tower.  It  will 
have  minimal  loss  and  is  very  high  quality 
cable.  Connectors  are  readily  available  (al- 
though they  have  a  larger  back  end  than  con- 
nectors for  RG8 -sized  cables  and  are  not  in- 
terchangeable), at  least  for  Type  N,  and 
adapters  can  be  used  to  mate  with  UHF  fit* 
tings  if  necessary.  Of  course,  you  could  save 
a  lot  of  money  by  using  standard  RG213/U, 
but  since  youTI  need  nearly  250  feet  of  it, 
this  stuff  will  begin  to  gel  lossy  at  28  MHz. 
It's  a  matter  of  balancing  your  appetite 
for  performance  against  your  budget  and  try- 
ing to  make  the  most  educated  decision 
possible. 

"Properly -installed  coaxial 

connectors  have  losses  too 

low  to  measure  if  they  are  used 

in  the  spectrum  for  which 

they  were  intended. 

fve  heard  that  coax  connectors  all  have 
loss,  and  every  time  you  use  onet  you're  giv- 
ing up  a  dB  or  so,  fs  this  true? 

Not  at  all!  Where  in  the  world  did  you 
hear  this  gibberish?  While  everything  has 
some  loss  in  this  imperfect  world,  properly- 
installed  coaxial  connectors  have  losses  too 
low  to  measure,  even  with  the  world's  most 
sophisticated  laboratory  equipment,  if  they 
are  used  in  The  spectrum  for  which  they  were 
intended. 

A  "UHFT  connector,  say  type  PL259ST, 
which  implies  a  silver-plated  connector  with 
a  Teflon  dielectric  (the  best  kind  to  use  be- 
cause they  solder  so  easily  and  resist  solder- 
ing heat  so  well),  used  at  28  MHz  will  have 
less  than  0.01  dB  insertion  loss  when  mated 
to  an  equivalent  receptacle.  Similarly,  a 
UG21D/U  Type  "N"  connector,  properly  in- 
stalled and  mated  to  its  equivalent  recepta- 
cle, will  exhibit  less  than  0,05  dB  loss  at  500 
MHz!  This  a  whale  of  a  lot  less  than  1  dB 
loss.  The  problem  is,  many  amateurs  don't 
know  how  to  install  connectors  properly, 
and  probably  do  end  up  with  more  loss  than 
there  should  be.  But  I  dB  is  an  awful  lot  to 
lose,  especially  at  the  lower  frequencies, 
where  simply  twisting  the  coax  conductors 
together  in  a  "mid-air"  splice  and  using  no 
connectors  at  all  will  usually  result  in  far 
less  than  l  dB  loss. 

Probably  the  worst  misapplication  of  RF 
connectors  is  when  hams  try  to  use  MUHF" 
PL259  types  at  440  MHz.  Most  of  them 
don't  work  very  well  at  this  frequency,  and 
losses  may  be  as  high  as  0.5  dB  per  connec- 
tor or  so  if  you're  not  careful.  At  440  MHz 
and  above  stick  with  the  time-proven,  con- 


stant-impedance Type  N  fittings. 

My  220  MHz  "mag  mount"  whip  antentia 
came  with  RGI74/U  coax  installed,  about 
10  feet  of  it.  Is  this  lossy?  Should  I  replace 
it? 

At  222  MHz,  10  feet  or  RG174/U  will 
lose  about  1.3  dB  or  so.  Replacing  it  with  an 
identical  length  of  RG8X  will  only  lose  0J 
dB,  so  you'd  pick  up  about  0,8  dB  by  mak- 
ing the  change. 

Wimt  about  the  coax  sold  by  Radio  Shack 
and  similar  retail  outlets?  Is  it  any  good? 

It  can  be,  but  it  might  not  be.  I  don't  mean 
to  disparage  Radio  Shack  or  anyone  else,  but 
the  problem  with  commercial*  non-military 
cables  is  the  lack  of  consistent  quality.  Since 
their  cables  are  manufactured  in  non-quali- 
fied facilities  and  each  lot  does  not  undergo 
the  rigors  of  considerable  Quality  Confor- 
mance Inspections,  many  limes  these  prod- 
ucts are  less  than  desirable,  especially  for 
long-term  installations.  Vd  not  hesitate  to 
use  their  stuff  for  patch  cables  around  the 
shack,  or  for  mobile  installations  and  other 
non-critical  applications  where  the  cable  can 
easily  be  replaced.  But  for  more  demanding 
applications  or  installations  where  replace- 
ment might  be  very  difficult,  Td  stick  with 
the  real  mil-spec  products,  or  at  least  try  to 
find  the  highest  quality  commercial  products 
available.  Shop  around  a  bit.  looking  not  on- 
ly at  the  price,  but  also  at  the  product  itself. 
Is  the  braid  coverage  very  good  (at  least 
95%  of  the  dielectric  should  be  covered  by 
the  braid,  with  no  visible  "holes'*  between 
the  strands)?  Is  the  outer  jacket  14UV  stabi- 
lized" (that  is,  will  it  withstand  continued  ul- 
traviolet radiation  from  the  sun  without  con- 
taminating the  cable)?  Is  the  run  you  intend 
to  use  free  of  splices  under  the  jacket  (usual- 
ly visible  as  a  small  bump  in  the  cable  diam- 
eter)? If  everything  looks  great*  use  it!  If 
not,  look  elsewhere. 

What  about  "foam1'  cables  versus  "non- 
foam?"  What's  the  difference? 

"Foam"  cables  use  this  term  to  refer  to  the 
dielectric  material;  it  is  cellular  polyethy- 
lene, which  looks  a  bit  like  foam  rubber,  and 
is  softer  and  spongier  than  solid-diclcctrics, 
The  "foam**  stuff  is  usually  very  white  in 
color  (although  it  needn't  be)  and  you  can 
permanently  indent  it  with  your  fingernail. 
Foam  cables  tend  to  be  a  bit  more  flexible 
than  those  with  solid  dielectrics,  and  their 
transmission  losses  will  be  slightly  lower  for 
a  given  cable  type  and  diameter.  However, 
there  are  drawbacks.  The  cellular  foam 
melts  easily  at  a  relatively  low  temperature, 
and  once  melted,  it  is  permanently  damaged. 
Because  of  this,  foam  cables  are  really  in- 
tended for  "crimp-on"  connectors,  not  the 
solder-on  kind,  which  obviously  will  expose 
the  dielectric  to  very  high  temperatures  dur- 
ing the  soldering  operation.  Also,  the  nature 
of  the  foam  dielectric  is  to  absorb  water  eas- 
ily, making  the  cable  quicker  to  contaminate 
if  the  jacket  is  pierced  or  if  a  terminating 
connector  leaks  a  bit  of  water.  Solid  dielec- 
tric cables  are  more  robust  and  will  with- 
stand soldering  heat  better,  and  are  also  less 
prone  to  the  absorption  of  moisture.  Because

of  the  operating  temperature  restrictions,  no 
"foam"  cable  is  mil-qualified,  However, 
throughout  this  article  I  have  recommended 
RG8X  for  some  applications,  and  RG8X  is  a 
''foam"  cable  type.  Use  it  carefully. 

Why  does  "foam"  coble  liave  less  loss? 

Two  reasons.  One,  the  cellular  polyethy- 
lene has  a  lower  dielectric  constant  than  sol- 
id, so  dielectric  losses  are  somewhat  lower. 
Two,  because  of  this  same  fact,  the  center 
conductor  will  be  larger  in  diameter  (for  the 
same  outside  conductor  diameter)  to  main- 
tain 50  ohms  impedance,  (The  nominal 
impedance  is  a  function  of  the  inner  conduc- 
tor diameter  as  related  to  the  outer  conductor 
diameter,  and  the  constant  of  the  dielectric 
used  between  them  J  With  a  slightly  larger 
diameter  center  conductor,  ohmic  losses 
(and  skin-effect  losses  at  RF)  will  be  some- 
what reduced,  without  impacting  the  overall 
diameter  of  the  cable,  Whether  or  not  you'll 
really  notice  the  difference  in  loss  will  de- 
pend on  the  length  of  cable  you  use. 

What  about  "9913?"  Is  if  as  good  as  They 
say  it  is? 

"9913'*  is  excellent  with  respect  to  trans- 
mission loss  and  power  handling  ability.  It  is 
often  called  "poor  man's  hardline"  because 
it  might  be  nearly  as  good  as  hardline,  while 
costing  far  less.  "9913"  is  really  just  an  ex- 
tension of  "foam"  dielectric  cable.  Instead  of 
using  cellular  polyethylene,  Beldcn  (the  in- 
ventor of  9913)  uses  a  thin  spiral  of 
polyethylene  dielectric  material  as  a  spacer 
to  hold  the  center  conductor  in  placet  and  a 
lot  of  the  dielectric  is  really  the  air  between 
the  spiral  turns.  Picture  the  dielectric  in  9913 
as  a  long  spring,  with  lots  of  coils  and  air  in 
the  spaces  between.  As  a  result,  the  dielec- 
tric constant  is  even  lower  than  in  "foam" 
cables,  the  center  conductor  is  even  larger 
and  has  less  resistance,  and  everybody  is 
happy  as  a  clam.  Of  course,  braided  outei 
conductors  for  9913  would  never  work,  as 
there'd  be  nothing  rigid  enough  to  hold  the 
cable  together.  So  the  manufacturers  use  a 
very  thin  wall  of  polyethylene,  covered  with 
aluminum  foil  to  make  the  outer  coaxial 
conductor.  Since  you  can't  really  solder  to 
aluminum  foil,  they  cover  that  with  some 
tinned  copper  braid  material.  The  braid 
serves  no  particular  purpose  other  than  giv- 
ing you  something  to  solder  to  (for  a  PL259) 
or  clamp  to  (for  a  type  N). 

The  problem  (and  there's  always  a  prob- 
lem with  anything  that  seems  too  perfect)  is 
that  9913  is  far  less  flexible  than  conven- 
tional cables,  will  not  withstand  repealed 
bending  (due  mostly  to  thai  big,  fat,  solid 
center  conductor  and  the  fragile  aluminum 
shield),  is  easily  contaminated  by  the  very 
first  droplet  of  water  that  might  enter  in  past 
a  connector,  and  is  too  fragile  to  rigidly 
clamp  to  a  lower  leg  or  other  solid  support. 
If  you  use  proper  precautions,  9913  is  great 
stuff.  If  you  don't  you'll  wind  up  replacing  it 
frequently,  Belden  will  be  glad  to  provide 
you  with  an  applications  note  on  how  to  use 
9913  correctly.  It  was  really  intended  for 
crimp- type  connectors,  not  solder-on  ones, 
so  be  extra  careful. 


I've  heard  that  a  solid  center  conductor  in 
coax  is  better  than  a  stranded  one.  Is  that 
true?  If  so,  why? 

No,  this  really  isn't  true.  Since  the  RF 
currents  flow  only  on  the  perimeter  of  any 
conductor,  only  the  outside  diameter  of  the 
center  conductor  is  of  consequence  in  deter- 
mining attenuation,  {The  same  is  true  for  the 
inside  diameter  of  the  outer  conductor,  be- 
cause that's  where  the  current  flows  there.) 
To  maintain  a  constant  and  desired 
impedance,  the  ratio  of  the  o.d.  of  the  inner 
conductor  to  the  i.d.  of  the  outer  conductor 
must  be  a  fixed,  predetermined  quantity  for 
any  given  dielectric  material.  It  doesn't  real- 
ly matter  if  the  inner  conductor  is  solid  or 
stranded,  as  long  as  its  o.d  (outside  diame- 
ter) is  correct  to  maintain  the  desired  nomi- 
nal impedance.  Solid  conductors  are  gener- 
ally used  in  cables  that  will  not  be  exposed 
to  repeated  flexing,  like  9913  and  hardline, 
while  stranded  center  conductors  are  used  in 
cables  intended  for  flexing  and  smaller-ra- 
dius bends  because  the  stranded  conductors 
are  far  more  flexible.  For  this  reason,  I'd  al- 
ways recommend  cables  with  a  stranded

center  conductor  for  routing  in  tight  spaces, 
around  rotators,  in  mobile  installations,  as 
"patch"  cables  for  use  around  the  shack  and 
in  other  applications  where  flexibility  is  re- 
quired. For  example,  rather  than  using 
RG58/U  orRG58A/U.  I'd  recommend 
RG58C/U  in  almost  all  applications  for 
small-diameter  cable.  The  RG58C/U  has  a 
stranded  center  conductor  while  RG58/U 
and  RG58A/U  do  not.  A  perfect  example  of 
the  resilience  of  the  stranded  conductor  ca- 
ble is  when  it  is  used  to  attach  a  mobile 
"mag  mount"  antenna,  where  the  car  door 
may  be  repeatedly  slammed  against  the  ca- 
ble. RG58/U  might  withstand  this  abuse  on- 
ly a  few  times  before  it  finally  breaks,  while 
RG58C/U  will  withstand  similar  abuse  hun- 
dreds of  times  because  it  is  so  much  more 
flexible,  (It's  still  not  a  great  idea  to  slam  a 
car  door  against  the  coax,  but  I  know  it's 
done,  and  will  be  done  for  years  to  come.) 

F  ve  heard  that  coax's  ability  to  withstand 
UV  radiation  has  something  to  do  with  the 
cable's  si0x  designator,  like  Alt),  BlU,  C/Ut 
etc.  Whafs  the  story  on  this? 

Cables  will  last  nearly  forever  if  they're 
never  exposed  to  excessive  temperatures 
(hot  or  cold),  weather,  or  ultraviolet  radia- 
tion. Unfortunately,  that  means  we  really 
can't  use  them.  In  the  real  world,  cables  are 
exposed  to  all  these  things  which  impact  op- 
erating life.  In  amateur  installations,  the  fac- 
tors that  detract  from  the  operating  life  of 
coaxial  cable  are  typically  abrasion,  mois- 
ture, and  UV  radiation.  UV  radiation,  which 


gives  us  such  great  tans  in  the  summer,  can 
cause  the  plasticizers  in  the  jacket  materials 
of  coax  to  "migrate"  and  flow  through  the 
braid  and  into  the  dielectric  material.  When 
this  happens*  the  dielectric  becomes  contam- 
inated and  the  cable's  attenuation  increases, 
To  avoid  this  occurrence,  manufacturers — 
especially  mil-qualified  ones — began  using 
"UV  stabilized"  jacket  materials  (usually 
polyvinyl  chloride,  or  #TVC")  which  will 
withstand  U V  radiation  under  normal  condi- 
tions without  migration.  Unless  you  intend 
to  use  all  your  coax  indoors,  where  it  will 
never  be  exposed  to  the  sun's  rayst  it  cer- 
tainly pays  to  use  coax  cable  that  has  a  "UV 
stabilized"  jacket  material.  This  material  is 
commonly  called  "Type  HA*"  an  industry 
buzz-word  for  the  enhanced  properties  dis- 
cussed here.  Old-fashioned  RG8/U  was  not 
Type  1 1  A;  RG&A/U  supposedly  was,  and  re- 
placed RG8/U  on  the  military  QPL  (Quali- 
fied Products  List)  for  M1L-C-17D  years 
ago.  Because  of  the  confusion  created  by 
two  such  similar  pan  numbers,  RG8/U  and 
A/U  were  dropped  from  the  QPL  entirely 
and  have  been  replaced  with  RG213/U, 
which  should  automatically  have  a  UV  sta- 
bilized jacket,  if  it  is  real  mil-spec  coax.  A 
similar  story  exists  for  RG5S/U:  The  old 
number  was  not  Type  IIA,  but  RG58A/U, 
B/U  and  C/U.  This  is  a  bit  confusing,  so  if 
pays  when  purchasing  cable  to  find  out  for 
sure  if  the  product  has  a  Type  IIA  jacket  ma- 
terial Ail  the  newer  mil-spec  products  do, 
but  many  commercial  products  don't. 
RG8X,  which  is  a  purely  commercial  prod- 
uct (and  is  not  mil-spec  in  any  form)  is  made 
by  a  variety  of  manufacturers  using  different 
materials;  some  are  UV  stable  and  some  are 
not.  RG8X  and  other  commercial  cables  are 
often  available  with  a  white-colored  jacket 
material,  which  may  be  desirable  for  those 
wishing  to  "hide"  the  coax  against  the  side 
of  a  light-colored  building  or  interior  walls. 
Whether  the  white  jacket  material  is  UV  sta- 
ble or  not,  it  will  reflect  the  sun's  rays  better 
than  a  black  jacket  and  run  cooler  and  ab- 
sorb less  UV  radiation  than  black-jacketed 
coax.  The  white-colored  stuff  is  often  used 
in  marine  applications,  where  UV  exposure 
is  the  norm, 

/  used  RG58IU  to  feed  my  2  meter  anten- 
na for  years,  and  its  VSWR  was  always 
1 ,2:1 .  I  just  replaced  the  feedtine  with 
brand-new  RG2I31U  of  the  same  length  and 
now  the  antenna  VSWR  measures  almost 
2:1.  Why  is  the  new  coax  so  had? 

Congratulations!  You've  actually  im- 
proved your  whole  system  by  a  large  factor, 
and  your  new  VSWR  measurement  is  far 
more  accurate.  You're  obviously  measuring 
the  SWR  down  at  the  rig,  and  not  up  at  the 
antenna  feed  point,  which  is  where  it  should 
be  measured.  Since  VSWR  is  a  ratio  of  feed- 
line  to  load  impedance  (not  rig  to  antenna!), 
a  •'flat"  (1:1 )  SWR  will  only  exist  when  the 
antenna  impedance  is  exactly  the  same  as 
the  feedlinc's.  If  there's  any  mismatch  at  all, 
some  reflected  power  will  result.  When  you 
used  RG58/U,  a  large  amount  of  that  reflect- 
ed power  was  absorbed  by  the  coax  because

73  Amateur  Radio  Today  •  May,  1 993  17 


it  had  lots  of  loss,  The  reflected  power  just 
created  some  cable  healing  and  never  made 
it  down  to  your  VSWR  bridge  at  the  "rig'1 
end  of  the  line.  Now  that  you're  using  less 
lossy  cable*  more  of  the  reflected  power  is 
actually  being  conducted  back  to  your 
bridge,  and  your  rig,  and  less  is  being  ab- 
sorbed by  the  coax.  This  is  a  very  normal 
condition.  The  new  coax  isn*t  "bad,"  it  is 
probably  far  better  than  the  old  coax  was.  If 
you  take  the  trouble  to  measure  VSWR  right 
at  the  antenna  itself,  you  should  find  it  will 
be  the  same  with  any  50  ohm  feedlinc  you 
connect  to  it.  The  best  thing  to  do  is  re-tune 
the  antenna,  using  a  bridge  connected  direct* 
ly  lo  it  (up  on  the  roof,  tower,  or  whatever) 
and  try  to  optimize  this  match  to  1:1  at  the 
frequency  of  interest  If  you  can  do  this, 
there  will  be  no  standing  waves  on  the  feed- 
linc and  the  SWR  wilt  measure  the  same  at 
the  antenna,  the  rig,  or  anywhere  in  between. 
By  the  way,  all  the  reflected  power  will 
eventually  be  absorbed  by  the  feedline  re- 
gardless of  how  much  there  is.  This  is  an  in- 
teresting subject  on  which  much  has  been 
written,  and  there's  insufficient  space  to 
cover  it  completely  here. 

How  can  I  keep  water  out  of  my  feedline? 

A  few  simple  precautions  will  prevent 
moisture  from  entering  coax  in  most  situa- 
tions. The  first  is,  when  measuring,  cutting 
and  handling  the  cable,  be  careful  not  to  cre- 
ate abrasion  of  the  jacket.  While  some  ca- 
bles are  nearly  impervious  to  rough  handling 
(like  the  ITT  Impcrvion  cables)  because  they 
are  "self-healing,"  most  are  really  quite  frag- 
ile. Don't  drag  your  coax  across  the  pave- 
ment or  roofing  materials,  and  don't  yank  it 
through  the  legs  of  your  tower.  Treat  it  as 
though  it  were  expensive  silk  fabric  that 
could  be  easily  damaged — because  it  can. 

The  second  thing  is,  install  the  exposed 
connector  (the  one  that  attaches  to  your  an- 
tenna) in  a  precise,  proper  and  professional 
manner.  Make  sure  the  jacket  ends  inside  the 
RF  connector,  and  that  no  braid  is  exposed 
after  the  connector  is  installed.  Then,  weath- 
erproof the  connector  as  well  as  possible. 
''Coax  Seal'1  weatherproof  putty  works  well, 
if  its  directions  are  followed  carefully.  This 
stuff  molds  itself  around  the  connector  and 
the  coax  near  the  connector  and  is  very 
weather  resistant,  Lacking  "Coax  Sear  or 
something  similar,  you  can  try  spraying  the 
connector  and  a  few  inches  down  the  coax 
with  Krylon  #*Klcar  KoteT\  then  wrapping 
with  overlapping  layers  of  high-quality  vinyl 
tape  like  3M  "Scotch  88"  electrical  tape, 
then  spraying  over  the  tape  with  another 
coaling  of  "Klear  Kote."  It  is  not  impossible 
to  make  an  exposed  RF  connector  totally 
weather  resistant,  it  just  takes  some  practice 
and  some  patience,  Then,  don 7  pull  the  coax 
straight  away  from  the  antenna  connector 
and  run  it  down  a  mast,  boom  or  tower  leg: 
Make  a  "drainage  loop"  in  the  coax,  maybe 
6"  or  so  in  diameter,  by  forming  a  360-de- 
gree  coil  in  the  coax  before  routing  toward 
the  shack.  Make  this  "loop"  very  close  to  the 
coax  connector,  preferably  an  inch  or  two 
away.  Tape  the  loop  in  place  so  it  will  hold 


its  form,  and  then  carefully  route  the  coax 
towards  the  shack,  never  pulling  hard  on  it, 
When  installing  the  "drainage  loop,"  make 
sure  the  loop  itself  is  all  below  the  antenna 
connector,  with  the  turn  of  the  loop  facing 
down  towards  the  ground.  This  will  help 
prevent  any  moisture  that  happens  to  enter 
the  connector  from  "wicking"  down  the 
coax  and  contaminating  the  whole  length,  so 
if  you  do  have  a  water  problem  in  the  future 
it  will  be  confined  to  the  first  few  inches 
near  the  antenna  connector.  If  this  does  hap- 
pen, at  least  you'll  have  enough  coax  left  up 
there  to  cut  off  the  old  connector  and  the 
few  inches  of  contaminated  coax,  install  a 
new  connector  and  reattach  it  to  the  antenna. 
You  won't  have  to  replace  the  whole  line. 

How  can  I  tell  if  my  surplus  coax  is  any 
good?  i  got  a  real  bargain  on  it,  but  am 
afraid  to  use  it  until  J  test  it  somehow. 

Brst,  cut  a  few  inches  off  each  end  of  the 
coax  to  get  a  "fresh  end"  exposed.  Then,  cut 
away  the  outer  jacket  to  expose  the  braid.  Is 
the  braid  shiny?  (It  may  be  pure  copper, 
tinned  copper  or  silver-plated  copper,  but  in 
all  cases  it  should  have  a  shiny,  new  finish 


€*When  measuring,  cutting 
and  handling  the  cable, 
be  careful  not  to  create 
abrasion  of  the  jacket" 


and  not  be  discolored,  green  or  black.)  Now, 
pull  back  the  braid  and  look  at  the  dielectric 
material.  Does  it  have  a  new-looking,  con- 
sistent color?  (It  may  be  white,  off-white, 
transluscent  or  nearly  any  color,  but  it 
should  not  be  stained  or  discolored  by  the 
braid  oxides  or  jacket  plasiicizers.)  Now,  cut 
back  some  of  the  dielectric  and  look  at  the 
center  conductor.  Is  it  shiny  and  new  look- 
ing?  (It  may  be  pure  copper,  copper-plated, 
tinned,  or  silver-plated,  but  it  should  look 
shiny  and  new  and  not  be  oxidized.)  If  the 
answer  to  all  these  questions  is,  "Yes/*  then 
the  cable  is  probabiy  fine.  But  you  may  want 
to  make  an  electrical  measurement  just  to  be 
sure. 

If  you  have  a  good  VSWR  bridge  or  di- 
rectional coupler  of  high  quality,  you  can 
make  two  simple  measurements.  First,  in- 
stall connectors  on  both  ends  of  the  coaxial 
line.  Next,  connect  your  VSWR  bridge  at 
the  transmitter  end  of  the  line  with  a  short 
"jumper"  and  connect  the  TX  end  of  the 
bridge  to  your  transmitter.  Then,  install  a 
"dead  short**  circuit  across  the  far-end  con- 
nector, which  would  normally  go  to  the  an- 
tenna. You  can  make  a  good  short  circuit 
that  will  be  effective  up  to  144  MHz  or  so 
by  using  a  piece  of  #12  copper  wire  and  sol- 
dering it  between  the  center  and  outer  con- 
ductors of  a  mating  receptacle.  Keep  the 
win;  very  short,  under  one* fourth  of  an  inch 
long,  (At  frequencies  above  144  MHz,  a 
commercial  short-circuit  RF  termination, 
usually  type  N,  will  work  better  These  are 
available  inexpensively  via  surplus  outlets.) 


Now  transmit,  using  the  lowest  possible 
power  to  obtain  a  reasonable  reading  on 
your  VSWR  bridge  or  wattmeter.  Switch  the 
bridge  back  and  forth  between  forward  and 
reflected  range*.  The  VSWR  should  read  in- 
finity, or  close  to  it:  Forward  and  reflected 
power  will  both  be  the  same  if  the  cable  has 
minimal  loss.  The  difference  between  for- 
ward and  reflected  power  indications  is  the 
power  lost  in  the  cable,  but  remember  this 
will  be  the  power  lost  by  the  signal  traveling 
both  up  and  down  the  cable  (to  the  short-cir- 
cuit termination  and  back  to  the  transmitter), 
so  the  attenuation  in  just  one  direction  is 
one-half  the  difference  between  forward  and 
reflected  power  readings. 

For  example,  if  you  transmit  with  5  watts 
of  power  and  measure  a  reflected  power  of 
2.5  watts,  a  total  of  3  dB  is  lost  by  the  cable 
when  the  signal  travels  to  the  termination 
and  back  again.  The  single-trip  loss  (signal 
traveling  from  transmitter  to  termination  on- 
ly) will  be  one-half  this  amount,  or  1,5  dB. 
The  dB  loss  is  calculated  as  follows: 

Attenuation  (dB)  =  10  log,0  _J!! — 

P2 

Where  PI  is  the  transmitter  forward  pow- 
er (5W),  P2  is  the  reflected  power  (2.5  W) 
and  the  attenuation  is  for  a  "round-trip"  in 
the  cable;  the  one-way  attenuation,  which  is 
a  more  relevant  parameter,  is  one-half  this 
amount. 

If  you'd  prefer  not  to  intentionally  trans- 
mit into  a  short-circuit  (and  some  solid-state 
rigs  won't  lei  you,  due  to  their  internal 
VSWR  protection  circuitry),  you  can  make  a 
similar  analysis  by  taking  a  few  extra  steps 
and  using  a  good  50  ohm  "dummy"  load,  as 
follows: 

Connect  your  wattmeter  lo  your  transmit- 
ter using  a  short  "patch1'  cable,  and  termi- 
nate the  far  end  of  the  coax  line  with  a  high- 
quality  50  ohm  (non-reactive)  dummy  load. 
Connect  the  TX  end  of  the  coax  to  the  an- 
tenna port  of  the  wattmeter,  and  transmit 
with  as  much  power  as  possible  to  achieve  a 
high-scale  reading  on  the  meter-  Read  this 
indication  and  write  it  down.  Then,  discon- 
nect the  wattmeter  from  the  transmitter,  con- 
nect the  coax  directly  to  the  transmitter,  and 
re- install  the  wattmeter  at  the  far  end  of  the 
coax,  right  next  to  the  dummy  load.  Trans- 
mit again  using  the  same  power  as  before 
and  record  this  reading,  Subtract  the  lower 
reading  (which  should  be  the  second  one) 
from  the  higher  reading,  and  calculate  the 
one-way  cable  loss  using  the  same  attenua- 
tion formula  as  before  (10  times  the  log  of 
the  power  ratio).  Using  this  method  should 
yield  exactly  the  same  results  as  using  the 
"return  loss"  method  described  earlier. 

In  the  example  set  forth,  where  the  cable 
has  t  .5  dB  loss,  you  might  measure  25  watts 
at  the  transmitter  and  17,7  watts  at  the  far 
end  of  the  line.  The  loss  of  7.3  watts  in  this 
case  is  exactly  1.5  dB. 

I  tend  to  use  the  ^return  loss"  method, 
with  a  very  high-quality  short-circuit  termi- 
nation, for  most  of  my  cable  evaluations  be- 
cause it  is  simpler,  and  does  not  require  in- 


1 8  73  Amateur  Radio  Today  •  May,  1 993 


stalling  the  meter  at  each  end  of  the  line.  But 
I  also  usually  use  a  signal  generator  running 
very  low  power  (like  10  milliwatts,  which  is 
+  10  dBm)  and  a  very  good  directional  cou- 
pler in  my  system,  so  I'm  not  relying  on 
transmitters  and  high-powered  wattmeters. 
Attenuation  in  any  cable  is  a  fixed  number  at 
a  given  lest  frequency  and  will  not  vary  with 
power  applied,  so  my  system  yields  very  ac- 
curate results  and  is  a  quick  way  to  check 
lots  of  cable. 

As  discussed  throughout  this  article,  there 
is  more  to  know  about  coaxial  cable  than 
just  how  much  loss  it  has.  Its  overall  quality 
of  materials  and  construction,  resistance  to 
the  effects  of  weathering  and  UV  radiation, 
flexibility,  ease  of  use  and  other  factors  can 
be  equally,  if  not  more,  important.  Yet,  at- 
tenuation (or  loss)  is  probably  the  most  im- 
portant criteria  for  (he  majority  of  users  and 
applications,  especially  if  the  load  cannot, 
for  some  reason,  be  matched  to  the  line  and 
a  high  SWR  results. 

One  last  note  on  this  subject:  Do  not  be 
misled  into  thinking  that  SWR,  or  the  match 
between  your  fccdline  and  its  terminating 
load,  is  any  indication  of  efficiency.  The  two 
parameters — SWR  and  efficiency — are  mu- 
tually exclusive.  It  can  be  proven  that  if  your 
feedlinc  loss  is  zero,  it  won't  matter  what  the 
SWR  is  because  100%  of  all  the  power  gen- 
erated by  your  transmitter  will  be  coupled  to 
the  antenna  and  no  power  will  be  lost*

An  rffatMt  Everything 

Amplifier 

Change  from  7  MHz  to  225  MHz  with  no 


bandswitching  or  tuning 

by  John  Cunningham  AA4AW 


/ 


There  are  limes  when  you  need  more  pow- 
er lo  get  into  a  repealer  or  to  be  heard 
across  the  country.  People  who  operate  hand- 
helds  or  QRP  sometimes  find  that  they  have 
a  hard  time  communicating  with  such  limited 
power  at  their  disposal.  However,  buying  an 
amplifier  for  10  meters,  another  for  6  meters, 
another  for  2  meters,  and  still  another  for 
1.25  meters  can  get  expensive.  Wouldn't  it  be 
nice  to  have  an  amplifier  that  took  care  of  all 
these  bands? 

The  amplifier  described  here  meets  these 
requirements.  It  is  broadbanded  from  7  to 
225  MHz — the  range  of  10  amateur  bands 
(40,  30, 20,  17,  15,  12,  10,  6,  %  and  L25  me- 
ters). It  will  operate  on  CW\  SSB,  AM,  and 
FM — or  any  other  mode  that  is  used  on  these 
frequencies.  It  can  be  fed  with  an  input  of 
1/10  to  24  watts  (though  there  is  not  much 
gain  above  12  watts  input)  and  can  deliver  an 
output  of  more  than  200  watts.  It  can  be  op- 
erated over  a  voltage  range  of  12  to  28  volts. 

Field-effect  transistors  are  more  immune 
to  damage  from  high  SWR  and  thermal  run- 
away than  bipolar  transistors.  They  also  have 
higher  gain,  greater  efficiency,  and  lower 
noise.  They  can  be  operated  over  a  greater 
voltage  and  power  range  than  bipolar  transis- 
tors. 

The  MRF175GV  is  a  Gemini  twin  which 
means  it  is  two  balanced  transistors  in  one 
package.  The  amplifier  designed  here  will 
not  work  unless  the  transistors  are  balanced. 

Field-effect  transistors  have  a  few  draw- 


backs. They  are  more  prone  to  static  damage, 
and  care  must  be  exercised  during  handling 
until  they  are  soldered  onto  the  board.  They 
easily  go  into  oscillation,  owing  to  their  high 
gain.  Be  careful  not  to  drive  them  too  hard 
and  destroy  the  gates.  If  there  is  a  chance  of 
this  happening  a  limiting  circuit  should  be  in- 
stalled at  the  input  of  the  amplifier. 

Collecting  the  Parts 

The  MRFI75GV  field  effect  transistor  can 
be  ordered  from  RF  Parts  (telephone:  1-800- 
737-2787  or  619-744-0700).  The  transform- 
ers, chip  caps,  and  copper  heat  spreader  are 
available  from  Communication  Concepts, 
Inc,  (hereafter  referred  to  as  CCI)  at  508 
Millstone  Drive,  Xenia,  Ohio  45385  (tele- 
phone: 513-426-8600).  Experimenters  who 
plan  to  use  a  similar  design  in  future  projects 
should  purchase  the  coax  needed  to  make  the 
transformers  instead  of  buying  them  fully  as- 
sembled. CCI  will  not  send  less  than  five  feet 
of  the  coax  in  any  one  shipment.  Five  feci  is 
enough  to  build  five  output  transformers  and 
almost  10  input  transformers.  However,  once 
you  go  this  route  you  must  also  buy  the  fer- 
rite  beads  that  accompany  the  transformers. 

The  total  cost  of  this  project  is  about  $362, 
but  that  doesn't  seem  so  high  when  you  con- 
sider that  many  of  the  parts  must  be  ordered 
in  more  quantity  than  is  necessary  for  this 
project,  and  the  excess  can  be  used  on  future 
ventures.  The  copper  heat  spreader,  for  in- 
stance, can  be  cut  into  three  pieces  and  used

20  73  Amateur  Radio  Today  May,  1993 


in  two  other  projects.  Also  remember  that  a 
high  percentage  of  the  cost  is  in  the  transistor 
at  $154.  If  this  sounds  expensive,  consider 
that  to  get  200  watts  from  commercially-built 
amplifiers  you  usually  pay  more  than  S200, 
and  most  of  these  amplifiers  are  single-band! 
Multiply  $200  by  the  10  amateur  bands  that 
this  amplifier  covers  and  you  get  a  whopping 
$2.000— far  more  than  the  cost  of  this  ampli- 
fier, Maybe  you  will  not  work  all  10  of  the 
amateur  bands  which  this  amplifier  will  han- 
dle, but  if  you  are  an  experimenter  you  prob- 
ably will. 

Construction 

I  used  a  Radio  Shack  276-1499  circuit 

board  and  cut  it  to  the  proper  size.  A  single 
Radio  Shack  card  will  build  two  of  these  am* 
plifiers.  This  design  consists  of  two  separate 
cards:  one  for  the  input  and  one  for  the  out- 
put. The  cards  are  cut  to  a  size  that  will  en- 
able ihem  to  fit  into  a  Radio  Shack  aluminum 
box  (no,  270-238)  5-l/4n  %  T  x  2-1/8".  The 
output  card  should  be  cut  to  2-3/4"  x  2- 
11/16",  The  size  of  the  inpui  card  should  be 
2-11/16"  x  1-3/4".  (Custom  prefetched  circuit 
boards  for  this  project  are  available  for  $7  a 
set  plus  $1.50  S  &  H  from  FAR  Circuits, 
18N640  Field  Court,  Dundee  IL  601 18.) 

A  copper  heat  spreader  is  cut  to  a  size  that 
will  allow  it  to  fit  into  the  box  and  enable  the 
lid  of  the  box  to  fit  over  it:  5-1/16"  x  2-11/16" 
will  make  the  proper  fit. 

You  will  need  to  drill  holes  into  the  boards, 
box,  heat  spreader,  and  heat  sink  to  mount  the 
hardware  that  holds  these  devices  together. 
These  holes  must  be  lined  up  with  the  hoies 
drilled  for  the  circuit  board,  except  that  the 
rectangular  holes  will  not  be  made  in  the  heat 
spreader,  boxf  or  heat  sink.  You  will  also 
need  to  drill  holes  for  the  bolts  that  hold  the 
transistor  in  place.  Sec  Figures  2  and  6, 

In  addition,  you  will  need  to  make  inserts 
in  the  circuit  boards  and  the  heat  spreader 
{See  Figures  2,  and  6).  I  used  a  grindstone  to 
mafce  the  inserts.  Without  the  inserts,  the  con- 
nectors will  not  fit  on  the  sides  of  the  box. 

Holes  should  be  drilled  on  the  output  board 
lo  bond  the  ground  on  the  component  side  of 
the  board,  (See  Figure  2.)  Once  the  holes  are 
drilled,  a  Lead  from  a  resistor  or  other  compo- 
nent can  be  placed  in  the  holes  and  soldered 
to  both  sides  of  the  board.

1  used  Radio  Shack  276-1435  etchant,  ac- 
cording to  the  instructions  printed  on  the 
etchant  bottle.  Only  one  side  of  the  board 
will  be  etched,  except  for  a  little  on  the  lower 
side  of  the  output  board  where  the  power 
transistor  will  be.  See  Figure  2.  I  drew  the 
pattern  with  a  felt  pencil  which  left  the  cop- 
per to  be  etched  exposed.  The  unetched  cop- 
per was  further  protected  by  duct  tape.  All 
components  arc  located  and  soldered  on  one 
side  of  the  board,  similar  to  a  ground-plane 
configuration — the  difference  being  that 
some  etching  is  done.  This  design  makes  for 
improved  grounding  and  ease  of  trou- 
bleshooting, repair,  and  modification* 

Once  the  circuit  boards  are  etched,  compo- 
nents can  be  soldered  in  place.  The  compo- 
nent layout  is  not  critical,  except  that  capaci- 
tors C5  and  C6  must  be  soldered  before 
transformers  Tl  and  T2  are  put  on  the 
boards.  1  recommend  that  you  don't  place 
these  transformers  on  the  boards  until  the 
boards  are  bolted  inside  the  box  and  the 
ferule  beads  are  put  in  place.  Otherwise, 
the  parts  placement  is  according  to  Figure  3. 
1  recommend  using  only  chip  caps  because 
the  leads  from  other  types  of  capacitors  may 
pick  up  stray  RF  and 
make  the  amplifier 
inoperable. 

The  most  difficult 
part  is  assembling  the 
transformers,  If  you 
order  from  CCI  specify 
that  you  want  a  low- 
impedance  input  trans- 
former and  a  high- 
impedance  output 
transformer  with  a  1:9 
ratio,  CCI  does  not  sell 
low-impedance  input 
transformers  with  a  4:1 
ratio  as  called  for  in 
this  design,  but  you 
can  order  a  9:1 
impedance  input  trans- 
former and  convert  it 
to  a  4: 1  transformer  by 
removing  one  of  the 
windings.  Otherwise, 
assemble  the  trans- 
formers according  to 
Figures  3  and  4,  If  you 
order  the  coax  to  build 
the  transformers  your- 
self,  specify  that  you 
want  both  input  and 
output  coax;  they  are 
not  the  same. 

For  use  at  frequen- 
cies below  100  MHz, 
ferrite  beads  must  be 
put  on  the  input  and 
output  transformers  to 
control  parasitic  oscil- 
lations, thereby  in- 
creasing stability.  See 
Photo  A  and  Figure  4. 
These  oscillations  can 
get  so  bad  that  they  de- 
stroy the  transistor  in-

Figure  J.  Preparation  of  the  transformer  coax.  Cut  the  transformers  to  the  lengt/is  shown, 
and  snip  the  outer  conductors*  The  inner  leads  that  are  to  he  5mm  should  have  their  outer 
conductors  stripped  6mm  and  the  leads  that  are  to  be  1 0  mm  should  he  stripped  1 1  mm.  Then 
strip  the  insulator  that  goes  between  the  inner  and  outer  conductors,  leaving  J  mm  of  insula- 
tor as  shown,  which  will  leave  the  inner  conductors  bare  at  the  proper  lengths. 


stantly — especially  when  operated  wilh  more 
than  20  volts  on  the  drain.  If  you  intend  to 
use  the  amplifier  exclusively  above  100 
MHz,  the  beads  can  be  left  off  the  output 
transformer  to  get  greater  efficiency.  In  addi- 
tion to  stabilizing  ihe  amplifier,  these  beads 
can  also  aid  in  heat  dissipation — something 
that  is  critical  if  the  amplifier  is  to  be  operat- 
ed at  its  maximum  power.  As  for  putting 
beads  at  the  input  transformer  for  use  above 
100  MHz,  they  should  be  installed  if  the  am- 


plifier will  be  operated  ai  more  than  20  volts. 
For  operation  below  20  volts,  generally  more 
power  is  obtained  from  the  amplifier  if  they 
are  left  off — especially  al  frequencies  above 
200  MHz.  However,  the  amplifier  is  more 
broadband  if  the  input  beads  are  left  on. 

Instructions  for  installing  the  beads  are  in- 
cluded if  you  order  them  from  CCL  1  used 
only  a  weak  kind  of  glue,  such  as  a  little  dab 
of  silicone  rubber,  to  hold  the  E  fertile  beads

Figure  4.  Preparation  of  the  transformers.  The  leads  between  the  transformer  windings 

should  he  as  short  as  possible.  Bend  the  coax  and  bend  the  feuds  till  they  touch  tip  to  tip,  and 
solder  the  rips  together.  When  properly  assembled,  an  ohmmeter  check  will  show  a  closed 
circuit  between  the  two  ends  of  the  transformer  leads  and  an  open  circuit  between  the  inner 
and  outer  conductors.  The  mistake  made  on  the  bottom  right  droning  is  easily  made  by  per- 
sons assembling  the  transformers  themselves.  Nothing  feels  worse  than  getting  the  trans- 
former assembled  and  fiaving  to  redo  it. 


them  off.  The  input  E  bead  ordered  from  CCI 
fits  the  9: 1  transformer  they  sell  but  is  a  bit 
large  for  a  4: 1  transformer  Therefore,  I  filed 
down  the  E  bead  until  it  made  a  tight  fit.  The 
I  beads  need  to  be  glued  to  the  heat  spreader 
after  the  circuit  boards  are  installed,  but  be- 
fore the  transformers  are  soldered  to  the  cir- 
cuit boards. 

A  rectangular  hole  needs  to  be  made  in  the 
output  side  of  the  box  for  ihe  relay.  If  you  do 
not  have  the  tools  to  cut  a  square  hole  you 
can  drill  several  small  holes  inside  the  area  of 
the  opening.  Then  use  a  hacksaw  to  further 
cut  the  area  into  straight  sides.  I  deliberately 
made  the  cutout  smaller  than  the  dimensions 
shown  because  I  did  not  want  the  relay  sock- 
et to  fit  too  loosely.  In  order  to  have  a  tight 
fit,  I  used  a  file  to  gradually  increase  the 
opening  to  the  dimensions  necessary  for  the 
relay  socket.  See  Figure  5  fur  the  positioning 
of  the  relay  and  the  input  and  output  connec- 
tions. 

When  the  box  and  circuit  board  have  been 
properly  prepared  you  are  ready  to  assemble 
the  amplifier-  The  heat  sink,  box,  and  heat 
spreader  fit  flush  together:  they  should  be 
sanded  to  eliminate  burrs.  Thermal  heat  sink 
compound  should  be  applied  between  these 
parts  as  they  are  placed  together.  I  used  Ra- 
dio Shack  276*1372  compound  for  this  pro- 
ject. However,  no  thermal  compound  should 
be  put  on  the  circuit  boards,  which  are  raised 
above  the  heal  spreader  by  means  of  washers 
(see  Figure  6).  The  leads  of  the  power  tran- 
sistor will  need  to  be  bent  sharply  upward — 
especially  the  output  (drain)  leads.  Separat- 
ing the  boards  from  the  heat  spreader  reduces 
heat  on  the  components  on  the  boards.  It  also 
makes  the  transformers  fit  flat  on  the  boards 
when  ferrite  coils  arc  used,  instead  of  being 
elevated  above  the  boards  as  they  would  be  if 
the  circuit  boards  were  not  elevated  from  the 
heal  spreader 

The  heat  sink,  box,  heat  spreader,  and  cir- 
cuit boards  are  bolted  together,  using  five 
bolts  for  each  board.  See  Figures  2  and  6.  I 
recommend  that  you  don't  tighten  the  bolts 
holding  the  boards  in  place  until  the  transis- 
tor is  bolted  securely. 

The  power  transistor  should  be  placed  on 
the  board  next.  Use  care  in  handling  a  field- 
effect  transistor  as  these  devices  are  subject 
to  being  destroyed  by  static  buildup.  When 
handling  FETst  pick  them  up  only  by  their 
sources,  It  is  a  good  idea  to  wear  a  grounded 
wrist  strap  and  to  work  on  a  static-free  table 
using  a  grounded  soldering  iron.  Once  the 
device  is  soldered  in  place  the  danger  from 
static  buildup  is  minimized. 

The  transistor  is  mounted  between  the  two 
circuit  boards  on  ihe  copper  heal  spreader. 
Thermal  heal  sink  compound  must  be  used 
when  mounting  the  transistor  Be  careful  not 
to  mount  the  transistor  backwards — that's 
easy  to  do.  The  two  flanges  that  have  one  of 
their  comers  cut  are  the  drains;  the  other  two 
are  the  gates.  The  leads  on  the  output  side  of 
the  transistor  are  bent  sharply  upward,  but  be 
careful  not  to  break  them.  Also,  there  is  a 
chance  of  the  output  leads  shorting  to  the  un- 
used side  of  the  board.  One  way  lo  prevent

this  is  lo  etch  away  a  small  part  of  the  output 
board  near  Llie  transistor.  Sec  Figures  2  and  6. 

Once  the  transistor  and  circuit  boards  are 
mounted  and  their  bolls  tightened,  solder  the 
flanges  to  the  transistors.  The  transformers 
can  be  positioned  now  and  soldered,  com- 
pleting the  installation  of  the  circuit  boards. 
Then  the  last  of  the  components  can  be  sol- 
dered in  place— VR  \  and  C12 — as  well  as 
the  connective  wires  for  ihe  receive  circuit 
and  the  wire  that  provides  the  power  for  Q2. 
See  Figure  5. 

Before  applying  voltage,  it  is  a  good  idea 
to  do  a  few  continuity  checks.  Sec  if  there  is 
zero  resistance  from  the  voltage  input  to  the 
drain  of  the  transistor.  Then  check  for  shorts 
between  the  drain  and  ground  and  between 
the  gate  and  ground.  If  you  find  shorts,  do 
not  proceed  until  the  trouble  is  corrected. 
Both  the  input  and  output,  however,  should 
have  a  short  to  ground. 

Checking  It  Out 

When  the  resistance  checks  arc  made,  you 
are  ready  to  test  the  amplifier.  Connect  the 
input  to  a  handie-talkie  or  other  low-power 
transmitter  and  the  output  to  a  dummy  toad 
that  has  some  kind  of  power  indicator.  If  you 
have  a  spectrum  analyzer,  so  much  the  better. 
A  dummy  load  wattmeter  will  do — so  will  a 
dummy  load  with  an  SWR  and  relative  pow- 
er indicator  placed  besween  the  amplifier  and 
the  dummy  load.  Be  sure  the  dummy  load  is 
capable  of  handling  more  than  200  watts. 

When  applying  voltage,  put  no  more  than 
12  volts  to  the  amplifier  at  firet.  Once  voltage 
is  applied,  quickly  check  the  voltage  on  the 
gates.  This  voltage  will  vary,  depending  on 
the  adjustment  of  R3+  For  now,  adjust  R3  un- 
til the  gate  voltage  reads  approximately  2 
volts.  The  gate  voltage  should  not  exceed  6 
volts. 

If  you  wish,  you  can  check  out  the  amplifi- 
er portion  of  the  project  before  you  check  out 
the  receive  portion,  To  do  this,  do  not  con- 
nect  one  side  of  RIO.  However,  once  the  am- 
plifier is  tested  and  RIO  is  reinstalled,  it  will 
have  to  be  realigned. 

Once  the  voltage  on  the  gale  is  2  volts,  ap-

ply  a  0,5  or  1  watt  RF  signal  to  ihe  input  of 
the  amplifier  The  relay  should  click  on.  If  it 
does  not,  adjust  CI  until  il  does.  If  Hie  relay 
siill  does  not  come  on,  there  is  either  a  com* 
ponent  breakdown  or  an  error  in  construc- 
tion, Once  the  relay  has  engaged,  see  if  there 
is  any  output  indication.  Adjust  capacitor  CI 
and  R3  for  maximum  output.  One  good  fea- 
ture of  this  amplifier  is  that  there  are  only 
l wo  adjustments  to  be  made:  CI  and  R3. 

All  this  sounds  simple,  and  it  usually  is. 
However,  these  amplifiers  have  a  tendency  to 
go  into  oscillation.  Turn  off  the  exciter,  and 


Figure  5,  The  front  and  back  sides  of  the  box,  showing  the  relay  mounting  and  relay  connec- 
tions. The  hole  near  the  relay  which  allows  DC  into  the  box  should  he  approximately  1/4*'  di- 
ameter. The  rectangular  opening  for  the  relay  should  be  I"  by  7/8",  The  holes  for  the  4'nH 
connectors  should  he  9/16". 


see  if  you  still  gel  a  power  indication  on  the 
wattmeter.  If  so,  the  amplifier  is  oscillating. 
Back  off  from  R3  until  the  oscillation  slops. 
CI  may  also  be  adjusted.  The  trick  is  to  get 
the  maximum  power  out  of  the  amplifier 
without  it  going  into  oscillation  and  remain- 
ing in  that  state  after  the  drive  has  stopped. 

When  properly  adjusted,  the  amplifier 
should  give  out  more  than  30  watts  at  12 
volts  with  1  watt  drive.  At  this  point,  you  can 
increase  the  power  of  the  amplifier  by  gradu^ 
ally  applying  more  voltage  to  the  drains. 
Never  exceed  28  volts  on  the  drains,  and 
never  let  the  voltage  on  the  gates  exceed  6 
volts — if  even  that  much. 

If  you  are  content  to  use  only  14  volts  (the 
power  available  in  most  automobile  electrical 
systems),  the  amplifier  can  be  used  for  con- 
tinuous duty  operaiion  on  all  modes.  At  this 
voltage  the  transistor  can  withstand  infinite 
SWR  and  any  other  conceivable  abuse  (ex- 
cept overdriving)  and  should  easily  outlast  its 
owner.  Notice  that  the  amplifier  gets  warm 
after  only  a  few  minutes — even  at  this  power 
level. 

A  word  of  caution:  Some  late-model  auto- 
mobiles are  equipped  with  computers  that 
will  break  down  if  a  transmitter  putting  out 
more  than  10  watts  is  used.  This  can  stop  the 
engine  and  lead  to  a  thousand-dollar  repair 
bill.  Check  your  automobile  owner's  manual 

Once  the  transmitter  is  functioning,  you 
are  ready  to  test  the  receive  circuits.  Since 
the  receive  circuil  consists  of  nothing  more 
than  a  relay  and  capacitor  CI 2,  there  should

Figure  6.  Bolting  the  amplifier  pans  together,  Note  that  the  flanges  of  the  output  of  the  power 
transistor  have  to  he  bent  upward.  The  output  of  the  transistor  can  short  to  the  bottom  of  the 
circuit  hoard  unless  a  small  part  of  the  bottom  of  the  hoard  is  etched.  See  Figure  2. 
Be  careful  to  make  the  input  and  output  connectors  touch  on  the  circuit  hoard,  or  the  ampli- 
fier may  nor  work  at  225  MHz.  Solder  the  inputs  and  outputs  directly  to  the  foil  of  the  hoard 
without  using  lead  lengths.  A  BNC  connector  could  he  used  in  place  of  the  type  N  connector 
used  in  this  experiment. 


be  no  problem  if  everything  was  installed 
correctly. 

How  It  Works 

When  an  RF  signal  is  put  into  the  amplifi- 
er, a  small  portion  of  it  flows  through  R12 
and  D2  (see  Figure  1),  which  turns  on  Q2. 
This  action  causes  the  relay  to  engage,  there- 
by disconnecting  the  receive  circuii  and  al- 
lowing voltage  from  the  power  supply  to  en- 
ter the  amplifier. 

Resistors  R I  through  R7  supply  the  proper 


bias  voltage  to  the  gates  of  Ql.  The  power 
supply  voltage  goes  to  the  drains  through  the 
T2  center  tap. 

The  transformers  are  wound  in  such  a  way 
that  they  match  the  50  ohm  impedances  of 
the  input  and  output  over  a  range  of  several 
octaves.  The  transformers*  ratios  are  the  ra- 
tios of  the  square  of  their  turns.  For  instance, 
one  turn  would  give  a  1:1  ratio,  two  turns  a 
1:4  ratio,  three  lurns  a  1:9  ratio,  and  four 
turns  a  1:16  ratio.

An  Experimenter's  Power  Supply 

An  adaptable  multi-voltage  supply. 


by  Fred  Reimers  KF9GX  and  Mark  Reimers 


After  you  have  built  a  special  project  and 
want  to  power  it  up,  you  connect  the 
completed  project  to  your  power  supply.  But 
what  do  you  do  when  the  project  requires 
special  voltages,  different  from  the  normal 
12  VDC  power  supply,  like  +9  and  +5  and  - 
5  and  -9  VDC?  You  say  to  yourself,  "I  need 
a  multi-voltage  power  supply  that  also  has 
negative  voltages,  and  I  have  to  be  able  to 
set  the  voltages  to  accommodate  different 
projects" 

Switching  Supplies  vs.  Standard  Trans- 
former Power  Supplies 

There  have  been  a  number  of  articles  on 
power  supplies  over  the  past  years.  Most  of 
these  have  been  single*  or  dual- voltage* 

Switching  power  supplies  have  a  lot  to  of- 
fer. They  provide  higher  efficiency  at  higher 
currents  than  transformer  supplies.  Switch- 
ing supplies  are  smaller  and  weigh  much 
less  than  transformer  supplies.  An  8-amp 
transformer  supply  could  weigh  six  to  10 
pounds,  while  a  switching  supply  could  be 
as  light  as  two  pounds.  Switching  supplies 
are  easier  to  filter  and  offer  better  regulation. 

Why  haven" i  there  been  published  con- 
struction articles  on  switching  power  sup- 
plies? Because  switching  power  supplies  are 
much  harder  to  design  and  it's  difficult  to 
keep  the  radiation  down.  Without  a  large 
amount  of  RFI  filtering  and  shielding,  you 
could  never  operate  a  radio  near  a  switching 
power  supply. 

Switching  power  supplies  are  not  as  reli- 
able as  conventional  transformer  power  sup- 
plies, though  the  commercial  supplies  are 
becoming  as  reliable  as  their  transformer 
counterparts.  The  weakest  links  in  switching 
supplies  are  the  switching  devices  (transis- 
tors or  FETs),  due  to  the  Di/Dt  transients  un- 


der load  conditions.  The  biggest  reason  why 
standard  transformer  power  supplies  are  still 
popular  with  us  builders  and  experimenters 
is  the  availability  of  parts  and  the  ease  of 
building  a  supply.  With  the  availability  of 
transformer  regulator  ICs  (ie.  the  723, 
78xx  series  and  317/337  devices),  and  ca- 
pacitors, it  is  easy  to  build  a  transformer 
power  supply. 

We  wanted  to  make  a  supply  that  was 
simple,  yet  versatile  enough  to  fit  all  low 
power  multi- voltage  applications.  The  sup- 
ply we  came  up  with  has  six  outputs  that  can 
be  independently  adjusted.  We  set  the  out- 
puts to  +12,  +9,  +5,  -5,  -9,  and  -12  VDC.

Circuit  Description 

The  power  supply  is  made  up  of  two  inde- 
pendent circuits,  the  positive  and  the  nega- 
tive voltage  sections.  Diodes  Dl-4  and  D5-8 
rectify  the  AC  voltage  and  CI  and  C2  filter 
the  DC  vohage  for  the  positive  and  negative 
sections.  Capacitors  C3,  5,  7,  9,  II,  and  14 
arc  placed  at  the  input  of  each  of  the  regula- 
tor ICs  for  regulator  stability;  C4t  6,  8,  10, 


12,  and  13  are  placed  at  the  output  of  each 
regulator  for  improved  transient  response, 
i.e.  to  improve  the  output  voltage  overshoot 
and  undershoot  response  when  a  load  is  ap- 
plied or  removed  from  the  output.  The  nega- 
tive and  positive  sections  arc  divided  into 
three  separate  regulator  circuits.  The 
LM317T  and  LM337T  regulator  ICs,  chosen 
because  of  their  availability,  require  only 
two  external  parts,  can  be  configured  as  vari- 
able regulators,  and  are  rated  at  1.5  amps 
(with  proper  heat-sinking).  The  voltage  ad- 
just resistor  was  chosen  as  5kf  but  lower  val- 
ues could  be  used  to  increase  the  adjustment 
sensitivity  and  to  lower  the  maximum  adjust- 
ed output  voltage. 

The  data  book  (Note  I)  gives  the  equation 
for  the  output  voltage  as: 

Vou»  =  Vref(1+R2/R1)  +  larfJR2 

Vref  is  a  constant  K25  volt  that  is  main- 
tained between  the  output  and  adjust  termi- 
nals by  the  regulator.  Thus,  the  lowest  volt- 
age that  can  be  achieved  from  the  LM300  sc- 
ries regulators  is  1,25  volts*  Using  the  above 
equation,  the  adjustable  resistor  value  is 
2t244  ohms  for  a  13,8  volt  output.  Using  a 
Ik  pot  would  yield  an  output  voltage  range 
of  L25  to  6.8  volts.  Depending  on  where  the 
output  voltage  of  the  individual  regulator  is 
set,  the  LED  current-limiting  resistor  should 
be  adjusted  to  keep  the  LED  current  in  a  safe 
operating  range,  as  specified  by  the  LED 
manufacturer  We  like  to  keep  the  LED  cur- 
rent between  10  and  20  milliamps. 

To  calculate  the  LED  current  for  the 
output  voltage  setting  you  want,  use  the 
formula:  , 

Rl^d  =  (Voui "  0  7)  /  0.015 

The  0,7  is  the  LED  voltage  drop  and  0.015 
is  the  LED  current  of  15  milliamperes.  For 
example,  for  Vou[  of  12  volts,  the  current-

limiting  resistor  should  be  750  ohms.  A  680 
or  820  would  also  work,  keeping  the  current 
in  the  13.78  to  16.6  milliamperes  range.  For 
a  tower  value  of  Vml  of  5V4  a  270  or  330 
ohm  resistor  will  do  the  job.  We  used  a  680 
ohm  LED  current- limiting  resistor.  This  kept 
the  LEDs  in  a  safe  operating  limit  at  the 
higher  voltages  and  still  allowed  the  LED  to 
light  dimly  when  the  output  voltage  was  ad- 
justed lo  5  volts. 

Wc  chose  a  3  amp  transformer  because  of 
its  availability  and  current  rating.  The  avail- 
able 3  amp  source  current  is  divided  be- 
tween the  three  regulator  circuits.  Two  sepa- 
rate transformers  were  used  for  the  AC  to 
keep  the  positive  and  negative  voltages  iso- 
lated. We  mounted  the  transformers  off  the 
PC  board. 

A  Word  About  RFI 

All  active  regulated  power  supplies  work 
great  until  you  use  them  to  power  up  the 
Transmitter  project  you  just  finished.  Have 
you  ever  wondered  why  the  voltage  drops 
or  increases  drastically  when  you  key  the 
transmitter?  This  is  due  to  RF  getting  back 
into  the  regulator  of  the  power  supply.  To 
prevent  this,  put  (X01  and  560  pF  or  470  pF 
capacitors  across  the  voltage  output  termi- 
nals. 

A  word  of  caution:  The  LM3l7s  and 
LM337s  like  to  have  a  load  on  them  at  all 
times.  If  the  LEDs  are  not  installed,  and  with 
no  load  on  the  regulator,  the  output  voltage 
could  float  up  to  the  input  unregulated  volt- 
age. The  LED  current  is  sufficient  to  keep 
the  output  voltage  from  floating  up. 

Construction 

The  project  is  assembled  in  a  Radio  Shack 
box  #270-250.  A  bigger  box  may  be  re- 
quired if  heal  sinks  and/or  from  panel  ad- 
justments are  used,  The  AC  power  switch 
should  be  a  DPDT  type  which  disconnects 
both  sides  of  the  line  when  the  power  supply 
is  turned  off.  The  fuse  should  be  in  the  high 
side  of  the  power  line  and  use  a  three-prong 
AC  plug  on  the  end  of  the  power  cord.  The 
regulator  ICs  are  rated  at  L5  amperes  but 
will  require  heat  sinks  for  the  lower  voltage 
applications  that  draw  more  current.  For  ex- 
ample, if  the  output  is  adjusted  to  5V  and  the 
load  current  is  0.75  mill  lamps*  there  will  be 
almost  10  watts  of  power  dissipated  into 
heat  in  that  regulator  IC.  We  did  not  show 
the  heat  sink  in  the  power  supply  pictured  in 
this  article.  When  adding  the  heat  sink,  re- 
member that  the  tabs  on  the  LM337Ts  are 
connected  to  the  input  voltage  and  the  tab  on 
the  LM317T  is  connected  to  the  output  volt- 
age. Mica  insulating  hardware  (such  as  Digi- 
Key  467IK-ND  or  4672K-ND,  or  Newark 
46F7847  with  insulating  shoulder  washers) 
must  be  used  to  isolate  the  tabs  of  the  regu- 
lators from  each  other.  The  power  supply  is 
assembled  on  a  nice  4"  x  2.75"  PC  board 
with  a  screened  legend  for  easy  assembly. 
The  board  is  available  from  FAR  Circuits 
(Note  3).  The  transformer  is  external  to  the 
board  and  connects  to  the  Tl  and  T2  points 
on  the  board.

Two  radios  in  one! 


It  never  failed.  No  matter  which  rig  I  hap- 
pened to  have  at  any  given  moment,  all  the 
action  seemed  to  be  on  another  band!  If  I  had 
my  2  meter  HT,  I  would  miss  my  normal  com* 
muting  skeds  on  440  MHz.  Yet  whenever  1 
had  my  440  MHz  HT  with  me,  I  would  always 
find  some  need  to  get  on  the  more  heavily 
populated  2  meter  band.  The  thought  of  car- 
rying around  the  extra  weight  of  two  full-size 
handie-talkies  and  a  couple  of  heavy-duty 
battery  packs  was  not  an  appealing  one. 

There  was  only  one  solution:  It  was  time  to 
upgrade  to  one  of  those  new,  compact,  dual- 
band  handhelds!  Having  had  excellent  results 
(with  both  performance  and  service)  with 
my  older  ICOM  HTs,  I  selected  the  ICOM 
IC-W2A, 

The  ICOM  IC-W2A  is  a  full-featured  dual- 
band  handheld  measuring  only  6  J*  high,  2.1 " 
wide,  and  1 .4"  thick.  The  rig  weighs  in  at  only 
1,2  lbs.  As  delivered,  frequency  coverage  is 
140-150  MHz  and  440-450  MHz  transmit, 
136-174  MHz  and  440*450  MHz  receive.  De- 
spite its  small  size,  the  W2A  offers  a  full  5 
watts  output  (at  13  volts)  on  both  bands,  four 
scanning  modes,  60  memories  (30  per  band), 
simultaneous  receive  on  both  bands,  full 
crossband  duplex  operation,  and  a  host  of 
other  functions.  Unlike  many  other  HTs,  the 
W2A  comes  equipped  with  a  heavy*duty  7,2 
volt,  f  t000  mAH  battery  pack  and  a  multifunc- 
tion PL  encoder/decoder  as  standard  fea- 
tures. Other  noteworthy  features  include  a 
24-hour  clock,  power  on/of?  timer,  two  power- 
saver  modes,  four  15-digit  autodialer  memo- 
riesT  and  a  pager  mode. 

Although  I  had  seen  photos  and  dimen- 
sions of  the  HT  prior  to  ordering  the  rig,  they 
still  did  not  prepare  me  for  the  surprise  1  ex- 
perienced when  I  opened  the  box.  How  could 
ICOM  fit  all  those  features  into  such  a  small 
package?  Although  the  W2A  may  sound 
large  due  to  its  6.7-  height,  the  heavy-duty 
BP-84  battery  pack  takes  up  three  of  those 
inches;  the  actual  radio  itself  is  only  3.7*  long! 
The  antenna  connector,  speaker  and  mike 
jacks,  external  power  jack,  rotary  tuning 
knob,  and  dual  concentric  volume/squelch 
knobs  are  placed  on  top  of  the  transceiver 
An  LCD  display  shares  the  front  panel  with 
the  internal  speaker/mike,  an  RX/TX  status 
indicator  LED,  and  no  less  than  22  individual 
buttons— no  small  feat  considering  the  W2A's 
6.5-square-inch  front  panel.  The  function  and

PTT  switches  are  located  on  the  left  side  of 
the  case.  The  lower  two-thirds  of  both  sides 
of  the  case  are  contoured  for  an  easy  and 
comfortable  grip. 

The  first  thing  I  noticed  about  the  W2A  is 
how  naturally  it  fits  in  the  paJm  of  the  hand. 
After  using  this  HT  for  a  few  hours,  going 
back  to  my  trusty  02AT/04AT  suddenly  felt  as 
if  I  were  holding  a  brick)  Although  the  W2A  is 
compact,  it  does  not  feel  cheap.  The  rig  has  a 
slightly  heavy  (for  its  size)  feel,  and  the  metal 
back  provides  structural  rigidity  while  serving 
as  a  heat  sink  for  the  output  modules. 
Squeezing  the  rig,  even  hard,  caused  none  of 
the  squeaking,  popping,  or  snapping  sounds 
common  to  many  plastic-cased  radios.  The 
W2A  felt  like  a  quality,  high-grade  piece  of 
electronic  gear. 

Features 

The  ICOM  W2A  is  chock-full  of  useful  fea- 
tures. There  are  30  memories,  plus  a  VFO 
memory,  call  channel  memory,  and  two  band- 
scan  memories  for  each  band.  Each  of  these 
is  capable  of  storing  not  only  frequency  and 
offset,  but  custom  offset,  PL  encode  mode 
and  frequency,  PL  squelch  mode,  and  chan- 
nel scanning  lockout  information  as  well.  Un- 
used memories  can  be  masked.  Memory 
backup  is  handled  by  an  internal  recharge- 
able battery,  although  ICOM  provides  no  in- 
formation as  to  how  long  memory  contents 
can  be  retained  with  no  external  power. 

There  are  five  different  scan  modes  avail- 
able. The  simplest  is  VFO  scan  mode.  Enter 
a  frequency  into  the  VFO  memory,  and  hit  the 
scan  up  or  scan  down  key.  This  has  the  same 
effect  as  tuning  a  receiver  across  its  tuning 
range.  Programmed  scan  mode  allows  the 
user  to  enter  two  frequencies  into  scan  mem- 
ory, and  the  radio  then  scans  continuously 
between  these  two  limits.  This  is  similar  to 
what  scanner  manufacturers  call  search 
scan.  Memory  scan  mode  scans  all  30  mem- 
ories,  regardless  of  their  lockout  or  "skip"  set- 
tings. Memory  skip  mode  scans  only  those 
memories  which  have  not  been  assigned 
lock-out  status.  Finally,  frequency  skip  mode 
allows  the  user  to  enter  up  to  20  frequencies 
in  memory;  and  perform  a  VFO  or  pro- 
grammed band  scan.  The  rig  will  then  ignore 
these  frequencies  while  scanning,  If  this 
weren't  enough,  alt  these  modes  have  two  re- 
sume modes:  timer  and  pause.  Timer  resume

stops  the  receiver  when  a  signal  Is  received, 

pauses  for  five  seconds,  and  resumes  scan- 
ning. Pause  resume  mode  stops  the  receiver 
when  a  signal  is  received,  and  wilt  not  re- 
sume scanning  until  two  seconds  after  the 
signal  ceases. 

The  ICOM  W2A  also  comes  equipped  with 
a  multifunction  PL  board  which  allows  full  PL 
encode/decode  functions.  The  PL  unit  can  be 
used  not  only  as  an  encoder  to  access  closed

repeaters,  but  also  as  a  subaudible  tone 
squelch  which  will  keep  the  receiver 
squelched  regardless  of  channel  activity  until 
the  unit  receives  the  proper  PL  tone.  When 
the  right  tone  is  received,  the  W2A  can  be  set 
to  either  open  the  squelch  and  receive  the 
signal,  or  to  emit  a  series  of  pager-like  beeps 
for  20  seconds.  Pushing  the  PTT  button  can- 
cels the  PL  alarm  mode  and  returns  the  fig  to 
PL  tone  squelch  mode,  allowing  reception  of 
the  desired  signal 

When  setting  PL  tones,  the  actual  tone  fre- 
quencies are  displayed  on  the  LCD!  instead 
of  the  archaic  two-digit  alpha-numeric  codes 
used  on  some  older  rigs.  Since  the  PL  board 
is  actually  two  units  in  one,  it's  possible  to 
transmit  with  a  PL  tone  on  one  band  and  acti- 
vate the  PL  squelch  on  the  other  band  using 
a  different  PL  tone.  It  is  also  possible  to  oper- 
ate both  receivers  in  PL  squelch  mode  using 
different  tones  on  each  band.  Although  the 
PL  tone  squelch  functions  during  crossband 
repeat  mode,  the  PL  encoder  does  not. 

The  W2A  also  sports  a  pager/code  squelch 
mode  which  is  activated  by  a  sequence  of 
DTMF  touch-tones.  This  mode  allows  for  all 
call,  group  call,  and  individual  call  modes, 
which  af]ow  a  single  transmission  to  trigger  all 
receivers,  a  subgroup  of  receivers,  or  a  single 
receiver,  respectively.  The  pager  tone  se- 
quences, as  well  as  the  pager  decoder 
codes,  are  entered  into  five  memory  positions 
reserved  for  this  function. 

Other  nice  touches  include  tuning  incre- 
ments which  can  be  set  at  5t  10,  12,5,  15,  20, 
25,  30,  and  50  kHz  steps  for  both  VFO  and 
scan  modes.  In  addition  to  these.  100  kHz 
and  1  MHz  steps  are  available  when  using 
the  tuning  knob  at  the  top  of  the  radio,  Fre- 
quencies can  also  be  input  directly  from  the 
keypad.  Transmit  offset  frequency  is  pro- 
grammable in  5  kHz  steps  from  5  kHz  to  10 
MHz.  The  IC-W2A  also  features  a  keyboard 
lock  function  which  locks  out  al]  keys  except 
the  dial  light  and  high/low  power  switch,  and 
a  PTT  lock  which  makes  it  impossible  to  key 
the  transmitters. 

A  number  of  features  specifically  address 
power  consumption  and  battery  life.  Transmit- 
ter power  output  rs  selected  from  four  steps 
rather  than  the  more  common  hi/low  setting, 
"Auto  off  mode  shuts  off  the  radio  if  no  trans- 
missions or  key  strokes  are  made  within  a 
specified  time  period.  Prior  to  shutting  down, 
the  rig  emits  a  number  of  beeps  to  warn  the 
user  of  its  intentions.  "Power  saver"  mode 
puts  the  W2A  into  standby  mode  after  five 
seconds  of  inactivity.  The  unit  will  then  turn 
on  every  few  seconds  and  check  for  a  re- 
ceived signal.  If  the  channel  is  quiet,  the  W2A 
goes  back  to  sleep  and  the  cycle  repeats.  If 
the  channel  is  busy,  the  radio  win  remain  on 
until  activity  ceases,  then  resume  power 
saver  mode.  The  Mon/ofT  duty  cycle  is  se- 
lectable between  a  1:4  and  a  1:16  ratio. 
Tower  saver"  works  only  when  monitoring  a 
channel — it  does  not  function  when  using  any 
of  the  scan  modes. 

Ironically,  some  of  the  W2ATs  biggest  fea- 
tures are  those  which  ICOM  does  not  men- 
tion in  the  owners  manual:  extended  wide-

band  receive  and  crossband  repeat  Both  of 
these  features  are  accessed  through  simple 
keyboard  sequences  without  the  need  to 
open  the  radio  or  perform  any  hardware  mod- 
ifications. 

Modifications  and  Operation 

To  open  the  coverage  range  of  the  receiv- 
er, turn  the  radio  off.  Then  turn  the  radio  on 
while  simultaneously  pushing  the  [LIGHT], 
[BJ,  and  [#]  keys.  After  I  performed  this  proce- 


dure, the  receiver  tuned  from  55-410  MHz 
{including  AM  aircraft)  on  the  VHF  band.  The 
UHF  receiver  covered  350-525  MHz  and  725- 
1026  MHz  {FM  only)!  Warning;  Please  re- 
member that  it  is  illegal  to  monitor  cetluiar 
phone  conversations!  As  expected,  receiver 
sensitivity  varied  widely  across  these  ranges. 
Due  to  high-pass  filtering  on  the  VHF  band 
for  image  rejection  purposes,  don't  expect  to 
hear  much  below  118  MHz.  Figures  1-3  show 
receiver  sensitivity  in  dBm  for  a  20  dB  quiet*

the  sidebar  table  cross-references  selected 
dBm  levels  to  microvolts.  Although  the  LCD 
display  goes  from  0-1300  MHz,  these  figures 
represent  actuaJ  receive  band  limits  as  con- 
firmed with  a  signal  generator. 

After  completing  this  modification,  access 
the  radio's  setup  menu  as  per  the  instruction 
manual.  Step  through  the  options  with  the 
[UP]  or  [DN]  keys  and  you  will  find  a  new  pa- 
rameter  not  listed  in  the  ICOM  manual,  called 
PL.  This  sets  the  highest  MHz  place  which 
can  be  programmed  by  the  direct  keyboard 
entry  mode,  selectable  between  1  MHzf  10 
MHz,  and  100  MHz.  Turn  the  tuning  knob  to 
set  the  PL  parameter  to  100.  then  press  ei- 
ther the  PTT  or  [CLR]  to  exit  the  setup  menu. 
The  VFO  can  now  be  tuned  to  any  frequency 
within  Its  extended  receive  range  by  simply 
entering  the  numbers  from  the  keypad.  For 
example,  say  the  VFO  is  set  at  440  MHz  and 
you  want  to  tune  to  903.525.  Simply  enter:  [#] 
[9]  [0]  [3]  [5)  ffl  [51 

To  enable  the  crossband  repeater  function, 
the  above  wideband  receiver  modification 
must  be  performed  first.  To  activate  the  re- 
peater, enter  the  desired  frequencies  and 
modes  (simplex  or  duplex)  and  push  the 
[VMAIN]  key.  While  holding  down  the  [FUNC- 
TION] key,  press  the  [2]  key  and  then  the 
[ENTER]  key.  The  keylock  [L]  symbol  will  now 
flash  on  the  LCD  display,  indicating  that  the 
unit  is  in  repeat  mode.  To  cancel  repeat 
mode,  push  the  [FUNCTION]  and  [ENTER] 
keys  simultaneously.

95  scope-meter.  For  frequencies  above  the 
H-P  8054^  535  MHz  limit,  the  signal  genera- 
tor's second  harmonic  was  used.  This  har- 
monic was  measured  and  found  to  be  30  dB 
down  from  the  fundamental  Then  30  dB  was 
subtracted  from  the  signal  level  settings.  All 
graphs  and/or  charts  show  the  corrected  fig-

The  ICOM  IC-W2A  utilizes  dual-conversion 
receivers  with  a  30.85  MHz  1st  IF  (35.80 
MHz  on  UHF}  and  455  kHz  2nd  IF.  Receiver 
sensitivity  measured  0.12  \tV  for  a  12  dB 
SINAD  on  both  2  meters  and  70  centimeters, 
The  20  dB  quieting  level  measured  0.22  jiV. 
Receiver  sensitivity  was  essentially  flat 
across  both  ham  bands,  and  varied  widely 
across  the  extended  receive  range,  as  shown 
in  Figures  1-3.  Image  rejection  measured  72 
dB  on  2  meters  and  77  dB  on  70  centimeters.

On  the  transmit  side  of  things,  peak  devia- 
tion measured  5  kHz  for  voice  and  2.5  kH2 
for  DTMF  tones.  Transmit  frequency  was  20 
Hz  Sow  on  2  meters  and  40  Hz  low  on  70  cen- 
timeters. Maximum  RF  power  output  mea- 
sured 6  watts  at  13.8  volts  and  1.5  watts 
when  using  the  supplied  BP-84  battery  pack. 

Power  consumption  measurements  were 
taken  at  7.2  volts  to  simulate  realistic  current 
drain  on  the  battery  pack  during  typical 
portable  operation.  Where  different  readings 
were  obtained  depending  on  band,  the  first 
value  is  for  the  VHF  unit  and  the  second  val- 
ue (in  parenthesis)  is  for  the  UHF  unit.  Unless 
otherwise  noted,  measurements  were  taken 
with  only  one  band  in  operation.  The  receiver 
drew  50  (70)  mA  during  no-signal  squelched 
state,  150  (170)  mA  for  full  audio  output,  and 
averaged  13  (18)  mA  in  power  saver  mode. 
With  both  receivers  on,  power  consumption 
measured  117  mA  during  standby,  220  mA 
for  full  audio  output,  and  21  mA  in  power 
saver  mode.  Activating  the  backlight  added 
15  mA  to  the  battery  load.  Transmit  current 
measured  410  (625)  mA  at  the  lowest  power 
setting  and  780  (970)  mA  at  the  highest  pow- 
er level.  At  13.8  volts,  transmit  current  mea- 
sured 1 .5  (1.7)  amps  at  maximum  RF  output. 

Real-world  use  tests  were  conducted  over 
a  six-week  period  during  which  the  W2A  was 
used  in  base,  portable,  and  mobile  environ- 
ments. Audio  output  was  ample  for  base  and 
portable  operations,  but  a  little  light  for  mobile 
use  in  a  noisy  vehicle.  The  LCD  display  was 
easy  to  read  from  a  wide  range  of  angles. 
The  dual  LED  backlight  provided  sufficient 
light  to  read  the  display  at  night  Very  few  in- 
termod  products  and  virtually  no  birdies  were 
noted  on  either  band,  even  when  operating  in 
areas  of  high  RF  clutter  around  Springfield, 
Massachusetts  Those  that  did  occur  were 
usually  well  outside  both  ham  bands  in  the 
W2As  extended  receive  range.  The  opera- 
tor's manual  was  relatively  clear  and  easy  to 
understand,  with  only  a  few  confusing  sec- 
tions. 

Although  rt  was  easy  to  inadvertently  hit  a 
key  on  the  crowded  keyboard  and  QSY  to  an- 
other frequency  or  send  the  rig  into  scan 
mode,  the  keylock  feature  proved  extremely 
useful  for  preventing  such  accidents  during 
mobile  operation  by  locking  out  alf  keys  ex- 
cept PTTt  power,  light,  and  hi/low  RF  power. 
The  PTT  lockout  feature  proved  handy  when 
leaving  the  rig  in  the  presence  of  co-workers 
and  other  non-hams,  and  could  be  a  real  plus 
for  hams  with  children.  The  W2A"s  small  size 
and  light  weight  also  made  for  comfortable, 
extended-duration  QSOs  while  commuting  to 
work.  Although  the  metal  rear  cover  became 
fairly  warm  during  long-winded  QSOs,  it  nev- 
er became  uncomfortable  to  the  touch.  The 
W2A's  mechanical  construction  also  ap- 
peared quite  durable;  it  survived  a  few  acci- 
dental drops  of  two  to  four  feet  {definitely  not 
recommended)! 

The  W2A*s  lack  of  sufficient  low-battery 
warning  was  annoying.  The  radio  would  oper* 
ate  flawlessly  right  until  the  battery  went

Async  Comms,  Part  2 
(Finally) 

Whoops!  The  flurry  of  paper,  bits, 
and  phone  calls  here  at  N1EWO  Cen- 
tral Control  sucked  up  this  second  haff 
(continued  from  the  March  1993 
Tacket  &  Computers*  column)  of  our 
async  primer  and  spit  out  the  first  half 
of  a  different  series.  For  those  of  you 
who  got  confused,  it  wasn't  your 
fault — it  was  mine.  So,  the  result  is 
that  we  will  have  interleaved  multipart 
columns  for  this  and  next  month. 

When  we  last  left  our  data.  It  was 
timing  itself— allowing  us  lo  commune 
cate  asynchronously.  Let's  review  a  lit- 
tle. The  term  asynchronous  (async) 
means  "without  the  same  time."  it 
comes  from  the  Latin  roots  "a"  for 
without;  "syn,"  for  the  same;  and 
"chronos™  for  time,  As  you  can  see,  it's 
a  strange  sort  of  word,  It  sets  up  a 
compl tested  idea  and  then  adds  "wit" 
What  this  whole  mess  means  to  digital 
communications  is  that  the  data  on  an 
async  link  does  not  depend  on  a  com- 
mon ^clock'— regulating  signal— lo  fig- 
ure out  each  bit  as  it  goes  by. 

Before  1  completely  confuse  you, 
let's  take  a  step  back.  Why  is  time  im- 
portant at  all?  OKT  binary  communica- 
hons  (that  use  only  two  states — on 
and  oft,  high  or  low,  etc.)  depend  upon 
time  lo  create  combinations  that  can 
be  interpreted  as  characters.  The 
"canvas"  upon  which  the  character  is 
"painted"  is  time,  in  contrast  printed 
communications  use  space  as  their 
medium.  As  you  look  at  written  com- 
munications, you  are  concerned  with 
how  the  marks  or  the  paper  (or  dis- 
play) relate  to  the  space  they  occupy. 
The  terminal's  space  is  time,  tt  con- 
cerns itself  with  the  relationships  that 
the  bits  form  in  time  to  figure  out  their 
content.  This  makes  time  the  medium 
upon  which  the  data  is  written.  Don't 
worry  if  you  don't  get  this,  it  is  not  criti- 
cal to  understanding  this  stuff.  If  you 
do  get  it.  though,  it  will  help  you  under- 
stand. 

So,  we  are  dealing  with  something 
that  happens  over  time.  The  receiving 
station  has  to  know  when  a  bit  (the 
smallest  unit  of  data— a  binary  1  or  0) 
has  gone  by.  You'll  get  a  better  feel  for 
this  it  you  think  of  a  data  stream  that 
has.  say,  seven  fs  m  a  row.  Without 
some  sort  of  timing,  the  receiving  sta- 
tion would  have  no  way  of  telling  that 
this  was  not  just  one  big  I,  since  the 
signal  will  not  change  for  the  duration 
of  the  seven  1  bits.  The  obvious  solu- 
tion is  to  have  one  side  be  in  charge  of 
the  timing.  This  is  called  synchronous 
communications.  In  this  scheme  we 
send  a  standard  clock  signal  along 
with  the  data,  and  the  data  stream  is 

40  73  Amateur  Radio  Today  ■  May, 


interpreted  by  this  timing.  In  our  seven 
1's  example,  seven  ticks  of  the  clock 
would  count  off  the  seven  bits  as  they 
went  by.  This  works  fine,  but  while  it  is 
conceptually  simpler,  it  is  more  compli- 
cated to  implement  on  a  real  data 
channel. 

The  alternative  scheme  is  our  sub- 
j  eel — a  synch  ron  ou  s  co  m  m  u  nicat  ions . 
The  name.  asyncT  is  a  bit  contusing. 
While  it  Implies  that  time  is  not  impor- 
tant, this  is  not  true.  What  it  really 
means  is  that  there  is  no  master  dock, 
The  data  is  setf-timing.  Each  async 
character  has  what  are  called  "fram- 
ing* bits.  These  are  the  start  and  Stop 
bits  that  you  are  probably  familiar  wfth 
from  setting  in  your  communications 
software,  or  even  from  using  dip 
switches  inside  a  dumb  terminal. 
These  framing  bits  let  the  receiving 
station  know  that  the  character  has 
started  and  stopped.  This  makes  each 
async  character  its  own  clock,  Well,  at 
least  lo  a  point.  You  still  need  to  know 
at  what  speed  the  data  is  being  sent.  It 
isn't  a  free-for-alL  The  framing  bits  let 
the  receiver  synchronize)  to  the  bit 
sequence.  There  are  standard  data 
rales  that  must  match, 

Back  to  Earth 

So.  what's  the  practical  upshot  of 
this  academic  stuff?  For  those  with  a 
nuts-and  botts  bent,  it  means  that  for 
the  TNC  and  computer  to  successfully 
communicate  they  must  be  set  to  the 
same  data  parameters.  The  most 
common  setting,  and  the  first  to  try  if 
you  don't  know  what  Is  the  right  com- 
bination, is  7£1.  7E1  is  shorthand  for 
7  data  bits,  Even  Parity.  1  Stop  bit. 
Let's  break  that  down. 

7  Data  Bits 

This  means  that  the  characters  are 
made  up  of  7  bits.  This  is  fine  for  the 
standard  ASCII  (American  Standard 
Code  for  Information  Interchange) 
character  set.  Seven  bits  allows  for 
126  different  combinations — in  this 
case  characters.  This  is  fine  for  most 
communications,  but  for  graphics 
characters  (which  are  in  the  extended 
ASCII  set)  or  binary  file  transfer,  which 
uses  all  255  combinations  that  the  8 
bits  of  a  byte  atlow.  (Note:  Binary  file 
transfer  using  7  bits  is  possible,  but  it 
requires  special  software  to  encode 
and  decode  the  information  on  each 
end.)  Seven  bits  is  the  de  facto  stan- 
dard because  it  is  usually  all  that  is 
needed,  but  8  bits  is  a  possible  value 
as  well 

Even  Parity 

The  parity  bit  is  used  for  error  de- 
tection. You  are  unlikely  to  actually 
find  software  that  does  anything  with  it 
other  than  report  an  error.  In  other 
words,  ft  is  not  used  lor  error  correc- 
tion, fn  any  case,  it  works  likes  this: 

1993 


The  bits  in  the  data  are  added  togeth- 
er and  the  parity  bit  Is  set  to  a  value 
that  will  make  the  result  either  even  or 
odd,  depending  upon  the  setting.  For 
example,  in  the  case  of  an  "e"  the  data 
bits.  "1100101."  add  up  to  four  This 
means  that  for  even  parity  the  parity 
bit  gets  set  lo  zero.  This  is  because 
four  is  an  even  number  If  the  parity 
were  set  to  Odd,  the  parity  bit  in  this 
case  would  be  one— which  added  to 
four  makes  the  odd  five.  Your  main 
concern  with  parity  is  to  set  il  the 
same  on  both  ends. 

1  Stop  Bit 

The  slop  bit  is  the  complement  of 
the  start  bit.  Every  async  character 
has  a  start  bit  and  at  least  one  stop 
bit.  You  can  set  stop  bits  to  2,  though. 
Again,  your  main  concern  is  lo  match 
the  two  ends. 

The  Speed  of  Things 

As  I  mentioned  before,  the  rate  of 
the  data  transmission  must  also  match 
on  both  ends.  Data  rate  is  measured 
in  bps  (bits  per  second).  It  is  also 
measured  in  bauds  {named  for  J  ME. 
Baudot,  a  French  engineer  from  the 
1800s).  These  two  can  be— but  are 
not  necessarily—the  same.  A  baud  is 
a  state  change  or  transition — say  from 
on  to  off.  A  baud  can  transmit  one  or 
more  bits.  In  the  simplest  case,  bps  = 
bauds  because  one  bit  is  sent  for  each 
transition.  This  win  be  the  case  For  the 
connection  between  your  terminal  and 
TNC.  As  soon  as  we  start  to  discuss 
modems  with  data  rates  higher  than 
1200  bps.  the  picture  changes. 

Because  modems  work  by  chang- 
ing data  to  audio  and  back  again,  the 
bandwidth  (frequency  range)  with 
which  they  have  to  work  puts  a  limit  on 
how  many  bauds  (transitions  per  sec- 
ond) they  can  transmit,  Most  modems 
are  designed  to  work  on  velce  chan- 
nels which  offer  a  bandwidth  of  about 
3000  Hz,  So  to  get  around  the  rela- 
tively narrow  bandwidth,  high-speed 
modems  use  a  technique  that  com- 
bines the  frequency  information  of  the 
signal  (FSK — Frequency  Shift  Keying), 
and  the  phase  information  (PSK — 
phase  shift  keying).  This  scheme  is 
called  trellis  encoding.  It  uses  combi- 
nations of  frequency  and  phase  in  a 
table  that  resembles  a  trellis,  hence 
the  name.  This  approach  allows  more 
than  one  bit  of  information  to  be  en- 
coded into  each  transition— or  greater 
than  one  bit/baud. 

Practically  speaking,  you  need  to 
make  sure  that  each  end  of  the  data 
link  is  set  to  the  same  speed.  What 
should  this  be?  My  general  purpose 
recommendation  is  9600  baud.  A 
good  question  ts,  "If  the  on-lhe-air  da- 
ta is  only  going  1200,  why  set  the 
co mm  link  at  96007"  Well,  if  the  only 
data  that  was  sent  over  the  link  was 
from  the  on-the-air  link,  that  might 
make  sense.  But  the  TNC  sends  sta- 
tus messages,  mail,  and  other  traffic 
to  the  terminal*  tl  is  much  more  pleas- 
ant to  work  with  the  TNC  at  the  higher 
data  rate.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  not  a 
requirement.  While  you  might  experi- 
ence difficulties — like  buffer  overflow — 


if  you  set  the  link  below  1200  baud,  it 
is  not  necessary  to  set  it  higher  than 
1200 — it  will  wort?  line  there. 

The  next  part  ol  this  series  will  ap- 
pear in  two  months.  I  will  cover  the 
software  side  ot  this  contusing  but  vital

ICOM IC-W2A 

Continued  from  page  39 
dead,  giving  virtually  no  warning  whatsoever. 
When  the  battery  finally  did  run  down,  the  on* 
ly  warning  was  a  howling  or  oscillation  in  re- 
ceive mode  or  a  transmitter  which  cycled  on 
and  off  if  the  PTT  key  was  pressed.  Once  ei- 
ther of  these  events  occurred ,  there  wasn't 
enough  juice  left  in  the  battery  to  even  sign 
off!  On  two  occasions  1  was  unable  to  shut  off 
the  radio  with  the  power  button  (which  ties  in- 
to the  CPU  and  is  not  a  hard-wired  power 
switch)-  The  only  way  to  get  the  unit  to  stop 
howling  or  keying  was  to  remove  the  battery 
pack.  It  would  have  been  nice  had  ICOM 
used  the  front  panel  status  LED  to  warn  of  an 
imminent  dead  battery  condition  a  minute  or 
so  before  the  rig  actually  goes  dead,  as  was 
done  in  the  IC-273/4AT  series  of  handhelds. 

My  biggest  disappointment  with  the  ICOM 
IC-W2A  was  its  limited  transmit  frequency 
coverage  on  the  70  cm  band.  The  W2A  trans- 
mits between  440  and  450  MH2  only.  With  its 
full  crossband  duplex  modes,  this  HT  would 
have  made  an  excellent  basis  for  a  portable 
OSCAR  AO~21  platform,  had  not  the  435 
MHz  FM  uplink  frequency  been  locked  out  of 
the  transmit  range.  A  call  to  ICOM's  tech  line 
confirmed  that  there  was  a  mod  available  to 
open  the  transmit  range,  but  ICOM  would  not 
reveal  the  mod,  stating  that  it  was  a  "dealer 
mod."  A  call  to  two  dealers  proved  fruitless, 
while  a  third  dealer  offered  to  perform  the 
modification  for  a  fee,  but  only  if  a  MARS  or 
CAP  license  was  presented.  ICOM  would  do 
well  to  provide  a  simple  mod  or  upgrade  the 
programming  to  enable  transmit  in  the  430  to 
440  MHz  range.  With  an  HT  this  advanced, 
they  have  truly  limited  its  potential  and 
missed  a  golden  opportunity  to  introduce 
users  to  satellite  communications. 

Other  drawbacks  were  minor,  but  equally 
irritating.  These  included  an  oddball  DC  pow- 
er connector,  the  likes  of  which  I  have  never 
seen  anywhere  other  than  on  the  pages  of  an 
ICOM  accessory  catalog.  Although  the  bat- 
tery packs  are  interchangeable  between  the 
W2A  and  the  24AT,  forget  the  speaker  mike 
or  headset  units.  If  you've  ever  charged  an 
ICOM  BP-4  in  a  BC-30  charger,  you'll  be  as 
surprised  as  I  was  to  discover  that  the  W2A's 


BP-90  battery  cases  cannot  be  recharged  in 
a  drop-in  charger.  Finally,  the  shape  of  the 
belt  clip  made  it  virtually  impossible  to  hook 
the  radio  on  a  back  pocket  with  one  hand*  At- 
tempting to  do  so  was  an  exercise  in  aggra- 
vation. The  shape  of  the  clip  caused  ft  to  pre- 
fer plowing  through  material  rather  than  slid- 
ing over  it.  The  only  way  to  engage  the  clip 
was  to  use  one  hand  to  pull  on  the  pocket 
and  place  the  material  under  tension,  and 
use  the  other  hand  to  force  the  clip  down 
over  the  pocket  lip. 

A  Bargain 

All  things  taken  into  consideration,  the  best 
way  to  sum  up  the  ICOM  W2A  is  to  call  it  a 
bargain.  Although  $500  is  not  cheap  for  an 
HTr  one  must  remember  that  the  W2A  is  basi- 
cally two  completely  independent  single-band 
radios  sharing  a  single  case,  and  is  capable 
of  doing  anything  two  separate  HTs  could  do, 
except  transmit  on  both  bands  simultaneous- 
ly. The  BP-84  heavy-duty  battery  and  the  in- 
cluded PL  encode/decode  board  make  the 
radio  quite  an  attractive  value.  Toss  in  the 
wideband  receive  modification,  and  if  s  like 
getting  a  portable  scanner  for  freel 

The  ICOM  W2A  is  not  for  everybody.  With 
so  many  features  packed  into  such  a  smail 
package,  plan  on  spending  at  least  four  or 
five  hours  with  the  owner's  manual  learning 
what  all  those  double  and  triple  function  but- 
tons  do.  It  took  me  about  a  week  to  learn  my 
way  around  all  the  features  and  extras 
packed  into  this  little  HT.  For  those  willing  to 
take  the  time  to  read  and  understand  the 
manual  the  W2A  is  an  exceptional  rig. 

Rating  this  HT  on  a  scale  of  one  to  10  was 
difficult.  Receiver  sensitivity,  frequency  cover- 
age, features,  ease  of  use,  layout,  appear- 
ance, and  performance  all  deserved  a  solid 
10.  However,  I  could  not  overlook  the  unit's 
inability  to  transmit  on  legitimate  430  MHz 
satellite  FM  uplink  frequencies,  nor  the  diffi- 
culty experienced  in  trying  to  get  it  to  do  so. 
The  incompatibility  of  some  accessories  be- 
tween the  W2  and  24AT,  along  with  the  weird 
power  connector  and  lack  of  any  advanced 
low-battery  warning  also  pulled  down  the 
overall  rating.  On  a  scale  of  1  to  1 0,  I  would 
rate  the  ICOM  IOW2A  at  8-1/2.

An  Everything  Amplifier 

Continued  from  page  28 

Results 

Ai  223  MHz  the  amplifier  will  put  out 
more  power  than  is  legal  tor  Novice  opera- 
tors. However,  this  power  can  be  backed  up 
to  the  legal  25  watts  by  adjusting  R3, 1  tested 
this  amplifier  with  my  1.25  meter  handie- 
talkie,  2  meter  handie-talkie,  6  meter 
transceiver,  10  meter  mobile  rig,  a  10  MHz 
home-brew  transmitter,  and  an  HF  rig  at  3.5, 
7,  10,  14,  17,  21,  24,  and  28  MHz.  The  amp 
does  not  work  well  at  3  J  MHz,  but  it  does  at 
ihe  other  frequencies  tested.  At  HF  frequen- 
cies with  only  13  volts  from  the  power  sup- 
ply, 1  watt  input  gives  a  little  more  than  30 
watts  oul  One  point  cannot  be  emphasized 
enough:  Do  not  put  more  than  25  watts  into 
this  amplifier — so  be  careful  if  you  test  this 
amplifier  with  a  transmitter  that  is  capable  of 
putting  out  more  power  than  that, 

If  the  amp  is  used  for  SSB,  the  relay  may 
not  want  to  stay  engaged.  It  may  be  neces- 
sary to  manually  key  the  relay  if  you're  going 
to  use  the  amp  on  SSB  or  lo  design  a  circuit 
that  will  delay  the  relay  from  opening  once  it 
closes. 

As  the  power  supply  voltage  is  changed, 
the  bias  will  sometimes  have  to  be  adjusted. 
Furthermore,  bias  sometimes  has  to  be 
changed  if  you  go  from  one  band  to  one  of  a 
much  different  frequency.  The  power  gain  of 
a  broadband  amplifier  will  go  up  at  the  lower 
frequencies,  and  if  you  switch  to  a  lower  fre- 
quency with  no  adjustment,  the  amp  may  go 
into  oscillation. 

Receive  sensitivity  is  slightly  reduced — es- 
pecially at  the  higher  frequencies.  If  you 
want  to  get  the  receive  sensitivity  back  up  to 
the  level  it  would  be  without  the  amplifier, 
consider  installing  a  broadband  prcamp. 

Remember  that  FCC  regulations,  common 
courtesy,  and  good  operating  practice  re- 
quire the  use  of  minimum  power  when  oper- 
ating on  the  airwaves.  Also  remember  that 
experimentation  is  one  of  the  main  reasons 
for  our  hobby. 

My  thanks  to  the  XYL,  Carolyn  KC4NBE, 
who  encouraged  me  in  the  project  and  proof- 
read  the  manuscript.  Also  thanks  to  Will 
Payne  N4YWK,  who  worked  with  me  on  the 
project  and  gave  me  tips  that  enabled  the 
amplifier  to  work.

Electronic  Project 
Panel  Labels 

Let  your  computer  help. 

by  Marion  D.  Kitchens  K4GOK 


After  finishing  the  electronics  on  your 
^latest  project,  the  next  matter  ai  hand  is 
a  suitable  enclosure,  followed  immediately 
by  the  problem  of  labeling.  How  do  you 
make  your  electronic  marvel  look  like  a  pro- 
fessional piece  of  work?  There  are  a  number 
of  different  ways  to  accomplish  that  task,  all 
with  various  degrees  of  difficulty  and  vary- 
ing qualities  of  results.  Many  hams  resolve 
this  problem  with  rub-on  lettering,  stick- on 
tape  Labels,  etc. 

With  the  advent  of  desktop  publishing  on 
personal  computers,  there  is  another  way 
that  is  quick  and  easy,  and  produces  top 
quality  results.  The  desktop  publishing  tech- 
nique has  several  advantages  over  other 
methods.  It  allows  you  to  design  the  panel 


electronically,  so  changes  are  easy  to  make 
without  the  hassle  of  physically  changing 
things.  This  way  you  can  get  the  layout  ex- 
actly the  way  you  want  il,  before  "cutting 
metal."  The  only  limit  to  the  degree  of  detail 
and  complexity  is  your  imagination:  You 
can  put  whatever  you  want  on  the  panel,  in- 
cluding graphic  images,  If  you  can  do  it  on 
the  computer,  you  can  put  it  on  a  panel. 

As  a  practical  matter,  a  printed  copy  of 
the  panel  layout  can  be  used  as  a  template 
for  drilling  holes  and  making  cutouts  on  the 
physical  panel.  This  assures  proper  align- 
ment and  location  of  switches,  jacks,  indica- 
tor lights,  etc. 

This  article  describes  the  desktop  publish- 
ing method  and  the  resolution  of  the  pitfalls 


the  author  encountered.  Hams  who  build 
electronics  projects  are  encouraged  to  ''dress 
them  up"  with  professional-looking  panels 
and  labeling. 

Making  a  Panel 

I  recommend  making  an  initial  rough  pen- 
cil layout  of  the  panel.  Make  sure  that  you 
plan  for  all  the  switches,  control  functions 
and  the  like  that  the  project  either  does  have, 
or  may  have  in  the  future.  Leave  room  for 
additions  or  embellishments  to  your  project 
See  Photo  D  for  an  example  of  a  rear  panel 
showing  jacks  for  just  such  future  embellish- 
ments. 

Use  your  favorite  desktop  publishing  soft- 
ware lo  make  a  full-size  layout  of  the  panel.

Photo  E.  A  painted  panel  with  the  film  in  place,  ready  for  cutting  to  shape  and  drilling. 


Make  sure  you  have  it  the  way  you  want  it: 
The  finished  product  will  be  exactly  like  ihat 
in  the  computer.  Print  out  a  copy  of  the  fin- 
ished  layout  to  be  sure  it  is  OK.  For  best  re- 
sults, I  recommend  a  laser  primer,  but  9-pin 
dot  matrix  printers  can  also  produce  quite 
good  products-  The  "CONSTANT  CUR- 
RENT* panel  shown  in  Photo  A  was  done 
with  a  9-pin  dot  matrix  printer. 

Take  your  final  artwork  to  your  local  copy 
shop.  Make  a  copy  on  paper,  and  a  copy  on 
transparent  stick-on  flfm  The  film  used  for 
making  the  "FREQUENCY  MASTER"  pan- 
el shown  in  Photo  B  was  called  Graphic  Ap- 
plique Film.  It  wras  the  brand  ofTered  by  my 
local  copy  shop,  and  should  be  available 
widely.  It  works  well,  without  stretching  or 
distortion  during  application. 

[  recommend  completing  all  the  metal 
work  and  painting  before  applying  the  film. 


This  results  in  the  best-looking  panel,  but  it 
also  requires  careful  alignment  of  the  film 
before  sticking  it  in  place.  The  film  slicks 
tightly  and  can  pull  the  paint  off  if  it  is  lifted 
for  realignment.  Use  the  paper  copy  for 
drilling  and  cutting  the  panel.  Rubber  ce- 
ment works  great  for  sticking  the  paper  copy 
to  the  metal  panel.  I  found  out  the  hard  way 
that  "100%*'  size  on  most  copy  machines  is 
not  actually  10(KI.  But  if  you  use  the  paper 
copy,  it  will  be  the  same  size  as  the  film  you 
will  be  applying  later.  When  cutting  the  pan- 
el from  the  material  you  use  (I  used  double- 
clad  PCB  here),  leave  a  small  lab  on  one 
end.  I  left  about  3/4"  on  the  end  of  the 
"FREQUENCY  MASTER"  panel  (Photo 
B)+  This  tab  serves  as  a  place  to  stick  the 
film  down  while  aligning  it  with  the  panel 
Cut  off  the  tab  after  applying  the  film* 

Alternatively,  the  film  can  be  applied  be* 


fore  drilling  and  cutting  the  panel.  If  you  use 
this  technique,  sharp  drills  and  cutting  tools 
must  be  used  to  prevent  damaging  the  film 
during  that  operation. 

Apply  the  film  by  aligning  it  carefully  and 
sticking  it  down  to  the  tab,  Bend  the  film  so 
that  the  stiff  backing  will  "unroll/*  and  rub 
the  film  down  with  your  finger  as  it  is  comes 
in  contact  with  the  painted  panel.  Sec  Photo 
C  Apply  only  a  small  area  at  a  lime.  Make 
sure  all  the  small  air  bubbles  are  rubbed  out 
as  you  go.  Any  trapped  air  will  not  come  out 
later  It  is  important  that  the  air  be  rubbed 
out  as  the  film  is  applied. 

The  edges  of  the  film  can  either  be  rolled 
around  the  edges  of  the  panel  and  stuck  to 
the  backside,  or  trimmed  neatly  to  the  panel 
edges  with  a  sharp  X-acto  knife.  I  recom- 
mend putting  a  thin  bead  of  white  glue 
around  the  trimmed  edges  to  prevent  clumsy 
handling  from  lifting  the  film  during  use. 

The  film  needs  no  protection  for  normal 
handling— the  lettering  seems  to  be  durable, 
Once  the  film  is  applied  to  the  painted  panel 
it  is  ready  for  use. 

Using  the  desktop  publishing  technique 
produces  craftsman-quality  labeling  for 
home-brew  electronic  projects.  The  results 
are  comparable  with  rub-on  lettering  and  In- 
dia ink,  and  can  be  achieved  with  consider- 
ably less  time  and  effort.  I  recommend  this 
technique  for  all  who  enjoy  building  elec- 
tronic  projects.

Home-Brewing  Your  Own 
RF  Filters 

Radio  frequency  filters  are  inductor- 
capacitor  networks  that  pass  one  band 
of  frequencies,  while  rejecting  all  other 
frequencies.  Hams  use  RF  filters  in  a 
wide  variety  of  applications:  keeping 
harmonics  at  the  transmitter,  prevent- 
ing outnDf-band  signals  from  getting  in- 
to the  receiver,  etc.  There  are  four  ba- 
sic types:  low-pass  filters  (LPF),  high- 
pass  filters  (HPF),  band-pass  filters 
(8PF)  and  rejection  filters  {called  notch 
filters  when  the  rejection  band  is  nar- 
row, and  bandstop  filters  when  the  re- 
jection band  is  wider). 

The  LPF  and  HPF  frequency  re- 
sponses are  shown  in  Figures  1A  and 
IB,  respectively.  In  the  LPF  (Figure 
1A},  aU  signals  from  DC  to  some  cut- 
off frequency  (Fc)  are  passed,  but 
above  Fc  the  response  falls  off  to  the 


point  where  there  is  little  signal  pass- 
ing. The  cut-olf  frequency  is  usually 
defined  as  the  point  where  the  fre- 
quency response  falls  off  -3  dB  from 
the  in-band  response.  The  HPF  char- 
acteristic is  shown  in  Figure  IB,  and  is 
exactly  the  opposite  of  the  LPF:  It  re- 
jects all  frequencies  below  its  cut-off 
frequency,  while  passing  all  frequen-

deed.  But  if  you  use  tables  of  values 
for  "normalized"  generic  filters,  then 
the  job  becomes  a  lot  easier .  .  .  and 
certainly  falls  into  the  "easily  do-able" 
category,  I  recently  tried  my  hand  at  a 
number  of  RF  filters  for  different  pur- 
poses, only  some  of  which  are  related 


"The  fitter  projects  turned  out  so  welt 
that  I  am  convinced  it  is  another  case  of  <

cies  above  Fc.  Note  that  these  curves 
are  a  bit  idealized;  real  HF  filters  are 
not  so  smooth  either  in  the  passband 
or  outside  it, 

if  you  start  "raw"  and  design  your 
own  filter,  then  the  task  is  daunting  in- 


to ham  radio  but  all  of  which  illustrate 
the  principles  involved.  You  can  also 
use  the  same  method  to  design  fiflers 
for  your  own  purposes. 

I  had  several  projects  in  mind  when 
f  built  some  fitters.  First.  J  needed  both

HPF  and  LPF  designs  with  overlapping 
cut-off  frequencies  of  3t00Q  kHz  or  so 
{the  exact  frequency  was  not  critical). 
Second,  I  needed  an  8,000  kHz  LPF 
for  a  smalt  40  meter  1.5-watt  power 
oscillator  that  1  was  building.  Finally,  I 
needed  an  LPF  that  would  reject  the 
AM  broadcast  band,  while  passing 
LF/VLF  signals.  For  these  projects  I 
turned  to  the  ARRL  Handbook  for  the 
normalized  tables.  The  circuits  are 
found  on  page  2*51  in  the  1993  edi- 
tion, while  the  tables  are  found  on 
pages  2-51  and  2-52.  Figure  2  shows 
the  basic  LPF  circuit,  while  Figure  3 
shows  the  HPF  case  (both  use  the  part 
designations  found  in  the  ARRL  Hand- 
book}* 

The  tables  give  the  values  for  the 
normalized  case  where  Fc  =  1  MHz; 
the  inductances  are  given  in  microhen- 
rys  (jiH)  and  the  capacitances  in  pico- 
farads (pF). 

Example:  The  Low-Pass  Case 

In  this  example  let's  look  at  my 
3,000  kHz  LPF.  It  was  used  in  a  sweep 
signal  generator  that  I  designed  for  the 
AM  broadcast  band,  and  for  common 
AM  IF  frequencies  (e.g.  455  kHz),  I 
needed  it  to  facilitate  a  project  that  1 
am  working  on:  a  super  AM  DXer's  re- 
ceiver (sorry,  no  details  as  yet),  A  por- 
tion of  the  normalized  1  MHz  data  from 
Table  20.  p,  2-52.  is  shown  in  Table  1. 

The  number  of  elements  in  the 
complete  table  varied  from  three  to 
nine  (odd  numbers),  but  because  this 
filter  has  two  capacitors  and  three  in- 
ductors, only  the  frve-etement  data  is 
reproduced  (see  the  book  for  the  com- 
plete table,  as  well  as  those  for  the 
HPF  and  other  designs).  The  ripple  da- 
ta refers  to  the  maximum  rippie  in  the 
passband  of  the  filter,  and  is  ex- 
pressed in  decibels  (dB).  I  selected  the 
0,1  dB  figures. 

The  table  data  are  normalized  to  1 
MHz,  so  to  find  the  values  of  induc- 
tance and  capacitance  needed  for  the 
actual  filter  divide  the  values  in  the  da- 
ta table  by  the  frequency  in  megahertz 
(MHz).  To  find  the  values  for  my  3.000 
kHz  (Le.  3  MHz),  0.1  dB  ripple  LPF  I 
divided  the  ARRL  Handbook  values  by 
three: 

CI  -  C2  =  4364.7/3  =  1454.9  pF;  L1  = 

L3  =  9.126/3  =  3.04  ^H;  L2  =  5.24  |iK

erate  from  2  to  30  MHz,  while  the  T- 
50-15  (RED/WHT)  have  an  AL  of  135 
and  operate  over  G,t  to  2  MHz,  In 
practice,  I  found  thai  3  MHz  was  not 
unreasonable  for  the  -15  cores,  so  I 
opted  to  use  them.  Applying  ihe  formu- 
la below  gave  the  number  of  turns:

L2:  5.24  jiH.  20  turns.  T-5CM5  (RED/WHT) 

The  capacitors  are  another  matter. 
Where  in  blazes  do  you  get  a  1454.9 
pF  capacitor?  Well  one  solution  is  to 
use  a  0.0015  *iF  [1,500  pF)  and  Live 
with  the  slight  frequency  error  I  did 
this  and  found  lhat  the  filter  had  a  cut- 
off frequency  only  slightly  lower  than 


3.000  kHz,  and  it  was  acceptable.  Oth- 
erwise, it  is  possible  to  select  siandard 
value  capacitors  that  in  some  series  or 
parallel  combination  totat  1454.9  pR  or 
something  close  to  it.  For  example,  75 
pF.  560  pF,  and  820  pF  add  up  to  1455 
pFt  and  All  are  easily  available  values. 

The  capacitors  used  in  the  filter 
should  be  NPO  disk  ceramic,  silvered 
mica,  or  polyethelene,  I  bought  several 
dozen  of  ail  types  recently  from  Ocean 
State  Electronics  [P.O,  Box  1458,  6 
Industrial  Drive,  Westerly  Rl  02891; 
phones:  1-800-866-6626  {orders), 
401-596-3080  (inside  Rl),  or  401-596- 
3590  (Fax)].  Ask  them  for  their  catalog 
.  .  .  you'll  find  a  lot  of  ham  building 
parts  that  you  thought  were  "history" 
because  other  parts  distributors  no 


longer  cany  them. 

Another  approach  is  to  use  a  com- 
bination of  fixed -value  and  trimmer  ca- 
pacitors in  the  filter.  This  is  a  viable  ap- 
proach if  you  have  a  sweep  generator 
and  oscilloscope  to  align  the  filter,  but 
can  be  a  "bear"  if  you  don't  A  proce- 
dure for  alignment  of  such  filters  is  giv- 
en in  Hayward  and  DeMaw's  Sofid- 
State  Design  for  the  Radio  Amateur 
(an  ARRL  publication), 

The  filter  projects  turned  out  so  well 
that  I  am  convinced  it  is  another  case 
of "...  the  oontnVing  of  contrivances 
is  a  game  for  all"

Amateur  Radio  Via  Satellites

SSTV  From  Space 

Only  10  days  after  Ihe  launch  of 
AMSAT-OSCAR-6  in  October  1972, 
Don  Miller  W9NTP  wrote  a  letter  to 
the  editor  of  the  AMSAT  Newsletter 
describing  his  efforts  with  WA9UHV 
to  send  slow-scan  television  Images 
via  the  new  satellite. 

In  his  tetter  Don  described  sys- 
tems that  included  equipment  that 
might  be  found  in  a  ham  radio  muse- 
um  today,  but  20  years  ago  repre- 
sented state-of-the-art  gear.  HF 
transmitters  with  transverters  and 
home-brew  video  samplers  and  mod- 
ulators provided  uplink  signals,  while 
more  home-brew  equipment  was 
used  to  view  the  black-and-white  im- 
ages sent  through  the  Mode  "A"  (2 
meters  up  and  10  meters  down) 
transponder.  These  pioneering  efforts 
have  provided  inspiration  for  todays 
video  experiments  and  some  excep- 
tional possibilities  for  later  this 
decade. 

In  his  mid-seventies  book,  OSCAR 
Amateur  Radio  Satellites,  SI  rails 
Caramanolls  recounted  efforts  by 
OL8AT  and  OE3KMA  to  send  SSTV 
pictures  via  the  Mode  "B"  (70  cm  up 
and  2  meters  down)  transponder  on 
AMSAT~OSCAFh7,  The  year  was 
1976  and  eight-second,  black-and- 
white  pictures  were  still  the  standard. 
These  efforts  led  to  additional  image 
transfer  techniques  including  facsimi- 
le (FAX)  transmissions  by  DL0VS 
and  others. 

During  the  1980s  emphasis  was 
placed  on  ihe  purely  digital  modes 
like  AX. 25  packet.  Today  we  have 


saveral  digital-only  satellites  in  orbit, 
capable  of  providing  worldwide  store- 
and-forward  services.  Sending  image 
files  via  these  electronic  bulletin 
boards  in  the  sky  has  become  com- 
mon. Real -lime  image  exchange  via 
satellite  declined,  but  thanks  to  ad- 
vances in  inexpensive  digital  inter- 
face techniques  and  individual  ef- 
forts, SSTV  operation  is  again  gain- 
ing popularity, 

SAREX  and  SSTV 

Dr.  Tony  England  W0ORE  took 
the  Shuttle  Amateur  Radio  Experi- 
ment (SAREX)  equipment  to  orbit  on 
ihe  shuttle  Challenger  in  August 
1985.  Part  of  the  ham  gear  included 
a  modified  ROBOT  1200C  scan  con- 
verter for  SSTV.  The  image -control 
software  on  the  shuttle  supplied  auto- 
matic sequencing,  providing  two  red- 
filtered  frames  (8  sec),  one  green 
and  one  blue;  a  low-resolution  color 
frame  (12  sec.);  and  a  high- resolution 
color  image  {36  sec.).  Many  stations 
monitored  the  signals  using  home- 
brew SSTV  systems  or  new  and  ex- 
pensive ROBOT  equipment.  Others 
simply  recorded  the  warbling  tones  in 
hopes  of  someday  decoding  the 
cryptic  sounds  and  viewing  the  pic- 
tures. 

Further  experiments  with  SSTV 
from  the  shuttle  continued  on  mis- 
sions STS-37  and  STS-50.  The 
equipment  will  be  earned  on  STS-56 
and  other  future  flights. 

In  addition  to  sending  pictures 
earthward,  the  shuttle  apparatus  can 
also  receive  and  display  images  sent 
from  earth-bound  hams.  During  Tony 
England's  flight,  a  picture  of  the  as- 
tronauts' wives  was  sent  up  to  space 
and  displayed  on  one  of  the  monitors 


Photo  A,  A  36-second  ROBOT  color  image  of  Tony  England  W0ORE  on  the 
Space  Shuttle  Challenger— A ugust  1985. 


located  in  the  Aft  Crew  Station.  The 
picture  was  stored  and  sent  back  to 
earth  a  few  minutes  later.  During 
STS-50P  schools  with  suitable  SSTV 
gear  sent  pictures  of  the  students  up 
to  Dick  Richards  KB5SIW  and  the 
other  ham  crew  members  on  board 
the  Columbia. 

There  are  advantages  and  disad- 
vantages to  shuttle-based  SSTV  op- 
eration. On  the  plus  side,  the  signals 
are  sent  via  2  meter  FM  transceivers. 
Signals  are  strong  and  color  errors 
caused  by  frequency  shift  experi- 
enced using  SSB  are  not  a  problem. 
The  greatest  disadvantage  is  the 
length  of  time  available  for  picture 
exchange.  Shuttle  passes  are  usually 
very  short,  10-15  minutes.  The 
ROBOT  equipment  is  capable  of  a 
72-second  mode,  but  images  are 
usually  sent  in  the  36-second  mode 
to  allow  the  exchange  of  as  many 
pictures  as  possible.  The  ROBOT 
gear  is  also  limited  to  those  ROBOT 


modes  hard-coded  in  the  scan 
converter 

SSTV  and  the  PC 

PC-SSTV  interfaces  have  lagged 
behind  those  lor  other  machines  like 
the  Amiga,  and  only  a  few  dedicated 
hams  have  been  able  to  buy  a 
ROBOT  1200C  at  over  $1,000  for 
computer-less  operation.  Although 
the  Amiga  computer  and  appropriate 
interface  cost  less  than  a  ROBOT, 
those  already  heavily  invested  in 
PC -compatible  machines  (most  of 
us)  don't  consider  either  a  viable 
alternative. 

Early  attempts  to  provide  SSTV 
support  on  PCs  required  the  use  of 
the  cassette  port  to  input  the  tones. 
Rough,  blocky,  black-and-white 
pictures  could  be  seen  from  the 
eight-second  format  frames  on 
monochrome  monitors.  The  soft- 
ware was  crude  and  the  results  poor. 
Better  interfaces,  faster  machines

and  improved  video  were  needed. 
Recent  offerings  have  certainly 
helped. 

For  the  satellite  enthusiast  looking 
to  get  results  without  a  significant  in- 
vestment, there  are  two  inexpensive 
PC-S5TV  interfaces  available. 

The  first  is  the  Viewport  VGA  from 
A  &  A  Engineering.  This  unit  was  de- 
scribed in  a  construction  article  by 
J.  R.  Montalbano  KA2PYJ  in  the 
August  1992  issue  of  73.  A  complete 
kit  from  A  &  A  Engineering  (tele- 
phone: 714-952-2114)  sells  for  $169. 
This  unit  transmits  all  Ihe  ROBOT 
modes  through  72-second  color  and 
receives  ROBOT  plus  Scottie  and 
Martin  formats.  Recent  modifications 
also  allow  operation  with  a  new  FAX 
mode  defined  by  Ralph  Taggart 
WB8DQT  in  the  February  1993  issue 
of  QST  The  Viewport  VGA  is  an  ex- 
ternal interface  box  that  connects  to 
the  PC  through  the  printer  pod 

The  second  recent  offering  for  PC 
owners  looking  for  a  way  to  do  SSTV 
is  the  Pasokon-TV  interface  card  and 
software.  The  card  uses  a  slot  in  the 
PC  (286  or  better)  and  provides  full 
transceive  operation  with  all  of  the 
popular  SSTV  modes,  including 
ROBOT.  Scottie,  Martin  and  others. 
The  kit  costs  $200  and  is  available 
from  John  Langner  VYB20SZ  at  (508) 
256-6907. 


Hamsat  SSTV 

Most  SSTV  operation  via  satellite 
is  currently  on  AMSAT-OSCAR-13 
using  ROBOT  72-second  color.  Ac- 
tivity is  usually  heard  during  times 
when  the  satellite  signals  are 
strongest,  This  is  when  the  satellite's 
antennas  favor  the  earth.  Dave 
WB6LLO  promotes  an  informal  SSTV 
net  for  weekend  activity  via  modes 
B  and  J  (2  meters  up  and  70  cm 
down).  The  "B"  downlink  is  145.960 


via  satellite  the  problem  of  "skip*  is 
not  present.  In  fact,  due  to  the  nature 
ol  full  duplex  satellite  activity,  you  can 
monitor  your  own  signal  as  it  is  being 
heard  by  other  ground  stations  The 
only  disadvantage  to  SSTV  via  A-O- 
13  is  the  noise,  Many  stations  do  not 
have  antenna  systems  for  noise-free 
copy  of  SSTV.  and  since  SSTV  is  a 
100  percent  duty  cycle  mode  and 
should  not  be  run  at  fufl  power  on  the 
transmit  side,  signals  are  not  like  the 


The  advantage  of  satellite  SSTV 

is  the  tack  of  interference. 

While  coverage  is  worldwide, 

the  congestion  is  much  easier 

to  take  than  on  HE  " 


MHz  and  the  "J"  downiink  is  435.980 
MHz. 

The  advantage  of  satellite  SSTV  Is 
the  lack  of  Interference-  While  cover- 
age is  worldwide,  the  congestion  is 
much  easier  to  take  than  on  HF.  The 
odds  of  a  station  ruining  a  good  pic- 
ture by  tuning  up  or  talking  over  it  are 
very  smalL  Unlike  the  shortwave 
bands  where  everyone  cannot  hear 
each  other  on  a  particular  frequency, 


blockbusters  sometimes  heard  on  20 
meters.  Consistency  of  the  signals 
and  lack  of  Interference  balance  the 
equation. 

A-O-13  is  not  the  only  satellite 
passing  SSTV  signals  in  the  sky. 
RS-12  is  as  well.  Rick  VE4AMU 
and  WA2KUK  have  been  trying 
ROBOT  36-second  color  via  the 
mode  "K*  (15  meters  up  and  10  me- 
ters down)  transponder.  The  big* 


gest  problems  encountered  are  the 
effects  of  Doppler  shift  causing  color 
changes  as  frequencies  shift,  and 
interference  from  15  meter  stations 
not  aware  of  the  satellite  operation. 
SSTV  gear  used  by  bolh  stations 
has  included  the  AEA  AVT  Master 
Amiga  Video  Terminal  with  Com- 
modore Amiga  computers.  Although 
superior  results  might  be  possi- 
ble with  newer  SSTV  modes,  the 
short  passes  have  yielded  more 
pictures  with  the  36-second  ROBOT 
format 

Full-Motion  Video 

Standard  fast-scan  television 
(FSTV)  operation  via  satellite  is  not 
currently  being  considered.  The 
bandwidth  required  exceeds  that 
available  on  most  bands  allocated  for 
amateur  radio  satellite  use.  The 
FSTV  experiments  to  uplink  video  to 
the  Space  Shuttle  require  FCC  per- 
mission for  the  participating  stations 
to  send  6-MHz-wide  signals  to  space. 
The  70  cm  uplink  band  is  normally 
only  3  MHz  wide. 

For  now  SSTV  is  the  best  way  to 
get  images  across  without  using  the 
digital  store-and -forward  satellites.  In 
the  future,  work  on  video-compres- 
sion techniques  will  allow  nearly  full- 
motion  video  via  hamsat  using  spe- 
cial modems  and  digital  data  at  9,600 
to  56.000  bps. 


The  NRF-7 


The  new  NRF-7  is  a  medium  priced  DSP 
product  which  provides  great  flexibility  in 
audio  processing.  Modes  available  include 
atmospheric  (white)  noise  reduction  through 
adaptive  peaking;  spectral  multi-tone  notch 
filtering;  notch  &  peak  combined;  wide  (2400 
Hz)  and  nairow  (1800  Hz)  SSB  filters,  with 
and  without  spectra]  notch;  wide  (500  Hz) 
and  narrow  (250  Hz)  CW  filters  with  se- 
lectable center  frequency;  and  a  500  Hz  wide 


^eM^; 


Pay$& 


DATA  filter  centered  at  2200  Hz.  Since  these 
filters  all  operate  in  real  time,  they  can  be  used  for 
Break-in  CW  or  AMTOR  Note:  noise  reduction 
by  adaptive  filtering  reduces  noise  by  dynami- 
cally reducing  the  bandwidth  and  is  not  effective 
against  impulse-type  noise.  Only  the  NIR-1G 
uses  spectral  subtraction  to  eliminate  impulse 
noises  as  well  as  atmospheric  noise,  while  re- 
taining the  full  audio  bandwidth. 


Only:  $249.95 


The  NIR-10,  the  standard  in  DSP  Noise  Reduction,  still  only  $349.95. 
For  eliminating  carriers  &  other  tones,  the  NF-60.  still  only  SI 49.95.

Baltimore  MD  21208 

Having  been  involved  In  radiotele- 
type  for  many  years,  U+s  easy  to  lose 
sight  of  the  simple  questions  with  com- 
plex answers  posed  by  the  newcomer. 
To  wit  Timothy  S.  Kraus  KC4ZGP,  of 
Warner  Robins,  Georgia,  writes  that 
"Lately,  I've  been  watching  hams  con- 
verse in  60  wpm  Baudot  TTY  I  got  to 
thinking,  I'd  like  to  talk  to  (oiks  out 
there.  Do  you  know  where  I  can  find  a 
surplus  TTY  keyboard?  I  have  the  re- 
ceive side — my  Microdec  MD-1QD — I 
Just  need  a  keyboard.  I  don't  have  a 
computer  and  I  hope  I  won't  have  to 
buy  one  because  RTTY  keyboards  are 
getting  rare." 

Well,  Tim,  there  are  at  least  three 
ways  you  can  go  with  this.  First  off, 
let's  define  a  'RTTY  keyboard/  The 
keyboard  attached  to  classic  teleprint- 
ers such  as  Mode!  15s.  Model  19s, 
and  Model  32s,  is  an  electromechani- 
cal conglomeration  of  levers,  gears, 
and  contacts.  ft  runs  both  off  the  elec- 
trical circuit  built  into  the  machine  and 
via  a  gear  driven  by  the  motor  which 
powers  the  unit,  The  rotation  of  this 
gear  is  critical  both  to  move  the  levers 
and  to  provide  the  timing  needed  for 


Amateur  Radio  Teletype 


the  pulses.  Thus,  an  Isolated  key- 
board, without  a  machine,  is  relatively 
useless. 

Next  up  the  scale  would  be  a  self* 
contained  Baudot  keyboard.  Using  a 
Programmable  Read  Only  Memory 
(PROM)  or  a  diode  matrix  to  encode 
the  five  level  pulses,  such  a  keyboard 
is  a  reasonable  do-it-yourself  project 
Over  the  past  10  years  this  magazine 
has  carried  any  number  of  such  con- 
struction projects.  A  search  of  the  73 
indices  should  turn  up  a  few  that  you 
might  look  at.  Trouble  is,  the  blank 
keyboard  used  in  such  projects  is  be- 
coming a  scarce  animal.  James  Elec- 
tronics, among  others,  used  to  have 
one  that  was  easy  to  use-  Radio  Shack 
used  to,  but  no  longer  does,  to  my 
knowledge.  You  may  be  in  trouble  here 
in  terms  of  obtaining  the  needed  parts. 

The  third  solution  is  the  one  you 
dread,  getting  a  computer  I  Know,  it 
seems  like  overkill  But  a  small  com- 
purer,  such  as  a  used  VIC-20.  C-64r  or 
Radio  Shack  Color  Computer,  should 
be  available  used  for  well  under,  weft 
under,  a  hundred  dollars.  With  suitable 
programming,  any  of  them  would  rjo 
just  fine. 

The  bottom  line  is  to  look  around, 
see  what's  out  there  In  your  area,  and 


go  for  ft.  Whatever  you  do.  why  not 
write  it  up  and  share  it  with  the  readers 
of  this  column,  and  this  magazine?  We 
look  forward  to  hearing  from  you. 

Another  letter  arrived  from  Martha 
Nelson  N3MHD,  in  Milton,  Pennsylva- 
nia. She  tells  us  that  she  has  been 
"playing  for  about  10  months  at  a 
packeteering  computer.  For  fun,  1 
bought  a  128K  Tandy  {color  computer) 
...  I  use  a  Packard  Bell  (and)  KAM  lor 
my  communications.  However,  I  would 
love  to  hear  about  your  experience 
with  the  CoCo/ 

It  really  hurts  me  to  say  this,  but 
you've  bought  an  orphan.  An  orphan  I 
have  loved,  an  orphan  with  great  po- 
tential, a  very  capable  orphan,  but  an 
orphan  nonetheless.  You  seeT  when 
the  first  CoCo  came  out  I  was  right 
there  in  the  store,  plunking  down  my 
cash  almost  before  they  unloaded  the 
truck.  I  had  my  CoCo  2  running  an  SO 
x  24  display,  multiple  disk  drives,  mo- 
dem, and  even  multitasking  under 
QS9,  When  Tandy  Radio  Shack  intro- 
duced the  CoCo  3.  with  more  memory 
and  better  capabilities,  we  thought,  at 
first,  that  this  was  to  be  an  exciting 
new  line.  But  as  they  emphasized  the 
PC-compatible  line  they  first  neglect- 
ed, then  orphaned,  the  CoCo. 

There  are  still  support  groups 
around,  and  there  are  an  awful  lot  of 
these  machines  in  users'  hands,  A 
very  active  SlG  (special  interest  group) 
may  be  found  on  the  Delphi  computer 
network,  There  may  be  files  elsewhere 
as  well;  I  Just  can't  find  them.  Person- 


ally. I  would  use  the  CoCo  as  a  dedi- 
cated terminal  in  front  of  a  multimode 
controller,  or  use  one  Of  the  available 
programs  to  run  it  in  simple  RTTY  or 
packet  mode.  It  Is  usable;  it's  just  go- 
ing to  take  some  work.  I  do  wish  you 
luck,  and  I  look  forward  to  hearing 
about  your  progress. 

Several  of  you  have  asked  for  cir- 
cuits to  power  your  teleprinters.  The 
power  supply  used  supplies  a  constant 
current  in  a  loop,  normally  60  mA  or  20 
mA,  depending  on  the  machine.  At  any 
rale,  Figure  1  is  an  example  of  one 
such  RTTY  loop,  which  uses  transis- 
tors as  current -con  trolling  devices. 
This  is  a  good  pface  to  start,  neither 
too  simple  nor  too  complicated.  Maybe 
next  month  we  will  a  look  at  another 
circuit 

WeVe  kept  things  basic  this  month, 
but  that  is  not  always  the  case,  I  look 
forward  to  hearing  from  you.  each  and 
every  one  of  you.  to  let  me  know  whai

Newcomers  to  amateur  radio  direc- 
tion finding  contests  often  ask  what 
special  transmitters  they  must  obtain 
io  get  in  on  the  fun.  Actually,  the  "fox" 
In  a  foxhunt  or  T-hont,  as  these  events 
are  called,  has  it  easy  from  an  equip- 
ment standpoint.  Most  times,  a  hand- 
ie-talkie or  a  mobile  transceiver  is  all  it 
takes.  With  enough  battery  power  to 
last  through  the  event  and  a  source  of 
audio  (your  voice  or  some  sort  of  tone 
box),  you're  ready  to  set  out  in  search 
of  a  hiding  spot. 

But  the  creativity  of  ambitious 
hiders  sometimes  demands  special 
equipment.  Last  year  in  Albuquerque, 
New  Mexico.  T  hunters  puzzled  for  a 
long  time  before  they  figured  out  that 
the  hidden  T  was  inside  a  cola  can  on 
a  picnic  table.  On  other  hunts,  this  mi- 
cra-T  has  been  hidden  in  a  hole  in  the 
bottom  of  a  fireplace  log,  buried  under 
a  plant,  and  secreted  in  a  cream 
cheese  container  under  a  rock. 

Usefulness  of  a  subminiature  trans- 
mitter is  not  limited  to  competitive  fox- 
hunts. Almost  every  month  I  receive 
requests  for  tiny  radio  beacons  for  un- 
usual purposes,  ranging  from  keeping 
track  of  coon  hounds  to  motorcycle 
theft  deterrence.  Some  of  these  ideas 
are  practical,  others  aren't. 

There  have  been  a  few  articles  In 
hobby  magazines  with  designs  for  fly-

Radio  Direction  Finding 

Where's  My  Glider? 

KB6TTS  is  an  RF  engineer  at  a 
Soothe m  California  aerospace  compa- 
ny, with  10  years  of  experience  work- 
ing with  transmitter  and  receiver  cir- 
cuits, In  his  spare  time,  he  flies  model 
g Eiders  in  the  nearby  deserts.  These  7- 
foot  wingspan  craft  can  travel  up  to 
five  miles  in  a  typical  flight  if  there  are 
good  "thermals"  in  the  air. 

Locating  his  models  when  they  iand 
out  of  visual  range  is  a  frequent  and 
potentially  expensive  problem,  so  In 
the  early  1980s  Ken  started  experi- 
menting with  radio  beacons  for  recov- 
ery. 

In  the  model  glider  world,  every  ad- 
ditional gram  of  weight  and  ounce  of 
drag  Is  undesirable.  Ken's  latest  glider 
beacon  weighs  only  2  grams,  not 
counting  the  antenna  and  battery 
(Photo  A).  That's  about  a  quarter  of  an 
ounce)  With  a  2-gram  3-vott  iithium 
coin  ceil  (#1225),  it  puts  out  a  couple 
of  milliwatts  peak  for  about  48  hours. 
With  a  larger  coin  cell  (#2032).  it  can 
achieve  up  to  3  milliwatts  and  transmit 
for  a  week. 

This  long  battery  life  is  due  in  large 
part  to  the  low  transmit  duty  cycle.  A 
CMOS  timer  keys  the  transmitter  for 
100  milliseconds  each  second,  giving 
short  beeps  in  Ken's  BFO -equipped 
receiver* 

For  more  RF  output  power,  which  is 
usually  desirable  on  T-hunts,  use  a 
standard  9 -volt  alkaline  battery.  This 
gives  25  to  50  milliwatts,  bul  requires 
different  biasing  resistor  values.  The 
alkaline  battery  will  last  a  week  or 
more  in  the  pulsed  mode. 

For  glider  recovery,  the  222  MHz 
(125  centimeter)  ham  band  is  better 
than  2  meters.  High  gain  beams  for 
the  receiver  are  smaller  and  there  is 
less  broadband  noise  from  Santa  Ana 
winds  in  the  desert  to  mask  Ihe  weak 
signal.  Ken's  transmitter  can  be  built 
for  either  band  by  proper  choice  of 
crystal  and  tuned  circuits. 

The  KBGTTS  beacon  board  mea- 
sures only  1,25"  by  0,5".  small  enough 
for  two  to  fit  side  by  side  on  an  Elvis 
stamp.  Figures  1a  and  1b  are  etch 
patterns.  From  and  rear  etch  are  con* 
nected  together  at  hole  locations 
shown  in  Figure  1c.  Figure  2  shows 
the  parts  placement. 

Figure  3  is  Ihe  schematic  of  the  RF 
and  pulsing  circuits.  Component  val- 
ues are  for  2  meters.  For  the  1-1/4 
meter  band,  change  C2  to  47  pF.  C4 
to  22  pF,  and  C6  to  10  pF.  Y1  will  be 
74  to  75  MHz.  For  operation  with  a  9- 
vott  supply,  change  Ri  to  10k,  R2  to 
5.1k.  and  R4  to  22k. 

Ken's  design  is  straightforward  and 
reproducible.  "Very  hot  RF  transistors 
are  needed  for  the  unit  to  work  well  at 
low  voltage  and  provide  plenty  of  en- 
ergy at  the  third  harmonic  of  the  oscil- 
lator,* he  says.  "The  Motorola  MM* 
BR951 L  is  a  good  choice  because  it's

three  options  for  battery  power.  Digs-Key  stocks  the  battery  holders.  Use  quarter- 
wavelength  wires  as  antenna  and  radial. 


inexpensive  and  has,  gain  up  to  6000 
MHz-*  "Q1  forms  a  CotpiftS  oscillator 
with  the  crystal,  C1.  and  02/  he  con- 
tinues-  "The  crystal  sees  the  combined 
capacitance  of  CI  and  C2  as  its  20  pF 
load  and  Itself  looks  inductive  as  these 
elements  form  the  main  frequency 
control  tank.  L2  prevents  the  circuit 
from  oscillating  on  the  fundamental 
frequency  of  the  crystal  and  keeps  it  in 
the  overtone  mode.  The  trick  is  that 
the  oscillator  wilt  work  only  on  fre- 
quencies where  its  emitter  sees  ca- 
pacitance Io  ground.  The  combination 
of  L2  and  C2  must  be  such  that  they 
look  capacitive  at  the  overtone  fre- 
quency but  inductive  at  the  lower  fun- 
damental frequency,  thus  preventing 
oscillation  there/ 

Tank  circuit  L1/C4  is  tuned  to  the 
transmitter  output  frequency,  making 
Q1  an  oselllator/tripler  stage.  Q2  is  a 
buffer  that  amplifies  the  oscillator  out- 
put and  isolates  it  from  load  variations 
at  the  antenna.  U1  pulses  the  Vcc 
supply  to  Qi  and  Q2  with  on  and  off 
time  periods  set  by  R5,  R6,  and  C8. 
Change  these  components  as  you 
wish  to  give  the  right  pulsing  rate  and 
duration  for  your  application.  It  is  im- 
portant to  use  the  CMOS  version  of 
the  555  timer  to  maximize  battery  life, 

The  crystal  is  a  third  overtone  type 
at  2  meters  and  fifth  overtone  at  1-1/4 
meters.  It  should  be  specified  for  20 
pF  load  capacitance,  series  resistance 
not  more  than  60  ohms,  and  frequen- 
cy tolerance  of  25  parts  per  million  or 
better.  Ken  gets  his  from  International 
Crystal  Manufacturing  (ICM)T  Okla- 
homa City,  Oklahoma. 

Pinhead-Size  Parts 


If  your  idea  of  project-building  is 
dropping  component  leads  through 
holes  in  a  nice  big  circuit  board  and 
fastening  them  down  with  a  soldering 
gunT  you  will  need  to  change  your 
ways  for  this  project.  Making  an 
"Agent  007  size*  transmitter  calls  for 
the  same  technology  used  to  make  to- 
day's pocket-size  dual-band  handie- 
talkies.  All  capacitors  and  resistors  are 
chip  components  except  R5,  which  is 
1/fl-watt  carbon.  The  transistors  and 
l C  are  in  surface-mount  packages. 

This  is  definitely  not  a  beginner's 
project.  If  you  have  successfully  built  a 
few  circuit  boards  and  know  your  way 
around  VHF  RF  circuits,  you  should 
be  able  Io  build  and  adjust  this  little 
rig.  Otherwise,  seek  help  from  a  local 
technically-inclined  ham. 

Surface-mount  construction  may 
seem  a  bit  scary,  but  it  just  means  ac- 
quiring a  few  new  skills.  Set  your  sol- 
dering gun  aside  and  use  a  fine-lipped 
iron,  18  to  25  watts.  You  will  also  need 
steady  hands,  a  strong  light,  a  low- 
power  magnifying  lens,  and  a  pair  of 
fine-point  tweezers. 

Once  you  get  the  hang  of  itf  solder- 
ing a  component  onto  the  board  ts  not 
difficult.  Pick  up  the  part  with  tweezers 
and  "wet"  one  terminal  using  the  sol- 
dering Iron  and  a  tiny  amount  of  sol- 
der Use  the  tweezers  to  hold  Ihe  part 
down  on  the  board  in  its  place,  then 
momentarily  touch  the  iron  to  the  p re- 
tinned  pad  to  flow  the  solder  and  se- 
cure the  component.  Then  tack  down 
its  other  Leads,  being  careful  not  to 
overheat  the  part  so  that  it  shifts  posi- 
tion on  the  board.

Figure  3,  Schematic  of  the  tiny  transmitter  as  built  for  146.565  MHz,  the  Southern  California  T*hurtt  frequency.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  capacitances  am  in  pico- 
farads. See  the  text  for  component  changes  for  the  222  MHz  band  and  for  9V  power  supply. 


WHh  a  bit  of  patience,  you  can  sub- 
stitute the  S-meter  of  a  wide-range 
receiver 

As  an  example,  the  output  of  a 
146,565  MHz  unit  should  be  checked 
a!  40.855.  97.710,  195.420.  244,275, 


and  so  forth,  tuning  to  minimize  all 
spurs  and  maximize  the  2  meter  sig- 
nal. Tune-up  is  easiest  with  continu- 
ous output,  so  jumper  the  colJeetor 
and  emitter  of  Q3  during  this  process. 
Whether  you  use  an  analyzer  or  re- 


ceiver, connect  the  mini-T's  output  lo 
the  indicating  Instrument  through  a  re- 
sistive step  attenuator,  so  you  are 
measuring  the  true  output  instead  of 
direct  radiation  from  the  stages. 
Ken's  board  has  no  provisions  for 


ID  or  modulation.  You  wifl  want  to  add 
these  as  appropriate  for  your  applica- 
tion. Many  CW  keying  circuits  have 
been  pubtished,  and  they  can  readily 
be  adapted  to  key  the  Vcc  line  of  this

Various  Gripes 

This  month,  I'd  like  to  address 
various  small  topics  which  keep 
cropping  up,  but  none  of  which  war- 
rants an  entire  column  by  it self . 

Those  Darned  Batteries 

First  of  all*  nickel-cadmium  batter- 
ies. I've  written  a  fair  amount  about 
them,  and  I've  seen  various  contra- 
dictory articles.  Frankly,  I'm  getting 
sick  of  the  whofe  thing.  Some  say 
the  "memory"  effect  exists,  some  say 
it  doesn't,  Some  say  that  discharg- 
ers are  a  bad  idea,  others  like  them. 
My  opinion,  once  and  for  all:  tt  may 
be  memory,  it  may  be  something 
else,  but  whatever  you  want  to  call 
it,  NiCd  packs  don't  work  very  well 
for  very  long.  After  six  months  or  a 
year,  you  almost  inevitably  wind  up 
with  one  or  more  weak  or  shorted 
cells.  Just  tonight  J  had  io  crack 
open  two  $100  laptop  computer 
packs,  each  manufactured  about 
two  years  ago  and  bought  and  used 
only  about  eight  months  ago.  In  both 
of  them,  there  were  a  few  shorted 
cells  alongside  others  which  were 
fulJy  charged.  That  has  happened  to 
just  about  all  the  NiCd  packs  IVe  ev- 
er owned,  and  I  follow  all  the  rules.  I 
suspect  that  the  true  cause  of  the 
failures  is  charge  imbalance. 

What  seems  to  happen  is  this: 
Because  no  two  cells  can  be  abso- 
lutely identical,  some  discharge 
faster  than  others,  especially  when 
sitting  idle  on  the  shelf.  When  the 
pack  appears  to  need  recharging,  it 
really  has  some  Ceils  which  are  only 
partially  discharged.  When  you 
Charge  it  up.  their  higher  resistance 
prevents  the  weaker  ones  from  get- 
ting a  Ml  charge.  Next  cycle,  ft  gets 
even  worse  because  the  weaker 
ones  die  even  faster  due  to  their 
having  only  a  partial  charge  to  begin 
wtth.  Eventually,  the  weaker  ones 
wind  up  getting  reverse -charged  by 
the  stronger  ones  (during  the  dis- 
charge cycle)  and  they  short  out. 
End  of  pack.  I've  had  some  success 
with  zapping  lhemt  but  it  requires 
opening  the  packT  and  rt  doesn't  al- 
ways last. 

tve  never  seen  any  literature  re- 
garding whether  you  should  keep 
your  packs  charged  or  discharged 
between  uses.  In  light  of  the  above, 
rt  might  make  sense  to  reave  them 
discharged.  That  way,  they  can't 
slowly  sink  down  to  uneven  levels 
while  sitting  on  the  shelf;  they're  all 
pretty  low  anyway,  I  can't  verify  the 
wisdom  of  this  approach,  but  it's  a 
strong  hunch.  Perhaps  thafs  why 


they  ship  them  discharged  from  the 
factory. 

As  for  dischargers:  Many  people 
pooh-pooh  them,  but  they  may  be 
wrong.  Did  you  know  that  Sony  is 
now  offering,  for  their  video  equip- 
ment, optional  chargers  which  in- 
clude automatic  dischargers?  Appar- 
ently, even  they  are  admitting  there's 
a  problem  with  NiCds.  I  haven't  tried 
a  discharger,  so  I  can't  say  for  sure 
whether  they  actually  work.  Even  if 
they  can't  fix  a  bad  pack,  at  least 
they  let  you  charge  tip  your  pack 
whenever  you  want  to,  ending  the 
frustration  of  having  only  half  a 
charge  because  you're  afraid  to 
charge  up  a  partially  charged  pack. 

I  don't  want  to  write  about  NiCds 
anymore,  As  I've  said  before,  the 
only  ones  which  have  worked  fairly 
well  for  me  are  those  made  by 
Sanyo.  They  seem  to  hold  a  charge 
much  longer  while  sitting  idle,  and 
that  may  have  something  to  do  with 
It.  Hopeful  ly,  the  new  nickel- metal  - 
hydride  cells  or  some  other  new  kind 
of  battery  technology,  such  as  the 
up-and-coming  rechargeable  lithium 
cells,  will  obsolete  the  old  stuff  once 
and  for  all;  End  of  topic.  Please. 

Open  Wide 

If  youVe  ever  spent  any  time  on 
the  20  meter  band,  you've  heard 
squabbles  arising  over  somebody 
with  excessive  bandwidth.  Just  yes- 
terday I  heard  one  such  argument, 
including  (and  this  Is  a  direct  quote), 
1  don't  think  my  50  watts  could  be 
that  wide,"  Folks,  your  bandwidth 
has  nothing  whatever  to  do  with  how 
much  power  you  are  putting  out.  You 
could  be  running  10X3  milliwatts  and 
still  be  to  kHz  wide! 

We're  all  supposed  to  be  no  more 
than  3  kHz  wide,  unless  we're  run- 
ning AM  or  FM.  On  AM3  we  can  be  6 
kHz  wide,  and  on  FM  even  wider. 
That's  why  FM  is  not  allowed  below 
10  meters.  Ten's  a  big  band,  so 
there  s  room  for  wider  stations  The 
lower  bands  are  just  too  small. 

AM 

There  are  some  people  who  run 
AM  on  20  meters,  tn  fact,  there's  an 
entire  net  of  them,  Personally,  I  find 
the  idea  inconsiderate  but.  hey,  they 
are  allowed  to  do  it,  so  until  the  rules 
change,  we'll  all  have  to  live  wfth  it. 
Luckily,  they  lend  to  stick  to  one  fre- 
quency, so  it  really  isn't  all  that  big  a 
deal. 

The  problem  is  that  most  AM 
transmitters  are  far  wider  than  6 
kHzJ  To  stay  within  that  limit,  the  au- 
dio response  must  go  no  higher  than 
3  kHz,  just  like  on  any  other  mode. 
Compounding  the  circumstance  that 
most  of  these  transmitters  are  very 
old,  and  have  no  filtering  to  prevent 


them  from  being  too  wide,  is  the  fact 
that  many  users  go  out  of  their  way 
to  get  microphones  with  what  they 
call  "broadcast  quality"  sound.  In 
other  words,  lots  of  high  frequency 
response!  Many  AMers  take  a  great 
deal  of  pride  in  sounding  hi-fi  (and 
say  SO  on  the  air),  white  convenient- 
ly ignoring,  and  sometimes  denying, 
the  resulting  bandwidths  of  their  sig- 
nals. Folks,  you  canl  have  the  crisp, 
commercial-quality  highs  without  the 
bandwidth. 

SSB 

But  before  it  sounds  too  much  like 
I  have  rt  in  for  AMers,  which  I  really 
don't,  let  me  say  that  plenty  of 
SSBers  also  are  too  wide.  There  are 
several  reasons,  but  the  most  com- 
mon one  is  the  over-adjustment  of 
speech  processors.  Lots  of  hams, 
and  especially  QXers,  turn  them  up 
to  the  point  of  pain.  Tve  probably 
done  It  myself  a  few  times,  but  It  isn't 
hard  to  avoid.  If  you  have  an  IF 
monitor  button  on  your  rig,  plug  in  a 
pair  of  headphones  and  listen  to 
what  you're  putting  out.  If  it  sounds 
overly  peaky  and  distorted,  back  it 
down  a  little!  tf  you  don't  have  a 
monitor,  have  a  friend  listen  up  and 
down  the  band  to  see  if  you're  within 
proper  bandwidth  limits.  This  works 
best  from  the  range  of  a  few  miies. 
rather  than  from  across  the  country. 
But  even  thai  is  better  than  nothing. 
Above  all,  though,  if  people  com- 
plain that  you're  wide,  don't  get  de- 
fensive. Check  it  out;  they  may  be 
right. 

The  reason  high  power  is  associ- 
ated with  excessive  bandwidth  is 
that  It  Is  really  easy  to  overdrive  a 
linear  amplifier  and  cause  signal- 
widening  distortion.  Using  the  amp's 
ALC  line  can  help  prevent  It,  but  not 
completely.  Some  amps  Just  aren't 
all  that  linear  to  begin  with.  But,  a 
good  clean  amp  wilh  the  right  drive 
will  be  no  wider  than  the  signal  driv- 
ing rt.  And  even  a  QRP  rig  can  have 
excessive  bandwidth  if  you  let  it. 

There's  another  reason  for  SSB 
rigs"  being  too  wide,  and  this  one  is 
no  fault  of  the  operator.  While  rt  is 
true  that  today's  rigs  have  audio  fil- 
ters which  roll  off  above  3  kHz,  they 
don't  have  terribly  steep  skirls.  In 
other  words*  some  of  the  higher  fre- 
quencies do  get  through.  Most  of  the 
filtering  action  occurs  at  the  SSB  fil- 
ter in  the  transmit  IF  stage. 

SSB  rigs  have  two  adjustments, 
one  for  each  sideband,  which  set  the 
frequency  of  the  carrier  before  it  is 
suppressed  in  the  balanced  modula- 
tor. These  frequencies  are  chosen  to 
coincide  with  the  filter  skirts  such 
that  no  opposite  sideband  or  residu- 
al carrier  energy  get  through  the  fil- 
ter. Typically,  the  adjustments  are 
trim  caps  connected  to  crystals  in 
fixed  crystal  oscillators,  in  older  rigs 
which  did  not  have  IF  shift  or  vari- 
able bandwidth  tuning  functions,  ad- 
justing  the  oscillators  caused  the  en- 
lire  rig  to  Shift  In  frequency.  Many 
newer  radios  shift  the  first  local  os- 


cillator to  track  the  carrier  oscillator. 
(And  you  don't  need  digital  synthesis 
io  do  Jt:  heck,  my  old  TS-120  did  it 
with  a  PLL  circuit,  even  though  it  had 
an  analog  VFO.)  Doing  that  has  the 
effect  of  changing  the  passband 
without  detuning  the  radio,  which  is 
exactly  what  you  want  when  you  turn 
your  IF  shift  or  VBT  control.  What 
most  people  don't  realize,  though,  is 
that  it  can  happen  in  transmit  as  well 
as  In  receive. 

Obviously,  the  IF  shift  control  dis- 
appears in  transmit.  But  what  if  the 
oscillator  is  off  to  begin  with?  If  it  is 
set  loo  far  toward  the  Jow  end  of  the 
filter's  response,  the  radio  may  radi- 
ate carrier  or  opposite  sideband.  If  It 
is  set  too  high  in  the  response, 
there'll  be  lots  of  audio  highs  and  the 
RF  signal  will  be  too  wide. 

Over  time,  these  oscillators  drift,  tf 
your  rig  is  on  frequency  but  the 
sound  quality  differs  markedly  be- 
tween USB  and  LSB,  you  may  have 
this  problem.  It  doesn't  take  much 
more  than  50  Hz  drift  to  do  it!  Cor- 
recting it  requires  a  frequency 
counter.  If  you  have  a  sharp  ear.  you 
can  make  it  better  just  by  matching 
the  sounds  of  the  two  sidebands 
while  listening  to  background  static. 
Don't  expect  them  to  be  identical, 
though;  the  two  carriers  are  coming 
at  the  filter  from  opposite  sides  of  its 
passband,  and  no  filter  is  perfectly 
symmelricaL  By  the  way,  the  by-ear 
approach  works  best  when  only  one 
sideband  is  obviously  off,  tf  they're 
both  off,  you  have  no  way  to  know 
where  they  belong. 

There  are  some  people  who  delib- 
erately set  the  carrier  oscillators  to 
make  their  rigs  sound  "punchy"  and 
hot,"  What  they're  doing,  of  course, 
is  reducing  the  bass  and  Increasing 
the  highs.  If  you  do  it,  you  will  annoy 
other  amateurs  and  violate  FCC 
rules  with  your  wide-as-a-bam-door 
signal.  It  Is  far  better  to  have  the  car- 
riers set  properly  and  then  use  a 
punchier  microphone  or  a  little 
speech  processing  to  gel  the  sound 
you  want.  It  is  possible  to  sound 
crisp  and  punchy  within  3  KHz,  Up  to 
a  point,  anyway. 

SSTV 

SSTVers  take  a  lot  of  flack  from 
voice  operators.  Some  lids  go  as  far 
as  causing  deliberate  QRM  to  those 
exchanging  pictures.  Often,  I've 
heard  cracks  about  "all  that  splatter- 
ing noise  interfering  with  us."  In  truth, 
SSTV  tends  to  be  a  bit  narrowrthan 
the  allowed  3  kHz.  The  audio  fre- 
quencies used  to  modulate  the  trans- 
mitter are  carefully  controlled,  and 
they're  sine  waves.  All  in  all,  a  much 
cleaner  signal  than  what  comes  from 
our  vocal  cords.  I  can  tighten  the 
Slope  tuning  on  my  TS-940  to  the 
point  where  voice  signals  are  hard  to 
understand,  without  affecting  SSTV 
reception.  So  how  about  giving  these 
folks  a  little  slack.  OK? 

Well,  l  guess  IVe  griped  enough 
for  one  session.  Next  month,  some- 
thing positive,  I  promise!

Let's  Concentrate  Now 

Carole  Perry  WB2MGP 
Media  Mentors,  inc. 
PO.Box  131646 
Staten  island  NY  W313-0OQ6 

Of  all  tne  skills  that  get  taught  in  a 
classroom,  concentration  and  follow- 
ing directions  are  most  often  over- 
looked.  Perhaps  with  the  rise  of  tech- 
no log  teal  advances  in  information 
storage  and  retrieval  there  is  a  de- 
cline in  emphasis  on  the  basic  mem- 
ory and  concentration  skills.  As  a 
teacher  of  amateur  radio  in  the  class- 
room to  6th,  7th  and  3th  graders.  I 
am  appalled  at  the  lack  of  ability  of 
many  students  to  focus  on  a  task, 
concentrate,  and  to  follow  directions. 
I  am  forever  pointing  out  how  much 
time  we  waste  redoing  work  that  was 
hastily  rushed  through  without 
thought, 

Fortunaiety,  amateur  radio  in  a 
classroom  gives  the  instructor  ample 
opportunity  to  train  youngsters  (and 
adults  as  well)  to  improve  their  audi- 
tory and  concentration  skills.  The 
very  first  time  I  hand  out  code  prac- 


tice oscillators  to  a  class  Js  when  the 
first  lesson  of  "listening"  occurs.  In  an 
average  class  of  40  youngsters,  the 
children  wilt  get  20  keys  to  practice 
on,  using  the  "buddy  system*'  They 
are  literally  forced  to  listen  to  just  Die 
person  sitting  next  to  them,  and  to 
block  out  everyone  else's  tones.  I 
smile  to  myself  as  they  inevitably  get 
very  frustrated  and  try  to  convince 
me  that  it's  impossible  to  hear  only 
their  neighbor  with  so  much  other 
"noise"  going  on  all  around  them.  1 
keep  reassuring  them  that  with  total 
concentration  they  will  definitely  be 
able  to  hear  each  other. 

Of  course,  as  their  auditory  and 
concentration  skills  improve  during 
the  term,  most  of  the  children  be- 
come quite  good  at  being  able  to  dis- 
tinguish particular  tones,  f  remind 
them  periodically  about  how  far 
they've  come.  It's  a  great  motivation 
to  do  better  when  someone  realizes 
that  with  appropriate  effort  they  can 
master  new  skills. 

By  the  end  of  the  term,  almost  ev- 
ery student  has  improved  his  or  her 
ability  to  concentrate  solely  on  their 


neighbor's  messages,  to  the  exclu- 
sion of  Ihe  other  children's  sounds 
and  the  distractions  coming  from  the 
hallway  outside  our  room.  This  exer- 
cise is  just  one  example  of  the  ''hid- 
den1"  benefits  the  children  get  in  a 
ham  radio  class.  It  doesn't  matter 
that  every  student  won't  pass  their 
code  test;  that's  okay.  What  does 
matter  is  that  in  ail  of  my  12  classes, 
every  child  will  have  gotten  more  self 
esteem  by  acquiring  basic  tools  that 
are  needed  to  be  successful  in  ail 
their  studies. 

Following  Directions 

Before  we  get  to  the  part  of  the 
term  where  some  of  the  youngsters 
will  be  filling  out  the  FCC  license  ap- 
plication, we  have  an  entire  lesson 
devoted  to  following  directions  and 
carefully  reading  written  instructions. 
(Another  valuable  lesson!)  Because  I 
always  like  the  more  tedious  lessons 
to  have  a  litlle  "zip"  to  them.  I  make 
my  point  about  the  importance  of  fol- 
lowing directions  and  reading  every- 
thing carefully  through  a  little  fun  ac- 
tivity. I  believe  that  the  lessons  the 
children  learn  through  a  need-to- 
know  situation  or  an  amusing  demon- 
stration will  be  well  learned  and  well 
retained. 

The  following  is  the  "test"  paper 
that  I  have  waiting  on  everyone's 
desk  when  they  enter  the  room.  I 
don't  say  anything  to  them.  On  the

concentration  skills.

Space  restrictions  for  the  March  1993 
"QRP*  column  did  not  allow  me  to  m- 
ckide  the  schematic  tor  the  controller. 
We'll  take  a  look  at  the  entire  project  this 
month. 

Three  of  the  four  chips  used  in  the 
controller  are  LM324  op  amps,  They're 
easy  to  come  by  and  very  inexpensive. 
Each  LM324  consists  of  four  op  amps. 
The  IM324  operates  on  a  single  power 
supply  a  great  advantage  over  the  741 
op  amp.  If  you  buifd  the  circuit  on  pert 
board,  notice  the  unusual  location  of  the 
VCC  pin  (pin  #4}  and  ground  (pin  #11)  of 
this  chip.  Also,  don't  short  the  output  of 
any  of  the  amplifiers  or  you  may  dam- 
age the  chip. 

In  the  March  column  I  described  the 
array  detect  and  power  supply  systems, 
as  well  as  the  stafe-of-charge  reference 
source.  This  time  around,  well  look  at 
the  FET  driver  and  the  driver  switching. 
A  quicK  look  at  the  over- temperature 
comparator  will  wind  up  the  tour. 

From  the  voltage  divider  the  battery 
sense  Is  buffered  by  uiC.  The  output  is 
then  run  to  U1B  where  it  is  compared  to 
the  SOC  reference  voltage.  Two  22  mF 


capacitors  connected  back-to-back 
slowly  charge  and  discharge,  depending 
on  the  input  from  the  battery  sense  line. 
The  output,  on  pin  #8,  will  slowly  rise 
and  fall  along  with  the  battery's  terminal 
voltage.  The  output  of  this  amplifier,  pin 
#6r  is  then  routed  to  two  more  locations, 
First,  it  goes  to  USB.  This  amplifier  and 
U3D  compare  U3B's  output  and  also  act 
as  LEO  drivers.  Op  amp  U3  controls  the 
function  of  the  charging  and  charged 
LEDs, 

The  output  of  U1C  also  goes  to  U2D, 
Op  amp  U20  takes  the  output  from  UIC 
and  the  SOC  reference  voltage  and  will 
generate  a  string  of  pulses  when  the  two 
voltages  are  alike*  If  either  one  of  them 
changes,  the  output  of  U2D  will  also 
change.  This  is  how  the  FETs  are 
switched  on  and  off— by  the  action  of 
U2D. 

The  last  op  amp  before  the  gate  driv- 
er is  U3C  This  op  amp  acts  like  a  switch 
to  provide  a  nice  square  wave  to  the 
voltage  pump.  When  its  output  is  low, 
the  voltage  pump  is  turned  on.  This  then 
turns  on  the  FETs  and  they  conduct, 
passing  current  from  the  array  to  the 
battery  bank. 

The  voltage  pump  is  nearly  identical 
to  the  one  that  l  mentioned  in  the  first 


part  of  this  series.  A 
4001  CMOS  chip  will 
be  used  as  an  oscil- 
lator running  about 
300  kHz.  The  oscilla- 
tor runs  all  the  time 
and  is  never  turned 
oft,  Gates  C  and  D 
act  as  switches  to 
couple  the  oscillator's 
energy  into  the  volt- 
age multiplier  diodes. 
The  output  runs 
about  +22  volts  to  the 
gates  of  the  FETs. 
This  is  a  bit  over  the 
maximum  limit  of  the 
gates  and  therefore  a 
20 -volt  zener  diode 
clamps  the  gate  drive 
at  +20  volts.  This  +20 
volts  turns  on  the 
FETs. 

Although  the  FETs 
have  a  very  low  RDS 
(on),  they  can  still 
generate  heat  when  passing  large 
amounts  of  current.  The  blocking  diode 
will  generate  more  heat  at  higher  cur- 
rents because  of  the  0.3-volt  drop 
across  it.  A  10k  thermrstor  monitors  the 
temperature  of  the  heat  sink.  U2C  is  a 
simpfe  comparator  Cheeking  the  thermis- 
tor's voltage  drop  across  the  other  lOk 
resistor.  When  the  comparator  switches 
stales,  the  output  on  pin  #8  goes  high. 
This  high  is  fed  back  to  the  input  of  the 
chip,  providing  a  set  hysteresis.  This  will

keep  the  over- temperature  shutdown 
from  oscillating  at  the  over-temperature 
point  The  output  also  goes  to  the  LEO 
driver  When  an  over-temperature  condi- 
tion occurs,  the  "charging"  LED  will  be 
forced  off.  Also,  the  SOC  reference  on 
pin  #13  of  U2D  will  be  forced  high,  turn- 
ing off  U2D.  Pin  #8  of  UX  then  be- 
comes high  and  turns  off  the  voltage 
pump.  The  FETs  are  then  turned  off 
during  an  over-temperature  condition. 
Everything  will  stay  this  way  until  the

heat  sink's  temperature  drops  below  the 
reference  voltage  set  by  the  10k  resistor 
and  the  3.3k  resistor  voltage  divider  con- 
nected to  pin  l0ofU2G. 

By  changing  me  value  of  tne  3.3k  re- 
sistor, you  can  alter  the  turn-on  tempera- 
ture. Lowering  the  value  will  raise  the 
over-temperature  shutdown.  Using  a 
welt-calibrated  fingertip  and  a  pot,  I  ad- 
justed the  pot  until  over-temperature 
shutdown  occurred  when  I  thought  the 
heat  sink  got  too  hot  I  then  removed  the 
pott  measured  its  resistance  and  in- 
stalled the  nearest  value-fixed  resistor. 

Because  this  is  a  rather  complex  pro- 
ject using  almost  16  tC  gates,  ifs  best  to 
use  a  PC  board.  FAR  Circuits  (18N64G 
Field  Court.  Dundee  IL  6G118)  has  one 
available  for  S9  plus  SI  .50  shipping  and 
handling,  If  you're  really  up  to  itt  pert 
board  may  also  be  used,  There  are  no 
special  precautions  required  if  it's  built 
on  perl  board.  Photo  A  shows  my  first 
prototype. 

Construe! ion  is  basically  straightfor- 
ward. Sockets  Tor  the  ICs  really  help  in 
troubleshooting  the  project.  If  you're  re- 
ally brave,  solder  everything  in,  Including 
the  ICs,  Watch  for  correct  polarity  of  the 
diodes  and  the  electrolytic  capacitors. 
Remember,  the  two  22  uF  caps  near  U1 
connect  back-lo-back,  The  circuit  will  not 
operate  correctly  if  they  are  placed 
backwards. 

The  MBR1635  blocking  diode  as  well 
as  ihe  FETs  mount  to  a  heat  sink,  in  my 
units,  I  use  a  6*  x  4'  x  1/8"  aluminum 

sheet  to  hold  the  PC  board  as  wen  as 
the  two  active  devices.  Because  both 
have  hot  cases,  -they  must  be  Insulated 
from  the  heat  sink.  Radio  Shack  sells  a 
TO-220  mounting  kit  for  about  a  buck. 
Also  note  that  the  lead  from  the  blocking 
diode  and  the  drain  of  the  FET  are  con- 
nected together.  Carefully  bend  over  Ihe 
leads  of  boih  devices  and  solder  them 
together.  The  leads  are  quite  fragile  and 
are  easily  broken  off  at  the  plastic  body 
ol  the  device. 

The  source  lead  connects  to  the  PC 
board  via  a  #12  gauge  wire.  Another 
length  of  #12  gauge  wire  connects  the 
cathode  of  the  blocking  diode  to  the  ar- 
ray via  the  terminal  block. 

If  you're  going  to  run  over  6  amps 
through  the  controller,  the  PC  board 
trace  between  the  +  battery  terminal  and 
the  source  lead  of  the  FET  should  be 
strengthened.  Again,  a  piece  of  #12 
gauge  wire  soldered  over  the  trace  will 
take  care  of  the  problem. 

Setup  will  require  a  digital  VOM  and 
a  variable  power  supply.  Connect  the 
power  supply  to  the  battery  terminals 
Turn  on  the  supply  and  adjust  it  to  14 
volts.  Using  your  VOM,  check  for  proper 
voltage  of  +12  volts  at  the  7812  regula- 
tor. Check  for  VCC  at  pins  4  of  each 
LM324  and  at  pin  14  on  the  4001.  None 
of  the  LEDs  should  be  on  at  this  time. 

Check  the  voltage  on  pin  7  of  U2A.  It 
should  be  close  to  4  or  5  volts.  By  ad- 
justing the  1k  trimmer,  set  the  output  of 
U2A  to  4.5  volts.  Verify  this  voltage  on 
pins  10  of  LMB.  pin  13  of  U2D.  pin  12  of 
U3D,  pin  10  of  U3C  and  pin  5  of  U3B  If 
you're  missing  one,  then  you  have  a 
wiring  error  or  solder  bridge  on  the  PC 
board. 

Check  the  voltage  on  pin  1  of  U2.  It 

66  73  Amateur  Radio  Today*  May,

should  be  around  4.5  volts.  By  adjusting 
the  470k  trimmer,  you  should  be  able  to 
increase  and  decrease  the  voltage.  Set 
this  point  at  4766  volts.  That's  one-third 
the  battery  voltage  of  14.3  volts,  our 
fully-charged  terminal  voltage. 

Turn  off  the  power  supply  and  re- 
move it  from  the  battery  terminal  on  the 
block,  Reconnect  them  to  the  array  ter- 
minals. Connect  a  small  amp/hour  bat- 
tery (6.5  amp/hour  is  ideal)  to  the  battery 
terminals.  Adjust  the  power  supply  to  16 
to  18  volts  and  turn  it  on.  The  "ARRAY* 
LED  will  come  Oft.  as  will  the  "CHARG- 
ING* LED.  If  you  can  monitor  the  current 
from  your  power  supply,  you  shouid  see 
current  flowing  into  the  battery  at  this 
time.  If  not,  check  for  +20  volts  on  the

gate  of  the  FET.  Also,  double-check  the 
blocking  diode  and  FET  drain  connec- 
tions for  errors, 

As  the  terminal  voEtage  of  the  battery 
hits  14.3  volts,  the  output  of  U3C  will  be- 
gin sending  square  waves  to  the  voltage 
pump.  This  win  rapidly  turn  the  FET  on 
and  off,  controlling  the  How  of  current  in- 
to the  battery.  An  oscrTlDseope  connect- 
ed to  pin  8  of  U3C  will  show  this  clearly. 
The  "CHARGING"  LED  will  now  go  out 
and  the  "CHARGED*  LED  will  come  on. 

During  the  charging  process*  you  can 
try  out  the  over-temperature  shutdown 
by  fiicking  your  BIC  on  the  thermistor. 
The  "CHARGING"  LED  will  go  out  and 
the  "OVER  TEMPH  LED  wflj  come  on.  Alf 
charging  wilt  stop  at  this  time  until  the 


thermistor  cools  down.  When  its  temper- 
ature is  cooled  back  enough,  charging 
wiil  resume. 

By  using  one  FET  and  the  MBR1635, 
you  can  get  up  to  16  amps  of  current 
Mowing,  the  maximum  rating  of  the 
M  BR  1635.  By  using  an  SD51  diode  and 
two  or  more  FETs  in  parallel,  you  can  in- 
crease current  capacily  up  to  45  amps. 
One  BUZ348  FET  and  a  SD51  diode  will 
provide  about  20+  amps  of  currenL  You 
can  add  more  FETs  in  parallei  by  con* 
necling  alf  the  drain  and  source  Jeads  to- 
gether. The  gate  leads  will  require  a 
separate  10k  resistor  for  each  FET 

Next  month  I'll  have  some  trou- 
bleshooting tips  for  the  project  and  some 
modifications  as  well

A  Versatile  NiCd  Charger 

Simple  to  build  with  off-the-shelf  parts. 


by  Ivan  T.  Lorenzen  W4JC 


With  the  ready  availability  of  all  kinds 
of  chargers,  you  may  well  wonder 
why  anybody  would  bother  to  build  one. 
One  good  reason  is  that  by  adding  a  few 
things  (like  a  timer,  a  latching  relay,  a  con- 
stant current  regulator,  and  provision  for 
adjusting  both  the  charging  and  trickle 
rates)  you  will  have  a  truly  versatile  NiCd 
charger  It  will:  (1)  satisfy  a  wide  range  of 
current  requirements;  (2)  automatically 
switch  over  to  a  trickle  rate  at  the  desired 
time;  and  (3)  charge  any  number  of  cells, 
from  one  cell  to  18  cells,  with  any  mAh  rat- 
ing from  100  mAh  to  1500  mAh.  And  it 
won't  go  back  to  charging  again  at  the  end 
of  24  hours. 

There  are  probably  as  many  philosophies 
regarding  the  best  way  to  charge  NiCds  as 
there  are  people  who  use  them.  Some  argue 
that  constant  voltage  is  best,  others  say  con- 
stant current,  and  still  others  argue  the  mer- 
its of  pulsed  DC  over  filtered  steady -state 
DC.  It  has  also  been  argued  that,  in  prac- 
tice, one  will  work  about  as  well  as  another, 
provided  that  limits  are  observed  to  prevent 
damage  to  the  cell(s).  I  have  used  the  con- 
slant  current  method  for  years  and  have 
gotten  excellent  cell  longevity,  The  original 
250  mAh  pack  in  my  early  Tempo  SIT 
handheld  lasted  for  over  12  years  and  faith- 
fully delivered  its  full  capacity  all  thai  time, 
until  it  finally  died  of  old  age. 

The  usual  practice  has  been  to  discharge 
the  pack  until  the  low-battery  indicator 
comes  on.  On  gear  that  has  no  low-battery 
indicator  the  NiCds  are  not  put  on  charge 
until  the  terminal  voltage  is  down  to  L0 
volt  per  cell.  Instead  of  the  commonly  used 
charging  rate  of  10%  of  the  cell's  rated  ca- 
pacity (0.1C),  NiCd  life  can  be  extended  if 
the  charger  is  set  at  0,08C  and  left  on  for  18 
10  20  hours  10  achieve  approximately  150% 
of  the  NiCd  mAh  rating  (L5C).  At  the  end 
of  the  charging  period  the  NiCds  aixr  put  on 
a  trickle  charge  set  at  one-half  the  charging 
rate,  0.04C.  The  NiCds  can  be  left  on  0.Q4C 
trickle  charge  continuously  until  they  are  to 
be  used,  and  they  will  retain  full  charge  un- 
til put  into  service. 

The  circuit  of  this  charger  contains  noth- 
ing new  and  is  quite  simple.  See  Figure  2. 
All  components  arc  standard,  off-the-shelf 
parts.  The  parts  list  includes  Radio  Shack

catalog  numbers  for  some  of  the  parts  that 
may  not  be  readily  available  elsewhere.  The 
1 00  ohm  and  250  ohm  potentiometers  are 
available  from  Digikey  (Telephone:  1-800- 
344-4539).  Wiring  is  point-to-point,  and  the 
parts  placement  is  not  critical,  Any  box  of 
adequate  size  to  hold  the  parts  may  be  used. 
The  timer  is  a  standard  table-top  type  and 
sits  alongside  the  charger.  The  polarized 
AC  female  socket  supplying  AC  to  the 
timer  and  the  mate  polarized  AC  plug 
which  plugs  into  the  socket  on  the  timer  are 
from  an  AC  extension  cord,  and  polarities 
must  be  observed. 

When  SW1  is  closed,  AC  is  applied  to 
the  green  pilot  lamp,  the  timer  clock,  and 
TL  The  relay  is  not  yet  energized,  and  its 
charger  contacts  connect  the  regulator  out- 
put to  the  trickle  adjustment  potentiome- 
ters, so  the  desired  trickle  rate  may  be  set 
immediately  by  adjusting  R5/R6, 

At  this  point,  rotate  the  timer  clock  dial 
until  its  internal  switch  closes,  sending 
AC  to  the  "starf  switch.  Pushing  the 
"start"  switch  lights  the  red  pilot  lamp  and 
energizes  the  relay*  One  set  of  contacts 
holds  the  relay  in  its  energized  position. 
The  other  set  of  contacts  switches  the 
regulator  output  to  the  charge  position,  and 
the  charging  rate  may  be  set  by  adjust- 
ing R2/R3.  Since  the  regulator  is  connected 
as  a  constant  current  device,  any  number  of 
NiCd  cells  from  one  to  18  may  be  con- 


nected to  the  charger  output  terminals. 

When  the  timer  clock  turns  its  internal 
switch  to  "off,"  both  sets  of  relay  contacts 
open,  and  the  NiCds  are  switched  to  trickle 
charge  at  the  rate  previously  set.  The  change 
rate  will  not  come  on  again  unless  the 
"start"  switch  is  pushed. 

This  charger  will  do  what  you  may  now 
be  using  two  or  three  chargers  to  do,  and  it 
will  do  it  better. 

Construction 

All  parts  arc  mounted  on  the  panel.  Re- 
move the  panel  from  the  project  box  or  case 
and  temporarily  position  the  parts  to  assure 
adequate  clearance,  before  holes  are  marked 
and  drilled. 

The  following  parts  are  mounted  on  a  2" 
x  4"  piece  cut  from  unclad  perf  board:  the 
relay  socket,  C2T  C3,  the  bridge  rectifier, 
and  the  LM317T  in  its  heat  sink.  If  a 
mounting  angle  bracket  is  not  available,  you 
can  remove  the  center  lug  from  a  tie-point 
strip  and  bolt  it  to  the  perf  board,  then 
mount  it  on  a  meter  bolt. 

A  tic-point  strip,  with  one  lug  cut  off,  can 
be  mounted  on  the  other  meter-mounting 
bolt  and  used  for  the  junction  of  the  meter- 
shunt  resistors.  A  tie-point  strip  may  also  be 
fastened  to  one  of  the  mounting  bolts  hold- 
ing the  transformer  and  used  for  the  several 
connections  in  the  AC  pan  of  the  wiring. 

The  meter*shunt  resistors  are  standard

sizes  and  will  give  readings  on  the  meler 
within  the  accuracy  of  the  average  multi- 
meter. 

A  round  file  can  be  used  to  make  three 
notches  in  the  back  of  the  plastic  box  for 
the  AC  cords. 

Operating  Notes 

Always  charge  cells  in  series,  not  paral- 
lel, and  be  sure  all  cells  have  the  same  mAh 
rating.  To  put  the  charger  into  charge  mode* 
rotate  the  timer  dial  until  its  internal  switch 
clicks  ONt  then  press  the  "start"  switch. 
The  charge  rate  is  adjustable  from  10  mA  to 
150  mA,  The  trickle  rale  is  adjustable  from 
5  mA  to  75  mA. 


If  even  a  short  power  drop  occurs,  charg- 
ing will  be  slopped.  When  power  returns, 
the  cells  will  automatically  be  put  on  trick- 
le. All  you  need  to  do  is  check  that  the 
trickle  rate  is  set  at  0.05C  (32  mA  for  650 
mAh  ceils),  and  just  leave  the  NiCds  on 
trickle  for  al  least  24  hours  or  until  voltage 
per  cell  reaches  135  to  L4  volts,  measured 
with  the  cell(s)  removed  from  the  changer. 

To  avoid  NiCd  memory  effects,  always 
discharge  NiCds  down  to  I  volt  per  cell  be- 
fore putting  them  on  charge,  and  don't  take 
the  cells  off  charge  until  they  have  received 
a  full  charge. 

If  you  want  to  check  the  trickle  rate  ad- 
justment while  the  charger  is  in  charge 


mode,  turn  the  power  switch  off  momentar- 
ily. The  red  light  will  go  out  Then  turn  the 
power  switch  back  ON  and  adjust  the  trick- 
le rale  as  desired.  Press  the  ''start™  switch  to 
return  to  charge  mode. 

Some  NiCd  battery  packs  have  internal 
protective  circuitry  to  limit  charging  cur- 
rent. In  this  case,  the  charger  cannot  be  ad- 
justed to  force  more  current  than  the  pack 
will  allow. 

Do  not  over-discharge  a  NiCd  battery 
pack  or  you  run  the  risk  of  polarity  reversal 
in  one  or  more  cells.  A  safe  discharge  point 
is  considered  to  be  1  volt  per  cell.  If  your 
equipment  has  a  "Low  Bat"  indicator,  don't 
try  to  get  more  out  of  it.

ATV  Information  Sources 

The  question  I  am  most  often  asked 
is.  'Where  do  I  find  out  more  about 
ATV?".  Fortunately,  there  is  a  variety  of 
publications,  newsletters  and  books  ded- 
icated to  amateur  television.  Another 
good  information  source  is  a  catalog 
from  one  ol  the  ATV  manufacturers  fisted 
here.  Just  browsing  through  one  of  these 
catalogs  should  stir  your  imagination  as 
you  dream  about  your  Ideal  ATV  station. 

ATV  Publications 

There  are  several  publications  that 
cater  specifically  to  the  ATV  crowd  (see 
the  sidebar  for  address'order  info}: 

ATV  Quarterly.  This  magazine  is  dedi- 
cated to  amateur  television.  It  contains  a 
large  variety  of  ATV  construction  pro- 
jects, reviews  of  the  latest  equipment 
and  an  activity  news  section, 

CQ-TV,  This  is  the  journal  of  the 
British  Amateur  Television  Club  and  of* 
fers  a  wide  selection  of  amateur  televi- 
sion projects.  Many  of  the  articles  deal 
with  FM  ATV  or  vitfeo  accessories  and 
are  fascinating  reading. 

The  Spec-Corn  Journal  Originally 
called  AS  Magazine  in  the  early  '30s  and 
before,  this  publication  deals  with  spe- 
cialized modes  (including  ATV).  There 
are  also  sections  about  SSTV,  packet, 
weather  satellites  and  OSCAR  satellites. 

VHF  Communications.  Published  in 
Europe,  this  magazine  offers  a  number 
ol  VHF  and  UHF  projects.  Quite  a  few 
ATV  articles  appear  as  wefl.  It  is  avail- 
able in  English  (see  the  sidebar), 

ATV  Today!  This  is  a  newsletter  that 
offers  some  construction  articles  as  well 
as  a  news  section  showing  some  of  the 
latest  equipment  available. 

ATV  Equipment  Manufacturers 

There  is  a  wide  array  of  companies 


Ham  Television 

that  carry  products  of  particular  interest 
to  the  ATV  community,  I've  included  a  list 
of  a  number  of  these,  along  with  a  de- 
scription of  the  ATV  items  they  carry.  You 
can  now  purchase  a  complete  ATV  sta- 
tion or  buMd  your  own  from  the  kits  and 
accessories  these  manufacturers  carry. 

If  you're  fortunate  enough  to  attend 
this  year's  Dayton  Hamvention,  you  will 
find  a  number  of  these  companies  repre- 
sented, There's  no  better  way  to  decide 
which  route  to  go  than  to  actually  ob- 
serve the  equipment  in  action  at  the 
Hamvention. 

ATV  Nets 

There  are  two  HF  nets  which  meet 
weekly,  if  you  live  in  the  Midwest  or  on 
the  East  Coast,  try  listening  to  3.871 
MHz  every  Tuesday  night  at  9  p.m.  local 
time  (EOT).  On  the  West  Coast,  there  is 
a  net  every  Sunday  morning  at  10  a.m. 
local  time  which  meets  on  7.243  MHz. 
These  nets  are  an  excellent  way  to  meet 
the  area  ATVers,  ask  questions,  set  up 
skeds  and  generally  sfcr  up  activity. 

In  addition,  there  are  a  number  of  lo- 
cal ATV  nets  which  usually  meet  on  the  2 
meter  band.  For  example,  in  Southern 
California  there  are  nets  which  meet  on 
Monday  night  at  7  p.m.  (ML  Wilson 
group)  and  Tuesday  night  at  8  p.m. 
(ATN).  Both  nets  can  be  found  on  146.43 
MHz. 

Calling  Frequencies 

The  2  meter  band  is  usually  used  for 
establishing  contact  for  an  ATV  QSO. 
Some  groups  use  simplex,  others  use 
the  tocaJ  repeater.  There  are,  however,  a 
few  frequencies  that  are  commonly  used 
for  a  specific  region. 

II  you  live  in  Southern  California,  try 
giving  a  cail  on  146,43  MHz;  for  the  Mid- 
west and  portions  of  the  East  Coast,  try 
144.34  MHz  (parts  of  Ohio  use  147.45 
MHz  in  addition  to  144,34). 

f  hope  this  helps  you  to  find  other 
ATV  activity.  It  only  lakes  one  Other 
station  to  get  things  rolling!

Wideband  Test  Amp  and 
Antenna 


This  month  I  thought  you  would  be 
interested  in  a  simple  project  that  can 
have  multiple  uses,  namely  ihe  ability 
to  observe  wide  ranges  of  frequency 
above  1  GHz  with  high  gain  and  a  low 
noise  figure.  Normally,  wideband  de- 
vices Nke  a  receiver  or  a  lest  instal- 
ment such  as  a  spectrum  analyzer 
would  be  used,  but  they  lack  the  prop- 
er  sensitivity.  The  spectrum  analyzer 
that  I  have  is  very  good  but  it  is  20- 
some  years  otd  and  suffers  from  this 
same  problem.  It  does  have  a  large  dy- 
namic range  of  80  to  90  dB,  making  it 
very  useful.  The  problem  is  that  its  age 
and  related  noise  figure  must  be  in  the 
12-10-14  or  greater  dB  range.  A  small 
improvement  here  would  make  a  very 
big  difference  overall. 

The  problem  ts  the  same  with  most 
broadband  receivers.  The  (COM  R- 
7000  ts  an  excellent  one.  It  is  a  super 
monitor  receiver  but  you  have  to  pay 
for  all  its  well-thought-out  options  and 
excellent  sensitivity.  I  would  like  to  own 
one  but  until  that  day  I  will  be  putting 
things  together  (like  this  months  pre- 
lect) to  compensate. 

Try  Surplus 

This  month's  column  assumes  that 
you  have  some  sort  of  broadband  re- 
ceiver or  test  set  that  is  in  need  of  a 
high  gain,  low  noise  preamplifier  Addi- 
tionally, with  this  preamp  an  antenna  is 
needed  to  cover  the  very  large  fre- 
quency band  of  operation  to  form  the 
final  part  of  the  system.  Let's  start  our 


UHF  And  Above  Operation 


construction  of  a  suitable  amplifier  by 
hunting  in  the  surplus  market  to  see  it 
we  need  to  construct  from  scratch  or  if 
we  can  put  to  use  something  that  has 
already  been  built. 

BuiJding  from  scratch  usually  poses 
problems  in  acquiring  component 
parts,  tn  mis  case,  there  is  a  simple 
solution:  Look  in  the  surplus  market 
for  something  that  exists  in  quantity. 
This  project,  the  preamp,  is  construct- 
ed out  of  a  surplus  satellite  LNA  (low 
noise  amplifier).  Normally,  this  amp  is 
built  for  operation  in  the  3.7  GHz  to  4.2 
GHz  range,  with  30  1o  40  dB  gain  and 
a  low  noise  figure  (something  near  1  to 
2  dB)  for  most  surplus  units  I  have 
observed. 

Surplus  availability  is  Quite  good — 
most  people  are  upgrading  their  exist- 
ing systems  to  tower  noise  figure  am- 
plifiers and  smaller  dishes.  This  rele- 
gates the  older  (higher  noise  figure) 
amps  into  the  surplus  market.  The 
price  on  the  surplus  swap  meet  market 
is  around  $5  as  is.  $10  for  stated 
"good"  units.  Of  ttie  several  LNA  ampli- 
fiers of  various  designs  that  have 
passed  through  my  hands,  only  one 
had  a  blown  front  end  stage.  All  the 
Other  LNA  amplifiers  worked.  The  de- 
fective one  showed  signs  of  corrosion 
and  water  leakage  into  the  inside  of  the 
case.  Let's  hope  you  have  the  same 
luck  with  the  LNAs  that  you  find. 

The  application  I  have  in  mind  for 
the  LNA  is  not  just  to  monitor  the  3.7  to 
4+2  GHz  band.  Wrth  a  small  modlfica* 
lion,  Kerry  N6IZW  was  able  to  increase 
the  frequency  range  of  the  amplifier  to 
cover  from  800  MHz  to  about  4.2  GHz, 
with  associated  gain  in  the  20  to  30  dB 
area  over  bandwidth.  There  were  gain 
peaks  and  dips,  but  for  the  most  part 
the  gain  curves  looked  good.

The  modification  is  somewhat  deli* 
cate.  but  if  you're  careful  it  can  be  done 
easily.  First,  open  up  the  LNA  by  re- 
moving the  small  screws  which  hold 
the  amplifier  cover  onto  the  main  alu- 
minum cast  body,  Remove  the  cover 
and  the  PC  board  for  the  amplifier. 
Now  the  associated  circuitry  should  be 
exposed.  Looking  at  the  amplifier  RF 
circuits  you  can  see  several  stubs  on 
the  input  and  output  of  each  stage  in 
the  LNA.  These  stubs  are  used  in  the 
original  design  to  peak  up  each  stage 
tor  the  best  gain  and  noise  figure  in  the 
frequency  band  of  interest,  namely  3.7 
to  4.2  GHz.  Using  an  X-acto  knife,  gen- 
tly cut/disconnect  these  tuning  lines 
(they  are  the  thick  lines)  from  the  main 
transmission  line  that  runs  straight  from 
the  input  to  the  output  of  each  device- 
See  Figure  1  for  details. 

Disconnect  all  such  lines,  being 
careful  not  to  disconnect  the  narrow 
HFC  lines  which  supply  DC  power  and 
bias  to  the  FET  devices.  Also,  be  care- 
ful to  ground  the  work  station  to  pre- 
vent static  buildup  from  damaging  l he 
devices  in  Ihe  amplifier.  When  workjng 
with  the  X«acto  knife,  use  a  sharp 
blade  and  don!  press  hard  on  the  soft 
Teflon  PC  board  while  disconnecting 
the  tuning  lines.  Teflon  is  quite  soft  and 
you  will  go  right  through  the  board  ma- 
terial if  you're  not  careful.  Use  light 
pressure  to  cut  away  part  of  the  con- 
nection to  DC-isolate  them.  You  don't 
have  to  remove  the  entire  line,  just  dis- 
connect it  from  the  main  line- 
Removing  these  tuning  stubs  alters 
the  frequency  response  of  the  amplifier 
gain  curve.  It  will  not  be  peaked  up  at 
its  normal  range  but  will  now  give  a 
much  broader  and  lower  frequency 
range  of  operation.  In  the  unit  that  Ker 
ry  modified,  the  device  gave  usable  op- 
eration from  800  MHz  to  over  4  GHz. 

Once  that  part  of  the  operation  is 
complete,  the  input  circuit  can  be 
changed  as  we  will  not  be  using  a 
waveguide  for  this  amplifier  anymore. 
The  Input  probe  in  the  waveguide  cavi- 
ty must  be  removed,  and  an  isolation 
capacitor  needs  to  be  added  to  the  cir- 
cuit first.  Locate  the  place  where  this 
probe  is  connected  on  the  main  PC 
board  trace  and  cut  this  trace  again 


with  the  X-acto  knife.  On  this  spot  we 
are  going  to  pface  a  1 0  pF  (or  so)  val- 
ue coupling  capacitor  to  give  DC  isola- 
tion to  the  input  of  the  amp.  tn  the 
unit's  original  condition  this  was  not 
necessary  because  the  probe  was  iso- 
lated in  the  waveguide.  We  will  remove 
the  waveguide  and  replace  it  with  an 
SMA  connector,  which  requires  DC  iso- 
lation* After  the  board  lias  been  cut  to 
accept  the  capacitor  {a  chip  type),  stop 
this  part  of  the  procedure  and  unsolder 
the  probe  from  the  PC  board,  which  is 
now  isolated  by  the  cut  in  the  PC 
board.  Remove  the  probe  from  the  PC 
board  connection. 

Mow,  with  a  handsaw  remove  the 
waveguide  flange,  cutting  it  flush  with 
the  top  of  the  amplifier  body.  Put  a 
piece  of  masking  tape  on  the  open  side 
of  the  amplifier  to  keep  metal  filings 
from  contaminating  the  PC  board  area 
when  the  waveguide  flange  is  re- 
moved. Vou  will  also  be  able  to  remove 
the  Teflon  Insulator  that  insulated  the 
old  RF  waveguide  probe.  It  should  just 
pop  out  with  a  little  pressure.  Clean  the 
PC  board  hole  where  the  removed 
probe  was  soldered  and  In  its  place  put 
an  SMA  coaxial  connector 

The  Teflon  insulator  on  the  connec- 
tor might  need  a  little  trimming,  but 
some  are  exactly  the  right  size  to  slip 
in  the  hole  where  the  old  Teflon  insula- 
tor used  to  be.  The  center  connector  of 
the  SMA  connector  should  be  long 
enough  to  fit  right  in  the  PC  board  hole 
you  just  cleaned. 

Mark  ihe  SMA  connector  mounting 
holes  and  drill  and  tap  for  a  couple  of 
mounting  screws  to  hold  the  SMA  con- 
nector body  securely  to  ground  Now, 
on  the  PC  board  remove  the  paper 
tape  from  the  PC  board  cover  plate 
area  and  mount  the  new  coupling  ca- 
pacitor to  the  SMA  connector  tip  and  to 
the  other  side  of  the  center  line  you  cut 
before.  This  will  give  you  DC  isolation 
to  the  coax  connector. 

At  this  point,  check  the  unit  tor  er- 
rors. When  you  are  ready,  reapply  DC 
power,  If  you  used  standard  static  pro- 
tection everything  should  be  OK,  Even 
so.  amplifiers  in  circuits  are  less  sus- 
ceptible to  static  than  loose  compo- 
nents. If  you  used  proper  care  in  mak- 
ing the  modification,  everything  should

bo  OK.  Remember  that  different  units

Constructing  an  Appropriate 
Antenna 

Due  to  the  broad  bandwidth  of  the 
modified  amplifier*  we  needed  to  con- 
struct a  new  antenna  for  bench  or  even 
outside  applications.  The  normal  an- 
tennas we  had  did  not  cover  such  a 
wide  range  of  frequencies,  Our  station 
monitor  antenna,  which  works  from  SO 
MHz  to  over  1200  MHz,  worked  well 
but  something  was  needed  for  the  up- 
per frequency  ranges.  We  decided  Jo 
construct  a  simple  small-scale  version 
of  our  low  frequency  monitor  antenna, 
a  discone  for  the  1  GHz  to  4  GHz 
range.  This  antenna  worked  quite  well 
ovef  ouf  frequency  range  and  it  is  easy 
to  duplicate, 

A  miniature  replacement  of  the  low 
frequency  discone  turned  out  to  be  on- 
ly 3-1/2"  high  and  less  than  3"  wide  at 
the  base  and  top  hat  of  the  antenna. 
This  antenna  is  basically  a  funnel 
turned  upside-down,  with  the  bottom 
spout  of  the  funnel  removed.  At  this 
point  a  top  hat  or  disc  is  elect  neatly 
connected  to  the  center  of  the  coax  ca- 
ble. In  our  case  we  used  0.141  o.d,  50 
ohm  hardline,  quite  common  tn  mi- 
crowave circuits. 

The  bottom  part  of  the  funnel,  or  ice 
cream  cone,  has  the  coax  cable  pro- 
truding just  3/32*  above  the  small  end 
of  the  cone  (ground  portion  of  the 
coax),  The  portion  of  the  3/32*  is  all  in- 
sulator, separating  the  funnel  cone 
from  the  top  hat.  The  center  conductor 
is  about  1/4"  longer,  sticking  up  above 
this  3/32*  of  insulation.  Mount  the  top

hat  horizontally  to  this  center  conduc- 
tor, to  the  top  of  the  cone,  and  solder  it 
directly  to  the  center  of  the  coax  cable. 
The  3/32'  space  of  insulation  serves 
as  an  isolator  between  the  fop  ring  and 
the  bottom  cone.  See  Figure  2  tor  in- 
formation on  the  discone  dimensions. 

Please  note  that  the  dimensions  of 
the  discone  antenna  are  not  too  critical 
and  there  is  room  for  error.  Our  anten- 
na was  cut  out  of  flashing  copper  about 
0020*  thick,  and  it  bends  (forms)  quite 
easily.  It  also  solders  with  small- 
wattage  irons.  Most  of  the  0,141  solid 
sheath  coax  comes  with  Teflon  insula- 
tion, making  it  somewhat  impervious  to 
heat  during  construction. 

In  actual  use,  the  antenna  and  am- 
plifier functioned  well,  although  no  ac- 
tual measurements  were  made  on  an- 
tenna parameters,  The  antenna  and 
amp  have  been  used  in  spectrum  ana- 
lyzer applications  to  observe  low* level 
products  from  workbench  construction 
projects.  They  can  even  detect  some

of  the  microwave  ovens  in  the  neigh- 
borhood. Their  operation  is  on  the  low 
2.2  GHz  part  of  the  spectrum.  In  any 
case,  this  conversion  should  give  you 
increased  sensitivity  over  quite  a  range 
of  frequency,  with  lots  of  gain  and  a 
great  noise  figure,  for  a  little  effort  and 
few  dollars . 

Be  sure  to  keep  a  good  stock  of  X- 
acto  knives  and  blades  available  for 
conversions  on  lots  of  surplus  items. 
After  all,  who  said  you  can't  make  a 
silk  purse  out  of  a  sow+s  ear?

The  Tin  Can  fitters  for  2  meters  in 
the  November  and  December  1992 
editions  of  this  column  caught  Dick 
NSJSY's  eye.  He  is  quite  involved  with 
the  CAR,E.S  (Coastal  Amateur  Radio 
Emergency  Services}  group.  They  use 
2  meters  for  primary  communication 
and  have  found  thai  when  two  nets 
were  being  run  on  2  meters  there  were 
desense  communication  problems.

Their  problem  is  related  to  the  opera- 
tk>n  of  many  different  types  of  2  meter 
HTs,  ail  operating  in  close  proximity  to 
each  other  on  different  frequencies, 
causing  desense  to  each  other. 

Since  most  of  today's  newer  radios 
are  quite  compact  and  capable  of  oper- 
ation on  wide  bands  of  frequency,  this 
type  of  problem  is  common.  Some 
form  o<  frequency  limiting  is  necessary 
to  prevent  the  excellent  front  ends  from 
being  overloaded  or  saturated  from 
nearby  RF.  Qutte  a  few  OF  my  HTs  suf- 
fer In  varying  degrees  from  this  prob- 
lem, even  from  commercial  radio  and 
TV  frequencies  when  their  transmitters 
are  nearby.  The  problem  is  due  to  the 
wideband  "hypersensitive"  front  ends 
that  are  not  tuned  to  a  specific  frequen- 
cy. In  this  case  a  filter  would  help  solve 
the  problem. 

The  cavity  or  "soup  can"  cavity  can 
be  placed  on  your  antenna  tead  to  pro- 
vide the  required  isolation  from  other 
frequencies.  The  narrow  passband  of 
the  cavity  will  provide  attenuation  to 
the  other  frequencies,  providing  the  ex- 
tra margin  for  operation.  We  found  that 
the  bandwidth  of  the  Tin  Can  fiiter  was 
quite  narrow,  somewhere  in  the  100  to 
200  kHz  range  on  2  meters  (for  typical 
Tin  Can  cavities).  This  is  dependent  on 
the  can  size,  construction  details  and 
coupling  link  placement.  All  this  can  be 
"Jiggled"  or  adjusted  to  allow  custom 
design  after  your  first-Cut  design  at- 
tempt. There  are  so  many  factors  in- 
volved, however,  that  most  work  out 
well  with  some  re-positioning  or  differ* 
ent  can  selection.  You  just  have  to  try 
for  yourself — ail  you  have  to  lose  is  a 
little  time  and  very  few  materials. 

With  small  ceramic  variable  capaci- 
tors suitable  for  low  power  HTs.  run- 
ning 5  watts  would  be  OK.  As  always, 
try  out  this  type  of  filter  with  even  lower 
power  {100  mW  on  some  HTs)  when 
testing  so  you  don't  damage  the  HT 
you  are  using.  If  pre-tests  can  be  done 
with  something  other  than  a  rig,  so 
much  the  better.  I  happen  to  be 
blessed  with  a  well-stocked  work- 
bench, allowing  most  types  of  mea- 
surements to  be  made  with  test  instru- 
mentation, tt  proves  to  be  very  valu- 
able to  see  what  exactfy  is  going  on. 
However,  lots  of  small  projects  can  be 
constructed  with  a  little  care  and  no 
special  test  equipment  other  than  an 
SWR  meter. 

The  Tin  Can  filter  is  just  a  compact 


cavity-High  XT  filler  that  can  be  cheap- 
ly constructed,  It's  sort  of  a  poor  man's 
cavity,  and  ft  should  no*  cost  more  than 
a  couple  of  bucks  to  construct.  All  that 
is  needed  is  two  BNC  connectors,  a  tin 
can.  a  small  ceramic  10  pF  capacitor, 
and  a  short  section  of  3/B*  to  1/4'  hob- 
by brass  tube  for  the  center  element. 
Don't  worry  about  the  input/output  links 
being  a  direct  short;  they  are  at  DC  but 
at  145  MHz  they  represent  something 
in  the  order  of  50  ohms  reactance.  At 
RF  this  Is  not  a  short! 

A  variation  of  the  cavity  is  !he  mutti- 
tuned  circuit  I  covered  earlier.  There 
has  been  some  discussion  as  to  cou- 
pling loss  for  different  construction 
types.  In  the  case  of  high  loss,  the 
problem  Hes  in  poor  circuit-to-circuit 
coupffng  between  coifs.  One  cure  is  to 
place  a  coupling  link  in  place  from 
one  circuit  to  the  other.  This  is  nothing 
more  than  a  short  piece  of  targe  diam- 
eter insulated  wire  soldered  to  the 
variable  capacitor  on  one  circuit  and 
bent  near  the  other  circuit.  Try  several 
places  for  positioning;  test  to  improve 
coupling  loss.  Its  a  cut-arid-try  propo- 
sition at  best  but  will  make  a  dif- 
ference. 

As  always.  I  wilt  answer  questions 
on  this  and  related  projects.  For  a 
prompt  reply  pfease  send  an  S.A.S.E. 

10  GHz  EME  Activity 

On  January  31,  1993,  at  22:30, 
G3WDG  and  G4KGC  made  Iwo  EME 


QSOs  on  10  GHz.  This  is  believed  to 
be  the  first  made  on  this  band  from  the 
UK.  The  intial  QSO  was  with  WA7CJO 
in  Phoenix,  Arizona,  at  22:30.  This  was 
the  second  attempt.  The  first  test  on 
January  30  was  partially  successful  as 
WA7CJO  was  heard  at  good  signal 
strength  but  they  could  not  find 
G3WDG's  signal.  This  difficulty  was 
caused  by  a  problem  in  a  preamp  at 
WAZCJas  location. 

The  antenna  in  use  in  the  UK  was  a 
10-foot  solid  dish  (Andrew  11  GHz  ver- 
sion) mounted  on  an  EL/A2  mount 
originally  intended  for  satellite  TV  use 
but  modified  for  a  motor  drive.  The  dish 
was  scraped  off  from  a  local  electron- 
ics company  where  G3WDG  used  to 
work.  The  rest  of  the  equipment  con- 
sisted of  a  Hughes  28  watt  TWT  ampli- 
fier.  Many  thanks  to  WA5VJB  and 
KY7B  for  their  help  in  acquiring  this 
tube  and  refurbishing  the  power  sup- 

This  is  typical  of  some  of  the  con- 
tacts that,  with  dedication  and  plan- 
ning, can  be  made,  I  will  have  more 
detailed  information  about  this  contact 
and  others  in  my  next  column.  Con- 
gratulations for  a  great  job  done.

intelligence.  (Personal  note  to  Mike 
Galego  KA4MUJ:  The  word  frequency  is 
pronounced  "free- kwen -seer  not  °free- 
ken-see.*  There's  a  V  sound  in  there.) 

Other  than  giving  yours  truly  the 
chance  to  poke  fun  at  these  misfits, 
what  does  all  of  this  mean?  It  means 
(hat  the  FCC  is  finally  doing  what  the 
amateur  radio  community  has  been  ask- 
ing them  to  do  for  years:  Clean  up  the 
mess  on  our  bands.  The  rest  of  us  are 
sick  and  tired  of  having  our  frequencies 
overrun  by  vermin.  We  do  not  care 
which  side  of  the  issue  they  are  on.  We 
want  the  outlaws  rounded  up.  In  fact,  it 
doesn't  have  to  take  that 
long  or  cost  that  much 
money,  if  the  FCC  made  a 
concerted  effort,  dedicating 
their  monitoring  stations  to 
policing  the  ham  bands  for 
four  random  weeks  out  of 
the  year.  I  bet  our  bands 
would  be  a  lot  less  messy 
and  the  FCC  would  collect 
a  lot  more  money.  Once 
they  round  up  all  the  ne'r- 
do- wells  on  20  meters,  they 
could  spend  a  few  nights 
monitoring  80  meters. 

The  other  thing  that 
needs  to  happen  is  we 
must  come  up  with  a  way 
that  repeat  offenders  like 
Dick  Whiten  can  have  their 
licenses  yanked  lor  good.  It 
would  be  very  easy  to  write 
something  into  Part  97  like 
"the  FCC  shall  have  the  au- 


thority to  revoke  the  license  of  any  ama- 
teur radio  operator  upon  receipt  of  that 
amateur  radio  operator's  third  Notice  Of 
Apparent  Liability,  and  that  person  shall 
no  longer  be  eligible  to  receive  an  ama- 
teur radio  license,*  This  isn't  exactly 
strict  Tegalese,"  but  you  all  get  the  point. 
An  amateur  radio  license  is  a  privilege, 
not  a  right,  and  those  who  abuse  the 
privilege  should  be  banned  for  life.  If  you 
don't  play  by  the  rules,  you  can't  play. 
Period.  End  of  Story.  Maybe  I  ought  lo 
seriousfy  consider  writing  up  a  rule  like 
this  and  asking  the  FCC  to  consider  it, 
ail  format  and  legal-like.  What  do  you 
think?  Would  you  support  something 
like  this?  If  I  hear  from  enough  of  you, 
I'll  do  iL

Notes  from  FN42 

When  it  rains,  it  pours!  There  was 
much  news  in  the  mail  for  this  month! 
Some  of  it  wilt  have  to  wait  til  next 
month. 

It's  a  smalt  wurtd*  again!  I  went  to 
Boston  to  have  lunch  with  one  of  my 
sons  fast  week,  and  he  introduced  me 
to  a  young  lady  who  was  moving  into 
the  budding  he  fives  in.  She  was  being 
helped  by  two  Chinese  men  and  one 
woman.  He  totd  me  later  that  she  was 
from  Beijing,  China r  $0  of  course  I 
asked  her  if  she  knew  anything  about 
Tsinghau  University.  She  said  ~no*  but 
the  other  girt  she  had  introduced  m&  to 
earlier  had  graduated  with  a  chemical 
engineering  degree  from  there,  I  wish  I 
had  known  that  earlier  so  than  could 
have  found  out  it  she  knows  Rick 
Hunter,  our  Hambassador  for  China, 
who  is  a  student  mere. 

One  last  thing  before  alt  the  news. 
It's  that  time  of  year  again:  the  semi- 
annual pilgrimage  to  HQSS-

Hello  Clover  users.  I  have  just  re* 
ceived  a  message  from  Fred  DK4ZC 
saying  that  many  EU  hams  would  like 
to  QSO  in  Clover  with  USA  hams  in 
order  to  test  their  setups  and  just  to 
have  somebody  to  talk  to  in  this  new 
mode.  According  to  Fred*  most  of 
them  operate  and  monitor  21.083,

beautiful,  safe,  and  peaceful  place.  Tht 
cost  of  a  Montserrat  vacation  is  compa- 
rable to  a  Florida  resort  stay:  Trave 
costs  are  a  bit  higher,  but  Jiving  expens-

reasonable  on  the  island.  Our  total  ex-

French  e%,  near  the  Spanish  border, 
the  streets  were  noticeably  brighter 
during  the  pass,  as  seen  by  several 
town  people. 

Shortly  after  it  crossed  the 
day/night  terminator  in  Europe,  the  so- 
lar salt  was  released  from  the 
Progress.  The  sail  then  lost  altitude 
until  it  re-entered  the  atmosphere  on 
the  7th. 

Certainly  this  ranks  as  one  of  ihe 
more  noticed  Russian/CIS  space  ex- 
periments in  recent  years.  (Glenn 
Chapman.  Simon  Fraser  U.t

Letter  from  Dmitri  A  Scuitov:  Alter 
having  gotten  familiar  with  the  Novem- 
ber '91  issue  of  73  (occasionally  re- 
ceived from  my  American  :>en  pa!) 
there  appears  to  be  a  strong  leeling  of 
nostalgia  for  my  former  trv  uary  spe- 
ciality as  I  read  about  more  and  more 
things  and  problems  familiar  to  me.  I 
was  a  radio  operator  during  my  two* 
year  military  service,  wording  as  a  CW 
communications  operator  and  receiv- 
ing high-speed  air  notification  informa- 
tion (also  in  the  CW  mode).  However, 
after  being  demobilized  in  1938.  I 
didn't  have  any  opportunity  to  become 
a  licenced  civil  amateur,  first  of  all  be- 
cause  of  having  no  chance  to  get 
proper  gear  In  my  country.  So,  I  still 
remain  a  SW  DXer,  my  main  interest 
being  broadcast  stations,  but  not  giv- 
ing up  hope  to  start  again  that  fasci- 
nating hobby  of  radio  communication. 

At  present  I  am  in  contact  with  sev- 
eral US  amateurs  who  are  also  inter- 
ested In  the  DXing  ot  broadcast  sta- 
tions, and  who  know  about  the  prob- 
lem of  DXtng  the  stations  in  CIS 
broadcasting  in  the  Russian  language. 
Many  stations  don't  send  QSLs  if  the 
report  is  written  in  a  language  other 
than  Russian.  SoN  I'd  like  to  offer  a  so- 
lution to  this  problem. 

If  any  of  the  73  readers  would  like 
to  sent  their  reception  report  to  a  sta- 
tion on  the  territory  of  the  former  Sovi- 
et Union,  broadcasting  in  Russian,  but 
don't  know  I  he  language,  then  send 
your  report  in  English  to  me.  I'll  make 
a  qualified  translation  and  forward  it  to 
the  station  you  need  in  Ihe  CIS,  US$2 
or  4  IRCs  fee.  please  For  an  addition- 
al US$2  fee  I  could  keep  correspon- 
dence with  ihe  station  by  myself  and 
then  send  you  the  reply  translated  into 
English,  This  price  just  covers  leasing 
computer  time  to  compite  the  reports, 
and  the  greatly  increased  postal  tariffs 
in  Russia. 

Please  send  your  requests  to  Dmitri

United  Kingdom  Downloaded  from 
amsat.org:  UK  Novices  on  OSCAR 
TWs  week's  GB2RS  News  Bulletin  re- 
ports that  the  70  cm  frequency  alloca- 
tion for  UK  Novice  licensees  has  just 
been  expanded  to  432.Q-440.Q  MHz, 
i.e.,  it  will  now  include  the  satellite 
subband  for  the  first  time.  UK  Novices 
will  thus  be  able  to  access  any  satel- 
lite with  a  70  cm  uplink,  including  AO 
10andAO-13, 

Of  course,  the  Novice  power  limit  of 
3  watts  output  will  pose  a  challenge, 
but  one  that  can  be  overcome.  With 
3W  output,  forward  gain  of  17  dBi  (typ- 
ical of  a  40  -element  cross-yagi — 20  el- 
ements each  way)  will  produce  up  to 
150W  eirp.  more  than  enough  to  ac- 
cess AO-10  or  ACM  3  if  conditions  are 
good. 

UK  Novices  have  caltsigns  with  2"Q 
and  2*1  prefixes  and  three-letter  suf- 
fixes, where -  is  a  geographical  indica- 
tor (E  _  England,  M  =  Scotland,  W  = 
Wales,  I  =  Northern  Ireland,  D  =  Isle  of 
Man,  etc).  For  example,  2E0AAA 
would  be  a  Novice  in  England,  while 
2D1AAB  would  be  located  on  the  Isle 
of  Man.  A  ll0"  in  the  callsign  Indicates 
that  the  holder  has  passed  a  code  test 
and  enjoys  limited  HF  privileges;  "1'  is 
no-code. 

Who  will  be  the  first  UK  Novice  to 
make  an  OSCAR  QSO,  and  who'll  be 
the  first  to  work  one?  Sorry,  2E  won't 
count  as  a  new  country.  73,  Ray  Sorter

USA/Guatemala  Request  from 
Paul  Neuger  WUtB  via  packet:  My 
daughter  Lisa  N1IAR  is  considering 
going  to  Quetzartenango,  Guatemala, 
to  attend  the  Casa  de  Espanol  Xelaju 
Spanish  School.  I  know  nothing  about 
Guatemala,  the  school,  or  how  to  get 
a  license  lor  Guatemala,  I  would  cer- 
tainly appreciate  any  information  you 
can  pass  one  to  me.  Address:  Paul 


However,  complete  details  were  not 
provided,  and  the  changes  need  to  be 
cross-checked  against  the  existing 
Radiocommunications  Act  for  consis- 
tency; add  to  that  a  forthcoming  Fed- 
eral election,  and  It  will  apparently  be 
some  time  before  the  actual  slructure 
is  known.  When  details  are  available  I 
will  report  them. 

In  the  meantime,  the  highlights  are: 


a  no-code  Limited  Novice  licence  al- 
lowing voice  and  packet  radio  on  2m 
and  7D  cm:  "Limited"  licences  (no  HF 
privileges)  may  use  FM  (voice)  on  the 
10m  band  to  encourage  its  use  (and 
presumably  to  keep  the  pirates  out  of 
it);  amateurs  holding  both  Novice  and 
Limited  certificates  will  come  under  an 
Intermediate  category  of  licence; 
Novices  will  be  permitted  higher  power 
outputs,  to  be  consistent  with  commer- 
cially available  equipment;  and  various 
restrictive  rules  applying  to  both  voice 
repeaters  and  packet  radio  will  be  re- 
laxed, permitting  greater  freedom  for 
experimentation,  etc. 

All  in  all,  it  appears  that  these 
changes  will  encourage  many  more 
people,  especially  computer  "whizz- 
kids"  to  lake  up  amateur  radio.  I  ac- 
knowledge the  Wireless  Institute  of 
Australia  (WIA)  as  the  source  of  this 
information. 

The  WIA  has  had  charge  of  the  am- 
ateur examinations  for  over  a  year  now, 
with  a  team  of  more  than  400  registered 
examiners,  It  does  not  appear  to  be  the 
tiebacte  that  its  opponents  had  predict- 
ed, but  as  usual,  there  are  some  bad 
apples.  It  appears  that  four  examiner 
teams  are  under  investigation  by  the 
DoTC  for  apparent  irregularities  in  the 
conduct  of  examinations.  Cheers  for 
now.  Those  with  access  to  internet  can

Never  Say  Die

really  comfortable  with  the  govern- 
ment treating  you  like  a  slave  and 
telling  you  what  you  have  to  do. 

If  The  Schools  Are  So  Bad,  What 
Can  Be  Done? 

I've  covered  my  recommendations 
for  a  totally  new  kind  of  educational 
system  in  my  book,  Declare  War,  so  I 
woni  go  into  the  gory  details  here. 
Briefly,  I  recommend  school  be  made 
non-compulsory;  that  tests  and  grades 
be  eliminated;  teachers  be  replaced 
by  team  leaders;  schools  be  open 
year  around:  ed  schools  be  closed: 
teacher  certification  ended;  radio, 
computer  and  other  high -tech  clubs  be 
encouraged;  and  so  on.  Probably 
nothing  you'd  be  interested  in. 

If  you  do  want  to  learn  more  about 
education  you  can  access  a  list  of  the 
books  I've  read  on  the  subject  on  the 
73  BBS  (603-924-9343). 

My,  How  Things  Have  Changed! 

And  Not  for  the  Better! 

Us  oTd-timers  have  noticed  the  way 
"the  world  has  changed"  More  crime, 
drugs,  riots,  poverty,  divorce,  home- 
lessness.  and  porno.  Family  life  is  less 
like  the  Nelsons  and  more  like  the 
Simpsons  these  days. 

You  don't  suppose  there  could  be 
any  connection  between  all  this  and 
our  educational  system,  do  you?  Isn't 
what  we're  seeing  happening  exactly 
what  you'd  expect  from  the  education 
John  Gatto  was  forced  to  provide? 
And  which  he  got  awards  for  provid- 
ing? 

But,  other  than  sit  around  and  wring 
our  hands,  what  can  we  do  about  it? 
The  educational  establishment  has 
our  hands  lied.  Let's  say  that  you're 
the  one  parenl  in  a  hundred  (or  thou- 
sand) who  actually  takes  a  look  at  the 
stupid  books  your  kids  are  using  for 
texts  and  you  get  angry  enough  to 
want  to  at  least  get  the  kids  better 
books  from  which  to  learn.  You'll  soon 
find  out  what  you're  up  against. 

The  books  am  selected  by  the  local 
school  board.  You  talk  wilh  them  and 
find  they  know  little  about  the  books. 
They  just  use  the  recommended  book 
list.  So  why  not  run  for  the  school 
board  so  you  can  start  changing 
things? 

Two  years  later  you've  made  it. 
Then  you  find  that  getting  better  books 
onto  the  list,  even  ff  there  are  any,  is  a 
mulli  year  project,  it  seems  that  the 
state  textbook  commission  reviews  the 
books  for  any  specific  course  once  ev- 
ery five  years  And  here  you'll  find 
yourself  up  against  a  well-healed 
sales  force  from  the  bigger  publishers. 

You're  up  against  institutionalized 
mediocrity.  The  books  are  lousy.  Many 
teachers  are  bad.  The  classrooms  and 
bells  are  bad.  The  curriculum  stinks. 
Our  educational  system  doesn't  need 
a  patch  job,  It  needs  re-inventing. 
Patching  will  be  fought  at  every  fevel 
by  the  entrenched  system  .  .  .  teach- 
ers, administrators,  unions*  textbook 

80  73  Amateur  Radio  Today  *  May, 


publishers,  school  boards,  and  a  host 
of  government  agencies  dependent  on 
the  status  quo. 

Is  the  situation  really  hopeless? 
They  got  us  when  we  were  kids  and 
did  us  in.  They're  doing  the  same  thing 
to  our  children  and  grandchildren.  Is 
there  no  way  to  slop  this  institutional- 
ized massacre  of  our  kids  minds?  Not 
unless  you  get  mad  enough  to  break 
through  the  wan  of  apathy  the  system 
has  built  for  you.  Not  unless  you  really 
want  something  better  for  your  children 
and  your  country. 

A  good  educational  system  can 
make  all  the  difference,  It  can  end 
poverty  It's  the  only  way  to  end  pover- 
ty Just  taking  money  away  from  those 
who  worked  hard  for  it  and  giving  it  to 
those  who  haven't  bothered  to  get  an 
education  because  the  system  defeat- 
ed them  isn't  a  good  answer.  We've 
tried  that  and  it  hasn't  worked. 

A  good  educational  system  will  cost 
much  less  than  the  bloated  bureaucra- 
cy we  have  now.  I  til  prepare  our  Kids 
to  be  competitive  in  the  21st  century 
with  the  other  industrial  nations.  It'll 
give  them  a  happier,  belter  quality  of 
life.  U1 1  bring  back  inventiveness  and 
creativity.  It'll  greatly  reduce  crime  and 
drug  dependency  It'll  end  welfare,  cut 
down  on  teenage  suicide,  reduce  di- 
vorces, improve  our  health,  and  per- 
haps even  get  us  interested  enough  In 
government  so  welt  end  the  corrup- 
tion in  Washington, 

None  of  this  is  going  to  happen  with 
the  school  system  we  have  now. 
These  miseries  are  artifacts  of  the 
system.  If  people  paid  a  fraction  of 
the  attention  to  fixing  our  educational 
system  that  they  do  to  ball  games, 
we'd  be  richer,  happier,  and  healthier 
Can  it  happen?  You  toil  me. 

Basis  &  Purpose  Circa  1994 

The  original  basis  and  purpose  for 
the  amateur  radio  service,  as  set  out 
in  97.  T,  and  enacted  by  Congress  al- 
most 60  years  ago,  back  in  1934,  is  so 
totally  out  of  date  that  it's  about  time 
(or  the  Commission  to  consider  rewrit- 
ing our  charter,  A  lot  of  water  has 
gone  over  the  bridge  Since  then. 

One  of  the  basic  reasons  for  allo- 
cating bfg  gobs  of  Ihe  radio  spectrum 
for  amateurs  was  so  that  in  case  of 
war  we'd  be  able  to  provide  a  pool  of 
trained  Morse  code  skilled  operators, 
plus  technically  skilled  personnel  to 
maintain  communications  equipment. 
These  reasons  bore  splendid  fruit 
when  WWII  came  atong  and  80%  of 
our  licensed  amateurs  went  to  war.  I 
was  one  of  the  technicians,  so  I  can 
attest  to  the  validity  of  this  purpose. 

Further,  the  government  bought  our 
receivers  from  us  for  war  useT  so  we 
provided  an  extra  benefit.  My  Halli- 
crafters  SX-24  was  sent  to  Brazil  to 
help  provide  communications  for  the 
government's  Rubber  Development 
Corporation,  a  project  to  try  and  grow 
rubber  trees  in  the  Amazon  River  area 
to  make  up  for  our  loss  of  rubber  from 
Malaysia,  after  it  had  been  taken  over 
by  the  Japanese.  I  wonder  whatever 
happened  to  that  wartime  project .  . , 
I've  never  seen  it  written  up  anywhere. 

1  ^7^?0 


My  old  SX-24  may  still  be  sitting 
somewhere  in  the  Amazon  rain  forest 
In  an  abandoned  building. 

Another  stated  purpose  for  our 
'service*  was  for  us  to  help  pioneer 
new  communications  modes  and  lech- 
nologies.  Plus,  we  were  supposed  to 
provide  emergency  communications  to 
he!p  build  international  friendships. 

My,  how  things  have  changed  in 
only  60  years!  The  military  has  as 
much  use  for  CW  today  as  smoke  sig- 
nals. And  modem  equipment  servicing 
is  done  by  exchanging  modules,  not 
by  electronic  technicians  and  lest 
equipment,  Military  equipment  is  so 
specialized  today  that  99.9%  of  us 
would  be  unable  to  help  fix  it.  Heck, 
what  percentage  of  today's  hams  can 
fix  their  own  digitally  synthesized 
transceivers?  The  military  have  no  fur- 
ther use  for  hams,  even  if  we  were 
young  enough  to  be  of  interest  to 
them. 

We've  seen  the  whole  concept  of 
war  change.  When  WWII  came  along 
we  had  a  year  or  so  to  train  people 
and  build  equipment.  Now  we  have 
100-hour  wars.  The  military  don't  even 
need  our  frequencies  any  more  .  *  . 
and  they're  sure  not  going  to  have 
much  use  for  our  ham  rigs,  None  of 
these  things  happened  during  the  Ko- 
rean or  Vietnam  wars,  and  we  have  no 
prospect  of  them  happening  in  any  fu- 
ture conflicts  we  can  envision.  Modem 
military  communications  equipment  is 
just  too  specialized. 

If  we're  going  to  bring  the  Basis  & 
Puipose  up-to-date  we  need  lo  rewrite 
it  to  fit  our  1 993  world. 

We  might  start  out  with  97.1a,  stat- 
ing that  the  number  one  purpose  of 
amateur  radio  is  to  provide  entertain- 
ment for  a  group  of  largely  retired  mid- 
dle income  older  white  men.  A  second 
purpose  is  to  provide  entertainment  for 
the  mentally  deranged,  thus  keeping 
them  from  committing  more  heinous 
crimes.  Better  they  enjoy  spewing  fifth 
on  14.313,  Jamming  traffic  and  emer- 
gency nets,  creating  pile-ups  to  the 
disgust  of  foreign  operators,  and  vent- 
ing their  spleens  over  our  repeaters, 
than  molesting  little  girls  ...  or  young 
boys,  as  one  of  our  best  known  pio- 
neer repeater  chaps  did,  Oh  yes.  I 
seem  to  remember  a  convention  chair- 
man who  got  caught  at  this  too. 

About  the  only  original  purpose 
we're  still  hanging  in  there  on  is  emer- 
gency communications.  Bui  we're  be- 
ing squeezed  hard  on  this  by  CB,  cel- 
lular phones  and  other  new  technolo- 
gies. If  our  emergency  systems  aren't 
capable  of  tying  CB.  our  ham  re- 
peaters, cellular  phones,  police,  fire 
and  other  emergency  services  togeth- 
er, we're  not  going  to  be  needed  tor 
long.  We  need  to  dean  up  our  act  in 
this  respect.  Any  volunteers  to  write 
articles  to  help  our  ham  clubs  get  up- 
to-date  in  emergency  communica- 
tions? 

We're  so  far  beninti  in  technology 
these  days  that  it's  unlikely  we'll  ever 
be  able  to  do  much  pioneering  again. 
We  certainly  did  do  a  fine  job  a  gener- 
ation back,  with  our  pioneering  of  FM, 
NBFM,  RTTY,  SS8,  SSTV,  meteor 


scatter  and  moonbounce  communica- 
tions, and  repeaters-  Then,  30  years 
ago,  we  dropped  the  ball. 

A  New  Manifesto 

My  own  agenda  is  to  make  our  pri- 
ority the  attracting  of  new,  young  hams 
to  the  hobby  as  a  way  to  help  our 
country  generate  the  high-tech  work 
force  which  is  going  to  be  needed  if 
we're  going  to  maintain  a  good  quality 
of  life.  If  we  can  do  that  we'd  be  well 
worth  the  investment  in  the  spectrum 
allocated  to  us. 

If  we  can  generate  a  hundred  thou- 
sand school  radio  clubs  with  an  aver- 
age of  25  members  per  club,  well 
have  the  work  force  we  need  to  invent, 
build,  sell  and  service  the  technology 
of  the  2 1st  century. 

Next,  we  need  to  update  our  emer- 
gency communications  systems.  I'd 
like  to  keep  that  as  one  of  our  purpos- 
es. But  none  of  this  CW  traffic  net 
baloney.  Any  system  which  can't  han- 
dle at  least  9600  baud  won't  be  of 
much  value  This  means  we  need  lo 
get  busy  developing  effective  HF 
packet  systems  which  will  give  us  Ihe 
throughput  we  need,  We're  doing  fine 
on  the  VHFs,  but  we  still  need  to  be 
able  to  get  the  traffic  dependably 
through  QRM,  QRN,  QSB,  and  so  on. 
In  my  past  editorials  I've  shown  how 
we  can  establish  a  communication 
protocol  which  will  enable  us  to  auto- 
matically translate  our  messages  into 
any  language  in  the  world  and  have  a 
throughput  of  25,000  words  per 
minute. 

I  like  the  concept  of  building  inter* 
national  friendships,  but  that's  com- 
pletely incompatible  with  the  ARRL 
DXCC  Honor  Roll,  so  one  or  the  other 
will  have  to  go.  Maybe  we  can  get  the 
League  to  curb  some  of  their  endless 
contests  too.  These  are  not  interna- 
tional friendship  builders. 

Please  let  me  know  what  you  sug- 
gest in  the  way  of  a  new  Basis  and 
Purpose  for  97.1. 

Tackling  the  Deficit 

Let's  say  that  you  buy  a  house  and 
find  an  old  painting  in  the  attic.  You  take 
it  down  to  a  local  antique  shop  and  they 
give  you  $100  for  it,  Wow!  Then  you 
read  in  the  paper  that  the  store  has  sold 
it  for  $7  million.  Would  you  be  upset? 
Remember,  you  got  what  you  thought 
was  a  good  price  for  it 

WellT  there's  this  1872  law  on  the 
books  saying  Uncle  Sam  has  to  sell 
land  for  $2.50  an  acre.  One  parcel  of 
17.000  acres  they  sold  for  $42,500 
was  resold  a  few  days  later  for  $37 
million,  Did  that  make  Uncle  mad 
enough  to  change  the  taw?  Har  de 
har.  Some  of  the  $2.50  parcels  of  land 
are  near  the  gambling  casinos  in  Las 
Vegas  and  have  appraised  values  up 
to  $47  million. 

Nearer  to  our  hearts  is  the  incredi- 
ble Uncle  Sam  (and  that  means  us 
taxpayers,  buddy)  giveaway  of  radio 
frequencies.  We're  giving  away  our  ra- 
dio and  TV  channels  for  free,  even 
though  the  users  are  making  billions

using  them.  Ditto  cellular  telephone 
channels,  and  so  on.  Isn't  it  about 
time  we  started  getting  a  piece  of  the 
action  back  from  these  humongous 
industries  which  are  using  our  proper- 
ty to  make  money? 

It  someone  set  up  Shop  on  your 
front  lawn  and  started  selling  things, 
wouldn't  you  at  least  expect  a  cut  of 
the  actk>n?  When  you  open  a  store  in 
a  shopping  mall  you  have  to  agree  to 
pay  a  percentage  of  your  sales  to  the 
matl  in  exchange  for  the  location,  ts 
there  any  reason  we  shouldn't  ask  the 
commercial  radio  and  TV  users  to  pay 
maybe  10%  of  their  revenues  for  the 
use  of  our  property?  That  would  add  a 
few  billion  to  the  Treasury.  The  esti- 
mate is  that  we're  giving  away  S32  bil- 
lion Just  for  the  cellular  channels. 

Of  course,  until  you  gel  Congress 
to  change,  all  more  revenues  will 
mean  is  more  spending.  It  won't  cut 
our  taxes  one  nickel  There  are  tons 
of  ways  for  Congress  to  cut  spending. 
but  none  of  them  are  yet  deemed 
necessary.  What  most  people  don't 
understand  is  that  no  one  is  actually 
running  the  government.  Congress 
makes  laws  and  Ihe  president  han- 
dles foreign  policy  and  is  commander 
In  chief  of  the  military.  But  there's  no 
one  minding  the  store,  so  we  see 
endless  bureaucratic  waste,  with  no 
easy  way  to  curb  it. 

Waste?  How  about  $4.9  billion  a 


year  for  outside  consultants  for  gov- 
ernment bureaus?  That's  according 
to  the  government  accounting  office. 
How  about  51 .5  biltion  for  Congres- 
sional staffs?  We  could  cut  $30  billion 
if  we  ended  farm  subsidies,  and  that 
doesn't  count  how  much  we'd  save 
on  tower  food  prices,  whicn  are  now 
being  supported.  Then  there  are 
failed  farm  loans,  where  we've  donat- 
ed about  $10  billion  to  the  farmers. 
We  might  want  to  cut  down  on  the 
$22  billion  in  food  stamps  too. 

I'll  be  writing  about  this  fn  more 
detail  In  my  Declare  War  Update 
newsletter,  which  genuine  Wayne 
Green -haters  should  consider  buying, 
as  it  will  give  them  plenty  more  to 
hate.  There  are  some  fascinating  re- 
cent books  which  go  into  the  gory 
details  on  how  Congress  is  screwing 
us,  but  a  warning  .  .  .  they  could  pos- 
sibly make  you  mad.  They  could  even 
put  a  strain  on  your  12  to  16  years  of 
conditioning  in  our  school  system  to 
not  cause  trouble  and  to  do  as  you're 
told.  I  know  I  almost  got  mad.  Worse. 
It  almost  made  me  think! 

One  ol  the  most  amusing  books  on 
government  waste  is  O'Rourke's  Par- 
liament of  Whores.  P.J.  shows  how 
Congress  could  quickly  cut  $337  bil- 
lion off  the  budget,  without  even  get- 
ting to  the  small,  half-billlon-doliar, 
items.  Then  there's  Gross'  Govern- 
ment Racket — Washington    Waste 


From  A  to  Z,  And  if  that  doesn't  hold 
you,  check  out  Kelly's  Adventums  in 
Porkland  —  How  Washington  Wastes 
Your  Money  and  Why  They  Won't 
Stop.  These  are  just  new  books  on 
the  subject.  There's  nothing  new 
about  egregious  waste  in  Washing- 
ton. I've  got  stacks  of  books  going 
back  10,  20  and  30  years,  all  describ- 
ing the  waste  .  ,  .  and  nothing  has 
ever  come  of  it  * . .  or  changed, 

Tne  probability  is  high  that  nothing 
will  change  this  time,  except  that  the 
deficit  and  taxes  will  continue  to  rise. 

Continuing  Unemployment 

I  see  they're  extending  the  unem- 
ployment benefits  because  people 
aren't  finding  Jobs.  I  think  I  know 
what's  wrong.  I've  talked  with  some 
local  businessmen  and  find  they're 
having  the  same  problem  I  am.  They 
need  more  people.  They're  desperate 
for  more  people.  But  the  job  appli- 
cants just  aren't  what  they  need. 

What's  happened  in  New  Hamp- 
shire .  .  .  and  all  around  the  country 
.  .  ,  is  that  larger  firms  have  been 
laying  off  their  high-priced  mid- 
management  staffers.  These  people 
have  been  used  to  making  $50,000 
and  up  a  year,  but  having  worked  in 
mid-management,  they've  little  expe- 
rience or  confidence  in  making  deci- 
sions. What  the  smaller  businesses 
need  are  people  who  can  siart  at 


around  $20t000  and  work  their  way 
up  by  generating  sales.  Someone 
who's  geared  to  making  $50,000  has 
the  wrong  house,  car,  clothes,  out- 
look, work  habits,  eats  at  the  wrong 
restaurants,  and  so  forth.  Worse, 
they're  used  to  that  and  are  not  rnucn 
interested  in  settling  (or  a  S20.000 
lifestyle.  So  the  job  market  is  glutted 
with  over-priced,  unde retrained  peo- 
ple. Meanwhile,  small  businesses 
which  need  more  help  aren't  able 
to  find  anybody  they  can  hire.  There 
just  aren't  many  unemployed  who 
can  satisfy  the  needs  of  small  busi- 
nesses. 

I  have  some  great  openings  here 
,  .  .  on  73  and  Radio  Funt  and  to 
help  start  a  couple  new  magazines, 
but  finding  people  interested  in 
actually  working  hasn't  been  easy , . . 
and  we've  been  interviewing  for 
months.

Hams  In  Low  Places 

It  appears  that  the  FCC  has  finally 
given  up  on  the  notion  that  the  Amateur 
Radio  Service  is  self -policing,  especially 
when  it  comes  to  the  odd  assortment  of 
human  flotsam  and  jetsam  that  washes 
up  on  14.313,  The  FCC  has  finally  an- 
swered the  cries  of  the  thousands  of  am- 
ateurs who  operate  legally  and  courte- 
ously, by  stepping  up  their  monitoring  of 
the  14.313  cesspool  and  passing  out 
some  nice  fat  fines.  Bravo,  FCC!  Please, 
keep  up  the  good  work. 

When  you  add  in  all  the  other  hams 
who  have  found  themselves  on  the  fuzzy 
end  of  the  legal  lollipop  stick,  amateur 
raoio  is  starting  to  look  more  tike  Ameri- 
ca's Most  Wanted.  We've  opt  illegal  VE 
testing  sessions,  we've  got  false  distress 
calls  on  the  high  seas,  and  of  course 
there's  always  the  illegal  long  distance 
exploits  of  everybody's  favorite  big 
mouth.  Herbie  Schoenbohm  KV4F7.  It 
seems  that  Herbie.  who  has  so  tar  avoid- 
ed an  FCC  Notice  Of  Apparent  Liability 
(though  many  of  us  are  stilt  hoping), 
has  also  avoided  any  kind  of  serious 
penalty  for  his  theft  of  long  distance  ser- 
vice. He  was  originally  convicted  on 
three  counts,  but  an  appeal  got  him  off 
two  of  them.  He  was  sentenced  to  two 
months  of  house  arrest  (kinda  like  being 
grounded,  except  it's  by  a  judge  instead 
of  your  parents),  and  ordered  to  pay  a 
$51D00  fine.  Herbie  has  reportedly  vowed 
to  appeal  the  remaining  conviction,  alt 
the  way  to  the  United  States  Supreme 
Court.  It  always  amazes  me  how 
biowhards  and  big  mouths  who  get 
caught  with  their  hands  in  the  cookie 
jar  think  they  can  appeal  their  little  case 
to  the  Supreme  Court.  Herbie  should 
read  a  book  or  something,  because  I  can 
guarantee  him  that  the  Supreme  Court 
won't  be  interested  in  reviewing  his  case. 
Of  course,  it  is  mighty  difficult  to  hear 
and  learn  something  when  your  mouth  is 
always  open. 

I  have  to  admit*  I  am  a  bit  biased 
when  It  comes  to  discussion  of  Mr. 
Shoenbohm  (watch  out.  faithful  reader, 
here  comes  the  dreaded  "personal  anec- 
dote"). Other  than  my  fundamental  dis- 
like for  ignorance  that  passes  as  Fnsight 
because  gf  shear  volume,  I  have  had  a 
single  personal  contact  with  Herbie  that 
left  me  less  than  impressed.  It  was  the 
week  we  started  sending  American 
troops  over  to  Saudi  Arabia  in  Operation 
Desert  Shield,  what  would  eventually  be- 
come Operation  Desert  Storm,  I  was 
driving  home  from  work  and  turned  on 
rny  HF  mobile  rig.  I  finished  a  nice  chat 
with  a  fellow  in  Manchester,  England, 
and  was  tuning  up  the  band,  when  I 
came  upon  KV4F2"$  afternoon  speech. 
He  and  a  buddy  of  his  were  operating  a 
phoney  net.  They  were  being  so  ludi- 
crous that  no  one  would  have  mistaken 
what  they  were  doing  tor  anything  other 
than  a  joke.  I  have  no  problem  with 
jokes.  I  had  a  major  problem  with  what 
Herbie  chose  as  the  subject  of  his  joke. 
He  and  his  buddy  were  acting  like  some 
kind  of  para- military  relief  net  for  the  op- 
erations in  Saudi  Arabia.  Even  if  I  didn't 
have  two  retatrves  who  had  been  pad  of 
the  operation  (which  I  did),  and  no  matter 
how  I  felt  about  President  Bush's  deci- 
sion to  send  American  troops  to  that 
Godforsaken  part  of  the  world  (I  had 
mixed  feelings),  I  stai  think  that  what  Her-

bie  and  his  pal  were  doing  was  in  poor 
taste. 

I  sent  out  my  callsign,  was  recog- 
nized, and  had  a  short  conversation  with 
KV4FZ  I  asked  him  if  he  could  see  how 
many  people  wouldn't  find  his  joking 
about  a  potentially  deadly  situation  in- 
volving American  soldiers  humorous. 
Herbie  launched  into  some  incoherent  di- 
atribe about  how  we  had  no  business  be- 
ing over  there,  and  how  Bush  was  a 
dupe  of  the  oil  companies,  blah,  blah 
blah,  yuckt  yuck,  yuck.  1  returned  and 
told  Herbie  that  most  people  didn't  care 
about  the  political  or  corporate  ramifica- 
tions of  Operation  Desert  Shield,  I  told 
him  that  It  wasn't  about  Bush,  or  oi  com- 
panies, or  American* Israeli  relations  or 
any  other  complex  matter.  Once  we  had 
American  men  and  women  camped  out 
on  the  sand  of  Saudi  Arabia,  it  was  a 
simple  question  of  how  many  of  those 
young  Americans  would  die  before  ft  was 
all  over,  1  guess  this  concept  was  too 
large  to  fit  Herbie's  narrow  frame  of  refer- 
ence. I  dont  think  he  understood  what  I 
was  trying  to  say,  so  1  signed  off.  Herbie 
and  his  buddy  continued  their  fun  and 
games. 

White  Herbie  has  yet  to  get  caught  in 
the  act  of  pulling  illegal  amateur  radio 
tricks,  others  have  not  been  as  lucky. 
William  Moskowitz  KA3HSZ  of  Piano, 
Texas,  will  soon  be  cutting  a  check  to 
Uncle  Charlie  for  $2,000.  Bilry-boy  is  get- 
ting off  easy,  because  ifs  his  first  of- 
fense. The  base  amount  for  malicious  in- 
terference is  $7,000,  but  the  FCC  said 
they'd  give  Bill  a  break  this  first  time. 
Mighty  nice  of  "em,  doncha  think? 

The  FCC  wasn't  as  lentenl  with  big- 
time  offender  Richard  Whiten  WB20TK 
of  Taylors,  South  Carolina.  Dickie  will 
soon  be  "contribuling"  a  whopping 
$10N500  to  the  national  debt.  The  FCC 
stated  that  they  were  really  socking  it  to 
Dick  because  of  ""repeated  violation  ol 
rule  97.01(D),"  Actually,  I  suspect  that 
Whitten  got  slapped  with  such  a  stiff 
penalty  because  his  defense  was  so 
larne^  He  didn't  deny  making  the  trans- 
missions in  question,  but  said  that  they 
weren't  malicious  interference  because 
"if  I  had  truly  wanted  to  willfully  and  mali- 
ciously interfere,  I  could  have  done  so  to 
such  an  extent  that  communications  be- 
tween other  amateur  radio  operators 
would  have  been  impossible."  Is  that  not 
priceless?  Maybe  we  shoukJ  cafl  this  the 
"Btg  Gun  Defense." 

Of  course,  I  do  have  to  express  a  little 
sympathy  for  Mr.  Whiten,  since  the  guy 
he  was  accused  of  maliciously  interfering 
with  was  Michael  Galego  KA4MUJ 
Mikey  hasn't  paid  the  piper  yel,  but  like 
his  buddy  H&tj  Shoenbohm  KV4FZ,  ifs 
just  a  matter  of  time  before  the  FCC 
catches  him  doing  something.  KA4MUJ 
is  perhaps  the  most  frequent  callsign 
heard  on  14.313.  Not  only  is  he  on  the 
air  himself  at  all  hours  of  the  day  and 
night,  but  others  make  tapes  of  his  inane 
ramblings  and  play  them  back  over 
14.313  when  hefs  not  around.  When  he 
is  understandable  (his  words  are  so  often 
slurred  that  it  is  difficult  to  understand 
what  he's  saying),  Mikey  can  come  up 
with  some  of  the  most  hateful,  ill-in- 
formed. anti-Semftic  crapoJa  this  side  of 
a  skinhead  convention.  He  adores  Herb 
Shoenbohm  to  the  point  of  suspicion, 
which  is  reason  enough  to  question  his

The  following  times  are  given  in  Co-

used  to  be  called  Greenwich  Mean 
Time  (GMT).  When  using  the  band- 
time- country  chart  please  note  that 
highest  possible  frequency  is  used  for 
the  path  indicated.  For  the  WARC 
bands,  use  as  follows:  for  12  meters, 
use  10  and  15  data;  for  17  meters,  use 
15  and  20  data;  and  for  30  meters,  use 
20  and  30  data.  Sometimes  a  path  will 
open  on  a  band  higher  or  lower  than 
the  one  indicated,  so  be  sure  to  check 
those  as  well. 

The  propagation  report  for  May  con- 
tains some  days  thai  are  Very  Poor  or 
Poor.  These  are  expected  to  occur  on 
the  4th,  9th  and  10th;  on  the  16th 
through  the  18th;  on  the  21st  through 
the  22nd;  and  on  the  25th.  You  will  note 
that  there  are  only  12  Fair  or  Fair-to- 
Good  days  forecast.  May  will  be  a 
month  of  unsettled  ionospheric 
conditions  and  an  actiwe-to- 
storm  level  magnetic  field  on  the 
days  shown  as  Poor  or  Very 
Poor.  Also,  some  intense  geo- 
physical effects  may  be  noticed 
on  the  days  surrounding  the 
17th  of  the  month.  Guile  often 
you  will  notice  that  the  forecast 
conditions  lake  place  a  day  or 
two  before  or  after  the  forecast 
date,  so  always  check  the  WVW 
broadcasts  at  18  minutes  after 
any  hour  to  discover  the  trend  in 
solar  tlux,  and  the  Boulder  A  and 
K  indexes.  Remember  that  the 
higher  the  solar  flux,  and  the 
tower  the  A  and  K  indexes,  the 
better  tho  propagation  will  be. 

May  is  also  a  month  for 
trends  from  spring  propagation 
{usually  quite  good)  to  summer 
conditions  {usually  quite  poor  as 
compared  with  spring  and  fall). 
The  reason  for  this  ts  the  higher- 
than- usual  absorption  during  the 
hours  after  noon,  particularly  on 
the  lower  HF  bands.  The  iono- 
sphere tends  to  be  a  poor  reflec- 
tor during  those  hours.  Short 
skip  on  the  higher  HF  bands  will 
be  quite  good  on  many  days  as 
these  frequencies  are  less  af- 
fected than  the  lower  ones.  You 
may  have  noticed  that  the  30. 
40,  80  and  160  meter  bands  are 
always  better  during  early  mom-

ing  and  late  afternoon  and  evening 
hours.  May  always  brings  increased 
thunderstorm  activity  in  the  Northern 
Hemisphere,  so  GRN  will  be  high  on 
many  days. 

Note,  also,  that  we  are  now  in  the 
last  few  years  of  declining  sunspot  ac- 
tivity when  the  higher  HF  bands  will  suf- 
fer the  most  Therefore,  you  will  find  that 
working  DX  is  more  difficult  in  general 
on  the  bands  from  10  through  20  me-

while  the  sun  shines."  which  also  ap- 
plies to  our  radio  activities  in  the  years 
of  declining  sunspots.
