completion  to  conform  to  any  wel  spacing  or  density  pattern  that  may  be  prescribed  or  permitted  by  any  governmental  authority  having  jurisdiction  to  do  so.  for  the  purpose  , 
of  the  foregoing,  the  terms  "oil  well0  and  "gas  well"  sttal  have  the  meanings  prescribed  by  applicable  law  or  the  appropriate  governmental  authority,  or,  if  no  definition  Is  so  ; :

Production,  drilling  or  reworking  operations  anywhere  an  a  urit  which  includes  all  or  any  part  of  the  I  Based  premises  shall  be.treate^  as^if  itwere  pipduction  .^drilling,  or*^

ownership  shall  have  the  effect  of  reducing  the  rights  or  enlarging  the  obigstions  of  Lessee  hereunder,  and  no  change  in  ownership  shall  be  binding  an  Lessee  until  60  days 
after  Lessee  has  been  furnished  the  original  or  certified  or  duly  authenticated  copies  of  the  documents  establishing  such  change  of  ownership  to  the  satisfaction  of  Lessee  or 
until  Lessor  has  satisfied  the  notification  requirements  contained  in  Lessee's  usual  form  or  division  order.  In  the  event  of  the  death  of  any  person  entitled  to  shut-In  royalties 
hereunder,  Lessee  may  pay  or  tender  such  shut-in  royalties  to  the  credit  of  decedent  or  decedent's  estate  in  the  depository  designated  above.  If  at  any  time  two  or  more

arising  with  respect  to  the  transferred  interest,  and  faiure  of  the  transferee  to  satisfy  such  obligations  with  respect  to  the  transferred  interest  shall  not  affect  the  rights  of 
Lessee  with  respect  to  any  interest  not  so  transferred.  If  Lessee  transfers  a  full  or  undivided  interest  in  ad  or  any  portion  of  the  area  covered  by  this  lease,  the  obligation  to 
pay  or  tender  shut-in  royalties  hereunder  shall  be  cfivided  between  Lessee  and  the  transferee  in  proportion  to  the  net  acreage  interest  in  this  lease  then  held  by  each. 

9.  Lessee  may,  at  any  time  and  from  time  to  time,  deliver  to  Lessor  or  tile  of  record  a  written  release  of  this  lease  as  to  a  fuli  or  undivided  interest  in  all  or  any  portion  of 
the  area  covered  by  this  lease  or  any  depths  or  zones  thereunder,  and  shall  thereupon  be  relieved  of  al  abSgations  thereafter  arising  with  respect  to  the  interest  so  released. 
If  Lessee  releases  all  or  an  undivided  Interest  in  less  than  all  of  the  area  covered  hereby,  Lessee's  obligation  to  pay  or  tender  shut-in  royalties  shal  be  proportionately  reduced
