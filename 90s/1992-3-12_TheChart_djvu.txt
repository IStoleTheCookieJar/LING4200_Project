>» ACADEMIC AFFAIRS 


Calendar makes_ 
spring break late 


By JEFFREY SLATTON 
KSSOCIATE EDITOR. 


Ithough the weather has been, 
warm of late, spring break at 
Missouri Southern Is still an 


other week away 
Dr. Robert Brown, vice president 
for academic affairs, said spring 
break is one of many events an a very 
complex calendar for the College 
‘Our calendar is made up two 





years in advance, 
with the catalog 


in conjunction 
he sald. ~One fac 
tor that determines when spring 
break willbe is when New: Year's 
Day is going to be each year 

Brown said after the first of the 
year, the College tries to, pick the 
first practical starting date to begin 
classes 

They try to place spring break 
roughly fn the middle of the semes 





ter. 

We try for between the ninth and 
eleventh week: the end of the first 
half of classes.” Brown said. 

Brown said one additional plus to 
the timing of this year's spring break 
is that Joplin R-8, Webb City R-7, 
and Carl Junction R-1 school dis 
tricts all have the same spring break 
as Southern, 

Tve had a lot of requests from 
students and faculty that if jt was 
‘ever possible to have the same spring 
break as the local schools, to do it 
Brown said. 

In. determining the calendar, 
Brown said there are three main fac. 
tors that go into the planning: it 
must be academically feasible. ac 









al arts education, these 
would come here and learn 
she said. “I think 


getting a lib 
peop! 
open-mindednes 
people are tal 
sided. It’s forci 
make their own p just 
because they can’t find social solace 
‘on our campus” 

St Clair believes bee 
n-minded could help t 
“Somebody you sit next to in class, 
sommate, the person you car 
pool with—could be gay.” she said. 
“That you can be open:minded—I 
hope that's the emphasis everyone 
gets [from the lecture] 

The Feb. 24 issue of Newsweek 
published a report concering the 
possibility of homosexuality being 




















overall 














commodate as much of th 





body as possible, and acec 
the faculty and staff 

Other schools in Missourl have 
differing spring breaks. The Univer. 
sily of Missouri-St: Louis (March 
2-6), has one of the earllest spring 
breaks, while the University. of 
Misouri-Rolla has one of the latest 
(March 31-April 4), 

Brown said the reason for differ- 
ing spring breaks is there is no 
unified calendar. 

“I don't think we want that? he 
said. “We don’t want someone in Jef: 
ferson City telling us when we can 
and can’t have classes 

“One reason for different spring 
break dates might be a different 
semester starting date 

He said another consideration go- 
Ing into the calendar {s Southern’s 
academic calendar is the longest in 
the state 

Wo provide » complete, full se- 
ester, he said. 

Charles Henry, sophomore chem- 
{stry major, said the long number of 
weeks before break burn out the 
students 

Tt seems like all my friends (at 
other schools) are out this week or 
nett” he said. “I'd fust really wish 
it was earlier” 

Differences between schools exist 
even within the University of 
Missouri system, Each campus has 
its own time for spring break. Bet: 
ween UMSL and UMR are the 
University of Missouri-Kansas City 
(March 9:13) and the University of 
Missouri-Columbla (March 23.27) 


























Homophobia alive and well at Southern, students say 


geoctically-linked. Blumenfeld, who 
has studied homosexuality for 22 
years, believes this fs not the issue at 
hand. 

“I think there is an, underlying 
bias in looking at the cause." he said. 
At this point, [ really don't care why 
T'm gay= 

Blumenfeld also said homosexuals 
face difficulties which separate them 
from all other minority groups 

“In many ways were acommunity 
of orphans,” he said. =We'e really 
the only minority that doesn't get the 
support of family and friends~ 

The thing that hurts the most is 
when they say I'm not normal or it’s 
ot natural,” the GALA vice-pres- 
ident said: “Iam normal; I'm just 
different”

independent viewpoints of columnists, cartoonists, 
and readers. 





Try tolerance 


top the hate. 
Whenever members of a minority 


group on campus insist their names 
be guarded and fear for their Safety, 
something has gone very wrong 

The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Support 
group has very quietly and peacefully gone 
about the business of trying to give 
homosexuals refuge from the hostility of the 
closed minds gays encounter here 

The Campus Activities Board has 
Scheduled a topical and meaningful lecture 
‘on homophobia for next week 

Dave Swenson regularly and courageously 
Q0es On record to encourage tolerance for 
everyone 

Warren Blumenfeld, the lecturer on 
homophobia, travels the country informing 
People that any prejudice is wrong 

We salute these groups and individuals 
for their efforts to bring down the walls of 
ignorance that seem to so effectively 
Surround Missouri Southern and southwest 
Missouri 

Not so long in our nation's past, Support 
groups for blacks, women, and other 
minorities were shunned as radical. Now, to 
belong to such organizations is acceptable 
to society. We've come a long way in the 
fight for equality for all men and women. 

But not far enough 

The civil rights train has left homosexuals 
at the station 

Lory St. Clair, lecturer chairman for the 
CAB, said “Somebody you sit next to in 
Class, your roommate, the person you 
carpool with—could be gay. That you can 
be open minded —I hope that’s the 
message everyone gels.” 

So do we, Lory. So do we. 


Spring fever 


Pring needs to be sprung. 
S We appreciate the difficulties of 
scheduling a calendar for an entire 
academic year, bul still cannot help but 
express our dismay at the fact that we must 
endure what seems like an eternity before 
we get a welcome rest 

As students of Missouri Southern, we 
have the longest academic calendar in the 
State. Such a long calendar has obvious 
academic benefits, bul everyone needs a 
fest. An earlier vacation would be a nice 
way to keep us interested in spending all 
that "time on task 

The coincidental timing of Southern’s 
spring break with the local public school 
districts’ is nice for faculty, staff, and 
non-traditional students who must care for 
their children. 

What about the rest, however? 

Even living on campus can be a trying 
and expensive experience. By the tenth 
week of school, many of the residence hall 
students likely could use a trip home to 
feplenish both their morale and their 
pocketbooks.

rae just increased again at Missouri 
Southern. So what else is new? 

J started back to college in the fall of 1986. 
At that time, college tuition was $37.50 an hour. 
Since then, tuition has climbed to $40.50 an 
hour, $48 an hour, $53 an hour, and now it will 
be $58 an hour in the fall of 1892 

Every time there is an increase. I hear the 
claim that Southern is one of the cheapest col- 
eges in the state. Quite frankly, I am tired of 
hearing this claim 

The biggest problem concerning the rising tui. 
ion costs begins in Jefferson City. There is less 
money for state-funded colleges and institutions 
every year. 

Southern became a fully state-funded college 


in 1975. At that time, the fecling war that 
becoming a fully state-funded college was neces 
sary. The problem is that every year more nicney 
is needed to fund state colleges and universities, 
The money is not there 

Proposition B proved that money needed for 
all education is in short supply. Asking the tax- 
payer to pay more for education is an unrea. 
sonable request 

What is the solution? This is a good ‘question. 
My intuition tells me college tuition is like a song 
Tremember when I was in high school. The song 
‘was tiled “Up, Up and Away”

Cignty as it is classically defined. 
The first generation began when 
the Red Cross entered into agree 
ments around the turn of the century 
With various countries to take care 
of those wounded on the battlefield. 
This was revolutionary at the time 
The second generation began with 
French volunteers of Medecins Sans 
Frontiers and other doctors working 
{in Biafra and later in Afghanistan to 
take care of victims on all sidex As 
doctors, they found it impossible to 
stop their care at the disputed border 
when a patient was bleeding to death 
on the other side 
As a result of these experiences, 
the U.N. in 1988 first established the 
Tight of “free access to the victims of 
natural disssters and other emergency 
situations” if the assisting agency 
was neutral 
Froe access to victims also had to 
follow the prinaple of “subsidiarity” 
a diplomatic way of saying that, if 
4 government cannot take care of all 
its population, then the neutral out 
side gency can be allowed to do so 
This was a very significant move for 
the United Nations, temple as it had 
Jong been of the concept of national 
sovereignty 
By 1990, the UN. had accepted 
the principle of “emergency buman- 
itarjan corridors” which made it 
possible to reconcile sovereign claims 
of nations with the concept of free 
access to the wounded. It is on this 
basis that the French government, 
along with the private organiza: 
tions, has established corridors in the 
southern Sudan, where 7,000 people 
‘were massacred this year with barely 
a mention in the Western’ media, 
and ferricd the wounded out of 
Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, when it was 
under siege We plan to establish 
corridors soon in Nagorno-Karabakh 
and Somalia 
The experience of humanitarian 
assistance to the Kurds in the after- 
math of the Gulf War, however, 
reveals very clearly the limits of “free 
‘aceess to victims” and underlines the 
need to move fully to the third gener 
ation of “preventive intervention” 
The Kurdish example was both a 
success and failiire for eases 
eration. The UN. High Commis

and in other non- protected Kurdish 
areas, the Iraqi army is again active 
and regular ‘bombings are taking tension. The 





training will 
take place out: Susan Koch

Upon siceeaful completion of her 
training, Koch will be placed in 
Ghana to work in a tree nursery 

“Twill be working with the people 
to encourage them to plant trees and 
making them aware of the conse 
quences of deforestation,~ she said.

fled the Kirkuk area for the safety 
of the mountains 

Talk of a “right to intervention” 
has naturally alarmed many people, 
especially those in the developling 
world who see it as another guise of 
the old imperialism. But let! me 
assure those who accure the emergent 
humanitarian army of acting on the 
basis that “might makes right™ On 
the contrary, we are trying to pro- 
tect the weakest and the disinher.

the world, as the United States did humidity in the mornings Koch said 
in Latin America or France did in 
Africa. Humanitarian intervention 
will be carried out by a ncutral, 
multinational force acting under the 
authority of international organiza- 
tions and controlled by them 

The charge of human rights im- 
perialism™ against local cultural 
norms is also not a valid argument 
against the right to intervene. Human 
rights are human rights. Freedom is 
freedom. Everywhere. If a Muslim 
‘woman in the Sudan opposes pain- 
ful clitoral excision, or if a Chinese 
woman oppases the binding of ber 
fect, her rights are being violated. 

To argue that such oppression is 
a part of the some inviolable cultural 
identity Is complete and utter non 
sense. When a patient suffers and 
desires care, she has the right to 
receive it: This also holds forbuman ould occur

STACY CAMPBELL 
‘If is one 
mighty big 
Sports term 


nice again it can be sald 
“Oh, what a difference a 
year makes” 


With another season gone, I 
can look back and/see the ad: 
Yancement from last season 

First, looking at the Lions 
basketball team which improved 
to 21-7 after finishing 11-17 last 
year. The Lions were also picked 
to finish sixth in the conference 
and pulled out third place 

The Lady Lions had/a mi 
raculous turn around) as well, 
finishing the year 18-10 and third 
in the conference, after last 
season's 12-15 mark and ninth: 
place finish in the MIAA 

The indoor track squads even 
made a reasonably nlce jump 
from last season. The men's team 
finished fifth, up from seventh 
last year, while the women posted 
the same sixth place finish as last 
year. But that is not all 

The Lions scored 53 points, 20 
more than last season, and the 
women improved by’ 15. 

Looking back to the fall, the 
football team and the volleyball 
team) both had! great im: 
provements and, of course. the 
cross country team showed de- 
velopment throughout the season. 

So what am T driving at? 

To put it simply, the efforts of 
these teams were great, but I no- 
iced the teams could not win the 
big” game or games 

The Lions’ football team bs the 
first on my chopping block. The 
team went from 4-5 to 8-3, and 
that’s great 

But with a single victory in 
the Pittsburg State game the 
Lions could have walked away 
with the conference title. In- 
stead, when the big game hit, 
they turned the ball over 10 (yes 
count ‘em 10) times as PSU 
romped 43-21 

The Lady Lions volleyball 
team also had its shot at the con 
ference crown and even had the 
home-court advantage to go with 
it) but they fell) to Central 
Missouri State in the “big” game 

If they could have pulled that 
win off, they would have secured 
an automatic bid to the regional 
volleyball tournament. Then they 
wouldn't have had’ reason to 
worry about getting screwed out 
of their opportunity to go to 
regionals 

Finally, the last fall sport to 
fet critiqued Is the men's cross 
country team. (I will not address 
the women’s team or the soccer 
squad because, in my opinion, 
they did all they could.) 

This one Is a hard one to com 
plain about since I have personal 
involvement in it, but the team 
was ranked as high as 12th in the 
country in Division IT, but man 
aged to finish only fourth In the 
conference 

Moving on to the winter 
sports, 1 start with the Lions 
basketball team. 

The Opportunity was knock 
ing on the door to be the con. 
ference champions during the 
final two weeks of the season, 
but it seemed the team went 
deaf 

After Missouri Western hit the 
skids, the Lions had an oppor 
tunity to move into a first-place 
tie and even pass them, but they 
hit the skids too. 

Ifthe Lions had continued 
playing as they were before the 
skid, they would have probably 
been playing for the conference 
champlorship Saturday at bome 
Tt would have been nice to be 
both the conference tournament 
and regular season champs 

Finally, the basketball Lady 
Lions won a “big” game this year 
when they defeated CMSU in 
ensburg, but went Mat in 




















the “bigger” game when a shot 
at the conference. title still 
existed 


‘Obviously, Washburn has the 
Lady Lions’ number, but if a 
team wants to be conference 
amps, it has to find a way to 
change that number.
