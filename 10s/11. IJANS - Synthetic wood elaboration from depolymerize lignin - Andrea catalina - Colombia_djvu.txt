This  research  purpose  is  to  determine  ideal  conditions  for  lignin  depolymerization  so  its  reactivity  may  be 


properties.  Process  was  made  in  three  stages.  First  stage  consisted  in  lignin  extraction  by  Sosa  Method  and  its  subsequent 
characterization  by  IR,  UV,  elemental  analysis  and  solubility.  Second  stage  consisted  in  lignin  depolymerization  by  UV 
irradiation  and  later  a hydroxymethylation  with  formaldehyde  was  made.  Third  stage  was  the  wood  product  elaboration 
with  modified  lignin  and  melamine-formaldehyde  using  rice  husk  as  natural  fiber.  In  second  stage,  optimum 
depolymerization  time  by  UV  irradiation  was  found,  it  was  12  h.  With  hydroxymethylation  process,  in  depolymerized 
lignin  oxygen  level  was  increased  to  32. 1 % so  more  reactive  sites  that  became  methylene  bridges  between  lignin  and  resin 
were  generated.  Polymerization  reaction  submitted  to  autoclave  (121°C  and  15  psi)  developed  a synthetic  wood  product 
with  better  mechanical  properties.

INTRODUCTION 

Due  to  indiscriminate  use  forests  logging  is  necessary  to  propose  alternatives  so  it  can  be  reduced.  Gaitan  et  al. 
(2006)  posed  the  possibility  to  manufacture  synthetic  wood  starting  with  reaction  between  phenol-formaldehyde  resin  and 
extracted  lignin  from  coal  peat  using  sawdust  and  paper  as  natural  fiber.  They  found  that  Sosa  extraction  method  yielded 
best  efficiency  for  lignin  production  than  Fukushina  and  sulfate  methods. 

Lignin  reactivity  in  natural  condition  is  too  low.  El  Mansouri  (2006)  found  that  its  hydroxymethylation  with 
formaldehyde  increased  its  reactivity.  This  procedure  joined  with  lignin  depolymerization  with  UV,  potentiated  its 
reactivity  as  posed  by  Gordilllo  and  Vega  (2010).  Besides,  they  found  that  the  best  resin  to  couple  with  lignin  was 
melamine-formaldehyde. 

This  research  aims  to  find  the  optimal  exposure  time  with  UV  irradiation  to  generate  a more  reactive  lignin,  as 
well  as  improve  the  reaction  conditions  in  the  elaboration  of  the  final  product. 

MATERIALS  AND  METHODS 

First  Stage 

Coal  characterization,  lignin  extraction  and  its  characterization  were  made  in  first  stage. 

Three  coal  samples  were  analyzed.  They  came  from  Paipa  - Boyaca  and  were  found  50  m deep.  They  were 
crushed  and  grinded  to  106  pm.  After,  they  were  characterized  by  next  analysis  according  to  ASTM  D 3172

(%  moisture-ASTM  D 3173,  % ash-ASTM  D 3174,  % volatile  matter-  ASTM  D 3175),  elemental  analysis 
(%  C,  H,  N,  S,  O)  with  the  FLASH  2000  Series  CHNSO  Automatic  Elemental  Analyzer  of  Thermo-scientific  and  calorific 
power  determination  by  IKA  C 2000  Basic  calorimeter. 

Humic  acids  were  extracted  by  Nagoya  Method  (Kuwatsuka,  1992)  from  236.22  g of  low  rank  coal.  For  lignin 
extraction,  202.54  g of  low  rank  coal  free  of  humic  acids  were  used.  It  was  made  by  Coal  Sosa  Standardized  Method 
(Jimenez,  J.  et  al.,  2012).  Obtained  solution  was  purified  adding  H2SO4  98%  drop  by  drop  until  gas  production  finished.  It 
was  necessary  to  let  it  rest  by  12  hours.  Lignin  was  separated  by  filtration  with  Whatman  qualitative  filter  paper. 

Lignin  and  standard  sample  (Kraft  Lignin  distributed  by  Sigma-Aldrich)  were  characterized  by  elemental  analysis 
(%C,  H,  N,  S,  O)  with  the  FLASH  2000  Series  CHNSO  Automatic  Elemental  Analyzer  of  Thermo-scientific,  by  UV 
spectroscopy  with  UV-VISIBLE  Perkin  Elmer  35  Digital  with  rank  between  200-400nm  equipment  using  a concentration 
of  0,016  mg/mL,  by  IR  spectroscopy  with  IR  spectrophotometer  with  Shimadzu  IR  Affinity  -1  Fourier  Transformed  and 
finally  by  solubility  (1  mg:  6 ml)  using  these  solvents:  NaOH  15%,  H20,  HC1  0.1  N,  HC1  32%,  Acetone,  Isopropanol, 
Butanol,  Allyl  alcohol.  Ethanol,  Methanol,  Ethyl  acetate.  Butyl  acetate,  THF  and  Glycerin. 

Second  Stage 

Second  stage  was  the  lignin  depolymerization  by  UV  irradiation,  and  its  hydroxymethylation  with  formaldehyde. 

1 g of  extracted  lignin  was  deposited  in  each  of  5 Petri  Dish.  Every  dish  was  irradiated  by  UV  for  10,  12,  14,  16  and  18  h 
respectively,  using  a 15  W TUV15  Germicidal  Philips  lamp  with  ozone  filter.  Depolymerized  samples  were  immediately 
hydroximethylated  with  formaldehyde  using  El  Mansouri  Method  (2006),  changing  agitation  to  10  h.  Product  was  then 
dried  to  50  °C  until  a solid  lignin  was  obtained.  By  elemental  analysis  (%  C,  H,  N,  S,  O)  was  determined  which  sample 
coupled  more  oxygen  amount.  Later,  depolymerization  by  12h  irradiation  and  hydroxymethylation  was  repeated  with  5 g 
of  extracted  lignin.  Results  were  demonstrated  by  IR  spectroscopy. 

Third  Stage 

Third  stage  was  the  elaboration  of  synthetic  wood. 

3 g of  depolymerized  and  hydroximethylated  lignin  was  mixed  with  3g  of  sawdust  and  6 g of  melamine.  Lately, 
mixture  was  heated  to  120  °C  and  7 ml  of  formaldehyde  37  % were  added  with  constant  stirring  until  a viscous  paste  was 
obtained.  Paste  was  deposited  inside  of  2 mold  and  each  one  was  compressed.  The  first  one  was  dried  for  24  h and  80  °C. 
The  second  was  autoclaved  to  15  psi  and  121  °C  for  3.5  h. 

RESULTS  AND  ANALYSIS 

First  Stage 

3 coal  samples  were  characterized  in  order  to  know  which  one  was  a low  rank  coal.  Table  1 shows  results.  Sample 
3 was  chosen  because  it  had  higher  percentage  of  H,  O,  volatile  matter  and  lower  percentage  of  C and  combustion  heat.

In  order  to  get  free  impurity  lignin  extract,  humic  acids  extraction  must  be  done  before.  Since  the  lowest  rank  coal 
is  sample  3,  236.22  g were  taken  to  extract  HA.  HA  extraction  is  made  by  their  solubility  in  weak  alkaline  solution.  Coal 
residue  containing  lignocellulosic  extract  is  obtained  on  this  way.  A 14.26%  of  Humic  Acids  was  obtained. 

Lignin  extraction  is  made  by  its  solubility  in  strong  basic  medium.  This  process  was  made  in  high  pressure 
(autoclave)  in  order  to  facilitate  the  dissolution.  A lignocellulosic  liqueur  was  obtained  and  purified  by  acid  hydrolysis  with 
H2S04.  An  oxidation  of  oxygen  bridges  between  lignin  and  carbohydrates  happens. 


H2S04(i)  + Lig-0-Carbohydrate(s)  — > S02(g)  + Lig-OH,sl  + HO-Carbohydrate(ac)  (1) 

Carbohydrates  joined  to  lignin  are  cellulose,  hemicelluloses  and  starch.  By  acid  hydrolysis  they  become  sugars 
and  they  can  be  separated  easily  by  solubility  in  water.  Acid  medium  in  solution  helps  lignin  precipitation.  The  extracted 
lignin  obtained  was  28.02  % free  of  impurity. 

Respect  to  characterization  of  extracted  lignin  and  Standard  Kraft  lignin,  in  UV  analysis  peaks  were  found  on  227 
and  226  nm  for  standard.  In  IR  analysis,  results  are  shown  on  Table  2.

In  a solubility  analysis  for  the  two  different  samples,  similar  results  were  found  in  different  solvents.  These  results 
show  how  similar  functional  groups  are  in  every  sample.  It  was  found  that  Standard  Kraft  lignin  sample  was  more  polar 
due  to  incorporation  of  SO3  coming  from  Na2S  that  was  used  as  solvent  in  extraction  process. 

Finally,  elemental  analysis  proved  that  both  samples  had  similar  composition.  On  Table  3,  results  show  that  % of 
S and  O from  standard  lignin  are  greater  than  % of  S and  O from  experimental  sample  proving  former  hypothesis.

Second  Stage 

For  synthetic  wood  elaboration,  extracted  lignin  must  be  coupled  with  synthetic  resin  and  a natural  fiber.  Since 
extracted  lignin  is  not  very  reactive,  it  is  necessary  to  modified  it  structurally.  In  order  to  get  it,  its  tridimensional  structure 
must  be  fragmented  so  is  possible  to  get  more  interaction  points  between  lignin  and  synthetic  resin.  On  this  stage,  process 
is  made  by  UV  irradiation. 

Lignin  depolymerization  obtained  by  UV  irradiation,  generate  on  its  structure  free  radicals  due  to  homolytic 
rupture  among  their  phenylpropanoids  unions.  Lignin  irradiation  time  is  proportional  to  produced  fragments.  The  key  is  to 
find  the  exposition  right  time  to  produce  lignin  with  enough  depolymerization  degree  in  order  to  increase  its  reactivity. 
Gordillo  and  Vega  (2010)  analyzed  the  reactivity  increase  with  different  exposition  time  to  15  watts  UV  beam 
(6,  12,  24,  36,  48  and  60  hours).  Right  time  was  found  at  12  hours.  10,  12,  14,  16  and  18  hours  were  worked  in  this  project. 

Generation  of  high  reactivity  points  due  to  lignin  fragmentation  let  lignin  to  get  more  functional  groups  on  its 
molecular  structure  so  it  becomes  more  reactive,  then,  when  lignin  reacts  with  synthetic  resin  more  union  points  can  be 
generated  and  a better  coupling  and  compaction  process  can  be  made.  One  of  lignin  structural  modifications  that  let  to 
increase  its  reactivity  is  the  hydroxymethylation  with  formaldehyde  (El  Mansouri,  2006).  Marton  et  al.  (1963)  have  found 
that  for  this  modification  the  presumable  reaction  is  the  Lederer-Manasse’s,  where  hydroxymethyl  groups  are  introduced 
on  active  position  of  aromatic  ring.  These  groups  help  polymerization  reactions  due  to  methylenic  bridges  formation 
between  lignin  and  synthetic  resin.  By  means  of  this  reaction,  oxygen  is  bonded  with  high  reactivity  points  generated  by 
depolymerization.  It  lets  quantify  the  oxygen  increment  in  lignin  by  elemental  analysis.  Mixture  that  shows  more  coupled 
oxygen  will  be  the  one  with  optimal  UV  irradiation  time.  Hydroxymethylation  reaction  must  be  performed  immediately 
after  depolymerization  with  UV  since  lignin  fragments  react  spontaneously.  It  decreases  the  amount  of  generated  reactive 
sites  as  the  amount  of  hydroxymethyl  groups  that  could  be  incorporated  generating  a less  reactive  lignin.  Lignin  sample 
that  had  more  oxygen  coupling  was  the  exposed  by  12  hours  to  UV  beam  (table  4).  It  was  noted  that  oxygen  increase 
relation  with  to  unmodified  lignin  (table  3)  was  32.1  %.

Increase  of  characteristic  bands  of  OH  groups  on  depolymerized  lignin  by  12  hours  with  UV  was  proved  by  IR 

analysis. 

Third  Stage 

Gordillo  and  Vega  (2010)  found  that  melamine-formaldehyde  presented  better  mechanical  properties.  It  due  to 
melamine  has  three  amine  groups  that  are  easily  condensable.  That  is  the  reason  because  this  project  was  worked  with  this 
resin  so  it  was  possible  to  coupled  with  modified  lignin. 

Modified  lignin  hydroxymethyl  groups  are  condensed  with  melamine  amine  groups  releasing  water  and  creating 
methylenic  bridges  that  give  compaction  to  final  product.  On  this  reaction  rice  husk  works  as  junction  agent  due  to  possess 
a great  amount  of  siloxanes  that  improve  interaction  between  lignin  and  resin  improving  mechanical  properties  of  final 
product. 


Final  products  are  shown  on  figure  1.  Obtained  product  by  autoclave  process  (figure,  lb)  shows  a better 
mechanical  resistance,  better  cohesion,  great  impermeability,  less  fragility  and  better  organoleptic  properties.

CONCLUSIONS 

Extracted  and  purified  lignin  shared  structural  features  with  Kraft  Lignin  standard  sample  except  for  SO3  groups. 

Optimal  depolymerization  time  for  lignin  irradiation  was  12  hours.  With  this  sample,  we  obtained  an  increase  of  reactivity 
of  32.1%  after  hydroxymethylation. 

Autoclaving  process  in  the  polymerization  reaction  generated  an  improvement  in  the  mechanical  properties  of  the 
wood  product  as  well  as  reducing  the  reaction  time.
