How  forecasts  are  made 

Most  of  the  annual  streamflow  in  the  Western  United  States  originates  as  snowfall  that  has 
accumulated  high  in  the  mountains  during  winter  and  early  spring.  As  the  snowpack 
accumulates,  hydrologists  estimate  the  runoff  that  will  occur  when  it  melts.  Predictions  are 
based  on  careful  measurements  of  snow  water  equivalent  at  selected  index  points. 

Precipitation,  temperature,  soil  moisture  and  antecedent  streamflow  data  are  combined  with 
snowpack  data  to  prepare  runoff  forecasts.  Streamflow  forecasts  are  coordinated  by  Soil 
Conservation  Service  and  National  Weather  Service  hydrologists.  This  report  presents  a 
comprehensive  picture  of  water  supply  conditions  for  areas  dependent  upon  surface  runoff.  It 
includes  selected  streamflow  forecasts,  summarized  snowpack  and  precipitation  data,  reservoir ' 
storage  data,  and  narratives  describing  current  conditions. 

, >e..  f 

Snowpack  data  are  obtained  by  using  a combination  of  manual  and  automated  SNOTEL 

measurement  methods.  Manual  readings  of  snow  depth  and  water  equivalent  are  taken  at 
locations  called  snow  courses  on  a monthly  or  semi-monthly  schedule  during  the  winter.  In 
addition,  snow  water  equivalent,  precipitation  and  temperature  are  monitored  on  a daily  basis 
and  transmitted  via  meteor  burst  telemetry  to  central  data  collection  facilities.  Both  monthly  and 
daily  data  are  used  to  project  snowmelt  runoff. 

Forecast  uncertainty  originates  from  two  sources:  (1)  uncertainty  of  future  hydrologic  and 
climatic  conditions,  and  (2)  error  in  the  forecasting  procedure.  To  express  the  uncertainty  in  the 
most  probable  forecast,  four  additional  forecasts  are  provided.  The  actual  streamflow  can  be 
expected  to  exceed  the  most  probable  forecast  50%  of  the  time.  Similarly,  the  actual  streamflow 
volume  can  be  expected  to  exceed  the  90%  forecast  volume  90%  of  the  time.  The  same  is  true 
for  the  70%,  30%,  and  10%  forecasts.  Generally,  the  90%  and  70%  forecasts  reflect  drier  than 
normal  hydrologic  and  climatic  conditions;  the  30%  and  10%  forecasts  reflect  wetter  than  normal 
conditions.  As  the  forecast  season  progresses,  a greater  portion  of  the  future  hydrologic  and 
climatic  uncertainty  will  become  known  and  the  additional  forecasts  will  move  closer  to  the  most 
probable  forecast.

Washington 
Water  Supply  Outlook 

JUNE  1994 


General  Outlook 

Forecasts  for  1994  runoff  vary  from  91%  of  average  for  Thunder  Creek 
near  Newhalem  to  42%  for  the  Spokane  River  near  Post  Falls.  As  of 
June  1,  the  snowpack  varied  from  a high  of  57%  of  average  in  the 
Cowlitz  - Lewis  River  Basin  to  0%  in  many  basins  state  wide. 

Washington  SNOTEL  sites  averaged  38%  of  the  normal  snowpack,  down  from 
70%  on  May  1.  May  precipitation  was  92%  of  normal  statewide.  It 
varied  from  159%  of  average  in  the  Walla  Walla  River  Basin  to  56%  in 
the  Wenatchee  - Chelan  River  Basins.  Year-to-date  precipitation 
varies  from  66%  in  the  Spokane  and  Yakima  Basins  to  83%  in  the  Olympic 
Basin.  May  temperatures  were  two  to  five  degrees  above  normal  across 
the  state.  May  streamflows  varied  from  107%  of  normal  in  the  Columbia 
at  Birchbank  to  37%  in  the  Yakima  River  at  Kiona.  June  1 reservoir 
storage  continued  seasonal  fluctuations  throughout  the  state,  with 
highs  of  160%  of  average  in  the  Colville  - Pend  Oreille  system  to  a 
low  of  70%  of  normal  in  the  Yakima  Basin. 


Snowpack 

By  June  1,  only  13  higher  elevation  SNOTEL  sites  had  snow.  Only  a few 
sites  in  the  state  normaly  are  melted  out  at  this  time.  Maximum  snow 
cover  was  at  Paradise  SNOTEL  near  Mount  Rainier,  with  a water  content 
of  43.6  inches.  Normal  June  1 water  content  for  this  site  would  be 
48.1  inches.  The  June  1 SNOTEL  reading  showed  the  statewide  snowpack 
to  be  38%  of  average.  Snowpack  varied  considerably  over  the  state, 
with  the  Spokane,  Walla  Walla  and  Olympic  river  basins  at  0%  to  a high 
of  57%  of  normal  in  the  Lewis  - Cowlitz  River  Basin.  The  Olympics 
droped  from  a May  1 statewide  high  of  91%  to  0%  of  average  on  June  1. 
Other  Westside  snowpack  averages  were:  the  Skagit  River  Basin  with 
30%,  the  Snohomish  River  basin  at  12%  and  the  White  River  at  38%  of 
average.  Snowpack  along  the  east  slopes  of  the  Cascade  Mountains 
included  the  Yakima  Basin  with  25%  of  normal,  and  the  Wenatchee  with 
32%.  Snowpack  in  the  Okanogan  Basin  was  at  50%  of  normal,  and  the 
Kettle  had  7%. 


Precipitation 

May  precipitation  varied  from  193%  of  average  in  the  Okanogan  - Methow 
River  Basins,  to  71%  in  the  Yakima  Basin.  May  precipitation  reported 
from  National  Weather  Service  stations  was  92%  of  average  statewide. 
The  year-to-date  precipitation  statewide  is  71%.  It  varies  from  66% 
of  normal  in  the  Spokane  and  Yakima  Basins,  to  83%  in  the  Olympic 
Basin.  SNOTEL  sites  in  Washington  showed  high  elevation  year-to-date 
precipitation  values  to  be  78%  of  average.  Maximum  year-to-date 
precipitation  was  at  the  June  Lake  SNOTEL  site  near  Mt.  St.  Helens, 
with  119  inches  since  October  1,  1993. 


Reservoir 


With  increased  snow  melt  and  runoff  due  to  warmer  temperatures,  some 
reservoir  levels  in  the  state  continued  to  rise.  In  contrast  other 
reservoirs  are  beginning  to  decrease,  this  can  be  attributed  to  many 
factors  like  irrigation  draw  down  and  early  snow  melt  combined  with 
evaporation.  Reservoir  storage  in  the  Yakima  Basin  was  655,600  acre 
feet,  70%  of  normal,  up  from  66%  a month  ago.  Storage  at  other 
reservoirs  included  Roosevelt  at  159%  of  average,  and  the  Okanogan 
reservoirs  at  130%  of  normal  for  June  1.  The  power  generation 
reservoirs  included  the  following:  Coeur  d'Alene  Lake,  230,500  acre 
feet,  or  82%  of  normal;  Chelan  Lake,  492,700  acre  feet,  109%  of 
average  and  73%  of  capacity,  and  Ross  Lake  at  115%  of  average  and  84% 
of  capacity. 


Streamflow 

May  streamflows  varied  greatly  in  Washington.  Columbia  River  at 
Birchbank  was  the  highest  at  107%  of  normal,  the  Yakima  River  at  Kiona 
with  37%  of  normal,  was  still  the  lowest  in  the  state.  Other 
streamflows  were  the  following  percentage  of  normal:  the  Cowlitz 
River,  66%;  the  Okanogan  River,  90%;  the  Wenatchee  River,  91%;  the 
Columbia  at  The  Dalles,  Oregon,  79%,  and  the  Spokane  River,  39%. 
Forecasts  for  summer  streamflows  are  for  below  to  much  below  average. 
They  vary  from  91%  of  average  for  Thunder  Creek  near  Newhalem  to  42% 
of  normal  for  the  Spokane  River  near  Post  Falls.  June  forecasts  for 
some  Westside  streams  include:  Cedar  River,  52%;  Green  River,  58%;  and 
the  Dungeness  River,  73%.  Some  eastside  streams  include  the  Grande 
Ronde  River,  70%;  the  Wenatchee  River,  54%;  and  the  Pend  Oreille 
River,  50%.  Salmon  Creek  near  Conconully  is  forecast  to  have  73%  of 
normal  runoff  and  the  Yakima  near  Parker  63%.

Interpreting  Streamflow  Forecasts 


Hchln!h0nfive  forecasts  are  issued  for  each  forecast  point  and  each  forecast  period.  Unless  othe™ise 
snecified.  all  streamflow  forecasts  are  for  streamflow  volumes  that  would  occur  naturally  without  any  upsoeam 
influences  Water  users  need  to  know  what  the  different  forecasts  represent  if  they  are  to  use  the  information 
c"  when taking  operational  decisions.  The  following  is  an  explanation  of  each  of  the  forecasts. 

Most  Probable  (50  Percent  Chance  of  Exceed)  Forecast.  This  forecast  is  tire  best  estimate  of  sneamflow 
i ,hat  K.  nroduced  given  current  conditions  and  based  on  the  outcome  of  similar  past  sttuaoons. 
" 50^n^rt  tiie  streamflow  volume  will  exceed  this  forecast  value.  There  , a 50  percent 

chance  that  the  streamflow  volume  will  be  less  than  this  forecast  value. 

" r0s,  probable  forecast  will  rarely  be  exactly  right,  due  to  errors  resulting  from  future  weather  conchnons 
and  the  forecast  equation  itself.  This  does  not  mean  that  users  should  not  use  the  most  probable  forecast,  i 
means  that  they  Sed  to  evaluate  existing  circumstances  and  determine  the  amount  of  nsk  they  are  writing 
take  by  accepting  this  forecast  value.

If  users  want  to  make  sure  there  is  enough  water  available  for  their  operations,  they  might  determine  that  a 50 
percent  chance  of  the  streamflow  volume  being  lower  than  the  most  probable  forecast  rs  too  much  nsk  to  take. 
Tb  reduce  the  risk  of  not  having  enough  water  available  during  the  forecast  penod,  users  can  base  their 
operational  decisions  on  one  of  the  forecasts  with  a greater  chance  of  being  exceeded  (or  possibly  some  point

If  users  want  to  make  sure  they  don’t  have  too  much  water,  they  might  determine  that  a 50  percent xhan« i of 
streamflow  being  higher  than  the  most  probable  forecast  is  too  much  of  a nsk  to  take.  To  reduce  the  nsk  of 
having  too  much  water  available  during  the  forecast  period,  users  can  base  their  operational  decisions  on  one  o 

the  forecasts  with  a smaller  chance  of  being  exceeded.  These  include:  , 

30  Percent  Chance  of  Exceeding  Forecast  There  is  a 30  percent  chance  that  the  streamflow  volume 
will  exceed  this  forecast  value.  There  is  a 70  percent  chance  the  streamflow  volume  will  be  less  than  th

will  exceed  this  forecast  value.  There  is  a 90  percent  chance  the  streamflow  volume  will  be  less  than  tins 

forecast  value.

Using  the  forecasts — an  example 

Using  the  Most  Probable  Forecast,  Using  the  example  forecasts  shown  below,  users  can  reasonably  expect 
36,000  acre-feet  to  flow  past  the  gaging  station  on  the  Maiy’s  River  near  Deeth  between  March  1 and  July  31. 

Using  the  Higher  Exceedance  Forecasts.  If  users  anticipate  a somewhat  drier  trend  in  the  future  (monthly  and 
seasonal  weather  oudooks  arc  available  from  the  National  Weather  Service  every  two  weeks),  or  if  they  are 
operating  at  a level  where  an  unexpected  shortage  of  water  could  cause  problems,  they  might  want  to  plan  on 
receiving  only  20,000  acre-feet  (from  the  70  percent  chance  of  exceeding  forecast).  In  seven  out  of  ten  years 
with  similar  conditions,  streamflow  volumes  will  exceed  the  20,000  acre-foot  forecast 

If  users  anticipate  extremely  dry  conditions  for  the  remainder  of  the  season,  or  if  they  determine  the  risk  of 
using  the  70  percent  chance  of  exceeding  forecast  is  too  great,  then  they  might  plan  on  receiving  only  5000 
acre-feet  (from  the  90  percent  chance  of  exceeding  forecast).  Nine  out  of  ten  years  with  similar  conditions, 
streamflow  volumes  will  exceed  the  5000  acre-foot  forecast 

Using  the  Lower  Exceedance  Forecasts.  If  users  expect  wetter  future  conditions,  or  if  the  chance  that  five  out 
of  every  ten  years  with  similar  conditions  would  produce  streamflow  volumes  greater  than  36,000  acre-feet  was 
more  than  they  would  like  to  risk,  they  might  plan  on  receiving  52,000  acre-feet  (from  the  30  percent  chance  of 
exceeding  forecast)  to  minimize  potential  flooding  problems.  Three  out  of  ten  years  with  similar  conditions, 
stream  flows  will  exceed  the  52,000  acre-foot  forecast. 

In  years  when  users  expect  extremely  wet  conditions  for  the  remainder  of  the  season  and  the  threat  of  severe 
flooding  and  downstream  damage  exists,  they  might  choose  to  use  the  76,000  acre-foot  (10  percent  chance  of 
exceeding)  forecast  for  their  water  management  operations.  Streamflow  volumes  will  exceed  this  level  only  one 

year  out  of  ten.
