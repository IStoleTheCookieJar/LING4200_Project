Lightning  Detection  and 
Data  Use  in  the  United  States 

Brenda  L.  Graham,  Ronald  L.  Holle,  and  Raul  E.  Lopez 


Each  year,  lightning  ignites 
about  10,000  wildland  fires  in 
the  United  States  (DeCoursey 
et  al.  1983).  Wildland  fire  manag¬ 
ers  in  the  11  Western  States  and 
Alaska  have  routinely  used  near- 
real-time  lightning  detection  net¬ 
work  data  to  determine  likely  areas 
for  new  ignitions.  Few  of  them, 
however,  have  had  training  in  the 
sensor  technology,  location  accu¬ 
racy,  and  detection  efficiency  of 
these  lightning  detection  net¬ 
works.  The  intent  of  this  article  is 
to  provide  background  in  these 
areas  so  fire  managers  can  make 
full  use  of  this  technology. 

Lightning  Itself 

There  are  two  types  of  lightning: 

•  Cloud-to-Ground  (CG)  flashes 
and 

•  Cloud  discharges. 

The  following  brief  description  is 
limited  to  CG  lightning  since  it  is 
the  type  that  initiates  wildland 
fires. 

A  CG  lightning  flash  (commonly 
called  a  “strike”  in  the  wildland  fire 
community)  is  composed  of  a  se¬ 
ries  of  events  that  occur  very 
quickly.  These  events  are  roughly 
as  follows: 


Brenda  Graham  is  a  fire  weather  meteo¬ 
rologist  for  the  U.S.  Department  of 
Commerce,  National  Oceanographic  and 
Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA), 
National  Weather  Sendee,  Medford ,  OR; 
Ronald  Holle  and  Raul  Lopez  are  research 
meteorologists  for  NOAA’s  National  Severe 
Storms  Laboratory,  Norman,  OK. 


Present  lightning  detection  networks  provide  fire 
managers  in  the  United  States  with  information 
about  potential  lightning-caused  wildfires. 
Lightning  location  information  can  also  be  used 
for  other  purposes  such  as  planning  for 
prescribed  natural  fire. 


1)  A  thunderstorm  cloud  (cumu¬ 
lonimbus)  becomes  predomi¬ 
nately  positively  charged  at  the 
top  and  negatively  charged  in 
the  lower  part  (Uman  1969). 

2)  A  typical  CG  lightning  flash  be¬ 
gins  as  a  “step  leader”  that 
“jumps”  about  150  feet  (50  m)  at 
a  time  toward  the  ground  from 
the  negatively  charged  region  at 
the  bottom  of  the  cloud  (fig.  1). 

3)  The  step  leader  travels  very 
quickly  and  takes  about  20  mil¬ 
liseconds  to  travel  about  2  miles 
(3  km)  (Uman  1969). 


4)  As  the  negatively  charged  step 
leader  approaches  the  ground, 
positively  charged  “streamers” 
respond  by  traveling  skyward  to¬ 
ward  the  step  leader.  Streamers 
typically  move  up  from  the  tall¬ 
est  well-grounded  object  like  a 
tree  or  building  (fig.  1). 

5)  WTien  the  step  leader  and  a 
streamer  meet  about  150  to  300 
feet  (50  to  100  m)  above  ground, 
they  form  an  electrical  channel 
that  is  about  as  wide  as  your 
thumb.

6)  A  series  of  electrical  current 
surges  called  return  strokes  fol¬ 
lows.  Two  to  four  return  strokes, 
which  have  the  net  effect  of  low¬ 
ering  negative  charge  to  the 
ground,  comprise  a  typical  light¬ 
ning  flash  (Uman  1969).  This  is 
the  origin  of  the  term  “negative 
lightning,”  which  is  the  most 
common  type  of  CG  lightning. 
“Positive  lightning”  occurs  when 
a  positive  charge  is  lowered  to 
the  ground  (about  5  to  10  per¬ 
cent  of  CG  flashes  are  positive). 
Figure  2  shows  a  common  form 
of  damage  when  lightning  strikes 
a  tree. 

Figure  3  shows  three  CG  flashes 
photographed  in  about  1  second  by 
moving  the  camera  from  left  to 
right.  The  first  return  strokes  of 
the  two  main  flashes  are  to  the  left; 
they  have  several  branches.  The  left 
flash  has  seven  return  strokes  with 
a  single-stroke  flash  just  to  its 
right.  The  flash  on  the  right  has  six 
return  strokes.

Lightning  is  tremendously  ener¬ 
getic.  The  typical  CG  lightning 
flash  carries  a  peak  current  of 
30,000  amperes.  In  comparison, 
most  household  circuits  in  the 
United  States  carry  15  amperes, 
and  a  100-watt  light  bulb  uses 
about  1  amp  (Uman  1971).  In  a 
fraction  of  a  second,  the  air  imme¬ 
diately  around  the  lightning  chan¬ 
nel  is  super-heated  to  15,000  to 
60,000  °F  (8,000  to  33,000  °C), 
which  is  much  hotter  than  the 
sun’s  surface  (Uman  1969).  This 
rapid  heating  creates  the  shock 
wave  we  hear  as  thunder. 

Most  CG  lightning  flashes  in  wild¬ 
land  areas  do  not  create  new  fires 
because  the  fuels  are  not  exposed 
to  high  temperatures  long  enough 
for  combustion  to  begin.  However, 
when  wildland  fuels  become  very 
dry  due  to  some  environmental 
condition  such  as  prolonged 
drought,  the  likelihood  of  ignition 
increases. 

Technologies  Used  in 
Lightning  Detectors 

CG  lightning  flashes  produce 
uniquely  shaped  electromagnetic 


waves  that  can  travel  great  dis¬ 
tances.  Lightning  detection  net¬ 
works  are  designed  to  use  this 
information. 

Lightning  detection  sensors  in  the 
United  States  use  “direction-find¬ 
ing”  (DF)  or  “time-of-arrival” 

(TOA)  technologies.  The  perfor¬ 
mance  of  a  lightning  detection  net¬ 
work  is  affected  by  the  character  of 
its  sensor  technology. 

DF  Technology.  Based  on  tradi¬ 
tional  radio  direction-finding  tech¬ 
niques,  DF  technology  sensors 
have  two  loop-shaped  antennas 
perpendicular  to  each  other.  A 
lightning  flash’s  magnetic  field  in¬ 
duces  signals  in  both  loops  that  are 
determined  by  factors  such  as  the 
flash’s  current  flow  and  the  orien¬ 
tation  of  the  lightning  channel  to 
the  antennas.  When  the  radio  sig¬ 
nal  produced  by  a  lightning  flash 
arrives  at  the  antenna,  onsite  soft¬ 
ware  immediately  compares  the 
ratio  of  signals  in  the  loops  to 
identify  the  flash’s  azimuth.  All  azi¬ 
muths  from  all  sensors  are  sent  to

a  central  processor  that  uses  azi¬ 
muths  from  two  or  more  sensor 
sites  (triangulation)  to  identify  the 
probable  area  of  flash  location  (fig. 
4)  (Holle  and  Lopez  1993). 

TOA  Technology.  TOA  technology 
involves  an  evaluation  of  when  the 
electric  pulse  generated  by  a  re¬ 
turn  stroke  arrives  at  multiple  re¬ 
ceivers.  To  determine  location,  the 
electric  pulse  arrival  time  at  each 
receiver  site  is  sent  to  a  central 
analyzer  that  computes  the  differ¬ 
ence  in  arrival  times  between  pairs 
of  receivers.  A  plot  of  all  the  points 
between  a  pair  of  receivers  where 
that  time  difference  is  possible  de¬ 
fines  a  hyperbola  (fig.  5).  Compari¬ 
sons  between  four  to  six  sensors 
provide  the  optimum  location  of 
the  flash.  Figure  5  shows  a  prob¬ 
able  flash  location  defined  by  the 
intersection  of  the  hyperbolas  from 
two  receiver  pairs.  These  receivers 
must  be  synchronized  to  the  same 
dependable  time  source  for  this 
system  to  work  (Holle  and  Lopez 
1993). 

Waveform  Discrimination.  The 

electromagnetic  waves  sent  out  by 
lightning  flashes  have  particular 
forms  that  sensors  can  resolve  (fig. 
6).  The  sensors  perform  onsite 
comparisons  of  detected  flash 
waveforms  with  a  statistically  de¬ 
termined  lightning  waveform  ob¬ 
tained  from  previous  studies  of  CG 
flashes.  If  the  comparison  is  a  close 
match,  the  data  are  accepted  and 
sent  to  the  network  processor.  This 
waveform  discrimination  helps 
keep  spurious  noise  and  cloud 
flash  signals  from  being  reported. 

Figure  6a  shows  some  of  the  key 
features  of  CG  lightning  flashes: 

•  The  (step)  leader  pulse  prior  to 
discharge, 

•  Shape  of  rise-time  portion  of  the 
wave,  and 


•  Width  between  peak  amplitude 
and  when  the  signal  drops  to  an 
established  threshold. 

Figure  6b  shows  some  signals  from 
negative  CG  discharges.  Note  these 
waves  have  the  same  features  as 
the  one  in  6a,  only  they  are  in¬ 
verted  because  they  are  from  nega¬ 
tive  flashes.  Figure  6c  shows  cloud 
discharges,  and  they  lack  the  same 
defining  features. 


Networks  in  the 
United  States 

The  BLM  Network.  From  1976 
through  1996,  fire  managers  in  the 
11  Western  States  and  Alaska  re¬ 
ceived  CG  lightning  data  from  the 
U.S.  Department  of  the  Interior’s 
Bureau  of  Land  Management 
(BLM)  networks.  These  networks 
used  DF  technology.  CG  lightning 
data  were  distributed  to  wildland 
fire  managers  in  near  real  time  via

the  BLM  IAMS  computer  network. 
Beginning  in  1997,  the  CG  flash 
data  in  the  48  contiguous  States 
will  come  from  the  National  Light¬ 
ning  Detection  Network  (NLDN), 
but  the  Alaska  network  will  remain 
the  same  for  at  least  several  more 
years.  This  change  in  data  source 
will  be  transparent  to  fire  manag¬ 
ers  in  the  11  Western  States  be¬ 
cause  data  distribution  will 
continue  through  the  existing 
IAMS  system.

established  a  few  years  ago  in  the 
48  contiguous  States;  a  private  cor¬

The  network  is  composed  of  a  mix¬

TOA  only  and  some  with  DF  and 
TOA  together.  The  sensors  with 
combined  DF  and  TOA  technology

processor  that  resolves  all  the  in¬ 
formation  into  individual  CG 
flashes  and  locations.  GAI  gathers, 
processes,  and  archives  all  the 
data. 

Network  Performance 

DF  sensors  are  subject  to  errors 
caused  by  topography  and  human- 
made  structures  near  the  site.  Lo¬ 
cal  terrain  and  buildings  can 
reflect,  absorb,  and  reradiate  sig¬ 
nals.  However,  once  each  site’s  er¬ 
rors  are  documented,  they  are 
corrected  during  data  processing 
to  minimize  potential  inaccura¬ 
cies. 

Network  detection  efficiency  (per¬ 
centage  of  actual  CG  flashes  re¬ 
ported)  is  a  function  of  sensor 
layout  and  where  the  CG  flashes 
occur  relative  to  the  sensors.  In 
some  cases,  CG  flashes  remain  un¬ 
reported  because  their  signals  are 
too  weak  to  be  received  by  enough 
sensors  for  calculating  a  location. 

A  CG  signal  that  passes  the  wave¬ 
form  compatibility  test  can  still  be 
discarded  if  it  does  not  achieve  a 
minimum  signal  strength  thresh¬ 
old  value.  In  some  cases,  the  wave¬ 
form  itself  may  be  rejected  because 


it  does  not  fall  within  the  statisti¬ 
cal  CG  flash  profile. 

Location  accuracy  of  networks  also 
depends  on  sensor  layout  and 
where  the  CG  flashes  occur  relative 
to  the  sensors.  Location  accuracy 
with  networks  based  on  DF-only 
sensors  (like  the  BLM  networks) 
has  been  shown  to  vary  from  about 
.25  to  2.5  miles  (0.4  to  4  km).  GAI’s 
upgraded  NLDN  has  a  location  ac¬ 
curacy  of  .3  mile  (0.5  km)  due  to 
its  combined  use  of  DF  and  TOA 
technologies  that  allows  the  net¬ 
work  to  determine  flash  location 
more  accurately. 

The  BLM  network  detection  effi¬ 
ciency  has  been  around  60  to  70 
percent  and  possibly  as  low  as  40 
percent  in  some  areas.  Networks 
with  configurations  like  GAI’s  have 
a  higher  network  detection  effi¬ 
ciency  on  the  order  of  70  to  90  per¬ 
cent  (Holle  and  Lopez  1993).  Fire 
managers  in  the  11  Western  States 
will  probably  notice  about  40  per¬ 
cent  more  flashes  reported  by  the 
NLDN  compared  to  the  BLM  net¬ 
work  due  to  improvements  in  net¬ 
work  performance.  Reported 
flashes  could  be  even  greater  for 
some  areas. 


Which  Flashes 
Cause  Fires? 

About  30  percent  of  all  lightning 
flashes  are  cloud-to-ground 
(Krider  1994),  and  it  would  be 
ideal  to  know  which  are  most 
likely  to  ignite  a  fire.  Some  CG 
lightning  flashes  have  a  long  pe¬ 
riod  of  continuing  current  (fig.  9), 
meaning  that  the  current  is  slow 
to  decay  after  reaching  a  peak.  The 
“blur”  between  some  successive 
strokes  shown  in  figure  3  is  due  to 
continuing  current.  There  is  some 
evidence  that  long  continuing  cur¬ 
rent  (LCC)  flashes  are  more  likely 
to  start  fires  than  other  CG  flashes 
(Fuquay  1980).  An  LCC  flash 
would  expose  fuels  to  heat  longer, 
thus  increasing  the  chance  of  igni¬ 
tion  compared  to  an  equal  non- 
LCC  flash.  A  limited  set  of  data 
from  experiments  suggests  that 
positive  flashes  are  quite  likely  to 
have  LCC,  while  a  lower  percent¬ 
age  of  negative  flashes  have  LCC 
(table  1).  No  lightning  detection 
network  in  use  today  makes  any 
distinction  of  current  flow  dura¬ 
tion  in  CG  flashes.  GAI  is  conduct¬ 
ing  research  in  this  area,  however, 
and  expects  to  add  this  capability 
to  its  network  in  the  future. 

Lightning  Data  Use  by 
Wildland  Fire  Managers 

While  the  most  common  use  of 
lightning  detection  network  data 
by  wildland  fire  managers  involves 
near  real-time  data  applied  to  op¬ 
erations,  historical  data  are  also 
being  studied.  For  example,  the 
Fishlake  National  Forest  in  central 
Utah  is  using  historical  lightning 
data  to  evaluate  the  correlation  be¬ 
tween  lightning  and  ignition  oc¬ 
currences  over  a  given  area.  The 
patterns  that  emerge  from  the 
analysis  may  be  valuable  input  for 
deciding  which  areas  of  the  forest 
would  be  good  candidates  for  pre¬ 
scribed  natural  fire  (Chappell,  per-

ing  historical  data  to  develop  a 
lightning  climatology  (pattern)  for 
an  area,  it  is  important  to  use  the 
longest  record  possible.  Lightning

been  completed  for  several  West¬

data  were  available  solely  to  wild¬ 
land  fire  managers  in  the  Western 


United  States  and  Alaska  until 
recently.  Now  that  the  NLDN  is  in 
place,  CG  lightning  data  are  avail¬ 
able  in  all  wildland  areas  of  the  48 
contiguous  States.  The  combina¬ 
tion  of  DF  and  TOA  technology  in 
the  NLDN  has  improved  detection 
efficiency  and  location  accuracy. 
While  some  CG  lightning  flashes  in 
your  area  may  not  be  reported  by  a 
network,  this  situation  should  not 
have  a  significant  impact  on  the 
value  of  the  data.  Since  most  thun¬ 
derstorms  produce  several  CG 
lightning  flashes  per  minute, 


present  network  detection  efficien¬ 
cies  are  very  adequate  for  most 
wildland  fire  applications.

Safety  from  a 

Brenda  L.  Graham, 

Ronald  L.  Holle,  and 
Raul  E.  Lopez 

Everyone  who  works  outdoors 
should  be  aware  of  the  inherent 
threat  of  being  struck  by  light¬ 
ning.  On  average,  at  least  80 
people  are  killed  by  lightning 
and  about  five  times  as  many  are 
injured  each  year.  These  acci¬ 
dents  may  occur  due  to  people’s 
ignorance  of  how  dangerous 
lightning  is,  their  inability  to 
recognize  the  potential  threat 
from  lightning,  or  their  lack  of 
knowledge  about  lightning  safety 
rules.  By  heeding  the  following 
advice,  you  can  reduce  the 
chance  of  death  or  injury  when 
lightning  is  nearby. 

Before  Storms 
Develop 

•  Be  constantly  aware  of  how 
long  it  will  take  to  reach  safe 
shelter  if  a  thunderstorm 
occurs. 

•  Observe  when  new  thunder¬ 
storms  start  to  develop. 

•  Post  a  lookout  to  observe  and 
communicate  the  lightning 
threat. 

When  Thunderstorms 
Develop 

Estimate  your  distance  to  light¬ 
ning  using  the  flash-to-bang 


Lightning  Strike 

method:  Start  counting  seconds 
(one-thousand-one,  one-thousand- 
two,  etc.)  from  the  time  you  see 
the  flash  until  you  hear  the  thun¬ 
der.  Estimate  that  lightning  is  1 
mile  (1.6  km)  away  for  each  5  sec¬ 
onds  counted.  If  lightning  is  occur¬ 
ring  closer  than  5  miles  (8  km)  (or 
25  seconds  away),  go  to  a  safe  shel¬ 
ter  immediately,  if  possible.  Once 
lightning  is  within  5  miles,  the 
next  flash  may  occur  where  you 
are,  so  plan  to  reach  safe  shelter 
before  lightning  occurs  that  close. 

Lightning  Nearby 

When  outside  and  far  from  vehicles 
or  buildings,  seek  a  thick  grove  of 
small  trees  surrounded  by  tall 
trees.  Stay  away  from  individual 
trees. 

•  Don’t  stand  in  an  open  area 
more  than  100  yards  (91  m) 
across. 

•  Don’t  be  the  highest  object,  such 
as  on  a  ridge,  rock  outcropping, 
or  roof. 

•  Don’t  be  in  the  water  or  in  a 
boat. 

•  Don’t  be  near  or  in  contact  with 
anything  taller  than  its  sur¬ 
roundings  that  may  be  prone  to 
being  hit  by  lightning. 

•  Don’t  be  near  or  in  contact  with 
large  metallic  objects  such  as  an¬ 
tennas  or  metal  fences. 


The  best  option  is  to  go  inside  a 
public  building  or  a  residence. 
Metal-topped  buildings  with 
stone  or  other  nonconducting 
walls  are  not  safe.  Don’t  touch 
anything  connected  to  the  power 
and  phone  lines  or  plumbing 
pipes.  The  second  best  option  is 
to  go  inside  a  vehicle  with  a  solid 
metal  top,  but  don’t  touch  the 
sides  of  the  vehicle. 

Last  Minute 

If  you  are  caught  outside  with 
lightning  nearby  or  your  hair 
stands  on  end  and  none  of  the 
above  options  are  available: 

•  Crouch  on  the  balls  of  your 
feet  with  your  head  down,  and 
grasp  your  knees  with  your 
hands.  This  crouching  position 
minimizes  your  contact  with 
the  ground,  which  can  be 
quite  conductive,  especially  if 
wet. 

•  Don’t  lie  flat  on  the  ground  or 
touch  the  ground  with  your 
hands. 

•  If  in  a  group,  spread  out  so 
that  fewer  people  are  likely  to 
become  victims. 

When  Lightning 
Strikes 

Apply  CPR  to  anyone  rendered 
unconscious  by  lightning.  ■

Fire  Management  Notes 


Tracking  Thunderbolts: 
Technology  at  Work 

Phil  Sielaff 


The  technology  involved  in  the 
Automated  Lightning  Detec¬ 
tion  System  (ALDS)  has  been 
evolving  for  over  20  years.  The  sys¬ 
tem  currently  can  provide  informa¬ 
tion  on  lightning  “ground  strike” 
activity  to  land  managers  and  fire 
officials  in  real  time.  As  a  result  of 
these  two  decades  of  experimenta¬ 
tion,  others  around  the  world  are 
able  to  use  the  ALDS  to  help  them 
anticipate  natural  wildfire  occur¬ 
rence. 

Background  for 

Technology 

Development 

In  the  early  1970’s,  fire  managers 
regularly  asked  for  less  expensive 
and  safer  ways  of  detecting  light¬ 
ning  ground  strike  activity  com¬ 
pared  with  the  standard  practice  of 
flying  aircraft  behind  storms  to  vi¬ 
sually  track  lightning.  The  USDI’s 
Bureau  of  Land  Management  (BLM) 
responded  by  developing  a  pilot 
remote  system  to  track  lightning 
strikes  in  Alaska.  Since  then,  the 
BLM  has  extended  the  lightning 
detection  network  to  the  Western 
United  States.  (See  fig.  1  for  loca¬ 
tions  of  the  BLM’s  lightning  detec¬ 
tion  stations  in  the  West.) 

Working  with  the  University  of  Ari¬ 
zona,  Tucson,  AZ,  the  BLM’s  Office 
of  Scientific  Systems  Development 
in  Denver,  CO — jointly  with  the  Di¬ 
vision  of  Communications  Manage- 


Phil  Sielaff  is  the  leader  of  the  Remote 
Sensing  Support  Group  for  the  United 
States  Department  of  the  Interior,  Bureau 
of  Land  Management,  National  Inter¬ 
agency  Fire  Center,  Boise,  ID. 


For  over  20  years,  the 
Automated  Lightning 
Detection  System  (ALDS) 
has  been  evolving;  as 
new  technology  is 
developed,  the  system 
will  continue  to  improve 
in  the  future. 


ment  at  what  was  then  called  the 
Boise  Interagency  Fire  Center — 
developed  the  prototype  of  ALDS. 
The  initial  operations  in  Alaska 
demonstrated  that  ALDS — when 
used  in  conjunction  with  National 
Weather  Service  (NWS)  weather 
radar — could  achieve  significant 
savings  in  isolating  “active”  cells. 
(An  “active  cell”  is  one  that  is  pro¬ 
ducing  lightning  ground  strike 


activity.)  As  increased  experience 
and  detection  efficiencies  were  at¬ 
tained  in  Alaska,  the  NWS  began  to 
use  the  ALDS  to  supplement 
weather  radar  to  detect  thunder¬ 
storm  activity  at  long  distances 
(outside  of  weather  radar  range). 

Because  of  their  satisfactory  expe¬ 
riences  in  Alaska,  the  BLM  decided 
in  the  late  1970's  to  place  instru¬ 
ments  in  the  Western  United 
States  and  establish  the  first  opera¬ 
tional  ALDS  network. 

The  BLM  next  worked  with  a  new 
commercial  firm — Lightning 
Location  and  Protection  Inc. 

(LLP)’ — to  place  and  operate  the 
ALDS,  supplying  coverage  over 
roughly  95  percent  of  the  States 
located  west  of  the  Rocky  Moun¬ 
tains.

As  we  operated  the  early  system, 
many  other  interested  “observers” 
began  to  see  what  this  network 
could  do  operationally  in  real  time. 
Thus  the  NWS,  Federal  Aviation  Ad¬ 
ministration,  Department  of  De¬ 
fense,  Department  of  Energy,  and 
many  private  firms  began  to  moni¬ 
tor  our  efforts. 

Network  Products 

Having  the  right  information  in  a 
form  that  local  managers  can 
readily  use  for  real-time  fire  man¬ 
agement  was  the  BLM’s  primary 
goal  in  developing  ALDS.  For  ex¬ 
ample,  figure  2  illustrates  lightning 
strikes  for  2  hours  on  May  14,  1996, 
over  the  Western  United  States.  The 
local  fire  management  staffs  in 
these  “active”  areas  have  the  capa¬ 
bilities  at  their  respective  locations 
to  zoom  in  on  this  activity.  As  the 
local  user  begins  to  actively  use  the 
ALDS  information,  additional  fire 
management  information  is  added 
to  the  ALDS  plots  to  provide  a  com¬ 
posite  of  the  “big  picture”  at  the 
user’s  particular  location.  Because 
it  is  clear  in  figure  2  that  there  is  a 
great  deal  of  thunderstorm  activity 
near  the  Oregon  and  Idaho  border, 
local  fire  managers  would  actively 
process  all  available  data  to  imple¬ 
ment  action  plans  (e.g.,  move  to  an 
elevated  planning  level,  pre-posi¬ 
tion  pumper  crews,  dispatch  recon¬ 
naissance  crews). 

Figure  3  shows  how  the  BLM’s 
lightning  detection  system  can 
“zoom  in”  to  track  319  strikes  in 
Idaho  and  Oregon  during  7-1/2 
hours  on  May  14.  Note  that  positive 
lightning  strikes  are  shown  with 
red  zigzags  and  negative  strikes 
with  black  dashes. 


*The  use  of  corporation  names  and/or  their  products  is

should  not  be  misconstrued  as  an  official  endorsement

Service,  or  USDI  Bureau  of  Land  Management.

These  types  of  graphics  are  pro¬ 
duced  in  real  time  at  each  local 
BLM  user  site  that  has  lightning 
ground  strike  activity.  The  process 
begins  when  direction  finders 
(DF’s)  (electronic  sensors)  detect 
lightning  ground  strikes.  Every 
lightning  flash  generates  a  distinct 
signal  that  travels  outward  uni¬ 
formly  at  nearly  the  speed  of  light. 
(The  movement  of  this  signal  is 
similar  to  the  radiation  of  circles 
around  a  pebble  after  it  is  dropped 


in  still  water.)  Each  distinct  signal 
is  picked  up  by  the  DF’s,  which 
have  specially  designed  antennas 
and  electronics  to  measure  the  di¬ 
rection  to  the  ground  strike.  The 
DF’s  determine  the  direction  and 
transmit  that  and  other  informa¬ 
tion  such  as  strike  polarity  and  sig¬ 
nal  strength  to  a  Position  Analyzer 
(PA).  The  Position  Analyzer  (a 
computer-like  device)  performs 
numerous  mathematical  calcula¬ 
tions  to  process  incoming  DF  data,

Fire  Management  Notes 


triangulates  the  vectors,  validates 
the  information,  and  then  pin¬ 
points  the  exact  location  (latitude 
and  longitude  coordinates)  of  each 
lightning  ground  strike.  The  final 
processed  PA  information  is  auto¬ 
matically  sent  to  any  authorized 
field  user  who  wishes  to  access  it. 

Figure  4  illustrates  more  closely 
the  319  lightning  strikes  also 
shown  in  figure  3  and  shows 
boundaries  of  counties. 

Results  of 
Monitoring  Efforts 

As  a  result  of  observing  the  light¬ 
ning  locating  system  and  the  prod¬ 
ucts  derived  from  the  system,  LLP 
and  other  lightning  detection  com¬ 
panies  began  to  market  and  sell 
their  systems  to  other  government 
and  nongovernment  users.  These 
local  networks  proliferated  during 
the  early  and  mid-1980s.  The  Elec¬ 
trical  Power  Research  Institute,  in 
conjunction  with  the  State  Univer¬ 
sity  of  New  York  at  Albany,  began 
to  consolidate  all  of  these  indepen¬ 
dent  detection  networks  into  a  “na¬ 
tional”  system  to  supply  coverage 
throughout  the  conterminous 
United  States.  As  a  result  of  these 
and  other  efforts,  for  the  first  time 
at  the  beginning  of  1990,  lightning 
data  on  a  quasi-national  basis  were 
available  from  the  private  sector. 

Looking  to  the 
Private  Sector 

Because  of  recurring  costs  associ¬ 
ated  with  operating  a  large  ALDS 
network  and  the  prospect  of  having 
to  replace  older  ALDS  equipment, 
the  BLM  began  looking  to  the  pri¬ 
vate  sector  as  a  possible  alternate 
source  for  lightning  data.  In  1995, 
the  NWS,  working  through  the  Of¬ 
fice  of  the  Federal  Coordinator  for 
Meteorology,  took  the  lead  to  con¬ 
solidate  all  Federal  users  interested 
in  procuring  lightning  data.  As  a

lightning  strikes  on  May  14,  1996. 


result,  a  contract  was  awarded  to 
Global  Atmospherics,  Inc.  (GAI)  of 
Tucson,  AZ,  to  supply  national 
lightning  detection  information  for 
the  conterminous  United  States 
and  some  maritime  areas.  The  ser¬ 
vices  provided  under  this  5-year 
contract  will  provide  increased  ca¬ 
pabilities  for  the  BLM  and  many 
other  Federal  users.  Because  Alaska 
has  its  own  unique  requirements, 
GAI  cannot  supply  lightning  data 
for  that  State  at  this  time.  There¬ 
fore,  the  BLM  will  continue  to 
operate  its  own  ALDS  in  Alaska. 

Currently,  the  BLM  is  receiving  Na¬ 
tional  Lightning  Detection  Net¬ 
work  (NLDN)  data  at  our  National 
Interagency  Fire  Center  in  Boise, 
ID.  We  use  the  existing  Initial  At¬ 
tack  Management  System/Auto¬ 
matic  Lightning  Detection  System 
(IAMS/ALDS)  telecommunications 
network  to  distribute  NLDN  data  to 
the  BLM  real-time  user  community 
(up  to  70  file  server  locations).  Ne¬ 
gotiations  are  currently  underway 
with  other  USDI  fire  management 
staffs  to  see  how  they  will  attain 
data  under  this  new  contract  ar¬ 
rangement.  Under  current  contract 
provisions,  the  BLM  cannot  and 


will  not  redistribute  lightning  data 
to  other  Federal  or  State  users. 

The  only  exception  to  this  provi¬ 
sion  is  if  Federal  or  State  fire  of¬ 
fices  are  collocated  with  the  BLM. 
Those  cooperators  may  continue  to 
use  the  data  at  the  particular  field 
office  but  cannot  redistribute  or 
broadcast  the  information  beyond 
that  point.  (This  provision  can  be 
modified  if  the  collocated  Federal 
or  State  fire  office  attains  rights 
from  GAI  to  distribute  the  data  to 
its  user  community.) 

The  BLM’s  lightning  detection  ef¬ 
forts  will  continue  to  evolve  as 
improvements  in  technology  are 
found  and  implemented.  Com¬ 
pared  to  our  standard  fire  manage¬ 
ment  practices  of  just  20  years  ago, 
the  efforts  have  been  well  worth 
the  investment  in  time,  energy, 
and  money.

Current  Status  of  the  Wildland 
Fire  Assessment  System  (WFAS) 

Robert  E.  Burgan,  Patricia  L.  Andrews,  Larry  S.  Bradshaw, 
Carolyn  H.  Chase,  Roberta  A.  Hartford,  and  Don  J.  Latham 


The  Fire  Behavior  Research 
Work  Unit  (RWU)  of  the  Inter¬ 
mountain  Research  Station  has 
been  developing  the  Wildland  Fire 
Assessment  System  (WFAS)  since 
1994.  The  WFAS  will  eventually 
combine  the  functionality  of  the 
current  fire-danger  rating  system 
(Deeming  et  al.  1977)  and  the  fire 
behavior  system  (Andrews  1986). 
The  new  system  will  assess  fire  po¬ 
tential  across  spatial  scales  ranging 
from  national  to  site  specific  and 
time  scales  ranging  from  near-real¬ 
time  to  5-day  forecasts.  The  out¬ 
puts  will  be  useful  for  fire 
management  tasks  ranging  from 
strategic  planning  to  current  fire 
situation  analyses  (Burgan  and 
Bradshaw  1997). 

Traditionally,  the  terms  “fire  dan¬ 
ger”  and  “fire  behavior”  have  de¬ 
scribed  assessments  of  fire 
potential  on  different  time  and 
space  scales.  Fire  danger  has  been 
evaluated  routinely,  at  least  once  a 
day,  for  broad  areas.  Fire  behavior 
assessments,  however,  are  made  as 
needed  for  specific  sites.  Both  use 
weather  that  has  been  forecasted 
or  measured,  but  fire  danger — 
because  of  its  routine  and  regular 
computation — requires  regularly 
formatted  and  routinely  available 
data  for  automated  processing. 


Robert  Burgan  is  a  research  forester,  Pat 
Andrews  is  a  research  physical  scientist, 
Larry  Bradshaw  is  a  meteorologist, 
Carolyn  Chase  is  a  mathematician, 
Roberta  Hartford  is  a  forester,  and  Don 
Latham  is  a  research  meteorologist  for  the 
USDA  Forest  Service,  Intermountain 
Research  Station,  Fire  Behavior  Research 
Work  Unit,  Missoula,  MT. 


The  Wildland  Fire 
Assessment  System 
(WFAS)  will  use  the 
best  methodology 
available  to  provide  fire 
potential  assessments 
for  the  21  st  century. 

Fire  behavior  must  have  weather 
inputs  matched  as  closely  as  pos¬ 
sible  to  the  fire  site. 

Fire  danger  ratings  have  tradition¬ 
ally  been  relative  values  or  dimen¬ 
sionless  indexes,  whereas  fire 
behavior  assessments  are  specific, 
physical  descriptions  of  expected 
fire  characteristics  such  as  rate  of 
spread,  flame  length,  and  fire  inten¬ 
sity. 

As  we  have  been  developing  WFAS, 
our  goal  has  been  to  remove  the 
“seams”  that  exist  between  the 
current  systems  (Rothermel  and 
Andrews  1987).  For  instance,  our 
new  “seamless  system”  will  move 
easily  from  evaluating  fire  danger 
over  a  broad  area  to  assessing  fire 
behavior  at  a  specific  location. 

As  we  develop  WFAS,  we  will  con¬ 
tinue  to  resolve  incompatibilities 
such  as  different  sets  of  fuel  models 
and  equation  differences.  The 
WFAS  framework  will  address  the 
issue  of  weak  linkages  among  cur¬ 
rent  systems — fire  behavior,  fire 
danger,  fire  planning,  fire  effects, 
and  smoke  management — and  help 
resolve  the  confusion  that  exists  on 


proper  application  of  current  frag¬ 
mented  systems. 

The  fire  behavior  component  of  the 
WFAS  will  be  based  on  the  FARSITE 
Fire  Area  Simulator  (Finney  1995) 
and  will  not  be  discussed  here.  In¬ 
stead,  we  are  focusing  in  this  article 
on  broad  area  fire  assessment  of  the 
nature  typically  associated  with  fire 
danger  rating. 

Development  and 
Implementation  Plan 

We  are  using  a  three-phase  strategy 
to  develop  the  WFAS  and  have 
defined  the  products  and  processes 
that  will  become  available  to  clients 
once  each  stage  is  finished.  This  ap¬ 
proach  provides  a  natural  transition 
from  the  existing  piecemeal  sys¬ 
tems  to  a  new  integrated  system. 
This  development  and  implementa¬ 
tion  plan  is,  of  course,  dynamic. 
Based  on  user  feedback  and  on  the 
availability  of  new  technology  and 
research  products,  we  expect  the 
WFAS  to  change  during  develop¬ 
ment  stages.  The  three  phases  and 
the  planned  schedule  are  as  follows: 

•  Phase  1 — 1995  to  1996:  Spatial 
display  of  weather  and  current 
National  Fire-Danger  Rating 
System  (NFDRS)  values. 

•  Phase  2 — 1996  to  1997:  Improve¬ 
ments  to  NFDRS  calculations. 

•  Phase  3 — 1998:  Major  fuel  and 
fire  modeling  updates  and 
gridded  weather  models. 

Phase  1.  In  the  completed  phase  1, 
we  enhanced  the  current  fire-dan¬ 
ger  rating  system  with  spatial  dis-

plays.  Fire  danger  and  weather  data 
are  obtained  from  the  Weather  In¬ 
formation  Management  System 
(WIMS)  and  processed  to  produce 
graphical  displays  based  on  current 
NFDRS  values.  Phase  1  gives  users 
the  opportunity  to  view  spatial  dis¬ 
plays  and  provides  us  with  feedback 
for  developing  future  products  in 
subsequent  phases. 

Phase  2.  During  phase  2,  improve¬ 
ments  to  NFDRS  calculations  will 
be  implemented,  but  that  system 
will  not  be  completely  redesigned. 
Because  it  is  so  important  to  com¬ 
pare  the  current  fire  danger  with 
historical  values,  there  will  be  a  na¬ 
tional  reanalysis  of  historical  data 
using  the  Fire  Information  Re¬ 
trieval  and  Evaluation  System 
(FIRES)  (Andrews  and  Bradshaw  in 
preparation)  to  calibrate  the  in¬ 
dexes.  The  main  products  devel¬ 
oped  during  phase  2  will  include 
new  dead  fuel  moisture  models  and 
new  live  fuel  moisture  models 
driven  by  Normalized  Difference 
Vegetation  Index  (NDVI)  data  re¬ 
ceived  via  satellite  (Burgan  and 
Hartford  1993).  Once  phase  2  is  fin¬ 
ished,  WFAS  will  use  the  National 
Weather  Service  (NWS)  as  a  pri¬ 
mary  source  of  weather  data.  Inclu¬ 
sion  of  observations  from  the  fire 
weather  network  will  be  optional 
for  broad-scale  assessment. 

Phase  3.  During  phase  3,  we  will 
use  a  gridded  weather  model  to  cal¬ 
culate  fire  potential  over  space  and 
time.  In  lieu  of  wind  observations 
or  wind  models,  WFAS  will  use 
wind  forecasts  and  estimated  wind 
values.  We  will  implement  new  fire 
spread,  fire  intensity,  large  fuel 
burnout,  and  crown  fire  models  in 
the  new  system.  In  addition,  we  will 
use  a  national  fuel  map  in  the  cal¬ 
culations.  Eventually,  WFAS  dis¬ 
plays  will  allow  dynamic  zooming 
to  allow  fire  behavior  assessments 
that  are  site  specific. 


Current  Status 

As  part  of  the  phased  development 
and  implementation,  we  made  pro¬ 
totypes  of  several  products  and  beta 
tested  them  during  the  summer  of 
1995;  they  are  now  routinely  avail¬ 
able.  Broad-area  weather  and  fire 
danger  maps  are  produced  from  the 
fire-weather-station  network  as  part 
of  phase  1.  As  a  preliminary  test  of 
phase  2  and  3  concepts,  high-reso¬ 
lution  fire  danger  maps  are  being 
produced  using  weather  data  from 
the  Oklahoma  Weather  Mesonet. 
Satellite-based  .6  mile-  (1  km-) 
resolution  fuel  and  greenness  data 
are  also  used. 

Broad  Area  Maps:  National  Map 
Prototypes.  WIMS  is  queried  for 
each  day’s  fire  weather  observations 
and  NFDRS  components  for  the 
primary  fuel  model  for  every  re¬ 
porting  station.  Project  scientists 
have  been  creating  national  maps 
on  a  workstation  in  the  Fire  Behav¬ 
ior  RWU  in  Missoula,  MT.  The  maps 
are  based  on  a  6  mile  (10  km)  cell 
size  using  a  weighted  inverse  dis¬ 
tance-squared  interpolation  scheme 
between  fire-weather-station  loca¬ 
tions.  The  entire  process  is  to  be 


transferred  to  the  National  Inter¬ 
agency  Fire  Center  (NIFC)  in 
Boise,  ID,  for  the  1997  fire  season. 

Colored  maps  are  produced  depict¬ 
ing  fire  weather  observations  of 
temperature,  relative  humidity,  24- 
hour  precipitation  totals,  and 
windspeed.  Maps  of  fire  danger 
components  include  the  1,000- 
hour  timelag  fuel  moisture, 
Keetch-Byram  Drought  Index 
(Keetch  and  Byram  1968),  and  ad¬ 
jective  class  (fig.  1).  In  most  cases, 
we  use  a  five-color  scheme  (green 
through  yellow  to  red). 

In  addition  to  collecting  the  fire- 
weather-network  observations, 
each  morning  computers  auto¬ 
matically  collect  data  from  all  the 
North  America  radiosonde  stations 
and  compute  a  Lower  Atmosphere 
Stability  Index  (Haines  1988). 
These  data  are  used  to  create  na¬ 
tional  and  North  American  Haines 
Index  maps  (fig.  2).

A  four-panel  vegetation  greenness

from  average  greenness  (Burgan  et 
al.  1996)  and  experimental  live 
shrub  moisture  (fig.  3).  These  maps 
have  a  .6  mile  (1  km)  spatial  resolu¬ 
tion  and  are  updated  weekly. 

The  broad  area  maps  are  distrib¬ 
uted  as  Graphics  Interchange  For¬ 
mat  (GIF)  files  over  three  networks. 
They  are  uploaded  to  the  WFAS  di¬ 
rectory  in  WIMS,  mailed  as  a  Data 
General  dumpfile  to  the  NIFC  in 
Boise,  ID,  and  the  Northern 
Rockies  Coordinating  Center  in 
Missoula,  MT,  and  posted  on  the 
USDA  Forest  Service’s  Internet 
Home  Page  (www.fs.fed.us/land/ 
wfas/welcome.html). 

As  a  result  of  our  current  experi¬ 
ence  with  the  maps,  we  make  the 
following  evaluation: 

•  Station  Density  and  NWS 
Weather  Streams.  The  higher 
station  density  in  the  Western 
United  States  facilitates  reason¬ 
able  broad  area  maps  of  fire  dan¬ 
ger  and  fire  weather  elements. 
The  lower  station  density  in  the 
Central  and  Eastern  States  leads 
to  obviously  bogus  interpolated 
fields.  This  highlights  the  need  to 
use  NWS  data  in  the  broad  area 
component  of  WFAS. 

•  Keetch-Byram  Drought  Index 
(KBDI).  Only  about  10  percent

rectly  cataloged  annual  precipita¬ 
tion  values,  a  requirement  for 
correct  computation  of  the  KBDI. 
The  station  density  for  the  KBDI 
map  is  generally  very  low,  there¬ 
fore  the  map  is  quite  unreliable 
on  a  national  basis.  This  situation 
could  be  resolved  if  fire  managers 
would  enter  the  average  annual 
precipitation  into  their  WIMS 
weather  station  catalogs.

danger  adjective  classes  are  taken 
directly  from  the  WIMS  computa¬

station,  number  of  staffing 
classes,  and  staffing  level  values 
cataloged  for  each  station’s  prior¬ 
ity-one  fuel  model.  About  90  per¬ 
cent  of  the  stations  cataloged  in 


WIMS  use  the  burning  index  (BI), 
and  the  rest  use  the  energy  re¬ 
lease  component  (ERG)  to  set 
their  adjective  class.  Groupings 
for  the  five  classifications  on  the 
weather  maps  were  based  on  our 
perception  of  reasonable  thresh¬ 
olds.  Experience  has  made  it 
clear  that  we  imparted  a  western 
(arid)  bias.  “Critical”  relative  hu¬ 
midities  in  the  Eastern  States  and 
Upper  Midwest,  for  example,  were 
not  reflected  correctly  in  the 
color  code.  More  analysis  (using 
FIRES)  is  required  to  delineate 
regional  threshold  values  for  fire 
weather  elements.

WFAS  Requires  a  Variety 
of  Weather  Information* 

Robert  E.  Burgan  and  Larry  S.  Bradshaw 


As  the  Fire  Behavior  Research 
Work  Unit  (RWU)  of  the  Inter¬ 
mountain  Research  Station 
has  been  developing  the  Wildland 
Fire  Assessment  System  (WFAS) 
(see  Burgan  et  al.  1997  in  this  is¬ 
sue  of  Fire  Management  Notes),  it 
has  been  abundantly  clear  that 
weather  inputs  are  the  most  diffi¬ 
cult  challenge  in  the  system’s 
development.  In  this  article,  there¬ 
fore,  we  discuss  required  weather 
inputs  to  the  WFAS  in  terms  of 
weather  parameters  and  temporal 
and  spatial  resolution.  We  also 
describe  briefly  a  system  that  pro¬ 
duces  fire  danger  maps  four  times 
daily  at  a  .6  mile  (1  km)  resolution 
for  the  State  of  Oklahoma  and 
present  it  as  an  early  step  in  the 
development  of  the  WFAS. 

WFAS  Definitions 
and  Attributes 

Fire  potential  in  WFAS  is  used  in  a 
generic  sense  to  refer  to  assess¬ 
ments  (at  whatever  time  and  spa¬ 
tial  scale)  that  fit  the  context  of  the 
following  discussion.  Fire  danger 
and  fire  behavior  are  terms  used  to 
describe  assessments  of  fire  poten¬ 
tial  on  different  time  and  space 
scales.  Fire  danger  is  evaluated 


Robert  Burgan  is  a  research  forester  and 
Larry  Bradshaw  is  a  meteorologist  for  the

Research  Station,  Fire  Behavior  Research 
Work  Unit,  Missoula,  MT. 


'"This  article  appeared,  in  part,  as  "Weather  Needs  for 
the  Wildland  Fire  Assessment  System"  in  Proceedings 
of  the  22nd  Conference  on  Agriculture  and  Forest 
Meteorology  with  Symposium  on  Fire  and  Forest 
Meteorology,  published  in  1996  in  Boston,  MA,  by  the 
American  Meteorological  Society,  pages  325-328. 


“The  single  largest 
challenge  to  building 
and  operating  the 
Wildland  Fire 
Assessment  System 
(WFAS)  is  collecting, 
processing,  and 
archiving  weather 
data.” 


routinely — at  least  once  a  day — for 
broad  areas.  Fire  behavior  assess¬ 
ments,  however,  are  made  for  spe¬ 
cific  sites  as  needed. 

With  the  attributes  already  in  place 
as  well  as  those  planned  for  the 
WFAS,  the  system  will: 

•  Require  minimal  data  from  user, 

•  Emphasize  map  and  graphical 
outputs, 

•  Provide  multilevel  resolution  in¬ 
puts  and  outputs, 

•  Reflect  diurnal  weather  varia¬ 
tions, 

•  Provide  “hooks”  to  related  mod¬ 
els  (e.g.,  smoke  dispersion  and 
fire  effects), 

•  Be  oriented  toward  workstations 
and  PC’s, 

•  Simulate  fire  characteristics, 

•  Be  operable  in  the  field, 

•  Relate  current  to  historical  con¬ 
ditions, 

•  Forecast  fire  potential  and  prob¬ 
abilities  on  national  to  local 
scales,  and 

•  Display  inputs,  outputs,  and  in¬ 
termediate  products. 


Weather  Data 

The  WFAS  is  being  designed  to 
provide  maximum  information  to 
the  user  with  minimum  interfer¬ 
ence  to  daily  work  schedules  in 
field  offices.  We  expect  that  the  Na¬ 
tional  Weather  System’s  (NWS) 
weather  stations  will  provide  a 
stable  “minimum  set”  of  weather 
stations  for  broad  scale  (national) 
fire  potential  assessment,  but  the 
WFAS  will  also  use  weather  data 
collected  by  various  agencies  (e.g., 
USDA  Forest  Service,  USDI  Bureau 
of  Land  Management  and  National 
Park  Service,  States)  as  much  as 
possible  and  include  local  area  re¬ 
finement  of  fire  assessments.  For 
broad  scale  assessments,  we  hope 
to  make  use  of  new  technology 
available  from  the  NWS  modern¬ 
ization  project — technology  that  is 
not  likely  to  be  available  from 
agency-operated  units.  Thus  two 
major  challenges  for  national  level 
fire  danger  assessment  are  1)  how 
to  make  the  best  use  of  new  NWS 
products  and  2)  how  best  to  use 
varying  agency  data  as  a  supple¬ 
ment  to  NWS  data. 

As  the  area  of  interest  focuses  from 
national  to  site  specific,  we  expect 
that  Remote  Automated  Weather 
Stations’  (RAWS)  data  or  other 
agency-collected  weather  data  will 
be  used  to  assess  specific  fire 
events. 

Capability  for 
Regular  Updates 

Fire  danger  has  traditionally  fo¬ 
cused  on  the  “worst  case”  scenario

Fire  Management  Notes 


by  using  1  or  2  p.m.  (local  time) 
weather  observations.  Automated 
weather  observations  and  satellite 
data  provide  an  opportunity  to  as¬ 
sess  fire  danger  throughout  a  day. 
Improved  temporal  resolution  of 
weather  data  would  provide  fire 
managers  with  more  timely  infor¬ 
mation  about  fire  potential,  per¬ 
haps  alerting  them  to  problems 
such  as  severe  conditions  develop¬ 
ing  late  in  the  day  or  poor  mois¬ 
ture  recovery  at  night. 

Fire  behavior  updates  could  make 
use  of  weather  data  updates  every  4 
to  6  hours,  but  spot  weather  fore¬ 
casts  generated  “on-demand”  for  a 
fire  area  will  still  be  required.  Fire 
researchers  are  working  with  the 
NWS  to  conduct  weather  modeling 
tests  to  determine  both  if  gridded 
data  can  be  refined  enough  to  be 
useful  for  areas  as  small  as  fire 
sites  and  how  fire  weather  forecast¬ 
ers  will  interface  with  WFAS. 

Archiving  Data 

Traditional  fire  danger  systems 
have  long  had  some  capability  to 
relate  current  fire  potential  condi¬ 
tions  to  historical  conditions.  Dis¬ 
playing  historical  data  infers  that 
major  decisions  will  have  to  be 
made  concerning  what  weather 
data  to  archive  and  how  to  both 
archive  and  make  that  data  avail¬ 
able  to  users.  It  does  not  seem  pru¬ 
dent  to  rely  on  the  NWS  to  archive 
weather  data  for  the  WFAS  because 
1 )  it  would  likely  have  to  be  pur¬ 
chased  from  them,  2)  it  would  not 
be  “on  line,”  3)  it  probably  would 
have  to  be  reformatted  before  it 
was  usable,  and  4)  it  would  not  be 
under  the  control  of  WFAS  manag¬ 
ers.  Therefore,  a  procedure  must 
be  devised  to  enable  WFAS  to 
“grab”  data  to  archive  for  later 
computing  of  current  fire  danger. 


Forecasting  Fire 
Potential 

Although  fire  potential  estimates 
will  be  updated  during  the  day,  fire 
weather  forecasts  must  be  made 
available  for  as  far  in  the  future  as 
they  can  be  reasonably  relied  upon. 
This  is  expected  to  be  a  maximum 
of  3  to  5  days.  Some  measure  of 
forecast  reliability  will  be  neces¬ 
sary.  The  specific  measure  and 
means  of  producing  and  displaying 
it  will  have  to  be  discussed  with 
the  NWS. 

National  scale  products  will  have 
to  rely  upon  nationally  available 
weather  products.  We  do  not  ex¬ 
pect  that  personal  interpretation 
by  fire  weather  forecasters  will  oc¬ 
cur  at  this  scale.  As  the  forecast 
area  decreases  and  one  begins  to 
look  at  site-  and  time-specific  situ¬ 
ations,  it  is  less  likely  a  weather 
station  will  exist  within  the  area  of 
interest.  If  the  forecast  area  is 
small  enough,  there  will  not  be  any 
weather  observations  taken  within 
it  unless  special  provisions  are 
made.  Therefore  forecast  weather 
parameters  for  fire  behavior  pre¬ 
dictions  will  most  likely  have  to 
come  from  spot  forecasts. 

Data  Displays 

Although  it  is  natural  to  focus  on 
the  final  fire  potential  outputs,  it  is 
likely  fire  managers  will  want  to 
see  some  of  the  raw  inputs  and  in¬ 
termediate  products  as  well.  For 
example,  the  NWS  should  provide 
satellite  images  and  graphical 
products  showing  weather  condi¬ 
tions  such  as  cloudiness,  the  loca¬ 
tion  of  fronts,  temperature  maps, 
and  wind  graphics.  Fire  managers 
will  also  want  to  view  such  graph¬ 
ics  as  fuel  moisture  or  drought 
maps,  fire  potential  maps,  and 
lightning  location  maps  generated 
by  WFAS.  Discussions  with  the 
NWS  and  fire  managers  will  help 


determine  which  inputs  and  out¬ 
puts  the  WFAS  will  display. 

Weather  Summary 

The  single  largest  challenge  to 
building  and  operating  the  WFAS  is 
collecting,  processing,  and 
archiving  weather  data.  The  follow¬ 
ing  describes  our  current  assess¬ 
ment  of  weather  needs,  subject  to 
review  and  change  as  development 
continues.  Required  weather  pa¬ 
rameters  for  broad  area  fire  poten¬ 
tial  assessments  are  1)  temper¬ 
ature,  relative  humidity,  solar  ra¬ 
diation,  precipitation  amount  and 
possibly  duration,  windspeed,  and 
wind  direction — all  near  ground 
level,  2)  moisture,  temperature, 
and  stability  of  the  lower  atmo¬ 
sphere,  and  3)  cloudiness,  lightning 
activity,  and  location  of  weather 
fronts.  With  the  possible  exception 
of  windspeed  and  wind  direction, 
these  inputs  should  be  obtained 
four  times  per  day  to  help  track  di¬ 
urnal  fire  danger  changes  and  pro¬ 
vide  input  to  fuel  moisture  models. 
These  data  should  be  available  on  at 
least  a  19-mile  (30-km)  grid  for  the 
Continental  United  States,  with  a  6- 
mile  (10-km)  grid  being  much  pre¬ 
ferred.  These  weather  parameters 
must  apply  to  the  near-surface  zone 
within  which  fires  burn  and  be  ad¬ 
justed  for  slope,  elevation,  and  as¬ 
pect.  We  hope  that  the  NWS  will  be 
able  to  make  these  adjustments. 

Windspeed  and  wind  direction  are 
very  difficult  to  project  realistically 
to  a  high  resolution  over  large  geo¬ 
graphic  areas,  but  it  would  be  very 
helpful  to  obtain  this  information 
in  a  relatively  broad  spatial  and 
temporal  context  at  the  least.  These 
two  inputs  need  to  be  defined  quite 
specifically  for  fire  behavior  appli¬ 
cations  to  be  site  and  time  specific. 
Depending  on  the  capabilities  of 
mesoscale  wind  models,  it  may  be

necessary  to  rely  on  forecaster  or 
user  inputs  of  windspeed  and  wind 
direction  for  local  areas. 

For  the  time  of  highest  fire  danger, 
which  varies  regionally,  24-hour 
forecast  data  of  fire  danger  should 
be  provided  at  least  once  daily,  and 
3-  to  5-day  forecasts  should  also  be 
updated  daily  for  the  Continental 
United  States.  All  weather  data 
should  be  adjusted  for  the  effects 
of  mountainous  terrain  and/or  ma¬ 
rine  influences. 

Outputs 

Low  Resolution  Outputs.  WFAS 
products  that  are  user  accessible 
will  come  in  the  form  of: 

•  Primary  maps ,  the  lowest  reso¬ 
lution  information  displays.  The 
maps  will  provide  the  most  pro¬ 
cessed  “overview”  data.  A  user 
should  be  able  to  click  a  button 
and  view  one  of  these  maps.  Ex¬ 
amples  include  lightning  occur¬ 
rence  and  energy  release 
component  maps. 

•  Intermediate  product  maps  that 
display  underlying  information 
are  being  considered.  Examples 
of  such  maps  are  a  cloudiness 
map,  Haines  Lower  Atmospheric 
Stability  Index  (Haines  1988), 
windspeed,  wind  direction, 
weather  fronts,  and  vegetation 
greenness. 

•  Non-map  graphics  that  display 
information  relating  to  the  con¬ 
ditions  of  specific  points  or  ar¬ 
eas,  such  as  weather  station 
locations,  ranger  districts,  or  na¬ 
tional  forests.  Examples  are  the 
fire  characteristics  chart  and 
seasonal  fire  potential  graphs. 

•  Alphanumerics,  which  are  the 
actual  numbers  that  underlie  the 
various  map  and  graphic  outputs 
(e.g.,  energy  release  component, 
burning  index,  greenness)  at  any 
location  for  any  of  the  primary 
or  intermediate  maps. 


High  Resolution  Outputs.  High 
resolution  outputs  require  site- 
and  time-specific  assessments  of 
fire  behavior  characteristics  such 
as  flame  length,  spread  rate,  and 
fire  intensity.  Such  assessments 
would  benefit  greatly  from  6- 
hourly  updates  of  forecast  weather 
conditions  at  spatial  scales  of  .6 
mile  to  33  yards  (1  km  to  30  m). 
Fuels  and  terrain  data  should  be 
presented  in  a  similar  spatial  scale. 
Because  it  is  unlikely  that  gridded 
weather  data  can  be  obtained  at 
these  scales,  provisions  will  have  to 
be  made  for  direct  weather  inputs 
by  fire  weather  forecasters  and 
temporary  RAWS.  The  fuel, 
weather,  and  terrain  data  will  be 
processed  in  a  fire  simulation  sys¬ 
tem  to  model  fire  behavior  and  lo¬ 
cation  of  problem  fires  over  the 
next  24  hours.  Planned  outputs  in¬ 
clude  maps  of  projected  fire  loca¬ 
tion  and  intensity,  plotted  either 
planimetrically  or  over  terrain. 

Calculating  Fire 
Danger  Maps  for 
Oklahoma 

The  primary  inputs  to  a  math¬ 
ematical  model  for  calculating  fire 
danger  are  fuels,  weather,  and 
topography.  See  figure  1  for  a  .6 
mile-  (1  km-)  resolution  fire  fuels 
map  for  Oklahoma.  Because  Okla¬ 
homa  is  relatively  flat,  elevation 
data  are  not  used  for  their  fire  dan¬ 
ger  calculations.  However,  eleva¬ 
tion  data  are  available  for  the 
conterminous  United  States  at  a  .6 
mile  (1  km)  resolution.  A  high 
resolution  weather  network  is  rare, 
but  the  University  of  Oklahoma 
(Crawford  1993)  is  operating  one 
for  Oklahoma.  Our  RWU  is  cooper¬ 
ating  with  the  university  to  use 
weather  observations  from  their 
mesonet  to  calculate  fire  danger 
for  the  State.  One  weather  station 
in  each  county  has  been  selected  to 
represent  the  weather  for  that 


county.  Figure  1  combines  weather 
stations  and  fuel  models  for  that 
State.  Because  the  topography  in 
Oklahoma  is  flat,  the  entire  State 
can  be  included  in  a  single  class  (0 
to  20  percent  slope). 

The  process  of  calculating  fire  dan¬ 
ger  maps  is  done  on  a  pixel-by¬ 
pixel  basis.  First,  weather  data 
from  the  mesonet  stations  are  used 
to  calculate  all  the  dead  fuel  mois¬ 
tures  (1,  10,  100,  and  1,000  hour) 
associated  with  each  weather  sta¬ 
tion.  The  dead  moistures  calcu¬ 
lated  from  composites  for  a 
weather  station  are  assigned  to  all 
pixels  within  the  county  in  which 
the  weather  station  is  located. 
These  moistures  are  saved  in  a 
separate  data  file. 

Live  herbaceous  and  shrub  mois¬ 
tures  are  calculated  for  each  pixel 
as  a  function  of  the  relative  green¬ 
ness  index,  which  is  derived  from 
the  Normalized  Difference  Vegeta¬ 
tion  Index,  which  is  in  turn  calcu¬ 
lated  from  weekly  composites  of 
Advanced  Very  High  Resolution 
Radiometer  Data  (Burgan  and 
Hartford  1993).  For  the  fire  danger 
calculations  in  figure  2,  three  in¬ 
put  map  layers  are  referenced:  1)  a 
map  that  identifies  the  county  each 
pixel  is  in,  2)  a  Relative  Greenness 
map  for  calculating  live  fuel  mois¬ 
tures,  and  3)  a  fuel  model  map 
consisting  of  a  fuel  model  number 
for  each  pixel.  For  each  pixel,  the 
county  map  layer  is  used  to  deter¬ 
mine  the  weather  station  repre¬ 
senting  that  pixel  (to  access  dead 
fuel  moistures);  the  fuels  map 
layer  is  used  to  identify  the  fuel 
model  for  that  pixel;  and  the  Rela¬ 
tive  Greenness  map  layer  is  used  to 
calculate  live  fuel  moistures  by 
pixel.  The  rest  of  the  calculations 
proceed  as  in  the  current  fire-dan¬ 
ger  rating  system.  However,  rather 
than  the  outputs  being  a  table  of

they  are  multicolored  maps  of  fire 
danger  (spread  component)  at  .6 
mile  (1  km)  resolution  for  the  State 
(fig.  3).  An  interesting  aspect  of  the 
final  fire  danger  map  is  that  it 
shows  even  gradation  of  fire  danger 
across  county  boundaries,  in  spite 
of  the  fact  that  all  the  pixels  in  each 
county  have  the  same  dead  fuel 
moisture  values.  This  occurs  be¬ 
cause  of  the  .6  mile  (1  km)  spatial 
variability  of  the  fuel  model  map 
and  the  live  herbaceous  and  shrub 
moisture  maps.  Such  maps  can  be 
produced  at  hourly  intervals. 

While  this  process  works  for  Okla¬ 
homa,  extending  the  process  to 
mountainous  terrain  will  require 
additional  research.  Methods  are 
required  to  adjust  the  weather  in¬ 
puts  for  the  effects  of  slope,  eleva¬ 
tion,  and  aspect. 

The  Oklahoma  effort  shows  that 
calculation  of  .6  mile-  (1  km-)  reso¬ 
lution  fire  danger  maps  is  feasible, 
even  without  weather  data  at  that 
resolution.  The  next  step  is  to  use 
NWS  gridded  data  to  produce  a 
similar  map  for  the  conterminous 
United  States.

High  Resolution  Fire 
Weather  Models 

Francis  M.  Fujioka 


The  next  generation  fire  danger 
and  fire  behavior  system  envi¬ 
sioned  by  the  Forest  Service 
(see  Burgan  et  al.  1997  and  Burgan 
and  Bradshaw  1997  in  this  issue  of 
Fire  Management  Notes)  will  as¬ 
sess  fire  potential  across  a  broad 
spectrum  of  space  and  time.  At  the 
incident  level,  fire  behavior  models 
will  require  detailed  descriptions  of 
the  spatial  and  temporal  variations 
of  weather  in  the  area  of  the  fire. 
Burgan  and  Bradshaw  (1997)  sug¬ 
gest  that  high  resolution  fire  be¬ 
havior  simulations  “. . .  would 
benefit  greatly  from  6-hourly  up¬ 
dates  of  forecast  weather  condi¬ 
tions  at  spatial  scales  of  .6  mile  to 
33  yards  (1  km  to  30  meters).”  By 
spatial  scale,  they  imply  the  dis¬ 
tance  between  the  points  of  a  rec¬ 
tangular  grid  on  which  weather, 
fuel,  and  terrain  conditions  are 
available  for  fire  behavior  simula¬ 
tions.  They  write:  “. .  it  is  unlikely 
that  gridded  weather  data  can  be 
obtained  at  these  scales,”  but  this 
paper  is  cautiously  optimistic  that 
we  are  closer  than  expected  to  high 
resolution  fire  weather  models. 

What  Is  a  Fire 
Weather  Model? 

For  the  purposes  of  this  article,  a 
fire  weather  model  is  a  scientific, 
computerized  method  of  describ¬ 
ing  spatial  and  temporal  variations 
of  weather.  The  primary  weather 
variables  of  interest  for  fire  behav¬ 
ior  modeling  are  the  near-surface

environment.” 

values  of  wind  direction,  wind- 
speed,  relative  humidity,  tem¬ 
perature,  solar  radiation,  and  pre¬ 
cipitation  amount.  All  of  these  can 
be  simulated  in  a  fire  weather 
model,  some  more  accurately  than 
others.  In  meteorology,  a  fire 
weather  model  is  described  as  me¬ 
soscale,  in  reference  to  the  par¬ 
ticular  spatial  scale  of  the  atmo¬ 
spheric  process  it  simulates  (for 
example,  see  Orlanski  1975). 
Mesoscale  models  are  typically 
used  to  simulate  convective  sys¬ 
tems  (e.g.,  storm  events)  and  local 
circulations  (e.g.,  sea  breeze,  winds 
over  complex  terrain).  They  may  be 
driven  by  synoptic  scale  weather 
models  that  describe  large  atmo¬ 
spheric  circulations  up  to  the  plan¬ 
etary  scale.  Synoptic  scale  models 
provide  the  national  weather  maps 
seen  in  newspapers  and  on  televi¬ 
sion.  Mesoscale  modeling  applica¬ 
tions  are  not  so  routine,  but  they 
have  recently  included  the  analysis 
of  fire  weather. 

The  Need  for  a  Fire 
Weather  Model 

A  fire  weather  model  is  needed  to 
provide  a  scientific,  comprehensive 
spatial  and  temporal  description  of 


the  near-surface  atmospheric  con¬ 
ditions  that  influence  the  fire  envi¬ 
ronment.  The  model  output  should 
be  in  a  coordinate  system 
coregistered  with  the  fuels  and  ter¬ 
rain  data  so  that  fire  behavior  cal¬ 
culations  can  be  obtained  over  the 
area  of  interest.  A  mesoscale  model 
based  on  the  physics  of  atmo¬ 
spheric  processes  ensures  that  the 
spatial  distribution  and  transfor¬ 
mation  of  fire  weather  variables  are 
generated  methodically  and  consis¬ 
tently.  The  model  should  also  in¬ 
corporate  large-scale  effects  of 
synoptic  systems  that  are  present, 
because  generally,  weather  condi¬ 
tions  on  a  local  scale  are  driven  by 
large-scale  weather.  A  computer¬ 
ized  fire  weather  model  coupled 
with  a  synoptic  model  is  a  powerful 
means  of  describing  the  weather 
part  of  the  fire  environment. 

Recently,  three  research  groups 
conducted  independent  fire 
weather  modeling  experiments 
that  portend  the  future  of  fire 
weather  analysis  and  forecasting. 
The  first  compared  a  fire  weather 
model  with  corresponding  data 
from  a  high  density  weather  sta¬ 
tion  network.  The  second  experi¬ 
ment  simulated  weather  on  Storm 
King  Mountain  during  the  tragic 
1994  fire.  The  third  experiment 
coupled  a  weather  model  and  a  fire 
behavior  model  so  that  the  fire 
influenced  the  weather  and  vice 
versa.

simulations  (Ueyoshi  et  al.  1995).  The  grid  points  located  at  the  origins  of  the  wind 
vectors  are  1.2  miles  (2  km)  apart. 


Western  States  but  are  of  no  less 
concern  to  local  fire  managers. 

Fire  weather  conditions  in  Hawaii 
are  unique  compared  to  weather  in 
the  other  States.  On  the  island  of 
Maui,  a  local  circulation  feature 
called  the  Maui  vortex,  or  Maui 
eddy,  can  change  the  wind  direc¬ 
tion  by  180  degrees  within  a  few 
miles,  significantly  affecting  the 
behavior  of  potential  fires.  The  vor¬ 
tex  is  also  known  to  trap  ash  and 
smoke  issuing  from  pre-harvest 
burning  of  sugar  cane  in  the  cen¬ 
tral  valley  of  Maui  (Schroeder 
1993),  thus  degrading  air  quality. 

We  used  a  mesoscale  model  devel¬ 
oped  over  a  period  of  years  at  Colo¬ 
rado  State  University  to  simulate 
the  weather  conditions  over  Maui 
in  July  1988  (Ueyoshi  et  al.  1995). 
Called  RAMS  (Regional  Atmo¬ 
spheric  Modeling  System),  the 
model  incorporates  the  physical 
laws  governing  atmospheric  pro¬ 
cesses.  In  this  study,  we  calcu¬ 
lated — at  10-second  intervals — 
winds,  temperature,  and  relative 
humidity  at  points  spaced  1.2 
miles  (2  km)  apart  in  a  rectangular 
grid  measuring  67  miles  by  55 
miles  (112  km  by  92  km)  (fig.  1). 
The  short  time  step  is  necessary  to 
preserve  the  numerical  stability  of 
computerized  methods  used  to 
solve  the  model’s  underlying  equa¬ 
tions.  Vertical  variations  are  also 
captured  at  23  levels  of  a  terrain¬ 
following  coordinate  system.  The 
model  can  thus  simulate  impor¬ 
tant  fire  weather  effects  such  as 
inversions,  precipitation,  and 
momentum  transfer  between 
layers  of  the  atmosphere.  Model 
simulations,  however,  should  be 
checked  against  the  real  world 
conditions  they  represent  when¬ 
ever  possible.  We  compared  our 
simulations  with  weather  data 
from  remote  automatic  weather 
stations  deployed  by  a  sugar  plan¬ 
tation  in  the  central  valley  of  Maui. 


The  plantation  uses  weather  infor¬ 
mation  to  determine  when  the 
sugar  cane  can  be  burned  without 
significant  air  quality  deterioration 
in  sensitive  areas.  In  July  1988,  the 
weather  stations  lay  in  that  part  of 
the  vortex  where  average  wind- 
speeds  apparently  were  greatest. 

We  found  that  the  mesoscale 
model  frequently  overestimated 
windspeed  by  as  much  as  7  mi/h  (3 
m/sec).  The  model  errors  were 
larger  at  night  and  early  morning 
than  they  were  during  the  day.  The 
model  did  not  reproduce  the  diur¬ 
nal  range  in  windspeed  that  actu¬ 
ally  occurred,  but  it  seemed  to  be 
in  phase  with  the  observed 
windspeed  oscillation,  except  near 
the  center  of  the  vortex.  There,  the 
peak  in  the  average  observed 
windspeed  lagged  behind  the  aver¬ 
age  model  windspeed  by  approxi¬ 
mately  4  hours.  Consequently,  the 
model  underestimated  the  average 
windspeed  during  most  of  the  af¬ 
ternoon  hours.  In  all  cases,  the 
model  wind  direction  was  in  fairly 
good  agreement  with  the  observed 
wind  direction. 


An  intriguing  feature  of  the  fire 
weather  simulations  was  the  be¬ 
havior  of  temperature  and  relative 
humidity  in  the  lee  of  the  ridge 
line  extending  northward  from  the 
summit  of  Mt.  Haleakala,  the  large 
shield  volcano  that  dominates 
Maui’s  topography.  The  mesoscale 
model  showed  that,  as  the  trade 
winds  descended  from  the  ridge 
and  turned  south  from  their  west¬ 
ward  trek,  the  layer  of  air  immedi¬ 
ately  above  the  surface  layer 
became  warm  and  dry,  apparently 
due  to  the  spreading  and  sinking  of 
air  as  the  flow  accelerated  south¬ 
ward  on  the  western  side  of  the 
vortex.  The  combination  of  warm¬ 
ing,  drying,  and  accelerating  air 
flow  can  invigorate  a  fire  in  this 
area,  if  this  layer  descends  to  the 
level  of  the  fuels. 

The  mesoscale  model  simulations 
provided  details  that  we  have  not 
seen  before,  but  the  spacing  hori¬ 
zontally  (1.2  miles  or  2  km)  and 
vertically  (260  feet  or  80  m  in  the 
lowest  layer)  is  probably  still  too 
coarse.  The  Maui  model  also  needs

types. 

Storm  King  Mountain 
Simulation 

Fire  weather  models  can  be  used  to 
study  historic  fires.  Scientists  at 
the  Los  Alamos  National  Labora¬ 
tory  applied  the  RAMS  mesoscale 
model  to  simulate  weather  condi¬ 
tions  that  occurred  on  Storm  King 
Mountain  on  the  afternoon  of  July 
6,  1994.  They  used  a  grid  with 
points  spaced  165  feet  (50  m)  apart 
in  preparation  for  a  subsequent  fire 
behavior  simulation  (fig.  2).  At  this 
grid  resolution,  the  model’s  com¬ 
puting  requirements  are  excessive 
for  all  but  the  most  powerful  ma¬ 
chines.  At  the  initial  stages  of  the 
Los  Alamos  simulations,  1  hour  of 
simulated  weather  required  35 
hours  of  computing  time  on  a  rela¬ 
tively  high-speed  Unix  workstation. 
Since  then,  a  version  of  the  model 
code  has  been  developed  for  paral¬ 
lel  processors — computers  with 
multiple  processing  units,  each 
working  on  a  portion  of  the  model 
calculations.  This  has  brought  the 
computing  time  for  a  1-hour  simu¬ 
lation  down  from  35  hours  to  1.5 
hours  and  is  likely  to  shrink  the  ra¬ 
tio  even  further  (Bossert  1996). 

The  improvement  in  computing 
performance  brings  this  mesoscale 
modeling  code  into  the  range  of 
feasibility  for  fire  weather  predic¬ 
tion. 

The  Interaction 
Between  Weather 
and  Fire 

A  significant  recent  development 
in  fire  modeling  is  the  coupled  at¬ 
mosphere-fire  model,  which  simu¬ 
lates  the  feedback  between  the 
atmosphere  and  fire.  This  research 
is  necessary  to  understand  such 
conditions  as  blowup  fires.  Scien¬ 
tists  at  the  National  Center  for  At¬

July  6,  1994  (from  Bossert  1996).  Distance  between  the  bases  of  adjacent  vectors  is 
165  feet  (50  m).  Vector  lerigth  is  proportional  to  windspeed. 


mospheric  Research  have  coupled 
a  mesoscale  weather  model  and  a 
simple  fire  behavior  model  for  a 
dry  eucalyptus  forest  (Clark  et  al. 
1996).  This  project  started  only  re¬ 
cently,  but  some  interesting  results 
have  already  been  obtained.  The  re¬ 
searchers  have,  for  example,  iden¬ 
tified  a  mechanism  that  produces 
parabolic  fire  fronts.  In  simula¬ 
tions  of  an  initially  straight  fire 
front  subjected  to  a  certain  range 
of  light  winds,  the  center  of  the 
front  accelerates  preferentially,  be¬ 
cause  the  convection  column  in¬ 
duced  by  the  fire  tilts  ahead  of  the 
front  and  draws  more  air  from  the 
middle  of  the  fire  line  than  from 
the  ends;  hence  the  windspeed  and 
fire  spread  are  faster  across  the 
center.  As  a  result,  the  fire  line 
takes  on  the  shape  of  a  parabola. 
Under  certain  conditions  that  are 
still  not  fully  understood,  the  ac¬ 
celerations  of  the  fire  front  are 
rapid  and  highly  localized;  the  sci¬ 
entists  call  this  event  “dynamic  fin¬ 
gering.”  The  simulation  in  figure  3 


shows  an  example  of  two  fingers 
developing  along  an  initially 
straight  fire  line  and  the  attendant 
wind  pattern  at  a  height  of  363  feet 
(110  m).  In  this  case,  the  wind 
ahead  of  the  fire  is  drawn  between 
the  fingers,  where  it  opposes  the 
direction  of  the  propagating  fire.  A 
critical  measure  of  atmosphere-fire 
interaction  is  the  ratio  of  the  ki¬ 
netic  energy  of  the  air  flow  over 
the  fire  to  the  buoyant  energy  of 
the  heat  of  the  fire.  When  this  ratio 
is  small,  conditions  are  enhanced 
for  a  blowup  fire.  In  this  case, 
winds  are  relatively  light  over  the 
fire,  while  the  fire  itself  is  ener¬ 
getic.  A  somewhat  counterintuitive 
finding  is  that  strong  winds  (high 
kinetic  energy  to  buoyant  energy 
ratio)  stabilize  the  fire  front  dy¬ 
namics,  even  as  they  increase  the 
spread  rate.  Apparently,  when 
windspeeds  exceed  a  critical  value, 
the  convective  column  is  displaced 
too  far  from  the  fire  front  to  pro¬ 
duce  any  significant  interaction 
with  the  fire.

indicates  vertical  velocity  of  air  flow. 


At  this  stage,  the  coupled  model  is 
less  predictive  than  it  is  indicative 
of  the  complex  interactions  that 
play  out  between  a  fire  and  the  at¬ 
mosphere.  It  promises  significant 
insight  into  the  processes  creating 


blowups  and  spotting.  All  of  the 
models  described  above,  complex 
as  they  are,  nevertheless  are  sim¬ 
plifications  of  reality.  At  best, 
model  simulations  can  be  expected 
to  resemble  the  real  world  only  ap¬ 


proximately.  Fire  scientists  must 
describe  model  uncertainties  as  de¬ 
finitively  as  possible,  and  fire  prac¬ 
titioners  must  understand  the 
limitations  of  models.  We  cannot 
have  one  without  the  other,  if  we 
are  to  apply  fire  weather  and  fire 
behavior  modeling  successfully  in 
fire  management.

Making  Sense  of  Fire  Weather

district  ranger  checks  the  lo¬ 
cal  weather  conditions  and 
notes  high  windspeeds.  In  an¬ 
other  district,  the  ranger  sees  low 
relative  humidity  is  predicted  for 
her  area.  A  third  ranger  looks  at 
the  nearest  upper-air  report  and 
finds  strong  wind  shear  and  an  un¬ 
stable  temperature  profile.  Which 
ranger  or  rangers  should  consider 
their  observations  as  indicative  of 
high  weather-related  fire  risk? 

The  general  public  and  fire  manag¬ 
ers  alike  commonly  consider  a  va¬ 
riety  of  weather-related  variables  to 
be  indicators  of  fire  risk.  These 
include  surface  air  temperature, 
windspeed,  and  humidity.  Fire 
managers  and  foresters  may  hear 
or  believe  that  wind  shear  and  sta¬ 
bility  also  contribute  to  fire  risk. 
While  researchers  repeatedly  note 
that  various  conditions  precede  or 
accompany  large  wildland  fires, 
they  have  not  examined  whether 
these  same  conditions  are  equally 
common  on  days  when  no  fires 
occur  or  when  only  small  or  con¬ 
trollable  fires  occur.  When  fire 
managers  know  which  weather- 
related  variables  discriminate 
typical  weather  conditions  from 
weather  associated  with  large  fires, 
they  can  prepare  for  the  possibility 
of  a  large  wildland  fire  developing. 

Methods  Used 

I  analyzed  data  for  339  large  wild¬ 
land  fires  that  occurred  in  the  Con¬ 
tinental  United  States  from  1971 
through  1984.  Each  fire  burned

When  fire  managers 
know  which  weather- 
related  variables 
discriminate  “large-fire” 
weather  from  typical 
weather  conditions, 
they  can  prepare  for 
the  possibility  of  a  large 
wildland  fire  developing. 


1,000  acres  (400  ha)  or  more.  I  as¬ 
sociated  each  fire  with  the  nearest 
upper-air  weather  station  and  clas¬ 
sified  it  according  to  its  season 
(spring,  summer,  autumn,  or  win¬ 
ter).  I  dropped  any  station  and  sea¬ 
son  with  fewer  than  five  associated 
fires  from  the  analysis.  Figure  1 
shows  the  number  of  fires  for  each 
station  that  remained. 

For  each  fire  day,  I  used  statistical 
analysis  of  variance,  a  technique 


that  indicates  whether  or  not  the 
fire  and  typical  values  are  signifi¬ 
cantly  different,  to  compare  the 
following  six  measurements  with 
“typical”  values  for  the  same  sta¬ 
tion  and  season: 

•  Surface  air  temperature, 

•  Relative  humidity, 

•  Dewpoint  depression, 

•  Stability, 

•  Windspeed,  and 

•  Wind  shear. 

Note  that  dewpoint  depression  is 
the  difference  between  actual  air 
temperature  and  dewpoint  tem¬ 
perature.  It  is  not  the  same  as 
wetbulb  depression,  which  appears 
on  the  psychrometric  charts  in 
many  belt  weather  kits.  Dewpoint 
depression  is  always  greater  than 
wetbulb  depression. 

Also  note  both  the  size  of  the  wild¬ 
land  fires  considered  here  and  the 
location  of  the  weather  observa-

tions.  The  fires  are  all  large  fires — 
the  more  numerous  small  fires  may 
show  stronger  or  weaker  correla¬ 
tions  with  some  of  the  weather  vari¬ 
ables.  The  observations  indicate  the 
weather  conditions  on  a  horizontal 
scale  of  about  62  miles  (100  km).  A 
fire,  once  started,  begins  to  alter 
some  of  these  conditions  (such  as 
wind),  and  onsite  measurements  of 
any  weather  variable  may  differ 
from  measurements  taken  several 
miles  away  from  the  fire. 

Results  Found 

The  results  of  my  analyses  show 
that  surface  temperature  and 
dewpoint  depression  are  substan¬ 
tially  higher  on  fire  days  than  they 
are  on  a  typical  day  for  a  given  loca¬ 
tion  and  season.  Relative  humidity 
is  considerably  lower  on  fire  days. 
Windspeed,  wind  shear,  and  stability 
did  not  show  any  significant  differ¬ 
ences  between  fire  and  nonfire  days. 
In  other  words,  it  is  the  more 
straightforward  and  commonly 
known  atmospheric  properties — 
high  temperatures  and  low  air 
moisture  contents — that  most  sig¬ 
nificantly  contribute  to  weather-re¬ 
lated  fire  risk.  Thus,  the  answer  to 
the  question  in  the  first  paragraph 
is  clear:  The  second  ranger,  who  saw 
the  forecast  of  low  relative  humid¬ 
ity,  should  be  particularly  alert  to 
the  possibility  that  the  weather  will 
contribute  to  the  development  of  a 
large  wildland  fire. 

In  examining  the  six  weather  vari¬ 
ables  at  individual  stations,  I  found 
that  neither  fire-day  stability  nor 
fire-day  wind  shear  showed  any  sig¬ 
nificant  difference  from  typical  val¬ 
ues  at  any  of  the  20  stations  tested. 
Windspeed  proved  significant  at  just 
two  of  the  stations,  relative  humid¬ 
ity  at  four,  surface  temperature  at 
seven,  and  dewpoint  depression  at 
ten  (or  half)  of  the  stations.  The  sta¬ 
tions  where  surface  temperature

While  they  are  not  a  substitute  for 
first-hand  experience,  these  find¬ 
ings  can  be  helpful  to  fire  manag¬ 
ers  and  district  rangers.  They 
suggest  that  the  conditions  that  re¬ 
ally  matter  are  those  at  the  sur¬ 
face — stability  and  wind  shear  may 
not  be  very  good  fire-weather  indi¬ 
cators.  Regardless  of  what  part  of 
the  country  you  are  in,  dewpoint 
depression  is  a  robust  indicator  of 
the  weather-related  fire  risk.  Rela¬ 
tive  humidity,  which  also  measures 
the  moisture  in  the  air,  is  almost  as 
good  and  more  readily  available  in 


weather  reports.  As  experienced 
fire  managers  know,  even  without 
any  measurements  or  weather  re¬ 
ports,  they  can  use  their  own 
“senses”  to  get  a  good  idea  what 
the  temperature,  humidity,  and 
windspeed  are. 

With  weather  measurements,  how¬ 
ever,  fire  managers  can  use  the  ap¬ 
plicable  Table  1  to  quickly  convert 
relative  humidity  and  temperature 
to  dewpoint  depression.  This 
Dewpoint  Depression  Table  (shown 
both  in  Fahrenheit  and  Celsius) 
can  be  photocopied,  laminated, 
and  kept  in  belt  weather  kits  for 
use  at  any  altitude.  ■

SODAR  aimd  Decisionmaking 
During  the  Fork  Fire 


Fred  Svetz  and  Alexander  N.  Barnett 


On  the  Fork  Fire,  a  SODAR  unit  assisted  personnel 
with  forecasting  and  decisionmaking.  During  a 
weather-driven  firestorm  that  consumed  40,000 
acres  (16,200  ha)  in  6  hours,  there  were  no 
burnovers,  no  equipment  loses,  and  no  injuries 
attributed  to  fire  behavior.

surround  SODAR 's  antennas  and  drivers  mounted  on  the  trailer  that  transports  them  to 
the  field.  The  enclosures  dampen  SODAR 's  sound  pulses  and  reduce  the  impact  of 
background  noises  to  increase  the  sensitivity  of  its  measurements.  Photo:  Ken  Underwood,

What  does  an  Incident  Meteo¬ 
rologist  (IMET)  do  when 
anticipating  a  frontal  pas¬ 
sage  likely  to  create  strong  winds 
and  erratic  fire  behavior  during  a 
wildland  fire?  At  the  Fork  Fire  on 
the  Mendocino  National  Forest  in 
August  1996,  the  IMET  requested 
an  acoustic  wind  profiler  or  SODAR 
(SOund  Detection  And  Ranging) 
unit.  He  felt  that  a  SODAR’s  capa¬ 
bility  to  measure  low-level  winds 
continuously  would  help  him  moni¬ 
tor  expected  environmental  changes 
and  improve  his  forecasts. 

What  Is  SODAR? 

The  SODAR  is  a  remote-sensing  in¬ 
strument  that  uses  sound  to  mea¬ 
sure  windspeed,  wind  direction,  and 
atmospheric  stability  up  to  2,000  to 
3,200  feet  (750  to  1,050  m)  above 
the  ground  at  100  feet  (30  m)  inter¬ 
vals.  It  can  provide  averaged  wind 
data  every  5  minutes,  every  hour,  or 
at  other  intervals  in  between. 

While  other  sizes  of  wind  profilers 
with  varying  operating  or  output 
frequencies  are  available,  the 
SODAR  unit  used  on  the  Fork  Fire 
was  an  AeroVironment  Inc.  Model 
2000  (AV2000),*  consisting  of 

•  Three  parabolic  dish  antennas 
and  acoustic  drivers  mounted  on 
a  30-foot  (10  m)  trailer  (fig.  1).

SODAR  Set  Up 

The  SODAR  unit  was  deployed  in 
the  extreme  northwestern  corner 
of  the  fire  zone,  just  below  the 
ridge  defined  in  figure  3.  The  site 
was  3,200  feet  (1,050  m)  above  sea 
level  in  a  picnic  area  on  a  hillside 
overlooking  the  fire  zone.  This  site 
was  selected  because 

•  Background  noise  levels  were 
low  (below  50  decibels). 

•  There  were  no  physical  obstruc¬ 
tions  in  the  SODAR  beam  paths. 

•  The  elevation  was  adequate  to 
ensure  that  beam  coverage

•  It  was  upwind  of  the  fire  zone  to 
help  safeguard  the  operator  and 
to  detect  changes  before  they

SODAR  in  Operation 

Because  the  IMET  wanted  the 
SODAR  to  collect  data  for  24  to  48 
hours  prior  to  the  arrival  of  the 
weather  front,  SODAR  began  its 
measurements  at  0900  Rd.t.  on 
August  16.  Deploying  the  SODAR 
unit  well  before  the  arrival  of  the 
front  meant  that  the  IMET  could 
easily  compare  baseline  weather 
conditions  with  changes  brought 
about  by  the  frontal  passage. 


operator  called  the  IMET  and  read 
him  the  windspeed  and  wind-direc¬ 
tion  data  in  miles  per  hour  and  de¬ 
grees  for  the  10-minute  interval 
occurring  just  previous  to  tele¬ 
phoning.  The  IMET  transcribed  the 


verbal  windspeed  and  wind-direc¬ 
tion  information  onto  data  transfer 
forms  to  interpret  and  use  later.  As 
a  backup,  the  SODAR  operator  also 
had  a  command  radio,  but  he  used 
it  only  when  the  SODAR  noted 
changes  in  wind  patterns  or  trends 
between  the  hourly  cellular  con¬ 
tacts  or  when  cellular  communica¬ 
tions  in  the  remote  location  were 
not  available.  It  should  be  noted 
that  future  technological  improve¬ 
ments  could  include  the  use  of  ra¬ 
dio  or  satellite  phone  communi¬ 
cations  to  allow  the  SODAR’s 
computer  to  be  located  where  the 
IMET  and  Fire  Behavior  Analysts 
(FBA’s)  are  preparing  their 
forecasts. 

The  IMET  used  the  data  to  develop 
a  “blueprint”  of  wind  patterns  and 
stable  layer  development  and  dissi¬ 
pation  occurring  during  a  normal 
daily  cycle  in  the  fire  zone.  The 
IMET  found  that  weather  observa¬ 
tions  from  the  fire  crew  showed  ex¬ 
cellent  agreement  with  the  SODAR 
data.  This  confidence  in  the

SODAR  prompted  the  IMET  to  use 
the  observations  in  the  preparation 
of  twice-daily  weather  forecasts 
and  encouraged  the  FBA’s  to  use 
the  data  in  their  forecasts  as  well. 

SODAR’s  Success 

When  the  Incident  Command  (IC) 
staff  determined  that  weather  and 
fire  behavior  forecasts  continued 
to  correlate  well  with  actual  condi¬ 
tions  in  the  fire  zone,  their  confi¬ 
dence  in  the  IMET’s  ability 
increased.  On  August  18,  the  day 
the  front  was  expected,  the  IMET’s 
forecast  was:  Morning  winds  south 
to  west,  4  to  8  mph  (6  to  12  kph) 
with  gusts  to  14  mph  (23  kph), 
changing  in  the  afternoon  to  west 
to  northwest  winds,  10  to  20  mph 
(16  to  32  kph)  with  gusts  to  30 
mph  (48  kph).  The  confidence  of 
the  IC  staff  in  the  weather  and  fire 
behavior  forecasts  weighed  heavily 
in  their  deciding  not  to  assign

pointing  downward.  By  emitting  a  sound 
pulse  at  a  known  frequency  and  monitor¬ 
ing  the  Doppler  shift  of  the  return  echoes, 
the  instrument  calculates  the  windspeed 
and  wind  direction  at  various  altitudes.

crews  in  the  expected  path  of  the 
fire.  They  held  back  all  fire  crews 
and  equipment,  except  for  a  lim¬ 
ited  number  of  crews  assigned  to 
hold  the  flanks  and  bulldozer  op¬ 
erators  constructing  fire  breaks  to 
save  endangered  communities. 

One  hour  before  the  weather 
front's  arrival,  the  SODAR  detected 
increasing  windspeeds  at  the  level 
of  the  ridge  tops  (approximately 
1,000  feet  (330  m)  above  the  aver¬ 
age  elevation  of  the  fire).  This 
1-hour  warning  gave  the  IC  staff 
time  to  move  remaining  fire  crews 
and  equipment  out  of  danger  from 
the  expected  runs.  Within  the  next 
6  hours,  an  explosively  developing 
firestorm  consumed  40,000  acres 
(16,200  ha).  Yet  during  this  period, 
there  were  no  burnovers,  no  equip¬ 
ment  losses,  and  no  injuries  attrib¬ 
uted  to  fire  behavior. 

Results  of  SODAR  Use 

The  SODAR  unit  proved  to  be  a 
valuable  tool  for  characterizing 
wind  and  stability  patterns  that  in¬ 


fluenced  fire  behavior  on  the  Fork 
Fire.  It  provided  the  IMET  with  a 
rare  opportunity  to  gather  quanti¬ 
tative  low-level  wind  data  on  a  near 
real-time  basis.  The  consistency 
and  reliability  of  these  data  from 
an  area  immediately  adjacent  to 
the  wildfire  (compared  to  occa¬ 
sional  surface  observations  from 
spotters  in  the  field)  made  it  pos¬ 
sible  to  verify  wind  forecasts  for 
the  fire  area,  which  in  turn  in¬ 
creased  the  IMET’s  confidence  in 
the  accuracy  of  his  forecasts  and 
prevented  misanalysis  of  the  low- 
level  wind  field. 

The  IC  staff  also  gained  confidence 
in  the  forecasts.  As  a  result,  they 
placed  greater  emphasis  on  them 
when  planning  their  fire  suppres¬ 
sion  strategies.  SODAR  data  helped 
to  provide  them  with  an  objective 
basis  for  their  decisionmaking  con¬ 
cerning  the  expected  erratic  fire 
behavior  during  the  frontal  pas¬ 
sage  and  helped  to  give  an  addi¬ 
tional  margin  to  ensure  firefighter 
safety. 


Fire  Management  Notes 


The  Future 

We  hope  that  the  success  of  the 
SODAR  at  the  Fork  Fire  will  open 
discussions  among  IC  staffs  na¬ 
tionwide  concerning  how  this 
technology  can  regularly  be  incor¬ 
porated  into  wildland  fire  suppres¬ 
sion  strategies.  When  erratic  fire 
behavior  is  occurring  or  expected, 
a  SODAR  can  be  a  resource  to  as¬ 
sist  the  IMET  with  forecasting  and 
IC  staffs  with  their  decision¬ 
making.  When  erratic  fire  behavior 
is  not  expected,  a  SODAR  can  be 


Guidelines  for 

Editorial  Policy 

Fire  Management  Notes  (FMN)  is  an  inter¬ 
national  quarterly  magazine  for  the  wild¬ 
land  fire  community.  FMN  welcomes 
unsolicited  manuscripts  from  readers  on 
any  subject  related  to  fire  management. 
(See  the  subject  index  of  the  first  issue  of 
each  volume  for  a  list  of  topics  covered  in 
the  past.) 

Because  space  is  a  consideration,  long 
manuscripts  are  subject  to  publication  de¬ 
lay  and  editorial  cutting;  FMN  does  print 
short  pieces  of  interest  to  readers. 

Submission  Guidelines 

Authors  are  asked  to  type  or  word-process 
their  articles  on  white  paper  (double¬ 
spaced)  on  one  side.  Try  to  keep  titles  con¬ 
cise  and  descriptive;  subheadings  and 
bulleted  material  are  useful  and  help  read¬ 
ability.  As  a  general  rule  of  clear  writing, 
use  the  active  voice  (e.g.,  Fire  managers 
know  . . .  not,  It  is  known  .  . .). 

Submit  articles  to  either  the  general  man¬ 
ager  or  the  editor.  Complete  details  to
