Pat Dye Field at Jordan-Hare Stadium 


Pat Dye Field at Jordan-Hare Stadium, the nation’s 11th-largest on- 
campus stadium with a capacity of 87,451, is entering its 74th year as 
home to the Auburn Tigers. 

On football Saturdays in Auburn, Jordan-Hare Stadium becomes 
Alabama’s sixth-largest city. More than 75,000 season tickets have been 
sold to Auburn home games in each of the last 18 years. 

The stadium is named for Ralph “Shug” Jordan, Auburn’s all-time 
winningest football coach, and Clifford Leroy Hare, a member of 
Auburn’s first football team, president of the old Southern Conference 
and longtime chairman of Auburn’s Faculty Athletic Committee. 

Legendary coach Pat Dye has also had his name forever attached to 
Jordan-Hare Stadium, as the turf officially became known as Pat Dye 
Field at Jordan-Hare Stadium prior to the 2005 Iron Bowl. Dye, who 
served as head coach and athletics director at Auburn (1981-92) and 
was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame (2005), led Auburn 
to a 99-39-4 record and four SEC Championships in his 12 seasons on 
the Plains. 

What is now Jordan-Hare Stadium was first opened and dedicated on 
Nov. 30, 1939, at the Auburn-Florida game. Babe McGehee, who passed 
away Oct. 1, 2005, scored the first touchdown in what was then called 
“Auburn Stadium,” by catching a pass from Dick McGowen. McGowen, 
who later coached at Auburn under Jordan, kicked the extra point and 
Auburn tied Florida, 7-7. 

That first stadium held 7,500 seats and consisted of what is now the 
bottom part of the lower west stands. When the stadium was renamed 
“Cliff Hare Stadium” in 1949, 14,000 seats—the present lower east 
stands—had been added, raising capacity to 21,500. 

Jordan became head coach in 1951 and the stadium that was to bear 
his name underwent three major expansions in 15 years. More than 
40,000 seats, virtually half of the stadium’s present capacity, were added 
while Jordan was the coach. 

Cliff Hare Stadium became Jordan-Hare Stadium in 1973. It was the 
first stadium in the country to be named for an active coach. 

The history of Auburn Football can be seen by standing in the middle 
of the playing field and looking at various additions. The original sta- 
dium consisted of the bottom half of the lower west stands and later the 
east stands. Jordan teams added the top half of the lower west stands and 
the north and south end zone seats. 

Players such as William Andrews, Joe Cribbs and James Brooks 
brought about the west side upper deck in 1980 and the success of Pat 
Dye-coached teams led to the addition of the east side upper deck and 
luxury suites in 1987. 

A football attendance record for the state of Alabama was set in the very 
first game of the “new” stadium when 80,000 fans came to see Auburn 
defeat Texas 31-3 in the 1987 season opener. Two more 80,000-plus 
crowds came to Auburn that season and within two years Jordan-Hare

Pat Dye Field at Jordan-Hare Stadium 


Jordan-Hare Stadium Locker Rooms 


The locker rooms in Jordan-Hare Stadium are some of the 
finest game-day locker rooms in college football. Auburn’s locker 
room encompasses the entire south end zone, utilizing the space 
that was once both the Auburn and visitors’ dressing areas. 

Auburn’s locker room measures 3,232 square feet. It houses 
oak lockers in an open area that is carpeted. The carpet includes a 
large AU logo in the center of the dressing room which, according 
to tradition started by the 2000 senior class, can not be stepped 
on by a player or coach. A matching AU hangs from the ceiling. 
The room is connected to the stadium’s closed-circuit television 
system and has four monitors for viewing. 

Additionally, the locker room features flat screen televisions 
and a state-of-the-art sound system. It also includes graphics and 
displays for Auburn’s three Heisman Trophy winners. 

Adjacent to the main locker room is a large ceramic tile 
shower and restroom facilities, an overflow locker room for non- 
conference games, an equipment room and a room that houses 
X-ray equipment. 

In addition to the main dressing area, the locker room also 
contains a state-of-the-art training room and media room. 

The Tigers enter the field from the center of the south end 
zone. While “Eye of the Tiger” is played on the stadium sound 
system, Auburn takes the field through a cloud of smoke and 
thunderous cheers from more than 87,000 fans. 

The visitor’s locker room is in the north end zone and con- 
tains a dressing room, coach’s locker room, media room and 
training room. The visiting team enters the field through the 
northeast corner of the end zone. 


Jordan-Hare Stadium Recruiting Lounge 
and Tiger Walk Plaza 


The Tiger Walk Plaza was completed in the summer of 
2001. The courtyard serves as the conclusion of Tiger Walk, 
the entrance to the home locker rooms and a recruit assembly 
room. The enclosed courtyard is paved with approximately 6,000 
inscribed brick pavers purchased by Auburn alumni and friends. 

The recruit assembly area is 3,065 square feet and serves as 
a reception area. This room provides a comfortable atmosphere 
with direct connections to the field and the stadium. The room 
houses graphics of past Auburn games and two large screen pro- 
jection televisions which provide closed-circuit televised action of 
the game. A prep kitchen and restroom facilities also support the 
functions for this area. During the off-season, the room supports 
other events tied to athletics. 


Jordan-Hare Stadium Murals 


Prior to the 2011 season, 10 large murals that are located 
on the east side exterior of Jordan-Hare Stadium were updated. 
Designed by Athletics Art Director Tyler Trout, there is a mural 
for each of Auburn’s three Heisman Trophy winners, one panel 
each for the Tigers’ four perfect seasons (1957, 1993, 2004, 2010), 
a mural for Auburn’s two national champion teams (1957, 2010) 
and one mural that includes the three namesakes of the stadium 
(Jordan, Hare, Dye). 

The murals were initially hung prior to the 2006 season with 
10 large murals that were designed by Pamela Welch. The murals 
were updated with more recent history which include pictures 
of early Auburn football teams and coaches, Heisman Trophy 
winners Pat Sullivan and Bo Jackson, as well as more recent his- 
tory, including pictures from Auburn’s 1993 and 2004 undefeated 
seasons. Each mural is 11’x29’ and Auburn’s football history is 
displayed in chronological order from south to north. 


Heisman Statues 

On April 14, 2012, Auburn honored Heisman Trophy win- 
ners Pat Sullivan (1971), Bo Jackson (1985) and Cam Newton 
(2010) with statues of their likeness on the entry plaza on the east 
side of Jordan-Hare Stadium. The bronze statues, which are one 
and a half times life size and each weighs over 1,900 pounds, were 
designed and sculpted by Ken Bjorge of Big Fork, Montana. 

A bust of John Heisman was also commissioned and is locat- 
ed near the statues at the east entry plaza. Heisman, for whom the 
famed trophy is named, was Auburn’s head coach from 1895-99. 
Auburn is the only school where Heisman coached that also has a 
Heisman Trophy winner. 

Planning and production for the Jackson and Sullivan statues 
began in spring of 2010. Production for the Newton statue began 
in February, 2011. 

Auburn is tied for fifth all-time with three Heisman winners.

Football Facilities 


Auburn Practice Facilities 

Auburn boasts some of the top practice facilities in the 
nation with completion in July, 2011, of a brand new state-of-the- 
art multipurpose indoor facility and renovated practice fields. 

Approved in June, 2010, by the Auburn University Board of 
Trustees construction for the project began in December, 2010, 
and was completed on July 29, 2011 by Parker Construction of 
Auburn, Ala. 

The 92,000 square-foot, $16.5 million facility has a full 100- 
yard field with newly developed astro-turf and is fully air con- 
ditioned. The building is 390 feet by 240 feet and is 72 feet at its 
highest point. 

The outdoor fields include a 100-yard field and a 75-yard 
field with new drainage and irrigation systems. Five permanent 
pre-wired towers for filming practice were also installed. 

The facility is located adjacent to the current football prac- 
tice fields behind the Auburn Athletic Complex. It runs east and 
west along Samford Avenue and connects with the Charlotte G. 
Lowder Student-Athlete Development Center and the James T. 
Tatum Jr. Strength and Conditioning Center. 


James T. Tatum Strength & Conditioning Center 


Auburn football players benefit from the direction of one of 
the finest strength and conditioning staffs in the country. Head 
strength coach Ryan Russell has implemented an extensive pro- 
gram for Auburn’s football team which has improved the team’s 
overall strength and conditioning levels. 

The James T. Tatum, Jr., Strength and Conditioning Center 
stands as a testament to Auburn’s commitment to providing state- 
of-the-art training facilities for its student-athletes. The center, 
which opened in January 2002, encompasses more than 14,000 
square feet and is triple the size of the previous facility. 

The first floor of the two-story center houses 24 power 
stations, which contain the majority of the equipment used by 
student-athletes during workouts and leads to effective and 
time-efficient training. Also, there are several upper and lower 
body selectorized machines around the perimeter of the main 
floor. The second floor contains various machines, medicine 
balls, aerobic equipment and an open exercise area for additional 
overall strength and conditioning development of Auburn’s 
student-athletes. 

Adjacent to the weight room is a 20-yard astroturf hill, set at 
45 degrees, which is used for speed and endurance conditioning. 
The center also houses the strength and conditioning coaches’ 
offices. 

With the completion of the adjacent Indoor Practice Facility 
in July 2011, another 1,500 square feet were added to the weight 
room bringing the size of the facility to 15,382 square feet. 

The center is named for James T. Tatum, Jr., who served 16 
years as a member of the Board of Trustees. Dr. Tatum believed 
strongly and devoutly in Cliff Hare’s philosophy that “Athletics 
Makes Men Strong, Study Makes Men Wise and Character 
Makes Men Great.” His support of Auburn’s teams and programs 
throughout the years strongly illustrated that fact. 


The center was dedicated in his memory on April 6, 2002. 

Designed by The Butner and Associates Architectural Group, 
the facility was built by Bailey Harris Construction Corporation 
at a cost of $2.7 million. 


Auburn Athletic Training 


Auburn’s Athletic Training Room provides expert health 
care for student-athletes. Auburn student-athletes have access to 
the latest in sports medicine equipment and rehabilitation equip- 
ment. 

In June of 2008, Auburn completed a $1.7 million project 
for the football facilites in the Auburn Athletics Complex that 
included renovation of the Auburn Athletic Training Room. 
The hydro-therapy area, an aquatic therapy system for reha- 
bilitation and training of injuries, was improved to include a 
HydroWorx 600 Series therapy pool, a PolarPlunge pool and two 
ThermalPlunge pools. The water in the tanks can be maintained 
at any temperature. 

Auburn Sports Medicine has a staff of 20 certified athletic 
trainers, six of whom work directly with football daily. Their 
experience and expertise contribute to keeping the Tigers healthy 
and protected during and after their seasons. 


Strength & Rehabilitation Center 


Auburn student-athletes enjoy the finest amenities with 
the $3.5 million, 6,288 square-foot Strength and Rehabilitation 
Center that opened in January 2004. 

The first floor of the state-of-the-art facility features a weight 
room and locker rooms utilized by many Auburn University 
teams. The second floor houses clinical offices for the Alabama 
Sports Medicine and Orthopaedic Center physicians, research 
space for the American Sports Medicine Institute, an x-ray suite 
and Plainsman Park Physical Therapy. 

Plainsman Park Physical Therapy, under the direction of David 
Walsh, ATC, PT, is a service of Auburn University created to meet 
the rehab needs of Auburn University students and athletes as well as 
nationally-acclaimed professional athletes. 

The entire building is dedicated to primarily addressing the 
medical and rehabilitative needs of all of Auburn University’s 
student-athletes.

Uniquely Auburn 


Here’s a quick look at what makes the Auburn football phenomena uniquely 
“Auburn.” 


All-America x 11 
Jimmy “Red” Phillips made 11 All-America teams in 1957 before becoming an 
All-Pro with the Los Angeles Rams and Minnesota Vikings and leading the NFL 
in receiving in 1961. 


Aubie 


Auburn’s award-winning mascot, celebrating his 35th year in 2012-13, is a favorite 
for Tiger fans, both young and old. On the job since 1979, Aubie’s existence began 
as a cartoon character drawn by Birmingham Post-Herald artist Phil Neel in 1959 
for the Oct. 3, football game program. 


Bacardi Bowl 

Auburn’s first bowl trip and the only bowl game to ever be played outside the 
United States. Auburn and Villanova battled to a 7-7 tie in Havana, Cuba on New 
Year’s day in 1937. Billy Hitchcock scored the Tigers’ only touchdown of the game 
ona 40-yard run. 


BCS National Champions 

The 2010 Auburn football team won the school’s first BCS National 
Championship and the program’s first national title since 1957. Led by 
Heisman Trophy winner Cam Newton, Lombardi Trophy winner Nick Fairley 
and veteran senior class, the Tigers went a perfect 14-0 en route to BCS National 
Championship over Oregon, 22-19, on January 11, 2011, in Glendale, Arizona. 
Senior placekicker Wes Byrum booted a 19-yard field goal as time expired, cap- 
ping a 73-yard drive, to win the title for the Tigers. 


Beard, Jeff 


Garland Washington “Jeff” Beard could generally be considered the father of mod- 
ern Auburn athletics. Serving as athletic director from 1951 through 1972, Beard 
hired legendary coach Ralph “Shug” Jordan, increased the capacity of what is now 
Jordan-Hare Stadium from 21,500 to 61,500 seats and is responsible for bringing 
Auburn’s football games with Georgia Tech, Georgia and Tennessee to campus. 
His tenure also produced the basketball coliseum now named in his honor, the 
Wilbur Hutsell Track and Field complex and Sewell Hall. Beard is one of only six 
Auburn athletic directors who didn’t serve as head football coach. 


Bo over the top 

The climax to a 23-22 Auburn victory over Alabama in 1982 which broke a nine- 
year losing skid to the Crimson Tide. Bo Jackson’s 1-yard leap over the Alabama 
goal line capped a 66-yard drive and set the stage for what Auburn people consider 


,« 


the Tigers’ “coming out” party in the 1980s. 


December 2, 1989 


Alabama came to Auburn’s Jordan-Hare Stadium for the first time in the history of 
the rivalry. Prior to that, all games in the series had been played at Birmingham’s 
Legion Field since the series was resumed in 1948. A 30-20 Auburn victory settled 
the score of the game, but the cross-state journey for the Tide settled a score which 
had brewed for nearly a century in the hearts of Auburn people. Alabama coach 
Ray Perkins once said “it won’t happen.” On Dec. 2, 1989, it did. 


The Deep South’s Oldest Rivalry 
Auburn and Georgia. It began on Feb. 20, 1892 at Piedmont Park in Atlanta. Since 
1898 the Tigers and the Bulldogs have played every year, 113 meetings total, with 
the exception of 1943, when Auburn didn’t field a team due to World War II. To 
date, Auburn leads the series 54-53-8. 


Donahue, Mike 

“Tron” Mike Donahue won 99 games in two different stints as Auburn’s head coach, 
tying him with Pat Dye for second on the all-time Auburn victories list. Donahue’s 
1913 Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association championship team not only 
went undefeated at 8-0, but did not allow a single point to be scored on them. On the 
flip side, his 1920 team averaged 42.5 points per game, despite being shut out twice. 
During his tenure, 38 players were named as All-Southern Conference. Donahue also 
served as the basketball, baseball and track coach as well athletic director. 


Don’t Make Us Go There 


For years some of Auburn’s chief rivals - Georgia, Tennessee, Georgia Tech and 
Alabama - never made it to The Plains. Auburn’s “home” games with those schools 
were played in Montgomery, Mobile, Columbus and Birmingham. Athletic 
Director Jeff Beard changed all that starting in 1960. The Auburn-Georgia game 
was played in Columbus, Athens, Atlanta, Macon or Savannah from 1892 through 
1959. In 1960 the Bulldogs finally came to Auburn and lost, 9-6. From 1906 until 
1970 Auburn and Georgia Tech played in either Atlanta or Birmingham - 53 
straight times in Atlanta - before the Yellow Jackets finally gave in and came to 
Auburn to lose 31-7. In a series that began in 1900, Tennessee finally played at 
Auburn in 1974, losing 21-0. In 1989, cross-state rival Alabama made the trip and 
left with a 30-20 defeat and dreams of an undefeated season ended. 


Dye, Pat 

Patrick Fain Dye won 99 games and four Southeastern Conference championships 
in 12 years as Auburn’s head coach, but perhaps he will be remembered most for 
bringing Auburn’s “home” game with Alabama to the Auburn campus on Dec. 2, 
1989, a 30-20 Tiger victory. He also fielded such superstars as Bo Jackson, Kurt 
Crain and Tracy Rocker. Under his leadership as athletic director, Auburn football 
facilities were elevated to some of the finest in the nation with additions to Jordan- 
Hare Stadium increasing the seating capacity to 85,214 and 70 luxury suites. In 
2005, Jordan-Hare’s field was named in his honor. 


Eleven and Ohhhhh!!!!! 


In 1993, first-year coach Terry Bowden directed Auburn to its first undefeated, 
11-win season while the Tigers suffered through the first year of NCAA imposed 
sanctions which kept AU off television and out of the bowl scene. The 11 wins 
in 1993 were the opening act of a 20-game winning streak which would set the 
Auburn record for consecutive victories. 


The Entrance 
The Auburn team began a new tradition in 2000, entering the field from the 
middle of the south end zone through a cloud of smoke. 


Fairley, Nick 

Mobile, Ala., native Nick Fairley became Auburn’s second Lombardi Trophy 
winner when he won the award in 2010. He was coached by Lombardi winner 
and former Tiger Tracy Rocker, becoming the first player to win the award 
and be coached by a winner of the award. A consensus All-American in 2010, 
Fairley finished the season with 24.0 tackles for loss and 11.5 quarterback sacks, 
both school single-season marks. 


Final Roll 

As part of A-Day 2013, Auburn University and the City of Auburn hosted the 
“Final Roll” of Toomer’s Corner. The original trees were removed during the sum- 
mer of 2013 and replaced temporarily by wires. New trees will be transplanted and 
are expected to be ready in time for the 2014 season.

Uniquely Auburn 


Four in The First 


Auburn set a Southeastern Conference record when four Tigers were selected in the 
first round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Ronnie Brown went second overall to Miami, 
Carnell Williams fifth to Tampa Bay, Carlos Rogers ninth to Washington and Jason 
Campbell 25th to the Redskins. Auburn became just the 11th school to have four 
players selected in the first round of the same draft. Meanwhile, the backfield of 
Brown, Campbell and Williams became the first to all be selected in the first round 
in the same year. 


Hare, Cliff 
Cliff Hare was a member of Auburn’s first football team who went on to serve 
as chair of the Auburn Faculty Athletic Committee. Auburn’s football stadium is 
named for the longtime professor and dean of the School of Chemistry. He served 
as president of the Southern Conference before the formation of the Southeastern 
Conference. 


Heisman, John 

The legendary coach for which college football’s top honor is named coached at 
Auburn from 1895-99, posting a 12-4-2 record. Auburn is the only school where 
John Heisman coached to have a Heisman Trophy winner. Heisman left Auburn 
for Clemson and then Georgia Tech, where he lost 10 of 15 meetings with Auburn. 


Heisman Statues 

Three statues of Auburn Heisman Trophy winners Pat Sullivan, Bo Jackson 
and Cam Newton are located at the entry plaza on the east side of Jordan-Hare 
Stadium. The bronze statues, which are one and a half times life size and each 
weighs over 1,900 pounds, were designed and sculpted by Ken Bjorge of Big Fork, 
Montana. A bust of John Heisman was also commissioned and is located near the 
statues at the east entry plaza. The statues were dedicated in a ceremony on April 
14, 2012. 


Heisman Trophy 
Auburn has three. Pat Sullivan won the coveted award in 1971. Bo Jackson did the 
same in 1985. Cam Newton gave the program its third Heisman in 2010. 


Jordan, Ralph 

Over the years no name has been more synonymous with Auburn football than 
Ralph “Shug” Jordan. The all-time winningest football coach at Auburn, Jordan 
won 176 games over a 25-year career on The Plains. A four-time Southeastern 
Conference coach of the year, he was also named national coach of the year in 
1957 after leading Auburn to its first football outright national championship. 


Jordan-Hare Stadium 

Auburn’s showcase football stadium which seats 87,451 with 70 luxury suites 
located between the lower level and upper deck on the East side of the stadium. 
The stadium was dedicated Nov. 30, 1939, with 7,500 seats that are now incor- 
porated into the West stands. Ten years later 14,000 more seats were added and 
the stadium was named Cliff Hare Stadium, although only 12 home games were 
played there over that 10-year span. Additional seats were added in 1955, 1960 and 
1970. The West upper deck was completed in 1980 and the East upper deck and 
suites were finished for the 1987 season. The facility was renamed Jordan-Hare 
Stadium in 1973. 


Kick It Again 

In September 2004, on its way to a perfect 13-0 season, Auburn played host to 
LSU just days after Hurricane Ivan swept through Alabama. Trailing 9-3, the 
game came to a climax when Jason Campbell connected with Courtney Taylor 
with 1:14 to play, tying the score 9-9. The ensuing extra point was missed, but 
an LSU penalty allowed for another attempt. John Vaughn promptly nailed the 
second chance, giving the Tigers the 10-9 advantage and ensuring Auburn’s 
place in the record books. 


Lupton, Frank 

Frank Lupton, a halfback and captain of the 1892 football squad, scored the first 
touchdown and kicked the first conversion in Auburn football history in a 10-0 
Auburn victory over Georgia on Feb. 20, 1892. 


Newton, Cam 

Perhaps one of the greatest single-season performances by a college football 
player was displayed by Cam Newton in 2010. The consensus national player 
of the year that season, Newton helped lead the Tigers to the BCS Natioanal 
Championship. For his efforts, Newton won the Heisman Trophy, Davey 
O’Brien Award, Maxwell Award and the Manning Award. The first SEC player 
to throw for 2,000 yards and rush for 1,000 in a single season, Newton was 
responsible for 51 touchdowns that season and set numerous school records. 
He threw for 2,854 yards and 30 touchdowns, while rushing for 1,473 yards 
and 20 TDs. 


Nicknames 

There is only one ... Tigers. There is no such thing as an Auburn War Eagle, an 
Auburn Plainsman or Plainsmen or an Auburn Lady Tiger. It is simply Tigers. 
“War Eagle” is a battle cry and The Plainsman is the name of Auburn’s student 
newspaper. 


Nix-to- Sanders 

With starting quarterback Stan White lying in pain on the turf of Jordan-Hare 
Stadium and Auburn’s undefeated season hanging in the balance against Alabama 
in 1993, sophomore quarterback Patrick Nix was summoned to the huddle to face 
a 4th-and-15 at the Alabama 35-yard line with Auburn trailing 14-5 and 6:09 left 
in the third quarter. Offensive coordinator Tommy Bowden relayed the call to the 
sidelines and “278Z Takeoff” would become a part of Auburn football lore. Nix, 
without a chance to loosen up, hung the ball up and receiver Frank Sanders pulled 
it down for a touchdown. Auburn went on to win 22-14. 


Nova 

The name of Auburn’s golden eagle mascot. Nova is War Eagle VII and was intro- 
duced during halftime of Auburn’s game against Georgia in 2006. Nova replaced 
Tiger, which served as War Eagle VI for 20 years, from 1986-2006. 


Outland Trophy 

Auburn players have won two. Zeke Smith won the first in 1958, Tracy Rocker 
the second in 1988. Rocker made it a clean sweep in 1988 by also winning the 
Lombardi Award. 


Pat Dye Field 


The turf at Jordan-Hare Stadium was officially named after Pat Dye, Auburn’s 
Hall of Fame coach and athletics director, prior to the 2005 Iron Bowl. The Tigers 
posted a 99-39-4 record in 12 seasons under Dye from 1981-92, and won four 
SEC championships. Auburn’s home games are now played at Pat Dye Field at 
Jordan-Hare Stadium. 


Perfect in 2004 

It began with a 31-0 win over Louisiana-Monroe and culminated with a 16-13 vic- 
tory over Virginia Tech in the NOKIA Sugar Bowl. The 2004 season will be forever 
known as Auburn’s Perfect Season, a year in which the Tigers defeated four top 10 
teams en route to a No. 2 national finish, their highest since ending the season No. 
1 in 1957. Auburn rode a high-powered offense and one of the nation’s top defenses 
to its sixth-ever Southeastern Conference Championship and third straight bowl 
victory. 


7 | AUBURN FOOTBALL HISTORY & RECORDS| 7 


Uniquely Auburn 


“Phantom of Union Springs” 

Jimmy Hitchcock, a Union Springs, Ala., native, was Auburn’s first football All- 
American. The “Phantom of Union Springs” was also a baseball All-American 
who later returned to coach and hold a position on the Auburn University Board 
of Trustees. He earned his nickname, The Phantom, from his speed and ability to 
elude defenders on the football field. Auburn’s baseball facility, Hitchcock Field at 
Plainsman Park, is named in honor of Jimmy and Billy Hitchcock, brothers who 
made a lasting impact on Auburn. 


Picked off 


Those who witnessed Auburn’s 30-26 victory over LSU in 1994 saw one of the 
most bizarre finishes ever to a college football game. With LSU leading 23-9 
going into the fourth quarter, Auburn safety Ken Alvis picked off an LSU pass 
and rambled 42 yards for a touchdown. Before the final horn sounded Fred Smith 
followed suit for 32 yards and a score, then Brian Robinson returned yet another 
pickoff for a 41-yard TD. In all, the Tigers intercepted five LSU passes in the fourth 
quarter to keep a 14-game winning streak alive. 


Piedmont Park 

The site of the first Auburn football game on Feb. 20, 1892, in Atlanta. Auburn 
defeated Georgia, 10-0, in that game, kicking off the oldest rivalry in the South. 
The Auburn and Georgia athletic departments held a joint ceremony at Piedmont 
Park on February 20, 1992, to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of football 
at both universities. 


Petrie, Dr. George 

Dr. George Petrie, a faculty member in the Agricultural and Mechanical College 
in 1892, organized and was the coach of Auburn’s first football team. One of 
Auburn’s academic buildings, Petrie Hall, was named in his honor. 


“Punt Bama Punt” 

Maybe the most famous and easily the most talked about Auburn-Alabama 
football game. Trailing 16-0 heading into the fourth quarter in the 1972 con- 
test, Auburn’s Gardner Jett made a field goal. Then lightning struck - twice. Bill 
Newton blocked an Alabama punt and David Langner returned it 25 yards for 
an Auburn touchdown. Three minutes later Newton blocked another punt and 
Langner ran 20 yards for the score. The Tigers defeated the Tide 17-16. 


Retired Jerseys 

There are only three at Auburn: Pat Sullivan’s 7, Terry Beasley’s 88 and Bo 
Jackson’s 34. Sullivan and Beasley’s jerseys were retired following Sullivan’s 1971 
Heisman Trophy season and Jackson’s jersey was retired as part of Auburn’s foot- 
ball centennial celebration in 1992. 


Singing in the Rain 

The start of games in two consecutive weeks at Jordan-Hare Stadium were delayed 
by severe weather early in the 2010 season. On Sept. 19, during a delay prior to 
the Auburn-West Virginia game, a torrential downpour couldn’t keep Auburn’s 
student section from continuing to sing and cheer while staying at their seats 
throughout the delay. Once the storm passed and the game began, the pumped up 
crowd helped Auburn to a 41-30 victory. Seven days later, another severe storm 
dealyed the start of the Auburn-Ball State game, which Auburn went on to win 
54-30. 


Sullivan-to-Beasley 

Auburn’s most prolific passing combination. From 1969 to 1971 Pat Sullivan and 
Terry Beasley connected for more than 2,500 passing yards and nearly 30 touch- 
downs. Thirty-seven years after the end of their careers, both Sullivan and Beasley 
still hold Auburn’s career passing and receiving touchdown records, respectively. 


Thorpe Award 

Carlos Rogers won the award in 2004 after finishing with two interceptions, 10 
pass breakups and 47 tackles. The award is given annually to the nation’s top col- 
legiate defensive back. 


Tiger Walk 

An Auburn tradition which began in the early 1960s when Auburn players would 
walk from Sewell Hall to the football stadium and fans would line Donahue Drive 
to wish them well. Over the years Tiger Walk has grown into a major part of game 
day at Auburn, so much so that it is listed on the players’ game weekend itinerary. 
The largest Tiger Walk is believed to have taken place prior to the 1989 Alabama 
game when more than 20,000 well wishers lined the street. Every Tiger Walk prior 
to home games draws thousands, and, over the last couple of years the Tiger Walk 
has become a standard as Auburn football players enter stadiums on the road. 
Tiger Walk is two hours before kickoff for every game. 


Toomer’s Corner 

The center of town where the Auburn University campus meets the City of 
Auburn. Toomer’s Corner, where College Street intersects Magnolia Avenue, has 
long been the gathering place for Auburn athletic celebrations. After any football 
win, and significant victories in other sports, Auburn students and citizens alike 
join forces to “roll” the trees (and anything else that doesn’t move) at Toomer’s 
Corner with toilet tissue. Celebrations after significant football victories can go 
on for hours and leave the heart of town looking like a blizzard passed through. 
The trees were removed in 2013 and will be replaced in time for the 2014 season. 


Toomer’s Drug Store 

An Auburn landmark at the corner of College and Magnolia reputed to serve the 
best lemonade in the country. It is Auburn legend that John Heisman used to 
frequent Toomer’s Drugs for a taste of the now-famous lemonade. 


Walk-ons 


Auburn has a long and storied past of football walk-ons who have gone on to 
very successful football careers. One success story belongs to former three-time 
All-Pro and Defensive MVP (1995) defensive end Kevin Greene. After being cut 
once, Greene walked on at Auburn a second time and made the team. He went 
on to play 15 seasons in the NFL and is a two-time finalist for the Pro Football 
Hall of Fame. 


“War Eagle” 

Auburn’s battle cry, not Auburn’s nickname. There are several legends concerning 
the origin of the War Eagle battle cry, dating back to 1864 and the Civil War at the 
Battle of the Wilderness in Virginia. 


8 | AUBURN FOOTBALL HISTORY & RECORDS| 8 


The Fable of War Eagle 


According to legend, football and the cry of “War Eagle” came to 
Auburn the same day. 

It was Feb. 20, 1892, the day Auburn and Georgia met in the first game 
of the longest continuous football rivalry in the Deep South. 

The story actually began before that. That first Auburn-Georgia game 
was only the culmination. It began in 1864 at the Battle of the Wilderness 
in Virginia. 

An Auburn student had gone off to fight with Robert E. Lee and the 
Confederate troops. He was with them on the worst day of the long and 
fierce battle. 

He was wounded, and when the armies retreated to their respective 
lines, he was left on the battlefield for dead. When he regained conscious- 
ness, there were only two living things as far as he could see, himself and 
a baby eagle. 

Brought together by their common bond of misery, the soldier took 
the wounded bird with him and nursed him back to health. When he 
returned to Auburn after the war, the eagle came with him. 

The student-turned-soldier came back to Auburn and ultimately 
became a member of the faculty. He was there that day in Atlanta’s 
Piedmont Park when Auburn and Georgia met in what would now be 
called “The Game of the Century.” As usual, the eagle—called War Eagle 
because of the circumstances under which he was found—was there with 
him. 

When Auburn scored the first touchdown the old eagle broke free 
from its master and began to soar above the field. Auburn people looked 
skyward, saw the familiar figure, and shouted “War Eagle.” 

At the end of the game which Auburn won 10-0, the old eagle col- 
lapsed and died, presumably having given his all in pursuit of victory for 
Auburn. War Eagle’s body may have died that day, but his spirit lives 
forever in the hearts of Auburn people who love to stand and shout “War- 
r-r-r-r Eagle” long into the night following an Auburn victory. 

The facts of this legend cannot be authenticated, but it makes a good 
story and is the one most used to describe how the “War Eagle” battle cry 
became associated with Auburn teams. 

Auburn teams are known as “The Auburn Tigers,” but the cry of 
Auburn faithful is ever the same: “War-r-r-r-r Eagle!” 

Nova, War Eagle VII, was formally introduced as Auburn’s newest 
symbol in November 2006. Hatched at the Montgomery Zoo in 1999, 
Nova, a male Golden Eagle, came to Auburn in 2000 and flew for the first 
time as Auburn took on Kentucky in 2004. 

War Eagle V, which had represented Auburn for five seasons, died just 
days prior to the 1986 season-opener. Following a nationwide search for 
the perfect eagle, War Eagle VI was located at Land Between the Lakes, 
Ky. The female golden eagle, Tiger, underwent numerous tests and con- 
ditioning programs at the Auburn Vet School before making its debut at 
the Georgia game on Nov. 15, 1986 in Auburn. 


Editor’s Note: Jim Phillips, former Plainsman editor, wrote this version of 
the fable of War Eagle in the late 1950s. 


Auburn Nickname Explanation 


Auburn’s nickname is the TIGERS. 

Auburn’s battle cry is “WAR EAGLE!” 

Through the years, these two Auburn terms have often been used 
interchangeably and incorrectly. There are hats and T-shirts with 
Auburn War Eagles on them. Even the news media has been known to 
refer to an Auburn team as the War Eagles or to an Auburn player as a 
War Eagle. 

In fact, when the Tigers play a game on the road, there is often an 
article written in the local paper wondering why Auburn has three 
nicknames - the Auburn Tigers, the Auburn War Eagles and the 
Auburn Plainsmen. 

To set the record straight, Auburn has only one nickname - the 
Auburn Tigers. 

“War Eagle” is a battle cry, used by Auburn fans in the same manner 
Alabama fans yell “Roll Tide!” and Arkansas fans yell “Sooie Pig!” You 
never hear Alabama referred to as the Alabama Roll Tides or Arkansas 
as the Arkansas Sooie Pigs, and to call Auburn teams the Auburn War 
Eagles would be just as incorrect. The battle cry “War Eagle” should 
never have an “s” on the end of it. 

The nickname “Tigers” comes from a line in Oliver Goldsmith’s 
poem, “The Deserted Village,” published in May 1770, “where crouch- 
ing tigers wait their hapless prey...” 

The term “Plainsmen” comes from a line in that same Goldsmith 
poem, “Sweet Auburn, loveliest (sic) village of the plain...” Since 
Auburn athletes were, in the early days, men from the Plains, it 
was only natural for newspaper headline writers to shorten that to 
“Plainsmen.” 

It may be confusing to an outsider, but to Auburn people, it is very 
simple. That’s why War Eagle VII, Auburn’s golden eagle symbol, is 
named Nova! 


War Eagle (Fight Song) 


War ... Eagle, fly down the field, Ever to conquer, never to yield 
War ... Eagle fearless and true. Fight on, you orange and blue. 
Go! Go! Go! 

On to vic’try, strike up the band, 

Give ’em hell, give ’em hell. 

Stand up and yell, Hey! War ... Eagle, win for Auburn, 

Power of Dixie Land!

Auburn's Mascot “Aubie” 


Aubie, Auburn’s costumed Tiger mascot, is in his 35th year as a spirit 
leader and goodwill ambassador for Auburn University. 

A popular character among Auburn fans and one of the more ani- 
mated mascots in the country, Aubie has been on the job since 1979. 

Aubie’s existence began as a cartoon character that first appeared on 
the Auburn/Hardin-Simmons football program cover on Oct. 3, 1959. 
Birmingham Post-Herald artist Phil Neel created the cartoon Tiger who 
continued to adorn Auburn program covers for 18 years. 

Aubie’s look changed through the years. In 1962, he began to stand 
upright and the next year, 1963, wore clothes for the first time—a blue 
tie and straw hat. 

Aubie’s appearances on game programs proved to be somewhat of a 
good luck charm for Coach Ralph “Shug” Jordan’s teams. The Tigers 
were victorious in the first nine games he graced the cover and, in his 
first six years, Auburn posted a 23-2-1 home record. Auburn’s home 
record during the 18 years Aubie served as cover tiger was 63-16-2. 

Aubie’s last appearance on the game program cover was Oct. 23, 
1976, when Auburn downed Florida State, 31-19, but Aubie returned to 
Auburn’s cover against Alabama on Nov. 30, 1991, Auburn’s last home 
game at Legion Field. 

In 1979, Aubie came to life at the Southeastern Conference basket- 
ball tournament. James Lloyd, Auburn spirit director for the Student 
Government Association, with help from the Alumni Association, 
contacted Brooks-Van Horn Costumes in New York, N.Y. The com- 
pany was provided with copies of the 1961 Auburn-Alabama and 1962 
Auburn-Georgia Tech game programs to use for reference in creating 
a costume of the cartoon character. The firm, which also provided 
costumes for Walt Disney, designed and produced a Tiger costume for 
$1,350. Individual contributions from various Auburn clubs, alumni and 
friends helped pay for the first costume. 

Aubie proudly marched into the Birmingham-Jefferson Civic Center 
on Feb. 28, 1979, and helped lead first-year Auburn coach Sonny Smith’s 
team to an upset of Vanderbilt. The following day, Aubie returned to 
the arena and the Tigers surprised Georgia in the longest game in SEC 
tournament history, four overtimes. Before the weekend was complete, 
Aubie helped lead the ninth-place team in the regular season to the 
semifinals of the tournament. 

Aubie was selected as the nation’s No. 1 college mascot in 1990-91 by 
the Universal Cheerleader Association with Chris Wood, Mike Jernigan 
and Rob Thomson as the Friends of Aubie. And the 1994-95 Friends of 
Aubie, Trey Humphreys, Mike Murphy, and Billy Stephens, received No. 
1 college mascot again. In 1995-96, the Friends of Aubie, Billy Stephens 
(head Aubie) of Metarie, La., along with Mike Griffin and Josh Agerton, 
both of Auburn, claimed the title again. In 1998-99, the Friends of Aubie, 
J.G. Carver (head Aubie) of Huntsville, Eric Krausse of Chesterfield, Va., 
and Brannon McKim of Montgomery captured Auburn’s fourth nation- 
al championship. Aubie’s fifth national championship was awarded in 
2002-03, with Taylor Griswold (head Aubie) from Montgomery, Jeremy 
Legg from Franklin, Tenn., and Trey Mock from Marietta, Ga., as the 
Friends of Aubie. The most recent championship was brought home in 
2005-06 by Friends of Aubie Evan Thomas, (head Aubie) from Dothan, 
David Smith from Ozark and Chris Delvizis from Brentwood, Tenn. 

Along with Aubie’s six national championships he was the first colle- 
giate mascot inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame. Aubie received this 
honor at an induction ceremony held in Philadelphia on Aug. 15, 2006, 
with Chris Delvizis (Head Aubie) of Brentwood, Tenn., Justin Shugart of 
Fairhope and Shelton Tate of Spartanburg, S.C., as the Friends of Aubie.

The Alma Mater 


On the rolling plains of Dixie 
’Neath its sun-kissed sky, 
Proudly stands, our Alma Mater 
Banners high. 


To thy name we'll sing thy praise, 
From hearts that love so true, 
And pledge to thee our 

Loyalty and ages through. 


We hail thee, Auburn, and we vow 
To work for thy just fame, 

And hold in memory as we do now 
Thy cherished name. 


Hear thy student voices swelling, 
Echoes strong and clear, 

Adding laurels to thy fame 
Enshrined so dear. 


From thy hallowed halls we'll part, 
And bid thee sad adieu; 

Thy sacred trust we'll bear with us 
The ages through. 


We hail thee, Auburn, and we vow 
To work for thy just fame, 

And hold in memory as we do now 
Thy cherished name.

The Auburn Creed 


I believe that this is a practical world and that I can count only on what I earn. 
Therefore, I believe in work, hard work. 
I believe in education, which gives me the knowledge to work wisely and trains 
my mind and my hands to work skillfully. 
I believe in honesty and truthfulness, without which I cannot win the respect and 


confidence of my fellowmen. 


I believe in a sound mind, in a sound body and a spirit that is not afraid, and in 
clean sports that develop these qualities. 
I believe in obedience to law because it protects the rights of all. 


I believe in the human touch, which cultivates sympathy with my fellowmen and 
mutual helpfulness and brings happiness for all. 

I believe in my Country, because it is a land of freedom and because it is my own 
home, and that I can best serve that country by “doing justly, loving mercy, 
and walking humbly with my God.” 

And because Auburn men and women believe in these things, I believe in 
Auburn and love it. 


—George Petrie 
Auburn’s First Football Coach

Auburn's Symbol 


Nova/Tiger/ Spirit --——— 

For hi r years, eagles have been associated with Auburn 
University’s football program. From a static presence on the sidelines to 
rousing flights over the field, WAR EAGLE has become an Auburn icon. 

The role of Auburn University’s eagles is to promote wildlife con- 
servation as a part of the education initiatives of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife 
Service and the College of Veterinary Medicine’s Southeastern Raptor 
Center. The USF&WS permits the Raptor Center to house eagles and use 
them on hundreds of educational presentations each year - including 
Auburn’s home football games. 

Currently, three flighted eagles and numerous other non-releasable 
raptors are used for these educational programs. Eagles stir emotions 
in many people as they have come to symbolize strength, power and 
courage as well as other important values such as freedom, American 
heritage and the preservation of our environment. Golden Eagles Tiger 
(War Eagle VI), Nova (War Eagle VII) and Spirit (a Bald Eagle) are the 
eagles who have inspired football fans with their graceful flights over 
Jordan- Hare Stadium. 

Tiger was hatched in captivity in 1980 and came to live at Auburn 
University in 1986. A frequent sideline fixture, she made her first free 
flight at the Wyoming game on Aug. 31, 2000. Since then, she has flown 
prior to many games as well as at educational programs and the 2002 
Winter Olympics. 

At the Georgia game in November 2006, Tiger made her last stadi- 
um flight and is now “retired.” A halftime ceremony at that game recog- 
nized her contributions to the Auburn community and to the USF&WS 
conservation mission. Golden Eagle Nova was then inaugurated as War 
Eagle VIL. 

Tiger continues to appear at some educational presentations and is 
doing well despite a diagnosis of skin cancer in 2006. Now 33, Tiger has 
already outlived the average lifespan for a Golden Eagle, and underwent 
successful cataract surgery in December, 2012. 

Although not titled War Eagle VI until November 2006, Nova’s 
first pre-game flight was at the Kentucky game in 2004. Nova was 
hatched in 1999 at the Montgomery Zoo and came to Auburn in 2000. 
Nova looks similar to Tiger but has a smaller stature because he is a 
male. Like Tiger, Nova appears in scores of educational programs every 
year. 

Spirit is the only Bald Eagle that has ever flown in Jordan-Hare 
Stadium; his first game flight was in 2001. You can recognize Spirit soar- 
ing before kickoff because unlike the Golden Eagles, Spirit has a bright 
white head and tail feathers. In 1995, Spirit was discovered as an injured 
fledgling in Florida. 

He came to Auburn in 1998 and joined the educational collection 
at the Raptor Center. His damaged beak makes him non-releasable. Bald 
Eagles are found throughout Alabama and wild ones can sometimes be 
seen soaring in Auburn skies. 

In the 1970s, a group from Auburn’s College of Veterinary Medicine 
began an intensive effort to treat and rehabilitate injured raptors. This 
initiative led to the creation of what is now known as the Southeastern 
Raptor Center. The SRC is the oldest and only medical and surgical wild- 
life rehabilitation facility in the Southeast dedicated solely to raptors. 
SRC is supported by the College of Veterinary Medicine and is a non- 
profit organization that depends upon public and private contributions 
to accomplish its mission. 

Hundreds of educational programs for schools and other groups 
help to generate these funds. The Southeastern Raptor Center’s mission 
is to rehabilitate and release injured and orphaned raptors, educate the 
public about their role and importance, and to research raptor-related 
issues. 


At SRC, raptors are admitted with a variety of injuries and ailments. 
Many birds are rehabilitated and released. When release is not possible, 
the bird may become a permanent center resident or transfer to another 
educational facility. You can support SRC by purchasing SRC merchan- 
dise at the AU Bookstore or through SRC’s website. 

Here, you can also contribute to SRC birds through the Adopt-A- 
Raptor program. This year, SRC will have public raptor shows which will 
include an eagle flight. These presentations are at the SRC Amphitheatre 
at 4:00pm each Friday before home games. The $5 admission is payable 
at the gate.

tional program for your group, call 334-844-6943 or visit www.auburn.

Head Coach Gus Malzahn 


Gus Malzahn, who served 
as Auburn’s offensive coordina- 
tor from 2009-11, is in his first 
year as Auburn's head coach. 
Malzahn, who won the Bro- 
yles Award as the nation’s top 
assistant coach in 2010 while 
helping the Tigers to the BCS 
National Championship, re- 
turned to Auburn after serving 
as the head coach at Arkansas 
State in 2012, where he led the 
program to the Sun Belt Con- 
ference title. He was named 
Auburn’s 27th head football coach on December 4, 2012. 

Known for his innovative offensive style, Malzahn has 
made a profound impact during each of his coaching stops 
at the collegiate level: Auburn, Arkansas State, Tulsa and Ar- 
kansas. 

“Tm grateful for the opportunity to become the head 
football coach at Auburn University. It's an outstanding in- 
stitution with a storied football program that I had the plea- 
sure of experiencing first-hand for three years,’ Malzahn 
said. “I deeply appreciate the confidence that Dr. Gogue, Jay 
Jacobs and the search committee had in my ability to turn 
this program around and to bring Auburn back to national 
prominence. This is a homecoming for me, and I look for- 
ward to being reunited with the Auburn Family.” 

Last season at Arkansas State, Malzahn led the Red 
Wolves to a 9-3 record and 7-1 conference mark, including a 
seven-game winning streak. They defeated Middle Tennes- 
see, 45-0, on Dec. 1 to claim the Sun Belt championship and 
a berth in the GoDaddy.com Bowl. 

A product of Fort Smith, Ark., Malzahn’s ASU offense 
was in the top 25 nationally in nearly every offensive cat- 
egory entering the bowl game, ranking 17th in total offense 
(481.8 ypg) and 21st in scoring offense (36.4 ppg) and rush- 
ing offense (217.4 ypg). Led by record-setting quarterback 
Ryan Aplin, who was named Sun Belt Player of the Year, the 
Red Wolves’ offense was 13th nationally in passing efficiency 
(155.39 rating) and averaged 217.4 yards per game passing. 

Malzahn made an immediate impact during his tenure 
at Auburn, highlighted by a record-setting offense in 2010 
when the Tigers finished 14-0 and claimed the school’s first 
national championship since 1957. 

The 2010 Auburn offense set nine school records, in- 
cluding points in a season (577), points per game (41.2), to- 
tal yards (6,989), total offense (499.2), rushing yards (3,987), 
rushing touchdowns (41) and passing touchdowns (31). 
Malzahn’s record-setting offense in 2010 led the Southeast- 
ern Conference and finished in the top 10 nationally in six 
statistical categories. 

He coached Heisman Trophy winner Cam Newton dur-

ing the Tigers’ run to the 2010 BCS National Championship. 
Under Malzahn’s guidance, Newton had one of the best sin- 
gle-season performances at the position in college football 
history. Newton threw for 2,908 yards and 30 touchdowns, 
while rushing for 1,586 yards and 20 TDs on the ground en 
route to becoming the third Heisman winner in school his- 
tory. 

Newton, the No. 1 overall draft pick in the 2011 NFL 
Draft, also won the school’s first-ever Davey O’Brien Award 
and Manning Award, given to the nation’s top quarterback. 
He also claimed the Maxwell Award, presented annually to 
college football’s top player, while also earning Associated 
Press National Player of the Year and SEC Offensive Player 
of the Year awards. 

Newton became just the third player in FBS history to 
record 20 rushing and passing touchdowns in a single sea- 
son and the first player in SEC history to throw for 2,000 
yards and rush for 1,000 yards in a single season. 

Malzahn helped lead the Tigers to an 8-5 record in 2011,

Head Coach Gus Malzahn 


which included a victory over Virginia in the Chick-fil-A 
Bowl. The Malzahn-led Auburn offense had four players 
named to the All-SEC Team. 

Malzahn’s arrival in 2009 and style of offense marked 
a drastic turnaround from the 2008 season when Auburn 
struggled offensively. In a two-year period, the Tigers im- 
proved from a tie for 110th to seventh in the nation in scor- 
ing offense (from 17.3 to 41.2) and from 104th to seventh in 
total offense. It also took Auburn just six games in 2009 to 
score more points than it did in all 12 games in 2008. 

The striking numbers shouldn't have come as a surprise, 
as during Malzahn’s two seasons at Tulsa, his offenses there 
were also among the nation’s finest, ranking first nationally 
in total offense in 2007 and 2008. 

Tulsa's offense in 2007 established nine team school re- 
cords and 12 individual records. The Golden Hurricane also 
set nine Conference USA team records, while Tulsa quarter- 
back Paul Smith broke an NCAA record by throwing for at 
least 300 yards in 14 consecutive games. 

The 2008 Tulsa offense averaged 569.9 yards per game 
and was second nationally averaging 47.2 points per games. 

Prior to his time at Tulsa, Malzahn coached one season 
at Arkansas, as offensive coordinator, coaching Heisman 


Trophy runner-up Darren McFadden and helping the Ra- 
zorbacks finish fourth nationally in rushing offense at 228.5 
yards per game. Two of Malzahn’s first three collegiate of- 
fenses ranked in the top 10 nationally in rushing, includ- 
ing the 2008 Tulsa team and 2006 Arkansas squad. During 
Malzahn’s one season at Arkansas in 2006, the Razorbacks 
finished with a 10-4 record and were SEC Western Division 
Champions. 

Malzahn’s coaching career began in his home state of 
Arkansas at the high school level. In 14 seasons as a high 
school head coach, Malzahn led seven teams to the state 
championship game and won three titles. Malzahn coached 
two quarterbacks, Josh Floyd and current Auburn offensive 
coordinator Rhett Lashlee, who set national passing records. 
Malzahn also tutored 2005 Gatorade, Parade Magazine and 
Rivals.com National Player of the Year Mitch Mustain at 
Springdale High School. 

In July 2013, he was inducted into the Arkansas High 
School Sports Hall of Fame. 

Malzahn is married to the former Kristi Otwell and they 
are the parents of two daughters, Kylie and Kenzie.

Dameyune Craig 


CO- OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR/WIDE RECEIVERS 


Former Auburn standout quarterback Dameyune Craig serves as Au- 
burn’s co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach. Craig spent 
the past three seasons as the quarterbacks coach and recruiting coordina- 
tor at Florida State. 

Craig played quarterback at Auburn from 1994-97, where he still 
holds numerous Auburn passing records, including completions (216) 
and passing yards (3,227) in a season as well as a single-game record for 
most net yards gained (445 vs. Army in 1996; 75 rush, 370 pass). Craig, 
who led Auburn to an 18-7 mark in 25 career starts, was an exceptional 
student-athlete on and off the field, earning Academic All-SEC honors as 
a senior in 1997, 

In three seasons at Florida State, Craig helped the Seminoles to a 31-10 
record, including a 12-2 mark in 2012. FSU won the 2012 Atlantic Coast 
Conference championship and defeated Northern Illinois in the Discover 
Orange Bowl. Charged with coordinating FSU’s recruiting efforts, Craig’s 
time in that role helped produced the No. 1 and No. 2 recruiting classes 
in 2011-12. Craig was recognized as the 2012 Scout/FoxSportsNext ACC 
Recruiter of the Year as well as the Rivals.com ACC Recruiter of the Year. 
He was named one of the top 25 recruiters in the country by Rivals and 
one of the top 50 recruiters by 247Sports. 

In addition to his recruiting duties, Craig served as quarterbacks 
coach, where he helped develop E.J. Manuel and Christian Ponder. In 
passing efficiency, Ponder ranked third in the ACC and 44th nation- 
ally (135.7 passing efficiency) in 2010. Ponder and Manuel combined to 
throw for 2,905 yards while Ponder completed 61.5 percent of his passes 
and Manuel completed 69.9 percent of his passes. Ponder was a first- 
round pick of the Minnesota Vikings in the 2011 NFL Draft. 

Craig came to Florida State after a two-year run at South Alabama, 
where he directed the wide receivers for head coach Joey Jones. Craig was 
Jones’ first hire when he was charged with starting the Jaguars’ football 
program, which played its first season in 2009 and is in the process of 
becoming a Football Championship Subdivision program. 

At South Alabama, Craig was instrumental in implementing a run- 
based, spread offense that put up prolific numbers during its seven-game 
inaugural season in 2009. The Jaguars (7-0) averaged 45.9 points and 439 
yards of total offense in 2009. 

The Prichard, Ala., native began his collegiate coaching career as an 
offensive graduate assistant at LSU in 2004 and worked as a special teams 
assistant with the Miami Dolphins in 2005. Craig returned to the college 
ranks in 2006 and helped Tuskegee to a two-year record of 22-2. 

As the Golden Tigers’ quarterbacks coach he helped the program win 
a pair of SIAC titles and defeated Virginia Union in the Pioneer Bowl 
X to cap a 12-0 season in 2007 by winning the Black College National 
Championship. Craig began his coaching career at his high school alma 
mater, Blount, near Mobile, Ala., where he was an assistant coach in 2003. 

He signed as a free agent quarterback with the NFLs Carolina Pan- 
thers and appeared in six games over a four-year stretch. Craig gained 
his greatest acclaim on the field as a pro with the Scottish Claymores in 
NFL Europe, where he passed for a single-game league record 611 yards 
against Frankfort and matched another league mark with five touchdown 
passes in a game. He finished his professional playing career in 2002 with 
Indiana of the Arena Football League.

SPECIAL TEAMS/TIGHT ENDS 


After spending four seasons as Auburn’s player personnel direc-

teams coordinator and tight ends coach for the 2013 campaign. 

Fountain, a part of three ACC and one SEC Championship teams, 
was a key figure in Auburn’s administrative and recruiting efforts 
from 2009-12, helping the Tigers sign three consecutive Top 10 re- 
cruiting classes. He came to Auburn along with Coach Gene Chizik 
after spending two seasons (2007-08) on Chizik’s staff at Iowa State 
as tight ends coach and recruiting coordinator. 

Beginning his college coaching career as an offensive graduate as- 
sistant at Florida State from 1994-96, he joined the UCF staff in 1997 
as offensive guards and centers coach and co-recruiting coordina- 
tor. He spent seven seasons at UCE, becoming offensive tackles/tight 
ends coach and recruiting coordinator from 1998-2003. In 2004-05, 
he was offensive line coach at Middle Tennessee, before moving to 
Georgia Southern in 2006 as offensive line and assistant head coach. 

Some of the notable players he has coached include Ryan Flinn 
(UCF punter who spent four seasons in the NFL with the Cowboys, 
Falcons, Packers and Dolphins); Matt Prater (UCF kicker who now 
holds the franchise tag for the Denver Broncos); and Leonard John- 
son (an All-Big 12 player who set an NCAA record for kick return 
yardage at Iowa State and is now with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers). 
He also mentored Josh Harris (Auburn long snapper), who is now 
with the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons.

Rodney Garner 


ASSOCIATE HEAD COACH/RECRUITING COORDINATOR/ DEFENSIVE LINE 


Former Auburn standout player and coach Rodney Garner serves as 
associate head coach and recruiting coordinator. An all-SEC player at 
Auburn in 1988, who coached on The Plains from 1990-95, Garner will 
tutor the defensive line daily in practice. Garner spent the previous 15 
years at Georgia in a similar capacity. 

A native of Leeds, Ala., Garner was named All-SEC offensive line and 
honorable mention All-America as a senior at Auburn in 1988, captain- 
ing the team that captured the 1988 SEC Championship. As a coach for 
the Tigers, Garner served in several capacities on the Auburn staff from 
1990-95 including recruiting coordinator, tight ends coach, and assistant 
strength and conditioning coach. 

During his 15 years at Georgia, he was part of a staff that led UGA to 
117 victories, two SEC championships, five SEC Eastern Division titles, 
seven bowl victories, and six top 10 finishes in the final national polls 
including No. 2 in 2007 and No. 3 in 2002. He added the title of assistant 
head coach at Georgia in 2005 after serving as defensive line coach and 
recruiting coordinator at Georgia since 1998. 

In 2012, Garner helped the Bulldogs to an 11-2 record, the SEC Eastern 
Division title and a berth in the Capital One Bowl. The Georgia defense 
ranked 17th nationally in scoring defense, allowing just 18.7 points per 
game. He was part of the 2005 Georgia team that finished eighth nation- 
ally in scoring defense (16.4 ppg). 

The 2003 Georgia defense finished second nationally in scoring de- 
fense (14.5 ppg), fourth in total defense (276.86 ypg), sixth in passing 
defense (174.50 ypg, 1st in the SEC), while helping the Bulldogs to a di- 
visional title. Garner helped coach the 2002 Bulldog defense that finished 
first in the SEC and fourth nationally in scoring defense (15.1 ppg), first 
in the SEC in red zone defense (58.8%) and second in the SEC in rushing 
defense (114.0 ypg). The 2002 Bulldogs finished 13-1, won the SEC and 
Nokia Sugar Bowl Championships, and ranked third in the final national 
polls. 

Garner participated in the inaugural Minority Coaches Forum in 
Scottsdale, Ariz., in 2006. He was also selected as one of 10 coaches to 
participate in the 2004 NCAA Expert Coaching Academy in Indianapo- 
lis and one of only 20 chosen for the NCAA’ 2004 Advanced Coaching 
Academy in Orlando. 

At Georgia, he coached five NFL first round draft choices -- Richard 
Seymour (Patriots) and Marcus Stroud (Jaguars), both Pro Bowl starters; 
David Pollack (Bengals); Charles Grant (Saints); and Johnathan Sullivan 
(Saints). He also coached draft picks DeAngelo Tyson (7th, Ravens, ‘12), 
Geno Atkins (4th, Bengals, 10), Corvey Irvin (3rd, Panthers, ‘09), Jaruis 
Wynn (6th, Packers, 09), Kedric Golston (6th, Redskins, ‘06), Robert 
Geathers (4th, Bengals, 04), Emarlos Leroy (6th, Jaguars, 99), and free 
agents Ken Veal (Chargers, ‘04), Paul Snellings (Colts, 2000), Brandon 
Miller (Colts, 2000), Charles Johnson (Panthers, 07), Tyrone Robertson 
(Bills, 2000) and Demetric Evans (Cowboys, ‘01). 

After his playing career at Auburn, Garner had a free agent tryout with 
the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers and played with the Pittsburgh Gladia- 
tors arena football team in 1989. He began his coaching career at Auburn 
in 1990. Garner coached tight ends and offensive tackles at Tennessee in 
1997 after coaching tight ends for the Volunteers in 1996.

Tim Horton 


RUNNING BACKS 


SEC veteran Tim Horton serves as the running backs coach at Auburn, 
after six successful seasons in a similar capacity at Arkansas, where he was 
also recruiting coordinator. 

A 23-year coaching veteran, Horton was recognized by Rivals.com and 
ESPN.com as one of the nation’s top recruiters during his tenure at Ar- 
kansas and was one of just two coaches in the nation, and the only one in 
the SEC, to coach four different 1,000-yard rushers from 2007-10. Under 
his watch, Darren McFadden and Felix Jones earned All-America honors, 
while Dennis Johnson and Knile Davis were All-SEC selections. 

Hortons first class as Arkansas’ recruiting coordinator in 2008 featured 
wide receivers Joe Adams, Jarius Wright and Greg Childs, all selected in 
the fourth round of the 2012 NFL Draft. With their selections, Arkansas 
tied a draft record with three receivers taken in the same draft. It was the 
14th time in draft history, and third by an SEC team, three receivers from 
the same school were taken in the same draft and the sixth time all three 
were picked in the first four rounds. 

During his six years at Arkansas, Horton coached two of the top four 
single-season rushing performances and more than a third of the 10 Ra- 
zorbacks in school history to rush for more than 1,000 yards. 

In 2011, Horton helped the Razorbacks tie a school record with 11 wins 
and, combined with a 10-win season in 2010, marked just the third time 
in school history and first since 1988-89 the Hogs reached double-digit 
win totals in back-to-back seasons. Arkansas led the SEC in total offense 
in 2011, averaging 438.1 yards per game, for the second time in the previ- 
ous three seasons, and topped the SEC in scoring offense (36.8 ppg) in 
2011. All-SEC performer Dennis Johnson's 6.3 yards-per-carry average 
was second among the SEC’s top-10 rushers. 

Horton, who played football at Arkansas from 1986-89, returned to 
his alma mater in 2007, where he coached McFadden and Jones to All- 
America honors. McFadden was the Heisman Trophy runner-up and won 
the Doak Walker Award as the nation’s top running back in that season. 
McFadden finished the 2007 season with a school-record 1,830 yards and 
16 touchdowns. 

He came to Arkansas after taking the offensive coordinator and wide 
receivers coaching position at Air Force in January 2007. During the 2006 
season, he was the running backs coach at Kansas State, helping the Wild- 
cats earn a Texas Bowl appearance. At KSU, Horton coached two future 
NEL running backs in Thomas Clayton and James Johnson. 

Prior to Kansas State, he was at Air Force from 1999-2005, serving as 
the wide receivers coach from 1999-2004 and the running backs coach in 
2005. Horton was recognized by the Colorado Chapter of the Fellowship 
of Christian Athletes as one of its coaches of the year in 2004. 

Horton began his coaching career at Appalachian State in 1990 and 
helped guide the Mountaineers to a 67-32 record during his eight years, 
including Southern Conference championships in 1991 and 1995 and five 
appearances in the NCAA Division I-AA playoffs. The 1995 Mountain- 
eers were the first Division I team to go undefeated in North Carolina 
college football history. 

From 1990-92, Horton coached Appalachian State’s receivers and tight 
ends before taking over as the Mountaineers’ running backs coach in 
1993. He also served as the program's recruiting coordinator. 

Horton earned his bachelor’s degree in marketing management from 
Arkansas in 1990. While at Arkansas, he was a four-year letterman and 
three-year starter as a split end and punt returner under head coach Ken 
Hatfield.

players on NFL rosters. 

While defensive coordinator at South Carolina, Johnson also 
served as linebackers coach. In his final season with the Gamecocks, 
his defense ranked third nationally, allowing just 268 yards per 
game. Under Johnson, South Carolina finished in the Top 15 nation- 
ally in total defense three times. In addition to the 2011 mark of No. 
4 overall, the USC defense ranked No. 11 in scoring defense (18.4 
points per game) and second in pass defense (131.7 yards per game). 

A native of Winnsboro, S.C., Johnson logged two stints at Ala- 
bama. He was the defensive coordinator and outside linebackers 
coach from 1997-2000, helping the Crimson Tide go 10-3 in 1999 
with an SEC title and a spot in the Orange Bowl. His 1999 defense 
was No. 2 in the nation against the rush and No. 9 in total defense. 

He served as the outside linebackers coach from 1990-93, helping 
Gene Stallings’ teams go a combined 41-9, including an undefeated 
national championship year in 1992. Alabama's defense ranked No. 
1 that season against the run and in total defense. The Tide ran off a 
31-game winning streak and a 34-game unbeaten streak from 1991- 
93. The 1991 squad went 11-1. All four of those teams played in bowl 
games. 

A 1975 graduate of The Citadel with a bachelor’s degree in educa- 
tion, Johnson played defensive end for the Bulldogs. He began his

High School from 1976-78 and as both an assistant and head coach

Melvin Smith, who has nearly two decades of experience coaching 
in the Southeastern Conference, is the cornerbacks coach at Auburn. 
Smith spent the previous seven seasons coaching cornerbacks and 
the secondary at Mississippi State. 

Smith, who coached cornerbacks for MSU since 2007 after coach- 
ing the entire secondary in 2006, mentored Jonathan Banks, who 
won the 2012 Jim Thorpe Award, presented annually to the nation’s 
top defensive back. Banks was also a Walter Camp All-American and 
a first-team all-SEC selection. 

In 2012, Smith tutored a Bulldog defense that had 30 takeaways, 
which led the SEC and was 12th nationally. Darius Slay, a second- 
team All-SEC pick, tied for the league lead in interceptions with five, 
while Banks added four. 

In 2009, Smith guided a young group that led the SEC with 17 in- 
terceptions. Led by then-freshman Corey Broomfield’s six picks, the 
corners improved as the season progressed. For his efforts, Broom- 
field was named Freshman AII-SEC. In 2011, Smith continued to 
tutor Broomfield and Banks, who developed into an All-SEC per- 
former and was named a semifinalist for the Jim Thorpe Award. 

Smith returned to Mississippi State in 2006 after spending time 
at both Alabama and Texas A&M. In just his second season back 
at MSU, Smith helped the Bulldogs’ pass defense rank fourth in the 
SEC, allowing just 182.2 yards per game, sixth in pass efficiency de- 
fense (114.8). The Bulldogs improved their interception total from 
12 to 15. 

A native of Taylorsville, Miss. who grew up in Magee, Miss., 
Smith was an assistant football coach at Mississippi State for seven 
years (1995-2001), helping guide the Bulldogs through the greatest 
period in the school’s football history. In 2000, three of his four de- 
fensive backfield starters signed professional football contracts. That 
secondary intercepted 19 passes, the second-most in school history. 

The 31-year coaching veteran came back to Mississippi State fol- 
lowing three seasons at Texas A&M, where he coached the safeties. 
During his tenure in College Station, Smith helped the Aggies to 
a 7-4 regular season record in 2004 and a berth in the 2005 Cot- 
ton Bowl. Smith coached the safeties at Alabama in 2002, where the 
Crimson Tide team posted a 10-3 regular season record. 

Smith has also coached on the collegiate level in Mississippi at Ole 
Miss (1992-94) and Delta State (1990-91). He began his coaching 
career on the high school level at Greenwood (Miss.) from 1982-89.

Auburn Administration 


Jay Gogue 


Auburn University President 


Jay Gogue returned to his alma mater on 
July 16, 2007, as Auburn University’s 18th pres- 
ident. The Waycross, Ga., native earned bach- 
elor’s and master’s degrees from Auburn and a 
doctorate in horticulture from Michigan State 
University. 

During his tenure as president, the academic 
strength of Auburn’s student population has increased, a new 
research center has been established in Huntsville, Ala., a com- 
mon book program that generates a shared academic experience 
has been instituted and outreach partnerships with underserved 
schools in surrounding communities have been established. His 
leadership during a period of sharp reductions in state support for 
the university budget has protected Auburn's academic quality and 
prevented elimination of academic programs. 

Auburn is currently implementing a new five-year strategic 
plan developed at President Gogue’s direction in collaboration with 
faculty, staff, students, alumni and representatives from business, 
industry and agriculture. The plan focuses on five priorities with 
an emphasis on strengthening student success, supporting faculty 
excellence and enhancing research, scholarship and creative work. 

President Gogue was selected in 2013 for the Michigan State 
University Distinguished Alumni Award. In 2012, he was inducted 
into the Alabama Academy of Honor, a group of 100 Alabamians 
“chosen for accomplishment or service greatly benefitting or re- 
flecting great credit on the State.” 

The Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
appointed President Gogue in 2012 to a new Homeland Security 
Academic Advisory Council. He and other members advise the 
Secretary and the Department's leadership on student recruitment, 
research, campus and community preparedness and other issues. 

Before returning to Auburn, President Gogue served as presi- 
dent of New Mexico State University beginning in 2000 and, in 
2003, he was named president of the University of Houston and 
chancellor of the University of Houston System. He started his 
higher education administration career in 1986 at Clemson Uni- 
versity as vice president for research and vice president/vice pro- 
vost for agriculture and natural resources. Utah State University 
selected him as provost in 1995. 

President Gogue is a member of the Phi Kappa Phi and Gold- 
en Key honor societies, Sigma Chi Fraternity, Sigma Xi scientific 
research society and the National Society of Scabbard and Blade, 
the honorary military society for all branches of service. He met 
his wife, Susie, in the eighth grade, and they married during their 
undergraduate years at Auburn. Like Dr. Gogue, Mrs. Gogue also 
earned two Auburn degrees. They are the proud parents of three 
children and have one grandchild. 


Jay Jacobs 


Athletics Director 


Auburn Director of Athletics Jay Jacobs has a 
vision of leading Auburn Athletics to becoming the 
nation’s preeminent Athletics Department. In his 
tenure at the helm of the Tigers’ program, the de- 
partment has prospered athletically, academically 
and financially. 

Under Jacobs’ leadership, Auburn Athletics has 
made major strides benefitting Auburn student-athletes, coaches and 
fans. The department has focused on five strategic goals under his leader- 
ship: Winning, graduating student-athletes, managing the department's 
fiscal affairs, complying with SEC and NCAA rules and providing a posi- 
tive gameday experience. 

The Auburn Athletics Department has consistently ranked in the top 10 
percent of the NACDA Directors Cup and has claimed 10 national cham- 
pionships under Jacobs, including a school-record four titles in 2005-06. 
In 2010, the football program claimed the BCS National Championship, 
its first national title since 1957. The Auburn equestrian team also won 
a pair of national titles in 2011 and 2013. Under Jacobs’ watch, Auburn’s 
athletics programs have captured 22 Southeastern Conference titles. 

Academically, Auburn has earned seven public recognitions by the 
NCAA for scoring in the 90th- 100th percentile nationally in the Academic 
Progress Rate (APR). 

Jacobs served as the Senior Associate Athletics Director for Tigers Un- 
limited prior to his appointment as Director of Athletics and has initiated 
several successful business ventures for the Athletics Department, includ- 
ing a lucrative contract with Under Armour Performance Apparel and a 
nine-year extension with multimedia rights holder IMG. 

During Jacobs’ tenure, Auburn has also moved forward with numer- 
ous facility projects designed to benefit Tiger athletics programs and their 
fans, most notably, the construction of the state-of-the-art Auburn Arena 
and basketball practice facility that opened for the 2010-11 season. The 
most recent facilities upgrade was a $16 million multipurpose 100-yard 
indoor practice facility. 

Jacobs was named Auburn’s 14th Director of Athletics on Dec. 22, 
2004, after working in almost every area of the Auburn Athletics Depart- 
ment for the previous 20 years. 

Jacobs earned his undergraduate and master’s degrees in business 
administration from Auburn in 1985 and 1988, respectively, and was a 
member of the Auburn football team, earning two letters as an offensive 
tackle in 1982 and 1983. He is a member of the Auburn chapter of Phi 
Kappa Phi honorary. 

He is married to the former Angie Sapp of Dublin, Ga. The couple has 
three daughters, Haley, Meagan and Jayne. They are also foster parents.

GAME 2 


Tyler Russell threw for three touchdowns and 222 yards to lead Missis- 
sippi State to 28-10 victory over Auburn in the SEC opener for both teams 
at Scott Field on Saturday. Demetruce McNeal led the Tigers with a career- 
high 18 tackles. 

With the Auburn offense struggling in the first half, Onterio McCalebb 
returned the second half kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown to give the Ti- 
gers a 10-7 lead. It was the second of his career, the other an 83-yarder vs. 
Alabama last year, and Auburn’s first 100-yarder since Tim Carter vs. LSU in 
2000. 

However, it was all Mississippi State after that. 

Mississippi State (2-0, 1-0) answered quickly as the Bulldogs drove 75 
yards in eight plays to regain the lead, 14-10, on Russell’s 13-yard touch- 
down pass to Chad Bumphis touchdown with 11:35 left in the third. 

After holding Auburn (0-2, 0-1) to another three and out, State drove 58 
yards and took a 21-10 lead on Russell’s third touchdown pass, a 3-yard play 
action to a wide-open Marcus Green, who scored his second of the day, in 
the back corner of the end zone with 4:38 to go in the third. 

The Bulldogs iced the game as LaDarius Perkins scampered 21 yards 
breaking four tackles to give State a 28-10 lead with 12:33 left in the game. 

Mississippi State outgained Auburn 388 to 216 as the Tigers didn’t score 
an offensive touchdown. The Tigers had 91 yards rushing, led by freshman 
Mike Blakely’s 42 yards on 11 carries. Kiehl Frazier completed on 13-of-22 
passes for 125 yards to go along with five turnovers, three interceptions and 
two fumbles. Quan Bray had six receptions for 50 yards while Emory Blake 
caught two passes for 31 yards. 

Jonathon Mincy forced a State fumble on Russell’s 8-yard completion 
to Chris Smith, and

GAME 3 


Cody Parkey’s overtime field goal clinched Auburn's first win of the season as 
it defeated Louisiana-Monroe, 31-28, on Saturday afternoon at Jordan-Hare Sta- 
dium. Angelo Blackson made Parkey’s game-winning kick possible as he blocked 
a ULM field goal attempt just minutes earlier during ULM'’s first overtime posses- 
sion. 

Auburn (1-2) saw a 14-point lead disappear late in the fourth quarter as ULM 
(1-1) rallied from a 28-14 deficit to tie the game with 1:18 left in regulation before 
the overtime heroics from Blackson and Parkey. 

Auburn finished the game with a season-high 418 yards of total offense, in- 
cluding 255 on the ground. Onterio McCalebb finished with a 128 yards, his 
fourth career 100-yard rushing game, while Tre Mason had 90 yards rushing on a 
game-high 22 carries. 

Kiehl Frazier was 10-of-18 for 130 yards with a touchdown and an interception 
while his counterpart from ULM, Kolton Browning, was 28-of-46 for 237 yards 
with three touchdowns. 

ULM went 89 yards on its first drive of the game, a 12-play march, and con- 
verted on a fourth-and-goal from the one to take the early touchdown lead, 7-0. 
The drive was capped by a Browning to Harley Scioneaux pass into the corner of 
the end zone, the first of two touchdown catches for the ULM tight end. 

Auburn answered with a five-play, 76-yard scoring drive of its own on its 
first possession. McCalebb had three carries on the drive, including the 27-yard 
touchdown run, while Mason had a 34-yard reception on the previous play to get 
Auburn into ULM territory as Auburn tied it at 7-7. 

Browning put ULM back up a touchdown, 14-7, with his 39-yard touchdown 
run up the middle with 3:52 left in the first half. The run capped a six-play, 80- 
yard drive that ate up just 2:54 of clock time. Auburn immediately answered with 
a quick strike of its own, using a Quan Bray pass back to Frazier for the score. The 
pass covered 33 yards as Auburn went 75 yards in four plays to tie it at 14-14 with 
2:18 left in the half. 

Auburn struck one more time before the half as Frazier’s 33-yard pass to Sam- 
mie Coates as time expired put Auburn ahead, 21-14. Auburn took advantage of 
a 33-yard punt by the Warhawks’ Justin Manton from his own seven yard line to 
set up the score as Auburn had just 22 seconds and no timeouts to work with. 

Auburn came out of halftime with an 11-play, 65-yard drive that put it up 
by two touchdowns, 28-14. Mason rushed seven times on the drive, covering 22 
yards including the one-yard touchdown run.

GAME 4 


Auburn's defense held LSU to a season-low 351 total yards and only three 
points in the final three quarters but fell to the visitors from Baton Rouge, 
12-10, on Saturday night before 86,721 fans at Jordan-Hare Stadium. 

Auburn (1-3, 0-2 SEC) got an outstanding performance from its defense, 
forcing a pair of LSU turnovers, but could not get a crucial stop late in the 
fourth quarter with enough time left to have a final scoring chance as LSU’s 
final drive ate up most of the final four minutes. 

LSU (4-0, 1-0 SEC) had a chance to extend its lead with less than a minute 
to play, but Drew Alleman’s 34-yard field goal attempt sailed wide right. Au- 
burn had one final possession with 37 seconds left, starting from their own 
20, but could only manage 17 yards with no timeouts remaining, and Kiehl 
Frazier’s final desperation heave with no time left was intercepted to end the 
game. 

LSU appeared to be driving for the end zoneon their first possession, but 
Mettenberger fumbled the snap at the Auburn 2-yard-line, where it was re- 
covered by Jeffery Whitaker to end the LSU threat. It was just the second 
fumble lost by LSU so far this season. 

But LSU would find its way onto the scoreboard on Auburn’s next play 
from scrimmage, taking a 2-0 lead on a safety when Tre Mason was tackled 
in the end zone by Sam Montgomery. It was the first safety scored against 
Auburn since the Tigers’ 3-2 victory over Mississippi State in 2008. 

LSU would then take advantage of the good field position after the safety, 
driving 59 yards in nine plays and taking a 9-0 lead on a one-yard touch- 
down run by Michael Ford with 4:18 to play in the first quarter. 

After taking over deep in LSU territory when Corey Lemonier sacked 
Mettenberger and forced a fumble that was recovered by Angelo Blackson, 

Tre Mason went around 

SCORING SUMMARY left end for 26 yards to the 

9 LSU 4-yard-line. On the 

next play, McCalebb walked 

into the end zone for Au- 

burn’s first touchdown of 

the night, cutting the deficit 

to 9-7 as time expired in the 
opening period. 

Following a 42-yard, 
nine-play drive that ate up 
more than five minutes of 
the second quarter, Cody 
Parkey’s 40-yard field goal 
gave Auburn a 10-9 lead 
with 1:21 to play in the half. 

LSU went back on top 
midway through the third 
quarter after an Auburn 
special teams miscue gave 
LSU new life at midfield. A 
30-yard Drew Alleman field 
goal capped a seven-play, 
35-yard scoring drive and 
gave LSU a 12-10 lead - the 
eventual winning margin - 
at the 5:26 mark. 

With the clock wind- 
ing down in the fourth 
quarter and Auburn need- 
ing yet another stop to have 
one final possession, LSU 
converted a key 3rd-and-5 play as Mettenberger connected with Spencer 
Ware for a 33-yard gain into Auburn territory, effectively ending Auburn's 
hopes of a comeback.

GAME 5 


The Arkansas Razorbacks forced five Auburn turnovers and sacked Tiger 
quarterbacks eight times in a 24-7 Razorback win Saturday afternoon before 
85,819 fans at Jordan-Hare Stadium. 

The Razorbacks outgained the Tigers, 372-321, including a 130-40 advantage 
in rushing yards, yet Auburn had 22 first downs to Arkansas’ 19. Auburn also 
matched a season-high with five turnovers and was unable to take advantage of 
Arkansas’ two giveaways. 

Emory Blake paced the Auburn offense with 10 catches for 118 yards and Au- 
burn’s only score. During the game, he hauled in his 100th career reception, be- 
coming the eighth Auburn player to reach that mark, and now has 1,573 receiving 
yards for his career to move into a tie for 10th all-time at Auburn. 

The Tigers used three quarterbacks for the first time this season. Kiehl Frazier 
earned the start and finished 9-of-14 for 118 yards and one interception, but was 
sacked four times in the game. Clint Moseley saw his first game action of the 
season, starting the second half an dfinishing 13-of-21 for 163 yards and a touch- 
down, but he also threw two picks and was sacked four times. Jonathan Wallace 
did not attempt a pass but rushed twice for 11 yards. 

The Razorbacks struck first, taking their second possession of the game 80 
yards in 10 plays, capped by a two-yard touchdown run from Dennis Johnson to 
take a 7-0 lead with just more than a minute left in the first quarter. 

Arkansas took advantage of an Auburn turnover deep in Tiger territory mid- 
way through the second quarter and increased its lead to 10-0 on a 27-yard field 
goal from Zach Hocker with 6:33 to play in the half; the score would remain 10-0 
at the half. 

After neither team could generate much offense throughout the third quarter, 
Auburn mounted a 5-play, 68-yard scoring drive late in the period, cutting the 
deficit to 10-7 on 
a 21-yard touch- 
down pass from 
Moseley to Blake 
with 0:33 left. All

GAME 6 


After Auburn scored 17 straight second quarter points, Ole Miss outscored 
Auburn 27-3 to run away with a 41-20 victory at Vaught- Hemingway Stadium on 
Saturday. Tre Mason rushed for two touchdowns and 82 yards on 18 carries for 
the Tigers while Clint Moseley threw for 118 yards on 11-of-18 passing. 

Ole Miss (4-3, 1-2) opened the game’s scoring on a toss sweep to running back 
Randall Mackey, who threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to quarterback Bo Wallace 
down the left sideline with 7:14 left in the first quarter. 

On Auburn's next possession from its own 28, backup center Tunde Fariyike, 
who was filling in for injured starter Reese Dismukes, snapped the ball over 
Moseley’s head and C.J. Johnson recovered it in the end zone for a touchdown 
and a 14-0 Ole Miss lead less than two minutes later. 

Auburn (1-5. 0-4) bounced right back and drove 74 yards in 13 plays and 6:43 
as it cut the lead in half on a Mason 1- yard touchdown run just over a minute 
into the second quarter. That marked the Tigers’ longest scoring drive of the sea- 
son in plays and time of possession. 

Auburn's defense continued to hold Ole Miss after the Rebels’ opening drive as 
the Tigers took over on the Ole Miss 48. Two plays later, Auburn tied it 14-14. On 
first down, it was a Leroy High to Leroy High connection as Moseley completed 
a 42-yard pass to Sammie Coates to the Ole Miss 6. Mason then ran in up the 
middle on the next play for a touchdown with 5:56 left in the half. 

Cody Parkey then recovered his own onside kick at the Auburn 47 as Auburn 
continued to roll. That led to a career long-tying 46-yard field goal by Parkey as 
the Tigers took a 17-14 lead, their first of the day, with a minute remaining in the 
half. 

However, the Rebels outscored the Tigers 27-3 the rest of the way. 

Ole Miss drove down the field quickly and tied it on the last play of the half on 
a 28-yard field goal by Bryson Rose that ended Auburn's run of 17 consecutive 
points. 

Ole Miss had the 

20 ball to open the sec- 
_ ond half and Wallace 
completed a 45-yard 
pass to Ja-Mes Lo- 
gan in triple cover- 
age to the Auburn 1. 
That set up a Wallace 
touchdown run on 
the next play only 67 
seconds into the sec- 
ond half as Ole Miss 
regained the lead 
24-17 as the Rebels 
scored 10 points in a

Auburn came back 
as Mason's 26-yard 
run to the Ole Miss 
15 to set up Parkey’s 
second field goal of 
the day, a 31-yarder 
that closed Auburn 
within 24-20

Senior Zac Stacy became Vanderbilt’s all-time leading rusher as he gained 169 
yards and a touchdown on 27 carries to lead Vanderbilt to a 17-13 victory over 
Auburn in Vanderbilt Stadium. 

Vanderbilt (3-4, 2-3) took the opening kickoff and drove 75 yards in 16 plays 
to take a 7-0 lead on a 7-yard Wesley Tate touchdown run with 6:35 left. On the 
drive, the Commodores had two successful fourth down conversions. 

Auburn (1-6, 0-5) recovered its second of three fumbles as Vanderbilt failed 
on a fake punt that was recovered by Ashton Richardson at the Commodore 36 
yard line. On 3rd and goal from the 10, Clint Moseley threw behind a wide open 
Emory Blake in the end zone. Cody Parkey brought Auburn to within 7-3 on a 
27-yard field goal with 8:10 left in the half. 

The Tigers stopped the Commodores again on fourth down, this time with an 
inch to go from the Auburn 48 as McKinzy made a huge hit and tackle with just 
under four minutes to go in the half. The key play of Auburn’s scoring drive came 
as Moseley threw a 24-yard strike to Blake on play action to the Vandy 6. Onterio 
McCalebb rushed it to the 1, and Tre Mason punched it in despite a shaky handoff 
to give Auburn its first lead of the game at 10-7 with 1:21 before halftime. 

Vanderbilt quickly drove 65 yards in 11 plays as Carey Spear kicked a 30-yard 
field goal to tie the game 10-10 on the last play of the half. 

The Commodores stopped the Tigers on the opening possession of the third 
quarter and scored on its second consecutive drive to take a 17-10 lead on Stacy’s 
2-yard run with 7:34 on the clock. Vanderbilt drove 85 yards in 7 plays in only 
2:56. 

Auburn had the beginnings of another good drive as Mason had a career-long 
34-yard rush on a nice block by Patrick Miller to the Vanderbilt 40, but a pair of 
false start penalties and a 10-yard third down sack pushed Auburn back to its 
own 40. The Tigers punted the ball to the Commodores with less than a minute 
to go in the third. 

Auburn took over on 
its own 49 with 14:01 left in 
the game. Parkey nailed his 
second field goal of the day, a 
39-yarder, to make it a 17-13 
Vanderbilt lead with 9:55 re- 
maining. 

Vanderbilt responded 
as Jordan Rodgers completed 
a 37-yard pass to a wide open 
Chris Boyd to the Auburn 38.

Auburn had it 2nd and 
2 from its own 45, but Mason 
had a rush for no gain and 
McCalebb lost two yards. 

The Commodores took 
over on their own 19 with 
4:41 remaining. On the first 
play, Stacy, a native of Cent- 
reville, Ala., and Bibb County

True freshman quarterback Jonathan Wallace connected on touchdown 
passes to C.J. Uzomah and Emory Blake and threw for 122 yards but it wasn’t 
enough to overcome No. 21/22 Texas A&M's 672 yards of total offense as the 
Auburn football team fell to 1-7, 0-6 SEC with a 63-21 loss. 

Both of Wallace’s touchdown tosses covered 27 yards and both came in 
the third quarter after Auburn went down 49-7 at the half. Auburn’s lone 
score in the first half was a Tre Mason one-yard run on Auburn’ first posses- 
sion of the second quarter, Mason's fifth scoring run in the last four contests. 

Wallace finished the night 6-for-9 from the pocket and also ran for 71 
yards on 13 attempts while Mason rushed 12 times for 80 yards and his fifth 
touchdown of the season. 

Texas A&M (6-2, 3-2 SEC) quarterback Johnny Manziel threw for 260 
yards on 16-for-23 passing with two touchdowns and also ran for 90 yards 
and three touchdowns on nine carries. 

Emory Blake finished the night with five catches for 106 yards and moved 
into fifth in the Auburn record books with his 16th receiving touchdown 
catch. Uzomah, making his first start at tight end, had three catches for 90 

ards. 
° Leading tacklers for Auburn were safety Demetruce McNeal (10 tackles),

Tre Mason and Onterio McCalebb combined for 265 rushing yards and three 
touchdowns, and Auburn snapped a five-game losing skid with a 42-7 Home- 
coming victory over New Mexico State at Jordan-Hare Stadium Saturday after- 
noon. 

Mason carried 22 times for a career-high 152 yards and a touchdown, averag- 
ing 6.9 yards per carry. Meanwhile, McCalebb made the most of his eight touches, 
picking up 113 yards (14.1/carry) while scoring two touchdowns. 

Freshman Jonathan Wallace made his first start at quarterback, completing 
9-of-16 attempts for 164 yards and a touchdown along with one interception. 

Auburn outgained New Mexico State 475-305, including a 311-83 advantage 
on the ground. The Tigers also converted on 5-of-12 third-down opportunities 
and held NMSU to a 2-for-13 conversion rate. Auburn turned the ball over just 
once while the Aggies had two giveaways. 

McCalebb got his first score when he broke loose on a 38-yard run around the 
right end for Auburn's fourth score of the day, its third via rushing touchdown, 
to make it 28-0 Tigers at the 2:58 mark of the third quarter. His run finished off a 
96-yard scoring drive - Auburn’s longest of the season by yardage - that lasted just 
seven plays and 3:26. 

The Auburn senior would add his second touchdown of the day on a 7-yard 
run with 11:20 to play in the game, giving the Tigers a 35-7 lead. McCalebb’s 
scoring run was set up by his own 45-yard kickoff return to near midfield, and a 
40-yard run by Mason got Auburn in the red zone two plays later. 

Trovon Reed capped off the scoring for Auburn with a 40-yard reception from 
Wallace for his first career touchdown, giving the Tigers a 42-7 lead with 7:19 
to play. 

After a scoreless first quarter, the Tigers struck first with a five-yard touch- 
down run from Mason that capped a 13-play, 89-yard drive to give Auburn a 7-0 
lead with 4:56 to play in the half. It marked the longest scoring drive of the season 
for the Tigers. That would be the halftime score as NMSU would be unable to 


GAME 10 


Emory Blake had his eighth career 100-yard receiving game, but Georgia 
earned a 38-0 win over Auburn on Saturday night before 86,146 fans at Jordan- 
Hare Stadium. 

The Tigers fell to 2-8 overall, 0-7 in SEC play. With the win, Georgia (9-1, 7-1 
SEC) clinched the SEC Eastern Division title and a spot in next month’s SEC 
Championship Game. 

Blake had a team-best 108 receiving yards on six catches, his fourth time over 
100 yards this season. Auburn quarterback Jonathan Wallace, making his second 
career start, finished with 15 completions on 22 attempts for 181 yards and an 
interception. His 15 completions were the most by an Auburn quarterback in a 
game this season. 

The Tigers struggled in the rushing game, gaining just 57 yards on 27 at- 
tempts. Tre Mason led the way with 33 yards, and Onterio McCalebb had 16 on 
the ground to go along with 43 receiving yards on three catches. 

Georgias Aaron Murray completed 18-of-24 pass attempts on the night for 
208 yards and three touchdowns, connecting with six different receivers as the 
Bulldogs employed a balanced attack throughout the game. Running backs Todd 
Gurley and Keith Marshall each topped the 100-yard mark with Gurley getting 11 
carries for 116 yards and Marshall rushing eight times for 105. Malcolm Mitchell 
was Georgia's leading receiver with 47 yards on five catches. 

Georgia outgained the Tigers 497-238 with 24 first downs to Auburn's 11. The 
Bulldogs also converted 8-of-14 third downs. 

The Bulldogs marched straight down the field on their first possession, taking 
a 7-0 lead on a six-yard completion from Murray to Chris Conley with 10:51 to 
play in the first quarter. The scoring opportunity was set up by a 49-yard rush 
down the left sideline by Gurley on his first carry of the game. 

Georgia doubled its lead to 14-0 late in the opening quarter, driving 80 yards 
in nine plays and scoring on Murray’s second touchdown pass of the night, this

sion of the second quarter as Auburn scored on each of its first four possessions 
en route to its largest margin of victory of the season. The score, his second of the 
season, capped a 91-yard drive, which was Auburn's second longest of the season. 

After Coates touchdown catch made it 35-0 at the half, Alabama A&M scored

the season after he won the Outland Trophy: 


ROGER DUANE (Zeke) SMITH—22—6-2—215—Sr.— Uniontown, Ala. ... Won Outland Award in 1958 as nation’s most outstanding lineman 
... Greatest guard in history of Auburn ... All-SEC and All-America in 1958 by unanimous choice ... Considered best line-backing guard 
in Dixie ... Selected to first-string All-America on following teams: Look Magazine, Associated Press, NEA, FWAA, Football Digest, Time 
Magazine, Sports Illustrated, Chicago Tribune, Coach and Athlete ... All-SEC on Associated Press and United Press International and SEC 
Lineman of the Year choice of Atlanta Touchdown Club and Birmingham Quarterback Club ... Lineman of the Week by the Associated 
Press for his play against Tennessee in 1958 season opener ... Led a Tiger defense which allowed the Vols no first downs and minus-33 yards 
total offense for the afternoon ... Third-string frosh center who was held out as a sophomore ... Came to Auburn as a slow-footed runner 
but worked hard to obtain powerful muscles and agility ... Has tremendous quickness, speed and power ... Plays left guard on offense but 
becomes middle linebacker on a five-man line, which Auburn uses 70 percent of the time ... Voted “Best Offensive Guard in SEC” by confer- 
ence coaches in 1958 ... Speed and quickness make him a natural on pulling and blocking ends (Auburn guards pull on about 80 percent of 
all plays) ... Drafted by Baltimore Colts following 1958 season as fourth draft pick despite having another year of eligibility ... Turned down 
$15,000 to sign with Canadian League team because, as he said: “Auburn took me when no one else wanted me. I’m where I am today because 
of Coach Ralph Jordan and Auburn, and I believe I owe Auburn more than I could ever give” ... Education major. 


OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF ZEKE SMITH—Handsome blond with blue eyes ... Born on Sept. 29, 1936, at Walker Springs, Ala. ...Moved 
to Uniontown (Pop. 2,000) when he was six years old ... Unheralded as a high school fullback, he was not approached by another college ... 
Nicknamed “Zeke” by high school coach who said he ran like Zeke Bratkowski (Georgia’s famed “Brat” averaged losing 200 yards rushing 
each year) ... First-string Scholastic All-America by the Peoples Encyclopedia Company ... Called, along with Lou Michaels of Kentucky, 
“The Greatest Lineman in the SEC in the past 10 years,” by Georgia Tech’s Bobby Dodd ... Will be always remembered by football writ- 
ers who attended the Look Magazine party in New York for accepting the OUTLAND AWARD by saying, “Thank you gentlemen for this 
HEISMAN TROPHY ... I mean OUTLAND AWARD.” Smith did this twice within 30 seconds ... Spent this past summer as assistant 
sergeant-at-arms in Alabama Senate ... Pre-season All-SEC and All-America ... Married this summer.

Auburn’s best defensive performance 
ever against Georgia Tech in 1987, 
intercepting three passes, returning one 
45 yards for a touchdown, causing a 
fumble that was recovered in the end 
zone for another Auburn touchdown, 
recording three quarterback sacks, 
recovering one fumble and accounting

satile offensive linemen in Auburn 
history. When the Tigers were setting 
records with Heisman Trophy winner 
Bo Jackson and All-American Brent 
Fullwood, Searels was one of Auburn’s 
best run blockers. When Auburn went 
to a more pass oriented offense in 1987, 
Searels was one of Auburn’s best pass 
blockers as well. A three-year starter 
at tackle, he was All-SEC in 1986 and 
1987 and an AP and Football News All- 
American in 1987. Searels was a fourth

Cliff Hare Award 


The highest honor an Auburn athlete can receive 
is the Cliff Hare Award which is presented annu- 
ally to the athlete who, “in addition to athletic and 
scholastic achievement, exhibits in great degree the 
qualities of leadership, integrity and courage.” 

The award is given in memory of Clifford Leroy 
Hare, a member of Auburn’s first football team, 
professor of chemistry, president of the Southern 
Conference, and faculty athletic chairman. Dean 
Hare believed, “athletics make men strong, study 
makes men wise, and character makes men great.”

Auburn Awards 


Unsung Hero Award 


The Unsung Hero Award is presented annually by the Chilton County 
Auburn Club to an individual whose good work and meaningful contri- 
bution has gone largely unnoticed by the public. Established in 1966, the 
Unsung Hero Award was presented to Auburn athletes until 1988 when 
NCAA rule changes no longer allowed alumni groups to present awards 
to student-athletes. From 1988-96, the award was been presented to a 
deserving staff member. In 1997, Auburn student-athletes were once again 
eligible to win the award.

Bill Streit Award 


The Bill Streit Award is presented annually, by the Jefferson County 
Auburn Club, to the senior football player with the highest grade point 
average. It is presented in memory of G.W. “Bill” Streit, a tackle on 
Auburn’s 1904 and 1905 teams and a member of Auburn’s All-Time 
Team selected in 1943. Streit, an outstanding scholar-athlete, earned a 
degree from Auburn and went on to become a success in the business and 
professional world. He continued to support the game he loved, college 
football, by officiating in the Southern and Southeastern Conferences for 
many years. Bill Streit credited any success he achieved to his Auburn 
experiences, both athletically and academically. It is in that spirit that the 
Bill Streit Award is presented.

Auburn Awards 


Four major awards are presented to Auburn football players each year. These awards are for outstanding accomplishment on the field and they are named for 
four of Auburn’s greatest football players. The Leading Tackler Award is named in honor of Mike Kolen, Auburn’s Captain Crunch. After an outstanding career at 
Auburn, Kolen went on to play on two Miami world championship teams, including the undefeated team of 1972. The Defensive Player of the Year Award is named 
in honor of Zeke Smith, a two-time All-America in 1958-59 and winner of the Outland Award in 1958. The Best Blocking Lineman Award is named for Ken Rice, 
an All-America tackle in 1959-60, one of Auburn’s last great two-way players. The Offensive Player of the Year Award is named for Pat Sullivan, quarterback from 


1969-71, and winner of the 1971 Heisman Trophy.

All-Time Teams 


There have been two “all-time” teams selected in Auburn’s 100-year football history, the “All-Time Team” selected by readers of 
The Birmingham News and Birmingham Age-Herald in 1943, and the “Team of the Century” selected by vote of the fans in 1992, the 
centennial year of Auburn Football. 

Since it is impossible for players of earlier generations to receive fair consideration in popular voting by fans of another generation, 
and since the game of football has changed from a game where one player played both offense and defense to a game where players 
specialize in offense or defense, both teams are considered official and both are regarded as “Auburn’s All-Time Teams.”

Marcus Nash’s 73-yard catch and run 
in the fourth quarter provided the winning 
points as Tennessee defeated Auburn, 30-29, 
in the 1997 SEC Championship Game. Peyton 
Manning’s scoring pass to Nash capped a 
13-point Vol comeback. 

Tennessee jumped out to an early lead 
when Manning hit Peerless Price on a 40-yard 
score on the first drive of the game. But 
Auburn took advantage of Vol miscues to 
score on a pair of Jaret Holmes field goals, 
a 24-yard Brad Ware fumble recovery and a 
51-yard Dameyune Craig-to-Tyrone Goodson 
pass. The Tigers led 20-10 heading into the 
intermission. 


The two teams exchanged touchdowns early in the third quarter before 
Manning hit Price for another score, this one from 46 yards out, late in the 
third. However, Auburn’s Charles Dorsey blocked the PAT, which was 
returned by Quinton Reese for a 29-23 Tiger lead. 

Auburn enjoyed that lead until Nash caught a five-yard pass from

Georgia Dome (73,427) * Atlanta, Ga. 


Turnovers plagued the 17th- 
ranked Tigers in their rematch against 
the 7th-ranked Florida Gators in the 2000 
SEC Championship Game in Atlanta. 

Florida scored touchdowns off 
three Auburn turnovers in the first half 
to come away with a 28-6 victory. 

On the first play of the game, 
Auburn quarterback Ben Leard hit 
Reggie Worthy for a 10-yard gain, but the 
ball was knocked loose and the Gators 
recovered at the Auburn 41-yard line. 

Five plays later, Florida quarter- 
back Rex Grossman connected with Reche Caldwell on a 10-yard scoring pass 
to give the Gators a 7-0 lead less than two minutes into the game. 

After an exchange of punts, Auburn took over at its 31-yard line and went 
on its first march into Florida territory. Leard hooked up with Ronney Daniels 
twice for 17 yards and hit Rudi Johnson for an 11 yard gain to move the Tigers 
to the Florida 22-yard line. 

But the drive ended when Leard’s pass for Daniels was intercepted at the 
seven-yard line. 

The Gators wasted little time in converting on the turnover. Grossman again 
found Caldwell, this time for 
a 66-yard scoring strike to 
give Florida a 14-0 advan- 
tage. 

Auburn again marched

Auburn Bowl History 


1937 Bacardi Bowl 


Auburn 7 


Villanova 7 
January 1, 1937 
Cuban National Sports Festival 


Havana, Cuba 


Auburn’s bowl history began in 1937 when the Tigers and 
Villanova tied 7-7 in the Bacardi Bowl, sometimes referred to as the 
Rhumba Bowl or the Cigar Bowl, the climaxing event of Cuba’s annual 
National Sports Festival. The game was played in Havana, Cuba, and 
is the first and only bowl game to ever be played outside the United 
States. 

An Auburn drive in the first quarter stalled on the 10-yard line 
where the Wildcats took over on downs. After a Villanova punt, 
Auburn back Billy Hitchcock broke loose around left end and rambled 
40 yards for the Tigers only score. The score at the half was Auburn 
7, Villanova 0. 

Auburn stopped a Villanova drive on its own 12-yard line during 
the third quarter but couldn't get field position. Villanova was able 
to tie the score when they blocked an Auburn quick kick and the ball 
bounced into the endzone where Wildcat Lineman Matthews Kuber 
fell on it for the score. The PAT tied up the game. 

Auburn’s return to the States marked an end to more than 11,000 
miles of football travel for the 7-2-2 Tigers that finished the season 
ranked 13th in the nation under coach Jack Meagher. 

The game was played in a revolutionary atmosphere. Fulgencio 
Batista, the dictator who would be overthrown by Fidel Castro 22 years 
later, had just assumed power. The game was almost canceled because 
Batista’s picture was not in the game program. A quick trip to the 
_ 7. printer saved the Bacardi Bowl 
— 7. and allowed Auburn’s bow! his- 
tory to get off to a significant and 
historical beginning.

January 1, 1938 
Orange Bowl 
Miami, Florida 


Southeastern Conference officials lifted a ban which forbade SEC 
teams to play postseason games in bowls other than the Rose and Sugar 
Bowls and allowed Auburn to play Michigan State in the Orange Bowl. 

A capacity crowd of 19,000 fans watched an aggressive Auburn 
team defeat the powerful Spartans, 6-0 limiting Michigan State to only 
two first downs, the first coming late in the third quarter, and 57 total 
offensive yards, 32 yards rushing and 25 passing. Auburn racked up 233 
yards on the ground and 79 through the air for 312 total yards. 

Auburn’s only score was set up by a George Kenmore 60-yard punt 
return that put the Tigers on the Spartan 36-yard line. On the first play 
from scrimmage Kenmore passed to Ralph O’Gwynne at the Spartan 
two-yard line. On fourth and goal from the one, O’Gwynne circled left 
end for the only score of the game.

In Auburn’s first bowl appearance in 15 years, and first bowl game 
under Ralph “Shug” Jordan, the Tigers’ starting offensive backfield 
included a future Governor of Alabama (Fob James) and a future coach 
of the University of Georgia (Vince Dooley), but Texas Tech was not 
impressed and handed the Tigers a 35-13 defeat. 

Dooley guided Auburn to a touchdown the first time they had the 
ball as the Tigers went 60 yards in 10 plays, with James’ 21-yard run 
being a key play in the drive. Bobby Duke scored from the one. A tough 
Auburn defense held the Red Raiders, the nation’s highest scoring 
team, to just 11 yards in the first quarter. But it wasn’t long before they 
would get on track. 

Texas Tech scored early in the second period on a 30-yard pass 
from Jack Kirkpatrick to Bobby Cavazos. Auburn came back after 
an intercepted pass, and Dooley 
scored on a 10-yard run to end 
the drive. The Tigers led 13-7 at 
halftime, but it was all downhill 
from there. 

Texas Tech scored the first 
two times they had the ball in 
the second half, once after block- 
ing an Auburn punt, to lead at

Auburn became the first team to play in the same bowl game twice 
in the same year when they defeated Baylor 33-13 in the 1954 Gator 
Bowl. The Tigers had met Texas Tech in the Jan. 1, 1954, Gator Bowl, 
but then Gator Bowl officials decided to move the game away from 
New Year’s Day. 

Baylor fumbled the opening kickoff, Auburn recovered and five 
plays later “Joltin Joe” Childress scored the first Auburn touchdown. 

Baylor came back with a nine-play, 63-yard drive to tie the score at 
7-7 at the end of the first quarter. 

Auburn’s two possessions of the second quarter resulted in a pair 
of touchdowns, a 43-yard run by Fob James and a four-yard Bobby 
Freeman to Jimmy Long pass which capped a 92-yard drive. Auburn 
led at the half, 21-7. 

The Tigers scored twice in the second half, sandwiching their scores 
around a five-play, 66-yard drive by the Bears. Childress capped an

It was Auburn’s third straight trip to the Gator Bowl and Vanderbilt’s 
first bowl game ever, and that might tell the story of Auburn’s 25-13 
upset loss to the Commodores. 

Vanderbilt scored first on a seven-yard Don Orr to Joe Stephenson 
pass which was set up by a Howell Tubbs fumble, the first of three 
for him that day, which gave the Commodores the ball on the Tigers’ 
39-yard line. Auburn scored early in the second quarter, driving 72 
yards for the TD. Tubbs passed to Fob James for 38 yards and the 
touchdown. Vanderbilt scored quickly, going 76 yards in four plays as 
Orr scored from the three-yard line. The extra point was not good and 
the Commodores led at the half, 13-7. 

Another Tubbs fumble set up Vanderbilt’s first scoring drive of the 
second half. Recovering at the Auburn 45-yard line, Vanderbilt took 
eight plays to score with Phil King going over from the one, giving 
Vanderbilt a 19-7 lead. A poor punt and a 15-yard penalty gave the 
Commodores the ball on the Auburn 26-yard line after the Tigers were 
unable to move. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Charlie Horton 
scored from the Auburn one to give Vanderbilt a 25-7 lead. Auburn 
finished the scoring with a seven-yard Jimmy Cook to Red Phillips pass 
at the end of a six-play, 66-yard drive to make the final score 25-13. 

Auburn fumbled five times with Vanderbilt recovering all five to set 
up the Tigers most disappointing loss of the 1955 campaign. The Tigers 

finished with an 8-2-1 record.

A trip to the Orange Bowl capped a near perfect season for the 
Auburn Tigers. Coach “Shug” Jordan led his Tigers to a 9-1 record 
with a rugged defense and an option offense featuring All-America 
quarterback Jimmy Sidle and halfback Tucker Frederickson. Auburn 
had defeated Alabama 10-8 to earn the chance to play the Big Eight 
powerhouse Nebraska Cornhuskers. 

Auburn found itself in the hole on the second play from scrimmage 
as Nebraska quarterback Dennis Claridge sneaked off right guard 
for a 68-yard touchdown gallop that left Auburn trailing 7-0 before 
most of the fans were seated. Two Dave Theissen field goals gave the 
Cornhuskers a 13-0 lead with over 10 minutes remaining in the first 
half. That is the lead the Nebraska team took in the locker room. 

The “Jekyll and Hyde” Auburn team was as dominating in the sec- 
ond half as they were inept in the first half. Sidle led the resurgence of 
the Tigers by capping off their only scoring drive with a 13-yard run in 
the third quarter. With only 1:30 left in the game, the Tigers were on 
the Nebraska 10-yard line. But a costly motion penalty and an incom- 
plete fourth down desperation pass sealed the Cornhusker victory. 

Auburn dominated in the second half, combining for 110 rushing 
yards and 101 passing yards while limiting Nebraska to 43 yards on the 
ground and nine in the air. 

Sidle finished the day with 96 
yards rushing on 21 carries.

Liberty Bow! Memorial Stadium 


Memphis, Tennessee 


It was the seventh annual Liberty Bowl, but the first to be played in 
the present site of Memphis, Tenn., that saw the Ole Miss Rebels hold 
off a gallant Auburn comeback to win 13-7. 

Ole Miss got the scoring started when Johnny Keyes connected on 
a 42-yard field goal in the first period. Auburn marched right back 
and scored when fullback Tom Bryan broke off left tackle and raced 
44 yards for the touchdown. The score at halftime was Auburn 7, Ole 
Miss 3. 

The Rebels took the opening kickoff and ran off nine consecutive 
rushing plays to march to the Tiger six-yard line. From there reserve 
quarterback Joe Graves went to the air and found wingback Doug 
Cunningham for a six-yard touchdown pass. The extra point gave Ole 
Miss a 10-7 lead. Keyes added another field goal to complete the scor- 
ing but not the action. Auburn marched deep into Rebel territory. But, 
with only seconds remaining, the Tigers’ desperation fourth down pass 
fell incomplete, preserving the win for the Rebels. 

Auburn’s Bryan was selected as the game’s Most Valuable Player 
and the Outstanding Back. He 
finished with 111 rushing yards 
on 19 carries. Tiger back Robert 
Fulghum was selected as the 
Outstanding Defensive Back. 
Coach “Shug” Jordan’s team fin- 
ished with a 5-5-1 record.

Arizona 10 
December 28, 1968 
Sun Bowl Stadium 
El Paso, Texas 


The Tigers broke open a 10-10 halftime deadlock and exploded to a 
Sun Bowl win in El Paso, Texas. 

Auburn jumped to a 10-0 lead early in the game behind a 65-yard 
scoring pass from quarterback Loran Carter to halfback Mickey Zofko 
and a 52-yard field goal by John Riley. Arizona came back with a touch- 
down pass and field goal of its own to tie the score as the players headed 
for the locker room at the half. 

Auburn reserve quarterback, Tommy Traylor, scampered nine 
yards to open the second half scoring for the Tigers on their first pos- 
session of the half. Two plays later, Buddy McClinton picked off an 
errant Wildcat pass, one of three interceptions for McClinton, and 
raced 32 yards for another Auburn score. Riley added another field 
goal and Carter flipped a 43-yard touchdown pass to Tim Christian to 
complete the Tiger scoring. 

The game’s oddest play 
occurred when Auburn punt- 
er Connie Frederick had a 
punt blocked by Arizona. The 
Wildcats almost recovered the 
loose ball for a touchdown but

Auburn played its first football game indoors, losing to Houston 
36-7 in the Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl. 

Houston executed its veer offense to perfection and executed 
Auburn in the process. Behind the leadership of sophomore quarter- 
back Gary Mullins, the Cougars piled up Astro-Bluebonnet records for 
rushing yards with 376 and total yards with 516. 

Auburn’s Terry Beasley, just a sophomore, fumbled the ball away 
at the Tiger 29-yard line on the opening kickoff. The Cougars covered 
those 29 yards in seven plays with Mullins sneaking over from the 
one-yard line. 

Later, Houston capped an 80-yard drive with a Carlos Lopez 
27-yard field goal to take a 10-0 lead early in the second quarter. A bowl 
record 57-yard punt by Auburn’s Connie Frederick put Houston back 
at its own 16-yard line, but the Cougars stormed away with an 84-yard, 
five-play drive. Strong went 74 yards on the first play of the drive and 
scored the touchdown on fourth and goal from the one. 

Auburn mounted its only scoring drive of the game, going 67 yards 
in five short plays in the second quarter. A 36-yard halfback pass from 
Mickey Zofko to Frederick finished the drive. The Tigers seemed to 
take the momentum into the locker room after blocking a Cougar 
25-yard field goal attempt, late in the quarter. 

But Houston took command early in the second half. After receiv- 
ing the second half kickoff, the 
Cougars marched 73 yards in 
eight rushing plays and scored 
when Ted Heiskell cracked over 
from the one yard line. The two- 
point conversion attempt failed 
and Houston led 22-7. Auburn 
drove to the Houston 28-yard 
uH_ line before a Rat Riley 45-yard

This game was billed as the “Battle of the Quarterbacks,” and it was 
that and more. Auburn had Pat Sullivan, heir apparent to the Heisman 
Trophy the next year, and Ole Miss had Archie Manning, one of the 
top QBs in SEC history. 

Auburn started off quickly as it was the familiar combination of 
Sullivan to Terry Beasley for a 13-yard scoring strike with just over 
three minutes gone in the game. Auburn scored twice more before 
Ole Miss could retaliate. Sullivan connected with Alvin Bresler for an 
eight-yard touchdown pass. On the first play from scrimmage after the 
kickoff, Auburn recovered a Rebel fumble and went up 21 points as 
Sullivan executed the quarterback draw for 37 yards and a touchdown. 

Manning led a Rebel comeback by directing his team to a 79-yard, 
10-play drive capping it off with a one-yard run. Manning later 
connected with Floyd Franks on a 34-yard touchdown pass to cut 
Auburn’s lead to 21-14 at the half. 

A 42-yard, Sullivan-to-Beasley pass set up Auburn’s first score 
in the second half, as Mickey Zofko hit off right tackle for a six yard 
touchdown run early in the third quarter. Manning led his team back 
again with a 42-yard run to put 
the Rebels at the Auburn 23-yard 
line.

Auburn’s final score came on 
a Larry Willingham 55-yard punt 
return with only nine seconds 
remaining in the third quarter, 
to take the Tigers to a 35-21 
advantage. 

Manning was again the key 
to the Rebels’ final score as he 
scrambled for a 37-yard gain 
to the Auburn 34. From there 
Chumbler went over from the

The game was not as close as the score indicated and the score was 
bad enough. Auburn’s long-dreamed-of, much-hoped-for trip to the 
Sugar Bowl turned into a nightmare as the Oklahoma Sooners, capital- 
izing on three first half turnovers, executed their wishbone offense to 
perfection in building up a 31-0 halftime lead before cruising back to 
Norman with a 40-22 win. 

The Sooners took the opening kickoff 77 yards in 13 plays and ran 
off over six minutes on the clock as they scored their first touchdown 
of the day on a Leon Crosswhite four-yard run, giving Oklahoma a 
quick 6-0 lead. The option was working to perfection five minutes later 
as quarterback Jack Mildren kept the ball for a five-yard touchdown 
run. A 71-yard punt return for a touchdown by Joe Wylie following 
Auburn’s next possession opened the flood gates. Mildren scored twice 
more before the half on runs of four and seven yards to complete the 
first-half whitewash and head into the locker room with a 31-0 lead. 

After a 53-yard field goal by the Sooners, Auburn finally got on 
the scoreboard when Harry Unger dove over right guard from the one 
yard line. Oklahoma again scored on the option, this time Greg Pruitt 
sweeping around the left side from two yards out to make the score 
40-7. 

Two Oklahoma fumbles set up the Tigers’ last two scores as Sullivan 
connected with Sandy Cannon 
for an 11 yard touchdown pass 
and Unger again dove over from 
the one yard line. Final score, 
Oklahoma 40 - Auburn 22.

Gator Bowl 
Jacksonville, Florida 


No one gave Auburn much of a chance in the 28th annual Gator 
Bowl Classic. The Colorado Buffaloes were bigger, stronger and said 
to be quicker and meaner. Auburn lost its starting quarterback Randy 
Walls, to a knee injury at the start of bowl practice and had to bring 
on virtually unknown and untested Wade Whatley to lead the offense. 
Those experts who didn’t think Auburn had a chance just didn’t know 
these Tigers. 

The Tigers were predicted to finish with a 2-9 record against the 
nation’s toughest schedule. Instead they finished with a 10-1 record 
and earned the nickname “The Amazin’s” because they never seemed 
to know the odds and they never admitted defeat. The Tigers defeated 
No. 2 ranked and unbeaten Alabama 17-16 after blocking two con- 
secutive punts for touchdowns in the final minutes of the game. Coach 
“Shug” Jordan called “The Amazin’s” his favorite team. 

Gardner Jett opened the Tiger scoring in the Gator Bowl with a 
27-yard field goal early in the second quarter of action. A Colorado 
fumble on the ensuing possession gave the ball to the Tigers on the 
Buffalo 16-yard line. Five plays later, Whatley slid over from the one 
for Auburn’s first touchdown. 

Auburn’s second touchdown of the game came with just over six 
minutes to play in third quarter when the Tigers executed the halfback 
pass to perfection. Mike Fuller received the pitch from Whatley and 
connected with Rob Spivey for a 22-yard score capping a six-play, 
56-yard drive. Colorado scored its only points of the game on a 33-yard 
Fred Lima field goal with 7:30 
left to play in the game which 
ended an 80-yard 14-play drive. 

The Tigers retaliated with 
a fake field goal that resulted 
in Auburn’s final score. Holder 
Dave Beck took the snap,

Missouri’s defense kept Auburn’s offense off balance from the 
opening kickoff and stormed away with a 34-17 win in the 39th annual 


Sun Bowl. 


Auburn was able to score first following a Missouri fumble which 
Auburn’s Rusty Deen recovered at the Missouri 49. Auburn’s seven- 
play drive could only muster 30 yards and the Tigers settled for a 


35-yard Roger Pruett field goal. 


After an exchange of punts, Missouri recovered an Auburn fumble 
at the AU 35-yard line. One play later, Missouri had the lead as quar- 
terback Chuck Link passed to John Kelsey for the TD. 

Missouri scored again one minute later following another Auburn 
fumble. Ray Bybee scored on a two-yard run capping a three-play, 


24-yard drive. 


Missouri continued to move the ball, scoring on a 10-play, 48-yard 
drive, with Ray Smith connecting with Kelsey from two yards for his 
second touchdown, and a 21-3 Missouri lead.

With 3:08 to play in the first 
half, Auburn started on its only 
real offensive threat of the game. 
Quarterback Phil Gargis passed 
to Thomas Gossom from 17 yards 
out. Only eight seconds remained 
in the half and Auburn had cut 
the lead to 21-10. 

On the ensuing kickoff, 
Missouri’s John Moseley took the 
ball 84 yards for the touchdown. 
Missouri went to the locker room 
with a comfortable 28-10. 

Missouri opened the sec- 
ond half scoring on a five-play, 
33-yard drive that began after 
recovering an Auburn fumble. 
Smith found Jim Sharp in the cor- 
ner of the endzone on a 14-yard 
scoring strike to make Missouri’s 
lead 34-10. 


The Auburn Tigers made their sixth Gator Bowl appearance, and 
their third in five years, a success when they defeated the Darrell Royal- 
coached Texas Longhorns 27-3. Had not Auburn fumbled seven times, 
a bowl record, the score might have been even more embarrassing as 
the Tigers dominated from the opening kickoff. 

The Tigers stopped the Longhorns on the Texas four-yard line fol- 
lowing the opening kickoff and Texas never seemed to recover. Auburn 
got its first chance with the ball at its 40-yard line and promptly drove 
60 yards for its first touchdown. The drive was capped when quarter- 
back Phil Gargis connected with Ed Butler for a seven-yard score. 

A Longhorn fumble gave the Tigers the ball at the Texas 27. Two 
Mitzi Jackson runs covered the distance to the endzone as Auburn went 
up 14-0 with only nine minutes gone in the game. 

Texas started a drive on their own 23-yard line. The Longhorns 
moved the ball to the Auburn 18-yard line, behind the running of 
freshman running back Earl Campbell before the drive sputtered. The 
Longhorns settled for a Billy Scott 35-yard field goal with 1:00 left to 
play in the first quarter and Auburn led 14-3. 

When Texas tried to punt the ball away from inside their own 
10-yard line, Auburn’s Jim 
McKinney blocked the punt out 
of the endzone for a safety. 

Auburn scored its final points 
in the fourth quarter. Gargis 
passed to Butler for 14 yards and 
a touchdown for one score. The

The Auburn Tigers, 8-3 on the year and yearning for national 
recognition, defeated Boston College 33-26 before a sellout crowd of 
51,296 in the Tangerine Bowl. The Tigers faced one of the nation’s 
best passers in BC quarterback Doug Flutie, but in the end it was 
Auburn, not Boston College, who lived by the pass. Auburn QB Randy 
Campbell was named the game’s Most Valuable Player, narrowly 
edging teammates Lionel James who gained 101 yards on 18 carries, 
and Mark Dorminey, who intercepted one of Flutie’s passes and was 
the game’s Most Valuable Defensive player. The Tigers traveled by 
land as well as air. Ten Auburn backs carried the football, with James’

Al Del Greco’s 19-yard field goal with 23 seconds remaining in the 
game gave Auburn a hard fought 9-7 win over Michigan and its first 
Sugar Bowl Championship. 

It was Del Greco’s third field goal of the night as the senior account- 
ed for all of Auburn’s scoring. In addition to the game winner, Del 
Greco had kicks of 31 and 32 yards. 

Auburn’s Bo Jackson was the game’s leading rusher, gaining 130 
yards on 22 carries. Jackson, closing out a brilliant sophomore season 
which saw him become a consensus All-American, was named winner 
of the Miller-Digby Trophy as the game’s outstanding player. 

Auburn’s winning drive covered 60 yards in 16 plays. The Tigers 
took possession on their own 39 with 7:44 left in the game. The ball was 
on the Michigan one when Auburn elected to kick the field goal rather 
than go for a touchdown on fourth and one. 

Coach Pat Dye’s Tigers finished with an 11-1 record, the SEC 

Championship, and a third place

December 27, 1984 
Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium 
Memphis, Tennessee 


Halfback Bo Jackson closed out his injury-shortened junior season 
with a Liberty Bowl MVP performance against the Razorbacks of 
Arkansas. Jackson gained 88 yards on 18 carries and scored two touch- 
downs, with his final score the difference in the game. 

Arkansas scored first with 7:27 in the first quarter on a 31-yard 
field goal by Greg Horne. But with 3:00 left in the first period, Jackson 
capped off an 80-yard drive as he scored on a 2-yard run. Robert 
McGinty’s PAT attempt was no good. 

Auburn scored again before the first quarter was over when fresh- 
man cornerback Kevin Porter stepped in front of Arkansas quarterback 
Brad Taylor’s intended receiver and raced 35 yards for a touchdown. 
Quarterback Pat Washington ran in for the two-point conversion. 
Porter’s interception was the first of four interceptions the Auburn 
defense recorded in the game. 

Arkansas made the score 14-9 with 11:56 remaining in the game 
when fullback Marshall Foreman scored from two yards out, three 
plays after Arkansas had recovered an Auburn fumble on the Tiger 
6-yard line. The Hogs’ two-point attempt failed. 

Then, with 5:38 remaining to be played, Jackson took a pitch 
around left end and took it 39 
yards for the touchdown to make 
the score 21-9. 

Arkansas scored with 3:10 
remaining in the game on 
a 25-yard pass from Taylor

Cotton Bowl 


Dallas, Texas 


Auburn took its 8-3 regular season record to Dallas, Texas, to face 
SWC Champion Texas A&M in the 50th annual Cotton Bowl Classic. 
The bowl marked the fourth consecutive bowl game for the Tigers 
and the fulfillment of a commitment by the players to play in a New 
Year’s Day contest. 

Heisman Trophy winner Bo Jackson’s five-yard touchdown burst 
early in the first quarter gave the Tigers an early 7-0 lead, but two 
scores by the Aggies gave A&M the lead, 12-7, at the end of the first 
period. 

With 8:28 remaining in the first half, Jackson took a pass from QB 
Pat Washington and raced 73 yards for a touchdown to again give 
Auburn the lead 13-12. But a 26-yard field goal by Aggie PK Scott 
Slater with 50 seconds remaining in the half would give Texas A&M 
the lead for good. 

Auburn managed only a field goal in the second half, a 26-yarder 
by freshman Chris Johnson, 
while Texas A&M romped to a 
36-16 victory. 

Twice in the fourth quarter, 
Auburn failed to convert fourth 
down situations, one halting a 
drive at the Aggie two-yard line. 

QB Pat Washington was two 
of seven for 82 yards and was

Auburn’s January 1 date with Southern California in Orlando’s 
Citrus Bowl marked the fifth consecutive bowl game for the Tigers, the 
third New Year’s Day bowl. 

The Tigers’ 9-2 regular season had left them one victory shy of 
becoming only the fifth team in Auburn history to win 10 games in a 
single season. Auburn’s all-time football record stood at 499 victories. 
A 16-7 triumph over USC, the nation’s winningest bowl team, gave the 
Tigers their 10-2 record and the 500th all-time Auburn win. 

USC was the first on the scoreboard when linebacker Marcus 
Cotton intercepted a Jeff Burger pass and returned it 24 yards for a 
Trojan touchdown. But that would be the only points USC would score 
the rest of the day. 

In the second period, the Tigers culminated an 80-yard drive with 
Burger hitting tight end Walter Reeves with a three-yard touchdown 
pass. With 1:30 remaining in the first half, All-America tailback Brent 
Fullwood ran in from four yards out for a score. PK Chris Knapp 


A 9-1-1 regular-season record and the 1987 Southeastern 
Conference championship earned the Tigers a trip to New Orleans and 
a January 1 date with unbeaten Syracuse in the USF&G Sugar Bowl. 

Sophomore place-kicker Win Lyle’s 30-yard field goal with one 
second remaining in the game gave the Sugar Bowl the first tie in its 
54-year history, a 16-16 deadlock. 

The game that matched the best of the South against the best of the 
East — the sixth-ranked Tigers and the fourth-ranked Orangemen. 
Auburn’s first touchdown was set up on a 58-yard flanker reverse pass 
from wide receiver Duke Donaldson to wide receiver Lawyer Tillman. 
With 5:45 remaining in the first quarter, quarterback Jeff Burger hit 
Tillman for a 17-yard score. 

The Tigers held a 10-7 lead at halftime, but the Orangemen tied it 
at 10-10 by the end of the third 
quarter. Syracuse place-kicker 
Tim Vesling booted field goals

Auburn lost to Florida State 13-7 in one of the most exciting Sugar 
Bowls ever played. The Tigers spotted FSU a 13-0 lead early in the 
second quarter, then came roaring back and almost overtook the 
Seminoles in the final seconds of the game. 

Seminole tailback Sammie Smith became the first back in more than 
two years to gain 100 yards rushing against Auburn. Then the Tigers 
began their run. Auburn scored on a 20-yard pass from Reggie Slack to 
All-America tight end Walter Reeves to cut the FSU lead to six points. 
The Tigers had another first half threat when linebacker Smokey Hodge 
intercepted an FSU pass and returned it to the FSU 25, but a fumble 
at the 12 cost Auburn a scoring opportunity. Time and time again 
in the second half, the Auburn 
defense stopped Florida State 
scoring threats, and with three

Reggie Slack led the No. 9-ranked Tigers to victory on New Year’s 
Day as they defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes. Auburn started off slow 
with Slack throwing two interceptions in the first minutes of play. But 
when Stacy Danley got the wind knocked out of him, the Tigers began 
playing a different game. 

With the Buckeyes leading 14-3 in the second quarter, Shane 
Wasden returned a punt 34 yards to Ohio State’s 33. As the clock was 
ticking down, Slack threw 11 yards to Greg Taylor for a touchdown. 

In their first three possessions in the second half, the Tigers scored 
three times and led OSU 31-14. The big drive came in the second pos- 
session of third quarter with Auburn winning 17-14. The Tigers went 
80 yards in 16 plays. On third and 11 at the OSU 41, Slack threw to 
Wasden for nine yards. He then threw to Alexander Wright on fourth 
and 2. Finally, three plays later, Slack raced up the middle seven yards

Quarterback Stan White put the lid on a late Auburn come-from- 
behind win when he scampered one yard on a fourth-down bootleg to 
lift Auburn to a 27-23 win over Indiana in the 1990 Peach Bowl. 

White’s game-winning touchdown was his second of the day as 
the Tigers finished the 1990 season 8-3-1. For his efforts the freshman 
was named the Offensive MVP of the game. Auburn linebacker Darrel 
Crawford was named the Defensive MVP as the Tigers limited Indiana 
to just 220 yards total offense.

Army’s Joseph Parker’s 27-yard field goal attempt with 29 seconds 
remaining sailed wide right as Auburn held off a late Cadet charge to 
win the 1996 Independence Bowl, 32-29. 

In winning its first bowl game in six years, Auburn utilized the talents 
of quarterback Dameyune Craig. Craig threw for an Independence and 
Auburn bowl record 370 yards while rushing for 75 more in earning 
Offensive MVP honors. 

Craig led Auburn to the game’s first 20 points, throwing touchdown 
strikes to Tyrone Goodson (30 yards) and Willie Gosha (seven yards) 
and setting up a pair of Jaret Holmes field goals. 

Meanwhile, the Tiger defense held Army’s option attack in check for 
most of the first half. The Cadets finally got on the scoreboard when 
Bobby Williams scored with 1:27 remaining in the first half to make it 
20-7 Auburn. 

Auburn built its lead to 32-7 in the third quarter on a 33-yard 
scramble by Craig and an 18-yard burst by Rusty Williams. Two-point 
attempts after both scores failed. 

Army made a valiant come- 
back in the fourth quarter as

made the score 32-29. 

After recovering the ensuing 
on-side kick and moving the ball 
to Auburn’s 10, Army tried the 
27-yard field goal attempt by 
Parker on third down. 


Auburn scored 15 fourth-quarter points to support a tenacious 
Tiger defensive effort in a 21-17 Peach Bowl win over Clemson. 
Auburn trailed 17-6 entering the final stanza, but cut the lead to 17-12 
on Dameyune Craig’s 22-yard scramble early in the quarter. 

Five minutes later, Rusty Williams put the Tigers ahead to stay, 
18-17, with a seven-yard run. Jaret Holmes added a 22-yard field goal, 
his third of the day, with 4:11 left. 

Auburn’s defense dominated the game, holding Clemson under 100 
yards in both rushing (60) and passing (86) and to just 146 yards total. 
Auburn held Clemson to just four first downs and had just one of 14 
third-down attempts converted against it. 

Holmes’ career-long 52-yard 
field goal gave Auburn a 3-0 
with 9:49 left in the first quarter. 
But Clemson took the lead mid- 
way through the second quarter 
after blocking a Holmes’ punt. 
Chad Speck returned the block 
18 yards for a touchdown and a 
7-3 Clemson lead.

The 20th-ranked Auburn Tigers made a late fourth quarter 
charge, but fell short, losing to 17th-ranked Michigan Wolverines, 
31-28, in the Capital One Florida Citrus Bowl. 

The Tigers utilized the arm of senior quarterback Ben Leard, who 
set two Auburn bowl records by throwing for 394 yards and three 
touchdowns. Answering a first quarter 31-yard Wolverine touchdown 
pass from Drew Henson to David Terrell, Leard threw his first of 
touchdown to Ronney Daniels in the second quarter to tie the game at 
7-7. 

Auburn took the lead as Leard hit senior Clifton Robinson on a 
20-yard touchdown with 11:04 before the half. But, Henson connected 
on a four-yard pass to B.J. Askew to tie the game at 14-14. Michigan 
regained the lead on an 11-yard scamper from Anthony Thomas to end 
the first half at 21-14. 

Michigan built its lead to 28-14 in the third quarter as Thomas, 
named the game’s MVP, entered the endzone on a 25-yard burst, his 
longest of the day. Auburn junior running back Rudi Johnson crossed 
the goal line with 4:08 to go in 
the third, to bring Auburn with- 
in seven, 28-21. The Wolverines 
connected on a 41-yard field

A New Year’s Eve invitation to the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl pitted 
7-4 Auburn against 7-5 North Carolina. In a defensive battle, North 
Carolina held off a late fourth quarter charge to beat Auburn, 16-10, in 
the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. 

In the first quarter, North Carolina recovered a fumble and 
returned it 18 yards to the Tiger 10-yard line. Two plays later, North 
Carolina tailback Willie Parker took the ball off right end for the UNC 
touchdown. 

The only other score in the half came when the Tar Heels drove 
the ball 84 yards resulting in a field goal by kicker Jeff Reed. 

North Carolina came out of halftime and added to its lead as 
Peach Bowl offensive MVP QB Ronald Curry scrambled 62 yards for a 
touchdown putting UNC ahead 16-0. 

The Auburn defense responded well, not allowing any more 
points for the rest of the game and treated football fans to a play that 
will be remembered in Auburn football history. 

An errant Darian Durant pass was snatched out of the air by whip 
Karlos Dansby as he was falling out of bounds. Dansby then tossed the 
ball to linebacker Dontarrious Thomas to complete an amazing inter- 
ception. The play was later nominated for the ESPY Awards’ “Most 
Spectacular Play” of the year.

On a warm and windy day in Orlando, the 19th-ranked Auburn 
Tigers knocked off 10th-ranked Penn State behind a stymieing defense 
and Capital One Bowl MVP Ronnie Brown’s 184-yard, two-touchdown 
performance. Penn State’s Larry Johnson, who finished third in the 
Heisman Trophy balloting, was unable to get on track as Auburn’s 
defense limited him to only 72 yards on 20 carries. 

Auburn fumbled on its first possession giving Penn State the ball 
on the 15-yard line, but the Nittany Lions were forced to settle for a 
21-yard Robbie Gould field goal. 

The Auburn defense held the Nittany Lion offense the rest of the 
half, allowing only a 27-yard field goal by Gould. 

After a sluggish first half, the Tigers came out in the third quarter 
with a run-dominated offensive scheme and Ronnie Brown punished 
the Penn State defenders to the tune of 119 second half yards. 

Auburn took its first possession of the second half and marched 74 
yards, scoring on a one-yard Brown touchdown run, which put Auburn 
ahead, 7-6. The fast Tiger defense took control, allowing Penn State 
only 31 yards of offense in the third quarter. 

Penn State replaced quarterback Zack Mills with Michael 
Robinson, who sparked the Nittany Lion offense to a fourth quarter 
field goal, putting Penn State up 9-7. 

On Auburn’s next possession, Damon Duval’s punt was downed 
at the one-yard line pinning Penn State deep in their own territory. 

After a short punt by Penn State, Auburn drove the ball inside the 

red zone, where Ronnie Brown 


With the combination of a stellar defensive performance that 
included six sacks and the leadership of MVP Jason Campbell, Auburn 
put together 14 fourth-quarter points en route to a 28-14 Music City 
Bowl win over Wisconsin. 

After a scoreless first period, Wisconsin started the second quarter 
by driving to the Auburn seven-yard line where the Badgers had a first 
and goal, but Auburn’s defense forced Wisconsin to settle for a 20-yard 
field goal for a 3-0 lead. 

Auburn responded on the next drive as Ronnie Brown gained 43 
yards on six carries culminating with a one-yard touchdown to give the 
Tigers a 7-3 lead. Wisconsin managed another field goal before the half 
to make the score 7-6 at the intermission. 

Auburn struck first in the second half, going 80 yards on 16 plays 
and taking 7:16 off the clock. Carnell Williams finished the drive with a 
one-yard plunge up the middle for the touchdown. 

In the fourth quarter, Jim Sorgi led Wisconsin on a 52-yard drive, 
capping it with a 12-yard pass to Lee Evans for a touchdown and a two- 
point conversion pass to tie the game at 14. 

The Badgers seemed to have the momentum in their favor until 
Carlos Rogers deflected a pass that Will Herring intercepted on the 
Auburn 13-yard line. Two plays later, Campbell connected with Jeris 
McIntyre on third and eight for a 51-yard gain to the Wisconsin 34-yard 
line. It took Auburn just three more plays to put it in the end zone as 
Brown scored for the second time from two yards out.

Auburn completed a perfect season as the No. 3 Tigers held off a 
late Virginia Tech rally for a 16-13 victory in the NOKIA Sugar Bowl at 
the Louisiana Superdome. The win improved the Tigers’ record to 13-0 
and ensured the first 13-win season in school history. 

Auburn, just the seventh team to go undefeated in league play 
since the Southeastern Conference went to divisional play in 1992, 
jumped out to a 16-0 lead in the first three quarters before the Hokies 
got on the board. Two late fourth-quarter scores allowed Virginia 
Tech back into the game, but an onside kick with two minutes left was 
recovered by the Tigers. 

Jason Campbell, voted the NOKIA Sugar Bowl’s Most Valuable 
Player, threw for 189 yards on 11-of-16 passing and one score. 
Campbell, who played his last game in an Auburn uniform, connected 
with Devin Aromashodu on a 5-yard touchdown pass late in the third 
quarter, giving the Tigers a 16-0 advantage. 

The tandem of senior running backs Ronnie Brown and Carnell 
Williams rushed for 68 and 61 yards, respectively. 

Placekicker John Vaughn connected on three field goals in the 
first half from 23, 19 and 24 yards to send the Tigers to a 9-0 lead 
entering halftime. The three field goals tied an Auburn record in a bowl 
game, last set by Jaret Holmes at the 1998 Peach Bowl. 

After Campbell connected with Aromashodu for a 16-0 AU lead, 
Virginia Tech’s Josh Morgan found the end zone twice -- the first on a 
29-yard reception from Bryan Randall and the second on an 80-yarder 

with two minutes to play.

Brian Calhoun rushed for 213 yards and one touchdown and John 
Stocco passed for 301 yards and two scores as Wisconsin defeated Auburn, 
24-10, in the 2006 Capital One Bowl. The loss snapped Auburn’s three- 
game bowl winning streak. 

Wisconsin took a 17-0 lead into halftime, but the Tigers scored 10 
straight points to pull within 17-10 early in the fourth quarter. Brandon 
Cox found Courtney Taylor for a 9-yard score at the 14:49 mark of the 
fourth to pull Auburn within seven. 

However, Calhoun rushed for a 33-yard touchdown less than two 
minutes later, giving the Badgers the final 24-10 outcome. 

Cox finished 15-of-33 for 137 yards and one touchdown, while Kenny 
Irons rushed for 88 yards -- giving him 1,293 on the season - the sixth-best 
single-season mark in Auburn history. 

Ben Obomanu ended his Auburn career with five receptions for 62 
yards. His senior counterpart, Anthony Mix, caught two passes for 11 
yards, giving him 1,010 yards in his career. 

Wisconsin opened the game’s scoring when Stocco found Brandon 
Williams on a 30-yard reception at the 7:55 mark of the first quarter. 

UW’s Taylor Mehlhaff connected on his only field goal of the day, a 
19-yarder, at the end of the first quarter, then watched as Stocco found 
Owen Daniels for a 13-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter. 

John Vaughn connected on a 19-yard field goal, his 12th of the season, 
in the third quarter to put Auburn 
on the board. 

Defensively, David Irons led 
the Tigers with 11 tackles.

Dallas, Texas 


John Vaughn’s 42-yard field goal in the third quarter proved to be the 
game winner as Auburn took the 71st AT&T Cotton Bowl Classic with a 
17-14 victory over Nebraska in Dallas. 

Vaughn connected on his 20th field goal of the season at the 6:20 mark 
of the third quarter, the game’s only points of the second half, to give 
Auburn its 11th win of the season for the fourth time in school history. 

The Auburn defense was stout against Nebraska, limiting the 
Cornhuskers to just 230 yards of total offense, including 73 in the second 
half. Karibi Dede began the defense’s dominance in the first half, intercept- 
ing a Zac Taylor pass and returning it 52 yards to the Nebraska 9-yard line. 

Just two plays later, the Auburn offense punched it in the end zone 
when Brandon Cox found Carl Stewart for a 9-yard score with 56 seconds 
remaining in the first quarter, evening the score at 7. 

Early in the second quarter, the Tigers recovered a fumble at the 
Cornhuskers’ 14 on a failed fake punt attempt. Four plays later, Stewart 
scored his second TD on a 1-yard run. 

After Vaughn’s third quarter field goal, the Huskers managed to get in 
Auburn territory just twice. They punted from Auburn’s 34 in the third 
quarter, and Taylor threw a fourth-down incompletion from Auburn’s 30 
late in the fourth quarter. 

The Tiger defense finished with two sacks and 11 tackles for loss, high- 
lighted by Sen’Derrick Marks’ 2.5 TFL. Will Herring finished with seven 
solo tackles, including two for loss, and was named the game’s outstanding

Kodi Burns scored on a 7-yard run in overtime to lift No. 22 
Auburn to a 23-20 victory over No. 15 Clemson in the Chick-fil-A 
Bowl, in the first overtime game in Auburn’s bowl history. 

Burns’ score put the finishing touches on a performance that saw 
the Tigers record season highs in plays and yards with a spread offense. 
Auburn ran 90 plays for 423 yards, including 47 rushes and a season- 
high 43 passes. 

Auburn scored first in a low-scoring first half, following a three- 
and-out by Clemson on the opening possession with an 11-play, 
58-yard drive that culminated in Wes Byrum’s 36-yard field goal. 

After managing just 52 yards of offense in the first quarter, 
Clemson’s C.J. Spiller raced 83 yards down the left sideline to give 
Clemson a 7-3 lead. 

Auburn took the opening kickoff in the second half and marched 
78 yards on 10 plays as Burns hit Mario Fannin with a 22-yard pass to 
give Auburn a 10-7 lead. 

Clemson finished an 11-play drive with a 22-yard field goal on the 
first play of the fourth quarter, knotting the score at 10-10. 

After Cox was intercepted, Clemson quickly drove 32 yards for the 
go-ahead score when James Davis plunged in from a yard out with 
11:24 remaining. 

Auburn answered right back, again mixing Cox and Burns in 


defensive player.

Nebraska started the game’s 
scoring on a Nate Swift 13-yard 
touchdown reception from Taylor 
at the 7:37 mark of the first quarter. 

With Auburn up 14-7 after 
Stewart's second quarter touch- 
down run, Brandon Jackson

then snuck ahead for two yards 
and the first down. Two plays 
later, Burns powered in for the 
score, sending the Auburn side- 
line into a frenzy. 

Cox connected on 25-of-39 
passes for 211 yards in his final 
game for Auburn. 

The Auburn defense, led by

Neiko Thorpe tackled Zeke Markshausen at the Auburn 2-yard line on a 
fake field goal attempt from the 5-yard line to preserve Auburn’s 38-35 overtime 
victory over Northwestern after Wes Byrum’s 21-yard field goal gave the Tigers 
the lead. 

With the score tied 21-21, Ben Tate rushed for two touchdowns in the first 
eight minutes of the fourth quarter. The first came from 5 yards out with 10:10 
left and the second was a 7-yard run that seemed to put the Tigers in control, 
35-21 with 7:32 left. 

Northwestern closed to 35-27 on a 2-yard Kafka touchdown run with 3:20 
remaining but the PAT was blocked by Antonio Coleman. With Auburn trying 
to run out the clock, Brad Phillips forced a Tate fumble at the Northwestern 
31 with 3:11 to play. The Wildcats then drove 69 yards to score on a 18-yard 
touchdown pass from Kafka to Sidney Stewart with 1:15 to play and a tied the 
game on a successful two-point conversion. 

Auburn’s Demond Washington returned the ensuing kickoff to midfield 
before he fumbled, giving the ball back to the Wildcats with 1:03 to play. 
Northwestern then drove to the Auburn 26 where Demos missed a potential 


game-winning 44-yard field goal as time expired. 
Auburn’s defense picked off five Northwestern passes, with Walter

2011 BCS National Championship 


Oregon 19 


Auburn 22 
January 10, 2011 
University of Phoenix Stadium 


Glendale, Arizona 


Wes Byrum kicked the sixth and biggest game-winning field goal of his 
career on the last play of the game from 19 yards to give No. 1 Auburn a 22-19 
victory over Oregon in the BCS National Championship Game. It was Auburn’s 
second national title in history and ninth comeback win in 14 games during the 
2010 season. 

After Oregon had tied the score at 19 with a touchdown and two point 
conversion with 2:33 to go, the biggest drive in Auburn history began at its own 
25-yard line. After a 15-yard pass from Cam Newton to Emory Blake, Michael 
Dyer, who was named the Offensive Player of the Game after rushing for 143 
yards on 22 carries, looked to be tackled after a short gain, but was never down 
while laying on top of an Oregon defender, and he bounced up to complete a 
37-yard run to the Oregon 23. 

After short gains by Dyer and Newton, Dyer followed with a 16-yard gain 
up the middle to the 1 with 10 seconds remaining. One play later, Byrum pro- 
vided the final heroics. 

Oregon scored on the second play of the second quarter on a 26-yard field 
goal by Rob Beard for the first points of the game. On Auburn’s next possession, 
Newton threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to Kodi Burns for a 7-3 Auburn lead. 

Oregon responded after taking over at the Duck 7 as Thomas threw an 
81-yard pass on first down to Meahl, then found James on an 8-yard TD pass. A 
2-point conversion run by kicker Rob Beard on a fake gave Oregon an 11-7 lead. 

The Tigers then drove to the Oregon 1, but Newton’s fourth-down pass to 
Eric Smith fell incomplete. On first down, Mike Blanc tackled James in the end 
zone for a safety to draw the Tigers to within 11-9 with 3:26 left in the half. 

After Oregon kicked off following 
the safety, Auburn quickly covered 
66 yards in six plays, capped by a 
Newton to Blake 30-yard touchdown

87th Homecoming football game comes to Jordan-Hare October 12, 
when Auburn hosts Western Carolina. 

Homecoming at Auburn began in June 1913, when Dr. Charles 
Thach, president of what was then Alabama Polytechnic Institute, 
issued a proclamation calling for “the observance of a Homecoming 
for all those loyal sons who, as former Auburn students, have passed 
through her portals and received her honors.” 

Homecoming festivities were held in connection with the spring 
commencement exercises until 1924. Auburn beat Clemson, 13-0, in 
Auburn’s first Homecoming game. The game was played on old Drake 
Field, which is now the parking lot for Haley Center. 

Until the first section of Jordan-Hare Stadium was completed in 
1939, Auburn sometimes observed Homecoming in Montgomery or 
Columbus, Ga., since adequate campus facilities were not available. 
Auburn did not have Homecoming games in 1930 and 1938. There was 
no football team in 1943 due to WWIL. 

Auburn is 73-8-5 at Homecoming. Mississippi State (16 times) has 
been the most common Homecoming guest.

The Deep South's Oldest Rivalry 


Auburn and Georgia have met 116 times in 
the Deep South’s oldest rivalry. The two teams 
first met in 1892 when they played the first col- 
lege football game in Southern history. 


DEEP SOUTH’S OLDEST RIVALRY 
The Auburn-Georgia series is tied with 

Oregon-Oregon State as the seventh-most 

played series in the nation (Football Bowl 

Subdivision). The FBS series with the most 

games played are listed below:

ROAD-FIELD ADVANTAGE 

The Auburn-Georgia series has taken hos- 
pitality to a new level. Auburn owns a winning 
record in Athens (18-12) while Georgia has 
a winning mark on the Plains (15-10-2). The 
Tigers have won nine of their last 14 games at 
Sanford Stadium and Georgia has won on six of 
its last nine trips to Jordan-Hare Stadium. 

Former Auburn coach Terry Bowden 
never beat Georgia in Auburn (0-1-1), but 
never lost to the Bulldogs in Athens (3-0), 
Tommy Tuberville had a better road record 
(3-2) than home record (2-3) against Georgia 
and Pat Dye had a better record in Athens (4-2) 
than he did against Georgia in Auburn (3-3). 

Even legendary Georgia coach Vince 
Dooley (1964-88), an Auburn graduate, had 
better success against the Tigers in Auburn 
(7-5-1) than he did in Athens (4-8). 


MORE AU-UGA SERIES NOTES 

Through 116 meetings, Georgia has out- 
scored Auburn by just 114 points (1,892-1,778) 
.. In games decided by three points or less, 
Auburn leads, 8-5-8 ... In games decided by 
seven points or less, Georgia leads, 23-19-8 ... 
The 2009 contest marked the first time in 19 
meetings and just the second time in 33 years 
that one or both schools have not been ranked 
in the Associated Press poll when playing each 
other ... The last time that neither team was 
ranked entering the game was in 1991 ... In the 
last 16 meetings between the two schools when 
at least one team was ranked, the lower ranked 
or unranked team won seven times (UGA- 
1996, AU-1997, AU-1999, AU-2000, AU-2001, 
AU-2005, UGA-2006), with the higher ranked 
team winning just nine (UGA-1998, UGA-2002, 
UGA-2003, AU-2004, UGA-2007, UGA-2008, 
AU-2010, UGA-2011, UGA-2012) ... Auburn 
has had more individual 150-yard rushing per- 
formances against Georgia (10) than any other 
opponent ... The Tigers had a stretch of at 
least one rushing touchdown in 20 consecutive 


games against Georgia, and 31 of the last 32 in 
the series, snapped in 2009. 


OLD SERIES 

World war has been the only thing strong 
enough to keep Auburn and Georgia from 
playing football. The two teams did not play in 
1943, only because Auburn did not field a team 
due to World War II. The two teams did not 
play in 1917 and 1918 because of WWI. With 
those two exceptions, Auburn and Georgia 
have played continuously since 1898. 

The Auburn-Georgia series (115 games) 
is older than the Georgia-Georgia Tech series 
(106 games) and the Auburn-Alabama series 
(756 games). Auburn and Georgia first played 
in 1892. They first played their intrastate rivals 
in 1893. 


CHANGING TIMES 

The 2009 Auburn-Georgia game in Athens 
had a sellout crowd and a gate of more than $1 
million. 

Ralph “Shug” Jordan, who was an assistant 
at Georgia before becoming Auburn’s win- 
ningest head coach, often used the Auburn- 
Georgia series, his favorite rivalry, as an exam- 
ple of the growth of college football. 

One of his favorite stories was how gate 
receipts from early Auburn-Georgia games 
were divided. It involved Auburn’s Cliff Hare 
and Georgia’s Charles Herty, their friendship 
and the relationship between the two schools 
that brought college football to the Deep South. 

“They would come to Dean Hare’s house 
on Gay Street in Auburn after the game in 
Columbus to divide the money,” Jordan said. 
“They would take the gate receipts out of an old 
cigar box, spread it on the kitchen table and say, 
‘a dollar for you and a dollar for us’ until the 
game proceeds were divided equally between 
the two schools.” 

Today, it takes a team of accountants 
in Auburn, Athens and the SEC office in 
Birmingham weeks to do what two gentlemen, 
Hare and Herty, used to do in a matter of min- 
utes. 


HONORED FOES 

Of Auburn’s major rivals whose games 
were once played at neutral sites, Georgia is the 
only school to come to Auburn without argu- 
ment. In fact, both Auburn and Georgia used 
a home-and-home AU-UGA series as the base 
for major stadium additions. 

Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia Tech 
all indicated they would drop Auburn rather 
than play at what was then known as Cliff Hare 
Stadium. 


UGA 56, AU 49: AN SEC FIRST 

The 1996 Auburn-Georgia game, the 
100th in the series, was the first SEC game ever 
to go into overtime. Georgia won 56-49 in four 
OTs. It was the longest game in SEC history, 
until the 2001 Arkansas-Ole Miss game that 
lasted seven overtime periods. 

Auburn and Georgia have split two over- 
time games between the two schools. Georgia 
claimed the 1996, four-overtime contest, with 
Auburn claiming a 29-26 overtime victory at 
Jordan-Hare Stadium in 2000. 


WILLIAMS SETS RECORD IN 2001 

In 2001’s 24-17 win in Athens, then- 
freshman Carnell Williams set a new Auburn 
record when he carried the ball 41 times against 
Georgia. Williams’ 41 carries broke the old 
record of 38 set by both Stacy Danley (1988) 
and Bo Jackson (1985). For the game, Williams 
rushed for 167 yards and two touchdowns and 
was named the SEC Player of the Week follow- 
ing his performance. 


100-YARD RUSHERS VERSUS UGA 

Since 1970, Auburn has had 25 100-yard 
rushing performances against Georgia, includ- 
ing two 100-yard rushers in three games (1974, 
‘78, 79). The Tigers have had a 100-yard rusher 
in six of the last 12 years. Rudi Johnson gained 
152 yards in 2000, Carnell Williams followed 
with 167 yards in 2001, Ronnie Brown ran for 
124 yards in 2002, Williams went for 101 in 
2004 and Kenny Irons rushed for 179 yards 
in 2005. Cam Newton rushed for 151 yards in 
2010. From 1982-85, Auburn had four straight 
100-yard rushers vs. the Bulldogs when the feat 
was accomplished by Lionel James (1982, 8-111, 
TD), Bo Jackson (1983, 18-118), Tommie Agee 
(1984, 9-115) and Jackson (19-121, 2 TD). 


309 | AUBURN FOOTBALL HISTORY & RECORDS| 309 


Auburn-Alabama. Alabama-Auburn. In the 
heart of Dixie, whichever way you look at it, you 
live it 365 days a year. The passion is unparalleled 
in all of collegiate athletics. 

The series between Auburn and Alabama 
began on Feb. 22, 1893, when the two teams met 
for the first time at Birmingham’s Lakeview Park. 
An estimated 2,000 fans were in attendance that 
day to see the Auburn Orange and Blue defeat the 
Alabama Crimsons 32-22. Thus, began a rivalry 
that is the nation’s fiercest. 

Disagreements between the schools started 
immediately after their first game. Alabama 
includes the loss as the last game of the 1892 
season while Auburn puts the victory as the first 
game of the 1893 season. It was the first of many 
disputes that has made the rivalry more than just 
a football game. 

The rivalry went on 41-year hiatus after the 
teams met for the 12th time in 1907. The schools 
became involved in what seemed to be a minor 
dispute involving teams’ expenses and officiating. 
Neither team could agree on how much money 
each player should be allotted for the team’s trip 
to Birmingham for the game. A disagreement on 
what section of the country the officials should 
come from also existed. 

Auburn wanted an expense of $3.50 per day 
for its 22 players while Alabama offered just $3.00 
per day for 20 Auburn players. Also, Auburn 
head coach Mike Donahue wanted a Northerner 
to officiate the game, while the Alabama coaching 
staff demanded a Southern man call the game. 
Both sides blamed each other and the small dis- 
pute turned into a 41-year drought in the series. 

People across the state wanted an end to 
the dispute, but both schools disregarded the 
idea of a football game. In 1923, Auburn presi- 
dent Dr. Spright Dowell, said the game should 
not be played because “football would tend to 
become the all-the-topic of both institutions.” 
Consequently, in 1944, the University of Alabama 
Board of Trustees said the game would “result in 
an accelerated over-emphasis of football in the 
state.“ 

It took a resolution by the Alabama House of 
Representatives to renew the rivalry. In 1947, the 
Alabama House wrote a resolution that encour- 
aged the schools to “make possible the inaugura- 
tion of a full athletic program between the two 
schools.” On April 22, 1948, Auburn president 
Dr. Ralph Draughon and Alabama president 
Dr. John M. Gallalee met to discuss the recom- 
mendation. The two met again on May 2 and 
an agreement was reached between the schools. 
The teams renewed the series on Dec. 4, 1948, at 
Birmingham’s Legion Field. Alabama defeated the 
Tigers 55-0 to begin the rivalry a second time. 

From 1950 to 1963, defense was the key to the 
game as the losing team never scored more than 
eight points in a game. Nine shutouts were regis- 
tered in the 13-year span, with Alabama winning 
six of those games. Alabama’s most prosperous 
years in the series were from 1960 to 1981 as the 
Tide amassed an 18-4 record against the Tigers. 
Alabama currently holds a 40-34-1 advantage in 
the series, mainly due to nine consecutive victo- 
ries over Auburn from 1973 to 1981. Auburn’s 
longest winning streak against Alabama is six 
games, 2002-07. 


The Iron Bowl 


To Auburn people, one of the most incredible 
Auburn-Alabama games came on Dec. 2, 1972. A 
few days before the game, Alabama head coach 
Bear Bryant incited the rivalry when he told 
reporters that he would rather, “beat that cow col- 
lege once than beat Texas 10 times.” That set the 
stage as second-ranked Alabama brought a 10-0 
record into Legion Field to meet the ninth-ranked 
Tigers, who were 8-1. 

For the entire game, Bama’s defense held the 
Auburn offense in check. With 5:30 remaining 
in the game, 16-point favorite Alabama held a 
seemingly insurmountable 16-3 lead. The Tigers, 
perhaps fueled by Bryant’s remarks, came roar- 
ing back for one of the best finishes in Auburn- 
Alabama history. Auburn’s Bill Newton blocked 
two Alabama punts and David Langer ran both 
in for touchdowns as Auburn came back to win 
17-16. Newton and Langer will forever be remem- 
bered by Auburn fans for their play in the now 
famous “Punt Bama Punt” game. 

Though Alabama dominated the series through 
the 60s and 70s, the rivalry reached new heights 
in the 80s as the average margin of victory was a 
mere 6.4 points. Some classic battles were waged 
in the decade. Two games that epitomize the 
series came in 1985 and 1986. Auburn won the 
1986 meeting on a Lawyer Tillman reverse into 
the endzone with 32 seconds remaining to down 
Bama 21-17. Alabama won the 1985 game, 25-23, 
on a 52-yard Van Tiffin field goal as the clock 
expired. 

A historic new page was added to the rivalry in 
1989 when Alabama came to Auburn’s Jordan- 
Hare Stadium for the first time. The game was 
held on Dec. 2, 1989, exactly 17 years after the 
Tigers 1972 miracle win over the Tide. Just like 
the 1972 meeting, Bama came into the game 
with a 10-0 record and a No. 2 ranking. Before 
a Jordan-Hare Stadium record crowd of 85,319, 
Auburn ended Alabama’s national title hopes 
with a monumental 30-20 victory. 

The Auburn-Alabama game has been played 
in five different cities and eight different stadi- 
ums, but since the rivalry was renewed in 1948, 
the game has been played either at Legion Field, 
Bryant-Denney or Jordan-Hare Stadium. 

In 2000, an old chapter in the storied rivalry 
was re-opened as Auburn returned to Tuscaloosa 
for the first time since 1901. Rain, sleet and 
freezing temperatures greeted the Tigers in their 
first-ever visit to Bryant-Denny Stadium. The 
Tigers prevailed with a 9-0 victory and not only 
avenged the Tigers’ first-ever loss to the Tide in 
Auburn the year before, but also clinched the SEC 
Western Division title and its second trip to the 
SEC Championship game. 

From 2002-07, Auburn reeled off a school- 
record six-consecutive victories over Alabama, 
including a 21-13 victory in 2004 in Tuscaloosa en 
route to a perfect 13-0 season. The following year, 
Auburn sacked Alabama quarterbacks a schoo- 
record 11 times in a 28-18 win. 

In 2010, Alabama raced to a 24-0 first-half lead 
at Bryant-Denny Stadium before the Tigers rallied 
for a 28-27 victory. The 24-point deficit marked 
the biggest comeback in school history and was a 
defining moment in Auburn’s 2010 BCS National 
Championship season.

The ODK-James E. Foy V 
Sportsmanship Trophy 


On July 13, 1948, the two circles of Omicorn Delta 
Kappa, national leadership honor society, from the 
University of Alabama and Auburn joined together to 
sponsor a trophy devoted to sportsmanship between the 
two universities. The ODK-James E. Foy V Sportsmanship 
Trophy is a tradition which symbolizes the good relation- 
ship which resulted in the renewal of the rivalry between 
the two schools. 

The trophy is awarded to the winner of the football 
game at the half time of the Auburn-Alabama basketball 
game on their home court. The trophy remains in their 
care until the next year’s presentation. 

In January 1978, the trophy was dedicated to Dean 
James E. Foy V upon his retirement as the Deam of 
Student Affairs at Auburn University. He began serving 
in this position in 1950 after serving as Assistant Dean of 
Students at the University of Alabama. 


Auburn-Alabama Notes
