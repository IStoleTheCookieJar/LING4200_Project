without the landlord’s permission. 

@ Allows only two persons per bedroom, 
except for children born during the 
lease period. 

@ Allows county courts to order quick 
removal of renters involved in criminal 
activity, even without a conviction. 


WRITTEN AGREEMENT 

An agreement to rent for one year or 
more must be in writing and signed by the 
tenant and landlord. If either fails to 
follow terms in this legal contract, that 
person can be sued. 

To avoid problems, understand the 
lease. Also, put it in writing who has to 
mow the lawn, fix a clogged sink or pay 
the utility bills. Do not rely on what 
someone says. 


Before signing a lease: 

WM Read everything and ask questions. 
Once you sign, you cannot get out of a 
lease because you didn’t understand it. 

@ Ask for changes in terms you don’t 
like. You have this right. But the 
landlord also has the right to refuse. If 
you decide to sign and lease changes 
are made, the landlord and tenant both 
should put their initials by the written 
changes to show agreement. 


¥Y Amount of security deposit and 
conditions for its return. 


Before you move in, make a list of 
damages or needed repairs. Give a copy 
to the landlord and then file a copy with 
your lease agreement. This will ensure the 
security deposit is not withheld to repair 
damage you did not cause. 


AGREEMENT WITHOUT LEASE 

Even without a lease, a landlord must 
give one month’s written notice to raise 
rent or evict a tenant. Likewise, a tenant 
must give a written notice at least one 
month in advance of moving. Just telling 
a landlord you are leaving is not enough. 
Without written notice, a landlord may 
continue to bill you for rent even after 
you have moved. 


SECURITY DEPOSIT 

@ A landlord cannot take more than two 
months’ rent as a security deposit. 

Mi The landlord has 30 days to return the 
deposit at the end of the lease. If all is 
not returned, the landlord must give 
you a list of damages for which the 
deposit will be used. 

Mi The landlord must tell you the time and 
date of the move-out inspection. You 
have the right to attend the inspection, 
which must be held during regular 
business hours. 


M@ You cannot use the deposit to pay the 
last month’s rent. 


deposit to pay for damages, unpaid 
rent, or lost rent caused by the tenant 
moving without adequate notice. 

@ If a landlord wrongfully withholds all 
or part of a deposit, you may sue to 
recover up to twice the amount 
withheld. 


Repairs — who pays? 

M@ A lease should state which repairs are 
the landlord’s responsibility and which 
are the tenant’s. 

@ Tenants should pay for damages they 
or a guest cause. 

@ The landlord should pay for repairs 
caused by normal wear and tear and 
natural forces such as the weather. 

M@ If repairs are needed, ask the landlord. 
If repairs are not made in reasonable 
time, put your request in writing and 
keep a copy. If repairs still are not 
made, you may seek legal help. 

@ A tenant cannot legally withhold rent 
until repairs are done. You can get 
evicted. 

Wi If the dwelling becomes unsafe, you 
should contact local health or housing 
authorities. 


CANNOT 
DISCRIMINATE 
Landlords cannot refuse 
to sell, rent, sublease, 
charge higher rent or 
falsely state that housing 
is not available based on 
your race, color, religion, 
sex, disability, national 
origin or family 
relationships.

for used cars 


BUYING A CAR is a big step, and a 
mistake can be costly. If you buy a used 
car, make sure it is reliable. There is no 
state law allowing a buyer to return a car 
and get a full or partial refund. 


BUYERS GUIDE 

One of the most important 
things to notice is the 
Buyers Guide. By law, 
dealers must display this 
guide in the window of 
each used car. This 
shows the vehicle make, 
model, year and 
identification number. It also has a 
section where “warranty” or “as is — 
no warranty” is checked.

Y Warranty: The dealer promises to pay 
for some or all car repairs during the 
warranty period. There are two choices: 


Full warranty: The dealer 
provides free repair during the 
warranty period. However, the 
dealer may specify which systems 
are covered, such as the brake 
system. If you aren’t sure what is 
covered, ask. 


Limited warranty: The buyer pays 
for part of the repairs. The dealer 
must put in writing what percent he 
will pay and list the systems 
covered and for how long (in days 
or miles). 


V As is — no warranty: The buyer pays 
for repairs. Have a mechanic check the car 
before buying it. 
(Most cars sold privately through 
individuals are sold “as is.” 


Know how to shop 


Repairing cars 


Car repair is one of the top 
consumer complaints made to the 
Attorney General’s Office. Most 
complaints involve overcharging, 
poor work and deceptive repair 
practices. Here’s how to avoid 
many problems: 


¥Y Check out a shop’s reputation. 
Ask friends and call the Better 
Business Bureau. 


¥ Tell the mechanic what the 
specific problem is. Ask 
questions if you don't 
understand something. 


¥Y Get in writing how much the job 
should cost. Tell the mechanic 
to call for an OK before making 
any repairs not listed in the 
repair estimate. 


¥Y Get a second opinion if you 
think the mechanic wants to do 
unnecessary work. 


V If parts must be replaced, 
request that the old parts be 
returned. Put this in writing on 
the repair order before work 
begins. 

¥ Find out if there is a diagnostic 
charge. 

¥ If the work is guaranteed, get it 
in writing. 


V If your car is covered by a 
warranty, make sure the repair 
shop will honor it. 


Managing your

& purchases

When 
shopping for a 
used car, here 
are questions 
you can ask. 
There is no 
state law that 
allows a buyer 
to return a car 
and get a full 
or partial 
refund. Ask 
what the 
dealer’s policy 
is. Individuals 
usually sell a 
car “as is.” 


Checklist for

when shopping for a used car

under warranty, if any? 


How long does the warranty last? 


Can my own mechanic check 
a car if | decide to buy one? 


How many people have owned the car? 


Has the car been in any accidents? 


What major repairs has the car had — 
have any original parts been replaced? 


Can you give me the name and phone number 
of the most recent owner (then call them)? 


Do you know the Blue Book value of the car’? 


What is your asking price? 


What is the best price you can give me? 


If | buy the car and don’t like how it runs, 
can | return it and get my money back? 


(If answer is “yes,” get the agreement in writing before buying.)

Know how to handle mail, 
phone, other solicitations 


TELEMARKETING FRAUD 
527 Criminals have found an easy 
way to get into your home 
and your pocket — the 
telephone. Con artists are cheating 
consumers out of more than $40 billion a 
year by offering phony prizes, cheap 
products and using high-pressure sales 
tactics. Don’t be caught off guard: 


@ If it’s free — it’s free. If you are told 
you have won a great prize but you 
must pay an up-front fee, shipping 
charge or tax — hang up. The prize 
will not be worth the money sent to 
claim it. 


@ Hang up on offers to buy tickets in 
foreign lotteries. It is against the law to 
buy lottery tickets by phone or mail. 


@ Don’t be pressured into acting if you 
are told an offer is good for today only. 


@ Watch out when someone asks for 
your credit card, bank account or 
Social Security number. This 
information can be misused by the 
wrong people. 


@ Ask for written information. A 
legitimate company will be glad to 
send you information. Don’t do 
business by phone with strangers. 


| THIEF IN YOUR MAILBOX 
w@| Reaching you through the mail 
| 1s another way con artists take 
your money. 


® Don’t fall for letters that look official, 
urgent or are in an envelope that looks 
like an important telegram. These 
gimmicks are used to get your attention 
or look legitimate. 


® Beware of pyramid schemes and chain 
letters. Both solicitations offer a “get- 
rich-quick”’ scheme promising little 
work, few or no “sales” of product and 
big money when you recruit others. 
These schemes are illegal and always 
fail. 
Pyramids make money for those who 
start them at the expense of their 
recruits. Pyramid schemes often 
pretend to be multi-level marketing 
organizations. If there is no product or 
most of your money is made by 
recruiting, this is illegal. 


@ Know the law and the odds when 


entering sweepstakes. It is illegal for a 
company to require a purchase to enter. 
Odds of winning in some large 
sweepstakes are about as likely as 
being one of 10 people chosen on earth.

CREDIT IS CONVENIENT BUT IT COSTS 

Whether applying for a credit card or a 
payday loan, you first need to figure out 
how much your borrowing will ultimately 
cost and how large your payments will 
be. 

Lenders or credit card companies can 
help you figure out your monthly bills — 
based on how long it will take you to 
repay, the interest rate and the amount of 
payment. 


TYPES OF RATES 

A “variable” interest rate can increase 
or decrease. Many home loans and credit 
cards have these rates. While it is tougher 
to figure the final cost for these loans, the 
lender can help. 

Beware of low, short-term “fixed” 
rates. To attract new customers, many 
credit card companies offer low rates that 
last only a few months. If you have a card 
with a low rate, be aware that some 
companies may charge a high fee or 
bump your interest rate to a higher level if 
a payment is late. 


Know how to handle 
credit card, other loans 


TYPES OF LOANS 


PAWNBROKERS 

Pawnbrokers lend money for a set time 
in exchange for collateral such as a 
watch. If you repay the loan, you will get 
back your property. If you don’t, 
pawnbrokers will keep your property and 
probably sell it. 


Under Missouri law, pawnbrokers: 

® Cannot charge more than 2 percent 
interest per month on the loan amount 
plus any storage fees. 

® Must give a receipt describing your 
pawned items and stating the full 
amount you owe. 

® Can lend money for only 30 days at a 
time. The loan can be extended as many 
times as you and the pawnbroker agree. 

® Cannot sell your property until 60 
days after the date your loan repayment 
was due. You may pay off your loan 
during this time but must pay 
additional interest for the late time. 

@® Must use reasonable care to protect 
your property and usually must replace 
lost or damaged property if you have 
paid the full amount due. 

@ Will not lend you the full value of the 
property you pledge.

Chapter 


As you have learned through this course, 
there are numerous laws to protect 
consumers. Laws, however, do not cover 
every situation. In fact, many times 
people have misconceptions about how 
and when they are protected by 
consumer laws. The following are some 
misconceptions that have caused 
concern to consumers. You should learn 
to separate the myths from the facts. 
The following list of seven common 
misunderstandings will help keep you 
from making expensive mistakes. 


Wihaisee ee You have three days in 
Missouri to return a car after buying it 
and still get a refund. 


FACT: There is no state law that allows 
a consumer to buy a car and then return 
it and obtain a partial or full refund. 
Before buying, check to see if the dealer 
has a policy on car returns. 


ih a@useeae A store has to give you a 
refund if you request one. 


FACT: Missouri has no law on refund or 
layaway policies. Stores set their 
policies. 


Giving out your credit card 
number as an ID or other similar 
purpose is OK as long as you don’t 
authorize a charge. 


FACT: Using credit cards as an ID can 
be a costly mistake. Con artists with 
access to your credit card number and 
expiration date can make unauthorized 
charges. 


Know how to separate 
fact from fraud 


Vadim A “lemon law” protects you 
on all big-ticket purchases, including 
used Cars. 


FACT: There is no universal lemon law 
that applies to all big-ticket items. The 
Missouri New Vehicles Warranty Law 
enforces a manufacturer’s expressed 
warranty for new motor vehicles and 
demonstrators or lease-purchase 
vehicles that were given a warranty as a 
condition of the sale. 


kaise Money cannot be taken 
directly from your bank account without 
your written authorization. 


FACT: Giving someone your checking 
account number may result in their 
making withdrawals. People can issue a 
“demand draft” to your bank, claiming 
you authorized the withdrawal. The bank 
may pay it although it lacks your 
signature. 


Wb@ismem Your credit report is private 
unless you authorize someone to review it. 


FACT: Potential employers, landlords, 
insurers and others may look at your 
report. Many do. 


Advertisements are 
accurate, or they would not be printed in 
the newspaper or broadcast on TV or 
radio. 


FACT: There is no law that ads be 
submitted to a governmental agency for 
advance review. The media generally 
don't investigate the truth of ads and 
don’t have to legally. 


IF YOU ARE having problems 
resolving a dispute over a rental deposit, 
purchase or service, you can try several 
remedies before filing a lawsuit as your 
last action. 

A carefully worded complaint, contact 
with your credit card company, or pursuit 
of monetary losses of up to $3,000 in 
small claims court all are options for you 
before turning to a lawyer. 


REGISTER A COMPLAINT 

Contact the offending party and try to 
settle your dispute first before contacting 
outside help. 


CONTACT BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU, 
ATTORNEY GENERAL 

Contact the Better Business Bureau and 
the Attorney General’s Office, 800-392- 
8222, and file a formal complaint if 
you're not satisfied with the business. If 
an individual or a business is violating the 
law, then results may be quicker if you 
contact both offices simultaneously. 

The BBB offers a free consumer 
arbitration service to settle disputes 
between businesses and consumers. Both 
parties must agree to the process and any 
decision of the arbitrator is legally 
binding. A lawyer is not needed. 


CONTACT CREDIT CARD COMPANY

disputed service or product, you may be 
able to recover your money. Write your 
credit card company a letter recording 
details of the matter. You must mail the 
letter within 60 days after you receive the 
disputed bill.

with problems such as a landlord who 
won't return a deposit or a repairman who 
said he fixed a pipe that still leaks. 

Under state law, consumers who have a 
claim for up to $3,000 can, without hiring 
a lawyer, file a lawsuit in small claims 
court to recoup their money. 

Before you sue, make sure there is no 
other way of settling your dispute. You 


may save yourself a lot of time and effort.

the associate circuit court of the county in 
which you live. The associate circuit 
court is housed in the county courthouse.

is located in another county or if the 
product or service was bought in another 
county, you should file suit in that county. 


Last action 
When other 
remedies fail 
and if small 
claims court

available to 


you, you may 
want to take 
your case to 
court. You 
might want to 
contact a 
lawyer to help.

rotection Hotline to check for complaints made 
against individuals or businesses.
