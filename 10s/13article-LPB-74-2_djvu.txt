Abstract.  This  paper  describes  a method  of  determining  the  stocking  density  and  volume  of  forest  stands  based 
on  airborne  laser-scanning  data.  The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  determine  the  relationship  between  ground-based 
measurements  of  standing  volume  and  tree-density,  and  those  acquired  based  on  the  Crown  Height  Model  (CHM) 
interpolated  from  airborne  laser  scanning  data.  Data  were  collected  from  34  sample  plots  of  two  sizes  for  the  CHM 
analysis:  500  m2  (radius  12.61  m)  and  1963.5  m2  (radius  of  25.0  m):  Trees  for  sampling  were  selected  using  two 
methods,  those  whose  “centroid”  was  fully  within  the  sample  plot  (the  tree  was  considered  to  be  within  the  sample 
plots  if  the  centroid  of  the  crown  was  inside  the  circle)  and  those  at  the  “border”  (the  tree  was  included  in  the  sample 
plot  if,  at  least,  one  part  of  the  contour  of  the  crown  was  inside  the  circle).  There  was  a strong  relationship  (R2  = 0.86) 
between  standing  volume  measured  in  sample  plots  on  the  ground  and  the  indices  produced  by  the  crown  elevation 
model  at  the  locations  where  the  ground-based  measurements  were  performed. 

Key  words:  centroid,  ground-based  data,  forest  inventory,  scaling,  airborne  ceiling,  Crown  Height  Model 


1.  Introduction 

Calculating  standing  volume  based  on  airborne 
ceiling  data  rests  on  searching  for  correlations  between 
measurements  obtained  from  the  airborne  ceiling  display 
and  standing  volume  ground-based  measurements  - most 
often  on  sample  plots  of  a few  hundred  square  metres. 
In  the  past,  measurements  acquired  from  airborne 
photographs  have  been  used  (Miscicki  2000,  2009; 
Korpela  i Tokola  2006).  Nowadays,  measurements,  on 
the  larger  scale,  are  used  that  are  obtained  from  Airborne 
Laser  Scanning  data  (Naesset  2004;  Breidenbach  et  al. 
2007;  Hyyppa  et  al.  2012). 

Applying  the  Airborne  Laser  Scanning  (ALS)  in 
the  analyses  of  forest  environment,  has  been  already 
described  in  Polish  field  literature  (Bqdkowski  2004; 
Wqzyk  2006;  Chirrek  et  al.  2007;  Sterenczak  2010a). 


The  most  important  advantages  of  the  method  are: 
obtaining  the  very  accurate  Canopy  Height  Model 
(CHM),  analysing  vertical  and  horizontal  forest 
structure,  and  some  other  tree-related  parameters.  Based 
on  previous  experiences,  two  groups  of  methods  can  be 
identified  to  determine  standing  volume.  Airborne  Laser 
Scanning  data  is  used  to  determine: 

- variables  of  single  trees  for  the  Individual  Tree 
Detection  (ITD)  method, 

- variables  of  plots  for  the  area-based  approach 
(ABA). 

A type  of  Airborne  Laser  Scanning  data  depends 
on  the  method  of  determining  the  standing  volume. 
When  information  about  individual  trees  is  used,  it  is 
advisable  to  apply  the  point  cloud  ALS  of  larger  density 
(about  4-5  points  per  m2)  to  separate  individual  tree 
crowns.  Regarding  methods  that  use  features  related

to  sample  plots,  it  is  possible  to  obtain  the  point  cloud 
of  lower  density  (about  0,5- 1 point  per  m2).  Advantages 
and  disadvantages  of  both  methods  are  compared  in 
Table  1. 

According  to  the  literature  (Korpela,  Tokola  2006; 
Wack  2006;  Hyyppa  et  al.  2012;  Straub,  Koch  2012), 
when  different  modelsofcorrelationsbetween  standing 
volume  based  on  the  measurements  and  variables 
of  ground  sample  plots  obtained  from  Airborne  Laser 
Scanning  data  is  used,  the  strength  of  relationship 
- determined  by  a correlation  coefficient  - is 
R=0,4-0,95.  The  strongest  correlation  has  been  in 
coniferous  stands,  especially  in  spruce  stands,  and 
the  weakest  in  deciduous  stands  (Korpela,  Tokola 
2006;  Wack  2006,  Hyyppa  et  al.  20 12).  For  individual 
trees  in  pine  stands,  a coefficient  of  determination  R2 
was  between  0,488  and  0,931  (Straub,  Koch  2012). 
Unfortunately,  there  are  not  many  publications 
related  to  forests  in  Central  Europe.  So  far,  according 
to  published  research,  each  model  needs  calibration 
with  respect  to  individual  forest  stands  (Breidenbach 
et  al.  2007).  Hence,  there  is  a need  for  conducting 
research  in  Poland  and  searching  for  models  based 
on  the  structure  of  Polish  forests  in  the  best  possible 
manner. 


2.  Research  materials 

Ground  sample  plots 

Research  materials  contain  data  collected  from  34 
circular  sample  plots  set  up  in  stands  of  the  Milicz  Forest 
District  (Regional  Office  of  State  Forests  in  Wroclaw; 
51°48’Ni  17°33’  E)  (Fig.  1). 

On  each  plot,  the  diameter  at  breast  height  and 
height  of  all  trees  that  qualified  for  the  sample  were 
measured  in  August  2006.  On  the  bases  of  polar 
coordinates,  trees’  locations  in  relation  to  the  centre  of 
the  sample  plot  were  determined.  Coordinates  of  the 
centres  of  sample  plots  were  calculated  by  the  forward 
differencing  method  using  GPS-Mobil  Maper.  The 
mean  measurement  error  was  2 m.  On  average,  the 
area  of  sample  plots  was  391  m2  that  varied  (according 
to  the  stand  age)  from  200  to  500  m2.  The  average 
stand  age  was  85  years  (between  15  and  150  years). 
Tree  species’  composition  was  diverse:  pine  was  the 
dominating  species  on  16  sample  plots,  beech  - 11, 
oak  - 3,  alder  - 2,  larch  - 1,  birch  - 1.  Average  level  of 
crown  closure  was  estimated  to  be  59%  (in  the  range 
of  20-95%).  A general  description  of  data  obtained 
from  the  sample  plots  was  as  follows:

tree  detection  of  area  based  approach  by  Hyyppa  et  al.  (2006) 


Advantages: 


Disadvantages: 


Area  based  method  of  standing  volume  estimation  (ALS  point  cloud  of  density  about  0.5-1  p/m2) 


- easy  integration  with  the  current  method  of  forest  stock 
inventory  by  using  the  same  reference  sample  plots 

- strong  statistical  background 

- relatively  low  cost  of  Airborne  Laser  Scanner  data 
acquisition 


- requires  large  number  of  accurate,  representative,  and 
thus  expensive  reference  data 

- a large  number  of  errors  in  inventory  as  a result  of 
insufficient  number  of  reliable  reference  data 


Individual  tree  detection  method  of  standing  volume  estimation  - ALS  point  cloud  of  density  about  4-5  p/m2 


- good  correlation  (existing  models)  with  the  estimated 
stand  volume 

- requires  small  number  of  reference  data  for  model 
calibration 

- increasing  the  number  of  parameters  describing  the 
forest,  so-called  precision  forestry 


- expensive  Airborne  Laser  Scanner  data  acquisition 

- a much  more  complex  system,  difficult  to  apply  in 
practice

- average  tree  height  - 23,9  m (in  the  range  of 
5-39  m), 

- dominant  height  (calculated  as  an  average  of  three 
tallest  trees  in  the  sample  plot)  - 26,1  m (in  the 
range  of  5-40  m), 

- average  tree  number  (of  at  least  7 cm  of  diameter 
of  breast  height)  in  the  sample  plot  - 16,2  (in  the 
range  of  0-33),  including  trees  of  the  first  floor  - 
14,4  (in  the  range  of  0-33), 

- average  standing  volume  - 330  mVha  (in  the  range 
of  0-665  m3/ha), 

- average  stem  density  of  at  least  7 cm  of  diameter 
of  breast  height  - 490  trees  per  ha  (in  the  range  of 
0-1300  trees  per  ha). 

Data  acquired  from  the  Airborne  Laser  Scanning 

Airborne  Laser  Scanning  data  acquired  between 
2.05.2007  and  3.05.2007  were  used  in  analyses. 


TopoSys  GmbH  FALCON  II  laser  scanner  of  fibre 
optic,  pulse  type  sensor  was  used  in  the  research. 
Length  of  the  wave  was  1560  nm.  Scanning  was 
performed  on  the  height  level  of  700  m with  83  kHz 
frequency,  scan  angle  of  ±7,1°  from  the  nadir. 
The  scanner  registered  the  first  echo  (FE)  and  the  last 
echo  (LE).  The  ground-based  scanning  spot  diameter 
was  0,7  m.  During  the  flight,  spectral  information 
of  R,  G,  B,  and  IR  channels  was  obtained  using  the 
data  scan  ruler.  Processing  pictorial  representation 
of  data  was  done  using  true-ortophotomap  of  0,25  m 
pixel  size. 

At  the  first  stage  of  processing.  Airborne  Laser 
Scanning  data  was  used  to  interpolate  Digital  Terrain 
Model  (DTM),  Digital  Surface  Model  (DSM),  and 
normalized  Digital  Surface  Model  (nDSM)  (Fig.  2), 
which  is  the  difference  between  corresponding  pixels  in 
DTM  and  DSM.  In  the  context  of  forest,  nDSM  is  called 
a Canopy  Height  Model  (CHM).

TreeVis  (FELIS  Freiburg  University)  program 
was  applied  to  filter  the  point  cloud  and  interpolate 
Digital  Terrain  Models.  Active  contours  algorithm 
(Elmqvist  2000),  that  is  used  to  filter  data  point,  was 
implemented. 

By  using  coordinates  of  sample  plot  centres  in 
a Canopy  Height  Model,  centres  were  indicated  and  circles 
were  formed.  Measurements  were  perfonned  inside  the 
circles.  Two  sizes  of  circles  were  applied:  500  m2  (radius 
12,61  m)  and  1963,5  m2  (radius  25,0  m).  It  implies  that  the 
sample  plots  defined  with  the  Canopy  Height  Model  were 
larger  (and  only  sometimes  equal)  than  the  ground  ones. 
Two  variants  of  tree  qualification  for  the  sample  were 
applied  for  each  sample  plot,  i.e.  “centroid”  variant  (the 
tree  was  considered  to  be  within  the  plot  if  the  centroid  of 
the  crown  was  inside  the  circle)  and  the  “border”  variant 
(the  tree  was  included  in  the  plot  if,  at  least,  one  part  of  the 
contour  of  the  crown  was  inside  the  circle). 

Then,  segmentation  of  tree  crowns  was  performed 
(Sterenczak  2010b).  A Canopy  Height  Model  was 
applied  by  conducting  following  procedures: 

- loading  a Canopy  Height  Model  and  its 
simplification  (smoothing)  using  a Gaussian  filter, 

- caring  out  the  first  segmentation,  generating 
primary  segments, 

- calculating  crown  height  layers, 

- assigning  primary  segments  to  height  classes, 

- reduction  of  height  classes  using  a Gaussian 
filter  of  different  size:  higher  layers  by  using 
larger  size,  and  lower  layers  by  using  smaller  size 
(3  height  layers  were  used  for  which  15  m and 
25  m were  boundary  values,  and  filter  size:  3><3, 
5x5,  7x7  pixels). 

After  separating  final  segments: 

- ranges  of  individual  tree  crowns  were  calculated; 
in  each  final  segment  we  determined  the  maximum 
value  of  elevation  Z of  the  point  belonging  to  the 


crown,  and  for  Digital  Terrain  Model  the  tree 
height  (HmJ, 

- pixels  located  below  the  0,7  xH  level  were 

1 7 max 

rejected, 

- for  each  selected  segment,  using  information 
about  H , the  crown  cross-sectional  area  was 

max3 

estimated  in  the  point  tagged  as  0,7 x/f  level. 

The  following  data,  describing  individual  tree 
qualifying  for  the  sample,  was  obtained  after  conducting 
the  following  measurements: 

- tree  height, 

- height  above  ground  level  of  the  lowest  observed 
part  of  the  crown, 

- crown  cross-sectional  area  at  height  equal  to  0,7  of 
the  tree  height,  that  is  consistent  with  theoretical 
height  of  a crown  placing  in  a dense  forest  stand, 

- maximum  crown  diameter  in  the  place  where  the 
cross  section  was  performed. 

Based  on  the  calculations  on  presented  data,  variables 
on  individual  sample  plots  were  estimated  (Fig.  3). 

Calculation  of  the  relationship  between  standing 
volume  and  stem  density  on  the  ground  sample  plots 
and  variables  obtained  from  a Canopy  Height  Model 
(CHM) 

We  calculated  multiple  regression  by  assuming 
that  one  of  variables  of  interest  obtained  from  ground- 
based  measurements  of  sample  plots  and  referred  to 
1 ha  (a  merchantable  timber  volume  V or  the  number 
of  all  trees  ZAG)  is  dependent  variables,  and  variables 
calculated  on  the  base  of  the  Canopy  Height  Model  (in 
the  spots  where  the  ground  sample  plots  were  projected) 
are  independent  ones.  We  used  a quadratic  function  of 
independent  variables  which  in  case  of  two  variables  t 
and  z has  a general  form:

1 . LD  = tree  number  inside 
sample  plot, 

2.  HL  = mean  height, 

3.  HG  = mean  heigh  for  3 tallest 
trees, 

4.  NH  = tree  height  sum, 

5.  P = sum  of  crown  vertical 
projections, 

6.  OZ  = tree  crown  volume  sum 
(crown  volume  was  counted  as  a 
volume  of  cone), 

7.  H = tree  height, 

8.  h = means  lenght  of  so  called 
visible  part  of  the  crown  in  CHM 
(minimum  0.7  of  tree  height).

Canopy  Height  Model  (CHM) 


y = aQ  + a(  + a^z  + a3t2  + a4z2  + a5tz 

A set  consisted  of  three  parameters  and  its  adequate 
squares  and  pairs  of  products  were  used  as  independent 
variables.  Three  parameters  were  applied,  since  each 
of  six  indicated  ones  obtained  from  a Canopy  Height 
Model  had  one  related  equivalent.  Therefore,  alternative 
pairs  were: 

- HL  and  HG, 

- LD  and  NH, 

- P and  OZ. 

Hence,  eight  combinations  of  base  parameters  were 
set.  Selection  of  variables  was  due  to  stepwise  backward 
regression,  using  the  ‘Statistica’  program. 

The  aforementioned  calculations  were  performed 
four  times.  We  took  into  consideration  that  independent 


variables  differed  according  to  both  the  sample  size  and 
the  means  of  qualifying  trees  (crowns)  for  the  sample. 

3.  Results 

Calculation  of  the  relationship  between  standing 
volume  on  the  ground  sample  plots  and  variables 
obtained  from  a Canopy  Height  Model  (CHM) 

Strength  of  the  relationship  between  the  standing 
volume  V on  the  ground  sample  plots  and  parameters 
indicated  for  a Canopy  Height  Model  was  different 
according  to  the  plot  size  and  a way  of  qualifying  trees 
for  the  sample.  The  strength  of  the  relationship  was  the 
highest  in  the  “centroid  500  m2”  plot,  and  the  smallest 
one  in  the  “border  1963,5  m2  plot  (Table  2).  In  general, 
the  correlation  can  be  valued  as  very  strong.  The 
highest  value  of  the  correlation  coefficient  was  7?=0,925 


132  S.  Miscicki  et  K.  Sterenczak/  Lesne  Prace  Badawcze  {Forest  Research  Papers),  2013,  Vol.  74  (2):  127-136. 


(p<0,001).  The  results  for  the  best  regression  model  of 
the  “centroid  500  m2”  plot  have  been  presented  in  Figure 
4.  Negative  values  resulted  from  using  a relatively  simple 
model.  To  avoid  it,  using  data  transformation  or  the 
regression  model  without  a free  parameter  is  advisable. 

For  the  “centroid  500  m2”  sample  plots,  especially 
three  sets  of  variables  were  useful.  Parameter  OZ  (total 
tree  crown  volume)  was  present  in  all  models.  Also  FIG 
(height  for  3 tallest  trees)  or  HL  (height)  and  LD  (tree 
number  inside  the  sample  plot)  or  NF1  (total  height  of 
trees))  can  be  recognized  as  equally  useful. 


Calculation  of  the  relationship  between  stem 
density  on  the  ground  sample  plots  and  variables 
obtained  from  a Canopy  Height  Model  (CHM) 

The  strength  of  the  relationship  between  stem  density 
ZAG  on  the  ground  sample  plots  and  that  estimated 
using  the  results  of  segmentation  on  the  Canopy  Height 
Model  differed  and  depended  on  the  plot  size  and  the 
means  of  qualifying  trees  for  the  sample.  In  case  of 
the  standing  volume,  the  correlation  was  strongest  for 
the  “centroid  500  m2”  plots  (the  highest  result  for  the 


Tables  2.  The  results  of  multiple  regression  calculations  describing  the  relationship  between  standing  volume  estimated  based  on 
ground  sample  plots  measurements  V and  variables  taken  from  Canopy  Height  Model.  Four  types  of  sample  plots  a different  in 
size  were  used  (equivalent  to  the  field)  and  the  way-off  qualification  trees  to  the  sample  (strongest  correlations  were  highlighted 
using  bold  font).

“border  500  m2”  plot  was  taken  as  coincidental),  and 
was  lowest  for  the  “border  1963,5  m2”  plot  (Table  3). 
in  general,  the  correlation  should  be  valued  as  very 
strong,  although,  it  was  weaker  when  compare  to 
standing  volume.  The  highest  value  of  the  correlation 
coefficient  was  R=0,888  (pO.OOl).  The  results  for  the 
best  regression  model  of  the  “centroid  500  m2”  plot 
are  presented  in  Figure  4.  Reasons  for  the  appearance 


of  negative  values  and  possibilities  for  avoiding  such  a 
situation  can  be  likely  explained  in  the  aforementioned 
calculations  of  the  standing  volume. 

HL  (mean  height),  OZ  (total  tree  crown  volume),  and 
NH  (total  height  of  trees)  were  the  best  set  of  variables 
for  the  “centroid  500  m2”  plot.  However,  changing  any 
of  these  parameters  into  HG  (mean  height  for  3 tallest

4.  Discussion 

Using  stands  of  the  Milicz  Forest  District  for  research, 
we  could  compare  application  results  of  Airborne  Laser 
Scanning  with  photogrammetric  measurements.  Taking 
results  of  the  Canopy  Height  Model  measurements 
as  potential  samples  of  the  first  phase  in  a two-phase 
inventory  method,  it  is  possible  to  compare  it  with  results 
of  similar  calculations  estimated  on  aerial  photographs 
in  the  1:10  000  scale  (Miscicki  2009).  In  the  cited 
research,  measurements  of  283  ground  sample  plots 


(267  located  in  over  20-year-old  stands)  have  been 
conducted  in  2005 . The  same  number  ofphotogrammetric 
sample  plots  (calculated  in  the  same  year,  2005), 
localized  on  the  spots  where  the  ground  plots  were 
projected,  has  been  used.  The  location  of  sample  plots 
in  2006,  used  in  our  research,  was  determined  by  the 
location  of  34  permanent  ground  sample  plots,  some  of 
which  have  been  used  in  the  cited  research  (Miscicki 
2009).  Therefore,  we  can  assume  that  the  research 
material  was  comparable,  and  hence,  residts  of  the 
research  on  applying  aerial  photographs  and  airborne 
laser  scanning  data  for  inventory  of  standing  volume 
using  combined  method  (two-phased)  are  comparable 
too. 


S.  Miscicki  et  K.  Sterenczak/  Lesne  Prace  Badawcze  (Forest  Research  Papers),  2013,  Vol.  74  (2):  127-136.  135 


Strength  of  the  relationship  (determined  by  a corre- 
lation coefficient)  between  standing  volume  calculated 
on  the  ground  sample  plots  and  variables  on  the  aerial 
photographs  was  R=0,830  (Miscicki  2009).  It  was 
however  lower  than  in  case  of  calculations  based  on 
parameters  obtained  from  the  Canopy  Height  Model 
(£=0,925). 

In  the  cited  research  (Miscicki  2009),  correlation 
between  stem  density  on  the  ground  sample  plots  and 
variables  on  photogrammetric  sample  plots  was  not 
calculated.  We  can  only  refer  to  the  previous  research 
(Miscicki  2000);  however  we  have  to  take  into  account 
that  in  2000,  the  photogrammetric  technique  was  at 
a slightly  lower  stage  of  development.  Hence,  better 
results  could  have  been  obtained  so  far.  Regarding 
density  of  trees,  strength  of  relationship  (/? — 0,697) 
was  considerably  smaller  than  it  was  for  samples 
where  the  Canopy  Height  Model  was  used.  Performing 
calculations  base  on  aerial  photographs,  stand  age  was 
recognized  as  an  additional  variable.  It  was  however  not 
used  in  our  research. 

Variables  applied  to  determine  standing  volume 
were  similar  to  the  ones  used  by  other  authors  (Hyyppa 
et  al.  2006,  2012;  Straub,  Koch  2012).  Unlike  Straub 
and  Koch  (2012),  in  our  research  results  based  on 
point  cloud  were  not  used  in  building  the  model. 
Nevertheless,  total  tree  crown  volume  information 
appeared  to  be  significant.  To  calculate  it,  data  based 
on  a Canopy  Height  Model  (interpolated  from  airborne 
laser  scanning  data)  was  used. 

The  strength  of  relationship  between  the  standing 
volume  measured  on  the  ground  sample  plots  and 
variables  based  on  the  Canopy  Height  Model,  was 
higher  than  the  relationship  between  the  standing 
volume  measured  on  the  ground  sample  plots  and 
variables  calculated  on  aerial  sample  plots  measured 
using  photogrammetric  methods.  It  shows  that 
the  automation,  regarding  analyses  of  results  of 
interpolating  airborne  laser  scanning  data,  is  a new  (and 
better)  opportunity  for  calculations  performed  by  the 
combined  method.  For  instance,  standing  volume  of 
the  Milicz  Forest  District  of  7599  ha  forest  area,  using 
267  ground  sample  plots  (as  a part  of  the  inventory 
performed  by  the  combined  method)  and  1980  aerial 
sample  plots  based  on  variables  determined  with 
a Canopy  Height  Model,  could  have  been  estimated  with 
the  error  about  ±2,6%  (p=0,05).  This  type  of  accuracy 
could  be  very  close  to  the  one  which  was  achieved  from 
the  forest  inventory  using  835  ground  sample  plots. 
Further  increase  in  the  number  of  sample  plots  obtained 


from  the  Canopy  Height  Model  would  improve  the 
accuracy  of  the  inventory.  Suggested  solution  seems 
possible,  because  the  cost  of  automatic  calculation 
depends  on  the  number  of  samples  used  in  the  Canopy 
Height  Model  in  a lesser  degree,  and  it  is  limited  only  by 
the  time  of  processing  data.  Complete  automation  of  the 
process,  after  receiving  results  from  the  ground  sample 
plots,  would  allow  estimation  of  the  standing  volume  of 
the  forest  district  within  a few  days. 

5.  Conclusion 

1)  It  is  advisable  to  use  the  same  size  of  the  sample 
plots  established  in  the  ground  as  well  on  the  Canopy 
Height  Model.  Relationship  between  standing  volume 
(or  stem  density)  on  the  ground  plots  and  variables  on 
the  Canopy  Height  Model  plots  worsened  when  the 
latter  were  larger  than  the  ground  ones. 

2)  “Centroid”  method  is  a better  solution  of 
qualifying  tree  for  the  sample. 

3)  Total  tree  crown  volume  (OZ)  is  the  variable, 
calculated  on  the  Canopy  Height  Model  that  is  especially 
useful  for  estimation  of  the  standing  volume  and  stem 
density.  Other  variables  such  as  height  (HG  - mean 
height  for  3 tallest  trees  or  HL  - mean  height),  number 
of  trees  inside  the  sample  plot  (LD),  or  the  tree  height 
sum  (NH)  can  also  be  used.  They  are  of  the  similar 
importance  to  the  explanation  of  the  relationship 
between  variables  measured  on  the  ground  sample  plots 
and  that  obtained  from  the  Canopy  Height  Model.
