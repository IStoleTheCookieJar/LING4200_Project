INTRODUCTION 1 This publication contains latest figures for a comprehensive range of economic 


indicators. Statistics shown in this publication are the latest available at the date of 
preparation and may be subject to revision in subsequent issues. In a number of cases 
figures appearing in this publication are preliminary and are subject to revision in 
subsequent issues. Reference should therefore always be made to the latest issue or to 
the statistical publication on the specific subject. 


SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT 2 Seasonal adjustment is a means of removing the estimated effects of normal 

AND TREND ESTIMATION _ seasonal variation from the series so that the effects of other influences on the series can 
be more clearly recognised. Seasonal adjustment does not aim to remove the irregular 
or non-seasonal influences which may be present in any particular month. This means 
that month-to-month movements of the seasonally adjusted estimates may not be 
reliable indicators of trend behaviour. 


3 The smoothing of seasonally adjusted series reduces the impact of the 
irregular components of the seasonally adjusted series and creates trend estimates. 
These trend estimates are derived by applying a 13-term Henderson-weighted moving 
average to all months except the last six. The last six monthly trend estimates are 
obtained by applying surrogates of the Henderson average to the seasonally adjusted 
series. Trend series are used to measure the underlying behaviour of the series over 
time. 


4 While this smoothing technique enables estimates to be produced for the 
latest month, it does result in revisions to the most recent months as additional 
observations become available. Generally, subsequent revisions become smaller and 
after 3 months have a negligible impact on the series. Revisions also occur as a result of 
the annual review of seasonal factors.

Deaths of children under one year of age. 

Total fertility rate. The sum of age-specific fertility rates (live births at each age of mother per female population of that age). It represents the 
number of children a woman would bear during her lifetime if she experienced current age-specific fertility rates at each age of her reproductive life. 
Standardised death rate. The overall death rate, per 1,000 persons, that would have prevailed in a standard population if it had experienced at each 
age the death rates of the population being studied. The standard population used in these calculations is all persons in the 1991 Australian 
population. 

Rate per 1,000 live births. 

Crude marriage rate is the number of marriages registered during the calendar year, per 1,000 estimated resident population at 30 June of that year.

It is difficult to get a complete picture of Tasmania’s trade performance as imports recorded by the ABS include only goods imported directly into 


the State from overseas, and reported by the Australian Customs Service. Many of Tasmania’s goods imported for direct consumption, or input into 
further processing industries, arrive via interstate ports, and are not included in this table. 
2 Includes re-exports.
